      <text xml:space="preserve">'''''Inedia''''' (Latin: &quot;[[fasting]]&quot;) is the ability to live without [[food]].   The word was first used to describe a fast-based lifestyle within Catholic tradition, which holds that certain [[saint]]s were able to survive for extended periods of time without food or drink other than the [[Eucharist]].

'''Breatharianism''' is a related concept, in which believers claim food and possibly [[water]] are not necessary, and that humans can be sustained solely by [[prana]] (the vital life force in [[Hinduism]]), or, according to some, by the energy in [[sunlight]] (according to [[Ayurveda]], [[sunlight]] is one of the main sources of [[prana]]). The terms ''breatharianism'' or ''inedia'' may also refer to this philosophy practised as a [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] in place of the usual [[diet (nutrition)|diet]].

While there is not peer-verified scientific support for the claims, some promote the practices of breatharianism as a skill which can be learned through specific techniques.&lt;ref name=&quot;Initiation workshops&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.breatharian.com/initiationworkshops.html |title=Wiley Brooks website: Initiation workshops |publisher=Breatharian.com |date= |accessdate=30 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific basis==
[[Nutrition]] science indicates that fasting for extended periods leads to [[starvation]], [[dehydration]], and eventual death. Carbohydrates, fats, and proteins are the body's only observed sources of energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://women.webmd.com/guide/nutrition-101-how-to-eat-healthy |title=How to Eat Healthy. WebMD |publisher=Women.webmd.com |date= |accessdate=30 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=55692 |title=Test Your Weight Loss Wisdom. MedicineNet |publisher=Medicinenet.com |date= |accessdate=30 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mckinley.uiuc.edu/handouts/macronutrients.htm |title=Macronutrients: the Importance of Carbohydrate, Protein, and Fat |publisher=Mckinley.uiuc.edu |date= |accessdate=30 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the absence of calorie intake, the body normally burns its own reserves of glycogen, body fat, and muscle.  Breatharians claim that their bodies do not consume these reserves while fasting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://recipes.howstuffworks.com/breatharian1.htm |title=What happens to your body as a breatharian? Howstuffworks |publisher=Recipes.howstuffworks.com |date= |accessdate=30 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Few breatharians have submitted themselves to medical testing; of those that have, including a hospital's observation of an Indian mystic surviving without food or water for 15 days,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wusa9.com/news/watercooler/story.aspx?storyid=100671&amp;catid=148 Hermit Claims 70 Years Survival Without Food&lt;/ref&gt; none have undergone peer review with results independently reproduced. In a handful of documented cases, individuals attempting breatharian fasting have died,&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC&quot;&gt;{{cite news

==Practitioners==
===Jasmuheen===
[[Jasmuheen]] (born Ellen Greve) was a prominent advocate of breatharianism in the 1990s. She claimed &quot;I can go for months and months without having anything at all other than a cup of tea. My body runs on a different kind of nourishment.&quot;{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Interviewers found her house stocked with food; Jasmuheen claimed the food was for her husband. In 1999, she volunteered to be monitored closely by the [[Australia]]n television program ''[[60 Minutes (Australian TV program)|60 Minutes]]'' for one week without eating to demonstrate her methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sixtyminutes.ninemsn.com.au/60/stories/1999_10_24/story_57.asp|title=Living on air: Breatharian put to the test|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20051102085047/http://sixtyminutes.ninemsn.com.au/60/stories/1999_10_24/story_57.asp|archivedate=2 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.ratbags.com/rsoles/comment/jasmuheen.htm |title = Jasmuheen |accessdate = 7 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jasmuheen stated that she failed on the first day of the test because the hotel room in which she was confined was located near a busy road, causing [[stress (medicine)|stress]] and [[pollution]] that prevented absorption of required nutrients from the air. &quot;I asked for fresh air. Seventy percent of my nutrients come from fresh air. I couldn’t even breathe,&quot; she said. The third day the test was moved to a mountainside retreat. After fasting for four days, Dr. Berris Wink, president of the Queensland branch of the Australian Medical Association, urged her to stop the test.

According to Dr. Wink, Jasmuheen’s pupils were dilated, her speech was slow, and she was &quot;quite dehydrated, probably over 10%, getting up to 11%&quot;. Towards the end of the test, she said, &quot;Her pulse is about double what it was when she started. The risks if she goes any further are kidney failure. ''60 Minutes'' would be culpable if they encouraged her to continue. She should stop now&quot;. The test was stopped. Dr. Wink said, &quot;Unfortunately there are a few people who may believe what she says, and I'm sure it's only a few, but I think it's quite irresponsible for somebody to be trying to encourage others to do something that is so detrimental to their health&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | date = 25 October 1999 |title = Fresh-air dietician fails TV show's challenge |work = Yahoo News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jasmuheen challenged the results of the program, saying, &quot;Look, 6,000 people have done this around the world without any problem.&quot;{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Though she claims thousands of followers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Harris | first = Gillian | date = 6 April 2000 | title = Starvation guru given hostile reception | work = The Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://liberatapublishers.com/mysticism.htm |title = Mysticism |accessdate = 7 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; mostly in Germany,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Steiner | first = Susie | date = 21 September 1999
| title = Face behind food-free teaching | work = The London Times }}&lt;/ref&gt; there has been no verification that any have lived for extended periods without food.

Jasmuheen was awarded the [[Bent Spoon Award]] by [[Australian Skeptics]] in 2000 (&quot;presented to the perpetrator of the most preposterous piece of paranormal or pseudoscientific piffle&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.skeptics.com.au/spoon/2000winners.htm |title = Bent Spoon 2000 – Winner (Jasmuheen) |accessdate = 7 June 2008}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She also won the 2000 [[Ig Nobel Prize]] for Literature for ''Living on Light''. Jasmuheen claims that their beliefs are based on the writings and &quot;more recent [[channelling (mediumistic)|channelled]] material&quot; from [[St. Germain (Theosophy)|St. Germain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/454313.stm | date = 22 September 1999 |title = All they need is the air | work = BBC News | accessdate = 11 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She stated that her [[DNA]] has expanded from 2 to 12 strands, to &quot;absorb more hydrogen&quot;. When offered $30,000 to prove her claim with a blood test, she said that she didn't understand the relevance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | year = 1997 | url = http://www.abc.net.au/science/correx/archives/jasmuheen.htm |title = Correx Archives&amp;nbsp;— Jasmuheen | work = Corex | publisher = Australian Broadcasting Corporation | accessdate = 7 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Deaths of Jasmuheen's followers====
The deaths of 49-year-old Australian-born Scotland resident Verity Linn, 31-year-old Munich preschool teacher Timo Degen, and 53-year-old Melbourne resident Lani Marcia Roslyn Morris while attempting the breatharian &quot;diet&quot; advocated by Jasmuheen have elicited criticism.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SundayTimes&quot; /&gt; [[Jim Vadim Pesnak]], 63, and his wife Eugenia, 60, went to jail for six and two years on charges of manslaughter for their involvement in the death of Morris, when Pesnak delayed seeking medical attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sands|first=Judy|title=Prison for air cult disciples|newspaper=Courier-Mail|date=27 November 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jasmuheen claimed that Linn's death had a psycho-spiritual, rather than physiological, source.

Jasmuheen has denied any involvement with the three deaths and claims she cannot be held responsible for the actions of her followers. In reference to the death of Lani Morris, she said that perhaps Morris was &quot;not coming from a place of integrity and did not have the right motivation&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;SundayTimes&quot; /&gt;

===Wiley Brooks===
Wiley Brooks is founder of the Breatharian Institute of America. He was first introduced to the public in 1980 when appearing on the TV show ''[[That's Incredible!]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;SeattleTimes&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url = http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19931005&amp;slug=1724507 | title = Living On Light, Air – 'Breatharian' Says Food Is Poison But Pops An Occasional Twinkie | publisher = Seattle Times | last = Broom | first = Jack | date = 1993-10-05 | accessdate = 12 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Brooks stopped teaching recently to &quot;devote 100% of his time on solving the problem as to why he needed to eat some type of food to keep his [[physical body]] alive and allow his [[Subtle body|light body]] to manifest completely.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;altinate&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.breatharian.com/WileyBrooks-altinate.htm |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060211031744/http://www.breatharian.com/WileyBrooks-altinate.htm |archivedate=11 February 2006 |title=Wiley Brooks website through Internet Archive |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=11 February 2006 |accessdate=30 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Brooks believes to have found &quot;four major deterrents&quot; which prevented him from living without food: &quot;people pollution&quot;, &quot;food pollution&quot;, &quot;air pollution&quot; and &quot;electro pollution&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;altinate&quot;/&gt;

In 1983 he was reportedly observed leaving a [[Santa Cruz, California|Santa Cruz]] [[7-Eleven]] with a [[Slurpee]], [[hot dog]] and [[Twinkie]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.metroactive.com/papers/cruz/01.05.00/nuzjunkies-0001.html |title = MetroActive News &amp; Issues | A Year of Nüz |accessdate = 7 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He told ''[[Colors (magazine)|Colors]]'' magazine in 2003 that he periodically breaks his fasting with a [[cheeseburger]] and a [[cola]], explaining that when he's surrounded by junk culture and [[junk food]], consuming them adds balance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metroactive.com/papers/sonoma/02.13.03/diets-0307.html |title=sonoma papers |publisher=Metroactive.com |date= |accessdate=30 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On his website, Brooks states that his potential followers must first prepare by combining the junk food diet with the meditative incantation of five magic &quot;fifth-dimensional&quot; words which appear on his website, some of which are words from Kundalini yoga.&lt;ref name=&quot;five_magical_words-download&quot;&gt;[http://www.breatharian.com/images/The_five_magical_words-download_2.doc Five magic words download] (MS Word document)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Five magic words&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.breatharian.com/fivemagicwords.html |title=Wiley Brooks website: Five magic words |publisher=Breatharian.com |date= |accessdate=30 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the &quot;5D Q&amp;A&quot; section of his website Brooks explains that cows are fifth-dimensional (or higher) beings that help mankind achieve fifth-dimensional status by converting three-dimensional food to five-dimensional food (beef).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.breatharian.com/qa5magicwords.html Q and A five magic words]&lt;br&gt;[http://www.breatharian.com/5wordsqa/holycows.html Holy cows section]&lt;/ref&gt; In the &quot;Question and Answer&quot; section of his website, Brooks explains that the &quot;Double Quarter-Pounder with Cheese&quot; meal from [[McDonald's]] possesses a special &quot;base frequency&quot; and that he thus recommends it as occasional food for beginning breatharians.&lt;ref name=&quot;Q&amp;A&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.breatharian.com/5wordsqa.html |title=5 magic words Q&amp;A |publisher=Breatharian.com |date= |accessdate=30 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then goes on to reveal that [[Diet Coke]] is &quot;liquid light&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Q&amp;A&quot;/&gt; Prospective disciples are asked after some time following the junk food/magic word preparation to revisit his website in order to test if they can feel the magic.&lt;ref name=&quot;Five magic words&quot;/&gt;

Brooks states that he may be contacted on his fifth-dimensional phone in order to get the correct pronunciation of the five magic words.&lt;ref name=&quot;Five magic words&quot; /&gt; In case the line is busy, prospective recruits are asked to meditate on the five magic words for a few minutes, and then try calling again.&lt;ref name=&quot;Five magic words&quot;/&gt; 

Brooks's institute has charged varying fees to prospective clients who wished to learn how to live without food, which have ranged from  US$100,000 with an initial deposit of US$10,000&lt;ref name=&quot;Initiation workshops&quot;/&gt; to $1,000,000,000.00 USD (one billion dollars), to be paid via bank [[wire transfer]] with a preliminary deposit of $100,000.00 USD, for a session called &quot;Immortality workshop&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Immortality workshop&quot;&gt;[http://www.breatharian.com/immortalityworkshop.html Immortality workshop] Retrieved 21 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; A payment plan was also offered.&lt;ref name=&quot;Initiation workshops Internet Archive&quot;&gt;

===Hira Ratan Manek===
[[Hira Ratan Manek]] (born September 12, 1937) claims that since June 18, 1995, he has lived on water, and, occasionally, [[tea]], [[coffee]], and [[buttermilk]]. Manek states that sunlight is the key to his health, citing the [[Jainism|Jainist]] [[Tirthankara]] [[Mahavira]], ancient [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]], [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]], and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] as his inspiration.

According to his website, three extended periods of his fasting have been observed under control of scientific and medical teams, the first lasting 211 days in 1995–96, in [[Calicut|Calicut, India]], under the direction of Dr C. K. Ramachandran. During that period he is reported to have lost 41&amp;nbsp;kg.&lt;ref name=&quot;niejedzenie1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = http://niejedzenie.info/english/hiraratanmanek.htm |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20050301181035/http://niejedzenie.info/english/hiraratanmanek.htm |archivedate=1 March 2005 |title = Hira Ratan Manek |accessdate = 7 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second study lasted 411 days in 2000–2001, in [[Ahmedabad|Ahmedabad, India]], under the direction of a 21 member team of medical doctors and scientists led by doctors Sudhir Shah and K. K. Shah, a past President of the [[Indian Medical Association]] and current Chairman of the [http://www.jaindoctorsfederation.org/ Jainist Doctors' Federation] (the latter group aims to &quot;Promote scientific research and medical education based on principles of Jainism&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.jaindoctorsfederation.org/aimsandobjectives.html |title = ::: Aims &amp;Amp; Objectives Of Jdf ::: |accessdate = 7 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr K. K. Shah said &quot;Fasting is a method of curing the meditation of mind and body which has been proved by great jain monks, sanyasis and munis of ancient times. There is a need to propagate these methods during this age of increasing diseases of the body and mind due to over consumptions and increasing with fasting would help maintain perfection.&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;niejedzenie1&quot;/&gt; Dr Sudhir Shah was also involved in the study of Prahlad Jani.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.amazingabilities.com/amaze5a.html |title = Unexplained Mysteries, Unexplained Mystery, Unexplained Mysteries.

The paper&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.amazingabilities.com/amaze5c.html |title = Fasting, Prolonged Fasting, Fasting, Hira Manek Prolonged Fasting Medical Report |accessdate = 7 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; published by Dr Sudhir Shah makes it clear that dozens of people had access to Hira Ratan Manek during the study and he went on at least one excursion: &quot;Most surprisingly, he had himself climbed the famous Shatrunjay mountain (Palitana hill) on 4.4.01, on 401st day of his legendary fasting along with 500 fellowmen without anybody’s help, within 1.5 Hrs. only&quot;. The paper reports that the subject lost 19&amp;nbsp;kg of weight during the study period. Neither the experiment, as described in the paper, nor the paper itself have been validated by any other well-known scientific or medical journal.

A third study allegedly lasted for 130 days in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], at [[Thomas Jefferson University]] and the [[University of Pennsylvania]] under the direction of Dr. Andrew Newberg and  Dr. George C. Brainard. Dr Sudhir Shah, who led the previous study, acted as an advisor and consultant to the USA team. However, Dr. Andrew Newberg said that Hira stayed at the University of Pennsylvania only for brain scans on studies of meditation, not his ability to fast indefinitely. Following that statement, Newberg denied ever undertaking the 130-day study.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}

===Prahlad Jani (&quot;Mataji&quot;)===
[[Prahlad Jani]] is an Indian 81 year old [[sadhu]] who has claimed to have lived without food and water for the last 70 years. His ability to live without food and water was investigated by doctors at Sterling Hospital, [[Ahmedabad]], [[Gujarat]] in 2003 and 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dasgupta-Hindu&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url = http://beta.thehindu.com/news/national/article425184.ece |title = The Hindu – DIPAS concludes observational study on ‘Mataji' |accessdate = 15 June 2010 |author = Manas Dasgupta | date= 9 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The research team reported that he did not consume any food or water during the testing periods, although they could not comment on his claim of having been able to survive in this way for 70 years.&lt;ref name=DNAIndia&gt;[http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report_experts-baffled-as-mataji-s-medical-reports-are-normal_1380169 Experts baffled as Mataji's medical reports are normal]&lt;/ref&gt; The study concluded that Prahlad Jani was able to survive under observation for two weeks without either food or water, and had passed no [[urine]] or [[feces|stool]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Khanna-bbc&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/3236118.stm |title = Fasting fakir flummoxes physicians |accessdate = 7 June 2008 |author = Rajeev Khanna | date=25 November 2003 |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; with no need for [[dialysis]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/Health/International/man-eat-drink/story?id=10787036 Scientists Baffled by Prahlad Jani, Man Who Doesn't Eat or Drink]&lt;/ref&gt;

Interviews with the researchers speak of strict observation and relate that round-the-clock observation was ensured by multiple [[CCTV]] cameras. Jani was reportedly subjected to multiple medical tests.&lt;ref name=&quot;DNAIndia&quot;/&gt; Jani's only contact with any form of fluid was during gargling and bathing, and the doctors said they measured the fluid that Jani spat out.&lt;ref name=&quot;dailymail&quot;/&gt;

The case has attracted criticism, both after 2003 tests and after the recent 2010 tests. [[Sanal Edamaruku]], president of the [[Indian Rationalist Association]], criticized the 2010 experiment for allowing Jani to move out of a certain CCTV camera's field of view, meet devotees and leave the sealed test room to sunbathe. Edamaruku stated that the regular gargling and bathing activities were not sufficiently monitored,&lt;ref name=&quot;rationalistinternational1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Edamaruku |first=Sanal |url=http://www.rationalistinternational.net/article/2010/20100518/en_1.html |title=Prahlad Jani and his powerful protectors |publisher=Rationalistinternational.net |date=18 May 2010 |accessdate=14 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and accused Jani of having had some &quot;influential protectors&quot; who denied Edamaruku permission to inspect the project during its operation.&lt;ref name=&quot;rationalistinternational1&quot;/&gt;

'''Belfast''' ({{Irish derived place name|Béal Feirste|mouth of the [[Shoal|sandbars]]}}) is the [[capital (political)|capital]] of and largest city in [[Northern Ireland]], as well as the second largest city on the island of [[Ireland]]. It is the seat of [[Devolution#United Kingdom|devolved]] [[Northern Ireland Executive|government]] and legislative [[Northern Ireland Assembly]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MSN Encarta&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title = Northern Ireland | work = MSN Encarta – Northern Ireland | publisher = Microsoft | url = http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761571415/Northern_Ireland.html | accessdate = 2007-10-29 | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/query?id=1257012982925640 | archivedate = 2009-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city forms part of the largest [[urban area]] in Northern Ireland, and the main settlement in the province of [[Ulster]]. The city of Belfast has a population of 267,500&lt;ref name=&quot;demography1&quot; /&gt; and lies at the heart of the [[Greater Belfast|Belfast urban area]], which has a population of 483,418. The [[Larger Urban Zone]], as defined by the [[European Union]], has a total population 641,638. Belfast was granted [[City status in the United Kingdom#Northern Ireland|city status]] in 1888.

Historically, Belfast has been a centre for the Irish [[linen]] industry (earning the nickname &quot;[[Linenopolis]]&quot;), tobacco production, rope-making and shipbuilding: the city's main shipbuilders, [[Harland and Wolff]], which built the ill-fated ''[[RMS Titanic]]'', propelled Belfast on to the global stage in the early 20th century as the largest and most productive shipyard in the world. Belfast played a key role in the [[Industrial Revolution]], establishing its place as a global industrial centre until the latter half of the 20th century.

Industrialisation and the inward migration it brought made Belfast, if briefly, the largest city in Ireland at the turn of the 20th century and the city's industrial and economic success was cited by [[Unionism in Ireland|Ulster unionist]] opponents of [[Irish Home Rule|Home Rule]] as a reason why Ireland should shun devolution and later why Ulster in particular would fight to resist it.

Today, Belfast remains a centre for [[industry]], as well as the [[arts]], [[higher education]] and [[business]], a legal centre, and is the economic engine of Northern Ireland. The city suffered greatly during the period of disruption, conflict, and destruction called [[the Troubles]], but latterly has undergone a sustained period of calm, free from the intense political violence of former years, and substantial economic and commercial growth. [[Belfast city centre]] has undergone considerable expansion and regeneration in recent years, notably around [[Victoria Square (Belfast)|Victoria Square]].

Belfast is served by two airports: [[George Best Belfast City Airport]] in the city, and [[Belfast International Airport]] {{convert|15|mi|km|0}} west of the city. Belfast is also a major [[seaport]], with commercial and industrial docks dominating the [[Belfast Lough]] shoreline, including the famous Harland and Wolff shipyard. Belfast is a constituent city of the [[Dublin-Belfast corridor]], which has a population of three million, or half the total population of the island of Ireland.

== Name ==
The name ''Belfast'' is derived from the [[Irish language|Irish]] ''Béal Feirsde'', which was later spelled ''Béal Feirste''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dil.ie/browse-small.asp ''Dictionary of the Irish Language'']: ''bél'' (Letter B, Column 61); ''fertas'' (Letter F, Column 96).&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''béal'' means &quot;mouth&quot; while ''feirsde/feirste'' is the genitive singular of ''fearsaid'' and refers to a [[shoal|sandbar]] or tidal [[ford (crossing)|ford]] across a river's mouth.&lt;ref name=&quot;Logainm&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.logainm.ie/?text=Belfast&amp;placeID=118005&amp;uiLang=en |title=Placenames Database of Ireland – Belfast |publisher=Logainm.ie |date= |accessdate=2010-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Belfast name&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Placenames/Logainmneacha – Belfast | work = BBC Northern Ireland – Education | publisher = BBC | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/northernireland/irish/blas/education/beginnersblas/1belfast.shtml | accessdate = 2007-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name would thus translate literally as &quot;mouth of the sandbar&quot; or &quot;mouth of the ford&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Logainm&quot; /&gt; This sandbar was formed at the confluence of two rivers at what is now Donegall Quay: the [[River Lagan|Lagan]], which flows into [[Belfast Lough]], and its tributary the [[River Farset|Farset]]. This area was the hub around which the original settlement developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Keenan | first = Desmond | title = Pre-Famine Ireland | pages = Chapter 5 | publisher = XLibris.com | url = http://www.deskeenan.com/4PrChapter5.htm | year= 2000 | nopp = true}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Irish name ''Béal Feirste'' is shared by a [[townland]] in [[County Mayo]], whose name has been anglicised as ''Belfarsad''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.logainm.ie/37016.aspx |title=Placenames Database of Ireland - Belfarsad |publisher=Logainm.ie |date= |accessdate=2010-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As sandbars have no mouths, an alternative interpretation of the name is &quot;mouth of [the river] of the sandbar&quot;, an allusion to the River Farset, which flows into the Lagan where the sandbar was located. This interpretation was favoured by [[Edmund Hogan]] and [[John O'Donovan (scholar)|John O'Donovan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Onomasticon Goedelicum |last=Hogan |first=Edmund |year=1910 |location=Dublin |url=http://publish.ucc.ie/doi/locus/B}}; {{Cite book|title=Annals of the Kingdom of Ireland |last=O'Donovan |first=John |year=1856 |location=Dublin |url=http://www.archive.org/stream/annalarioghachta04ocle#page/1100/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; It seems clear, however, that the river was also named after the tidal crossing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Logainm&quot; /&gt;

== History ==
{{Main|History of Belfast}}
Although the [[county borough]] of Belfast was created when it was granted city status by [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] in 1888,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Belfast City Hall | work = Discover Northern Ireland | publisher = Ireland Tourist Board | url = http://www.discovernorthernireland.com/product.aspx?ProductID=2782 | accessdate = 2007-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; the city continues to be viewed as straddling [[County Antrim]] and [[County Down]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Belfast, Newcastle and the County Down Coast | work = County Down Northern Ireland | publisher = GoIreland.com | url = http://www.countydown.com/ | accessdate = 2009-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Origins ===
[[File:Belfast Castle.JPG|thumb|Belfast Castle]]
The site of Belfast has been occupied since the [[Bronze Age]]. The [[Giants Ring, Belfast|Giant's Ring]], a 5,000-year-old [[henge]], is located near the city, and the remains of [[Iron Age]] [[hill fort]]s can still be seen in the surrounding hills. Belfast remained a small settlement of little importance during the [[High Middle Ages|Middle Ages]]. [[John de Courcy]] built a castle on what is now Castle Street in the city centre in the 12th century, but this was on a lesser scale and not as strategically important as [[Carrickfergus Castle]] to the north, which was built by de Courcy in 1177. The [[O'Neill dynasty|O'Neill]] clan had a presence in the area. In the 14th century, Clan Aedh Buidh, descendants of Hugh O'Neill built Grey Castle at Castlereagh, now in the east of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Komesu | first = Okifumi | title = Irish Writers and Politics | page = 73 | publisher = Rowman &amp; Littlefield | url = http://books.google.com/?id=AwFO2Z8Bk0YC&amp;pg=PA73&amp;lpg=PA73&amp;dq=%22yellow+hugh+o+neill%22 | year= 1990 | isbn = 9780389209263}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Conn O'Neill]] also owned land in the area, one remaining link being the Conn's Water river flowing through east Belfast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.theflightoftheearls.net/May2406.pdf |title=Celebrations mark the arrival of first Ulster Scots in Ireland |publisher=Irish News |date=2006-04-24 |accessdate=2007-09-18|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Growth ===
Belfast became a substantial settlement in the 17th century after being established as a town by [[Arthur Chichester, 1st Baron Chichester|Sir Arthur Chichester]], which was initially settled by Protestant English and Scottish migrants at the time of the [[Plantation of Ulster]]. (Belfast and County Antrim, however, did not form part of this particular Plantation scheme as they were privately colonised.) In 1791, the [[Society of United Irishmen]] was founded in Belfast, after [[Henry Joy McCracken]] and other prominent Presbyterians from the city invited [[Theobald Wolfe Tone]] and [[Thomas Russell (rebel)|Thomas Russell]] to a meeting, after having read Tone's &quot;Argument on Behalf of the Catholics of Ireland&quot;. Evidence of this period of Belfast's growth can still be seen in the oldest areas of the city, known as the [[The Belfast Entries|Entries]].

Belfast blossomed as a commercial and industrial centre in the 18th and 19th centuries and became Ireland's pre-eminent industrial city. Industries thrived, including [[linen]], rope-making, tobacco, heavy engineering and shipbuilding, and at the end of the 19th century, Belfast briefly overtook Dublin as the largest city in Ireland. The [[Harland and Wolff]] shipyards became one of the largest shipbuilders in the world, employing up to 35,000 workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/3176184.stm |title=Cranes to remain on city skyline |publisher=BBC News |date=2003-10-09 |accessdate=2007-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1920-22, Belfast became the capital of the new entity of Northern Ireland as the island of Ireland was partitioned. The accompanyinging conflict (the [[Irish War of Independence]]) cost up to 500 lives in Belfast, the bloodiest sectarian strife in the city until the &quot;Troubles&quot; of the late 1960s onwards.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Lynch, The Northern IRA and the Early YEars of Partition, p227&lt;/ref&gt;

Belfast was [[Belfast Blitz|heavily bombed]] during [[World War II]]. In one raid, in 1941, German bombers killed around one thousand people and left tens of thousands homeless. Outside of London, this was the greatest loss of life in a night raid during the [[The Blitz|Blitz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/1269206.stm |title=The Belfast blitz is remembered |publisher=BBC News |date=2001-04-11 |accessdate=2007-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Troubles ===
{{Main|The Troubles}}

Belfast has been the capital of Northern Ireland since its establishment in 1921 following the [[Government of Ireland Act 1920]]. It had been the scene of various episodes of sectarian conflict between its [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] and [[Protestantism|Protestant]] populations. These opposing groups in this conflict are now often termed [[Irish republicanism|republican]] and [[Ulster loyalism|loyalist]] respectively, although they are also referred to as '[[Irish nationalism|nationalist]]' and '[[Unionism (Ireland)|unionist]]'. The most recent example of this conflict was known as [[the Troubles]] – a civil conflict that raged from around 1969 to the late 1990s. Belfast saw some of the worst of the Troubles in Northern Ireland, particularly in the 1970s, with rival paramilitary groups formed on both sides. Bombing, assassination and street violence formed a backdrop to life throughout the Troubles. The [[Provisional IRA]] detonated 22 bombs within the confines of Belfast city centre in 1972, on what is known as &quot;[[Bloody Friday (1972)|Bloody Friday]]&quot;, killing nine people. Loyalist paramilitaries including the [[Ulster Volunteer Force]] (UVF) and the [[Ulster Defence Association]] (UDA) claimed that the killings they carried out were in retaliation for the [[Provisional IRA campaign 1969-1997|IRA campaign]]. Most of their victims were Roman Catholics with no links to the Provisional IRA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Ó Dochartaigh | first = Niall | authorlink = Toby Harnden | title = From Civil Rights To Armalites | publisher = [[Cork University Press]] | year = 1999 | page = 292 | month = | isbn = 978-1859181089}}&lt;/ref&gt; A particularly notorious group, based on the [[Shankill Road]] in the mid 1970s, became known as the [[Shankill Butchers]]. In all, over 1,500 people were killed in political violence in the city from 1969 until 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/1269206.stm |title=Sutton Index of Deaths |publisher=CAIN |accessdate=2007-09-10 | date=2001-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part of the legacy of [[the Troubles]] is that both republican and loyalist paramilitary groups in Belfast have become involved in organised crime and [[racket (crime)|racketeering]]{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}.

== Government ==
Belfast was granted [[Borough status in the United Kingdom|borough status]] by [[James I of England|James I]] in 1613 and official [[City status in the United Kingdom|city status]] by [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] in 1888.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Belfast City Hall: History and Background | publisher = Belfast City Council | url = http://www.belfastcity.gov.uk/cityhall/history.asp?menuitem=background | accessdate = 2007-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1973 it has been a [[Local Government (Boundaries) Act (Northern Ireland) 1971|local government district]] under local administration by [[Belfast City Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Local Government (Boundaries) Act (Northern Ireland) 1971 | publisher = Conflict Archive on the Internet (CAIN) | year= 2007 | url = http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/hmso/lgba1971.htm | accessdate = 2007-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Belfast is represented in both the [[British House of Commons]] and in the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]]. For elections to the [[European Parliament]], Belfast is within the [[Northern Ireland (European Parliament constituency)|Northern Ireland constituency]].

=== Local government ===
{{Details|Belfast City Council}}
[[File:997055128 c8fb27b317 b.jpg|thumb|Belfast City Hall.]]
Belfast City Council is the [[Local government in Northern Ireland|local authority]] with responsibility for the city. The city's elected officials are the [[Lord Mayor of Belfast|Lord Mayor]], Deputy Lord Mayor and [[High Sheriff]] who are elected from among 51 [[councillors]]. The first Lord Mayor of Belfast was Daniel Dixon, who was elected in 1892.&lt;ref name=&quot;Belfast City Council - Lord Mayor&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Councillors: Lord Mayor | publisher = Belfast City Council | url = http://www.belfastcity.gov.uk/councillors/index.asp?menuitem2=lord-mayor | accessdate = 2007-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of June 2009, the Lord Mayor of Belfast is [[Alliance Party of Northern Ireland|Alliance]] politician, [[Naomi Long]], who is only the second woman Lord Mayor of the city. Her duties include presiding over meetings of the council, receiving distinguished visitors to the city, and representing and promoting the city on the national and international stage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Belfast City Council - Lord Mayor&quot; /&gt; Long replaces the [[Sinn Féin]] Lord Mayor, Tom Hartley.

In 1997, [[Unionism in Ireland|Unionists]] lost overall control of Belfast City Council for the first time in its history, with the [[Alliance Party of Northern Ireland]] gaining the balance of power between [[Irish nationalism|Nationalists]] and Unionists. This position was confirmed in the three subsequent council elections, with mayors from Nationalist [[Sinn Féin]] and [[Social Democratic and Labour Party]] (SDLP), and the cross-community Alliance Party regularly elected since. The first nationalist Lord Mayor of Belfast was Alban Maginness of the SDLP, in 1996.

The [[Northern Ireland local government elections, 2011|last elections]] to Belfast City Council were held on 5 May 2011, with the City's voters electing fifty-one councillors across [[Electoral wards of Belfast|nine district electoral areas]]. The election saw Nationalist councillors outnumber Unionist councillors for the first time, with Sinn Féin becoming the largest party: 16(+2) [[Sinn Féin]], 15(-) [[Democratic Unionist Party]] (DUP), 8(-) [[Social Democratic and Labour Party|SDLP]], 6(+2) [[Alliance Party of Northern Ireland|Alliance Party]], 3(-4) [[Ulster Unionist Party]] (UUP), 2 [[Progressive Unionist Party]] (PUP), and 1 Independent (a former deputy mayor who takes the UUP whip was a member of the defunct [[Ulster loyalism|loyalist]] paramilitary linked-[[Ulster Democratic Party]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Belfast City Council Elections 1993–2005 | work = Northern Ireland Elections | publisher = Northern Ireland Social and Political Archive (ARK) | year= 2005 | url = http://www.ark.ac.uk/elections/lgbelfast.htm | accessdate = 2007-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Northern Ireland Assembly and Westminster ===
{{Details3|[[Northern Ireland Assembly]] and [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]}}
{{See also|Belfast (Northern Ireland Parliament constituencies)|Belfast (UK Parliament constituency)}}As Northern Ireland's capital city, Belfast is host to the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]] at [[Parliament Buildings (Northern Ireland)|Stormont]], the site of the [[Devolution#Northern Ireland|devolved]] legislature for Northern Ireland. Belfast is divided into four [[Northern Ireland Assembly]] and [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|UK parliamentary]] constituencies: [[Belfast North (UK Parliament constituency)|North Belfast]], [[Belfast West (UK Parliament constituency)|West Belfast]], [[Belfast South (UK Parliament constituency)|South Belfast]] and [[Belfast East (UK Parliament constituency)|East Belfast]]. All four extend beyond the city boundaries to include parts of [[Castlereagh (borough)|Castlereagh]], [[Lisburn City Council|Lisburn]] and [[Newtownabbey Borough Council|Newtownabbey]] districts. In the [[Northern Ireland Assembly ellection, 2007|Northern Ireland Assembly Elections in 2007]], Belfast elected 24 [[Members of the Legislative Assembly]] (MLAs), 6 from each [[List of Parliamentary constituencies in Northern Ireland|constituency]]. The MLA breakdown consisted of 8 [[Sinn Féin]], 6 [[Democratic Unionist Party|DUP]], 4 [[Social Democratic and Labour Party|SDLP]], 3 [[Ulster Unionist Party|UUP]], 2 [[Alliance Party of Northern Ireland|Alliance Party]], and 1 [[Progressive Unionist Party|PUP]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Northern Ireland election | publisher = BBC News | date= 2007-03-09 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/vote2007/nielection/html/main.stm | accessdate = 2007-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2005 UK general election, Belfast elected one [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|MP]] from each constituency to the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] at Westminster, [[London]]. This comprised 1 DUP, 1 SDLP, 1 Alliance and 1 [[Sinn Féin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The 2005 Westminster elections in Northern Ireland | work = Northern Ireland Elections | publisher = Northern Ireland Social and Political Archive (ARK) | year= 2005 | url = http://www.ark.ac.uk/elections/fw05.htm | accessdate = 2007-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Coat of arms and motto ===
[[File:Belfast City Coat of Arms.jpg|thumb|Belfast City Coat of Arms]]
The city of Belfast has the [[Latin]] motto &quot;{{lang|la|''Pro tanto quid retribuamus''}}.&quot; This is taken from [[Psalms|Psalm]] 116 Verse 12 in the Latin [[Vulgate|Vulgate Bible]] and is literally &quot;For (''Pro'') so much (''tanto'') what (''quid'') we shall repay (''retribuamus'')&quot; The verse has been translated in bibles differently – for example as &quot;What shall I render unto the Lord for all his benefits toward me?&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;King James Bible, Psalm 116 Verse 12&lt;/ref&gt; It is also translated as &quot;In return for so much, what shall we give back?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;I reflected on the two mottos of Belfast and America – '{{lang|la|''Pro Tanto Quid''}}' and '{{lang|la|''E Pluribus Unum''}}'. I am reliably informed that these roughly translate as 'In return for so much, what shall we give back?' and 'From many, one'.&quot; [http://www.allianceparty.org/news/000578/celebrating_diversity_by_belfast_lord_mayor_tom_ekin.html Celebrating diversity], by Belfast Lord Mayor Tom Ekin&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Queen's University Belfast|Queen's University]] Students' Union [[Rag Week]] publication ''PTQ'' derives its name from the first three words of the motto.

The [[coat of arms]] of the city are blazoned as ''Party per fesse argent and azure, in chief a pile vair and on a canton gules a bell argent, in base a ship with sails set argent on waves of the sea proper''. This heraldic language describes a shield that is divided in two horizontally (''party per fesse''). The top (''chief'') of the shield is silver (''argent''), and has a point-down triangle (''a pile'') with a repeating blue-and-white pattern that represents fur (''vair''). There is also a red square in the top corner (''a canton gules'') on which there is a silver bell. It is likely that the bell is an example here of &quot;canting&quot; (or punning) heraldry, representing the first syllable of Belfast. In the lower part of the shield (''in base'') there is a silver sailing ship shown sailing on waves colored in the actual colors of the sea (''proper''). The supporter on the &quot;dexter&quot; side (that is, the viewer's left) is a chained wolf, while on the &quot;sinister&quot; side the supporter is a sea-horse. The crest above the shield is also a sea-horse. These arms date back to 1613, when [[James I of England|King James I]] granted Belfast town status. The seal was used by Belfast merchants throughout the 17th century on their signs and trade-coins.&lt;ref name=&quot;Buildings of Belfast&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Brett | first = C. E. B. | title = Buildings of Belfast, 1700–1914 | publisher = Weidenfeld and Nicolson | year= 1967 | location = London}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large stained glass window in the [[Belfast City Hall|City Hall]] displays the arms, where an explanation suggests that the seahorse and the ship refer to Belfast's significant maritime history. The wolf may be a tribute to the city's founder, [[Arthur Chichester|Sir Arthur Chichester]], and refer to his own coat of arms.&lt;ref name=&quot;Buildings of Belfast&quot; /&gt;

== Geography ==
[[File:Cavehill, Belfast.jpg|thumb|right|[[Cavehill]], a basaltic hill overlooking the city.]]
[[File:The Lagan - geograph.org.uk - 190622.jpg|thumb|right|The [[River Lagan]] in Belfast.]]
Belfast is situated on [[Ireland]]'s eastern [[coast]] at {{Coord|54|35|49|N|05|55|45|W|}}. The city is flanked to the northwest by a series of hills, including [[Cavehill]]. Belfast is located at the western end of [[Belfast Lough]] and at the mouth of the [[River Lagan]] making it an ideal location for the shipbuilding industry that once made it famous. When the [[RMS Titanic|''Titanic'']] was built in Belfast in 1911/1912, [[Harland and Wolff]] had the largest shipyard in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;Titanic In History&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Introduction To Titanic – Titanic In History | work = Titanic.

Belfast is situated on Northern Ireland's eastern coast. A consequence of this northern latitude is that it both endures short winter days and enjoys long summer evenings. During the [[winter solstice]], the shortest day of the year, local sunset is before 16:00 while sunrise is around 08:45. This is balanced by the [[Solstice|summer solstice]] in June, when the sun sets after 22:00 and rises before 05:00.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Sunrise and sunset in Belfast | work = Sun Calculator | publisher = time and date.com | url = http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/astronomy.html?n=919| accessdate = 2007-05-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, a [[Lagan Weir|weir]] was built across the river by the [[Laganside Corporation]] to raise the average water level so that it would cover the unseemly mud flats which gave Belfast its name&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Lagan Weir – Why it exists | publisher = Laganside | url = http://www.laganside.com/laganweir.asp | accessdate = 2007-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{derive|Irish|Béal Feirste|The sandy ford at the river mouth}}).&lt;ref name=&quot;Belfast name&quot; /&gt; The area of Belfast Local Government District is {{sq mi to km2|42.3|spell=UK}}.&lt;ref name=Areameasurements&gt;{{cite web | title = Area Measurements in Northern Ireland | work = 2001 census Data | publisher = Northern Ireland Statistics &amp; Research Agency | year= 2001 | url = http://www.nisranew.nisra.gov.uk/census/area_measurement.html | accessdate = 2007-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[River Farset]] is also named after this [[silt]] deposit (from the Irish ''feirste'' meaning &quot;sand spit&quot;). Originally a more significant river than it is today, the Farset formed a dock on High Street until the mid 19th century. Bank Street in the [[Belfast City Centre|city centre]] referred to the river bank and Bridge Street was named for the site of an early Farset bridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Belfast City: Did you know? | work = Discover Ireland | publisher = Tourism Ireland | year= 2007 | url = http://www.discoverireland.com/za/ireland-places-to-go/areas-and-cities/belfast-city/highlights/culture/ | accessdate = 2007-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, superseded by the [[River Lagan]] as the more important river in the city, the Farset now languishes in obscurity, under High Street.

The city is flanked on the north and northwest by a series of hills, including [[Divis|Divis Mountain]], [[Black Mountain (Belfast)|Black Mountain]] and [[Cavehill]] thought to be the inspiration for [[Jonathan Swift]]'s ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]''. When Swift was living at Lilliput Cottage near the bottom of the Limestone Road in Belfast, he imagined that the [[Cavehill]] resembled the shape of a sleeping giant safeguarding the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jonathan Swift&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Belfast Hills | work = Discover Northern Ireland | publisher = Northern Ireland Tourist Board | url = http://www.discovernorthernireland.com/product.aspx?ProductID=10391 | accessdate = 2007-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shape of the giant's nose, known locally as ''Napoleon's Nose'', is officially called McArt's Fort probably named after Art O'Neill, a 17th century chieftain who controlled the area at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = About the Cave Hill | publisher = The Cave Hill Conservation Campaign | year= 2007 | url = http://www.cavehill.freeuk.com/home.htm | accessdate = 2007-05-25|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070206154855/http://www.cavehill.freeuk.com/home.htm |archivedate = February 6, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Castlereagh]] Hills overlook the city on the southeast.

Former poet and Catholic Bishop of Down and Connor, Dr William Philbin wrote this of Belfast: &quot;Belfast is a city walled in by mountains, moated by seas, and undermined by deposits of history&quot;.

=== Climate ===
Belfast has a [[temperate]] climate. Average daily high temperatures are 18&amp;nbsp;°C (64&amp;nbsp;°F) in July and 6&amp;nbsp;°C (43&amp;nbsp;°F) in January. The highest temperature recorded in Belfast was 30.8&amp;nbsp;°C (87.4&amp;nbsp;°F) on 12 July 1983.&lt;ref name=&quot;Met Office&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Climate: Northern Ireland | publisher = Met Office | url = http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/ni/ | accessdate = 2007-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city gets significant precipitation (greater than 0.01&amp;nbsp;in/0.25&amp;nbsp;mm) on 213 days in an average year with an average annual rainfall of {{mm to in|846|spell=UK}},&lt;ref name=&quot;Belfast Weather&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Belfast, Northern Ireland – Average Conditions | work = BBC Weather Centre | publisher = BBC | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/world/city_guides/city.shtml?tt=TT003750 | accessdate = 2009-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; less than the [[Lake District#Climate|Lake District]] or the [[Scottish Highlands]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Met Office&quot; /&gt; but higher than [[Dublin]] or the south-east coast of Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Rainfall in Ireland | publisher = Met Éireann | url = http://www.met.ie/climate/rainfall.asp | accessdate = 2007-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an urban and coastal area, Belfast typically gets snow on fewer than 10 days per year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Met Office&quot; /&gt;
The city is also renowned for how warm it can get during the winter months at its high latitude. In February, temperatures have hit 17&amp;nbsp;°C, at the same latitude where it is ~-45&amp;nbsp;°C in Russia and Canada.
It is not uncommon for temperatures in summer to reach as high as 27&amp;nbsp;°C (80&amp;nbsp;°F) on numerous days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Belfast/Harbour Climate History | work = weatheronline.co.uk | publisher = weatheronline.co.uk | url = http://weatheronline.co.uk/cgi-bin/regframe?3CODE=%26PLZN%3DBelfast%26PLZ%3DBT13&amp;LANG=en&amp;PRG=citybild | accessdate = 2008-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The consistently humid climate that prevails over Ireland can make temperatures feel uncomfortable when they stray into the high 20s (80–85&amp;nbsp;°F), more so than similar temperatures in hotter climates in the rest of Europe.

{{Main|Subdivisions of Belfast}}{{Details3|[[Transport in Belfast#City layout|Belfast City Layout]]|City Layout}}
Belfast expanded very rapidly from being a market town to becoming an industrial city during the course of the 19th century. Because of this, it is less an agglomeration of villages and towns which have expanded into each other, than other comparable cities, such as [[Manchester]] or [[Birmingham]]. The city expanded to the natural barrier of the hills that surround it, overwhelming other settlements. Consequently, the arterial roads along which this expansion took place (such as the [[Falls Road, Belfast|Falls Road]] or the [[Newtownards Road]]) are more significant in defining the districts of the city than nucleated settlements. Belfast remains segregated by walls, commonly known as &quot;[[peace lines]]&quot;, erected by the [[British Army]] after August 1969, and which still divide 14 districts in the inner city.

[[File:City Hall And The Belfast Wheel.jpg|thumb|left|Belfast City Hall and the Big Wheel at night]]
The architectural style of Belfast's buildings range from [[Edwardian Baroque architecture|Edwardian]], like the [[Belfast City Hall|City Hall]], to modern, like [[Waterfront Hall]]. Many of the city's [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] landmarks, including the main ''Lanyon Building'' at [[Queen's University Belfast]] and the [[Linenhall Library]], were designed by [[Charles Lanyon|Sir Charles Lanyon]].

The [[Belfast City Hall|City Hall]] was finished in 1906 and was built to reflect Belfast's city status, granted by [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] in 1888.

The ornately decorated [[The Crown Liquor Saloon|Crown Liquor Saloon]], designed by Joseph Anderson in 1876, in Great Victoria Street is the only bar in the UK owned by the [[List of National Trust properties in Northern Ireland|National Trust]].

=== Parks and gardens ===
{{Main|List of parks and gardens in Belfast}}
Sitting at the mouth of the gentle River Lagan where it becomes a deep and sheltered lough, Belfast is surrounded by mountains that create a special micro-climate that is conducive and beneficial to horticulture. From the Victorian idyll that is Botanic Gardens in the heart of the city to the spectacular heights of Cave Hill Country Park, the great expanse of Lagan Valley Regional Park to the tranquil beauty of Colin Glen, Belfast contains an abundance of beautiful parkland and forest parks, all of which are in close proximity to Belfast city centre.&lt;ref name=&quot;Parks and gardens&quot;&gt;{{cite news | title = Parks and gardens | publisher = gotobelfast| date= 2007-04-01 | url = http://www.gotobelfast.com/what_to_do/attractions/parks__gardens.aspx| accessdate = 2009-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parks and Gardens are an integral part of Belfast's heritage, and home to an abundance of local wildlife and popular places for a picnic, a stroll or a jog. Numerous events take place throughout including festivals such as Rose Week and special activities such as bird watching evenings and great beast hunts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Parks and gardens&quot; /&gt;

Belfast has over forty public parks. The Forest of Belfast is a partnership between government and local groups, set up in 1992 to manage and conserve the city's parks and open spaces. They have commissioned more than 30 public sculptures since 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Forest of Belfast | publisher = Belfast City Council | url = http://www.belfastcity.gov.uk/parksandopenspaces/forestofbelfast.asp?menuitem=forest | accessdate = 2007-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the [[Belfast City Council|City Council]] set aside [[Pound sterling|UK£]]8 million to continue this work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Your City, Your Space | publisher = Belfast City Council | url = http://www.belfastcity.gov.uk/parksandopenspaces/openspacestrategy.asp?menuitem=yourcity | accessdate = 2007-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Belfast Naturalists' Field Club]] was founded in 1863 and is administered by National Museums and Galleries of Northern Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;

[[Belfast Zoo]] is owned by Belfast City Council. The council spends £1.5 million every year on running and promoting the zoo, which is one of the few local government-funded zoos in the UK and Ireland. The Zoo is one of the top visitor attraction in Northern Ireland, receiving more than 295,000 visitors a year. The majority of the animals are in danger in their natural habitat. The zoo houses more than 1,200 animals of 140 species including [[Asian Elephant]]s, [[Barbary lion|Barbary Lions]], a [[White tiger|White Tigers]] (one of the few in the [[United Kingdom]]), three species of [[penguin]], a family of [[Western Lowland Gorilla]]s, a troop of [[Common Chimpanzee]]s, a [[Red Panda]] and several species of [[langur]].

Belfast experienced a huge growth in [[population]] around the first half of the twentieth century. This rise slowed and peaked around the start of [[the Troubles]] with the 1971 census showing almost 600,000 people in the ''Belfast Urban Area''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Geography in Action Urban Growth&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = Stephen | first = Roulston | title = Urban Structure: Growth of Belfast | work = Geography in Action | publisher = National Grid for Learning | year= 2006 | url = http://www.geographyinaction.co.uk/Urban_structure/Urban_growth.html | accessdate = 2007-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the inner city numbers have dropped dramatically as people have moved to swell the [[Greater Belfast]] suburb population. The 2001 census population within the same Urban Area, had fallen to 277,391&lt;ref name=&quot;Belfast Urban Area&quot; /&gt; people, with 579,554 people living in the wider [[Belfast Metropolitan Area]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Belfast Metropolitan Area&quot; /&gt; The population density in the same year was 2,415 people/km² (compared to 119 for the rest of Northern Ireland).&lt;ref name=&quot;Belfast LGD&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Local Government District Information for Belfast LGD | work = Northern Ireland Neighbourhood Information Service (NINIS) | publisher = Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency | year= 2003 | url = http://www.ninis.nisra.gov.uk/mapxtreme/report.asp?INIT=YES&amp;POSTCODE=BT015GS&amp;DESC=FromGeneral&amp;CurrentLevel=COA&amp;ID=95GG390015&amp;Name=95GG390015&amp;Tab=DC | accessdate = 2007-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with many cities, Belfast's inner city is currently characterised by the elderly, students and single young people, while families tend to live on the periphery. Socio-economic areas radiate out from the [[Belfast City Centre|Central Business District]], with a pronounced wedge of affluence extending out the [[Malone Road]] and Upper Malone Road to the south.&lt;ref name=&quot;Geography in Action Urban Growth&quot; /&gt; An area of greater deprivation extends to the west of the city.

Despite a period of relative peace, most areas and districts of Belfast still reflect the divided nature of Northern Ireland as a whole.

Segregation has been present throughout the history of Belfast, but has been maintained and increased by each outbreak of violence in the city. This escalation in segregation, described as a &quot;ratchet effect&quot;, has shown little sign of decreasing during times of peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Lloyd | first = C | title = Measuring local segregation in Northern Ireland | journal = Centre for Spatial Territorial Analysis and Research (C-STAR) | year= 2003 | publisher = School of Geography, Queen's University | url = http://www.qub.ac.uk/c-star/pubs/lloydetal.pdf | accessdate = 2006-03-12 |format=PDF}}

Belfast has been the fastest-growing economy of the thirty largest British cities over the past decade, a new economy report by Howard Spencer has found.

=== Industrial growth ===
[[File:Belfast Shipyard 1907.jpg|thumb|A 1907 [[stereoscope]] postcard depicting the construction of a liner at the [[Harland and Wolff]] shipyard.]]

The port supplied an avenue for trade with Great Britain and later Europe and North America. In the mid-17th century, Belfast exported beef, butter, hides, tallow and corn and it imported coal, cloth, wine, brandy, paper, timber and tobacco.&lt;ref name=&quot;Belfast, The Making of the City 1&quot; /&gt; Around this time, the [[linen]] trade in Northern Ireland blossomed and by the middle of the 18th century, one fifth of all the linen exported from Ireland was shipped from Belfast.&lt;ref name=&quot;Belfast, The Making of the City 1&quot; /&gt; The present city however is a product of the [[Industrial Revolution]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Columbia Encyclopedia&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title = The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition. | publisher = Columbia University Press | year= 2005 | url = http://www.bartleby.com/65/be/Belfast.html}}{{dead link|date=February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until industry transformed the linen and shipbuilding trades that the economy and the population boomed.

The effect of the economic depression in the Irish Republic on wage levels is not yet fully apparent. The cost of living in Northern Ireland is significantly lower than in the Republic and this has created a retail boom in border towns and cities.

Belfast saw the worst of [[The Troubles]] in Northern Ireland, with nearly half of the total deaths in the conflict occurring in the city. However, since the [[Belfast Agreement|Good Friday Agreement]] in 1998, there has been significant [[urban regeneration]] in the [[Belfast City Centre|city centre]] including Victoria Square, [[Titanic Quarter, Belfast|Queen's Island]] and [[Laganside]] as well as the [[Odyssey (Belfast)|Odyssey]] complex and the landmark [[Waterfront Hall]]. The city is served by two airports: The [[George Best Belfast City Airport]] adjacent to Belfast Lough and [[Belfast International Airport]] which is near [[Lough Neagh]]. [[Queen's University of Belfast]] is the main university in the city. The [[University of Ulster]] also maintains a campus in the city, which concentrates on fine art, design and architecture.

Belfast is one of the constituent cities that makes up the [[Dublin-Belfast corridor]] region, which has a population of just under 3 million.

=== Transport ===
{{Main|Transport in Belfast}}
Belfast is a relatively car-dependent city by European standards, with an extensive road network including the {{convert|22.5|mi|km|0}} [[M2 motorway (Northern Ireland)|M2]] and [[M22 motorway (Northern Ireland)|M22]] motorway route.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wesleyjohnston.com/roads/m2.html |title='&amp;#39;M2 / M22 Motorway'&amp;#39; |publisher=Wesleyjohnston.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; A recent survey of how people travel in Northern Ireland showed that people in Belfast made 77% of all journeys by car, 11% by public transport and 6% on foot.&lt;ref name=&quot;Travel Survey&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency | title = Travel Survey for Northern Ireland 2002–04 | publisher = Department for Regional Development | date = 2005-10-18 | url = http://www.drdni.gov.uk/statistic-details.htm?publication_id=161 | format = PDF | accessdate = 2007-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also showed that Belfast has 0.70 cars per household compared to figures of 1.18 in the East and 1.14 in the West of Northern Ireland.&lt;ref name=&quot;Travel Survey&quot; /&gt; A significant road improvement-scheme in Belfast began early in 2006, with the upgrading of two junctions along the [[Westlink Belfast|Westlink]] dual-carriageway to [[grade separation|grade-separated]] standard. The improvement scheme was completed five months ahead of schedule on February 2009, with the official opening taking place on 4 March 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drdni.gov.uk/index/publications/publications-details.htm?docid=5070|title=The Official Opening of the M1/Westlink Improvement Scheme |publisher=The Department for Regional Development|date=2009-03-12 |accessdate=2011-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commentators have argued that this may simply create a bottleneck at York Street, the next [[at-grade intersection]], until that too is upgraded. The York Street phase is currently at the review stage and if successfully completing the necessary statutory procedures, work on a grade separated junction to connect the Westlink to the M2/M3 motorways is scheduled to take place between 2013/14 to 2017/2018,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://roadimprovements.roadsni.gov.uk/index/schemes/york_street_interchange-7.htm |title=Scheduled work on Westlink to M2/M3 Junction |publisher=Roadimprovements.roadsni.gov.uk |date=2009-11-26 |accessdate=2010-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; creating a continuous link between the M1 and M2, the two main motorways in Northern Ireland.

[[Hackney carriage|Black taxis]] are common in the city, operating on a [[Share taxi|share]] basis in some areas. These, however, are outnumbered by [[Taxicabs of the United Kingdom#Private hire ('minicabs')|private hire taxis]]. Bus and rail [[public transport]] in Northern Ireland is operated by subsidiaries of [[Translink (Northern Ireland)|Translink]]. Bus services in the city proper and the nearer suburbs are operated by [[Metro (Belfast)|Translink Metro]], with services focusing on linking residential districts with the city centre on 12 [[quality bus corridor]]s running along main radial roads, resulting in poor connections between different suburban areas{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}. More distant suburbs are served by [[Ulsterbus]]. [[Northern Ireland Railways]] provides [[Belfast Suburban Rail|suburban services]] along three lines running through Belfast's northern suburbs to [[Carrickfergus]] and [[Larne]], eastwards towards [[Bangor, County Down|Bangor]] and south-westwards towards [[Lisburn]] and [[Portadown]]. This service is known as the [[Belfast Suburban Rail]] system. Belfast also has a direct rail connection with [[Dublin]] called ''[[Enterprise (train)|Enterprise]]'' which is operated jointly by NIR and [[Iarnród Éireann]], the state railway company of the [[Republic of Ireland]].

In April 2008, the [[Department for Regional Development]] reported on a plan for a light-rail system, similar to that in[[Dublin|Dublin.]] The consultants said Belfast does not have the population to support a light rail system, suggesting that investment in bus-based rapid transit would be preferable.The study found that bus-based rapid transit produces positive economic results, but light rail does not.

== Culture ==
{{Main|Culture of Belfast}}

Belfast's population is evenly split between its [[Protestantism|Protestant]] and [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] residents.&lt;ref name=&quot;Belfast Urban Area&quot; /&gt; These two distinct cultural communities have both contributed significantly to the city's culture. Throughout [[the Troubles]], Belfast artists continued to express themselves through poetry, art and music. In the period since the [[Belfast Agreement|Good Friday Agreement]] in 1998, Belfast has begun a social, economic and cultural transformation giving it a growing international cultural reputation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Summary of the bid | work = One Belfast Where Hope and History Rhyme (Internet Archive) | publisher = Imagine Belfast 2008 | date= 2002-11-22 | url = http://web.archive.org/web/20021207124752/www.imaginebelfast2008.com/front.html | accessdate = 2007-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, Belfast had an unsuccessful bid for the 2008 [[European Capital of Culture]]. The bid was run by an independent company, ''Imagine Belfast'', who boasted that it would &quot;make Belfast the meeting place of Europe's legends, where the meaning of history and belief find a home and a sanctuary from caricature, parody and oblivion.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = The official websites on UK bids for European capital of culture 2008 | publisher = The Guardian | date= 2002-10-30 | url = http://society.guardian.co.uk/regeneration/page/0,,774007,00.html | accessdate = 2007-03-13 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[The Guardian]]'' the bid may have been undermined by the [[History of Belfast|city's history]] and volatile politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Ward | first = D | coauthors = Carter, H | title = Six cities shortlisted for culture capital bid | publisher = The Guardian | date= 2002-10-31 | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,,822886,00.html | accessdate = 2007-03-13 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004–05, art and cultural events in Belfast were attended by 1.8 million people (400,000 more than the previous year). The same year, 80,000 people participated in culture and arts activities, twice as many as in 2003–04.&lt;ref name=&quot;Belfast Cultural Strategy&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Integrated Cultural Strategy for Belfast | publisher = Capital City: Belfast City Councils Development Agenda | date= 2006-05 | url = http://www.belfastcity.gov.uk/culture/culturalstrategy.asp | format = PDF | accessdate = 2007-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; A combination of relative peace, international investment and an active promotion of arts and culture is attracting more tourists to Belfast than ever before. In 2004–05, 5.9 million people visited Belfast, a 10% increase from the previous year, and spent [[Pound sterling|UK£]]262.5 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;Belfast Cultural Strategy&quot; /&gt;

The [[Ulster Orchestra]], based in Belfast, is Northern Ireland's only full-time [[symphony orchestra]] and is well renowned in the United Kingdom. Founded in 1966, it has existed in its present form since 1981, when the [[BBC Northern Ireland]] Orchestra was disbanded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Welcome to the new season | publisher = Ulster Orchestra Society | url = http://www.ulster-orchestra.org.uk/concerts/welcome.html | accessdate = 2007-05-24|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070205212256/http://www.ulster-orchestra.org.uk/concerts/welcome.html |archivedate = February 5, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The music school of Queen's University is responsible for arranging a notable series of lunchtime and evening concerts, often given by renowned musicians which are usually given in The Harty Room at the university (University Square).

There are many Traditional Irish bands playing throughout the city and quite a few music schools concentrate on teaching Traditional music. Well known city centre venues would include Kelly's Cellars, Maddens and the Hercules bar. Famous artists would include The McPeakes, Brian Kennedy and the band [[9Lies]].

Musicians and bands who have written songs about or dedicated to Belfast:
[[U2]], [[Van Morrison]], [[Snow Patrol]], [[Simple Minds]], [[Elton John]], [[Katie Melua]], [[Boney M]], [[Paul Muldoon]], [[Stiff Little Fingers]], [[Nanci Griffith]], [[Glenn Patterson]], [[Orbital (band)|Orbital]], [[James Taylor]], [[Spandau Ballet]], [[The Police]], [[Barnbrack]], [[Gary Moore]] [[Neon Neon]].

Further in Belfast the [[Oh Yeah (music centre)|Oh Yeah]] Music Centre is located (Cathedral Quarter), a project founded to give young musicians and artists a place where they can share ideas and kick-start their music careers as chance to been supported and promoted by professional musicians of Northern Ireland's music-scene.

Like all areas of the island of Ireland outside of the [[Gaeltacht]], the Irish language in Belfast is not that of an unbroken intergenerational tramsmission. Due to community activity in the 1960s, including the establishment of the Shaws Road Gaeltacht community, the expanse in the Irish language arts, and the advancements made in the availability of Irish medium education throughout the city, it can now be said that there is a 'mother-tongue' community of speakers{{Dubious|date=November 2010}}. The language is heavily promoted in the city and Belfast has the highest concentration of Irish speakers in Northern Ireland{{Reference necessary|date=November 2010}}. Projects to promote the language in the city are funded by various sources, notably [[Foras na Gaeilge]], an all-Ireland body funded by both the Irish and British governments. There are a number Irish language Primary schools and one secondary school in Belfast. The provision of certain resources for these schools (for example, such as the provision of textbooks) is supported by the charitable organisation TACA.

'''Biotite''' is a common [[Silicate minerals#Phyllosilicates|phyllosilicate]] [[mineral]] within the [[mica]] group, with the approximate chemical formula {{chem|K(Mg,Fe)|3|AlSi|3|O|10|(F,OH)|2}}. More generally, it refers to the dark mica series, primarily a solid-solution series between the iron-endmember [[annite]],  and the magnesium-endmember [[phlogopite]]; more aluminous endmembers include [[siderophyllite]].  Biotite was named by [[Johann Friedrich Ludwig Hausmann|J.F.L. Hausmann]] in 1847 in honour of the French [[physicist]] [[Jean-Baptiste Biot]], who, in 1816, researched the optical properties of [[mica]], discovering many unique properties.

Biotite is a sheet [[silicate]]. Iron, magnesium, aluminium, silicon, oxygen, and hydrogen form sheets that are weakly bond together by potassium ions. It is sometimes called &quot;iron mica&quot; because it is more iron-rich than phlogopite. It is also sometimes called &quot;black mica&quot; as opposed to &quot;white mica&quot; ([[muscovite]]) – both form in some rocks, in some instances side-by-side.

==Properties==
Like other [[mica]] minerals, biotite has a highly perfect [[basal cleavage]], and consists of flexible sheets, or [[Lamellae (materials)|lamellae]], which easily flake off.  It has a [[monoclinic crystal system]], with [[tabular]] to [[Prism (geometry)|prismatic]] crystals with an obvious [[pinacoid]] [[termination]].  It has four prism faces and two pinacoid faces to form a [[pseudohexagonal]] crystal.  Although not easily seen because of the cleavage and sheets, fracture is uneven. It appears greenish to brown or black, and even yellow when weathered. It can be transparent to opaque, has a vitreous to pearly luster, and a grey-white streak. When biotite is found in large chunks, they are called “books” because it resembles a book with pages of many sheets.

Under cross polarized light biotite can generally be identified by the gnarled [[Bird's eye maple (mineral property)|bird's eye extinction]].

==Occurrence==
Biotite is found in a wide variety of [[igneous rock|igneous]] and [[metamorphic rocks]]. For instance, biotite occurs in the [[lava]] of [[Mount Vesuvius]] and in the Monzoni intrusive complex of the western [[Dolomites]].  It is an essential [[phenocryst]] in some varieties of [[lamprophyre]]. Biotite is occasionally found in large cleavable crystals, especially in [[pegmatite]] veins, as in [[New England]], [[Virginia]] and [[North Carolina]]. Other notable occurrences include [[Bancroft, Ontario|Bancroft]] and [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]], Ontario. It is an essential constituent of many metamorphic [[schist]]s, and it forms in suitable compositions over a wide range of pressure and temperature. 

The largest documented single crystals of biotite were approximately {{convert|7|m2|abbr=on}} sheets found in [[Iveland]], Norway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url = http://www.minsocam.org/ammin/AM66/AM66_885.pdf| journal = American Mineralogist| volume = 66| pages = 885–907| year= 1981| title= The largest crystals| author = P. C. Rickwood}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
[[Image:MeroxeneSomma.png|thumb|left|biotite: Topotype deposit]]
Biotite is used extensively to constrain ages of rocks, by either [[potassium-argon dating]] or [[argon-argon dating]]. Because argon escapes readily from the biotite crystal structure at high temperatures, these methods may provide only minimum ages for many rocks. Biotite is also useful in assessing temperature histories of metamorphic rocks, because the partitioning of [[iron]] and [[magnesium]] between biotite and [[garnet]] is sensitive to temperature.

'''Brigham Young''' ({{IPA-en|ˈbrɪɡəm|pron}}; June 1, 1801&amp;nbsp;– August 29, 1877) was an American leader in the [[Latter Day Saint movement]] and a [[settler]] of the [[western United States]]. He was the [[President of the Church|President]] of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) from 1847 until his death in 1877. He was also the founder of [[Salt Lake City]] and the first [[Governor of Utah|governor]] of [[Utah Territory]], [[United States]]. [[Brigham Young University]] was named in his honor.

Young had a variety of nicknames, among the most popular being &quot;American [[Moses]],&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lds.org/newsroom/showpackage/0%2C15367%2C3899-31--34-2-190%2C00.html Newsroom&amp;nbsp;— The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; (alternatively the &quot;Modern Moses&quot; or the &quot;Mormon Moses&quot;)&lt;ref&gt;[http://overlandtrails.byu.edu/mapsessay.html Trails of Hope: Overland Diaries and Letters, 1846–1869 - Maps: Their Use by Overlanders&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; because, like the [[Bible|Biblical]] figure, Young led his followers, the [[Mormon pioneers]], in an [[Emigration|exodus]] through a [[desert]], to what they saw as a promised land. Young was dubbed by his followers the &quot;Lion of the Lord&quot; for his bold personality, and was also commonly called &quot;Brother Brigham&quot; by [[Latter-day Saint]]s. Young was a [[Polygamy and the Latter Day Saint movement|polygamist]] and was involved in controversies regarding [[Black people and the Latter Day Saint movement|black people and the Priesthood]], the [[Utah War]], and the [[Mountain Meadows massacre]].

==Early life until Joseph Smith's successor==
Young was born to a farming family in [[Whitingham]], [[Vermont]] and worked as a travelling [[carpenter]] and [[blacksmith]], among other trades.&lt;ref&gt;Sheret, John G.: [http://crookedlakereview.com/articles/136_167/141fall2006winter2007/141sheret.html Brigham Young: Carpenter and Cabinet Maker]&lt;/ref&gt; Young first married in 1824 to Miriam Angeline Works. Though he had converted to the [[Methodist]] faith in 1823, Young was drawn to [[Mormonism]] after reading the ''[[Book of Mormon]]'' shortly after its publication in 1830. He officially joined the new church in 1832 and traveled to [[Upper Canada]] as a [[Mormon missionary|missionary]]. After his first wife died in 1832, Young joined many Mormons in establishing a community in [[Kirtland, Ohio|Kirtland]], [[Ohio]]. Young was ordained a member of the original [[Quorum of the Twelve Apostles]] in 1835, and he assumed a leadership role within that organization in taking Mormonism to the United Kingdom and organizing the exodus of Latter Day Saints from Missouri in 1838.

While in jail awaiting trial for alleged treason charges, [[Joseph Smith, Jr.|Joseph Smith]], [[President of the Church|president of the church]], was [[Death of Joseph Smith, Jr.|killed by an armed mob]] in 1844. Several claimants to the role of church President emerged during the [[succession crisis]] that ensued. Before a large meeting convened to discuss the succession in [[Nauvoo, Illinois]], [[Sidney Rigdon]], the senior surviving member of the church's [[First Presidency]], argued there could be no successor to the deceased prophet and that he should be made the &quot;Protector&quot; of the church.&lt;ref&gt;[[B. H. Roberts|Roberts, B. H.]] (ed.) ''[[History of the Church]]'', vol. 7, ch. XVIII.&lt;/ref&gt; Young opposed this reasoning and motion. Smith had earlier recorded a [[revelation]] which stated the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles were &quot;equal in authority and power&quot; to the First Presidency,&lt;ref&gt;[[Doctrine and Covenants]] [http://scriptures.lds.org/en/dc/107/23-24#23 107:23-24].&lt;/ref&gt; so Young claimed that the leadership of the church fell to the Twelve Apostles.&lt;ref&gt;[[B. H. Roberts|Roberts, B. H.]] (ed.) ''[[History of the Church]]'', vol. 7, ch. XIX.&lt;/ref&gt; According to later reminiscences of those present at the meeting, Young appeared to be transfigured into the form and the stature of Smith, who was much taller, and some reported that Young's voice began to resemble Smith's; to many of Young's followers, this was later referred to as a sign from God that the prophetic mantle of Smith had fallen on Young as he spoke to the congregation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Quinn |first= D.

However, historians have come to different conclusions on whether the occurrence of such events is supported by contemporary records. Van Wagoner observed of contemporary accounts that &quot;none of these references an explicit transfiguration, a physical metamorphosis of Brigham Young into the form and voice of Joseph Smith,&quot; and &quot;[w]hen 8 August 1844 is stripped of emotional overlay, there is not a shred of irrefutable contemporary evidence to support the occurrence of a mystical event either in the morning or afternoon gatherings of that day.&quot;: {{cite journal |last= Van Wagoner |first= Richard S. |year= 1995 |month= Winter |title= The Making of a Mormon Myth: The 1844 Transfiguration of Brigham Young |journal= Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought |volume= 28 |issue= 4 |pages= 1-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; These recollections indicate an experience of some kind that persuaded them that the Quorum of the Twevle Apostles was to lead the church with Young as the Quorum's [[President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles|President]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jorgenson |first=Lynne W. |year= 1996-97 |title= The Mantle of the Prophet Joseph Passes to Brother Brigham: A Collective Spiritual Witness |journal= BYU Studies |volume= 36 |issue= 4 |pages= 125-204 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Arrington |first=Leonard J. |title=Brigham Young: American Moses |publisher=University of Illinois Press |pages=114-115 |year=1986 |isbn=0252012968}}&lt;/ref&gt; Young was ordained President of the Church in December 1847, more than two and a half years after Smith's death. Rigdon became the president of a separate [[Rigdonite|church organization]] based in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]] and other potential successors emerged to lead what became other denominations of the movement.

==Governor of Utah Territory==
As colonizer and founder of [[Salt Lake City]], Young was appointed the territory's first governor and superintendent of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indian]] affairs by [[Millard Fillmore|President Millard Fillmore]]. During his time as governor, Young directed the establishment of settlements throughout Utah, Idaho, Arizona, Nevada, and parts of southern Colorado and northern Mexico. Under his direction the pioneers built roads and bridges, forts, irrigation projects, and established public welfare, organized a militia, and ''[[Peace|pacified]]'' the Native Americans. Young organized the first legislature and established Fillmore as the territory's first capital. In 1856 he organized an efficient mail service. In 1858 he stepped down to his successor [[Alfred Cumming]].

==Church Presidency==
Brigham Young was the longest serving President of the LDS Church in history, having served for 29 years.

===Initial actions as church president===
After three years of leading the church as the President of the Quorum of the Twelve, in 1847 Young reorganized a new [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]] and was declared president of the church on December 27, 1847. Repeated conflict led Young to relocate his group of Latter-day Saints to a territory in what is now [[Utah]], then part of [[Mexico]]. Young organized the journey that would take the faithful to [[Winter Quarters, Nebraska]], in 1846 , then to the [[Salt Lake Valley]]. Young arrived in the Salt Lake Valley on July 24, 1847, a date now recognized as [[Pioneer Day (Utah)|Pioneer Day]] in Utah.

===Polygamy===
{{Main|Origin of Latter Day Saint polygamy#The 1850s: Official sanction of polygamy in the LDS Church}}
{{LDSpolygamy}}
The LDS Church under Brigham Young is perhaps best known for its practice of [[polygamy]]. Most historians think (and have documented) that polygamy among [[Latter Day Saints]] was taught and practiced by [[Joseph Smith]], Young's predecessor. Adherents to some other Latter Day Saint denominations believe that polygamy originated under Brigham Young's leadership of the church.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Richard and Pamela Price, ''Joseph Smith Fought Polygamy: How Men Nearest the Prophet Attached Polygamy to His Name in Order to Justify Their Own Polygamous Crimes'' (Precision Publishing, 2000), [http://restorationbookstore.org/articles/nopoligamy/jsfp-vol1/chp4.htm vol. 1, ch.3: &quot;Brigham Young: The Father of Mormon Polygamy&quot;]. The book was written by members the [[Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints]].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1853, Young made the church's first official statement on the subject after the church had arrived in Utah. He spoke about the issue nine years after the purported original revelation of Joseph Smith, and five years after the [[Mormon Exodus]] to [[Utah]] following Smith's death in [[Nauvoo, Illinois|Illinois]].

===Family life===
{{See also|List of Brigham Young's wives}}
[[Image:In memoriam brigham young 2.jpg|thumb|left|Caricature of [[Mormon]] leader Brigham Young's wives]]
Young was a [[Polygamy#Mormon Polygamy|polygamist]], marrying a total of 55 wives, 54 of them after he converted to become a Latter Day Saint.&lt;ref name = &quot;joj&quot;&gt;Jeffrey Odgen Johnson, [http://content.lib.utah.edu/u?/dialogue,17879 “Determining and Defining ‘Wife’&amp;nbsp;— The Brigham Young Households”], ''[[Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought]]'', vol. 20, no. 3 (Fall 1987), pp. 57-70.&lt;/ref&gt; The policy was difficult for many in the church. Young stated that upon being taught about [[plural marriage]], &quot;It was the first time in my life that I desired the grave.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.pbs.org/mormons/peopleevents/e_polygamy.html|title = Polygamy and the Church: A History|accessdate = 2007-05-29|date = 2007-04-30|work = The Mormons: People &amp; Events|publisher = [[WGBH Educational Foundation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time of his death, Young had 56 children by 16 of his wives; 46 of his children reached adulthood.&lt;ref name = byubio&gt;{{cite web|url = http://unicomm.byu.edu/about/brigham.aspx?|title = Brigham Young Biography|accessdate = 2010-10-04|publisher = [[Brigham Young University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sources have varied on the number of Young's wives, due to differences in what scholars have considered to be a &quot;wife&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;joj&quot;/&gt; There were 55 women that Young was [[Sealing (Latter Day Saints)|sealed]] to during his lifetime. While the majority of the sealings were [[Celestial marriage|&quot;for eternity&quot;]], some were &quot;for time only&quot;. Researchers believe that not all of the 55 marriages were [[Marriage#Rights_and_obligations|conjugal]].&lt;ref name = &quot;joj&quot;/&gt; Young did not live with a number of his wives or publicly hold them out as wives, which has led to confusion on the number and identities.&lt;ref name = &quot;joj&quot;/&gt; This is in part due to the complexity of how wives were identified in the Mormon society at the time. If a woman was married and her husband died, she often married another man in proxy of her former husband. All of her resulting children were considered fathered by her late husband. For a time women had themselves &quot;sealed&quot; to men without the men knowing about it.

Of Young's 55 wives, 21 had never been married before; 16 were widows; six were divorced; six had living husbands; and the marital status of six others are unknown.&lt;ref name = &quot;joj&quot;/&gt;

In 1856, Young built the [[Lion House (Salt Lake City, Utah)|Lion House]] to accommodate his sizable family. This building remains a Salt Lake City landmark, together with the [[Beehive House]], another Brigham Young family home. A contemporary of Young wrote: &quot;It was amusing to walk by Brigham Young's big house, a long rambling building with innumerable doors. Each wife has an establishment of her own, consisting of parlor, bedroom, and a front door, the key of which she keeps in her pocket.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = DeHegermann-Lindencrone |first = Lillie |title = The Sunny Side of Diplomatic Life, 1875–1912 |url = http://www.gutenberg.org/files/13955/13955-h/13955-h.htm |publisher = Project Gutenberg |accessdate = 2006-07-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of Young's death, 19 of his wives had predeceased him, he was divorced from ten, and 23 survived him. The status of four was unknown.&lt;ref name = &quot;joj&quot;/&gt; In his [[will (law)|will]], Young shared his estate with the 16 surviving wives who had lived with him; the six surviving non-conjugal wives were not mentioned in the will.&lt;ref name = &quot;joj&quot;/&gt;

===Circumstances leading to banning the priesthood from black members===
{{Main|Black people and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Black people and the Latter Day Saint movement}}
{{See also|Walker Lewis|Elijah Abel|William McCary}}
Brigham Young is generally credited with having been responsible for revoking the priesthood and temple blessings from black members of the LDS Church, who had been treated equally in this respect under Joseph Smith's presidency.&lt;ref name=Bush&gt;{{cite book | last = Bush, Jr | first = Lester E | coauthors = Armand L. Mauss | title = Neither White nor Black: Mormon Scholars Confront the Race Issue in a Universal Church | publisher = Signature Books | year = 1984 | location = Midvale, Utah | pages = 54–65, 70 | url = http://www.signaturebookslibrary.org/neither/neither3.htm#Chapter3 | isbn = 978-0941214223 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Mormon flight from Illinois towards Utah in 1847, Brigham Young received a letter informing him of an [[inter-racial]] marriage by the son of a prominent black member, [[Walker Lewis]]. The letter was written by William Ivers Appleby, a Mormon elder, who desired to know if interracial marriage was an acceptable practice. Appleby sent the letter to Young at Winter Quarters, Nebraska, but Young was actually in Utah, and therefore did not receive Appleby's missive until December 1, 1847, when he returned to Winter Quarters. Quite coincidentally, Appleby himself arrived in Winter Quarters on December 2. Young read Appleby's letter and then had him personally report to Young and the eight apostles who were then in Nebraska.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Lewis | first = Elder Q. Walker  | authorlink =   | title = An example for his more whiter brethren to follow | journal = John Whitmer Historical Association Journal | year = 2006 | url = http://people.ucsc.edu/~odonovan/elder_walker_lewis.html#_ftnref110 | accessdate = }} Information obtain threw a letter in the LDS Church Archives titled “William I. Appleby to Brigham Young”, May 31, 1847&lt;/ref&gt; In 1863, Young reported that he said, &quot;Shall I tell you the law of God in regard to the African race? If the white man who belongs to the chosen seed mixes his blood with the seed of Cain, the penalty, under the law of God, is [[death on the spot]]. This will always be so&quot; (''Journal of Discourses'', vol. 10, p.&amp;nbsp;110).&lt;ref&gt;[http://patriot.lib.byu.edu/cgi-bin/showfile.exe?CISOROOT=/JournalOfDiscourses3&amp;CISOPTR=4266&amp;filename=100504_171800_ep110_Va_M230_J82_v10.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

After settling in Utah in 1848, Brigham Young announced a priesthood ban which prohibited all men of black African descent from holding the priesthood.&lt;ref name=Bush/&gt; In connection, Mormons of African descent could not participate in Mormon temple rites such as the [[Endowment (Latter Day Saints)|Endowment]] or [[sealing (Latter Day Saints)|sealing]]. These racial restrictions remained in place until 1978, when the policy was rescinded by [[President of the Church]] [[Spencer W. Kimball]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://scriptures.lds.org/od/2]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conflict with U.S. government===
Shortly after the arrival of Young's pioneers, the new Mormon colonies were incorporated into the [[United States]] through [[Mexican Cession]], Young petitioned the [[U.S. Congress]] to create the [[State of Deseret]]. The [[Compromise of 1850]] instead carved out [[Utah Territory]], and Young was installed as governor. As governor and church president, Young directed both religious and economic matters. He encouraged independence and self-sufficiency. Many cities and towns in Utah, and some in neighboring states, were founded under Young's direction. Young's leadership style has been viewed as autocratic.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761555412/Brigham_Young.html Brigham Young]&quot;, MSN Encarta. [http://www.webcitation.org/query?id=1257013355527844 Archived] 2009-10-31.&lt;/ref&gt;

When federal officials received reports of widespread and systematic obstruction of federal officials in Utah (most notably judges), [[U.S. President]] [[James Buchanan]] decided to install a non-Mormon governor. Buchanan accepted the reports of the judges without any further investigation, and the new non-sectarian governor was accompanied by troops sent to garrison forts in the new territory. The troops passed by the [[Bleeding Kansas|bloody Kansas–Missouri war]] without intervening in it, as it was not open warfare and only isolated sporadic incidents. When Young received word that federal troops were headed to Utah with his replacement, he called out his militia to ambush the federal column. During the defense of Deseret, now called the [[Utah War]], Young held the [[U.S. Army]] at bay for a winter by taking their cattle and burning supply wagons. The Mormon forces were largely successful thanks to [[Lot Smith]]. Young made plans to burn [[Salt Lake City]] and move his followers to Mexico, but at the last minute he relented and agreed to step down as governor. He later received a [[pardon]] from Buchanan. Relations between Young and future governors and U.S. Presidents were mixed.

===Mountain Meadows massacre===
[[File:BrighamYoung statue.JPG|thumb|left|Statue of Young overlooking [[Brigham Young University]]]]
A controversial issue is the extent of Young's involvement in the [[Mountain Meadows massacre]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first = Emily |last = Eakin |title = Reopening a Mormon Murder Mystery; New Accusations That Brigham Young Himself Ordered an 1857 Massacre of Pioneers |url = http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10E17F6395E0C718DDDA90994DA404482&amp;showabstract=1 |work = [[New York Times]] |date = 2002-10-12 |edition = Late Edition-Final |page = Section B, Page 9, Column 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; which took place in [[Washington County, Utah|Washington County]] in 1857. [[Leonard J. Arrington]] reports that Brigham Young received a rider at his office on the same day. When he learned what was contemplated by the members of the LDS Church in Parowan and Cedar City, he sent back a letter that the Fancher party be allowed to pass through the territory unmolested.&lt;ref&gt;Brigham Young to Isaac C. Haight, Sept. 10, 1857, Letterpress Copybook 3:827–28, Brigham Young Office Files, LDS Church Archives&lt;/ref&gt; Young's letter supposedly arrived two days too late, on September 13, 1857. As governor, Young had promised the federal government he would protect immigrants passing through Utah Territory. But he had also allegedly told local Native American leaders that they had his permission to steal cattle from these wagon trains.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} Over 120 men, women and children were killed by the Mormons and their Native American allies. It is clear that local Mormons were the principal perpetrators. United States Army officer [[James Henry Carleton]] was sent to investigate the massacre and was convinced that the Mormons were the perpetrators. Only children survived, the murdered members of the wagon train (known as the [[Fancher Party]]) were left unburied, and the surviving children were cared for by local Mormon families. The remains of about forty people were found and buried and Carleton had a large cross made from local trees, the transverse beam bearing the engraving, &quot;Vengeance Is Mine, Saith The Lord: I Will Repay&quot; and erected a cairn of rocks at the site. A large slab of granite was put up on which he had the following words engraved: &quot;HERE 120 MEN, WOMEN AND CHILDREN WERE MASSACRED IN COLD BLOOD EARLY IN SEPTEMBER, 1857. THEY WERE FROM ARKANSAS.&quot; For two years the monument stood as a warning to those travelling the [[Old Spanish Trail (trade route)|Spanish Trail]] through Mountain Meadow. Some claim that, In 1861, Young brought an entourage to Mountain Meadows and had the cairn and cross destroyed, while exclaiming, &quot;Vengeance is mine and I have taken a little&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Sally Denton (2003). ''American Massacre: The Tragedy at Mountain Meadows, September 1857'' (New York: [[Vintage Books]], ISBN 0375726365) p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other notable actions===
Young organized the [[Mormon Tabernacle Choir]] and in 1850 founded the [[University of Deseret]], which is now the [[University of Utah]]. In 1875, just two years before his death, he founded Brigham Young Academy, which later became [[Brigham Young University]]. In 1950, the state of Utah donated a marble statue of Young to the [[National Statuary Hall Collection]] at the [[United States Capitol]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aoc.gov/cc/art/nsh/young.cfm Brigham Young&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===
Before his death in Salt Lake City at 4:00pm on August 29, 1877,&lt;ref&gt;[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9D06E5D7133FE63BBC4850DFBE66838C669FDE &quot;Death of Brigham Young&quot;], ''[[The New York Times]]'', August 30, 1877.&lt;/ref&gt; Young was suffering from &quot;cholera morbus and inflammation of the bowels&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9501E6D7133FE63BBC4151DFBE66838C669FDE &quot;Brigham Young's Health&quot;], ''[[The New York Times]]'', August 29, 1877.&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that he died of [[peritonitis]] from a ruptured [[Vermiform appendix|appendix]].&lt;ref name = byubio/&gt; His last words were &quot;Joseph, Joseph...&quot; upon anticipation of being reunited with his predecessor, [[Joseph Smith]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} On September 2, 1877, Young's funeral was held in the [[Salt Lake Tabernacle|Tabernacle]] with an estimated 12,000 to 15,000 people in attendance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9803EFD7133FE63BBC4B53DFBF66838C669FDE &quot;Brigham Young's Funeral&quot;], ''[[The New York Times]]'', September 3, 1877.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reference in literature==
[[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]] based his first [[Sherlock Holmes]] [[novel]], ''[[A Study in Scarlet]]'', on Mormon history, mentioning Young by name. When asked to comment on the story, which had &quot;provoked the animosity of the Mormon faithful&quot;, Conan Doyle noted, &quot;all I said about the [[Danite Band]] and the murders is historical so I cannot withdraw that though it is likely that in a work of fiction it is stated more luridly than in a work of history.&quot; However, Doyle's daughter stated that &quot;You know father would be the first to admit that his first Sherlock Holmes novel was full of errors about the Mormons.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adherents.com/lit/article_Doyle.html Sherlock Holmes creator Arthur Conan Doyle impressed by Mormons&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Florence Claxton]]'s graphic novel ''The Adventures of a Woman in Search of her Rights'' (1872), satirises a would-be emancipated woman whose failure to establish an independent career results in her marriage to Brigham Young before she wakes to discover she's been dreaming.

Mark Twain devoted a chapter and much of an appendix to Brigham Young in his book ''[[Roughing It]]''.

[[File:Robert burns.jpg|thumb|right|[[Robert Burns]] (1759–1796)]]
A '''Burns supper''' is a celebration of the life and [[poetry]] of the poet [[Robert Burns]], author of many [[Scots language|Scots]] poems. The suppers are normally held on or near the poet's birthday, 25 January, sometimes also known as '''Robert Burns Day''' or '''Burns Night''' ('''''Burns Nicht'''''), although they may in principle be held at any time of the year.  

Burns suppers are most common in [[Scotland]] and [[Northern Ireland]], but occur wherever there are [[Robert Burns|Burns]] [[Club]]s, Scottish Societies, expatriate Scots, or aficionados of Burns' poetry. There is a particularly strong tradition of them in southern [[New Zealand]]'s main city [[Dunedin]], of which Burns' nephew [[Thomas Burns (New Zealand)|Thomas Burns]] was a founding father.

The first suppers were held in [[Ayrshire]] at the end of the 18th century by Robert Burns' friends on the anniversary of his death, 21 July, ''In Memoriam'' and they have been a regular occurrence ever since. The first Burns club, known as [[The Mother Club]], was founded in [[Greenock]] in 1801 by merchants born in [[Ayrshire]], some of whom had known Burns. They held the first Burns supper on what they thought was his birthday on 29 January 1802, but in 1803 discovered from the Ayr parish records that the correct date was 25 January 1759,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldburnsclub.com/newsletter/0107/greenock_burns_club.htm |title=Congratulation Greenock Burns Club |date= |work= |publisher=The Robert Burns World Federation Limited |accessdate=2010-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and since then suppers have been held to 25 January, Burns' birthday.

Burns suppers may be either formal or informal. Informal suppers typically include [[haggis]] (a traditional Scottish dish), [[Scotch whisky]] and the recitation of Burns' poetry.  Formal dinners are hosted by organisations such as Burns clubs, the [[Freemason]]s or [[St. Andrew|St Andrews]] Societies and occasionally end with dancing when ladies are present. However whether they are single sex or not, the formal suppers follow a standard format which is as follows.

== Order of the supper ==
=== Start of the evening ===
Guests gather and mix as in any informal party.

=== Host's welcoming speech ===
&lt;div id=&quot;The Selkirk Grace&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
The host says a few words welcoming everyone to the supper and perhaps stating the reason for it.  The event is declared open.

All of the guests are seated and [[Grace (prayer)|grace]] is said, usually using the ''Selkirk Grace.'' The Selkirk Grace is a well-known thanksgiving said before meals, using the [[Modern Scots|Scots]] language. Although attributed to Burns, the Selkirk Grace was already known in the 17th century, as the &quot;[[Galloway]] Grace&quot; or the &quot;[[Covenanters]]' Grace&quot;. It came to be called the Selkirk Grace because Burns was said to have delivered it at a dinner given by the [[Dunbar Douglas, 4th Earl of Selkirk|Earl of Selkirk]].

'''The Selkirk Grace'''
:Some hae meat and canna eat,
:And some wad eat that want it;
:But we hae meat, and we can eat,
:And sae let the Lord be thankit.

The supper then starts with the soup course.  Normally a Scottish soup such as [[Scotch Broth]], Potato Soup or [[Cock-a-leekie soup|Cock-a-Leekie]] is served.

=== Entrance of the haggis ===
[[Image:BobPurdieAddressingHaggis20040124CopyrightKaihsuTai.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Addressing the [[haggis]]]]
Everyone stands as the main course is brought in. This is always a [[haggis]] on a large dish.  It is usually brought in by the cook, generally while a piper plays [[bagpipes]] and leads the way to the host's table, where the haggis is laid down. He/she might play '[[A Man's A Man for A' That|A man's a man for a' that]]', 'Robbie Burns Medley' or 'The Star O' Robbie Burns'.&lt;ref&gt;Archie Cairns - Book 1 Pipe Music 1995&lt;/ref&gt;  The host, or perhaps a guest with a talent, then recites the ''Address To a Haggis''

At the line ''His knife see rustic Labour dicht'' the speaker normally draws and cleans a knife, and at the line ''An' cut you up wi' ready slicht'', plunges it into the haggis and cuts it open from end to end.  When done properly this &quot;ceremony&quot; is a highlight of the evening.

=== Supper ===
[[File:Haggis.JPG|thumb|left|Haggis platter at a Burns supper in the [[U.S.]]]]
At the end of the poem, a Scotch  whisky toast will be proposed to the haggis, then the company will sit and enjoy the meal.  The main course is haggis, and is traditionally served with mashed potatoes (tatties) and mashed turnip ([[rutabaga|neeps]]). A dessert course, cheese courses, coffee, etc. may also be part of the meal. The courses normally use traditional Scottish recipes.  For instance dessert may be [[cranachan]] or Tipsy Laird (whisky trifle) followed by oatcakes and cheese, all washed down with the &quot;water of life&quot; (uisge beatha) – Scotch whisky.
When the meal reaches the coffee stage various speeches and toasts are given.  In order, the core speeches and toasts are as follows.

=== Immortal memory ===
One of the guests gives a short speech, remembering some aspect of Burns' life or poetry.  This may be light-hearted or intensely serious.  The speaker should always prepare a speech with his audience in mind, since above all, the Burns' supper should be entertaining.

Everyone drinks a toast to Robert Burns.

=== Appreciation ===
The host will normally say a few words thanking the previous speaker for his speech and perhaps commenting on some of the points raised.

=== Toast to the Lassies ===
This was originally a short speech given by a male guest in thanks to those women who had prepared the meal.  However nowadays it is much more wide ranging, and generally covers the male speaker's view on women.  It is normally amusing but should never be offensive, particularly bearing in mind that it will be followed by a reply from the &quot;lassies&quot; concerned.

The men drink a toast to the women's health.

=== Reply to the Toast to the Lassies ===
This is occasionally (and humorously) called the 'Toast to the Laddies', and like the previous toast it is generally quite wide ranging nowadays. In it a female guest will give her views on men and reply to any specific points raised by the previous speaker.  Like the previous speech this should be amusing but not offensive.  Quite often the speakers giving this toast and the previous one will collaborate so that the two toasts complement each other.

=== Other toasts and speeches ===
These may follow if desired. It is not unusual to toast the locality or nation in which the supper is being held.

=== Works by Burns ===
After the speeches, there may be singing of songs by Burns -- ''Ae Fond Kiss'', ''Parcel O' Rogues'', ''A Man's a Man'', etc—and more poetry -- ''[[To a Mouse]]'', ''[[To a Louse]]'', ''[[Tam o' Shanter (Burns poem)|Tam O' Shanter]]'', ''The Twa Dugs'', ''Holy Willie's Prayer'', etc.  This may be done by the individual guests or by invited experts.  It goes on for as long as the guests wish and may include other works by poets influenced by Burns, particularly poets writing in Scots.

=== Closing ===
Finally the host will wind things up, calling on one of the guests to give the vote of thanks, after which everyone is asked to stand, join hands, and sing '' [[Auld Lang Syne]] '' which brings the evening to an end.

'''William McGuire &quot;Bill&quot; Bryson''', [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]], (born December 8, 1951) is a best-selling American author of humorous books on travel, as well as books on the English language and on science. Born an American, he was a resident of [[North Yorkshire]], UK, for most of his professional life before moving back to the US in 1995. In 2003 Bryson moved back to the UK, living in Norfolk, and was appointed Chancellor of [[Durham University]].

== Early life ==
Bill Bryson was born in [[Des Moines, Iowa]], the son of [[Bill Bryson Sr.|William]] and Mary Bryson. He has an older brother, [[Michael Bryson|Michael]], and a sister, Mary Jane Elizabeth.

Bryson was educated at [[Drake University]] but dropped out in 1972, deciding to instead backpack around Europe for four months. He returned to Europe the following year with a high school friend, the pseudonymous Stephen Katz. Some of his experiences from this trip are relived as flashbacks in ''[[Neither Here Nor There: Travels in Europe]]'', which documents a similar journey Bryson made twenty years later.

==Move to United Kingdom==
Bryson first visited the United Kingdom in 1973 during a tour of Europe, and decided to stay after landing a job working in a psychiatric hospital – the now defunct [[Holloway Sanatorium]] in [[Virginia Water]], [[Surrey]]. He met a nurse there named Cynthia, whom he married, and they moved to the USA in 1975 so Bryson could complete his college degree. In 1977, they settled in the UK, where they remained until 1995. Living in [[North Yorkshire]] and mainly working as a [[journalist]], Bryson eventually became chief copy editor of the business section of ''[[The Times]]'', and then deputy national news editor of the business section of ''[[The Independent]]''. He left journalism in 1987, three years after the birth of his third child. Still living in [[Kirkby Malham]], North Yorkshire, Bryson started writing independently and in 1990 their fourth and final child, Sam, was born.

==Writings==
In 1995, Bryson returned to the United States to live in [[Hanover, New Hampshire]], for some years, the stories of which feature in his book ''I'm A Stranger Here Myself'', alternatively titled ''Notes from a Big Country'' in the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia. During his time in the United States, Bryson decided to walk the [[Appalachian Trail]] with his friend Stephen Katz (a pseudonym), about which he wrote the book ''[[A Walk in the Woods]]''. In 2003 the Brysons and their four children returned to the UK, and now live in Norfolk.

Also in 2003, in conjunction with [[World Book and Copyright Day|World Book Day]], voters in the United Kingdom chose Bryson's book ''[[Notes from a Small Island]]'' as that which best sums up British identity and the state of the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, he was appointed a Commissioner for [[English Heritage]].

In 2004, Bryson won the prestigious [[The Aventis Prizes for Science Books|Aventis Prize]] for best general science book with ''[[A Short History of Nearly Everything]]''.&lt;ref name=descartes&gt;{{Cite news| first = Michelle | last = Pauli| title = Bryson wins Descartes prize for his guide to science| newspaper = The Guardian| date = 2005-12-07| url = http://education.guardian.co.uk/higher/profile/story/0,11109,1642405,00.html | location=London| postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; This 500-page popular literature piece explores not only the histories and current statuses of the sciences, but also reveals their humble and often humorous beginnings.

In 2005, the book won the EU [[Descartes Prize]] for science communication.&lt;ref name=descartes/&gt;

[[Image:Chancellor Bill Bryson at Degree Ceremony Durham University cropped.jpg|thumb|Bryson in the regalia of Chancellor of [[Durham University]], with the Cathedral in the background]]
Bryson has also written two popular works on the history of the English language &amp;mdash; ''[[The Mother Tongue (book)|Mother Tongue]]'' and ''[[Made In America (book)|Made in America]]'' &amp;mdash; and, more recently, an update of his guide to usage, ''[[Bryson's Dictionary of Troublesome Words]]'' (published in its first edition as ''The Penguin Dictionary of Troublesome Words'' in 1983). These books were popularly acclaimed and well-reviewed, though they received some criticism claiming that they contained factual errors, urban myths and [[folk etymologies]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amazon.com/dp/0380715430 The Mother Tongue], Amazon.com.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amazon.com/dp/0767910435 Bryson's Dictionary of Troublesome Words: A Writer's Guide to Getting It Right], Amazon.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honours==
In 2005, Bryson was appointed [[Chancellor (education)|Chancellor]] of [[Durham University]],&lt;ref name=chancellor/&gt; succeeding the late [[Peter Ustinov|Sir Peter Ustinov]], and has been particularly active with student activities, even appearing in a Durham student film (the sequel to ''[[The Assassinator]]'') and promoting litter picks in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

He has also been awarded honorary degrees by numerous universities, including [[Bournemouth University]] and in April 2002 the [[Open University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/higher/bill-bryson-visits-his-utopia-650507.html Bill Bryson visits his utopia] (May 7, 2002), [http://www.independent.co.uk The Independent].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Bryson received the President's Award from the Royal Society of Chemistry for advancing the cause of the chemical sciences. In the same year, Bryson and the RSC jointly created the Bill Bryson prize, an annual award to encourage science writing in schools.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsc.org/AboutUs/News/PressReleases/2005/Westminstersetting.asp &quot;Westminster setting for Bill Bryson award&quot;], October 31, 2005, accessed November 21, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2006, [[Frank Cownie]], the [[mayor]] of Des Moines, awarded Bryson the [[Freedom of the City|key to the city]] and announced that 21 October 2006 would be known as &quot;Bill Bryson, The Thunderbolt Kid, Day.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;The City of Des Moines [http://web.archive.org/web/20080625025709/http://www.randomhouse.com/features/billbryson/news/CityofDesMoinesProclamation.pdf Proclamation of October 21, 2006 as &quot;The Thunderbird Kid&quot; Day] (archived from [http://www.randomhouse.com/features/billbryson/news/CityofDesMoinesProclamation.pdf the original] on 2008-06-25)&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2006, Bryson interviewed the then Prime Minister of the United Kingdom [[Tony Blair]] on the state of science and education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite

'''Big Audio Dynamite''' (later known as '''Big Audio Dynamite II''' and '''Big Audio''', and often abbreviated '''BAD''') are a British musical group formed in 1984 by the ex-guitarist and singer of [[The Clash]], [[Mick Jones (The Clash)|Mick Jones]]. The group is noted for their effective mixture of varied musical styles, incorporating elements of punk rock, dance music, hip hop, reggae, and funk. BAD's one constant throughout frequent shifts in membership and musical direction are the vocals provided by Mick Jones. After releasing a number of well-received albums and touring extensively throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Big Audio Dynamite disbanded in 1997, but have announced a reunion as of January 2011.

==History==
===T.R.A.C. (1984)===

After being ousted from The Clash in 1983 and following a brief stint with the band [[General Public]], Mick Jones formed a new band called Top Risk Action Company (T.R.A.C.) He recruited bassist [[Leo Williams (musician)|Leo &quot;E-Zee Kill&quot; Williams]], saxophone player [[John &quot;Boy&quot; Lennard]] (from [[Theatre of Hate]]), and ex-Clash drummer [[Topper Headon|Nicky &quot;Topper&quot; Headon]]. However, Headon was quickly sacked for his heroin addiction and Lennard either left or was fired and the band folded.&lt;ref&gt;[http://beatpatrol.wordpress.com/2010/05/10/big-audio-dynamite-this-is-big-audio-dynamite-1985 Big Audio Dynamite – “This Is Big Audio Dynamite” (1985)]&lt;/ref&gt; Although the band released no material (only demos were recorded which have yet to be officially released), T.R.A.C. can be seen as a forerunner to Big Audio Dynamite in much the same way [[London SS]] can be seen as an early incarnation of The Clash.

===Big Audio Dynamite (1984–1990)===

Jones  then formed Big Audio Dynamite with film director [[Don Letts]] (maker of ''[[The Punk Rock Movie]]'', various Clash music videos, and later The Clash documentary ''[[Westway to the World]]''), bassist Leo Williams (from T.R.A.C.), drummer [[Greg Roberts (musician)|Greg Roberts]], and keyboardist [[Dan Donovan]].  In 1985 the group's debut, ''[[This Is Big Audio Dynamite]],'' was released.  The album's cover shows the group as a four-piece (minus Donovan); the full group is pictured on the back cover.

1986's ''No. 10, Upping St.'' reunited Jones for one album with former Clash band-mate [[Joe Strummer]], who was a co-producer of the album and co-writer of a number of its songs. BAD supported [[U2]] on their 1987 world tour, then released 1988's ''Tighten Up, Vol. '88'' and 1989's ''Megatop Phoenix''. [[Tighten Up, Vol. 88]] contained &quot;Just Play Music!&quot;, which was the second #1 single on Billboard's [[Modern Rock Tracks]]. The band also recorded an unreleased track called &quot;Keep Off the Grass&quot; which was a rock-style instrumental of the theme to the classic western film, ''[[The Magnificent Seven]]''. A promo video can be seen on YouTube.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srNAFh86YNk&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, the original line-up wrote and recorded the song &quot;Free&quot; for the soundtrack to the movie ''[[Flashback (1990 film)|Flashback]]''. This would be the final song written with the original lineup, as the band would dissolve shortly after. Interesting note... &quot;Bottom Line&quot; from the first lp was remixed and used as the title track for &quot;Flashback.&quot; However this track was not included on the soundtrack. It can be found on the 12&quot; or by possible download. Later in 1990, Mick Jones would debut Big Audio Dynamite II and release the UK only album ''Kool-Aid''. Dan Donovan would remain in BAD II for one song, a re-working of the final BAD track &quot;Free&quot; renamed &quot;Kickin' In&quot;.

===Big Audio Dynamite II (1991–1993)===
For 1990's ''[[The Globe (album)|The Globe]]'', only Jones remained from BAD, and the band was now called '''Big Audio Dynamite II'''.  This new line-up featured two guitarists. ''The Globe'' featured the band's most commercially successful single, &quot;[[Rush (BAD song)|Rush]]&quot; which hit #1 on both the US modern rock chart and the [[Australian]] National [[ARIA Charts|Aria]] Chart. &quot;Innocent Child&quot; and &quot;The Globe&quot; were also released as singles.
BAD supported U2 on their ZooTV tour and released the live E.P. &quot;On The Road Live '92&quot;.

===Big Audio (1994)===
The band later recruited keyboardist Andre Shapps (co-producer of ''The Globe'') and Michael &quot;DJ Zonka&quot; Custance as DJ and vocalist. Both appeared on the band's 1994 album ''[[Higher Power (album)|Higher Power]]'', which was released under the shortened name &quot;Big Audio&quot;.

===Final years and subsequent activities (1995–2010)===
After signing with [[Gary Kurfirst]]'s [[Radioactive Records]] in 1995, the band reverted to the original &quot;Big Audio Dynamite&quot; moniker and released their least successful album to date, ''[[F-Punk]]''.

Radioactive Records refused to release the next proposed BAD album, ''[[Entering a New Ride]]''.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}  The line-up contained Mc vocals by 
[[Joe Attard]] ([[Punks Jump Up]]), [[Ranking Roger]] ([[The Beat (band)|The Beat]], [[General Public]]) and drummer Bob Wond (Under Two Flags) In 1998, the band launched a new web site, primarily as a means to distribute songs from the ''Entering a New Ride'' album.

Since 2005, Jones has been working on a project with [[Tony James]] (ex-member of [[Generation X (band)|Generation X]] and [[Sigue Sigue Sputnik]]) called [[Carbon/Silicon]].

In early 2007, a BAD II live DVD was released.

===2011 reunion===
In April 2010, [[Don Letts]] revealed to [[Billboard.com]] that he and [[Mick Jones (The Clash)|Mick Jones]] broached the idea of a Big Audio Dynamite reunion in 2011. He explained, &quot;I could lie to you and say 'Not in a million years,' but...if Mick wasn't tied up with [[Gorillaz]] it might happen this year. (Jones) has looked at me and said, 'Maybe next year,' but who knows. I've got to admit that in the past I'm not a great one for reformations; I always think if you're lucky in life, you get a window of opportunity, use it to the best of your ability and then fuck off and let someone else have their turn. But here I am 25 years down the line considering the thing.&quot; Besides a Big Audio Dynamite reunion, Letts said he was also hopeful for more Legacy Editions of the group's albums after finding more unreleased material—including live recordings—in the vaults. &quot;There's definitely more stuff; whether Sony thinks it's worthwhile, that's another matter. But there seems to be a lot of respect for Big Audio Dynamite. Time has shown that a lot of the things we were dabbling in back then have come to manifest themselves today...so hopefully we'll get to do some more.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.billboard.com/news/big-audio-dynamite-reignited-1004081637.story Big Audio Dynamite Reignited | Billboard.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

The reformation of the original line up of B.A.D was officially confirmed on 25 January 2011 with the announcement of a UK tour.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nme.com/news/big-audio-dynamite/54684 Big Audio Dynamite reform with original line-up - NME]&lt;/ref&gt; The 9-date tour was a commercial and critical success. The first of their two sold out Shepherd's Bush Empire shows received a 4 star review in ''The Times'' ('Not just a reformation - this is ''their'' time'), ''The Observer'' welcomed B.A.D's return with a glowing review declaring, 'they remain a joy'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2011/apr/10/naked-famous-big-audio-dynamite-review The Naked and Famous; Big Audio Dynamite – review]&lt;/ref&gt; ''News Of The World'' awarded their Manchester Academy show a 5 star review and proclaimed, 'Easily the reformation of the year'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/notw/_lifestyle/nollifestyle_entertainment/nolentertainment_music/1272125/Live-Big-Audio-Dynamite-in-Manchester.html News of the World: The Best for News, Showbiz and Sport Exclusives | News Of The World]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bentley Motors Limited''' is a British manufacturer of [[automobile]]s founded on 18 January 1919 by Walter Owen Bentley known as [[W.O. Bentley]] or just &quot;W O&quot;.  Bentley had been previously known for his range of [[Rotary engine|rotary]] [[aircraft engine|aero-engine]]s in [[World War I]], the most famous being the [[Bentley BR1]] as used in later versions of the [[Sopwith Camel]].   After the war W. O. Bentley designed and made production cars that won the [[24 hours of Le Mans]] in [[1924 24 Hours of Le Mans|1924]] and following models which repeated those successes each June [[1927 24 Hours of Le Mans|1927]], [[1928 24 Hours of Le Mans|1928]], [[1929 24 Hours of Le Mans|1929]] and [[1930 24 Hours of Le Mans|1930]].   

Purchased by [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls-Royce]] in 1931 the company has been owned by the [[Volkswagen Group]] of Germany since 1998. The business is still based in [[Crewe]], Cheshire, [[England]] with their [[Bentley Crewe|Central Production Facilities]] there.

==Cricklewood==

Before World War I, W.O. Bentley had been in partnership with his brother H.M. Bentley selling French [[Doriot, Flandrin &amp; Parant|DFP]] cars, but he had always wanted to design and build his own range of cars bearing his name.  In August 1919, Bentley Motors Ltd. was registered, and a chassis with dummy engine was exhibited at the [[British International Motor Show|London Motor Show]] in October of that year.&lt;ref name=Beaulieu&gt;{{Cite book|last=Georgano|first=N.|title=Beaulieu Encyclopedia of the Automobile|year=2000|publisher=HMSO|location=London|isbn=1-57958-293-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An engine was built and running by December, and orders were taken for deliveries starting in June 1920; however, development took longer than estimated, and the first cars were not ready until September 1921.&lt;ref name=Beaulieu/&gt; Their durability earned widespread acclaim.  Appearances were made in hill climbs and at [[Brooklands]] and a single entry in the [[1922 Indianapolis 500]] mile race driven by [[W. Douglas Hawkes]] finished at an average speed in excess of 80 miles an hour.

Rolls-Royce stopped the racing programme

It was on a visit to the DFP factory in 1913 that W.O. noticed an aluminium paperweight, and had the inspired idea of using the lightweight metal instead of cast iron to make engine pistons.  The first Bentley aluminium pistons went into service in aero engines for the Sopwith Camel during [[World War I]].

The enterprise was always underfunded.  Bentley turned for help to his friend—customer, racing driver and son of a millionaire—[[Woolf Barnato]] in 1925.  As part of a refinancing deal, which resulted in his effectively owning the company, Barnato became chairman.

===The Bentley Boys===
[[Image:1929 Bentley front 34 right.jpg|thumb|4½ litre [[Bentley Blower|&quot;Blower&quot; Bentley]] 1929 developed in Welwyn Garden City by &quot;Tim&quot; Birkin and pushed over W.O. to market before it was reliable]]
A group of wealthy British motorists known as the &quot;[[Bentley Boys]]&quot;—Woolf Barnato, [[Henry Birkin|Sir Henry &quot;Tim&quot; Birkin]], [[steeplechase (horse racing)|steeplechaser]] [[George Duller]], [[aviator]] [[Glen Kidston]], automotive journalist [[S.C.H. &quot;Sammy&quot; Davis]], and [[Dudley Benjafield|Dr Dudley Benjafield]] among them—kept the marque's reputation for high performance alive. Thanks to the dedication to serious racing of this group, the company, located at [[Cricklewood]], north London, was noted for its four consecutive victories at the [[24 hours of Le Mans]] from 1927 to 1930.  Their greatest competitor at the time, [[Bugatti]]—whose lightweight, elegant, but fragile creations contrasted with the Bentley's rugged reliability and durability—referred to them as &quot;the world's fastest lorries&quot;. Bugatti sold three of his Royale. Bentley sold one hundred of his 8 litre.

In March 1930, during the [[Blue Train Races]], Woolf Barnato raised the stakes on [[Rover Company|Rover]] and its [[Rover Light Six]], having raced and beat ''[[Le Train Bleu]]'' for the first time, to better that record with his 6½-litre [[Bentley Speed Six]] on a bet of £100.  He drove against the train from [[Cannes]] to [[Calais]], then by ferry to [[Dover]], and finally London, travelling on public highways, and won; the [[H.J. Mulliner &amp; Co.|H.J. Mulliner]]-bodied [[sedan (automobile)|formal saloon]] he drove during the race as well as a streamlined fastback &quot;Sportsman Coupé&quot; by [[J Gurney Nutting &amp; Co Limited|Gurney Nutting]]—he took delivery of on 21 May 1930—became known as the &quot;[[Blue Train Bentley]]s&quot;; the latter is regularly mistaken for (or erroneously referred to) as being the car that raced the Blue Train, while in fact Barnato named it in memory of his race.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ultimatecarpage.com/car/1698/Bentley-Speed-Six--Blue-Train-Special-.html|title=Bentley Speed Six 'Blue Train Special'|last=Melissen|first=Wouter|date=2004-01-12|work=UltimateCarPage|accessdate=2008-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://autoaficionado.net/issue/0101-38.html|title=The Slippery Shape of Power|last=Burgess-Wise|first=David|date=2006-01-01|work=Auto Aficionado|accessdate=2008-11-04}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Car models, Cricklewood===
The original model was the 3-litre, but as customers put heavier bodies on the chassis, a larger 4½-litre model followed.  Perhaps the most iconic model of the period is the 4½-litre &quot;Blower Bentley,&quot; with its distinctive [[supercharger]] projecting forward from the bottom of the grille.  Uncharacteristically fragile for a Bentley, it was not the racing workhorse the 6½-litre was.  It became famous in popular media as the vehicle of [[James Bond]] in the original novels, but not in film; [[John Steed]], in the television series ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]'', drove a Bentley.
[[File:1931 Bentley 8 litre Vanden Plas Tourer.jpg|thumb|220px|right|[[Bentley 8 Litre]] 1931 better than [[Rolls-Royce Phantom II]], saloon coachwork by van den Plas]]

The new 8-litre was such a success that when Barnato's money ran out in 1931 and Napier was planning to buy Bentley's business, Rolls-Royce snatched Bentley Motors at the last moment in order to kill its competition for the market of their most expensive model, Phantom II.

By July 1931 Barnato found he could no longer support the company and on the 10th, on the application of the mortgagee, the court appointed a Receiver to Bentley Motors Limited.&lt;ref&gt;Receiver Appointed Of Bentley Motors Limited Re Bentley Motors Limited; London Life Association Limited v. Bentley Motors Limited, And Woolf Barnato. ''The Times'', Saturday, Jul 11, 1931; pg. 4; Issue 45872&lt;/ref&gt;  



==Derby==
===&quot;The Silent Sports Car&quot;===
[[Image:1935-bentley-archives.jpg|right|thumb|1935 Bentley 3½-litre Cabriolet.]]
While a great deal of Woolf Barnato's fortune had been devoted to keeping Bentley afloat, the [[Great Depression]] reduced demand for the company's expensive products and after being put into receivership in 1931 W O Bentley's business together with three years of Bentley's own design services was secretly bought by [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls-Royce]].

[[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls-Royce]] acquired Bentley using an entity named the British Central Equitable Trust; not even Bentley himself knew the true identity of the purchaser until the deal was completed.&lt;ref name=Beaulieu/&gt;  A new company, wholly owned by Rolls-Royce, was formed as Bentley Motors (1931) Ltd.  The [[Cricklewood]] factory was closed and sold, and production moved to the Rolls-Royce works in [[Derby]].  Unhappy with his role at Rolls-Royce, when his contract expired at the end of April 1935 W.O. Bentley left to join [[Lagonda]].

When the new [[Bentley 3.5 Litre|Bentley 3½ litre]] appeared in 1933, it was a sporting variant of the [[Rolls-Royce 20/25]], which disappointed some traditional customers yet was well-received by many others.  Even Bentley himself was reported as saying, &quot;Taking all things into consideration, I would rather own this Bentley than any other car produced under that name&quot;.&lt;ref name=Beaulieu/&gt;

==Crewe==
[[Image:Bentley Mark VI Autotron NL 1990.jpg|right|thumb|1952 [[Bentley R Type]]: an evolution of the Mark VI, which was the first Bentley available from the manufacturer with a standard body.]]

Until the second World War companies like Bentley and Rolls-Royce did not supply complete cars. They sold a rolling chassis, near-complete from the instrument panel forward. This was delivered to the coachbuilder of the buyer's choice. In general the biggest dealerships had coachbuilders build standard designs for them and held them in stock awaiting potential buyers. Very far from 100% of production received an individual bespoke body.

===Post-war standard-steel saloons===
This being so it made sense to meet postwar demand for much more ruggedly constructed cars by the Crewe factory assembling complete vehicles using bought-in pressings. Rolling chassis were still available to coachbuilders.

===Badge engineering===
After World War II production of Rolls-Royce and Bentley cars was moved to an ex-wartime engine factory in [[Crewe]], [[Cheshire]] and standard-steel Bentleys were slightly lower priced Rolls-Royces without the Rolls' distinctive square-shouldered grille.

===Bentley Continental===
[[Image:Bentley SI Continental Fastback Coupe Mulliner.jpg|right|thumb|Bentley Continental, fastback coupé body by H J Mulliner]]
The Continental fastback coupé was produced principally for the domestic home market, the majority of cars produced (165, including a [[prototype]]) being right-hand drive. The chassis was produced at the Crewe factory and shared many components with the standard R type. Other than the R-Type standard steel saloon, R-Type Continentals were delivered as rolling chassis to the [[coachbuilder]] of choice. Coachwork for most of these cars was completed by [[H. J. Mulliner &amp; Co.]] who mainly built them in fastback coupe form. Other coachwork came from [[Park Ward]] (London) who built six, later including a drophead coupe version. Franay (Paris) built five, Graber (Wichtrach, Switzerland) built three, one of them later altered by Köng (Basle, Switzerland), and [[Pininfarina]] made one. [[James Young (coachbuilder)|James Young]] (London) built in 1954 a Sports Saloon for the owner of the company, James Barclay.

The early R Type Continental has essentially the same engine as the standard R Type, but with modified carburation, induction and exhaust manifolds along with higher gear ratios.&lt;ref name=Autocar1969&gt;{{cite journal | authorlink = |title = Used Car test: Bentley Continental| journal =[[Autocar]]| volume = 130 (nbr3824) | pages = 47–48| date = 29 May 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;   After July 1954 the car was fitted with an engine, having now a larger bore of 94.62&amp;nbsp;mm (3.7&amp;nbsp;in) with a total displacement of 4.9&amp;nbsp;L (4887&amp;nbsp;cc/298&amp;nbsp;in³). The compression ratio was raised to 7.25:1.

==Vickers==
The problems of Bentley's owner with Rolls-Royce aero engine development, the [[RB211]], brought about the financial collapse of its business in 1970. 

The motorcar division was made a separate business, [[Rolls-Royce Motors|Rolls-Royce Motors Limited]], which remained independent until bought by [[Vickers plc]] in August 1980.  By the 1970s and early 1980s Bentley sales had fallen badly; at one point less than 5% of combined production carried the Bentley badge.&lt;ref name=Beaulieu/&gt; Under Vickers, Bentley set about regaining its high-performance heritage, typified by the 1980 [[Bentley Mulsanne|Mulsanne]].  Bentley's restored sporting image created a renewed interest in the name and sales as a proportion of combined company output began to rise.  By 1986 the Bentley:Rolls-Royce ratio had reached 40:60; by 1991 it achieved parity.&lt;ref name=Beaulieu/&gt;

===BMW v VW===
In 1998, Vickers decided to sell Rolls-Royce Motors.  The leading contender seemed to be [[BMW]], who already supplied engines and other components for Bentley (and Rolls-Royce) cars.  Their final offer of [[Pound Sterling|£]]340m was outbid by [[Volkswagen Group]], who offered £430m.  Volkswagen Group got the Crewe works and found it held the rights to Rolls-Royce's &quot;Spirit of Ecstasy&quot; mascot and the shape of that radiator grille but no rights to the Rolls-Royce name or logo.   In 1998 BMW had recently started supplying components for the new range of Rolls-Royce and Bentley cars, notably [[V8 engine]]s for the [[Bentley Arnage]], and [[V12 engine]]s for the [[Rolls-Royce Silver Seraph]].  It also emerged that BMW was able to terminate its supply deal with Rolls-Royce with 12 months' notice, which would not be enough time for Volkswagen Group to re-engineer the cars.

BMW paid Vickers £40m to license the Rolls-Royce name and &quot;RR&quot; logo, a deal that many commentators thought was a bargain for possibly the most valuable property in the deal.  Volkswagen claimed that it only really wanted Bentley anyway.  Bentley was the higher volume brand, with Bentley models out-selling the equivalent Rolls Royce by around two to one.
[[Image:bentleyazure.JPG|thumb|right|220px|Bentley Azure Mulliner 2003  Final Series.]]
After negotiations, BMW and Volkswagen Group arrived at a solution.  From 1998 to 2002, BMW would continue to supply engines for the cars and would allow Volkswagen temporary use of the Rolls-Royce name and logo.  Bentley reintroduced the venerable [[Rolls-Royce V8 engine]] into the Arnage, initially as an additional model, and all BMW engine supply ended in 2003 with the end of Silver Seraph production.
From 1 January 2003 Volkswagen Group would build only cars called &quot;Bentley&quot;.  Rolls-Royce production was relocated to their [[Goodwood plant]] in [[Goodwood|Goodwood, West Sussex]], England.

It was reported that Volkswagen invested a total of nearly US$2 billion in Bentley and its revival.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/04_49/b3911105.htm |title=VW Steals A Lead In Luxury |date=2004-12-06 |author=Gail Edmondson |publisher=BusinessWeek |accessdate=2010-06-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Bentley presented [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] with an official [[Bentley State Limousine|State Limousine]] to celebrate the [[Golden Jubilee]].  In 2003, Bentley's 2-door convertible, the [[Bentley Azure]], ceased production, and the company introduced a second line, [[Bentley Continental GT]], a large luxury coupé powered by a [[W12 engine]] built in Crewe.

Demand had been so great, that the factory at Crewe was unable to meet orders despite an installed capacity of approximately 9500 vehicles per year; there was a waiting list of over a year for new cars to be delivered.  Consequently, part of the production of the new [[Bentley Continental Flying Spur (2005)|Flying Spur]], a four-door version of the Continental GT, was assigned to the [[Transparent Factory]] (Germany), where the [[Volkswagen Phaeton]] luxury car is also assembled.  This arrangement ceased at the end of 2006 after around 1000 cars, with all car production reverting to the Crewe plant.

In April 2005, Bentley confirmed plans to produce a four seat convertible model—the [[Bentley Azure|Azure]], derived from the [[Bentley Arnage|Arnage Drophead Coupé]] prototype—at Crewe beginning in 2006.  By the autumn of 2005, the convertible version of the successful Continental GT, the [[Bentley Continental|Continental GTC]], was also presented.  These two models were successfully launched in late 2006.

A limited run of a [[Zagato]] modified GT was also announced in March 2008, dubbed &quot;GTZ&quot;.

A new Bentley version of the Bentley Continental was introduced at the 2009 [[Geneva Auto Show]]: The [[Bentley Continental GT#Supersports|Continental Supersports]].  This new Bentley is a supercar combining extreme power with environmentally friendly FlexFuel technology.  A muscular two-seater with distinctive exterior and interior styling, the Supersports is unmistakably Bentley in design, craftsmanship and performance.  The engine derived from Bentley’s current W12 power unit was re-engineered, re-tuned and re-mapped to achieve phenomenal supercar potency.  0-60&amp;nbsp;mph in 3.7 seconds (0–100&amp;nbsp;km/h 3.9 seconds).  {{convert|621|bhp|kW PS|0|lk=on}}  {{convert|800|Nm|0|lk=on}} at 2,000 to 4,500 rpm.  The Continental Supersports is the fastest, most powerful production Bentley ever.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=FT_7|title=The Extreme Bentley|url=http://www.bentleymotors.com/models/continental_series/continental_supersports/introduction/default.aspx|accessdate =2009-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bentley sales continued to increase, and in 2005 8,627 were sold worldwide, 3,654 in the United States.  In 2007 the 10,000 cars-per-year threshold was broken for the first time in the company's history with sales of 10,014.  For 2007, a record profit of €155 million was also announced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Bentley reports record profit|last=Garlick|url=http://www.pistonheads.com/news/default.asp?storyId=17750|accessdate=2008-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Bentley reported a sale of about 7,600 units in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=ajtqDKRS4Rno |title=Daimler Maybach Fails to Dent Rolls, Bentley Super-Luxury Lead |date=2009-12-15 |author=Chris Reiter and Mike Ramsey |publisher=Bloomberg }}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, its global sales plunged 50 percent to 4,616 vehicles in 2009 (with the U.S. deliveries dropped 49% to 1,433 vehicles) and it suffered an operating loss of €194 million, compared with a profit of €10 million in 2008.&lt;ref name=BW062410/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-01-14/volkswagen-s-bentley-targets-u-s-growth-with-mulsanne-sedan.html |title=Volkswagen’s Bentley Targets U.S. Growth With Mulsanne Sedan |date=2010-01-14 |author=Andreas Cremer |publisher=BusinessWeek |accessdate=2010-06-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chordates''' ([[phylum]] '''Chordata''') are [[animal]]s which are either [[vertebrate]]s or one of several closely related [[invertebrate]]s. They are united by having, for at least some period of their life cycle, a [[notochord]], a hollow [[dorsal nerve cord]], [[pharyngeal slit]]s, an [[endostyle]], and a post-anal [[tail]]. The phylum Chordata consists of three subphyla: [[Urochordata]], represented by [[tunicate]]s; [[Cephalochordata]], represented by [[lancelet]]s; and [[Craniata]], which includes [[vertebrate|Vertebrata]]. The [[Hemichordata]] have been presented as a fourth chordate subphylum, but they are now usually treated as a separate phylum. Urochordate larvae have both a notochord and a nerve cord which are lost in adulthood. Cephalochordates have a notochord and a nerve cord (but no [[brain]] or specialist sensory organs) and a very simple [[circulatory system]]. Craniates are the only sub-phylum whose members have [[skull]]s. In all craniates except for [[hagfish]], the dorsal hollow nerve cord is surrounded with [[cartilaginous]] or bony vertebrae and the notochord is generally reduced; hence, hagfish are not regarded as vertebrates. The chordates and three sister [[phylum|phyla]], the [[Hemichordata]], the [[Echinodermata]] and the [[Xenoturbellida]], make up the [[deuterostomes]], one of the two [[superphylum|superphyla]] that encompass all fairly complex animals.

Attempts to work out the evolutionary relationships of the chordates have produced several hypotheses. The current consensus is that chordates are [[monophyletic]], meaning that Chordata contains all and only the descendants of a single common ancestor ''which is itself a chordate'', and that craniates' nearest relatives are cephalochordates. All of the earliest chordate [[fossil]]s have been found in the Early [[Cambrian]] [[Chengjiang fauna]], and include two species that are regarded as [[fish]], which implies that they are vertebrates. Because the fossil record of chordates is poor, only [[molecular phylogenetics]] offers a reasonable prospect of dating their emergence. However, the use of molecular phylogenetics for dating evolutionary transitions is controversial.

It has also proved difficult to produce a detailed classification within the living chordates. Attempts to produce evolutionary &quot;[[phylogenetic tree|family trees]]&quot; give results that differ from traditional [[class (biology)|classes]] because several of those classes are not monophyletic. As a result vertebrate classification is in a state of flux.

==Closest non-chordate relatives==
===The Hemichordates===
{{main|Hemichordate}}
[[Image:Balanoglossus 01.png|thumb|upright|[[Enteropneust]] hemichordate: ''[[Balanoglossus]]'' ]]

[[Hemichordate]]s (&quot;half chordates&quot;) have some features similar to those of chordates: branchial openings that open into the [[pharynx]] and look rather like gill slits; stomochords, similar in composition to [[notochord]]s but running in a circle round the &quot;collar&quot;, which is ahead of the mouth; and a [[Anatomical terms of location#Dorsal and ventral|dorsal]] nerve cord — but also a smaller [[Anatomical terms of location#Dorsal and ventral|ventral]] nerve cord.

There are two living groups of hemichordates. The solitary [[enteropneust]]s, commonly known as &quot;acorn worms&quot;, have long [[proboscis|probosces]] and worm-like bodies with up to 200 branchial slits, are up to {{convert|2.5|m|ft}} long, and burrow though seafloor [[sediment]]s. [[Pterobranch]]s are [[colony (biology)|colonial]] animals, often less than {{convert|1|mm|in}} long individually, whose dwellings are inter-connected. Each [[filter feeding|filter feeds]] by means of a pair of branched tentacles, and has a short, shield-shaped proboscis. The extinct [[graptolite]]s, colonial animals whose fossils look like tiny [[hacksaw]] blades, lived in tubes similar to those of pterobranchs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===The Echinoderms===
{{main|Echinoderm}}
[[Image:Sandstar 300.jpg|thumb|200px|Echinoderm: [[starfish]]]]
[[Echinoderm]]s differ from chordates and their other relatives in three conspicuous ways: instead of having [[bilateral symmetry]] they have [[radial symmetry]], meaning their body pattern is shaped like a wheel; they have [[tube feet]]; and their bodies are supported by [[skeleton]]s made of [[calcite]], a material not used by chordates. The hard calcified shell keeps their bodies well protected from the environment, and these skeletons enclose their bodies but are also covered by a thin skin. The feet are powered by another unique feature of echinoderms, a [[water vascular system]] of canals that also function as a &quot;lung&quot; and are surrounded by muscles that act as pumps. [[Crinoid]]s look rather like flowers, and use their feather-like arms to filter food particles out of the water; most live anchored to rocks, but a few can move very slowly. Other echinoderms are mobile and take a variety of body shapes, for example [[starfish]], [[sea urchin]]s and [[Holothuroidea|sea cucumbers]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CowenHistLifeEd3P412&quot;&gt;{{ cite book

== Origins ==
The majority of animals more complex than [[jellyfish]] and other [[Cnidarians]] are split into two groups, the [[protostome]]s and [[deuterostome]]s, and chordates are deuterostomes.&lt;ref name=Erwin20002&gt;{{cite journal|author=Erwin, Douglas H.; Eric H.

The evolutionary relationships between the chordate groups and between chordates as a whole and their closest deuterostome relatives have been debated since 1890. Studies based on anatomical, [[embryology|embryological]], and paleontological data have produced different &quot;family trees&quot;. Some closely linked chordates and hemichordates, but that idea is now rejected.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ruppert2005&quot; /&gt; Combining such analyses with data from a small set of [[ribosome]] [[RNA]] genes eliminated some older ideas, but open the possibility that tunicates (urochordates) are &quot;basal deuterostomes&quot;, in other words surviving members of the group from which echinoderms, hemichordates and chordates evolved.&lt;ref name=&quot;WinchellSullivanCameronSwallaMallatt2002&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; One other phylum, [[Xenoturbellida]], appears to be basal within the deuterostomes, in other words closer to the original deuterostomes than to the chordates, echinoderms and hemichordates.&lt;ref name=&quot;Perseke2007&quot;&gt;Perseke M, Hankeln T, Weich B, Fritzsch G, Stadler PF, Israelsson O, Bernhard D, Schlegel M.

Since chordates have left a poor fossil record, attempts have been made to calculate the key dates in their evolution by [[molecular phylogenetics]] techniques, in other words by analysing biochemical differences, mainly in RNA. One such study suggested that deuterostomes arose before {{ma|900}} and the earliest chordates around {{ma|896}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;BlairHedges2005&quot;/&gt; However molecular estimates of dates often disagree with each other and with the fossil record,&lt;ref name=&quot;BlairHedges2005&quot; /&gt; and their assumption that the [[molecular clock]] runs at a known constant rate has been challenged.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ayala1999MolClockMirages&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author= Ayala, F.J.|year=1999 |title=Molecular clock mirages |journal=[[BioEssays]] |volume=21|issue=1 |pages=71–75|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/abstract/60000186/ABSTRACT?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0 |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1521-1878(199901)21:1&lt;71::AID-BIES9&gt;3.0.CO;2-B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SchwartzMaresca20006DoMolClocksRun&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Schwartz, J.

&lt;!-- **************
The origin of chordates is currently unknown. The first clearly-identifiable chordates are reduced fish- or [[lancelet]]-like specimens from the [[Cambrian]]. Most speculations about their origin fit into one or more of these categories:

* A sediment-dwelling worm-like animal that evolved a flatter body and/or fins for swimming.
* A sessile tubular filter-feeder that evolved into a free-swimming animal via usage of fins. ([[Tunicates]], considered a chordate, are sessile filter feeders that have a tadpole-like larvae.)
* A drifting or swimming larva of some other kind of animal that eventually retained its swimming features into adulthood.

The notochord's stiffness in many chordates may have evolved to facilitate the effectiveness of alternating muscle contractions for swimming (in S-shaped movements). In other words, in order to bend the body, a muscle needs a rigid structure to pull against, and a notochord (at least before spines) is the main structure to provide this. Lack of a stiff body part would merely result in the shorting of the animal during muscle contractions instead of the bending motions needed for swimming.

'''Charlize Theron''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ʃ|ɑr|ˈ|l|iː|s|_|ˈ|θ|ɛr|ən}}; born 7 August 1975) is a [[South African]]&lt;!--Don't change this - The MOSBIO requires that only citizenship at the time of becoming notable is mentioned in the opening sentence. She was a SA citizen when she won her first Oscar--&gt; actress, film producer and former fashion model.

She rose to fame in the late 1990s following her roles in ''[[2 Days in the Valley]]'', ''[[Mighty Joe Young (1998 film)|Mighty Joe Young]]'', ''[[The Devil's Advocate (film)|The Devil's Advocate]]'' and ''[[The Cider House Rules (film)|The Cider House Rules]]''. She received critical acclaim and an [[Academy Award]] for her portrayal of [[serial killer]] [[Aileen Wuornos]] in the film ''[[Monster (2003 film)|Monster]]'', for which she became the first South African to win an Academy Award in a major acting category. She received another [[Academy Award]] nomination for her performance in ''[[North Country (film)|North Country]]''.

==Early life==
Theron was born in [[Benoni, Gauteng|Benoni]], Transvaal Province, South Africa, the only child of Gerda Jacoba Aletta (née Maritz; born 27 January 1953) and Charles Jacobus Theron (November 27, 1947&amp;nbsp;– June 21, 1991).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Charlize Theron|url=http://www.thebiographychannel.co.uk/biography_facts/854:1192:1/Charlize_Theron.htm|work=[[Biography Channel]]|accessdate=24 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother is of [[Germans|German]] descent and her father was of [[Occitan]] and [[Dutch people|Dutch]] ancestry; Theron is descended from early [[Huguenot]] settlers, and [[Second Boer War|Boer War]] figure [[Daniel Theron]] was her great-grandfather's brother.&lt;ref name=&quot;bookref1&quot; /&gt; &quot;Theron&quot; is an [[Occitan language|Occitan]] surname (originally spelled Théron) pronounced in [[Afrikaans]] as &quot;Tronn&quot;, although she has said that the way it is pronounced in South Africa is &quot;Thrown&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aclasscelebs.com/charlizet/interview.htm|title=interview|publisher=aclasscelebs.com|date=6 September 2001|accessdate=24 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; She changed the pronunciation when she moved to the U.S.

Her father died on 21 June 1991, after he was shot by Theron's mother. Theron's father, who suffered from alcoholism, physically attacked her mother and threatened both women while being drunk. The shooting was legally adjudged to have been self-defence and her mother faced no charges.&lt;ref name=&quot;bookref1&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Charlize: Life's One Helluva Ride|last=Karsten|first=Chris|authorlink=|coauthors=|publisher=Human &amp; Rousseau|year=2009|location=|pages=14–19|month=|url=http://www.scribd.com/doc/21251449/Charlize-Life-s-One-Helluva-Ride|id=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thebiographychannel.co.uk/biographies/charlize-theron.html ''Biography of Charlize Theron'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Theron attended Putfontein Primary School (Laerskool Putfontein). At the age of 13, Theron was sent to boarding school and began her studies at the National School of the Arts in [[Johannesburg]].

==Career==
At the age of 16, Theron travelled to [[Milan]] on a one-year modeling contract, after winning a local competition. She went to New York with Pauline's Model Management. She decided to remain after her contract ended, attending the [[Joffrey Ballet School]], where she trained as a [[ballet]] dancer. A knee injury closed this career path when Theron was 19.&lt;ref name=CharAngel&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/indexes/2008/02/24/style/t/index.html#pagewanted=0&amp;pageName=24coverlynn&amp;|title= Charlize Angel|accessdate= 23 February 2008|author= Lynn Hirschberg|year= 2008|month= Spring|format=Flash|publisher= New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/interview/interviewpages/0,,1857161,00.html|title= Play It Tough|accessdate=23 February 2008|author= Charlotte Higgins|date=24 August 2006|publisher=The Guardian | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unable to dance, Theron flew to Los Angeles on a one-way ticket her mother bought her.&lt;ref name=CharAngel/&gt; During her early months there, she went to a bank to cash a cheque her mother had sent her to help with the rent. When the teller refused to cash it, Theron immediately started a shouting match with her. Afterwards, a talent agent in line behind her handed her his business card and subsequently introduced her to some casting agents and also an acting school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rd.com/celebrities/movie-celebs/face-to-face-with-charlize-theron/article.html|title=Charlize Theron Interview|accessdate=23 February 2008|author=Sara Davidson|year=2005|month=October|publisher=[[Reader's Digest]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indielondon.co.uk/Film-Review/in-the-valley-of-elah-charlize-theron-interview|title=In the Valley of Elah&amp;nbsp;— Charlize Theron interview|accessdate=23 February 2008|author=Jack Foley|publisher=indielondon.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; She later fired him as her manager after he kept sending her scripts for films similar to ''[[Showgirls]]'' and ''[[Species (film)|Species]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wmagazine.com/celebrities/2008/06/charlize_theron?printable=true|title=Charlize|accessdate=23 May 2008|author= Gabriel Snyder|year= 2008|month=June|publisher=[[W (magazine)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; After eight months in the city, she was cast in her first film part, a non-speaking role in the [[direct-to-video]] film ''[[Children of the Corn III]]'' (1995). Her breakout role was a supporting but significant part in ''[[2 Days in the Valley]]'',{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} but larger roles in widely released Hollywood films followed, and her career skyrocketed in the late 1990s with box office successes like ''[[The Devil's Advocate (film)|The Devil's Advocate]]'' (1997), ''[[Mighty Joe Young (1998 film)|Mighty Joe Young]]'' (1998) and ''[[The Cider House Rules (film)|The Cider House Rules]]'' (1999).

On 4 December 2009, Theron co-presented the draw for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] in [[Cape Town, South Africa]], accompanied by several other celebrities of South African origin. During rehearsals she drew an [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Ireland]] ball instead of [[France national football team|France]] as a joke at the expense of FIFA, referring to [[Thierry Henry]]'s handball controversy in the [[France vs Republic of Ireland (2010 FIFA World Cup Play-Off)|play off match]] between France and Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=If you want to get ahead...|url=http://www.independent.ie/sport/soccer/theron-has-a-ball-at-fifas-expense-1962410.html |title=&quot;Theron has a ball at FIFA's expense&quot; by Jason O'Brien, ''Irish Independent'', Thursday December&amp;nbsp;3, 2009|publisher=Independent.ie|date=3 December 2009|accessdate=8 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://tonight.co.za/index.php?fSectionId=354&amp;fArticleId=5273884 Charlize puts Ireland in the finals]. 4 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The stunt alarmed FIFA enough for it to fear she might do it again in front of a live global audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishcentral.com/sport/FIFA-shock-as-Charlize-Theron-picks-Ireland-as-first-team-for-World-Cup-78329492.html |title=FIFA shock as Charlize Theron picks Ireland as first team in World Cup draw, Hollywood star pulls stunt on World Cup officials in South Africa |publisher=Irishcentral.com |date= |accessdate=8 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Theron lives in the Los Angeles area. She separated from her partner of almost a decade, Irish actor [[Stuart Townsend]] (with whom she starred in the 2004 film ''[[Head in the Clouds]]'' as well as in the 2002 film ''[[Trapped (2002 film)|Trapped]]''). The couple split up in January 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Charlize Theron 'rings off' after secret split with Stuart Townsend|first=Caroline|last=Graham|work=[[The Daily Mail]]|date=31 January 2010|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1247387/Charlize-Theron-rings-secret-split-Stuart-Townsend.html|accessdate=1 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theron became a naturalised citizen of the United States in May 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;cbs&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/03/12/entertainment/main3932852.shtml|title= Charlize Theron: Glad To Be A U.S. Citizen|accessdate= 17 August 2008|author=Judy Rosen|date=12 March 2008|publisher=[[CBS News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She signed with William Morris Endeavour in 2009 and is represented by CEO [[Ari Emanuel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/ari-emanuel-21st-century-hollywood-mogul-1746355.html |title=Ari Emanuel: 21st Century Hollywood Mogul |publisher=Independent.co.uk |date=15 July 2009 |accessdate=24 July 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health concerns===
While filming ''Æon Flux'' in Berlin, Germany, Theron suffered a [[Spinal disc herniation|herniated disc]] in her neck, which occurred as a result of her suffering a fall while filming a series of back [[handspring (gymnastics)|handsprings]]. This required her to wear a neck collar for a month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://movies.about.com/od/aeonflux/a/aeonct071705.htm|title= Charlize Theron Talks About Starring in &quot;Aeon Flux&quot;|accessdate=23 February 2008|author=Rebecca Murray|publisher=[[About.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2009, Theron was diagnosed with a serious stomach virus, thought to be contracted while travelling outside the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,531461,00.html|title=Report: Charlize Theron Hospitalized With Serious Virus|publisher=[[Foxnews.com]]|accessdate=10 July 2009|date=11 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was hospitalised at [[Cedars-Sinai Hospital]] and she finished convalescing in her own home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/275825|title=Charlize Theron Recovering From 'Unknown' Virus|publisher=Digitaljournal.com|date=|accessdate=8 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Promotional deals==
Having signed a deal with [[John Galliano]] in 2004, Theron replaced [[Estonian people|Estonian]] model [[Tiiu Kuik]] as the spokeswoman in the ''J'ADORE'' advertisements by [[Christian Dior]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2004/08/13/news/newsmakers/charlize_dior|title=Dior signs Charlize Theron|publisher=CNN|date=13 August 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Galliano has reputedly cited her as a [[muse]] and has been creating [[Haute couture|couture]] dresses for her to wear to formal red carpet events such as the Academy Awards and the Golden Globe Awards. {{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

From October 2005 to December 2006, Theron earned $3,000,000 for the use of her image in a worldwide print media advertising campaign for [[Raymond Weil]] watches.&lt;ref name=&quot;smoke&quot;&gt;[http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/years/2008/1001082theron1.html Charlize Theron's Screen Gems] from [[The Smoking Gun]]&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2006, she and her loan-out corporation were sued by Weil for breach of contract.&lt;ref name=&quot;smoke&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NewsMax&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://newsmax.com/archives/articles/2007/2/6/140336.shtml Actress Charlize Theron Sued by Swiss Watchmaker]&quot;. [[Associated Press]], 6 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The lawsuit was settled on 4 November 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accesshollywood.com/charlize-theron-settles-20m-lawsuit-brought-by-swiss-watchmaker_article_12006|title=Charlize Theron settles $20M lawsuit brought by Swiss watchmaker|publisher=Accesshollywood.com|date=4 November 2008|accessdate=24 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activism==
Theron is involved in [[feminism|women's rights]] organizations, and has marched in [[pro-choice]] rallies.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/04/26/1082831473096.html|title=Hillary takes on Bush|publisher=Sydney Morning Herald|date=26 April 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theron is also a supporter of [[animal rights]] and active member of [[PETA]]. She appeared in a PETA ad for their anti-fur campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.furisdead.com/feat/charlize|title=Charlize Theron Dogs the Fur Trade|publisher=People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA)|accessdate=16 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
She is a supporter of [[same-sex marriage]] and attended a march in [[Fresno, California]] on 30 May 2009.

In July 2009, it was announced that Theron's '''Africa Outreach Project''' (CTAOP) would form a coalition with LAFC Soccer Club to give soccer fields to rural areas in South Africa. LAFC Chelsea, one of the United States's most successful and prominent youth soccer clubs, made a three-year commitment to help build a community-wide soccer programme for the schools in the Umkhanyakude District. This help includes uniforms, cleats, balls and equipment, along with professional training for local coaches, referees and administrators. The soccer league training will also include life-saving health education administered through a CTAOP-funded mobile health program.&lt;ref name=&quot;looktothestars1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.looktothestars.org/news/2807-charlize-theron-gives-soccer-opportunities-to-children|title=Charlize Theron gives soccer opportunities to children|publisher=Looktothestars.org|date=15 July 2009|accessdate=24 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] on African soil for the very first time, CTAOP wants to put a spotlight on the urgent need to provide sustainable health, education and recreational resources to remote areas where HIV/AIDS rates are unacceptably high.&lt;!-- this info appears in the previously cited article --&gt;

Don Sheppards, president of LAFC Chelsea said: {{quote|When I learned about Charlize's incredible plan to give sustainable opportunities to young South Africans who are at enormous risk, I knew that LAFC Chelsea was in position to help.&lt;ref name=&quot;looktothestars1&quot; /&gt;}}{{quote|&quot;Our goal is to help truly create a safer, healthier and better life for young people in South Africa, especially those living in remote areas, and to ensure that the resources we bring are self sustaining. The three year commitment is so incredible and key to being sure that the program will be around for many years to come&quot;, says Charlize Theron. &quot;I'm overwhelmed with gratitude to Don and LAFC Chelsea for their commitment to help us give these beautiful, young people a recreational outlet that is sorely lacking from their lives.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;looktothestars1&quot; /&gt;}}

'''Chess''' is a two-player [[board game]] played on a [[chessboard]], a square-checkered board with 64&amp;nbsp;squares arranged in an eight-by-eight grid. Each player begins the game with sixteen [[Chess piece|pieces]]: One [[king (chess)|king]], one [[queen (chess)|queen]], two [[rook (chess)|rooks]], two [[knight (chess)|knights]], two [[bishop (chess)|bishops]], and eight [[pawn (chess)|pawns]]. Pieces [[#Movement|move]] in different assigned ways according to their type, and accordingly are used to attack and capture the opponent's pieces. The object of the game is to [[checkmate]] the opponent's king, whereby the king is under immediate attack (in &quot;[[Check (chess)|check]]&quot;) and there is no way to move or defend it. 

Games of chess begin according to either standard (studied in-depth) or non-standard [[chess openings|openings]], in which the purpose is the [[Glossary_of_chess#Develop|development]] of pieces —moving them into positions where they can be effective. Moves are chosen with offensive and defensive considerations, according to a strategy of attack, or to respond to urgent threats. Throughout the game, players seek to set up and execute [[Exchange (chess)|exchanges of pieces]] which gain the advantage in terms of [[Chess piece relative value|piece value]] or board position (for example, one may exchange a knight for a knight plus a pawn).  At critical stages, winning often requires solving unique or clever [[chess problem|situations or puzzles]]. In addition to checkmate, games may be won by resignation, if too much material has been lost, or if one's position is severely compromised and a checkmate appears unavoidable. [[Grandmaster (chess)|Strong players]] are those who have studied game openings and have developed the skills of depth and insight in their reading of the game position. Theoreticians have developed extensive [[chess strategy|chess strategies]] and [[chess tactics|tactics]] since the game's inception. 
 
The game's present form emerged in Europe during the second half of the 15th century, an evolution of an older Indian game, [[Shatranj]] (cf. [[Chaturanga]]). Organized competitive chess began during the 16th century. The first official [[World Chess Champion]], [[Wilhelm Steinitz]], claimed his title in 1886; the current World Champion is [[Viswanathan Anand]] from [[India]]. In addition to the World Championship, there is the [[Women's World Chess Championship|Women's World Championship]], the [[World Junior Chess Championship|Junior World Championship]], the [[World Senior Chess Championship|World Senior Championship]], the [[Correspondence chess#ICCF World Champions|Correspondence Chess World Championship]], the [[World Computer Chess Championship]], and Blitz and Rapid World Championships (see [[fast chess]]). The [[Chess Olympiad]] is a popular competition among teams from different nations. Online chess has opened amateur and professional competition to a wide and varied group of players. Chess is a [[Olympic sports#Recognized sports|recognized sport]] of the [[International Olympic Committee]], and international chess competition is sanctioned by the [[FIDE]]. Chess is one of the world's most popular games, played by millions of people worldwide at home, in [[Chess club|clubs]], online, by [[correspondence chess|correspondence]], and in [[List of chess terms#Tournament|tournaments]]. Some other popular forms of chess are fast chess and computer chess. There are many [[chess variants]] that have different rules, different pieces, and different boards. These variants include [[blindfold chess]] and [[chess960|Fischer Random Chess/Chess960]].

[[Computer]]s have been used for many years to create [[Computer chess|chess-playing programs]], and their abilities and insights have contributed significantly to modern chess theory. One, [[Deep Blue (chess computer)|Deep Blue]], was the first machine to overcome a reigning World Chess Champion in playing ability when it [[Deep Blue versus Garry Kasparov|defeated]] [[Garry Kasparov]] in 1997.
==Rules==
{{Main|Rules of chess}}
The official rules of chess are maintained by the [[FIDE|World Chess Federation]]. Along with information on official [[chess tournament]]s, the rules are described in the ''FIDE Handbook'',  Laws of Chess section.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}
Chess is played on a square [[Chessboard|board]] of eight rows (called [[rank (chess)|''ranks'']] and denoted with numbers ''1'' to ''8'') and eight columns (called [[file (chess)|''files'']] and denoted with letters ''a'' to ''h'') of squares. The colors of the sixty-four squares alternate and are referred to as &quot;light squares&quot; and &quot;dark squares&quot;. The chessboard is placed with a light square at the right-hand end of the rank nearest to each player, and the pieces are set out as shown in the diagram, with each [[Queen (chess)|queen]] on its own color.

The pieces are divided, by convention, into white and black sets. The players are referred to as [[White and Black in chess|&quot;White&quot; and &quot;Black&quot;]], and each begins the game with sixteen [[Chess piece|pieces]] of the specified color. These consist of one [[king (chess)|king]], one [[queen (chess)|queen]], two [[rook (chess)|rooks]], two [[bishop (chess)|bishops]], two [[knight (chess)|knights]], and eight [[pawn (chess)|pawns]].

===Movement===
White always moves first. After the initial move, the players alternately move one piece at a time (with the exception of ''[[castling]]'', when two pieces are moved). Pieces are moved to either an unoccupied square or one occupied by an opponent's piece, which is captured and removed from play. With the sole exception of ''[[en passant]]'', all pieces capture opponent's pieces by moving to the square that the opponent's piece occupies. A player may not make any move that would put or leave his king under attack. If the player to move has no legal moves, the game is over; it is either a ''[[checkmate]]''—if the king is under attack—or a ''[[stalemate]]''—if the king is not.

Each [[chess piece]] has its own style of moving. In the diagrams, the dots mark the squares where the piece can move if no other pieces (including one's own piece) are on the squares between the piece's initial position and its destination.
* The [[king (chess)|king]] moves ''one'' square in any direction. The king has also a special move which is called [[chess#Castling|''castling'']] and involves also moving a rook.
* The [[rook (chess)|rook]] can move any number of squares along any rank or file, but may not leap over other pieces. Along with the king, the rook is involved during the king's ''castling'' move.
* The [[bishop (chess)|bishop]] can move any number of squares diagonally, but may not leap over other pieces.
* The [[queen (chess)|queen]] combines the power of the rook and bishop and can move any number of squares along rank, file, or diagonal, but it may not leap over other pieces.
* The [[knight (chess)|knight]] moves to any of the closest squares that are ''not'' on the same rank, file, or diagonal, thus the move forms an &quot;L&quot;-shape two squares long and one square wide. The knight is the only piece that can leap over other pieces.
* The [[pawn (chess)|pawn]] may move forward to the unoccupied square immediately in front of it on the same file; or on its first move it may advance two squares along the same file provided both squares are unoccupied; or it may move to a square occupied by an opponent's piece which is diagonally in front of it on an adjacent file, capturing that piece. The pawn has two special moves: the [[chess#En passant|''en passant'']] capture and pawn [[chess#Promotion|promotion]].

&lt;small&gt;* Pawns can optionally move two squares forward instead of one on their first move only. They capture diagonally (black x's); they cannot capture with their normal move (black circles). Pawns are also involved in the special move called ''en passant''.&lt;/small&gt;

===Castling===
[[File:ChessCastlingMovie.gif|thumb|250px|Examples of castling]]
{{Main|Castling}}
Once in every game, each king is allowed to make a special move, known as ''[[castling]]''. Castling consists of moving the king two squares along the first rank toward a rook (which is on the player's first rank{{#tag:ref|Without this additional restriction, which was added to the FIDE rules in 1972, it would be possible to promote a pawn on the ''e'' [[File (chess)|file]] to a rook and then castle vertically across the board (as long as the other conditions are met). This way of castling was &quot;discovered&quot; by Max Pam and used by [[Tim Krabbé]] in a [[Joke chess problem#Offbeat interpretations of the rules of chess|chess puzzle]] before the rules were amended to disallow it. See ''Chess Curiosities'' by Krabbé. See also [[:de:Pam-Krabbé-Rochade]] for the diagrams online.|group=note}}) and then placing the rook on the last square the king has just crossed. Castling is permissible only if all of the following conditions hold:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | title=The rules of chess
 | url=http://www.chessvariants.org/d.chess/chess.html
 | author=Bodlaender, Hans
 | publisher=Chess Variants
 | accessdate=2008-01-07
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Neither of the pieces involved in castling may have been previously moved during the game.
* There must be no pieces between the king and the rook.
* The king may not currently be in check, nor may the king pass through squares that are under attack by enemy pieces, nor move to a square where it is in check.

===''En passant''===
[[File:ChessPawnSpecialMoves.gif|thumb|250px|Examples of pawn moves: promotion (left) and ''en passant'' (right)]]
{{Main|En passant}}
When a pawn advances two squares and there is an opponent's pawn on an adjacent file next to its destination square, then the opponent's pawn can capture it ''en passant'' (in passing), and move to the square the pawn passed over. However, this can only be done on the very next move, or the right to do so is lost. For example, if the black pawn has just advanced two squares from g7 to g5, then the white pawn on f5 can take it via ''en passant'' on g6 (but only on white's next move).

===Promotion===
{{Main|Promotion (chess)}}

When a pawn advances to the eighth rank, as a part of the move it is ''promoted'' and must be exchanged for the player's choice of queen, rook, bishop, or knight of the same color. Usually, the pawn is chosen to be promoted to a queen, but in some cases another piece is chosen (usually a knight); this is  called [[underpromotion]]. In the diagram on the right, the pawn on c7 can be advanced to the eighth rank and be promoted to an allowed piece. There is no restriction placed on the piece that is chosen on promotion, so it is possible to have more pieces of the same type than at the start of the game (for example, two queens).

===Check===
{{Main|Check (chess)}}

When a king is under immediate attack by one or two of the opponent's pieces, it is said to be in [[Check (chess)|''check'']]. A response to a check is a legal move if it results in a position where the king is no longer under direct attack (that is, not in check). This can involve capturing the checking piece; interposing a piece between the checking piece and the king (which is possible only if the attacking piece is a queen, rook, or bishop and there is a square between it and the king); or moving the king to a square where it is not under attack. Castling is not a permissible response to a check. The object of the game is to checkmate the opponent; this occurs when the opponent's king is in check, and there is no legal way to remove it from attack. It is illegal for a player to make a move that would put or leave his own king in check.

===End of the game===
Although the objective of the game is to ''checkmate'' the opponent, chess games do not have to end in checkmate—either player may [[List of chess terms#Resign|resign]] which is a win for the other player. It is considered bad etiquette to continue playing when in a truly hopeless position.&lt;ref&gt;Burgess (2000), p. 481&lt;/ref&gt; If it is a [[time control|timed]] game, a player may run out of time and lose, even with a much superior position. Games also may end in a [[Draw (chess)|draw]] (tie). A draw can occur in several situations, including [[draw by agreement]], [[stalemate]], [[threefold repetition]] of a position, the [[fifty-move rule]], or a draw by impossibility of checkmate (usually because of [[Glossary of chess#Insufficient material|insufficient material]] to checkmate). As checkmate from some positions cannot be forced in fewer than 50 moves (such as in the [[pawnless chess endgame]] and [[two knights endgame]]), the fifty-move rule is not applied everywhere,{{#tag:ref|The 50 moves rule is not applied at FICGS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ficgs.com/membership.html#chess

===Time control===
[[File:Digitalna sahovska ura2.jpg|thumb|A modern digital chess clock]]

Besides casual games without any time restriction, chess is also played with a [[time control]], mostly by club and professional players. If a player's time runs out before the game is completed, the game is automatically lost (provided his opponent has enough pieces left to deliver checkmate). The duration of a game ranges from long games played up to seven hours to shorter [[rapid chess]] games, usually lasting 30 minutes or one hour per game. Even shorter is [[blitz chess]], with a time control of three to fifteen minutes for each player, and [[bullet chess]] (under three minutes). In tournament play, time is controlled using a [[game clock]] that has two displays, one for each player's remaining time.

==Notation for recording moves==
[[File:SCD algebraic notation.png|frame|left|Naming the squares in algebraic chess notation]]
{{Main|Chess notation}}

Chess games and positions are recorded using a special notation, most often [[algebraic chess notation]].&lt;ref&gt;See paragraph &quot;E. Algebraic notation&quot; in {{cite web
 | url=http://www.fide.com/component/handbook/?id=125&amp;view=article
 | title=E.I.01B. Appendices
 | accessdate=2008-11-26
 | publisher=FIDE
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abbreviated (or short) algebraic notation generally records moves in the format &quot;abbreviation of the piece moved – file where it moved – rank where it moved.&quot; For example, ''Qg5'' means &quot;queen moves to the ''g''-file and ''5th'' rank (that is, to the square ''g5''). If there are two pieces of the same type that can move to the same square, one more letter or number is added to indicate the file or rank from which the piece moved, e.g. ''Ngf3'' means &quot;knight from the g-file moves to the square f3&quot;. The letter ''P'' indicating a pawn is not used, so that ''e4'' means &quot;pawn moves to the square ''e4''&quot;.

If the piece makes a capture, &quot;x&quot; is inserted before the destination square. Thus ''Bxf3'' means &quot;bishop captures on f3&quot;. When a pawn makes a capture, the file from which the pawn departed is used in place of a piece initial, and ranks may be omitted if unambiguous. For example, ''exd5'' (pawn on the e-file captures the piece on ''d5'') or ''exd'' (pawn on e-file captures something on the d-file).

[[File:Scholars mate animation.gif|frame|&quot;[[Scholar's mate]]&quot;]]

If a pawn moves to its last rank, achieving promotion, the piece chosen is indicated after the move, for example ''e1Q'' or ''e1=Q''. Castling is indicated by the special notations 0–0 for [[kingside]] castling and 0–0–0 for queenside castling. A move that places the opponent's king in check usually has the notation &quot;+&quot; added. Checkmate can be indicated by &quot;#&quot; (occasionally &quot;++&quot;, although this is sometimes used for a [[double check]] instead). At the end of the game, &quot;1–0&quot; means &quot;White won,&quot; &quot;0–1&quot; means &quot;Black won,&quot; and &quot;½–½&quot; indicates a draw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chess moves can be annotated with [[punctuation (chess)|punctuation marks and other symbols]]. For example ''&quot;!&quot;'' indicates a good move, ''&quot;!!&quot;'' an excellent move,
''&quot;?&quot;'' a mistake, ''&quot;??&quot;'' a blunder, ''&quot;!?&quot;'' an interesting move that may not be best, or ''&quot;?!&quot;'' a dubious move, but not easily refuted.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hooper &amp; Whyld 1992, p. 92&quot;&gt;Hooper &amp; Whyld (1992), p. 92&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, one variant of a simple trap known as the [[Scholar's mate]], animated in the picture to the right, can be recorded:
# e4 e5
# Qh5?! Nc6
# Bc4 Nf6??
# Qxf7# 1–0

==Strategy and tactics==
Chess strategy consists of setting and achieving long-term goals during the game – for example, where to place different pieces – while tactics concentrate on immediate maneuver. These two parts of the chess-playing process cannot be completely separated, because strategic goals are mostly achieved by the means of tactics, while the tactical opportunities are based on the previous strategy of play.

A game of chess is normally divided into three phases: [[Chess opening|opening]], typically the first 10 to 25 moves, when players move their pieces into useful positions for the coming battle; [[Chess middlegame|middlegame]], usually the fiercest part of the game; and [[Chess endgame|endgame]], when most of the pieces are gone, kings typically take a more active part in the struggle, and [[pawn promotion]] is often decisive. The endgame requires a lot of strategy and a thorough understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the pieces left on the board.

In chess, tactics in general concentrate on short-term actions – so short-term that they can be calculated in advance by a human player or by a computer. The possible depth of calculation depends on the player's ability. In quiet positions with many possibilities on both sides, a deep calculation is more difficult and may not be practical, while in &quot;tactical&quot; positions with a limited number of forced variations where much less than the best move would lose quickly, strong players can calculate long sequences of moves.

Simple one-move or two-move tactical actions – threats, exchanges of [[material (chess)|material]], and double attacks – can be combined into more complicated [[Combination (chess)|combinations]], sequences of tactical maneuvers that are often forced from the point of view of one or both players.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harding 2003, p. 70ff&quot;&gt;Harding (2003), p. 70ff&lt;/ref&gt; Theoreticians described many elementary tactical methods and typical maneuvers; for example, [[Pin (chess)|pins]], [[Fork (chess)|forks]], [[Skewer (chess)|skewers]], [[battery (chess)|batteries]], [[discovered attack]]s (especially discovered checks), [[zwischenzug]]s, [[deflection (chess)|deflections]], [[decoy (chess)|decoys]], [[Sacrifice (chess)|sacrifices]], [[undermining (chess)|underminings]], [[Overloading (chess)|overloadings]], and [[Interference (chess)|interferences]].&lt;ref&gt;Harding (2003), p. 8ff&lt;/ref&gt;

A forced variation that involves a sacrifice and usually results in a tangible gain is called a [[combination (chess)|combination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Harding 2003, p. 70ff&quot;/&gt; Brilliant combinations – such as those in the [[Immortal Game]] – are considered beautiful and are admired by chess lovers. A common type of chess exercise, aimed at developing players' skills, is showing players a position where a decisive combination is available and challenging them to find it.&lt;ref&gt;Burgess, Nunn, &amp; Emms (2004), pp. 14–15&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fundamentals of strategy===
{{Main|Chess strategy}}

Chess strategy is concerned with evaluation of chess positions and with setting up goals and long-term plans for the future play. During the evaluation, players must take into account numerous factors such as the value of the pieces on the board, control of the center and centralization, the [[pawn structure]], king safety, and the control of key squares or groups of squares (for example, diagonals, open files, and dark or light squares).

}}
|}
The most basic step in evaluating a position is to count the [[Chess piece relative value|total value of pieces]] of both sides.&lt;ref&gt;Harding (2003), pp. 1–7&lt;/ref&gt; The point values used for this purpose are based on experience; usually pawns are considered worth one point, knights and bishops about three points each, rooks about five points (the value difference between a rook and a bishop or knight being known as [[The exchange (chess)|the exchange]]), and queens about nine points. The king is more valuable than all of the other pieces combined, since its checkmate loses the game. But in practical terms, in the endgame the king as a fighting piece is generally more powerful than a bishop or knight but less powerful than a rook.&lt;ref&gt;Lasker (1934), p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; These basic values are then modified by other factors like position of the piece (for example, advanced pawns are usually more valuable than those on their initial squares), coordination between pieces (for example, a pair of bishops usually coordinate better than a bishop and a knight), or the type of position (knights are generally better in [[Glossary of chess#Closed game|closed positions]] with many pawns while bishops are more powerful in [[Glossary of chess#Open game|open]] positions).&lt;ref&gt;Watson (1998), p. 163ff&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important factor in the evaluation of chess positions is the pawn structure (sometimes known as the pawn skeleton), or the configuration of pawns on the chessboard.&lt;ref&gt;Harding (2003), pp. 138ff&lt;/ref&gt; Since pawns are the least mobile of the chess pieces, the pawn structure is relatively static and largely determines the strategic nature of the position. Weaknesses in the pawn structure, such as [[Isolated pawn|isolated]], [[Doubled pawns|doubled]], or [[backward pawn]]s and [[chess terminology#Hole|holes]], once created, are often permanent. Care must therefore be taken to avoid these weaknesses unless they are compensated by another valuable asset (for example, by the possibility of developing an attack).&lt;ref&gt;Evans (1958), pp. 22–67&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opening===
{{Main|Chess opening}}

A chess opening is the group of initial moves of a game (the &quot;opening moves&quot;). Recognized sequences of opening moves are referred to as ''openings'' and have been given names such as the [[Ruy Lopez]] or [[Sicilian Defence]]. They are catalogued in reference works such as the ''[[Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings]]''. There are dozens of different openings, varying widely in character from quiet positional play (for example, the [[Réti Opening]]) to very aggressive (the [[Latvian Gambit]]). In some opening lines, the exact sequence considered best for both sides has been worked out to more than 30 moves.&lt;ref&gt;Tamburro (2010), p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; Professional players spend years studying openings and continue doing so throughout their careers, as [[Chess theory#Opening theory|opening theory]] continues to evolve.

The fundamental strategic aims of most openings are similar:&lt;ref&gt;Tarrasch (1987)&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Development'': This is the technique of placing the pieces (particularly bishops and knights) on useful squares where they will have an optimal impact on the game.
* ''Control of the center'': Control of the central squares allows pieces to be moved to any part of the board relatively easily, and can also have a cramping effect on the opponent.
* ''King safety'': It is critical to keep the king safe from dangerous possibilities. A correctly timed castling can often enhance this.
* ''[[Pawn structure]]'': Players strive to avoid the creation of pawn weaknesses such as isolated, doubled, or backward pawns, and pawn islands – and to force such weaknesses in the opponent's position.

Most players and [[Chess theory|theoreticians]] consider that White, by virtue of the first move, [[First-move advantage in chess|begins the game with a small advantage]]. This initially gives White the [[initiative (chess)|initiative]].&lt;ref&gt;Evans (1958), p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; Black usually strives to neutralize White's advantage and achieve [[Glossary of chess#Equalise/Equalize|equality]], or to develop [[Glossary of chess#Dynamism|dynamic]] [[List of chess terms#Counterplay|counterplay]] in an unbalanced position.

===Middlegame===
{{Main|Chess middlegame}}

The middlegame is the part of the game which starts after the opening. There is no clear line between the opening and the middlegame, but typically the middlegame will start when most pieces have been developed. (Similarly, there is no clear transition from the middlegame to the endgame;  see [[chess endgame#The start of the endgame|start of the endgame]].) Because the [[Chess theory#Opening theory|opening theory]] has ended, players have to form plans based on the features of the position, and at the same time take into account the tactical possibilities of the position.&lt;ref&gt;Harding (2003), p. 32–151&lt;/ref&gt; The middlegame is the phase in which most [[Combination (chess)|combinations]] occur. Combinations are a series of tactical moves executed to achieve some gain. Middlegame combinations are often connected with an attack against the opponent's king; some typical patterns have their own names; for example, the [[Boden's Mate]] or the [[Lasker - Bauer, Amsterdam, 1889|Lasker–Bauer]] combination.&lt;ref&gt;Hooper &amp; Whyld (1992), p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;

Specific plans or strategic themes will often arise from particular groups of openings which result in a specific type of [[pawn structure]]. An example is the [[Glossary of chess#Minority attack|minority attack]], which is the attack of [[Glossary of chess#queenside|queenside]] pawns against an opponent who has more pawns on the queenside. The study of openings is therefore  connected to the preparation of plans that are typical of the resulting middlegames.&lt;ref&gt;Silman (1998), pp. 202–5&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important strategic question in the middlegame is whether and how to reduce material and transition into an endgame (i.e. [[Chess terms#Simplification|simplify]]). Minor material advantages can generally be transformed into victory only in an endgame, and therefore the stronger side must choose an appropriate way to achieve an ending. Not every reduction of material is good for this purpose; for example, if one side keeps a light-squared bishop and the opponent has a dark-squared one, the transformation into a [[Chess endgame#Bishop and pawn endings|bishops and pawns]] ending is usually advantageous for the weaker side only, because an endgame with [[opposite-colored bishops endgame|bishops on opposite colors]] is likely to be a draw, even with an advantage of a pawn, or sometimes even with a two-pawn advantage.&lt;ref&gt;Hooper &amp; Whyld (1992), p. 373&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Chess endgame}}

The endgame (or ''end game'' or ''ending'') is the stage of the game when there are few pieces left on the board. There are three main strategic differences between earlier stages of the game and endgame:&lt;ref&gt;Harding (2003), p. 187ff&lt;/ref&gt;
* During the endgame, pawns become more important; endgames often revolve around attempting to [[promotion (chess)|promote]] a pawn by advancing it to the eighth rank.
* The king, which has to be protected in the middlegame owing to the threat of checkmate, becomes a strong piece in the endgame. It is often brought to the center of the board where it can protect its own pawns, attack the pawns of opposite color, and hinder movement of the opponent's king.
* [[Zugzwang]], a disadvantage because the player has to make a move, is often a factor in endgames but rarely in other stages of the game. For example, the diagram on the right is zugzwang for both sides, as with Black to move he must play 1...Kb7 and let White promote a pawn after 2.Kd7; and with White to move he must allow a draw by 1.Kc6 stalemate or lose his last pawn by any other legal move.
Endgames can be classified according to the type of pieces that remain on board. [[Checkmate#Basic checkmates|Basic checkmates]] are positions in which one side has only a king and the other side has one or two pieces and can checkmate the opposing king, with the pieces working together with their king. For example, [[king and pawn endgame]]s involve only kings and pawns on one or both sides and the task of the stronger side is to promote one of the pawns. Other more complicated endings are classified according to the pieces on board other than kings, such as the &quot;[[rook and pawn versus rook endgame]]&quot;.

Chess is commonly believed to have originated in northwest [[India]] during the [[Gupta Empire|Gupta empire]],&lt;ref&gt;Leibs (2004), p. 92&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robinson &amp; Estes (1996), p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Murray (1913)&quot;&gt;Murray (1913)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bird (1893), p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; where its early form in the 6th century was known as ''[[chaturanga|caturaṅga]]'' ({{Lang-sa|four divisions [of the military]&amp;nbsp;– [[infantry]], [[cavalry]], [[war elephant|elephants]], and [[chariot]]ry, represented by the pieces that would evolve into the modern pawn, knight, bishop, and rook, respectively}}). The earliest evidence of chess is found in the neighboring [[Sassanid Persia]] around 600, where the game came to be known under the name ''[[chatrang]]''. Chatrang is evoked inside three epic romances written in Pahlavi ([[Middle Persian]]). Chatrang was taken up by the [[Muslim world]] after the [[Islamic conquest of Persia]] (633–644), where it was then named ''[[shatranj]]'', with the pieces largely retaining their Persian names. In Spanish &quot;shatranj&quot; was rendered as ''ajedrez'' (&quot;al-shatranj&quot;), in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] as ''xadrez'', and in [[Greek language|Greek]] as ''zatrikion'' (which comes directly from the  Persian ''chatrang''), but in the rest of Europe it was replaced by versions of the Persian ''shāh'' (&quot;king&quot;), which was familiar as an exclamation and became the English words &quot;[[Check (chess)|check]]&quot; and &quot;chess&quot;.{{#tag:ref|At that time Spanish word would have been written ''axedrez''. The Spanish 'x' was pronounced as English &quot;sh&quot;, as the Portuguese 'x' still is today.  The spelling of ''ajedrez'' changed after [[Spanish orthography#Older_conventions|Spanish lost the &quot;sh&quot; sound]].|group=note}} Murray theorized that Muslim traders came to European seaports with ornamental chess kings as curios before they brought the game of chess.&lt;ref name=&quot;Murray (1913)&quot;/&gt;

The game reached Western Europe and Russia by at least three routes, the earliest being in the 9th century. By the year 1000 it had spread throughout Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hooper &amp; Whyld (1992), pp. 173–75&quot;&gt;Hooper &amp; Whyld (1992), pp. 173–75&lt;/ref&gt; Introduced into the [[Iberian Peninsula]] by the [[Moors]] in the 10th century, it was described in a famous 13th-century manuscript covering shatranj, [[backgammon]], and [[dice]] named the ''[[Libro de los juegos]]''. Another theory contends that chess arose from the game [[xiangqi]] (Chinese Chess) or one of its predecessors,&lt;ref&gt;Li (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; although this has been contested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Banaschak| first = Peter | title = A story well told is not necessarily true : a critical assessment of David H.

===Origins of the modern game (1000–1850)===
[[File:Lucena1497.jpg|thumb|left|A tactical puzzle from [[Luis Ramirez de Lucena|Lucena's]] 1497 book]]

Around 1200, the rules of shatranj started to be modified in southern Europe, and around 1475, several major changes made the game essentially as it is known today.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hooper &amp; Whyld (1992), pp. 173–75&quot;/&gt; These modern rules for the basic moves had been adopted in Italy and Spain.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson (1949), p. 13–17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;nauiua&quot;&gt;{{cite web

Pawns gained the option of advancing two squares on their first move, while bishops and queens acquired their modern abilities. The [[Queen (chess)|queen]] replaced the earlier [[Vizier#Influence on chess|vizier]] chess piece towards the end of the 10th century and by the 15th century had become the most powerful piece;&lt;ref&gt;Yalom (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; consequently modern chess was referred to as &quot;Queen's Chess&quot; or &quot;Mad Queen Chess&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Weissberger (2004), pp. 152ff&lt;/ref&gt; These new rules quickly spread throughout western Europe.

Writings about the [[chess theory|theory]] of how to play chess began to appear in the 15th century. The ''Repetición de Amores y Arte de Ajedrez'' (''Repetition of Love and the Art of Playing Chess'') by [[Spanish people|Spanish]] churchman [[Luis Ramirez de Lucena]] was published in [[Salamanca]] in 1497.&lt;ref name = &quot;nauiua&quot;/&gt; Lucena and later masters like [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[Pedro Damiano]], [[Italians]] [[Giovanni Leonardo Di Bona]], [[Giulio Cesare Polerio]] and [[Gioachino Greco]], and Spanish bishop [[Ruy López de Segura]] developed elements of [[Chess opening|opening]]s and started to analyze simple [[Chess endgame|endgames]].
[[File:André Philidor.jpg|thumb|caption|[[François-André Danican Philidor]], 18th-century French chess master]]
In the 18th century, the center of European chess life moved from the Southern European countries to France. The two most important French masters were [[François-André Danican Philidor]], a musician by profession, who discovered the importance of pawns for chess strategy, and later [[Louis-Charles Mahé de La Bourdonnais]], who won a famous series of matches with the [[Irish people|Irish]] master [[Alexander McDonnell]] in 1834.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

As the 19th century progressed, chess organization developed quickly. Many [[chess club]]s, chess books, and chess journals appeared. There were correspondence matches between cities; for example, the London Chess Club played against the [[Edinburgh]] Chess Club in 1824.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chess problems]] became a regular part of 19th-century newspapers; [[Bernhard Horwitz]], [[Josef Kling]], and [[Samuel Loyd]] composed some of the most influential problems. In 1843, [[Tassilo von Heydebrand und der Lasa|von der Lasa]] published his and [[Paul Rudolf von Bilguer|Bilguer's]] ''[[Handbuch des Schachspiels]]'' (''Handbook of Chess''), the first comprehensive manual of chess theory.

===Birth of a sport (1850–1945)===
[[File:immortal game animation.gif|frame|left|The &quot;[[Immortal Game]]&quot;, Anderssen-Kieseritzky, 1851]]
The first modern chess tournament was [[London 1851 chess tournament|held in London in 1851]] and was won by German [[Adolf Anderssen]], relatively unknown at the time. Anderssen was hailed as the leading chess master and his brilliant, energetic attacking style became typical for the time, although it was later regarded as [[chess strategy|strategically]] shallow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hartston (1985), p.36&lt;/ref&gt; Sparkling games like Anderssen's ''[[Immortal game]]'' and ''[[Evergreen game]]'' or [[Paul Morphy|Morphy's]] ''[[Opera game]]'' were regarded as the highest possible summit of the chess art.&lt;ref&gt;Burgess, Nunn, &amp; Emms (2004) p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

Deeper insight into the nature of chess came with two younger players. American [[Paul Morphy]], an extraordinary [[chess prodigy]], won against all important competitors (except [[Howard Staunton]], who refused to play), including Anderssen, during his short chess career between 1857 and 1863. Morphy's success stemmed from a combination of brilliant attacks and sound strategy; he intuitively knew how to prepare attacks.&lt;ref&gt;Shibut (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Prague]]-born [[Wilhelm Steinitz]] later described how to avoid weaknesses in one's own position and how to create and exploit such weaknesses in the opponent's position.&lt;ref&gt;Steinitz (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; The scientific approach and positional understanding of Steinitz revolutionized the game. Steinitz was the first to break a position down into its components.&lt;ref&gt;Kasparov (2003a), p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Before Steinitz, players brought their queen out early, did not completely [[development (chess)|develop]] their other pieces, and mounted a quick attack on the opposing king, which either succeeded or failed. The level of defense was poor and players did not form any deep plan.&lt;ref&gt;Kasparov (2003a), p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to his theoretical achievements, Steinitz founded an important tradition: his triumph over the leading German master [[Johannes Zukertort]] in 1886 is regarded as the first official [[World Chess Championship]]. Steinitz lost his crown in 1894 to a much younger player, the German mathematician [[Emanuel Lasker]], who maintained this title for 27 years, the longest tenure of all World Champions.&lt;ref&gt;Kasparov (1983a), p. 117&lt;/ref&gt;

It took a prodigy from [[Cuba]], [[José Raúl Capablanca]] (World Champion 1921–27), who loved simple positions and endgames, to end the German-speaking dominance in chess; he was undefeated in tournament play for eight years, until 1924. His successor was Russian-French [[Alexander Alekhine]], a strong attacking player who died as the World champion in 1946. He briefly lost the title to [[Dutch people|Dutch]] player [[Max Euwe]] in 1935 and regained it two years later.&lt;ref&gt;Kasparov (1983b), p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

Between the world wars, chess was revolutionized by the new theoretical school of so-called [[Hypermodernism (chess)|hypermodernists]] like [[Aron Nimzowitsch]] and [[Richard Réti]]. They advocated controlling the center of the board with distant pieces rather than with pawns, which invited opponents to occupy the center with pawns, which become objects of attack.&lt;ref&gt;Hooper &amp; Whyld (1992), p. 178&lt;/ref&gt;

After the end of the 19th century, the number of master tournaments and matches held annually quickly grew. Some sources state that in 1914 the title of [[International Grandmaster|chess grandmaster]] was first formally conferred by Tsar [[Nicholas II of Russia]] to Lasker, Capablanca, Alekhine, [[Siegbert Tarrasch|Tarrasch]], and [[Frank Marshall (chess player)|Marshall]], but this is a disputed claim.{{#tag:ref|This is stated in ''The Encyclopaedia of Chess'' (1970, p.223) by [[Anne Sunnucks]], but is disputed by [[Edward Winter (chess historian)]] in his [http://www.chesshistory.com/winter/winter38.html Chess Notes 5144 and 5152].|group=note}} The tradition of awarding such titles was continued by the World Chess Federation ([[FIDE]]), founded in 1924 in Paris. In 1927, the [[Women's World Chess Championship]] was established; the first to hold the title was [[Czech people|Czech]]-English master [[Vera Menchik]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Post-war era (1945 and later)===
&lt;!-- [[File:Capablanca-Lasker 1925.jpg|thumb|left|World Champions [[José Raúl Capablanca]] (left) and [[Emanuel Lasker]] in 1925]] --&gt;
After the death of Alekhine, a new World Champion was sought. FIDE, who have controlled the title since then (except for one interruption), ran a tournament of elite players. The winner of the [[World Chess Championship 1948|1948 tournament]], Russian [[Mikhail Botvinnik]], started an era of [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] dominance in the chess world. Until the end of the Soviet Union, there was only one non-Soviet champion, American [[Bobby Fischer]] (champion 1972–1975).&lt;ref&gt;Kasparov (2003b), pp. 7–8&lt;/ref&gt; Botvinnik revolutionized opening theory. Previously Black strove for equality, to neutralize White's [[first-move advantage in chess|first-move advantage]]. As Black, Botvinnik strove for the initiative from the beginning.&lt;ref&gt;Kasparov (2003b), p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; In the previous informal system of World Championships, the current champion decided which challenger he would play for the title and the challenger was forced to seek sponsors for the match. FIDE set up a new system of qualifying tournaments and matches. The world's strongest players were seeded into [[Interzonal]] tournaments, where they were joined by players who had qualified from Zonal tournaments. The leading finishers in these Interzonals would go on the &quot;[[Candidates Tournament|Candidates]]&quot; stage, which was initially a tournament, and later a series of knock-out matches. The winner of the Candidates would then play the reigning champion for the title. A champion defeated in a match had a right to play a rematch a year later. This system operated on a three-year cycle. Botvinnik participated in championship matches over a period of fifteen years. He won the world championship tournament in 1948 and retained the title in tied matches in 1951 and 1954. In 1957, he lost to [[Vasily Smyslov]], but regained the title in a rematch in 1958. In 1960, he lost the title to the 23-year-old [[Latvia]]n prodigy [[Mikhail Tal]], an accomplished [[Chess tactics|tactician]] and attacking player. Botvinnik again regained the title in a rematch in 1961.

Following the 1961 event, FIDE abolished the automatic right of a deposed champion to a rematch, and the next champion, [[Armenia]]n [[Tigran Petrosian]], a genius of defense and a strong [[Positional chess|positional]] player, held the title for two cycles, 1963–1969. His successor, [[Boris Spassky]] from Russia (champion 1969–1972), was able to win in both positional and sharp tactical style.&lt;ref&gt;Kasparov (2004a), pp, 5–6; Kasparov (2003b), p, 8&lt;/ref&gt; The next championship, the so-called [[World Chess Championship 1972|Match of the Century]], saw the first non-Soviet challenger since World War II, American [[Bobby Fischer]], who defeated his Candidates opponents by unheard-of margins and clearly won the world championship match. In 1975, however, Fischer refused to defend his title against Soviet [[Anatoly Karpov]] when FIDE did not meet his demands, and Karpov obtained the title by default.&lt;ref&gt;Kasparov (2004b), pp. 5–6&lt;/ref&gt; Fischer modernized many aspects of chess, especially by extensively preparing openings.&lt;ref&gt;Kasparov (2003a), p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

Karpov defended his title twice against [[Viktor Korchnoi]] and dominated the 1970s and early 1980s with a string of tournament successes.&lt;ref&gt;Kasparov (2004b), pp. 5–6; Kasparov (2006), pp. 5–6&lt;/ref&gt; Karpov's reign finally ended in 1985 at the hands of [[Garry Kasparov]], another Soviet player from [[Baku]], [[Azerbaijan]]. Kasparov and Karpov contested five world title matches between 1984 and 1990; Karpov never won his title back.&lt;ref&gt;Keene (1993), p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, Garry Kasparov and [[Nigel Short]] broke with FIDE to organize their own match for the title and formed a competing [[Professional Chess Association]] (PCA). From then until 2006, there were two simultaneous World Champions and World Championships: the PCA or Classical champion extending the Steinitzian tradition in which the current champion plays a challenger in a series of many games, and the other following FIDE's new format of many players competing in a tournament to determine the champion. Kasparov lost his Classical title in [[Classical World Chess Championship 2000|2000]] to [[Vladimir Kramnik]] of Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

{{Main|Chess in the arts and literature}}

===Pre-modern===
In the [[Middle Ages]] and during the [[Renaissance]], chess was a part of [[Nobility|noble]] culture; it was used to teach war strategy and was dubbed the &quot;[[Chess or the King's Game|King's Game]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Vale (2001), pp. 170–99&lt;/ref&gt; Gentlemen are &quot;to be meanly seene in the play at Chestes&quot;, says the overview at the beginning of [[Baldassare Castiglione]]'s ''[[The Book of the Courtier]]'' (1528, English 1561 by Sir Thomas Hoby), but chess should not be a gentleman's main passion. Castiglione explains it further:

&lt;blockquote&gt;And what say you to the game at chestes?

It is truely&lt;!--sic--&gt; an honest kynde of enterteynmente and wittie, quoth Syr Friderick. But me think it hath a fault, whiche is, that a man may be to couning at it, for who ever will be excellent in the playe of chestes, I beleave he must beestowe much tyme about it, and applie it with so much study, that a man may assoone learne some noble scyence, or compase any other matter of importaunce, and yet in the ende in beestowing all that laboure, he knoweth no more but a game. Therfore in this I beleave there happeneth a very rare thing, namely, that the meane is more commendable, then the excellency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

[[File:UigChessmen SelectionOfKings.jpg|thumb|left|Two kings and two queens from the [[Lewis chessmen]] at the [[British Museum]] ]]

Many of the elaborate chess sets used by the aristocracy have been lost, but others partially survive, such as the [[Lewis chessmen]].

Chess was often used as a basis of sermons on [[morality]]. An example is ''Liber de moribus hominum et officiis nobilium sive super ludo scacchorum'' ('Book of the customs of men and the duties of nobles or the Book of Chess'), written by an Italian [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] monk [[Jacobus de Cessolis]] c. 1300. This book was one of the most popular of the Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;Olmert (1996), p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; The work was translated into many other languages (the first printed edition was published at Utrecht in 1473) and was the basis for [[William Caxton]]'s ''The Game and Playe of the Chesse'' (1474), one of the first books printed in English.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/212/1303.html The Introduction of Printing into England and the Early Work of the Press: The First Book printed in English], from ''[[The Cambridge History of English and American Literature]]'', Vol II. (1907) Online at bartleby.com. Retrieved 12 December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Different chess pieces were used as metaphors for different classes of people, and human duties were derived from the rules of the game or from visual properties of the chess pieces:&lt;ref&gt;Adams (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Known in the circles of clerics, students, and merchants, chess entered into the popular culture of Middle Ages. An example is the 209th song of [[Carmina Burana]] from the 13th century, which starts with the names of chess pieces, ''Roch, pedites, regina...''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Modern===
During the [[Age of Enlightenment]], chess was viewed as a means of self-improvement. [[Benjamin Franklin]], in his article &quot;The Morals of Chess&quot; (1750), wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;The Game of Chess is not merely an idle amusement; several very valuable qualities of the mind, useful in the course of human life, are to be acquired and strengthened by it, so as to become habits ready on all occasions; for life is a kind of Chess, in which we have often points to gain, and competitors or adversaries to contend with, and in which there is a vast variety of good and ill events, that are, in some degree, the effect of prudence, or the want of it. By playing at Chess then, we may learn:

'''I. Foresight''', which looks a little into futurity, and considers the consequences that may attend an action [...]

'''II. Circumspection''', which surveys the whole Chess-board, or scene of action: – the relation of the several Pieces, and their situations [...]

'''III. Caution''', not to make our moves too hastily [...]&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Franklin (1779)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Red King sleeping.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]'': the Red King is snoring. Illustration by [[John Tenniel]] ]]
With these or similar hopes, chess is taught to children in schools around the world today. Many schools host chess clubs, and there are many scholastic tournaments specifically for children. Tournaments are held regularly in many countries, hosted by organizations such as the [[United States Chess Federation]] and the National Scholastic Chess Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[File:Chess Large.JPG|thumb|250px|right|A Large sized Chess game is made available on a seasonal basis inside the [[Enoch Pratt Free Library]] in [[Baltimore]], Maryland]]
Chess is often depicted in the [[arts]]; significant works where chess plays a key role range from Thomas Middleton's ''[[A Game at Chess]]'' to ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]'' by Lewis Carroll to ''[[The Royal Game]]'' by Stefan Zweig and Vladimir Nabokov's ''[[The Defense]]''. The [[Thriller(genre)|thriller]] film ''[[Knight Moves]]'' is about a chess grandmaster who is accused of being a [[serial killer]]. Chess is featured in films like Ingmar Bergman's ''[[The Seventh Seal]]'' and Satyajit Ray's ''[[The Chess Players]]''.

In the [[video game]] ''[[Killer 7]]'', the protagonist and the antagonist frequently play chess together; in the [[survival horror]] game ''[[Deadly Premonition]]'', chess is the theme of a puzzle.

Chess is also present in the contemporary popular culture. For example, J. K. Rowling's [[Harry Potter]] plays &quot;[[Magical_objects_in_Harry_Potter#Wizard.27s_Chess|Wizard's Chess]]&quot;, while the characters of ''[[Star Trek]]'' prefer &quot;[[Tri-dimensional chess|Tri-Dimensional Chess]]&quot;. The hero of ''[[Searching for Bobby Fischer]]'' struggles against adopting the [[aggressive]] and [[misanthropic]] views of a real chess grandmaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Chess composition==
{{Main|Chess problem}}

Chess composition is the art of creating chess problems (the problems themselves are sometimes also called chess compositions). A person who creates such problems is known as a [[chess composer]].&lt;ref&gt;Howard (1961)&lt;/ref&gt; There are many types of chess problems. The two most important are:
* '''Directmates''': white to move first and checkmate black within a specified number of moves against any defense. These are often referred to as &quot;mate in ''n''&quot; – for example &quot;mate in three&quot; (a ''three-mover'').&lt;ref&gt;Hooper &amp; Whyld (1992), p. 110&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Endgame study|Studies]]''': orthodox problems in which the stipulation is that white to play must win or draw. Almost all studies are [[Chess endgame|endgame]] positions.&lt;ref&gt;Hooper &amp; Whyld (1992), pp. 400–401&lt;/ref&gt;

Chess composition is a distinct branch of chess sport, and tournaments (or ''tourneys'') exist for both the composition and solving of chess problems.&lt;ref&gt;Weenink (1926)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Réti endgame study}}
This is one of the most famous chess studies; it was published by [[Richard Réti]] in 1921. It seems impossible to catch the advanced black pawn, while the black king can easily stop the white pawn. The solution is a [[diagonal]] advance, which brings the king to ''both'' pawns at the same time: 1.Kg7! h4 2.Kf6! Kb6 (or 2...h3 3.Ke7 and the white king can support its pawn) 3. Ke5!! (now the white king comes just in time to support his pawn, or catch the black one) 3...h3 4. Kd6 draw.&lt;ref&gt;de la Villa (2008), pp.179–80&lt;/ref&gt;

==Competitive play==
===Organization of competitions===
Contemporary chess is an organized sport with structured international and national leagues, tournaments, and [[congress]]es. Chess's international governing body is [[FIDE]] (Fédération Internationale des Échecs). Most countries have a national chess organization as well (such as the [[United States Chess Federation|US Chess Federation]] and [[English Chess Federation]]) which in turn is a member of FIDE. FIDE is a member of the [[International Olympic Committee]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Other competitions for individuals include the [[World Junior Chess Championship]], the [[European Individual Chess Championship]], and the [[List of national chess championships|National Chess Championships]]. Invitation-only tournaments regularly attract the world's strongest players.  Examples include Spain's [[Linares chess tournament|Linares]] event, Monte Carlo's [[Melody Amber]] tournament, the [[Dortmund Sparkassen Chess Meeting|Dortmund Sparkassen]] meeting, Sofia's [[M-tel Masters]], and Wijk aan Zee's [[Tata Steel Chess Tournament|Tata Steel]] tournament.

Regular team chess events include the [[Chess Olympiad]] and the [[European Team Championship]]. The [[38th Chess Olympiad]] was held 2008 in [[Dresden]], Germany; [[Armenia]] won the gold in the unrestricted event for the second time in a row after [[37th Chess Olympiad|Turin 2006]], and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] took the top medal for the women. The [[World Chess Solving Championship]] and World [[Correspondence Chess]] Championships include both team and individual events.

Besides these prestigious competitions, there are thousands of other chess tournaments, matches, and festivals held around the world every year catering to players of all levels. Chess is promoted as a &quot;mind sport&quot; by the [[Mind Sports Organisation]], alongside other [[mental-skill game]]s such as [[Contract Bridge]], [[Go (board game)|Go]], and [[Scrabble]].

===Titles and rankings===
{{Main|Chess titles}}

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Grandmaster (chess)|Grandmaster]]'' (shortened as GM; sometimes ''International Grandmaster'' or IGM is used) is awarded to world-class chess masters. Apart from World Champion, Grandmaster is the highest title a chess player can attain. Before FIDE will confer the title on a player, the player must have an [[Elo rating system|Elo chess rating]] (see below) of at least 2500 at one time and three favorable results (called norms) in tournaments involving other Grandmasters, including some from countries other than the applicant's. There are other milestones a player can achieve to attain the title, such as winning the World Junior Championship.
* ''[[International Master]]'' (shortened as IM). The conditions are similar to GM, but less demanding. The minimum rating for the IM title is 2400.
* ''[[FIDE Master]]'' (shortened as FM). The usual way for a player to qualify for the FIDE Master title is by achieving a FIDE rating of 2300 or more.
* ''[[Candidate Master]]'' (shortened as CM). Similar to FM, but with a FIDE rating of at least 2200.
All the titles are open to men and women. Separate women-only titles, such as Woman Grandmaster (WGM), are available. Beginning with [[Nona Gaprindashvili]] in 1978, a number of women have earned the GM title, and most of the top ten women in 2006 hold the unrestricted GM title.&lt;ref group=note name=&quot;FIDE_top_players&quot;&gt;Current FIDE lists of top players with their titles are online at {{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

International titles are awarded to composers and solvers of chess problems and to correspondence chess players (by the [[International Correspondence Chess Federation]]). National chess organizations may also award titles, usually to the advanced players still under the level needed for international titles; an example is the [[Chess expert]] title used in the United States.

In order to rank players, FIDE, [[International Correspondence Chess Federation|ICCF]], and national chess organizations use the [[Elo rating system]] developed by [[Arpad Elo]]. Elo is a [[Statistical model|statistical system]] based on the assumption that the chess performance of each player in their games is a random variable. Arpad Elo thought of a player's true skill as the average of that player's performance random variable, and showed how to estimate the average from results of player's games. The [[US Chess Federation]] implemented Elo's suggestions in 1960, and the system quickly gained recognition as being both fairer and more accurate than older systems; it was adopted by FIDE in 1970.{{#tag:ref|For the official process see {{cite web

The game structure and nature of chess is related to several branches of mathematics. Many [[combinatorics|combinatorical]] and [[topology|topological]] problems connected to chess were known of for hundreds of years. In 1913, [[Ernst Zermelo]] used chess as a basis for his theory of game strategies, which is considered as one of the predecessors of [[game theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Zermelo, Ernst (1913), Uber eine Anwendung der Mengenlehre auf die Theorie des Schachspiels, Proceedings of the Fifth International Congress of Mathematicians 2, 501–4.

Retrieved 2007-03-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of legal positions in chess is estimated to be between 10&lt;sup&gt;43&lt;/sup&gt; and 10&lt;sup&gt;47&lt;/sup&gt; (a provable upper bound&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = John's Chess Playground | author = John Tromp | year = 2010 | url = http://www.cwi.nl/~tromp/chess/chess.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;), with a [[game-tree complexity]] of approximately 10&lt;sup&gt;123&lt;/sup&gt;. The game-tree complexity of chess was first calculated by [[Claude Shannon]] as 10&lt;sup&gt;120&lt;/sup&gt;, a number known as the [[Shannon number]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Chess.html Chess.] ''Mathworld.Wolfram.com''. Retrieved 2006-12-05.&lt;/ref&gt; Typically an average position has thirty to forty possible moves, but there may be as few as zero (in the case of checkmate or stalemate) or as many as 218.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The most important mathematical challenge of chess is the development of [[algorithm]]s that can play chess. The idea of creating a chess-playing machine dates to the 18th century; around 1769, the chess-playing [[automaton]] called [[The Turk]] became famous before being exposed as a [[hoax]].&lt;ref&gt;Levitt (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; Serious trials based on automatons, such as [[El Ajedrecista]], were too complex and limited to be useful.

Since the advent of the [[digital computer]] in the 1950s, chess enthusiasts and [[computer engineer]]s have built, with increasing degrees of seriousness and success, chess-playing machines and computer programs. The groundbreaking paper on computer chess, &quot;Programming a Computer for Playing Chess,&quot; was published in 1950 by Shannon.{{#tag:ref|[[Alan Turing]] made an attempt in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The chess machine is an ideal one to start with, since: (1) the problem is sharply defined both in allowed operations (the moves) and in the ultimate goal (checkmate); (2) it is neither so simple as to be trivial nor too difficult for satisfactory solution; (3) chess is generally considered to require &quot;thinking&quot; for skillful play; a solution of this problem will force us either to admit the possibility of a mechanized thinking or to further restrict our concept of &quot;thinking&quot;; (4) the discrete structure of chess fits well into the digital nature of
modern computers.&lt;ref&gt;Shannon, Claude E. XXII. Programming a Computer for Playing Chess. ''Philosophical Magazine'', Ser.7, Vol. 41, No. 314 – March 1950.

The [[Association for Computing Machinery]] (ACM) held the first major chess tournament for computers, the [[North American Computer Chess Championship]], in September 1970. [[Chess (Northwestern University)|CHESS 3.0]], a chess program from [[Northwestern University]], won the championship. Nowadays, chess programs compete in the [[World Computer Chess Championship]], held annually since 1974. At first considered only a curiosity, the best [[chess engine|chess playing programs]], for example [[Rybka]], have become extremely strong. In 1997, a computer won a chess match against a reigning World Champion for the first time: [[International Business Machines|IBM's]] [[IBM Deep Blue|Deep Blue]] beat [[Garry Kasparov]] 3½–2½ (it scored two wins, one loss, and three [[draw (chess)|draws]]).&lt;ref&gt;Hsu (2002), pp. 295–6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://researchweb.watson.ibm.com/deepblue/watch/html/c.shtml Deep Blue – Kasparov Match]. ''research.ibm.com''. Retrieved 2006-11-30.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, a [[mobile phone]] won a [[Category (chess tournament)|category]] 6 tournament with a performance rating 2898: chess engine [[Hiarcs]] 13 running on the mobile phone [[HTC Touch HD]] won the Copa Mercosur tournament with nine wins and one draw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The best chess programs are now able to beat the strongest human players.

With huge databases of past games and high analytical ability, computers can help players to learn chess and prepare for matches. [[Internet Chess Server]]s allow people to find and play opponents all over the world. The presence of computers and modern communication tools have raised concerns regarding [[cheating]] during games, most notably the &quot;[[FIDE World Chess Championship 2006#Bathroom controversy|bathroom controversy]]&quot; during the 2006 World Championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/08/sports/othersports/08chess.html|title=Cheating Accusations in Mental Sports, Too|accessdate=2010-08-28 | work=The New York Times | date=2006-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chess playing programs have also been developed that are downloadable from the internet, and allow the user to use his own PC to play chess against the machine.  This reference&lt;ref&gt;http://rjwagner49.com/Robotics/Software/Applet/Chess/&lt;/ref&gt; is one such program developed by a [[computer scientist]] that plays fairly well (roughly 1600-1800).  A listing of other downloadable software can be found here.&lt;ref&gt;http://computer-chess.org/doku.php?id=computer_chess:wiki:lists:native_engine_list&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychology==
There is an extensive scientific literature on chess psychology.{{#tag:ref|A survey is given in [http://jeays.net/files/psychchess.htm Mark Jeays, &quot;A brief survey of psychological studies of chess&quot;].|group=note}}{{#tag:ref|Chess is even called the &quot;[[drosophila]]&quot; of [[cognitive psychology]] and artificial intelligence ([[AI]]) studies, because it represents the domain in which expert performance has been most intensively studied and measured.&lt;ref&gt;Grabner, Stern, &amp; Neubauer (2007) pp. 398–420&lt;/ref&gt;|group=note}}&lt;ref&gt;De Groot &amp; Gobet (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gobet, de Voogt, &amp; Retschitzki (2004)
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holding (1985)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Saariluoma (1995)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alfred Binet]] and others showed that [[knowledge]] and verbal, rather than visuospatial, ability lies at the core of expertise.&lt;ref&gt;Binet (1894)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robbins (1996), pp. 83–93&lt;/ref&gt; In his doctoral thesis, [[Adriaan de Groot]] showed that chess masters can rapidly perceive the key features of a position.&lt;ref&gt;de Groot (1946)&lt;/ref&gt; According to de Groot, this [[perception]], made possible by years of practice and study, is more important than the sheer ability to anticipate moves. De Groot showed that chess masters can memorize positions shown for a few seconds almost perfectly. The ability to memorize does not alone account for chess-playing skill, since masters and novices, when faced with random arrangements of chess pieces, had equivalent recall (about half a dozen positions in each case). Rather, it is the ability to recognize patterns, which are then memorized, which distinguished the skilled players from the novices. When the positions of the pieces were taken from an actual game, the masters had almost total positional recall.&lt;ref&gt;Richards J. Heuer, Jr. ''Psychology of Intelligence Analysis'' Center for the Study of Intelligence, Central Intelligence Agency 1999 (see [https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/books-and-monographs/psychology-of-intelligence-analysis/art6.html Chapter 3]).&lt;/ref&gt;

More recent research has focused on [[chess as mental training]]; the respective roles of knowledge and look-ahead search; [[brain imaging]] studies of chess masters and novices; [[blindfold chess]]; the role of [[Personality psychology|personality]] and [[intelligence]] in chess skill; gender differences; and computational models of chess expertise. The role of practice and talent in the development of chess and other domains of expertise has led to a lot of research recently. Ericsson and colleagues have argued that deliberate practice is sufficient for reaching high levels of expertise in chess.&lt;ref&gt;Ericsson, K. A., Krampe, R. Th., &amp; Tesch-Römer, C. (1993). {{PDFlink| [http://web.archive.org/web/19960101-re_/http://www.freakonomics.com/pdf/DeliberatePractice%28PsychologicalReview%29.pdf The role of deliberate practice in the acquisition of expert performance.] |1.25&amp;nbsp;MB}} ''Psychological Review'', 100, 363–406. Retrieved 2010-05-20.&lt;/ref&gt; Recent research indicates that factors other than practice are also important. For example, Gobet and colleagues have shown that stronger players start playing chess earlier, that they are more likely to be left-handed, and that they are more likely to be born in late winter and early spring.&lt;ref&gt;Gobet, F. &amp; Chassy, P. (in press). {{PDFlink| [http://bura.brunel.ac.uk/bitstream/2438/736/1/Seasonality%20and%20chess.pdf Season of birth and chess expertise.] |65.8&amp;nbsp;KB}} ''Journal of Biosocial Science''. &lt;br&gt; Gobet, F. &amp; Campitelli, G.

==Variants==
{{Main|Chess variant}}
[[File:Glinski Chess Setup.png|thumb|Glinski's [[hexagonal chess]] was popular in the 1930s.]]
Chess variants are forms of chess where the game is played with a different board, special [[Fairy chess piece|fairy pieces]], or different rules. There are more than two thousand published chess variants, the most popular being [[xiangqi]] in China and [[shogi]] in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Pritchard (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pritchard (1994)&lt;/ref&gt; Chess variants include:
* Direct predecessors of chess ([[chaturanga]] and [[shatranj]])
* Traditional national or regional chess variants like [[xiangqi]], [[shogi]], [[janggi]], and [[makruk]], which share common predecessors with Western chess
* Modern variants of chess, such as ''[[Chess960]]'', where the initial position is one [[Chess960#Rules|selected randomly]] from a possible 960 starting positions. This random positioning makes it more difficult to prepare the opening play in advance.&lt;ref&gt;Verwer (2010), p. 63&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sir Charles Spencer &quot;Charlie&quot; Chaplin''', [[Order of the British Empire|KBE]] (16 April 1889{{ndash}} 25 December 1977) was an [[English people|English]] [[comic actor]], [[film director]] and [[composer]] best-known for his work during the [[silent film]] era.&lt;ref&gt;Obituary ''[[Variety Obituaries|Variety]]'', 28 December 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; He became one of the most famous film stars in the world before the end of [[World War I]]. Chaplin used [[Mime artist|mime]], [[slapstick]] and other [[visual gag|visual comedy]] routines, and continued well into the era of the [[talkies]], though his films decreased in frequency from the end of the 1920s. His most famous role was that of [[The Tramp]], which he first played in the [[Keystone Studios|Keystone]] comedy ''[[Kid Auto Races at Venice]]'' in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Blanke|first=David|title=The 1910s|accessdate=21 June 2010|edition=illustrated|series=American popular culture through history|year=2002|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|location=Westport, CT|isbn=978-0-313-31251-9|page=226}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the April 1914 [[one-reeler]] ''[[Twenty Minutes of Love]]'' onwards he was writing and directing most of his films, by 1916 he was also producing them, and from 1918 he was even composing the music for them. With [[Mary Pickford]], [[Douglas Fairbanks]] and [[D. W. Griffith]], he co-founded [[United Artists]] in 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Haupert|first=Michael|title=The Entertainment Industry|year=2006|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|location=Westport, CT|isbn=978-0-313-32173-3|page=242}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chaplin was one of the most creative and influential personalities of the silent-film era. He was influenced by his predecessor, the French silent film comedian [[Max Linder]], to whom he dedicated one of his films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kelly|first=Shawna|title=Aviators in Early Hollywood|accessdate=21 June 2010|edition=illustrated|year=2008|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|location=Mount Pleasant, SC|isbn=978-0-7385-5902-5|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; His working life in entertainment spanned over 75 years, from the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] stage and the [[Music Hall]] in the United Kingdom as a child performer, until close to his death at the age of 88. His high-profile public and private life encompassed both adulation and controversy. Chaplin's identification with [[leftism|the left]] ultimately forced him to resettle in Europe during the [[McCarthy era]] in the early 1950s.

In 1999, the [[American Film Institute]] ranked Chaplin the 10th [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Stars|greatest male screen legend of all time]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afi.com/tvevents/100years/stars.aspx|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080822055357/http://www.afi.com/tvevents/100years/stars.aspx|archivedate=22 August 2008|title=AFI's 100 YEARS...100 STARS|date=Wed, 16 June 1999|publisher=American Film Institute|accessdate=4 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, Martin Sieff, in a review of the book ''[[Chaplin: A Life]]'', wrote: &quot;Chaplin was not just 'big', he was gigantic. In 1915, he burst onto a war-torn world bringing it the gift of comedy, laughter and relief while it was tearing itself apart through World War I. Over the next 25 years, through the [[Great Depression]] and the rise of [[Adolf Hitler]], he stayed on the job.&amp;nbsp;... It is doubtful any individual has ever given more entertainment, pleasure and relief to so many human beings when they needed it the most&quot;.&lt;ref name=Sieff&gt;Sieff, Martin.[http://washingtontimes.com/news/2008/dec/21/his-gift-of-comedy-for-a-weary-world/ ''Washington Times -Books''] 21 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Bernard Shaw]] called Chaplin &quot;the only genius to come out of the movie industry&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/news/the-big-question-does-charlie-chaplin-merit-a-museum-in-his-honour-and-what-is-his-legacy-1826871.html |title=The Big Question: Does Charlie Chaplin merit a museum in his honour, and what is his legacy? – News, People |publisher=The Independent |date= 25 November 2009|accessdate=21 April 2010 | location=London | first=John | last=Walsh|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uKhVAkON |archivedate = 18 November 2010|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
===Early life in London (1889–1909)===
Charles Spencer Chaplin was born on 16 April 1889, supposedly in [[East Street Market|East Street]], [[Walworth]], London, England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lynn|first=Kenneth|title=Charlie Chaplin and His Times|accessdate=4 June 2010|edition=illustrated|year=1997|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-0-684-80851-2|page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; (In 2011, a letter, written to him in the 1970s, came to light, suggesting that he had been born in a gypsy caravan at [[Black Patch Park]] in [[Smethwick]], Staffordshire.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.expressandstar.com/news/2011/02/18/charlie-chaplin-was-born-into-midland-gipsy-family/ Express &amp; Star, 18 Feb 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;) His parents were entertainers in the [[music hall]] tradition; his father, Charles Spencer Chaplin Sr, was a vocalist and an actor while his mother, [[Hannah Chaplin]], was a singer and an actress who went by the stage name Lilly Harley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Robinson|first=David|title=Chaplin, the mirror of opinion|accessdate=21 June 2010|edition=illustrated|year=1983|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0-253-21160-6|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; They separated before Charlie was three. He learned singing from his parents. The 1891 [[census]] shows that his mother lived with Charlie and his older half-brother [[Sydney Chaplin|Sydney]] on Barlow Street, Walworth.

As a child, Chaplin also lived with his mother in various addresses in and around [[Kennington Road]] in [[Lambeth]], including 3 Pownall Terrace, Chester Street and 39 Methley Street. His paternal grandmother's mother was from the Smith family of [[Romanichal]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hancock, F.|first=Ian|authorlink=Ian Hancock|title=We are the Romani People|publisher=University of Hertfordshire Press|location=Hatfield|year=2002|pages=129–130|isbn=978-1-902806-19-8|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=MG0ahVw-kdwC&amp;lpg=PA129&amp;ots=PiTKUOos0d&amp;dq=Charlie%20Chaplin%20Romani&amp;pg=PA129#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; a fact of which he was extremely proud,&lt;ref&gt;Charles Chaplin, Jr., with N. and M. Rau, My Father, Charlie Chaplin, Random House: New York,(1960), pages 7–8.

A [[larynx]] condition ended the singing career of Hannah Chaplin.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goncalves&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Goncalves|first=Regina|title=Einstein, Picasso, Agatha and Chaplin|accessdate=21 June 2010|year=2008|publisher=Lulu.com|location=Raleigh, NC|isbn=978-1-4092-1566-0|page=226}}&lt;/ref&gt; After her re-admission to the Cane Hill Asylum, her son was left in the [[workhouse]] at Lambeth in south London, moving several weeks later to the [[Central London District School]] for paupers in [[Hanwell]].

In 1903 Chaplin secured the role of Billy the pageboy in ''Sherlock Holmes'', written by [[William Gillette]] and starring English actor [[Harry Arthur Saintsbury|H. A. Saintsbury]]. Saintsbury took Chaplin under his wing and taught him to marshal his talents. In 1905 Gillette came to England with [[Marie Doro]] to debut his new play, ''Clarice'', but the play did not go well. When Gillette staged his one-act curtain-raiser, ''The Painful Predicament of Sherlock Holmes'' as a joke on the British press, Chaplin was brought in from the provinces to play Billy. When ''Sherlock Holmes'' was substituted for ''Clarice'', Chaplin remained as Billy until the production ended on 2 December. During the run, Gillette coached Chaplin in his restrained acting style. It was during this engagement that the teenage Chaplin fell hopelessly in love with Doro, but his love went unrequited and Doro returned to America with Gillette when the production closed.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, David, ''Chaplin, His Life and Art'' (Da Capo Press, 1994), p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

They met again in Hollywood eleven years later. She had forgotten his name but, when introduced to her, Chaplin told her of being silently in love with her and how she had broken his young heart. Over dinner, he laid it on thick about his unrequited love. Nothing came of it until two years later, when they were both in New York and she invited him to dinner and a drive. Instead, Chaplin noted, they simply “dined quietly in Marie’s apartment alone.” However, as Kenneth Lynn pointed out, “Chaplin would not have been Chaplin if he had simply dined quietly with Marie.”&lt;ref&gt;Lynn, Kenneth Schuyler, ''Charlie Chaplin and His Times'' (Simon &amp; Schuster, 1997), pp. 210-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

===First years in the United States (1910–1913)===
[[File:Charlie Chaplin I.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Chaplin circa 1910]]
Chaplin first toured the United States with the [[Fred Karno]] troupe from 1910 to 1912. After five months in England, he returned to the U.S. for a second tour, arriving with the Karno Troupe on 2 October 1912. In the Karno Company was Arthur Stanley Jefferson, who later became known as [[Stan Laurel]]. Chaplin and Laurel shared a room in a boarding house. Laurel returned to England but Chaplin remained in the United States. In late 1913, Chaplin's act with the Karno Troupe was seen by [[Mack Sennett]], [[Mabel Normand]], [[Minta Durfee]], and [[Roscoe Arbuckle|&quot;Fatty&quot; Arbuckle]]. Sennett hired him for his studio, the [[Keystone Studios|Keystone Film Company]] as a replacement for [[Ford Sterling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=My Autobiography |last=Chaplin |first=Charles |year=1964 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=978-0-14-101147-9 |pages=137–139 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chaplin had considerable difficulty adjusting to the demands of film acting and his performance suffered for it. After Chaplin's first film appearance, ''[[Making a Living]]'' was filmed, Sennett felt he had made a costly mistake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=My Autobiography |last=Chaplin |first=Charles |year=1964 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=978-0-14-101147-9 |page=149 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most historians agree it was Normand who persuaded him to give Chaplin another chance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mabel: Hollywood's First I Don't Care Girl |last=Fussell |first=Betty|authorlink=Betty Fussell |year=1982 |publisher=Limelight Edition |isbn=978-0-87910-158-9 |pages=70–71 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sennett did not warm to Chaplin right away, and Chaplin believed Sennett intended to fire him following a disagreement with Normand.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chaplin149-150&quot; /&gt; However, Chaplin's pictures were soon a success, and he became one of the biggest stars at Keystone.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chaplin149-150&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Tramp&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/pickford/peopleevents/p_chaplin.html |title=American Experience &amp;#124; Mary Pickford &amp;#124; People &amp; Events |publisher=PBS |date=25 December 1977 |accessdate=21 April 2010|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uKhZChEI |archivedate = 18 November 2010|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chaplin was given over to Normand, who directed and wrote a handful of his earliest films.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chaplin149-150&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=My Autobiography |last=Chaplin |first=Charles |year=1964 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=978-0-14-101147-9 |pages=149–150 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chaplin did not enjoy being directed by a woman, and they often disagreed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chaplin149-150&quot; /&gt; Eventually, the two worked out their differences and remained friends long after Chaplin left Keystone.

===The Tramp (1914–1915)===
[[File:ChaplinMakinALiving.jpg|thumb|Chaplin (Right) in his film debut ''[[Making a Living]]'' (1914)]]
The Tramp debuted during the silent film era in the Keystone comedy ''[[Kid Auto Races at Venice]]'' (released on 7 February 1914). However, Chaplin had devised the tramp costume for a film produced a few days earlier but released later (9 February 1914), ''[[Mabel's Strange Predicament]]''. Mack Sennett had requested that Chaplin &quot;get into a comedy make-up&quot;.&lt;ref name=Sutton&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sutton |first1=Caroline |title=How Did They Do That? Wonders of the Far and Recent Past Explained |year=1985 |publisher=Hilltown, Quill |location=New York|isbn=978-0-688-05935-4 |page=174}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Chaplin recalled in his [[My Autobiography (Chaplin)|autobiography]]:
{{quote|I had no idea what makeup to put on. I did not like my get-up as the press reporter [in ''Making a Living'']. However on the way to the wardrobe I thought I would dress in baggy pants, big shoes, a cane and a derby hat. I wanted everything to be a contradiction: the pants baggy, the coat tight, the hat small and the shoes large. I was undecided whether to look old or young, but remembering Sennett had expected me to be a much older man, I added a small moustache, which I reasoned, would add age without hiding my expression. I had no idea of the character. But the moment I was dressed, the clothes and the makeup made me feel the person he was. I began to know him, and by the time I walked on stage he was fully born.&lt;ref name=&quot;ChaplinTrampMakeup&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=My Autobiography |last=Chaplin |first=Charles |year=1964 |page=154}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

&quot;The Tramp&quot; is a [[vagrancy (people)|vagrant]] with the refined manners, clothes, and dignity of a [[gentleman]]. Arbuckle contributed his father-in-law's [[bowler hat|derby]] and his own pants (of generous proportions). [[Chester Conklin]] provided the little [[tailcoat|cutaway]] tailcoat, and [[Ford Sterling]] the size-14 shoes, which were so big, Chaplin had to wear each on the wrong foot to keep them on. He devised the moustache from a bit of crepe hair belonging to [[Mack Swain]]. The only thing Chaplin himself owned was the [[whangee]] cane.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sutton&quot; /&gt;

[[File:Chaplin - Kid Auto Races in Venice.png|thumb|left|''[[Kid Auto Races at Venice]]'' (1914): Chaplin's second film and the debut of his &quot;tramp&quot; costume]]
Chaplin, with his Little Tramp character, quickly became the most popular star in Sennett's company of players. He immediately gained enormous popularity among cinema audiences. &quot;[[The Tramp]]&quot;, Chaplin's principal character, was known as &quot;Charlot&quot; in the [[Francophonie|French-speaking world]], Italy, Spain, [[Andorra]], Portugal, Greece, [[Romania]] and [[Turkey]], &quot;Carlitos&quot; in [[Brazil]] and [[Argentina]], and &quot;Der Vagabund&quot; in Germany.

Chaplin continued to play the Tramp through dozens of short films and, later, feature-length productions (in only a handful of other productions did he play characters other than the Tramp). He portrayed a [[Keystone Kop]] in ''[[A Thief Catcher]]'' filmed 5–26 Jan, 1914.&lt;ref name=&quot;ChaplinWP&quot;&gt;{{cite article |title=The 'Thief' in festival's lineup is famous face, indeed: Chaplin's |last=Trescott |first=Jaqueline |date=13 June 2010 |publisher=Washington Post |page=E7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tramp was closely identified with the silent era, and was considered an international character; when the sound era began in the late 1920s, Chaplin refused to make a talkie featuring the character. The 1931 production ''[[City Lights]]'' featured no dialogue. Chaplin officially retired the character in the film ''[[Modern Times (film)|Modern Times]]'' (released 5 February 1936), which appropriately ended with the Tramp walking down an endless highway toward the horizon. The film was only a partial talkie and is often called the last silent film. The Tramp remains silent until near the end of the film when, for the first time, his voice is finally heard, albeit only as part of a French/Italian-derived gibberish song.

[[File:Chaplin-charlie.jpg|thumb|upright|Chaplin in character in the 1910s]]
Chaplin's early Keystones use the standard Mack Sennett formula of extreme [[physical comedy]] and exaggerated gestures. Chaplin's pantomime was subtler, more suitable to romantic and domestic farces than to the usual Keystone chases and mob scenes. The visual gags were pure Keystone, however; the tramp character would aggressively assault his enemies with kicks and bricks. Moviegoers loved this cheerfully earthy new comedian, even though critics warned that his antics bordered on vulgarity. Chaplin was soon entrusted with directing and editing his own films. He made 34 shorts for Sennett during his first year in pictures, as well as the landmark comedy feature ''[[Tillie's Punctured Romance (1914 film)|Tillie's Punctured Romance]]''.

The Tramp was featured in the first film trailer to be exhibited in a U.S. cinema, a slide promotion developed by [[Nils Granlund]], advertising manager for the [[Marcus Loew]] theatre chain, and shown at the Loew's Seventh Avenue Theatre in Harlem in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nils Granlund|Granlund, Nils]] (1957). ''Blondes, Brunettes and Bullets''. New York: Van Rees Press, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1915, Chaplin signed a much more favourable contract with [[Essanay Studios]], and further developed his cinematic skills, adding new levels of depth and pathos to the Keystone-style slapstick. Most of the Essanay films were more ambitious, running twice as long as the average Keystone comedy. Chaplin also developed his own stock company, including [[Ingenue (stock character)|ingénue]] [[Edna Purviance]] and comic villains [[Leo White]] and Bud Jamison.

Chaplin was emerging as the supreme exponent of silent films, an emigrant himself from London. Chaplin's Tramp enacted the difficulties and humiliations of the immigrant [[underdog (competition)|underdog]], the constant struggle at the bottom of the American heap and yet he triumphed over adversity without ever rising to the top, and thereby stayed in touch with his audience. Chaplin's films were also deliciously subversive. The bumbling officials enabled the immigrants to laugh at those they feared.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Hughes (critic)|Robert Hughes]] ''American Visions'' BBCTV&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pioneering film artist and global celebrity (1916–1918)===
[[File:Charlie Chaplin, bond of friendship, 1918.ogg|thumb|left|A clip from the Charlie Chaplin silent film, ''The Bond'' (1918).]]
In 1916, the [[Mutual Film Corporation]] paid Chaplin US$670,000 to produce a dozen two-reel comedies. He was given near complete artistic control, and produced twelve films over an eighteen-month period that rank among the most influential comedy films in all cinema. Of his Mutual comedies, the best known include: ''[[Easy Street (film)|Easy Street]]'', ''[[One A.M.]]'', ''[[The Pawnshop]]'', and ''[[The Adventurer (film)|The Adventurer]]''. Edna Purviance remained the leading lady, and Chaplin added [[Eric Campbell (actor)|Eric Campbell]], [[Henry Bergman]], and [[Albert Austin]] to his stock company; Campbell, a [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] veteran, provided superb villainy, and second bananas Bergman and Austin would remain with Chaplin for decades. Chaplin regarded the Mutual period as the happiest of his career, although he also had concerns that the films during that time were becoming formulaic owing to the stringent production schedule his contract required. Upon the U.S. entering World War I, Chaplin became a spokesman for Liberty Bonds with his close friend Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tramp&quot; /&gt;

Most of the Chaplin films in circulation date from his Keystone, Essanay, and Mutual periods. After Chaplin assumed control of his productions in 1918 (and kept exhibitors and audiences waiting for them), entrepreneurs serviced the demand for Chaplin by bringing back his older comedies. The films were recut, retitled, and reissued again and again, first for theatres, then for the home-film market, and in recent years, for home video. Even Essanay was guilty of this practice, fashioning &quot;new&quot; Chaplin comedies from old film clips and out-takes. The twelve Mutual comedies were revamped as sound films in 1933, when producer Amadee J. Van Beuren added new [[film score|orchestral scores]] and [[sound effects]].

At the conclusion of the Mutual contract in 1917, Chaplin signed a contract with [[First National]] to produce eight two-reel films. First National financed and distributed these pictures (1918–23) but otherwise gave him complete creative control over production. Chaplin now had his own studio, and he could work at a more relaxed pace that allowed him to focus on quality. Although First National expected Chaplin to deliver short comedies like the celebrated Mutuals, Chaplin ambitiously expanded most of his personal projects into longer, feature-length films, including ''[[Shoulder Arms]]'' (1918), ''[[The Pilgrim (film)|The Pilgrim]]'' (1923) and the feature-length classic ''[[The Kid (1921 film)|The Kid]]'' (1921).

===United Artists (1919–1939)===
[[File:CharlieChaplinStudios-1922.jpg|thumb|[[Charlie Chaplin Studios]], 1922]]

In 1919, Chaplin co-founded the [[United Artists]] film distribution company with [[Mary Pickford]], [[Douglas Fairbanks]] and [[D. W. Griffith]], all of whom were seeking to escape the growing power consolidation of film distributors and financiers in the developing Hollywood [[studio system]]. This move, along with complete control of his film production through his studio, assured Chaplin's independence as a film-maker. He served on the board of UA until the early 1950s.

All Chaplin's United Artists pictures were of feature length, beginning with the atypical drama in which Chaplin had only a brief cameo role, ''[[A Woman of Paris]]'' (1923). This was followed by the classic comedies ''[[The Gold Rush]]'' (1925) and ''[[The Circus (film)|The Circus]]'' (1928).

After the arrival of sound films, Chaplin continued to focus on silent films; ''The Circus'' (1928), ''[[City Lights]]'' (1931), and ''[[Modern Times (film)|Modern Times]]'' (1936) were essentially silent films scored with his own music and sound effects. ''City Lights'' has been praised for its mixture of comedy and sentimentality. Critic [[James Agee]], for example, wrote in ''Life'' magazine in 1949 that the final scene in ''City Lights'' was the &quot;greatest single piece of acting ever committed to [[celluloid]]&quot;.

[[File:Chaplin The Kid.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Chaplin and [[Jackie Coogan]] in ''The Kid'' (1921)]]
While ''Modern Times'' (1936) is a non-talkie, it does contain talk—usually coming from inanimate objects such as a radio or a TV monitor. This was done to help 1930s audiences, who were out of the habit of watching silent films, adjust to not hearing dialogue. ''Modern Times'' was the first film where Chaplin's voice is heard (in the [[Modern Times (film)#Nonsense song|nonsense song]] at the end, which Chaplin both performed and wrote the nonsense lyrics to). However, for most viewers it is still considered a silent film.

Although &quot;[[talkie]]s&quot; became the dominant mode of film making soon after they were introduced in 1927, Chaplin resisted making such a film all through the 1930s. He considered cinema essentially a pantomimic art. He said: &quot;Action is more generally understood than words. Like Chinese symbolism, it will mean different things according to its scenic connotation. Listen to a description of some unfamiliar object—an African warthog, for example; then look at a picture of the animal and see how surprised you are&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Monday, 9 Feb. 1931 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,741027-1,00.html |title=Time Magazine, 9&amp;nbsp;February 1931 |publisher=Time.com |date=9 February 1931 |accessdate=21 April 2010|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uKhaAy20 |archivedate = 18 November 2010|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a tribute to Chaplin's versatility that he also has one film credit for [[choreography]] for the 1952 film ''[[Limelight (1952 film)|Limelight]]'', and another as a singer for the title music of ''The Circus'' (1928). The best known of several songs he composed are &quot;[[Smile (Charlie Chaplin song)|Smile]]&quot;, composed for the film ''[[Modern Times (film)|Modern Times]]'' (1936) and given lyrics to help promote a 1950s revival of the film, famously covered by [[Nat King Cole]]. &quot;[[This Is My Song (1967 song)|This Is My Song]]&quot; from Chaplin's last film, ''[[A Countess from Hong Kong]]'', was a number one hit in several different languages in the late 1960s (most notably the version by [[Petula Clark]] and discovery of an unreleased version in the 1990s recorded in 1967 by [[Judith Durham]] of [[The Seekers]]), and Chaplin's theme from ''[[Limelight (1952 film)|Limelight]]'' was a hit in the 1950s under the title &quot;[[Eternally (1953 song)|Eternally]].&quot; Chaplin's score to ''[[Limelight (1952 film)|Limelight]]'' won an [[Academy Award]] in 1972; a delay in the film premiering in Los Angeles made it eligible decades after it was filmed. Chaplin also wrote scores for his earlier silent films when they were re-released in the sound era, notably ''The Kid'' for its 1971 re-release.

===''The Great Dictator'' (1940)===
[[File:Dictator charlie4.jpg|thumb|right|Charlie Chaplin in the film ''The Great Dictator'']]
Chaplin's first talking picture, ''[[The Great Dictator]]'' (1940), was an act of defiance against [[Nazism]]. It was filmed and released in the United States one year before the U.S. entry into World War II. Chaplin played the role of &quot;Adenoid Hynkel&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;{{IMDb title|id=0032553|title=The Great Dictator}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dictator of Tomainia, modelled on German dictator [[Adolf Hitler]], who was only four days his junior and sported a similar moustache. The film also showcased comedian [[Jack Oakie]] as &quot;Benzino Napaloni&quot;, dictator of Bacteria, a jab at Italian dictator [[Benito Mussolini]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

[[Paulette Goddard]] filmed with Chaplin again, depicting a woman in the ghetto. The film was seen as an act of courage in the political environment of the time, both for its ridicule of Nazism, for the portrayal of overt [[Jewish]] characters, and the depiction of their persecution. In addition to Hynkel, Chaplin also played a look-alike Jewish barber persecuted by the regime. The barber physically resembled the Tramp character.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

At the conclusion, the two characters Chaplin portrayed swapped positions through a complex plot, and he dropped out of his comic character to address the audience directly in a speech&lt;ref name=&quot;The speech of the Great Dictator&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vagabundia.net/dictator.html |title=The speech of the Great Dictator |publisher=Vagabundia.net |date= |accessdate=29 August 2010|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uKhawMg7 |archivedate = 18 November 2010|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; denouncing dictatorship, greed, hate, and intolerance, in favor of liberty and human brotherhood.

The film was nominated for Academy awards for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture (producer)]], [[Academy Award for Best Writing (Original Screenplay)|Best Original Screenplay (writer)]] and [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://movies.yahoo.com/movie/1800072595/awards |title=The Great Dictator (1940) |publisher=Movies.yahoo.com |date= |accessdate=29 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===McCarthy era===
Although Chaplin had his major successes in the United States and was a resident from 1914 to 1953, he always maintained a neutral nationalistic stance. During the era of [[McCarthyism]], Chaplin was accused of &quot;[[un-American activities]]&quot; as a suspected [[communism|communist]] and [[J. Edgar Hoover]], who had instructed the [[FBI]] to keep extensive secret files on him, tried to end his United States residency. FBI pressure on Chaplin grew after his 1942 campaign for a second European front in the war and reached a critical level in the late 1940s, when Congressional figures threatened to call him as a witness in hearings. This was never done, probably from fear of Chaplin's ability to lampoon the investigators.&lt;ref name = &quot;fjnruu&quot;&gt;Whitfield, Stephen J., ''The Culture of the Cold War'', page 187-192&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1952, Chaplin left the US for what was intended as a brief trip home to the United Kingdom for the London premiere of ''[[Limelight (1952 film)|Limelight]]''. Hoover learned of the trip and negotiated with the [[Immigration and Naturalization Service]] to revoke Chaplin's re-entry permit, exiling Chaplin so he could not return for his alleged political leanings. Chaplin decided not to re-enter the United States, writing: &quot;Since the end of the last world war, I have been the object of lies and [[propaganda]] by powerful reactionary groups who, by their influence and by the aid of America's [[yellow journalism|yellow press]], have created an unhealthy atmosphere in which liberal-minded individuals can be singled out and persecuted. Under these conditions I find it virtually impossible to continue my motion-picture work, and I have therefore given up my residence in the United States.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Names make news. Last week these names made this news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,818302-2,00.html |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=27 April 1953|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uKhcJuQq |archivedate = 18 November 2010|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That Chaplin was unprepared to remain abroad, or that the revocation of his right to re-enter the United States by FBI Director [[J. Edgar Hoover]] was a surprise to him, may be apocryphal: An anecdote in some contradiction is recorded during a broad interview with [[Richard Avedon]], celebrated New York portraitist.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Avedon]]: Darkness and Light (1996)
[[American Masters]], [[PBS]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Avedon is credited with the last portrait of the entertainer to be taken before his departure to Europe and therefore, the last photograph of him as a singularly “American icon.” According to Avedon, Chaplin telephoned him at his studio in New York City, while on a layover for transportation connections before the final leg of his travel to England. The photographer considered the impromptu self-introduction a prank and angrily answered his caller with the riposte, “If you’re Charlie Chaplin, I’m Franklin Roosevelt!” To mollify Avedon, Chaplin assured the photographer of his authenticity and added the comment, “If you want to take my picture, you better do it now. They are coming after me and I won’t be back. I leave ... (imminently).” Avedon interrupted his production commitments to take Chaplin’s portrait the next day, and never personally saw Chaplin again.

Chaplin then made his home in [[Vevey]], Switzerland. He briefly and triumphantly returned to the United States in April 1972, with his wife, to receive an [[Academy Honorary Award|Honorary Oscar]], and also to discuss how his films would be re-released and marketed.

===Final works (1957–1976)===

[[File:RoyLindmanCharlieChaplin.jpg|thumb|right|Charlie Chaplin Statue in Vevey, Switzerland]]

Chaplin's final two films were made in London: ''[[A King in New York]]'' (1957) in which he starred, wrote, directed and produced; and ''[[A Countess from Hong Kong]]'' (1967), which he directed, produced, and wrote. The latter film stars [[Sophia Loren]] and [[Marlon Brando]], and Chaplin made his final on-screen appearance in a brief cameo role as a seasick steward. He also composed the music for both films with the theme song from ''A Countess From Hong Kong,'' &quot;[[This Is My Song (1967 song)|This is My Song]]&quot;, reaching number one in the UK as sung by [[Petula Clark]]. Chaplin also compiled a film ''[[The Chaplin Revue]]'' from three First National films ''[[A Dog's Life]]'' (1918), ''[[Shoulder Arms]]'' (1918) and ''[[The Pilgrim (film)|The Pilgrim]]'' (1923) for which he composed the music and recorded an introductory narration. As well as directing these final films, Chaplin also wrote ''My Autobiography,'' between 1959 and 1963, which was published in 1964.

In his pictorial autobiography ''My Life In Pictures'', published in 1974, Chaplin indicated that he had written a screenplay for his daughter, Victoria; entitled ''[[The Freak]]'', the film would have cast her as an angel. According to Chaplin, a script was completed and pre-production rehearsals had begun on the film (the book includes a photograph of Victoria in costume), but were halted when Victoria married. &quot;I mean to make it some day,&quot; Chaplin wrote. However, his health declined steadily in the 1970s which hampered all hopes of the film ever being produced.

From 1969 until 1976, Chaplin wrote original music compositions and scores for his silent pictures and re-released them. He composed the scores of all his First National shorts: ''[[The Idle Class]]'' in 1971 (paired with The Kid for re-release in 1972), ''[[A Day's Pleasure]]'' in 1973, ''[[Pay Day (1922 film)|Pay Day]]'' in 1972, ''[[Sunnyside (film)|Sunnyside]]'' in 1974, and of his feature length films firstly ''[[The Circus (film)|The Circus]]'' in 1969 and ''[[The Kid (1921 film)|The Kid]]'' in 1971. Chaplin worked with music associate Eric James whilst composing all his scores.

Chaplin's last completed work was the score for his 1923 film ''[[A Woman of Paris]]'', which was completed in 1976, by which time Chaplin was extremely frail, even finding communication difficult.

===Death (1977)===
[[File:Charles Chaplin Grave in Corsier-sur-Vevey.jpg|thumb|upright|Chaplin's grave in Switzerland]]
Chaplin's robust health began to slowly fail in the late 1960s, after the completion of his final film ''[[A Countess from Hong Kong]]'', and more rapidly after he received his Academy Award in 1972. By 1977, he had difficulty communicating, and was using a wheelchair. Chaplin died in his sleep in [[Vevey]], Switzerland on Christmas Day 1977.&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Charlie Chaplin Dead at 88; Made the Film an Art Form. |url=http://www.nytimes.com/books/97/03/30/reviews/chaplin-obit.html |quote=Charlie Chaplin, the poignant little tramp with the cane and comic walk who almost single-handedly elevated the novelty entertainment medium of motion pictures into art, died peacefully yesterday at his home in Switzerland.

His body was reburied under {{convert|6|ft|m}} of concrete to prevent further attempts.

==Filmmaking techniques==
Chaplin never spoke more than cursorily about his filmmaking methods, claiming such a thing would be tantamount to a magician spoiling his own illusion. In fact, until he began making spoken dialogue films with ''[[The Great Dictator]]'' in 1940, Chaplin never shot from a completed script. The method he developed, once his Essanay contract gave him the freedom to write for and direct himself, was to start from a vague premise—for example &quot;Charlie enters a health spa&quot; or &quot;Charlie works in a pawn shop.&quot; Chaplin then had sets constructed and worked with his stock company to improvise gags and &quot;business&quot; around them, almost always working the ideas out on film. As ideas were accepted and discarded, a narrative structure would emerge, frequently requiring Chaplin to reshoot an already-completed scene that might have otherwise contradicted the story.&lt;ref name = &quot;Unknown Chaplin&quot;&gt;{{IMDb title|0158310|Unknown Chaplin}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chaplin's unique filmmaking techniques became known only after his death, when his rare surviving outtakes and cut sequences were carefully examined in the 1983 British documentary ''[[Unknown Chaplin]]''.

This is one reason why Chaplin took so much longer to complete his films than his rivals did. In addition, Chaplin was an incredibly exacting director, showing his actors exactly how he wanted them to perform and shooting scores of takes until he had the shot he wanted. Animator [[Chuck Jones]], who lived near Charlie Chaplin's Lone Star studio as a boy, remembered his father saying he watched Chaplin shoot a scene more than a hundred times until he was satisfied with it.&lt;ref&gt;[[Chuck Jones|Jones, Chuck]]. ''Chuck Amuck: The Life and Times of an Animated Cartoonist''. Avon Books, ISBN 978-0-380-71214-4)&lt;/ref&gt; This combination of story improvisation and relentless perfectionism—which resulted in days of effort and thousands of feet of film being wasted, all at enormous expense—often proved very taxing for Chaplin, who in frustration would often lash out at his actors and crew, keep them waiting idly for hours or, in extreme cases, shutting down production altogether.&lt;ref name = &quot;Unknown Chaplin&quot;/&gt;

==Comparison with other silent comics==
Since the 1960s, Chaplin's films have been compared to those of [[Buster Keaton]] and [[Harold Lloyd]] (the other two great silent film comedians of the time), especially among the loyal fans of each comic.

The three had different styles: Chaplin had a strong affinity for sentimentality and pathos (which was popular in the 1920s), Lloyd was renowned for his everyman persona and 1920s optimism, and Keaton adhered to onscreen stoicism with a cynical tone more suited to modern audiences.

Commercially, Chaplin made some of the [[Silent film#Top grossing silent films|highest-grossing films in the silent era]]; ''[[The Gold Rush]]'' is the fifth with US$4.25&amp;nbsp;million and ''[[The Circus (film)|The Circus]]'' is the seventh with US$3.8&amp;nbsp;million. However, Chaplin's films combined made about US$10.5&amp;nbsp;million while Harold Lloyd's grossed US$15.7&amp;nbsp;million. Lloyd was far more prolific, releasing twelve feature films in the 1920s while Chaplin released just three. Buster Keaton's films were not nearly as commercially successful as Chaplin's or Lloyd's even at the height of his popularity, and only received belated critical acclaim in the late 1950s and 1960s.

There is evidence that Chaplin and Keaton, who both got their start in vaudeville, thought highly of one another: Keaton stated in his autobiography that Chaplin was the greatest comedian that ever lived, and the greatest comedy director, whereas Chaplin welcomed Keaton to [[United Artists]] in 1925, advised him against his disastrous move to MGM in 1928, and for his last American film, ''[[Limelight (1952 film)|Limelight]]'', wrote a part specifically for Keaton as his first on-screen comedy partner since 1915.

==Composer and songwriter==
Chaplin wrote or co-wrote the scores and songs for many of his films. &quot;[[Smile (Charlie Chaplin song)|Smile]]&quot;, which he composed for his film, ''[[Modern Times (film)|Modern Times]]'', hit number 2 on the UK charts when sung by [[Nat King Cole]] in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.everyhit.com/searchsec.php everyHit.com search results]&lt;/ref&gt; It was also [[Michael Jackson]]'s favourite song.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tmz.com/2009/07/07/brooke-shields-just-smile/ |title=Brooke Shields – Just Smile |publisher=TMZ.com |date=7 July 2009 |accessdate=21 April 2010|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uKhfnnuD |archivedate = 18 November 2010|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;[[This Is My Song (1967 song)|This Is My Song]]&quot;, written and composed by Chaplin for his film, ''[[A Countess from Hong Kong]]'', hit number 1 on the UK charts when sung by [[Petula Clark]] in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.petulaclark.net/chartsbritish.html |title=British Record Charts |publisher=Petula Clark.net |date= |accessdate=21 April 2010|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uKhggvxw |archivedate = 18 November 2010|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973, Chaplin won the [[Academy Award|Oscar]] for [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Film Score]] for his film, ''[[Limelight (1952 film)|Limelight]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0044837/awards Limelight (1952) – Awards]&lt;/ref&gt; Chaplin was not the only member of his family with musical talent; his nephew, [[Spencer Dryden]] was the drummer for the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] inducted band, [[Jefferson Airplane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/newridersofthepurplesage/articles/story/6840281/airplanes_dryden_dies |title=Rolling Stone Music &amp;#124; Top Artists, News, Reviews, Photos and Videos |publisher=Rollingstone.com |date= |accessdate=29 August 2010|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uKhhSIgP |archivedate = 18 November 2010|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
[[File:Chaplin.and.Eastman.jpg|thumb|left|Chaplin with American socialist [[Max Eastman]] in Hollywood 1919]]
Chaplin's [[political]] sympathies always lay with the [[left-wing politics|left]]. His silent films made prior to the [[Great Depression]] typically did not contain overt political themes or messages, apart from the Tramp's plight in [[poverty]] and his run-ins with the law, but his 1930s films were more openly political. ''[[Modern Times (film)|Modern Times]]'' depicts workers and poor people in dismal conditions. The final dramatic speech in ''The Great Dictator'', which was critical of following patriotic nationalism without question, and his vocal public support for the opening of a second European front in 1942 to assist the [[Soviet Union]] in World War II were controversial.

[[File:Chaplin and Gandhi.jpg|thumb|right|Chaplin with [[Mahatma Gandhi]] in Canning Town, London, 1931.]]
Chaplin declined to support the war effort as he had done for World War I which led to public anger, although his two sons saw service in the Army in Europe. For most of World War II he was fighting serious criminal and civil charges related to his involvement with actress [[Joan Barry (American actress)|Joan Barry]] (see below). After the war, his 1947 [[black comedy]], ''[[Monsieur Verdoux]]'' showed a critical view of [[capitalism]]. Chaplin's final American film, ''[[Limelight (1952 film)|Limelight]]'', was less political and more autobiographical in nature. His following European-made film, ''[[A King in New York]]'' (1957), satirised the political persecution and paranoia that had forced him to leave the U.S. five years earlier.

On religion, Chaplin wrote in his autobiography, “In Philadelphia, I inadvertently came upon an edition of Robert Ingersoll's Essays and Lectures. This was an exciting discovery; his atheism confirmed my own belief that the horrific cruelty of the Old Testament was degrading to the human spirit.”

==Other controversies==
During World War I, Chaplin was criticised in the British press for not joining the Army. He had in fact presented himself for service, but was denied for being too small at 5'5&quot; and underweight. Chaplin raised substantial funds for the war effort during [[war bond]] drives not only with public speaking at rallies but also by making, at his own expense, ''[[The Bond]]'', a comedic [[propaganda film]] used in 1918. The lingering controversy may have prevented Chaplin from receiving a knighthood in the 1930s. A 1916 propaganda short film ''Zepped'' with Chaplin was discovered in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2009/nov/05/charlie-chaplin-ebay-reel-tin|title=Collector finds unseen Charlie Chaplin film in tin sold for £3.20 on eBay| work=The Guardian | location=London | first=Charlotte | last=Higgins | date=5 November 2009 | accessdate=28 April 2010|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uKhi5Htg |archivedate = 18 November 2010|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For Chaplin's entire career, some level of controversy existed over claims of Jewish ancestry. Nazi propaganda in the 1930s and 40s prominently portrayed him as Jewish (named Karl Tonstein) relying on articles published in the U.S. press before,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and FBI investigations of Chaplin in the late 1940s also focused on Chaplin's [[ethnic origin]]s. There is no documentary evidence of Jewish ancestry for Chaplin himself. For his entire public life, he fiercely refused to challenge or refute claims that he was Jewish, saying that to do so would always &quot;play directly into the hands of [[anti-Semites]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Harness2008&quot;&gt;{{cite book

Chaplin's lifelong [[ephebophilia|attraction to younger women]] remains another enduring source of interest to some. His biographers have attributed this to a teenage infatuation with Hetty Kelly, whom he met in Britain while performing in the music hall, and which possibly defined his feminine ideal. Chaplin clearly relished the role of discovering and closely guiding young female stars; with the exception of [[Mildred Harris]], all of his marriages and most of his major relationships began in this manner.

==Personal life and family==
{{Prose|section|date=February 2010}}
{{See also|Chaplin family}}
Chaplin's mother died in 1928 in [[Glendale, California]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chaplin|first1=Lita Grey |last2=Vance|first2=Jeffrey|title=Wife of the life of the party|edition=illustrated|series=The Scarecrow Filmmakers Series|volume=61|year=1998|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-3432-3|page=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; seven years after having been brought to the U.S. by her sons. Unknown to Charlie and Sydney until years later, they had a half-brother through their mother. The boy, [[Wheeler Dryden]] (1892–1957), was raised abroad by his father but later connected with the rest of the family and went to work for Chaplin at his [[Hollywood]] studio.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mehran&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chaplin.bfi.org.uk/programme/essays/collaborators.html|title=Chaplin's writing and directing collaborators|last=Mehran|first=Hooman|publisher=British Film Institute|accessdate=6 June 2010|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uKhk0d9q |archivedate = 18 November 2010|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The South African duo [[Locnville]], Andrew and Brian Chaplin, are related to Chaplin (their grandfather was Chaplin's first cousin).

===Relationships===
* '''Hetty Kelly''' was Chaplin's first love, a dancer with whom he fell in love when she was fifteen and almost married when he was nineteen, in 1908.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kohn|first=Ingeborg|title=Charlie Chaplin, Brightest star of silent films|edition=First|year=2005|publisher=Portaparole|location=Rome, Italy|isbn=978-88-89421-14-7|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is said Chaplin fell madly in love with her and asked her to marry him. When she refused, Chaplin suggested it would be best if they did not see each other again; he was reportedly crushed when she agreed. Years later, her memory would remain an obsession with Chaplin. He was devastated in 1921 when he learned that she had died of [[influenza]] during the [[1918 flu pandemic]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Cinema Genius&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Vance|first=Jeffrey|title=Chaplin: genius of the cinema|edition=illustrated|date=2 October 2003|publisher=Harry N. Abrams|location= New York|isbn=978-0-8109-4532-6|page=122}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[File:Immigrant1917.jpg|thumb|Chaplin with [[Edna Purviance]] in ''[[The Immigrant]]'' (1917).]] [[Edna Purviance]] was Chaplin's first major leading lady after Mabel Normand. Purviance and Chaplin were involved in a close romantic relationship during the production of his Essanay and Mutual films in 1916–1917. The romance seems to have ended by 1918, and Chaplin's marriage to [[Mildred Harris]] in late 1918 ended any possibility of reconciliation. Purviance would continue as leading lady in Chaplin's films until 1923, and would remain on Chaplin's payroll until her death in 1958. She and Chaplin spoke warmly of one another for the rest of their lives.
* [[File:MildredPrivatecolletion2.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[Mildred Harris]], c. 1918–1920]] [[Mildred Harris]]: On 23 October 1918, Chaplin, age 29, married the popular child actress, Harris, who was 16 at the time. They had one son, Norman Spencer &quot;The Little Mouse&quot; Chaplin, born on 7 July 1919, who died three days later and is interred under the name ''The Little Mouse'' at Inglewood Park Cemetery, Inglewood California. Chaplin separated from Harris by late 1919, moving back into the [[Los Angeles Athletic Club]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Maland1991&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Chaplin and American Culture |last=Maland |first=Charles J. |year=1991 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=978-0-691-02860-6 |pages=43–44 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=hJhaiT7B04AC }}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple divorced in November 1920, with Harris getting some of their community property and a US$100,000 settlement.&lt;ref name=&quot;Maland1991&quot;/&gt; Chaplin admitted that he &quot;was not in love, now that [he] was married [he] wanted to be and wanted the marriage to be a success.&quot; During the divorce, Chaplin claimed Harris had an affair with noted actress of the time [[Alla Nazimova]], rumoured to be fond of seducing young actresses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Lesbian Histories and Cultures |last=Zimmerman |first=Bonnie |year=1999 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-8153-1920-7 |page=374 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=0EUoCrFolGcC}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Pola Negri]]: Chaplin was involved in a very public relationship and engagement with the Polish actress, Negri, in 1922–23, after she arrived in Hollywood to star in films. The stormy on-off engagement was halted after about nine months, but in many ways it foreshadowed the modern stereotypes of Hollywood star relationships. Chaplin's public involvement with Negri was unique in his public life. By comparison he strove to keep his other romances during this period very discreet and private (usually without success). Many biographers have concluded the affair with Negri was largely for publicity purposes.
* [[Marion Davies]]: In 1924, during the time he was involved with the underage [[Lita Grey]], Chaplin was rumoured to have had a fling with actress Davies, companion of [[William Randolph Hearst]]. Davies and Chaplin were both present on Hearst's yacht the weekend preceding the mysterious death of [[Thomas Harper Ince]]. Charlie allegedly tried to persuade her to leave Hearst and remain with him, but she refused and stayed by Hearst's side until his death in 1951. Chaplin made a rare cameo appearance in Davies' 1928 film ''[[Show People]]'', and by some accounts supposedly continued an affair with her until 1931.
* [[Lita Grey]]: Chaplin first met Grey during the filming of ''The Kid''. Three years later, at age 35, he became involved with the then 16-year-old Grey during preparations for ''The Gold Rush'' in which she was to star as the female lead. They married on 26 November 1924, after she became pregnant (a development that resulted in her being removed from the cast of the film). They had two sons, the actors [[Charles Chaplin, Jr.]] (1925–1968) and [[Sydney Chaplin (actor)|Sydney Chaplin]] (1926–2009). The marriage was a disaster, with the couple hopelessly mismatched. The couple divorced on 22 August 1927.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2002/08/23/edold_ed3__57.php |title=International Herald Tribune. 23 August 2002. ''1927:Chaplin Divorce Settled: In our pages: 100, 75 and 50 years ago'' |publisher=International Herald Tribune |date=23 August 2002 |accessdate=21 April 2010}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their extraordinarily bitter divorce had Chaplin paying Grey a then-record-breaking US$825,000 settlement, on top of almost one million dollars in legal costs. The stress of the sensational divorce, compounded by a federal tax dispute, allegedly turned his hair white. The Chaplin biographer Joyce Milton asserted in ''Tramp: The Life of Charlie Chaplin'' that the Grey-Chaplin marriage was the inspiration for Vladimir Nabokov's 1950s novel ''[[Lolita]]''.
* [[Merna Kennedy]]: Lita Grey's friend, Kennedy was a dancer who Chaplin hired as the lead actress in ''[[The Circus (film)|The Circus]]'' (1928). It is rumoured that the two had an affair during shooting. Grey used the rumoured infidelity in her divorce proceedings.
* [[Georgia Hale]] was Lita Grey's replacement on ''The Gold Rush''. In the documentary series, ''[[Unknown Chaplin]]'', (directed and written by film historians [[Kevin Brownlow]] and [[David Gill (film historian)|David Gill]]), Hale, in a 1980s interview states that she had idolised Chaplin since childhood and that the then-19-year-old actress and Chaplin began an affair that continued for several years, which she details in her memoir, ''Charlie Chaplin: Intimate Close-Ups.'' During production of Chaplin's film ''[[City Lights]]'' in 1929–30, Hale, who by then was Chaplin's closest companion, was called in to replace [[Virginia Cherrill]] as the flower girl. Seven minutes of test footage survives from this recasting, and is included on the 2003 DVD release of the film, but economics forced Chaplin to rehire Cherrill. In discussing the situation in ''Unknown Chaplin'', Hale states that her relationship with Chaplin was as strong as ever during filming. Their romance apparently ended sometime after Chaplin's return from his world tour in 1933.
* [[Louise Brooks]] was a [[chorine]] in the ''[[Ziegfeld Follies]]'' when she met Chaplin. He had gone to New York for the opening there of ''The Gold Rush''. For two months in the summer of 1925, the two cavorted together at the Ritz, and with film financier A.C. Blumenthal and Brooks' fellow [[Ziegfeld girl]] [[Peggy Fears]] in Blumenthal's penthouse suite at the Ambassador Hotel. Brooks was with Chaplin when he spent four hours watching a musician torture a violin in a [[Lower East Side]] restaurant, an act he would recreate in ''[[Limelight (1952 film)|Limelight]]''.
* '''May Reeves''' was originally hired to be Chaplin's secretary on his 1931–1932 extended trip to Europe, dealing mostly with reading his personal correspondence. She worked only one morning, and then was introduced to Chaplin, who was instantly infatuated with her. May became his constant companion and lover on the trip, much to the disgust of Chaplin's brother, Syd. After Reeves also became involved with Syd, Chaplin ended the relationship and she left his entourage. Reeves chronicled her short time with Chaplin in her book, &quot;The Intimate Charlie Chaplin&quot;.
* [[File:Charlie Chaplin and Paulette Goddard in The Great Dictator trailer.JPG|thumb|right|Chaplin and [[Paulette Goddard]] in ''[[The Great Dictator]]'' (1940)]] [[Paulette Goddard]]: Chaplin and actress Goddard were involved in a romantic and professional relationship between 1932 and 1940, with Goddard living with Chaplin in his Beverly Hills home for most of this time. Chaplin gave her starring roles in ''Modern Times'' and ''The Great Dictator''. Refusal to clarify their marital status is often claimed to have eliminated Goddard from final consideration for the role of Scarlett O'Hara in ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]''. After the relationship ended in 1940, Chaplin and Goddard made public statements that they had been secretly married in 1936; but these claims were likely a mutual effort to prevent any lasting damage to Goddard's career. In any case, their relationship ended amicably in 1942, with Goddard being granted a settlement. Goddard went on to a major career in films at Paramount in the 1940s, working several times with [[Cecil B. DeMille]]. Like Chaplin, she lived her later life in Switzerland, dying in 1990.
* [[Joan Barry (American actress)|Joan Barry]] (1920–1996): In 1942, Chaplin had a brief affair with Barry, whom he was considering for a starring role in a proposed film, but the relationship ended when she began harassing him and displaying signs of severe mental illness (not unlike his mother). Chaplin's brief involvement with Barry proved to be a nightmare for him. After having a child, she filed a paternity suit against him in 1943. Although blood tests proved Chaplin was not the father of Barry's child, Barry's attorney, [[Joseph Scott (attorney)|Joseph Scott]], convinced the court that the tests were inadmissible as evidence, and Chaplin was ordered to support the child. The injustice of the ruling later led to a change in California law to allow blood tests as evidence. Federal prosecutors also brought [[Mann Act]] charges against Chaplin related to Barry in 1944, of which he was acquitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Mann &amp; Woman |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,850389,00.html |quote=Auburn-haired [[Joan Barry (American actress)|Joan Barry]], 24, who wandered from her native Detroit to New York to Hollywood in pursuit of a theatrical career, became a Chaplin protegee in the summer of 1941.

Throughout the summer and autumn, Miss Barry testified last week, she visited the ardent actor five or six times a week. By midwinter her visits were down to &quot;maybe three times a week&quot;.

* [[Oona O'Neill]]: During Chaplin's legal trouble over the Barry affair, he met O'Neill, daughter of [[Eugene O'Neill]], and married her on 16 June 1943. He was fifty-four; she had just turned eighteen. The marriage produced eight children; their last child, Christopher, was born when Chaplin was 73 years old.

Among other recognitions, Chaplin was given a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] in 1970; that he had not been among those originally honoured in 1961 caused some controversy.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Paul Williams, {{cite book |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=9W4R_CZtFe8C&amp;pg=PA311&amp;dq=charlie+chaplin+Hollywood+Walk+of+Fame&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;cd=6#v=onepage&amp;q=charlie%20chaplin%20Hollywood%20Walk%20of%20Fame&amp;f=false |title=''The Story of Hollywood: An Illustrated History'', page 311 |publisher=www.storyofhollywood.com, 2006, ISBN 978-0-9776299-0-9 |accessdate=15 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chaplin's Swiss mansion is to be opened as a museum tracing his life from the music halls in London to Hollywood fame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2009/nov/23/charlie-chaplin-museum-swiss-mansion |title=Charlie Chaplin museum to open in Swiss mansion|publisher=guardian.co.uk |accessdate=15 February 2010 | location=London | date=23 November 2009|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uKhtLViW |archivedate = 18 November 2010|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chaplinmuseum.com/ |title=Chaplin |publisher=www.chaplinmuseum.com |accessdate=15 February 2010 |archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uKhurpZx |archivedate = 18 November 2010|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A statue of Charlie Chaplin was made by [[John Doubleday]], to stand in [[Leicester Square]] in [[London]]. It was unveiled by Sir [[Ralph Richardson]] in 1981.{{sfn|Haining|1982|p=201}}
A bronze statue of him is at [[Waterville, County Kerry]].

===Academy Awards===
Chaplin received three [[Academy Award]]s in his lifetime: one for [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]], and two [[Academy Honorary Award|Honorary Awards]]. However, during his active years as a filmmaker, Chaplin expressed disdain for the Academy Awards; his son Charles Jr wrote that Chaplin invoked the ire of the Academy in the 1930s by jokingly using his 1929 Oscar as a doorstop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chaplin|first=Charles|title=My father, Charlie Chaplin|year=1960|publisher=Random House}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may help explain why ''[[City Lights]]'' and ''[[Modern Times (film)|Modern Times]],'' considered by several polls to be two of the greatest of all motion pictures,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chicagoreader.com/movies/100best.html |title=List-o-Mania: Or, How I Stopped Worrying and Learned to Love American Movies |author=[[Jonathan Rosenbaum|Rosenbaum, Jonathan]] |year=1998 |work=Chicago Reader|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uKhwkm9T |archivedate = 18 November 2010|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/2005/100movies/the_complete_list.html |title=The Complete List – ALL-TIME 100 Movies – TIME Magazine |year=2005 |work=Time.com|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uKhxpXpS |archivedate = 18 November 2010|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; were not nominated for a single Academy Award.

* '''The 1st Academy Awards ceremony''': When the first Oscars were awarded on 16 May 1929, the voting audit procedures that now exists had not yet been put into place, and the categories were still very fluid. Chaplin's ''[[The Circus (film)|The Circus]]'' was set to be heavily recognised, as Chaplin had originally been nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Production]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director in a Comedy Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] and [[Academy Award for Best Story|Best Writing (Original Story)]]. However, the Academy decided to withdraw his name from all the competitive categories and instead give him a Special Award &quot;for versatility and genius in acting, writing, directing and producing ''The Circus''&quot;. The only other film to receive a Special Award that year was ''[[The Jazz Singer (1927 film)|The Jazz Singer]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/about/history.html|title=History of the Academy Awards|publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|accessdate=7 June 2010|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uKhyVna9 |archivedate = 18 November 2010|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''The 13th Academy Awards ceremony''': In 1941, ''[[The Great Dictator]]'' was nominated for five awards, including two for Chaplin: Best Writing and Best Actor. Chaplin lost out on both counts. For writing, he lost to [[Preston Sturges]] for ''[[The Great McGinty]]'', and for acting to [[James Stewart]] for ''[[The Philadelphia Story (film)|The Philadelphia Story]]''.
* '''The 20th Academy Awards ceremony''': In 1948, Chaplin's screenplay for ''[[Monsieur Verdoux]]'' was nominated, but the award went instead to [[Sidney Sheldon]] for ''[[The Bachelor and the Bobby-Soxer]]''.
* '''The 44th Academy Awards ceremony''': Chaplin's second Oscar was awarded forty-three years after his first, in 1972. Chaplin came out of exile to accept the Honorary Award for &quot;the incalculable effect he has had in making motion pictures the art form of this century&quot;. Stepping onto the stage of the [[Dorothy Chandler Pavilion]], Chaplin received the longest [[standing ovation]] in Academy Award history, lasting a full twelve minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/charlie-chaplin-prepares-for-return-to-united-states-after-two-decades|title=Charlie Chaplin prepares for return to United States after two decades|publisher=A&amp;E Television Networks|accessdate=7 June 2010|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uKhzGYBk |archivedate = 18 November 2010|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''The 45th Academy Awards ceremony''': In 1973, Chaplin's film ''[[Limelight (1952 film)|Limelight]]'' was honoured with an Oscar for [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]]. Though the film had originally been released in 1952, due to Chaplin's political difficulties at the time, the film did not play for one week in Los Angeles, and thus did not meet the criterion for nomination until it was re-released in 1972.

Chaplin's &quot;tramp&quot; character is possibly the most imitated on all levels of entertainment. Chaplin once entered a &quot;Chaplin look-alike&quot; competition and came in third.&lt;ref name=&quot;HowellHowell2010&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Howell |first1=Melissa |last2=Howell |first2=Greg |last3=Pierce |first3=Seth |title=Fusion: Where You and God Connect |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=yQtygrZJ_O4C&amp;pg=PA275 |accessdate=23 March 2011 |date=1 August 2010 |publisher=Review and Herald Pub Assoc |isbn=9780828025478 |page=275}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/movies/actors/chaplin2.asp |title=You All Look Alike |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Snopes.com |accessdate=5 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The influence of his 'Tramp' character could be seen on other artists and media providers. Beginning early on there were many tributes, and parodies made. Early examples include; [[E. C. Segar]]'s 1916 comic strip &quot;Charlie Chaplin's Comedy Capers&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cope |first=Mike |title=The Last of the Funnies: A Li'L Tall Tale about America's Favorite Art Form |accessdate=8 May 2011 |year=2008 |publisher=CreateSpace |isbn=1438264127 |page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; Segar would later become famous for his character [[Popeye]], and his 'Chaplin' comics would later be collected in 1917 into five books, precursors of the later [[Comic book|comic book]] format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Inge |first=M.

* From September to November 1977 (just before Chaplin's death in December of that year), [[DePatie-Freleng Enterprises]] produced a cartoon series starring a Chaplin-like character called [[Baggy Pants and the Nitwits|Baggy Pants]].
* In 1985, Chaplin was honoured with his image on a [[List of people on stamps of the United Kingdom|postage stamp of the United Kingdom]], and in 1994 he appeared on a [[List of people on stamps of the United States|United States postage stamp]] designed by caricaturist [[Al Hirschfeld]].
* [[IBM]] ran a series of commercials for their [[personal computer]]s during the 1980s featuring a Chaplin impersonator.
* [[John Woo]] directed a parody film of Chaplin's &quot;The Kid&quot; called [[IMDbTitle:0082535|Hua ji shi dai (1981)]], also known as &quot;Laughing Times.&quot;

* In 1992, a film was made about Chaplin's life entitled ''[[Chaplin (film)|Chaplin]]'', directed by Oscar-winner [[Richard Attenborough]], and starring [[Robert Downey, Jr.]], in an Oscar-nominated performance, and [[Geraldine Chaplin]] playing the part of Charlie Chaplin's mother, her own grandmother.

==Filmography and current rights issues==
{{Main|Charlie Chaplin filmography}}
Chaplin wrote, directed, and starred in dozens of [[feature film]]s and [[short subject]]s. Highlights include ''[[The Immigrant]]'' (1917), ''[[The Gold Rush]]'' (1925), ''[[City Lights]]'' (1931), ''[[Modern Times (film)|Modern Times]]'' (1936), and ''[[The Great Dictator]]'' (1940), all of which have been selected for inclusion in the [[National Film Registry]]. Three of these films made the [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies]] and [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition)]] lists: ''The Gold Rush'', ''City Lights'', and ''Modern Times''.

A listing of the dozens of Chaplin films and alternate versions can be found in the [[Ted Okuda]]-David Maska book ''Charlie Chaplin at Keystone and Essanay: Dawn of the Tramp''. Thanks to The Chaplin Keystone Project, efforts to produce definitive versions of Chaplin's pre-1918 short films have come to a successful end: after ten years of research and clinical international cooperation work, 34 Keystone films have been fully restored and published in October 2010 on a 4-DVD box set. All twelve Mutual films were restored in 1975 by archivist [[David Shepard (film preservationist)|David Shepard]] and [[Blackhawk Films]], and new restorations with even more footage were released on DVD in 2006.

Today, nearly all of Chaplin's output is owned by Roy Export S.A.S. in Paris, which enforces the library's copyrights and decides how and when this material can be released. French company MK2 acts as worldwide distribution agent for the Export company. In the U.S. as of 2010, distribution is handled under license by [[Janus Films]], with home video releases from [[The Criterion Collection|Criterion Collection]], affiliated with Janus.

As of April 2011, ''The World Factbook'' consists of '''266''' entities.&lt;ref name=&quot;whatsnew&quot;/&gt; These entities can be divided into categories.&lt;ref name=&quot;ents&quot;&gt;{{cite web | author =  Directorate of Intelligence | title = The World Factbook - Notes and Definitions: Entities | url = https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/docs/notesanddefs.html | accessdate = 2008-02-29 | quote = &quot;Independent state&quot; refers to a people politically organized into a sovereign state with a definite territory. * * * There are a total of 266 separate geographic entities in The World Factbook that may be categorized as follows... }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are:

; Independent countries: This category has independent countries, which the CIA defines as people &quot;politically organized into a sovereign state with a definite territory&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ents&quot;/&gt; In this category, there are '''194''' entities.
; Others: The ''Other'' category is a list of other places set apart from the list of independent countries. Currently there are '''two''': [[Taiwan]] and the [[European Union]].
; Dependencies and Areas of Special Sovereignty: This category is a list of places affiliated with another country. They may be subdivided into categories using the country they are affiliated with:
:*[[Australia]]: six entities
:*[[China]]: two entities
:*[[Denmark]]: two entities
:*[[France]]: eight entities
:*[[Netherlands]]: three entities
:*[[New Zealand]]: three entities
:*[[Norway]]: three entities
:*[[United Kingdom]]: seventeen entities

; Miscellaneous: This category is for [[Antarctica]] and places in dispute. There are '''six''' entities.
; Other entities: This category is for the [[Earth|World]] and the [[ocean]]s. There are '''five''' oceans and the World (the World entry is intended as a summary of the other entries).&lt;ref name=press/&gt;

In June 2009, the US National Public Radio (NPR), relying on information obtained from the CIA World Factbook, put the number of Israeli Jews living in settlements in the West Bank and Israeli-annexed East Jerusalem at 250,000. However, a better estimate, based on [[United States Department of State|State Department]] and Israeli sources put the figure at about 500,000. NPR then issued a correction. Chuck Holmes, foreign editor for NPR Digitial, said, “I’m surprised and displeased, and it makes me wonder what other information is out-of-date or incorrect in the CIA World Factbook.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.npr.org/blogs/ombudsman/2010/06/01/127349281/cia-gets-the-numbers-wrong

This has been argued by some as misleading, and refers to the date the entity adopted its current name under the [[Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act]], of that year. Indeed it can be argued the country has never been independent since there is an arguable legitimate succession of states, systems and entities from the [[Norman Conquest]], 1066. It can also be argued that the United Kingdom has been independent since 410 AD, the year that the Romans left [[Roman Britain]].

A '''country''' is a [[geographic]]al region. A country may be the territory of a [[sovereign state]], the territory of a non-[[sovereignty|sovereign]] (or formerly sovereign) [[political division]], or a region associated with a certain [[nation|people]] or certain characteristics.

The degree of autonomy of non-sovereign countries varies widely. Some are possessions of sovereign states, as several states have overseas [[Dependent territory|dependencies]] (such as the [[British Virgin Islands]] ([[United Kingdom|GBR]]) and [[Saint Pierre and Miquelon]] ([[France|FRA]])), with territory and citizenry distinct from their own. Such dependent territories are sometimes listed together with sovereign states on lists of countries, and may be treated as a &quot;[[country of origin]]&quot; in international trade, as [[Hong Kong]] is.

Australia is the only country that consists of an entire continent.

==Etymology and usage==
The word ''country'' has developed from the [[Latin language|Latin]] ''contra'' meaning &quot;against&quot;, used in the sense of &quot;that which lies against, or opposite to, the view&quot;, i.e. the landscape spread out to the view. From this came the [[Late Latin]] term ''contrata'', which became the modern [[Italian language|Italian]] ''[[contrada]]''. The term appears in [[Middle English]] from the 13th century, already in several different senses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia| editor = John Simpson, Edmund Weiner | encyclopedia = Oxford English Dictionary| edition = 1971 compact | publisher = Oxford University Press| location = Oxford, England| isbn = 0198611862 |title = country}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In English the word has increasingly become associated with political divisions, so that one sense, associated with the [[indefinite article]] – &quot;a country&quot; – is now a [[synonym]] for [[Sovereign state|state]], or a former sovereign state, in the sense of sovereign territory.&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]], Country&lt;/ref&gt; Areas much smaller than a political state may be called by names such as the [[West Country]] in England, the [[Black Country]] (a heavily industrialized part of England), &quot;Constable Country&quot; (a part of [[East Anglia]] painted by [[John Constable]]), the &quot;big country&quot; (used in various contexts of the [[American West]]), &quot;coal country&quot; (used of parts of the US and elsewhere) and many other terms.&lt;ref name=&quot;oed&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia| editor = John Simpson, Edmund Weiner | encyclopedia = Oxford English Dictionary| edition = 1971 compact | publisher = Oxford University Press| location = Oxford, England| isbn = 0198611862}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The equivalent terms in French and [[Romance language]]s (''pays'' and variants) have not carried the process of being identified with political sovereign states as far as the English &quot;country&quot;, and in many European countries the words are used for sub-divisions of the national territory, as in the [[States of Germany|German Länder]], as well as a less formal term for a sovereign state. France has very many &quot;pays&quot; that are officially recognised at some level, and are either [[natural region]]s, like the [[Pays de Bray]], or reflect old political or economic unities, like the [[Pays de la Loire]]. At the same time Wales, the United States, and Brazil are also &quot;pays&quot; in everyday French speech.

A version of &quot;country&quot; can be found in the modern [[French language]] as ''contrée'', based on the word ''cuntrée'' in [[Old French]],&lt;ref name=&quot;oed&quot; /&gt; that is used similarly to the word &quot;pays&quot; to define regions and unities, but can also be used to describe a political state in some particular cases. The modern Italian ''contrada'' is a word with its meaning varying locally, but usually meaning a [[Ward (country subdivision)|ward]] or similar small division of a town, or a village or hamlet in the countryside.
Examples can be Cape Verde and India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/countries.html|title=Countries}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Copenhagen''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|k|oʊ|p|ən|h|eɪ|ɡ|ən}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|oʊ|p|ən|h|ɑː|ɡ|ən}}; {{lang-da|København}} {{IPA-da|kʰøb̥m̩ˈhɑʊ̯ˀn|pron|Da-København.ogg}}) is the capital and largest city of [[Denmark]], with an [[urban area|urban]] population of 1,199,224 (January 1, 2011) and a [[metropolitan area|metropolitan]] population of 1,918,062 (April 1, 2011). Copenhagen is situated on the islands of [[Zealand]] and [[Amager]].

First documented in the 11th century, Copenhagen became the capital of Denmark in the beginning of the 15th century. During the 17th century, under the reign of [[Christian IV of Denmark|Christian IV]], it became a significant regional centre. With the completion of the transnational [[Øresund Bridge]] in 2000, Copenhagen has become the centre of the increasingly integrating [[Øresund Region|Oresund Region]]. Within this region, Copenhagen and the [[Sweden|Swedish]] city of [[Malmö]] are growing into a combined [[metropolitan area]].

Copenhagen is a major regional centre of [[culture]], [[business]], [[Mass media|media]], and [[science]], as indicated by several international surveys and rankings (see [[#International rankings|International rankings]] below). [[Biology|Life science]], [[information technology]] and [[shipping]] are important sectors and [[research and development|research &amp; development]] plays a major role in the city's economy. Its strategic location and excellent infrastructure, with the largest airport in Scandinavia&lt;ref name=&quot;waymarking1&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WM3N4X|title=Copenhagen Airport|publisher=waymarking.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; located 14 minutes by train from the city centre, have made it a regional hub and a popular location for regional headquarters&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ambottawa.um.dk/en/servicemenu/News/Copenhagen+region+ranks+3rd+in+western+EuropeForAttractingHeadOffices.htm|title=Copenhagen Region Ranks 3rd in Western Europe for Attracting Head Offices |publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark|date=2009-01-06|accessdate=2009-07-24|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080509015917/http://www.ambottawa.um.dk/en/servicemenu/News/Copenhagen+region+ranks+3rd+in+western+EuropeForAttractingHeadOffices.htm|archivedate=9 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Convention (meeting)|conventions]].

Copenhagen has repeatedly been recognized as one of the cities with the best quality of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.investindk.com/visArtikel.asp?artikelID=8130|title=A great place to live|publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;iht2007&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/06/18/arts/rmon2copenhagen.php|title=Copenhagen is Scandinavia's most desirable city|publisher=International Herald Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.forbes.com/2008/07/21/cities-europe-lifestyle-forbeslife-cx_vr_0721europe.html|title=Europe's 10 Best Places To Live|publisher=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also considered one of the world's most [[environmentally friendly]] cities. The water in the inner harbour is so clean that one can swim in it, and 36% of all citizens commute to work by bicycle. Every day they cycle a combined 1.2 million km.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kk.dk/sitecore/content/Subsites/CityOfCopenhagen/SubsiteFrontpage/CitizenInformation/CityAndTraffic/CityOfCyclists.aspx|title=Copenhagen – City of Cyclists|publisher=City of Copenhagen}}{{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the turn of the millennium, Copenhagen has seen a strong urban and cultural development and has been described as a boom town.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wissen.spiegel.de/wissen/image/show.html?did=57570816&amp;aref=image037/2008/06/21/ROSPC200800400660071.PDF&amp;thumb=false|title=Cool Boom Towns|publisher=Spiegel Special}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is partly due to massive investments in cultural facilities as well as infrastructure and a new wave of successful designers, chefs and architects.&lt;ref name=&quot;iht2007&quot;/&gt; As of 2010, Copenhagen is ranked as the 10th [[List of most expensive cities for expatriate employees|most expensive city]] in the world according to ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forbes.com/2010/06/28/most-expensive-cities-lifestyle-travel-expats_slide_2.html Forbes: The World's Most Expensive Cities For Expats]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|History of Copenhagen}}

Copenhagen's founding has traditionally been dated to [[Absalon|Bishop Absalon]]'s construction of a castle on the small island of [[Slotsholmen]] in 1167 where [[Christiansborg Palace]] stands today. Recent archeological finds indicate that by the 11th century, Copenhagen had already grown into a small town with a large estate, a church, a market, at least two wells and many smaller habitations spread over a fairly wide area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.videnskab.dk/content/dk/kultur/kobenhavn_var_en_storby_lange_for_absalon/arkaologer_graver_ny_teori_om_kobenhavn_op_af_mulden Arkæologer graver ny teori om København op af mulden (Archeologists develop new theory about Copenhagen from their digs), Videnskab.dk, 5 November 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; Many historians believe that the town dates to the late Viking age, and was possibly founded by [[Sweyn Forkbeard|Sweyn I Forkbeard]]. From the middle of the 12th century it grew in importance, after coming into Absolon's possession, who fortified it in 1167, the year traditionally marking the foundation of Copenhagen. The excellent [[harbor|harbour]] encouraged Copenhagen's growth until it became an important centre of commerce. However it did not become the nation's [[Capital city|capital]] until the middle of the 15th century, and the archbishop still has residence in [[Roskilde]]. 

The city's origin as a harbour and a place of commerce is reflected in its name. Its original designation, from which the contemporary Danish name is derived, was ''Køpmannæhafn'', meaning &quot;merchants' harbour&quot; or &quot;buyer's haven&quot;. The English name for the city is derived from its [[Low German]] name, ''Kopenhagen''. The element [[hafnium]] is also named for Copenhagen, whose [[Latin]] name is ''Hafnia'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1943/hevesy-bio.html Biography of George de Hevesy]&lt;/ref&gt; derived from the city's original name, ''Hafnæ'' (&quot;harbour&quot;).

As the town rose in prominence, it was repeatedly attacked by the [[Hanseatic League]]. In 1254 it received its charter as a city under Bishop [[Jakob Erlandsen]]. During 1658–59 it withstood a siege by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] under [[Charles X Gustav of Sweden|Charles X]] and successfully repelled [[Assault on Copenhagen (1659)|a major assault]]. In 1711 the [[Black Death|plague]] reduced Copenhagen's population of about 65,000 by one-third.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;''[http://books.google.com/books?id=gxgNAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA10&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Copenhagen]''&quot;.

On 2 April 1801 a [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] fleet under the command of [[Hyde Parker (admiral)|Admiral Sir Hyde Parker]] defeated a [[Denmark–Norway|Danish-Norwegian]] [[Royal Dano-Norwegian Navy|fleet]] anchored near Copenhagen.

The [[Battle of Copenhagen (1807)|Second Battle of Copenhagen]] (or the Bombardment of Copenhagen) (16 August – 5 September 1807) was from a British point of view a [[preemptive war|preemptive attack]] on Copenhagen, targeting the civilian population in order to seize the [[Royal Dano-Norwegian Navy|Dano-Norwegian fleet]].&lt;ref name=&quot;HistoryWorld&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;TimesOnline&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=smith&gt;Smith, D. ''The Greenhill Napoleonic Wars Data Book''. Greenhill Books, 1998, p. 204&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Defying&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thomasmunch-petersen.info/Welcome_files/preface.pdf |title=Defying Napoleon (preface)|publisher=The History Press Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt; But from a Danish point of view the battle was a terror bombardment on their capital. Particularly notable was the use of incendiary [[Congreve rocket]]s (containing phosphorus, which cannot be extinguished with water) that randomly hit the city. Few houses with straw roofs remained after the bombardment. The largest church, ''Vor frue kirke'', was destroyed by the sea artillery. The battle was called &quot;the first terror attack against a major European city in modern times&quot; by historian Thomas Munch-Petersen.&lt;ref name=&quot;Defying&quot;/&gt;

The British landed 30,000 men and surrounded Copenhagen.&lt;ref name=&quot;HistoryWorld&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;TimesOnline&quot;/&gt; The attack continued for the next three days, killing some 2,000 civilians and destroying most of the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;HistoryWorld&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;TimesOnline&quot;/&gt; The devastation was so great because Copenhagen relied on an [[Fortifications of Copenhagen|old defence-line]] whose limited range could not reach the British ships and their [[Range of a projectile|longer-range]] artillery.&lt;ref&gt;Wendy Hinde, ''George Canning'' (Purnell Books Services, 1973), p. 168&lt;/ref&gt; Not until the 1850s were the ramparts of the city opened to allow new housing to be built around [[The Lakes, Copenhagen|The Lakes]] ({{lang-da|Søerne}}) that bordered the old defences to the west. This dramatic increase of space was long overdue, because the old ramparts were out of date as a defence system, and because of bad [[sanitation]] in the old city. Before the opening, central Copenhagen was inhabited by approximately 125,000 people, peaking in the census of 1870 (140,000); today the figure is around 25,000. In 1901, Copenhagen expanded further, incorporating communities with 40,000 people, and in the process making [[Frederiksberg Municipality|Frederiksberg]] an [[enclave and exclave|enclave]] within Copenhagen.

During [[World War II]], Copenhagen was [[Occupation of Denmark|occupied by German troops]] along with the rest of the country from 9 April 1940 until 4 May 1945. The occupation was not a part of the Nazi German expansion, and in the first years German authorities wanted a kind of understanding with the Danish government. Even a general parliamentary election was granted in 1941, with only the [[Communist Party of Denmark|Communist Party]] excluded. But in August 1943, when the government's collaboration with the occupation forces collapsed, several ships were scuttled in Copenhagen Harbour by the [[Royal Danish Navy]] to prevent their use by the Germans. Around that time the Nazis [[Racial policy of Nazi Germany|started to arrest Jews]], although many managed to escape to [[Sweden]].

After the [[Invasion of Normandy|Normandy invasion]] the Germans feared that the Danish police could become a problem, and in early September 1944 the entire Danish police force was meant to be arrested. But a majority of the Danish police managed to either hide or escape to Sweden. Out of 2,000 policemen captured and deported to Germany fewer than half returned after the war. During the last eight months of occupation Copenhagen suffered a high rate of common criminality.

Ole Lippman, the leader of the [[Special Operations Executive|Danish resistance movement (SOE)]], asked for [[RAF]] assistance in attacking Nazi headquarters in Copenhagen. Accordingly, vice [[Air Marshall]] [[Basil Embry|Sir Basil Embry]] drew the plans for a spectacular precision attack on the [[Sicherheitsdienst|SD]] and [[Gestapo]] building, the former office of the [[Shell Oil Company]]. Political prisoners were kept in the attic to prevent an air raid, so the RAF had to bomb the lower levels of the building. The attack came on 22 March 1945, coming in three small waves. All six planes (carrying one bomb each) in the first wave hit their target, but unfortunately one of the aircraft crashed near Frederiksberg girls school. Due to this crash four of the planes in the two following waves assumed the school was the target, and aim their bombs at the school. Several teachers and some 15 students were killed, but 18 (of 20 total) political prisoners managed to escape, the Gestapo archives were completely destroyed, and Hitler became so insecure of the situation that he withdrew only half of the roughly 200,000 soldiers in Denmark to reinforce German forces on the Rhine.&lt;ref&gt;RAF instruction film for precision bombing number 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;SFINX film/TV documentary &quot;Sangbogen og de røde sko&quot; (containing parts of the RAF precision bombing instruction film number 6) by Katia Forbert Petersen, produced by Anette Mari Olsen.

Since the summer of 2000, Copenhagen and the Swedish city of [[Malmö]] have been connected by a toll bridge/tunnel ([[Oresund Bridge|Øresund Bridge]]), which carries railroad and automobile traffic. As a result, Copenhagen has become the centre of a larger metropolitan area which spans both nations. The construction of the bridge has led to many changes to the public [[transport network|transport system]] and extensive redevelopment of [[Amager]], south of Copenhagen.

In December 2009 Copenhagen hosted the worldwide climate meeting [[COP15]]. When US President [[Barack Obama]] participated in the end of this meeting it was the fourth time an American President had visited Copenhagen during his term (Obama also visited Copenhagen in October 2009, [[George W. Bush]] in 2005 and [[Bill Clinton]] in the 1990s).

==Geography==
===Location===
[[File:Copenhagen town hall total back.jpg|thumb|[[Copenhagen City Hall]]]]
[[File:Kongens Nytorv, Copenhagen.jpg|thumb|[[Kongens Nytorv|King's New Square]]]]
Copenhagen is located on the eastern shore of the [[island]] of [[Zealand (Denmark)|Zealand ''(Sjælland)'']], partly on the island of [[Amager]] and on a number of natural and artificial islets between the two. Copenhagen faces the [[Øresund]] to the east, the strait of water that separates Denmark from [[Sweden]], and which connects the [[North Sea]] with the [[Baltic Sea]]. The [[Sweden|Swedish]] towns of [[Malmö]] and [[Landskrona]] lie on the Swedish side of the sound directly across from Copenhagen.

Copenhagen is part of the [[Øresund]] region, which consists of Zealand, Lolland-Falster and Bornholm in Denmark and [[Scania]] in [[Sweden]].

===Copenhagen Municipality===
[[Copenhagen Municipality]] is an administrative unit which covers the central part of the actual city of Copenhagen. It is a fairly small part of the actual city which falls within the municipality both because it covers a confined area and because the enclave of [[Frederiksberg Municipality|Frederiksberg]] is an independent municipality. Since a reform in 2006–08, Copenhagen is divided into 10 official districts (Danish: Bydele).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kk.dk/FaktaOmKommunen/KoebenhavnITalOgOrd/StatistikOmKoebenhavnOgKoebenhavnere/Kort/KoebenhavnsBydele.aspx|title=Københavns bydele|publisher=Københavns Kommune|accessdate=2009-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The suffix ''-bro'' in the names Østerbro, Nørrebro, Vesterbro and Amagerbro should not be confused with the Danish word for ''bridge'', which is also 'bro'. The term is thought to be an [[abbreviation]] or short form of the Danish word ''brolagt'' meaning ''paved'' referring to the roads paved with cobblestones leading to the city's former gates.

===Greater Copenhagen===
The [[conurbation]] of Copenhagen consists of several municipalities. After [[Copenhagen Municipality]], the second largest is [[Frederiksberg Municipality]], an enclave inside Copenhagen Municipality. Both are contained in the larger [[Capital Region of Denmark]], containing most of the [[Metropolitan Copenhagen|Copenhagen metropolitan area]].

Previously, the areas of [[Frederiksberg Municipality|Frederiksberg]], [[Gentofte Municipality|Gentofte]] and Copenhagen municipalities have been used to define the city of Copenhagen. This definition is now obsolete. To meet [[statistics|statistical]] needs upon the latest municipal reform, which took place in early 2007, a definitory concept of Danish ''lands'' ({{lang-da|landsdele}}) was introduced. A land is basically a geographical and statistical definition, and the area is not considered to be an administrative unit. The land of Copenhagen City includes the municipalities of Copenhagen, [[Dragør Municipality|Dragør]], Frederiksberg and [[Tårnby Municipality|Tårnby]], with a total population of 692,876 at the start of 2011.&lt;ref name=&quot;StatDen Pop 080101&quot;&gt;[http://www.statistikbanken.dk/BEF1A07 Statistics Denmark, table BEF1A07: Population 1 January by region, age, sex, marital status]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;StatDen Lands&quot;&gt;[http://www.dst.dk/upload/landsdele.xls Statistics Denmark, definitions of lands as of 2007-01-01 ('''excel-file, in Danish''')]&lt;/ref&gt;

Copenhagen and Frederiksberg were two of the three last Danish municipalities not belonging to a [[Counties of Denmark|county]]. On 1 January 2007, the municipalities lost their county privileges and became part of [[Capital Region of Denmark|Copenhagen Capital Region]].

====Finger Plan====
Suburban Copenhagen is planned according to the [[Finger Plan]] ({{lang-da|Fingerplanen}}), initiated in 1947, dividing the suburbs into five fingers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.denmark.dk/en/menu/About-Denmark/Society/Economy-Production/Infrastructure/TheFingerPlan/ The Finger Plan], Denmark.dk&lt;/ref&gt; The [[S-train]] lines are built according to the Finger Plan, while green wedges and highways are built between the fingers.

===Climate===
Copenhagen is in the [[oceanic climate]] zone, bordering on a [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Dfb''). As the city is in the path of Atlantic low-pressure systems, Copenhagen experiences unstable and changing weather patterns in all four seasons, as well as temperatures about 5 degrees higher than average for its latitude (55 degrees North) worldwide. The main reason for this warmth is the Atlantic [[Gulf Stream]], which moves warm water from around Gulf Coast area toward Europe, and the [[Low-pressure area|low-pressure systems]] follow with the oceanic stream.

Precipitation is moderate throughout the year, with a small peak during June to August. Snowfall occurs mainly from late December until early March, but snow cover seldom lasts long. Rain during January and February is as common as snow, and the average temperatures for these two winter months is near the [[Melting point|freezing point]].

During winter, the weather is dependent on which latitude the [[Low-pressure area|Atlantic low pressure centre]] takes. With a stable high-pressure system around the [[Alps]], the low pressure from the southwest moves toward southern [[Scandinavia]] and northern [[Germany]], producing above-freezing temperatures day and night. When a stable high-pressure system sits over Denmark or the lands to the northeast (such as [[Finland]] or [[Russia]]), the mild Atlantic winds from the southwest are blocked, allowing polar winds to cover the area, and the temperature dips to below freezing (rarely below {{convert|-5|°C|0|abbr=on|lk=on}} during the day and {{convert|-12|°C|0|abbr=on}} during the night). If the European continent experiences cold due to the eastern Russian winds, which rarely occurs, it can &quot;freeze from the south&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} This was a phenomenon that took several centuries to understand.

Spring is comparable to continental Europe, but delayed about a week because of the cold surrounding water. On the other hand, in late autumn Copenhagen is kept milder due to the same factor, but reversed. In late November and December the surrounding ocean water is generally warmer than the air. From mid-October to February, one or two storms (or even hurricanes) occur. Storms in the summertime are rare.

Summer is a mixture of southwestern mild, windy and rainy low-pressure systems, and periods of stable high pressures. In summer, high-pressure systems usually bring sunny and fairly warm weather. But these warm periods, which can occur any time from late April until mid September, usually last no longer than ten days.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

==Cityscape==
[[File:Metropolis, Copenhagen 3.jpg|thumb|Metropolis building]]
The city's appearance today is shaped by the key role it has played as a regional centre for centuries. Copenhagen has a multitude of districts, each representing its time and with its own distinctive character, making up a dense urban fabric. Other distinctive features of Copenhagen include the abundance of water, the many parks, and the [[Segregated cycle facilities|bicycle paths]] that line most streets.

===Architecture===
{{See also|Architecture in Copenhagen|List of buildings in and around Copenhagen}}
[[File:Marble Church front.jpg|thumb|left|[[Frederik's Church|The Marble Church]]]]
The oldest section of Copenhagen's [[inner city]] is often referred to as &quot;Middelalderbyen&quot; (The [[Middle Ages|Medieval]] City). However, the most distinctive district of Copenhagen is [[Frederiksstaden]] developed during the reign of [[Frederick V of Denmark|Frederick V]]. It has [[Amalienborg Palace]] at its centre and is dominated by the dome of the [[Frederik's Church|Marble Church]] and several elegant 18th century mansions. The old inner city of Copenhagen includes the small island of [[Slotsholmen]] with [[Christiansborg Palace]] and [[Christianshavn]]. Around the historical city centre lies a band of congenial residential bouroughs (Vesterbro, Inner Nørrebro, Inner Østerbro) dating mainly from late 19th century. They were built outside the old ramparts of the city when the city was finally allowed to expand beyond this barrier.

Sometimes referred to as &quot;the City of Spires&quot;, Copenhagen is known for its horizontal skyline, only broken by spires at churches and castles. Most characteristic is the [[baroque]] spire of [[Church of Our Saviour, Copenhagen|Church of Our Saviour]] with its spiralling and narrowing external stairs that visitors can climb to the very top of the spire. Other important spires are those of [[Christiansborg Palace]], the [[Copenhagen City Hall|City Hall]] and the former Church of St. Nikolaj that now houses a [[modern art]] venue. A bit lower are the [[renaissance]] spires of [[Rosenborg Castle]] and the &quot;dragon spire&quot; of [[Børsen|Christian IV's former stock exchange]], so named because it resembles the tails of four dragons twined together.
[[File:RadissonSASRoyalHotelKopenhagen.jpg|thumb|right|230px|The 1960 [[Radisson Blu Royal Hotel, Copenhagen|Radisson Blu Royal Hotel]] by [[Arne Jacobsen]]]]
Recent years have seen a boom in modern [[architecture]] in Copenhagen&lt;ref name=&quot;baumeister1&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.baumeister.de/|title=B1 Kopenhagen entdecken|publisher=Baumeister – Zeitschrift für Architektur}}&lt;/ref&gt; both when it comes to [[Architecture of Denmark|Danish architecture]] and works by international architects. For a few hundred years, virtually no foreign architects had worked in Copenhagen but since the turn of the millennium the city and its immediate sourroundings have seen buildings and projects from international star architects. In the same time, a number of Danish architects have achieved success in Copenhagen and abroad. Buildings in Copenhagen have won [[Royal Institute of British Architects|RIBA European Awards]] four years in a row (&quot;Sampension&quot; in 2005,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.e-architect.co.uk/awards/riba_awards_2005.htm|title=RIBA European Awards 2005|publisher=RIBA}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Kilen&quot; in 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.architecture.com/Awards/RIBAEuropeanAwards/2006/Kilen/KilenDenmark.aspx|title=RIBA European Awards 2006|publisher=RIBA}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Tietgenkollegiet&quot; in 2007&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.amblondon.um.dk/en/menu/TheEmbassy/News/RIBAAwardsToDanishArchitects.htm|title=RIBA European Awards 2007|publisher=RIBA}}{{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Royal Danish Playhouse|Royal Playhouse]] in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.architecture.com/Awards/RIBAEuropeanAwards/2008/RoyalPlayhouse.aspx|title=RIBA European Awards 2009|publisher=RIBA}}&lt;/ref&gt;) The last three mentioned projects are all by Lundgaard &amp; Tranberg Architects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ltarkitekter.dk/ Lundgaard &amp; Tranberg Architects]&lt;/ref&gt; At the 2008 [[World Architecture Festival]] in Barcelona, [[Bjarke Ingels|Bjarke Ingels Group]] won an award for the World's Best Residential Building 2008 for a house in Ørestad.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldarchitecturefestival.com/news-detail.cfm?newsId=33|title=World's Best Residential Building 2008|publisher=World Architecture Festival}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Forum AID Award for Best building in Scandinavia went to Copenhagen buildings both in 2006&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.forumaid.com/default.asp?sid=1207|title=Controversial residential housing complex year’s best building|publisher=Forum AID}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.designboom.com/weblog/read.php?CATEGORY_PK=&amp;TOPIC_PK=2388|title=Ørestad Gymnasium Best Building in Scandinavia 2008|publisher=designboom}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 British design magazine [[Monocle (2007 magazine)|Monocle]] named Copenhagen the ''World's best design city 2008''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/copenhagen-probably-the-best-city-in-the-world-842782.html|title=World's best design city 2008|publisher=The Independent|location=London|first=Emily|last=Dugan|date=2008-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The boom in [[urban planning|urban development]] and [[modern architecture]] has brought some changes to the city's skyline. A political majority has decided to keep the historical centre free of high-rise buildings, but several areas will see or have already seen massive urban development. [[Ørestad]] now has seen most of the recent development. Located near [[Copenhagen Airport]], it currently boasts one of the largest malls in Scandinavia and a variety of office and residential buildings as well as [[IT University of Copenhagen|IT University]] and a high school. The two largest hotels in Scandinavia are currently under construction (ultimo 2008).

An ambitious regeneration project will create a new [[Carlsberg (district)|Carlsberg District]] at the historical premises of the [[Carlsberg Group|Carlsberg Breweries]] that has terminated the production of beer in Copenhagen and moved it to [[Fredericia]]. The district will have a total of nine high-rise buildings and seeks to mix the old industrial buildings with modern architecture to create a dense, maze-like quarter with a focus on [[sustainability]] and an active [[urban life]]. A third major area of urban development also with a focus on sustanibility is [[Nordhavn]]. The Copenhagen tradition with urban development on [[artificial island]]s that was initiated with [[Christian IV of Denmark|Christian IV]]'s construction of [[Christianshavn]] has recently been continued with the creation of [[Havneholmen]] as well as a [[Sluseholmen Canal District|canal district]] at [[Sluseholmen]] in the [[Kongens Enghave|South Harbour]]. A district in Copenhagen with a different take on modern architecture is that of [[Freetown Christiania|Christiania]] whose many creative and idiosyncratic buildings are exponents of an &quot;architecture without architects&quot;.

===Parks===
{{Main|Parks and open spaces in Copenhagen}}
[[File:Koebenhavn Oerstedsparken 2009 ubt.JPG|thumb|left|[[Ørstedsparken]]]]
Copenhagen is a green city with many big and small parks. [[Rosenborg Castle Gardens|King's Garden]], the garden of [[Rosenborg Castle]], is the oldest and most visited park in Copenhagen.&lt;ref name=&quot;www1&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ses.dk/392755f0|title=King's Garden|publisher=Slots- og Ejeondomsstyrelsen|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080329224035/http://www.ses.dk/392755f0|archivedate=29 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its landscaping was commenced by [[Christian IV of Denmark|Christian IV]] in 1606. Every year it sees more than 2.5 million visitors&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aok.dk/byen-rundt/kongens-have|title=Kongens Have|publisher=AOK}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the summer months it is packed with sunbathers, picnickers and ballplayers. It serves as a [[sculpture garden]] with a permanent display of sculptures as well as temporary exhibits during summer.&lt;ref name=&quot;www1&quot;/&gt; Also located in the city centre are the [[University of Copenhagen Botanical Garden|Botanical Gardens]] particularly noted for their large complex of 19th century greenhouses donated by [[Carlsberg Group|Carlsberg]] founder [[J. C. Jacobsen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.carlsbergdanmark.dk/omos/Historie/IJacobsensfodspor/Kobenhavn/Pages/BotaniskHave.aspx|title=Botanisk Have|publisher=Carlsberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fælledparken]] is at 58 [[hectare]]s the largest park in Copenhagen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aok.dk/byen-rundt/faelledparken |title=Fælledparken|publisher=AOK}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is popular for [[sport]]s and hosts several annual events such as a free opera concert at the opening of the opera season, other open-air concerts, [[carnival]], [[Labour Day]] celebrations and [[Copenhagen Historic Grand Prix]], which is a race for [[antique car]]s. A historical [[green belt|green space]] in the northeastern part of the city is [[Kastellet, Copenhagen|Kastellet]], a well-preserved renaissance [[citadel]] that now serves mainly as a park. Another popular park is the [[Frederiksberg Park|Frederiksberg Garden]], a 32-hectare [[romanticism|romantic]] [[landscape garden|landscape park]]. It houses a colony of tame [[Grey Heron|grey herons]] and other [[waterfowl]]. The park offers views of the elephants and the elephant house designed by world-famous British architect [[Norman Foster (architect)|Norman Foster]] of the adjacent [[Copenhagen Zoo]].

In Copenhagen, many [[cemetery|cemeteries]] double as parks, though only for the more quiet activities such as sunbathing, reading and meditation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ibyen.dk/article241086.ece|title=København får mere liv på kirkegårdene|publisher=Politiken}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Assistens Cemetery (Copenhagen)|Assistens Cemetery]], the burial place of [[Hans Christian Andersen]], is an important green space for the district of [[Nørrebro|Inner Nørrebro]] and a Copenhagen institution. The lesser known [[Vestre Cemetery|Vestre Kirkegaard]] is the largest (54 hectares) cemetery in Denmark&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ibyen.dk/guide/article327680.ece|title=Guide: Gå på opdagelse i de dødes haver|publisher=Politiken}}&lt;/ref&gt; and offers a maze of dense groves, open lawns, winding paths, hedges, overgrown [[tomb]]s, monuments, tree-lined avenues, lakes and other [[List of garden features|garden feature]]s.

It is official municipal policy in Copenhagen that all citizens by 2015 must be able to reach a park or beach on foot in less than 15 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.br.kk.dk/Politik%20og%20Demokrati/IPolitiskFokus/Miljoemetropolen/EnGronOgBlaaStorby.aspx|title=En grøn og blå storby|publisher=Københavns Kommune|accessdate=2009-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In line with this policy, several new parks are under development in areas lacking green spaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dezeen.com/2008/10/05/suk-project-by-big-architects/|title=Superkilen by Bjarke Ingels Group|publisher=Dezeen|accessdate=2009-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www2.kk.dk/kvarterloeft/pegasus.nsf/url/nordvest|title=&quot;1001 Træ&quot;, Nordvest|publisher=Københavns Kommune}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Beaches===
Copenhagen and the surrounding areas have 3 beaches with a total of approx. 8&amp;nbsp;km of sandy [[beach]]es within 30 minutes cycling from the city centre. This includes [[Amager Strandpark]], which opened in 2005 and includes a 2&amp;nbsp;km long artificial island and a total of 4.6&amp;nbsp;km of beaches,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gomotion.dk/pe1.asp?p_id=335|title=Hot spot på Amager Strandpark|publisher=gomotion.dk|accessdate=2009-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; located just 15 minutes by bicycle or a few minutes by metro from the city centre.

The beaches are supplemented by a system of [[Copenhagen Harbour Baths|Harbour Baths]] along the Copenhagen waterfront. The first and most popular of these is located at [[Islands Brygge]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.e-architect.co.uk/copenhagen/copenhagen_havnebad.htm Harbour bath at Islands Brygge], e-architect&lt;/ref&gt; and has won international acclaim for its design.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.architecture-page.com/go/people/profiles/bjarke-ingels-group|title=2007 IOC Honorable Mention|publisher=ap architecture-page|accessdate=2009-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==
As of 2010, 78.4% of Copenhagen's population is [[Danes|Danish]], 7.0% are immigrants from western countries and 14.47% of a non-Western background.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kk.dk/FaktaOmKommunen/KoebenhavnITalOgOrd/StatistikOmKoebenhavnOgKoebenhavnere/StatistikPaaBydele/BefolkningOgFremskrivninger.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sluseholmen canal scene 2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The [[Sluseholmen Canal District]]]]
Depending on the boundaries used, the population of Copenhagen differs. [[Statistics Denmark]] uses a measure of the contiguously built-up urban area of Copenhagen, this means the number of communities included in this statistical abstract has changed several times, in the abstracts latest edition with about 1.2 million (1,199,224 (2011)) inhabitants. This number is not a strict result of the commonly used measuring methods of 200 meters of continuously build-up area, as there are exceptions to the general rule: The suburbs of [[Birkerød]] and [[Hørsholm]] are excluded, while all of [[Brøndby Municipality|Brøndby]] and parts of [[Ishøj Municipality|Ishøj]] and [[Greve Municipality|Greve]] are included.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Statistics Denmark has never stated the geographical area of urban Copenhagen. However, we know it consists of [[Copenhagen Municipality]], [[Frederiksberg Municipality|Frederiksberg]] and 16 of the 20 municipalities in the old counties [[Copenhagen County|Copenhagen]] and [[Roskilde County|Roskilde]], though 5 of them only partially.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dst.dk/pukora/epub/Nyt/2007/NR415.pdf Danmarks Statistik], Largest cities of Denmark 2007 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Statistics Denmark has worked out definitions of so-called lands (''landsdele''), a definition used to meet statistical needs on a lower level than regions. From this, the land of Copenhagen city (''København by'') is defined by the municipalities of Copenhagen, [[Dragør Municipality|Dragør]], [[Frederiksberg Municipality|Frederiksberg]] and [[Tårnby Municipality|Tårnby]], with a total population of 667,228 in the beginning of 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;StatDen Pop 080101&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;StatDen Lands&quot; /&gt; The surroundings of Copenhagen is defined by another land, Copenhagen suburban (''Københavns omegn''), which includes the municipalities of [[Albertslund]], [[Ballerup Municipality|Ballerup]], [[Brøndby Municipality|Brøndby]], [[Gentofte Municipality|Gentofte]], [[Gladsaxe Municipality|Gladsaxe]], [[Glostrup]], [[Herlev]], [[Hvidovre]], [[Høje-Taastrup Municipality|Høje-Taastrup]], [[Ishøj Municipality|Ishøj]], [[Lyngby-Taarbæk Municipality|Lyngby-Taarbæk]], [[Rødovre Municipality|Rødovre]] and [[Vallensbæk Municipality|Vallensbæk]], and with a total population of 508,183 (January 1, 2009).&lt;ref name=&quot;StatDen Pop 080101&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;StatDen Lands&quot; /&gt; This gives a total population of 1,171,709 for these two lands together. The lands of Copenhagen city and Copenhagen suburban can together be used as a definition of the metropolitan area, although perhaps a somewhat narrow one.

From 1 January 2009 the population of the 34 municipalities closest to and including the municipality of Copenhagen is 1.875.179.&lt;ref&gt;Statistikbanken.dk Population table BEF1A07&lt;/ref&gt; Land area: 2,923&amp;nbsp;km². (Capital Region – Bornholm + East Zealand + Stevns) .&lt;ref&gt;Orienteering fra Københavns Kommune. Statistisk Kontor.2003 nr. 25&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the region comprises 6.8% of the land area of Denmark, but has 34% of Denmark's population. This gives a total of 667 inhabitants per km² or 1,660 per square mile for the region. This compares with a population density in the rest of the country of approximately 90 per km² or around 230 per square mile.

Based on a 10%-isoline (data from 2002) in which at least 10% commutes into central parts of the Copenhagen area, most of Zealand would be covered and this area has a population of about 2.3 million inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bvl.aau.dk/dansk/fase1/plancher/pendler_hreg.jpg Andel af befolkningen der pendler til den centrale del a HUR-området]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the opening of the [[Oresund Bridge|Øresund Bridge]] in 2000, commuting between and integration of [[Greater Malmö]] and Copenhagen have increased rapidly, and a combined statistical [[metropolitan area]] has formed. This combined metropolitan area has a population of 2,488,551 (2009).

A high-ranking [[civil service|civil servant]] of the [[Ministry of Social Welfare (Denmark)|Interior Ministry]], Henning Strøm, who was involved in (i.e. known as &quot;the Father of&quot;) a past municipal reform, which took effect on 1 April 1970, said on television, broadcast in connection with the recent [[Municipalities of Denmark#Municipal Reform 2007|''Kommunalreformen'' (&quot;The Municipal Reform&quot; of 2007)]], that Copenhagen municipality would encompass an area with 1.5 million inhabitants, if the principles of the 1970 municipal reform were also applied on Copenhagen municipality.&lt;ref&gt;DR netnews 25-06-04&lt;/ref&gt; In other words: in the rest of Denmark the ''city'' occupies only part of the municipality, but in Copenhagen the ''municipality'' of Copenhagen occupies only part of the city of Copenhagen.

==Culture and recreation==
Since the late 1990s, Copenhagen has undergone a transformation from a cozy Scandinavian capital to a cool metropolitan city of international scope in the league of cities like [[Barcelona]] and [[Amsterdam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wissen.spiegel.de/wissen/image/show.html?did=57570816&amp;aref=image037/2008/06/21/ROSPC200800400660071.PDF&amp;thumb=false|title=Cool Boom Towns|publisher=Spiegel Special|accessdate=2009-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is due to massive investments in infrastructure as well as culture and a wave of new successful Danish architects, designers and chefs.&lt;ref name=&quot;iht2007&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;baumeister1&quot;/&gt;

===Museums===
{{See also|List of museums in and around Copenhagen}}

===Performing Arts===
[[File:Neues Schauspielhaus und neue Oper Kopenhagen am Abend.JPG|thumb|left|[[Copenhagen Opera House]] as seen from the [[Royal Danish Playhouse|Royal Playhouse]]]]

The new [[Copenhagen Concert Hall]] opened in January 2009. It is designed by [[Jean Nouvel]] and has four halls with the main [[auditorium]] seating 1800 people. It serves as the home of the [[Danish National Symphony Orchestra]] and along with the [[Walt Disney Concert Hall]] in Los Angeles the most expensive concert hall ever built.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.berlingske.dk/article/20070209/danmark/102090998/|title=DRs koncerthus – et af verdens dyreste|publisher=Berlingske Tidende|accessdate=2009-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another important venue for [[classical music]] is the [[Tivoli Gardens#Tivoli Concert Hall|Tivoli Concert Hall]] located in the historical [[Tivoli Gardens]]. The [[Copenhagen Opera House]] (in Danish usually called Operaen) that opened in 2005 and is designed by [[Henning Larsen]], is the national opera house of Denmark and among the most modern opera houses in the world. The old [[Royal Danish Theatre]] dating from 1748 still works as a supplementary opera scene. The Royal Danish Theatre is also home to the [[Royal Danish Ballet]]. Founded in 1748 along with the theatre, it is one of the oldest ballet troupes in Europe. It is home to the [[Bournonville School|Bournonville style]] of ballet.

Copenhagen has a significant [[jazz]] scene that has existed for many years. It developed when a number of [[United States|American]] [[List of jazz musicians|jazz musician]]s such as [[Ben Webster]], [[Thad Jones]], [[Richard B. Boone|Richard Boone]], Ernie Wilkins, [[Kenny Drew]], [[Ed Thigpen]], Bob Rockwell, [[Dexter Gordon]], and others such as [[guitarist|rock guitarist]] [[Link Wray]] came to live in Copenhagen during the 1960s. Every year in early July Copenhagen's streets, squares and parks fill up with big and small jazz concerts during the Copenhagen Jazz Festival (see yearly events).
The most important venue for rhythmical music in Copenhagen is Vega in [[Vesterbro, Copenhagen|Vesterbro]] district which has been chosen as &quot;best concert venue in Europe&quot; by international music magazine Live&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.visitcopenhagen.dk/presse/presseinformation/gaa_ud/vega_-_koncertsted_og_natklub|title=VEGA|publisher=Wonderfull Copenhagen|accessdate=2009-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For free [[entertainment]] one can stroll along [[Strøget]], especially between [[Nytorv]] and [[Højbro Plads]], which in the late afternoon and evening is a bit like an impromptu three-ring [[circus]] with [[musician]]s, [[magic (illusion)|magicians]], [[juggling|jugglers]] and other [[busking|street performers]].

===Sports===
Copenhagen has a wide variety of [[sport]] teams. The two major [[association football|football]] teams are [[Brøndby IF]] and [[F.C. Copenhagen|FC København]].

In 2011 Copenhagen will host the [[UCI Road World Championships]].

===Amusement parks===
[[File:TivoliChinese.jpg|thumb|right|Built in 1874 the [[Pantomimeteatret|Pantomime Theatre]] is the oldest building in the [[Tivoli Gardens]]]]

Copenhagen has the two oldest amusement parks in the World.&lt;ref name=&quot;www3&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aok.dk/byen-rundt/bakken|title=Dyrehavsbakken|publisher=AOK|accessdate=2009-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; World-famous [[Tivoli Gardens]] is an [[amusement park]] and [[pleasure garden]] located right in the middle of Copenhagen between [[The City Hall Square, Copenhagen|the City Hall Square]] and [[Copenhagen Central Station|the Central Station]]. Among its rides are the oldest still operating [[roller coaster]] and the oldest [[ferris wheel]] in the World.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.welcome-to-my-copenhagen.com/tivoli_gardens_copenhagen.html Tivoli Gardens, the rides]&lt;/ref&gt; It also functions as an [[open air concert|open-air concert]] venue. It opened on August 15, 1843 making it the second oldest amusement park in the world. [[Dyrehavsbakken]] (in English &quot;the Deer Garden Hill&quot;) is located in Klampenborg a little north of Copenhagen in a forested area known as [[Jægersborg Dyrehave|dyrehaven]]. Having been made into an amusement park complete with rides, games and restaurants by [[Christian IV of Denmark|Christian IV]], it is the oldest surviving amusement park in the World.&lt;ref name=&quot;www3&quot;/&gt;

===Cuisine===
As of 2009, Copenhagen has 13 [[Michelin Guide|Michelin star]] restaurants, the most of any Scandinavian city.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crystle.dk/?id=220695 ]{{Dead link|date=June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city is increasingly recognized internationally as a gourmet destination.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/travel/holiday_type/breaks/article5370597.ece The Top 10 cities to visit in 2009], TimesOnline&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from the selection of upmarket restaurants, Copenhagen offers a great variety of Danish, international and ethnic restaurants. It is possible to find modest eateries serving [[open sandwich]]es (&quot;[[smørrebrød]]&quot;) – the traditional and best known Danish lunch dish; however, most restaurants serve international dishes. Another local specialty, [[Danish pastry]], can be sampled from any of numerous bakeries found in all parts of the city. The restaurant [[Noma (restaurant)|Noma]] (Short for Danish: nordisk mad English: Nordic food) was ranked as the [[Restaurant (magazine) Top 50|Best Restaurant in the World]] by ''[[Restaurant (magazine)|Restaurant]]'' in 2010 and 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/foodanddrinknews/7635378/Noma-in-Copenhagen-named-best-restaurant-in-the-world.html Telegraph – Noma in Copenhagen named best restaurant in the world – April 26 2010].&lt;/ref&gt;

Copenhagen has long been associated with [[beer]]. [[Carlsberg Group|Carlsberg]] beer has been brewed at the brewery's premises at the border between [[Vesterbro, Copenhagen|Vesterbro]] and [[Valby]] districts since 1847 and has long been almost synonymous with [[Beer in Denmark|Danish beer]] production. However, recent years have seen an explosive growth in the number of [[microbrewery|microbreweries]] so that Denmark today has more than 100 breweries,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dev-bryggeriforeningen.dk/default.asp?pid=191&amp;show=12 Nyeste artikler fra Bryggeriforeningen], Bryggeriforeningen&lt;/ref&gt; many of which are located in Copenhagen. Some like ''Nørrebro Bryghus'' also act as [[brewpubs]] where it is also possible to eat at the premises.

===Media===
Many Danish media corroborations are located in Copenhagen. [[DR (broadcaster)|DR]], the major Danish [[public broadcasting|public service]] [[broadcasting]] corporation collected their activities in a new headquarters, [[DR Byen|DR byen]], in 2006 and 2007. Similarly has [[Odense]] based [[TV 2 (Denmark)|TV2]] collected its Copenhagen activities in a modern media house in the [[Teglholmen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.business.dk/article/20060515/nyhedsoversigt/105150198/|title=TV2 samles på Teglholmen|publisher=Berlingske Tidende|accessdate=2009-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two national daily newspapers [[Politiken]] and [[Berlingske Tidende]] and the two [[tabloid]]s [[Ekstra Bladet]] and [[B.T. (tabloid)|B.T.]] are based in Copenhagen. Other important media corporations include [[Aller Media]] which is the largest publisher of weekly and monthly magazines in [[Scandinavia]], the [[Egmont Publishing|Egmont]] [[media conglomerate|media group]] and [[Gyldendal]], the largest Danish publisher of books.

'''Tickets'''. The Copenhagen local traffic area is divided in 95 zones. Zones 1,2 and 3 are equal to Copenhagen inner city.
Ticket machines exist on all stations, and tickets can also be bought at buses and manually at the major stations. A ticket price inside the Copenhagen local traffic area is always ''between two and nine zones'' (a nine zone ticket goes for all zones). Price is currently (2010) 11.50 DKK for each zone.
There are a number of fare discount systems, for instance 24 hour travel card.

The main junction stations for interchange between system or lines are the stations of Nørreport, Valby, Danshøj, Kastrup Airport, Ny Ellebjerg, Hellerup, Østerport, Ryparken, Ørestaden, Flintholm, and København H ([[Copenhagen Central Station]]). The latter is also a hub for trains with destinations outside the Copenhagen local traffic area.

'''Danish and international trains'''

[[Copenhagen Central Station]] provides Copenhagen with Intercity and Express trains across Denmark, as well as services to several international destinations. The train traffic to [[Hamburg]] is especially heavy, and other distant destinations can also be reached by daily international trains. Trains to southern and western Sweden depart every 20 minutes. (A special ticket fare system exists between the Copenhagen local traffic area and the most southern part of Sweden, Skåne county.)

==Environment==
Copenhagen is recognized as one of the most environmentally friendly cities in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://grist.org/news/maindish/2007/07/19/cities/|title=15 green cities|publisher=grist|accessdate=2009-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the city's success can be attributed to a strong municipal policy combined with a sound national policy, in 1971 Denmark established a Ministry of Environment and the first country in the world to implement an [[environmental law]] in 1973. In 2006 Copenhagen Municipality received the ''European Environmental Management Award''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dhigroup.com/News/NewsArchive/2006/CopenhagenReceivesEuropeanEnvironmentalAward.aspx|title=Copenhagen Receives European Environmental Award|publisher=grist|accessdate=2009-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The award was given for long-term holistic [[environmental planning]]. It is municipal policy to reduce [[global warming|CO2 emissions]] by 20% before the end of 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kk.dk/vejpark.aspx|title=street lights in Copenhagen|publisher=Københavns Kommune|accessdate=2009-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001 a large offshore [[wind farm]] was built just off the coast of Copenhagen at [[Middelgrunden]]. It produces about 4% of the city's energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cece.dk/EE0911AA-D9A1-49E8-9CA2-332E37BBA568|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070706184255/http://www.cece.dk/EE0911AA-D9A1-49E8-9CA2-332E37BBA568|archivedate=2007-07-06|title=Environmental Capital of Europe|publisher=Copenhagen, Environmental Capital of Europe|accessdate=2009-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many years of major investments in [[sewage treatment]] has improved [[water quality]] in the harbour to an extent that the inner harbour can be used for swimming and facilities for this are provided at a number of locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sustainablecities.dk/city-projects/cases/copenhagen-from-sewer-to-harbour-bath|title=Copenhagen: From sewer to harbour bath|publisher=Sustainable Cities|accessdate=2009-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another municipal policy is that 40% of all citizens should bicycle to and from work by 2012 and a number of initiatives are being taken to implement this policy (see &quot;bicycling&quot; above).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vejsektoren.dk/wimpnews.asp?page=document&amp;objno=132538|title=Bicycle transport|publisher=Københavns Kommune|accessdate=2009-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Copenhagen is the capital in the world where [[organic food]] has the largest [[market share]]. One in every ten purchases is organic in Copenhagen.&lt;ref name=&quot;copcap1&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.copcap.com/content/us/quick_links/news/latest_news/news_archive_from_old_site/copenhagen_world_champion_in_organic_foods|title=World-champinions in organic food|publisher=Copenhagen Capacity|accessdate=2009-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the municipal sector in Copenhagen, 45% of all food consumption is organic but the target is considerably higher. With the environmental strategy &quot;Environment Metropolis: Our Vision 2015&quot; the politicians wish that solely organic food is to be served in 90 per cent of the Copenhagen old-age homes and residential homes for children and young persons in 2015.&lt;ref name=&quot;copcap1&quot;/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Combinatorics''' is a branch of [[mathematics]] concerning the study of finite or [[Countable set|countable]] [[discrete mathematics|discrete]] [[Mathematical structure|structures]]. Aspects of combinatorics include counting the structures of a given kind and size (''[[enumerative combinatorics]]''), deciding when certain criteria can be met, and constructing and analyzing objects meeting the criteria (as in ''[[combinatorial design|combinatorial designs]] and [[matroid]] theory''), finding &quot;largest&quot;, &quot;smallest&quot;, or &quot;optimal&quot; objects (''[[extremal combinatorics]]'' and ''[[combinatorial optimization]]''), and studying combinatorial structures arising in an [[algebra]]ic context, or applying algebraic techniques to combinatorial problems (''[[algebraic combinatorics]]'').  

Combinatorial problems arise in many areas of pure mathematics, notably in [[algebra]], [[probability theory]], [[topology]], and [[geometry]],&lt;ref&gt;Björner and Stanley, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; and combinatorics also has many applications in [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]], [[computer science]], [[ergodic theory]] and [[statistical physics]]. Many combinatorial questions have historically been considered in isolation, giving an ''ad hoc'' solution to a problem arising in some mathematical context. In the later twentieth century however powerful and general theoretical methods were developed, making combinatorics into an independent branch of mathematics in its own right. One of the oldest and most accessible parts of combinatorics is [[graph theory]], which also has numerous natural connections to other areas.  Combinatorics is used frequently in [[computer science]] to obtain formulas and estimates in the [[analysis of algorithms]].  

A [[mathematician]] who studies combinatorics is called a ''combinatorialist''.

{{main|History of combinatorics}}

Basic combinatorial concepts and enumerative results have appeared throughout the [[Ancient history|ancient world]]. In 6th century BC,  [[physician]] [[Sushruta]] asserts in [[Sushruta Samhita]] that 63 combinations can be made out of 6 different tastes, taken one at a time, two at a time, etc., thus computing all 2&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-1 possibilities.  [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[historian]] [[Plutarch]] discusses an argument between [[Chrysippus]] (3rd century BC) and [[Hipparchus]] (2nd century BC) of a rather delicate enumerative problem, which was later shown to be related to [[Schröder number|Schröder numbers]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard P. Stanley|R.P. Stanley]], &quot;Hipparchus, Plutarch, Schröder, and Hough&quot;, 
''Amer. Math. Monthly'' '''104''' (1997), no. 4, 344-350.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;L. Habsieger, M. Kazarian, S. Lando, On the second number of Plutarch, 
''Amer. Math. Monthly'' '''105''' (1998), no. 5, 446.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the ''[[Ostomachion]]'',  [[Archimedes]] (3rd century BC)
considers a [[tiling puzzle]]. 

In the [[Middle Ages]], combinatorics continued to be studied, largely outside of the [[European civilization]].  Notably, an [[India]]n mathematician [[Mahavira (mathematician)|Mahavira]] (c. 850) provided the general formulae for the number of permutations and combinations.  The [[philosopher]] and [[astronomer]] Rabbi [[Abraham ibn Ezra]] (c. 1140) established the symmetry of [[binomial coefficient|binomial coefficients]], while a closed formula was obtained later by the [[talmudist]] and [[mathematician]] [[Levi ben Gerson]] (better known as Gersonides), in 1321.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ncertbooks.prashanthellina.com/class_11.Mathematics.Mathematics/Ch-07(Permutation%20and%20Combinations%20FINAL%20%2004.01.06).pdf History of Combinatorics], chapter in a textbook.&lt;/ref&gt;
The arithmetical triangle— a graphical diagram showing relationships among the binomial coefficients— was presented by mathematicians in treatises dating as far back as the 10th century, and would eventually become known as [[Pascal's triangle]]. Later, in [[Medieval England]], [[campanology]] provided examples of what is now known as [[Hamiltonian cycle|Hamiltonian cycles]] in certain [[Cayley graph|Cayley graphs]] on permutations.&lt;ref&gt;
Arthur T. White, ”Ringing the Cosets,” ''Amer. Math. Monthly'' '''94''' (1987), no. 8, 721-746; Arthur T. White, ”Fabian Stedman: The First Group Theorist?,” ''Amer. Math. Monthly'' '''103''' (1996), no. 9, 771-778.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Renaissance]], together with the rest of mathematics and the [[science|sciences]], combinatorics enjoyed a rebirth.  Works of [[Blaise Pascal|Pascal]], [[Isaac Newton|Newton]], [[Jacob Bernoulli]] and [[Leonard Euler|Euler]] became foundational in the emerging field.  In the modern times, the works by [[James Joseph Sylvester|J. J. Sylvester]] (late 19th century) and [[Percy Alexander MacMahon|Percy MacMahon]] (early 20th century) laid the foundation for [[Enumerative combinatorics|enumerative]] and [[algebraic combinatorics]].  [[Graph theory]] also enjoyed an explosion of interest at the same time, especially in connection with the [[four color problem]].

In the second half of 20th century, combinatorics enjoyed a rapid growth, which led to establishment of dozens of new journals and conferences in the subject.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.combinatorics.net/journals/ Journals in Combinatorics and Related Fields] and [http://www.combinatorics.net/conf/ Conferences on Combinatorics]&lt;/ref&gt; In part, the growth was spurred by new connections and applications to other fields, ranging from algebra to probability, from functional analysis to number theory, etc.  These connections shed the boundaries between combinatorics and parts of mathematics and theoretical computer science, but at the same time led to a partial fragmentation of the field.

[[Image:Catalan number binary tree example.png|320px|right|thumb|Five [[binary tree|binary trees]] on three [[Vertex (graph theory)|vertices]], an example of [[Catalan number|Catalan numbers]].]]

{{main|Enumerative combinatorics}}

'''Enumerative combinatorics''' is the most classical area of combinatorics, and concentrates on counting the number of certain combinatorial objects.  Although counting the number of elements in a set is a rather broad [[mathematical problem]], many of the problems that arise in applications have a relatively simple combinatorial description. [[Fibonacci numbers]] is the basic example of a problem in enumerative combinatorics.  The [[twelvefold way]] provides a unified framework for counting [[permutations]], [[combinations]] and [[Partition of a set|partitions]].

==Analytic combinatorics==
{{main|Analytic combinatorics}}

'''Analytic combinatorics''' concerns the enumeration of combinatorial structures using tools from [[complex analysis]] and [[probability theory]].  In contrast with enumerative combinatorics which uses explicit combinatorial formulae and [[generating functions]] to describe the results, analytic combinatorics aims at obtaining [[Asymptotic analysis|asymptotic formulae]].

== Partition theory ==
[[Image:Partition3D.svg|150px|right|thumb|A [[plane partition]].]]

{{main|Partition (number theory)|l1=Partition theory}}

'''Partition theory''' studies various enumeration and asymptotic problems related to [[integer partition|integer partitions]], and is closely related to [[q-series]], [[special functions]] and [[orthogonal polynomials]].  Originally a part of [[number theory]] and [[analysis]], it is now considered a part of combinatorics or an independent field.  It incorporates the [[Bijective proof|bijective approach]] and various tools in analysis, [[analytic number theory]], and has connections with [[statistical mechanics]].

==Graph theory==
[[Image:Petersen1 tiny.svg|thumb|150px|[[Petersen graph]].]]
{{main|Graph theory}}

'''Graphs''' are basic objects in combinatorics.  The questions range from counting (e.g., the number of graphs on ''n'' vertices with ''k'' edges) to structural (e.g., which graphs contain Hamiltonian cycles) to algebraic questions (e.g., given a graph G and two numbers x and y, does the [[Tutte polynomial]] T&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;(x,y) have a combinatorial interpretation?).  It should be noted that while there are very strong connections between graph theory and combinatorics, these two are sometimes thought of as separate subjects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.math.gatech.edu/~sanders/graphtheory/writings/2-digit.html 2-Digit MSC Comparison], by Daniel P. Sanders.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design theory==
{{main|Combinatorial design}}

'''Design theory''' is a study of [[combinatorial design|combinatorial designs]], which are collections of subsets with certain [[Set intersection|intersection]] properties. [[Block design|Block designs]] are combinatorial designs of a special type. This area is one of the oldest parts of combinatorics, such as in [[Kirkman's schoolgirl problem]] proposed in 1850. The solution of the problem is a special case of a [[Steiner system]], which systems play an important role in the [[classification of finite simple groups]]. The area has further connections to coding theory and geometric combinatorics.

== Order theory ==
[[Image:Hasse diagram of powerset of 3.svg|thumb|right|150px|[[Hasse diagram]] of the [[Power set|powerset]] of {x,y,z} ordered by [[Inclusion map|inclusion]].]]

{{main|Order theory}}

'''Order theory''' is the study of [[partially ordered sets]], both finite and infinite.  Various examples of partial orders appear in [[abstract algebra|algebra]], geometry, number theory and throughout combinatorics and graph theory.  Notable classes and examples of partial orders include [[Lattice (order)|lattices]] and [[Boolean algebras]].

==Matroid theory==
{{main|Matroid theory}}
'''Matroid theory''' abstracts part of [[geometry]].   It studies the properties of sets (usually, finite sets) of vectors in a [[vector space]] that do not depend on the particular coefficients in a [[linear independence|linear dependence]] relation.  Not only the structure but also enumerative properties belong to matroid theory.  Matroid theory was introduced by [[Hassler Whitney]] and studied as a part of the order theory.  It is now an independent field of study with a number of connections with other parts of combinatorics.

==Extremal combinatorics==
{{main|Extremal combinatorics}}

'''Extremal combinatorics''' studies extremal questions on [[set system|set systems]]. The types of questions addressed in this case are about the largest possible graph which satisfies certain properties.  For example, the largest triangle-free graph on ''2n'' vertices is a [[complete bipartite graph]] ''K&lt;sub&gt;n,n&lt;/sub&gt;''. Often it is too hard even to find the extremal answer ''f''(''n'') exactly and one can only give an [[asymptotic analysis|asymptotic estimate]]. 

[[Ramsey theory]] is another part of extremal combinatorics.  It states that any [[sufficiently large]] configuration will contain some sort of order. It is an advanced generalization of the [[pigeonhole principle]].

==Probabilistic combinatorics==
[[Image:Self avoiding walk.svg|thumb|right|150px|[[Self-avoiding walk]] in a [[Lattice graph|square grid graph]].]]

{{main|Probabilistic method}}

In '''probabilistic combinatorics''', the questions are of the following type: what is the probability of a certain property for a random discrete object, such as a [[random graph]]?. For instance, what is the average number of triangles in a random graph?  Probabilistic methods are also used to determine the existence of combinatorial objects with certain prescribed properties (for which explicit examples might be difficult to find), simply by observing that the probability of randomly selecting an object with those properties is greater than 0. This approach (often referred to as ''the'' [[probabilistic method]]) proved highly effective in applications to extremal combinatorics and graph theory.  A closely related area is the study of finite [[Markov chains]], especially on combinatorial objects.  Here again probabilistic tools are used to estimate the [[Markov chain mixing time|mixing time]].  

Often associated with [[Paul Erdős]], who did the pioneer work on the subject, probabilistic combinatorics was traditionally viewed as a set of tools to study problems in other parts of combinatorics.  However, with the growth of applications to [[analysis of algorithms]] in [[computer science]], as well as classical probability, [[Additive number theory|additive]] and [[probabilistic number theory]], the area recently grew to become an independent field of combinatorics.

==Algebraic combinatorics==
[[Image:Young diagram for 541 partition.svg|thumb|right|150px|[[Young diagram]] of a [[Partition (number theory)|partition]] (5,4,1).]]
{{main|Algebraic combinatorics}}

'''Algebraic combinatorics''' is an area of [[mathematics]] that employs methods of [[abstract algebra]], notably [[group theory]] and [[representation theory]], in various combinatorial contexts and, conversely, applies combinatorial techniques to problems in [[abstract algebra|algebra]]. Within the last decade or so, algebraic combinatorics came to be seen more expansively as the area of mathematics where the interaction of combinatorial and algebraic methods is particularly strong and significant. One of the fastest developing subfields within algebraic combinatorics is [[combinatorial commutative algebra]].

==Combinatorics on words==
[[Image:Morse-Thue sequence.gif|thumb|right|210px|Construction of a [[Thue-Morse sequence|Thue-Morse infinite word]].]]

{{main|Combinatorics on words}}

'''Combinatorics on words''' is an area of combinatorics which studies [[formal language|formal languages]].  It  arose independently within several branches of mathematics, including [[number theory]], [[group theory]] and [[probability]]. It has applications to enumerative combinatorics, [[fractal analysis]], [[theoretical computer science]], [[automata theory]] and [[linguistics]].  While many applications are new, the classical [[Chomsky–Schützenberger hierarchy]] of classes of [[formal grammar|formal grammars]] is perhaps the best known result in the field.

==Geometric combinatorics==
[[Image:Icosahedron.svg||150px|thumb|right|An [[icosahedron]].]]

{{main|Geometric combinatorics}}

'''Geometric combinatorics''' is related to [[Convex geometry|convex]] and [[discrete geometry]], in particular [[polyhedral combinatorics]].  It asks, for example, how many faces of each dimension can a [[convex polytope]] have.  [[Metric geometry|Metric]] properties of polytopes play an important role as well, e.g. the   [[Cauchy's theorem (geometry)|Cauchy theorem]] on rigidity of convex polytopes.  Special polytopes are also considered, such as [[permutohedron|permutohedra]], [[associahedron|associahedra]] and [[Birkhoff polytope|Birkhoff polytopes]].  We should note that [[combinatorial geometry]] is an old fashioned name for discrete geometry.

==Topological combinatorics==
[[Image:Necklace cropped.png||150px|thumb|right|[[Necklace splitting problem|Splitting a necklace]] with two cuts.]]
{{main|Topological combinatorics}}

Combinatorial analogs of concepts and methods in [[topology]] are used to study [[graph coloring]], [[fair division]], [[partition of a set|partitions]], [[partially ordered set|partially ordered sets]], [[decision tree|decision trees]], [[necklace problem|necklace problems]] and [[discrete Morse theory]].  It should not be confused with [[combinatorial topology]] which is an older name for [[algebraic topology]].

==Arithmetic combinatorics==
{{main|Arithmetic combinatorics}}

'''Arithmetic combinatorics''' arose out of the interplay between [[number theory]], combinatorics, [[ergodic theory]] and [[harmonic analysis]]. It is about combinatorial estimates associated with arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). ''Additive combinatorics'' refers to the special case when only the operations of addition and subtraction are involved.  One important technique in arithmetic combinatorics is the [[ergodic theory]] of [[dynamical system|dynamical systems]].

==Infinitary combinatorics==
{{main|Infinitary combinatorics}}

'''Infinitary combinatorics''', or combinatorial set theory, is an extension of ideas in combinatorics to infinite sets.  It is a part of [[set theory]], an area of [[mathematical logic]], but uses tools and ideas from both set theory and extremal combinatorics. 

[[Gian-Carlo Rota]] used the name ''continuous combinatorics''&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.uml.edu/dklain/cpc.pdf Continuous and profinite combinatorics]&lt;/ref&gt; to describe [[probability]] and [[measure theory]], since there are many analogies between ''counting'' and ''measure''.

== Related fields ==
[[Image:Kissing-3d.png|150px|right|thumb|[[kissing number|Kissing spheres]] are connected to both [[coding theory]] and [[discrete geometry]].]]

=== Combinatorial optimization ===
[[Combinatorial optimization]] is the study of optimization on discrete and combinatorial objects. It started as a part of combinatorics and graph theory, but is now viewed as a branch of applied mathematics and computer science, related to [[operations research]], [[Analysis of algorithms|algorithm theory]] and [[computational complexity theory]].

=== Coding theory ===
[[Coding theory]] started as a part of design theory with early combinatorial constructions of [[error-correcting code|error-correcting codes]]. The main idea of the subject is to design efficient and reliable methods of data transmission. It is now a large field of study, part of [[information theory]].

=== Discrete and computational geometry ===
[[Discrete geometry]] (also called combinatorial geometry) also began a part of combinatorics, with early results on [[convex polytope|convex polytopes]] and [[kissing number|kissing numbers]].  With the emergence of applications of discrete geometry to [[computational geometry]], these two fields partially merged and became a separate field of study.  There remain many connections with geometric and topological combinatorics, which themselves can be viewed as outgrowths of the early discrete geometry.

===Combinatorics and dynamical systems===
[[Combinatorics and dynamical systems|Combinatorial aspects of dynamical systems]] is another emerging field.  Here dynamical systems can be defined on combinatorial objects.  See for example 
[[graph dynamical system]].

===Combinatorics and physics===
There are increasing interactions between [[combinatorics and physics]], particularly [[statistical physics]]. Examples include an exact solution of the [[Ising model]], and a connection between the [[Potts model]] on one hand, and the [[chromatic polynomial|chromatic]] and [[Tutte polynomial|Tutte polynomials]] on the other hand.

{{Calculus}}
'''Calculus''' ([[Latin]], ''[[wikt:en:calculus#Latin|calculus]]'', a small stone used for counting) is a branch of [[mathematics]] focused on [[limit (mathematics)|limits]], [[function (mathematics)|functions]], [[derivative]]s, [[integral]]s, and [[infinite series]]. This subject constitutes a major part of modern [[mathematics education]]. It has two major branches, '''[[differential calculus]]''' and '''[[integral calculus]]''', which are related by the [[fundamental theorem of calculus]]. Calculus is the study of change,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

&lt;/ref&gt; in the same way that [[geometry]] is the study of shape and [[algebra]] is the study of operations and their application to solving equations. A course in calculus is a gateway to other, more advanced courses in mathematics devoted to the study of functions and limits, broadly called [[mathematical analysis]]. Calculus has widespread applications in [[science]], [[economics]], and [[engineering]] and can solve many problems for which [[Elementary algebra|algebra]] alone is insufficient.

Historically, calculus was called &quot;the calculus of [[infinitesimal]]s&quot;, or &quot;[[infinitesimal calculus]]&quot;. More generally, ''calculus'' (plural ''calculi'') refers to any method or system of calculation guided by the symbolic manipulation of expressions. Some examples of other well-known calculi are [[propositional calculus]], [[variational calculus]], [[lambda calculus]], [[pi calculus]], and [[join calculus]].

{{Main|History of calculus}}

=== Ancient ===
[[File:GodfreyKneller-IsaacNewton-1689.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Isaac Newton]] developed the use of calculus in his [[Newton's laws of motion|laws of motion]] and [[gravitation]].]]

The ancient period introduced some of the ideas that led to [[integral]] calculus, but does not seem to have developed these ideas in a rigorous or systematic way.  Calculations of volumes and areas, one goal of integral calculus, can be found in the [[Egyptian mathematics|Egyptian]] [[Moscow Mathematical Papyrus|Moscow papyrus]] (c. 1820 BC), but the formulas are mere instructions, with no indication as to method, and some of them are wrong.  Some, including [[Morris Kline]] in ''Mathematical thought from ancient to modern times'', Vol. I, suggest trial and error.&lt;ref&gt;Morris Kline, ''Mathematical thought from ancient to modern times'', Vol. I&lt;/ref&gt;  From the age of [[Greek mathematics]], [[Eudoxus of Cnidus|Eudoxus]] (c. 408−355 BC) used the [[method of exhaustion]], which prefigures the concept of the limit, to calculate areas and volumes, while [[Archimedes]] (c. 287−212 BC) [[Archimedes' use of infinitesimals|developed this idea further]], inventing [[heuristics]] which resemble the methods of integral calculus.&lt;ref&gt;Archimedes, ''Method'', in ''The Works of Archimedes'' ISBN 978-0-521-66160-7&lt;/ref&gt; The [[method of exhaustion]] was later reinvented in [[Chinese mathematics|China]] by [[Liu Hui]] in the 3rd century AD in order to find the area of a circle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Medieval ===
In the 14th Century Indian mathematician [[Madhava of Sangamagrama]] stated many components of calculus such as the [[Taylor series]], [[infinite series]] approximations, early forms of differentiation, term by term integration, iterative methods for solutions of non-linear equations, and the theory that the area under a curve is its integral. Some consider the [[Yuktibhāṣā]] to be the first text on calculus.&lt;ref&gt;http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/HistTopics/Indian_mathematics.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modern ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2009}}

In Europe, the foundational work was a treatise due to [[Bonaventura Cavalieri]], who argued that volumes and areas should be computed as the sums of the volumes and areas of infinitesimal thin cross-sections. The ideas were similar to Archimedes' in [[Archimedes' use of infinitesimals|The Method]], but this treatise was lost until the early part of the twentieth century. Cavalieri's work was not well respected since his methods could lead to erroneous results, and the infinitesimal quantities he introduced were disreputable at first.

The formal study of calculus combined Cavalieri's infinitesimals with the [[calculus of finite differences]] developed in Europe at around the same time. Pierre de Fermat, claiming that he borrowed from [[Diophantus]], introduced the concept of [[adequality]], which represented equality up to an infinitesimal error term.&lt;ref&gt;[[André Weil]]: Number theory. An approach through history. From Hammurapi to Legendre. Birkhauser Boston, Inc., Boston, MA, 1984, ISBN 0817645659, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;  The combination was achieved by [[John Wallis]], [[Isaac Barrow]], and [[James Gregory (astronomer and mathematician)|James Gregory]], the latter two proving the [[Fundamental theorem of calculus|second fundamental theorem of calculus]] around 1675.

The [[product rule]] and [[chain rule]], the notion of [[higher derivative]]s, [[Taylor series]], and [[analytical function]]s were introduced by [[Isaac Newton]] in an idiosyncratic notation which he used to solve problems of [[mathematical physics]]. In his publications, Newton rephrased his ideas to suit the mathematical idiom of the time, replacing calculations with infinitesimals by equivalent geometrical arguments which were considered beyond reproach. He used the methods of calculus to solve the problem of planetary motion, the shape of the surface of a rotating fluid, the oblateness of the earth, the motion of a weight sliding on a [[cycloid]], and many other problems discussed in his ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia Mathematica]]'' (1687). In other work, he developed series expansions for functions, including fractional and irrational powers, and it was clear that he understood the principles of the [[Taylor series]]. He did not publish all these discoveries, and at this time infinitesimal methods were still considered disreputable.

[[File:Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz.jpg|thumb|200px|left|''[[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]]'' was the first to publish his results on the development of calculus.]]

These ideas were systematized into a true calculus of infinitesimals by [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]], who was originally accused of [[plagiarism]] by Newton.&lt;ref&gt;Leibniz, Gottfried Wilhelm. The Early Mathematical Manuscripts of Leibniz. Cosimo, Inc., 2008.  Page 228. [http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=7d8_4WPc9SMC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=Gottfried+Wilhelm+Leibniz+accused+of+plagiarism+by+Newton&amp;ots=09h9BdTlbE&amp;sig=hu5tNKpBJxHcpj8U3kR_T2bZqrY#v=onepage&amp;q=plagairism&amp;f=false|Online Copy]&lt;/ref&gt; He is now regarded as an independent inventor of and contributor to calculus. His contribution was to provide a clear set of rules for manipulating infinitesimal quantities, allowing the computation of second and higher derivatives, and providing the [[product rule]] and [[chain rule]], in their differential and integral forms. Unlike Newton, Leibniz paid a lot of attention to the formalism, often spending days determining appropriate symbols for concepts.

[[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]] and [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] are usually both credited with the invention of calculus. Newton was the first to apply calculus to general [[physics]] and Leibniz developed much of the notation used in calculus today. The basic insights that both Newton and Leibniz provided were the laws of differentiation and integration, second and higher derivatives, and the notion of an approximating polynomial series. By Newton's time, the fundamental theorem of calculus was known.

When Newton and Leibniz first published their results, there was [[Newton v. Leibniz calculus controversy|great controversy]] over which mathematician (and therefore which country) deserved credit. Newton derived his results first, but Leibniz published first. Newton claimed Leibniz stole ideas from his unpublished notes, which Newton had shared with a few members of the [[Royal Society]]. This controversy divided English-speaking mathematicians from continental mathematicians for many years, to the detriment of English mathematics. A careful examination of the papers of Leibniz and Newton shows that they arrived at their results independently, with Leibniz starting first with integration and Newton with differentiation. Today, both Newton and Leibniz are given credit for developing calculus independently. It is Leibniz, however, who gave the new discipline its name. Newton called his calculus &quot;[[Method of fluxions|the science of fluxions]]&quot;.

Since the time of Leibniz and Newton, many mathematicians have contributed to the continuing development of calculus. One of the first and most complete works on finite and infinitesimal analysis was written in 1748 by [[Maria Gaetana Agnesi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.agnesscott.edu/lriddle/women/agnesi.htm| title=Maria Gaetana Agnesi| first=Elif| last=Unlu| month=April| year=1995| publisher   =Agnes Scott College}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Foundations ===
In mathematics, ''foundations'' refers to the [[Rigorous#Mathematical rigour|rigorous]] development of a subject from precise axioms and definitions.  In early calculus the use of [[infinitesimal]] quantities was thought unrigorous, and was fiercely criticized by a number of authors, most notably [[Michel Rolle]] and [[George Berkeley|Bishop Berkeley]]. Berkeley famously described infinitesimals as the [[ghosts of departed quantities]] in his book ''[[The Analyst]]'' in 1734. Working out a rigorous foundation for calculus occupied mathematicians for much of the century following Newton and Leibniz and is still to some extent an active area of research today.

Several mathematicians, including [[Colin Maclaurin|Maclaurin]], attempted to prove the soundness of using infinitesimals, but it would be 150 years later, due to the work of [[Augustin Louis Cauchy|Cauchy]] and [[Karl Weierstrass|Weierstrass]], where a means was finally found to avoid mere &quot;notions&quot; of infinitely small quantities and the foundations of differential and integral calculus were made firm. In Cauchy's writing, we find a versatile spectrum of foundational approaches, including a definition of [[continuous function|continuity]] in terms of infinitesimals, and a (somewhat imprecise) prototype of an [[(ε, δ)-definition of limit]] in the definition of differentiation. In his work Weierstrass formalized the concept of [[Limit of a function|limit]]&lt;!--correct link?--&gt; and eliminated infinitesimals. Following the work of Weierstrass, it eventually became common to base calculus on limits instead of infinitesimal quantities. [[Bernhard Riemann]] used these ideas to give a precise definition of the integral. It was also during this period that the ideas of calculus were generalized to [[Euclidean space]] and the [[complex plane]].

In modern mathematics, the foundations of calculus are included in the field of [[real analysis]], which contains full definitions and [[mathematical proof|proof]]s of the theorems of calculus.  The reach of calculus has also been greatly extended. [[Henri Lebesgue]] invented [[measure theory]] and used it to define integrals of all but the most pathological functions.  [[Laurent Schwartz]] introduced [[Distribution (mathematics)|Distribution]]s, which can be used to take the derivative of any function whatsoever.

Limits are not the only rigorous approach to the foundation of calculus. An alternative is [[Abraham Robinson]]'s [[nonstandard analysis]]. Robinson's approach, developed in the 1960s, uses technical machinery from [[mathematical logic]] to augment the real number system with [[infinitesimal]] and [[infinite]] numbers, as in the original Newton-Leibniz conception. The resulting numbers are called [[hyperreal number]]s, and they can be used to give a  Leibniz-like development of the usual rules of calculus.

=== Significance ===

While some of the ideas of calculus were developed earlier in [[Egyptian mathematics|Egypt]], [[Greek mathematics|Greece]], [[Chinese mathematics|China]], [[Indian mathematics|India]], [[Islamic mathematics|Iraq, Persia]], and [[Japanese mathematics|Japan]], the modern use of calculus began in [[Europe]], during the 17th century, when [[Isaac Newton]] and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] built on the work of earlier mathematicians to introduce its basic principles. The development of calculus was built on earlier concepts of instantaneous motion and area underneath curves.

Applications of differential calculus include computations involving [[velocity]] and [[acceleration]], the [[slope]] of a curve, and [[Mathematical optimization|optimization]]. Applications of integral calculus include computations involving [[area]], [[volume]], [[arc length]], [[center of mass]], [[work (physics)|work]], and [[pressure]]. More advanced applications include [[power series]] and [[Fourier series]]. Calculus can be used to compute the trajectory of a shuttle docking at a space station or the amount of snow in a driveway.

Calculus is also used to gain a more precise understanding of the nature of space, time, and motion. For centuries, mathematicians and philosophers wrestled with paradoxes involving [[division by zero]] or sums of infinitely many numbers. These questions arise in the study of [[Motion (physics)|motion]] and [[area]]. The [[ancient Greek]] [[philosopher]] [[Zeno of Elea|Zeno]] gave several famous examples of such [[Zeno's paradoxes|paradoxes]]. Calculus provides tools, especially the [[Limit (mathematics)|limit]] and the [[infinite series]], which resolve the paradoxes.

== Principles ==
=== Limits and infinitesimals ===
{{Main|Limit of a function|Infinitesimal|Infinitesimal Calculus}}
Calculus is usually developed by manipulating very small quantities. Historically, the first method of doing so was by [[infinitesimal]]s. These are objects which can be treated like numbers but which are, in some sense, &quot;infinitely small&quot;. An infinitesimal number ''dx'' could be greater than 0, but less than any number in the sequence 1, 1/2, 1/3, ... and less than any positive [[real number]]. Any integer multiple of an infinitesimal is still infinitely small, i.e., infinitesimals do not satisfy the [[Archimedean property]]. From this point of view, calculus is a collection of techniques for manipulating infinitesimals. This approach fell out of favor in the 19th century because it was difficult to make the notion of an infinitesimal precise. However, the concept was revived in the 20th century with the introduction of [[non-standard analysis]] and [[smooth infinitesimal analysis]], which provided solid foundations for the manipulation of infinitesimals.

In the 19th century, infinitesimals were replaced by [[Limit of a function|limit]]s. Limits describe the value of a [[function (mathematics)|function]] at a certain input in terms of its values at nearby input. They capture small-scale behavior, just like infinitesimals, but use the ordinary [[real number|real number system]]. In this treatment, calculus is a collection of techniques for manipulating certain limits. Infinitesimals get replaced by very small numbers, and the infinitely small behavior of the function is found by taking the limiting behavior for smaller and smaller numbers. Limits are the easiest way to provide rigorous foundations for calculus, and for this reason they are the standard approach.

=== Differential calculus ===
{{Main|Differential calculus}}
[[File:Tangent derivative calculusdia.svg|thumb|300px|Tangent line at (''x'', ''f''(''x'')). The derivative ''f′''(''x'') of a curve at a point is the slope (rise over run) of the line tangent to that curve at that point.]]

Differential calculus is the study of the definition, properties, and applications of the [[derivative]] of a function. The process of finding the derivative is called ''differentiation''. Given a function and a point in the domain, the derivative at that point is a way of encoding the small-scale behavior of the function near that point. By finding the derivative of a function at every point in its domain, it is possible to produce a new function, called the ''derivative function'' or just the ''derivative'' of the original function. In mathematical jargon, the derivative is a [[linear operator]] which inputs a function and outputs a second function. This is more abstract than many of the processes studied in elementary algebra, where functions usually input a number and output another number. For example, if the doubling function is given the input three, then it outputs six, and if the squaring function is given the input three, then it outputs nine. The derivative, however, can take the squaring function as an input. This means that the derivative takes all the information of the squaring function—such as that two is sent to four, three is sent to nine, four is sent to sixteen, and so on—and uses this information to produce another function. (The function it produces turns out to be the doubling function.)

The most common symbol for a derivative is an apostrophe-like mark called [[prime (symbol)|prime]]. Thus, the derivative of the function of ''f'' is ''f′'', pronounced &quot;f prime.&quot; For instance, if ''f''(''x'') = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is the squaring function, then ''f′''(''x'') = 2''x'' is its derivative, the doubling function.

If the input of the function represents time, then the derivative represents change with respect to time. For example, if ''f'' is a function that takes a time as input and gives the position of a ball at that time as output, then the derivative of ''f'' is how the position is changing in time, that is, it is the [[velocity]] of the ball.

If a function is [[linear function|linear]] (that is, if the [[Graph of a function|graph]] of the function is a straight line), then the function can be written as {{nowrap|''y'' {{=}} ''mx'' + ''b''}}, where ''x'' is the independent variable, ''y'' is the dependent variable, ''b'' is the ''y''-intercept, and:

:&lt;math&gt;m= \frac{\text{rise}}{\text{run}}= \frac{\text{change in } y}{\text{change in } x} = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}.&lt;/math&gt;

This gives an exact value for the slope of a straight line. If the graph of the function is not a straight line, however, then the change in ''y'' divided by the change in ''x'' varies. Derivatives give an exact meaning to the notion of change in output with respect to change in input. To be concrete, let ''f'' be a function, and fix a point ''a'' in the domain of ''f''. (''a'', ''f''(''a'')) is a point on the graph of the function. If ''h'' is a number close to zero, then ''a'' + ''h'' is a number close to ''a''. Therefore (''a'' + ''h'', ''f''(''a'' + ''h'')) is close to (''a'', ''f''(''a'')). The slope between these two points is

:&lt;math&gt;m = \frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{(a+h) - a} = \frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h}.&lt;/math&gt;

This expression is called a ''difference quotient''. A line through two points on a curve is called a ''secant line'', so ''m'' is the slope of the secant line between (''a'', ''f''(''a'')) and (''a'' + ''h'', ''f''(''a'' + ''h'')). The secant line is only an approximation to the behavior of the function at the point ''a'' because it does not account for what happens between ''a'' and ''a'' + ''h''. It is not possible to discover the behavior at ''a'' by setting ''h'' to zero because this would require dividing by zero, which is impossible. The derivative is defined by taking the [[limit (mathematics)|limit]] as ''h'' tends to zero, meaning that it considers the behavior of ''f'' for all small values of ''h'' and extracts a consistent value for the case when ''h'' equals zero:

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{h \to 0}{f(a+h) - f(a)\over{h}}.&lt;/math&gt;

Geometrically, the derivative is the slope of the [[tangent line]] to the graph of ''f'' at ''a''. The tangent line is a limit of secant lines just as the derivative is a limit of difference quotients. For this reason, the derivative is sometimes called the slope of the function ''f''.

Here is a particular example, the derivative of the squaring function at the input 3. Let ''f''(''x'') = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; be the squaring function.

[[File:Sec2tan.gif|thumb|300px|The derivative ''f′''(''x'') of a curve at a point is the slope of the line tangent to that curve at that point. This slope is determined by considering the limiting value of the slopes of secant lines. Here the function involved (drawn in red) is ''f''(''x'') = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; − ''x''. The tangent line (in green) which passes through the point (−3/2, −15/8) has a slope of 23/4. Note that the vertical and horizontal scales in this image are different.]]

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}f'(3) &amp;=\lim_{h \to 0}{(3+h)^2 - 3^2\over{h}} \\
&amp;=\lim_{h \to 0}{9 + 6h + h^2 - 9\over{h}} \\
&amp;=\lim_{h \to 0}{6h + h^2\over{h}} \\
&amp;=\lim_{h \to 0} (6 + h) \\
&amp;= 6.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The slope of tangent line to the squaring function at the point (3,9) is 6, that is to say, it is going up six times as fast as it is going to the right. The limit process just described can be performed for any point in the domain of the squaring function. This defines the ''derivative function'' of the squaring function, or just the ''derivative'' of the squaring function for short. A similar computation to the one above shows that the derivative of the squaring function is the doubling function.

=== Leibniz notation ===
{{Main|Leibniz's notation}}

A common notation, introduced by Leibniz, for the derivative in the example above is
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
y=x^2 \\
\frac{dy}{dx}=2x.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
In an approach based on limits, the symbol ''dy/dx'' is to be interpreted not as the quotient of two numbers but as a shorthand for the limit computed above. Leibniz, however, did intend it to represent the quotient of two infinitesimally small numbers, ''dy'' being the infinitesimally small change in ''y'' caused by an infinitesimally small change ''dx'' applied to ''x''. We can also think of ''d/dx'' as a differentiation operator, which takes a function as an input and gives another function, the derivative, as the output. For example:
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{d}{dx}(x^2)=2x.
&lt;/math&gt;
In this usage, the ''dx'' in the denominator is read as &quot;with respect to x&quot;. Even when calculus is developed using limits rather than infinitesimals, it is common to manipulate symbols like ''dx'' and ''dy'' as if they were real numbers; although it is possible to avoid such manipulations, they are sometimes notationally convenient in expressing operations such as the [[total derivative]].

=== Integral calculus ===
{{Main|Integral}}

'''Integral calculus''' is the study of the definitions, properties, and applications of two related concepts, the ''indefinite integral'' and the ''definite integral''. The process of finding the value of an integral is called ''integration''. In technical language, integral calculus studies two related [[linear operator]]s.

The '''indefinite integral''' is the ''[[antiderivative]]'', the inverse operation to the derivative. ''F'' is an indefinite integral of ''f'' when ''f'' is a derivative of ''F''.  (This use of upper- and lower-case letters for a function and its indefinite integral is common in calculus.)

The '''definite integral''' inputs a function and outputs a number, which gives the area between the graph of the input and the [[x-axis]]. The technical definition of the definite integral is the [[limit (mathematics)|limit]] of a sum of areas of rectangles, called a [[Riemann sum]].

A motivating example is the distances traveled in a given time.

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Distance} = \mathrm{Speed} \cdot \mathrm{Time}&lt;/math&gt;

If the speed is constant, only multiplication is needed, but if the speed changes, then we need a more powerful method of finding the distance. One such method is to approximate the distance traveled by breaking up the time into many short intervals of time, then multiplying the time elapsed in each interval by one of the speeds in that interval, and then taking the sum (a [[Riemann sum]]) of the approximate distance traveled in each interval. The basic idea is that if only a short time elapses, then the speed will stay more or less the same. However, a Riemann sum only gives an approximation of the distance traveled. We must take the limit of all such Riemann sums to find the exact distance traveled.

[[File:Integral as region under curve.svg|left|thumb|280px|Integration can be thought of as measuring the area under a curve, defined by ''f''(''x''), between two points (here ''a'' and ''b'').]]

If ''f(x)'' in the diagram on the left represents speed as it varies over time, the distance traveled (between the times represented by ''a'' and ''b'') is the area of the shaded region ''s''.

To approximate that area, an intuitive method would be to divide up the distance between ''a'' and ''b'' into a number of equal segments, the length of each segment represented by the symbol ''Δx''. For each small segment, we can choose one value of the function ''f''(''x''). Call that value ''h''. Then the area of the rectangle with base ''Δx'' and height ''h'' gives the distance (time ''Δx'' multiplied by speed ''h'') traveled in that segment.   Associated with each segment is the average value of the function above it, ''f(x)''=h. The sum of all such rectangles gives an approximation of the area between the axis and the curve, which is an approximation of the total distance traveled. A smaller value for ''Δx'' will give more rectangles and in most cases a better approximation, but for an exact answer we need to take a limit as ''Δx'' approaches zero.

The symbol of integration is &lt;math&gt;\int \,&lt;/math&gt;, an elongated ''S'' (the S stands for &quot;sum&quot;). The definite integral is written as:

:&lt;math&gt;\int_a^b f(x)\, dx.&lt;/math&gt;

and is read &quot;the integral from ''a'' to ''b'' of ''f''-of-''x'' with respect to ''x''.&quot;  The Leibniz notation ''dx'' is intended to suggest dividing the area under the curve into an infinite number of rectangles, so that their width ''Δx'' becomes the infinitesimally small ''dx''.  In a formulation of the calculus based on limits, the notation

:&lt;math&gt;\int_a^b \ldots\, dx&lt;/math&gt;

is to be understood as an operator that takes a function as an input and gives a number, the area, as an output; ''dx'' is not a number, and is not being multiplied by ''f(x)''.

The indefinite integral, or antiderivative, is written:

:&lt;math&gt;\int f(x)\, dx.&lt;/math&gt;

Functions differing by only a constant have the same derivative, and therefore the antiderivative of a given function is actually a family of functions differing only by a constant. Since the derivative of the function ''y'' = ''x''² + ''C'', where ''C'' is any constant, is ''y′'' = 2''x'', the antiderivative of the latter is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;\int 2x\, dx = x^2 + C.&lt;/math&gt;
An undetermined constant like ''C'' in the antiderivative is known as a [[constant of integration]].

=== Fundamental theorem ===
{{Main|Fundamental theorem of calculus}}
The [[fundamental theorem of calculus]] states that differentiation and integration are inverse operations. More precisely, it relates the values of antiderivatives to definite integrals. Because it is usually easier to compute an antiderivative than to apply the definition of a definite integral, the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus provides a practical way of computing definite integrals. It can also be interpreted as a precise statement of the fact that differentiation is the inverse of integration.

The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus states: If a function ''f'' is [[continuous function|continuous]] on the interval [''a'', ''b''] and if ''F'' is a function whose derivative is ''f'' on the interval (''a'', ''b''), then

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{a}^{b} f(x)\,dx = F(b) - F(a).&lt;/math&gt;

Furthermore, for every ''x'' in the interval (''a'', ''b''),

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}\int_a^x f(t)\, dt = f(x).&lt;/math&gt;

This realization, made by both [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] and [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]], who based their results on earlier work by [[Isaac Barrow]], was key to the massive proliferation of analytic results after their work became known. The fundamental theorem provides an algebraic method of computing many definite integrals—without performing limit processes—by finding formulas for [[antiderivative]]s. It is also a prototype solution of a [[differential equation]]. Differential equations relate an unknown function to its derivatives, and are ubiquitous in the sciences.

== Applications ==

[[File:NautilusCutawayLogarithmicSpiral.jpg|thumb|right|The [[logarithmic spiral]] of the [[Nautilus|Nautilus shell]] is a classical image used to depict the growth and change related to calculus]]
Calculus is used in every branch of the [[physical science]]s, [[actuarial science]], [[computer science]], [[statistics]], [[engineering]], [[economics]], [[business]], [[medicine]], [[demography]], and in other fields wherever a problem can be [[mathematical model|mathematically modeled]] and an [[optimization (mathematics)|optimal]] solution is desired. It allows one to go from (non-constant) rates of change to the total change or vice versa, and many times in studying a problem we know one and are trying to find the other.

[[Physics]] makes particular use of calculus; all concepts in [[classical mechanics]] and [[electromagnetism]] are interrelated through calculus. The [[mass]] of an object of known [[density]], the [[moment of inertia]] of objects, as well as the total energy of an object within a conservative field can be found by the use of calculus. An example of the use of calculus in mechanics is [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's second law of motion]]: historically stated it expressly uses the term &quot;rate of change&quot; which refers to the derivative saying ''The'' '''rate of change''' ''of momentum of a body is equal to the resultant force acting on the body and is in the same direction.'' Commonly expressed today as Force&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;Mass&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;acceleration, it involves differential calculus because acceleration is the time derivative of velocity or second time derivative of trajectory or spatial position. Starting from knowing how an object is accelerating, we use calculus to derive its path.

Maxwell's theory of [[electromagnetism]] and [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s theory of [[general relativity]] are also expressed in the language of differential calculus. Chemistry also uses calculus in determining reaction rates and radioactive decay. In biology, population dynamics starts with reproduction and death rates to model population changes.

Calculus can be used in conjunction with other mathematical disciplines. For example, it can be used with [[linear algebra]] to find the &quot;best fit&quot; linear approximation for a set of points in a domain. Or it can be used in [[probability theory]] to determine the probability of a continuous random variable from an assumed density function. In [[analytic geometry]], the study of graphs of functions, calculus is used to find high points and low points (maxima and minima), slope, [[Concave function|concavity]] and [[inflection points]].

[[Green's Theorem]], which gives the relationship between a line integral around a simple closed curve C and a double integral over the plane region D bounded by C, is applied in an instrument known as a [[planimeter]] which is used to calculate the area of a flat surface on a drawing. For example, it can be used to calculate the amount of area taken up by an irregularly shaped flower bed or swimming pool when designing the layout of a piece of property.

In the realm of medicine, calculus can be used to find the optimal branching angle of a blood vessel so as to maximize flow. From the decay laws for a particular drug's elimination from the body, it's used to derive dosing laws. In nuclear medicine, it's used to build models of radiation transport in targeted tumor therapies.

In economics, calculus allows for the determination of maximal profit by providing a way to easily calculate both [[marginal cost]] and [[marginal revenue]].

Calculus is also used to find approximate solutions to equations; in practice it's the standard way to solve differential equations and do root finding in most applications. Examples are methods such as [[Newton's method]], [[fixed point iteration]], and [[linear approximation]]. For instance, spacecraft use a variation of the [[Euler method]] to approximate curved courses within zero gravity environments.

'''Communication''' is the activity of conveying [[Meaning_(philosophy_of_language)|meaningful]] [[information]]. Communication requires a sender, a message, and an intended recipient, although the receiver need not be present or aware of the sender's intent to communicate at the time of communication; thus communication can occur across vast distances in time and space. Communication requires that the communicating parties share an area of communicative commonality. The communication process is complete once the receiver has understood the sender.

==Human communication==
[[Human]] spoken and picture languages can be described as a [[system]] of [[symbol]]s (sometimes known as [[lexeme]]s) and the [[grammar]]s ([[wikt:rule|rules]]) by which the symbols are manipulated. The word &quot;language&quot; also refers to common properties of languages. [[Language acquisition|Language learning]] normally occurs most intensively during human childhood. Most of the thousands of human languages use patterns of [[sound]] or [[gesture]] for symbols which enable communication with others around them.  Languages seem to share certain properties, although many of these include exceptions. There is [[language or dialect|no defined line]] between a language and a [[dialect]]. [[Constructed language]]s such as [[Esperanto]], [[programming language]]s, and various mathematical formalisms are not necessarily restricted to the properties shared by human languages.

A variety of verbal and non-verbal means of communicating exists such as [[body language]], [[eye contact]], [[sign language]], [[paralanguage]], [[haptic communication]], [[chronemics]],  and media such as pictures, graphics, sound, and [[writing]]. 

[[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]] also defines the communication to include the [[display]] of text, [[Braille]], [[tactile]] communication, [[large print]], accessible [[multimedia]], as well as written and [[plain language]], human reader, and accessible [[information and communication technology]].&lt;ref&gt;Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disability, Article 2, Definition&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nonverbal communication===
[[Nonverbal communication]] describes the process of conveying meaning in the form of non-word messages. Research shows that the majority of our communication is non verbal, also known as body language. some of non verbal communication includes  [[gesture]], [[body language]] or [[Human position|posture]]; [[facial expression]] and eye contact, object communication such as [[clothing]], [[hairstyles]], [[architecture]], [[symbols]] [[infographics]], and tone of voice as well as through an aggregate of the above.  Non-verbal communication is also called silent language and plays a key role in human day to day life from employment relations to romantic engagements.

Speech also contains nonverbal elements known as [[paralanguage]]. These include voice quality, emotion and speaking style as well as prosodic features such as [[rhythm]], [[intonation (linguistics)|intonation]] and [[Stress (biological)|stress]]. Likewise, written texts include nonverbal elements such as handwriting style, spatial arrangement of words and the use of [[emoticons]] to convey emotional expressions in pictorial form.

===Visual communication===
[[Visual communication]] is  the conveyance of ideas and information through creation of visual representations. Primarily associated with [[Dimension|two dimensional]] images, it includes: [[sign (linguistics)|sign]]s, [[typography]], [[drawing]], [[graphic design]], [[illustration]], colours, and electronic resources, video and TV. Recent research in the field has focused on [[web design]] and graphically oriented usability. [[Graphic designers]] use methods of visual communication in their professional practice.

===Oral communication===
[[Oral communication]], while primarily referring to spoken verbal communication, typically relies on both words, visual aids and non-verbal elements to support the conveyance of the meaning. Oral communication includes discussion, speeches, presentations, interpersonal communication and many other varieties. In face to face communication the [[body language]] and voice tonality plays a significant role and may have a greater impact on the listener than the intended content of the spoken words.

A great presenter must capture the attention of the audience and connect with them. For example, out of two persons telling the same joke one may greatly amuse the audience due to his body language and tone of voice while the second person, using exactly the same words, bores and irritates the audience. {{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} Visual aid can help to facilitate effective communication and is almost always used in presentations for an audience.

A widely cited and widely misinterpreted figure used to emphasize the importance of delivery states that &quot;communication comprise 55% body language, 38% tone of voice, 7% content of words&quot;, the so-called &quot;7%-38%-55% rule&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Albert Mehrabian|last=Mehrabian|first=Albert|year=1971|title=Silent Messages|edition=1st|publisher=[[Cengage Learning|Wadsworth]]|location=[[Belmont, CA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is not however what the cited research shows – rather, when conveying ''emotion,'' if body language, tone of voice, and words ''disagree,'' then body language and tone of voice will be believed more than words.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hodu.com/rule.shtml Debunking the 55%, 38%, 7% Rule], by Judith E. Pearson&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|date=April 2010|reason=This is not a proper reference citation. Use [[Cite web]] or similar to provide source details.}} For example, a person saying &quot;I'm delighted to meet you&quot; while mumbling, hunched over, and looking away will be interpreted as insincere. ''(Further discussion at [[Albert Mehrabian#Three elements of communication|Albert Mehrabian: Three elements of communication]].)'

===Written communication and its historical development===
Over time the forms of and ideas about communication have evolved through progression of technology. Advances include communications psychology and media psychology; an emerging field of study.  Researchers divides the progression of written communication into three revolutionary stages called &quot;Information Communication Revolutions&quot; (Source needed).

During the 1st stage written communication first emerged through the use of pictographs.  The pictograms were made in stone, hence written communication was not yet mobile.

During the 2nd stage writing began to appear on paper, papyrus, clay, wax, etc. Common alphabets were introduced and allowed for the uniformity of language across large distances. A leap in technology occurred when the Gutenberg printing-press was invented in the 15th century.

The 3rd stage is characterised by the transfer of information through controlled waves and electronic signals.

Communication is thus a process by which meaning is assigned and conveyed in an attempt to create shared understanding. This process, which requires a vast repertoire of skills in [[interpersonal]] processing, listening, observing, speaking, questioning, analyzing, gestures, and evaluating enables [[collaboration]] and [[cooperation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=communication|work=office of superintendent of Public Instruction|location=Washington|url=ruct/Communications/default.aspx |accessdate=March 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barriers to successful communication include ''message overload'' (when a person receives too many messages at the same time), and ''message complexity''.&lt;ref&gt;Montana, Patrick J. &amp; Charnov, Bruce H. 2008. Management. 4th ed. New York. Barron's Educational Series, Inc. Pg 333.&lt;/ref&gt;

Misunderstandings can be anticipated and solved through formulations, questions and answers, paraphrasing, examples, and stories of strategic talk. Written communication can be clear by planning follow-up talk on critical written communication as part of the normal way of doing business. Minutes spent talking now will save time later having to clear up misunderstandings later on. Then, take what was heard and reiterate in your own words, and ask them if that’s what they meant.  &lt;ref&gt;Heyman, Richard. Why Didn't You Say That in the First Place? How to Be Understood at Work. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Nonhuman communication==
{{See also|Biocommunication (science)|Interspecies communication}}
Every [[information exchange]] between living organisms — i.e. transmission of [[Signalling theory|signal]]s that involve a living sender and [[Receiver (information theory)|receiver]] can be considered a form of communication; and even primitive creatures such as corals are competent to communicate. Nonhuman communication also include [[cell signaling]], [[Cellular communication (biology)|cellular communication]], and chemical transmissions between primitive organisms like [[bacteria]] and within the [[plant]] and [[fungi|fungal]] kingdoms.

===Animal communication===
The broad field of [[animal communication]] encompasses most of the issues in [[ethology]]. [[Animal communication]] can be defined as any [[behavior]] of one animal that affects the current or future behavior of another animal. The study of animal communication, called ''zoosemiotics''' (distinguishable from [[anthroposemiotics]], the study of human communication) has played an important part in the development of [[ethology]], [[sociobiology]], and the study of [[animal cognition]]. Animal communication, and indeed the understanding of the animal world in general, is a rapidly growing field, and even in the 21st century so far, many prior understandings related to diverse fields such as personal symbolic [[name]] use, [[emotion in animals|animal emotions]], [[animal culture]] and [[animal learning|learning]], and even [[animal sexuality|sexual conduct]], long thought to be well understood, have been revolutionized.

===Plants and fungi===
Communication is observed within the plant organism, i.e. within [[plant cells]] and between plant cells, between plants of the same or related species, and between plants and non-plant organisms, especially in the [[rhizosphere|root zone]]. [[Plant root]]s communicate in parallel with [[rhizome]] [[bacteria]], with [[fungi]] and with insects in the [[soil]]. These parallel sign-mediated interactions are governed by syntactic, pragmatic and semantic rules, and are possible because of the decentralized &quot;nervous system&quot; of plants. The original meaning of the word &quot;neuron&quot; in Greek is &quot;vegetable fiber&quot; and recent research has shown that most of the intraorganismic plant communication processes are [[neuronal]]-like.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Baluska |first1=F. |last2=Marcuso |first2=Stefano |last3=Volkmann |first3=Dieter |title=Communication in plants: neuronal aspects of plant life   |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=IH9N4SKWTokC&amp;pg=PA19&amp;dq=plant+communication+processes+are+neuronal-like#v=onepage&amp;q=plant%20communication%20processes%20are%20neuron-like&amp;f=false |page=19 |year=2006 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis US |isbn=3540284758 |quote=...the emergence of plant neurobiology as the most recent area of plant sciences.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plants also communicate via [[volatile oil|volatile]]s when exposed to [[herbivory]] attack behavior to warn neighboring plants. In parallel they produce other volatiles to attract [[parasitism|parasites]] which attack these herbivores. In [[Abiotic stress|Stress]] situations plants can overwrite the [[genetic code]] they inherited from their parents and revert to that of their grand- or great-grandparents.

Fungi communicate to coordinate and organize their growth and development such as the formation of [[mycelium|mycelia]] and [[fruiting body|fruiting bodies]]. Fungi communicate with same and related species as well as with nonfungal organisms in a great variety of symbiotic interactions, especially with bacteria, [[unicellular]] eukaryotes, plants and insects through semiochemicals of biotic origin. The semiochemicals trigger the fungal organism to react in a specific manner, while if the same chemical molecules are not part of biotic messages, they do not trigger the fungal organism to react. This implies that fungal organisms can differ between molecules taking part in biotic messages and similar molecules being irrelevant in the situation. So far five different primary signalling molecules are known to coordinate different behavioral patterns such as [[filamentation]], [[mating]], growth, and [[pathogenicity]]. Behavioral coordination and production of signalling substances is achieved through interpretation processes that enables the organism to differ between self or non-self, abiotic indicator, biotic message from similar, related, or non-related species, and even filter out &quot;noise&quot;, i.e. similar molecules without biotic content.

The first major model for communication came in 1949 by Claude Shannon and Warren Weaver for Bell Laboratories &lt;ref&gt;Shannon, C. E., &amp; Weaver, W. (1949). ''The mathematical theory of communication''. Urbana, Illinois: [[University of Illinois Press]]&lt;/ref&gt; The original model was designed to mirror the functioning of radio and telephone technologies. Their initial model consisted of three primary parts: sender, channel, and receiver. The sender was the part of a telephone a person spoke into, the channel was the telephone itself, and the receiver was the part of the phone where one could hear the other person. Shannon and Weaver also recognized that often there is static that interferes with one listening to a telephone conversation, which they deemed noise.

In a simple model, often referred to as the transmission model or standard view of communication, information or content (e.g. a message in [[natural language]]) is sent in some form (as [[spoken language]]) from an emisor/ sender/ [[encoder]] to a destination/ receiver/ [[decoder]]. This common conception of communication simply views communication as a means of sending and receiving information. The strengths of this model are simplicity, generality, and quantifiability. Social scientists Claude Shannon and Warren Weaver structured this model based on the following elements:

# An information source, which produces a message.
# A transmitter, which encodes the message into signals
# A channel, to which signals are adapted for transmission
# A receiver, which 'decodes' (reconstructs) the message from the signal.
# A destination, where the message arrives.

Shannon and Weaver argued that there were three levels of problems for communication within this theory.
:The technical problem: how accurately can the message be transmitted?
:The semantic problem: how precisely is the meaning 'conveyed'?
:The effectiveness problem: how effectively does the received meaning affect behavior?

Daniel Chandler critiques the transmission model by stating:
:It assumes communicators are isolated individuals.
:No allowance for differing purposes.
:No allowance for differing interpretations.
:No allowance for unequal power relations.
:No allowance for situational contexts.

In 1960, David Berlo expanded on Shannon and Weaver’s (1949) linear model of communication and created the SMCR Model of Communication.&lt;ref&gt;Berlo, D. K. (1960).'' The process of communication''. New York, New York: Holt, Rinehart, &amp; Winston.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Sender-Message-Channel-Receiver Model of communication separated the model into clear parts and has been expanded upon by other scholars.

Communication is usually described along a few major dimensions: Message (what type of things are communicated), source / emisor / sender / [[encoder]] (by whom), form (in which form), channel (through which [[media (communication)|medium]]), destination / receiver / target / [[decoder]] (to whom), and Receiver. Wilbur Schram (1954) also indicated that we should also examine the impact that a message has (both desired and undesired) on the target of the message.&lt;ref&gt;Schramm, W. (1954). How communication works. In W. Schramm (Ed.), ''The process and effects of communication'' (pp. 3-26). Urbana, Illinois: University of Illinois Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Between parties, communication includes acts that confer knowledge and experiences, give advice and commands, and ask questions. These acts may take many forms, in one of the various manners of communication. The form depends on the abilities of the group communicating. Together, communication content and form make [[message]]s that are sent towards a destination. The target can be oneself, another [[Interpersonal Communication|person]] or being, another entity (such as a corporation or group of beings).

Communication can be seen as processes of [[information transmission]] governed by three levels of [[semiotic]] rules:
#[[Syntactic]] (formal properties of signs and symbols),
#[[Pragmatics|Pragmatic]] (concerned with the relations between signs/expressions and their users) and
#[[Semantic]] (study of relationships between signs and symbols and what they represent).

Therefore, communication is [[Interpersonal relationship|social interaction]] where at least two interacting agents share a common set of signs and a common set of [[semiotic]] rules. This commonly held rules in some sense ignores [[semiotics|autocommunication]], including [[intrapersonal communication]] via [[diary|diaries]] or self-talk, both secondary phenomena that followed the primary acquisition of communicative competences within social interactions.

In light of these weaknesses, Barnlund (2008) proposed a transactional model of communication.&lt;ref&gt;Barnlund, D. C. (2008). A transactional model of communication. In. C. D. Mortensen (Eds.), ''Communication theory'' (2nd ed., pp47-57). New Brunswick, New Jersey: Transaction.&lt;/ref&gt;  The basic premise of the transactional model of communication is that individuals are simultaneously engaging in the sending and receiving of messages.

In a slightly more complex form a sender and a receiver are linked [[wikt:reciprocal|reciprocally]]. This second attitude of communication, referred to as the constitutive model or constructionist view, focuses on how an individual communicates as the determining factor of the way the message will be interpreted. Communication is viewed as a conduit; a passage in which information travels from one individual to another and this information becomes separate from the communication itself. A particular instance of communication is called a [[speech act]].  The sender's personal filters and the receiver's personal filters may vary depending upon different regional traditions, cultures, or gender; which may alter the intended meaning of message contents.  In the presence of &quot;[[noise|communication noise]]&quot; on the transmission channel (air, in this case), reception and decoding of content may be faulty, and thus the speech act may not achieve the desired effect. One problem with this encode-transmit-receive-decode model is that the processes of encoding and decoding imply that the sender and receiver each possess something that functions as a [[codebook]], and that these two code books are, at the very least, similar if not identical.  Although something like code books is implied by the model, they are nowhere represented in the model, which creates many conceptual difficulties.

Theories of [[coregulation]] describe communication as a creative and dynamic continuous process, rather than a discrete exchange of information. Canadian media scholar [[Harold Innis]] had the theory that people use different types of media to communicate and which one they choose to use will offer different possibilities for the shape and durability of society (Wark, McKenzie 1997). His famous example of this is using [[ancient Egypt]] and looking at the ways they built themselves out of media with very different properties stone and papyrus. Papyrus is what he called ''''Space Binding''''. it made possible the transmission of written orders across space, empires and enables the waging of distant military campaigns and colonial administration. The other is stone and ''''Time Binding'''', through the construction of temples and the pyramids can sustain their authority generation to generation, through this media they can change and shape communication in their society (Wark, McKenzie 1997).

Bernard Luskin, UCLA, 1970, advanced computer assisted instruction and began to connect media and psychology into what is now the field of media psychology. In 1998, the American Association of Psychology, Media Psychology Division 46 Task Force report on psychology and new technologies combined media and communication as pictures, graphics and sound increasingly dominate modern communication.communicati

==Communication noise==
In any communication model, noise is interference with the decoding of messages sent over a channel by an encoder. There are many examples of noise:

'''Environmental Noise:''' Noise that physically disrupts communication, such as standing next to loud speakers at a party, or the noise from a construction site next to a classroom making it difficult to hear the professor.

'''Physiological-Impairment Noise:''' Physical maladies that prevent effective communication, such as actual deafness or blindness preventing messages from being received as they were intended.

'''Semantic Noise:''' Different interpretations of the meanings of certain words. For example, the word &quot;weed&quot; can be interpreted as an undesirable plant in your yard, or as a euphemism for marijuana.

'''Syntactical Noise:''' Mistakes in grammar can disrupt communication, such as abrupt changes in verb tense during a sentence.

'''Organizational Noise:''' Poorly structured communication can prevent the receiver from accurate interpretation. For example, unclear and badly stated directions can make the receiver even more lost.

'''Cultural Noise:''' Stereotypical assumptions can cause misunderstandings, such as unintentionally offending a non-Christian person by wishing them a &quot;Merry Christmas&quot;.

'''Psychological Noise:''' Certain attitudes can also make communication difficult. For instance, great anger or sadness may cause someone to lose focus on the present moment. Disorders such as Autism may also severely hamper effective communication.&lt;ref&gt;Roy M. Berko, et al., Communicating. 11th ed. (Boston, MA: Pearson Education, Inc., 2010) 9-12&lt;/ref&gt;

==Communication as academic discipline==&lt;!-- [[Code mixing]] links here --&gt;
{{Main|Communication theory}}
Communication as an academic discipline, sometimes called &quot;communicology,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.communicology.org/content/definition-communicology &quot;Communicology&quot;.org]&lt;/ref&gt; relates to all the ways we communicate, so it embraces a large body of study and knowledge. The communication discipline includes both verbal and nonverbal messages. A body of scholarship all about communication is presented and explained in textbooks, electronic publications, and academic journals. In the journals, researchers report the results of studies that are the basis for an ever-expanding understanding of how we all communicate.

Communication happens at many levels (even for one single action), in many different ways, and for most beings, as well as certain machines. Several, if not all, fields of study dedicate a portion of attention to communication, so when speaking about communication it is very important to be sure about what aspects of communication one is speaking about. Definitions of communication range widely, some recognizing that animals can communicate with each other as well as human beings, and some are more narrow, only including human beings within the different parameters of human symbolic interaction.

[[File:Homeros Caetani Louvre Ma440 n2.jpg|right|thumb|Bust of [[Homer]], ancient Greek epic poet.]]
'''Classics''' (sometimes encompassing '''Classical Studies''' or '''Classical Civilization''') is the branch of the [[Humanities]] comprising the [[language]]s, [[literature]], [[philosophy]], [[history]], [[art]], archaeology and other culture of the ancient [[Mediterranean]] world ([[Bronze Age]] ca. [[Before Christ|BC]] 3000 – [[Late Antiquity]] ca. [[Anno Domini|AD]] 300–600); especially [[Ancient Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome]] during [[Classical Antiquity]] (ca. BC 600 – AD 600). Initially, study of the Classics (the period's literature) was the principal study in the humanities.

==History of the Western Classics==
The word “classics” derives from the [[Latin]] [[adjective]] ''classicus'': “belonging to the highest class of citizens”, connoting ''superiority'', ''authority'', and ''perfection''. The first application of “Classic” to a writer was by [[Aulus Gellius]], a 2nd-century [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] writer who, in the [[miscellany]] ''Noctes Atticae'' (19, 8, 15), refers to a writer as a ''Classicus scriptor, non proletarius''(“A distinguished, not a commonplace writer”). Such classification began with the Greeks’ ''ranking'' their cultural works, with the word ''[[wikt:canon|canon]]'' (“carpenter’s rule”). Moreover, early [[Christianity|Christian]] Church Fathers used ''canon'' to rank the authoritative texts of the [[New Testament]], preserving them, given the expense of [[vellum]] and [[papyrus]] and mechanical book reproduction, thus, being comprehended in a ''canon'' ensured a book’s preservation as the best of a civilisation. Contemporarily, the [[Western canon]] defines the best of [[Western culture]]. In the ancient world, at the Alexandrian Library, scholars coined the Greek term ''Hoi enkrithentes'' (“the admitted”, “the included”) to identify the writers in the canon.

The method of study in the Classical World was “Philo’s Rule”: ''' μεταχάραττε τὸ θεῖον νόμισμα''' (lit.: &quot;strike the divine coin anew&quot;)—the law of ''strict continuity'' in preserving words and ideas.&lt;ref&gt;[[Werner Jaeger]], ''Paideia'', Eng. trans. 1939–44, vol. 2, p.xii.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the definitions of words and ideas might broaden, ''continuity'' (preservation) requires retention of their ''original'' [[arete (excellence)|arete]] (excellence, virtue, goodness). “Philo’s Rule” imparts intellectual and æsthetic ''appreciation'' of “the best which has been thought and said in the world”. To wit, Oxford classicist Edward Copleston said that classical education “communicates to the mind…a high sense of honour, a disdain of death in a good cause, [and] a passionate devotion to the welfare of one’s country”,&lt;ref&gt;Edward Copleston, ''The Victorians and Ancient Greece,'' Richard Jenkyns, 60.&lt;/ref&gt; thus concurring with [[Cicero]] that: “All literature, all philosophical treatises, all the voices of antiquity are full of examples for imitation, which would all lie unseen in darkness without the light of literature”.

==Legacy of the Classical World==
The Classical languages of the Ancient Mediterranean world influenced every European language, imparting to each a learned vocabulary of international application. Thus, Latin grew from a highly developed cultural product of the Golden and Silver eras of Latin literature to become the ''international lingua franca'' in matters diplomatic, scientific, philosophic and religious, until the 17th century. In turn, the Classical languages ''continued'', Latin evolved into [[Romance languages|the Romance languages]] and Ancient Greek into [[Modern Greek]] and its [[Modern Greek dialects|dialects]]. Moreover, it is in the specialised science and technology vocabularies that the [[Latin influence in English]] and the [[English words of Greek origin|Greek influence in English]] are notable, however, it is [[Ecclesiastical Latin]], the Roman Catholic Church’s official tongue, that remains a living legacy of the classical world to the contemporary world.

==Sub-disciplines within the classics==
One of the most notable characteristics of the modern study of classics is the diversity of the field. Although traditionally focused on ancient Greece and Rome, the study now encompasses the entire ancient Mediterranean world, thus expanding their studies to Northern [[Africa]] and parts of the [[Middle East]].

===Philology===
{{Main|Philology}}
Traditionally, classics was essentially the philology of ancient texts. Although now less dominant, philology retains a central role. One definition of classical philology describes it as &quot;the science which concerns itself with everything that has been transmitted from antiquity in the [[ancient Greek|Greek]] or [[classical Latin|Latin]] language. The object of this science is thus the Graeco-Roman, or Classical, world to the extent that it has left behind monuments in a linguistic form.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;J. and K. Kramer, ''La filologia classica'', 1979 as quoted by [Christopher S. Mackay|http://www.ualberta.ca/~csmackay/Philology.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Before the invention of the [[printing press]], texts were reproduced by hand and distributed haphazardly. As a result, extant versions of the same text often differ from one another. Some classical philologists, known as [[Textual criticism|textual critics]], seek to synthesize these defective texts to find the most accurate version.

===Archaeology===
{{Main|Classical archaeology}}
Classical archæology is the investigation of the physical remains of the great Mediterranean civilizations of Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome. The archæologists’ field, laboratory, library, and documentation work make available the extant literary and linguistic cultural artefacts to the field’s sub-disciplines, such as Philology. Like-wise, archæologists rely upon the philology of ancient literatures in establishing historic contexts among the classic-era remains of [[Mesopotamia]], [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]], Greece, and Rome.

===Art history===
{{Main|Art history}}
Some art historians focus their study of the development of art on the classical world. Indeed, the art and architecture of Ancient Rome and Greece is very well regarded and remains at the heart of much of our art today. For example, Ancient Greek architecture gave us the Classical Orders: [[Doric order]], [[Ionic order]], and [[Corinthian order]]. [[Parthenon|The Parthenon]] is still the architectural symbol of the classical world.

Greek sculpture is well known and we know the names of several Ancient Greek artists: for example, [[Phidias]].

===Civilization and history===
With philology, archæology, and art history, scholars seek understanding of the history and culture of a civilisation, through  critical study of the extant literary and physical artefacts, in order to compose and establish a ''continual'' historic narrative of the Ancient World and its peoples. The task is difficult, given the dearth of physical evidence; for example, [[Sparta]] was a leading Greek [[city-state]], yet little evidence of it survives to study, and what is available comes from [[Athens]], Sparta’s principal rival; like-wise, the [[Roman Empire]] destroyed most evidence (cultural artefacts) of earlier, conquered civilizations, such as that of the [[Etruscans]].

===Philosophy===
{{Main|Ancient philosophy}}
Pythagoras coined the word [[philosophy]] (“love of wisdom”), the work of the “Philosopher” who seeks understanding of the world as it is, thus, most classics scholars recognize that the roots of [[Western philosophy]] originate in [[Greek philosophy]], the works of [[Socrates]], [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], and the [[Stoics]].

==Classical Greece==
{{Main|Ancient Greece|Outline of ancient Greece|Timeline of ancient Greece}}

Ancient Greece is the civilization belonging to the period of Greek history lasting from the Archaic period of the 8th to 6th centuries BC to 146 BC and the Roman conquest of Greece after the Battle of Corinth. At the center of this time period is Classical Greece, which flourished during the 5th to 4th centuries BC, at first under Athenian leadership successfully repelling the military threat of Persian invasion. The Athenian Golden Age ends with the defeat of Athens at the hands of Sparta in the Peloponnesian War in 404 BC.

Classical Greek culture had a powerful influence on the Roman Empire, which carried a version of it to many parts of the Mediterranean region and Europe, for which reason Classical Greece is generally considered to be the seminal culture which provided the foundation of Western civilization.

=== Language in ancient Greece ===
{{Main|Ancient Greek|Mycenaean Greek language|Koine Greek}}

Ancient Greek is the historical stage in the development of the Greek language spanning the Archaic (c. 9th–6th centuries BC), Classical (c. 5th–4th centuries BC), and Hellenistic (c. 3rd century BC – 6th century AD) periods of ancient Greece and the ancient world. It is predated in the 2nd millennium BC by Mycenaean Greek. Its Hellenistic phase is known as Koine (&quot;common&quot;) or Biblical Greek, and its late period mutates imperceptibly into Medieval Greek. Koine is regarded as a separate historical stage of its own, although in its earlier form it closely resembles Classical Greek. Prior to the Koine period, Greek of the classic and earlier periods included several regional dialects.

Ancient Greek was the language of Homer and of classical Athenian historians, playwrights, and philosophers. It has contributed many words to English vocabulary and has been a standard subject of study in Western educational institutions since the Renaissance. Latinized forms of Ancient Greek roots are used in many of the scientific names of species and in scientific terminology.

=== Ancient Greek literature ===
{{Main|Ancient Greek literature}}

Alfred North Whitehead once claimed that all of philosophy is but a footnote to [[Plato]]. To suggest that all of Western literature is no more than a footnote to the writings of ancient Greece is an exaggeration, but it is nevertheless true that the Greek world of thought was so far-ranging that there is scarcely an idea discussed today not already debated by the ancient writers.  At the beginning of Greek literature stand the two monumental works of [[Homer]], the ''[[Iliad]]'' and the ''[[Odyssey]]''. The Greeks invented the epic and lyric forms of tragedy and used them skillfully. They also invented drama and produced masterpieces that are still reckoned as drama's crowning achievement. Like tragedy, comedy arose from a ritual in honor of Dionysus, but in this case the plays were full of frank obscenity, abuse, and insult. At Athens the comedies became an official part of the festival celebration in 486 BC, and prizes were offered for the best productions.

Two of the most famous historians who have ever written flourished during Greece's classical age: Herodotus and Thucydides. Herodotus is commonly called the father of history, and his &quot;History&quot; contains the first truly literary use of prose in Western literature. Of the two, Thucydides was the more careful historian. His critical use of sources, inclusion of documents, and laborious research made his History of the Peloponnesian War a significant influence on later generations of historians. The greatest achievement of the 4th century was in philosophy. There were many Greek philosophers, but three names tower above the rest: Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle. It is impossible to calculate the enormous influence these thinkers have had on Western society .

===Greek mythology and religion===
{{Main|Greek mythology|Religion in Ancient Greece}}

Greek mythology is the body of myths and legends belonging to the ancient Greeks concerning their gods and heroes, the nature of the world, and the origins and significance of their own cult and ritual practices. They were a part of religion in ancient Greece. Modern scholars refer to the myths and study them in an attempt to throw light on the religious and political institutions of Ancient Greece, its civilization, and to gain understanding of the nature of myth-making itself.

Greek religion encompasses the collection of beliefs and rituals practiced in ancient Greece in the form of both popular public religion and cult practices. These different groups varied enough for it to be possible to speak of Greek religions or &quot;cults&quot; in the plural, though most of them shared similarities. Also, the Greek religion extended out of Greece and out to other islands.

Many Greek people recognized the major gods and goddesses: Zeus, Poseidon, Hades, Apollo, Artemis, Aphrodite, Ares, Dionysus, Hephaestus, Athena, Hermes, Demeter, Hestia and Hera though philosophies such as Stoicism and some forms of Platonism used language that seems to posit a transcendent single deity. Different cities often worshipped the same deities, sometimes with epithets that distinguished them and specified their local nature.

=== Ancient Greek philosophy ===
{{Main|Ancient Greek philosophy}}

Ancient Greek philosophy arose in the 6th century BCE and continued through the Hellenistic period, at which point Ancient Greece was incorporated in the Roman Empire. It dealt with a wide variety of subjects, including political philosophy, ethics, metaphysics, ontology, logic, biology, rhetoric, and aesthetics.

Many philosophers today concede that Greek philosophy has shaped the entire Western thought since its inception.  Clear, unbroken lines of influence lead from ancient Greek and Hellenistic philosophers, to medieval Islamic philosophers, to the European Renaissance and Enlightenment.

=== Technology of ancient Greece ===
{{main|Ancient Greek technology}}

Ancient Greek technology developed at an unprecedented speed during the 5th century BC, continuing up to and including the Roman period, and beyond. Inventions that are credited to the ancient Greeks such as the gear, screw, rotary mills, screw press, bronze casting techniques, water clock, water organ, torsion catapult and the use of steam to operate some experimental machines and toys and a chart to find prime numbers. Many of these inventions occurred late in the Greek period, often inspired by the need to improve weapons and tactics in war. However, peaceful uses are shown by their early development of the watermill, a device which pointed to further exploitation on a large scale under the Romans. They developed surveying and mathematics to an advanced state, and many of their technical advances were published by philosophers such as Archimedes and Hero.

==Famous classicists==
Throughout the history of the Western world, many classicists have gone on to gain acknowledgement outside the field.
*[[John Milton]], author of ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' and [[English Civil War]] figure; studied, like many educated people of the time, Latin and Greek texts, which influenced ''Paradise Lost''
*[[George Berkeley]], philosopher, read Classics at [[Trinity College, Dublin]], where he was also Junior Lecturer in Greek
*[[Edward Gibbon]], English historian and [[Member of Parliament]] who wrote ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]''
*[[William Ewart Gladstone]], 19th century [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]], studied classics at [[Oxford University]]
*[[Theodor Mommsen]], author of ''[[History of Rome (Mommsen)|History of Rome]]'' and works on [[Roman law]]; German politician, delegate in the [[Reichstag (German Empire)|Reichstag]] during the [[German Empire]] period
*[[Karl Marx]], philosopher and political thinker, studied Latin and Greek and received a Ph.D. for a dissertation on ancient Greek philosophy, entitled &quot;The Difference between the Democritean and Epicurean Philosophy of Nature.&quot; His classical background is reflected in his philosophies—indeed the term &quot;[[proletariat]]&quot; which he coined came from that Latin word referring to the lowest class of citizen.
*[[Friedrich Nietzsche]], philosopher; earned [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] and became Professor of Classics at the [[University of Basel]] in [[Switzerland]]
*[[Sir James George Frazer]], poet and anthropologist
*[[Oscar Wilde]], nineteenth-century playwright and poet; studied classics at [[Trinity College, Dublin]] and [[Magdalen College, Oxford]]
*[[A.E. Housman]], best known to the public as a poet and the author of [[A Shropshire Lad]], was the most accomplished (and feared) textual critic of his generation and held the [[Kennedy Professorship of Latin]] at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] from 1911 until his death in 1936.
*[[John Buchan]], writer and politician, who served as [[Governor General of Canada]].
*[[P.G. Wodehouse]], writer, playwright, lyricist and creator of [[Jeeves]]; studied classics at [[Dulwich College]]
*[[Enoch Powell]], British [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] and later [[Ulster Unionist Party|Ulster Unionist]] politician; wrote and edited texts on [[Herodotus]]
*[[Boris Johnson]], British [[Conservative Party(UK)|Conservative]] politician and current [[Mayor of London]]; studied classics at [[Balliol College, Oxford]].

Most other pre-twentieth century [[Oxbridge]] playwrights, poets and English scholars studied classics before [[English studies]] became a course in its own right. Also many civil servants, politicians, etc. studied classics at [[Oxford University]], by taking a course in [[Greats]], up till the 1920s, when [[Modern Greats]] started to become more influential.

==Modern quotations about==
*&quot;Nor can I do better, in conclusion, than impress upon you the study of Greek literature, which not only elevates above the vulgar herd but leads not infrequently to positions of considerable emolument.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;—[[Thomas Gaisford]], Christmas sermon, [[Christ Church, Oxford]].
*&quot;I would make them all learn English: and then I would let the clever ones learn Latin as an honour, and Greek as a treat.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;—[[Winston Churchill|Sir Winston Churchill]], ''Roving Commission: My Early Life''
*&quot;He studied Latin like the violin, because he liked it.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;—[[Robert Frost]], ''The Death of the Hired Man''
*&quot;I enquire now as to the genesis of a philologist and assert the following: 1. A young man cannot possibly know what the Greeks and Romans are. 2. He does not know whether he is suited for finding out about them.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;—[[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Unzeitgemässe Betrachtungen]]
*&quot;I doubt whether classical education ever has been or can be successfully carried out without corporal punishment.&quot; &lt;br /&gt;—[[George Orwell]]
*&quot;It's economically illiterate. A degree in Classics or [[Philosophy]] can be as valuable as anything else.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;—[[Boris Johnson]]

Chemistry is the scientific study of interaction of [[chemical substance]]s that are constituted of [[atom]]s or the subatomic particles:&lt;ref&gt;[http://chemweb.ucc.ie/what_is_chemistry.htm What is Chemistry?]&lt;/ref&gt; [[proton]]s, [[electron]]s and [[neutron]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visionlearning.com/library/module_viewer.php?mid=49 Matter: Atoms from Democritus to Dalton] by Anthony Carpi, Ph.D.&lt;/ref&gt; Atoms combine to produce [[molecule]]s or [[crystal]]s. Chemistry is sometimes called &quot;[[the central science]]&quot; because it connects the other [[natural science]]s such as [[astronomy]], [[physics]], [[material science]], [[biology]] and [[geology]].&lt;ref&gt;Theodore L. Brown, H. Eugene Lemay, Bruce Edward Bursten, H. Lemay. ''Chemistry: The Central Science''. Prentice Hall; 8 edition (1999). ISBN 0-13-010310-1. Pages 3-4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;It is sometimes called the central science because it is seen as occupying an intermediate position in a hierarchy of the sciences by &quot;reductive level&quot;, between physics and biology. See Carsten Reinhardt. ''Chemical Sciences in the 20th Century: Bridging Boundaries''. Wiley-VCH, 2001. ISBN 3-527-30271-9. Pages 1-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

The genesis of chemistry can be traced to certain practices, known as [[alchemy]], which had been practiced for several [[millennia]] in various parts of the world, particularly the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;[http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/cgi-local/DHI/dhi.cgi?id=dv1-04 Dictionary of the History of Ideas: Alchemy]&lt;/ref&gt;

The structure of objects we commonly use and the properties of the matter we commonly interact with are a consequence of the properties of chemical substances and their interactions. For example, [[steel]] is [[Hardness (materials science)|harder]] than iron because its atoms are bound together in a more rigid [[crystalline lattice]]; wood burns or undergoes rapid [[oxidation]] because it can react spontaneously with [[oxygen]] in a [[chemical reaction]] above a certain [[temperature]]; sugar and salt dissolve in water because their molecular/ionic properties are such that dissolution is preferred under the ambient conditions.

The transformations that are studied in chemistry are a result of interaction either between different chemical substances or between [[matter]] and [[energy]]. Traditional chemistry involves study of [[chemical interaction|interactions]] between [[chemical substance|substances]] in a chemistry [[laboratory]] using various forms of [[laboratory glassware]].
[[Image:Lab bench.jpg|thumb|left|[[Laboratory]], Institute of Biochemistry, [[University of Cologne]]]]
A [[chemical reaction]] is a transformation of some substances into one or more other substances.&lt;ref&gt;IUPAC [[Gold Book]] [http://www.iupac.org/goldbook/C01033.pdf Definition]&lt;/ref&gt; It can be symbolically depicted through a [[chemical equation]]. The number of atoms on the left and the right in the equation for a chemical transformation is most often equal. The nature of chemical reactions a substance may undergo and the energy changes that may accompany it are constrained by certain basic rules, known as chemical laws.

[[Energy]] and [[entropy]] considerations are invariably important in almost all chemical studies. Chemical substances are classified in terms of their [[structure]], phase as well as their [[chemical composition]]s. They can be analyzed using the tools of [[chemical analysis]], e.g. [[spectroscopy]] and [[chromatography]]. [[Scientists]] engaged in chemical [[research]] are known as [[chemists]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.calmis.ca.gov/file/occguide/CHEMIST.HTM California Occupational Guide Number 22: Chemists]&lt;/ref&gt; Most chemists specialize in one or more sub-disciplines.

==History==
{{Main|History of chemistry}}
{{See also|Alchemy|Timeline of chemistry|Nobel Prize in Chemistry}}

[[Ancient Egypt]]ians pioneered the art of synthetic &quot;wet&quot; chemistry up to 4,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg16121734.300-first-chemists.html First chemists], February 13, 1999, New Scientist&lt;/ref&gt; By 1000 BC ancient civilizations were using technologies that formed the basis of the various branches of chemistry such as; extracting metal from their ores, making pottery and glazes, fermenting beer and wine, making pigments for cosmetics and painting, extracting chemicals from plants for medicine and perfume, making cheese, dying cloth, tanning leather, rendering fat into soap, making glass, and making alloys like bronze.
[[Image:Epicurus Louvre.jpg|right|thumb|180px|[[Democritus]]' atomist philosophy was later adopted by [[Epicurus]] (341–270 BCE).]]
The genesis of chemistry can be traced to the widely observed phenomenon of [[combustion|burning]] that led to [[metallurgy]]&amp;mdash;the art and science of processing ores to get metals (e.g. [[History of metallurgy in the Indian subcontinent|metallurgy in ancient India]]). The greed for gold led to the discovery of the process for its purification, even though the underlying principles were not well understood&amp;mdash;it was thought to be a transformation rather than purification. Many scholars in those days thought it reasonable to believe that there exist means for transforming cheaper (base) metals into gold. This gave way to alchemy and the search for the [[Philosopher's Stone]] which was believed to bring about such a transformation by mere touch.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chemheritage.org/explore/ancients-time.html Alchemy Timeline] - Chemical Heritage Society&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest pioneers of Chemistry, and inventors of the modern [[scientific method]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Morris Kline]] (1985) [http://books.google.com/books?id=f-e0bro-0FUC&amp;pg=PA284&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false ''Mathematics for the nonmathematician'']. [[Courier Dover Publications]]. p. 284. ISBN 0-486-24823-2&lt;/ref&gt; were medieval [[Alchemy and chemistry in medieval Islam|Arab and Persian scholars]]. They introduced precise [[observation]] and controlled [[experiment]]ation into the field and discovered numerous [[Chemical substance]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated162&quot;&gt;[[Will Durant]] (1980), ''The Age of Faith (The Story of Civilization, Volume 4)'', p. 162-186, Simon &amp; Schuster, ISBN 0-671-01200-2&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|date=September 2010}}

{{quote|&quot;Chemistry as a science was almost created by the Muslims; for in this field, where the Greeks (so far as we know) were confined to industrial experience and vague [[hypothesis]], the [[Saracen]]s introduced precise [[observation]], controlled [[experiment]], and careful records. They invented and named the [[alembic]] (al-anbiq), chemically analyzed innumerable [[Chemical substance|substances]], composed [[lapidary|lapidaries]], distinguished [[alkali]]s and [[acid]]s, investigated their affinities, studied and manufactured hundreds of [[drug]]s. Alchemy, which the Muslims inherited from Egypt, contributed to chemistry by a thousand incidental discoveries, and by its method, which was the most scientific of all medieval operations.&quot;}}&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated162&quot;/&gt;

The most influential Muslim chemists were [[Jābir ibn Hayyān]] (Geber, d. 815), [[al-Kindi]] (d. 873), [[al-Razi]] (d. 925), [[Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī|al-Biruni]] (d. 1048) and [[Alhazen]] (d. 1039).&lt;ref&gt;Dr. K. Ajram (1992), ''Miracle of Islamic Science'', Appendix B, Knowledge House Publishers, ISBN 0-911119-43-4.&lt;br /&gt;{{quote|&quot;[[Alexander von Humboldt|Humboldt]] regards the Muslims as the founders of chemistry.&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The works of Jābir became more widely known in Europe through [[Latin]] translations by a [[pseudo-Geber]] in 14th century [[Spain]], who also wrote some of his own books under the pen name &quot;Geber&quot;. The contribution of [[History of metallurgy in the Indian subcontinent|Indian alchemists and metallurgists]] in the development of chemistry was also quite significant.&lt;ref&gt;[[Will Durant]] (1935): Our Oriental Heritage: Simon &amp; Schuster:
&lt;br /&gt;{{quote|&quot;Something has been said about the chemical excellence of cast iron in ancient India, and about the high industrial development of the Gupta times, when India was looked to, even by Imperial Rome, as the most skilled of the nations in such chemical industries as dyeing, tanning, soap-making, glass and cement... By the sixth century the Hindus were far ahead of Europe in industrial chemistry; they were masters of calcination, distillation, sublimation, steaming, fixation, the production of light without heat, the mixing of anesthetic and soporific powders, and the preparation of metallic salts, compounds and alloys. The tempering of steel was brought in ancient India to a perfection unknown in Europe till our own times; King Porus is said to have selected, as a specially valuable gift from Alexander, not gold or silver, but thirty pounds of steel. The Moslems took much of this Hindu chemical science and industry to the Near East and Europe; the secret of manufacturing &quot;Damascus&quot; blades, for example, was taken by the Arabs from the Persians, and by the Persians from India.&quot;&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The emergence of chemistry in Europe was primarily due to the recurrent incidence of the [[Bubonic plague|plague]] and blights there during the so called [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} This gave rise to a need for medicines. It was thought that there exists a universal medicine called the [[Elixir of Life]] that can cure all diseases{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}, but like the Philosopher's Stone, it was never found.
[[Image:Antoine lavoisier color.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Antoine-Laurent de Lavoisier]] is considered the &quot;Father of Modern Chemistry&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eagle |first=Cassandra T. |coauthors=Jennifer Sloan |title=Marie Anne Paulze Lavoisier: The Mother of Modern Chemistry |journal=The Chemical Educator |year=1998 |volume=3 |issue=5 |pages=1&amp;nbsp;– 18 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/x14v35m5n8822v42/fulltext.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2007-12-14 |doi=10.1007/s00897980249a }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
For some practitioners, alchemy was an intellectual pursuit, over time, they got better at it. [[Paracelsus]] (1493&amp;ndash;1541), for example, rejected the 4-elemental theory and with only a vague understanding of his chemicals and medicines, formed a hybrid of alchemy and science in what was to be called ''[[iatrochemistry]]''. Similarly, the influences of philosophers such as [[Francis Bacon|Sir Francis Bacon]] (1561&amp;ndash;1626) and [[René Descartes]] (1596&amp;ndash;1650), who demanded more rigor in mathematics and in removing bias from scientific observations, led to a [[scientific revolution]]. In chemistry, this began with [[Robert Boyle]] (1627&amp;ndash;1691), who came up with an equation known as [[Boyle's Law]] about the characteristics of gaseous state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/boyle_robert.shtml BBC - History - Robert Boyle (1627 - 1691)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Chemistry indeed came of age when [[Antoine Lavoisier]] (1743&amp;ndash;1794), developed the theory of [[Conservation of mass]] in 1783; and the development of the [[Atomic Theory]] by [[John Dalton]] around 1800. The Law of Conservation of Mass resulted in the reformulation of chemistry based on this law{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} and the oxygen theory of combustion, which was largely based on the work of Lavoisier. Lavoisier's fundamental contributions to chemistry were a result of a conscious effort{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} to fit all experiments into the framework of a single theory. He established the consistent use of the chemical balance, used oxygen to overthrow the [[phlogiston theory]], and developed a new system of chemical nomenclature and made contribution to the modern metric system. Lavoisier also worked to translate the archaic and technical language of chemistry into something that could be easily understood by the largely uneducated masses, leading to an increased public interest in chemistry. All these advances in chemistry led to what is usually called the [[chemical revolution]]. The contributions of Lavoisier led to what is now called modern chemistry&amp;mdash;the chemistry that is studied in educational institutions all over the world. It is because of these and other contributions that [[Antoine Lavoisier]] is often celebrated as the &quot;[[People known as the father or mother of something|Father of Modern Chemistry]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Affinity, that Elusive Dream: A Genealogy of the Chemical Revolution | author = Mi Gyung Kim | publisher = MIT Press | year = 2003 |page = 440|isbn = 0262112736}}&lt;/ref&gt; The later discovery of [[Friedrich Wöhler]] that many natural substances, [[organic compound]]s, can indeed be synthesized in a chemistry [[laboratory]] also helped the modern chemistry to mature from its infancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title = The Development of Modern Chemistry | author = Ihde, Aaron John | publisher = Courier Dover Publications | year = 1984 | page = 164 | isbn = 0486642356}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[discoveries of the chemical elements|discovery of the chemical elements]] has a long history from the days of alchemy and culminating in the discovery of the [[periodic table]] of the chemical elements by [[Dmitri Mendeleev]] (1834&amp;ndash;1907)&lt;ref&gt;[http://chemistry.about.com/library/weekly/aa030303a.htm Timeline of Element Discovery] - About.com&lt;/ref&gt; and later discoveries of some [[synthetic elements]].

==Etymology==
{{Main|Chemistry (etymology)}}

The word ''chemistry'' comes from the word ''alchemy'', an earlier set of practices that encompassed elements of chemistry, metallurgy, philosophy, astrology, astronomy, mysticism and medicine; it is commonly thought of as the quest to turn lead or another common starting material into gold.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alchemylab.com/history_of_alchemy.htm Alchemy Lab: History of Alchemy]&lt;/ref&gt;  The word ''alchemy'' in turn is derived from the [[Arabic]] word al-kīmīā (الكيمياء), meaning alchemy.  The Arabic term is borrowed from the Greek χημία or χημεία.&lt;ref name=oed&gt;&quot;alchemy&quot;, entry in ''The Oxford English Dictionary'', J. A. Simpson and E. S. C. Weiner, vol. 1, 2nd ed., 1989, ISBN 0-19-861213-3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;p. 854, &quot;Arabic alchemy&quot;, Georges C. Anawati, pp. 853-885 in ''Encyclopedia of the history of Arabic science'', eds. Roshdi Rashed and Régis Morelon, London: Routledge, 1996, vol. 3, ISBN 0415124123.&lt;/ref&gt;  This may have  [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] origins. Many believe that al-kīmīā is derived from χημία, which is in turn derived from the word '''Chemi''' or '''Kimi''', which is the ancient name of [[Egypt]] in [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]].&lt;ref name=oed /&gt;  Alternately, al-kīmīā may be derived from χημεία, meaning &quot;cast together&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Weekley, Ernest (1967). Etymological Dictionary of Modern English. New York: Dover Publications. ISBN 0486218732&lt;/ref&gt;  

An alchemist was called a 'chemist' in popular speech, and later the suffix &quot;-ry&quot; was added to this to describe the art of the chemist as &quot;chemistry&quot;.

==Definitions==
In retrospect, the definition of chemistry has changed over time, as new discoveries and theories add to the functionality of the science. Shown below are some of the standard definitions used by various noted chemists:
* '''Alchemy''' (330) – the study of the composition of waters, movement, growth, embodying, disembodying, drawing the spirits from bodies and bonding the spirits within bodies ([[Zosimos of Panopolis|Zosimos]]).&lt;ref&gt;Strathern, P. (2000). ''Mendeleyev’s Dream – the Quest for the Elements.'' New York: Berkley Books.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Chymistry''' (1661) – the subject of the material principles of mixed bodies ([[Robert Boyle|Boyle]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last=Boyle | first = Robert |title=The Sceptical Chymist|location=New York | publisher=Dover Publications, Inc. (reprint)|year=1661|isbn=0486428257}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Chymistry''' (1663) – a scientific art, by which one learns to dissolve bodies, and draw from them the different substances on their composition, and how to unite them again, and exalt them to a higher perfection ([[Christopher Glaser|Glaser]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last=Glaser | first = Christopher |title=Traite de la chymie|location=Paris | year=1663}} as found in: {{Cite book| last = Kim | first = Mi Gyung | title = Affinity, That Elusive Dream - A Genealogy of the Chemical Revolution | publisher = The MIT Press | year = 2003 | isbn = 0-262-11273-6}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Chemistry''' (1730) – the art of resolving mixt, compound, or aggregate bodies into their principles; and of composing such bodies from those principles ([[Georg Ernst Stahl|Stahl]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last=Stahl | first = George, E. |title=Philosophical Principles of Universal Chemistry|location=London | year=1730}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basic concepts==
Several [[concepts]] are essential for the study of chemistry; some of them are:&lt;ref&gt;[http://antoine.frostburg.edu/chem/senese/101/matter/ General Chemistry Online - Companion Notes: Matter]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Atom===
{{Main|Atom}}

An ''atom'' is the basic unit of chemistry. It consists of a positively charged core (the [[atomic nucleus]]) which contains [[protons]] and [[neutrons]], and which maintains a number of [[electron]]s to balance the positive charge in the nucleus. The atom is also the smallest entity that can be envisaged to retain some of the [[chemical properties]] of the element, such as [[electronegativity]], [[ionization potential]], preferred [[oxidation state]](s), [[coordination number]], and preferred types of [[chemical bond|bonds]] to form (e.g., [[metallic]], [[ion]]ic, [[covalent]]).

===Element===
{{Main|Chemical element}}

The concept of ''chemical element'' is related to that of chemical substance. A chemical element is specifically a substance which is composed of a single type of atom. A chemical element is characterized by a particular number of [[proton]]s in the [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]] of its atoms. This number is known as the [[atomic number]] of the element. For example, all atoms with 6 protons in their nuclei are atoms of the chemical element [[carbon]], and all atoms with 92 protons in their nuclei are atoms of the element [[uranium]]. Ninety–four different chemical elements or types of atoms based on the number of protons exist naturally. A further 18 have been recognised by [[IUPAC]] as existing artificially only.  Although all the nuclei of all atoms belonging to one element will have the same number of protons, they may not necessarily have the same number of [[neutrons]]; such atoms are termed [[isotopes]].  In fact several [[isotopes]] of an element may exist.

The most convenient presentation of the chemical elements is in the [[periodic table]] of the chemical elements, which groups elements by atomic number. Due to its ingenious arrangement, [[Periodic table group|groups]], or columns, and [[period (periodic table)|periods]], or rows, of elements in the table either share several chemical properties, or follow a certain trend in characteristics such as [[atomic radius]], [[electronegativity]], etc. Lists of the elements [[List of elements by name|by name]], [[List of elements by symbol|by symbol]], and by [[List of elements by number|atomic number]] are also available.

===Compound===
{{Main|Chemical compound}}

A ''compound'' is a substance with a ''particular ratio'' of atoms of particular [[chemical element]]s which determines its composition, and a particular [[chemical structure|organization]] which determines chemical properties. For example, [[water (molecule)|water]] is a compound containing [[hydrogen]] and [[oxygen]] in the ratio of two to one, with the oxygen atom between the two hydrogen atoms, and an angle of 104.5° between them. Compounds are formed and interconverted by [[chemical reaction]]s.

===Substance===
{{Main|Chemical substance}}

A chemical substance is a kind of matter with a definite [[chemical composition|composition]] and set of [[chemical properties|properties]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title = General Chemistry | author = Hill, J.W.; Petrucci, R.H.; McCreary, T.W.; Perry, S.S. | edition = 4th | publisher = Pearson Prentice Hall | location = Upper Saddle River, NJ | year = 2005 | page = 37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Strictly speaking, a mixture of compounds, elements or compounds and elements is not a chemical substance, but it may be called a chemical. Most of the substances we encounter in our daily life are some kind of mixture; for example: [[Earth's atmosphere|air]], [[alloy]]s, [[biomass]], etc.

Nomenclature of substances is a critical part of the language of chemistry. Generally it refers to a system for naming [[chemical compound]]s. Earlier in the history of chemistry substances were given name by their discoverer, which often led to some confusion and difficulty. However, today the IUPAC system of chemical nomenclature allows chemists to specify by name specific compounds amongst the vast variety of possible chemicals. The standard nomenclature of chemical substances is set by the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]] (IUPAC). There are well-defined systems in place for naming chemical species. [[Organic compound]]s are named according to the [[organic nomenclature]] system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acdlabs.com/iupac/nomenclature/ IUPAC Nomenclature of Organic Chemistry]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Inorganic compound]]s are named according to the [[inorganic nomenclature]] system.&lt;ref&gt;IUPAC Provisional Recommendations for the Nomenclature of Inorganic Chemistry (2004) [http://www.iupac.org/reports/provisional/abstract04/connelly_310804.html]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition the [[Chemical Abstracts Service]] has devised a method to index chemical substance. In this scheme each chemical substance is identifiable by a number known as [[CAS registry number]].

===Molecule===
{{Main|Molecule}}
A ''molecule'' is the smallest indivisible portion of a pure [[chemical substance]] that has its unique set of chemical properties, that is, its potential to undergo a certain set of chemical reactions with other substances. Molecules can exist as electrically neutral units unlike [[ions]]. Molecules are typically a set of atoms bound together by [[covalent bond]]s, such that the structure is electrically neutral and all valence electrons are paired with other electrons either in bonds or in [[lone pair]]s.
[[Image:Taxol.svg|400px|thumb|A molecular structure depicts the bonds and relative positions of atoms in a molecule such as that in [[Paclitaxel]] shown here]]

Not all substances consist of discrete molecules.  Most chemical elements are composed of lone atoms as their smallest discrete unit.  Other types of substances, such as [[ionic compounds]] and [[network solids]], are organized in such a way as to lack the existence of identifiable molecules ''per se''.  Instead, these substances are discussed in terms of [[formula unit]]s or [[unit cell]]s as the smallest repeating structure within the substance; as they lack identifiable molecules.

One of the main characteristic of a molecule is its geometry often called its [[molecular structure|structure]]. While the structure of diatomic, triatomic or tetra atomic molecules may be trivial, (linear, angular pyramidal etc.) the structure of polyatomic molecules, that are constituted of more than six atoms (of several elements) can be crucial for its chemical nature.

===Mole and amount of substance===
{{Main|Mole (unit)}}
Mole is a unit to measure [[amount of substance]] (also called chemical amount). A [[mole (unit)|mole]] is the amount of a [[Chemical substance|substance]] that contains as many elementary entities (atoms, molecules or ions) as there are atoms in 0.012 [[kilogram]] (or 12 [[gram]]s) of [[carbon-12]], where the carbon-12 atoms are unbound, at rest and in their [[ground state]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bipm.org/en/si/base_units/ Official SI Unit definitions]&lt;/ref&gt; The number of entities per mole is known as the [[Avogadro constant]], and is determined empirically. The currently accepted value is 6.02214179(30){{e|23}} mol&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; (2007 [[CODATA]]). One way to understand the meaning of the term &quot;mole&quot; is to compare and contrast it to terms such as [[dozen]]. Just as one dozen eggs contains 12 individual eggs, one mole contains 6.02214179(30){{e|23}} atoms, molecules or other particles. The term is used because it is much easier to say, for example, 1 mole of carbon, than it is to say 6.02214179(30){{e|23}} carbon atoms, and because moles of chemicals represent a scale that is easy to experience.

The amount of substance of a solute per volume of [[solution]] is known as amount of substance concentration, or [[molarity]] for short. Molarity is the quantity most commonly used to express the [[concentration]] of a solution in the chemical laboratory. The most commonly used units for molarity are mol/L (the official SI units are mol/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;).

===Ions and salts===
{{Main|Ion}}

An ''ion'' is a charged species, an atom or a molecule, that has lost or gained one or more electrons. Positively charged [[cations]] (e.g. [[sodium]] cation Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) and negatively charged [[anions]] (e.g. [[chloride]] Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) can form a crystalline lattice of neutral [[salt (chemistry)|salt]]s (e.g. [[sodium chloride]] NaCl). Examples of [[polyatomic ion]]s that do not split up during [[Acid-base reaction theories|acid-base reactions]] are [[hydroxide]] (OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) and [[phosphate]] (PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3−&lt;/sup&gt;).

Ions in the gaseous phase are often known as [[plasma (physics)|plasma]].

===Acidity and basicity===
{{Main|Acid–base reaction}}

A substance can often be classified as an [[acid]] or a [[base (chemistry)|base]]. There are several different theories which explain acid-base behavior.  The simplest is [[Arrhenius acid|Arrhenius theory]], which states than an acid is a substance that produces [[hydronium ion]]s when it is dissolved in water, and a base is one that produces [[hydroxide ion]]s when dissolved in water.  According to [[Brønsted–Lowry acid-base theory]], acids are substances that donate a positive [[hydrogen]] [[ion]] to another substance in a chemical reaction; by extension, a base is the substance which receives that hydrogen ion.  A third common theory is [[Lewis acids and bases|Lewis acid-base theory]], which is based on the formation of new [[chemical bond]]s.  Lewis theory explains that an acid is a substance which is capable of accepting a pair of electrons from another substance during the process of bond formation, while a base is a substance which can provide a pair of electrons to form a new bond.  According to concept as per Lewis, the crucial things being exchanged are charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.apsidium.com/theory/lewis_acid.htm | title = The Lewis Acid-Base Concept | accessdate = 2010-07-31 | date = May 19, 2003 | work = Apsidium | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080527132328/http://www.apsidium.com/theory/lewis_acid.htm | archivedate = 2008-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify credibility|date=July 2010}}&lt;!-- A nicely layed-out and informative page on Lewis; unfortunately the apsidium.com web site was anonymous and thus not &quot;reliable source&quot; --&gt; There are several other ways in which a substance may be classified as an acid or a base, as is evident in the history of this concept &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A708257 History of Acidity]&lt;/ref&gt;

Acid strength is commonly measured by two methods.  One measurement, based on the Arrhenius definition of acidity, is [[pH]], which is a measurement of the hydronium ion concentration in a solution, as expressed on a negative [[logarithm]]ic scale.  Thus, solutions that have a low pH have a high hydronium ion concentration, and can be said to be more acidic.  The other measurement, based on the Brønsted–Lowry definition, is the [[acid dissociation constant]] (K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;), which measure the relative ability of a substance to act as an acid under the Brønsted–Lowry definition of an acid.  That is, substances with a higher K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; are more likely to donate hydrogen ions in chemical reactions than those with lower K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; values.

===Phase===
{{Main|Phase (matter)}}

In addition to the specific chemical properties that distinguish different chemical classifications chemicals can exist in several phases. For the most part, the chemical classifications are independent of these bulk phase classifications; however, some more exotic phases are incompatible with certain chemical properties. A ''phase'' is a set of states of a chemical system that have similar bulk structural properties, over a range of conditions, such as [[pressure]] or [[temperature]]. Physical properties, such as [[density]] and [[refractive index]] tend to fall within values characteristic of the phase. The phase of matter is defined by the ''[[phase transition]]'', which is when energy put into or taken out of the system goes into rearranging the structure of the system, instead of changing the bulk conditions.

Sometimes the distinction between phases can be continuous instead of having a discrete boundary, in this case the matter is considered to be in a [[supercritical fluid|supercritical]] state. When three states meet based on the conditions, it is known as a [[triple point]] and since this is invariant, it is a convenient way to define a set of conditions.

The most familiar examples of phases are [[solid]]s, [[liquid]]s, and [[gas]]es. Many substances exhibit multiple solid phases. For example, there are three phases of solid [[iron]] (alpha, gamma, and delta) that vary based on temperature and pressure. A principal difference between solid phases is the [[crystal structure]], or arrangement, of the atoms. Another phase commonly encountered in the study of chemistry is the ''aqueous'' phase, which is the state of substances dissolved in [[aqueous solution]] (that is, in water). Less familiar phases include [[plasma physics|plasmas]], [[Bose-Einstein condensate]]s and [[fermionic condensate]]s and the [[paramagnetism|paramagnetic]] and [[ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]] phases of [[magnet]]ic materials. While most familiar phases deal with three-dimensional systems, it is also possible to define analogs in two-dimensional systems, which has received attention for its relevance to systems in [[biology]].

===Redox===
{{Main|Redox}}

It is a concept related to the ability of atoms of various substances to lose or gain electrons. Substances that have the ability to oxidize other substances are said to be oxidative and are known as [[oxidizing agents]], oxidants or oxidizers. An oxidant removes electrons from another substance. Similarly, substances that have the ability to reduce other substances are said to be reductive and are known as [[reducing agents]], reductants, or reducers. A reductant transfers electrons to another substance, and is thus oxidized itself. And because it &quot;donates&quot; electrons it is also called an electron donor. Oxidation and reduction properly refer to a change in oxidation number—the actual transfer of electrons may never occur. Thus, oxidation is better defined as an increase in [[oxidation number]], and reduction as a decrease in oxidation number.

===Bonding===
{{Main|Chemical bond}}
[[Image:Electron orbitals.svg|right|thumb|[[Electron]] atomic and [[molecular orbital]]s]]

Atoms sticking together in molecules or crystals are said to be bonded with one another. A chemical bond may be visualized as the [[multipole]] balance between the positive charges in the nuclei and the negative charges oscillating about them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visionlearning.com/library/module_viewer.php?mid=55 visionlearning: Chemical Bonding by Anthony Carpi, Ph]&lt;/ref&gt; More than simple attraction and repulsion, the energies and distributions characterize the availability of an electron to bond to another atom.

A [[chemical bond]] can be a [[covalent bond]], an [[ionic bond]], a [[hydrogen bond]] or just because of [[Van der Waals force]]. Each of these kind of bond is ascribed to some potential. These potentials create the [[chemical interaction|interaction]]s which hold [[atom]]s together in [[molecule]]s or [[crystal]]s. In many simple compounds, [[Valence Bond Theory]], the Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion model ([[VSEPR]]), and the concept of [[oxidation number]] can be used to explain molecular structure and composition. Similarly, theories from [[classical physics]] can be used to predict many ionic structures. With more complicated compounds, such as [[complex (chemistry)|metal complexes]], valence bond theory is less applicable and alternative approaches, such as the [[molecular orbital]] theory, are generally used. See diagram on electronic orbitals.

===Reaction===
{{Main|Chemical reaction}}

When a chemical substance is transformed as a result of its interaction with another or energy, a chemical reaction is said to have occurred. ''Chemical reaction'' is therefore a concept related to the 'reaction' of a substance when it comes in close contact with another, whether as a mixture or a [[solution]]; exposure to some form of energy, or both. It results in some energy exchange between the constituents of the reaction as well with the system environment which may be a designed vessels which are often [[laboratory glassware]]. Chemical reactions can result in the formation or [[dissociation (chemistry)|dissociation]] of molecules, that is, molecules breaking apart to form two or more smaller molecules, or rearrangement of [[atom]]s within or across molecules. Chemical reactions usually involve the making or breaking of [[chemical bond]]s. [[Redox|Oxidation, reduction]], [[dissociation (chemistry)|dissociation]], acid-base [[neutralization (chemistry)|neutralization]] and molecular [[rearrangement reaction|rearrangement]] are some of the commonly used kinds of chemical reactions.

A chemical reaction can be symbolically depicted through a [[chemical equation]]. While in a non-nuclear chemical reaction the number and kind of atoms on both sides of the equation are equal, for a nuclear reaction this holds true only for the nuclear particles viz. protons and neutrons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://goldbook.iupac.org/C01034.html Chemical Reaction Equation]- IUPAC Goldbook&lt;/ref&gt;

The sequence of steps in which the reorganization of chemical bonds may be taking place in the course of a chemical reaction is called its [[Reaction mechanism|mechanism]]. A chemical reaction can be envisioned to take place in a number of steps, each of which may have a different speed. Many [[reaction intermediates]] with variable stability can thus be envisaged during the course of a reaction. Reaction mechanisms are proposed to explain the [[chemical kinetics|kinetics]] and the relative product mix of a reaction. Many [[chemists|physical chemists]] specialize in exploring and proposing the mechanisms of various chemical reactions. Several empirical rules, like the [[Woodward-Hoffmann rules]] often come handy while proposing a mechanism for a chemical reaction.

According to the [[IUPAC]] gold book a chemical reaction is a process that results in the interconversion of chemical species&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gold Book]] [http://goldbook.iupac.org/C01033.html Chemical Reaction] IUPAC Goldbook&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, a chemical reaction may be an [[elementary reaction]] or a [[stepwise reaction]]. An additional caveat is made, in that this definition includes cases where the [[conformer|interconversion of conformers]] is experimentally observable. Such detectable chemical reactions normally involve sets of molecular entities as indicated by this definition, but it is often conceptually convenient to use the term also for changes involving single molecular entities (i.e. 'microscopic chemical events').

===Equilibrium===
{{Main|Chemical equilibrium}}

Although the concept of [[Chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]] is widely used across sciences, in the context of chemistry, it arises whenever a number of different states of the chemical composition are possible. For example, in a mixture of several chemical compounds that can react with one another, or when a substance can be present in more than one kind of phase. A system of chemical substances at equilibrium even though having an unchanging composition is most often not [[static equilibrium|static]]; molecules of the substances continue to react with one another thus giving rise to a [[dynamic equilibrium]]. Thus the concept describes the state in which the parameters such as chemical composition remain unchanged over time. Chemicals present in biological systems are invariably not at equilibrium; rather they are far from equilibrium.

===Energy===
{{Main|Energy}}

In the context of chemistry, energy is an attribute of a substance as a consequence of its [[atomic structure|atomic]], [[molecular structure|molecular]] or aggregate [[chemical structure|structure]]. Since a chemical transformation is accompanied by a change in one or more of these kinds of structure, it is invariably accompanied by an [[endothermic reaction|increase]] or [[exothermic reaction|decrease]] of [[energy]] of the substances involved. Some energy is transferred between the surroundings and the reactants of the reaction in the form of [[heat]] or [[photochemistry|light]]; thus the products of a reaction may have more or less energy than the reactants. A reaction is said to be [[exergonic reaction|exergonic]] if the final state is lower on the energy scale than the initial state; in the case of [[endergonic reaction]]s the situation is the reverse. A reaction is said to be [[exothermic reaction|exothermic]] if the reaction releases heat to the surroundings; in the case of [[endothermic reaction]]s, the reaction absorbs heat from the surroundings.

Chemical reactions are invariably not possible unless the reactants surmount an energy barrier known as the [[activation energy]]. The ''speed'' of a chemical reaction (at given temperature T) is related to the activation energy E, by the Boltzmann's population factor &lt;math&gt;e^{-E/kT} &lt;/math&gt; - that is the probability of molecule to have energy greater than or equal to E at the given temperature T. This exponential dependence of a reaction rate on temperature is known as the [[Arrhenius equation]].
The activation energy necessary for a chemical reaction can be in the form of heat, light, [[electricity]] or mechanical [[force]] in the form of [[ultrasound]].&lt;ref&gt;Reilly, Michael. (2007).
[http://www.newscientisttech.com/article/dn11427 Mechanical force induces chemical reaction], NewScientist.com news service, Reilly {{Dead link|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A related concept [[thermodynamic free energy|free energy]], which also incorporates entropy considerations, is a very useful means for predicting the feasibility of a reaction and determining the state of equilibrium of a chemical reaction, in [[chemical thermodynamics]]. A reaction is feasible only if the total change in the [[Gibbs free energy]] is negative, &lt;math&gt; \Delta G \le 0 \,&lt;/math&gt;; if it is equal to zero the chemical reaction is said to be at [[chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]].

There exist only limited possible states of energy for electrons, atoms and molecules. These are determined by the rules of [[quantum mechanics]], which require [[quantization (physics)|quantization]] of energy of a bound system. The atoms/molecules in a higher energy state are said to be excited. The molecules/atoms of substance in an excited energy state are often much more reactive; that is, more amenable to chemical reactions.

The phase of a substance is invariably determined by its energy and the energy of its surroundings. When the intermolecular forces of a substance are such that the energy of the surroundings is not sufficient to overcome them, it occurs in a more ordered phase like liquid or solid as is the case with water (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O); a liquid at room temperature because its molecules are bound by [[hydrogen bonds]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chem4kids.com/files/matter_changes.html Changing States of Matter] - Chemforkids.com&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas [[hydrogen sulfide]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S) is a gas at room temperature and standard pressure, as its molecules are bound by weaker [[dipole-dipole interaction]]s.

The transfer of energy from one chemical substance to another depends on the ''size'' of energy [[quanta]] emitted from one substance. However, heat energy is often transferred more easily from almost any substance to another because the [[phonons]] responsible for vibrational and rotational energy levels in a substance have much less energy than [[photons]] invoked for the electronic energy transfer. Thus, because vibrational and rotational energy levels are more closely spaced than electronic energy levels, heat is more easily transferred between substances relative to light or other forms of electronic energy. For example, ultraviolet electromagnetic radiation is not transferred with as much efficacy from one substance to another as thermal or electrical energy.

The existence of characteristic energy levels for different [[chemical substance]]s is useful for their identification by the analysis of [[spectral lines]]. Different kinds of spectra are often used in chemical [[spectroscopy]], e.g. [[infrared spectroscopy|IR]], [[microwave spectroscopy|microwave]], [[NMR]], [[electron spin resonance|ESR]], etc. Spectroscopy is also used to identify the composition of remote objects - like stars and distant galaxies - by analyzing their radiation spectra.
[[Image:Emission spectrum-Fe.svg|none|frame|Emission spectrum of [[iron]]]]

The term [[Energy#Chemical energy|chemical energy]] is often used to indicate the potential of a chemical substance to undergo a transformation through a [[chemical reaction]] or to transform other chemical substances.

===Chemical laws===
{{Main|Chemical law}}

Chemical reactions are governed by certain laws, which have become fundamental concepts in chemistry. Some of them are:
&lt;div style=&quot;-moz-column-count:2; column-count:2;&quot;&gt;
* [[Avogadro's law]]
* [[Beer-Lambert law]]
* [[Boyle's law]] (1662, relating pressure and volume)
* [[Charles's law]] (1787, relating volume and temperature)
* [[Fick's law of diffusion]]
* [[Gay-Lussac's law]] (1809, relating pressure and temperature)
* [[Le Chatelier's Principle]]
* [[Henry's law]]
* [[Hess's Law]]
* [[Conservation of energy|Law of conservation of energy]] leads to the important concepts of [[Chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]], [[thermodynamics]], and [[chemical kinetics|kinetics]].
* [[Law of conservation of mass]], according to the modern physics it is actually [[energy]] that is conserved, and that energy and mass are [[Mass-energy equivalence|related]]; a concept which becomes important in [[nuclear chemistry]].
* [[Law of definite composition]], although in many systems (notably biomacromolecules and minerals) the ratios tend to require large numbers, and are frequently represented as a fraction.
* [[Law of multiple proportions]]
* [[Raoult's Law]]
&lt;/div&gt;

==Subdisciplines==
Chemistry is typically divided into several major sub-disciplines. There are also several main cross-disciplinary and more specialized fields of chemistry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=A1ARTA0001555 The Canadian Encyclopedia: Chemistry Subdisciplines]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Analytical chemistry]] is the analysis of material samples to gain an understanding of their [[chemical composition]] and [[Chemical structure|structure]]. Analytical chemistry incorporates standardized experimental methods in chemistry. These methods may be used in all subdisciplines of chemistry, excluding purely theoretical chemistry.

* [[Biochemistry]] is the study of the [[chemical compound|chemicals]], [[chemical reaction]]s and [[chemical interaction]]s that take place in living [[organism]]s. Biochemistry and organic chemistry are closely related, as in [[medicinal chemistry]] or [[neurochemistry]]. Biochemistry is also associated with [[molecular biology]] and [[genetics]].

* [[Inorganic chemistry]] is the study of the properties and reactions of inorganic compounds. The distinction between organic and inorganic disciplines is not absolute and there is much overlap, most importantly in the sub-discipline of [[organometallic chemistry]].

* [[Materials science|Materials chemistry]] is the preparation, characterization, and understanding of substances with a useful function. The field is a new breadth of study in graduate programs, and it integrates elements from all classical areas of chemistry with a focus on fundamental issues that are unique to materials. Primary systems of study include the chemistry of condensed phases (solids, liquids, [[polymers]]) and [[interface (chemistry)|interfaces]] between different phases.

* [[Neurochemistry]] is the study of neurochemicals; including transmitters, peptides, proteins, lipids, sugars, and nucleic acids; their interactions, and the roles they play in forming, maintaining, and modifying the nervous system.

* [[Nuclear chemistry]] is the study of how subatomic particles come together and make nuclei. Modern [[Nuclear transmutation|Transmutation]] is a large component of nuclear chemistry, and the [[table of nuclides]] is an important result and tool for this field.

* [[Organic chemistry]] is the study of the structure, properties, composition, mechanisms, and [[chemical reaction|reactions]] of [[organic compound]]s. An organic compound is defined as any compound based on a carbon skeleton.

* [[Physical chemistry]] is the study of the physical and fundamental basis of chemical systems and processes. In particular, the energetics and dynamics of such systems and processes are of interest to physical chemists. Important areas of study include [[chemical thermodynamics]], [[chemical kinetics]], [[electrochemistry]], [[statistical mechanics]], [[spectroscopy]], and more recently, [[astrochemistry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| author = Herbst, Eric | title = Chemistry of Star-Forming Regions | journal = Journal of Physical Chemistry A | date = May 12, 2005 | volume = 109 | pages = 4017–4029 | issue = 18 | doi = 10.1021/jp050461c | pmid = 16833724}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Physical chemistry has large overlap with [[molecular physics]]. Physical chemistry involves the use of [[calculus|infinitesimal calculus]] in deriving equations. It is usually associated with [[quantum chemistry]] and theoretical chemistry. Physical chemistry is a distinct discipline from [[chemical physics]], but again, there is very strong overlap.

* [[Theoretical chemistry]] is the study of chemistry via fundamental theoretical reasoning (usually within [[mathematics]] or [[physics]]). In particular the application of [[quantum mechanics]] to chemistry is called [[quantum chemistry]]. Since the end of the [[World War II|Second World War]], the development of computers has allowed a systematic development of [[computational chemistry]], which is the art of developing and applying [[computer program]]s for solving chemical problems. Theoretical chemistry has large overlap with (theoretical and experimental) [[condensed matter physics]] and [[molecular physics]].

Other fields include [[agrochemistry]], [[astrochemistry]] (and [[cosmochemistry]]), [[atmospheric chemistry]], [[chemical engineering]], [[chemical biology]], [[chemo-informatics]], [[electrochemistry]], [[environmental chemistry]], [[femtochemistry]], [[flavor|flavor chemistry]], [[flow chemistry]], [[geochemistry]], [[green chemistry]], [[histochemistry]], [[history of chemistry]], [[hydrogenation|hydrogenation chemistry]], [[immunochemistry]], [[marine chemistry]], [[materials science]], [[mathematical chemistry]], [[mechanochemistry]], [[medicinal chemistry]], [[molecular biology]], [[molecular mechanics]], [[nanotechnology]], [[natural product chemistry]], [[oenology]], [[organometallic chemistry]], [[petrochemistry]], [[pharmacology]], [[photochemistry]], [[physical organic chemistry]], [[phytochemistry]], [[polymer chemistry]], [[radiochemistry]], [[solid-state chemistry]], [[sonochemistry]], [[supramolecular chemistry]], [[surface chemistry]], [[synthetic chemistry]], [[thermochemistry]], and many others.

The '''cytoplasm''' is a thick liquid residing between the cell membrane holding all organelles, except for the [[cell nucleus|nucleus]]. All the contents of the cells of [[prokaryote]] organisms (which lack a [[cell nucleus]]) are contained within the cytoplasm.  Within the cells of [[eukaryote]] organisms the contents of the [[cell nucleus]] are separated from the cytoplasm, and are then called the [[nucleoplasm]].

In eukaryotic cells also, the cytoplasm contains [[organelle]]s, such as [[mitochondrion|mitochondria]], which are filled with liquid that is kept separate from the rest of the cytoplasm by [[biological membrane]]s.  It is within the cytoplasm that most cellular activities occur, such as many [[metabolic pathway]]s including [[glycolysis]], and processes such as [[cell division]]. The inner, granular mass is called the [[endoplasm]] and the outer, clear and glassy layer is called the [[cell cortex]] or the [[ectoplasm (cell biology)|ectoplasm]].

The part of the cytoplasm that is not held within organelles is called the [[cytosol]]. The cytosol is a complex mixture of [[cytoskeleton]] filaments, dissolved molecules, and water that fills much of the volume of a cell. The cytosol is a [[gel]], with a network of fibers dispersed through water. Due to this network of pores and high concentrations of dissolved [[macromolecule]]s, such as [[protein]]s, an effect called [[macromolecular crowding]] occurs and the cytosol does not act as an [[ideal solution]]. This crowding effect alters how the components of the cytosol interact with each other.

Movement of calcium ions in and out of the cytoplasm is thought to be a signaling activity for metabolic processes.&lt;ref&gt;C. Michael Hogan. 2010.

== Constituents ==

The cytoplasm has three major elements; the cytosol, organelles and inclusions.

=== Cytosol ===
{{main|Cytosol}}
The cytosol is the portion not within membrane-bound organelles. The cytosol is a translucent fluid in which the plasmic elements are suspended. Cytosol makes up about 70% of the cell volume and is composed of water, salts and organic molecules.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sun.menloschool.org/~birchler/cells/animals/cytoplasm/ Cytoplasm Composition]&lt;/ref&gt; The cytoplasm also contains the [[protein filament]]s that make up the [[cytoskeleton]], as well as soluble [[proteins]] and small structures such as [[ribosome]]s, [[proteasome]]s, and the mysterious [[Vault (organelle)|vault complexes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=van Zon A, Mossink MH, Scheper RJ, Sonneveld P, Wiemer EA |title=The vault complex |journal=Cell. Mol. Life Sci. |volume=60 |issue=9 |pages=1828–37 |year=2003 |month=September |pmid=14523546 |doi=10.1007/s00018-003-3030-y}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inner, granular and more fluid portion of the cytoplasm is referred to as endoplasm.
[[Image:Localisations02eng.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Proteins in different [[cellular compartment]]s and structures tagged with [[green fluorescent protein]].]]

=== Organelles ===
{{main|Organelles}}
Organelles are membrane-bound &quot;organs&quot; inside the cell that have specific functions. Some major organelles that are suspended in the cytosol are the [[mitochondria]], the [[endoplasmic reticulum]], the [[Golgi apparatus]], [[vacuoles]], [[lysosomes]], and in plant cells [[chloroplast]]s.

=== Cytoplasmic inclusions ===
{{main|Cytoplasmic inclusion}}
The inclusions are small particles of insoluble substances suspended in the cytosol. A huge range of inclusions exist in different cell types, and range from crystals of [[calcium oxalate]] or [[silicon dioxide]] in plants,&lt;ref name=Prychid1999&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Prychid, Christina J.; Rudall, Paula J. | year = 1999 | title = Calcium Oxalate Crystals in Monocotyledons: A Review of their Structure and Systematics | journal = Annals of Botany | volume = 84 | issue = 6 | pages = 725 | doi = 10.1006/anbo.1999.0975 | url = http://aob.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/84/6/725}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Prychid2003&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Prychid, C.

'''Christ''' is the [[English language|English]] term for the [[Greek (language)|Greek]] {{Polytonic|Χριστός}} (''Khristós'') meaning &quot;[[anointing|the anointed one]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Christ |title=Etymology Online: '&amp;#39;Christ'&amp;#39; |publisher=Etymonline.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a translation of the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] {{Hebrew|מָשִׁיחַ}} (''{{unicode|Māšîaḥ}}''), usually [[transliteration|transliterated]] into [[English language|English]] as ''[[Messiah]]'' or [[Mashiach]]. In popular modern usage—even within secular circles—the term usually refers explicitly to [[Jesus|Jesus of Nazareth]].

The word is used as a [[title]], hence its common reciprocal use ''Christ Jesus'', meaning ''&quot;The Messiah Jesus&quot;''. Followers of Jesus became known as [[Christians]] because they believe out of Christian doctrine that Jesus is the Christ, or Christos, or Christian Messiah, [[prophecy|prophesied]] in the [[Old Testament]] - therefore they often call him [[Jesus Christ]], meaning Jesus ''is the'' Christos. 

Since the [[Apostolic Age]], Jesus was never accepted as the [[Jewish Messiah claimants|Jewish Messiah]].&lt;ref&gt;''The nine questions people ask about Judaism'' by Dennis Prager, Joseph Telushkin 1981 ISBN 0671425935 page 87&lt;/ref&gt; Most Christians, however, still wait for the [[Second Coming]] of Christ when they believe he will fulfill the major rest of the Christian [[Messianic prophecy]]. The area of Christian [[theology]] focusing on the [[Person of Christ|identity]], life, teachings and works of Jesus, is known as [[Christology]].
 
== Etymology and origins ==
{{See|Chrism|Christian (word)}}
{{see also|Holy Name of Jesus}}

The word ''Christ'' (or similar spellings) appears in English and most [[Europe]]an [[languages]], owing to the [[Greek language|Greek]] usage of ''Christós'' (transcribed in Latin as ''Christus'') in the [[New Testament]] as a [[description]] for [[Jesus]]. Christ has now become a name, one part of the name &quot;Jesus Christ&quot;, but originally
it was a title (the Messiah) and not a name.&lt;ref&gt;''Jesus God and Man'' by Wolfhart Pannenberg 1968 ISBN 0664244688 pages 30-31&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Septuagint]] version of the [[Hebrew Bible]] (written over a century before the time of Jesus), the word Christ was used to translate into Greek the [[Hebrew (language)|Hebrew]] ''mashiach'' (messiah), meaning &quot;anointed.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Jesus of history, Christ of faith'' by Thomas Zanzig 2000 ISBN 0884895300 page 314&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nfcnqq&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=messiah |title=Etymology Online: '&amp;#39;messiah'&amp;#39; |publisher=Etymonline.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Khristós'' in classical [[Ancient Greek language|Greek usage]] could mean ''covered in oil'', or anointed, and is thus a literal translation of [[messiah]].  

The spelling ''Christ''  ([[Greek language|Greek]] [[Genitive]]: {{polytonic|τοῦ Χριστοῦ}}, ''toú Christoú,''; [[Nominative]]: {{polytonic|ὁ Χριστὸς}}, ''ho Christós'') in [[English language|English]] was [[standardization|standardized]] in the 18th [[century]], when, in the spirit of [[age of Enlightenment|the Enlightenment]], the spelling of certain words was changed to fit their [[Greek language|Greek]] or [[Latin]] origins. Prior to this, in [[Old English|Old]] and [[Middle English]], the word was usually spelled ''Crist'' the ''i'' being pronounced either as {{IPA-en|iː|}}, preserved in the names of churches such as [[St Katherine Cree]], or as a short {{IPA-en|ɪ|}}, preserved in the modern pronunciation of [[Christmas]]). The spelling &quot;Christ&quot; is attested from the 14th century.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary, s.v. &quot;Christ&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern usage, even within secular terminology, Christ usually refers to [[Jesus]], building on the centuries old tradition of such use. Since the [[Apostolic Age]], the use of the definite article before the word Christ and its development into a proper name signifies its identification with Jesus as the promised Jewish messiah.&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Origin of the Name of Jesus Christ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sargis Pitsak.jpg|thumb|left|130px|First page of [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]], by [[Sargis Pitsak]] (14th century): &quot;''The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God''&quot;.]]

At the time of Jesus, there was no single, coherent form or order within Judaism, and significant political, social and religious differences existed among the Jews.&lt;ref name=Ekstrand147 &gt;''Christianity'' by Donald W. Ekstrand 2008 ISBN 1604779292 pages 147-150&lt;/ref&gt; However, for centuries the Jews had used the term &quot;the Anointed&quot; to refer to their expected deliverer.&lt;ref name= CathencChrist &gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374x.htm Catholic encyclopedia on Christ]&lt;/ref&gt; A large number of Old Testament passages were regarded as [[Messiah|messianic]] by the Jews, many more than are commonly considered messianic by Christians, and various groups of Jews assigned varying degrees of significance to them.&lt;ref name=Ekstrand147 /&gt;

The Greek word Messias appears only twice in the [[Old Testament]] of the promised prince (Daniel 9:26; Psalm 2:2); yet, when a name was wanted for the promised one, who was to be at once King and Savior, this title was used.&lt;ref name= CathencMessiah &gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10212c.htm Catholic encyclopedia on Messiah]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kasper  &gt;''Jesus the Christ'' by Walter Kasper 1976 ISBN 080912081X pages 104-105&lt;/ref&gt; The [[New Testament]] states that the Messiah, long awaited, had come and describes this savior as ''The Christ.'' In {{bibleref|Matt|16:16}} Apostle Peter, in what has become a famous proclamation of faith among Christians since the first century, said, &quot;You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.&quot;&lt;ref name=Ekstrand147 /&gt;

The opening words in the [[Gospel of Mark]] {{bibleverse-nb||Mark|1:1|KJV}}, namely &quot;The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God&quot; also identify Jesus as both Christ and the Son of God. The divinity being again re-affirmed in {{bibleverse||Mark|1:11|KJV}}.&lt;ref&gt;''Lord Jesus Christ: Devotion to Jesus in Earliest Christianity'' by Larry W. Hurtado 2005 ISBN 0802831672 page 288&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter Mark never applies Christ to Jesus as a name. {{bibleverse||Matthew|1:1|KJV}} uses Christ as a name and {{bibleverse||Matthew|1:16|KJV}} explains it again with: &quot;Jesus, who is called Christ&quot;. In the [[Gospel of John]], Jesus refers to himself as the Son of God far more frequently than in the [[Synoptic Gospel]]s.&lt;ref&gt;''Lord Jesus Christ: Devotion to Jesus in Earliest Christianity'' by Larry W. Hurtado 2005 ISBN 0802831672 pages 363-363&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of the definite article before the word Christ and its gradual development into a proper name show the Christians identified the bearer with the promised Messiah of the Jews who fulfilled all the Messianic predictions in a fuller and a higher sense than had been given them by the Rabbis.&lt;ref name= CathencChrist /&gt; In the [[New Testament]] e.g. Matthew 1:1, 1:18; Mark 1:1; John 1:17; 17:3; 9:22; Mark 9:40; Luke 2:11; 22:2, the word Christ is preceded by Jesus.&lt;ref name= CathencChrist /&gt;

{{Christology}}
While the Gospels of Mark and Matthew begin by calling Jesus both Christ and Son of God, these are two distinct attributions. They develop in the New Testament along separate paths and have distinct theological implications. The development of both titles involves &quot;the precursor&quot;, [[John the Baptist]]. At the time in Judaea the Jews had been awaiting the &quot;messiah&quot;. And many people were wondering who it would be. When John the Baptist appeared and began preaching, he attracted disciples who assumed he would be announced as the Messiah, or &quot;the one&quot; they had been awaiting. But the title Son of God was not attributed to John.

In the Gospel narrative that describe the life of Jesus, the first instance for him being called the Son of God appears during [[Baptism of Jesus|his Baptism]] by John the Baptist. In the narrative, a voice from heaven calls Jesus the Son. In [[Messengers from John the Baptist]] episode, in {{bibleverse||Matthew|11:2-6|NIV}} and {{bibleverse||Luke|7:18-23|NIV}}.&lt;ref&gt;''The Gospel of Matthew'' by Rudolf Schnackenburg 2002 ISBN 0802844383 page 104&lt;/ref&gt; when [[John the Baptist]] is in prison two of his disciples go and ask Jesus a question on his behalf: &quot;Are you the one to come after me or shall we wait for another?&quot; &lt;ref&gt;''Mercer dictionary of the Bible'' by Watson E. Mills, Roger Aubrey Bullard 1998 ISBN 0865543739 page 459&lt;/ref&gt; indicating that the identity of Jesus as Christ was not yet certain at that time.

In {{bibleverse||John|11:27|NIV}} Martha tells Jesus &quot;you are the Christ, the Son of God, who is coming into the world&quot;, signifying that both titles were generally accepted (yet considered distinct) among the followers of Jesus before the [[Raising of Lazarus]].&lt;ref&gt;''Christianity'' by Donald W. Ekstrand 2008 ISBN 1604779292 page 81&lt;/ref&gt;

Explicit claims of Jesus being the Messiah are found in the Canonical Gospels in the confession of Peter in Matthew 16 and the words of Jesus before his judges in the [[Sanhedrin trial of Jesus]].&lt;ref name= CathencMessiah /&gt; These incidents involve, of course, far more than a mere claim to the Messiahship; taken in their setting, they constitute a claim to be the Son of God.&lt;ref name= CathencMessiah /&gt; 

In the trial of Jesus before the Sanhedrin and Pilate, it might appear from the narratives of Matthew and Luke that Jesus at first refused a direct reply to the high priest's question: &quot;Art thou the Christ?&quot; Although his answer is given merely as ''su eipas'' (thou hast said it), the Gospel of Mark states the answer as ''ego eimi'' (I am) and there are instances from Jewish literature in which the expression, &quot;thou hast said it&quot;, is equivalent to &quot;you are right&quot;.&lt;ref name= CathencMessiah /&gt; The Messianic claim was less significant than the claim to Divinity which caused the high priest the horrified accusation of blasphemy and the subsequent calls for the death sentence. Before Pilate on the other hand it was merely the assertion of his royal dignity which gave ground for his condemnation.&lt;ref name= CathencMessiah /&gt;

In the [[Pauline Epistles]] the word Christ is so closely associated with Jesus that
it is apparent that for the early Christians there is no need to claim that Jesus is Christ, for that is considered widely accepted among them. Hence Paul can use the term ''Christos'' with no confusion as to who it refers to, and as in 
{{bibleverse||1Corinthians|4:15|NIV}} and {{bibleverse||Romans|12:5|NIV}} he can use expressions such as &quot;in Christ&quot; to refer to the followers of Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;''Lord Jesus Christ: Devotion to Jesus in Earliest Christianity'' by Larry W. Hurtado 2005 ISBN 0802831672 page 99&lt;/ref&gt; St. Paul proclaims him as the new Adam, who restores through obedience what Adam lost through disobedience.&lt;ref name=Rahner731 &gt;''Encyclopedia of theology: a concise Sacramentum mundi'' by [[Karl Rahner]] 2004 ISBN 0860120066 pp 730-739&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also implicit claims to being the Christ in the words and actions of Jesus.&lt;ref name= CathencMessiah /&gt; Episodes in the life of Jesus and statements about what he accomplished during his three-year public ministry are found throughout the [[New Testament]]. Core biblical teachings about the person of Jesus Christ may be summarized that Jesus Christ was and forever is fully God (divine) and, in time and history, became fully human, uniting his human nature and his divine nature in one divine person.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grudem&quot;&gt;Grudem, Wayne A.

==Pre-existence, Incarnation and Nativity==
{{see also|Pre-existence of Christ|Logos (Christianity)|Nativity of Jesus}}
[[File:Sainte-marie Madeleine2.jpg|thumb|180px|The [[Anointing of Jesus]], c. 1450.]]
There are distinct, and differing, views among Christians regarding the existence of Christ before his conception. A key passage in the New Testament is {{bibleverse||John|1:1-18|NIV}} where John 1:17 specifically mentions that &quot;grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.&quot; Those who believe in the [[Trinity]], consider Christ a pre-existent divine [[Hypostatic union|hypostasis]] called the [[Logos]] or the [[Logos (Christianity)|Word]]. Other, non-Trinitarian views, question the aspect of personal pre-existence or question the aspect of divinity, or both.

The concept of Christ as [[Logos (Christianity)|Logos]] derives from {{bibleverse||John|1:1|NIV}}: &quot;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.&quot; In the original Greek, ''[[Logos]]'' (λόγος) is used for &quot;Word,&quot; and is often used untranslated. In the [[Christology]] of the Logos, Christ is viewed as the Incarnation of the &quot;Divine Logos&quot;, i.e. The Word.&lt;ref&gt;''A theology primer'' by Robert C. Neville 1991 ISBN 0791408493 page 141&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Saint Paul]] viewed the [[Nativity of Jesus]] as an event of cosmic significance which by the Incarnation of Christ brought forth a new world of harmony to undo the damage caused by the fall of the first man, [[Adam and Eve|Adam]]. St. Paul's [[eschatology|eschatological]] view of the birth of Jesus as the Christ counter-positions him as ushering in the new world of order that leads to salvation, unlike Adam, whose disobedience caused a rift with God.&lt;ref name=Pannenberg &gt;''Systematic Theology, Volume 2'' by Wolfhart Pannenberg 2004 0567084663 ISBN pages 297-303&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Daille &gt;''An exposition of the epistle of Saint Paul to the Philippians'' by Jean Daille 1995 ISBN 0802825117 pages 194-195&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2nd century, with his theory of &quot;recapitulation&quot;, Saint [[Irenaeus]] connected &quot;Christ the Creator&quot; with &quot;Christ the Savior&quot;, relying on {{bibleverse||Ephesians|1:10|NIV}} (&quot;when the times reach their fulfillment — to bring unity to all things in heaven and on earth under Christ&quot;) to gather together and ''wrap up'' the cycle of the Nativity and Resurrection of Christ.&lt;ref&gt;''Christ at the Center: The Early Christian Era'' by Lisa D.

{{cquote2|&quot;''She will bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins''.&quot; — In {{bibleverse||Matthew|1:21|ESV}} the name Jesus was selected by Divine direction.&lt;ref&gt;''Bible explorer's guide'' by John Phillips 2002 ISBN 0825434831 page 147&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In {{bibleverse||Colossians|1:15-16|ESV}} Apostle Paul viewed the [[Nativity of Jesus]] as an event of cosmic significance which changed the nature of the world by paving the way for salvation.&lt;ref&gt;The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia'' by Geoffrey W. Bromiley 1988 ISBN 0802837859 page&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''An introductory dictionary of theology and religious studies'' by Orlando O. Espín, James B. Nickoloff 2007 ISBN 0814658563 page 238&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Mercer dictionary of the Bible'' by Watson E. Mills, Roger Aubrey Bullard 1998 ISBN 0865543739 page 712&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Basic Theology:'' by Charles Caldwell Ryrie 1999 ISBN 0802427340 page 275&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In the 2nd century, [[Church Father]] Saint [[Irenaeus]] expressed his views of salvation as in terms of the  imitation of Christ and his theory of &quot;recapitulation&quot;. For Irenaeus the imitation of Christ is based on God's plan of salvation, which involved Christ as the second Adam. He viewed the Incarnation as the way in which Christ repaired the damage done by Adam's disobedience. For Irenaeus, salvation was achieved by Christ restoring humanity to the image of God, and he saw the Christian imitation of Christ as a key component on the path to salvation.&lt;ref name=McKim &gt;''Theological turning points'' by Donald K. McKim 1989 ISBN 080420702X page 80&lt;/ref&gt; For Irenaeus Christ succeeded on every point on which Adam failed.&lt;ref&gt;''The Christian theology reader'' by Alister E. McGrath 2006 ISBN 140515358X page&lt;/ref&gt; Irenaeus drew a number of parallels, e.g. just as in the fall of Adam resulted from the fruit of a tree, Irenaeus saw redemption and salvation as the fruit of another tree: the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|cross of crucifixion]].&lt;ref name=McKim /&gt;

Following in the Pauline tradition, in the 5th century [[Saint Augustine]] viewed Christ as the mediator between God and man and as the conqueror over sin. He viewed Christ as the cause and reason for the reconciliation of man with God after the fall of Adam, and he saw in Christ the path to Christian salvation.&lt;ref&gt;''Theological turning points: major issues in Christian thought'' by Donald K. McKim 1989 ISBN 080420702X pages 85-86&lt;/ref&gt; Augustine believed that salvation is available to those who are worthy of it, through faith in Christ.&lt;ref&gt;''An introduction to the theology of religions'' by Veli-Matti Kärkkäinen 2003 ISBN 083082572X page 66&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 13th century [[Saint Thomas Aquinas]] aimed to recapture the teachings of the [[Church Fathers]] on the role of the [[Holy Trinity]] in the economy of salvation.&lt;ref&gt;''The Trinitarian Theology of Saint Thomas Aquinas'' by Gilles Emery, Francesca Aran Murphy 2010 ISBN 0199582211 pages 13-15&lt;/ref&gt; In Aquinas' view angels and humans were created for salvation from the very beginning.&lt;ref&gt;''Thomas Aquinas' trinitarian theology: a study in theological method'' by Timothy Lee Smith ISBN pages 17-19&lt;/ref&gt; For Acquinas the passion of Christ poured out the grace of salvation and all its virtues unto humanity.&lt;ref&gt;''The encyclopedia of Christianity, Volume 5'' by Erwin Fahlbusch 2008 ISBN 080282417X page 490&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Martin Luther]] distinguished between the history of the salvation between the Old and the New Testament, and saw a new dimension to salvation with the arrival of Christ.&lt;ref&gt;''Systematic Theology, Volume 3'' Wolfhart Pannenberg 2004 ISBN 0567080684 page 84&lt;/ref&gt;

The focus on human history was an important element of the biblically grounded 16th century theology of [[John Calvin]]. Calvin considered the coming of Christ as the key turning point in human history. He viewed Christ as &quot;the one through whom salvation began&quot; and he saw the completion of Christ's plan of salvation as his death and [[Resurrection of Jesus|Resurrection]].&lt;ref name=McKim161 &gt;''Theological turning points'' by Donald K. McKim 1989 ISBN 080420702X page 161&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Simple Labarum2.svg|thumb|80px|The ''[[Chi-Rho]]''.]]
The use of &quot;Χ,&quot; derived from Chi, the [[Greek alphabet]] initial, as an abbreviation for Christ (most commonly in the abbreviation &quot;[[Χmas]]&quot;) is often misinterpreted as a modern secularization of the term. Thus understood, the centuries-old [[English Language|English]] word Χmas, is actually a shortened form of CHmas, which is, itself, a shortened form for [[Christmas]]. [[Christian]]s are sometimes referred to as &quot;Xians,&quot; with the 'X' replacing 'Christ.&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A very early Christogram is the ''[[Chi Rho]]'' symbol formed by superimposing the first two Greek letters in Christ ( [[Greek language|Greek]] : &quot;Χριστός&quot; ), [[chi (letter)|chi]] = ch and [[rho (letter)|rho]] = r, to produce &lt;big&gt;☧&lt;/big&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;''Symbols of the Christian faith'' by Alva William Steffler 2002 ISBN 0802846769 page 66&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Central Europe''' is a region of the [[Europe]]an [[continent]] lying between the variously defined areas of [[Eastern Europe|Eastern]] and [[Western Europe]]. The term and widespread interest in the region itself came back into fashion&lt;ref name=Economist&gt;{{Citation|title=Central Europe — The future of the Visegrad group|url=http://www.economist.com/displayStory.cfm?Story_ID=E1_PRSTNSV|work=[[The Economist]]|date=2005-04-14|accessdate=2009-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; after the end of the [[Cold War]], which, along with the [[Iron Curtain]], had divided [[Europe]] politically into East and West, splitting Europe in half.

The concept of Central Europe, and that of a common [[Cultural identity|identity]], is somewhat elusive.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Agh|1998|pages=2–8}}

== Current views on Central Europe ==
Rather than a physical entity, Central Europe is a concept of shared history which contrasts with that of the surrounding regions. The issue how to name and define the Central European region is subject to debates. Very often, the definition depends on nationality and historical perspective of its author.

Main propositions, gathered by [[Jerzy Kłoczowski]], include:&lt;ref&gt;[[Jerzy Kłoczowski]], Actualité des grandes traditions de la cohabitation et du dialogue des cultures en Europe du Centre-Est, in: L'héritage historique de la Res Publica de Plusieurs Nations, Lublin 2004, pp. 29–30&lt;/ref&gt;
* West-Central and [[East-Central Europe]] – this conception, presented in 1950,&lt;ref&gt;[[Oskar Halecki]], The Limits and Divisions of European History, Sheed &amp; Ward: London and New York 1950, chapter VII&lt;/ref&gt; distinguished two regions in Central Europe: German West-Centre, with imperial tradition of the ''[[Reich]]'', and the East-Centre covered by variety of nations ''from [[Finland]] to [[Greece]]'', placed between great empires of [[Scandinavia]], [[Germany]], [[Italy]] and the [[Soviet Union]]
* Central Europe as the area of cultural heritage of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] – [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]], [[Belarus]]ian and [[Lithuania]]n historians, in cooperation (since 1990) with [[Poland|Polish]] historians, insist on the importance of the notion
* Central Europe as a region connected to the [[western world|Western civilisation]] for a very long time, including countries like the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], [[Holy Roman Empire]], later [[German Empire]] and the [[Habsburg Monarchy]], the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] and [[Bohemia]]. Central Europe understood in this way borders on [[Russia]] and the [[South-Eastern Europe]], but the exact frontier of the region is difficult to determine.
* Central Europe as the area of cultural heritage of the [[Habsburg Empire]] – a concept which is popular in the region of [[Danube River]]
* A concept underlining the links connecting [[Ukraine]] and [[Belarus]] with [[Russia]] and treating the [[Russian Empire]] together with the whole [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] population as one entity – this position is taken by the [[Russia]]n historiography
* A concept putting an accent on the links with the West, especially from the 19th century and the grand period of liberation and formation of Nation-states – this idea is represented by in the [[South-Eastern Europe|South-Eastern]] states, which prefer the enlarged concept of the “East Centre” expressing their links with the [[Western culture]]

According to [[Ronald Tiersky]], the 1991 summit held in [[Visegrád]], [[Hungary]] and attended by the [[Poland|Polish]], [[Hungary|Hungarian]] and [[Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovak]] presidents was hailed at the time as a major breakthrough in Central European cooperation, but the [[Visegrád Group]] became a vehicle for coordinating Central Europe's road to the European Union, while development of closer ties within the region languished.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tiersky, p. 472&quot;&gt;[[Ronald Tiersky|Tiersky]], p. 472&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter J. Katzenstein]] described Central Europe as a way station in a Europeanization process that marks the transformation process of the [[Visegrád Group]] countries in different, though comparable ways.&lt;ref name=&quot;Peter J p. 6&quot;&gt;[[Peter J. Katzenstein|Katzenstein]], p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; According to him in Germany's contemporary public discourse  &quot;Central European identity&quot; refers to the civilizational divide between Roman Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Peter J p. 6&quot;/&gt; He says there's no precise, uncontestable way to decide whether the Baltic states, Serbia, Croatia, Slovenia, Romania, and Bulgaria are parts of Central Europe or not.&lt;ref name=&quot;Peter J p. 4&quot;&gt;[[Peter J.

[[Lonnie R. Johnson]] points out criteria to distinguish Central Europe from [[Western Europe|Western]], [[Eastern Europe|Eastern]] and [[Southeast Europe]]:&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Central Europe: enemies, neighbors, friends&quot;, by Lonnie R. Johnson, [[Oxford University Press]], 1996&lt;/ref&gt;
* one criterion for defining Central Europe is the frontiers of medieval empires and kingdoms that largely correspond to the religious frontiers between the [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] West and the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox East]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnson, p.4&quot;&gt;Johnson, p.4&lt;/ref&gt; The pagans of Central Europe were converted to [[Roman Catholicism]] while in [[Southeastern Europe|Southeastern]] and [[Eastern Europe]] they were brought in the fold of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnson, p.4&quot;/&gt;

* Multinational empires were a characteristic of Central Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnson, p. 4&quot;&gt;Johnson, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hungary]] and [[Poland]], small and medium-size states today, were empires during their early histories.&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnson, p. 4&quot;/&gt; The historical [[Kingdom of Hungary]] was until 1918 three times larger than Hungary is today,&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnson, p. 4&quot;&gt;Johnson, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; while Poland was the largest state in Europe in the sixteenth century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnson, p. 4&quot;/&gt; Both these kingdoms housed a wide variety of different peoples.&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnson, p. 4&quot;&gt;Johnson, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

* as a mode of self-perception, despite the debated nature of the concept Central Europeans generally agree on which peoples are to be excluded from this club: for example [[Serbs]], [[Bulgarians]], [[Romanians]] and [[Russians]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnson, p. 6&quot;&gt;Johnson, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

He also thinks that Central Europe is a dynamical historical concept, not a static spatial one. For example, [[Lithuania]], a fair share of [[Belarus]] and western [[Ukraine]] are in [[Eastern Europe]] today, but 250 years ago they were in Poland.&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnson, p. 4&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

The German Encyclopaedia ''Meyers grosses Taschenlexikon'' ({{lang-en|Meyers Big Pocket Encyclopedia}}), 1999, defines Central Europe as the central part of Europe with no precise borders to the East and West. The term is mostly used to denominate the territory between the [[Schelde]] to [[Vistula River|Vistula]] and from the [[Danube]] to the [[Moravian Gate]]. Usually the countries considered to be Central European are Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, in the broader sense Romania too, occasionally also the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg.

== History of the concept ==

[[File:Great Schism 1054 with former borders.png|right|thumb|200px| The [[Great Schism]] with former borders in 1054]]
As elements of unity for Western and Central Europe were considered the Roman Catholicism and Latin. Eastern Europe that remained Orthodox Christian, was the area of Byzantine cultural influence, and after the schism will develop cultural unity and protection against the Catholic and Protestant (Western) world, within the framework of Slavonic language and the Cyrillic alphabet.&lt;ref&gt;http://rediscover.manuscriptorium.com/files/rediscover/RO_Text_Catalogue_ENG_0.doc&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Before World War I ===

The concept of Central Europe was already known at the beginning of the 19th century,&lt;ref name=&quot;essex.ac.uk&quot;&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.essex.ac.uk/ecpr/events/graduateconference/barcelona/papers/681.pdf |title=&quot;Mitteleuropa&quot; is a multi-facetted concept and difficult to handle |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; but its real life began in the 20th century and immediately became an object of intensive interest. However, the very first concept mixed science, politics and economy – it was strictly connected with intensively growing German economy and its aspirations to dominate a part of European continent called ''Mitteleuropa''. The German term denoting Central Europe was so fashionable that other languages started referring to it when indicating territories from [[Rhine]] to [[Vistula]], or even [[Dnieper]], and from the [[Baltic Sea]] to the [[Balkans]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Podraza, ''Europa Środkowa jako region historyczny'', 17th Congress of Polish Historians, [[Jagiellonian University]] 2004&lt;/ref&gt; An example of that-time vision of Central Europe may be seen in J. Partsch’s book of 1903.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Franz Maria Partsch, Clementina Black, Halford John Mackinder, ''Central Europe'', New York 1903&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 January 1904 - ''Mitteleuropäischer Wirtschaftsverein'' (Central European Economic Association) was established in [[Berlin]] with economic integration of Germany and Austria–Hungary (with eventual extension to [[Switzerland]], [[Belgium]] and the [[Netherlands]]) as its main aim. Another time, the term Central Europe became connected to the German plans of political, economic and cultural domination. The “bible” of the concept was [[Friedrich Naumann]]’s book ''Mitteleuropa''&lt;ref&gt;F. Naumann, ''Mitteleuropa'', Berlin: Reimer, 1915&lt;/ref&gt; in which he called for an economic federation to be established after the war. Naumann's idea was that the federation would have at its center [[Germany]] and the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] but would also include all European nations outside the Anglo-French alliance, on one side, and Russia, on the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://science.jrank.org/pages/11015/Regions-Regionalism-Eastern-Europe-Central-versus-Eastern-Europe.html |title=Regions and Eastern Europe Regionalism - Central Versus Eastern Europe |publisher=Science.jrank.org |date= |accessdate=2010-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept failed after the German defeat in the [[World War I]] and the [[Austria–Hungary#Dissolution|dissolution of Austria–Hungary]]. The revival of the idea may be observed during the [[Nazi Germany|Hitler era]].

=== Interwar period ===
[[File:Central Europe (Geographie universelle, 1927).PNG|thumb|right|[[Interwar period|Interwar]] Central Europe, according to the French geographer Emmanuel de Martonne (1927)]]

According to [[Emmanuel de Martonne]], in 1927 the Central European countries included: Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Romania. Italy and Yugoslavia are not considered by the author to be Central European because they are located mostly outside Central Europe. The author use both Human and Physical Geographical features to define Central Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://img73.imageshack.us/img73/5269/file0039ao0.jpg ], [http://img12.imageshack.us/img12/4384/martonne1.jpg ] and [http://img98.imageshack.us/img98/1867/martonne2a.jpg]; ''Géographie universelle'' (1927), edited by [[Paul Vidal de la Blache]] and [[Lucien Gallois]])&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[interwar period]] (1918–1939) brought new geopolitical system and economic and political problems, and the concept of Central Europe took a different character. The centre of interest was moved to its eastern part – the countries that have reappeared on the map of Europe: [[Poland]], [[Hungary]] and [[Czechoslovakia]]. Central Europe ceased to be the area of German aspiration to lead or dominate and became a territory of various integration movements aiming at resolving political, economic and national problems of &quot;new&quot; states, being a way to face German and Soviet pressures. However, the conflict of interests was too big and neither [[Little Entente]] nor [[Międzymorze]] ideas succeeded.

The interwar period brought new elements to the concept of Central Europe. Before World War I, it embraced mainly German states ([[Germany]], [[Austria]]), non-German territories being an area of intended German penetration and domination - German leadership position was to be the natural result of economic dominance.&lt;ref name=&quot;essex.ac.uk&quot;/&gt; After the war, the Eastern part of Central Europe was placed at the centre of the concept. At that time the scientists took interest in the idea: the International Historical Congress in [[Brussels]] in 1923 was committed to Central Europe, and the 1933 Congress continued the discussions.
[[File:Little Entente.png|thumb|right|[[Little Entente]] defence union, ''The Versailles System and CE'', Oxford journals&lt;ref name=&quot;ehr.oxfordjournals.org&quot;&gt;{{Citation|url=http://ehr.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pdf_extract/CXXI/490/338|last1=Deak|first1=I. |title=The Versailles System and Central Europe - Deák CXXI (490): 338 - The English Historical Review |doi=10.1093/ehr/cej100 |publisher=Ehr.oxfordjournals.org|pages=338|volume=CXXI |date= |journal=The English Historical Review|accessdate=2010-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Magda Adam, in the ''Versailles System and Central Europe'', published in the ''Oxford journals'': &quot;Today we know that the bane of Central Europe was the [[Little Entente]], military alliance of Czechoslovakia, Romania and Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later Yugoslavia), created in 1921 not for Central Europe's cooperation nor to fight German expansion, but in a wrong perceived notion that a completely powerless Hungary must be kept down&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ehr.oxfordjournals.org&quot;/&gt;

The avant-garde movements of Central Europe were an essential part of modernism’s evolution, reaching its peak throughout the continent during the 1920s. The ''Sourcebook of Central European avantgards'' (Los Angeles County Museum of Art) contains primary documents of the avant-gardes in Austria, Czechoslovakia, Germany, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and Yugoslavia from 1910 to 1930.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=8958 |title=Between Worlds - The MIT Press |publisher=Mitpress.mit.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The manifestos and magazines of Western European radical art circles are well known to Western scholars and are being taught at primary universities of their kind in the western world.

=== Central Europe behind the Iron Curtain ===
Following [[World War II]], large parts of Europe that were culturally and historically Western became part of the [[Eastern bloc]]. Czech author [[Milan Kundera]] (emigrant to France) thus wrote in 1984 about the &quot;Tragedy of Central Europe&quot; in the [[New York Review of Books]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CBYQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.euroculture.upol.cz%2Fdokumenty%2Fsylaby%2FKundera_Tragedy_(18).pdf&amp;rct=j&amp;q=kundera%20tragedy%20of%20central%20europe&amp;ei=rwUuTZ7aDI2XOuCnnIEK&amp;usg=AFQjCNEcNk4Y5os48OIIWwrDGtetE_8RmA&amp;sig2=Ui-jNmLCZ4sTFsjJrG5uGQ&amp;cad=rja|title=Kundera's article in pdf format}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the English term ''Central Europe'' was increasingly applied only to the westernmost former Warsaw Pact countries (East Germany, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary) to specify them as communist states that were culturally tied to Western Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://science.jrank.org/pages/11015/Regions-Regionalism-Eastern-Europe-Central-versus-Eastern-Europe.html|title=Central versus Eastern Europe}}&lt;/ref&gt; This usage continued after the end of the Warsaw Pact when these countries started to undergo transition.

The post-World War II period brought blocking of the research on Central Europe in the [[Eastern Bloc]] countries, as its every result proved the dissimilarity of Central Europe, which was inconsistent with the [[Stalinist]] doctrine. On the other hand, the topic became popular in Western Europe and the United States, much of the research being carried out by immigrants from Central Europe.&lt;ref&gt;One of the main representatives was Oscar Halecki and his book ''The limits and divisions of European history'', London and New York 1950&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the communism, publicists and historians in Central Europe, especially anti-communist opposition, came back to their research.&lt;ref&gt;A. Podraza, Europa Środkowa jako region historyczny, 17th Congress of Polish Historians, Jagiellonian University 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''Mayers Enzyklopädisches Lexikon'',&lt;ref&gt;Band 16, Bibliographisches Institut Mannheim/Wien/Zürich, Lexikon Verlag 1980&lt;/ref&gt; Central Europe is a part of Europe composed by the surface of the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Germany, Poland, Switzerland, Austria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Romania, northern marginal regions of Italy and Yugoslavia (northern states- Slovenia, Croatia and Serbia) as well as northeastern France. Sometimes,{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg are not regarded as Central European.
