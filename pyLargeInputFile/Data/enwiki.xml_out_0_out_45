'''Richard Buckminster “Bucky” Fuller''' (July 12, 1895 &amp;ndash; July 1, 1983)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/ebc/article-9365050 |title=Fuller, R Buckminster |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Online |author=Encyclopædia Britannica. |year=2007 |accessdate=April 20, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an American engineer, [[author]], designer, inventor, and [[futurist]].

Fuller published more than 30 books, inventing and popularizing terms such as &quot;[[Spaceship Earth]]&quot;, [[ephemeralization]], and [[Synergetics (Fuller)|synergetics]]. He also developed numerous inventions, mainly architectural designs, the best known of which is the [[geodesic dome]]. Carbon molecules known as [[fullerene]]s were later named by scientists for their resemblance to geodesic spheres.

==Biography==
Fuller was born on July 12, 1895, in [[Milton, Massachusetts]], the son of Richard Buckminster Fuller and Caroline Wolcott Andrews, and also the grandnephew of the [[Transcendentalism|American Transcendentalist]] [[Margaret Fuller]]. He attended [[Friedrich Fröbel|Froebel]]ian Kindergarten. Spending much of his youth on Bear Island, in [[Penobscot Bay]] off the coast of Maine, he had trouble with [[geometry]], being unable to understand the abstraction necessary to imagine that a chalk dot on the blackboard represented a mathematical [[Point (geometry)|point]], or that an imperfectly drawn line with an arrow on the end was meant to stretch off to [[infinity]]. He often made items from materials he brought home from the woods, and sometimes made his own tools. He experimented with designing a new apparatus for human propulsion of small boats.

Years later, he decided that this sort of experience had provided him with not only an interest in design, but also a habit of being familiar with and knowledgeable about the materials that his later projects would require. Fuller earned a [[machinist|machinist's]] certification, and knew how to use the [[press brake]], [[stretch press]], and other tools and equipment used in the [[sheet metal]] trade.&lt;ref name=pawley&gt;{{cite book |last=Pawley |first=Martin |coauthors= |title=Buckminster Fuller |location=New York |publisher=Taplinger |year=1991 |isbn=0-8008-1116-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Academia===
Fuller attended [[Milton Academy]] in Massachusetts, and after that began studying at [[Harvard University|Harvard]]. He was expelled from Harvard twice: first for spending all his money partying with a vaudeville troupe, and then, after having been readmitted, for his &quot;irresponsibility and lack of interest.&quot; By his own appraisal, he was a non-conforming misfit in the fraternity environment.&lt;ref name=pawley /&gt; It was to be many years before he received a [[Doctor of Science|Sc.D.]] from [[Bates College]] in [[Lewiston, Maine]].

===Wartime experience===
Between his sessions at [[Harvard]], Fuller worked in [[Canada]] as a mechanic in a [[textile]] [[factory|mill]], and later as a laborer for the [[meat-packing]] industry. He also served in the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] in [[World War I]], as a shipboard [[radio]] operator, as an editor of a publication, and as a crash-boat commander. After discharge, he worked again for the meat packing industry, thereby acquiring management experience. In 1917, he married Anne Hewlett. During the early 1920s, he and his father-in-law developed the [[Stockade Building System]] for producing light-weight, weatherproof, and fireproof housing&amp;nbsp;— although the company would ultimately fail.&lt;ref name=pawley /&gt;

===Bankruptcy and depression===
By age 32, Fuller was [[bankruptcy|bankrupt]] and jobless, living in public, low-income housing in [[Chicago|Chicago, Illinois]]. In 1922,&lt;ref&gt;R. Buckminster Fuller, Your Private Sky, Page 27&lt;/ref&gt; Fuller's young daughter Alexandra died from complications from [[polio]] and [[spinal meningitis]]. Allegedly, he felt responsible and this caused him to drink frequently and to contemplate [[suicide]] for a while. He finally chose to embark on &quot;an experiment, to find what a single individual [could] contribute to changing the world and benefiting all humanity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/15/automobiles/collectibles/15BUCKY.html?pagewanted=print Design &amp;ndash; A Three-Wheel Dream That Died at Takeoff &amp;ndash; Buckminster Fuller and the Dymaxion Car &amp;ndash; NYTimes.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recovery===
By 1928, Fuller was living in [[Greenwich Village]] and spending much of his time at the popular café [[Romany Marie]]'s,&lt;ref name=&quot;HaberGlueck&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.haberarts.com/fuller.htm |title= Before Buckyballs |author= [[John Haber]] |publisher= Review of [[Noguchi Museum]] ''Best of Friends'' exhibit (May 19, 2006 – October 15, 2006) |quote= [[Isamu Noguchi|Noguchi]], then twenty-five, had already had enough influences for a lifetime&amp;nbsp;— from birth in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], to childhood in [[Japan]] and [[Midwestern United States|the Midwest]], to premedical classes at [[Columbia University|Columbia]], to academic sculpture on the [[Lower East Side, Manhattan|Lower East Side]], to [[Brancusi's circle]] in [[Paris]]. Now his exposure to [[American Modernism|Modernism and &quot;the American century&quot;]] received a decidedly New York influence.&lt;br/&gt;
&quot;Only two years before, on the brink of suicide, Fuller had decided to remake his life and the world. Why not begin on Minetta Street? In 1929, he was shopping around [[Dymaxion house|his first major design]], plans for an inexpensive, modular home that others air-lift right where desired. Now, in exchange for meals, he took on the interior decoration and chairs for Marie's new location. He must have stood out in person, too, ever the talkative, handsome visionary in tie and starched collar.&quot; &lt;br/&gt;

===Geodesic domes===
Fuller taught at [[Black Mountain College]] in [[North Carolina]] during the summers of 1948 and 1949,&lt;ref name=&quot;ExhibitBMC&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://blackmountaincollege.org/content/view/45/60/ |title= IDEAS + INVENTIONS: Buckminster Fuller and Black Mountain College |work= Black Mountain College Museum and Arts Center Exhibit |date= July 15, 2005 – November 26, 2005 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; serving as its Summer Institute director in 1949. There, with the support of a group of professors and students, he began reinventing a project that would make him famous: the [[geodesic dome]]. Although the geodesic dome had been created some 30 years earlier by Dr. [[Walther Bauersfeld]], Fuller was awarded United States patents. He is credited for popularizing this type of structure.

One of his early models was first constructed in 1945 at [[Bennington College]] in Vermont, where he frequently lectured. During 1949, he erected his first geodesic dome building that could sustain its own weight with no practical limits. It was 4.3 meters (14&amp;nbsp;ft) in diameter and constructed of aluminum aircraft tubing and a vinyl-plastic skin, in the form of an [[icosahedron]]. To prove his design, and to awe non-believers, Fuller suspended from the structure's framework several students who had helped him build it. The U.S. government recognized the importance of his work, and employed his firm Geodesics, Inc. in Raleigh, North Carolina to make small domes for the army. Within a few years there were thousands of these domes around the world.

===Best-known work===
For the next half-century, Fuller developed many ideas, designs and inventions, particularly regarding practical, inexpensive shelter and transportation. He documented his life, philosophy and ideas scrupulously by a daily [[diary]] (later called the ''[[Dymaxion Chronofile]]''), and by twenty-eight publications. Fuller financed some of his experiments with inherited funds, sometimes augmented by funds invested by his collaborators, one example being the [[Dymaxion car]] project.

===World stage===
[[File:Biosphère Montréal.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Montreal Biosphère]] by Buckminster Fuller, 1967]]
International recognition began with the success of his huge [[geodesic dome]]s during the 1950s. Fuller taught at [[Washington University in St. Louis]] in 1955, where he met James Fitzgibbon, who would become a close friend and colleague. From 1959 to 1970, Fuller taught at [[Southern Illinois University Carbondale]]. Beginning as an [[assistant professor]], he gained full professorship during 1968, in the School of Art and Design. Working as a designer, scientist, developer, and writer, he lectured for many years around the world. He collaborated at SIU with the designer [[John McHale (artist)|John McHale]]. During 1965, Fuller inaugurated the [[World Design Science Decade]] (1965 to 1975) at the meeting of the [[International Union of Architects]] in Paris, which was, in his own words, devoted to &quot;applying the principles of science to solving the problems of humanity.&quot;

Fuller believed human societies would soon rely mainly on renewable sources of energy, such as solar- and wind-derived electricity. He hoped for an age of &quot;omni-successful education and sustenance of all humanity.&quot; For his lifetime of work, the [[American Humanist Association]] named him the 1969 Humanist of the Year.

===Honors===
Fuller was awarded 28 United States patents&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/patents?as_drrb_ap=q&amp;as_minm_ap=1&amp;as_miny_ap=2007&amp;as_maxm_ap=1&amp;as_maxy_ap=2007&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=1&amp;as_miny_is=2007&amp;as_maxm_is=1&amp;as_maxy_is=2007&amp;q=%22inventor%3A+richard+buckminster+fuller%22&amp;btnG=Search+Patents Partial list of Fuller U.S. patents]&lt;/ref&gt; and many honorary doctorates. In 1960, he was awarded the [[The Franklin Institute Awards|Frank P. Brown Medal]] from [[The Franklin Institute]]. He was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1968.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780-2010: Chapter F|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterF.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=7 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 16, 1970, he received the Gold Medal award from the [[American Institute of Architects]]. He also received numerous other awards, including the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] presented to him on February 23, 1983 by President [[Ronald Reagan]].

===Last filmed appearance===
Fuller's last filmed interview took place on April 3, 1983, in which he presented his analysis of [[Simon Rodia]]'s [[Watts Towers]] as a unique embodiment of the structural principles found in nature. Portions of this interview appear in ''[[I Build the Tower]],'' a [[documentary film]] on Rodia's architectural masterpiece.

===Death===
[[File:Bucky TRIMTAB.jpg|thumb|right|Gravestone (see [[Trim tab#Trim tab as a metaphor|trim tab]])]]
Fuller died on July 1, 1983, 11 days before his 88th birthday. During the period leading up to his death, his wife had been lying [[coma]]tose in a Los Angeles hospital&lt;!-- What was the name of this hospital? --&gt;, dying of [[cancer]]. It was while visiting her there that he exclaimed, at a certain point: &quot;She is squeezing my hand!&quot; He then stood up, suffered a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]], and died an hour later, at age 87. His wife of 66 years died 36 hours later. They are buried in [[Mount Auburn Cemetery]] in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

==Philosophy and worldview==
The grandson of a [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] minister (Arthur Buckminster Fuller),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www25.uua.org/uuhs/duub/articles/arthurbuckminsterfuller.html Arthur Buckminster Fuller]&lt;/ref&gt; R. Buckminster Fuller was also Unitarian.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.harvardsquarelibrary.org/unitarians/fuller.html Buckminster Fuller: Designer of a New World]&lt;/ref&gt; Buckminster Fuller was an early environmental activist. He was very aware of the finite resources the planet has to offer, and promoted a principle that he termed &quot;[[ephemeralization]]&quot;, which, in essence&amp;nbsp;— according to futurist and Fuller disciple [[Stewart Brand]]&amp;nbsp;— Fuller coined to mean &quot;doing more with less&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brand |first=Stewart |title=The Clock of the Long Now |location=New York |publisher=Basic |year=1999 |isbn=046504512X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Resources and waste material from cruder products could be recycled into making more valuable products, increasing the efficiency of the entire process. Fuller also introduced [[Synergetics (Fuller)|synergetics]], an encompassing term which he used broadly as a metaphoric language for communicating experiences using geometric concepts and, more specifically, to reference the empirical study of systems in transformation, with an emphasis on total system behavior unpredicted by the behavior of any isolated components. Fuller coined this term long before the term [[synergy]] became popular.

Fuller was a pioneer in thinking globally, and he explored principles of [[Energy conversion efficiency|energy]] and [[material efficiency]] in the fields of [[architecture]], [[engineering]] and [[design]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fuller |first=R. Buckminster |coauthors= |title=[[Operating Manual for Spaceship Earth]] |location=Carbondale, IL |publisher=Southern Illinois University Press |year=1969 |isbn=080932461X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fuller |first=R. Buckminster |coauthors=Applewhite, E. J. |title=Synergetics |location=New York |publisher=Macmillan |year=1975 |isbn=002541870X}}&lt;/ref&gt; He cited François de Chardenedes' opinion that [[petroleum]], from the standpoint of its replacement cost out of our current energy &quot;budget&quot; (essentially, the net incoming [[solar energy|solar flux]]), had cost nature &quot;over a million dollars&quot; per U.S. gallon (US$300,000 per litre) to produce. From this point of view, its use as a transportation fuel by people commuting to work represents a huge net loss compared to their earnings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fuller |first=R.

Fuller was concerned about [[sustainability]] and about human survival under the existing socio-economic system, yet remained optimistic about humanity's future. Defining wealth in terms of knowledge, as the &quot;technological ability to protect, nurture, support, and accommodate all growth needs of life,&quot; his analysis of the condition of &quot;Spaceship Earth&quot; caused him to conclude that at a certain time during the 1970s, humanity had attained an unprecedented state. He was convinced that the accumulation of relevant knowledge, combined with the quantities of major recyclable resources that had already been extracted from the earth, had attained a critical level, such that competition for necessities was not necessary anymore. Cooperation had become the optimum survival strategy. &quot;Selfishness,&quot; he declared, &quot;is unnecessary and hence-forth unrationalizable.... War is obsolete.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Fuller |first= R. Buckminster |pages= xxv |chapter= Introduction |title= Critical Path |edition= First |year= 1981 |location= New York, N.Y. |publisher= St.Martin's Press |isbn= 0-312-17488-8|quote= &quot;It no longer has to be you or me. Selfishness is unnecessary and hence-forth unrationalizable as mandated by survival. War is obsolete. |nopp= true}}&lt;/ref&gt; He criticized previous utopian schemes as too exclusive, and thought this was a major source of their failure.  To work, he thought that a utopia needed to include everyone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Utopia or oblivion: the prospects for humanity|last=Fuller|first=R. Buckminster|editor=Jaime Snyder|publisher=Lars Müller Publishers|year=2008|location=Baden, Switzerland|isbn=9783037781272}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fuller also claimed that the natural [[analytic geometry]] of the universe was based on arrays of tetrahedra. He developed this in several ways, from the close-packing of spheres and the number of compressive or tensile members required to stabilize an object in space. One confirming result was that the strongest possible homogeneous [[truss]] is cyclically tetrahedral.&lt;ref&gt;Edmondson, Amy, &quot;A Fuller Explanation&quot;, Birkhauser, Boston, 1987, p19 tetrahedra, p110 octet truss&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1970 book ''[[I Seem To Be a Verb]]'', he wrote: &quot;I live on Earth at present, and I don't know what I am. I know that I am not a category. I am not a thing&amp;nbsp;— a noun. I seem to be a verb, an evolutionary process&amp;nbsp;— an integral function of the universe.&quot;

He had become a [[guru]] of the design, architecture, and 'alternative' communities, such as [[Drop City]], the community of experimental artists to whom he awarded the 1966 &quot;Dymaxion Award&quot; for &quot;poetically economic&quot; domed living structures.

===The geodesic dome===
Fuller was most famous for his [[thin-shell structure|lattice shell structures]] - [[geodesic dome]]s, which have been used as parts of military radar stations, civic buildings, environmental protest camps and exhibition attractions. However, the original design came from Dr. [[Walther Bauersfeld]]. Chapter 3 of Fuller's Book ''Critical Path'' states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...&amp;nbsp;I found a similar situation to be existent in World War II. As head mechanical engineer of the U.S.A. Board of Economic Warfare I had available to me copies of any so-called intercepts I wanted. Those were transcriptions of censor-listened-to intercontinental telephone conversations, along with letters and cables that were opened by the censor and often deciphered, and so forth. As a student of patents I asked for and received all the intercept information relating to strategic patents held by both our enemies and our own big corporations&amp;nbsp;...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An examination of the geodesic design by Bauersfeld for the Zeiss [[Planetarium]], built some 20 years prior to Fuller's work, reveals that Fuller's Geodesic Dome patent (U.S. 2,682,235) follows the same methodology as Bauersfeld's design.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telacommunications.com/geodome.htm Geodesic Domes and Charts of the Heavens]&lt;/ref&gt;

Their construction is based on extending some basic principles to build simple &quot;[[tensegrity]]&quot; structures (tetrahedron, [[octahedron]], and the closest packing of spheres), making them lightweight and stable. The patent for geodesic domes was awarded during 1954, part of Fuller's exploration of nature's constructing principles to find design solutions. The Fuller Dome is referenced in the [[Hugo Award]]-winning novel ''[[Stand on Zanzibar]]'' by [[John Brunner (novelist)|John Brunner]], in which a geodesic dome is said to cover the entire island of [[Manhattan]], and it floats on air due to the hot-air balloon effect of the large air-mass under the dome (and perhaps its construction of lightweight materials).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cjfearnley.com/fuller-faq-4.html#ss4.1 The R. Buckminster Fuller FAQ: Geodesic Domes&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transportation===
In the 1930s, Fuller designed and built prototypes of what he hoped would be a safer, aerodynamic car, which he called the [[Dymaxion car|Dymaxion]]. (&quot;Dymaxion&quot; is said to be a [[syllabic abbreviation]] of ''dynamic maximum tension'', or possibly of ''dynamic maximum ion''.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.automuseum.org/NAM_collections_dymaxion2.shtml National Automobile Museum]&lt;/ref&gt; Fuller worked with professional colleagues for three years beginning in 1932 on a design idea Fuller had derived from aircraft technologies. The three prototype cars were different from anything being sold at the time. They had three wheels: two front drive wheels and one rear, steered wheel. The engine was in the rear, and the chassis and body were original designs. The [[aerodynamic]], somewhat tear-shaped body was large enough to seat eleven people and was about {{convert|18|ft|m}} long, resembling a blend of a light aircraft (without wings) and a [[Volkswagen]] van of 1950s vintage. All three prototypes were essentially a mini-bus, and its concept long predated the [[Volkswagen Type 2]] mini-bus conceived in 1947 by [[Ben Pon (senior)|Ben Pon]].

Despite its length, and due to its three-wheel design, the Dymaxion turned on a small [[radius]] and could easily be parked in a tight space. The prototypes were efficient in fuel consumption for their day, traveling about 30 miles  per gallon. Fuller contributed a great deal of his own money to the project, in addition to funds from one of his professional collaborators. An industrial investor was also very interested in the concept. Fuller anticipated the cars could travel on an open highway safely at up to about 160&amp;nbsp;km/h (100 miles  per hour), but, in practise, they were difficult to control and steer above 80&amp;nbsp;km/h (50&amp;nbsp;mph). Investors backed out and research ended after one of the prototypes was involved in a high-profile collision that resulted in a fatality. In 2007, ''[[Time Magazine]]'' reported on the Dymaxion as one of the &quot;50 worst cars of all time&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/article/0,28804,1658545_1657686_1657677,00.html &quot;The 50 Worst Cars of All Time&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1943, industrialist [[Henry J. Kaiser]] asked Fuller to develop a prototype for a smaller car, but Fuller's five-seater design was never developed further.

===Housing===
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2010}}
[[File:Dymaxion house.jpg|thumb|right|A Dymaxion House at [[The Henry Ford]].]]
Fuller's energy-efficient and inexpensive [[Dymaxion House]] garnered much interest, but has never been produced. Here the term &quot;Dymaxion&quot; is used in effect to signify a &quot;radically strong and light tensegrity structure&quot;. One of Fuller's Dymaxion Houses is on display as a permanent exhibit at The Henry Ford in [[Dearborn, Michigan]]. Designed and developed during the mid-1940s, this prototype is a round structure (not a dome), shaped something like the flattened &quot;bell&quot; of certain jellyfish. It has several innovative features, including revolving dresser drawers, and a fine-mist shower that reduces water consumption. According to Fuller biographer Steve Crooks, the house was designed to be delivered in two cylindrical packages, with interior color panels available at local dealers. A circular structure at the top of the house was designed to rotate around a central mast to use natural winds for cooling and air circulation.

Conceived nearly two decades before, and developed in [[Wichita, Kansas]], the house was designed to be lightweight and adapted to windy climates. It was to be inexpensive to produce and purchase, and assembled easily. It was to be produced using factories, workers and technologies that had produced World War II aircraft. It was ultramodern-looking at the time, built of metal, and sheathed in polished [[aluminum]]. The basic model enclosed 90 m² (1000 square feet) of floor area. Due to publicity, there were many orders during the early Post-War years, but the company that Fuller and others had formed to produce the houses failed due to management problems.

During 1969, Fuller began the Otisco Project, named after its location in [[Otisco, New York]]. The project developed and demonstrated [[concrete]] spray technology used in conjunction with mesh covered wireforms as a viable means of producing large scale, load bearing spanning structures built on site without the use of pouring molds, other adjacent surfaces or hoisting.

The initial construction method used a circular concrete footing in which anchor posts were set.  Tubes cut to length and with ends flattened were then bolted together to form a duodeca-rhombicahedron (22 sided hemisphere) geodesic structure with spans ranging to {{convert|60|ft|m}}. The form  was then draped with layers of ¼-inch wire mesh attached by twist ties.  Concrete was then sprayed onto the structure, building up a solid layer which, when cured, would support additional concrete to be added by a variety of traditional means. Fuller referred to these buildings as monolithic ferroconcrete geodesic domes.  The tubular frame form proved too problematic when it came to setting windows and doors, and was abandoned. The second method used iron [[rebar]] set vertically in the concrete footing and then bent inward and welded in place to create the dome's wireform structure and performed satisfactorily. Domes up to three stories tall built with this method proved to be remarkably strong.  Other shapes such as cones, pyramids and arches proved equally adaptable.

The project was enabled by a grant underwritten by [[Syracuse University]] and sponsored by [[US Steel]] (rebar), the Johnson Wire Corp, (mesh) and Portland Cement Company (concrete). The ability to build large complex load bearing concrete spanning structures in free space would open many possibilities in architecture, and is considered as one of Fuller's greatest contributions.

===Alternative map projection===
Fuller also designed an alternative projection map, called the [[Dymaxion map]]. This was designed to show Earth's continents with minimum distortion when projected or printed on a flat surface.

==Quirks==
Fuller was a frequent flier, often crossing time zones. He famously wore three watches; one for the current zone, one for the zone he had departed, and one for the zone he was going to.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2008/06/09/080609fa_fact_kolbert?currentPage=all Annals of Innovation: Dymaxion Man: Reporting &amp; Essays: The New Yorker]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Fuller |first = Buckminster |title = [[Operating Manual for Spaceship Earth]] |publisher = Southern Illinois University Press |location = Carbondale |year = 1969 |isbn = 080932461X}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this respect he follows the jazz drummer [[Buddy Rich]], who in the [[Pete Atkin]] / [[Clive James]] song “The Wristwatch for a Drummer”, also “wears three, one on the right wrist, one on the left, and the third one around his knee”.  The wristwatch in question is the imagined “Omega Incabloc Oyster Accutron 72” for which “Buckminster Fuller designed the case”&lt;ref&gt;[The Wristwatch For A Drummer: http://www.peteatkin.com/c4.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; Fuller also noted that a single sheet of newsprint, inserted over a shirt and under a suit jacket, provided completely effective [[heat insulation]] during long flights.

He experimented with [[polyphasic sleep]], which he called Dymaxion sleep. In 1943, he told ''Time Magazine'' that he had slept only two hours a day for two years. He quit the schedule because it conflicted with his business associates' sleep habits, but stated that Dymaxion sleep could help the United States win World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,774680,00.html | work=Time | title=Science: Dymaxion Sleep | date=October 11, 1943 | accessdate=April 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fuller documented his life copiously from 1915 to 1983, approximately {{convert|270|ft|m}} of papers in a collection called the Dymaxion Chronofile. He also kept copies of all ingoing and outgoing correspondence. The enormous Fuller Collection is currently housed at [[Stanford]] University.
&lt;blockquote&gt;If somebody kept a very accurate record of a human being, going through the era from the Gay 90s, from a very different kind of world through the turn of the century&amp;nbsp;— as far into the twentieth century as you might live. I decided to make myself a good case history of such a human being and it meant that I could not be judge of what was valid to put in or not. I must put everything in, so I started a very rigorous record.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news-service.stanford.edu/news/2003/january22/bucky-122.html Buckminster Fuller conversations]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www-sul.stanford.edu//depts/spc/fuller/about.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Practical achievements==
Fuller introduced a number of concepts, and helped develop others.
Certainly, a number of his projects were not successful in terms of commitment from industry or acceptance by most of the public. However, more than 500,000 geodesic domes have been built around the world and many are in use. According to the Buckminster Fuller Institute,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bfi.org/&lt;/ref&gt; the largest geodesic-dome structures are:
* [[Seagaia Ocean Dome]]: [[Miyazaki, Japan]], 216&amp;nbsp;m (710&amp;nbsp;ft).
* Multi-Purpose Arena: [[Nagoya, Japan]], 187&amp;nbsp;m (614&amp;nbsp;ft).
*[[Tacoma Dome]]: [[Tacoma]], Washington, USA, 162&amp;nbsp;m (530&amp;nbsp;ft).
*[[Superior Dome]]: Northern Michigan Univ. [[Marquette, Michigan]], USA, 160&amp;nbsp;m (525&amp;nbsp;ft).

[[File:Eden Project geodesic domes panorama.jpg|thumb|350px|Panoramic view of the [[geodesic dome]]s at the Eden Project]]

Other notable domes include:
* [[Spaceship Earth (Epcot)|Spaceship Earth]] at Disney World's [[Epcot Center]] in Florida, 80.8-meters (265&amp;nbsp;ft) wide (Spaceship Earth is actually a self supporting geodesic sphere, the only one currently in existence.)
* The [[Gold Dome]] in Oklahoma City, formerly a bank and now a multicultural society and business center.
* Downtown Vancouver, British Columbia, is a geodesic sphere hosting the [[Telus World of Science]], a science centre (formerly called Science World), that was originally the Expo Centre built for [[Expo 86]].
* The dome over a shopping center in downtown Ankara, Turkey, 109.7-meter (360&amp;nbsp;ft) tall
* The dome enclosing a civic center in Stockholm, Sweden, 85.3-meter (280&amp;nbsp;ft) high.
* The world's largest aluminum dome formerly housed the “[[Spruce Goose]]” airplane in [[Long Beach Harbor]], California.

However, contrary to Fuller's hopes, domes are not an everyday sight in most places. In practice, most of the smaller owner-built geodesic structures had disadvantages (see [[geodesic domes]]), including their unconventional appearance.

An interesting spin-off of Fuller's dome-design conceptualization was the [http://www.soccerballworld.com/Historypg2.htm#Buckminster%20Soccer%20Ball Buckminster Ball], which was the official FIFA approved design for footballs ([[association football]]), from their introduction at the 1970 World Cup until recently. The design was a [[truncated icosahedron]] -- essentially a &quot;Geodesic Sphere&quot;, consisting of 12 pentagonal and 20 hexagonal panels. This was used continuously for 34 years until replaced by the 14-panel [[Adidas Teamgeist|Teamgeist]] for the 2006 World Cup.

Fuller was followed (historically) by other designers and architects, such as [[Sir Norman Foster]] and [[Steve Baer]], willing to explore the possibilities of new geometries in the design of buildings, not based on conventional rectangles.

==Language and neologisms==
Buckminster Fuller spoke and wrote in a unique style and said it was important to describe the world as accurately as possible.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;What is important in this connection is the way in which humans reflex spontaneously for that is the way in which they usually behave in critical moments, and it is often &quot;common sense&quot; to reflex in perversely ignorant ways that produce social disasters by denying knowledge and ignorantly yielding to common sense.&quot; Intuition, 1972 Doubleday, New York. p.103&lt;/ref&gt; Fuller often created long run-on sentences and used unusual compound words (omniwell-informed, intertransformative, omni-interaccommodative, omniself-regenerative) as well as terms he himself invented.&lt;ref&gt;He wrote a single unpunctuated sentence approximately 3000 words long titled &quot;What I Am Trying to Do.&quot; And It Came to Pass - Not to Stay Macmillan Publishing, New York, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fuller used the word 'Universe' without the [[definite article|definite]] or [[indefinite article]]s (''a'' or ''the'') and always capitalized the word. Fuller wrote that &quot;by Universe I mean: the aggregate of all humanity's consciously apprehended and communicated (to self or others) Experiences.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;How Little I Know&quot; from And It Came to Pass - Not to Stay Macmillan, 1976&lt;/ref&gt;

The words &quot;down&quot; and &quot;up&quot;, according to Fuller, are awkward in that they refer to a planar concept of direction inconsistent with human experience. The words &quot;in&quot; and &quot;out&quot; should be used instead, he argued, because they better describe an object's relation to a gravitational center, the Earth.  &quot;I suggest to audiences that they say, &quot;I'm going 'outstairs' and 'instairs.'&quot; At first that sounds strange to them; They all laugh about it. But if they try saying in and out for a few days in fun, they find themselves beginning to realize that they are indeed going inward and outward in respect to the center of Earth, which is our Spaceship Earth. And for the first time they begin to feel real &quot;reality.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Intuition'' (1972).&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;World-around&quot; is a term coined by Fuller to replace &quot;worldwide&quot;. The general belief in a [[flat Earth]] died out in [[Classical antiquity]], so using &quot;wide&quot; is an [[anachronism]] when referring to the surface of the Earth&amp;nbsp;— a [[spheroid]]al surface has [[area]] and encloses a [[volume]] but has no width. Fuller held that unthinking use of [[superseded scientific theory|obsolete scientific ideas]] detracts from and misleads intuition. Other neologisms collectively invented by the Fuller family, according to Allegra Fuller Snyder, are the terms '''sunsight''' and '''sunclipse''', replacing ''sunrise'' and ''sunset'' to overturn the geocentric bias of most pre-[[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernican]] [[celestial mechanics]].

Fuller also invented the word &quot;livingry,&quot; as opposed to weaponry (or &quot;killingry&quot;), to mean that which is in support of all human, plant, and Earth life. &quot;The architectural profession&amp;nbsp;— civil, naval, aeronautical, and astronautical&amp;nbsp;— has always been the place where the most competent thinking is conducted regarding livingry, as opposed to weaponry.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Critical Path'', page xxv.&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as contributing significantly to the development of tensegrity technology, Fuller invented the term &quot;[[tensegrity]]&quot; from ''tensional integrity''. &quot;Tensegrity describes a structural-relationship principle in which structural shape is guaranteed by the finitely closed, comprehensively continuous, tensional behaviors of the system and not by the discontinuous and exclusively local compressional member behaviors. Tensegrity provides the ability to yield increasingly without ultimately breaking or coming asunder.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Synergetics'', page 372.&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;Dymaxion&quot;, is a portmanteau of &quot;Dynamic maximum tension&quot;. It was invented by an adman about 1929 at Marshall Field's department store in Chicago to describe Fuller's concept house, which was shown as part of a house of the future store display. These were three words that Fuller used repeatedly to describe his design.

Fuller also helped to popularise the concept of [[Spaceship Earth]]: &quot;The most important fact about Spaceship Earth: an instruction manual didn't come with it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;cjfearnley_com-fortunes_srchstr_Fuller&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Selected Quotes|url=http://www.cjfearnley.com/cgi-bin/cjf-fortunes.pl?srchstr=Fuller&amp;name=Submit}} 090810 cjfearnley.com&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[allotropy|allotrope]] of [[carbon]] - fullerene, and a particular molecule of that allotrope C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; ([[buckminsterfullerene]] or buckyball) has been named after him. The Buckminsterfullerene molecule, which consists of 60 carbon atoms, very closely resembles a spherical version of Fuller's geodesic dome. The 1996 [[Nobel prize]] in chemistry was given to Kroto, Curl, and Smalley for their discovery of the fullerene.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1996/index.html Chemistry 1996&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 12, 2004, the [[United States Post Office]] released a new commemorative stamp honoring R. Buckminster Fuller on the 50th anniversary of his patent for the geodesic dome and by the occasion of his 109th birthday.

Fuller was the subject of two [[documentary]] films: ''[[The World of Buckminster Fuller]]'' (1971) and ''[[Buckminster Fuller: Thinking Out Loud]]'' (1996).

During June 2008, the Whitney Museum of American Art presented &quot;Buckminster Fuller: Starting with the Universe&quot;, the most comprehensive retrospective to date of his work and ideas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whitney.org/www/buckminster_fuller/about.jsp Buckminster Fuller: Starting with the Universe]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William Boyd Watterson II''' (b. July 5, 1958), known as '''Bill Watterson''', is an American [[cartoonist]] and the author of the influential and popular [[comic strip]] ''[[Calvin and Hobbes]]''. His career as a syndicated cartoonist ran from 1985 to 1995; he stopped drawing ''Calvin and Hobbes'' at the end of 1995 with a short statement to newspaper editors and his readers that he felt he had achieved all he could in the comic strip medium. Watterson is known for his views on licensing and comic syndication, as well as for his reclusive nature.

==Early years and education==
Watterson was born in [[Washington, D.C.]], where his father, James G. Watterson (1932—), worked as a [[patent examiner]] while going to [[George Washington University Law School]] before becoming a [[patent attorney]] in 1960.

In 1964, when Bill was six years old, the family moved to [[Chagrin Falls, Ohio]], where his mother, Kathryn Watterson, became a city council member. James was elected as a council member in 1997, holding that position for 12 years before retiring on August 31, 2009 to pursue some artistic &quot;projects and goals&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= http://www.chagrinvalleytimes.com/print_edition.php?id=1106|title=Veteran Chagrin councilman announces retirement| last= Christian |first=Barbara|year=2009|publisher=Chagrin Valley Times|accessdate=2009-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Watterson, who drew his first cartoon at the age of eight, spent a lot of time in childhood alone, occupying his time with drawing and cartooning. This continued throughout his primary and secondary schooling years when he drew cartoons for the school newspaper and yearbook.&lt;ref name=&quot;shortbiography&quot;&gt;{{cite web

| title=A Short Biography of Bill Watterson

| accessdate=2009-09-01
| author=Tim Hulsizer}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time he discovered comics strips like [[Peanuts]] by [[Charles Schulz]], [[Pogo (comics)|Pogo]] and [[Krazy Kat]] which subsequently inspired and influenced his desire to become a professional cartoonist.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} His parents recall him as a very quiet and unassuming child, who would spend hours drawing in his room:

{{Quotation|
&quot;He was a conservative child, not that he was unimaginative, because of course he was. But not in a fantasy way. He and his brother (Tom) would make time-lapse movies and that certainly showed a certain amount of imagination. And he would draw his characters. But he was nothing like Calvin. He didn't have an imaginary friend like Hobbes, and he wasn't a Dennis the Menace.&quot;&lt;br/&gt; — James G. Watterson}}

While attending [[Chagrin Falls High School]], Bill drew a representation of the school mascot, Mortimer the Tiger, for the school newspaper. This tiger was said to be the early inspiration behind Hobbes and the rendering can still be found on school merchandise.

===College===
From 1976 to 1980 Bill Watterson attended [[Kenyon College]] and completed a degree in political science, all the while developing his artistic skills and contributing cartoons for the college newspaper. Many of the cartoons and pieces of artwork Watterson created at Kenyon can now be found online. These comics were the original &quot;Spaceman Spiff&quot; cartoons.

[[Jim Borgman]] had graduated from Kenyon just before Watterson arrived, but his work as a political cartoonist so impressed Bill that he decided to pursue a career as one himself. Borgman worked at ''[[The Cincinnati Post]]'' and gave Watterson encouragement and advice throughout his time as a student.&lt;ref name=&quot;borgman&quot;&gt;&lt;{{Cite book
|title=Disturbing the Peace
|chapter=Introduction by Bill Watterson
|year=1995
|author=Jim Borgman&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1990 speech to Kenyon College graduates, Watterson revealed that during his final year he had painted a copy of Michelangelo's ''[[Creation of Adam]]'' from the [[Sistine Chapel]] on the ceiling of his dorm room:

{{Quotation|
“By standing on a chair, I could reach the ceiling, and I taped off a section, made a grid, and started to copy the picture from my art history book. Working with your arm over your head is hard work, so a few of my more ingenious friends rigged up a scaffold for me by stacking two chairs on my bed, and laying the table from the hall lounge across the chairs and over to the top of my closet. By climbing up onto my bed and up the chairs, I could hoist myself onto the table, and lie in relative comfort two feet under my painting. My roommate would then hand up my paints, and I could work for several hours at a stretch.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The picture took me months to do, and in fact, I didn't finish the work until very near the end of the school year. I wasn't much of a painter then, but what the work lacked in color sense and technical flourish, it gained in the incongruity of having a High Renaissance masterpiece in a college dorm that had the unmistakable odor of old beer cans and older laundry.”}}

Later, when Watterson was coming up with names for the characters of his comic strip, he decided upon Calvin (after the Protestant reformer [[John Calvin]]) and Hobbes (after the social philosopher [[Thomas Hobbes]]) as a &quot;tip of the hat&quot; to the political science department at Kenyon College.

==Early career==
In 1980, Watterson graduated from Kenyon with a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in [[political science]]. Immediately, ''The Cincinnati Post'' offered him a job drawing [[Editorial cartoon|political cartoons]] for a six-month trial period:

{{Quotation|
The agreement was that they could fire me, or I could quit with no questions asked if things didn't work out during the first few months. Sure enough, things didn't work out, and they fired me, no questions asked.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
My guess is that the editor wanted his own [[Jeff MacNelly]] (a Pulitzer winner at 24), and I didn't live up to his expectations. My Cincinnati days were pretty Kafkaesque. I had lived there all of two weeks, and the editor insisted that most of my work be about local, as opposed to national, issues. Cincinnati has a weird, three-party, city manager government, and by the time I figured it out, I was standing in the unemployment lines. I didn't hit the ground running. Cincinnati at that time was also beginning to realize it had major cartooning talent in [[Jim Borgman]] at the city's other paper, ''[[The Cincinnati Enquirer]]'', and I didn't benefit from the comparison.|Watterson explaining his short career with the ''Cincinnati Post''&lt;ref name=&quot;honk&quot;&gt;{{cite web

During the early years of his career he produced several drawings and additional contributions for ''Target: The Political Cartoon Quarterly''. He designed grocery advertisements for four years prior to creating ''Calvin and Hobbes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;groc&quot;&gt;{{Cite book

==Rise to success==
===Inspiration===
Watterson has said he believes in his work for the personal fulfillment. As he told the graduating class of 1990 at Kenyon College, &quot;It's surprising how hard we'll work when the work is done just for ourselves.&quot; ''Calvin and Hobbes'' was first published on November 18, 1985. In ''Calvin and Hobbes Tenth Anniversary Book'', he wrote&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Schulz|Charles Schulz]] for ''[[Peanuts]]''; [[Walt Kelly]] for ''[[Pogo (comics)|Pogo]]'' and [[George Herriman]] for ''[[Krazy Kat]]''. Watterson wrote the introduction to the first volume of ''The Komplete Kolor Krazy Kat''.

Watterson's style reflects the influence of [[Winsor McCay]]'s ''[[Little Nemo|Little Nemo in Slumberland]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;bob&quot;&gt;{{cite web

Watterson spent much of his career trying to change the climate of newspaper comics. He believed that the artistic value of comics was being undermined, and that the space they occupied in newspapers continually decreased, subject to arbitrary whims of shortsighted publishers. Furthermore, he opined that art should not be judged by the medium for which it is created (i.e., there is no [[High culture|&quot;high&quot; art]] or [[Low culture|&quot;low&quot; art]]—just [[art]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;tenthanniversary&quot;&gt;{{Cite book

===Fight against merchandising the cartoon characters===
Watterson battled against pressure from publishers to merchandise his work, something he felt would cheapen his comic.&lt;ref name=&quot;cheapcomic&quot;&gt;{{cite web

===Reuben===
Watterson was awarded the [[National Cartoonists Society]]'s Humor Comic Strip Award in 1988 and the society's Reuben Award in 1986;&lt;ref name=&quot;reub&quot;&gt;{{cite web

Watterson wrote a brief, tongue-in-cheek autobiography in the late 1980s.&lt;ref name=&quot;bio&quot;&gt;{{cite web

From September 10, 2001, to January 16, 2002, [[Ohio State University]]'s [[Billy Ireland Cartoon Library &amp; Museum]] exhibited 36 of his [[Sunday strip]]s.

==End of ''Calvin and Hobbes''==
Watterson announced the end of ''Calvin and Hobbes'' on November 9, 1995, with the following letter to newspaper editors:

{{Quotation|
Dear Reader:&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
I will be stopping ''Calvin and Hobbes'' at the end of the year. This was not a recent or an easy decision, and I leave with some sadness. My interests have shifted, however, and I believe I've done what I can do within the constraints of daily deadlines and small panels. I am eager to work at a more thoughtful pace, with fewer artistic compromises. I have not yet decided on future projects, but my relationship with Universal Press Syndicate will continue.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
That so many newspapers would carry ''Calvin and Hobbes'' is an honor I'll long be proud of, and I've greatly appreciated your support and indulgence over the last decade. Drawing this comic strip has been a privilege and a pleasure, and I thank you for giving me the opportunity.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Sincerely,&lt;br/&gt;
Bill Watterson}}

The last strip of ''Calvin and Hobbes'' was published on December 31, 1995.

===Since the end of ''Calvin and Hobbes''===
Since the conclusion of ''Calvin and Hobbes'', Watterson has taken up painting, at one point drawing landscapes of the woods with his father. Watterson has kept away from the public eye and has given no indication of resuming the strip, creating new works based on the characters, or embarking on other projects, though he has published several anthologies of ''Calvin and Hobbes'' strips.

He will not sign autographs or license his characters, staying true to his stated principles. In previous years, he was known to sneak autographed copies of his books onto the shelves of the Fireside Bookshop, a family-owned bookstore in his home of [[Chagrin Falls, Ohio]]. However, after discovering that some people were selling the autographed books online for high prices, he ended this practice as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;2005 AP story&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.projo.com/yourlife/content/projo_20051024_calhobbes.885b8c7.html | title = Calvin and Hobbes creator stays out of view, even at debut of collected strips | date=2005-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Valuing privacy, he is very reluctant to give interviews or make public appearances.

In the years that followed the end of ''Calvin and Hobbes'', there were many attempts to locate Watterson in his home town of Chagrin Falls. Both ''[[The Plain Dealer]]'' and the ''[[Cleveland Scene]]'' sent reporters in 1998 and 2003 respectively but were unable to locate him. In 2005, [[Gene Weingarten]] from ''[[The Washington Post]]'' was sent with a gift of a first edition ''[[Barnaby (comic strip)|Barnaby]]'' book as an incentive for Watterson's cooperation. He passed this, along with a message, to Watterson's parents and declared he would wait in the hotel for as long as it took Watterson to contact him. The next day, Watterson's editor Lee Salem called to tell him that the cartoonist would not be coming.

In 2005, Watterson and his wife Melissa moved from Chagrin Falls to [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://ignatz.brinkster.net/ctigerstrikes.html | first = Neely | last = Tucker | contribution = The Tiger Strikes Again | title = The Washington Post | date = 4 Oct. 2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://ignatz.brinkster.net/cprivacy.html | first = Joe | last = Milicia | title = Calvin and Hobbes Creator Keeps Privacy | publisher = Associated Press | date = 22 Oct. 2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Nevin Martell, who had written about Watterson and ''Calvin and Hobbes'', did succeed in locating Watterson, now living in Cleveland; however, he chose not to confront him directly and instead sent a letter expressing his wish to meet and interview him. Watterson did not respond.

On December 21, 1999 a short piece, written by Watterson to mark the forthcoming end of the comic strip ''[[Peanuts]]'', was published in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;lat&quot;&gt;{{Cite news

In October 2005, Watterson answered 15 questions submitted by readers.&lt;ref name=&quot;faniv&quot;&gt;{{cite web

In October 2007, Watterson wrote a review of ''Schulz and Peanuts'', a biography of Charles Schulz, in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;wsj&quot;&gt;{{Cite news

In 2008, he provided a foreword for the first book collection of [[Richard Thompson (cartoonist)|Richard Thompson's]] ''[[Cul de Sac (comic strip)|Cul De Sac]]'' comic strip.

In early 2010, Watterson was interviewed by ''[[The Plain Dealer]]'' on the 15th anniversary of the end of ''Calvin and Hobbes''. Explaining his decision to discontinue the strip, he said,

{{Quotation|
This isn't as hard to understand as people try to make it. By the end of ten years, I'd said pretty much everything I had come there to say. It's always better to leave the party early. If I had rolled along with the strip's popularity and repeated myself for another five, ten, or twenty years, the people now &quot;grieving&quot; for ''Calvin and Hobbes'' would be wishing me dead and cursing newspapers for running tedious, ancient strips like mine instead of acquiring fresher, livelier talent. And I'd be agreeing with them. I think some of the reason ''Calvin and Hobbes'' still finds an audience today is because I chose not to run the wheels off it. I've never regretted stopping when I did.&lt;ref&gt;

In April 2011, a representative for [[Andrews McMeel]] received a package from a &quot;William Watterson in Cleveland Heights, Ohio&quot;, which contained a 6&quot; x 8&quot; oil-on-board painting of ''Cul de Sac'' character Petey Otterloop, done by Watterson for the ''Team Cul de Sac'' fundraising project for [[Parkinson's Disease]]. His syndicate, which since become [[Universal Uclick]], has said that the painting was the first new artwork from Watterson that the syndicate has seen since ''Calvin and Hobbes'' ended in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/comic-riffs/post/this-just-in-first-new-art-from-calvin-and-hobbes-creator-in-16-years-syndicate-says/2011/04/22/AF7l7NQE_blog.html Washington Post: &quot;THIS JUST IN: First new art from ‘Calvin and Hobbes’ creator in 16 years, syndicate says&quot;, April 22, 2011.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
===Changing the format of the Sunday strip===
Watterson opposed the structure publishers imposed on Sunday newspaper cartoons: the standard cartoon starts with a large, wide rectangle featuring the cartoon's logo or a throwaway panel tangential to the main area so that newspapers pressed for space can remove the top third of the cartoon if they wish; the rest of the strip is presented in a series of rectangles of different widths. In Watterson's opinion, this format limited the cartoonist's options of allowable presentation. After his sabbatical year in 1991 he managed to gain an exception to these constraints for ''Calvin and Hobbes'', allowing him to draw his Sunday strip the way he wanted. In many, panels overlap or contain their own panels; in some, the action progresses diagonally across the strip.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

'''Black''' is the [[color]] of objects that do not emit or [[reflection (physics)|reflect]] [[light]] in any part of the [[visible spectrum]]; they absorb all such frequencies of light. Although black is sometimes described as an &quot;achromatic&quot;, or hueless, color, in practice it can be considered a color, as in expressions like &quot;black cat&quot; or &quot;black paint&quot;.

==Etymology==
The word ''black'' comes from [[Old English language|Old English]] ''blæc'' (&quot;black, dark&quot;, ''also'', &quot;ink&quot;), from [[Proto-Germanic]] *''blakkaz'' (&quot;burned&quot;), from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] *''bhleg-'' (&quot;to burn, gleam, shine, flash&quot;), from base *''bhel-'' (&quot;to shine&quot;), related to [[Old Saxon language|Old Saxon]] ''blak'' (&quot;ink&quot;), [[Old High German]] ''blah'' (&quot;black&quot;), [[Old Norse language|Old Norse]] ''blakkr'' (&quot;dark&quot;), [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ''blaken'' (&quot;to burn&quot;), and [[Swedish language|Swedish]] ''bläck'' (&quot;ink&quot;). More distant cognates include [[Latin]] ''flagrare'' (&quot;to blaze, glow, burn&quot;), and [[Ancient Greek]] ''phlegein'' (&quot;to burn, scorch&quot;). ''Black'' supplanted the wonted Old English word ''sweart'' (&quot;black, dark&quot;), which survives as [[wikt:swart|swart]], [[wikt:swarth|swarth]], and [[wikt:swarthy|swarthy]] (compare [[German language|German]] ''schwarz'' and [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ''zwart'', &quot;black&quot;).

==Color or light in science==
[[File:Bitola-monastery.jpg|thumb|Nighttime]]
Black can be defined as the visual impression experienced when no [[visible light]] reaches the eye. (This makes a contrast with [[white]]ness, the impression of any combination of [[color]]s of [[light]] that equally stimulates all three types of color-sensitive visual receptors.)

Pigments that absorb light rather than reflect it back to the eye &quot;look black&quot;. A black pigment can, however, result from a ''combination'' of several pigments that collectively absorb all colors. If appropriate proportions of three primary pigments are mixed, the result reflects so little light as to be called &quot;black&quot;.

This provides two superficially opposite but actually complementary descriptions of black. Black is the lack of all colors of light, or an exhaustive combination of multiple colors of pigment. See also [[Primary colors]]

In [[physics]], a [[black body]] is a perfect absorber of light, but, by a thermodynamic rule, it is also the best emitter. Thus, the best radiative cooling, out of sunlight, is by using black paint, though it is important that it be black (a nearly perfect absorber) in the [[infrared]] as well.

In elementary science, far [[Ultraviolet]] light is called &quot;[[black light]]&quot; because, unseen, it causes many minerals and other substances to [[Phosphorescence|fluoresce]].

On January 16, 2008, researchers from [[Troy, New York]]’s [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]] announced the creation of the darkest material on the planet. The material, which reflects only .045 percent of light, was created from [[carbon nanotube]]s stood on end. This is 1/30 of the light reflected by the current standard for blackness, and one third the light reflected by the previous record holder for darkest substance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2008/01/16/2139711.htm 30 times darker], [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7190107.stm Darkest ever material created]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Absorption of light===
{{Main|Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)}}

A material is said to be black if most incoming light is [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorbed]] equally in the material. Light ([[electromagnetic radiation]] in the [[visible spectrum]]) [[Interaction#Physics|interacts]] with the [[atom]]s and [[molecules]], which causes the [[energy]] of the light to be converted in to other forms of energy, usually [[heat]]. This means that black surfaces can act as thermal collectors, absorbing light and generating heat(see [[Solar thermal collector]]).

Absorption of light is contrasted by [[Transmittance|transmission]], [[Reflection (physics)|reflection]] and [[Diffuse reflection|diffusion]], where the light is only redirected, causing objects to appear transparent, reflective or [[white]] respectively.

==Usage, symbolism, colloquial expressions==

** E.g., the [[Wall Street Crash 1929]], the [[stock market crash]] on October 29, 1929, which is the start of the [[Great Depression]], is nicknamed Black Tuesday, and was preceded by Black Thursday, a downturn on October 24 the previous week.
** [[Black Monday (1987)|Black Monday]], [[stock market crash]] on October 19, 1987.

'''Bletchley Park''' is an estate located in the town of [[Bletchley]], in [[Buckinghamshire]], [[England]]. During [[World War II]], Bletchley Park was the site of the [[United Kingdom]]'s main [[codebreaking|decryption]] establishment, the [[Government Communications Headquarters#Government Code and Cypher School (GCCS)|Government Code and Cypher School (GC&amp;CS)]] where ciphers and codes of several [[Axis Powers|Axis]] countries were decrypted, most importantly the ciphers generated by the German [[Enigma (machine)|Enigma]] and [[Lorenz cipher|Lorenz]] machines It also housed ''Station X'', a secret radio intercept station. 

The high-level intelligence produced at Bletchley Park, codenamed [[Ultra (cryptography)|Ultra]], provided crucial assistance to the Allied war effort. Sir [[Harry Hinsley]], a Bletchley veteran and the official historian of British Intelligence in World War II, has said that Ultra shortened the war &quot;by not less than two years and probably by four years&quot;; moreover, in the absence of Ultra, it is uncertain how the war would have ended.&lt;ref name=&quot;HinsleyLecture&quot;&gt; {{Harvnb|Hinsley|1996}} &lt;/ref&gt;

As well as the National Codes Centre, Bletchley Park houses the [[The National Museum of Computing|National Museum of Computing]]. It is run by the Bletchley Park Trust and is open to the public. The main manor house is also available for functions and is licensed for ceremonies. Part of the fees for hiring the facilities go to the Trust to maintain the museum. Since 1967, Bletchley has been part of [[Milton Keynes]].

==Early history==
The lands of the Bletchley Park estate were formerly part of the [[Water Eaton, Milton Keynes|Manor of Eaton]], included in the [[Domesday Book]] in 1086. [[Browne Willis]] built a mansion in 1711, but this was pulled down by Thomas Harrison, who had acquired the property in 1793. The estate was first known as Bletchley Park during the ownership of [[Samuel Lipscomb Seckham]], who purchased it in 1877. The estate was sold on 4 June 1883 to Sir [[Herbert Samuel Leon]] (1850–1926), a financier and [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]]. Leon expanded the existing farmhouse into the present mansion.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Legg, ''Early History of Bletchley Park 1235–1937'', Bletchley Park Trust Historic Guides series, No. 1, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

The architectural style is a mixture of [[Victorian Gothic]], [[Tudor Revival architecture|Tudor]] and [[Dutch Baroque architecture|Dutch Baroque]] and was the subject of much bemused comment from those who worked there, or visited, during World War II. Leon's estate covered 581 [[acre]]s (235 [[hectare]]s), of which Bletchley Park occupied about 55 acres (22&amp;nbsp;ha). Leon's wife, Fanny, died in 1937.&lt;ref&gt; {{Citation | last = Foss | first = Valentin | title = Bletchley Park | url = http://www.ma.hw.ac.uk/~foss/valentin/Bletchley%20Park.html | accessdate = 25 March 2011 }} &lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1938 the site was sold to a builder, who planned to demolish the mansion and build a housing estate. Before the demolition could take place, Admiral Sir [[Hugh Sinclair]] (Director of Naval Intelligence and head of [[MI6]]) bought the site. To cover their real purpose, the first government visitors to Bletchley Park described themselves as &quot;Captain Ridley's shooting party&quot;.&lt;ref&gt; {{Harvnb|McKay|2010|p=11}} &lt;/ref&gt; 

The estate was conveniently located within easy walking distance of [[Bletchley]] station, where the &quot;[[Varsity Line]]&quot; between the cities of [[Oxford]] and [[Cambridge]] &amp;ndash; whose universities supplied many of the code-breakers &amp;ndash;  met the (then-[[London, Midland and Scottish Railway|LMSR]]) main [[West Coast Main Line|West Coast railway line]] between London and Birmingham, Manchester, Glasgow.  Starting in 1938, Post Office Telephones laid dedicated cables, for numerous telephone and telegraph circuits, from the nearby repeater station at [[Fenny Stratford]] (on [[Watling Street]], the main road linking London to the north-west, later to be designated the [[A5 road (Great Britain)|A5]]).

==Wartime==
[[File:Turing flat.jpg|right|thumbnail|The cottages in the stableyard were converted from a tack and feed house. Early work on Enigma was performed here by [[Dilly Knox]], [[John R.F. Jeffreys|John Jeffreys]] and [[Alan Turing]]. The windows at the top of the tower open into a room used by Turing.]]

Five weeks before the outbreak of [[World War II]], in [[Warsaw]], [[Poland]]'s ''[[Biuro Szyfrów]]'' (Cipher Bureau) revealed its achievements in decrypting German Enigma ciphers to French and British intelligence. The British used this information as the foundation for their own early efforts to decrypt Enigma.&lt;ref&gt; {{Harvnb|Milner-Barry|1993|p=92}} &lt;/ref&gt; 

The &quot;first wave&quot; of the [[Government Code and Cypher School]] (GC&amp;CS) moved to Bletchley Park on 15 August 1939. The main body of GC&amp;CS, including its Naval, Military and Air Sections, was on the ground floor of the mansion, together with a telephone exchange, a teleprinter room, a kitchen and a dining room. The top floor was allocated to [[MI6]]. The prefabricated wooden huts were still being erected, and initially the entire &quot;shooting party&quot; was crowded into the mansion, its stables and cottages. These were too small, so Elmers School, a neighbouring boys' [[boarding school]], was acquired for the Commercial and Diplomatic Sections.&lt;ref&gt; {{Harvnb|Smith|1999|p=2-3}} &lt;/ref&gt; 

The intelligence produced from decrypts at Bletchley was code-named &quot;[[Ultra (cryptography)|Ultra]]&quot;. It contributed greatly to Allied success in defeating the [[U-boat]]s in the [[Battle of the Atlantic (1939–1945)|Battle of the Atlantic]], and to the British naval victories in the [[Battle of Cape Matapan]] and the [[Battle of North Cape]]. In 1941, Ultra exerted a powerful effect on the [[North African Campaign|North African desert campaign]], against the German army, under General [[Erwin Rommel]]. General Sir [[Claude Auchinleck]] stated that, but for Ultra - &quot;Rommel would have certainly got through to Cairo&quot;. Prior to the [[Normandy landings]] on D-Day in June 1944, the Allies knew the locations of all but two of the 58 German divisions on the Western front. Churchill referred to the Bletchley staff as &quot;The geese that laid the golden eggs and never cackled&quot;.&lt;ref&gt; {{Harvnb|Lewin|2001|p=64}} &lt;/ref&gt;

When the United States joined the war, [[Winston Churchill|Churchill]] agreed with [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt]] to pool resources. A number of American cryptographers were posted to Bletchley Park and were inducted and then integrated into the Ultra structure, being stationed in [[Hut 3]]. From May 1943 onwards there was very close cooperation between the British and American military intelligence organizations.&lt;ref&gt; {{Harvnb|Taylor|1993|pp=71, 72}} &lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, the existence of Bletchley Park, and of the decrypting achievements there, was never officially shared with the [[Soviet Union]], whose war effort would have greatly benefited from regular decrypting of German messages relating to the Eastern Front. This reflected Churchill's concern with security, and his distrust of and hostility to communism, even during the alliance imposed on him by the Nazi threat.   

The only direct enemy action that the site experienced was when three bombs, thought to have been intended for [[Bletchley railway station]], were dropped on 20–21 November 1940. One exploded next to the despatch riders' entrance, shifting the rear end of Hut 4 (the Naval Intelligence hut) two feet on its base. As the huts stood on brick pillars, workmen just winched it back into position while work continued inside.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Bletchley Park National Codes Centre | title = The Cafe in Hut 4 | url = http://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/content//index.rhtm | accessdate = 3 April 2011 }} &lt;/ref&gt;

===Recruitment===
Commander [[Alistair Denniston]], was operational head of GC&amp;CS from its formation from the [[Admiralty|Admiralty's]] [[Room 40]] (NID25) and the [[War Office|War Office's]] [[MI1]]b in 1919, until 1942.&lt;ref&gt; {{Harvnb|Erskine|Smith|2011|p=xiv}} &lt;/ref&gt; On the day that Britain declared war on Germany, he wrote to the [[Foreign Office]] about recruiting &quot;men of the professor type&quot; .&lt;ref&gt; {{Harvnb|Budiansky|2000|p=112}} &lt;/ref&gt; Personal networking was used for the initial recruitment particularly from the universities of Cambridge, Oxford and Aberdeen. Reliable and trustworthy women to perform administrative and clerical tasks were similarly recruited by personal contacts.&lt;ref&gt; {{Harvnb|Hill|2004|pp=13-23}} &lt;/ref&gt; This has been characterised as recruiting &quot;[[Boffin]]s and [[Débutante|Debs]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt; {{Harvnb|Hill|2004|pp=62-71}} &lt;/ref&gt; 

Cryptanalysts were selected for various intellectual achievements, whether they were linguists, chess champions, crossword experts, polyglots or great mathematicians, hence their referring to GC&amp;CS as &quot;the Golf, Cheese and Chess Society&quot;.&lt;ref&gt; {{ Citation | title = BBC News UK: Saving Bletchley for the nation | year = 1999 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/358913.stm | accessdate = 2 February 2011 | date=2 June 1999}} &lt;/ref&gt; In one instance, the ability to solve a ''[[The Daily Telegraph|Daily Telegraph]]'' crossword in under 12 minutes was used as a test. The newspaper was asked to organize a competition, after which each of the successful participants was contacted and asked whether they would be prepared to undertake &quot;a particular type of work as a contribution to the war effort&quot;.  The competition itself was won by F H W Hawes of [[Dagenham]] who finished in less than eight minutes.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Daily Telegraph]], [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/3652606/25000-tomorrow.html &quot;25000 tomorrow&quot;] 23 May 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Some 9,000 people were working at Bletchley Park at the height of the codebreaking efforts in January 1945,&lt;ref name = &quot;Smith89P205-6&quot;&gt; {{Harvnb|Smith|1999|p=20-206}} &lt;/ref&gt; and over 12,000 (of whom more than 80% were women) worked there at some point during the war. A relatively small number of men were also employed on a part-time basis, typically for one shift each week (e.g. [[General Post Office|Post Office]] employees who were experts in Morse code or the German language). Among the famous [[mathematician]]s and [[cryptanalysis|cryptanalysts]] working there, the most influential and the best-known in later years was [[Alan Turing]] who is widely credited with being &quot;The Father of Computer Science&quot;.

===Security===
Sustained breaking of an enemy's ciphers can be a very fragile business. A small change in operating policies or procedures could set back the deciphering process by months, as happened with the [[Cryptanalysis of the Enigma#German Navy 4-rotor Enigma|German Navy 4-rotor Enigma]] used for communicating with [[U-boat]]s from February to December 1942,&lt;ref&gt; {{Harvnb|Mahon|1945|p=77}} &lt;/ref&gt; or even permanently. Knowing that the slightest suspicion by the Axis powers that their ciphers were being broken could lead to such a change, the authorities at Bletchley Park were particularly concerned about security.&lt;ref&gt; {{Harvnb|Hinsley|Stripp|1993|p=vii}} &lt;/ref&gt;

All staff had to sign the [[Official Secrets Act 1939|Official Secrets Act (1939)]], and were instructed that they should never discuss their work outside their immediate section. A May 1942 personal security form stated: {{Blockquote|
* Do not talk at meals ... 
* Do not talk in the transport ... 
* Do not talk travelling ... 
* Do not talk in the billet ... 
* Do not talk by your own fireside ... 
* Be careful even in your Hut ... &lt;ref&gt; {{Harvnb|Hill|2004|pp=128-129}} &lt;/ref&gt;}} The strict adherence to these constraints, and never to ask about anyone else's work, was well accepted in a country where there were many wartime posters stating [[British propaganda during World War II#Careless Talk Costs Lives|''Careless Talk Costs Lives'']]. &lt;ref&gt; {{Harvnb|McKay|2010|p=67}} &lt;/ref&gt; Not until Winterbotham's book ''The Ultra Secret'' was published in 1974&lt;ref&gt; {{ Citation | last = Winterbotham | first = F.W. | author-link = F.W. Winterbotham | title = The Ultra secret: the inside story of Operation Ultra, Bletchley Park and Enigma | place = London | publisher = Orion Books Ltd | origyear = 1974 | year = 2000 | oclc = 222735270 | isbn = 9780752837512 }}  &lt;/ref&gt; did ex-Bletchley Park staff feel that they could reveal something of their wartime work. Deaths before that time meant that many parents, spouses and children were never told more than that it was secret work for the Foreign Office or one of the armed services.&lt;ref&gt; {{Harvnb|Hill|2004|pp=129-135}} &lt;/ref&gt; Even 70 years later, some people still regard themselves bound to remain silent.

===Listening stations===
[[File:Station X bletchleypark.jpg|left|thumbnail|Original listening equipment in the 'Station X' room]]

Initially, a [[radio|wireless]] room was established at Bletchley Park. It was set up in the mansion's water tower and given the code name &quot;Station&amp;nbsp;X&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;WatsonP307&quot;&gt; {{Harvnb|Watson|1993|p=307}} &lt;/ref&gt; a term now sometimes applied to the codebreaking efforts at Bletchley as a whole. The &quot;X&quot; denotes the [[Roman numeral]] &quot;ten&quot;, as this was the tenth such station to be opened by the Secret Intelligence Service. Due to the long radio aerials stretching from the wireless room, the radio station was moved from Bletchley Park to nearby [[Whaddon, Buckinghamshire#Whaddon Hall|Whaddon Hall]] to avoid drawing attention to the site.&lt;ref&gt; {{Harvnb|Smith|Butters|2007|p=10}} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; {{Harvnb|Pidgeon|2003}} &lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, other listening stations – the [[Y-stations]], (such as the ones at [[Chicksands]] in [[Bedfordshire]] and [[Beaumanor Hall]] in [[Leicestershire]] where the headquarters of the War Office &quot;Y&quot; Group was located) – gathered raw signals for processing at Bletchley. Coded messages were taken down by hand and sent to Bletchley on paper by motorcycle couriers or, later, by teleprinter. Bletchley Park is mainly remembered for breaking messages enciphered on the German [[Enigma (machine)|Enigma]] cypher machine, but its greatest cryptographic achievement may have been the breaking of the German on-line teleprinter [[Lorenz cipher]] (known at GC&amp;CS as ''Tunny''). 

===German and Italian signals===
{{see also|Cryptanalysis of the Enigma}}
{{EnigmaSeries}}

Both of the two German electro-mechanical [[rotor machine]]s whose signals were decrypted at Bletchley Park were virtually unbreakable if properly used. It was poor operational procedures and sloppy operator behaviour that allowed the GC&amp;CS cryptanalysts to find ways to read them.

[[File:RebuiltBombeFrontView.jpg|thumbnail|left|The working rebuilt bombe. John Harper led the team that built this (see: [http://www.jharper.demon.co.uk/bombe1.htm The British Bombe: CANTAB The Rebuild Project]). It was officially switched on by [[Prince Edward, Duke of Kent|the Duke of Kent]], patron of the [[British Computer Society]] on 17th July 2008.]]

The majority of the mechanically-enciphered messages subjected to cryptanalysis at Bletchley Park were the product of some variation of the [[Enigma machine|Enigma]] cipher machine. The [[Bombe|bombe]] was an electromechanical device whose function was to discover some of the daily settings of the Enigma machines on the various German military [[Telecommunications network|networks]].&lt;ref&gt;Budiansky (2000) p. 195&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sebag-Montefiore (2004) p. 375&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ Citation | last = Carter | first = Frank | title = From Bombe Stops to Enigma Keys |date = 2004 | publisher = Bletchley Park Codes Centre | url = http://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/content/bombestops.pdf | accessdate = 31 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The functional design was produced by [[Alan Turing ]] with an important contribution from [[Gordon Welchman]], and the engineering was by [[Harold Keen|Harold 'Doc' Keen]] of the [[British Tabulating Machine Company]] at [[Letchworth]].  Each machine was about {{convert|7|ft|m}} wide, {{convert|6|ft|6|in|m}} tall, {{convert|2|ft|m}} deep and weighed about a ton.&lt;ref&gt; {{ Citation | last = Ellsbury | first = Graham | title = The Turing Bombe: What it was and how it worked | chapter = 2. Description of the Bombe | year = 1988 | url = http://www.ellsbury.com/bombe2.htm | accessdate = 1 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the danger of bombes at Bletchley Park being lost if there were to be an aerial bombing raid, five bombe outstations&lt;ref&gt;{{ Citation | title =Bletchley Park Jewels | chapter = Outstations from the Park | url = http://www.mkheritage.co.uk/bpt/outstations/outstations.htm | accessdate = 16 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; were established, at [[Adstock]], [[Gayhurst]], [[Wavendon]], [[Stanmore]], and [[Eastcote]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Toms | first = Susan  | title = Enigma and the Eastcote connection | date = 2005 | url = http://www.ruislip.co.uk/eastcotemod/enigma.htm | accessdate = 16 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Luftwaffe]] messages were the first to be read in quantity. The German navy had much tighter procedures, and the capture of code books was needed before they could be broken. When, in February 1942, the German navy introduced a version of Enigma with a fourth rotor for messages to and from Atlantic U-boats, these became unreadable for a period of ten months.&lt;ref&gt; {{Harvnb|Smith|2006|p=34}} &lt;/ref&gt; Britain produced modified bombes, but it was the success of the [[Bombe#US Navy Bombe|US Navy bombe]] that was the main source of reading messages from this version of Enigma for the rest of the war. Messages were sent to and fro across the Atlantic by enciphered teleprinter links.

[[File:Colossus.jpg|thumbnail|left|A Mark 2 Colossus computer. The ten Colossi were the word's first (semi-) programmable electronic computers, the first having been built in 1943.]]

The [[Lorenz cipher|Lorenz on-line teleprinter cipher (SZ40/42)]] codenamed ''[[Tunny]]'' at Bletchley Park, was even more complicated than Enigma. It was introduced in mid-1942 for messages between German High Command and field commanders. With the help of German operator errors, the cryptanalysts in the [[Testery]] (named after [[Ralph Tester]], its head) worked out the logical structure of the machine despite not knowing its physical form. They devised automatic machinery to help with this, which culminated in [[Colossus computer|Colossus]], the world's first programmable digital electronic computer. This was designed and built by [[Tommy Flowers]] and his team at the [[Post Office Research Station]] at [[Dollis Hill]]. The first was delivered to Bletchley Park in December 1943 and commissioned the following February. Enhancements were developed for the Mark 2 Colossus, the first of which was working at Bletchley Park on the morning of [[Normandy landings|D-day]] in June. Flowers then produced one Colossus a month for the rest of the war, making a total of ten with an eleventh part-built. The machines were operated mainly by members of the [[Women's Royal Naval Service]] (''Wrens'') in a section named the [[Newmanry]] after its head [[Max Newman]].

===Japanese signals===
An outpost of the Government Code and Cypher School had been set up in Hong Kong in 1935, the [[Far East Combined Bureau]] (FECB). The FECB naval staff moved in 1940 to [[Singapore]], then [[Colombo]], [[Sri Lanka|Ceylon]], then [[Kilindini Harbour|Kilindini]], [[Mombasa]], [[Kenya]]. They succeeded in deciphering [[Japanese (language)|Japanese]] codes with a mixture of skill and good fortune.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coastweek.com/codes.htm coastweek.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The Army and Air Force staff went from Singapore to the [[Wireless Experimental Centre]] at [[Delhi]], [[India]].
In early 1942, a six-month crash course in Japanese, for 20 undergraduates from Oxford and Cambridge, was started by the Inter-Service Intelligence school in Bedford, in a building across from the main Post Office. This course was repeated every six months until war's end.

Most of those completing these courses worked on decoding Japanese naval messages in [[Hut 7]], under [[John Tiltman|Col. J. Tiltman]]. By mid-1945 well over 100 personnel were involved with this operation, which co-operated closely with the FECB and the US Signal intelligence Service at [[Arlington Hall]], Virginia. Because of these joint efforts, by August 1945 the Japanese merchant navy was suffering 90% losses at sea.

In 1999, Michael Smith wrote that: &quot;Only now are the British codebreakers (like [[John Tiltman]], [[Hugh Foss]] and [[Eric Nave]]) beginning to receive the recognition they deserve for breaking Japanese codes and cyphers&quot;.&lt;ref&gt; {{Harvnb|Smith|2001|pp=127-151}} &lt;/ref&gt;

===Additional buildings===
[[Image:Hut-1.jpg|thumbnail|right|Hut 1 was the first hut to be constructed.]]
[[Image:BletchleyPark Hut4 01.JPG|thumbnail|right|Hut 4, sited adjacent to the mansion, was used during wartime for naval intelligence. Today, it has been refurbished as a bar and restaurant for the museum.]]
[[Image:Hut6.jpg|right|thumbnail|Hut 6 in 2004.]]
The huts were designated by numbers; in some cases, the hut numbers became associated as much with the work which went on inside the buildings as with the buildings themselves. Because of this, when a section moved from a hut into a larger building, they were still referred to by their &quot;Hut&quot; code name.&lt;ref&gt;Some of this information has been derived from [http://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/content/hist/history/RollofHonour.rhtm The Bletchley Park Trust's Roll of Honour]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some of the hut numbers, and the associated work &lt;ref&gt; {{Harvnb|Smith|Butters|2007}} &lt;/ref&gt;, are:

* ''Hut 1'' – The first hut, built in 1939&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.codesandciphers.org.uk/bletchleypark/tour3.htm Tony Sale &quot;Bletchley Park Tour&quot;, Tour 3]&lt;/ref&gt; used to house the Wireless Station for a short time,&lt;ref name=&quot;WatsonP307&quot;/&gt; later administrative functions such as transport, typing and Bombe maintenance&lt;!--; translation--&gt;

* ''Block G'' - Traffic analysis and deception operations
* ''Block H'' - Lorenz and Colossus (now [[The National Museum of Computing]])

==After the war==
At the end of the war, much of the equipment used and its [[blueprint]]s were destroyed. Although thousands of people were involved in the deciphering efforts, the participants [[Official Secrets Act|remained silent]] for decades about what they had done during the war, and it was only in the 1970s that the work at Bletchley Park was revealed to the general public. After the war, the site belonged to several owners, including [[British Telecom]], the [[Civil Aviation Authority]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bellaonline.com/articles/art9678.asp BellaOnline &quot;Britain's Best Kept Secret&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; and PACE ([[Property Advisors to the Civil Estate]]). GCHQ ([[Government Communications Headquarters]]), the post-war successor organisation to GC&amp;CS, ended training courses at Bletchley Park in 1987.

The local headquarters for the GPO was based here and housed all the engineers for the local area together with all the support they needed.  The Eastern Region training school was also based in the park and later part of the national BT management college which was relocated here from [[Horwood House]].  There was also a teacher-training college.

By 1991, the site was nearly empty and the buildings were at risk of demolition for redevelopment. On 10 February 1992, Milton Keynes Borough Council declared most of the Park a conservation area.  Three days later, on 13 February 1992, the Bletchley Park Trust was formed to maintain the site as a museum devoted to the codebreakers.  The site opened to visitors in 1993, with the museum officially inaugurated by HRH the Duke of Kent, as Chief Patron, in July 1994. On 10 June 1999 the Trust concluded an agreement with the landowner, giving control over much of the site to the Trust.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/content/hist/recent.rhtm Bletchley Park Trust &quot;Bletchley Park History&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Trust is volunteer-based and relies on public support to continue its efforts. Christine Large was appointed Director of the Trust in March 1998. On 1 March 2006, the Park Trust announced that Simon Greenish had been appointed Director Designate, and would work alongside Large in 2006,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/news/docview.rhtm/274794 Bletchley Park Trust Appoints Director Designate], Bletchley Park News, 1 March 2006&lt;/ref&gt; taking over on 1 May 2006.

In October 2005, American billionaire [[Sidney Frank]] donated £500,000 to Bletchley Park Trust to fund a new Science Centre dedicated to [[Alan Turing]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/news/docview.rhtm/274566 Action This Day], Bletchley Park News, 28 February 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

A team headed by [[Tony Sale]] has undertaken reconstruction of a [[Colossus computer]] at [[The National Museum of Computing]], which is also located within the park.&lt;ref name=&quot;codesandciphers.org.uk&quot;&gt;[http://www.codesandciphers.org.uk/lorenz/rebuild.htm Tony Sale &quot;The Colossus Rebuild Project&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; Another team, led by John Harper, has undertaken a rebuild of the [[bombe]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jharper.demon.co.uk/bombe1.htm John Harper &quot;The British Bombe&quot; ]&lt;/ref&gt;  On 6 September 2006, the Trust demonstrated&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2006/sep/07/secondworldwar.world The Guardian &quot;Back in action at Bletchley Park, the black box that broke the Enigma code.&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; that the Bombe was back in action.

==Other museum attractions==
The park is also home to a number of other organizations, both commercial and otherwise.

===National Museum of Computing===
{{main|The National Museum of Computing}}

In 2008 the museum signed a 25-year lease for the park's Block H to establish this national museum on the history of computing. Though separate legal entities, the two trusts work closely together.

The museum includes a reconstructed [[Colossus computer]] by a team headed by [[Tony Sale]],&lt;ref name=&quot;codesandciphers.org.uk&quot;/&gt; along with many important examples of computing machinery.

===Radio Society of Great Britain===
In April 2008 the General Manager of the [[Radio Society of Great Britain]] announced that they were moving the Society's &quot;public headquarters&quot; (library, radio station, museum and bookshop) to Bletchley Park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Relocation Update | journal=RadCom | author=Peter Kirby, GoTWW | month=May | year=2008 | volume=84 |issue=05|page=06 | publisher=[[Radio Society of Great Britain]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The RSGB intended to open the &quot;RSGB Pavilion&quot; in Bletchley Park in late summer to early autumn 2008. However the building allocated to them was beyond economical repair and they will open in a different location during April 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Bletchley Park Latest | journal=RadCom | month=October | year=2008 | volume=84 |issue=10|page=06 | publisher=[[Radio Society of Great Britain]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other attractions===
Other buildings at Bletchley Park feature additional exhibits. Some are only open on specified days.

* The mansion itself is open for tours on Sundays.  It is also open on other days when it is not used for private functions.
* Rebuild of the [[Bombe]] device used to help to decrypt German [[Enigma machine]]-generated signals
* Winston Churchill Exhibit - collection of [[Winston Churchill]] memorabilia
* Projected Picture Trust - collection of vintage [[Film|cinema]] equipment and a small theatre showing World War II-era movie shorts
* Toy &amp; Memorabilia Collection - 1930s period [[toy soldier]]s, [[model trains]], [[model car|model vehicles]], Wm. Britain's lead farm and garden, and other toys, dolls and [[teddy bears]]
* Bletchley Park Garage - cars include two 1930s [[Austin Motor Company]] autos that were used in the movie ''[[The Eagle Has Landed (film)|The Eagle Has Landed]]''
* Bletchley Park Post Office - a recreation of the 1940s post office used as cover for mail delivered to the employees of Bletchley Park.  The gift shop is a publisher of limited edition [[First day of issue|first day covers]].

==Funding needs==
In May 2008 it was announced that the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]] had turned down a request for funds because the foundation only funds Internet-based technology projects. Since Bletchley Park receives no external funding, it is in dire need of financial support. Simon Greenish, the Bletchley Park Trust's director said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We are just about surviving. Money &amp;ndash; or lack of it &amp;ndash; is our big problem here. I think we have two to three more years of survival, but we need this time to find a solution to this.&lt;ref&gt;[http://resources.zdnet.co.uk/articles/imagegallery/0,1000002003,39415278,00.htm ZDNet &quot;Bletchley Park Faces Bleak Future&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On 24 July 2008 more than a hundred academics signed a letter to [[The Times]] condemning the neglect being suffered by the site.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/letters/article4385384.ece ''Letters'' &quot;Saving the heritage of Bletchley Park&quot;], ''[[The Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7517874.stm &quot;Neglect of Bletchley condemned&quot;], [[BBC News]].&lt;/ref&gt;  In September 2008, [[Pretty Good Privacy|PGP]], [[IBM]] and other technology firms announced a fund-raising campaign to repair the facility.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.cnet.com/8301-1009_3-10034884-83.html PGP, IBM help Bletchley Park raise funds]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 November 2008 it was announced that [[English Heritage]] would donate £300,000 to help maintain the buildings at Bletchley Park, and that they were in discussions regarding the donation of a further £600,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7710966.stm &quot;New lifeline for Bletchley Park&quot;], [[BBC News]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2009, the British government announced that personnel who had worked at the park during the war would be recognized with a commemorative badge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/5789263/Enigma-codebreakers-to-be-honoured-finally.html &quot;Enigma codebreakers to be honoured finally&quot;], ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sue Black (computer scientist)|Sue Black]] and others have used [[Twitter]] and other [[social media]] to raise the profile and funding for Bletchley Park.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archimuse.com/mw2010/bios/au_370013252.html Sue Black], [http://www.archimuse.com/mw2010/bios/au_3817.html Jonathan P.

==In popular culture==
[[File:AlanTuring-Bletchley.jpg|thumb|right|[[Stephen Kettle]]'s 2007 statue of [[Alan Turing]] at Bletchley Park]]

*Bletchley featured heavily in ''[[Enigma (novel)|Enigma]]'' and its [[Enigma (2001 film)|2001 film adaptation]]; although filming was done at [[Chicheley Hall]].
*The World War II code breaking sitcom pilot &quot;Satsuma &amp; Pumpkin&quot; was recorded at Bletchley Park in 2003 and featured the late Bob Monkhouse OBE in his last ever screen role.  The BBC declined to produce the show and develop it further before creating effectively the same show on Radio 4 several years later, featuring some of the same cast, entitled Hut 33.  Parts of the unseen pilot are to be shown on documentaries about Bob Monkhouse on both ITV &amp; BBC in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/3549961.stm | work=BBC News | title=Bob Monkhouse's last laugh | date=19 March 2004 | first=Ian | last=Youngs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*The ITV television serial ''[[Danger UXB]]'' featured the character Steven Mount who was a codebreaker at Bletchley, and was driven to a [[nervous breakdown]] (and eventual [[suicide]]) by the stressful and repetitive nature of the work.
*In BBC's Torchwood series, the character Toshiko Sato is revealed to have had a grandfather who worked at Bletchley Park up until the bombing of Pearl Harbor by Japan. Whether he continued working there after Japan declared war on the Allies is unknown.
*A fictionalized version of Bletchley Park is featured in the novel ''[[Cryptonomicon]]'' by [[Neal Stephenson]].
*On 19 June 2007 a 1.5-ton, life-size statue of Alan Turing was unveiled at Bletchley Park. Built from approximately half a million pieces of Welsh [[slate]], it was sculpted by [[Stephen Kettle]], having been commissioned by the late American billionaire [[Sidney Frank]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bletchley Park Unveils Statue Commemorating Alan Turing |url=http://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/news/docview.rhtm/454075 |accessdate=2007-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Bletchley came to wider public attention from the 1999 documentary series ''Station X''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20071101092917/http://www.thg.org.uk/stationx/index.htm Station X (1999) (TV)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bede''' (pronounced &quot;Bead&quot; / {{IPA-en|ˈbiːd|}}; {{lang-ang|Bǣda'' or ''Bēda}}; 672 / 673 – 26 May 735), also referred to as '''Saint Bede''' or the '''Venerable Bede''' ({{lang-la|Beda Venerabilis}}), was a [[monk]] at the [[Northumbria]]n [[monastery]] of [[Monkwearmouth-Jarrow Abbey|Saint Peter]] at [[Monkwearmouth]], today part of [[Sunderland, Tyne and Wear|Sunderland]], England, and of its companion monastery, Saint Paul's, in modern [[Jarrow]] (see [[Wearmouth-Jarrow]]), both in the [[Northumbria|Kingdom of Northumbria]]. Bede's monastery had access to a superb library which included works by [[Eusebius]] and [[Orosius]] among many others. 

He is well known as an author and scholar, and his most famous work, ''[[Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum]]'' (''The Ecclesiastical History of the English People'') gained him the title &quot;The Father of [[History of England|English History]]&quot;. In 1899, Bede was made a [[Doctor of the Church]] by [[Leo XIII]], a position of theological significance; he is the only native of Great Britain to achieve this designation ([[Anselm of Canterbury]], also a Doctor of the Church, was originally from Italy).  Bede was moreover a skilled [[linguist]] and [[translator]], and his work with the [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] writings of the early [[Church Fathers]] contributed significantly to [[England|English]] [[Christianity]], making the writings much more accessible to his fellow [[Anglo-Saxons]].

== Life ==
Almost everything that is known of Bede's life is contained in the last chapter of his  ''[[Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum|Historia Ecclesiastica]]'', a history of the church in England. It was completed in about 731,&lt;ref name=Deconstruct5&gt;Brooks &quot;From British to English Christianity&quot; ''Conversion and Colonization'' p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; and Bede implies that he was then in his fifty-ninth year, which would give a likely birth date of about 672–673.&lt;ref name=ASEEncBede&gt;{{harvnb|Ray|2001|pp=57–59}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CM_xix&gt;Colgrave &amp; Mynors, ''Bede's Ecclesiastical History'', p.&amp;nbsp;xix.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ODNB&gt;Campbell &quot;Bede&quot; ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|Bede's words are &quot;Ex quo tempore accepti presbyteratus usque ad annum aetatis meae LVIIII ...&quot;; which means &quot;From the time I became a priest until the fifty-ninth year of my life I have made it my business ... to make brief extracts from the works of the venerable fathers on the holy Scriptures ...&quot;&lt;ref name=CM_566-7&gt;Colgrave &amp; Mynors, ''Bede's Ecclesiastical History'', pp.&amp;nbsp;566&amp;ndash;567.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;World253&quot;/&gt;  Other, less plausible, interpretations of this passage have been suggested&amp;mdash;for example that it means Bede stopped writing about scripture in his fifty-ninth year.&lt;ref name=Whiting_4&gt;Whiting, &quot;The Life of the Venerable Bede&quot;, in Thompson, &quot;Bede: His Life, Times and Writing&quot;, p.&amp;nbsp;4.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=notes}} A minor source of information is the letter by his disciple Cuthbert which relates Bede's death.&lt;ref name=Reread9/&gt;{{#tag:ref|Cuthbert is probably the same person as the later abbot of Wearmouth-Jarrow, but this is not entirely certain.&lt;ref name=Reread9/&gt;|group=notes}}  Bede, in the ''Historia'', gives his birthplace as &quot;on the lands of this monastery&quot;.&lt;ref name=HE_V_24_329&gt;Bede, ''Ecclesiastical History'', V.24, p.&amp;nbsp;329.&lt;/ref&gt; He is referring to the twinned monasteries of [[Monkwearmouth-Jarrow Abbey|Wearmouth and Jarrow]],&lt;ref name=Farmer_19-20&gt;{{harvnb|Farmer|1978|pp=19–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; near modern-day [[Sunderland, Tyne and Wear|Sunderland]] and [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]], respectively; both have been claimed as his birthplace, and there is also a tradition that he was born at [[Monkton, Tyne and Wear|Monkton]], two miles from the monastery at Jarrow.&lt;ref name=ASEEncBede/&gt;&lt;ref name=CM_xix-xx&gt;Colgrave &amp; Mynors, ''Bede's Ecclesiastical History'', pp.&amp;nbsp;xix&amp;ndash;xx.&lt;/ref&gt;  Bede says nothing of his origins, but his connections with men of noble ancestry suggest that his own family was well-to-do.&lt;ref name=World4&gt;{{harvnb|Blair|1990|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bede's first abbot was [[Benedict Biscop]], and the names &quot;Biscop&quot; and &quot;Beda&quot; both appear in a king list of the kings of [[Kingdom of Lindsey|Lindsey]] from around 800, further suggesting that Bede came from a noble family.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt; The name &quot;Bede&quot; was not a common one at the time.  The ''Liber Vitae'' of [[Durham Cathedral]] includes a list of priests; two are named Bede, and one of these is presumably Bede himself. Some manuscripts of the ''Life of Cuthbert'', one of Bede's own works, mention that Cuthbert's own priest was named Bede; it is possible that this priest is the other name listed in the ''Liber Vitae''.  These occurrences, along with a ''Bieda'' who is mentioned in the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' under the year 501, are the only appearances of the name in early sources.&lt;ref name=Reread8/&gt;&lt;ref name=ASC14&gt;Swanton ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' pp. 14&amp;ndash;15&lt;/ref&gt; The name probably derives from the Old English ''bēd'', or prayer; if Bede was given the name at his birth, then his family had probably always planned for him to enter the clergy.&lt;ref name=Reread8/&gt;

At the age of seven, he was sent to the monastery of Wearmouth by his family to be educated by Benedict Biscop and later by [[Ceolfrith]].&lt;ref name=World178&gt;{{harvnb|Blair|1990|p=178}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bede does not say whether it was already intended at that point that he would be a monk.&lt;ref name=World241&gt;{{harvnb|Blair|1990|p=241}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was fairly common in Ireland at this time for young boys, particularly those of noble birth, to be fostered out; the practice was also likely to have been common among the Germanic peoples in England.&lt;ref name=CM_xx&gt;Colgrave &amp; Mynors, ''Bede's Ecclesiastical History'', p.&amp;nbsp;xx.&lt;/ref&gt;  Wearmouth's sister monastery at Jarrow was founded by Ceolfrith in 682, and Bede probably transferred to Jarrow with Ceolfrith that year.&lt;ref name=Farmer_20&gt;{{harvnb|Farmer|1978|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The dedication stone for the church has survived to the present day; it is dated 23 April 685, and as Bede would have been required to assist with menial tasks in his day-to-day life it is possible that he helped in building the original church.&lt;ref name=&quot;CM_xx&quot;/&gt; In 686, plague broke out at Jarrow. The ''Life of Ceolfrith'', written in about 710, records that only two surviving monks were capable of singing the full offices; one was Ceolfrith and the other a young boy, who according to the anonymous writer had been taught by Ceolfrith and was &quot;now a priest of the same monastery&quot;.  After a week of singing the psalms without the usual [[antiphon]]s, Ceolfrith &quot;could not bear it any longer&quot;, and the two managed to restore the usual service, &quot;with no little labour&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Farmer_20&quot;/&gt; The young boy was almost certainly Bede, who would have been about 14.&lt;ref name=World178/&gt;&lt;ref name=Plummer_I_xii&gt;Plummer, ''Bedae Opera Historica'', vol. I, p.&amp;nbsp;xii.&lt;/ref&gt;

When Bede was about 17 years old, [[Adomnan]], the abbot of [[Iona Abbey]], visited Wearmouth and Jarrow. Bede would probably have met the abbot during this visit, and it may be that Adomnan sparked Bede's interest in the [[Easter controversy|Easter dating controversy]].&lt;ref name=World181&gt;{{harvnb|Blair|1990|p=181}}&lt;/ref&gt; In about 692, in Bede's nineteenth year, Bede was ordained a [[deacon]] by his diocesan bishop, [[John of Beverley|John]], who was [[bishop of Hexham]]. The canonical age for the ordination of a deacon was 25; Bede's early ordination may mean that his abilities were considered exceptional,&lt;ref name=CM_xx/&gt; but it is also possible that the minimum age requirement was often disregarded.&lt;ref name=World5&gt;{{harvnb|Blair|1990|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; There might have been minor orders ranking below a deacon; but there is no record of whether Bede held any of these offices.&lt;ref name=World253/&gt;{{#tag:ref|[[Isidore of Seville]] lists six orders below a deacon, but these orders need not have existed at Wearmouth.&lt;ref name=World253&gt;{{harvnb|Blair|1990|p=253}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=notes}} In Bede's thirtieth year (about 702) Bede became a priest, with the ordination again performed by Bishop John.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;

In about 701 Bede wrote his first works, the ''De Arte Metrica'' and ''De Schematibus et Tropis''; both were intended for use in the classroom.&lt;ref name=World5/&gt; He continued to write for the rest of his life, eventually completing over 60 books, most of which have survived. Not all of his output can be easily dated, and Bede may have worked on some texts over a period of many years.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;&lt;ref name=World5/&gt;  His last surviving work is a letter to [[Ecgbert (Archbishop of York)|Ecgbert of York]], a former student, written in 734.&lt;ref name=World5/&gt; A 6th-century Greek and Latin manuscript of ''[[Acts]]'' that is believed to have been used by Bede survives and is now in the [[Bodleian Library]]; it is known as the [[Codex Laudianus]].&lt;ref name=World234&gt;{{harvnb|Blair|1990|p=234}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/bodley/library/specialcollections/western_rarebooks/medieval | title = Classical and Medieval MSS | accessdate=30 December 2010 |publisher=Bodleian Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bede may also have worked on one of the Latin bibles that were copied at Jarrow, one of which is now held by the [[Laurentian Library]] in [[Florence]].&lt;ref name=Farmer_20a&gt;A few pages from another copy are held by the [[British Museum]].{{harvnb|Farmer|1978|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bede was a teacher as well as a writer;&lt;ref name=Ray_57&gt;{{harvnb|Ray|2001|p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; he enjoyed music, and was said to be accomplished as a singer and as a reciter of poetry in the vernacular.&lt;ref name=World5/&gt;  It is possible that he suffered a speech impediment of some kind, but this depends on a phrase in the introduction to his verse life of Saint Cuthbert.  Translations of this phrase differ, and it is quite uncertain whether Bede intended to say that he was cured of a speech problem, or merely that he was inspired by the saint's works.&lt;ref name=Whiting_5-6&gt;Whiting, &quot;The Life of the Venerable Bede&quot;, in Thompson, &quot;Bede: His Life, Times and Writing&quot;, pp.&amp;nbsp;5&amp;ndash;6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FC_W_21&gt;Dorothy Whitelock, &quot;Bede and his Teachers and Friends&quot;, in Bonner, ''Famulus Christi'', p.&amp;nbsp;21.&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|The key phrase is ''per linguae curationem'', which is variously translated as &quot;how his tongue was healed&quot;, &quot;[a] canker on the tongue&quot;, or, following a different interpretation of ''curationem'', &quot;the guidance of my tongue&quot;.&lt;ref name=FC_W_21/&gt;|group=notes}}

In 708, some monks at [[Hexham Abbey|Hexham]] accused Bede of having committed heresy in his work ''De Temporibus''.&lt;ref name=World267&gt;{{harvnb|Blair|1990|p=267}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The standard theological view of world history at the time was known as the [[six ages of the world]]; in his book, Bede calculated the age of the world for himself, rather than accepting the authority of [[Isidore of Seville]], and came to the conclusion that Christ had been born 3,952 years after the creation of the world, rather than the figure of over 5,000 years that was commonly accepted by theologians.&lt;ref name=GHBBV_38&gt;Hurst, ''Bede the Venerable'', p.&amp;nbsp;38.&lt;/ref&gt; The accusation occurred in front of the bishop of Hexham of the time, [[Wilfrid]], who was present at a feast when some drunken monks made the accusation. Wilfrid did not respond to the accusation, but a monk present relayed the episode to Bede, who replied within a few days to the monk, writing a letter setting forth his defence and asking that the letter be read to Wilfrid also.&lt;ref name=&quot;World267&quot;/&gt;{{#tag:ref|The letter itself is in ''Bedae Opera de Temporibus'' edited by C. W. Jones, pp. 307&amp;ndash;315|group=notes}} Bede had another brush with Wilfrid, for the historian himself says that he met Wilfrid, sometime between 706 and 709, and discussed [[Æthelthryth]], the abbess of Ely. Wilfrid had been present at the exhumation of her body in 695, and Bede questioned the bishop about the exact circumstances of the body and asked for more details of her life, as Wilfrid had been her advisor.&lt;ref name=Goffart322&gt;Goffart ''Narrators'' p. 322&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bede.jpg|thumb|225px|right|Bede's tomb in Durham Cathedral]]
In 733, Bede travelled to York, to visit Ecgbert, who was then [[bishop of York]].  The see of York was elevated to an archbishopric in 735, and it is likely that Bede and Ecgbert discussed the proposal for the elevation during his visit.&lt;ref name=World305/&gt;  Bede hoped to visit Ecgbert again in 734, but was too ill to make the journey.&lt;ref name=World305&gt;{{harvnb|Blair|1990|p=305}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bede also travelled to the monastery of [[Lindisfarne]], and at some point visited the otherwise unknown monastery of a monk named {{sic|hide=y|Wicthed}}, a visit that is mentioned in a letter to that monk. Because of his widespread correspondence with others throughout the British Isles, and due to the fact that many of the letters imply that Bede had met his correspondents, it is likely that Bede travelled to some other places, although nothing further about timing or locations can be guessed.&lt;ref name=Reread15&gt;{{harvnb|Higham|2006|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It seems certain that he did not visit Rome, however, as he would have mentioned it in the autobiographical chapter of his ''Historia Ecclesiastica''.&lt;ref name=CM_566&gt;Colgrave &amp; Mynors, Bede's ''Ecclesiastical History'', p.&amp;nbsp;566, n.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Nothhelm]], a correspondent of Bede's who assisted him by finding documents for him in Rome, is known to have visited Bede, though the date cannot be determined beyond the fact that it was after Nothhelm's visit to Rome.&lt;ref name=Plummer_II_3&gt;Plummer, ''Bedae Opera Historica'', vol. II, p.&amp;nbsp;3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bede died on Wednesday, 26 May 735 ([[Ascension Day]]) and was buried at Jarrow.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;  Cuthbert, a disciple of Bede's, wrote a letter to a Cuthwin (of whom nothing else is known), describing Bede's last days and his death.  According to Cuthbert, Bede fell ill &quot;with frequent attacks of breathlessness but almost without pain&quot;, before Easter.  On the Tuesday before Acension Day (26 May) his breathing became worse, and his feet swelled.  He continued to dictate to a scribe, however, and despite spending the night awake in prayer he dictated again the following day.  At three o'clock, according to Cuthbert, he asked for a box of his to be brought, and  distributed among the priests of the monastery &quot;a few treasures&quot; of his: &quot;some pepper, and napkins, and some incense&quot;.  Later that day he dictated a final sentence to the scribe, a boy named Wilberht, and died soon afterwards.&lt;ref name=CM_580-587&gt;Colgrave &amp; Mynors, ''Bede's Ecclesiastical History'', pp.&amp;nbsp;580&amp;ndash;587.&lt;/ref&gt;  Cuthbert's letter also relates a five-line poem in the vernacular that Bede composed on his deathbed, known as &quot;Bede's Death Song&quot;.  It is the most widely copied Old English poem, and appears in 45 manuscripts, but its attribution to Bede is not absolutely certain&amp;mdash;not all manuscripts name Bede as the author, and the ones that do are of later origin than those that do not.&lt;ref name=BEASE_59&gt;Donald Scragg, &quot;Bede's Death Song&quot;, in Lapidge, ''Encyclopaedia of Anglo-Saxon England'', p.&amp;nbsp;59.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CM_580-1&gt;Colgrave &amp; Mynors, ''Bede's Ecclesiastical History'', pp.&amp;nbsp;580&amp;ndash;581, note.&lt;/ref&gt; Bede's remains may have been transferred to Durham Cathedral in the 11th century; his tomb there was looted in 1541, but the contents were probably re-interred in the Galilee chapel at the cathedral.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;

One further oddity in his writings is that in one of his works, the ''Commentary on the Seven Catholic Epistles'', he writes in a manner that gives the impression he was married.&lt;ref name=Reread8&gt;{{harvnb|Higham|2006|pp=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The section in question is the only one in that work that is written in first-person view. Bede says: &quot;Prayers are hindered by the conjugal duty because as often as I perform what is due to my wife I am not able to pray.&quot;&lt;ref name=QWard57&gt;Quoted in Ward ''Venerable Bede'' p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; Another passage, in the ''Commentary on Luke'', also mentions a wife in the first person: &quot;Formerly I possessed a wife in the lustful passion of desire and now I possess her in honourable sanctification and true love of Christ.&quot;&lt;ref name=QWard57/&gt; The historian Benedicta Ward argues that these passages are Bede employing a rhetorical device,&lt;ref name=Ward57&gt;Ward ''Venerable Baede'' p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; but another historian, N. J. Higham, offers no explanation for the passages.&lt;ref name=Reread8/&gt;

Bede wrote scientific, historical and theological works, reflecting the range of his writings from music and [[meter (music)|metrics]] to exegetical [[Scripture]] commentaries. He knew [[Church father|patristic]] literature, as well as [[Pliny the Elder]], [[Virgil]], [[Lucretius]], [[Ovid]], [[Horace]] and other [[classical antiquity|classical]] writers. He knew some Greek and  [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}. His [[Latin language|Latin]] is generally clear, but his Biblical commentaries are more technical.

Bede's scriptural commentaries employed the [[allegory|allegorical]] method of interpretation&lt;ref&gt;Holder (trans.), ''Bede: On the Tabernacle'', (Liverpool: Liverpool Univ. Pr., 1994), pp. xvii&amp;ndash;xx.&lt;/ref&gt; and his history includes accounts of miracles, which to modern historians has seemed at odds with his critical approach to the materials in his history. Modern studies have shown the important role such concepts played in the world-view of Early Medieval scholars.&lt;ref&gt;McClure and Collins, ''The Ecclesiastical History'', pp. xviii&amp;ndash;xix.&lt;/ref&gt;

He dedicated his work on the Apocalypse and the ''De Temporum Ratione'' to the successor of Ceolfrid as abbot, Hwaetbert.&lt;ref name=World187&gt;{{harvnb|Blair|1990|p=187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern historians have completed many studies of Bede's works. His life and work have been celebrated by a series of annual scholarly lectures at St. Paul's Church, Jarrow from 1958 to the present.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stpaulschurchjarrow.com/index.php?p=1_9_The-Jarrow-Lecture The Jarrow Lecture]&lt;/ref&gt; The historian [[Walter Goffart]] says of Bede that he &quot;holds a privileged and unrivalled place among first historians of Christian Europe&quot;.&lt;ref name=Nar236&gt;Goffart ''Narrators'' p. 236&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Bede is mainly studied as a historian now, in his time his works on grammar, chronology, and biblical studies were as important as his historical and hagiographical works. The non-historical works contributed greatly to the [[Carolingian renaissance]].&lt;ref name=Goffart242&gt;Goffart ''Narrators'' pp. 242&amp;ndash;243&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum''==
{{Main|Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum}}

Bede's best-known work is the ''[[Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum]]'', or ''An Ecclesiastical History of the English People''.&lt;ref name=Farmer_21&gt;{{harvnb|Farmer|1978|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Completed in about 731,{{#tag:ref|The traditional date is 731, which Bede gives himself.

=== Sources ===
The monastery at Wearmouth-Jarrow had an excellent library. Both Benedict Biscop and Ceolfrith had acquired books from the Continent, and in Bede's day the monastery was a renowned centre of learning.&lt;ref name=BEASE_MJ&gt;Cramp, &quot;Monkwearmouth (or Wearmouth) and Jarrow&quot;, pp.&amp;nbsp;325–326.&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been estimated that there were about 200 books in the monastic library.&lt;ref name=BEASE_286-7&gt;Michael Lapidge, &quot;Libraries&quot;, in Lapidge, ''Encyclopaedia of Anglo-Saxon England'', pp.&amp;nbsp;286&amp;ndash;287.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the period prior to Augustine's arrival in 597, Bede drew on earlier writers, including [[Solinus]].&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;&lt;ref name=Farmer_25&gt;{{harvnb|Farmer|1978|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He had access to two works of [[Eusebius of Caesarea|Eusebius]]: the ''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Historia Ecclesiastica]]'', and also the ''[[Chronicon (Eusebius)|Chronicon]]'', though he had neither in the original Greek; instead he had a Latin translation of the ''Historia'', by Rufinus, and Saint Jerome's translation of the ''Chronicon''.&lt;ref name=LH_162&gt;Campbell, &quot;Bede&quot;, in Dorey, ''Latin Historians'', p.&amp;nbsp;162.&lt;/ref&gt;  He also knew [[Paulus Orosius|Orosius]]'s ''Adversus Paganus'', and [[Gregory of Tours]]' ''Historia Francorum'', both Christian histories,&lt;ref name=LH_162/&gt; as well as the work of [[Eutropius (historian)|Eutropius]], a pagan historian.&lt;ref name=LH_163&gt;Campbell, &quot;Bede&quot;, in Dorey, ''Latin Historians'', p.&amp;nbsp;163.&lt;/ref&gt;  He used [[Constantius of Lyon|Constantius]]'s ''Life of Germanus'' as a source for [[Germanus of Auxerre|Germanus]]'s visits to Britain.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;&lt;ref name=Farmer_25/&gt;  Bede's account of the invasion of the Anglo-Saxons is drawn largely from [[Gildas]]'s ''[[De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae]]''.&lt;ref name=BEASE_Gildas&gt;Lapidge, &quot;Gildas&quot;, p.&amp;nbsp;204.&lt;/ref&gt;  Bede would also have been familiar with more recent accounts such as [[Eddius Stephanus]]'s ''[[Life of Wilfrid]]'', and anonymous ''Lives'' of Gregory the Great and Cuthbert.&lt;ref name=Farmer_25 /&gt; He also drew on [[Josephus]]'s ''Antiquities'', and the works of [[Cassiodorus]],&lt;ref name=Mey831&gt;Meyvaert &quot;Bede&quot; ''Speculum'' p. 831&lt;/ref&gt; and there was a copy of the ''[[Liber Pontificalis]]'' in Bede's monastery.&lt;ref name=Mey843&gt;Meyvaert &quot;Bede&quot; ''Speculum'' p. 843&lt;/ref&gt;  Bede quotes from several classical authors, including [[Cicero]], [[Plautus]], and [[Terence]], but he may have had access to their work via a Latin grammar rather than directly.&lt;ref name=CM_xxv&gt;Colgrave &amp; Mynors, ''Bede's Ecclesiastical History'', pp.&amp;nbsp;xxv&amp;ndash;xxvi.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, it is clear he was familiar with the works of [[Virgil]] and with [[Pliny the Elder]]'s ''Natural History'', and his monastery also owned copies of the works of [[Dionysius Exiguus]].&lt;ref name=CM_xxv/&gt; He probably drew his account of St. Alban from a life of that saint which has not survived.  He acknowledges two other lives of saints directly; one is a life of [[Saint Fursey|Fursa]], and the other of St. [[Æthelburh of Barking|Æthelburh]]; the latter no longer survives.&lt;ref name=Plummer_I_xxiv&gt;Plummer, ''Bedae Opera Historic'', vol. I, p. xxiv.&lt;/ref&gt;  He also had access to a life of Ceolfrith.&lt;ref name=LH_164&gt;Campbell, &quot;Bede&quot;, in Dorey, ''Latin Historians'', p.&amp;nbsp;164.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of Bede's material came from oral traditions, including a description of the physical appearance of [[Paulinus of York]], who had died nearly 90 years before Bede's ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' was written.&lt;ref name=LH_164/&gt;

Bede also had correspondents who supplied him with material. Albinus, the abbot of the monastery in Canterbury, provided much information about the church in Kent, and with the assistance of [[Nothelm|Nothhelm]], at that time a priest in London, obtained copies of [[Gregory the Great]]'s correspondence from Rome relating to Augustine's mission.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;&lt;ref name=Farmer_25/&gt;&lt;ref name=BEASE_Nothhelm&gt;Keynes, &quot;Nothhelm&quot;, pp.&amp;nbsp;335&amp;nbsp;336.&lt;/ref&gt;  Almost all of Bede's information regarding Augustine is taken from these letters.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;  Bede acknowledged his correspondents in the preface to the ''Historia Ecclesiastica'';&lt;ref name=HE_pref&gt;Bede, ''Historia Ecclesiastica'', Preface, p.&amp;nbsp;42.&lt;/ref&gt; he was in contact with [[Daniel of Winchester|Daniel]], the Bishop of Winchester, for information about the history of the church in Wessex, and also wrote to the monastery at [[Lastingham]] for information about [[Cedd]] and [[Chad of Mercia|Chad]].&lt;ref name=HE_pref/&gt;  Bede also mentions an Abbot Esi as a source for the affairs of the East Anglian church, and Bishop [[Kinebertus|Cynibert]] for information about Lindsey.&lt;ref name=HE_pref/&gt;

The historian [[Walter Goffart]] argues that Bede based the structure of the ''Historia'' on three works, using them as the framework around which the three main sections of the work were structured. For the early part of the work, up until the Gregorian mission, Goffart feels that Bede used [[Gildas]]'s ''De excidio''. The second section, detailing the [[Gregorian mission]] of [[Augustine of Canterbury]] was framed on the anonymous ''Life of Gregory the Great'' written at Whitby. The last section, detailing events after the Gregorian mission, Goffart feels were modelled on [[Eddius|Stephen of Ripon]]'s ''Life of Wilfrid''.&lt;ref name=Goffart296&gt;Goffart ''Narrators'' pp. 296&amp;ndash;307&lt;/ref&gt; Most of Bede's informants for information after Augustine's mission came from the eastern part of Britain, leaving significant gaps in the knowledge of the western areas, which were those areas likely to have a native Briton presence.&lt;ref name=Deconstruct7&gt;Brooks &quot;From British to English Christianity&quot; ''Conversion and Colonization'' pp. 7&amp;ndash;10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Deconstruct12&gt;Brooks &quot;From British to English Christianity&quot; ''Conversion and Colonization'' pp. 12&amp;ndash;14&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Models and style===
Bede's stylistic models included some of the same authors from whom he drew the material for the earlier parts of his history. His introduction imitates the work of Orosius,&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt; and his title is an echo of Eusebius's ''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Historia Ecclesiastica]]''.&lt;ref name=ASEEncBede/&gt;  Bede also followed Eusebius in taking the ''[[Acts of the Apostles]]'' as the model for the overall work: where Eusebius used the ''Acts'' as the theme for his description of the development of the church, Bede made it the model for his history of the Anglo-Saxon church.&lt;ref name=Farmer_26&gt;{{harvnb|Farmer|1978|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bede quoted his sources at length in his narrative, as Eusebius had done.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;  Bede also appears to have taken quotes directly from his correspondents at times. For example, he almost always uses the terms &quot;Australes&quot; and &quot;Occidentales&quot; for the South and West Saxons respectively, but in a passage in the first book he uses &quot;Meridiani&quot; and &quot;Occidui&quot; instead, as perhaps his informant had done.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;  At the end of the work, Bede added a brief autobiographical note; this was an idea taken from [[Gregory of Tours]]' earlier ''History of the Franks''.&lt;ref name=Farmer_27&gt;{{harvnb|Farmer|1978|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bede's work as a hagiographer, and his detailed attention to dating, were both useful preparations for the task of writing the ''Historia Ecclesiastica''. His interest in [[computus]], the science of calculating the date of Easter, was also useful in the account he gives of the controversy between the British and Anglo-Saxon church over the correct method of obtaining the Easter date.&lt;ref name=Farmer_21 /&gt;

Bede's Latin has been praised for its clarity, but his style in the ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' is not simple.  He knew rhetoric, and often used figures of speech and rhetorical forms which cannot easily be reproduced in translation, depending as they often do on the connotations of the Latin words.  However, unlike contemporaries such as [[Aldhelm]], whose Latin is full of difficulties, Bede's own text is easy to read.&lt;ref name=CM_xxxvii&gt;Colgrave &amp; Mynors, ''Bede's Ecclesiastical History'', pp.&amp;nbsp;xxxvii&amp;ndash;xxxviii.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the words of Charles Plummer, one of the best-known editors of the ''Historia Ecclesiastica'', Bede's Latin is &quot;clear and limpid ... it is very seldom that we have to pause to think of the meaning of a sentence ... Alcuin rightly praises Bede for his unpretending style.&quot;&lt;ref name=Plummer_I_liii&gt;Plummer, ''Bedae Opera Historica'', vol. I, pp.&amp;nbsp;liii&amp;ndash;liv.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intent===
Bede's primary intention in writing the ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' was to show the growth of the united church throughout England.  The native Britons, whose Christian church survived the departure of the Romans, earn Bede's ire for refusing to help convert the Saxons; by the end of the ''Historia'' the English, and their Church, are dominant over the Britons.&lt;ref name=CM_xxx&gt;Colgrave &amp; Mynors, ''Bede's Ecclesiastical History'', pp.&amp;nbsp;xxx&amp;ndash;xxxi.&lt;/ref&gt;  This goal, of showing the movement towards unity, explains Bede's animosity towards the British method of calculating Easter: much of the ''Historia'' is devoted to a history of the dispute, including the final resolution at the [[Synod of Whitby]] in 664.&lt;ref name=Farmer_27/&gt;  Bede is also concerned to show the unity of the English, despite the disparate kingdoms that still existed when he was writing.  He also wants to instruct the reader by spiritual example, and to entertain, and to the latter end he adds stories about many of the places and people about which he wrote.&lt;ref name=&quot;CM_xxx&quot;/&gt;

Bede's extensive use of miracles is disconcerting to the modern reader who thinks of Bede as a more or less reliable historian, but men of the time accepted miracles as a matter of course.  However, Bede, like Gregory the Great whom Bede quotes on the subject in the ''Historia'', felt that faith brought about by miracles was a stepping stone to a higher, truer faith, and that as a result miracles had their place in a work designed to instruct.&lt;ref name=CM_xxxiv&gt;Colgrave &amp; Mynors, ''Bede's Ecclesiastical History'', pp.&amp;nbsp;xxxiv&amp;ndash;xxxvi.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Omissions and biases===
Bede is somewhat reticent about the career of [[Wilfrid]], a contemporary and one of the most prominent clerics of his day.  This may be because Wilfrid's opulent lifestyle was uncongenial to Bede's monastic mind; it may also be that the events of Wilfrid's life, divisive and controversial as they were, simply did not fit with Bede's theme of the progression to a unified and harmonious church.&lt;ref name=Farmer_31/&gt;

Bede's account of the early migrations of the Angles and Saxons to England omits any mention of a movement of those peoples across the channel from Britain to Brittany described by [[Procopius]], who was writing in the sixth century.  Frank Stenton describes this omission as &quot;a scholar's dislike of the indefinite&quot;; traditional material that could not be dated or used for the Bede's didactic purposes had no interest for him.&lt;ref name=Stenton_8-9&gt;Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', pp.&amp;nbsp;8&amp;ndash;9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bede was a Northumbrian, and this tinged his work with a local bias.&lt;ref name=JMWH_xxxi&gt;Wallace-Hadrill, ''Historical Commentary'', p.&amp;nbsp;xxxi.&lt;/ref&gt;  The sources he had access to gave him less information about the west of England than for other areas.&lt;ref name=TCOB_119&gt;Yorke, ''The Conversion of Britain'', p.&amp;nbsp;119.&lt;/ref&gt;  He says relatively little about the achievements of Mercia and Wessex, omitting, for example, any mention of [[Boniface]], a West Saxon missionary to the continent of some renown and of whom Bede had almost certainly heard, though Bede does discuss Northumbrian missionaries to the continent.  He also is parsimonious in his praise for [[Aldhelm]], a West Saxon who had done much to convert the native Britons.  He lists seven kings of the Anglo-Saxons whom he regards as having held ''imperium'', or overlordship; only one king of Wessex, [[Ceawlin]], is listed, and none from Mercia, though elsewhere he acknowledges the secular power several of the Mercians held.&lt;ref name=TCOB_21-2&gt;Yorke, ''The Conversion of Britain'', pp.&amp;nbsp;21&amp;ndash;22.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bede relates the story of Augustine's mission from Rome, and tells how the British clergy refused to assist Augustine in the conversion of the Anglo-Saxons.  This, combined with the Gildas's negative assessment of the British church at the time of the Anglo-Saxon invasions, led Bede to a very critical view of the native church.  However, Bede ignores the fact that at the time of Augustine's mission, the history between the two was one of warfare and conquest, which, in the words of Barbara Yorke, would have naturally &quot;curbed any missionary impulses towards the Anglo-Saxons from the British clergy.&quot;&lt;ref name=TCOB_118&gt;Yorke, ''The Conversion of Britain'', p.&amp;nbsp;118.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use of ''Anno Domini''===
At the time Bede wrote the ''Historia Ecclesiastica'', there were two common ways of referring to dates.  One was to use [[indiction]]s, which were 15-year cycles, counting from 312 AD.  There were three different varieties of indiction, each starting on a different day of the year.  The other approach was to use regnal years&amp;mdash;the reigning Roman emperor, for example, or the ruler of whichever kingdom was under discussion.  This meant that in discussing conflicts between kingdoms, the date would have to be given in the regnal years of all the kings involved.  Bede used both these approaches on occasion, but adopted a third method as his main approach to dating: the ''[[anno domini]]'' method invented by [[Dionysius Exiguus]].&lt;ref name=CM_xviii&gt;Colgrave &amp; Mynors, ''Bede's Ecclesiastical History'', pp.&amp;nbsp;xviii&amp;ndash;xix.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although Bede did not invent this method, his adoption of it, and his promulgation of it in ''De Temporum Ratione'', his work on chronology, is the main reason why it is now so widely used.&lt;ref name=CM_xviii/&gt;&lt;ref name=Stenton_186&gt;Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', p.&amp;nbsp;186.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Assessment ===
The ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' was copied often in the Middle Ages, and about 160 manuscripts containing it survive. About half of those are located on the European continent, rather than on the British Isles.&lt;ref name=Companion4/&gt; Most of the 8th- and 9th-century texts of Bede's ''Historia'' come from the northern parts of the [[Carolingian]] Empire.&lt;ref name=Reread21&gt;{{harvnb|Higham|2006|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; This total does not include manuscripts with only a part of the work, of which another 100 or so survive. It was printed for the first time between 1474 and 1482, probably at [[Strasbourg, France]].&lt;ref name=Companion4&gt;Wright ''Companion to Bede'' pp. 4&amp;ndash;5&lt;/ref&gt; Modern historians have studied the ''Historia'' extensively, and a number of editions have been produced.&lt;ref name=Nar236/&gt; For many years, early Anglo-Saxon history was essentially a retelling of the ''Historia'', but recent scholarship has focused as much on what Bede did not write as what he did. The belief that the ''Historia'' was the culmination of Bede's works, the aim of all his scholarship, a belief common among historians in the past, is no longer accepted by most scholars.&lt;ref name=Nar238&gt;Goffart ''Narrators'' pp. 238&amp;ndash;9&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern historians and editors of Bede have been lavish in their praise of his achievement in the ''Historia Ecclesiastica''.  Stenton regarded it as one of the &quot;small class of books which transcend all but the most fundamental conditions of time and place&quot;, and regarded its quality as dependent on Bede's &quot;astonishing power of co-ordinating the fragments of information which came to him through tradition, the relation of friends, or documentary evidence ... In an age where little was attempted beyond the registration of fact, he had reached the conception of history.&quot;&lt;ref name= Stenton_187&gt;Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', p.&amp;nbsp;187.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' has given Bede a high reputation, but his concerns were different from those of a modern writer of history.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;  His focus on the history of the organisation of the English church, and on heresies and the efforts made to root them out, led him to exclude the secular history of kings and kingdoms except where a moral lesson could be drawn or where they illuminated events in the church.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt; Besides the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'', the medieval writers [[William of Malmesbury]], [[Henry of Huntingdon]], and [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] used his works as sources and inspirations.&lt;ref name=Reread27&gt;{{harvnb|Higham|2006|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early modern writers, such as [[Polydore Virgil]] and [[Matthew Parker]], the Elizabethan Archbishop of Canterbury, also utilised the ''Historia'', and his works were used by both Protestant and Catholic sides in the Wars of Religion.&lt;ref name=Reread33&gt;{{harvnb|Higham|2006|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some historians have questioned the reliability of some of Bede's accounts. One historian, Charlotte Behr, feels that the ''Historia's'' account of the arrival of the Germanic invaders in Kent should not be considered to relate what actually happened, but rather relates myths that were current in Kent during Bede's time.&lt;ref name=Behr&gt;Behr &quot;Origins of Kingship&quot; ''Early Medieval Europe'' pp. 25&amp;ndash;52&lt;/ref&gt;

It is likely that Bede's work, because it was so widely copied, discouraged others from writing histories and may even have led to the disappearance of manuscripts containing older historical works.&lt;ref name=Plummer_I_xlvii&gt;Plummer, ''Bedae Opera Historica'', vol. I, p.&amp;nbsp;xlvii and note.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other historical works ==

This manuscript was given to St. Cuthbert's shrine in 934.&lt;ref name=OIHBM_42&gt;Cannon ''Oxford Illustrated History'' pp. 42&amp;ndash;43&lt;/ref&gt;]]

=== Chronicles ===
As Chapter 66 of his ''On the Reckoning of Time'', in 725 Bede wrote the ''Greater Chronicle'' (''chronica maiora''), which sometimes circulated as a separate work. For recent events the ''Chronicle'', like his ''Ecclesiastical History'', relied upon Gildas, upon a version of the [[Liber pontificalis]] current at least to the papacy of [[Pope Sergius I]] (687&amp;ndash;701), and other sources. For earlier events he drew on [[Eusebius]]'s ''Chronikoi Kanones.''  The dating of events in the ''Chronicle'' is inconsistent with his other works, using the era of creation, the [[anno mundi]].&lt;ref&gt;Wallis (trans.), ''The Reckoning of Time'', pp. lxvii&amp;ndash;lxxi, 157&amp;ndash;237, 353&amp;ndash;66&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lives ===
His other historical works included lives of the abbots of [[Jarrow#Wearmouth-Jarrow Priory|Wearmouth and Jarrow]], as well as verse and prose lives of [[Cuthbert of Lindisfarne|Saint Cuthbert of Lindisfarne]], an adaptation of [[Paulinus of Nola]]'s ''Life of St Felix'', and a translation of the Greek ''Passion of [[Saint Anastasius|St Anastasius]]''. He also created a listing of saints, the ''Martyrology''.&lt;ref name=Goffart245&gt;Goffart ''Narrators'' pp. 245&amp;ndash;246&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theological works ==
In his own time, Bede was as well known for his biblical commentaries and exegetical, as well as other theological works. The majority of his writings were of this type, and covered the Old Testament and the New Testament. Most survived the Middle Ages, but a few were lost.&lt;ref name=BedeVen42&gt;{{harvnb|Brown|1987|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was for his theological writings that he earned the title of ''Doctor Anglorum'', and why he was made a saint.&lt;ref name=Theo&gt;Ward &quot;Bede the Theologian&quot; ''The Medieval Theologians'' pp. 57&amp;ndash;64&lt;/ref&gt;

Bede was not an innovative religious thinker. He made no original writings or thoughts on the beliefs of the church, instead working to synthesise and transmit the learning from his predecessors. In order to do this, he learned Greek, and attempted to learn Hebrew. He spent time reading and rereading both the Old and the New Testaments. He mentions that he studied from a text of [[Jerome]]'s [[Vulgate]], which itself was from the Hebrew text. He also studied both the Latin and the Greek Fathers of the Church. In the monastic library at Jarrow were a number of books by theologians, including works by [[Basil of Caesarea|Basil]], [[John Cassian|Cassian]], [[John Chrysostom]], [[Isidore of Seville]], [[Origen]], [[Gregory of Nazianzus]], [[Augustine of Hippo]], Jerome, [[Pope Gregory I]], [[Ambrose of Milan]], [[Cassiodorus]], and [[Cyprian]].&lt;ref name=CM_xxv/&gt;&lt;ref name=Theo/&gt; He used these, in conjunction with the Biblical texts themselves, to write his commentaries and other theological works.&lt;ref name=Theo/&gt; He had a Latin translation by [[Evagrius of Antioch|Evagrius]] of [[Athanasius]]'s ''Life of Antony'', and a copy of [[Sulpicius Severus]]' ''Life of St. Martin''.&lt;ref name=CM_xxv/&gt;  He also used lesser known writers, such as [[Fulgentius of Ruspe|Fulgentius]], [[Julian of Eclanum]], [[Tyconius]], and [[Prosperius]]. Bede was the first to refer to Jerome, Augustine, Pope Gregory and Ambrose as the four Latin [[Fathers of the Church]].&lt;ref name=Ward44&gt;Ward ''Venerable Bede'' p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; It is clear from Bede's own comments that he felt his job was to explain to his students and readers the theology and thoughts of the Church Fathers.&lt;ref name=Mey827&gt;Meyvaert &quot;Bede&quot; ''Speculum'' p. 827&lt;/ref&gt;

Bede also wrote homilies, works written to explain theology used in worship services. Bede wrote homilies not only on the major Christian festivals such as [[Advent]], [[Lent]] or Easter, but on other subjects such as anniversaries of significant events.&lt;ref name=Theo/&gt;

Both types of Bede's theological works circulated widely in the Middle Ages. A number of his biblical commentaries were incorporated into the ''[[Glossa Ordinaria]]'', an 11th-century collection of biblical commentaries. Some of Bede's homilies were collected by [[Paul the Deacon]], and they were used in that form in the [[Monastic Office]]. [[Saint Boniface]] used Bede's homilies in his missionary efforts on the continent.&lt;ref name=Theo/&gt;

Bede sometimes included in his theological books an acknowledgement of the predecessors on whose works he drew.  In two cases he left instructions that his marginal notes, which gave the details of his sources, should be preserved by the copyist, and he may have originally added marginal comments about his sources to others of his works.  Where he does not specify, it is still possible to identify books that he must have had access to by quotations that he uses.  A full catalogue of the library available to Bede in the monastery cannot be reconstructed, but it is possible to tell, for example, that Bede was very familiar with the works of Virgil.  There is little evidence that he had access to any other of the pagan Latin writers&amp;ndash;he quotes many of these writers but the quotes are almost all to be found in the Latin grammars that were common in his day, one or more of which would certainly have been at the monastery.  Another difficulty is that manuscripts of early writers were often incomplete: it is apparent that Bede had access to Pliny's ''Encyclopedia'', for example, but it seems that the version he had was missing book xviii, as he would almost certainly have quoted from it in his ''De temporum ratione''.&lt;ref name=BLTW_Laistner&gt;M.L.W.

He was also the one responsible for replacing the title God in the Hebrew texts to read 'Lord of Hosts.'{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

=== Works on the New Testament ===
Bede's works included ''Commentary on Revelation'',&lt;ref name=Ward51&gt;Ward ''Venerable Bede'' p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; ''Commentary on the Catholic Epistles'',&lt;ref name=Ward56&gt;Ward ''Venerable Bede'' p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; ''Commentary on Acts'', ''Reconsideration on the Books of Acts'',&lt;ref name=Ward58&gt;Ward ''Venerable Bede'' pp. 58&amp;ndash;59&lt;/ref&gt; ''On the Gospel of Mark'', ''On the Gospel of Luke'', and ''Homilies on the Gospels''.&lt;ref name=Ward60&gt;Ward ''Venerable Bede'' p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;

== Works on historical and astronomical chronology ==
''De temporibus'', or ''On Time'', written in about 703, provides an introduction to the principles of Easter [[Computus#History|computus]].&lt;ref name=BedeVen37&gt;{{harvnb|Brown|1987|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was based on parts of [[Isidore of Seville]]'s ''[[Etymologiae|Etymologies]]'', and Bede also include a chronology of the world which was derived from Eusebius, with some revisions based on Jerome's translation of the bible.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;  In about 723,&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt; Bede wrote a longer work on the same subject, ''On the Reckoning of Time'', which was influential throughout the Middle Ages.&lt;ref name=BedeVen38&gt;{{harvnb|Brown|1987|pp=38–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also wrote several shorter letters and essays discussing specific aspects of computus.

''On the Reckoning of Time'' (''[[De temporum ratione]]'') included an introduction to the traditional ancient and medieval view of the [[cosmos]], including an explanation of how the [[spherical earth]] influenced the changing [[length of day]]light, of how the [[season]]al motion of the Sun and Moon influenced the changing appearance of the [[New Moon]] at evening twilight, and a quantitative relation between the changes of the [[Tides]] at a given place and the daily motion of the moon.&lt;ref&gt;Wallis (trans.), ''The Reckoning of Time'', pp. 82&amp;ndash;85, 307&amp;ndash;312&lt;/ref&gt; Since the focus of his book was calculation, Bede gave instructions for [[Easter controversy#Third phase|computing the date of Easter]] and the related time of the Easter Full Moon, for calculating the motion of the Sun and Moon through the [[zodiac]], and for many other calculations related to the calendar. He gives some information about the months of the Anglo-Saxon calendar in chapter XV.&lt;ref&gt;Wallis (trans.), ''The Reckoning of Time'' 15, pp. 53&amp;ndash;4, 285&amp;ndash;7; see also [http://www.nabkal.de/beda/beda_15.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Any codex of [[Beda Venerabilis' Easter cycle|Bede's Easter cycle]] is normally found together with a codex of his &quot;De Temporum Ratione&quot;.

For calendric purposes, Bede made a new calculation of the [[Dating Creation|age of the world]] since the [[Genesis creation narrative|creation]], which he dated as 3952 BC. Due to his innovations in computing the age of the world, he was accused of heresy at the table of Bishop Wilfrid, his chronology being contrary to accepted calculations. Once informed of the accusations of these &quot;lewd rustics,&quot; Bede refuted them in his Letter to Plegwin.&lt;ref&gt;Wallis (trans.),, ''The Reckoning of Time'', pp. xxx, 405&amp;ndash;415&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to these works on astronomical timekeeping, he also wrote ''De natura rerum'', or ''On the Nature of Things'', modelled in part after the work of the same title by [[Isidore of Seville]].&lt;ref name=BedeVen36&gt;{{harvnb|Brown|1987|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His works were so influential that late in the 9th century [[Notker the Stammerer]], a monk of the [[Abbey of St. Gall|Monastery of St. Gall]] in Switzerland, wrote that &quot;God, the orderer of natures, who raised the Sun from the East on the fourth day of Creation, in the sixth day of the world has made Bede rise from the West as a new Sun to illuminate the whole Earth&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Wallis (trans.), ''The Reckoning of Time'', p. lxxxv&lt;/ref&gt;

== Educational works ==
Bede wrote some works designed to help teach grammar in the abbey school. One of these was his ''De arte metrica'', a discussion of the composition of Latin verse, drawing on previous grammarians work. It was based on Donatus' ''De pedibus'' and Servius' ''De finalibus'', and used examples from Christian poets as well as Virgil. It became a standard text for the teaching of Latin verse during the next few centuries. Bede dedicated this work to Cuthbert, apparently a student, for he is named &quot;beloved son&quot; in the dedication, and Bede says &quot;I have laboured to educate you in divine letters and ecclesiastical statutes&quot;&lt;ref name=BedeVen31&gt;{{harvnb|Brown|1987|pp=31–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another textbook of Bede's is the ''De orthographia'', a work on [[orthography]], designed to help a medieval reader of Latin with unfamiliar abbreviations and words from classical Latin works. Although it could serve as a textbook, it appears to have been mainly intended as a reference work. The exact date of composition for both of these works is unknown.&lt;ref name=BedeVen35&gt;{{harvnb|Brown|1987|pp=35–36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another educational work is ''De schematibus et tropis sacrae scripturae'', which discusses the Bible's use of rhetoric.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;  Bede was familiar with pagan authors such as Virgil, but it was not considered appropriate to teach grammar from such texts, and in ''De schematibus ...'' Bede argues for the superiority of Christian texts.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;&lt;ref name=CM_xxvi&gt;Colgrave gives the example of Desiderius of Vienne, who was reprimanded by Gregory the Great for using &quot;heathen&quot; authors in his teaching.&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, his text on poetic metre uses only Christian poetry for examples.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;

== Vernacular poetry ==
According to his disciple Cuthbert, Bede was also ''doctus in nostris carminibus'' (&quot;learned in our songs&quot;). Cuthbert's letter on Bede's death, the ''Epistola Cuthberti de obitu Bedae'', moreover, commonly is understood to indicate that Bede also composed a five line vernacular poem known to modern scholars as ''Bede’s Death Song''

: And he used to repeat that sentence from [[Paul of Tarsus|St. Paul]] “It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God,” and many other verses of Scripture, urging us thereby to awake from the slumber of the soul by thinking in good time of our last hour. And in our own language,—for he was familiar with English poetry,—speaking of the soul’s dread departure from the body:

{| cellpadding=&quot;10&quot; style=&quot;margin:auto;&quot;
|-
| Facing that enforced journey, no man can be &lt;br&gt;
More prudent than he has good call to be, &lt;br&gt;
If he consider, before his going hence, &lt;br&gt;
What for his spirit of good hap or of evil &lt;br&gt;
After his day of death shall be determined.
| Fore ðæm nedfere nænig wiorðe &lt;br&gt;
ðonc snottora ðon him ðearf siæ &lt;br&gt;
to ymbhycgenne ær his hinionge &lt;br&gt;
hwæt his gastæ godes oððe yfles &lt;br&gt;
æfter deað dæge doemed wiorðe.:&lt;ref&gt;Colgrave and Mynors, ''Bede's Ecclesiastical History'', pp. 580&amp;ndash;3&lt;/ref&gt;
|}

As Opland notes, however, it is not entirely clear that Cuthbert is attributing this text to Bede: most manuscripts of the letter do not use a [[finite verb]] to describe Bede's presentation of the song, and the theme was relatively common in Old English and Anglo-Latin literature. The fact that Cuthbert's description places the performance of the Old English poem in the context of a series of quoted passages from Sacred Scripture, indeed, might be taken as evidence simply that Bede also cited analogous vernacular texts.&lt;ref&gt;Opland, ''Anglo-Saxon Oral Poetry'', pp. 140&amp;ndash;141&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the inclusion of the Old English text of the poem in Cuthbert’s Latin letter, the observation that Bede &quot;was learned in our song,&quot; and the fact that Bede composed a Latin poem on the same subject all point to the possibility of his having written it. By citing the poem directly, Cuthbert seems to imply that its particular wording was somehow important, either since it was a vernacular poem endorsed by a scholar who evidently frowned upon secular entertainment&lt;ref&gt;McCready, ''Miracles and the Venerable Bede'', pp. 14&amp;ndash;19&lt;/ref&gt; or because it is a direct quotation of Bede’s last original composition.&lt;ref&gt;See Jeff Opland, ''Anglo-Saxon Oral Poetry'', pp. 140&amp;ndash;141 for a discussion&lt;/ref&gt;

== Veneration ==

There is no evidence for cult being paid to Bede in England in the 8th century. One reason for this may be that he died on the feast day of [[Augustine of Canterbury]]. Later, when he was venerated in England, he was either commemorated after Augustine on 26 May, or his feast was moved to 27 May. However, he was venerated outside England, mainly through the efforts of Saint Boniface and Alcuin, both of whom promoted the cult on the Continent. Boniface wrote repeatedly back to England during his missionary efforts, requesting copies of Bede's theological works. Alcuin, who was taught at the school set up in York by Bede's pupil Egbert, praised Bede as an example for monks to follow and was instrumental in disseminating Bede's works to all of Alcuin's friends.&lt;ref name=Ward136&gt;Ward ''Venerable Bede'' pp. 136&amp;ndash;138&lt;/ref&gt; Bede's cult became prominent in England during the 10th-century revival of monasticism, and by the 14th century had spread to many of the cathedrals of England. [[Wulfstan (Bishop of Worcester)|Wulfstan, Bishop of Worcester]] (c. 1008&amp;ndash;1095) was a particular devotee of Bede's, dedicating a church to him in 1062, which was Wulfstan's first undertaking after his consecration as bishop.&lt;ref name=Ward139&gt;Ward ''Venerable Bede'' p. 139&lt;/ref&gt;

His body was stolen from Jarrow and transferred to Durham Cathedral around 1020, where it was placed in the same tomb with Saint [[Cuthbert of Lindisfarne]]. Later they were moved to a shrine in [[Durham Cathedral|Galilee Chapel]] at Durham Cathedral in 1370. The shrine was destroyed during the English Reformation, but the bones were reburied in the chapel. In 1831 the bones were dug up and then reburied in a new tomb, which is still there.&lt;ref name=Companion4&gt;Wright ''Companion to Bede'' p. 4 caption of the picture.&lt;/ref&gt; Other [[relic]]s were claimed by [[York Minster|York]], [[Glastonbury Abbey|Glastonbury]]{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} and [[Fulda]].&lt;ref name=Reread24&gt;{{harvnb|Higham|2006|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His scholarship and importance to Catholicism were recognised in 1899 when he was declared a [[Doctor of the Church]], and was declared a '''sanctus''' in 1935.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt; He is the only Englishman named a Doctor of the Church.&lt;ref name=Companion4/&gt; He is also the only Englishman in [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s [[Paradiso (Dante)|Paradise]] (''[[Paradiso (Dante)|Paradiso]]'' X.130), mentioned among theologians and doctors of the church in the same canto as [[Isidore of Seville]] and the Scot [[Richard of St. Victor]].

His feast day was included in the [[General Roman Calendar]] in 1899, for celebration on 27 May rather than on his date of death,  26 May  which was then the feast day of [[Pope Gregory VII|Pope Saint Gregory VII]]; however, the 1969 calendar reforms allowed Bede's feast day to move to its proper day.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} He is venerated in both the Anglican and Roman Catholic Church, with a feast day of 25 May.&lt;ref name=Companion4/&gt;

Bede became known as ''[[Venerable]] Bede'' (Lat.: Beda Venerabilis) by the 9th century,&lt;ref name=Companion&gt;Wright ''Companion to Bede'' p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; but this was not linked to consideration for [[Canonization|sainthood]] by the Roman Catholic Church. According to a legend the epithet was miraculously supplied by angels, thus completing his unfinished epitaph.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02384a.htm Catholic Encyclopedia article ''The Venerable Bede'']&lt;/ref&gt; It is first utilised in connection with Bede in the 9th century, where Bede was grouped with others who were called &quot;venerable&quot; at two ecclesiastical councils held at Aix in 816 and 836. [[Paul the Deacon]] then referred to him as venerable consistently. By the 11th and 12th century, it had become commonplace. However, there are no descriptions of Bede by that term right after his death.&lt;ref name=Reread9&gt;{{harvnb|Higham|2006|pp=9–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pearl Milktea.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Bubble tea]]
'''Bubble tea''', also known as '''foam tea''', is a sweetly flavored [[tea]] beverage invented in [[Taiwan]] in the 1980s. Drink recipes may vary, but most bubble teas contain a tea base mixed with fruit (or fruit syrup) and/or milk. Ice blended versions of the drink are also available, usually in fruit flavors.

One of famous categories of bubble teas is &quot;'''pearl milk tea'''&quot; (also known as &quot;boba (poba) milk tea&quot; and &quot;tapioca (ball) milk tea&quot;) contain small chewy balls made of [[starch]] like [[tapioca]] ([[cassava]]), [[potato]] or [[sweet potato]] called &quot;pearls&quot;, &quot;fenyuan&quot; or &quot;boba (poba)&quot;. Pearls made of jelly are also available in many places. These teas are shaken to mix the ingredients, creating a foam on the top of some varieties, hence the name.

Bubble tea originated in Taiwan in the 1980s, first spread to nearby East Asian countries, migrated to Canada before spreading to [[Chinatown]]s throughout the United States, and then to various college towns along the West Coast.&lt;ref name=&quot;time-ressner&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Boba Drinks|last=Ressner |first=Jeffrey|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,999172,00.html|work=Time|date=February 5, 2001|accessdate=2008-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also bubble tea cafes in the [[UK]].&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian-kingsley&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Bubble tea comes to Britain | last=Kingsley | first=Patrick | url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2011/apr/24/bubble-tea-comes-to-britain| work=The Guardian | date=April 24, 2011 | accessdate=2011-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many variants of the drink, depending on types of tea used and ingredients added. The most popular kinds are &quot;bubble [[black tea]]&quot; ({{zh|t=泡沫紅茶|l=foam red tea}}), &quot;bubble [[green tea]]&quot; (泡沫綠茶), &quot;pearl [[milk tea]]&quot; (珍珠奶茶), &quot;pearl green &amp; milk tea&quot; (珍珠奶綠), &quot;pearl black tea&quot; (珍珠紅茶) and &quot;pearl green tea&quot; (珍珠綠茶) etc.

==Description==
Bubble teas are generally of two distinct types: fruit-flavored teas, and milk teas. However, some shops offer a hybrid &quot;fruit milk tea.&quot; Milk teas may use dairy or [[non-dairy creamer]]s. Other varieties are 100% crushed fruit smoothies with pearls and signature ice cream shakes made from local ice cream sources.  Many American bubble tea vendors sell &quot;milk smoothies&quot;, which is similar to bubble tea but does not actually contain any tea ingredients.  Some small cafes offer sweetener substitutes such as honey, [[agave]], [[stevia]], and [[aspartame]] upon special request.

The oldest known bubble tea consisted of a mixture of hot [[Taiwanese cuisine|Taiwanese]] [[black tea]], small [[tapioca|tapioca pearls]] (粉圓), [[condensed milk]], and syrup (糖漿) or honey.  According to the contested originator (春水堂) from [[Taichung]], the drink was not popular at first, but after being featured on a [[Japan]]ese TV-show, the concept started to be adopted and popularized by drink vendors throughout [[Asia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;珍珠奶茶的制作方法&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Bubble Tea&quot;&gt;http://www.marytown.cn/pearl/&lt;/ref&gt;  Many variations were created, the most common of which is to serve the drink cold rather than hot.  The tea type is frequently replaced.  First was the bubble green tea, which uses jasmine-infused [[green tea]] (茉香綠茶) instead of black tea. Big tapioca pearls (波霸/黑珍珠) were adapted and quickly replaced the small pearls.&lt;ref name=&quot;珍珠奶茶的制作方法&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Bubble Tea&quot; /&gt;  Peach or plum flavoring appeared, then more fruit flavors were added until, in some variations, the tea was removed entirely in favor of real fruit. These fruit versions usually contain colored pearls (and/or &quot;jelly cubes&quot; as in the related drink [[taho]]), the color chosen to match whatever fruit juice is used.  Flavors may be added in the form of powder, fruit juice, pulp, or syrup to hot black or [[green tea]], which is then shaken in a [[cocktail shaker]] or mixed with ice in a [[blender (device)|blender]] until chilled. Cooked tapioca pearls and other mix-ins are added at the end. 

Today one can find shops entirely devoted to bubble tea, similar to the [[juice bar]]s of the early 1990s. Some cafes use plastic dome-shaped lids, while other bubble tea bars serve it using a machine to seal the top of the cup with plastic cellophane.  This allows the tea to be shaken in the serving cup.  The cellophane is then pierced with an oversize straw large enough to allow the pearls to pass through.

==Variants==
Each of the ingredients of bubble tea can have many variations depending on the tea house.  Typically, different types of black tea, green tea, or even coffee can form the basis of this beverage.  The most common black tea varieties are Oolong and Earl Grey, while jasmine green tea is a mainstay at almost all tea houses. Another variation called [[Yuanyang_(drink)|鸳鸯]] (yuanyang, named after the &quot;[[mandarin duck]]&quot;) originated in Hong Kong and consists of half black tea and half coffee.  Decaffeinated versions of teas are sometimes available when the tea house fresh brews the tea base.

The milk in bubble tea is optional, though many tea houses use it. Some cafes use a non-dairy creamer [[milk substitute]] instead of milk because many East Asians are [[lactose intolerance|lactose intolerant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Chao |first=Julie |title=Taiwan tapioca tea on tap |work=San Francisco Examiner |date=December 12, 1999 |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/e/a/1999/12/12/NEWS3323.dtl }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Soy milk options are widely available for those who avoid dairy products.  This adds a distinct flavor and consistency to the drink.

Different flavorings can be added to bubble tea. Some widely available fruit flavors include [[strawberry]], [[green apple]], [[passion fruit]], [[mango]], [[lemon]], [[watermelon]], [[grape]], [[lychee]], [[peach]], [[pineapple]], [[cantaloupe]], [[honeydew (melon)|honeydew]], [[banana]], [[avocado]], [[coconut]], [[kiwifruit|kiwi]], and [[jackfruit]]. Other popular non-fruit flavors include [[taro]], [[pudding]], [[chocolate]], [[coffee]], [[cafe mocha|mocha]], [[barley]], [[sesame]], [[almond]], [[ginger]], [[lavender]], [[rose]], [[caramel]] and [[viola (plant)|violet]]. Some of the sour fruit flavors are only available in bubble tea without milk as the acidity will curdle the milk. 

Other varieties of the boba drink can include blended drinks. Many stores in the US provide a list of choices to choose from. Some may include coffee blended drinks, or even smoothies. 

Tapioca balls are the prevailing chewy tidbit in bubble tea, but a wide range of other options can be used to add similar texture to the drink. Green pearls have a small hint of [[green tea]] flavor, and are chewier than the traditional tapioca balls. Jelly is also used in small cubes, stars, or rectangular strips, with flavors like [[nata de coco|coconut jelly]], [[konjac]], [[lychee]], [[grass jelly|grass]], [[mango]], and [[green tea]]. Rainbow (a fruit mix), has a pliant, almost crispy consistency. [[azuki bean|Red bean]] or [[mung bean]] mush, also typical toppings for Taiwanese shaved ice, give the drink an added subtle flavour as well as texture. Aloe, egg pudding, sago, and taro balls can also be found in most tea houses to complete the perfect cup of tea.

Single-serving packets of black tea (with powdered milk and sugar included) are available as &quot;Instant Boba Milk Tea&quot;.

Bubble tea cafes will also frequently serve drinks without coffee or tea in them. The base for these drinks is flavoring blended with ice, often called Snow Bubble. All mix-ins that can be added to the bubble tea can also be added to these [[slushie]]-like drinks. One drawback to Snow Bubble is that the coldness of the iced drink may cause the tapioca balls to harden, making them difficult to suck up through a straw and chew. To prevent this from happening, Snow Bubble must be consumed more quickly than bubble tea.

Occasionally, [[nata de coco]] is used in mass-produced bubble tea drinks as a healthier alternative to tapioca. ''Nata de coco'' is high in dietary fiber and low in [[cholesterol]] and [[fat]]. The ''nata de coco'' is sliced into thin strips to make it easier to pass through a straw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fivebyfifty.com/2009/03/17/healthier-bubble-tea |title=Healthier Bubble Tea|publisher=Five by Fifty - Asian Consumer Intelligence|date=March 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{refimprove|date=May 2010}}
Two shops claim to be the creators of bubble tea. One is Chun Shui Tang tea-house (春水堂) in [[Taichung]], Taiwan, where Liu Han Chie experimented with cold [[milk tea]] by adding [[fruit]], syrup, [[sweet potato|candied yams]], and tapioca balls in the early 1980s. Although the drink was not popular at first, a [[Japan]]ese television show generated interest in it among businessmen. The drink became well-known in most parts of East and [[Southeast Asia]] during the 1990s.&lt;ref name=&quot;珍珠奶茶的制作方法&quot; /&gt;

An alternative origin is the Hanlin (翰林) Teahouse in [[Tainan]], [[Taiwan]], owned by Tu Tsong He Hanlin. He made tea using traditional white ''fenyuan,'' or tapioca, which has the appearance of pearls, supposedly resulting in the so-called &quot;pearl tea.&quot; Shortly after, Hanlin changed the white ''fenyuan'' (粉圓) to the black version that is known today.

==Names==
Bubble tea has many other names: 

===Chinese===
*泡沫紅茶  ({{zh|p=pàomò hóngchá|links=no}}): &quot;foam red tea&quot;, by direct translation, this is the drink that is more appropriate for the literal name of &quot;bubble tea.&quot;  Consequently, in Asian countries, &quot;bubble tea&quot; is commonly used to refer to this drink for both simplified Chinese users&lt;ref&gt;http://zhidao.baidu.com/question/86628158.html&lt;/ref&gt; and traditional Chinese users.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.yes411.com/chcanada/listing.php?id=163395&lt;/ref&gt;  There is no tapioca in this particular drink.  To create this, vendors mix hot or warm tea (in this case, [[Tea#Black_tea|black tea]]) with syrup/sugar and ice cubes into a cocktail shaker.  Then they would shake the shaker either by hand for or machine before it is served.  The resulting tea would be covered by a layer of foam/froth and the tea would have a light foamy feel to the taste.&lt;ref&gt;http://diary.blog.yam.com/thomastsao/article/3890258&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://zhidao.baidu.com/question/7636294.html&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Although in English it is called black tea, Taiwanese calls it &quot;red&quot; tea. Nobody says &quot;black&quot; tea.  --&gt;
*泡沫奶茶 ({{zh|p=pàomò nǎichá|links=no}}): &quot;foam milk tea&quot;.  One of the many variants that is prepared the same way as the &quot;foam red tea,&quot; well-shaken before serving.
*珍珠奶茶 or 珍奶) ({{zh|hp=zhēnzhū nǎichá}}): &quot;pearl milk tea,&quot; or more commonly referred to as Bubble Tea by most [[English language|English]] speakers. The &quot;pearl&quot; name originally referred to the small 1/12&quot; tapioca pearls added to the drink.  Though most modern vendors serve only the bigger 1/4&quot; pearls, they will still use &quot;pearl tea&quot; as the name.&lt;ref name=&quot;珍珠奶茶的制作方法&quot;&gt;http://crystalpalace.poempalace.org/cn/pearl009.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
*波霸奶茶 ({{zh|hp=bōbà nǎichá|links=no}}): &quot;boba milk tea&quot; and also commonly referred to as Bubble Tea by English speakers. The name refers to the variant with big 1/4'' tapioca pearls.&lt;ref name=&quot;珍珠奶茶的制作方法&quot; /&gt;
*黑珍珠奶茶 ({{zh|hp=hēi zhēnzhū nǎichá|links=no}}): &quot;black pearl milk tea,&quot; since the bigger 1/4'' tapioca pearls are separately sold as &quot;black pearls&quot; (黑珍珠) in markets, this name was the logical first choice, but &quot;Boba&quot; (波霸) proved more popular with the consumers of the drink. Thus, this name is less commonly used.&lt;ref name = &quot;Bubble Tea&quot; /&gt;
*(奶)茶珍珠 ({{zh|hp=(nǎi) chá zhēnzhū|links=no}}): &quot;(milk) tea pearl&quot; (less common)
*泡泡茶 ({{zh|hp= pào ​pào ​chá|links=no}}): used interchangeably with 珍珠奶茶 to mean &quot;bubble tea&quot; in Singapore.

===English===
*boba (milk) tea or drink
*pearl (milk) tea or drink
*tapioca milk tea drink
*milk pearl tea or drink
*black pearl (milk) tea or drink
*(milk) tea pearl
*tapioca (milk) tea or drink
*bubble cup
*bubble milk
*tapioca smoothie
*frubble

{{Campaignbox War of the Spanish Succession}}

The '''Battle of Blenheim''' (referred to in some countries as the '''Second Battle of Höchstädt'''),  fought on 13 August 1704, was a major battle of the [[War of the Spanish Succession]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NewStyle&quot;/&gt; [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] of [[Kingdom of France|France]] sought to knock [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Leopold]] out of the war by seizing [[Vienna]], the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg]] capital, and gain a favourable peace settlement. The dangers to Vienna were considerable: the [[Maximilian II Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria|Elector of Bavaria]] and [[Ferdinand de Marsin|Marshal Marsin]]'s forces in [[Bavaria]] threatened from the west, and [[Louis Joseph de Bourbon, duc de Vendôme|Marshal Vendôme]]'s large army in northern Italy posed a serious danger with a potential offensive through the [[Brenner Pass]]. Vienna was also under pressure from [[Francis II Rákóczi|Rákóczi]]'s [[Rákóczi's War for Independence|Hungarian revolt]] from its eastern approaches. Realising the danger, the [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|Duke of Marlborough]] resolved to alleviate the peril to Vienna by marching his forces south from [[Bedburg]] and help maintain Emperor Leopold within the [[Grand Alliance (League of Augsburg)|Grand Alliance]].

A combination of deception and brilliant administration – designed to conceal his true destination from friend and foe alike – enabled Marlborough to march 250 miles (400&amp;nbsp;km) unhindered from the [[Low Countries]] to the [[River Danube]] in five weeks. [[Battle of Schellenberg|After securing Donauwörth on the Danube]], Marlborough sought to engage the Elector's and Marsin's army before [[Camille d'Hostun, duc de Tallard|Marshal Tallard]] could bring reinforcements through the [[Black Forest]]. However, with the Franco-Bavarian commanders reluctant to fight until their numbers were deemed sufficient, the Duke enacted a policy of [[Looting|plundering]] in Bavaria designed to force the issue. The tactic proved unsuccessful, but when Tallard arrived to bolster the Elector's army, and [[Prince Eugene of Savoy|Prince Eugene]] arrived with reinforcements for the Allies, the two armies finally met on the banks of the Danube in and around the small village of [[Blindheim]].

Blenheim has gone down in history as one of the turning points of the War of the Spanish Succession. The overwhelming Allied victory ensured the safety of Vienna from the Franco-Bavarian army, thus preventing the collapse of the Grand Alliance. Bavaria was knocked out of the war, and Louis's hopes for a quick victory came to an end. France suffered over 30,000 casualties including the commander-in-chief, Marshal Tallard, who was taken captive to England. Before the 1704 campaign ended, the Allies had taken [[Landau]], and the towns of [[Trier]] (Trèves) and [[Traben-Trarbach|Trarbach]] on the [[Moselle (river)|Moselle]] in preparation for the following year's campaign into France itself.

==Background==
By 1704, the War of the Spanish Succession was in its fourth year. The previous year had been one of success for France and her allies, most particularly on the [[Danube]], where [[Claude-Louis-Hector de Villars|Marshal Villars]] and the Elector of Bavaria had created a direct threat to Vienna, the Habsburg capital.&lt;ref name=chandler124&gt;Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander'', p. 124&lt;/ref&gt; Vienna had been saved by dissension between the two commanders, leading to the brilliant Villars being replaced by the less dynamic Marshal Marsin. Nevertheless, by 1704, the threat was still real: [[Francis II Rákóczi|Rákóczi]]'s Hungarian revolt was already threatening the Empire's eastern approaches, and Marshal Vendôme's forces threatened an invasion from northern Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn: ''The Wars of Louis XIV, 1667–1714'', p. 285&lt;/ref&gt; In the courts of [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]] and [[Madrid]], Vienna's fall was confidently anticipated, an event which would almost certainly have led to the collapse of the [[Grand Alliance (League of Augsburg)|Grand Alliance]].&lt;ref&gt;Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander'', p. 125&lt;/ref&gt;

To isolate the Danube from any Allied intervention, [[François de Neufville, duc de Villeroi|Marshal Villeroi]]'s 46,000 troops were expected to pin the 70,000 Dutch and English troops around [[Maastricht]] in the Low Countries, while General [[Robert Jean Antoine de Franquetot de Coigny|de Coigny]] protected [[Alsace]] against surprise with a further corps.&lt;ref name=chandler124/&gt; The only forces immediately available for Vienna's defence were [[Louis William, Margrave of Baden-Baden|Prince Louis of Baden's]] force of 36,000 stationed in the Lines of Stollhofen&lt;ref&gt;The Lines of Stollhofen are a military chain of posts designed for the defence of the Rhine Valley. The lines ranged {{convert|20|mi|km}} between Stollhofen, a small village on the Rhine, to the Black Forest. The barrier was designed to stop the French marching down the Rhine from Strasbourg.&lt;/ref&gt; to watch Marshal Tallard at Strasbourg; there was also a weak force of 10,000 men under [[Hermann Otto II of Limburg Stirum|Count Styrum]] observing [[Ulm]].

Both the Imperial Austrian Ambassador in London, [[John Wenceslau Wratislaw von Mitrowitz|Count Wratislaw]], and the Duke of Marlborough realised the implications of the situation on the Danube. The Dutch, however, who clung to their troops for their country's protection, were against any adventurous military operation as far south as the Danube and would never willingly permit any major weakening of the forces in the [[Spanish Netherlands]].&lt;ref name=chandler127&gt;Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander'', p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; Marlborough, realising the only way to ignore Dutch wishes was by the use of secrecy and guile, set out to deceive his Dutch allies by pretending to simply move his troops to the [[Moselle (river)|Moselle]] – a plan approved of by [[The Hague]] – but once there, he would slip the Dutch leash and link up with Austrian forces in southern Germany.&lt;ref name=chandler127/&gt; &quot;My intentions&quot;, wrote the Duke from The Hague on 29 April to his governmental confidant, [[Sidney Godolphin, 1st Earl of Godolphin|Sidney Godolphin]], &quot;are to march with the English to [[Koblenz|Coblenz]] and declare that I intend to campaign on the Moselle. But when I come there, to write to the Dutch States that I think it absolutely necessary for the saving of the Empire to march with the troops under my command and to join with those that are in Germany … in order to make measures with Prince Lewis of Baden for the speedy reduction of the Elector of Bavaria.&quot;&lt;ref name=Falkner1&gt;Falkner: ''Blenheim 1704'', p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prelude==
===Antagonists march to the Danube===
:''A scarlet caterpillar, upon which all eyes were at once fixed, began to crawl steadfastly day by day across the map of Europe, dragging the whole war with it.'' – [[Winston Churchill]].&lt;ref&gt;Spencer: ''Blenheim: Battle for Europe'', p. 136&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:March to the Danube 1704.png|thumb|250px|The [[Duke of Marlborough]]'s march from [[Bedburg]] (near [[Cologne]]) to the [[Danube]]. His 250-mile (400-kilometre) march to prevent [[Vienna]] falling into enemy hands was a masterpiece of deception, meticulous planning and organisation.]]

Marlborough's march started on 19 May from Bedburg, {{convert|20|mi|km}} north-west of Cologne. The army (assembled by the Duke's brother, General [[Charles Churchill (British army officer)|Charles Churchill]]) consisted of 66 [[Squadron (cavalry)|squadrons]], 31 [[battalions]] and 38 guns and mortars totalling 21,000 men (16,000 of whom were [[Kingdom of England|English]] troops).&lt;ref name=chandler128&gt;Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander'',  p. 128. The initial force of 21,000 men were accompanied by 1,700 supply carts drawn by 5,000 draught horses. The artillery needed as many more.&lt;/ref&gt; This force was to be augmented ''en route'' such that by the time Marlborough reached the Danube, it would number 40,000 (47 battalions, 88 squadrons). Whilst Marlborough led his army, [[Henry de Nassau, Lord Overkirk|General Overkirk]] would maintain a defensive position in the [[Dutch Republic]] in case Villeroi mounted an attack. The Duke had assured the Dutch that if the French were to launch an offensive he would return in good time, but Marlborough calculated that as he marched south, the French commander would be drawn after him.&lt;ref&gt;Falkner: ''Blenheim 1704'', p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; In this assumption Marlborough was correct: Villeroi shadowed the Duke with 30,000 men in 60 squadrons and 42 battalions.&lt;ref&gt;Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander'',  p. 129. Barnett and Coxe states 45 squadrons and 36 battalions.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Battle of Blenheim - Joshua Ross jr.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The Battle of Blenheim by Joshua Ross.]]

The military dangers in such an enterprise were numerous: Marlborough's lines of communication along the Rhine would be hopelessly exposed to French interference, for Louis’ generals controlled the left bank of the river and its central reaches. Such a long march would almost certainly involve a high wastage of men and horses through exhaustion and disease. However, Marlborough was convinced of the urgency – &quot;I am very sensible that I take a great deal upon me&quot;, he had earlier written to Godolphin, &quot;but should I act otherwise, the Empire would be undone …&quot;&lt;ref name=chandler128/&gt;

Whilst Allied preparations had progressed, the French were striving to maintain and re-supply Marshal Marsin. Marsin had been operating with the Elector of Bavaria against the Imperial commander, Prince Louis of Baden, and was somewhat isolated from France: his only lines of communication lay through the rocky passes of the Black Forest. However, on 14 May, with considerable skill Marshal Tallard managed to bring 10,000 reinforcements and vast supplies and munitions through the difficult terrain, whilst outmanoeuvring Baron Thüngen, the Imperial general who sought to block his path.&lt;ref&gt;Falkner: ''Blenheim 1704'', p. 20. Falkner gives a total of 8,000&lt;/ref&gt; Tallard then returned with his own force to the Rhine, once again side-stepping Thüngen's efforts to intercept him. The whole operation was an outstanding military achievement.&lt;ref&gt;Falkner: ''Blenheim 1704'', p. 20, although Chandler p. 131 states that many men were lost on the return journey through desertion.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 May, Marlborough reached Coblenz, where the Moselle meets the Rhine. If he intended an attack along the Moselle the Duke must now turn west, but, instead, the following day the army crossed to the right bank of the Rhine, (pausing to add 5,000 waiting [[Hanoverians]] and [[Prussia]]ns).&lt;ref&gt;Tincey: ''Blenheim 1704: The Duke of Marlborough's Masterpiece'', p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;There will be no campaign on the Moselle&quot;, wrote Villeroi who had taken up a defensive position on the river, &quot;the English have all gone up into Germany.&quot;&lt;ref name=falkner22&gt;Falkner: ''Blenheim 1704'', p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; A second possible objective now occurred to the French – an Allied incursion into Alsace and an attack on the city of [[Strasbourg]]. Marlborough skillfully encouraged this apprehension by constructing bridges across the Rhine at [[Philippsburg]], a ruse that not only encouraged Villeroi to come to Tallard's aid in the defence of Alsace, but one that ensured the French plan to march on Vienna remained paralysed by uncertainty.&lt;ref&gt;Barnett: ''Marlborough'', p.  89&lt;/ref&gt;

With Villeroi shadowing Marlborough's every move, Dutch anticipation of an immediate French counter-offensive against their weakened position in the Netherlands thus proved illusory.&lt;ref name=chandler129&gt;Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander'', p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; In any case, Marlborough had promised to return to the Netherlands if a French attack developed there, transferring his troops down the Rhine on barges at a rate of 80 miles (130&amp;nbsp;km) a day.&lt;ref name=chandler129/&gt; Encouraged by this sense of security the [[States-General of the Netherlands|States-General]] promptly agreed to release the Danish contingent of  seven battalions and 22 squadrons as a reinforcement.&lt;ref name=chandler129/&gt; Marlborough reached [[Ladenburg]], in the plain of the Neckar and the Rhine, and there halted for three days to rest his cavalry and allow the guns and infantry to close up.&lt;ref&gt;Barnett: ''Marlborough'',  p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 June he arrived at [[Wiesloch]], south of [[Heidelberg]]. The following day, the Allied army swung away from the Rhine towards the hills of the [[Swabian Jura]] and the Danube beyond. At last Marlborough's destination was established without doubt.

===Strategy===
[[Image:Prinz-Eugen-von-Savoyen1.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Prince Eugene of Savoy]] (1663–1736) by [[Jacob van Schuppen]]. Prince Eugene met Marlborough for the first time in 1704. It was the start of a lifelong personal and professional friendship.]]

On 10 June, the Duke met for the first time the President of the Imperial War Council, Prince Eugene – accompanied by Count Wratislaw – at the village of [[Mundelsheim]], half-way between the Danube and the Rhine.&lt;ref&gt;Falkner: ''Blenheim 1704'', p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; By the 13 June, the Imperial Field Commander, Prince Louis of Baden, had joined them in [[Weinstadt|Großheppach]].&lt;ref&gt;Falkner: ''Blenheim 1704'', p. 25. Eugene had doubts about Baden's reliability, for he was a close friend of the Elector of Bavaria. It was even suspected that Baden was secretly corresponding with his old comrade.&lt;/ref&gt; The three generals commanded a force of nearly 110,000 men. At conference it was decided that Eugene would return with 28,000 men to the Lines of Stollhofen on the Rhine to keep an eye on Villeroi and Tallard, and prevent them going to the aid of the Franco-Bavarian army on the Danube. Meanwhile, Marlborough's and Baden's forces would combine, totalling 80,000 men, for the march on the Danube to seek out the Elector and Marsin before they could be reinforced.&lt;ref&gt;Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander'', p. 132&lt;/ref&gt;

Knowing Marlborough's destination, Tallard and Villeroi met at [[Landau]] in Alsace on 13 June to rapidly construct an action plan to save Bavaria, but the rigidity of the French command system was such that any variations from the original plan had to be sanctioned by [[Versailles]].&lt;ref name=Chandler1&gt;Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander'', p. 133&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Jean-Philippe-Eugène de Mérode-Westerloo|Count of Mérode-Westerloo]], commander of the [[Flemish people|Flemish]] troops in Tallard's army wrote – &quot;One thing is certain: we delayed our march from Alsace for far too long and quite inexplicably.&quot;&lt;ref name=Chandler1 /&gt; Approval from [[King Louis XIV|Louis]] arrived on 27 June: Tallard was to reinforce Marsin and the Elector on the Danube via the Black Forest, with 40 battalions and 50 squadrons; Villeroi was to pin down the Allies defending the Lines of Stollhofen, or, if the Allies should move all their forces to the Danube, he was to join with Marshal Tallard; and General de Coignies with 8,000 men, would protect Alsace. On 1 July Tallard's army of 35,000 re-crossed the Rhine at [[Kehl]] and began its march.&lt;ref name=Chandler1 /&gt;

Meanwhile, on 22 June, Marlborough's forces linked up with Baden's Imperial forces at Launsheim. A distance of 250 miles (400&amp;nbsp;km) had been covered in five weeks.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn p. 287. Lynn states that the march-rate was not unprecedented for the period, averaging 7.5 miles (12 km) per day. What stands out was the total distance, and the fine condition of the troops when they arrived.&lt;/ref&gt; Thanks to a carefully planned time-table, the effects of wear and tear had been kept to a minimum. Captain Parker described the march discipline – &quot;As we marched through the country of our Allies, commissars were appointed to furnish us with all manner of necessaries for man and horse … the soldiers had nothing to do but pitch their tents, boil kettles and lie down to rest.&quot;&lt;ref name=chandler131&gt;Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander'', p. 131. The Allied march had not been without loss: French spies reported that 900 sick had been left at [[Kassel]].&lt;/ref&gt; In response to Marlborough's manoeuvres, the Elector and Marsin, conscious of their numerical disadvantage with only 40,000 men, moved their forces to the entrenched camp at [[Dillingen an der Donau|Dillingen]] on the north bank of the Danube. Marlborough could not attack Dillingen because of a lack of siege guns – he was unable to bring any from the Low Countries, and Baden had failed to supply any despite assurances to the contrary.&lt;ref&gt;Falkner: ''Blenheim 1704'', p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Marlborough's assault on Schellenberg, 2 July 1704.gif|thumb|left|250px|Allied assault on the Schellenberg – taken by [[coup de main]] on 2 July – provided the Allies with an excellent river crossing.]]

The Allies, nevertheless, needed a base for provisions and a good river crossing. On 2 July, therefore, Marlborough  [[Battle of Schellenberg|stormed the key fortress of Schellenberg]] on the heights above the town of [[Donauwörth]]. [[Jean Baptist, Comte d'Arco|Count Jean d'Arco]] had been sent with 12,000 men from the Franco-Bavarian camp to hold the town and grassy hill, but after a ferocious and bloody battle, inflicting enormous casualties on both sides, Schellenberg finally succumbed, forcing Donauwörth to surrender shortly afterwards. The Elector, knowing his position at Dillingen was now not tenable, took up a position behind the strong fortifications of [[Augsburg]].&lt;ref&gt;Falkner: ''Blenheim 1704'', p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;

Tallard's march, meanwhile, presented a dilemma for Eugene. If the Allies were not to be outnumbered on the Danube, Eugene realised he must either try to cut Tallard off before he could get there, or, he must hasten to reinforce Marlborough.&lt;ref name=henderson103&gt;Henderson: ''Prince Eugen of Savoy'', p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; However, if he withdrew from the Rhine to the Danube, Villeroi might also make a move south to link up with the Elector and Marsin. Eugene compromised: leaving 12,000 troops behind guarding the Lines of Stollhofen, he marched off with the rest of his army to forestall Tallard.&lt;ref name=henderson103/&gt;

Lacking in numbers, Eugene could not seriously disrupt Tallard's march; nevertheless, the French Marshal's progress was proving pitifully slow. Tallard's force had suffered considerably more than Marlborough's troops on their march – many of his cavalry horses were suffering from [[glanders]], and the mountain passes were proving tough for the 2,000 wagons of provisions. Local German peasants, angry at French plundering, compounded Tallard's problems, leading Mérode-Westerloo to bemoan – &quot;the enraged peasantry killed several thousand of our men before the army was clear of the Black Forest.&quot;&lt;ref name=chandler131/&gt; Additionally, Tallard had insisted on besieging the little town of [[Villingen]] for six days (16–22 July), but abandoned the enterprise on discovering the approach of Eugene.

The Elector in Augsburg was informed on 14 July that Tallard was on his way through the Black Forest. This good news bolstered the Elector's policy of inaction, further encouraging him to wait for the reinforcements.&lt;ref&gt;Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander'', p. 139&lt;/ref&gt; But this reticence to fight induced Marlborough to undertake a controversial policy of spoliation in Bavaria, burning buildings and crops throughout the rich lands south of the Danube. This had two aims: firstly to put pressure on the Elector to fight or come to terms before Tallard arrived with reinforcements; and secondly, to ruin Bavaria as a base from which the French and Bavarian armies could attack Vienna, or pursue the Duke into [[Franconia]] if, at some stage, he had to withdraw northwards.&lt;ref&gt;Falkner: ''Blenheim 1704'', p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; But this destruction, coupled with a protracted siege of [[Rain (Lech)|Rain]] (9–16 July), caused Prince Eugene to lament &quot;… since the Donauwörth action I cannot admire their performances&quot;, and later to conclude &quot;If he has to go home without having achieved his objective, he will certainly be ruined.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Spencer: ''Blenheim: Battle for Europe'', p. 215&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, strategically the Duke had been able to place his numerically stronger forces between the Franco-Bavarian army and Vienna.

===Final positioning===
[[Image:Maneuvers before the Battle of Blenheim, 6-13 August 1704.gif|thumb|250px|[[Manoeuvre]]s before the battle 9–13 August.]]

Marshal Tallard, with 34,000 men, reached Ulm, joining with the Elector and Marsin in Augsburg on 5 August (although Tallard was not impressed to find that the Elector had dispersed his army in response to Marlborough's campaign of ravaging the region).&lt;ref&gt;Falkner: ''Blenheim 1704'', p. 44. Lynn states Tallard reached Augsburg on 3 August.&lt;/ref&gt; Also on 5 August, Eugene reached [[Höchstädt an der Donau|Höchstädt]], riding that same night to meet with Marlborough at [[Schrobenhausen]]. Marlborough knew it was necessary that another crossing point over the Danube would be required in case Donauwörth fell to the enemy. On 7 August, therefore, the first of Baden's 15,000 Imperial troops (the remainder following two days later) left Marlborough's main force to besiege the heavily defended city of [[Ingolstadt]], 20 miles (≈30&amp;nbsp;km) farther down the Danube.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes: ''Marlborough: England's Fragile Genius'' p. 279. Many reliable historians argue (as did Mérode-Westerloo at the time) that this was largely a device to get the 'cautious and obstructive Margrave out of the way'. However, Marlborough had assured Heinsius that the siege made perfect sense, and there is no direct evidence that they deliberately contrived his absence.&lt;/ref&gt;

With Eugene's forces at Höchstädt on the north bank of the Danube, and Marlborough's at Rain on the south bank, Tallard and the Elector debated their next move. Tallard preferred to bide his time, replenish supplies and allow Marlborough's Danube campaign to flounder in the colder weeks of Autumn; the Elector and Marsin, however, newly reinforced, were keen to push ahead. The French and Bavarian commanders eventually agreed on a plan and decided to attack Eugene's smaller force. On 9 August, the Franco-Bavarian forces began to cross to the north bank of the Danube.&lt;ref&gt;Falkner: ''Blenheim 1704'', p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 August, Eugene sent an urgent dispatch reporting that he was falling back to Donauwörth – &quot;The enemy have marched. It is almost certain that the whole army is crossing the Danube at [[Lauingen]] … The plain of Dillingen is crowded with troops … Everything, milord, consists in speed and that you put yourself forthwith in movement to join me tomorrow, without which I fear it will be too late.&quot; By a series of brilliant marches Marlborough concentrated his forces on Donauwörth and, by noon 11 August, the link-up was complete.&lt;ref name=chandler141&gt;Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander'', p. 141&lt;/ref&gt;

During 11 August, Tallard pushed forward from the river crossings at Dillingen; by 12 August, the Franco-Bavarian forces were encamped behind the small river Nebel near the village of Blenheim on the plain of Höchstädt. That same day Marlborough and Eugene carried out their own reconnaissance of the French position from the church spire at [[Tapfheim]], and moved their combined forces to Münster – five miles (8&amp;nbsp;km) from the French camp. A French reconnaissance under the [[Marquis de Silly]] went forward to probe the enemy, but were driven off by Allied troops who had deployed to cover the pioneers of the advancing army, labouring to bridge the numerous streams in the area and improve the passage leading westwards to Höchstädt.&lt;ref&gt;Churchill: ''Marlborough: His Life and Times'', p.  842. The French had captured four prisoners. Under examination they declared that the whole Allied army was going to move off towards Nördlingen the next morning.&lt;/ref&gt; Marlborough quickly moved forward two brigades under the command of General Wilkes and Brigadier Rowe to secure the narrow strip of land between the Danube and the wooded Fuchsberg hill, at the [[Schwenningen, Bavaria|Schwenningen]] defile.&lt;ref name=coxe188&gt;Coxe: ''Memoirs of the Duke of Marlborough: vol.i.''  p. 188&lt;/ref&gt;

Tallard's army numbered 56,000 men and 90 guns; the army of the [[Grand Alliance (League of Augsburg)|Grand Alliance]], 52,000 men and 66 guns. Some Allied officers who were acquainted with the superior numbers of the enemy, and aware of their strong defensive position, ventured to remonstrate with Marlborough about the hazards of attacking; but the Duke was resolute – &quot;I know the danger, yet a battle is absolutely necessary, and I rely on the bravery and discipline of the troops, which will make amends for our disadvantages&quot;.&lt;ref name=coxe188/&gt; Marlborough and Eugene decided to risk everything, and agreed to attack on the following day.

==Battle==
===The battlefield===
The battlefield stretched for nearly {{convert|4|mi|km}}. The extreme right flank of the Franco-Bavarian army was covered by the Danube; to the extreme left flank lay the undulating pine-covered hills of the Swabian Jura. A small stream, the Nebel, (the ground either side of which was soft and marshy and only fordable intermittently), fronted the French line. The French right rested on the village of Blenheim near where the Nebel flows into the Danube; the village itself was surrounded by hedges, fences, enclosed gardens, and meadows. Between Blenheim and the next village of [[Höchstädt an der Donau|Oberglauheim]] the fields of wheat had been cut to stubble and were now ideal to deploy troops. From Oberglauheim to the next hamlet of Lutzingen the terrain of ditches, thickets and brambles was potentially difficult ground for the attackers.&lt;ref&gt;Barnett: ''Marlborough'', p. 106&lt;/ref&gt;

===Initial manoeuvres===
[[Image:Battle of Blenhiem - Situation about noon, 13 August 1704.gif|thumb|250px|The position of the forces at noon, 13 August. Marlborough took control of the left arm of the Allied forces including the attacks on Blenheim and Oberglauheim, whilst Eugene commanded the right including the attacks on [[Lutzingen]].]]

At 02:00 on 13 August, 40 squadrons were sent forward towards the enemy, followed at 03:00, in eight columns, by the main Allied force pushing over the Kessel. At about 06:00 they reached Schwenningen, two miles (3&amp;nbsp;km) from Blenheim. The English and German troops who had held Schwenningen through the night joined the march, making a ninth column on the left of the army. Marlborough and Eugene made their final plans. The Allied commanders agreed that Marlborough would command 36,000 troops and attack Tallard's force of 33,000 on the left (including capturing the village of Blenheim), whilst Eugene, commanding 16,000 men would attack the Elector and Marsin's combined forces of 23,000 troops on the right wing; if this attack was pressed hard the Elector and Marsin would have no troops to send to aid Tallard on their right.&lt;ref&gt;Falkner: ''Blenheim 1704'', p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Cutts, 1st Baron Cutts|Lieutenant-General John Cutts]] would attack Blenheim in concert with Eugene's attack. With the French flanks busy, Marlborough could cross the Nebel and deliver the fatal blow to the French at their centre. However, Marlborough would have to wait until Eugene was in position before the general engagement could begin.

For Tallard, the very last thing he was expecting that morning was to be attacked by the Allies – deceived by intelligence gathered from prisoners taken by de Silly the previous day, and assured in their strong natural position, Tallard and his colleagues were convinced that Marlborough and Eugene were about to retreat north-eastwards towards [[Nördlingen]].&lt;ref&gt;Barnett: ''Marlborough'', p. 108. Several sources (Churchill, Chandler) suggest that Marlborough had planted this corroborative 'evidence' on Tallard.&lt;/ref&gt; Tallard wrote a report to this effect to King Louis that morning, but hardly had he sent the messenger when the Allied army began to appear opposite his camp.  &quot;I could see the enemy advancing ever closer in nine great columns&quot;, wrote Mérode-Westerloo, &quot; ... filling the whole plain from the Danube to the woods on the horizon.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Barnett: ''Marlborough'', p. 109&lt;/ref&gt; Signal guns were fired to bring in the foraging parties and [[picket (military)|picquet]]s as the French and Bavarian troops tried to draw into battle-order to face the unexpected threat.

At about 08:00 the French artillery on their right wing opened fire, answered by [[Holcroft Blood|Colonel Blood]]'s [[Artillery battery|batteries]].&lt;ref&gt;Churchill states 08:30&lt;/ref&gt; The guns were heard by Baden in his camp before Ingolstadt, &quot;The Prince and the Duke are engaged today to the westward&quot;, he wrote to the Emperor. &quot;Heaven bless them.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Churchill: ''Marlborough: His Life and Times'', p. 848&lt;/ref&gt; An hour later Tallard, the Elector, and Marsin climbed Blenheim's church tower to finalise their plans. It was settled that the Elector and Marsin would hold the front from the hills to Oberglauheim, whilst Tallard would defend the ground between Oberglauheim and the Danube. The French commanders were, however, divided as to how to utilise the Nebel: Tallard's tactic – opposed by Marsin and the Elector who felt it better to close their infantry right up to the stream itself – was to lure the allies across before unleashing their cavalry upon them, causing panic and confusion; whilst the enemy was struggling in the marshes, they would be caught in crossfire from Blenheim and Oberglauheim. The plan was sound if all its parts were implemented, but it allowed Marlborough to cross the Nebel without serious interference and fight the battle he had in mind.&lt;ref&gt;Falkner: ''Blenheim 1704'', p. 58&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deployment===
The Franco-Bavarian commanders deployed their forces. In the village of Lutzingen, Count Maffei positioned five Bavarian battalions with a great battery of 16 guns at the village's edge. In the woods to the left of Lutzingen, seven French battalions under the Marquis de Rozel moved into place. Between Lutzingen and Oberglauheim the Elector placed 27 squadrons of cavalry – Count d'Arco commanded 14 Bavarian squadrons and Count Wolframsdorf had 13 more in support nearby. To their right stood Marsin's 40 French squadrons and 12 battalions. The village of Oberglauheim was packed with 14 battalions commanded by the Marquis de Blainville (including the effective Irish Brigade known as the '[[Flight of the Wild Geese|Wild Geese]]'). Six batteries of guns were ranged alongside the village.&lt;ref name=falkner61&gt;Falkner: ''Blenheim 1704'', p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; On the right of these French and Bavarian positions, between Oberglauheim and Blenheim, Tallard deployed 64 French and Walloon squadrons (16 drawn from Marsin) supported by nine French battalions standing near the Höchstädt road. In the cornfield next to Blenheim stood three battalions from the Regiment de Roi. Nine battalions occupied the village itself, commanded by the Marquis de Clérambault. Four battalions stood to the rear and a further 11 were in reserve. These battalions were supported by Hautefeuille's 12 squadrons of dismounted dragoons.&lt;ref name=falkner61 /&gt; By 11:00 Tallard, the Elector, and Marsin were in place. Many of the Allied generals were hesitant to attack such a relatively strong position. The [[George Douglas-Hamilton, 1st Earl of Orkney|Earl of Orkney]] later confessed that, &quot;had I been asked to give my opinion, I had been against it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Falkner: ''Blenheim 1704'', p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;

Prince Eugene was expected to be in position by 11:00, but due to the difficult terrain and enemy fire, progress was slow.&lt;ref&gt;Falkner: ''Blenheim 1704'', p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; Lord Cutts’ column – who by 10:00 had expelled the enemy from two water mills upon the Nebel – had already deployed by the river against Blenheim, enduring over the next three hours severe fire from a heavy six-gun battery posted near the village. The rest of Marlborough's army, waiting in their ranks on the forward slope, were also forced to bear the cannonade from the French artillery, suffering 2,000 casualties before the attack could even be begun.&lt;ref&gt;Churchill: ''Marlborough: His Life and Times'', p.  852&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile engineers repaired a stone bridge across the Nebel, and constructed five additional bridges or causeways across the marsh between Blenheim and Oberglauheim. Marlborough's anxiety was finally allayed when, just past noon, [[William Cadogan, 1st Earl Cadogan|Colonel Cadogan]] reported that Eugene's [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] and [[Denmark|Danish]] infantry were in place – the order for the general advance was given. At 13:00, Cutts was ordered to attack the village of Blenheim whilst Prince Eugene was requested to assault Lutzingen on the Allied right flank.&lt;ref&gt;Falkner: ''Blenheim 1704'', p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;

===Blenheim===
[[Image:Battle of Blenheim Tapestry.jpg|thumb|250px|Part of the Battle of Blenheim tapestry at [[Blenheim Palace]] by [[Judocus de Vos]]. In the background is the village of [[Blindheim|Blenheim]]; in the middle ground are the two water mills that Rowe had to take to gain a bridgehead over the Nebel. The foreground shows an English grenadier with a captured French colour.]]

Cutts ordered Brigadier-General Archibald Rowe's brigade to attack. The English infantry rose from the edge of the Nebel, and silently marched towards Blenheim, a distance of some 150 yards (~130 metres). John Ferguson's English brigade supported Rowe's left, and moved in perfect order towards the barricades between the village and the river, defended by Hautefeuille's dragoons. As the range closed to within {{convert|30|yd}}, the French fired a deadly volley. Rowe had ordered that there should be no firing from his men until he struck his sword upon the [[palisade]]s, but as he stepped forward to give the signal, he fell mortally wounded.&lt;ref&gt;Churchill: ''Marlborough: His Life and Times'', p.  853. Two of Rowe's staff officers were killed trying to carry him away: Lieutenant-Colonel Dalyell and Major Campbell.&lt;/ref&gt; The survivors of the leading companies closed up the gaps in their torn ranks and rushed forward. Small parties penetrated the defences, but repeated French volleys forced the English back towards the Nebel, sustaining heavy casualties. As the attack faltered, eight squadrons of elite Gens d'Armes, commanded by the veteran Swiss officer, Beat-Jacques von Zurlauben, fell upon the English troops, cutting at the exposed flank of [[Royal Scots Fusiliers|Rowe's own regiment]].&lt;ref&gt;Churchill and Coxe states only three squadrons of Gens d'Armes. Rowe's own regiment lost their colours, but they were soon retrieved by the Hessians.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Wilkes’ [[Hesse|Hessian]] brigade, lying nearby in the marshy grass at the water's edge, stood firm and repulsed the Gens d'Armes with steady fire, enabling the English and Hessians to re-order and launch another attack.&lt;ref&gt;Falkner: ''Blenheim 1704'', p. 68&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Allies were again repulsed, these persistent attacks on Blenheim eventually bore fruit, panicking Clérambault into making the worst French error of the day.&lt;ref name=chandler145&gt;Chandler: ''A Guide to the Battlefields of Europe'', p. 145&lt;/ref&gt; Without consulting Tallard, Clérambault ordered his reserve battalions into the village, upsetting the balance of the French position and nullifying the French numerical superiority. &quot;The men were so crowded in upon one another&quot;, wrote Mérode-Westerloo, &quot;that they couldn’t even fire – let alone receive or carry out any orders.&quot;&lt;ref name=chandler145/&gt; Marlborough, spotting this error, now countermanded Cutts’ intention to launch a third attack, and ordered him simply to contain the enemy within Blenheim; no more than 5,000 Allied soldiers were able to pen in twice the number of French infantry and dragoons.&lt;ref&gt;Falkner: ''Blenheim 1704'', p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lutzingen===
:'' … Prince Eugene and the Imperial troops had been repulsed three times – driven right back to the woods – and had taken a real drubbing.'' – Mérode-Westerloo.&lt;ref&gt;Spencer: ''Blenheim: Battle for Europe'', p. 270&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Spanischer Erbfolgekrieg 1704, Lutzingen, Germany.jpg|left|thumb|150px|Memorial for the Battle of Blenheim 1704, [[Lutzingen]], Germany.]]

On the Allied right, Eugene's Prussian and Danish forces were desperately fighting the numerically superior forces of the Elector and Marsin. The [[Leopold I, Prince of Anhalt-Dessau|Prince of Anhalt-Dessau]] led forward four brigades across the Nebel to assault the well-fortified position of Lutzingen. Here, the Nebel was less of an obstacle, but the great battery positioned on the edge of the village enjoyed a good field of fire across the open ground stretching to the hamlet of Schwennenbach. As soon as the infantry crossed the stream, they were struck by Maffei's infantry, and salvoes from the Bavarian guns positioned both in front of the village and in [[Enfilade and defilade|enfilade]] on the wood-line to the right. Despite heavy casualties the Prussians attempted to storm the great battery, whilst the Danes, under Count Scholten, attempted to drive the French infantry out of the copses beyond the village.&lt;ref&gt;Falkner: ''Blenheim 1704'', p. 71&lt;/ref&gt;

With the infantry heavily engaged, Eugene's cavalry picked its way across the Nebel. After an initial success, his first line of cavalry, under the Imperial General of Horse, [[Maximilian Wilhelm of Brunswick-Lüneburg|Prince Maximilian of Hanover]], were pressed by the second line of Marsin's cavalry, and were forced back across the Nebel in confusion. Nevertheless, the exhausted French were unable to follow up their advantage, and the two cavalry forces tried to regroup and reorder their ranks.&lt;ref&gt;Tincey: ''Blenheim 1704: The Duke of Marlborough's Masterpiece'', p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; However, without cavalry support, and threatened with envelopment, the Prussian and Danish infantry were in turn forced to pull back across the Nebel. Panic gripped some of Eugene's troops as they crossed the stream. Ten infantry colours were lost to the Bavarians, and hundreds of prisoners taken; it was only through the leadership of Eugene and the Prussian Prince that the Imperialist infantry were prevented from abandoning the field.&lt;ref&gt;Spencer: ''Blenheim: Battle for Europe'', p. 268&lt;/ref&gt;

After rallying his troops near Schwennenbach – well beyond their starting point – Eugene prepared to launch a second attack, led by the second-line squadrons under the [[Eberhard Ludwig, Duke of Württemberg|Duke of Württemberg-Teck]]. Yet again they were caught in the murderous cross-fire from the artillery in Lutzingen and Oberglauheim, and were once again thrown back in disarray. The French and Bavarians, however, were almost as disordered as their opponents, and they too were in need of inspiration from their commander, the Elector, who was seen – &quot; … riding up and down, and inspiring his men with fresh courage.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Falkner: ''Blenheim 1704'', p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; Anhalt-Dessau's Danish and Prussian infantry attacked a second time but could not sustain the advance without proper support. Once again they fell back across the stream.

===Centre and Oberglauheim===
:'' … they began to pass [the marshes and the Nebel] as fast as the badness of the ground would permit them.'' –  Churchill's chaplain.&lt;ref&gt;Spencer: ''Blenheim: Battle for Europe'', p. 258&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Camille d'Hostun duc de Tallard.png|thumb|150px|[[Camille d'Hostun, duc de Tallard|Marshal Tallard]] (1652–1728). He should not have allowed Clérambault to shut most of the infantry of the French right wing into Blenheim, leaving him short of infantry support when it most mattered.]]

Whilst these events around Blenheim and Lutzingen were taking place, Marlborough was preparing to cross the Nebel. The centre, commanded by the Duke's brother, General Charles Churchill, consisted of 18 battalions of infantry arranged in two lines: seven battalions in the front line to secure a foothold across the Nebel, and 11 battalions in the rear providing cover from the Allied side of the stream. Between the infantry were placed two lines, 72 squadrons of cavalry. The first line of foot was to pass the stream first and march as far to the other side as could be conveniently done. This line would then form and cover the passage of the horse, leaving gaps in the line of infantry large enough for the cavalry to pass through and take their position in front.

Marlborough ordered the formation forward. Once again Zurlauben's Gens d'Armes charged, looking to rout [[Henry Lumley|Lumley]]'s English cavalry who linked Cutts' column facing Blenheim with Churchill's infantry. As these elite French cavalry attacked, they were faced by five English squadrons under Colonel Francis Palmes. To the consternation of the French, the Gens d'Armes were pushed back in terrible confusion, pursued well beyond the Maulweyer stream that flows through Blenheim.&lt;ref name =falkner76&gt;Falkner: ''Blenheim 1704'', p. 76. In his account after the battle, Tallard explains his defeat – &quot;first, because the Gendarmerie were not able to break the five English squadrons.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;What? Is it possible?&quot; exclaimed the Elector, &quot;the gentlemen of France fleeing?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Churchill: ''Marlborough: His Life and Times'', p.  856&lt;/ref&gt; Palmes, however, attempted to follow up his success but was repulsed in some confusion by other French cavalry, and musketry fire from the edge of Blenheim.&lt;ref name=falkner76/&gt;

Nevertheless, Tallard was alarmed by the repulse of the elite Gens d'Armes and urgently rode across the field to ask Marsin for reinforcements; but on the basis of being hard pressed by Eugene – whose second attack was in full flood – Marsin refused.&lt;ref name=falkner77&gt;Falkner: ''Blenheim 1704'', p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; As Tallard consulted with Marsin, more of his infantry was being taken into Blenheim by Clérambault. Fatally, Tallard, aware of the situation, did nothing to rectify this grave mistake, leaving him with just the nine battalions of infantry near the Höchstädt road
to oppose the massed enemy ranks in the centre.&lt;ref name=falkner77/&gt; Zurlauben tried several more times to disrupt the Allies forming on Tallard's side of the stream; his front-line cavalry darting forward down the gentle slope towards the Nebel. But the attacks lacked co-ordination, and the Allied infantry's steady volleys disconcerted the French horsemen.&lt;ref&gt;Falkner: ''Blenheim 1704'', p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; During these skirmishes Zurlauben fell mortally wounded, and died two days later. The time was just after 15:00.
[[File:Allied attack on Oberglau.png|thumb|left|250px|Allied attack on [[Höchstädt an der Donau|Oberglauheim]].]]

The Danish cavalry, under the Duke of Württemberg-Öels (not to be confused with the Duke of Württemberg who fought with Eugene), had made slow work of crossing the Nebel near Oberglau; harassed by Marsin's infantry near the village, the Danes were driven back across the stream. Count Horn's Dutch infantry managed to push the French back from the water's edge, but it was apparent that before Marlborough could launch his main effort against Tallard, Oberglauheim would have to be secured.

Count Horn directed the [[Prince of Holstein-Beck]] to take the village, but his two Dutch brigades were cut down by the French and Irish troops, capturing and mortally wounding the Prince during the action.&lt;ref&gt;Spencer: ''Blenheim: Battle for Europe'', p. 264&lt;/ref&gt; The battle was now in the balance. If Holstein-Beck's Dutch column were destroyed, the Allied army would be split in two: Eugene's wing would be isolated from Marlborough's, passing the initiative to the Franco-Bavarian forces now engaged across the whole plain.&lt;ref&gt;Falkner: ''Blenheim 1704'', p. 80. Tallard later recorded – &quot;At this moment I saw the hope of victory.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Seeing the opportunity, Marsin ordered his cavalry to change from facing Eugene, and turn towards their right and the open flank of Churchill's infantry drawn up in front of Unterglau. Marlborough (who had crossed the Nebel on a makeshift bridge to take personal control), ordered Hulsen's Hanoverian battalions to support the Dutch infantry. A Dutch cavalry brigade under Averock was also called forward but soon came under pressure from Marsin's more numerous squadrons.

Marlborough now requested Eugene to release Count Hendrick Fugger and his Imperial Cuirassier brigade to help repel the French cavalry thrust. Despite his own desperate struggle, the Imperial Prince at once complied, demonstrating the high degree of confidence and mutual co-operation between the two generals.&lt;ref&gt;Chandler: ''A Guide to the Battlefields of Europe'', p. 161&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Nebel stream lay between Fugger's and Marsin's squadrons, the French were forced to change front to meet this new threat, thus forestalling the chance for Marsin to strike at Marlborough's infantry.&lt;ref&gt;Falkner: ''Blenheim 1704'', p. 81&lt;/ref&gt; Fugger's [[cuirassiers]] charged and, striking at a favourable angle, threw back Marsin's squadrons in disorder.&lt;ref&gt;Churchill: ''Marlborough: His Life and Times'', p. 858&lt;/ref&gt; With support from Colonel Blood's batteries, the Hessian, Hanoverian and Dutch infantry – now commanded by Count Berensdorf – succeeded in pushing the French and Irish infantry back into Oberglauheim so that they could not again threaten Churchill's flank as he moved against Tallard. The French commander in the village, the Marquis de Blainville, numbered amongst the heavy casualties.&lt;ref name=falkner82&gt;Falkner: ''Blenheim 1704'', p. 82&lt;/ref&gt;

===Breakthrough===
:''The [French] foot remained in the best order I ever saw, till they were cut to pieces almost in rank and file.'' – [[George Hamilton, 1st Earl of Orkney|Lord Orkney]].&lt;ref name=falkner86&gt;Falkner: ''Blenheim 1704'', p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Battle of Blenheim - Penetration, 1730, 13 August 1704.gif|thumb|250px|Breakthrough: Position of the battle at 17:30.]]

By 16:00, with the enemy troops besieged in Blenheim and Oberglau, the Allied centre of 81 squadrons (nine squadrons had been transferred from Cutts' column), supported by 18 battalions was firmly planted amidst the French line of 64 squadrons and nine battalions of raw recruits. There was now a pause in the battle: Marlborough wanted to concert the attack upon the whole front, and Eugene, after his second repulse, needed time to reorganize.&lt;ref&gt;Churchill: ''Marlborough: His Life and Times'', p. 860&lt;/ref&gt;

Just after 17:00 all was ready along the Allied front. Marlborough's two lines of cavalry had now moved to the front of the Duke's line of battle, with the two supporting lines of infantry behind them. [[Jean-Philippe-Eugène de Mérode-Westerloo|Mérode-Westerloo]] attempted to extricate some French infantry crowded in Blenheim, but Clérambault ordered the troops back into the village. The French cavalry exerted themselves once more against the first line – Lumley's English and Scots on the Allied left, and Hompesch's Dutch and German squadrons on the Allied right. Tallard's squadrons, lacking infantry support, were tired and ragged but managed to push the Allied first line back to their infantry support. With the battle still not won, Marlborough had to rebuke one of his cavalry officers who was attempting to leave the field – &quot;Sir, you are under a mistake, the enemy lies that way … &quot;&lt;ref name=falkner86 /&gt; Now, at the Duke's command, the second Allied line under von Bulow and the Count of Ost-Friese was ordered forward, and, driving through the centre, the Allies finally put Tallard's tired horse to rout. With their cavalry in headlong flight, the remaining nine French infantry battalions fought with desperate valour, trying to form square.&lt;ref name=falkner86 /&gt; But it was futile. The French battalions were overwhelmed by Colonel Blood's close-range artillery and platoon fire. Mérode-Westerloo later wrote – &quot;[They] died to a man where they stood, stationed right out in the open plain – supported by nobody.&quot;&lt;ref name=falkner86 /&gt;

The majority of Tallard's retreating troops headed for Höchstädt but most did not make the safety of the town, plunging instead into the Danube where upwards of 3,000 French horsemen drowned;&lt;ref&gt;Churchill states up to 2,000&lt;/ref&gt; others were cut down by the pursuing cavalry. The Marquis de Gruignan attempted a counter-attack, but he was easily brushed aside by the triumphant Allies. After a final rally behind his camp's tents, shouting entreaties to stand and fight, Marshal Tallard was caught up in the rout and pushed towards Sonderheim.&lt;ref name=falkner90&gt;Falkner: ''Blenheim 1704'', p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; Surrounded by a squadron of [[Hesse|Hessian]] troops, Tallard surrendered to Lieutenant-Colonel de Boinenburg, the [[Frederick I of Sweden|Prince of Hesse-Kassel]]'s ''[[aide-de-camp]]'', and was sent under escort to Marlborough.&lt;ref&gt;Tincey: ''Blenheim 1704: The Duke of Marlborough's Masterpiece'', p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; The Duke welcomed the French commander – &quot;I am very sorry that such a cruel misfortune should have fallen upon a soldier for whom I have the highest regard.&quot; With salutes and courtesies, the Marshal was escorted to Marlborough's coach.&lt;ref name=falkner90/&gt;

===Fall of Blenheim===
:'' … our men fought in and through the fire … until many on both sides were burned to death.'' – Private Deane, [[Grenadier Guards|1st Regiment Foot Guards]].&lt;ref&gt;Spencer: ''Blenheim: Battle for Europe'', p. 294&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Battle of Blenhiem - Explotation, 13 August 1704.gif|left|thumb|250px|[[Pursuit]]]]

Meanwhile the Allies had once again attacked the Bavarian stronghold at Lutzingen.
Eugene, however, became exasperated with the performance of his Imperial cavalry whose third attack had failed: he had already shot two of his troopers to prevent a general flight. Then, declaring in disgust that he wished to &quot;fight among brave men and not among cowards&quot;, Eugene went into the attack with the Prussian and Danish infantry, as did the Dessauer, waving a regimental colour to inspire his troops.&lt;ref&gt;McKay: ''Prince Eugene of Savoy'', p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; This time the Prussians were able to storm the great Bavarian battery, and overwhelm the guns' crews.&lt;ref&gt;Falkner: ''Blenheim 1704'', p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond the village, Scholten's Danes defeated the French infantry in a desperate hand-to-hand bayonet struggle.&lt;ref&gt;Danish infantry suffered 2,401 casualties fighting for possession of the woods beyond Lutzingen (Falkner)&lt;/ref&gt; When they saw that the centre had broken, the Elector and Marsin decided the battle was lost and, like the remnants of Tallard's army, fled the battlefield (albeit in better order than Tallard's men). Attempts to organise an Allied force to prevent Marsin's withdrawal failed owing to the exhaustion of the cavalry, and the growing confusion in the field.

Marlborough now had to turn his attention from the fleeing enemy to direct Churchill to detach more infantry to storm Blenheim. Orkney's infantry, Hamilton's English brigade and St Paul's Hanoverians moved across the trampled wheat to the cottages. Fierce hand-to-hand fighting gradually forced the French towards the village centre, in and around the walled churchyard which had been prepared for defence. Hay and Ross's dismounted dragoons were also sent, but suffered under a counter-charge delivered by the regiments of Artois and Provence under command of Colonel de la Silvière. Colonel Belville's Hanoverians were fed into the battle to steady the resolve of the dragoons, and once more went to the attack. The Allied progress was slow and hard, and like the defenders, they suffered many casualties.&lt;ref&gt;Falkner: ''Blenheim 1704'', p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Battle of Blenheim Diorama.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Diorama]] of the battle in the Höchstädt museum. In the middle ground the Allied cavalry are breaking through, pushing Tallard's squadrons from the battlefield. The foreground depicts the fierce fighting in and around Blenheim.]]

Many of the cottages were now burning, obscuring the field of fire and driving the defenders out of their positions. Hearing the din of battle in Blenheim, Tallard sent a message to Marlborough offering to order the garrison to withdraw from the field.
&quot;Inform Monsieur Tallard&quot;, replied the Duke, &quot;that, in the position in which he is now, he has no command.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Churchill: ''Marlborough: His Life and Times'', p. 865&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, as dusk came the Allied commander was anxious for a quick conclusion. The French infantry fought tenaciously to hold on to their position in Blenheim, but their commander was nowhere to be found. Clérambault's insistence on confining his huge force in the village was to seal his fate that day.&lt;ref&gt;Spencer: ''Blenheim: Battle for Europe'', p. 291&lt;/ref&gt; Realising his tactical mistake had contributed to Tallard's defeat in the centre, Clérambault deserted Blenheim and the 27 battalions defending the village, and reportedly drowned in the Danube while attempting to make his escape.

By now Blenheim was under assault from every side by three English generals: Cutts, Churchill, and Orkney. The French had repulsed every attack with heavy slaughter, but many had seen what had happened on the plain and what its consequences to them would be; their army was routed and they were cut off.&lt;ref&gt;Churchill: ''Marlborough: His Life and Times'', p. 867&lt;/ref&gt; Orkney, attacking from the rear, now tried a different tactic – &quot;… it came into my head to beat parley&quot;, he later wrote, &quot;which they accepted of and immediately their Brigadier de Nouville capitulated with me to be prisoner at discretion and lay down their arms.&quot; Threatened by Allied guns, other units followed their example. However, it was not until 21:00 that the Marquis de Blanzac, who had taken charge in Clérambault's absence, reluctantly accepted the inevitability of defeat, and some 10,000 of France's best infantry had laid down their arms.&lt;ref&gt;Falkner: ''Blenheim 1704'', p. 98&lt;/ref&gt;

During these events Marlborough was still in the saddle conducting the pursuit of the broken enemy. Pausing for a moment he scribbled on the back of an old tavern bill a note addressed to his wife, [[Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough|Sarah]]: &quot;I have no time to say more but to beg you will give my duty to the Queen, and let her know her army has had a glorious victory.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Barnett: ''Marlborough'', p. 121. The message was carried to London by Colonel Daniel Parke.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
French losses were immense: over 30,000 killed, wounded and missing.&lt;ref name=barnett122&gt;Barnett: ''Marlborough'', p. 122&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the myth of French invincibility had been destroyed and Louis's hopes of an early and victorious peace had been wrenched from his grasp.&lt;ref name=barnett122/&gt; Mérode-Westerloo summarised the case against Tallard's army: &quot;The French lost this battle for a wide variety of reasons. For one thing they had too good an opinion of their own ability … Another point was their faulty field dispositions, and in addition there was rampant indiscipline and inexperience displayed … It took all these faults to lose so celebrated a battle.&quot;&lt;ref name=Chandler149&gt;Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander'',  p. 149&lt;/ref&gt; It was a hard-fought contest, leading Prince Eugene to observe – &quot;I have not a squadron or battalion which did not charge four times at least.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Falkner: ''Blenheim 1704'', p. 103&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless, the Battle of Blenheim was probably the most decisive victory of the war; Marlborough and Eugene, working indivisibly together, had saved the Habsburg Empire and thereby preserved the Grand Alliance from collapse.&lt;ref&gt;McKay: ''Prince Eugene of Savoy'', p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; [[Munich]], Augsburg, Ingolstadt, Ulm and all remaining territory of Bavaria soon fell to the Allies. By the [[Treaty of Ilbersheim]], signed 7 November 1704, Bavaria was placed under Austrian military rule, allowing the Habsburgs to utilise its resources for the rest of the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn: ''The Wars of Louis XIV, 1667–1714'', p. 293&lt;/ref&gt;

The remnants of the [[Maximilian II Emanuel, elector of Bavaria|Elector of Bavaria's]] and Marshal Marsin's wing limped back to Strasbourg, losing another 7,000 men through desertion.&lt;ref name=Chandler149/&gt; Despite being offered the chance to remain as ruler of Bavaria (under strict terms of an alliance with Austria), the Elector left his country and family in order to continue the war against the Allies from the Spanish Netherlands where he still held the post of governor-general. Their commander-in-chief that day, Marshal Tallard  – who, unlike his subordinates, had not been ransomed or exchanged – was taken to England and imprisoned in [[Nottingham]] until his release in 1711.&lt;ref name=Tincey1&gt;Tincey: ''Blenheim 1704: The Duke of Marlborough's Masterpiece'', p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1704 campaign lasted considerably longer than usual as the Allies sought to wring out maximum advantage. Realising that France was too powerful to be forced to make peace by a single victory, however, Eugene, Marlborough and Baden met to plan their next moves. For the following year the Duke proposed a campaign along the valley of the River Moselle to carry the war deep into France. This required the capture of the major fortress of Landau which guarded the Rhine, and the towns of Trier and Trarbach on the Moselle itself.&lt;ref name=Tincey1/&gt; Trier was taken on 26 October and Landau fell on 23 November to the Margrave of Baden and Prince Eugene; with the fall of Trarbach on 20 December, the campaign season for 1704 came to an end.

Marlborough was invited to Amsterdam and arrived on 10 December. [[Abraham Storck]] made a drawing or a painting of the occasion. He met with [[burgemeester]] [[Nicolaes Witsen]] and stayed in his house on the [[Gouden Bocht]]. Two days later he went to the Hague to meet [[Anthonie Heinsius]] and [[Simon van Slingelandt]]. In the afternoon end he went to Rotterdam to have himself painted by [[Adriaen van der Werff]].&lt;ref&gt;Hoff, B. van 't (1955) Article on the visit of the Duke to Rotterdam, p. 113.

In February 1705, Queen Anne, who had made Marlborough a Duke in 1702, granted him the [[Woodstock, Oxfordshire|Park of Woodstock]] and promised a sum of £240,000 to build a suitable [[Blenheim Palace|house]] as a gift from a grateful crown in recognition of his victory – a victory which British historian Sir [[Edward Creasy]] considered one of the pivotal battles in history, writing – &quot;Had it not been for Blenheim, all Europe might at this day suffer under the effect of French conquests resembling those of [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]] in extent and those of the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] in durability.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Edward Shepherd Creasy, [[The Fifteen Decisive Battles of the World]], 1851&lt;/ref&gt;

To this day, [[Blenheim Palace]] is the one of the few British residences denominated a &quot;palace&quot; which does not belong to royalty.  It is still the seat of the [[Duke of Marlborough]].

{{Campaignbox War of the Spanish Succession}}

The '''Battle of Ramillies''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|r|æ|m|ɪ|l|iː|z}}) was a major engagement of the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] fought on 23 May 1706. The encounter was a resounding success for the allied forces of the [[Dutch Republic]], [[Kingdom of England|England]], and their auxiliaries;&lt;ref&gt;Denmark remained neutral throughout the war, but Danish troops, hired by the Maritime Powers, were central to Allied success at both Blenhiem and Ramillies.&lt;/ref&gt; but the battle had followed a year of indecisive campaigning in 1705 where Allied over-confidence and Dutch hesitancy after their success at the [[Battle of Blenheim]] had resulted in an abortive campaign along the [[Moselle River|Moselle]], forcing the [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|Duke of Marlborough]] to abandon his plans for a push into France. Yet despite the Allies' inability to achieve a decisive victory, [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] was eager for peace; but he wanted it on reasonable terms. Therefore, rather than standing on the defensive, French armies on all fronts swung over to the offensive.

The year 1706 had begun well for Louis XIV's generals, who had gained early success in Italy and in [[Alsace]], where Marshal [[Claude Louis Hector de Villars|Villars]] had forced the [[Louis William, Margrave of Baden-Baden|Margrave of Baden]] to retreat across the [[Rhine]]. Louis now pressed Marshal [[François de Neufville, duc de Villeroi|Villeroi]] to seek out Marlborough and bring the Allies to battle in the [[Southern Netherlands|Spanish Netherlands]]. Accordingly, the French Marshal set off from [[Leuven]] (''Louvain'') at the head of 60,000 men, and provocatively marched towards [[Zoutleeuw]] (''Léau''). Marlborough, also determined to fight a major engagement, assembled his forces – some 62,000 men – near [[Maastricht]], before advancing towards the [[Mehaigne]] river and the plain of Ramillies where the French, in expectation of battle, had already formed their lines.

In less than four hours, Villeroi's army was utterly defeated. Marlborough's subtle moves and changes in emphasis during the battle – something the French and [[Kingdom of Bavaria|Bavarian]] commanders failed to realise until it was too late – caught his foe in a tactical &lt;!-- VICE/VISE spelling: please note that this article is using British spelling and Vice is therefore the correct spelling --&gt;vice. The Franco-Bavarian army broke and ran ''en masse'', suffering over 20,000 casualties. With Prince Eugene's subsequent success at [[Battle of Turin|Turin]] in northern Italy, the Allies had imposed the greatest loss of territory and resources that Louis XIV would suffer during the war. Town after town – including [[Brussels]], [[Bruges]] and [[Antwerp]] – fell to Marlborough's forces and by the end of the campaign, the Franco-Spanish army had been driven from most of the Spanish Netherlands. The year 1706 had indeed proved to be the Allies' ''[[annus mirabilis]]''.

==Background==
After their disastrous defeat at [[Battle of Blenheim|Blenheim]] in 1704, the next year brought France some respite. The [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|Duke of Marlborough]] had intended the 1705 campaign – an invasion of France through the [[Moselle River|Moselle]] valley – to complete the work of Blenheim and persuade [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] to make peace, but the plan had been thwarted by both friend and foe alike.&lt;ref name=barnett140&gt;Barnett: ''Marlborough,'' p. 140&lt;/ref&gt;

The reluctance of his Dutch allies to see their frontiers denuded of troops for another gamble in Germany had denied Marlborough the initiative,&lt;ref name=barnett140/&gt; but of far greater importance was  the [[Louis William, Margrave of Baden-Baden|Margrave of Baden]]’s pronouncement that he could not join the Duke in strength for the coming offensive. This was in part due to the sudden switching of troops from the Rhine to reinforce  [[Prince Eugene of Savoy|Prince Eugene]] in Italy, and part due to the deterioration of Baden’s health brought on by the re-opening of a severe foot wound he had received at the [[Battle of Schellenberg|storming of the Schellenberg]] the previous year.&lt;ref name=chandler154&gt;Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander,'' p. 154&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Marlborough had to cope with the death of  [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Leopold I]] in May and the accession of [[Joseph I, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph I]], which unavoidably complicated matters for the Grand Alliance.&lt;ref name=chandler154/&gt;

The resilience of the French King, and the efforts of his generals, also added to Marlborough’s problems.&lt;ref&gt;Falkner: ''Ramillies 1706: Year of Miracles,'' p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; Marshal [[François de Neufville, duc de Villeroi|Villeroi]], exerting considerable pressure on the Dutch commander, Count [[Henry de Nassau, Lord Overkirk|Overkirk]], along the [[Meuse River|Meuse]], took [[Huy]] on 10 June before pressing on towards [[Liège (city)|Liège]]. With Marshal Villars sitting strong on the [[Moselle]], the Allied commander – whose supplies had by now become critical – was forced to call off his campaign on 16 June. &quot;What a disgrace for Marlborough,&quot; exulted Villeroi, &quot;to have made false movements without any result!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander,'' p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; With Marlborough’s departure north, the French now transferred troops from the Moselle valley to reinforce Villeroi in Flanders, whilst Villars marched off to the [[Rhine]].&lt;ref&gt;Lynn: ''The Wars of Louis XIV, 1667–1714,'' p. 298&lt;/ref&gt;

The Anglo-Dutch forces gained minor compensation for the failed Moselle campaign with the success at [[Battle of Elixheim|Elixheim]] and the crossing of the [[Lines of Brabant]] in the Spanish Netherlands (Huy was also retaken on 11 July), but due to considerable Dutch hesitancy and reluctance, a chance to bring the French to a decisive engagement had eluded Marlborough.&lt;ref&gt;Barnett: ''Marlborough,''  p. 152&lt;/ref&gt; The year 1705 proved almost entirely barren for the Duke whose military disappointments were only partly compensated by efforts on the diplomatic front where, at the courts of [[Düsseldorf]], [[Frankfurt]], [[Vienna]], [[Berlin]] and [[Hanover]], Marlborough sought to bolster support for the Grand Alliance and extract promises of prompt assistance for the following year’s campaign.&lt;ref&gt;Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander,'' p. 164&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prelude==
On 11 January 1706, Marlborough finally reached [[London]] at the end of his diplomatic tour, but he had already been planning his strategy for the coming season. 
The first option (although it is debatable to what extent the Duke was committed to such an enterprise) was a plan to transfer his forces from the Spanish Netherlands to northern Italy; once there, he intended linking up with Prince Eugene in order to defeat the French and safeguard [[Duchy of Savoy|Savoy]] from being overrun.&lt;ref name=barnett58&gt;Barnett: ''Marlborough,'' p. 158&lt;/ref&gt; Savoy would then serve as a gateway into France by way of the mountain passes, or, alternatively, an invasion with naval support along the Mediterranean coast via [[Nice]] and [[Toulon]] in connection with redoubled efforts of the Allies in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;Trevelyan: ''England Under Queen Anne: Ramillies and the Union with Scotland,'' p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it seems that the Duke’s favoured scheme was to return to the Moselle valley&lt;ref&gt;Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander,'' p. 169&lt;/ref&gt; – where Marshal [[Ferdinand de Marsin|Marsin]] had recently taken command of French forces – and once more attempt an advance into the heart of France. But these decisions soon became academic; shortly after Marlborough landed in the Dutch Republic on 14 April, news arrived of major allied setbacks in the wider war.

[[Image:John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough.png|thumb|left|The Allied commander-in-chief John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough (1650–1722) by [[Sir Godfrey Kneller]].]]

Determined to show the Habsburg and its allies that France was still resolute, Louis XIV prepared to launch a double surprise in [[Alsace]] and northern Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Barnett: ''Marlborough,'' p. 159&lt;/ref&gt; On the latter front, on 19 April, Marshal [[Louis Joseph de Bourbon, duc de Vendôme|Vendôme]] defeated the Imperial army at [[Battle of Calcinato|Calcinato]], pushing the Imperialists back in confusion; French forces were now in a position to prepare for the long-anticipated siege of [[Turin]]. In Alsace, Marshal Villars took the Margrave of Baden by surprise and captured [[Haguenau]], driving him back across the Rhine in some disorder, thus creating a threat on [[Landau]].&lt;ref name=chandler168&gt;Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander,'' p. 168&lt;/ref&gt; With these reverses, the Dutch now refused to contemplate Marlborough’s ambitious march to Italy, or, indeed, any plan that denuded their borders of the Duke and his army.&lt;ref name=falkner33&gt;Falkner: ''Ramillies 1706: Year of Miracles,'' p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, in the interest of coalition harmony, Marlborough prepared to campaign in the Low Countries.&lt;ref name=falkner33/&gt;

===On the move===
The Duke left [[The Hague]] on 9 May. &quot;God knows I go with a heavy heart,&quot; he wrote six days later to his friend and political ally in England, Lord [[Sidney Godolphin, 1st Earl of Godolphin|Godolphin]], &quot;for I have no hope of doing anything considerable, unless the French do what I am very confident they will not … &quot; – in other words, court battle.&lt;ref&gt;Barnett: ''Marlborough,'' p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 May the Duke concentrated his Dutch and English troops at [[Tongeren]], near [[Maastricht]]. The Hanoverians, Hessians and Danes, despite earlier undertakings, found, or invented, pressing reasons for withholding their support.&lt;ref name=chandler168/&gt; Marlborough wrote an appeal to the [[Carl Rudolf, Duke of Württemberg-Neuenstadt|Duke of Württemberg]], the commander of the Danish contingent – &quot;I send you this express to request your Highness to bring forward by a double march your cavalry so as to join us at the earliest moment …&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Falkner: ''Ramillies 1706: Year of Miracles,'' p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the [[Frederick I of Prussia|King in Prussia]] had kept his troops in quarters behind the Rhine while his personal disputes with Vienna and the [[States-General of the Netherlands|States-General]] at The Hague remained unresolved. Nevertheless, the Duke could think of no circumstances why the French would leave their strong positions and attack his army, even if Villeroi was first reinforced by substantial transfers from Marsin’s command.&lt;ref&gt;Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander,'' p. 170&lt;/ref&gt; But in this he had miscalculated. Although Louis XIV wanted peace he wanted it on reasonable terms, and for that he needed victory in the field, and convince the Allies into believing that his resources were by no means exhausted.&lt;ref&gt;Trevelyan: ''England Under Queen Anne: Ramillies and the Union with Scotland,'' p. 103&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the successes in Italy and along the Rhine, Louis XIV was now hopeful of similar results in Flanders. Far from standing on the defensive therefore – and unbeknown to Marlborough – Louis XIV was persistently goading his marshal into action. &quot;[Villeroi] began to imagine,&quot; wrote [[Louis de Rouvroy, duc de Saint-Simon|St Simon]], &quot;that the King doubted his courage, and resolved to stake all at once in an effort to vindicate himself.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Saint-Simon: ''Memoirs, vol i,'' p. 298&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, on 18 May, Villeroi set off from [[Leuven]] at the head of 70 [[battalion]]s, 132 [[Squadron (cavalry)|squadron]]s and 62 [[cannon]] – comprising an overall force of some 60,000 troops – and crossed the river [[Dyle]] to seek battle with the enemy. Spurred on by his growing confidence in his ability to out-general his opponent, and by [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]]’ determination to avenge Blenheim, Villeroi and his generals anticipated success.&lt;ref&gt;Villeroi was convinced that Marlborough had won the Battle of Blenheim by mere chance.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Low Countries 1700.png|thumb|300px|Map of the Low Countries during the War of the Spanish Succession. The village of Ramillies lies near the Mehaigne, a tributary of the Meuse.]]

Neither opponent expected the clash at the exact moment or place where it occurred.&lt;ref name=chandler172&gt;Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander,'' p. 172&lt;/ref&gt; The French moved first to [[Tienen|Tirlemont]], (as if to threaten [[Zoutleeuw]], abandoned by the French in October 1705), before turning southwards, heading for [[Jodoigne]] – this line of march took Villeroi’s army towards the narrow aperture of dry ground between the [[Mehaigne]] and Petite Gheete rivers close to the small villages of Ramillies and Taviers; but neither commander quite appreciated how far his opponent had travelled. Villeroi still believed (on 22 May) the Allies were a full day’s march away when in fact they had camped near Corswaren waiting for the Danish squadrons to catch up; for his part, Marlborough deemed Villeroi still at Jodoigne when in reality he was now approaching the plateau of Mont St. André with the intention of pitching camp near Ramillies (see map at right).&lt;ref name=chandler172/&gt; However, the Prussian infantry was not there. Marlborough wrote to [[Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford (1672–1739)|Lord Raby]], the English resident at Berlin; &quot;If it should please god to give us victory over the enemy, the Allies will be little obliged to the King [Frederick] for the success.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Trevelyan: ''England Under Queen Anne: Ramillies and the Union with Scotland,'' p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;

The following day, at 01:00, Marlborough dispatched [[William Cadogan, 1st Earl Cadogan|Cadogan]], his Quartermaster-General, with an advanced guard to reconnoitre the same dry ground that Villeroi’s army was now heading, country that was well known to the Duke from previous campaigns. Two hours later the Duke followed with the main body: 74 battalions, 123 squadrons, 90 pieces of artillery and 20 mortars, totalling 62,000 troops.&lt;ref name=barnett161&gt;Barnett: ''Marlborough,'' p. 161&lt;/ref&gt; At about 08:00, after Cadogan had just passed Merdorp, his force made brief contact with a party of French [[hussar]]s gathering forage on the edge of the plateau of Jandrenouille. After a brief exchange of shots the French retired and Cardigan's dragoons pressed forward. With a short lift in the mist, Cadogan soon discovered the smartly ordered lines of Villeroi’s advance guard some four miles (6&amp;nbsp;km) off; a galloper hastened back to warn Marlborough. Two hours later the Duke, accompanied by the Dutch field commander [[Henry de Nassau, Lord Overkirk|Veldt Marshal Overkirk]], General Daniel Dopff and the Allied staff, rode up to Cadogan where, on the horizon to the westward he could discern the massed ranks of the French army deploying for battle along the four mile (6.4&amp;nbsp;km) front.&lt;ref name=barnett161/&gt; Marlborough later told Bishop Burnet that, ‘the French army looked the best of any he had ever seen’.&lt;ref&gt;Trevelyan: ''England Under Queen Anne: Ramillies and the Union with Scotland,'' p. 106&lt;/ref&gt;

==Battle==
===Battlefield===
The battlefield of Ramillies is very similar to that of Blenheim, for here too there is an immense area of arable land unimpeded by woods or hedges.&lt;ref name=barnett162&gt;Barnett: ''Marlborough,'' p. 162&lt;/ref&gt; Villeroi’s right rested on the villages of Franquenée and Taviers, with the river Mehaigne protecting his flank. 
A large open plain, just over 1 mile (~2&amp;nbsp;km) wide, lay between Taviers and Ramillies, but unlike Blenheim, there was no stream to hinder the cavalry. His centre was secured by Ramillies itself, lying on a slight eminence which gave distant views to the north and east. The French left flank was protected by broken country, and by a stream, the Petite Gheete, which runs deep between steep and slippery slopes. On the French side of the stream the ground rises to Offus, the village which, together with Autre-Eglise farther north, anchored Villeroi’s left flank. To the west of the Petite Gheete rises the plateau of Mont St. André; a second plain, the plateau of Jandrenouille – upon which the Anglo-Dutch army amassed – rises to the east.&lt;ref name=barnett162/&gt;

===Initial dispositions===
[[Image:Ramillies 1706, initial attack.png|thumb|250px|Initial attack at the Battle of Ramillies, 23 May 1706. To the south, between Taviers and Ramillies, both commanders positioned the bulk of their cavalry. It was here where Marlborough made the breakthrough.]]

At 11:00, the Duke ordered the army to take standard battle formation. On the far right, towards Foulz, the British battalions and squadrons took up their posts in a double line near the Jeuche stream. The centre was formed by the mass of Dutch, German, Protestant Swiss and Scottish infantry – perhaps 30,000 men – facing Offus and Ramillies. Also facing Ramillies Marlborough placed a powerful battery of thirty 24-pounders, dragged into position by a team of oxen; further batteries were positioned overlooking the Petite Gheete. On their left, on the broad plain between Taviers and Ramillies – and where Marlborough thought the decisive encounter must take place&lt;ref&gt;Barnett: ''Marlborough,'' p. 163&lt;/ref&gt; – Overkirk drew the 69 squadrons of the Dutch and Danish horse, supported by 19 battalions of Dutch infantry and two artillery pieces.&lt;ref&gt;Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander,'' p. 173&lt;/ref&gt; 

Meanwhile Villeroi deployed his forces. In Taviers on his right, he placed two battalions of the Greder Suisse Régiment, with a smaller force forward in Franquenée; the whole position was protected by the boggy ground of the Mehaigne river, thus preventing an Allied flanking movement.&lt;ref&gt;Falkner: ''The Wars of Louis XIV, 1667–1714,'' p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; In the open country between Taviers and Ramillies, he placed 82 squadrons under General de Guiscard supported by several interleaved brigades of French, Swiss and Bavarian infantry. Along the Ramillies–Offus–Autre Eglise ridge-line, Villeroi positioned Walloon and Bavarian infantry, supported by the [[Maximilian II Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria|Elector of Bavaria's]] 50 squadrons of Bavarian and Walloon cavalry placed behind on the plateau of Mont St. André. Ramillies, Offus and Autre-Eglise were all packed with troops and put in a state of defence, with alleys barricaded and walls loop-holed for [[muskets]].&lt;ref&gt;Falkner: ''Ramillies 1706: Year of Miracles,'' p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; Villeroi also positioned powerful batteries near Ramillies. These guns (some of which were of the three barrelled kind first seen at [[Battle of Elixheim|Elixheim]] the previous year) enjoyed good arcs of fire, able to fully cover the approaches of the plateau of Jandrenouille over which the Allied infantry would have to pass.

Marlborough, however, noticed several important weaknesses in the French dispositions.&lt;ref&gt;Chandler: ''A Guide to the Battlefields of Europe,'' p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; Tactically, it was imperative for Villeroi to occupy Taviers on his right and Autre-Eglise on his left, but by adopting this posture he had been forced to over-extend his forces.&lt;ref name=lynn304&gt;Lynn: ''The Wars of Louis XIV, 1667–1714,'' p. 304&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, this disposition – concave in relation to the Allied army – gave Marlborough the opportunity to form a more compact line, drawn up in a shorter front between the ‘horns’ of the French crescent; thus when the Allied blow came, it would be more concentrated and carry more weight. Additionally, the Duke’s disposition facilitated the transfer of troops across his front far more easily than his foe, a tactical advantage that would grow in importance as the events of the afternoon unfolded.&lt;ref name=lynn304/&gt; Although Villeroi had the option of enveloping the flanks of the Anglo-Dutch as they deployed on the plateau of Jandrenouille – threatening to encircle their army – the Duke correctly gauged that the characteristically cautious French commander was intent on a defensive battle along the ridge-line.&lt;ref&gt;Falkner: ''The Wars of Louis XIV, 1667–1714,'' p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;

===Taviers===
At 13:00, the batteries went into action; a little later two Anglo-Dutch columns set out from the extremities of their line and attacked the flanks of the Franco-Bavarian army.&lt;ref name=chandlertwo31&gt;Chandler: ''A Guide to the Battlefields of Europe,'' p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; To the south the [[Dutch Blue Guards|Dutch Guards]], under the command of Colonel Wertmüller, came forward with their two field guns to seize the hamlet of Franquenée. The small Swiss garrison in the village, shaken by the sudden onslaught and unsupported by the battalions to their rear, were soon compelled back towards the village of Taviers. Taviers was of particular importance to the Franco-Bavarian position: it protected the otherwise unsupported flank of General de Guiscard’s cavalry on the open plain, whilst at the same time, it allowed the French infantry to pose a threat to the flanks of the Dutch and Danish squadrons as they came forward into position.&lt;ref&gt;Falkner: ''Ramillies 1706: Year of Miracles,'' p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; But hardly had the retreating Swiss rejoined their comrades in that village when the Dutch Guards renewed their attack. The fighting amongst the alleys and cottages soon deteriorated into a fierce bayonet and clubbing ''mêlée'', but the superiority in Dutch firepower soon told. The accomplished French officer, Colonel de la Colonie, standing on the plain nearby remembered – &quot;this village was the opening of the engagement, and the fighting there was almost as murderous as the rest of the battle put together.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;La Colonie: ''The Chronicles of an old Campaigner,'' p. 306&lt;/ref&gt; By about 15:00 the Swiss had been pushed out of the village into the marshes beyond.

[[Image:François de Neufville, duc de Villeroi.png|thumb|170px|left|The Franco-Bavarian commander Duc de Villeroi (1644–1730). The Battle of Ramillies was Villeroi’s last command.]]

Villeroi’s right flank fell into chaos and was now open and vulnerable.&lt;ref&gt;Falkner: ''Ramillies 1706: Year of Miracles,'' p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; Alerted to the situation de Guiscard ordered an immediate attack with 14 squadrons of French dragoons currently stationed in the rear. Two other battalions of the Greder Suisse Régiment were also sent, but the attack was poorly co-ordinated and consequently went in piecemeal. The Anglo-Dutch commanders now sent dismounted Dutch dragoons into Taviers, which, together with the Guards and their field guns, poured concentrated musketry- and canister-fire into the advancing French troops – Colonel d’Aubigni leading his regiment fell mortally wounded.&lt;ref name=colonie309&gt;La Colonie: ''The Chronicles of an old Campaigner,'' p. 309&lt;/ref&gt;

As the French ranks wavered, the leading squadrons of Württemberg’s Danish horse – now unhampered by enemy fire from either village – were also sent into the attack and fell upon the exposed flank of the Franco-Swiss infantry and dragoons.&lt;ref name=chandler175&gt;Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander,'' p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; De la Colonie, with his Grenadiers Rouge regiment, together with the Cologne Guards who were brigaded with them, was now ordered forward from his post south of Ramillies to support the faltering counter-attack on the village. But on his arrival, all was chaos – &quot;Scarcely had my troops got over when the dragoons and Swiss who had preceded us, came tumbling down upon my battalions in full flight … My own fellows turned about and fled along with them.&quot;&lt;ref name=colonie309/&gt; De La Colonie managed to rally some of his grenadiers, together with the remnants of the French dragoons and Greder Suisse battalions, but it was an entirely peripheral operation, offering only fragile support for Villeroi’s right flank.&lt;ref&gt;Falkner: ''Ramillies 1706: Year of Miracles,'' p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;

===Offus and Autre-Eglise===
[[Image:George Hamilton, Earl of Orkney.jpg|thumb|[[George Hamilton, 1st Earl of Orkney]] (1666–1737) by [[Martin Maingaud]]. He personally led the English infantry attacks on Offus and Autre-Eglise.]]

Whilst the attack on Taviers went in, the [[George Hamilton, 1st Earl of Orkney|Earl of Orkney]] launched his first line of English across the Petite Gheete in a determined attack against the barricaded villages of Offus and Autre-Eglise on the Allied right. Villeroi, posting himself near Offus, watched anxiously the redcoats' advance, mindful of the counsel he had received on 6 May from Louis XIV – &quot;Have particular care to that part of the line which will endure the first shock of the English troops.&quot;&lt;ref name=chandlertwo31/&gt; Heeding this advice the French commander began to transfer battalions from his centre to reinforce the left, drawing more foot from the already weakened right to replace them.&lt;ref name=chandler175/&gt;

As the English battalions descended the gentle slope of the Petite Gheete valley, struggling through the boggy stream, they were met by Major General de la Guiche’s disciplined Walloon infantry sent forward from around Offus. After concentrated volleys, exacting heavy casualties on the redcoats, the Walloons reformed back to the ridgeline in good order. The English took some time to reform their ranks on the dry ground beyond the stream and press on up the slope towards the cottages and barricades on the ridge.&lt;ref&gt;Falkner: ''Ramillies 1706: Year of Miracles,'' p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; The vigour of the English assault, however, was such that they threatened to break through the line of the villages and out onto the open plateau of Mont St André beyond. This was potentially dangerous for the Allied infantry who would then be at the mercy of the Elector’s Bavarian and Walloon squadrons patiently waiting on the plateau for the order to move.&lt;ref&gt;Falkner: ''Ramillies 1706: Year of Miracles,'' p. 71&lt;/ref&gt;

Although [[Henry Lumley]]’s British cavalry had managed to cross the marshy ground around the Petite Gheete, it was soon evident to Marlborough that sufficient cavalry support would not be practicable and that the battle could not be won on the Allied right.&lt;ref name=chandler176&gt;Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander,'' p. 176&lt;/ref&gt; The Duke, therefore, called off the attack against Offus and Autre-Eglise. To make sure that Orkney obeyed his order to withdraw, Marlborough sent his Quartermaster-General in person with the command. Despite Orkney’s protestations, Cadogan insisted on compliance and, reluctantly, Orkney gave the word for his troops to fall back to their original positions on the edge of the plateau of Jandrenouille.  It is still not clear how far Orkney’s advance was planned only as a feint; according to historian David Chandler it is probably more accurate to surmise that Marlborough launched Orkney in a serious probe with a view to sounding out the possibilities of the sector.&lt;ref name=chandler175/&gt; Nevertheless, the attack had served its purpose. Villeroi had given his personal attention to that wing and strengthened it with large bodies of horse and foot that ought to have been taking part in the decisive struggle south of Ramillies.&lt;ref&gt;Trevelyan: ''England Under Queen Anne: Ramillies and the Union with Scotland,'' p. 109&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ramillies===
Meanwhile, the Anglo-Dutch assault on Ramillies was gaining pace. Marlborough’s younger brother, General of Infantry, [[Charles Churchill (British army officer)|Charles Churchill]], ordered four brigades of foot to attack the village. The assault consisted of 12 battalions of Dutch infantry commanded by Major Generals Schultz and Spaar; two brigades of Saxons under [[Johann Matthias von der Schulenburg|Count Schulenburg]]; a Scottish brigade in Dutch service led by the [[John Campbell, 2nd Duke of Argyll|2nd Duke of Argyle]]; and a small brigade of Protestant Swiss.&lt;ref&gt;Falkner: ''Ramillies 1706: Year of Miracles,'' p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; The 20 French and Bavarian battalions in Ramillies, supported by Irish dragoons and a small brigade of Cologne and Bavarian Guards under the [[Alessandro, Marquis de Maffei|Marquis de Maffei]], put up a determined defence, initially driving back the attackers with severe losses.&lt;ref&gt;Falkner: ''Ramillies 1706: Year of Miracles,'' p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; 

Seeing that Schultz and Spaar were faltering, Marlborough now ordered Orkney’s second-line British and Danish battalions (who had not been used in the assault on Offus and Autre-Eglise) to move south towards Ramillies. Shielded as they were from observation by a slight fold in the land, their commander, Brigadier-General van Pallandt, ordered the regimental colours to be left in place on the edge of the plateau to convince their opponents they were still in their initial position. Therefore, unbeknown to the French who remained oblivious to the Allies’ real strength and intentions on the opposite side of the Petite Gheete, Marlborough was throwing his full weight against Ramillies and the open plain to the south. Villeroi meanwhile, was still moving more reserves of infantry in the opposite direction towards his left flank; crucially, it would be some time before the French commander noticed the subtle change in emphasis of the enemy dispositions.&lt;ref&gt;Falkner: ''Ramillies 1706: Year of Miracles,'' p. 78&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Decapitation of Colonel Bringfield.png|thumb|left|Ten of Diamonds: The decapitation of Colonel Bringfield. A monument to Bringfield in the north aisle of [[Westminster Abbey]] recalls the tale.&lt;ref&gt;Trevelyan: ''England Under Queen Anne: Ramillies and the Union with Scotland,'' p. 113&lt;/ref&gt;]]

At around 15:30, Overkirk advanced his massed squadrons on the open plain in support of the infantry attack on Ramillies. Overkirk's squadrons – 48 Dutch, supported on their left by 21 Danish – steadily advanced towards the enemy (taking care not to prematurely tire the horses), before breaking into a trot to gain the impetus for their charge.&lt;ref&gt;La Colonie: ''The Chronicles of an old Campaigner,'' p. 313&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Antoine de Pas de Feuquières|Marquis de Feuquières]] writing after the battle described the scene – &quot;They advanced in four lines … As they approached they advanced their second and fourth lines into the intervals of their first and third lines; so that when they made their advance upon us, they formed only one front, without any intermediate spaces.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Falkner: ''Ramillies 1706: Year of Miracles,'' p. 80&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial clash favoured the Dutch and Danish squadrons. The disparity of numbers – exacerbated by Villeroi stripping their ranks of infantry to reinforce his left flank – enabled Overkirk's cavalry to throw the first line of French horse back in some disorder towards their second-line squadrons. This line also came under severe pressure and, in turn, was forced back to their third-line of cavalry and the few battalions still remaining on the plain.&lt;ref&gt;Falkner: ''Ramillies 1706: Year of Miracles,'' p. 81&lt;/ref&gt; But these French horsemen were amongst the best in Louis XIV’s army – the ''[[Maison du Roi]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Maison du Roi (Household Cavalry): The mounted elements of the French ''Maison du Roi'' at Ramillies consisted of the ''Gardes du Corps'', the ''Royal Carabiniers'', the ''Mousquetaires'', the ''Compagnie des Grenadiers à Cheval'' and the ''Compagnie des Gens d’Armes''.&lt;/ref&gt; supported by four elite squadrons of Bavarian Cuirassiers. Ably led by de Guiscard, the French cavalry rallied, thrusting back the Allied squadrons in successful local counterattacks.&lt;ref&gt;Falkner: ''Ramillies 1706: Year of Miracles,'' p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; On Overkirk’s right flank, close to Ramillies, ten of his squadrons suddenly broke ranks and were scattered, riding headlong to the rear to recover their order, leaving the left flank of the Allied assault on Ramillies dangerously exposed. Notwithstanding the lack of infantry support, de Guiscard threw his cavalry forward in an attempt to split the Allied army in two. 

A crisis threatened the centre, but from his vantage point Marlborough was at once aware of the situation.&lt;ref name=chandler176/&gt; The Allied commander now summoned the cavalry on the right wing to reinforce his centre, leaving only the English squadrons in support of Orkney. Thanks to a combination of battle-smoke and favourable terrain, his redeployment went unnoticed by Villeroi who made no attempt to transfer any of his own 50 unused squadrons.&lt;ref name=chandler176/&gt; While he waited for the fresh reinforcements to arrive, Marlborough flung himself into the ''mêlée'', rallying some of the Dutch cavalry who were recoiling in confusion. But his personal involvement nearly led to his undoing. A number of French horsemen, recognising the Duke, came surging towards his party. Marlborough’s horse tumbled and the Duke was thrown –  &quot;Milord Marlborough was rid over,&quot; wrote Orkney some time later.&lt;ref&gt;Falkner: ''Ramillies 1706: Year of Miracles,'' p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; It was a critical moment of the battle. &quot;Major-General Murray,&quot; recalled one eye witness, &quot; … seeing him fall, marched up in all haste with two Swiss battalions to save him and stop the enemy who were hewing all down in their way.&quot;&lt;ref name=barnett168&gt;Barnett: ''Marlborough,'' p. 168&lt;/ref&gt; Fortunately Marlborough’s newly appointed aide-de-camp, [[Richard Molesworth, 3rd Viscount Molesworth|Richard Molesworth]], galloped to the rescue, mounted the Duke on his horse and made good their escape, before Murray’s disciplined ranks threw back the pursuing French troopers.&lt;ref name=barnett168/&gt; 

After a brief pause, Marlborough’s equerry, Colonel Bringfield (or Bingfield), led up another of the Duke’s spare horses; but whilst assisting him onto his mount, the unfortunate Bringfield was hit by an errant cannonball that sheared off his head. One account has it that the cannonball flew between the Captain-General’s legs before hitting the unfortunate colonel, whose torso fell at Marlborough’s feet – a moment subsequently depicted in a lurid set of contemporary playing cards.&lt;ref name=barnett168/&gt; Nevertheless the danger passed, enabling the Duke to attend to the positioning of the cavalry reinforcements feeding down from his right flank – a change of which Villeroi remained blissfully unaware.&lt;ref&gt;Falkner: ''Ramillies 1706: Year of Miracles,'' p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;

===Breakthrough===
[[Image:Ramillies 1706, breakthrough and pursuit.PNG|thumb|250px|Allied squadrons transferred from north to south gave the Allies a 5–3 advantage on the plain where some 25,000 French and Allied cavalry were heavily engaged.&lt;ref&gt;Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander,'' p. 177&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The time was about 16:30, and the two armies were in close contact across the whole four-mile (6&amp;nbsp;km) front, from the skirmishing in the marshes in the south, through the vast cavalry battle on the open plain; to the fierce struggle for Ramillies at the centre, and to the north, where, around the cottages of Offus and Autre-Eglise, Orkney and de la Guiche faced each other across the Petite Gheete ready to renew hostilities.

The arrival of the transferring squadrons now began to tip the balance in favour of the Allies. Tired, and suffering a growing list of casualties, the numerical inferiority of Guiscard’s squadrons battling on the plain at last began to tell.&lt;ref&gt;Falkner: ''Ramillies 1706: Year of Miracles,'' p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; After earlier failing to hold or retake Franquenée and Taviers, Guiscard’s right flank had become dangerously exposed and a fatal gap had opened on the right of their line. Taking advantage of this breach, Württemberg’s Danish cavalry now swept forward, wheeling to penetrate the flank of the Maison du Roi whose attention was almost entirely fixed on holding back the Dutch. Sweeping forwards, virtually without resistance, the 21 Danish squadrons reformed behind the French around the area of the Tomb of Ottomond, facing north across the plateau of Mont St André towards the exposed flank of Villeroi’s army.&lt;ref&gt;Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander,'' p. 177. Trevelyan calls this the decisive manoeuvre of the day.&lt;/ref&gt;

The final Allied reinforcements for the cavalry contest to the south were at last in position; Marlborough’s superiority on the left could no longer be denied, and his fast-moving plan took hold of the battlefield. Now, far too late, Villeroi tried to redeploy his 50 unused squadrons, but a desperate attempt to form line facing south, stretching from Offus to Mont St, André, floundered amongst the baggage and tents of the French camp carelessly left there after the initial deployment.&lt;ref&gt;Trevelyan: ''England Under Queen Anne: Ramillies and the Union with Scotland,'' p. 116. After the retreat had become general, further disaster and confusion resulted from the block of waggons breaking down in the mud. The artillery could not pass, resulting in the loss of most of Villeroi’s cannon.&lt;/ref&gt; The Allied commander ordered his cavalry forward against the now heavily outnumbered French and Bavarian horsemen. De Guiscard’s right flank, without proper infantry support, could no longer resist the onslaught and, turning their horses northwards, they broke and fled in complete disorder.&lt;ref&gt;Falkner: ''Ramillies 1706: Year of Miracles,'' p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; Even the squadrons currently being scrambled together by Villeroi behind Ramillies could not withstand the onslaught. &quot;We had not got forty yards on our retreat,&quot; remembered [http://books.google.com/books?id=kzCsAAAAIAAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Amiable%20Renegade&amp;pg=PA77#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Captain Peter Drake], the Irish mercenary serving with the French – &quot;when the words ''sauve qui peut'' went through the great part, if not the whole army, and put all to confusion&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Trevelyan: ''England Under Queen Anne: Ramillies and the Union with Scotland,'' p. 115&lt;/ref&gt;

In Ramillies, the Allied infantry, now reinforced by the English troops brought down from the north, at last broke through. The Régiment de Picardie stood their ground but were caught between Colonel Borthwick’s Scots-Dutch regiment and the English reinforcements. Borthwick was killed, as was Charles O’Brien, the Irish Viscount Clare in French service, fighting at the head of his regiment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.triskelle.eu/lyrics/claresdragoons.php?index=080.010.020.030&amp;rec=142 Falkner: ''Ramillies 1706: Year of Miracles,''  p. 94]&lt;/ref&gt; The Marquis de Maffei attempted one last stand with his Bavarian and Cologne Guards, but it proved in vain. Noticing a rush of horsemen fast approaching from the south, he later recalled – &quot; … I went towards the nearest of these squadrons to instruct their officer, but instead of being listened to [I] was immediately surrounded and called upon to ask for quarter.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Falkner: ''Ramillies 1706: Year of Miracles,'' p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pursuit===
The roads leading north and west were choked with fugitives. Orkney now sent his English troops back across the Petite Gheete stream to once again storm Offus where de la Guiche’s infantry had begun to drift away in the confusion.&lt;ref name=falkner98&gt;Falkner: ''Ramillies 1706: Year of Miracles,'' p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; To the right of the infantry Lord John Hay’s [[Royal Scots Greys|‘Scots Greys’]] also picked their way across the stream and charged the Régment du Roi within Autre-Eglise. &quot;Our dragoons,&quot; wrote John Deane, &quot;pushing into the village … made terrible slaughter of the enemy.&quot;&lt;ref name=falkner98/&gt; The Bavarian Horse Grenadiers and the Electoral Guards withdrew and formed a shield about Villeroi and the Elector but were scattered by Lumley’s cavalry. Stuck in the mass of fugitives fleeing the battlefield, the French and Bavarian commanders narrowly escaped capture by General Cornelius Wood, who, unaware of their identity, had to content himself with the seizure of two Bavarian Lieutenant-Generals.&lt;ref&gt;Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander,'' p. 178&lt;/ref&gt; Far to the south, the remnants of de la Colonie’s brigade headed in the opposite direction towards the French held fortress of [[Namur (city)|Namur]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;La Colonie: ''The Chronicles of an old Campaigner,'' p. 316&lt;/ref&gt;

The retreat became a rout.&lt;ref name=lynn306&gt;Lynn: ''The Wars of Louis XIV, 1667–1714,'' p.  306&lt;/ref&gt; Individual Allied commanders drove their troops forward in pursuit, allowing their beaten enemy no chance to recover. Soon the Allied infantry could no longer keep up, but their cavalry were off the leash, heading through the gathering night for the crossings on the Dyle river.&lt;ref name=falkner102&gt;Falkner: ''Ramillies 1706: Year of Miracles,'' p. 102&lt;/ref&gt; At last, however, Marlborough called a halt to the pursuit shortly after midnight near Meldert, {{convert|12|mi|km}} from the field.&lt;ref name=falkner102/&gt; &quot;It was indeed a truly shocking sight to see the miserable remains of this mighty army,&quot; [http://books.google.com/books?id=kzCsAAAAIAAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Amiable%20Renegade&amp;pg=PA77#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false wrote Captain Drake], &quot;… reduced to a handful.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Trevelyan: ''England Under Queen Anne: Ramillies and the Union with Scotland,'' p. 118&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Amiable Renegade: The Memoirs of Captain Peter Drake 1671-1753&quot; pp. 77-79&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
[[File:Ramillies 1706 Duprez.PNG|thumb|250px|The Duke of Marlborough receives captured standards at Ramillies. Artist: H. Dupray.]]

What was left of Villeroi’s army was now broken in spirit; the imbalance of the casualty figures amply demonstrates the extent of the disaster for Louis XIV’s army ([[#Casualties|See below]]). In addition, hundreds of French soldiers were fugitives, many of whom would never remuster to the [[Colours, standards and guidons|colours]]. Villeroi also lost 52 artillery pieces and his entire engineer [[Pontoon bridge|pontoon]] train.&lt;ref name =falkner105&gt;Falkner: ''Ramillies 1706: Year of Miracles,'' p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; In the words of Marshal Villars, the French defeat at Ramillies was – &quot;The most shameful, humiliating and disastrous of routs.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Barnett: ''Marlborough,'' p. 170&lt;/ref&gt; 

Town after town now succumbed to the Allies. [[Leuven]] fell on 25 May 1706; three days later, the Allies entered [[Brussels]], the capital of the Spanish Netherlands. Marlborough realised the great opportunity created by the early victory of Ramillies, – &quot;We now have the whole summer before us,&quot; wrote the Duke from Brussels to [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer|Robert Harley]], &quot;and with the blessing of God I shall make the best use of it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander,'' p. 179&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mechelen|Malines]], [[Lier, Belgium|Lierre]], [[Ghent]], [[Aalst, Belgium|Alost]], [[Damme]], [[Oudenaarde]], [[Bruges]], and on 6 June [[Antwerp]], all subsequently fell to Marlborough’s victorious army and, like Brussels, proclaimed the Austrian candidate for the Spanish throne, the [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Archduke Charles]], as their sovereign.&lt;ref&gt;Trevelyan: ''England Under Queen Anne: Ramillies and the Union with Scotland,'' p. 121&lt;/ref&gt; Villeroi was helpless to arrest the process of collapse. When Louis learnt of the disaster, he recalled Marshal Vendôme from northern Italy to take command in Flanders; but it would be weeks before the command changed hands.

[[Image:Ramillies campaign 1706 - Allied gains.png|thumb|250px|left|Allied gains of the Ramillies campaign 1706. (Note: Dates of capitulation differ slightly depending on source).]]

As news spread of the Allies’ triumph, the Prussians, Hessians and Hanoverian contingents, long delayed by their respective rulers, eagerly joined the pursuit of the broken French and Bavarian forces. &quot;This,&quot; wrote Marlborough wearily, &quot;I take to be owing to our late success.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Falkner: ''Ramillies 1706: Year of Miracles,'' p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Overkirk took the port of [[Ostend]] on 4 July thus opening a direct route to the [[English Channel]] for communication and supply, but the Allies were making scant progress against [[Dendermonde]] whose governor, the [[Marquis de Valée]], was stubbornly resisting. Only later when Cadogan and Churchill went to take charge did the town’s defences begin to fail.&lt;ref&gt;Falkner: ''Ramillies 1706: Year of Miracles,'' p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; 

Vendôme formally took over command in Flanders on 4 August;&lt;ref&gt;Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander,'' p. 181. Lynn states 1 August&lt;/ref&gt; Villeroi, his defeated predecessor, would never again receive a major command, bemoaning – &quot;I cannot foresee a happy day in my life save only that of my death.&quot;&lt;ref name=lynn308&gt;Lynn: ''The Wars of Louis XIV, 1667–1714,''  p. 308&lt;/ref&gt; Louis XIV however, was more forgiving, greeting his old friend with the kind words – &quot;At our age, Marshal, we must no longer expect good fortune.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Falkner: ''Ramillies 1706: Year of Miracles,'' p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; In the mean time, Marlborough invested the elaborate fortress of [[Menen|Menin]] which, after a costly siege, capitulated on 22 August. Dendermonde finally succumbed on 6 September followed by [[Ath]] – the last conquest of 1706 – on 2 October.&lt;ref&gt;Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander,'' p. 182&lt;/ref&gt; By the time Marlborough had closed down the Ramillies campaign he had denied the French most of the Spanish Netherlands west of the [[Meuse River|Meuse]] and north of the [[Sambre]] – it was an unsurpassed operational triumph for the English Duke.&lt;ref name=lynn308/&gt; 

The immediate question for the Allies now was how to deal with the Spanish Netherlands, a subject about which the Austrians and the Dutch were diametrically opposed.&lt;ref&gt;Trevelyan: ''England Under Queen Anne: Ramillies and the Union with Scotland,'' p. 132&lt;/ref&gt; Emperor Joseph I, acting on behalf of his younger brother King ’Charles III’, absent in Spain, claimed that reconquered Brabant and Flanders should be put under immediate possession of a governor named by himself. The Dutch, however, who had supplied the major share of the troops and money to secure the victory (the Austrians had produced nothing of either) claimed the government of the region till the war was over, and that after the peace they should continue to garrison Barrier Fortresses stronger than those which had fallen so easily to Louis XIV’s forces in 1701. Marlborough mediated between the two parties but favoured the Dutch position. To sway the Duke’s opinion, the Emperor offered Marlborough the governorship of the Spanish Netherlands. It was a tempting offer, but in the name of Allied unity, it was one he refused.&lt;ref&gt;Trevelyan: ''England Under Queen Anne: Ramillies and the Union with Scotland,'' p. 135. Marlborough never fully abandoned the hope that one day he might be proclaimed governor of the Spanish Netherlands. It was his own personal ambition that created mutual suspicion between the Duke and the Dutch.&lt;/ref&gt; In the end England and the Dutch Republic took control of the newly won territory for the duration of the war; after which it was to be handed over to the direct rule of ‘Charles III’, subject to the reservation of a Dutch Barrier, the extent and nature of which had yet to be settled.&lt;ref&gt;The Dutch expected the Belgians to contribute to the cost of the war and the maintenance of the garrisons. Subsequently, the hardships felt by the Belgians led to serious military setbacks when in 1708, Bruges and Ghent swapped sides.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, on the Upper Rhine, Villars had been forced onto the defensive as battalion after battalion had been sent north to bolster collapsing French forces in Flanders; there was now no possibility of his undertaking the re-capture of Landau.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn:  ''The Wars of Louis XIV, 1667–1714,'' p. 309&lt;/ref&gt; Further good news for the Allies arrived from northern Italy where, on 7 September, Prince Eugene had routed a French army before the [[Piedmont]]ese capital, [[Battle of Turin|Turin]], driving the Franco-Spanish forces from northern Italy. Only from Spain did Louis XIV receive any good news where [[António Luís de Sousa, 2nd Marquess of Minas]] had been forced to retreat from [[Madrid]] towards [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]], allowing [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]] to re-enter his capital on 4 October. All in all though, the situation had changed considerably and Louis XIV began to look for ways to end what was fast becoming a ruinous war for France. For [[Queen Anne of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] also, the Ramillies campaign had one overriding significance – &quot;Now we have God be thanked so hopeful a prospect of peace.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Gregg: ''Queen Anne,'' p. 216&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of continuing the momentum of victory, however, cracks in Allied unity would enable Louis XIV to reverse some of the major setbacks suffered at Turin and Ramillies.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn: ''The Wars of Louis XIV, 1667–1714,'' p. 312&lt;/ref&gt;

==Casualties==
The total number of French casualties cannot be calculated precisely, so complete was the collapse of the Franco-Bavarian army that day.&lt;ref name=falkner105/&gt; [[David G. Chandler]]’s ''Marlborough as Military Commander'' and ''A Guide to the Battlefields of Europe'' are consistent with regards to French casualty figures i.e., 12,000 dead and wounded plus some 7,000 taken prisoner. James Falkner, in ''Ramillies 1706: Year of Miracles,'' also notes 12,000 dead and wounded and states ‘up to 10,000’ taken prisoner. In ''The Collins Encyclopaedia of Military History'', Dupuy puts Villeroi’s dead and wounded at 8,000, with a further 7,000 captured. John Millner’s memoirs – ''Compendious Journal'' (1733) – is more specific, recording 12,087 of Villeroi’s army were killed or wounded, with another 9,729 taken prisoner. In ''Marlborough'', however, [[Correlli Barnett]] puts the total casualty figure as high as 30,000 – 15,000 dead and wounded with an additional 15,000 taken captive. Trevelyan estimates Villeroi’s casualties at 13,000, but adds, ‘his losses by desertion may have doubled that number’. La Colonie omits a casualty figure in his ''Chronicles of an old Campaigner''; but Saint-Simon in his ''Memoirs'' states 4,000 killed, adding 'many others were wounded and many important persons were taken prisoner'. [[Voltaire]], however, in ''Histoire du siecle du Louis XIV'' records, 'the French lost there twenty thousand men'.

Brian Kernighan is currently a Professor at the Computer Science Department of [[Princeton University]], where he is also the Undergraduate Department Representative.  

Kernighan's name became widely known through co-authorship of the [[The C Programming Language (book)|first book]] on the [[C (programming language)|C programming language]] with [[Dennis Ritchie]]. Kernighan has said that he had no part in the design of the C language (&quot;it's entirely Dennis Ritchie's work&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Interview with Brian Kernighan | url = http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/7035 | date = 29 July 2003 | publisher = [[Linux Journal]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He authored many [[Unix]] programs, including [[ditroff]], and [[cron]] for [[Version 7 Unix]].

In collaboration with [[Shen Lin]] he devised well-known [[heuristics]] for two [[NP-complete]] optimization problems: [[graph partitioning]] and the [[travelling salesman problem]]. (In a display of authorial equity, the former is usually called the ''[[Kernighan–Lin]]'' algorithm, while the latter is styled ''[[Lin–Kernighan]]''.)

Kernighan was the software editor for [[Prentice Hall|Prentice Hall International]]. His &quot;Software Tools&quot; series spread the essence of 'C/Unix thinking' with makeovers for [[BASIC]], [[FORTRAN]], and [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]] - and most notably his '[[Ratfor]]' (rational FORTRAN) was put in the public domain.

He has said that if stranded on an island with only one programming language it would have to be [[C (programming language)|C]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/~mihaib/kernighan-interview/index.html An Interview with Brian Kernighan&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Kernighan coined the term [[Unix]] in the 1970s. The original term he coined was Unics (for Uniplexed Information and Computing Service, a play on [[Multics]]), which was later changed to Unix. Kernighan is also known as a coiner of the expression &quot;'''What You See Is All You Get (WYSIAYG)'''&quot;, which is sarcastic variant of the original &quot;What You See Is What You Get&quot; ([[WYSIWYG]]).
Kernighan's term is used to indicate that WYSIWYG systems might throw away information in a document that could be useful in other contexts.

==Education==
He received his [[Bachelor's degree]] in [[Engineering Physics]] from the [[University of Toronto]]. He received his PhD in [[electrical engineering]] from [[Princeton University]], where he has held a professorship in the department of computer science since 2000.  Each fall he teaches a course called &quot;Computers in Our World&quot;, which introduces the fundamentals of computing to non-majors.

'''BCPL''' ('''Basic Combined Programming Language''') is a [[procedural programming|procedural]], [[imperative programming|imperative]], and [[structured programming|structured]] [[computer]] [[programming language]] designed by [[Martin Richards (computer scientist)|Martin Richards]] of the [[University of Cambridge]] in 1966.

== Design ==
Originally intended for writing [[compiler]]s for other languages, BCPL is no longer in common use. However, its influence is still felt because a stripped down and syntactically changed version of BCPL, called [[B (programming language)|B]], was the language on which the [[C (programming language)|C programming language]] was based. BCPL was the first [[curly bracket programming language]], and the curly brackets survived the syntactical changes and have become a common means of denoting program source code statements. In practice, on limited keyboards of the day, source programs often used the sequences $( and $) in place of the symbols { and }.
The single-line '//' comments of BCPL, which were not taken up in [[C (programming language)|C]], reappeared in [[C++]], and later in [[C99]].

BCPL was a response to difficulties with its predecessor [[Combined Programming Language]] (CPL), created during the early 1960s. Richards created BCPL by &quot;removing those features of the full language which make compilation difficult&quot;. The first compiler implementation, for the [[IBM 7094]] under [[Compatible Time-Sharing System]] (CTSS), was written while Richards was visiting [[Project MAC]] at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) in the spring of 1967. The language was first described in a paper presented to the 1969 Spring Joint Computer Conference. 

The language is clean, consistent, powerful, and portable. It thus proved possible to write small and simple compilers for it; reputedly some compilers could be run in 16 [[kilobyte]]s. Further, the Richards compiler, itself written in BCPL, was easily portable. BCPL was thus a popular choice for [[bootstrapping (compilers)|bootstrapping]] a system.

A major reason for the compiler's portability lay in its structure. It was split into two parts: the front end parsed the source and generated [[O-code machine|O-code]] for a [[virtual machine]], and the back end took the O-code and translated it into the code for the target machine. Only 1/5 of the compiler's code needed to be rewritten to support a new machine, a task that usually took between 2 and 5 [[man-month]]s. This approach became common practice later, e.g., [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]] or [[Java (programming language)|Java]], but the Richards BCPL compiler was the first to define a virtual machine for this purpose.

The language is unusual in having only one [[data type]]: a [[Word (data type)|word]], a fixed number of bits, usually chosen to align with the architecture's machine word and of adequate capacity to represent any valid storage address. For many machines of the time, this data type was a 16-bit word. This choice later proved to be a significant problem when BCPL was used on machines in which the smallest addressable item was not a word, but a [[byte]] or on machines with larger word sizes: 32-bit and 64-bit words, which allowed them to manage large address spaces.

The interpretation of any value was determined by the operators used to process the values. (For example, + added two values together treating them as [[integer]]s; ! indirected through a value, effectively treating it as a pointer.) In order for this to work, the implementation provided no [[type checking]]. The [[Hungarian notation]] was developed to help programmers avoid inadvertent type errors.

The mismatch between BCPL's [[Word (data type)|word orientation]] and [[byte orientation|byte-oriented]] hardware was addressed in several ways. One was providing standard library routines for packing and unpacking words into byte strings. Later, two language features were added: the bit-field selection operator and the infix byte indirection operator (denoted by the '%' character).

BCPL handles bindings spanning separate [[compilation unit]]s in a unique way. There are no user-declarable global variables; instead there is a global vector, which is similar to &quot;blank common&quot; in [[Fortran]].  All data shared between different compilation units comprises scalars and pointers to vectors stored in a pre-arranged place in the global vector.  Thus the header files (files included during compilation using the &quot;GET&quot; directive) become the primary means of synchronizing global data between compilation units, containing &quot;GLOBAL&quot; directives that present lists of symbolic names, each paired with a number that associates the name with the corresponding numerically addressed word in the global vector.  As well as variables, the global vector also contains bindings for external procedures.  This makes dynamic loading of compilation units very simple to achieve.  Instead of relying on the link loader of the underlying implementation, effectively BCPL gives the programmer control of the linking process.

The global vector also made it very simple to replace or augment standard library routines. A program could save the pointer from the global vector to the original routine and replace it with a pointer to an alternative version. The alternative might call the original as part of its processing. This could be used as a quick ad-hoc debugging aid.

BCPL is reputedly the language in which the original [[hello world program]] was written.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} The first [[MUD]] was also written in BCPL.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mudconnect.com/mud_intro.html The Mud Connector: Mud and RPG game index, mudlist and reviews: Introduction to MUDs]&lt;/ref&gt;

Several [[operating system]]s were written partially or wholly in BCPL (for example, [[TRIPOS]] and significant parts of [[AmigaOS]], including Kickstart and the earliest versions of [[AmigaDOS]]). BCPL was also the initial language used in the seminal [[Xerox PARC]] [[Alto (computer)|Alto]] project, the first modern [[personal computer]]; among other projects, the [[Bravo (software)|Bravo]] [[document preparation system]] was written in BCPL.

By 1970, implementations existed for the [[Honeywell 635]] and [[Honeywell 645|645]], the [[IBM 360]], the [[TX-2]], the [[CDC 6400]], the [[Univac 1108]], the [[Programmed Data Processor|PDP-9]], the [[KDF 9]] and the [[Atlas 2]]. There was also a version produced for the [[BBC Micro]] in the mid 1980s by Richards Computer Products, a company started by John Richards, the brother of Dr. Martin Richards.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}  The [[BBC Domesday Project]] made use of the language. Versions of BCPL for the [[Amstrad CPC]] and [[Amstrad PCW]] computers were also released in 1986 by UK software house Arnor Ltd.

In 1979 implementations of BCPL existed for at least 25 architectures; in 2001 it sees little use.

The philosophy of BCPL can be summarised by quoting from the book ''BCPL, the language and its compiler'':  
{{quote|The philosophy of BCPL is not one of the tyrant who thinks he knows best and lays down the law on what is and what is not allowed; rather, BCPL acts more as a servant offering his services to the best of his ability without complaint, even when confronted with apparent nonsense.  The programmer is always assumed to know what he is doing and is not hemmed in by petty restrictions.}}

The design, and philosophy, of BCPL strongly influenced [[B (programming language)|B]], which in turn influenced [[C (programming language)|C]].

There are rumours that BCPL actually stood for &quot;Bootstrap Cambridge Programming Language&quot;, however CPL was never created since development stopped at BCPL, and the acronym was reinterpreted for the BCPL book.

[[Image:BB61 USS Iowa BB61 broadside USN.jpg|thumb|The firepower of a battleship demonstrated by {{USS|Iowa|BB-61|6}} (ca. 1984)]]

A '''battleship''' was a large [[armour|armored]] [[warship]] with a main [[artillery battery|battery]] consisting of heavy [[caliber]] [[gun]]s. Battleships were larger, better armed and armored than [[cruiser]]s and [[destroyer]]s. As the largest armed ships in a fleet, battleships were used to attain [[command of the sea]] and represented the apex of a nation's naval power from about 1875 up until [[World War II]]. With the rise of air power and guided missiles, large guns were no longer deemed necessary to establish naval superiority. 

Battleship design evolved to incorporate and adapt technological advances to maintain an edge. The word ''battleship'' was coined around 1794 and is a contraction of the phrase ''[[ship of the line|line-of-'''battle ship''']],'' the dominant wooden warship during the [[Age of Sail]].&lt;ref name=&quot;OED&quot;&gt;&quot;battleship&quot; The Oxford English Dictionary. 2nd ed. 1989. OED Online. Oxford University Press. 4 April 2000&lt;/ref&gt; The term came into formal use in the late 1880s to describe a type of [[ironclad warship]],&lt;ref name = &quot;Stoll&quot;&gt;Stoll, J. ''Steaming in the Dark?'', Journal of Conflict Resolution Vol. 36 No. 2, June 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; now referred to as [[pre-dreadnought battleship]]s. In 1906, the commissioning of {{HMS|Dreadnought|1906|6}} heralded a revolution in battleship design. Following battleship designs that were influenced by HMS ''Dreadnought'' were referred to as &quot;[[dreadnought]]s&quot;.

Battleships were a symbol of [[navy|naval]] dominance and national might, and for decades the battleship was a major factor in both [[diplomacy]] and [[military strategy]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Sondhaus&quot;&gt;Sondhaus, L. ''Naval Warfare 1815–1914'', ISBN 0-415-21478-5.&lt;/ref&gt; The global [[arms race]] in battleship construction beginning in the late 19th century and exacerbated by ''Dreadnought'' was one of the causes of [[World War I]], which saw a clash of large battle fleets at the [[Battle of Jutland]]. The [[Treaty for the Limitation of Naval Armament|Naval Treaties]] of the 1920s and 1930s limited the number of battleships but did not end the evolution of design. Both the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] and the [[Axis Powers]] deployed battleships of old construction and new during World War II.

The value of the battleship has been questioned, even during the period of their prominence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=O'Connell, Robert J. |title=Sacred vessels: the cult of the battleship and the rise of the U. S. Navy |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford [Oxfordshire] |year=1993 |pages= |isbn=0-19-508006-8 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of the immense resources spent on battleships, there were few pitched battleship clashes. Even with their enormous firepower and protection, battleships were increasingly vulnerable to much smaller, cheaper ordnance and craft: initially the [[torpedo]] and the [[naval mine]], and later aircraft and the [[guided missile]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Lenton&quot;&gt;Lenton, H. T.: ''Krigsfartyg efter 1860''&lt;/ref&gt; The growing range of naval engagements led to the [[aircraft carrier]] replacing the battleship as the leading [[capital ship]] during World War II, with the last battleship to be launched being {{HMS|Vanguard|23|6}} in 1944. Battleships were retained by the [[United States Navy]] into the [[Cold War]] only for [[fire support]] purposes. The last battleships were removed from the U.S. [[Naval Vessel Register]] in March 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nvr.navy.mil/nvrships/details/BB64.htm &quot;Battleship&quot;] in ''Naval Vessel Register''. United States Navy. Retrieved 24 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ships of the line==
{{Main|Ship of the line}}
A ship of the line was a large, unarmored [[wood]]en sailing ship on which was mounted a [[artillery battery|battery]] of up to 120 [[smoothbore]] [[gun]]s and [[carronade]]s. The ship of the line was a gradual evolution of a basic design that dates back to the 15th century, and, apart from growing in size, it changed little between the adoption of [[line of battle]] tactics in the early 17th century and the end of the sailing battleship's heyday in the 1830s. From 1794, the alternative term 'line of battle ship' was contracted (informally at first) to 'battle ship' or 'battleship'.&lt;ref name = &quot;OED&quot; /&gt;

[[Image:TheNapoleonAtToulonIn1852ByLauvergne.jpg|thumb|''[[French ship Napoléon (1850)|Le Napoléon]]'' (1850), the first steam battleship]]
The sheer number of guns fired [[broadside]] meant that a sailing battleship could wreck any wooden vessel, smashing its [[hull (watercraft)|hull]] and [[mast (sailing)|masts]] and killing its crew. However, the effective range of the guns was as little as a few hundred yards, so the battle tactics of sailing ships depended in part on the wind.

The first major change to the ship of the line concept was the introduction of [[steam power]] as an auxiliary [[marine propulsion|propulsion system]]. Steam power was gradually introduced to the navy in the first half of the 19th century, initially for small craft and later for [[frigate]]s. The [[French Navy]] introduced steam to the line of battle with the 90-gun [[French ship Napoléon (1850)|''Le Napoléon'']] in 1850&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Napoleon (90 guns), the first purpose-designed screw line of battleships&quot;, ''Steam, Steel and Shellfire'', Conway's History of the Ship (p. 39)&lt;/ref&gt;—the first true steam battleship.&lt;ref&gt;''&quot;Hastened to completion Le Napoleon was launched on 16 May 1850, to become the world's first true steam battleship&quot;'', ''Steam, Steel and Shellfire'', Conway's History of the Ship (p39)&lt;/ref&gt; ''Napoleon'' was armed as a conventional ship-of-the-line, but her steam engines could give her a speed of {{convert|12|kn|km/h|0}}, regardless of the wind conditions: a potentially decisive advantage in a naval engagement. The introduction of steam accelerated the growth in size of battleships. France and the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] were the only countries to develop [[List of steam powered ships of the line|fleets of wooden steam screw battleships]], although several other navies operated small numbers of screw battleships, including [[Russian Empire|Russia]] (9), [[Ottoman Empire|Turkey]] (3), [[Sweden]] (2), [[Kingdom of Naples|Naples]] (1), [[Denmark]] (1) and [[Austrian Empire|Austria]] (1).&lt;ref name=LambertBIT&gt;Lambert, Andrew, ''Battleships in Transition'', pub Conway1984, ISBN 0-85177-315-X pages 144-147.&lt;br /&gt; In addition, the Navy of the North Germany Confederacy (which included Prussia) bought [[HMS Renown (1857)|HMS ''Renown'']] from Britain in 1870 for use as a gunnery training ship.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sondhaus&quot;/&gt;

==Ironclads==
{{Main|Ironclad warship}}
[[Image:LaGloirePhotograph.jpg|thumb|The French [[French battleship La Gloire|''La Gloire'']] (1859), the first ocean–going [[ironclad warship]]]]

The adoption of steam power was only one of a number of technological advances which revolutionized warship design in the 19th century. The ship of the line was overtaken by the [[ironclad warship|ironclad]]: powered by steam, protected by metal armor, and armed with guns firing high-explosive [[shell (projectile)|shells]].

===Explosive shells===
Guns which fired explosive or incendiary shells were a major threat to wooden ships, and these weapons quickly became widespread after the introduction of 8&amp;nbsp;inch shell guns as part of the standard armament of French and American line-of-battle ships in 1841.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The canon-obusier [shell gun] originally constructed by [[Henri-Joseph Paixhans|Colonel Paixhans]] for the French Naval Service... was subsequently designated the canon-obusier of 80, No 1 of 1841... the diameter of the bore is 22 centimetres (8.65 inches).&quot;  See: [[Howard Douglas|Douglas, Sir Howard]], ''A Treatise on Naval Gunnery 1855'', 4th Edition 1855, republished Conway Maritime Press, 1982, ISBN 0-85177-275-7 page 201.&lt;br /&gt;The British undertook trials with shell guns trials at HMS ''Excellent'' starting in 1832.  ''A Treatise on Naval Gunnery 1855'' page 198.&lt;br /&gt;For the US introduction of 8-inch shell guns into the armament of line-of-battle ships in 1841, see: Tucker, Spencer, ''Arming the Fleet, US Navy Ordnance in the Muzzle-Loading Era'', pub US Naval Institute, 1989,ISBN 0-87021-007-6 page 149.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Crimean War]], six line-of-battle ships and two frigates of the Russian [[Black Sea Fleet]] destroyed seven Turkish frigates and three corvettes with explosive shells at the [[Battle of Sinop]] in 1853.&lt;ref&gt;Lambert, Andrew D, ''The Crimean War, British Grand Strategy Against Russia, 1853-56'', pub Manchester University Press, 1990, ISBN 0-7190-3564-3, pages 60-61.&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the war, French ironclad floating batteries used similar weapons against the defenses at the [[Battle of Kinburn (1855)|Battle of Kinburn]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Lambert&quot;&gt;Lambert, Andrew: ''Battleships in Transition'', pp. 92–96&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless wooden-hulled ships stood up comparatively well to shells, as shown in the 1866 [[Battle of Lissa (1866)|Battle of Lissa]], where the modern Austrian steam two-decker ''Kaiser'' ranged across a confused battlefield, rammed an [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Italian]] ironclad and took 80 hits from Italian ironclads,&lt;ref&gt;Clowes, William Laird, ''Four Modern Naval Campaigns'', pub Unit Library, 1902, republished Cornmarket Press, 1970, ISBN 0-7191-2020-9 page 68.&lt;/ref&gt; many of which were shells,&lt;ref&gt;Clowes, William Laird, ''Four Modern Naval Campaigns''pages 54-55 and 63.&lt;/ref&gt; but including at least one 300&amp;nbsp;[[pound (mass)|pound]] shot at point blank range. Despite losing her [[bowsprit]] and her foremast, and being set on fire, she was ready for action again the very next day.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson&quot;&gt;Wilson, H. W.: ''Ironclads in Action - Vol 1'', London, 1898, p. 240&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iron armor and construction===
[[Image:Hms warrior.jpg|thumb|{{HMS|Warrior|1860|6}} (1860), the Royal Navy's first ocean–going iron hulled warship.]]

The development of high-explosive shells made the use of iron [[armour|armor]] plate on warships necessary. In 1859 [[France]] launched [[French battleship La Gloire|''La Gloire'']], the first ocean-going ironclad warship. She had the profile of a ship of the line, cut to one deck due to weight considerations. Although made of wood and reliant on sail for most journeys, ''La Gloire'' was fitted with a propeller, and her wooden hull was protected by a layer of thick iron armor.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbons, Tony: ''The Complete Encyclopedia of Battleships'', pp. 28–29&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gloire'' prompted further innovation from the [[Royal Navy]], anxious to prevent France from gaining a technological lead.

The superior armored frigate [[HMS Warrior (1860)|''Warrior'']] followed ''La Gloire'' by only 14 months, and both nations embarked on a program of building new ironclads and converting existing screw ships of the line to armored frigates.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbons, pp. 30–31&lt;/ref&gt; Within two years, Italy, Austria, [[Spanish Empire|Spain]] and Russia had all ordered ironclad warships, and by the time of the famous clash of the [[USS Monitor|USS ''Monitor'']] and the [[CSS Virginia|CSS ''Virginia'']] at the [[Battle of Hampton Roads]] at least eight navies possessed ironclad ships.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sondhaus&quot;/&gt;

[[Image:LeRedoutablePhoto.jpg|thumb|The French [[French battleship Redoutable (1876)|''Redoutable'']] (1876), the first battleship to use steel as the main building material&lt;ref&gt;Gibbons, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Navies experimented with the positioning of guns, in [[Gun turret|turrets]] (like the USS ''Monitor''), [[central battery ship|central-batteries]] or [[barbette]]s, or with the [[naval ram|ram]] as the principal weapon. As steam technology developed, masts were gradually removed from battleship designs. By the mid-1870s [[steel]] was used as a construction material alongside iron and wood. The French Navy's [[French battleship Redoutable (1876)|''Redoutable'']], laid down in 1873 and launched in 1876, was a central [[artillery battery|battery]] and barbette warship which became the first battleship in the world to use steel as the principal building material.&lt;ref&gt;Conway Marine, &quot;Steam, Steel and Shellfire&quot; (p. 96)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pre-dreadnought battleship===
{{Main|Pre-dreadnought battleship}}
[[File:USS Texas2.jpg|thumb|Pre-''Dreadnought'' battleship [[USS Texas (1892)|USS ''Texas'']], built in 1892, was the first battleship of the U.S. Navy.  [[Photochrom]] print c. 1898.]]
[[Image:HMS Agamemnon (1908) profile drawing.png|thumb|Diagram of {{HMS|Agamemnon|1906|6}} (1908), a typical late pre-dreadnought battleship]]

The term &quot;battleship&quot; was officially adopted by the Royal Navy in the re-classification of 1892. By the 1890s, there was an increasing similarity between battleship designs, and the type now known as the 'pre-dreadnought battleship' emerged. These were heavily armored ships, mounting a mixed battery of guns in turrets, and without sails. The typical first-class battleship of the pre-dreadnought era displaced 15,000 to 17,000&amp;nbsp;[[ton]]s, had a speed of {{convert|16|kn|km/h|0}}, and an armament of four {{convert|12|in|mm|0|sing=on}} guns in two turrets fore and aft with a mixed-caliber secondary battery amidships around the superstructure.&lt;ref name = &quot;Stoll&quot;/&gt; An early design with superficial similarity to the pre-dreadnought is the British [[Devastation class battleship|''Devastation''-class]] of 1871.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbons, Tony: ''The Complete Encyclopedia of Battleships'', p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was not until the 1890s that the widespread adoption of steel construction and hardened steel armor meant that a turret-ship could combine heavy armament and protection with high speed and good sea keeping.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

The slow-firing {{convert|12|in|mm|0|sing=on}} main guns were the principal weapons for battleship-to-battleship combat. The intermediate and secondary batteries had two roles. Against major ships, it was thought a 'hail of fire' from quick-firing secondary weapons could distract enemy gun crews by inflicting damage to the superstructure, and they would be more effective against smaller ships such as [[cruiser]]s. Smaller guns (12-pounders and smaller) were reserved for protecting the battleship against the threat of torpedo attack from [[destroyer]]s and [[torpedo boat]]s.&lt;ref&gt;War at Sea in the Ironclad Age, Richard Hill, ISBN 0-304-35273-X.&lt;/ref&gt;

The beginning of the pre-dreadnought era coincided with Britain reasserting her naval dominance. For many years previously, Britain had taken naval supremacy for granted. Expensive naval projects were criticised by political leaders of all inclinations.&lt;ref name = &quot;Sondhaus&quot;/&gt; However, in 1888 a war scare with France and the build-up of the Russian navy gave added impetus to naval construction, and the British Naval Defence Act of 1889 laid down a new fleet including eight new battleships. The principle that Britain's navy should be more powerful than the two next most powerful fleets combined was established. This policy was designed to deter France and Russia from building more battleships, but both nations nevertheless expanded their fleets with more and better pre-dreadnoughts in the 1890s.&lt;ref name = &quot;Sondhaus&quot;/&gt;

In the last years of the 19th century and the first years of the 20th, the escalation in the building of battleships became an [[arms race]] between Britain and [[German Empire|Germany]]. The German naval laws of 1890 and 1898 authorised a fleet of 38 battleships, a vital threat to the balance of naval power.&lt;ref name = &quot;Sondhaus&quot;/&gt; Britain answered with further shipbuilding, but by the end of the pre-dreadnought era, British supremacy at sea had markedly weakened. In 1883, the United Kingdom had 38 battleships, twice as many as France and almost as many as the rest of the world put together. By 1897, Britain's lead was far smaller due to competition from France, Germany, and Russia, as well as the development of pre-dreadnought fleets in Italy, the [[United States]] and [[Empire of Japan|Japan]].&lt;ref name=k209&gt;Kennedy, p. 209&lt;/ref&gt; Turkey, Spain, Sweden, Denmark, [[Norway]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Chile]] and [[Brazil]] all had second-rate fleets led by [[armored cruiser]]s, [[coastal defence ship]]s or [[monitor (warship)|monitors]].&lt;ref&gt;Preston, Anthony: ''Jane's Fighting Ships of World War II''&lt;/ref&gt;

Pre-dreadnoughts continued the technical innovations of the ironclad. Turrets, armor plate, and [[steam engine]]s were all improved over the years, and [[torpedo]] tubes were introduced. A small number of designs, including the American [[Kearsarge class battleship|''Kearsarge'']] and [[Virginia class battleship|''Virginia'']] classes, experimented with all or part of the 8-inch intermediate battery superimposed over the 12-inch primary. Results were poor: recoil factors and blast effects resulted in the 8-inch battery being completely unusable, and the inability to train the primary and intermediate armaments on different targets led to significant tactical limitations. Even though such innovative designs saved weight (a key reason for their inception), they proved too cumbersome in practice.&lt;ref&gt;Preston, Anthony. (1972) ''Battleships of World War I'', New York City: Galahad Books&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dreadnought era==
{{See also|Dreadnought}}
In 1906, the British [[Royal Navy]] launched the revolutionary {{HMS|Dreadnought|1906|6}}. Created as a result of pressure from Admiral [[John Fisher, 1st Baron Fisher|Sir John (&quot;Jackie&quot;) Fisher]], HMS ''Dreadnought'' made existing battleships obsolete. Combining an &quot;all-big-gun&quot; armament of ten 12-inch (305&amp;nbsp;mm) guns with unprecedented speed and protection, she prompted navies worldwide to re-evaluate their battleship building programmes. While the Japanese had laid down an all-big-gun battleship, ''Satsuma'' in 1904,&lt;ref&gt;Gibbons, p. 168&lt;/ref&gt; and the concept of an all-big-gun ship had been in circulation for several years, it had yet to be validated in combat. ''Dreadnought'' sparked a new [[arms race]], principally between Britain and Germany but reflected worldwide, as the new class of warships became a crucial element of national power.

Technical development continued rapidly through the dreadnought era, with step changes in armament, armor and propulsion. Ten years after ''Dreadnought''{{'}}s commissioning, much more powerful ships, the super-dreadnoughts, were being built.

===Origin===
[[Image:Vittoriocuniberti001.jpg|thumb|upright|Vittorio Cuniberti]]
In the first years of the 20th century, several navies worldwide experimented with the idea of a new type of battleship with a uniform armament of very heavy guns.

Admiral [[Vittorio Cuniberti]], the Italian Navy's chief naval architect, articulated the concept of an all-big-gun battleship in 1903. When the ''[[Regia Marina]]'' did not pursue his ideas, Cuniberti wrote an article in [[Jane's Fighting Ships|''Jane's'']] proposing an &quot;ideal&quot; future British battleship, a large armored warship of 17,000&amp;nbsp;tons, armed solely with a single calibre main battery (twelve 12-inch {305&amp;nbsp;mm} guns), carrying {{convert|300|mm|in|0|sing=on}} [[belt armor]], and capable of 24 [[knot (unit)|knots]] (44&amp;nbsp;km/h).&lt;ref&gt;Cuniberti, Vittorio, &quot;An Ideal Battleship for the British Fleet&quot;, ''All The World's Fighting Ships'', 1903, pp. 407–409.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Russo-Japanese War]] provided operational experience to validate the 'all-big-gun' concept. At the [[Battle of the Yellow Sea|Yellow Sea]] and [[Battle of Tsushima|Tsushima]], pre-dreadnoughts exchanged volleys at ranges of 7,600–12,000 yd (7 to 11&amp;nbsp;km), beyond the range of the secondary batteries. It is often held that these engagements demonstrated the importance of the {{convert|12|in|mm|0|sing=on}} gun over its smaller counterparts, though some historians take the view that secondary batteries were just as important as the larger weapons.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sondhaus&quot;/&gt;

In Japan, the two battleships of the 1903-4 Programme were the first to be laid down as all-big-gun designs, with eight 12-inch guns. However, the design had armor which was considered too thin, demanding a substantial redesign.&lt;ref&gt;Breyer, ''Battleships and Battlecruisers of the World'', p. 331.&lt;/ref&gt; The financial pressures of the Russo-Japanese War and the short supply of 12-inch guns which had to be imported from Britain meant these ships were completed with a mixed 10- and 12-inch armament. The 1903-4 design also retained traditional triple-expansion steam engines.&lt;ref&gt;Evans and Peattie, ''Kaigun'', p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:IJN Satsuma.jpg|thumb|left|A preliminary design for the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]]'s {{ship|Japanese battleship|Satsuma||2}} was an &quot;all-big-gun&quot; design.]]
As early as 1904, Jackie Fisher had been convinced of the need for fast, powerful ships with an all-big-gun armament. If Tsushima influenced his thinking, it was to persuade him of the need to standardise on {{convert|12|in|mm|0|sing=on}} guns.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sondhaus&quot;/&gt; Fisher's concerns were [[submarine]]s and [[destroyer]]s equipped with torpedoes, then threatening to outrange battleship guns, making speed imperative for [[capital ship]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sondhaus&quot;/&gt; Fisher's preferred option was his brainchild, the [[battlecruiser]]: lightly armored but heavily armed with eight 12-inch guns and propelled to {{convert|25|kn|km/h|0}} by [[steam turbine]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=British Battlecruisers 1914–18 |last=Burr |first=Lawrence |year=2006 |publisher=Osprey Publishing |location=Oxford |isbn=1-84603-008-0 |pages=4–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was to prove this revolutionary technology that ''Dreadnought'' was designed in January 1905, laid down in October 1905 and sped to completion by 1906. She carried ten 12-inch guns, had an 11-inch armor belt, and was the first large ship powered by turbines. She mounted her guns in five turrets; three on the centerline (one forward, two aft) and two on the [[Gun turret|wings]], giving her at her launch twice the [[broadside]] of anything else afloat. She retained a number of 12-pound (3-inch, 76&amp;nbsp;mm) [[British ordnance terms#QF|quick-firing]] guns for use against destroyers and torpedo-boats. Her armor was heavy enough for her to go head-to-head with any other ship afloat in a gun battle, and conceivably win.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbons, pp. 170–171.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:HMS Dreadnought (1911) profile drawing.png|thumb|left|{{HMS|Dreadnought|1906|6}} (1906)|left]]

''Dreadnought'' was to have been followed by three [[Invincible class battlecruiser|''Invincible'']]-class [[battlecruiser]]s, their construction delayed to allow lessons from ''Dreadnought'' to be used in their design. While Fisher may have intended ''Dreadnought'' to be the last Royal Navy battleship,&lt;ref name=&quot;Sondhaus&quot;/&gt; the design was so successful he found little support for his plan to switch to a battlecruiser navy. Although there were some problems with the ship (the wing turrets had limited arcs of fire and strained the hull when firing a full broadside, and the top of the thickest armor belt lay below the waterline at full load), the Royal Navy promptly commissioned another six ships to a similar design in the [[Bellerophon class battleship|''Bellerophon'']] and [[St. Vincent class battleship|''St Vincent'']] classes.

An American design, {{USS|South Carolina|BB-26|2}}, authorized in 1905 and laid down in December 1906, was another of the first dreadnoughts, but she and her sister, {{USS|Michigan|BB-27|2}}, were not launched until 1908. Both used triple-expansion engines and had a superior layout of the main battery, dispensing with ''Dreadnought'''s wing turrets. They thus retained the same broadside, despite having two fewer guns.

===Arms race===
{{see also|World War I naval arms race}}
In 1897, before the revolution in design brought about by ''HMS Dreadnought'', the Royal Navy had 62 battleships in commission or building, a lead of 26 over France and 50 over Germany.&lt;ref name=k209/&gt; In 1906, the Royal Navy owned the field with ''Dreadnought''. The new class of ship prompted an arms race with major strategic consequences. Major naval powers raced to build their own dreadnoughts. Possession of modern battleships was not only vital to naval power, but also, as with nuclear weapons today, represented a nation's standing in the world.&lt;ref name = &quot;Sondhaus&quot;/&gt; Germany, France, Russia, Italy, Austria, and the United States all began dreadnought programmes; and second-rank powers including Turkey, [[Argentina]], Brazil, and Chile commissioned dreadnoughts to be built in British and American yards.&lt;ref&gt;Keegan, p. 281&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War I==
{{See also|Naval warfare of World War I}}
The First World War was an anticlimax for the great dreadnought fleets. There was no decisive clash of modern battlefleets to compare with the [[Battle of Tsushima]]. The role of battleships was marginal to the great land struggle in France and Russia; and it was equally marginal to the [[First Battle of the Atlantic]], the battle between [[U-boat|German submarines]] and British merchant shipping.

[[Image:Hochseeflotte 1.jpg|thumb|225px|left|German [[High Seas Fleet]] during [[World War I]]]]

By virtue of geography, the Royal Navy could keep the German [[High Seas Fleet]] bottled up in the [[North Sea]]: only narrow channels led to the Atlantic Ocean and these were guarded by British forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gilbert|first=Adrian|title=The encyclopedia of warfare: from earliest time to the present day, Part 25|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=2000|pages=224|isbn=978-1-57958-216-6|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=MZoO7SIwMVIC&amp;pg=PA224&amp;dq=%22world+war+i%22+%22high+seas+fleet%22+%22royal+navy%22+%22north+sea%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3#v=onepage&amp;q=%22world%20war%20i%22%20%22high%20seas%20fleet%22%20%22royal%20navy%22%20%22north%20sea%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both sides were aware that, because of the greater number of British dreadnoughts, a full fleet engagement would be likely to result in a British victory. The German strategy was therefore to try to provoke an engagement on their terms: either to induce a part of the Grand Fleet to enter battle alone, or to fight a pitched battle near the German coastline, where friendly minefields, torpedo-boats and submarines could be used to even the odds.&lt;ref&gt;Keegan, p. 289.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first two years of war saw conflict in the North Sea limited to skirmishes by [[battlecruiser]]s at the [[Battle of Heligoland Bight]] and [[Battle of Dogger Bank (1915)|Battle of Dogger Bank]] and raids on the English coast. On May 31, 1916, a further attempt to draw British ships into battle on German terms resulted in a clash of the battlefleets in the [[Battle of Jutland]].&lt;ref&gt;Ireland, Bernard: ''Jane's War At Sea'', pp. 88–95.&lt;/ref&gt; The German fleet withdrew to port at its earliest opportunity after two short encounters with the British fleet. This reinforced German determination never to engage in a fleet to fleet battle.&lt;ref&gt;Padfield 1972, p. 240.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the other naval theatres there were no decisive pitched battles. In the [[Black Sea]], engagement between [[Russian Empire|Russian]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish]] battleships was restricted to skirmishes. In the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]], action was largely limited to the raiding of convoys, and the laying of defensive minefields; the only significant clash of battleship squadrons there was the [[Battle of Moon Sound]] at which one Russian pre-dreadnought was lost. The [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] was in a sense the mirror of the North Sea: the [[Austria–Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] dreadnought fleet remained bottled up by the British and French blockade. And in the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]], the most important use of battleships was in support of the amphibious assault on [[Gallipoli Campaign|Gallipoli]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrew Marr's The Making of Modern Britain]] Episode 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The war illustrated the vulnerability of battleships to cheaper weapons. In September 1914, the potential threat posed to [[capital ship]]s by German U-boats was confirmed by successful attacks on British cruisers, including the sinking of three British [[armored cruiser]]s by the German submarine [[SM U-9|U-9]] in less than an hour. Sea mines proved a threat the next month, when the recently commissioned British super-dreadnought [[HMS Audacious (1912)|''Audacious'']] struck a mine and sank. By the end of October, the British had changed their strategy and tactics in the North Sea to reduce the risk of U-boat attack.&lt;ref&gt;Massie, Robert. ''Castles of Steel'', London, 2005. pp. 127–145&lt;/ref&gt; The German plan for the [[Battle of Jutland]] relied on U-boat attacks on the British fleet; and the escape of the German fleet from the superior British firepower at Jutland was effected by the German cruisers and destroyers closing on British battleships, causing them to turn away to avoid the threat of torpedo attack.&lt;ref&gt;Massie, Robert. ''Castles of Steel'', London, 2005. pp. 675&lt;/ref&gt; Further near-misses from submarine attacks on battleships and casualties amongst cruisers led to growing concern in the Royal Navy about the vulnerability of battleships. By October 1916, the Royal Navy instructed the Grand Fleet not to go south of the [[Farne Islands]] unless adequately protected by destroyers.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

The German High Seas Fleet, for their part, were determined not to engage the British without the assistance of submarines; and since the submarines were needed more for raiding commercial traffic, the fleet stayed in port for the remainder of the war.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, pp. 247&amp;ndash;249&lt;/ref&gt; Other theatres equally showed the role of small craft in damaging or destroying dreadnoughts: [[SMS Szent István|SMS ''Szent István'']] of the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] was sunk by [[Regia Marina|Italian]] [[motor torpedo boats]] in June 1918, while her sister ship, [[SMS Viribus Unitis|SMS ''Viribus Unitis'']] was sunk by [[frogman|frogmen]]. The [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] capital ships lost in Gallipoli were sunk by mines and torpedo,&lt;ref&gt;{{HMS|Majestic|1895|6}} and {{HMS|Triumph|1903|6}} were torpedoed by ''U.21''; {{HMS|Goliath|1898|6}} was torpedoed by the Turkish torpedo boat ''Muavenet''.&lt;/ref&gt; while a Turkish pre-dreadnought, ''Messudieh'' was caught in the [[Dardanelles]] by a British submarine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Submarines at War 1914-18 |last= Compton-Hall |first= Richard|year= 2004 |publisher= Periscope Publishing Ltd |isbn=1-904381-21-9 |pages=155–162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inter-war period==

For many years, [[Weimar Republic|Germany]] simply had no battleships. The [[Armistice with Germany (Compiègne)|Armistice with Germany]] required that most of the High Seas Fleet be disarmed and interned in a neutral port; largely because no neutral port could be found, the ships remained in British custody in [[Scapa Flow]], [[Scotland]]. The [[Treaty of Versailles]] specified that the ships should be handed over to the British. Instead, most of them were [[scuttling|scuttled]] by their German crews on 21 June 1919 just before the signature of the peace treaty. The treaty also limited the German Navy, and prevented Germany from building or possessing any [[capital ship]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Ireland, Bernard: ''Jane's War At Sea'', p. 118&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:HMS Nelson (1931) profile drawing.png|thumb|left|Profile drawing of [[HMS Nelson (28)|HMS ''Nelson'']] commissioned 1927]]
The inter-war period saw the battleship subjected to strict international limitations to prevent a costly arms race breaking out.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Norman, ''U.S. Battleships'', pp. 181&amp;ndash;2&lt;/ref&gt;

While the victors were not limited by the Treaty of Versailles, many of the major naval powers were crippled after the war. Faced with the prospect of a naval arms race against the United Kingdom and Japan, which would in turn have led to a possible Pacific war, the United States was keen to conclude the [[Washington Naval Treaty]] of 1922. This treaty limited the number and size of battleships that each major nation could possess, and required Britain to accept parity with the U.S. and to abandon the British alliance with Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, p. 277&lt;/ref&gt; The Washington treaty was followed by a series of other naval treaties, including the [[Geneva Naval Conference|First Geneva Naval Conference]] (1927), the [[London Naval Treaty|First London Naval Treaty]] (1930), the [[Second Geneva Naval Conference]] (1932), and finally the [[Second London Naval Treaty]] (1936), which all set limits on major warships. These treaties became effectively obsolete on 1 September 1939 at the beginning of [[World War II]], but the ship classifications that had been agreed upon still apply.&lt;ref&gt;Ireland, Bernard: ''Jane's War At Sea'', pp. 124–126, 139–142&lt;/ref&gt; The treaty limitations meant that fewer new battleships were launched from 1919–1939 than from 1905–1914. The treaties also inhibited development by putting maximum limits on the weights of ships. Designs like the projected British [[N3 class battleship]], the first American [[South Dakota class battleship (1920)|''South Dakota''-class]], and the Japanese [[Kii class battleship|''Kii''-class]]—all of which continued the trend to larger ships with bigger guns and thicker armor—never got off the drawing board. Those designs which were commissioned during this period were referred to as [[treaty battleship]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Sumrall, Robert: ''The Battleship and Battlecruiser'', in Gardiner, R: ''The Eclipse of the Big Gun''.

===Rise of air power===
[[Image:Ostfriesland bombed by Mitchells team p19.jpg|thumb|Bombing tests which sank [[SMS Ostfriesland|SMS ''Ostfriesland'']] (1909), September, 1921]]

As early as 1914, the British Admiral [[Percy Scott]] predicted that battleships would soon be made irrelevant by [[military aviation|aeroplanes]].&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, p. 199&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of World War I, aeroplanes had successfully adopted the torpedo as a weapon.&lt;ref&gt;From the ''Guinness Book of Air Facts and Feats ''(3rd edition, 1977): &quot;The first air attack using a torpedo dropped by an aeroplane was carried out by Flight Commander [[Charles H. K. Edmonds]], flying a [[Short Type 184|Short 184]] seaplane from HMS ''Ben-My-Chree'' on 12 August 1915, against a 5,000 ton (5,080 tonne) Turkish supply ship in the [[Sea of Marmara]]. Although the enemy ship was hit and sunk, the captain of a British submarine claimed to have fired a torpedo simultaneously and sunk the ship. It was further stated that the British submarine E14 had attacked and immobilised the ship four days earlier. However, on 17 August 1915, another Turkish ship was sunk by a torpedo of whose origin there can be no doubt. On this occasion Flight Commander C. H. Edmonds, flying a Short 184, torpedoed a Turkish steamer a few miles north of the Dardanelles. His formation colleague, Flight Lieutenant G. B. Dacre, was forced to land on the water owing to engine trouble but, seeing an enemy tug close by, taxied up to it and released his torpedo. The tug blew up and sank. Thereafter, Dacre was able to take off and return to the ''Ben-My-Chree''&lt;/ref&gt; A proposed attack on the German fleet at anchor in 1918 using the [[Sopwith Cuckoo]] carrier-borne torpedo-bomber was considered and rejected—but it was not long before such a technique was adopted.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

In the 1920s, General [[Billy Mitchell]] of the [[United States Army Air Corps]], believing that air forces had rendered navies around the world obsolete, testified in front of Congress that &quot;1,000 bombardment airplanes can be built and operated for about the price of one battleship&quot; and that a squadron of these bombers could sink a battleship, making for more efficient use of government funds.&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter J. Boyne|Boyne, Walter J.]] [http://www.airforce-magazine.com/MagazineArchive/Pages/1996/June%201996/0696billy.aspx &quot;The Spirit of Billy Mitchell&quot;]. Air Force Magazine, June 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; This infuriated the U.S. Navy, but Mitchell was nevertheless allowed to conduct a careful series of bombing tests alongside Navy and [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]] bombers. In 1921, he bombed and sank numerous ships, including the &quot;unsinkable&quot; German World War I battleship [[SMS Ostfriesland|''Ostfriesland'']] and the American pre-dreadnought {{USS|Alabama|BB-8|2}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/library/online/navybomb2.htm |title=Vice Admiral Alfred Wilkinson Johnson, USN Ret. '&amp;#39;The Naval Bombing Experiments: Bombing Operations'&amp;#39; (1959) |publisher=History.navy.mil |date= |accessdate=2009-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Mitchell had required &quot;war-time conditions&quot;, the ships sunk were obsolete, stationary, defenseless and had no damage control. The sinking of ''Ostfriesland'' was accomplished by violating an agreement that would have allowed Navy engineers to examine the effects of various munitions: Mitchell's airmen disregarded the rules, and sank the ship within minutes in a coordinated attack. The stunt made headlines, and Mitchell declared, &quot;No surface vessels can exist wherever air forces acting from land bases are able to attack them.&quot; While far from conclusive, Mitchell's test was significant because it put proponents of the battleship against naval aviation on the back foot.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sondhaus&quot;/&gt; Rear Admiral [[William A. Moffett]] used public relations against Mitchell to make headway toward expansion of the U.S. Navy's nascent aircraft carrier program.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffers, H. Paul (2006).

===Rearmament===
The [[Royal Navy]], [[United States Navy]], and [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] extensively upgraded and modernized their World War I–era battleships during the 1930s. Among the new features were an increased tower height and stability for the optical rangefinder equipment (for gunnery control), more armor (especially around turrets) to protect against plunging fire and aerial bombing, and additional anti-aircraft weapons. Some British ships received a large block superstructure nicknamed the &quot;Queen Anne's castle&quot;, such as in the ''[[HMS Queen Elizabeth (1913)|Queen Elizabeth]]'' and ''[[HMS Warspite (03)|Warspite]]'', which would be used in the new conning towers of the ''[[King George V class battleship (1939)|King George V]]'' [[fast battleship]]s. External bulges were added to improve both buoyancy to counteract weight increase and provide underwater protection against mines and torpedoes. The Japanese rebuilt all of their battleships, plus their battlecruisers, with distinctive &quot;[[pagoda]]&quot; structures, though the {{ship|Japanese battleship|Hiei||2}} received a more modern bridge tower that would influence the new ''[[Yamato class battleship|Yamato]]'' battleships. Bulges were fitted, including steel tube array to improve both underwater and vertical protection along waterline. The U.S. experimented with [[Lattice mast|cage masts]] and later tripod masts, though after [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]] some of the most severely damaged ships such as [[USS West Virginia (BB-48)|''West Virginia'']] and [[USS California (BB-44)|''California'']] were rebuilt to a similar appearance to their [[Iowa class battleship|''Iowa'' class]] contemporaries (called tower masts). Radar, which was effective beyond visual contact and was effective in complete darkness or adverse weather conditions, was introduced to supplement optical fire control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.combinedfleet.com/b_fire.htm |title=CombinedFleet.com |publisher=Combinedfleet.com |date= |accessdate=2009-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even when war threatened again in the late 1930s, battleship construction did not regain the level of importance which it had held in the years before World War I. The &quot;building holiday&quot; imposed by the naval treaties meant that the building capacity of dockyards worldwide was relatively reduced, and the strategic position had changed. The development of the [[strategic bomber]] meant that the navy was no longer the only method of projecting power overseas, and the development of the [[aircraft carrier]] meant that battleships had a rival for the resources available for capital ship construction.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

In [[Nazi Germany|Germany]], the ambitious [[Plan Z]] for naval rearmament was abandoned in favour of a strategy of submarine warfare supplemented by the use of battlecruisers and [[Bismarck class battleship|''Bismarck'']]-class battleships as commerce raiders. In Britain, the most pressing need was for air defenses and convoy escorts to safeguard the civilian population from bombing or starvation, and re-armament construction plans consisted of five ships of the [[King George V class battleship (1939)|''King George V'']] class. It was in the Mediterranean that navies remained most committed to battleship warfare. France intended to build six battleships of the [[Dunkerque class battleship|''Dunkerque'']] and [[Richelieu class battleship|''Richelieu'']] classes, and the Italians two [[Littorio class battleship|''Littorio'']]-class ships. Neither navy built significant aircraft carriers. The U.S. preferred to spend limited funds on aircraft carriers until the [[South Dakota class battleship (1939)|''South Dakota'']] class. Japan, also prioritising aircraft carriers, nevertheless began work on three mammoth [[Yamato class battleship|''Yamato'']]-class ships (although the third, [[Japanese aircraft carrier Shinano|''Shinano'']], was later completed as a carrier) and a planned fourth was cancelled.&lt;ref name = &quot;Lenton&quot;/&gt;

At the outbreak of the [[Spanish Civil War]], the [[Second Spanish Republic|Spanish]] navy consisted of only two small dreadnought battleships, [[Spanish battleship Alfonso XIII|España]] and [[Spanish battleship Jaime I|Jaime I]]. ''España'' (originally named ''Alfonso XIII''), by then in reserve at the northwestern naval base of [[Ferrol, Spain|El Ferrol]], fell into [[Spain under Franco|Nationalist]] hands in July 1936. The crew aboard ''Jaime I'' murdered their officers, mutinied, and joined the Republican Navy. Thus each side had one battleship; however, the Republican Navy generally lacked experienced officers. The Spanish battleships mainly restricted themselves to mutual blockades, convoy escort duties, and shore bombardment, rarely in direct fighting against other surface units.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbons, p.195&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1937, ''España'' ran onto a mine laid by friendly forces, and sank with little loss of life. In May 1937, ''Jaime I'' was damaged by Nationalist air attacks and a grounding incident. The ship was forced to go back to port to be repaired. There she was again hit by several aerial bombs. It was then decided to tow the battleship to a more secure port, but during the transport she suffered an internal explosion that caused 300 deaths and her total loss. Several Italian and German capital ships participated in the non-intervention blockade. On 29 May 1937, two Republican aircraft managed to bomb the German pocket battleship {{ship|German battleship|Deutschland||2}} outside [[Ibiza]], causing severe damage and loss of life. {{ship|German battleship|Admiral Scheer||2}} retaliated two days later by bombarding [[Almería]], causing much destruction, and the resulting [[Deutschland incident (1937)|''Deutschland'' incident]] meant the end of German and Italian support for non-intervention.&lt;ref&gt;Greger, René. ''Schlachtschiffe der Welt'', p. 251&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War II==
{{Main|Battleships in World War II}}
[[Image:USS Pennsylvania moving into Lingayen Gulf.jpg|thumb|right|{{USS|Pennsylvania|BB-38|2}} leading battleship {{USS|Colorado|BB-45|2}} and cruisers {{USS|Louisville|CA-28|2}}, {{USS|Portland|CA-33|2}}, and {{USS|Columbia|CL-56|2}} into [[Lingayen Gulf]], [[Philippines]], January 1945]]

The German battleship {{Ship|German battleship|Schleswig-Holstein||2}}—an obsolete [[pre-dreadnought]]—fired the first shots of World War II with the bombardment of the Polish garrison at [[Westerplatte]];&lt;ref&gt;Gibbons, p. 163&lt;/ref&gt; and the final surrender of the Japanese Empire took place aboard a United States Navy battleship, {{USS|Missouri|BB-63|2}}. Between those two events, it had become clear that aircraft carriers were the new principal ships of the fleet and that battleships now performed a secondary role.

Battleships played a part in major engagements in Atlantic, Pacific and Mediterranean theatres; in the Atlantic, the Germans used their battleships as independent commerce raiders. However, clashes between battleships were of little strategic importance. The [[Battle of the Atlantic (1939–1945)|Battle of the Atlantic]] was fought between destroyers and submarines, and most of the decisive fleet clashes of the Pacific war were determined by [[aircraft carrier]]s.

In the first year of the war, armored warships defied predictions that aircraft would dominate naval warfare. [[German battleship Scharnhorst|''Scharnhorst'']] and [[German battleship Gneisenau|''Gneisenau'']] surprised and sank the aircraft carrier [[HMS Glorious|''Glorious'']] off western [[Norway]] in June 1940.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbons, pp. 246–247&lt;/ref&gt; This engagement marked the last time a fleet carrier was sunk by surface gunnery. In the [[Attack on Mers-el-Kébir]], British battleships opened fire on the French battleships harboured in Algiers with their own heavy guns, and later pursued fleeing French ships with planes from aircraft carriers.

The subsequent years of the war saw many demonstrations of the maturity of the aircraft carrier as a strategic naval weapon and its potential against battleships. The British air attack on the Italian naval base at [[Battle of Taranto|Taranto]] sank one Italian battleship and damaged two more. The same [[Fairey Swordfish|Swordfish]] torpedo bombers played a crucial role in sinking the German commerce-raider {{ship|German battleship|Bismarck||2}}.

[[Image:Yamato during Trial Service.jpg|thumb|The [[Imperial Japanese Navy]]'s [[Japanese battleship Yamato|''Yamato'']] (1940), seen in 1941, and her sister ship [[Japanese battleship Musashi|''Musashi'']] (1940) were the heaviest battleships in history.]]

On 7 December 1941 the Japanese launched a surprise [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]. Within a short time five of eight U.S. battleships were sunk or sinking, with the rest damaged. The American aircraft carriers were out to sea, however, and evaded detection. They in turn would take up the fight, eventually turning the tide of the war in the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]]. The [[Sinking of Prince of Wales and Repulse|sinking of the British battleship ''Prince of Wales'']] and her escort, the battlecruiser HMS ''Repulse'', demonstrated the vulnerability of a battleship to air attack while at sea without sufficient air cover, finally settling the argument begun by Mitchell in 1921. Both warships were under way and enroute to attack the Japanese amphibious force that had invaded [[Battle of Malaya|Malaya]] when they were caught by Japanese land-based [[bomber]]s and [[torpedo bomber]]s on 10 December 1941.&lt;ref&gt;Axell, Albert: ''Kamikaze'', p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

At many of the early crucial battles of the Pacific, for instance [[Battle of the Coral Sea|Coral Sea]] and [[Battle of Midway|Midway]], battleships were either absent or overshadowed as carriers launched wave after wave of planes into the attack at a range of hundreds of miles. In later battles in the Pacific, battleships primarily performed shore bombardment in support of amphibious landings and provided anti-aircraft defense as escort for the carriers. Even the largest battleships ever constructed, Japan's [[Yamato class battleship|''Yamato'' class]], which carried a main battery of nine 18-inch (46&amp;nbsp;cm) guns and were designed as a principal strategic weapon, were never given a chance to show their potential in the decisive battleship action that figured in Japanese pre-war planning.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbons, pp. 262&amp;ndash;263&lt;/ref&gt;

The last battleship confrontation in history was the [[Battle of Surigao Strait]], on October 25, 1944, in which the classic &quot;[[crossing the T]]&quot; tactic was employed for the last time to enable a superior American battleship group to decimate a lesser Japanese battleship group with concentration of fire directed by radar, however purists note that the early wave of torpedoes from American destroyers caused a crucial reduction in Japanese firepower, and those remaining lacked the ability to direct fire with radar. All but one of the American battleships in this confrontation had previously been sunk by the Attack on [[Pearl Harbor]] and subsequently raised and repaired. When [[USS Mississippi|''Mississippi'']] fired the last salvo of this battle, the last{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}&lt;!--not against ''Haruna''?--&gt;&lt;!--Battle off Samar, &quot;Haruna&quot; engaged Taffy 3--escort carriers &amp; destroyers, not equals---&gt; salvo fired by a battleship against another heavy ship, she was &quot;firing a funeral salute to a finished era of naval warfare.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Samuel Eliot Morison, ''History of US Naval Operations in World War II'' Vol. 12, ''Leyte'', p.141.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cold War==

After World War II, several navies retained their existing battleships, but they were no longer strategically dominant military assets. Indeed, it soon became apparent that they were no longer worth the considerable cost of construction and maintenance and only one new battleship was commissioned after the war, HMS Vanguard. During the war it had been demonstrated that battleship-on-battleship engagements like [[Battle of Leyte Gulf|Leyte Gulf]] or the sinking of {{HMS|Hood|51|2}} were the exception and not the rule, and with the growing role of aircraft engagement ranges were becoming longer and longer, making heavy gun armament irrelevant. The armor of a battleship was equally irrelevant in the face of a [[nuclear warfare|nuclear attack]] as tactical missiles with a range of {{convert|100|km|mi|-1}} or more could be mounted on the Soviet {{sclass|Kildin|destroyer}} and {{sclass|Whiskey|submarine}}. By the end of the 1950s, minor vessel classes which formerly offered no noteworthy opposition now were capable of eliminating battleships at will.

The remaining battleships met a variety of ends. {{USS|Arkansas|BB-33|6}} and {{ship|Japanese battleship|Nagato||2}} were sunk during the testing of nuclear weapons in [[Operation Crossroads]] in 1946. Both battleships proved resistant to nuclear air burst but vulnerable to underwater nuclear explosions.&lt;ref&gt;''Operation 'Crossroads' — the Bikini A-bomb tests'', in {{cite book  | last = Ireland  | first = Bernard  | title = Jane's Battleships of the 20th Century | publisher = HarperCollins | year = 1996 | location = New York | pages = 186–87 | isbn = 0-00-470997-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Italian [[Italian battleship Giulio Cesare|''Giulio Cesare'']] was taken by the Soviets as reparations and renamed ''Novorossiysk''; she was sunk by a German mine in the [[Black Sea]] on 29 October 1955.

Argentina kept its two [[Rivadavia class battleship|''Rivadavia'' class]] ships until 1956 and Chile kept [[Chilean battleship Almirante Latorre|''Almirante Latorre'']] (formerly HMS ''Canada'') until 1959.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzsimons, Volume 1, p.84, &quot;''Almirante Latorre''&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Turkey|Turkish]] battlecruiser ''Yavuz'' (formerly [[SMS Goeben|''Goeben'']], launched in 1911) was scrapped in 1976 after an offer to sell her back to Germany was refused.

[[Image:Missouri missile BGM-109 Tomahawk.JPG|thumb|{{USS|Missouri|BB-63|6}} launches a [[Tomahawk missile]] during ''Operation Desert Storm''.]]

The [[Iowa class battleship|''Iowa'' class battleships]] gained a new lease of life in the U.S. Navy as fire support ships. [[Radar]] and computer-controlled gunfire could be aimed with pinpoint accuracy to target. The U.S. recommissioned all four ''Iowa'' class battleships for the [[Korean War]] and the {{USS|New Jersey|BB-62|2}} for the [[Vietnam War]]. These were primarily used for shore bombardment, ''New Jersey'' firing nearly 6,000 rounds of 16&amp;nbsp;inch shells and over 14,000 rounds of 5&amp;nbsp;inch projectiles during her tour on the gunline,&lt;ref&gt;Polmar, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; seven times more rounds against shore targets in Vietnam than she had fired in the Second World War.&lt;ref&gt;History of World Seapower, Bernard Brett, ISBN 0-603-03723-2, p. 236&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Navy Secretary]] [[John F. Lehman]]'s effort to build a [[600-ship Navy]] in the 1980s, and in response to the commissioning of ''[[Soviet battlecruiser Kirov|Kirov]]'' by the Soviet Union, the United States recommissioned all four ''Iowa'' class battleships. On several occasions, battleships were support ships in [[carrier battle group]]s, or led their own [[battleship battle group]]. These were modernized to carry [[Tomahawk missile]]s, with ''New Jersey'' seeing action bombarding [[Lebanon]] in 1983 and 1984, while {{USS|Missouri|BB-63|2}} and {{USS|Wisconsin|BB-64|2}} fired their 16&amp;nbsp;inch (406&amp;nbsp;mm) guns at land targets and launched missiles during [[Operation Desert Storm]] in 1991. ''Wisconsin'' served as the [[BGM-109 Tomahawk|TLAM]] strike commander for the Persian Gulf, directing the sequence of launches that marked the opening of ''Desert Storm'', firing a total of 24 TLAMs during the first two days of the campaign. The primary threat to the battleships were Iraqi shore based surface-to-surface missiles; ''Missouri'' was targeted by two [[Iraq]]i [[Silkworm missile]]s, with one missing and another being intercepted by the British destroyer {{HMS|Gloucester|D96|6}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.global-defence.com/1997/DefencePower.html] Defence power: developments of the decade&lt;/ref&gt;

All four ''Iowas'' were decommissioned in the early 1990s, making them the last battleships to see active service. USS ''Iowa'' and USS ''Wisconsin'' were, until fiscal year 2006, maintained to a standard where they could be rapidly returned to service as fire support vessels, pending the development of a superior fire support vessel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ship/bb-61.htm|title= Iowa Class Battleship|accessdate=2007-03-18 |publisher = Federation of American Scientists}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Marine Corps believes that the current naval surface fire support gun and missile programs will not be able to provide adequate fire support for an [[amphibious warfare|amphibious assault]] or onshore operations.&lt;ref&gt;The USMC has revised its Naval Surface Gunfire Support requirements, leaving some questions as to whether or not the [[Zumwalt class destroyer]] can meet the Marine qualifications.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.fas.org/man/gao/gao95160.htm|title= Naval Surface Fires Support|author = United States General Accounting Office|accessdate=2007-03-18 |publisher = Federation of American Scientists}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern times==
[[Image:USS Texas BB-35.jpg|thumb|left|The American {{USS|Texas|BB-35|2}} (1912) is the only preserved example of a Dreadnought-type battleship that dates to the time of the original HMS ''Dreadnought''.]]

With the decommissioning of the last ''Iowa''-class ships, no battleships remain in service (including in reserve) with any navy worldwide. A number are preserved as [[museum ship]]s, either afloat or in drydock. The U.S. has a large number of battleships on display: {{USS|Massachusetts|BB-59|6}}, {{USS|North Carolina|BB-55|2}}, {{USS|Alabama|BB-60|2}}, {{USS|New Jersey|BB-62|2}}, {{USS|Wisconsin|BB-64|2}}, {{USS|Missouri|BB-63|2}} and {{USS|Texas|BB-35|2}}. ''Missouri'' and ''New Jersey'' are now museums at [[Pearl Harbor]] and [[Camden, New Jersey]], respectively. ''Wisconsin'' was removed from the [[Naval Vessel Register]] in 2006 and now serves as a museum ship in [[Norfolk, Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wavy.com/dpp/military/City-to-take-ownership-of-USS-Wisconsin-Friday &quot;WCBC files lawsuit&quot;].

==In strategy and doctrine==
===Doctrine===
Battleships were the embodiment of [[sea power]]. For [[Alfred Thayer Mahan]] and his followers, a strong navy was vital to the success of a nation, and control of the seas was vital for the projection of force on land and overseas. Mahan's theory, proposed in 1890's [[The Influence of Sea Power upon History|''The Influence of Sea Power Upon History, 1660-1783'']], dictated the role of the battleship was to sweep the enemy from the seas.&lt;ref&gt;Massie, Robert K. ''Castles of Steel'', London, 2005. ISBN 1-84413-411-3&lt;/ref&gt; While the work of escorting, [[blockade|blockading]], and raiding might be done by [[cruiser]]s or smaller vessels, the presence of the battleship was a potential threat to any convoy escorted by any vessels other than capital ships. (This concept came to be known as a &quot;[[fleet in being]]&quot;.) Mahan went on to say victory could only be achieved by engagements between battleships,&lt;ref&gt;Mahan, A.T., Captain. ''Influence of Sea Power on History, 1660–1783.'' (Boston: Little Brown), ''passim.''&lt;/ref&gt; (which came to be known as the &quot;decisive battle&quot; doctrine in [[Imperial Japanese Navy|some navies]]), while ''[[guerre de course]]'' (developed by the ''[[Jeune École]]'') could never succeed.

Mahan was highly influential in naval and political circles throughout the age of the battleship,&lt;ref name=&quot;Sondhaus&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, pp.2, 200, &amp; 206.&lt;/ref&gt; calling for a large fleet of the most powerful battleships possible. Mahan's work developed in the late 1880s, and by the end of the 1890s it had a massive international impact,&lt;ref name = &quot;Sondhaus&quot;/&gt; in the end adopted by many major navies (notably the British, American, German, and Japanese). The strength of Mahanian opinion was important in the development of the battleships arms races, and equally important in the agreement of the Powers to limit battleship numbers in the interwar era.

The &quot;fleet in being&quot; suggested battleships could simply by their existence tie down superior enemy resources. This in turn was believed to be able to tip the balance of a conflict even without a battle. This suggested even for inferior naval powers a battleship fleet could have important strategic impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/ops/fleet-in-being.htm |title=&quot;Fleet In Being&quot;, Globalsecurity.org.

===Tactics===
While the role of battleships in both World Wars reflected Mahanian doctrine, the details of battleship deployment were more complex. Unlike the [[ship of the line]], the battleships of the late 19th and early 20th centuries had significant vulnerability to torpedoes and mines, weapons which could be used by relatively small and inexpensive craft. The [[Jeune École]] school of thought of the 1870s and 1880s recommended the placing of [[torpedo boat]]s alongside battleships; the boats would hide behind the battleships until gun-smoke obscured visibility enough for them to dart out and fire their torpedoes.&lt;ref name = &quot;Sondhaus&quot; /&gt; While this concept was vitiated by the development of smokeless propellant, the threat from more capable torpedo craft (later including submarines) remained. By the 1890s the Royal Navy had developed the first [[destroyer]]s, small ships designed to intercept and drive off any attacking torpedo boats. During the First World War and subsequently, battleships were rarely deployed without a protective screen of destroyers.

Battleship doctrine emphasised the concentration of the battlegroup. In order for this concentrated force to be able to bring its power to bear on a reluctant opponent (or to avoid an encounter with a stronger enemy fleet), battlefleets needed some means of locating enemy ships beyond horizon range. This was provided by scouting forces; at various stages [[battlecruisers]], [[cruisers]], destroyers, [[airship]]s, submarines and aircraft were all used. (With the development of radio, [[direction finding]] and [[traffic analysis]] would come into play, as well, so even shore stations, broadly speaking, joined the battlegroup.&lt;ref&gt;It could presage an enemy sortie, or locate an enemy over the horizon. Beesly, Patrick. ''Room 40'' (London : Hamish Hamilton)&lt;/ref&gt;) So for most of their history, battleships operated surrounded by squadrons of destroyers and cruisers. The North Sea campaign of the First World War illustrates how, despite this support, the threat of mine and torpedo attack, and the failure to integrate or appreciate the capabilities of new techniques,&lt;ref&gt;Beesly.&lt;/ref&gt; seriously inhibited the operations of the Royal Navy Grand Fleet, the greatest battleship fleet of its time.

===Strategic and diplomatic impact===
The presence of battleships had a great psychological and diplomatic impact. Similar to possessing [[nuclear weapon]]s today, the ownership of battleships served to enhance a nation's force projection.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sondhaus&quot;/&gt;

Even during the [[Cold War]], the psychological impact of a battleship was significant. In 1946, USS ''Missouri'' was dispatched to deliver the remains of the ambassador from Turkey, and her presence in Turkish and [[Greece|Greek]] waters staved off a possible Soviet thrust into the [[Balkans|Balkan]] region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/m12/missouri-iv.htm|title= USS Missouri|accessdate=2007-03-18 |publisher= Naval Historical Center|work= Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1983, when [[Druze]] militia in [[Lebanon]]'s Shouf Mountains fired upon U.S. Marine peacekeepers, the arrival of USS ''New Jersey'' stopped the firing. Gunfire from ''New Jersey'' later killed militia leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chinfo.navy.mil/navpalib/ships/battleships/newjersey/bb62-nj.html |title= USS New Jersey|accessdate=2007-03-18 |work= Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070203052502/http://www.chinfo.navy.mil/navpalib/ships/battleships/newjersey/bb62-nj.html| archivedate = February 3, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Value for money===
Battleships were the largest and most complex, and hence the most expensive warships of their time; as a result, the value of investment in battleships has always been contested. As the French politician Etienne Lamy wrote in 1879, &quot;The construction of battleships is so costly, their effectiveness so uncertain and of such short duration, that the enterprise of creating an armored fleet seems to leave fruitless the perseverance of a people&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0JIW/is_4_58/ai_n15927771/pg_5 Net-Centric before its time: The Jeune École and Its Lessons for Today] Erik J. Dahl U.S. Naval War College Review, Autumn 2005, Vol. 58, No. 4&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Jeune École]]'' school of thought of the 1870s and 1880s sought alternatives to the crippling expense and debatable utility of a conventional battlefleet. It proposed what would nowadays be termed a [[sea denial]] strategy, based on fast, long-ranged cruisers for commerce raiding and torpedo boat flotillas to attack enemy ships attempting to blockade French ports. The ideas of the ''Jeune Ecole'' were ahead of their time; it was not until the 20th century that efficient mines, torpedoes, submarines, and aircraft were available that allowed similar ideas to be effectively implemented.&lt;ref&gt;Dahl, ''op cit.''&lt;/ref&gt;

The determination of powers such as the [[German Empire]] to build battlefleets with which to confront much stronger rivals has been criticised by historians, who emphasise the futility of investment in a battlefleet which has no chance of matching its opponent in an actual battle.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sondhaus&quot;/&gt; According to this view, attempts by a weaker navy to compete head-to-head with a stronger one in battleship construction simply wasted resources which could have been better invested in attacking the enemy's points of weakness. In Germany's case, the British dependence on massive imports of food and raw materials proved to be a near-fatal weakness, once Germany had accepted the political risk of [[unrestricted submarine warfare]] against commercial shipping. Although the U-boat offensive in 1917–18 was ultimately defeated, it was successful in causing huge material loss and forcing the Allies to divert vast resources into [[anti-submarine warfare]]. This success, though not ultimately decisive, was nevertheless in sharp contrast to the inability of the German battlefleet to challenge the supremacy of Britain's far stronger fleet.

[[File:Heimdall an der Himmelsbrücke.jpg|thumb|The god [[Heimdallr]] stands before the rainbow bridge while blowing a horn (1905) by [[Emil Doepler]].]]
In [[Norse mythology]], '''Bifröst''' or '''Bilröst''' is a burning [[rainbow]] bridge that reaches between [[Midgard]] (the world) and [[Asgard]], the realm of the gods. The bridge is attested as ''Bilröst'' in the ''[[Poetic Edda]]''; compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, and as ''Bifröst'' in  the ''[[Prose Edda]]''; written in the 13th century by [[Snorri Sturluson]], and in the poetry of [[skald]]s. Both the ''Poetic Edda'' and the ''Prose Edda'' alternately refer to the bridge as '''Asbrú''' ([[Old Norse]] &quot;[[Æsir]]'s bridge&quot;).&lt;ref name=SIMEK19&gt;Simek (2007:19).&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to the ''Prose Edda'', the bridge ends in heaven at [[Himinbjörg]], the residence of the god [[Heimdallr]], who guards it from the [[Jötunn|jötnar]]. The bridge's destruction at [[Ragnarök]] by the forces of [[Múspellsheimr|Muspell]] is foretold. Scholars have  proposed that the bridge may have originally represented the [[Milky Way]] and have noted parallels between the bridge and another bridge in Norse mythology, [[Gjallarbrú]].

==Etymology==
Scholar [[Andy Orchard]] posits that ''Bifröst'' may mean &quot;shimmering path.&quot; He notes that the first element of ''Bilröst''—''bil'' (meaning &quot;a moment&quot;)—&quot;suggests the fleeting nature of the rainbow,&quot; which he connects to the first element of ''Bifröst''—the [[Old Norse]] verb ''bifa'' (meaning &quot;to shimmer&quot; or &quot;to shake&quot;)—noting that the element provokes notions of the &quot;lustrous sheen&quot; of the bridge.&lt;ref name=ORCHARD19&gt;Orchard (1997:19).&lt;/ref&gt; Austrian Germanist [[Rudolf Simek]] says that ''Bifröst'' either means &quot;the swaying road to heaven&quot; (also citing ''bifa'') or, if ''Bilröst'' is the original form of the two (which Simek says is likely), &quot;the fleetingly glimpsed rainbow&quot; (possibly connected to ''[[Hjuki and Bil|bil]]'', perhaps meaning &quot;moment, weak point&quot;).&lt;ref name=SIMEK36-37&gt;Simek (2007:36-37).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attestations==
Two poems in the ''Poetic Edda'' and two books in the ''Prose Edda'' provide information about the bridge:

===''Poetic Edda''===
[[File:Thor wades while the æsir ride by Frølich.jpg|thumb|Thor wades through rivers while the rest of the æsir ride across Bifröst (1895) by [[Lorenz Frølich]].]]
In the ''Poetic Edda'', the bridge is mentioned in the poems ''[[Grímnismál]]'' and ''[[Fáfnismál]]'', where it is referred to as ''Bilröst''. In one of two stanzas in the poem ''[[Grímnismál]]'' that mentions the bridge,  [[List of names of Odin|Grímnir]] (the god [[Odin]] in disguise) provides the young [[Agnarr Geirröðsson|Agnarr]] with cosmological knowledge, including that Bilröst is the best of bridges.&lt;ref name=LARRINGTON44&gt;Larrington (1999:44).&lt;/ref&gt; Later in ''Grímnismál'', Grímnir notes that Asbrú &quot;burns all with flames&quot; and that, every day, the god [[Thor]] wades through the waters of [[Körmt and Örmt]] and the two [[Kerlaugar]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
{|
|
:&lt;small&gt;[[Benjamin Thorpe]] translation:&lt;/small&gt;
:Körmt and Ormt, and the Kerlaugs twain:
:these Thor must wade
:each day, when he to council goes
:at [[Yggdrasil]]'s [[ash tree|ash]];
:for as the As-bridge is all on fire,
:the holy waters boil.&lt;ref name=THORPE22&gt;Thorpe (1907:22).&lt;/ref&gt;
|
:&lt;small&gt;[[Henry Adams Bellows]] translation:&lt;/small&gt;
:Kormt and Ormt and the Kerlaugs twain
:Shall Thor each day wade through,
:(When dooms to give he forth shall go
:To the ash-tree Yggdrasil;)
:For heaven's bridge burns all in flame,
:And the sacred waters seethe.&lt;ref name=BELLOWS96&gt;Bellows (1923:96).&lt;/ref&gt;
|
|}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In ''Fáfnismál'', the dying [[wyrm]] [[Fafnir]] tells the hero [[Sigurd]] that, during the events of Ragnarok, bearing spears, gods will meet at [[Óskópnir]]. From there, the gods will cross Bilröst, which will break apart as they cross over it, causing their horses to dredge through an immense river.&lt;ref name=LARRINGTON160&gt;Larrington (1999:160).&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Prose Edda''===
[[File:Kampf der untergehenden Götter by F. W. Heine.jpg|thumb|Bifröst appears in the background as the gods do battle in ''Battle of the Doomed Gods'' (1882) by [[Friedrich Wilhelm Heine]].]]
[[File:The twilight of the gods by Willy Pogany.png|thumb|right|Bifröst is shattered in ''The twilight of the gods'' (1920) by [[Willy Pogany]].]]
The bridge is mentioned in the ''Prose Edda'' books ''[[Gylfaginning]]'' and ''[[Skáldskaparmál]]'', where it is referred to as ''Bifröst''. In chapter 13 of ''Gylfaginning'', [[Gangleri]] (King [[Gylfi]] in disguise) asks the enthroned figure of [[High, Just-As-High, and Third|High]] what way exists between heaven and earth. Laughing, High replies that the question isn't an intelligent one, and goes on to explain that the gods built a bridge from heaven and earth. He increduously asks Gangleri if he has not heard the story before. High says that Gangleri must have seen it, and notes that Gangleri may call it a [[rainbow]]. High says that the bridge consists of three colors, has great strength, &quot;and is built with art and skill to a greater extent than other constructions.&quot;&lt;ref name=FAULKES15&gt;Faulkes (1995:15).&lt;/ref&gt;

High notes that, although the bridge is strong, it will break when &quot;[[Múspellsheimr|Muspell]]'s lads&quot; attempt to cross it, and their horses will have to make due with swimming over &quot;great rivers.&quot; Gangleri says that it doesn't seem that the gods &quot;built the bridge in good faith if it is liable to break, considering that they can do as they please.&quot; High responds that the gods do not deserve blame for the breaking of the bridge, for &quot;there is nothing in this world that will be secure when Muspell's sons attack.&quot;&lt;ref name=FAULKES15/&gt;

In chapter 15 of ''Gylfaginning'', [[High, Just-As-High, and Third|Just-As-High]] says that Bifröst is also called ''Asbrú'', and that every day the gods ride [[Horses of the Æsir|their horses]] across it (with the exception of Thor, who instead wades through the boiling waters of the rivers [[Körmt and Örmt]]) to reach [[Urðarbrunnr]], a holy well where the gods have their court. As a reference, Just-As-High quotes the second of the two stanzas in ''Grímnismál'' that mention the bridge (see above). Gangleri asks if fire burns over Bifröst. High says that the red in the bridge is burning fire, and, without it, the frost jotnar and mountain jotnar would &quot;go up into heaven&quot; if anyone who wanted could cross Bifröst. High adds that, in heaven, &quot;there are many beautiful places&quot; and that &quot;everywhere there has divine protection around it.&quot;&lt;ref name=FAULKES17-18&gt;Faulkes (1995:17—18).&lt;/ref&gt;

In chapter 17, High tells Gangleri that the location of [[Himinbjörg]] &quot;stands at the edge of heaven where Bifrost reaches heaven.&quot;&lt;ref name=FAULKES20&gt;Faulkes (1995:20).&lt;/ref&gt; While describing the god [[Heimdallr]] in chapter 27, High says that Heimdallr lives in Himinbjörg by Bifröst, and guards the bridge from mountain jotnar while sitting at the edge of heaven.&lt;ref name=FAULKES25&gt;Faulkes (1995:25).&lt;/ref&gt; In chapter chapter 34, High quotes the first of the two ''Grímnismál'' stanzas that mention the bridge.&lt;ref name=FAULKES34&gt;Faulkes (1995:34).&lt;/ref&gt; In chapter 51, High foretells the events of [[Ragnarök]]. High says that, during Ragnarök, the sky will split open, and from the split will ride forth the &quot;sons of [[Múspellsheimr|Muspell]]&quot;. When the &quot;sons of Muspell&quot; ride over Bifröst it will break, &quot;as was said above.&quot;&lt;ref name=FAULKES53&gt;Faulkes (1995:53).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''Prose Edda'' book ''[[Skáldskaparmál]]'', the bridge receives a single mention. In chapter 16, a work by the 10th century [[skald]] [[Úlfr Uggason]] is provided, where Bifröst is referred to as &quot;the powers' way.&quot;&lt;ref name=FAULKES77&gt;Faulkes (1995:77).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories==

In his translation of the ''Prose Edda'', [[Henry Adams Bellows]] comments that the ''Grímnismál'' stanza mentioning Thor and the bridge stanza may mean that &quot;Thor has to go on foot in the last days of the destruction, when the bridge is burning. Another interpretation, however, is that when Thor leaves the heavens (i.e., when a thunder-storm is over) the rainbow-bridge becomes hot in the sun.&quot;&lt;ref name=BELLOWS96/&gt;

[[John Lindow]] points to a parallel between Bifröst, which he notes is &quot;a bridge between earth and heaven, or earth and the world of the gods&quot;, and the bridge [[Gjallarbrú]], &quot;a bridge between earth and the underworld, or earth and the world of the dead.&quot;&lt;ref name=LINDOW81&gt;Lindow (2002:81).&lt;/ref&gt; Several scholars have proposed that Bifröst may represent the [[Milky Way]].&lt;ref name=MILKYWAY&gt;Lindow (2002:81) and Simek (2007:36).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Battlecruisers''' (also rendered as '''battle cruiser''' in some sources) were large [[capital ships]] built in the first half of the 20th century. They were developed in the first decade of the century as the successor to the [[armoured cruiser]], but their evolution was more closely linked to that of the [[dreadnought]] [[battleship]]. They were similar in size and cost to a [[battleship]], but while they typically used the same large-calibre main armament as a battleship, battlecruisers sacrificed armour protection in exchange for speed. 

Throughout the [[World War I|First World War]], the battlecruiser was principally used to provide a fast and hard-hitting addition to a battleship fleet. Battlecruisers formed part of the navies of Britain, [[German Imperial Navy|Germany]] and [[Imperial Japanese Navy|Japan]] in World War I and took part in several raids and skirmishes as well as the [[Battle of Jutland]].&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, ''Rise and Fall of British Naval Mastery'', p.250&amp;ndash;1&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the war, there were very few differences between the design of a battlecruiser and that of a [[fast battleship]]. Britain, Japan and the [[United States]] all designed battlecruisers after the end of World War I which were as heavily armed as a battleship, though faster and still not as heavily armoured. The [[Washington Naval Treaty]], which limited capital ship construction from 1922 onwards, treated battleships and battlecruisers identically, and the new generation of battlecruisers planned was scrapped under the terms of the treaty.

From the 1930s, only the Royal Navy continued to use 'battlecruiser' as a classification for warships, for the WWI-era capital ships that remained in the fleet.&lt;ref&gt;While Japan's battlecruisers continued in service, they were significantly reconstructed and re-rated as battleships.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the fast, light capital ships developed by Germany and France of the [[Scharnhorst class battleship|''Scharnhorst'']] and [[Dunkerque class battleship|''Dunkerque'']] classes are often referred to as battlecruisers,&lt;ref&gt;Miller, ''Illustrated Directory of Warships'', p.179&amp;ndash;187&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Osborne, 'Cruisers and Battle Cruisers: An illustrated history of their impact'', p.115&amp;ndash;116&lt;/ref&gt; as they were as well armoured but smaller and carried a lighter calibre of armament compared to follow-up designs which were considered fast battleships.

The Second World War saw battlecruisers in action again, mostly consisting of modernized WWI ships as well as the fast battleships built in the 1930s. There was also renewed interest in large &quot;cruiser killer&quot; type warships, but few ever began construction (the exception being the American {{Sclass|Alaska|cruiser|4}}), as construction of capital ships was curtailed in favor of more needed convoy escorts, aircraft carriers, and cargo ships. In the post–World War II era, only the Soviet {{Sclass|Kirov|battlecruiser|4}} have been described as battlecruisers.

==First battlecruisers==
[[Image:HMS Invincible (1907) British Battleship.jpg|thumb|[[HMS Invincible (1908)|HMS ''Invincible'']], Britain's first battlecruiser]]

The battlecruiser was a dramatic evolution of the [[armoured cruiser]] and 'second-class [[battleship]]' designs of the 1890s, principally due to the British [[John Fisher, 1st Baron Fisher|Admiral Jackie Fisher]].&lt;ref&gt;Sondhaus, 199. Roberts, 13&lt;/ref&gt; At the turn of the century, the modern armoured cruiser was a fast and powerful vessel which was capable of threatening trade routes worldwide, or of working closely with a battleship fleet.&lt;ref&gt;Breyer, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; The Royal Navy, and Fisher in particular, was concerned with the damage armoured cruisers (particularly those of the French Navy) might inflict on British trade worldwide in the event of war.&lt;ref&gt;Breyer, p. 47; Mackay, p. 270. Mackay quotes Fisher: &quot;The fact has been overlooked that no number of unprotected or unarmoured or smaller type of Cruiser can cope successfully with even one thoroughly powerful first-class armoured cruiser. An infinite number of ants would not be equal to one armadillo! The armadillo would eat them up one after another wholesale!&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Fisher envisaged British armoured cruisers becoming faster and more heavily armed to deal with this threat. He was also very fond of the &quot;second-class battleship&quot; [[HMS Renown (1895)|HMS ''Renown'']], a lighter, faster battleship.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, p.15. Macaky, p.212-3&lt;/ref&gt; As early as 1901, there is confusion in Fisher's writing about whether he saw the battleship or the cruiser as the model for future developments.

In the period 1902–1904 the mainstream of British naval thinking was clearly in favour of heavily armoured battleships, rather than the fast ships which Fisher favoured. A shift away from the mixed-calibre armament of the 1890s [[pre-dreadnought]] to an &quot;all-big-gun&quot; design was already being considered, and preliminary designs circulated for battleships with all 12-inch or all 10-inch guns and armoured cruisers with all 9.2-inch guns.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, 16-17&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-1904, after Fisher's appointment as [[First Sea Lord]], the decision was taken to use 12-inch guns for the next generation of battleships, because of their superior performance at long range. The armament of the next armoured cruiser was much more controversial. The size and cost of the next generation of armoured cruisers meant that it was very desirable that they should be able to play a role in a battleship action, and this meant 12-inch guns.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, 17-18; Mackay, 324-5&lt;/ref&gt; This was the same logic which had led the Japanese to arm their latest cruisers with four 12-inch guns as their main armament.&lt;ref&gt;Breyer, p.48&lt;/ref&gt; It is also quite possible that Fisher pushed for the cruiser to have the same armament as the battleship because he held out hope that the cruiser design would be the replacement for the battleship. The decision to give the next generation of armoured cruisers an 'all-big-gun' armament was the crucial moment in the development of the battlecruiser. If the ships had been armed with only 10-inch or 9.2-inch guns, they would merely have been better armoured cruisers.&lt;ref name = &quot;oyaprk&quot;&gt;Roberts, p.18&lt;/ref&gt;

The radical changes to shipbuilding policy which Fisher was making across the board meant that he appointed a Committee on Designs in December 1904. While the stated purpose of the Committee was to investigate and report on the requirements of future ships, the key decisions had already been taken by Fisher and his associates.&lt;ref name = &quot;jssyvc&quot;&gt;Roberts, p.19&lt;/ref&gt; The terms of reference for the Committee were for a battleship capable of 21 knots with 12-inch guns and no intermediate calibres, capable of operating from existing docks;&lt;ref&gt;Breyer, p.115&lt;/ref&gt; and a cruiser capable of 25.5 knots, also with 12-inch guns and no intermediate armament, armoured like [[HMS Minotaur (1906)|HMS ''Minotaur'']], the most recent armoured cruiser, and also capable of working from the existing docks.&lt;ref name = &quot;jssyvc&quot;/&gt; The battleship became the revolutionary battleship [[HMS Dreadnought|HMS ''Dreadnought'']], and the cruiser became the three ships of the [[Invincible class battlecruiser|''Invincible'']] class.

The construction of the new class was begun in 1906 and completed in 1908, delayed perhaps to allow their designs to learn from any problems with ''Dreadnought''.&lt;ref&gt;Breyer, 115; Roberts, 24-5&lt;/ref&gt; The ships fulfilled the design requirement quite closely. The ''Invincibles'' had a displacement similar to that of the ''Dreadnought'' but twice the power to give a speed of {{convert|25|kn|km/h|0}}. They had eight [[BL 12 inch Mk X naval gun|{{convert|12|in|mm|0|sing=on}} Mk X guns]], compared to ten on ''Dreadnought''. There was armour 6 or 7&amp;nbsp;inches (150 to 180&amp;nbsp;mm) thick along the side of the hull and over the gunhouses, whereas ''Dreadnought'''s armour was 11&amp;nbsp;inches (280 to 300&amp;nbsp;mm) at its thickest.&lt;ref&gt;Breyer, 114-7&lt;/ref&gt; The class had a very marked increase in speed, displacement and firepower compared to the most recent armoured cruisers, but no more armour.

The ''Invincibles'' were to have the same role as the armoured cruisers they succeeded, but the new ships were expected to be more effective all-round. Specifically their roles were:
*Heavy Reconnaissance. Because of their power, the ''Invincibles'' could sweep away the screen of enemy cruisers to close with and observe an enemy battlefleet, before using their superior speed to retire.
*Close support for the battlefleet. They could be stationed at the ends of the battle line to stop enemy cruisers harassing the battleships, and to harass the enemy's battleships if they were busy fighting battleships. Also, the ''Invincible''s could operate as the fast wing of the battlefleet and try to outmanouevre the enemy.
*Pursuit. If an enemy fleet ran, then the ''Invincible''s would use their speed to pursue, and their guns to damage or slow enemy ships.
*Commerce protection. The new ships would hunt down enemy cruisers and commerce raiders.&lt;ref name = &quot;oyaprk&quot;/&gt;

Confusion about how to refer to these new battleship-size armoured cruisers set in almost immediately. Even in late 1905, before work was begun on the ''Invincibles'', a Royal Navy memorandum refers to &quot;large armoured ships&quot; meaning both battleships and large cruisers. In October 1906, the Admiralty began to classify all post-Dreadnought battleships and armoured cruisers as &quot;[[capital ships]]&quot;, while Fisher used the term &quot;dreadnought&quot; to refer either to his new battleships or the battleships and armoured cruisers together.&lt;ref&gt;Mackay, p. 325–26&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the ''Invincible'' class themselves were referred to as &quot;cruiser-battleship&quot;, &quot;dreadnought cruiser&quot;; the term &quot;battlecruiser&quot; was first used by Fisher in 1908. Finally, on 24 November 1911, Admiralty Weekly Order No. 351 laid down the decision that &quot;All cruisers of the ''Invincible'' and later type are, for the future, to be described and classified as battlecruisers in order to distinguish them from armoured cruisers of the older type.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Admiralty Weekly Order No.351, ([http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/catalogue/displaycataloguedetails.asp?CATLN=6&amp;CATID=3452787 ADM 182/2]).  Quoted in Roberts, p.24-5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Battlecruisers in the Dreadnought arms race==
[[Image:HMS Queen Mary.jpg|left|thumb|''[[HMS Queen Mary]]'', the third ''Lion'' Class Battlecruiser]]

In the period from the launching of the ''Invincibles'' to just after the outbreak of the First World War, the battlecruiser played a junior role in the developing dreadnought arms race. The battlecruiser was never wholeheartedly adopted as the key weapon in British imperial defence, as Fisher had presumably desired.

Britain's strategic circumstances had changed markedly between the conception of the battlecruiser and the commissioning of the first ships. While the prospective enemy for Britain had previously been a Franco-Russian alliance with many armoured cruisers, it was now clearly Germany. Diplomatically, Britain had entered the [[Entente cordiale]] in 1904 and the [[Anglo-Russian Entente]]. Furthermore neither France nor Russia posed a particular naval threat; the Russian navy had largely been sunk or captured in the [[Russo-Japanese War]] of 1904-5, while the French were in no hurry to adopt the new [[dreadnought|dreadnought battleship]] technology.&lt;ref&gt;Sondhaus, p.200-1&lt;/ref&gt; Britain also boasted very cordial relations with two of the significant new naval powers; Japan (bolstered by the [[Anglo-Japanese Alliance]], signed in 1902 and renewed in 1905), and the USA.

These changed strategic circumstances, and the great success of the ''Dreadnought'', ensured that she rather than the ''Invincible'' became the new model capital ship. Nevertheless, battlecruiser construction played a major part in the renewed naval arms-race sparked by the ''Dreadnought''.

For the first few years after their completion, the ''Invincible''s entirely fulfilled Fisher's vision of being able to sink any ship fast enough to catch them, and run from any ship capable of sinking them. An ''Invincible'' would also in many circumstances, be able to take on an enemy [[pre-dreadnought battleship]]. The ''Invincibles'' were so far ahead of any enemy armoured cruiser that it was difficult to justify building more or bigger cruisers.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, p.25; Mackay p.324-5&lt;/ref&gt; This lead was extended by the surprise both ''Dreadnought'' and ''Invincible'' produced, which prompted most other navies to delay their building programmes while radically revising their designs. This was particularly true for cruisers, because the details of the ''Invincible'' class were kept secret for longer; this meant that the next German armoured cruiser, [[SMS Blücher|''Blücher'']] was armed with only 8.2-inch guns, and was obsolete before she was even launched.

The Royal Navy's early superiority in capital ships led to the rejection of a design of 1905-6 which would essentially have fused the battlecruiser and battleship concepts. The 'X4' design combined the full armour and armament of ''Dreadnought'' with the 25-knot speed of ''Invincible''. The additional cost could not be justified given the existing British lead and the new Liberal government's need for economy; the slower and cheaper [[HMS Bellerophon (1907)|''Bellerophon'']], a relatively close copy of ''Dreadnought'', was adopted instead.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, 26&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1911 Germany had built battlecruisers of her own, and the superiority of the British ships could no longer be assured. [[SMS Von der Tann|''Von der Tann'']], begun in 1908 and completed in 1910, carried eight 11.1-inch guns but with 11.1-inch (280&amp;nbsp;mm) armour was far better protected than the ''Invincibles''. The two [[Moltke class battlecruiser|''Moltke''s]] were quite similar but carried ten 11.1-inch guns of an improved design.&lt;ref&gt;Breyer, p.269-272&lt;/ref&gt; The German Navy did not share Fisher's view of what a battlecruiser should be; it was entitled to build armoured cruisers under the terms of the Navy Laws, and used this authority to match or better the British battlecruisers.&lt;ref&gt;Sondhaus, p.202-3&lt;/ref&gt;

The next British battlecruisers were three of the [[Indefatigable class battlecruiser|''Indefatigable'']] class. These ships were slightly improved ''Invincible''s, which corrected some flaws in the earlier ships but were built to fundamentally the same specification. The British were hampered on this occasion by the secrecy surrounding German battlecruiser construction and particularly about the heavy armour of ''Von der Tann''. Political pressure to reduce costs also played a role in the selection of the ''Indefatigable'' design,&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, p.28-9&lt;/ref&gt; and this class is widely seen as a mistake.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, p.57&lt;/ref&gt;

The next generation of British battlecruisers were markedly more powerful. By 1909-10 the political climate had changed; the desire for cost-cutting was now outweighed by a sense of national crisis about rivalry with Germany. A brief political crisis and a naval panic resulted in the approval of a total of eight capital ships in 1909-10.&lt;ref&gt;Sondhaus, p.203&lt;/ref&gt; Fisher pressed for all of them to be battlecruisers,&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, p.32; Brown, p.58&lt;/ref&gt; but was unable to force his way, and had to settle for six battleships as well as two battlecruisers of the [[Lion class battlecruiser|''Lion'' class]]. These carried eight [[BL 13.5 inch Mk V naval gun|13.5-inch guns]]; the standard armament of the British &quot;super-dreadnought&quot; battleships of the same period was ten 13.5-inch. Speed increased, to 27 knots. ''Lion'' also carried better armour than previous British battlecruisers, with 9&amp;nbsp;inches on the armour belt and barbettes; nevertheless, protection was not as good as in German designs. The two ''Lion''s were followed by the very similar [[HMS Queen Mary|''Queen Mary'']] &lt;ref&gt;Roberts, p. 31-33&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to the British focus on increasing speed and firepower, Germany further improved the armour and staying power of their next battlecruiser. [[SMS Seydlitz|''Seydlitz'']], designed in 1909 and finished in 1913, was a modified ''Moltke''; speed increased by one knot to 26.5 knots, while armour was up to 12&amp;nbsp;inches thick, equivalent for the [[Helgoland class battleship|''Helgoland'']] class battleships of just one or two years earlier. ''Seydlitz'' was Germany's last battlecruiser to be completed before World War I.&lt;ref&gt;Breyer, p. 267, 272&lt;/ref&gt;

The next step in the battlecruiser design came from Japan. The [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] had been planning the [[Kongō class battlecruiser|''Kongō'' class]] ships from 1909. The Japanese navy was determined that, since the Japanese economy could support relatively few ships, each ship would be more powerful than its likely competitors. Initially the class was planned with the ''Invincible''s as the benchmark. On learning of the British plans for ''Lion'', and the likelihood that new [[U.S. Navy]] battleships would be armed with 14-inch guns, the Japanese decided to radically revise their plans and go one better. A new plan was drawn up, carrying eight 14-inch guns, and capable of 27.5 knots, thus marginally having the edge over the British ''Lion''s in speed and firepower. The heavy guns were also better-positioned, being [[superfire|superfiring]] both fore and aft with no turret amidships. The armour scheme was also marginally improved over the ''Lion''s with 9&amp;nbsp;inches of armour on the turrets and 8&amp;nbsp;inches on the barbettes. The first ship in the class was built in Britain, and a further three constructed in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Evans and Peattie, p.161-3&lt;/ref&gt; The Japanese also re-classified their strong armoured cruisers of [[Tsukuba class cruiser|''Tsukuba'']] and [[Ibuki class battlecruiser|''Ibuki'']] classes, carrying four 12-inch guns, as battlecruisers, nonetheless they had weaker armament and were slower.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Gardiner (editor): ''Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships: 1906-1921''. Annapolis: US Naval Institute Press, 1985, p. 233. ISBN 0-87021-907-3&lt;/ref&gt;

The next British battlecruiser, [[HMS Tiger (1913)|''Tiger'']], was broadly on the model of ''Lion'' but also influenced by the design of the Japanese ships.&lt;ref&gt;Breyer, p.135&lt;/ref&gt; She retained the eight 13.5-inch guns of her predecessors, though these were positioned for better fields of fire. She was faster (making 29 knots on trials), and carried a heavier secondary armament. ''Tiger'' was also more heavily armoured on the whole; while the maximum thickness of armour was the same at 9&amp;nbsp;inches, the height of the main armour belt was increased.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, p. 37-8&lt;/ref&gt;

1912 saw work begin on three more German battlecruisers of the [[Derfflinger class battlecruiser|''Derfflinger'' class]], the first German battlecruisers to mount 12-inch guns. These excellent ships, like the ''Tiger'' and the ''Kongō'', had their guns arranged in superfiring turrets for greater efficiency. Their armour and speed was similar to the previous ''Seydlitz'' class.&lt;ref&gt;Breyer, p.277-8&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1913, the Russian Empire also began the construction of the four-ship [[Borodino class battlecruiser|''Borodino'' class]], which were designed for service in the [[Baltic Sea]]. These ships were designed to carry twelve 14-inch guns, with armour up to 12&amp;nbsp;inches thick, and a speed of 26.6 knots. The heavy armour and relatively slow speed of these ships makes them more similar to German designs than to British ships; construction of the ''Borodino''s was halted by the First World War and all were scrapped during the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]].&lt;ref name = &quot;jndjmt&quot;&gt;Breyer, p.399&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1914, only Britain, Germany and Japan had battlecruisers, with Russia building some. On several occasions, it had already been possible to point to moments where the concepts of battlecruiser and battleship might be seen in the same vessel. This was true of the 1906 'X4' design,&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, p.26&lt;/ref&gt; and the Russian ''Borodino''s&lt;ref name = &quot;jndjmt&quot;/&gt; and arguably the entire German Battlecruiser program. It was even more true of the most recent British battleship design. The [[Queen Elizabeth class battleship|''Queen Elizabeth'']] class was designed to make 25 knots, as much as the first battlecruisers had achieved, while carrying eight 15-inch guns and armour up to 15&amp;nbsp;inches thick.&lt;ref&gt;Breyer, p.140-1&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Queen Elizabeths'' were the first true [[fast battleship]]s, and could have brought the end of the development of the battlecruiser as an independent line. It was principally due to the influence of Jacky Fisher that the battlecruiser continued.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, p.38-9&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War I==
The First World War saw British and German battlecruisers used in several theatres. Battlecruisers formed part of the dreadnought fleets which faced each other down in the North Sea, taking part in several raids and skirmishes as well as the Battle of Jutland. Battlecruisers also played an important role at the start of the War as the British fleet hunted down German commerce raiders, for instance at the [[Battle of the Falkland Islands]], and also took part in the Mediterranean campaign.

===Construction===
For most of the combatants, capital ship construction was very limited during the War. Germany finished the ''Derfflinger'' class and began work on the [[Mackensen class battlecruiser|''Mackensen'' class]]. The ''Mackensen''s were a development of the ''Derfflinger'' class, with 13.8-inch guns and a broadly similar armour scheme, designed for 28 knots.&lt;ref&gt;Breyer, p.283-4&lt;/ref&gt;

In Britain, Jackie Fisher returned to the office of First Sea Lord in October 1914. His enthusiasm for big, fast ships was unabated, and he set design staff to producing a design for a battlecruiser with 15-inch guns. Because Fisher expected the next German battlecruiser to steam at 28 knots, he required the new British design to be capable of 32 knots. He planned to convert two [[Revenge class battleship|''Royal Sovereign'' class battleships]], which had been approved but not yet laid down. Fisher finally received approval for this project on 28 December 1914 and they became the [[Renown class battlecruiser|''Renown'' class]]. With six [[BL 15 inch Mk I naval gun|15-inch guns]] but only 6-inch armour they were a further step forward from ''Tiger'' in firepower and speed but returned to the level of protection of the first British battlecruisers.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, p.46-7&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, Fisher resorted to subterfuge to obtain another three fast, lightly armoured ships which could make use of the several spare 15-inch gun turrets left over from battleship construction. These ships were essentially light battlecruisers, and Fisher can occasionally be found referring to them as such, but were officially classified as &quot;large light cruisers&quot;. This unusual designation was required because construction of new capital ships had been placed on hold, while there were no limits on [[light cruiser]] construction. They became [[Courageous class battlecruiser|''Courageous'']] and her sisters ''[[HMS Glorious|Glorious]]'' and ''[[HMS Furious (47)|Furious]]'', and there was a bizarre imbalance between their main guns of 15&amp;nbsp;inches (or 18&amp;nbsp;inches in 'Furious') and their armour, which at 3&amp;nbsp;inches thickness was on the scale of a light cruiser. The design was generally regarded as a bizarre failure (nicknamed in the Fleet ''Outrageous'', ''Uproarious'' and ''Spurious''), though the later conversion of the ships to aircraft carriers was very successful.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, p.50-2 Brown, P.97-8&lt;/ref&gt; Fisher also speculated about a new mammoth but lightly built battlecruiser which would carry 20-inch guns, which he termed [[HMS Incomparable]]; this never got beyond the concept stage.

It is often held that the ''Renown'' and ''Courageous'' classes were designed for Fisher's plan to land troops (possibly Russian) on the German Baltic coast. Specifically, they were designed with a shallow draught, which might be important in the shallow Baltic. This is not clear-cut evidence that the ships were designed for the Baltic: it was considered that earlier ships had too much draught and not enough [[Freeboard (nautical)|freeboard]] under operational conditions. Roberts argues that the focus on the Baltic was probably unimportant at the time the ships were designed, but was inflated later, after the disastrous [[Dardanelles Campaign]].&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, p.51&lt;/ref&gt;

The final British battlecruiser design of the war was the [[Admiral class battlecruiser|''Admiral'' class]], which was born from a requirement for an improved version of the ''Queen Elizabeth'' battleship. The project began at the end of 1915, after Fisher's final departure from the Admiralty. While initially envisaged as a battleship, senior sea officers felt that Britain had enough battleships, but that new battlecruisers might be required to combat German ships being built (the British overestimated German progress on the ''Mackensen'' class as well as their likely capabilities). A battlecruiser design with eight 15-inch guns, 8&amp;nbsp;inches of armour and capable of 32 knots was decided on. The experience of battlecruisers at the Battle of Jutland meant that the design was radically revised and transformed again into a fast battleship concept with armour up to 12&amp;nbsp;inches thick but still capable of 31.5 knots. The first ship in the class, [[HMS Hood (51)|''Hood'']], went ahead according to this design. The plans for her three sisters, on which little work had been done, were revised once more later in 1916 and in 1917 to improve protection.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, p.58-61&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Admiral'' class would have been the only British ships capable of taking on the German ''Mackensen'' type; German shipbuilding was drastically slowed by the war, and while two ''Mackensen''s were launched, none were ever completed. Work on the three additional ''Admiral''s was suspended in March 1917 to enable more escorts and merchant ships to be built to deal with the new threat from U-boats to trade. They were finally cancelled in February 1919.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, p.60-1&lt;/ref&gt;

===Operations===
The German battlecruiser [[SMS Goeben|''Goeben'']] was perhaps the ship which made the most impact early in the War. Stationed in the Mediterranean, she and her escorting cruiser [[Pursuit of Goeben and Breslau|evaded British and French ships on the outbreak of war]], and steamed to [[Constantinople]] with two British battlecruisers in hot pursuit. ''Goeben'' was handed over to the Turkish Navy, and this was instrumental in bringing Turkey into the war on the German side. ''Goeben'' herself, renamed ''Yavuz Sultan Selim'', saw engagements against the Russian Navy in the Black Sea and against the British in the Aegean.

====Battle of Heligoland Bight====
{{Main|Battle of Heligoland Bight}}
A force of British light cruisers and destroyers entered the Heligoland Bight to attack German shipping in August 1914, the first month of [[World War I]]. When they met opposition from German cruisers, [[David Beatty, 1st Earl Beatty|Admiral Beatty]] took his squadron of four battlecruisers into the Bight and turned the battle, ultimately sinking three German light cruisers and killing a German commander, Rear Admiral [[Leberecht Maass]].

====Battle of the Falklands====
{{Main|Battle of the Falkland Islands}}
The original battlecruiser concept proved successful in December 1914 at the [[Battle of the Falkland Islands]]. The British battlecruisers [[HMS Inflexible (1907)|''Inflexible'']] and [[HMS Invincible (1907)|''Invincible'']] did precisely the job they were intended for when they chased down and annihilated a [[Germany|German]] cruiser squadron, centered on the armoured cruisers ''[[SMS Scharnhorst|Scharnhorst]]'' and ''[[SMS Gneisenau|Gneisenau]]'', along with three light cruisers, commanded by Admiral [[Maximilian von Spee|Maximilian Graf Von Spee]] in the South Atlantic Ocean. Prior to the battle the Australian battlecruiser ''[[HMAS Australia (1911)|HMAS Australia]]'' had unsuccessfully searched for the German ships in the Pacific.

====Battle of Dogger Bank====
{{Main|Battle of Dogger Bank (1915)}}
[[Image:SMS Seydlitz2.jpg|thumb|[[SMS Seydlitz|SMS ''Seydlitz'']] was heavily damaged in the [[Battle of Dogger Bank (1915)|Battle of Dogger Bank]]]]

During the Battle of Dogger Bank, the after turret of the German flagship ''Seydlitz'' was pierced by a British 13.5&amp;nbsp;inch shell from HMS ''Lion'' which detonated in the working chamber. The charges being hoisted upwards were detonated, and the explosion flashed up into the turret and down into the magazine, setting fire to charges in the process of being handled. The gun crew tried to escape into the next turret, allowing the flash to spread, destroying both turrets internally. ''Seydlitz'' was saved from near-certain destruction only by emergency flooding of her after magazines. This near-disaster was due to the way that ammunition handling was arranged and was common to both German and British battleships and battlecruisers, but the lighter protection on the latter made them more vulnerable to the turret or barbette being pierced. The &quot;working chamber&quot; had been introduced in [[HMS Formidable (1898)|HMS ''Formidable'']] (1898) and was intended to prevent such a dangerous flash, but instead made such an event more likely. The Germans learned from investigating the damaged ''Seydlitz'' and instituted improved measures to ensure ammunition handling was flash tight. The British remained unaware of the weakness, to their great misfortune at the Battle of Jutland.&lt;ref&gt;''Naval Battles of the First World War'', Geoffrey Bennett, Penguin Books Classic Military History, 2001, ISBN 0-14-139087-5&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from the [[cordite]] handling, the battle was mostly inconclusive, though both ''Lion'' and ''Seydlitz'' were severely damaged. The British flagship ''Lion'' lost speed, causing her to fall behind the rest of the battleline, and Admiral Beatty was unable to effectively command for the remainder of the engagement. A British signalling error allowed the German battlecruisers to withdraw, as most of Beatty's squadron mistakenly concentrated on the crippled armoured cruiser ''Blücher'', sinking her with great loss of life. ''Blücher'' herself was obsolete, out of all the ships in the battle, and so she had proved to be a liability to the rest of the German squadron, which was otherwise an all battlecruiser squadron.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

====Battle of Jutland====
{{Main|Battle of Jutland}}
[[Image:Destruction of HMS Queen Mary.jpg|thumb|left|''Queen Mary'' blows up during the Battle of Jutland]]

At the Battle of Jutland 18 months later, both British and German battlecruisers were employed as fleet units. The British battlecruisers became engaged with both their German counterparts, the battlecruisers, and then German battleships before the arrival of the battleships of the [[British Grand Fleet]]. The result was a disaster for the Royal Navy's battlecruiser squadrons: [[HMS Invincible (1907)|''Invincible'']], [[HMS Queen Mary|''Queen Mary'']] and [[HMS Indefatigable (1909)|''Indefatigable'']] exploded with the loss of all but a handful of their crews. This was due to the vulnerability of the working chamber which the Germans had discovered after the near-loss of ''Seydlitz'' at Dogger Bank and had taken preventative measures against. The British ships not only had lighter armour but also lacked flash tight ammunition handling arrangements, due in part to lack of awareness and experience, and also as it would improve their rate of fire to compensate for poor accuracy. Each was lost to a single salvo penetrating the turret and detonating in the working chamber. Beatty's flagship ''Lion'' herself was almost lost in a similar manner, save for the heroic actions of [[Francis John William Harvey|Major Harvey]].

The better armoured and flash-tight German battlecruisers fared better, in part due to poor performance of British fuzes (their shells exploded on impact with the ships armour instead of penetrating the armour before exploding thus causing more damage). [[SMS Lützow|''Lützow'']] for instance only had 117 killed despite receiving more than thirty hits, though she had sufficient flooding that she was scuttled. The other German battlecruisers, [[SMS Moltke (1910)|''Moltke'']], [[SMS Von der Tann|''Von der Tann'']], ''Seydlitz'', [[SMS Derfflinger|''Derfflinger'']] were all heavily damaged and required extensive repairs after the battle, ''Seydlitz'' barely making it home, for they had been in the very centre of enemy fire for much of the battle. No British or German battleship was sunk during the battle with the exception of the old German [[pre-dreadnought]] [[SMS Pommern|''Pommern'']], the victim of torpedoes from British destroyers.

==Interwar period==
In the years immediately after World War I, Britain, Japan and the USA all began design work on a new generation of ever more powerful battleships and battlecruisers. The new burst of shipbuilding which each nation's navy desired was politically controversial and potentially economically crippling. This nascent arms race was prevented by the [[Washington Naval Treaty]] of 1922, where the major naval powers agreed to limits on capital ship numbers. The German navy was not represented at the talks; under the terms of the [[Treaty of Versailles]], Germany was not allowed any modern capital ships at all.

Through the 1920s and early 1930s only Britain and Japan retained battlecruisers, often modified and rebuilt from their original World War I designs. The line between the battlecruiser and the modern fast battleship became blurred; indeed, the Japanese [[Kongō class battlecruiser|''Kongō'' class]] were formally redesignated as battleships.

===Plans in the aftermath of World War I===
[[HMS Hood (51)|HMS ''Hood'']], launched in 1918, was the last First World War battlecruiser to be completed. Owing to lessons from Jutland, ''Hood'' was modified during construction to feature belt armour that was thought to be capable of resisting her own weapons - the classic measure of a &quot;balanced&quot; battleship. ''Hood'' was the largest ship in the Royal Navy when completed; thanks to her great displacement, she in theory combined the firepower and armour of a battleship with the speed of a battlecruiser, causing some to refer to her as a fast battleship. However her protection was markedly less than that of the British battleships built immediately after World War I, the [[Nelson class battleship|Nelson class]].

[[File:Lexington class battlecruiser2.jpg|thumb|''Lexington'' class battlecruiser (painting, c. 1919)]]
The navies of Japan and the United States, seeing a threat from ''Hood'', laid down battlecruisers to rival her. The Imperial Japanese Navy began four ''Amagi'' class battlecruisers. These vessels would have been of unprecedented size and power, being as fast and well armoured as ''HMS Hood'' whilst carrying a main battery of ten 16&quot; guns - the most powerful armament ever proposed for a battlecruiser. The United States Navy responded with the [[Lexington class battle cruiser|''Lexington'']] class battlecruisers, which if completed as planned would have been exceptionally fast and well armed with eight 16&quot; guns, but would have carried armour little better than that of the very first battlecruisers. The final stage in the post-war battlecruiser race came with the British response to the ''Amagi'' and ''Lexington'' types: four 48,000 ton [[G3 battlecruiser]]s. Royal Navy documents of the period often described any [[battleship]] with a speed of over about 24&amp;nbsp;[[knot (speed)|knot]]s (44&amp;nbsp;km/h) as a battlecruiser, regardless of the amount of protective armour, although the G3 was considered by most to be a well-balanced fast battleship.&lt;ref name=&quot;GWPDA&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Origins and Development of the Battlecruiser | url=http://www.gwpda.org/naval/bcs001.htm | publisher=Great War Primary Documents Archive | accessdate=2006-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NHistory&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Battleships, Battlecruisers &amp; Monitors | url=http://www.naval-history.net/WW2RN24-BritishShipsBattleships.htm | publisher=Naval-History.net | accessdate=2006-06-25 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060613224926/http://www.naval-history.net/WW2RN24-BritishShipsBattleships.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Washington Naval Treaty meant that none of these designs came to fruition. Those ships which had been started were either broken up on the slipway or converted into aircraft carriers.

In Japan, ''Amagi'' and [[Japanese aircraft carrier Akagi|''Akagi'']] were taken in hand for conversion into [[aircraft carriers]]. In 1923 the ''Amagi'' was damaged beyond repair by an earthquake and was broken up on the slips, the hull of one of the proposed ''Tosa'' class battleships, [[Japanese aircraft carrier Kaga|''Kaga,'']] being converted in her stead.

In Britain, Fisher's &quot;large light cruisers&quot; were converted to carriers. [[HMS Furious (1916)|''Furious'']] had already been converted to an aircraft carrier during the war and [[HMS Glorious (77)|''Glorious'']] and [[HMS Courageous (50)|''Courageous'']], which had no place in the post-Treaty navy, were similarly converted.

The [[United States Navy]] also re-tasked two battlecruiser hulls as aircraft carriers in the wake of the Washington Treaty: [[USS Lexington (CV-2)|USS ''Lexington'']] and [[USS Saratoga (CV-3)|''Saratoga'']] were both designed as battlecruisers (the hull designations were originally CC-1 and CC-3) but converted part-way through construction, although this was only considered marginally preferable to scrapping the hulls outright (the remaining four: ''Constellation'', ''Ranger'', ''Constitution'' and ''United States'' were indeed scrapped).

===Rebuilding programmes===
[[Image:HMS Repulse (1919) profile drawing.png|thumb|left|350px|''Repulse'' as she was in 1919]]

[[Image:HMS Renown (1939) profile drawing.png|thumb|left|350px|''Renown'', as reconstructed, in 1939]]
In total, nine battlecruisers survived the Washington Naval Treaty. Their high speed made them valuable surface units in spite of their weaknesses so most of these ships were significantly updated before World War II, although the Royal Navy sold ''HMS Tiger'' for scrap in 1932 on the grounds that she was worn out, and in addition, the Turks did not have the means to upgrade the ''Sultan Yavuz Selim'' (ex ''Goeben'' of the Imperial German Navy).

[[HMS Renown (1916)|HMS ''Renown'']] and [[HMS Repulse (1916)|''Repulse'']] were modernized significantly in a series of refits between 1920 and 1939. Like several elderly British capital ships, the ''Renown'' underwent a total reconstruction between 1937 and 1939 to make her suitable for acting as a fast heavy escort warship for aircraft carriers. Similar rebuildings planned for the ''Repulse'' and the ''Hood'' were cancelled by the events of World War II.

[[Image:Kongo 1925-28.jpg|thumb|The [[Japanese battleship Kongo|''Kongo'']] as she appeared during the 20s, after conversion to a [[fast battleship]]]]

Unable to pursue new construction, the Imperial Japanese Navy also chose to improve its existing battlecruisers of the [[Japanese battleship Kongō|''Kongō'' class]] (the [[Japanese battleship Hiei|''Hiei'']], the [[Japanese battleship Haruna|''Haruna'']], the [[Japanese battleship Kirishima|''Kirishima'']], and the [[Japanese battleship Kongō|''Kongō'']]) by increasing the elevation of their guns to 40 degrees, adding anti-torpedo bulges and additional armour, and building on a &quot;pagoda&quot; mast. The 3,800 tons of additional armour slowed their speeds, but between 1933 and 1940, replacement of heavy equipment and an increase in the length of the hull by 26&amp;nbsp;ft (8.0 m) allowed them to reach up to {{convert|30|kn|km/h|-1}} once again. They were reclassified as &quot;fast battleships&quot; and their high speed made them suitable as aircraft carrier escorts, although their armour and guns still fell short compared to surviving World War I–era battleships in the American or the British navies.

===Naval rearmament===
In the late 1930s navies began to build capital ships again, and during this period number of large commerce raiders and small, fast battleships were built. While the design philosophy behind these ships was very different from that of the original battlecruisers, the term was adopted from time to time for these new ships.

Germany, Italy, France and Russia all designed new vessels in this category, though only Germany and France completed them.Ultimately the Italians chose to upgrade their old battleships rather than build new battlecruisers, whereas the Russians laid down the 35,000 ton ''[[Kronshtadt class battlecruiser|Kronshtadt]] ''Class, but were unable to launch them before the Germans invaded in 1941 and captured one of the hulls. The other Soviet ship was launched and scrapped after the war.

The German [[pocket battleships]] (German:''Panzerschiffe'' - ''armoured ship''), were ships built to meet the limitations of the [[Treaty of Versailles]] which forbad Germany from exceeding 10,000 tons or six 28.0&amp;nbsp;cm (11-inch) guns. While their 12,000-ton displacement was similar to that of a [[heavy cruiser]], their armament was more powerful; heavy cruisers were restricted to 8-inch guns by the [[Treaty of London]]. They were, in fact similar to the armored cruisers of an earlier era. This intermediate status and their superficial appearance to battleships resulted in the term &quot;pocket battleship&quot;. However, their mission was long-range commerce raiding and their capabilities were inferior to those of any battleship or battlecruiser.

The first German capital ships of the 1930s were [[German battleship Scharnhorst|''Scharnhorst'']] and the [[German battleship Gneisenau|''Gneisenau'']]. The Royal Navy categorized them as battlecruisers, while the German Navy referred to them as ''schlachtschiffe'' or battleship. At 31,500 tons standard displacement, they were intermediate in size between ''Repulse'' or ''Renown'' and the 35,000-ton limit for battleships. Their top speed of 33 knots exceeded that of existing battlecruisers and battleships and their armoured protection was modelled on that of a battleship. Their armament was light, for a capital ship; ''Scharnhorst'' and ''Gneisenau'' carried nine 280&amp;nbsp;mm (11-inch) gun turrets (though with provision to change to replace these with six 380&amp;nbsp;mm (15&amp;nbsp;inch)). Their design thus compromised on armament for high speed and strong protection.

[[Image:Dunkerque-206a4020.jpg|left|thumb|Plans of the French battlecruiser [[French battleship Dunkerque|''Dunkerque'']]]]
The French response to the &quot;pocket battleships&quot; was the [[French battleship Dunkerque|''Dunkerque'' class]] in the 1930s. Displacing 26,500 tons and armed with eight 330&amp;nbsp;mm (13&amp;nbsp;inch) guns arranged in two quadruple turrets located forward, they were significantly larger and more powerful than the pocket battleships. Their speed (30 knots) was in line with other fast battleships, and they were armoured as heavily as possible as their light displacement allowed.

==World War II==
===Commerce raiding===
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2011}}
In the early years of the war the German ships each had a measure of success hunting merchant ships in the [[Atlantic]]. The [[pocket battleships]] were deployed alone and sank a number of vessels, causing disruption to the trade routes which supplied the [[United Kingdom|UK]]. They were pursued by the [[Royal Navy]] and on one occasion, at the [[Battle of the River Plate]] in 1939, the hunter became the hunted.

''Admiral Graf Spee'' had been at sea at the start of World War II and engaged in a successful commerce raiding spree. Off the coast of South America, ''Admiral Graf Spee'' encountered the British heavy cruiser [[HMS Exeter (68)|''Exeter'']] and light cruisers [[HMNZS Achilles (70)|''Achilles'']] and [[HMS Ajax (22)|''Ajax'']]. ''Admiral Graf Spee'' inflicted heavy damage on ''Exeter'' but in turn suffered considerable topside damage from the light cruisers. The pocket battleship's armour mostly held, but she sustained several critical hits which would have made the ship unseaworthy for returning to Germany, and she was forced to retire to neutral [[Uruguay]]. Unable to stay in port any longer without internment, and led to believe by the nature of British radio transmissions that aircraft carriers and {{convert|15|in|mm|0|sing=on}} gunned battlecruisers were too close to evade, her captain elected to scuttle his ship, and then accepted responsibility for its destruction by committing suicide.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refChurchill1986|Churchill 1986]], p. 474.&lt;/ref&gt;

Allied battlecruisers such as {{HMS|Renown|1916|2}}, {{HMS|Repulse|1916|2}}, ''Dunkerque'' and [[French battleship Strasbourg|''Strasbourg'']] were employed on operations to hunt down the commerce raiding German battlecruisers, but they rarely got close to their targets, ''Renown'' enjoying a brief clash against the German 11-inch battlecruisers, scoring three non-critical hits on ''Gneisenau'' but being unable to keep up in bad weather. The [[Battle of the Denmark Strait|one stand-up fight]] occurred when the battleship [[German battleship Bismarck|''Bismarck'']] was sent out as a raider and was intercepted by {{HMS|Hood|51|6}} and the battleship {{HMS|Prince of Wales|1939|2}} in May 1941. The elderly British battlecruiser was no match for the modern German battleship: within minutes, the ''Bismarck''{{'}}s 15&amp;nbsp;inch shells caused a magazine explosion in ''Hood'' reminiscent of the Battle of Jutland. Only three men survived.

[[German battleship Gneisenau|''Gneisenau'']] and [[German battleship Scharnhorst|''Scharnhorst'']] hunted together and were initially successful at commerce raiding, sinking the British [[armed merchant cruiser]] {{HMS|Rawalpindi||2}} in 1939. Following repairs from damage during the [[Norwegian campaign]], the two battlecruisers set out commerce raiding once again in 1941 and sank 22 merchant ships. They returned to [[Brest, France|Brest]] in northern France but found this port was vulnerable to [[Royal Air Force]] attacks and were obliged to return to Germany. They did so in the [[Channel Dash]], a daring and successful run up the [[English Channel]]. They were both damaged by mines and although ''Scharnhorst'' was repaired, ''Gneisenau'' was damaged again in [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] bombing raids and was eventually disarmed and sunk as a blockship. ''Scharnhorst'' was employed once more to attack commerce and attempted to raid the [[Arctic convoys of World War II|Arctic convoys]] in December 1943. She was surprised by the battleship {{HMS|Duke of York|17|2}} with the cruisers {{HMS|Jamaica|C44|2}}, {{HMS|Norfolk|78|2}} and {{HMS|Belfast||2}} at the [[Battle of North Cape]] and sunk on 26 December 1943. The {{convert|14|in|mm|0|sing=on}} gunfire from ''Duke of York'' crippled her turrets and engine room, then the attendant British cruisers and destroyers closed in and finished her off with torpedoes.

The use of battlecruisers as commerce raiders was curtailed following an attack by the [[German pocket battleship Admiral Scheer|''Admiral Scheer'']] on a convoy guarded by the [[HMS Jervis Bay (F40)|HMS ''Jervis Bay'']], an [[armed merchant cruiser]]. It persuaded the British [[Admiralty]] that convoys had to be guarded by battleships or battlecruisers. The older R-class battleships and the un-upgraded ''Queen Elizabeth''s ([[HMS Malaya|''Malaya'']] and [[HMS Barham (04)|''Barham'']]) were used for this task, for which they were quite adequate despite their age, and subsequently the smaller German ships were forced away from their quarry. Additionally, the air gap over the North Atlantic closed, [[Huff-Duff]] (radio triangulation equipment) improved, airborne [[History of radar#World War II Radar|centimetric radar]] was introduced and convoys received [[escort aircraft carrier|escort carrier]] protection. The results of some of these developments were illustrated by the successful defence of convoys at the [[Battle of the Barents Sea]] and the [[Battle of the North Cape]].

By comparison with the critical role of submarines during the [[Battle of the North Atlantic]] the commerce-raiding role of battlecruisers was marginal in its impact on the outcome of the war. Big ships with big guns were increasingly obsolete.

===Norwegian campaign===
The Royal Navy and the [[Kriegsmarine]] both deployed battlecruisers during the Norwegian campaign in April 1940. The [[German battleship Gneisenau|''Gneisenau'']] and the [[German battleship Scharnhorst|''Scharnhorst'']] were engaged by [[HMS Renown (1916)|HMS ''Renown'']]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bobhenneman.info/bhrsg.htm|title=Renown Vs Scharnhorst and Gneisenau|accessdate=2008-07-18 |last= Henneman |first= Bob  |authorlink= |year= |publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in very bad weather and although they had stronger armour than their counterpart, the British ship could hit them harder and at a longer range because the German ships were having difficulty with their radars. They disengaged after ''Gneisenau'' sustained damage. One of ''Renown'''s 15-inch shells passed through ''Gneisenau''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s director tower without exploding, severing electrical and communication cables as it went. The debris caused by the passing shell killed one officer and five enlisted men, and destroyed the optical rangefinder for the forward 150&amp;nbsp;mm turrets. Main battery fire control had to be shifted aft due to the loss of electrical power to the director tower. Another shell from ''Renown'' struck the aft turret of ''Gneisenau'', knocking it out of action.

Later in the campaign they returned and sank the light aircraft carrier [[HMS Glorious|HMS ''Glorious'']] (a converted battlecruiser herself) and her destroyer escort. One of the destroyers ([[HMS Acasta (H09)|HMS ''Acasta'']]) succeeded in damaging the ''Scharnhorst'' with a torpedo, and later a submarine did the same to ''Gneisenau'', forcing both ships to spend several months in repair. The [[pocket battleship]] [[German pocket battleship Deutschland|''Lützow'']] was similarly damaged by [[HMS Spearfish (69S)|HMS ''Spearfish'']] during the campaign.

===Mediterranean===
The French battlecruisers had fled to North Africa following the [[Battle of France|fall of France]]. In July 1940 [[Force H]] under Admiral [[James Somerville (admiral)|James Somerville]] was ordered to force their surrender or destroy them. The ''Dunkerque'' was damaged by shells from HMS ''Hood'' at [[Mers-el-Kebir]] but escaped to join the ''Strasbourg'' at [[Toulon]]. Both ships were scuttled on 27 November 1942, although ''Strasbourg'' was raised and used by the Italian navy before being sunk again in an air attack on 18 August 1944.

===Pacific War===
The first battlecruiser to see action in the Pacific War was [[HMS Repulse (1916)|''Repulse'']] when she was sunk near [[Singapore]] on December 10, 1941 whilst in company with [[HMS Prince of Wales (1939)|HMS ''Prince of Wales'']]. She had received a refit to give extra anti-aircraft protection and extra armour between the wars. Unlike her sister ''Renown'', ''Repulse'' did not receive a full rebuild as planned, which would have added [[Anti-torpedo bulge|anti-torpedo blisters]]. During the [[Sinking of Prince of Wales and Repulse|Sea Battle off Malaya]], her speed and agility enabled her to hold her own and dodge 19 torpedoes. Without aerial cover she eventually succumbed to the continuous waves of Japanese bombers, and without enhanced underwater protection she went down quickly after a few torpedo hits.

The Japanese ''Kongō'' class battlecruisers were significantly upgraded and re-rated as &quot;fast battleships&quot;, and they were used extensively as carrier escorts for most of their wartime career due to their high speed. Their World War I-era armament was weaker and their upgraded armour was still thin compared to contemporary battleships.&lt;ref name=&quot;navweaps.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.navweaps.com/index_lundgren/Kirishima_Damage_Analysis.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Naval Battle of Guadalcanal]] on 12 November the [[Japanese battleship Hiei|''Hiei'']] was sent out to bombard US positions. She suffered extensive topside damage from gunfire of US cruisers and destroyers, but, more critically, her steering gear was incapacitated by an 8-inch shell. The next day, ''Hiei'' was attacked by waves of aircraft from Guadalcanal’s American held airfield ([[Henderson Field (Guadalcanal)|Henderson Field]]), which eventually made salvage impossible, and so she was left to sink north of [[Savo Island]]. A few days later on 15 November 1942, [[Japanese battleship Kirishima|''Kirishima'']] engaged the U.S. battleships [[USS South Dakota (BB-57)|''South Dakota'']] and [[USS Washington (BB-56)|''Washington'']], and was sunk following mortal damage from at least nine 16-inch hits inflicted by the ''Washington'', which disabled her forward main turrets, jammed her steering, and holed her below the waterline.&lt;ref name=&quot;navweaps.com&quot;/&gt; In contrast ''South Dakota'' survived 42 hits (including only one 14-inch hit, but many 8-in. heavy cruiser shells), all to her superstructure, and was back in operation four months later. The [[Japanese battleship Kongō|''Kongō'']] survived the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]], but she was sunk on 21 November 1944 in the [[Formosa Strait]] by three [[torpedo]]es from the [[U.S. Navy]] [[submarine]] ''[[USS Sealion (SS-315)]]''and poor damage control.

==Large cruisers or &quot;cruiser killers&quot;==
[[Image:Uss alaska cb.jpg|thumb|left|[[USS Alaska (CB-1)|USS ''Alaska'']], one of the [[United States Navy]]'s two &quot;large cruisers&quot;]]

{{See also|Alaska class cruiser|Design 1047 battlecruiser}}

On the eve of World War II, there was a late renaissance in popularity of ships between battleships and cruisers. While some considered them battlecruisers, they were never classified as capital ships, and they were variously described as &quot;super-cruisers&quot;, &quot;large cruisers&quot; or even &quot;unrestricted cruisers&quot;. They were optimised as cruiser-killers, fleet scouts and commerce raiders. The Dutch, Japanese, Soviets and Americans all planned new classes specifically to counter the large heavy cruisers being built by their naval rivals - especially the Japanese ''[[Mogami class cruiser|Mogami]]'' class cruisers. The Germans also designed a class of lightly protected battlecruisers.

The first such battlecruisers were the Dutch [[Design 1047 battlecruiser|Design 1047]]. Never officially assigned names, the Dutch wanted them to protect their colonies in the [[Dutch East Indies|East Indies]] in the face of Japanese aggression. Designed with the assistance of the Germans and Italians, they broadly resembled the German ''Scharnhorst'' class and had the same main battery, but would have been considerably lighter and only protected against {{convert|8|in|mm|0|sing=on}} gunfire. Although the design was completed, work on the vessels never commenced as the Germans overran the Netherlands in May 1940, while the first ship would have been laid down in June of that year.

[[File:CB-1 Alaska Outboard Profile.png|thumb|right|Drawing of the ''Alaska class'']]

The Germans planned to build three battlecruisers of the [[O Class battlecruiser|O Class]] as part of the expansion of the [[Kriegsmarine]] ([[Plan Z]]). With six 15&amp;nbsp;inch (38&amp;nbsp;cm) guns, high speed, excellent range but very thin armour, they were intended as commerce raiders. Only one of these was ordered shortly before World War II broke out and no work was ever done on it. No names were assigned, and they were known as ''O'', ''P'', and ''Q''.  The new class was not universally welcomed in the Kriegsmarine, their abnormally light protection gaining the class the derogatory nickname ''Ohne Panzer Quatsch'' (without armour nonsense) within certain circles of the Navy.

The only class of these late battlecruisers to be laid down were the United States Navy's three [[Alaska class cruiser|''Alaska'' class]] &quot;large cruisers&quot;, [[USS Alaska (CB-1)|''Alaska'']], [[USS Guam (CB-2)|''Guam'']] and [[USS Hawaii (CB-3)|''Hawaii'']] - of which only ''Alaska'' and ''Guam'' were completed. The ''Alaskas'' were classified as &quot;large cruisers&quot; instead of battlecruisers, and their status as non-capital ships is evidenced by the fact that they were named for territories or protectorates (as opposed to battleships, which were named after states, or cruisers, which were commonly named after cities). But with a main armament of nine 12-inch (305&amp;nbsp;mm) guns in three triple turrets and a displacement of 27,000 tons, the ''Alaskas'' were twice the size of the preceding [[Baltimore class cruiser|''Baltimore'' class]] cruisers and had guns some 50% larger in diameter. They lacked the thick armoured belt and torpedo defense system of true capital ships and, unlike most battlecruisers, they were considered a balanced design (according to cruiser standards) as their protection could withstand fire from their own caliber of gun, albeit only in a very narrow range band. They were designed to hunt down Japanese heavy cruisers, though by the time they entered service most Japanese cruisers had been sunk by American aircraft or submarines. Like the contemporary [[Iowa class battleship|''Iowa''-class]] fast battleships, their speed ultimately made them more useful as carrier escorts and bombardment ships than as the sea combatants they were developed to be. ''Hawaii'' was 84% complete when hostilities ceased, and was laid up for years while various plans were debated to convert her large hull into a missile ship or a command vessel; she would eventually be scrapped incomplete.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hawaii DANFS&quot;&gt;{{cite DANFS | title = Hawaii | url = http://hazegray.org/danfs/cruisers/cb3.txt | accessdate=14 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three additional hulls, to be named ''Philippines'', ''Puerto Rico'' and ''Samoa'', were cancelled outright.

The Japanese started designing the B64 class, which were similar to the ''Alaska'' but with {{convert|12.2|in|mm|0|sing=on}} guns. News of the ''Alaskas'' led them to upgrade the design, creating the B65. Armed with {{convert|14|in|mm|0|sing=on}} guns, the B65's would have been the best armed of the new breed of battlecruisers, but they still would have had only sufficient protection to keep out 8-inch shells. Much like the Dutch battlecruisers, the Japanese got as far as completing the design for the B65s, but never laid them down. By the time the designs were ready the Japanese Navy recognised that they had little use for the vessels and that their priority for construction should lie with aircraft carriers. Like the ''Alaska''s, the Japanese did not call these ships battlecruisers, referring to them instead as supersized heavy cruisers.

==Cold War designs==
In spite of the fact that World War II had demonstrated battleships and battlecruisers to be generally obsolete, [[Joseph Stalin]]'s fondness for big gun armed warships caused the [[Soviet Union]] to plan several large cruiser classes in the late 1940s and early 1950s that would be a response for the ''Alaska'' class vessels. In the [[Soviet Union]], as in many other languages, they were called &quot;heavy cruisers&quot; (''thyazholyi kreyser'').

The fruits of this program were the [[Stalingrad Class Battlecruiser|project 82 (''Stalingrad'')]] cruisers, with 36,500 tons standard load (42,300 tons full load), 9 guns 305&amp;nbsp;mm and a speed of {{convert|35|kn|km/h|0}}. Three ships were laid in 1951–52, but after Stalin's death they were canceled in April 1953. Apart from high costs, the main reason was that gun-armed ships became obsolete with an advent of guided missiles. Only a central armoured hull section of the first cruiser ''Stalingrad'' was launched in 1954 and then used as a target for rockets.
[[Image:Kirov-class battlecruiser.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Admiral Lazarev'', formerly the ''Frunze'', the second ship of her class of battlecruiser]]

The Soviet [[Kirov class battlecruiser|''Kirov'' class]] of ''Tyazholyy Atomnyy Raketny Kreyser'' (Heavy Nuclear-powered Missile Cruiser), displacing approximately 26,000 tons, is classified as a battlecruiser in the 1996–7 edition of ''[[Jane's Fighting Ships]]'', even though in actuality they are very large missile cruisers. Their classification as battlecruisers arises from their displacement, which is roughly equal to that of a World War I [[battleship]], and the fact that they possess more firepower than nearly every other surface ship. The ''Kirov''-class lacks the heavy armour that distinguishes battlecruisers from regular cruisers and they are classified as &quot;heavy missile cruisers&quot; in [[Russia]]. There were four members of the class completed, [[Soviet battlecruiser Kirov|''Kirov'']], [[Soviet battlecruiser Frunze|''Frunze'']], [[Soviet battlecruiser Kalinin|''Kalinin'']], and [[RFS Pyotr Velikiy|''Yuri Andropov'']]. As the ships were named after Communist personalities, after the fall of the USSR they were given traditional names of the Imperial Russian Navy, respectively ''Admiral Ushakov'', ''Admiral Lazarev'', ''Admiral Nakhimov'', and ''Pyotr Velikiy''. Due to budget constraints two members of this class have been decommissioned, although ''Pyotr Velikiy'' and ''Admiral Nakhimov'' are in active service and funds are being gathered for possible repair of ''Admiral Lazarev''. ''Nakhimov'' was returned to service early, at the beginning of 2006, possibly due to increasing tensions in the [[Middle East]] and potential Russian naval involvement therein.

'''Robert James Lee &quot;Bob&quot; Hawke''' [[Order of Australia|AC]] [[Order of Logohu|GCL]] (born 9 December 1929) was the [[List of Prime Ministers of Australia|23rd]] [[Prime Minister of Australia]] and longest serving [[Australian Labor Party]] Prime Minister.

After a decade as president of the [[Australian Council of Trade Unions]], he entered politics at the [[Australian federal election, 1980|1980 federal election]] and became Prime Minister within three years. He became by far the longest-serving and most electorally successful [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] Prime Minister, achieving the rare feat of winning four consecutive federal elections after coming to power at the [[Australian federal election, 1983|1983 federal election]]. He is Australia's third longest-serving Prime Minister.

==Early life and education==
[[Image:BobHawkeYardofale.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Hawke's memorial at the [[Turf Tavern]] for downing a [[yard of ale]] ({{convert|2.5|imppt|l|abbr=none|disp=or}}) in just 11 seconds in 1963 [''sic''] while at Oxford Uni, a record at the time, and entered in the [[Guinness Book of Records]]. The record was actually set in 1953.]]
Hawke was born in [[Bordertown, South Australia|Bordertown]], a small town in [[South Australia]] near the Victorian border. His father Clem was a [[Congregational church|Congregationalist]] minister; his uncle, [[Albert Hawke]], was Labor [[Premier of Western Australia]] between 1953 and 1959 and was a close friend of Labor Prime Minister [[John Curtin]], who was in many ways Bob Hawke's [[role model]]. Hawke's mother, Ellie, had an almost messianic belief in her son's destiny&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, G., ''et al'' (1998), p. 302&lt;/ref&gt; and this contributed to his supreme self-confidence throughout his career. Both his parents were of [[Cornish Australian|Cornish]] origins&lt;ref&gt;Rowse, A.L. The little land of Cornwall, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; and he himself has stated that his background is Cornish.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Ricketson, The best Australian profiles&amp;nbsp;— Page 30, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; This led the Cornish writer and historian [[A.L. Rowse]] to write &quot;Bob Hawke's characteristics are as Cornish as Australian. I know them well: the aggressive individualism, the egoism, the touchiness, the liability to resentment, even a touch of vindictiveness.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Sydney Cauveren. A.L. Rowse: a bibliophile's extensive bibliography, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; While attending the 1952 [[World Christian Youth Conference]], held in [[Kottayam]] in southern India, Hawke was struck by &quot;this enormous sense of irrelevance of religion to the needs of the people&quot; and abandoned his [[Christian]] beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode | title = Elders Part 5: Bob Hawke | url = http://www.abc.net.au/tv/enoughrope/transcripts/s2301431.htm | series = Elders with Andrew Denton | serieslink = Enough Rope | airdate = 11 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time he entered politics he was a self-described [[agnostic]].&lt;ref&gt;Blanche d'Alpuget, ''Robert J. Hawke'', 87&lt;/ref&gt;

Hawke was raised in [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] and attended [[Perth Modern School]] and completed undergraduate degrees in Law and Arts (Economics) at the [[University of Western Australia]]. At age 15, he boasted that he would one day become Prime Minister of Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Iyer |first=Pico |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,951966-1,00.html |title=Australia: Hawke Swoops into Power&amp;nbsp;— Time/CNN 14&amp;nbsp;March 1983 |publisher=Time.com |date=14 March 1983 |accessdate=25 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He joined the Labor Party in 1947, and successfully applied for a [[Rhodes Scholarship|Rhodes Scholar]]ship at the end of 1952.&lt;ref&gt;Hurst, J., (1983), p.18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hawke, Bob (1994), p.19&lt;/ref&gt; In 1953, Hawke went to the [[University of Oxford]] to commence a Bachelor of Arts at [[University College, Oxford|University College]].&lt;ref&gt;Hawke, Bob (1994), p.24&lt;/ref&gt; He soon found he was covering much the same ground as his Bachelor's degree from Perth, and switched to a Bachelor of Letters, with a thesis on wage-fixing in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Hurst, J., (1983), p.20&lt;/ref&gt; The thesis was successfully presented in January 1956.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Hawke, Bob (1994), p.28&lt;/ref&gt;

His academic achievements were complemented by setting a new world speed record for beer drinking: a [[yard (beer)|yard glass]] (approximately 3 imperial pints or 1.7 litres) in eleven seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mediaman.com.au/articles/spiffing.html |title=Media Man Australia&amp;nbsp;– The Online Home of Greg Tingle&amp;nbsp;– Journalist &amp; TV Presenter |publisher=Mediaman.com.au |date=3 December 2003 |accessdate=25 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his memoirs, Hawke suggested that this single feat may have contributed to his political success more than any other, by endearing him to a voting population with a strong beer culture.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

In March 1956, Hawke married [[Hazel Hawke|Hazel Masterson]], at Trinity Church, Perth, Western Australia.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;Hurst, J., (1983), p.25&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, Hawke accepted a scholarship to undertake doctoral studies in the area of arbitration law in the law department of the [[Australian National University]] (ANU), Canberra.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; Soon after arrival at ANU, Hawke became the students' representative on the University Council.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

In 1957, Hawke was recommended to the ACTU president Albert Monk for the position of ACTU research officer to replace Harold Souter, who had become ACTU secretary. The recommendation was made by Hawke's mentor at ANU, H.P. Brown, who for a number of years had assisted the ACTU in national wage cases. Hawke decided to abandon his doctoral studies and accept the offer. The Hawke family moved to Melbourne.&lt;ref&gt;Hurst, J., (1983), p.26&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trade union leader==
Not long after Hawke began work at the ACTU, he became responsible for the presentation of its annual case for higher wages to the national wages tribunal, the [[Australian Industrial Relations Commission|Conciliation and Arbitration Commission]]. He was first appointed as the ACTU advocate in 1959. The 1958 case, under advocate R.L Eggleston, had yielded only a five-shilling increase.&lt;ref&gt;Hurst (1983), p.27&lt;/ref&gt; The 1959 case found for a fifteen-shilling increase, and was regarded as a personal triumph for Hawke.&lt;ref&gt;Hurst (1983), p.31&lt;/ref&gt;  He went on to attain such success and prominence in his role as ACTU advocate, that in 1969 he was encouraged to run for ACTU President, despite the fact that he had never held elected office in a trade union.

He was elected to the presidency of the ACTU in 1969 on a modernising platform, by a narrow margin (399 to 350)&lt;ref&gt;Hurst, J., (1983), p.78&lt;/ref&gt; and with the support of the left of the union movement, including some associated with the [[Communist Party of Australia|Communist Party]].

Hawke declared publicly that &quot;[[socialism|socialist]] is not a word I would use to describe myself&quot; and his approach to government was [[pragmatism|pragmatic]]. He concerned himself with making improvements to workers' lives from within the traditional institutions of government, rather than to any ideological theory. He opposed the [[Vietnam war]], but was a strong supporter of the US-Australian alliance, and also an emotional supporter of [[Israel]]. It was his commitment to the cause of Jewish [[Refuseniks]] that led to a planned assassination attempt by the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine]], and its Australian operative [[Munif Mohammed Abou Rish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/palestinian-plot-to-kill-hawke/2006/12/31/1167500010729.html |title=Terrorists plotted Hawke assassination: ASIO&amp;nbsp;– National&amp;nbsp;– |publisher=Theage.com.au |date=31 December 2006 |accessdate=25 April 2010 | location=Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In industrial matters, Hawke continued to demonstrate a preference for and considerable skill at negotiation, and was generally liked and respected by employers as well as the unions he advocated for. As early as 1972 speculation began that he would soon enter Parliament and become Labor leader. But while his career continued successfully, his heavy use of alcohol and his notorious womanising&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, G., et al (1998), p. 303&lt;/ref&gt; placed considerable strains on his family life.

In 1973 Hawke became Federal President of the Labor Party. When the [[Gough Whitlam]] government was controversially [[Australian constitutional crisis of 1975|dismissed by the Governor-General]] in 1975 and the government defeated at the ensuing election, Whitlam initially offered the Labor leadership to Hawke, although it was not within Whitlam's power to decide who would succeed him.&lt;ref&gt;Hawke (1994), p.70&lt;/ref&gt; Hawke decided not to enter Parliament at that time, a decision he soon regretted. He was, however, influential in averting national strike action.&lt;ref&gt;Hurst, J., (1983), p.198&lt;/ref&gt; The strain of this period took its toll, and in 1979 he suffered a physical collapse.

This shock led Hawke to make a sustained and ultimately successful effort to conquer his [[alcoholism]]&amp;nbsp;– [[John Curtin]] was his inspiration in this as in other things. He was helped in this by his relationship with the writer [[Blanche d'Alpuget]], who in 1982 published an admiring biography of Hawke. His popularity with the public was unaffected, and polling suggested that he was a far more popular politician than either [[Bill Hayden]], the Labor leader since 1977, or the incumbent [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]] Prime Minister [[Malcolm Fraser]].

==Parliamentarian==
Hawke initially attempted to enter parliament at the [[Australian federal election, 1963|1963 federal election]] in the seat of [[Division of Corio|Corio]] and achieved a 3.1 percent swing against the national trend, but fell short.&lt;ref&gt;[http://psephos.adam-carr.net/countries/a/australia/1963/1963repsvic.txt] {{Dead link|date=May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, he was elected to the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] for the [[Melbourne]] seat of [[Division of Wills|Wills]] at the [[Australian federal election, 1980|1980 election]] held on 18 October. Immediately upon his entry into Parliament, Hawke was appointed to the Opposition front bench, taking his place as Shadow Minister for Industrial Relations, Employment and Youth.&lt;ref&gt;Hurst, J., (1983), p. 262&lt;/ref&gt; With the opinion polls indicating that Hawke was 'a certain election winner',&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, P., (1992), p.24&lt;/ref&gt; Hayden called a leadership ballot for 16 July 1982. Although Hayden defeated the ambitious Hawke, his five vote victory over the former President of the ACTU was not large enough to dispel doubts in caucus that he could lead the ALP to victory at the next election, due sometime in the forthcoming year.&lt;ref&gt;Hurst, J., (1983), p. 269&lt;/ref&gt;

Hayden's leadership was further questioned when Labor performed poorly in a December 1982 [[by-election]] for the Victorian seat of [[Division of Flinders|Flinders]], following the resignation of the former Liberal minister, Sir [[Phillip Lynch]]. Labor needed a swing of 5.5% to win the seat, but only achieved 3%.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;Hurst, J., (1983), p. 270&lt;/ref&gt; This convinced many doubters within caucus that only Hawke could guarantee a Labor victory at the upcoming election. Labor party power-brokers such as [[Graham Richardson]] and [[Barrie Unsworth]] now lined up behind Hawke.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;  More significantly, Hayden's staunch friend and political ally, Labor senate Leader [[John Button]], eventually became convinced that Hawke's chances of victory were greater than Hayden's. Button's influence was crucial in encouraging Hayden's decision to resign less than two months after Labor's lacklustre performance in Flinders.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hurst, J., 1983, p. 273&quot;&gt;Hurst, J., (1983), p. 273&lt;/ref&gt; Hawke's leadership ambitions were realised when Hayden announced his resignation as Labor leader on the morning of 3 February 1983, at a meeting of the shadow ministry in [[Brisbane]].  Hawke was named interim leader.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hurst, J., 1983, p. 273&quot;/&gt; The same day, Fraser, hoping to capitalise on Labor's feuding, and unaware of events that had taken place in Brisbane, called a [[double dissolution]] [[Australian federal election, 1983|election for 5 March]].&lt;ref&gt;Hurst, J., (1983), p. 275&lt;/ref&gt; He believed he'd caught Labor before it could replace Hayden, and was surprised to find out Hayden had resigned mere hours before the writs were dropped.  Hawke was formally elected Hayden's successor five days later. Twenty five days later, Labor won power on a 24-seat swing, ending seven years of conservative rule.

==Prime Minister 1983–91==
{{Main|Hawke-Keating Government}}
[[Image:BannonHawke.jpg|right|thumb|A cheque for [[Ash Wednesday fires|Ash Wednesday]] bushfire relief to [[South Australia]]n [[Premier of South Australia|Premier]] [[John Bannon]] is presented by Hawke in April 1983.]]
The inaugural days of the Hawke government were distinctly different from those of the Whitlam era. Rather than immediately initiating extensive reform programmes, Hawke announced that Fraser's pre-election concealment of the budget deficit meant that many of Labor's election commitments would have to be deferred.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kelly, P., 1992, p.57&quot;&gt;Kelly, P., (1992), p.57&lt;/ref&gt; Hawke managed to persuade the Labor caucus to divide the ministry into two tiers, with only the most important ministers attending regular cabinet meetings. Caucus still selected the full ministry, but allowed Hawke to select which ministers would comprise the 13-strong inner cabinet.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;Kelly, P., (1992), p.30&lt;/ref&gt;  This was to avoid what Hawke viewed as the unwieldy nature of the 27-member Whitlam cabinet. The caucus under Hawke also exhibited a much more formalised system of parliamentary [[political faction|factions]], which significantly altered the dynamics of caucus operations.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;

Hawke used his great authority to carry out a substantial set of policy changes. Accounts from ministers indicate that while Hawke was not usually the driving force for economic reform (that impetus coming from the Treasurer [[Paul Keating]] and Industry Minister [[John Button]]), he took the role of reaching consensus and providing political guidance on what was electorally feasible and how best to sell it to the public, at which he was highly successful. Hawke proved to be very popular with the Australian electorate and continues to hold the highest historical ACNielsen approval rating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title= The biggest hammering in history|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2008/05/19/1211182705614.html |work= Sydney Morning Herald|publisher= |date= 20 May 2008|accessdate=20 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Keating and Hawke provided a study in contrasts. Hawke was a Rhodes Scholar; Keating left high school early.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, J.,(1996), p.44&lt;/ref&gt; Hawke's enthusiasms were cigars, horse racing and all forms of sport; Keating preferred [[classical architecture]], [[Mahler]] symphonies, and collecting [[British Regency|English Regency]] and French Empire antiques.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, J.,(1996), p.6, p.48&lt;/ref&gt; Hawke was consensus-driven; Keating revelled in aggressive debate. Hawke was a lapsed Protestant; Keating was a practising Catholic. Despite their differences, the two formed an effective political partnership.

According to political commentator Paul Kelly, 'the most influential economic decisions of the 1980s were the floating of the [[Australian Dollar]] and the deregulation of the financial system'.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;Kelly, P., (1992), p.76&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Fraser government had played a part in the process of financial deregulation by commissioning the Campbell report&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, P., (1992), p.78&lt;/ref&gt;{{mdash}}published in 1981{{mdash}}opposition from Fraser himself, the National Party and Treasury Secretary John Stone stalled the deregulation process. When the [[Hawke-Keating Government]] implemented a comprehensive program of financial deregulation and reform, it 'transformed economics and politics in Australia'.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt; The Australian economy became significantly more integrated with the global economy.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt; Both Hawke and Keating have claimed the credit for being the driving force behind the Australian Dollar float.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, J.,(1996), pp.216–217&lt;/ref&gt;

Among other reforms, the Hawke Government dismantled the tariff system,&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, P., (1992), p.665&lt;/ref&gt; privatised state sector industries, ended subsidisation of loss-making industries, and sold off the state-owned [[Commonwealth Bank|Commonwealth Bank of Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, P., (1992), p.672&lt;/ref&gt; The tax system was reformed, with the introduction of fringe benefits tax and a capital gains tax&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, P., (1992), p.175&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– a reform strongly opposed by the Liberal Party at the time, but not reversed when they returned to office. Partially offsetting these imposts upon the business community{{mdash}}the 'main loser' from the 1985 Tax Summit, according to Paul Kelly{{mdash}}was the introduction of full [[dividend imputation]], a reform insisted upon by Keating.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, P., (1992), p.174&lt;/ref&gt;

Hawke benefited greatly from the disarray into which the Liberal opposition fell after the resignation of Fraser. The Liberals were divided between supporters of the dour socially conservative [[John Howard]] and the urbane [[Andrew Peacock]]. The arch-conservative [[Premier of Queensland]], Sir [[Joh Bjelke-Petersen]], also helped Hawke with his &quot;[[Joh for Canberra]]&quot; campaign in 1987, which proved highly damaging for the conservatives. Exploiting these divisions, Hawke led the Labor Party to comfortable election victories in [[Australian federal election, 1984|1984]] and [[Australian federal election, 1987|1987]].

Hawke's Prime Ministership saw considerable friction between himself and the grassroots of the Labor Party, who were unhappy at what they viewed as Hawke's iconoclasm and willingness to cooperate with business interests. All Labor Prime Ministers have at times engendered the hostility of the organisational wing of the party, but none more so than Hawke, who expressed his willingness to cull Labor's &quot;sacred cows&quot;. The [[Socialist Left (Australia)|Socialist Left]] faction, as well as prominent Labor figure [[Barry Jones (Australian politician)|Barry Jones]], offered severe criticism of a number of government decisions. He has also received criticism for his 'confrontationalist style' in siding with the airlines in the [[1989 Australian pilots' strike]].&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, P., (1992), p.544&lt;/ref&gt;

In spite of the criticisms levelled against the Hawke Government, it succeeded in enacting a wide range of social reforms during its time in office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/20943/20010718-0000/www.alp.org.au/about/achievements/index.html |title=Achievements of the Federal Labor Government - 1983-1986 |publisher=Pandora.nla.gov.au |date=2006-08-23 |accessdate=2011-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.library.unisa.edu.au/bhpml/speeches/Prime/policy.pdf] {{Dead link|date=May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deflecting arguments that the Hawke Government had failed as a reform government, [[Neville Wran]], [[John Dawkins]], [[Bill Hayden]], and [[Paul Keating]] made a number of speeches during the Eighties arguing that the Hawke Government had been a recognisably reformist Labor government, drawing attention to Hawke’s achievements as prime minister during his first four or five years in office. Apart from the reintroduction of [[Medibank]] (under the name [[Medicare (Australia)|Medicare]]), these included a doubling of child care places, the introduction of occupational superannuation, a boost in school retention rates, a focus on young people’s job skills, a doubling of subsidised home care services, the elimination of poverty traps in the welfare system, a 50% increase in public housing funds, an increase in the real value of the old-age pension,&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Whitlam, Wran and the Labor tradition: Labor history essays, volume two By Gough Whitlam, Australian Labor Party, New South Wales Branch&lt;/ref&gt; the development of a new youth support program, the re-introduction of six-monthly indexation of single adult unemployment benefits, and significant improvements in social security provisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://john.curtin.edu.au/jcmemlect/wran1986.html |title=Wran/1986 The Great Tradition-Labor Reform from Curtin to Hawke |publisher=John.curtin.edu.au |date= |accessdate=2011-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; As pointed out by John Dawkins, the proportion of total government outlays allocated to families, the sick, single parents, widows, the handicapped, and veterans had been higher under the Hawke Government than under the Whitlam Government.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

A notable success for which the government's response is given considerable credit was [[HIV/AIDS in Australia|Australia's public health campaign]] about [[AIDS]].&lt;ref&gt;For discussion see William Bowtell, ''Australia’s Response to HIV/AIDS 1982–2005'', Lowy Institute for International Policy, May 2005&lt;/ref&gt; In the later years of the Hawke government, Aboriginal affairs saw considerable attention, with an investigation of the idea of a treaty between Aborigines and the government, though this idea was overtaken by events, notably including the [[Mabo v Queensland (No 2) (1992)|Mabo]] court decision.

The Hawke government also made some notable environmental decisions. In its first months in office it stopped the construction of the [[Franklin Dam]], on the [[Franklin River]] in [[Tasmania]],&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, P., (1992), p.528&lt;/ref&gt; responding to a groundswell of protest about the issue. In 1990, a looming tight election saw a tough political operator, [[Graham Richardson]], appointed Environment Minister, whose task it was to attract second-preference votes from the [[Australian Democrats]] and other environmental parties. Richardson claimed this as a major factor in the government's narrow re-election in 1990,&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, G., (1994), pp. 276–277&lt;/ref&gt; Hawke's last triumph.

Richardson felt that the importance of his contribution to Labor's victory would automatically entitle him to the ministerial portfolio of his choice{{mdash}}Transport and Communications.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, G., (1994), p.281&lt;/ref&gt; He was shocked, however, at what he perceived as Hawke's ingratitude in allocating him Social Security instead. He vowed{{mdash}}in a telephone conversation with Peter Barron,&lt;ref name=&quot;Kelly, P., 1992, p.57&quot;/&gt; a former Hawke political staffer{{mdash}}to do 'whatever it takes' to 'get' Hawke.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, G., (1994), p.282&lt;/ref&gt; He immediately transferred his allegiance to Keating and subsequently claimed credit for playing a vital role in Keating's campaign for the leadership as a numbers man.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, G., (1994), p.311&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decline and fall===
[[Image:Latham-Hawke.jpg|thumb|left|Bob Hawke with then Labor leader [[Mark Latham]] unveil a plaque in 2004 to commemorate the centenary of the [[Chris Watson]] Labor government in 1904.]]
The [[late 1980s recession]] and high interest rates saw the government in considerable electoral trouble. Although Keating was the main architect of the government's economic policies, he took advantage of Hawke's declining popularity to plan a leadership challenge. In 1988 Hawke had responded to pressure from Keating to step down by making a secret agreement (the so-called &quot;[[Kirribilli House|Kirribilli]] agreement&quot; or &quot;Kirribilli accord&quot;) to resign in favour of Keating some time after winning the 1990 election.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, P., (1992), p.454&lt;/ref&gt; After Keating made a speech to the [[Canberra Press Gallery|Federal Parliamentary Press Gallery]] that Hawke considered disloyal, Hawke indicated to Keating that he would renege on the agreement.&lt;ref&gt;Hawke (1994), p.501. This was the speech in which Keating described himself as the 'Placido Domingo' of Australian politics.&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1991 Keating responded by resigning from Cabinet and challenging for the Labor Party leadership. Hawke defeated Keating's leadership challenge, but he was clearly a wounded leader.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, J., (1996), p.435&lt;/ref&gt; Hawke had himself sworn in as Treasurer for one day while he decided between the rival claims of [[Ralph Willis]] and [[John Kerin]] for the job, eventually choosing Kerin, who proved to be unequal to the job.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, P., (1992), pp.649–651&lt;/ref&gt;

Hawke's leadership was further damaged as a consequence of the new Liberal leader, Dr [[John Hewson]], releasing [[Fightback!]], a detailed proposal for sweeping economic change, including a [[Goods and Services Tax (Australia)|goods and services tax]] and deep cuts to government spending and personal income tax, in November 1991.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, P., (1992), pp.609–614&lt;/ref&gt; Hawke's response to this challenge was judged to be ineffective,&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, J.,(1996), p.441&lt;/ref&gt; and a rattled Labor Party turned to Keating. At a second challenge, on 20 December 1991, Keating defeated Hawke in a party-room ballot, 56 votes to 51. Hawke resigned from Parliament on 20 February 1992,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/primeministers/hawke/after-office.aspx |title=National Archive of Australia — Australia's Prime Ministers |publisher=Primeministers.naa.gov.au |date=1992-02-20 |accessdate=2011-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; sparking the [[Wills by-election, 1992|1992 Wills by-election]], which was won by independent [[Phil Cleary]] from a record field of 22 candidates.

Hawke apparently had few regrets, although his bitterness towards Keating surfaced in his memoirs. Hawke now claims to have buried his differences and considers Keating a friend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/07/13/2302268.htm |title=Hawke and Keating bury the hatchet&amp;nbsp;– ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation) |publisher=Abc.net.au |date=13 July 2008 |accessdate=25 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1990, Hawke had outstripped Malcolm Fraser to become Australia's second-longest serving Prime Minister. This record has since been overtaken by [[John Howard]]. Hawke remains the Australian Labor Party's longest-serving Prime Minister.

It is also said by a former [[Tony Blair]] staffer that [[UK Labour]] and Blair learnt from the Hawke government in the 1980s on how to govern when they took power in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/how-the-british-came-saw-and-helped-rudd/2007/12/16/1197740090746.html?page=2 |title=How the British came, saw and helped Rudd&amp;nbsp;– National&amp;nbsp;– |publisher=Theage.com.au |date=16 December 2007 |accessdate=25 April 2010 | location=Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life after politics==

After politics, Hawke entered the business world with considerable success. [[Hazel Hawke]], who for the sake of the Labor cause had put up with the open secret of his relationship with his biographer [[Blanche d'Alpuget]] while he was Prime Minister, divorced him, and shortly afterwards he married d'Alpuget. He had little to do with the Labor Party during Keating's leadership. In fact he often criticised the Keating Government publicly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9111648/AUSTRALIA 1994 Year in Review&amp;nbsp;– Australia] [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] online&lt;/ref&gt; After the election of the [[John Howard|Howard]] Liberal government in 1996 he became a close supporter of Opposition Leader [[Kim Beazley]].

In the run up to the [[Australian federal election, 2007|2007 election]], Hawke (at the age of 78) made a considerable personal effort to support the Australian Labor Party's campaign, making speeches at a large number of campaign office openings across Australia. As well as campaigning against [[WorkChoices]], Hawke also attacked [[John Howard|John Howard's]] record as Treasurer, stating &quot;it was the judgement of every economist and international financial institution that it was the restructuring reforms undertaken by my government with the full cooperation of the trade union movement which created the strength of the Australian economy today&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/federalelection2007news/hawke-queries-record-of-man-who-buggered-the-economy/2007/10/24/1192941153265.html |title=Hawke queries record of man who 'buggered' the economy |publisher=The Age |date=24 October 2007 |accessdate=25 April 2010 | location=Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Hawke helped establish the Centre for Muslim and Non-Muslim Understanding at the [[University of South Australia]]. Interfaith dialogue is an important issue for Hawke, who told the ''[[Adelaide Review]]'' that he is &quot;convinced that one of the great potential dangers confronting the world is the lack of understanding in regard to the Muslim world. Fanatics have misrepresented what Islam is. They give a false impression of the essential nature of Islam.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Ward, Amanda | title = World peace and a republic | work = [[Adelaide Review]] | issue = 358 | date = December 2009 | pages = 6–7 | url = http://www.adelaidereview.com.au/archives.php?subaction=showfull&amp;id=1259130386&amp;archive=1261450745&amp;start_from=&amp;ucat=16&amp; | accessdate = 14 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2008, he was made Grand Companion of the [[Order of Logohu]], the highest [[Orders, decorations, and medals of Papua New Guinea|Papua New Guinean honour]] available to non-Papua New Guinean citizens, entitling him to be referred to as &quot;Chief&quot;. In a letter to Bob Hawke, Papua New Guinean Prime Minister Sir [[Michael Somare]] informed him that he was being honoured for his &quot;support for Papua New Guinea [...] from the time you assisted in the development of our trade union movement, and basic workplace conditions, to the strong support you gave us during your term as Prime Minister of Australia&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chief&quot;&gt;[http://www.solomontimes.com/news.aspx?nwID=3346 &quot;Former Australian Prime Minister Named PNG Chief&quot;], ''Solomon Times'', 8 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Each arrow overshot his head by Elmer Boyd Smith.jpg|thumb|right|&quot;Each arrow overshot his head&quot; (1902) by Elmer Boyd Smith.]]
'''Baldr''' (also '''Balder''', '''Baldur''') is a [[deity|god]] in [[Norse mythology]].

In the 12th century, Danish accounts by [[Saxo Grammaticus]] and other Danish Latin chroniclers recorded a [[Euhemerus|euhemerized]] account of his story. Compiled in [[Iceland]] in the 13th century, but based on much older [[Old Norse poetry]], the [[Poetic Edda]] and the [[Prose Edda]] contain numerous references to the death of Baldr as both a great tragedy to the [[Æsir]] and a harbinger of [[Ragnarök]].

According to ''[[Gylfaginning]]'', a book of [[Snorri Sturluson]]'s Prose Edda, Baldr's wife is [[Nanna (Norse deity)|Nanna]] and their son is [[Forseti]]. In ''Gylfaginning'', Snorri relates that Baldr had the greatest ship ever built, named [[Hringhorni]], and that there is no place more beautiful than his hall, [[Breidablik]].

==Name==
[[Grimm]] in his ''[[Deutsche Mythologie|Teutonic Mythology]]'' (chapter 11) identifies Old Norse ''Baldr'' with the Old High German given name ''Paltar'', and with Old English ''bealdor, baldor'' &quot;lord, prince, king&quot; (used always with a genitive plural, as in ''gumena baldor'' &quot;lord of men&quot;, ''wigena baldor'' &quot;lord of warriors&quot;, etc.) Old Norse shows this usage of the word as a honorific in a few cases, as in ''baldur î brynju'' ([[Saemundar Edda|Sæm.]] 272b) and ''herbaldr'' (Sæm. 218b), both epithets of heroes in general.

Grimm traces the etymology of the name to ''*balþoz'', whence Gothic ''balþs'', Old Engish ''bald'', Old High German ''pald'', all meaning &quot;bold, brave, ''audax''&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;''Baldrs'' would in strictness appear to have no connexion with the Goth. ''balþs'' (bold, audax), nor ''Paltar'' with the OHG. ''pald'', nor ''Baldr'' with the ON. ''ballr'' 'dangerous, dire'. As a rule, the Gothic ''ld'' is represented by ON. ''ld'' and OHG. ''lt'': the Gothic ''lþ'' by ON. ''ll'' and OHG. ''ld''.   But the OS. and AS. have ''ld'' in both cases, and even in Gothic, ON. and OHG. a root will sometimes appear in both forms in the same language;  so that a close connexion between ''balþs'' and ''Baldrs'', ''pald'' and Paltar, is possible after all.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

But the interpretation of Baldr as &quot;the brave god&quot; may be secondary. Lithuanian ''[[:wikt:baltas|baltas]]'', Latvian ''[[:wikt:balts|balts]]'' signify &quot;the white, the good&quot;, and Grimm speculates that the name may originate as a Baltic loan into [[Common Germanic]].
In Anglo-Saxon tradition, the son of [[Woden]] is called not ''Bealdor'' but ''Bældæg, Beldeg'', which shows association with &quot;day&quot;, possibly with [[Dagr|Day]] personified as a deity which, Grimm points out, would agree with the meaning &quot;shining one, white one, a god&quot; derived from the meaning of Baltic ''baltas'', further adducing Slavic ''[[Belobog]]'' and German ''[[Berhta]]''.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;''Bæl-dæg'' itself is white-god, light-god, he that shines as sky and light and day, the kindly ''Bièlbôgh, Bèlbôgh'' of the Slav system. It is in perfect accord with this explanation of ''Bæl-dæg'', that the AS. tale of ancestry assigns to him a son Brond, of whom the Edda is silent, ''brond, brand'', ON. ''brandr'' (fire brand or blade of a sword), signifying ''jubar, fax, titio''. Bældæg therefore, as regards his name, would agree with ''Berhta'', the bright goddess.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Merseburg Incantation===
One of the two [[Merseburg Incantations]] names Balder, and it also mentions a figure named ''Phol''. It has been theorized that Phol may therefore be another name for Baldr.&lt;ref name=CALVIN&gt;Calvin, Thomas. 'An Anthology of German Literature', D. C. Heath &amp; co. ASIN: B0008BTK3E,B00089RS3K.

===''Poetic Edda''===
[[Image:Mímer and Balder Consulting the Norns (1821-1822) by H. E. Freund.jpg|thumb|&quot;Mímer and Balder Consulting the Norns&quot; (1821-1822) by [[H. E. Freund]].]]
In the Poetic Edda the tale of Baldr's death is referred to rather than recounted at length. Among the visions which the [[Völva]] sees and describes in the prophecy known as the ''[[Völuspá]]'' is one of the fatal [[Mistletoe|mistletoe]], the birth of [[Váli (son of Odin)|Váli]] and the weeping of [[Frigg]] (stanzas 31-33).  Yet looking far into the future the Völva sees a brighter vision of a new world, when both Höðr and Baldr will come back (stanza 62). The Eddic poem ''[[Baldr's Dreams]]'' mentions that Baldr has bad dreams which the gods then discuss. [[Odin]] rides to Hel and awakens a seeress, who tells him Höðr will kill Baldr but Vali will avenge him (stanzas 9, 11).

===''Prose Edda''===
[[Image:SÁM 66, 75v, death of Baldr.jpg|thumb|right|thumb|Baldr's death is portrayed in this illustration from an 18th century [[Iceland]]ic manuscript.]]

In ''Gylfaginning'', Baldur is described as follows:

{|
|
:''Annar sonur Óðins er Baldur, og er frá honum gott að segja. Hann er svá fagr álitum ok bjartr svá at lýsir af honum, ok eitt gras er svá hvítt at jafnat er til Baldrs brár. Þat er allra grasa hvítast, ok þar eptir máttu marka fegrð hans bæði á hár og á líki. Hann er vitrastr ása ok fegrst talaðr ok líknsamastr. En sú náttúra fylgir honum at engi má haldask dómr hans. Hann býr þar sem heita Breiðablik, þat er á himni. Í þeim stað má ekki vera óhreint[.]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hi.is/~eybjorn/gg/ggupar17.html An online edition of the Old Norse text.]&lt;/ref&gt;
|
:The second son of Odin is Baldur, and good things are to be said of him. He is best, and all praise him; he is so fair of feature, and so bright, that light shines from him. [[Matricaria perforata|A certain herb]] is so white that it is likened to Baldr's brow; of all grasses it is whitest, and by it thou mayest judge his fairness, both in hair and in body. He is the wisest of the Æsir, and the fairest-spoken and most gracious; and that quality attends him, that none may gainsay his judgments. He dwells in the place called Breidablik, which is in heaven; in that place may nothing unclean be[.] — ''Brodeur's translation''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.northvegr.org/lore/prose/033036.php Gylfaginning, XXII]&lt;/ref&gt;
|
|}

Apart from this description Baldr is known primarily for the story of his death. His death is seen as the first in the chain of events which will ultimately lead to the destruction of the gods at [[Ragnarök]]. Baldr will be reborn in the new world, according to ''[[Völuspá]]''.

He had a dream of his own death and his mother had the same dreams. Since dreams were usually prophetic, this depressed him, so his mother [[Frigg]] made every object on earth [[vow]] never to hurt Baldr. All objects made this vow except [[mistletoe]].&lt;ref name=&quot;The Children of Odin&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=The Children of Odin |first=Padraic |last=Colum |publisher=Aladdin Paperbacks |year=1920 |isbn=0689868855}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frigg had thought it too unimportant and nonthreatening to bother asking it to make the vow (alternatively, it seemed too young to swear).

[[Image:Odin's last words to Baldr.jpg|thumb|left|&quot;Odin's last words to Baldr&quot; (1908) by W. G. Collingwood.]]

When [[Loki]], the mischief-maker, heard of this, he made a magical spear from this plant (in some later versions, an arrow). He hurried to the place where the gods were indulging in their new pastime of hurling objects at Baldr, which would bounce off without harming him. Loki gave the spear to Baldr's brother, the blind god [[Höðr]], who then inadvertently killed his brother with it (other versions suggest that Loki guided the arrow himself). For this act, Odin and the giantess [[Rindr]] gave birth to [[Váli (son of Odin)|Váli]] who grew to adulthood within a day and slew Höðr.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.northvegr.org/lore/prose/069072.php Gylfaginning, XLIX]&lt;/ref&gt;

Baldr was ceremonially burnt upon his ship, [[Hringhorni]], the largest of all ships. As he was carried to the ship, Odin whispered in his ear. This was to be a key riddle asked by Odin (in disguise) of the giant [[Vafthrudnir]] (and which was, of course, unanswerable) in the poem ''[[Vafthrudnismal]]''. The riddle also appears in the riddles of [[Gestumblindi]] in ''[[Hervarar saga]]''.&lt;ref&gt;According to Carolyne Larrington in her translation of the ''Poetic Edda'' it is assumed that what Odin whispered in Baldr's ear was a promise of resurrection.&lt;/ref&gt;

The dwarf [[Litr]] was kicked by [[Thor]] into the funeral fire and burnt alive. Nanna, Baldr's wife, also threw herself on the funeral fire to await Ragnarök when she would be reunited with her husband (alternatively, she died of grief). Baldr's horse with all its trappings was also burned on the pyre. The ship was set to sea by [[Hyrrokin]], a [[giantess]], who came riding on a wolf and gave the ship such a push that fire flashed from the rollers and all the earth shook.
[[Image:Balder the Good by Jacques Reich.jpg|thumb|right|&quot;Balder the Good&quot; by Jacques Reich.]]

Upon Frigg's entreaties, delivered through the messenger [[Hermóðr|Hermod]], [[Hel (goddess)|Hel]] promised to release Baldr from the underworld if all objects alive and dead would weep for him. And all did, except a [[giantess]], [[Þökk]], who refused to mourn the slain god. And thus Baldr had to remain in the underworld, not to emerge until after Ragnarök, when he and his brother Höðr would be reconciled and rule the new earth together with Thor's sons.

When the gods discovered that the [[giantess]] Þökk had been [[Loki]] in disguise, they hunted him down and bound him to three rocks. Then they tied a serpent above him, the venom of which dripped onto his face. His wife [[Sigyn]] gathered the venom in a bowl, but from time to time she had to turn away to empty it, at which point the poison would drip onto Loki, who writhed in pain, thus causing earthquakes. He would free himself, however, in time to attack the gods at Ragnarök.

===''Gesta Danorum''===
Writing at about the end of the 12th century, the [[Denmark|Danish]] historian [[Saxo Grammaticus]] tells the story of Baldr (recorded as ''Balderus'') in a form which professes to be historical.  According to him, Balderus and '''Høtherus''' were rival suitors for the hand of Nanna, daughter of Gewar, King of [[Norway]]. Now Balderus was a demigod and common [[steel]] could not wound his sacred body. The two rivals encountered each other in a terrific battle. Though Odin and Thor and the rest of the gods fought for Balderus, he was defeated and fled away, and Høtherus married the princess.

Nevertheless Balderus took heart of grace and again met Høtherus in a stricken field. But he fared even worse than before. Høtherus dealt him a deadly wound with a [[magic sword]], named [[Mistilteinn|Mistletoe]],&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, H.R. Ellis, ''Gods and Myths of Northern Europe'', Pelican Books 1964&lt;/ref&gt; which he had received from [[Miming]], the satyr of the woods; after lingering three days in pain Balderus died of his injury and was buried with royal honours in a barrow.
[[Image:Balder.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Baldrs draumar]]'' (1893).]]

===''Chronicon Lethrense'' and ''Annales Lundenses''===
There are also two lesser known Danish Latin chronicles, the ''[[Chronicon Lethrense]]'' and the ''[[Annales Lundenses]]'' of which the latter is included in the former. These two sources provide a second euhemerized account of Höðr's slaying of Baldr.

It relates that Hother was the king of the [[Saxons]] and son of [[Hothbrodd|Hothbrod]] and the daughter of [[Hadding]]. Hother first slew Othen's (i.e. Odin) son Balder in battle and then chased Othen and Thor. Finally, Othen's son Both killed Hother. Hother, Balder, Othen and Thor were incorrectly considered to be gods.

===Utrecht Inscription===
A Latin votive inscription from Utrecht, from the 3rd or 4th century C.E., has been theorized as containing the dative form ''Baldruo'',&lt;ref name=&quot;Die germanischen Götternamen der antiken Inschriften&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Die germanischen Götternamen der antiken Inschriften |first=Siegfried |last=Gutenbrunner |publisher=Max Niemeyer Verlag |year=1936 |isbn=}}, p. 210 &amp; pp. 218-20.&lt;/ref&gt; pointing to a Latin nominative singular *''Baldruus'', which some have identified with the Norse/Germanic god,&lt;ref name=&quot;Heathen Gods in Old English Literature&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Heathen Gods in Old English Literature |first=Richard |last=North |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |year=1997 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=X_LKUIqNvPQC&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=Heathen+Gods+in+Old+English+Literature&amp;lr=&amp;ei=g2DTSqn6CIiWMPrOkIsO#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |isbn=0521551838}}, p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt; although both the reading and this interpretation have been questioned.&lt;ref name=&quot;Van Ægir tot Ymir: personages en thema's uit de Germaanse en Noordse mythologie&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Van Ægir tot Ymir: personages en thema's uit de Germaanse en Noordse mythologie |first=Pamela &amp; Quak, Arend |last=Vermeyden |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2000 |isbn=906168661X}}, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;''Balder'', in Reallexikon der Germanischen Altertumskunde&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=''Balder'', in Reallexikon der Germanischen Altertumskunde |first=Karl |last=Helm |publisher=Walter de Gruyter GmbH &amp; Co KG |year=1976 |isbn=}}, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are few old place names in Scandinavia that contain the name ''Baldr''. The most certain and notable one is the (former) parish name [[Balleshol]] in Hedmark county, Norway: &quot;a Balldrshole&quot; 1356 (where the last element is ''hóll'' m &quot;mound; small hill&quot;). Others may be (in [[North Germanic languages|Norse]] forms) ''Baldrsberg'' in Vestfold county, ''Baldrsheimr'' in Hordaland county ''Baldrsnes'' in Sør-Trøndelag county — and (very uncertain) the fjord and municipality [[Balsfjord]] in Troms county.

In [[Copenhagen]], there is also a Baldersgade, or &quot;Balder's Street.&quot; A street in downtown [[Reykjavik]] is called Baldursgata (Baldur's Street).

There is also a 1998 [[Dungeons and Dragons]] computer RPG game called [[Baldur's Gate]]. Baldur's Gate is a city in the [[Forgotten Realms]], and the founder of the city was called Balduran.

In [[Belgium]], the name ''Balder'' is also used in dialect for a village called [[Berlaar]] and in another village ([[Tielen]]), the ''Balderij'' is a street and a swampy area next to it.

[[Baldur, Manitoba]] is a village in southern Manitoba, Canada.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[Norse mythology]], '''Breiðablik'''&lt;ref&gt;The name can be Anglicized as '''Breidablik''', '''Breithablik''' or '''Breidhablik'''.&lt;/ref&gt; (''Broad-gleaming'') is the home of [[Baldr]]. It is briefly described in [[Snorri Sturluson]]'s ''Gylfaginning'' as one of the halls of Asgard:

:&quot;Then there is also in that place the abode called Breidablik, and there is not in heaven a fairer dwelling.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Gylfaginning'' XVII, Brodeur's translation.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in the work, when Snorri describes Baldr, he gives a longer description, citing ''[[Grímnismál]]'', though he does not name the poem:

:&quot;He dwells in the place called Breidablik, which is in heaven; in that place may nothing unclean be, even as is said here:

::Breidablik 't is called, | where Baldr has
:::A hall made for himself:
::In that land | where I know lie
:::Fewest baneful [[runes]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Gylfaginning'' XXII, Brodeur's translation. The strophe is ''Grímnismál'' 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Breiðablik is not otherwise mentioned in the Eddic sources.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Freya and Heimdall by Blommer.jpg|thumb|Heimdall returns Brisingamen to Freyja]]
{{Cleanup|date=September 2008}}
In [[Norse mythology]], '''''Brísingamen''''' (from [[Old Norse]] ''brisinga'' &quot;flaming, glowing&quot; and  ''men'' &quot;jewelery, ornament&quot;)&lt;ref&gt;Onsell, Birgitta. 'V&amp;auml;rldens vackraste smycke.' in ''Jordens moder i Norden.'' Stockholm: Carlssons, 1994. p. 111-2.&lt;/ref&gt; is the [[necklace]] of the goddess [[Freyja]].&lt;ref&gt;The Poetic Edda, Henry A. Bellows, transl. Princeton University Press, 1936. p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attestations==
===''Beowulf''===
Brísingamen is referred to in the Anglo-Saxon epic ''[[Beowulf]]'' as ''Brosinga mene''. The brief mention in ''Beowulf'' is as follows (trans. by Howell Chickering, 1977):

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''...since Hama bore off&lt;br&gt;to the shining city the Brosings' necklace, &lt;br&gt;Gem-figured filigree. He gained the hatred &lt;br&gt;Of Eormanric the Goth, chose eternal reward.''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This seems to confuse two different stories as the ''Beowulf''  poet is clearly referring to the ''[[Dietrich Cycle]]''. The ''[[Þiðrekssaga]]'' tells that the warrior [[Heimir|Heime]] (''Hama'' in Old English) takes sides against [[Eormanric]], king of the [[Goths]], and has to flee his kingdom after robbing him; later in life, Hama enters a monastery and gives them all his stolen treasure. However, this saga makes no mention of the great necklace. Possibly the ''Beowulf'' poet was confused, or invented the addition of the necklace to give him an excuse to drag in a mention of Eormanric. In any case, the necklace given to Beowulf in the story is not the Brísingamen itself; it's only being compared to it.

===''Poetic Edda''===
In the poem ''[[Þrymskviða]]'' of the ''[[Poetic Edda]]'', [[Thrymr]], the King of the Jötuns, steals [[Thor]]'s [[Mjolnir]]. Freyja lends [[Loki]] her falcon cloak to search for it; but upon returning, Loki tells Freyja that Thrymr has hidden the hammer and demanded to marry her in return. Freyja is so wrathful that all the [[Æsir]]’s halls beneath her are shaken and the necklace Brísingamen breaks off from her neck. Later Thor borrows Brísingamen when he dresses up as Freyja to go to the wedding at [[Jötunheim]].

This myth is also recorded in a Swedish folksong called the ''Thor song'' (18th Century), where Freyja is called Miss Frojenborg, &quot;den väna solen&quot; (the fair sun).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.drengskap.com/gimle/modules/articles/print.php?id=42 The Thor song (Swedish)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Prose Edda''===
''[[Húsdrápa]]'', a [[skaldic poem]] partially preserved in the ''[[Prose Edda]]'', relates the story of the theft of Brísingamen by [[Loki]]. One day when Freyja wakes up and finds Brísingamen missing, she enlists the help of [[Heimdall]] to help her search for it. Eventually they find the thief, who turns out to be [[Loki]] who has transformed himself into a seal. Heimdall turns into a seal as well and fights Loki. After a lengthy battle at [[Singasteinn]], Heimdall wins and returns Brísingamen to Freyja.

[[Snorri Sturluson]] quoted this old poem in ''[[Skáldskaparmál]]'', saying that because of this legend Heimdall is called &quot;Seeker of Freyja's Necklace&quot; (''Skáldskaparmál'', section 8) and Loki is called &quot;Thief of Brísingamen&quot; (''Skáldskaparmál'', section 16). A similar story appears in the later ''Sörla þáttr'', where Heimdall does not appear.

===''Sörla þáttr''===
[[Sörla þáttr]] is a short story in the later and extended version of the ''[[Saga of Olaf Tryggvason]]''&lt;ref&gt;The ''[[Younger Edda]]''. [[Rasmus B. Anderson]] transl. (1897) Chicago: Scott, Foresman &amp; Co. (1901).&lt;/ref&gt; in the manuscript of the ''[[Flateyjarbók]]'', which was written and compiled by two [[Christian]] [[priest]]s, Jon Thordson and Magnus Thorhalson, in late 14th century.&lt;ref name=RAMUS&gt;[[Rasmus B. Anderson]], Introduction to the ''[[Flateyjarbók|The Flatey Book]]''. Norræna Society, London (1908). ''&quot;The priest Jon Thordson wrote the story of Erik Vidforle and both the Olaf Sagas; but the priest Magnus Thorhalson wrote what follows and also what goes before, and revised the whole, thus dedicating the work: &quot;May God Almighty and the Virgin Mary bless both the one that wrote and the one that dictated!&quot;''&lt;/ref&gt; In the end of the story, the arrival of [[Christianity]] dissolves the old curse that traditionally was to endure until [[Ragnarök]].

&quot;Freyja was a human in Asia and was the favorite [[concubine]] of Odin, King of Asialand. When this woman wanted to buy a golden necklace (no name given) forged by four dwarves (named Dvalinn, Alfrik, Berling, and Grer), she offered them gold and silver but they replied that they would only sell it to her if she would lie a night by each of them. She came home afterward with the necklace and kept silent as if nothing happened. But a man called Loki somehow knew it, and came to tell Odin. King Odin commanded Loki to steal the necklace, so Loki turned into a fly to sneak into Freyja's bower and stole it. When Freyja found her necklace missing, she came to ask king Odin. In exchange for it, Odin ordered her to make two kings, each served by twenty kings, fight forever unless some [[Baptism|christened]] men so brave would dare to enter the battle and slay them. She said yes, and got that necklace back. Under the spell, king Högni and king Heðinn battled for one hundred and forty-three years, as soon as they fell down they had to stand up again and fight on. But in the end, the Christian lord [[Olaf Tryggvason]], who has a great fate and luck, arrived with his christened men, and whoever slain by a Christian would stay dead. Thus the pagan curse was finally dissolved by the arrival of Christianity. After that, the noble man, king Olaf, went back to his realm.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;This short story is also known as &quot;The Saga of Högni and Hedinn&quot;. English translation can be found at [http://www.northvegr.org/lore/love/00401.php Northvegr: Three Northern Love Stories and Other Tales.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The battle of Högni and Heðinn is recorded in several medieval sources, including the [[skaldic poem]] ''[[Ragnarsdrápa]]'', ''Skáldskaparmál'' (section 49), and ''[[Gesta Danorum]]'': king Högni's daughter, Hildr, is kidnapped by king Heðinn. When Högni comes to fight Heðinn on an island, Hildr comes to offer her father a necklace on behalf of Heðinn for peace; but the two kings still battle, and [[Hildr]] resurrects the fallen to make them fight until [[Ragnarök]].&lt;ref name=BRODEURPROSE&gt; Brodeur, Arthur Gilchrist.

''The Prose Edda of Snorri Sturlson'' (1916) Transcribed by Alfta Lothursdottir and available online via the [[Northvegr Foundation]] here:[http://northvegr.org/lore/prose/index.php]&lt;/ref&gt; None of these earlier sources mentions Freyja or king Olaf Tryggvason, the historical figure who [[christianize]]d Norway and Iceland in the 10th Century.

==Archaeological record==
[[Image:Freyja in silver.jpg|thumb|right|120px|The pendant, in the [[Swedish Museum of National Antiquities]] in [[Stockholm]].]]
C. 1000, a pagan priestess ([[Völva]]) was buried with considerable splendour in Hagebyhöga in [[Östergötland]]. In addition to being buried with her [[wand]], she had received great riches which included horses, a wagon and an Arabian bronze pitcher. There was also a silver pendant which represents a woman with a broad necklace around her neck. This kind of necklace was only worn by the most prominent women during the Iron Age and some have interpreted it as [[Freyja]]'s favourite necklace Brísingamen. The pendant may represent Freyja herself.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harrison58&quot;&gt;Harrison, D. &amp; Svensson, K. (2007). ''Vikingaliv''. Fälth &amp; Hässler, Värnamo. ISBN 978-91-27-35725-9 p.58&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern influence==
[[Alan Garner]] wrote a children's [[fantasy]] novel called ''[[The Weirdstone of Brisingamen]]'' about an enchanted teardrop bracelet.

[[Christopher Paolini]] derives the ancient word &quot;[[Brisingr]]&quot; from Brísingamen in his [[Inheritance series]].

[[Black Phoenix Alchemy Lab]] has a perfumed oil scent named Brisingamen.

Freyja's necklace Brisingamen features prominently in [[Betsy Tobin]]'s novel Iceland, where the necklace is seen to have significant protective powers.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[mathematics]], the '''Borsuk–Ulam theorem''', named after [[Stanisław Ulam]] and [[Karol Borsuk]], states that every [[continuous function]] from an [[n-sphere|''n''-sphere]] into [[Euclidean space|Euclidean ''n''-space]] maps some pair of [[antipodal point]]s to the same point.
(Two points on a sphere are called antipodal if they are in exactly opposite directions from the sphere's center.)

The case ''n'' = 2 is often illustrated by saying that at any moment there is always a pair of antipodal points on the [[Earth]]'s surface with equal temperatures and equal barometric pressures. This assumes that temperature and barometric pressure vary continuously.

The Borsuk–Ulam theorem was first conjectured by Ulam, and was proved by Borsuk in 1933.

There is an elementary proof{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} that the Borsuk–Ulam theorem implies the [[Brouwer fixed point theorem]].

A stronger statement related to Borsuk–Ulam theorem is that every antipode-preserving map

:&lt;math&gt;f:\mathbb{S}^n\to\mathbb{S}^n&lt;/math&gt;

has odd [[degree of a mapping|degree]].

== Corollaries==
* No subset of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is [[homeomorphic]] to '''S'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.
* The [[Lusternik–Schnirelmann theorem]]: If the [[sphere]] '''S'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is covered by ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 open sets, then one of these sets contains a pair (''x'',&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;''x'') of antipodal points. (this is equivalent to the Borsuk–Ulam theorem)
* The [[Ham sandwich theorem]]: For any [[Compact space|compact]] sets &lt;math&gt;A_1,\ldots, A_n&lt;/math&gt; in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; we can always find a hyperplane dividing each of them into two subsets of equal measure).

[[Image:Idunn and Bragi by Blommer.jpg|right|thumb|Bragi is shown with a harp and accompanied by his wife [[Iðunn]] in this 19th century painting by [[Nils Blommér]].]]
'''Bragi''' is the [[skald]]ic god of [[poetry]] in [[Norse mythology]].

==Etymology==
''Bragi'' is generally associated with ''bragr'', the Norse word for [[poetry]].  The name of the god may have been derived from ''bragr'', or the term ''bragr'' may have been formed to describe 'what Bragi does'. A connection between the name Bragi and English ''brego'' 'chieftain' has been suggested but is generally now discounted. A connection between Bragi and the ''bragarfull'' 'promise cup' is sometimes suggested, as  ''bragafull'', an alternate form of the word, might be translated as 'Bragi's cup'. See '''[[Bragarfull]]'''.

==Attestations==
[[Image:Bragi and Iðunn by Frølich.jpg|thumb|Bragi, holding a harp, sings before his wife Iðunn (1895) by [[Lorenz Frølich]].]]
[[Image:Bragi by Wahlbom.jpg|thumb|&quot;Bragi&quot; by [[Carl Wahlbom]] (1810-1858).]]
[[Image:Loki taunts Bragi.jpg|thumb|&quot;Loki Taunts Bragi&quot; (1908) by [[W. G. Collingwood]].]]
[[Snorri Sturluson]] writes in the ''[[Gylfaginning]]'' after describing [[Odin]], [[Thor]], and [[Baldr]]:
{{quote|One is called Bragi: he is renowned for wisdom, and most of all for fluency of speech and skill with words. He knows most of skaldship, and after him skaldship is called ''bragr'', and from his name that one is called ''bragr''-man or -woman, who possesses eloquence surpassing others, of women or of men. His wife is [[Iðunn]].}}

In ''[[Skáldskaparmál]]'' Snorri writes:
{{quote|How should one periphrase Bragi? By calling him ''husband of Iðunn'', ''first maker of poetry'', and ''the long-bearded god'' (after his name, a man who has a great beard is called Beard-Bragi), and ''son of Odin''.}}

That Bragi is Odin's son is clearly mentioned only here and in some versions of a list of the sons of Odin (see '''[[Sons of Odin]]'''). But &quot;wish-son&quot; in stanza 16 of the ''[[Lokasenna]]'' could mean &quot;Odin's son&quot; and is translated by Hollander as ''Odin's kin''. Bragi's mother is never named. If Bragi's mother is [[Frigg]], then Frigg is somewhat dismissive of Bragi in the ''Lokasenna'' in stanza 27 when Frigg complains that if she had a son in [[Ægir]]'s hall as brave as [[Baldr]] then [[Loki]] would have to fight for his life.

In that poem Bragi at first forbids Loki to enter the hall but is overruled by Odin. Loki then gives a greeting to all gods and goddesses who are in the hall save to Bragi. Bragi generously offers his sword, horse, and an arm ring as peace gift but Loki only responds by accusing Bragi of cowardice, of being the most afraid to fight of any of the [[Æsir]] and [[Elves]] within the hall. Bragi responds that if they were outside the hall, he would have Loki's head, but Loki only repeats the accusation. When Bragi's wife Iðunn attempts to calm Bragi, Loki accuses her of embracing her brother's slayer, a reference to matters that have not survived. It may be that Bragi had slain Iðunn's brother.

A passage in the ''Poetic Edda'' poem ''[[Sigrdrífumál]]'' describes runes being graven on the sun, on the ear of one of the sun-horses and on the hoofs of the other, on [[Sleipnir]]'s teeth, on bear's paw, on eagle's beak, on wolf's claw, and on several other things including on Bragi's tongue. Then the runes are shaved off and the shavings are mixed with mead and sent abroad so that Æsir have some, Elves have some, [[Vanir]] have some, and Men have some, these being beech runes and birth runes, ale runes, and magic runes. The meaning of this is obscure.

The first part of Snorri Sturluson's ''[[Skáldskaparmál]]'' is a dialogue between [[Ægir]] and Bragi about the nature of poetry, particularly skaldic poetry. Bragi tells the origin of the mead of poetry from the blood of [[Kvasir]] and how Odin obtained this mead. He then goes on to discuss various poetic metaphors known as ''[[kenning]]s''.

Snorri Sturluson clearly distinguishes the god Bragi from the mortal skald Bragi Boddason whom he often mentions separately. Bragi Boddason is discussed below. The appearance of Bragi in the ''Lokasenna'' indicates that if these two Bragis were originally the same, they have become separated for that author also, or that chronology has become very muddled and Bragi Boddason has been relocated to mythological time. Compare the appearance of the [[Wales|Welsh]] [[Taliesin]] in the second branch of the [[Mabinogion|Mabinogi]]. Legendary chronology sometimes does become muddled. Whether Bragi the god originally arose as a deified version of Bragi Boddason was much debated in the 19th century, especially by the [[Germany|German]] scholars Eugen Mogk and Sophus Bugge. The debate remains undecided.

In the poem ''[[Eiríksmál]]'' Odin, in [[Valhalla]], hears the coming of the dead [[Norway|Norwegian]] king [[Eric Bloodaxe]] and his host, and bids the heroes [[Sigmund]] and [[Sinfjötli]] rise to greet him. Bragi is then mentioned, questioning how Odin knows that it is Eric and why Odin has let such a king die. In the poem ''[[Hákonarmál]]'', Hákon the Good is taken to Valhalla by the [[valkyrie]] [[Göndul]] and Odin sends [[Hermóðr]] and Bragi to greet him. In these poems Bragi could be either a god or a dead hero in Valhalla. Attempting to decide is further confused because ''Hermóðr'' also seems to be sometimes the name of a god and sometimes the name of a hero. That Bragi was also the first to speak to Loki in the ''Lokasenna'' as Loki attempted to enter the hall might be a parallel. It might have been useful and customary that a man of great eloquence and versed in poetry should greet those entering a hall.

==Skalds named Bragi==
===Bragi Boddason===
{{main|Bragi Boddason}}
In the ''Prose Edda'' Snorri Sturluson quotes many stanzas attributed to '''Bragi Boddason''' the old (''Bragi Boddason inn gamli''), a court poet who served several Swedish kings, [[Ragnar Lodbrok]], [[Östen Beli]] and [[Björn at Hauge]] who reigned in the first half of the 9th century. This Bragi was reckoned as the first skaldic poet, and was certainly the earliest skaldic poet then remembered by name whose verse survived in memory.

Snorri especially quotes passages from Bragi's ''[[Ragnarsdrápa]]'', a poem supposedly composed in honor of the famous legendary Viking [[Ragnar Lodbrok|Ragnar Lodbrók]] ('Hairy-breeches') describing the images on a decorated shield which Ragnar had given to Bragi. The images included Thor's fishing for [[Jörmungandr]], [[Gefjun]]'s ploughing of [[Zealand (Denmark)|Zealand]] from the soil of Sweden, the attack of [[Hamdir and Sorli]] against King [[Ermanaric|Jörmunrekk]], and the never-ending battle between [[Hedin and Högni]].

===Bragi son of Hálfdan the Old===
'''Bragi son of Hálfdan the Old''' is mentioned only in the ''Skjáldskaparmál''. This Bragi is the sixth of the second of two groups of nine sons fathered by King Hálfdan the Old on Alvig the Wise, daughter of King Eymund of [[Novgorod|Hólmgard]]. This second group of sons are all eponymous ancestors of legendary families of the north. Snorri says:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Bragi, from whom the Bragnings are sprung (that is the race of Hálfdan the Generous).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Of the Bragnings as a race and of Hálfdan the Generous nothing else is known. However, ''Bragning'' is often, like some others of these dynastic names, used in poetry as a general word for 'king' or 'ruler'.

===Bragi Högnason===
In the eddic poem ''[[Helgakviða Hundingsbana II]]'', '''Bragi Högnason''', his brother Dag, and his sister Sigrún were children of [[Högne]], the king of [[East Götaland]]. The poem relates how [[Sigmund]]'s son [[Helgi Hundingsbane]] agreed to take Sigrún daughter of Högni as his wife against her unwilling betrothal to Hodbrodd son of [[Granmar]] the king of [[Södermanland]]. In the subsequent battle of Frekastein (probably one of the 300 [[hill fort]]s of Södermanland, as ''stein'' meant &quot;hill fort&quot;) against Högni and Grammar, all the chieftains on Granmar's side are slain, including Bragi, except for Bragi's brother Dag.

''' Blaise Pascal''' ({{IPA-fr|blɛz paskal}}; June 19, 1623 – August 19, 1662), was a [[French people|French]] [[mathematician]], [[physicist]], [[inventor]], [[writer]] and [[Catholic]] [[philosopher]]. He was a [[child prodigy]] who was educated by his father, a Tax Collector in [[Rouen]].  Pascal's earliest work was in the natural and applied [[science]]s where he made important contributions to the study of [[fluid]]s, and clarified the concepts of [[pressure]] and [[vacuum]] by generalizing the work of [[Evangelista Torricelli]]. Pascal also wrote in defense of the [[scientific method]].

In 1642, while still a teenager, he started some pioneering work on calculating machines, and after three years of effort and 50 prototypes&lt;ref&gt;[http://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/La_Machine_d%E2%80%99arithm%C3%A9tique (fr) La Machine d’arithmétique, Blaise Pascal], Wikisource&lt;/ref&gt; he invented the [[mechanical calculator]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|language=fr|title=Histoire des instruments et machines à calculer, trois siècles de mécanique pensante 1642-1942|first=Jean|last=Marguin|year=1994|publisher=Hermann|isbn=978-2-7056-6166-3|page=48}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|language=fr|title=Le calcul simplifié|first=Maurice|last=d'Ocagne|year=1893|publisher=Gauthier-Villars et fils|page=245|url=http://cnum.cnam.fr/CGI/fpage.cgi?8KU54-2.5/248/150/369/363/369}}&lt;/ref&gt; He built twenty of these machines (called the [[Pascaline]]) in the following ten years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|language=fr|title=Les machines arithmétiques de Blaise Pascal|first=Guy|last=Mourlevat|year=1988|publisher=La Française d'Edition et d'Imprimerie|location=Clermont-Ferrand|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pascal was a mathematician of the first order. He helped create two major new areas of research. He wrote a significant treatise on the subject of [[projective geometry]] at the age of sixteen, and later corresponded with [[Pierre de Fermat]] on [[probability theory]], strongly influencing the development of modern [[economics]] and [[social sciences|social science]]. Following [[Galileo]] and Torricelli, in 1646 he refuted [[Aristotle|Aristotle's]] followers who insisted that [[Vacuum#Historical interpretation|nature abhors a vacuum]].  His results caused many disputes before being accepted.

In 1646, he and his sister Jacqueline identified with the religious movement within [[Catholicism]] known by its detractors as [[Jansenism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11511a.htm |title=Blaise Pascal |accessdate=2009-02-23 |work=Catholic Encyclopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His father died in 1651.  Following a [[mysticism|mystical]] experience in late 1654, he had his &quot;second conversion&quot;, abandoned his scientific work, and devoted himself to philosophy and [[theology]]. His two most famous works date from this period: the ''[[Lettres provinciales]]'' and the ''[[Pensées]]'', the former set in the conflict between Jansenists and [[Jesuits]]. In this year, he also wrote an important treatise on the arithmetical triangle.  Between 1658 and 1659 he wrote on the [[cycloid]] and its use in calculating the volume of solids.

Pascal had poor [[health]] especially after his eighteenth year and his death came just two months after his 39th birthday.&lt;ref&gt;Hald, Anders ''A History of Probability and Statistics and Its Applications before 1750'', (Wiley Publications, 1990) pp.44&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Pascal was born in [[Clermont-Ferrand]]; he lost his mother, Antoinette Begon, at the age of three.&lt;ref&gt;Devlin, Keith, ''The Unfinished Game: Pascal, Fermat, and the Seventeenth-Century Letter that Made the World Modern'', Basic Books; 1 edition (2008), ISBN 978-0-465-00910-7, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; His father, [[Étienne Pascal]] (1588–1651), who also had an interest in science and mathematics, was a local judge and member of the &quot;[[Nobles of the Robe|Noblesse de Robe]]&quot;.  Pascal had two sisters, the younger [[Jacqueline Pascal|Jacqueline]] and the elder Gilberte.

In 1631, five years after the death of his wife,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=O'Connor |first1=J.J. |last2=Robertson |first2=E.F. |authorlink1=John J. O'Connor (mathematician) |authorlink2=Edmund F. Robertson |title=Étienne Pascal |url=http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Pascal_Etienne.html |date=August 2006 |publisher=[[University of St Andrews|University of St. Andrews, Scotland]] |accessdate=5 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Étienne Pascal moved with his children to Paris. The newly arrived family soon hired Louise Delfault, a maid who eventually became an instrumental member of the family.  Étienne, who never remarried, decided that he alone would educate his children, for they all showed extraordinary intellectual ability, particularly his son Blaise.  The young Pascal showed an amazing aptitude for mathematics and science. At the age of eleven, he composed a short treatise on the sounds of vibrating bodies, and Étienne responded by forbidding his son to further pursue mathematics until the age of fifteen so as not to harm his study of [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]]. One day, however, Étienne found Blaise (now twelve) writing an independent proof that the sum of the [[angle]]s of a [[triangle]] is equal to two [[right angle]]s with a piece of coal on a wall. From then on, the boy was allowed to study [[Euclid]] and to sit in as a silent on-looker at the gatherings of some of the greatest mathematicians and scientists in Europe—such as [[Gilles de Roberval|Roberval]], [[Desargues]], [[Mydorge]], [[Pierre Gassendi|Gassendi]], and [[Descartes]]—in the monastic cell of [[Marin Mersenne|Père Mersenne]].

Particularly of interest to Pascal was a work of Desargues on [[conic section]]s. Following Desargues' thinking, the sixteen-year-old Pascal produced, as a means of proof, a short treatise on what was called the &quot;Mystic Hexagram&quot;, ''Essai pour les coniques'' (&quot;Essay on Conics&quot;) and sent it—his first serious work of mathematics—to [[Marin Mersenne|Père Mersenne]] in Paris; it is known still today as  [[Pascal's theorem]]. It states that if a hexagon is inscribed in a circle (or conic) then the three intersection points of opposite sides lie on a line (called the Pascal line).

Pascal's work was so precocious that Descartes, when shown the manuscript, refused to believe that the composition was not by the elder Pascal.
When assured by Mersenne that it was, indeed, the product of the son not the father, Descartes dismissed it with a sniff: &quot;I do not find it strange that he has offered demonstrations about conics more appropriate than those of the ancients,&quot; adding, &quot;but other matters related to this subject can be proposed that would scarcely occur to a sixteen-year-old child.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Story of Civilization]]: Volume 8, &quot;The Age of Louis XIV&quot;'' by [[Will Durant|Will &amp; Ariel Durant]]; chapter II, subsection 4.1 p.56)&lt;/ref&gt;

In France at that time offices and positions could be—and were—bought and sold. In 1631 Étienne sold his position as second president of the ''[[Cour des Aides]]'' for 65,665 [[livres]].&lt;ref&gt;Connor, James A., ''Pascal's wager: the man who played dice with God'' (HarperCollins, NY, 2006) ISBN 0-06-076691-3 p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; The money was invested in a [[government bond]] which provided if not a lavish then certainly a comfortable income which allowed the Pascal family to move to, and enjoy, Paris. But in 1638 Richelieu, desperate for money to carry on the [[Thirty Years' War]], defaulted on the government's bonds. Suddenly Étienne Pascal's worth had dropped from nearly 66,000 livres to less than 7,300.

Like so many others, Étienne was eventually forced to flee Paris because of his opposition to the fiscal policies of [[Cardinal Richelieu]], leaving his three children in the care of his neighbor Madame Sainctot, a great beauty with an infamous past who kept one of the most glittering and intellectual salons in all France. It was only when Jacqueline performed well in a children's play with Richelieu in attendance that Étienne was pardoned. In time Étienne was back in good graces with the cardinal, and in 1639 had been appointed the king's commissioner of taxes in the city of [[Rouen]] — a city whose tax records, thanks to uprisings, were in utter chaos.

In 1642, in an effort to ease his father's endless, exhausting calculations, and recalculations, of taxes owed and paid, Pascal, not yet nineteen,  constructed a mechanical calculator capable of addition and subtraction, called [[Pascal's calculator]] or the Pascaline.  The [[Musée des Arts et Métiers]] in Paris and the [[Zwinger|Zwinger museum]] in [[Dresden]], [[Germany]], exhibit two of his original mechanical calculators. Though these machines are early forerunners to [[computer engineering]], the calculator failed to be a great commercial success. Because it was extraordinarily expensive the [[Pascaline]] became little more than a toy, and [[status symbol]], for the very rich both in France and throughout Europe. However, Pascal continued to make improvements to his design through the next decade and built twenty machines in total.

==Contributions to mathematics==
[[File:PascalTriangleAnimated2.gif|thumb|[[Pascal's triangle]]. Each number is the sum of the two directly above it. The triangle demonstrates many mathematical properties in addition to showing [[binomial coefficients]].]]

Pascal continued to influence mathematics throughout his life. His ''Traité du triangle arithmétique'' (&quot;Treatise on the Arithmetical Triangle&quot;) of 1653 described a convenient tabular presentation for [[binomial coefficient]]s, now called [[Pascal's triangle]].  The triangle can also be represented:

|}He defines the numbers in the triangle by [[recursion]]:  Call the number in the (m+1)st row and (n+1)st column t&lt;sub&gt;mn&lt;/sub&gt;.  Then t&lt;sub&gt;mn&lt;/sub&gt; = t&lt;sub&gt;m-1,n&lt;/sub&gt; + t&lt;sub&gt;m,n-1&lt;/sub&gt;, for m = 0, 1, 2... and n = 0, 1, 2...  The boundary conditions are t&lt;sub&gt;m, -1&lt;/sub&gt; = 0, t&lt;sub&gt;-1, n&lt;/sub&gt; for m = 1, 2, 3... and n = 1, 2, 3...  The generator t&lt;sub&gt;00&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.  Pascal concludes with the proof,
:&lt;math&gt;t_{mn} = \frac{(m+n)(m+n-1)...(m+1)}{n(n-1)...1}.\ &lt;/math&gt;

In 1654, prompted by a friend interested in gambling problems, he corresponded with [[Fermat]] on the subject, and from that collaboration was born the mathematical theory of [[probability|probabilities]]. The friend was the [[Chevalier de Méré]], and the specific problem was that of two players who want to finish a game early and, given the current circumstances of the game, want to [[division of the stakes|divide the stakes fairly]], based on the chance each has of winning the game from that point.  From this discussion, the notion of [[expected value]] was introduced. Pascal later (in the ''Pensées'') used a probabilistic argument, [[Pascal's Wager]], to justify belief in [[God]] and a virtuous life. The work done by Fermat and Pascal into the calculus of probabilities laid important groundwork for [[Leibniz|Leibniz']] formulation of the [[infinitesimal calculus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.math.rutgers.edu/courses/436/Honors02/leibniz.html |title=The Mathematical Leibniz |publisher=Math.rutgers.edu |accessdate=2009-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a religious experience in 1654, Pascal mostly gave up work in mathematics. However, after a sleepless night in 1658, he anonymously offered a prize for the [[numerical integration|quadrature]] of a [[cycloid]]. Solutions were offered by [[John Wallis]], [[Christiaan Huygens]], [[Christopher Wren]], and others; Pascal, under the pseudonym Amos Dettonville, published his own solution. Controversy and heated argument followed after Pascal announced himself the winner.

===Philosophy of mathematics===
Pascal's major contribution to the [[philosophy of mathematics]] came with his ''De l'Esprit géométrique'' (&quot;Of the Geometrical Spirit&quot;), originally written as a preface to a geometry textbook for one of the famous &quot;''[[Petites écoles de Port-Royal|Petites-Ecoles de Port-Royal]]&quot; (&quot;Little Schools of Port-Royal&quot;)''. The work was unpublished until over a century after his death. Here, Pascal looked into the issue of discovering truths, arguing that the ideal of such a method would be to found all propositions on already established truths. At the same time, however, he claimed this was impossible because such established truths would require other truths to back them up—first principles, therefore, cannot be reached. Based on this, Pascal argued that the procedure used in geometry was as perfect as possible, with certain principles assumed and other propositions developed from them. Nevertheless, there was no way to know the assumed principles to be true.

Pascal also used ''De l'Esprit géométrique'' to develop a theory of [[definition]]. He distinguished between definitions which are conventional labels defined by the writer and definitions which are within the language and understood by everyone because they naturally designate their referent. The second type would be characteristic of the philosophy of [[essentialism]]. Pascal claimed that only definitions of the first type were important to science and mathematics, arguing that those fields should adopt the philosophy of [[Formalism (philosophy)|formalism]] as formulated by Descartes.

In ''De l'Art de persuader'' (&quot;On the Art of Persuasion&quot;), Pascal looked deeper into geometry's [[axiomatic method]], specifically the question of how people come to be convinced of the [[axioms]] upon which later conclusions are based. Pascal agreed with [[Montaigne]] that achieving certainty in these axioms and conclusions through human methods is impossible. He asserted that these principles can only be grasped through intuition, and that this fact underscored the necessity for submission to [[God]] in searching out truths.

==Contributions to the physical sciences==
[[File:Blaise Pascal 2.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait of Pascal]]

Pascal's work in the fields of the study of [[hydrodynamics]] and [[hydrostatics]] centered on the principles of [[hydraulic fluid]]s. His inventions include the [[hydraulic press]] (using hydraulic pressure to multiply force) and the [[syringe]]. By 1646, Pascal had learned of [[Evangelista Torricelli|Evangelista Torricelli's]] experimentation with [[barometer]]s. Having replicated an experiment which involved placing a tube filled with mercury upside down in a bowl of mercury, Pascal questioned what force kept some mercury in the tube and what filled the space above the mercury in the tube. At the time, most scientists contended that, rather than a [[vacuum]], some invisible matter was present. This was based on the Aristotelian notion that creation was a thing of substance, whether visible or invisible; and this substance was forever in motion. Furthermore, &quot;Everything that is in motion must be moved by something,&quot; [[Aristotle]] declared.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Physics'', VII, 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, to the Aristotelian trained scientists of Pascal's time, a vacuum was an impossibility. How so? As proof it was pointed out:
*Light passed through the so-called &quot;vacuum&quot; in the glass tube.
*Aristotle wrote how everything moved, and must be moved by something.
*Therefore, since there had to be an invisible &quot;something&quot; to move the light through the glass tube, there was no vacuum in the tube. Not in the glass tube or anywhere else. Vacuums—the absence of any and everything—were simply an impossibility.

Following more experimentation in this vein, in 1647 Pascal produced ''Experiences nouvelles touchant le vide'' (&quot;New Experiments with the Vacuum&quot;), which detailed basic rules describing to what degree various liquids could be supported by air pressure. It also provided reasons why it was indeed a vacuum above the column of liquid in a barometer tube.

On September 19, 1648, after many months of Pascal's friendly but insistent prodding, [[Florin Périer]], husband of Pascal's elder sister Gilberte, was finally able to carry out the fact finding mission vital to Pascal's theory. The account, written by Périer, reads:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;The weather was chancy last Saturday...[but] around five o'clock that morning...the [[Puy-de-Dôme]] was visible...so I decided to give it a try. Several important people of the city of [[Clermont-Ferrand|Clermont]] had asked me to let them know when I would make the ascent...I was delighted to have them with me in this great work...

&quot;...at eight o'clock we met in the gardens of the Minim Fathers, which has the lowest elevation in town....First I poured sixteen pounds of [[Mercury (element)|quicksilver]]...into a vessel...then took several glass tubes...each four feet long and [[Hermetic seal|hermetically sealed]] at one end and opened at the other...then placed them in the vessel [of quicksilver]...I found the quick silver stood at 26&quot; and 3½ lines above the quicksilver in the vessel...I repeated the experiment two more times while standing in the same spot...[they] produced the same result each time...

&quot;I attached one of the tubes to the vessel and marked the height of the quicksilver and...asked Father Chastin, one of the Minim Brothers...to watch if any changes should occur through the day...Taking the other tube and a portion of the quick silver...I walked to the top of [[Puy-de-Dôme]], about 500 [[fathoms]] higher than the monastery, where upon experiment...found that the quicksilver reached a height of only 23&quot; and 2 lines...I repeated the experiment five times with care...each at different points on the summit...found the same height of quicksilver...in each case...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Périer to Pascal, September 1647, Pascal, Blaise. ''Oeuvres complètes''. (Paris: Seuil, 1960), 2:682.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Pascal replicated the experiment in Paris by carrying a barometer up to the top of the bell tower at the church of [[Saint-Jacques Tower|Saint-Jacques-de-la-Boucherie]], a height of about fifty meters. The mercury dropped two lines. These, and other lesser experiments carried out by Pascal, were hailed throughout Europe as establishing the principle and value of the barometer.

In the face of criticism that some invisible matter must exist in Pascal's empty space, Pascal, in his reply to [[Estienne Noel]],&lt;!-- WAIT--WAIT! Before you remove the brackets, consider writing a new article! --&gt; gave one of the seventeenth century's major statements on the scientific method, which is a striking anticipation of the idea popularised by [[Karl Popper]] that scientific theories are characterised by their [[falsifiability]]: &quot;In order to show that a hypothesis is evident, it does not suffice that all the phenomena follow from it; instead, if it leads to something contrary to a single one of the phenomena, that suffices to establish its falsity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Pour faire qu'une hypothèse soit évidente, il ne suffit pas que tous les phénomènes s'en ensuivent, au lieu que, s'il s'ensuit quelque chose de contraire à un seul des phénomènes, cela suffit pour assurer de sa fausseté'', in ''Les Lettres de Blaise Pascal: Accompagnées de Lettres de ses Correspondants Publiées'', ed. Maurice Beaufreton, 6th edition (Paris: G. Crès, 1922), 25-26, available at http://gallica.bnf.fr and translated in Saul Fisher, ''Pierre Gassendi's Philosophy and Science: Atomism for Empiricists'' Brill's Studies in Intellectual History 131 (Leiden: E. J. Brill, 2005), 126 n.7&lt;/ref&gt; His insistence on the existence of the vacuum also led to conflict with other prominent scientists, including Descartes.

Pascal introduced a primitive form of [[roulette]] and the roulette wheel in the 17th century in his search for a [[perpetual motion]] machine.&lt;ref&gt;
[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], [http://web.mit.edu/invent/iow/pascal.html &quot;Inventor of the Week Archive: Pascal : Mechanical Calculator&quot;], May 2003. &quot;Pascal worked on many versions of the devices, leading to his attempt to create a perpetual motion machine. He has been credited with introducing the roulette machine, which was a by-product of these experiments.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious conversion===
Two basic influences led him to his conversion: sickness and [[Jansenism]].  From as early as his eighteenth year, Pascal suffered from a nervous ailment that left him hardly a day without pain.  In 1647, a paralytic attack so disabled him that he could not move without crutches.  His head ached, his bowels burned, his legs and feet were continually cold, and required wearisome aids to circulate the blood; he wore stockings steeped in brandy to warm his feet.  Partly to get better medical treatment, he moved to Paris with his sister Jacqueline.  His health improved, but his nervous system had been permanently damaged.  Henceforth, he was subject to deepening [[hypochondria]], which affected his character and his philosophy.  He became irritable, subject to fits of proud and imperious anger, and seldom smiled.&lt;ref name=&quot;sickness&quot;&gt;Sainte-Beuve, ''Port-Royal'', I, 89.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Pascal Pajou Louvre RF2981.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Pascal studying the [[cycloid]], by [[Augustin Pajou]], 1785, [[Louvre]]]]

In the winter of 1646, Pascal's 58 year-old father broke his hip when he slipped and fell on an icy street of Rouen; given the man's age and the state of medicine in the 17th century, a [[Hip fracture|broken hip]] could be a very serious condition, perhaps even fatal. Rouen was home to two of the finest doctors in France: Monsieur Doctor Deslandes and Monsieur Doctor de La Bouteillerie. The elder Pascal &quot;would not let anyone other than these men attend him...It was a good choice, for the old man survived and was able to walk again...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Connor, James A., ''Pascal's wager: the man who played dice with God'' (HarperCollins, NY, 2006) ISBN 0-06-076691-3 p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; But treatment and rehabilitation took three months, during which time La Bouteillerie and Deslandes had become household guests.

Both men were followers of [[Jean Guillebert]]&lt;!-- WAIT--WAIT! Before you remove the brackets, consider writing a new article! --&gt;, proponent of a splinter group from the main body of Catholic teaching known as [[Jansenism]]. This still fairly small sect was making surprising inroads into the French Catholic community at that time.  It espoused rigorous [[Augustinism]].  Blaise spoke with the doctors frequently, and upon his successful treatment of Étienne, borrowed works by Jansenist authors from them.  In this period, Pascal experienced a sort of &quot;first conversion&quot; and began to write on theological subjects in the course of the following year.

Pascal fell away from this initial religious engagement and experienced a few years of what some biographers have called his &quot;worldly period&quot; (1648–54).  His father died in 1651 and left his inheritance to Pascal and Jacqueline, of which Pascal acted as her conservator.  Jacqueline announced that she would soon become a [[postulant]] in the Jansenist convent of [[Port-Royal-des-Champs|Port-Royal]].  Pascal was deeply affected and very sad, not because of her choice, but because of his chronic poor health; he too needed her.&lt;blockquote&gt;

&quot;Suddenly there was war in the Pascal household. Blaise pleaded with Jacqueline not to leave, but she was adamant. He commanded her to stay, but that didn't work, either. At the heart of this was...Blaise's fear of abandonment...if Jacqueline entered Port-Royal, she would have to leave her inheritance behind...[but] nothing would change her mind.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Miel, Jan. ''Pascal and Theology''. (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1969), p. 122&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By the end of October in 1651, a truce had been reached between brother and sister.  In return for a healthy annual stipend, Jacqueline signed over her part of the inheritance to her brother.  Gilberte had already been given her inheritance in the form of a dowry.  In early January, Jacqueline left for Port-Royal. On that day, according to Gilberte concerning her brother, &quot;He retired very sadly to his rooms without seeing Jacqueline, who was waiting in the little parlor...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Jacqueline Pascal, ''&quot;Memoir&quot;'' p. 87&lt;/ref&gt;
In early June of 1653, after what must have seemed like endless badgering from Jacqueline,
Pascal formally signed over the whole of his sister's inheritance to Port-Royal, which, to him, &quot;had begun to smell like a cult.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Miel, Jan. ''Pascal and Theology''. (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1969), p. 124&lt;/ref&gt; With two-thirds of his father's estate now gone, the 29 year old Pascal was now consigned to genteel poverty.

For a while, Pascal pursued the life of a bachelor.  He showed strong interest in one woman while in Auvergne. He referred to her as the &quot;[[Sappho]] of the countryside.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;sappho&quot;&gt;Pascal, ''[[Pensées]]'', Havet ed. Introd., p. ''civ''.&lt;/ref&gt;  During this time, Pascal wrote ''Discours sur les passions de l'amour'' (&quot;Conversation about the Passions of Love&quot;) and apparently contemplated marriage — which he was later to describe as &quot;the lowest of the conditions of life permitted to a Christian.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;marriage&quot;&gt;Mesnard, ''Pascal'', p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;
Jacqueline reproached him for his frivolity and prayed for his reform.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Story of Civilization]]: Volume 8, &quot;The Age of Louis XIV&quot;'' by [[Will Durant|Will &amp; Ariel Durant]], p. 58)&lt;/ref&gt; During visits to his sister at Port-Royal in 1654, he displayed contempt for affairs of the world but was not drawn to God.&lt;ref name=&quot;ep52&quot;&gt;Richard H. Popkin, Paul Edwards (ed.), ''Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', 1967 edition, s.v. &quot;Pascal, Blaise.&quot;, vol. 6, p. 52–55, New York: Macmillan&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brush with death===
In October 1654, Pascal is said to have been involved in an accident at the  [[Pont de Neuilly|Neuilly bridge]] where the horses plunged over the parapet and the carriage nearly followed them. Fortunately, the reins broke and the coach hung halfway over the edge. Pascal and his friends emerged unscathed, but the sensitive philosopher, terrified by the nearness of death, fainted away and remained unconscious for some time.
On 23 November 1654, between 10:30 and 12:30 at night, Pascal had an intense [[Vision (religion)|religious vision]] and immediately recorded the experience in a brief note to himself which began: &quot;Fire. God of Abraham, God of Isaac, God of Jacob, not of the philosophers and the scholars...&quot; and concluded by quoting Psalm 119:16: &quot;I will not forget thy word. Amen.&quot; He seems to have carefully sewn this document into his coat and always transferred it when he changed clothes; a servant discovered it only by chance after his death.&lt;ref name=&quot;oc618&quot;&gt;Pascal, Blaise. ''Oeuvres complètes''. (Paris: Seuil, 1960), p. 618&lt;/ref&gt; This piece is now known as the ''Memorial''. The story of the carriage accident as having led to the experience described in the ''Memorial'' is disputed by some scholars.&lt;ref&gt;MathPages, [http://www.mathpages.com/home/kmath558/kmath558.htm Hold Your Horses]&lt;/ref&gt;
His belief and religious commitment revitalized, Pascal visited the older of two convents at [[Port-Royal-des-Champs|Port-Royal]] for a two-week retreat in January 1655. For the next four years, he regularly travelled between Port-Royal and Paris.  It was at this point immediately after his conversion when he began writing his first major literary work on religion, the ''Provincial Letters''.

===The ''Provincial Letters''===
{{Main|Lettres provinciales}}
{{French literature (small)}}

Beginning in 1656, Pascal published his memorable attack on [[casuistry]], a popular [[Ethics|ethical]] method used by [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] thinkers in the early modern period (especially the [[Jesuits]], and in particular [[Antonio Escobar y Mendoza|Antonio Escobar]]). Pascal denounced casuistry as the mere use of complex reasoning to justify moral laxity and all sorts of [[sin]]s. His method of framing his arguments was clever: the ''Provincial Letters'' pretended to be the report of a Parisian to a friend in the provinces on the moral and theological issues then exciting the intellectual and religious circles in the capital. Pascal, combining the fervor of a convert with the wit and polish of a man of the world, reached a new level of style in French prose.  The 18-letter series was published between 1656 and 1657 under the pseudonym Louis de Montalte and incensed [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]]. The king ordered that the book be shredded and burnt in 1660. In 1661, in the midsts of the [[formulary controversy]], the Jansenist school at Port-Royal was condemned and closed down; those involved with the school had to sign a 1656 [[papal bull]] condemning the teachings of Jansen as heretical.  The final letter from Pascal, in 1657, had defied the Pope himself, provoking [[Alexander VII]] to condemn the letters.  But that didn't stop all of educated France from reading them.  Even Pope Alexander, while publicly opposing them, nonetheless was persuaded by Pascal's arguments.  He condemned &quot;laxism&quot; in the church and ordered a revision of casuistical texts just a few years later (1665–66).

Aside from their religious influence, the ''Provincial Letters'' were popular as a literary work. Pascal's use of humor, mockery, and vicious [[satire]] in his arguments made the letters ripe for public consumption, and influenced the prose of later French writers like [[Voltaire]] and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]].

Wide praise has been given to the ''Provincial Letters''.  [[Voltaire]] called the ''Letters'' &quot;the best-written book that has yet appeared in France.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;voltaireletters&quot;&gt;Voltaire, ''Age of Louis XIV'' pp. 424, 358.&lt;/ref&gt;  And when [[Jacques-Bénigne Bossuet|Bossuet]] was asked what book he would rather have written had he not written his own, he answered, the ''Provincial Letters'' of Pascal.&lt;ref name=&quot;bossuetletters&quot;&gt;Voltaire, ''Age of Louis XIV'', p. 359.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Miracle===
When Pascal was back in Paris just after overseeing the publication of the last ''Letter'', his religion was reinforced by the close association to an apparent miracle in the chapel of the Port-Royal nunnery.  His 10-year-old niece, Marguerite Périer, was suffering from a painful [[fistula]] lacrymalis that exuded noisome pus through her eyes and nose—an affliction the doctors pronounced hopeless.  Then, on March 24, 1657, a believer presented to Port-Royal what he and others claimed to be a thorn from the crown that had tortured Christ.  The nuns, in solemn ceremony and singing psalms, placed the thorn on their altar.  Each in turn kissed the relic, and one of them, seeing Marguerite among the worshipers, took the thorn and with it touched the girl's sore.  That evening, we are told, Marguerite expressed surprise that her eye no longer pained her; her mother was astonished to find no sign of the fistula; a physician, summoned, reported that the discharge and swelling had disappeared.  He, not the nuns, spread word of what he termed a miraculous cure.  Seven other physicians who had had previous knowledge of Marguerite's fistula signed a statement that in their judgment a miracle had taken place.  The diocesan officials investigated, came to the same conclusion, and authorized a [[Te Deum]] Mass in Port-Royal.  Crowds of believers came to see and kiss the thorn; all of Catholic Paris acclaimed a miracle.  Later, both pro and anti [[Jansenists]] used this well-documented miracle to their defense.  In 1728, [[Pope Benedict XIII]] referred to the case as proving that the age of miracles had not passed.

Pascal made himself an armorial emblem of an eye surrounded by a crown of thorns, with the inscription ''Scio cui credidi''—&quot;I know whom I have believed.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;thornmiracle&quot;&gt;Sainte-Beuve, ''Port-Royal'', III, 173f.; Beard, Charles, ''Port-Royal'', I 84.&lt;/ref&gt;  His beliefs renewed, he set his mind to write his final, unfinished testament, the ''Pensées''.

===The ''Pensées''===
{{wikisource|Pensées}}
{{Main|Pensées}}
Pascal's most influential theological work, referred to posthumously as the ''Pensées'' (&quot;Thoughts&quot;), was not completed before his death.  It was to have been a sustained and coherent examination and defense of the [[Christianity|Christian faith]], with the original title ''Apologie de la religion Chrétienne'' (&quot;Defense of the Christian Religion&quot;).  What was found upon sifting through his personal items after his death were numerous scraps of paper with isolated thoughts, grouped in a tentative, but telling, order.  The first version of the detached notes appeared in print as a book in 1670 titled ''Pensées de M. Pascal sur la religion, et sur quelques autres sujets'' (&quot;Thoughts of M. Pascal on religion, and on some other subjects&quot;) and soon thereafter became a classic. One of the ''Apologie'''s main strategies was to use the contradictory philosophies of [[skepticism]] and [[stoicism]], personalized by [[Montaigne]] on one hand, and [[Epictetus]] on the other, in order to bring the unbeliever to such despair and confusion that he would embrace God. This strategy was deemed quite hazardous by [[Pierre Nicole]], [[Antoine Arnauld]] and other friends and scholars of Port-Royal, who were concerned that these fragmentary &quot;thoughts&quot; might lead to skepticism rather than to piety. Henceforth, they concealed the skeptical pieces and modified some of the rest, lest King or Church should take offense&lt;ref name=&quot;peity&quot;&gt;Pascal, ''[[Pensées]]'', Introduction, p. ''xxviii''; Mesnard, ''Pascal'', pp. 137–138.&lt;/ref&gt; for at that time the persecution of Port-Royal had ceased, and the editors were not interested in a renewal of controversy.  Not until the nineteenth century were the ''Pensées'' published in their full and authentic text.

Pascal's ''Pensées'' is widely considered to be a masterpiece, and a landmark in French prose.  When commenting on one particular section (Thought #72), [[Sainte-Beuve]] praised it as the finest pages in the French language.&lt;ref name=&quot;finest&quot;&gt;Sainte-Beuve, [http://books.google.com/books?id=I0P0A8XK29QC&amp;pg=PA167 ''Seventeenth Century''] ISBN 1-113-16675-4 p. 174 (2009 reprint).&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Will Durant]], in his 11-volume, comprehensive ''[[The Story of Civilization]]'' series, hailed it as &quot;the most eloquent book in French prose.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;eloquent&quot;&gt;''[[The Story of Civilization]]: Volume 8, &quot;The Age of Louis XIV&quot;'' by [[Will Durant|Will &amp; Ariel Durant]], chapter II, Subsection 4.4, p. 66 ISBN 1-56731-019-2&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''Pensées'', Pascal surveys several philosophical paradoxes: infinity and nothing, faith and reason, soul and matter, death and life, meaning and vanity—seemingly arriving at no definitive conclusions besides humility, ignorance, and grace.  Rolling these into one he develops [[Pascal's Wager]].

===Last works and death===
[[File:Epitaph Blaise Pascal Saint-Etienne.jpg|thumb|Pascal's epitaph in [[Saint-Étienne-du-Mont]], where he was buried]]

[[T. S. Eliot]] described him during this phase of his life as &quot;a man of the world among ascetics, and an ascetic among men of the world.&quot; Pascal's ascetic lifestyle derived from a belief that it was natural and necessary for man to suffer. In 1659, Pascal fell seriously ill. During his last years, he frequently tried to reject the ministrations of his doctors, saying, &quot;Sickness is the natural state of Christians.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;m104-&quot;&gt;Muir, Jane. [http://books.google.com/books?id=uV3rJkmnQhsC&amp;printsec=frontcover ''Of Men and Numbers'']. (New York: Dover Publications, Inc, 1996). ISBN 0-486-28973-7, p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt;

Louis XIV suppressed the Jansenist movement at Port-Royal in 1661. In response, Pascal wrote one of his final works, ''Écrit sur la signature du formulaire'' (&quot;Writ on the Signing of the Form&quot;), exhorting the Jansenists not to give in. Later that year, his sister Jacqueline died, which convinced Pascal to cease his [[polemics]]  on [[Jansenism]]. Pascal's last major achievement, returning to his mechanical genius, was inaugurating perhaps the first [[bus]] line, moving passengers within Paris in a carriage with many seats.

In 1662, Pascal's illness became more violent, and his emotional condition had severely worsened since his sister´s death, which happened the previous year. Aware that his health was fading quickly, he sought a move to the hospital for incurable diseases, but his doctors declared that he was too unstable to be carried. In Paris on August 18, 1662, Pascal went into convulsions and received [[extreme unction]]. He died the next morning, his last words being &quot;May God never abandon me,&quot; and was buried in the cemetery of [[Saint-Étienne-du-Mont]].&lt;ref name=&quot;m104-&quot;/&gt;

An [[autopsy]] performed after his death revealed grave problems with his stomach and other organs of his abdomen, along with [[brain damage|damage to his brain]]. Despite the autopsy, the cause of his poor health was never precisely determined, though speculation focuses on [[tuberculosis]], [[stomach cancer]], or a combination of the two.&lt;ref name=&quot;m103&quot;&gt;Muir, Jane. [http://books.google.com/books?id=uV3rJkmnQhsC&amp;printsec=frontcover ''Of Men and Numbers'']. (New York: Dover Publications, Inc, 1996). ISBN 0-486-28973-7, p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt; The headaches which afflicted Pascal are generally attributed to his brain [[lesion]].

==Legacy==
[[File:001Paskal.JPG|left|thumb|160px|Death mask of Blaise Pascal.]]

In honor of his scientific contributions, the name '''Pascal''' has been given to the [[pascal (unit)|SI unit of pressure]], to a [[Pascal (programming language)|programming language]], and [[Pascal's law]] (an important principle of hydrostatics), and as mentioned above, Pascal's triangle and Pascal's wager still bear his name.

Pascal's development of probability theory was his most influential contribution to mathematics. Originally applied to [[gambling]], today it is extremely important in [[economics]], especially in [[actuarial science]]. John Ross writes, &quot;Probability theory and the discoveries following it changed the way we regard uncertainty, risk, decision-making, and an individual's and society's ability to influence the course of future events.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ross|first1=John F.|title=Pascal's legacy|journal=EMBO reports|volume=5|pages=S7|year=2004|pmid=15459727|pmc=1299210 |doi=10.1038/sj.embor.7400229}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it should be noted that Pascal and Fermat, though doing important early work in probability theory, did not develop the field very far. [[Christiaan Huygens]], learning of the subject from the correspondence of Pascal and Fermat, wrote the first book on the subject. Later figures who continued the development of the theory include [[Abraham de Moivre]] and [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]].

In literature, Pascal is regarded as one of the most important authors of the French Classical Period and is read today as one of the greatest masters of French prose. His use of satire and wit influenced later [[polemic]]ists. The content of his literary work is best remembered for its strong opposition to the [[rationalism]] of [[René Descartes]] and simultaneous assertion that the main countervailing philosophy, [[empiricism]], was also insufficient for determining major truths.

The '''Brythonic''' or '''Brittonic languages''' ({{lang-cy|ieithoedd Brythonaidd/Prydeinig}}, {{lang-kw|yethow Brythonek/Predennek}}, {{lang-br|yezhoù Predenek}}) form one of the two branches of the [[Insular Celtic languages|Insular Celtic]] language family, the other being [[Goidelic]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=-k8QAAAAYAAJ History of English: A Sketch of the Origin and Development of the English Language]&lt;/ref&gt; The name ''Brythonic'' was derived by [[Wales|Welsh]] [[Celtic studies|Celticist]] [[John Rhys]] from the [[Welsh language|Welsh]] word ''Brython'', meaning an indigenous [[Britons (historical)|Briton]] as opposed to an [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] or [[Gaels|Gael]]. The name ''Brittonic'' derives ultimately from the name ''Prettanike'', recorded  by Greek authors for the [[British Isles]]. Some authors reserve the term ''Brittonic'' for the modified later Brythonic languages after about AD 600.

The Brythonic languages derive from the [[British language (Celtic)|British language]], spoken throughout Britain south of the [[Firth of Forth]] during the [[British Iron Age|Iron Age]] and [[Roman Britain|Roman period]]. North of the Forth, the [[Pictish language]] is considered to be related; it is possible it was a Brythonic language, but it may have been a sister language. In the 4th and 5th centuries emigrating Britons also took Brythonic speech to the continent, most significantly in [[Brittany]]. During the next few centuries the language began to split into several dialects, eventually evolving into [[Welsh language|Welsh]], [[Cornish language|Cornish]], [[Breton language|Breton]], and [[Cumbric language|Cumbric]]. Welsh and Breton continue to be spoken as native languages, while a revival in Cornish has led to an increase in speakers of that language. Cumbric is extinct, having been replaced by [[Goidelic languages|Goidelic]] and [[English language|English]] speech. The [[Isle of Man]] may also have had a Brythonic language that was replaced with a Goidelic one. By emigration there are also communities of Brythonic language speakers in [[England]], [[France]], and [[Y Wladfa]], the Welsh settlement in [[Patagonia]].

==Evidence==
Knowledge of the Brythonic languages comes from a variety of sources. For the early languages information is obtained from coins, inscriptions and comments by classical writers as well as place names and personal names recorded by them. For later languages there is information from medieval writers and modern native speakers, together with place names. The names recorded in the Roman period are given in Rivet and Smith.

==Characteristics==
The Brythonic branch is also referred to as '''P-Celtic''' (like [[Gaulish]]) because the Brythonic [[reflex (linguistics)|reflex]] of the Proto-Indo-European phoneme *''k&lt;sup&gt;w&lt;/sup&gt;'' is ''p'' as opposed to the [[Goidelic]] ''c''. Such nomenclature usually implies an acceptance of the [[P-Celtic and Q-Celtic|P-Celtic]] hypothesis rather than the Insular Celtic hypothesis (for a discussion, see [[Celtic languages]]).

Other major characteristics include:
*the treatment of -''m'', -''n'' as -''am'', -''an''.
*initial ''s-'' followed by a vowel was changed to ''h-''
**Welsh ''hen'' &quot;old&quot;, ''hir'' &quot;long&quot;, ''hafal'' &quot;similar&quot;
**Breton ''hen'' &quot;ancient&quot;, ''hir'' &quot;long&quot;, ''hañval'' &quot;similar&quot;
**Irish ''sean'' &quot;old&quot;, ''sior'' &quot;long&quot;, ''samail'' &quot;similar&quot;
*Brythonic retains original nasals before -t
**Breton ''kant'' &quot;hundred&quot; vs. Irish ''céad''
*''sp, sr, sv/sw'' became ''f, fr, chw''
** *''swero'' &quot;toy, game&quot; became Welsh ''chwarae'' and Breton ''c'hoari''
** *''srokna'' &quot;nostril&quot; became Welsh ''ffroen'' and Breton ''froen''.
*all other initial ''s-'' fell before consonants
**''smeru'' became Welsh ''mêr'' &quot;marrow&quot;
**''slemon'' became Welsh ''llyfn'', Breton ''levn'' &quot;smooth&quot;
*''w'' (written ''u'' in Latin texts and ''ou'' in Greek) became ''gw'' in initial position, ''w'' internally, where in Gaelic it is ''f'' in initial position and disappears internally
** ''windos'' &quot;white&quot; became Welsh ''gwyn'', Cornish ''gwynn'', Breton ''gwenn''
** ''wassos'' &quot;servant, young man&quot; became Welsh and Breton ''gwas''
*double plosives transformed into spirants: pp, cc, tt became f, ch (c'h), th (z) before a vowel or liquid
**cippus &gt; Breton ''kef'' &quot;tree trunk&quot;, Welsh ''cyff''
**cattos &gt; Breton ''kaz'', Cornish ''kath'', Welsh ''cath''
**bucca &gt; Breton boc'h'', W ''boch''
*single voiceless plosives and voiced ''d'', ''b'', and ''m'' in an intervocalic position became soft spirants
**Welsh ''dd''[ð], ''th''[θ], ''f'' [v]
**Breton ''z'', ''zh'', ''v''

==Classification==
The family tree of the Brythonic languages is as follows:

*[[Insular Celtic languages|Insular Celtic]]
**[[British language (Celtic)|British]] ancestral to:
***[[Western Brythonic]] ancestral to:
****[[Cumbric language|Cumbric]]
****[[Welsh language|Welsh]]
***[[Proto-Southwestern Brythonic|Southwestern Brythonic]] ancestral to:
****[[Cornish language|Cornish]]
****[[Breton language|Breton]]

The major Brythonic languages today are [[Welsh language|Welsh]] and [[Breton language|Breton]], both of which survive as community languages. The [[Cornish language]] died out at the end of the 18th century, but attempts at reviving it started in the 20th century and are ongoing. Also notable are the extinct language [[Cumbric language|Cumbric]], and possibly the extinct [[Pictish language|Pictish]] although this may be best considered to be a sister of the Brythonic languages. The late [[Kenneth H. Jackson]] argued during the 1950s, from some of the few remaining examples of stone inscriptions, that the Picts may have also used a non-[[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] language, but some modern scholars of Pictish do not agree.

==History and origins==
[[File:Map Gaels Brythons Picts.png|thumb|right|250px|Britain &amp; Ireland in the mid-5th century [[Common Era|CE]], between the [[End of Roman rule in Britain|Roman withdrawal]] and the [[Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain|founding of Anglo-Saxon kingdoms]].

{{legend|Red|outline=#aaaaaa|Mainly Brythonic areas.}}]]
The modern Brythonic languages are generally considered to all derive from a common ancestral language termed ''Brittonic'', ''British'', ''Common Brythonic'', ''Old Brythonic'' or ''Proto-Brythonic'', which is thought to have developed from [[Proto-Celtic]] or early [[Insular Celtic]] by the 6th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=An Atlas for Celtic Studies| first=John T.| last=Koch| publisher=Oxbow Books| location=Oxford| year=2007| isbn=978-1-84217-309-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

There are a number of alternative hypotheses, none of which has found wide acceptance. [[Mario Alinei]] denies the existence of a pre-Celtic language and says that Celtic languages arrived in the Paleolithic.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} [[Stephen Oppenheimer]] has suggested that Belgic invasions in the 1st century BC could have brought a [[Germanic language]] to Britain.

Brythonic languages were probably spoken prior to the Roman invasion at least in the majority of [[Great Britain]] south of the rivers [[River Forth|Forth]] and [[River Clyde|Clyde]], though the [[Isle of Man]] later had a Goidelic language, [[Manx language|Manx]]. Northern Scotland mainly spoke [[Pritennic]], which became [[Pictish]], that may have been a Brythonic language. The theory has been advanced (notably by [[O'Rahilly's historical model|T. F. O'Rahilly]]) that part of [[Ireland]] spoke a Brythonic language, usually termed ''Ivernic'', before it was displaced by the Q-Celtic [[Irish language]], although the authors Dillon and Chadwick reject this theory as being implausible.

During the period of the Roman occupation of [[Southern Britain]] (AD 43 to c. 410), Common Brythonic borrowed a large stock of [[Latin]] words, both for concepts unfamiliar in the pre-urban society of Celtic Britain, such as urbanisation and tactics of warfare, and for rather more mundane words which displaced native terms (most notably, the word for &quot;fish&quot; in all the Brythonic languages derives from the Latin ''piscis'' rather than the native *''ēskos'', which may survive, however, in the Welsh name of the [[River Usk]], {{lang|cy|''Wysg''}}). Approximately 800 of these Latin loan-words have survived in the three modern Brythonic languages. ''Romano-British'' is the name for the Latinised form of the language used by Roman authors.

It is probable that at the start of the Post-Roman period ''Common Brythonic'' was differentiated into at least two major dialect groups - Southwestern and Western (in addition we may posit additional dialects, such as Eastern Brythonic, spoken in what is now [[Eastern England]], which have left little or no evidence). Between the end of the Roman occupation and the mid 6th century the two dialects began to diverge into recognisably separate languages, the Western into Cumbric and Welsh, and the Southwestern into [[Cornish language|Cornish]] and its closely related sister language [[Breton language|Breton]], which was carried from the south west of Great Britain to continental [[Armorica]].  Jackson showed that a few of the dialect distinctions between West and Southwest Brythonic go back a long way. New divergencies began around AD 500 but other changes which were shared occurred in the 6th century.  Other common changes occurred in the 7th century onward and are possibly due to inherent tendencies. Thus the concept of a common Brythonic language ends by AD 600. It is thought that substantial numbers of Britons remained in the expanding area controlled by [[Anglo-Saxon]]s {{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}, but the only information on their language may be obtained from place names. Over time it is thought they gradually adopted the [[English language]]{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}.

The Brythonic languages spoken in what is now [[Scotland]], the [[Isle of Man]] and what is now [[England]] began to be displaced in the 5th century through the influence of [[Irish people|Irish]] ([[Scottish people|Scots]]), [[Norsemen|Norse]] and [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] invaders. The displacement of the languages of Brythonic descent was probably complete in all of this territory, (except [[Cornwall]] and the English counties bordering Wales), by the 11th century (date of extinction in various parts of the territory is debated).

The regular [[consonant]]al [[sound change]]s from Proto-Celtic to the [[Welsh language]] and [[Cornish language]] may be summarised in the following table. Where the Welsh and Cornish graphemes have a different value from the corresponding IPA symbols, the IPA equivalent is indicated between slashes. V represents a vowel; C represents a consonant.

==Remnants in England, Scotland and Ireland==
===Place names and river names===
{{see|Celtic toponymy|Toponymy in Great Britain}}
The principal legacy left behind in those territories from which the Brythonic languages were displaced is that of [[toponym]]s (place names) and [[hydronyms]] (river names). There are many Brythonic place names in lowland Scotland and in the parts of England where it is agreed that substantial Brythonic speakers remained (Brythonic names, apart from those of the former Romano-British towns, are scarce over most of England). Names derived (sometimes indirectly) from Brythonic include [[London]], [[Penicuik]], [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]], [[Aberdeen]], [[York]], [[Dorchester, Dorset|Dorchester]], [[Dover]] and [[Colchester]]{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}. Brythonic elements found in England include ''bre-'' and ''bal-'' for hills, and  [[carr (fen)|carr]] for a high rocky place, while some such as combe or [[coombe|coomb(e)]] for a small deep valley and [[tor (geology)|tor]] for a hill are examples of Brythonic words that were borrowed into English. Others reflect the presence of Brythons, such as [[Dumbarton]] - from the [[Scottish Gaelic]] ''Dùn Breatainn'' meaning &quot;Fort of the Britons&quot;, or Walton (several) meaning a 'tun' or settlement where '[[walha]]' (Welsh/Brythons) still lived. 

The number of Celtic river names in England generally increases from east to west, a map showing these being given by Jackson. These names include ones such as Avon, Chew, Frome, Axe, Brue and Exe.
Also river names containing the roots &quot; der- / dar- / dur- &quot; and &quot; -went &quot; E.G. &quot; Derwent, Darwen,Dart,Deer, Adur, Dour,Darent, Went &quot;. The Celtic origins seem likely, the meanings more controversial:
Some associate &quot; Der- / Dar- &quot; with the Brythonic word for &quot; OAK(S) &quot; ( &quot; derv / dervenn&quot; in Breton, &quot; derow / derowenn &quot; in Cornish &quot; derw / derwen &quot; in Welsh. Possible but there would have been a lot of oaks around; maybe there was. As to &quot; -went &quot; some claim this to be a word for &quot; valley &quot; or associated with the Celtic word &quot; nant &quot; for river ( like in Welsh ). This seems a very unlikely derivation, as there is no known initial consonantal changes from &quot; n- &quot; to &quot; w- &quot;. More likely is that the &quot; Der- / Dar- / Dur- &quot; means &quot; water &quot; [ c.f. &quot; Dour &quot; in Breton, dowr in Cornish, Dŵr  in Welsh.] and &quot; -(g)wen(n)(t) &quot; means white / pure.

===Brittonicisms in English===
{{main|Brittonicisms in English}}
{{see|Welsh loanwords in English}}
Some have argued that Celtic has acted as a substrate to English for both the lexicon and syntax. It is generally accepted that linguistic effects on English were lexically rather poor aside from toponyms, consisting of a few domestic words, which may include hubbub, dad,  [[peat]], [[bucket]], crock, noggin, gob (cf. Gaelic ''gob''), nook; and the dialectal term for a [[badger]], i.e. ''brock'' (cf. Welsh ''broch'', and Gaelic ''broc''). Another legacy may be the sheep-counting system [[Yan Tan Tethera]] in the west, in the traditionally Celtic areas of England such as [[Cumbria]]. Several Cornish mining words are still in use in English language mining terminology, such as [[costean]], [[gunnies]], and [[vug]].&lt;ref&gt;''Dictionary of Mining, Mineral, and Related Terms'' by American Geological Institute and U S Bureau of Mines (pages 128, 249, and 613)&lt;/ref&gt;

Those who argue against the theory of a Brythonic substratum and heavy influence point out that many toponyms have no semantic continuation from the Brythonic language. A notable example is &quot;Avon&quot; which comes from the Welsh term for river ''abona''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=Avon&amp;searchmode=none&lt;/ref&gt; but was used by the English as a personal name. Likewise the [[River Ouse, Yorkshire]] contains the word ''usa'' which merely means water&lt;ref&gt;A. Room (ed.) 1992: ''Brewer's Dictionary of Names'', Oxford: Helicon, p. 396-7.&lt;/ref&gt; and the name of the river Trent simply comes from the Welsh word for a trepasser (''an over-flowing river'')&lt;ref name=ecec&gt;{{cite book 
  | last = Hickey
  | first = Raymond
  | title = 'Early Contact And Parallels Between English and Celtic.' in 'Vienna English Working Papers'}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
It has been argued that the use of [[periphrastic]] constructions (using [[auxiliary verb]]s like ''do'' and ''be'') in the English [[verb]] (which is more widespread than in the other [[Germanic languages]]) is traceable to Brythonic influence although some find this very unlikely and prefer a hypothesis of North Germanic influence rather than Celtic.&lt;ref name=roberts&gt;{{cite book 
  | last = Roberts
  | first = Ian G.
  | title = 'Verbs and diachronic syntax: a comparative history of English and French
Volume 28 of Studies in natural language and linguistic theory
Volume 28 of NATO Asi Series. Series C, Mathematical and Physical Science'}}
&lt;/ref&gt; For example in literary Welsh we can have ''Caraf'' = ''I love'' and ''Yr wyf yn caru'' = ''I am loving'' where the Brythonic syntax is exactly mirrored in English, whereas in the Germanic sister languages of English we only have one form, for example ''Ich liebe'' in German. This view is not accepted by many linguists&lt;ref name=&quot;ecec&quot;/&gt;
.&lt;ref name=roberts/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.grsampson.net/QBirthOfEng.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Some researchers (Filppula ''et al.'', 2001)  argue that English syntax reflects more extensive Brythonic influences, although many argued that the influence from Celtic is very minor and that the majority comes from Irish rather than Brythonic.&lt;ref name=&quot;ecec&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gelderen&gt;{{cite book 
  | last = van Gelderen
  | first = Elly
  | title = 'A History of the English Language'}}
&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, in English [[tag question]]s, the form of the tag depends on the verb form in the main statement (''aren't I?'', ''isn't he?'', ''won't we?'' etc.). The German ''nicht wahr?'' and the French ''n'est-ce pas?'', by contrast, are fixed forms which can be used with almost any main statement. It has been claimed that the English system has been borrowed from Brythonic, since Welsh tag questions vary in almost exactly the same way.  This view is far from being generally accepted.&lt;ref name=&quot;ecec&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gelderen&quot;/&gt;

===Brythonic effect on the Goidelic languages===
Far more notable, but less well known, are the many Brythonic influences on [[Scottish Gaelic language|Scottish Gaelic]]. Like English, periphrastic constructions have come to the fore, but to a much greater degree. Scottish Gaelic contains a number of apparently P-Celtic loanwords, but as there is a far greater overlap in terms of Celtic vocabulary, than with English, it is not always possible to disentangle P and Q Celtic words. However some common words such as ''monadh'' = Welsh ''mynydd'' Cumbric ''*monidh'' are particularly evident. Often the Brythonic influence on Scots Gaelic is indicated by considering the [[Irish Gaelic]] usage which is not likely to have been influenced so much by Brythonic. In particular, the word ''srath'' ([[Anglicise]]d as &quot;Strath&quot;) is a native Goidelic word, but its usage appears to have been modified by the Brythonic cognate ''ystrad'' whose meaning is slightly different.  The effect on Irish has been the loan from British of many Latin-derived words. This has been associated with the Christianisation of Ireland from Britain.

'''Bronski Beat''' were a popular [[United Kingdom|British]] [[synthpop]] [[Trio (music)|trio]] who achieved success in the mid 1980s, particularly with the 1984 chart hit &quot;[[Smalltown Boy]]&quot;. All members of the group were openly [[homosexual]] and their songs reflected this, often containing political commentary on gay-related issues. Although many groups in the early to mid-80s had an openly gay image, Bronski Beat was one of the first groups to address the issues of gay people.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} At the height of their popularity the band consisted of singer [[Jimmy Somerville]] backed by Steve Bronski and Larry Steinbachek, both of whom played keyboards and percussion. Somerville went on to have success as lead singer of [[The Communards]] and as a solo artist.

==History==
===Early years (1983&amp;ndash;1985)===
Bronski Beat formed in 1983 when Somerville, Steinbachek and Bronski shared a three-bedroom flat in Lancaster House in [[Brixton]], southwest [[London]].

Bronski Beat signed a [[recording contract]] with [[London Records]] in 1984 after doing only nine live [[concert|gigs]]. The band's debut [[single (music)|single]], &quot;[[Smalltown Boy]]&quot;, the tale of a boy who was cast away by his family for being [[homosexual]], was a hit, peaking at #3 in the [[UK Singles Chart]].&lt;ref name=&quot;British Hit Singles &amp; Albums&quot;&gt;{{cite book

| page= 79}}&lt;/ref&gt; The single was accompanied by a promotional [[music video|video]] directed by [[Bernard Rose (director)|Bernard Rose]], showing Somerville eagerly trying to make friends at a swimming pool, then being attacked by an anti-homosexual gang, being returned to his family by the [[police]] and having to leave home. (The police officer was played by Colin Bell, then the marketing manager of [[London Records]]). &quot;Smalltown Boy&quot; reached #48 in the U.S. [[record chart|chart]] and peaked at #7 in Australia. The single featured vocals from session singer Kevin Glancy who would later be tried for fraud, before re-inventing himself as a Christian singer.

[[File:Bronski Beat - The Age of Consent Album Cover.jpg|thumb|right|The cover of ''The Age of Consent'']]

The follow-up single, &quot;[[Why? (Bronski Beat song)|Why?]]&quot;, while focusing on a Hi-NRG musical formula, was more lyrically focused on anti-homosexual [[prejudice]]. It also achieved [[Top 40|Top 10]] status in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], reaching #6,&lt;ref name=&quot;British Hit Singles &amp; Albums&quot;/&gt; and was a Top 10 hit for the band in Australia.

At the end of 1984, the trio released an album entitled ''[[The Age of Consent]]''. The inner sleeve listed the varying [[age of consent|ages of consent]] for consensual male [[homosexuality|homosexual]] activity in different nations around the world. At the time, the age of consent for sexual acts between men in the UK was 21 (compared with 16 for heterosexual acts). The album peaked at #4 in the [[UK Albums Chart]],&lt;ref name=&quot;British Hit Singles &amp; Albums&quot;/&gt; #36 in the U.S., and #12 in Australia.

A third single was released amid controversy{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} before Christmas 1984: a revival of &quot;[[It Ain't Necessarily So]]&quot;, the [[George Gershwin|George]] and [[Ira Gershwin]] classic (from ''[[Porgy and Bess]]'') which questions the authenticity of Biblical tales. It also reached the UK Top 20.&lt;ref name=&quot;British Hit Singles &amp; Albums&quot;/&gt;

In 1985, the trio joined up with [[Marc Almond]] to record a version of [[Donna Summer]]'s &quot;[[I Feel Love]]&quot;. The full version was actually a [[Medley (music)|medley]], also incorporating snippets of Summer's &quot;[[Love to Love You Baby (song)|Love to Love You Baby]]&quot; and [[John Leyton]]'s &quot;[[Johnny Remember Me]]&quot;. It was a success, reaching #3 in the UK,&lt;ref name=&quot;British Hit Singles &amp; Albums&quot;/&gt; equalling the chart achievement of &quot;Smalltown Boy&quot;. Although the original had been one of Marc Almond's all-time favourite songs, he had never read the [[lyrics]] and thus incorrectly sang &quot;What'll it be, what'll it be, you and me&quot; instead of &quot;Falling free, falling free, falling free&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

The band and their producer Mike Thorne had gone back into the studio in early 1985 to record a new single, &quot;Run From Love&quot;. PolyGram (London Records' parent company at that time) had pressed a number of promo singles and 12&quot; versions of the song, sending them out to both radio and record stores in the UK. However, the single was shelved as tensions in the band, both personal and political, resulted in Somerville leaving Bronski Beat in the summer of that year. &quot;Run From Love&quot; was subsequently released in a [[remix]] form on the Bronski Beat album ''[[Hundreds &amp; Thousands (album)|Hundreds &amp; Thousands]]'', a collection of mostly remixes (LP) and [[A-side and B-side|b-sides]] (as bonus tracks on the CD version) as well as the hit &quot;I Feel Love&quot;. Somerville went on to form [[Communards (band)|The Communards]] with [[Richard Coles]] while the remaining members of Bronski Beat searched for a new vocalist.

===Post Jimmy Somerville period===
Bronski Beat recruited [[John Foster (singer)|John Foster]] as Somerville's replacement. A single, &quot;[[Hit That Perfect Beat]]&quot;, was released in January 1986, reaching #3 in the UK.&lt;ref name=&quot;British Hit Singles &amp; Albums&quot;/&gt; It repeated this success in the Australian charts and was also featured in the [[film]], ''[[Letter to Brezhnev]]''. A second single, &quot;C'mon C'mon&quot;, also charted in the UK Top 20 and an album, ''[[Truthdare Doubledare]]'', released in May 1986, peaked at #18.&lt;ref name=&quot;British Hit Singles &amp; Albums&quot;/&gt; The film ''[[Parting Glances]]'' (1986) included Bronski Beat songs &quot;Love and Money&quot;, &quot;Smalltown Boy&quot; and &quot;Why?&quot;. During this period, the band teamed up with producer Mark Cunningham on the first-ever [[BBC]] [[Children In Need]] single, a cover of David Bowie's &quot;[[Heroes (David Bowie song)|Heroes]]&quot;, released in 1986 under the name of The County Line.

Foster left the band in 1987. Following Foster's departure, Bronski Beat began work on their next album, ''Out and About''. The tracks were recorded at Berry Street studios in London with engineer Brian Pugsley. Some of the song titles were &quot;The Final Spin&quot; and &quot;Peace And Love&quot;. The latter track featured [[Strawberry Switchblade]] vocalist Rose McDowell and appeared on several internet sites in 2006. One of the other songs from the project called &quot;European Boy&quot; was recorded in 1987 by disco group Splash. The leader singer of Splash was former [[Tight Fit]] singer Steve Grant. Steinbachek and Bronski toured extensively with the new material and got great reviews, however the project was abandoned as the group were dropped by London Records. Also in 1987, Bronski Beat and Somerville did a reunion concert for &quot;International AIDS Day&quot;, supported by [[New Order]], at the [[Brixton Academy]], London.

In 1989 [[Jonathan Hellyer]] became lead singer, and the band extensively toured the U.S. and Europe with back-up vocalist Annie Conway and had one minor hit with the song &quot;Cha Cha Heels&quot;, a one-off collaboration sung by [[United States|American]] [[actress]] and [[singer]] [[Eartha Kitt]]. The song was originally written for movie and recording star [[Divine (actor)|Divine]], who was unable to record the song before his death in 1988. 1990-91 saw Bronski Beat release three further singles on the Zomba record label, &quot;I'm Gonna Run Away&quot;, &quot;One More Chance&quot; and &quot;What More Can I Say&quot;. The singles were produced by Mike Thorne.

Foster and Bronski Beat teamed up again in 1994, and released a [[techno]] &quot;Tell Me Why '94&quot; and an [[acoustic music|acoustic]] &quot;Smalltown Boy '94&quot; on the [[Germany|German]] [[record label]], [[ZYX Music]]. The album ''Rainbow Nation'' was released the following year with Hellyer returning as lead vocalist, as Foster had dropped out of the project. Bronski Beat then dissolved with Steve Bronski going on to become a producer for other artists. Larry Steinbachek became the musical director for [[Michael Laub]]'s theater company, 'Remote Control Productions'.

In 2007 Bronski remixed the song &quot;Stranger To None&quot; by the UK [[alternative rock]] band, [[All Living Fear]]. Four different mixes were done, with one appearing on their retrospective album, ''Fifteen Years After''.

===Contemporary usage===
In 1998, the film ''[[Edge of Seventeen (film)|Edge of Seventeen]]'' used the songs &quot;Smalltown Boy&quot; and &quot;Why&quot;. In 2002, the US remake of ''[[Queer as Folk (North American TV series)|Queer as Folk]]'' used the song &quot;Smalltown Boy&quot; in an episode. In 2006 the signature keyboard riff from &quot;Smalltown Boy&quot; and part of the vocals from &quot;Why?&quot; were featured in the [[Supermode]] song &quot;Tell Me Why&quot;. The keyboard riff was used again in 2006, in the September song &quot;[[Cry for You (September song)|Cry for You]]&quot;. It is also heard on Daft Punk's &quot;Alive 2007&quot; Album in the track &quot;Too Long / Steam Machine&quot;. In 2008, &quot;Smalltown Boy&quot; was used in the sexual comedy ''[[Zack and Miri Make a Porno]]''. [[Gothic metal]] band [[Paradise Lost (band)|Paradise Lost]] also covered &quot;Smalltown Boy&quot; as a bonus track on the digi-pack version of the Symbol of Life album.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Bit and byte prefixes}}

In computing, a '''binary prefix''' is a specifier or mnemonic that is prepended to the [[Units of measurement|unit]]s of digital information, the [[bit]] and the [[byte]], to indicate multiplication by a [[Exponentiation|power]] of 2. In practice the powers used are multiples of 10, so the prefixes denote powers of 1024 = 2&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;.

The computer industry uses terms such as ''kilobyte'', ''megabyte'', and ''gigabyte'', and corresponding symbols KB, MB, and GB, in two different ways. In citations of main memory or RAM capacity,  ''gigabyte'' customarily means {{gaps|1|073|741|824}} bytes. This is a [[power of 2]], specifically 2&lt;sup&gt;30&lt;/sup&gt;, therefore this usage is referred to as a binary unit or binary prefix.

In other contexts, the industry traditionally uses ''kilo'', ''mega'', ''giga'', etc., in a manner consistent with their meaning in the [[International System of Units]] (SI): as powers of 1000.  For example, a 500 gigabyte hard drive holds {{gaps|500|000|000|000}} bytes, and a 100 megabit per second Ethernet connection transfers data at {{gaps|100|000|000}} bit/s.

Starting in about 1998, a number of standards and trade organizations approved standards and recommendations for a new set of binary prefixes, proposed earlier by the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] (IEC), that would refer unambiguously to powers of 1024.
According to these, the [[SI prefix]]es would only be used in the decimal sense, even when referring to data storage capacities: [[kilobyte]] and [[megabyte]] would denote one thousand bytes and one million bytes respectively (consistent with SI), while new terms such as [[kibibyte]], [[mebibyte]] and [[gibibyte]],
abbreviated KiB, MiB, and GiB, would denote 1024 bytes, {{gaps|1|048|576}} bytes, and {{gaps|1|073|741|824}} bytes respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;NIST-biprefix&quot;/&gt; However, as of 2011 adoption has been slow and usage has been limited in the marketplace and in the press.

==History==
{{See also|Timeline of binary prefixes}}

===Main memory===
Early computers used one of two addressing methods to access the system memory; binary (base-2) or decimal (base-10).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
|quote = Of 187 different relevant systems, 131 utilize a straight binary system internally, whereas 53 utilize the decimal system (primarily binary coded decimal) and 3 systems utilize a binary coded alphanumeric system of notation.
|journal = Ballistic Research Laboratories Report No. 1115
|month = March
|year = 1961
|pages = 1027
|url = http://ed-thelen.org/comp-hist/BRL61analysis.html#STORAGE
}} This lengthy report describes many of the early computers.&lt;/ref&gt;
For example, the [[IBM 701]] (1952) used binary and could address 2048 36-[[bit]] [[Word (data type)|words]], while the [[IBM 702]] (1953) used decimal and could address {{gaps|10|000}} 7-bit words.

By the mid 1960s, binary addressing had become the standard architecture in most computer designs, and main memory sizes were most commonly powers of two.
This is the most natural configuration for memory,
as all combinations of their address lines map to a valid address,
allowing easy aggregation into a larger block of memory with contiguous addresses.

Early computer system documentation would specify the memory size with an exact number such as 4096, 8192, or 16384 words of storage.
These are all [[powers of 2]], and furthermore are small multiples of 2&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;,
or 1024.
As storage capacities increased, several different methods were developed to abbreviate these quantities.

The method most commonly used today uses  prefixes such as  kilo, mega, giga, and corresponding symbols K, M, and G, 
which the computer industry originally adopted from the [[metric system]]. 
Kilo and mega, meaning 1000 and {{gaps|1|000|000}} respectively,
were commonly used in the electronics industry before World War II.&lt;ref&gt;Hunting Trouble on 28 Megacycles, A. L. Blais, QST, January 1930.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Along with giga or G, meaning  {{gaps|1|000|000|000}}, they are now known as [[SI prefixes]]&lt;ref group=&quot;defn.&quot; name=&quot;d.SIp&quot;/&gt; after the [[International System of Units]] (SI), introduced in 1960 to formalize aspects of the metric system.

The International System of Units does not define units for digital information but notes that the SI prefixes may be applied outside the contexts where base units or derived units would be used. But as computer main memory in a binary-addressed system is manufactured in sizes that were easily expressed as multiples of 1024, ''kilobyte'', when applied to computer memory, came to be used to mean 1024 bytes instead of 1000.

The use of K in the binary sense as in a &quot;32K core&quot; meaning 32×1024, or {{gaps|32|768}}, can be found as early as 1959.&lt;ref

Thus the first binary prefix was born.&lt;ref group=&quot;defn.&quot; name=&quot;d.binpref&quot;/&gt;

Another style was to truncate the last 3 digits and append K, essentially using K as a
decimal prefix&lt;ref group=&quot;defn.&quot; name=&quot;d.decpref&quot;/&gt; in accordance with [[SI prefixes|SI]],
but always truncating to the next lower whole number instead of rounding to the nearest.
The exact values {{gaps|32|768}}, {{gaps|65|536}} and {{gaps|131|072}} would then be described as 32K, 65K and 131K.&lt;ref

This style was used from about 1965 to 1975.

These two styles (K = 1024 and truncation) were used loosely around the same time, sometimes by the same company. In discussions of binary-addressed memories, the exact size was evident from context. (For memory sizes of 32K and below, there is no difference between the two styles.) The [[HP 2100|HP 21MX]] real-time computer (1974) denoted {{gaps|196|608}} (which is 192×1024) as 196K and {{gaps|1|048|576}} as 1M,&lt;ref

The &quot;truncation&quot; method gradually waned.
Capitalization of the letter K became the ''de facto'' standard for binary notation, although this could not be extended to higher powers.
Nevertheless, the practice of using the SI-inspired &quot;kilo&quot; to indicate 1024 was later extended to &quot;megabyte&quot; meaning 1024&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ({{gaps|1|048|576}}) bytes, and later &quot;gigabyte&quot; for 1024&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; ({{gaps|1|073|741|824}}) bytes.
For example, a &quot;512&amp;nbsp;megabyte&quot; RAM module is 512×1024&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; bytes
(512×{{gaps|1|048|576}}, or {{gaps|536|870|912}}), rather than {{gaps|512|000|000}}.

The symbols Kbit, Kbyte, Mbit and Mbyte started to be used as &quot;binary units&quot;—&quot;bit&quot; or &quot;byte&quot; with a multiplier that is a power of 1024—in the early 1970s.&lt;ref

For a time, memory capacities were often expressed in K, even when M could have been used: The IBM System/370 Model 158 brochure (1972) had the following: &quot;Real storage capacity is available in 512K increments ranging from 512K to 2,048K bytes.&quot;&lt;ref

Megabyte was used to describe the 22-bit addressing of DEC [[PDP-11]]/70 (1975)&lt;ref

and gigabyte the 30-bit addressing DEC [[VAX-11/780]] (1977).

===Disk drives===
The disk drive industry followed a different pattern.
Industry practice, more thoroughly documented at [[Timeline of binary prefixes]] and continuing today,
is to specify hard drives using SI prefixes and symbols in their SI or &quot;decimal&quot; interpretation.
Unlike binary-addressed computer main memory,
there is nothing in a disk drive that influences it to have a total capacity easily expressed using a power of 1024.
The first commercially sold disk drive, the [[IBM 350]], had 50 (not 32 or 64) physical disk &quot;platters&quot;
containing a total of 50,000 sectors of 100 characters each, for a total quoted capacity of &quot;5 million characters.&quot;&lt;ref
&quot;name=ibm350&quot;&gt;{{Cite web
|url=http://www-03.ibm.com/ibm/history/exhibits/storage/storage_350.html
|work=IBM Archives
|title=IBM 350 disk storage unit
|author=IBM Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It was introduced in September 1956.

In the 1960s most disk drives used IBM's variable block length format (called [[Count Key Data]] or &quot;CKD&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;IBM invented the disk drive in 1956 and until the late 1960s its drives and their clones were dominant. See, e.g. [http://www.hagley.lib.de.us/1980.htm US vs. IBM antitrust litigation (Jan 1969)], especially IBM analyses of Memorex and other disk drive companies.&lt;/ref&gt;
Any block size could be specified up to the maximum track length.  Since the block headers occupied space, the usable capacity of the drive was dependent on the block size.  Blocks (&quot;records&quot; in IBM's terminology) of 88, 96, 880 and 960 were often used because they related to the fixed block size of punch cards. The drive capacity was usually stated under conditions of full track record blocking. For example, the 100 megabyte 3336 disk pack only achieved that capacity with a full track block size of 13,030 bytes.  

Hard disk drive manufacturers used &quot;megabytes&quot; or &quot;MB&quot;, meaning 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; bytes, to characterize their products as early as 1974.&lt;ref&gt;The [http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/cdc/discs/brochures/ProductLine_Oct74.pdf|CDC Product Line Card] unambiguously uses MB to characterize HDD capacity in millions of bytes&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1977, in its first edition, Disk/Trend, a leading hard disk drive industry marketing consultancy segmented the industry according to MBs (decimal sense) of capacity.&lt;ref&gt;1977 Disk/Trend Report - Rigid Disk Drives, published June 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the earliest hard disk drives in personal computing history,
the Seagate [[ST-412]], was specified as &quot;Formatted: 10.0 Megabytes&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;ST506/412 OEM Manual, Seagate Corp. April 1982, para. 1.2&lt;/ref&gt;  The specification of 4 heads or active surfaces (tracks per cylinder), 306  cylinders and when formatted with a sector size of 256 bytes and 32 sectors/track results in a capacity of {{gaps|10|027|008}} bytes. With the customary binary prefixes,&lt;ref group=&quot;defn.&quot; name=&quot;d.cbp&quot;/&gt; this is expressed as 9.5625 mebibytes. This drive was one of several types installed into the [[IBM PC/XT]] &lt;ref&gt;IBM Tells MiniScribe It Is Cutting Back On Winchester Orders, Computer System News, Jan 1, 1984, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; and extensively advertised and reported as a &quot;10 MB&quot; (formatted) hard disk drive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/04/06/oldest_seagate_drive_in_uk/ It's the oldest working Seagate drive in the UK]&lt;/ref&gt;

The hard drive industry continues to use decimal prefixes for drive capacity. Today, for example, a &quot;300&amp;nbsp;GB&quot; hard drive offers slightly more than 300×10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;, or {{gaps|300|000|000|000}}, bytes, not 300×2&lt;sup&gt;30&lt;/sup&gt; (which would be about 322×10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;).  Operating systems such as [[Microsoft Windows]] that display hard drive sizes using the customary binary prefix &quot;GB&quot; (as it is used for RAM) would display this as 279.4&amp;nbsp;GB (meaning 279.4×1024&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, or 279.4×{{gaps|1|073|741|824}}).  

However, other usages still occur. For example, in one document, Seagate specifies data transfer rates of some of its hard drives in ''both'' IEC and decimal units.&lt;ref name=savvio&gt;
[http://www.seagate.com/staticfiles/support/docs/manual/enterprise/savvio/10K.5/100628561d.pdf Seagate Savvio 10K.5 SAS Product Manual], 100628561, Rev D, March 2011, sec 5.2.3, p. 10 (18th page of the pdf), states the drive's sustained transfer speed as &quot;89 to 160 [[MiB]]/s&quot; on one line, and &quot;93 to 168 MB/s&quot; on the next line.&lt;/ref&gt; 
&quot;Advanced Format&quot; drives using 4096-byte sectors are described as having &quot;4K sectors.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Seagate marketing bulletin, [http://www.seagate.com/docs/pdf/whitepaper/mb604_4k_transition_faq.pdf Advanced Format 4K Sector Transition]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Information transfer and clock rates===
Like the hard drive, there is nothing in a computer [[Clock signal|clock]] circuit or data transfer path that demands or even encourages that things happen at rates easily expressed using powers of 1024, or even using powers of 2.

Computer [[Clock signal|clock]] frequencies are always quoted using SI prefixes in their decimal sense. For example, the internal clock frequency of the original [[IBM PC]] was 4.77&amp;nbsp;MHz, that is, {{gaps|4|770|000}} Hz. &lt;!-- As a particularly &quot;odd&quot; example, some early microcomputer chips used the very widely available (and therefore inexpensive) [[NTSC]] [[colorburst]] crystal for their clock, resulting in a clock frequency of {{gaps|3|579|545|Hz}}. CN for this --&gt;

Similarly, digital information transfer rates are mostly quoted using decimal prefixes:
* The ATA-100 disk interface refers to {{gaps|100|000|000|bytes/s}}
* 1x CD-ROM CD-ROM speed is 150K or {{gaps|150|000|bytes/s}}
* A &quot;56K&quot; modem refers to {{gaps|56|000|bits/s}}
* SATA-2 has a raw bit rate of 3 Gbit/s = {{gaps|3|000|000|000|bits/s}}
* PC2-6400 ram transfers {{gaps|6|400|000|000|bytes/s}}
* Firewire 800 has a raw rate of {{gaps|800|000|000|bits/s}}
* As of 2011, Seagate specifies the transfer speed of some hard disk drives with IEC binary prefixes as well as decimal.&lt;ref name=savvio/&gt;

===Standardization of dual definitions===
By the mid 1970s it was common to see K meaning 1024 and the occasional M meaning {{gaps|1|048|576}} for words or bytes of main memory (RAM) while K and M were commonly used with their decimal meaning for disk storage.
In the 1980s, as capacities of both types of devices increased,
the SI prefix G, with SI meaning, was commonly applied to disk storage, while M in its binary meaning, became common for computer memory. In the 1990s, the prefix G, in its binary meaning, became commonly used for computer memory capacity. The first terabyte (SI prefix, {{gaps|1|000|000|000|000}} bytes) hard disk drive was introduced in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

The dual usage of the kilo, mega, and giga prefixes and their corresponding symbols K, M, and G as both powers of 1000 and powers of 1024 was recorded in standards and dictionaries. For example, the 1986 ANSI/IEEE Std 1084-1986&lt;ref

The units Kbyte, Mbyte, and Gbyte are found in the trade press and in IEEE journals. Gigabyte was formally defined in IEEE Std 610.10-1994 as either {{gaps|1|000|000|000}} or 2&lt;sup&gt;30&lt;/sup&gt; bytes.&lt;ref

The hardware industry has coped with the dual definitions because of relative consistency:
system memory (RAM) typically uses the binary meaning while magnetic disk storage uses the SI meaning.
There are, however, exceptions and special cases.
[[Diskette]]s use yet another &quot;megabyte&quot; equal to 1024×1000 bytes.&lt;ref
 name=&quot;Microsoft 121839&quot;/&gt;
In optical disks, [[Compact Disk]]s use MB to mean 1024&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; bytes while [[DVD]]s use GB to mean 1000&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; bytes.&lt;ref name=&quot;cdromcap&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;dvdcap&quot;/&gt;

==Inconsistent use of units==
===Deviation between powers of 1024 and powers of 1000===
Computer storage has become cheaper per unit and thereby larger, by many orders of magnitude since &quot;K&quot; was first used to mean 1024. 
Because both the SI and &quot;binary&quot; meanings of kilo, mega, etc., are based on [[Exponentiation|powers]] of 1000 or 1024 rather than simple multiples, the difference between 1M &quot;binary&quot; and 1M &quot;decimal&quot; is proportionally larger than that between 1K &quot;binary&quot; and 1k &quot;decimal,&quot; and so on up the scale.
The relative difference between the values in the binary and decimal interpretations increases, when using the SI prefixes as the base, from 2.4% for kilo to over 20% for the yotta prefix.

===Consumer confusion===
In the early days of computers there was little or no consumer confusion because of the sophisticated nature of the consumers and the practice of computer manufacturers to specify their products with capacities in full precision.
For example, in 1965 IBM stated about the System/360 Model 75 that &quot;Its main memory operated at 750 nanoseconds and was available in three sizes up to 1,048,576 characters of information.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-03.ibm.com/ibm/history/exhibits/mainframe/mainframe_PP2075.html System/360 Model 75]&lt;/ref&gt;

One source of consumer confusion is the difference in the way many operating systems display hard drive sizes, compared to the way hard drive manufacturers describe them.
As noted previously, hard drives are described and sold using &quot;GB&quot; or &quot;TB&quot; in their SI meaning: one billion and one trillion bytes.
Many current operating systems and other software however display hard drive and file sizes using &quot;MB&quot;, &quot;GB&quot; or other SI-looking prefixes in their &quot;binary&quot; meaning, just as they do for displays of RAM capacity.
(This is fairly recent. The presentation of hard disk drive capacity by an operating system using &quot;MB&quot; in a binary sense appears no earlier than [[Macintosh Finder]] after 1984. Prior to that, on the systems that had a hard disk drive, capacity was presented in decimal digits with no prefix of any sort (e.g., MS/PC DOS [[CHKDSK]] command).)

The following three images show the discrepancy of reporting the identical disk capacity on the manufacturer's packaging (160 GB = 160×1000&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), the [[Windows XP]] disk manager (149.05 GB = 149.05×1024&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;),
and the drive properties display ({{gaps|152|625|MB}} = {{gaps|152|625}}×1024&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).

&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Seagate 160 GB hard drive box.jpg|Disk drive packaging specifies a disk capacity of 160×10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; bytes using standard [[SI prefix]]es.
Image:Windows XP Disk management for 160 GB disk.png|Windows XP disk management application lists the capacity of a 160×10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; byte disk drive as 149.05 GB
Image:Windows XP Drive Properties for 160 GB disk.png|Windows XP drive properties display lists the capacity of a 160×10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; byte disk drive as 152625 MB.
&lt;/gallery&gt;

&lt;!--- it would be nice to have a screen cap of Windows' drive properties display in which they list the capacity of this same drive as 160,xxx,yyy,zzz bytes.. spelled out to the last byte... as demo that Windows does
know how large the drive really is. However we need to either have a sample of exactly the same drive, or start over
and make four new images all of a new drive. ---&gt;

===Legal disputes===
The different interpretations of disk size prefixes has led to three significant class action lawsuits against digital storage manufacturers.
One case involved flash memory and the other two involved hard disk drives.
Both were settled with the manufactures admitting no wrongdoing but agreeing to clarify the storage capacity of their products on the consumer packaging.
Flash memory and hard disk manufacturers now have disclaimers on their packaging and web sites clarifying the formatted capacity of the devices&lt;ref name=&quot;sd-cap-disclaimer&quot;/&gt;
or defining MB as 1 million bytes and 1 GB as 1 billion bytes.&lt;ref name=&quot;wdc-CaviarSE16&quot;&gt;{{Cite web

Vroegh claimed that a 256 MB Flash Memory Device had only 244 MB of accessible memory. &quot;Plaintiffs allege that Defendants marketed the memory capacity of their products by assuming that one megabyte equals one million bytes and one gigabyte equals one billion bytes.&quot;
The plaintiffs wanted the defendants to use the traditional values of 1024&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; for megabyte and 1024&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; for gigabyte.
The plaintiffs acknowledged that the IEC and IEEE standards define a MB as one million bytes but stated that the industry has largely ignored the IEC standards.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vreogh-3rd&quot;&gt;{{Cite web

==Unique binary prefixes==
===Early suggestions===

While early computer scientists typically used k to mean 1000, some recognized the convenience that would result from working with multiples of 1024 and the confusion that resulted from using the same prefixes for two different meanings.

Several proposals for unique binary prefixes&lt;ref
group=&quot;defn.&quot; name=&quot;d.binpref&quot;&gt;A '''binary prefix''' is a prefix that denotes a power of 1024.
For example, in the computer industry's customary practice,
one &quot;megabyte&quot; of RAM is 1024&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; bytes of RAM,
one &quot;gigabyte&quot; of RAM is 1024&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; bytes of RAM, and so on.
In the IEC system, these would be expressed as one &quot;mebibyte&quot; and one &quot;gibibyte,&quot; respectively.
Both are &quot;binary prefixes&quot; in these usages.&lt;/ref&gt;
were made in 1968.
Donald Morrison proposed to use the Greek letter kappa ([[κ]]) to denote 1024, κ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; to denote 1024×1024, and so on.&lt;ref
name=&quot;Morrison&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal

(At the time, memory size was small, and only K was in widespread use.)
[[Wallace Givens]] responded with a proposal to use bK as an abbreviation for 1024 and bK2 or bK&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; for 1024×1024, though he noted that neither the Greek letter nor lowercase letter b would be easy to reproduce on computer printers of the day.&lt;ref name=&quot;Givens&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal

[[Bruce A. Martin]] further proposed that the prefixes be abandoned altogether, and the letter B be used as a binary exponent, similar to [[Scientific notation#E notation|E notation]], to create shorthands like 3B20 for 3×2&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref

None of these gained much acceptance, and capitalization of the letter K became the ''de facto'' standard for indicating a factor of 1024 instead of 1000, although this could not be extended to higher powers.

As the discrepancy between the two systems increased in the higher order powers, more proposals for unique prefixes were made.
In 1996, [[Markus Kuhn]] proposed a system with ''di'' prefixes, like the &quot;dikilobyte&quot; (K₂B or K2B).&lt;ref name=&quot;Kuhn&quot;&gt;{{Cite web

===IEC prefixes===
The set of binary prefixes that were eventually adopted, now referred to as the
&quot;IEC prefixes,&quot;&lt;ref group=&quot;defn.&quot; name=&quot;d.iecpref&quot;&gt;The term '''IEC binary prefix''' or '''IEC prefix''' refers to the prefixes such as kibi, mebi, gibi, etc., or their corresponding symbols Ki, Mi, Gi, etc., first adopted by the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] (IEC). Such prefixes are only used with the units bits or bytes (or compound units derived from them such as bytes/second) and always denote powers of 1024; that is, they are always used as binary prefixes. Thus 1 mebibyte of RAM is 1024&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; bytes of RAM, 1 gibibyte or 1 GiB of RAM is 1024&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; bytes, and so on.&lt;/ref&gt; were first proposed by the
[[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]]'s (IUPAC) Interdivisional Committee on Nomenclature and Symbols (IDCNS) in 1995. At that time, it was proposed that the terms kilobyte and megabyte be used only for 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; bytes and 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; bytes, respectively. The new prefixes ''kibi'' (kilobinary), ''mebi'' (megabinary) and ''gibi'' (gigabinary) were also proposed at the time, and the proposed symbols for the prefixes were kb, Mb and Gb respectively, rather than Ki, Mi and Gi.&lt;ref name=&quot;iucr-95&quot;&gt;http://ww1.iucr.org/cexec/rep95/idcns.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The proposal was not accepted at the time.

{{anchor|IEC standard prefixes}}

The [[Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers]] (IEEE) began to collaborate with the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) and [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] (IEC) to find acceptable names for binary prefixes. The IEC proposed ''kibi'', ''mebi'', ''gibi'' and ''tebi'', with the symbols Ki, Mi, Gi and Ti respectively, in 1996.&lt;ref name=&quot;iucr-96&quot;&gt;[http://www.chester.iucr.org/iucr-top/cexec/rep96/idcns.htm 1996 IUCr IUPAC Interdivisional Committee on Nomenclature and Symbols (IDCNS) report]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- the preceding reference is weak as it merely consists of IUPAC noting IEC's proposal, but it is apparently the only thing we have. would be better to have a ref for the actual proposal --&gt;

The names for the new prefixes are derived from the original SI prefixes combined with the term ''binary'', but contracted, by taking the first two letters of the SI prefix and 'bi' from binary. The first letter of each such prefix is therefore identical to the corresponding SI prefixes, except for &quot;K&quot;, which is used interchangeably with &quot;k&quot;, whereas in SI, only the lower-case k represents 1000.

The IEEE decided that their standards would use the prefixes ''kilo'', etc. with their metric definitions, but allowed the binary definitions to be used in an interim period as long as such usage was explicitly pointed out on a case-by-case basis.&lt;ref name=&quot;ieee-standards&quot;&gt;Bruce Barrow, &quot;A Lesson in Megabytes,&quot; ''IEEE Standards Bearer'', January 1997, page 5&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adoption by IEC and NIST===
In January 1999, the IEC published the first international standard (IEC 60027-2 Amendment 2) with the new prefixes, extended up to ''pebi'' (Pi) and ''exbi'' (Ei).&lt;ref&gt;&quot;These prefixes for binary multiples, which were developed by IEC Technical Committee (TC) 25, Quantities and units, and their letter symbols, with the strong support of the International Committee for Weights and Measures (CIPM) and the IEEE, were adopted by the IEC as Amendment 2 to IEC International Standard IEC 60027-2: Letter symbols to be used in electrical technology - Part 2: Telecommunications and electronics.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--- the preceding reference really needs more than just a quote. From what is it quoting? ---&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;iucr-99&quot;&gt;[http://journals.iucr.org/a/issues/2000/06/00/es0288/es0288bdy.html#SEC15.1 IUCR 1999 report on IUPAC Interdivisional Committee on Nomenclature and Symbols]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--- this reference is weak as it merely consists of the International Union of Crystallography reporting on IUPAC's reporting on the IEC standard(!) ---&gt;

The IEC 60027-2 Amendment 2 also states that the IEC position is the same as that of BIPM (the body that regulates the SI system); the SI prefixes retain their definitions in powers of 1000 and are never used to mean a power of 1024.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

In usage, products and concepts typically described using powers of 1024 would continue to be, but with the new IEC prefixes. For example, a memory module of {{gaps|536|870|912}} bytes (512×{{gaps|1|048|576}}) would be referred to as 512&amp;nbsp;MiB or 512&amp;nbsp;mebibytes instead of 512&amp;nbsp;MB or 512&amp;nbsp;megabytes. Conversely, since hard drives have historically been marketed using the SI convention that &quot;giga&quot; means {{gaps|1|000|000|000}}, a &quot;500&amp;nbsp;GB&quot; hard drive would still be labeled as such. According to these recommendations, operating systems and other software would also use binary and SI prefixes in the same way, so the purchaser of a &quot;500&amp;nbsp;GB&quot; hard drive would find the operating system reporting either &quot;500&amp;nbsp;GB&quot; or &quot;466&amp;nbsp;GiB&quot;, while {{gaps|536|870|912}} bytes of RAM would be displayed as &quot;512&amp;nbsp;MiB&quot;.

name=&quot;iec-2000&quot;&gt;IEC 60027-2 (2000-11) Ed. 2.0

===Other standards bodies and organizations===
The IEC-proposed binary prefixes are now supported by other standardization bodies and technical organizations.

The United States [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) supports the ISO/IEC standards for
&quot;Prefixes for binary multiples&quot; and has a [http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/binary.html web site] documenting them,
describing and justifying their use. NIST suggests that in English, the first syllable of the name of the binary-multiple prefix should be pronounced in the same way as the first syllable of the name of the corresponding SI prefix, and that the second syllable should be pronounced as ''bee''.&lt;ref name=&quot;NIST-biprefix&quot;&gt;{{Cite web

In December 2002, [[JEDEC]], a leading standards organization in the microelectronics industry, mentioned the IEC prefixes in their ''Terms, Definitions, and Letter Symbols for Microcomputers, Microprocessors, and Memory Integrated Circuits'' document.
This document defines &quot;kilo,&quot; &quot;mega,&quot; and &quot;giga&quot; with binary multipliers.
A &quot;Note&quot; to this definition then states that that definition is only presented &quot;to reflect common usage&quot;, and quotes the IEC in describing the binary prefixes as &quot;an alternative system&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;JEDEC-terms&quot;&gt;

|quote=[Side note:] These SI prefixes refer strictly to powers of 10. They should not be used to indicate powers of 2 (for example, one kilobit represents 1000 bits and not 1024 bits). The IEC has adopted prefixes for binary powers in the international standard IEC 60027-2: 2005, third edition, ''Letter symbols to be used in electrical technology — Part 2: Telecommunications and electronics''. The names and symbols for the prefixes corresponding to 2&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;, 2&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;, 2&lt;sup&gt;30&lt;/sup&gt;, 2&lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;, 2&lt;sup&gt;50&lt;/sup&gt;, and 2&lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt; are, respectively: kibi, Ki; mebi, Mi; gibi, Gi; tebi, Ti; pebi, Pi; and exbi, Ei. Thus, for example, one kibibyte would be written: 1 KiB = 2&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; B = 1024 B, where B denotes a byte. Although these prefixes are not part of the SI, they should be used in the field of information technology to avoid the incorrect usage of the SI prefixes.

The [[Society of Automobile Engineers|Society of Automotive Engineers]] (SAE) prohibits the use of SI prefixes with anything but a power-of-1000 meaning, but does not recommend or otherwise cite the IEC binary prefixes.&lt;ref name=&quot;SAE&quot;&gt;

===Dissent===
Even among proponents of unique prefixes for binary multiples, proposals for alternative sets of prefixes have continued following the introduction of Ki, Mi, etc., by the IEC. For example, [[Donald Knuth]], who uses decimal notation like 1 MB = 1000 kB,&lt;ref name=&quot;Knuth&quot;&gt;''[http://www-cs-staff.stanford.edu/~knuth/fasc1.ps.gz The Art of Computer Programming]'' Volume 1, [[Donald Knuth]], pp. 24 and 94&lt;/ref&gt; expressed &quot;astonishment&quot; that the IEC proposal was adopted, calling them &quot;funny-sounding&quot; and opining that proponents were assuming &quot;that standards are automatically adopted just because they are there.&quot; Knuth proposed that the powers of 1024 be designated as &quot;large kilobytes&quot; and &quot;large megabytes&quot; (abbreviated KKB and MMB, as &quot;doubling the letter connotes both binary-ness and large-ness&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;Knuth-webpage&quot;&gt;[http://www-cs-staff.stanford.edu/~knuth/news99.html Knuth: Recent News (1999)]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[SI_prefix#Other_and_obsolete_prefixes|Double prefixes]] were already abolished from SI, however, having a multiplicative meaning (&quot;MMB&quot; would be equivalent to &quot;TB&quot;), and this proposed usage never gained any traction.

==Current practice==
Most computer hardware uses [[SI prefixes]]&lt;ref group=&quot;defn.&quot; name=&quot;d.SIp&quot;/&gt; to state capacity and define other performance parameters such as data rate.  [[Main memory|Main]] and [[cache memory|cache]] memories are notable exceptions.

[[Main memory]] and [[cache memory]] universally use customary binary prefixes&lt;ref group=&quot;defn.&quot; name=&quot;d.cbp&quot;&gt;As used in this article, the term '''customary binary prefix''' or similar refers to prefixes such as kilo, mega, giga, etc., borrowed from the similarly named [[SI prefix]]es but commonly used to denote a power of 1024.&lt;/ref&gt; to state capacity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://welcome.hp.com/country/us/en/welcome.html Hewlett-Packard]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dell.com/ Dell], [http://www.sonystyle.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/CategoryDisplay?catalogId=10551&amp;storeId=10151&amp;langId=-1&amp;categoryId=16155&amp;SR=nav:shop:computers:desktops:ss&amp;ref=http%3A//www.sony.com/index.php Sony]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apple.com/mac/ Apple Inc.], [http://explore.toshiba.com/laptops Toshiba]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gateway.com/systems/category/529598023.php Gateway]&lt;br&gt;[http://www.sun.com/desktop/index.jsp Sun Microsystems]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.4allmemory.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.rdram_rambus_pc1066 4AllMemory.com]&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, [[flash memory]] as for example in solid state drives, uses [[SI prefixes]]&lt;ref group=&quot;defn.&quot; name=&quot;d.SIp&quot;/&gt; to state capacity.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

With a few exceptions, most operating systems and other software continue to use the customary binary prefixes in displays of memory, disk storage capacity, and file size,
but SI prefixes&lt;ref group=&quot;defn.&quot; name=&quot;d.SIp&quot;&gt;The term '''SI prefix''' or similar refers to prefixes such as kilo, mega, giga, etc., defined by the [[International System of Units|SI system]] of units and ''always'' used to denote a power of 1000; in other words, always as decimal prefixes.&lt;/ref&gt;
in other areas such as network communication speeds and processor speeds.

Nearly all articles, papers, and marketing materials in the industry continue to use the customary binary prefixes when referring to computer memory, even those published under the aegis of organizations that have shown support for the IEC prefixes.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

In the following subsections, unless otherwise noted, examples are first given using the common prefixes used in each case, and then followed by interpretation using other notation where appropriate.

===Operating Systems===
Prior to the release of [[Mac OS#&quot;Classic&quot; Mac OS (1984–2001)|Macintosh System Software]] (1984), file sizes were typically reported by the operating system without any prefixes.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} Today, most operating systems report file sizes with prefixes.

===Software===
{{As of|February 2010}}, most software does not distinguish symbols for binary and decimal prefixes.&lt;ref group=&quot;defn.&quot; name=&quot;d.decpref&quot;&gt;A '''decimal prefix''' is a prefix that denotes a [[Exponentiation|power]] of 1000. For example, &quot;kilo&quot; denotes 1000, &quot;mega&quot; denotes 1000&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; or one million, &quot;giga&quot; denotes 1000&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; or one billion, and so on. SI prefixes are decimal prefixes.&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] binary naming convention has been adopted by a few, but this is not used universally.

One of the stated goals of the introduction of the IEC prefixes was &quot;to preserve the SI prefixes as unambiguous decimal multipliers.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;IEEE1541&quot;/&gt; Programs such as [[fdisk]]/[[cfdisk]], [[parted]], and [[apt-get]] use SI prefixes with their decimal meaning.

&lt;gallery perrow=&quot;6&quot;&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Computer hardware===
{{As of|February 2010}}, ''no'' examples of hardware marketed using IEC binary prefixes have been found.
Even hardware types that use powers-of-1024 multipliers, such as memory, continue to be marketed with
customary binary prefixes.

====Computer memory====
[[Image:Memory module DDRAM 20-03-2006.jpg|thumb|The 536,870,912 byte (512×2&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;) capacity of these RAM modules is stated as &quot;512 MB&quot; on the label.]]

Measurements of most types of electronic '''[[computer memory|memory]]''' such as [[Random Access Memory|RAM]], [[Read-only memory|ROM]] are given using customary binary prefixes (kilo, mega, and giga).  This includes some [[Flash memory]], like [[EEPROM]]s.
For example, a &quot;512 megabyte&quot; memory module is 512×2&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt; bytes (512×{{gaps|1|048|576}}, or {{gaps|536|870|912}}).

JEDEC Solid State Technology Association, the semiconductor engineering standardization body of the Electronic Industries Alliance (EIA), continues to include the customary binary definitions of kilo, mega and giga in their ''Terms, Definitions, and Letter Symbols'' document,&lt;ref name=&quot;JEDEC-terms&quot;/&gt;
and uses those definitions in later memory standards&lt;ref name=&quot;JEDEC-ddr3&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;JEDEC-ddr2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;JEDEC-configs&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;JEDEC-configs-toc&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;JEDEC-configs-terms&quot;/&gt;
(See also [[JEDEC memory standards]].)

Many computer programming tasks reference memory in terms of [[powers of two]] because of the inherent binary design of current hardware addressing systems. For example, a 16-bit processor register can reference at most 65,536 items (bytes, words, or other objects); this is conveniently expressed as &quot;64K&quot; items.  An operating system might map memory as 4096-byte [[Page (computing)|pages]], in which case exactly 8192 pages could be allocated within {{gaps|33|554|432|bytes}} of memory: 8K (8192) pages of 4 kilobytes (4096) each within 32 megabytes (32 MiB) of memory.

====Hard disk drives====
All [[hard disk]] drive manufacturers state capacity using [[SI prefixes]].&lt;ref group=&quot;defn.&quot; name=&quot;d.SIp&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;i.e. see [http://www.hitachigst.com/tech/techlib.nsf/techdocs/B259B4A73296DA628625751600058A80/$file/ProductBrochureMarch2009.pdf HGST], [http://www.samsung.com/global/business/hdd/faqView.do?b2b_bbs_msg_id=167 Samsung], [http://www.seagate.com/docs/pdf/whitepaper/storage_solutions_guide.pdf Seagate], [http://sdd.toshiba.com/techdocs/MKxx33GSG_MK1235GSL_r1.pdf Toshiba] and [http://www.wdc.com/en/library/2579-001028.pdf Western Digital] websites&lt;/ref&gt;

====Flash drives====
[[USB flash drive]]s, flash-based memory cards like [[CompactFlash]] or [[Secure Digital]], and flash-based [[Solid-state drive|SSDs]] use [[SI prefixes]];&lt;ref group=&quot;defn.&quot; name=&quot;d.SIp&quot;/&gt;
for example, a &quot;256 MB&quot; flash card provides at least 256 million bytes ({{gaps|256|000|000}}), not 256×1024×1024 ({{gaps|268|435|456}}).&lt;ref name=&quot;sd-cap-disclaimer&quot;&gt;{{Cite web
  | url = http://www.sandisk.com/Assets/Categories/Products/sd_capacitydisclaimer.pdf
  | title = Secure Digital Capacity Disclaimer
  | format = PDF
  | work = sandisk.com
  | publisher = [[SanDisk|SanDisk Corporation]]
  | accessdate = 2007-09-09
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
These devices usually physically contain the binary capacities, but some space is reserved for internal functions of the flash drive. In other words, there are physically 256×1024×1024  bytes of storage on a typical &quot;256MB&quot; flash drive, but some space is needed for functions like [[wear leveling]]. In the case of a &quot;256MB&quot; flash drive, the manufacturer can allocate approximately 12MB to internal functions, and still provide 256 million usable bytes.

====Floppy drives====
[[Floppy disk]]s have existed in numerous physical and logical [[List of floppy disk formats|formats]], and have been sized inconsistently.  In part, this is because the end user capacity of a particular disk is a function of the controller hardware, so that the same disk could be formatted to a variety of capacities.  In many cases, the media are marketed without any indication of the end user capacity, as for example, DSDD, meaning double-sided double-density.

The last widely adopted diskette was the 3½ inch high density. This has a formatted capacity of {{gaps|1|474|560}} bytes or 1440&amp;nbsp;KB (1440×1024, using &quot;KB&quot; in the customary binary sense). These are marketed as &quot;HD&quot;, or &quot;1.44&amp;nbsp;MB&quot; or both.
This case defines a &quot;third megabyte&quot; of 1000×1024.

Most operating systems display the capacity using &quot;MB&quot; in the customary binary sense, resulting in a display of &quot;1.4&amp;nbsp;MB&quot; (1.40625&amp;nbsp;MB). Some users have noticed the missing 0.04&amp;nbsp;MB and both Apple and Microsoft have support bulletins referring to them as 1.4 MB.&lt;ref
 name=&quot;Microsoft 121839&quot;&gt;{{Cite web
 | last =Microsoft
 | title = Determining Actual Disk Size: Why 1.44 MB Should Be 1.40 MB

}} &quot;The 1.44-megabyte (MB) value associated with the 3.5-inch disk format does not represent the actual size or free space of these disks. Although its size has been popularly called 1.44 MB, the correct size is actually 1.40 MB.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

The earlier 1200&amp;nbsp;KB (1200×1024) 5¼ inch diskette sold with the [[PC AT|IBM PC AT]] was marketed as 1.2&amp;nbsp;MB (1.171875&amp;nbsp;MiB).  The largest 8&amp;nbsp;inch diskette formats could contain more than a megabyte, and the capacities of those devices were often irregularly specified in megabytes, also without controversy.

Older and smaller diskette formats were usually identified as an accurate number of (binary) KB, for example the [[Disk II|Apple Disk II]] described as 140KB had a 140×1024 byte capacity, and the original &quot;360KB&quot; double sided, double density disk drive used on the IBM PC had a 360×1024 byte capacity.

In many cases diskette hardware was marketed based on unformatted capacity, and the overhead required to format sectors on the media would reduce the nominal capacity as well (and this overhead typically varied based on the size of the formatted sectors), leading to more irregularities.

====Optical discs====
The capacities of most [[optical disc]] storage media like [[DVD]], [[Blu-ray Disc]], [[HD DVD]] and [[Magneto-optical drive|magneto-optical (MO)]]  are given using SI decimal prefixes.
A &quot;4.7 GB&quot; DVD has a nominal capacity of about 4.38 [[GiB]].&lt;ref name=&quot;dvdcap&quot;&gt;[http://www.osta.org/technology/pdf/dvdqa.pdf#page=20 Understanding Recordable and Rewritable DVD]&lt;/ref&gt;  However, [[compact disc|CD]] capacities are always given using customary binary prefixes. Thus a &quot;700 MB&quot; (or &quot;80 minute&quot;) CD has a nominal capacity of about 700 [[MiB]] (approx 730 MB).&lt;ref name=&quot;cdromcap&quot;&gt;[http://www.videohelp.com/forum/userguides/135642.php Data capacity of CDs]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tape drives and media====
Tape drive and media manufacturers use SI decimal prefixes to identify capacity.&lt;ref&gt;see e.g., [ftp://ftp.software.ibm.com/common/ssi/pm/sp/n/tsd00063usen/TSD00063USEN.PDFIBM 3592 Tape Cartridge], [http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/Ecma-319.pdf ECMA-319, Ultrium-1] etc.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Data transmission and clock rates====
Certain units are always used with SI decimal prefixes even in computing contexts.
Two examples are [[hertz]] (Hz), which is used to measure the [[clock rate]]s of electronic components, and bit/s, used to measure [[bit rate|data transmission speed]].
* A 1&amp;nbsp;GHz processor receives {{gaps|1|000|000|000}} clock ticks per second
* A sound file sampled at 44.1&amp;nbsp;kHz has {{gaps|44|100}} samples per second
* A 128 kbit/s [[MP3]] stream consumes {{gaps|128|000|bits}} (16 kilobytes, 15.6&amp;nbsp;KiB) per second
* A 1&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s Internet connection can transfer {{gaps|1|000|000|bits}} per second ({{gaps|125|000}} bytes per second ≈ 122&amp;nbsp;KiB/s, assuming an 8-bit byte and no overhead)
* A 1&amp;nbsp;Gbit/s Ethernet connection can transfer {{gaps|1|000|000|000|bits}} per second ({{gaps|125|000|000}} bytes per second ≈ 119&amp;nbsp;MiB/s, assuming an 8-bit byte and no overhead)
* A [[56K]] modem transfers {{gaps|56|000}} bits per second ≈ 6.8&amp;nbsp;KiB/s.

[[Computer bus|Bus]] clock speeds and therefore bandwidths are both quoted using SI decimal prefixes.

* [[DDR SDRAM|PC3200]] memory on a [[double data rate]] bus, transferring 8 bytes per cycle with a clock speed of 200&amp;nbsp;MHz ({{gaps|200|000|000|cycles}} per second) has a bandwidth of {{gaps|200|000|000|×|8|×|2}} = {{gaps|3|200|000|000|bytes/second}} = 3.2 GB/s (about 3.0&amp;nbsp;GiB/s).
* A [[PCI-X]] bus at 66&amp;nbsp;MHz ({{gaps|66|000|000|cycles}} per second), 64 bits per transfer, has a bandwidth of {{gaps|66|000|000|transfers/second|×|64|bits/transfer}} = {{gaps|4|224|000|000|bits/second}}, or {{gaps|528|000|000|bytes/second}}, usually quoted as 528 MB/s (about 503&amp;nbsp;MiB/s).

The '''National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum''' is an American history [[museum]] and [[hall of fame]], located at 25 Main Street in [[Cooperstown, New York]], operated by private interests serving as the central point for the study of the [[history of baseball in the United States]] and beyond, the display of baseball-related artifacts and exhibits, and the honoring of persons who have excelled in [[baseball positions|playing]], [[manager (baseball)|managing]], and serving the sport. The Hall's motto is &quot;Preserving History, Honoring Excellence, Connecting Generations&quot;.

The word '''Cooperstown''' is often used as shorthand (or a [[Metonymy|metonym]]) for the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum.

==History==
{{Expand section|date=April 2009}}
[[Image:Baseball Hof.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The entrance to the Baseball Hall of Fame.]]
The Hall of Fame was dedicated on June 12, 1939. [[Stephen Carlton Clark]] was owner of a local hotel and sought to bring tourists to Cooperstown, which had been suffering economically when the [[Great Depression]] significantly reduced the local tourist trade and [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] devastated the local [[hops]] industry. His granddaughter, Jane Forbes Clark, is the current Chairman of the Board of Directors. The erroneous claim that [[American Civil War|U.S. Civil War]] hero [[Abner Doubleday]] [[Origins of baseball|invented baseball]] in Cooperstown, a claim made by former [[National League]] president [[Abraham G. Mills]] and his 1905 Mills Commission, was instrumental in the early marketing of the Hall.

An $8 million library and research facility opened in 1994. [[Dale Petroskey]] became the organization's president in 1999.

In 2002, ''Baseball As America'' was launched, a traveling exhibit that toured ten American museums over six years. The Hall of Fame has also sponsored educational programming on the Internet to bring the Hall of Fame to schoolchildren who might not visit. The Hall and Museum completed a series of renovations in spring 2005. The Hall of Fame also presents an annual exhibit at FanFest at the [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game]].

[[Jeff Idelson]] replaced Petroskey as president on April 16, 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;USAToday-IdelsonPresident&quot;&gt;{{cite news

He had been acting as president since March 25, 2008, when his predecessor was forced to resign for &quot;fail[ing] to exercise proper [[fiduciary]] responsibility&quot; while making &quot;judgments that were not in the best interest of the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080325&amp;content_id=2458145&amp;vkey=news_mlb&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=mlb The Official Site of Major League Baseball: News: HOF president Petroskey resigns] from the [[Major League Baseball]] website&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inductees==
Among baseball fans, &quot;Hall of Fame&quot; means not only the museum and facility in Cooperstown, New York, but the pantheon of players, [[manager (baseball)|managers]], [[umpire (baseball)|umpires]], executives, and pioneers who have been enshrined in the Hall. The first five men elected were [[Ty Cobb]], [[Babe Ruth]], [[Honus Wagner]], [[Christy Mathewson]] and [[Walter Johnson]], named in 1936. {{As of|2011|1}}, 295 individuals had been elected to the Hall of Fame, including 205 former Major League players, 35 [[Negro league baseball|Negro Leaguers]], 19 managers, 9 umpires, and 27 pioneers, executives, and organizers. The newest members are [[Andre Dawson]], umpire [[Doug Harvey (umpire)|Doug Harvey]] and manager [[Whitey Herzog]]; the induction class of 2011, which will enter the Hall in July of that year, will consist of players [[Roberto Alomar]] and [[Bert Blyleven]] plus executive [[Pat Gillick]]. In addition to honoring Hall of Fame inductees, the National Baseball Hall of Fame has presented 34&lt;!--as of 2010 induction class--&gt; men with the [[Ford C. Frick Award]] for excellence in broadcasting,&lt;ref name=&quot;FrickAward&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://baseballhall.org/museum/awards/ford-c-frick |title=Hall of Fame Awards: Ford C.

===Selection process===
[[Image:Plaque first.jpg|thumb|left|upright|250px|Plaques of the First Class of Inductees]]
Players are currently inducted into the Hall of Fame through election by either the [[Baseball Writers Association of America]] (or BBWAA), or the [[Veterans Committee]],&lt;ref&gt;Following the most recent changes to the voting procedure in 2010, the official name is &quot;Committee to Consider Managers, Umpires, Executives and Long-Retired Players&quot;. The term &quot;Veterans Committee&quot; comes from the former official name of &quot;Committee on Baseball Veterans&quot;. Although the Hall no longer uses the term, it remains universally used by baseball media.&lt;/ref&gt; which now consists of three subcommittees, each of which considers and votes for candidates from a separate era of baseball. Five years after retirement, any player with 10 years of major league experience who passes a screening committee (which removes from consideration players of clearly lesser qualification) is eligible to be elected by BBWAA members with 10 years' membership or more. From a final ballot typically including 25–40 candidates, each writer may vote for up to 10 players; until the late 1950s, voters were advised to cast votes for the maximum 10 candidates. Any player named on 75% or more of all ballots cast is elected. A player who is named on fewer than 5% of ballots is dropped from future elections. In some instances, the screening committee had restored their names to later ballots, but in the mid-1990s, dropped players were made permanently ineligible for Hall of Fame consideration, even by the Veterans Committee. A 2001 change in the election procedures restored the eligibility of these dropped players; while their names will not appear on future BBWAA ballots, they may be considered by the Veterans Committee.

Under special circumstances, certain players may be deemed eligible for induction even though they have not met all requirements. [[Addie Joss]] was elected in 1978, despite only playing nine seasons before he died of meningitis. Additionally, if an otherwise eligible player dies before his fifth year of retirement, then that player may be placed on the ballot at the first election at least six months after his death. [[Roberto Clemente]]'s induction in 1973 set the precedent when the writers chose to put him up for consideration after his death on New Year's Eve, 1972.

In 1936 all players were eligible, including active ones. From the 1937 election until the 1945 election, there was no waiting period, so any retired player was eligible, but writers were discouraged from voting for current major leaguers. Since there was no formal rule preventing a writer from casting a ballot for an active player, the scribes did not always comply with the informal guideline; [[Joe DiMaggio]] received a vote in 1945, for example. From the 1946 election until the 1954 election, an official one-year waiting period was in effect. (DiMaggio, for example, retired after the 1951 season and was first eligible in the 1953 election.) The modern rule establishing a wait of five years was passed in 1954, although an exception was made for Joe DiMaggio because of his high level of previous support, thus permitting him to be elected within four years of his retirement. Contrary to popular belief, no formal exception was made for [[Lou Gehrig]], other than to hold a special one-man election for him. There was no waiting period at that time and Gehrig met all other qualifications, so he would have been eligible for the next regular election after he retired during the 1939 season, but the BBWAA decided to hold a special election at the 1939 Winter Meetings in Cincinnati, specifically to elect Gehrig (most likely because it was known that he was [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis|terminally ill]], making it uncertain that he would live long enough to see another election). Nobody else was on that ballot, and the numerical results have never been made public. Since no elections were held in 1940 or 1941, the special election permitted Gehrig to enter the Hall while still alive.

If a player fails to be elected by the BBWAA within 20 years of his retirement from active play, he may be selected by the Veterans Committee. Following the most recent changes to the election process for that body made in 2010, it is now responsible for electing all otherwise eligible candidates who are not eligible for the BBWAA ballot—both long-retired players and non-playing personnel (managers, umpires, and executives). With these changes, each candidate can now be considered once every three years.&lt;ref name=&quot;2010 changes&quot;&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://baseballhall.org/news/voting-news/hall-fame-board-directors-restructures-procedures-consideration-managers-umpires  |title=Hall of Fame Board of Directors Restructures Procedures for Consideration of Managers, Umpires, Executives and Long-Retired Players |publisher=National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum |date=2010-07-26 |accessdate=2010-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; A more complete discussion of the new process is available [[#Changes to Veterans Committee process|below]].

From 2008 to 2010, following changes made by the Hall in July 2007, the main Veterans Committee, then made up of living Hall of Famers, voted only on players whose careers began in 1943 or later. These changes also established three separate committees to select other figures:
* One committee voted on managers and umpires for induction in every even-numbered year. This committee voted only twice— [[Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 2008|in 2007 for induction in 2008]] and [[Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 2010|in 2009 for induction in 2010]].
* One committee voted on executives and builders for induction in every even-numbered year. This committee conducted its only two votes in the same years as the managers/umpires committee.
* The pre–World War II players committee was intended to vote every five years on players whose careers began in 1942 or earlier. It conducted its only vote as part of the election process [[Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 2009|for induction in 2009]].&lt;ref name=&quot;HoF-VC-1942&quot;&gt;{{cite web

  | accessdate = 2009-12-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Players of the [[Negro League baseball|Negro Leagues]] have also been considered at various times, beginning in 1971. In 2005 the Hall completed a study on African American players between the late 19th century and the integration of the major leagues in 1947, and conducted a special election for such players in February 2006; seventeen figures from the Negro Leagues were chosen in that election, in addition to the eighteen previously selected. Following the 2010 changes, Negro Leagues figures will primarily be considered for induction alongside other figures from the 1871–1946 era, called the &quot;Pre-Integration Era&quot; by the Hall.

Predictably, the selection process catalyzes endless debate among baseball fans over the merits of various candidates. Even players already elected remain for years the subjects of discussions as to whether their elections were deserved or in error. For example, [[Bill James]]' book ''[[Whatever Happened to the Hall of Fame?]]'' goes into detail about who he believes does and does not belong in the Hall of Fame.

===Changes to Veterans Committee process===
{{Main|Veterans Committee}}
The actions and composition of the Veterans Committee have been at times controversial, with occasional selections of contemporaries and teammates of the committee members over seemingly more worthy candidates.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT-2001ChassReform&quot;&gt;{{Cite news

In 2001, the Veterans Committee was reformed to comprise the living Hall of Fame members and other honorees.&lt;ref name=&quot;hof-changes&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.baseballhalloffame.org/hofers_and_honorees/veterans/veterans_changes.htm |title = Changes to Veterans Committee Procedures |accessdate = 2007-01-06 |work = baseballhalloffame.org |publisher = National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060929063713/http://www.baseballhalloffame.org/hofers_and_honorees/veterans/veterans_changes.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The revamped Committee held three elections—in [[Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 2003|2003]] and [[Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 2007|2007]] for both players and non-players, and in [[Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 2005|2005]] for players only. No individual was elected in that time, sparking criticism among some observers who expressed doubt whether the new Veterans Committee would ever elect a player. The Committee members – most of whom were Hall members – were accused of being reluctant to elect new candidates in the hope of heightening the value of their own selection. After no one was selected for the third consecutive election in 2007, Hall of Famer [[Mike Schmidt]] noted, &quot;The same thing happens every year. The current members want to preserve the prestige as much as possible, and are unwilling to open the doors.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Walker&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/news?slug=ap-halloffame&amp;prov=ap&amp;type=lgns |title=Vets committee throws another shutout at Hall of Fame |accessdate=2007-02-28 |last=Walker |first=Ben |date=2007-02-28 |work=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, the committee and its selection processes were again reorganized; the main committee then included all living members of the Hall, and voted on a reduced number of candidates from among players whose careers began in 1943 or later. Separate committees, including sportswriters and broadcasters, would select umpires, managers and executives, as well as players from earlier eras.

In the first election to be held under the 2007 revisions, two managers and three executives were elected in December 2007 as part of the [[Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 2008|2008 election process]]. The next Veterans Committee elections for players were held in December 2008 as part of the [[Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 2009|2009 election process]]; the main committee did not select a player, while the panel for pre–World War II players elected [[Joe Gordon]] in its first and ultimately only vote. The main committee voted as part of the election process for inductions in odd-numbered years, while the pre-WWII panel would vote every five years, and the panel for umpires, managers, and executives voted as part of the election process for inductions in even-numbered years.

Further changes to the Veterans Committee process were announced by the Hall on July 26, 2010, effective with the [[Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 2011|2011 election]].&lt;ref name=&quot;2010 changes&quot;/&gt;

All individuals eligible for induction but not eligible for BBWAA consideration will now be considered on a single ballot, grouped by the following eras in which they made their greatest contributions:
* Pre-Integration Era (1871–1946)
* Golden Era (1947–1972)
* Expansion Era (1973 and later)
The Hall will use the BBWAA's Historical Overview Committee to formulate the ballots for each era, consisting of 12 individuals for the Expansion Era and 10 for the other eras. The Hall's board of directors will select a committee of 16 voters for each era, made up of Hall of Famers, executives, baseball historians, and media members. Each committee will meet and vote at the Baseball Winter Meetings once every three years. The Expansion Era committee held its first vote in 2010 for 2011 induction, with longtime [[general manager (baseball)|general manager]] [[Pat Gillick]] becoming the first individual elected under the new procedure. The Golden Era committee will vote in 2011 for the induction class of 2012, and the Pre-Integration Era committee will vote in 2012 for induction in 2013. Subsequent elections will rotate among the three committees in that order.

===Players with multiple teams===
While the text on a player's plaque lists all of teams for which the player was a member, inductees are depicted wearing the cap of a specific team, or, in some cases, wearing a cap without a logo. The Hall selects the logo &quot;based on where that player makes his most indelible mark.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;FAQ-logoSelection&quot;&gt;{{cite web

Although the Hall always made the final decision on which logo was shown, until 2001 the Hall deferred to the wishes of players whose careers were linked with multiple teams. Some examples of honorees associated with multiple teams are the following:
*'''[[Frank Robinson]]''': Robinson chose to have the [[Baltimore Orioles]] cap displayed on his plaque, although he had played ten seasons with the [[Cincinnati Reds]] and six seasons with Baltimore. Robinson won four pennants and two World Series with the Orioles and one pennant with Cincinnati. His second World Series ring came in the [[1970 World Series]] against the Reds. His numbers with the Orioles and the Reds were very good and he won an [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award|MVP]] award while playing for each team.
*'''[[Catfish Hunter]]''': When elected to the Hall of Fame in 1987, Hunter declined to choose between the teams for which he played — the [[Oakland Athletics]] and [[New York Yankees]] — as he had been successful with both teams and maintained good relations with both teams and their respective owners ([[Charlie Finley|Charles Finley]] and [[George Steinbrenner]]). His plaque shows him wearing a cap without a logo.
*'''[[Nolan Ryan]]''': Born and raised in Texas, Ryan entered the Hall in 1999 wearing a [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] cap on his plaque, although he spent only five seasons with the Rangers, while having longer and more successful tenures with the [[Houston Astros]] (nine seasons, 1980–88 and his record-setting fifth career no-hitter) and [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim|California Angels]] (eight seasons, 1972–79 and the first four of his seven career no-hitters). Ryan's only championship was as a member of the [[New York Mets]] in [[1969 World Series|1969]]. Ryan finished his career with the Rangers, reaching his 5000th strikeout and 300th win, and throwing the last two of his no-hitters
*'''[[Reggie Jackson]]''': Jackson chose a [[New York Yankees]] cap over an [[Oakland Athletics]] cap. As a member of the Kansas City/Oakland A's, Jackson played ten seasons (1967–75, '87), winning three World Series ([[1972 World Series|1972]], [[1973 World Series|1973]], [[1974 World Series|1974]]) and the 1973 [[AL MVP|AL MVP Award]]. During his five years in New York (1977–81), Jackson won two World Series ([[1977 World Series|1977]]–[[1978 World Series|78]]), with his crowning achievement occurring during [[1977 World Series#Game 6|Game 6 of the 1977 World Series]], when he hit three home runs on consecutive pitches and earned his nickname &quot;Mr. October&quot;.
*'''[[Carlton Fisk]]''': Fisk went into the hall with a [[Boston Red Sox]] cap on his plaque in 2000 despite playing with the [[Chicago White Sox]] longer and posting more significant numbers with the White Sox. Fisk's choice of the Red Sox was likely because of his being a [[New England]] native, as well as his famous walk-off home run in [[1975 World Series#Game 6|Game Six of the 1975 World Series]] with which he is most associated.
*'''[[Dave Winfield]]''': Winfield had spent the most years in his career with the Yankees and had had great success there, but chose to go into the Hall as a [[San Diego Padres|Padre]] due to his feud with Yankees owner [[George Steinbrenner]].

In 2001, the Hall of Fame decided to change the policy on cap logo selection, as a result of rumors that some teams were offering compensation, such as number retirement, money, or organizational jobs, in exchange for the cap designation. (For example, though [[Wade Boggs]] denied the claims, some media reports had said that his contract with the [[Tampa Bay Rays|Tampa Bay Devil Rays]] required him to request depiction in the Hall of Fame as a Devil Ray.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The Hall decided that it would no longer defer to the inductee, though the player's wishes would be considered, when deciding on the logo to appear on the plaque. Newly elected members affected by the change include the following:
*'''[[Gary Carter]]''': Inducted in 2003, Carter was the first player to be affected by the new policy. Carter won his only championship with the [[1986 World Series|1986]] [[New York Mets]], and wanted his induction plaque to depict him wearing a Mets cap, even though he had spent twelve years (1974–84, 1992) with the [[Montreal Expos]] and only five (1985–89) with the Mets. The Hall of Fame decided that his plaque would instead show Carter with an Expos cap.
*'''[[Wade Boggs]]''': Boggs's only championship was as a member of the [[1996 World Series|1996]] [[New York Yankees]], for whom he played from 1993–97, but his best career numbers were posted during his eleven years (1982–92) wearing the [[Boston Red Sox]] uniform. Boggs would eventually be depicted wearing a Boston cap for his 2005 induction, despite his acrimonious relationship with Red Sox management.
*'''[[Andre Dawson]]''': Dawson's cap depicts him as a member of the [[Montreal Expos]], his team for eleven years, despite his expressed preference to be shown as a member of the [[Chicago Cubs]]. While Dawson played only six years with the Cubs, five of his eight All-Star appearances were with the Cubs, and his only MVP award came in his first year with the Cubs in 1987.&lt;ref name=&quot;ChicagoTribune-LogoAnnouncement&quot;&gt;{{Cite web

==The museum==
According to the Hall of Fame, approximately 350,000 visitors enter the museum each year,&lt;ref name=&quot;visitors&quot;/&gt; and the running total has surpassed 14 million. These visitors see only a fraction of its 35,000 artifacts, 2.6 million library items (such as newspaper clippings and photos) and 130,000 baseball cards.

*'''Scribes and Mikemen''' honors [[J. G. Taylor Spink Award]] and [[Ford C. Frick Award]] winners with a photo display and has artifacts related to baseball writing and broadcasting.  Floor-to-ceiling windows at the Scribes and Mikemen exhibit face an outdoor courtyard with statues of [[Johnny Podres]] and [[Roy Campanella]] (representing the [[Los Angeles Dodgers|Brooklyn Dodgers]] 1955 championship team), and an unnamed [[All-American Girls Professional Baseball League]] player. A [[Satchel Paige]] statue was unveiled and dedicated during 2006 Induction Weekend.

===Second floor===
*The '''Grandstand Theater''' features a 12 minute multimedia film. The 200 seat theater, complete with replica stadium seats, is decorated to resemble old [[Comiskey Park]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.baseballhalloffame.org/news/article.jsp?ymd=20070221&amp;content_id=1047&amp;vkey=hof_news National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum: Hall of Fame News]&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''The Game''' is the major feature of the second floor. It is where the most artifacts are displayed. The Game is set up in a timeline format, starting with baseball's beginnings and culminating with the game we know today. There are several offshoots of this meandering timeline:
**The '''[[Babe Ruth]] Room'''
**'''Diamond Dreams''' (women in baseball)
**'''Viva Baseball!''' (celebrates baseball in the Caribbean Basin)
**'''Pride and Passion''' ([[Negro Leagues]] exhibit)
**'''Taking The Field''' (19th century baseball)
*The '''Today's Game''' exhibit is built like a baseball clubhouse, with 30 glass-enclosed locker stalls, one for each Major League franchise. In each stall there is a jersey and other items from the designated big league team, along with a brief team history. A center display case holds objects donated to the Hall of Fame from the past year or two. Fans can also look into a room designed to look like a manager's office. Outside is a display case with rotating artifacts. Currently the space is devoted to the [[World Baseball Classic]].

===Third floor===
[[Image:Ichiro display.JPG|thumb|upright|The display of [[Ichiro Suzuki]]]]
*'''Autumn Glory''' is devoted to post-season baseball and has, among other artifacts, replicas of [[World Series]] rings.
*'''Hank Aaron: Chasing the Dream'''
*An '''Education Gallery''' hosts school groups and, in the summer, presentations about artifacts from the museum's collection. In the gallery foyer is a TV that continually plays baseball bloopers and the popular [[Abbott and Costello]] routine &quot;[[Who's on First?]]&quot; and a display case with rotating exhibits.
*The '''Records Room''' has charts showing active and all-time leaders in various baseball statistical categories. The statistics charts are posted on the walls, leaving the center space for other purposes:
**'''[[BBWAA]] awards''': Replicas of various awards distributed by the BBWAA at the end of each season, along with a list of past winners.
**A case dedicated to '''[[Ichiro Suzuki]]''' setting the major league record for base hits in a single season, with 262 in 2004.
**A case full of World Series Rings from prior years from the 1900s to present.
**An '''inductee database''' touch-screen computer with statistics for every inductee.
**'''Programs''' from every [[World Series]].
*'''Sacred Ground''' is the newest museum section, opened after the 2003–05 renovation. It is devoted entirely to ballparks and everything about them, especially the fan experience and the business of a ballpark. The centerpiece is a computer tour of three former ballparks: [[Atlanta Braves|Boston's]] [[South End Grounds]], [[Chicago White Sox|Chicago's]] [[Comiskey Park]], and [[Los Angeles Dodgers|Brooklyn's]] [[Ebbets Field]].

==Unauthorized sale of items in collection==
A controversy erupted in 1982, when it emerged that some historic items given to the Hall had been sold on the collectibles market. The items had been lent to the [[Baseball Commissioner]]'s office, gotten mixed up with other property owned by the Commissioner's office and employees of the office, and moved to the garage of Joe Reichler, an assistant to Commissioner [[Bowie Kuhn]], who sold the items to resolve his personal financial difficulties. Under pressure from the New York Attorney General, the Commissioner's Office made reparations, but the negative publicity damaged the Hall of Fame's reputation, and made it more difficult for it to solicit donations.&lt;ref name=&quot;James-HoFItemSale&quot;&gt;{{Cite book

==Non-induction of banned players==
Following the banning of [[Pete Rose]] from baseball, the selection rules for the Baseball Hall of Fame were modified to prevent the induction of anyone on MLB's permanent suspension list, such as Rose or [[Shoeless Joe Jackson]]. Many others have been barred from participation in MLB, but none have Hall of Fame qualifications on the level of Jackson or Rose. A select few, such as [[Hal Chase]] and [[Eddie Cicotte]], would be reasonable candidates had they not been banned.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

Jackson and Rose were both banned from baseball for life for actions related to gambling on their own teams—Jackson was determined to have cooperated with those who conspired to lose the [[1919 World Series]] intentionally, and Rose voluntarily accepted a permanent spot on the ineligible list in return for MLB's promise to make no official finding in relation to alleged betting on the [[Cincinnati Reds]] when he was their manager in the 1980s. (Baseball's Rule 21, prominently posted in every clubhouse locker room, mandates permanent banishment from the sport for having a gambling interest of any sort on a game in which a player or manager is directly involved.) Rose later admitted that he bet on the Reds in his [[My Prison Without Bars|2004 autobiography]]. Baseball fans are deeply split on the issue of whether these two should remain banned or have their punishment revoked. Writer [[Bill James]], though he advocates Rose eventually making it into the Hall of Fame, compared the people who want to put Jackson in the Hall of Fame to &quot;those women who show up at murder trials wanting to marry the cute murderer&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;James (1995:358)&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Bull Durham'' censorship controversy==
In April 2003, one month after the start of the [[Iraq War]], Hall of Fame President Dale Petroskey caused a furor when he canceled an event meant to commemorate the 15th anniversary of the well-known 1988 baseball movie ''[[Bull Durham]]'' because of the anti-war stance of two of its stars, [[Tim Robbins]] and [[Susan Sarandon]], fearing that they would use the event as a platform for their political views.&lt;ref&gt;The Associated Press, April 19, 2003, &quot;Hall president apologizes for not calling actors before canceling event&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Petroskey, a former assistant press secretary in the [[Reagan administration]], sent Robbins and Sarandon a letter that said: &quot;We believe your very public criticism of President Bush at this important – and sensitive – time in our nation's history helps undermine the U.S. position, which ultimately could put our troops in even more danger.&quot; Robbins responded: &quot;Long live democracy, free speech and the [[1969 World Series|'69 Mets]] – all improbable, glorious miracles that I have always believed in.&quot;

Many people, including well-known baseball figures like authors [[Roger Kahn]] and [[Jules Tygiel]], were upset by what they saw as an attempt to punish political speech. Kahn canceled an appearance at the Hall and Tygiel called for Petroskey's resignation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Walker |first=Ben |title=Hall president reiterates stance; author Kahn cancels Cooperstown trip |url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/hallfame/2003-04-11-bull-durham-folo_x.htm |publisher=''USA Today'' |date=Apr 11, 2003 |accessdate=Mar 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Enders |first=Eric |title=Petroskey Shames Hall |url=http://www.efqreview.com/NewFiles/v20n3/noisefromthedugout.html |publisher=''Elysian Fields Quarterly'' |volume=20 |issue=3 |date=Summer 2003 |accessdate=2011-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Bull Durham'' co-star [[Kevin Costner]] defended Robbins and Sarandon, saying, &quot;I think Tim and Susan's courage is the type of courage that makes our democracy work... Pulling back this invite is against the whole principle about what we fight for and profess to be about.”&lt;ref&gt;Entertainment Weekly's EW.com, April 11, 2003, &quot;Crying Foul,&quot; http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,443033,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Informally, a problem is in '''BPP''' if there is an algorithm for it that has the following properties:
*It is allowed to flip coins and make random decisions
*It is guaranteed to run in polynomial time
*On any given run of the algorithm, it has a probability of at most 1/3 of giving the wrong answer, whether the answer is YES or NO.

==Introduction==

'''BPP''' is one of the largest ''practical'' classes of problems, meaning most problems of interest in '''BPP''' have efficient [[probabilistic algorithm]]s that can be run quickly on real modern machines. For this reason it is of great practical interest which problems and classes of problems are inside '''BPP'''. '''BPP''' also contains '''P''', the class of problems solvable in polynomial time with a deterministic machine, since a deterministic machine is a special case of a probabilistic machine.

In practice, an error probability of 1/3 might not be acceptable, however, the choice of 1/3 in the definition is arbitrary. It can be any [[mathematical constant|constant]] between 0 and 1/2 (exclusive) and the set '''BPP''' will be unchanged. It does not even have to be constant: the same class of problems is defined by allowing error as high as 1/2 − ''n''&lt;sup&gt;−''c''&lt;/sup&gt; on the one hand, or requiring error as small as 2&lt;sup&gt;−''n&lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt;''&lt;/sup&gt; on the other hand, where ''c'' is any positive constant, and ''n'' is the length of input. The idea is that there is a probability of error, but if the algorithm is run many times, the chance that the majority of the runs are wrong [[exponential decay|drops off exponentially]] as a consequence of the [[Chernoff bound]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.sfu.ca/~kabanets/cmpt710/lec16.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; This makes it possible to create a highly accurate algorithm by merely running the algorithm several times and taking a &quot;majority vote&quot; of the answers. For example, if one defined the class with the restriction that the algorithm can be wrong with probability at most 1/2&lt;sup&gt;100&lt;/sup&gt;, this would result in the same class of problems.

== Definition ==
A language ''L'' is in '''BPP''' if and only if there exists a probabilistic Turing machine ''M'', such that
* ''M'' runs for polynomial time on all inputs
* For all ''x'' in ''L'', ''M'' outputs 1 with probability greater than or equal to 2/3
* For all ''x'' not in ''L'', ''M'' outputs 1 with probability less than or equal to 1/3
Unlike the complexity class [[ZPP (complexity)|ZPP]], the machine ''M'' is required to run for polynomial time on all inputs, regardless of the outcome of the random coin flips.

Alternatively, '''BPP''' can be defined using only deterministic Turing machines. A language ''L'' is in '''BPP''' if and only if there exists a polynomial ''p'' and deterministic Turing machine ''M'', such that
* ''M'' runs for polynomial time on all inputs
* For all ''x'' in ''L'', the fraction of strings ''y'' of length ''p''(|''x''|) which satisfy ''M(x,y)'' = 1 is greater than or equal to 2/3
* For all ''x'' in not in ''L'', the fraction of strings ''y'' of length ''p''(|''x''|) which satisfy ''M(x,y)'' = 1 is less than or equal to 1/3
In this definition, the string ''y'' corresponds to the output of the random coin flips that the probabilistic Turing machine would have made. For some applications this definition is preferable since it does not mention probabilistic Turing machines.

== Problems ==
Besides the problems in '''P''', which are obviously in '''BPP''', many problems were known to be in '''BPP''' but not known to be in '''P'''. The number of such problems is decreasing, and it is conjectured that '''P''' = '''BPP'''.

For a long time, one of the most famous problems that was known to be in '''BPP''' but not known to be in '''P''' was the problem of [[primality test|determining]] whether a given number is [[prime number|prime]]. However, in the 2002 paper '' [[AKS primality test|PRIMES is in P]]'', [[Manindra Agrawal]] and his students [[Neeraj Kayal]] and [[Nitin Saxena]] found a deterministic polynomial-time algorithm for this problem, thus showing that it is in '''P'''.

An important example of a problem in '''BPP''' (in fact in [[RP (complexity)|co-RP]]) still not known to be in '''P''' is [[polynomial identity testing]], the problem of determining whether a polynomial is identically equal to the zero polynomial. In other words, is there an assignment of variables such that when the polynomial is evaluated the result is nonzero? It suffices to choose each variable's value uniformly at random from a finite subset of at least ''d'' values to achieve bounded error probability, where ''d'' is the total degree of the polynomial.&lt;ref&gt;Madhu Sudan and Shien Jin Ong. Massachusetts Institute of Technology: 6.841/18.405J Advanced Complexity Theory: [http://people.csail.mit.edu/madhu/ST03/scribe/lect06.pdf Lecture 6: Randomized Algorithms, Properties of BPP]. February 26, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Related classes ==

If the access to randomness is removed from the definition of '''BPP''', we get the complexity class '''P'''. In the definition of the class, if we replace the ordinary [[Turing machine]] with a [[quantum computer]], we get the class '''[[BQP]]'''.

A [[Monte Carlo algorithm]] is a [[randomized algorithm]] which is likely to be correct. Problems in the class '''BPP''' have Monte Carlo algorithms with polynomial bounded running time. This is compared to a [[Las Vegas algorithm]] which is a randomized algorithm which either outputs the correct answer, or outputs &quot;fail&quot; with low probability. Las Vegas algorithms with polynomial bound running times are used to define the class '''[[ZPP (complexity)|ZPP]]'''. Alternatively, '''ZPP''' contains probabilistic algorithms that are always correct and have expected polynomial running time. This is weaker than saying it is a polynomial time algorithm, since it may run for super-polynomial time, but with very low probability.

== Complexity-theoretic properties ==

It is known that '''BPP''' is closed under [[Complement (complexity)|complement]]; that is, '''BPP''' = '''co-BPP'''. '''BPP''' is [[low (complexity)|low]] for itself, meaning that a '''BPP''' machine with the power to solve '''BPP''' problems instantly (a '''BPP''' [[oracle machine]]) is not any more powerful than the machine without this extra power. In symbols, '''BPP'''&lt;sup&gt;'''BPP'''&lt;/sup&gt; = '''BPP'''.

The relationship between '''BPP''' and '''[[NP (complexity)|NP]]''' is unknown: it is not known if '''BPP''' is a [[subset]] of '''[[NP (complexity)|NP]]''', '''NP''' is a subset of '''BPP''' or if they are incomparable. If '''NP''' is contained in '''BPP''', which is considered unlikely since it would imply practical solutions for [[NP-complete]] problems, then '''NP''' = '''RP''' and '''[[PH (complexity)|PH]]''' ⊆ '''BPP'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://weblog.fortnow.com/2005/12/pulling-out-quantumness.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is known that '''[[RP (complexity)|RP]]''' is a subset of '''BPP''', and '''BPP''' is a subset of '''[[PP (complexity)|PP]]'''.  It is not known whether those two are strict subsets, since we don't even know if '''P''' is a strict subset of '''PSPACE'''. '''BPP''' is contained in the second level of the [[polynomial hierarchy]] and therefore it is contained in '''PH'''. More precisely, the [[Sipser–Lautemann theorem]] states that '''BPP''' ⊆ Σ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ∩ Π&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. As a result, '''P''' = '''NP''' leads to '''P''' = '''BPP''' since '''PH''' collapses to '''P''' in this case. Thus either '''P''' = '''BPP''' or '''P''' ≠ '''NP''' or both.

[[Adleman's theorem]] states that membership in any language in '''BPP''' can be determined by a family of polynomial-size [[Boolean circuit]]s, which means '''BPP''' is contained in '''[[P/poly]]'''.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, as a consequence of the proof of this fact, every BPP algorithm operating on inputs of bounded length can be derandomized into a deterministic algorithm using a fixed string of random bits. Finding this string may be expensive, however.

Relative to oracles, we know that there exist oracles A and B, such that '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt; = '''BPP'''&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt; and '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;B&lt;/sup&gt; ≠ '''BPP'''&lt;sup&gt;B&lt;/sup&gt;. Moreover, relative to a [[random oracle]] with probability 1,  '''P''' = '''BPP''' and '''BPP''' is strictly contained in '''NP''' and '''co-NP'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1=Bennett | first1=Charles H. | author1-link=Charles H.

== Derandomization ==

The existence of certain strong [[pseudorandom number generators]] is [[conjecture]]d by most experts of the field. This conjecture implies that randomness does not give additional computational power to polynomial time computation, that is, '''P''' = '''RP''' = '''BPP'''. Note that ordinary generators are not sufficient to show this result; any probabilistic algorithm implemented using a typical random number generator will always produce incorrect results on certain inputs irrespective of the seed (though these inputs might be rare).

[[László Babai]], [[Lance Fortnow]], [[Noam Nisan]], and [[Avi Wigderson]] showed that unless '''[[EXPTIME]]''' collapses to '''[[MA (complexity)|MA]]''', '''BPP''' is contained in '''i.o.-SUBEXP''' = &lt;math&gt;\bigcap_{\varepsilon&gt;0}\hbox{i.o.-DTIME}(2^{n^\varepsilon})&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Babai&quot;&gt;László Babai, Lance Fortnow, Noam Nisan, and Avi Wigderson (1993). &quot;BPP has subexponential time simulations unless EXPTIME has publishable proofs&quot;. ''Computational Complexity'', 3:307–318.&lt;/ref&gt; The class '''i.o.-SUBEXP''', which stands for infinitely often SUBEXP, contains problems which have [[sub-exponential time]] algorithms for infinitely many input sizes. They also showed that '''P''' = '''BPP''' if the exponential-time hierarchy, which is defined in terms of the [[polynomial hierarchy]] and '''E''' as '''E&lt;sup&gt;PH&lt;/sup&gt;''', collapses to '''E'''; however, note that the exponential-time hierarchy is usually conjectured ''not'' to collapse.

[[Russell Impagliazzo]] and Avi Wigderson showed that if any problem in '''[[E (complexity)|E]]''', where &lt;math&gt;\textrm{E}=\textrm{DTIME} \left( 2^{O(n)} \right)&lt;/math&gt;, has circuit complexity &lt;math&gt;2^{\Omega(n)}&lt;/math&gt; then '''P''' = '''BPP'''.&lt;ref&gt;Russell Impagliazzo and Avi Wigderson (1997). &quot;P=BPP if E requires exponential circuits: Derandomizing the XOR Lemma&quot;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:BQP complexity class diagram.svg|thumb|The suspected relationship of BQP to other problem spaces&lt;ref&gt;Michael Nielsen and Isaac Chuang (2000). ''Quantum Computation and Quantum Information''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. ISBN 0-521-63503-9.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In [[computational complexity theory]] '''BQP''' (bounded error quantum polynomial time) is the class of [[decision problems]] solvable by a [[quantum computer]] in [[polynomial time]], with an error probability of at most 1/3 for all instances. It is the quantum analogue of the complexity class [[Bounded-error probabilistic polynomial|BPP]].

In other words, there is an [[algorithm]] for a quantum computer (a [[quantum algorithm]]) that solves the decision problem with ''high'' probability and is guaranteed to run in polynomial time. On any given run of the algorithm, it has a probability of at most 1/3 that it will give the wrong answer.

Similarly to other &quot;bounded error&quot; probabilistic classes the choice of 1/3 in the definition is arbitrary. We can run the algorithm a constant number of times and take a majority vote to achieve any desired probability of correctness less than 1, using the [[Chernoff bound]]. Detailed analysis shows that the complexity class is unchanged by allowing error as high as 1/2 − ''n''&lt;sup&gt;−''c''&lt;/sup&gt; on the one hand, or requiring error as small as 2&lt;sup&gt;−''n&lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt;''&lt;/sup&gt; on the other hand, where ''c'' is any positive constant, and ''n'' is the length of input.

==Definition==
'''BQP''' can also be viewed as a bounded-error uniform family of [[quantum circuit]]s. A language ''L'' is in '''BQP''' if and only if there exists a [[Circuit_complexity#Polynomial-time_uniform|polynomial-time uniform]] family of quantum circuits &lt;math&gt;\{Q_n:n \in \mathbb{N}\}&lt;/math&gt;, such that
* For all &lt;math&gt;n \in \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;Q_n&lt;/math&gt; takes ''n'' qubits as input and outputs 1 bit
* For all ''x'' in ''L'', &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Pr}(Q_{|x|}(x)=1)\geq 2/3&lt;/math&gt;
* For all ''x'' not in ''L'', &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Pr}(Q_{|x|}(x)=0)\geq 2/3&lt;/math&gt;

== Quantum computation ==
The number of [[qubit]]s in the computer is allowed to be a [[polynomial function]] of the instance size.
For example, algorithms are known for factoring an ''n''-bit integer using just over 2''n'' qubits ([[Shor's algorithm]]).

Usually, computation on a quantum computer ends with a [[Measurement in quantum mechanics|measurement]]. This leads to a [[Wavefunction collapse|collapse]] of quantum state to one of the [[Quantum state|basis states]]. It can be said that the quantum state is measured to be in the correct state with high probability.

Quantum computers have gained widespread interest because some problems of practical interest are known to be in '''BQP''', but suspected to be outside '''P'''. Some prominent examples are:
*[[Integer factorization]] (see [[Shor's algorithm]])&lt;ref name=&quot;Shor&quot;&gt;[http://www.arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9508027 arXiv:quant-ph/9508027v2 ''Polynomial-Time Algorithms for Prime Factorization and Discrete Logarithms on a Quantum Computer'', Peter W. Shor]&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Discrete logarithm]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Shor&quot;/&gt;
*Simulation of quantum systems (see [[universal quantum simulator]])
*Computing the [[Jones polynomial]] at certain roots of unity

== Relationship to other complexity classes ==
This class is defined for a quantum computer and its natural corresponding class for an ordinary computer (or a [[Turing machine]] plus a source of randomness) is '''[[Bounded-error probabilistic polynomial|BPP]]'''. Just like '''P''' and '''BPP''', '''BQP''' is low for itself, which means '''BQP'''&lt;sup&gt;'''BQP'''&lt;/sup&gt; = '''BQP'''. Informally, this is true because polynomial time algorithms are closed under composition. If a polynomial time algorithm calls as a subroutine polynomially many polynomial time algorithms, the resulting algorithm is still polynomial time.

'''BQP''' contains '''[[P (complexity)|P]]''' and '''[[Bounded-error probabilistic polynomial|BPP]]''' and is contained in '''[[Almost Wide Probabilistic Polynomial-Time|AWPP]]''',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1=Fortnow | first1=Lance | last2=Rogers | first2=John | title=Complexity limitations on Quantum computation | url=http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~fortnow/papers/quantum.pdf | publisher=[[Academic Press]] | location=Boston, MA | year=1999 | journal=J.

[http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~vazirani/bv.ps]&lt;/ref&gt;
In fact, '''BQP''' is [[low (complexity)|low]] for '''PP''', meaning that a '''PP''' machine achieves no benefit from being able to solve '''BQP''' problems instantly, an indication of the possible difference in power between these similar classes.
:&lt;math&gt;\mbox{P} \subseteq \mbox{BPP} \subseteq \mbox{BQP}\subseteq \mbox{AWPP} \subseteq \mbox{PP} \subseteq \mbox{PSPACE}&lt;/math&gt;

As the problem of '''P''' ≟ '''PSPACE''' has not yet been solved, the proof of inequality between '''BQP''' and classes mentioned above is supposed to be difficult.&lt;ref name=BernVazi/&gt; The relation between '''BQP''' and '''[[NP (complexity)|NP]]''' is not known.

Adding [[postselection]] to '''BQP''' results in the complexity class '''[[PostBQP]]''' which is equal to '''[[PP (complexity)|PP]]'''.&lt;ref name=&quot;PostBQP=PP&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Aaronson|first=Scott|year=2005|title=Quantum computing, postselection, and probabilistic polynomial-time|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society A|volume=461|issue=2063|pages=3473–3482|doi=10.1098/rspa.2005.1546}}.

'''''Blade Runner 2: The Edge of Human''''' (1995) is a [[novel]] by [[K. W. Jeter]], and a continuation of both the film ''[[Blade Runner]]'', and the novel upon which it was based, [[Philip K. Dick]]'s ''[[Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?]]''

==Plot==
Beginning several months after the events in ''[[Blade Runner]]'', Deckard has retired to an isolated shack outside the city, taking the replicant Rachael with him in a Tyrell transport container, which slows down the replicant aging process. He is approached by a woman who explains she is Sarah Tyrell, niece of Eldon Tyrell, heiress to the entire Tyrell Corporation and the human template (''templant'') for the Rachael replicant. She asks Deckard to hunt down the &quot;missing&quot; sixth replicant.  At the same time, the human templant for Roy Batty hires Dave Holden, the blade runner attacked by Leon, to help him hunt down the man he believes is the sixth replicant - Deckard.

Deckard and Holden's investigations lead them to re-visit Sebastian, Bryant, and John Isidore (from the book ''Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep?''), learning more about the nature of the blade runners and the replicants.  

When Deckard, Batty, and Holden finally clash, Batty's inhuman fighting prowess leads Holden to believe he has been duped all along and that Batty is the sixth replicant; he shoots him.  Deckard returns to Sarah with his suspicion: there is ''no'' sixth replicant.  Sarah, speaking via a remote camera, confesses that she created and maintained the rumor herself, to deliberately discredit and eventually destroy the Tyrell Corporation, after her uncle Eldon created Rachael based on her and then abandoned the real Sarah.  Sarah brings Rachael back to the Corporation building to meet with Deckard, and he escapes with her.  

However, Holden - recovering from his injuries during the fight - later finds the truth: Rachael has been killed by Tyrell agents, and the &quot;Rachael&quot; who escaped with Deckard was actually Sarah.  She has completed her revenge by both destroying Tyrell, and taking back Rachael's place.

==Characters==
*Rick Deckard: The Tyrell Corporation finally locates him, residing at a cabin in the woods with the frozen Rachael. In exchange for getting Rachael back, Deckard agrees to hunt the missing sixth replicant.
*Roy Batty: The man which Tyrell used as the template for his combat replicants is in fact a man of considerable instability, suffering from a brain disorder that prevents him from experiencing fear.
*Sarah Tyrell: The niece of Eldon Tyrell, Sarah locates and hires Deckard to eliminate the final replicant in order to retain her corporation's hold over the market.
*Dave Holden: Starting off bed-ridden after his attack by the replicant Leon, Holden is rescued by Roy who in turn leads him to some startling revelations.
*J.R. Isidore: A lowly employee of a vet's office, Isidore also works as an underground replicant sympathizer, having made modifications to replicants in order to help them escape detection.

==Relationship to other works==
The book's plot draws from other material related to ''Blade Runner'' in a number of ways:
* Deckard, Pris, Sebastian, Leon, Batty, and Holden all appeared in ''[[Blade Runner]]''.
* Many of the parts of the &quot;conspiracy&quot; are based on errors or plot holes identified by fans of the original movie, such as Leon's ability to bring a gun into the Tyrell building, or the reference to the sixth replicant.
* The character of John Isidore, and his &quot;pet hospital&quot;, is taken from Dick's original novel ''[[Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?]]'', although that book contained no suggestion that the shop ran a sideline in modifying replicants.
* ''Blade Runner''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Sebastian was based on ''Electric Sheep''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Isidore, though Jeter features them as separate characters in ''The Edge of Human''.
* The idea of replicant models being mass-produced, and in particular a woman identical to Rachael existing, is also from ''[[Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?]]''; although in that book, Pris was the replicant double of Rachael, and there was no suggestion that replicants were constructed based on human templates.
* The etymology of the term &quot;blade runner&quot; is revealed to come from the German phrase ''bleib ruhig'', meaning &quot;remain calm.&quot; It was supposedly developed by the Tyrell Corporation to prevent news about replicants malfunctioning.

However, it also contradicts material in some ways:
* Sebastian was stated as being dead in the movie, yet he is alive in ''The Edge of Human''.
* Pris was clearly stated as being a replicant in both the movie and the original novel, yet ''The Edge of Human'' claims she was human.
* Pris was clearly destroyed by Deckard in both the movie and the original novel. Sebastian's ability to bring Pris back to life as a replicant introduces numerous problems: the book implies that Sebastian somehow was able to do this without realising that her original body was human. It is likewise unclear why Deckard would have left her, or any suspected replicant he retired, in a state from which they could be repaired.
* &quot;The Final Cut&quot; of ''Blade Runner'' removed all reference to a sixth replicant, as it was normally considered a filming goof.

==Reception==
Michael Giltz of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave the book a &quot;C-&quot;, feeling that &quot;[o]nly hardcore fans will be satisfied by this tale&quot; and saying that Jeter's &quot;habit of echoing dialogue and scenes from the film is annoying and begs comparisons he would do well to avoid.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,299536,00.html Review] Michael Giltz, ''Entertainment Weekly'', Nov 17, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; Tal Cohen of ''Tal Cohen's Bookshelf'' called ''The Edge of Human'' &quot;a good book&quot;, praising Jeter's &quot;further, and deeper, investigation of the questions Philip K. Dick originally asked&quot;, but criticized the book for its &quot;needless grandioseness&quot; and for &quot;rel[ying] on ''Blade Runner'' too heavily, [as] the number of new characters introduced is extremely small...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://tal.forum2.org/br2 Review] Tal Cohen, ''Tal Cohen's Bookshelf'', 28 August 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

Ian Kaplan of ''BearCave.com'' gave the book three stars out of five, saying that while he was &quot;not entirely satisified&quot; and felt that the &quot;story tends to be shallow&quot;, &quot;Jeter does deal with the moral dilemma of the Blade Runners who hunt down beings that are virtually human in every way.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bearcave.com/bookrev/brunner2.htm Review] Ian Kaplan, ''BearCave.com'', Feb 1996&lt;/ref&gt; J. Patton of ''The Bent Cover'' praised Jeter for &quot;[not] try[ing] to emulate Philip K. Dick&quot;, adding, &quot;This book also has all the grittiness and dark edges that the movie showed off so well, along with a very fast pace that will keep you reading into the wee hours of the night.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bentcover.com/brblade.htm Review] J. Patton, ''The Bent Cover''&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Infobox programming language|name=brainfuck|file_ext=.b, .bf|paradigm=[[esoteric programming language|esoteric]]|year=1993|designer=Urban Müller|influenced_by=[[P′′]], [[FALSE]]}}
&lt;!-- NOTE: PLEASE do not add wrongtitle or lowercase tags to the top of this article... please see history and talk page for reasons why --&gt;
The '''brainfuck''' programming language is an [[esoteric programming language]] noted for its extreme minimalism. It is a [[Turing tarpit]], designed to challenge and amuse [[programmer]]s, and is not suitable for practical use.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aminet.net/dev/lang/brainfuck-2.readme Urban Müller's classic distribution at aminet.net]&lt;/ref&gt; The name of the language is generally not capitalized except at the start of a sentence, although it is a [[proper noun]].

==Language design==
Urban Müller created brainfuck in 1993 with the intention of designing a language which could be implemented with the smallest possible [[compiler]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.muppetlabs.com/~breadbox/bf/ The Brainfuck Programming Language]&lt;/ref&gt; inspired by the 1024-byte compiler for the [[FALSE]] programming language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://strlen.com/false/index.html Wouter's False page]&lt;/ref&gt; Several brainfuck compilers have been made smaller than 200 bytes. The classic distribution is [http://www.aminet.net/package.php?package=dev/lang/brainfuck-2.lha Müller's version 2], containing a compiler for the [[Amiga]], an interpreter, example programs, and a readme document.

The language consists of eight [[command (computing)|command]]s, listed below. A brainfuck program is a sequence of these commands, possibly interspersed with other characters (which are ignored). The commands are executed sequentially, except as noted below; an [[Program Counter|instruction pointer]] begins at the first command, and each command it points to is executed, after which it normally moves forward to the next command. The program terminates when the instruction pointer moves past the last command.

The brainfuck language uses a simple machine model consisting of the program and instruction pointer, as well as an array of at least 30,000 [[byte]] cells initialized to zero; a movable [[pointer (computing)|data pointer]] (initialized to point to the leftmost byte of the array); and two streams of bytes for input and output (most often connected to a keyboard and a monitor respectively, and using the [[ASCII]] character encoding).

===Commands===
The eight language commands, each consisting of a single character:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!align=&quot;center&quot;|Character
!align=&quot;left&quot;|Meaning
|-
|style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;|&lt;code&gt;&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
||increment the data pointer (to point to the next cell to the right).
|-
|style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;|&lt;code&gt;&lt;&lt;/code&gt;
||decrement the data pointer (to point to the next cell to the left).
|-
|style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;|&lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt;
||increment (increase by one) the byte at the data pointer.
|-
|style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;|&lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt;
||decrement (decrease by one) the byte at the data pointer.
|-
|style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;|&lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt;
||output a character, the ASCII value of which being the byte at the data pointer.
|-
|style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;|&lt;code&gt;,&lt;/code&gt;
||accept one byte of input, storing its value in the byte at the data pointer.
|-
|style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;|&lt;code&gt;[&lt;/code&gt;
||if the byte at the data pointer is zero, then instead of moving the [[Program Counter|instruction pointer]] forward to the next command, [[Branch (computer science)|jump]] it ''forward'' to the command after the ''matching'' &lt;code&gt;]&lt;/code&gt; command&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;.
|-
|style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;|&lt;code&gt;]&lt;/code&gt;
||if the byte at the data pointer is nonzero, then instead of moving the instruction pointer forward to the next command, jump it ''back'' to the command after the ''matching'' &lt;code&gt;[&lt;/code&gt; command&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;.
|}

(Alternatively, the '']'' command may instead be translated as an unconditional jump '''to''' the corresponding ''['' command, or vice versa; programs will behave the same but will run more slowly, due to unnecessary double searching.)

&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;''['' and '']'' match as parentheses usually do: each ''['' matches exactly one '']'' and vice versa, the ''['' comes first, and there can be no unmatched ''['' or '']'' between the two.

Brainfuck programs can be translated into [[C (programming language)|C]] using the following substitutions, assuming &lt;code&gt;ptr&lt;/code&gt; is of type &lt;code&gt;unsigned char*&lt;/code&gt; and has been initialized to point to an array of zeroed bytes:
{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!align=&quot;center&quot;  |brainfuck command
!align=&quot;left&quot; |C equivalent
|-
|style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;|&lt;code&gt;&gt;&lt;/code&gt; || &lt;code&gt;++ptr;&lt;/code&gt;
|-
|style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;|&lt;code&gt;&lt;&lt;/code&gt; || &lt;code&gt;--ptr;&lt;/code&gt;
|-
|style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;|&lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; || &lt;code&gt;++*ptr;&lt;/code&gt;
|-
|style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;|&lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt; || &lt;code&gt;--*ptr;&lt;/code&gt;
|-
|style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;|&lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt; || &lt;code&gt;putchar(*ptr);&lt;/code&gt;
|-
|style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;|&lt;code&gt;,&lt;/code&gt; || &lt;code&gt;*ptr=getchar();&lt;/code&gt;
|-
|style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;|&lt;code&gt;[&lt;/code&gt; || &lt;code&gt;while (*ptr) {&lt;/code&gt;
|-
|style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;|&lt;code&gt;]&lt;/code&gt; || &lt;code&gt;}&lt;/code&gt;
|}

As the name suggests, brainfuck programs tend to be difficult to comprehend. This is partly because any mildly complex task requires a long sequence of commands; partly it is because the program's text gives no direct indications of the program's [[state (computer science)|state]]. These, as well as brainfuck's inefficiency and its limited input/output capabilities, are some of the reasons it is not used for serious programming. Nonetheless, like any [[Turing completeness|Turing-complete]] language, brainfuck is theoretically capable of computing any computable function or simulating any other computational model, if given access to an unlimited amount of memory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iwriteiam.nl/Ha_bf_Turing.html BF is Turing-complete]&lt;/ref&gt; A variety of brainfuck programs have been written.&lt;ref&gt;[http://esoteric.sange.fi/brainfuck/bf-source/prog/ The Brainfuck Archive]&lt;/ref&gt; Although brainfuck programs, especially complicated ones, are difficult to write, it is quite trivial to write an interpreter for brainfuck in a more typical language such as C due to its simplicity. It is possible to write a brainfuck interpreter in the brainfuck language itself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iwriteiam.nl/Ha_bf_inter.html Brainfuck interpreter written in brainfuck]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Brainfuck's formal &quot;parent language&quot; ===

Except for its two I/O commands, brainfuck is a minor variation of the formal programming language [[P′′]] created by [[Corrado Böhm]] in 1964.  In fact, using six symbols equivalent to the respective brainfuck commands &lt;tt&gt;+, -, &lt;, &gt;, [, ],&lt;/tt&gt; Böhm provided an explicit program for each of the basic functions that together serve to compute any [[computable function]].  So in a very real sense, the first &quot;brainfuck&quot; programs appear in Böhm's 1964 paper &amp;ndash; and they were programs sufficient to prove Turing-completeness.

== Examples ==
{{example farm|date=January 2011}}

=== Hello World! ===

The following program prints [[Hello world program|&quot;Hello World!&quot;]] and a newline to the screen:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bf&quot;&gt; 
+++++ +++++             initialize counter (cell #0) to 10
[                       use loop to set the next four cells to 70/100/30/10
    &gt; +++++ ++              add  7 to cell #1
    &gt; +++++ +++++           add 10 to cell #2 
    &gt; +++                   add  3 to cell #3
    &gt; +                     add  1 to cell #4
    &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; -                  decrement counter (cell #0)
]                   
&gt; ++ .                  print 'H'
&gt; + .                   print 'e'
+++++ ++ .              print 'l'
.                       print 'l'
+++ .                   print 'o'
&gt; ++ .                  print ' '
&lt;&lt; +++++ +++++ +++++ .  print 'W'
&gt; .                     print 'o'
+++ .                   print 'r'
----- - .               print 'l'
----- --- .             print 'd'
&gt; + .                   print '!'
&gt; .                     print '\n'
&lt;/source&gt;

For readability, this code has been spread across many lines and blanks and comments have been added. Brainfuck ignores all characters except the eight commands &lt;code&gt;+-&lt;&gt;[],.&lt;/code&gt; so no special syntax for comments is needed (as long as the comments don't contain the command characters). The code could just as well have been written as:
&lt;source lang=&quot;bf&quot;&gt; ++++++++++[&gt;+++++++&gt;++++++++++&gt;+++&gt;+&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;-]&gt;++.&gt;+.+++++++..+++.&gt;++.&lt;&lt;+++++++++++++++.&gt;.+++.------.--------.&gt;+.&gt;.&lt;/source&gt;

The first line initialises &lt;code&gt;a[0] = 10&lt;/code&gt; by simply incrementing ten times from 0. The loop from line 2 effectively sets the initial values for the array: &lt;tt&gt;a[1] = 70&lt;/tt&gt; (close to 72, the [[ASCII]] code for the character 'H'), &lt;code&gt;a[2] = 100&lt;/code&gt; (close to 101 or 'e'), &lt;code&gt;a[3] = 30&lt;/code&gt; (close to 32, the code for space) and &lt;code&gt;a[4] = 10&lt;/code&gt; (newline). The loop works by multiplying the value of &lt;code&gt;a[0]&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;10&lt;/code&gt;, by 7, 10, 3, and 1, saving the results in other cells. After the loop is finished, a[0] is zero. &lt;code&gt;&gt;++.&lt;/code&gt; then moves the pointer to &lt;code&gt;a[1]&lt;/code&gt; which holds &lt;code&gt;70&lt;/code&gt;, adds two to it (producing 72 which is the ASCII character code of a capital H), and outputs it.

The next line moves the array pointer to &lt;code&gt;a[2]&lt;/code&gt; and adds one to it, producing &lt;code&gt;101&lt;/code&gt;, a lower-case 'e', which is then output.

As 'l' happens to be the seventh letter after 'e', to output 'll' another seven are added (&lt;code&gt;+++++++&lt;/code&gt;) to &lt;code&gt;a[2]&lt;/code&gt; and the result is output twice.

'o' is the third letter after 'l', so &lt;code&gt;a[2]&lt;/code&gt; is incremented three more times and output the result.

The rest of the program goes on in the same way. For the space and capital letters, different array cells are selected and incremented or decremented as needed.

===Trivial===
====Cell-clear====

&lt;source lang=&quot;bf&quot;&gt; [-]&lt;/source&gt;

A simple program fragment that sets the value at the current location to 0, by iteratively decrementing until it is equal to 0.

====Clear previous cells====

&lt;source lang=&quot;bf&quot;&gt; [
     [-]
     &lt;
 ]&lt;/source&gt;

Clears the current cell and all those before it, stopping at the first 0 value.

====Rewind====

&lt;source lang=&quot;bf&quot;&gt; [&lt;]&gt;&lt;/source&gt;

Decrements the data pointer until 0 is found, then increments it so the current cell is non-zero.

====Fast-forward====

&lt;source lang=&quot;bf&quot;&gt; [&gt;]&lt;&lt;/source&gt;

Increments the data pointer until a 0 value is found, then decrements it so the current cell is non-zero.

====Simple loop====

&lt;source lang=&quot;bf&quot;&gt; ,[.,]&lt;/source&gt;

A continuous loop that takes text input from the keyboard and echoes it to the screen (similar to the Unix [[cat (Unix)|cat]] program). Note that this assumes the cell is set to 0 when a ',' command is executed after the end of input (sometimes called end-of-file or &quot;EOF&quot;); implementations vary on this point. For implementations that set the cell to -1 on EOF, or leave the cell's value unchanged, this program would be written
&lt;source lang=&quot;bf&quot;&gt;,+[-.,+]&lt;/source&gt;
or
&lt;source lang=&quot;bf&quot;&gt;,[.[-],]&lt;/source&gt;
respectively.

====Moving the pointer====

&lt;source lang=&quot;bf&quot;&gt; &gt;,[.&gt;,]&lt;/source&gt;

A version of the last one that also saves all the input in the array for future use, by moving the pointer each time.

====Add====

&lt;source lang=&quot;bf&quot;&gt; [
     -&gt;   cell #0: before loop: left addend; after loop: 0
     +&lt;   cell #1: before loop: right addend; after loop: sum
 ]&lt;/source&gt;
This adds the current location (destructively, as its value is zeroed in the process) to the next location.

&lt;source lang=&quot;bf&quot;&gt; [        counter is cell #0
     -    cell #0
     &gt;+   cell #1
     &gt;+   cell #2
     &lt;&lt;
 ]
 &gt;&gt;       
 [        loop to restore value of cell #0; counter is cell #2
     -    cell #2
     &lt;&lt;+  cell #0
     &gt;&gt;   cell #2
 ]&lt;/source&gt;
This code will not destroy the original value (in cell #0), but it is 1.5 times more memory hungry than the previous example, requiring 3 bytes of memory

====Conditional loop statements====

&lt;source lang=&quot;bf&quot;&gt; ,----------[----------------------.,----------]&lt;/source&gt;

This program will take lowercase input from the keyboard and make it uppercase, exiting when the user presses the enter key. It requires only one cell of memory, into which the user repeatedly enters keystrokes. If any of the keystrokes is the [[newline]] character&amp;mdash;that is, the user presses the enter key&amp;mdash;most brainfuck implementations will return the value 10. When the result of&lt;source lang=&quot;bf&quot;&gt; ,&lt;/source&gt; is 10, interpreting the segment&lt;source lang=&quot;bf&quot;&gt; ,----------&lt;/source&gt; will cause the cell's value to be 0. In this case, the program will fail to enter to the loop and terminate.

On the other hand, if the character input was not a 10, the program boldly assumes it was a lowercase letter and enters the loop, wherein it subtracts another 22 from the input. This yields a total deduction of 32, which is the difference between an ASCII lowercase letter and the corresponding uppercase letter (for example, lowercase f = ASCII 102 and uppercase F = ASCII 70). The result of all this arithmetic is realized when the uppercase character is outputted.

Next the segment&lt;source lang=&quot;bf&quot;&gt; ,----------&lt;/source&gt; is repeated, putting a keystroke's value in the cell and subtracting 10. It has the same effect as before: if the inputted character is a linefeed, the loop is exited and the program terminates. Otherwise, the interpreter goes back to the start of the loop, subtracts another 22, outputs, and so on.

====Copying a byte====

In the following section, [n] denotes the ''n''th byte in the array: [0], [1], [2] and so on.

Brainfuck does not include an operation for copying [[byte]]s. This must be done with the looping construct and arithmetical operators. Moving a byte is simple enough; moving the value of [0] to [1] can be done as follows:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bf&quot;&gt; &gt;[-]&lt;[-&gt;+&lt;]&lt;/source&gt;

However, this resets the value of [0] to 0. The value of [0] can be restored after copying by taking advantage of the ability to copy a value to two places at once. To copy the value of [0] to both [1] and [2] is simple:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bf&quot;&gt; &gt;[-]&gt;[-]&lt;&lt;[-&gt;+&gt;+&lt;&lt;]&lt;/source&gt;

This can be used to restore the value of [0]. Therefore, [0] can be nondestructively copied to [1] (using [2] as scratch space) as follows:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bf&quot;&gt; &gt;[-]&gt;[-]&lt;&lt;[-&gt;+&gt;+&lt;&lt;]&gt;&gt;[-&lt;&lt;+&gt;&gt;]&lt;&lt;&lt;/source&gt;

====Seek====

&lt;source lang=&quot;bf&quot;&gt; -[+&gt;-]+&lt;/source&gt;

Moves the pointer forward until it lands on a byte with a value of 1, preserving all bytes it passes; then it stops. To find other values, repeat each + and - that number of times. To seek a cell with a value of 10:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bf&quot;&gt; ----------[++++++++++&gt;----------]++++++++++&lt;/source&gt;

Likewise, to search backward for a value of 10:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bf&quot;&gt; ----------[++++++++++&lt;----------]++++++++++&lt;/source&gt;

=== Arithmetic ===
==== Addition ====

&lt;source lang=&quot;bf&quot;&gt; ,&gt;++++++[&lt;--------&gt;-],[&lt;+&gt;-]&lt;.&lt;/source&gt;

This program adds two single-digit numbers and displays the result correctly if the result also has only one digit:

 43

 7

The first number is input in [0], and 48 is subtracted from it to correct it (the ASCII codes for the digits 0-9 are 48-57). This is done by putting a 6 in [1] and using a loop to subtract 8 from [0] that many times. (This is a common method of adding or subtracting large numbers.) Next, the second number is input in [1].

The next loop &lt;code&gt;[&lt;+&gt;-]&lt;/code&gt; does the real work, moving the second number onto the first, adding them together and zeroing [1]. Each time through, it adds one to [0] and subtracts one from [1]; so by the time [1] is zeroed, as many have been added to [0] as have been removed from [1]. Now a return is input in [1]. (We're not error-checking the input at all.)

Then the pointer is moved back to the [0], which is then output. ([0] is now a + (b + 48), since b isn't corrected; which is identical to (a + b) + 48, which is the desired result.) Now the pointer is moved to [1], which holds the return that was input; it is now outputted, and the program is complete.

Apparently, some implementations prefer this variant which does not use linefeeds at all:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bf&quot;&gt; ,&gt;------[&lt;--------&gt;+],[&lt;+&gt;-]&lt;.&lt;/source&gt;

==== Multiplication ====

&lt;source lang=&quot;bf&quot;&gt; ,&gt;,&gt;++++++++[&lt;------&lt;------&gt;&gt;-]
 &lt;&lt;[&gt;[&gt;+&gt;+&lt;&lt;-]&gt;&gt;[&lt;&lt;+&gt;&gt;-]&lt;&lt;&lt;-]
 &gt;&gt;&gt;++++++[&lt;++++++++&gt;-]&lt;.&gt;.&lt;/source&gt;

Like the previous, but does multiplication, not addition.

The first number is input in [0], the second number is input in [1], and both numbers are corrected by having 48 subtracted.

Now the program enters the main multiplication loop. The basic idea is that each time through it subtracts one from [0] and adds [1] to the running total kept in [2]. In particular: the first inner loop moves [1] onto both [2] and [3], while zeroing [1]. (This is the basic way to duplicate a number.) The next inner loop moves [3] back into [1], zeroing [3]. Then one is subtracted from [0], and the outer loop is ended. On exiting this loop, [0] is zero, [1] still has the second number in it, and [2] has the product of the two numbers. (Had the first number needed to be kept, the program could have added one to [4] each time through the outer loop, then moved the value from [4] back to [0] afterward.)

Now 48 is added to the product, a return is input as [3], the [[ASCII]]fied product is output, followed by the return just stored.

==== Division ====
This example accepts two single-digit numbers from the user, divides them, and displays the truncated quotient (i.e. integer division). The dividend is stored in memory location (0) and the divisor is stored in (1) The code then enters the main loop. With each iteration of the loop, the code subtracts the divisor from the dividend. If the difference is greater than zero, the cell holding the quotient is incremented, and the process repeated until the dividend reaches zero. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;bf&quot;&gt; 
,&gt;,&gt;++++++[-&lt;--------&lt;--------&gt;&gt;] Store 2 numbers from keyboard in (0) and (1);
                                  and subtract 48 from each
&lt;&lt;[                               This is the main loop which continues until
                                  the dividend in (0) is zero
&gt;[-&gt;+&gt;+&lt;&lt;]                        Destructively copy the divisor from (1) to (2)
                                  and (3); setting (1) to zero
&gt;[-&lt;&lt;-                            Subtract the divisor in (2) from the dividend
                                  in (0); the difference is stored in (0) and
                                  (2) is cleared
[&gt;]&gt;&gt;&gt;[&lt;[&gt;&gt;&gt;-&lt;&lt;&lt;[-]]&gt;&gt;]&lt;&lt;]        If the dividend in (0) is zero; exit the loop
&gt;&gt;&gt;+                              Add one to the quotient in (5)
&lt;&lt;[-&lt;&lt;+&gt;&gt;]                        Destructively copy the divisor in (3) to (1)
&lt;&lt;&lt;]                              Move the stack pointer to (0) and go back to
                                  the start of the main loop
&gt;[-]&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;[-&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;+&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;]            Destructively copy the quotient in (5) to (0)
                                  (not necessary; but cleaner)
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;++++++[-&lt;++++++++&gt;]&lt;.         Add 48 and print result
&lt;/source&gt;

==Portability issues==

Partly because Urban Müller did not write a thorough language specification, the many subsequent brainfuck interpreters and compilers have come to use slightly different dialects of brainfuck.

===Cell size===

In [http://wuarchive.wustl.edu/pub/aminet/dev/lang/brainfuck-2.lha the classic distribution], the cells are of 8-bit size (cells are bytes), and this is still the most common size. However, to read non-textual data, a brainfuck program may need to distinguish an [[end-of-file]] condition from any possible byte value; thus 16-bit cells have also been used. Some implementations have used 32-bit cells, 64-bit cells, or [[bignum]] cells with practically unlimited range, but programs that use this extra range are likely to be slow, since storing the value ''n'' into a cell requires [[Big O notation#Related asymptotic notations|Ω]](''n'') time as a cell’s value may only be changed by incrementing and decrementing.

In all these variants, the &lt;code&gt;,&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt; commands still read and write data in bytes. In most of them, the cells wrap around, i.e. incrementing a cell which holds its maximal value (with the &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; command) will bring it to its minimal value and vice versa. The exceptions are implementations which are distant from the underlying hardware, implementations that use bignums, and implementations that try to enforce portability.

Fortunately, it is usually easy to write brainfuck programs that do not ever cause integer wraparound or overflow, and therefore don't depend on cell size. Generally this means avoiding increment of +255 (unsigned 8-bit wraparound), or avoiding overstepping the boundaries of [-128, +127] (signed 8-bit wraparound) (since there are no comparison operators, a program cannot distinguish between a signed and unsigned [[two's complement]] fixed-bit-size cell and negativeness of numbers is a matter of interpretation). For more details on integer wraparound, see the [[Integer overflow]] article.

===Array size===

In the classic distribution, the array has 30,000 cells, and the pointer begins at the leftmost cell. Even more cells are needed to store things like the millionth [[Fibonacci number]], and the easiest way to make the language Turing-complete is to make the array unlimited on the right.

A few implementations{{which?|date=September 2010}} extend the array to the left as well; this is an uncommon feature, and therefore portable brainfuck programs do not depend on it.

When the pointer moves outside the bounds of the array, some implementations will give an error message, some will try to extend the array dynamically, some will not notice and will produce [[undefined behavior]], and a few will move the pointer to the opposite end of the array. Some tradeoffs are involved: expanding the array dynamically to the right is the most user-friendly approach and is good for memory-hungry programs, but it carries a speed penalty. If a fixed-size array is used it is helpful to make it very large, or better yet let the user set the size. Giving an error message for bounds violations is very useful for debugging but even that carries a speed penalty unless it can be handled by the operating system's memory protections.

===End-of-line code===

Different operating systems (and sometimes different programming environments) use subtly different versions of ASCII. The most important difference is in the code used for the end of a line of text. MS-DOS and Microsoft Windows use a [[Newline#Representations|CRLF]], i.e. a 13 followed by a 10, in most contexts. UNIX and its descendants, including Linux and Mac OS X, use just 10, and older Macs use just 13. It would be unfortunate if brainfuck programs had to be rewritten for different operating systems. Fortunately, a unified standard is easy to find. Urban Müller's compiler and his example programs use 10, on both input and output; so do a large majority of existing brainfuck programs; and 10 is also more convenient to use than CRLF. Thus, brainfuck implementations should make sure that brainfuck programs that assume newline=10 will run properly; many do so, but some do not.

This assumption is also consistent with most of the world's sample code for [[C (programming language)|C]] and other languages, in that they use '\n', or 10, for their newlines. On systems that use CRLF line endings, the C standard library transparently remaps &quot;\n&quot; to &quot;\r\n&quot; on output and &quot;\r\n&quot; to &quot;\n&quot; on input for streams not opened in binary mode.

===End-of-file behavior===

The behavior of the &lt;code&gt;,&lt;/code&gt; command when an [[end-of-file]] condition has been encountered varies. Some implementations set the cell at the pointer to 0, some set it to the C constant EOF (in practice this is usually -1), some leave the cell's value unchanged. There is no real consensus; arguments for the three behaviors are as follows.

Setting the cell to 0 avoids the use of negative numbers, and makes it marginally more concise to write a loop that reads characters until EOF occurs. This is a language extension devised by Panu Kalliokoski.

Setting the cell to -1 allows EOF to be distinguished from any byte value (if the cells are larger than bytes), which is necessary for reading non-textual data; also, it is the behavior of the C translation of &lt;code&gt;,&lt;/code&gt; given in Müller's readme file. However, it is not obvious that those C translations are to be taken as normative.

Leaving the cell's value unchanged is the behavior of Urban Müller's brainfuck compiler. This behavior can easily coexist with either of the others; for instance, a program that assumes EOF=0 can set the cell to 0 before each &lt;code&gt;,&lt;/code&gt; command, and will then work correctly on implementations that do either EOF=0 or EOF=&quot;no change&quot;. It is so easy to accommodate the &quot;no change&quot; behavior that any brainfuck programmer interested in portability should do so.

===Miscellaneous dialects===

Many people have modified brainfuck in order to produce their own languages, often by adding commands, occasionally by removing them. Many of the resulting languages are included in the [http://esoteric.voxelperfect.net/wiki/Category:Brainfuck_derivatives brainfuck derivatives] list on the Esoteric Languages wiki. However, there are also unnamed minor variants, formed possibly as a result of inattention, of which some of the more common are:
* forbidding, rather than ignoring, any non-command characters in brainfuck programs
* introducing a comment marker which comments out the rest of the line
* various alterations of the loop semantics, sometimes destroying [[Turing completeness]]
* requiring a special character to mark the end of the program

'''Bartolomeo Ammannati''' (June 18, 1511 – April 13, 1592) was an Italian [[architect]] and [[Sculpture|sculptor]], born at [[Settignano]], near [[Florence]]. He studied under [[Baccio Bandinelli]] and [[Jacopo Sansovino]] (assisting on the Library of St. Mark's, the ''[[Biblioteca Marciana]]'', Venice) and closely imitated the style of [[Michelangelo]].

He was more distinguished in architecture than in sculpture.  He designed many buildings in [[Rome]], which included work at the [[Villa Giulia]] complex (in collaboration with [[Giacomo Barozzi da Vignola|Vignola]] and [[Vasari]]), also at  [[Lucca]] and Florence.  His work at the completion of [[Pitti Palace]], commissioned by Eleonora of Toledo, wife of [[Cosimo I]], is one of his most celebrated achievements (1558–1570), respecting the original style of [[Filippo Brunelleschi]]. He was also named ''Console'' of the prestigious [[Accademia delle Arti del Disegno]] of Florence, founded by the Duke Cosimo I, at 13 January 1563, under the influence of Vasari.

He was then employed in 1569 to build the beautiful bridge over the [[Arno]], known as [[Ponte Santa Trinita]] and one of his most celebrated works.  The three arches are elliptic, and though very light and elegant, have resisted the fury of the river, which has swept away several other bridges at different times.  It was destroyed in 1944, during World War II, and rebuilt in 1957.

Another of his most important works was the marble and bronze ''[[Fountain of Neptune]]'' (''Fontana del Nettuno'') for the [[Piazza della Signoria]]. The assignment was originally given to the ageing [[Bartolommeo Bandinelli]]. On his death, Ammannati won the competition for the continuing of this assignment over other famous sculptors, such as [[Benvenuto Cellini]] and [[Vincenzo Danti]]. He worked between 1563 and 1565 on the original block of marble (chosen by Bandinelli), together with his assistants, among which [[Giambologna]]. He took Grand Duke [[Cosimo I]] as model for Neptune's face. When the work on the ungainly sea god was finished, [[Michelangelo]] scoffed at Ammannati that he had ruined a beautiful piece of marble: &quot;Ammannati, Ammanato, che bell' marmo hai rovinato!&quot;  Ammannati continued working on this fountain for another ten years, adding, in a [[mannerist]] style,  around the perimeter suave bronze reclining river gods,  laughing [[satyr]]s and marble sea horses emerging from the water. The whole gives nevertheless a coherent impression. The fountain served as an example for future fountain-makers.

Other famous sculptures by Ammannati include:
* the marble statue ''Victory'' (1540), [[Museo Nazionale del Bargello]], Florence
* the marble statue ''[[Leda (mythology)|Leda]] with the Swan'' in the Museo Nazionale del Bargello in Florence.
* the bronze statue of [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] (1558–59), in the [[Prado Museum]] ([[Madrid]], [[Spain]]).
* the marble statue ''Parnassus'' (1563), Museo Nazionale del Bargello, Florence
* the stone statue ''Allegory of Winter'' (1563–65), [[Villa Medici]], Castello
* the bronze statue ''Goddess Opi'' (1572–75), [[Palazzo Vecchio]], Florence

In 1550 Ammannati married [[Laura Battiferri]], an elegant poet and an accomplished woman. Later in his life he had a religious crisis, influenced by [[Counter-Reformation]] piety, which resulted in condemning his own works depicting [[nudity]], and he left all his possessions to the [[Jesuits]].

He died in Florence in 1592.

A '''bishop''' is an [[ordination|ordained]] or [[consecration|consecrated]] member of the [[Clergy#Christian clergy|Christian clergy]] who is generally entrusted with a position of authority and oversight. Within the [[Catholic Church]], [[Eastern Orthodox]], [[Oriental Orthodox]] Churches, in the [[Assyrian Church of the East]], in the [[Independent Catholic Churches]], and in the [[Anglican]] churches, bishops claim [[apostolic succession]], a direct historical lineage dating back to the original [[Twelve Apostles]]. Within these churches, bishops can ordain clergy including other bishops. Some [[Protestant]] churches including the [[Lutheran]] and [[Methodist]] churches have bishops serving similar functions as well, though not always understood to be within [[apostolic succession]] in the same way.

The office of bishop was already quite distinct from that of [[priest]] in the writings of [[Ignatius of Antioch]] (died c. 107), and by the middle of the [[Christianity in the 2nd century|2nd century]] all the [[Early centers of Christianity|chief centres of Christianity]] were headed by bishops, a form of organization that remained universal until the [[Protestant Reformation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ODCC self&quot;&gt;&quot;bishop.&quot; Cross, F. L., ed. The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The earliest organization of the [[Christian Church|Church]] in [[Jerusalem in Christianity|Jerusalem]] was similar to that of [[Judaism|Jewish]] [[synagogue]]s, which were governed by a council of elders ({{lang-el|πρεσβύτεροι}} ''presbyteroi''). In [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] 11:30 and 15:22, we see this collegiate system of government in Jerusalem, and, in Acts 14:23, the [[Paul of Tarsus|Apostle Paul]] ordains [[Elder (Christianity)|elders]] in the churches he founded.

[[Presbyters]] were apparently identical to '''overseers''' (ἐπίσκοποι ''episkopoi'', i.e., '''bishops'''), as in Acts 20:17, [[Epistle to Titus|Titus]] 1:5,7 and [[1 Peter]] 5:1.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church, 1997 edition revised 2005, page 211: &quot;It seems that at first the terms 'episcopos' and 'presbyter' were used interchangeably ...&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cambridge History of Christianity, volume 1, 2006, &quot;The general consensus among scholars has been that, at the turn of the first and second centuries, local congregations were led by bishops and presbyters whose offices were overlapping or indistinguishable.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest writings of the [[Apostolic Fathers]], the [[Didache]] and the [[First Epistle of Clement]] for example, show the church recognized two local church offices—elders (interchangeable term with overseer) and [[deacon]].

[[File:Augustine Lateran.jpg|thumb|left|170px|A 6th-century image [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]], bishop of [[Hippo Regius]].]]
The beginnings of a single ruling bishop can perhaps be traced to the offices occupied by [[Saint Timothy|Timothy]] and [[Titus (Biblical)|Titus]] in the New Testament. We are told that Paul had left Timothy in [[Early centers of Christianity#Western Anatolia|Ephesus]] and Titus in [[Crete]] to oversee the local church (1 Tim. 1:3 and Titus 1:5). Paul commands them to ordain presbyters/bishops and to exercise general oversight, telling Titus to &quot;rebuke with all authority&quot; (Titus 2:15).

Various Christian communities would have had a group of presbyter-bishops functioning as leaders of the local church. Eventually this evolved into a ''monarchical episcopacy'' in certain cities.&lt;ref name=&quot;O'Grady 140&quot;&gt;{{cite book |first=John |last=O'Grady |title=The Roman Catholic church: its origins and nature |page=140}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''monarchical episcopacy'' probably developed in other churches in Christianity before it took shape in Rome. For example, it has been conjectured that [[Early centers of Christianity#Antioch|Antioch]] may have been one of the first Christian communities to have adopted such a structure.&lt;ref name=&quot;O'Grady 140&quot;/&gt; The emergence of a single bishop in Rome probably did not arise until the middle of the 2nd century. [[Pope Linus|Linus]], [[Pope Anacletus|Cletus]] and [[Pope Clement I|Clement]] were probably prominent presbyter-bishops but not necessarily ''monarchical bishops''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=John |last=O'Grady |title=The Roman Catholic church: its origins and nature |page=146}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, Rome followed the example of other Christian communities and structured itself after the model of the empire with one presbyter bishop in charge ...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=John |last=O'Grady |title=The Roman Catholic church: its origins and nature |pages=17–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organizational structure subsequently evolved into the present form of one bishop supported by a college of presbyters.&lt;ref name=&quot;O'Grady 140&quot;/&gt;

It is certain that the office of bishop and presbyter were clearly distinguished by the [[Christianity in the 2nd century|2nd century]], as the church was facing the dual pressures of persecution and internal schism, resulting in three distinct local offices: bishop, elder (presbyter) and deacon. This is best seen in the 2nd century writings of St. [[Ignatius of Antioch]].

The bishop was understood mainly as the president of the council of presbyters, and so the bishop came to be distinguished both in honor and in prerogative from the presbyters, who were seen as deriving their authority by means of delegation from the bishop. Each [[Episcopal see]] had its own bishop and his presence was necessary to consecrate any gathering of the church.

Eventually, as [[Christendom]] grew, individual congregations were no longer directly served by a bishop. The bishop in a large city (the [[Metropolitan bishop]]) would appoint a presbyter to pastor the flock in each congregation, acting as his delegate.

===Apostolic Fathers===
Around the end of the [[Christianity in the 1st century|1st century]], the church's organization becomes clearer in historical documents. In the works of the [[Apostolic Fathers]], and [[Ignatius of Antioch]] in particular, the role of the episkopos, or bishop, became more important or, rather, already was very important and being clearly defined.

&lt;blockquote&gt;''&quot;Plainly therefore we ought to regard the bishop as the Lord Himself&quot;'' &amp;mdash; Epistle of Ignatius to the Ephesians 6:1.&lt;br /&gt;
''&quot;your godly bishop&quot;'' &amp;mdash; Epistle of Ignatius to the Magnesians 2:1.&lt;br /&gt;
''&quot;the bishop presiding after the likeness of God and the presbyters after the likeness of the council of the Apostles, with the deacons also who are most dear to me, having been entrusted with the diaconate of Jesus Christ&quot;'' &amp;mdash; Epistle of Ignatius to the Magnesians 6:1.&lt;br /&gt;
''&quot;Therefore as the Lord did nothing without the Father, [being united with Him], either by Himself or by the Apostles, so neither do ye anything without the bishop and the presbyters.&quot;'' &amp;mdash; Epistle of Ignatius to the Magnesians 7:1.&lt;br /&gt;
''&quot;Be obedient to the bishop and to one another, as Jesus Christ was to the Father [according to the flesh], and as the Apostles were to Christ and to the Father, that there may be union both of flesh and of spirit.&quot;'' &amp;mdash; Epistle of Ignatius to the Magnesians 13:2.&lt;br /&gt;
''&quot;In like manner let all men respect the deacons as Jesus Christ, even as they should respect the bishop as being a type of the Father and the presbyters as the council of God and as the college of Apostles. Apart from these there is not even the name of a church.&quot;'' &amp;mdash; [[Epistle of Ignatius to the Trallesians]] 3:1.&lt;br /&gt;
''&quot;follow your bishop, as Jesus Christ followed the Father, and the presbytery as the Apostles; and to the deacons pay respect, as to God's commandment&quot;'' &amp;mdash; [[Epistle of Ignatius to the Smyrnans]] 8:1.&lt;br /&gt;
''&quot;He that honoureth the bishop is honoured of God; he that doeth aught without the knowledge of the bishop rendereth service to the devil&quot;'' &amp;mdash; Epistle of Ignatius to the Smyrnans 9:1.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;&amp;mdash; Lightfoot translation.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It is clear that, by this period, a single bishop was expected to lead the church in each centre of Christian mission, supported by a council of [[presbyter]]s (a distinct and subordinate position at least by this time) with a pool of [[deacon]]s. As the Church continued to expand, new churches in important cities gained their own bishop. Churches in the regions outside an important city were served by [[Chorbishop]], an official rank of bishops. However, soon, presbyters and deacons were sent from bishop of a city church. Graudually priests replaced the chorbishops. Thus, in time, the bishop changed from being the leader of a single church confined to an urban area to being the leader of the churches of a given geographical area.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chorbishop&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Clement of Alexandria]] (end of the 2nd century) writes about the ordination of a certain Zachæus as bishop by the imposition of [[Saint Peter|Simon Peter Bar-Jonah's]] hands. The words bishop and ordination are used in their technical meaning by the same Clement of Alexandria.&lt;ref&gt;Clement, &quot;Hom.&quot;, III, lxxii; cfr. ''[[Stromata]]'', VI, xiii, cvi; cf. &quot;Const. Apost.&quot;, II, viii, 36&lt;/ref&gt; The bishops in the 2nd century are defined also as the only clergy to whom the ordination to [[priest]]hood ([[presbyterate]]) and diaconate is entrusted: &quot;a priest (presbyter) [[Laying on of hands|lays on hands]], but does not [[ordain]].&quot; (''cheirothetei ou cheirotonei''&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Didascalia Syr.&quot;, IV; III, 10, 11, 20; Cornelius, &quot;Ad Fabianum&quot; in Eusebius, ''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Historia Ecclesiastica]]'', VI, xliii.&lt;/ref&gt;)

At the beginning of the 3rd century, [[Hippolytus of Rome]] describes another feature of the ministry of a bishop, which is that of the ''&quot;Spiritum primatus sacerdotii habere potestatem dimittere peccata&quot;'': the primate of sacrificial priesthood and the power to forgive sins.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sspx.ca/Angelus/2006_January/New_Rite_Episcopal_Consecration_Pt2.htm Bernard Botte, O.S.B., La Tradition apostolique de saint Hippolyte: Essai de reconstitution, LQF 39 (Munster-Westfalen, 1963). English Translation added at website.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bishops and civil government==
The efficient organization of the [[Roman Empire]] became the template for the organisation of the church in the [[Christianity in the 4th century|4th century]], particularly after [[Constantine I and Christianity|Constantine's]] [[Edict of Milan]]. As the church moved from the shadows of privacy into the public forum it acquired land for churches, burials and [[clergy]]. In 391, [[Theodosius I]] decreed that any land that had been confiscated from the church by Roman authorities be returned.

The most usual term for the geographic area of a bishop's authority and ministry, the [[diocese]], began as part of the structure of the [[Roman Empire]] under [[Diocletian]]. As Roman authority began to fail in the [[Western Roman Empire|western portion of the empire]], the church took over much of the civil administration. This can be clearly seen in the ministry of two [[pope]]s: [[Pope Leo I]] in the [[Christianity in the 5th century|5th century]], and [[Pope Gregory I]] in the [[Christianity in the 6th century|6th century]]. Both of these men were statesmen and public administrators in addition to their role as Christian pastors, teachers and leaders. In the [[Eastern Roman Empire|Eastern churches]], [[latifundia]] entailed to a bishop's [[Episcopal see|see]] were much less common, the state power did not collapse the way it did in the West, and thus the tendency of bishops acquiring secular power was much weaker than in the West. However, the role of Western bishops as civil authorities, often called [[Prince-Bishop|prince bishops]], continued throughout much of the [[Middle Ages]].

===Bishops holding political office===
As well as being arch chancellors of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], bishops generally served as [[chancellor]]s to medieval monarchs, acting as head of the ''justiciary'' and chief [[chaplain]]. The [[Lord Chancellor]] of [[England]] was almost always a bishop up until the dismissal of Cardinal [[Thomas Wolsey]] by [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]. Likewise, the position of [[Kanclerz]] in the [[Kingdom of Poland (1385–1569)|Polish kingdom]] was always a bishop until the [[Christianity in the 16th century|16th century]].

In [[France]] before the [[French Revolution]], representatives of the clergy &amp;mdash; in practice, bishops and [[abbot]]s of the largest [[monastery|monasteries]] &amp;mdash; comprised the [[First Estate]] of the [[French States-General|Estates-General]], until their role was abolished during the [[French Revolution]].

The more senior bishops of the [[Church of England]] continue to sit in the [[House of Lords]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]], as representatives of the [[established church]], and are known as [[Lords Spiritual]]. The [[Bishop of Sodor and Man]], whose [[diocese]] lies outside of the [[United Kingdom]], is an [[ex officio member]] of the [[Legislative Council of the Isle of Man|Legislative Council]] of the [[Isle of Man]]. In the past, the [[Bishop of Durham]], known as a [[Prince-Bishop|prince bishop]], had extensive viceregal powers within his northern diocese &amp;mdash; the power to mint money, collect taxes and raise an army to defend against the [[Scottish people|Scots]].

[[Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] bishops, along with all other members of the clergy, are [[canon law|canonically]] forbidden to hold political office. Occasional exceptions to this rule are tolerated when the alternative is political chaos. In the [[Ottoman Empire]], the [[Patriarch of Constantinople]], for example, had de facto administrative, fiscal, cultural and legal jurisdiction, as well as spiritual, over all the Christians of the empire. A recent prominent example of this was Archbishop [[Makarios III]] of [[Cyprus]], who served as President of the Republic of Cyprus from 1960 to 1977.

In 2001, [[Peter Hollingworth]], [[List of Companions of the Order of Australia|AC]], [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] – then the [[Anglican]] Archbishop of [[Anglican Diocese of Brisbane|Brisbane]] – was controversially appointed [[Governor-General of Australia]]. Though Hollingworth gave up his episcopal position to accept the appointment, it still attracted considerable opposition in a country which maintains a formal [[Separation of church and state|separation between Church and State]].

===Episcopacy during the English Civil War===
[[File:William Laud.jpg|thumb|[[William Laud]], Charles I's Archbishop of Canterbury.]]
During the period of the [[English Civil War]], the role of bishops as wielders of political power and as upholders of the [[established church]] became a matter of heated political controversy. [[John Calvin]] formulated a doctrine of [[Presbyterianism]], which held that in the New Testament the offices of ''presbyter'' and ''episkopos'' were identical; he rejected the doctrine of [[apostolic succession]]. Calvin's follower [[John Knox]] brought Presbyterianism to [[Scotland]] when the Scottish church was reformed in 1560. In practice, Presbyterianism meant that committees of lay elders had a substantial voice in church government, as opposed to merely being subjects to a ruling [[hierarchy]].

This vision of at least partial [[democracy]] in [[ecclesiology]] paralleled the struggles between [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] and [[List of English monarchs|the King]]. A body within the [[Puritan]] movement in the [[Church of England]] sought to abolish the office of bishop and remake the Church of England along Presbyterian lines. The [[Martin Marprelate]] tracts, applying the [[pejorative]] name of ''[[prelate|prelacy]]'' to the church hierarchy, attacked the office of bishop with satire that deeply offended [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] and her [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] [[John Whitgift]]. The [[vestments controversy]] also related to this movement, seeking further reductions in church ceremony, and labelling the use of elaborate vestments as &quot;unedifying&quot; and even [[idolatry and Christianity|idolatrous]].

[[James I of England|King James I]], reacting against the perceived contumacy of his Presbyterian Scottish subjects, adopted &quot;No Bishop, no King&quot; as a slogan; he tied the hierarchical authority of the bishop to the absolute authority he sought as king, and viewed attacks on the authority of the bishops as attacks on his own authority. Matters came to a head when King [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] appointed [[William Laud]] as the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]; Laud aggressively attacked the Presbyterian movement and sought to impose the full [[Book of Common Prayer|Anglican liturgy]]. The controversy eventually led to Laud's [[impeachment]] for [[treason]] by a [[bill of attainder]] in 1645, and subsequent execution. Charles also attempted to impose episcopacy on Scotland; the Scots' violent rejection of bishops and liturgical worship sparked the [[Bishops' Wars]] in 1639–1640.

During the height of Puritan power in [[Commonwealth of England|the Commonwealth]] and [[the Protectorate]], episcopacy was abolished in the Church of England in 1649. The Church of England remained Presbyterian until the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] of the monarchy with [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] in 1660.

{{Main|Bishop (Catholic Church)}}

Bishops form the leadership in the [[Roman Catholic Church]], the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], the [[Oriental Orthodox Churches]], the [[Anglican Communion]], the [[Lutheran]] Church, the [[Independent Catholic Churches]], the [[Continuing Anglican movement|Independent Anglican Churches]], and certain other, smaller, denominations.

The traditional role of a bishop is as pastor of a [[diocese]] (also called a bishopric, [[synod]], [[eparchy]] or [[episcopal see|see]]), and so to serve as a &quot;diocesan bishop,&quot; or &quot;eparch&quot; as it is called in many Eastern Christian churches. Dioceses vary considerably in size, geographically and population-wise. Some dioceses around the [[Mediterranean Sea]] which were Christianised early are rather compact, whereas dioceses in areas of rapid modern growth in Christian commitment—as in some parts of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], [[South America]] and the [[Far East]]—are much larger and more populous.

As well as traditional diocesan bishops, many churches have a well-developed structure of church leadership that involves a number of layers of authority and responsibility.

;[[Patriarch]]:Patriarchs are the bishops who head certain ancient [[autocephalous]] or [[sui iuris]] churches, which are a collection of [[metropolitan bishop|metropolitan]] [[Episcopal see|see]]s or [[province]]s. After the First Ecumenical Council at Nicea, the church structure was patterned after the administrative divisions of the Roman Empire wherein a metropolitan or bishop of a metropolis came to be the ecclesiastical head of a civil capital of a province or a metropolis. Whereas, the bishop of the larger administrative district, diocese, came to be called an exarch. In a few cases, a bishop came to preside over a number of dioceses, i.e., Rome, Antioch, and Alexandria. At the Fourth Ecumenical Council at Chalcedon in 451, Constantinople was given jurisdiction over three dioceses for the reason that the city was &quot;the residence of the emperor and senate&quot;. Additionally, Jerusalem was recognized at the Council of Chalcedon as one of the major sees. In 692, the Quinisext Council formally recognized and ranked the sees of the Pentarchy in order of preeminence, at that time Rome, Constantinople, Alexandria, Antioch, and Jerusalem. In the Catholic Church, Patriarchs sometimes call their leaders ''Catholicos''; the Patriarch of the Orthodox Church of Alexandria, Egypt, is called ''Pope'', meaning 'Father'. While most patriarchs in the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] have jurisdiction over a &quot;ritual church&quot; (a group or diocese of a particular Eastern tradition), all [[Latin Rite]] patriarchs, except for the [[Pope]], have only honorary titles. In 2006, [[Pope Benedict XVI]] gave up the title of [[Patriarch of the West]]. The first recorded use of the title by a Roman Pope was by [[Pope Theodore I|Theodore I]] in 620. However, early church documents, such as those of the [[First Council of Nicaea]] (325) had always listed the Pope of Rome first among the [[Pentarchy (Christianity)|Ancient Patriarchs]] (first four, and later five: [[Pope|Rome]], [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Constantinople]], [[Patriarch of Alexandria|Alexandria]], [[Patriarch of Antioch|Antioch]] and [[Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem|Jerusalem]]—collectively referred to as the ''Pentarchy''). Later, the heads of various national churches became Patriarchs, but they are ranked below the Pentarchy.

[[File:Mitra5.jpg|thumb|[[Mitre]] worn by an Eastern bishop with [[icon]]s of Christ, the [[Theotokos]] (Mary, Mother of God) and [[John the Baptist|Forerunner]] (John the Baptist).]]

;[[Catholicos]]:Catholicoi are the heads of some of the [[Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]], [[Oriental Orthodox]], and Eastern Rite Catholic [[sui iuris]] churches (notably the Armenian), roughly similar to a Patriarch (see above).
;[[Primate (religion)|Primate]]:A primate is usually the bishop of the oldest church of a [[nation]]. Sometimes this carries jurisdiction over metropolitan bishops, but usually it is purely honorific. The primate of the [[Scottish Episcopal Church]] is chosen from among the diocesan bishops, and, while retaining diocesan responsibility, is called ''Primus''.
;[[Presiding Bishop]] or President Bishop: These titles are often used for the head of a national Anglican church, but the title is not usually associated with a particular [[episcopal see]] like the title of a primate.
;[[Major archbishop]]:Major archbishops are the heads of some of the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]]. Their authority within their ''sui juris'' church is equal to that of a patriarch, but they receive fewer ceremonial honors.
;[[Metropolitan bishop]]:A [[metropolitan bishop]] is an archbishop in charge of an [[ecclesiastical province]], or group of dioceses, and in addition to having immediate jurisdiction over his own archdiocese, also exercises some oversight over the other dioceses within that province. Sometimes a metropolitan may also be the head of an [[autocephalous]], ''[[sui iuris]]'', or [[autonomous area|autonomous]] church when the number of adherents of that tradition are small. In the Latin Rite, metropolitans are always archbishops; in many Eastern churches, the title is &quot;metropolitan,&quot; with some of these churches using &quot;archbishop&quot; as a separate office.
;[[Archbishop]]:An archbishop is the bishop of an [[archdiocese]]. This is usually a prestigious diocese with an important place in local church history. In the Roman Catholic Church, the title is purely honorific and carries no extra jurisdiction, though most archbishops are also [[metropolitan bishop]]s, as above. In most provinces of the Anglican Communion, however, an archbishop has metropolitical and primatial power.
[[File:Archbishop William Temple.jpg|thumb|[[Archbishop of Canterbury|Archbishop]] [[William Temple (archbishop)|William Temple]].]]
;[[Suffragan bishop]]: A [[suffragan bishop]] is a bishop subordinate to a Metropolitan. In the [[Roman Catholic Church]] this term is applied to all non-metropolitan bishops (that is, diocesan bishops of dioceses within a metropolitan's province, and [[auxiliary bishop]]s). In the [[Anglican Communion]], the term applies to a bishop who is a full-time assistant to a diocesan bishop: the [[Bishop of Warwick]] is suffragan to the [[Bishop of Coventry]] (the diocesan), though both live in [[Coventry]]. Some Anglican suffragans are given the responsibility for a geographical area within the diocese (for example, the Bishop of [[Stepney]] is an ''area bishop'' within the [[Diocese of London]]).
;[[Titular bishop]]:A [[titular bishop]] is a bishop without a diocese. Rather, the bishop is head of a [[titular see]], which is usually an ancient city that used to have a bishop, but, for some reason or other, does not have one now. Titular bishops often serve as [[auxiliary bishop]]s. In the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate]], bishops of modern dioceses are often given a titular see alongside their modern one (for example, the Archbishop of Thyateira and Great Britain).
;[[Auxiliary bishop]]:An [[auxiliary bishop]] is a full-time assistant to a diocesan bishop (the Orthodox and Catholic equivalent of an Anglican [[suffragan bishop]]). An auxiliary bishop is a [[titular bishop]], and he is to be appointed as a [[vicar general]] or at least as an [[episcopal vicar]] of the diocese in which he serves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P1F.HTM | title=Canon 406 | work=Code of Canon Law | year=1983 | accessdate=2009-06-15 | publisher=The [[Holy See]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;
;[[Coadjutor bishop]]:A [[coadjutor bishop]] is an auxiliary bishop who is given almost equal authority in a diocese with the diocesan bishop, and the automatic right to succeed the incumbent diocesan bishop. The appointment of coadjutors is often seen as a means of providing for continuity of church leadership.
;Honorary Assistant bishop, Assisting Bishop, or Bishop Emeritus: These titles are usually applied to retired bishops who are given a general licence to minister as episcopal pastors under a diocesan's oversight. The titles, in this meaning, are not used by the Roman Catholic Church.
;[[Chorbishop]]:A chorbishop is an official of a diocese in some Eastern Christian churches. Chorbishops are not generally ordained bishops – they are not given the sacrament of Holy Orders in that degree – but function as assistants to the diocesan bishop with certain honorary privileges.
;[[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]]:In Roman Catholicism, a [[cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] is a member of the clergy appointed by the pope to serve in the [[College of Cardinals]], the body empowered to elect the pope; however, on turning 80 a cardinal loses this right of election. Cardinals also serve as advisors to the pope and hold positions of authority within the structure of the Catholic Church. Under modern canon law, a man who is appointed a cardinal must accept ordination as a bishop, unless he already is one, or seek special permission from the pope to decline such ordination. Most cardinals are already bishops at the time of their appointment, the majority being archbishops of important archdioceses or patriarchs, and a substantial portion of the rest already titular archbishops serving in the Vatican. Recent popes have appointed a few priests, most of them influential theologians, to the College of Cardinals without requiring them to be ordained as bishops; invariably, these men are over the age of 80, which means they are not permitted to take part in a conclave. The purpose of these appointments is to recognise their tremendous contribution to the life of the Church.

====Duties====
[[File:Confirmation VanderWeyden.png|thumb|left|250px|A bishop administering Confirmation. [[Rogier van der Weyden]], ''The Seven Sacraments'', 15th century.&lt;br /&gt;In the [[Latin Rite]] of the [[Catholic Church]] the administration of [[Confirmation]] is normally reserved to the local bishop.]]

In [[Catholicism]], [[Eastern Orthodoxy]], [[Oriental Orthodoxy]], [[Lutheranism]], and [[Anglicanism]], only a bishop can ordain other bishops, [[priest]]s, and [[deacon]]s.

In the Eastern liturgical tradition, a priest can celebrate the [[Divine Liturgy]] only with the blessing of a bishop. In Byzantine usage, an [[antimins|antimension]] signed by the bishop is kept on the altar partly as a reminder of whose altar it is and under whose [[omophorion]] the priest at a local parish is serving. In Syriac Church usage, a consecrated wooden block called a [[thabilitho]] is kept for the same reasons.

The [[pope]], in addition to being the Bishop of [[diocese of Rome|Rome]] and spiritual head of the [[Catholic Church]], is also the Patriarch of the [[Latin Rite]]. Each bishop within the [[Latin Rite]] is answerable directly to the Pope and not any other bishop except to metropolitans in certain oversight instances. The pope previously used the title ''Patriarch of the West'', but this title was dropped from use in 2006&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/0601225.htm Catholic News Service 2nd March 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; a move which caused some concern within the Orthodox Communion as, to them, it implied wider papal jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/0603382.htm CNS 13 June 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox and Anglican [[cathedral]]s there is a special chair set aside for the exclusive use of the bishop. This is the bishop's ''[[cathedra]]'' and is often called the [[throne]]. In some Christian denominations for example, the Anglican Communion, parish churches may maintain a chair for the use of the bishop when he visits; this is to signify the parish's union with the bishop.

The bishop is also the proper minister of the [[Sacraments of the Catholic Church|sacrament]] of [[confirmation]], and in the Anglican Communion and Liberal Catholic communion only a bishop may administer this sacrament. However, in Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox churches [[chrismation]] is always done at the same time as [[baptism]], and thus the priest is the one who confirms. Within Catholicism, it is invariably the bishop who confirms those being received as adults into the Church. Also, a Catholic bishop may delegate a priest to administer the sacrament in his place; these men are called [[episcopal vicar]]s and are usually responsible for a particular area of the diocese.

====Ordination of Catholic, Orthodox and Anglican bishops====
[[File:Russian Orthodox Episcopal Ordination.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The now-deceased Patriarch Alexius II of Moscow and All Russia consecrating a Russian Orthodox diocesan bishop. Ordination of a bishop, and thus continuation of apostolic succession, takes place through a ritual centred on the [[imposition of hands]] and [[prayer]].]]

Bishops in all of these communions are [[Holy Orders|ordained]] by other bishops through the [[laying on of hands]]. While traditional teaching maintains that any bishop with [[apostolic succession]] can validly perform the ordination of another bishop, some churches require two or three bishops participate, either to ensure sacramental validity or to conform with church law. [[Roman Catholic]] doctrine holds that one bishop can validly ordain another male (priest) as a bishop. Though a minimum of three bishops participating is desirable (there are usually several more) in order to demonstrate collegiality, canonically only one bishop is necessary. The practice of only one bishop ordaining was normal in countries where the Church was persecuted under [[Communist]] rule.

Apart from the ordination, which is always done by other bishops, there are different methods as to the actual selection of a candidate for ordination as bishop. In the [[Catholic Church]] the [[Congregation for Bishops]] oversees the selection of new bishops with the approval of the [[pope]]. The papal nuncio usually solicits names from the bishops of a country, and then selects three to be forwarded to the [[Holy See]]. Most Eastern Orthodox churches allow varying amounts of formalised laity and/or [[lower clergy]] influence on the choice of bishops. This also applies in those Eastern churches which are in union with the pope, though he is required to give assent.

Catholic, Orthodox, Anglican, Liberal Catholic and some Lutheran bishops (for example, Sweden) claim to be part of the continuous sequence of ordained bishops since the days of the apostles referred to as [[apostolic succession]]. Since [[Pope Leo XIII]] issued the bull ''[[Apostolicae Curae]]'' in 1896, the Catholic Church has insisted that Anglican orders are invalid because of changes in the Anglican ordination rites of the 16th century and divergence in understanding of the theology of priesthood, episcopacy and Eucharist. However, since the 1930s, Utrecht Old Catholic bishops (recognised by the Holy See as validily ordained) have sometimes taken part in the ordination of Anglican bishops. According to the writer Timothy Dufort, by 1969, all Church of England bishops had acquired Old Catholic lines of [[apostolic succession]] recognised by the Holy See.&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Dufort, ''The Tablet'', May 29, 1982, pp. 536–538.&lt;/ref&gt; This development has muddied the waters somewhat as it could be argued that the strain of apostolic succession has been re-introduced into Anglicanism, at least within the Church of England.

The Catholic Church does recognise as valid (though illicit) ordinations done by breakaway Catholic, Old Catholic or Oriental bishops, and groups descended from them; it also regards as both valid and licit those ordinations done by bishops of the Eastern churches,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Unitatis Redintegratio]]'' 16: &quot;To remove, then, all shadow of doubt, this holy Council solemnly declares that the Churches of the East, while remembering the necessary unity of the whole Church, have the power to govern themselves according to the disciplines proper to them, since these are better suited to the character of their faithful, and more for the good of their souls.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; so long as those receiving the ordination conform to other canonical requirements (for example, is an adult male) and an orthodox rite of episcopal ordination, expressing the proper functions and sacramental status of a bishop, is used; this has given rise to the phenomenon of ''[[episcopi vagantes]]'' (for example, clergy of the Independent Catholic groups which claim apostolic succession, though this claim is rejected by both Orthodoxy and Catholicism).

The Orthodox Churches would not accept the validity of any ordinations performed by the Independent Catholic groups, as Orthodoxy considers to be spurious any consecration outside of the Church as a whole. Orthodoxy considers [[apostolic succession]] to exist only within the Universal Church, and not through any authority held by individual bishops; thus, if a bishop ordains someone to serve outside of the (Orthodox) Church, the ceremony is ineffectual, and no ordination has taken place regardless of the ritual used or the ordaining prelate's position within the Orthodox Churches.
[[File:Priestly ordination.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The consecrated bishop is the only minister of [[Holy Orders]]. Photo of pre-Vatican II ceremony]]
The position of Roman Catholicism is slightly different. Whilst it does recognise the validity of the orders of certain groups which separated from communion with Holy See. The Holy See accepts as valid the ordinations of the [[Old Catholic]]s in communion with Utrecht, as well as the [[Polish National Catholic Church]] (which received its orders directly from Utrecht, and was—until recently—part of that communion); but Roman Catholicism does not recognise the orders of any group whose teaching is at variance with core tenets of Christianity for example, The [[Liberal Catholic Church]] which has a strong theosophist tendency and permits belief in reincarnation; this is the case even though the clergy of the Independent Catholic groups may use the proper ordination ritual. There are other reasons why the Holy See does not recognise the validity of the orders of the Independent clergy: 

*The continuing practice among many Independent clergy of one person receiving multiple ordinations in order to secure apostolic succession, betrays an incorrect and mechanistic theology of ordination as far as the Holy See is concerned.
*The practice within Independent groups of ordaining women demonstrates an understanding of Priesthood which is totally unacceptable to the Catholic and Orthodox churches as they believe that the Universal Church does not possess such authority; thus, any ceremonies performed by these women are considered to be sacramentally invalid.
*The theology of male clergy within the Independent movement is also suspect according to the Roman Catholics as they presumably approve of the ordination of females, and may have even undergone an (invalid) ordination ceremony conducted by a woman.

[[File:JeffertsSchori.JPG|thumb|170px|[[Katharine Jefferts Schori]], Presiding Bishop of the [[Episcopal Church (United States)]].]]
Whilst members of the [[Independent Catholic]] movement take seriously the issue of valid orders, it is highly significant that the relevant Vatican Congregations tend not to respond to petitions from Independent Catholic bishops and clergy who seek to be received into communion with the Holy See, hoping to continue in some sacramental role. In those instances where the pope does grant reconciliation, those deemed to be clerics within the Independent Old Catholic movement are invariably admitted as laity and not priests or bishops.

There is a mutual recognition of the validity of orders amongst Roman Catholic, [[Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]], [[Old Catholic]], [[Oriental Orthodox]] and [[Assyrian Church of the East|Assyrian Nestorian]] churches.

Some [[Ecclesiastical province|provinces]] of the [[Anglican Communion]] have begun [[ordination of women|ordaining women]] as bishops in recent decades for example, the United States, New Zealand, Canada and Cuba. The first woman bishop within Anglicanism was [[Barbara Clementine Harris]], who was ordained in the United States in 1989. In 2006, [[Katharine Jefferts Schori]], the Episcopal [[Episcopal Diocese of Nevada|Bishop of Nevada]], became the first woman to become the Presiding Bishop of the Episcopal Church.

===Lutheranism===
In the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]] (ELCA) and the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada]] (ELCIC), the largest Lutheran Church bodies in the United States and Canada respectively and roughly based on the [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] Lutheran state churches (similar to that of the [[Church of England]]), bishops are elected by Synod Assemblies, consisting of both lay members and clergy, for a term of 6 years, which can be renewed, depending upon the local synod's &quot;constitution&quot; (which is mirrored on either the ELCA or ELCIC's national constitution). Since the implementation of concordats between the ELCA and the [[Episcopal Church of the United States]] and the ELCIC and the [[Anglican Church of Canada]], all bishops, including the Presiding Bishop (ELCA) or the National Bishop (ELCIC), has been consecrated using the historic succession, with at least one Anglican bishop serving as co-consecrator.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elca.org/ecumenical/fullcommunion/episcopal/ccmresources/text.html] &quot;Called to Common Mission,&quot; 1999. viewed 29 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elca.org/lutheranpartners/archives/histepi.html] Wright, J. Robert, &quot;The Historic Episcopate: An Episcopalian Viewpoint,&quot; Lutheran Partners, March / April 1999—Volume 15, Number 2, viewed 29 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Since going into ecumenical communion with their respective Anglican body, bishops in the ELCA or the ELCIC not only approve the &quot;rostering&quot; of all ordained pastors, diaconal ministers, and associates in ministry, but they serve as the principal celebrant of all pastoral ordination and installation ceremonies, diaconal consecration ceremonies, as well as serving as the &quot;chief pastor&quot; of the local synod, upholding the teachings of [[Martin Luther]] as well as the documentations of the Ninety-Five Theses and the [[Augsburg Confession]]. Unlike their counterparts in the [[United Methodist Church]], ELCA and ELCIC synod bishops do not appoint pastors to local congregations (pastors, like their counterparts in the Episcopal Church, are called by local congregations). The Presiding Bishop of the ELCA and the National Bishop of the ELCIC, the national bishops of their respective bodies, is elected for a single 6-year term and may be elected to an additional term.

Although ELCA agreed with the Episcopal Church to limit ordination to the bishop &quot;ordinarily&quot;, ELCA pastor-''ordinators'' are given permission to perform the rites in &quot;extraordinary&quot; circumstance. In practice, &quot;extraordinary&quot; circumstance have included disagreeing with Episcopalian views of the episcopate, and as a result, ELCA pastors ordained by other pastors are not permitted to be deployed to Episcopal Churches (they can, however, serve in [[Presbyterian Church USA]], [[United Methodist Church]], [[Reformed Church in America]], and [[Moravian Church]] congregations, as the ELCA is in full communion with these denominations). The [[Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod]] (LCMS) and the [[Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod]] (WELS), the second and third largest Lutheran bodies in the United States and the two largest [[Confessional Lutheran]] bodies in North America, do not have a bishop as the head of the church or middle jurisdiction, practicing a form of congregationalism similar to the [[United Church of Christ]]. It should also be noted that the second largest of the three predecessor bodies of the ELCA, the [[American Lutheran Church]], was a congregationalist body, with national and synod presidents before they were re-titled as bishops (borrowing from the Lutheran churches in Germany) in the 1980s.

===Methodism===
====United Methodist Church====
{{further|[[Resident Bishop (United Methodist)]] and [[United Methodist Council of Bishops]]}}
[[File:UMEpiscopalShield.jpg|thumb|right|United Methodist Episcopal Shield]]

In the [[United Methodist Church]] (the largest branch of Methodism in the United States) bishops serve as administrative and pastoral superintendents of the church. They are elected for life from among the [[Elder (Methodism)|ordained elders]] (presbyters) by vote of the delegates in regional (called jurisdictional) conferences, and are consecrated by the other bishops present at the conference through the laying on of hands. In the United Methodist Church bishops remain members of the &quot;[[Elder (Methodism)|Order of Elders]]&quot; while being consecrated to the &quot;[[Episcopal polity|Office of the Episcopacy]]&quot;. Within the United Methodist Church only bishops are empowered to consecrate bishops and ordain clergy. Among their most critical duties is the ordination and appointment of clergy to serve local churches as pastor, presiding at sessions of the Annual, Jurisdictional, and General Conferences, providing pastoral ministry for the clergy under their charge, and safeguarding the doctrine and discipline of the Church. Furthermore, individual bishops, or the Council of Bishops as a whole, often serve a prophetic role, making statements on important social issues and setting forth a vision for the denomination, though they have no legislative authority of their own. In all of these areas, bishops of the United Methodist Church function very much in the historic meaning of the term. According to the ''[[Book of Discipline of the United Methodist Church]]'', a bishop's responsibilities are {{quote|
''Leadership.—Spiritual and Temporal''—
# To lead and oversee the spiritual and temporal affairs of The United Methodist Church, which confesses Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior, and particularly to lead the Church in its mission of witness and service in the world.
# To travel through the connection at large as the Council of Bishops (¶ 526) to implement stategy for the concern of the Church.
# To provide liaison and leadership in the quest for Christian unity in ministry, mission, and structure and in the search for strengthened relationships with other living faith communities.
# To organize such Missions as shall have been authorized by the [[General conference (United Methodist Church)|General Conference]].
# To promote and support the evangelistic vision of the whole Church.
# To discharge such other duties as the Discipline may direct.

''Presidential Duties.''—1. To preside in the General, Jurisdictional, Central, and Annual Conferences. 2. To form the districts after consultation with the district superintendents and after the number of the same has been determined by vote of the Annual Conference. 3. To appoint the [[District Superintendent (United Methodist Church)|district superintendents]] annually (¶¶ 517–518). 4. To consecrate bishops, to ordain elders and deacons, to consecrate diaconal ministers, to commission [[deaconess]]es and home missionaries, and to see that the names of the persons commissioned and consecrated are entered on the journals of the conference and that proper credentials are funised to these persons.

''Working with Ministers.''—1. To make and fix the appointments in the Annual Conferences, Provisional Annual Conferences, and Missions as the Discipline may direct (¶¶ 529–533).
2. To divide or to unite a circuit(s), stations(s), or mission(s) as judged necessary for missionary strategy and then to make appropriate appointments. 3. To read the appointments of deaconesses, diaconal ministers, lay persons in service under the World Division of the General Board of Global Ministries, and home missionaries. 4. To fix the Charge Conference membership of all ordained ministers appointed to ministries other than the local church in keeping with ¶443.3. 5. To transfer, upon the request of the receiving bishop, minsterial member(s) of one Annual Conference to another, ''provided'' said member(s) agrees to transfer; and to send immediately to the secretaries of both conferences involved , to the conference Boards of Ordained Ministry, and to the clearing house of the General Board of Pensions written notices of the transfer of members and of their standing in the course of study if they are undergraduates.&lt;ref name=&quot;Discipline 1&quot;&gt;''The Book of Discipline of the United Methodist Church: Specific Responsibilities of Bishops—¶ 514–516'' (retrieved 27 May 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In each Annual Conference, United Methodist bishops serve for four year terms, and may serve up to three terms before either retirement or appointment to a new Conference. United Methodist bishops may be male or female, with the Rev. [[Marjorie Matthews]] being the first woman to be consecrated a bishop in 1980.

The collegial expression of episcopal leadership in the [[United Methodist Church]] is known as the [[United Methodist Council of Bishops|Council of Bishops]]. The Council of Bishops speaks to the Church and through the Church into the world and gives leadership in the quest for Christian unity and interreligious relationships.&lt;ref name=&quot;Discipline 2&quot;&gt;''The Book of Discipline of the United Methodist Church: Council of Bishops—¶ 526'' (retrieved 27 May 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Conference of Methodist Bishops'' includes the United Methodist ''Council of Bishops'' plus bishops from affiliated autonomous [[Methodist]] or [[United and uniting churches|United]] Churches.

[[File:AsburyOrdination.jpg|thumb|left|[[Francis Asbury|Asbury]]'s consecration as bishop in 1784.]]
[[John Wesley]] consecrated [[Thomas Coke (bishop)|Thomas Coke]] a &quot;General Superintendent,&quot; and directed that [[Francis Asbury]] also be consecrated for the [[United States|United States of America]] in 1784, where the [[Methodist Episcopal Church]] first became a separate [[religious denomination|denomination]] apart from the [[Church of England]]. Coke soon returned to England, but Asbury was the primary builder of the new church. At first he did not call himself bishop, but eventually submitted to the usage by the denomination.

Notable bishops in United Methodist history include [[Thomas Coke (bishop)|Coke]], [[Francis Asbury|Asbury]], [[Richard Whatcoat]], [[Philip William Otterbein]], [[Martin Boehm]], [[Jacob Albright]], [[John Seybert]], [[Matthew Simpson]], [[John S. Stamm]], [[William Ragsdale Cannon]], [[Marjorie Matthews]], [[Leontine T. Kelly]] , [[William B. Oden]], [[Ntambo Nkulu Ntanda]], [[Joseph Sprague]], [[William Henry Willimon]], and [[Thomas Bickerton]].

Methodists in the [[United Kingdom]] acquired their own bishops early in the 19th century, after the Methodist movement in Britain formally parted company with the Church of England. The position no longer exists in British Methodism.

====Christian Methodist Episcopal Church====
In the [[Christian Methodist Episcopal Church]] in the United States, bishops are administrative superintendents of the church; they are elected by &quot;delegate&quot; votes for as many years deemed until the age of 74, then he/she must retire. Among their duties, are responsibility for appointing clergy to serve local churches as pastor, for performing ordinations, and for safeguarding the doctrine and discipline of the Church. The General Conference, a meeting every four years, has an equal number of clergy and lay delegates. In each Annual Conference, CME bishops serve for four year terms. CME Church bishops may be male or female.

===The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints===
{{Main|Bishop (Latter Day Saints)}}

In [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], the [[Bishop (Latter Day Saints)|Bishop]] is the leader of a local congregation, called a [[ward (LDS Church)|ward]]. As with most Mormon priesthood, the bishop is a part-time lay minister and earns a living through other employment; in all cases, he is a married man. As such, it is his duty to preside at services, call local leaders, and judge the worthiness of members for service. The bishop does not deliver sermons at every service (generally asking members to do so), but is expected to be a spiritual guide for his congregation. It is therefore believed that he has both the right and ability to receive divine inspiration (through the [[Holy Spirit]]) for the [[ward (LDS Church)|ward]] under his direction. Because it is a part-time position, all able members are expected to assist in the management of the ward by holding delegated lay positions (for example, women's and youth leaders, teachers) referred to as 'callings.' Although members are asked to confess serious sins to him, unlike the [[Roman Catholic Church]], he is not the instrument of divine forgiveness, merely a guide through the repentance process (and a judge in case transgressions warrant excommunication or other official discipline). The bishop is also responsible for the physical welfare of the ward, and thus collects [[Tithe|tithing]] and [[fast offering]]s and distributes financial assistance where needed.

A bishop is the president of the [[Aaronic priesthood]] in his ward (and is thus a form of Mormon [[Kohen]]; in fact, the church's [[Doctrine and Covenants]] states that any &quot;descendant of Aaron&quot; who converts to Mormonism has no need to be ordained to the office of bishop as they descend from that lineage directly). A bishop is also a [[High priest (Latter Day Saints)|High priest]] in the [[Melchizedek priesthood]]. Each bishop is selected from resident members of the ward by the [[stake (Latter Day Saints)|stake presidency]] with approval of the [[First Presidency]], and chooses two ''counselors'' to form a ''bishopric''. In special circumstances (such as a ward consisting entirely of young university students), a bishop may be chosen from outside the ward. A bishop is typically released after about five years and a new bishop is called to the position. Although the former bishop is released from his duties, he continues to hold the Aaronic priesthood office of Bishop.  Church members frequently refer to a former bishop as &quot;Bishop&quot; as a sign of respect and love.

Latter Day Saint bishops do not wear any special clothing or insignia the way clergy in many other churches do, but are expected to dress and groom themselves neatly and conservatively per their local culture, especially when performing official duties. Bishops (as well as other members of the priesthood) can trace their line of authority back to [[Joseph Smith, Jr.]], who, according to church doctrine, was ordained to lead the Church in modern times by the ancient [[Twelve Apostles|apostles]] [[Saint Peter|Peter]], [[James, son of Zebedee|James]], and [[John the Apostle|John]], who were ordained to lead the Church by Jesus Christ.

The [[Presiding Bishop (LDS Church)|Presiding Bishop]] oversees the temporal affairs (buildings, properties, commercial corporations, and so on) of the worldwide Church, including the Church's massive global humanitarian aid and social welfare programs. The Presiding Bishop has two counselors; the three together form the Presiding Bishopric.

===New Apostolic Church===
The [[New Apostolic Church]] (NAC) knows three classes of ministries: Deacons, Priests and Apostles. The [[New Apostolic Church#Ministries|Apostles]], who are all included in the apostolate with the [[Chief Apostle]] as head, are the highest ministries.

Of the several kinds of priest....ministries, the bishop is the highest. Nearly all bishops are set in line directly from the chief apostle. They support and help their superior apostle.

===Church of God (Cleveland, Tennessee)===
In the polity of the [[Church of God (Cleveland, Tennessee)]], the international leader is the Presiding Bishop, and the members of the Executive Committee are Executive Bishops. Collectively, they supervise and appoint national and state leaders across the world. Leaders of individual states and regions are Administrative Bishops, who have jurisdiction over local churches in their respective states and are vested with appointment authority for local pastorates. All ministers are credentialed at one of three levels of licensure, the most senior of which is the rank of Ordained Bishop. To be eligible to serve in state, national, or international positions of authority, a minister must hold the rank of Ordained Bishop.

===Pentecostal Church of God===
In 2002, the general convention of the [[Pentecostal Church of God]] came to a consensus to change the title of their overseer from General Superintendent to Bishop. The change was brought on because internationally, the term Bishop is more commonly related to religious leaders than the previous title.

The title Bishop is used for both the General (International leader) and the district (state) leaders. The title is sometimes used in conjunction with the previous thus becoming General (District) Superintendent/Bishop.

===Others===
Some Baptists have begun taking on the title of Bishop.[http://atheism.about.com/b/2003/10/04/baptist-bishops-bucking-tradition.htm]

In some smaller Protestant denominations and independent churches the term bishop is used in the same way as pastor, to refer to the leader of the local congregation, and may be male or female. This usage is especially common in African American churches in the USA. In the [[Church of Scotland]], which has a Presbyterian church structure, the word &quot;bishop&quot; refers to an ordained person, usually a normal parish minister, who has temporary oversight of a trainee minister. In the [[Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.)]], the term bishop is an expressive name for a Minister of Word and Sacrament who serves a congregation and exercises &quot;the oversight of the flock of Christ.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.). Book of Order (2009-2011) (Louisville: Office of the General Assembly), G-6.0202.&lt;/ref&gt; The term is traceable to the 1789 Form of Government of the PC(U.S.A.) and the Presbyterian understanding of the pastoral office.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oga.pcusa.org/ecumenicalrelations/images/peter.pdf See &quot;The Successor To Peter&quot;, a discussion paper from the 2000 Presbyterian and Roman Catholic dialog.]&lt;/ref&gt;

While not considered orthodox Christian, the [[Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica]] uses roles and titles derived from Christianity for its clerical hierarchy, including bishops who have much the same authority and responsibilities as in Roman Catholicism.

The Salvation Army does not have bishops but have appointed leaders of geographical areas known as Divisional Commanders. Larger geographical areas, called Territories, are led by a Territorial Commander, who is the highest ranking officer in that Territory.

==Dress and insignia==

{{Main|Pontifical vestments}}

Traditionally, a number of items are associated with the office of a bishop, most notably the [[mitre]], [[crosier]], and [[ecclesiastical ring]]. Other vestments and insignia vary between Eastern and Western Christianity.

In the Latin Rite of the [[Catholic Church]], the [[choir dress]] of a bishop includes the purple [[cassock]] with amaranth trim, [[rochet]], purple [[zucchetto]] (skull cap), purple [[biretta]], and [[pectoral cross]]. The [[cappa magna]] may be worn, but only within the bishop's own diocese and on especially solemn occasions.&lt;ref&gt;''Caeremoniale Episcoporum'', 64&lt;/ref&gt; The [[mitre]], [[zuchetto]], and [[Stole (vestment)|stole]] are generally worn by bishops when presiding over liturgical functions. For liturgical functions other than the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] the bishop typically wears the [[cope]]. Within his own [[diocese]] and when celebrating solemnly elsewhere with the consent of the local [[ordinary]], he also uses the [[crosier]].&lt;ref&gt;''Caeremoniale Episcoporum'', 59&lt;/ref&gt; When celebrating [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]], a bishop, like a [[Priest (Catholic Church)|priest]], wears the [[chasuble]]. The [[Caeremoniale Episcoporum]] recommends, but does not impose, that in solemn celebrations a bishop should also wear a [[dalmatic]], which can always be white, beneath the chasuble, especially when administering the sacrament of [[holy orders]], blessing an abbot or abbess, and dedicating a church or an altar.&lt;ref&gt;''Caeremoniale Episcoporum'', 56&lt;/ref&gt; The Caeremoniale Episcoporum no longer makes mention of [[episcopal gloves]], [[episcopal sandals]], [[liturgical stockings]] (also known as [[buskins]]), or the accoutrements that it once prescribed for the bishop's horse. The coat of arms of a Latin Rite Catholic bishop usually displays a [[galero]] with a cross and crosier behind the [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]]; the specifics differ by location and ecclesiastical rank (see [[Ecclesiastical heraldry]]).

[[Anglican]] bishops generally make use of the [[mitre]], [[crosier]], [[ecclesiastical ring]], purple [[cassock]], purple [[zucchetto]], and [[pectoral cross]]. However, the traditional [[choir dress]] of Anglican bishops is quite different from that of their Catholic counterparts; it consists of a long [[rochet]] which is worn with a [[chimere]].

In the [[Eastern Churches]] ([[Eastern Orthodox]], [[Eastern Rite Catholic]]) a bishop will wear the [[mandyas]], [[panagia]] (and perhaps an [[enkolpion]]), [[sakkos]], [[omophorion]] and an Eastern-style [[mitre]]. Eastern bishops do not normally wear an episcopal ring; the faithful kiss the bishop's hand. To seal official documents, he will usually use an inked stamp. An Eastern bishop's coat of arms will normally display an Eastern-style mitre, cross, eastern style crosier and a red and white (or red and gold) [[Ecclesiastical_heraldry#Mantle|mantle]]. The arms of [[Oriental Orthodox]] bishops will display the episcopal insignia (mitre or turban) specific to their own liturgical traditions. Variations occur based upon jurisdiction and national customs.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Bertrand Andrieu''' (November 4, 1761 &amp;ndash; December 10, 1822) was a  French engraver of medals from [[Bordeaux]].  In [[France]] he was considered as the restorer of the art, which had declined after the time of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], and during the last twenty years of his life the French government commissiond him to undertake several works.  Many of his medals are figured in the ''Medallic History of [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]]''.
