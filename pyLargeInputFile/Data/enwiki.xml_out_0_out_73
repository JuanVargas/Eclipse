onciliation Committee&quot; composed of the Council members plus an equal number of MEPs. If a Committee manages to adopt a joint text, it still has to be approved by both the Council and Parliament or the proposal is abandoned.&lt;ref name=&quot;Parliament's powers&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Codecision procedure|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|European Parliament]]|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/parliament/public/staticDisplay.do?id=46&amp;pageRank=4&amp;language=EN|accessdate = 2007-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The few other areas that operate the ''special legislative procedures'' are justice &amp; home affairs, budget and taxation and certain aspects of other policy areas: such as the fiscal aspects of environmental policy. In these areas, the Council or Parliament decide law alone.&lt;ref name=&quot;lisbon explain&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;decision making&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Decision-making in the European Union|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|date=|url=http://www.europa.eu/institutions/decision-making/index_en.htm|doi=|accessdate=2007-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The procedure used also depends upon which type of [[European Union law#Legislation|institutional act]] is being used. The strongest act is a [[Regulation (European Union)|regulation]], an [[Act of Parliament|act]] or [[Statutory law|law]] which is directly applicable in its entirety. Then there are [[Directive (European Union)|directives]] which bind members to certain goals which they must achieve. They do this through their own laws and hence have room to manoeuvre in deciding upon them. A [[European Union decision|decision]] is an instrument which is focused at a particular person or group and is directly applicable. Institutions may also issue [[European Union recommendation|recommendations and opinions]] which are merely non-binding declarations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Community legal instruments|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|date=|url=http://europa.eu/scadplus/glossary/community_legal_instruments_en.htm|doi=|accessdate=2007-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Council votes in one of three ways; [[unanimity]], [[Majority|simple majority]], or [[qualified majority]]. In most cases, the Council votes on issues by [[Voting in the Council of the European Union|qualified majority voting]], meaning that there must be a minimum of 255 votes out of 345 (73.9 %) and a majority of member states (sometimes a two–third majority). A majority representing 62% of the EU's population may also be taken into account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher = [[Europa (web portal)]]|title = The decision making triangle|url=http://europa.eu/abc/12lessons/lesson_4/index_en.htm|accessdate = 2007-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unanimity is nearly always used where foreign policy is concerned, and in a number of cases under police and judicial co-operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher = 2005 UK Presidency website|title = Council of the European Union |url=http://www.eu2005.gov.uk/servlet/Front?pagename=OpenMarket/Xcelerate/ShowPage&amp;c=Page&amp;cid=1109176488805|accessdate = 2007-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Foreign affairs ===
The legal instruments used by the Council for the [[Common Foreign and Security Policy]] are different from the legislative acts. Under the CFSP they consist of &quot;common positions&quot;, &quot;joint actions&quot;, and &quot;common strategies&quot;. Common positions relate to defining a European foreign policy towards a particular third-country such as the promotion of human rights and democracy in [[Burma]], a region such as the stabilisation efforts in the [[African Great Lakes]], or a certain issue such as support for the [[International Criminal Court]]. A common position, once agreed, is binding on all EU states who must follow and defend the policy, which is regularly revised. A joint action refers to a co-ordinated action of the states to deploy resources in order to achieve an objective, for example for mine clearing or to combat the spread of [[small arms]]. Common strategies defined an objective and commits the EUs resources to that task for four years.&lt;ref name=&quot;FR instru&quot;&gt;{{cite web|publisher = [[French Foreign Ministry]]|title=Joint actions, common positions and common strategies|url=http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/european-union_157/eu-in-the-world_1491/common-foreign-and-security-policy_5463/operation-of-the-cfsp_5467/cfsp-decision-making-processes-and-instruments_5473/joint-actions-common-positions-and-common-strategies_8752.html|accessdate = 2007-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Budgetary authority ===
Furthermore, the legislative branch officially holds the Union's budgetary authority. The [[Budget of the European Union|EU's budget]] (which is around 116.4 billion [[euro]]&lt;ref name=&quot;budget glance&quot;&gt;{{cite web|publisher = [[Europa (web portal)]]|title = Where fors the money come from?|url=http://ec.europa.eu/budget/budget_glance/where_from_en.htm|accessdate = 2007-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is subject to a form of the ordinary legislative procedure with a single reading giving Parliament power over the entire budget (prior to 2009, its influence was limited to certain areas) on an equal footing to the Council. If there is a disagreement between them, it is taken to a conciliation committee as it is for legislative proposals. But if the joint conciliation text is not approved, the Parliament may adopt it budget definitively.&lt;ref name=&quot;lisbon explain&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title = Explaining the Treaty of Lisbon|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|Europa website]]|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=MEMO/09/531|accessdate = 2009-12-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the budget, the Council coordinates the economic policy of members.&lt;ref name=&quot;Consilium - Council&quot;/&gt;

== Organisation ==
=== Presidency ===
{{Main|Presidency of the Council of the European Union}}
The Presidency of the Council is not a single post, but is held by a member state's government (Hungary for the first half of 2011).{{update after|2011|06|01|reason=Change here every 6 months, not just in Infobox. Poland will hold the position starting in July}} Every six months the presidency rotates between the states, in an order predefined by the Council's members, allowing each state to preside over the body. From 2007, every three-member states cooperate for their combined eighteen months on a common agenda, although only one formally holds the presidency for the normal six-month period. For example the President for the second half of 2007, Portugal, was the second in a trio of states alongside Germany and [[Slovenia]] with whom Portugal had been co-operating. The Council meets in various configurations (as outlined below) so its membership changes depending upon the issue. The person chairing the Council will always be the member from the state holding the Presidency. A delegate from the following Presidency also assists the presiding member and may take over work if requested.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pres DE&quot;&gt;{{cite web|publisher = 2007 German Presidency website|title = What is the Presidency?|url=http://www.eu2007.de/en/The_Council_Presidency/What_is_the_Presidency/index.html|accessdate = 2007-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pres PT&quot;&gt;{{cite web|publisher = 2007 Portuguese Presidency website|title = The Presidency|url=http://www.eu2007.pt/UE/vEN/Presidencia_Conselho/A_Presidencia/default_.htm|accessdate = 2007-10-14|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071020220019/http://www.eu2007.pt/UE/vEN/Presidencia_Conselho/A_Presidencia/default_.htm |archivedate = October 20, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exception however is the foreign affairs council, which has been chaired by the [[High Representative]] since the entry into force of the [[Lisbon Treaty]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Const Info&quot;/&gt;

The role of the Presidency is administrative and political. On the administrative side it is responsible for procedures and organising the work of the Council during its term. This includes summoning the Council for meetings along with directing the work of COREPER and other committees and working groups. The political element is the role of successfully dealing with issues and mediating in the Council. In particular this includes setting the agenda of the council, hence giving the Presidency substantial influence in the work of the Council during its term. The Presidency also plays a major role in representing the Council within the EU and representing the EU internationally, for example at the [[United Nations]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Pres PT&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pres FI&quot;&gt;{{cite web|publisher = 2007 Finnish Presidency website|title = The presidency in general|url=http://www.eu2006.fi/the_presidency/en_GB/the_presidency_in_general/|accessdate = 2007-10-14|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061003140815/http://www.eu2006.fi/the_presidency/en_GB/the_presidency_in_general/ |archivedate = October 3, 2006|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher = [[Europa (web portal)]]|title = Council Decision of 15 September 2006 adopting the Council's Rules of Procedure |url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2006:285:0047:0048:EN:PDF|format=PDF|accessdate = 2007-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Configurations ===
Legally speaking, the Council is a single entity, but it is in practice divided into several different council configurations (or ‘(con)formations’). Article 16(6) of the [[Treaty on European Union]] provides:
{{quote|The Council shall meet in different configurations, the list of which shall be adopted in accordance with Article 236 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.

The General Affairs Council shall ensure consistency in the work of the different Council configurations. It shall prepare and ensure the follow-up to meetings of the European Council, in liaison with the President of the European Council and the Commission.

The Foreign Affairs Council shall elaborate the Union's external action on the basis of strategic guidelines laid down by the European Council and ensure that the Union's action is consistent.}}

Each council configuration deals with a different functional area, for example agriculture and fisheries. In this formation, the council is composed of ministers from each state government who are responsible for this area: the agriculture and fisheries ministers. The [[Chair (official)|chair]] of this council is held by the member from the state holding the presidency (see section above). Similarly, the Economic and Financial Affairs Council is composed of national finance ministers, and they are still one per state and the chair is held by the member coming from the presiding country. The Councils meet irregularly throughout the year except for the three major configurations (top three below) which meet once a month. There are currently ten formations:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|Council of the European Union]]|title = Council configurations|url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/cms3_fo/showPage.asp?id=427&amp;lang=en&amp;mode=g|accessdate = 2007-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Council Booklet&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Information handbook of the Council of the European Union|publisher=Office of Official Publications of the European Communities|year=2007|location =Brussels|pages=|url=|doi=|id=|isbn=978-92-824-2203-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[General Affairs Council|General Affairs]] (Genaff):''' General affairs co-ordinates the work of the Council, prepares for [[European Council]] meetings and deals with issues crossing various council formations.
* '''[[Foreign Affairs Council|Foreign Affairs]] (Foraff):''' Chaired by the [[High Representative]], rather than the Presidency, it manages the [[Common Foreign and Security Policy|CFSP]], [[Common Security and Defence Policy|CSDP]] and development cooperation. It sometimes meets in a '''defence configuration'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eu2008.fr/impression8f11.html?url=%2FPFUE%2Flang%2Fen%2Faccueil%2FPFUE-10_2008%2FPFUE-31.10.2008%2Fpid%2F17038 Report from the conference on crisis management, French presidency, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:EU Council Room.jpg|thumb|The main meeting room of the Council]]
* '''[[Economic and Financial Affairs Council|Economic and Financial Affairs]] (Ecofin):''' Composed of economics and finance ministers of the member states. It includes [[EU budget|budgetary]] and [[eurozone]] matters via an informal group composed only of eurozone member ministers.&lt;ref name=&quot;CER Treaty&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=|title=The CER guide to the EU’s constitutional treaty|publisher=[[Centre for European Reform]]|month=July | year=2004|url=http://www.cer.org.uk/pdf/policybrief_constitution_july04.pdf|accessdate = 2007-06-24|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Agriculture and Fisheries''': One of the oldest configurations, this brings together once a month the ministers for agriculture and fisheries, and the commissioners responsible for agriculture, fisheries, food safety, veterinary questions and public health matters.
* '''Justice and Home Affairs Council (JHA):''' This configuration brings together Justice ministers and Interior Ministers of the Member States. Includes civil protection.
* '''Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council (EPSCO):''' Composed of employment, social protection, consumer protection, health and equal opportunities ministers.
* '''Competitiveness:''' Created in June 2002 through the merging of three previous configurations (Internal Market, Industry and Research). Depending on the items on the agenda, this formation is composed of ministers responsible for areas such as European affairs, industry, tourism and scientific research. With the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, the EU acquired competence in space matters,&lt;ref&gt;Art.4 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU.http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2010:083:0047:0200:EN:PDF&lt;/ref&gt; and space policy has been attributed to the Competitiveness Council&lt;ref&gt;http://consilium.europa.eu/showpage.aspx?id=412&amp;lang=en&lt;/ref&gt; 
* '''Transport, Telecommunications and Energy:''' Created in June 2002, through the merging of three policies under one configuration, and with a composition varying according to the specific items on its agenda. This formation meets approximately once every two months.
* '''Environment:''' Composed of environment ministers, who meet about four times a year.
* '''Education, Youth, Culture and Sport:''' Composed of education, culture, youth, communications and sport ministers, who meet around three or four times a year.&lt;ref&gt;http://consilium.europa.eu/showpage.aspx?id=416&amp;lang=en&lt;/ref&gt; Includes audiovisual issues.

Complementing these, the Political and Security Committee (PSC) brings together ambassadors to monitor international situations and define policies within the CSDP, particularly in crises.&lt;ref name=&quot;Council Booklet&quot;/&gt; The [[European Council]] is similar to a configuration of the Council, it operates in a similar way and but is composed of the national leaders ([[head of government|heads of government]] [[head of state|or state]]) and has its own President,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.european-council.europa.eu/the-institution.aspx?lang=EN&lt;/ref&gt; currently [[Herman Van Rompuy]]. The body's purpose is to define the general &quot;impetus&quot; of the Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|Council of the European Union]]|title = European Council|url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/cms3_fo/showPage.asp?id=429&amp;lang=en|accessdate = 2007-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The European Council deals with the major issues such as the appointment of the [[President of the European Commission]] who takes part in the body's meetings.&lt;ref name=&quot;CP app&quot;/&gt;

[[Economic and Financial Affairs Council|Ecofin]]'s Eurozone component, the [[Euro group]], is also a formal group with its own President.&lt;ref name=&quot;CER Treaty&quot;/&gt;

Following the entry into force of a framework agreement between the EU and [[European Space Agency|ESA]] there is a '''Space Council''' configuration - joint and concomitant meeting of the EU Council and of the ESA Council at ministerial level dealing with the implementation of the [[European Space Policy|ESP]] adopted by both organizations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esa.int/esaCP/Pr_21_2007_p_EN.html ESA PR: N° 21-2007:  Europe’s Space Policy becomes a reality today]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.consilium.europa.eu/App/accords/Default.aspx?command=details&amp;id=297&amp;lang=EN&amp;aid=2003099&amp;doclang=EN Framework Agreement between the European Community and the European Space Agency]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Civil Service ===
{{See|European Civil Service}}
The [[General Secretariat of the Council of the European Union|General Secretariat of the Council]] provides the continuous infrastructure of the council, carrying out preparation for meetings, draft reports, translation, records, documents, agendas and assisting the presidency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|Council of the European Union]]|title = FAQ: General Secretariat of the Council|url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/cms3_fo/faqHomePage.Asp?command=details&amp;node=19&amp;lang=en&amp;cmsId=1|accessdate = 2007-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Secretary-General of the Council of the European Union|Secretary General of the Council]] is head of the General Secretariat, currently [[Pierre de Boissieu]]. The post is a powerful position within the Union and its holder a notable figure; {{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} previously he was also the [[High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|Council of the European Union]]|title = Javier Solana|url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/cms3_applications/applications/solana/index.asp?lang=EN&amp;cmsid=246|accessdate = 2007-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; President of the [[European Defence Agency]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|European Defence Agency]]|title = European Defence Agency|url=http://www.eda.europa.eu/|accessdate = 2007-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Western European Union]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher = Western European Union|title = Western European Union|url=http://www.weu.int/index.html|accessdate = 2007-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

The [[Committee of Permanent Representatives]] (COREPER) is a body composed of representatives from the states (ambassadors, civil servants etc.) who meet each week to prepare the work and tasks of the Council. It monitors and co-ordinates work and deals with the Parliament on co-decision legislation (along with leading the non–EU defence organisation, the [[Western European Union]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher = [[Europa (web portal)]]|title = Glossary|url=http://ec.europa.eu/codecision/stepbystep/glossary_en.htm|accessdate = 2007-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is divided into two groups of the representatives (Coreper II) and their deputies (Coreper I). Agriculture is dealt with separately by the Special Committee on Agriculture (SCA). The numerous working groups submit their reports to the Council through Coreper or SCA.&lt;ref name=&quot;Council Booklet&quot;/&gt;

=== Voting system ===
{{See|Voting in the Council of the European Union}}
The Council is composed of national ministers for the relevant topic of discussion, with each minister representing their national government. The currently effective [[qualified majority voting]] rules are defined in the [[Treaty of Nice]].&lt;ref name=NiceTreaty&gt;{{cite web | title = Treaty of Nice | work = Amending the Treaty on the European Union, the Treaties establishing the European Communities and certain Related Acts | publisher = Official Journal of the European Communities | date = 10 March 2001 | url = http://eur-lex.europa.eu/en/treaties/dat/12001C/pdf/12001C_EN.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, for a proposal to pass, the supporting side needs to surpass three criteria:
# 50% (if proposal was made by the [[European Commission|Commission]]) or 67% (all other cases) of the members states,
# 74% of the voting weights,
# 62% of the EU population (this criterion is only checked upon request by a Council member).
The following table is ranked for the power the member states exert on Council decisions, and lists their population figures (criterion three) and voting weights (criterion two) along with their ruling parties and affiliations to European parties.&lt;ref name=&quot;Consilium - Council&quot;/&gt;

Under special legislative procedures there is little influence from Parliament or the Commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |  title =Police and Judicial Co-operation in Criminal Matters: Will the EU Constitutional Treaty Keep it Together | publisher = EurActiv.com | year = 2004 | url =http://www.euractiv.com/en/justice/police-judicial-operation-criminal-matters-eu-constitutional-treaty-keep/article-117047| accessdate = 2007-06-24 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071019004953/http://www.euractiv.com/en/justice/police-judicial-operation-criminal-matters-eu-constitutional-treaty-keep/article-117047 |archivedate = October 19, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the Council is very powerful and when decisions are taken by qualified majority voting, the voting weights become decisive. This led to the creation of the G5, which has been expanded by Poland to the [[G6 (EU)|G6]] in 2006. The G6 represent the six largest member states with a combined 49.3% of the total voting weight in the council. Therefore, the G6 comprise a lot of power in the Council, which leads to criticisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Select Committee on European Union|title = Behind Closed Doors: the meeting of the G6 Interior Ministers at Heiligendamm (Fortieth Report)| publisher = [[United Kingdom Parliament]] | year = 2004 |url=http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldselect/ldeucom/221/22104.htm#a2|accessdate = 2007-06-24|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070519191750/http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldselect/ldeucom/221/22104.htm#a2 |archivedate = May 19, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher = workpermit.com | title = EU G6 nations agree to fight terrorism and illegal immigration | year = 2006 | url =http://www.workpermit.com/news/2006_10_27/eu/eu_g6_immigration-terrorism_agreement.htm| accessdate = 2007-06-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they cannot pass legislation without the support of other countries.

The [[Treaty of Lisbon]] mandates a change in voting system from 1 November 2014 for most cases to double majority [[Qualified Majority Voting]], replacing the voting weights system. Decisions made by the council have to be taken by 55% of member states representing at least 65% of the EU's population.&lt;ref name=&quot;Const Info&quot;/&gt;

Almost all members of the Council are members of a political party at national level, and most of these are members of a [[European political party|European-level political party]]. However the Council is composed in order to represent the EU's states rather than political parties&lt;ref name=&quot;Consilium - Council&quot;/&gt; and the nature of coalition governments in a number of states means that individual configurations would vary on which domestic party was assigned the portfolio. However the broad ideological alignment of each state does have a bearing on the nature of the law the Council produces and the extent to which the link between domestic parties puts pressure on the members in the European Parliament to vote a certain way.

== Comparisons ==
{{See|Institutions of the European Union#Comparisons}}
[[File:Bundesrat Chamber.jpg|thumb|The Council and the German Bundesrat, are both composed by representatives of the states governments]]
Although common in executive intergovernmental systems, as a legislature the Council has few institutions of comparison. The composition of the council can only be compared with the quite unique and unusual composition of the German upper house, the [[Bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]]. Membership of the Bundesrat is limited to members of the governments of the [[states of Germany]] and can be recalled by those governments in the same manner as the EU's Council. They retain their state role while sitting in the Bundesrat and if their term ends when they are recalled by their state governments (who are solely responsible for their appointment) or they cease to sit in their state government. Elections are not coordinated among states, so government can come and go at any time, and the assembly can not be dissolved. Those members vote in their state blocks and can not cast fractioned votes, hence they do not act as individual members but as representatives of their state governments to that government's agreed line.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bundesrat Memb&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title = Organisation: Bundesrat members|publisher=Bundesrat|url=http://www.bundesrat.de/nn_11006/EN/organisation-en/mitglieder-en/mitglieder-en-inhalt.html?__nnn=true|accessdate = 2008-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The states have unequal voting powers, and decisions are taken by an absolute majority. Likewise, the presidency rotates equally between members, though each year rather than every six months like in the EU Council.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bundesrat Pres&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title = Organisation: The Presidency|publisher=Bundesrat|url=http://www.bundesrat.de/cln_099/nn_11400/EN/organisation-en/praesident-en/praesident-en-node.html?__nnn=true|accessdate = 2008-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, unlike the EU's Council, the Bundesrat does not vary its composition depending on the topic being discussed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bundesrat Memb&quot;/&gt;

== Seat ==
{{See|Location of European Union institutions|Justus Lipsius building}}

By a decision of the European Council at Edinburgh in December 1992, the Council has its seat in Brussels but in April, June, and October, it holds its meetings in Luxembourg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = European Council|title = European Council in Edinburgh: 11–12 December 1992, Annex 6 to Part A| date=1992-12-12|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|European Parliament]]|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/summits/edinburgh/a6_en.pdf|accessdate = 2007-06-24|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1952 and 1967 the ECSC Council held its Luxembourg meetings in the Cercle Municipal on Place d’Armes. Its secretariat moved on numerous occasions but between 1955 and 1967 it was housed in the Verlorenkost district of the city. In 1957 with the creation of two new Communities with their own Councils, discretion on location was given to the current President. In practice this was to be in the [[Castle of the Valley of the Duchess]] until the autumn of 1958, at which point it moved to 2 Rue Ravensteinstraat in Brussels.&lt;ref name=&quot;ENA Council seat&quot;&gt;{{cite web|first=|title=Seat of the Council of the European Union|date=|url=http://www.ena.lu?lang=2&amp;doc=5631|publisher=[[European NAvigator]]|accessdate=2008-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1965 agreement (finalised by the Edinburgh agreement and annexed to the treaties) on the location of the newly merged institutions, the Council was to be in Brussels but would meet in Luxembourg during April, June, and October. The ECSC secretariat moved from Luxembourg to the merged body Council secretariat in the Ravenstein building of Brussels. In 1971 the Council and its secretariat moved into the [[Charlemagne building]], next to the Commission's [[Berlaymont]], but the Council rapidly ran out of space and administrative branch of the Secretariat moved to a building at 76 Rue Joseph II/Jozef II-straat and during the 1980s the language divisions moved out into the Nerviens, Frère Orban, and Guimard buildings.&lt;ref name=&quot;ENA Council seat&quot;/&gt;

In 1995 the Council moved once more, into the [[Justus Lipsius building]], across the road from Charlemagne. However, its staff was still increasing, so it continued to rent the Frère Orban building to house the Finnish and Swedish language divisions. Staff continued to increase and the Council rented, in addition to owning Justus Lipsius, the Kortenberg, Froissart, Espace Rolin, and Woluwe Heights buildings. Since acquiring the [[Lex building]], the three aforementioned buildings are not used by the Council services any more as of 2008. [[Résidence Palace]]&lt;ref name=&quot;ENA Council seat&quot;/&gt; has been acquired and is currently being renovated; it will house the new press centre of the European Council, which uses the same facilities as the Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher = UIA Architectes|title = Call for Candidatures|year=2004|url=http://www.uia-architectes.org/texte/england/Residence/2residence.html|accessdate = 2007-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Council is meeting in Luxembourg, it meets in the Kirchberg Conference Centre&lt;ref name=&quot;ENA Council seat&quot;/&gt; and its offices are based at the European Centre on the plateau du Kirchberg.&lt;ref name=&quot;Council Booklet&quot;/&gt; The Council has also met occasionally in Strasbourg, in various other cities, and also outside the Union: for example in 1974 when it met in Tokyo  and Washington while trade and energy talks were taking place. Under the Council's present rules of procedures the Council can, in extraordinary circumstances, hold one of its meetings outside Brussels and Luxembourg.&lt;ref name=&quot;ENA Council seat&quot;/&gt;

=== Public access ===
Within the Council's debates, delegates may speak in any of the [[Languages of the European Union|23 official EU languages]]. Official documents are also translated into [[Catalan language|Catalan/Valencian]], [[Basque language|Basque]], and [[Galician language|Galician]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|Council of the European Union]]|title = FAQ: Application of the rules governing languages at the Council|url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/cms3_applications/faqHomePage.Asp?command=details&amp;node=21&amp;lang=en&amp;cmsId=1|accessdate = 2007-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the Lisbon Treaty, only minutes and voting records were made available when the Council is acting as a legislator (published in the ''Official Journal of the European Union'').&lt;ref name=&quot;Council Booklet&quot;/&gt; Since then all meetings where the Council is legislating are open to public viewing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Const Info&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Continental Europe.svg|thumb|300px|right|Continental Europe]]
'''Continental Europe''', also referred to as '''mainland Europe''' or simply '''the Continent''', is the [[continent]] of [[Europe]], explicitly excluding European [[island]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/Europe|title=Merriam Webster dictionary definition}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The most common definition of &quot;Continental Europe&quot; excludes [[Ireland]], [[Malta]], the [[United Kingdom]] and its dependencies, and [[Cyprus]].  Most definitions of Continental Europe extend the boundaries of the continent to its [[Boundaries between continents|standard]] boundaries, the [[Ural Mountains]], [[Ural River]], [[Caspian Sea]], and [[Caucasus Mountains]].

==Use in the United Kingdom==
In the [[United Kingdom]], ''the Continent'' is used to refer to the mainland of Europe. It is also referred to as &quot;mainland Europe&quot;. A famous, perhaps [[apocrypha]]l, [[United Kingdom|British]] newspaper headline once read &quot;Fog in [[English Channel|Channel]]; Continent Cut Off&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/europe/04/19/oakley.blog.dayten/index.html |title=Europe no star as election issue | work=CNN | date=2005-04-19 | accessdate=2010-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Derivatively, the adjective &quot;Continental&quot; refers to the social practices or fashion of continental Europe, as opposed to those in Britain. Examples include [[Continental breakfast|breakfast]] and, historically, long-range driving before Britain had [[motorways]].

==Republic of Ireland==
In the [[Republic of Ireland]], the term ''mainland Europe'' is more commonly used than the term ''continental Europe''. {{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} The latter term is used, though not to the same extent as in other countries.

==Scandinavia==
[[Image:Ptolemaios 1467 Scandinavia.jpg|thumb|Map of the Scandiae islands by [[Nicolaus Germanus]] for a 1467 publication of ''Cosmographia Claudii Ptolomaei Alexandrini''.]]
Especially in [[Germanic studies]], &quot;Continental&quot; refers to the European continent excluding the [[Scandinavian peninsula]], Britain, Ireland and Iceland. The reason for this is that although the Scandinavian peninsula is attached to Continental Europe by [[Karelia]] etc, it is usually reached by sea, not by land (which would require travelling north as far as [[Tornio]] at the [[66th parallel north]]). ''Kontinenten'' &amp;ndash; &quot;the Continent&quot; &amp;ndash; is a vernacular Swedish expression excluding [[Sweden]], [[Norway]] and [[Finland]], but including [[Denmark]] (even the [[Danish archipelago]]) and the rest of continental Europe. In Norway, similarly, one speaks about ''Kontinentet'' as a separate entity (in most cases referring to [[Germany]], [[France]] and the [[Benelux]] countries).

==Mediterranean and other Atlantic islands==
&quot;The continent&quot; may sometimes refer to the continental part of [[Italy]] (excluding [[Sardinia]], [[Sicily]], etc.), the continental part of [[Spain]] (as opposed to the [[Balearic islands]], the [[Canary Islands]], [[Alboran]], etc.), the continental part of [[France]] (as opposed to [[Corsica]], etc.), or the continental part of [[Portugal]] (as opposed to the [[Madeira Islands]] and [[Azores]].)

{{No footnotes|date=November 2009}}
'''Category theory''' is an area of study in [[mathematics]] that examines in an [[abstraction|abstract]] way the properties of particular mathematical concepts, by formalising them as collections of ''objects'' and ''arrows'' (also called [[morphism]]s, although this term also has a specific, non category-theoretical sense), where these collections satisfy certain basic conditions.  Many significant areas of mathematics can be formalised as categories, and the use of category theory allows many intricate and subtle mathematical results in these fields to be stated, and proved, in a much simpler way than without the use of categories.

The most accessible example of a category is the [[category of sets]], where the objects are sets and the arrows are functions from one set to another.  However it is important to note that the objects of a category need not be sets nor the arrows functions; any way of formalising a mathematical concept such that it meets the basic conditions on the behaviour of objects and arrows is a valid category, and all the results of category theory will apply to it.

One of the simplest examples of a category (which is a very important concept in [[topology]]) is that of [[groupoid]], defined as a  category whose arrows or morphisms are all invertible.
[[category (mathematics)|Categories]] now appear in most branches of mathematics, some areas of [[theoretical computer science]] where they correspond to [[Data type|types]], and [[mathematical physics]] where they can be used to describe [[vector space]]s. Categories were first introduced by [[Samuel Eilenberg]] and [[Saunders Mac Lane]] in 1942–45, in connection with [[algebraic topology]].

Category theory has several faces known not just to specialists, but to other mathematicians. A term dating from the 1940s, &quot;[[abstract nonsense|general abstract nonsense]]&quot;, refers to its high level of abstraction, compared to more classical branches of mathematics. [[Homological algebra]] is category theory in its aspect of organising and suggesting manipulations in [[abstract algebra]]. [[Diagram chasing]] is a visual method of arguing with abstract &quot;arrows&quot; joined in diagrams. Note that arrows between categories are called [[functor]]s, subject to specific defining commutativity conditions; moreover, categorical diagrams and sequences can be defined as functors (viz. Mitchell, 1965). An arrow between two functors is a [[natural transformation]] when it is subject to certain naturality or commutativity conditions. Functors and natural transformations ('naturality') are the key concepts in category theory.&lt;ref&gt;''Categories for the Working Mathematician'', 2nd Edition, p 18: &quot;As Eilenberg-Mac Lane first observed, 'category' has been defined in order to be able to define 'functor' and 'functor' has been defined in order to be able to define 'natural transformation' &quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Topos|Topos theory]] is a form of abstract [[Sheaf (mathematics)|sheaf theory]], with geometric origins, and leads to ideas such as [[pointless topology]]. A topos can also be considered as a specific type of category with two additional topos axioms.

== Background ==
The study of [[category (mathematics)|categories]] is an attempt to ''axiomatically'' capture what is commonly found in various classes of related ''mathematical structures'' by relating them to the ''structure-preserving functions'' between them. A systematic study of category theory then allows us to prove general results about any of these types of mathematical structures from the axioms of a category.

Consider the following example. The [[class (set theory)|class]] '''Grp''' of [[group (mathematics)|groups]] consists of all objects having a &quot;group structure&quot;. One can proceed to [[mathematical proof|prove]] [[theorem]]s about groups by making logical deductions from the set of axioms. For example, it is immediately proved from the axioms that the [[identity element]] of a group is unique.

Instead of focusing merely on the individual objects (e.g., groups) possessing a given structure, category theory emphasizes the [[morphism]]s – the structure-preserving mappings – ''between'' these objects; by studying these morphisms, we are able to learn more about the structure of the objects. In the case of groups, the morphisms are the [[group homomorphism]]s. A group homomorphism between two groups &quot;preserves the group structure&quot; in a precise sense – it is a &quot;process&quot; taking one group to another, in a way that carries along information about the structure of the first group into the second group. The study of group homomorphisms then provides a tool for studying general properties of groups and consequences of the group axioms.

A similar type of investigation occurs in many mathematical theories, such as the study of [[continuous function (topology)|continuous]] maps (morphisms) between [[topological space]]s in [[topology]] (the associated category is called '''Top'''), and the study of [[smooth function]]s (morphisms) in [[manifold theory]].

If one axiomatizes [[Finitary relation|relations]] instead of [[Function (mathematics)|function]]s, one obtains the theory of [[Allegory (category theory)|allegories]].

=== Functors ===
{{Main|Functor}}

Abstracting again, a category is ''itself'' a type of mathematical structure, so we can look for &quot;processes&quot; which preserve this structure in some sense; such a process is called a [[functor]]. A functor associates to every object of one category an object of another category, and to every morphism in the first category a morphism in the second.

In fact, what we have done is define a category ''of categories and functors'' – the objects are categories, and the morphisms (between categories) are functors.

By studying categories and functors, we are not just studying a class of mathematical structures and the morphisms between them; we are studying the ''relationships between various classes of mathematical structures''. This is a fundamental idea, which first surfaced in [[algebraic topology]]. Difficult ''topological'' questions can be translated into ''algebraic'' questions which are often easier to solve.  Basic constructions, such as the [[fundamental group]] or [http://planetphysics.org/encyclopedia/FundamentalGroupoidFunctor.html fundamental groupoid] of a [[topological space]], can be expressed as [http://planetphysics.org/encyclopedia/FundamentalGroupoidFunctor.html fundamental functors] to the category of [[groupoid]]s in this way, and the concept is pervasive in algebra and its applications.

=== Natural transformation ===
{{Main|Natural transformation}}

Abstracting yet again, constructions are often &quot;naturally related&quot; – a vague notion, at first sight. This leads to the clarifying concept of [[natural transformation]], a way to &quot;map&quot; one functor to another. Many important constructions in mathematics can be studied in this context. &quot;Naturality&quot; is a principle, like [[general covariance]] in physics, that cuts deeper than is initially apparent.

==Historical notes==
In 1942–45, [[Samuel Eilenberg]] and [[Saunders Mac Lane]] introduced categories, functors, and natural transformations as part of their work in topology, especially [[algebraic topology]]. Their work was an important part of the transition from intuitive and geometric [[Homology (mathematics)|homology]] to [[axiom]]atic [[homology theory]]. Eilenberg and Mac Lane later wrote that their goal was to understand natural transformations; in order to do that, functors had to be defined, which required categories.

[[Stanisław Ulam]], and some writing on his behalf, have claimed that related ideas were current in the late 1930s in Poland. Eilenberg was Polish, and studied mathematics in Poland in the 1930s. Category theory is also, in some sense, a continuation of the work of [[Emmy Noether]] (one of Mac Lane's teachers) in formalizing abstract processes; Noether realized that in order to understand a type of mathematical structure, one needs to understand the processes preserving that structure. In order to achieve this understanding, Eilenberg and Mac Lane proposed an axiomatic formalization of the relation between structures and the processes preserving them. 

The subsequent development of category theory was powered first by the computational needs of [[homological algebra]], and later by the axiomatic needs of [[algebraic geometry]], the field most resistant to being grounded in either [[axiomatic set theory]] or the [[Russell-Whitehead]] view of united foundations. General category theory, an extension of [[universal algebra]] having many new features allowing for [[semantic]] flexibility and [[higher-order logic]], came later; it is now applied throughout mathematics.

Certain categories called [[topos|topoi]] (singular ''topos'') can even serve as an alternative to [[axiomatic set theory]] as a foundation of mathematics. These foundational applications of category theory have been worked out in fair detail as a basis for, and justification of, [[Constructivism (mathematics)|constructive mathematics]]. More recent efforts to introduce undergraduates to categories as a foundation for mathematics include [[William Lawvere|Lawvere]] and Rosebrugh (2003) and Lawvere and Schanuel (1997).

[[Categorical logic]] is now a well-defined field based on [[type theory]] for [[intuitionistic logic]]s, with applications in  [[functional programming]] and [[domain theory]], where a [[cartesian closed category]] is taken as a non-syntactic description of a [[lambda calculus]]. At the very least, category theoretic language clarifies what exactly these related areas have in common (in some [[Wiktionary:abstract|abstract]] sense).

==Categories, objects, and morphisms==
{{Main|Category (mathematics)|Morphism}}

A ''category'' ''C'' consists of the following three mathematical entities:
* A [[Class (set theory)|class]] ob(''C''), whose elements are called ''objects'';
* A class hom(''C''), whose elements are called [[morphism]]s or [[Map (mathematics)|maps]] or ''arrows''. Each morphism '''''f''''' has a unique ''source object '''a''''' and ''target object '''b'''''. &lt;br/&gt;The expression ''f'': ''a'' → ''b'', would be verbally stated as &quot;''f'' is a morphism from ''a'' to ''b''&quot;.&lt;br/&gt;The expression '''hom(''a'', ''b'')''' — alternatively expressed as '''hom(''a'', ''b'')''', or '''hom&lt;sub&gt;''C''&lt;/sub&gt;(''a'', ''b'')''', or '''mor(''a'', ''b'')''', or '''''C''(''a'', ''b'')''' — denotes the ''hom-class'' of all morphisms from ''a'' to ''b''.
* A [[binary operation]] &lt;math&gt;\circ&lt;/math&gt;, called ''composition of morphisms'', such that for any three objects ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'', we have hom(''a'', ''b'') &amp;times; hom(''b'', ''c'') → hom(''a'', ''c''). The composition of ''f'': ''a'' → ''b'' and ''g'': ''b'' → ''c'' is written as &lt;math&gt;g\circ f&lt;/math&gt; or ''gf'',&lt;ref&gt;Some authors compose in the opposite order, writing  ''fg'' or &lt;math&gt;f\circ g&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;g\circ f&lt;/math&gt;.  Computer scientists using category theory very commonly write ''f;g'' for &lt;math&gt;g\circ f&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; governed by two axioms:
:* [[Associativity]]: If ''f'' : ''a'' → ''b'', ''g'' : ''b'' → ''c'' and ''h'' : ''c'' → ''d'' then &lt;math&gt;h\circ(g\circ f)=(h\circ g)\circ f&lt;/math&gt;, and
:* [[Identity (mathematics)|Identity]]: For every object ''x'', there exists a morphism 1&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; : ''x'' → ''x'' called the ''[[identity morphism]] for x'', such that for every morphism ''f'' : ''a'' → ''b'', we have &lt;math&gt;{\rm 1}_b\circ f=f=f\circ{\rm 1}_a&lt;/math&gt;.

From these axioms, it can be proved that there is exactly one [[identity morphism]] for every object. Some authors deviate from the definition just given by identifying each object with its identity morphism.

Relations among morphisms (such as ''fg'' = ''h'') are often depicted using [[commutative diagram]]s, with &quot;points&quot; (corners) representing objects and &quot;arrows&quot; representing morphisms.

===Properties of morphisms===
[[Morphism]]s can have any of the following properties. A morphism ''f'' : ''a'' → ''b'' is a:
* [[monomorphism]] (or ''monic'') if ''f''&lt;small&gt;o&lt;/small&gt;''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''f''&lt;small&gt;o&lt;/small&gt;''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; implies ''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; for all morphisms ''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''g&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' : ''x'' → ''a''.
* [[epimorphism]] (or ''epic'') if ''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;small&gt;o&lt;/small&gt;''f'' = ''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;small&gt;o&lt;/small&gt;''f'' implies ''g&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''g&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' for all morphisms ''g&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''g&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' : ''b'' → ''x''.
* ''bimorphism'' if ''f'' is both epic and monic.
* [[isomorphism]] if there exists a morphism ''g'' : ''b'' → ''a'' such that ''f''&lt;small&gt;o&lt;/small&gt;''g'' = 1&lt;sub&gt;''b''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''g''&lt;small&gt;o&lt;/small&gt;''f'' = 1&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Note that a morphism that is both epic and monic is not necessarily an isomorphism! An elementary counterexample: in the category consisting of two objects ''A'' and ''B'', the identity morphisms, and a single morphism ''f'' from ''A'' to ''B'', ''f'' is both epic and monic but is not an isomorphism.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[endomorphism]] if ''a'' = ''b''. end(''a'') denotes the class of endomorphisms of ''a''.
* [[automorphism]] if ''f'' is both an endomorphism and an isomorphism. aut(''a'') denotes the class of automorphisms of ''a''.
* [[retract (category theory)|retraction]] if a right inverse of ''f'' exists, i.e. if there exists a morphism ''g'' : ''b'' → ''a'' with ''fg'' = 1&lt;sub&gt;''b''&lt;/sub&gt;.
* [[section (category theory)|section]] if a left inverse of ''f'' exists, i.e. if there exists a morphism ''g'' : ''b'' → ''a'' with ''gf'' = 1&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt;.

Every retraction is an epimorphism, and every section is a monomorphism. Hence the following three statements are equivalent:
* ''f'' is a monomorphism and a retraction;
* ''f'' is an epimorphism and a section;
* ''f'' is an isomorphism.

==Functors==
{{Main|Functor}}

[[Functor]]s are structure-preserving maps between categories. They can be thought of as morphisms in the category of all (small) categories.

A ('''covariant''') functor ''F'' from a category ''C'' to a category ''D'', written ''F'':''C'' → ''D'', consists of:
* for each object ''x'' in ''C'', an object ''F''(''x'') in ''D''; and
* for each morphism ''f'' : ''x'' → ''y'' in ''C'', a morphism ''F''(''f'') : ''F''(''x'') → ''F''(''y''),

such that the following two properties hold:
* For every object ''x'' in ''C'', ''F''(1&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;) = 1&lt;sub&gt;''F''(''x'')&lt;/sub&gt;;
* For all morphisms ''f'' : ''x'' → ''y'' and ''g'' : ''y'' → ''z'', &lt;math&gt;F(g\circ f)=F(g)\circ F(f).&lt;/math&gt;

A '''contravariant''' functor ''F'': ''C'' → ''D'', is like a covariant functor, except that it &quot;turns morphisms around&quot; (&quot;reverses all the arrows&quot;). More specifically, every morphism ''f'' : ''x'' → ''y'' in ''C'' must be assigned to a morphism  ''F''(''f'') : ''F''(''y'') → ''F''(''x'') in ''D''. In other words, a contravariant functor is a covariant functor from the [[opposite category]] ''C''&lt;sup&gt;op&lt;/sup&gt; to ''D''.

==Natural transformations and isomorphisms==
{{Main|Natural transformation}}

A ''natural transformation'' is a relation between two functors. Functors often describe &quot;natural constructions&quot; and natural transformations then describe &quot;natural homomorphisms&quot; between two such constructions. Sometimes two quite different constructions yield &quot;the same&quot; result; this is expressed by a natural isomorphism between the two functors.

If ''F'' and ''G'' are (covariant) functors between the categories ''C'' and ''D'', then a natural transformation η from ''F'' to ''G'' associates to every object ''X'' in ''C'' a morphism η&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; : ''F''(''X'') → ''G''(''X'') in ''D'' such that for every morphism ''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y'' in ''C'', we have η&lt;sub&gt;''Y''&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;small&gt;o&lt;/small&gt; ''F''(''f'') = ''G''(''f'') &lt;small&gt;o&lt;/small&gt; η&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;; this means that the following diagram is [[commutative diagram|commutative]]:

[[Image:Natural transformation.svg|175px|center|Commutative diagram defining natural transformations]]

The two functors ''F'' and ''G'' are called ''naturally isomorphic'' if there exists a natural transformation from ''F'' to ''G'' such that η&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; is an isomorphism for every object ''X'' in ''C''.

==Universal constructions, limits, and colimits==
{{Main|Universal property|Limit (category theory)}}

Using the language of category theory, many areas of mathematical study can be cast into appropriate categories, such as the categories of all sets, groups, topologies, and so on. These categories surely have some objects that are &quot;special&quot; in a certain way, such as the [[empty set]] or the [[product topology|product of two topologies]], yet in the definition of a category, objects are considered to be atomic, i.e., we ''do not know'' whether an object ''A'' is a set, a topology, or any other abstract concept – hence, the challenge is to define special objects without referring to the internal structure of those objects. But how can we define the empty set without referring to elements, or the product topology without referring to open sets?

The solution is to characterize these objects in terms of their relations to other objects, as given by the morphisms of the respective categories. Thus, the task is to find ''[[universal property|universal properties]]'' that uniquely determine the objects of interest. Indeed, it turns out that numerous important constructions can be described in a purely categorical way. The central concept which is needed for this purpose is called categorical ''[[limit (category theory)|limit]]'', and can be dualized to yield the notion of a ''colimit''.

==Equivalent categories==
{{Main|Equivalence of categories|Isomorphism of categories}}

It is a natural question to ask: under which conditions can two categories be considered to be &quot;essentially the same&quot;, in the sense that theorems about one category can readily be transformed into theorems about the other category? The major tool one employs to describe such a situation is called ''equivalence of categories'', which is given by appropriate functors between two categories. Categorical equivalence has found numerous applications in mathematics.

==Further concepts and results==
The definitions of categories and functors provide only the very basics of categorical algebra; additional important topics are listed below. Although there are strong interrelations between all of these topics, the given order can be considered as a guideline for further reading.
* The [[functor category]] ''D''&lt;sup&gt;''C''&lt;/sup&gt; has as objects the functors from ''C'' to ''D'' and as morphisms the natural transformations of such functors. The [[Yoneda lemma]] is one of the most famous basic results of category theory; it describes representable functors in functor categories.
* [[Dual (category theory)|Duality]]: Every statement, theorem, or definition in category theory has a ''dual'' which is essentially obtained by &quot;reversing all the arrows&quot;. If one statement is true in a category ''C'' then its dual will be true in the dual category ''C''&lt;sup&gt;op&lt;/sup&gt;. This duality, which is transparent at the level of category theory, is often obscured in applications and can lead to surprising relationships.
* [[Adjoint functors]]: A functor can be left (or right) adjoint to another functor that maps in the opposite direction. Such a pair of adjoint functors typically arises from a construction defined by a universal property; this can be seen as a more abstract and powerful view on universal properties.

==Higher-dimensional categories==
Many of the above concepts, especially equivalence of categories, adjoint functor pairs, and functor categories, can be situated into the context of ''higher-dimensional categories''. Briefly, if we consider a morphism between two objects as a &quot;process taking us from one object to another&quot;, then higher-dimensional categories allow us to profitably generalize this by considering &quot;higher-dimensional processes&quot;.

For example, a (strict) [[2-category]] is a category together with &quot;morphisms between morphisms&quot;, i.e., processes which allow us to transform one morphism into another. We can then &quot;compose&quot; these &quot;bimorphisms&quot; both horizontally and vertically, and we require a 2-dimensional &quot;exchange law&quot; to hold, relating the two composition laws. In this context, the standard example is '''Cat''', the 2-category of all (small) categories, and in this example, bimorphisms of morphisms are simply [[natural transformation]]s of morphisms in the usual sense. Another basic example is to consider a 2-category with a single object; these are essentially [[monoidal category|monoidal categories]]. [[bicategory|Bicategories]] are a weaker notion of 2-dimensional categories in which the composition of morphisms is not strictly associative, but only associative &quot;up to&quot; an isomorphism.

This process can be extended for all [[natural number]]s ''n'', and these are called [[n-category|''n''-categories]]. There is even a notion of ''[[ω-category]]'' corresponding to the [[ordinal number]] [[ω (ordinal number)|ω]].

Higher-dimensional categories are part of the broader mathematical field of [[higher-dimensional algebra]], a concept introduced by [[Ronald Brown (mathematician)|Ronald Brown]].  For a conversational introduction to these ideas, see [http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/week73.html John Baez, 'A Tale of ''n''-categories' (1996).]

'''Bradycardia''' ([[Greek language|Greek]] βραδυκαρδία, ''bradykardía'', &quot;heart slowness&quot;), in the context of adult medicine, is the resting [[heart rate]] of under 60 beats per minute, though it is seldom symptomatic until the rate drops below 50 beat/min. It may cause [[cardiac arrest]] in some patients, because those with bradycardia may not be pumping enough oxygen to their heart. It sometimes results in fainting, shortness of breath, and if severe enough, death.&lt;ref name=SINUS-BRADYCARDIA&gt;[http://www.emedicine.com/emerg/topic534.htm Sinus Bradycardia] eMedicine&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mountsinai.org/Patient%20Care/Service%20Areas/Heart/Diseases%20and%20Conditions?citype=Disease&amp;ciid=Bradycardia Bradycardia] at [[Mount Sinai Hospital, New York|Mount Sinai Hospital]]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Trained [[sportsperson|athlete]]s or young healthy individuals may also have a slow resting heart rate (e.g. professional cyclist [[Miguel Indurain]] had a resting heart rate of 29 beats per minute).&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/other_sports/cycling/tour_de_france_2004/history/3772501.stm 1991-1995: Big Mig's masterclass, BBC, August 3, 2004]&lt;/ref&gt; Resting bradycardia is often considered normal if the individual has no other symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, dizziness, lightheadedness, fainting, chest discomfort, [[palpitations]] or shortness of breath associated with it. 

The term ''relative bradycardia'' is used in explaining a heart rate which although not actually below 60 beats per minute still is considered too slow for the individual's current medical condition.

==Definition==
Bradycardia in an adult is any heart rate less than 60 beats&amp;nbsp;per&amp;nbsp;minute, although symptoms usually manifest only for heart rates less than 50.&lt;ref name=ACLS2010/&gt;

==Classification==
===Atrial===
{{see also|Sinus bradycardia|Sick sinus syndrome}}
Atrial bradycardias come in three different types. The first is [[sinus bradycardia]]. This is usually found in young and healthy adults. The symptoms represent with the individual's [[respiration (physiology)|respiration]]s. Each [[inhalation]] corresponds with the heart rate decreasing. [[Exhalation|Expiration]] causes an increase in the heart's rate of contraction. This is thought to be caused by changes in the vagal tone during respiration.&lt;ref name=HN&gt;{{cite book|title=Harwood-Nuss' Clinical Practice of Emergency Medicine|editor=Allan B. Wolfson|year=2005|edition=4th|page=260|isbn=0-7817-5125-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sinus bradycardia is a sinus rhythm of less than 60 bpm. It is a common condition found in both healthy individuals and those who are considered well [[Athletic heart syndrome|conditioned athletes]]. Studies have found that 50 - 85 percent of conditioned athletes have [[benign]] sinus bradycardia, as compared to 23 percent of the general population studied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ward|first=Bryan G.|coauthors=Rippe, JM|title=Athletic Heart Syndrome|publisher=Clinical Sports Medicine|year=1992|page=259|chapter=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for this is that their heart muscle has become conditioned to have a higher stroke volume and therefore requires fewer contractions to circulate the same volume of blood.&lt;ref name=HN/&gt;

[[Sick sinus syndrome]] covers conditions that include severe sinus bradycardia, sinoatrial block, sinus arrest, and bradycardi-tachycardia syndrome (atrial fibillation, flutter, and paroxysmal supraventricular [[tachycardia]]).&lt;ref name=HN/&gt;

===Atrioventricular nodal===
{{See also|Junctional rhythm}}
An atrioventricular nodal bradycardia or AV junction rhythm is usually caused by the absence of the electrical impulse from the [[sinus node]]. This usually appears on an [[EKG]] with a normal [[QRS complex]] accompanied with an inverted P wave either before, during, or after the QRS complex.&lt;ref name=HN/&gt;

An AV junctional escape is a delayed heartbeat originating from an [[ectopic]] focus somewhere in the [[AV junction]]. It occurs when the rate of [[depolarization]] of the SA node falls below the rate of the AV node.&lt;ref name=HN/&gt; This dysrhythmia also may occur when the electrical impulses from the SA node fail to reach the AV node because of SA or AV block.&lt;ref name=AHA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=746|title=AV Junctional Rhythm Disturbances (for Professionals)|date=2008-12-04|publisher=American Heart Association|accessdate=15 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a protective mechanism for the heart, to compensate for a SA node that is no longer handling the pacemaking activity, and is one of a series of backup sites that can take over pacemaker function when the SA node fails to do so. This would present with a longer [[PR interval]]. A junctional escape complex is a normal response that may result from excessive vagal tone on the SA node. Pathological causes include sinus bradycardia, sinus arrest, sinus exit block, or AV block.&lt;ref name=HN/&gt;

===Ventricular===
{{See also|Atrioventricular block}}
A ventricular bradycardia, also known as ventricular escape rhythm or idioventricular rhythm, is a heart rate of less than 50 beats a minute. This is a safety mechanism that arises when there is lack of electrical impulse or stimuli from the atrium.&lt;ref name=HN/&gt; Impulses originating from or below the His bundle, also known as ventricular, will produce a wide QRS complex with heart rates between 20 and 40 beats a minute. Those above the His bundle, also known as junctional, will typically range between 40 and 60 bpm with a narrow QRS complex.&lt;ref name=&quot;merck&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merck.com/mmpe/sec07/ch075/ch075a.html|title=Arrhythmias and Conduction Disorders|date=2008-01|work=The merck Manuals: Online Medical Library|publisher=Merck Sharp and Dohme Corp|accessdate=16 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ajcc/&gt; In a third degree heart block, approximately 61% take place at the bundle branch-Purkinje system, 21% at the AV node, and 15% at the His bundle.&lt;ref name=ajcc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ajcc.aacnjournals.org/cgi/content/full/12/5/477|title=Ventricular Escape Rhythms|last=Adams|first=Mary|coauthors=Pelter, M|year=2003|publisher=American Journal of Critical Care|pages=12: 477–478 |accessdate=15 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; AV block maybe ruled out with an EKG indicating &quot;a 1:1 relationship between P waves and QRS complexes.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;merck&quot;/&gt; Ventricular bradycardias occurs with sinus bradycardia, sinus arrest, and AV block. Treatment often consist of the administration of [[atropine]] and cardiac pacing.&lt;ref name=HN/&gt;

===Infantile===
For infants, bradycardia is defined as a heart rate of less than 100 beats per minute. (Normal is around 120-160 beats per minute.) Premature babies are more likely than full-term babies to have apnea and bradycardia spells; their cause is not clearly understood. Some researchers think the spells are related to centers inside the brain that regulate breathing and that may not be fully developed. Touching the baby gently or rocking the incubator slightly will almost always get the baby to start breathing again, which increases the heart rate. Medications ([[theophylline]] or [[caffeine]]) can be used to treat these spells in babies if necessary. [[NICU]] standard practice is to electronically monitor the heart and lungs for this reason.

==Causes==
This [[cardiac arrhythmia]] can be underlain by several causes, which are best divided into cardiac and non-cardiac causes.
Non-cardiac causes are usually secondary, and can involve [[recreational drug use|drug]] use or [[drug abuse|abuse]]; [[metabolism|metabolic]] or [[endocrine]] issues, especially in the [[hypothyroidism|thyroid]]; an [[electrolyte]] imbalance; [[:Category:Neurology|neurologic]] factors; autonomic reflexes; situational factors such as prolonged [[bed rest]]; and [[autoimmune|autoimmunity]].
Cardiac causes include acute or chronic [[ischemic heart disease]], vascular [[heart disease]], valvular heart disease, or degenerative primary electrical disease.
Ultimately, the causes act by three mechanisms: depressed automaticity of the heart, conduction block, or escape pacemakers and rhythms.

There are generally two types of problems that result in bradycardias: disorders of the [[sinoatrial node]] (SA node), and disorders of the [[atrioventricular node]] (AV node).

With sinus node dysfunction (sometimes called [[sick sinus syndrome]]), there may be disordered [[automaticity]] or impaired conduction of the impulse from the sinus node into the surrounding atrial tissue (an &quot;exit block&quot;). Only second degree sinostrial blocks can be detected by use of a 12-lead EKG.&lt;ref name=NCBI&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16308110|title=Bradydysrhythmias and atrioventricular conduction blocks|last=Ufberg |first=JW |coauthors=Clark JS.|date=2006-02|work=Emergency Medicine Clininics of North America|publisher=National Center for Biotechnology Information|pages=24(1):1–9, v.|accessdate=15 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is difficult and sometimes impossible to assign a mechanism to any particular bradycardia, but the underlying mechanism is not clinically relevant to treatment, which is the same in both cases of sick sinus syndrome: a permanent [[artificial pacemaker|pacemaker]].

Atrioventricular conduction disturbances (aka: AV block; [[First degree AV block|1&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; AV block]], [[Second degree AV block|2&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; type I AV block]], [[Second degree AV block|2&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; type II AV block]], [[Third degree AV block|3&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; AV block]]) may result from impaired conduction in the AV node, or anywhere below it, such as in the [[Bundle of His]]. The clinical relevance pertaining to AV blocks is greater than that of sinoatrial blocks.&lt;ref name=NCBI/&gt;

Patients with bradycardia have likely acquired it, as opposed to having it [[congenital]]ly.
Bradycardia is more common in older patients.

==Diagnosis==
A diagnosis of bradycardia in adults is based on a heart rate less than 60.  This is determined usually either via palpation or an ECG.

If symptoms occur, a determination of electrolytes may be helpful in determining the underlying cause.

==Management==
The treatment of bradycardia is dependent on whether or not the person is stable or unstable.&lt;ref name=ACLS2010/&gt; If [[oxygen saturations]] are low supplemental oxygen should be provided.&lt;ref name=ACLS2010/&gt;

===Stable===
Emergent treatment is not needed if the person is asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic.&lt;ref name=ACLS2010&gt;{{cite journal |author=Neumar RW, Otto CW, Link MS, ''et al.'' |title=Part 8: adult advanced cardiovascular life support: 2010 American Heart Association Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care |journal=Circulation |volume=122 |issue=18 Suppl 3 |pages=S729–67 |year=2010 |month=November |pmid=20956224 |doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.110.970988 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unstable===
If a person is unstable the initial recommended treatment is intravenous [[atropine]].&lt;ref name=ACLS2010/&gt; Doses less than 0.5&amp;nbsp;mg should not be used as this may further decrease the rate.&lt;ref name=ACLS2010/&gt; If this is not effective intravenous [[inotrope]] infusion ([[dopamine]], [[epinephrine]]) or [[transcutaneous pacing]] should be used.&lt;ref name=ACLS2010/&gt; [[Transvenous pacing]] may be required if the cause of the bradycardia is not rapidly reversible.&lt;ref name=ACLS2010/&gt;

'''Canada Day''' ({{lang-fr|Fête du Canada}}), formerly [[Dominion Day]] ({{lang-fr|Le Jour de la Confédération}}), is [[Canada]]'s [[National Day|national day]], a [[Public holidays in Canada|federal statutory holiday]] celebrating the anniversary of the July 1, 1867, enactment of the [[British North America Acts#British North America Act, 1867|British North America Act]] (today called the [[Constitution Act, 1867]]), which united two British colonies and a province of the [[British Empire]] into a single country within the empire called Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www1.canadiana.org/citm/themes/constitution/constitution13_e.html| title=Canada in the Making &gt; Constitutional History &gt; 1867–1931: Becoming a Nation| publisher=Canadiana| accessdate=July 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://atlas.nrcan.gc.ca/auth/english/maps/historical/territorialevolution/1867/1| last=Department of Natural Resources| authorlink=Natural Resources Canada| title=Natural Resources Canada &gt; Atlas Home &gt; Explore Our Maps &gt; History &gt; Territorial Evolution &gt; Territorial Evolution, 1867| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| accessdate=July 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last=Moore| first=Christopher | title=1867: How the Fathers Made a Deal| publisher=McClelland &amp; Stewart| year=1998| location=Toronto| pages=1, 215| url=http://books.google.com/?id=Xumx9T6CrcIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;q| isbn=9780771060960}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canada Day observances take place throughout Canada as well as internationally.

==History==
[[File:Jubilee celebrations on Parliament Hill.jpg|thumb|right|Crowds on [[Parliament Hill]] celebrate [[Dominion Day]], 1927, the 60th jubilee of confederation]]
On June 20, 1868, [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] [[Charles Stanley Monck, 4th Viscount Monck|the Viscount Monck]] issued a royal [[proclamation]] asking for [[Canadians]] to &quot;celebrate the anniversary of the confederation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.pch.gc.ca/pgm/ceem-cced/jfa-ha/canada-eng.cfm| last=Department of Canadian Heritage| authorlink=Department of Canadian Heritage| title=Ceremonial and Canadian Symbols Promotion &gt; Canada Day| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| accessdate=July 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the holiday was not established statutorily until 1879, when it was designated as [[Dominion Day]], in reference to the designation of the country as a ''[[Dominion]]'' in the British North America Act. The holiday was initially not dominant in the national calendar; up to the early 20th century, Canadians thought themselves to be primarily British, being thus less interested in celebrating distinctly Canadian forms of patriotism. No official celebrations were therefore held until 1917—the golden anniversary of Confederation—and then none again for a further decade.&lt;ref name=CanoeBkg&gt;{{cite news| last=Canadian Heritage| title=Canada Day Background/How we got our national holiday| publisher=Canoe| url=http://www.canoe.ca/Canadiana/canday.html| accessdate=July 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946, [[Philéas Côté]], a Quebec member of the [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]], introduced a [[private member's bill]] to rename Dominion Day as Canada Day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last=Carnegie| first=R.K.| title=Drew Right: Provinces Have Say-So On Holidays| newspaper=The Globe and Mail| page=15| date=April 19, 1946| ref=harv| postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; His bill was passed quickly by the House of Commons but was stalled by the [[Senate of Canada|Senate]], which returned the bill to the Commons with the recommendation that the holiday be renamed ''The National Holiday of Canada'', an amendment that effectively killed the bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last=Editorial Board| title=A New Low in Compromise| newspaper=The Globe and Mail| page=6| date=August 10, 1946}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Barrie Canada Day Fireworks.png|thumb|left|Canada Day fireworks in [[Barrie]], Ontario]]

Beginning in 1958, the Canadian government began to orchestrate Dominion Day celebrations, usually consisting of [[Trooping the Colour]] ceremonies on [[Parliament Hill]] in the afternoon and evening, followed by a mass band concert and fireworks display. [[Canadian Centennial|Canada's centennial]] in 1967 is often seen as an important milestone in the history of Canadian patriotism, and in Canada's maturing as a distinct, independent country, after which Dominion Day became more popular with average Canadians. Into the late 1960s, nationally televised, multi-cultural concerts held in [[Ottawa]] were added, and the fête became known as ''Festival Canada''; after 1980 the Canadian government began to promote the celebrating of Dominion Day beyond the national capital, giving grants and aid to cities across the country to help fund local activities.

With only twelve Members of Parliament present, eight less than a [[quorum]],&lt;ref name=Quorum&gt;{{Cite book| last=Marleau| first=Robert| last2=Montpetit| first2=Camille| title=House of Commons Procedure and Practice| place=Ottawa| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| date=January 2000| url=http://www2.parl.gc.ca/MarleauMontpetit/DocumentViewer.aspx?Sec=Ch09&amp;Seq=3&amp;Lang=E| chapter=9.

Although the proposal caused some controversy,&lt;ref name=CBC /&gt; many Canadians had already been informally referring to the holiday as ''Canada Day'' for a number of years before the official name change occurred.{{#tag:ref|Numerous references to the term ''Canada Day'' may be found in issues of ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' published in the late 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title=Across Canada/Pro-Canada sign painter has brush with law| newspaper=The Globe and Mail| page=12| date=November 19, 1977| ref=harv| postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last=Cherry| first=Zena| title=Protocol chiefs gather to discuss their trade| newspaper=The Globe and Mail| page=27| date=February 20, 1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last=Stevens| first=Geoffrey| title=With many tongues| newspaper=The Globe and Mail| page=6| date=March 2, 1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last=Canadian Press| title=Federal support for new festival| newspaper=The Globe and Mail| page=16| date=March 30, 1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=n|name=Name}} Columnist Andrew Cohen called ''Canada Day'' a term of &quot;crushing banality&quot; and criticized the change from ''Dominion Day'' as being &quot;a renunciation of the past [and] a misreading of history, laden with political correctness and historical ignorance.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Andrew| first=Cohen| title=The Unfinished Canadian| publisher=McClelland &amp; Stewart| year=2007| location=Toronto| page=90| url=http://books.google.com/?id=glcBcaMC6doC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Andrew%2C%20Cohen%20(2007).%20The%20Unfinished%20Canadian.&amp;pg=PA90#v=onepage&amp;q=Andrew,%20Cohen%20(2007).%20The%20Unfinished%20Canadian.| isbn=978-0771022869| ref=CITEREF_Cohen_2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Cohen, the change is an example of systemic denial of Canadian history by the Canadian government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb| Cohen| 2007| p=89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the anniversary of Confederation, Dominion Day, and later Canada Day, was the date set for a number of important events, such as the first national radio network hookup by the Canadian National Railway (1927), the inauguration of the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]]'s cross-country [[television]] broadcast (1958), the flooding of the [[Saint Lawrence Seaway]] (1958), the first colour television transmission in Canada (1966), the inauguration of the [[Order of Canada]] (1967), and the establishment of &quot;[[O Canada]]&quot; as the country's [[national anthem]] (1980). Other events fell on the same day coincidentally, such as the [[first day on the Somme|first day of the Battle of the Somme]] in 1916—shortly after which [[Dominion of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]] recognized July 1 as [[Memorial Day (Newfoundland and Labrador)|Memorial Day]] to commemorate the [[Newfoundland Regiment]]'s heavy losses during the battle&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.heritage.nf.ca/society/custom.html| last=Hiscock| first=Philip| title=Society and Culture &gt; Folklore and Traditional Culture &gt; Custom| publisher=Memorial University of Newfoundland| accessdate=June 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.mun.ca/memorial/living/memorial_day.php| title=A Living Memorial &gt; Memorial Day| publisher=Memorial University of Newfoundland| accessdate=May 31, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;—and the enactment of the [[Chinese Immigration Act, 1923|Chinese Immigration Act]] in 1923—leading [[Chinese-Canadian]]s to refer to July 1 as ''Humiliation Day'' and boycott Dominion Day celebrations until the act was repealed in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=CBC News &gt; Indepth &gt; China &gt; Chinese Immigration| publisher=CBC| date=June 10, 2004| url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/china/chinese_immigration.html| accessdate=July 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given the federal nature of the holiday, celebrating Canada Day can be a cause of friction in the province of [[Quebec]], where the holiday is overshadowed by Quebec's [[National Holiday (Quebec)|National Holiday]], on June 24.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last=Fedio| first=Chloe| title=Canada Day Parade organizers bemoan lack of political support| newspaper=The Gazette| date=June 17, 2010| url=http://www.montrealgazette.com/health/Canada+Parade+organizers+bemoan+lack+political+support/3164763/story.html| accessdate=July 1, 2010}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the federal government funds events at the [[Old Port of Montreal]]—an area run by a federal [[Crown corporations of Canada|Crown corporation]]—while the parade is a [[grassroots]] effort that has been met with pressure to cease, even from federal officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last=Hustake| first=Aalan| title=Proud Canadian, proud Quebecer who loved a parade| newspaper=The Gazette| date=May 25, 2008| url=http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/news/insight/story.html?id=069c09a6-3deb-4246-8e2e-a7d5324b8b26| accessdate=May 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nature of the event has also been met with criticism from [[English Canadian]]s, such as ''[[Ottawa Citizen]]'' columnist [[David Warren (columnist)|David Warren]], who said in 2007: &quot;The Canada of the government-funded paper flag-waving and painted faces—the 'new' Canada that is celebrated each year on what is now called 'Canada Day'—has nothing controversially Canadian about it.

The '''Claudine''' books are a series of four early novels by the French author [[Colette]] published from 1900-1904.&lt;ref name=Southworth2004 &gt;{{citation | last=Southworth | first=Helen | year=2004 | title=The intersecting realities and fictions of Virginia Woolf and Colette | publisher=Ohio State University Press | isbn=9780814251362 | url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=TP_q7KHL1EkC  | page=111 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The stories are the diaries of protagonist Claudine, which outline the education and growing up of the young girl, who is aged fifteen at the beginning of the first novel ''[[Claudine à l'école]]''.&lt;ref name=Southworth2004 /&gt; All of the novels are written in [[first-person narrative]] with the first three in the series implementing Claudine as the narrator. The last in the series, ''Claudine s'en va'', introduces a new narrator Annie.&lt;ref name=Southworth2004 /&gt;

The novels were written in the late 19th century, in collaboration with Colette’s first husband, [[Henry Gauthier-Villars]], better known by his [[nom-de-plume]] Willy, who was also a writer. There has been much speculation over the degree of involvement of both Colette and Willy in the writing, particularly as Willy was known for having [[ghostwriters]] of his literary publications. Resultantly, the Claudine novels, were originally attributed under Willy’s name only, before later being published under both names. After the death of Willy, Colette went to court to challenge her former husband's involvement in the writing, and subsequently had his name removed from the books. This however was overturned after her death, as Willy’s son from a prior relationship, [[Jacques Gautheir-Villars]], sued to have his father’s name restored, which was carried out.&lt;ref name=Southworth2004 /&gt;

The Claudine novels are thought to be roughly [[autobiography|autobiographical]].&lt;ref name=Southworth2004 /&gt; Whilst the stories were shocking in their time, this affectionate portrayal of a forthright and self-assured French girl who blossoms into a charismatic adult is nowadays more likely to be regarded as chastely sensual.

It is sometimes also called '''[[coronary heart disease]]''' (CHD), although CAD is the most common cause of CHD, it is not the only one.

CAD is the leading cause of death worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mountsinai.org/Other/Diseases/Coronary%20artery%20disease Coronary artery disease] at [[Mount Sinai Hospital, New York|ospital]]&lt;/ref&gt; While the symptoms and signs of coronary artery disease are noted in the advanced state of disease, most individuals with coronary artery disease show no evidence of disease for decades as the disease progresses before the first onset of symptoms, often a &quot;sudden&quot; [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]], finally arises.  After decades of progression, some of these [[atheroma|atheromatous plaques]] may rupture and (along with the activation of the [[blood clot]]ting system) start limiting [[blood flow]] to the [[cardiac muscle|heart muscle]]. The disease is the most common cause of [[cardiac arrest|sudden death]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Thomas AC, Knapman PA, Krikler DM, Davies MJ |title=Community study of the causes of &quot;natural&quot; sudden death |journal=BMJ |volume=297 |issue=6661 |pages=1453–6 |year=1988 |month=December |pmid=3147014 |pmc=1835183 |doi= 10.1136/bmj.297.6661.1453}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is also the most common reason for death of men and women over 20 years of age.&lt;ref name=AHA&gt;American Heart Association: [http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=3000090 Heart Disease and Stroke Statistics]-2007 Update. AHA, Dallas, Texas, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
According to present trends in the United States, half of healthy 40-year-old males will develop CAD in the future, and one in three healthy 40-year-old women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Rosamond W, Flegal K, Friday G |title=Heart disease and stroke statistics--2007 update: a report from the American Heart Association Statistics Committee and Stroke Statistics Subcommittee |journal=Circulation |volume=115 |issue=5 |pages=e69–171 |year=2007 |month=February |pmid=17194875 |doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.106.179918 |url=http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/115/5/e69/TBL3179728}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Guinness Book of Records]], [[Northern Ireland]] is the country with the most occurrences of CAD. By contrast, the [[Maasai people|Maasai]] of Africa have almost no heart disease.

As the degree of coronary artery disease progresses, there may be near-complete obstruction of the [[lumen (anatomy)|lumen]] of the coronary artery, severely restricting the flow of oxygen-carrying blood to the myocardium.  Individuals with this degree of coronary artery disease typically have suffered from one or more [[myocardial infarction]]s (heart attacks), and may have signs and symptoms of chronic coronary [[ischemia]], including symptoms of [[Angina pectoris|angina]] at rest and flash [[pulmonary edema]].

A distinction should be made between myocardial ischemia and myocardial infarction.  Ischemia means that the amount of blood supplied to the tissue is inadequate to supply the needs of the tissue.  When the myocardium becomes ischemic, it does not function optimally.  When large areas of the myocardium becomes ischemic, there can be impairment in the relaxation and contraction of the myocardium.  If the blood flow to the tissue is improved, myocardial ischemia can be reversed.  Infarction means that the tissue has undergone irreversible death due to lack of sufficient oxygen-rich blood.

An individual may develop a rupture of an atheromatous plaque at ''any'' stage of the spectrum of coronary artery disease. The acute rupture of a plaque may lead to an acute [[myocardial infarction]] (heart attack).

==Pathophysiology==
Limitation of blood flow to the heart causes [[ischemia]] (cell starvation secondary to a lack of oxygen) of the myocardial cells.  Myocardial cells may die from lack of [[oxygen]] and this is called a [[myocardial infarction]] (commonly called a heart attack). It leads to [[cardiac muscle|heart muscle]] damage, [[cardiac muscle|heart muscle]] death and later [[myocardial scarring]] without [[cardiac muscle|heart muscle]] regrowth. Chronic high-grade stenosis of the coronary arteries can induce transient ischemia which leads to the induction of a ventricular arrhythmia, which may terminate into ventricular fibrillation leading to death.

CAD is associated with [[Tobacco smoking|smoking]], [[diabetes]], and [[hypertension]].   A family history of early CAD is one of the less important predictors of CAD.  Most of the familial association of coronary artery disease are related to common dietary habits. Screening for CAD includes evaluating [[High density lipoprotein|high-density]] and [[Low density lipoprotein|low-density lipoprotein]] ([[cholesterol]]) levels and [[triglyceride]] levels.  Despite much press, most of the alternative risk factors including homocysteine, C-reactive protein (CRP), Lipoprotein (a), coronary calcium and more sophisticated lipid analysis have added little if any additional value to the conventional risk factors of smoking, diabetes and hypertension.

==Angina==
[[Angina pectoris|Angina]] (chest pain) that occurs regularly with activity, after heavy meals, or at other predictable times is termed stable angina and is associated with high grade [[stenosis|narrowings]] of the [[heart]] [[artery|arteries]].  The symptoms of angina are often treated with betablocker therapy such as metoprolol or atenolol.  Nitrate preparations such as [[Glyceryl trinitrate (pharmacology)|nitroglycerin]], which come in short-acting and long-acting forms are also effective in relieving symptoms but are not known to reduce the chances of future heart attacks. Many other more effective treatments, especially of the underlying [[atheroma]]tous disease, have been developed.

Angina that changes in intensity, character or frequency is termed unstable. Unstable angina may precede myocardial infarction, and requires urgent medical attention. It may be treated with oxygen, intravenous nitroglycerin, and aspirin. Interventional procedures such as [[angioplasty]] may be done.

== Characteristics of coronary artery disease ==
=== Special Pathophysiology ===
Typically, coronary artery disease occurs when part of the smooth, elastic lining inside a [[coronary artery]] (the arteries that supply blood to the heart muscle) develops [[atherosclerosis]]. With atherosclerosis, the artery's lining becomes hardened, stiffened, and swollen with all sorts of &quot;grunge&quot; - including calcium deposits, fatty deposits, and abnormal inflammatory [[Cell (biology)|cells]] - to form a [[Atheromatous plaque|plaque]]. Deposits of calcium phosphates (hydroxyapatites) in the muscular layer of the blood vessels appear to play not only a significant role in stiffening arteries but also for the induction of an early phase of coronary [[arteriosclerosis]].  This can be seen in a so-called metatstatic mechanism of calcification as it occurs in chronic kidney disease and haemodialysis  (Rainer Liedtke 2008). Although these patients suffer from a kidney dysfunction, almost fifty percent of them die due to coronary artery disease. Plaques can be thought of as large &quot;pimples&quot; that protrude into the channel of an artery, causing a partial obstruction to blood flow. Patients with coronary artery disease might have just one or two [[Atheromatous plaque|plaque]]s, or might have dozens distributed throughout their [[coronary arteries]]. However, there is a term in medicine called ''“'''Cardiac Syndrome X'''”'', which describes chest pain ([[Angina pectoris]]) and chest discomfort in people who do not show signs of blockages in the larger [[coronary arteries]] of their hearts when an [[angiogram]] (coronary angiogram) is being performed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lanza GA |title=Cardiac syndrome X: a critical overview and future perspectives |journal=Heart |volume=93 |issue=2 |pages=159–66 |year=2007 |month=February |pmid=16399854 |doi=10.1136/hrt.2005.067330 |url= |pmc=1861371}}&lt;/ref&gt;

No one knows exactly what causes “Cardiac Syndrome X” and it is unlikely to have a single cause. Today, we speculate that the major contributing factor to “Cardiac Syndrome X” is ''“'''microvascular dysfunction'''”''.{{Who|date=March 2009}} The term “microvascular” refers to very small blood vessels and, in this case, very small [[arteries]] ([[arterioles]], [[capillaries]]) of the [[heart]]. Studies have also shown that people with “Cardiac Syndrome X” have enhanced [[pain]] perception, meaning they feel chest pain more intensely than the average person.

The large majority of women have the garden variety of coronary artery disease.  Rarely, women with “Cardiac Syndrome X” have typical anginal syndromes that are not associated with the presence of atherosclerotic plaques; that is, the localized blockages are absent. Scientists speculate that the blood vessels in these women are diffuse abnormal. Some have falsely claim that the entire lining of the [[artery]] becomes thickened throughout, making the [[Atheromatous plaque|plaque]]s flush with the wall of the [[artery]] without any scientific proof.  On [[cardiac catheterization]] their [[coronary arteries]] appear smooth-walled and normal, though they may look &quot;small&quot; in diameter. By the way: in general, female [[coronary arteries]] (like all arteries) are somewhat smaller than in males.[[Image:Coro Man.jpg|thumb|Coronary angiogram of a man]][[Image:Coro Woman.jpg|thumb|Coronary angiogram of a woman]]

“Cardiac Syndrome X” have never been shown to cause acute heart attacks ([[myocardial infarction]]) despite much speculation. The prognosis with syndrome-X coronary artery disease is also known to be better than with typical coronary artery disease, but this is not a benign condition since it can be quite disabling. 
It is not completely clear why women are more likely than men to suffer from &quot;Syndrome X&quot;; however, [[hormone]]s and other risk factors unique to women may play a role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kaski JC |title=Pathophysiology and management of patients with chest pain and normal coronary arteriograms (cardiac syndrome X) |journal=Circulation |volume=109 |issue=5 |pages=568–72 |year=2004 |month=February |pmid=14769677 |doi=10.1161/01.CIR.0000116601.58103.62 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women’s blood vessels are exposed to changing levels of [[oestrogen]] throughout their lives, first during regular menstrual cycles and later during and after [[menopause]] as [[oestrogen]] levels decline with age. [[Oestrogen]] affects how blood vessels narrow and widen and how they respond to injury, so changes in [[oestrogen]] levels mean changes in the reactivity of the blood vessels. Women’s vessels may be “programmed” for more changes than men’s vessels, which could increase the risk of having problems in the lining of the [[arteries]] ([[endothelial cells]]) and the [[smooth muscle]] cells in the walls of the arteries.
The endothelial dysfunction is likely to be multifactorial in these patients and it is conceivable that risk factors such as [[hypertension]], [[hypercholesterolemia]], [[diabetes mellitus]] and smoking can contribute to its development. Most patients with Syndrome X are postmenopausal women and [[oestrogen]] deficiency has been therefore proposed as a pathogenic factor in female patients. In addition to changing hormone levels, there are several other risk conditions for blood vessel problems that are unique to women, such as [[preeclampsia]] (a problem associated with high blood pressure during pregnancy) and delivering a low-birth weight baby.  Of course, despite these issues women, the female gender as a whole is protective against coronary artery disease.

=== Symptoms ===
Cardiac Syndrome X often is a diagnosis of exclusion where the presence of '''typical''' chest pains is not accompanied by coronary artery narrowings on angiography. In considering Syndrome-X, it is important to understand that about 80% of chest pains have nothing to do with the heart.  Therefore, the characteristics of typical chest pains must be carefully documented to avoid unnecessary labelling patients with heart disease:

* Chest pain or [[Angina pectoris]] with physical stress; the [[pain]] may spread to the left arm or the neck, back, throat, or jaw. There might be present a numbness ([[paresthesia]]) or a loss of feeling in the arms, shoulders, or wrists
* [[Coronary angiography]] demonstrates “normal” coronary arteries, i.e. no blockages or stenoses can be detected in the larger [[epicardial]] vessels
* No inducible coronary artery [[spasm]] present during [[cardiac catheterization]]
* Characteristic [[ischemic]] [[ECG]] changes during exercise testing
* [[ST segment]] depression and angina in the presence of left ventricular wall perfusion abnormalities during thallium or other stress perfusion test
* Consistent response to sublingual [[nitrate]]s.
* Postmenopausal or [[Menopause|menopausal]] status

The diagnosis of “Cardiac Syndrome X” - the rare coronary artery disease that is more common in women, as mentioned, an “exclusion” diagnosis. Therefore, usually the same tests are used as in any patient with the suspicion of coronary artery disease:
* [[Baseline (medicine)|Baseline]] [[electrocardiography]] (ECG)
* Exercise ECG – [[Cardiac stress test|Stress test]]
* Exercise radioisotope test (nuclear stress test, myocardial [[scintigraphy]])
* [[Echocardiography]] (including stress echocardiography)
* [[Coronary angiography]]
* [[Intravascular ultrasound]]
* [[Magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI)

===Therapy===
A variety of drugs are used in the attempt to treat the Syndrome-X coronary artery disease: [[nitrate]]s, [[calcium channel antagonist]]s, [[ACE-inhibitor]]s, [[statin]]s, [[imipramine]] (for [[analgesia]]), [[aminophylline]], hormone replacement therapy ([[oestrogen]]), even electrical [[spinal cord stimulation]] are tried to overcome the symptomatology -all with mixed results. Quite often the quality of life for these women remains poor.

While not enough is known about Syndrome-X coronary artery disease to list specific [[Preventive medicine|prevention]] techniques, adopting heart-healthy habits can be a good start.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} These include monitoring [[cholesterol]] and [[blood pressure]] levels{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}, maintaining a low-fat [[Diet (nutrition)|diet]]{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}, exercising regularly{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}, quitting smoking, avoiding recreational drugs{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}, and moderating alcohol intake.

'''Risk factors can be classified as'''
#Fixed: age, sex, family history
#Modifiable: smoking, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, obesity, etc.

There are various risk assessment systems for determining the risk of coronary artery disease, with various emphasis on different variables above. A notable example is ''Framingham Score'', used in the [[Framingham Heart Study]]. It is mainly based on age, gender, diabetes, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, tobacco smoking and systolic blood pressure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.framinghamheartstudy.org/risk/coronary.html framinghamheartstudy.org &gt; Coronary Heart Disease (10-year risk)] (based on Wilson, D'Agostino, Levy et al. 'Prediction of Coronary Heart Disease using Risk Factor Categories', Circulation 1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prevention ==
Coronary artery disease is the most common form of heart disease in the Western world. Prevention centers on the modifiable risk factors, which include decreasing [[cholesterol]] levels, addressing [[obesity]] and [[hypertension]], avoiding a [[sedentary lifestyle]], making healthy dietary choices, and [[smoking cessation|stopping smoking]]. There is some evidence that lowering [[homocysteine]] levels may contribute to more heart attacks (NORVIT trial). In [[diabetes mellitus]], there is little evidence that very tight [[blood sugar]] control actually improves cardiac risk although improved sugar control appears to decrease other undesirable problems like kidney failure and blindness. Some recommend a diet rich in omega-3 fatty acids and [[vitamin C]]. The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) recommends &quot;low to moderate alcohol intake&quot; to reduce risk of coronary artery disease although this remains without scientific cause and effect proof.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/nutrition/topics/5_population_nutrient/en/index12.html |title=5. Population nutrient intake goals for preventing diet-related chronic diseases |publisher=WHO |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An increasingly growing number of other [[physiological]] markers and [[homeostatic]] mechanisms are currently under scientific investigation.  Patients with CAD and those trying to prevent CAD are advised to avoid fats that are readily oxidized (e.g., saturated fats and [[trans-fats]]), limit carbohydrates and processed sugars to reduce production of [[Low density lipoprotein]]s (LDLs), [[triacylglycerol]] and apolipoprotein-B.

It is also important to keep [[blood pressure]] normal, exercise and stop smoking.  These measures reduces the development of heart attacks.  Recent studies have shown that dramatic reduction in LDL levels can cause regression of coronary artery disease in as many as 2/3 of patients after just one year of sustained treatment.

Menaquinone ([[Vitamin K|Vitamin K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]), but not phylloquinone ([[Vitamin K|Vitamin K&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;]]), intake is associated with reduced risk of CAD [[Death|mortality]], all-cause mortality and severe aortic calcification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Geleijnse JM, Vermeer C, Grobbee DE |title=Dietary intake of menaquinone is associated with a reduced risk of coronary artery disease: the Rotterdam Study |journal=J.

CAD has always been a tough disease to diagnose without the use of invasive or stressful activities.  The development of the Multifunction Cardiogram (MCG) has changed the way CAD is diagnosed.  The MCG consists of a 2 lead resting EKG signal is transformed into a mathematical model and compared against tens of thousands of clinical trials to diagnose a patient with an objective severity score, as well as secondary and tertiary results about the patients condition.  The results from MCG tests have been validated in 8 clinical trials which resulted in a database of over 50,000 patients where the system has demonstrated accuracy comparable to [[coronary angiography]] (90% overall sensitivity, 85% specificity).
This level of accuracy comes from the application of advanced techniques in signal processing and systems analysis combined with a large scale clinical database which allows MCG to provide quantitative, evidence-based results to assist physicians in reaching a diagnosis.  The MCG has also been awarded a Category III CPT code by the [[American Medical Association]] in the July 2009 CPT update.

==Exercise==
Separate to the question of the benefits of exercise; it is unclear whether doctors should spend time counseling patients to exercise. The [http://www.ahrq.gov/clinic/uspstfix.htm U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF)], based on a [[systematic review]] of [[randomized controlled trials]], found 'insufficient evidence' to recommend that doctors counsel patients on exercise, but &quot;it did not review the evidence for the effectiveness of physical activity to reduce chronic disease, morbidity and mortality&quot;, it only examined the effectiveness of the counseling itself.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12160370&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author= |title=Behavioral counseling in primary care to promote physical activity: recommendation and rationale |journal=Ann.

[[Omega 3|Omega-3]] fatty acids are also found in some plant sources including [[flax seed oil]], [[hemp seed oil]], and [[walnut]]s. The plant omega-3 (ALA) is biologically inferior to marine omega-3, as ALA needs to be converted in the liver to EPA, but only about five per cent is converted.

== Secondary prevention ==
Secondary prevention is preventing further sequelae of already established disease. Regarding coronary artery disease, this can mean risk factor management that is carried out during cardiac rehabilitation, a 4-phase process beginning in hospital after MI, angioplasty or heart surgery and continuing for a minimum of three months. Exercise is a main component of cardiac rehabilitation along with diet, smoking cessation, and blood pressure and cholesterol management. Beta blockers may also be used for this purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Awtry |first=Eric H. |coauthors=Joseph Loscalzo |title=Cecil Essentials of Medicine |pages=87–108 |chapter=Coronary Heart Disease |year=2004 |edition=6 |publisher=Saunders |location=Philadelphia, PA |isbn=978-0-7216-0147-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anti-platelet therapy===
A [[meta-analysis]] of [[randomized controlled trials]] by the international [[Cochrane Collaboration]] found &quot;that the use of clopidogrel plus aspirin is associated with a reduction in the risk of cardiovascular events compared with aspirin alone in patients with acute non-ST coronary syndrome. In patients at high risk of cardiovascular disease but not presenting acutely, there is only weak evidence of benefit and hazards of treatment almost match any benefit obtained.&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17636787&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Keller T, Squizzato A, Middeldorp S |title=Clopidogrel plus aspirin versus aspirin alone for preventing cardiovascular disease |journal=Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online) |volume= |issue=3 |pages=CD005158 |year=2007 |pmid=17636787 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD005158.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*1. Medical treatment - drugs (e.g. cholesterol lowering medications, beta-blockers, nitroglycerin, calcium antagonists, etc.);
*2. Coronary interventions as [[angioplasty]] and [[coronary stent]]-implantation;
*3. Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG - [[coronary artery bypass surgery]]).
Recent research efforts focus on new angiogenic treatment modalities ([[angiogenesis]]) and various (adult) [[stem cell]] therapies.

The metal is extremely reactive and [[pyrophoricity|pyrophoric]], reacting with water even at {{convert|−116|°C}}. It is the least [[electronegativity|electronegative]] element that has stable isotopes, of which it has only one, caesium-133. Caesium is mined mostly from [[pollucite]], while the [[Radionuclide|radioisotopes]], especially [[caesium-137]], are extracted from waste produced by [[nuclear reactor technology|nuclear reactors]].

Two German chemists, [[Robert Bunsen]] and [[Gustav Kirchhoff]], discovered caesium in 1860 by the newly developed method of [[Atomic_emission_spectroscopy#Flame_emission_spectroscopy|flame spectroscopy]]. The first small-scale applications for caesium have been as a &quot;[[getter]]&quot; in [[vacuum tube]]s and in [[Solar cell|photoelectric cells]]. In 1967, a specific frequency from the [[emission spectrum]] of caesium-133 was chosen to be used in the definition of the [[second]] by the [[International System of Units]]. Since then, caesium has been widely used in [[atomic clock]]s.

Since the 1990s, the largest application of the element has been as caesium formate for [[drilling fluid]]s. It has a range of applications in the production of electricity, in electronics, and in chemistry. The radioactive isotope caesium-137 has a [[half-life]] of about 30 years and is used in medical applications, industrial gauges, and hydrology. Although the element is only mildly toxic, it is a hazardous material as a metal and its radioisotopes present a high health risk in case of radiation leaks.

=== Chemical properties ===
[[File:Cesium water.theora.ogv|left|thumb|Addition of a small amount of caesium to cold water is explosive.|alt=A person adds a small amount of metal to a petri dish with cold water which produces a small explosion.]]
Caesium metal is highly reactive and very [[pyrophoricity|pyrophoric]]. In addition to igniting spontaneously in air, it reacts explosively with water even at low temperatures, more so than other members of the [[Alkali metal|first group]] of the [[periodic table]].&lt;ref name=&quot;USGS&quot; /&gt; The reaction with solid water occurs at temperatures as low as {{convert|−116|°C}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt; Because of its high reactivity, the metal is classified as a [[hazardous material]]. It is stored and shipped in dry saturated hydrocarbons such as [[mineral oil]]. Similarly, it must be handled under [[inert gas|inert atmosphere]] such as [[argon]] or [[nitrogen]]. It can be stored in vacuum-sealed [[borosilicate glass]] [[ampoule]]s. In quantities of more than about 100&amp;nbsp;[[gram]]s (3.5&amp;nbsp;[[ounce|oz]]), caesium is shipped in hermetically sealed stainless steel containers.&lt;ref name=&quot;USGS&quot; /&gt;

The chemistry of caesium is similar to that of other alkali metals, but is more closely similar to that of [[rubidium]], the element above caesium in the periodic table.&lt;ref name=&quot;greenwood&quot; /&gt; Some small differences arise from the fact that it has a higher [[atomic mass]] and is more electropositive than other (non-radioactive) alkali metals.&lt;ref name=&quot;HollemanAF&quot;&gt;{{cite book|publisher = Walter de Gruyter|year = 1985|edition = 91–100|pages = 953–955|isbn = 3-11-007511-3|title = Lehrbuch der Anorganischen Chemie|first1 = Arnold F.|last1 = Holleman|last2 = Wiberg|first2 = Egon |last3 =Wiberg|first3 = Nils|chapter = Vergleichende Übersicht über die Gruppe der Alkalimetalle| language = German}}&lt;/ref&gt; Caesium is the most [[electronegativity|electropositive]] stable chemical element.{{#tag:ref|[[Francium]] may be more electropositive, but this has not been experimentally measured due to its high radioactivity. Measurements of the first [[ionization energy]] of francium suggest that [[relativistic quantum chemistry|relativistic effects]] may lower its reactivity and raise its electronegativity above that expected from [[periodic trend]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Andreev|first1 = S.

The grey spheres represent the caesium atoms. The center of each small cube is occupied by a small green sphere representing a chlorine atom. Thus, every chlorine is in the middle of a cube formed by caesium atoms and every caesium is in the middle of a cube formed by chlorine.]]

The vast majority of caesium compounds contain the element as the [[cation]] {{chem|Cs||+}}, which [[ionic bond|binds ionically]] to a wide variety of [[anion]]s. One noteworthy exception is provided by the [[alkalide|caeside]] anion ({{chem|Cs||−}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal = [[Angewandte Chemie|Angewandte Chemie International Edition]]|year = 1979|first = J. L.|last = Dye|title = Compounds of Alkali Metal Anions|volume = 18|issue = 8|pages = 587–598|doi = 10.1002/anie.197905871}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other exceptions include the several suboxides (see section on oxides below).

Returning to more normal compounds, salts of Cs&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; are almost invariably colorless unless the anion itself is colored.  Many of the simple salts are [[hygroscopic]], but less so than the corresponding salts of the lighter alkali metals.  The [[acetate]], [[carbonate]], [[halide]]s, [[oxide]], [[nitrate]], and [[sulfate]] salts are water-soluble. [[Double salt]]s are often less soluble, and the low solubility of caesium aluminium sulfate is exploited in the purification of Cs from its ores.

==== Complexes ====
Like all metal cations, Cs&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; forms complexes with [[Lewis base]]s in solution.  Because of its large size, Cs&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; usually adopts [[coordination number]]s greater than six-coordination, which is typical for the lighter alkali metal cations.  This trend is already apparent by the 8-coordination in CsCl, vs the halite motif adopted by the other alkali metal chlorides. Its high coordination number and [[HSAB|softness]] (tendency to form covalent bonds) are the basis of the separation of Cs&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; from other cations, as is practiced in the remediation of nuclear wastes, where &lt;sup&gt;137&lt;/sup&gt;Cs&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is separated from large amounts of non-radioactive K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Moyer |first1=Bruce A. |last2=Birdwell |first2=Joseph F. |last3=Bonnesen |first3=Peter V. |last4=Delmau |first4=Laetitia H. |title=Use of Macrocycles in Nuclear-Waste Cleanup: A Realworld Application of a Calixcrown in Cesium Separation Technology |pages=383–405 |year=2005 |doi=10.1007/1-4020-3687-6_24}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Halides ====
[[Caesium chloride]] (CsCl) crystallizes in the simple [[cubic crystal system]].  Also called the &quot;caesium chloride structure&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;HollemanAF&quot; /&gt; this structural motif is composed of a [[primitive cell|primitive]] cubic lattice with a two-atom basis, each with an eightfold [[coordination number|coordination]]; the chloride atoms lie upon the lattice points at the edges of the cube, while the caesium atoms lie in the holes in the center of the cubes. This structure is shared with [[caesium bromide|CsBr]] and [[caesium iodide|CsI]], and many other compounds that do not contain Cs. In contrast, most other alkaline halides adopt the [[sodium chloride]] (NaCl) structure.&lt;ref name=&quot;HollemanAF&quot; /&gt; The CsCl structure is preferred because Cs&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; has an [[ionic radius]] of 174&amp;nbsp;[[picometer|pm]] and {{chem|Cl||−}} 181&amp;nbsp;pm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wells|first = A.F.| year=1984| title=Structural Inorganic Chemistry| edition=5|publisher=Oxford Science Publications|isbn=0-19-855370-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Caesium has a total of 39 known [[isotope]]s that range in their [[mass number]] (i.e. number of [[nucleon]]s in its nucleus) from 112 to 151.

The radioactive [[caesium-135|&lt;sup&gt;135&lt;/sup&gt;Cs]] has a very long half-life of about 2.3&amp;nbsp;million years, while [[caesium-137|&lt;sup&gt;137&lt;/sup&gt;Cs]] and [[caesium-134|&lt;sup&gt;134&lt;/sup&gt;Cs]] have half-lives of 30 and 2&amp;nbsp;years, respectively. &lt;sup&gt;137&lt;/sup&gt;Cs decomposes to a short-lived [[barium-137m|&lt;sup&gt;137m&lt;/sup&gt;Ba]] by [[beta decay]], and then to non-radioactive barium, while &lt;sup&gt;134&lt;/sup&gt;Cs transforms into &lt;sup&gt;134&lt;/sup&gt;Ba directly.

== Production ==
The mining of pollucite ore is a selective process and is conducted on a small scale in comparison with most metal mining operations. The ore is crushed, hand-sorted, but not usually concentrated, and then ground. Caesium is then extracted from pollucite mainly by three methods: acid digestion, alkaline decomposition, and direct reduction.&lt;ref name=&quot;USGS&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=Burt&gt;{{cite book|last = Burt|first = R. O.|year = 1993|chapter = Caesium and cesium compounds|title = Kirk-Othmer encyclopedia of chemical technology|edition = 4th|place = New York|publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|volume = 5|pages = 749–764|isbn = 978-0-471-48494-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the acid digestion, the [[silicate]] pollucite rock is dissolved with strong acids such as [[hydrochloric acid|hydrochloric]] (HCl), [[sulfuric acid|sulfuric]] ({{chem|H|2|SO|4}}), [[hydrobromic acid|hydrobromic]] (HBr), or [[hydrofluoric acid|hydrofluoric]] (HF). With hydrochloric acid, a mixture of soluble chlorides is produced, and the insoluble chloride double salts of caesium are precipitated as caesium antimony chloride ({{chem|Cs|4|SbCl|7}}), caesium iodine chloride ({{chem|Cs|2|ICl}}), or caesium hexachlorocerate ({{chem|Cs|2|(CeCl|6|)}}). After separation, the pure precipitated double salt is decomposed, and pure CsCl is obtained after evaporating the water. The method using sulfuric acid yields the insoluble double salt directly as caesium [[alum]] ({{chem|CsAl(SO|4|)|2|&amp;middot;12H|2|O}}). The [[aluminium sulfate]] in it is converted to the insoluble [[aluminium oxide]] by roasting the alum with [[carbon]], and the resulting product is [[leaching (metallurgy)|leached]] with water to yield a {{chem|Cs|2|SO|4}} solution.&lt;ref name=&quot;USGS&quot; /&gt;

The roasting of pollucite with [[calcium carbonate]] and [[calcium chloride]] yields insoluble calcium silicates and soluble caesium chloride. Leaching with water or dilute [[ammonia]] ({{chem|NH|4|OH}}) yields then a dilute chloride (CsCl) solution. This solution can be evaporated to produce caesium chloride or transformed into caesium alum or caesium carbonate. Albeit not commercially feasible, direct reduction of the ore with potassium, sodium or calcium in vacuum can produce caesium metal directly.&lt;ref name=&quot;USGS&quot; /&gt;

Most of the mined caesium (as salts) is directly converted into [[formate|caesium formate]] (HCOO&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;Cs&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) for applications such as [[oil drilling]]. To supply the developing market, [[Cabot Corporation]] built a production plant in 1997 at the Tanco Mine near Bernic Lake in Manitoba, Canada, with a capacity of 12,000 [[barrel (volume)|barrels]] per year of caesium formate solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Benton|first1 = William|last2 = Turner| first2 = Jim|year = 2000|title = Cesium formate fluid succeeds in North Sea HPHT field trials|journal = Drilling Contractor|issue = May/June|pages = 38–41|url = http://www.iadc.org/dcpi/dc-mayjun00/m-cabot.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2010-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary smaller-scale commercial compounds of caesium are [[caesium chloride]] and its [[Caesium nitrate|nitrate]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CEC&quot; /&gt;

Alternatively, caesium metal may be obtained from the purified compounds derived from the ore. Caesium chloride, and the other caesium halides as well, can be reduced at {{convert|700|to|800|°C|°F}} with calcium or [[barium]], followed by distillation of the caesium metal. In the same way, the aluminate, carbonate, or hydroxide may be reduced by [[magnesium]].&lt;ref name=&quot;USGS&quot; /&gt; The metal can also be isolated by [[electrolysis]] of fused caesium [[cyanide]] (CsCN).

== History ==
[[File:Kirchhoff Bunsen Roscoe.jpg|thumb|[[Gustav Kirchhoff]] (left) and [[Robert Bunsen]] (center) discovered caesium spectroscopically.| alt= Three middle-aged men, with the one in the middle sitting down. All wear long jackets, and the shorter man on the left has a beard.]]
In 1860, [[Robert Bunsen]] and [[Gustav Kirchhoff]] discovered caesium in the [[mineral water]] from [[Bad Dürkheim|Dürkheim]], [[Germany]]. Due to the bright blue lines in its [[emission spectrum]], they chose a name derived from the Latin word ''caesius'', meaning sky-blue.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Bunsen quotes [[Aulus Gellius]] [[Aulus Gellius|Noctes Atticae]] II, 26 by [[Nigidius Figulus]]: ''Nostris autem veteribus caesia dicts est quae Graecis, ut Nigidus ait, de colore coeli quasi coelia.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]], 2nd Edition&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BuKi1861&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Weeks&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title = The discovery of the elements.

To obtain a pure sample of caesium, {{convert|44,000|liters}} of mineral water had to be evaporated to yield {{convert|240|kg}} of concentrated salt solution. The [[alkaline earth metal]]s were precipitated either as sulfates or [[oxalate]]s, leaving the alkali metal in the solution. After conversion to the [[nitrate]]s and extraction with [[ethanol]], a sodium-free mixture was obtained. From this mixture, the lithium was precipitated by [[ammonium carbonate]]. Potassium, rubidium and caesium form insoluble salts with [[chloroplatinic acid]], but these salts show a slight difference in solubility in hot water. Therefore, the less-soluble caesium and rubidium hexachloroplatinate ((Cs,Rb)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PtCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) could be obtained by [[fractional crystallization (chemistry)|fractional crystallization]]. After reduction of the hexachloroplatinate with [[hydrogen]], caesium and rubidium could be separated by the difference in solubility of their carbonates in alcohol. The process yielded {{convert|9.2|g}} of [[rubidium chloride]] and {{convert|7.3|g}} of caesium chloride from the initial 44,000&amp;nbsp;liters of mineral water.&lt;ref name=&quot;BuKi1861&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title = Chemische Analyse durch Spectralbeobachtungen |pages = 337–381 |first1 = G.|last1 = Kirchhoff |first2 = R.|last2 = Bunsen|authorlink1 = Gustav Kirchhoff|authorlink2 = Robert Bunsen|doi = 10.1002/andp.18611890702 |journal = [[Annalen der Physik|Annalen der Physik und Chemie]] |volume = 189 |issue = 7|year = 1861|bibcode = 1861AnP...189..337K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two scientists used the caesium chloride thus obtained to estimate the [[atomic weight]] of the new element at 123.35 (compared to the currently accepted one of 132.9).&lt;ref name=&quot;BuKi1861&quot; /&gt; They tried to generate elemental caesium by electrolysis of molten caesium chloride, but instead of a metal, they obtained a blue homogenous substance which &quot;neither under the naked eye nor under the microscope&quot; showed the slightest trace of metallic substance;&quot; as a result, they assigned it as a [[Non-stoichiometric compound|subchloride]] ({{chem|Cs|2|Cl}}). In reality, the product was probably a [[colloid]]al mixture of the metal and caesium chloride.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zsigmondy|first=Richard |title=Colloids and the Ultra Microscope|publisher=Read books|year=2007|isbn=978-1-4067-5938-9|page=69|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Ac2mGhqjgUkC&amp;pg=PAPA69#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=2010-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The electrolysis of the aqueous solution of chloride with a mercury anode produced a caesium amalgam which readily decomposed under the aqueous conditions.&lt;ref name=&quot;BuKi1861&quot; /&gt; The pure metal was eventually isolated by the German chemist [[Carl Setterberg]] while working on his doctorate with [[Friedrich August Kekulé von Stradonitz|Kekule]] and Bunsen.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weeks&quot; /&gt; In 1882 he produced caesium metal by electrolyzing [[caesium cyanide]], and thus avoiding the problems with the chloride.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sett&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title =Ueber die Darstellung von Rubidium- und Cäsiumverbindungen und über die Gewinnung der Metalle selbst|doi =10.1002/jlac.18822110105 |year =1882 |last1 =Setterberg |first1 =Carl |journal =Justus Liebig's Annalen der Chemie |volume =211 |pages =100–116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, the most important use for caesium has been in research and development, primarily in chemical and electrical fields. Very few applications existed for caesium until the 1920s when it became used in radio [[vacuum tube]]s. It had two functions: as a [[getter]] it removed excess oxygen after manufacture, and as a coating on the heated [[cathode]], it increased its [[electrical conductivity]]. Caesium did not become recognized as a high-performance industrial metal until the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Strod|first = A.J.|year = 1957|title = Cesium—A new industrial metal|journal = American Ceramic Bulletin|volume = 36|issue = 6| pages = 212–213}}&lt;/ref&gt; Applications of non-radioactive caesium included [[Solar cell|photoelectric cells]], [[photomultiplier]] tubes, optical components of [[infrared spectroscopy|infrared spectrophotometers]], catalysts for several organic reactions, crystals for [[scintillation counter]]s, and in [[MHD generator|magnetohydrodynamic power generators]].&lt;ref name=&quot;USGS&quot; /&gt;

Since 1967, the [[International System of Units|International System of Measurements]] has based its unit of [[time]], the [[second]], on the properties of caesium. The International System of Units (SI) defines the second as 9,192,631,770 cycles of the [[Radioactive decay|radiation]], which corresponds to the transition between two [[hyperfine structure|hyperfine]] [[energy level]]s of the [[ground state]] of the caesium-133 [[atom]].&lt;ref name=USNO&gt;{{cite web|title = Cesium Atoms at Work|publisher=Time Service Department—U.S. Naval Observatory—Department of the Navy|url = http://tycho.usno.navy.mil/cesium.html|accessdate = 2009-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 13th General Conference on Weights and Measures of 1967 defined a second as: &quot;the duration of 9,192,631,770 cycles of microwave light absorbed or emitted by the hyperfine transition of caesium-133 atoms in their ground state undisturbed by external fields&quot;.

== Applications ==
=== Petroleum exploration ===
The largest current end-use of caesium is in [[formate|caesium formate]]-based [[drilling fluid]]s for the extractive oil industry.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} Aqueous solutions of caesium formate (HCOO&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;Cs&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;)—made by reacting caesium hydroxide with [[formic acid]]—were developed in the mid-1990s for use as oil well drilling and [[completion (oil and gas wells)|completion fluids]]. The function of caesium formate as a drilling fluid is to lubricate drill bits, to bring rock cuttings to the surface, and to maintain pressure on the formation during drilling of the well; as completion fluid (which refers to the emplacement of control hardware after drilling but prior to production) is to maintain the pressure.&lt;ref name=&quot;USGS&quot; /&gt;

The high density of the caesium formate brine (up to 2.3&amp;nbsp;g·cm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;, or 19.2&amp;nbsp;pounds per gallon),&lt;ref name=&quot;Down&quot;&gt;{{cite conference|conference= IADC/SPE Drilling Conference |month= February|year= 2006|location = Miami, Florida, USASociety of Petroleum Engineers|first1 = J.

Unlike the components of many other heavy liquids, caesium formate is relatively environment-friendly.&lt;ref name=&quot;Down&quot; /&gt; The caesium formate brine can be blended with potassium and sodium formates to decrease the density of the fluids down to that of water (1.0&amp;nbsp;g·cm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;, or 8.3&amp;nbsp;pounds per gallon). Furthermore, it is biodegradable and reclaimable, and may be recycled, which is important in view of its high cost (about $4,000&amp;nbsp;per [[Barrel (volume)#Oil barrel|barrel]] in 2001).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Flatern|first = Rick|year = 2001|title = Keeping cool in the HPHT environment|journal = Offshore Engineer|issue = February|pages = 33–37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alkali formates are safe to handle and do not damage the producing formation or downhole metals as their corrosive alternative, high-density brines (such as [[zinc bromide]] {{Chem|ZnBr|2}} solutions),sometimes do; they also require less cleanup and disposal costs.&lt;ref name=&quot;USGS&quot; /&gt;

=== Atomic clocks ===
[[File:Usno-mc.jpg|thumb|250px|Atomic clock ensemble at the U.S. Naval Observatory|alt= A room with a black box in the foreground and six control cabinets with space for five to six racks each. Most, but not all, of the cabinets are filled with white boxes.]]
[[File:FOCS-1.jpg|thumb|FOCS-1, a continuous cold caesium fountain atomic clock in Switzerland, started operating in 2004 at an uncertainty of one second in 30 million years|alt= A laboratory table with some optical devices on it.]]
Caesium-based [[atomic clock]]s observe [[Electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic transitions]] in the [[hyperfine structure]] of caesium-133 atoms and use it as a reference point. The first accurate caesium clock was built by [[Louis Essen]] in 1955 at the [[National Physical Laboratory, UK|National Physical Laboratory]] in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first1=L.|last=Essen|first2=J.V.L.|last2=Parry |year=1955 |title=An Atomic Standard of Frequency and Time Interval: A Caesium Resonator |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=176 |pages=280 |doi=10.1038/176280a0|bibcode = 1955Natur.176..280E |issue=4476}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, they have been improved repeatedly over the past half-century, and form the basis for standards-compliant time and frequency measurements. These clocks measure frequency with an accuracy of 2 to 3&amp;nbsp;parts in 10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;, which would correspond to a time measurement accuracy of 2&amp;nbsp;[[nanosecond]]s per day, or one second in 1.4&amp;nbsp;million&amp;nbsp;years. The latest versions are accurate to better than 1 part in 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;, which means they would be off by about 2 seconds since the [[Cretaceous–Tertiary extinction event|extinction of the dinosaurs]] 65&amp;nbsp;million years ago,&lt;ref name=&quot;USGS&quot; /&gt; and has been regarded as &quot;the most accurate realization of a unit that mankind has yet achieved.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;USNO&quot; /&gt;

Caesium clocks are also used in networks that oversee the timing of cell phone transmissions and the information flow on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first = Monte|last = Reel|date =2003-06-22|title = Where timing truly is everything|newspaper = Washington Post|page = B1|url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A25431-2003Jul21|accessdate = 2010-01-26 | date=2003-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Electric power and electronics ===
Caesium vapor [[thermionic converter|thermionic generators]] are low-power devices that convert heat energy to electrical energy. In the two-electrode [[vacuum tube]] converter, it neutralizes the space charge that builds up near the cathode, and in doing so, it enhances the current flow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1 = Rasor| first1 = Ned S.| first2 = Charles|last2 =Warner| title = Correlation of Emission Processes for Adsorbed Alkali Films on Metal Surfaces| journal = Journal of Applied Physics| volume = 35| issue = 9| pages = 2589–2600| date = September 1964|doi = 10.1063/1.1713806|bibcode = 1964JAP....35.2589R }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Caesium is also important for its [[Photoelectric effect|photoemissive]] properties by which light energy is converted to electron flow. It is used in [[Solar cell|photoelectric cells]] because caesium-based cathodes such as the intermetallic compound {{chem|K|2|CsSb}} have low threshold voltage for emission of [[electron]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanelements.com/cs.html |title=Cesium Supplier &amp; Technical Information |publisher=American Elements |accessdate=2010-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The range of photoemissive devices using caesium include [[optical character recognition]] devices, [[photomultiplier|photomultiplier tubes]], and [[video camera tube]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1063/1.3215593|title = K &lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CsSb Cathode Development| journal = American Institute of Physics Conference Proceedings |year = 2009|volume = 1149| pages = 1062–1066 | first1 =John|last1 = Smedley| first2 =Triveni|last2 = Rao| first3 =Erdong|last3 = Wang |last4=Crabb |first4=Donald G. |last5=Prok |first5=Yelena |last6=Poelker |first6=Matt |last7=Liuti |first7=Simonetta |last8=Day |first8=Donal B. |last9=Zheng |first9=Xiaochao}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first = P.|last = Görlich|title = Über zusammengesetzte, durchsichtige Photokathoden|journal = Zeitschrift für Physik|volume = 101|pages = 335–342|year =1936|doi =10.1007/BF01342330|bibcode = 1936ZPhy..101..335G|issue = 5–6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, [[germanium]], rubidium, selenium, silicon, tellurium, and several other elements can substitute caesium in photosensitive materials.&lt;ref name=&quot;USGS&quot; /&gt;

[[Caesium iodide]] (CsI), [[caesium bromide|bromide]] (CsBr) and caesium fluoride (CsF) crystals are employed for [[scintillator]]s in [[scintillation counter]]s widely used in mineral exploration and particle physics research as they are well suited for the detection of [[gamma ray|gamma]] and [[x-ray]] radiation. Caesium, being a heavy element, provides good stopping power contributing to better detectivity. Caesium compounds may also provide a faster response (CsF) and be less hygroscopic (CsI).

Caesium vapor is used in many common [[magnetometer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.1007/s00340-005-1773-x|title = Comparison of discharge lamp and laser pumped cesium magnetometers|year = 2005|last1 = Groeger|first1 = S.|first2 = A.

=== Centrifugation fluids ===
Because of their high density, solutions of [[caesium chloride]] (CsCl), [[caesium sulfate|sulfate]] ({{chem|Cs|2|SO|4}}), and [[trifluoroacetic acid|trifluoroacetate]] ({{chem|Cs(O|2|CCF|3|)}}) are commonly used in molecular biology for density gradient [[Differential centrifugation|ultracentrifugation]].&lt;ref&gt;Manfred Bick, Horst Prinz, &quot;Cesium and Cesium Compounds&quot; in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2005, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a06 153}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  This technology is primarily applied to the isolation of [[virus|viral particles]], sub-cellular [[organelle]]s and fractions, and [[nucleic acid]]s from biological samples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url = http://books.google.com/?id=1kn89nI2gUsC&amp;pg=PA61|pages = 61–62|isbn = 978-0-89603-564-5|chapter = Gradient Materials|editor =Desai, Mohamed A.|year = 2000|publisher = Humana Press|location = Totowa, N.J.|title = Downstream processing methods|accessdate=2010-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nuclear and isotope applications ===
[[Caesium-137]] is a very common [[Radionuclide|radioisotope]] used as a [[gamma ray|gamma]]-emitter in industrial applications. Its advantages include a half-life of roughly 30 years, its availability from the [[nuclear fuel cycle]], and having [[Isotopes of barium|&lt;sup&gt;137&lt;/sup&gt;Ba]] as stable end product.

Isotope 137 has also been used in [[hydrology|hydrologic]] studies analogous to those using [[tritium]]. It is produced from detonation of [[nuclear weapon]]s and emissions from nuclear power plants. With the commencement of nuclear testing around 1945, and continuing through the mid-1980s, caesium-137 was released into the atmosphere where it is absorbed readily into solution. Known year-to-year variation within that period allows correlation with soil and sediment layers. Caesium-134, and to a lesser extent caesium-135, have also been used in hydrology as a measure of caesium output by the nuclear power industry. While they are less prevalent than either caesium-133 or caesium-137, these isotopes have the advantage of being produced solely from anthropogenic sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Carol|last=Kendall |url=http://wwwrcamnl.wr.usgs.gov/isoig/period/cs_iig.html |title=Isotope Tracers Project – Resources on Isotopes – Cesium|publisher=National Research Program – U.S. Geological Survey |accessdate=2010-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--http://books.google.com/books?id=pWDQnxd-r1UC&amp;pg=PT360 &amp;pg=PT12 --&gt;

Caesium and mercury were used as a propellant in early [[ion thruster|ion engines]] designed for [[spacecraft propulsion]] on very long interplanetary or extraplanetary missions. The ionization method was to strip the outer electron from the propellant upon contact with a [[tungsten]] electrode that had [[voltage]] applied.

Caesium metal is one of the most reactive elements and is highly [[explosive material|explosive]] when it comes in contact with [[water]]. The hydrogen gas produced by the reaction is heated by the thermal energy released at the same time, causing ignition and a violent explosion. This can occur with other alkali metals, but caesium is so potent that this explosive reaction can even be triggered by cold water.&lt;ref name=&quot;USGS&quot; /&gt; The metal is highly [[pyrophoricity|pyrophoric]], and ignites spontaneously in air to form [[caesium hydroxide]] and various oxides.

The [[isotope]]s [[Caesium-134|134]] and 137 (present in the [[biosphere]] in small amounts from [[radiation leak]]s) represent a radioactivity burden which varies depending on location. Radiocaesium does not accumulate in the body as effectively as many other fission products (such as radioiodine and radiostrontium). As with other alkali metals, radiocaesium washes out of the body relatively quickly in sweat and urine. However, radiocaesium follows potassium and tends to accumulate in plant tissues, including fruits and vegetables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.1007/BF01376226|title = Accumulation of Cs and K and growth of bean plants in nutrient solution and soils|year = 1962|last1 = Nishita|first1 = H.|last2 = Dixon|first2 = D.|last3 = Larson|first3 = K.

A '''century''' (from the [[Latin]] ''centum'', meaning ''one hundred'') is [[one hundred]] consecutive [[year]]s. Centuries are numbered [[names of numbers in English#Ordinal numbers|ordinally]] in English and many other languages (e.g. &quot;the 7th century AD/CE&quot;).

==Start and end in the Gregorian Calendar==
According to the [[Gregorian calendar]], the 1st century AD/CE started on January 1, 1 and ended on December 31, 100. The 2nd century started at year [[101]], the 3rd at [[201]], etc. The ''n''-th century started/will start on the year ''(100×n)-99'' and ends in ''100×n'' . A century will only include one year, the centennial year, that starts with the century's number (e.g. '''19'''00 is the final year in the 19th century).

===1st century BC and AD===
There is no &quot;zeroth century&quot; in between the 1st century BC and the 1st century AD. Also, there is no [[Year zero|year 0 AD]].&lt;ref&gt;Two separate systems that also do not use religious titles, the [[Astronomical year numbering|astronomical system]] and the [[ISO 8601]] standard do use a [[year zero]]. The year 1 BC (identical to the year 1 BC) is represented as 0 in the astronomical system, and as 0000 in ISO 8601. Presently, ISO 8601 dating requires usage of the Gregorian calendar for all dates, however, whereas astronomical dating and Common Era dating allow usage of the Julian calendar for dates before 1582 AD.&lt;/ref&gt; The Julian calendar &quot;jumps&quot; from 1 BC to 1 AD. The first century BC includes the years [[100 BC]] to [[1 BC]]. Other centuries BC follow the same pattern.

==Dating units in other calendar systems==
Besides the Gregorian calendar, the [[Julian calendar]] and the [[Hindu calendar]] have cycles of years which are used to delineate whole time periods; the Hindu calendar, in particular, summarizes its years into groups of 60.

==Centuries in astronomical year numbering==
[[Astronomical year numbering]], used by [[astronomers]], includes a year zero (0). Consequently, the 1st century in these calendars may designate the years 0 to 99 as the 1st century, years 100 to 199 as the second etc. However, in order to regard 2000 as the first year of the 21st century according to the astronomical year numbering, the astronomical year 0 has to correspond to the Gregorian year 1 BC.

==Alternative naming systems==
In [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] and [[Finnish language|Finnish]], centuries are typically not named ordinally, but according to the hundreds part of the year, and consequently centuries start at even multiples of 100. For example, Swedish ''nittonhundratalet'' (or ''1900-talet''), Danish and Norwegian ''nittenhundredetallet'' (or '' 1900-tallet'') and Finnish ''tuhatyhdeksänsataaluku'' (or ''1900-luku'') refer unambiguously to the years 1900–1999. The same system is used informally in English. For example, the years 1900–1999 are sometimes referred to as the ''nineteen hundreds'' (''1900s''). This is similar to the English decade names (''1980s'', meaning the years 1980–1989).

'''Cardiff''' ({{IPAc-en|Cardiff.ogg|icon|ˈ|k|ɑː|d|ɪ|f}}; {{lang-cy|{{Audio-nohelp|Caerdydd.ogg|''Caerdydd''}}}}) is the [[capital city|capital]], largest city and most populous county of [[Wales]]. The city is Wales' chief commercial centre, the base for most national cultural and sporting institutions, the Welsh national media, and the seat of the [[National Assembly for Wales]]. According to recent estimates, the population of the [[unitary authority area]] is 336,200,&lt;ref name=&quot;2009 population&quot;/&gt; while the wider metropolitan area has a population of over 1.4 million, almost half of the total Welsh population.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cardiff Council ONS&quot;&gt;http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;cd=5&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CC0QFjAE&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cardiff.gov.uk%2Fobjview.asp%3Fobject_ID%3D9648&amp;rct=j&amp;q=cardiff%20population%202011&amp;ei=G1GaTajRBJGyhAe7-8X4CA&amp;usg=AFQjCNFsK3kjiRow0swo3WGKuB4Yx4n8IA&lt;/ref&gt; Cardiff is a significant tourism centre and the most popular visitor destination in Wales with 14.6&amp;nbsp;million visitors in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|location=Cardiff |first= Sally |last=Williams |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/cardiffonline/cardiff-news/2010/07/07/city-s-new-look-pulls-in-foreign-tourists-91466-26799475/| title=City’s new look pulls in foreign tourists  |newspaper= [[South Wales Echo]]|publisher=[[Media Wales|Media Wales Ltd]] |date= 7&amp;nbsp;July&amp;nbsp;2010 |accessdate=26&amp;nbsp;August&amp;nbsp;2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city of Cardiff is the [[county town]] of the [[Historic counties of Wales|historic county]] of [[Glamorgan]] (and later [[South Glamorgan]]). Cardiff is part of the [[Eurocities]] network of the largest European cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurocities.org/|title=Eurocities|accessdate=2008-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Cardiff Urban Area]] covers a slightly larger area outside of the county boundary, and includes the towns of [[Dinas Powys]], [[Penarth]] and [[Radyr]]. A small town until the early 19th century, its prominence as a [[port|major port]] for the transport of coal following the arrival of industry in the region contributed to its rise as a major city.

Cardiff was made a [[City status in the United Kingdom|city]] in 1905, and proclaimed [[capital of Wales]] in 1955. Since the 1990s Cardiff has seen significant development with a new waterfront area at [[Cardiff Bay]] which contains the [[Senedd]] building, home to the [[National Assembly for Wales|Welsh Assembly]] and the [[Wales Millennium Centre]] arts complex. Current developments include the continuation of the redevelopment of the Cardiff Bay and City Centre areas with projects such as the International Sports Village, a BBC drama village,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Proposed BBC Drama Village at Media Capital, Roath Basin|url=http://wales.gov.uk/publications/accessinfo/drnewhomepage/economicdrs/2010/bbcdramavillage/?lang=en|publisher=Welsh Assembly Government|accessdate=6 April 2011|date=14 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a new business district in the city centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cardiff Business District 'needs skills and transport'|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-east-wales-12905961|publisher=BBC Wales|accessdate=6 April 2011|date=30 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cardiff is the largest media centre in the U.K. outside of London. 

Sporting venues in the city include the [[Millennium Stadium]] (the national stadium for the [[Wales national rugby union team]] and the [[Wales national football team]]), [[SWALEC Stadium]] (the home of [[Glamorgan County Cricket Club]]), [[Cardiff City Stadium]] (the home of [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City football team]] and [[Cardiff Blues|Cardiff Blues rugby union team]]), [[Cardiff International Sports Stadium]] (the home of [[Cardiff Amateur Athletic Club]]) and [[Cardiff Arms Park]] (the home of [[Cardiff RFC|Cardiff Rugby Club]]). The city is also HQ of the [[Wales Rally GB]] and was awarded with the European City Of Sport in 2009 due to its role in hosting major international sporting events. It has been announced that Cardiff will once again be the European City of Sport in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=City takes European sports capital title for 2014|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/cardiffonline/cardiff-news/2011/04/01/city-takes-european-sports-capital-title-for-2014-91466-28440348/|accessdate=6 April 2011|newspaper=South Wales Echo|date=1 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Millennium Stadium will also host 11 football matches as part of the [[2012 Summer Olympics]], including the games' opening event and the men's bronze medal match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Olympic football in Cardiff|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-east-wales-12905961|publisher=Visit Cardiff|accessdate=6 April 2011|date=2011-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
[[File:Cardiff Castle (Roman wall).jpg|thumb|left|The front wall of [[Cardiff Castle]], showing part of the original Roman fort from which the city may have derived its name.]]
''Caerdydd'' (the [[Welsh language|Welsh]] name of the city), and its [[Anglicisation|anglicised]] form Cardiff, derive from [[Sub-Roman Britain|post-Roman]] [[Brythonic languages|Brythonic]] words meaning &quot;the fort on the [[River Taff|Taff]]&quot;. The [[Cardiff Roman Fort|fort]] refers to that established by the [[Roman Britain|Romans]]. &quot;Dydd&quot; or &quot;Diff&quot; are both modifications of &quot;Taff&quot;, the river on which [[Cardiff Castle]] stands, with the ''T'' [[lenition|mutating]] to ''D'' in Welsh. According to Professor Hywel Wyn Owen, a leading modern authority on [[toponymy]], the Welsh pronunciation of &quot;Caerdyff&quot; as &quot;Caerdydd&quot; shows the colloquial [[alternation (linguistics)|alternation]] of Welsh ''&quot;-f&quot;'' and ''&quot;-dd&quot;''.&lt;ref name=hwo&gt;Hywel Wyn Owen, ''The Place-names of Wales'', 1998, ISBN 0-7083-1458-9&lt;/ref&gt;

The antiquarian [[William Camden]] (1551–1623) suggested that the name Cardiff may derive from the name &quot;Caer-Didi&quot; (&quot;the Fort of Didius&quot;), given in honour of [[Aulus Didius Gallus]], governor of a nearby province at the time when the Roman fort was established. Although some websites repeat this theory as fact, it is disputed by modern scholars on linguistic grounds, with Professor Gwynedd Pierce of [[Cardiff University]] recently describing it as ''&quot;rubbish&quot;''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/whatsinaname/sites/videoexplorer/pages/?jumpTo=cardiff|title=What's In A Name? – Cardiff|last=Pierce|first=Prof Gwynedd O.|publisher=BBC Wales|accessdate=2008-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[archaeology|Archaeological]] evidence from sites in and around Cardiff—the [[St Lythans burial chamber]], near [[Wenvoe]] (about four miles (6.4&amp;nbsp;km) west, south west of Cardiff City Centre), the [[Tinkinswood|Tinkinswood burial chamber]], near [[St Nicholas]] (about six miles (10&amp;nbsp;km) west of Cardiff City Centre), the Cae'rarfau [[Chambered tomb|Chambered Tomb]], [[Creigiau]] (about six miles (10&amp;nbsp;km) north west of Cardiff City Centre) and the Gwern y Cleppa Long Barrow, near [[Coedkernew]], [[Newport]] (about eight and a quarter miles (13.5&amp;nbsp;km) north east of Cardiff City Centre)—shows that [[Neolithic]] people had settled in the area by at least around 6,000&amp;nbsp;[[Before Present|BP (Before Present]]), about 1,500 years before either [[Stonehenge]] or the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]] was completed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coflein St L&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=St Lythans Chambered Long Cairn, Maesyfelin; Gwal-y-Filiast, site details|url=http://www.coflein.gov.uk/en/site/227289/details/ST+LYTHANS+CHAMBERED+LONG+CAIRN%2C+MAESYFELIN%3B+GWAL-Y-FILIAST/|accessdate=2009-06-09|publisher=Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales|date=2007-07-26|work=The Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales website}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Coflein Tink&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=TINKINSWOOD CHAMBERED CAIRN, site details|url=http://www.coflein.gov.uk/en/site/94510/details/TINKINSWOOD+CHAMBERED+CAIRN/|accessdate=2009-06-09|publisher=Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales|date=2003-01-29|work=The Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales website}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Coflein Cae&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=CAE-YR-ARFAU; CAE'RARFAU BURIAL CHAMBER, site details, Coflein|url=http://www.coflein.gov.uk/en/site/93016/details/CAE-YR-ARFAU%3B+CAE%27RARFAU+BURIAL+CHAMBER/

Until the [[Roman conquest of Britain]], Cardiff was part of the territory of the [[Silures]] – a [[Iron Age tribes in Britain|Celtic British tribe]] that flourished in the [[Iron Age]] – whose territory included the areas that would become known as [[Breconshire]], [[Monmouthshire (historic)|Monmouthshire]] and [[Glamorgan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Wales Hist 1&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Davies|first=John|authorlink=John Davies (historian)|title=A History of Wales|publisher=Penguin|year=1994|location=London|pages=17&amp;nbsp;18|isbn=0-14-01-4581-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The {{convert|3.2|ha|acre|0|adj=on}} [[Cardiff Roman Fort|fort]] established by the [[Roman army|Romans]] near the mouth of the [[River Taff]] in 75&amp;nbsp;[[Common Era|CE (Common Era)]], in what would become the north western boundary of the centre of Cardiff, was built over an extensive settlement that had been established by the Silures in the 50s&amp;nbsp;CE.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coflein 2&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fort was one of a series of military outposts associated with ''[[Isca Augusta]]'' ([[Caerleon]]) that acted as border defences. The fort may have been abandoned in the early 2nd century as the area had been subdued, however by this time a civilian settlement, or ''[[Vicus (Rome)|vicus]]'', was established. It was likely made up of traders who made a living from the fort, ex-soldiers and their families. A [[Roman villa]] has been discovered at [[Ely, Cardiff|Ely]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Little is known about the fort and civilian settlement in the period between the Roman departure from Britain and the Norman Conquest. Historian William Rees suggests that the settlement probably shrank in size and may even have been abandoned. In the absence of Roman rule, Wales was divided into small kingdoms; early on, [[Meurig ap Tewdrig]] emerged as the local king in [[Glywysing]] (which later became Glamorgan). The area passed through his family until the advent of the Normans in the 11th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

A small town grew up in the shadow of the castle, made up primarily of settlers from England.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cardiffians&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cardiffians.co.uk/timeline.html|publisher=Cardiffians|title=Cardiff Timeline|accessdate=2008-02-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cardiff had a population of between 1,500 and 2,000 in the Middle Ages, a relatively normal size for a Welsh town in this period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tim Lambert-short history of Cardiff&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.localhistories.org/Cardiff.html|publisher=Tim Lambert|title=A short history of Cardiff|accessdate=2008-02-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the 13th century, Cardiff was the only town in Wales with a population exceeding 2,000, but it was relatively small compared with most notable towns in the [[Kingdom of England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.helsinki.fi/iehc2006/papers3/Campbell122.pdf|title=Benchmarking medieval economic development: England, Wales, Scotland, and Ireland, circa 1290|first=Bruce M S|last=Campbell|date=2006-08-25|accessdate=2008-05-20|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 12th century a wooden palisade was erected around the city to protect it.

In 1404 [[Owain Glyndŵr]] burned Cardiff and took Cardiff Castle.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bob Sanders-period up to 1699&quot;/&gt; As the town was still very small, most of the buildings were made of wood and the town was destroyed.

===County town of Glamorganshire===
In 1536, the [[Laws in Wales Acts 1535–1542|Act of Union]] between England and Wales led to the creation of the [[shire]] of Glamorgan, and Cardiff was made the [[county town]].

===Building of the docks===
[[File:Cardiff Docks.jpg|thumb|[[Tiger Bay|Cardiff Docks]]—from where coal was shipped throughout the world]]
In 1793, [[John Crichton-Stuart, 2nd Marquess of Bute]] was born. He would spend his life building the Cardiff docks and would later be called &quot;the creator of modern Cardiff&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cardiffians&quot;/&gt; A twice-weekly boat service between Cardiff and [[Bristol]] was established in 1815,&lt;ref name=&quot;Bob Sanders 2&quot;/&gt; and in 1821, the Cardiff Gas Works was established.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bob Sanders 2&quot;/&gt;

After the Napoleonic Wars Cardiff entered a period of social and industrial unrest, starting with the trial and hanging of [[Dic Penderyn]] in 1831.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

The town grew rapidly from the 1830s onwards, when the [[John Crichton-Stuart, 2nd Marquess of Bute|Marquess of Bute]] built a [[dock (maritime)|dock]] which eventually linked to the [[Taff Vale Railway]]. Cardiff became the main port for exports of coal from the [[Cynon Valley|Cynon]], [[Rhondda]], and [[Rhymney Valley|Rhymney]] valleys, and grew at a rate of nearly 80% per decade between 1840 and 1870. Much of the growth was due to [[human migration|migration]] from within and outside Wales: in 1841, a quarter of Cardiff's population were English-born and more than 10% had been born in Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Leary|first=Paul|title=Irish Migrants in Modern Wales|publisher=Liverpool University Press|year=2004|page=14|isbn=9780853238584|url=http://books.google.com/?id=qkCmYNMVMxwC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA14,M1|accessdate=2008-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1881 census, Cardiff had overtaken both Merthyr and Swansea to become the largest town in Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=Francis Michael Longstreth|title=The Cambridge Social History of Britain, 1750–1950|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=311|isbn=9780521438162|year=1993|url=http://books.google.com/?id=eozO2RzSAVUC&amp;pg=PA311&amp;lpg=PA311}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cardiff's new status as the premier town in South Wales was confirmed when it was chosen as the site of the [[University of Wales|University College South Wales and Monmouthshire]] in 1893.&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyclopedia of Wales&quot;/&gt;

Cardiff faced a challenge in the 1880s when [[David Davies (industrialist)|David Davies of Llandinam]] and the [[Barry Railway Company]] promoted the development of rival docks at [[Barry, Vale of Glamorgan|Barry]]. Barry docks had the advantage of being accessible in all [[tide]]s, and David Davies claimed that his venture would cause &quot;grass to grow in the streets of Cardiff&quot;. From 1901 coal exports from Barry surpassed those from Cardiff, but the administration of the coal trade remained centred on Cardiff, in particular its [[Coal Exchange]], where the price of coal on the British market was determined and the first million-pound deal was struck in 1907.&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyclopedia of Wales&quot;/&gt; The city also strengthened its industrial base with the decision of the owners of the [[Dowlais Ironworks]] in Merthyr (who would later form part of [[GKN|Guest, Keen and Nettlefolds]]) to build a new [[steel mill|steelworks]] close to the docks at East Moors, which was opened on 4 February 1891 by [[John Crichton-Stuart, 3rd Marquess of Bute|Lord Bute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archivesnetworkwales.info/cgi-bin/anw/fulldesc_nofr?inst_id=33&amp;coll_id=77663&amp;expand=|title=East Moors Steelworks, Cardiff collection (record of information achival)|date=2006-02-01|publisher=Glamorgan Records Office|accessdate=2008-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===City and capital city status===
[[File:Welsh National War Memorial, Cathays Park.jpg|thumb|Welsh National War Memorial, Cathays Park]]
[[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VII]] granted Cardiff [[City status in the United Kingdom|city status]] on 28 October 1905,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Beckett|first=J.V.|title=City Status in the British Isles, 1830–2002|publisher=Ashgate Publishing Ltd|year=2005|page=2|isbn=9780754650676|url=http://books.google.com/?id=jqqSSOyjBEoC&amp;pg=PP8&amp;lpg=PP1|accessdate=2008-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the city acquired a [[Roman Catholic]] [[Cathedral]] in 1916. In subsequent years an increasing number of national institutions were located in the city, including the [[National Museum Cardiff|National Museum of Wales]], [[Welsh National War Memorial]], and the [[University of Wales]] Registry Building—however, it was denied the [[National Library of Wales]], partly because the library's founder, Sir John Williams, considered Cardiff to have &quot;a non-Welsh population&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyclopedia of Wales&quot;/&gt;

After a brief post-war boom, Cardiff docks entered a prolonged decline in the [[interwar period]]. By 1936, their trade was less than half its value in 1913, reflecting the slump in demand for [[South Wales coalfield|Welsh coal]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyclopedia of Wales&quot;/&gt; Bomb damage during the [[Cardiff Blitz]] in [[World War II]] included the devastation of [[Llandaff Cathedral]], and in the immediate postwar years the city's link with the Bute family came to an end.

The city was proclaimed [[capital (political)|capital]] city of Wales on 20 December 1955, by a written reply by the [[Home Secretary]] [[Gwilym Lloyd George, 1st Viscount Tenby|Gwilym Lloyd George]]. [[Caernarfon]] had also vied for this title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cardiff as Capital of Wales: Formal Recognition by Government|publisher=The Times|date=1955-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cardiff therefore celebrated two important [[anniversary|anniversaries]] in 2005. The Encyclopedia of Wales notes that the decision to recognise the city as the capital of Wales &quot;had more to do with the fact that it contained marginal [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] constituencies than any reasoned view of what functions a Welsh capital should have&quot;. Although the city hosted the [[Commonwealth Games]] in 1958, Cardiff only became a centre of national administration with the establishment of the [[Welsh Office]] in 1964, which later prompted the creation of various other public bodies such as the [[Arts Council of Wales]] and the [[Welsh Development Agency]], most of which were based in Cardiff.

In the 1997 [[devolution]] [[referendum]], Cardiff voters rejected the establishment of the [[National Assembly for Wales]] by 55.4% to 44.2% on a 47% turnout, which Denis Balsom partly ascribed to a general preference in Cardiff and some other parts of Wales for a [[British people|'British']] rather than exclusively [[Welsh people|'Welsh']] [[national identity|identity]].&lt;ref&gt;Balsom, Denis.

The city was [[county town]] of [[Glamorgan]] until the council reorganisation in 1974 paired Cardiff and the now [[Vale of Glamorgan]] together as the new county of [[South Glamorgan]]. Further local government restructuring in 1996 resulted in Cardiff city's [[Districts of Wales|district]] council becoming a [[unitary authority]], the [[Cardiff Council|City and County of Cardiff]], with the addition of [[Creigiau]] and [[Pentyrch]].[[File:Cardiff city hall pano.jpg|thumb|centre|550px|Cathays Park, Cardiff, with [[City Hall, Cardiff|Cardiff City Hall]] (left) and the [[National Museum Cardiff|National Museum Gallery of Wales]] (right)]]

==Geography==
{{main|Geography of Cardiff}}
The centre of Cardiff is relatively flat and is bounded by hills on the outskirts to the east, north and west. Its geographic features were influential in its development as the world's largest coal port, most notably its proximity and easy access to the coal fields of the south Wales valleys. 

Cardiff is built on reclaimed marshland on a bed of [[Triassic]] stones; this reclaimed marshland stretches from [[Chepstow]] to the Ely Estuary,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cardiff.gov.uk/ObjView.asp?Object_ID=7004|title=Cardiff Supplementary Planning Guidance: Archaeologically Sensitive Areas|date=2006-07-20|publisher=Cardiff County Council|accessdate=2008-10-01|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is the natural boundary of Cardiff and the Vale of Glamorgan. Triassic landscapes of this part of the world are usually shallow and low-lying which accounts and explains the flatness of the centre of Cardiff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2008|title=Discussion on palaeoecology of the Late Triassic extinction event in the SW UK|journal=Journal of the Geological Society|publisher=Geological Society of London|volume=165|issue=5|pages=988–992|url=http://jgs.lyellcollection.org/cgi/content/full/165/5/988|accessdate=2008-10-01|doi=10.1144/0016-76492008-014|last1=Radley|first1=J. D.|last2=Twitchett|first2=R. J.|last3=Mander|first3=L.|last4=Cope|first4=J.C.W}}&lt;/ref&gt; The classic Triassic [[marl]], [[sand]] and [[conglomerate (geology)|conglomerate]] rocks are used predominantly throughout Cardiff as building materials. Many of these Triassic rocks have a purple complexion, especially the coastal [[marl]] found near Penarth. One of the Triassic rocks used in Cardiff is &quot;Radyr Stone&quot;, a [[freestone (masonry)|freestone]] which as it name suggests is quarried in the Radyr district.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.englishstone.org.uk/documents/dimension%20stone%208.html|title=Triassic building sandstone resources|accessdate=2008-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cardiff has also imported some materials for buildings: [[Devonian]] sandstones (the [[Old Red Sandstone]]) from the [[Brecon Beacons]] has been used. Most famously, the buildings of [[Cathays Park]], the civic centre in the centre of the city, are built of [[Portland stone]] which was imported from Dorset.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swga.org.uk/pdf/CathaysPark.pdf|format=PDF|title=Geological Walks in Wales: Cathays Park|publisher=Geologists Association South Wales|accessdate=2008-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; A widely used building stone in Cardiff is the yellow-grey [[Early Jurassic|Liassic]] [[limestone]] rock of the [[Vale of Glamorgan]], including the very rare &quot;Sutton Stone&quot;, a conglomerate of lias limestone and [[carboniferous]] limestone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.castlewales.com/morgraig.html|title=Castell Morgraig|last=Iowerth|first=Dylan|publisher=Castle Studies Group|year=1998|accessdate=2008-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cardiff is bordered to the west by the rural district of the [[Vale of Glamorgan]]—also known as The Garden of Cardiff—&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gardenofcardiff.com/|title=The Garden of Cardiff|accessdate=2008-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the east by the city of [[Newport]], to the north by the [[South Wales Valleys]] and to the south by the [[River Severn|Severn Estuary]] and [[Bristol Channel]]. The [[River Taff]] winds through the centre of the city and together with the [[River Ely]] flows into the freshwater lake of [[Cardiff Bay]]. A third river, the [[Rhymney River|Rhymney]] flows through the east of the city entering directly into the Severn Estuary.

Cardiff is situated near the [[Glamorgan]] [[Heritage Coast]], stretching westward from Penarth and Barry—commuter towns of Cardiff—with striped yellow-blue Jurassic limestone cliffs. The Glamorgan coast is the only part of the [[Celtic Sea]] that has exposed [[Jurassic]] ([[blue lias]]) geology. This stretch of coast, which has reefs, sandbanks and serrated cliffs, was a [[ship graveyard]]; ships sailing up to Cardiff during the industrial era often never made it as far as Cardiff as many were wrecked around this hostile coastline during west/south-westerly gales. Consequently, smuggling, deliberate shipwrecking and attacks on ships were common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kenfig.org.uk/smuggling.html|title=Smuggling Around Kenfig|publisher=Kenfig.org|accessdate=2008-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;Inner Cardiff&quot; consists of the following wards: [[Penylan]], [[Plasnewydd]], [[Gabalfa]], [[Roath]], [[Cathays (electoral ward)|Cathays]], [[Adamsdown]] and [[Splott]] ward on the north and east of the city centre, and [[Butetown]], [[Grangetown, Cardiff|Grangetown]], [[Riverside, Cardiff|Riverside]] and [[Canton, Cardiff|Canton]] to the south and west.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cardifflife.net/cardiffwheretolive.html|title=Places to live in Cardiff|publisher=cardifflife.net|accessdate=2009-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inner-city areas to the south of the [[A4161 road]] (known as the &quot;Southern Arc&quot;) are, with the exception of Cardiff Bay, some of the poorest districts of Wales with low levels of economic activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|coauthors=Alan Hooper, John Punter|title=Capital Cardiff 1975–2020: Regeneration, Competitiveness and the Urban Environment|publisher=[[University of Wales Press]]|location=Cardiff|year=2006|page=63|isbn=0708320635|url=http://books.google.com/?id=Hvud9bNwTisC&amp;pg=PT81&amp;lpg=PT81&amp;dq=%22southern+arc%22+cardiff}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand Gabalfa, Plasnewydd and Cathays north of the 'arc' have very large student populations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/for/prospective/pg/life/accommodation/areasofcardiff/index.html|title=Areas of Cardiff|publisher=Cardiff University|accessdate=2008-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Pontcanna (situated north of Riverside and alongside Canton) is a favourite for students and young professionals. [[Penylan]], which lies to the north east side of Roath Park, is an affluent area popular with those with older children and the retired.

&quot;Suburban Cardiff&quot; can be broken down into three distinct areas. To the west lie [[Ely, Cardiff|Ely]], [[Caerau, Cardiff|Caerau]] and [[Fairwater, Cardiff|Fairwater]] which contain some of the largest housing estates in the United Kingdom. With the exception of some of the outlying privately built estates at Michaelston Super Ely and 1930s developments near Waun-Gron Road, this is an economically disadvantaged area with high numbers of unemployed households. [[Culverhouse Cross]] is a more affluent western area of the city. [[Radyr]], [[Llandaff]], [[Llandaff North]], [[Whitchurch, Cardiff|Whitchurch]] &amp; [[Tongwynlais]], [[Rhiwbina]], [[Heath, Cardiff|Heath]], [[Llanishen]], [[Thornhill, Cardiff|Thornhill]], [[Lisvane]] and [[Cyncoed]] which lie in an arc from the north west to the north east of the centre can be considered the main middle class suburbs of the city. In particular, Cyncoed, [[Radyr]] and Lisvane contain some of the most expensive housing in Wales. Further to the east lie the wards of Pontprennau &amp; Old St Mellons, Rumney, [[Pentwyn, Cardiff|Pentwyn]], [[Llanrumney]] and [[Trowbridge, Cardiff|Trowbridge]]. The latter three are again largely of public housing stock, although new private housing is being built in Trowbridge in considerable number. [[Pontprennau]] is the newest 'suburb' of Cardiff, whilst [[St Mellons|Old St Mellons]] has a history going back to the [[Norman Conquest]] in the 11th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldstmellons.co.uk/history/|title=Old St Mellons History|accessdate=2008-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To the north west of the city lies a region that may be called &quot;Rural Cardiff&quot; containing the villages of [[St. Fagans]], [[Creigiau]], [[Pentyrch]], [[Tongwynlais]] and [[Gwaelod-y-garth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cardiff.gov.uk/content.asp?nav=2870%2C3139%2C3158%2C3965&amp;parent_directory_id=2865|title=Landscape Study of Cardiff|date=2008-10-17|publisher=Cardiff County Council|accessdate=2008-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; St. Fagans, home to the [[Museum of Welsh Life]], is protected from further development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cardiff.gov.uk/ObjView.asp?Object_ID=9569|title=St Fagans Conservation Area Appraisal|year=2007|publisher=Cardiff County Council|accessdate=2008-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a period of decline during the 1970s and 1980s, Cardiff's population is growing. The local authority area had an estimated population of more than 336,200 in 2009,&lt;ref name=&quot;2009 population&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cardiff.gov.uk/objview.asp?object_ID=9648|format=PDF|title=Latest Official Population Estimate for Cardiff|publisher=Cardiff County Council|date=2009-07-01|accessdate=2011-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; compared to a [[United Kingdom Census 2001|2001 Census]] figure of 305,353.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadTableView.do?a=3&amp;b=276879&amp;c=Cardiff&amp;d=13&amp;e=16&amp;g=421924&amp;i=1001x1003x1004&amp;m=0&amp;r=1&amp;s=1204063245714&amp;enc=1&amp;dsFamilyId=75|title=Neighbourhood Statistics|publisher=Office for National Statistics|date=2001-04-01|accessdate=2008-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between mid-2007 and mid-2008, Cardiff was the fastest-growing local authority in Wales with population growth rate of 1.2%.&lt;ref name=&quot;2008 population&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wales.gov.uk/docs/statistics/2009/090827sb492009en.pdf?lang=en|format=PDF|title=2008 Mid-year Estimates of Population|publisher=National Office of Statistics for Wales|date=2009-08-27|accessdate=2009-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Census 2001 data, Cardiff was the 14th [[List of largest United Kingdom settlements by population|largest settlement]] in the [[United Kingdom]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statistics.gov.uk/downloads/census2001/ks_ua_ew_part1.pdf Key Statistics for urban areas in England and Wales], ''Census 2001''.

Official estimates derived from the census regarding the city's total population have been disputed. The city council has published two articles that argue the 2001 census seriously under reports the population of Cardiff and, in particular, the ethnic minority population of some inner city areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cardiff.gov.uk/ObjView.asp?Object_ID=3418&amp;Language=|title=Cardiff Council Representations to ONS on the 2001 Census: Section 1|format=PDF|accessdate=2007-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cardiff.gov.uk/ObjView.asp?Object_ID=3419&amp;Language=|title=Cardiff Council Representations to ONS on the 2001 Census: Section 2|format=PDF|accessdate=2007-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cardiff has a ethnically diverse population due to its past trading connections, post-war immigration and the large numbers of foreign students who attend university in the city. The ethnic make-up of Cardiff's population at the time of the 2001 census was: 91.6% white, 2% mixed race, 4% South Asian, 1.3% black, 1.2% other ethnic groups. According to a report published in 2005, over 30,000 people from an ethnic minority live in Cardiff, around 8.4% of the city's total – many of these communities live in [[Butetown]], where ethnic minorities make up around a third of the total population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cardiff.gov.uk/ObjView.asp?Object_ID=4997|format=PDF|title=Black and Minority Ethnic Communities Consultation Report, 2005|date=2005-09-01|accessdate=2008-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; This diversity, and especially that of the city's long-established African and Arab communities, has been celebrated in a number of cultural exhibitions and events, along with a number of books which have been published on this subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lee|first=Brian|title=Butetown and Cardiff Docks|publisher=The History Press|date=1999-04-15|isbn=978-0752415826}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bhac.org/black_history.html|title=Black History in Butetown|publisher=Butetown History &amp; Arts Centre|accessdate=2008-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Language===
{{See also|Cardiff dialect}}

Cardiff has a chequered linguistic history with [[Welsh language|Welsh]], [[English language|English]], [[Latin]], [[Old Norse|Norse]] and [[Norman-French]] preponderant at different times. Welsh was the majority language in Cardiff from the 13th century until the city's explosive growth in the [[Victorian era]].&lt;ref name=&quot;welsh&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Jenkins|first=H Geraint|title=The Welsh Language before the Industrial Revolution|location=Cardiff|year=1997|isbn=070831418X 9780708314180}}&lt;/ref&gt; As late as 1850, five of the 12 [[Anglican]] churches within the current city boundaries conducted their services exclusively in the [[Welsh language]], while only two worshipped exclusively in English.&lt;ref name=&quot;welsh&quot;/&gt; By 1891, the percentage of Welsh speakers had dropped to 27.9% and only [[Lisvane]], [[Llanedeyrn]] and [[Creigiau]] remained as majority Welsh-speaking communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Language and Community in the Nineteenth Century|first=Geraint H.|last=Jenkins|isbn=0-7083-1467-8|year=1998|publisher=Univ. of Wales Press|location=Cardiff}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Welsh language became grouped around a small cluster of chapels and churches, the most notable of which is Tabernacl in the city centre, one of four UK churches chosen to hold official services to commemorate the new millennium. Following the establishment of the city's first Welsh School (Ysgol Gymraeg Bryntaf) in the 1950s, Welsh has slowly regained some ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/2755217.stm|title=Census shows Welsh language rise|date=2003-02-14|publisher=BBC Wales|accessdate=2008-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aided by Welsh-medium education and migration from other parts of Wales, the number of Welsh speakers in Cardiff rose by 14,451 between 1991 and 2001; Welsh is now spoken by 11% of Cardiffians. The highest percentage of Welsh speakers is in [[Pentyrch]], where 15.9% of the population speak the language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bwrdd-yr-iaith.org.uk/download.php/pID=9986.6|format=PDF|title=Pentyrch Community Council Welsh Language Scheme|date=2003-06-01|accessdate=2008-01-22}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to English and Welsh, the diversity of Cardiff's population (including foreign students) means that a large number of languages are spoken within the city. One study has found that Cardiff has speakers of at least 94 languages, with [[Somali language|Somali]], [[Urdu]], [[Bengali language|Bangla]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]] being the most commonly spoken foreign languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cilt.org.uk/pdf/pubs/positively_plurilingual.pdf|title=Positively Plurilingual|format=PDF|accessdate=2008-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern [[Cardiff dialect|Cardiff accent]] is distinct from that of the nearby South Wales Valleys. It is marked primarily by:
*The substitution of &lt; iə &gt; by &lt;øː&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Phonetics&quot;&gt;[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tPwYt3gVbu4C&amp;pg=PA87&amp;lpg=PA87&amp;dq=cardiff+accent&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=G0VLcC5XKi&amp;sig=PQ-dMr1AN-fnS86oZt6fLqBb8bU&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=TMeOS_3BKI6A4Qaq6YitDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CA8Q6AEwBDgy#v=onepage&amp;q=cardiff%20accent&amp;f=false Google Books|The phonetics of Cardiff English]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cardiff accent&quot;&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/learning/langlit/sounds/text-only/wales/cardiff/ Accents and dialects of the UK: Cardiff ''Accessed 2 March 2010'']&lt;/ref&gt;

*The vowel of ''start'' may be realised as [æː] or even [ɛː], so that ''Cardiff'' is pronounced ['kæːdɪf]

====Language schools====
Due to its diversity, large student population, and convenient size and location, Cardiff has seen a rise in the number of people coming to the city to learn English. Foreign students are a common sight on the streets of Cardiff with a large percentage coming from Arabic and other European countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;2008 population&quot; /&gt; The [[British Council]] has an office in the city centre and there are six accredited schools in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishcouncil.org/accreditation-az-list.htm|title=A-Z list of accredited centres}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|History of the Jews in Wales}}
Since 1922 Cardiff has included the suburban cathedral 'village' of [[Llandaff]], whose bishop is also [[Archbishop of Wales]] since 2002. There is also a [[Cardiff Cathedral|Roman Catholic cathedral]] in the city. Since 1916 Cardiff has been the seat of a Catholic archbishop, but there appears to have been a fall in the estimated Catholic population, with estimated numbers in 2006 being around 25,000 less than in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/dcard.html#stats|title=Archdiocese of Cardiff – Statistics|accessdate=2008-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, the [[Jewish]] population of the city also appears to have fallen—there are two synagogues in Cardiff, one in Cyncoed and one in Moira Terrace, as opposed to seven at the turn of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishgen.org/jcr-uk/Community/Cardiff.htm|title=JCR-UK – Cardiff Community|date=2005-10-14|accessdate=2008-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are a significant number of [[nonconformism|nonconformist]] chapels, an early-20th century Greek Orthodox church and 11 mosques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genuki.org.uk/big/wal/GLA/Roath/Chapels.html|title=Cardiff, Llandaff &amp; Roath chapels database|accessdate=2008-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nostos.com/church/|title=The Greek Orthodox Church in Great Britain|accessdate=2008-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.muslimdirectory.co.uk/displayresults.php?PHPSESSID=f0fb8b41d8758983e7d43cddb556b9df&amp;businesstype=1&amp;orgtype=&amp;country=UK&amp;city=Cardiff|title=Muslim Directory – Mosques in Cardiff|accessdate=2008-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2001 census 66.9% of Cardiff's population described itself as Christian, a percentage point below the Welsh and UK averages.

In the 2001 census Cardiff's Muslim population stood at 3.7%, above the [[Islam in the UK|UK average (2.7%)]] and significantly above the [[Islam in Wales|Welsh average]].

[[File:Cardiffsynagogue.jpeg|left|thumb|The former Cardiff Synagogue, Cathedral Road—now an office block.]]
The oldest of the non-Christian communities in Wales is Judaism. Jews were not permitted to live in Wales between the 1290 [[Edict of Expulsion]]—given by [[Edward I of England]]—and the 17th century. A Welsh Jewish community was re-established in the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/religion/sites/timeline/pages/religion_in_wales_15.shtml|title=Multicultural Wales|accessdate=2007-12-06|publisher=British Broadcasting Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was once a fairly substantial [[Jewish]] population in South Wales, most of which has disappeared. The modern community is centered in the [[Cardiff United Synagogue]].

The proportion of Cardiff residents declaring themselves to be Hindu, Sikh and Jewish were all considerably higher than the Welsh averages, but less than the UK figures. The city has been home to a sizable Hindu community since Indian immigrants settled there during the 1950s and 1960s. The first Hindu temple in the city was opened in [[Grangetown, Cardiff|Grangetown]] on 6 April 1979 on the site of an abandoned printing press (which itself was the former site of a synagogue).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swaminarayanwales.org.uk/History/history.asp|title=History of Shree Swaminarayan Temple Cardiff|accessdate=2008-05-21| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080420155606/http://www.swaminarayanwales.org.uk/History/history.asp| archivedate = April 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 25th anniversary of the temple's founding was celebrated in September 2007 with a parade of over 3000 people through the city centre, including Hindus from across the United Kingdom and members of Cardiff's other religious communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/south_east/7006249.stm|title=Worshippers celebrate with parade|date=2007-09-22|publisher=BBC Wales|accessdate=2008-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, there are over 2000 Hindus in Cardiff, worshiping at three temples across the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;cityprofile&quot;/&gt;

Industry has played a major part in Cardiff's development for many centuries. The main catalyst for its transformation from a small town into a big city was the demand for coal required in making iron and later steel, brought to the sea by [[packhorse]] from [[Merthyr Tydfil]]. This was first achieved by the construction of a {{convert|25|mi|km|sing=on}} long canal from Merthyr (510 feet above sea-level) to the Taff Estuary at Cardiff.&lt;ref name=&quot;canal&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alangeorge.co.uk/the_glamorganshire_canal.htm|title=The Glamorganshire Canal|accessdate=2008-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually the [[Taff Vale Railway]] replaced the canal barges and massive marshalling yards sprang up as new docks were developed in Cardiff – all prompted by the soaring worldwide demand for coal from the South Wales valleys.

At its peak, Cardiff's [[port]] area, known as [[Tiger Bay]], became the busiest port in the world and—for some time—the world's most important [[coal]] port.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grauniad Dinas&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/2009/jun/09/walk-guides-cardiff-wales-architecture?page=2 |title = Cardiff's millennium makeover, Cardiff – Travel – The Guardian |accessdate = 2&amp;nbsp;June&amp;nbsp;2010 |date = 9 June 2009 |publisher = [[The Guardian]] |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC Dinas&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/2854567.stm |title = BBC News – Wales – Capital claims – A city's struggle |accessdate = 2&amp;nbsp;June&amp;nbsp;2010 |date = 22&amp;nbsp;April&amp;nbsp;2003 |publisher = [[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the years leading up to the [[World War I|First World War]], more than 10 million tonnes of coal was exported annually from [[Cardiff Docks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/en/rhagor/article/?article_id=50|title=Cardiff – Coal and Shipping Metropolis of the World|publisher=National Museum of Wales|accessdate=2008-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1907, Cardiff's [[Coal Exchange]] was the first host to a business deal for a million [[Pound Sterling|pounds Sterling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glamro.gov.uk/check/Building%20of%20a%20Capital%202/A_Why.html|title=Why Did Cardiff Grow?|publisher=Glamorgan record Office|accessdate=2008-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a period of decline, Cardiff's port has started to grow again – over 3 million tonnes of cargo passed through the docks in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://newsvote.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/7414502.stm|title=Ports' resurgence as imports grow|date=2008-05-22|publisher=BBC News Wales|accessdate=2008-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other major employers include [[NHS Wales]] and the [[National Assembly for Wales]]. On 1 March 2004, Cardiff was granted [[Fairtrade City]] status.

Cardiff is the one of the most popular tourist destination cities in the United Kingdom, receiving 14.6 million visitors in 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;tourism&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/cardiffonline/cardiff-news/2010/10/27/report-highlights-booming-tourist-trade-in-cardiff-91466-27548342/|title=Report highlights booming tourist trade in Cardiff

==Landmarks and attractions==
[[File:Millennium Stadium North.jpg|thumb|upright|Millennium Stadium]]
Cardiff has many landmark buildings such as the [[Millennium Stadium]], [[Pierhead Building]] the Welsh National Museum and the [[Senedd]], the home of the [[National Assembly for Wales]]. However Cardiff is also famous for [[Cardiff Castle]], [[St David's Hall]], [[Llandaff Cathedral]] and the [[Wales Millennium Centre]]. 

[[Cardiff Castle]] is a major tourist attraction in the city and is situated in the heart of the city centre. The [[St Fagans National History Museum|National History Museum at St Fagans]] in Cardiff is a large open air museum housing dozens of buildings from throughout Welsh history that have been moved to the site in Cardiff. The Civic Centre in [[Cathays Park]] comprises a collection of [[Edwardian architecture|Edwardian]] buildings such as the [[City Hall, Cardiff|City Hall]], [[National Museum Cardiff|National Museum and Gallery of Wales]], [[Cardiff Crown Court]], and buildings forming part of [[Cardiff University]], together with more modern civic buildings. These buildings surround a small green space containing the [[Welsh National War Memorial]] and a number of other smaller memorials.

In addition to [[Cardiff Castle]], [[Castell Coch]] ({{lang-en|Red Castle}}) is located in [[Tongwynlais]], in the [[Cardiff North|north]] of the city. The current castle is an elaborately decorated Victorian [[folly]] designed by [[William Burges (architect)|William Burges]] for the Marquess and built in the 1870s, as an occasional retreat. However, the Victorian castle stands on the footings of a much older medieval castle possibly built by [[Ifor Bach]], a regional baron with links to Cardiff Castle also. The exterior has become a popular location for film and television productions. It rarely fulfilled its intended role as a retreat for the Butes, who seldom stayed there. For the Marquess, the pleasure had been in its creation, a pleasure lost following Burges's death in 1881.

Situated on the narrowest part of the south Wales coastal plain, Cardiff had a crucial strategic importance in the wars between the Normans (who had occupied lowland Wales) and the Welsh who maintained their hold on the uplands. As a result Cardiff claims to have the largest concentration of [[castles]] of any city in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.skysports.com/rugbyunion/World_Cup/Story/0,21043,13092_2689478,00.html|title=2007 Rugby World Cup City Guides – Cardiff|publisher=Sky Sports|accessdate=2008-04-19| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080405094448/http://www.skysports.com/rugbyunion/World_Cup/Story/0,21043,13092_2689478,00.html| archivedate = April 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; As well as Cardiff Castle and Castell Coch, the remains of Twmpath Castle,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.castlewales.com/twmpath.html|title=Twmpath Castle|year=2002|accessdate=2008-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Llandaff Bishop's Palace and [[St Fagans National History Museum|Saint Fagans Castle]] are still in existence, whilst the site of Treoda (or Whitchurch Castle) has now been built over.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://homepage.mac.com/philipdavis/Welshsites/482.html|title=The Gatehouse: Treoda, Whitchurch|date=2007-10-08|accessdate=2007-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other major tourist attractions are the [[Cardiff Bay]] regeneration sites which include the recently opened Wales Millennium Centre and the [[Senedd]], and many other cultural and sites of interest including the [[Cardiff Bay Barrage]] and the famous [[Coal Exchange]]. The [[New Theatre (Cardiff)|New Theatre]] was founded in 1906 and completely refurbished in the 1980s. Until the opening of the Wales Millennium Centre in 2004, it was the premier venue in Wales for touring theatre and dance companies. Other venues which are popular for concerts and sporting events include [[Cardiff International Arena]], [[St David's Hall]] and the [[Millennium Stadium]]. [[Cardiff Story]], a museum documenting the city's history, is to open in Spring 2011.

Cardiff has over 1,000 listed buildings, ranging from the more prominent buildings such as the castles, to smaller buildings, houses and structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://64.233.183.104/search?q=cache:v1WqH_pRIwUJ:www.cardiff.gov.uk/content.asp%3FParent_Directory_id%3D2865%26nav%3D2870,3139,3939,3972+cardiff+listed+buildings&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=1&amp;gl=uk|title=Listed and Locally Listed Buildings|publisher=Cardiff County Council|accessdate=2008-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Telecommunications==
{{See also|List of Wales dialling codes}}
'''029''' is the current telephone dialling code for Cardiff, as well as for the neighbouring towns of [[Penarth]], [[Dinas Powys]] and [[Caerphilly]]. The dialling code is optional when dialling within the area, with it being possible to dial between any two phones within the 029 code using only the eight-digit local number. 

Prior to the [[Big Number Change]] on 22 April 2000 the area had shorter, six-digit local numbers with an area code of 01222 (with 0222 preceeding this, prior to May 1995). There remains a common misconception that local numbers are still six digits long and that the code is 02920, despite the existence of newer Cardiff numbers in the ranges (029) 21xx xxxx and (029) 22xx xxxx.

'''Charles John Huffam Dickens''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|tʃ|ɑr|l|z|_|ˈ|d|ɪ|k|ɪ|n|z}}; 7 February 1812 – 9 June 1870) was the most popular English novelist of the [[Victorian era]], and he remains popular, responsible for some of English literature's most iconic characters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/05/23/news/23web-dickens.php &quot;Victorian squalor and hi-tech gadgetry: Dickens World to open in England&quot;], ''The New York Times'', 23 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of his novels, with their recurrent concern for [[Reform movement|social reform]], first appeared in magazines in [[Serial (literature)|serialised]] form, a popular format at the time. Unlike other authors who completed entire novels before serialisation, Dickens often created the episodes as they were being serialized. The practice lent his stories a particular rhythm, punctuated by [[cliffhangers]] to keep the public looking forward to the next installment.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, Harry. ''Dickens' Working Notes for His Novels''. Chicago, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; The continuing popularity of his novels and short stories is such that they have never gone [[Out-of-print book|out of print]].&lt;ref name=AHP&gt;Swift, Simon. [http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2007/apr/18/classics.travelnews &quot;What the Dickens?&quot;], ''The Guardian'', 18 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

His work has been praised for its [[realism]], mastery of prose, comic genius and unique personalities by writers such as [[George Gissing]], [[Leo Tolstoy]], and [[G. K. Chesterton]]; though others, such as [[Henry James]] and [[Virginia Woolf]], criticized it for sentimentality and implausibility.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20071207125820/http://humwww.ucsc.edu/dickens/OMF/james.html Henry James, &quot;Our Mutual Friend&quot;], ''The Nation'', 21 December 1865.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
===Early years===
[[Image:ChathamOrdnanceTerrCrop.jpg|left|thumb|180px|2 Ordnance Terrace, [[Chatham, Kent|Chatham]], Dickens's  home 1817–1822]]
Charles Dickens was born in 1812. Having spent the first three years of his life in [[Portsmouth]], [[Hampshire]], the family moved to [[London]] in 1815. His early years seem to have been idyllic, although he thought himself as a &quot;very small and not-over-particularly-taken-care-of boy&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lang.nagoya-u.ac.jp/~matsuoka/CD-Forster-1.html |title=John Forster, '&amp;#39;The Life of Charles Dickens'&amp;#39;, Book 1, Chapter 2  |publisher=Lang.nagoya-u.ac.jp |date= |accessdate=24 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He spent time outdoors, but also read voraciously, especially the [[picaresque novel]]s of [[Tobias Smollett]] and [[Henry Fielding]]. He spoke, later in life, of his poignant memories of childhood, and of his near-photographic memory of the people and events, which he used in his writing. His father's brief period as a clerk in the Navy Pay Office afforded Charles a few years of private education at William Giles's School, in [[Chatham, Kent|Chatham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jordan|first=John|title=The Cambridge companion to Charles Dickens|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, England|year=2001|page=xvi|chapter=Chronology|isbn=0-521-66964-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This period came to an abrupt end when [[John Dickens]] spent beyond his means and was imprisoned in the [[Marshalsea]] [[debtor's prison]] in Southwark, London. Shortly afterwards, the rest of his family joined him – except Charles, who boarded with family friend Elizabeth Roylance in [[Camden Town]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pope-Hennessy|first=Una |authorlink=Una Pope-Hennessy|title=Charles Dickens 1812–1870|publisher=Chatto and Windus|location=London|year=1945|page=11|chapter=The Family Background|isbn=0897607627}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mrs. Roylance was &quot;a [[poverty|reduced]] old lady, long known to our family&quot;, whom Dickens later immortalized, &quot;with a few alterations and embellishments&quot;, as &quot;Mrs. Pipchin&quot;, in ''[[Dombey and Son]]''. Later, he lived in a &quot;back-attic...at the house of an insolvent-court agent...in [[Lant Street]] in [[Southwark|The Borough]]...he was a fat, good-natured, kind old gentleman, with a quiet old wife&quot;; and he had a very innocent grown-up son; these three were the inspiration for the Garland family in ''[[The Old Curiosity Shop]]''.&lt;ref name=gutenberg&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/25851/25851-h/25851-h.htm Project Gutenberg's ''Life of Charles Dickens'' (James R. Osgood &amp; Company, 1875), by John Forster, Volume I, Chapter II, accessed 2 August 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Second Marshalsea prison in the 19th or 20th century.png|right|thumb|180px|The [[Marshalsea]] around 1897, after it had closed]]

On Sundays, Dickens and his sister Fanny were allowed out from the [[Royal Academy of Music]] and spent the day at the Marshalsea.&lt;ref name=anguswilson&gt;
{{cite book|title=The World of Charles Dickens|author=[[Angus Wilson]]|publisher=[[Secker and Warburg]], 1970.|location=London|isbn=0140034889 }} p.53&lt;/ref&gt; (Dickens later used the prison as a setting in ''[[Little Dorrit]]''). To pay for his board and to help his family, Dickens began working ten-hour days at Warren's [[shoe polish|Blacking]] Warehouse, on Hungerford Stairs, near the present [[Charing Cross railway station]]. He earned six [[shilling]]s a week pasting labels on shoe polish. The strenuous – and often cruel – work conditions made a deep impression on Dickens, and later influenced his fiction and essays, forming foundation of his interest in the reform of socio-economic and labour conditions, the rigors of which he believed were unfairly borne by the poor. As told to [[John Forster (biographer)|John Forster]] (from ''The Life of Charles Dickens''):
[[Image:Dickens-at-the-Blacking-Warehouse.jpg|left|thumb|150px|A 1904 artist's impression of Dickens in the shoe-polish factory]]

&lt;blockquote&gt;The blacking-warehouse was the last house on the left-hand side of the way, at old Hungerford Stairs. It was a crazy, tumble-down old house, abutting of course on the river, and literally overrun with rats. Its wainscoted rooms, and its rotten floors and staircase, and the old grey rats swarming down in the cellars, and the sound of their squeaking and scuffling coming up the stairs at all times, and the dirt and decay of the place, rise up visibly before me, as if I were there again. The counting-house was on the first floor, looking over the coal-barges and the river. There was a recess in it, in which I was to sit and work. My work was to cover the pots of paste-blacking; first with a piece of oil-paper, and then with a piece of blue paper; to tie them round with a string; and then to clip the paper close and neat, all round, until it looked as smart as a pot of ointment from an apothecary's shop. When a certain number of grosses of pots had attained this pitch of perfection, I was to paste on each a printed label, and then go on again with more pots. Two or three other boys were kept at similar duty down-stairs on similar wages. One of them came up, in a ragged apron and a paper cap, on the first Monday morning, to show me the trick of using the string and tying the knot. His name was Bob Fagin; and I took the liberty of using his name, long afterwards, in Oliver Twist.&lt;ref name=gutenberg/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After only a few months in Marshalsea, John Dickens' paternal grandmother, Elizabeth Dickens, died and bequeathed him the sum of £450. On the expectation of this legacy, Dickens was granted release from prison. Under the [[Act of Parliament|Insolvent Debtors Act]], Dickens arranged for payment of his creditors, and he and his family left Marshalsea for the home of Mrs. Roylance.

Although Dickens eventually attended the Wellington House Academy in [[North London]], his mother [[Elizabeth Dickens]] did not immediately remove him from the boot-blacking factory. 'The incident  must have done much to confirm Dickens's determined view that a father should rule the family, a mother find her proper sphere inside the home. &quot;I never afterwards forgot, I never shall forget, I never can forget, that my mother was warm for my being sent back.&quot; His mother's failure to request his return was no doubt a factor in his demanding and dissatisfied attitude towards women.'&lt;ref name=anguswilson /&gt; Resentment stemming from his situation and the conditions under which [[working class|working-class]] people lived became major themes of his works, and it was this unhappy period in his youth to which he alluded in his favourite, and most [[autobiographical novel|autobiographical, novel]], ''[[David Copperfield (novel)|David Copperfield]]'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/authors/charles-dickens |title=&quot;Charles Dickens&quot;, accessed 15&amp;nbsp;November 2007 |publisher=Enotes.com |date= |accessdate=24 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;I had no advice, no counsel, no encouragement, no consolation, no assistance, no support, of any kind, from anyone, that I can call to mind, as I hope to go to heaven!&quot; The Wellington House Academy was not a good school. 'Much of the haphazard, desultory teaching, poor discipline punctuated by the headmaster's sadistic brutality, the seedy ushers and general run-down atmosphere, are embodied in Mr. Creakle's Establishment in ''David Copperfield''.'&lt;ref name=anguswilson/&gt;
Dickens worked at the law office of Ellis and Blackmore, attorneys, of Holborn Court, [[Gray's Inn]], as a junior [[law clerk|clerk]] from May 1827 to November 1828. Then, having learned Gurneys system of shorthand in his spare time, he left to become a freelance reporter. A distant relative, Thomas Charlton, was a freelance reporter at [[Doctors' Commons]], and Dickens was able to share his box there to report the legal proceedings for nearly four years.&lt;ref&gt;Pope-Hennessy (1945: 18)&lt;/ref&gt;  This education informed works such as ''[[Nicholas Nickleby]]'', ''[[Dombey and Son]]'', and especially ''[[Bleak House]]''—whose vivid portrayal of the machinations and bureaucracy of the legal system did much to enlighten the general public, and was a vehicle for dissemination of Dickens's own views regarding, particularly, the heavy burden on the poor who were forced by circumstances to &quot;go to law&quot;.

In 1830, Dickens met his first love, Maria Beadnell, thought to have been the model for the character Dora in ''David Copperfield''. Maria's parents disapproved of the courtship and effectively ended the relationship by sending her to school in Paris.

===Journalism and early novels===
In 1833, Dickens' first story, ''A Dinner at Poplar Walk'' was published in the London   periodical, ''Monthly Magazine''. The following year he rented rooms at [[Furnival's Inn]] becoming a political journalist, reporting on parliamentary debate and travelling across Britain to cover election campaigns for the ''[[Morning Chronicle]]''. His journalism, in the form of sketches in periodicals, formed his first collection of pieces ''[[Sketches by Boz]]'', published in 1836.  This led to the serialisation of his first novel, ''[[The Pickwick Papers]]'', in March 1836. He continued to contribute to and edit journals throughout his literary career.
[[Image:Charles Dickens by Daniel Maclise.jpg|thumb|An 1839 portrait of a young Charles Dickens by [[Daniel Maclise]]]]

In 1836, Dickens accepted the job of editor of ''[[Bentley's Miscellany]]'', a position he held for three years, until he fell out with the owner. At the same time, his success as a novelist continued, producing ''[[Oliver Twist]]'' (1837–39), ''Nicholas Nickleby'' (1838–39), ''The Old Curiosity Shop'' and, finally, ''[[Barnaby Rudge|Barnaby Rudge: A Tale of the Riots of 'Eighty]]'' as part of the ''[[Master Humphrey's Clock]]'' series (1840–41)—all published in monthly instalments before being made into books. During this period Dickens kept a pet [[raven]] named Grip, which he had stuffed when it died in 1841. (it is now at the [[Free Library of Philadelphia]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://palimpsest.stanford.edu/byform/mailing-lists/exlibris/1999/07/msg00399.html RE: Cremains / Ravens&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 April 1836, he married [[Catherine Dickens|Catherine Thomson Hogarth]] (1816&amp;nbsp;– 1879), the daughter of [[George Hogarth]], editor of the ''[[Evening Chronicle]]''. After a brief honeymoon in [[Chalk, Kent|Chalk]], Kent, they set up [[Charles Dickens Museum, London|home in Bloomsbury]].

Dickens and his family lived at [[Charles Dickens Museum|48 Doughty Street]], London, (on which he had a three year lease at £80 a year) from 25 March 1837 until December 1839. Dickens's younger brother [[Frederick Dickens|Frederick]] and Catherine's 17-year-old sister Mary moved in with them. Dickens became very attached to Mary, and she died in his arms after a brief illness in 1837. She became a character in many of his books, and her death is fictionalised as the death of Nell in ''The Old Curiosity Shop''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/dickens/maryhogarth.html Victorianweb.org] – Mary Scott Hogarth, 1820–1837: Dickens's Beloved Sister-in-Law and Inspiration&lt;/ref&gt;

===First visit to America===
[[File:Francis Alexander - Charles Dickens 1842.jpeg|upright|thumb|left|Dickens in 1842]]

In 1842, Dickens and his wife made his first trip to the United States and Canada, a journey which was successful in spite of his support for the [[abolition of slavery]]. It is described in the [[Travel literature|travelogue]] ''[[American Notes|American Notes for General Circulation]]'' and is also the basis of some of the episodes in ''[[Martin Chuzzlewit]]''. Dickens includes in ''Notes'' a powerful condemnation of slavery,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |first=John |last=Bowen |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Dickens's Black Atlantic |booktitle=Dickens and empire: discourses of class, race and colonialism in the works of Charles Dickens |page=53 |publisher= Ashgate|date=2004 |location= Farnham, England|url= |accessdate= |isbn=978-0-7546-3412-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with &quot;ample proof&quot; of the &quot;atrocities&quot; he found.&lt;ref name=notes&gt;{{cite book|last=Dickens|first=Charles|title=American Notes for General Circulation|publisher=Chapman and Hall|location=London|year=1842|pages=94–100|chapter=Slavery|oclc=41667089|isbn=0460876856}}&lt;/ref&gt; He called upon President [[John Tyler]] at the [[White House]].&lt;ref&gt;Dickens (1842: 53–55)&lt;/ref&gt;

During his visit, Dickens spent a month in [[New York, New York|New York City]], giving lectures, raising support for copyright laws, and recording many of his impressions of America. He met such luminaries as [[Washington Irving]] and [[William Cullen Bryant]]. On 14 February 1842, a Boz Ball was held in his honour at the [[Park Theater (Manhattan)|Park Theater]], with 3,000 guests. Among the neighbourhoods he visited were [[Five Points, Manhattan|Five Points]], [[Wall Street]], The [[Bowery]], and the prison known as [[The Tombs]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Citycyclopedia&quot;&gt;Kenneth T. Jackson: ''The Encyclopedia of New York City'': The New York Historical Society; [[Yale University Press]]; 1995. P. 333.&lt;/ref&gt; At this time [[Georgina Hogarth]], another sister of Catherine, joined the Dickens household, now living at Devonshire Terrace, [[Marylebone]], to care for the young family they had left behind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Richard|title=Walking Dickensian London|publisher=New Holland|location=London|year=2004|page=7|isbn=9781843304838}}&lt;/ref&gt; She remained with them as housekeeper, organiser, adviser and friend until her brother-in-law's death in 1870.

Shortly thereafter, he began to show interest in [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] Christianity, although he remained an [[Anglican]] for the rest of his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uua.org/uuhs/duub/articles/charlesdickens.html |title=Charles Dickens |publisher=Uua.org |date= |accessdate=24 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dickens's   work continued to be popular, especially ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'' written in 1843, which was reputedly a [[potboiler]] written in a matter of weeks to meet the expenses of his wife's fifth pregnancy. After living briefly abroad in Italy (1844) and Switzerland (1846), Dickens continued his success with ''[[Dombey and Son]]'' (1848) and ''David Copperfield'' (1849–50).

===Philanthropy===
In May 1846, [[Angela Burdett-Coutts, 1st Baroness Burdett-Coutts|Angela Burdett Coutts]], heir to the Coutts banking fortune, approached Dickens about setting up a home for the redemption of &quot;fallen&quot; women. Coutts envisioned a home that would differ from existing institutions, which offered a harsh and punishing regimen for these women, and instead provide an environment where they could learn to read and write and become proficient in domestic household chores so as to re-integrate them into society. After initially resisting, Dickens eventually founded the home, named Urania Cottage, in the Lime Grove section of [[Shepherds Bush]]. He became involved in many aspects of its day-to-day running, setting the house rules, reviewing the accounts and interviewing prospective residents, some of whom became characters in his books. He would scour prisons and workhouses for potentially suitable candidates and relied on friends, such as the Magistrate John Hardwick to bring them to his attention. Each potential candidate was given a printed invitation written by Dickens called ‘An Appeal to Fallen Women’,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wwwsoc.nii.ac.jp/dickens/etexts/dickens/others/sonota/fallen.pdf |title='An Appeal to Fallen Women' |accessdate=6 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; which he signed only as ‘Your friend’. If the woman accepted the invitation, Dickens would personally interview her for admission.&lt;ref&gt;Adams Hamilton Literary and Historical Manuscripts, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'The Letters of Charles Dickens', Pilgrim Edition, Vol. VII, p.527.&lt;/ref&gt; All of the women were required to emigrate following their time at Urania Cottage. In research published in 2009, the families of two of these women were identified, one in Canada and one in Australia. It is estimated that about 100 women graduated between 1847 and 1859.&lt;ref&gt;Jenny Hartley, ''Charles Dickens and The House of Fallen Women'', (Methuen, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Charles Dickens by Ary Scheffer 1855.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Dickens painted by [[Ary Scheffer]], 1855. Dickens wrote to John Forster of the experience: &quot;I can scarcely express how uneasy and unsettled it makes me to sit, sit, sit, with ''Little Dorrit'' on my mind.&quot;]]
In late November 1851, Dickens moved into [[Tavistock House]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=65184 |title=Tavistock House &amp;#124; British History Online |publisher=British-history.ac.uk |date=22 June 2003 |accessdate=24 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he would write ''Bleak House'' (1852–53), ''[[Hard Times]]'' (1854) and ''Little Dorrit'' (1857). It was here he got up the amateur theatricals which are described in Forster's Life.
[[File:Charles Dickens by Antoine Claudet, 1852.png|left|thumb|Photograph of the author, c. 1852]]

===Middle years===
In 1856, his income from his writing allowed him to buy [[Gad's Hill Place]] in [[Higham, Kent|Higham]], Kent. As a child, Dickens had walked past the house and dreamed of living in it. The area was also the scene of some of the events of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] ''[[Henry IV, Part 1]]'' and this literary connection pleased him.

In 1857, Dickens hired professional actresses for the play ''[[The Frozen Deep]]'', which he and his protégé [[Wilkie Collins]] had written. With one of these, [[Ellen Ternan]], Dickens formed a bond which was to last the rest of his life. He then separated from his wife, Catherine, in 1858 – divorce was still unthinkable for someone as famous as he was.

During this period, whilst pondering about giving public readings for his own profit, Dickens was approached by [[Great Ormond Street Hospital]] to help it survive its first major financial crisis through a charitable appeal. Dickens, whose philanthropy was well-known, was asked to preside by his friend, the hospital's founder [[Charles West (physician)|Charles West]]. He threw himself into the task, heart and soul&lt;ref&gt;Charles Dickens: Family History edited by Norman Page, University of Nottingham&lt;/ref&gt; (a little known fact is that Dickens reported anonymously in the weekly ''The Examiner'' in 1849 to help mishandled children and wrote another article to help publicise the hospital's opening in 1852).&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Charles Dickens' Work to Help Establish Great Ormond Street Hospital, London.&quot; by Sir Howard Markel, The Lancet, 21 Aug, p 673.&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 February 1858, Dickens spoke at the hospital's first annual festival dinner at Freemasons' Hall and later gave a public reading of ''A Christmas Carol'' at [[St Martin-in-the-Fields|St. Martin-in-the-Fields]] church hall. The events raised enough money to enable the hospital to purchase the neighbouring house, No. 48 Great Ormond Street, increasing the bed capacity from 20 to 75.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sofii.org/ Sofii.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

That summer of 1858, after separating from his wife,&lt;ref&gt;''Household Words'' 12 June 1858&lt;/ref&gt; Dickens undertook his first series of public readings in London for pay which ended on 22 July. After 10 days rest, he began a gruelling and ambitious tour through the English provinces, Scotland and Ireland, beginning with a performance in Clifton on 2 August and closing in [[Brighton]], more than three months later, on 13 November. Altogether he read eighty-seven times, on some days giving both a matinée and an evening performance.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;The New York Public Library, Berg Collection of English and American Literature&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Dickens by Watkins detail.jpg|thumb|left|At his desk in 1858]]
Major works, ''[[A Tale of Two Cities]]'' (1859); and ''[[Great Expectations]]'' (1861) soon followed and would prove resounding successes. During this time he was also the publisher and editor of, and a major contributor to, the journals ''[[Household Words]]'' (1850–1859) and ''[[All the Year Round]]'' (1858–1870).

In early September 1860, in a field behind Gad's Hill, Dickens made a great bonfire of nearly his entire correspondence. Only those letters on business matters were spared. Since Ellen Ternan burned all of his letters as well, the dimensions of the affair between the two were unknown until the publication of ''Dickens and Daughter'', a book about Dickens's  relationship with his daughter Kate, in 1939. Kate Dickens worked with author Gladys Storey on the book prior to her death in 1929, and alleged that Dickens and Ternan had a son who died in infancy, though no contemporary evidence exists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laits.utexas.edu/farrell/documents/Dickens%20and%20Ternan.pdf|title=The Invisible Woman: The Story of Charles Dickens and Nelly Ternan|last=Tomalin|year=1995|accessdate=13 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On his death, Dickens settled an [[Life annuity|annuity]] on Ternan which made her a financially independent woman. Claire Tomalin's book, ''The Invisible Woman'', set out to prove that Ternan lived with Dickens secretly for the last 13 years of his life, and was subsequently turned into a play, ''Little Nell'', by [[Simon Gray]].

In the same period, Dickens furthered his interest in the [[paranormal]], so much that he was one of the early members of [[The Ghost Club]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ghostclub.org.uk/history.htm|title=History of the Ghost Club|accessdate=30 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Franklin incident====
A recurring theme in Dickens's  writing reflected the public's interest in Arctic exploration: the heroic friendship between explorers [[John Franklin]] and [[John Richardson (naturalist)|John Richardson]] gave the idea for ''A Tale of Two Cities'', ''The Wreck of the Golden Mary'' and the play ''[[The Frozen Deep]]''.&lt;ref name=rfg&gt;{{cite book|last=Glancy|first=Ruth F|title=Charles Dickens's A Tale Of Two Cities: A Sourcebook|publisher=Routledge|location=Abingdon, England|year=2006|pages=14|chapter=The Frozen Deep and other Biographical Influences|isbn=0415287596}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Franklin died in unexplained circumstances on an expedition to find the [[North West Passage]], Dickens wrote a piece in ''Household Words'' defending his hero against the discovery in 1854, some four years after the search began, of evidence that Franklin's men had, in their desperation, resorted to cannibalism.&lt;ref name=tlav&gt;{{cite journal

===Last years===
[[Image:Staplehurst rail crash.jpg|thumb|Crash scene after the [[Staplehurst rail crash]]]]
On 9 June 1865,&lt;ref&gt;Slater (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; while returning from Paris with [[Ellen Ternan|Ternan]], Dickens was involved in the [[Staplehurst rail crash]].  The first seven carriages of the train plunged off a [[cast iron]] bridge under repair. The only [[first class travel|first-class]] carriage to remain on the track was the one in which Dickens was travelling. Dickens tried to help the wounded and the dying before rescuers arrived. Before leaving, he remembered the unfinished manuscript for ''[[Our Mutual Friend]]'', and he returned to his carriage to retrieve it. Typically, Dickens later used this experience as material for his short [[ghost story]] ''[[The Signal-Man]]'' in which the central character has a premonition of his own death in a rail crash. He based the story around several previous [[List of rail accidents (pre-1950)|rail accidents]], such as the [[Clayton Tunnel rail crash]] of 1861.

Dickens managed to avoid an appearance at the [[inquest]], to avoid disclosing that he had been  travelling with Ternan and her mother, which would have caused a scandal. Although physically unharmed, Dickens never really recovered from the trauma of the Staplehurst crash, and his normally prolific writing shrank to completing ''Our Mutual Friend'' and starting the unfinished ''[[The Mystery of Edwin Drood]]''. Much of his time was taken up with public readings from his best-loved novels. Dickens was fascinated by the theatre as an escape from the world, and theatres and theatrical people appear in ''Nicholas Nickleby''. The travelling shows were extremely popular. In 1866, a series of public readings were undertaken in England and Scotland. The following year saw more readings in England and Ireland.

===Second visit to America===
On 9 November 1867, Dickens sailed from [[Liverpool]] for his second American reading tour. Landing at [[Boston]], he devoted the rest of the month to a round of dinners with such notables as [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]] and his American publisher [[James Thomas Fields]]. In early December, the readings began and Dickens spent the month shuttling between Boston and New York. Although he had started to suffer from what he called the &quot;true American catarrh&quot;, he kept to a schedule that would have challenged a much younger man, even managing to squeeze in some sleighing in [[Central Park]]. In New York, he gave 22 readings at [[Steinway Hall]] between 9 December 1867 and 18 April 1868, and four at [[Plymouth Church of the Pilgrims]] between 16 January and 21 January 1868. During his travels, he saw a significant change in the people and the circumstances of America. His final appearance was at a banquet the American Press held in his honour at [[Delmonico's Restaurant|Delmonico's]] on 18 April, when he promised to never denounce America again. By the end of the tour, the author could hardly manage solid food, subsisting on champagne and eggs beaten in sherry. On 23 April, he boarded his ship to return to Britain, barely escaping a [[tax lien|Federal Tax Lien]] against the proceeds of his lecture tour.&lt;ref name=&quot;Citycyclopedia&quot; /&gt;

===Farewell readings===
Between 1868 and 1869, Dickens gave a series of &quot;farewell readings&quot; in England, Scotland, and Ireland, until he collapsed on 22 April 1869, at [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]] in [[Lancashire]] showing symptoms of a mild [[stroke]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nypl.org/research/chss/spe/brg/lifeofauthor/6magician.html |title=New York Public Library / The Great Magician Vanishes |publisher=Nypl.org |date= |accessdate=24 July 2009}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; After further provincial readings were cancelled, he began work on his final novel, ''The Mystery of Edwin Drood''. In an [[opium den]] in [[Shadwell]], he witnessed an elderly pusher known as &quot;Opium Sal&quot;, who subsequently featured in his mystery novel.
[[Image:Dickensposter nottingham1869.jpg|thumb|upright|Poster promoting a reading by Dickens in [[Nottingham]] dated 4 Feb. 1869; two months before he suffered a mild stroke]]
When he had regained sufficient strength, Dickens arranged, with medical approval, for a final series of readings at least partially to make up to his sponsors what they had lost due of his illness. There were to be twelve performances, running between 11 January and 15 March 1870, the last taking place at 8:00 pm at [[St. James's Hall]] in London. Although in grave health by this time, he read ''A Christmas Carol'' and ''The Trial from Pickwick''. On 2 May, he made his last public appearance at a [[Royal Academy]] Banquet in the presence of the [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Prince]] and [[Alexandra of Denmark|Princess of Wales]], paying a special tribute to the passing of his friend, illustrator [[Daniel Maclise]].&lt;ref&gt;The British Academy/The Pilgrim Edition of the Letters of Charles Dickens: Volume 12: 1868–1870&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
On 8 June 1870, Dickens suffered another stroke at his home, after a full day's work on ''Edwin Drood''. The next day, on 9 June, and five years to the day after the Staplehurst crash, he died at Gad's Hill Place never having regained consciousness. Contrary to his wish to be buried at [[Rochester Cathedral]] &quot;in an inexpensive, unostentatious, and strictly private manner&quot;, he was laid to rest in the [[Poets' Corner]] of [[Westminster Abbey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.westminster-abbey.org/our-history/people/charles-dickens|title=Charles Dickens|last=Staff writers|year=2007|work=History|publisher=The Dean and Chapter of Westminster Abbey|quote=A small stone with a simple inscription marks the grave of this famous English novelist in Poets' Corner: 'Charles Dickens Born 7 February 1812 Died 9&amp;nbsp;June 1870'&amp;nbsp;|accessdate=12 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A printed epitaph circulated at the time of the funeral reads: &quot;To the Memory of Charles Dickens (England's most popular author) who died at his residence, Higham, near Rochester, Kent, 9 June 1870, aged 58 years. He was a sympathiser with the poor, the suffering, and the oppressed; and by his death, one of England's greatest writers is lost to the world.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Printed at J. H. Woodley's Funeral Tablet Office, 30 Fore Street, City, London.&quot; and reproduced on page 4, ''[http://www.dallastheatercenter.org/PublicDocs/XmasCarolStudyGuide.pdf A Christmas Carol Study Guide]'' by Patti Kirkpatrick, Education Department, [[Dallas Theater Center]].&lt;/ref&gt; Dickens's last words, as reported in his obituary in [[The Times]] were alleged to have been:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Be natural my children. For the writer that is natural has fullfilled all the rules of art.&lt;ref&gt;Green, J. (1979), ''Famous Last Words'', Enderby, Leicester, Silverdale Books, ISBN 1-85626-577-9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On Sunday, 19 June 1870, five days after Dickens's  interment in the Abbey, Dean [[Arthur Penrhyn Stanley]] delivered a memorial elegy, lauding &quot;the genial and loving humorist whom we now mourn&quot;, for showing by his own example &quot;that even in dealing with the darkest scenes and the most degraded characters, genius could still be clean, and mirth could be innocent.&quot; Pointing to the fresh flowers that adorned the novelist's grave, Stanley assured those present that &quot;the spot would thenceforth be a sacred one with both the New World and the Old, as that of the representative of literature, not of this island only, but of all who speak our English tongue.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;New York Public Library, Berg Collection&lt;/ref&gt;

Dickens's will stipulated that no memorial be erected to honour him. The only life-size bronze statue of Dickens, cast in 1891 by [[Francis Edwin Elwell]], is located in [[Clark Park]] in the [[Spruce Hill, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Spruce Hill]] neighbourhood of [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania in the United States. The couch on which he died is preserved at the Dickens Birthplace Museum in Portsmouth.

==Literary style==
Dickens loved the style of 18th century [[Gothic romance]], {{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} although it had already become a target for [[parody]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Austen|first=Jane|title=Northanger Abbey}}&lt;/ref&gt; One &quot;character&quot; vividly drawn throughout his novels is London itself. From the [[coaching inn]]s on the outskirts of the city to the lower reaches of the [[Thames]], all aspects of the capital are described over the course of his body of work.

His writing style is florid and poetic, with a strong comic touch. His [[satire]]s of British aristocratic snobbery—he calls one character the &quot;Noble Refrigerator&quot;—are often popular. Comparing orphans to stocks and shares, people to tug boats, or dinner-party guests to furniture are just some of Dickens's  acclaimed flights of fancy. Many of his characters' names provide the reader with a hint as to the roles played in advancing the storyline, such as Mr. Murdstone in the novel David Copperfield, which is clearly a combination of &quot;murder&quot; and stony coldness. His literary style is also a mixture of [[fantasy]] and [[realism (arts)|realism]].

===Characters===
[[Image:Dickens dream.jpg|thumb|250px|'Dickens' Dream' by [[Robert William Buss]], portraying Dickens at his desk at [[Gads Hill Place]] surrounded by many of his characters]]

Dickens is famed for his depiction of the hardships of the working class, his intricate plots, and his sense of humour. But he is perhaps most famed for the characters he created. His novels were heralded early in his career for their ability to capture the everyday man and thus create characters to whom readers could relate. Beginning with ''[[The Pickwick Papers]]'' in 1836, Dickens wrote numerous novels, each uniquely filled with believable personalities and vivid physical descriptions. Dickens's  friend and biographer, [[John Forster (biographer)|John Forster]], said that Dickens made &quot;characters real existences, not by describing them but by letting them describe themselves.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;The Life of Charles Dickens (first published 1872–1874) by John Forster&lt;/ref&gt;

Dickensian [[List of Dickensian characters|characters]]—especially their typically whimsical names—are among the most memorable in English literature. The likes of [[Ebenezer Scrooge]], [[Tiny Tim (A Christmas Carol)|Tiny Tim]], [[Jacob Marley]], [[Bob Cratchit]], [[Oliver Twist (character)|Oliver Twist]], [[Artful Dodger|The Artful Dodger]], [[Fagin]], [[Bill Sikes]], Pip, [[Miss Havisham]], [[Charles Darnay]], [[David Copperfield (character)|David Copperfield]], [[Wilkins Micawber|Mr. Micawber]], [[Abel Magwitch]], [[Daniel Quilp]], [[Samuel Pickwick]], [[Wackford Squeers]], [[Uriah Heep]] and many others are so well known and can be believed to be living a life outside the novels that their stories have been continued by other authors. {{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

The author worked closely with his illustrators supplying them with a summary of the work at the outset and thus ensuring that his characters and settings were exactly how he envisioned them.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Dickens and His Original Illustrators by Jane R. Cohen. Ohio State University Press&lt;/ref&gt; He would brief the illustrator on plans for each month's instalment so that work could begin before he wrote them. [[Marcus Stone]], illustrator of ''Our Mutual Friend'', recalled that the author was always &quot;ready to describe down to the minutest details the personal characteristics, and ... life-history of the creations of his fancy.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt; This close working relationship is important to readers of Dickens today. The illustrations give us a glimpse of the characters as Dickens described them. Film makers still use the illustrations as a basis for characterisation, costume, and set design.

Often these characters were based on people he knew. In a few instances Dickens based the character too closely on the original, as in the case of Harold Skimpole in ''Bleak House'', based on Leigh Hunt, and Miss Mowcher in ''David Copperfield'', based on his wife's dwarf chiropodist.  Indeed, the acquaintances made when reading a Dickens novel are not easily forgotten. The author, [[Virginia Woolf]], maintained that &quot;we remodel our psychological geography when we read Dickens&quot; as he produces &quot;characters who exist not in detail, not accurately or exactly, but abundantly in a cluster of wild yet extraordinarily revealing remarks.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;The Essays of Virginia Woolf ed. by Andrew McNellie. Hogarth Press 1986&lt;/ref&gt;

===Autobiographical elements===
[[Image:Olivertwist cruikshank oliverasksformore.jpg|thumb|A color engraving from ''Oliver Twist'', by [[George Cruikshank]]]]
All authors might be said to incorporate autobiographical elements in their fiction, but with Dickens this is very noticeable, even though he took pains to mask what he considered his shameful, lowly past. ''David Copperfield'' is one of the most clearly autobiographical but the scenes from ''Bleak House'' of interminable court cases and legal arguments are drawn from the author's brief career as a court reporter. Dickens's  own father was sent to prison for debt, and this became a common theme in many of his books, with the detailed depiction of life in the Marshalsea prison in ''Little Dorrit'' resulting from Dickens's own experiences of the institution.  Childhood sweethearts in many of his books (such as Little Em'ly in ''David Copperfield'') may have been based on Dickens's own childhood infatuation with Lucy Stroughill.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=C0R86EscGyEC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA694#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Everybody in Dickens] by George Newlin&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=GyuH6-eZZaQC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=dickens%20and%20women&amp;pg=PA40#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Dickens and women] by Michael Slater&lt;/ref&gt;
Dickens may have drawn on his childhood experiences, but he was also ashamed of them and would not reveal that this was where he gathered his realistic accounts of squalor. Very few knew the details of his early life until six years after his death when John Forster published a biography on which Dickens had collaborated.

===Episodic writing===
As noted above, most of Dickens's major novels were first written in monthly or weekly installments in journals such as ''[[Master Humphrey's Clock]]'' and ''[[Household Words]]'', later reprinted in book form. These instalments made the stories cheap, accessible and the series of regular [[cliffhanger|cliff-hangers]] made each new episode widely anticipated. American fans even waited at the docks in New York, shouting out to the crew of an incoming ship, &quot;Is little Nell dead?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=HP-Time.com;Christopher Porterfield |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,944281,00.html |title=Boz Will Be Boz – TIME |publisher=TIME&lt;! |date=28 December 1970 |accessdate=24 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/06/27/1056683893671.html |title=A Dickens of a fuss – theage.com.au |publisher=Theage.com.au |date=29 June 2003 |accessdate=24 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/02/weekinreview/02mcgrath.html | work=The New York Times | title=And They All Died Happily Ever After | first=Charles | last=McGrath | date=2 July 2006 | accessdate=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part of Dickens's  great talent was to incorporate this episodic writing style but still end up with a coherent novel at the end. The monthly numbers were illustrated by, amongst others, &quot;[[Phiz]]&quot; (a pseudonym for [[Hablot Browne]]). Among his best-known works are ''Great Expectations'', ''David Copperfield'', ''Oliver Twist'', ''A Tale of Two Cities'', ''Bleak House'', ''Nicholas Nickleby'', ''The Pickwick Papers'', and ''A Christmas Carol''.
[[Image:Charles Dickens, public reading, 1867.jpg|left|thumb|&quot;Charles Dickens as he appears when reading.&quot; Wood engraving from ''[[Harper's Weekly]]'', 7 December 1867]]

Dickens's technique of writing in monthly or weekly instalments (depending on the work) can be understood by analysing his relationship with his [[illustrator]]s. The several artists who filled this role were privy to the contents and intentions of Dickens's  instalments before the general public. Thus, by reading these correspondences between author and illustrator, the intentions behind Dickens's  work can be better understood. These also reveal how the interests of the reader and author do not coincide. A great example of that appears in the monthly novel ''Oliver Twist''. At one point in this work, Dickens had Oliver become embroiled in a robbery. That particular monthly instalment concludes with young Oliver being shot. Readers expected that they would be forced to wait only a month to find out the outcome of that gunshot. In fact, Dickens did not reveal what became of young Oliver in the succeeding number. Rather, the reading public was forced to wait ''two'' months to discover if the boy lived.

Another important impact of Dickens's episodic writing style resulted from his exposure to the opinions of his readers. Since Dickens did not write the chapters very far ahead of their publication, he was allowed to witness the public reaction and alter the story depending on those public reactions. A fine example of this process can be seen in his weekly serial ''The Old Curiosity Shop'', which is a chase story. In this novel, Nell and her grandfather are fleeing the villain Quilp. The progress of the novel follows the gradual success of that pursuit. As Dickens wrote and published the weekly instalments, his friend John Forster pointed out: &quot;You know you're going to have to kill her, don't you?&quot; Why this end was necessary can be explained by a brief analysis of the difference between the structure of a comedy versus a tragedy. In a comedy, the action covers a sequence &quot;You think they're going to lose, you think they're going to lose, they win&quot;. In tragedy, it is: &quot;You think they're going to win, you think they're going to win, they lose&quot;. The dramatic conclusion of the story is implicit throughout the novel. So, as Dickens wrote the novel in the form of a tragedy, the sad outcome of the novel was a foregone conclusion. If he had not caused his heroine to lose, he would not have completed his dramatic structure. Dickens admitted that his friend Forster was right and, in the end, Nell died.&lt;ref&gt;Dickens, Charles. Harry Stone. ''Dickens' working notes for his novels''. University of Chicago Press ISBN 0226145905&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social commentary===
Dickens's  novels were, among other things, works of [[social commentary]]. He was a fierce critic of the [[poverty]] and [[social stratification]] of [[Victorian era|Victorian]] society. Dickens's  second novel, ''Oliver Twist'' (1839), shocked readers with its images of poverty and [[crime]] and was responsible for the clearing of the actual London [[Rookery (slum)|slum]], [[Jacob's Island]], that was the basis of the story. In addition, with the character of the tragic prostitute, [[Nancy (Oliver Twist)|Nancy]], Dickens &quot;humanised&quot; such women for the reading public; women who were regarded as &quot;unfortunates&quot;, inherently immoral casualties of the Victorian class/economic system. ''Bleak House'' and ''Little Dorrit'' elaborated expansive critiques of the Victorian institutional apparatus: the interminable lawsuits of the [[Court of Chancery]] that destroyed people's lives in ''Bleak House'' and a dual attack in ''Little Dorrit'' on inefficient, corrupt [[patent office]]s and unregulated market [[speculation]].

===Literary techniques===
[[Image:Stamp in The Centenary Edition of The Works of Charles Dickens in 36 Volumes. 36 vols. Chapman &amp; Hall, Ltd.- London (and Charles Scribner’s Son- New York), 1910-1912 rotated.jpg|thumb|Stamp in &quot;The Centenary Edition of The Works of Charles Dickens in 36 Volumes.&quot;]]
Dickens is often described as using 'idealised' characters and highly sentimental scenes to contrast with his [[caricature]]s and the ugly social truths he reveals. The story of Nell Trent in ''The Old Curiosity Shop'' (1841) was received as incredibly moving by contemporary readers but viewed as ludicrously sentimental by [[Oscar Wilde]].  &quot;You would need to have a heart of stone&quot;, he declared in one of his famous witticisms, &quot;not to laugh at the death of little Nell.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;In conversation with [[Ada Leverson]]. Quoted in Richard Ellmann, Oscar Wilde (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1988), p. 469.&lt;/ref&gt; (although her death actually takes place off-stage). In 1903 [[G. K. Chesterton]] said, &quot;It is not the death of little Nell, but the life of little Nell, that I object to.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[G. K. Chesterton]], ''Appreciations and Criticisms of the Works of Charles Dickens'', [http://www.readprint.com/chapter-1866/Gilbert-Keith-Chesterton Chapter 6: Curiosity Shop]&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Oliver Twist'' Dickens provides readers with an idealised portrait of a boy so inherently and unrealistically 'good' that his values are never subverted by either brutal orphanages or coerced involvement in a gang of young [[pickpocketing|pickpockets]]. While later novels also centre on idealised characters (Esther Summerson in ''Bleak House'' and Amy Dorrit in ''Little Dorrit''), this idealism serves only to highlight Dickens's  goal of poignant [[social commentary]]. Many of his novels are concerned with social realism, focusing on mechanisms of social control that direct people's lives (for instance, factory networks in ''Hard Times'' and hypocritical exclusionary class codes in ''Our Mutual Friend'').{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}Dickens also employs incredible coincidences (e.g., Oliver Twist turns out to be the lost nephew of the upper class family that randomly rescues him from the dangers of the pickpocket group). Such coincidences are a staple of eighteenth century [[picaresque novels]] such as Henry Fielding's ''[[The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling|Tom Jones]]'' that Dickens enjoyed so much. But, to Dickens, these were not just [[plot device]]s but an index of the humanism that led him to believe that good wins out in the end and often in unexpected ways.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

==Legacy==
[[Image:Dickens Statue.png|thumb|upright|Statue of Dickens in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania]]A well-known personality, his novels proved immensely popular during his lifetime. His first full novel, ''[[The Pickwick Papers]]'' (1837), brought him immediate fame, and this success continued throughout his career. Although rarely departing greatly from his typical &quot;Dickensian&quot; method of always attempting to write a great &quot;story&quot; in a somewhat conventional manner (the dual narrators of ''Bleak House'' constitute a notable exception), he experimented with varied themes, characterisations, and [[genre]]s. Some of these experiments achieved more popularity than others, and the public's taste and appreciation of his many works have varied over time. Usually keen to give his readers what they wanted, the monthly or weekly publication of his works in episodes meant that the books could change as the story proceeded at the whim of the public. Good examples of this are the American episodes in ''Martin Chuzzlewit'' which Dickens included in response to lower-than-normal sales of the earlier chapters.
Dickens continues to be one of the best known and most read of English authors, and his works have never gone [[Out-of-print book|out of print]].&lt;ref name=AHP/&gt; At least 180 motion pictures and TV adaptations based on Dickens's  works help confirm his success.&lt;ref&gt;{{imdb name|0002042|Charles Dickens as writer}} accessdate 2 June 2009 &lt;/ref&gt;  Many of his works were adapted for the stage during his own lifetime and as early as 1913 a silent film of ''The Pickwick Papers'' was made. His characters were often so memorable that they took on a life of their own outside his books. Gamp became a slang expression for an umbrella from the character [[Martin Chuzzlewit|Mrs. Gamp]] and Pickwickian, Pecksniffian, and Gradgrind all entered dictionaries due to Dickens's original portraits of such characters who were [[Quixotism|quixotic]], hypocritical, or emotionlessly logical. [[Sam Weller (fictional character)|Sam Weller]], the carefree and irreverent [[valet]] of ''The Pickwick Papers'', was an early superstar, perhaps better known than his author at first. It is likely that ''A Christmas Carol'' stands as his best-known story, with new adaptations almost every year. It is also the most-filmed of Dickens's  stories, with many versions dating from the early years of cinema. This simple [[morality play|morality tale]] with both [[pathos]] and its theme of redemption, sums up (for many) the true meaning of [[Christmas]]. Indeed, it eclipses all other [[Yule]]tide stories in not only popularity, but in adding archetypal figures (Scrooge, Tiny Tim, the Christmas ghosts) to the Western cultural consciousness. A prominent phrase from the tale, ''[[Holiday greetings#History of the phrase|'Merry Christmas']]'', was popularised following the appearance of the story.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson Cochrane.

[[Image:dickens-plaque-tavistock.jpg|left|thumb|180px|[[Blue plaque]] in [[Tavistock Square]], [[London]], commemorating Dickens and [[Tavistock House]]]]
At a time when Britain was the major economic and political power of the world, Dickens highlighted the life of the forgotten poor and disadvantaged at the heart of [[British Empire|empire]]. Through his journalism he campaigned on specific issues—such as [[sanitation]] and the [[workhouse]]—but his fiction probably demonstrated its greatest prowess in changing public opinion in regard to class inequalities. He often depicted the exploitation and repression of the poor and condemned the public officials and institutions that not only allowed such abuses to exist, but flourished as a result. His most strident indictment of this condition is in ''Hard Times'' (1854), Dickens's only novel-length treatment of the industrial working class. In this work, he uses both vitriol and satire to illustrate how this marginalised social stratum was termed &quot;Hands&quot; by the factory owners; that is, not really &quot;people&quot; but rather only appendages of the machines that they operated. His writings inspired others, in particular journalists and political figures, to address such problems of class oppression. For example, the prison scenes in ''The Pickwick Papers'' are claimed to have been influential in having the [[Fleet Prison]] shut down. As [[Karl Marx]] said, Dickens, and the other novelists of Victorian England, &quot;...issued to the world more political and social truths than have been uttered by all the professional politicians, publicists and moralists put together...&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Karl | last = Marx | title = The English Middle Classes | publisher = Marxists Internet Archive | work = [[New York Tribune]] | date = 1 August 1854 | url = http://marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1854/08/01.htm | accessdate = 10 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The exceptional popularity of his novels, even those with socially oppositional themes (''Bleak House'', 1853; ''Little Dorrit'', 1857; ''Our Mutual Friend'', 1865) underscored not only his almost preternatural ability to create compelling storylines and unforgettable characters, but also ensured that the Victorian public confronted issues of social justice that had commonly been ignored.

His fiction, with often vivid descriptions of life in nineteenth century England, has inaccurately and anachronistically come to symbolise on a global level Victorian society (1837&amp;nbsp;– 1901) as uniformly &quot;Dickensian&quot;, when in fact, his novels' time span spanned from the 1770s to the 1860s. In the decade following his death in 1870, a more intense degree of socially and philosophically pessimistic perspectives invested British fiction; such themes stood in marked contrast to the religious [[faith]] that ultimately held together even the bleakest of Dickens's  novels. Dickens clearly influenced later Victorian novelists such as [[Thomas Hardy]] and [[George Gissing]]; their works display a greater willingness to confront and challenge the Victorian institution of religion. They also portray characters caught up by social forces (primarily via [[lower-class]] conditions), but they usually steered them to tragic ends beyond their control.

Novelists continue to be influenced by his books; for instance, such disparate current writers as [[Anne Rice]], [[Tom Wolfe]], and [[John Irving]] evidence direct Dickensian connections. Humorist [[James Finn Garner]] even wrote a tongue-in-cheek &quot;politically correct&quot; version of ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'', and other affectionate parodies include the [[BBC Radio 4|Radio 4]] comedy ''[[Bleak Expectations]]''.   [[Matthew Pearl]]'s novel ''[[The Last Dickens]]'' is a thriller about how Charles Dickens would have ended ''[[The Mystery of Edwin Drood]]''. In the UK survey entitled ''[[The Big Read]]'' carried out by the [[BBC]] in 2003, five of Dickens' books were named in the [[The Big Read#Top 200 in the United Kingdom|Top 100]], featuring alongside [[Terry Pratchett]] with the most.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/bigread/top100.shtml The Big Read: Top 100 Books] ''[[BBC]]'' Retrieved 2 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Dickens's life has been the subject of at least two TV miniseries, a [[television film]] ''[[The Great Inimitable Mr. Dickens]]'' in which he was portrayed by [[Anthony Hopkins]], and two famous [[one-man show]]s, he has never been the subject of a [[Hollywood]] big screen biography.&lt;ref&gt;Pointer, Michael (1996) ''Charles Dickens on the screen: the film, television, and video adaptations'' p.202.

===Allegations of anti-Semitism and racism===
[[File:Fagin from Oliver Twist.JPG|right|thumb|220px|[[Fagin]] waits to be hanged.]]
Paul Vallely writes in ''The Independent'' that Dickens's Fagin in ''Oliver Twist'' —the Jew who runs a school in London for child pickpockets—is widely seen as one of the most grotesque Jews in English literature, and the most vivid of Dickens's 989 characters.&lt;ref name=Vallely&gt;Vallely, Paul. [http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/dickens-greatest-villain-the-faces-of-fagin-509906.html Dickens' greatest villain: The faces of Fagin], 7 October 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The mud lay thick upon the stones, and a black mist hung over the streets; the rain fell sluggishly down, and everything felt cold and clammy to the touch. It seemed just the night when it befitted such a being as the Jew to be abroad. As he glided stealthily along, creeping beneath the shelter of the walls and doorways, the hideous old man seemed like some loathsome reptile, engendered in the slime and darkness through which he moved, crawling forth by night in search of some rich offal for a meal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=ZXZaAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA17&amp;dq=Oliver+Twist#v=snippet&amp;q=The%20mud%20lay%20thick%20upon%20the%20stones&amp;f=false ''Oliver Twist''], Hurd and Houghton, 1867, chapter 19, pp. 221–222.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The character is thought to have been based on [[Ikey Solomon]], a 19th century Jewish criminal in London, who was interviewed by Dickens during the latter's time as a journalist.&lt;ref&gt;Rutland, Suzanne D. ''The Jews in Australia''. Cambridge University Press, 2005, p. 19. ISBN 9780521612852; Newey, Vincent. ''The Scriptures of Charles Dickens''.&lt;/ref&gt; Nadia Valdman, who writes about the portrayal of Jews in literature, argues that Fagin's representation was drawn from the image of the Jew as inherently evil, that the imagery associated him with the Devil, and with beasts.&lt;ref&gt;Valdman, Nadia. ''Antisemitism, A Historical Encyclopedia of Prejudice and Persecution''. ISBN 1-85109-439-3&lt;/ref&gt;

The novel refers to Fagin 257 times in the first 38 chapters as &quot;the Jew&quot;, while the ethnicity or religion of the other characters is not mentioned.&lt;ref name=Vallely/&gt; In 1854, the ''[[Jewish Chronicle]]'' asked why &quot;Jews alone should be excluded from the 'sympathizing heart' of this great author and powerful friend of the oppressed.&quot; Eliza Davis, whose husband had purchased Dickens's home in 1860 when he had put it up for sale, wrote to Dickens in protest at his portrayal of Fagin, arguing that he had &quot;encouraged a vile prejudice against the despised Hebrew&quot;, and that he had done a great wrong to the Jewish people. Dickens had described her husband at the time of the sale as a &quot;Jewish moneylender&quot;, though also someone he came to know as an honest gentleman.

Dickens took her complaint seriously. He halted the printing of ''Oliver Twist'', and changed the text for the parts of the book that had not been set, which is why Fagin is called &quot;the Jew&quot; 257 times in the first 38 chapters, but barely at all in the next 179 references to him. In his next novel, ''Our Mutual Friend'', he created the character of Riah (meaning &quot;friend&quot; in Hebrew), whose goodness, Vallely writes, is almost as complete as Fagin's evil. Riah says in the novel: &quot;Men say, 'This is a bad Greek, but there are good Greeks. This is a bad Turk, but there are good Turks.' Not so with the Jews ... they take the worst of us as samples of the best ...&quot; Davis sent Dickens a copy of the Hebrew bible in gratitude.&lt;ref name=Vallely/&gt;

His views on the [[Inuit]] are detailed in the [[Charles_Dickens#Franklin_incident|Franklin incident]] above. Dickens's attitudes towards blacks were also complex; Although he fiercely opposed the inhumanity of slavery in the United States, and expressed a desire for African American emancipation, he found it difficult to look upon them (in their present condition,at any rate) as equals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moore2004&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Grace Moore|title=Dickens and empire: discourses of class, race and colonialism in the works of Charles Dickens|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ZUxw0x84cGwC|accessdate=21 November 2010|date=28 November 2004|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|page=56|isbn=9780754634126}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''American Notes'', he includes a comic episode with a black coach driver, presenting a grotesque description focused on the man's dark complexion and way of movement, which to Dickens amounts to an &quot;insane imitation of an English coachman&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moore2004&quot; /&gt; In 1868, alluding to the then poor intellectual condition of the black population in America, Dickens railed against &quot;the mechanical absurdity of giving these people votes&quot;, which &quot;at any rate at present, would glare out of every roll of their eyes, chuckle in their mouths, and bump in their heads.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Moore2004&quot; /&gt;

==Names: 'Dickens' and 'Boz'==
[[File:Sketches by Boz illustrated by George Cruikshank 1837.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Frontispiece]], ''Sketches by Boz'', written by Dickens with illustrations by [[George Cruikshank]], 1837.]]
Charles Dickens had, as a contemporary critic put it, a &quot;queer name&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Unnamed writer|date=January 1849|title=The Haunted Man review|journal=Macphail's Edinburgh Ecclesiastical Journal|location=Edinburgh|volume=vi|pages=423|quote=Mr Dickens, as if in revenge for his own queer name, does bestow still queerer ones upon his fictitious creations.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name Dickens was used in interjective exclamations like &quot;What the Dickens!&quot; as a substitute for &quot;[[devil]]&quot;. It was recorded in the [[OED]] as originating from Shakespeare's ''[[The Merry Wives of Windsor]]''. It was also used as a substitute for &quot;[[deuce (disambiguation)|deuce]]&quot; as in the phrase &quot;to play the Dickens&quot; in the meaning &quot;to play havoc/mischief&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;John Bowen (2000) ''Other Dickens: Pickwick to Chuzzlewit'', ISBN 0199261407, [http://books.google.com/books?id=dAXP68lqcr0C&amp;pg=PA36&amp;dq=%22proverbial+name%22&amp;lr=&amp;sig=gp7fifHRJtj8zFvjjKGvvP16rYs#PPA36,M1 p. 36]&lt;/ref&gt;

'Boz' was Dickens' occasional [[pen-name]], but was a familiar name in the Dickens household long before Charles became a famous author. It was actually taken from his youngest brother [[Augustus Dickens]]' family [[nickname]] 'Moses', given to him in honour of one of the brothers in ''[[The Vicar of Wakefield]]'' (one of the most widely read novels during the early 19th century). When playfully pronounced through the nose 'Moses' became 'Boses', and was later shortened to 'Boz' – pronounced through the nose with a [[long vowel]] 'o'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9801EED7123DE433A2575AC1A9649C94649ED7CF &quot;Augustus Dickens&quot;] in ''[[Daily Herald (Arlington Heights)|The Chicago Herald]]'', 19 February 1895&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptations of readings==
There have been several performances of Dickens readings by [[Emlyn Williams]], Bransby Williams, [[Clive Francis]] performing the [[John Mortimer]] adaptation of ''A Christmas Carol'' and also [[Simon Callow]] in the ''Mystery of Charles Dickens'' by [[Peter Ackroyd]]. Entertainer [[Mike Randall (entertainer)|Mike Randall]] re-enacts Dickens's readings (in character as Dickens) for a series of shows known as &quot;Charles Dickens Presents A Christmas Carol,&quot; primarily in his home region in [[Western New York]].

==Museums and festivals==
[[Image:Bleak-house-broadstairs.jpg|thumb|[[Bleak House, Broadstairs|Bleak House]] in [[Broadstairs]], Kent, where Dickens wrote some of his novels]]

There are museums and festivals celebrating Dickens's life and works in many of the towns with which he was associated.
* The [[Charles Dickens Museum, London|Charles Dickens Museum]], in Doughty Street, [[Holborn]] is the only one of Dickens's London homes to survive. He lived there only two years but in that time wrote ''The Pickwick Papers'', ''Oliver Twist'' and ''Nicholas Nickleby''. It contains a major collection of manuscripts, original furniture and memorabilia.
* Charles Dickens Birthplace Museum in Portsmouth is the house in which Dickens was born. It has been re-furnished in the likely style of 1812 and contains Dickens memorabilia.
* The Dickens House Museum in [[Broadstairs]], Kent is the house of Miss Mary Pearson Strong, the basis for Miss [[Betsey Trotwood]] in ''David Copperfield''. It is visible across the bay from the original Bleak House (also a museum until 2005) where ''David Copperfield'' was written. The museum contains memorabilia, general Victoriana and some of Dickens's letters. Broadstairs has held a '''Dickens Festival''' annually since 1937.
* The Charles Dickens Centre in Eastgate House, [[Rochester, Kent|Rochester]], closed in 2004, but the garden containing the author's Swiss [[chalet]] is still open. The 16th century house, which appeared as Westgate House in ''The Pickwick Papers'' and the Nun's House in ''Edwin Drood'', is now used as a wedding venue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medway.gov.uk/index/community/weddings/weddingvenues/50362.htm |title=Medway Council – Eastgate House |publisher=Medway.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=24 July 2009}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city's annual '''Dickens Festival''' (summer) and '''Dickensian Christmas''' celebrations continue unaffected. ''Summer Dickens'' is held at the end of May or in the first few days of June, it commences with an invitation only ball on the Thursday and then continues with street entertainment, and many costumed characters, on the Friday, Saturday and Sunday. ''Christmas Dickens'' is the first weekend in December- Saturday and Sunday only.
* [[Dickens World]] themed attraction, covering {{convert|71500|sqft|m2|0}}, and including a cinema and restaurants, opened in [[Chatham, Kent|Chatham]] on 25 May 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Christopher | last = Hart | title = What, the Dickens World? | publisher =Times Online | work = The Sunday Times | date = 20 May 2007 | url=http://travel.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/travel/holiday_type/family/article1803247.ece |accessdate=2 June 2007  | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; It stands on a small part of the site of the former [[Chatham Dockyard|naval dockyard]] where Dickens's father had once worked in the Navy Pay Office.

Dickens festivals are also held across the world. Four notable ones in the United States are:
* The Riverside Dickens Festival in [[Riverside, California|Riverside]], California, includes literary studies as well as entertainments.
* The Great Dickens Christmas Fair has been held in San Francisco, California, since the 1970s. During the four or five weekends before Christmas, over 500 costumed performers mingle with and entertain thousands of visitors amidst the recreated full-scale blocks of Dickensian London in over {{convert|90000|sqft|m2|-3}} of public area. This is the oldest, largest, and most successful of the modern Dickens festivals outside England. Many (including the Martin Harris who acts in the Rochester festival and flies out from London to play Scrooge every year in SF) say it is the most impressive in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dickensfair.com/&gt; '''The Great Dickens Christmas Fair''' San Francisco]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Dickens on The Strand in [[Galveston, Texas|Galveston]], Texas, is a holiday festival held on the first weekend in December since 1974, where bobbies, Beefeaters and the &quot;Queen&quot; herself are on hand to recreate the Victorian London of Charles Dickens. Many festival volunteers and attendees dress in Victorian attire and bring the world of Dickens to life.
* The Greater Port Jefferson-Northern Brookhaven Arts Council &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gpjac.org The Greater Port Jefferson-Northern Brookhaven Arts Counci]&lt;/ref&gt; holds a Dickens Festival in the Village of [[Port Jefferson, New York|Port Jefferson]], New York each year. In 2009, the Dickens Festival was 4 December, 5 December and 6 December. It includes many events, along with a troupe of street performers who bring an authentic Dickensian atmosphere to the town.

==Other memorials==
Charles Dickens was commemorated on the Series E £10 note issued by the [[Bank of England note issues|Bank of England]] which was in circulation in the UK between 1992 and 2003. Dickens appeared on the reverse of the note accompanied by a scene from ''The Pickwick Papers''.&lt;ref name=&quot;banknote&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/banknotes/denom_guide/index.htm|title=Withdrawn banknotes reference guide|publisher=Bank of England|accessdate=17 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:HMS Carabiner.png|right|thumb|A screw lock &quot;pear&quot; shaped carabiner]]

A '''carabiner''' ({{IPAc-en|k|ær|ə|ˈ|b|iː|n|ər}}) or '''karabiner''' is a metal loop with a sprung or screwed gate&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mountaindays.net/content/articles/dictionary.php#karabiner |title=Climbing Dictionary &amp; Glossary |publisher=MountainDays.net |accessdate=2006-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; that is used to quickly and reversibly connect components in safety-critical systems. The word comes from &quot;Karabinerhaken&quot;, meaning &quot;hook for a [[carbine]]&quot; in [[German language|German]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bartleby.com/61/53/C0095300.html |title=The American Heritage Dictionary: carabiner |publisher=Bartleby |accessdate=2006-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use==
Carabiners are widely used in rope-intensive activities such as [[climbing]], [[caving]], [[sailing]], [[construction]], and window cleaning. Carabiners used in sports tend to be of a lighter weight than those used in [[industrial rope access|industrial rope work]] and [[rope rescue]]. Carabiners can be made from [[steel]] or [[aluminium]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

==Physical properties==
===Locking mechanisms===
[[Image:Assorted Biners.jpg|right|thumb|Clockwise from top left: D-shape wire gate, D-shape straight gate, Oval straight gate, Auto-lock, Screw-lock. Center is a standard carabiner rating.]]
There are two broad categories of carabiner, locking and non-locking.

====Non-locking====
Non-locking carabiners have a sprung swinging gate that accepts a rope, webbing sling, or other hardware. Mountaineers frequently connect two non-locking carabiners with a short length of nylon web to create a [[quickdraw]].

Three gate types are common:

*'''Straight gate:''' The most utilitarian, and hence most popular.

*'''Bent gate:''' Curved gates allow for easier clipping in and out in special situations, such as connecting a rope to a quickdraw. Gate strength remains on a par with straight-gate carabiners.

*'''Wire gate:''' The lightest type, with a gate generally equal to the others, allowing more to be carried for a given load. Wire gates are less prone to icing up than solid gates, an advantage in Alpine mountaineering and ice climbing. The reduced gate mass makes their wire bales less prone to 'gate flutter,' a dangerous condition potentially allowing a rope to escape created by irregular impact forces generated by the rope itself or contact with hard surfaces in a fall.

====Locking====
Locking carabiners have the same general shape as non-locking carabiners but have an additional sleeve securing the gate. These sleeves may be either threaded or spring-loaded twist-lock.

*'''Twist-lock:''' May either be manually engaged or auto-locking. Auto-locking offer the advantage of engaging without user input. Being spring-loaded either type is prone to spring fatigue or their mechanisms becoming balky from dirt, ice, or other contamination. They are also difficult to engage one-handed.

*'''Screw-lock:''' Are threaded and must be engaged and disengaged manually. Fewer moving parts than spring-loaded mechanisms, less prone to malfunctioning, easier to employ one-handed. More effort and more time-consuming.

===Shape===
Carabiners come in four characteristic shapes:

*'''Oval:''' Symmetric. Most basic and utilitarian, also the least expensive. Smooth regular curves are gentle on equipment and allow easy repositioning of loads. Their greatest disadvantage is that a load is shared equally on both the strong solid spine and the weaker gated axis.

*'''D:''' Asymmetric shape transfers the majority of their load onto the spine, the carabiner's strongest axis. Slightly more expensive.

*'''Offset-D:''' Variant of a D with a greater assymmetry, allowing for a wider gate opening. More expensive yet.

*'''Pear/HMS:''' Specialized oversized offset-D's used in [[belay]]ing. Most expensive and heaviest carabiner. Essential when using a [[Munter hitch]].

==Certification==
===Europe===
*'''Recreation:''' Carabiners sold for use in climbing in Europe must conform to standard EN 12275:1998 &quot;Mountaineering equipment - Connectors - Safety requirements and test methods,&quot; which governs testing protocols, rated strengths, and markings. A breaking stress of at least 20 [[kilonewton|kN]] (20,000 newtons = approximately 4,500 pounds of force which is significantly more than the weight of a small car) with the gate closed and 7 [[kilonewton|kN]] with the gate open is the standard for most climbing applications, although requirements vary depending on the activity.[http://www.paci.com.au/Downloads/S-EN12275_simplified.pdf]
Carabiners are marked on the side with single letters showing their intended area of use, for example, K ([[via ferrata]]), B (base), and H (for belaying with an Italian or [[Munter hitch]]).

*'''Industry:''' Carabiners used for access in commercial and industrial environments within Europe must comply with EN 362:2004 &quot;Personal protective equipment against falls from a height. Connectors.&quot; The minimum gate closed breaking strain of a carabiner conforming with EN 362:2004 is nominally the same as that of EN 12275:1998 at around 20 [[kilonewton|kN]]. However, the gate open requirement is higher at 15 [[kilonewton|kN]]. Carabiners complying with both EN 12275:1998 and EN 362:2004 are available.

===United States===
*'''Fall protection:''' Carabiners use for fall protection in US industry are classified as &quot;connectors&quot; and are required to meet [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] standard 1910.66 App C ''Personal Fall Arrest System'' which specifies &quot;drop forged, pressed or formed steel&quot; construction and a minimum breaking strength of 5000&amp;nbsp;lbs.

[[American National Standards Institute]]/[[American Society of Safety Engineers]] standard Z359.1-2007 ''Safety Requirement for Personal Fall Arrest Systems, Subsystems and Components'', section 3.2.1.4 (for snap hooks and carabiners) is a voluntary consensus standard.

*'''Rescue:''' Minimum [[breaking strength]] requirements and calculations for rescue carabiners are set out in [[National Fire Protection Association]] standard 1983 ''Fire Service Life Safety Rope and Equipment''. The standard defines two classes of rescue carabiners. Light use rescue carabiners are required to have minimum breaking stengths of 27&amp;nbsp;kN gate closed, 7&amp;nbsp;kN gate open and 7&amp;nbsp;kN minor axis. General use rescue carabiners are required to have minimum breaking stengths of 40&amp;nbsp;kN gate closed, 11&amp;nbsp;kN gate open and 11&amp;nbsp;kN minor axis. Testing procedures for rescue carabiners are set out in [[ASTM International]] standard F 1956 ''Standard Specification of Rescue Carabiners''.

In [[fiction]], '''continuity''' (also called '''time-scheme''') is consistency of the characteristics of persons, [[plot (narrative)|plot]], objects, places and events seen by the reader or viewer over some period of time. It is of relevance to several [[mass media|media]].

Continuity is particularly a concern in the production of [[film]] and [[television]] due to the difficulty of rectifying an error in continuity after shooting has wrapped up. It also applies to other art forms, including [[novel]]s, [[comic]]s, [[anime]], [[videogames]] and [[animation]], though usually on a smaller scale. 

Most productions have a [[script supervisor]] on hand whose job is to pay attention to and attempt to maintain continuity across the chaotic and typically non-linear production shoot. This takes the form of a large amount of paperwork, photographs, and attention to and memory of large quantities of detail, some of which is sometimes assembled into the [[Bible (writing)|story bible]] for the production.  It usually regards factors both within the scene and often even technical details including meticulous records of camera positioning and equipment settings. The use of a [[Polaroid camera]] was standard but has since been replaced by the advent of [[digital camera]]s.  All of this is done so that ideally all related shots can match, despite perhaps parts being shot thousands of miles and several months apart. It is a less conspicuous job, though, because if done perfectly, no one will ever notice.

In [[comic books]], continuity has also come to mean a set of contiguous events, sometimes said to be &quot;set in the same universe&quot; (see [[fictional crossover]] and [[fictional universe]]) or &quot;separate universes&quot; (see [[intercompany crossover]]).

Today, maintaining strong plot and character continuity is also a high priority for many writers of long-running television series. 

==Continuity errors==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Futurama]] --&gt;
Whilst most continuity errors are subtle, such as changes in the level of drink in a character's glass or the length of a cigarette, others can be more noticeable, such as sudden drastic changes in appearance of a character. Such errors in continuity can ruin the illusion of realism and affect [[suspension of disbelief]].

In [[Film|cinema]], special attention must be paid to continuity because films are rarely shot in the order in which they are presented. The shooting schedule is often dictated by location permit issues. A character may return to [[Times Square]] in [[New York City]] several times throughout a movie, but as it is extraordinarily expensive to close off Times Square, those scenes will likely be filmed all at once in order to reduce permit costs. Weather, the ambience of natural light, cast and crew availability, or any number of other circumstances can also influence a shooting schedule.  

===Editing errors===
Editing errors can occur when a character in a scene references a scene or incident that has not occurred yet, or of which they should not yet be aware.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}  

An example of an editing error can be seen in the film ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]'' (1963), where a scene of people climbing a slope at the start is seen from below and then replayed from above.

===Visual errors===
Visual errors are instant ''discontinuities'' occurring in visual media such as [[film]] and [[television]].  Items of clothing change colors, shadows get longer or shorter, items within a scene change place or disappear, etc.

One example of a ''visual error'' occurs in the [[1998 in film|1998]] film ''[[Waking Ned]]'', when two of the film's characters, Jackie and Michael, are walking through a storm towards Ned's house.  The umbrella they are under is black during their conversation as they walk towards the house (filmed from slightly above and to the front); yet after cutting to a lower shot (filmed from behind Jackie), Michael walks onscreen from the right holding an umbrella that is not black but beige, with a brown band at the rim.

Though visual continuity errors are logically confined to visual media, parallel mistakes can occur in text.  In &quot;[[The Miller's Prologue and Tale|The Miller's Tale]]&quot; in [[Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'' a door is ripped off its hinges only to be slowly closed again in the next scene.

===Plot errors===
Plot errors reflect a failure in the consistency of the created fictional world. A character might state he was an only child, yet later mention a sibling. In the TV show ''[[Cheers]]'', Frasier Crane's wife Lilith mentions Frasier's parents are both dead. When the character was spun off into ''[[Frasier]]'' his father became a central character with, in a case of [[retroactive continuity]], the explanation that Frasier was embarrassed about his father's lowbrow attitudes and thus claimed his death.

====Aging discrepancies====
The practice of accelerating the age of a television character (usually a child or teenager) in conflict with the timeline of a series and/or the real-world progression of time is popularly known as [[Soap Opera Rapid Aging Syndrome]], or SORAS.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rising Stars&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tonight.co.za/index.php?fArticleId=3215940&amp;fSectionId=434&amp;fSetId=204 |title=Soaps' rising stars |first=Kim |last=Clayton-Millar |date=April 24, 2006 |work=Tonight |publisher=Independent News &amp; Media |accessdate=December 17, 2009-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Children unseen on screen for a time might reappear portrayed by an actor several years older than the original.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bird |first1=S. Elizabeth  |title=The Audience in Everyday Life: Living in a Media World |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=JtkAqUHwtrIC&amp;pg=PA135&amp;lpg=PA135&amp;dq=%22soap+opera+sudden+aging+syndrome%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=IrVYVYSWxl&amp;sig=dKEAjt43NsvvEgea73UF-lIt1zw&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=V0sjS6SHCIj-nAeZ9JzuCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CAsQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22soap%20opera%20sudden%20aging%20syndrome%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=December 12, 2009 |year=2003 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |isbn=0415942594 |page=135 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually coinciding with a recast, this rapid aging is typically done to open up the character to a wider range of storylines, and to attract younger viewers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rising Stars&quot;/&gt;

==Dealing with errors==
When continuity mistakes have been made, explanations are often proposed by either writers or fans to smooth over discrepancies. Fans sometimes make up explanations for such errors that may or may not be integrated into [[canon (fiction)|canon]]; this has come to be colloquially known as fanwanking.  Often when a fan does not agree with one of the events in a story (such as the death of a favorite character) they will choose to ignore the event in question so that their enjoyment of the franchise is not diminished. When the holder of the intellectual property discards all existing continuity and starts from scratch it is known as [[reboot (continuity)|rebooting]].  Fans call a less extreme literary technique that erases one episode the [[reset button technique|reset button]]. 

Discrepancies in past continuity are sometimes made deliberately; this is known as [[retcon]]ning. Retcons are also sometimes used to either correct or cover up a perceived error. These changes may be made either by the same writer who made it, or more commonly by an author that has taken over the creative lead of a corporate owned show or publication.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}.
Not to be confused with the continuance of a reality (continuality).

==Real time programs vs traditional films==
[[Television program]]s like ''[[24 (television)|24]]'', in which actors have to appear as if it is the same day for 24 consecutive episodes, have raised public recognition of continuity. However, traditional films have frequently had much of the same sort of the issues to deal with; film shoots may last several months and as scenes are frequently shot out of story sequence, footage shot weeks apart may be edited together as part of the same day's action in the completed film. In some ways, ''24'' presents a simpler situation, as costumes and hairstyles generally should ''not'' change very frequently; in many feature films a range of different hairstyles and costumes must be created, changed, and then recreated exactly, as various scenes are shot.

==Early example==

One of the earliest continuity errors appears in [[Charlie Chaplin]]'s &quot;[[The Property Man]]&quot; of 1914. Here, in a supposedly smooth step from one room to another, (carrying a heavy chest) Charlie loses his hat in one room then it is instantly back on his head as he goes into the next room.

Rather &quot;loose&quot; plots and a lack of continuity editing made most early films rife with such errors.

{{Capital punishment}}
'''Capital punishment''', the '''death penalty''', or '''execution''' is the sentence of death upon a person by [[procedural law|judicial process]] as a punishment for an offence. Crimes that can result in a death penalty are known as ''capital crimes'' or ''capital offences''. The term ''capital'' originates from the [[Latin]] ''capitalis'', literally &quot;regarding the head&quot;. Hence a capital crime was originally one punished by [[Decapitation|severing the head]] from the body.&lt;ref name=KronenwetterP202&gt;{{Harvnb|Kronenwetter|2001|p=202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Capital punishment has in the past been practiced in virtually every society, although currently only 58 nations actively practice it, with 95 countries having abolished it (the remainder having not used it for 10 years or allowing it only in exceptional circumstances such as wartime).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amnesty.org/en/death-penalty/abolitionist-and-retentionist-countries |title=Abolitionist and retentionist countries &amp;#124; Amnesty International |publisher=Amnesty.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a matter of active controversy in various countries and states, and positions can vary within a single [[political ideology]] or cultural region. In the [[European Union]] member states, Article 2 of the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union]] prohibits the use of capital punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/charter/pdf/text_en.pdf |title=Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Execution of [[Crime|criminal]]s and political opponents has been used by nearly all societies—both to punish crime and to suppress [[political dissent]]. In most places that practice capital punishment it is reserved for [[murder]], [[espionage]], [[treason]], or as part of [[military justice]]. In some countries sexual crimes, such as [[rape]], [[adultery]], [[incest]] and [[sodomy]], carry the death penalty, as do religious crimes such as [[apostasy]] in [[Islamic]] nations (the formal renunciation of the [[state religion]]). In many [[Use of capital punishment by nation|countries that use the death penalty]], [[drug trafficking]] is also a capital offense. In China, [[Trafficking in human beings|human trafficking]] and serious cases of [[Political corruption|corruption]] are punished by the death penalty. In militaries around the world [[courts-martial]] have imposed death sentences for offenses such as [[cowardice]], [[desertion]], [[insubordination]], and [[mutiny]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shotatdawn.org.uk/ |title= Shot at Dawn, campaign for pardons for British and Commonwealth soldiers executed in World War I|accessdate= 2006-07-20|publisher= Shot at Dawn Pardons Campaign}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of formal execution extends to the beginning of recorded history. Most historical records and various primitive tribal practices indicate that the death penalty was a part of their justice system. Communal punishment for wrongdoing generally included compensation by the wrongdoer, [[corporal punishment]], [[shunning]], [[exile|banishment]] and execution. Usually, compensation and shunning were enough as a form of justice.&lt;ref&gt;So common was the practice of compensation that the word ''[[murder]]'' is derived from the French word ''mordre'' (bite) a reference to the heavy compensation one must pay for causing an unjust death. The &quot;bite&quot; one had to pay was used as a term for the crime itself: &quot;Mordre wol out; that se we day by day.&quot; – [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] (1340–1400), [[The Canterbury Tales]], ''The Nun's Priest's Tale,'' l. 4242 (1387–1400), repr. In ''The Works of Geoffrey Chaucer'', ed. Alfred W. Pollard, et al. (1898).&lt;/ref&gt; The response to crime committed by neighbouring tribes or communities included formal apology, compensation or blood [[feud]]s.

A [[Feud|blood feud]] or [[Feud|vendetta]] occurs when arbitration between families or tribes fails or an arbitration system is non-existent. This form of justice was common before the emergence of an arbitration system based on state or organised religion. It may result from crime, land disputes or a code of honour. &quot;Acts of retaliation underscore the ability of the social collective to defend itself and demonstrate to enemies (as well as potential allies) that injury to property, rights, or the person will not go unpunished.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Translated from Waldmann, ''op.cit.'', p.147.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in practice, it is often difficult to distinguish between a [[war]] of vendetta and one of conquest.

Severe historical penalties include [[breaking wheel]], [[boiling to death]], [[flaying]], [[slow slicing]], [[disembowelment]], [[crucifixion]], [[impalement]], [[crushing]] (including [[crushing by elephant]]), [[stoning]], [[execution by burning]], [[dismemberment]], [[sawing (torture)|sawing]], [[decapitation]], [[scaphism]], [[necklacing]] or [[blowing from a gun]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.info-sikh.com/PagePeace1.html |title=India non violence |publisher=Info-sikh.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:The Christian Martyrs Last Prayer.jpg|thumb|left|''The Christian Martyrs' Last Prayer'', by [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]] (1883). [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[Colosseum]].]]
Elaborations of tribal arbitration of [[feud]]s included peace settlements often done in a religious context and compensation system. Compensation was based on the principle of ''substitution'' which might include material (for example, cattle, slave) compensation, exchange of brides or grooms, or payment of the blood debt. Settlement rules could allow for animal blood to replace human blood, or transfers of property or [[Blood money (term)|blood money]] or in some case an offer of a person for execution. The person offered for execution did not have to be an original perpetrator of the crime because the system was based on tribes, not individuals. Blood feuds could be regulated at meetings, such as the [[Viking]] ''[[Thing (assembly)|thing]]s''.&lt;ref&gt;Lindow, ''op.cit.'' (primarily discusses Icelandic ''things'').&lt;/ref&gt; Systems deriving from blood feuds may survive alongside more advanced legal systems or be given recognition by courts (for example, [[trial by combat]]). One of the more modern refinements of the blood feud is the [[duel]].

[[Vatican City]] abolished [[Capital punishment in Vatican City|its capital punishment statute]] in 1969.]]
In certain parts of the world, nations in the form of ancient republics, monarchies or tribal oligarchies emerged. These nations were often united by common linguistic, religious or family ties. Moreover, expansion of these nations often occurred by conquest of neighbouring tribes or nations. Consequently, various classes of royalty, nobility, various commoners and slave emerged. Accordingly, the systems of tribal arbitration were submerged into a more unified system of justice which formalised the relation between the different &quot;classes&quot; rather than &quot;tribes&quot;. The earliest and most famous example is [[Code of Hammurabi]] which set the different punishment and compensation according to the different class/group of victims and perpetrators. The [[Torah]] (Jewish Law), also known as the [[Pentateuch]] (the first five books of the Christian [[Old Testament]]), lays down the death penalty for murder, [[kidnapping]], [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]], violation of the [[Shabbat|Sabbath]], [[blasphemy]], and a wide range of sexual crimes, although evidence suggests that actual executions were rare.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| first=William | last=Schabas | year= 2002| title=The Abolition of the Death Penalty in International Law | chapter= | editor= | others= | pages= | publisher=Cambridge University Press | isbn=0-521-81491-X| url= | authorlink= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A further example comes from [[Ancient Greece]], where the [[Athenian]] legal system was first written down by [[Draco (lawgiver)|Draco]] in about 621 BC: the death penalty was applied for a particularly wide range of crimes, though [[Solon]] later repealed Draco's code and published new laws, retaining only Draco's homicide statutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Robert |url=http://history-world.org/draco_and_solon_laws.htm |title=Greece, A History of Ancient Greece, Draco and Solon Laws |publisher=History-world.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word [[wikt:draconian|draconian]] derives from Draco's laws. The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] also used death penalty for a wide range of offenses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/93902/capital-punishment capital punishment], Encyclopædia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.allexperts.com/q/Asian-Middle-Eastern-671/Capital-punishment-Ancient-Rome.htm |title=Capital punishment in the Roman Empire |publisher=En.allexperts.com |date=2001-01-30 |accessdate=2010-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Islam]] on the whole accepts capital punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/islamethics/capitalpunishment.shtml |title=Islam and capital punishment |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Abbasid]] [[Caliph]]s in [[Baghdad]], such as [[Al-Mu'tadid]], were often cruel in their punishments.&lt;ref&gt;''The Caliphate: Its Rise, Decline, and Fall.'', [[William Muir]]&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'', also known as the ''Arabian Nights'', the fictional storyteller [[Sheherazade]] is portrayed as being the &quot;voice of [[sanity]] and [[mercy]]&quot;, with her [[Islamic philosophy|philosophical position]] being generally opposed to punishment by death. She expresses this through several of her tales, including &quot;The Merchant and the Jinni&quot;, &quot;[[The Fisherman and the Jinni]]&quot;, &quot;[[The Three Apples]]&quot;, and &quot;The Hunchback&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=When Dreams Came True: Classical Fairy Tales and Their Tradition|first=Jack David|last=Zipes|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=1999|isbn=0415921511|pages=57–8|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Lamanie kolem L 001xx.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The [[breaking wheel]] was used during the Middle Ages and was still in use into the 19th century.]]
Similarly, in [[Middle Age|medieval]] and early modern Europe, before the development of modern [[prison]] systems, the death penalty was also used as a generalised form of punishment. During the reign of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], as many as 72,000 people are estimated to have been executed.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/execution/readings/history.html History of the Death Penalty]&quot;. Public Broadcasting Service (PBS).&lt;/ref&gt; In 18th-century Britain there were 222 crimes that were punishable by death, including crimes such as cutting down a tree or stealing an animal.&lt;ref&gt;Almost invariably, however, sentences of death for property crimes were commuted to transportation to a [[penal colony]] or to a place where the felon was worked as an indentured servant/[http://web.archive.org/web/20060304025843/http://teacher.deathpenaltyinfo.msu.edu/c/about/history/history.PDF Michigan State University and Death Penalty Information Center]&lt;/ref&gt; Thanks to the notorious [[Bloody Code]], 18th-century (and early 19th-century) Britain was a hazardous place to live. For example, Michael Hammond and his sister, Ann, whose ages were given as 7 and 11, were reportedly hanged at [[King's Lynn]] on Wednesday, September 28, 1708 for theft. The local press did not, however, consider the executions of two children newsworthy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20070127162456/http://www.richard.clark32.btinternet.co.uk/hanging1.html History of British judicial hanging]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although many are executed in China each year in the present day, there was a time in [[Tang Dynasty]] China when the death penalty was abolished.&lt;ref name=&quot;benn 8&quot;&gt;Benn, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; This was in the year 747, enacted by [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang]] (r. 712–756). When abolishing the death penalty Xuanzong ordered his officials to refer to the nearest regulation by analogy when sentencing those found guilty of crimes for which the prescribed punishment was execution. Thus depending on the severity of the crime a punishment of severe scourging with the thick rod or of exile to the remote [[Lingnan region]] might take the place of capital punishment. However the death penalty was restored only 12 years later in 759 in response to the [[An Lushan Rebellion]].&lt;ref&gt;Benn, pp. 209–210&lt;/ref&gt; At this time in China only the emperor had the authority to sentence criminals to execution. Under [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang|Xuanzong]] capital punishment was relatively infrequent, with only 24 executions in the year 730 and 58 executions in the year 736.&lt;ref name=&quot;benn 8&quot;/&gt;
[[File:Lingchi (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|Ling Chi – execution by [[slow slicing]] – in Beijing around 1910.]]
The two most common forms of execution in China in the Tang period were strangulation and decapitation, which were the prescribed methods of execution for 144 and 89 offenses respectively. Strangulation was the prescribed sentence for lodging an accusation against one's parents or grandparents with a magistrate, scheming to kidnap a person and sell them into slavery and opening a coffin while desecrating a tomb. Decapitation was the method of execution prescribed for more serious crimes such as treason and sedition. Interestingly, and despite the great discomfort involved, most Chinese during the Tang preferred strangulation to decaptitation, as a result of the traditional Chinese belief that the body is a gift from the parents and that it is therefore disrespectful to one's ancestors to die without returning one's body to the grave intact.

Some further forms of capital punishment were practiced in Tang China, of which the first two that follow at least were extralegal. The first of these was scourging to death with the thick rod which was common throughout the Tang especially in cases of gross corruption. The second was truncation, in which the convicted person was cut in two at the waist with a fodder knife and then left to bleed to death.&lt;ref name=Benn210&gt;Benn, p. 210&lt;/ref&gt; A further form of execution called Ling Chi ([[slow slicing]]), or death by/of a thousand cuts, was used in China from the close of the Tang dynasty in roughly 900 CE to its abolition in 1905.

When a minister of the fifth grade or above received a death sentence the emperor might grant him a special dispensation allowing him to commit suicide in lieu of execution. Even when this privilege was not granted, the law required that the condemned minister be provided with food and ale by his keepers and transported to the execution ground in a cart rather than having to walk there.

Nearly all executions under the Tang took place in public as a warning to the population. The heads of the executed were displayed on poles or spears. When local authorities decapitated a convicted criminal, the head was boxed and sent to the capital as proof of identity and that the execution had taken place.

In Tang China, when a person was sentenced to decapitation for rebellion or sedition, punishment was also imposed on their relatives, whether or not the relatives were guilty of participation in the crime. In such cases fathers of the convicted under 79 years of age and sons aged over 15 were strangled. Sons under 15, daughters, mothers, wives, concubines, grandfathers, grandsons, brothers and sisters were enslaved and uncles and nephews were banished to the remotest reaches of the empire. Sometimes the tombs of the family's ancestors were levelled, the ancestors' coffins were destroyed and their bones scattered.&lt;ref name=Benn210 /&gt;

[[File:Mexican execution, 1914.jpg|left|thumb|Mexican execution by firing squad, 1916]]
Despite its wide use, calls for reform were not unknown. The 12th century [[Sephardic]] legal scholar, Moses [[Maimonides]], wrote, &quot;It is better and more satisfactory to acquit a thousand guilty persons than to put a single innocent man to death.&quot; He argued that executing an accused criminal on anything less than absolute certainty would lead to a slippery slope of decreasing [[Legal burden of proof|burdens of proof]], until we would be convicting merely &quot;according to the judge's caprice.&quot; His concern was maintaining popular respect for law, and he saw errors of commission as much more threatening than errors of omission.

The last several centuries have seen the emergence of modern nation-states. Almost fundamental to the concept of nation state is the idea of [[citizenship]]. This caused justice to be increasingly associated with equality and universality, which in Europe saw an emergence of the concept of [[natural right]]s. Another important aspect is that emergence of standing police forces and permanent penitential institutions. The death penalty became an increasingly unnecessary [[deterrence (legal)|deterrent]] in prevention of minor crimes such as theft. The argument that deterrence, rather than retribution, is the main justification for punishment is a hallmark of the [[Rational choice theory (criminology)|rational choice theory]] and can be traced to [[Cesare, Marquis of Beccaria|Cesare Beccaria]] whose well-known treatise [[Dei delitti e delle pene|''On Crimes and Punishments'']] (1764), condemned [[torture]] and the [[death penalty]] and [[Jeremy Bentham]] who twice critiqued the death penalty.&lt;ref name=&quot;deathpenalty&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.2307/1143143|author1=Bedau, Hugo Adam|title=Bentham's Utilitarian Critique of the Death Penalty|url=http://www.jstor.org/pss/1143143| journal=The Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology | volume = 74| issue =  3 |date=Autumn 1983 |pages= 1033–1065|publisher=[[Northwestern University School of Law]]|accessdate=2008-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, in countries like Britain, law enforcement officials became alarmed when juries tended to acquit non-violent felons rather than risk a conviction that could result in execution.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Moving executions there inside prisons and away from public view was prompted by official recognition of the phenomenon reported first by Beccaria in Italy and later by [[Charles Dickens]] and [[Karl Marx]] of increased violent criminality at the times and places of executions.

The 20th century was one of the bloodiest of the human history. Massive killing occurred as the resolution of war between nation-states. A large part of execution was summary execution of enemy combatants. Also, modern military organisations employed capital punishment as a means of maintaining military discipline. The Soviets, for example, executed 158,000 soldiers for desertion during [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/news/opinion/patriots-ignore-greatest-brutality/2007/08/12/1186857342382.html?page=2 Patriots ignore greatest brutality]. ''The Sydney Morning Herald.'' August 13, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In the past, [[cowardice]], absence without leave, [[desertion]], [[insubordination]], [[looting]], shirking under enemy fire and disobeying orders were often crimes punishable by death (see [[Decimation (Roman army)|decimation]] and [[running the gauntlet]]). One method of execution since firearms came into common use has almost invariably been [[firing squad]]. Moreover, various authoritarian states—for example those with fascist or communist governments—employed the death penalty as a potent means of political oppression. According to the declassified [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] archives, 681,692 people were shot in 1937 and 1938 alone – an average of 1,000 executions a day.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;''[http://books.google.com/books?id=JyN0hlKcfTcC&amp;pg=PA373&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false A Companion to Russian History]''&quot;. Abbott Gleason (2009). Wiley-Blackwell. p.373. ISBN 1405135603&lt;/ref&gt; Partly as a response to such excessive punishment, civil organisations have started to place increasing emphasis on the concept of [[human rights]] and abolition of the death penalty.

Among countries around the world, almost all European and many Pacific Area states (including Australia, New Zealand and [[Timor Leste]]), and Canada have abolished capital punishment. In [[Latin America]], most states have completely abolished the use of capital punishment, while some countries, such as [[Brazil]], allow for capital punishment only in exceptional situations, such as treason committed during wartime. The [[Capital punishment in the United States|United States]] (the federal government and 34 of the states), [[Guatemala]], most of the [[Caribbean]] and the majority of democracies in Asia (for example, Japan and India) and Africa (for example, [[Botswana]] and [[Zambia]]) retain it. South Africa, which is probably the most developed African nation, and which has been a democracy since 1994, does not have the death penalty. This fact is currently quite controversial in that country, due to the high levels of violent crime, including murder and rape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/politics/definite-no-to-death-row-asmal-1.392362 |title= Definite no to Death Row – Asmal|accessdate= 2008-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advocates of the death penalty argue that it deters crime, is a good tool for police and prosecutors (in [[plea bargain]]ing for example),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=James Pitkin |url=http://wweek.com/editorial/3411/10288/ |title=&quot;Killing Time&quot; &amp;#124; Willamette Week &amp;#124; January 23rd, 2008 |publisher=Wweek.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; improves the community by making sure that convicted criminals do not offend again, provides closure to surviving victims or loved ones, and is a just penalty for their crime. Opponents of capital punishment argue that it has led to the execution of [[Wrongful execution|wrongfully convicted]], that it discriminates against minorities and the poor, that it does not deter criminals more than [[life imprisonment]], that it encourages a &quot;culture of violence&quot;, that it is more expensive than life imprisonment,&lt;ref name=&quot;deathPenaltyFocus&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deathpenalty.org/article.php?id=42|title=The High Cost of the Death Penalty|publisher= [[Death Penalty Focus]]|accessdate=2008-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that it violates human rights.

===Movements towards humane execution===
{{See|Cruel and unusual punishment}}
[[File:SQ Lethal Injection Room.jpg|thumb|400px|A gurney in the [[San Quentin State Prison]] in the United States on which prisoners are restrained during an execution by [[lethal injection]].]]
In early [[New England]], public executions were a very solemn and sorrowful occasion, sometimes attended by large crowds, who also listened to a Gospel message&lt;ref&gt;[http://calebadams.org/news_article.htm Article from the ''Connecticut Courant''] (December 1, 1803)&lt;/ref&gt; and remarks by local preachers and politicians. The ''[[The Hartford Courant|Connecticut Courant]]'' records one such public execution on December 1, 1803, saying, &quot;The assembly conducted through the whole in a very orderly and solemn manner, so much so, as to occasion an observing gentleman acquainted with other countries as well as this, to say that such an assembly, so decent and solemn, could not be collected anywhere but in New England.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://calebadams.org/index.htm The Execution of Caleb Adams], 2003&lt;/ref&gt;
Trends in most of the world have long been to move to less painful, or more humane, executions. France developed the [[guillotine]] for this reason in the final years of the 18th century while Britain banned [[Hanged, drawn and quartered|drawing and quartering]] in the early 19th century. [[Hanging]] by turning the victim off a ladder or by kicking a stool or a bucket, which causes death by suffocation, was replaced by [[Long drop|long drop &quot;hanging&quot;]] where the subject is dropped a longer distance to dislocate the neck and sever the [[spinal cord]]. Shah of Persia introduced throat-cutting and [[blowing from a gun]] as quick and painless alternatives to more tormentous methods of executions used at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://explorion.net/ride-india-across-persia-and-baluchistan/chapter-vii-ispahan-shiraz?page=3&amp;quicktabs_3=1 |title=• Travel &amp; Exploration • A Ride to India across Persia and Baluchistan • CHAPTER VII. ISPAHAN - SHIRAZ |publisher=Explorion.net |date= |accessdate=2011-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S., the [[electric chair]] and the [[gas chamber]] were introduced as more humane alternatives to hanging, but have been almost entirely superseded by [[lethal injection]], which in turn has been criticised as being too painful. Nevertheless, some countries still employ slow hanging methods, beheading by sword and even [[stoning]], although the latter is rarely employed.

===Abolitionism===
The death penalty was banned in China between 747 and 759. In Japan, Emperor Saga abolished the death penalty in 818 under the influence of Shinto and it lasted until 1156. Therefore, capital punishment was not executed for 338 years in ancient Japan. In England, a public statement of opposition was included in [[The Twelve Conclusions of the Lollards]], written in 1395. Sir Thomas More's ''[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]]'', published in 1516, debated the benefits of the death penalty in dialogue form, coming to no firm conclusion. More recent opposition to the death penalty stemmed from the book of the Italian [[Cesare Beccaria]] ''Dei Delitti e Delle Pene'' (&quot;[[On Crimes and Punishments]]&quot;), published in 1764. In this book, Beccaria aimed to demonstrate not only the injustice, but even the futility from the point of view of [[social policy|social welfare]], of [[torture]] and the death penalty. Influenced by the book, [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Grand Duke Leopold II]] of Habsburg, famous [[The Age of Enlightenment|enlightened monarch]] and future Emperor of Austria, abolished the death penalty in the then-independent [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany]], the first permanent abolition in modern times. On November 30, 1786, after having ''de facto'' blocked capital executions (the last was in 1769), Leopold promulgated the reform of the [[penal code]] that abolished the death penalty and ordered the destruction of all the instruments for capital execution in his land. In 2000 Tuscany's regional authorities instituted an annual holiday on November 30 to commemorate the event. The event is commemorated on this day by 300 cities around the world celebrating [[Cities for Life Day]].

[[File:Leopold II as Grand Duke of Tuscany by Joseph Hickel 1769.jpg|thumb|upright|Peter Leopold II, Grand Duke of Tuscany, by Joseph Hickel, 1769]]

The [[Roman Republic (19th century)|Roman Republic]] banned capital punishment in 1849. [[Venezuela]] followed suit and abolished the death penalty in 1863 and [[Use of capital punishment by nation|San Marino]] did so in 1865. The last execution in San Marino had taken place in 1468. In Portugal, after [[legislative]] proposals in 1852 and 1863, the death penalty was abolished in 1867.

In the United Kingdom, it was abolished for murder (leaving only [[treason]], [[piracy with violence]], [[Arson in royal dockyards]] and a number of wartime military offences as capital crimes) for a five year experiment in 1965 and permanently in 1969, the last execution having taken place in 1964. It was abolished for all peacetime offences in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stephen-stratford.co.uk/capital_hist.htm |title=History of Capital Punishment |publisher=Stephen-stratford.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abolition occurred in [[Capital punishment in Canada#History|Canada in 1976]], in [[Capital punishment in France#Abolition|France in 1981]], and in [[Capital punishment in Australia#Commonwealth|Australia in 1973]] (although the state of [[Capital punishment in Australia#Western Australia|Western Australia]] retained the penalty until 1984). In 1977, the United Nations General Assembly affirmed in a formal resolution that throughout the world, it is desirable to &quot;progressively restrict the number of offenses for which the death penalty might be imposed, with a view to the desirability of abolishing this punishment&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsbatch.com/deathpenalty.htm |title=Death Penalty |publisher=Newsbatch.com |date=2005-03-01 |accessdate=2010-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, [[Michigan]] was the first state to ban the death penalty, on May 18, 1846.&lt;ref&gt;See Caitlin [http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=micounty;cc=micounty;rgn=full%20text;idno=APK1036.0001.001;didno=APK1036.0001.001;view=image;seq=00000444 pp. 420–422]&lt;/ref&gt; The death penalty was declared unconstitutional between 1972 and 1976 based on the [[Furman v. Georgia]] case, but the 1976 [[Gregg v. Georgia]] case once again permitted the death penalty under certain circumstances. Further limitations were placed on the death penalty in [[Atkins v. Virginia]] (death penalty unconstitutional for persons suffering from mental retardation) and [[Roper v. Simmons]] (death penalty unconstitutional if defendant was under age 18 at the time the crime was committed). Currently, as of March 9, 2011, 16 states of the U.S. and the [[District of Columbia]] ban capital punishment, with Illinois the most recent state to ban the practice.&lt;ref name=&quot;QuinnSignsAbolition&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://newsblogs.chicagotribune.com/clout_st/2011/03/quinn-signs-death-penalty-ban-commutes-15-death-row-sentences-to-life.html|title=Quinn signs death penalty ban, commutes 15 death row sentences to life|date=March 9, 2011|accessdate=March 9, 2011|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the states where the death penalty is permitted, [[California]] has the largest number of inmates on [[death row]], while [[Texas]] has been the most active in carrying out executions (approximately one third of all executions since the practice was reinstated).

The latest country to abolish the death penalty for all crimes was [[Gabon]], in February 2010.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.handsoffcain.info/archivio_news/index.php?iddocumento=15302086&amp;mover=0&lt;/ref&gt; Human rights activists oppose the death penalty, calling it &quot;cruel, inhuman, and degrading punishment&quot;. Amnesty International considers it to be &quot;the ultimate denial of Human Rights&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amnesty.org/en/death-penalty |title=Abolish the death penalty &amp;#124; Amnesty International |publisher=Amnesty.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary use==
===Global distribution===
Since [[World War II]] there has been a trend toward abolishing the death penalty. In 1977, 16 countries were abolitionist. According to information published by Amnesty International in 2011, 96 countries had abolished capital punishment altogether, 9 had done so for all offences except under special circumstances, and 34 had not used it for at least 10 years or were under a moratorium. The other 58 retained the death penalty in active use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amnesty.org/en/death-penalty/abolitionist-and-retentionist-countries|title=Abolitionist and Retentionist Countries|publisher=Amnesty International|accessdate=2008-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Criminal procedure (trial)}}
According to Amnesty International, at least 23 countries were known to have had executions carried out in 2010. In addition, there are countries which do not publish information on the use of capital punishment, most significantly China, which is estimated to execute hundreds of people each year. At least 17,000 people worldwide were under sentence of death at the beginning of 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Amnesty International | first =  | title = The Death Penalty in 2009  | url=http://www.amnesty.org/en/death-penalty/death-sentences-and-executions-in-2009 | accessdate = 29 May 2010 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of the death penalty is becoming increasingly restrained in [[retentionist]] countries.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} Singapore, Japan, Taiwan, South Korea and the U.S. are the only [[developed country|developed countries]] that have retained the death penalty. The death penalty was overwhelmingly practiced in poor and authoritarian states, which often employed the death penalty as a tool of political oppression. During the 1980s, the democratisation of Latin America swelled the rank of abolitionist countries. This was soon followed by the fall of [[communism]] in [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Eastern Europe]], which then aspired to enter the [[EU]]. In these countries, the public support for the death penalty varies but is generally supported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/article.php?did=2165|title=International Polls &amp; Studies|publisher=The [[Death Penalty Information Center]]|accessdate=2008-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European Union]] and the [[Council of Europe]] both strictly require [[List of European Union member states|member states]] not to practice the death penalty (see [[Capital punishment in Europe]]). On the other hand, rapid industrialisation in Asia has been increasing the number of developed retentionist countries. In these countries, the death penalty enjoys strong public support, and the matter receives little attention from the government or the media. This trend has been followed by some African and Middle Eastern countries where support for the death penalty is high.

Some countries have resumed practicing the death penalty after having suspended executions for long periods. The United States suspended executions in 1967 but resumed them in 1977, then [[Lethal injection#Constitutionality in the United States|again]] on 25 September 2007 to 16 April 2008; there was no execution in India between 1995 and 2004; and [[Sri Lanka]] declared an end to its [[Moratorium (law)|moratorium]] on the death penalty on 20 Nov. 2004,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amnesty.org.uk/news_details_p.asp?NewsID=16269 |title=AIUK : Sri Lanka: President urged to prevent return to death penalty after 29-year moratorium |publisher=Amnesty.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; although it has not yet performed any executions. The [[Philippines]] re-introduced the death penalty in 1993 after abolishing it in 1987, but abolished it again in 2006.

===Execution for drug-related offences===
{{main|Capital punishment for drug trafficking}}
Some countries that retain the death penalty for murder and other violent crimes do not execute offenders for drug-related crimes. The following is a list of countries that currently have statutory provisions for the death penalty for drug-related offences.

===Juvenile offenders===
The death penalty for [[Adolescence|juvenile]] offenders (criminals aged under 18 years at the time of their crime) has become increasingly rare. Since 1990, nine countries have executed offenders who were juveniles at the time of their crimes: The [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC), [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[Iran]], [[Nigeria]], [[Pakistan]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Sudan]], the [[United States]] and [[Yemen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internationaljusticeproject.org/juvWorld.cfm |title=Juvenile executions (except US) |publisher=Internationaljusticeproject.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PRC&lt;!--Refer to it as PRC to avoid confusion with the ROC on Taiwan--&gt;, Pakistan, the United States and Yemen have since raised the minimum age to 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.amnesty.org/pages/deathpenalty-facts-eng|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080709010807/http://web.amnesty.org/pages/deathpenalty-facts-eng|archivedate=2008-07-09 |title=Amnesty International |publisher=Web.amnesty.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amnesty International has recorded 61 verified executions since then, in several countries, of both juveniles and adults who had been convicted of committing their offenses as juveniles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=› List of executions since 1990 |url=http://www.amnesty.org/en/death-penalty/executions-of-child-offenders-since-1990 |title=Amnesty International |publisher=Amnesty.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PRC does not allow for the execution of those under 18, but child executions have reportedly taken place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGACT500152004|title=Stop Child Executions!

Oklahoma]]'' (1988), and for all juveniles in ''[[Roper v. Simmons]]'' (2005). In addition, in 2002, the United States Supreme Court declared unconstitutional the execution of individuals with [[mental retardation]], in ''[[Atkins v. Virginia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.cnn.com/2002/LAW/06/20/scotus.executions/ Supreme Court bars executing mentally retarded] CNN.com Law Center. June 25, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 2005 and May 2008, Iran, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Sudan and Yemen were reported to have executed child offenders, the most being from Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrw.org/pub/2008/children/HRW.Juv.Death.Penalty.053008.pdf |title=HRW Report |publisher=Hrw.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Nations]] [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]], which forbids capital punishment for juveniles under article 37(a), has been signed by all countries and [[ratification|ratified]], except for [[Somalia]] and the United States (notwithstanding the latter's Supreme Court decisions abolishing the practice).&lt;ref&gt;UNICEF, [http://www.unicef.org/crc/index_30229.html Convention of the Rights of the Child – FAQ]: &quot;The Convention on the Rights of the Child is the most widely and rapidly ratified human rights treaty in history. Only two countries, Somalia and the United States, have not ratified this celebrated agreement. Somalia is currently unable to proceed to ratification as it has no recognised government. By signing the Convention, the United States has signaled its intention to ratify, but has yet to do so.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The UN Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights maintains that the death penalty for juveniles has become contrary to a [[jus cogens]] of [[customary international law]]. A majority of countries are also party to the U.N. [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (whose Article 6.5 also states that &quot;Sentence of death shall not be imposed for crimes committed by persons below eighteen years of age...&quot;).

In Japan, the minimum age for the death penalty is 18 as mandated by the internationals standards. But under Japanese law, anyone under 20 is considered a juvenile. There are [[Capital punishment in Japan#Death sentences for minors|three men currently on death row]] for crimes they committed at age 18 or 19.

====Iran====
Iran, despite its ratification of the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] and [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]], is currently the world's biggest executioner of juvenile offenders, for which it has received international condemnation; the country's record is the focus of the [[Stop Child Executions Campaign]].

Iran accounts for two-thirds of the global total of such executions, and currently has roughly 140 people on death row for crimes committed as juveniles (up from 71 in 2007).&lt;ref name=AP&gt;[http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hEpCQELUurPSUIMGb53VspZr39FQD938IT7G5 Iranian activists fight child executions]{{Dead link|date=April 2009}}, Ali Akbar Dareini, [[Associated Press]], September 17, 2008.

====Somalia====
There is evidence that child executions are taking place in the parts of Somalia controlled by the [[Islamic Courts Union]] (ICU). In October 2008, a girl, Aisho Ibrahim Dhuhulow was buried up to her neck at a [[football stadium]], then [[stoning|stoned]] to death in front of more than 1,000 people. The stoning occurred after she had allegedly pleaded guilty to [[adultery]] in a [[shariah]] court in [[Kismayo]], a city controlled by the ICU. According to a local leader associated with the ICU, she had stated that she wanted shariah law to apply.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7694397.stm|title= Somali woman executed by stoning |date=2008-10-27|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2008-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, other sources state that the victim had been crying, that she begged for mercy and had to be forced into the hole before being buried up to her neck in the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/7708169.stm | work=BBC News | title=Stoning victim 'begged for mercy' | date=November 4, 2008 | accessdate=April 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amnesty International later learned that the girl was in fact 13 years old and had been arrested by the al-Shabab militia after she had reported being gang-raped by three men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amnesty.org/en/for-media/press-releases/somalia-girl-stoned-was-child-13-20081031|title=Somalia: Girl stoned was a child of 13|date=2008-10-31|publisher=Amnesty International|accessdate=2008-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Somalia's recently established [[Transitional Federal Government]] announced in November 2009 that it plans to ratify the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]]. This move was lauded by [[UNICEF]] as a welcome attempt to secure children's rights in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-11/20/content_12510818.htm |title=UNICEF lauds move by Somalia to ratify child convention |publisher=News.xinhuanet.com |date=2009-11-20 |accessdate=2010-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy and debate==
{{Main|Capital punishment debate}}

Capital punishment is often the subject of controversy. Opponents of the death penalty argue that it has led to the [[Wrongful execution|execution of innocent people]], that its main motive is not [[justice]] but [[revenge]] and to save money, that life imprisonment is an effective and less expensive substitute,&lt;ref name=&quot;deathPenaltyFocus&quot; /&gt; that it discriminates against minorities and the poor, and that it violates the criminal's [[right to life]]. Supporters believe that the penalty is justified for murderers by the principle of [[Retributive justice|retribution]], that life imprisonment is not an equally effective deterrent, and that the death penalty affirms the right to life by punishing those who violate it in the strictest form. {{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

===Wrongful executions===
{{Main|Wrongful execution}}

Wrongful execution is a [[miscarriage of justice]] occurring when an innocent person is put to death by capital punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/article.php?did=412&amp;scid=6 |title=Innocence and the Death Penalty |publisher=Deathpenaltyinfo.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many people have been proclaimed innocent victims of the death penalty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://capitaldefenseweekly.com/innocent.html Capital Defense Weekly&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{Dead link|date=August 2010}} {{Wayback |url=http://capitaldefenseweekly.com/innocent.html |date=20070804222621 |bot=H3llBot}}{{Dead link|date=August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justicedenied.org/executed.htm |title=Executed Innocents |publisher=Justicedenied.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mitglied.lycos.de/PeterWill/penal9.htm |title=Wrongful executions |publisher=Mitglied.lycos.de |date= |accessdate=2010-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some have claimed that as many as 39 executions have been carried out in the U.S. in face of compelling evidence of innocence or serious doubt about guilt. Newly available [[DNA evidence]] has allowed the [[exoneration]] of more than 15 [[death row]] inmates since 1992 in the U.S.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.innocenceproject.org/Content/575.php |title=The Innocence Project – News and Information: Press Releases |publisher=Innocenceproject.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; but DNA evidence is only available in a fraction of capital cases. In the UK, reviews prompted by the [[Criminal Cases Review Commission]] have resulted in one pardon and three exonerations {{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} with compensation paid for people executed between 1950 and 1953, when the execution rate in [[England and Wales]] averaged 17 per year.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

===Public opinion===
{{Ref improve section|date=January 2010}}
In [[Canada]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Latin America]], and [[Western Europe]], the death penalty has become relatively unpopular, with the majority of the population opposing it.&lt;ref&gt;''Death penalty information center'' &quot;International Polls and Studies&quot;. Retrieved 2010-05-30.[http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/international-polls-and-studies]&lt;/ref&gt; However certain cases of mass murder, terrorism, and child murder occasionally cause waves of support for reinstitution, such as the [[Murder of Tim McLean|Greyhound bus beheading]], [[Port Arthur massacre (Australia)|Port Arthur massacre]] and [[Bali bombings]]. Between 2000 and 2010, support for the return of capital punishment in Canada dropped from 44% to 40%, and opposition to it returning rose from 43% to 46%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/politics/story/2010/03/18/ekos-poll018.html | work=CBC News | title=Canadians split on pot, death penalty: poll | date=March 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abolition was often adopted due to political change, as when countries shifted from authoritarianism to democracy, or when it became an entry condition for the European Union. The United States is a notable exception: some states have had bans on capital punishment for decades (the earliest is [[Michigan]], where it was abolished in 1847), while others actively use it today. The death penalty there remains a contentious issue which is hotly debated. Elsewhere, however, it is rare for the death penalty to be abolished as a result of an active public discussion of its merits.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

In abolitionist countries, debate is sometimes revived by particularly brutal murders, though few countries have brought it back after abolishing it. However, a spike in serious, violent crimes, such as murders or terrorist attacks, has prompted some countries (such as [[Sri Lanka]] and [[Jamaica]]) to effectively end the moratorium on the death penalty. In retentionist countries, the debate is sometimes revived when a miscarriage of justice has occurred, though this tends to cause legislative efforts to improve the judicial process rather than to abolish the death penalty.

A [[Gallup poll|Gallup]] International poll from 2000 said that &quot;Worldwide support was expressed in favor of the death penalty, with just more than half (52%) indicating that they were in favour of this form of punishment.&quot;
A number of [http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/article.php?did=2165 other polls and studies] have been done in recent years with various results.

In a poll completed by Gallup in October 2009, 65% of Americans supported the death penalty for persons convicted of murder, while 31% were against and 5% did not have an opinion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gallup.com/poll/1606/death-penalty.aspx 2008 Gallup Death Penalty Poll].&lt;/ref&gt;

In the U.S., surveys have long shown a majority in favor of capital punishment. An [[ABC News]] survey in July 2006 found 65 percent in favour of capital punishment, consistent with other polling since 2000.&lt;ref&gt;ABC News poll, [http://abcnews.go.com/images/Politics/1015a3DeathPenalty.pdf &quot;Capital Punishment, 30 Years On: Support, but Ambivalence as Well&quot;] (PDF, July 1, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; About half the American public says the death penalty is not imposed frequently enough and 60 percent believe it is applied fairly, according to a [[Gallup poll]] from May 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pollingreport.com/crime.htm Crime&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;].&lt;/ref&gt; Yet surveys also show the public is more divided when asked to choose between the death penalty and [[Life imprisonment|life without parole]], or when dealing with juvenile offenders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publicagenda.org/issues/major_proposals_detail.cfm?issue_type=crime&amp;list=3]{{Dead link|date=April 2009}} [http://www.publicagenda.org/issues/major_proposals_detail.cfm?issue_type=crime&amp;list=10]{{Dead link|date=April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roughly six in 10 tell Gallup they do not believe capital punishment deters murder and majorities believe at least one innocent person has been executed in the past five years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publicagenda.org/issues/major_proposals_detail.cfm?issue_type=crime&amp;list=5]{{Dead link|date=April 2009}} [http://www.publicagenda.org/issues/major_proposals_detail.cfm?issue_type=crime&amp;list=8]{{Dead link|date=April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diminished capacity===
In the United States, there has been an evolving debate as to whether capital punishment should apply to persons with diminished mental capacity. In ''[[Ford v. Wainwright]]'',&lt;ref&gt;477 U.S. 399 (1986).&lt;/ref&gt; the Supreme Court held that the Eighth Amendment prohibits the state from carrying out the death penalty on an individual who is insane, and that properly raised issues of execution-time sanity must be determined in a proceeding satisfying the minimum requirements of due process. In ''[[Atkins v. Virginia]]'',&lt;ref&gt;536 U.S. 304, 122 S. Ct. 2242 (2002).&lt;/ref&gt; the Supreme Court addressed whether the Eighth Amendment prohibits the execution of mentally retarded persons. The Court noted that a &quot;national consensus&quot; had developed against it.&lt;ref&gt;122 S. Ct. at 2249.&lt;/ref&gt; While such executions are still permitted for people with marginal retardation, evidence of retardation is allowed as a mitigating circumstance. However, a recent case of [[Teresa Lewis]] who was the first woman executed in Virginia since 1912, proved to be very controversial because Governor [[Bob McDonnell]] refused to commute her sentence to life imprisonment, even though she had an IQ of 70.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Steinmetz |first=Katy |url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,2017362,00.html |title=Virginia Woman Faces Execution amid Calls for Leniency |publisher=TIME |date=2010-09-10 |accessdate=2010-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/World-News/Grandmother-Teresa-Lewis-To-Be-Executed-In-Virginia-After-Last-Minute-Reprieve-Refused/Article/201009415741205?lpos=World_News_Top_Stories_Header_2&amp;lid=ARTICLE_15741205_Grandmother_Teresa_Lewis_To_Be_Executed_In_Virginia_After_Last_Minute_Reprieve_Refused |title=Grandmother Teresa Lewis to be executed in Virginia after last minute reprieve refused |publisher=News.sky.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International &lt;!-- British spelling like the rest of the article, don't change--&gt;organisations&lt;!-- British spelling like the rest of the article, don't change--&gt;===
The [[United Nations]] introduced a [[UN moratorium on the death penalty|resolution]] during the General Assembly's 62nd sessions in 2007 calling for a universal ban.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcoalition.org/modules/news/article.php?storyid=10|title=Journée contre la peine de mort : le monde décide!|author=Thomas Hubert|date=2007-06-29|language=French|publisher=Coalition Mondiale}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.amnesty.org/pages/deathpenalty-index-eng Amnesty International&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;].&lt;/ref&gt; The approval of a draft resolution by the Assembly's third committee, which deals with human rights issues, voted 99 to 52, with 33 abstentions, in favour of the resolution on November 15, 2007 and was put to a vote in the Assembly on December 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/news/un-set-key-death-penalty-vote-20071209|title=UN set for key death penalty vote|publisher=Amnesty International|date=2007-12-09|accessdate=2008-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://wcd.coe.int/ViewDoc.jsp?id=1212297 Directorate of Communication – The global campaign against the death penalty is gaining momentum – Statement by Terry Davis, Secretary General of the Council of Europe&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.un.org/ga/news/news.asp?NewsID=24679&amp;Cr=general&amp;Cr1=assembly UN General Assembly – Latest from the UN News Centre&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;].&lt;/ref&gt; Again in 2008, a large majority of states from all regions adopted a second resolution calling for a moratorium on the use of the death penalty in the UN General Assembly (Third Committee) on November 20. 105 countries voted in favour of the draft resolution, 48 voted against and 31 abstained. A range of amendments proposed by a small minority of pro-death penalty countries were overwhelmingly defeated. It had in 2007 passed a non-binding resolution (by 104 to 54, with 29 abstentions) by asking its member states for &quot;a moratorium on executions with a view to abolishing the death penalty&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUSN1849885920071218|title=U.N. Assembly calls for moratorium on death penalty|publisher=Reuters | date=December 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:04CFREU-Article2-Crop.jpg|thumb|left|350px|Article 2 of the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union]] affirms the prohibition on capital punishment in the [[European Union|EU]]]]
A number of regional conventions prohibit the death penalty, most notably, the Sixth Protocol (abolition in time of peace) and the 13th Protocol (abolition in all circumstances) to the [[European Convention on Human Rights]]. The same is also stated under the Second Protocol in the [[American Convention on Human Rights]], which, however has not been ratified by all countries in the Americas, most notably Canada and the United States. Most relevant operative international treaties do not require its prohibition for cases of serious crime, most notably, the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]]. This instead has, in common with several other treaties, an optional protocol prohibiting capital punishment and promoting its wider abolition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr-death.htm|title= Second Optional Protocol to the ICCPR|accessdate= 2007-12-08|publisher=Office of the UN High Commissioner on Human Rights}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several international organizations have made the abolition of the death penalty (during time of peace) a requirement of membership, most notably the [[European Union]] (EU) and the [[Council of Europe]]. The EU and the Council of Europe are willing to accept a [[Moratorium (law)|moratorium]] as an interim measure. Thus, while Russia is a member of the Council of Europe, and practices the death penalty in law, it has not made public use of it since becoming a member of the Council. Other states, while having abolished [[de jure]] the death penalty in time of peace and [[de facto]] in all circumstances, have not ratified [http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/Commun/ChercheSig.asp?NT=187&amp;CM=8&amp;DF=11/20/2007&amp;CL=ENG Protocol no.13] yet and therefore have no international obligation to refrain from using the death penalty in time of war or imminent threat of war (Armenia, Latvia, Poland and Spain).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amnesty.org/en/death-penalty/ratification-of-international-treaties Amnesty International&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;].&lt;/ref&gt; Italy is the most recent to ratify it, on March 3, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcoalition.org/modules/smartsection/item.php?itemid=328 Italy abolishes the death penalty in all circumstances].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Turkey]] has recently, as a move towards EU membership, undergone a reform of its legal system. Previously there was a ''de facto'' moratorium on the death penalty in Turkey as the last execution took place in 1984. The death penalty was removed from peacetime law in August 2002, and in May 2004 Turkey amended its constitution in order to remove capital punishment in all circumstances. It ratified Protocol no. 13 to the European Convention on Human Rights in February 2006. As a result, Europe is a continent free of the death penalty in practice, all states but Russia, which has entered a moratorium, having ratified the Sixth Protocol to the European Convention on Human Rights, with the sole exception of [[Belarus]], which is not a member of the Council of Europe. The [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe]] has been lobbying for Council of Europe observer states who practice the death penalty, the U.S. and Japan, to abolish it or lose their observer status. In addition to banning capital punishment for EU member states, the EU has also banned detainee transfers in cases where the receiving party may seek the death penalty.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}

Among non-governmental organizations (NGOs), Amnesty International and [[Human Rights Watch]] are noted for their opposition to capital punishment. A number of such NGOs, as well as trade unions, local councils and bar associations formed a [[World Coalition Against the Death Penalty]] in 2002.

==Religious views==
{{Main|Religion and capital punishment}}

{{Ref improve section|date=May 2010}}

===Buddhism===
There is disagreement among Buddhists as to whether or not Buddhism forbids the death penalty. The first of the [[Five Precepts]] (Panca-sila) is to abstain from destruction of life. Chapter 10 of the [[Dhammapada]] states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Everyone fears punishment; everyone fears death, just as you do. Therefore you do not kill or cause to be killed.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Chapter 26, the final chapter of the Dhammapada, states, &quot;Him I call a [[brahmin]] who has put aside weapons and renounced violence toward all creatures. He neither kills nor helps others to kill.&quot; These sentences are interpreted by many Buddhists (especially in the West) as an injunction against supporting any legal measure which might lead to the death penalty. However, as is often the case with the interpretation of scripture, there is dispute on this matter. Historically, most states where the official religion is [[Buddhism]] have imposed capital punishment for some offenses. One notable exception is the abolition of the death penalty by the [[Emperor Saga]] of Japan in 818. This lasted until 1165, although in private manors executions continued to be conducted as a form of retaliation. [[Japan]] still imposes the death penalty, although some recent justice ministers have refused to sign death warrants, citing their [[Buddhist]] beliefs as their reason.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7694483.stm |title=Japan hangs two more on death row (see also paragraph 11) |publisher=BBC News |date=2008-10-28 |accessdate=2010-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Buddhist-majority states vary in their policy. For example, [[Bhutan]] has abolished the death penalty, but [[Thailand]] still retains it, although [[Buddhism]] is the official religion in both.

===Judaism===
The official teachings of [[Judaism]] approve the death penalty in principle but the standard of proof required for application of death penalty is extremely stringent. In practice, it has been abolished by various Talmudic decisions, making the situations in which a death sentence could be passed effectively impossible and hypothetical. A capital case could not be tried by a normal ''[[Beit Din]]'' of three judges, it can only be adjudicated by a ''[[Sanhedrin]]'' of a minimum of 23 judges.&lt;ref&gt;[[Babylonian Talmud]] [[Sanhedrin (Talmud)|Sanhedrin]] 2a&lt;/ref&gt; Forty years before the destruction of the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] in 70 &lt;small&gt;CE&lt;/small&gt;, i.e. in 30 &lt;small&gt;CE&lt;/small&gt;, the [[Sanhedrin]] effectively abolished capital punishment, making it a hypothetical upper limit on the severity of punishment, fitting in finality for God alone to use, not fallible people.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jerusalem Talmud]] (Sanhedrin 41 a)&lt;/ref&gt;

The 12th century Jewish legal scholar, [[Maimonides]] said:

: &quot;It is better and more satisfactory to acquit a thousand guilty persons than to put a single innocent one to death.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Goldstein(Rabbi.)2006&quot;&gt;{{cite book

Maimonides argued that executing a defendant on anything less than absolute certainty would lead to a slippery slope of decreasing burdens of proof, until we would be convicting merely &quot;according to the judge's caprice&quot;. Maimonides was concerned about the need for the law to guard itself in public perceptions, to preserve its majesty and retain the people's respect.&lt;ref&gt;Moses Maimonides, ''The Commandments, Neg. Comm. 290'', at 269–271 (Charles B. Chavel trans., 1967).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islam===
Scholars of [[Islam]]{{Who|date=May 2010}} hold it to be permissible but the victim or the family of the victim has the right to pardon. In [[Islamic jurisprudence]] (''Fiqh''), to forbid what is not forbidden is forbidden. Consequently, it is impossible to make a case for abolition of the death penalty, which is explicitly endorsed.

[[Sharia Law]] or Islamic law may require capital punishment, there is great variation within Islamic nations as to actual capital punishment. [[Apostasy in Islam]] and [[Rajm|stoning to death in Islam]] are controversial topics.
Furthermore, as expressed in the Qur'an, capital punishment is condoned. Although the Qur'an prescribes the death penalty for several ''hadd'' (fixed) crimes—including rape—murder is not among them. Instead, murder is treated as a civil crime and is covered by the law of ''qisas'' (retaliation), whereby the relatives of the victim decide whether the offender is punished with death by the authorities or made to pay ''diyah'' ([[wergild]]) as compensation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Encyclopædia Britannica |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9020149/capital-punishment |title=capital punishment – Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;If anyone kills person—unless it be for murder or for spreading mischief in the land—it would be as if he killed all people. And if anyone saves a life, it would be as if he saved the life of all people&quot; (Qur'an 5:32). &quot;Spreading mischief in the land&quot; can mean many different things, but is generally interpreted to mean those crimes that affect the community as a whole, and destabilise the society.

Crimes that have fallen under this description have included: treason, apostasy, piracy (essentially armed robbery), murder, terrorism, rape including paedophilia, adultery, homosexual intercourse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://islam.about.com/cs/law/a/c_punishment.htm |title=Capital Punishment in Islam |publisher=Islam.about.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there is also a minority view within some Muslims that capital punishment is not justified in the light of Qur'an.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kashifshahzada.com/2010/11/20/why-the-death-penalty-is-un-islamic |title=Why The Death Penalty is un-Islamic? - Kashif Shahzada 2010 |date= |accessdate=2010-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christianity===
Although some{{Who|date=May 2010}} interpret [[Jesus]]'s teachings as condemning violence in [[Gospel of Luke|The Gospel of Luke]] and [[Gospel of Matthew|The Gospel of Matthew]] where he advocates [[Turning the other cheek]], and [[Pericope Adulterae]] in which Jesus intervenes in the [[stoning]] of an adulteress (most scholars&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = NETBible: John 7 | publisher = Bible.org | url = http://net.bible.org/bible.php?book=Joh&amp;chapter=7#n139 | accessdate = 2009-10-17}}  See note 139 on that page.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Keith | first = Chris | title = Recent and Previous Research on the ''Pericope Adulterae'' (John 7.53—8.11) | journal = Currents in Biblical Research | volume = 6 | issue = 3 | pages = 377–404 | year = 2008 | doi = 10.1177/1476993X07084793}}&lt;/ref&gt; agreeing that this passage was &quot;certainly not part of the original text of St John's Gospel&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Oxford&quot;&gt;'Pericope adulterae', in FL Cross (ed.), ''The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church'', (New York: [[Oxford University Press]], 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;), others consider [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans 13:3–4]] to support the death penalty. Many Christians have believed that Jesus's doctrine of peace speaks only to personal ethics and is distinct from civil government's duty to punish crime. Also, Leviticus [[Leviticus|20|2–27]] has a whole list of situations in which execution is supported. Christian positions on this vary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/exe_bibl2.htm |title=What The Christian Scriptures Say About The Death Penalty – Capital Punishment |publisher=Religioustolerance.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sixth [[Ten Commandments|commandment]] (fifth in the [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] and [[Lutheran]] churches) is preached as 'Thou shalt not kill' by some denominations and as 'Thou shalt not murder' by others. As some denominations do not have a hard-line stance on the subject, Christians of such denominations are free to make a personal decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/christianity/christianethics/capitalpunishment_1.shtml |title=BBC – Religion &amp; Ethics – Capital punishment: Introduction |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2009-08-03 |accessdate=2011-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Roman Catholic Church====
[[Thomas Aquinas|St. Thomas Aquinas]], a [[Doctor of the Church#Catholicism|Doctor]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church|Church]], accepts the death penalty as a deterrent and prevention method but not as a means of vengeance. (See [[Thought of Thomas Aquinas#Death penalty|Aquinas on the death penalty]].) The [[Roman Catechism]] states this teaching thus:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Another kind of lawful slaying belongs to the civil authorities, to whom is entrusted power of life and death, by the legal and judicious exercise of which they punish the guilty and protect the innocent. The just use of this power, far from involving the crime of murder, is an act of paramount obedience to this Commandment which prohibits murder. The end of the Commandment is the preservation and security of human life. Now the punishments inflicted by the civil authority, which is the legitimate avenger of crime, naturally tend to this end, since they give security to life by repressing outrage and violence. Hence these words of David: ''In the morning I put to death all the wicked of the land, that I might cut off all the workers of iniquity from the city of the Lord''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cin.org/users/james/ebooks/master/trent/tcomm05.htm |title=THE CATECHISM OF TRENT: The Fifth Commandment |publisher=Cin.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In [[Evangelium Vitae]], [[Pope John Paul II]] suggested that capital punishment should be avoided unless it is the only way to defend society from the offender in question, opining that punishment &quot;ought not go to the extreme of executing the offender except in cases of absolute necessity: in other words, when it would not be possible otherwise to defend society. Today however, as a result of steady improvements in the organization of the penal system, such cases are very rare, if not practically non-existent.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/edocs/ENG0141/__PP.HTM Papal encyclical, Evangelium Vitae], March 25, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; The most recent edition of the [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] restates this view.&lt;ref&gt;Assuming that the guilty party's identity and responsibility have been fully determined, the traditional teaching of the Church does not exclude recourse to the death penalty, if this is the only possible way of effectively defending human lives against the unjust aggressor.&lt;/ref&gt; That the assessment of the contemporary situation advanced by John Paul II is not binding on the faithful was confirmed by [[Cardinal Ratzinger]] when he wrote in 2004 that,

&lt;blockquote&gt;if a Catholic were to be at odds with the Holy Father on the application of capital punishment or on the decision to wage war, he would not for that reason be considered unworthy to present himself to receive Holy Communion. While the Church exhorts civil authorities to seek peace, not war, and to exercise discretion and mercy in imposing punishment on criminals, it may still be permissible to take up arms to repel an aggressor or to have recourse to capital punishment. There may be a legitimate diversity of opinion even among Catholics about waging war and applying the death penalty, but not however with regard to abortion and euthanasia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.priestsforlife.org/magisterium/bishops/04-07ratzingerommunion.htm |title=Abortion - Pro Life - Cardinal Ratzinger on Voting, Abortion, and Worthiness to Receive Holy Communion |publisher=Priestsforlife.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While all Catholics must therefore hold that &quot;the infliction of capital punishment is not contrary to the teaching of the Catholic Church, and the power of the State to visit upon culprits the penalty of death derives much authority from revelation and from the writings of theologians&quot;, the matter of &quot;the advisability of exercising that power is, of course, an affair to be determined upon other and various considerations.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12565a.htm |title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Capital Punishment (Death Penalty) |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1911-06-01 |accessdate=2010-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Southern Baptist====
Southern Baptists support the fair and equitable use of capital punishment for those guilty of murder or treasonous acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sbc.net/resolutions/amResolution.asp?ID=299 |title=SBC Resolution: On Capital Punishment|accessdate=2010-10-26|publisher=Southern Baptist Convention}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Anglican and Episcopalian====
The [[Lambeth Conference]] of [[Anglican]] bishops condemned the death penalty in 1988:

{{Quote|This Conference: ... 3. Urges the Church to speak out against: ... (b) all governments who practice capital punishment, and encourages them to find alternative ways of sentencing offenders so that the divine dignity of every human being is respected and yet justice is pursued;....&lt;ref&gt;Lambeth Conference of Anglican Bishops, 1988, Resolution 33, paragraph 3. (b), found at [http://www.lambethconference.org/resolutions/1988/1988-33.cfm Lambeth Conference official website page]. Retrieved July 16, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====United Methodist Church====
The [[United Methodist Church]], along with other [[Methodist]] churches, also condemns capital punishment, saying that it cannot accept retribution or social vengeance as a reason for taking human life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.umc.org/interior_print.asp?ptid=4&amp;mid=1070 |title=The United Methodist Church: Capital Punishment |publisher=Archives.umc.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Church also holds that the death penalty falls unfairly and unequally upon marginalised persons including the poor, the uneducated, ethnic and religious minorities, and persons with mental and emotional illnesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.umc.org/interior.asp?ptid=1&amp;mid=2211 |title=The United Methodist Church: Official church statements on capital punishment |publisher=Archives.umc.org |date=2006-11-06 |accessdate=2011-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[General conference (United Methodist Church)|General Conference]] of the United Methodist Church calls for its [[bishop]]s to uphold opposition to capital punishment and for governments to enact an immediate moratorium on carrying out the death penalty sentence.

====The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America====
In a 1991 social policy statement, the ELCA officially took a stand to oppose the death penalty. It states that revenge is a primary motivation for capital punishment policy and that true healing can only take place through repentance and forgiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elca.org/socialstatements/deathpenalty/ |title=ELCA Social Statement on the Death Penalty |publisher=Elca.org |date=1991-09-04 |accessdate=2010-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other Protestants====
Several key leaders early in the [[Protestant Reformation]], including [[Martin Luther]] and [[John Calvin]], followed the traditional reasoning in favour of capital punishment, and the [[Lutheran Church]]'s [[Augsburg Confession]] explicitly defended it. Some Protestant groups have cited [[s:Bible (World English)/Genesis#Chapter 9|Genesis 9:5–6]], [[s:Bible (World English)/Romans#Chapter 13|Romans 13:3–4]], and
[[s:Bible (World English)/Leviticus#Chapter 20|Leviticus 20:1–27]] as the basis for permitting the death penalty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20060915114705/http://www.equip.org/free/CP1303.htm] http://web.archive.org/web/20061214111249/http://www.equip.org/free/CP1304.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mennonites]], [[Church of the Brethren]] and [[Religious Society of Friends|Friends]] have opposed the death penalty since their founding, and continue to be strongly opposed to it today. These groups, along with other Christians opposed to capital punishment, have cited [[Christ]]'s [[Sermon on the Mount]] (transcribed in [[s:Bible (World English)/Matthew#Chapter 5|Matthew Chapter 5–7]]) and [[Sermon on the Plain]] (transcribed in [[s:Bible (World English)/Luke#Chapter 6|Luke 6:17–49]]). In both sermons, Christ tells his followers to [[turn the other cheek]] and to love their enemies, which these groups believe mandates [[nonviolence]], including opposition to the death penalty.

====The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints====
[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (also called [[Mormons]]) neither promotes nor opposes capital punishment, although the church's founder, [[Joseph Smith, Jr.]], supported it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Roberts|1902|p=435}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, today the church officially state it is a &quot;matter to be decided solely by the prescribed processes of civil law.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsroom.lds.org/ldsnewsroom/eng/public-issues/capital-punishment |title=The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints: Public Issues |publisher=Newsroom.lds.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Community of Christ====
[[Community of Christ]], the former Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (RLDS), is opposed to capital punishment. The first stand against capital punishment was taken by the church's [[Presiding High Council]] in 1995. This was followed by a resolution of the [[World Conference (Community of Christ)|World Conference]] in 2000. This resolution, WC 1273, states: {{Quote|[W]e stand in opposition to the use of the death penalty; and ... as a peace church we seek ways to achieve healing and restorative justice. Church members are encouraged to work for the abolition of the death penalty in those states and nations that still practice this form of punishment.&lt;ref&gt;RLDS World Conference, Resolution 1273,
Adopted April 8, 2000, entitled &quot;Healing Ministry and Capital Punishment&quot; found online at [http://www.cofchrist.org/peace/statements/cptlpunish.asp].  Retrieved March 2, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Eastern Orthodox Christianity====
[[Eastern Orthodox]] Christianity does not officially condemn nor endorse capital punishment. It states that it is not a totally objectionable thing, but also that its abolishment can be driven by genuine Christian values, especially stressing the need for mercy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mospat.ru/en/documents/social-concepts/ix/ |title=The Basis of the Social Concept, IX. 3 |publisher=Mospat.ru |date= |accessdate=2010-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Esoteric Christianity====
The [[Rosicrucian Fellowship]] and many other [[Esoteric Christianity|Christian esoteric]] schools condemn capital punishment in all circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Heindel, Max (1910s), ''The Rosicrucian Philosophy in Questions and Answers – Volume II: [http://www.rosicrucian.com/2qa/2qaeng02.htm#question33 Question no.33: Rosicrucian Viewpoint of Capital Punishment]'', ISBN 0-911274-90-1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Rosicrucian Fellowship: ''[http://www.rosicrucian.com/zineen/pamen032.htm Obsession, Occult Effects of Capital Punishment]''&lt;/ref&gt;

      <comment>/* Cultural movements */[[WP:AWB/T|Typo fixing]], replaced: artform → art form using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Unreferenced|date=May 2010}}

A '''cultural movement''' is a change in the way a number of different disciplines approach their work. This embodies all [[art]] forms, the [[science]]s, and [[philosophies]]. Historically, different nations or regions of the world have gone through their own independent sequence of movements in culture, but as world communications have accelerated this geographical distinction has become less distinct. When cultural movements go through revolutions from one to the next, genres tend to get attacked and mixed up, and often new genres are generated and old ones fade. These changes are often reactions against the prior cultural form, which typically has grown stale and repetitive. An obsession emerges among the mainstream with the new movement, and the old one falls into neglect - sometimes it dies out entirely, but often it chugs along favored in a few disciplines and occasionally making reappearances (sometimes prefixed with &quot;neo-&quot;).

There is continual argument over the precise definition of each of these periods, and one historian might group them differently, or choose different names or descriptions. As well, even though in many cases the popular change from one to the next can be swift and sudden, the beginning and end of movements are somewhat subjective, as the movements did not spring fresh into existence out of the blue and did not come to an abrupt end and lose total support, as would be suggested by a date range. Thus use of the term &quot;period&quot; is somewhat deceptive. &quot;Period&quot; also suggests a linearity of development, whereas it has not been uncommon for two or more distinctive cultural approaches to be active at the same time. Historians will be able to find distinctive traces of a cultural movement before its accepted beginning, and there will always be new creations in old forms. So it can be more useful to think in terms of broad &quot;movements&quot; that have rough beginnings and endings. Yet for historical perspective, some rough date ranges will be provided for each to indicate the &quot;height&quot; or accepted timespan of the movement.

&lt;!-- NOTE: I'm including the sub-sections (the isms) *only* for organizational purposes since in most cases Wikipedia does not have articles on the various sections/periods/movements/whatever. Similarly for calling out the different cultural forms - art, architecture, philosophy, etc. I also think it is worthwhile to include short descriptions of each movement for similar reasons. The purpose of this page is to help get these areas of Wikipedia filled in - hopefully by folks more knowledgeable in the particular topics than I! --&gt;
==Cultural movements==
* [[Graeco-Roman]]
** The [[ancient Greece|Greek]] culture marked a departure from the other Mediterranean cultures that preceded and surrounded it. The [[ancient Rome|Romans]] adopted Greek and other styles, and spread the result throughout Europe and the [[Middle East]]. Together, Greek and Roman thought in philosophy, religion, science, history, and all forms of thought can be viewed as a central underpinning of [[Western culture]], and is therefore termed the &quot;Classical period&quot; by some. Others might divide it into the [[Hellenistic]] period and the Roman period, or might choose other finer divisions.
:: See: [[Classical architecture]] — [[Classical sculpture]] — [[Architecture of Ancient Greece|Greek architecture]] — [[Hellenistic architecture]] — [[Ionic order|Ionic]] — [[Doric order|Doric]] — [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] — [[Stoicism]] — [[Cynics|Cynicism]] — [[Epicurean]] — [[Roman architecture]] — [[Early Christian]] — [[Neoplatonism]]
* [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] (11th century &amp; 12th centuries)
** A style (esp. architectural) similar in form and materials to Roman styles. Romanesque seems to be the first pan-European style since Roman Imperial Architecture and examples are found in every part of the continent.
:: See: [[Romanesque architecture]] — [[Ottonian Art]]
* [[Gothic art|Gothic]] (mid 12th cy until mid 15th cy)
: &lt;!-- description goes here --&gt;
:: See: [[Gothic architecture]] — [[Gregorian chant]] — [[Neoplatonism]]
* [[Nominalism]]
&lt;!--Can someone well versed in medieval history help figure out how/where this fits in? --&gt;
** Rejects [[Platonic realism]] as a requirement for thinking and speaking in general terms.
* [[Renaissance humanism|Humanism]] (16th century)
&lt;!-- description goes here --&gt;
* [[Renaissance]]
** The use of light, shadow, and perspective to more accurately represent life. Because of how fundamentally these ideas were felt to alter so much of life, some have referred to it as the &quot;Golden Age&quot;. In reality it was less an &quot;Age&quot; and more of a movement in popular philosophy, science, and thought that spread over Europe (and probably other parts of the world), over time, and affected different aspects of culture at different points in time. Very roughly, the following periods can be taken as indicative of place/time foci of the Renaissance: [[Italian Renaissance]] 1450–1550. [[Spanish Renaissance]] 1550-1587. [[English Renaissance]] 1588–1629.
* [[Mannerism]]
** Anti-classicist movement that sought to emphasize the feeling of the artist himself.
** See: [[Mannerism/Art]]
* [[Baroque]]
** Emphasizes power and authority, characterized by intricate detail and without the &quot;disturbing angst&quot; of Mannerism. Essentially is exaggerated [[Classicism]] to promote and glorify the Church and State. Occupied with notions of infinity.
** See: [[Baroque|Baroque art]] — [[Baroque music]]
* [[Rococo]]
* [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] (17th–19th centuries)
** Severe, unemotional movement recalling Roman and Greek (&quot;classical&quot;) style, reacting against the overbred Rococo style and the emotional Baroque style. It stimulated revival of classical thinking, and had especially profound effects on science and politics. Also had a direct influence on [[Academic art|Academic Art]] in the 19th century. Beginning in the early 17th century with Cartesian thought (see [[René Descartes]]), this movement provided philosophical frameworks for the natural sciences, sought to determine the principles of knowledge by rejecting all things previously believed to be known about the world. In [[Renaissance Classicism]] attempts are made to recreate the classic art forms — tragedy, comedy, and farce.
** See also: [[Weimar Classicism]]
*[[Age of Enlightenment]] (1688–1789): Reason ([[rationalism]]) seen as the ideal.
* [[Romanticism]] (1770–1830)
** Began in Germany and spread to England and France as a reaction against Neoclassicism and against the Age of Enlightenment.. The notion of &quot;folk genius&quot;, or an inborn and intuitive ability to do magnificent things, is a core principle of the Romantic movement. Nostalgia for the primitive past in preference to the scientifically minded present. Romantic heroes, exemplified by Napoleon, are popular. Fascination with the past leads to a resurrection of interest in the Gothic period. It did not really replace the Neoclassical movement so much as provide a counterbalance; many artists sought to join both styles in their works.
** See: [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]]
* [[Realism (arts)|Realism]] (1830–1905)
** Ushered in by the [[Industrial Revolution]] and growing [[Nationalism]] in the world. Began in France. Attempts to portray the speech and mannerisms of everyday people in [[everyday life]]. Tends to focus on [[middle class]] social and domestic problems. Plays by [[Ibsen]] are an example. [[Naturalism (theatre)|Naturalism]] evolved from [[Realism (theatre)|Realism]], following it briefly in art and more enduringly in theatre, film, and [[Naturalism (literature)|literature]]. [[Impressionism]], based on 'scientific' knowledge and discoveries concerns observing nature and reality objectively.
** See: [[Post-impressionism]] — [[Neo-impressionism]] — [[Pointillism]] — [[Pre-Raphaelite]]
* [[Art Nouveau]] (1880–1905)
** Decorative, symbolic art
** See: [[Transcendentalism]]
* [[Modernism]] (1880&amp;ndash;1965)
** Also known as the [[Avant-garde]] movement. Originating in the 19th century with [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]], the Modernist movement composed itself of a wide range of 'isms' that ran in contrast to Realism and that sought out the underlying fundamentals of art and philosophy. The [[Jazz Age|Jazz age]] and Hollywood emerge and have their hey-days.
** See: [[Fauvism]] &amp;mdash; [[Cubism]] &amp;mdash; [[Futurism (art)|Futurism]] &amp;mdash; [[Suprematism]] &amp;mdash; [[Dada]] &amp;mdash; [[Constructivist epistemology|Constructivism]] &amp;mdash; [[Surrealism]] &amp;mdash; [[Expressionism]] &amp;mdash; [[Existentialism]] &amp;mdash; [[Op Art]] &amp;mdash; [[Art Deco]] &amp;mdash; [[Bauhaus]] &amp;mdash; [[Neo-Plasticism]] &amp;mdash; [[Precisionism]] &amp;mdash; [[Abstract expressionism]] &amp;mdash; [[New Realism]] &amp;mdash; [[Color field painting]] &amp;mdash; [[Fluxus]] &amp;mdash; [[Hard-edge painting]] &amp;mdash; [[Pop Art]] &amp;mdash; [[Photorealism]] &amp;mdash; [[Minimalism]] &amp;mdash; [[Postminimalism]] &amp;mdash; [[Lyrical Abstraction]] &amp;mdash; [[Situationist International|Situationism]]
* [[Postmodernism]] (since c.1965)
** A reaction to Modernism, in a way, Postmodernism largely discards the notion that artists should seek pure fundamentals, often questioning whether such fundamentals even exist - or suggestion that if they do exist, they may be irrelevant. It is exemplified by movements such as [[deconstructivism]], [[conceptual art]], ''etc.''
** See: [[Postmodern philosophy]] &amp;mdash; [[Postmodern music]] &amp;mdash; [[Postmodern art]]

The '''chalcogens''' ({{IPA-en|ˈkælkədʒɨn|pron}}) are the [[chemical element]]s in [[periodic table group|group]] 16 (old-style: VIB or VIA) of the [[periodic table]]. This group is also known as the '''oxygen family'''. It consists of the elements [[oxygen]] ('''O'''), [[sulfur]] ('''S'''), [[selenium]] ('''Se'''), [[tellurium]] ('''Te'''), the radioactive element [[polonium]] ('''Po'''), and the synthetic element [[ununhexium]] ('''Uuh''').

Although all ''group 16 elements'' of the periodic table, including oxygen are defined as chalcogens,  oxygen and oxides are usually distinguished from chalcogens and [[chalcogenide]]s. The term '''chalcogenide''' is more commonly reserved for [[sulfide]]s, [[selenide]]s, and [[telluride (chemistry)|telluride]]s, rather than for [[oxide]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jchemed.chem.wisc.edu/Journal/Issues/2001/Oct/abs1333_1.html A Second Note on the Term &quot;Chalcogen&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='handbook'&gt;Francesco Devillanova (Editor) [http://books.google.com/books?id=IvGnUAaSqOsC&amp;pg=PT24 Handbook of Chalcogen Chemistry - New Perspectives in Sulfur, Selenium and Tellurium] Royal Society of Chemistry, 2007; ISBN 0854043667, 9780854043668&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='IUPAC'&gt;IUPAC goldbook [http://goldbook.iupac.org/A00266.html amides].

Although the word &quot;chalcogen&quot; is literally taken from Greek words being &quot;copper-former,&quot; the meaning is more in line with &quot;copper-ore former&quot; or more generally, &quot;ore-former.&quot; These electronegative elements are strongly associated with metal-bearing minerals, where they have formed water-insoluble compounds with the metals in the ores.

== Properties ==
Members of this group show similar patterns in their [[electron configuration]], especially the outermost shells, resulting in similar trends in chemical behavior:

Oxygen and sulfur are [[nonmetal]]s, and selenium, tellurium, and polonium are [[metalloid]] [[semiconductor]]s (that means, their electrical properties are between those of a metal and an [[electrical insulation|insulator]]). Nevertheless, tellurium, as well as selenium, is often referred to as a metal when in elemental form.

Metal chalcogenides are common as minerals. For example, [[pyrite]] (FeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is an [[iron ore]].  The rare mineral [[calaverite]] is the ditelluride AuTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

The formal [[oxidation number]] of the most common chalcogen compounds is −2. Other values, such as −1 in [[pyrite]], can be attained.  The highest formal [[oxidation number]] +6 is found in [[sulfate]]s, [[selenate]]s and [[tellurate]]s, such as in [[sulfuric acid]] or sodium selenate (Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SeO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;).

==Etymology==
The name ''chalcogen'' comes from the Greek words ''χαλκος'' (chalkos, literally &quot;copper&quot;), and ''γενές'' (genes, born&lt;ref&gt;Online Etymology Dictionary [http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=-gen -gen]&lt;/ref&gt;, gender, kindle). Thus the chalcogens bear copper. It was first used around 1930 by [[Wilhelm Biltz]]'s group at the [[University of Hanover]], where it was proposed by a man named Werner Fischer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Werner Fischer|title=A Second Note on the Term &quot;Chalcogen&quot;|journal=Journal of Chemical Education|year=2001|volume=78|issue=10|pages=1333|doi=10.1021/ed078p1333.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the literal meanings of the Greek words imply that ''chalcogen'' means &quot;copper-former&quot;, this is misleading because the chalcogens have nothing to do with copper in particular. &quot;Ore-former&quot; has been suggested as a better translation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=William B. Jensen|journal=Journal of Chemical Education|year=1997|volume=74|issue=9|pages=1063|doi=10.1021/ed074p1063|title=A Note on the Term &quot;Chalcogen&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt; wherefore both the vast majority of metal ores are chalcogenides and the word ''χαλκος'' in ancient Greek was associated with metals and metal-bearing rock in general; copper, and its alloy [[bronze]], was one of the first metals to be used by humans.

'''Carbon dioxide''' ([[chemical formula]] '''CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''') is a [[chemical compound]] composed of two [[oxygen]] [[atom]]s [[covalent bond|covalently bonded]] to a single [[carbon]] atom. It is a [[gas]] at [[standard temperature and pressure]] and exists in [[Earth's atmosphere]] in this state. CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is a [[trace gas]] comprising 0.039% of the atmosphere.

As part of the [[carbon cycle]] known as [[photosynthesis]], [[plant]]s, [[algae]], and [[cyanobacteria]] absorb carbon dioxide, [[sunlight]], and [[water]] to produce [[carbohydrate]] [[energy]] for themselves and [[oxygen]] as a waste product. By contrast, during [[Cellular respiration|respiration]] they ''emit'' carbon dioxide, as do all other living things that depend either directly or indirectly on plants for food. Carbon dioxide is also generated as a by-product of [[combustion]]; emitted from [[volcano]]es, [[hot springs]], and [[geysers]]; and freed from [[carbonate rock]]s by [[dissolution]].

{{As of|2010|10}}, [[carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere]] is at a concentration of 388 [[parts per million|ppm]] by [[volume]].&lt;ref&gt;[ftp://ftp.cmdl.noaa.gov/ccg/co2/trends/co2_mm_mlo.txt Mauna Loa CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; annual mean data] from NOAA. &quot;Trend&quot; data was used. See also: [http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/trends/ Trends in Carbon Dioxide] from NOAA.&lt;/ref&gt; Atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide fluctuate slightly with the change of the seasons, driven primarily by seasonal plant growth in the [[Northern Hemisphere]]. Concentrations of carbon dioxide fall during the northern spring and summer as plants consume the gas, and rise during the northern autumn and winter as plants go dormant, die and decay. Taking all this into account, the concentration of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; grew by about 2 ppm in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/trends/#mlo_growth|title=Annual Mean Growth Rate for Mauna Loa, Hawaii|work=Trends in Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide|publisher=NOAA Earth System Research Laboratory|accessdate=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carbon dioxide is a [[greenhouse gas]] as it transmits [[visible spectrum|visible light]] but absorbs strongly in the [[infrared]] and [[near-infrared]].

Before the advent of human-caused release of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, concentrations tended to increase with increasing global temperatures, acting as a [[positive feedback]] for changes induced by other processes such as [[Milankovitch cycles|orbital cycles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite doi | 10.1038/329414a0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  There is a seasonal cycle in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration associated primarily with the Northern Hemisphere growing season.&lt;ref&gt;Enting, I.G., 1987: Interannual variation in the seasonal cycle of carbon dioxide concentration at Mauna Loa. ''Journal of Geophysical Research'' 92:D5, 5497–5504.&lt;/ref&gt;

Carbon dioxide has no liquid state at pressures below {{convert|5.1|atm|lk=in}}. At 1 atmosphere (near mean sea level pressure), the gas [[deposition (physics)|deposits]] directly to a solid at temperatures below {{convert|-78|C|F K}} and the solid [[sublimation (chemistry)|sublimes]] directly to a gas above −78 °C. In its solid state, carbon dioxide is commonly called [[dry ice]]. 

CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is an [[acidic oxide]]: an aqueous solution turns [[litmus test (chemistry)|litmus]] from blue to pink. It is the [[anhydride]] of [[carbonic acid]], an acid which is unstable in aqueous solution, from which it cannot be concentrated. In organisms carbonic acid production is catalysed by the [[enzyme]], [[carbonic anhydrase]].

CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is toxic in higher concentrations: 1% (10,000 ppm) will make some people feel drowsy.&lt;ref name=friedman/&gt; Concentrations of 7% to 10% cause dizziness, headache, visual and hearing dysfunction, and unconsciousness within a few minutes to an hour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency: |url=http://www.epa.gov/ozone/snap/fire/co2/co2report.html |title=Carbon Dioxide as a Fire Suppressant: Examining the Risks}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chemical and physical properties==

[[File:Carbon dioxide pressure-temperature phase diagram.svg|left|thumb|220px|Carbon dioxide pressure-temperature phase diagram showing the [[triple point]] and [[Critical point (thermodynamics)|critical point]] of carbon dioxide]]

{{details|Carbon dioxide (data page)}}Carbon dioxide is colorless. At low concentrations, the gas is odorless. At higher concentrations it has a sharp, acidic odor. It can cause asphyxiation and irritation. When inhaled at concentrations much higher than usual atmospheric levels, it can produce a sour taste in the mouth and a stinging sensation in the nose and throat. These effects result from the gas dissolving in the [[mucous membranes]] and [[saliva]], forming a weak solution of [[carbonic acid]]. This sensation can also occur during an attempt to stifle a burp after drinking a [[Carbonation|carbonated beverage]]. Amounts above 5,000 ppm are considered very unhealthy, and those above about 50,000 ppm (equal to 5% by volume) are considered dangerous to animal life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Staff|date= 16 August 2006|url = http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/idlh/124389.html|title = Carbon dioxide: IDLH Documentation|publisher = National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|accessdate = 2007-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|standard temperature and pressure]], the density of carbon dioxide is around 1.98&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, about 1.5 times that of [[Earth's atmosphere|air]]. The carbon dioxide molecule (O=C=O) contains two [[covalent bond|double bonds]] and has a linear shape. It has no electrical [[dipole]], and as it is fully [[Redox|oxidized]], it is moderately [[Chemical reaction|reactive]] and is non-flammable, but will support the combustion of metals such as [[magnesium]].

Above −78.51° [[Celsius|C]] or −109.3° [[Fahrenheit|F]], carbon dioxide changes directly from a solid phase to a gaseous phase through [[sublimation (chemistry)|sublimation]], or from gaseous to solid through [[Deposition (chemistry)|deposition]]. Solid carbon dioxide is commonly called &quot;[[dry ice]]&quot;, a [[generic trademark]]. It was first observed in 1825 by the French chemist [[Charles Thilorier]]. Dry ice is commonly used as a cooling agent, and it is relatively inexpensive. A convenient property for this purpose is that solid carbon dioxide sublimes directly into the gas phase, leaving no liquid. It can often be found in grocery stores and laboratories and is also used in the shipping industry. The largest non-cooling use for dry ice is [[Dry ice blasting|blast cleaning]].

Liquid carbon dioxide forms only at [[pressure]]s above 5.1 atm; the [[triple point]] of carbon dioxide is about 518 [[kPa]] at −56.6 °C (see phase diagram, above). The [[Critical point (thermodynamics)|critical point]] is 7.38 MPa at 31.1 °C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webbook.nist.gov/cgi/cbook.cgi?ID=C124389&amp;Units=SI&amp;Mask=4#Thermo-Phase|title=Phase change data for Carbon dioxide|publisher=National Institute of Standards and Technology|accessdate=2008-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Solid carbon dioxide, an [[amorphous]] glass-like solid, is known, although not at atmospheric pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Santoro|first=M.|year=2006|title=Amorphous silica-like carbon dioxide|journal=Nature|volume=441|pages=857–860|doi=10.1038/nature04879|pmid=16778885|last2=Gorelli|first2=FA|last3=Bini|first3=R|last4=Ruocco|first4=G|last5=Scandolo|first5=S|last6=Crichton|first6=WA|issue=7095}}&lt;/ref&gt; This form of glass, called [[amorphous carbonia|''carbonia'']], was produced by [[supercooling]] heated CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at extreme pressure (40–48 [[GPa]] or about 400,000 atmospheres) in a [[diamond anvil]]. This discovery confirmed the theory that carbon dioxide could exist in a glass state similar to other members of its elemental family, like [[silicon]] ([[silica|silica glass]]) and [[germanium]]. Unlike silica and germania glasses, however, carbonia glass is not stable at normal pressures and reverts back to gas when pressure is released.

==History==
[[File:Carbon-dioxide-crystal-3D-vdW.png|thumb|left|220px|Crystal structure of dry ice]]
Carbon dioxide was one of the first gases to be described as a substance distinct from air. In the seventeenth century, the [[Flemish people|Flemish]] chemist [[Jan Baptist van Helmont]] observed that when he burned [[charcoal]] in a closed vessel, the mass of the resulting ash was much less than that of the original charcoal. His interpretation was that the rest of the charcoal had been transmuted into an invisible substance he termed a &quot;gas&quot; or &quot;wild spirit&quot; (''spiritus sylvestre'').{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

The properties of carbon dioxide were studied more thoroughly in the 1750s by the Scottish physician [[Joseph Black]]. He found that [[limestone]] ([[calcium carbonate]]) could be heated or treated with [[acid]]s to yield a gas he called &quot;fixed air.&quot; He observed that the fixed air was denser than air and supported neither flame nor animal life. Black also found that when bubbled through an aqueous solution of lime ([[calcium hydroxide]]), it would [[Precipitation (chemistry)|precipitate]] calcium carbonate. He used this phenomenon to illustrate that carbon dioxide is produced by animal respiration and microbial fermentation. In 1772, English chemist [[Joseph Priestley]] published a paper entitled ''Impregnating Water with Fixed Air'' in which he described a process of dripping [[sulfuric acid]] (or ''oil of vitriol'' as Priestley knew it) on chalk in order to produce carbon dioxide, and forcing the gas to dissolve by agitating a bowl of water in contact with the gas.&lt;ref name=&quot;Priestley&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|first = Joseph|last = Priestley|authorlink = Joseph Priestley|title = Observations on Different Kinds of Air|journal = Philosophical Transactions|volume = 62|issue = 0|year = 1772|pages = 147–264|url = http://web.lemoyne.edu/~GIUNTA/priestley.html|doi = 10.1098/rstl.1772.0021|last2 =Hey|first2 = Wm}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the invention of [[Soda water]].

Carbon dioxide was first liquefied (at elevated pressures) in 1823 by [[Humphry Davy]] and [[Michael Faraday]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Davy&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|first = Humphry|last = Davy|authorlink = Humphry Davy|title = On the Application of Liquids Formed by the Condensation of Gases as Mechanical Agents|journal = Philosophical Transactions|volume = 113|issue = 0|year = 1823|pages = 199–205|doi = 10.1098/rstl.1823.0020 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest description of solid carbon dioxide was given by [[Charles Thilorier]], who in 1834 opened a pressurized container of liquid carbon dioxide, only to find that the cooling produced by the rapid evaporation of the liquid yielded a &quot;snow&quot; of solid CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Thilorier and the First Solidification of a &quot;Permanent&quot; Gas (1835)|last = Duane|first = H.D.

==Isolation and production==
Carbon dioxide can be obtained by or from air [[distillation]], however, this method is inefficient. A variety of chemical routes to carbon dioxide are known, such as the reaction between most acids and most metal carbonates. For example, the reaction between [[hydrochloric acid]] and calcium carbonate (limestone or chalk) is depicted below:

: {{chem|2 HCl|| + CaCO|3| → CaCl|2| + H|2|CO|3}}

The [[carbonic acid]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) then decomposes to water and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Such reactions are accompanied by foaming or bubbling, or both. In industry such reactions are widespread because they can be used to neutralize waste acid streams.

The production of [[quicklime]] (CaO), a chemical that has widespread use, from limestone by heating at about 850 °C also produces CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;:
: {{chem|CaCO|3| → CaO + CO|2}}

The [[combustion]] of all carbon containing fuels, such as [[methane]] ([[natural gas]]), petroleum distillates ([[gasoline]], [[Diesel fuel|diesel]], [[kerosene]], [[propane]]), but also of coal and wood, will yield carbon dioxide and, in most cases, water. As an example the chemical reaction between methane and oxygen is given below.

: {{chem|CH|4| + 2 O|2| → CO|2| + 2 H|2|O}}

[[Iron]] is reduced from its oxides with [[coke (fuel)|coke]] in a [[blast furnace]], producing [[pig iron]] and carbon dioxide:&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Yeast]] metabolizes [[sugar]] to produce carbon dioxide and [[ethanol]], also known as alcohol, in the production of wines, beers and other spirits, but also in the production of [[bioethanol]]:

: {{chem|C|6|H|12|O|6}} → {{chem|2 CO|2| + 2 C|2|H|5|OH}}

All [[cellular respiration|aerobic]] organisms produce {{chem|CO|2}} when they oxidize [[carbohydrate]]s, [[fatty acid]]s, and proteins in the mitochondria of cells. The large number of reactions involved are exceedingly complex and not described easily. Refer to ([[cellular respiration]], [[anaerobic respiration]] and [[photosynthesis]]). [[Photoautotrophs]] (i.e. plants, [[cyanobacteria]]) use another ''modus operandi'': Plants absorb {{chem|CO|2}} from the air, and, together with water, react it to form carbohydrates:

: ''n''CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ''n''{{chem|H|2}}O → ({{chem|CH|2|O}})&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; + ''n''{{chem|O|2}}

Carbon dioxide is [[soluble]] in water, in which it spontaneously interconverts between CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and {{chem|H|2|CO|3}} ([[carbonic acid]]). The relative concentrations of {{chem|CO|2|, H|2|CO|3}}, and the deprotonated forms {{chem|HCO|3|−}} ([[bicarbonate]]) and {{chem|CO|3|2−}}([[carbonate]]) depend on the [[pH]]. In neutral or slightly alkaline water (pH &gt; 6.5), the bicarbonate form predominates (&gt;50%) becoming the most prevalent (&gt;95%) at the pH of seawater, while in very alkaline water (pH &gt; 10.4) the predominant (&gt;50%) form is carbonate. The bicarbonate and carbonate forms are very soluble, such that air-equilibrated ocean water (mildly alkaline with typical pH = 8.2 – 8.5) contains about 120&amp;nbsp;mg of bicarbonate per liter.

===Industrial production===
Industrial carbon dioxide is produced mainly from six processes:&lt;ref name=&quot;kirk&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title = Carbon Dioxide|first = Ronald|last = Pierantozzi|encyclopedia = Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology|publisher = Wiley|year = 2001|doi = 10.1002/0471238961.0301180216090518.a01.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Directly from natural carbon dioxide [[spring (hydrosphere)|springs]], where it is produced by the action of acidified water on [[limestone]] or [[dolomite]].
* As a by-product of [[hydrogen production]] plants, where methane is converted to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;;
* From combustion of [[fossil fuel]]s and [[wood]];
* As a by-product of [[Fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] of [[sugar]] in the [[brewing]] of [[beer]], [[whisky]] and other [[alcohol]]ic [[beverage]]s;
* From thermal decomposition of limestone, {{chem|CaCO|3}}, in the manufacture of lime ([[Calcium oxide]], {{chem|CaO}});

==Uses==
[[File:Soda bubbles macro.jpg|thumb|250px|Carbon dioxide bubbles in a soft drink.]]

Carbon dioxide is used by the food industry, the oil industry, and the chemical industry.&lt;ref name=&quot;kirk&quot; /&gt; It is used in many consumer products that require pressurized gas because it is inexpensive and nonflammable, and because it undergoes a phase transition from gas to liquid at room temperature at an attainable pressure of approximately 60 [[Bar (unit)|bar]] (870 psi, 59 atm), allowing far more carbon dioxide to fit in a given container than otherwise would. Life jackets often contain canisters of pressured carbon dioxide for quick inflation. Aluminum capsules of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are also sold as supplies of compressed gas for [[Air gun|airguns]], [[paintball]] markers, inflating bicycle tires, and for making [[carbonated water]]. Rapid vaporization of liquid carbon dioxide is used for blasting in coal mines. High concentrations of carbon dioxide can also be used to kill pests.

===Foods===
A candy called [[Pop Rocks]] is pressurized with carbon dioxide gas at about 40 bar (580 psi). When placed in the mouth, it dissolves (just like other hard candy) and releases the gas bubbles with an audible pop.

[[Leavening agent]]s produce carbon dioxide to cause dough to rise. [[Baker's yeast]] produces carbon dioxide by fermentation of sugars within the dough, while chemical leaveners such as [[baking powder]] and [[baking soda]] release carbon dioxide when heated or if exposed to [[acid]]s.

====Beverages====
Carbon dioxide is used to produce [[carbonation|carbonated]] [[soft drinks]] and [[soda water]]. Traditionally, the carbonation in beer and sparkling wine came about through natural fermentation, but many manufacturers carbonate these drinks artificially. In the case of bottled and kegged beer, artificial carbonation is now the most common method used. With the exception of British [[Real Ale]], draught  beer is usually transferred from kegs in a cold room or cellar to dispensing taps on the bar using pressurized carbon dioxide, often mixed with nitrogen.

====Wine making====
Carbon dioxide in the form of [[dry ice]] is often used in the [[wine making]] process to cool down bunches of [[grape]]s quickly after picking to help prevent spontaneous [[Fermentation (wine)|fermentation]] by wild [[yeast]]s. The main advantage of using dry ice over regular water ice is that it cools the grapes without adding any additional water that may decrease the [[sugar]] concentration in the [[grape must]], and therefore also decrease the [[alcohol]] concentration in the finished wine.

Dry ice is also used during the [[cold soak]] phase of the wine making process to keep grapes cool. The carbon dioxide gas that results from the sublimation of the dry ice tends to settle to the bottom of tanks because it is heavier than air. The settled carbon dioxide gas creates a hypoxic environment which helps to prevent bacteria from growing on the grapes until it is time to start the fermentation with the desired strain of yeast.

Carbon dioxide is also used to create a hypoxic environment for [[carbonic maceration]], the process used to produce [[Beaujolais]] wine.

Carbon dioxide is sometimes used to top up wine bottles or other [[storage (wine)|storage]] vessels such as barrels to prevent oxidation, though it has the problem that it can dissolve into the wine, making a previously still wine slightly fizzy. For this reason, other gases such as [[nitrogen]] or [[argon]] are preferred for this process by professional wine makers.

===Pneumatic systems===
Carbon dioxide is one of the most commonly used compressed gases for pneumatic (pressurized gas) systems in portable pressure tools and [[Robot combat|combat robots]].

===Fire extinguisher===
Carbon dioxide extinguishes flames, and some [[Fire extinguisher#Clean agents and carbon dioxide|fire extinguishers]], especially those designed for electrical fires, contain liquid carbon dioxide under pressure. Carbon dioxide extinguishers work well on small flammable liquid and electrical fires, but not on ordinary combustible fires, as it is so dry. Carbon dioxide has also been widely used as an extinguishing agent in fixed fire protection systems for local application of specific hazards and total flooding of a protected space, (National Fire Protection Association Code 12). International Maritime Organization standards also recognize carbon dioxide systems for fire protection of ship holds and engine rooms. Carbon dioxide based fire protection systems have been linked to several deaths, because it does not support life in the concentrations used to extinguish fire (40% or so), however, it is not considered to be toxic to humans. A review of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; systems (Carbon Dioxide as a Fire Suppressant: Examining the Risks, US EPA) identified 51 incidents between 1975 and the date of the report, causing 72 deaths and 145 injuries.

===Welding===
Carbon dioxide also finds use as an atmosphere for [[welding]], although in the welding arc, it reacts to [[oxidation|oxidize]] most metals. Use in the automotive industry is common despite significant evidence that welds made in carbon dioxide are more [[brittle]] than those made in more inert atmospheres, and that such weld joints deteriorate over time because of the formation of carbonic acid. It is used as a welding gas primarily because it is much less expensive than more inert gases such as [[argon]] or [[helium]].

When used for MIG welding, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; use is sometimes referred to as MAG welding, for Metal Active Gas, as CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can react at these high temperatures. It tends to produce a hotter puddle than truly inert atmospheres, improving the flow characteristics. Although, this may be due to atmospheric reactions occurring at the puddle site. This is usually the opposite of the desired effect when welding, as it tends to embrittle the site, but may not be a problem for general mild steel welding, where ultimate ductility is not a major concern.

===Pharmaceutical and other chemical processing===
Liquid carbon dioxide is a good [[solvent]] for many [[lipophilic]] [[organic chemistry|organic compounds]] and is used to remove [[caffeine]] from [[coffee]].  Carbon dioxide has attracted attention in the [[pharmaceutical]] and other chemical processing industries as a less toxic alternative to more traditional solvents such as [[organochloride]]s. It is used by some [[dry cleaning|dry cleaners]] for this reason. (See [[green chemistry]].)

Carbon dioxide is used as an ingredient in the production of [[urea]], [[carbonate]]s and [[bicarbonate]]s, and [[sodium salicylate]].&lt;ref&gt;M. Aresta (Ed.) &quot;Carbon Dioxide as a Chemical Feedstock&quot; 2010, Wiley-VCH: Weinheim. ISBN 978-3-527-32475-0&lt;/ref&gt; Carbon dioxide is known to react with [[Grignard reagent]]s to form [[carboxylic acid]]s. In a [[metal carbon dioxide complex]]es, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; serves as a ligand, which can facilitate the conversion of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to other chemicals.

===Agricultural and biological applications===
Plants require carbon dioxide to conduct [[photosynthesis]]. Greenhouses may (if of large size, must) enrich their atmospheres with [[Carbonic fertilization|additional CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] to sustain and increase plant growth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ext.colostate.edu/mg/gardennotes/141.html Plant Growth Factors: Photosynthesis, Respiration, and Transpiration]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imok.ufl.edu/veghort/docs/physio_121202b.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/nature/node21.html Carbon dioxide&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; A [[photosynthesis]]-related drop (by a factor less than two) in carbon dioxide concentration in a greenhouse compartment would kill green plants, or, at least, completely stop their growth. At very high concentrations (a factor of 100 or more higher than its atmospheric concentration), carbon dioxide can be toxic to animal life, so raising the concentration to 10,000 ppm (1%) or higher for several hours will eliminate pests such as [[whitefly|whiteflies]] and [[spider mite]]s in a greenhouse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Stafford, Ned|title=Future crops: The other greenhouse effect|journal=Nature|volume=448|page=7153|year=2007|doi=10.1038/448526a|pmid=17671477|issue=7153}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Carbon dioxide is used in greenhouses as the main carbon source for ''[[Spirulina (genus)|Spirulina]]'' algae.

In medicine, up to 5% carbon dioxide (130 times the atmospheric concentration) is added to [[oxygen]] for stimulation of breathing after [[apnea]] and to stabilize the {{chem|O|2|/CO|2}} balance in blood.

It has been proposed that carbon dioxide from power generation be bubbled into ponds to grow algae that could then be converted into [[biodiesel]] fuel.&lt;ref name='csmon'&gt;{{cite news|first=Mark|last=Clayton|title=Algae – like a breath mint for smokestacks|date=2006-01-11| url =http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0111/p01s03-sten.html|work =[[Christian Science Monitor]]| accessdate = 2007-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lasers===
[[File:Carbon Dioxide Laser At The Laser Effects Test Facility.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A [[carbon dioxide laser]].]]
A common type of industrial gas [[laser]] is the [[carbon dioxide laser]].

===Oil recovery===
Carbon dioxide is used in [[enhanced oil recovery]] where it is injected into or adjacent to producing oil wells, usually under [[Supercritical fluid|supercritical]] conditions. It acts as both a pressurizing agent and, when dissolved into the underground [[crude oil]], significantly reduces its viscosity, enabling the oil to flow more rapidly through the earth to the removal well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Austell |first=J Michael |year=2005 |title=CO2 for Enhanced Oil Recovery Needs – Enhanced Fiscal Incentives |journal=Exploration &amp; Production: the Oil &amp; Gas Review |url=http://www.touchoilandgas.com/enhanced-recovery-needs-enhanced-a423-1.html |accessdate= 2007-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In mature oil fields, extensive pipe networks are used to carry the carbon dioxide to the injection points.

===Refrigerant===
Liquid and solid carbon dioxide are important [[refrigerant]]s, especially in the food industry, where they are employed during the transportation and storage of ice cream and other frozen foods. Solid carbon dioxide is called &quot;dry ice&quot; and is used for small shipments where refrigeration equipment is not practical. Solid carbon dioxide is always below −78 &amp;deg;C at regular atmospheric pressure, regardless of the air temperature.

&lt;span id=&quot;R744&quot; /&gt;Liquid carbon dioxide (industry nomenclature R744 or R-744) was used as a refrigerant prior to the discovery of [[Dichlorodifluoromethane|R-12]] and may enjoy a renaissance due to fears that [[r134a]] contributes to [[climate change]]. Its physical properties are highly favorable for cooling, refrigeration, and heating purposes, having a high volumetric cooling capacity. Due to its operation at pressures of up to 130 [[Bar (unit)|bar]] (1880 [[Pounds per square inch|psi]]), CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; systems require highly resistant components that have already been developed for mass production in many sectors. In automobile air conditioning, in more than 90% of all driving conditions for latitudes higher than 50°, R744 operates more efficiently than systems using [[R-134a]]. Its environmental advantages ([[Global warming potential|GWP]] of 1, non-ozone depleting, non-toxic, non-flammable) could make it the future working fluid to replace current HFCs in cars, supermarkets, hot water heat pumps, among others. Coca-Cola has fielded CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-based beverage coolers and the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] is interested in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; refrigeration and heating technology.&lt;ref name='ccref1'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecoca-colacompany.com/presscenter/nr_20060605_corporate_hfc-free.html |title=The Coca-Cola Company Announces Adoption of HFC-Free Insulation in Refrigeration Units to Combat Global Warming |accessdate=2007-10-11 |date=2006-06-05 |publisher=The Coca-Cola Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='usforces'&gt;{{cite news|title = Modine reinforces its CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; research efforts|url = http://www.r744.com/news/news_ida145.php|date = 2007-06-28|publisher = R744.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of 2007, the global automobile industry is expected to decide on the next-generation refrigerant in car air conditioning. CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is one discussed option.(see [[The Cool War]])

===Coal bed methane recovery===
In [[enhanced coal bed methane recovery]], carbon dioxide is pumped into the coal seam to displace methane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipe.ethz.ch/laboratories/spl/research/adsorption/project03|title=Enhanced coal bed methane recovery|publisher=ETH Zurich|date=2006-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===pH control===
Carbon dioxide can be used as a mean of controlling the [[pH]] of swimming pools, by continuously adding gas to the water, thus keeping the pH level from rising. Among the advantages of this is the avoidance of handling (more hazardous) acids.

CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is also used in the keeping of [[Reef aquarium|reef aquaria]], where it is commonly used in [[calcium reactor]]s to temporarily lower the pH of water being passed over [[calcium carbonate]] in order to allow the calcium carbonate to dissolve into the water more freely where it is used by some [[corals]] to build their skeleton.

==In the Earth's atmosphere==
[[File:Mauna Loa Carbon Dioxide-en.svg|thumbnail|right|280px|The [[Keeling Curve]] of atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentrations measured at [[Mauna Loa Observatory]].]]

{{Main|Carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere}}
{{Main|Carbon cycle}}

Carbon dioxide in [[earth's atmosphere]] is considered a [[trace gas]] currently occurring at an average concentration of about 390 parts per million by volume or 591 parts per million by mass.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/trends/#mlo NOAA ESRL, Trends in Carbon Dioxide], accessed 2010.06&lt;/ref&gt; The total mass of atmospheric carbon dioxide is 3.16×10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; kg (about 3,000 gigatonnes). Its concentration varies seasonally (see graph at right) and also considerably on a regional basis, especially [[planetary boundary layer|near the ground]]. In urban areas concentrations are generally higher and indoors they can reach 10 times background levels. Carbon dioxide is a [[greenhouse gas]]. 

[[File:CO2 increase rate.png|thumb|left|Yearly increase of atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;: In the 1960s, the average annual increase was 37% of the 2000–2007 average.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Pieter Tans (3 May 2008) [ftp://ftp.cmdl.noaa.gov/ccg/co2/trends/co2_gr_mlo.txt &quot;Annual CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; mole fraction increase (ppm)&quot; for 1959–2007] [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] Earth System Research Laboratory, Global Monitoring Division ([http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/trends/ additional details].)&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Five hundred million years ago carbon dioxide was 20 times more prevalent than today, decreasing to 4–5 times during the [[Jurassic]] period and then slowly declining with [[Azolla Event|a particularly swift reduction]] occurring 49 million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Climate and CO2 in the Atmosphere|url=http://earthguide.ucsd.edu/virtualmuseum/climatechange2/07_1.shtml| accessdate=2007-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

Up to 40% of the gas emitted by some [[volcano]]es during [[subaerial eruption]]s is carbon dioxide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Sigurdsson |first=Haraldur |coauthors=Houghton, B.

Carbon dioxide is also produced by hot springs such as those at the Bossoleto site near [[Rapolano Terme]] in [[Tuscany]], [[Italy]]. Here, in a bowl-shaped depression of about 100 m diameter, local concentrations of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; rise to above 75% overnight, sufficient to kill insects and small animals, but it warms rapidly when sunlit and the gas is dispersed by convection during the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=van Gardingen |first=P.R. |coauthors=Grace, J.; Jeffree, C.E.; Byari, S.H.; Miglietta, F.; Raschi, A.; Bettarini, I. |chapter=Long-term effects of enhanced CO2 concentrations on leaf gas exchange: research opportunities using CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; springs |title=Plant responses to elevated CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;: Evidence from natural springs |editor=Raschi, A.; Miglietta, F.; Tognetti, R.; van Gardingen, P.R.

==In the oceans==
{{Main|Carbon cycle}}

There is about fifty times as much carbon dissolved in the [[sea water]] of the oceans in the form of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and carbonic acid, [[bicarbonate]] and [[carbonate]] ions as exists in the atmosphere. The oceans act as an enormous [[carbon sink]], and have taken up about a third of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emitted by human activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Doney|first = Scott C.|coauthors = Naomi M. Levine|title = How Long Can the Ocean Slow Global Warming?|publisher = Oceanus|date = 2006-11-29|url = http://www.whoi.edu/oceanus/viewArticle.do?id=17726|accessdate = 2007-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gas solubility decreases as the temperature of water increases (except when both pressure exceeds 300 bar and temperature exceeds 393 K, only found near deep geothermal vents)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Duana|first=Zhenhao|coauthors=Rui Sun|year=2003|title=An improved model calculating CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; solubility in pure water and aqueous NaCl solutions from 273 to 533 K and from 0 to 2000 bar|journal=Chemical Geology|volume=193|pages=260–271}}&lt;/ref&gt; and therefore the rate of uptake from the atmosphere decreases as ocean temperatures rise.

Most of the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; taken up by the ocean, which is about 30% of the total released into the atmosphere,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite doi|10.1126/science.1189338}}&lt;/ref&gt; forms carbonic acid in equilibrium with bicarbonate and carbonate ions. Some is consumed in photosynthesis by organisms in the water, and a small proportion of that sinks and leaves the carbon cycle. Increased CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the atmosphere has led to decreasing [[alkalinity]] of seawater and there is concern that this may adversely affect organisms living in the water. In particular, with decreasing alkalinity, the availability of carbonates for forming shells decreases,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Oceanography: An Invitation to Marine Science |last= Garrison |first= Tom |year= 2004 |publisher= [[The Thomson Corporation|Thomson Brooks]] |isbn= 0534408877 |pages= 125}}&lt;/ref&gt; although there's evidence of increased shell production by certain species under increased CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://geology.gsapubs.org/content/37/12/1131.abstract|title = Marine calcifiers exhibit mixed responses to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-induced ocean acidification|publisher = Geology|date=2009-12-01|last = Ries|first = Justin B.|coauthors = Anne L. Cohen, Daniel C. McCorkle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NOAA states in their May 2008 &quot;State of the science fact sheet for [[ocean acidification]]&quot; that:&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;The oceans have absorbed about 50% of the carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) released from the burning of fossil fuels, resulting in chemical reactions that lower ocean pH. This has caused an increase in hydrogen ion (acidity) of about 30% since the start of the industrial age through a process known as “ocean acidification.” A growing number of studies have demonstrated adverse impacts on marine organisms, including: 
*The rate at which reef-building corals produce their skeletons decreases, while production of numerous varieties of jellyfish increases.
*The ability of marine algae and free-swimming zooplankton to maintain protective shells is reduced.
*The survival of larval marine species, including commercial fish and shellfish, is reduced.&quot;

Also, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) writes in their Climate Change 2007: Synthesis Report &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/publications_ipcc_fourth_assessment_report_synthesis_report.htm Climate Change 2007: Synthesis Report], IPCC&lt;/ref&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;The uptake of anthropogenic carbon since 1750 has led to the ocean becoming more acidic with an average decrease in pH of 0.1 units. Increasing atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentrations lead {{sic}} to further acidification […] While the effects of observed ocean acidification on the marine biosphere are as yet undocumented, the progressive acidification of oceans is expected to have negative impacts on marine shell-forming organisms (e.g. corals) and their dependent species.&quot; 

Some marine calcifying organisms (including coral reefs) have been singled out by major research agencies, including NOAA, OSPAR commission, NANOOS and the IPCC, because their most current research shows that ocean acidification should be expected to impact them negatively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pmel.noaa.gov/co2/OA/ PMEL Ocean Acidification Home Page]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biological role==
Carbon dioxide is an end product in organisms that obtain energy from breaking down sugars, fats and [[amino acid]]s with [[oxygen]] as part of their [[metabolism]], in a process known as [[cellular respiration]]. This includes all plants, animals, many fungi and some bacteria. In higher animals, the carbon dioxide travels in the blood from the body's tissues to the lungs where it is exhaled. In plants using photosynthesis, carbon dioxide is absorbed from the atmosphere.

===Photosynthesis and carbon fixation===
[[File:Auto-and heterotrophs.png|thumb|200px|Overview of photosynthesis and respiration. Carbon dioxide (at right), together with water, form oxygen and organic compounds (at left) by [[photosynthesis|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;photosynthesis&lt;/font&gt;]], which can be [[cellular respiration|&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;respired&lt;/font&gt;]] to water and (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).]]

[[Carbon fixation]] is the removal of carbon dioxide from the air and its incorporation into solid compounds. [[Plant]]s, [[algae]], and many species of [[bacteria]] ([[cyanobacteria]]) fix carbon and create their own food by [[photosynthesis]]. Photosynthesis uses carbon dioxide and [[water]] to produce [[sugar]]s and occasionally other [[organic compound]]s, releasing [[oxygen]] as a waste product. These [[phototroph]]s use the products of their photosynthesis as internal food sources and as raw material for the construction of more complex organic molecules, such as [[polysaccharides]], [[nucleic acid]]s and [[protein]]s. These are used for their own growth, and also as the basis for the [[food chain]]s and webs whereby other organisms, including animals such as ourselves, are fed. Some important phototrophs, the [[coccolithophore]]s synthesise hard [[calcium carbonate]] scales. A globally significant species of coccolithophore is ''[[Emiliania huxleyi]]'' whose [[calcite]] scales have formed the basis of many [[sedimentary rock]]s such as [[limestone]], where what was previously atmospheric carbon can remain fixed for geological timescales. 

Plants can grow up to 50 percent faster in concentrations of 1,000 ppm CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; when compared with ambient conditions, though this assumes no change in climate and no limitation on other nutrients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Carbon Dioxide In Greenhouses|last=Blom|first=T.J.|coauthors=W.A.

Plants also emit CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; during respiration, and so the majority of plants and algae, which use [[C3 photosynthesis]], are only net absorbers during the day. Though a growing forest will absorb many tons of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; each year, the World Bank writes that a mature forest will produce as much CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from respiration and decomposition of dead specimens (e.g., fallen branches) as is used in [[biosynthesis]] in growing plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2002/09/07/000094946_02081604154234/Rendered/INDEX/multi0page.txt|title=Global Environment Division Greenhouse Gas Assessment Handbook – A Practical Guidance Document for the Assessment of Project-level Greenhouse Gas Emissions|accessdate=2007-11-10|work=[[World Bank]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However six experts in biochemistry, biogeology, forestry and related areas writing in the science journal Nature that &quot;Our results demonstrate that old-growth forests can continue to accumulate carbon, contrary to the long-standing view that they are carbon neutral.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/nature07276|title=Old-growth forests as global carbon sinks|year=2008|last1=Luyssaert|first1=Sebastiaan|last2=Schulze|first2=E. -Detlef|last3=Börner|first3=Annett|last4=Knohl|first4=Alexander|last5=Hessenmöller|first5=Dominik|last6=Law|first6=Beverly E.|last7=Ciais|first7=Philippe|last8=Grace|first8=John|journal=Nature|volume=455|pages=213|pmid=18784722|issue=7210}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mature forests are valuable [[carbon sink]]s, helping maintain balance in the Earth's atmosphere.

Carbon dioxide content in fresh air (averaged between sea-level and 10 kPa level, i.e., about 30&amp;nbsp;km altitude) varies between 0.036% (360 ppm) and 0.039% (390 ppm), depending on the location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/carbontracker/|title=Graphical map of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Prolonged exposure to moderate{{Clarify|date=December 2009|reason=replace weasel words &quot;prolonged&quot; and &quot;moderate&quot; with specific duration and amount}} concentrations can cause acidosis and adverse effects on calcium phosphorus metabolism resulting in increased calcium deposits in soft tissue.

*At about '''8%''' it causes headache, sweating, dim vision, tremor and loss of consciousness after exposure for between five and ten minutes.&lt;ref name=AMSA/&gt;

Due to the health risks associated with carbon dioxide exposure, the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration says that average exposure for healthy adults during an eight-hour work day should not exceed 5,000 ppm (0.5%). The maximum safe level for infants, children, the elderly and individuals with cardio-pulmonary health issues is significantly less. For short-term (under ten minutes) exposure, the U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) and American Conference of Government Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) limit is 30,000 ppm (3%). NIOSH also states that carbon dioxide concentrations exceeding 4% are immediately dangerous to life and health&lt;ref&gt;Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Chemical Sampling Information: Carbon Dioxide.

Adaptation to increased levels of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; occurs in humans. Continuous inhalation of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can be tolerated at three percent inspired concentrations for at least one month and four percent inspired concentrations for over a week. It was suggested that 2.0 percent inspired concentrations could be used for closed air spaces (e.g. a [[submarine]]) since the adaptation is physiological and reversible.

These figures are valid for pure carbon dioxide. In indoor spaces occupied by people the carbon dioxide concentration will reach higher levels than in pure outdoor air. Concentrations higher than 1,000 ppm will cause discomfort in more than 20% of occupants, and the discomfort will increase with increasing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration. The discomfort will be caused by various gases coming from human respiration and perspiration, and not by CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; itself. At 2,000 ppm the majority of occupants will feel a significant degree of discomfort, and many will develop nausea and headaches. The CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration between 300 and 2,500 ppm is used as an indicator of indoor air quality.

Acute carbon dioxide toxicity is sometimes known by the names given to it by miners: [[blackdamp]] (also called ''choke damp'' or ''stythe''). Blackdamp is primarily nitrogen and carbon dioxide and kills via suffocation (having displaced oxygen). [[Miners]] would try to alert themselves to dangerous levels of blackdamp and other gasses in a mine shaft by bringing a caged canary with them as they worked. The canary is more sensitive to environmental gasses than humans and as it became unconscious would stop singing and fall off its perch. The [[Davy lamp]] could also detect high levels of blackdamp (which collect near the floor) by burning less brightly, while [[methane]], another suffocating gas and explosion risk would make the lamp burn more brightly).

Carbon dioxide differential above outdoor levels at steady state conditions (when the occupancy and ventilation system operation are sufficiently long that CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration has stabilized) are sometimes used to estimate ventilation rates per person. CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is considered to be a surrogate for human bio-effluents and may correlate with other indoor pollutants. Higher CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentrations are associated with occupant health, comfort and performance degradation. [[ASHRAE]] Standard 62.1–2007 ventilation rates may result in indoor levels up to 2,100 ppm above ambient outdoor conditions. Thus if the outdoor ambient is 400 ppm, indoor levels may reach 2,500 ppm with ventilation rates that meet this industry consensus standard. Levels in poorly ventilated spaces can be found even higher than this (range of 3,000 or 4,000). [Mendell and Shendell references]

===Human physiology===
{{See also|Arterial blood gas}}

CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is carried in blood in three different ways. (The exact percentages vary depending whether it is arterial or venous blood).

*Most of it (about 70% to 80%) is converted to [[bicarbonate]] ions {{chem|HCO|3|−}} by the enzyme [[carbonic anhydrase]] in the red blood cells,&lt;ref name='solarnav'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.solarnavigator.net/solar_cola/carbon_dioxide.htm |title=Carbon dioxide |accessdate=2007-10-12 |work=solarnavigator.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the reaction CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + {{chem|HCO|3|−}}.
*5% – 10% is dissolved in the [[Blood plasma|plasma]]&lt;ref name='solarnav' /&gt;
*5% – 10% is bound to [[hemoglobin]] as [[carbamino]] compounds&lt;ref name='solarnav' /&gt;

[[Hemoglobin]], the main oxygen-carrying molecule in [[red blood cell]]s, carries both oxygen and carbon dioxide. However, the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; bound to hemoglobin does not bind to the same site as oxygen. Instead, it combines with the N-terminal groups on the four globin chains. However, because of [[allosteric regulation|allosteric]] effects on the hemoglobin molecule, the binding of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; decreases the amount of oxygen that is bound for a given partial pressure of oxygen. The decreased binding to carbon dioxide in the blood due to increased oxygen levels is known as the [[Haldane Effect]], and is important in the transport of carbon dioxide from the tissues to the lungs. Conversely, a rise in the partial pressure of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or a lower pH will cause offloading of oxygen from hemoglobin, which is known as the [[Bohr Effect]].

Carbon dioxide is one of the mediators of local [[autoregulation]] of blood supply. If its levels are high, the [[capillaries]] expand to allow a greater blood flow to that tissue.

Bicarbonate ions are crucial for regulating blood pH. A person's breathing rate influences the level of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in their blood. Breathing that is too slow or shallow causes [[respiratory acidosis]], while breathing that is too rapid leads to [[hyperventilation]], which can cause [[alkalosis|respiratory alkalosis]].

Although the body requires oxygen for metabolism, low oxygen levels normally do not stimulate breathing. Rather, breathing is stimulated by higher carbon dioxide levels. As a result, breathing low-pressure air or a gas mixture with no oxygen at all (such as pure nitrogen) can lead to loss of consciousness without ever experiencing [[air hunger]]. This is especially perilous for high-altitude fighter pilots. It is also why flight attendants instruct passengers, in case of loss of cabin pressure, to apply the oxygen mask to themselves first before helping others; otherwise, one risks losing consciousness.&lt;ref name='solarnav' /&gt;

The respiratory centers try to maintain an arterial CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; pressure of 40&amp;nbsp;mm Hg. With intentional hyperventilation, the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; content of arterial blood may be lowered to 10–20&amp;nbsp;mm Hg (the oxygen content of the blood is little affected), and the respiratory drive is diminished. This is why one can hold one's breath longer after hyperventilating than without hyperventilating. This carries the risk that unconsciousness may result before the need to breathe becomes overwhelming, which is why hyperventilation is particularly dangerous before free diving.

Breathing produces approximately 2.3 pounds (1&amp;nbsp;kg) of carbon dioxide per day per person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/fq/emissions.html#q7|title=How much carbon dioxide do humans contribute through breathing?|accessdate=2009-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Cheers''''' is an American [[situation comedy]] television series that ran for 11 seasons from 1982 to 1993. It was produced by [[Charles/Burrows/Charles Productions]], in association with [[Paramount Television|Paramount Network Television]] for [[NBC]], and was created by the team of [[James Burrows]], [[Glen Charles]], and [[Les Charles]]. The show is set in the Cheers [[bar (establishment)|bar]] (named for the [[Toast (honor)|toast]] &quot;Cheers&quot;) in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], where a group of locals meet to drink, relax, chat and have fun. The show's [[theme song]], written and performed by [[Gary Portnoy]], and co-written with Judy Hart Angelo, lent its famous refrain, &quot;[[Where Everybody Knows Your Name]]&quot;, as the show's [[tagline]].&lt;ref&gt;Gary Portnoy (2006). [http://www.garyportnoy.com/ Portnoy's personal site]&lt;/ref&gt;

After premiering on September 30, 1982, it was nearly canceled during its first season when it ranked last in ratings for its premiere (77th out of 77 shows).&lt;ref name=&quot;toastingcheers&quot;&gt;{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/?id=hKbxOW2ONGEC&amp;pg=PA15&amp;lpg=PA15&amp;dq=cheers+ranked+77th| title = Toasting Cheers: An Episode Guide to the 1982–1993 Comedy Series, with cast biographies and character profiles | first = Dennis A. | last = Bjorklund | publisher = McFarland &amp; Company, Inc., Jefferson, North Carolina | year = 1997 | isbn = 978-0899509624 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Cheers'', however, eventually became a [[Nielsen ratings|highly rated]] [[television]] show in the United States, earning a top-ten rating during 8 of its 11 seasons, including one season at #1. The show spent most of its run on NBC's &quot;[[Must See TV|Must See Thursday]]&quot; lineup. Its [[List of most-watched television broadcasts|widely watched]] [[series finale]] was broadcast on May 20, 1993. The show's 270 [[List of Cheers episodes|episodes]] have been successfully [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] worldwide, and have earned 28 [[Emmy Award]]s from a then-record 117 nominations. The character [[Frasier Crane]], played by [[Kelsey Grammer]], was featured in his own successful [[List of television spin-offs|spin-off]], ''[[Frasier]]'', which also ran for 11 seasons and included guest appearances by virtually all of the major, and some minor, ''Cheers'' characters. The only exceptions to this were [[Kirstie Alley]] and the deceased [[Nicholas Colasanto]].

==Cast==
''Cheers'' maintained an [[ensemble cast]], keeping roughly the same set of characters for the entire run, with one notable exception. Numerous secondary characters and love interests appeared intermittently to complement story lines that generally revolved around this core group.

The character of [[Sam Malone]] was originally intended to be a retired [[American Football|football]] player and was slated to be played by [[Fred Dryer]], but after casting Ted Danson it was decided that a former baseball player (Sam &quot;Mayday&quot; Malone) would be more believable, given Danson's slimmer physique.&lt;ref&gt;TV1 (2006). [http://www.tv1.com.au/show.asp?id=17&amp;content=trivia TV1&amp;nbsp;– ''Cheers'']&lt;/ref&gt; The character of [[Cliff Clavin]] was created for John Ratzenberger after he auditioned for the role of [[Norm Peterson]], which eventually went to George Wendt. While chatting with producers afterward, he asked if they were going to include a &quot;bar know-it-all&quot;, the part which he eventually played.&lt;ref&gt;Newport Under the Stars (2005)(2006). [http://web.archive.org/web/20071114112730/http://newportunderthestars.com/newport/johnsbio.html John Ratzenberger's Newport Under the Stars]&lt;/ref&gt; Kirstie Alley joined the cast when [[Shelley Long]] left (representing the only departure of a primary character throughout the series), and Woody Harrelson joined when Nicholas Colasanto died. Danson, Wendt and Rhea Perlman were the only actors to appear in every episode of the series.&lt;ref name=&quot;trivia&quot;&gt;IMDb (2006). [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083399/trivia IMDb Trivia for Cheers]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Guest stars===
Although ''Cheers'' operated largely around that main ensemble cast, [[guest star]]s did occasionally supplement them. Notable repeat guests included [[Jay Thomas]] as [[Eddie LeBec]], [[Dan Hedaya]] as [[Nick Tortelli]], [[Jean Kasem]] as [[Loretta Tortelli]], [[Roger Rees]] as [[Robin Colcord]], [[Tom Skerritt]] as [[Evan Drake]], and [[Harry Anderson]] as Harry 'The Hat' Gittes. Other celebrities guest-starred in single episodes as themselves throughout the series. Some sports figures appeared on the show with a connection to Boston or Sam's former team, the Red Sox, such as [[Luis Tiant]], [[Wade Boggs]], and [[Kevin McHale]] (star player of the [[Boston Celtics]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;nba&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nba.com/history/players/mchale_bio.html |title=Kevin McHale Bio |accessdate=2009-12-20 |work=NBA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some television stars also made guest appearances as themselves such as [[Alex Trebek]], [[Arsenio Hall]], [[Dick Cavett]], [[Robert Urich]], and [[Johnny Carson]]. Various political figures even made appearances on ''Cheers'' such as then-[[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]] [[Admiral (United States)|Admiral]] [[William J. Crowe]], former [[Colorado]] [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Gary Hart]], then-[[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] [[Tip O'Neill]], Senator [[John Kerry]], then-[[Governor of Massachusetts|Governor]] [[Michael Dukakis]], and then-[[Mayor of Boston]] [[Raymond Flynn]], the last four of whom all represented Cheers' home state and city. [[Michael richards|Michael Richards]] portrays one of Sam's old drinking buddies, Eddie Gordon, who attempts to gain ownership of Cheers in the episode &quot;Bar Bet&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0539695/&lt;/ref&gt;

Musician [[Harry Connick, Jr.]] appeared in an episode as Woody's cousin&lt;ref&gt;IMDb (2006) (April 10, 2006). [http://imdb.com/title/tt0083399/epcast Full Episode Casts]&lt;/ref&gt; and plays a song from his Grammy winning album ''[[We Are in Love]]'' (c. 1991).
[[John Cleese]] won an Emmy for his guest appearance as &quot;Dr. Simon Finch-Royce&quot; in the fifth season episode, &quot;Simon Says&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;awards1&quot;&gt;IMDb (2006). [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083399/awards Awards for ''Cheers'']&lt;/ref&gt; [[Emma Thompson]] guest starred as [[Nannette Guzman|Nanny G/Nannette Guzman]], a famous singing nanny and Frasier's ex-wife. [[Glynis Johns]] played Diane's mother in one episode. [[Christopher Lloyd]] guest starred as a tortured artist who wanted to paint Diane. [[John Mahoney]] once appeared as an inept jingle writer, which included a brief conversation with Frasier Crane, whose father he later portrayed on the spin-off ''Frasier''. [[Peri Gilpin]] who later played [[Roz Doyle]] on Frasier also appeared in one episode of Cheers, in its 11th season, as Holly Matheson, a reporter who interviews Woody. [[The Righteous Brothers]], [[Bobby Hatfield]] and [[Bill Medley]], also guest starred in different episodes, and [[Kate Mulgrew]] appeared in the 3-episode finale of season four. In the final episode of Kirstie Alley's run as Rebecca, she was wooed away from Cheers by the guy who came to fix one of the beer keg taps&amp;nbsp;– surprising for a &quot;high-class&quot; lady&amp;nbsp;– who happened to be [[Tom Berenger]]. [[Leah Remini]] played one of Carla's daughters; Serafina Tortelli.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0539796/ &quot;Loathe and Marriage&quot; IMDB episode entry]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recurring characters===
{{Main|List of recurring Cheers characters}}

[[Paul Willson]], who played the recurring barfly character of &quot;Paul&quot;, made early appearances in the first season as &quot;Glen&quot;, was credited as &quot;Gregg&quot;, and also appeared in the show as a character named &quot;Tom&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;IMDb (2006). [http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0932750/bio Trivia for Paul Willson]&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas Babson played &quot;Tom&quot;, a law student often mocked by [[Cliff Clavin]], for continually failing to pass the Massachusetts bar exam. &quot;Al&quot;, played by [[Al Rosen (actor)|Al Rosen]], appeared in 38 episodes, and was known for his surly quips. Rhea Perlman's father Philip Perlman played the role of &quot;Phil&quot;.

==Production==
===Creation===
The concept for ''Cheers'' was the end result of a long process. The original idea was a group of workers who interacted like a family, the goal being a similar concept to ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]''. The creators considered making an American version of the [[United Kingdom|British]] ''[[Fawlty Towers]]'' centered on a hotel or an inn. When the creators settled on a bar as their setting, the show began to resemble the [[Radio programming|radio show]] ''[[Duffy's Tavern]]''. They liked the idea of a tavern, as it provided a continuous stream of new people arriving, giving them a constant supply of characters.&lt;ref name=&quot;toastingcheers&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Cheers Street Boston 2005.jpg|thumb|upright|Picture of [[Bull &amp; Finch Pub]] in Boston in 2005. This view is similar to the opening credits of the show.]]
After choosing a setting, the creators needed to choose a location. Early discussions centered on [[Barstow, California]], then [[Kansas City, Missouri]]. They eventually turned to the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] and finally Boston. The [[Bull &amp; Finch Pub]] in Boston that Cheers was styled after was originally chosen from a [[Telephone directory|phone book]]. When Glen Charles asked the owner to shoot initial [[Establishing shot|exterior]] and interior shots the owner agreed, charging [[United States dollar|$]]1. He has since gone on to make millions, licensing the pub's image and selling a variety of ''Cheers'' memorabilia, making the Bull &amp; Finch the 42nd busiest outlet in the American food and beverage industry in 1997.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} During initial casting, Shelley Long, who was in Boston at the time filming ''[[A Small Circle of Friends]]'', remarked that the bar in the script resembled a bar she had come upon in the city, which turned out to be the Bull &amp; Finch.&lt;ref name=&quot;toastingcheers&quot;/&gt;
The theme song ([[Where Everybody Knows Your Name]]) started on the corner, with cars going past then back in time to horse and carts. A piano was used at the start and then drums were introduced as pictures of customers from 1880s were shown with cast. One of the cast would then say &quot;Cheers is filmed before a live studio audience&quot;.

===Filming===
Most ''Cheers'' episodes were shot before a live studio audience on Paramount Stage 25 in [[Hollywood, California]], generally on Tuesday nights. Scripts for a new episode were issued the Wednesday before for a [[read-through]], Friday was [[rehearsal]] day, and final scripts were issued on Monday. Nearly 100 crew members were involved in the shooting of any given episode. Burrows, who directed most episodes, insisted using [[film stock]] rather than [[videotape]]. He was also noted for utilizing motion in his directorial style, trying to constantly keep characters moving rather than standing still.&lt;ref name=&quot;toastingcheers&quot;/&gt;

Due to a decision by Glen and Les Charles, each [[cold open]] was not connected to the rest of the episode, with the lowest-ranked writers assigned to create the jokes for them. Some cold opens were taken from episodes that ran too long.&lt;ref name=levine20110128&gt;{{cite news|last=Levine|first=Ken|title=My favorite CHEERS teaser|url=http://kenlevine.blogspot.com/2011/01/my-favorite-cheers-teaser.html|accessdate=2011-01-28|newspaper=kenlevine.blogspot.com|date=2011-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first year of the show took place entirely within the confines of the bar, the first location outside the bar being Diane's apartment. When the series became a hit, the characters started venturing further afield, first to other sets and eventually to an occasional exterior location. The exterior location shots of the bar were of the [[Bull &amp; Finch Pub]], located directly north of the [[Public Garden (Boston)|Boston Public Garden]], which has become a [[tourist attraction]] because of its association with the series, and draws in nearly one million visitors annually.&lt;ref name=&quot;toastingcheers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;synd1&quot;/&gt; It has since been renamed Cheers Beacon Hill,&lt;ref&gt;Cheers Boston (2006). [http://www.cheersboston.com/index_bh.htm Cheers Beacon Hill]&lt;/ref&gt; though its interior is different from the TV bar.

To further capitalize on the show's popularity, another bar, Cheers Faneuil Hall,&lt;ref&gt;Cheers Boston (2006). [http://www.cheersboston.com/index_fh.htm Cheers Faneuil Hall]&lt;/ref&gt; was built to be a replica of the show's set to provide tourists with a bar whose interior was closer to the one they saw on TV. It is near [[Faneuil Hall]], about a mile from the Bull &amp; Finch Pub. In 1997 Europe's first officially licensed Cheers bar opened in London's Regent's Street W1.&lt;ref&gt;Cheers London (2003). [http://www.cheersbarlondon.com/ Cheers London]&lt;/ref&gt; Like Cheers Faneuil Hall, Cheers London is a replica of the set. The gala opening was attended by James Burrows and cast members George Wendt and John Ratzenberger.&lt;ref&gt;''USA Today'' (September 23, 1997).&lt;/ref&gt; The actual bar set had been on display at the Hollywood Entertainment Museum until the museum’s closing in early 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Hollywood Entertainment Museum (2006). [http://www.seeing-stars.com/Museums/HollywoodEntertainment.shtml Hollywood Entertainment Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crew===
{{Expand section|date=March 2011}}

The crew of ''Cheers'' numbered in the hundreds. The three creators, [[James Burrows]], [[Glen Charles]], and [[Les Charles]].&lt;ref&gt;IMDb (2006). [http://imdb.com/title/tt0083399/fullcredits Full Cast and Crew].&lt;/ref&gt; kept offices on Paramount's lot for the duration of the ''Cheers'' run. In the final seasons, however, they handed over much of the show to Burrows. Burrows is regarded as being a factor in the show's longevity, directing 243 of the episodes and supervising the show's production.&lt;ref name=&quot;toastingcheers&quot;/&gt; [[David Angell]] was also a part of the crew from the start, writing many ''Cheers'' episodes. The show was often noted for its writing,&lt;ref name=&quot;toastingcheers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;chardevelop&quot;&gt;The Museum of Broadcast Communications (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; which most credit, along with the ensemble cast and other production factors, for the show's success.

==Awards==
Over its 11-season run, the ''Cheers'' cast and crew earned many awards. The show garnered a record 111 [[Emmy Award]] nominations, with a total of 26 wins.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; In addition, ''Cheers'' earned 31 [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globe]] nominations, with a total of six wins. Danson, Long, Alley, Perlman, Wendt, Ratzenberger, Harrelson, Grammer, Neuwirth, and Colosanto all received Emmy nominations for their roles. ''Cheers'' won the Golden Globe for &quot;Best TV-Series&amp;nbsp;– Comedy/Musical&quot; in 1991 and the Emmy for &quot;Outstanding Comedy Series&quot; in 1983, 1984, 1989, and 1991. The series was presented with the &quot;Legend Award&quot; at the 2006 [[TV Land Award]]s, with many of the surviving cast members attending the event.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sitcomsonline.com/blog/2006/02/tv-land-honors-cheers-dallas-good.html &quot;TV Land Honors Cheers, Dallas, Good Times, and Batman&quot;] for SitcomsOnline on February 22, 2006.

==Plot==
{{Citations missing|date=September 2010}}
{{Original research|date=September 2010}}
{{Main|List of Cheers episodes}}
Nearly all of ''Cheers'' took place in the front room of the bar, but they often went into the rear pool room or the bar's office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Why `Cheers` Looks Sharp Each Week |date=|work= Chicago Tribune|url= http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1986-03-30/entertainment/8601230357_1_ted-danson-kiss-les-and-glen-charles|accessdate=2010-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Cheers'' did not show any action [[Cheers#Outside the bar|outside the bar]] until the first episode of the second season, which took place in Diane's apartment.

''Cheers'' had several [[running gag]]s, such as Norm arriving in the bar greeted by a loud &quot;Norm!&quot; Early episodes generally followed Sam's antics with his various women, following a variety of [[Romantic comedy film|romantic comedy]] [[cliché]]s to get out of whatever relationship troubles he was in during each episode. As the show progressed and Sam got into more serious relationships, the general tone switched to a comedic take on Sam settling into a [[Monogamy|monogamous]] lifestyle. Throughout the series, larger [[story arc]]s began to develop that spanned multiple episodes or seasons, interspersed with smaller themes and one-off episodes.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

===Romance===
[[File:Cheers sam diane kiss.jpg|thumb|Sam and Diane kiss]]
The show's main theme in its early seasons was the romance between the intellectual waitress Diane Chambers and bar owner Sam Malone, a former major league [[Pitcher|baseball pitcher]] for the Boston Red Sox and a recovering [[alcoholic]].&lt;ref&gt;Television Heaven (2002)(2006). [http://www.televisionheaven.co.uk/cheers.htm ''Cheers''&amp;nbsp;– A Television Heaven Review]&lt;/ref&gt; After Shelly Long (Diane) left the show, the focus shifted to Sam's new relationship with neurotic corporate ladder climber Rebecca. Both relationships featured [[sexual tension]] that spanned many episodes, which drew viewers to tune in during following weeks to see the results.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

===Social issues===
Many ''Cheers'' scripts centered or touched upon a variety of social issues, albeit humorously. As ''Toasting Cheers'' puts it, &quot;The script was further strengthened by the writers' boldness in successfully tackling controversial issues such as alcoholism, homosexuality, and adultery.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;toastingcheers&quot;/&gt;

[[Social class]] was a subtext of the show. The &quot;upper class&quot;—represented by characters like Diane Chambers, [[Frasier Crane]], [[Lilith Sternin]] and (initially) Rebecca Howe—rubbed shoulders with middle and working class characters&amp;nbsp;— Sam Malone, Carla Tortelli, Norm Peterson and Cliff Clavin. An extreme example of this was the relationship between Woody Boyd and a [[millionaire]]'s daughter [[Kelly Gaines]]. Many viewers enjoyed ''Cheers'' in part because of this focus on character development in addition to plot development.&lt;ref name=&quot;toastingcheers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;chardevelop&quot;/&gt;

[[Feminism]] and the role of women were also recurring themes throughout the show, with some seeing each of the major female characters as a flawed feminist in her own way.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Caren Deming. &quot;Talk: Gender Discourse in ''Cheers''!&quot; in ''Television Criticism: Approaches and Applications'' edited by Leah R. Vande Berg and Lawrence A Wenner. White Plains, NY: Longman, 1991. 47–57. The essay is co-authored by Mercilee M. Jenkins, who teaches at San Francisco State University.&lt;/ref&gt; Diane was a vocal feminist, and Sam was the epitome of everything she hated: a [[Promiscuity|womanizer]] and a [[Chauvinism|male chauvinist]]. Their relationship led Diane to several diatribes on Sam's promiscuity.&lt;ref name=&quot;toastingcheers&quot;/&gt; Carla insulted people, but was respected because of her tough attitude, wit, and power, while Diane was often ignored as she commanded little respect in any successful way. Rebecca was a stereotypical ambitious businesswoman and [[courtesan|gold-digger]], seeking relationships with her superiors at the Lillian Corporation, most notably [[Evan Drake]], to gain promotions or raises. She encountered a [[glass ceiling]], however, and ended the show by marrying a plumber rather than a rich businessman. It was later revealed on ''Frasier'' that her husband struck it rich and left her, after which Rebecca returned to Cheers as a patron. Lilith was a high profile psychiatrist with many degrees and awards, and commanded respect with her strong and rather stern demeanor. Like Rebecca, she was an executive woman of the 1980s who put much emphasis on her professional life. She was often shown to have the upper hand in her and Frasier's relationship, and was portrayed as an ice queen, but proved to have a fiery [[libido]] and a maternal nature.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

[[Homosexuality]] was dealt with from the very first season, a rare move for American network television in the early 1980s.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} In the first season episode &quot;The Boys In The Bar&quot; (after the 1970s film ''[[The Boys in the Band]]'') a friend and former teammate of Sam's [[Coming out|comes out]] in his [[autobiography]]. Some of the male regulars pressure Sam to take action to ensure that Cheers does not become a [[gay bar]]. The episode won a [[Gay &amp; Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation|GLAAD]] [[GLAAD Media Awards|Media Award]],&lt;ref name=&quot;trivia&quot;/&gt; and the script's writers, [[Ken Levine (TV personality)|Ken Levine]] and David Isaacs, were nominated for an Emmy Award for their writing.&lt;ref name=&quot;awards1&quot;/&gt; [[Harvey Fierstein]] later appeared in the 1990s as &quot;Mark Newberger&quot;, Rebecca's old high school sweetheart who is gay. Finally, the final episode included a gay man who gets into trouble with his boyfriend, played by [[Anthony Heald]], after agreeing to pose as Diane's husband.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

[[Substance use disorder|Addiction]] also plays a role in ''Cheers'', almost exclusively through Sam, although some critics believed the issue was never really developed.&lt;ref&gt;The Bemusement Park (May 7, 2004) (2006). [http://web.archive.org/web/20061101100759/http://markhasty.com/archives/2004/05/07/the-situation-of-comedy/ The Situation of Comedy]&lt;/ref&gt; Sam was a recovering [[alcoholism|alcoholic]] who ended up buying a bar during his bout with alcoholism. After he achieved sobriety, he decided to continue to own and operate the bar for &quot;sentimental reasons.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083399/plotsummary IMDb Plot Summary of Cheers]&lt;/ref&gt; Frasier also has a notable bout of drinking in the fourth season episode &quot;The Triangle&quot;, while Woody develops a [[problem gambling|gambling]] problem in the seventh season's &quot;Call Me Irresponsible&quot;. Some critics believe Sam was a generally [[Behavioral addiction|addictive personality]] who had largely conquered his alcoholism but was still a [[Sexual addiction|sexual addict]], shown through his womanizing, for which he eventually got help. Norm's alcoholism (his bar tab was said to be compiled by [[NASA]]) was never a main focus of the show.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

===''Cheers'' owners===
[[File:Cheers Boston 2005.jpg|thumb|The ''Cheers'' sign in 2005.]]
Cheers obviously had several owners before Sam, as the bar was opened in 1889. The &quot;Est. 1895&quot; on the bar's sign is a made-up date chosen by Carla for [[numerology|numerological]] purposes, revealed in the 8th season episode &quot;The Stork Brings a Crane&quot;. In the second episode, &quot;Sam's Women&quot;, Coach tells a customer looking for Gus, the owner of Cheers, that Gus was dead and Sam now owned the bar. In a later episode, Gus O'Mally, however, comes back from Arizona for one night and helps run the bar.

The biggest storyline surrounding the ownership of Cheers begins in the fifth season finale, &quot;I Do, Adieu&quot;, when Sam and Diane part ways, due to Shelley Long leaving the regular cast. In addition, Sam leaves in an attempt to [[Circumnavigation|circumnavigate]] the Earth. Before he leaves, however, Sam sells Cheers to the Lillian Corporation. He then returns in the sixth season premiere, &quot;Home is the Sailor&quot;, having sunk his boat, to find the bar under the new management of Rebecca Howe. He begs for his job back and is hired by Rebecca as a bartender. In the seventh season premiere, &quot;How to Recede in Business&quot;, Rebecca is fired and Sam is promoted to manager. Rebecca is allowed to keep a job at Lillian vaguely similar to what she had before, but only after Sam had Rebecca ([[in absentia]]) &quot;agree&quot; to a long list of demands that the corporation had for her.

From there Sam occasionally attempted to buy the bar back with schemes that usually involved wealthy executive [[Robin Colcord]]. Cheers did eventually end up back in Sam's hands in the eighth season finale, when it was sold back to him for eighty-five [[Penny (United States coin)|cents]] by the Lillian Corporation after he alerted the company to Colcord's [[insider trading]]. Fired by the corporation because of her silence on the issue, Rebecca earns back a hostess/office manager job from Sam.

===Other recurring themes===
In addition to extended story lines, ''Cheers'' had recurring themes. There was a heated rivalry between Cheers and a rival bar, Gary's Olde Towne Tavern, starting with the fourth season episode &quot;From Beer to Eternity&quot;. Beginning in the sixth season, one episode of each season depicted some wager between Sam and Gary, which resulted in either a sports competition or a battle of wits that devolved into complex practical jokes. Aside from the very first and very last &quot;Bar Wars&quot; episodes, the Cheers gang almost always lost to Gary's superior ingenuity, though they managed to trick him into missing the annual Bloody Mary contest in one episode. One episode had Sam collaborating with Gary's to get revenge on his co-workers on a prior practical joke. Another episode involved a pickup basketball game, in which Gary tricked the people of Cheers that a minor injury sustained by basketball great [[Kevin McHale]] was actually a season-ending injury.

Sam also had a long-running feud with the upscale restaurant above the bar, Melville's Fine Sea Food. The restaurant's management disliked the bar's patrons, while Sam regarded the restaurant as snobbish (though customers often moved between the two businesses via a prominent staircase). This conflict escalated after Melville's came under the ownership of John Allen Hill ([[Keene Curtis]]), as Sam did not technically own the bar's poolroom and bathrooms. Sam was subsequently forced to pay rent for them and often found himself at the mercy of Hill's tyranny. Rebecca eventually helped Sam buy the back section from Hill.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Crash of the Titans|episodelink=List of Cheers episodes#ep213|series=Cheers|network=NBC|airdate=February 21, 1991|season=9|number=19|minutes=21:44
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another recurring theme, Norm Peterson continually searched for gainful employment as an accountant, but spent most of the series unemployed, thereby explaining his constant presence in Cheers at the same stool, though he was not above leaving work early when he ''was'' employed. The face of his wife, Vera, was [[Unseen character|never fully seen onscreen]], despite a few fleeting appearances and vocal cameos. She first appeared briefly in the fifth season episode &quot;Thanksgiving Orphans&quot; with her face covered in pumpkin-pie filling, portrayed by Bernadette Birkett, the wife of George Wendt.

Cliff Clavin seemed unable to shake the constant presence of his mother, [[List of recurring Cheers characters#Esther Clavin|Esther Clavin]] ([[Frances Sternhagen]]). He often referred to her, usually as an emotional burden and/or a smothering parent. Her first onscreen appearance was in the fifth season.

Finally, Carla Tortelli carried a reputation of being both highly fertile and matrimonially inept. Her last husband, [[Eddie LeBec]], was a washed-up [[ice hockey]] [[goaltender]] who eventually died in an ice show accident involving a [[Ice resurfacer|zamboni]], an apparent ''homage'' to [[Chuckles the clown]] being &quot;unshelled by a rogue elephant&quot; in a ''Mary Tyler Moore'' episode written by [[David Lloyd (writer)|David Lloyd]]. Carla later discovered that Eddie had cheated on her, marrying another woman after impregnating her. Carla's sleazy first husband, [[Nick Tortelli]] ([[Dan Hedaya]]), also made appearances, mostly to torment Carla with a new custody battle or legal scam that grew out of their divorce. Carla's eight children, four of whom were &quot;born&quot; during the show's run, were notoriously ill-behaved, except for Lud, who was sired by a prominent academician.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} (This was shown on the show.)

==Critical reactions==
''Cheers'' was critically acclaimed in its first season, though it landed a disappointing 74th out of 74 shows in that year's ratings.&lt;ref&gt;TVParty (2006). [http://www.tvparty.com/80nbc3.html How NBC got its Groove back]&lt;/ref&gt; This critical support, coupled with early success at the Emmys and the support of the president of NBC's entertainment division [[Brandon Tartikoff]], is thought to be the main reason for the show's survival and eventual success.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;BBC (July 4, 2003) (2006). [http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A1084619 ''Cheers''&amp;nbsp;– the TV Series]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Variety (May 20, 2003) (2006). [http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117921154?categoryid=1023&amp;cs=1 Review&amp;nbsp;– ''Cheers'']&lt;/ref&gt; The cast themselves went across the country on various [[talk show]]s to try to further promote the series after its first season. With the growing popularity of ''[[Family Ties]]'', which ran in the slot ahead of ''Cheers'' from January 1984 until ''Family Ties'' was moved to Sundays in 1987, and the placement of ''[[The Cosby Show]]'' in front of both at the start of their third season (1984), the line-up became a runaway ratings success that NBC eventually dubbed &quot;[[Must See TV|Must See Thursday]]&quot;. The next season, ''Cheers'' ratings increased dramatically after Woody Boyd became a regular character as well. By the end of its final season, ''Cheers'' had a run of eight consecutive seasons in the Top Ten of the [[Nielsen ratings]];&lt;ref name=&quot;toastingcheers&quot;/&gt; seven of them were in the Top Five. Some critics {{who|date=December 2010}} now use ''Frasier'' and ''Cheers'' as a model of a successful spin-off for a character from an already successful series to compare to modern spin-offs.

Cheers began with a limited five-character ensemble consisting of Ted Danson, Shelley Long, Rhea Perlman, Nicholas Colasanto and George Wendt. By the time season 10 began, Cheers held 8 front characters in its roster. Cheers was also able to gradually phase in characters such as Cliff, Frasier, Lilith, Rebecca, and Woody. During season 1, only one set, the bar, housed all of the episodes. Later seasons introduced other sets, but the show's ability to center the action in the bar and avoid straying was notable.

NBC dedicated a whole night to the final episode of ''Cheers,'' following the one-hour season finale of Seinfeld (which was its lead-in). The show began with a &quot;pregame&quot; show hosted by [[Bob Costas]], followed by the final 98-minute episode itself. NBC affiliates then aired tributes to ''Cheers'' during their local newscasts, and the night concluded with a special ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno (1992 TV series)|Tonight Show]]'' broadcast live from the Bull &amp; Finch Pub. Although the episode fell short of its hyped ratings predictions to become the [[List of most-watched television broadcasts|most-watched television episode]], it was the most watched show that year, bringing in 80.4 million viewers&lt;ref name=&quot;aol&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://television.aol.com/feature/may-sweeps/photos-quizzes/most-watched-finales|title=May Sweeps: Season Finales and TV Specials|accessdate=2009-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; (64 percent of all viewers that night), and ranked 11th all time in entertainment programming.

The episode originally aired in the usual ''Cheers'' spot of Thursday night, and was then rebroadcast on Sunday. Some estimate that while the original broadcast did not outperform the [[Goodbye, Farewell and Amen|''M*A*S*H'' finale]], the combined non-repeating audiences for the Thursday and Sunday showings did. {{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} ''Toasting Cheers'' also notes that television had greatly changed between the ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'' and ''Cheers'' finales, leaving ''Cheers'' with a broader array of competition for ratings.&lt;ref name=&quot;toastingcheers&quot;/&gt;

==Spin-offs, crossovers and cultural references==
{{Ref improve section|date=May 2010}}
Some of the actors and actresses from ''Cheers'' brought their characters into other television shows, either in a guest appearance or in a new [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] series. The most successful ''Cheers'' spin-off was the show ''[[Frasier]]'', which directly followed Frasier Crane after he moved back to [[Seattle]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] to live with his recently disabled father and to host a call-in radio show. Frasier was originally supposed to be a small disliked character who only existed to further Diane and Sam's relationship, but Kelsey Grammer's acting turned what were supposed to be drab lines into comedy the audience enjoyed.&lt;ref&gt;Poobala (2006). [http://www.poobala.com/cheersandfrasier.html Notes on ''Cheers'' / ''Frasier'' crossovers]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sam, Diane, and Woody all had individual crossover appearances on ''Frasier'' where they came to visit Frasier, and his ex-wife [[Lilith Sternin|Lilith]] was a constant supporting character throughout the show. Cliff, Norm, Carla, and two of Cheers' regular background barflies Paul and Phil, had a crossover together in the [[List of Frasier episodes|''Frasier'' episode]] &quot;[[Cheerful Goodbyes]]&quot;. In that episode, Frasier, on a trip to Boston, meets the Cheers gang (though not at Cheers itself) and Cliff thinks Frasier has flown out specifically for his (Cliff's) retirement party, which Frasier ends up attending.

''Frasier'' was on the air for as many seasons and almost as many episodes as ''Cheers'', going off the air in 2004 after an 11-season run. Although ''Frasier'' was the most successful spin-off, ''[[The Tortellis]]'' was the first series to spin off from ''Cheers'', premiering in 1987. The show featured Carla's ex-husband [[Nick Tortelli]] and his wife [[Loretta Tortelli|Loretta]], but was canceled after 13 episodes and drew protests for its stereotypical depictions of Italian-Americans.

In addition to direct spin-offs, several ''Cheers'' characters had guest appearance crossovers with other shows.
[[File:Cheers on the simpsons.jpg|thumb|Woody, Cliff and Norm on ''The Simpsons'']]
* In ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode &quot;[[Fear of Flying (The Simpsons)|Fear of Flying]]&quot;, [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] stumbles into a Cheers-like bar after being kicked out of [[Moe Szyslak|Moe's]]. Most of the ''Cheers'' central cast appears in the episode, including Frasier, though Frasier does not speak, as Kelsey Grammer already had a recurring role on ''The Simpsons'' as [[Sideshow Bob]]. The tag line for Moe's Tavern, &quot;Where nobody knows your name&quot;, is also a reference to the theme song of ''Cheers''.
* Characters also had crossovers with ''[[Wings (NBC TV series)|Wings]]'' — which was created by the ''Cheers'' producer–writers — and ''[[St. Elsewhere]]'' in a somewhat rare comedy–drama crossover.&lt;ref&gt;Poobala (2006). [http://www.poobala.com/cheersandelsewhere.html Notes on ''Cheers'' / ''St. Elsewhere'' crossover]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Norm once appeared as a background character buying beer at the counter of a convenience store in the ''[[Futurama]]'' episode &quot;[[The Route of All Evil]]&quot;. His only line is a direct quote from ''Cheers'', when he's asked by the clerk &quot;Would you like anything else, Sir?&quot; and responds &quot;A reason to live. Give me another beer.&quot;
* The ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' character [[List of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine characters#Morn|Morn]], who remained mostly at [[Quark (Star Trek)|Quark's Bar]], is named, as an [[anagram]], for Norm Peterson.&lt;ref&gt;TV Acres (January 24, ????) (2006). [http://www.tvacres.com/greetings_norm.htm Nor-r-rm!]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The bar and its patrons were also featured in two Disney specials, a scene in ''[[Walt Disney anthology television series|The Wonderful World of Disney]]'' TV special ''[[Mickey's 60th Birthday]]'', and ''[[The Magical World of Disney]]'' 's Disneyland 35th Anniversary Special, in which Woody recounts an adventure he had on the [[Haunted Mansion]] as a young person.
* The [[Title sequence|opening sequence]] and theme song has become iconic of the series, leading to [[parody|parodies]] such as ''The Simpsons''' episode &quot;[[Flaming Moe's]]&quot;.  ''The Simpsons'' series has also used the ''Cheers'' opening sequence in the couch gag of the 11th episode of the 20th season. In the couch gag, Kelsey Grammer's ''Simpsons'' character [[Sideshow Bob]] walks in the Cheers door wearing a suit akin to an outfit Frasier would wear.
* The ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]]'' [[List of Scrubs episodes|episode]] &quot;[[My Life in Four Cameras]]&quot; makes numerous jokes about ''Cheers'' and [[multiple-camera setup]] [[laugh track]] sitcoms. ''Scrubs'' is notable for using a [[single-camera setup]], having no laugh track, and not being filmed before a live audience. ''Cheers'' had all four cameras, a laugh track, and was filmed before a live studio audience, and a dream sequence in &quot;My Life in Four Cameras&quot; was shot with three cameras. In addition, the main patient treated was fictional ''Cheers'' writer &quot;Charles James&quot;, a mixture of ''Cheers'' creators James Burrows, Glen Charles, and Les Charles. The episode makes repeated comments about these &quot;traditional&quot; sitcoms and ends with the opening notes of the ''Cheers'' theme playing while [[John Dorian|J.D.]] says &quot;Unfortunately, around here things don't always end as neat and tidy as they do in sitcoms.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;(March 10, 2005) (2006) Chicago Tribune. [http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/entertainment_tv/2005/03/cheers_to_scrub.html Cheers to &quot;Scrubs&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the ''[[Seinfeld]]'' episode &quot;The Ticket&quot;, Ted Danson's salary per episode of ''Cheers'' comes up as a point of debate between Jerry and George. Additionally, George Wendt appears as himself on a talk show in the episode &quot;[[The Trip (Seinfeld)|The Trip]]&quot;. George Costanza gives him advice on how to improve ''Cheers'' by saying they should change from the bar setting, but George Wendt makes fun of him for it on the air.
* In the ''[[Friends]]'' episode &quot;The One with Ross's Wedding&quot; — set in [[London]], rather than the show's usual setting of [[New York City]] — Joey watches the ''Cheers'' opening sequence and gets homesick. Later, he makes a best man speech mentioning the ''Cheers'' chorus.
* At the close of the ''[[How I Met Your Mother]]'' episode &quot;Swarley&quot;, all of the customers in the show's bar call out &quot;Swarley&quot;, a nickname for [[Neil Patrick Harris]]'s character [[Barney Stinson]], as he enters. The bartender then plays the ''Cheers'' theme song and the credits run in the ''Cheers'' typeface and color.
* In the video game ''[[Tony Hawk's Underground 2]]'', when you start the game in Boston, there is a bar called &quot;Jeers&quot; that is modeled after the &quot;Cheers&quot; bar, both inside and out. This is where you must find the special guest in the game, who is [[Jesse James]].
* In the third season episode of ''[[The Office (U.S. TV series)|The Office]]'' &quot;Diwali&quot;, Andy Bernard refers to his relationship with Karen Filipelli as &quot;Roller coastery friendship.

==Licensing==
{{Original research|section|date=December 2010}}
The series lent itself naturally to the development of &quot;Cheers&quot; bar-related merchandise, culminating in the development of a chain of &quot;Cheers&quot; themed pubs. Paramount's licensing group, led by [[Tom McGrath]], developed the &quot;Cheers&quot; pub concept initially in partnership with Host Marriott, which placed &quot;Cheers&quot; themed pubs in over 24 airports around the world. Boston boasts the original Cheers bar, historically known to Boston insiders as the ''Bull and Finch'', as well as a Cheers restaurant in the Faneuil Hall marketplace, and ''Sam's Place'', a spin-off sports bar concept also located at Faneuil Hall. The theme song to the show was eventually licensed to a Canadian restaurant, [[Kelsey's Neighbourhood Bar &amp; Grill]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://biz.yahoo.com/cnw/080203/kelsey_s_ad_campaign.html?.v=1 Kelsey's Launches Ad Campaign with Cheers TV Theme Song: Financial News&amp;nbsp;– Yahoo!

==Syndication and home video==
''Cheers'' grew in popularity as it aired on American television and entered into syndication. When the show went off the air in 1993, ''Cheers'' was syndicated in 38 countries with 179 American television markets and 83 million viewers.&lt;ref name=&quot;toastingcheers&quot;/&gt; After going off the air,&lt;ref name=&quot;synd1&quot;&gt;International Real Estate Digest (August 20, 2001) (2006). [http://www.ired.com/news/2001/0108/cheers.htm Boston Gets a Hollywood ''Cheers'' Pub]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Cheers'' entered a long and successful continuing syndication run&lt;ref name=&quot;chardevelop&quot;/&gt; on ''[[Nick at Nite]]'', later moving to [[TV Land]] in 2004. TV Land has since stopped airing reruns.

''Cheers'' reruns were a programming staple on Boston's own [[WSBK-TV]] for many years. Paramount (as a subsidiary of [[Viacom]]) would later buy the station in 1995; it is now owned by [[CBS Television Stations]].

The series began airing on [[Hallmark Channel]] in the [[United States]] in 2008, and [[WGN America]] in 2009, where it continues to air on both channels. In January 2011, [[Reelz Channel]] began airing the series in hour blocks. When the quality of some earlier footage of ''Cheers'' began to deteriorate, it underwent a careful restoration in 2001 due to its continued success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kodak.com/US/en/motion/newsletters/inCamera/oct2001/cheers.shtml|title=''Cheers'' restored for a new generation of laughs|accessdate=2006-00-00}}{{Dead link|url=http://www.kodak.com/US/en/motion/newsletters/inCamera/oct2001/cheers.shtml|date=September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of April 1, 2011, [[Netflix]] began including Cheers as one of the titles on its &quot;watch instantly&quot; streaming service

A ''Cheers'' rerun replaced ''[[Australia's Naughtiest Home Videos]]'' on Australia's [[Nine Network]]. The latter was canceled mid-episode on its only broadcast by [[Kerry Packer]], who pulled the plug after a phone call. It was repeated on [[Eleven (TV channel)|Eleven]]. ''Cheers'' was aired by [[Nederlandse Christelijke Radio Vereniging|NCRV]] in the [[Netherlands]]. After the last episode, NCRV simply began re-airing the series, and then again, thus airing the show three times in a row, showing an episode nightly.

===High definition===
A high-definition transfer of &quot;Cheers&quot; began running on [[HDNet]] in the United States in August 2010. Originally shot on film, but broadcast in a 4:3 aspect ratio, the newly transferred versions are in 16:9.

===DVD releases===
[[Paramount Home Entertainment]] and [[CBS Home Entertainment|CBS DVD]] have released all 11 seasons of ''Cheers'' on DVD in Region 1 and Region 4.

In Region 2 the first 7 seasons have been released on DVD.

[[Image:BachFugueBar.png|thumb|Extract from “[[Fugue]] No.17 in A{{music|flat}}” ([[BWV]]862), from ''[[Well-tempered Clavier|Das wohltemperierte Klavier]]'' by [[J. S. Bach|Bach]], who is widely regarded as the greatest practitioner of counterpoint.]] 
In [[music]], '''counterpoint''' is the relationship between two or more [[Register (music)|voices]] that are independent in contour and [[rhythm]] and are [[harmony|harmonically]] interdependent ([[polyphony]]). It has been most commonly identified in [[classical music]], developing strongly during the [[renaissance music|Renaissance]] and in much of the [[common practice period]], especially in [[Baroque music]]. The term originates from the [[Latin]] ''punctus contra punctum'' meaning &quot;point against point&quot;.

==General principles==
In its most general aspect, counterpoint involves the writing of musical lines that sound very different and move independently from each other but sound harmonious when played simultaneously. In each era, [[Contrapuntal motion|contrapuntally]] organized music writing has been subject to rules, sometimes strict. By definition, [[Chord (music)|chords]] occur when multiple notes sound simultaneously; however, harmonic, &quot;[[vertical (music)|vertical]]&quot; features are considered secondary and almost incidental when counterpoint is the predominant textural element. Counterpoint focuses on melodic interaction&amp;mdash;only secondarily on the harmonies produced by that interaction. In the words of John Rahn:

{{quote|It is hard to write a beautiful song. It is harder to write several individually beautiful songs that, when sung simultaneously, sound as a more beautiful polyphonic whole. The internal structures that create each of the voices separately must contribute to the emergent structure of the polyphony, which in turn must reinforce and comment on the structures of the individual voices. The way that is accomplished in detail is...'counterpoint'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rahn |first=John |others=intro. and comment. by [[Benjamin Boretz]] |title=Music Inside Out: Going Too Far in Musical Essays |year=2000 |publisher=G+B Arts International |location=Amsterdam |isbn=90-5701-332-0 |oclc=154331400 |ref=Rahn |page=177}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The separation of harmony and counterpoint is not absolute. It is impossible to write simultaneous lines without producing harmony, and impossible to write harmony without linear activity. The composer who chooses to ignore one aspect in favour of the other still must face the fact that the listener cannot simply turn off harmonic or linear hearing at will; thus the composer risks creating annoying distractions unintentionally. [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]]'s counterpoint—often considered the most profound synthesis of the two dimensions ever achieved—is extremely rich harmonically and always clearly directed tonally, while the individual lines remain fascinating.

==Development==
Counterpoint was elaborated extensively in the [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] period, but composers of the [[Baroque music|Baroque]] period brought counterpoint to a culmination of sorts, and it may be said that, broadly speaking, [[harmony]] then took over as the predominant organizing principle in musical composition. The Baroque composer [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] wrote most of his music incorporating counterpoint, and explicitly and systematically explored the full range of contrapuntal possibilities in such works as [[The Art of Fugue]].

Given the way terminology in music history has evolved, such music created from the [[Baroque music|Baroque]] period on is described as contrapuntal, while music from before Baroque times is called [[polyphony|polyphonic]].  Hence, earlier composers such as [[Guillaume de Machaut]] and [[Josquin des Prez]] are said to have written polyphonic music.

[[Homophony]], by contrast with polyphony, features music in which [[chord (music)|chords]] or vertical [[interval (music)|intervals]] work with a single melody without much consideration of the melodic character of the added ''accompanying'' elements, or of their melodic interactions with the melody they accompany.  As suggested above, most popular music written today is predominantly homophonic, its composition governed mainly by considerations of chord and harmony; but, while general tendencies can often be fairly strong one way or another, rather than describing a musical work in absolute terms as either polyphonic or homophonic, it is a question of degree.

The form or compositional genre known as [[fugue]] is perhaps the most complex contrapuntal convention. Other examples include the [[round (music)|round]] (familiar in folk traditions) and the [[Canon (music)|canon]].

In musical composition, contrapuntal techniques are important for enabling composers to generate musical ''ironies'' that serve not only to intrigue listeners into listening more intently to the spinning out of complexities found within the [[Texture (music)|texture]] of a polyphonic composition, but also to draw them all the more into hearing the working out of these figures and interactions of musical dialogue.  A melodic fragment, heard alone, makes a particular impression; but when the fragment is heard simultaneously with other melodic ideas, or combined in unexpected ways with itself (as in a canon or fugue), greater depths of affective meaning are revealed. Through ''[[Musical development|development]]'' of a musical idea, the fragments undergo a working out into something musically greater than the sum of the parts, something conceptually more profound than a single pleasing melody.

== Species counterpoint ==

Species counterpoint is a type of so-called ''strict'' counterpoint, developed as a pedagogical tool, in which a student progresses through several &quot;species&quot; of increasing complexity, always working with a very plain given part in the [[cantus firmus]] (Latin for &quot;fixed melody&quot;). The student gradually attains the ability to write ''free'' counterpoint (that is, less rigorously constrained counterpoint, usually without a cantus firmus) according to the rules at the given time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jeppesen |first=Knud |authorlink=Knud Jeppesen |others=trans. by [[Glen Haydon]], with a new foreword by Alfred Mann |title=Counterpoint: the polyphonic vocal style of the sixteenth century |origyear=1939 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=OcSVGkug58gC |year=1992 |publisher=Dover |location=New York |isbn=048627036X }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The idea is at least as old as 1532, when Giovanni Maria Lanfranco described a similar concept in his ''Scintille di musica'' (Brescia, 1533).  The late 16th century [[Venetian School (music)|Venetian]] theorist [[Gioseffe Zarlino|Zarlino]] elaborated on the idea in his influential ''Le institutioni harmoniche'', and it was first presented in a codified form in 1619 by [[Lodovico Zacconi]] in his ''Prattica di musica''.  Zacconi, unlike later theorists, included a few extra contrapuntal techniques as species, for example [[Inversion (music)|invertible counterpoint]].

By far the most famous pedagogue to use the term, and the one who made it famous, was [[Johann Joseph Fux]].  In 1725 he published ''Gradus ad Parnassum'' (''[[Steps to Parnassus]]''), a work intended to help teach students how to compose, using counterpoint&amp;mdash;specifically, the contrapuntal style as practised by [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina|Palestrina]] in the late 16th century&amp;mdash;as the principal technique. As the basis for his simplified and often over-restrictive codification of Palestrina's practice (see ''General notes'', below), Fux described five species:

#Note against note;
#Two notes against one;
#Four (extended by others to include three, or six, etc.) notes against one;
#Notes offset against each other (as [[Nonchord tone|suspensions]]);
#All the first four species together, as &quot;florid&quot; counterpoint.

A succession of later theorists imitated Fux's seminal work quite closely, but often with some small and idiosyncratic modifications in the rules. A good example is [[Luigi Cherubini]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cherubini |first=Luigi |authorlink=Luigi Cherubini |others=with [[Fromental Halévy]] | title=Cours de contrepoint et de fugue |year=1835 |publisher=M. Schlesinger |location=Paris |oclc=11909698}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Considerations for all species===
Students of species counterpoint usually practice writing counterpoint in all the [[musical mode|modes]] except [[Locrian mode|Locrian]] (that is, [[Ionian mode|Ionian]], [[Dorian mode|Dorian]], [[Phrygian mode|Phrygian]], [[Lydian mode|Lydian]], [[Mixolydian mode|Mixolydian]] and [[Aeolian mode|Aeolian]]).  The following rules apply to melodic writing in each species, for each part:

#The final must be approached by [[Steps and skips|step]].  If the final is approached from below, the [[leading tone]] must be raised, except in the case of the Phrygian mode.  Thus, in the Dorian mode on D, a C{{music|sharp}} is necessary at the cadence.
#Permitted melodic intervals are the perfect fourth, fifth, and octave, as well as the major and minor second, major and minor third, and ascending minor sixth.  When the ascending minor sixth is used it must be immediately followed by motion downwards.
#If writing two [[Steps and skips|skips]] in the same direction—something which must be done only rarely—the second must be smaller than the first, and the interval between the first and the third note may not be dissonant.
#If writing a skip in one direction, it is best to proceed after the skip with motion in the other direction.
#The interval of a [[tritone]] in three notes is to be avoided (for example, an ascending melodic motion F - A - B natural), as is the interval of a seventh in three notes.

And, in all species, the following rules apply  concerning the combination of the parts:

#The counterpoint must begin and end on a perfect [[Consonance and dissonance|consonance]].
#[[Contrary motion]] should predominate.
#Perfect consonances must be approached by oblique or contrary motion
#Imperfect consonances may be approached by any type of motion
#The interval of a tenth should not be exceeded between two adjacent parts, unless by necessity.
#Build from the bass, upward.

Finally, in species counterpoint it is important to remember that the interval of the perfect fourth is usually considered a dissonance.

===First species===
In ''first species'' counterpoint, each note in every added part (parts being also referred to as ''lines'' or ''voices'') sounds against one note in the cantus firmus.  Notes in all parts are sounded simultaneously, and move against each other simultaneously.  The species is said to be ''expanded'' if any of the added notes are broken up (simply repeated).

In the present context, a &quot;step&quot; is a melodic interval of a half or whole step.  A &quot;skip&quot; is an interval of a third or fourth.  (See [[Steps and skips]].) An interval of a fifth or larger is referred to as a &quot;leap&quot;.

A few further rules given by Fux, by study of the Palestrina style, and usually given in the works of later counterpoint pedagogues, are as follows.  Some are vague, and since good judgement and taste have been regarded by contrapuntists as more important than strict observance of mechanical rules, there are many more cautions than prohibitions. But some are closer to being mandatory, and are accepted by most authorities.

#Begin and end on either the unison, octave, or fifth, unless the added part is underneath, in which case begin and end only on unison or octave.
#Use no unisons except at the beginning or end.
#Avoid [[Consecutive fifths|parallel fifths or octaves]] between any two parts; and avoid [[Consecutive fifths#Hidden consecutives|&quot;hidden&quot; parallel fifths or octaves]]: that is, movement by [[Contrary motion|similar motion]] to a perfect fifth or octave, unless one part (sometimes restricted to the ''higher'' of the parts) moves by step.
#Avoid moving in parallel fourths. (In practice Palestrina and others frequently allowed themselves such progressions, especially if they do not involve the lowest of the parts.)
#Avoid moving in parallel thirds or sixths for very long.
#Attempt to keep any two adjacent parts within a tenth of each other, unless an exceptionally pleasing line can be written by moving outside of that range.
#Avoid having any two parts move in the same direction by skip.
#Attempt to have as much contrary motion as possible.
#Avoid dissonant intervals between any two parts: major or minor 2nd, major or minor 7th, any augmented or diminished interval, and perfect fourth (in many contexts).

In the following example in two parts, the cantus firmus is the lower part. (The same cantus firmus is used for later examples also. Each is in the [[Dorian mode]].)
[[Image:species1.png|center|500px|thumb|Short example of &quot;First Species&quot; counterpoint ({{Audio|Species1.mid|play MIDI}})]]

===Second species===
In ''second species'' counterpoint, two notes in each of the added parts work against each longer note in the given part.  The species is said to be ''expanded'' if one of these two shorter notes differs in length from the other.

Additional considerations in second species counterpoint are as follows, and are in addition to the considerations for first species:
#It is permissible to begin on an upbeat, leaving a half-rest in the added voice.
#The accented beat must have only consonance (perfect or imperfect).  The unaccented beat may have dissonance, but only as a passing tone, i.e. it must be approached and left by step in the same direction.
#Avoid the interval of the unison except at the beginning or end of the example, except that it may occur on the unaccented portion of the bar.
#Use caution with successive accented perfect fifths or octaves.  They must not be used as part of a sequential pattern.
[[Image:species2.png|center|500px|thumb|Short example of &quot;Second Species&quot; counterpoint ({{Audio|Species2.mid|play MIDI}})]]

===Third species===
In ''third species'' counterpoint, four (or three, etc.) notes move against each longer note in the given part.  As with second species, it is called ''expanded'' if the shorter notes vary in length among themselves.
[[Image:species3.png|center|500px|thumb|Short example of &quot;Third Species&quot; counterpoint ({{Audio|Species3.mid|play MIDI}})]]

===Fourth species===
In ''fourth species'' counterpoint, some notes are sustained or ''suspended'' in an added part while notes move against them in the given part, often creating a [[Consonance and dissonance|dissonance]] on the beat, followed by the suspended note then changing (and &quot;catching up&quot;) to create a subsequent [[Consonance and dissonance|consonance]] with the note in the given part as it continues to sound. As before, fourth species counterpoint is said to be ''expanded'' when the added-part notes vary in length among themselves. The technique requires chains of notes sustained across the boundaries determined by beat, and so creates [[syncopation]].
[[Image:species4.png|center|500px|thumb|Short example of &quot;Fourth Species&quot; counterpoint ({{Audio|Species4.mid|play MIDI}})]]

===Fifth species (florid counterpoint)===
In ''fifth species'' counterpoint, sometimes called ''florid counterpoint'', the other four species of counterpoint are combined within the added parts. In the example, the first and second bars are second species, the third bar is third species, the fourth and fifth bars are third and embellished fourth species, and the final bar is first species.
[[Image:species5.png|center|500px|thumb|Short example of &quot;Florid&quot; counterpoint ({{Audio|Species5.mid|play MIDI}})]]

===General notes===
It is a common and pedantic misconception that counterpoint is ''defined'' by these five species, and therefore anything that does not follow the strict rules of the five species is not &quot;proper&quot; counterpoint. This is not true; although much contrapuntal music of the [[common practice period]] adheres to the spirit of the rules, and often to the letter of them, the exceptions are many. Fux's book and its concept of &quot;species&quot; was purely a method of teaching counterpoint, not a definitive or rigidly prescriptive set of rules for it.  He arrived at his method of teaching by examining the works of Palestrina, an important late 16th-century composer who in Fux's time was held in the highest esteem as a contrapuntist. Works in the contrapuntal style of the 16th century&amp;mdash;the &quot;[[prima pratica]]&quot; or &quot;[[stile antico]]&quot;, as it was called by later composers&amp;mdash;were often said by Fux's contemporaries to be in &quot;Palestrina style.&quot;  Indeed, Fux's treatise is a compendium of Palestrina's actual techniques, simplified and regularised for pedagogical use (and so permitting fewer liberties than occurred in actual practice).

==Contrapuntal derivations==
Since the [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] period in European music, much music which is considered contrapuntal has been written in imitative counterpoint.  In imitative counterpoint, two or more voices enter at different times, and (especially when entering) each voice repeats some version of the same melodic element.  The ''[[fantasia (music)|fantasia]]'', the ''[[ricercar]]'', and later, the [[Canon (music)|canon]] and [[fugue]] (the contrapuntal form ''par excellence'') all feature imitative counterpoint, which also frequently appears in [[choir|choral]] works such as [[motet]]s and [[madrigal (music)|madrigals]].  Imitative counterpoint has spawned a number of devices that composers have turned to in order to give their works both [[mathematical rigor]] and expressive range.  Some of these devices include: 

*[[Inversion (music)#Inverted melodies|Melodic inversion]]
:The inverse of a given fragment of melody is the fragment turned upside down—so if the original fragment has a rising major third (see [[interval (music)|interval]]), the inverted fragment has a falling major (or perhaps minor) third, etc. (Compare, in [[twelve tone technique]], the inversion of the tone row, which is the so-called prime series turned upside down.) (Note: in ''invertible counterpoint'', including ''double'' and ''triple counterpoint'', the term ''inversion'' is used in a different sense altogether. At least one pair of parts is switched, so that the one that was higher becomes lower. See [[Inversion (music)#Counterpoint|Inversion in counterpoint]]; it is not a kind of imitation, but a rearrangement of the parts.)
*[[Permutation (music)|Retrograde]]
:whereby notes in an imitative voice sound backwards in relation to their order in the original.
*[[Retrograde inversion]]
:where the imitative voice sounds notes both backwards and upside down.
*[[Augmentation (music)|Augmentation]]
:when in one of the parts in imitative counterpoint the notes are extended in duration compared to the rate at which they were sounded when introduced.
*[[Diminution]]
:when in one of the parts in imitative counterpoint the notes are reduced in duration compared to the rate at which they were sounded when introduced.

==Linear counterpoint==
[[Image:Linear counterpoint from Stravinsky's Octet.png|thumb|350px|right|Linear counterpoint from Stravinsky's Octet&lt;ref name=&quot;Katz&quot;/&gt; {{audio|Linear counterpoint from Stravinsky's Octet.mid|Play}}. Note the C major [[ostinato]] and frequent dissonances and accidentals, including [[tritone|F#]].]]

'''Linear counterpoint''' is &quot;a purely horizontal technique in which the integrity of the individual melodic lines is not sacrificed to harmonic considerations. The voice parts move freely, irrespective of the effects their combined motions may create.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Katz&quot;&gt;Katz, Adele (2007). ''Challenge to Musical Tradition - A New Concept of Tonality'', p.340. ISBN 1406757616.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, either &quot;the domination of the horizontal (linear) aspects over the vertical&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ulrich&quot;&gt;Ulrich, Homer (1962). ''Music: a Design for Listening'', p.438.&lt;/ref&gt; is featured or the &quot;harmonic control of lines is rejected.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cunningham&quot;/&gt;

Associated with [[neoclassicism (music)|neoclassicism]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Ulrich&quot;/&gt; the first work to use the technique is [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky's]] [[Octet for Wind Instruments]] (1923),&lt;ref name=&quot;Katz&quot;/&gt; inspired by [[J.S. Bach|Bach]] and [[Palestrina]]. However, according to [[Knud Jeppesen]]: &quot;Bach's and Palestrina's points of departure are antipodal. Palestrina starts out from lines and arrives at chords; Bach's music grows out of an ideally harmonic background, against which the voices develop with a bold independence that is often breath-taking.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Katz&quot;/&gt;

According to Cunningham, linear harmony is &quot;a frequent approach in the 20th-century...[in which lines] are combined with almost careless abandon in the hopes that new 'chords' and 'progressions,'...will result.&quot; It is possible with &quot;any kind of line, diatonic or [[duodecuple]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cunningham&quot;&gt;Cunningham, Michael (2007).

==Dissonant counterpoint==
'''Dissonant counterpoint''' was first theorized by [[Charles Seeger]] as &quot;at first purely a school-room discipline,&quot; consisting of species counterpoint but with all the traditional rules reversed. First species counterpoint is required to be all dissonances, establishing &quot;dissonance, rather than consonance, as the rule,&quot; and consonances are &quot;resolved&quot; through a skip, not step. He wrote that &quot;the effect of this discipline&quot; was &quot;one of purification.&quot; Other [[aspects of music|aspects of composition]], such as rhythm, could be &quot;dissonated&quot; by applying the same principle (Charles Seeger, &quot;On Dissonant Counterpoint,&quot; Modern Music 7, no. 4 (June–July 1930): 25-26).

Seeger was not the first to employ dissonant counterpoint, but was the first to theorize and promote it. Other composers who have used dissonant counterpoint, if not in the exact manner prescribed by Charles Seeger, include [[Ruth Crawford-Seeger]], [[Carl Ruggles]], [[Henry Cowell]], [[Henry Brant]], [[Dane Rudhyar]], [[Lou Harrison]], [[Fartein Valen]], and [[Arnold Schoenberg]].&lt;ref&gt;Spilker, John D., [http://etd.lib.fsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04032010-120836/unrestricted/Spilker_J_Dissertation_2010.pdf ''&quot;Substituting a New Order&quot;: Dissonant Counterpoint, Henry Cowell, and the network of ultra-modern composers''], Ph.D. dissertation, [[Florida State University]], 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other media==
[[Glenn Gould]] made innovative use of counterpoint in his three radio documentaries: ''The Idea of North'', ''The Latecomers'', and ''The Quiet in the Land'' (see [[Solitude Trilogy|The Solitude Trilogy]]).  Gould called this method &quot;contrapuntal radio.&quot; It involves the voices of two or more people simultaneously speaking (or playing against each other), entering and leaving the work as in a [[fugue]].

A '''cyanide''' is a [[chemical compound]] that contains the '''cyano group''', -C≡N, which consists of a [[carbon]] [[atom]] [[triple-bond]]ed to a [[nitrogen]] atom.&lt;ref&gt;[[IUPAC Gold Book]] [http://goldbook.iupac.org/C01486.html ''cyanides'']&lt;/ref&gt; Cyanides most commonly refer to salts of the [[anion]] CN&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Greenwood, N. N.; &amp; Earnshaw, A. (1997). Chemistry of the Elements (2nd Edn.), Oxford:Butterworth-Heinemann. ISBN 0-7506-3365-4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;G. L. Miessler and D. A. Tarr &quot;Inorganic Chemistry&quot; 3rd Ed, Pearson/Prentice Hall publisher, ISBN 0-13-035471-6.&lt;/ref&gt; Most cyanides are highly toxic.&lt;ref name=&quot;CMC&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cyanidecode.org/cyanide_environmental.php| title=Environmental and Health Effects of Cyanide| publisher=International Cyanide Management Institute|year=2006| accessdate=4 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In [[organic chemistry]] compounds containing a -C≡N group are known as [[nitrile]]s and compounds that contain the -N≡C group are known as [[isocyanide]]s. Organic nitriles and isocyanides are far less toxic because they do not release cyanide ions easily.

The dye [[Prussian blue]] had been first accidentally made, it is presumed around 1706, from substances containing iron and carbon and nitrogen, and the (then unknown) cyanide was formed during the manufacture of the dye. An [[iron]]-containing compound was found in Prussian blue and named &quot;[[ferrocyanide]]&quot;, meaning &quot;blue substance with iron&quot;, from Latin ''ferrum'' = &quot;iron&quot; and Greek ''kyanos'' = &quot;(dark) blue&quot;. When ferrocyanide was analyzed, removing the iron from the compound and from its name left &quot;cyanide&quot;.

==Nomenclature and etymology==
In [[IUPAC nomenclature of organic chemistry|IUPAC nomenclature]], [[organic compound]]s that have a&amp;nbsp;–C≡N [[functional group]] are called [[nitrile]]s. Thus, nitriles are organic compounds. &lt;ref&gt;[[IUPAC Gold Book]] [http://goldbook.iupac.org/N04151.html ''nitriles'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;NCBI-MeSH [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/68009570 ''Nitriles'']&lt;/ref&gt;
An example of a nitrile is CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CN, [[acetonitrile]], also known as [[methyl]] cyanide. 

In inorganic chemistry, salts containing the C≡N&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; ion are referred to as '''cyanides'''. 
Nitriles usually do not release cyanide ions.

A functional group with a hydroxyl and cyanide bonded to the same carbon is called [[cyanohydrin]], and cyanohydridins are hydrolyzed into [[hydrogen cyanide]] and a carbonyl compound (ketone or aldehyde).

The word &quot;cyanide&quot; was extracted from &quot;[[ferrocyanide]]&quot;, a cyanide derivative of [[iron]]. The name &quot;ferrocyanide&quot; was invented as meaning &quot;blue substance with iron&quot;, as ferrocyanides were first discovered as components of the intensely colored dye [[Prussian blue]]. ''Kyanos'' is Greek for &quot;(dark) blue&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Senning |first=Alexander |title=Elsevier's Dictionary of Chemoetymology |year=2006 |publisher=Elsevier |isbn=0444522395}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Occurrence==
Cyanides are produced by certain [[bacterium|bacteria]], [[fungi]], and [[algae]] and are found in a number of plants. Cyanides are found, although in small amounts, in certain seeds and stones, e.g., those of [[apple]], [[mango]], [[peach]], and [[bitter almonds]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/tfacts8.html |title=ToxFAQs for Cyanide |accessdate=2008-06-28 |date = July 2006|publisher=
[[Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In plants, cyanides are usually bound to [[sugar]] molecules in the form of cyanogenic [[glycoside]]s and defend the plant against [[herbivore]]s. [[Cassava]] roots (also called manioc), an important [[potato]]-like food grown in tropical countries (and the base from which [[tapioca]] is made), also contain cyanogenic glycosides.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=J. |last=Vetter |title=Plant cyanogenic glycosides |journal=Toxicon |year=2000 |volume=38 |pages=11–36 |doi=10.1016/S0041-0101(99)00128-2 |pmid=10669009 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jones&gt;{{Cite journal|first=D.

The [[cyanide radical]] CN· has been identified in interstellar space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pieniazek |first=Piotr A. |coauthors=Bradforth, Stephen E.; Krylov, Anna I. |title=Spectroscopy of the Cyano Radical in an Aqueous Environment |date=2005-12-07 |publisher=Department of Chemistry, [[University of Southern California]]|pages=4854–65|issue=14 |location=[[Los Angeles]], [[California]] 90089-0482|volume=110 |url=http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~krylov/pubs/pdf/jpca-110-4854.pdf|journal=The journal of physical chemistry. A|pmid=16599455 |format=PDF |doi=10.1021/jp0545952}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hydrogen cyanide is produced by the combustion or [[pyrolysis]] of certain materials under oxygen-deficient conditions. For example, it can be detected in the [[exhaust gas|exhaust]] of [[internal combustion engine]]s and [[tobacco]] smoke. Certain [[plastic]]s, especially those derived from [[acrylonitrile]], release hydrogen cyanide when heated or burnt.&lt;ref name=&quot;CDC&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bt.cdc.gov/Agent/cyanide/basics/facts.asp|title=Facts about cyanide:Where cyanide is found and how it is used|last=Anon|date=27 January 2004|work=CDC Emergency preparedness and response|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|accessdate=13 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coordination chemistry===
The cyanide anion is a potent [[ligand]] for many transition metals.&lt;ref&gt;Sharpe, A. G. The Chemistry of Cyano Complexes of the Transition Metals; Academic Press: London, 1976&lt;/ref&gt; The very high affinities of metals for this [[anion]] can be attributed to its negative charge, compactness, and ability to engage in π-bonding. Well-known complexes include:
*hexacyanides [M(CN)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3−&lt;/sup&gt; (M = Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co), which are octahedral in shape;
*the tetracyanides, [M(CN)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; (M = Ni, Pd, Pt), which are square planar in their geometry;
*the dicyanides [M(CN)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; (M = Cu, Ag, Au), which are linear in geometry.

The deep-[[blue]] pigment [[Prussian blue]], used in the making of [[blueprint]]s, is derived from [[iron]] cyanide complexes (hence the name ''cyanide'', from [[cyan]], a shade of blue). Prussian blue can produce hydrogen cyanide when exposed to strong acids.

Certain [[enzymes]], for example, the [[hydrogenases]], contain cyanide [[ligand]]s attached to iron in their active sites. The biosynthesis of cyanide in the [NiFe]-hydrogenases proceeds from [[carbamoyl]]phosphate, which converts to [[cystein]]yl [[thiocyanate]], the CN&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; donor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reissmann |first=Stefanie |coauthors=Elisabeth Hochleitner, Haofan Wang, Athanasios Paschos, Friedrich Lottspeich, Richard S. Glass and August Böck |title=Taming of a Poison: Biosynthesis of the NiFe-Hydrogenase Cyanide Ligands |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/299/5609/1067 |accessdate=2008-06-28 |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |year=2003 |volume=299 |issue=5609 |pages=1067–1070 |doi=10.1126/science.1080972 |pmid=12586941}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Organic derivatives===
{{Main|Nitriles}}
Because of the cyanide anion's high [[nucleophile|nucleophilicity]], cyano groups are readily introduced into organic molecules by displacement of a [[halide]] group (e.g., the [[chloride]] on [[methyl chloride]]).  In general, organic cyanides are called nitriles. Thus, CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CN can be called methyl cyanide but more commonly is referred to as [[acetonitrile]]. In organic synthesis, cyanide is a C-1 [[synthon]]; i.e., it can be used to lengthen a carbon chain by one, while retaining the ability to be [[wiktionary:functionalize|functionalized]].
:RX + CN&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → RCN + X&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; ([[nucleophilic substitution]]) followed by
# RCN + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → [[carboxylic acid|RCOOH]]  +  NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ([[hydrolysis]] under reflux with mineral acid catalyst), or
# 2 RCN + [[Lithium aluminium hydride|LiAlH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]]  + (second step) 4 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O  → [[amine|2 RCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]  +  LiAl(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (under [[reflux]] in dry [[diethyl ether|ether]], followed by addition of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)

== Manufacture ==
{{main|Hydrogen cyanide#Production and synthesis}}
The principal process used to manufacture cyanides is the [[Andrussow process]] in which gaseous [[hydrogen cyanide]] is produced from [[methane]] and [[ammonia]] in the presence of [[oxygen]] and a [[platinum]] [[catalyst]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

:CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;  +  NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;  +  1.5 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; →   HCN  +  3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

Gaseous hydrogen cyanide may be dissolved in aqueous [[sodium hydroxide]] solution to produce [[sodium cyanide]].

==Toxicity==
{{Main|Cyanide poisoning}}
Many cyanides are highly toxic. The cyanide anion is an [[enzyme inhibitor|inhibitor]] of the [[enzyme]] [[cytochrome c oxidase]] (also known as aa&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) in the fourth complex of the [[electron transport chain]] (found in the membrane of the [[mitochondria]] of eukaryotic cells).  It attaches to the iron within this protein.  The binding of cyanide to this cytochrome prevents transport of electrons from [[cytochrome c oxidase]] to oxygen. As a result, the electron transport chain is disrupted, meaning that the cell can no longer aerobically produce [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] for energy.  Tissues that depend highly on [[aerobic respiration]], such as the [[central nervous system]] and the [[heart]], are particularly affected.

The most hazardous compound is [[hydrogen cyanide]], which, because it is a gas at ambient temperatures and pressure, can be inhaled. A respirator must be worn when working with hydrogen cyanide. Hydrogen cyanide is produced when a solution containing a [[labile]] cyanide is acidified because HCN is a [[weak acid]]; alkaline solutions are safer to use because they do not evolve hydrogen cyanide. Hydrogen cyanide may be produced in the combustion of [[polyurethane]]s; for this reason, polyurethanes are not recommended for use in domestic and aircraft furniture. Oral ingestion of a small quantity — typically 200 mg — of solid cyanide or cyanide solution, and airborne exposure of 270 [[Parts per million|ppm]] may lead rapidly (within minutes) to death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;

Organic [[nitrile]]s, which do not readily release cyanide ions, have low toxicities. Compounds such as [[trimethylsilyl cyanide]] (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SiCN readily release HCN or the cyanide ion upon contact with water. 

===Antidote===
[[Hydroxycobalamin]] reacts with cyanide to form [[cyanocobalamin]], which can be eliminated by the kidneys. This method has the advantage of avoiding the formation of methemoglobin (see below). This antidote kit is sold under the brand name Cyanokit and was approved by the FDA in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/814287-treatment&lt;/ref&gt;

An older cyanide antidote kit included administration of three substances: amyl nitrite pearls (inhalation) and sodium nitrite and sodium thiosulfate (infusion). The goal of the antidote is to generate a large pool of ferric iron to compete with cytochrome a&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (part of the electron transport chain necessary for cellular respiration/energy production) for cyanide. The [[nitrite]]s [[oxidize]] [[hemoglobin]] to [[methemoglobin]], which competes with cytochrome oxidase for the cyanide ion. Cyanmethemoglobin is formed and [[cytochrome oxidase]] is restored. The major mechanism to remove the cyanide from the body is by enzymatic conversion by the [[mitochondrial]] enzyme [[rhodanese]] to convert cyanate to [[thiocyanate]], which is a relatively non-toxic molecule that is excreted in the urine. To accelerate the detoxification, sodium thiosulfate is administered to provide a sulfur donor for [[rhodanese]] to produce thiocyanate.

===Sensitivity===
Minimum risk levels (MRLs) may not protect for delayed health effects or health effects acquired following repeated sublethal exposure, such as hypersensitivity, asthma, or bronchitis. MRLs may be revised after sufficient data accumulates (Toxicological Profile for Cyanide, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2006).

==Applications==

===Mining===
{{Main|Gold cyanidation}}
Cyanide is mainly produced for the mining of [[gold]] and [[silver]]: It helps dissolve these metals and their ores.  In the  ''[[cyanide process]]'', finely ground high-grade ore is mixed with the cyanide (concentration of about two kilogram NaCN per tonne); low-grade ores are stacked into heaps and sprayed with a cyanide solution (concentration of about one kilogram NaCN per ton). The precious metals are complexed by the cyanide [[anion]]s to form soluble derivatives, e.g., [Au(CN)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; and [Ag(CN)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;Andreas Rubo, Raf Kellens, Jay Reddy, Norbert Steier, Wolfgang Hasenpusch &quot;Alkali Metal Cyanides&quot; in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2006 Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, Germany.ISBN 10.1002/14356007.i01 i01&lt;/ref&gt;
::2 Au  +  4 KCN  +  ½ O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → 2 K[Au(CN)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]  +  2 KOH

Silver is less &quot;noble&quot; than gold and often occurs as the sulfide, in which case redox is not invoked (no O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is required). Instead, a displacement reaction occurs:
::Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S  +  4 KCN  +  H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O  →   2 K[Ag(CN)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]  +  KSH  +  KOH
The &quot;pregnant liquor&quot; containing these ions is separated from the solids, which are discarded to a tailing pond or spent heap, the recoverable gold having been removed.  The metal is recovered from the &quot;pregnant solution&quot; by reduction with [[zinc]] dust or by [[adsorption]] onto [[activated carbon]]. This process can result in environmental and health problems.  Aqueous cyanide is hydrolyzed rapidly, especially in sunlight.  It can mobilize some heavy metals such as mercury if present.  Gold can also be associated with arsenopyrite (FeAsS), which is similar to [[iron pyrite]] (fool's gold), wherein half of the sulfur atoms are replaced by [[arsenic]]. Gold-containing arsenopyrite ores are similarly reactive toward inorganic cyanide.

Cyanide is also used in [[electroplating]].

===Industrial organic chemistry===
Some nitriles are produced on a large scale, e.g., adiponitrile is a precursor to [[nylon]]. Such compounds are often generated by combining hydrogen cyanide and alkenes, i.e., [[hydrocyanation]]:
RCH=CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  HCN   →   RCH(CN)CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. Metal catalysts are required for such reactions.

===Medical uses===
The cyanide compound [[sodium nitroprusside]] is used mainly in [[clinical chemistry]] to measure [[urine]] [[ketone bodies]] mainly as a follow-up to [[diabetic]] patients. On occasion, it is used in emergency medical situations to produce a rapid decrease in [[blood pressure]] in humans; it is also used as a [[vasodilator]] in vascular research. The cobalt in artificial [[Vitamin B12|vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;]] contains a cyanide ligand as an artifact of the purification process; this must be removed by the body before the vitamin molecule can be activated for biochemical use. During [[World War I]], a copper cyanide compound was briefly used by [[Japan]]ese physicians for the treatment of [[tuberculosis]] and [[leprosy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Takano |first=R. |year=1916 |month=August |title=The treatment of leprosy with cyanocuprol |journal=The Journal of Experimental Medicine |volume=24 |issue= 2|pages=207–211 |url=http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/abstract/24/2/207 |accessdate=2008-06-28 |doi=10.1084/jem.24.2.207 |pmc=2125457 |pmid=19868035}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fishing===
{{Main|Cyanide fishing}}
Cyanides are illegally used to capture live fish near [[coral reef]]s for the [[aquarium]] and seafood markets.  The practice is controversial, dangerous, and damaging but is driven by the lucrative exotic fish market.

===Niche uses===
[[Potassium ferrocyanide]] is used to achieve a blue color on cast [[bronze sculpture]]s during the final finishing stage of the sculpture. On its own, it will produce a very dark shade of blue and is often mixed with other chemicals to achieve the desired tint and hue.  It is applied using a torch and paint brush while wearing the standard safety equipment used for any patina application: rubber gloves, safety glasses, and a respirator. The actual amount of cyanide in the mixture varies according to the recipes used by each foundry.

Cyanide is also used in [[jewelry]]-making and certain kinds of [[photography]].

Cyanides are used as [[insecticide]]s for fumigating ships. Cyanide salts are used for killing ants, and have in some places been used as rat poison (the less toxic poison [[arsenic]] is more common{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}).

Although usually thought to be toxic, cyanide and cyanohydrins have been demonstrated to increase germination in various plant species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1104/pp.52.1.23 |last=Taylorson |first=R. |last2=Hendricks |year=1973 |first2=SB |title=Promotion of Seed Germination by Cyanide |journal=Plant Physiol. |volume=52 |issue=1 |pages=23–27 |pmid=16658492 |pmc=366431}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mullick |first=P. |year=1967 |last2=Chatterji |first2=U.

==Chemical tests for cyanide==
===Prussian blue===
[[Iron(II) sulfate]] is added to a solution suspected of containing cyanide, such as the filtrate from the [[sodium fusion test]]. The resulting mixture is acidified with [[mineral acid]]. The formation of [[Prussian blue]] is a positive result for cyanide.

===''para''-Benzoquinone in DMSO===
A solution of ''para''-[[benzoquinone]] in [[dimethyl sulfoxide|DMSO]] reacts with inorganic cyanide to form  a cyano[[phenol]], which is [[fluorescent]]. Illumination with a [[UV light]] gives a green/blue glow if the test is positive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1016/0041-008X(80)90225-2 | pmid = 7423496 | title = Fluorometric determination of cyanide in biological fluids with p-benzoquinone*1 | first4 = JL | last4 = Way | first3 = RL | last3 = Morgan | first2 = GE | year = 1980 | last2 = Isom | last1 = Ganjeloo | first1 = A | journal = Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology | volume = 55 | issue = 1 | pages = 103–7    }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Copper and an aromatic amine===
As used by [[fumigation|fumigators]] to detect [[hydrogen cyanide]], [[copper]](II) salt and an aromatic amine such as [[benzidine]] is added to the sample; as an alternative to benzidine an alternative amine di-(4,4-''bis''-dimethylaminophenyl) methane can be used. A positive test gives a blue color.  [[Copper(I) cyanide]] is poorly soluble. By [[sequestering]] the copper(I) the copper(II) is rendered a stronger [[oxidant]]. The copper, in a cyanide facilitated oxidation, converts the [[amine]] into a colored compound. The [[Nernst equation]] explains this process. Another good example of such chemistry is the way in which the saturated [[calomel]] [[reference electrode]] ([[saturated calomel electrode|SCE]]) works. The copper, in a cyanide-facilitated oxidation, converts the [[amine]] into a colored compound.

===Pyridine-barbituric acid colorimetry===
A sample containing inorganic cyanide is purged with air from a boiling acid solution into a basic absorber solution. The cyanide salt absorbed in the basic solution is buffered at pH 4.5 and then reacted with chlorine to form cyanogen chloride. The cyanogen chloride formed couples pyridine with barbituric acid to form a strongly colored red dye that is proportional to the cyanide concentration. This colorimetric method following distillation is the basis for most regulatory methods (for instance EPA 335.4) used to analyze cyanide in water, wastewater, and contaminated soils. Distillation followed by colorimetric methods, however, have been found to be prone to interferences from thiocyanate, nitrate, thiosulfate, sulfite, and sulfide that can result in both positive and negative bias. It has been recommended by the USEPA (MUR March 12, 2007) that samples containing these compounds be analyzed by Gas-Diffusion Flow Injection Analysis&amp;nbsp;— Amperometry.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

===Gas diffusion flow injection analysis&amp;nbsp;— amperometry===
Instead of distilling, the sample is injected into an acidic stream where the HCN formed is passed under a hydrophobic gas diffusion membrane that selectively allows only HCN to pass through. The HCN that passes through the membrane is absorbed into a basic carrier solution that transports the CN to an amperometric detector that accurately measures cyanide concentration with high sensitivity. Sample pretreatment determined by acid reagents, ligands, or preliminary UV irradiation allow cyanide speciation of free cyanide, available cyanide, and total cyanide respectively. These relative simplicity of these flow injection analysis methods limit the interference experienced by the high heat of distillation and also prove to be cost effective since time consuming distillations are not required.

[[File:Carbonate-3D-balls.png|thumb|right|200px|[[Ball-and-stick model]] of the carbonate ion, CO{{su|b=3|p=2−}}]]
In chemistry, a '''carbonate''' is a [[salt (chemistry)|salt]] of [[carbonic acid]], characterized by the presence of the '''carbonate ion''', {{chem|CO|3|2-}}.  The name may also mean an [[ester]] of carbonic acid, an organic compound containing the '''carbonate [[functional group|group]]''' C(=O)(O&amp;ndash;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

The term is also used as a verb, to describe [[carbonation]]: the process of raising the concentrations of carbonate and [[bicarbonate]] ions in water to produce [[carbonated water]] and other carbonated beverages — either by the addition of [[carbon dioxide]] gas under pressure, or by dissolving carbonate or bicarbonate salts into the water.

In [[geology]] and [[mineralogy]], the term &quot;carbonate&quot; can refer both to [[carbonate minerals]] and [[carbonate rock]] (which is made of chiefly carbonate minerals), and both are dominated by the carbonate ion, CO{{su|b=3|p=2−}}.  Carbonate minerals are extremely varied and ubiquitous in chemically-precipitated [[sedimentary rock]].  The most common are [[calcite]] or [[calcium carbonate]], CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, the chief constituent of [[limestone]] (as well as the main component of [[mollusc]] shells and [[coral]] skeletons); [[dolomite]], a calcium-magnesium carbonate  CaMg(CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;; and [[siderite]], or [[iron]] (II) carbonate, FeCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, an important [[iron ore]].  [[Sodium carbonate]] (&quot;soda&quot; or &quot;natron&quot;) and [[potassium carbonate]] (&quot;potash&quot;) have been used since antiquity for cleaning and preservation, as well as for the manufacture of [[glass]].  Carbonates are widely used in industry, e.g. in iron smelting, as a raw material for [[Portland cement]] and [[lime (mineral)|lime]] manufacture, in the composition of [[ceramic glaze]]s, and more.

==Structure and bonding==

The carbonate ion is the simplest [[oxocarbon anion]].  It consists of one [[carbon]] atom surrounded by three identical [[oxygen]] atoms, in a [[trigonal planar]] arrangement, with ''D''&lt;sub&gt;3h&lt;/sub&gt; [[Molecular symmetry#Point groups|molecular symmetry]]. It has a molecular mass of 60.01 [[dalton (unit)|daltons]] and carries a negative two [[formal charge]].  It is the [[conjugate acid|conjugate base]] of the [[bicarbonate|hydrogen carbonate (bicarbonate)]] ion, HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, which is the conjugate base of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, carbonic acid.

The [[Lewis structure]] of the carbonate ion has two (long) single bonds to negative oxygen atoms, and one short double bond to a neutral oxygen

[[File:Carbonate-ion-localised-2D.png|100px|Simple, localised Lewis structure of the carbonate ion]]

This structure is incompatible with the observed symmetry of the ion, which implies that the three bonds are equally long and that the three oxygen atoms are equivalent.  As in the case of the [[isoelectronic]] [[nitrate]] ion, the symmetry can be achieved by a [[resonance (chemistry)|resonance]] between three structures:

[[File:Carbonate-ion-resonance-2D.png|400px|Resonance structures of the carbonate ion]]

This resonance can be summarized by a model with fractional bonds and [[delocalization|delocalized]] charges:

[[File:Carbonate-ion-delocalised-partial-charges-2D.png|120px|Delocalisation and partial charges on the carbonate ion]] [[File:Carbonate-3D-vdW.png|80px|Space-filling model of the carbonate ion]]

==Chemical properties==
Metal carbonates generally decompose on heating, liberating carbon dioxide and leaving behind an oxide of the metal.  This process is called [[calcination]], after ''calx'', the Latin name of [[quicklime]] or [[calcium oxide]], CaO, which is obtained by roasting limestone in a [[lime kiln]].

A carbonate salt forms when a positively charged ion, M&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, attaches to the negatively charged oxygen atoms of the ion, forming an ionic [[chemical compound|compound]]:

:2 M&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; → M&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

:M&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; + CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; → MCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

:2 M&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; + 3 CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; → M&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

Most carbonate salts are [[solubility|insoluble]] in [[water]] at [[standard temperature and pressure]], with [[solubility constant]]s of less than 1×10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt;. Exceptions include [[sodium carbonate|sodium]], [[potassium carbonate|potassium]] and [[ammonium carbonate|ammonium]] carbonates, as well as many [[uranium carbonate]]s.

In [[aqueous solution]], carbonate, bicarbonate, carbon dioxide, and carbonic acid exist together in a [[chemical equilibrium|dynamic equilibrium]]. In strongly basic conditions, the carbonate ion predominates, while in weakly basic conditions, the [[bicarbonate]] ion is prevalent. In more acid conditions, aqueous [[carbon dioxide]], CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(aq), is the main form, which, with water, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, is in equilibrium with carbonic acid - the equilibrium lies strongly towards carbon dioxide. Thus [[sodium carbonate]] is basic, [[sodium bicarbonate]] is weakly basic, while carbon dioxide itself is a weak acid.  

[[Carbonated water]] is formed by dissolving CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in water under pressure.  When the partial pressure of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is reduced, for example when a can of soda is opened, the equilibrium for each of the forms of carbonate (carbonate, bicarbonate, carbon dioxide, and carbonic acid) shifts until the concentration of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the solution is equal to the solubility of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at that temperature and pressure.  In living systems an enzyme, [[carbonic anhydrase]], speeds the interconversion of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and carbonic acid.

==Organic carbonates==
In [[organic chemistry]] a carbonate can also refer to a [[functional group]] within a larger molecule that contains a carbon atom bound to three oxygen atoms, one of  which is double bonded. These compounds are also known as organocarbonates or carbonate esters, and have the general formula ROCOOR′, or RR′CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. Important organocarbonates include [[dimethyl carbonate]], the cyclic compounds [[ethylene carbonate]] and [[propylene carbonate]], and the toxic [[triphosgene]].

==Biological significance==
It works as a [[buffer solution|buffer]] in the blood as follows:
when pH is too low, the concentration of hydrogen ions is too high, so one exhales CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. This will cause the equation to shift left, essentially decreasing the concentration of H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions, causing a more basic pH.

When pH is too high, the concentration of hydrogen ions in the blood is too low, so the kidneys excrete bicarbonate (HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;).  This causes the equation to shift right, essentially increasing the concentration of hydrogen ions, causing a more acidic pH.

There are 3 important reversible reactions that control the above pH balance.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scifun.org/chemweek/BioBuff/BioBuffers.html&lt;/ref&gt;

1. H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(aq) {{eqm}} H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) +  HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;(aq)

2. H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(aq) {{eqm}} CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(aq)  + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O(l)

3. CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(aq) {{eqm}} CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(g)

Exhaled CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(g) depletes CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(aq) which in turn consumes H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; causing the aforementioned shift left in the first reaction by [[Le Chatelier's principle]].  By the same principle when the pH is too high, the kidneys excrete bicarbonate (HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;) into urine as urea via the Urea Cycle (aka the Krebs-Henseleit Ornithine Cycle).  By removing the bicarbonate more H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is generated from carbonic acid (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) which come from  CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(g) produced by [[cellular respiration]].

==Presence outside Earth==
It is generally thought that the presence of carbonates in [[Rock (geology)|rock]] is strong evidence for the presence of liquid water.  Recent observations of the [[Planetary nebula]] [[NGC 6302]] shows evidence for carbonates in space,&lt;ref&gt;Kemper, F., Molster, F.J., Jager, C. and Waters, L.B.F.M. (2002) The mineral composition and spatial distribution of the dust ejecta of NGC 6302.  ''Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics'' '''394''', 679-690.&lt;/ref&gt; where aqueous alteration similar to that on Earth is unlikely. Other minerals have been proposed which would fit the observations.

Significant [[Carbonates on Mars|carbonate deposits]] have not been found on Mars via remote sensing or in situ missions, even though Martian meteorites contain small amounts. Groundwater may have existed at both [[Gusev crater|Gusev]]&lt;ref&gt;Squyres et al., (2007) [http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1139045 doi 10.1126/science.1139045]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Meridiani Planum]].&lt;ref&gt;Squyres et al., (2006) [http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2006JE002771 doi 10.1029/2006JE002771]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Catalysis''' is the change in [[reaction rate|rate]] of a [[chemical reaction]] due to the participation of a substance called a catalyst. Unlike other [[reagent]]s that participate in the chemical reaction, a catalyst is not consumed by the reaction itself. A catalyst may participate in multiple chemical transformations. Catalysts that speed the reaction are called positive catalysts. Substances that interact with catalysts to slow the reaction are called inhibitors (or negative catalysts). Substances that increase the activity of catalysts are called promoters, and substances that deactivate catalysts are called catalytic poisons.

Catalytic reactions have a lower rate-limiting [[free energy (thermodynamics)|free energy of activation]] than the corresponding uncatalyzed reaction, resulting in higher reaction rate at the same temperature. However, the mechanistic explanation of catalysis is complex. Catalysts may affect the reaction environment favorably, or bind to the reagents to polarize bonds, e.g. [[acid catalyst]]s for reactions of [[carbonyl]] compounds, or form specific intermediates that are not produced naturally, such as osmate [[ester]]s in [[osmium tetroxide]]-catalyzed [[dihydroxylation]] of [[alkene]]s, or cause [[lysis]] of reagents to reactive forms, such as [[atomic hydrogen]] in [[catalytic hydrogenation]].

[[Chemical kinetics|Kinetically]], catalytic reactions are typical [[chemical reactions]]; i.e. the reaction rate depends on the frequency of contact of the reactants in the rate-determining step.  Usually, the catalyst participates in this slowest step, and rates are limited by amount of catalyst and its &quot;activity&quot;.  In [[heterogeneous catalysis]], the diffusion of reagents to the surface and diffusion of products from the surface can be rate determining. Analogous events associated with [[substrate (chemistry)|substrate]] binding and product dissociation apply to homogeneous catalysts.

Although catalysts are not consumed by the reaction itself, they may be inhibited, deactivated, or destroyed by secondary processes.  In heterogeneous catalysis, typical secondary processes include [[coking]] where the catalyst becomes covered by [[polymer]]ic side products.  Additionally, heterogeneous catalysts can dissolve into the solution in a solid-liquid system or evaporate in a solid-gas system.

==Background==
The production of most industrially important chemicals involves catalysis. Similarly, most biochemically significant processes are catalysed.  Research into catalysis is a major field in [[applied science]] and involves many areas of chemistry, notably in [[organometallic chemistry]] and [[materials science]].  Catalysis is relevant to many aspects of [[environmental science]], e.g. the [[catalytic converter]] in automobiles and the dynamics of the [[ozone hole]]. Catalytic reactions are preferred in environmentally friendly [[green chemistry]] due to the reduced amount of waste generated,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The 12 Principles of Green Chemistry | work=[[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] | url=http://www.epa.gov/greenchemistry/pubs/principles.html | accessdate=2006-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; as opposed to [[stoichiometric]] reactions in which all reactants are consumed and more side products are formed. The most common catalyst is the proton (H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;). Many [[transition metal]]s and transition metal [[Complex (chemistry)|complexes]] are used in catalysis as well. Catalysts called [[enzyme]]s are important in [[biology]].

A catalyst works by providing an alternative reaction pathway to the reaction product. The rate of the reaction is increased as this alternative route has a lower [[activation energy]] than the reaction route not mediated by the catalyst.  The [[disproportionation]] of [[hydrogen peroxide]] to give water and [[oxygen]] is a reaction that is strongly affected by catalysts:
:2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;   →   2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O  +  O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
This reaction is favoured in the sense that reaction products are more stable than the starting material, however the uncatalysed reaction is slow. The decomposition of hydrogen peroxide is in fact so slow that hydrogen peroxide solutions are commercially available.  Upon the addition of a small amount of [[manganese dioxide]], the hydrogen peroxide rapidly reacts according to the above equation.  This effect is readily seen by the [[Effervescence (chemistry)|effervescence]] of oxygen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher = [[University of Minnesota]] | title = Genie in a Bottle | url = http://www.chem.umn.edu/services/lecturedemo/info/genie.htm  | date = 2005-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The manganese dioxide may be recovered unchanged, and re-used indefinitely, and thus is not consumed in the reaction. Accordingly, manganese dioxide ''catalyses'' this reaction.&lt;ref&gt;Masel, Richard I. “Chemical Kinetics and Catalysis” Wiley-Interscience, New York, 2001. ISBN 0471241970.&lt;/ref&gt;

==General principles of catalysis==
===Typical mechanism===
{{Main|catalytic cycle}}
Catalysts generally react with one or more reactants to form intermediates that subsequently give the final reaction product, in the process regenerating the catalyst. The following is a typical reaction scheme, where '''''C''''' represents the catalyst, X and Y are reactants, and Z is the product of the reaction of X and Y:
:X + '''''C''''' → X'''''C'''''  (1)
:Y + X'''''C''''' → XY'''''C''''' (2)
:XY'''''C''''' → '''''C'''''Z (3)
:'''''C'''''Z → '''''C''''' + Z (4)

Although the catalyst is consumed by reaction 1, it is subsequently produced by reaction 4, so for the overall reaction:
:X + Y → Z
As a catalyst is regenerated in a reaction, often only small amounts are needed to increase the rate of the reaction. In practice, however, catalysts are sometimes consumed in secondary processes.'''''

As an example of this process, in 2008 Danish researchers first revealed the sequence of events when [[oxygen]] and [[hydrogen]] combine on the surface of [[titanium dioxide]] (TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, or ''titania'') to produce water.  With a time-lapse series of [[scanning tunneling microscopy]] images, they determined the molecules undergo [[adsorption]], [[dissociation (chemistry)|dissociation]] and [[diffusion]] before reacting.  The intermediate reaction states were: HO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, then H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and the final reaction product (water molecule [[Dimer (chemistry)|dimer]]s), after which the water molecule [[desorption|desorbs]] from the catalyst surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

===Catalysis and reaction energetics===
[[Image:CatalysisScheme.png|thumb|right|292px|Generic potential energy diagram showing the effect of a catalyst in a hypothetical exothermic chemical reaction X + Y to give Z. The presence of the catalyst opens a different reaction pathway (shown in red) with a lower activation energy. The final result and the overall thermodynamics are the same.]]
Catalysts work by providing an (alternative) mechanism involving a different [[transition state]] and lower [[activation energy]]. Consequently,  more molecular collisions have the energy needed to reach the transition state. Hence, catalysts can enable reactions that would otherwise be blocked or slowed by a kinetic barrier.  The catalyst may increase reaction rate or selectivity, or enable the reaction at lower temperatures. This effect can be illustrated with a [[Boltzmann distribution]] and [[Energy profile (chemistry)|energy profile]] diagram.

In the catalyzed [[elementary reaction]], catalysts do '''not''' change the extent of a reaction: they have '''no''' effect on the [[chemical equilibrium]] of a reaction because the rate of both the forward and the reverse reaction are both affected (see also [[thermodynamics]]).  The fact that a catalyst does not change the equilibrium is a consequence of the [[second law of thermodynamics]].  Suppose there was such a catalyst that shifted an equilibrium. Introducing the catalyst to the system would result in reaction to move to the new equilibrium, producing energy. Production of energy is a necessary result since reactions are spontaneous if and only if [[Gibbs free energy]] is produced, and if there is no energy barrier, there is no need for a catalyst. Then, removing the catalyst would also result in reaction, producing energy; i.e. the addition and its reverse process, removal, would both produce energy. Thus, a catalyst that could change the equilibrium would be a [[perpetual motion machine]], a contradiction to the laws of thermodynamics.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, A.J.B. Catalysis of Gas Reactions by Metals. Logos Press, London, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;

If a catalyst '''does''' change the equilibrium, then it must be consumed as the reaction proceeds, and thus it is also a reactant. Illustrative is the base-catalysed [[hydrolysis]] of [[ester]]s, where the produced [[carboxylic acid]] immediately reacts with the base catalyst and thus the reaction equilibrium is shifted towards hydrolysis.

The [[SI derived unit]] for measuring the '''catalytic activity''' of a catalyst is the [[katal]], which is moles per second. The productivity of a catalyst can be described by the [[turn over number]] (or TON) and the catalytic activity by the ''turn over frequency'' (TOF), which is the TON per time unit. The biochemical equivalent is the [[enzyme unit]].  For more information on the efficiency of enzymatic catalysis, see the article on [[Enzyme#Kinetics|Enzymes]].

The catalyst stabilizes the transition state more than it stabilizes the starting material.  It decreases the kinetic barrier by decreasing the ''difference'' in energy between starting material and transition state.

===Typical catalytic materials===
The chemical nature of catalysts is as diverse as catalysis itself, although some generalizations can be made.  Proton [[acids]] are probably the most widely used catalysts, especially for the many reactions involving water, including hydrolysis and its reverse.  Multifunctional solids often are catalytically active, e.g. [[zeolite]]s, [[alumina]], higher-order oxides, graphitic carbon, nanoparticles, nanodots, and facets of bulk materials.  [[Transition metals]] are often used to catalyze [[redox]] reactions (oxidation, hydrogenation).  Many catalytic processes, especially those used in organic synthesis, require so called &quot;late transition metals&quot;, which include [[palladium]], [[platinum]], [[gold]], [[ruthenium]], [[rhodium]], and [[iridium]].

Some so-called catalysts are really '''precatalysts'''.  Precatalysts convert to catalysts in the reaction. For example, [[Wilkinson's catalyst]] RhCl(PPh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; loses one triphenylphosphine ligand before entering the true catalytic cycle. Precatalysts are easier to store but are easily activated in situ. Because of this preactivation step, many catalytic reactions involve an [[induction period]].

Chemical species that improve catalytic activity are called '''co-catalysts''' ('''cocatalysts''') or '''promotors''' in '''cooperative catalysis'''.

==Types of catalysis==
Catalysts can be either [[heterogeneous]] or [[wiktionary:Homogeneous|homogeneous]], depending on whether a catalyst exists in the same [[phase (matter)|phase]] as the [[substrate (chemistry)|substrate]]. [[Biocatalysts]] (enzymes) are often seen as a separate group.

===Heterogeneous catalysts===
{{Main|Heterogeneous catalysis}}
Heterogeneous catalysts act in a different [[phase (matter)|phase]] than the [[reactants]].  Most heterogeneous catalysts are [[solid]]s that act on substrates in a [[liquid]] or gaseous [[reaction mixture]].  Diverse mechanisms for [[reactions on surfaces]] are known, depending on how the adsorption takes place ([[Reactions on surfaces#Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism|Langmuir-Hinshelwood]], [[Reactions on surfaces#Eley-Rideal mechanism|Eley-Rideal]], and Mars-van Krevelen).&lt;ref&gt;Helmut Knözinger, Karl Kochloefl “Heterogeneous Catalysis and Solid Catalysts” in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2002, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a05_313}}. Article Online Posting Date: January 15, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; The total surface area of solid has an important effect on the reaction rate. The smaller the catalyst particle size, the larger the surface area for a given mass of particles.

For example, in the [[Haber process]], finely divided [[iron]] serves as a catalyst for the synthesis of [[ammonia]] from [[nitrogen]] and [[hydrogen]]. The reacting [[gas]]es [[adsorb]] onto &quot;active sites&quot; on the iron particles. Once adsorbed, the bonds within the reacting molecules are weakened, and new bonds between the resulting fragments form in part due to their close proximity. In this way the particularly strong [[triple bond]] in nitrogen is weakened and the hydrogen and nitrogen atoms combine faster than would be the case in the gas phase, so the rate of reaction increases.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} Another place where an Heterogeneous Catalyst is applied is in Contact Process. 

Heterogeneous catalysts are typically “[[catalyst support|supported]],” which means that the catalyst is dispersed on a second material that enhances the effectiveness or minimizes their cost.  Sometimes the support is merely a surface on which the catalyst is spread to increase the surface area.  More often, the support and the catalyst interact, affecting the catalytic reaction. Supports are porous materials with a high surface area, most commonly [[alumina]] or various kinds of [[carbon]].  Specialized supports include [[silicon dioxide]], [[titanium dioxide]], [[calcium carbonate]], and [[barium sulfate]].

===Homogeneous catalysts===
{{Main|Homogeneous catalysis}}
Homogeneous catalysts function in the same phase as the reactants, but the mechanistic principles invoked in heterogeneous catalysis are generally applicable. Typically homogeneous catalysts are dissolved in a solvent with the substrates.  One example of homogeneous catalysis involves the influence of [[hydrogen|H]]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; on the [[esterification]] of esters, e.g. methyl acetate from acetic acid and methanol.&lt;ref&gt;Arno Behr “Organometallic Compounds and Homogeneous Catalysis” Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2002, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a18_215}}. Article Online Posting Date: June 15, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;  For inorganic chemists, homogeneous catalysis is often synonymous with [[organometallic chemistry|organometallic catalysts]].&lt;ref&gt;Elschenbroich, C. ”Organometallics” (2006) Wiley-VCH: Weinheim. ISBN 978-3-29390-6&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electrocatalysts===
{{Main|Electrocatalyst}}
In the context of [[electrochemistry]], specifically in [[fuel cell]] engineering, various metal-containing catalysts are used to enhance the rates of the [[half reaction]]s that comprise the fuel cell. One common type of fuel cell electrocatalyst is based upon [[nanoparticles]] of [[platinum]] that are supported on slightly larger [[carbon]] particles. When in contact with one of the [[electrodes]] in a fuel cell, this platinum increases the rate of [[oxygen]] reduction to water, either to [[hydroxide]] or [[hydrogen peroxide]].

===Organocatalysis===
{{Main|Organocatalysis}}
Whereas transition metals sometimes attract most of the attention in the study of catalysis, small organic molecules without metals can also exhibit catalytic properties, as is apparent from the fact that many [[enzymes]] lack transition metals.  Typically, organic catalysts require a higher loading (amount of catalyst per unit amount of reactant, expressed in [[mol%]] [[amount of substance]]) than  transition metal(-ion)-based catalysts, but these catalysts are usually commercially available in bulk, helping to reduce costs.  In the early 2000s, these organocatalysts were considered &quot;new generation&quot; and are competitive to traditional [[metal]](-ion)-containing catalysts.  Organocatalysts are supposed to operate akin to metal-free enzymes utilizing, e.g., non-covalent interactions such as [[hydrogen bonding]]. The discipline organocatalysis is divided in the application of covalent (e.g., [[proline]], [[DMAP]]) and non-covalent (e.g., [[thiourea organocatalysis]]) organocatalysts referring to the preferred catalyst-[[Substrate (chemistry)|substrate]] [[binding (molecular)|binding]] and interaction, respectively.

==Significance of catalysis==
Estimates are that 90% of all commercially produced chemical products involve catalysts at some stage in the process of their manufacture.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Recognizing the Best in Innovation: Breakthrough Catalyst&quot;. ''R&amp;D Magazine'', September 2005, pg 20.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, catalytic processes generated about $900 billion in products worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.climatetechnology.gov/library/2005/tech-options/tor2005-143.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  Catalysis is so pervasive that subareas are not readily classified.  Some areas of particular concentration are surveyed below.

===Energy processing===
[[Petroleum]] refining makes intensive use of catalysis for [[alkylation]], [[catalytic cracking]] (breaking long-chain hydrocarbons into smaller pieces), [[naphtha]] reforming and [[steam reforming]] (conversion of [[hydrocarbons]] into [[synthesis gas]]).  Even the exhaust from the burning of fossil fuels is treated via catalysis: [[Catalytic converter]]s, typically composed of [[platinum]] and [[rhodium]], break down some of the more harmful byproducts of automobile exhaust.
:2 CO  +  2 NO   →   2 CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

With regard to  synthetic fuels, an old but still important process is the [[Fischer-Tropsch synthesis]] of hydrocarbons from [[synthesis gas]], which itself is processed via [[water gas shift reaction|water-gas shift reaction]]s, catalysed by iron.  [[Biodiesel]] and related biofuels require processing via both inorganic and biocatalysts.

[[Fuel cells]] rely on catalysts for both the anodic and cathodic reactions.

===Bulk chemicals===
Some of the largest-scale chemicals are produced via catalytic oxidation, often using [[oxygen]].  Examples include [[nitric acid]] (from ammonia), [[sulfuric acid]] (from [[sulfur dioxide]] to [[sulfur trioxide]] by the [[chamber process]]), [[terephthalic acid]] from p-xylene, and [[acrylonitrile]] from propane and ammonia.

Many other chemical products are generated by large-scale reduction, often via [[hydrogenation]].  The largest-scale example is [[ammonia]], which is prepared via the [[Haber process]] from [[nitrogen]].  [[Methanol]] is prepared from [[carbon monoxide]].

Bulk polymers derived from [[ethylene]] and [[propylene]] are often prepared via [[Ziegler-Natta catalysis]].  Polyesters, polyamides, and [[isocyanate]]s are derived via [[acid-base catalysis]].

Most [[carbonylation]] processes require metal catalysts, examples include the [[Monsanto acetic acid process]] and [[hydroformylation]].

===Fine chemicals===
Many fine chemicals are prepared via catalysis; methods include those of heavy industry as well as more specialized processes that would be prohibitively expensive on a large scale.  Examples include [[olefin metathesis]] using [[Grubbs' catalyst]], the [[Heck reaction]], and [[Friedel-Crafts reaction]]s.

Because most bioactive compounds are [[Chirality (chemistry)|chiral]], many pharmaceuticals are produced by enantioselective catalysis (catalytic [[asymmetric synthesis]]).

===Food processing===
One of the most obvious applications of catalysis is the hydrogenation (reaction with [[hydrogen]] gas) of fats using [[nickel]] catalyst to produce [[margarine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher = Chemguide | title = Types of catalysis | url = http://www.chemguide.co.uk/physical/catalysis/introduction.html | accessdate = 2008-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many other foodstuffs are prepared via biocatalysis (see below).

===Biology===
{{Main|Biocatalysis}}
In nature, [[enzyme]]s are catalysts in [[metabolism]] and [[catabolism]].  Most biocatalysts are protein-based, i.e. enzymes, but other classes of biomolecules also exhibit catalytic properties including [[ribozyme]]s, and synthetic [[deoxyribozyme]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, D. L.; Cox, M. M. &quot;Lehninger, Principles of Biochemistry&quot; 3rd Ed. Worth Publishing: New York, 2000. ISBN 1-57259-153-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Biocatalysts can be thought of as intermediate between homogenous and heterogeneous catalysts, although strictly speaking soluble enzymes are homogeneous catalysts and [[Biological membrane|membrane]]-bound enzymes are heterogeneous. Several factors affect the activity of enzymes (and other catalysts) including temperature, pH, concentration of enzyme, substrate, and products.  A particularly important reagent in enzymatic reactions is water, which is the product of many bond-forming reactions and a reactant in many bond-breaking processes.

Enzymes are employed to prepare many commodity chemicals including [[high-fructose corn syrup]] and [[acrylamide]].

===In the environment===
Catalysis impacts the environment by increasing the efficiency of industrial processes, but catalysis also plays a direct role in the environment.  A notable example is the catalytic role of [[chlorine]] [[free radical]]s in the breakdown of [[ozone]]. These radicals are formed by the action of [[ultraviolet]] [[radiation]] on [[chlorofluorocarbon]]s (CFCs).
:Cl&lt;sup&gt;'''·'''&lt;/sup&gt;  +  O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;  →   ClO&lt;sup&gt;'''·'''&lt;/sup&gt;  +  O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
:ClO&lt;sup&gt;'''·'''&lt;/sup&gt;  +  O&lt;sup&gt;·&lt;/sup&gt;  →  Cl&lt;sup&gt;'''·'''&lt;/sup&gt;  +  O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

==History==
In a general sense, anything that increases the rate of a process is a &quot;catalyst&quot;, a term derived from [[Greek language|Greek]] [[wikt:καταλύω|καταλύειν]], meaning &quot;to annul,&quot; or &quot;to untie,&quot; or &quot;to pick up.&quot;  The phrase ''catalysed processes'' was coined by [[Jöns Jakob Berzelius]] in 1836&lt;ref&gt;[[Keith J. Laidler]] and J.H. Meiser, Physical Chemistry, Benjamin/Cummings (1982), p.423&lt;/ref&gt; to describe reactions that are accelerated by substances that remain unchanged after the reaction. Other early chemists involved in catalysis were [[Alexander Mitscherlich]] who referred to ''contact processes'' and [[Johann Wolfgang Döbereiner]] who spoke of ''contact action'' and whose [[Lighter (fire starter)|lighter]] based on [[hydrogen]] and a [[platinum]] sponge became a huge commercial success in the 1820s. [[Humphry Davy]] discovered the use of platinum in catalysis. In the 1880s, [[Wilhelm Ostwald]] at [[Leipzig University]] started a systematic investigation into reactions that were catalyzed by the presence of [[acids]] and bases, and found that chemical reactions occur at finite rates and that these rates can be used to determine the strengths of acids and bases. For this work, Ostwald was awarded the 1909 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Inhibitors, poisons and promoters ==
Substances that reduce the action of catalysts are called catalyst inhibitors if reversible, and catalyst poisons if irreversible. Promoters are substances that increase the catalytic activity, even though they are not catalysts by themselves.

Inhibitors are sometimes referred to as &quot;negative catalysts&quot; since they decrease the reaction rate. However they do not work by introducing a reaction path with higher activation energy, as this term might suggest; this would not reduce the rate since the reaction would continue to occur by the non-catalyzed path. Instead they act either by inactivating catalysts, or by removing reaction intermediates such as free radicals.&lt;ref&gt;K.J. Laidler Physical Chemistry with Biological Applications, Benjamin/Cummings 1978, p.415-417&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; K.J. Laidler and J.H. Meiser, Physical Chemistry, Benjamin/Cummings (1982), p.425 
&lt;/ref&gt;

The inhibitor may modify selectivity in addition to rate. For instance, in the reduction of [[ethyne]] to [[ethene]], the catalyst is [[palladium]] (Pd) partly &quot;poisoned&quot; with [[lead(II) acetate]] (Pb(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COO)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Without the deactivation of the catalyst, the ethene produced will be further reduced to [[ethane]].&lt;ref&gt;W.P. Jencks, “Catalysis in Chemistry and Enzymology” McGraw-Hill, New York, 1969. ISBN 0070323054&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Myron L Bender, Makoto Komiyama, Raymond J Bergeron “The Bioorganic Chemistry of Enzymatic Catalysis” Wiley-Interscience, Hoboken, U.S., 1984 ISBN 0471059919&lt;/ref&gt;

The inhibitor can produce this effect by e.g. selectively poisoning only certain types of active sites. Another mechanism is the modification of surface geometry. For instance, in hydrogenation operations, large planes of metal surface function as sites of [[hydrogenolysis]] catalysis while sites catalyzing [[hydrogenation]] of unsaturates are smaller. Thus, a poison that covers surface randomly will tend to reduce the number of uncontaminated large planes but leave proportionally more smaller sites free, thus changing the hydrogenation vs. hydrogenolysis selectivity. Many other mechanisms are also possible.

Promoters can cover up surface to prevent production of a mat of coke, or even actively remove such material (e.g. rhenium on platinum in [[platforming]]). They can aid the dispersion of the catalytic material or bind to reagents.

==Current market==
The global demand on catalysts in 2007 was estimated at approximately 850 thousand tonnes. The market in volume is expected to grow by 3.5-4% annually through 2012, while the market in value will develop much faster. Surging price of precious metals (e.g. platinum and rhodium) is a main contributor to the rapidly growing catalysts market in value. The market is experiencing influences from environmental regulations, rising raw material prices, call for green chemistry, etc. It is a dramatically changing market with opportunities and risks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Market Report: World Catalyst Market | publisher = [http://www.acmite.com Acmite Market Intelligence] | url = http://www.acmite.com/market-reports/chemicals/world-catalyst-market.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The circumference of a [[circle]] can be calculated from its [[diameter]] using the formula:

:&lt;math&gt;c=\pi\cdot{d}.\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Or, substituting the [[radius]] for the diameter:

:&lt;math&gt;c=2\pi\cdot{r}=\pi\cdot{2r},\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''r''}} is the [[radius]] and {{math|''d''}} is the diameter of the circle, and the Greek letter {{pi}} is defined as the ratio of the circumference of the circle to its diameter. The numerical value of {{pi}} is 3.141 592 653 589 793....

== Circumference of an ellipse==&lt;!--  section is linked from [[Spherical Earth]] --&gt;
The circumference of an [[ellipse]] is more problematic, as the exact solution requires finding the [[complete elliptic integral of the second kind]]. This can be achieved either via [[numerical integration]] (the best type being [[Gaussian quadrature]]) or by one of many [[binomial series]] expansions.

Where {{math|a}},{{math|b}} are the ellipse's [[semi-major axis|semi-major]] and [[semi-minor axis|semi-minor]] axes, respectively, and {{math|α}} is the ellipse's [[angular eccentricity]],

&lt;math&gt;\alpha=\arccos\!\left(\frac{b}{a}\right)=2\arctan\!\left(\!\sqrt{\frac{a-b}{a+b}}\,\right);\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}\mbox{E2}\left[0,90^\circ\right]&amp;= \mbox{Integral}'s\mbox{ divided difference};\\ Pr&amp;=a\times\mbox{E2}\left[0,90^\circ\right] \quad(\mbox{perimetric radius});\\
c&amp;=2\pi\times Pr.\end{align}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

There are many different [[approximation]]s for the {{math|E2 [0,90°]}} [[Difference quotient|divided difference]], with varying degrees of sophistication and corresponding accuracy.

In comparing the different approximations, the &lt;math&gt;\tan^2\!\left(\frac{\alpha}{2}\right)\,\!&lt;/math&gt; (also known as &quot;{{math|n}}&quot;, the third [[flattening]] of the ellipse) based series expansion is used to find the actual value:

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}\mbox{E2}\left[0,90^\circ\right]
&amp;=\cos^2\!\left(\frac{\alpha}{2}\right)\frac{1}{UT}\sum_{TN=1}^{UT=\infty}{.5\choose{}TN}^2\tan^{4TN}\!\left(\frac{\alpha}{2}\right),\\
&amp;=\cos^2\!\left(\frac{\alpha}{2}\right)\Bigg(1+\frac{1}{4}\tan^4\!\left(\frac{\alpha}{2}\right)
+\frac{1}{64}\tan^8\!\left(\frac{\alpha}{2}\right)\\ &amp;\qquad\qquad\qquad\;\,+\frac{1}{256}\tan^{12}\!\left(\frac{\alpha}{2}\right)
+\frac{25}{16384}\tan^{16}\!\left(\frac{\alpha}{2}\right)
+...\Bigg);\end{align}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

More generally, the [[arc length]] of a portion of the circumference, as a function of the angle subtended, is given by an incomplete [[elliptic integral]].
{{See also|Meridian arc#Meridian distance on the ellipsoid}}
The [[inverse function]], the angle subtended as a function of the arc length, is given by the [[elliptic functions]].

=== Muir-1883 ===
:Probably the most accurate to its given simplicity is [[Thomas Muir (mathematician)|Thomas Muir's]]:
::&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}Pr
&amp;\approx\left(\frac{a^{1.5}+b^{1.5}}{2}\right)^\frac{1}{1.5}=a\left(\frac{1+\cos^{1.5}\!\left(\alpha\right)}{2}\right)^\frac{1}{1.5},\\
&amp;\quad\approx{a}\times\cos^2\!\left(\frac{\alpha}{2}\right)\left(1+\frac{1}{4}\tan^4\!\left(\frac{\alpha}{2}\right)\right).\end{align}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

=== Ramanujan-1914 (#1,#2) ===
:[[Srinivasa Ramanujan]] introduced ''two'' different approximations, both from 1914
::&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}1.\;Pr&amp;\approx\frac{1}{2}\Big(3(a+b)-\sqrt{\big(3a+b\big)\big(a+3b\big)}\Big),\\
&amp;\quad=\frac{a}{2}\bigg(6\cos^2\!\left(\frac{\alpha}{2}\right)-\sqrt{\big(3+\cos\!\left(\alpha\right)\big)\big(1+3\cos\!\left(\alpha\right)\big)}\bigg);\end{align}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}2.\;Pr&amp;\approx\frac{1}{2}\Big(a+b\Big)\Bigg(1+\frac{3\big(\frac{a-b}{a+b}\big)^2}{10+\sqrt{4-3\big(\frac{a-b}{a+b}\big)^2}}\Bigg);\\
&amp;\quad=a\times\cos^2\!\left(\frac{\alpha}{2}\right)\Bigg(1+\frac{3\tan^4\!\big(\frac{\alpha}{2}\big)}{10+\sqrt{4-3\tan^4\!\big(\frac{\alpha}{2}\big)}}\Bigg).\end{align}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

:The second equation is demonstrably by far the better of the two, and may be the most accurate approximation known.

Letting {{math|a}} = 10000 and {{math|b}} = {{math|a}}×cos&lt;nowiki&gt;{&lt;/nowiki&gt;{{math|oε}}&lt;nowiki&gt;}&lt;/nowiki&gt;, results with different ellipticities can be found and compared:

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Continuum mechanics}}{{Classical mechanics|cTopic=Branches}}
'''Continuum mechanics''' is a branch of [[mechanics]] that deals with the analysis of the [[kinematic]]s and the mechanical behavior of materials modeled as a continuous mass rather than as discrete particles. The French mathematician [[Augustin Louis Cauchy]] was the first to formulate such models in the 19th century, but research in the area continues today.

Modeling an object as a continuum assumes that the substance of the object completely fills the space it occupies. Modeling objects in this way ignores the fact that matter is made of [[atom]]s, and so is not continuous; however, on [[length scale]]s much greater than that of inter-atomic distances, such models are highly accurate. Fundamental physical laws such as the [[conservation of mass]], the [[conservation of momentum]], and the [[conservation of energy]] may be applied to such models to derive [[differential equations]] describing the behavior of such objects, and some information about the particular material studied is added through a [[constitutive relation]].

Continuum mechanics deals with physical properties of solids and fluids which are independent of any particular [[coordinate system]] in which they are observed. These physical properties are then represented by [[tensor]]s, which are mathematical objects that have the required property of being independent of coordinate system. These tensors can be expressed in coordinate systems for computational convenience.

==The concept of a continuum==
Materials, such as solids, liquids and gases, are composed of [[molecules]] separated by empty space. On a macroscopic scale, materials have cracks and discontinuities. However, certain physical phenomena can be modeled assuming the materials exist as a '''continuum, meaning the matter in the body is continuously distributed and fills the entire region of space it occupies'''. A continuum is a body that can be continually sub-divided into [[infinitesimal]] elements with properties being those of the bulk material.

The validity of the continuum assumption may be verified by a theoretical analysis, in which either some clear periodicity is identified or [[Homogeneity (statistics)|statistical homogeneity]] and [[ergodicity]] of the [[microstructure]] exists. More specifically, the continuum hypothesis/assumption hinges on the concepts of a [[Representative elementary volume|''representative volume element'' (RVE)]] (sometimes called &quot;representative elementary volume&quot;) and ''separation of scales'' based on the [[Hill–Mandel condition]]. This condition provides a link between an experimentalist's and a theoretician's viewpoint on constitutive equations (linear and nonlinear elastic/inelastic or coupled fields) as well as a way of spatial and statistical averaging of the microstructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Microstructural randomness and scaling in mechanics of materials |last=Ostoja-Starzewski |first=M. |year=2008 |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=1-584-88417-7 |chapter= 7-10 |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=_Qyf1woZPNgC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the separation of scales does not hold, or when one wants to establish a continuum of a finer resolution than that of the RVE size, one employs a ''statistical volume element'' (SVE), which, in turn, leads to random continuum fields. The latter then provide a micromechanics basis for stochastic finite elements (SFE). The levels of SVE and RVE link continuum mechanics to [[statistical mechanics]]. The RVE may be assessed only in a limited way via experimental testing: when the constitutive response becomes spatially homogeneous. 

Specifically for [[fluid]]s, the [[Knudsen number]] is used to assess to what extent the approximation of continuity can be made.

==Major areas of continuum mechanics==
{{Continuum mechanics context}}

==Formulation of models==
[[Image:Continuum body.svg|200px|right|thumb|Figure 1. Configuration of a continuum body]]
Continuum mechanics models begin by assigning a region in three dimensional [[Euclidean space]] to the material body &lt;math&gt;\mathcal B&lt;/math&gt; being modeled. The points within this region are called particles or material points. Different ''configurations'' or states of the body correspond to different regions in Euclidean space. The region corresponding to the body's configuration at time &lt;math&gt;\ t&lt;/math&gt; is labeled &lt;math&gt;\ \kappa_t(\mathcal B)&lt;/math&gt;.

A particular particle within the body in a particular configuration is characterized by a position vector &lt;br /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\ \mathbf x =\sum_{i=1}^3 x_i \mathbf e_i&lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf e_i&lt;/math&gt; are the [[coordinate vector]]s in some [[frame of reference]] chosen for the problem (See figure 1). This vector can be expressed as a [[function (mathematics)|function]] of the particle position &lt;math&gt;\mathbf X&lt;/math&gt; in some ''reference configuration'', for example the configuration at the initial time, so that&lt;br /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}=\kappa_t(\mathbf X)&lt;/math&gt;.
This function needs to have various properties so that the model makes physical sense. &lt;math&gt;\kappa_t(\cdot)&lt;/math&gt; needs to be:
* [[continuity (mathematics)|continuous]] in time, so that the body changes in a way which is realistic,
* globally [[inverse function|invertible]] at all times, so that the body cannot intersect itself,
* [[orientation-preserving]], as transformations which produce mirror reflections are not possible in nature.
For the mathematical formulation of the model, &lt;math&gt;\ \kappa_t(\cdot)&lt;/math&gt; is also assumed to be [[continuously differentiable|twice continuously differentiable]], so that differential equations describing the motion may be formulated.

==Forces in a continuum==
{{see also|Stress (mechanics)}}
Continuum mechanics deals with deformable bodies, as opposed to [[rigid bodies]]. A solid is a deformable body that possesses shear strength, ''sc.'' a solid can support shear forces (forces parallel to the material surface on which they act). Fluids, on the other hand, do not sustain shear forces. For the study of the mechanical behavior of solids and fluids these are assumed to be continuous bodies, which means that the matter fills the entire region of space it occupies, despite the fact that matter is made of atoms, has voids, and is discrete. Therefore, when continuum mechanics refers to a point or particle in a continuous body it does not describe a point in the interatomic space or an atomic particle, rather an idealized part of the body occupying that point.

Following the classical dynamics of [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] and [[Leonhard Euler|Euler]], the motion of a material body is produced by the action of externally applied forces which are assumed to be of two kinds: surface forces &lt;math&gt;\mathbf F_C&lt;/math&gt; and body forces &lt;math&gt;\mathbf F_B&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;Smith &amp; Truesdell p.97&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the total force &lt;math&gt;\mathcal F&lt;/math&gt; applied to a body or to a portion of the body can be expressed as:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal F = \mathbf F_B + \mathbf F_C&lt;/math&gt;

''[[Surface forces]]'' or ''contact forces'', expressed as force per unit area, can act either on the bounding surface of the body, as a result of mechanical contact with other bodies, or on imaginary internal surfaces that bound portions of the body, as a result of the mechanical interaction between the parts of the body to either side of the surface ([[Stress (mechanics)#Euler-Cauchy's stress principle|Euler-Cauchy's stress principle]]). When a body is acted upon by external contact forces, internal contact forces are then transmitted from point to point inside the body to balance their action, according to [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's second law of motion]] of conservation of [[linear momentum]] and [[angular momentum]] (for continuous bodies these laws are called the [[Euler's laws|Euler's equations of motion]]). The internal contact forces are related to the body's [[deformation (mechanics)|deformation]] through [[constitutive equations]]. The internal contact forces may be mathematically described by how they relate to the motion of the body, independent of the body's material makeup.&lt;ref&gt;Slaughter&lt;/ref&gt;

The distribution of internal contact forces throughout the volume of the body is assumed to be continuous. Therefore, there exists a ''contact force density'' or ''Cauchy traction field'' &lt;ref name=Smith/&gt; &lt;math&gt;\mathbf T(\mathbf n, \mathbf x, t)&lt;/math&gt; that represents this distribution in a particular configuration of the body at a given time &lt;math&gt;t\,\!&lt;/math&gt;. It is not a vector field because it depends not only on the position &lt;math&gt;\mathbf x&lt;/math&gt; of a particular material point, but also on the local orientation of the surface element as defined by its normal vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf n&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=Lubliner&gt;Lubliner&lt;/ref&gt;

Any differential area &lt;math&gt;dS\,\!&lt;/math&gt; with normal vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf n&lt;/math&gt; of a given internal surface area &lt;math&gt;S\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, bounding a portion of the body, experiences a contact force &lt;math&gt;d\mathbf F_C\,\!&lt;/math&gt; arising from the contact between both portions of the body on each side of &lt;math&gt;S\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, and it is given by

:&lt;math&gt;d\mathbf F_C= \mathbf T^{(\mathbf n)}\,dS&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf T^{(\mathbf n)}&lt;/math&gt; is the ''surface traction'',&lt;ref name=Liu/&gt; also called ''stress vector'',&lt;ref name=Wu/&gt; ''traction'',&lt;ref name=Fung&gt;Fung&lt;/ref&gt; or ''traction vector'',.&lt;ref name=Mase&gt;Mase&lt;/ref&gt; The stress vector is a frame-indifferent vector (see [[Stress (mechanics)#Euler-Cauchy's stress principle|Euler-Cauchy's stress principle]]).

The total contact force on the particular internal surface &lt;math&gt;S\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is then expressed as the sum ([[surface integral]]) of the contact forces on all differential surfaces &lt;math&gt;dS\,\!&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf F_C=\int_S \mathbf T^{(\mathbf n)}\,dS&lt;/math&gt;

In continuum mechanics a body is considered stress-free if the only forces present are those inter-atomic forces ([[ionic bond|ionic]], [[metallic bond|metallic]], and [[van der Waals force]]s) required to hold the body together and to keep its shape in the absence of all external influences, including gravitational attraction.&lt;ref name=Mase/&gt;&lt;ref name=Atanackovic&gt;Atanackovic&lt;/ref&gt; Stresses generated during manufacture of the body to a specific configuration are also excluded when considering stresses in a body. Therefore, the stresses considered in continuum mechanics are only those produced by deformation of the body, ''sc.'' only relative changes in stress are considered, not the absolute values of stress.

''[[Body forces]]'' are forces originating from sources outside of the body&lt;ref name=Irgens&gt;Irgens&lt;/ref&gt; that act on the volume (or mass) of the body. Saying that body forces are due to outside sources implies that the interaction between different parts of the body (internal forces) are manifested through the contact forces alone.&lt;ref name=Liu&gt;Liu&lt;/ref&gt; These forces arise from the presence of the body in force fields, ''e.g.'' [[gravitational field]] ([[gravitational force]]s) or electromagnetic field ([[electromagnetic force]]s), or from [[fictitious force|inertial forces]] when bodies are in motion. As the mass of a continuous body is assumed to be continuously distributed, any force originating from the mass is also continuously distributed. Thus, body forces are specified by vector fields which are assumed to be continuous over the entire volume of the body,&lt;ref name=Chadwick&gt;Chadwick&lt;/ref&gt; ''i.e.'' acting on every point in it. Body forces are represented by a body force density &lt;math&gt;\mathbf b(\mathbf x, t)&lt;/math&gt; (per unit of mass), which is a frame-indifferent vector field.

In the case of gravitational forces, the intensity of the force depends on, or is proportional to, the mass density &lt;math&gt;\mathbf \rho (\mathbf x, t)\,\!&lt;/math&gt; of the material, and it is specified in terms of force per unit mass (&lt;math&gt;b_i\,\!&lt;/math&gt;) or per unit volume (&lt;math&gt;p_i\,\!&lt;/math&gt;). These two specifications are related through the material density by the equation &lt;math&gt;\rho b_i = p_i\,\!&lt;/math&gt;. Similarly, the intensity of electromagnetic forces depends upon the strength ([[electric charge]]) of the electromagnetic field.

The total body force applied to a continuous body is expressed as

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf F_B=\int_V\mathbf b\,dm=\int_V \rho\mathbf b\,dV&lt;/math&gt;

Body forces and contact forces acting on the body lead to corresponding moments of force ([[torque]]s) relative to a given point. Thus, the total applied torque &lt;math&gt;\mathcal M&lt;/math&gt; about the origin is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal M= \mathbf M_B + \mathbf M_C&lt;/math&gt;

In certain situations, not commonly considered in the analysis of the mechanical behavior or materials, it becomes necessary to include two other types of forces: these are ''body moments'' and ''couple stresses''&lt;ref&gt;Maxwell pointed out that nonvanishing body moments exist in a magnet in a magnetic field and in a dielectric material in an electric field with different planes of polarization. Fung p.76.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Couple stresses and body couples were first explored by Voigt and Cosserat, and later reintroduced by Mindlin in 1960 on his work for Bell Labs on pure quartz crystals. Richards p.55.&lt;/ref&gt; (surface couples,&lt;ref name=Irgens/&gt; contact torques&lt;ref name=Chadwick/&gt;). Body moments, or body couples, are moments per unit volume or per unit mass applied to the volume of the body. Couple stresses are moments per unit area applied on a surface. Both are important in the analysis of stress for a polarized dielectric solid under the action of an electric field, materials where the molecular structure is taken into consideration (''e.g.'' bones), solids under the action of an external magnetic field, and the dislocation theory of metals.&lt;ref name=Wu&gt;Wu&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fung/&gt;&lt;ref name=Irgens/&gt;

Materials that exhibit body couples and couple stresses in addition to moments produced exclusively by forces are called ''polar materials''.&lt;ref name=Fung/&gt;&lt;ref name=Chadwick/&gt; ''Non-polar materials'' are then those materials with only moments of forces. In the classical branches of continuum mechanics the development of the theory of stresses is based on non-polar materials.

Thus, the sum of all applied forces and torques (with respect to the origin of the coordinate system) in the body can be given by

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal F = \int_V \mathbf a\,dm = \int_S \mathbf T\,dS + \int_V \rho\mathbf b\,dV&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal M = \int_S \mathbf r \times \mathbf T\,dS + \int_V \mathbf r \times \rho\mathbf b\,dV&lt;/math&gt;

==Kinematics: deformation and motion==
[[Image:Displacement of a continuum.svg|400px|right|thumb|Figure 2. Motion of a continuum body.]]
A change in the configuration of a continuum body results in a [[displacement field (mechanics)|displacement]]. The displacement of a body has two components: a rigid-body displacement and a [[Deformation (mechanics)|deformation]]. A rigid-body displacement consist of a simultaneous translation and rotation of the body without changing its shape or size. Deformation implies the change in shape and/or size of the body from an initial or undeformed configuration &lt;math&gt;\ \kappa_0(\mathcal B)&lt;/math&gt; to a current or deformed configuration &lt;math&gt;\ \kappa_t(\mathcal B)&lt;/math&gt; (Figure 2).

The motion of a continuum body is a continuous time sequence of displacements. Thus, the material body will occupy different configurations at different times so that a particle occupies a series of points in space which describe a pathline.

There is continuity during deformation or motion of a continuum body in the sense that:
* The material points forming a closed curve at any instant will always form a closed curve at any subsequent time.
* The material points forming a closed surface at any instant will always form a closed surface at any subsequent time and the matter within the closed surface will always remain within.

It is convenient to identify a reference configuration or initial condition which all subsequent configurations are referenced from. The reference configuration need not be one that the body will ever occupy. Often, the configuration at &lt;math&gt;\ t=0&lt;/math&gt; is considered the reference configuration , &lt;math&gt;\ \kappa_0 (\mathcal B)&lt;/math&gt;. The components &lt;math&gt;\ X_i&lt;/math&gt; of the position vector &lt;math&gt;\ \mathbf X&lt;/math&gt; of a particle, taken with respect to the reference configuration, are called the material or reference coordinates.

When analyzing the [[Deformation (mechanics)|deformation]] or motion of solids, or the [[fluid mechanics|flow]] of fluids, it is necessary to describe the sequence or evolution of configurations throughout time. One description for motion is made in terms of the material or referential coordinates, called material description or Lagrangian description.

===Lagrangian description===
In the Lagrangian description the position and physical properties of the particles are described in terms of the material or referential coordinates and time. In this case the reference configuration is the configuration at &lt;math&gt;\ t=0&lt;/math&gt;. An observer standing in the referential frame of reference observes the changes in the position and physical properties as the material body moves in space as time progresses. The results obtained are independent of the choice of initial time and reference configuration, &lt;math&gt;\kappa_0(\mathcal B)&lt;/math&gt;. This description is normally used in [[solid mechanics]].

In the Lagrangian description, the motion of a continuum body is expressed by the mapping function &lt;math&gt;\ \chi(\cdot)&lt;/math&gt; (Figure 2),

:&lt;math&gt;\ \mathbf x=\chi(\mathbf X, t)&lt;/math&gt;

which is a mapping of the initial configuration &lt;math&gt;\kappa_0(\mathcal B)&lt;/math&gt; onto the current configuration &lt;math&gt;\kappa_t(\mathcal B)&lt;/math&gt;, giving a geometrical correspondence between them, i.e. giving the position vector &lt;math&gt;\ \mathbf{x}=x_i\mathbf e_i&lt;/math&gt; that a particle &lt;math&gt;\ X&lt;/math&gt;, with a position vector &lt;math&gt;\ \mathbf X&lt;/math&gt; in the undeformed or reference configuration &lt;math&gt;\kappa_0(\mathcal B)&lt;/math&gt;, will occupy in the current or deformed configuration &lt;math&gt;\kappa_t(\mathcal B)&lt;/math&gt; at time &lt;math&gt;\ t&lt;/math&gt;. The components &lt;math&gt;\ x_i&lt;/math&gt; are called the spatial coordinates.

Physical and kinematic properties &lt;math&gt;\ P_{ij\ldots}&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. thermodynamic properties and velocity, which describe or characterize features of the material body, are expressed as continuous functions of position and time, i.e. &lt;math&gt;\  P_{ij\ldots}=P_{ij\ldots}(\mathbf X,t)&lt;/math&gt;.

The material derivative of any property &lt;math&gt;\ P_{ij\ldots}&lt;/math&gt; of a continuum, which may be a scalar, vector, or tensor, is the time rate of change of that property for a specific group of particles of the moving continuum body. The material derivative is also known as the ''substantial derivative'', or ''comoving derivative'', or ''convective derivative''. It can be thought as the rate at which the property changes when measured by an observer traveling with that group of particles.

In the Lagrangian description, the material derivative of &lt;math&gt;\ P_{ij\ldots}&lt;/math&gt; is simply the partial derivative with respect to time, and the position vector &lt;math&gt;\ \mathbf X&lt;/math&gt; is held constant as it does not change with time. Thus, we have

:&lt;math&gt;\ \frac{d}{dt}[P_{ij\ldots}(\mathbf X,t)]=\frac{\partial}{\partial t}[P_{ij\ldots}(\mathbf X,t)]&lt;/math&gt;

The instantaneous position &lt;math&gt;\ \mathbf x&lt;/math&gt; is a property of a particle, and its material derivative is the ''instantaneous velocity'' &lt;math&gt;\ \mathbf v&lt;/math&gt; of the particle. Therefore, the velocity field of the continuum is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\ \mathbf v = \mathbf \dot x =\frac{d\mathbf x}{dt}=\frac{\partial \chi(\mathbf X,t)}{\partial t} &lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, the acceleration field is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\ \mathbf a= \mathbf \dot v = \mathbf \ddot x =\frac{d^2\mathbf x}{dt^2}=\frac{\partial^2 \chi(\mathbf X,t)}{\partial t^2} &lt;/math&gt;

Continuity in the Lagrangian description is expressed by the spatial and temporal continuity of the mapping from the reference configuration to the current configuration of the material points. All physical quantities characterizing the continuum are described this way. In this sense, the function &lt;math&gt;\chi(\cdot)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\ P_{ij\ldots}(\cdot)&lt;/math&gt; are single-valued and continuous, with continuous derivatives with respect to space and time to whatever order is required, usually to the second or third.

===Eulerian description===
Continuity allows for the inverse of &lt;math&gt;\chi(\cdot)&lt;/math&gt; to trace backwards where the particle currently located at &lt;math&gt;\mathbf x&lt;/math&gt; was located in the initial or referenced configuration &lt;math&gt;\kappa_0(\mathcal B)&lt;/math&gt;. In this case the description of motion is made in terms of the spatial coordinates, in which case is called the spatial description or Eulerian description, i.e. the current configuration is taken as the reference configuration.

The Eulerian description, introduced by [[d'Alembert]], focuses on the current configuration &lt;math&gt;\kappa_t(\mathcal B)&lt;/math&gt;, giving attention to what is occurring at a fixed point in space as time progresses, instead of giving attention to individual particles as they move through space and time. This approach is conveniently applied in the study of [[fluid mechanics|fluid flow]] where the kinematic property of greatest interest is the rate at which change is taking place rather than the shape of the body of fluid at a reference time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spencer83&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Continuum Mechanics |last=Spencer |first=A.J.M. |year=1980 |publisher=Longman Group Limited (London) |isbn=0-582-44282-6 |page=83 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=AJdfQL0rgrgC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mathematically, the motion of a continuum using the Eulerian description is expressed by the mapping function

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf X=\chi^{-1}(\mathbf x, t)&lt;/math&gt;

which provides a tracing of the particle which now occupies the position &lt;math&gt;\mathbf x&lt;/math&gt; in the current configuration &lt;math&gt;\kappa_t(\mathcal B)&lt;/math&gt; to its original position &lt;math&gt;\mathbf X&lt;/math&gt; in the initial configuration &lt;math&gt;\kappa_0(\mathcal B)&lt;/math&gt;.

A necessary and sufficient condition for this inverse function to exist is that the determinant of the [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobian Matrix]], often referred to simply as the Jacobian, should be different from zero. Thus,

:&lt;math&gt;\ J=\left | \frac{\partial \chi_i}{\partial X_J} \right |=\left | \frac{\partial x_i}{\partial X_J} \right |\neq0&lt;/math&gt;

In the Eulerian description, the physical properties &lt;math&gt;\ P_{ij\ldots}&lt;/math&gt; are expressed as

:&lt;math&gt;\ P_{ij \ldots}=P_{ij\ldots}(\mathbf X,t)=P_{ij\ldots}[\chi^{-1}(\mathbf x,t),t]=p_{ij\ldots}(\mathbf x,t)&lt;/math&gt;

where the functional form of &lt;math&gt;\ P_{ij \ldots}&lt;/math&gt; in the Lagrangian description is not the same as the form of &lt;math&gt;\ p_{ij \ldots}&lt;/math&gt; in the Eulerian description.

The material derivative of &lt;math&gt;\ p_{ij\ldots}(\mathbf x,t)&lt;/math&gt;, using the chain rule, is then

:&lt;math&gt;\ \frac{d}{dt}[p_{ij\ldots}(\mathbf x,t)]=\frac{\partial}{\partial t}[p_{ij\ldots}(\mathbf x,t)]+ \frac{\partial}{\partial x_k}[p_{ij\ldots}(\mathbf x,t)]\frac{dx_k}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;

The first term on the right-hand side of this equation gives the ''local rate of change'' of the property &lt;math&gt;\ p_{ij\ldots}(\mathbf x,t)&lt;/math&gt; occurring at position &lt;math&gt;\ \mathbf x&lt;/math&gt;. The second term of the right-hand side is the ''convective rate of change'' and expresses the contribution of the particle changing position in space (motion).

Continuity in the Eulerian description is expressed by the spatial and temporal continuity and continuous differentiability of the velocity field. All physical quantities are defined this way at each instant of time, in the current configuration, as a function of the vector position &lt;math&gt;\ \mathbf x&lt;/math&gt;.

===Displacement field===
The vector joining the positions of a particle &lt;math&gt;\ P&lt;/math&gt; in the undeformed configuration and deformed configuration is called the [[displacement (vector)|displacement vector]] &lt;math&gt;\ \mathbf u(\mathbf X,t)=u_i\mathbf e_i&lt;/math&gt;, in the Lagrangian description, or &lt;math&gt;\ \mathbf U(\mathbf x,t)=U_J\mathbf E_J&lt;/math&gt;, in the Eulerian description.
 
A ''displacement field'' is a vector field of all displacement vectors for all particles in the body, which relates the deformed configuration with the undeformed configuration. It is convenient to do the analysis of deformation or motion of a continuum body in terms of the displacement field,  In general, the displacement field is expressed in terms of the material coordinates as

:&lt;math&gt;\ \mathbf u(\mathbf X,t) = \mathbf b+\mathbf x(\mathbf X,t) - \mathbf X \qquad \text{or}\qquad u_i = \alpha_{iJ}b_J + x_i - \alpha_{iJ}X_J&lt;/math&gt;

or in terms of the spatial coordinates as

:&lt;math&gt;\ \mathbf U(\mathbf x,t) = \mathbf b+\mathbf x - \mathbf X(\mathbf x,t) \qquad \text{or}\qquad U_J = b_J + \alpha_{Ji}x_i - X_J \,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\ \alpha_{Ji}&lt;/math&gt; are the direction cosines between the material and spatial coordinate systems with unit vectors &lt;math&gt;\ \mathbf E_J&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf e_i&lt;/math&gt;, respectively. Thus

:&lt;math&gt;\ \mathbf E_J \cdot \mathbf e_i = \alpha_{Ji}=\alpha_{iJ}&lt;/math&gt;

and the relationship between &lt;math&gt;\ u_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\ U_J&lt;/math&gt; is then given by

:&lt;math&gt;\ u_i=\alpha_{iJ}U_J \qquad \text{or} \qquad U_J=\alpha_{Ji}u_i&lt;/math&gt;

Knowing that
:&lt;math&gt;\ \mathbf e_i = \alpha_{iJ}\mathbf E_J&lt;/math&gt;
then
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf u(\mathbf X,t)=u_i\mathbf e_i=u_i(\alpha_{iJ}\mathbf E_J)=U_J\mathbf E_J=\mathbf U(\mathbf x,t)&lt;/math&gt;

It is common to superimpose the coordinate systems for the undeformed and deformed configurations, which results in &lt;math&gt;\ \mathbf b=0&lt;/math&gt;,  and the direction cosines become [[Kronecker delta]]s, i.e.

:&lt;math&gt;\ \mathbf E_J \cdot \mathbf e_i = \delta_{Ji}=\delta_{iJ}&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, we have

:&lt;math&gt;\ \mathbf u(\mathbf X,t) = \mathbf x(\mathbf X,t) - \mathbf X \qquad \text{or}\qquad u_i = x_i - \delta_{iJ}X_J&lt;/math&gt;

or in terms of the spatial coordinates as

:&lt;math&gt;\ \mathbf U(\mathbf x,t) = \mathbf x - \mathbf X(\mathbf x,t) \qquad \text{or}\qquad U_J = \delta_{Ji}x_i - X_J &lt;/math&gt;

===Conservation of energy=== --&gt;

==Governing equations==
Continuum mechanics deals with the behavior of materials that can be approximated as continuous for certain length and time scales.  The equations that govern the mechanics of such materials include the balance laws for [[conservation of mass|mass]], [[conservation of momentum|momentum]], and [[conservation of energy|energy]].  [[Kinematic]] relations and [[constitutive equations]] are needed to complete the system of governing equations.  Physical restrictions on the form of the constitutive relations can be applied by requiring that the [[second law of thermodynamics]] be satisfied under all conditions.  In the continuum mechanics of solids, the second law of thermodynamics is satisfied if the [[Clausius–Duhem inequality|Clausius–Duhem]] form of the entropy inequality is satisfied.

The balance laws express the idea that the rate of change of a quantity (mass, momentum, energy) in a volume must arise from three causes:
  
#the physical quantity itself flows through the surface that bounds the volume,
#there is a source of the physical quantity on the surface of the volume, or/and,
#there is a source of the physical quantity inside the volume.
  
Let &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; be the body (an open subset of Euclidean space) and let   &lt;math&gt;\partial \Omega &lt;/math&gt; be its surface (the boundary of &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;).  
  
Let the motion of material points in the body be described by the map
:&lt;math&gt;
    \mathbf{x} = \boldsymbol{\chi}(\mathbf{X}) = \mathbf{x}(\mathbf{X})
  &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{X}&lt;/math&gt; is the position of a point in the initial configuration and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt; is the location of the same point in the deformed configuration.

The deformation gradient is given by
:&lt;math&gt;
    \boldsymbol{F} = \frac{\partial \mathbf{x}}{\partial \mathbf{X}} = \boldsymbol \mathbf{x} \cdot \nabla  ~.
  &lt;/math&gt;

===Balance laws===
Let &lt;math&gt;f(\mathbf{x},t)&lt;/math&gt; be a physical quantity that is flowing through the body.  Let &lt;math&gt;g(\mathbf{x},t)&lt;/math&gt; be sources on the surface of the body and let &lt;math&gt;h(\mathbf{x},t)&lt;/math&gt; be sources inside the body.  Let &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{n}(\mathbf{x},t)&lt;/math&gt; be the outward unit normal to the surface &lt;math&gt;\partial \Omega &lt;/math&gt;.  Let &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}(\mathbf{x},t)&lt;/math&gt; be the velocity of the physical particles that carry the physical quantity that is flowing.  Also, let the speed at which the bounding surface &lt;math&gt;\partial \Omega &lt;/math&gt; is moving be &lt;math&gt;u_n&lt;/math&gt; (in the direction &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{n}&lt;/math&gt;).

Then, balance laws can be expressed in the general form
:&lt;math&gt;
    \cfrac{d}{dt}\left[\int_{\Omega} f(\mathbf{x},t)~\text{dV}\right] = 
      \int_{\partial \Omega } f(\mathbf{x},t)[u_n(\mathbf{x},t) - \mathbf{v}(\mathbf{x},t)\cdot\mathbf{n}(\mathbf{x},t)]~\text{dA} + 
      \int_{\partial \Omega } g(\mathbf{x},t)~\text{dA} + \int_{\Omega} h(\mathbf{x},t)~\text{dV} ~.
  &lt;/math&gt;
Note that the functions &lt;math&gt;f(\mathbf{x},t)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;g(\mathbf{x},t)&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;h(\mathbf{x},t)&lt;/math&gt; can be scalar valued, vector valued, or tensor valued - depending on the physical quantity that the balance equation deals with.  If there are internal boundaries in the body, jump discontinuities also need to be specified in the balance laws.

If we take the [[Lagrangian]] point of view, it can be shown that the balance laws of mass, momentum, and energy for a solid can be written as
:&lt;math&gt;
    {
    \begin{align}
      \dot{\rho} + \rho~\boldsymbol{\nabla} \cdot \mathbf{v} &amp; = 0 
          &amp; &amp; \qquad\text{Balance of Mass} \\
      \rho~\dot{\mathbf{v}} - \boldsymbol{\nabla} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} - \rho~\mathbf{b} &amp; = 0 
          &amp; &amp; \qquad\text{Balance of Linear Momentum} \\
      \boldsymbol{\sigma} &amp; = \boldsymbol{\sigma}^T
          &amp; &amp; \qquad\text{Balance of Angular Momentum} \\
      \rho~\dot{e} - \boldsymbol{\sigma}:(\boldsymbol{\nabla}\mathbf{v}) + \boldsymbol{\nabla} \cdot \mathbf{q} - \rho~s &amp; = 0
          &amp; &amp; \qquad\text{Balance of Energy.}
    \end{align}
    }
  &lt;/math&gt;

In the above equations &lt;math&gt;\rho(\mathbf{x},t)&lt;/math&gt; is the mass density (current),   &lt;math&gt;\dot{\rho}&lt;/math&gt; is the material time derivative of &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}(\mathbf{x},t)&lt;/math&gt; is the particle velocity, &lt;math&gt;\dot{\mathbf{v}}&lt;/math&gt; is the material time derivative of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\sigma}(\mathbf{x},t)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Cauchy stress tensor]], &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{b}(\mathbf{x},t)&lt;/math&gt; is the body force density, &lt;math&gt;e(\mathbf{x},t)&lt;/math&gt; is the internal energy per unit mass, &lt;math&gt;\dot{e}&lt;/math&gt; is the material time derivative of &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{q}(\mathbf{x},t)&lt;/math&gt; is the heat flux vector, and &lt;math&gt;s(\mathbf{x},t)&lt;/math&gt; is an energy source per unit mass.
  
With respect to the reference configuration, the balance laws can be written as
:&lt;math&gt;
    {
    \begin{align}
      \rho~\det(\boldsymbol{F}) - \rho_0 &amp;= 0 &amp; &amp;  \qquad \text{Balance of Mass} \\
      \rho_0~\ddot{\mathbf{x}} - \boldsymbol{\nabla}_{\circ}\cdot\boldsymbol{P}^T -\rho_0~\mathbf{b} &amp; = 0  &amp; &amp; 
        \qquad \text{Balance of Linear Momentum} \\
      \boldsymbol{F}\cdot\boldsymbol{P}^T &amp; = \boldsymbol{P}\cdot\boldsymbol{F}^T  &amp; &amp; 
        \qquad \text{Balance of Angular Momentum} \\ 
      \rho_0~\dot{e} - \boldsymbol{P}^T:\dot{\boldsymbol{F}} + \boldsymbol{\nabla}_{\circ}\cdot\mathbf{q} - \rho_0~s &amp; = 0
          &amp; &amp; \qquad\text{Balance of Energy.} 
    \end{align}
    }
  &lt;/math&gt;

In the above, &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{P}&lt;/math&gt; is the first [[Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensor]], and   &lt;math&gt;\rho_0&lt;/math&gt; is the mass density in the reference configuration.  The first   Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensor is related to the Cauchy stress tensor by
:&lt;math&gt;
    \boldsymbol{P} = J~\boldsymbol{\sigma}\cdot\boldsymbol{F}^{-T}
   ~\text{where}~ J = \det(\boldsymbol{F})
  &lt;/math&gt;

We can alternatively define the nominal stress tensor &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{N}&lt;/math&gt; which is the transpose of the first Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensor such that
:&lt;math&gt;
    \boldsymbol{N} = \boldsymbol{P}^T = J~\boldsymbol{F}^{-1}\cdot\boldsymbol{\sigma} ~.
  &lt;/math&gt;
Then the balance laws become
:&lt;math&gt;
    {
    \begin{align}
      \rho~\det(\boldsymbol{F}) - \rho_0 &amp;= 0 &amp; &amp;  \qquad \text{Balance of Mass} \\
      \rho_0~\ddot{\mathbf{x}} - \boldsymbol{\nabla}_{\circ}\cdot\boldsymbol{N} -\rho_0~\mathbf{b} &amp; = 0  &amp; &amp; 
        \qquad \text{Balance of Linear Momentum} \\
      \boldsymbol{F}\cdot\boldsymbol{N} &amp; = \boldsymbol{N}^T\cdot\boldsymbol{F}^T  &amp; &amp; 
        \qquad \text{Balance of Angular Momentum} \\ 
      \rho_0~\dot{e} - \boldsymbol{N}:\dot{\boldsymbol{F}} + \boldsymbol{\nabla}_{\circ}\cdot\mathbf{q} - \rho_0~s &amp; = 0
          &amp; &amp; \qquad\text{Balance of Energy.} 
    \end{align}
    }
  &lt;/math&gt;

The operators in the above equations are defined as such that
:&lt;math&gt;
    \boldsymbol{\nabla} \mathbf{v} = \sum_{i,j = 1}^3 \frac{\partial v_i}{\partial x_j}\mathbf{e}_i\otimes\mathbf{e}_j = 
        v_{i,j}\mathbf{e}_i\otimes\mathbf{e}_j ~;~~
    \boldsymbol{\nabla} \cdot \mathbf{v} =  \sum_{i=1}^3 \frac{\partial v_i}{\partial x_i} = v_{i,i} ~;~~
    \boldsymbol{\nabla} \cdot \boldsymbol{S} = \sum_{i,j=1}^3 \frac{\partial S_{ij}}{\partial x_j}~\mathbf{e}_i 
          = \sigma_{ij,j}~\mathbf{e}_i ~.
  &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt; is a vector field, &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{S}&lt;/math&gt; is a second-order tensor field, and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_i&lt;/math&gt; are the components of an orthonormal basis in the current configuration.  Also,
:&lt;math&gt;
    \boldsymbol{\nabla}_{\circ} \mathbf{v} = \sum_{i,j = 1}^3 \frac{\partial v_i}{\partial X_j}\mathbf{E}_i\otimes\mathbf{E}_j = 
        v_{i,j}\mathbf{E}_i\otimes\mathbf{E}_j ~;~~
    \boldsymbol{\nabla}_{\circ}\cdot\mathbf{v} =  \sum_{i=1}^3 \frac{\partial v_i}{\partial X_i} = v_{i,i} ~;~~
    \boldsymbol{\nabla}_{\circ}\cdot\boldsymbol{S} = \sum_{i,j=1}^3 \frac{\partial S_{ij}}{\partial X_j}~\mathbf{E}_i = S_{ij,j}~\mathbf{E}_i 
  &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt; is a vector field, &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{S}&lt;/math&gt; is a second-order tensor field, and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E}_i&lt;/math&gt; are the components of an orthonormal basis in the reference configuration.

The inner product is defined as
:&lt;math&gt;
    \boldsymbol{A}:\boldsymbol{B} = \sum_{i,j=1}^3 A_{ij}~B_{ij} = trace(\boldsymbol{A}\boldsymbol{B}^T) ~.
  &lt;/math&gt;

===The Clausius&amp;ndash;Duhem inequality===
The [[Clausius&amp;ndash;Duhem inequality]] can be used to express the second law of thermodynamics for elastic-plastic materials.  This inequality is a statement concerning the irreversibility of natural processes, especially when energy dissipation is involved.

Just like in the balance laws in the previous section, we assume that there is a flux of a quantity, a source of the quantity, and an internal density of the quantity per unit mass.  The quantity of interest in this case is the entropy.  Thus, we assume that there is an entropy flux, an entropy source, and an internal entropy density per unit mass (&lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt;) in the region of interest.

Let &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; be such a region and let &lt;math&gt;\partial \Omega &lt;/math&gt; be its boundary.  Then the second law of thermodynamics states that the rate of increase of  &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; in this region is greater than or equal to the sum of that supplied to &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; (as a flux or from internal sources) and the change of the internal entropy density due to material flowing in and out of the region.
  
Let &lt;math&gt;\partial \Omega &lt;/math&gt; move with a velocity &lt;math&gt;u_n&lt;/math&gt; and let particles inside &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; have velocities &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt;.  Let &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{n}&lt;/math&gt; be the unit outward normal to the surface &lt;math&gt;\partial \Omega &lt;/math&gt;.  Let &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; be the density of matter in the region, &lt;math&gt;\bar{q}&lt;/math&gt; be the entropy flux at the surface, and &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; be the entropy source per unit mass.  
Then the entropy inequality may be written as
:&lt;math&gt;
    \cfrac{d}{dt}\left(\int_{\Omega} \rho~\eta~\text{dV}\right) \ge
    \int_{\partial \Omega} \rho~\eta~(u_n - \mathbf{v}\cdot\mathbf{n})~\text{dA} + 
    \int_{\partial \Omega} \bar{q}~\text{dA} + \int_{\Omega} \rho~r~\text{dV}.
  &lt;/math&gt;
The scalar entropy flux can be related to the vector flux at the surface by the relation &lt;math&gt;\bar{q} = -\boldsymbol{\psi}(\mathbf{x})\cdot\mathbf{n}&lt;/math&gt;.  Under the assumption  of incrementally isothermal conditions, we have
:&lt;math&gt;
    \boldsymbol{\psi}(\mathbf{x}) = \cfrac{\mathbf{q}(\mathbf{x})}{T} ~;~~ r = \cfrac{s}{T}
  &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{q}&lt;/math&gt; is the heat flux vector, &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; is a energy source per unit mass, and &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the absolute temperature of a material point at &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt; at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;.

We then have the Clausius&amp;ndash;Duhem inequality in integral form:
:&lt;math&gt;
    {
    \cfrac{d}{dt}\left(\int_{\Omega} \rho~\eta~\text{dV}\right) \ge
    \int_{\partial \Omega} \rho~\eta~(u_n - \mathbf{v}\cdot\mathbf{n})~\text{dA} - 
    \int_{\partial \Omega} \cfrac{\mathbf{q}\cdot\mathbf{n}}{T}~\text{dA} + \int_\Omega \cfrac{\rho~s}{T}~\text{dV}.
    }
  &lt;/math&gt;
We can show that the entropy inequality may be written in differential form as
:&lt;math&gt;
    {
    \rho~\dot{\eta} \ge - \boldsymbol{\nabla} \cdot \left(\cfrac{\mathbf{q}}{T}\right)
       + \cfrac{\rho~s}{T}.
    }
  &lt;/math&gt;
In terms of the Cauchy stress and the internal energy, the Clausius&amp;ndash;Duhem inequality may be written as 
:&lt;math&gt;
    {
      \rho~(\dot{e} - T~\dot{\eta}) - \boldsymbol{\sigma}:\boldsymbol{\nabla}\mathbf{v} \le

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Declaration of Human Rights.jpg|thumb|right|The French [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]], whose principles still have constitutional value]]
'''Constitutional law''' is a body of law dealing with the distribution and exercise of [[government]] power.

Not all [[nation state]]s have codified [[constitution]]s, though all such states have a ''[[jus commune]]'', or law of the land, that may consist of a variety of imperative and consensual rules. These may include [[customary law]], [[Convention (norm)|conventions]], [[statutory law]], [[judge-made law]] or [[international law|international rules and norms]], and so on.

==Functions of constitutions==
===State and legal structure===
Constitutional laws may often be considered second order rulemaking or rules about making rules to exercise power. It governs the relationships between the judiciary, the legislature and the executive with the bodies under its authority. One of the key tasks of constitutions within this context is to indicate hierarchies and relationships of power. For example, in a [[unitary state]], the constitution will vest ultimate authority in one central administration and [[legislature]], and [[judiciary]], though there is often a delegation of power or authority to local or municipal authorities. When a constitution establishes a [[federal state]], it will identify the several levels of government coexisting with exclusive or shared areas of jurisdiction over lawmaking, application and enforcement.

===Human rights===
{{Main|Human rights|Human rights law}}
Human rights or [[civil liberties]] form a crucial part of a country's constitution and govern the rights of the individual against the state. Most jurisdictions, like the [[United States of America|United States]] and [[France]], have a codified constitution, with a [[bill of rights]]. A recent example is the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union]] which was intended to be included in the [[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe]], that failed to be ratified. Perhaps the most important example is the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] under the [[UN Charter]]. These are intended to ensure basic political, social and economic standards that a nation state, or intergovernmental body is obliged to provide to its citizens but many do include its governments.

Some countries like the [[United Kingdom]] have no entrenched document setting out fundamental rights; in those jurisdictions the constitution is composed of [[statute]], [[case law]] and [[Constitutional convention (political custom)|convention]]. A case named ''[[Entick v. Carrington]]''&lt;ref&gt;''[[Entick v. Carrington]]'' (1765) 19 Howell's State Trials 1030&lt;/ref&gt; il a constitutional principle deriving from the common law. [[John Entick]]'s house was searched and ransacked by Sherriff Carrington. Carrington argued that a warrant from a Government minister, the [[George Montague-Dunk, 2nd Earl of Halifax|Earl of Halifax]] was valid authority, even though there was no statutory provision or court order for it. The court, led by [[Charles Pratt, 1st Earl Camden|Lord Camden]] stated that,

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;The great end, for which men entered into society, was to secure their property. That right is preserved sacred and incommunicable in all instances, where it has not been taken away or abridged by some public law for the good of the whole. By the laws of England, every invasion of private property, be it ever so minute, is a trespass... If no excuse can be found or produced, the silence of the books is an authority against the defendant, and the plaintiff must have judgment.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.constitution.org/trials/entick/entick_v_carrington.htm | title=Entick v. Carrington | work=19 Howell’s State Trials 1029 (1765) | publisher=Constitution Society | location=[[United States|USA]] | accessdate=2008-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Inspired by [[Two Treatises of Government|John Locke]],&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 9, Line 124, [[John Locke]], ''[[Second Treatise on Government]]'' (1690)&lt;/ref&gt; the fundamental constitutional principle is that the individual can do anything but that which is forbidden by law, while the state may do nothing but that which is authorised by law.

The commonwealth and the civil law jurisdictions do not share the same constitutional law underpinnings.

===Legislative procedure===
{{Main|Parliamentary procedure}}
Another main function of constitutions may be to describe the procedure by which parliaments may legislate. For instance, special majorities may be required to alter the constitution. In bicameral legislatures, there may be a process laid out for second or third readings of bills before a new law can enter into force. Alternatively, there may further be requirements for maximum terms that a government can keep power before holding an [[election]].

==Study of constitutional law==
{{Globalize|date=December 2010}}
Constitutional law is a major focus of legal studies and research. For example, most law students in the United States are required to take a class in Constitutional Law during their first year, and several [[law journals]] are devoted to the discussion of constitutional issues.

== The Rule of Law ==
The doctrine of the rule of law dictates that government must be conducted according to law.

Dicey identified three essential elements of the British Constitution which were indicative of the rule of law:
#Absence of arbitrary power;
#Equality before the law;
#The Constitution is a result of the ordinary law of the land.

== The Separation of Powers ==
Often regarded as a second limb functioning alongside the Rule of Law to curb the powers of the Government. 
In most modern nation states, power is divided and vested into three branches of government: The Executive, the Legislature and the Judiciary. The first and the second are harmonized in traditional Westminster forms of government.

The '''Celtic languages''' ([[Pronunciation of Celtic|pronounced]] {{IPA|/ˈkɛltɪk/}} or {{IPA|/ˈsɛltɪk/}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/celtic American Heritage Dictionary. Celtic: kel-tik, sel-]&lt;/ref&gt;) are descended from [[Proto-Celtic]], or &quot;Common Celtic&quot;; a branch of the greater [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] [[language family]]. The term &quot;Celtic&quot; was first used to describe this language group by [[Edward Lhuyd]] in 1707.&lt;ref&gt;Cunliffe, Barry W. 2003. The Celts: a very short introduction. P.48&lt;/ref&gt;

Celtic languages are most commonly spoken on the western fringe of [[Europe]], notably in [[Ireland]], [[Scotland]], [[Wales]], the peninsula of [[Brittany]] in [[France]], [[Cornwall]], and the [[Isle of Man]], and can be found spoken on [[Cape Breton Island]] (Canada) and in [[Patagonia]] (Argentina and Chile). Some people speak Celtic languages in the other Celtic diaspora areas of the United States,&lt;ref name=&quot;mla&quot;&gt;[http://www.mla.org/map_data_states&amp;mode=lang_tops&amp;lang_id=636 &quot;Language by State - Scottish Gaelic&quot;] on ''Modern Language Association'' website. Retrieved 27 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Canada, Australia,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.omi.wa.gov.au/WAPeople%5CSect1%5CTable%201p04%20Aust.pdf &quot;Languages Spoken At Home&quot;] from Australian Government ''Office of Multicultural Interests'' website. Retrieved 27 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://google.com/search?q=cache:nyn-HP5XEWUJ:www.stats.govt.nz/NR/rdonlyres/1C81F07B-28C6-4DDD-8EBA-80C592E8022A/0/20languagespokentotalresponse.xls+scottish+gaelic+new+zealand+census&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=1&amp;gl=uk Languages Spoken:Total Responses] from Statistics New Zealand website. Retrieved 5 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In all these areas, the Celtic languages are now only spoken by minorities though there are continuing efforts at revival.

During the 1st millennium BCE, they were spoken across Europe, from the [[Bay of Biscay]] and the [[North Sea]], up the [[Rhine]] and down the [[Danube]] to the [[Black Sea]] and the [[Balkans|Upper Balkan Peninsula]], and into [[Asia Minor]] ([[Galatia]]).
The spread to Cape Breton and Patagonia occurred in modern times. Celtic languages were spoken in Australia before federation in 1901.

==Living dialects==
[[SIL Ethnologue]] lists six &quot;living&quot; Celtic languages, of which four have retained a substantial number of native speakers. These are [[Welsh language|Welsh]] and [[Breton language|Breton]], descended from the [[British language (Celtic)|British language]], and [[Irish language|Irish]] and [[Scottish Gaelic]], descended from [[Old Irish]].

The other two, [[Cornish language|Cornish]] and [[Manx language|Manx]], were spoken into modern times but later died as spoken community languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Koch|first= John T.|coauthors= |title= Celtic Culture: A Historical Encyclopedia| publisher= ABC-CLIO|year= 2006|month= |pages=34, 365–366, 529, 973, 1053|url=http://books.google.com.au/books?id=f899xH_quaMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Celtic+Culture:+A+Historical+Encyclopedia&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=p_YAf9AxXK&amp;sig=GoBU0DW1RAo3_2SQW3PFMICrA5A&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=0nAXTI6LCJKekQWM6KWcCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate= June 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A brief history of the Cornish language|url=http://www.magakernow.org.uk/index.aspx?articleid=38590#Revival|publisher=Maga Kernow}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Beresford Ellis|first=Peter|title=The Story of the Cornish Language|year=1990, 1998, 2005|publisher=Tor Mark Press|isbn=0-85025-371-3|pages=20–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; For both these languages, however, [[Language revitalization|revitalization]] movements have led to the adoption of these languages by adults and children and produced some native speakers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iomtoday.co.im/manx-language/Fockle-ny-ghaa-schoolchildren-take.3901786.jp Fockle ny ghaa: schoolchildren take charge]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='South West:TeachingEnglish:British Council:BBC|url=http://www.teachingenglish.org.uk/uk-languages/south-west|accessdate=2010-02-09|publisher=[[BBC]]|year=2010|work=BBC/British Council website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taken together, there were roughly one million native speakers of Celtic languages as of the [[2000s (decade)|2000s]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_family.asp?subid=1164-16| title=Celtic Languages| publisher=Ethnologue| accessdate=9 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classifications==
[[File:IndoEuropeanTree.svg|thumb|Classification of Indo-European languages. ''(click to enlarge)'']]
Proto-Celtic divided into four sub-families:

*[[Gaulish language|Gaulish]] and its close relatives [[Lepontic]], [[Noric language|Noric]], and [[Galatian language|Galatian]]. These languages were once spoken in a wide arc from [[France]] to [[Turkey]] and from [[Belgium]] to northern [[Italy]]. They are now all extinct.
*[[Celtiberian language|Celtiberian]], anciently spoken in the [[Iberian peninsula]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arkeotavira.com/Mapas/Iberia/Populi.htm Ethnographic Map of Pre-Roman Iberia (circa 200 B.C.)]&lt;/ref&gt; in parts of modern [[Aragón]], [[Old Castile]], and [[New Castile (Spain)|New Castile]] in [[Spain]]. [[Lusitanian language|Lusitanian]], from Southern [[Portugal]], may also have been a Celtic language.  These are now also extinct.
*[[Goidelic languages|Goidelic]], including [[Irish language|Irish]], [[Scottish Gaelic language|Scottish Gaelic]], and [[Manx language|Manx]]. At one time there were Irish on the coast of southwest England and on the coast of north and south Wales.
*[[Brythonic languages|Brythonic]], including [[Welsh language|Welsh]], [[Breton language|Breton]], [[Cornish language|Cornish]], [[Cumbric language|Cumbric]], and possibly also [[Pictish language|Pictish]] though this may be a sister language rather than a daughter of [[British language (Celtic)|British]] (Common Brythonic).&lt;ref&gt;[[Kenneth H. Jackson]] suggested that there were two Pictish languages, a pre-Indo-European one and a ''Pretenic'' Celtic one. This has been challenged by some scholars. See Katherine Forsyth's ''&quot;Language in Pictland: the case against 'non-Indo-European Pictish'&quot; '' {{PDFlink|[http://eprints.gla.ac.uk/archive/00002081/01/languagepictland.pdf Etext]|27.8&amp;nbsp;[[Megabyte|MB]]&lt;!-- application/pdf, 29250501 bytes --&gt;}}. See also the introduction by James &amp; Taylor to the ''&quot;Index of Celtic and Other Elements in W.J.Watson's 'The History of the Celtic Place-names of Scotland'&quot;'' {{PDFlink|[http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/institutes/sassi/spns/INDEX2INTRO.pdf Etext]|172&amp;nbsp;[[Kilobyte|KB]]&lt;!-- application/pdf, 176743 bytes --&gt;}}. Compare also the treatment of Pictish in Price's ''The Languages of Britain'' (1984) with his ''Languages in Britain &amp; Ireland'' (2000).&lt;/ref&gt; Before the arrival of Scotti on the Isle of Man in the 9th century there may have been a Brythonic language in the Isle of Man&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Jackson used the term &quot;Brittonic&quot; for the form of the British language after the changes in the 6th century.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholarly handling of the Celtic languages has been rather argumentative owing to lack of much primary source data. Some scholars (such as Cowgill 1975; McCone 1991, 1992; and Schrijver 1995) distinguish [[Continental Celtic languages|Continental Celtic]] and [[Insular Celtic languages|Insular Celtic]], arguing that the differences between the Goidelic and Brythonic languages arose after these split off from the Continental Celtic languages. Other scholars (such as Schmidt 1988) distinguish between [[P-Celtic and Q-Celtic]], putting most of the Gaulish and Brythonic languages in the former group and the Goidelic and Celtiberian languages in the latter. The P-Celtic languages (also called [[Gallo-Brittonic]]) are sometimes seen (for example by Koch 1992) as a central innovating area as opposed to the more conservative peripheral Q-Celtic languages.

The Breton language is Brythonic, not Gaulish, though there may be some input from the latter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Barbour and Carmichael|first=Stephen and Cathie |title=Language and nationalism in Europe|year=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=56|url=http://books.google.com/?id=1ixmu8Iga7gC&amp;pg=PA56&amp;lpg=PA56&amp;dq=Breton+Gaulish+words&amp;q=Breton%20Gaulish%20words|isbn=9780198236719}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the [[Anglo-Saxons]] moved into [[Great Britain]], several waves of the native [[Britons (historical)|Britons]] crossed the [[English Channel]] and landed in [[Brittany]]. They brought with them their Brythonic language, which evolved into Breton – still partially intelligible by modern Welsh and Cornish speakers.

In the P/Q classification scheme the first language to split off from Proto-Celtic was Gaelic. It has characteristics that some scholars see as archaic but others see as also being in the Brythonic languages (see Schmidt). With the Insular/Continental classification scheme the split of the former into Gaelic and Brythonic is seen as being late.

The distinction of Celtic into these four sub-families most likely occurred about 900 BC according to Gray and Atkinson&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1038/nature02029|last=Gray and Atkinson|first1=RD|last2=Atkinson|first2=QD|title=Language-tree divergence times support the Anatolian theory of Indo-European origin|journal=Nature|volume=426|issue=6965|pages=435–439|year=2003|pmid=14647380|bibcode=2003Natur.426..435G}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1096-0031.2003.tb00299.x|last=Rexova|first=K.|coauthors= Frynta, D and Zrzavy, J.|year=2003|title=Cladistic analysis of languages: Indo-European classification based on lexicostatistical data|journal=Cladistics|volume=19|issue=2|pages=120–127}}&lt;/ref&gt; but, because of estimation uncertainty, it could be any time between 1200 and 800 BC. However, they only considered Gaelic and Brythonic. The controversial paper by Forster and Toth&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Forster|first=Peter |coauthors=Toth, Alfred |year=2003|title=Toward a phylogenetic chronology of ancient Gaulish, Celtic, and Indo-European|publisher=The National Academy of Sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt; included Gaulish and put the break-up much earlier at 3200 BC ± 1500 years. They support the Insular Celtic hypothesis. The early Celts were commonly associated with the archaeological [[Urnfield culture]], the [[Hallstatt culture]], and the [[La Tène culture]], though the earlier assumption of association between language and culture is now considered to be less strong.

[[Image:Celtic Nations.svg|right|thumb|175px|The [[Celtic nations]] where most Celtic speakers are now concentrated]]
There are two main competing schemata of categorization. The older scheme, argued for by Schmidt (1988) among others, links Gaulish with Brythonic in a '''P-Celtic''' node, originally leaving just Goidelic as '''Q-Celtic'''. The difference between P and Q languages is the treatment of [[Proto-Celtic language|Proto-Celtic]] *''kʷ'', which became *''p'' in the P-Celtic languages but *''k'' in Goidelic. An example is the Proto-Celtic verb root *''kʷrin-'' &quot;to buy&quot;, which became ''pryn-'' in Welsh but ''cren-'' in [[Old Irish language|Old Irish]]. However, a classification based on a single feature is seen as risky by its critics, particularly as the sound change occurs in other language groups ([[Oscan language|Oscan]] and [[Greek language|Greek]]).

The other scheme, defended for example by McCone (1996), links Goidelic and Brythonic together as an [[Insular Celtic languages|Insular Celtic]] branch, while Gaulish and Celtiberian are referred to as [[Continental Celtic languages|Continental Celtic]]. According to this theory, the &quot;P-Celtic&quot; sound change of {{IPA|[kʷ]}} to {{IPA|[p]}} occurred independently or [[areal feature|areally]]. The proponents of the Insular Celtic hypothesis point to other shared innovations among Insular Celtic languages, including inflected prepositions, VSO word order, and the lenition of intervocalic {{IPA|[m]}} to {{IPA|[β̃]}}, a [[nasalization|nasalised]] [[voiced bilabial fricative]] (an extremely rare sound). There is, however, no assumption that the Continental Celtic languages descend from a common &quot;Proto-Continental Celtic&quot; ancestor. Rather, the Insular/Continental schemata usually considers Celtiberian the first branch to split from Proto-Celtic, and the remaining group would later have split into Gaulish and Insular Celtic.

There are legitimate scholarly arguments in favour of both the Insular Celtic hypothesis and the P-Celtic/Q-Celtic hypothesis. Proponents of each schema dispute the accuracy and usefulness of the other's categories. However, since the 1970s the division into Insular and Continental Celtic has become the more widely held view (Cowgill 1975; McCone 1991, 1992; Schrijver 1995), but in the middle of the 1980s, the P-Celtic/Q-Celtic hypothesis found new supporters (Lambert 1994), because of the inscription on the Larzac piece of lead (1983), the analysis of which reveals another common phonetical innovation ''-nm-'' &gt; ''-nu'' (Gaelic ''ainm'' / Gaulish ''anuana'', Old Welsh ''enuein'' &quot;names&quot;), that is less accidental than only one. The discovery of a third common innovation, would allow the specialists to come to the conclusion of a [[Gallo-Brythonic]] dialect (Schmidt 1986; Fleuriot 1986).

When referring only to the modern Celtic languages, since no Continental Celtic language has living descendants, &quot;Q-Celtic&quot; is equivalent to &quot;Goidelic&quot; and &quot;P-Celtic&quot; is equivalent to &quot;Brythonic&quot;.

Within the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] family, the Celtic languages have sometimes been placed with the [[Italic languages]] in a common [[Italo-Celtic]] subfamily, a hypothesis that is now largely discarded, in favour of the assumption of [[language contact]] between pre-Celtic and pre-Italic communities.

How the family tree of the Celtic languages is ordered depends on which hypothesis is used:

==Characteristics of Celtic languages==
{{Technical|date=March 2008}}
Although there are many differences between the individual Celtic languages, they do show many family resemblances. While none of these characteristics are necessarily unique to the Celtic languages, there are few if any other languages which possess them all. They include:

*[[consonant mutation]]s (Insular Celtic only)
*[[inflected preposition]]s (Insular Celtic only)
*two [[grammatical gender]]s (modern Insular Celtic only; Old Irish and the Continental languages had three genders)
*a [[vigesimal]] number system (counting by twenties)
**e.g. Cornish ''whetek ha dew ugens'' &quot;fifty-six&quot; (literally &quot;sixteen and two twenty&quot;)
*verb-subject-object (VSO) word order (probably Insular Celtic only)
*an interplay between the subjunctive, future, imperfect, and habitual, to the point that some tenses and moods have ousted others
*an impersonal or autonomous verb form serving as a passive or intransitive
**Welsh ''dysgaf'' &quot;I teach&quot; vs. ''dysgir'' &quot;is taught, one teaches&quot;, Irish &quot;déanaim&quot; &quot;I do/make&quot; vs. &quot;déantar&quot; &quot;is done&quot;
*no infinitives, replaced by a quasi-nominal verb form called the verbal noun or verbnoun
*frequent use of vowel mutation as a morphological device, e.g. formation of plurals, verbal stems, etc.
*use of preverbal particles to signal either subordination or illocutionary force of the following clause
**mutation-distinguished subordinators/relativisers
**particles for negation, interrogation, and occasionally for affirmative declarations
*infixed pronouns positioned between particles and verbs
*lack of simple verb for the imperfective &quot;have&quot; process, with possession conveyed by a composite structure, usually BE + preposition
**Cornish ''yma kath dhymm'' &quot;I have a cat&quot;, literally &quot;there is a cat to me&quot;
*use of periphrastic phrases to express verbal tense, voice, or aspectual distinctions
*distinction by function of the two versions of BE verbs traditionally labelled substantive (or existential) and [[Copula (linguistics)|copula]]
*bifurcated demonstrative structure
*suffixed pronominal supplements, called confirming or supplementary pronouns
*use of singulars and/or special forms of counted nouns, and use of a singulative suffix to make singular forms from plurals, where older singulars have disappeared

Examples:&lt;br&gt;
(Irish) ''Ná bac le mac an bhacaigh is ní bhacfaidh mac an bhacaigh leat.''&lt;br&gt;
(Literal translation) Don't bother with son the beggar's and not will-bother son the beggar's with-you.
*''bhacaigh'' is the genitive of ''bacach''. The ''igh'' the result of [[affection (linguistics)|affection]]; the ''bh'' is the [[lenition|lenited]] form of ''b''.
*''leat'' is the second person singular inflected form of the preposition ''le''.
*The order is verb subject object (VSO) in the second half - compare this to English or French (and possibly Continental Celtic) which are normally Subject Verb Object in word order.

(Welsh) ''pedwar ar bymtheg a phedwar ugain''&lt;br&gt;
(literally) four on fifteen and four twenties
*''bymtheg'' is a mutated form of ''pymtheg'', which is ''pump'' (&quot;five&quot;) plus ''deg'' (&quot;ten&quot;). Likewise, ''phedwar'' is a mutated form of ''pedwar''.
*The multiples of ten are ''deg, ugain, deg ar hugain, deugain, hanner cant, trigain, deg a thrigain, pedwar ugain, deg a phedwar ugain, cant''.

[[File:Colouring pencils.jpg|right|300px|thumb|Color]]
'''Color''' or '''colour''' (see [[American and British English spelling differences#-our, -or|spelling differences]]) is the [[visual perception|visual perceptual]] [[Physical property|property]] corresponding in [[humans]] to the categories called ''red'', ''green'', ''blue'' and others. Color derives from the [[spectrum of light]] (distribution of [[light]] energy versus [[wavelength]]) interacting in the eye with the spectral sensitivities of the [[photoreceptor cell|light receptor]]s. Color categories and physical specifications of color are also associated with objects, materials, light sources, etc., based on their physical properties such as light absorption, reflection, or emission spectra. By defining a [[color space]], colors can be identified numerically by their coordinates.

Because perception of color stems from the varying [[spectral sensitivity]] of different types of [[cone cells]] in the [[retina]] to different parts of the spectrum, colors may be defined and quantified by the degree to which they stimulate these cells. These physical or [[physiological]] quantifications of color, however, do not fully explain the [[psychophysical]] perception of color appearance.

The science of color is sometimes called '''''chromatics'''''. It includes the perception of color by the [[human eye]] and brain, the origin of color in materials, [[color theory]] in [[art]], and the [[physics]] of [[electromagnetic radiation]] in the visible range (that is, what we commonly refer to simply as ''[[light]]'').

[[Electromagnetic radiation]] is characterized by its [[wavelength]] (or [[frequency]]) and its [[intensity]]. When the wavelength is within the visible spectrum (the range of wavelengths humans can perceive, approximately from 390&amp;nbsp;[[nanometre|nm]] to 750&amp;nbsp;nm), it is known as &quot;visible light&quot;.

Most light sources emit light at many different wavelengths; a source's ''spectrum'' is a distribution giving its intensity at each wavelength. Although the spectrum of light arriving at the eye from a given direction determines the color [[Wikt:sensation|sensation]] in that direction, there are many more possible spectral combinations than color sensations. In fact, one may formally define a color as a class of spectra that give rise to the same color sensation, although such classes would vary widely among different species, and to a lesser extent among individuals within the same species. In each such class the members are called ''[[Metamerism (color)|metamers]]'' of the color in question.

=== Spectral colors ===
The familiar colors of the [[rainbow]] in the [[Optical spectrum|spectrum]] – named using the [[Latin]] word for ''appearance'' or ''apparition'' by [[Isaac Newton]] in 1671 – include all those colors that can be produced by [[visible light]] of a single wavelength only, the ''pure spectral'' or [[monochromatic color|''monochromatic'' colors]]. The table at right shows approximate frequencies (in [[hertz|terahertz]]) and wavelengths (in [[nanometre|nanometers]]) for various pure spectral colors. The wavelengths are measured in air or [[vacuum]] (see [[refraction]]).

The color table should not be interpreted as a definitive list – the pure spectral colors form a continuous [[spectrum]], and how it is divided into distinct colors [[language|linguistically]] is a matter of culture and historical contingency (although people everywhere have been shown to ''perceive'' colors in the same way&lt;ref&gt;[[Brent Berlin|Berlin, B.]] and [[Paul Kay|Kay, P.]], ''[[Basic Color Terms: Their Universality and Evolution]]'', Berkeley: [[University of California Press]], 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;). A common list identifies six main bands: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and violet. Newton's conception included a seventh color, [[indigo]], between blue and violet. Optical scientists Hardy and Perrin list indigo as between 446 and 464&amp;nbsp;nm wavelength.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur C. Hardy and Fred H. Perrin. ''[http://apps.isiknowledge.com/full_record.do?product=UA&amp;search_mode=GeneralSearch&amp;qid=22&amp;SID=2EdCK2KejLbni4FJpgB&amp;page=1&amp;doc=1&amp;colname=BIOSIS The Principles of Optics.]'' McGraw-Hill Book Co., Inc., New York. 1932.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''intensity'' of a spectral color, relative to the context in which it is viewed, may alter its perception considerably; for example, a low-intensity orange-yellow is [[brown]], and a low-intensity yellow-green is olive-green.

For discussion of non-spectral colors, see [[#Spectral colors and color reproduction|below]].

=== Color of objects ===

[[File:Optical grey squares orange brown.svg|right|thumb|250px|The upper disk and the lower disk have exactly the same objective color, and are in identical gray surroundings; based on context differences, humans perceive the squares as having different reflectances, and may interpret the colors as different color categories; see [[same color illusion]].]]

The color of an object depends on both the physics of the object in its environment and the characteristics of the perceiving eye and brain. Physically, objects can be said to have the color of the light leaving their surfaces, which normally depends on the spectrum of the incident illumination and the reflectance properties of the surface, as well as potentially on the angles of illumination and viewing. Some objects not only reflect light, but also transmit light or emit light themselves (see below), which contribute to the color also. And a viewer's perception of the object's color depends not only on the spectrum of the light leaving its surface, but also on a host of contextual cues, so that the color tends to be perceived as relatively constant: that is, relatively independent of the lighting spectrum, viewing angle, etc. This effect is known as [[color constancy]].

Some generalizations of the physics can be drawn, neglecting perceptual effects for now:
* Light arriving at an [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]] surface is either [[Reflection (physics)|reflect]]ed &quot;specularly&quot; (that is, in the manner of a mirror), [[scattering|scatter]]ed (that is, reflected with diffuse scattering), or [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorbed]] – or some combination of these.
* Opaque objects that do not reflect specularly (which tend to have rough surfaces) have their color determined by which wavelengths of light they scatter more and which they scatter less (with the light that is not scattered being absorbed). If objects scatter all wavelengths, they appear white. If they absorb all wavelengths, they appear black.
* Opaque objects that specularly reflect light of different wavelengths with different efficiencies look like mirrors tinted with colors determined by those differences. An object that reflects some fraction of impinging light and absorbs the rest may look black but also be faintly reflective; examples are black objects coated with layers of enamel or lacquer.
* Objects that transmit light are either ''translucent'' (scattering the transmitted light) or ''transparent'' (not scattering the transmitted light). If they also absorb (or reflect) light of varying wavelengths differentially, they appear tinted with a color determined by the nature of that absorption (or that reflectance).
* Objects may emit light that they generate themselves, rather than merely reflecting or transmitting light. They may do so because of their elevated temperature (they are then said to be ''[[incandescence|incandescent]]''), as a result of certain chemical reactions (a phenomenon called ''[[chemoluminescence]]''), or for other reasons (see the articles [[Phosphorescence]] and [[List of light sources]]).
* Objects may absorb light and then as a consequence emit light that has different properties. They are then called ''[[fluorescence|fluorescent]]'' (if light is emitted only while light is absorbed) or ''phosphorescent'' (if light is emitted even after light ceases to be absorbed; this term is also sometimes loosely applied to light emitted because of chemical reactions).

For further treatment of the color of objects, see [[#Structural color|structural color]], below.

To summarize, the color of an object is a complex result of its surface properties, its transmission properties, and its emission properties, all of which factors contribute to the mix of wavelengths in the light leaving the surface of the object. The perceived color is then further conditioned by the nature of the ambient illumination, and by the color properties of other objects nearby, via the effect known as [[color constancy]] and via other characteristics of the perceiving eye and brain.

=== Development of theories of color vision ===
{{main|Color theory}}

Although [[Aristotle]] and other ancient scientists had already written on the nature of light and [[color vision]], it was not until [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] that light was identified as the source of the color sensation. In 1810, [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]] published his comprehensive ''[[Theory of Colours|Theory of Colors]]''. In 1801 [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]] proposed his [[trichromatic color vision|trichromatic theory]], based on the observation that any color could be matched with a combination of three lights. This theory was later refined by [[James Clerk Maxwell]] and [[Hermann von Helmholtz]]. As Helmholtz puts it, &quot;the principles of Newton's law of mixture were experimentally confirmed by Maxwell in 1856. Young's theory of color sensations, like so much else that this marvellous investigator achieved in advance of his time, remained unnoticed until Maxwell directed attention to it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hermann von Helmholtz, ''Physiological Optics – The Sensations of Vision'', 1866, as translated in ''Sources of Color Science'', David L. MacAdam, ed., Cambridge: [[MIT Press]], 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time as Helmholtz, [[Ewald Hering]] developed the [[opponent process]] theory of color, noting that [[color blindness]] and afterimages typically come in opponent pairs (red-green, blue-orange, yellow-purple, and black-white). Ultimately these two theories were synthesized in 1957 by Hurvich and Jameson, who showed that retinal processing corresponds to the trichromatic theory, while processing at the level of the [[lateral geniculate nucleus]] corresponds to the opponent theory.&lt;ref name =&quot;Palmer99&quot;&gt;Palmer, S.E. (1999). ''Vision Science: Photons to Phenomenology'', Cambridge, MA: MIT Press. ISBN 0-262-16183-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1931, an international group of experts known as the ''Commission internationale de l'éclairage'' ([[International Commission on Illumination|CIE]]) developed a mathematical color model, which mapped out the space of observable colors and assigned a set of three numbers to each.

=== Color in the eye ===
{{main|Color vision}}

[[File:1Mcolors.png|thumb|This image (when viewed in full size, 1000 pixels wide) contains 1 million pixels, each of a different color. The [[human eye]] can distinguish about 10 million different colors.&lt;ref name=&quot;business&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first=Deane B.|last=Judd|coauthors=Wyszecki, Günter|title=Color in Business, Science and Industry|publisher=[[Wiley-Interscience]]|series=Wiley Series in Pure and Applied Optics|edition=third|location=New York|year= 1975|page=388|isbn=0471452122}}&lt;/ref&gt;
]]

The ability of the [[human eye]] to distinguish colors is based upon the varying sensitivity of different cells in the [[retina]] to light of different wavelengths. Humans being [[Trichromacy|trichromatic]], the retina contains three types of color receptor cells, or [[cone cell|cones]]. One type, relatively distinct from the other two, is most responsive to light that we perceive as violet, with wavelengths around 420 [[nanometre|nm]]; cones of this type are sometimes called ''short-wavelength cones'', ''S cones'', or ''blue cones''. The other two types are closely related genetically and chemically. One of them, sometimes called ''long-wavelength cones'', ''L cones'', or ''red cones'', is most sensitive to light we perceive as greenish yellow, with wavelengths around 564&amp;nbsp;nm; the other type, known as ''middle-wavelength cones'', ''M cones'', or ''green cones'' is most sensitive to light perceived as green, with wavelengths around 534&amp;nbsp;nm.

Light, no matter how complex its composition of wavelengths, is reduced to three color components by the eye. For each location in the visual field, the three types of cones yield three signals based on the extent to which each is stimulated. These amounts of stimulation are sometimes called ''tristimulus values''.

The response curve as a function of wavelength for each type of cone is illustrated above. Because the curves overlap, some tristimulus values do not occur for any incoming light combination. For example, it is not possible to stimulate ''only'' the mid-wavelength (so-called &quot;green&quot;) cones; the other cones will inevitably be stimulated to some degree at the same time. The set of all possible tristimulus values determines the human ''color space''. It has been estimated that humans can distinguish roughly 10 million different colors.&lt;ref name=&quot;business&quot; /&gt;

The other type of light-sensitive cell in the eye, the [[rod cell|rod]], has a different response curve. In normal situations, when light is bright enough to strongly stimulate the cones, rods play virtually no role in vision at all.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Under well-lit viewing conditions (photopic vision), cones&amp;nbsp; ...are highly active and rods are inactive.&quot; {{cite conference|last=Hirakawa|first=K.|coauthors=Parks, T.W. |title=Chromatic Adaptation and White-Balance Problem |conference=IEEE ICIP |year=2005|doi=10.1109/ICIP.2005.1530559|url=http://www.accidentalmark.com/research/papers/Hirakawa05WBICIP.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, in dim light, the cones are understimulated leaving only the signal from the rods, resulting in a [[colorless]] response. (Furthermore, the rods are barely sensitive to light in the &quot;red&quot; range.) In certain conditions of intermediate illumination, the rod response and a weak cone response can together result in color discriminations not accounted for by cone responses alone. These effects, combined, are summarized also in the [[Kruithof curve]], that describes the change of color perception and pleasingness of light as function of temperature and intensity.

=== Color in the brain ===
{{main|Color vision}}

[[File:Ventral-dorsal streams.svg|thumb|right|300px|The visual [[dorsal stream]] (green) and [[ventral stream]] (purple) are shown. The ventral stream is responsible for color perception.]]

While the mechanisms of color vision at the level of the retina are well-described in terms of tristimulus values (see above), color processing after that point is organized differently. A dominant theory of color vision proposes that color information is transmitted out of the eye by three [[opponent processes]], or opponent channels, each constructed from the raw output of the cones: a red-green channel, a blue-yellow channel and a black-white &quot;luminance&quot; channel. This theory has been supported by neurobiology, and accounts for the structure of our subjective color experience. Specifically, it explains why we cannot perceive a &quot;reddish green&quot; or &quot;yellowish blue,&quot; and it predicts the [[color wheel]]: it is the collection of colors for which at least one of the two color channels measures a value at one of its extremes.

The exact nature of color perception beyond the processing already described, and indeed the status of color as a feature of the perceived world or rather as a feature of our ''perception'' of the world, is a matter of complex and continuing philosophical dispute (see [[qualia]]).

=== Nonstandard color perception ===
==== Color deficiency ====
{{main|Color blindness}}

If one or more types of a person's color-sensing cones are missing or less responsive than normal to incoming light, that person can distinguish fewer colors and is said to be ''color deficient'' or ''[[color blindness|color blind]]'' (though this latter term can be misleading; almost all color deficient individuals can distinguish at least some colors). Some kinds of color deficiency are caused by anomalies in the number or nature of cones in the retina. Others (like ''central'' or ''cortical'' ''[[achromatopsia]]'') are caused by neural anomalies in those parts of the brain where visual processing takes place.

==== Tetrachromacy ====
{{main|Tetrachromacy}}

While most humans are ''trichromatic'' (having three types of color receptors), many animals, known as ''[[tetrachromat]]s'', have four types. These include some species of [[spiders]], most [[marsupials]], [[birds]], [[reptiles]], and many species of [[fish]]. Other species are sensitive to only two axes of color or do not perceive color at all; these are called ''dichromats'' and ''monochromats'' respectively. A distinction is made between ''retinal tetrachromacy'' (having four pigments in cone cells in the retina, compared to three in trichromats) and ''functional tetrachromacy'' (having the ability to make enhanced color discriminations based on that retinal difference). As many as half of all women are retinal tetrachromats.&lt;ref name=Jameson/&gt; The phenomenon arises when an individual receives two slightly different copies of the gene for either the medium- or long-wavelength cones, which are carried on the x-chromosome. To have two different genes, a person must have two x-chromosomes, which is why the phenomenon only occurs in women.&lt;ref name=Jameson/&gt; For some of these retinal tetrachromats, color discriminations are enhanced, making them functional tetrachromats.&lt;ref name=Jameson&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jameson, K. A., Highnote, S. M., &amp; Wasserman, L. M. |year=2001 |title=Richer color experience in observers with multiple photopigment opsin genes.  | doi = 10.1038/351652a0|journal=Psychonomic Bulletin and Review |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=244–261 |url=http://www.klab.caltech.edu/cns186/papers/Jameson01.pdf |format=PDF |pmid=1904993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Synesthesia ====

In certain forms of [[synesthesia]], perceiving letters and numbers ([[grapheme-color synesthesia|grapheme–color synesthesia]]) or hearing musical sounds (music–color synesthesia) will lead to the unusual additional experiences of seeing colors. Behavioral and [[functional neuroimaging]] experiments have demonstrated that these color experiences lead to changes in behavioral tasks and lead to increased activation of brain regions involved in color perception, thus demonstrating their reality, and similarity to real color percepts, albeit evoked through a non-standard route.

=== Afterimages ===

After exposure to strong light in their sensitivity range, [[Photoreceptor cell|photoreceptor]]s of a given type become desensitized. For a few seconds after the light ceases, they will continue to signal less strongly than they otherwise would. Colors observed during that period will appear to lack the color component detected by the desensitized photoreceptors. This effect is responsible for the phenomenon of afterimages, in which the eye may continue to see a bright figure after looking away from it, but in a [[complementary color]].

Afterimage effects have also been utilized by artists, including [[Vincent van Gogh]].

=== Color constancy ===
{{main|Color constancy}}

There is an interesting phenomenon which occurs when an artist uses a limited [[color palette]]: the [[Human eye|eye]] tends to compensate by seeing any grey or neutral color as the color which is missing from the color wheel. For example,  in a limited palette consisting of red, yellow, black and white, a mixture of yellow and black will appear as a variety of green, a mixture of red and black will appear as a variety of purple, and pure grey will appear bluish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Depauw|first=Robert C.|title=United States Patent|url=http://www.google.com/patents?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;vid=USPAT3815265&amp;id=tSEzAAAAEBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;dq=mixing+paint+colors&amp;printsec=abstract#v=onepage&amp;q=mixing%20paint%20colors&amp;f=false|accessdate=20 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- not due to black pigment being dark blue therefore reflecting more blue light? This is a real physical phenomenon and not a perceptual one. Is this paragraph not irrelevant to color constancy? --&gt;

The trichromatic theory discussed above is strictly true only if the whole scene seen by the eye is of one and the same color which, of course, is unrealistic. In reality, the brain compares the various colors in a scene to eliminate the effects of the illumination. If a scene is illuminated with one light, and then with another, as long as the difference between the light sources stays within a reasonable range, the colors in the scene appear constant to us. This was studied by [[Edwin Land]] in the 1970s and led to his retinex theory of [[color constancy]].

=== Color naming ===
{{main|Color term}}

Colors vary in several different ways, including [[hue]] (red vs. orange vs. blue), [[saturation (color theory)|saturation]], [[brightness]], and [[Gloss (material appearance)|gloss]]. Some color words are derived from the name of an object of that color, such as &quot;[[Orange (fruit)|orange]]&quot; or &quot;[[salmon]]&quot;, while others are abstract, like &quot;red&quot;.

Different cultures have different terms for colors, and may also assign some [[color name]]s to slightly different parts of the spectrum: for instance, the [[Chinese character]] 青 (rendered as ''qīng'' in [[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin]] and ''[[Ao (color)|ao]]'' in [[Japanese language|Japanese]]) has a meaning that covers both [[Distinguishing blue from green in language|blue and green]]; blue and green are traditionally considered shades of &quot;青.&quot; [[South Korea]], on the other hand, differentiates between blue and green by using &quot;綠 (녹)&quot; for green and &quot;靑 (청)&quot; for blue.

In the 1969 study [[Basic Color Terms: Their Universality and Evolution]], [[Brent Berlin]] and [[Paul Kay]] describe a pattern in naming &quot;basic&quot; colors (like &quot;red&quot; but not &quot;red-orange&quot; or &quot;dark red&quot; or &quot;blood red&quot;, which are &quot;shades&quot; of red). All languages that have two &quot;basic&quot; color names distinguish dark/cool colors from bright/warm colors. The next colors to be distinguished are usually red and then yellow or green. All languages with six &quot;basic&quot; colors include black, white, red, green, blue and yellow. The pattern holds up to a set of twelve: black, grey, white, pink, red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, brown, and [[azure (color)|azure]] (distinct from blue in [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Italian language|Italian]] but not English).

== Associations ==

Individual colors have a variety of cultural associations such as [[national colors]] (in general described in individual color articles and [[color symbolism]]). The field of [[color psychology]] attempts to identify the effects of color on human emotion and activity. [[Chromotherapy]] is a form of [[alternative medicine]] attributed to various Eastern traditions. Colors have different associations in different countries and cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalization-group.com/edge/resources/color-meanings-by-culture/|title= Chart: Color Meanings by Culture|accessdate=2010-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Different colors have been demonstrated to have affects on cognition. For example, researchers at the University of Linz in Austria demonstrated that the color red significantly decreases cognitive functioning in men.&lt;ref&gt;Gnambs, Timo; Appel, Markus; Batinic, Bernad. (2010). Color red in web-based knowledge testing. ''Computers in Human Behavior,'' 26, p1625-1631.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Spectral colors and color reproduction==

[[File:CIExy1931 fixed.svg|right|thumb|250px|The [[CIE 1931 color space]] [[chromaticity diagram]]. The outer curved boundary is the spectral (or monochromatic) locus, with wavelengths shown in nanometers. Note that the colors depicted depend on the [[color space]] of the device on which you are viewing the image, and therefore may not be a strictly accurate representation of the color at a particular position, and especially not for monochromatic colors.]]

Most light sources are mixtures of various wavelengths of light. However, many such sources can still have a spectral color insofar as the eye cannot distinguish them from monochromatic sources. For example, most computer displays reproduce the spectral color orange as a combination of red and green light; it appears orange because the red and green are mixed in the right proportions to allow the eye's red and green cones to respond the way they do to orange.

A useful concept in understanding the perceived color of a non-monochromatic light source is the [[dominant wavelength]], which identifies the single wavelength of light that produces a sensation most similar to the light source. Dominant wavelength is roughly akin to [[hue]].

There are many color perceptions that by definition cannot be pure spectral colors due to [[Saturation (color theory)|desaturation]] or because they are [[purple]]s (mixtures of red and violet light, from opposite ends of the spectrum). Some examples of necessarily non-spectral colors are the achromatic colors (black, gray and white) and colors such as [[pink]], tan, and [[magenta]].

Two different light spectra that have the same effect on the three color receptors in the [[human eye]] will be perceived as the same color. This is exemplified by the white light emitted by fluorescent lamps, which typically has a spectrum of a few narrow bands, while daylight has a continuous spectrum. The [[human eye]] cannot tell the difference between such light spectra just by looking into the light source, although reflected colors from objects can look different. (This is often exploited e.g., to make [[fruit]] or [[tomato]]es look more intensely red.)

Similarly, most human color perceptions can be generated by a mixture of three colors called ''primaries''. This is used to reproduce color scenes in photography, printing, television and other media. There are a number of methods or [[color space]]s for specifying a color in terms of three particular primary colors. Each method has its advantages and disadvantages depending on the particular application.

No mixture of colors, though, can produce a fully pure color perceived as completely identical to a spectral color, although one can get very close for the longer wavelengths, where the [[CIE 1931 color space|chromaticity diagram]] above has a nearly straight edge. For example, mixing green light (530&amp;nbsp;nm) and blue light (460&amp;nbsp;nm) produces cyan light that is slightly desaturated, because response of the red color receptor would be greater to the green and blue light in the mixture than it would be to a pure cyan light at 485&amp;nbsp;nm that has the same intensity as the mixture of blue and green.

Because of this, and because the ''primaries'' in [[color printing]] systems generally are not pure themselves, the colors reproduced are never perfectly saturated colors, and so spectral colors cannot be matched exactly. However, natural scenes rarely contain fully saturated colors, thus such scenes can usually be approximated well by these systems. The range of colors that can be reproduced with a given color reproduction system is called the [[gamut]]. The [[International Commission on Illumination|CIE]] chromaticity diagram can be used to describe the gamut.

Another problem with color reproduction systems is connected with the acquisition devices, like cameras or scanners. The characteristics of the color sensors in the devices are often very far from the characteristics of the receptors in the [[human eye]]. In effect, acquisition of colors that have some special, often very &quot;jagged,&quot; spectra caused for example by unusual lighting of the photographed scene can be relatively poor.

Species that have color receptors different from humans, e.g. [[bird]]s that may have four receptors, can differentiate some colors that look the same to a human. In such cases, a color reproduction system 'tuned' to a human with normal color vision may give very inaccurate results for the other observers.

The different color response of different devices can be problematic if not properly managed. For color information stored and transferred in digital form, [[color management]] techniques, such as those based on [[ICC profile]]s, can help to avoid distortions of the reproduced colors. Color management does not circumvent the [[gamut]] limitations of particular output devices, but can assist in finding good mapping of input colors into the gamut that can be reproduced.

== Pigments and reflective media ==

{{main|Pigment}}

Pigments are chemicals that selectively absorb and reflect different spectra of light. When a surface is painted with a pigment, light hitting the surface is reflected, minus some wavelengths. This subtraction of wavelengths produces the appearance of different colors. Most paints are a blend of several chemical pigments, intended to produce a reflection of a given color.

Pigment manufacturers assume the source light will be [[white]], or of roughly equal intensity across the spectrum. If the light is not a pure white source (as in the case of nearly all forms of artificial lighting), the resulting spectrum will appear a slightly different color. [[Red]] paint, viewed under [[blue]] light, may appear [[black]]. Red paint is red because it reflects only the red components of the spectrum. Blue light, containing none of these, will create no reflection from red paint, creating the appearance of black.

== Structural color ==

Structural colors are colors caused by interference effects rather than by pigments. Color effects are produced when a material is scored with fine parallel lines, formed of one or more parallel thin layers, or otherwise composed of microstructures on the scale of the color's [[wavelength]]. If the microstructures are spaced randomly, light of shorter wavelengths will be scattered preferentially to produce [[Tyndall effect]] colors: the blue of the sky (Rayleigh scattering, caused by structures much smaller than the wavelength of light, in this case air molecules), the luster of [[opal]]s, and the blue of human irises. If the microstructures are aligned in arrays, for example the array of pits in a CD, they behave as a [[diffraction grating]]: the grating reflects different wavelengths in different directions due to [[interference]] phenomena, separating mixed &quot;white&quot; light into light of different wavelengths. If the structure is one or more thin layers then it will reflect some wavelengths and transmit others, depending on the layers' thickness.

Structural color is studied in the field of [[thin-film optics]]. A layman's term that describes particularly the most ordered or the most changeable structural colors is [[iridescence]]. Structural color is responsible for the blues and greens of the feathers of many birds (the blue jay, for example), as well as certain butterfly wings and beetle shells. Variations in the pattern's spacing often give rise to an iridescent effect, as seen in [[peacock]] feathers, [[soap bubbles]], films of oil, and [[mother of pearl]], because the reflected color depends upon the viewing angle. Numerous scientists have carried out research in butterfly wings and beetle shells, including Isaac Newton and Robert Hooke. Since 1942, [[Electron microscope|electron micrography]] has been used, advancing the development of products that exploit structural color, such as &quot;[[photonic]]&quot; cosmetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esrc.ac.uk/ESRCInfoCentre/about/CI/events/FSS/2006/science.aspx?ComponentId=14867&amp;SourcePageId=14865|title= Economic and Social Research Council - Science in the Dock, Art in the Stocks|accessdate=2007-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Unreferenced|date=May 2011}}'''Computation''' is a general term for any type of [[information processing|process]], [[algorithm]] or [[measurement]]; this often includes but is not limited to digital data. This includes phenomena ranging from human thinking to calculations with a more narrow meaning. Computation is a process following a well-defined [[Model (abstract)|model]] that is understood and can be expressed in an [[algorithm]], [[Protocol (computing)|protocol]], [[network topology]], etc. Computation is also a major subject matter of [[computer science]]: it investigates what can or cannot be done in a computational manner.

{{Wiktionary|computation}}

== Classes of computation ==
Computation can be classified by at least three orthogonal criteria: [[digital]] vs [[analog electronics|analog]], [[sequential]] vs [[parallel computation|parallel]] vs [[Concurrency (computer science)|concurrent]], [[batch processing|batch]] vs [[interactive computation|interactive]].

In practice, digital computation is often used to simulate natural processes (for example,
[[Evolutionary computation]]), including those that are more naturally described by analog models of computation (for example, [[Artificial neural network]]).

== Computations as a physical phenomenon ==
A computation can be seen as a purely physical phenomenon occurring inside a closed [[physical system]] called a [[computer]].
Examples of such physical systems include [[digital computer]]s, [[mechanical computer]]s, [[quantum computer]]s, [[DNA computer]]s, [[molecular computer]]s, [[analog computer]]s or [[wetware computer]]s.
This point of view is the one adopted by the branch of theoretical physics called the [[physics of computation]].

An even more radical point of view is the postulate of [[digital physics]] that the evolution of the universe itself is a computation - Pancomputationalism.

== Mathematical models of computation ==
In the [[theory of computation]], a diversity of mathematical models of computers have been developed.
Typical mathematical [[Model of computation|models of computers]] are the following:
* State models including [[Turing Machine]], [[push-down automaton]], [[finite state automaton]], and [[PRAM]]
* Functional models including [[lambda calculus]]
* Logical models including [[logic programming]]
* Concurrent models including [[actor model]] and [[process calculi]]

== History ==
The word computation has an archaic meaning (from its [[Latin language|Latin]] etymological roots), but the word has come back in use with the arising of a new scientific discipline: [[computer science]].

'''Clowns''' are comic performers stereotypically characterized by the grotesque image of the [[circus clown]]'s colored wigs, stylistic makeup, outlandish costumes, unusually large footwear, and red nose, which evolved to project their actions to large audiences. Other less grotesque st
