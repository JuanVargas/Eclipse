{{Royal Navy}}

The '''Admiralty''' was formerly the authority in the [[Kingdom of England]], and later in the [[United Kingdom]], responsible for the command of the [[Royal Navy]]. Originally exercised by a single person, the office of Lord High Admiral was from the 18th Century onward almost invariably put &quot;in commission&quot;, and was exercised by the [[Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty]], who sat on the Board of Admiralty.

In 1964 the functions of the Admiralty were transferred to a new [[Admiralty Board (United Kingdom)|Admiralty Board]], which is a committee of the tri-service [[Defence Council of the United Kingdom]] and part of the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]]. The new Admiralty Board meets only twice a year, and the day-to-day running of the Royal Navy is controlled by a [[Navy Board]] (not to be confused with the historical Navy Board described later in this article). It is not uncommon for the various authorities now in charge of the Royal Navy to be referred to simply as ''The Admiralty''.

The title of Lord High Admiral of the United Kingdom is now vested in the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|Sovereign]]. However, there continues to be a [[Vice-Admiral of the United Kingdom]] and a [[Rear-Admiral of the United Kingdom]], both of which are honorary offices.

==Function and organisation==
===History===
[[Image:Flag of the Lord High Admiral of the United Kingdom.svg|thumb|left|Flag of the Lord High Admiral]]
The office of ''Admiral of England'' (or ''Lord Admiral'' and later ''Lord High Admiral'') was created around 1400, though there were before this Admirals of the Northern and Western Seas. In 1546 King [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] established the Council of the Marine, later to become the [[Navy Board]], to oversee administrative affairs of the naval service. Operational control of the Navy remained the responsibility of the Lord High Admiral, who was one of the nine [[Great Officers of State]].

In 1628, [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] put the office of Lord High Admiral into commission and control of the Royal Navy passed to a committee in the form of the Board of Admiralty. The office of Lord High Admiral passed a number of times in and out of commission until 1709, after which the office was almost permanently in commission (the last Lord High Admiral being the future [[William IV of the United Kingdom|King William IV]] in the early 19th century).

In 1831 the Navy Board was abolished as a separate entity and its duties and responsibilities were given over to the Admiralty.

In 1964 the Admiralty was subsumed into the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] along with the [[War Office]] and the [[Air Ministry]]. Within the expanded Ministry of Defence are the new ''Admiralty Board'', ''Army Board'' and ''Air Force Board'', each headed by the [[Secretary of State for Defence]]. As mentioned above, there is also a new Navy Board in charge of the day-to-day running of the Royal Navy.

===The Board of Admiralty===

[[File:Board Room of Admiralty Microcosm edited.jpg|thumb|right|Board of admiralty about 1810. The same board room is still used today]]

When the office of Lord High Admiral was in commission, as it was for most of the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries until it reverted to [[the Crown]], it was exercised by a Board of Admiralty, officially known as the ''Commissioners for Exercising the Office of Lord High Admiral of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, &amp;c.'' (alternatively of [[Kingdom of England|England]], [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] or the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] depending on the period).

The Board of Admiralty consisted of a number of [[Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty]]. The Lords Commissioners were always a mixture of [[admiral]]s, known as [[Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty|Naval Lords or Sea Lords]], and Civil Lords, normally politicians. The [[quorum]] of the Board was two commissioners and a secretary.

The president of the Board was known as the First Lord of the Admiralty, who was a member of the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]]. After 1806, the First Lord of the Admiralty was always a civilian, while the professional head of the navy came to be (and is still today) known as the [[First Sea Lord]].

==Admiralty buildings==
[[File:Admiralty 1794 Draughtsman; Chawner, Thomas.jpg|thumb|right|The Admiralty complex in 1794. The colours indicate departments or residences for the several Lords of the Admiralty. The pale coloured extension behind the small courtyard on the left is Admiralty House.]]
The Admiralty complex lies between [[Whitehall]], [[Horse Guards Parade]] and [[The Mall (London)|The Mall]] and includes five buildings. Since the Admiralty no longer exists as a department, these are now used as an &quot;office bank&quot; by the British government:

===The Admiralty===
The oldest building was long known simply as ''The Admiralty'', and is now referred to popularly as the ''Old Admiralty'' and officially as the [[Thomas Ripley (architect)|Ripley Building]].

It is a three storey U-shaped brick building completed in 1726. [[Alexander Pope]] implied the architecture is rather dull, lacking either the vigour of the [[baroque]] style which was fading from fashion at the time, or the austere grandeur of the [[Palladian]] style which was just coming into vogue. It is mainly notable for being perhaps the first purpose built office building in Great Britain. It contained a board room, other state rooms and offices and apartments for the Lords of the Admiralty. [[Robert Adam]] designed the screen which was added to the entrance front in 1788. Nowadays the Ripley Building is allocated to the [[Cabinet Office]].

File:Admiraliteit london 1830.jpg|Old Admiralty (Ripley Building) circa 1830
&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Admiralty House===
[[Admiralty House (London)|Admiralty House]] is a moderately proportioned mansion to the south of the Ripley Building, built in the late 18th century as the residence of the First Lord of the Admiralty, serving that purpose until 1964. [[Winston Churchill]] was one of its occupants. It lacks its own entrance from Whitehall, and is entered through the Ripley Building. It is a three storey building in yellow brick with [[Neoclassical architecture|neo-classicistic]] interiors. Its rear facade faces directly onto Horse Guards Parade. The architect was [[Samuel Pepys Cockerell]]. There are now three ministerial flats in the building.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/briefings/snpc-03367.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Old Admiralty Building (or Admiralty Extension or OAB)===
[[Image:Admiralty Extension from Horse Guards Parade - Sept 2006.jpg|thumb|right|The Admiralty Extension (which is also one of the two buildings which are sometimes referred to as the &quot;Old Admiralty&quot;) dates from the turn of the 20th century.]]
This is the largest of the Admiralty Buildings. It was begun in the late 19th century and redesigned while the construction was in progress to accommodate the extra offices needed due to the naval arms race with the [[German Empire]]. It is a red brick building with white stone detailing in the [[Queen Anne style architecture|Queen Anne style]] with French influences. It is now used by the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]].

Foreign and Commonwealth Office staff refer to the building as the OAB (Old Admiralty Building).

===Admiralty Arch===
[[File:Admiralty Arch, London, England - June 2009.jpg|thumb|left|Admiralty Arch]]
[[Admiralty Arch]] is linked to the Old Admiralty Building by a bridge and is part of the ceremonial route from Trafalgar Square to [[Buckingham Palace]]. It contains further office space currently used by the Cabinet Office.

===The Admiralty Citadel===
This is a squat windowless [[World War II]] fortress north west of Horse Guards Parade, now covered in ivy. See [[Military citadels under London]] for further details.

==&quot;Admiralty&quot; as a metonym for &quot;sea power&quot;==
[[File:Admiralty Citadel2008.jpg|thumb|right|Admiralty citadel|Bomb proof citadel constructed 1940 for Admiralty headquarters]]
In some cases, the term ''admiralty'' is used in a wider sense, as meaning ''[[Naval warfare|sea power]]'' or ''rule over the seas'', rather than in strict reference to the institution exercising such power. For example, the well-known lines from [[Kipling]]'s ''Song of the Dead'':

'''Amputation''' is the removal of a body extremity by [[Physical trauma|trauma]] or [[surgery]]. As a surgical measure, it is used to control pain or a disease process in the affected limb, such as [[cancer|malignancy]] or [[gangrene]]. In some cases, it is carried out on individuals as a preventative surgery for such problems. A special case is the [[congenital amputation]], a [[congenital disorder]], where [[foetus|foetal]] limbs have been cut off by constrictive bands. In some countries, amputation of the hands or feet is or was used as a form of [[punishment]] for people who committed crimes. Amputation has also been used as a tactic in war and acts of terrorism; it may also occur as a war injury. In some cultures and religions, minor amputations or mutilations are considered a ritual accomplishment. Unlike some non-mammalian animals (such as [[lizard]]s that shed their tails, [[salamanders]] that can regrow many missing body parts, and [[hydras]], [[flatworms]], and [[starfish]] that can regrow entire bodies from small fragments), once removed, human extremities do not grow back, unlike portions of some organs, such as the [[liver]]. A [[Organ transplant|transplant]] or a [[prosthesis]] are the only options for recovering the loss.

In the US, the majority of new amputations occur due to complications of the vascular system (of or pertaining to the blood vessels), especially from diabetes. Between 1988 and 1996, there was an average of 133,735 hospital discharges for amputation per year in the US. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amputee-coalition.org/fact_sheets/amp_stats_cause.html Amputee Coalition Factsheet]&lt;/ref&gt;. 


==Types==
Types of amputation include:
* [[Leg]]
** amputation of [[toe|digits]]
** partial foot amputation (Chopart, [[Tarsometatarsal articulations|Lisfranc]], Ray)
** ankle disarticulation (Syme,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pinzur |first=M.S. |authorlink=  |year=2003 |month=September |title=Syme ankle disarticulation in patients with diabetes |journal=J Bone Joint Surg Am |volume=85-A |issue=9 |pages=1667‚Äì1672 |id= |url= |accessdate= |quote= |pmid=12954823 |last2=Stuck |first2=RM |last3=Sage |first3=R |last4=Hunt |first4=N |last5=Rabinovich |first5=Z }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pyrogoff)
** below-knee amputation (transtibial e.g. Burgess, Kingsley Robinson)
** knee-bearing amputation (knee disarticulation, e.g. Gritti or Gritti-Stokes)
** above knee amputation (transfemoral)
** Van-ness rotation/[[rotationplasty]] (Foot being turned around and reattached to allow the ankle joint to be used as a knee.)
** hip disarticulation
** [[hemipelvectomy]]/hindquarter amputation
* [[Arm]]
** amputation of [[finger|digits]]
** [[metacarpal]] amputation
** wrist disarticulation
** forearm amputation (transradial)
** elbow disarticulation
** above-elbow amputation (transhumeral)
** shoulder disarticulation and [[forequarter amputation]]
** [[Krukenberg procedure]]
* [[Teeth]]
** The avulsion of some teeth (mainly incisives) is or was practiced by some cultures for ritual purposes (for instance in the [[Iberomaurusian]] culture of [[Prehistoric Central North Africa|Neolithic North Africa]]).

[[Castration]], or the amputation of the genitals. 

[[Hemicorporectomy]], or amputation at the waist, and [[decapitation]], or amputation at the neck, are the most radical amputations.

[[Genital modification and mutilation]] may involve amputating tissue, although not necessarily as a result of injury or disease.

As a rule, partial amputations are preferred to preserve joint function, but in oncological surgery, disarticulation is favored.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

===Self-amputation===
{{See also|Autotomy}}

In some rare cases when a person has become trapped in a deserted place, with no means of communication or hope of rescue, the victim has amputated their own limb:
* In 2007, 66-year-old Al Hill amputated his leg below the knee using his pocketknife after the leg got stuck beneath a fallen tree he was cutting in [[California]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.breitbart.com/article.php?id=D8PJM6B80&amp;show_article=1 Man Pinned Under Tree Amputates His Leg]&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2003, 27-year-old [[Aron Ralston]] amputated his [[forearm]] using his [[pocketknife]] and breaking and tearing the two [[bone]]s, after the arm got stuck under a boulder when hiking in [[Utah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/nation/20030509climbernat2.asp|title=CMU grad describes cutting off his arm to save his life|accessdate=2008-05-07 | work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette | first=J.

* In 2003, an Australian coal miner amputated his own arm with a [[Stanley knife]] after it became trapped when the [[front-end loader]] he was driving overturned three kilometers underground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/06/29/1056825279321.html | title=Arm trapped, and fearing fire, tough miner knew what to do | work=The Sydney Morning Herald|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uKenlzUO |archivedate = 2010-11-18|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the 1990s, a crab fisherman got his arm caught in the winch during a storm and had to amputate it at the shoulder, as reported in [[The New Englander]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

Even rarer are cases where self-amputation is performed for criminal or political purposes:
* About 50 people in [[Vernon, Florida]] collected insurance claims for loss-of-limb accidents in the late 1950s and early 1960s; this was more than two-thirds of all such claims in the United States during that time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sptimes.com/2007/09/02/Life/Dismembered_again.shtml Life: Dismembered again]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.errolmorris.com/content/profile/singer_predilections.html Errol Morris: Profiles]&lt;/ref&gt;
* On March 7, 1998, Daniel Rudolph, the elder brother of the [[Centennial Olympic Park bombing|1996 Olympics bomber]] [[Eric Robert Rudolph]], videotaped himself cutting off one of his own hands with an electric saw in order to &quot;send a message to the FBI and the media.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www-cgi.cnn.com/US/9803/09/briefs.pm/rudolph.amputation/ |title = Bombing suspect's brother cuts hand off with saw | date = March 9, 1998 |archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uKep10x6 |archivedate = 2010-11-18|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Body Integrity Identity Disorder]] is a psychological condition in which an individual feels compelled to remove one or more of their body parts, usually a limb.  In some cases, that individual may take drastic measures to remove the offending appendages, either by causing irreparable damage to the limb so that medical intervention cannot save the limb, or by causing the limb to be severed.

==Causes of amputation==
===Circulatory disorders===
* [[Diabetes|Diabetic]] foot infection or [[gangrene]] (the most common reason for non-traumatic amputation)
* [[Sepsis]] with peripheral necrosis

===Neoplasm===
[[image:1daypost.jpg|thumb|right|Transfemoral amputation due to liposarcoma]]* Cancerous bone or soft tissue tumors (e.g. [[osteosarcoma]], [[osteochondroma]], [[fibrosarcoma]], [[epithelioid sarcoma]], [[ewing's sarcoma]], [[synovial sarcoma]], [[sacrococcygeal teratoma]], [[liposarcoma]])
* [[Melanoma]]

===Trauma===
* Severe limb [[injury|injuries]] in which the limb cannot be spared or attempts to spare the limb have failed
* [[Physical trauma|Traumatic]] amputation (an unwanted amputation that occurs at the scene of an accident, where the limb is partially or wholly severed as a direct result of the accident, for example a fingertip that is cut off by a meat grinder).
* Amputation in utero ([[Amniotic band]])

===Deformities===
* Deformities of digits and/or limbs
* Extra digits and/or limbs (e.g. [[polydactyly]])

===Infection===
* Bone infection ([[osteomyelitis]])

===Athletic performance===
* Sometimes professional [[Sportsperson|athletes]] may choose to have a non-essential digit amputated to relieve chronic pain and impaired performance. Australian Rules footballer [[Daniel Chick]] elected to have his left [[ring finger]] amputated as chronic pain and injury was limiting his performance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rte.ie/sport/2002/0122/aussierules.html RTE: Aussie Rules star has finger removed]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rugby union]] player [[Jone Tawake]] also had a finger removed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sportsaustralia.com/articles/oct06/artid6659.html SportsAustralia.com: Tawake undergoes surgery to remove finger]&lt;/ref&gt; [[NFL]] [[safety]] [[Ronnie Lott]] had the tip of his little finger removed after it was damaged in the [[1985 NFL season]].

===Legal punishment===
* Amputation is used as a [[physical punishment|legal punishment]] in a number of countries, among them Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, and Islamic regions of Nigeria. .&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/topic,4565c2252,45d0822f2,478b625016062,0.html UNHCR article on amputation as a punishment in Iran.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Method==
[[File:Curvy amputation knife DSC09451.jpg|thumb|200px|Curved knives such as this one were used, in the past, for some kinds of amputations.]]
The first step is [[ligature (medicine)|ligating]] the supplying [[artery]] and [[vein]], to prevent [[hemorrhage]]. The muscles are transected, and finally the [[bone]] is sawed through with an [[oscillating saw]]. Sharp and rough edges of the bone(s) are filed down, skin and muscle flaps are then transposed over the stump, occasionally with the insertion of elements to attach a [[prosthesis]].

==Prevention==
Amputations are traumatic experiences that reduces the quality of life for patients and is also expensive. A typical prosthetic limb costs in the range of $10,000-15,000 according to the American Diabetic Association. Preventing amputations is a critical task. 

Methods in preventing amputation depend on the problems that might cause amputations to be necessary. Chronic infections, often caused by diabetes or decubitus ulcers in bed ridden patients, are common causes of infections that lead to gangrene, which would then necessitate amputation. 

There are two key challenges : first, many patients have impaired circulation in their extremities, and second, they have difficulty curing infections in limbs with poor vasculation (blood circulation).
 
Various approaches have been attempted to work around these problems, which includes [[hyperbaric oxygen therapy]] (HBOT) and low powered lasers. HBOT has proved to be particularly effective in revascularizing or rebuilding the smaller blood vessels in extremities and, as a result, preventing deterioration of the tissue and resulting infections. At the same time, delivering oxygen under pressure in a hyperbaric chamber increases oxygenation by up to 400 times in the blood, speeding up healing processes and killing off anearobic bacteria (gas gangrene), the source of infections. The general research conclusion is that around 80% of resistant diabetic infections can be cured with HBOT.

Crush injuries where there is extensive tissue damage and poor circulation also benefit from HBOT. The high level of oxygenation and revascularization speeds up recovery times and prevents infections.

A study found that the patented method called Circulator Boot got significant results in prevention of amputation in patients of diabetes and arterioscleorosis.&lt;ref name=dillon1&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Angiology |date= May 1997 |volume= 48 |issue= 5 (part 2) |title= Fifteen Years of Experience in Treating 2177 Episodes of Foot and Leg Lessions with the Circulator Boot |author= Richard S.

For victims of trauma, advances in [[microsurgery]] in the 70's has made replantations of severed body parts possible.

==Prognosis==
The individual may experience psychological trauma as well as emotional discomfort. The stump will remain an area of reduced mechanical stability. Limb loss can present significant or even drastic practical limitations.

A large proportion of amputees (50-80%) experience the phenomenon of [[phantom limb]]s;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | month = January | year = 2005 | title = Phantom Input | author = Heidi Schultz | work = The Science of Things | journal = National Geographic Magazine |url=http://magma.nationalgeographic.com/ngm/0501/resources_who.html }} {{Dead link|date=November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; they feel body parts that are no longer there. These limbs can itch, ache, burn, feel tense, dry or wet, locked in or trapped or they can feel as if they are moving. Some scientists believe it has to do with a kind of neural map that the brain has of the body, which sends information to the rest of the brain about limbs regardless of their existence. Phantom sensations and phantom pain may also occur after the removal of body parts other than the limbs, e.g. after amputation of the breast, extraction of a tooth (phantom tooth pain) or removal of an eye ([[phantom eye syndrome]]).

A similar phenomenon is unexplained sensation in a body part unrelated to the amputated limb. It has been hypothesized that the portion of the brain responsible for processing stimulation from amputated limbs, being deprived of input, expands into the surrounding brain, (Phantoms in the Brain: V. S. Ramachandran and Sandra Blakeslee) such that an individual who has had an arm amputated will experience unexplained pressure or movement on his face or head{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}.

In many cases, the phantom limb aids in adaptation to a prosthesis, as it permits the person to experience [[proprioception]] of the prosthetic limb. To support improved resistance or usability, comfort or healing, some type of [[stump sock]]s may be worn instead of or as part of wearing a prosthesis.

Another side effect can be [[heterotopic ossification]], especially when a bone injury is combined with a head injury. The brain signals the bone to grow instead of scar tissue to form, and nodules and other growth can interfere with prosthetics and sometimes require further operations. This type of injury has been especially common among soldiers wounded by [[improvised explosive device]]s in the [[Iraq war]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/03/26/MNSOLDIERS26.DTL | title=War without end / Damaged soldiers start their agonizing recoveries | first=Joan | last=Ryan | date=March 25, 2006 | work=The San Francisco Chronicle|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uKeplkmD |archivedate = 2010-11-18|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to technologic advances in prosthetics, amputees can live active lives with little restriction. Organizations such as the [[Challenged Athletes Foundation]] have been developed to give amputees the opportunity to be involved in athletics and [[adaptive sports]] such as [[Team Zaryen|Amputee Soccer]].

==History==
The word amputation is derived from the [[Latin]] ''amputare'', &quot;to cut away&quot;, from ''ambi-'' (&quot;about&quot;, &quot;around&quot;) and ''putare'' (&quot;to prune&quot;). The Latin word has never been recorded in a surgical context, being reserved to indicate punishment for criminals. The English word &quot;amputation&quot; was first applied to surgery in the 17th century, possibly first in Peter Lowe's ''A discourse of the Whole Art of Chirurgerie'' (published in either 1597 or 1612); his work was derived from 16th century French texts and early English writers also used the words &quot;extirpation&quot; (16th century French texts tended to use ''extirper''), &quot;[[disarticulation]]&quot;, and &quot;[[dismemberment]]&quot; (from the Old French ''desmembrer'' and a more common term before the 17th century for limb loss or removal), or simply &quot;cutting&quot;, but by the end of the 17th century &quot;amputation&quot; had come to dominate as the accepted medical term.

[[File:Anemometer 2745.JPG|thumb|Cup-type anemometer with vertical axis, a sensor on a remote meteorological station deployed on [[Skagit Bay]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] July&amp;ndash;August, 2009.]]
An '''anemometer''' is a device for measuring wind speed, and is a common [[weather station]] instrument. The term is derived from the Greek word ''anemos'', meaning wind, and is used to describe any airspeed measurement instrument used in [[meteorology]] or [[aerodynamics]]. The first known description of an anemometer was given by [[Leon Battista Alberti]] around 1450.&lt;ref&gt;Invention of the Meteorological Instruments, W.E. Knowles Middleton, Johns Hopkins Press, Baltimore, 1969&lt;/ref&gt;

Anemometers can be divided into two classes: those that measure the wind's speed, and those that measure the wind's pressure; but as there is a close connection between the pressure and the speed, an anemometer designed for one will give information about both.

==Velocity anemometers==
===Cup anemometers===
A simple type of anemometer, invented (1846) by Dr. [[John Thomas Romney Robinson]], of [[Armagh Observatory]]. It consisted of four [[hemispherical]] cups each mounted on one end of four horizontal arms, which in turn were mounted at equal angles to each other on a vertical shaft. The air flow past the cups in any horizontal direction turned the cups in a manner that was proportional to the wind speed. Therefore, counting the turns of the cups over a set time period produced the average wind speed for a wide range of speeds. On an anemometer with four cups it is easy to see that since the cups are arranged symmetrically on the end of the arms, the wind always has the hollow of one cup presented to it and is blowing on the back of the cup on the opposite end of the cross.

When Robinson first designed his anemometer, he asserted that the cups moved one-third of the speed of the wind, unaffected by the cup size or arm length. This was apparently confirmed by some early independent experiments, but it was incorrect.  Instead, the ratio of the speed of the wind and that of the cups, the anemometer factor, depends on the dimensions of the cups and arms, and may have a value between two and a little over three. Every experiment involving an anemometer had to be repeated.

The three cup anemometer developed by the Canadian John Patterson in 1926 and subsequent cup improvements by Brevoort &amp; Joiner of the USA in 1935 led to a cupwheel design which was linear and had an error of less than 3% up to {{convert|60|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}. Patterson found that each cup produced maximum torque when it was at 45 degrees to the wind flow. The three cup anemometer also had a more constant torque and responded more quickly to gusts than the four cup anemometer.

The three cup anemometer was further modified by the Australian Derek Weston in 1991 to measure both wind direction and wind speed. Weston added a tag to one cup, which causes the cupwheel speed to increase and decrease as the tag moves alternately with and against the wind. Wind direction is calculated from these cyclical changes in cupwheel speed, while wind speed is as usual determined from the average cupwheel speed.

Three cup anemometers are currently used as the industry standard for [[wind resource assessment]] studies.

===Windmill anemometers===
The other forms of mechanical velocity anemometer may be described as belonging to the [[windmill]] type or propeller anemometer. In the Robinson anemometer the axis of rotation is vertical, but with this subdivision the axis of rotation must be parallel to the direction of the wind and therefore horizontal. Furthermore, since the wind varies in direction and the axis has to follow its changes, a [[weather vane|wind vane]] or some other contrivance to fulfill the same purpose must be employed. An ''aerovane'' combines a propeller and a tail on the same axis to obtain accurate and precise wind speed and direction measurements from the same instrument. In cases where the direction of the air motion is always the same, as in the ventilating shafts of mines and buildings for instance, wind vanes, known as air meters are employed, and give most satisfactory results.

===Hot-wire anemometers===
[[Image:Hd sonde.jpg|thumb|Hot-wire sensor]]
Hot wire anemometers use a very fine wire (on the order of several micrometres) electrically heated up to some temperature above the ambient. Air flowing past the wire has a cooling effect on the wire. As the electrical resistance of most metals is dependent upon the temperature of the metal ([[tungsten]] is a popular choice for hot-wires), a relationship can be obtained between the resistance of the wire and the flow speed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.efunda.com/designstandards/sensors/hot_wires/hot_wires_intro.cfm | title = Hot-wire Anemometer explanation | publisher = eFunda | accessdate = September 18, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several ways of implementing this exist, and hot-wire devices can be further classified as CCA (Constant-Current Anemometer), CVA (Constant-Voltage Anemometer) and CTA (Constant-Temperature Anemometer). The voltage output from these anemometers is thus the result of some sort of circuit within the device trying to maintain the specific variable (current, voltage or temperature) constant.

Additionally, PWM ([[pulse-width modulation]]) anemometers are also used, wherein the velocity is inferred by the time length of a repeating pulse of current that brings the wire up to a specified resistance and then stops until a threshold &quot;floor&quot; is reached, at which time the pulse is sent again.

Hot-wire anemometers, while extremely delicate, have extremely high frequency-response and fine spatial resolution compared to other measurement methods, and as such are almost universally employed for the detailed study of turbulent flows, or any flow in which rapid velocity fluctuations are of interest.

===Laser Doppler anemometers===
[[Image:Laser anemometer.png|thumb|400px|Drawing of a laser anemometer. The laser is emitted (1) through the front lens (6) of the anemometer and is backscattered off the air molecules (7). The backscattered radiation (dots) re-enter the device and are reflected and directed into a detector (12).]]

Laser Doppler anemometers use a beam of light from a [[laser]] that is divided into two beams, with one propagated out of the anemometer.  Particulates (or deliberately introduced seed material) flowing along with air molecules near where the beam exits reflect, or backscatter, the light back into a detector, where it is measured relative to the original laser beam. When the particles are in great motion, they produce a [[Doppler shift]] for measuring wind speed in the laser light, which is used to calculate the speed of the particles, and therefore the air around the anemometer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Iten | first = Paul D. | date = June 29, 1976 | url = http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?patentnumber=3966324 | title =  Laser doppler anemometer | publisher = United States Patent and Trademark Office | accessdate = September 18, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sonic anemometers===
[[Image:WindMaster.jpg|left|thumb|3D ultrasonic anemometer]]

Sonic anemometers, first developed in the 1970s, use [[ultrasound|ultrasonic sound waves]] to measure wind velocity. They measure wind speed based on the time of flight of sonic pulses between pairs of [[transducer]]s. Measurements from pairs of transducers can be combined to yield a measurement of velocity in 1-, 2-, or 3-dimensional flow. The [[spatial resolution]] is given by the path length between transducers, which is typically 10 to 20 [[centimeter|cm]]. Sonic anemometers can take measurements with very fine [[temporal resolution]], 20 [[hertz|Hz]] or better, which makes them well suited for [[turbulence]] measurements. The lack of moving parts makes them appropriate for long term use in exposed automated weather stations and weather buoys where the accuracy and reliability of traditional cup-and-vane anemometers is adversely affected by salty air or large amounts of dust. Their main disadvantage is the distortion of the flow itself by the structure supporting the transducers, which requires a correction based upon wind tunnel measurements to minimize the effect. An international standard for this process, [[ISO 16622]] ''Meteorology‚ÄîSonic anemometers/thermometers‚ÄîAcceptance test methods for mean wind measurements'' is in general circulation. Another disadvantage is lower accuracy due to precipitation, where rain drops may vary the [[speed of sound]].

Since the speed of sound varies with temperature, and is virtually stable with pressure change, sonic anomometers are also used as [[thermometers]].

Two-dimensional (wind speed and wind direction) sonic anemometers are used in applications such as weather stations, ship navigation, wind turbines, aviation and [[weather buoy]]s.

===Ping-pong ball anemometers===
A common anemometer for basic use is constructed from a [[table tennis#Ball|ping-pong ball]] attached to a string. When the wind blows horizontally, it presses on and moves the ball; because ping-pong balls are very lightweight, they move easily in light winds. Measuring the angle between the string-ball apparatus and the line [[perpendicularity|normal]] to the ground gives an estimate of the wind speed.

This type of anemometer is mostly used for middle-school level instruction which most students make themselves, but a similar device was also flown on [[Phoenix_Mars_Lander#Meteorological_station|Phoenix Mars Lander]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} .

==Pressure anemometers==
The first designs of anemometers which measure the pressure were divided into plate and tube classes.

===Plate anemometers===
These are the earliest anemometers and are simply a flat plate suspended from the top so that the wind deflects the plate. In 1450, the Italian art architect Leon Battista Alberti invented the first mechanical anemometer; in 1664 it was re-invented by Robert Hooke (who is often mistakenly considered the inventor of the first anemometer). Later versions of this form consisted of a flat plate, either square or circular, which is kept normal to the wind by a wind vane. The pressure of the wind on its face is balanced by a spring. The compression of the spring determines the actual force which the wind is exerting on the plate, and this is either read off on a suitable gauge, or on a recorder. Instruments of this kind do not respond to light winds, are inaccurate for high wind readings, and are slow at responding to variable winds. Plate anemometers have been used to trigger high wind alarms on bridges.They are used on these high places because they are in a plate shape; has a good measurment status on higher altitudes. 

===Tube anemometers===
[[Image:Prop vane anemometer.jpg|thumb|[[Helicoid]] propeller anemometer incorporating a [[wind vane]] for orientation.]]

James Lind's anemometer of 1775 consisted simply of a glass U tube containing a liquid [[manometer]] (pressure gauge), with one end bent in a horizontal direction to face the wind and the other vertical end remains parallel to the wind flow. Though the Lind was not the first it was the most practical and best known anemometer of this type. If the wind blows into the mouth of a tube it causes an increase of pressure on one side of the manometer. The wind over the open end of a vertical tube causes little change in pressure on the other side of the manometer. The resulting liquid change in the U tube is an indication of the wind speed. Small departures from the true direction of the wind causes large variations in the magnitude.

The highly successful metal pressure tube anemometer of William Henry Dines in 1892 utilized the same pressure difference between the open mouth of a straight tube facing the wind and a ring of small holes in a vertical tube which is closed at the upper end. Both are mounted at the same height. The pressure differences on which the action depends are very small, and special means are required to register them. The recorder consists of a float in a sealed chamber partially filled with water. The pipe from the straight tube is connected to the top of the sealed chamber and the pipe from the small tubes is directed into the bottom inside the float. Since the pressure difference determines the vertical position of the float this is a measure of the wind speed.

The great advantage of the tube anemometer lies in the fact that the exposed part can be mounted on a high pole, and requires no oiling or attention for years; and the registering part can be placed in any convenient position. Two connecting tubes are required. It might appear at first sight as though one connection would serve, but the differences in pressure on which these instruments depend are so minute, that the pressure of the air in the room where the recording part is placed has to be considered. Thus if the instrument depends on the pressure or suction effect alone, and this pressure or suction is measured against the air pressure in an ordinary room, in which the doors and windows are carefully closed and a newspaper is then burnt up the chimney, an effect may be produced equal to a wind of 10&amp;nbsp;mi/h (16&amp;nbsp;km/h); and the opening of a window in rough weather, or the opening of a door, may entirely alter the registration.

While the Dines anemometer had an error of only 1% at {{convert|10|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} it did not respond very well to low winds due to the poor response of the flat plate vane required to turn the head into the wind. In 1918 an aerodynamic vane with eight times the torque of the flat plate overcame this problem.

===Effect of density on measurements===
In the tube anemometer the pressure is measured, although the scale is usually graduated as a velocity scale. In cases where the density of the air is significantly different from the calibration value (as on a high mountain, or with an exceptionally low barometer) an allowance must be made. Approximately 1¬Ω% should be added to the velocity recorded by a tube anemometer for each 1000&amp;nbsp;ft (5% for each kilometer) above sea-level.

The name derives from the [[Ancient Greek]] {{Polytonic|[[wikt:·ºÄœÅœáŒ±·øñŒøœÇ|·ºÄœÅœáŒ±·øñŒøœÇ]]}} (''archaƒ´os'') meaning &quot;ancient&quot;, and {{Polytonic|[[wikt:œÄœÑŒ≠œÅœÖŒæ|œÄœÑŒ≠œÅœÖŒæ]]}} (''pt√©ryx''), meaning &quot;feather&quot; or &quot;wing&quot;.

''Archaeopteryx'' lived in the [[Late Jurassic]] [[Period (geology)|Period]] around 150&amp;nbsp;million years ago, in what is now southern [[Germany]] during a time when [[Europe]] was an archipelago of islands in a shallow warm tropical sea, much closer to the [[equator]] than it is now.

Similar in shape to a [[European Magpie]], with the largest individuals possibly attaining the size of a [[raven]],&lt;ref name=Erickson_etal_2009/&gt; ''Archaeopteryx'' could grow to about 0.5&amp;nbsp;metres (1.6&amp;nbsp;ft) in length. Despite its small size, broad wings, and inferred ability to fly or glide, ''Archaeopteryx'' has more in common with small [[theropod]] [[dinosaur]]s than it does with modern [[bird]]s. In particular, it shares the following features with the [[deinonychosaur]]s ([[dromaeosaur]]s and [[troodontid]]s): jaws with sharp teeth, three fingers with claws, a long bony tail, hyperextensible second toes (&quot;killing claw&quot;), feathers (which also suggest [[homeothermy]]), and various skeletal features.&lt;ref name=Yalden_1/&gt;&lt;ref name=UCal_Chiappe/&gt; The features above make ''Archaeopteryx'' a clear candidate for a [[transitional fossil]] between dinosaurs and birds.&lt;ref name=UCal_MoP/&gt;&lt;ref name=UCalg_Long/&gt; Thus, ''Archaeopteryx'' plays an important role not only in the study of the [[origin of birds]] but in the study of dinosaurs. It was named from a [[feather]] in 1861. That same year, the first complete specimen of ''Archaeopteryx'' was announced; this was only two years after [[Charles Darwin]] published ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', and it became a key piece of evidence in the debate over [[evolution]]. Over the years, nine more fossils of ''Archaeopteryx'' have surfaced. Despite variation among these fossils, most experts regard all the remains that have been discovered as belonging to a single species, though this is still debated.

Most of these eleven fossils include impressions of feathers‚Äîamong the oldest direct evidence of such structures. Moreover, because these feathers are of an advanced form ([[flight feather]]s), these fossils are evidence that the evolution of feathers began before the Late Jurassic.&lt;ref name=weln_04/&gt;

''Archaeopteryx'' was a [[Primitive (phylogenetics)|primitive]] [[bird]] that lived during the early [[Tithonian]] [[faunal stage|stage]] of the [[Jurassic]] Period, around 150.8‚Äì148.5&amp;nbsp;million years ago.&lt;ref name=&quot;ammonitedate&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schweigert | first1 = G. | year = 2007 | title = Ammonite biostratigraphy as a tool for dating Upper Jurassic lithographic limestones from South Germany ‚Äì first results and open questions | url = | journal = Neues Jahrbuch f√ºr Geologie und Pal√§ontologie - Abhandlungen | volume = 245 | issue = 1| pages = 117‚Äì125 | doi = 10.1127/0077-7749/2007/0245-0117 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the specimens of ''Archaeopteryx'' that have been discovered come from the [[Solnhofen limestone]] in [[Bavaria]], southern [[Germany]], which is a ''[[lagerst√§tte]]'', a rare and remarkable geological formation known for its superbly detailed fossils.&lt;ref name=Lambert/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kennedy 1&quot;/&gt;

''Archaeopteryx'' was roughly the size of a [[raven]],&lt;ref name=Erickson_etal_2009/&gt; with broad wings that were rounded at the ends and a long tail compared to its body length. It could reach up to {{convert|500|mm|in}} in body length, with an estimated weight of {{convert|0.8|to|1|kg|lb}}.&lt;ref name=Erickson_etal_2009/&gt; ''Archaeopteryx'' feathers, although less documented than its other features, were very similar in structure and design to modern-day bird feathers.&lt;ref name=Lambert/&gt; However, despite the presence of numerous avian features,&lt;ref name=Holtz/&gt; ''Archaeopteryx'' had many [[theropoda|theropod dinosaur]] characteristics. Unlike modern birds, ''Archaeopteryx'' had small teeth&lt;ref name=Lambert/&gt; as well as a long bony tail, features which ''Archaeopteryx'' shared with other dinosaurs of the time.&lt;ref name=Paleogeo/&gt;

Because it displays a number of features common to both birds and dinosaurs, ''Archaeopteryx'' has often been considered a link between them‚Äîpossibly the first bird in its change from a land dweller to a bird.&lt;ref name=Lambert/&gt; In the 1970s, [[John Ostrom]], following [[Thomas Henry Huxley|T. H. Huxley]]'s lead in 1868, argued that birds evolved within theropod dinosaurs and ''Archaeopteryx'' was a critical piece of evidence for this argument; it had a number of avian features, such as a wishbone, flight feathers, wings and a partially reversed first toe, and a number of dinosaur and theropod features. For instance, it has a long ascending process of the [[Talus bone|ankle bone]], [[interdental plate]]s, an [[obturator foramen|obturator]] process of the [[ischium]], and long chevrons in the tail. In particular, Ostrom found that ''Archaeopteryx'' was remarkably similar to the theropod family [[Dromaeosauridae]].&lt;ref name=Buhler/&gt;&lt;ref name=Huxley_1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Huxley_2/&gt;&lt;ref name=Huxley_3/&gt;&lt;ref name=Nedin_1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Olson_1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ostrom_1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ostrom_2/&gt;&lt;ref name=Owen_1/&gt;

The first remains of ''Archaeopteryx'' were discovered in 1861; just two years after [[Charles Darwin]] published ''[[On the Origin of Species]]''. ''Archaeopteryx'' seemed to confirm Darwin's theories and has since become a key piece of evidence for the [[origin of birds]], the [[transitional fossil]]s debate, and confirmation of [[evolution]]. Indeed, further research on dinosaurs from the [[Gobi Desert]] and [[China]] has since provided more evidence of a link between ''Archaeopteryx'' and the dinosaurs, such as the Chinese [[feathered dinosaurs]]. ''Archaeopteryx'' is close to the ancestry of modern birds, and it shows most of the features one would expect in an ancestral bird. However, it may not be the direct ancestor of living birds, and it is uncertain how much evolutionary divergence was already present among other birds at the time.

==Paleobiology==
===Plumage===
[[Image:Vog1h.jpg|thumb|upright|1880 photo of the Berlin ''Archaeopteryx'' specimen, showing leg feathers that were subsequently removed during preparation]] 
Specimens  of ''Archaeopteryx'' were most notable for their well-developed [[flight feather]]s. They were markedly asymmetrical and showed the structure of flight feathers in modern birds, with vanes given stability by a [[barb (feather)|barb]]-[[barbule]]-barbicel arrangement.&lt;ref name=&quot;Feduc 2&quot;/&gt; The tail feathers were less asymmetrical, again in line with the situation in modern birds and also had firm vanes. The [[thumb]], however, did not yet bear a separately movable tuft of [[alula|stiff feathers]].

The body plumage of ''Archaeopteryx'' is less well documented and has only been properly researched in the well-preserved Berlin specimen. Thus, as more than one species seems to be involved, the research into the Berlin specimen's feathers does not necessarily hold true for the rest of the species of ''Archaeopteryx''. In the Berlin specimen, there are &quot;trousers&quot; of well-developed feathers on the legs; some of these feathers seem to have a basic contour feather structure but are somewhat decomposed (they lack [[barbicel]]s as in [[ratite]]s).&lt;ref name=Christ_Bond_04/&gt; However, in part they are firm and thus capable of supporting flight.&lt;ref name=Longrich_1/&gt;

There was a patch of [[pennaceous feather]]s running along the back which was quite similar to the contour feathers of the body plumage of modern birds in being symmetrical and firm, though not as stiff as the flight-related feathers. Apart from that, the feather traces in the Berlin specimen are limited to a sort of &quot;proto-[[Down feather|down]]&quot; not dissimilar to that found in the dinosaur ''[[Sinosauropteryx]]'', being decomposed and fluffy, and possibly even appeared more like fur than like feathers in life (though not in their microscopic structure). These occur on the remainder of the body, as far as such structures are both preserved and not obliterated by preparation, and the lower neck.&lt;ref name=Christ_Bond_04/&gt;

However, there is no indication of feathering on the upper neck and head. While these may conceivably have been nude, this may still be an artifact of preservation. It appears that most ''Archaeopteryx'' specimens became embedded in [[Oxygen saturation|anoxic]] sediment after drifting some time on their back in the sea‚Äîthe head and neck and the tail are generally bent downwards, which suggests that the specimens had just started to rot when they were embedded, with tendons and muscle relaxing so that the characteristic shape of the fossil specimens was achieved. This would mean that the skin was already softened and loose, which is bolstered by the fact that in some specimens the flight feathers were starting to detach at the point of embedding in the sediment. So it is hypothesized that the pertinent specimens moved along the sea bed in shallow water for some time before burial, the head and upper neck feathers sloughing off, while the more firmly attached tail feathers remained.&lt;ref name=Elzanowski2002/&gt;

===Flight===
&lt;!--&lt;ref name=Lindhe_50:921/&gt;--&gt;As in the wings of modern birds, the flight feathers of ''Archaeopteryx'' were somewhat asymmetrical and the tail feathers were rather broad. This implies that the wings and tail were used for lift generation. However, it is unclear whether ''Archaeopteryx'' was simply a glider or capable of flapping flight. The lack of a bony [[Sternum|breastbone]] suggests that ''Archaeopteryx'' was not a very strong flier, but flight muscles might have attached to the thick, boomerang-shaped wishbone, the platelike [[coracoid]]s, or perhaps to a [[cartilage|cartilaginous]] [[sternum]]. The sideways orientation of the glenoid (shoulder) joint between [[scapula]], [[coracoid]] and [[humerus]]‚Äîinstead of the dorsally angled arrangement found in modern birds‚Äîsuggests that ''Archaeopteryx'' was unable to lift its wings above its back, a requirement for the upstroke found in modern flapping flight. Thus, it seems likely that ''Archaeopteryx'' was indeed unable to use flapping flight as modern birds do, but it may well have utilized a downstroke-only flap-assisted gliding technique.&lt;ref name=senter_1/&gt;
[[Image:Archaeopteryx-modern bird tails.png|thumb|left|Anatomical illustration comparing the &quot;frond-tail&quot; of ''Archaeopteryx'' with the &quot;fan-tail&quot; of a modern bird]] 
''Archaeopteryx'' wings were relatively large, which would have resulted in a low stall speed and reduced [[turning radius]]. The short and rounded shape of the wings would have increased drag, but could also have improved ''Archaeopteryx''' ability to fly through cluttered environments such as trees and brush (similar wing shapes are seen in birds which fly through trees and brush, such as [[crows]] and [[pheasants]]). The presence of &quot;hind wings&quot;, asymmetrical flight feathers stemming from the legs similar to those seen in dromaeosaurids such as ''[[Microraptor]]'', would also have added to the aerial mobility of ''Archaeopteryx''. The first detailed study of the hind wings by Longrich in 2006 suggested that the structures formed up to 12% of the total [[airfoil]]. This would have reduced stall speed by up to 6% and turning radius by up to 12%.&lt;ref name=Longrich_1/&gt;

The feathers of ''Archaeopteryx'' were asymmetrical. This has been interpreted as evidence that it was a flyer, as flightless birds tend to have symmetrical feathers. However, some scientists, including Thomson and Speakman, have questioned this. They studied more than 70 families of living birds, and found that some flightless types do have a range of asymmetry in their feathers, and that the feathers of ''Archaeopteryx'' fall into this range.&lt;ref name=speakmanthomson1994&gt;{{cite journal |last=Speakman |first=J.R. |coauthors=&amp; Thomson, S.C. |year=1994 |title=Flight capabilities of ''Archaeopteryx'' |journal=Nature |volume=370 |issue=6490 |page=514 |doi=10.1038/370514a0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Robert L. Nudds and Gareth J. Dyke in the journal ''Science'' published a paper in which they analysed the rachises of the primary feathers of ''[[Confuciusornis]]'' and ''Archaeopteryx''.  The analysis suggested that the rachises on these two genera were thinner and weaker than those compared to modern birds relative to body weight. The authors determined that ''Archaeopteryx'', along with ''Confuciusornis'', were unable to use flapping flight.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nudds&amp;Dyke2010&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author=Nudds, Robert L. &amp; Dyke, Gareth J.|date=May 14, 2010|title=Narrow Primary Feather Rachises in ''Confuciusornis'' and ''Archaeopteryx'' Suggest Poor Flight Ability|journal=Science|volume=328|issue=5980|pages=887&amp;ndash;889|doi=10.1126/science.1188895|pmid=20466930}}&lt;/ref&gt; This study, however,  was criticized by [[Philip Currie|Currie]] and Luis Chiappe. Chiappe suggested that it is difficult to measure the rachises of fossilized feathers, and Currie speculated that ''Archaeopteryx'' and ''[[Confuciusornis]]'' must have been able to fly to some degree, as their fossils are preserved in what is believed to have been in marine or lake sediments, suggesting that they must have been able to fly over deep water.&lt;ref name=sciencefeatherdebate&gt;Balter, M. (2010). &quot;[http://news.sciencemag.org/sciencenow/2010/05/did-first-feathers-prevent-early.html Did First Feathers Prevent Early Flight?]&quot;. ''Science Now'', 2010-5-13.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gregory Paul]] also disagreed with the study, arguing in a 2010 response that Nudds and Dyke had overestimated the weights of these early birds, and that more accurate weight estimates allowed powered flight even with relatively narrow rachises. Nudds and Dyke had assumed a weight of 250&amp;nbsp;grams for the Munich specimen ''Archaeopteryx'', a young juvenile, based on published weight estimates of larger specimens. Paul argued that a more reasonable body weight estimate for the Munich specimen is about 140&amp;nbsp;grams. Paul also criticized the measurements of the rachises themselves, noting that the feathers in the Munich specimen are poorly preserved. Nudds and Dyke reported a diameter of {{convert|.75|mm}} for the longest primary feather, which Paul could not confirm using photographs. Paul measured some of the inner primary feathers, finding rachises 1.25-1.4&amp;nbsp;mm across.&lt;ref name=paul2010&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Paul |first1= G.S. |title=Comment on 'Narrow Primary Feather Rachises in ''Confuciusornis'' and ''Archaeopteryx'' Suggest Poor Flight Ability.' | journal = Science |volume=330 |issue=6002 |page= 320 |date=15 October 2010 | doi = 10.1126/science.1192963 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these criticisms, Nudds and Dyke stood by their original conclusions. They claimed that Paul's statement that an adult ''Archaeopteryx'' would have been a better flyer than the juvenile Munich specimen was dubious. This, they reasoned, would require even thicker ranchis, evidence for which has not yet been presented.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nudds&amp;Dyke_October2010&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dyke |first1=G.J. |last2= Nudds |first2=R.L |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/330/6002/320.4.full.pdf |title=Response to Comments on  &quot;Narrow Primary Feather Rachises in Confuciusornis and Archaeopteryx Suggest Poor Flight Ability&quot; | journal = Science |volume=330| issue=6002 |page= 320 |date=15 October 2010 | doi = 10.1126/science.1193474 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, scientists analyzing a detailed [[Computed tomography|CT scan]] of the [[braincase]] of ''Archaeopteryx'' concluded that its brain was significantly larger than that of most dinosaurs, indicating that it possessed the brain size necessary for flying. The overall brain anatomy was reconstructed using the scan. The reconstruction showed that the regions associated with vision took up nearly one-third of the brain. Other well-developed areas involved hearing and muscle coordination.&lt;ref name=Witmer_1/&gt; The skull scan also revealed the structure of the inner ear. The structure more closely resembles that of modern birds than the inner ear of reptiles. These characteristics taken together suggest that ''Archaeopteryx'' had the keen sense of hearing, balance, spatial perception and coordination needed to fly.&lt;ref name=Alonso/&gt; ''Archaeopteryx'' had a cerebrum-to-brain-volume ratio 78% of the way to modern birds from the condition of non-[[coelurosaurian]] dinosaurs like ''[[Carcharodontosaurus]]'' or ''[[Allosaurus]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Larsson2001&quot; /&gt; Those dinosaurs had a crocodile-like anatomy of the brain and inner ear.&lt;ref name=&quot;Larsson2001&quot;&gt;Larsson, H.C.E. 2001. Endocranial anatomy of Carcharodontosaurus saharicus (Theropoda: Allosauroidea) and its implications for theropod brain evolution. pp. 19-33. In: Mesozioc Vertebrate Life. Ed.s Tanke, D. H., Carpenter, K., Skrepnick, M. W. Indiana University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; 

''Archaeopteryx'' continues to play an important part in scientific debates about the origin and evolution of birds. Some scientists see it as a semi-arboreal climbing animal, following the idea that birds evolved from tree-dwelling gliders (the &quot;trees down&quot; hypothesis for the evolution of flight proposed by [[Othniel Charles Marsh|O.C. Marsh]]). Other scientists see ''Archaeopteryx'' as running quickly along the ground, supporting the idea that birds evolved flight by running (the &quot;ground up&quot; hypothesis proposed by [[Samuel Wendell Williston]]). Still others suggest that ''Archaeopteryx'' might have been at home both in the trees and on the ground, like modern crows, and this latter view is what today is considered best-supported by morphological characters. Altogether, it appears that the species was not particularly specialized for running on the ground or for perching. A scenario outlined by El≈ºanowski in 2002 suggested that ''Archaeopteryx'' used its wings mainly to escape [[Predation|predators]] by glides punctuated with shallow downstrokes to reach successively higher perches, and alternatively to cover longer distances by (mainly) gliding down from cliffs or treetops.&lt;ref name=Elzanowski2002/&gt;

===Growth===
[[Image:Archaeopteryx growht curve.jpg|thumb|left|Growth trends compared with other dinosaurs and birds]] 
A [[histological]] study by Erickson, Norell, Zhongue and others in 2009 showed that ''Archaeopteryx'' grew relatively slowly compared to modern birds, based on growth lines found in slices of ''Archaeopteryx'' bones.&lt;ref name=Erickson_etal_2009/&gt; According to their study, all known skeletons known of ''Archaeopteryx'' came from juvenile specimens. They estimated that ''Archaeopteryx'' reached adult size in about 970 days (about 2 years and 8 months), and weighed between 0.8 - 1 kilogram. The study also found that the birds ''[[Jeholornis]]'' and ''[[Sapeornis]]'' grew slowly, as did the dromaeosaurid ''[[Mahakala (dinosaur)|Mahakala]]''. The birds ''[[Confuciusornis]]'' and ''[[Ichthyornis]]'', however, grew very quickly, following a growth trend similar to that of modern birds.&lt;ref&gt;''eurekalert.org'': [http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2009-10/amon-wn100809.php &quot;''Archaeopteryx'' was not very bird-like&quot;], 8-10-2009.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the few modern birds which exhibit slow growth is the flightless [[kiwi]], and the authors speculated that ''Archaeopteryx'' and the kiwi had similar [[metabolism]]s.&lt;ref name=Erickson_etal_2009/&gt;

===Daily activity patterns===
Comparisons between the [[sclerotic ring|scleral ring]]s of ''Archaeopteryx'' and modern birds and reptiles indicate that it may have been [[Diurnality|diurnal]], similar to most modern birds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Schmitz, L.; Motani, R. |year=2011 |title=Nocturnality in Dinosaurs Inferred from Scleral Ring and Orbit Morphology |journal=Science |volume=in press |issue= |pages= |doi=10.1126/science.1200043}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Paleoecology==
The richness and diversity of the [[Solnhofen limestone]]s in which all specimens of ''Archaeopteryx'' have been found have shed light on an ancient Jurassic Bavaria strikingly different from the present day. The latitude was similar to [[Florida]], though the climate was likely to have been drier, as evidenced by fossils of plants with adaptations for arid conditions and lack of terrestrial sediments characteristic of rivers. Evidence of plants, though scarce, include [[cycad]]s and conifers while animals found include a large number of insects, small lizards, [[pterosaur]]s and ''[[Compsognathus]]''.&lt;ref name=Chiappe_07/&gt;

The excellent preservation of ''Archaeopteryx'' fossils and other terrestrial fossils found at [[Solnhofen]] indicates that they did not travel far before becoming preserved.&lt;ref name=Davis_1/&gt; The ''Archaeopteryx'' specimens found are likely therefore to have lived on the low islands surrounding the Solnhofen lagoon rather than been corpses that drifted in from farther away. ''Archaeopteryx'' skeletons are considerably less numerous in the deposits of Solnhofen than those of pterosaurs, of which seven genera have been found.&lt;ref name=Bartell_90/&gt; The pterosaurs included such as ''[[Rhamphorhynchus (pterosaur)|Rhamphorhynchus]]'', the group which dominated the [[Ecological niche|niche]] currently occupied by [[seabird]]s, and which became extinct at the end of the Jurassic. The pterosaurs, which also included ''[[Pterodactylus]]'', were common enough that it is unlikely that the specimens found are [[Vagrancy (biology)|vagrants]] from the larger islands 50&amp;nbsp;km (31 miles) to the north.&lt;ref name=Paul_1/&gt;

The islands that surrounded the Solnhofen lagoon were low lying, [[semi-arid]] and sub-[[tropical]] with a long [[dry season]] and little rain.&lt;ref name=Buison/&gt; The closest modern analogue for the Solnhofen conditions is said to be [[Orca Basin]] in the northern [[Gulf of Mexico]], though that is much deeper than the Solnhofen lagoons.&lt;ref name=Bartell_90/&gt; The [[flora]] of these islands was adapted to these dry conditions and consisted mostly of low (3&amp;nbsp;m [10&amp;nbsp;ft]) shrubs.&lt;ref name=Paul_1/&gt; Contrary to reconstructions of ''Archaeopteryx'' climbing large trees, these seem to have been mostly absent from the islands; few trunks have been found in the sediments and fossilized tree [[pollen]] is also absent. 

The lifestyle of ''Archaeopteryx'' is difficult to reconstruct and there are several theories regarding it. Some researchers suggest that it was primarily adapted to life on the ground,&lt;ref name=Ostrom_3/&gt; while other researchers suggest that it was principally arboreal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Feduc 1&quot;/&gt; The absence of trees does not preclude ''Archaeopteryx'' from an arboreal lifestyle; several species of extant bird live exclusively in low shrubs. Various aspects of the morphology of ''Archaeopteryx'' point to either an arboreal or ground existence, the length of its legs, the elongation in its feet; and some authorities consider it likely to have been a generalist capable of feeding in both shrubs, open ground and even alongside the shores of the lagoon.&lt;ref name=Paul_1/&gt;  It most likely hunted small prey, seizing it with its jaws if it was small enough or with its claws if it was larger.

== History of discovery ==
[[Image:Archaeopteryx timeline.svg|thumb|400px|right|Timeline of ''Archaeopteryx'' discoveries. (Click to enlarge)]]
Over the years, ten body fossil specimens of ''Archaeopteryx'' and a feather that may belong to it have been found. All of the fossils come from the [[limestone]] deposits, quarried for centuries, near [[Solnhofen]], [[Germany]].&lt;ref name=Chiappe_07/&gt;&lt;ref name=Natgeo1/&gt;
[[Image:Archaeopteryx (Feather).jpg|left|upright|thumb|The single feather]]
The initial discovery, a single feather, was unearthed in 1860 or 1861 and described in 1861 by [[Christian Erich Hermann von Meyer]]. It is currently located at the [[Museum f√ºr Naturkunde|Humboldt Museum f√ºr Naturkunde]] in [[Berlin]]. This is generally assigned to ''Archaeopteryx'' and was the initial [[holotype]], but whether it actually is a feather of this species or another, as yet undiscovered, proto-bird is unknown. There are some indications it is indeed not from the same animal as most of the skeletons (the &quot;typical&quot; ''A. lithographica'').&lt;ref name=Griffiths/&gt;

The first skeleton, known as the '''London Specimen''' (BMNH 37001),&lt;ref name=BMNH_37001/&gt; was unearthed in 1861 near [[Langenaltheim]], Germany and perhaps given to a local physician Karl H√§berlein in return for medical services. He then sold it for ¬£700 to the [[Natural History Museum]] in London, where it remains.&lt;ref name=Chiappe_07/&gt; Missing most of its head and neck, it was described in 1863 by [[Richard Owen]] as ''Archaeopteryx macrura'', allowing for the possibility it did not belong to the same species as the feather. In the subsequent 4th edition of his ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'',&lt;ref name=Darwin_1/&gt; [[Charles Darwin]] described how some authors had maintained &quot;that the whole class of birds came suddenly into existence during the [[eocene]] period; but now we know, on the authority of Professor Owen, that a bird certainly lived during the deposition of the upper greensand; and still more recently, that strange bird, the Archeopteryx, with a long lizard-like tail, bearing a pair of feathers on each joint, and with its wings furnished with two free claws, has been discovered in the [[Oolite|oolitic]] [[slate]]s of [[Solnhofen]]. Hardly any recent discovery shows more forcibly than this how little we as yet know of the former inhabitants of the world.&quot;&lt;ref name=Darwin_2/&gt;
[[Image:Archaeopteryx lithographica, replica of London specimen, Staatliches Museum f√ºr Naturkunde Karlsruhe, Germany - 20100925.jpg|upright|thumb|Replica of the London ''Archaeopteryx''.]]
The [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] term &quot;pteryx&quot; (œÄœÑŒ≠œÅœÖŒæ) primarily means &quot;wing&quot;, but can also designate merely &quot;feather&quot;. Von Meyer suggested this in his description. At first he referred to a single feather which appeared like a modern bird's [[Flight feather|remex]] (wing feather), but he had heard of and been shown a rough sketch of the London specimen, to which he referred as a &quot;''Skelet eines mit √§hnlichen Federn bedeckten {{lang|deu|Thieres}}''&quot; (&quot;skeleton of an animal covered in similar feathers&quot;). In German, this ambiguity is resolved by the term ''Schwinge'' which does not necessarily mean a wing used for flying. ''Urschwinge'' was the favored translation of ''Archaeopteryx'' among German scholars in the late 19th century. In English, &quot;ancient pinion&quot; offers a rough approximation.

Since then nine specimens have been recovered:

The '''Berlin Specimen''' (HMN 1880) was discovered in 1874 or 1875 on the Blumenberg near [[Eichst√§tt]], Germany, by farmer Jakob Niemeyer. He sold this precious [[fossil]] for the money to buy a cow in 1876, to inn-keeper Johann D√∂rr, who again sold it to Ernst Otto H√§berlein, the son of K. H√§berlein. Placed on sale between 1877 and 1881, with potential buyers including [[Othniel Charles Marsh|O.C. Marsh]] of Yale University's Peabody Museum, it was eventually bought by the Humboldt Museum f√ºr Naturkunde, where it is now displayed, for 20,000 [[Goldmark]]. The transaction was financed by [[Ernst Werner von Siemens]], founder of the [[Siemens AG|famous company]] that bears his name.&lt;ref name=Chiappe_07/&gt; Described in 1884 by [[Wilhelm Dames]], it is the most complete specimen, and the first with a complete head. It was in 1897 named by Dames as a new species, ''A. siemensii''; a recent evaluation supports the ''A. siemensii'' species identification.&lt;ref name=Elzanowski2002/&gt;
[[Image:Archaeopteryx lithographica (Cast of Maxberg Specimen).jpg|upright|left|thumb|Cast of the Maxberg Specimen]] 
Composed of a torso, the '''[[Maxberg specimen|Maxberg Specimen]]''' (S5) was discovered in 1956 near Langenaltheim; it was brought to the attention of professor [[Florian Heller]] in 1958 and described by him in 1959. It is currently missing, though it was once exhibited at the [[Maxberg Museum]] in Solnhofen. It belonged to [[Eduard Opitsch]], who loaned it to the museum until 1974. After his death in 1991, the specimen was discovered to be missing and may have been stolen or sold. The specimen is missing its head and tail, although the rest of the skeleton is mostly intact.
[[Image:ArchaeopteryxHaarlem.JPG|thumb|Slab of the Haarlem Specimen]] 
The '''Haarlem Specimen''' (TM 6428, also known as the ''Teyler Specimen'') was discovered in 1855 near [[Riedenburg]], Germany and described as a ''[[Pterodactylus]] crassipes'' in 1877 by von Meyer. It was reclassified in 1970 by [[John Ostrom]] and is currently located at the [[Teylers Museum]] in [[Haarlem]], the Netherlands. It was the very first specimen, despite the classification error. It is also one of the least complete specimens, consisting mostly of limb bones and isolated cervical vertebrae and ribs.

The '''Eichst√§tt Specimen''' (JM 2257) was discovered in 1951 near Workerszell, Germany and described by [[Peter Wellnhofer]] in 1974. Currently located at the [[Jura Museum]] in [[Eichst√§tt]], Germany, it is the smallest specimen and has the second best head. It is possibly a separate genus (''Jurapteryx recurva'') or species (''A. recurva'').

The '''Solnhofen Specimen''' (BSP 1999) was discovered in the 1970s near [[Eichst√§tt]], Germany and described in 1988 by Wellnhofer. Currently located at the [[B√ºrgermeister-M√ºller-Museum]] in Solnhofen, it was originally classified as ''[[Compsognathus]]'' by an amateur collector, the same burgomaster Friedrich M√ºller after which the museum is named. It is the largest specimen known and may belong to a separate genus and species, ''[[Wellnhoferia]] grandis''. It is missing only portions of the neck, tail, backbone, and head.
[[Image:Archaeopteryx bavarica Detail.jpg|thumb|left|The Munich Specimen]]
The '''Munich Specimen''' (S6, formerly known as the ''Solnhofen-Aktien-Verein Specimen'') was discovered on 3 August 1992 near Langenaltheim and described in 1993 by Wellnhofer. It is currently located at the [[Pal√§ontologisches Museum M√ºnchen]] in [[Munich]], to which it was sold in 1999 for 1.9 million [[Deutschmark]]. What was initially believed to be a bony [[sternum]] turned out to be part of the [[coracoid]],&lt;ref name=Wellnhofer/&gt; but a [[cartilaginous]] sternum may have been present. Only the front of its face is missing. It may be a new species, ''A. bavarica''.
[[Image:Archaeopteryx (Daiting Specimen).jpg|thumb|Daiting Specimen]]
An eighth, fragmentary specimen was discovered in 1990, not in Solnhofen limestone, but in somewhat younger sediments at [[Daiting]], Suevia. It is therefore known as the '''Daiting Specimen''', and had been known since 1996 only from a cast, briefly shown at the ''Naturkundemuseum'' in [[Bamberg]]. Long remaining hidden and therefore dubbed the 'Phantom', the original was purchased by palaeontologist Raimund Albertsd√∂rfer in 2009.&lt;ref name=Sensation/&gt; It was on display for the first time with six other original fossils of ''Archaeopteryx'' at the ''Munich Mineral Show'' in October 2009.&lt;ref name=Sammler/&gt; A first, quick look by scientists indicates that this specimen might represent a new species of ''Archaeopteryx''.&lt;ref name=Wiedergefundener/&gt; It was found in a limestone bed that was a few hundred thousand years younger than the other finds.&lt;ref name=Sensation/&gt;
[[Image:Archaeopteryx (Chicken Wing).jpg|thumb|left|B√ºrgermeister-M√ºller (&quot;chicken wing&quot;) Specimen]] 
Another fragmentary fossil was found in 2000. It is in private possession and since 2004 on loan to the B√ºrgermeister-M√ºller Museum in Solenhofen, so it is called the '''B√ºrgermeister-M√ºller Specimen'''; the institute itself officially refers to it as the &quot;Exemplar of the families Ottman &amp; Steil, Solnhofen&quot;. As the fragment represents the remains of a single wing of ''Archaeopteryx'', the popular name of this fossil is &quot;chicken wing&quot;.

Long in a private collection in Switzerland, the '''Thermopolis Specimen''' (WDC CSG 100) was discovered in Bavaria and described in 2005 by Mayr, Pohl, and Peters. Donated to the [[Wyoming Dinosaur Center]] in [[Thermopolis, Wyoming]], it has the best-preserved head and feet; most of the neck and the lower jaw have not been preserved. The &quot;Thermopolis&quot; specimen was described in the December 2, 2005 ''Science'' journal article as &quot;A well-preserved ''Archaeopteryx'' specimen with theropod features&quot;; it shows that the ''Archaeopteryx'' lacked a reversed toe ‚Äî a universal feature of birds ‚Äî limiting its ability to perch on branches and implying a terrestrial or trunk-climbing lifestyle.&lt;ref name=Mayr_1/&gt; This has been interpreted as evidence of [[Theropoda|theropod]] ancestry. The specimen also has a hyperextendible second toe. &quot;Until now, the feature was thought to belong only to the species' close relatives, the [[Deinonychosauria|deinonychosaurs]].&quot;&lt;ref name=Natgeo2/&gt; In 1988, [[Gregory S. Paul]] claimed to have found evidence of a hyperextensible toe, but this was not verified and accepted by other scientists until the Thermopolis specimen was described.&lt;ref name=Paul_1988/&gt;
[[Image:Archaeopterix ka03.jpg|thumb|The Thermopolis Specimen]]
This tenth and latest specimen was assigned to ''Archaeopteryx siemensii'' in 2007.&lt;ref name=10th_find/&gt; The specimen itself, currently on loan to the [[Royal Tyrrell Museum]], [[Drumheller]], [[Alberta]], Canada, is considered the most complete and well preserved ''Archaeopteryx'' remains yet.&lt;ref name=10th_find/&gt;

=== Taxonomy ===
Today, the fossils are usually assigned to a single species ''A. lithographica'', but the taxonomic history is complicated. Dozens of names have been published for the handful of specimens, most of which are simply spelling errors (''lapsus''). As interpreted today, the name ''A. lithographica'' only referred to the single feather described by [[Christian Erich Hermann von Meyer|von Meyer]]. In 1954 however, [[Gavin de Beer]] concluded that the London specimen was the [[holotype]]. In 1960, Swinton accordingly proposed that the name ''Archaeopteryx lithographica'' be placed on the official genera list making the alternative names ''Griphosaurus'' and ''Griphornis'' invalid.&lt;ref name=Swinton/&gt; The ICZN, implicitly accepting de Beer's standpoint, did indeed suppress the plethora of alternative names initially proposed for the first skeleton specimens,&lt;ref name=ICZN_1961/&gt; which mainly resulted from the acrimonious dispute between von Meyer and his opponent [[Johann Andreas Wagner]] (whose ''Griphosaurus problematicus''‚Äî&quot;problematic [[riddle]]-lizard&quot;‚Äîwas a vitriolic sneer at von Meyer's ''Archaeopteryx'').&lt;ref name=Wagner_1/&gt; In addition, in 1977 the first specific name of the Haarlem specimen, ''crassipes'', described by von Meyer as a [[pterosaur]] before its true nature was realized, was also suppressed.&lt;ref name=UCal_MoP/&gt;&lt;ref name=ICZN_1977/&gt;
[[Image:Archaeopteryx lithographica (Eichst√§tter Specimen).jpg|thumb|left|Eichst√§tt Specimen, once considered a distinct genus, ''Jurapteryx'']] 
The relationships of the  specimens are problematic.  Most subsequent specimens have been given their own species at one point or another.  The Berlin specimen has been designated as ''Archaeornis siemensii'', the Eichst√§tt specimen as ''Jurapteryx recurva'', the Munich specimen as ''Archaeopteryx bavarica'' and the Solnhofen specimen was designated as ''Wellnhoferia grandis''. 
[[Image:Archaeopteryx lithographica (Solenhofener Specimen).jpg|thumb|upright|The Solnhofen Specimen, by some considered as belonging to the genus ''Wellnhoferia'']] 
Recently, it has been argued that all the specimens belong to the same species.&lt;ref name=New_Scientist_1/&gt; However, significant differences exist among the specimens. In particular, the Munich, Eichst√§tt, Solnhofen and Thermopolis specimens differ from the London, Berlin, and Haarlem specimens in being smaller or much larger, having different finger proportions, having more slender snouts, lined with forward-pointing teeth and possible presence of a sternum. These differences are as large as or larger than the differences seen today between adults of different bird species. However, it is also possible that these differences could be explained by different ages of the living birds.

Finally, it has been noted that the feather, the first specimen of ''Archaeopteryx'' described, does not agree well with the flight-related feathers of ''Archaeopteryx''.  It certainly is a [[flight feather]] of a contemporary species, but its size and proportions indicate that it may belong to another, smaller species of [[feathered dinosaur|feathered theropod]], of which only this feather is so far known.&lt;ref name=Griffiths/&gt;  As the feather is now seen as the [[Biological type|type specimen]], this would create significant [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature|nomenclatorial]] confusion because the name ''Archaeopteryx'' should then no longer be applied to the skeletons. In 2007, two sets of scientists therefore petitioned the [[International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature|ICZN]] requesting that the London specimen be explicitly made the type by designating it as the new holotype specimen, or [[neotype]].&lt;ref name=icznneotype&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bock | first1 = W.J. | last2 = B√ºhler | first2 = P. | year = 2007 | title = ''Archaeopteryx lithographica'' von Meyer, 1861 (Aves): proposed conservation of usage by designation of a neotype | url = http://iczn.org/content/archaeopteryx-lithographica-von-meyer-1861-aves-proposed-conservation-usage-designation-neot | journal = Bulletin of Zoological Nomenclature | volume = 64 | issue = 4| pages = 261‚Äì262 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversies ==
=== Authenticity ===
Beginning in 1985, a group including [[astronomer]] [[Fred Hoyle]] and [[physicist]] [[Lee Spetner]] published a series of papers claiming that the feathers on the Berlin and London specimens of ''Archaeopteryx'' were forged.&lt;ref name=Hoyle_85/&gt;&lt;ref name=RSW_85a/&gt;&lt;ref name=RSW_85b/&gt;&lt;ref name=RSW_85c/&gt; Their claims were repudiated by [[Alan J. Charig]] and others at the [[British Museum (Natural History)]].&lt;ref name=ACetal86/&gt; Most of their evidence for a forgery was based on unfamiliarity with the processes of [[lithification]]; for example, they proposed that based on the difference in texture associated with the feathers, feather impressions were applied to a thin layer of [[cement]],&lt;ref name=RSW_85a/&gt; without realizing that feathers themselves would have caused a textural difference.&lt;ref name=ACetal86/&gt; They also expressed disbelief that slabs would split so smoothly, or that one half of a slab containing fossils would have good preservation, but not the [[counterslab]].&lt;ref name=Hoyle_85/&gt;&lt;ref name=RSW_85b/&gt; These, though, are common properties of Solnhofen fossils because the dead animals would fall onto hardened surfaces which would form a natural plane for the future slabs to split along, leaving the bulk of the fossil on one side and little on the other.&lt;ref name=ACetal86/&gt; They also misinterpreted the fossils, claiming that the tail was forged as one large feather,&lt;ref name=RSW_85a/&gt; when this is visibly not the case.&lt;ref name=ACetal86/&gt; In addition, they claimed that the other specimens of ''Archaeopteryx'' known at the time did not have feathers,&lt;ref name=Hoyle_85/&gt;&lt;ref name=RSW_85a/&gt; which is untrue; the Maxberg and Eichst√§tt specimens have obvious feathers.&lt;ref name=ACetal86/&gt; Finally, the motives they suggested for a forgery are not strong, and contradictory; one is that [[Richard Owen]] wanted to forge evidence in support of [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of [[evolution]], which is unlikely given Owen's views toward Darwin and his theory. The other is that Owen wanted to set a trap for Darwin, hoping the latter would support the fossils so Owen could discredit him with the forgery; this is unlikely because Owen himself wrote a detailed paper on the London specimen, so such an action would certainly backfire.&lt;ref name=Talk_Origin_1/&gt;

Charig ''et al.'' pointed to the presence of hairline cracks in the slabs running through both rock and fossil impressions, and mineral growth over the slabs that had occurred before discovery and preparation, as evidence that the feathers were original.&lt;ref name=ACetal86/&gt; Spetner ''et al.'' then attempted to show that the cracks would have naturally propagated through their postulated cement layer,&lt;ref name=LMS88/&gt; but neglected to account for the fact that the cracks were old and had been filled with [[calcite]], and thus were not able to propagate.&lt;ref name=Talk_Origin_1/&gt; They also attempted to show the presence of cement on the London specimen through [[X-ray spectroscopy]], and did find something that was not rock.&lt;ref name=LMS88/&gt; However, it was not cement, either, and is most probably from a fragment of silicone rubber left behind when molds were made of the specimen.&lt;ref name=Talk_Origin_1/&gt; Their suggestions have not been taken seriously by palaeontologists, as their evidence was largely based on misunderstandings of geology, and they never discussed the other feather-bearing specimens, which have increased in number since then.  Charig ''et al.'' reported a discoloration: a dark band between two layers of limestone ‚Äì however, they say it is the product of sedimentation.&lt;ref name=ACetal86/&gt;  It is natural for limestone to take on the color of its surroundings and most limestones are colored (if not color banded) to some degree&lt;ref name=Encarta/&gt; ‚Äì the darkness was attributed to such impurities.  They also mention that a complete absence of air bubbles in the rock slabs is further proof that the specimen is authentic.&lt;ref name=ACetal86/&gt;

=== ''Archaeopteryx'' and ''Protoavis'' ===
In 1984, [[Sankar Chatterjee]] discovered fossils which he claimed in 1991 belonged to a fossil bird far older than ''Archaeopteryx''.  These fossils, believed to be around 210 to 225 million years old, have been assigned the name ''[[Protoavis]]''.&lt;ref name=Chatterjee91/&gt; The fossils are too badly preserved to allow an estimate of flying ability; although Chatterjee's reconstructions usually show feathers, many paleontologists, including Paul (2002) and Witmer (2002) have rejected the claims that ''Protoavis'' was an earlier bird (or, alternatively, that it existed at all).&lt;ref name=Paul_1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Witmer02/&gt; The fossils were found disarticulated, and were collected from different locations. Because the fossils are in poor condition, ''Archaeopteryx'' remains the earliest universally recognized bird.&lt;ref name=Ostrom96/&gt;

=== Phylogenetic position ===
Modern paleontology has consistently placed ''Archaeopteryx'' as the most primitive bird. It is not thought to be a true ancestor of modern birds but, rather, a close relative of that ancestor (see [[Avialae]] and [[Aves]]).&lt;ref name=Clarke&amp;Norell2002/&gt; Nonetheless, ''Archaeopteryx'' is so often used as a model of the true ancestral bird that it has seemed almost heretical to suggest otherwise. Several authors have done so.&lt;ref name=Witmer02/&gt; Lowe (1935)&lt;ref name=Lowe_1935/&gt; and Thulborn (1984)&lt;ref name=Thulborn_1984/&gt; questioned whether ''Archaeopteryx'' truly was the first bird. They suggested that ''Archaeopteryx'' was a dinosaur that was no more closely related to birds than were other dinosaur groups. Kurzanov (1987) suggested that ''[[Avimimus]]'' was more likely to be the ancestor of all birds than ''Archaeopteryx''.&lt;ref name=Kurzanov_1987/&gt; Barsbold (1983)&lt;ref name=Barsbold_1983/&gt; and Zweers and Van den Berge (1997)&lt;ref name=Zweers&amp;VandenBerge1997/&gt; noted that many [[maniraptora]]n lineages are extremely birdlike, and suggested that different groups of birds may have descended from different dinosaur ancestors.

== In popular culture ==
[[File:Archeopteryx color.jpg|thumb|Historical painting of ''Archaeopteryx'' by [[Heinrich Harder]], from around 1916]]
''Archaeopteryx'' is the best known early bird and has thus received widespread attention. Its easily recognizable appearance and the intense public interest in dinosaurs have caused ''Archaeopteryx'' to become a feature of worldwide popular culture.

A [[main belt]] [[asteroid]] discovered in 1991, [[9860 &lt;!--no italics here--&gt;Archaeopteryx&lt;!--no italics here--&gt;]], was named in honour of the genus.&lt;ref name=Small_JPL/&gt;&lt;ref name=Williams/&gt;

In one of the &quot;strangest&quot; appearances of ''Archaeopteryx'' in popular culture, [[Alfred Jarry|Alfred Jarry's]] 1897 play {{lang|fr|''Ubu cocu, ou l'Arch√©opteryx''}} ('Ubu cuckolded, or the Archaeopteryx') includes an ''Archaeopteryx'' as an important character.&lt;ref name=Buffetaut_85/&gt; 

The second book in the ''[[Time Machine (novel series)|Time Machine]]'' series, ''Search for Dinosaurs'', takes the reader on a journey to the Mesozoic to find and [[photograph]] an ''Archaeopteryx''.&lt;ref name=Bischoff/&gt;

'''Arthur Laurents''' (July 14, 1917&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; May 5, 2011) was an [[people of the United States|American]] playwright, stage director and screenwriter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/culture-obituaries/dance-obituaries/8498850/Arthur-Laurents.html &quot;Obituaries: Arthur Laurents&quot;].  ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''.  May 6, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

After writing scripts for radio shows after college and then [[training film]]s for the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] during [[World War II]], Laurents turned to writing for [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], producing a body of work that includes ''[[West Side Story]]'' (1957), ''[[Gypsy: A Musical Fable|Gypsy]]'' (1959), ''[[Hallelujah, Baby!]]'' (1967) and ''[[La Cage aux Folles (musical)|La Cage Aux Folles]]'' (1983), and directing some of his own shows and other Broadway productions.

His early film scripts include ''[[Rope (film)|Rope]]'' (1948) for [[Alfred Hitchcock]], followed by ''[[Anastasia (1956 film)|Anastasia]]'' (1956), ''[[Bonjour Tristesse (film)|Bonjour Tristesse]]'' (1958), ''[[The Way We Were]]'' (1973) and ''[[The Turning Point (1977 film)|The Turning Point]]'' (1977).

==Early life==
Born '''Arthur Levine''',&lt;ref name=Mag&gt;[http://nymag.com/arts/theater/profiles/55341/index3.html &quot;When You‚Äôre a Shark You‚Äôre a Shark All the Way&quot;].  ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Laurents was the son of a lawyer and a schoolteacher who gave up her career when she married.  He was born and raised in the [[Flatbush, Brooklyn|Flatbush]] section of [[Brooklyn]], a [[borough (New York City)|borough]] of [[New York City]], [[New York]], the elder of two children, and attended [[Erasmus Hall High School]].&lt;ref&gt;Hutchinson, Bill (May 6, 2011). [http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/music/2011/05/06/2011-05-06_playwright_behind_west_side_story_and_gypsy_arthur_laurents_dies_at_age_93.html &quot;Playwright Behind 'West Side Story' and 'Gypsy,' Arthur Laurents, Dies at Age 93&quot;].  ''[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bloomberg&gt;Arnold, Laurence (May 5, 2011). [http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-05-06/arthur-laurents-writer-of-west-side-story-gypsy-scripts-dies-at-93.html &quot;Arthur Laurents, Writer of 'West Side Story,' 'Gypsy' Scripts, Dies at 93&quot;].  [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg News]].&lt;/ref&gt; His sister Edith suffered from [[Chorea (disease)|chorea]] as a child.&lt;ref&gt;Laurents, Arthur. [http://books.google.com/books?id=0XbXeMf8LOsC&amp;pg=PA34&amp;lpg=PA34&amp;dq=Edith+%22Arthur+Laurents%22+sister&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=l7ARpmXyrt&amp;sig=Y7wzFDYnUxGoA4A5_PoEgzj2bww&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=Chorea&amp;f=false &quot;Beginnings&quot;] ''Original Story By Arthur Laurents: A Memoir of Broadway and Hollywood'', Hal Leonard Corporation, 2001, ISBN 1557834679, pp. 10&amp;ndash;11, 34&amp;ndash;35.&lt;/ref&gt;

His paternal grandparents were [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jews]], and his mother's parents, although born Jewish, were [[Atheism|atheists]]. His mother kept a [[Kashrut|kosher]] home for her husband's sake, but was lax about attending synagogue and observing the [[Jewish holiday]]s. His [[Bar and Bat Mitzvah|Bar Mitzvah]] marked the end of Laurents's religious education and the beginning of his rejection of all fundamentalist religions,&lt;ref&gt;Laurents, Arthur. ''Original Story By''. New York: Alfred A. Knopf (2000). ISBN 0-375-40055-9, pp. 6&amp;ndash;7.&lt;/ref&gt; although he continued to identify himself as Jewish.&lt;ref&gt;Laurents, p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; However, late in life he admitted to having changed his last name from Levine to the less Jewish-sounding Laurents, &quot;to get a job.&quot;&lt;ref name=Mag /&gt; 

After graduating from [[Cornell University]], Laurents took an evening class in [[radio]] writing at [[New York University]]. His instructor, a [[CBS Radio]] director/producer, submitted his script ''Now Playing Tomorrow'', a comedic fantasy about [[clairvoyance]], to the network, and it was produced with [[Shirley Booth]] in the lead role. It was Laurents' first professional credit. The show's success led to him being hired to write scripts for various radio shows, among them ''[[Lux Radio Theater]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Laurents, pp. 12&amp;ndash;13.&lt;/ref&gt;  Laurents' career was interrupted when he was drafted into the U.S. Army in the middle of World War II. Through a series of clerical errors, he never saw battle, but instead was assigned to the U.S. Army Pictorial Service located in a [[Kaufman Astoria Studios|film studio]] in [[Astoria, Queens]], where he wrote [[training film]]s and met, among others, [[George Cukor]] and [[William Holden]]. He later was reassigned to write plays for ''Armed Service Force Presents'', a radio show that dramatized the contributions of all branches of the armed forces.&lt;ref&gt;Laurents, pp. 22&amp;ndash;28.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theatrical career==
Soon after being discharged from the Army, Laurents met ballerina [[Nora Kaye]], and the two became involved in an on-again, off-again romantic relationship. While Kaye was on tour with ''[[Fancy Free (ballet)|Fancy Free]]'', Laurents continued to write for the radio but was becoming discontented with the medium. At the urging of [[Martin Gabel]], he spent nine consecutive nights writing a play inspired by a photograph of [[GI (military)|GIs]] in a [[South West Pacific theatre of World War II|South Pacific]] [[jungle]].&lt;ref&gt;Laurents, pp. 41&amp;ndash;49.&lt;/ref&gt; The result was ''Home of the Brave'', a drama about [[anti-semitism]] in the military, which opened on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] on December 27, 1945, and ran for 69 performances. [[Stanley Kramer]] filmed the ''[[Home of the Brave (1949 film)|Home of the Brave]]'' in 1949 changing the character from Jewish to black.

Five years later, his second Broadway production, ''The Bird Cage'', was even less successful, running for only 21 performances. In 1952, ''[[The Time of the Cuckoo]]'' reunited him with Shirley Booth and ran for 263 performances.  Laurents later would adapt it for the 1965 [[musical theatre|musical]] ''[[Do I Hear a Waltz?]]''  Other successes in the 1950s included the books for ''[[West Side Story (musical)|West Side Story]]'' (1957) and ''[[Gypsy (musical)|Gypsy]]'' (1959).

In 1962, Laurents directed ''[[I Can Get It for You Wholesale]]'', which helped to turn then-unknown [[Barbra Streisand]] into a star. His next project was ''[[Anyone Can Whistle]]'', which he directed and for which he wrote the book, but it proved to be an infamous flop. He later had success with the musicals ''[[Hallelujah, Baby!]]'' (written for [[Lena Horne]]&lt;ref&gt;Laurents, p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; but ultimately starring [[Leslie Uggams]]) and ''[[La Cage aux Folles (musical)|La Cage Aux Folles]]'' (1983), but ''[[Nick &amp; Nora]]'' was another flop.

In 2008, Laurents directed a Broadway revival of ''Gypsy'' starring [[Patti LuPone]], and in 2009, he tackled a bilingual revival of ''West Side Story'', with Spanish translations to some dialogue and lyrics by [[Lin-Manuel Miranda]]. While preparing the show, he noted, &quot;The musical theatre and cultural conventions of 1957 made it next to impossible for the characters to have authenticity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Kenneth (July 16, 2008). [http://www.playbill.com/news/article/119539.html &quot;'West Side Story', This Time With Bilingual Approach, Will Return to Broadway in February 2009&quot;].  ''[[Playbill]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the production's March 19 opening at the [[Palace Theatre (Broadway)|Palace Theatre]], [[Ben Brantley]] of the ''[[New York Times]]'' called the translations &quot;an only partly successful experiment&quot; and added, &quot;Mr. Laurents has exchanged insolence for innocence and, as with most such bargains, there are dividends and losses.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Brantley, Ben (March 20, 2009). [http://theater2.nytimes.com/2009/03/20/theater/reviews/20west.html &quot;Our Gangs&quot;].  ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film career==
Laurents' first Hollywood experience proved to be a frustrating disappointment. Unhappy with the script for ''[[The Snake Pit]]'' (1948), submitted by [[Frank Partos]] and [[Millen Brand]], director [[Anatole Litvak]] hired Laurents to rewrite it. Partos and Brand later insisted the bulk of the shooting script was theirs, and produced carbon copies of many of the pages Laurents actually had written to bolster their claim.  Having destroyed the original script and all his notes and rewritten pages after completing the project, Laurents had no way to prove most of the work was his, and the [[WGA screenwriting credit system|Writers Guild of America]] denied him screen credit. Brand later confessed he and Partos had copied scenes written by Laurents and apologized for his role in the deception. Four decades later, Laurents learned he was ineligible for WGA health benefits because he had failed to accumulate enough credits to qualify. He was short by one, the one he failed to get for ''The Snake Pit''.&lt;ref&gt;Laurents, pp. 106&amp;ndash;120.&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon hearing [[20th Century Fox]] executives were pleased with Laurents' work on ''The Snake Pit'', [[Alfred Hitchcock]] hired him for his next project, the film ''[[Rope (film)|Rope]]'' starring [[James Stewart (actor)|James Stewart]]. Hitchcock wanted Laurents to Americanize the British play ''[[Rope (play)|Rope]]'' (1929) by [[Patrick Hamilton (writer)|Patrick Hamilton]] for the screen. With his then-lover [[Farley Granger]] set to star, Laurents was happy to accept the assignment. His dilemma was how to make the audience aware of the fact the three main characters were [[homosexuality|homosexual]] without blatantly saying so. [[United States Motion Picture Production Code of 1930|The Hays Office]] kept close tabs on his work, and the final script was so discreet that Laurents was unsure whether co-star James Stewart ever realized that his character was gay.&lt;ref&gt;Laurents, pp. 115&amp;ndash;116, 124&amp;ndash;131.&lt;/ref&gt; In later years, Hitchcock asked him to script both ''[[Torn Curtain]]'' (1966) and ''[[Topaz (1969 film)|Topaz]]'' (1969), However, Laurents, in both cases unenthused by the material, declined the offers.&lt;ref&gt;Laurents, p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Laurents also scripted ''[[Anastasia (1956 film)|Anastasia]]'' (1956) and ''[[Bonjour Tristesse (film)|Bonjour Tristesse]]'' (1958). ''[[The Way We Were]]'' (1973), in which he incorporated many of his own experiences, particularly those with the HUAC, reunited him with Barbra Streisand, and ''[[The Turning Point (1977 film)|The Turning Point]]'' (1977), inspired in part by his love for Nora Kaye, was directed by her husband [[Herbert Ross]]. The Fox animated feature film ''[[Anastasia (1997 film)|Anastasia]]'' (1997) was based in part from his screenplay of the live-action 1956 film of the same title.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://forum.bcdb.com/forum/West_Side_Story_author_Arthur_Laurents_dies_93_P112699/ &quot;West Side Story Author Arthur Laurents Dies, 93&quot;] forum.bcdb.com.  May 4, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Blacklist==
Because of a casual remark made by [[Russel Crouse]], Laurents was called to [[Washington, D.C.]], to account for his political views.&lt;ref&gt;Laurents, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; He explained himself to the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]], and his appearance had no obvious impact on his career, which at the time was primarily in the theatre.  When the [[McCarran Internal Security Act]], which prohibited individuals suspected of engaging in subversive activities from obtaining a passport, was passed in 1950, Laurents and Granger immediately applied for and received passports and departed for Paris with [[Harold Clurman]] and his wife [[Stella Adler]]. Laurents and Granger remained abroad, traveling throughout Europe and northern Africa, for about 18 months.&lt;ref&gt;Laurents, pp. 165&amp;ndash;190.&lt;/ref&gt;

Years earlier, Laurents and [[Jerome Robbins]] had developed ''Look Ma, I'm Dancin'!'' (1948), a stage musical about the world of ballet that ran for 188 performances on Broadway, and starred [[Nancy Walker]] and [[Harold Lang]]. (Although the musical was ultimately produced with a book by [[Jerome Lawrence]] and [[Robert Edwin Lee|Robert E. Lee]], as Laurents left the project.)&lt;ref&gt;Vaill, Amanda (2006). ''Somewhere: The Life of Jerome Robbins'', Random House, Inc.  p. 135.  ISBN 0767904206.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=1648 &quot;'Look Ma, I'm Dancin' listing&quot;].  [[Internet Broadway Database]].&lt;/ref&gt; Robbins approached [[Paramount Pictures]] about directing a screen version, and the studio agreed as long as Laurents was not part of the package. 

It was not until then that Laurents learned he officially had been [[Hollywood blacklist|blacklisted]], primarily because a review of ''Home of the Brave'' had been published in the ''[[Daily Worker]]''. He decided to return to Paris, but the [[United States Department of State|State Department]] refused to renew his passport. Laurents spent three months trying to clear his name, and after submitting a lengthy letter explaining his political beliefs in detail, it was determined they were so [[Idiosyncrasy|idiosyncratic]] he couldn't have been a member of any subversive groups. Within a week his passport was renewed, and the following day he sailed for Europe on the ''[[SS Ile de France|Ile de France]]''. While on board, he received a cable from [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] offering him a screenwriting assignment. The blacklist had ended.&lt;ref&gt;Laurents, pp. 286&amp;ndash;289.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Memoirs==
Laurents wrote ''Original Story By Arthur Laurents: A Memoir of Broadway and Hollywood'', published in 2000. In it, he discusses his lengthy career and his many gay affairs and long-term relationships, including those with [[Farley Granger]] and Tom Hatcher. Hatcher was an aspiring actor whom [[Gore Vidal]] suggested Laurents seek out at the [[Beverly Hills]] men's clothing store Hatcher was managing at the time. The couple remained together for 52 years until Hatcher's death on October 26, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.backstage.com/bso/news_reviews/other_news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003345921 &quot;Backstage.com obituary, November 1, 2006&quot;].  ''[[Back Stage]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Laurents wrote ''Mainly on Directing: Gypsy, West Side Story and Other Musicals'', published in 2009, in which he discussed musicals he directed and the work of other directors he admired.

==Death==
Laurents died at the age of 93  in New York City on May 5, 2011 of pneumonia complications, as reported by ''[[The New York Times]]''. He had lived with his lover Tom Hatcher for more than fifty years, until Hatcher's death in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Berkvist, Robert (May 5, 2011). [http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/06/arts/arthur-laurents-playwright-and-director-dies-at-93.html &quot;Arthur Laurents, Playwright and Director on Broadway, Dies at 93&quot;]. ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Following a long tradition, Broadway theatre lights were dimmed at 8 p.m. on May 6, 2011, for one minute in his memory.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Kenneth (May 6, 2011).

{{Nihongo|'''''A.D. Police: Dead End City'''''|A.D.POLICE ÁµÇÁÑâÈÉΩÂ∏Ç|A.D.POLICE Shuuen Toshi}} is a [[manga|Japanese comic book]] [[limited series]] written by [[Toshimichi Suzuki]] and illustrated by [[Tony Takezaki]]. Its happenings are set between [[A.D. Police Files]] and [[Bubblegum Crisis]]. The story focuses on the members of the A.D. Police, an advanced group of officers tasked with stopping [[terrorism|terrorist]] activities and [[Boomer (Bubblegum Crisis)|Boomer]] crimes in the city of Mega Tokyo.

== Plot ==
The A.D. Police are an elite group of highly trained and specially equipped [[police]] officers, who have been formed to deal with [[terrorism|terrorist]] activities and Boomer crimes in the city of Mega Tokyo. They are more heavily armed and equipped (including power armors like the K-11 and K-12) for a normal police force, but too lightly for a military organization.

The A.D. Police are offered a great deal of leeway in their activities, often blockading large sections of the city and causing great amounts of property damage in the course of fulfilling their duty. Despite their dedication to their jobs, however, the citizens of Mega Tokyo tend to dislike and distrust members of the A.D. Police, seeing them as corrupt and ineffectual.

'''Adrian Lamo''' is a [[Threat_(computer)#Threat_analysis|threat analyst]] and &quot;[[grey hat]]&quot; [[Hacker (computer security)|hacker]].  He first gained media attention for breaking into several high-profile computer networks, including those of ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Yahoo!]], and [[Microsoft]], culminating in his 2004 arrest.&lt;ref name=kahn&gt;[http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/12.04/hacker_pr.html Wired 12.04: The Homeless Hacker v. The New York Times]. Wired.com.

&lt;/ref&gt;  He spent his early childhood in [[Arlington, Virginia|Arlington]], [[Virginia]], until moving to [[Bogot√°, Colombia|Bogot√°]], [[Colombia]] around the age of 10. When his family moved back to the [[United States]] two years later, they settled in [[San Francisco]], where Adrian lived until he tested out of high school a year early. Popularly called the &quot;homeless hacker&quot; for his transient lifestyle, Lamo spent most of his travels [[CouchSurfing|couch-surfing]], squatting in abandoned buildings and traveling to [[Internet cafe]]s, libraries and universities to investigate networks, and sometimes exploiting security holes.&lt;ref name=kahn /&gt; Despite performing authorized and unauthorized [[vulnerability assessment]]s for several large, high-profile entities, Lamo refused to accept payment for his services. 

In the mid-1990s, Lamo became a volunteer for the gay and lesbian media firm [[PlanetOut.com]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/2002/03/50811?currentPage=1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/12.04/hacker_pr.html&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, Lamo was appointed to the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer and Questioning Youth Task Force by the [[San Francisco]] [[Board of Supervisors]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldtribune.com/worldtribune/WTARC/2010/ss_military0732_08_02.asp&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

During this period, in 2001, he overdosed on prescription amphetamines.&lt;ref name=&quot;mpalm03&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;jkahn04&quot;/&gt;

In a 2004 interview with ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'', an ex-girlfriend of Lamo's described him as &quot;very controlling,&quot; stating, &quot;He carried a [[electroshock weapon|stun gun]], which he used on me.&quot; According to the same article, a court issued a restraining order against Lamo.&lt;ref name=&quot;jkahn04&quot;&gt;

===Security compromise===
In February 2002 he broke into the internal computer network of ''The New York Times'', adding his name to the internal database of expert sources, and using the paper's [[LexisNexis]] account to conduct research on high-profile subjects. The Times filed a complaint, and a warrant for Lamo's arrest was issued in August 2003 following a 15 month investigation by federal prosecutors in New York. At 10:15 AM on September 9, after spending a few days in hiding, he surrendered to the [[United States Marshals Service|US Marshals]] in [[Sacramento, California]]. He re-surrendered to the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] in New York City on September 11, and pled guilty to one felony count of [[computer crime]]s against [[Microsoft]], [[LexisNexis]] and ''[[The New York Times]]'' on January 8, 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wired.com/techbiz/it/news/2004/01/61831  &quot;Adrian Lamo Cuts Deal With Feds&quot;], ''Wired.com'', January 9, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.securityfocus.com/news/7771  &quot;Lamo Pleads Guilty to Times Hack&quot;], ''SecurityFocus'', January 8, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Later in 2004, Lamo was sentenced to six months detention at his parents' home plus two years probation, and was ordered to pay roughly $65,000 in restitution. He was convicted of compromising security at ''[[The New York Times]]'' and [[Microsoft]],&lt;ref&gt;

When challenged for a response to allegations that he was glamorizing crime for the sake of publicity, his response was &quot;Anything I could say about my person or my actions would only cheapen what they have to say for themselves&quot;. When approached for comment during his criminal case, Lamo frustrated reporters with [[non sequitur (absurdism)|non sequiturs]] such as &quot;Faith manages&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;

===DNA controversy===
On May 9, 2006, while 18 months into a two year probation sentence, Adrian Lamo refused to give the [[United States government]] a blood sample they demanded so as to record his [[DNA]] in their [[Combined DNA Index System|CODIS]] system.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; According to his attorney, Adrian Lamo has a religious objection to giving blood, but is willing to give his DNA in another form. On June 15, 2007, lawyers for Lamo filed a motion citing the [[Book of Genesis]] as one basis for Lamo's religious opposition to the frivolous spilling of blood.

On June 21, 2007, it was reported that Lamo's legal counsel had reached a settlement agreement with the U.S. [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] granting Lamo's original request. According to [[Kevin Poulsen]]'s blog, &quot;the Justice Department formally settled the case, filing a joint stipulation along with Lamo's federal public defender dropping the demand for blood, and accepting cheek swabs instead.&quot; Reached for comment, Lamo reportedly affirmed to Poulsen his intention to &quot;comply vigorously&quot; with the order.&lt;ref&gt;

====Greenwald, Lamo, Wired Magazine====
Lamo's role in the Manning case drew the ire of [[Glenn Greenwald]], of Salon Magazine.  An ardent supporter of WikiLeaks, Greenwald has been a passionate critic of Lamo, suggesting that Lamo lied to Manning by turning him in, and also lied after the fact to cover up the circumstances of Manning's confessions.&lt;ref name=gg&gt;

Greenwald has called for Wired to release more of the chat logs in its possession that pertain to a conversation between Bradley Manning and Adrian Lamo:  &quot;there are clearly relevant parts of those chats which Wired continues to conceal&quot;.&lt;ref name=gg /&gt; Wired's editor-in-chief has reiterated that &quot;the logs include sensitive personal information with no bearing on WikiLeaks, and it would serve no purpose to publish them at this time.&quot;&lt;ref name=wiredgg /&gt; In an article entitled &quot;The Worsening Journalistic Disgrace at Wired&quot;, Greenwald claimed that Wired was &quot;actively conceal[ing] from the public, for months on end, the key evidence in a political story that has generated headlines around the world.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salon.com/news/opinion/glenn_greenwald/2010/12/27/wired The worsening journalistic disgrace at Wired ‚Äì Glenn Greenwald].

{{Politics of the United States}}
'''Associate Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States''' are the members of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] other than the [[Chief Justice of the United States]]. The number of Associate Justices is determined by the [[United States Congress]] and is currently set at eight by the [[Judiciary Act of 1869]].

Associate Justices, like the Chief Justice, are nominated by the [[President of the United States]] and are confirmed by the [[United States Senate]] by majority vote. This is provided for in [[Article Two of the United States Constitution|Article II]] of the Constitution, which states that the President &quot;shall nominate, and by and with the [[Advice and consent|Advice and Consent]] of the Senate, shall appoint...Judges of the supreme Court.&quot;

[[Article Three of the United States Constitution|Article III]] of the Constitution specifies that Associate Justices, and all other [[United States federal judge]]s &quot;shall hold their Offices during good Behavior.&quot; This language means that the appointments are effectively [[Life tenure|for life]], ending only when a Justice [[Death|dies]] in office, [[Retirement|retires]], or is removed from office following [[Impeachment in the United States|impeachment]] by the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and conviction by the Senate.&lt;ref name=&quot;recess&quot;&gt;[[Recess appointments]] are a notable exception. ''See U.S. v. Woodley'' 751 F.2d 1008, 10014; Recess appointments to the Supreme Court are exceptionally rare. Only two [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justices]] and six Associate Justices have received recess appointments, and only [[John Rutledge]] was not subsequently confirmed by the Senate. The last President to make a recess appointment to the Supreme Court was [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Each of the Justices of the Supreme Court has a single vote in deciding the cases argued before it; the Chief Justice's vote counts no more than that of any other Justice. However, in drafting opinions, the Chief Justice enjoys additional influence in case disposition if in the majority through his power to assign who writes the opinion. Otherwise, the senior justice in the majority assigns the writing of a decision. Furthermore, the Chief Justice leads the discussion of the case among the justices. The Chief Justice has certain administrative responsibilities that the other Justices do not and is paid slightly more ($223,500 per year for the Chief Justice and $213,900 per year for each Associate Justice&lt;ref name='wapo-salaries'&gt;{{Cite news| first= Robert| last= Barnes| coauthors= |authorlink= | title=Supreme Court Chief Justice Roberts opts not to ask Congress to raise judicial salaries | date=2010-01-01 | publisher= | url =http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/12/31/AR2009123102599.html | work =The Washington Post | pages = | accessdate = 2010-02-17 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;).

Associate Justices have seniority by order of appointment, although the Chief Justice is always considered to be the most senior. If two justices are appointed on the same day, the older is designated the senior Justice of the two. Currently, the senior Associate Justice is [[Antonin Scalia]]. By tradition, when the Justices are in conference deliberating the outcome of cases before the Court, the justices state their views in order of seniority. If there is a knock at their conference room door, the junior justice (who sits closest to the door) must answer it.

Under [[Title 28 of the United States Code|28 USC]] [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/3.html 3], when the Chief Justice is unable to discharge his functions, or that office is vacant, his duties are carried out by the most senior Associate Justice until the disability or the vacancy ends.

The current Associate Justices are (in order of seniority):
*[[Antonin Scalia]]
*[[Anthony Kennedy]]
*[[Clarence Thomas]]
*[[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]]
*[[Stephen Breyer]]
*[[Samuel Alito]]
*[[Sonia Sotomayor]]
*[[Elena Kagan]]

==Retired Associate Justices==
When a Justice retires, he or she usually goes into [[senior status]], which means that the Justice keeps his or her title, and may serve by assignment on panels of the  Federal [[U.S. Courts of Appeals|Circuit Courts of Appeal]]s (as [[Lewis F. Powell, Jr.]], did for several years). Retired Justices may choose to keep a chamber in the Supreme Court building, as well as to employ law clerks. The names of Retired Associate Justices continue to appear alongside the other active members on the Bound Volumes of Supreme Court decisions. However, Retired Associate Justices take no part in the consideration or decision of any cases before the Supreme Court.

Currently, there are three retired Associate Justices: [[Sandra Day O'Connor]], who assumed senior status on January 31, 2006, [[David H. Souter]], who assumed senior status on June 29, 2009, and [[John Paul Stevens]], who assumed senior status on June 29, 2010.

'''Alan Jay Lerner''' (August 31, 1918 &amp;ndash; June 14, 1986) was an [[United States|American]] [[lyricist]] and [[librettist]]. In collaboration with [[Frederick Loewe]], he created some of the world's most popular and enduring works of [[musical theatre]] for both the stage and on film. He won three [[Tony Award]]s and three [[Academy Award]]s, among other honors.

==Biography==
Born in [[New York City]], he was the son of Edith Adelson Lerner and Joseph Jay Lerner, whose brother, Samuel Alexander Lerner, was founder and owner of the [[Lerner Stores]], a chain of dress shops. One of Lerner's cousins was the radio comedian/television game show panelist [[Henry Morgan]]. Alan Jay Lerner was educated at [[Bedales School]] in England, [[Choate Rosemary Hall|The Choate School]] (now Choate Rosemary Hall) in Wallingford, Connecticut, (where he wrote &quot;The Choate Marching Song&quot;) and [[Harvard University|Harvard]]. He attended both [[Camp Androscoggin]] and [[Camp Greylock]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE7DC1E3AF937A25755C0A964958260 &quot;The Executive Life; And No One Mentions The Many Mosquitoes&quot;]''New York Times'', June 14, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; At both Choate and Harvard, Lerner was a classmate of [[John F. Kennedy]]; at Choate they had worked together on the yearbook staff.&lt;ref name=tcm&gt;[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/participant.jsp?spid=112326&amp;apid=8980  &quot;Alan Jay Lerner&quot; biography] tcm.com, accessed August 1, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  Like [[Cole Porter]] at [[Yale]] and [[Richard Rodgers]] at [[Columbia University|Columbia]], his career in musical theater began with his collegiate contributions, in Lerner's case to the annual Harvard [[Hasty Pudding Theatricals|Hasty Pudding]] musicals.&lt;ref&gt;Green, p.238&lt;/ref&gt; During the summers of 1936 and 1937, Lerner studied at [[Juilliard]]. While attending Harvard, he lost his sight in his left eye due to an accident in the boxing ring. In 1957, Lerner and [[Leonard Bernstein]], another of Lerner's college classmates, collaborated on &quot;Lonely Men of Harvard,&quot; a tongue-in-cheek salute to their alma mater.

Due to his injury, Lerner could not serve in [[World War II]]. Instead he wrote [[radio]] scripts, including ''[[Your Hit Parade]]'', until he was introduced to [[Austria]]n composer [[Frederick Loewe]], who needed a partner, in 1942 at the [[Lamb's Club]]. While at the Lamb's, he came upon [[Lorenz Hart]], and he helped transform Lerner into his protege. 

Lerner and Loewe's first collaboration was a musical adaptation of Barry Conners's farce ''The Patsy'' called ''Life of the Party'' for a [[Detroit]] [[Stock company (acting)|stock company]]. The lyrics were mostly written by Earle Crooker, but he had left the project, with the score needing vast improvement. It enjoyed a nine-week run and encouraged the duo to join forces with Arthur Pierson for ''[[What's Up? (musical)|What's Up?]]'', which opened on Broadway in 1943. It ran for 63 performances and was followed two years later by ''[[The Day Before Spring]]''. One of Broadway's most successful partnerships had been established.&lt;ref&gt;Green, p. 239&lt;/ref&gt;

Their first hit was ''[[Brigadoon (musical)|Brigadoon]]'' (1947), a romantic fantasy set in a mystical Scottish village, directed by [[Robert Lewis (actor)|Robert Lewis]]. It was followed in 1951 by the less successful [[California Gold Rush|Gold Rush]] story ''[[Paint Your Wagon (musical)|Paint Your Wagon]]''.

Lerner worked with [[Kurt Weill]] on the stage musical ''[[Love Life (musical)|Love Life]]'' (1948) and [[Burton Lane]] on the movie musical ''[[Royal Wedding]]'' (1951). In that same year Lerner also wrote the [[Academy Awards|Oscar-winning]] original [[screenplay]] for ''[[An American in Paris (Movie)|An American in Paris]]'', produced by [[Arthur Freed]] and directed by [[Vincente Minnelli]]. This was the same team who would later join with Lerner and Loewe to create ''[[Gigi (1958 film)|Gigi]]''.

In 1956, Lerner and Loewe unveiled ''[[My Fair Lady]]''. Before finishing the musical, Lerner was eager to write while ''My Fair Lady'' was taking so long to complete. [[Burton Lane]] and Lerner were working on a musical about [[Li'l Abner]]. [[Gabriel Pascal]] owned the rights to ''Pygmalion'', which had been unsuccessful with other composers who tried to adapt it into a musical. [[Arthur Schwartz]] and [[Howard Dietz]] first tried, and then [[Richard Rogers]] and [[Oscar Hammerstein II]] attempted, but gave up and Hammerstein told Lerner &quot;Pygmalion had no subplot&quot;. Their adaptation of [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s ''[[Pygmalion (play)|Pygmalion]]'' retained his social commentary and added appropriate songs for the characters of Henry Higgins and Liza Doolittle, played originally by [[Rex Harrison]] and [[Julie Andrews]]. It set box-office records in [[New York]] and [[London]]. When brought to the screen in 1964, the movie version would win eight [[Academy Awards|Oscars]], including Best Picture and Best Actor for [[Rex Harrison]].

Lerner and Loewe's run of success continued with their next project, a film adaptation of stories from [[Colette]], the [[Academy Award]] winning film musical ''[[Gigi (1958 film)|Gigi]]'', starring [[Leslie Caron]] , [[Louis Jourdan]] and [[Maurice Chevalier]]. The film won all of its nine Oscar nominations, a record at that point in time, and a special Oscar for co-star Maurice Chevalier. 

The Lerner-Loewe partnership cracked under the stress of producing the Arthurian ''[[Camelot (musical)|Camelot]]'' in 1960, with Loewe resisting Lerner's desire to direct as well as write when original director [[Moss Hart]] suffered a heart attack in the last few months of rehearsals, and would die shortly after the show's premiere. Lerner was hospitalized with [[bleeding ulcer]]s while Loewe continued to have heart troubles. ''Camelot'' was a hit nonetheless, with a poignant coda; immediately following the assassination of [[John F. Kennedy]], his widow told ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine that JFK's administration reminded her of the &quot;one brief shining moment&quot; of Lerner and Loewe's ''Camelot''. To this day, ''Camelot'' is invoked to describe the [[idealism]], [[Romance (genre)|romance]], and [[tragedy]] of the Kennedy years.

Loewe retired to [[Palm Springs, California]] while Lerner went through a series of unsuccessful musicals with such composers as [[Andr√© Previn]] (''[[Coco (musical)|Coco]]''), [[John Barry (composer)|John Barry]] (''[[Lolita, My Love]]''), [[Leonard Bernstein]] (''[[1600 Pennsylvania Avenue (musical)|1600 Pennsylvania Avenue]]''), [[Burton Lane]] (''[[Carmelina]]'') and [[Charles Strouse]] (''[[Dance a Little Closer]]'', based on the film, ''[[Idiot's Delight (film)|Idiot's Delight]]'', nicknamed ''Close A Little Faster'' by Broadway wags because it closed on opening night). Most biographers blame Lerner's professional decline on the lack of not only a strong composer but a strong director whom Lerner could collaborate with, as [[Neil Simon]] did with [[Mike Nichols]] or [[Stephen Sondheim]] with [[Harold Prince]] ([[Moss Hart]], who had directed ''[[My Fair Lady]],'' died shortly after ''[[Camelot (musical)|Camelot]]'' opened). In 1965 Lerner collaborated again with [[Burton Lane]] on the musical ''[[On a Clear Day You Can See Forever]]'', which was adapted for film in 1970. Lerner was inducted into the [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]] in 1971.

In 1973, Lerner coaxed Fritz Loewe out of retirement to augment the ''Gigi'' score for a [[Gigi (musical)|musical stage adaptation]]. The following year they collaborated on a musical film version of ''[[The Little Prince (film)|The Little Prince]]'', based on the classic children's tale by [[Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry]]. This film was a critical and box office failure, but has gained a modern following.

Lerner's autobiography ''The Street Where I Live'' (1978), was an account of three of his and Loewe's successful collaborations, ''My Fair Lady'', ''Gigi'', and ''Camelot'' along with personal information. In the last year of his life he published ''The Musical Theatre:  A Celebration'', a well-reviewed history of the theatre replete with personal anecdotes and his trademark wit. A book of Lerner's lyrics entitled ''A Hymn To Him'', edited by British writer [[Benny Green (saxophonist)|Benny Green]], was published in 1987. 

At the time of Lerner's death, he had just begun to write lyrics for ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1986 musical)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'', and was replaced by [[Charles Hart (lyricist)|Charles Hart]]. He also had been working with [[Gerard Kenny]] in London on a musical version of the classic film ''[[My Man Godfrey]]''. He received an urgent call from [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]] who wanted him to write the lyrics to ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1986 musical)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'', which he wrote ''[[Masquerade (song)|Masquerade]]''. He then informed Webber that he wanted to leave the project, as he was losing his memory (due to an undiagnosed brain tumor).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Furia|first=Philip|title=American Song Lyricists, 1920-1960|year=2002|publisher=Gale|location=Detroit|isbn=978-0-7876-6009-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

''The Complete Book of Les Mis√©rables'' (1993),Arcade Publishing, ISBN 1-55970-156-0, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;

After Lerner's death, ''Paul Blake'' made a musical revue based on Lerner's lyrics and life. ''Almost Like Being in Love'' featured music by [[Frederick Loewe]], [[Burton Lane]], [[Andre Previn]], [[Charles Strouse]], and [[Kurt Weill]]. The show ran for only 10 days at the [[Herbst Theatre]] in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]].

==Personal life==
Lerner's personal foibles were the stuff of tabloid legend. For nearly twenty years he battled an [[amphetamine]] [[Substance use disorder|addiction]]; during the 1960s he was a patient of the notorious [[Max Jacobson]], known as &quot;Dr. Feelgood&quot;, who administered injections of &quot;vitamins with enzymes&quot; that were in fact laced with amphetamines. Lerner's addiction is believed to have been the result of Jacobson's bizarre practice.&lt;ref&gt;Bryk, William.[http://www.nysun.com/out-and-about/dr-feelgood/20251/  &quot;Dr. Feelgood&quot;]''New York Sun'', September 20, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rasmussen, Nicolas. ''On speed'' (2008), NYU Press, ISBN 0-8147-7601-9, p. 169&lt;/ref&gt;

He married eight times: Ruth Boyd (1940&amp;ndash;1947), dancer [[Marion Bell]] (1947&amp;ndash;1949), [[Nancy Olson]] (1950&amp;ndash;1957), lawyer Micheline Muselli Pozzo di Borgo (1957&amp;ndash;1965), editor Karen Gunderson (1966&amp;ndash;1974), [[Sandra Payne]] (1974&amp;ndash;1976), Nina Bushkin (1977&amp;ndash;1981), and [[Liz Robertson]] (1981&amp;ndash;1986). Four of his eight wives  Olson, Payne, Bushkin, and Robertson, were actresses.&lt;ref name=tcm/&gt;
His seventh wife, Nina Bushkin, whom he married on May 30, 1977, was the director of development at [[Mannes College of Music]] and the daughter of composer and musician Joey Bushkin.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Note on People&quot;, ''The New York Times'', June 10, 1977, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; After their divorce in 1981, Lerner was ordered to pay her a settlement of $50,000.&lt;ref&gt;Lees, Gene. ''The musical worlds of Lerner and Loewe'', (2005), U of Nebraska Press, ISBN 0-8032-8040-8, p. 309&lt;/ref&gt;  Lerner wrote in his autobiography (as quoted by ''The New York Times''): &quot;All I can say is that if I had no flair for marriage, I also had no flair for bachelorhood.&quot;&lt;ref name=times&gt;Freedman, Samuel. ''New York Times'', &quot;Alan Jay Lerner, the Lyricist and Playwright, Is Dead at 67&quot; June 15, 1986, p.1&lt;/ref&gt; One of his ex-wives reportedly said, &quot;Marriage is Alan's way of saying goodbye.&quot;

The divorces cost him much of his wealth, but Lerner bears primary responsibility for his financial ups and downs, and was apparently less than truthful about his financial fecklessness.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Gordon W. ''Administration of wills, trusts, and estates '' (2002), Cengage Learning, ISBN 0-7668-5281-4, p. 358&lt;/ref&gt; One persistent fiction, widely publicized, was that his divorce settlement from Micheline Musseli Pozzo di Borgo (his fourth wife) cost him an estimated $1 million in 1965. This was a gross distortion of the truth.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Mrs. Lerner in Las Vegas Preparing to Ask Divorce&quot;, ''The New York Times'', September 1, 1965, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; It was also falsely reported that Ms. Musseli sent over US$500,000 to [[Switzerland]], but that was gossip given credence by newspaper items claiming that Loewe had warned his partner to not get romantically involved with a lawyer. The reality is that Micheline Musseli Pozzo di Borgo, a French aristocrat who at 20 was France's youngest lawyer ever, brought considerable wealth to her marriage to Lerner and lost most of it through him, including nearly $600,000 from the sale of her Parisian apartment, which Lerner placed in investments that either failed or were looted by him during periods of financial desperation. (Musseli told friends she had not wanted to sell her home, but that Lerner urged her to cut her ties with her native city and that she entrusted Lerner with the proceeds of the sale, for investment in the U.S.) The daughter of a World War One French war hero and herself an unsung heroine of the Resistance, whose Corsican forebears were intimates of Napoleon Bonaparte, she later made Lerner the gift of a chateau in France after he declared to her that he wanted a French rural retreat where he could write. That too was lost to Lerner's neglect of his finances. Some observers speculate that Alan Jay Lerner's pride was so badly bruised by Muselli's much-publicized rejection of him (due to his drug addiction and neglect of their son) that in revenge he portrayed her as a gold-digging spendthrift. Her actual settlement was said to be in the neighborhood of $80,000. Alan Jay Lerner's pattern of financial mismanagement continued until his death from cancer in 1986, when he reportedly owed the [[US Internal Revenue Service]] over US$1,000,000 in back taxes, and was unable to pay for his final medical expenses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/20/arts/alan-jay-lerner-sued-by-us-for-1.4-million.html &quot;Alan Jay Lerner Sued By U.S. for $1.4 Million&quot;]''New York Times'', February 20, 1986&lt;/ref&gt;  

Lerner died of [[lung cancer]] in [[Manhattan]] at the age of 67. At the time of his death he was married to actress [[Liz Robertson]],&lt;ref name=times/&gt; who was 36 years his junior.

Lerner had four children: three daughters, Susan (by Boyd), Liza and Jennifer (by Olson); and one son, Michael (by di Borgo).

==Songwriting==

Lerner would often struggle with writing his lyrics. He was surprisingly able to complete &quot;[[I Could Have Danced All Night]]&quot; from ''[[My Fair Lady]]'' in one 24 hour period. He usually spent months on one song and was constantly rewriting them. Lerner was said to have insecurity about his talent. He would sometimes write songs with someone in mind, for instance, &quot;[[I've Grown Accustomed To Her Face]]&quot; from ''[[My Fair Lady]]'' was written with [[Rex Harrison]] in mind to complement his very limited vocal range. He said of writing:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;You have to keep in mind that there is no such thing as realism or naturalism in the theater. That is a myth. If there was realism in the theater, there would never be a third act. Nothing ends that way. A man's life is made up of thousands and thousands of little pieces. In writing fiction, you select 20 or 30 of them. In a musical, you select even fewer than that.&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &quot;First, we decide where a song is needed in a play. Second, what is it going to be about? Third, we discuss the mood of the song. Fourth, I give (Loewe) a title. Then he writes the music to the title and the general feeling of the song is established. After he's written the melody, then I write the lyrics.&quot; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a 1979 interview on [[NPR]]'s ''[[All Things Considered]]'', Lerner went into some depth about his lyrics for ''[[My Fair Lady]]''. Professor Henry Higgins sings, &quot;Look at her, a prisoner of the gutter, condemned by every syllable she utters. By right she should be taken out and hung. But it rhymes with the tongue,&quot;. Lerner said he knew it was grammatically incorrect but were written merely for rhyme. He was later approached about it 
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;so for the cold-blooded murder of the English tongue. And I thought, oh well, maybe nobody will notice it, but not at all. Two nights after it opened, I ran into [[Noel Coward]] in a restaurant, and he walked over and he said, Dear boy, it is hanged, not hung. I said, Oh, Noel, I know it, I know it! You know, shut up! So, and there's another, then to have ever let a woman in her life. It should be as to ever let a woman in her life. but it just didn't sing well.&quot;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Alfred Gerald Caplin''' (September 28, 1909 ‚Äì November 5, 1979), better known as '''Al Capp''', was an [[United States|American]] [[cartoonist]] and [[humorist]] best known for the satirical [[comic strip]] ''[[Li'l Abner]]''. He also wrote the comic strips ''[[Abbie an' Slats]]'' and ''[[Long Sam]]''. He won the [[National Cartoonists Society]]'s [[Reuben Award]] in 1947 for Cartoonist of the Year, and their 1979 [[Elzie Segar]] Award (posthumously) for his &quot;unique and outstanding contribution to the profession of cartooning.&quot;

==Early life==
Born in [[New Haven, Connecticut]] of [[Russians|Russian]] [[Jewish]] heritage, Capp was the eldest child of Otto Philip and Matilda (Davidson) Caplin. Capp's parents were both natives of [[Latvia]] whose families had migrated to New Haven in the 1880s. &quot;My mother and father had been brought to this country from Russia when they were infants,&quot; wrote Capp in 1978. &quot;Their fathers had found that the great promise of America was true‚Äîit was no crime to be a Jew.&quot; The Caplins were dirt poor, and Capp later recalled stories of his mother going out in the night to sift through ash barrels for reusable bits of coal.

Capp lost his left leg in a [[Tram|trolley]] accident at the age of nine. This childhood tragedy likely helped shape Capp‚Äôs cynical [[worldview]], which, funny as it was, was certainly darker and more sardonic than that of the average newspaper cartoonist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,811832,00.html &quot;Inhuman Man,&quot; ''Time'', February 6, 1950]&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;I was indignant as hell about that leg,&quot; he would reveal in a November 1950 interview in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine.

&quot;The secret of how to live without resentment or embarrassment in a world in which I was different from everyone else,&quot; Capp philosophically wrote (in ''[[Life magazine]]'' on May 23, 1960&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=3k4EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA129&amp;dq=Al+Capp&amp;as_pt=MAGAZINES#v=onepage&amp;q=Al%20Capp&amp;f=false Life Magazine May 23, 1960 pp. 129‚Äì140]&lt;/ref&gt;) &quot;was to be indifferent to that difference.&quot; It was the prevailing opinion among his friends that Capp's [[Jonathan Swift|Swiftian]] satire was, to some degree, a creatively channeled, compensatory response to his disability.
[[File:Al Capp Self-portrait April 1951.JPG|right|450px|thumb|&quot;I do ''Li'l Abner''!!&quot; a self-portrait by Al Capp, excerpted from the&lt;br&gt;April 16‚Äì17, 1951, ''Li'l Abner'' strips. Note reference to [[Milton Caniff]].]]
Capp's father, a failed businessman and reportedly an amateur cartoonist, introduced him to drawing as a form of therapy. He became quite proficient, learning mostly on his own. Among his earliest influences were ''[[Punch Magazine|Punch]]'' cartoonist‚Äìillustrator [[Phil May (caricaturist)|Phil May]], and American comic strip cartoonists [[Thomas Aloysius Dorgan|Tad Dorgan]], [[Cliff Sterrett]], [[Rube Goldberg]], [[Rudolph Dirks]], [[Frederick Burr Opper|Fred Opper]], [[Billy DeBeck]], [[George McManus]] and [[Milt Gross]]. At about this same time, Capp became a voracious reader. According to Capp's brother Elliot, Alfred had finished all of [[Shakespeare]] and [[George Bernard Shaw]] by the time he turned 13. Among his childhood favorites were [[Charles Dickens|Dickens]], [[Tobias Smollett|Smollett]], [[Mark Twain]], [[Booth Tarkington]], and later, [[Robert Benchley]] and [[S. J. Perelman]].

Capp spent five years at Bridgeport High School in [[Bridgeport, Connecticut]] without receiving a diploma. The cartoonist liked to joke about how he failed geometry for nine straight terms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bridgeport.ct.schoolwebpages.com/education/components/scrapbook/default.php?sectiondetailid=5111 Web page at Bridgeport Central High School devoted to Al Capp]&lt;/ref&gt; His formal training came from a series of art schools in the [[New England]] area. Attending three of them in rapid succession, the impoverished Capp was thrown out of each for nonpayment of tuition‚Äîthe [[SMFA|Boston Museum School of Fine Arts]], the [[Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts]], and Designers Art School in Boston‚Äîthe latter before launching his amazing career. Capp had already decided to become a cartoonist. &quot;I heard that [[Bud Fisher]] (creator of ''[[Mutt and Jeff (comic strip)|Mutt and Jeff]]'') got $3,000 a week and was constantly marrying French countesses,&quot; Capp said. &quot;I decided that was for me.&quot;

In early 1932, Capp hitchhiked to [[New York City]]. He lived in &quot;airless rat holes&quot; in [[Greenwich Village]] and turned out advertising strips at $2 apiece, while scouring the city hunting for jobs. He eventually found work at the [[Associated Press]]. At 23-years old, he was reportedly the youngest [[Print syndication|syndicated]] cartoonist in America.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} By March 1932, Capp was drawing ''Colonel Gilfeather'', a single-panel, AP-owned property created in 1930 by [[Richard Dorgan|Dick Dorgan]]. Capp changed the focus and title to ''Mister Gilfeather'', but soon grew to hate the feature. He left the Associated Press in September 1932. Before leaving, he met [[Milton Caniff]], and the two became lifelong friends. Capp moved to [[Boston]] and married Catherine Wingate Cameron, whom he had met earlier in art class. She died in 2006 at the age of 96.

Leaving his new wife with her parents in [[Amesbury, Massachusetts]], he subsequently returned to New York in 1933, in the midst of the [[Great Depression]]. &quot;I was 23, I carried a mass of drawings, and I had nearly five dollars in my pocket. People were sleeping in alleys then, willing to work at anything.&quot; There he met [[Ham Fisher]], who hired him to ghost on ''[[Joe Palooka]]''. During one of Fisher's extended vacations, Capp's ''Joe Palooka'' [[story arc]] introduced a stupid, coarse, oafish mountaineer named &quot;Big Leviticus,&quot; a crude [[prototype]]. (Leviticus was actually much closer to Capp's later villains Lem and Luke Scragg, than to the much more appealing and innocent Li'l Abner.) 

Also during this period, Capp was working at night on samples for the strip that would eventually become ''[[Li'l Abner]]''. He based his cast of characters on the authentic mountain-dwellers he met while hitchhiking through rural [[West Virginia]] and the [[Cumberland Valley]] as a teenager. (This was years before the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] Act brought basic utilities like electricity and running water to the region.) Leaving ''Joe Palooka'', Capp sold ''Li'l Abner'' to United Feature Syndicate (now known as [[United Media]]). The feature was launched on Monday, August 13, 1934, in eight North American newspapers‚Äîincluding the ''[[New York Mirror]]''‚Äîand was an immediate success. Alfred G. Caplin eventually became &quot;Al Capp&quot; because the syndicate felt the original would not fit in a cartoon frame.&lt;ref&gt;A review of the 1934 strips reveals that the earliest strips were signed &quot;Al G. Cap,&quot; which became &quot;Al G. Capp&quot; and, finally, &quot;Al Capp.&quot; However, the middle initial (&quot;Al G. Capp&quot;) appeared from time to time during the first year.&lt;/ref&gt; Capp had it changed legally in 1949.

His younger brother [[Elliot Caplin]] also became a comic strip creator, best known for co-creating the [[soap opera]] strip ''[[The Heart of Juliet Jones]]'' with artist [[Stan Drake]], and conceiving the comic strip character ''[[Broom Hilda]]'' with cartoonist [[Russell Myers]]. Elliot also authored several off-Broadway plays, including ''A Nickel for Picasso'' (1981), which was based on and dedicated to his mother and his famous brother.&lt;ref&gt;[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DEFDC1F38F93BA35752C1A961948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon= ''New York Times'' theater column by Alvin Klein, November 8, 1987]&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Li'l Abner''==
{{Main|Li'l Abner}}
What began as a [[hillbilly]] [[burlesque]] soon evolved into one of the most imaginative, popular and well-drawn strips of the 20th century. Featuring vividly outlandish characters, bizarre situations, and equal parts [[suspense]], [[slapstick]], [[irony]], [[satire]], [[black humor]] and biting [[social commentary]], ''Li'l Abner'' is considered a classic of the genre. The comic strip stars Li'l Abner Yokum‚Äîthe simple-minded, loutish but good-natured and eternally innocent hayseed who lives with his parents‚Äîscrawny but superhuman Mammy Yokum, and shiftless, childlike Pappy Yokum.

&quot;Yokum&quot; was a combination of ''yokel'' and ''hokum'', although Capp established a deeper meaning for the name during a series of visits around 1965‚Äì1970 with comics historians George E. Turner and Michael H. Price. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs phonetic [[Hebrew]]‚Äîthat‚Äôs what it is, all right‚Äîand that‚Äôs what I was getting at with the name Yokum, more so than any attempt to sound ''hickish,&quot;'' said Capp. &quot;That was a fortunate coincidence, of course, that the name should pack a backwoods connotation. But it‚Äôs a godly conceit, really, playing off a godly name‚Äî''[[Joachim]]'' means 'God‚Äôs determination', something like that‚Äîthat also happens to have a rustic ring to it.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comicmix.com/news/2007/11/11/li-l-abner-lost-in-hollywood-shuffle-by-michael-h-price/ Li'l Abner Lost In Hollywood by Michael H. Price]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Yokums live in the backwater hamlet of [[Dogpatch]], [[Kentucky]]. Described by its creator as &quot;an average stone-age community&quot;, Dogpatch mostly consists of hopelessly ramshackle log cabins, pine trees, &quot;tarnip&quot; fields and &quot;hawg&quot; wallows. Whatever energy Abner had went into evading the marital goals of Daisy Mae Scragg, his sexy, well-endowed (but virtuous) girlfriend‚Äîuntil Capp finally gave in to reader pressure and allowed the couple to marry. This newsworthy event made the cover of ''Life'' on March 31, 1952.

Capp peopled his comic strip with an assortment of memorable characters, including Marryin' Sam, Hairless Joe, Lonesome Polecat, Evil-Eye Fleegle, General Bullmoose, Lena the Hyena, Senator Jack S. Phogbound (Capp's caricature of the anti-[[New Deal]] [[Dixiecrats]]), the ''(shudder!)'' Scraggs, Washable Jones, Nightmare Alice, Earthquake McGoon, and a host of others. Most notably, certainly from a [[GI (military)|G.I.]] point of view, are the beautiful, full-figured women like Daisy Mae, Wolf Gal, Stupefyin' Jones and Moonbeam McSwine (a caricature of his wife Catherine, aside from the dirt)‚Äîall of whom found their way onto the [[nose art|painted noses]] of [[bomber aircraft|bomber planes]] during [[World War II]] and the Korean War. Perhaps Capp's most popular creations were the [[Shmoo]]s, creatures whose incredible usefulness and generous nature made them a threat to civilization as we know it. Another famous character was [[Joe Btfsplk]], who wants to be a loving friend but is &quot;the world's worst [[jinx]],&quot; bringing bad luck to all those nearby. Btfsplk (his name is &quot;pronounced&quot; by simply blowing a &quot;raspberry&quot; or [[Bronx cheer (gesture)|Bronx cheer]]) always has an iconic dark cloud over his head.

Dogpatch residents regularly combat the likes of city slickers, business tycoons, government officials and intellectuals with their homespun simplicity. Situations often take the characters to other destinations, including New York City, [[Washington, D.C.]], [[Hollywood]], tropical islands, the Moon, Mars, and some purely fanciful worlds of Capp's invention. The latter includes El Passionato, Kigmyland, The Republic of Crumbumbo, Skunk Hollow, The Valley of the Shmoon, Planets Pincus Number 2 and 7, and a miserable frozen wasteland known as [[Lower Slobbovia]], a pointedly political satire of backward nations and foreign [[diplomacy]] that remains a contemporary reference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Baker |first=Russell |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/13/opinion/observer-hillary-in-lower-slobbovia.html |title=Hillary in Lower Slobbovia - '&amp;#39;NY Times'&amp;#39; Jan. 13, 1996 |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=1996-01-13 |accessdate=2009-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Indeed, ''Li'l Abner'' incorporates such a panoply of characters and ideas that it defies summary,&quot; according to cultural historian Anthony Harkins. &quot;Yet though Capp's storylines often wandered far afield, his hillbilly setting remained a central touchstone, serving both as a [[macrocosm and microcosm|microcosm]] and a distorting carnival mirror of broader American society.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;''Hillbilly: A Cultural History of an American Icon'' by Anthony Harkins (2004, Oxford Univ. Press) pp. 124‚Äì136&lt;/ref&gt;

The strip's popularity grew from an original eight papers, to ultimately more than 900. At its peak, ''Li'l Abner'' was read daily by 70 million Americans (the [[U.S. population]] at the time was only 180 million), with adult readers far outnumbering children. Many communities, high schools and colleges staged [[Sadie Hawkins Dance|Sadie Hawkins dances]], patterned after the similar annual event in the strip.

Li'l Abner has one odd design quirk that has puzzled readers for decades: the part in his hair always faces the viewer, no matter which direction Abner is facing. In response to the question ‚ÄúWhich side does Abner part his hair on?&quot;, Capp would answer, ‚ÄúBoth.‚Äù Capp said he finally found the right &quot;look&quot; for Li'l Abner with [[Henry Fonda]]'s character Dave Tolliver, in ''[[The Trail of the Lonesome Pine (1936 film)|The Trail of the Lonesome Pine]]'' (1936).&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=U99JAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=fonda+%22li%27l+abner%22&amp;dq=fonda+%22li%27l+abner%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=0 Steen, Mike ''Hollywood Speaks: An Oral History'' Putnam, 1974]&lt;/ref&gt; In later years, Capp always claimed to have effectively created the [[miniskirt]], when he first put one on Daisy Mae in 1934.

Caniff, in 1985, said Capp &quot;was far more an intellectual than he allowed the public to see. ''Li'l Abner'' was his joke on the dismal world around him. His humor welled-up from the melancholy pits of a strapping kid made an amputee at age nine&quot;.

==Parodies, toppers and alternate strips==
''Li'l Abner'' also features a comic strip-within-the-strip: ''[[Fearless Fosdick]]'' is a [[parody]] of [[Chester Gould]]'s ''[[Dick Tracy]]''. It first appeared in 1942, and proved so popular that it ran intermittently over the next 35 years. Gould was personally parodied in the series as cartoonist &quot;Lester Gooch&quot;‚Äîthe diminutive, much-harassed and occasionally deranged &quot;creator&quot; of Fosdick. The style of the ''Fosdick'' sequences closely mimicks ''Tracy'', including the urban setting, the outrageous villains, the galloping [[mortality rate]], the crosshatched shadows, and even the lettering style. In 1952, Fosdick was the star of his own short-lived [[puppet show]] on [[NBC]], featuring the Mary Chase [[marionette]]s.

Besides ''Dick Tracy'', Capp parodied many other comic strips in ''Li'l Abner''‚Äîincluding ''[[Steve Canyon]]'', ''[[Superman (comic strip)|Superman]]'', (at least twice; first as &quot;Jack Jawbreaker&quot;, 1947, and again in 1966 as &quot;Chickensouperman&quot;) ''[[Mary Worth]]'', ''[[Peanuts]]'', ''[[Little Annie Rooney]]'' and ''[[Little Orphan Annie]]'' (in which Punjab became &quot;Punjbag&quot;, an oleaginous slob). ''Fearless Fosdick''‚Äîand Capp's other spoofs like &quot;Little Fanny Gooney&quot; (1952) and &quot;Jack Jawbreaker&quot;‚Äîwere almost certainly an early inspiration for [[Harvey Kurtzman]]'s ''[[Mad Magazine]]'', which began in 1952 as a [[comic book]] that specifically parodied other comics in the same distinctive style and subversive manner.

Capp also lampooned popular recording idols of the day, such as [[Elvis Presley]] (&quot;Hawg McCall&quot;, 1957), [[Liberace]] (&quot;Loverboynik&quot;, 1956), [[the Beatles]] (&quot;the Beasties&quot;, 1964)‚Äîand in 1944, [[Frank Sinatra]]. &quot;Sinatra was the first great public figure I ever wrote about,&quot; Capp once said. &quot;I called him 'Hal Fascinatra'. I remember my news syndicate was so worried about what his reaction might be, and we were all surprised when he telephoned and told me how thrilled he was with it. He always made it a point to send me champagne whenever he happened to see me in a restaurant...&quot; (from ''Frank Sinatra, My Father'' by [[Nancy Sinatra]], 1985). On the other hand Liberace was &quot;cut to the quick&quot; over Loverboynik, according to Capp, and even threatened legal action‚Äîas would [[Joan Baez]] later, over &quot;Joanie Phoanie&quot; in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.upi.com/topic/Al_Capp/ UPI Photo/Files Al Capp Jan. 11, 1967]&lt;/ref&gt;

Capp was just as likely to parody himself; his self-caricature made frequent, tongue-in-cheek appearances in ''Li'l Abner''. The gag was often at his own expense, as in the above 1951 sequence showing Capp's interaction with &quot;fans&quot; (see excerpt), or in his 1955 [[Disneyland Park (Anaheim)|Disneyland]] parody, &quot;Hal Yappland&quot;. Just about anything could be a target for Capp's satire‚Äîin one storyline Li'l Abner is revealed to be the [[missing link]] between ape and man. In another, the search is on in Dogpatch for a pair of missing socks knitted by the first President of the United States.
 
In addition to creating ''Li'l Abner'', Capp also co-created two other newspaper strips: ''[[Abbie an' Slats]]'' with magazine illustrator [[Raeburn van Buren]] in 1937, and ''[[Long Sam]]'' with cartoonist [[Bob Lubbers]] in 1954, as well as the Sunday &quot;[[topper (comic strip)|topper]]&quot; strips ''Washable Jones'', ''Small Fry'' (aka ''Small Change'') and ''Advice fo' Chillun''.

==Critical recognition==
According to comics historian [[Coulton Waugh]], a 1947 poll of newspaper readers who claimed they ignored the comics page altogether revealed that many confessed to making a single exception: ''Li'l Abner''. &quot;When ''Li'l Abner'' made its debut in 1934, the vast majority of comic strips were designed chiefly to amuse or thrill their readers. Capp turned that world upside-down by routinely injecting politics and social commentary into ''Li'l Abner''. The strip was the first to regularly introduce characters and story lines having nothing to do with the nominal stars of the strip. The technique‚Äîas invigorating as it was unorthodox‚Äîwas later adopted by cartoonists like [[Walt Kelly]] [''[[Pogo (comics)|Pogo]]''] and [[Garry Trudeau]] [''[[Doonesbury]]''],&quot; wrote comic strip historian [[Rick Marschall]].

According to Marschall, ''Li'l Abner'' gradually evolved into a broad satire of [[human nature]]. In his book ''America's Great Comic Strip Artists'' (1989), Marschall's analysis revealed a decidedly [[misanthropic]] [[subtext]]: &quot;Capp was calling [[society]] absurd, not just silly; human nature not simply misguided, but irredeemably and irreducibly corrupt. Unlike any other strip, and indeed unlike many other pieces of literature, ''Li'l Abner'' was more than a satire of the [[human condition]]. It was a commentary on human nature itself.&quot;

Over the years, ''Li'l Abner'' has been adapted to radio, [[Character animation|animated cartoons]], stage production, [[motion pictures]] and television. Capp has been compared, at various times, to [[Mark Twain]], [[Dostoevski]], [[Jonathan Swift]], [[Lawrence Sterne]] and [[Rabelais]].&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Rodger, &quot;Dogpatch USA: The Road to Hokum&quot; article, ''Southern Changes: The Journal of the Southern Regional Council'', Vol. 15, No. 3, 1993, pp. 18-26&lt;/ref&gt; Fans of the strip ranged from novelist [[John Steinbeck]], who called Capp &quot;possibly the best writer in the world today&quot; in 1953, and even earnestly recommended him for the [[Nobel Prize]] in literature‚Äîto media critic and theorist [[Marshall McLuhan]], who considered Capp &quot;the only robust satirical force in American life.&quot; [[John Updike]], comparing Abner to a ‚Äúhillbilly [[Candide]]‚Äù, added that the strip‚Äôs ‚Äúrichness of social and philosophical commentary approached the [[Voltairean]].‚Äù &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.city-journal.org/2010/20_2_urb-al-capp.html Exile in Dogpatch: The Curious Neglect of Cartoonist Al Capp, ''City Journal,'' Spring 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charlie Chaplin]], [[William F. Buckley]], [[Al Hirschfeld]], [[Harpo Marx]], [[Russ Meyer]], [[John Kenneth Galbraith]], [[Ralph Bakshi]], [[Shel Silverstein]], [[Hugh Downs]], [[Gene Shalit]], [[Frank Cho]], [[Daniel Clowes]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=28945 Spotlight on Daniel Clowes, ''CBR'' 18 October 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; and (reportedly) even [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth]] have confessed to being fans of ''Li'l Abner''.

''Li'l Abner'' was also the subject of the first book-length, scholarly assessment of an American comic strip ever published. ''Li'l Abner: A Study in American Satire'' by Arthur Asa Berger (Twayne, 1969) contained serious analyses of Capp's narrative technique, his use of dialogue, self-caricature and grotesquerie, the place of ''Li'l Abner'' in American satire, and the significance of social criticism and the graphic image. &quot;One of the few strips ever taken seriously by students of American culture&quot;, wrote Professor Berger, &quot;''Li'l Abner'' is worth studying... because of Capp's imagination and artistry, and because of the strip's very obvious social relevance.&quot; It was reprinted by the [[University Press of Mississippi]] in 1994.

[[John Updike]] called ''Li'l Abner'' &quot;a comic strip with fire in its belly and a brain in its head&quot;. [[Salon.com]], calling the strip &quot;one of the 20th century's three greatest comic strips&quot;, said Capp &quot;mixed comedy and suspense in a daily cocktail that no one else has come close to duplicating&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;salon&quot; /&gt; In ''The Road to Hokum'' (1994), Rodger Brown said 
{{quote|Capp was master of every technique [[postmodernists]] celebrate: juxtaposition, parody, satire, irony, intertextual referencing, [[bricolage]], [[chaos]], [[surrealism|the surreal]], the carnivalesque, the [[tragicomic]] [[slapstick]] of differences. In ''Li'l Abner,'' systems of logic and morality clashed... and from the resulting dreamscape of discourses came satirical comedy. Like all satire, the real and the fictive combined to produce grotesque offspring.}}

==The 1940s and 1950s==
[[File:Cappbio46.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Al Capp drew his own autobiography, the 34-page ''Al Capp by Li'l Abner'' (1946), distributed to returning WWII amputee veterans.]]
During World War II and for many years afterward, Capp worked tirelessly going to [[hospital]]s to entertain patients, especially to cheer recent [[amputee]]s and explain to them that the loss of a limb did not mean an end to a happy and productive life. Making no secret of his own disability, Capp openly joked about his [[prosthetic]] leg his whole life. In 1946 Capp created a special full-color comic book, ''Al Capp by Li'l Abner'', to be distributed by the [[Red Cross]] to encourage the thousands of amputee veterans returning from the war. Capp was also involved with the [[Elizabeth Kenny|Sister Kenny Foundation]], which pioneered new treatments for [[polio]] in the 1940s. Serving in his capacity as honorary chairman, Capp made public appearances on its behalf for years, contributed free artwork for its annual fund-raising appeals, and entertained crippled and [[paraplegic]] children in children's hospitals with inspirational pep talks, humorous stories and sketches.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lettersofnote.com/2010/05/dont-keep-remembering-what-youve-lost.html Letters of Note: Dear Chip... (Columbus Hospital, 28 May 1964)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1940, an [[RKO Pictures|RKO]] movie adaptation starred Granville Owen (later known as [[Jeff York]]) as Li'l Abner, with [[Buster Keaton]] taking the role of Lonesome Polecat, and featuring a title song with lyrics by [[Milton Berle]]. A successful [[musical film|musical comedy]] adaptation of the strip opened on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] at the St. James Theater on November 15, 1956 and had a long run of 693 performances, followed by a nationwide tour. The [[Li'l Abner (musical)|stage musical]], with music and lyrics by [[Gene de Paul]] and [[Johnny Mercer]], was adapted into a [[Technicolor]] [[Li'l Abner (1959 film)|motion picture]] at [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] in 1959 by producer [[Norman Panama]] and director [[Melvin Frank]], with a score by [[Nelson Riddle]]. Several performers repeated their Broadway roles in the film, most memorably [[Julie Newmar]] as Stupefyin' Jones and [[Stubby Kaye]] as Marryin' Sam.&lt;ref&gt;[http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9F04E3D9103CE63BBC4A52DFB4678382649EDE The Screen 'Li'l Abner' - New York Times Review]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other highlights of that decade included the 1942 debut of Fearless Fosdick as Abner's &quot;ideel&quot; (hero); the 1946 Lena the Hyena Contest in which a hideous Lower Slobbovian gal was ultimately revealed in the harrowing winning entry (as judged by Frank Sinatra, [[Boris Karloff]] and [[Salvador Dal√≠]]) drawn by noted cartoonist [[Basil Wolverton]]; and an ill-fated Sunday parody of ''[[Gone With the Wind]]'' that aroused anger and legal threats from author [[Margaret Mitchell]] and led to a printed apology within the strip. In October 1947, Li'l Abner met Rockwell P. Squeezeblood, head of the abusive and corrupt Squeezeblood Comic Strip Syndicate. The resulting sequence, ''&quot;Jack Jawbreaker Fights Crime!&quot;'', was a devastating satire of [[Jerry Siegel]] and [[Joe Shuster]]'s notorious exploitation by [[DC Comics]] over ''[[Superman]]''. It was later reprinted in ''The World of Li'l Abner'' (1953). (Siegel and Shuster had earlier poked fun at Capp in a ''Superman'' story in ''[[Action Comics]]'' #55 (December 1942), in which a cartoonist named &quot;Al Hatt&quot; invents a comic strip featuring the hillbilly &quot;Tiny Rufe&quot;.)

In 1947, Capp earned a ''[[Newsweek]]'' cover story. That same year the ''[[New Yorker magazine|New Yorker's]]'' profile on him was so long that it ran in consecutive issues. In 1948, Capp reached a creative peak with the introduction of the Shmoos, lovable and innocent fantasy creatures who reproduced at amazing speed and brought so many benefits that, ironically, the world economy was endangered. The much-copied storyline was a [[parable]] that was [[metaphor]]ically interpreted in many different ways at the outset of the [[Cold War]].

Following his close friend Milton Caniff's lead (with ''[[Steve Canyon]]''), Capp had recently fought a successful battle with the syndicate to gain complete ownership of his feature when the Shmoos debuted. As a result, he reaped enormous financial rewards from the unexpected (and almost unprecedented) merchandising phenomenon that followed. As in the strip, Shmoos suddenly appeared to be everywhere in 1949 and 1950‚Äîincluding a ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' cover story, and a paperback collection of the original sequence, ''The Life and Times of the Shmoo'', became a bestseller for [[Simon &amp; Schuster]]. Shmoo dolls, clocks, watches, jewelry, earmuffs, wallpaper, fishing lures, air fresheners, soap, ice cream, balloons, ashtrays, comic books, records, sheet music, toys, games, [[Halloween]] masks, salt and pepper shakers, decals, pinbacks, tumblers, coin banks, greeting cards, planters, neckties, suspenders, belts, curtains, fountain pens, and other shmoo paraphernalia were produced. A garment factory in [[Baltimore]] turned out a whole line of shmoo apparel, including &quot;Shmooveralls.&quot; The original sequence and its 1959 sequel, ''The Return of the Shmoo'', have been collected in print many times since, most recently in 2002, always to high sales figures. The Shmoos would later have their own animated TV series.

Capp followed this success with other [[allegory|allegorical]] fantasy critters, including the aboriginal and [[masochistic]] &quot;Kigmies&quot;, who craved abuse (a story that began as a veiled comment on racial and religious oppression), the dreaded &quot;Nogoodniks&quot; (or ''bad'' shmoos), and the irresistible &quot;Bald Iggle&quot;, a guileless creature whose sad-eyed countenance compelled involuntary truthfulness‚Äîwith predictably disastrous results.

''Li'l Abner'' was [[censorship|censored]] for the first, but not the last time in September 1947, and was pulled from papers by [[Scripps-Howard]]. The controversy, as reported in ''Time'', centered on Capp's portrayal of the [[United States Senate]]. Said Edward Leech of Scripps, &quot;We don't think it is good editing or sound citizenship to picture the Senate as an assemblage of freaks and crooks... boobs and undesirables.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,804275,00.html Tain't Funny - TIME]&lt;/ref&gt; He criticized [[Senator Joseph McCarthy]] in 1954, calling him a 'poet': &quot;He uses [[poetic license]] to try to create the beautifully ordered world of good guys and bad guys that he wants. He seems at his best when terrifying the helpless and na√Øve.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;&quot;Poet: Cartoonist Al Capp said in New York...&quot; quoted in ''The Argus'', 10 May 1954&lt;/ref&gt;

Capp was also an outspoken pioneer in favor of diversifying the [[National Cartoonists Society]] by admitting women cartoonists. Originally, the NCS disallowed female members. Capp briefly resigned his membership in 1949, to protest their refusal of admission to [[Hilda Terry]], creator of the comic strip ''[[Teena]]''. According to Tom Roberts, author of ''[[Alex Raymond]]: His Life and Art'' (2007), Capp delivered a stirring speech that was instrumental in changing those rules. The Society finally accepted female members the following year. In December 1952, Capp published an article in ''Real'' magazine titled ‚ÄúThe REAL Powers in America‚Äù that further challenged the conventional attitudes of the day: &quot;The real powers in America are ''women''‚Äîthe wives and sweethearts behind the masculine dummies...&quot;

Highlights of the 1950s included the much-heralded marriage of Abner and Daisy Mae in 1952, the birth of their son &quot;Honest Abe&quot; Yokum in 1953, and in 1954, the introduction of Abner's enormous, long lost kid brother Tiny Yokum, who filled Abner's place as a bachelor in the annual Sadie Hawkins Day race. In 1952, Capp and his characters graced the covers of both ''Life'' and ''[[TV Guide]]''. 1956 saw the debut of the Bald Iggle, considered by some ''Abner'' enthusiasts to be the creative high point of the strip, as well as Mammy's revelatory encounter with the &quot;Square Eyes&quot; Family‚ÄîCapp‚Äôs thinly veiled appeal for racial tolerance. (This [[fable]]-like story was collected into an educational comic book called ''Mammy Yokum and the Great Dogpatch Mystery!'', and distributed by the [[Anti-Defamation League]] of [[B'nai B'rith]] later that year.)

Capp had often parodied corporate greed‚Äîpork tycoon J. Roaringham Fatback had figured prominently in wiping out the Shmoos. But in 1952, when [[General Motors]] president [[Charles Erwin Wilson|Charles E. Wilson]], nominated for a cabinet post, told [[United States Congress|Congress]] &quot;...what was good for the country was good for General Motors and vice versa&quot;, he inspired one of Capp's greatest satires‚Äîthe introduction of General Bullmoose, the robust, ruthless, and ageless business tycoon. The blustering Bullmoose, who seemed to own and control nearly everything, justified his far-reaching and mercenary excesses by saying &quot;What's good for General Bullmoose is good for ''everybody!&quot;'' Bullmoose's corrupt interests were often pitted against those of the pathetic Lower Slobbovians in a classic mismatch of &quot;haves&quot; versus &quot;have-nots&quot;. This character, along with the Shmoos, helped cement Capp's favor with the [[Left-wing politics|Left]], and would increase their outrage a decade later when Capp, a former [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] liberal, switched targets. Nonetheless, General Bullmoose continued to appear, undaunted and unredeemed, during the strip's final right-wing phase and into the 1970s.

==Feud with Ham Fisher==
After Capp quit his ghosting job on [[Ham Fisher]]'s ''Joe Palooka'' in 1934 to launch his own strip, Fisher badmouthed him to colleagues and editors, claiming that Capp had &quot;stolen&quot; his idea. For years, Fisher would bring the characters back to his strip, billing them as &quot;The ORIGINAL Hillbilly Characters&quot; and advising readers not to be &quot;fooled by imitations.&quot; (In fact, Fisher's brutish hillbilly character‚ÄîBig Leviticus, created by Capp in Fisher's absence‚Äîbore little resemblance to Li'l Abner.) According to a November 1950 ''Time'' article, &quot;Capp parted from Fisher with a definite impression, (to put it mildly) that he had been underpaid and unappreciated. Fisher, a man of Roman self esteem, considered Capp an ingrate and a whippersnapper, and watched his rise to fame with unfeigned horror.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,813720-7,00.html Die Monstersinger - TIME]&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;Fisher repeatedly brought Leviticus and his clan back, claiming their primacy as comics' first hillbilly family‚Äîbut he was missing the point. It wasn't the setting that made Capp's strip such a huge success. It was Capp's finely tuned sense of the absurd, his ability to milk an outrageous situation for every laugh in it and then, impossibly, to squeeze even more laughs from it, that found such favor with the public,&quot; (from [[Don Markstein]]'s ''[[Toonopedia]]''.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toonopedia.com/abner.htm Don Markstein's Toonopedia / Li'l Abner]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Capp-Fisher feud was well-known in cartooning circles, and it grew more personal as Capp's strip eclipsed ''Joe Palooka'' in popularity. Fisher hired away Capp's top assistant, [[Moe Leff]]. After Fisher underwent [[plastic surgery]], Capp included a racehorse in ''Li'l Abner'' named &quot;Ham's Nose-Bob&quot;. In 1950, Capp introduced a cartoonist character named &quot;Happy Vermin&quot;‚Äîa caricature of Fisher‚Äîwho hired Abner to draw his comic strip in a dimly lit closet, (after sacking his previous &quot;temporary&quot; assistant of 20 years, who had been cut off from all his friends in the process.) Instead of using Vermin's tired characters, Abner inventively peopled the strip with hillbillies. A bighearted Vermin told his slaving assistant: &quot;I'm proud of having created these characters!! They'll make millions for me!! And if they do‚ÄîI'll get ''you'' a new light bulb!!&quot;

Traveling in the same social circles, the two men engaged in a 20-year mutual vendetta, as described by the ''[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]'' in 1998: &quot;They crossed paths often, in the midtown watering holes and at National Cartoonists Society banquets, and the city's gossip columns were full of their snarling public donnybrooks.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/1998/09/18/1998-09-18_spitting_on_pictures_funny_p.html SPITTING ON PICTURES FUNNY PAPERS, 1955]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1950, Capp wrote a nasty article for ''[[The Atlantic]]'' entitled &quot;I Remember Monster&quot;. The article recounted Capp's days working for an unnamed &quot;benefactor&quot; with a miserly, swinish personality, whom Capp claimed was a never-ending source of inspiration when it came time to create a new unregenerate villain for his comic strip. The thinly veiled boss was understood to be Ham Fisher.

Fisher retaliated clumsily, doctoring photostats of ''Li'l Abner'' and falsely accusing Capp of sneaking obscenities into his comic strip. Fisher submitted examples of ''Li'l Abner'' to Capp's syndicate and to the New York courts, in which Fisher had identified pornographic images that were hidden in the background art. However, the X-rated material had actually been drawn there by Fisher himself. Capp was able to refute the accusation by simply showing the original artwork.

In 1954, when Capp was applying for a Boston television license, the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) received an anonymous packet of pornographic ''Li'l Abner'' drawings. The National Cartoonists Society (NCS) convened an ethics hearing, and Fisher was expelled for the forgery from the same organization that he had helped found; Fisher's scheme had backfired in spectacular fashion. Around the same time, his mansion in Wisconsin was destroyed by a [[nor'easter]]. On December 27, 1955, Fisher committed suicide in his studio.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/1998/09/18/1998-09-18_spitting_on_pictures_funny_p.html Maeder, Jay. ‚ÄúSpitting on Pictures Funny Papers, 1955‚Äù, ''Daily News'', September 18, 1998.]&lt;/ref&gt; The feud and Fisher's suicide were used as the basis for a lurid, highly fictional murder mystery, ''Strip for Murder'' by [[Max Allan Collins]].

Another &quot;feud&quot; seemed to be looming when, in one run of Sunday strips in 1957, Capp lampooned the comic strip ''[[Mary Worth]]'' as &quot;Mary Worm.&quot; The title character was depicted as a nosy, interfering busybody. [[Allen Saunders]], the creator of the ''Mary Worth'' strip, returned Capp's fire with the introduction of the character &quot;Hal Rapp,&quot; a foul-tempered, ill-mannered, and (ironically) inebriated cartoonist (Capp was a [[teetotaler]]). Later, it was revealed to be a collaborative hoax that Capp and his longtime pal Saunders had cooked up together. The Capp-Saunders &quot;feud&quot; fooled both editors and readers, generated plenty of free publicity for both strips‚Äîand Capp and Saunders had a good laugh when all was revealed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,893653,00.html Rap for Capp - TIME]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personality==
Volatile, contentious, cynical, sarcastic, contradictory, iconoclastic, misanthropic, curmudgeonly, controversial, and sardonically funny. According to Capp‚Äôs longtime friend Milton Caniff, Capp was ‚Äúcharming‚Äù when he chose to be, but added that ‚Äúhe could be ''very'' difficult if he didn‚Äôt like you.‚Äù [[Frank Frazetta]] described Capp as &quot;exasperating, infuriating, domineering, obnoxious, loud, lots of fun, acidic and lovable.&quot; Frazetta's freewheeling description typifies the many conflicting firsthand accounts of Capp's complex personality. &quot;He could be a real s.o.b. sometimes. Other times he was a lot of fun to be around. He was a brilliant guy‚Äîbut a little screwed up,&quot; Frazetta has said (from ''The Comic Art of Frank Frazetta'', 2008). In 1971, Walt Kelly said Capp &quot;doesn't put his best foot forward always, but what foot he does put forward is one of his own&quot;. Capp's persona has long since eclipsed his work, complicating critical analysis and objective assessment of ''Li'l Abner'' to this day.

Capp is often associated with two other giants of the medium: Milton Caniff (''[[Terry and the Pirates (comic strip)|Terry and the Pirates]]'', ''Steve Canyon'') and Walt Kelly (''[[Pogo (comics)|Pogo]]''). The three cartoonists were close personal friends and professional associates throughout their adult lives, and occasionally referenced each other in their strips. According to one [[anecdote]], (from ''Al Capp Remembered'', 1994) Capp and his brother Elliot ducked out of a dull party at Capp's home‚Äîleaving Walt Kelly alone to fend for himself entertaining a group of Argentine envoys who didn't speak English. Kelly retaliated by giving away Capp's [[baby grand piano]]. According to Capp, who loved to relate the story, Kelly's two perfectly logical reasons for doing so were: a. to cement diplomatic relations between [[Argentina]] and the United States, and b. &quot;Because you can't play the piano, anyway!&quot; (''[[Beetle Bailey]]'' creator [[Mort Walker]] confirmed the story, relating a slightly expanded version in his autobiography, ''Mort Walker's Private Scrapbook'', 2001.)

Milton Caniff offered another anecdote (from ''Phi Beta Pogo'', 1989) involving Capp and Walt Kelly, &quot;two boys from [[Bridgeport, Connecticut]], nose to nose,&quot; onstage at a meeting of the Newspaper Comics Council in the sixties. &quot;Walt would say to Al, 'Of course, Al, this is really how you should draw Daisy Mae, I'm only showing you this for your own good.' Then Walt would do a sketch. Capp, of course, got ticked off by this, as you can imagine! So he retaliated by doing ''his'' version of Pogo. Unfortunately, the drawings are long gone; no recording was made. What a shame! Nobody anticipated there'd be this dueling back and forth between the two of them....&quot;

==Production methods==
Like many cartoonists, Capp made extensive use of assistants (notably Andy Amato, Harvey Curtis, Walter Johnson and Frank Frazetta). During the extended peak of the strip, the workload grew to include advertising, merchandising, promotional work, public service comics and other specialty work‚Äîin addition to the regular six dailies and one [[Sunday strip]] per week. From the early 1940s to the late 1950s, there were scores of Sunday strip-style magazine ads for [[Cream of Wheat]] using the ''Abner'' characters, and in the 1950s, Fearless Fosdick became a spokesman for Wildroot Cream-Oil hair tonic in a series of daily strip-style print ads. The characters also sold chainsaws, underwear, ties, detergent, candy, soft drinks‚Äîincluding a licensed version of Capp's moonshine creation, [[Kickapoo Joy Juice]]‚Äîand [[General Electric]] and [[Procter &amp; Gamble]] products, all requiring special artwork.

No matter how much help he had, Capp insisted on drawing and inking the characters' faces and hands‚Äîespecially of Abner and Daisy Mae‚Äîhimself, and his distinctive touch is often discernible. &quot;He had ''the touch,''&quot; Frazetta said of Capp in 2008. &quot;He knew how to take an otherwise ordinary drawing and really make it ''pop''. I'll never knock his talent.&quot;

As is usual with collaborative efforts in comic strips, his name was the only one credited‚Äî although, sensitive to his own experience working on ''Joe Palooka'', Capp frequently drew attention to his assistants in interviews and publicity pieces. A 1950 cover story in [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] even included photos of two of his employees, whose roles in the production were detailed by Capp. Ironically, this highly irregular policy (along with the subsequent fame of Frank Frazetta) has led to the misconception that his strip was &quot;ghosted&quot; by other hands. The production of ''Li'l Abner'' has been well documented, however. In point of fact, Capp maintained creative control over every stage of production for virtually the entire run of the strip. Capp himself originated the stories, wrote the dialogue, designed the major characters, rough penciled the preliminary staging and action of each panel, oversaw the finished pencils, and drew and inked the hands and faces of the characters. Frazetta authority David Winiewicz described the everyday working mode of operation in ''Li'l Abner Dailies: 1954 Volume 20'' (Kitchen Sink, 1994):

{{bquote|By the time Frazetta began working on the strip, the work of producing ''Li'l Abner'' was too much for one person. Capp had a group of assistants who he taught to reproduce his distinctive individual style, working under his direct supervision. Actual production of the strip began with a rough layout in pencil done by Al Capp, from Capp's script or a co-authored script, and the page would pass to Andy Amato and Walter Johnson. Amato would ink the figures, then Johnson added backgrounds and any mechanical objects. Harvey Curtis was responsible for the lettering and also shared inking duties with Amato... In order to make sure that the work stayed true to his style, the final touches would be added by Capp himself. He enjoyed adding a distinctive glint to an eye or an idiosyncratic contortion to a character's face. The finished strip was truly an ensemble effort, a skillful blending of talents.|30|30|}}

There was also a separate line of comic book titles published by the Caplin family-owned Toby Press, including ''Shmoo Comics'' featuring Washable Jones. Cartoonist [[Mell Lazarus]], creator of ''[[Miss Peach]]'' and ''[[Momma]]'', wrote a comic novel in 1963 titled ''The Boss Is Crazy, Too'' which was partly inspired by his apprenticeship days working with Capp and his brother Elliot at Toby. In a seminar at the [[Charles Schulz Museum]] on November 8, 2008, Lazarus called his experience at Toby &quot;the five funniest years of my life&quot;. Lazarus went on to cite Capp as one of the &quot;four essentials&quot; in the field of newspaper cartoonists, along with Walt Kelly, [[Charles Schulz]] and [[Milton Caniff]].

Capp detailed his approach to writing and drawing the stories in an instructional course book for the [[Famous Artists School]], beginning in 1956. In 1959, Capp recorded and released an album for [[Folkways Records]] (now owned by the [[Smithsonian]]) on which he identified and described &quot;The Mechanics of the Comic Strip&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.folkways.si.edu/albumdetails.aspx?itemid=1284 An Interview with Al Capp - Smithsonian Folkways]&lt;/ref&gt;

Frazetta, later famous as a [[fantasy art]]ist, assisted on the strip from 1954 to December, 1961. Fascinated by Frazetta's abilities, Capp initially gave him a free hand in an extended daily sequence (about a biker named &quot;Frankie&quot;, a caricature of Frazetta) to experiment with the basic look of the strip by adding a bit more realism and detail (particularly to the inking). After editors complained about the stylistic changes, the strip's previous look was restored. During most of his tenure with Capp, Frazetta's primary responsibility‚Äîalong with various specialty art, such as a series of ''Li'l Abner'' greeting cards‚Äîwas tight-penciling the Sunday pages from studio roughs. This work was collected by [[Dark Horse Comics]] in a four-volume hardcover series entitled ''Al Capp's Li'l Abner: The Frazetta Years''. In 1961, Capp, complaining of declining revenue, wanted to have Frazetta continue with a 50% pay cut. &quot;[Capp] said he would cut the salary in half. Goodbye. That was that. ''I'' said goodbye.&quot; (''Frazetta: Painting with Fire''). However, Frazetta returned briefly a few years later to draw a public service comic book called ''Li'l Abner and the Creatures from Drop-Outer Space'', distributed by the [[Job Corps]] in 1965.

==Public figure==
In the golden age of the American comic strip, successful cartoonists received a great deal of attention; their professional and private lives were reported in the press, and their celebrity was often nearly sufficient to rival their creations. As ''Li'l Abner'' reached its peak years, and following the success of the Shmoos and other high moments in his work, Al Capp achieved a public profile that is still unparalleled in his profession, and arguably exceeded the fame of his strip. &quot;Capp was the best known, most influential and most controversial cartoonist of his era,&quot; writes publisher (and leading Shmoo collector) [[Denis Kitchen]]. &quot;His personal celebrity transcended comics, reaching the public and influencing the culture in a variety of media. For many years he simultaneously produced the daily strip, a weekly syndicated [[newspaper column]], and a 500-station [[radio program]]....&quot; He ran the Boston Summer Theatre with ''[[The Phantom (comics)|Phantom]]'' cartoonist, [[Lee Falk]], bringing in Hollywood actors such as [[Mae West]], [[Melvyn Douglas]] and [[Claude Rains]] to star in their live productions. He even briefly considered running for a Massachusetts Senate seat. [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Spiro Agnew]] urged Capp to run in the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] [[Massachusetts]] primary in 1970 against [[Ted Kennedy]], but Capp ultimately declined. (He did, however, donate his services as a speaker at a $100-a-plate fundraiser for Republican Congressman [[Jack Kemp]].)

Besides his use of the comic strip to voice his opinions and display his humor, Capp was a popular speaker at universities and on [[television]]. He remains the only cartoonist to be embraced by TV; no other comic artist to date has come close to Capp's televised exposure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nieman.harvard.edu/reportsitem.aspx?id=102060 Al Capp Views the Networks (April 1952) ''Nieman Reports'']&lt;/ref&gt; Capp appeared as a regular on ''[[The Author Meets the Critics]]'' (1948‚Äì'54) and made regular, weekly appearances on ''[[The Today Show]]'' in 1953. He was also a periodic panelist on ABC and NBC's ''Who Said That?'' (1948‚Äì'55) and co-hosted DuMont's ''What's The Story?'' (1953). Between 1952 and 1972, he hosted at least ''five'' television shows&amp;ndash;three different [[talk show]]s called ''The Al Capp Show'' (1952 and 1968) and ''Al Capp'' (1971‚Äì'72), ''Al Capp's America'' (a live &quot;chalk talk&quot;, with Capp providing a barbed commentary while sketching cartoons, 1954), and a CBS game show called ''Anyone Can Win'' (1953). He also hosted similar vehicles on the radio‚Äîand was a familiar celebrity guest on various other broadcast programs, including the long-running NBC radio series, ''[[Monitor (NBC radio)|Monitor]]''.

His frequent appearances on NBC's ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' spanned three emcees ([[Steve Allen]], [[Jack Paar]] and [[Johnny Carson]]) from the 1950s to the 1970s. One memorable story, as recounted to Johnny Carson, was about his meeting with then-President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]. As he was ushered into the [[Oval Office]], his [[Prosthesis|prosthetic leg]] suddenly collapsed into a pile of disengaged parts and hinges on the floor. The President immediately turned to an aide and said, &quot;Call [[Walter Reed Army Medical Center|Walter Reed]] (Hospital), or maybe [[National Naval Medical Center|Bethesda]],&quot; to which Capp replied, &quot;Hell no, just call a good local mechanic!&quot; (Capp also spoofed Carson in his strip, in a 1970 episode called &quot;The Tommy Wholesome Show&quot;.)

Capp portrayed himself in a cameo role in the [[Bob Hope]] film ''That Certain Feeling'' (for which he also provided promotional art). He was interviewed live on ''[[Person to Person]]'' on 27 November 1959, by host [[Charles Collingwood]]. He also appeared as himself on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'', [[Sid Caesar]]'s ''[[Your Show of Shows]]'', ''[[The Red Skelton Show]]'', ''[[The Merv Griffin Show]]'', ''[[The Mike Douglas Show]]'', and guested on [[Ralph Edwards]]' ''[[This Is Your Life]]'' on February 12, 1961 with honoree Peter Palmer. Capp also freelanced very successfully as a magazine writer and newspaper columnist, in a wide variety of publications including ''[[Life magazine|Life]]'', ''Show'', ''Pageant'', ''[[The Atlantic]]'', ''[[Esquire magazine|Esquire]]'', ''Coronet'', and ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]''. Capp was impersonated by comedians [[Rich Little]] and [[David Frye]]. Although Capp's endorsement activities never rivaled Li'l Abner's or Fearless Fosdick's, he was a celebrity spokesman in print ads for Sheaffer Snorkel fountain pens (along with colleagues and close friends [[Milton Caniff]] and Walt Kelly), and‚Äîwith an irony that would become apparent later‚Äîa brand of cigarettes, ([[Chesterfield cigarettes|Chesterfield]]).

Capp would resume visiting war amputees during the [[Korean War]] and [[Vietnam War]]. He toured Vietnam with the [[USO]], entertaining troops along with [[Art Buchwald]] and [[George Plimpton]]. He served as chairman of the Cartoonists' Committee in President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]'s People-to-People program in 1954 (although Capp had actually supported [[Adlai Stevenson]] for president in 1952 and 1956),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reuben.org/ncs/members/memorium/capp.jpg Al Capp's biography card from the National Cartoonists Society]&lt;/ref&gt; which was organized to promote [[Savings Bond]]s for the [[U.S. Treasury]]. Capp had earlier provided the Shmoo for a special Children's Savings Bond in 1949, accompanying President [[Harry S. Truman]] at the bond's unveiling ceremony. During the [[Soviet Union]]'s blockade of [[West Berlin]] in 1948, the commanders of the Berlin airlift had cabled Capp, requesting inflatable shmoos as part of &quot;Operation: Little Vittles&quot;. Candy-filled shmoos were air-dropped to hungry West Berliners by America's 17th Military Airport Squadron during the [[humanitarian]] effort. &quot;When the candy-chocked shmoos were dropped, a near-riot resulted,&quot; (reported in ''[[Newsweek]]''‚ÄîOctober 11, 1948).

In addition to his public service work for charitable organizations for the handicapped, Capp also served on the National Reading Council, which was organized to combat illiteracy. He published a column (&quot;Wrong Turn Onto Sesame Street&quot;) challenging federally funded [[Public Television]] endowments in favor of educational comics‚Äîwhich, according to Capp, &quot;didn't cost a dime in taxes and never had. I pointed out that a kid could enjoy ''[[Sesame Street]]'' ''without'' learning how to read, but he couldn't enjoy comic strips ''unless'' he could read; and that a smaller investment in getting kids to read by supplying them with educational matter in such ''reading'' form might make better sense.&quot; 

&quot;Comics,‚Äù wrote Capp in 1970, ‚Äúcan be a combination of the highest quality of art and text, and many of them are.‚Äù Capp would produce many giveaway educational comic books and [[public services]] pamphlets, spanning several decades, for the [[American Red Cross|Red Cross]], the [[United States civil defense|Department of Civil Defense]], the [[United States Department of the Navy|Department of the Navy]], the [[U.S. Army]], the [[Anti-Defamation League]], the [[United States Department of Labor|Department of Labor]], [[Community Chest (organization)|Community Chest]] (a forerunner of [[United Way of America|United Way]]), and the [[Job Corps]]. Capp's studio provided special artwork for various civic groups and [[non-profit organizations]] as well. Dogpatch characters were used in national campaigns for the Cancer Foundation, the [[March of Dimes]], the National Heart Fund, the [[Boy Scouts of America]], Minnesota Tuberculosis and Health Association, the National Amputation Foundation, and [[Disabled American Veterans]], among others. They were also used to help sell [[Christmas Seals]].
 
In August 1967 Capp was the narrator and host of a network special called ''Do Blonds Have More Fun?'' In 1970, he was the subject of a provocative NBC documentary called ''This Is Al Capp''. Capp was the ''[[Playboy]]'' interview subject in the December 1965 issue of that magazine.

==The 1960s and 1970s==
Capp, who by all accounts was contrary and contentious by nature, was a maverick politically. Characteristically, he went against the grain. He was a [[liberalism|liberal]] during the conservative 1950s, only to switch to [[Conservatism|conservative]] during the liberal, hippie-era 1960s.

Capp and his family lived in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] near [[Harvard]] during the entire Vietnam War protest era. The turmoil that Americans were watching on their TV sets was happening live‚Äîright in his own neighborhood. Campus [[Far left|radicals]] and ‚Äú[[hippies]]‚Äù inevitably became one of Capp‚Äôs favorite targets in the sixties. Alongside his long-established caricatures of right-wing, big business types such as General Bullmoose and J. Roaringham Fatback, Capp began spoofing [[counterculture]] icons such as [[Joan Baez]] (in the character of Joanie Phoanie, a wealthy folksinger who offers an impoverished orphanage ten thousand dollars' worth of &quot;protest songs&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,843312,00.html Which One Is the Phoanie? - Time]&lt;/ref&gt; The sequence implicitly labeled Baez a [[limousine liberal]], a charge she took to heart, as detailed years later in her 1987 autobiography, ''And A Voice To Sing With: A Memoir''. Another target was Senator Ted Kennedy, parodied as &quot;Senator O. Noble McGesture&quot;, resident of &quot;Hyideelsport.&quot; The town name is a play on [[Hyannisport, Massachusetts]], where a number of the Kennedy clan have lived.

Capp became a popular public speaker on college campuses, where he reportedly relished hecklers. He attacked militant antiwar demonstrators, both in his personal appearances and in his strip. He also satirized student political groups. The [[Youth International Party]] (YIP) and [[Students for a Democratic Society (1960 organization)|Students for a Democratic Society]] (SDS) emerged in ''Li'l Abner'' as &quot;Students Wildly Indignant about Nearly Everything!&quot; (SWINE). In an April 1969 letter to ''Time'', Capp insisted, &quot;The students I blast are not the dissenters, but the destroyers‚Äîthe less than 4% who lock up deans in washrooms, who burn manuscripts of unpublished books, who make combination pigpens and playpens of their universities. The remaining 96% detest them as heartily as I do&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,844734-3,00.html Letters page April 18, 1969 - TIME]&lt;/ref&gt;

Capp's increasingly controversial remarks at his campus speeches and during TV appearances cost him his semi-regular spot on the ''Tonight Show''. His contentious public persona during this period was captured on a late sixties comedy LP called ''Al Capp On Campus''. The album features his interaction with students at Fresno State College (now [[California State University, Fresno]]) on such topics as &quot;sensitivity training&quot;, &quot;humanitarianism&quot;, &quot;abstract art&quot; (Capp hated it), and of course &quot;student protest&quot;. The cover features a cartoon drawing by Capp of wildly dressed, angry hippies carrying protest signs with slogans like &quot;End Capp Brutality&quot;, &quot;Abner and Daisy Mae Smoke Pot&quot;, &quot;Capp Is Over [30, 40, 50‚Äîall crossed out] the Hill!!&quot;, and &quot;If You Like Crap, You'll Like Capp!&quot;

Highlights of the strip's final decades include &quot;Boomchik&quot; (1961) in which America's international prestige is saved by Mammy Yokum, &quot;Daisy Mae Steps Out&quot; (1966), a female-empowering tale of Daisy's brazenly audacious ‚Äúhomewrecker gland&quot;, &quot;The Lips of Marcia Perkins&quot; (1967), a satirical, thinly-veiled commentary on [[venereal disease]] and public health warnings, &quot;Ignoble Savages&quot; (1968), in which [[Mafia|the mob]] takes over Harvard, and &quot;Corporal Crock&quot; (1973), in which Bullmoose reveals his reactionary cartoon role model, in a tale of obsession and the fanatical world of comic book collecting.

The cartoonist visited [[John Lennon]] and [[Yoko Ono]] at their 1969 [[Bed-In for Peace]] in [[Montreal]], and their testy exchange later appeared in the documentary film ''[[Imagine: John Lennon]]'' (1988). Introducing himself with the words &quot;I'm a dreadful Neanderthal fascist. How do you do?&quot;, Capp sardonically congratulated Lennon and Ono on their ''[[Unfinished Music No. 1: Two Virgins|Two Virgins]]'' nude album cover: &quot;I think that everybody owes it to the world to prove they have pubic hair. You've done it, and I tell you that I applaud you for it.&quot; Following this exchange, Capp insulted Ono (&quot;Good God, you've gotta live with that?&quot;), and is asked to &quot;get out&quot; by Derek Taylor. Lennon allowed him to stay however, but the conversation had soured considerably. On Capp's exit, Lennon sang an impromptu version of his ''[[Ballad of John and Yoko]]'' song with a slightly revised, but nonetheless prophetic lyric: &quot;Christ, you know it ain't easy / You know how hard it can be / The way things are goin' / They're gonna crucify ''Capp!'' &quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.script-o-rama.com/movie_scripts/i/imagine-john-lennon-script-transcript.html Imagine: John Lennon Script - transcript from the screenplay and/or documentary movie about John Lennon]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to an [[apocryphal]] tale from this era, in a televised face-off, either Capp (on the ''[[Dick Cavett Show]]'') or (more commonly) conservative talk show host [[Joe Pyne]] (on his own show) is supposed to have taunted iconoclastic musician [[Frank Zappa]] about his long hair, asking Zappa if he thought he was a girl. Zappa is said to have replied, &quot;You have a wooden leg; does that make you a table?&quot; (Both Capp and Pyne had wooden legs). The story is considered an [[urban legend]].

In 1968, a [[theme park]] called [[Dogpatch USA]] opened at Marble Falls, [[Arkansas]], based on Capp's work and with his support. The park was a popular attraction during the 1970s, but was abandoned in 1993 due to financial difficulties. As of late 2005, the area once devoted to a live-action facsimile of Dogpatch (including a lifesize statue in the town square of Dogpatch &quot;founder&quot;, General Jubilation T. Cornpone) has been heavily stripped by vandals and souvenir hunters, and is today slowly being reclaimed by the surrounding Arkansas wilderness.

In 1971, syndicated [[columnist]]s [[Jack Anderson (columnist)|Jack Anderson]] and [[Brit Hume]] published an article alleging instances of sexual harassment by Al Capp of students on his lecture tour.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.al-capp-lil-abner.com/ Lil Abner &amp; Al Capp History]&lt;/ref&gt; Capp soon became involved in a scandal after allegedly propositioning a married student from the [[University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison]] in Capp‚Äôs [[Eau Claire, Wisconsin|Eau Claire]] hotel room. After being charged in the incident, Capp pleaded ''[[nolo contendere]]'' to &quot;attempted adultery‚Äù (adultery was, and as of 2008 still is considered a felony in Wisconsin) and was fined $500.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vanwagnerwood.com/CM/Custom/Adultery.asp Adultery is a crime in Wisconsin | Law Offices of criminal defense attorneys Christopher Van Wagner and Tracey Wood, Madison WI]&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting publicity led to hundreds of papers dropping his comic strip,&lt;ref name=&quot;salon&quot;&gt;[http://dir.salon.com/story/books/feature/2002/09/30/capp/index.html?pn= Dogpatch confidential - Salon.com]&lt;/ref&gt; and Capp, already in failing health, withdrew from public speaking.

Years later, on ''[[Inside the Actor's Studio]]'', [[Goldie Hawn]] claimed that Capp had sexually propositioned her during her auditions for the [[1964 New York World's Fair]]; other actresses who have made similar allegations include [[Grace Kelly]] (unsubstantiated) and [[Edie Adams]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}

&quot;From beginning to end, Capp was acid-tongued toward the targets of his wit, intolerant of hypocrisy, and always wickedly funny. After about 40 years, however, Capp's interest in ''Abner'' waned, and this showed in the strip itself,&quot; according to [[Don Markstein]]'s ''[[Toonopedia]]''. On November 13, 1977, Capp retired with an apology to his fans for the recently declining quality of the strip, which he said had been the best he could manage due to declining health. &quot;If you have any sense of humor about your strip‚Äîand I had a sense of humor about mine‚Äîyou knew that for three or four years ''Abner'' was wrong. Oh hell, it's like a fighter retiring. I stayed on longer than I should have,&quot; he admitted,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,948819,00.html Mr. Dogpatch - 1979 TIME obituary]&lt;/ref&gt; adding that he couldn't breathe anymore. &quot;When he retired ''Li'l Abner'', newspapers ran expansive articles and television commentators talked about the passing of an era. ''[[People magazine]]'' ran a substantial feature, and even the comics-free ''[[New York Times]]'' devoted nearly a full page to the event,&quot; wrote publisher [[Denis Kitchen]].

Capp's final years were marked by advancing illness and by family tragedy, with the unexpected deaths of one of his two daughters and a beloved granddaughter. A lifelong chain smoker, Capp died in 1979 from [[emphysema]] at his home in [[South Hampton, New Hampshire]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newburyportnews.com/local/x546276190/Al-Capp-was-here Al Capp Was Here ''Newburyport Daily News'' Sept. 27, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; Capp is buried in Mount Prospect Cemetery in Amesbury, Massachusetts. Engraved on his headstone is a stanza from [[Thomas Gray]]: ''The plowman homeward plods his weary way / And leaves the world to darkness and to me'' (from &quot;[[Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard]]&quot;, 1751).

==Legacy==
Neither the strip's shifting political leanings nor the slide of its final few years had any bearing on its status as a classic, and in 1995, ''Li'l Abner'' was recognized as such by the [[United States Postal Service]]. ''Li'l Abner'' was one of 20 [[Comic Strip Classics|classic American comic strips]] honored with a USPS [[commemorative postage stamp]]. Al Capp, an inductee into the [[National Cartoon Museum]], (formerly the International Museum of Cartoon Art) is one of only 31 artists selected to their [[Hall of Fame]]. Capp was also inducted into the [[Will Eisner Award]] Hall of Fame in 2004. ''[[The Chicago Tribune]]'' called Capp a &quot;wry, ornery, brilliantly perceptive satirist will go down as one of the Great American Humorists&quot; (2002).

[[Sadie Hawkins Day]] and [[:wikt:double whammy|double whammy]] are two terms attributed to Al Capp that have entered the [[English language]]. Other, less ubiquitous Cappisms include [[skunk works]] and [[Lower Slobbovia]]. The term [[shmoo]] has also entered the [[lexicon]], defining highly technical concepts in no less than ''four'' separate fields of science, including the variations [[Mating of yeast|shmooing]] (a [[microbiological]] term for the &quot;budding&quot; process in yeast reproduction), and [[shmoo plot]] (a technical term in the field of [[electrical engineering]]). In [[socioeconomics]], a &quot;shmoo&quot; refers to any generic kind of good that reproduces itself, (as opposed to &quot;[[widget (economics)|widget]]s&quot; which require resources and active production.) In the field of [[particle physics]], &quot;shmoo&quot; refers to a high energy survey instrument, as utilized at the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] to capture subatomic [[cosmic ray]] particles emitted from the [[Cygnus X-3]] [[constellation]]. Capp also had a knack for popularizing certain uncommon terms, such as [[List of American words not widely used in the United Kingdom|druthers]], [[schmooze]] and [[-nik|nogoodnik, neatnik, etc.]] In his book ''[[The American Language]]'', [[H.L. Mencken]] credits the postwar mania for adding &quot;-nik&quot; to the ends of adjectives to create nouns as beginning‚Äînot with [[beatnik]] or [[Sputnik]]‚Äîbut earlier, in the pages of ''Li'l Abner''.

Al Capp's life and career are the subjects of a new life-sized [[mural]] commemorating his 100th birthday, unveiled in downtown Amesbury on May 15, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newburyportnews.com/local/x1612544031/Town-to-honor-famous-cartoonist-who-lived-worked-in-Amesbury#comment-45683673 Town to Honor Famous Cartoonist Who Lived, Worked in Amesbury ''Newburyport Daily News'' April 20, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boston.com/ae/theater_arts/articles/2010/05/15/amesbury_gives_lil_abner_his_due/?page=full Amesbury Gives Li'l Abner His Due ''Boston Globe'' May 15, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''[[Boston Globe]]'' (as reported on May 18, 2010), the town has renamed its amphitheater in the artist's honor, and is looking to develop an Al Capp Museum. Capp is also the subject of an upcoming [[WNET-TV]] ''[[American Masters]]'' [[documentary]], ''The Life and Times of Al Capp'', produced by his granddaughter, independent filmmaker Caitlin Manning.

Since his death in 1979, Al Capp and his work have been the subject of more than 40 books, including three biographies. [[Underground comix|Underground cartoonist]] and ''Li'l Abner'' expert [[Denis Kitchen]] has published, co-published, edited, or otherwise served as consultant on nearly all of them. Kitchen is currently compiling a [[monograph]] on Al Capp. 

At the [[San Diego Comic Con]] in July 2009, [[IDW Publishing|IDW]] announced the upcoming publication of ''Al Capp's Li'l Abner: The Complete Dailies and Color Sundays'' as part of their ongoing [[Library of American Comics]] project. The comprehensive series, a reprinting of the entire 43-year history of ''Li'l Abner'' spanning a projected 21 volumes, began on April 7, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.libraryofamericancomics.com/catalog/series/1101/ IDW Library of American Comics]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ann Druyan''' (born June 13, 1949) is an [[United States|American]] [[author]] and producer specializing in productions about [[cosmology]] and [[popular science]]. She made substantial contributions to the [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] [[Documentary film|documentary]] series ''[[Cosmos: A Personal Voyage|Cosmos]]'' and is perhaps best known as the wife of late [[scientist]] and [[Teacher|educator]] [[Carl Sagan]].

==Film career==
Along with Carl Sagan and [[Steven Soter]], Druyan was one of the writers for the television series ''[[Cosmos: A Personal Voyage|Cosmos]]'' and a producer for the film ''[[Contact (film)|Contact]]''.

She is the CEO and co-founder of [[Cosmos Studios]]. In 2007 she was said to be working on an IMAX film on global warming as well as a sequel to Cosmos. In 2009 Druyan released a series of podcasts entitled ''At Home in the Cosmos with Annie Druyan'' in which she describes in detail the life of husband [[Carl Sagan]], her works, and their marriage.

==Career as an author==
Druyan and Sagan co-wrote the books ''[[Comet (book)|Comet]]'', ''[[Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors (book)|Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors]]'', and sections of ''[[The Demon-Haunted World]]''. She also wrote the updated introduction to Sagan's ''[[The Cosmic Connection]]'', the epilogue to ''[[Billions and Billions: Thoughts on Life and Death at the Brink of the Millennium|Billions and Billions]]'', and her solo novel ''[[A Famous Broken Heart]]''.

==Career as a scientist==
As a scientist, Druyan was responsible for the selection of music on the [[Voyager Golden Record]] for the [[Voyager 1]] and [[Voyager 2]] exploratory missions. She also sponsored the ''[[Cosmos 1]]'' spacecraft, which intended to demonstrate [[solar sail]] propulsion technology as a means of interstellar space travel. Unfortunately, The ''Cosmos 1'' had a sub-orbital launch failure when the modified Soviet submarine missile used as a launch vehicle malfunctioned.

==Activism==
Druyan has served on the Board of Directors of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws [[National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws|NORML]] for over 10 years,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
  | title =About NORML, Ann Druyan
  | url =http://norml.org/index.cfm?Group_ID=4493
  | accessdate = 2007-12-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is also the current president of the NORML Foundation Board of Directors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

  | accessdate = 2007-12-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honors==
In November 2006, Druyan was a speaker at ''[[Beyond Belief: Science, Religion, Reason and Survival]]''.

In January 2007, she was a juror at the [[2007 Sundance Film Festival]], responsible for selecting the winner of the [[Alfred P. Sloan Prize]] for films about science and technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

  | work =[[Sundance Film Festival]]
  | accessdate = 2007-10-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious and philosophical views==
As an [[agnostic]], Druyan holds that belief in a [[deity]] is not necessary to a healthy appreciation for life and a sense of unity with the [[universe]].

In an interview with Joel Achenbach of the ''Washington Post'', Druyan stated that her early interest in science stemmed from a fascination with [[Karl Marx]]. Achenbach commented that &quot;She had, at the time, rather vaporous standards of evidence,&quot; a reference to her belief in the ancient astronauts of [[Erich von Daniken]] and the theories of [[Immanuel Velikovsky]] pertaining to the solar system.&lt;ref&gt;Achenbach, Joel (1999). ''Captured by Aliens: the search for life and truth in a very large universe''. New York: Simon &amp; Schuster. ISBN 0684848562. pp. 95-6:  &quot;Her interest in science came primarily from her interest in the philosophy of Karl Marx. . . . Druyan herself had, at the time, rather vaporous standards of evidence for her many sundry beliefs (as she later acknowledged). She believed . . . that Immanuel Velikovsky in the 1950s had correctly deduced the truth about the solar system. . . . She believed in the ancient astronauts of Erich von Daniken.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;  Druyan freely acknowledged her past views but also asserted that they changed dramatically after marrying [[Carl Sagan]].

==Notable quotations==
{{Copy to Wikiquote}}
{{Quote|&quot;'''It is a great tragedy that science, this wonderful process for finding out what is true, has ceded the spiritual uplift of its central revelations: the vastness of the universe, the immensity of time, the relatedness of all life, and life‚Äôs preciousness on our tiny planet.'''&quot;|Ann Druyan interviewed by the [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]]|&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csicop.org/si/show/ann_druyan_talks_about_science_religion/]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{Quote|&quot;'''I really believe that the marijuana laws are a terrible injustice. They make no sense scientifically, ethically, legally, or any way.''' They cost a fortune to enforce and we incarcerate hundreds of thousands of people who have done nothing else, but possess or distribute marijuana. Maybe it's because I'm a child of the 60's and marijuana has been such a positive part of my life. I have never seen it as being addictive, having spent weeks, and months, and days of my life (and years) without using marijuana in any form.

For me, it's a kind of a sacrament, something that should be used wisely and in the context of a loving family existence. '''There's a place for alcohol too, but there's no reason why adults shouldn't be allowed to do something which not only doesn't add harm to themselves or others, but is a way to enhance the beauty of life, the beauty of eating, of listening to music, of being with friends and family, of being with the one you love.'''&quot;|Ann Druyan in the [[video podcast]] ''At Home in the Cosmos with Annie Druyan''|&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.podjockey.com/members/cosmos/]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{Quote|&quot;When my husband died, because he was so famous and known for not being a believer, many people would come up to me‚Äîit still sometimes happens‚Äîand ask me if Carl changed at the end and converted to a belief in an afterlife. They also frequently ask me if I think I will see him again. Carl faced his death with unflagging courage and never sought refuge in illusions. The tragedy was that we knew we would never see each other again. I don't ever expect to be reunited with Carl.&quot;|Ann Druyan in the [[Notable Names Database]]|&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nndb.com/people/291/000026213/]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{Quote|&quot;I think the roots of this antagonism to science run very deep. They're ancient. We see them in Genesis, this first story, this [[founding myth]] of ours, in which the first humans are doomed and cursed eternally for asking a question, for partaking of the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge. It's puzzling that Eden is synonymous with paradise when, if you think about it at all, it's more like a maximum-security prison with twenty-four hour surveillance. It's a horrible place. '''Adam and Eve have no childhood. They awaken full-grown. What is a human being without a childhood? Our long childhood is a critical feature of our species. It differentiates us, to a degree, from most other species. We take a longer time to mature. We depend upon these formative years and the social fabric to learn many of the things we need to know.'''&quot;|Ann Druyan interviewed by the [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]]|&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csicop.org/si/show/ann_druyan_talks_about_science_religion/ Ann Druyan Talks About Science, Religion, Wonder, Awe... and Carl Sagan]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Analcime''' or '''analcite''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''analkimos'' - &quot;weak&quot;) is a white, grey, or colourless [[Silicate minerals|tectosilicate]] [[mineral]].  Analcime consists of hydrated [[sodium]] [[aluminium]] [[silicate]] in cubic [[crystal]]line form. Its [[chemical formula]] is [[sodium|Na]][[aluminium|Al]][[silicon|Si]]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[[oxygen|O]]&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;'''¬∑'''[[water (molecule)|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O]]. Minor amounts of [[potassium]] and [[calcium]] substitute for sodium. A [[silver]]-bearing synthetic variety also exists (Ag-analcite).

Analcime is usually classified as a [[zeolite]] mineral, but structurally and chemically it is more similar to the [[feldspathoid]]s. Analcime occurs as a primary mineral in analcime [[basalt]] and other alkaline [[igneous rocks]]. It also occurs as cavity and vesicle fillings associated with [[prehnite]], [[calcite]], and zeolites.

Locations include the [[Cyclopean Islands]] east off [[Sicily]] and near [[Trentino]] in northern [[Italy]]; [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] in [[Australia]]; [[Kerguelen Island]] in the [[Indian Ocean]]; in the [[Lake Superior]] copper district of [[Michigan]], Bergen Hill, [[New Jersey]], [[Golden, Colorado]], and at [[Searles Lake]], [[California]] in the [[United States]]; and at Cape Blomidon, [[Nova Scotia]] and [[Mont Saint-Hilaire]], [[Quebec]] in [[Canada]]; and in [[Iceland]].

Despite being the developer of Tetris, Pajitnov did not profit from his creation, as rights were owned by his employer, the Soviet government, which distributed it freely throughout the USSR and Eastern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=4 maart 2009 |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zidxG-ah3y8 |title=Tetris 1985 History of Games part 07 |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2009-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; He only started profiting from his creation by 1996 when he and [[Henk Rogers]] formed [[The Tetris Company]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.atarihq.com/tsr/special/tetrishist.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Alexey Pajitnov created ''Tetris'' with the help of Dmitry Pavlovsky and [[Vadim Gerasimov]] in 1985. The game, first available in the Soviet Union, appeared in [[Western world|the West]] in 1986.
Pajitnov also created the lesser known sequel to ''Tetris'', entitled ''[[Welltris]]'', which has the same principle but in a [[3D computer graphics|three dimensional]] environment where you see the &quot;board&quot; from above.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mds.mdh.se/~frv95pen/game/tetris/welltris/ |title=Screenshots from Welltris, retrieved 31-10-2007 |publisher=Mds.mdh.se |date= |accessdate=2009-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Tetris'' was licensed and managed by Soviet company Elorg which had been founded specially for this purpose, and advertised with the slogan ''&quot;From Russia with Love&quot;'' (on NES: ''&quot;From Russia With Fun!&quot;''). Because he was employed by the Soviet government, Pajitnov did not receive royalties. Pajitnov, together with [[Vladimir Pokhilko]], moved to the [[United States]] in 1991 and later, in 1996, founded ''The Tetris Company'' with Henk Rogers.

He helped design the puzzles in the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]] versions of ''[[Yoshi's Cookie]]'' and designed the game ''[[Pandora's Box (computer game)|Pandora's Box]]'', which incorporates more traditional [[jigsaw puzzle|jigsaw-style puzzles]].

He began working for [[Microsoft]] in October 1996. Pajitnov worked for the [[Microsoft Entertainment Pack: The Puzzle Collection]], MSN Mind Aerobics and [[MSN Games]] groups. Pajitnov's new, enhanced version of ''[[Hexic]]'', ''Hexic HD'', was included with every new [[Xbox 360]] Premium package. He left Microsoft in 2005.

On August 18, 2005 WildSnake Software announced Pajitnov will be collaborating with them to release a new line of puzzle games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wildsnake.com/newsletter/2005-08-18/ |title=WildSnake newsletter august 18 2005, retrieved 31-10-2007 |publisher=Wildsnake.com |date=2005-08-18 |accessdate=2009-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Bah√°'√≠}}
'''‚ÄòAbdu‚Äôl-Bah√°''' ('''{{lang|ar|ÿπÿ®ÿØ ÿßŸÑÿ®Ÿáÿßÿ°}}'''&amp;lrm;) (23 May 1844 - 28 November 1921), born '''‚ÄòAbb√°s Effend√≠''', was the eldest son of [[Bah√°'u'll√°h]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Chambers Biographical Dictionary]], ISBN 0-550-18022-2, page 2&lt;/ref&gt; the founder of the [[Bah√°'√≠ Faith]]. In 1892, `Abdu'l-Bah√° was appointed in his father's [[Tablets of Bah√°'u'll√°h#Kit√°b-i-`Ahd (Book of the Covenant)|will]] to be his successor and head of the Bah√°'√≠ Faith.&lt;ref name=&quot;iranica_abdulbaha_b&quot;&gt;{{Citation |encyclopedia= Encyclop√¶dia Iranica |year= 1989 |article=‚ÄòAbd-al-BahƒÅ‚Äô : Life and work | url = http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/unicode/v1f1/v1f1a064.html | first = Alessandro | last = Bausani |postscript= .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith 2000 14‚Äì20&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|2000|pp=14‚Äì20}}&lt;/ref&gt; `Abdu'l-Bah√° was born in [[Tehran]] to an aristocratic family of the realm. At the age of eight his father was imprisoned and the family's possessions were looted, leaving them in virtual poverty. Along with his father, `Abdu'l-Bah√° was exiled to [[Baghdad]] where the family lived for nine years. In 1863 Bah√°'u'll√°h was again exiled to [[Constantinople]]. During the 1860s the family was banished from Constantinople to [[Adrianople]], and then finally to the penal-colony of [[Acre, Palestine]] when he was 24. During his youth he was &quot;shaped&quot; by his father and was regarded as an outstanding member of the Bah√°‚Äô√≠ exile community. As a teenager he was his father‚Äôs amanuensis and was regularly seen debating theological issues with the learned men of the area. 

With his father's death in 1892, and his appointment as head of the Bah√°‚Äô√≠ faith, there was much opposition against him, including virtually all his family members. Notwithstanding this practically all of the worldwide Bah√°‚Äô√≠ community accepted his leadership. By the age of 64 after forty years imprisonment `Abdu‚Äôl-Bah√° was freed by the [[Young Turks]] and he and his family began to live in relative safety. His [[`Abdu'l-Bah√°'s journeys to the West|journeys to the West]], and his &quot;[[Tablets of the Divine Plan]]&quot; spread the Bah√°'√≠ message beyond its middle-eastern roots, and his [[Will and Testament of `Abdu'l-Bah√°|Will and Testament]] laid the foundation for the current &quot;[[Bah√°'√≠ administration|Bah√°'√≠ administrative order]]. Many of his writings, prayers and letters are extant, and his discourses with the Western Bah√°'√≠s emphasize the growth of the faith by the late 1890s. `Abdu'l-Bah√°'s [[given name]] was `Abb√°s, but he preferred the title of `Abdu'l-Bah√° (servant of the glory of God). He is commonly referred to in Bah√°'√≠ texts as &quot;The Master&quot;, and received the title of [[Order of the British Empire|KBE]] after his personal storage of grain was used to relieve famine in [[Palestine]] following [[World War I]], but never used the title.

==Early life==
`Abdu'l-Bah√° was born in [[Tehran]], [[Iran]] on 23 May 1844 (5th of [[Jumada al-awwal|Jamadiyu'l-Avval]], 1260 AH),&lt;ref name=&quot;Qazvini&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://bahai-library.com/qazvini_abdulbaha_prominent_iranians |title= `Abdu'l-Bah√° Meeting with Two Prominent Iranians |accessdate=2007-09-05 | author= Muhammad Qazvini |year= 1949 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the eldest son of [[Bah√°'u'll√°h]] and [[√Ås√≠yih Kh√°num|Navv√°b]]. He was born on the very same night on which the [[B√°b]] declared his mission.&lt;ref name=&quot;bne&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Esslemont|1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; Born with the given name of `Abb√°s,&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith 2000 14‚Äì20&quot;/&gt; he was named after his grandfather [[M√≠rz√° `Abb√°s N√∫r√≠]], a prominent and powerful nobleman.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harvnb|Kazemzadeh|2009&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Kazemzadeh|2009|}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a child, `Abdu'l-Bah√° was shaped by his father's position as a prominent [[B√°b√≠]]. He recalled how he met the B√°b√≠ leader [[T√°hirih]] and how she would take &quot;me on to her knee, caress me, and talk to me. I admired her most deeply&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Blomfield|1975|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; `Abdu‚Äôl-Bah√° had a happy and carefree childhood. The family‚Äôs Tehran home and country houses were comfortable and beautifully decorated. `Abdu'l-Bah√° enjoyed playing in the gardens with his younger sister whom he was very close to.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blomfield 1975 40&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Blomfield|1975|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with his younger siblings‚Äî a sister, [[Bah√≠yyih Kh√°num|Bah√≠yyih]], and a brother, [[M√≠rz√° Mihd√≠|Mihd√≠]]‚Äî the three lived in a environment of privilege, happiness and comfort.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harvnb|Kazemzadeh|2009&quot;/&gt; With his father's declination of the position as minister of the court; during his young boyhood `Abdu‚Äôl-Bah√° witnessed his parents' various charitable endeavours,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Blomfield|1975|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; which included converting part of the home to a hospital ward for women and children.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blomfield 1975 40&quot;/&gt;   

`Abdu'l-Bah√° received a haphazard education during his childhood. It was customary not to send children of nobility to schools. Most noblemen were educated at home briefly in scripture, rhetoric, calligraphy and basic mathematics. Many were educated to prepare themselves for life in the royal court. Despite a brief spell at a traditional preparatory school at the age of seven for one year,&lt;ref&gt;Taherzadeh, p.105&lt;/ref&gt; `Abdu'l-Bah√° received no formal education. As he grew he was educated by his mother, and uncle.&lt;ref&gt;Blomfield, p.68&lt;/ref&gt; Most of his education however, came from his father.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hogenson|2010|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Years later in 1890 [[Edward Granville Browne]] described how `Abdu'l-Bah√° was &quot;one more eloquent of speech, more ready of argument, more apt of illustration, more intimately acquainted with the sacred books of the Jews, the Christians, and the Muhammadans...scarcely be found even amongst the eloquent.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|1891|p=xxxvi}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

When `Abdu'l-Bah√° was seven, he contracted tuberculosis and was expected to die.&lt;ref&gt;Hogenson, p.81&lt;/ref&gt; Though the malady faded away,&lt;ref&gt;Balyuzi, p.12&lt;/ref&gt; he would be plagued with bouts illness for the rest of his life.&lt;ref&gt;Hogenson, p.82&lt;/ref&gt;  

One event that affected `Abdu'l-Bah√° greatly during his childhood was the imprisonment of his father when `Abdu'l-Bah√° was eight years old; the imprisonment led to his family being reduced to poverty and being attacked in the streets by other children.&lt;ref name=&quot;bne&quot; /&gt; `Abdu'l-Bah√° accompanied his mother to visit [[Bah√°'u'll√°h]] who was then imprisoned in the infamous subterranean dungeon the [[S√≠y√°h-Ch√°l]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Harvnb|Kazemzadeh|2009&quot;/&gt; He described how &quot;I saw a dark, steep place. We entered a small, narrow doorway, and went down two steps, but beyond those one could see nothing. In the middle of the stairway, all of a sudden we heard His [Bah√°‚Äôu‚Äôll√°h's]‚Ä¶voice: 'Do not bring him in here', and so they took me back&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;b_p12&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Balyuzi|2001|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Baghdad ==
Bah√°'u'll√°h was eventually released from prison but ordered into exile, and `Abdu'l-Bah√° then eight joined his father on the journey to [[Baghdad]] in the winter (January to April)&lt;ref name=&quot;Winter'sChron&quot;&gt;[http://bahai-library.com/winters_chronology_babi_persecutions Chronology of persecutions of Babis and Baha'is] compiled by Jonah Winters&lt;/ref&gt; of 1853.&lt;ref name=&quot;b_p12&quot;/&gt; During the journey `Abdu'l-Bah√° suffered from frost-bite. After a year of difficulties Bah√°'u'll√°h absented himself rather than continue to face the conflict with [[Mirza Yahya]] and secretly secluded himself in the mountains of [[Sulaymaniyah]] in April 1854 a month before `Abdu'l-Bah√°'s tenth birthday.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winter'sChron&quot;/&gt; Mutual sorrow resulted in him, his [[√Ås√≠yih Kh√°num|mother]] and [[Bahiyyih Kh√°num|sister]] becoming constant companions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Blomfield|1975|p=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; `Abdu'l-Bah√° was particularly close to both, and his mother took active participation in his education and upbringing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blomfield 1975 69&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Blomfield|1975|p=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the two year absence of his father `Abdu'l-Bah√° took up the duty of managing the affairs of the family,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peyman.info/cl/Baha'i/Others/ROB/V2/p388-396Ch18.html The Revelation of Bah√°'u'll√°h, volume two], page 391&lt;/ref&gt; before his [[age of maturity]] (14 in middle-eastern society)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unrisd.org/unrisd/website/document.nsf/8b18431d756b708580256b6400399775/2e975aca2a81aa54c12576580028735c/$FILE/WebIran.pdf Can women act as agents of a democratization of theocracy in Iran?] by Homa Hoodfar, Shadi Sadr, page 9&lt;/ref&gt; and was known to be occupied with reading and, at a time of hand-copied scriptures being the primary means of publishing,{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} was also engaged in copying the writings of the [[B√°b]].&lt;ref name=&quot;b_p14&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Balyuzi|2001|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; `Abdu‚Äôl-Bah√° also took an interest in the art of horse riding and, as he grew, became a renowned rider.&lt;ref name=&quot;lotoae&quot; /&gt;

In 1856, news of an ascetic carrying on discourses with local S√∫f√≠ leaders that seemed to possibly be Bah√°'u'll√°h reached the family and friends. Immediately, family members and friends went to search for the illusive dervish ‚Äì and in March&lt;ref name=&quot;Winter'sChron&quot;/&gt; bought Bah√°'u'll√°h back to Baghdad.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith17&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|2008|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; On seeing his father, `Abdu'l-Bah√° fell to his knees and wept loudly &quot;Why did you leave us?&quot;, and this followed with his mother and sister doing the same.&lt;ref name=&quot;lotoae&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;b_p15&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Balyuzi|2001|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; `Abdu'l-Bah√° soon became his fathers secretary and shield.&lt;ref name=&quot;bne&quot; /&gt; During the sojourn in the city `Abdu‚Äôl-Bah√° grew from a boy into a young man. He was noted as a &quot;remarkably fine looking youth&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;lotoae&quot; /&gt; and remembered for his charity and amiableness.&lt;ref name=&quot;bne&quot; /&gt; Having passed the age of maturity `Abdu'l-Bah√° was regularly seen in the mosques of Baghdad discussing religious topics and the scripture as a young man. Whilst in Baghdad, `Abdu'l-Bah√° composed a commentary at the request of his father on the Muslim tradition of &quot;I was a Hidden Treasure&quot; for a S√∫f√≠ leader named `Al√≠ Shawkat P√°sh√°.&lt;ref name=&quot;bne&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;iwaht&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = 'Abdu'l-Baha's Commentary on The Islamic Tradition: &quot;I Was a Hidden Treasure ...&quot; | url = http://bahai-library.com/abdulbaha_kuntu_kanzan_makhfiyyan | publisher = Baha'i Studies Bulletin 3:4 (Dec. 1985), 4-35| accessdate=2009-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; `Abdu'l-Bah√° was fifteen or sixteen at the time and `Al√≠ Shawkat P√°sh√° regarded the more than 11000 word essay as a remarkable feat for somebody of his age.&lt;ref name=&quot;bne&quot; /&gt; In 1863 in what became known as the [[Garden of Ridv√°n, Baghdad|Garden of Ridv√°n]] Bah√°'u'll√°h announced to a few that he was the [[manifestation of God]] and [[He whom God shall make manifest]] whose coming had been foretold by the [[B√°b]].

In 1863 Bah√°'u'll√°h was summoned to [[Constantinople]] ([[Istanbul]]), and thus his whole family including `Abdu'l-Bah√°, then nineteen, accompanied him on his 110-day journey.&lt;ref name=&quot;b_p17&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Balyuzi|2001|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The journey to Constantinople was another wearisome  journey,&lt;ref name=&quot;lotoae&quot; /&gt; and `Abdu'l-Bah√° helped feed the exiles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harvnb|Kazemzadeh|2009&quot;/&gt; It was here that his position became more prominent amongst the Bah√°‚Äô√≠s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith 2000 14‚Äì20&quot;/&gt; This was further solidified by [[Bah√°‚Äôu‚Äôll√°h]]‚Äôs [[tablet of the Branch]] in which he constantly exalts his son's virtues and station.&lt;ref name=&quot;totb&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Tablet of the Branch | url = http://bahai-library.com/bahaullah_surih_ghusn | publisher = Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust| accessdate=2008-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family were soon exiled to [[Adrianople]] and `Abdu'l-Bah√° went with the family.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith 2000 14‚Äì20&quot;/&gt; `Abdu‚Äôl-Bah√° again suffered from frostbite.&lt;ref name=&quot;lotoae&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Phelps|1912|pp=27‚Äì55}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In Adrianople `Abdu‚Äôl-Bah√° was regarded as the sole comforter of his family ‚Äì in particular to his [[√Ås√≠yih Kh√°num|mother]].&lt;ref name=&quot;lotoae&quot; /&gt; At this point `Abdu'l-Bah√° was known by the Bah√°'√≠s as &quot;the Master&quot;, and by non-Bah√°'√≠s as `Abb√°s Effendi (&quot;Effendi&quot; signifies &quot;Sir&quot;). It was in Adrianople that Bah√°‚Äôu‚Äôll√°h referred to his son as &quot;the Mystery of God&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;lotoae&quot; /&gt; The title of &quot;Mystery of God&quot; symbolises, according to Bah√°'√≠s, that `Abdu'l-Bah√° is not a [[manifestation of God]] but how a &quot;person of `Abdu'l-Bah√° the incompatible characteristics of a human nature and superhuman knowledge and perfection have been blended and are completely harmonized&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;tcob&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = The Covenant of Bah√°'u'll√°h | url = http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/WOB/wob-39.html.utf8?query=completely|harmonized&amp;action=highlight#gr8 | publisher = US Bah√°‚Äô√≠ Publishing Trust | accessdate=2008-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bwo&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = The World Order of Bah√°‚Äôu‚Äôll√°h | url = http://bahai-library.com/abdulbaha_kuntu_kanzan_makhfiyyan | publisher = Baha'i Studies Bulletin 3:4 (Dec. 1985), 4-35| accessdate=2009-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; `Abdu'l-Bah√° was at this point noted for having black hair which flowed to his shoulders, large blue eyes, alabaster coloured skin and a slight Roman nose.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gail|1987|p=281}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bah√°'u'll√°h gave his son many other titles such as &quot;the Most Mighty Branch&quot; the &quot;Branch of Holiness&quot;, &quot;the Center of the Covenant&quot; and the apple of his eye.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith 2000 14‚Äì20&quot;/&gt; `Abdu'l-Bah√° (&quot;the Master&quot;) was devastated when hearing the news that him and his family were to be exiled separately from [[Bah√°'u'll√°h]]. It was, according to Bah√°'√≠s, through his intercession that the idea was reverted and the family were allowed to be exiled together.&lt;ref name=&quot;lotoae&quot; /&gt;

== Acre ==
[[File:AkkaPrison.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Prison in Acre]]
At the age of 24, `Abdu'l-Bah√° was clearly chief-steward to his father and an outstanding member of the Bah√°‚Äô√≠ community.&lt;ref name=&quot;b_p17&quot;/&gt; Bah√°‚Äôu‚Äôll√°h and his family were ‚Äì in 1868 ‚Äì exiled to the penal colony of [[Acre, Palestine]] where it was expected that the family would perish.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Foltz|2004|pp=151}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arrival in Acre was distressing for the family and exiles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith 2000 14‚Äì20&quot;/&gt; They were greeted in a hostile manner by the surrounding population and his sister and father fell dangerously ill.&lt;ref name=&quot;bne&quot; /&gt; When told that the women were to sit on the shoulders of the men to reach the shore, `Abdu'l-Bah√° took a chair and carried the women to the bay of Acre.&lt;ref name=&quot;lotoae&quot; /&gt; `Abdu'l-Bah√° was able to procure some anesthetic and nursed the sick.&lt;ref name=&quot;lotoae&quot; /&gt; The Bah√°‚Äô√≠s were imprisoned under horrendous conditions in a cluster of cells covered in excrement and dirt.&lt;ref name=&quot;bne&quot; /&gt; `Abdu'l-Bah√° himself fell dangerously ill with [[dysentery]],&lt;ref name=&quot;bne&quot; /&gt; however a sympathetic soldier premitted a physician to help cure him.&lt;ref name=&quot;lotoae&quot; /&gt; The population shunned them, the soldiers treated them the same, and the behaviour of Siyyid Muhammad-i-Isfahani (an [[Azali]]) did not help matters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harvnb|Kazemzadeh|2009&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;b_p17&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Balyuzi|2001|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morale was further destroyed with the death of `Abdu'l-Bah√°‚Äôs youngest brother [[M√≠rz√° Mihd√≠]] at the age of 22.&lt;ref name=&quot;lotoae&quot; /&gt; His death devastated the family ‚Äì particularly his [[√Ås√≠yih Kh√°num|mother]] and father ‚Äì and the grieving `Abdu'l-Bah√° kept a night-long vigil beside his brother‚Äôs body.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harvnb|Kazemzadeh|2009&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;lotoae&quot; /&gt;

=== Later in Acre ===
Over time, he gradually took over responsibility for the relationships between the small [[Bah√°'√≠ Faith|Bah√°'i]] exile community and the outside world. It was through his interaction with the people of Acre that, according to the Bah√°'√≠s, they recognized the innocence of the Bah√°'√≠s, and thus the conditions of imprisonment were eased.&lt;ref name=&quot;b_p33&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Balyuzi|2001|pp=33‚Äì43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four months after the death of Mihd√≠ the family moved from the prison to the [[House of `Abb√∫d]].&lt;ref name=&quot;b_p33&quot; /&gt; The people of Acre started to respect the Bah√°'√≠s and in particular, `Abdu'l-Bah√°. `Abdu'l-Bah√° was able to arrange for [[House_of_%60Abb√∫d#Akk.C3.A1_area|houses to be rented]] for the family, the family later moved to the [[Mansion of Bahj√≠]] around 1879 when an epidemic caused the inhabitants to flee. 

`Abdu'l-Bah√° soon became very popular in the penal colony and Myron Phelps a wealthy New York lawyer described how &quot;a crowd of human beings...Syrians, Arabs, Ethiopians, and many others&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phelps|1912|pp=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; all waited to talk and receive `Abdu'l-Bah√°.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|2000|pp=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; He undertook a history of the B√°b√≠ religion through publication of [[A Traveller's Narrative]] (Mak√°la-i-Shakhs√≠ Sayy√°h) in 1886,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.h-net.org/~bahai/diglib/books/A-E/B/browne/tn/tnfrnt.htm A Traveller's Narrative, (Mak√°la-i-Shakhs√≠ Sayy√°h)]&lt;/ref&gt; later translated and published in translation in 1891 through Cambridge University by the agency of [[Edward Granville Browne]] who described `Abdu'l-Bah√° as: {{quote|Seldom have I seen one whose appearance impressed me more.

=== Marriage and family life===
[[File:Abbaseffendi1868.jpg|right|thumb|190px|`Abdu'l-Bah√° as a young man aged 24]]
As a young man speculation was rife amongst the Bah√°‚Äô√≠s to whom `Abdu'l-Bah√° would marry.&lt;ref name=&quot;bne&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hogenson, p.87&lt;/ref&gt; Several young girls were seen as marriage prospects but `Abdu‚Äôl-Bah√° seemed disinclined to marriage.&lt;ref name=&quot;bne&quot; /&gt; On March 8, 1873, at the urging of his father,&lt;ref name=&quot;Harvnb|Kazemzadeh|2009&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ma'ani|2008|p=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; the twenty-eight-year-old `Abdu‚Äôl-Bah√° married [[Mun√≠rih Kh√°num|F√°timih Nahr√≠ of Isfah√°n]] (1847‚Äì1938) a twenty-five-year-old noblewoman.&lt;ref name=Smith2000-p255&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|2000|p=255}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her father was M√≠rz√° Mu·∏•ammad `Al√≠ Nahr√≠ of [[Isfahan]] an eminent Bah√°‚Äô√≠ of the city and prominent aristocrat.&lt;ref name=&quot;bne&quot; /&gt; F√°timih was brought from [[Persia]] to [[Acre, Israel]] after both [[Bah√°‚Äôu‚Äôll√°h]] and his wife [[Navv√°b]] expressed an interest in her to marry `Abdu‚Äôl-Bah√°.&lt;ref name=&quot;bne&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=Smith2000-p255/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ltoae&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Phelps|1912|pp=85‚Äì94}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a wearisome journey from Isfah√°n to Akka she finally arrived accompanied by her brother in 1872.&lt;ref name=&quot;bne&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ltoae&quot;/&gt; The young couple were betrothed for about five months before the marriage itself commenced. In the mean time, F√°timih lived in the home of `Abdu'l-Bah√°‚Äôs uncle [[M√≠rz√° M√∫s√°]]. According to her later memoirs, F√°timih fell in love with `Abdu'l-Bah√° on seeing him. `Abdu'l-Bah√° himself had showed little inkling to marriage until meeting F√°timih;&lt;ref name=&quot;ltoae&quot;/&gt; who was entitled Mun√≠rih by [[Bah√°‚Äôu‚Äôll√°h]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Harvnb|Kazemzadeh|2009&quot;/&gt; Mun√≠rih is a title meaning &quot;Luminous&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;aittbf&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|2008|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The marriage resulted in nine children. The first born was a son Mihd√≠ Effendi who died aged about 3. He was followed by ·∏åiy√°'iyyih &lt;u&gt;Kh&lt;/u&gt;√°num, Fu‚Äô√°d√≠yyih &lt;u&gt;Kh&lt;/u&gt;√°num (d. few years old), R√∫hang√≠z Kh√°num (d. 1893), T√∫b√° Kh√°num, Husayn Effendi (d.1887 aged 5), T√∫b√° &lt;u&gt;Kh&lt;/u&gt;√°num, R√∫h√° &lt;u&gt;Kh&lt;/u&gt;√°num and Munnavar &lt;u&gt;Kh&lt;/u&gt;√°num. The death of his children caused `Abdu‚Äôl-Bah√° immense grief ‚Äì in particular the death of his son Husayn Effendi came at a difficult time following the death of his mother and uncle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ma'ani|2008|p=323}}&lt;/ref&gt; The surviving children (all daughters) were; ·∏åiy√°'iyyih &lt;u&gt;Kh&lt;/u&gt;√°num (mother of [[Shoghi Effendi]]) (d. 1951) T√∫b√° &lt;u&gt;Kh&lt;/u&gt;√°num (1880‚Äì1959) R√∫·∏•√° &lt;u&gt;Kh&lt;/u&gt;√°num and Munavvar &lt;u&gt;Kh&lt;/u&gt;√°num (d. 1971).&lt;ref name=&quot;bne&quot; /&gt; [[Bah√°'u'll√°h]] wished that the Bah√°'√≠s follow the example of `Abdu'l-Bah√° and gradually move away from polygamy.&lt;ref name=&quot;ltoae&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;aittbf&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ma'ani|2008|p=360}}&lt;/ref&gt; The marriage of `Abdu‚Äôl-Bah√° to one woman and his choice to remain monogamous,&lt;ref name=&quot;ltoae&quot;/&gt; from advice of his father and his own wish,&lt;ref name=&quot;ltoae&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;aittbf&quot;/&gt; legitimised the practice of monogamy&lt;ref name=&quot;aittbf&quot;/&gt; to a people whom hitherto had regarded polygamy as a righteous way of life.&lt;ref name=&quot;ltoae&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;aittbf&quot;/&gt;

==Early years of his ministry==
[[Image:Baha (Lafayette).jpg|thumb|left|150px|`Abdu&amp;#39;l-Bah√°]]
After Bah√°'u'll√°h died on 29 May 1892, the [[Tablets of Bah√°'u'll√°h#Kit√°b-i-`Ahd (Book of the Covenant)|Will and Testament]] of Bah√°'u'll√°h named `Abdu'l-Bah√° as Centre of the Covenant, successor and interpreter of Bah√°'u'll√°h's writings.&lt;ref name=&quot;iranica_abdulbaha_b&quot; /&gt; In the Will and Testament `Abdu'l-Bah√°'s half-brother, [[M√≠rz√° Muhammad `Al√≠|Muhammad `Al√≠]], was mentioned by name as being subordinate to `Abdu'l-Bah√°. Muhammad `Al√≠ became jealous of his half-brother and set out to establish authority for himself as an alternative leader with the support of his brothers Badi'u'llah and Diya'u'llah.&lt;ref name=&quot;Qazvini&quot; /&gt; He began correspondence with Bah√°'√≠s in Iran, initially in secret, casting doubts in others' minds about `Abdu'l-Bah√°.&lt;ref name=&quot;b_p53&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Balyuzi|2001|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; While most Bah√°'√≠s followed `Abdu'l-Bah√°, a handful followed Muhammad `Al√≠ including such leaders as Mirza Javad and Ibrahim Khayru'llah, the famous Bah√°'√≠ missionary to America.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Browne|1918|p=145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Muhammad `Al√≠ and Mirza Javad began to openly accuse `Abdu'l-Bah√° of taking on too much authority, suggesting that he believed himself to be a [[Manifestation of God]], equal in status to Bah√°'u'll√°h.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Browne|1918|p=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was at this time that `Abdu'l-Bah√°, in order to provide proof of the falsity of the accusations leveled against him, in tablets to the West, stated that he was to be known as &quot;`Abdu'l-Bah√°&quot; an [[Arabic language|Arabic]] phrase meaning the Servant of Bah√° to make it clear that he was not a Manifestation of God, and that his station was only servitude.&lt;ref name=&quot;b_p60&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Balyuzi|2001|p=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/ab/TAB/tab-473.html.utf8?query=my|name|abdul&amp;action=highlight#gr5| title = Tablets of Abdul-Baha Abbas | author = Abdul-Baha | date =  | accessdate =}}&lt;/ref&gt; `Abdu'l-Bah√° left a [[Will and Testament of `Abdu'l-Bah√°|Will and Testament]] that set up the framework of administration. The two highest institutions were the Universal House of Justice, and the Guardianship, for which he appointed [[Shoghi Effendi]] as the Guardian.&lt;ref name=&quot;iranica_abdulbaha_b&quot; /&gt;
=== First Western pilgrims ===

By the end of 1898, Western pilgrims started coming to Akka on pilgrimage to visit `Abdu'l-Bah√°; this group of pilgrims, including [[Phoebe Hearst]], was the first time that Bah√°'√≠s raised up in the West had met `Abdu'l-Bah√°.&lt;ref name=&quot;b_p69&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Balyuzi|2001|p=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first group arrived in 1898 and throughout late 1898 to early 1899 Western Bah√°‚Äô√≠s sporadically visited `Abdu'l-Bah√°. The group was relatively young containing mainly women from high American society in their 20s.&lt;ref&gt;Hogenson, p.x&lt;/ref&gt; The group of Westerners aroused suspicion for the authorities, and consequently `Abdu'l-Bah√°‚Äôs confinement was tightened.&lt;ref&gt;Hogenson, p.308&lt;/ref&gt; During the next decade `Abdu'l-Bah√° would be in constant communication with Bah√°'√≠s around the world, helping them to teach the religion; the group included [[May Maxwell|May Ellis Bolles]] in Paris, Englishman Thomas Breakwell, American Herbert Hopper,  French Hippolyte Dreyfus, Susan Moody, Lua Getsinger, and American Laura Clifford Barney.&lt;ref name=&quot;b_p72&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Balyuzi|2001|pp=72‚Äì96}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was Laura Clifford Barney who, by asking questions of `Abdu'l-Bah√° over many years and many visits to Haifa, compiled what later became the book [[Some Answered Questions]].&lt;ref name=&quot;b_p82&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Balyuzi|2001|p=82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ministry, 1901-1912  === 

During the final years of the 19th century, while `Abdu'l-Bah√° was still officially a prisoner and confined to `Akka, he organized the transfer of the remains of the [[B√°b]] from Iran to Palestine.  He then organized the purchase of land on [[Mount Carmel]] that Bah√°'u'll√°h had instructed should be used to lay the remains of the B√°b, and organized for the construction of the [[Shrine of the B√°b]]. This process took another 10 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;b_p90-93&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Balyuzi|2001|pp=90‚Äì93}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the increase of pilgrims visiting `Abdu'l-Bah√°, Muhammad `Al√≠ worked with the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman authorities]] to re-introduce stricter terms on `Abdu'l-Bah√°'s imprisonment in August 1901.&lt;ref name=&quot;iranica_abdulbaha_b&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;b_p94&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Balyuzi|2001|pp=94‚Äì95}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1902, however, due to the Governor of `Akka being supportive of `Abdu'l-Bah√°, the situation was greatly eased; while pilgrims were able to once again visit `Abdu'l-Bah√°, he was confined to the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;b_p94&quot; /&gt; In February 1903, two followers of Muhammad `Al√≠, including Badi'u'llah and Siyyid `Aliy-i-Afnan, broke with Muhammad `Ali and wrote books and letters giving details of Muhammad `Ali's plots and noting that what was circulating about `Abdu'l-Bah√° was fabrication.&lt;ref name=&quot;b_p102&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Balyuzi|2001|p=102}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Afroukhteh|2003|p=166}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1902 to 1904, in addition to the building of the [[Shrine of the B√°b]] that `Abdu'l-Bah√° was directing, he started to put into execution two different projects; the restoration of the [[House of the B√°b]] in [[Shiraz, Iran]] and the construction of the first [[Bah√°'√≠ House of Worship]] in [[Ashgabat]], Turkmenistan.&lt;ref name=&quot;b_p107&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Balyuzi|2001|p=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;  `Abdu'l-Bah√° asked Aqa Mirza Aqa to coordinate the work so that the house of the B√°b would be restored to the state that it was at the time of the B√°b's declaration to [[Mulla Husayn]] in 1844;&lt;ref name=&quot;b_p107&quot; /&gt;  he also entrusted the work on the House of Worship to [[Vakil-u'd-Dawlih]].&lt;ref name=&quot;b_p109&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Balyuzi|2001|p=109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1904, Muhammad `Ali continued his accusations against `Abdu'l-Bah√° which caused an Ottoman commission summoning `Abdu'l-Bah√° to answer the accusations levelled against him. During the inquiry the charges against him were dropped and the inquiry collapsed.&lt;ref name=&quot;b_p111&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Balyuzi|2001|pp=111‚Äì113}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Momen|1981|pp=320‚Äì323}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next few years in `Akka were relatively free of pressures and pilgrims were able to come and visit `Abdu'l-Bah√°.  By 1909 the mausoleum of the Shrine of the B√°b was completed.&lt;ref name=&quot;b_p109&quot;/&gt;

[[Image:Abdulbaha2.jpg|thumb|`Abdu'l-Bah√°, during his trip to the United States]]

{{main|`Abdu'l-Bah√°'s journeys to the West}}

The 1908 [[Young Turks]] revolution freed all political prisoners in the Ottoman Empire, and `Abdu'l-Bah√° was freed from imprisonment. His first action after his freedom was to visit the [[Shrine of Bah√°'u'll√°h]] in [[Bahji]].&lt;ref name=&quot;b_p131&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Balyuzi|2001|p=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; While `Abdu'l-Bah√° continued to live in `Akka immediately following the revolution, he soon moved [[House of `Abdu'l-Bah√°|to live]] in [[Haifa]] near the Shrine of the B√°b.&lt;ref name=&quot;b_p131&quot; /&gt; In 1910, with the freedom to leave the country, he embarked on a three year journey to [[Egypt]], [[Europe]], and [[North America]], spreading the Bah√°'√≠ message.&lt;ref name=&quot;iranica_abdulbaha_b&quot; /&gt;

From August to December 1911, `Abdu'l-Bah√° visited cities in Europe, including [[London]], [[Bristol]], and [[Paris]]. The purpose of these trips was to support the Bah√°'√≠ communities in the west and to further spread his father's teachings.&lt;ref name=&quot;b_end&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Balyuzi|2001|pp=159‚Äì397}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following year, he undertook a much more extensive journey to the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] to once again spread his father's teachings.  He arrived in [[New York City]] on 11 April 1912, after declining an offer of passage on the [[RMS Titanic]], telling the Bah√°'√≠ believers, instead, to &quot;Donate this to charity.&quot; He instead travelled on a slower craft, the S.S. Cedric, and cited preference of a longer sea journey as the reason.&lt;ref name=&quot;b_p171&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Balyuzi|2001|p=171}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon arriving in New York, he arranged a private meeting with the survivors of the ill-fated [[RMS Titanic|Titanic]], who asked him if he knew the Titanic's ultimate destruction would occur, to which, 'Abdu'l-Baha replied, &quot;God gives man feelings of intuition&quot;. While he spent most of his time in New York, he visited [[Chicago]], [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]], [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]], [[Washington, D.C.]], [[Boston]] and [[Philadelphia]]. In August of the same year he started a more extensive journey to places including [[New Hampshire]], the [[Green Acre]] school in [[Maine]], and [[Montreal]] (his only visit to Canada). He then travelled west to [[Minneapolis, Minnesota|Minneapolis]], [[San Francisco]], [[Stanford University|Stanford]], and [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] before starting to return east at the end of October. On 5 December 1912 he set sail back to Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;b_end&quot; /&gt;

During his visit to North America he visited many missions, churches, and groups, as well as having scores of meetings in Bah√°'√≠s' homes, and offering innumerable personal meetings with hundreds of people.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallagher196&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Gallagher|Ashcraft|2006|p=196}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his talks he proclaimed Bah√°'√≠ principles such as the [[God in the Bah√°'√≠ Faith|unity of God]], [[Bah√°'√≠ Faith and the unity of religion|unity of the religions]], [[Bah√°'√≠ Faith and the unity of humanity|oneness of humanity]], [[Bah√°'√≠ Faith and gender equality|equality of women and men]], world peace and economic justice.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallagher196&quot;/&gt; He also insisted that all his meetings be open to all races.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallagher196&quot;/&gt;  

His visit and talks were the subject of hundreds of newspaper articles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallagher196&quot;/&gt; In Boston newspaper reporters asked `Abdu'l-Bah√° why he had come to America, and he stated that he had come to participate in conferences on peace and that just giving warning messages is not enough.&lt;ref name=&quot;b_p232&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Balyuzi|2001|p=232}}&lt;/ref&gt; `Abdu'l-Bah√°'s visit to Montreal provided notable newspaper coverage; on the night of his arrival the editor of the ''Montreal Daily Star'' met with him and that newspaper along with [[The Montreal Gazette]], ''Montreal Standard'', [[Le Devoir]] and [[La Presse (Canada)|La Presse]] among others reported on `Abdu'l-Bah√°'s activities.&lt;ref name=&quot;vanderHoonaard56&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Van den Hoonaard|1996|pp=56‚Äì58}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;b_p256&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Balyuzi|2001|p=256}}&lt;/ref&gt; The headlines in those papers included &quot;Persian Teacher to Preach Peace&quot;, &quot;Racialism Wrong, Says Eastern Sage, Strife and War Caused by Religious and National Prejudices&quot;,  and &quot;Apostle of Peace Meets Socialists, Abdul Baha's Novel Scheme for Distribution of Surplus Wealth.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;b_p256&quot;/&gt;  The ''Montreal Standard'', which was distributed across Canada, took so much interest that it republished the articles a week later; the Gazette published six articles and Montreal's largest [[French language]] newspaper published two articles about him.&lt;ref name=&quot;vanderHoonaard56&quot;/&gt; His 1912 visit to Montreal also inspired humourist [[Stephen Leacock]] to parody him in his bestselling 1914 book ''[[Arcadian Adventures with the Idle Rich]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Wagner, Ralph D. [http://bahai-library.com/leacock_yahi_bahi_society Yahi-Bahi Society of Mrs. Resselyer-Brown, The]. Accessed on: 19-05-2008&lt;/ref&gt; In Chicago one newspaper headline included &quot;His Holiness Visits Us, Not Pius X but A. Baha,&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;b_p256&quot;/&gt; and `Abdu'l-Bah√°'s visit to California was reported in the ''Palo Altan''.&lt;ref name=&quot;b_p313&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Balyuzi|2001|p=313}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Back in Europe, he visited [[London]], [[Paris]] (where he stayed for two months), [[Stuttgart]], [[Budapest]], and [[Vienna]]. Finally on 12 June 1913 he returned to [[Egypt]], where he stayed for six months before returning to [[Haifa]].&lt;ref name=&quot;b_end&quot; /&gt;

==Final years==
[[Image:AAbdul-baha late life.jpg|thumb|275px|`Abdu'l-Bah√° on Mount Carmel with pilgrims in 1919]]
During [[World War I]] `Abdu'l-Bah√° stayed in Palestine, under the continued threat of Allied bombardment and threats from the Turkish commander. As the war ended, the British Mandate over Palestine brought relative security to `Abdu'l-Bah√°. During his final year, a growing number of visitors and pilgrims came to see him in [[Haifa]].&lt;ref name=&quot;b_end2&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Balyuzi|2001|pp=400‚Äì431}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 April 1920, he was awarded a [[knighthood]] ([[Order of the British Empire|KBE]]) by the [[British Mandate of Palestine]] for his humanitarian efforts during the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;iranica_abdulbaha_b&quot; /&gt; `Abdu'l-Bah√° died on 28 November 1921 (27th of [[Rabi' al-awwal|Rabi'u'l-Avval]], 1340 AH.)&lt;ref name=&quot;Qazvini&quot; /&gt; On his funeral, Esslemont notes:
:&quot;... a funeral the like of which Haifa, nay Palestine itself, had surely never seen... so deep was the feeling that brought so many thousands of mourners together, representative of so many religions, races and tongues.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Esslemont|1980|p=77}}, quoting 'The Passing of `Abdu'l-Bah√°&quot;, by Lady Blomfield and Shoghi Effendi, pp 11, 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

He is buried in the front room of the [[Shrine of the B√°b]] on [[Mount Carmel]]. Plans are in place to one day build a [[Shrine of `Abdu'l-Bah√°]]. In his [[Will and Testament of `Abdu'l-Bah√°|Will and Testament]] he appointed his grandson [[Shoghi Effendi|Shoghi Effendi Rabbani]] as the Guardian of the Bah√°'√≠ Faith.&lt;ref name=&quot;iranica_abdulbaha_b&quot; /&gt;

==Works==
The total estimated number of [[Tablet (religious)|tablets]] that `Abdu'l-Bah√° wrote are over 27,000, of which only a fraction have been translated into English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://bahai-library.com/uhj_numbers_sacred_writings | title = Numbers and Classifications of Sacred Writings texts | author = Universal House of Justice | date = 2002-09 | accessdate = 2007-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His works fall into two groups including first his direct writings and second his lectures and speeches as noted by others.&lt;ref name=&quot;iranica_abdulbaha_b&quot;/&gt;  The first group includes ''[[The Secret of Divine Civilization]]'' written before 1875, ''A Traveller's Narrative'' written around 1886, the ResƒÅla-ye sƒ´ƒÅsƒ´ya or ''Sermon on the Art of Governance'' written in 1893, the ''Memorials of the Faithful'', and a large number of [[tablets (religious)|tablets]] written to various people;&lt;ref name=&quot;iranica_abdulbaha_b&quot;/&gt; including various Western intellectuals such as [[August Forel]] which has been translated and published as the [[Tablet to Dr. Forel|Tablet to Auguste-Henri Forel]]. The ''Secret of Divine Civilization'' and the ''Sermon on the Art of Governance'' were widely circulated anonymously.

The second group includes [[Some Answered Questions]], which is an English translation of a series of table talks with Laura Barney, and [[Paris Talks]], ''`Abdu'l-Baha in London'' and ''Promulgation of Universal Peace'' which are respectively addresses given by `Abdu'l-Bah√° in [[Paris]], [[London]] and the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=&quot;iranica_abdulbaha_b&quot;/&gt;

The following is a list of some of `Abdu'l-Bah√°'s many books, tablets, and talks:

'''Ambrose of Alexandria''' (before 212 ‚Äì c. 250) was a friend of the [[Christian]] [[theologian]] [[Origen]]. Ambrose was attracted by Origen's fame as a teacher, and visited the [[Catechetical School of Alexandria]] in 212.  At first a [[gnostic]] [[Valentinus (Gnostic)|Valentinian]] and [[Marcionism|Marcionist]], Ambrose, through Origen's teaching, eventually rejected this theology and became Origen's constant companion,&lt;ref&gt;[[Origen]], ''Epistle to Sextus Julius Africanus'' vol. i. p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; and was ordained [[deacon]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Jerome's De Viris Illustribus]] # 61.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Eusebius]], ''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Historia Ecclesiastica]]'' vii. 18&lt;/ref&gt; He plied Origen with questions, and urged him to write his Commentaries ({{polytonic|·ºêœÅŒ≥ŒøŒ¥ŒπœéŒ∫œÑŒ∑œÇ}}) on the books of the [[Bible]], and, as a wealthy nobleman and courtier,&lt;ref name=&quot;DGRBM&quot;/&gt; he provided his teacher with books for his studies and secretaries to lighten the labor of composition.&lt;ref&gt;S. Epiph. ''adv. Haer.'' 64. [44] ¬ß 3&lt;/ref&gt;

He suffered during the persecution under the Roman emperor [[Maximinus Thrax]] in 235.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eusebius of Caesarea]],  ''Church History'', 6.18.&lt;/ref&gt; He was later released and died a [[confessor]].&lt;ref name=&quot;patrick&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last =Rabenstein | first =Katherine | title =Ambrose of Alexandria (AC) | work =Saints O' the Day for March 17 | date =March 1998 | url =http://www.saintpatrickdc.org/ss/0317.htm | accessdate =2007-04-30 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070206151558/http://www.saintpatrickdc.org/ss/0317.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last mention of Ambrose in the historical record is in Origen's ''[[Contra Celsum]],'' which the latter wrote at the solicitation of Ambrose.

Origen often speaks of Ambrose in affectionately as a man of education with excellent literary and scholarly tastes. All of Origen's works written after 218 are dedicated to Ambrose, including his ''On Martyrdom'', ''Contra Celsum'', ''Commentary on St. John's Gospel'', and ''On Prayer''.&lt;ref name=&quot;DGRBM&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last = Christie | first = Albany James | authorlink = Albany James Christie | title = Ambrosius Alexandrinus | editor = [[William Smith (lexicographer)|William Smith]] | encyclopedia = [[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]] | volume = 1 | pages = 139 | publisher = [[Little, Brown and Company]] | location = Boston | year = 1867 | url = http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/0148.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ambrose's letters to Origen (praised by [[Jerome]]) are lost, although part of one exists.&lt;ref&gt;Routh, ''Reliquiae Sacr.'' ii. p. 367&lt;/ref&gt;

==Veneration==
Ambrose is venerated as a saint by some branches of Christianity. His feast day in the [[Roman Catholic Church]] falls on 17 March.&lt;ref name=&quot;patrick&quot;/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">An '''autonomous building''' is a building designed to be operated independently from [[infrastructure|infrastructural]] support services such as the [[electric power]] grid, [[gas grid]], municipal water systems, [[sewage treatment]] systems, [[storm drain]]s, communication services, and in some cases, public roads.

Advocates of autonomous building describe advantages that include reduced environmental impacts, increased security, and lower costs of ownership. Some cited advantages satisfy tenets of [[green building]], not independence per se (see below). [[Off-the-grid|Off-grid]] buildings often rely very little on civil services and are therefore safer and more comfortable during civil disaster or military attacks. (Off-grid buildings would not lose power or water if public supplies were compromised for some reason.)

Most of the research and published articles concerning autonomous building focus on residential homes.

British architects [[Brenda and Robert Vale]] have said that, as of 2002, &quot;It is quite possible in all parts of Australia to construct a 'house with no bills', which would be comfortable without heating and cooling, which would make its own electricity, collect its own water and deal with its own waste...These houses can be built now, using off-the-shelf techniques. It is possible to build a &quot;house with no bills&quot; for the same price as a conventional house, but it would be (25%) smaller.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Vale |first= Brenda and Robert |authorlink= Brenda and Robert Vale |title= The New Autonomous House|year= 2000|publisher= Thames &amp; Hudson Ltd|location= London |isbn=0-500-34176-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Image:Dymaxion house.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Dymaxion House]], reconstructed and installed in the [[Henry Ford Museum]].]]
In the 1930s through the 1950s, [[Buckminster Fuller]]'s three prototype [[Dymaxion house]]s adopted many techniques to reduce resource use, such as a &quot;fogger&quot; shower head to reduce water use, a packaging toilet, and a vacuum turbine for electric power. While not designed as autonomous per se, Fuller's concern with sustainable and efficient design is congruent with the goal of autonomy, and showed that it was theoretically possible. One of the three prototype Dymaxion houses that Fuller produced was made part of the conventional Graham family residence in [[Wichita, Kansas|Wichita]], [[Kansas]], and has now been reconstructed at the [[The Henry Ford|Henry Ford Museum]].

In the 1970s, a group of activists and engineers calling themselves the [[New Alchemists]] believed the warnings of imminent resource depletion and starvation. The New Alchemists were famous for the depth of research effort placed in their projects. Using conventional [[construction]] techniques, they designed a series of &quot;[[bioshelter]]&quot; projects, the most famous of which was the [[Ark Bioshelter]] community for [[Prince Edward Island]]. They published the plans for all of these, with detailed design calculations and blueprints. The Ark used wind based water pumping and electricity, and was self-contained in food production. It had living quarters for people, [[fish farming|fish]] tanks raising [[Tilapia]] for [[protein]], a [[greenhouse]] watered with fish water and a closed loop sewage reclamation system that recycled human waste into sanitized fertilizer for the fish tanks. As of 2010-01-10, the successor organization to the New Alchemists has a web page up as the &quot;New Alchemy Institute&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vsb.cape.com/~nature/greencenter/newalchemy.html &quot;New Alchemy Institute&quot;] (Website). ''The Green Center''. Retrieved on 2010-01-10.&lt;/ref&gt; The PEI Ark has been abandoned and partially renovated several times.

Very often a practical autonomous building might include a garden for food.  In the 1970s and 1980s, [[Bill Mollison]] and [[David Holmgren]] developed [[permaculture]], a form of agriculture using perennial food plants organized in a comprehensive forest ecology. 

[[Image:PHOENIXBATH.jpg|left|thumb|The bathroom of an Earthship, featuring a recycled [[bottle wall]]]]

The 1990s saw the development of [[Earthship]]s, similar in intent to the Ark project, but organized as a for-profit venture, with construction details published in a series of 3 books by [[Mike Reynolds (architect)|Mike Reynolds]]. The building material is [[tire]]s filled with [[soil|earth]]. This makes a wall that has large amounts of thermal mass (see [[earth sheltering]]). [[Berms]] are placed on exposed surfaces to further increase the house's temperature stability. The water system starts with rain water, processed for drinking, then washing, then plant watering, then toilet flushing, and finally [[blackwater (waste)|black water]] is recycled again for more plant watering. The [[cistern]]s are placed and used as thermal masses. Power, including electricity, heat and water heating, is from [[solar energy|solar power]].

1990s architects such as [[William McDonough]] and [[Ken Yeang]] applied environmentally responsible building design to large commercial buildings, such as office buildings, making them largely self-sufficient in energy production. One major bank building ([[ING Group|ING's]] [[Amsterdam]] headquarters) in the [[Netherlands]] was constructed to be autonomous and artistic as well.

==Advantages==

As an architect or engineer becomes more concerned with the disadvantages of transportation networks, and dependence on distant resources, their designs tend to include more autonomous elements. The historic path to autonomy was a concern for secure sources of heat, power, water and food. A nearly parallel path toward autonomy has been to start with a concern for environmental impacts, which cause disadvantages.

Autonomous buildings can increase security and reduce environmental impacts by using on-site resources (such as sunlight and rain) that would otherwise be wasted. Autonomy often dramatically reduces the costs and impacts of networks that serve the building, because autonomy short-circuits the multiplying inefficiencies of collecting and transporting resources. Other impacted resources, such as oil reserves and the retention of the local watershed, can often be cheaply conserved by thoughtful designs.

Autonomous buildings are usually [[efficient energy use|energy-efficient]] in operation, and therefore cost-efficient, for the obvious reason that smaller energy needs are easier to satisfy off-grid. But they may substitute energy production or other techniques to avoid diminishing returns in extreme conservation.

An autonomous structure is not always environmentally friendly. The goal of independence from support systems is associated with, but not identical to, other goals of environmentally responsible green building. However, autonomous buildings also usually include some degree of [[sustainability]] through the use of [[renewable energy]] and other renewable resources, producing no more [[greenhouse gas]]es than they consume, and other measures.

==Disadvantages==

First and fundamentally, independence is a matter of degree. Complete independence is very hard or impossible to attain. For example, eliminating dependence on the electrical grid is relatively simple but growing all necessary food is a more demanding and time-consuming proposition.

Living in an autonomous shelter can require one to make sacrifices in one's lifestyle choices, personal behavior, and social expectations. Even the most comfortable and technologically advanced autonomous houses may require some differences in behavior. Some people adjust easily. Others describe the experience as inconvenient, irritating, isolating, or even as an unwanted full-time job. A well-designed building can reduce this issue, but usually at the expense of reduced autonomy.

An autonomous house must be custom-built (or extensively retrofitted) to suit the climate and location. Passive solar techniques, alternative toilet and sewage systems, thermal massing designs, basement battery systems, efficient windowing, and the array of other design tactics require some degree of non-standard construction, added expense, ongoing experimentation and maintenance, and also have an effect on the psychology of the space.

[[Brenda and Robert Vale|The Vales]], among others, have shown that living off-grid can be a practical, logical lifestyle choice&amp;mdash;under certain conditions.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

==Systems==
This section includes some minimal descriptions of methods, to give some feel for such a building's practicality, provide indexes to further information, and give a sense of modern trends.

===Water===
[[File:Ceres rainwater tank 2 Pengo.jpg|thumb|right|A domestic rainwater harvesting system]]
[[Image:Unterirdische Zisterne.jpg|thumb|right|A concrete under-floor cistern being installed.]]

There are many methods of collecting and conserving water. Use reduction is cost-effective.

[[Greywater]] systems reuse drained wash water to flush [[toilet]]s or to water lawns and [[garden]]s. Greywater systems can halve the water use of most residential buildings; however, they require the purchase of a sump, greywater pressurization pump and secondary [[plumbing]]. Some builders are installing [[waterless urinal]]s and even [[composting toilet]]s that completely eliminate water usage in sewage disposal.

The classic solution with minimal life-style changes is using a [[water well|well]]. Once drilled, a well-foot requires substantial power. However, advanced well-foots can reduce power usage by twofold or more from older models. Well water can be contaminated in some areas. The [[sono arsenic filter]] eliminates unhealthy [[arsenic]] in well water.

However drilling a well is an uncertain activity, with aquifers depleted in some areas.  It can also be expensive.

In regions with sufficient rainfall, it is often more economical to design a building to use rain, with supplementary water deliveries in a drought. Rain water makes excellent soft washwater, but needs antibacterial treatment.  If used for drinking, mineral supplements or mineralization is necessary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/dwq/nutconsensus/en/ WHO | Nutrient minerals in drinking-water and the potential health consequences of consumption of demineralized and remineralized and altered mineral content drinking-water: Consensus of the meeting&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Most [[desert]] and [[temperate]] climates get at least {{convert|250|mm|in}} of [[rain]] per year. This means that a typical one-story [[house]] with a greywater system can supply its year-round water needs from its roof alone. In the driest areas, it might require a [[cistern]] of {{convert|30|m3|USgal}}. Many areas average {{convert|13|mm|in}} of rain per week, and these can use a cistern as small as {{convert|10|m3|USgal}}.

In many areas, it is difficult to keep a roof clean enough for drinking.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uaf.edu/ces/publications/freepubs/HCM-01557.pdf Cistern Design, University of Alaska, referenced 2007-12-27 ]&lt;/ref&gt; To reduce dirt and bad tastes, systems use a metal collecting-roof and a &quot;roof cleaner&quot; tank that diverts the first 40 liters.  Cistern water is usually [[chlorination|chlorinated]], though [[reverse osmosis]] systems provide even better quality drinking water.

Modern cisterns are usually large plastic tanks.  Gravity tanks on short towers are reliable, so pump repairs are less urgent.  The least expensive bulk cistern is a fenced pond or pool at ground level.

Reducing autonomy reduces the size and expense of cisterns. Many autonomous homes can reduce water use below {{convert|10|USgal|L}} per person per day, so that in a [[drought]] a month of water can be delivered inexpensively via truck. Self-delivery is often possible by installing fabric water tanks that fit the bed of a pick-up truck.

It can be convenient to use the cistern as a heat sink or trap for a [[heat pump]] or [[HVAC|air conditioning]] system; however this can make cold drinking water warm, and in drier years may decrease the efficiency of the HVAC system.

[[Solar still]]s can efficiently produce drinking water from ditch water or cistern water, especially high-efficiency [[multiple effect humidification]] designs, which separate the evaporator(s) and condenser(s).

New technologies, like [[reverse osmosis]] can create unlimited amounts of pure water from polluted water, ocean water, and even from humid air. Water makers are available for yachts that convert seawater and electricity into [[drinking water|potable water]] and [[brine]]. [[Atmospheric water generator]]s extract moisture from dry desert air and filter it to pure water.

===Sewage===
====Resource====
[[Image:Remote compost toilet.jpg|thumb|right|A composting toilet]]
The approaches above treat human excrement as a waste rather than a resource. [[Humanure]] is composted human excrement, and can return nutrients to a garden. Recycling human excrement requires minimal life-style changes.

In the case of [[composting toilet]]s, units of varying size can be used to naturally decompose human [[feces]] into useful, odourless, safe compost. Without further research most health authorities forbid use of &quot;humanure&quot; for growing food directly in the compost (see ''Humanure'' by Joseph Jenkins). The risk is microbial and viral contamination.

State of the art home sewage treatment systems use biological treatment, usually beds of plants and aquaria, that absorb nutrients and bacteria and convert greywater and sewage to clear water. This odor- and color-free reclaimed water can be used to flush toilets and water outside plants. When tested, it approaches standards for potable water. In climates that freeze, the plants and aquaria need to be kept in a small greenhouse space. Good systems need about as much care as a large [[aquarium]].

Electric [[incinerating toilet]]s turn excrement into a small amount of ash. They are cool to the touch, have no water and no pipes, and require an air vent in a wall. They are used in remote areas where use of septic tanks is limited, usually to reduce nutrient loads in lakes.

[[NASA]]'s [[biochemical engineering|bioreactor]] is an extremely advanced biological sewage system. It can turn sewage into air and water through microbial action. NASA plans to use it in the manned [[Mars]] mission.

A big disadvantage of biological sewage treatment systems is that if the house is empty, the sewage system biota starve to death.

Another method is NASA's [[urine]]-to-water [[distill]]ation system.

====Waste====

Sewage handling is not attractive, but it is essential for public health. Many [[disease]]s are transmitted by poorly functioning sewage systems.

The standard system is a tiled leach field combined with a [[septic tank]]. The basic idea is to provide a small system with primary [[sewage treatment]]. Sludge settles to the bottom of the septic tank, is partially reduced by [[anaerobic digestion]], and fluid is dispersed in the leach field. The leach field is usually under a yard growing grass. Septic tanks can operate entirely by gravity, and if well managed, are reasonably safe.

Septic tanks have to be pumped periodically by a [[Cesspool emptier|honey wagon]] to eliminate non reducing solids. Failure to pump a septic tank can cause overflow that damages the leach field, and contaminates ground water. Septic tanks may also require some lifestyle changes, such as not using garbage disposals, minimizing fluids flushed into the tank, and minimizing nondigestible solids flushed into the tank. For example, septic safe toilet paper is recommended.

However, septic tanks remain popular because they permit standard plumbing fixtures, and require few or no lifestyle sacrifices.

Composting or [[packaging toilet]]s make it economical and sanitary to throw away sewage as part of the normal garbage collection service. They also reduce water use by half, and eliminate the difficulty and expense of septic tanks. However, they require the local landfill to use sanitary practices.

Incinerator systems are quite practical. The ashes are biologically safe, and less than 1/10 the volume of the original waste, but like all incinerator waste, are usually classified as hazardous waste.

Some of the oldest pre-system sewage types are [[pit toilet]]s, [[latrine]]s, and [[outhouse]]s. These are still used in many developing countries.

===Storm drains===

Drainage systems are a crucial compromise between human habitability and a secure, sustainable watershed. Paved areas and lawns or turf do not allow much precipitation to filter through the ground to recharge aquifers. They can cause flooding and damage in neighbourhoods, as the water flows over the surface towards a low point.

Typically, elaborate, capital-intensive [[storm sewer]] networks are engineered to deal with [[stormwater]]. In some cities, such as the [[Victorian era]] London sewers or much of the old City of [[Toronto]], the storm water system is combined with the sanitary sewer system. In the event of heavy precipitation, the load on the sewage treatment plant at the end of the pipe becomes too great to handle and raw sewage is dumped into holding tanks, and sometimes into surface water.

Autonomous buildings can address precipitation in a number of ways:

If a water absorbing [[swale (geographical feature)|swale]] for each yard is combined with permeable [[concrete]] streets, storm drains can be omitted from the neighbourhood. This can save more than $800 per house (1970s) by eliminating storm drains.&lt;ref&gt;Swales replacing drains: [[Paul Hawken]], [[Amory Lovins]] and [[Hunter Lovins]], &quot;Natural Capitalism,&quot; ch. 5, pp83.  The cited development is Village Homes, Davis, California, built in the 1970s by Michael and Judy Corbett&lt;/ref&gt; One way to use the savings is to purchase larger lots, which permits more amenities at the same cost. Permeable concrete is an established product in warm climates, and in development for freezing climates. In freezing climates, the elimination of storm drains can often still pay for enough land to construct swales (shallow water collecting ditches) or water impeding berms instead. This plan provides more land for homeowners and can offer more interesting topography for landscaping.

A [[green roof]] captures precipitation and uses the water to grow plants. It can be built into a new building or used to replace an existing roof.

===Electricity===
{{See|Microgeneration}}
{{See|Zero emissions}}

[[File:Green Building by Terry Farrel and Partners 394640345.jpg|thumb|right|Wind turbine on the roof]]
[[Image:Solar panels on house roof.jpg|thumb|right|A PV-solar system]]

Since electricity is an expensive utility, the first step towards conservation is to design a house and lifestyle to reduce demand. Fluorescent lights, laptop computers and gas-powered refrigerators save electricity, although gas-powered refrigerators are not very efficient.&lt;ref&gt;Sunfrost rates 15 cu. ft. refrigerators at [http://www.sunfrost.com/extreme_efficiency.html 0.27 kWh/day] (2007-12-27), while Dometic (formerly Servel) gas refrigerators cool only {{convert|8|cuft}} for [http://www.sunfrost.com/extreme_efficiency.html 325 W continuous] (i.e. 7.8 kWh/day) ALternatively, they use about {{convert|8|USgal}} of LP gas per month, which in most places is more expensive than the equivalent electricity.(2007-12-27)&lt;/ref&gt; There are also superefficient electric refrigerators, such as those produced by the [[Sun Frost]] company, some of which use only about half as much electricity as a mass-market [[energy star]]-rated refrigerator.

Using a solar roof, [[solar cell]]s can provide electric power. Solar roofs have the potential to be more cost-effective than retrofitted solar power, because buildings need roofs anyway. Modern solar cells last about 40 years, which makes them a reasonable investment in some areas. Solar cells have only small life-style impacts: The cells must be cleaned a few times per year.

A number of areas that lack [[sun]] have [[wind]]. To generate power, the average autonomous house needs only one small [[wind turbine|wind generator]], 5 metres or less in diameter. On a 30 metre high tower, this turbine can provide enough power to supplement solar power on cloudy days. Commercially available wind turbines use sealed, one-moving-part AC generators and passive, self-feathering blades for years of operation without service.

The largest advantage of [[wind power]] is that larger wind turbines have a lower per-watt cost than solar cells, provided there is wind. However, location is critical. Just as some locations lack sun for solar cells, some locations lack sufficient wind for an economical turbine installation. In the [[Great Plains]] of the [[United States]] a 10 metre turbine can supply enough energy to heat and cool a well-built all-electric house. Economic use in other areas requires research, and possibly a site-survey.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Gipe, &quot;Wind Power for Home and Business&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

During times of low demand, excess power can be stored in batteries for future use. However, batteries need to be replaced every few years. In many areas, battery expenses can be eliminated by attaching the building to the [[distributed generation|electric power grid]] and operating the power system with [[net metering]]. Utility permission is required, but such cooperative generation is legally mandated in some areas (for example, California).&lt;ref&gt;Gipe, ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;

A grid-based building is less autonomous, but more economical and sustainable with fewer lifestyle sacrifices. In rural areas the grid's cost and impacts can be reduced by using [[single wire earth return]] systems (for example, the [[MALT (electricity system)|MALT]]-system).

In areas that lack access to the grid, battery size can be reduced by including a generator to recharge the batteries during extended fogs or other low-power conditions. Auxiliary generators are usually run from [[propane]], [[natural gas]], or sometimes [[Diesel fuel|diesel]]. An hour of charging usually provides a day of operation. Modern residential chargers permit the user to set the charging times, so the generator is quiet at night. Some generators automatically test themselves once per week.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eaton.com Eaton power]; see the specifications and manuals.  Referenced 2007-12-27&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.KohlerSmartPower.com Kohler Generators]; see the specifications and manuals.  Referenced 2007-12-27&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent advances in [[magnetic levitation|passively stable magnetic bearings]] may someday permit inexpensive storage of power in a [[flywheel]] in a vacuum. Well-funded groups like Canada's [[Ballard Power Systems]] are also working to develop a &quot;[[regenerative fuel cell]]&quot;, a device that can generate hydrogen and oxygen when power is available, and combine these efficiently when power is needed.

[[Earth battery|Earth batteries]] tap electric currents in the earth called [[telluric current]]. They can be installed anywhere in the ground. They provide only low voltages and current. They were used to power [[Telegraphy|telegraphs]] in the 19th century. As appliance efficiencies increase, they may become practical.

[[Microbial fuel cell]]s finally allow the generation of electricity from biomass. Unlike direct incineration of biomass however, the method using a microbial fuel cell is completely emissionless. The plant can be chopped and converted as a whole, or it can be left alive so that waste saps from the plant can be converted by bacteria.

===Heating===
[[Image:Active Solar Water Heater Diagram.svg|thumb|right|150px|Schematic of an active solar heating system]]

Most autonomous buildings are designed to use insulation, thermal mass and passive solar heating and cooling. Examples of these are [[trombe wall]]s and other technologies as [[Steve Baer|skylights]].

[[passive solar building design|Passive solar heating]] can heat most buildings in even the coldest climates. In colder climates, extra construction costs can be as little as 15% more than new, conventional buildings. In warm climates, those having less than two weeks of frosty nights per year, there is no cost impact.

The basic requirement for passive solar heating is that the solar collectors must face the prevailing sunlight (south in the [[northern hemisphere]], north in the [[southern hemisphere]]), and the building must incorporate [[thermal mass]] to keep it warm in the night.

A recent, somewhat experimental [[solar heating]] system &quot;[[Annualized geo solar]] heating&quot; is practical even in regions that get little or no sunlight in winter.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, Don. September 2005. [http://www.greenershelter.com/TokyoPaper.pdf &quot;'Annualized Geo-Solar Heating' as a Sustainable Residential-scale Solution for Temperate Climates iwht Less than Ideal Daily Heating Season Solar Availability.&quot;] (&quot;Requested Paper for the Global Sustainable Building Conference 2005, Tokyo, Japan&quot;). Greenershelter.org website. Retrieved on 2007-09-16.&lt;/ref&gt;
It uses the ground beneath a building for thermal mass. Precipitation can carry away the heat, so the ground is shielded with {{nowrap|6 m}} skirts of plastic insulation. The thermal mass of this system is sufficiently inexpensive and large that it can store enough summer heat to warm a building for the whole winter, and enough winter cold to cool the building in summer.

In annualized geo solar systems, the solar collector is often separate from (and hotter or colder than) the living space. The building may actually be constructed from [[Thermal insulation|insulation]], for example, [[straw-bale construction]]. Some buildings have been aerodynamically designed so that convection via ducts and interior spaces eliminates any need for electric fans.

A more modest &quot;daily solar&quot; design is very practical.  For example, for about a 15% premium in building costs, the [[passive house|Passivhaus]] building codes in Europe use high performance insulating windows, R-30 insulation, HRV ventilation, and a small thermal mass. With modest changes in the building's position, modern [[krypton]]- or [[argon]]-insulated windows permit normal-looking windows to provide passive solar heat without compromising insulation or structural strength. If a small heater is available for the coldest nights, a slab or basement cistern can inexpensively provide the required [[thermal mass]]. Passivhaus building codes in particular bring unusually good interior air quality, because the buildings change the air several times per hour, passing it though a heat exchanger to keep heat inside.

In all systems, a small supplementary heater increases personal security and reduces lifestyle impacts for a small reduction of autonomy. The two most popular heaters for ultra-high-efficiency houses are a small [[heat pump]], which also provides [[air-conditioning]], or a central hydronic (radiator) air heater with water recirculating from the [[water heater]].  Passivhaus designs usually integrate the heater with the ventilation system.

[[Earth sheltering]] and [[windbreak]]s can also reduce the absolute amount of heat needed by a building. Several feet below the earth, temperature ranges from {{convert|4|C|F|abbr=on}} in North Dakota to {{convert|426|C|F|abbr=on}},&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ibid.&lt;/ref&gt; in Southern Florida. Wind breaks reduce the amount of heat carried away from a building.

Rounded, aerodynamic buildings also lose less heat.

An increasing number of commercial buildings use a [[combined cycle]] with [[cogeneration]] to provide heating, often water heating, from the output of a natural gas [[reciprocating engine]], [[gas turbine]] or [[stirling engine|stirling]] [[electric generator]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.microturbine.com/_docs/WCEMC04.pdf Capstone Microturbine White-Paper (PDF) Retrieved on 2007-12-28.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Houses designed to cope with interruptions in civil services generally incorporate a [[wood stove]], or heat and power from [[diesel fuel]] or [[bottled gas]], regardless of their other heating mechanisms.

Electric heaters and electric stoves may provide pollution-free heat (depending on the power source), but use large amounts of electricity. If enough electricity is provided by solar panels, wind turbines, or other means, then electric heaters and stoves become a practical autonomous design.

===Water heating===

{{See|Solar hot water}}

[[Solar water heater]]s are widely useful because they can save large amounts of fuel. Also, small changes in lifestyle, such as doing laundry, dishes and bathing on sunny days, can greatly increase their efficiency. To further increase the efficiency of water heating, either with or without solar, [[hot water heat recycling]] units recover heat from drainlines thereby increasing water heating capacity and reducing the energy used to heat water.

The basic trick in a solar water heating system is to use a well-insulated holding tank. Some systems are [[vacuum]]- insulated, acting something like large [[thermos]] bottles. The tank is filled with hot water on sunny days, and made available at all times. Unlike a conventional tank water heater, the tank is filled only when there is sunlight.

Good storage makes a smaller, higher-technology collector feasible. Such collectors can use relatively exotic technologies, such as vacuum insulation, and reflective concentration of sunlight.

Current practical, comfortable water-heating systems combine the solar heating system with a [[water heater#Tankless heaters|thermostatic gas-powered flow-through heater]], so that the temperature of the water is consistent, and the amount is unlimited. This again reduces life-style impacts at some cost in autonomy.  Ideally, this would be a [[cogeneration]] system that produces other energy, and uses locally produced fuels.

Heat recycling, cogenereration and solar pre-heating can save 50-75% of the gas otherwise used.  Also, some combinations provide redundant reliability by having several sources of heat.

Some authorities advocate that [[bottled gas]] or [[natural gas]] be replaced by [[biogas]]. However, this is usually impractical unless live-stock are on-site.  The wastes of a single family are usually insufficient to produce enough [[methane]] for anything more than small amounts of cooking.

===Cooling===

Annualized geo solar buildings often have buried, sloped water-tight skirts of insulation that extend {{convert|6|m|ft}} from the foundations, to prevent heat leakage between the earth used as thermal mass, and the surface.

Less dramatic improvements are possible. Windows can be shaded in summer. Eaves can be overhung to provide the necessary shade. These also shade the walls of the house, reducing cooling costs.

Another trick is to cool the building's thermal mass at night, and then cool the building from the thermal mass during the day. It helps to be able to route cold air from a sky-facing radiator (perhaps an air heating solar collector with an alternate purpose) or evaporative cooler directly through the thermal mass. On clear nights, even in tropical areas, sky facing radiators can cool below freezing.

If a circular building is aerodynamically smooth, and cooler than the ground, it can be passively cooled by the &quot;dome effect.&quot;  Many installations have reported that a reflective or light colored dome induces a local vertical heat driven vortex that sucks cooler overhead air downward into a dome if the dome is vented properly (a single overhead vent, and peripheral vents). Some people have reported a temperature differential as high as {{nowrap|8 ¬∞C}} ({{nowrap|15 ¬∞F}}) between the inside of the dome and the outside. [[Buckminster Fuller]] discovered this effect with a simple house design adapted from a [[grain silo]], and adapted his [[Dymaxion house]] and [[geodesic dome]]s to use it.

Refrigerators and air conditioners operating from the waste heat of a diesel engine exhaust, heater flue or solar collector are entering use. These use the same principles as a gas refrigerator. Normally, the heat from a flue powers an &quot;[[absorptive refrigeration|absorptive chiller]]&quot;. The cold water or brine from the chiller is used to cool air or a refrigerated space.

Cogeneration is popular in new commercial buildings. In current cogeneration systems small gas turbines or [[stirling engine]]s powered from natural gas produce electricity and their exhaust drives an [[absorptive chiller]].

A truck trailer refrigerator operating from the waste heat of a tractor's diesel exhaust was demonstrated by NRG Solutions, Inc. NRG developed a hydronic [[ammonia]] gas heat exchanger and vaporizer, the two essential new, not commercially available components of a waste heat driven refrigerator.

A similar scheme (multiphase cooling) can be by a multistage evaporative cooler. The air is passed through a spray of salt solution to dehumidify it, then through a spray of water solution to cool it, then another salt solution to dehumidify it again. The brine has to be regenerated, and that can be done economically with a low temperature solar still. Multiphase evaporative coolers can lower the air's temperature by {{nowrap|50 F}}, and still control humidity. If the brine regenerator uses high heat, they also partially sterilise the air.

If enough electric power is available, cooling can be provided by conventional air conditioning using a [[heat pump]].

===Food production===

Food production has often been included in historic autonomous projects to provide security.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nature.my.cape.com/greencenter/pubonline.html Publications list of the New Alchemy Institute]. Retrieved 2010-02-05.&lt;/ref&gt;
Skilled, intensive [[garden]]ing can support an adult from as little as 100 square meters of land per person,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pathtofreedom.com/urban-homestead#&quot;Urban Homestead at a Glance&quot; Path of Freedom]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;How to Grow a Complete Diet in Less Than 1000 Square Feet Dave Duhon &amp; Cindy Gebhard, 1984, 200 pp. Ecology Action GROW BIOINTENSIVE(R) Publications&lt;/ref&gt;
possibly requiring the use of organic farming and [[aeroponics]]. Some proven intensive, low-effort food-production systems include [[urban agriculture|urban gardening]] (indoors and outdoors). [[Grow house|Indoor cultivation]] may be set up using [[hydroponics]], while outdoor cultivation may be done using [[permaculture]], [[forest gardening]], [[no-till farming]], and [[do nothing farming]].

[[Greenhouse]]s are also sometimes included (see Earthship Biotincture). Sometimes they are also outfitted with irrigation systems or [[heat sink]]-systems which can respectively irrigate the plants or help to store energy from the sun and redistribute it at night (when the greenhouses starts to cool down).{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

===Communication===

An increasing number of activists provide free or very inexpensive [[World Wide Web|web]] and [[e-mail|email]] services using cooperative computer networks that run wireless [[mobile ad-hoc network|ad hoc network]]s. Network service is provided by a cooperative of neighbors, each operating a router as a household appliance. These minimize wired infrastructure, and its costs and vulnerabilities. Private [[Internet protocol]] networks set up in this way can operate without the use of a commercial provider.

Rural electrical grids can be wired with &quot;optical phase cable&quot;, in which one or more of the [[steel]] [[wikt:armor|armor]] wires are replaced with steel tubes containing [[fiber optics]].&lt;ref&gt;Northern Economics Inc. and Electric Power Systems Inc.

Alaska Department of Commerce, Community, and Economic Development, via dced.state.ak.us. Retrieved on 2007-09-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Satellite Internet access]] can provide high speed connectivity to remote locations, however these are significantly more expensive than wire-based or terrestrial wireless systems. [[Wimax]] and forms of [[packet radio]] can also be used. Depending on the speed and latency of these networks they may be capable of relaying [[VoIP]] traffic, negating the need for separate telephony services. Finally, the [[Internet Radio Linking Project]] provides potential for blending older (cheap) local radio broadcasting with the increased range of the internet.

Depending on the location a [[mobile phone]] network may be available which can provide voice and data services. [[Satellite phone|satellite]]-based telephone systems can also be used, as either fixed installations or portable handsets and can be integrated into a [[PABX]] or local IP-based network.

'''Anubis''' ({{lang-grc|·ºåŒΩŒøœÖŒ≤ŒπœÇ}}) is the [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]] name&lt;ref&gt;Charles Russell Coulter, Patricia Turner, ''Encyclopedia of ancient deities'',Sammy Northam Rocks 2000, ISBN 0786403179, p.58&lt;/ref&gt; for a [[jackal]]-headed [[deity|god]] associated with [[mummy|mummification]] and the [[Afterlife#Ancient Egypt|afterlife]] in [[ancient Egyptian religion]]. In the ancient Egyptian language, Anubis is known as '''Inpu''', (variously spelled '''Anup''', '''Anpu''', and '''Ienpw''').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.touregypt.net/godsofegypt/anubis.htm The Gods of Ancient Egypt - Anubis&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;. According to the Akkadian transcription in the Amarna letters, Anubis' name was vocalized as ''Anapa''&lt;ref&gt; The Tell Amarna Tablets [http://books.google.ca/books?id=OzIB5P77q8UC&amp;pg=PA85&amp;lpg=PA85&amp;dq=anubis++%22anapa%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=5nBsMefFwm&amp;sig=KZhSVYhr1i3OuilTPhobRHmLDZ8&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=PgPATZq0JcHVgQey_5SnBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=anubis%20%20%22anapa%22&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;. The oldest known mention of Anubis is in the [[Old Kingdom]] [[pyramid texts]], where he is associated with the burial of the [[Pharaoh]].&lt;ref name=Wilkinson&gt;{{cite book |author=Wilkinson, Richard H. |title=The complete gods and goddesses of ancient Egypt |publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson |location=London |year=2003 |pages=188‚Äì190 |isbn=0-500-05120-8 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this time, Anubis was the most important god of the Dead but he was replaced during the Middle Kingdom by [[Osiris]].&lt;ref&gt;Charles Freeman, The Legacy of Ancient Egypt, Facts on File, Inc. 1997. p.91&lt;/ref&gt; 

He takes names in connection with his funerary role, such as ''He who is upon his mountain'', which underscores his importance as a protector of the deceased and their tombs, and the title ''He who is in the place of embalming'', associating him with the process of mummification.&lt;ref name=Wilkinson /&gt; Like many ancient [[List of Egyptian gods|Egyptian deities]], Anubis assumes different roles in various contexts, and no public procession in [[Egypt]] would be conducted without an Anubis to march at the head.

Anubis' wife is a goddess called [[Anput]], his female aspect, and their daughter is the goddess [[Kebechet]].

==Portrayal==
Anubis was associated with the mummification and protection of the dead for their journey into the afterlife.
He was usually portrayed as a half human, half jackal, or in full jackal form wearing a ribbon and holding a [[flail]] in the crook of its arm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.egyptianmyths.net/anubis.htm Ancient Egypt: the Mythology - Anubis&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The jackal was strongly associated with cemeteries in ancient Egypt, since it was a scavenger which threatened to uncover human bodies and eat their flesh.&lt;ref name=&quot;Freeman, op. cit., p.91&quot;&gt;Freeman, op. cit., p.91&lt;/ref&gt; The distinctive black color of Anubis &quot;did not have to do with the jackal [per se] but with the color of rotting flesh and with the black soil of the Nile valley, symbolizing rebirth.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Freeman, op. cit., p.91&quot;/&gt;

Anubis is depicted in funerary contexts where he is shown attending to the [[mummies]] of the deceased or sitting atop a tomb protecting it. In fact, during embalming, the &quot;head embalmer&quot; wore an Anubis costume. The critical weighing of the heart scene in the ''[[Book of the Dead]]''  also shows Anubis performing the measurement that determined the worthiness of the deceased to enter the realm of the dead (the [[underworld]]). [[New Kingdom]] tomb-seals also depict Anubis sitting atop the [[nine bows]] that symbolize his domination over the foes of Egypt.&lt;ref name=Wilkinson /&gt;

==Embalmer==
One of the roles of Anubis was &quot;Guardian of the Scales&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Faulkner|first=Raymond O.|title=The Egyptian Book of the Dead: The Book of Going Forth by Day|year=Reprint edition (1 April 2008)|publisher=Chronicle Books|isbn=978-0811864893|pages=155|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=La9K8fp-BcMC&amp;pg=PA155&amp;dq=anubis+scales&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=nbo5TaP4A8WwhQeT5pSqCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=anubis%20scales&amp;f=false|coauthors=arol Andrews, James Wasserman}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Deciding the weight of &quot;truth&quot; by weighing the Heart against [[Ma'at]], who was often depicted as an ostrich feather, Anubis dictated the fate of souls. In this manner, he was a Lord of the Underworld, only usurped by Osiris.  

Anubis is a son of [[Ra]] in early myths, but later he became known as son of [[Osiris]] and [[Nephthys]], and in this role he helped Isis mummify his dead father.&lt;ref name=&quot;Freeman, op. cit., p.91&quot;/&gt; Indeed, when the [[Myth of Osiris and Isis]] emerged, it was said that when Osiris had been killed by Set, Osiris' organs were given to Anubis as a gift. With this connection, Anubis became the patron god of embalmers: during the funerary rites of [[mummy|mummification]], illustrations from the ''[[Book of the Dead]]'' often show a priest wearing the jackal mask supporting the upright mummy. Anubis' half-brother is [[Horus]] the Younger, son of Osiris and Isis.

==Perceptions outside Egypt==
In later times, during the [[Ptolemaic Egypt|Ptolemaic]] period, Anubis was merged with the [[Greek mythology|Greek]] god [[Hermes]], becoming [[Hermanubis]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.babylon.com/definition/Hermanubis/English Hermanubis | English | Dictionary &amp; Translation by Babylon&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The centre of this [[Cult (religious practice)|cult]] was in ''uten-ha''/''Sa-ka''/ [[Cynopolis]], a place whose Greek name simply means &quot;city of dogs&quot;. In Book XI of &quot;[[The Golden Ass]]&quot; by [[Apuleius]], we find evidence that the worship of this god was  maintained in [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] at least up to the 2nd century. Indeed, Hermanubis also appears in the [[alchemy|alchemical]] and [[Hermeticism|hermetical]] literature of the [[Middle Ages]] and the [[Renaissance]].

Although the Greeks and [[Ancient Romans|Romans]] typically scorned Egypt's animal-headed gods as bizarre and primitive (Anubis was known to be mockingly called &quot;Barker&quot; by the Greeks), Anubis was sometimes associated with [[Sirius]] in the heavens, and [[Cerberus]] in [[Hades]].  In his dialogues (e.g. ''Republic'' 399e, 592a), Plato has Socrates utter, &quot;by the dog&quot; (''kai me ton kuna''), &quot;by the dog of Egypt&quot;, &quot;by the dog, the god of the Egyptians&quot; (''Gorgias'', 482b), for emphasis. Anubis is also known as the god of mummification and death. Instead like other jackals Anubis' head was black to resemble the god of death.

==Birth==
Anubis was the son of Nephthys, and his father was Osiris. One myth says that Nephthys got Osiris drunk and the resultant seduction brought forth Anubis. Yet another says she disguised herself as Isis and seduced Osiris and subsequently gave birth to Anubis. Usually, Anubis is portrayed as the son of Nephthys and Set, Osiris' brother and the god of the desert and darkness. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.egyptianmyths.net/anubis.htm &lt;/ref&gt;

'''Arthur Robert Jensen''' (born August 24, 1923) is a Professor Emeritus of [[educational psychology]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.edb.utexas.edu/robinson/danr/JEBS%2031(3)%20-06_Jensen%20profile.pdf |title= |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2010-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Jensen is known for his work in [[psychometrics]] and [[differential psychology]], which is concerned with how and why individuals differ behaviorally from one another.

He is a major proponent of the [[hereditarianism|hereditarian]] position in the [[nature versus nurture]] debate, the position that concludes [[genetics]] play a significant role in behavioral traits, such as [[intelligence (trait)|intelligence]] and [[personality psychology|personality]]. He is the [[author]] of over 400 scientific papers published in refereed journals&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isteve.com/jensen.htm Sailer 1998]&lt;/ref&gt; and currently sits on the editorial boards of the [[scientific journals]] ''[[Intelligence (journal)|Intelligence]]'' and ''[[Personality and Individual Differences]].&lt;ref&gt;''Intelligence''[http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/journaleditorialboard.cws_home/620195/editorialboard] and ''Personality and Individual Differences''[http://authors.elsevier.com/JournalDetail.html?PubID=603&amp;Precis=EB] publisher's pages.&lt;/ref&gt;

While he has been rated as one of the top-50 eminent psychologists of the 20th Century,&lt;ref&gt;Jensen is listed in a study by Haggblom ''et al.'' (2002), [http://htpprints.yorku.ca/archive/00000064/] of the 100 most eminent psychologists of the twentieth century, at number 47.&lt;/ref&gt; Jensen remains a controversial figure, largely for his conclusions based on his and other research regarding the causes of [[race and intelligence|race-based differences in intelligence]].

==Biography==
Jensen was born August 24, 1923, to a father of Danish ancestry and a mother who was half [[History of the Jews in Poland|Polish Jewish]] and half German.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Intelligence, race, and genetics: conversations with Arthur R. Jensen |last1=Jensen |first1=Arthur Robert |last2=Miele |first2=Frank |edition=illustrated |year=2002 |publisher=Westview Press |isbn=9780813340081 |page=242 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He studied at [[University of California, Berkeley]] (B.A. 1945), [[San Diego State College]] (M.A., 1952) and [[Columbia University]] (Ph.D., 1956), and did his doctoral thesis on the [[Thematic Apperception Test]]. From 1956 through 1958, he did his postdoctoral research at the [[University of London]], Institute of Psychiatry.

Upon returning to the [[United States]], he became a researcher and professor at the [[University of California]], Berkeley, where he focused on individual differences in learning, especially the influences of [[culture]], development, and genetics on intelligence and learning. He received [[tenure]] at Berkeley in 1962 and was given his first [[sabbatical]] in 1964. He has concentrated much of his work on the learning difficulties of culturally disadvantaged students. In 2003, he was awarded the [[Kistler Prize]] for original contributions to the understanding of the connection between the human [[genome]] and human [[society]].

Jensen has had a lifelong interest in classical music and was, early in his life, attracted by the idea of becoming a [[Conducting|conductor]] himself. At 14, he conducted a [[Band (music)|band]] that won a nationwide [[competition|contest]] held in [[San Francisco]]. Later, he conducted orchestras and attended a [[seminar]] given by [[Nikolai Sokoloff]]. Soon after graduating from Berkeley, he moved to [[New York]], mainly to be near the conductor [[Arturo Toscanini]]. He was also deeply interested in the life and example of [[Gandhi]], producing an unpublished book-length manuscript on his life. During Jensen's period in [[San Diego]] he spent time working as a [[social worker]] with the San Diego Department of Public Welfare.

==IQ and academic achievement==
Jensen's interest in learning differences directed him to the extensive testing of black, Mexican-American, and other minority-group school children. The results led him to distinguish between two separate types of learning ability. ''Level I'', or associative learning, may be defined as retention of input and rote memorization of simple facts and skills. ''Level II'', or conceptual learning, is roughly equivalent to the ability to manipulate and transform inputs, that is, the ability to solve problems.  Statistical analysis of his findings led Jensen to conclude that Level I abilities were distributed equally among members of all races, but that Level II occurred with significantly greater frequency among whites and Asian-Americans than among African-Americans and Mexican-Americans.

Later, Jensen was an important advocate in the mainstream acceptance of [[general intelligence factor]], a concept which was essentially synonymous with his ''Level II'' conceptual learning. General intelligence factor, or ''g'', is an abstraction that stems from the [[observation]] that scores on all forms of cognitive tests correlate positively with one another.

Jensen claimed, on the basis of his research, that [[Heritability of IQ|general cognitive ability is essentially an inherited trait]], determined predominantly by genetic factors rather than by environmental conditions. He also contended that while associative learning, or memorizing ability, is equally distributed among the races, conceptual learning, or synthesizing ability, occurs with significantly greater frequency in Asians than in whites. He suggested that from the data one might conclude that, on average, Asian Americans are more intelligent than [[white Americans]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_g2699/is_0001/ai_2699000187 Encyclopedia of Psychology]&lt;/ref&gt;

Jensen's most controversial work, published in February 1969 in the ''[[Harvard Educational Review]]'', was titled &quot;How Much Can We Boost IQ and Scholastic Achievement?&quot; It concluded, among other things, that [[Head Start (education)|Head Start]] programs designed to boost [[African-American]] [[IQ]] scores had failed, and that this was likely never to be remedied, largely because, in Jensen's estimation, heritability of IQ was over 0.7 of the ''within''-race IQ variability, and the 0.3 left over was due to non-shared environmental influences.

The work became one of‚Äîif not the most‚Äîcited papers in the [[history]] of [[psychological testing]] and [[Psychometrics|intelligence research]].&lt;ref&gt;While only limited inference can be drawn from citation analysis, the paper has received over 1262 citations according to the [[Institute for Scientific Information|ISI]] [[citation index]] (Aug. 2006), compared with the other influential figures in the area, [[Hans J. Eysenck]]'s 821 citations of &quot;A Revised Version of the Psychoticism Scale&quot; (1987; lead author Eysenck, S. B.G.), [[Charles Spearman]]'s 644 of &quot;General Intelligence Objectively Determined and Measured&quot; (1904), [[James R. Flynn|James Flynn]]'s 402 citations of &quot;Massive IQ gains in 14 Nations ‚Äì What IQ Tests Really Measure&quot; (1987),  [[J. Phillipe Rushton]]'s 394 of &quot;Behavioral-Development and Construct-Validity: the Principle of Aggregation&quot; (1983; lead author with Brainderd C. J., Pressley M.), &quot;[[Linda Gottfredson]]'s 358 of &quot;Circumscription and Compromise: A Developmental Theory of Occupational Aspirations&quot; (1981), and [[Robert J. Sternberg]]'s 239 of &quot;People's Conceptions of Intelligence&quot; (1981; lead author with Conway, BE, Ketron, JL, et al.).&lt;/ref&gt; It sparked a huge academic controversy. Although his paper was widely cited, a random selection of 60 of these citations revealed that 29 of the papers were direct rebuttals or criticisms of Jensen's arguments, 8 cited the paper as an &quot;example of controversy,&quot; 8 used it as a background reference. Only 15 citations of Jensen's paper were in any way supportive of his theories, and 7 of these 15 were only in relation to minor points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.garfield.library.upenn.edu/essays/v3p652y1977-78.pdf |title=High Impact Science and the Case of Arthur Jensen |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the paper was released, students and faculty staged large protests outside Jensen's [[University of California, Berkeley|U.C. Berkeley]] office. Jensen was denied reprints of his work by his [[publisher]] and was not permitted to reply in response to letters of criticism‚Äîboth extremely unusual policies for their day. Many colleagues{{Who|date=January 2010}} at the time felt that even if Jensen's work contained no scientific merit{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}, his treatment was itself against the spirit of science and the free exchange of ideas.
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Jensen1.jpg|right|thumb|Arthur Jensen winning the 2003 [[Kistler Prize]].]] --&gt;
In a later article, Jensen argued that his claims had been misunderstood:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
...nowhere have I &quot;claimed&quot; an &quot;innate deficiency&quot; of intelligence in blacks. My position on this question is clearly spelled out in my most recent book: &quot;The plain fact is that at present there exists no scientifically satisfactory explanation for the differences between the IQ distributions in the black and white populations. The only genuine consensus among well-informed scientists on this topic is that the cause of the difference remains an open question.&quot; (Jensen, 1981a, p. 213).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Thomas Sowell]] wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Professor Jensen pointed out back in 1969 that black children's IQ scores rose by 8 to 10 points after he met with them informally in a play room and then tested them again after they were more relaxed around him. He did this because &quot;I felt these children were really brighter than their IQ would indicate.&quot; What a shame that others seem to have less confidence in black children than Professor Jensen has had.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://townhall.com/columnists/ThomasSowell/2002/10/01/race_and_iq?page=full |title=Race and IQ|author=Thomas Sowell|date=October 1, 2002|accessdate=14 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, Jensen's 1998 [[The g Factor|''The ''g'' Factor: The Science of Mental Ability'']] gives his position suggesting a genetic component is implicated in the white-black difference in IQ. In Chapter 12: Population Differences in ''g'': Causal Hypotheses, Jensen writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The relationship of the ''g'' factor to a number of biological variables and its relationship to the size of the white-black differences on various cognitive tests (i.e., [[Spearman's hypothesis]]) suggests that the average white-black difference in ''g'' has a biological component. Human races are viewed not as discrete, or [[Platonism|Platonic]], categories, but rather as breeding populations that, as a result of natural selection, have come to differ statistically in the relative frequencies of many polymorphic genes. The genetic distances between various populations form a continuous variable that can be measured in terms of differences in gene frequencies. Racial populations differ in many genetic characteristics, some of which, such as brain size, have behavioral and psychometric correlates, particularly ''g''.

In 1994 he was one of 52 signatories on &quot;[[Mainstream Science on Intelligence]],&lt;ref name=&quot;gottfredson&quot;&gt;Gottfredson, Linda (December 13, 1994). [[Mainstream Science on Intelligence]]. ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', p A18.&lt;/ref&gt;&quot; an editorial written by [[Linda Gottfredson]] and published in the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', which declared the consensus of the signing scholars on the meaning and significance of IQ following the publication of the book ''[[The Bell Curve]]''.

In 2005, Jensen's article, co-written with [[J. Philippe Rushton]], named &quot;Thirty Years of Research on Race Differences in Cognitive Ability&quot;, was published in the [[American Psychological Association|APA]] journal ''[[Psychology, Public Policy and Law]]''. They present ten categories of evidence in support of the notion that IQ differences between whites and blacks are partly genetic in origin.&lt;ref name=&quot;30years&quot;&gt;{{cite journal  |author = J.

==Criticism==
[[Melvin Konner]] wrote in the notes to his book ''The Tangled Wing: Biological Constraints on the Human Spirit'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Statements made by Arthur Jensen, William Shockley, and other investigators in the late 1960s and early 1970s about race and IQ or social class and IQ rapidly passed into currency in policy discussions. Many of these statements were proved wrong, but they had already influenced some policymakers, and that influence is very difficult to recant.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Many studies that purport to be both science-based and attempt to influence public policy have been accused of scientific racism. Konner wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
What of the latest currents of thought? Are they likely to lead to, or at least encourage, further distortions of social policy? The indications are not all encouraging. Richard Herrnstein and Charles Murray published a book in 1994 clearly directed at policy, just as Jensen and others had in the 1960s and 1970s. ''The Bell Curve: Intelligence and Class Structure in American Life'' (New York: [[Free Press (publisher)|Free Press]], 1994) teamed a psychologist with a conservative policy advocate to try to prove that both the class structure and the racial divide in the United States result from genetically determined differences in intelligence and ability.

Their general assertions about genes and IQ were not very controversial, but their speculations on race were something else again.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Lisa Suzuki and Joshua Aronson of [[New York University]] wrote in 2005 that Jensen has largely ignored evidence that fails to support his position that IQ test score gaps represent a [[Genetics|genetic]] racial hierarchy unwaveringly for over 30 years.&lt;ref&gt;''The cultural malleability of intelligence and its impact on the racial/ethnic hierarchy'' L Suzuki, J Aronson - Psychology, Public Policy, and Law, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, Jensen has received more than one million dollars from the sometimes controversial [[Pioneer fund]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=1077-3711(199424%2F199524)6%3C58%3ATPFBTP%3E2.0.CO%3B2-X The Pioneer Fund: Bankrolling the Professors of Hate] Adam Miller The Journal of Blacks in Higher Education, No. 6 (Winter, 1994-1995), pp. 58-61&lt;/ref&gt;

Paleontologist and evolutionary biologist [[Stephen Jay Gould]], attacked Jensen's work in his 1981 book ''[[The Mismeasure of Man]]''. Gould writes that Jensen misapplies the concept of &quot;[[heritability]]&quot;, which is defined as a measure of the [[variation]] of a trait due to inheritance ''within'' a population (Gould 1981: 127; 156-157). According to Gould, Jensen uses heritability to measure differences ''between'' populations{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}. Gould also disagrees with Jensen's belief that IQ tests measure a real variable, ''g'', or &quot;the [[general factor]] common to a large number of cognitive abilities&quot; which can be measured along a unilinear scale.

This is a claim most closely identified with [[Charles Spearman]]. According to Gould, Jensen misunderstood the research of [[L. L. Thurstone]] to ultimately support this claim; Gould, however, argues that Thurstone's [[factor analysis]] of intelligence revealed ''g'' to be an illusion (1981: 159; 13-314). Gould criticizes Jensen's sources including his use of [[Catharine Cox]]'s 1926 ''Genetic Studies of Genius'', which examines [[historiometric]]ally the IQs of historic intellectuals after their deaths (Gould 1981: 153-154).

In 1980 Jensen published a detailed book in defense of the tests used to measure mental abilities, entitled ''Bias in Mental Testing''. Reviewing this book, psychologist [[Kenneth Kaye]] endorsed Jensen's distinction between bias and discrimination. The purpose of tests is to discriminate (that is, reveal actual differences) on the basis of ability; bias constitutes error.&lt;ref&gt;K. Kaye, ''The Sciences'', January 1981, pp. 26-28.&lt;/ref&gt; Jensen defined any test as biased for a particular group if that group differs significantly from the majority group in the slopes, intercepts, or standard error of the estimates of their regression lines. Most studies found no difference in the regression lines between black and white groups, but those differences that had been found to be biased had overpredicted rather than underpredicted the minority group's performance (for example, grades in Officer Candidate courses). Jensen's conclusion:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Until we find out what the relevant psychological predictors are for which racial classification per se is merely a 'stand-in' variable, we have no choice but to include race (or other group membership) as a predictive variable along with the test scores or other predictive measures. On the other hand, if the overprediction of the minority group's criterion performance is not too extreme, it may seem reasonable to many to leave it uncorrected, thereby giving the benefit of the slight predictive bias to the presumably disadvantaged group.&lt;ref&gt;A. Jensen, ''Bias in Mental Testing''. Free Press, 1980&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Pointing out that &quot;many of Jensen's opponents allowed their scientific conclusions to be far more biased by their political views than he did, Kaye quoted 18th-century [[David Hume]]: &quot;There is no Method of Reasoning more Common, and yet none more blameable, than in philosophical Debates, to endeavor the Refutation of any Hypothesis, by a Pretext of its dangerous Consequences to Religion and Morality.&quot;

In a 1982 review of ''The Mismeasure of Man'', Jensen gives point-by-point rebuttals to much of Gould's critique, including Gould's treatment of heritability, the &quot;reification&quot; of ''g'', and the use of Thurstone's analysis. Gould responded to Jensen's rebuttals in a revised edition of the book, published in 1996.

==Jensen's response and criticism==
In Arthur Jensen's response to Gould's criticisms, in the paper titled ''The Debunking of Scientific Fossils and Straw Persons''.,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mugu.com/cgi-bin/Upstream/jensen-gould-fossils&lt;/ref&gt; Jensen begins his paper with this observation

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Stephen Jay Gould is a paleontologist at Harvard's Museum of Comparative [[Zoology]] and offers a course at Harvard entitled, &quot;Biology as a Social Weapon.&quot; Apparently the course covers much the same content as does the present book. Having had some personal cause for interest in ideologically motivated attacks on biologically oriented behavioral scientists, I first took notice of Gould when he played a prominent role in a group called [[Science for the People]] and in that group's attack on the theories of Harvard zoologist [[Edward O. Wilson]], a leader in the development of [[sociobiology]]...
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While Jensen recognizes the validity of some of Gould's claims, in many places, he criticizes Gould's general approach

&lt;blockquote&gt;
This charge of a social, value-laden science undoubtedly contains an element of truth. In recent years, however, we recognize this charge as the keystone of the [[Marxist]] interpretation of the history of science.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Jensen adds that Gould made a number of misrepresentations, whether intentional or unintentional, while purporting to present Jensen's own positions

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In his references to my own work, Gould includes at least nine citations that involve more than just an expression of Gould's opinion; in these citations Gould purportedly paraphrases my views. Yet in eight of the nine cases, Gould's representation of these views is false, misleading, or grossly caricatured. Nonspecialists could have no way of knowing any of this without reading the cited sources. While an author can occasionally make an inadvertent mistake in paraphrasing another, it appears Gould's paraphrases are consistently slanted to serve his own message.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Recent books==
===The ''g'' Factor===
''The ''g'' Factor: The Science of Mental Ability'' (1998) is considered by supporters to be Jensen's magnum opus on the [[general intelligence factor]] (''g''). The book deals with the intellectual history of g and various models of how to conceptualize intelligence, and with the biological correlates of g, its heritability, and its practical predictive power.

===Clocking the Mind===
''Clocking the Mind : Mental Chronometry and Individual Differences'' (2006) deals with [[mental chronometry]] (MC), and covers a variety of techniques for measuring the speed with which the brain processes information.  Whereas [[IQ]] merely represents an interval (ranking) scale and thus possesses no true ratio scale properties, Jensen argues mental chronometry represents a true natural science of mental ability.

:''This article is about the musical.  The film article is [[A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum (film)]]''

'''''A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum''''' is a [[Musical theatre|musical]] with music and lyrics by [[Stephen Sondheim]] and book by [[Burt Shevelove]] and [[Larry Gelbart]].  

Inspired by the [[farce]]s of the [[Ancient Rome|ancient Roman]] playwright [[Plautus]] (251&amp;ndash;183 BC), specifically ''[[Pseudolus]]'', ''[[Miles Gloriosus (play)|Miles Gloriosus]]'' and ''[[Mostellaria]]'', it tells the bawdy story of a [[slavery|slave]] named Pseudolus and his attempts to win his freedom by helping his young master woo the girl next door.  The plot displays many classic elements of [[farce]], including puns, the slamming of doors, cases of [[mistaken identity]] (frequently involving characters disguising themselves as one another), and satirical comments on social class. The title derives from the line that [[vaudeville]] comedians often used to begin a story: &quot;A funny thing happened on the way to the theater&quot;.

The musical's original 1962 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] run won several [[Tony Awards]], including Best Musical and Best Book.  ''A Funny Thing'' has enjoyed several Broadway and [[West End theatre|West End]] revivals and was made into a successful film starring the original lead of the play, [[Zero Mostel]]. 

==Productions==
===Original Broadway production===
''A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum'' opened on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] on May 8, 1962 at the [[Neil Simon Theatre|Alvin Theatre]], and then transferred to the [[Mark Hellinger Theatre]] and the [[Majestic Theatre]], where the show closed on August 29, 1964, after 964 performances and 8 previews.

The show's creators originally wanted [[Phil Silvers]] in the lead role of [[Pseudolus]], but he turned them down, allegedly because he would have to perform onstage without his glasses, and his vision was so poor that he feared tripping into the orchestra pit. (Silvers went on to play the role in a 1972 revival.) [[Milton Berle]] also passed on the role.  Eventually, [[Zero Mostel]] was cast.&lt;ref name=green&gt;Green, Syanley and Green, Kay.[http://books.google.com/books?id=KDKFHniTy1YC&amp;lpg=PA198&amp;dq=%22Phil%20Silvers%22%20%22A%20Funny%20Thing%20Happened%20on%20the%20Way%20to%20the%20Forum%22%20Sondheim&amp;pg=PA198#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Phil%20Silvers%22%20%22A%20Funny%20Thing%20Happened%20on%20the%20Way%20to%20the%20Forum%22%20Sondheim&amp;f=false &quot;A Funny Thing Happened on the Way To the Forum&quot;]''Broadway Musicals, Show By Show'' (1996), (books.google) Hal Leonard Corporation, ISBN 0-7935-7750-0, p. 198&lt;/ref&gt;  

During the out of town pre-Broadway tryouts the show was attracting little business and not playing well. [[Jerome Robbins]] was called in by director [[George Abbott]] and producer [[Hal Prince]] to give advice and make changes. The biggest change Robbins made was a new opening number to replace &quot;Love Is in the Air&quot; and introduce the show as a bawdy, wild comedy. Stephen Sondheim wrote the song &quot;Comedy Tonight&quot; for this new opening.&lt;ref name=green/&gt;  From that point on, the show was a success.

It was directed by George Abbott and produced by Hal Prince, with choreography by [[Jack Cole]] and uncredited staging and choreography by Jerome Robbins. The scenic and costume design was by [[Tony Walton]]. This wardrobe is on display at the Costume World Broadway Collection in Pompano Beach, Florida. The lighting design was by [[Jean Rosenthal]].  Along with Mostel, the musical featured a cast of seasoned performers, including [[Jack Gilford]] (Mostel's friend and fellow blacklist member), [[David Burns (actor)|David Burns]], [[John Carradine]], [[Ruth Kobart]] and [[Raymond Walburn]]. The young lovers were played by [[Brian Davies (actor)|Brian Davies]] and [[Preshy Marker]]. [[Karen Black]], originally cast as the ingenue, was replaced out of town.

The show won several [[Tony Award]]s: best musical, best actor, best supporting actor (Burns), best book, and best director. The score, Sondheim's first time on Broadway writing both words and music, was coolly received, however, not even garnering a nomination.

===West End productions===
The show was presented three times in London's West End. The 1963 production and its 1986 revival were staged at the [[Novello Theatre|Strand Theatre]] and the [[Piccadilly Theatre]] respectively,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guidetomusicaltheatre.com/london_shows_chronology/1963.htm Listing, 1963 production] guidetomusicaltheatre.com, retrieved December 9, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thisistheatre.com/shows/piccadilly111.html Listing, 1986 production] thisistheatre.com, retrieved December 9, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and featured [[Frankie Howerd]] starring as Pseudolus, [[Kenneth Connor]] as Hysterium, [['Monsewer' Eddie Gray]] as Senex, [[Jon Pertwee]] as Marcus Lycus and [[Leon Greene]] as Miles Gloriosus. (Howerd went on to star in ''[[Up Pompeii!]]'', a 1969 British television comedy series set in ancient Pompeii, as the slave Lurcio, whose character was based on Pseudolus'.) 

In 2004 there was a limited-run revival at the [[Royal National Theatre]] starring [[Desmond Barrit]] as Pseudolus, [[Philip Quast]] as Miles Gloriosus, [[Hamish McColl]] as Hysterium and [[Isla Blair]] as Domina (who had previously played Philia in the 1963 production).&lt;ref&gt;Inverne, James.[http://www.playbill.com/news/article/86645-Thoroughly_Modern_Millie_Closes_in_London_as_New_Musicals_Prepare_to_Open &quot;Thoroughly Modern Millie Closes in London as New Musicals Prepare to Open&quot;] playbill.com, June 7, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

===Motion picture adaptation===
{{main|A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum (film)}}
''A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum'' was made into a [[musical film]] in 1966, directed by [[Richard Lester]], with [[Zero Mostel]] and [[Jack Gilford]] re-creating their Broadway stage roles, [[Leon Greene]] reprising his West End stage role and [[Phil Silvers]] starred in an expanded role as &quot;Marcus Lycus&quot;. [[David Burns (actor)|David Burns]] did not return for the film role of [[Senex]], which was played in the film by [[Michael Hordern]]. [[Buster Keaton]] made his final film appearance in the role of Erronius.

===Broadway revivals===
In 1972 there was a critically well-received Broadway [[Revival (theatre)|revival]], directed by co-author [[Burt Shevelove]] and starring [[Phil Silvers]] as Pseudolus (followed later by [[Tom Poston]] in the role), [[Lew Parker]] as Senex and [[Reginald Owen]] as Erronius. [[Larry Blyden]], who played Hysterium, the role created by Jack Gilford, also co-produced. Two songs were dropped from the show, and two new Sondheim songs were added. The new songs included in this production had been added during a 1971 Los Angeles production: &quot;Echo Song&quot; (sung by Hero and Philia), and &quot;Farewell&quot; (added for [[Nancy Walker]] playing the role of Domina as she and Senex depart for the country). The production ran 156 performances, but had to close soon after Phil Silvers suffered a stroke. The show won Tonys for Silvers and Blyden.

The musical was also revived with great success in 1996, starring [[Nathan Lane]] as Pseudolus (replaced later in the run by [[Whoopi Goldberg]] and also by [[David Alan Grier]]), [[Mark Linn-Baker]] as Hysterium, [[Ernie Sabella]] as Lycus, [[Jim Stanek]] as Hero, [[Lewis J. Stadlen]] as Senex, and Cris Groenendaal as Miles Gloriosus. The production, directed by [[Jerry Zaks]], ran for 715 performances. Lane won the Best Actor Tony for his work.

Every actor who has opened in the role of Pseudolus on Broadway  (Zero Mostel, Phil Silvers and Nathan Lane) won a Best Actor Tony for their performance. In addition, [[Jason Alexander]], who performed as Pseudolus in one scene in [[Jerome Robbins' Broadway]], also won a Tony for Best Actor in a Musical.

===Other productions===
The [[Stephen Sondheim Center for the Performing Arts]] produced a limited-run revival of the musical from January 11 to 27, 2008. The production was directed by Randal K. West, with Justin Hill as musical director and Adam Cates as choreographer. The cast featured [[Richard Kind]] as Pseudolus, Joel Blum as Senex, [[Stephen DeRosa]] as Marcus Lycus, Sean McCall as Hysterium, and Steve Wilson as Miles Gloriosus.  It also featured Diana Upton-Hill, Ryan Gaffney, Stephen Mark Crisp, Jack Kloppenborg and Margret Clair.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gazetteonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080117/FEATURES/660746609/1006/NEWS gazettonline article, 1/14/08]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theatermania.com/content/news.cfm/story/12431 theatermania.com article, 1/4/08]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gans, Andrew.[http://www.playbill.com/news/article/114148.html &quot;Tragedy Tomorrow, Comedy Tonight: Forum Begins Run at Sondheim Center&quot;], playbill.com, January 11, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chung Ying Theatre Company in Hong Kong staged a Cantonese version of the musical at [[Kwai Tsing Theatre]], to celebrate the company's 30th anniversary. It was directed by [[Chung King Fai]] and Ko Tin Lung and ran from 14 to 21 March 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chungying.com/09funnything/about.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Stratford Shakespeare Festival]] in [[Stratford, Ontario|Stratford]], Ontario, Canada production ran from June 11 to November 7, 2009, with [[Des McAnuff]] directing and [[Wayne Cilento]] as choreographer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stratfordfestival.ca/plays/2009_playbill.cfm?Jump=Playbill2009&amp;Play=Forum#forum Stratford Festival schedule]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bruce Dow]] originally performed the role of Pseudolus, but was forced to withdraw from the entire 2009 season due to an injury, and the role was then performed by [[Sean Cullen]] as of September 5, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theatermania.com/canada/news/08-2009/sean-cullen-to-replace-injured-bruce-dow-in-stratf_20718.html &quot;Article, Cullen to Replace Injured Dow&quot;] theatermania.com&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stephen Ouimette]] plays Hysterium. In February 2010, Mirvish Productions announced that will become part of its 2010/2011 season, opening in Toronto in December 2010. Bruce Dow and Sean Cullen will alternate the lead role.&lt;ref&gt;Mirvish Productions website http://www.mirvish.com/homepagefeature/anewseason Accessed 22 February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br&gt;

==Plot==
[[Image:Forum LP cover.jpg|thumb|left|180px|&lt;center&gt;Graphic from the original Broadway cast album&lt;/center&gt;]]
In ancient Rome, some neighbors live in three adjacent houses.  In the center is the house of Senex, who lives there with wife Domina, son Hero, and several slaves, including head slave Hysterium and the musical's main character Pseudolus. A slave belonging to Hero, he wishes to buy, win, or steal his freedom. One of the neighboring houses is owned by Marcus Lycus, who is a buyer and seller of beautiful women; the other belongs to the ancient Erronius, who is abroad searching for his long-lost children (stolen in [[infant|infancy]] by [[Piracy|pirates]]).

One day, Senex and Domina go on a trip and leave Pseudolus in charge of Hero.  Hero confides in Pseudolus that he is in love with the lovely Philia, one of the courtesans in the House of Lycus.  Pseudolus promises to help him win Philia's love in exchange for his freedom.  Unfortunately (as the two find out when they pay a visit on Lycus), Philia has been promised to the renowned warrior Captain Miles Gloriosus, who is on his way to claim her.  Pseudolus, an excellent liar, uses Philia's cheery disposition to convince Lycus that she has picked up a [[Yersinia pestis|plague]] from [[Crete]], which causes its victims to smile endlessly in its terminal stages.  By offering to isolate her in Senex's house, he is able to give Philia and Hero some time alone together, and the two fall in love. But Philia insists that, even though she is in love with Hero, she must honor her contract with the Captain, for &quot;that is the way of a courtesan.&quot;  To appease her, he tells her to wait (&quot;that's what virgins do best, isn't it?&quot;) inside, and that he will have the captain knock three times when he arrives.  Pseudolus comes up with a plan to slip Philia a sleeping potion that will render her unconscious.  He will then tell Lycus that she has died of the Cretan plague, and will offer to remove the body.  Hero will come along, and they will stow away on a ship headed for Greece.  Satisfied with his plan, Pseudolus steals Hysterium's book of potions and has Hero read him the recipe for the sleeping potion; the only ingredient he lacks is &quot;mare's sweat,&quot; and Pseudolus goes off in search of some.

Unexpectedly, Senex returns home early from his trip, and knocks three times on his own door.  Philia comes out of the house, and, thinking that Senex is the Captain, offers herself up to him.  Surprised but game, Senex instructs Philia to wait in the house for him, and she does.  Hysterium arrives to this confusion, and tells Senex that Philia is the new maid that he has hired.  Pseudolus returns, having procured the necessary mare's sweat; seeing that Senex has returned unexpectedly and grasping the need to keep him out of the way, Pseudolus discreetly sprinkles some of the horse-sweat onto him, then suggests that the road trip has left Senex in dire need of a bath.  Taking the bait, Senex instructs Hysterium to draw him a bath in the long-abandoned house of Erronius.  But while this is happening, Erronius returns home, finally having given up the search for his long-lost children.  Hysterium, desperate to keep him out of the house where his master is bathing, tells the old man that his house has become haunted‚Äîa story seemingly confirmed by the sound of Senex singing in his bath.  Erronius immediately determines to have a soothsayer come and banish the spirit from his house, and Pseudolus obligingly poses as one, telling Erronius that in order to banish the spirit, he must travel seven times around the seven hills of Rome (thus keeping the old man occupied and out of the way for quite a while). 

When Miles Gloriosus arrives to claim his courtesan-bride, Pseudolus hides Philia on the roof of Senex's house; told that she has &quot;escaped,&quot; Lycus is terrified to face the Captain's wrath.  Pseudolus offers to impersonate Lycus and talk his way out of the mess but, his ingenuity flagging, he ends up merely telling the Captain that Philia has disappeared, and that he, &quot;Lycus,&quot; will set out in search of her.  Displeased and suspicious, Miles insists that his soldiers accompany Pseudolus, but the wily slave is able to lose them in Rome's winding streets.

Complicating matters further, Domina returns from her trip early, suspicious that her husband Senex is &quot;up to something low.&quot;  She disguises herself in virginal white robes and a veil (much like Philia's) in order to try and catch Senex being unfaithful.  Pseudolus convinces Hysterium to help him by dressing in [[Drag (clothing)|drag]] and pretending to be Philia, &quot;dead&quot; from the plague.  Unfortunately, it turns out that Miles Gloriosus has just returned from Crete, where there is of course no actual plague.  With the ruse thus revealed, the main characters run for their lives, resulting in a madcap chase across the stage with both Miles and Senex pursuing all three &quot;Philia&quot;s (Domina, Hysterium, and the actual Philia -- all wearing identical white robes and veils).  Meanwhile, the courtesans from the house of Marcus Lycus &amp;ndash; who had been recruited as mourners at &quot;Philia&quot;'s ersatz funeral &amp;ndash; have escaped, and Lycus sends his [[Eunuch (court official)|eunuch]]s out to bring them all back, adding to the general pandemonium.

Finally, the Captain's troops are able to round everyone up.  His plot thoroughly unraveled, Pseudolus appears to be in deep trouble‚Äîbut Erronius, midway through his fourth circuit of the Roman hills, shows up fortuitously to discover that Miles Gloriosus and Philia are wearing matching rings which mark them as his long-lost children.  Her betrothal to the Captain obviously nullified by the unexpected revelation that he's actually her brother, Philia weds Hero; Pseudolus gets his freedom, Gloriosus receives twin courtesans to replace Philia, Erronius gets his children, and a happy ending prevails for all -- except for poor Senex, stuck with his shrewish wife Domina.

'''Aleut people''' ({{IPA-en|Àà√¶l.i.uÀêt}}, {{Audio|Aleut.ogg|pronunciation}}) are the [[Alaska Natives|indigenous people]] of the [[Aleutian Islands]] of [[Alaska]], [[United States]] and [[Kamchatka Krai]], [[Russia]].

==Name==
The name &quot;Aleut&quot; cames from [[Aleut language|Aleut word]] ''all√≠thuh'', meaning &quot;community.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;According to G. Menovshchikov; quoted in &quot;Red Book of the Peoples of the Russian Empire&quot;, http://www.eki.ee/books/redbook/aleuts.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; A regional self-denomination is '''{{unicode|UnangaxÃÇ}}''', '''Unangan''' or '''Unanga''', meaning &quot; coastal people.&quot; The name Aleut was given to the Unangan by Russian fur traders in the mid-18th century.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mnsu.edu/emuseum/cultural/northamerica/aleuts.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Population and distribution==
{{For|specific tribal village names|List of Alaska Native tribal entities}}

–¢he Aleut people were distributed throughout the Aleutian Islands, the [[Shumagin Islands]], and the far western part of the [[Alaska Peninsula]], with an estimated population of around 25,000 before contact with Europeans.&lt;ref name=Britannica&gt;Aleut. (2011). In Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Retrieved from http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/13914/Aleut&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1820s century, the [[Russian-American Company]], which administered a large portion of the North Pacific during a Russian led expansion of the [[fur trade]], resettled many families to the [[Commander Islands]] (currently, within the [[Aleutsky District]] of the [[Kamchatka Krai]] in Russia)&lt;ref&gt;Lyapunova, R.G. (1987) Aleuts: Noted on their ethnological history (in Russian)&lt;/ref&gt; and to the [[Pribilof Islands]] (currently in [[Alaska]]), where there are currently established majority Aleut communities.&lt;ref&gt;Bonner, W. N. (1982) Seals and Man: A Study of Interactions. Seattle: University of Washington Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Corbett, H.D. and S. M Swibold.  (2000) The Aleuts of the Pribilof Islands, Alaska. book chapter in &quot;Endangered people of the Arctic. Struggle to Survive&quot;. Edited: Milton M.R. Freeman. http://www.amiq.org/aleuts.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Their numbers have dwindled to about 2,000 as a consequence of disease and disruption of traditional lifestyles, though people with partial Aleut descent may number around 15,000.&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt;

==History ==
After the arrival of [[missionary|missionaries]] in the late 18th century, many Aleuts became [[Christianity|Christian]] by joining the [[Russian Orthodox Church]]. One of the earliest Christian martyrs in [[North America]] was Saint [[Peter the Aleut]].

In 18th century, [[Russia]]n furriers [[Promyshlenniki]] established settlements on the islands and exploited the people.

There was a recorded revolt against Russian workers in [[Amchitka]] in 1784. It started from the exhaustion of necessities that the Russians provided to local people in return for furs they had made. 

In 1811, in order to obtain more of the now commercially valuable otter pelts, a party of Aleut hunters traveled to the [[San Nicolas Island|coastal island of San Nicolas]], near the [[Baja_California_peninsula#Partition|Alta California-Baja California border]]. The locally resident [[Nicole√±o|Nicole√±o nation]] sought a payment from the Aleut hunters for the large number of otters being killed in the area. Disagreement arose, turning violent; in the ensuing battle nearly all Nicole√±o men were killed. This, along with European diseases, so impacted the Nicole√±os, that by 1853, only one living Nicole√±a person remained. (See [[Juana Maria|Juana Maria, The Lone Woman of San Nicolasa]])

Prior to major influence from outside, there were approximately 25,000 Aleuts on the archipelago.  Barbarities by outside corporations and foreign diseases soon reduced the population to less than one-tenth this number, The 1910 [[Census]] count showed 1,491 Aleuts. In the 2000 Census, 11,941 people reported they were of Aleut ancestry; nearly 17,000 said Aleuts were among their ancestors.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The American Indian and Alaska Native Population: 2000&quot;, Table 5 found at http://www.census.gov/prod/2002pubs/c2kbr01-15.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Alaskans generally recognize the Russian occupation left no full-blooded Aleuts. When Alaska Natives enrolled in their regional corporations under the terms of the [[Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act]] of 1971 (ANCSA), the Aleut Corporation attracted only about 2,000 enrolees who could prove a blood quantum of 1/4 or more Alaska Native (including Aleut).

In 1942, during [[World War II]], Japanese forces occupied [[Attu Island|Attu]] and [[Kiska]] Islands in the western Aleutians, and later transported captive Attu Islanders to [[Hokkaid≈ç]], where they were held as [[prisoners of war]]. Hundreds more Aleuts from the western chain and the Pribilofs were evacuated by the United States government during WW2 and placed in internment camps in southeast Alaska, where many died. The [[Aleut Restitution Act of 1988]] was an attempt by [[United States Congress|Congress]] to compensate the survivors.

The [[Aleutian Islands campaign|World War II campaign]] to retake Attu and Kiska was a significant component of the operations of the Pacific theater.

===Recorded revolt===
In May of 1784, according to [[Hokusa bunryaku]]([[:ja:ÂåóÊßéËÅûÁï•|ÂåóÊßéËÅûÁï•]]) written by [[Katsuragawa Hosh≈´]] interviewing [[Daikokuya K≈çday≈´]], local [[Amchitka]] people revolted against the Russians. According to what Aleut people told Japanese castaways, otters were decreasing year by year and their share in return of furs they made also were decreasing as Russian ships stopped coming to the island. The castaways felt that the people had a sense of crisis to their situation. There were some negotiations with higher Aleut people about necessities that the Russians had run out of and that they had given to Aleuts in return for furs. After that, by Nevizimov's order, two Russians, Stepano(„Çπ„ÉÜ„ÉÉ„Éë„Éé) and Kazhimov(„Ç´„Ç∏„É¢„Éï), killed the chieftain's daughter and Nevizimov's mistress, Oniishin(„Ç™„Éã„Ç§„Ç∑„É≥), because Russians had doubted that Oniishin pushed islanders' back. That evening, hundreds of Aleuts started gathering on a mountain and marched to the Russians' houses. Five Russians opened fire, and Aleuts ran away. They attempted another attack the next day. They yelled and moved more quickly towards the house. Nevertheless, as Russians opened fire, they started to run away again. After they ran, Russians noticed that all the men were discussing their act on a mountain. The Russians took around forty women and children hostage while the men were not in the village. The Aleuts surrendered. Four higher Aleut people had been executed.
After the incident, the Aleuts began to move from Amchitka to neighboring islands.
The leader of the Russians, Nevizimov was jailed after the whole incident was reported to Russian officials.&lt;ref name=&quot;kodayu&quot;&gt;Yamashita, Tsuneo ''Daikokuya Kodayu''(Japanese) 2004. Iwanami, Japan ISBN 4004308798&lt;/ref&gt;

== Culture and technology ==
Aleuts constructed partially underground houses called ''[[Barabara]]''.  According to [[Lillie McGarvey]], a 20th-century Aleut leader, ''barabaras'' keep &quot;occupants dry from the frequent rains, warm at all times, and snugly sheltered from the high winds common to the area&quot;. First a rectangular pit was dug. Then it was covered with logs and poles and then sealed by earth and moss. Inside there would  be benches along the side with the hearth in the middle. The bedrooms were at the back of the lodge.

Fishing, hunting and gathering were the only way Aleuts could find food. Salmon, seal, walrus, crabs, shellfish, cod were all caught and dried, smoked or roasted. Caribou, musk oxen, deer, moose, whale and other types of game were eaten roasted or preserved. Berries were dried or often whipped into ''alutiqqutigaq'', which was a mixture of berries, fat and fish. The skin and blubber from a whale which was boiled was a delicacy and so was walrus.
These days Aleuts eat their traditional food but also with the new processed foods the outside world brought in.

===Art===
Traditional arts of the Aleuts include hunting, weapon-making, building of ''[[baidarka]]s'' (special hunting boats), [[weaving]], figurine making, clothing, carving, and mask making. Ivory and woodcarving were and are prevalent crafts for Aleut men to create, too.  19th century craftsmen were famed for their ornate wooden hunting hats, which feature elaborate and colorful designs and may be trimmed with [[sea lion]] [[Vibrissae|whiskers]], feathers, and [[ivory]]. [[Andrew Gronholdt]] of the Shumagin Islands played a vital role in reviving the ancient art of building the ''chaguda-x'' or traditional bentwood hats.&lt;ref&gt;Black, Lydia T. ''Aleut Art:  Unangam Aguqaadangin''.  Anchorage, Alaska:  Aleutian/Pribilof Islands Association, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Aleut seamstresses created finely stitched waterproof ''[[parka]]s'' from [[Seal (mammal)|seal]] gut, and some women still master the skill of weaving fine baskets from [[dune wildrye]] grass or ''[[Elymus mollis]]''. Aleut arts are still very much alive today and are practiced and taught through out the state of Alaska. Many Aleuts now live across the state and not only in the Aleutians which has helped to spread the arts of their people and to better develop methods of creating their arts. Many old methods had been lost during the periods of European contact. 

Aleut carvings are distinct in each region and have attracted traders for centuries. Including early European traders and other Native Alaskan cultures. Historically carving was a male art and leadership attribute; in today‚Äôs world it is an art of both sexes. Most commonly the carvings of ivory and wood were for the purpose of hunting weapons. Other times the carvings were created to depict commonly seen animals, such as: seals, whales, and even humans.&lt;ref name=AAUA&gt;{{cite book|last=Black|first=Lydia|title=Aleut Art Unangam Aguqaadangin|year=2003|publisher=Aleutian/Pribilof Islands Association|location=Anchorage, AK}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Aleuts use ivory in many other types of carvings. Jewelry is one of the most prominent, accompanied by sewing needles. Jewelry of the Aleuts is also specific to which region it hails from. Each clan would have a specific style to signify their origin. The ornaments used as jewelry consisted of: Lip piercings, nose piercings, necklaces, ear piercings, and piercings through the flesh under the bottom lip. Sewing needles were special to the sewer and were custom made, often with a detailed end that had animal heads.&lt;ref name=&quot;AAUA&quot;/&gt; 

Aleut [[basketry]] is some of the finest in the world, and the tradition began in prehistoric times.The main method of basketry used by the Aleuts was false embroidery (overlay). In this method strands are overlayed upon the basic weaving surface to obtain a plastic effect. Basketry was an art reserved for women.&lt;ref name=&quot;AAUA&quot;/&gt;  Early Aleut women created baskets and woven mats of exceptional technical quality using only an elongated and sharpened thumbnail as a tool. Today, Aleut weavers continue to produce woven grass pieces of a remarkable cloth-like texture, works of modern art with roots in ancient tradition.Birch bark, puffin feathers, and baleen are also commonly used by the Aleuts in basketry. The Aleut term for grass basket is ''qiigam aygaaxsii''.  One Aleut leader recognized by the State of Alaska for her work in teaching and reviving Aleut basketry was [[Anfesia Shapsnikoff]] whose life and accomplishments are portrayed in &quot;Moments Rightly Placed.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hudson, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

Masks are full of meaning in the Aleut culture. For instance, the Atka people believed that another people lived in their land before them. These people are displayed through the masks created by the Atka‚Äôs. The masks show anthropomorphic creatures that are described in Aleut language. The translation is ‚Äúlike those found in caves‚Äù as translated by Knut Bergsland. Masks were generally carved from wood and were decorated with paints made from berries or other earthly products. Feathers were also inserted into holes carved out for extra decoration. These masks were used from ceremonies to dances to praises, each with its own meaning and purpose.&lt;ref name=&quot;AAUA&quot;/&gt;

===Tattoos and Piercings===
The tattoos and piercings of the Aleut people demonstrated not only their accomplishments in life but their religious views.  Their body art was thought to please the spirits of the animals and ward off any evil.  The body orifices were believed to be highways that evil entities traveled through.  By piercing their orifices, the nose, the mouth, and ears, they would stop evil entities, ‚ÄúKhoughkh‚Äù, from entering their bodies (Osborn, 52). Body art also enhanced their beauty, social status, and spiritual authority.  

Before the 19th century, tattoos and piercings were very common among the Aleut people, especially among women.  Tattooing for women began when they reached maturity, or menstruation, at about age twenty.  For men, traditionally, their first tattoo was done when they killed their first animal.  Sometimes tattoos signaled social class.  For example, the daughter of a rich, famous ancestor or father would work hard at her tattoos to show the accomplishments of that ancestor or father.  They would sew, or prick, different designs on the chin, the side of the face, or under the nose.  

From Russian arrival in the Aleutian Islands in 1786 through the mid-19th century, the Russians invaded and enslaved the natives, and many of the Aleut customs disappeared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Krutak|first=Lars|title=Tattooing and Piercing among the Alaskan Aleut|url=http://www.larskrutak.com/articles/Aleut/|accessdate=28 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Russians, although very intrigued by their body art, thought their piercings and tattoos were ‚Äúhideous‚Äù and made the younger women believe that body art did not make them attractive.  Even the Christian missionaries said they were savage looking and tried to alter how the Aleuts dressed and groomed themselves.
   
Piercings such as the nose pin were common among both men and women and were usually performed a few days after birth.  The ornament used for the piercing was made out of various materials, a piece of bark or bone, or an eagle‚Äôs feather shaft.  From time to time, women would decorate the nose pins by hanging pieces of amber and coral from strings that would dangle down to their chins.  

Piercing ears was also very common.  The Aleuts pierced holes around the rim of their ears with dentalium shells (tooth shells or tusk shells), bone, feathers, dried bird wings or skulls and/or amber. The use of birds was very meaningful to these people because birds were seen as defending animals in the spirit world.  Sea lion whiskers worn in male‚Äôs ears represented a trophy, which meant he was a good hunter. Worn for decorative reasons, and sometimes to signify social standing, reputation, and the age of the wearer, Aleuts would pierce their lower lips with walrus ivory and wear beads or bones.  The individual with the most piercings would hold the highest respect.

===Aleut clothing===
[[File:Parka (Kamleika) Aleutian Islands.JPG|thumb|200px|A Kamleika, or seal skin coat]]
The Aleut people live in one of the harshest parts of the world.  The Aleutian chain is full of materials for them to use and with the skills of both men and women protective garments were made out of materials on both land and sea and nothing was wasted.  Both men and women wore parka‚Äôs below the knees.  The women wore the skin of seal or sea-otter and the men wore bird skin parkas that had the feathers inside and out depending on the weather.  When the men were hunting on the water they wore waterproof parkas made from seal or sea-lion guts, or the entrails of bear, walrus, and whales.  It had a hood that could be cinched as well as around the wrists so water could not get in.  Men wore breeches made from esophagus skin of the seal.  Children wore parkas made of downy eagle skin with tanned bird skin caps.(Enthnohistory: Gross &amp; Khera pg 33, 34). They called these parkas ‚ÄúKameikas‚Äù for raingear in the English language K(Aleut Corp. Web.).

Sea-lion, harbor seal, and the sea otter are the most abundant marine animals.  The men brought home the skins and prepared them by soaking them in urine and stretching them.  The women undertook the sewing (Enthnohistory:  Gross &amp; Khera pg.32).   Gut sewing involved turning the intestines inside out and using a bone knife to get the inside muscular coating and fat from the walls of the intestine.  The gut was then cut and stretched and fastened to stakes to dry and then made into waterproof parkas, bags and other recepticles (Turner Ch. 5 pg. 70).  On some trips the men would take several women with them and their duty was to catch the birds and prepare them for future use.  They caught Puffins, Lunda Cirrhata, Fratercula Corniculata, Guillemots, and Cephus &amp; Murres (Lucienm M. Turner pg. 70).

One parka took a year to make and would last two years with proper care.  It took 40 skins of tufted puffin and 60 skins of horned puffin to make one parka.  All parkas were decorated with bird feathers, beard bristles of seal and sea-lion, beaks of sea parrots, bird claws, sea otter fur, dyed leather, and caribou hair sewn in the seams. (Gross &amp; Khera pg. 34).

Women made needles from the wingbones of seabirds and the thread was made of sinews of different animals and fish guts (Gross &amp; Khera pg. 33).  A thin strip of seal intestine was also used and was twisted to form a thread.  The women would grow their thumbnail extra long so they could split the threads a fine as a hair (Turner pg. 71).  They made different colors of threads out of Vermilion paint, hematite, the ink bag of the octopus and the root of a kind of grass or vine were used to give different colors to the threads (Turner Ch. 5 pg. 71).  They used paint and made it out of various colored rocks.  Powdered the rocks and mixed it with blood of a Raven or other land bird (Turner pg. 73).

===Hunting Technologies===
[[File:Inuit hunter with harpoon.jpg|thumb|300px|Aleut hunter with harpoon in Baidarka, Hudson Bay, circa 1908-1914]]

The interior regions of the rough, mountainous Aleutian Islands were unable to offer much support to the Aleutian people. From the land they could only meet a few needs, such as stone for weapons, tools, stoves or lamps and grass for their woven baskets. For everything else, the Aleuts turned to the sea.&lt;ref name=AHC&gt;{{cite book|last=Antonson|first=Joan|title=Alaska's Heritage|year=1984|publisher=The Alaska Historical Commision|location=Anchorage|pages=85‚Äì95}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In order to hunt sea mammals and to travel between islands, the Aleuts became experts of sailing and navigation. While hunting they used small watercrafts called '''''Baidarkas''''' and during travel they used their large '''''Baidaras'''''.&lt;ref name=&quot;AHC&quot;/&gt; 

The '''''baidara (large skin boat)''''' was a large open walrus skin-covered boat used by Aleut families to travel from island to island, as well as, transport goods for trade and warriors to battle.&lt;ref name=CCP&gt;{{cite book|last=Durham|first=Bill|title=Canoes and Kayaks of Western America|year=1960|publisher=Copper Canoe Press|location=Seattle|pages=11‚Äì20}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The '''''baidarka (small skin boat)''''' was a small boat covered in sea lion skin that was used for hunting because of its sturdiness and maneuverability.  The '''''Aleut baidarka''''' resembled that of an '''''Eskimo Kayak''''', however, it was designed to be much more aerodynamically fast which was perfect for sea hunting. A '''''baidarka''''' came in only two models, a one person and a two-person seat. The deck was made with a sturdy chamber, the sides of the craft were nearly vertical and the bottom was rounded. Most one-man '''''baidarka'''''s were about sixteen feet long and twenty inches wide, whereas a two man was on average about twenty feet long and twenty-four inches wide. It was from the '''''baidarka''''' that Aleut men would stand on the water to hunt from the sea.&lt;ref name=&quot;CCP&quot;/&gt;

The Aleuts hunted small sea mammals with barbed darts and harpoons slung from '''''throwing boards'''''. These boards gave precision as well as some extra distance to these weapons.&lt;ref name=AIA&gt;{{cite book|last=Jochelson|first=Waldemar|title=Archaeological Investigations In The Aleutian Islands|year=1925|publisher=University of Utah Press|location=Salt Lake City|pages=145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harpoons were also called ''throwing-arrows'' when the pointed head fit loosely into the socket of the foreshaft and the head was able to detach from the harpoon when it penetrated an animal, and remain in the wound. There were three main kinds of harpoon that the Aleut‚Äôs used: a '''''simple harpoon''''', with a head that kept its original position in the animal after striking, a '''''compound (toggle-head) harpoon''''' in which the head took a horizontal position in the animal after penetration, and the '''''throwing-lance''''' used to kill large animals.&lt;ref name=&quot;AIA&quot;/&gt;

'''''The simple Aleut harpoon''''' consisted of four main parts: the wooden shaft, the bone foreshaft, and the bonehead (tip) with barbs pointed backward. The barbed head was loosely fitted into the socket of the foreshaft so that when the animal was stabbed, it pulled the head away from the rest of the harpoon. The sharp barbs penetrated with ease, but could not be pulled out. The bone tip is fastened to a length of braided twine meanwhile; the hunter held the other end of the twine in his hand.&lt;ref name=&quot;AIA&quot;/&gt;

'''''The compound harpoon''''' was the most prevalent weapon of the Aleut people. Also known as the toggle-head spear, it was about the same size as the simple harpoon and used to hunt the same animals, however, this harpoon provided a more efficient and lethal weapon. This harpoon separated into four parts. The longest part was the shaft with the thicker stalk closer to the tip of the harpoon. The shaft was fitted into the socket of the fore shaft and a bone ring was then placed over the joint to hold the two pieces together, as well as, protecting the wooden shaft from splitting. Connected to the fore shaft of the harpoon is the toggle head spear tip. This tip was made of two sub shafts that break apart on impact with an animal. The upper sub shaft held the razor stone head and attached to the lower sub shaft with a small braided twine loop. Once the tip penetrates the animal the upper sub head broke off from the rest of the shaft, however, since it was still connected with the braided loop it rotated the head into a horizontal position inside the animal‚Äôs body so that it could not get away from the hunter.&lt;ref name=&quot;AIA&quot;/&gt;

'''''The throwing-lance''''' may be distinguished from a harpoon because of the fact that all its pieces are fixed and immovable. A lance is formerly a weapon of war and it was also used to kill large marine animals after it has already been harpooned. The Throwing lance usually consisted of three parts: a wooden shaft, a bone ring or belt, and the compound head that was made with a barbed bonehead and a stone tip. The length of the compound head was equivalent to the distance between the planes of a man‚Äôs chest to his back. The lance would penetrate the chest and pass through the chest cavity and exit from the back. The bone ring was designed to break after impact so that the shaft could be used again for another kill.&lt;ref name=&quot;AIA&quot;/&gt;

== Language ==
While [[English language|English]] and [[Russian language|Russian]] are the dominant languages used by Aleuts living in the US and Russia respectively, the [[Aleut language]] is still spoken by several hundred people.  The language belongs to the [[Eskimo-Aleut language]] family and includes three dialect groupings: Eastern Aleut, spoken on the Eastern Aleutian, [[Shumagin Islands|Shumagin]], [[Fox Islands (Alaska)|Fox]] and [[Pribilof Islands|Pribilof]] islands; [[Atkan]], spoken on [[Atka Island|Atka]] and [[Bering Island|Bering]] islands; and the now extinct [[Attu Island|Attu]]an dialect.  The Pribilof Islands boast the highest number of active speakers of Aleutian.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act''', commonly abbreviated '''ANCSA''', was signed into law by President [[Richard M. Nixon]] on December 23, 1971, the largest land claims settlement in United States history. ANCSA was intended to resolve the long-standing issues surrounding aboriginal land claims in Alaska, as well as to stimulate economic development throughout [[Alaska]]. The settlement extinguished [[Alaska Native]] claims to the land by transferring titles to twelve [[Alaska Native Regional Corporations|Alaska Native regional corporations]] and over 200 local village corporations. A thirteenth regional corporation was later created for Alaska Natives who no longer resided in [[Alaska]].

==Background==
In 1968, the [[ARCO|Atlantic-Richfield Company]] discovered oil at [[Prudhoe Bay Oil Field|Prudhoe Bay]] on the [[Arctic Ocean|Arctic]] coast, catapulting the issue of [[land ownership]] into headlines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Coile | first = Zachery | publisher=  San Francisco Chronicle | url= http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2005/08/29/MNGLGEEKSF1.DTL | title = ARCTIC OIL: Oil is the lifeblood of Alaska, with residents ready to drill | date = August 9, 2005 | accessdate= 2005-09-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to lessen the difficulty of drilling at such a remote location and transporting the oil to the [[lower 48 states]], the best solution seemed to be building a pipeline to carry the oil across Alaska to the port of [[Valdez, Alaska|Valdez]], built on the ruins of the previous town. At Valdez, the oil would be loaded onto tanker ships and sent by water to the contiguous states. The plan was approved, but a permit to construct the pipeline, which would cross lands involved in the native dispute, could not be granted until the Native claims had been settled.

With major petroleum dollars on the line, there was a new urgency for an agreement, and, in 1971, the ''Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act'' was signed into law by President Nixon, which abrogated Native claims to aboriginal lands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act | publisher = U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service | url= http://laws.fws.gov/lawsdigest/alasnat.html | accessdate= 2005-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In return, they received up to 44 million acres (180,000&amp;nbsp;km¬≤) of land and were paid $963 million. The land and money were divided among regional, urban, and village corporations. The settlement compensated the Natives for the collaborative use of their lands and opened the way for all Alaskans to profit from oil, one of the state's largest natural resources.

==Effect of Land Conveyances==
ANCSA and related legislation produced changes in ownership of about {{convert|148500000|acre|km2}} of land in Alaska once controlled by the Federal Government. That is larger by {{convert|6000000|acre|km2}} than the combined areas of [[Maine]], [[Vermont]], [[New Hampshire]], [[Massachusetts]], [[Rhode Island]], [[Connecticut]], [[New York]], [[New Jersey]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[Delaware]], [[Maryland]] and [[Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Areas As Vast As Whole States Now Change Hands In Alaska |publisher=[[New York Times]] |date=October 8, 1982 |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D05E3DA163BF93BA35753C1A964948260&amp;scp=15&amp;sq=Alaska%20native%20corporations&amp;st=cse}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Selected provisions of ANCSA==
* [[Alaska Native|Native]] claims to almost all of Alaska were extinguished in exchange for approximately one-ninth of the state's land plus $962.5 million in compensation distributed to 200 local village and 12 [[Alaska Native Regional Corporations|Native-owned regional corporations]], plus a thirteenth corporation comprising Alaska Natives who had left the state.
* Of the compensation monies, $462.5 million was to come from the federal treasury and the rest from oil revenue-sharing.
* Settlement benefits would accrue to those with at least one-fourth Native ancestry.
* Of the approximately 80,000 Natives enrolled under ANCSA, those living in villages (approximately 2/3s of the total) would receive 100 shares in both a village and a regional corporation.
* The remaining 1/3 would be &quot;at large&quot; shareholders with 100 shares in a [[The 13th Regional Corporation|regional corporation]] plus additional rights to revenue from regional mineral and timber resources.
* The [[Alaska Native Allotment Act]] was revoked and as yet unborn Native children were excluded.
* The twelve regional corporations within the state would administer the settlement.
* A [[The 13th Regional Corporation|thirteenth corporation]] composed of Natives who had left the state would receive compensation but not land.
* Surface rights to 44 million acres (178,000&amp;nbsp;km¬≤) were patented to the Native village and regional corporations
* The surface rights to the patented land were granted to the village corporations and the subsurface right to the land were granted to the regional corporation, creating a &quot;[[split estate]]&quot;

===Alaska Native regional corporations===
[[Image:ANCSA Regional Corporations Map.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Regional corporations established by the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act.]]
:''Main article at: [[Alaska Native Regional Corporations]]''
The following thirteen regional corporations were created under ANCSA:
* [[Ahtna, Incorporated]]
* [[The Aleut Corporation]] (TAC)
* [[Arctic Slope Regional Corporation]] (ASRC)
* [[Bering Straits Native Corporation]] (BSNC)
* [[Bristol Bay Native Corporation]] (BBNC)
* [[Calista Corporation]]
* [[Chugach Alaska Corporation]] (CAC)

* [[Doyon, Limited]]
* [[Koniag, Incorporated]]
* [[NANA Regional Corporation]] (NANA)
* [[Sealaska Corporation]]
* [[The 13th Regional Corporation]]

Also, most of these corporations set up nonprofit corporations of their own.

===Alaska Native village corporations===
ANCSA created about 200 separate &quot;village corporations.&quot; Below is a short list of some of the village corporations created under ANCSA:
* [http://www.ukpik.com/ Ukpeagvik I√±upiat Corporation] the village corporation for [[Barrow, Alaska]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Baptism-of-Christ-xx-Francesco-Alban.JPG|thumb|300px|[[Francesco Albani]]'s  ''The Baptism of Christ,''  when Jesus became one with God according to Adoptionism ]]

'''Adoptionism''', sometimes called dynamic [[monarchianism]],  is a minority Christian belief that Jesus was adopted as God's son ([[Son of God]]) at his [[Baptism of Jesus|baptism]]. According to [[Epiphanius of Salamis|Epiphanius]]'s account of the [[Ebionites]]&lt;ref&gt;&quot;They too accept  Matthew's gospel, and like the followers of Cerinthus and Merinthus, they use it alone. They call it the ''Gospel of the Hebrews'', for in truth Matthew alone in the New Testament expounded and declared the ''Gospel in Hebrew'' using Hebrew script. After saying many things, this Gospel continues: ‚ÄúAfter the people were baptized, Jesus also came and was baptized by John. And as Jesus came up from the water, Heaven was opened, and He saw the Holy Spirit descend in the form of a dove and enter into Him. And a voice from Heaven said, ‚ÄòYou are my beloved Son; with You I am well pleased.‚Äô And again, ‚ÄòToday I have begotten You.‚Äô  ‚ÄúImmediately a great light shone around the place; and John, seeing it, said to Him, ‚ÄòWho are you, Lord?  And again a voice from Heaven said, ‚ÄòThis is my beloved Son, with whom I am well  pleased.‚Äô Then John, falling down before Him, said, ‚ÄòI beseech You, Lord, baptize me!‚Äô But He forbade him saying, ‚ÄòLet it be so; for thus it is fitting that all things be fulfilled.‚Äô‚Äù  Epiphanius, ''Panarion'' 30:3 &amp; 30:13&lt;/ref&gt;, the group believed that Jesus was chosen because of his sinless devotion to the will of God.

Adoptionism  was  declared heresy at the end of the 2nd century, and was rejected by the [[First Council of Nicaea]], which held to the orthodox doctrine of the Trinity, identifying [[Nicene Creed|Jesus as eternally begotten of God]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Jesus was either regarded as the man whom God had chosen, in whom the Deity or the Spirit of God dwelt, and who, after being tested, was adopted by God and invested with dominion, (Adoptian Christology); or Jesus was regarded as a heavenly spiritual being (the highest after God) who took flesh, and again returned to heaven after the completion of his work on earth (pneumatic Christology).&quot; [[Adolf von Harnack]], History of Dogma [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/harnack/dogma1.ii.iii.iii.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars see Adoptionist concepts in the [[Gospel of Mark]] and in the writings of the [[Apostle Paul]]. According to this view, though Mark has Jesus as the Son of God, occurring at the strategic points of 1:1 (&quot;The beginning of the gospel about Jesus Christ, the Son of God&quot;, but not in all versions, see [[Mark 1]]) and 15:39 (&quot;Surely this man was the Son of God!&quot;), but the Virgin Birth of Jesus has not been developed.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce M. Metzger, ''A Textual Commentary on the Greek New Testament'' (New York : United Bible Societies, 1994). Mark 1:1.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;Ben Witherington III, ''What Have They Done With Jesus?'' (San Francisco: Harper Collins, 2006), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; By the time the Gospels of [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] and [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] were written, Jesus is portrayed as being the Son of God from the time of birth, and finally the [[Gospel of John]] portrays the [[Logos (Christianity)|Son as existing &quot;in the beginning&quot;]].

==History==
===Early Primary Writings ===

In ''The Orthodox Corruption of Scripture'',  author and text critic [[Bart D. Ehrman]] argues that the ''Adoptionist Theology'' may date back almost to the [[Cultural and historical background of Jesus|time of Jesus]] and his view is shared by many other scholars{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}. The first leader of the Church was [[James the Just]] who succeeded [[Desposyni|his brother]] [[Jesus of Nazareth]].
&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.ca/books?id=uqzY1zBtKg0C&amp;pg=PA7&amp;lpg=PA7&amp;dq=just+mary+john+%22II.James,the+brother+of+the+lord%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=MRj_si8g__&amp;sig=uur0espW-RiEsfBmaVC4KRCZDuk&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=TBTGSsm3A4HU8QbJzL1G&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1#v=onepage&amp;q=just%20mary%20john%20%22II.James%2Cthe%20brother%20of%20the%20lord%22&amp;f=false Jerome, Illustrious Men 3]&lt;/ref&gt; They were located in and about [[Jerusalem in Christianity|Jerusalem]], perhaps in the [[Cenacle]], and proclaimed that  Jesus was the promised  [[Messiah]]. These early [[Jewish Christians]] were thought to have been called [[Nazarenes]]. The term Nazarene was first applied to Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;''Gospel of Matthew'' 2:23&lt;/ref&gt;  and later to the Jewish Sect that believed Jesus was the Messiah.&lt;ref&gt;F.L. Cross and E.A. Livingston, ''The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church,'' Oxford University Press, (1988-92) p. 597&amp;722.&lt;/ref&gt; It is close to an historical certainty that Matthew belonged to this group.&lt;ref&gt;Both the [[Gospels]] (pro-Christian and seen by some as [[anti-Judaism]]) and the early [[Talmud]] (part of [[Judaism]] and seen by some as [[anti-Christian]]) affirm this to be true. [[Bernhard Pick]]  ''The Talmud: What It Is and What It Knows of Jesus and His Followers'',  BiblioBazaar, LLC, 2009 116&lt;/ref&gt;
Some believe that the [[Gospel of the Hebrews]] or the ''Gospel of the Apostles'' &lt;ref&gt;Eusebius ''Church History'' 3:39 .&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Origen]] explains, &quot;The very first account to be written was by Matthew, once a tax collector, but later an [[Apostle (Christian)|apostle]] of Jesus Christ.  Matthew published it for the converts from Judaism and composed it in Hebrew letters.&quot; [[Church History (Eusebius)|Eusebius ''Church History,'']] 6:25 Eusebius adds insight by explaining that the apostles &quot;were led to write only under the pressure of necessity.  Matthew, who had first preached the Gospel in Hebrew, when on the point of going to other nations, committed the gospel to writing in his native language.  Therefore he supplied the written word to make up for the lack of his own presence to those from whom he was sent.&quot;  Eusebius ''Church History,'' 3:24&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;Irenaeus gives us further insight into the date and circumstances of this gospel by explaining, &quot;Matthew also issued a written ''Gospel of the Hebrews'' in their own language while Peter and Paul were preaching at Rome and laying the foundations of the Church.&quot; Irenaeus, ''Against Heresies,'' 3:1&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;Matthew, the tax collector and later an Apostle, composed his gospel near Jerusalem for Hebrew Christians. It was then translated into Greek but the Greek copy was lost. The Hebrew original was preserved at the Library of Caesarea, which Pamphilus diligently gathered. The Nazarenes transcribed a copy for Jerome which he used in his work.

was an early account of the [[Ministry of Jesus|life and teachings of Jesus]], written by a person named Matthew.&lt;ref&gt;Bernhard Pick, ''The Talmud: What It Is and What It Knows of Jesus and His Followers'', Kessinger Publishing, 2006  pp. 122, 125-129&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Church Fathers]], he was the same person as the [[Apostle Matthew]]. No copies exist: what is known about this book is from quotes, including by that of the church leader Papias ca. 125. As recorded in [[Epiphanius of Salamis|Epiphanius]]'s account, when Jesus is baptized it states, &quot;Jesus came up from the water, Heaven was opened, and He saw the Holy Spirit descend in the form of a dove and enter into Him. And a voice from Heaven said, ‚ÄòYou are my beloved Son; with You I am well pleased.‚Äô And again, ''‚ÄòToday I have begotten You.‚Äô''  Immediately a great light shone around the place&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Epiphanius, ''Panarion'' 30:13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James R.

The ''Gospel of Mark''  is believed by many [[higher criticism|modern-critical]] scholars to have been composed around or shortly after the [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|fall of Jerusalem]], and near universal, scholarly consensus holds that it was the first [[Canonical Gospel]] written.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Crossan | first = John Dominic | authorlink = John_Dominic_Crossan | coauthors = | title = The historical Jesus: the life of a Mediterranean Jewish peasant | publisher = HarperSanFrancisco | year = 1991 | location = San Francisco, California | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-06-061629-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Eisenman | first = Robert H. | authorlink = Robert_Eisenman | coauthors = | title = [[James the Brother of Jesus: The Key to Unlocking the Secrets of Early Christianity and the Dead Sea Scrolls]] | publisher = Penguin Books | year = 1998 | location = | page = 56 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-14-025773-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Robinson, ''Redating the New Testament'', 1976, Wipf &amp; Stock Publishers: ISBN 1-57910-527-0. p.352&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;brown164&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;brown164&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Brown |first=Raymond E. |authorlink=Raymond E.

Paul's writings do not mention a Virgin birth of Christ, and some contend that Paul had never heard of it{{Who|date=February 2011}}. Paul wrote that Jesus was &quot;born of a woman, born under the law&quot; and &quot;as to his human nature was a descendant of David&quot; in the [[Epistle to the Galatians]] and  the [[Epistle to the Romans]]. The [[Epistle to the Hebrews]] states &lt;ref&gt;http://net.bible.org/verse.php?book=heb&amp;chapter=1&amp;verse=5&lt;/ref&gt; that God said &quot;You are my son. ''Today I have begotten you&quot;'', a phrase that shows adoptionist tendencies and no specific reference to the Virgin Birth.  It is also almost a direct quote from the second [[Psalm]].

=== Later Secondary Documents ===
The ''Gospels of Matthew'' and ''Luke'' were written several years after Paul.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/index.html Dating, Early Christian Writings]&lt;/ref&gt; The authors composed their gospels based on earlier Christian documents such as the ''Gospel of Mark''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/matthew.html ''Gospel of Matthew'', Early Christian Writings]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/luke.html ''Gospel of Luke'', Early Christian Writings]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2nd century, adoptionism was one of two competing doctrines about the nature of Jesus Christ, the other (as in the [[Gospel of John]]) being that he pre-existed as a divine spirit ([[Logos]]).&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Jesus was either regarded as the man whom God hath chosen, in whom the Deity or the Spirit of God dwelt, and who, after being tested, was adopted by God and invested with dominion, (Adoptian Christology); or Jesus was regarded as a heavenly spiritual being (the highest after God) who took flesh, and again returned to heaven after the completion of his work on earth (pneumatic Christology).&quot; [[Adolf von Harnack]], History of Dogma [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/harnack/dogma1.ii.iii.iii.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, there were three waves of Adoptionist speculation if we exclude the hypothetical beliefs of the primitive church that cannot be determined with certainty. The first, which dates from the 2nd century, differs significantly from the subsequent two (dating respectively from the 8th and the 12th century), which follow the definition of the dogma of the Trinity and Chalcedonian Christology.

==Adoptionism and Christology==
Adoptionism is one of two main forms of [[monarchianism]] (the other is [[modalism]], which regards &quot;Father&quot; and &quot;Son&quot; as two aspects of the same subject). Adoptionism (also known as [[dynamic monarchianism]]) denies the pre-existence of Christ and although it does not deny his deity many Trinitarians claim that it does.  Under Adoptionism Jesus is currently divine and has been since his adoption, although he is not equal to the Father.

Adoptionism was one position in a long series of Christian disagreements about the precise nature of Christ (see [[Christology]]) in the developing dogma of the [[Trinity]], an attempt to explain the relationship between Jesus of Nazareth, both as man and (now) God, and God the Father while identifying as [[monotheistic]]. It differs significantly from the doctrine of the Trinity that was later affirmed by the [[ecumenical council]]s.

===Second century: ante-Nicene Christology===
The first known exponent of Adoptionism in the 2nd century is [[Theodotus of Byzantium]]. He taught&lt;ref&gt;[[Hippolytus of Rome]], ''[[Philosophumena]]'', VII, xxxv.&lt;/ref&gt; that Jesus was a man born of a virgin according to the Council of Jerusalem, that he lived like other men, and was most pious; but that at his baptism in the Jordan the Christ came down upon the man Jesus in the likeness of a dove. Therefore wonders (''dynameis'') were not wrought in him until the Spirit (which Theodotus called Christ) came down and was manifested in Him.{{Or|date=May 2011}} The belief was declared heretical by [[Pope Victor I]].

The 2nd-century work [[Shepherd of Hermas]] also taught that Jesus was a virtuous man filled with the Holy Spirit and adopted as the Son.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Holy Pre-existent Spirit. Which created the whole creation, God made to dwell in flesh that he desired. This flesh, therefore, in which the Holy Spirit dwelt, was subject unto the Spirit, walking honorably in holiness and purity, without in any way defiling the Spirit. When then it had lived honorably in chastity, and had labored with the Spirit, and had cooperated with it in everything, behaving itself boldly and bravely, he chose it as a partner with the Holy Spirit; for the career of this flesh pleased [the Lord], seeing that, as possessing the Holy Spirit, it was not defiled upon the earth. He therefore took the son as adviser and the glorious angels also, that this flesh too, having served the Spirit unblamably, might have some place of sojourn, and might not seem to have lost the reward for its service; for all flesh, which is found undefiled and unspotted, wherein the Holy Spirit dwelt, shall receive a reward.&quot; [http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/shepherd-lightfoot.html]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Or|date=May 2011}} While the Shepherd of Hermas was popular and sometimes bound with the canonical scriptures, it didn't retain canonical status, if it ever had it.

In the 3rd century, [[Paul of Samosata]], [[Patriarch of Antioch]], promoted adoptionism. He said Jesus had been a man who kept himself sinless and achieved union with God. His views, however, did not neatly fit in either of the two main forms of Monarchianism.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}&lt;!--why not?--&gt;

==Medieval and Modern Adoptionism==
===Spanish Adoptionism===
[[Spanish Adoptionism]] was a theological position which was articulated in [[Caliphate_of_C√≥rdoba|Umayyad]] and [[Kingdom_of_Asturias|Christian]]-held regions of the [[Iberian peninsula]] in the [[8th century|eighth]]- and [[9th century|ninth]] centuries. The issue seems to have begun with the claim of archbishop [[Elipandus of Toledo]] that ‚Äì in respect to his human nature ‚Äì Christ was ''adoptive'' [[Son of God]]. Another leading advocate of this Christology was [[Felix of Urgel]]. In Spain, Adoptionism was opposed by [[Beatus of Liebana]], and in the [[Carolingian]] territories, the Adoptionist position was condemned by [[Pope Hadrian I]], [[Alcuin of York]], [[Agobard]], and officially in Carolingian territory by the Council of Frankfurt (794). &lt;br /&gt;

Despite the shared name of &quot;Adoptionism&quot; the Spanish Adoptionist Christology appears to have differed sharply from the Adoptionism of early Christianity. Spanish advocates predicated the term ''adoptivus'' of Christ only in respect to his humanity; once the divine Son &quot;emptied himself&quot; of divinity  and &quot;took the form of a servant&quot; (Philippians 2:7), Christ's human nature was &quot;adopted&quot; as divine.&lt;ref&gt;James Ginther, ''Westminster Handbook to Medieval Theology'', (Louisville, KY: Westminster John Knox Press, 2009), 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, many scholars have followed the Adoptionists' Carolingian opponents in labeling Spanish Adoptionism as a minor revival of ‚ÄúNestorian‚Äù Christology.&lt;ref&gt;For an example of this characterization, see Adolph Harnack, ‚Äò‚ÄôHistory of Dogma‚Äô‚Äô, vol. 5, trans. Neil Buchanan, (New York: Dover, 1961), 280.&lt;/ref&gt; John C. Cavadini has challenged this notion by attempting to take the Spanish Christology in its own Spanish/North African context in his important study, ''The Last Christology of the West: Adoptionism in Spain and Gaul, 785-820''.&lt;ref&gt;John C. Cavadini, ‚Äò‚ÄôThe Last Christology of the West: Adoptionism in Spain and Gaul, 785-820‚Äô‚Äô, (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1993), 4-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

===12th century and later: Neo-adoptionism===
A third wave was the revived form (&quot;Neo-Adoptionism&quot;) of [[Peter Abelard]] in the 12th century. Later, various modified and qualified adoptionist tenets emerged from some theologians in the 14th century. [[Duns Scotus]] (1300) and [[Durandus of Saint-Pour√ßain]] (1320) admit the term ''Filius adoptivus'' in a qualified sense. In more recent times the Jesuit [[Gabriel V√°squez]], and the Lutheran divines [[Georgius Calixtus]] and [[Johann Ernst Immanuel Walch]], have defended adoptionism as essentially orthodox.

===19th century, Psilanthropism===
A form of adoptionism surfaced in [[Unitarianism]] during the 18th as the [[Virgin birth of Jesus|virgin birth]] was increasingly denied by Unitarians {{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}. In the 19th century the term  [[Psilanthropism]], was applied by such as [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] who so called his own view that Jesus was the son of Joseph.&lt;ref&gt;Cyclop√¶dia of Biblical, theological, and ecclesiastical literature, Volume 2 By John McClintock, James Strong&lt;/ref&gt;)

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Apollinarism''' or '''Apollinarianism''' was a view proposed by [[Apollinaris of Laodicea]] (died [[390]]) that [[Jesus]] could not have had a human mind; rather, that Jesus Christ had a [[human]] body and lower soul (the seat of the emotions) but a [[God|divine]] mind. 

The [[Trinity]] had been recognized at the Council of Nicea in [[325]], but debate about exactly what it meant continued. A rival to the more common belief that Jesus Christ had two natures was [[monophysitism]] (&quot;one nature&quot;), the doctrine that Christ had only one nature. Apollinarism and [[Eutychianism]] were two forms of monophysitism. Apollinaris' rejection that Christ had a human mind was considered an over-reaction to [[Arianism]] and its teaching that Christ was not divine.&lt;ref&gt;McGrath, Alistair. 1998. ''Historical Theology, An Introduction to the History of Christian Thought.'' Oxford: Blackwell Publishers. Chapter 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Theodoret]] charged Apollinaris with confounding the persons of the [[Godhead (Christianity)|Godhead]], and with giving into the heretical ways of [[Sabellius]]. [[Basil of Caesarea]] accused him of abandoning the literal sense of the scripture, and taking up wholly with the allegorical sense. His views were condemned in a [[Synod]] at [[Alexandria]], under [[Athanasius of Alexandria]], in 362, and later subdivided into several different heresies, the main ones of which were the [[Polemian]]s and the [[Antidicomarianite]]s.

It was declared to be a [[Christian heresy|heresy]] in 381 by the [[First Council of Constantinople]], since Christ was officially depicted as fully human and fully God. Followers of Apollinarianism were accused of attempting to create a [[tertium quid]] (&quot;third thing,&quot; neither God nor man).

Apollinaris further taught, following [[Tertullian]], that the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]]s of men were propagated by other souls, as well as their bodies (see [[traducianism]]). {{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Acids and Bases}}
An '''acid‚Äìbase reaction''' is a [[chemical reaction]] that occurs between an [[acid]] and a [[base (chemistry)|base]]. Several concepts that provide alternative definitions for the reaction mechanisms involved and their application in solving related problems exist. Despite several differences in definitions, their importance becomes apparent as different methods of analysis when applied to acid‚Äìbase reactions for gaseous or liquid species, or when acid or base character may be somewhat less apparent. The first of these scientific concepts of acids and bases was provided by the [[France|French]] [[chemist]] [[Antoine Lavoisier]], circa 1776.&lt;ref name=&quot;lavoisier_1&quot;&gt;Miessler, L. M., Tar, D. A., (1991) p. 166 ‚Äì Table of discoveries attributes Antoine Lavoisier as the first to posit a scientific theory in relation to [[oxyacid]]s.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historic acid‚Äìbase theories==
=== Lavoisier's oxygen theory of acids ===
The first scientific concept of acids and bases was provided by [[Antoine Lavoisier]] circa 1776. Since Lavoisier's knowledge of [[strong acids]] was mainly restricted to [[oxoacid]]s, such as {{chem|link=nitric acid|HNO|3|}} (nitric acid) and {{chem|link=sulfuric acid|H|2|SO|4}} (sulfuric acid), which tend to contain central atoms in high [[oxidation number|oxidation states]] surrounded by oxygen, and since he was not aware of the true composition of the [[hydrogen halide|hydrohalic acids]] ([[Hydrogen fluoride|HF]], [[Hydrogen chloride|HCl]], [[Hydrogen bromide|HBr]], and [[Hydrogen iodide|HI]]), he defined acids in terms of their containing ''[[oxygen]]'', which in fact he named from Greek words meaning &quot;acid-former&quot; (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ŒøŒæœÖœÇ (''oxys'') meaning &quot;acid&quot; or &quot;sharp&quot; and Œ≥ŒµŒπŒΩŒøŒºŒ±Œπ (''geinomai'') meaning &quot;engender&quot;). The Lavoisier definition was held as absolute truth for over 30 years, until the 1810 article and subsequent lectures by [[Humphry Davy|Sir Humphry Davy]] in which he proved the lack of oxygen in [[hydrogen sulfide|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S]], [[hydrogen telluride|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te]], and the [[hydrogen halide|hydrohalic acids]]. However, Davy failed to develop a new theory, concluding that &quot;acidity does not depend upon any particular elementary substance, but upon peculiar arrangement of various substances&quot;.&lt;ref name=review1940&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Systems of Acids and Bases|last=Hall|first=Norris F.|journal=J. Chem. Educ.|date=March 1940|volume=17|issue=3|doi=10.1021/ed017p124|pages=124‚Äì128}}&lt;/ref&gt; One notable modification of oxygen theory was provided by [[Berzelius]], who stated that acids are oxides of nonmetals while bases are oxides of metals.

===Liebig's hydrogen theory of acids===
This definition was proposed by [[Justus von Liebig]] circa 1838,&lt;ref name=&quot;liebig_1&quot;&gt;Miessler, L. M., Tar, D. A., (1991) &quot;''Inorganic Chemistry''&quot; 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; ed. Pearson Prentice-Hall p. 166 ‚Äì table of discoveries attributes Justus von Liebig's publication as 1838&lt;/ref&gt; based on his extensive works on the chemical composition of [[organic acid]]s. This finished the doctrinal shift from oxygen-based acids to hydrogen-based acids, started by Davy. According to Liebig, an acid is a hydrogen-containing substance in which the hydrogen could be replaced by a metal.&lt;ref name=meyers_156&gt;{{Cite book|author=Meyers, R.|year=2003|title=The Basics of Chemistry|publisher=Greenwood Press|page=156}}&lt;/ref&gt; Liebig's definition, while completely empirical, remained in use for almost 50 years until the adoption of the Arrhenius definition.&lt;ref name=&quot;liebig_2&quot;&gt;H.

==Common acid‚Äìbase theories==
=== Arrhenius definition ===
[[File:Arrhenius2.jpg|thumb|right|Svante Arrhenius]]
The Arrhenius definition of acid‚Äìbase reactions is a development of the hydrogen theory of acids, devised by [[Svante Arrhenius]], which was used to provide a modern definition of acids and bases that followed from his work with [[Friedrich Wilhelm Ostwald]] in establishing the presence of ions in [[aqueous solution]] in 1884, and led to Arrhenius receiving the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] in 1903 for &quot;recognition of the extraordinary services... rendered to the advancement of chemistry by his electrolytic theory of dissociation&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;miessler_165&quot;&gt;Miessler, L. M., Tar, D. A., (1991) &quot;''Inorganic Chemistry''&quot; 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; ed. Pearson Prentice-Hall p. 165&lt;/ref&gt;

As defined by Arrhenius, acid‚Äìbase reactions are characterized by Arrhenius acids, which [[dissociation constant|dissociate]] in aqueous solution to form hydrogen ions ({{chem|H|+}}),&lt;ref name=&quot;miessler_165&quot; /&gt; and Arrhenius bases, which form hydroxide ({{chem|OH|‚àí}}) ions. More recent [[IUPAC]] recommendations now suggest the newer term &quot;hydronium&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Murray, K. K., Boyd, R. K., et al. (2006) &quot;''Standard definition of terms relating to mass spectrometry recommendations''&quot; International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry. ‚Äì Please note that, in this document, there is no reference to deprecation of &quot;oxonium&quot;, which is also still accepted as it remains in the IUPAC Gold book, but rather reveals preference for the term &quot;Hydronium&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; be used in favor of the older accepted term &quot;oxonium&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;iupac_gold&quot;&gt;International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (2006) ''IUPAC Compendium of Chemical Terminology, Electronic version'' Retrieved from International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry on 9 May 2007 on URL http://goldbook.iupac.org/O04379.html &quot;''Oxonium Ions''&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; to illustrate reaction mechanisms such as those defined in the Br√∏nsted‚ÄìLowry and solvent system definitions more clearly, with the Arrhenius definition serving as a simple general outline of acid‚Äìbase character.&lt;ref name=&quot;miessler_165&quot; /&gt; The Arrhenius definition can be summarised as &quot;Arrhenius acids form hydrogen ions in aqueous solution with Arrhenius bases forming hydroxide ions.&quot;

The ''universal aqueous acid‚Äìbase definition'' of the Arrhenius concept is described as the formation of water from hydrogen and hydroxide ions, or hydrogen ions and hydroxide ions from the dissociation of an acid and base in aqueous solution:

:{{chem|H|+}} (aq) + {{chem|OH|‚àí}} (aq) {{eqm}} {{chem|H|2|O}}

(In modern times, the use of {{chem|H|+}} is regarded as a shorthand for [[hydronium|{{chem|H|3|O|+}}]], since it is now known that the bare proton {{chem|H|+}} does not exist as a free species in solution.){{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

This leads to the definition that in Arrhenius acid‚Äìbase reactions, a salt and water is formed from the reaction between an acid and a base.&lt;ref name=&quot;miessler_165&quot; /&gt; In other words, this is a [[Neutralization (chemistry)|neutralization reaction]].

:acid&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + base&lt;sup&gt;‚àí&lt;/sup&gt; ‚Üí salt + water

The positive ion from a base forms a salt with the negative ion from an acid. For example, two [[mole (unit)|moles]] of the base [[sodium hydroxide]] (NaOH) can combine with one mole of sulfuric acid ({{chem|H|2|SO|4}}) to form two moles of [[water]] and one mole of [[sodium sulfate]].

:2 NaOH + {{chem|H|2|SO|4}} ‚Üí 2 {{chem|H|2|O}} + {{chem|Na|2|SO|4}}

The Arrhenius definitions of acidity and alkalinity are restricted to [[aqueous solution]]s, and refer to the concentration of the solvent ions. Under this definition, pure {{chem|H|2|SO|4}} or HCl dissolved in toluene are not acidic, and molten KOH and solutions of sodium amide in liquid ammonia are not alkaline.

===Solvent system definition===
One of the limitations of Arrhenius definition was its reliance on water solutions. Edward C. Franklin studied the acid‚Äìbase reactions in liquid ammonia in 1905 and pointed out the similarities to water-based Arrhenius theory, and Albert F. O. Germann, working with liquid {{chem|COCl|2}}, generalized Arrhenius definition to cover aprotic solvents and formulated the solvent system theory in 1925.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=A General Theory of Solvent Systems|journal=J.Am.Chem.Soc.|first=Albert F. O.|last=Germann|date=6 October 1925|volume=47|issue=10|pages=2461‚Äì2468|doi=10.1021/ja01687a006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Germann pointed out that in many solvents there is a certain concentration of a positive species, '''solvonium''' (earlier lyonium) cations and negative species, '''solvate''' (earlier lyate) anions, in equilibrium with the neutral solvent molecules. For example, [[water]] and [[ammonia]] undergo such dissociation into [[hydronium]] and [[hydroxide]], and [[ammonium]] and [[amide]], respectively:

: 2 {{chem|H|2|O}} {{eqm}} {{chem|H|3|O|+}} + {{chem|OH|‚àí}}
: 2 {{chem|NH|3|}} {{eqm}} {{chem|NH|4|+}} + {{chem|NH|2|‚àí}}

Some aprotic systems also undergo such dissociation, such as [[dinitrogen tetroxide]] into [[nitrosonium]] and [[nitrate]], [[antimony trichloride]] into dichloroantimonium and tetrachloroantimonate, and [[phosgene]] into chlorocarboxonium and [[chloride]].

: {{chem|N|2|O|4}} {{eqm}} {{chem|NO|+}} + {{chem|NO|3|‚àí}}
: 2 {{chem|SbCl|3}} {{eqm}} {{chem|SbCl|2|+}} + {{chem|SbCl|4|‚àí}}
: {{chem|COCl|2}} {{eqm}} {{chem|COCl|+}} + {{chem|Cl|‚àí}}
A solute causing an increase in the concentration of the solvonium ions and a decrease in the solvate ions is defined as an acid and one causing the reverse is defined as a base. Thus, in liquid [[ammonia]], {{chem|KNH|2}} (supplying {{chem|NH|2|‚àí}}) is a strong base, and {{chem|NH|4|NO|3}} (supplying {{chem|NH|4|+}}) is a strong acid. In liquid [[sulfur dioxide]] ({{chem|SO|2}}), [[thionyl]] compounds (supplying {{chem|SO|2+}}) behave as acids, and [[sulfites]] (supplying {{chem|SO|3|2‚àí}}) behave as bases.

The non-aqueous acid‚Äìbase reactions in liquid ammonia are similar to the reactions in water:
: 2 {{chem|NaNH|2}} (base) + {{chem|Zn(NH|2|)|2}} ([[amphiphilic]] amide) ‚Üí {{chem|Na|2|[Zn(NH|2|)|4|]}}
: 2 {{chem|NH|4|I}} (acid) + {{chem|Zn(NH|2|)|2}} (amphiphilic amide) ‚Üí {{chem|[Zn(NH|3|)|4|)]I|2}}
Nitric acid can be a base in liquid sulfuric acid:
: {{chem|HNO|3}} (base) + 2 {{chem|H|2|SO|4}} ‚Üí {{chem|NO|2|+}} + {{chem|H|3|O|+}} + 2 {{chem|HSO|4|‚àí}}
The unique strength of this definition shows in describing the reactions in aprotic solvents, for example in liquid {{chem|N|2|O|4}}:
: {{chem|AgNO|3}} (base) + {{chem|NOCl}} (acid) ‚Üí {{chem|N|2|O|4}} (solvent) + {{chem|AgCl}} (salt)

Since solvent-system definition depends on the solvent as well as on the compound itself, the same compound can change its role depending on the choice of the solvent. Thus, {{chem|HClO|4}} is a strong acid in water, a weak acid in acetic acid, and a weak base in fluorosulfonic acid. This was seen as both a strength and a weakness, since some substances, such as {{chem|SO|3}} and {{chem|NH|3}} were felt to be acidic or basic on their own right. On the other hand, solvent system theory was criticized as too general to be useful; it was felt that there was something intrinsically acidic about hydrogen compounds, not shared by non-hydrogenic solvonium salts.&lt;ref name=review1940/&gt;

===Br√∏nsted‚ÄìLowry definition===
{{Main|Br√∏nsted‚ÄìLowry acid‚Äìbase theory}}

The Br√∏nsted‚ÄìLowry definition, formulated in 1923, independently by [[Johannes Nicolaus Br√∏nsted]] in Denmark and [[Martin Lowry]] in England, is based upon the idea of [[protonation]] of bases through the [[deprotonation|de-protonation]] of acids‚Äîthat is, the ability of acids to &quot;donate&quot; hydrogen ions (H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) or [[proton (physics)|protons]] to bases, which &quot;accept&quot; them.&lt;ref name=&quot;miessler_167&quot;&gt;Miessler, L. M., Tar, D. A., (1991) &quot;''Inorganic Chemistry''&quot; 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; ed. Pearson Prentice-Hall pp. 167‚Äì169 ‚Äì According to this page, the original definition was that &quot;acids have a tendency to lose a proton&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the previous definitions, the Br√∏nsted‚ÄìLowry definition does not refer to the formation of salt and solvent, but instead to the formation of ''conjugate acids'' and ''conjugate bases'', produced by the transfer of a proton from the acid to the base.&lt;ref name=&quot;miessler_165&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;miessler_167&quot; /&gt; In this approach, acids and bases are fundamentally different in behavior from salts, which are seen as electrolytes, subject to the theories of [[Peter Debye|Debye]], [[Lars Onsager|Onsager]], and others. An acid and a base react not to produce a salt and a solvent, but to form a new acid and a new base. The concept of [[Neutralization (chemistry)|neutralization]] is thus absent.&lt;ref name=review1940/&gt;

According to Br√∏nsted‚ÄìLowry definition, an ''acid'' is a compound that can donate a proton, and a ''base'' is a compound that can receive a proton. An acid‚Äìbase reaction is, thus, the removal of a hydrogen ion from the acid and its addition to the base.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clayden_1&quot;&gt;Clayden, J., Warren, S., et al. (2000) &quot;''Organic Chemistry''&quot; Oxford University Press pp. 182‚Äì184&lt;/ref&gt; This does not refer to the removal of a proton from the nucleus of an atom, which would require levels of energy not attainable through the simple dissociation of acids, but to removal of a hydrogen ion ({{chem|H|+}}).

The removal of a proton (hydrogen ion) from an acid produces its ''conjugate base'', which is the acid with a hydrogen ion removed, and the reception of a proton by a base produces its ''conjugate acid'', which is the base with a hydrogen ion added.

For example, the removal of {{chem|H|+}} from [[hydrochloric acid]] (HCl) produces the chloride ion ({{chem|Cl|‚àí}}), the conjugate base of the acid:

:{{chem|HCl}} ‚Üí {{chem|H|+}} + {{chem|Cl|‚àí}}

The addition of {{chem|H|+}} to the hydroxide ion ({{chem|OH|‚àí}}), a base, produces water ({{chem|H|2|O}}), its conjugate acid:

:{{chem|H|+}} + {{chem|OH|‚àí}} ‚Üí {{chem|H|2|O}}

Although Br√∏nsted‚ÄìLowry acid‚Äìbase behavior is formally independent of any solvent, it encompasses Arrhenius and solvent system definitions in an unenforced way. For example, protonation of [[ammonia]], a base, gives [[ammonium ion]], its conjugate acid:
:{{chem|H|+}} + {{chem|NH|3}} ‚Üí {{chem|NH|4|+}}

The reaction of ammonia, a base, with [[acetic acid]] in absence of water can be described to give ammonium cation, an acid, and acetate anion, a base:

:{{chem|CH|3|COOH}} + {{chem|NH|3}} ‚Üí {{chem|NH|4|+}} + {{chem|CH|3|COO|‚àí}}

This definition also explains the dissociation of water into low concentrations of hydronium and hydroxide ions:

:{{chem|H|2|O}} + {{chem|H|2|O}} {{eqm}} {{chem|H|3|O|+}} + {{chem|OH|‚àí}}

Water, being [[amphoteric]], can act as both an acid and a base; here, one molecule of water acts as an acid, donating a {{chem|H|+}} ion and forming the conjugate base, {{chem|OH|‚àí}}, and a second molecule of water acts as a base, accepting the {{chem|H|+}} ion and forming the conjugate acid, {{chem|H|3|O|+}}.

Acid dissociation and acid hydrolysis are seen to be entirely similar phenomena:

: HCl (acid) + {{chem|H|2|O}} (base) {{eqm}} {{chem|H|3|O|+}} (acid) + {{chem|Cl|‚àí}} (base)
: {{chem|NH|4|+}} (acid) + {{chem|H|2|O}} (base) {{eqm}} {{chem|H|3|O|+}} (acid) + {{chem|NH|3}} (base)

as are basic dissociation and basic hydrolysis:

: {{chem|NH|3}} (base) + {{chem|H|2|O}} (acid) {{eqm}} {{chem|NH|4|+}} (acid) + {{chem|OH|‚àí}} (base)
: {{chem|CH|3|COO|‚àí}} (base) + {{chem|H|2|O}} (acid) {{eqm}} {{chem|CH|3|COOH}} (acid) + {{chem|OH|‚àí}} (base)

[[File:Bronsted-lowry-3d-explanation-diagram.png|600px|center]]

Thus, the general formula for acid‚Äìbase reactions according to the Br√∏nsted‚ÄìLowry definition is:

:AH + B ‚Üí {{chem|BH|+}} + {{chem|A|‚àí}}

where AH represents the acid, B represents the base, {{chem|BH|+}} represents the conjugate acid of B, and {{chem|A|‚àí}} represents the conjugate base of AH.

Although Br√∏nsted‚ÄìLowry calls hydrogen-containing substances like {{chem|HCl}} acids, {{chem|KOH}} and {{chem|KNH|2}} are not bases but salts containing the bases {{chem|OH|‚àí}} and {{chem|NH|2|‚àí}}. Also, some substances, which many chemists considered to be acids, such as {{chem|SO|3}} or {{chem|BCl|3}}, are excluded from this classification due to lack of hydrogen. Gilbert Lewis wrote in 1938, &quot;To restrict the group of acids to those substances which contain hydrogen interferes as seriously with the systematic understanding of chemistry as would the restriction of the term oxidizing agent to substances containing oxygen.&quot;&lt;ref name=review1940/&gt;

===Lewis definition===
{{See|Lewis acids and bases}}
The hydrogen requirement of Arrhenius and Br√∏nsted‚ÄìLowry was removed by the Lewis definition of acid‚Äìbase reactions, devised by [[Gilbert N. Lewis]] in 1923,&lt;ref name=&quot;lewis_1&quot;&gt;Miessler, L. M., Tar, D. A., (1991) &quot;''Inorganic Chemistry''&quot; 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; ed. Pearson Prentice-Hall p. 166 ‚Äì Table of discoveries attributes the date of publication/release for the Lewis theory as 1923.&lt;/ref&gt; in the same year as Br√∏nsted‚ÄìLowry, but it was not elaborated by him until 1938.&lt;ref name=review1940/&gt; Instead of defining acid‚Äìbase reactions in terms of protons or other bonded substances, the Lewis definition defines a base (referred to as a ''Lewis base'') to be a compound that can donate an ''[[electron pair]]'', and an acid (a ''Lewis acid'') to be a compound that can receive this electron pair.&lt;ref name=&quot;lewis_2&quot;&gt;Miessler, L. M., Tar, D. A., (1991) &quot;''Inorganic Chemistry''&quot; 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; ed. Pearson Prentice-Hall pp. 170‚Äì172&lt;/ref&gt;

In this system, an acid does not exchange atoms with a base, but combines with it. For example, consider this classical aqueous acid‚Äìbase reaction:

:{{chem|HCl}} (aq) + {{chem|NaOH}} (aq) ‚Üí {{chem|H|2|O}} (l) + {{chem|NaCl}} (aq)

The Lewis definition does not regard this reaction as the formation of salt and water or the transfer of {{chem|H|+}} from HCl to {{chem|OH|‚àí}}. Instead, it regards the acid to be the {{chem|H|+}} ion itself, and the base to be the {{chem|OH|‚àí}} ion, which has an unshared electron pair. Therefore, the acid‚Äìbase reaction here, according to the Lewis definition, is the donation of the electron pair from {{chem|OH|‚àí}} to the {{chem|H|+}} ion. This forms a covalent bond between {{chem|H|+}} and {{chem|OH|‚àí}}, thus producing water ({{chem|H|2|O}}).

By treating acid‚Äìbase reactions in terms of electron pairs instead of specific substances, the Lewis definition can be applied to reactions that do not fall under other definitions of acid‚Äìbase reactions. For example, a [[silver]] cation behaves as an acid with respect to [[ammonia]], which behaves as a base, in the following reaction:

: {{chem|Ag|+}} + 2 :{{chem|NH|3}} ‚Üí {{chem|[H|3|N}}:Ag:{{chem|NH|3|]|+}}

The result of this reaction is the formation of an ammonia‚Äìsilver [[adduct]].

In reactions between [[Lewis acid]]s and [[Lewis base|bases]], there is the formation of an adduct&lt;ref name=&quot;lewis_2&quot; /&gt; when the highest occupied molecular orbital ([[HOMO]]) of a molecule, such as {{chem|NH|3}} with available lone electron pair(s) donates lone pairs of electrons to the electron-deficient molecule's lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ([[LUMO]]) through a [[co-ordinate covalent bond]]; in such a reaction, the HOMO-interacting molecule acts as a base, and the LUMO-interacting molecule acts as an acid.&lt;ref name=&quot;lewis_2&quot; /&gt; In highly-polar molecules, such as [[boron trifluoride]] ({{chem|BF|3}}),&lt;ref name=&quot;lewis_2&quot; /&gt; the most [[electronegativity|electronegative]] element pulls electrons towards its own orbitals, providing a more positive charge on the less-electronegative element and a difference in its electronic structure due to the axial or equatorial orbiting positions of its electrons, causing repulsive effects from ''lone pair ‚Äì bonding pair'' (Lp‚ÄìBp) interactions between bonded atoms in excess of those already provided by ''bonding pair ‚Äì bonding pair'' (Bp‚ÄìBp) interactions.&lt;ref name=&quot;lewis_2&quot; /&gt; Adducts involving metal ions are referred to as co-ordination compounds.&lt;ref name=&quot;lewis_2&quot; /&gt;

==Other acid‚Äìbase theories==
=== Usanovich definition ===
Simultaneously with Lewis, a Soviet chemist [[Mikhail Usanovich]] from Tashkent, developed a general theory that does not restrict acidity to hydrogen-containing compounds, but his approach, published in 1938, was even more general than Lewis theory.&lt;ref name=review1940/&gt; Usanovich's theory can be summarized as defining an acid as anything that accepts negative species or donates positive ones, and a base as the reverse. This pushed the concept of acid‚Äìbase reactions to its logical limits, and even redefined the concept of [[redox]] (oxidation‚Äìreduction) as a special case of acid‚Äìbase reactions, and so did not become widespread, despite being easier to understand than Lewis theory, which required detailed familiarity with atomic structure.
Some examples of Usanovich acid‚Äìbase reactions include:

: {{chem|Na|2|O}} (base) + {{chem|SO|3}} (acid) ‚Üí 2 {{chem|Na|+}} + {{chem|SO|4|2‚àí}} (species exchanged: anion {{chem|O|2‚àí}})
: 3 {{chem|(NH|4|)|2|S}} (base) + {{chem|Sb|2|S|3}} (acid) ‚Üí 6 {{chem|NH|4|+}} + 2 {{chem|SbS|4|2‚àí}} (species exchanged: anion {{chem|S|2‚àí}})
: Na (base) + Cl (acid) ‚Üí {{chem|Na|+}} + {{chem|Cl|‚àí}} (species exchanged: electron)

===Lux‚ÄìFlood definition===
This acid‚Äìbase theory was a revival of oxygen theory of acids and bases, proposed by German chemist [[Hermann Lux]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Solubility of Water Vapor in Alkali Borate Melts|last=Franz|first=H.|year=1966|journal=J.

This definition describes an '''acid''' as an oxide ion ({{chem|O|2‚àí}}) acceptor and a '''base''' as an oxide ion donor.

{{Main|HSAB theory}}
In 1963&lt;ref name=pearson&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Hard and Soft Acids and Bases|last=Pearson|first=Ralph G.|journal= [[J. Am. Chem.

'Hard' applies to species that are small, have high charge states, and are weakly polarizable. 'Soft' applies to species that are large, have low charge states and are strongly polarizable. Acids and bases interact, and the most stable interactions are hard‚Äìhard and soft‚Äìsoft. This theory has found use in organic and inorganic chemistry.

==Acid‚Äìalkali reaction==
{{cleanup|section|date=December 2009}}

{{Merge to|Neutralization (chemistry)|date=January 2010}}
An acid‚Äìalkali reaction is a special case of an acid‚Äìbase reaction, where the [[base (chemistry)|base]] used is also an [[alkali]]. When an acid reacts with an alkali it forms a [[Salt (chemistry)|metal salt]] and water. Acid‚Äìalkali reactions are also a type of [[Neutralization (chemistry)|neutralization reaction]].

In general acid‚Äìalkali reactions can be simplified to

:[[hydroxide|{{chem|OH|‚àí}}(aq)]] + [[Hydronium|{{chem|H|+}}(aq)]] ‚Üí [[water (molecule)|{{chem|H|2|O}}]]

by omitting [[spectator ions]].

'''Acids''' are generally pure substances which contain [[hydron (chemistry)|hydrogen ions]] ({{chem|H|+}}) or cause them to be produced in solutions. Hydrochloric acid ({{chem|HCl}}) and sulfuric acid ({{chem|H|2|SO|4}}) are common examples. In water, these break apart into ions:

:{{chem|HCl}} ‚Üí {{chem|H|+}}(aq) + {{chem|Cl|‚àí}}(aq)
:{{chem|H|2|SO|4}} ‚Üí {{chem|H|+}}(aq) + {{chem|HSO|4|‚àí}}(aq)

An '''alkali''' is a base, more precisely a base which contains a metal from column 1 or 2 of the periodic table (the alkali metals or the alkaline earth metals). Alkalis may be defined as ''soluble bases'', which means they must be able to dissolve in water. Bases generally are defined as substances which contain hydroxide ion ({{chem|OH|‚àí}}) or produce it in solution. Therefore, one may also speak of hydroxide bases which dissolve in water, and thus these would also be alkalis. Some examples, then, of alkalis would be sodium hydroxide (NaOH), potassium hydroxide (KOH), magnesium hydroxide (Mg(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Note that only hydroxides with an alkali metal‚Äîcolumn 1‚Äîare very soluble in water; hydroxides with an alkaline earth metal‚Äîcolumn 2‚Äîare not as soluble. Some sources{{which?|date=February 2011}} will even say the alkaline earth metal hydroxides are insoluble.

To produce hydroxide ions in water, the alkali breaks apart into ions as below:

:{{chem|NaOH}} ‚Üí {{chem|Na|+}}(aq) + {{chem|OH|‚àí}}(aq)

However, alkalies may also have a broader definition which includes carbonates ({{chem|CO|3|2‚àí}}) bonded to a column 1 metal, an ammonium ion ({{chem|NH|4|+}}), or an amine (NH&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; radical) as the positive ion. Examples of alkalis would then also include {{chem|Li|2|CO|3}}, {{chem|Na|2|CO|3}}, and (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.

There seems to be conflicting information on acid-base reactions being '''neutralization reactions'''. Some sources define a neutralization reaction as the reaction between an acid and a base which produces a salt and water. Yet in the book '''Chemical Misconceptions: Prevention, Diagnosis and Cure''' by K. Tabor (2002), it is noted that ‚Äúthe term neutralization is usually reserved for acid‚Äìalkali reactions.‚Äù Thus this does not make acid‚Äìalkali a ''type'' of neutralization reaction, but the ''only kind'' of neutralization reaction.

There are many '''uses''' of neutralization reactions which are acid-alkali reactions. A very common use is antacid tablets. These are designed to neutralize excess stomach acid (HCl) which may be causing discomfort in the stomach or lower esophagus. Also in the digestive tract, neutralization reactions are used when food is moved from the stomach to the intestines. In order for the nutrients to be absorbed through the intestinal wall, an alkaline environment is needed, so the pancreas produce an antacid bicarbonate to cause this transformation to occur.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wddty.com/UtilityPages/Print.aspx?nodeId=-3363800369331166395 Print this page].

Another common use, though perhaps not as widely known, is in fertilizers and control of soil pH. Slaked lime (calcium hydroxide) or limestone (calcium carbonate) may be worked into soil that is too acidic for plant growth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.practicalchemistry.org/experiments/intermediate/acids-alkalis-and-salts/neutralisation-curing-acidity,103,EX.html Neutralisation ‚Äì ‚Äòcuring acidity‚Äô - Acids, alkalis and salts - Intermediate - Experiments].

These are salts utilized in the fertilizer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.docbrown.info/page04/4_74revNH3.htm Reversible Reactions, Chemical Equilibrium, Ammonia &amp; Nitric acid, their Manufacture and Uses e.g. in Artificial Fertilisers]&lt;/ref&gt;

Industrially, a by-product of the burning of coal, sulfur dioxide gas may combine with water vapor in the air to eventually produce sulfuric acid, which falls as acid rain. To prevent the sulfur dioxide from being released, a device known as a scrubber gleans the gas from smoke stacks. This device first blows calcium carbonate into the combustion chamber where it decomposes into calcium oxide (lime) and carbon dioxide. This lime then reacts with the sulfur dioxide produced forming calcium sulfite. A suspension of lime is then injected into the mixture to produce a slurry, which removes the calcium sulfite and any remaining unreacted sulfur dioxide.&lt;ref&gt;Zumdahl, 2000, pp.&amp;nbsp;226, 228&lt;/ref&gt;

'''`Ali ibn al-Husayn ul-IsbahƒÅnƒ´''' ({{lang-ar|ÿ£ÿ®Ÿà ÿßŸÑŸÅÿ±ÿ¨ ÿßŸÑÿ£ÿµŸÅŸáÿßŸÜŸä}}), also known as '''Abu-l-Faraj''' or, in the West, as '''Abulfaraj''' (897‚Äì967) was an [[Greater Iran|Iranian]] scholar of [[Arab]]-[[Quraysh (tribe)|Quraysh]] origin who is noted for collecting and preserving ancient Arabic lyrics and poems in his major work, the ''KitƒÅb al-AghƒÅnƒ´''.

==Biography==
Abu al-Faraj al-I·π£bahƒÅnƒ´ was born in [[Isfahan (city)|Isfahan]], [[Greater Iran|Persia]], but spent his youth and made his early studies in [[Baghdad]], [[Iraq]]. He was a direct descendant of the last of the [[Umayyad]] [[caliph]]s, [[Marwan II]], and was thus connected with the Umayyad rulers in [[Spain]], and seems to have kept up a correspondence with them and to have sent them some of his works. He became famous for his knowledge of early Arabian antiquities. 

His later life was spent in various parts of the Islamic world, in [[Aleppo]] with its governor [[Hamdanid Dynasty|Sayf ad-Dawlah]] (to whom he dedicated the ''Book of Songs''), in [[Ray, Iran|Ray]] with the [[Buwayhid]] [[vizier]] [[Ibn 'Abbad]], and elsewhere. 

Although he wrote [[poetry]], also an anthology of verses on the [[monastery|monasteries]] of [[Mesopotamia]] and [[Egypt]], and a genealogical work, his fame rests upon his ''Book of Songs'' ([[Kitab al-Aghani]]).

==The Book of Songs==
''[[Kitab al-Aghani]]'' (Book of Songs), a collection of poems and songs with the stories of the composers and singers in many volumes from the oldest epoch of Arabic literature down to the 9th cent.&lt;ref&gt;[[Chambers Biographical Dictionary]], ISBN 0-550-18022-2, page 5&lt;/ref&gt;  The poems were put to music, but the musical signs are no longer readable. Because of the accompanying biographical annotations on the authors and composers, the work is an important historical source. It contains a mass of information as to the life and customs of the early Arabs, and is the most valuable authority we have for their pre-Islamic and early Islamic days.

'''Alcoba√ßa''' ({{IPA-pt|a…´kuÀàbas…ê}}) is a city in [[Alcoba√ßa Municipality]] in [[Leiria District]] and [[Oeste Subregion]], in Portugal, formerly included in the [[Estremadura Province (1936-1976)|Estremadura Province]]. The city grew along the valleys of the rivers Alcoa and Ba√ßa, from which it derives its name. The municipality has a total population of 55,269 inhabitants and a total area of 408.1&amp;nbsp;km¬≤. The city itself has a population of 15,800 inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://codigopostal.ciberforma.pt/cidades/cidade.asp?cid=6 ] Mail post reference of Portugal&lt;/ref&gt;

The city of Alcoba√ßa became notable after the [[List of Portuguese monarchs|first king]] of Portugal, [[Afonso Henriques]], decided to build there a church to celebrate the conquest of [[Santar√©m, Portugal|Santar√©m]] to the Moors, in 1147. The church later evolved into the [[Monastery of Alcoba√ßa]], one of the most magnificent [[gothic architecture|gothic]] monuments in the country. In the [[Church (building)|church]] are the tombs of [[Peter I of Portugal|King Peter I]] and his murdered mistress [[In√™s de Castro]]. Over the centuries this monastery had an important role on [[Portuguese culture]].

A few kilometers to the north of Alcoba√ßa is located the [[Monastery of Batalha]], another wondrous gothic building constructed in memory of a different important battle, that of [[Battle of Aljubarrota|Aljubarrota]]. To the west of Alcoba√ßa is the well-known former fishing village of [[Nazar√©, Portugal|Nazar√©]] ,now a town. To the south is the city of [[Caldas da Rainha]] and the quaint medieval town of [[√ìbidos, Portugal|√ìbidos]] that is an attraction for any tourists that enjoys a true glimpse of the past. Also to the northeast is the town of [[Porto de M√≥s]] with its fanciful rebuilt castle.

== History ==
A town that only became notable in the 12th century when it became the site for the construction of Portugal's largest church. In the month of March in 1147 the fledgling King, Dom [[Afonso Henriques]], defeated the Moors by capturing the city of [[Santar√©m, Portugal|Santar√©m]]. As a suitable memory to this splendid victory he vowed to build a magnificent home for the [[Cistercian|Order of Cistercians]]. It took another 76 years before this task was completed. The [[monarchy]] continued to endow the [[Monastery of Alcoba√ßa]] with further construction and 60 years later [[Dinis I of Portugal|King Dinis]] built the main cloister but it was only in 1252 that the [[Monastery]] was inaugurated within the [[Church (building)|church]].

In the church are the tombs of [[Peter I of Portugal|King Peter I]] and his murdered mistress [[In√™s de Castro]] and with it the story of the tragic liaison between Pedro and his ever-lasting love for In√™s. Forced at an early age by royal duty he had to marry Constanza, the ''[[Infanta]]'' (Princess) of [[Crown of Castile|Castile]]. She died within a short time of the marriage ceremony and created the opportunity for Dom Pedro to escape with his true love and live in the city of [[Coimbra]]. [[Afonso IV of Portugal|King Afonso IV]] his father, believing that the family of In√™s to be a threat to his own kingdom had her murdered. Shortly after the death of his father Dom Pedro declared that he had married In√™s in a prior secret ceremony in [[Bragan√ßa, Portugal|Bragan√ßa]], promptly taking revenge on the killers in a very gruesome manner and exhumed her body. He presented the embalmed corpse at court with a crown on her head and demanded that all his courtiers kneel and individually pay homage to her decomposed hand. Today, their ornate tombs face each other so that on [[Judgment Day]] his first sight would be of his beloved In√™s.

During the following centuries the monks from this monastery had an influencing effect on Portuguese culture. Notably, in 1269 they were the first to give public lessons to their flock, and later they produced the authoritative history on Portugal in a series of books. In 1810 the invading French pillaged the Abbey taking with them most of the many treasures including a noteworthy library. Whatever the items remaining were then later stolen in 1834 during an anti-clerical riot and the extinction of religious Orders in Portugal.

== City information==
The main feature of the city is essentially the Monastery that proudly presents a long and sombre fa√ßade with 18th Century embellishments. This austerity is further emphasized in the cloisters with its apt name of &quot;Cloister of Silence&quot;. In contrast within the Abbey is the massive kitchen with a running stream specially diverted to pass through as a supply of fresh water. The open area of the kitchen chimney is large enough to take a whole ox for roasting. The surround to the sacristy doorway is an outstanding example of [[Manueline]] decoration. In 1794, Lord Beckford visited the Abbey and commented that he found some 300 monks &quot;living in a very splendid manner&quot;!

== Nearby locations ==
A few kilometers to the north of Alcoba√ßa is another wondrous building constructed in memory of a different important battle, that of [[Battle of Aljubarrota|Aljubarrota]] in 1385, when [[John I of Portugal|Dom Jo√£o I]] defeated the Castilians and ensuring two hundred years of independence from the Spanish invaders. The construction of the Abbey at [[Batalha]] commenced in 1388 and was added to by various Portuguese Kings over these next two centuries. To the east of Batalha is the world famous location of [[F√°tima]] and a point of pilgrimage for the Roman Catholic religion due to the [[Our Lady of Fatima|vision of the Virgin Mary]] in 1917 by three young children whilst tending their flock. To the west of Alcoba√ßa is the well-known fishing village of [[Nazar√©, Portugal|Nazar√©]]. Today, the village is now a small town and a popular holiday resort with most of its past and traditions having rapidly evaporated in the course of time. A very successful Portuguese feature film was made in the early 20th century that dramatically captured the primitive and dangerous life of these fishermen. Stoutly Catholic, the inhabitants have retained some of their past as can be still seen in their own particular style of costume. To the south is [[Caldas da Rainha]] and the quaint medieval town of [[√ìbidos, Portugal|√ìbidos]] that is an attraction for any tourists that enjoys a true glimpse of the past. Also to the south is the town of [[Porto de M√≥s]] with its fanciful rebuilt castle. This town borders the Nature Reserve [[Parque Natural das Serras de Aire e Candeeiros]]. These 390 square kilometres of limestone-covered landscape is also known for its underground caverns. The best known being the [[Gruta de Moinhos Velhos|Grutas de Mira de Aire]] can be visited and consists of tunnels, caverns with stalactites, stalagmites, lakes, and a music and light finale.

      <text xml:space="preserve">:''This article is about the mythological creature. See [[Amphisbaenia]] for information on the [[suborder]] and ''[[Amphisbaena (lizard)]]'' for the [[genus]].''
[[Image:Uroboros.png|thumb|right|200px|Amphisbaena]]
'''Amphisbaena''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|Àå|√¶|m|f|…™|s|Àà|b|iÀê|n|…ô}}, plural: '''amphisbaenae'''), '''amphisbaina''', '''amphisbene''', '''amphisboena''', '''amphisbona''', '''amphista''', '''amphivena''', or '''anphivena''' (the last two being feminine), a [[Greek language|Greek]] word, from ''amphis'', meaning &quot;both ways&quot;, and ''bainein'', meaning &quot;to go&quot;, also called the Mother of Ants, is a [[mythological]], [[ant]]-eating [[Serpent (symbolism)|serpent]] with a head at each end. According to [[Greek mythology]], the amphisbaena was spawned from the blood that dripped from the [[Gorgon]] [[Medusa]]'s head as [[Perseus]] flew over the [[Libyan Desert]] with it in his hand. Cato's army then encountered it along with other serpents on the march. Amphisbaenae fed off of the corpses left behind. The amphisbaena has been referred to by the [[poet]]s, such as [[Nicander]], [[John Milton]], [[Alexander Pope]], [[Alfred Tennyson|Alfred, Lord Tennyson]], and [[A. E. Housman]], and the amphisbaena as a mythological and legendary creature has been referenced by [[Lucan (poet)|Lucan]], [[Pliny the Elder]], [[Isidore of Seville]], and [[Thomas Browne]], the last of whom debunked its existence.

== Appearance ==
[[Image:EdlesboroughS02.jpg|thumb|A 15th-century amphisbaena on a [[misericord]] in Buckinghamshire]]

{{quote|The amphisbaena has a twin head, that is one at the tail end as well, as though it were not enough for poison to be poured out of one mouth.}}&lt;div align=right&gt;--[[Pliny the Elder]]. ''[[Naturalis Historia]]'', ca. 77&amp;nbsp;AD&lt;/div&gt;
This early description of the amphisbaena depicts a venomous, dual-headed snakelike creature. However, [[Medieval]] and later drawings often show it with two or more scaled feet, particularly chicken feet, and feathered wings. Some even depict it as a horned, dragon-like creature with a serpent-headed tail and small, round ears, while others have both &quot;necks&quot; of equal size so that it cannot be determined which is the rear head. Many descriptions of the amphisbaena say its eyes glow like candles or lightning, but the poet [[Nicander]] seems to contradict this by describing it as &quot;always dull of eye&quot;. He also says: &quot;From either end protrudes a blunt chin; each is far from each other.&quot; [[Nicander]]'s account seems to be referring to what is indeed called the [[Amphisbaenia]].

== Habitat ==
The amphisbaena makes its home in the [[desert]].

== Folk medicine ==
In ancient times, the supposedly dangerous amphisbaena had many uses in the art of [[folk medicine]] and other such remedies. It is said that expecting women wearing a live amphisbaena around their necks would have safe pregnancies; however, if one's goal is to cure ailments such as [[arthritis]] or the [[common cold]], one should wear only its skin. By eating the meat of the amphisbaena, one could attract many lovers of the [[opposite sex]], and slaying one during the [[full moon]] could give power to one who is pure of heart and mind. [[Lumberjacks]] suffering from cold weather on the job could nail its carcass or skin to a tree to keep warm, while in the process allowing the tree to fell easier.

== Origins ==
In ''[http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/HistSciTech/subcollections/BestiaryAbout.html The Book of Beasts]'', [[T.H. White]] suggests that the creature derives from sightings of the [[Amphisbaenia|worm lizards]] of the same name.  These creatures are found in the Mediterranean countries where many of these legends originated.

== Dungeons &amp; Dragons ==
In the ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'' [[fantasy]] [[role-playing game]], the [[List of Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons 1st edition monsters|amphisbaena]] is depicted as in traditional myth as a giant serpent with a head at both ends. It travels by grasping one head in the other and rolling like a hoop. The fangs of the amphisbaena are so poisonous that anything successfully bitten by it dies instantly.

== Cultural references ==
*The short story &quot;[[There Are More Things]]&quot; by [[Jorge Luis Borges]] from ''[[The Book of Sand (book)|The Book of Sand]]'' refers to an amphisbaena and concerns a similar, though mostly undescribed, monster.
*The CD art on [[Powerman 5000]]'s album ''[[Transform (album)|Transform]]'', drawn by [[Spider One]], contains symbols reminiscent of the amphisbaena. Adorning the CD artwork are two-headed arrows wrapped back pointing at each other, and underneath the CD are two worm-like creatures face to face forming a circle.
*The children's book ''[[Dragons, Dragons]]'' by [[Eric Carle]] features an amphisbaena.
*The first boss of ''[[La-Mulana]]'' is an amphisbaena.

Three of these alcohols, active amyl alcohol, methyl (n) propyl carbinol, and methyl isopropyl carbinol, are [[optical isomerism|optically active]], as they contain an asymmetric carbon atom.

The most important is isobutyl carbinol, this being the chief constituent of fermentation amyl alcohol, and consequently a constituent of [[fusel oil]].  It can be separated from fusel oil by shaking with strong [[brine]] solution, separating the oily layer from the brine layer and [[distillation|distilling]] it, the portion boiling between 125 and 140 ¬∞C. being collected.  For further purification it may be shaken with hot [[lime water]], the oily layer separated, dried with [[calcium chloride]] and fractionated, the fraction boiling between 128 and 132 ¬∞C only being collected.  It may be synthesized from [[isobutanol]] by conversion into isovaleraldehyde, which is subsequently reduced to isobutyl carbinol by means of [[sodium amalgam]].

It is a colourless liquid of density 0.8247 g/cm¬≥ (0 ¬∞C), boiling at 131.6 ¬∞C, slightly soluble in water, easily soluble in organic solvents.  It possesses a characteristic strong smell and a sharp burning taste.  When pure, it is nontoxic, while the impure product is toxic.{{Why?|date=June 2009}}  On passing its vapour through a red-hot tube, it decomposes with production of [[acetylene]], [[ethylene]], [[propylene]], and other compounds.  It is [[oxidation|oxidized]] by [[chromic acid]] to isovaleraldehyde, and it forms crystalline addition compounds with [[calcium chloride]] and [[tin(IV) chloride]].

The other amyl alcohols may be obtained synthetically.  Of these, tertiary butyl carbinol has been the most difficult to obtain, its synthesis having first been reported in 1891, by L. Tissier &lt;ref&gt;Comptes Rendus'', 1891, 112, p. 1065&lt;/ref&gt; by the reduction of a mixture of trimethyl acetic acid and trimethylacetyl chloride with sodium amalgam.  It is a solid that melts at 48 to 50 ¬∞C and boils at 112.3 ¬∞C.

'''Amyl nitrite''' is the [[chemical compound]] with the [[chemical formula|formula]] C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;ONO. A variety of isomers are known, but they all feature an [[amyl]] group attached to the nitrito [[functional group]].  The alkyl group is unreactive and the chemical and biological properties are mainly due to the nitrite group.  Like other [[alkyl nitrite]]s, amyl nitrite is bioactive in mammals, being a [[vasodilator]], which is the basis of its use as a prescription medicine.  As an inhalant, it also has a [[Psychoactive drug|psychoactive]] effect, which has led to its recreational use.

==Nomenclature==
The term &quot;amyl nitrite&quot; encompasses several [[isomers]].  For example, a common form of amyl nitrite with the formula (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CHCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ONO may be more specifically referred to as isoamyl nitrite.   When the amyl group is a [[Alkane#Linear_alkanes|linear or normal (n)]] [[alkyl]] group, the resulting amyl nitrite would have the structural formula CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;ONO.

Despite a very similar name to amyl nitrite, [[amyl nitrate]] has a different chemical composition and different properties.

==Synthesis and reactions==
Alkyl nitrites are prepared by the reaction of [[alcohol]]s with [[nitrous acid]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{OrgSynth |author=[[William A. Noyes|Noyes, W. A.]] |year=1943 |title=n-Butyl Nitrite |volume= |pages= |collvol=2 |collvolpages=108 |prep=CV2P0108}} &lt;/ref&gt;

:C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;OH  +  HONO  ‚Üí  C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;ONO  +  H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
The reaction is called [[esterification]]. Synthesis of alkyl nitrites is, in general, straightforward and can be accomplished in home laboratories. A common procedure includes the dropwise addition of concentrated sulfuric acid to a cooled mixture of an aqueous sodium nitrite solution and an alcohol. The intermediately-formed stoichiometric mixture of nitrous and nitric oxide then converts the alcohol to the alkyl nitrite, which, due to its low density, will form an upper layer that can be easily [[Decantation|decanted]] from the reaction mixture.

Isoamyl nitrite decomposes in the presence of base to give nitrite salts and the [[Amyl alcohol|isoamyl alcohol]]:
:C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;ONO  +  NaOH  ‚Üí C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;OH  +  [[sodium nitrite|NaNO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]

Amyl nitrite, like other alkyl nitrites, reacts with [[carbanion]]s to give [[oxime]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{OrgSynth | author = Chen, Y. K.; Jeon, S.-J; Walsh, P. J.; Nugent, W. A. | title = (2S)-(-)-3-exo-(Morpholino)isoborneol ((-)-MIB) | volume = 82 | pages = 87 | year = 2005 | prep = v82p0087}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amyl nitrites are also useful as reagents in a modification of the [[Sandmeyer reaction]].  The reaction of the alkyl nitrite with an aromatic [[amine]] in a halogenated solvent produces a [[radical (chemistry)|radical]] aromatic species, this then abstracts a [[halogen]] atom from the solvent.  For the synthesis of [[Organoiodine compound|aryl iodide]]s [[diiodomethane]] is used,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Smith | first1 = William B. | last2 = Ho | first2 = Oliver Chenpu | title = Application of the isoamyl nitrite-diiodomethane route to aryl iodides | journal = The Journal of Organic Chemistry | volume = 55 | pages = 2543 | year = 1990 | doi = 10.1021/jo00295a056 | issue = 8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cornforth | first1 = John | last2 = Kumar | first2 = Ashok | last3 = Stuart | first3 = Alan S. | title = Synthesis of substituted dibenzophospholes.

I. G. | last2 = Roy | first2 = D. A. | last3 = Smith | first3 = D.

==Physiological effects==
Amyl nitrite, in common with other [[alkyl nitrites]],&lt;ref&gt;Nickerson, Mark, John O Parker, Thomas P Lowry, and Edward W Swenson. ''[http://www.virusmythpoppersmyth.org/isobutyl_nitrite_and_rela/files/IBNtextnpttypepad.pdf Isobutyl Nitrite and Related Compounds]'', 1st ed. San Francisco: Pharmex, Ltd, 1979. &lt;/ref&gt; is a potent [[vasodilator]] (''i.e.,'' it expands [[blood vessel]]s, resulting in lowering of the [[blood pressure]]).   Alkyl nitrites function as a source of [[nitric oxide]], which signals for relaxation of the [[involuntary muscle]]s.  Physical effects include decrease in blood pressure, headache, flushing of the face, increased heart rate, dizziness, and relaxation of involuntary muscles, especially the [[blood vessel]] walls and the [[anal sphincter]].  There are no [[withdrawal]] symptoms.  [[Overdose]] symptoms include [[nausea]], [[emesis]] (vomiting), [[hypotension]], [[hypoventilation]], [[dyspnea]] (shortness of breath), and [[fainting|syncope]] (fainting). The effects set in very quickly, typically within a few seconds and disappear soon after (within minutes).

It induces the formation of [[methemoglobin]], which sequesters cyanide as nontoxic cyanomethemoglobin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title = Cyanide Antidotes: from Amyl Nitrite to Hydroxocobalamin - Which Antidote is Best?| author = Vale, J. A.| journal = [[Toxicology (journal)|Toxicology]]| year = 2001| volume = 168| issue = 1| pages = 37‚Äì38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
Amyl nitrite is employed medically to treat [[ischaemic heart disease|heart disease]]s such as [[Angina pectoris|angina]] and also to treat [[cyanide poisoning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title = The Effects of Nitroglycerin and Amyl Nitrite on Arteriolar and Venous Tone in the Human Forearm| author = Cheng, L.; Goodwin, C. A.; Schully, M. F.; Kakkar, V. V.; Claeson, G.| journal = [[Circulation (journal)|Circulation]]| year = 1965| volume = 3| issue = 2| pages = 755 | pmid = 4954412 }}&lt;/ref&gt;    It is also used as an [[inhalant]] drug that induces a brief euphoric state, and when combined with other intoxicatant stimulant drugs such as [[cocaine]] or ecstasy (see [[MDMA]]), the euphoric state intensifies and is prolonged. Once some stimulative drugs wear off, a common side effect is a period of [[Depression (mood)|depression]] or [[anxiety]], colloquially called a &quot;come down&quot;; amyl nitrite is sometimes used to combat these negative after-effects.  This effect, combined with its dissociative effects, makes it an attractive but risky recreational drug (see [[poppers]]).&lt;ref&gt;AJ Giannini, AE Slaby, MC Giannini.

'''Autumn''' (also '''Fall''' in American English) is one of the four [[temperate]] [[season]]s. Autumn marks the transition from [[summer]] into [[winter]]  usually in [[September]] ([[Northern Hemisphere]]) or [[March]] ([[Southern Hemisphere]]) when the arrival of night becomes noticeably earlier. 

The [[equinox]]es might be expected to be in the middle of their respective seasons, but temperature lag (caused by the thermal latency of the ground and sea) means that seasons appear later than dates calculated from a purely astronomical perspective.  The actual lag varies with region.  Some cultures regard the autumnal equinox as &quot;mid-autumn&quot;, others with a longer lag treat it as the start of autumn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crh.noaa.gov/glossary.php?word=autumn |title=NOAA's National Weather Service - Glossary |publisher=Crh.noaa.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Meteorologists (and most of the temperate countries in the southern hemisphere)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=06:06 AM, Sat 07 Aug |url=http://www.tourism.net.nz/new-zealand/about-new-zealand/weather-and-climate.html |title=New Zealand Weather and Climate, New Zealand Weather, Temperatures and Climate in New Zealand |publisher=Tourism.net.nz |date= |accessdate=2010-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; use a definition based on months, with autumn being September, October and November in the northern hemisphere,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/features/understanding/autumn_forecasting.shtml |title=Weather Centre - Features - Understanding Weather - Autumn Forecasting |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=2010-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and March, April and May in the southern hemisphere.

In North America, autumn is usually considered to start with the September equinox.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/09/22/first-day-of-fall-2010-au_n_734692.html |title=First Day Of Fall 2010: Autumn Equinox Photos |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In traditional East Asian [[solar term]], autumn starts on or around 8 August and ends on about 7 November. In Ireland, the autumn months according to the national meteorological service, [[Met √âireann]], are September, October and November.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.met.ie/climate/monthly_summarys/autumn07.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to the [[Irish Calendar]] which is based on ancient [[Celts|Celtic]] traditions, autumn lasts throughout the months of August, September, and October, or possibly a few days later, depending on tradition. In Australia, autumn officially begins on 1 March and ends 31 May.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://museumvictoria.com.au/discoverycentre/infosheets/planets/the-sun-and-the-seasons/ |title=So when do we actually start the seasons? |publisher=Museumvictoria.com.au |date= |accessdate=2010-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vast diversity of the ecological zones of the South American, African and Australian continents renders the rigid European, North Asian and North American seasonal calendar an imposed cultural concept rather than relevant to climactic conditions. The seasonal cycles as named and described by the various indigenous Aboriginal peoples of Australia differ substantially from one another according to their local geographical and ecological environment and are intricately dependent on local environmental events and resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bom.gov.au/iwk/climate_culture/Indig_seasons.shtml |title=Australian Aboriginal Seasons |publisher=Bom.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2010-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word ''autumn'' comes from the [[Old French]] word ''autompne'' (''automne'' in modern French), and was later normalised to the original [[Latin]] word ''autumnus''.&lt;ref&gt;''Etymology of 'autumn' '' - New [[Shorter Oxford English Dictionary]], 1997 Edition&lt;/ref&gt; There are rare examples of its use as early as the 12th century, but it became common by the 16th century.

Before the 16th century, ''[[harvest]]'' was the term usually used to refer to the season, as it is common in other [[West Germanic language|West Germanic languages]] to this day (cf. Dutch ''herfst'' and German ''Herbst''). However, as more people gradually moved from working the land to living in towns (especially those who could read and write,{{cite}} the only people whose use of language we now know), the word ''harvest'' lost its reference to the time of year and came to refer only to the actual activity of reaping, and ''autumn'', as well as ''fall'', began to replace it as a reference to the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|harvest}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|autumn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The alternative word ''fall'' for the season traces its origins to old [[Germanic languages]]. The exact derivation is unclear, the [[Old English language|Old English]] ''fi√¶ll'' or ''feallan'' and the [[Old Norse language|Old Norse]] ''fall'' all being possible candidates. However, these words all have the meaning &quot;to fall from a height&quot; and are clearly derived either from a common root or from each other. The term came to denote the season in 16th century England, a contraction of [[Middle English]] expressions like &quot;fall of the leaf&quot; and &quot;fall of the year&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|fall}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 17th century, [[British colonisation of the Americas|English emigration to the British colonies]] in North America was at its peak, and the new settlers took the English language with them. While the term ''fall'' gradually became obsolete in Britain, it became the more common term in North America, where ''autumn'' is nonetheless preferred in scientific and often in literary contexts.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

==Harvest association==
Association with the transition from warm to cold weather, and its related status as the season of the primary harvest, has dominated its themes and popular images. In Western cultures, personifications of autumn are usually pretty, well-fed females adorned with fruits, vegetables and grains that ripen at this time. Most ancient cultures featured autumnal celebrations of the harvest, often the most important on their calendars. Still extant echoes of these celebrations are found in the mid-autumn [[Thanksgiving]] holiday of the United States and Canada, and the Jewish [[Sukkot]] holiday with its roots as a full-moon harvest festival of &quot;tabernacles&quot; (huts wherein the harvest was processed and which later gained religious significance). There are also the many North American Indian festivals tied to harvest of autumnally ripe foods gathered in the wild, the Chinese Mid-Autumn or [[Moon festival]], and many others. The predominant mood of these autumnal celebrations is a gladness for the fruits of the earth mixed with a certain melancholy linked to the imminent arrival of harsh weather.

This view is presented in English poet [[John Keats]]' poem ''[[To Autumn]]'', where he describes the season as a time of bounteous fecundity, a time of 'mellow fruitfulness'.

==Melancholy association==
[[File:Mallard Lake in Golden Gate Park.jpg|right|thumb|A brightly coloured tree contrasts the green foliage which surrounds it]]
Autumn in poetry has often been associated with [[melancholy]]. The possibilities of summer are gone, and the chill of winter is on the horizon. Skies turn grey, and people turn inward, both physically and mentally.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.symbolism.org/writing/books/sp/4/page2.html Cyclical Regenerative Time - (c) Autumn] (from 'Symbolism of Place', symbolism.org website)&lt;/ref&gt; 

Similar examples may be found in Irish poet [[William Butler Yeats]]' poem ''[[The Wild Swans at Coole]]'' where the maturing season that the poet observes symbolically represents his own ageing self.  Like the natural world that he observes he too has reached his prime and now must look forward to the inevitability of old age and death. French poet [[Paul Verlaine]]'s &quot;''[[Chanson d'automne]]''&quot; (&quot;Autumn Song&quot;) is likewise characterised by strong, painful feelings of sorrow. [[John Keats|Keats]]' ''[[To Autumn]]'', written in September 1819, echoes this sense of melancholic reflection, but also emphasises the lush abundance of the season.

==Other associations==
[[File:Pumpkins-2009.jpg|right|thumb|[[Halloween]] [[pumpkin]]s]]
Autumn is also associated with the [[Halloween]] season (which in turn was influenced by [[Samhain]], a Celtic autumn festival),&lt;ref name=&quot;ENC&quot;&gt;[http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761572079/Halloween.html Halloween] (from the [[Microsoft Encarta]] encyclopaedia). [http://www.webcitation.org/5kwKs5kQp Archived] 2009-10-31.&lt;/ref&gt; and with it a widespread marketing campaign that promotes it, in the U.S.A. The television, film, book, costume, home decoration, and confectionery industries use this time of year to promote products closely associated with such a holiday, with promotions going from early September to 31 October, since their themes rapidly lose strength once the holiday ends, and advertising starts concentrating on Christmas.

Since 1997, Autumn has been one of the top 100 names for girls in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/babynames/ Popular Baby Names], Social Security Online.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Indian mythology, autumn is considered to be the preferred season for the goddess of learning [[Saraswati]], who is also known by the name of &quot;goddess of autumn&quot; (Sharada).

==Tourism==

Although [[Autumn leaf color|color change in leaves]] occurs wherever [[deciduous]] trees are found, coloured autumn [[foliage]] is most famously noted in three regions of the world: most of Canada and the United States, [[Eastern Asia]] (including China, Korea, and Japan), and Europe.

Eastern Canada and the [[New England]] region of the United States are famous for the brilliance of their autumnal foliage,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.ns.ca/news/details.asp?id=19990921001 |title=Nova Scotia Capitalizes on Fall Tourism &amp;#124; News Releases &amp;#124; Government of Nova Scotia |publisher=Gov.ns.ca |date=1999-09-21 |accessdate=2010-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/the-complete-guide-to-leafpeeping-612904.html |title=The Complete Guide to Leaf-Peeping - News &amp; Advice, Travel |publisher=The Independent |date=2002-09-14 |accessdate=2010-03-06 | location=London | first=Ben | last=Ross}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this attracts major tourism (worth billions of US$) for the regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Shir Haberman |url=http://www.seacoastonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20071009/NEWS/710090335 |title=Leaf peepers storm N.H., Maine |publisher=SeacoastOnline.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000103&amp;sid=a3vkUrgIabaA&amp;refer=us |title=Record New England Rains Make Foliage `a Dud,' Hurt Tourism |publisher=Bloomberg.com |date=2005-11-04 |accessdate=2010-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alameda''' is a city in [[Alameda County, California]], United States. It is located on '''Alameda Island''' and [[Bay Farm Island]], and is adjacent to [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] in the [[San Francisco Bay]]. The Bay Farm Island (also known as Harbor Bay) portion of the city is adjacent to the [[Oakland International Airport]]. At the 2010 census, the city had a total population of 73,812. Alameda is a [[charter city]], rather than a [[general law city]], meaning that the city can provide for any form of government. Alameda became a charter city and adopted a [[council-manager government]] in 1916, which it retains to the present.

==History==
The island that Alameda occupies was originally a [[peninsula]] connected to Oakland. Much of the peninsula was low-lying and marshy, but on higher ground the peninsula and adjacent parts of what is now downtown Oakland were home to one of the largest coastal oak forests in the world. The area was therefore called ''Encinal'', Spanish for &quot;oak grove&quot;. ''Alameda'' is Spanish for &quot;grove of poplar trees&quot; or &quot;tree-lined avenue&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://education.yahoo.com/reference/dict_en_es/spanish/alameda;_ylt=AmS17PW60RO5ki1NGlCOvxP2s8sF|title=alameda ‚Äì Spanish-English Translation and Pronunciation|work=Yahoo! Education|publisher=Yahoo!|accessdate=February 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was chosen in 1853 by popular vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ci.alameda.ca.us/community/history_01.html|title=A Brief History of Alameda|work=A Brief History of Alameda|publisher=City of Alameda, California|accessdate=February 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The inhabitants at the time of the arrival of the Spanish in the late 18th Century were a local band of the [[Ohlone]] tribe. The peninsula became part of the vast [[Rancho San Antonio (Peralta)|Rancho San Antonio]] granted to Luis Peralta by the Spanish king who claimed California. The grant was later confirmed by the new [[Mexico|Republic of Mexico]] upon its independence from Spain.

Over time, the place became known as Bolsa de Encinal or Encinal de San Antonio.&lt;ref name=CGN&gt;{{California's Geographic Names|592}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city was founded on June 6, 1853, and originally three small settlements were located in the town. &quot;Alameda&quot; referred to the village at Encinal and High Streets, [[Hibbardsville, Alameda, California|Hibbardsville]] was at the North Shore ferry and shipping terminal, and [[Woodstock, Alameda, California|Woodstock]] was on the west near the ferry piers of the [[South Pacific Coast Railroad]] and the [[Central Pacific Railroad|Central Pacific]]. Eventually, the Central Pacific's ferry pier became the [[Alameda Mole]], featuring transit connections between San Francisco ferries and local trollies, Key System buses, and [[Southern Pacific Railroad|Southern Pacific]] (formerly Central Pacific) commuter lines.

The first post office opened in 1854.&lt;ref name=CGN /&gt;  The [[San Francisco and Alameda Railroad]] opened the Encinal station in 1864.&lt;ref name=CGN /&gt;  The Encinal area was also known as Fasskings Station in honor of Frederick Louis Fassking.&lt;ref name=CGN /&gt; Encinal's own post office opened in 1876, was renamed West End in 1877, and closed in 1891.&lt;ref name=CGN /&gt;  The West End area was originally called Bowman's Point in honor of Charles G. Bowman, an early settler.&lt;ref name=CGN /&gt;

The [[Alameda Terminal]] was the site of the arrival of the first train via the [[First Transcontinental Railroad]] into the San Francisco Bay Area on September 6, 1869. The transcontinental terminus was switched to the [[Oakland Mole]] two months later, on November 8, 1869.

The borders of Alameda were made co-extensive with the island in 1872, incorporating Woodstock into Alameda.&lt;ref name=CGN /&gt;

In 1917, an attraction called [[Neptune Beach, California|Neptune Beach]] was built in the area now known as Crab Cove. Often compared to [[Coney Island]], the park was a major attraction in the 1920s and 1930s. The original owners of the facility, the Strehlow family, partnered with a local confectioner to create tastes unique to Neptune Beach. It is not widely known that both the American [[snow cone]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Around Town ‚Äì Alameda, CA | date= | publisher= | url =http://www.alamedamagazine.com/media/Alameda-Magazine/January-February-2005/Around-Town/ | work = | pages = | accessdate = December 6, 2007 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[popsicle]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Alameda Museum Quarterly Newsletter | date= | publisher= | url =http://www.alamedamuseum.org/Quarterly/alamedamuseumQ405.pdf | work = | pages =8 | accessdate = December 4, 2007 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; were first sold at Neptune Beach. The [[Kewpie doll (toy)|Kewpie doll]], handpainted and dressed in unique hand-sewn dresses, became the original prize for winning games at the beach&amp;nbsp;‚Äì another Neptune Beach invention.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} The Strehlows owned and operated the beach on their own, even filling in a section of the bay to add an additional Olympic-size swimming pool and an exceptional roller coaster which must have given riders a tremendous view of the bay. The ''Cottage Baths'' were available for rent.

Neptune Beach's two huge outdoor pools hosted swimming races and exhibitions by famous swimmers such as Olympian [[Johnny Weismuller]], who later starred as the original Tarzan, and [[Jack LaLanne]], who started a chain of health clubs. The park closed down in 1939 because of the [[Great Depression]], the completion of the [[San Francisco ‚Äì Oakland Bay Bridge]], people circumventing paying the admission price and in general, the rise of car culture. Once the Bay Bridge was complete, the rail lines, which ran right past the entrance to Neptune Beach on the way to the Alameda Mole and the Ferry, lost riders in droves. People began using their cars to escape the city and the immediate suburbs like Alameda and traveling further afield in California. Alameda lost its resort status as more distant locations became more attractive to cash-rich San Francisco tourists. Youngsters in town became aware of ways to avoid paying the dime for admission to the park. Strong swimmers or even waders could sneak in on the bay side, just by swimming around the fence.

Some of the resort homes and buildings from the Neptune beach era still exist in present-day Alameda. The [[Croll Building]], on the corner of Webster Street and Central Avenue, was the site of Croll's Gardens and Hotel, famous as training quarters for the some of the greatest fighters in boxing history from 1883 to 1914. James J. Corbett, Bob Fitzsimmons, Jim Jefferies, Jack Johnson, and many other champions all stayed and trained here. Today this beautiful preserved building is home to Croll's Pizza and the New Zealander Restaurant. Neptune Court, just a block away on the corner of Central Ave. and McKay Ave., provides another glimpse of what resort life was like in Alameda in the 1920s. A short walk near Crab Cove will reveal many more historic gems.

The vast majority of the Neptune Beach structures&amp;nbsp;‚Äì the hand-carved carousel from the world-famed Dentzel Company, the [[Ferris wheel]], the roller coaster, and other rides&amp;nbsp;‚Äì were auctioned off in 1940 for mere pennies on the dollar of their original cost. Today,{{When|date=February 2011}} Alameda resident Michael Schiess seeks to preserve some of the historic artifacts from the Neptune Beach era at the [http://www.nbam.org Neptune Beach Amusement Museum] (NBAM). A consequence of the Neptune Beach closing around 1940 was a total dearth of quality, clean swimming facilities in town. A grass roots effort to create swimming pools at two high schools and two city parks would continue into the early 1960s.

When the railroad came to town in the 1860s Park Street developed into the major thoroughfare of the city and the location of the main Alameda train station, residents of Old Alameda pulled up stakes and moved across town to the new downtown. The street's location was chosen by two landowners who wished to attract tenants and development to their land. As a result they designated their mutual property line as Park Street.

The need for expanded shipping facilities led to the dredging of a canal through the marshland between Oakland and Alameda in 1902, turning Alameda into an island. Most of the soil from the canal was used to fill in nearby marshland. The area of Alameda called Bay Farm Island is no longer an island, but is attached by fill to Oakland. In his youth, author [[Jack London]] was known to take part in oyster pirating in the highly productive oyster beds near Bay Farm Island, today long gone. The [[Alameda Works Shipyard]] was one of the largest and best equipped shipyards in the country. In the 1950s, Alameda's industrial and ship building industries thrived along the estuary, where the world's first-ever, land-based, containerized shipping crane was used. Today,{{When|date=February 2011}}  the [[Port of Oakland]] across the estuary serves as one of the largest ports on the West Coast, using the shipping technologies originally experimented with in Alameda. As of March 21, 2006, Alameda is a &quot;Coast Guard City,&quot; one of seven in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4176/is_20060322/ai_n16140812|title=After 80 years, Alameda named 'Coast Guard City'|last=Bender|first=Kristin|date=March 22, 2006|work=Oakland Tribune|publisher=BNET|accessdate=February 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the regular trains running to the Alameda Mole, Alameda was also served by local steam commuter lines of the Southern Pacific (initially, the Central Pacific) which were later transformed into the [[East Bay Electric Lines]]. Southern Pacific's electrified trains were not [[streetcar]]s, but full-sized railroad cars which connected to the mainland by bridges at Webster Street and Fruitvale (only the latter bridge survives today). The trains ran to both the [[Oakland Long Wharf|Oakland Mole]] and the Alameda Mole. In fact, one line which ran between the two moles was dubbed the &quot;Horseshoe Line&quot; for the shape of the route on a map. Soon after the completion of the Bay Bridge, Alameda trains ran directly to San Francisco on the lower deck of the bridge, the ferries having been rendered unnecessary.  Alameda was the site of the Southern Pacific's West Alameda Shops where all the electric trains were maintained and repaired.

In the 1930s [[Pan American Airways]] established a [[seaplane]] port along the fill that led to the Alameda Mole. This was the original home base for the famous [[China Clipper]] flying boat.
In 1929, the University of California established the San Francisco Airdrome located near the current Webster Street tube as a public airport. The Bay Airdrome had its gala christening party in 1930. The airfield was a busy place, as an early home base for Coastal Air Freight, Varney Air Lines, West Coast Air Transport, Western Air Express, the transbay Air Ferries, and Boeing's Pacific Air Transport. The Airdrome was closed in 1941 when its air traffic interfered with the newly built Naval Air Station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airfields-freeman.com/CA/Airfields_CA_Oakland.htm#sanfranbay|title=Abandoned &amp; Little-Known Airfields: Oakland Area|last=Freeman|first=Paul|date=December 27, 2009|work=Abandoned &amp; Little-Known Airfields: California|publisher=Paul Freeman|accessdate=February 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the advent of World War II, a vast stretch of the marshy area southwest of the Alameda Mole was filled and the [[Naval Air Station Alameda]] established. This major Naval facility included a large airfield, as well as docks for several [[aircraft carriers]]. It closed in 1997.

In the late 1950s the Utah Construction Company began a land fill beyond the ''Old Sea Wall'' and created ''South Shore''.

==Geography==

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of 23.0&amp;nbsp;square miles (59.5&amp;nbsp;km¬≤), of which, 10.8&amp;nbsp;square miles (28.0&amp;nbsp;km¬≤) of it is land and 12.2&amp;nbsp;square miles (31.5&amp;nbsp;km¬≤) (52.98%) is water.

Today, the city consists of the main original section, with the former Naval Air Station (NAS) at the west end of Alameda Island, &quot;Southshore&quot; along the southern side of Alameda Island, and Bay Farm Island, which is part of the mainland proper. The area of the former NAS is now known as &quot;Alameda Point.&quot; The Southshore area is separated from the main part of Alameda Island by a lagoon; the north shore of the lagoon is located approximately where the original south shore of the island was. Alameda Point and Southshore are built on bay fill.

Not all of Alameda Island is part of the City of Alameda. Although nearly all of the island is in Alameda city limits, a small portion of a dump site west of the former runways at Alameda Point pokes out far enough into San Francisco Bay that it is over the county line and part of the [[San Francisco|City and County of San Francisco]].[http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/ThematicMapFramesetServlet?_bm=y&amp;-tree_id=4001&amp;-_MapEvent=Pan&amp;-context=tm&amp;-errMsg=&amp;-all_geo_types=N&amp;-_useSS=N&amp;-_dBy=140&amp;-redoLog=false&amp;-_zoomLevel=&amp;-tm_name=DEC_2000_SF1_U_M00083&amp;-tm_config=|b=50|l=en|t=4001|zf=0.0|ms=thm_def|dw=0.127654448550011|dh=0.07576475132991932|dt=gov.census.aff.domain.map.EnglishMapExtent|if=gif|cx=-122.18653389899086|cy=37.84539209943137|zl=4|pz=4|bo=|bl=|ft=350:349:335:389:388:332:331|fl=403:381:204:380:369:379:368|g=05000US06001|ds=DEC_2000_SF1_U|sb=50|tud=false|db=140|mn=0.6|mx=79.2|cc=1|cm=1|cn=5|cb=|um=Percent|pr=1|th=DEC_2000_SF1_U_M00083|sf=N|sg=&amp;-PANEL_ID=tm_result&amp;-_pageY=&amp;-_lang=en&amp;-_pageX=&amp;-geo_id=05000US06001&amp;-_mapY=&amp;-_mapX=&amp;-_latitude=&amp;-_pan=SW&amp;-ds_name=DEC_2000_SF1_U&amp;-_longitude=&amp;-_changeMap=Identify#?67,251] &lt;!-- Notice the small grey sliver on Alameda Point; it is part of San Francisco.--&gt;

== Transportation ==
Vehicle access to the island is via three bridges to Oakland, a bridge for vehicular traffic as well as a second, pedestrian/bicycle-only drawbridge (the only one in the USA&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acgov.org/pwa/dept_maintenance_operation_bay_farm_island_bicycle_bridge.shtml|title=Maintenance and Operations Department|publisher=Alameda County Public Works Agency|accessdate=February 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acgov.org/pwa/dept_maintenance_operation_bay_farm_island_bicycle_bridge.shtml] Alameda County Government website&lt;/ref&gt; to Bay Farm Island, and two one-way tunnels leading into Oakland's Chinatown. Bridges at Fruitvale Avenue, High Street, and Park Street, and the tunnels at Webster Street and Harrison Street (the latter called the [[Posey Tube]]) connect Alameda and Oakland. Public transportation includes the [[AC Transit]] buses (which include express buses to San Francisco) and two ferry services ‚Äî the [http://www.eastbayferry.com/ Alameda-Oakland Ferry] and the [http://www.alamedaharborbayferry.com/ Harbor Bay Ferry].  Both ferry services may soon be transferred to the [http://www.watertransit.org/ Water Transit Authority]. The island is also close to the [[BART]] train service, with the closest stations being Lake Merritt, near the exit to the Posey Tube, and Fruitvale, near the Fruitvale Bridge.

Even though the island is just minutes off [[Interstate 880]], the speed limit for the city is 25&amp;nbsp;mph (40&amp;nbsp;km/h) on almost every road. Many unaware drivers fail to slow down after exiting the highway. Groups like Pedestrian Friendly Alameda and BikeAlameda advocate stronger enforcement of speeding laws.

Alameda has also featured prominently on automotive [[blog]] [[Jalopnik]], with their &quot;Down on The Street&quot; segment consisting of cars found on the streets of Alameda. Jalopnik has nicknamed it &quot;The Island That Rust Forgot&quot;.

== Attractions ==
[[Image:Vichouse.jpg|thumb|Victorian house in Alameda]]Due to its proximity to the Bay, [[windsurfing|wind surfers]] and [[kite surfing|kite surfers]] can often be seen along Crown Memorial State Beach and Shoreline Drive. From the beach there are also views of the San Francisco skyline and the San Francisco ‚Äì Oakland Bay Bridge.

One of the recent attractions is the [[aircraft carrier]] [[USS Hornet (CV-12)|''USS Hornet'']], a [[museum ship]] now moored at the former Naval Air Station as the [[USS Hornet Museum|USS ''Hornet'' Museum]]. This ship was originally named the ''USS Kearsarge'', but was renamed in honor of the previous Hornet CV-8 (famous for the [[Doolittle raid]]), which was lost in October 1942.

Alameda is known for its [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] houses; 9% of all single-family houses (1500) in Alameda are Victorian, and many more have been divided into two to four-unit dwellings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eastbayexpress.com/bestof/award.php?oid=oid:18492&amp;section=oid:17192&amp;year=2002 East Bay Express | Page not found&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; It is said that Alameda has more pre-1906 earthquake era homes than any other city in the Bay Area.

Alameda is home to the official offices and training facility of the [[Oakland Raiders]] [[American football]] team, which is located on Bay Farm Island. The facility is also home to [[The Raider Image]], the merchandise arm of the franchise, which the public can visit.

At the turn of the 19th century, the city of Alameda took a large chunk of Charles Froling's land away to build a street. Froling had planned to build his dream house on the plot of land he received through inheritance.&lt;ref name=&quot;neighbor&quot;&gt;Rubin, Sylvia. (January 7, 1988) [[San Francisco Chronicle]] ''Neighbor against neighbor; Mediators can resolve disputes.'' Section: People, Page B3.&lt;/ref&gt; To spite the city and an unsympathetic neighbor, Froling built a house {{convert|10|ft|m}} wide, {{convert|54|ft|m}} long and {{convert|20|ft|m}} high on the tiny strip of land left to him.&lt;ref name=&quot;neighbor&quot;/&gt; The Froling [[spite house]] is still standing and occupied.&lt;ref name=&quot;neighbor&quot;/&gt;

Alameda is also known for its Fourth of July parade. It features homemade floats, classic cars, motorized living room furniture, fire-breathing dragons, marching bands, and large crowds. The parade route is about 3 miles (5&amp;nbsp;km) long.

== Economic development ==
The [[Naval Air Station Alameda]] (NAS) was decommissioned and is in process of being turned over to the City of Alameda for civilian development. The area of the former NAS is now known as Alameda Point. Portions of this area are now in commercial use, but the transfer process has been slowed down by disputes between the Navy and the city regarding payment for environmental cleanup of the land. In late July 2006, the City of Alameda announced a deal with the Navy that would turn the land over to the city for $108M. The preliminary development concept calls for 1700 housing units to be developed at Alameda Point.

In September 2006, the developer, Alameda Point Community Partners, withdrew from development of Alameda Point. In May 2007, the City selected the SunCal Companies as the Master Developer of Alameda Point and, in July 2007, the parties were negotiating terms for a development agreement.  In August 2010, the Alameda City Council voted unanimously to deny SunCal's development proposal for Alameda Point. Many reasons were cited in the staff report including a developer-initiated ballot measure that was defeated in February 2010 by a margin of 85%

After two previous failures, voters in the city passed a ballot measure in 2000 authorizing a [[bond measure]] for construction of a new library to replace the city's [[Carnegie library]], damaged during the [[Loma Prieta earthquake]]. The city also received state funds for the new library and opened the doors to the new facility in November 2006.

[[Celera Corporation|Celera]], [[UTStarcom]] and BioTime are among the companies based in Alameda.

===America's Cup ===
The 33rd [[America's Cup]] Race was won by Golden Gate Yacht Club racing team BMW Oracle, founded by [[Larry Ellison]]. One possible use of the air station would be an alternate or partnered site with San Francisco for [[34th America's Cup]].
Within 2 weeks of the [http://www.ggyc.org Golden Gate Yacht Club] winning the America's Cup,  [http://alamedawaterfront.com/alameda-locals-and-city-start-americas-cup-campaign Alameda city council with local support] sent a unanimous letter of support to hold AC 34 in San Francisco Bay Area.

===Wine and spirits production===
Rosenblum Cellars Winery and St. George Spirits are located at Alameda Point. In 1978, Alameda veterinarian Dr. Kent Rosenblum and his wife Kathy founded Rosenblum Cellars. In 2008, the company was purchased by [[Diageo]] Estates.

In December, 2007, St. George Absinthe Verte, produced by St. George Spirits became the first brand of American-made [[absinthe]] to be legally produced in the United States since a ban was enacted in 1912.

===Theaters===
[[Image:Alameda Theater.jpg|thumb|right|220px|The [[Alameda Theatre]] in 2006 prior to expansion and restoration]]
City officials continue to seek ways to spur economic development on the island, including the restoration of the historic [[Art Deco]] city landmark [[Alameda Theatre]]. The theater restoration project included a multiplex to make the project financially feasible and a parking structure to accommodate patrons of the theater and avoid excessive impact on parking in the Park Street area. Following some setbacks during construction the public opening was May 21, 2008, with a gala event.

The South Shore Mall Twin Cinema opened in 1969 and served as a prominent theater on the island until its closure in 1998. In 2002, the building was demolished and its former site is now a parking lot in the Alameda Towne Centre shopping mall (formerly South Shore Center).

Alameda also had one other operating movie theater, Central Cinema. The theater opened in December 2004 and closed in June 2008. It was a 42-seat house at 842 Central Avenue (near the western end of Webster Street). The building had previously been both a community center and a mortuary, and the operator of the movie theater was able to use a quirk of the site zoning to legally operate a movie theater. The theatre had only one screen, but featured couches and armchairs for seating.

==Local newspapers and magazines==
Alameda's first newspaper, the ''Encinal'', appeared in the early 1850s and the paper's editor was instrumental in the movement to incorporate the city. Following the ''Encinal'', several other papers appeared along geographic lines, and the ''Daily Argus'' eventually rose to prominence. A young Alameda native, [[Joseph R. Knowland]], wrote political and historical articles for the Alameda papers. Later, Knowland owned the powerful ''[[Oakland Tribune]]''. Around 1900, the ''Daily Argus'' began to fade in importance and east and west papers ''The Times'' and ''The Star'' combined to take the leading role as the ''Alameda Times-Star'' in the 1930s. The ''Times-Star'' was sold to the [[Alameda Newspaper Group]] in the 1970s.

In 1997, the Hills Newspaper chain was bought by [[Knight Ridder]], at the time, the second-largest newspaper chain in the U.S. Following the buyout, former Hills Newspapers employees recognized the lack of a local community voice in Alameda, and again formed a new locally-based newspaper, the ''Alameda Sun'', in 2001. In 2006, Knight Ridder announced its impending sale to [[The McClatchy Company|McClatchy Corp.]], a Sacramento-based publishing firm. McClatchy Corp. has put the ''Contra Costa Times'', which under the Knight Ridder reorganization included all five of the original Hills Newspapers, up for sale. The current owners of the ''Alameda Times-Star'', [[MediaNews Group|MediaNews, Inc.]], based in [[Colorado]], have announced a strong interest in buying both the ''Contra Costa Times'' chain and the ''[[San Jose Mercury News]]'', consolidating the daily newspaper market of the East Bay, effectively under one owner.

The Alameda community is currently served by two weekly newspapers, the Alameda Journal, owned by the MediaNews Group, and the Alameda Sun.

==Alameda Municipal Power==
Unlike surrounding communities, Alameda has a municipal power service, [[Alameda Municipal Power]] (AMP), that delivers services directly to consumers. AMP sold the majority of its telecommunications business to [[Comcast]] in 2008 but continues to provide telecommunication service at Alameda Point.

During the [[California electricity crisis]] of 2000 and 2001, Alameda Municipal Power did not raise electricity rates, while residents in most of the state endured significant price increases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mindfully.org/Energy/Alameda-Produces-Energy.htm] Alameda Produces Its Own Energy Island residents sustain low rates SF Chronicle, Jan 13, 2001 (archived)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arts and culture==
{{Ref improve section|date=August 2007}}
The [[Alameda Arts Council]] (AAC) serves as the local Alameda City [[arts council]].

'''The Alameda Museum''', on Alameda Avenue near Park Street, features displays on the history of Alameda.  There is also an active monthly lecture series on topics of local interest.

'''Alameda Women Artists''' holds yearly shows at the Alameda Museum and has many active artists exhibiting around the Island City.

'''Rhythmix Cultural Works''', founded by Janet Koike, is located on Blanding Avenue. It is a combination live/work studio, gallery, and performance space and has hosted events from musical and theatrical productions to religious services and birthday parties. According to Rhythmix' web site, &quot;Rhythmix Cultural Works (RCW) opened its doors (on June 2), 2007. The 501(c) (3) was established in 1999 as the umbrella for RhythMix world music ensemble and RCW cultural exchange programs. From 1999-2002, RCW coordinated six successful cultural exchange trips to Cuba and Japan. During this same period, the RhythMix ensemble (now Maze Daiko) reached thousands of children through San Francisco Symphony Adventures in Music, Young Audiences and Bread &amp; Roses programs. Inspired by these experiences, Artistic Director-Janet Koike, spent five years renovating an industrial space in Alameda to provide a home for RCW...&quot;

'''The Frank Bette Center for the Arts''' defines its mission as &quot;... a place for meetings, readings, showings, and other creative doings,&quot; based on the late artist/poet Frank Bette's intention to have his home become an art center after his death. The FBCA offers classes, poetry reading events, and a rotating &quot;Endless Call for Art&quot; that encourages creatives of many disciplines to display and market their work. Events and classes include figure drawing, watercolor, beading, photography, Artist Trading Card swaps, poetry for teens, poetry readings and slams, and more.  The FBCA is home to an annual &quot;Plein Air Paint-Out&quot; hosting plein-air artists from all over the world, who are invited to paint outdoors in Alameda's amazing range of light and temperate climate. The FBCA is also home to the West Coast's only regularly scheduled Body Art Jam. Professional and amateur body artists - including body painters and henna artists -  from all over the San Francisco Bay Area come to practice and share knowledge at these jams, held the 2nd Wednesday monthly.

'''The Alameda Art Association''' has about 80 members as of January 2011, and has a gallery space at Alameda Towne Centre mall. The Association began in 1944.

'''Bridgehead Studios''', located on Blanding Avenue, hosts the monthly Estuary Art Attack gallery crawl on the second Friday of every month. Helmed by photographer Chuck diGuida, Bridghead Studios is housed in a repurposed propellor factory.  The facility is divided into small and large studio spaces used by photographers, artists, fashion designers, and at one time, a shark-diving expedition company.

The annual benefit, '''Circus for Arts in the Schools''', is held at Kofman Auditorium on Central Avenue. The brain child of acclaimed clown Jeff Raz, this circus is a professional-level display of humor, silliness, skilled movement, and acrobatics that has delighted audiences since its first performance in April 2004. The Circus has raised thousands of dollars to bring teaching artists into classrooms in the Alameda Unified School District.

'''Pacific Pinball Museum''' is a nonprofit center on Webster Street, dedicated to teaching about the art, science, and joy of pinball. www.pacificpinball.org

Alameda has been home to many movie sets. Some of the movies filmed on the island have included ''[[Bicentennial Man]]'', ''[[The Net (film)|The Net]]'', ''The Matrix Reloaded'', ''[[The Matrix: Revolutions]]'', ''[[Bee Season]]'', the original 1968 ''Your, Mine and Ours'' and the movie musical ''[[Rent (film)|Rent]]''. Parts of Alameda High School were animated for the ''[[Animatrix]]'' episode &quot;Kid's Story&quot;. A massive hangar at the former Naval Air Station Alameda was used to film special scenes requiring [[computer-generated imagery]] for movies such as ''Bicentennial Man'', ''[[Flubber (film)|Flubber]]'', ''[[What Dreams May Come (film)|What Dreams May Come]]'', ''[[Mission: Impossible II]]'' and many scenes from the ''[[The Matrix|Matrix]]'' trilogy, including the signature [[bullet time]] scene. The open space of the decommissioned naval base often hosts ''[[MythBusters]]''' more dangerous experiments.

Photo-realist [[Robert Bechtle]] has painted numerous Alameda subjects, including &quot;Alameda Gran Torino,&quot; which was acquired by [[SFMOMA]] in 1974 and remains one of Bechtle's most famous works.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfmoma.org/artwork/3509 SFMOMA | Explore Modern Art | Our Collection | Robert Bechtle | Alameda Gran Torino&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Alameda was briefly the home of [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]. Benjamin Reed's novel ''The Bow Tie Gang''&lt;ref&gt;[http://austinist.com/2005/11/09/wine_time_with_austin_author_ben_reed.php Austinist.com Interviews Ben Reed]&lt;/ref&gt; takes place almost entirely in Alameda circa 1961.

The [[Alameda Civic Light Opera]], which performed [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]-style musical productions was founded in 1996.  It closed in 2010.

===The Altarena Playhouse===
The Altarena Playhouse, which performs comedies, dramas and musicals, was founded in 1938 and is the longest continuously operating community theatre in the San Francisco Bay Area.

===Dance Arts Project===
The [[Dance Arts Project]] was founded by noted instructor and choreographer Michaela Lynch and has offered classes and performance opportunities for Alameda's children for more than a decade. Still under the direction of Ms. Lynch, the Dance Arts Project has become a fixture in the community and the premier locality for performance arts training in Alameda.In 1992, Miss Michaela Lynch debuted Dance Arts Project at Harbor Bay Club in Alameda. In that first year, the school had one teacher and an enrollment of 50 dancers. With those 50 students, in July 1993, Dance Arts Project had its grand opening on Chestnut Street, where it still operates today.
Dance Arts Project has always offered ballet, children‚Äôs creative movement and modern dance. Recently, we‚Äôve added classes in ballroom dance.
In 2002, Dance Arts Project expanded its facility to include a second studio, Deux.
Today, Dance Arts Project has six teachers working with hundreds of dancers every day, inspiring and encouraging self-esteem, creativity and the love of dance.

===Sister cities===
Since 2004, Alameda participates in a [[sister city]] agreement with [[Wuxi]], China. Also, the city participates in a sister city with [[Arita, Saga|Arita]], Japan.

Another sister city is [[Liding√∂]], Sweden. The initiative came from Alameda in 1959 and was part of [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|President Eisenhower's]] [[People to People International|people-to-people-movement]], whose purpose was to develop better understanding among people from different countries after World War II. Both Alameda and Liding√∂ are islands with a bridge connecting them to a big city.

===Festivals on Webster Street===
Webster Street in Alameda has long been the host of many arts, crafts and holiday festivals. During these festivals the city of Alameda will block of a portion of Webster St. for the entertainment of festival goers. Festivals such as the [http://westalamedabusiness.com/events/ Peanut Butter Jam Festival] brings a lot of local and outside visitors to Alameda to enjoy the fun, food and games.

{{Main|Alameda Unified School District}}
Like almost all cities in California, the municipal government and the school administration are two separate entities. The [[Alameda Unified School District]] has the same boundaries as the City of Alameda, but has a separately elected board to oversee its operations, and its funding comes directly from the county and state governments without oversight by the city council. The AUSD abuses approximately 10,000 students each year, in eight [[elementary school]]s, three [[middle school]]s, two traditional high schools, three alternative learning schools including  [[Alameda Community Learning Center|ACLC]], one [[continuation school]] - Island High, and one high school within the College of Alameda. Most high school students attend [[Encinal High]] or [[Alameda High]]. The district also operates an Adult School and a Child Development Center. Two elementary schools were closed at the end of the 2005‚Äì2006 school year. However, a new elementary school, [[Ruby Bridges]], opened for the 2006‚Äì2007 school year.

A common motif in the [[secondary structure]] of [[protein]]s, the '''alpha helix (Œ±-helix)''' is a right-handed coiled or spiral conformation, in which every backbone [[amino|N-H]] group donates a [[hydrogen bond]] to the backbone [[carbonyl|C=O]] group of the [[amino acid]] four [[residue (chemistry)|residues]] earlier (&lt;math&gt;i+4 \rightarrow i&lt;/math&gt; hydrogen bonding). This secondary structure is also sometimes called a classic '''Pauling-Corey-Branson''' alpha helix (see below).  Among types of local structure in proteins, the Œ±-helix is the most regular and the most predictable from sequence, as well as the most prevalent.

==Historical development==

In the early 1930s, [[William Astbury]] showed that there were drastic changes in the [[X-ray]] [[fiber diffraction]] of moist wool or hair fibers upon significant stretching. The data suggested that the unstretched fibers had a coiled molecular structure with a characteristic repeat of ~{{convert|5.1|√Ö|nm}}.  

Astbury initially proposed a kinked-chain structure for the fibers. He later joined other researchers (notably the American chemist Maurice Huggins) in proposing that: 

*the unstretched protein molecules formed a helix (which he called the Œ±-form); and

*the stretching caused the helix to uncoil, forming an extended state (which he called the Œ≤-form).
Although incorrect in their details, Astbury's models of these forms were correct in essence and correspond to modern elements of [[secondary structure]], the Œ±-helix and the [[Beta sheet|Œ≤-strand]] (Astbury's nomenclature was kept), which were developed by [[Linus Pauling]], [[Robert Corey]] and [[Herman Branson]] in 1951 (see below); that paper showed both right- and left-handed helices, although in 1960 the crystal structure of myoglobin&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Kendrew | first = JC | authorlink = John Kendrew | last2 = Dickerson | year = 1960 | first2 = RE | last3 = Strandberg | first3 = BE | last4 = Hart | first4 = RG | last5 = Davies | first5 = DR | last6 = Phillips | first6 = DC | last7 = Shore | first7 = VC | title = Structure of myoglobin: A three-dimensional Fourier synthesis at 2 √Ö resolution | journal = Nature | volume = 185 | issue = 4711 | pages = 422&amp;ndash;427 | doi = 10.1038/185422a0 | pmid = 18990802 }}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that the right-handed form is the common one. [[Hans Neurath]] was the first to show that Astbury's models could not be correct in detail, because they involved clashes of atoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Neurath | first = H | authorlink = Hans Neurath | year = 1940 | title = Intramolecular folding of polypeptide chains in relation to protein structure | journal = Journal of Physical Chemistry | volume = 44 | pages = 296&amp;ndash;305 | doi = 10.1021/j150399a003 | issue = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is interesting to note that Neurath's paper and Astbury's data inspired [[Hugh Stott Taylor|H. S. Taylor]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Taylor | first = HS | authorlink = Hugh Stott Taylor | year = 1942 | title = Large molecules through atomic spectacles | journal = Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society | volume = 85 | pages = 1&amp;ndash;12}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maurice Loyal Huggins|Maurice Huggins]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Huggins | first = M | authorlink = Maurice Loyal Huggins | year = 1943 | title = The structure of fibrous proteins | journal = Chemical Reviews | volume = 32 | pages = 195&amp;ndash;218 | doi = 10.1021/cr60102a002 | issue = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[William Lawrence Bragg|Bragg]] and collaborators&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Bragg | first = WL | authorlink = William Lawrence Bragg | coauthors = [[John Kendrew|Kendrew JC]], [[Max Perutz|Perutz MF]] | year = 1950 | title = Polypeptide chain configurations in crystalline proteins | journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society a | volume = 203 | pages = 321&amp;ndash;? | doi = 10.1098/rspa.1950.0142 | issue = 1074}}&lt;/ref&gt; to propose models of [[keratin]] that somewhat resemble the modern Œ±-helix.

Two key developments in the modeling of the modern Œ±-helix were (1) the correct bond geometry, thanks to the [[crystallography|crystal structure determinations]] of [[amino acid]]s and [[peptide]]s and Pauling's prediction of ''planar'' [[peptide bond]]s; and (2) his relinquishing of the assumption of an integral number of residues per turn of the helix.  The pivotal moment came in the early spring of 1948, when Pauling caught a cold and went to bed. Being bored, he drew a polypeptide chain of roughly correct dimensions on a strip of paper and folded it into a helix, being careful to maintain the planar peptide bonds. After a few attempts, he produced a model with physically plausible hydrogen bonds. Pauling then worked with Corey and Branson to confirm his model before publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Pauling | first = L | authorlink = Linus Pauling | coauthors = [[Robert Corey|Corey RB]], [[Herman Branson|Branson HR]] | year = 1951 | title = The Structure of Proteins: Two Hydrogen-Bonded Helical Configurations of the Polypeptide Chain | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Science in Washington | volume = 37 | issue = 4 | pages = 205&amp;ndash;211 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.37.4.205 | pmc = 1063337 | pmid = 14816373 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1954 Pauling was awarded his first Nobel Prize &quot;for his research into the nature of the chemical bond and its application to the elucidation of the structure of complex substances&quot;[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1954/] (such as proteins), prominently including the structure of the Œ±-helix.

[[Image:alpha helix neg60 neg45 topview.png|thumb|right|200px|Top view of the same helix shown above. Four [[carbonyl]] groups are pointing upwards towards the viewer, spaced roughly 100¬∞ apart on the circle, corresponding to 3.6 [[amino acid|amino-acid]] residues per turn of the helix.]]

==Structure==
===Geometry and hydrogen bonding===

The amino acids in an Œ± helix are arranged in a right-handed [[helix|helical]] structure where each amino acid residue corresponds to a 100¬∞ turn in the helix (i.e., the helix has 3.6 residues per turn), and a translation of {{convert|1.5|√Ö|nm|abbr=on}} along the helical axis. Dunitz&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Dunitz | first = J | authorlink = Jack Dunitz | year = 2001 | title = Pauling's Left-Handed Œ±-Helix | journal = Angewandte Chemie International Edition | volume = 40 | pages = 4167&amp;ndash;4173 | doi = 10.1002/1521-3773(20011119)40:22&lt;4167::AID-ANIE4167&gt;3.0.CO;2-Q | issue = 22}}&lt;/ref&gt; describes how Pauling's first article on the theme in fact shows a left-handed helix, the enantiomer of the true structure. Short pieces of left-handed helix sometimes occur with a large content of achiral [[glycine]] amino acids, but are unfavorable for the other normal, biological [[amino acids|L-amino acids]]. The pitch of the alpha-helix (the vertical distance between one consecutive turn of the helix) is {{convert|5.4|√Ö|nm|abbr=on}} which is the product of 1.5 and 3.6. What is most important is that the [[amine|N-H]] group of an amino acid forms a [[hydrogen bond]] with the [[carbonyl|C=O]] group of the amino acid ''four'' residues earlier; this repeated &lt;math&gt;i+4 \rightarrow i&lt;/math&gt; hydrogen bonding is the most prominent characteristic of an Œ±-helix. Official international nomenclature&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = IUPAC-IUB Commission on Biochemical Nomenclature | year = 1970 | title = Abbreviations and symbols for the description of the conformation of polypeptide chains | journal = Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 245 | pages = 6489‚Äì6497}}&lt;/ref&gt; [http://www.chem.qmul.ac.uk/iupac/misc/ppep1.html] specifies two ways of defining Œ±-helices, rule 6.2 in terms of repeating œÜ,œà torsion angles (see below) and rule 6.3 in terms of the combined pattern of pitch and hydrogen bonding.  The alpha-helices can be identified in protein structure using several computational methods, one of which is [[DSSP (protein)|DSSP]] (Dictionary of Protein [[Secondary structure|Secondary Structure]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Kabsch | first = K | coauthors = Sander C | year = 1983 | title = Identification of structural motifs from protein coordinate data: secondary structure and first-level supersecondary structure | journal = Biopolymers | volume = 22 | pages = 2577‚Äì2637 | doi = 10.1002/bip.360221211 | pmid = 6667333 | issue = 12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Alpha vs 310 helix end views.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Contrast of helix end views between Œ± (squarish) vs 3-10 (triangular)]]
Similar structures include the 3&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; helix (&lt;math&gt;i+3 \rightarrow i&lt;/math&gt; hydrogen bonding) and the œÄ-helix (&lt;math&gt;i+5 \rightarrow i&lt;/math&gt; hydrogen bonding). The Œ± helix can be described as a 3.6&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt; helix, since the i + 4 spacing adds 3 more atoms to the H-bonded loop compared to the tighter 3&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; helix. The subscripts refer to the number of atoms (including the hydrogen) in the closed loop formed by the hydrogen bond.&lt;ref name=&quot;Anatax&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last = Richardson | first = JS | authorlink = Jane Richardson |  year = 1981 | title = The Anatomy and Taxonomy of Proteins | journal = Advances in Protein Chemistry | volume = 34 | pages = 167&amp;ndash;339 [http://kinemage.biochem.duke.edu/teaching/Anatax/] | doi = 10.1016/S0065-3233(08)60520-3 | pmid=7020376}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Ramachandran plot general 100K.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Ramachandran diagram (œÜ,œà plot), with data points for Œ±-helical residues forming a dense diagonal cluster below and left of center, around the global energy minimum for backbone conformation.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | author = Lovell SC et al. | title = Structure validation by CŒ± geometry: œÜ,œà and CŒ≤ deviation | journal = Proteins | volume = 50 | pages = 437‚Äì450 | doi = 10.1002/prot.10286 | pmid = 12557186 | year = 2003 | issue = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Residues in Œ±-helices typically adopt backbone (œÜ, œà) [[dihedral angle]]s around (-60¬∞, -45¬∞), as shown in the image at right. In more general terms, they adopt dihedral angles such that the œà [[dihedral angle]] of one residue and the œÜ [[dihedral angle]] of the ''next'' residue sum to roughly -105¬∞. As a consequence, Œ±-helical dihedral angles, in general, fall on a diagonal stripe on the [[Ramachandran diagram]] (of slope -1), ranging from (-90¬∞, -15¬∞) to (-35¬∞, -70¬∞). For comparison, the sum of the dihedral angles for a 3&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; helix is roughly -75¬∞, whereas that for the œÄ-helix is roughly -130¬∞. The general formula for the rotation angle Œ© per residue of any polypeptide helix with ''trans'' isomers is given by the equation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite | last = Dickerson | first = RE | coauthors = [[Irving Geis|Geis I]] |  year = 1969 | title = Structure and Action of Proteins | publisher = Harper, New York }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
3 \cos \Omega = 1 - 4 \cos^{2} \left[\left(\phi + \psi \right)/2 \right]
&lt;/math&gt;

The Œ±-helix is tightly packed; there is almost no free space within the helix. The amino-acid side chains are on the outside of the helix, and point roughly &quot;downwards&quot; (i.e., towards the N-terminus), like the branches of an evergreen tree ([[Christmas tree]] effect). This directionality is sometimes used in preliminary, low-resolution electron-density maps to determine the direction of the protein backbone.

=== 2D (dimensional) diagrams for representing alpha-helices ===

Two different kinds of 2D diagrams are usually used to represent Œ±-helices. One is called the ‚Äú[[helical wheel]]‚Äù,&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid6048867&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Schiffer M, Edmundson AB | title = Use of helical wheels to represent the structures of proteins and to identify segments with helical potential | journal = Biophys.

In the wenxiang diagram each amino acid residue is represented by a circle with a letter to indicate its single character code: a hydrophobic residue is denoted by a filled circle with a white code symbol, whereas a hydrophilic residue is denoted by an open circle with a black code symbol. As a 2D representation, the wenxiang diagram has the following features: (1) able to show the relative locations of the amino acids in an alpha-helix regardless how long it is;  (2) able to indicate the direction of an alpha-helix; and (3) having the capacity to provide more information about each of the constituent amino acid residues in an Œ±-helix.   With these features, the wenxiang diagram can provides an easily visualizable picture in a 2D space that characterizes the disposition of hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues in Œ±-helices, and are particularly useful for studying amphiphilic helices in proteins.&lt;ref name=chou/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid20202472&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kurochkina N | title = Helix-helix interactions and their impact on protein motifs and assemblies | journal = J.

=== Stability ===

Helices observed in proteins can range from four to over forty residues long, but a typical helix contains about ten amino acids (about three turns). In general, short [[polypeptide]]s do not exhibit much alpha helical structure in solution, since the [[entropy|entropic]] cost associated with the folding of the polypeptide chain is not compensated for by a sufficient amount of stabilizing interactions. In general, the backbone [[hydrogen bond]]s of Œ±-helices are considered slightly weaker than those found in [[beta sheet|Œ≤-sheets]], and are readily attacked by the ambient water molecules. However, in more hydrophobic environments such as the [[cellular membrane|plasma membrane]], or in the presence of co-solvents such as [[trifluoroethanol]] (TFE), or isolated from solvent in the gas phase,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Hudgins | first = RR | coauthors = Jarrold MF | year = 1999 | title = Helix Formation in Unsolvated Alanine-Based Peptides: Helical Monomers and Helical Dimers | journal = Journal of the American Chemical Society | volume = 121 | pages = 3494&amp;ndash;3501 | doi = 10.1021/ja983996a | issue = 14}}&lt;/ref&gt; oligopeptides readily adopt stable Œ±-helical structure.  Furthermore, crosslinks can be incorporated into peptides to conformationally stabilize helical folds.  Crosslinks stabilize the helical state by entropically destabilizing the unfolded state and by removing enthalpically stabilized &quot;decoy&quot; folds that compete with the fully helical state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Kutchukian | first = PS | coauthors = Yang JS, Verdine GL, Shakhnovich EI | year = 2009 | title = All-Atom Model for Stabilization of alpha-Helical Structure in Peptides by Hydrocarbon Staples | journal = Journal of the American Chemical Society | pmid = 19334772 | volume = 131 | issue = 13 | pmc = 2735086 | pages = 4622&amp;ndash;4627 | doi = 10.1021/ja805037p}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

[[Image:Helix electron density myoglobin 2nrl 17-32.jpg|thumb|right|200px|An Œ±-helix in ultra-high-resolution electron density contours, with O atoms in red, N atoms in blue, and hydrogen bonds as green dotted lines (PDB file 2NRL, 17-32). The N-terminus is at the top, here.]]

== Experimental determination ==

Since the Œ±-helix is defined by its hydrogen bonds and backbone conformation, the most detailed experimental evidence for  Œ±-helical structure comes from atomic-resolution [[X-ray crystallography]] such as the example shown at right.  It is clear that all the backbone carbonyl oxygens point downward (toward the C-terminus) but splay out slightly, and the H-bonds are approximately parallel to the helix axis. Protein structures from [[protein NMR|NMR spectroscopy]] also show helices well, with characteristic observations of NOE ([[Nuclear Overhauser Effect]]) couplings between atoms on adjacent helical turns. In some cases, the individual hydrogen bonds can be observed directly as a small scalar coupling in NMR.  

There are several lower-resolution methods for assigning general helical structure. The [[protein NMR|NMR]] [[chemical shift]]s (in particular of the &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{C^{\alpha}}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{C^{\beta}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{C'}&lt;/math&gt; atoms) and [[residual dipolar coupling]]s are often characteristic of helices. The far-UV (170-250&amp;nbsp;nm) [[circular dichroism]] spectrum of helices is also idiosyncratic, exhibiting a pronounced double minimum at ~208&amp;nbsp;nm and ~222&amp;nbsp;nm. [[Infrared]] spectroscopy is rarely used, since the Œ±-helical spectrum resembles that of a [[random coil]] (although these might be discerned by, e.g., [[hydrogen-deuterium exchange]]). Finally, cryo [[electron microscopy]] is now capable of discerning individual Œ±-helices within a protein, although their assignment to residues is still an active area of research.

Long homopolymers of amino acids often form helices if soluble. Such long, isolated helices can also be detected by other methods, such as [[dielectric relaxation]], [[flow birefringence]] and measurements of the [[diffusion constant]]. In stricter terms, these methods detect only the characteristic [[prolate]] (long cigar-like) hydrodynamic shape of a helix, or its large [[Molecular dipole moment|dipole moment]].

== Amino-acid propensities ==

Different amino-acid sequences have different propensities for forming Œ±-helical structure. [[Methionine]], [[alanine]], [[leucine]], uncharged [[glutamate]], and [[lysine]] (&quot;MALEK&quot; in the [[amino-acid]] 1-letter codes) all have especially high helix-forming propensities, whereas [[proline]] and [[glycine]] have poor helix-forming propensities.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid9649402&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Pace CN, Scholtz JM | title = A helix propensity scale based on experimental studies of peptides and proteins | journal = Biophys. J. | volume = 75 | issue = 1 | pages = 422‚Äì7 | year = 1998 | month = July | pmid = 9649402 | pmc = 1299714 | doi = 10.1016/S0006-3495(98)77529-0 | url = | issn = | bibcode=1998BpJ....75..422N}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Proline]] either breaks or kinks a helix, both because it cannot donate an amide [[hydrogen bond]] (having no amide hydrogen), and also because its sidechain interferes sterically with the backbone of the preceding turn - inside a helix, this forces a bend of about 30¬∞ in the helix axis.&lt;ref name=&quot;Anatax&quot;/&gt; However, proline is often seen as the ''first'' residue of a helix, presumably due to its structural rigidity. At the other extreme, [[glycine]] also tends to disrupt helices because its high conformational flexibility makes it entropically expensive to adopt the relatively constrained Œ±-helical structure.

== Dipole moment ==

A helix has an overall [[Molecular dipole moment|dipole moment]] caused by the aggregate effect of all the individual dipoles from the [[carbonyl]] groups of the peptide bond pointing along the helix axis. This can lead to destabilization of the helix through entropic effects. As a result, Œ± helices are often capped at the N-terminal end by a negatively charged [[amino acid]], such as [[glutamic acid]], in order to Neutralize this helix dipole. Less common (and less effective) is C-terminal capping with a positively charged amino acid, such as [[lysine]]. The N-terminal positive charge is commonly used to bind negatively charged ligands such as phosphate groups, which is especially effective because the backbone amides can serve as hydrogen bond donors.

== Larger-scale assemblies ==

[[Image:1GZX Haemoglobin.png|thumb|right|200px|The [[Hemoglobin]] molecule has four heme-binding subunits, each largely made of alpha helices.]]
[[Myoglobin]] and [[hemoglobin]], the first two proteins whose structures were solved by X-ray [[crystallography]], have very similar folds made up of about 70% Œ± helix, with the rest being non-repetitive regions, or &quot;loops&quot; which connect the helices. In classifying proteins by their dominant fold, the [http://scop.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/scop/ Structural Classification of Proteins] database maintains a large category specifically for all-Œ± proteins. 

Coiled-coil Œ± helices are highly stable forms in which two or more helices wrap around each other in a &quot;supercoil&quot; structure. [[Coiled coil]]s contain a highly characteristic sequence motif known as a '''[[heptad repeat]]''', in which the motif repeats itself every seven residues along the sequence. The first and especially the fourth residues (known as the ''a'' and ''d'' positions) are almost always [[hydrophobic]] (the fourth residue is typically [[leucine]]) and pack together in the interior of the helix bundle. In general, the fifth and seventh residues (the ''e'' and ''g'' positions) have opposing charges and form a salt bridge stabilized by [[electrostatic]] interactions. [[Fibrous protein]]s such as keratin and myosin often adopt coiled-coil structures, as do several dimerizing proteins. A pair of coiled-coils - a [[helix bundle|four-helix bundle]] - is a very common structural motif in proteins. For example, it occurs in human [[growth hormone]] and several varieties of [[cytochrome]]. The Rop protein, which promotes plasmid replication in bacteria, is an interesting case in which a single polypeptide forms a coiled-coil and two monomers assemble to form a four-helix bundle.

The amino acids that make up a particular helix can be plotted on a [[helical wheel]], a representation that illustrates the orientations of the constituent amino acids. Often in [[globular protein]]s, as well as in specialized structures such as coiled-coils and [[leucine zipper]]s, an alpha helix will exhibit two &quot;faces&quot; - one containing predominantly [[hydrophobic]] amino acids oriented toward the interior of the protein, in the [[hydrophobic core]], and one containing predominantly [[polarity (chemistry)|polar]] amino acids oriented toward the [[solvent]]-exposed surface of the protein.

== Functional roles ==

[[Image:1gzm opm.gif|thumb|right|200px|Bovine rhodopsin (PDB file 1GZM), with a bundle of seven helices crossing the membrane (membrane surfaces marked by horizontal lines)]]

===DNA binding===

Œ±-helices have particular significance in [[DNA]] binding motifs, including [[helix-turn-helix]] motifs, [[leucine zipper]] motifs and [[zinc finger]] motifs. This is because of the convenient structural fact that the diameter of the Œ± helix is 1.2 nanometres, the same as the width of the major groove in B-form [[DNA]], and also because [[coiled-coil]] (or leucine zipper) dimers of helices can readily position a pair of interaction surfaces to contact the sort of symmetrical repeat common in double-helical DNA (see Branden &amp; Tooze, chapter 10).  An example of both aspects is the [[transcription factor]] Max (see image at left), which uses a helical coiled-coil to dimerize, positioning another pair of helices for interaction in two successive turns of the DNA major groove.

=== Membrane spanning ===

Œ±-helices are also the most common protein structure element that crosses biological membranes (see Branden &amp; Tooze, chapter 12), it is presumed because the helical structure can satisfy all backbone hydrogen-bonds internally, leaving no polar groups exposed to the membrane if the sidechains are hydrophobic.  Proteins are sometimes anchored by a single membrane-spanning helix, sometimes by a pair, and sometimes by a helix bundle, most classically consisting of seven helices arranged up-and-down in a ring such as for [[rhodopsin]]s (see image at right) or for [[G protein‚Äìcoupled receptor]]s (GPCRs).

=== Mechanical properties ===

Œ±-helices under axial tensile deformation, a characteristic loading condition that appears in many alpha-helix rich filaments and tissues, results in a characteristic three-phase behavior of stiff-soft-stiff tangent modulus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = T. Ackbarow, X. Chen, S. Keten, M.J. Buehler | year = 2007 | title = Hierarchies, multiple energy barriers and robustness govern the fracture mechanics of alpha-helical and beta-sheet protein domains | journal = PNAS| volume = 104| pages = 16410‚Äì16415 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0705759104 | pmid = 17925444 | issue = 42 | pmc = 2034213 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Phase I corresponds to the small-deformation regime during which the helix is stretched homogeneously, followed by phase II in which alpha-helical turns break mediated by the rupture of groups of H-bonds. Phase III is typically associated with large-deformation covalent bond stretching.

== Dynamical features ==

Alpha-helices in proteins may have [[low-frequency collective motion in proteins and DNA|low-frequency]] accordion-like motion as observed by the [[Raman spectroscopy]]&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid7115900&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Painter PC, Mosher LE, Rhoads C | title = Low-frequency modes in the Raman spectra of proteins | journal = Biopolymers | volume = 21 | issue = 7 | pages = 1469‚Äì72 | year = 1982 | month = July | pmid = 7115900 | doi = 10.1002/bip.360210715 | url = | issn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and analyzed via the quasi-continuum model.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid6362659&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Chou KC | title = Identification of low-frequency modes in protein molecules | journal = Biochem.

== Helix-coil transition ==
{{see also|Helix-coil transition model}}

Homopolymers of amino-acids (such as [[poly-lysine]]) can adopt Œ±-helical structure at low temperature that is &quot;melted out&quot; at high temperatures. This '''helix-coil transition''' was once thought to be analogous to protein [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denaturation]]. The [[statistical mechanics]] of this transition can be modeled using an elegant [[transfer matrix]] method, characterized by two parameters: the propensity to initiate a helix and the propensity to extend a helix.

== The Œ±-helix in art ==

At least three artists have made explicit reference to the Œ±-helix in their work, Julie Newdoll in painting and [[Julian Voss-Andreae]] and [[Bathsheba Grossman]] in sculpture.

San Francisco area artist Julie Newdoll [http://www.newdoll.com/], who holds a degree in Microbiology, and a minor in art, has specialized in paintings inspired by microscopic images and molecules since 1990. Her painting &quot;Rise of the Alpha Helix&quot; (2003) features human figures arranged in an Œ± helical arrangement. According to the artist, &quot;the flowers reflect the various types of sidechains that each amino acid holds out to the world&quot;[http://www.newdoll.com/]. It is interesting to note that this same metaphor is also echoed from the scientist's side: &quot;Œ≤ sheets do not show a stiff repetitious regularity but flow in graceful, twisting curves, and even the Œ±-helix is regular more in the manner of a flower stem, whose branching nodes show the influence of environment, developmental history, and the evolution of each part to match its own idiosyncratic function.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Anatax&quot;/&gt;

The sculpture stands in front of Pauling's childhood home on 3945 SE Hawthorne Boulevard in [[Portland, Oregon]], USA).]]

[[Julian Voss-Andreae]] is a German-born sculptor with degrees in experimental physics and sculpture. Since 2001 Voss-Andreae creates &quot;protein sculptures&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Voss-Andreae| first = J | year = 2005 | title = Protein Sculptures: Life's Building Blocks Inspire Art | journal = Leonardo | volume = 38 | pages = 41&amp;ndash;45 | doi = 10.1162/leon.2005.38.1.41}}&lt;/ref&gt; based on protein structure with the Œ±-helix being one of his preferred objects. Voss-Andreae has made Œ±-helix sculptures from diverse materials including bamboo and whole trees. A monument Voss-Andreae created in 2004 to celebrate the memory of [[Linus Pauling]], the discoverer of the Œ±-helix, is fashioned from a large steel beam rearranged in the structure of the Œ±-helix. The {{convert|10|ft|0|adj=on}} tall, bright-red sculpture stands in front of Pauling's childhood home in [[Portland, Oregon]].

[[Ribbon diagrams]] of Œ±-helices are a prominent element in the laser-etched crystal sculptures of protein structures created by [[Bathsheba Grossman]] [http://www.bathsheba.com], such as those of [[insulin]], [[hemoglobin]], and [[DNA polymerase]].

'''Accrington''' is a town in [[Lancashire]], within the borough of [[Hyndburn]]. It lies about {{convert|4|mi|0}} east of [[Blackburn]], {{convert|6|mi|0}} west of [[Burnley]], {{convert|20|mi|0}} north of [[Manchester city centre]] and {{convert|8|mi|0}} north of the border of [[Greater Manchester]], and is situated on the mostly [[culvert]]ed [[River Hyndburn]]. The town has a population of 35,203 according to the [[United Kingdom Census 2001|2001 census]] and the urban area has a population of over 70,000.

The town is a former centre of the cotton and textile machinery industries. The town is famed for manufacturing the hardest and densest building bricks in the world, [[Accrington brick|&quot;The Accrington NORI&quot; (iron)]], which were used in the construction of the [[Empire State Building]] and for the foundations of [[Blackpool Tower]]; famous for its football team and for having Europe's largest collection of Tiffany Glass.

Accrington is commonly abbreviated by locals to &quot;'''Accy'''&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;(said Acky).[http://www.accringtonobserver.co.uk/sport/s/226/226734_nish_back_for_accy.html Nish back for Accy]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
There are two derivations for the name of Accrington. Both agree that &quot;''ton''&quot; means &quot;''a town or enclosure of''&quot;, from [[Old English|Anglo-Saxon]]; however one derivation states that ring means &quot;''the people of''&quot; and &quot;''accr''&quot; is a distortion of a family called alker. Nevertheless there is little evidence of this as it would have been the chief or land owner in the area. The alternative derivation states that &quot;''accring''&quot; is derived from &quot;''acorn ringed''&quot; which is plausible due to the numerous [[oak]] trees which formerly encircled the town but were lost during the industrial revolution. This is still reflected in the name of the district's largest park, Oak Hill Park.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}. Also another source claims the Accrington place name is believed to be derived from a combination of the old English word aecum, meaning ‚Äòacorn‚Äô and the suffix ‚Äòtun‚Äô meaning farmstead. The place name would appear to be Anglo-Saxon in origin.
The [[King's Highway]] which passes above the town was at one time used by the kings and queens of England when they used the area for hunting when it was one of the four forests of the [[Hundred (administrative division)|hundred]] of [[Blackburnshire]].

For many decades the textile industry was the central activity of the town. [[Cotton mill|Mills]] and [[dye]] works provided work for the inhabitants; but often in very difficult conditions. There was regular conflict with employers, most famously in the 1842 [[1842 General Strike|'plug riots']] where a [[general strike]] spread from town to town. The workers unplugged the boilers needed for the operation of the machinery as thousands of strikers walked over the hills from one town to another to persuade people to join the strike.  The strike joined up with the [[Chartism|Chartist]] movement but eventually proved unsuccessful in its aims.

A further wave of rioting hit the town in 1962 when local men and youths clashed with some of the [[Asia]]n and [[Caribbean]] [[Commonwealth]] immigrants who had settled in the town since the late [[1940s]].[http://www.searchlightmagazine.com/index.php?link=template&amp;story=35]

=== Accrington Pals ===
{{Further|[[Recruitment to the British Army during World War I]]}}

One well-known association the town has is with the '[[Accrington Pals]]', the nickname given to the smallest home town [[battalion]] of volunteers formed to fight in [[World War I|the first world war]]. The [[Pals battalion]]s were a peculiarity of the 1914-18 war: [[Horatio Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener of Khartoum|Lord Kitchener]], the [[Secretary of State for War]], believed that it would help recruitment if friends and work-mates from the same town were able to join up and fight together. Strictly speaking, the 'Accrington Pals' battalion is properly known as the '11th [[East Lancashire Regiment]]': the nickname is a little misleading, since of the four 250-strong companies that made up the original battalion only one was actually composed of men from Accrington. The rest volunteered from other east [[Lancashire]] towns such as [[Burnley]], [[Blackburn]] and [[Chorley]]. {{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

The Pals' first day of action, Saturday July 1, 1916, took place in [[Serre]] in the north of France. It was part of the 'Big Push' (later known as the [[Battle of the Somme (1916)|Battle of the Somme]]) that was intended to force the [[German Army]] into a retreat from the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], a line they had held since late 1914. The German defences in Serre were supposed to have been obliterated by sustained, heavy, British shelling during the preceding week; however, as the battalion advanced it met with fierce resistance. 235 men were killed and a further 350 wounded &amp;mdash; more than half of the battalion &amp;mdash; within half an hour. Similarly desperate losses were suffered elsewhere on the front, in a disastrous day for the British Army.

Later in the year, the East Lancashire Regiment was rebuilt with new volunteers &amp;mdash; in all, 865 Accrington men were killed during [[World War I]]. All of these names are recorded on a war memorial, an imposing white stone cenotaph, which stands in Oak Hill Park in the south of the town. The [[cenotaph]] also lists the names of 173 local fatalities from [[World War II]].

After [[World War I]] and until 1986, Accrington Corporation buses were painted in the regimental colours of red and blue with gold lining. The mudguards were painted black as a sign of mourning.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

==Demography==
The 2001 census gave the population of Accrington town as 35,203. The figure for the urban area was 71,224, up 1.1% from 70,442 in 1991. This total includes Accrington, [[Church, Lancashire|Church]], [[Clayton-le-Moors]], [[Great Harwood]] and [[Oswaldtwistle]]. For comparison purposes that is approximately the same size as [[Aylesbury]], [[City of Carlisle|Carlisle]], [[Guildford]] or [[Scunthorpe]] urban areas.

The borough of [[Hyndburn]] as a whole has a population of 81,496. This includes Accrington Urban Area and other outlying towns and villages such as; [[Altham, Lancashire|Altham]], [[Baxenden]], part of [[Belthorn]], [[Huncoat]], [[Rishton]] and Stanhill.

==Geography==
{{expand section|date=November 2009}}
Accrington is a hill town located at the western edge of the Pennines within a bowl that is largely encircled by surrounding hills. Hill settlements origins were as the economic foci of the district engaging in the spinning and weaving of woolen cloth. Wool lead and coal were other local industries.

==Transport==
The town has strong local travel links as [[Accrington railway station]] lies on the [[East Lancashire Line]] serving trains running locally and trains running from [[Blackpool]] to [[York]]. However, recent changes to the train timetables have been a disservice to Accrington, increasing the journey time to Preston (a vital link to London or Scotland) by up to 1.5 hours. However, there are still buses to Manchester every thirty minutes as well as more frequent services to other towns in east Lancashire.  The main road running through the town centre is the [[A680 road|A680]] running from [[Rochdale]] to [[Whalley, Lancashire|Whalley]]. The town is served by junction seven of the [[M65 motorway|M65]] and is linked from the A680 and the [[A56 road|A56]] [[dual carriageway]] which briefly merge; linking to the [[M66 motorway]] heading towards Manchester. The closest airports are [[Manchester Airport]] at {{convert|27|mi}}, [[Blackpool Airport]] at {{convert|28|mi}} and [[Leeds Bradford Airport]] at {{convert|30|mi}}.

There was once a rail link south to Manchester via [[Haslingden]] and [[Bury]], but this was closed in the 1960s as part of cuts following the [[Beeching Report]]. The trackbed from Accrington to [[Baxenden]] is now a linear treelined cycleway/footpath.

The small minibus operator M &amp; M Coaches and its main competitor [[Transdev]] [[Lancashire United]] provide service in Accrington,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.factolex.com/M_&amp;_M_Coaches|title=M &amp; M Coaches|publisher=Factolex|accessdate=17 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; with routes to places such as [[Blackburn]], [[Oswaldtwistle]], [[Rishton]], [[Burnley]] and [[Clitheroe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carlberry.co.uk/op/M_and_M_Coaches_Accrington.htm|title=Bus service information for bus operator M &amp; M Coaches, also known as Iqbal, of Accrington, Lancashire County.|publisher=carlberry.co.uk|accessdate=2009-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social==
===Governance===
Accrington is represented in parliament as a part of the constituency of Hyndburn. Note that the constituency boundaries do not align exactly with those of the district of the same name.

Accrington was first represented nationally after the [[Redistribution of Seats Act 1885]] after the [[United Kingdom general election, 1885|1885 general election]] by [[Accrington (UK Parliament constituency)]]. This seat was abolished in the 1983 general election and replaced with the present constituency of [[Hyndburn (UK Parliament constituency)]].

Hyndburn consists of 16 wards of 35 councillors. Due to its size Accrington is represented by a number of wards in the Borough of [[Hyndburn]]. The town largely consists of the Milnshaw, Peel, Central, Barnfield and Spring Hill wards, although some parts of those wards are in other towns in the borough.

Accrington became incorporated as a [[municipal borough]] in 1878. Under the [[Local Government Act 1972]], since 1974, the town has formed part of the larger Borough of [[Hyndburn]] including the former [[Urban District]]s of [[Oswaldtwistle]], [[Church, Lancashire|Church]], [[Clayton-le-Moors]], [[Great Harwood]] and [[Rishton]].

===Education===
The schools of Accrington include:
*[[Accrington St Christopher's C of E High]], a Church of England secondary school which holds specialist [[Technology College]] status.
*[[Accrington Academy]], a specialist [[Sports College]]
* The Hollins Technology College
*[[Accrington and Rossendale College]], now named Accross, is a further education college for 14-19 Year olds.
*[[Mount Carmel Roman Catholic High School]], a secondary school serving the Catholic community of Hyndburn and those who support its ethos.
The school holds specialist [[Science College]] status.
Rhyddings Business and Enterprise High School, in nearby [[Oswaldtwistle]], also serves the area.
[[Image:Blackburn-Rd-Regeneration.jpg|thumb|left|Accrington Acorn PHCC under construction]]

===Health===
The local [[hospital]] is Accrington Victoria Hospital however, as it only deals with minor issues, [[Accident and Emergency|A&amp;E]] is provided by the Royal Blackburn Hospital. Other services are provided at the Accrington Pals Primary Health Care Centre and the Accrington Acorn Primary Health Care Centre. Some wards in Accrington rank amongst the most deprived in terms of healthcare and life expectancy in the country. According to the 1991 census 28% of houses in the borough were considered 'unfit', chiefly those in Accrington and Church. A current urban regeneration scheme, Elevate East Lancashire, is attempting to remedy these problems.

===Media===

The chief publications in the area are the ''Accrington Observer'', part of [[Manchester Evening News|MEN media]], and the ''Lancashire Telegraph''.

== Sports ==
The town's other famous association is with [[Accrington Stanley F.C.]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accringtonstanley.co.uk/ Accrington Stanley F.C.]&lt;/ref&gt; the butt of many (largely affectionate) jokes.  The club's name is often invoked as a symbol of British sport's legion of plucky but hopeless causes (much like British ski-jumping's only ski jumper to compete at the olympic games [[Eddie &quot;The Eagle&quot; Edwards]]).

The club entered the [[The Football League|Football League]] in 1921 with the formation of the old [[Third Division (North)]]; after haunting the lower reaches of English football for forty years, they eventually resigned from the League in 1962, due to financial problems, and folded in 1965. The club was reformed three years later and then worked its way through the non-league divisions to reach the [[Football Conference|Nationwide Conference]] in 2003. In the 2005&amp;ndash;06 season, Stanley, after winning against [[Woking F.C.|Woking]] with 3 matches to spare, secured a place back in the [[The Football League|Football League]] and the town celebrated with a small parade and honours placed on senior executives of the team. Coincidentally, one of the teams relegated&amp;mdash;and thus being replaced by Stanley&amp;mdash;were [[Oxford United F.C.|Oxford United]], who were voted into the Football League to replace the previous Accrington Stanley. The football stadium is called the Crown Ground. Accrington is the smallest town in [[England and Wales]] with a [[Football League]] club.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lovemytown.co.uk/FootballTeams/FootballTeamsTable5.asp Towns Represented in League Two 2007-8]&lt;/ref&gt;

Accrington Stanley Football Club has officially had its own [[Public house|pub]] in the town, the Crown, since July 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accringtonstanley.co.uk/index.php/commercial/crown http://www.accringtonstanley.co.uk/index.php/commercial/crown] ''Accringtonstanley.co.uk''&lt;/ref&gt;

The club was ridiculed during the [[1980s]] with a [[milk]] [[Television advertisement|advert]] on television, in which a young boy boasted that [[Ian Rush]] had told him that &quot;if [he] didn't drink lots of milk, when [he] [grew] up, [he'd] only be good enough to play for Accrington Stanley&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieK7b4KLL4 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieK7b4KLL4] ''Youtube.com''&lt;/ref&gt;

An earlier club, [[Accrington F.C.]], were one of the twelve founder members of the [[Football League]] in 1888. However, their time in league football was even less successful and considerably briefer than that of Accrington Stanley: they dropped out of the league in 1893 and folded shortly afterwards due to financial problems. The town of Accrington thus has the unique &quot;distinction&quot; of having lost two separate clubs from league football.

== Tiffany Glass ==
The Haworth Art Gallery&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hyndburnbc.gov.uk/hag Haworth Art Gallery]&lt;/ref&gt; in Accrington contains an outstanding collection of [[Tiffany glass]]ware presented to the town by Joseph Briggs, an Accrington man who had joined [[Tiffany &amp; Co|Tiffany‚Äôs]] in the late 19th century and eventually became art director and assistant manager. The [[Art Nouveau]] vases are considered to be the most important such group in Europe. One of the most striking items is a glass mosaic exhibition piece, designed by Briggs himself and entitled &quot;''Sulphur Crested Cockatoos''&quot;.

==Regeneration==
Accrington and the townships that make up the Borough are being gradually transformed by the ambitious regeneration plans, which are being put in place. One of the most important pieces of the regeneration jigsaw for the Borough is reviving Accrington town centre.  The town centre is a principal engine of economic revival not only for all communities across the Borough, but also for Pennine Lancashire.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

The Council recognized expert help was required to help shape what the town centre should look like over the next 10‚Äì15 years and how to make this happen. The Council using funding from the Single Regeneration Budget appointed URBED (Urban, Built, Environment Design), consultants based in Manchester to help the Council, our partners and the local community develop a new vision for Accrington town centre.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

{{Christian Eschatology}}
Mount '''Armageddon''' {{lang-he|◊î÷∑◊® ◊û÷∞◊í÷¥◊ì÷º◊ï÷π}}, ''Har Megiddo'' ({{lang-grc| ·ºâœÅŒºŒ±Œ≥ŒµŒ¥œéŒΩ}} ''Harmaged≈çn'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://bibletranslation.ws/trans/revwgrk.pdf Bibletranslation.ws]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://scripturetext.com/revelation/16-16.htm Scripturetext.com]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arabic language|Arabic]] Ÿáÿ±ŸÖÿ¨ÿØŸàŸÜ, [[Persian language|Persian]] ÿ¢ÿ±ŸÖÿß⁄ØÿØŸÜ, [[Late Latin]]: {{lang|la|''Armaged≈çn''}}&lt;ref&gt;''Collins English Dictionary'', HarperCollins, 3rd ed., p. 81&lt;/ref&gt;)&amp;nbsp; is the site of a battle during the [[end time]]s according to some sects within the [[Abrahamic religions]]. The term can also be used in a more generic sense to refer to any end-of-the-world scenario.

According to some [[Premillennialism|premillennial]] Christian interpretations, the [[Messiah]] will [[Second Coming|return to earth]] and defeat the [[Antichrist]] ([[The Beast (Bible)|the &quot;beast&quot;]]) [[Satan]]/[[Lucifer]]/ [[Devil]] in the battle of ''Armageddon''. Then [[Satan]] will be put into the &quot;bottomless pit&quot; or [[Abyss (religion)|abyss]] for 1,000 years, known as the [[Millennial Age]]. After being released from the abyss, Satan will gather [[Gog and Magog]] (peoples of two specific nations) from the four [[corners of the earth]]. They will encamp surrounding the &quot;holy ones&quot; and the &quot;beloved city&quot; (this refers to [[Jerusalem in Christianity|Jerusalem]]). Fire will come down from [[God in Christianity|God]], out of [[heaven]] and devour Gog and Magog after the Millennium, and the [[Devil]] who deceived them is thrown into [[Gehenna]] (the [[Lake of Fire]] and brimstone, or [[Hell]]) where the Beast and the [[False Prophet]] have been since just before the 1,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;[[Book of Revelation]] in the [[New Testament]], Rev. 19: 11-20, Rev. 20: 1-3, 7-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''Armageddon'' appears only once in the [[Novum Testamentum Graece|Greek New Testament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Revelation|16:16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word may come from [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] ''har m…ôgidd√¥'' ({{lang|he|◊î◊® ◊û◊í◊ô◊ì◊ï}}), meaning &quot;Mountain of [[Tel Megiddo|Megiddo]]&quot;. &quot;Mount&quot; (actually a Tel) Megiddo is a small mount or hill on which ancient forts were built that guarded the main highway, the [[Via Maris]], that connected [[Ancient Egypt]] with [[Mesopotamia]]. Megiddo was the location of many decisive battles in ancient times (including [[Battle of Megiddo (15th century BC)|one in the 15th century BC]] and [[Battle of Megiddo (609 BC)|one in 609 BC]]). The [[Megiddo, Israel|town Megiddo in Israel]] is approximately {{convert|25|mi}} westsouthwest of the southern tip of the [[Sea of Galilee]] (or ''Lake Tiberias'' to the Romans) in the Kishon River area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bloganavazquez.com/tag/anales-tutmosis-iii/ Maps and pictures of Megiddo mountain and the surrounding plain (in Spanish)]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|Christian eschatology}}

Megiddo is mentioned twelve times in the [[Old Testament]], ten times in reference to the ancient city of [[Megiddo]], and twice with reference to &quot;the plain of Megiddo&quot;, most probably simply meaning &quot;the plain next to the city&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;Bible cite&quot;&gt;{{cite web

| title= Bible Keyword Search Results: megiddo (KJV)
| accessdate = 2011-01-15}} Listing of the 12 Biblical Old Testament passages containing the word &quot;Megiddo&quot;.
&lt;/ref&gt;
None of these Old Testament passages describe the city of Megiddo as being associated with any particular prophetic beliefs. The one [[New Testament]] reference to the city of Armageddon found in [[Book of Revelation|Revelation 16:16]] in fact also makes no specific mention of any armies being predicted to one day gather in this city, but instead seems to predict only that &quot;they (will gather) the kings together to .... Armageddon.&lt;ref name = &quot;No armies referred to&quot;&gt;{{cite web

| title= Revelation 16, The Seven Bowls of God's Wrath
| accessdate = 2011-01-15}} New Testament excerpt describing various apparent calamities of nature with respect to Armageddon.&lt;/ref&gt;&quot;
The text does however seem to imply, based on the text from the earlier passage of Revelation 16:14, that the purpose of this gathering of kings in the &quot;place called Armageddon&quot; might be so that these kings could do battle with one another. Because of the seemingly highly symbolic and even cryptic language of this one New Testament passage, some Christian scholars conclude the Mount Armageddon must be an idealized location.&lt;ref name=&quot;Biblical Horizons, No. 85&quot;&gt;[[James B. Jordan]], [http://www.biblicalhorizons.com/biblical-horizons/no-85-some-observations/ Biblical Horizons, No. 85]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rousas John Rushdoony|Rushdoony]] says, &quot;There are no mountains of Megiddo, only the Plains of Megiddo. This is a deliberate destruction of the vision of any literal reference to the place.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Rousas John Rushdoony]], ''Thy Kingdom Come: Studies in Daniel and Revelation'', 190.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Other scholars, including [[C. C. Torrey]], [[Meredith G. Kline|Kline]] and [[James B. Jordan|Jordan]] argue that the word is derived from the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] ''moed'' ({{lang|he|◊û◊ï◊¢◊ì}}), meaning &quot;assembly&quot;. Thus, &quot;Armageddon&quot; would mean &quot;Mountain of Assembly,&quot; which Jordan says is &quot;a reference to the assembly at [[Biblical Mount Sinai|Mount Sinai]], and to its replacement, Mount [[Zion]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Biblical Horizons, No. 85&quot;/&gt;

=== Dispensationalism ===
The [[Dispensationalism|Dispensational]] viewpoint interprets biblical prophecy literally and expects that the fulfillment of prophecy will also be literal, depending upon the context of scripture. In his discussion of Armageddon, [[J. Dwight Pentecost]] has devoted an entire chapter to the subject, titled &quot;The Campaign of Armageddon&quot;, in which he discusses Armageddon as a campaign and not a specific [[battle]], which will be fought in the [[Middle East]]. Pentecost writes:

{{Quote|It has been held commonly that the battle of Armageddon is an isolated event transpiring just prior to the [[Second Advent of Christ|second advent of Christ]] to the earth. The extent of this great movement in which God deals with &quot;the kings of the earth and of the whole world&quot; (Rev. 16:14) will not be seen unless it is realized that the &quot;battle of that great day of God Almighty&quot; (Rev. 16:14)&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Revelation|16:14|NKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; is not an isolated battle, but rather a campaign that extends over the last half of the tribulation period. The Greek word &quot;polemo&quot;, translated &quot;battle&quot; in Revelation 16:14, signifies a war or campaign, while &quot;machƒì&quot; signifies a battle, and sometimes even single combat. This distinction is observed by Trench, (see [[Richard Chenevix Trench|Richard C. Trench]], New Testament Synonyms, pp.301-2) and is followed by Thayer (see [[Joseph Henry Thayer]], Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament, p. 528) and Vincent (see Marvin R. Vincent, Word Studies in the New Testament, II, 541). The use of the word polemos (campaign) in Revelation 16:14 would signify that the events that culminate in the gathering at Armageddon at the second advent are viewed by God as one connected campaign.|Pentecost, p.340}}

Pentecost then discusses the location of this campaign, and mentions the &quot;hill of Megiddo&quot; and other geographic locations such as &quot;the [[Valley of Josaphat|valley of Jehoshaphat]]&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Joel|3:2|NKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;the valley of the passengers&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Ezekiel|39:11|NKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Lord coming from [[Edom]] or Idumea, south of [[Jerusalem]], when He returns from [[Last judgment|the judgment]]&quot;; and Jerusalem itself.&lt;ref&gt;Zech. 12:2-11; 14:2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pentacost, p. 341&lt;/ref&gt;

Pentecost further describes the area involved:

{{quote|This wide area would cover the entire land of [[Israel]] and this campaign, with all its parts, would confirm what [[Ezekiel]] pictures when he says the invaders will 'cover the land'.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Ezekiel|38:9-16|NKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; This area would conform to the extent pictured by [[John of Patmos|John]] in Revelation 14:20.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Revelation|14:20|NKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Pentecost then outlines the biblical time period for this campaign to occur and with further arguments concludes that it must take place with the [[Prophecy of Seventy Weeks|70th week of Daniel]]. The invasion of Israel by the Northern Confederacy &quot;will bring the Beast and his armies to the defense of Israel as her protector&quot;. He then uses [[Daniel]] to further clarify his thinking: (Dan. 11:40b-45).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Daniel 11:40-45 (King James Version)| publisher =BibleGateway.com| url =http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Dan.%2011:40-45;&amp;version=9;| accessdate =2007-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Again, events are listed by Pentecost in his book:

# &quot;The movement of the campaign begins when the King of the South moves against the Beast-False Prophet coalition, which takes place 'at the time of the end.'&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Daniel 11:40 (King James Version)| publisher =BibleGateway.com| url =http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Dan.%2011:40;&amp;version=9;| accessdate =2007-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# &quot;The King of the South is joined by the Northern Confederacy, who attacks the Wilful King by a great force over land and sea (11:40). Jerusalem is destroyed as a result of this attack,&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Zechariah|12:2|NKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, in turn, the armies of the Northern Confederacy are destroyed&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Ezekiel|39|NKJV}}, {{bibleverse||Zeckariah|12:4|NKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# &quot;The full armies of the Beast move into Israel (11:41) and shall conquer all that territory (11:41-42). Edom, [[Moab]], and [[Ammon]] alone escape. . . .&quot;
# &quot;. . . a report that causes alarm is brought to the Beast&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Revelation|11:44|NKJV}}, {{bibleverse||Revelation|16:12|NKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# &quot;The Beast moves his headquarters into the land of Israel and assembles his armies there.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Daniel|11:45|NKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# &quot;It is there that his destruction will come. (11:45).&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Pentacost, p. 356&lt;/ref&gt;

After the destruction of the Beast at the [[Second Coming]] of [[Jesus]], the [[Kingdom of God|promised Kingdom]] is set up, in which Jesus and the [[Saints]] will rule for a [[Millennialism|thousand years]]. Satan is then loosed &quot;for a season&quot; and goes out to deceive the nations, specifically, Gog and Magog.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Revelation|20:8|NKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; The army mentioned attacks the Saints in the [[New Jerusalem]], they are defeated by a judgment of fire coming down from Heaven, and then comes the [[Great White Throne]] judgment, which includes all of those through the ages&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Revelation|20:11-15|NKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; and these are cast into the [[Lake of Fire]], which event is also known as the &quot;second death&quot; and Gehenna, not to be confused with Hell, which is Satan's domain. Pentecost describes this as follows:

{{quote|The destiny of the lost is a place in the lake of fire (Rev. 19:20; 20:10, 14-15; 21:8). This lake of fire is described as everlasting fire (Matt. 25:41)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Matthew 25:41 (King James Version)| url =http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matt.%2025:41;&amp;version=9;| accessdate =2007-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Matt. 18:8)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Matthew 18:8 (King James Version)| url =http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matt.%2018:8;&amp;version=9;| accessdate =2007-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as unquenchable fire (Mark 9:43-44),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Mark 9:43-44 (King James Version)| url =http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%209:43-44;&amp;version=9;| accessdate =2007-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; 46-48,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Mark 9:46-48 (King James Version)| url =http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%209:46-48;&amp;version=9;| accessdate =2007-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; emphasizing the eternal character of retribution of the lost.|Pentacost, p. 555}}

=== Jehovah's Witnesses ===

[[Jehovah's Witnesses]] believe that Armageddon is a battle in which Satan unites the kings of the earth against God's appointed king, Jesus Christ. Unlike other [[Christian]] groups, Witnesses believe that the 'Antichrist' is not an individual, that the war is not one of nations fighting against each other,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.watchtower.org/e/20051201/article_02.htm Armageddon - A Happy Beginning]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.watchtower.org/e/20080401/article_02.htm Armageddon‚ÄîGod‚Äôs War to End All Wars]&lt;/ref&gt; and that Megiddo refers to a symbolic gathering of all the kings of the earth.

According to ''[[The Watchtower]]'' magazine, prior to Armageddon &quot;militarized powers within the [[United Nations]]&quot; will attack all religions, and then focus their attack on the Witnesses, who will continue to preach.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.watchtower.org/e/kn37/article_01.htm The End of False Religion is Near watchtower.org]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Watchtower 9/15/05 p. 19 par. 13 &quot;Walk by Faith, Not by Sight!&quot; Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania&lt;/ref&gt; The world's leaders will then battle against God and his forces, provoked by expressions and signs inspired by demons;&lt;ref&gt;''The Watchtower'' 12/1/05 p. 4 [http://www.watchtower.org/e/20051201/article_02.htm Armageddon‚ÄîA Happy Beginning] Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania&lt;/ref&gt; after they are destroyed God's Kingdom will be established over earth for a thousand years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.watchtower.org/e/dg/article_10.htm The Marvelous New World of God's Making watchtower.org]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Last Judgment|final judgment]] and purification of earth's sin occurs at the end of the [[premillennialism|millennium]].&lt;ref&gt;Watchtower 6/1/96 p. 18 par. 20 &quot;Flight to Safety Before the &quot;Great Tribulation&quot;&quot; Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Seventh-day Adventist ===
{{Main|Seventh-day Adventist eschatology#Armageddon}}
[[File:Armageddon flowchart.png|thumb|[[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventist]] understanding of Revelation 13-22]]
The teachings of the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] state that the terms &quot;Armageddon&quot;, &quot;Day of the Lord&quot; and &quot;The Second Coming of Christ&quot; all describe the same event.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Seventh-day Adventists believe&quot; 1988 by the Ministerial Association General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists&lt;/ref&gt; Seventh-day Adventists further teach that the current religious movements taking place in the world are setting the stage for Armageddon, and they are concerned by the growing unity between [[spiritualism]], American [[Protestantism]] and [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]]. A further significant difference in [[Seventh-day Adventist theology]] is the teaching that the events of Armageddon will leave the earth desolate for the duration of the [[premillennialism|millennium]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Handbook of Seventh-day Adventist Theology&quot; 2000 Review and Herald Publishing Association and the General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists&lt;/ref&gt; They teach that the righteous will be taken to heaven while the rest of humanity will be destroyed, leaving Satan with no one to tempt and effectively &quot;bind.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Revelation|20:1|NKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final re-creation of a &quot;new heaven and a new earth.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Revelation|21:1|NKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; then follows the millennium.

===Influence===
The idea that a final &quot;Battle of Armageddon&quot; will be fought at [[Tel Megiddo]] has had a wide influence, especially in the US. According to Donald E. Wagner, Professor of Religion and Director of the Center for Middle Eastern Studies at [[North Park University]], [[Ronald Reagan]] was an adherent of &quot;Armageddon theology,&quot; and &quot;seemed to blend his political analysis with his Armageddon theology quite naturally.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Donald E. Wagner, [http://www.cnep.org/churchorgs/methodist/CZionism-Wagner1.doc The alliance between fundamentalist Christians and the Pro-Israel lobby: Christian Zionism in US Middle East policy]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[militia movement|militia groups]] in the US, such as the [[Hutaree]],&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/8593975.stm US 'Christian militants' charged after FBI raids]&quot; ''[[BBC]]'', 30 March 2010. Retrieved 30 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; are reported to have prepared for violent action associated with related apocalyptic beliefs.

== Islam ==
Muslims believe that the [[Prophets of Islam|Islamic Prophet]] [[Muhammad]](SM) prophesied several events to occur just before the advent of the Day of Judgment ([[Islamic view of the Last Judgment|Yawm al-QiyƒÅmah]]). Al Dajaal (the Antichrist) will fool people into believing that he is God and ask people to worship him. True believers (Muslims) will reject him but will not be able to defeat him on their own. God (Allah) will then send Isa (Jesus) to earth to fight the Antichrist in the battle of Armageddon, and he will defeat Al Dajaal (the Antichrist) and his followers. This war is given the name &quot;Al-Malhama Al-Kubra&quot; (the biggest battle) in the [[Hadith]] (appearing in the [[Sahih al-Bukhari]] and [[Sahih Muslim]] collections).

=== Ahmadiyya ===
In [[Ahmadiyya]], Armageddon is viewed as a spiritual battle or struggle in the present age between the forces of good, i.e. righteousness, purity and virtue, and the forces of evil. The final struggle between the two comes as satanic influence is let loose with the emergence of [[Gog and Magog#In Ahmadiyya|Gog and Magog]]. Satan gathers all his powers, and uses all his methods to mislead people, introducing an age where iniquity, promiscuity, atheism, and materialism abound. According to Ahmadi teachings, the present age has as a result been a witness to the wrath of God with the occurrence of the [[World War I|First]] and [[World War II|Second World Wars]] and the frequency of natural disasters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aaiil.org/text/books/others/mirzamasumbeg/propheciespromisedmessiah/propheciespromisedmessiah.pdf AAIIL.org]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Ahmadis believe that God appointed [[Mirza Ghulam Ahmad]] as the [[Promised Messiah]] and [[Mahdi]] for the spiritual reformation and moral direction of mankind. The moral teachings of Islam, as elucidated by Ghulam Ahmad in accordance with the present age, would eventually protect from and overcome these evil things, and establish the unity and sincere worship of God and an age of peace on earth. This age continues for approximately one thousand years as per Judeo-Christian and Islamic prophecies of the [[Apocalypse]]; it is characterised by the assembling of mankind under one faith, Islam in Ahmadiyya belief.&lt;ref&gt;''The Review of Religions'', January 2009, Vol.104, issue 1. p. 18-22&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bah√°'√≠ faith ==
From [[Bah√°'√≠ Faith|Bah√°'√≠]] literature a number of interpretations of the expectations surrounding the Battle of Armageddon may be inferred, three of them being associated with events surrounding the World Wars:&lt;ref name=&quot;Lambden&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last=Lambden | first=Stephen | title=Catastrophe, Armageddon and Millennium: some aspects of the B√°b√≠-Bah√°'√≠ exegesis of apocalyptic symbolism | journal=Bah√°'√≠ Studies Review Volume 9 | url=http://bahai-library.com/lambden_catastrophe_millennium | accessdate=2007-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first interpretation deals with a series of tablets written by [[Bah√°'u'll√°h]], founder of the Bah√°'√≠ Faith, to be sent to various kings and rulers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lambden&quot;/&gt; 

The second, and best-known one, relates to events near the end of [[World War I]] involving [[Edmund Allenby, 1st Viscount Allenby|General Allenby]] and the [[Battle of Megiddo (1918)]] wherein World Powers are said to have drawn soldiers from many parts of the world to engage in battle at Megiddo. In winning this battle Allenby also prevented the [[Turkish people|Turks]] from killing [['Abdu'l-Baha]], then head of the [[Baha'i Faith]], whom they had intended to [[crucify]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Maude | year=1997 | title=The Servant, the General, and Armageddon | publisher=George Ronald | isbn=0853984247 | author=Roderic Maude and Derwent Maude.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A third interpretation reviews the overall progress of the World Wars, and the situation in the world before and after.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lambden&quot;/&gt;

'''Athlon''' is the brand name applied to a series of [[x86|x86-compatible]] [[microprocessor]]s designed and manufactured by [[Advanced Micro Devices]] (AMD). The original Athlon (now called ''Athlon Classic'') was the first seventh-generation x86 processor and, in a first, retained the initial performance lead it had over [[Intel Corporation|Intel]]'s competing processors for a significant period of time. The original Athlon also had the distinction of being the first desktop processor to reach speeds of one gigahertz (GHz). AMD has continued using the ''Athlon'' name with the [[Athlon 64]], an eighth-generation processor featuring [[x86-64]] (later renamed AMD64) architecture, and the [[Athlon II]].

The Athlon made its debut on June 23, 1999.  Athlon is the ancient Greek word for &quot;Champion/trophy of the games&quot;.

==Background==
AMD ex-CEO and founder [[Jerry Sanders (businessman)|Jerry Sanders]] developed strategic partnerships during the late 1990s to improve AMD's presence in the PC market based on the success of the [[AMD K6]] architecture. One major partnership announced in 1998 paired AMD with semiconductor giant [[Motorola]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hpcwire.com/hpc-bin/artread.pl?direction=Current&amp;articlenumber=13625  |title=Motorola Prepares to Manufacture AMD's Upcoming K7 Chip |publisher=HP |date=1998-08-07 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070928004540/http://www.hpcwire.com/hpc-bin/artread.pl?direction=Current&amp;articlenumber=13625 |archivedate = 2007-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the announcement, Sanders referred to the partnership as creating a &quot;virtual gorilla&quot; that would enable AMD to compete with Intel on fabrication capacity while limiting AMD's financial outlay for new facilities. This partnership also helped to co-develop [[Copper-based chips|copper-based semiconductor technology]], which would become a cornerstone of the K7 [[Semiconductor device fabrication|production process]].

In August 1999, AMD released the Athlon (K7) processor. Notably, the design team was led by [[Dirk Meyer]], who had worked as a lead engineer on multiple [[DEC Alpha|Alpha]] microprocessors during his employment at [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]]. Jerry Sanders had approached many of the engineering staff to work for AMD as DEC wound down their semiconductor business, and brought in a near-complete team of engineering experts. The balance of the Athlon design team comprised [[AMD K5]] and [[AMD K6|K6]] veterans.

By working with Motorola, AMD was able to refine copper interconnect manufacturing to the production stage about one year before Intel. The revised process permitted [[180 nm|180-nanometer]] processor production. The accompanying die-shrink resulted in lower power consumption, permitting AMD to increase Athlon clock speeds to the 1GHz range.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amd.com/us-en/Corporate/VirtualPressRoom/0,,51_104_543_552~729,00.html AMD Announces First Revenue Shipments From Dresden &quot;MEGAFAB&quot;], AMD Press Release, June 5, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Yields on the new process exceeded expectations, permitting AMD to deliver high speed chips in volume in March 2000.

==General architecture==
[[Image:Athlon arch.png|right|thumb|350px|Athlon architecture]]
Internally, the Athlon is a fully seventh generation x86 processor, the first of its kind. Like the AMD K5 and K6, the Athlon dynamically buffers internal micro-instructions at runtime resulting from parallel x86 instruction decoding. The CPU is an [[Out-of-order execution|out-of-order]] design, again like previous post-5x86 AMD CPUs. The Athlon utilizes the [[Alpha 21264]]'s EV6 bus architecture with [[double data rate]] (DDR) technology. This means that at 100&amp;nbsp;MHz the Athlon front side bus actually transfers at a rate similar to a 200&amp;nbsp;MHz single data rate bus (referred to as 200&amp;nbsp;[[Transfer (computing)|MT/s]]), which was superior to the method used on Intel's [[Pentium III]] (with SDR bus speeds of 100&amp;nbsp;MHz and 133&amp;nbsp;MHz).

AMD designed the CPU with more robust x86 instruction decoding capabilities than that of K6, to enhance its ability to keep more data in-flight at once. The Athlon's three decoders could potentially decode three x86 instructions to six microinstructions per clock, although this was somewhat unlikely in real-world use.&lt;ref name=PaulHsieh&gt;Hsieh, Paul. [http://www.azillionmonkeys.com/qed/cpujihad.shtml 7th Generation CPU Comparisons].&lt;/ref&gt; The critical branch predictor unit, essential to keeping the pipeline busy, was enhanced compared to what was on board the K6. Deeper pipelining with more stages allowed higher clock speeds to be attained.&lt;ref&gt;De Gelas, Johan. [http://web.archive.org/web/20011124231810/http://www.aceshardware.com/Spades/read.php?article_id=50 The Secrets of High Performance CPUs, Part 1], Ace's Hardware, September 29, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas the [[AMD K6-III]]+ topped out at 570&amp;nbsp;MHz due to its short pipeline, even when built on the 180&amp;nbsp;nm process, the Athlon was capable of clocking much higher.

AMD ended its long-time handicap with [[floating point]] [[x87]] performance by designing a super-[[Pipeline (computing)|pipelined]], out-of-order, triple-issue [[floating point unit]].&lt;ref name=PaulHsieh /&gt; Each of its three units was tailored to be able to calculate an optimal type of instructions with some redundancy. By having separate units, it was possible to operate on more than one floating point instruction at once.&lt;ref name=PaulHsieh /&gt; This FPU was a huge step forward for AMD. While the K6 FPU had looked anemic compared to the Intel [[P6 (microarchitecture)|P6]] FPU, with Athlon this was no longer the case.&lt;ref&gt;Pabst, Thomas. [http://www.tomshardware.com/1999/08/23/performance/page7.html Performance-Showdown between Athlon and Pentium III], Tom's Hardware, August 23, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[3DNow!]] [[floating point]] [[SIMD]] technology, again present, received some revisions and a name change to &quot;Enhanced 3DNow!&quot;. Additions included [[digital signal processing|DSP]] instructions and an implementation of the extended [[MMX (instruction set)|MMX]] subset of [[Streaming SIMD Extensions|Intel SSE]].&lt;ref&gt;Womack, Tom. [http://www.tom.womack.net/x86FAQ/faq_features.html Extensions to the x86 architecture].&lt;/ref&gt;

The Athlon's [[CPU cache]] consisted of the typical two levels. Athlon was the first x86 processor with a 128&amp;nbsp;[[kilobyte|KB]]&lt;ref&gt;{{BDprefix|p=b}}&lt;/ref&gt; split level 1 cache; a [[CPU cache|2-way associative]], later 16-way, cache separated into 2√ó64&amp;nbsp;KB for data and instructions ([[Harvard architecture]]).&lt;ref name=PaulHsieh /&gt; This cache was double the size of K6's already large 2√ó32&amp;nbsp;KB cache, and quadruple the size of [[Pentium II]] and III's 2√ó16&amp;nbsp;KB L1 cache. The initial Athlon (Slot A, later called Athlon Classic) used 512&amp;nbsp;KB of level 2 cache separate from the CPU, on the processor cartridge board, running at 50% to 33% of core speed. This was done because the 250&amp;nbsp;nm manufacturing process was too large to allow for on-die cache while maintaining cost-effective die size. Later Athlon CPUs, afforded greater transistor budgets by smaller [[180 nanometer|180&amp;nbsp;nm]] and [[130 nanometer|130&amp;nbsp;nm]] process nodes, moved to on-die L2 cache at full CPU clock speed.

==Athlon==
===Athlon &quot;Classic&quot;===
[[Image:Argonathlon.jpg|right|thumb|Athlon Slot A cartridge. Note heat sink and cooling fan assembly on rear side.]]
[[Image:Amd athlon classic.jpg|right|thumb|Logo on Slot A Athlon cartridge.]]
[[Image:Slot-A Athlon.jpg|right|thumb|An open Slot A cartridge. MPU die is in the center.]]
The Athlon, later called Athlon Classic, launched on June 23, 1999 and was generally available in August of that year. It demonstrated superior performance compared to the reigning champion, Intel's Pentium III, in every benchmark.&lt;ref&gt;Lal Shimpi, Anand. [http://www.anandtech.com/showdoc.aspx?i=1015 AMD Athlon], August 9, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Athlon Classic is a cartridge-based processor. The design, called [[Slot A]], was similar to Intel's [[Slot 1]] cartridge used for Pentium II and Pentium III. The mating [[motherboard]] receptacle was the same part used with Intel products but keyed differently to prevent installation of the wrong CPU. The cartridge assembly allowed the use of higher speed cache memory than can be put on the motherboard. Like Pentium II and the Katmai-based Pentium III, the Athlon Classic contained 512&amp;nbsp;KB of L2 cache. This cache, again like its competitors, ran at a fraction of the core clock rate and had its own 64-bit bus, called a &quot;[[back-side bus]]&quot;, that allowed concurrent system front side bus and cache accesses.&lt;ref&gt;De Gelas, Johan. [http://web.archive.org/web/20011225163156/http://aceshardware.com/read.jsp?id=71 Clash of Silicon, The Athlon 650], Ace's Hardware, September 29, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Initially the L2 cache was run at half the CPU clock speed, on Athlon CPUs clocked up to 700&amp;nbsp;MHz. Faster Slot-A processors were forced to compromise with cache clock speed and ran at 2/5 (up to 850&amp;nbsp;MHz) or 1/3 (up to 1&amp;nbsp;GHz).&lt;ref&gt;Lal Shimpi, Anand. [http://www.anandtech.com/showdoc.aspx?i=1189&amp;p=2 AMD Athlon 1&amp;nbsp;GHz, 950&amp;nbsp;MHz, 900&amp;nbsp;MHz], Anandtech, March 6, 2000, p.2.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Static Random Access Memory|SRAM]] available at the time was incapable of matching the Athlon's clock scalability, due both to cache chip technology limitations and electrical/cache latency complications of running an external cache at such a high speed.

The Slot-A Athlons were the first multiplier-locked CPUs from AMD. This was partly done to hinder CPU remarking being done by questionable resellers around the globe. AMD's older CPUs could simply be set to run at whatever clock speed the user chose on the motherboard, making it trivial to relabel a CPU and sell it as a faster grade than it was originally intended. These relabeled CPUs were not always stable, being overclocked and not tested properly, and this was damaging to AMD's reputation. Although the Athlon was multiplier locked, crafty enthusiasts eventually discovered that a connector on the PCB of the cartridge could control the multiplier. Eventually a product called the &quot;Goldfingers device&quot; was created that could unlock the CPU, named after the gold connector pads on the processor board that it attached to.&lt;ref&gt;Noonan, Jim and Rolfe, James. [http://www.overclockers.com.au/techstuff/r_gfd1/ Athlon Gold-Finger Devices], Overclockers.com.au, accessed August 24, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In commercial terms, the Athlon &quot;Classic&quot; was an enormous success‚Äînot just because of its own merits, but also because Intel endured a series of major production, design, and quality control issues at this time. In particular, Intel's transition to the 180&amp;nbsp;nm production process, starting in late 1999 and running through to mid-2000, suffered delays. There was a shortage of Pentium III parts. In contrast, AMD enjoyed a remarkably smooth process transition and had ample supplies available, causing Athlon sales to become quite strong.

The Argon-based Athlon contained 22 million transistors and measured 184&amp;nbsp;mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. It was fabricated by AMD in a slightly modified version of their CS44E process, a 0.25&amp;nbsp;¬µm [[complementary metal‚Äìoxide‚Äìsemiconductor]] (CMOS) process with six levels of aluminium interconnect.&lt;ref name=&quot;JSSC-1999-11-11&quot;&gt;Golden, Michael et al.

This version of the Athlon shipped in a more traditional [[Pin grid array|pin-grid array]] (PGA) format that plugged into a socket (&quot;[[Socket A]]&quot;) on the motherboard (it also shipped in the slot A package). It was sold at speeds ranging from 600&amp;nbsp;MHz to 1.4&amp;nbsp;GHz (Athlon Classics using the Slot A package could clock up to 1&amp;nbsp;GHz). The major difference, however, was cache design. Just as Intel had done when they replaced the old Katmai-based [[Pentium III]] with the much faster Coppermine-based Pentium III, AMD replaced the 512&amp;nbsp;KB external reduced-speed cache of the Athlon Classic with 256&amp;nbsp;KB of on-chip, full-speed exclusive cache. As a general rule, more cache improves performance, but faster cache improves it further still.&lt;ref name=SandpileK7&gt;[http://www.sandpile.org/impl/k7.htm K7 microarchitecture information], Sandpile.org, accessed September 26, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

AMD changed cache design significantly with the Thunderbird core. With the older Athlon CPUs, the CPU caching was of an inclusive design where data from the L1 is duplicated in the L2 cache. Thunderbird moved to an [[CPU cache#Multi-level caches|exclusive design]] where the L1 cache's contents are not duplicated in the L2. This increases total cache size of the processor and effectively makes caching behave as if there is a very large L1 cache with a slower region (the L2) and a very fast region (the L1).&lt;ref&gt;Stokes, John. [http://arstechnica.com/articles/paedia/cpu/amd-hammer-1.ars/9 Inside AMD's Hammer: the 64-bit architecture behind the Opteron and Athlon 64], Ars Technica, February 1, 2005:p.9.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of Athlon's very large L1 cache and the exclusive design which turns the L2 cache into basically a &quot;[[CPU cache#Victim cache|victim cache]]&quot;, the need for high L2 performance and size was lessened. AMD kept the 64-bit L2 cache data bus from the older Athlons, as a result, and allowed it to have a relatively high latency. A simpler L2 cache reduced the possibility of the L2 cache causing clock scaling and yield issues. Still, instead of the [[CPU cache#Associativity|2-way associative]] scheme used in older Athlons, Thunderbird did move to a more efficient 16-way associative layout.&lt;ref name=SandpileK7 /&gt;

The Thunderbird was AMD's most successful product since the [[Am386|Am386DX-40]] ten years earlier. Mainboard designs had improved considerably by this time, and the initial trickle of Athlon mainboard makers had swollen to include every major manufacturer. AMD's new [[Fab (semiconductors)|fab]] in [[Dresden]] came online, allowing further production increases, and the process technology was improved by a switch to copper interconnects. In October 2000 the Athlon &quot;C&quot; was introduced, raising the mainboard [[front side bus]] speed from 100&amp;nbsp;MHz to 133&amp;nbsp;MHz (266 [[MT/s]]) and providing roughly 10% extra performance per clock over the &quot;B&quot; model Thunderbird.

===Palomino===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Duron]] --&gt;
[[Image:KL AMD Athlon XP Palomino.jpg|right|150px|Athlon XP &quot;Palomino&quot; 2000+]]
AMD released the third-generation Athlon on October 9, 2001, code-named &quot;Palomino&quot;, and named it ''Athlon XP''. The ''Athlon XP'' was marketed using a [[Performance Rating|PR]] system, which compared its performance to an Athlon with the &quot;Thunderbird&quot; core. ''Athlon XP'' was introduced at speeds between 1.33&amp;nbsp;GHz and 1.53&amp;nbsp;GHz, with ratings from 1500+ to 1800+. At launch, the new core allowed AMD to take the x86 performance lead with the 1800+ model, and enhance that lead with the release of the 1600&amp;nbsp;MHz 1900+ less than a month later.&lt;ref&gt;Wasson, Scott. [http://www.techreport.com/reviews/2001q4/athlonxp-1900/index.x?pg=1 AMD's Athlon XP 1900+ processor: Pouring it on], The Tech Report, November 5, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1.67&amp;nbsp;GHz Athlon XP 2000+ was released in January, 2002. The &quot;XP&quot; suffix is interpreted to mean ''e'''X'''treme '''P'''erformance'' and also as an unofficial reference to Microsoft [[Windows XP]].&lt;ref&gt;Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. [http://www.amd.com/us-en/assets/content_type/DownloadableAssets/25626A__Sales-Reference-AhtlonXP.pdf Introducing the AMD Athlon XP Processor].&lt;/ref&gt;

Palomino was the first K7 core to include the full [[Streaming SIMD Extensions|SSE]] instruction set from the Intel [[Pentium III]] as well as AMD's [[3DNow!|3DNow! Professional]]. It is roughly 10% faster than Thunderbird at the same clock speed, thanks in part to the new SIMD functionality and to several additional improvements. The core has enhancements to the K7's [[Translation Lookaside Buffer|TLB]] architecture and the addition of a hardware data [[prefetching|prefetch]] mechanism to take better advantage of available memory bandwidth.&lt;ref name=Athlon4Anand&gt;Lal Shimpi, Anand. [http://www.anandtech.com/showdoc.aspx?i=1469&amp;p=4 AMD Athlon 4 - The Palomino is Here], Anandtech, May 14, 2001, p:4‚Äì5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Changes in core layout resulted in Palomino being more frugal with its electrical demands, consuming approximately 20% less power than its predecessor, and thus reducing heat output comparatively as well.&lt;ref&gt;Wasson, Scott. [http://www.techreport.com/reviews/2001q4/athlonxp/index.x?pg=1 AMD's Athlon XP 1800+ processor: 1533 &gt; 1800], The Tech Report, October 9, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; While Athlon &quot;Thunderbird&quot; was capable of clock speeds exceeding 1400&amp;nbsp;MHz, the power and thermal considerations required at those speeds would have made it increasingly impractical as a marketable product. Palomino's goals of lowered power consumption and resultant heat produced allowed it to continue AMD's goal of increasing clock speeds even while still utilizing the same 180&amp;nbsp;nm manufacturing process node and core voltage used by Thunderbird.

The &quot;Palomino&quot; was actually first released as a mobile version, called the '''Mobile Athlon 4''' (codenamed &quot;Corvette&quot;).&lt;ref name=Athlon4Anand /&gt; Palomino was also available in a form that officially supports dual processing, known as '''Athlon MP'''.&lt;ref&gt;Lal Shimpi, Anand.

===Thoroughbred (T-Bred)===
[[Image:KL AMD Athlon XP Thoroughbred.jpg|right|150px|Athlon XP &quot;Thoroughbred B&quot; 2400+]]
The fourth-generation Athlon, the ''Thoroughbred'', was released on 10 June 2002 at 1.8&amp;nbsp;GHz, or 2200+ on the [[Performance Rating|PR]] system. The &quot;Thoroughbred&quot; core marked AMD's first production 130&amp;nbsp;nm silicon, resulting in a significant reduction in die size compared to its 180&amp;nbsp;nm predecessor.

There are two versions of this core, commonly called A and B. The A version was introduced at 1800&amp;nbsp;MHz, and had some heat and design issues that held its clock scalability back. In fact, AMD wasn't able to increase its clock much above Palomino's top grades. Because of this, it was only sold in versions from 1333&amp;nbsp;MHz to 1800&amp;nbsp;MHz, replacing the larger Palomino core. The B version of Thoroughbred has an additional metal layer to improve its ability to reach higher clock speeds. It launched at higher clock speeds.

Other than the new manufacturing process, the Thoroughbred design was largely the same as the &quot;Palomino&quot;. The Thoroughbred line received an increased front side bus clock during its lifetime, from 133&amp;nbsp;MHz to 166&amp;nbsp;MHz (333&amp;nbsp;MT/s). This improved the processor's memory and I/O access efficiency, and improved per-clock performance as a result. AMD shifted their PR rating scheme accordingly, making lower clock speeds equate to higher PR ratings.

===Barton and Thorton===
[[Image:KL AMD Athlon XP Barton.jpg|thumb|225px|Athlon XP &quot;Barton&quot; 2500+]]
Fifth-generation Athlon ''Barton''-core processors released in early 2003 featured [[Performance Rating|PR]] ratings of 2500+, 2600+, 2800+, 3000+, and 3200+. While not operating at higher clock rates than  ''Thoroughbred''-core processors, they earned their higher PR-rating by featuring a total of 512&amp;nbsp;KB L2 cache and, in some models, a faster 200&amp;nbsp;MHz (400&amp;nbsp;MT/s) front side bus.&lt;ref name=AceBarton&gt;De Gelas, Johan. [http://web.archive.org/web/20030324002539/http://www.aceshardware.com/read.jsp?id=50000364 Barton: 512&amp;nbsp;KB Athlon XP Reviewed], Ace's Hardware, February 10, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Thorton'' core was a variant of the ''Barton'' with half of the L2 cache disabled and thus functionally identical to the ''Thoroughbred'' core; the word ''Thorton'' is in fact a [[portmanteau]] of ''Thoroughbred'' and ''Barton''.

By the time of Barton's release, the ''Northwood''-based [[Pentium 4]] had become more than competitive with AMD's processors.&lt;ref name=BartonAnand&gt;Lal Shimpi, Anand. [http://www.anandtech.com/cpuchipsets/showdoc.aspx?i=1783 AMD's Athlon XP 3000+: Barton cuts it close], AnandTech, February 10, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, due to the architecture of AMD's processor caches, an L2 cache increase to 512&amp;nbsp;KB did not have nearly the same impact as it did to Intel's line. Only an increase of several percent was gained in per-clock performance.&lt;ref name=AceBarton /&gt; The PR rating became somewhat inaccurate because some Barton models with lower clock rate weren't consistently outperforming their higher-clocked Thoroughbred predecessors with lower ratings.&lt;ref name=BartonAnand /&gt;

The other improvement, the higher 400&amp;nbsp;MT/s bus clock, helped Barton gain some more efficiency. However, it was clear by this time that Intel's quad-pumped bus was scaling well above AMD's double-pumped EV6 bus. The 800&amp;nbsp;MT/s bus used by many later Pentium 4 processors was well out of the Athlon XP's reach. In order to reach the same bandwidth levels, the Athlon&amp;nbsp;XP's bus would have to be clocked at levels simply unreachable.&lt;ref name=AceBarton /&gt;

The K7 architecture had scaled to its limit. Maintaining performance equivalence with Intel's improving processors would require a significant redesign.&lt;ref name=AceBarton /&gt; AMD would soon launch [[Athlon 64]].

===Mobile Athlon XP===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Transmeta]] --&gt;
[[Image:Athlon XPM 2400l.jpg|thumb|225px|Athlon XP Mobile &quot;Barton&quot; 2400+]]
Mobile Athlon XPs (''Athlon XP-M'') are identical to normal Athlon XPs, apart from running at lower voltages, often lower bus speeds, and not being [[CPU multiplier|multiplier]]-locked. The lower V&lt;sub&gt;core&lt;/sub&gt; rating caused the CPU to have lower power consumption (ideal for battery-powered laptops) and lower heat production. Athlon XP-M CPUs also have a higher-rated heat tolerance, a requirement of the tight conditions within a notebook PC.

The Athlon XP-M replaced the older Mobile Athlon 4. The Mobile Athlon 4 used the older ''Palomino'' core, while the Athlon XP-M used the newer ''Thoroughbred'' and ''Barton'' cores. Some specialized low-power Athlon XP-Ms utilize the microPGA [[socket 563]] rather than the standard Socket A.

The CPUs, like their mobile [[AMD K6-III|K6+]] predecessors, were also capable of dynamic clock adjustment for power optimization. When the system is [[idle]], the CPU clocks itself down through a lower bus multiplier and also reduces its voltage. Then, when a program demands more computational resources, the CPU very quickly (there is some latency) returns to intermediate or maximum speed to meet the demand. This technology was marketed as &quot;[[PowerNow!]]&quot;. It was similar to Intel's [[SpeedStep]] power saving technique. The feature was controlled by the CPU, motherboard [[BIOS]], and [[operating system]]. AMD later renamed the technology to [[Cool'n'Quiet]], on their K8-based CPUs ([[Athlon 64]], etc.), and introduced it for use on desktop PCs as well.

Athlon XP-Ms were popular with desktop [[overclocking|overclockers]], as well as [[underclocking|underclockers]]. The lower voltage requirement and higher heat rating resulted in CPUs that were basically &quot;[[Cherry picking (fallacy)|cherry picked]]&quot; from the manufacturing line. Being the best of the cores off the line, the CPUs typically were more reliably overclocked than their desktop-headed counterparts. Also, the fact that they weren't locked to a single multiplier was a significant simplification for the overclocking process. Some ''Barton'' core Athlon XP-Ms have been successfully overclocked to as high as 3.1&amp;nbsp;GHz.

As stated, the chips were also liked for their underclocking ability. Underclocking is a process of determining the lowest V&lt;sub&gt;core&lt;/sub&gt; at which a CPU can remain stable at for a given clock speed. The Athlon XP-M CPUs were capable of running lower voltages per clock rate compared to their desktop siblings. As such, the chips were used in [[home theater PC]] systems due to their high performance and low heat output at low V&lt;sub&gt;core&lt;/sub&gt; settings.

Besides not being locked to multiplier, they were also not disabled from SMP operation as were other Athlon XPs. Thus one could use them instead of the more expensive Athlon MP in dual socket A motherboards. Since those boards lacked multiplier and voltage adjustments, and could run only 133&amp;nbsp;MHz FSB the adjustment could have been made by wire-modding the CPU socket by connecting adjacent CPU pins. It was normal to overclock mobile 2500+ CPU to 2.26&amp;nbsp;GHz with 17x multiplier thus being faster than fastest official 2800+ MP CPU running at 2.13&amp;nbsp;GHz.

[[File:Traversi Ermordung Amnons.jpg|thumb|Ermordung Amnon]]
According to the [[Bible]], '''Amnon''' ({{lang-he-n|◊ê÷∑◊û÷∞◊†◊ï÷π◊ü}}, &quot;faithful&quot;) was the oldest son of [[David (biblical king)|David]], [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|King of Israel]], with his wife, [[Ahinoam]], who is described as &quot;the [[Jezreelite]]ss&quot;. ({{bibleverse|1|Chronicles|3:1|HE}}, {{bibleverse|2|Samuel|3:2|HE}}) 

==Rape of Tamar==

Although he was the heir-apparent to David's throne, Amnon is best remembered for the [[rape]] of his half-sister [[Tamar (2 Samuel)|Tamar]], daughter of David with [[Talmai#Talmai, father of Maacah|Maachah]].  

Despite the biblical prohibition to sexual relations between half-brothers and sisters, ({{bibleverse||Leviticus|18:11|NIV}}) Amnon had an overwhelming desire for her. He took advice from his cousin, [[Jonadab]] the son of Shimeah, David's brother, to lure Tamar into his quarters by pretending to be sick and desiring her to cook a special meal for him. While in his quarters, and ignoring her protests, he raped her. 

Two years later, to avenge his sister, [[Absalom]], Amnon's half-brother and Tamar's full brother, sent his servants to kill Amnon at a feast to which he had invited all the king's sons. ({{bibleverse|2|Samuel|13|NIV}})

The '''Amu Darya''' ({{lang-fa|ÿ¢ŸÖŸàÿØÿ±€åÿß}}, ''ƒÄm≈´daryƒÅ''; {{lang-ps|ÿØ ÿ¢ŸÖŸà ÿ≥ŸäŸÜÿØ}}, ''d…ô ƒÄmu Sind''; {{lang-ar|ÿ¨Ÿäÿ≠ŸàŸÜ}}, ''Jih√¥n'' or ''Jayhoun''; {{lang-he|◊í÷º◊ï÷π◊ñ÷∏◊ü}}, ''Gozan'' ), also called '''Oxus''' and '''Amu River''', is a major river in [[Central Asia]]. It is formed by the junction of the [[Vakhsh River|Vakhsh]] and [[Panj River|Panj]] rivers. In ancient times, the river was regarded as the boundary between [[Afghanistan]] and [[Turan|T≈´rƒÅn]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Iranica&quot;&gt;B. Spuler, [http://www.iranica.com/newsite/index.isc?Article=http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/unicode/v1f9/v1f9a135.html ƒÄM≈™ DARYƒÄ], in [[Encyclop√¶dia Iranica]], online ed., 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Bridge.Amu.Darya.Urgench.jpg|left|thumb|Pontoon Bridge on the Amu River near [[Urgench]]]]
In antiquity, the river was known as ''Vaksu'' to [[Indo-Aryans|Indo-Aryan]]s.

In ancient Afghanistan, the river was also called [[Gozan]], descriptions of which can be found in the book &quot;The Kingdom of Afghanistan: a historical sketch By George Passman Tate&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gozan - The River Oxus or Amu&quot;&gt;http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tGTd9KKwKVwC&amp;pg=PA11&amp;lpg=PA11&amp;dq=allintext:+%3D+gozan+oxus+amu&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ZDHOgiLp1e&amp;sig=Du0XLu3_E3vhhGiArc3JU_iqJHk&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=CBHhTPm6IYnsuAPGkKjYDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=allintext%3A%20%3D%20gozan%20oxus%20amu&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=&quot;The Kingdom of Afghanistan: a historical sketch By George Passman Tate&quot;&gt;http://library.du.ac.in/dspace/bitstream/1/4715/4/Ch.1 The kingdom of Afghanistan (page 1-87).pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[classical antiquity]], the river was known as the ''≈åxus'' in [[Latin language|Latin]] and [[wikt:·ΩÆŒæŒøœÇ|·ΩÆŒæŒøœÇ]] ''Oxos'' in [[Greek language|Greek]] ‚Äî a clear derivative of [[Vakhsh River|Vakhsh]] &amp;mdash; the name of the largest tributary of the river. In [[Middle Persian]] sources of the [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid period]] the river is known as ''Wehr≈çd''&lt;ref name=&quot;Iranica&quot; /&gt; (lit. &quot;good river&quot;). 

The name ''Amu'' is said to have come from the medieval city of ''ƒÄmul'', (later, Chahar Joy/Charjunow, and now known as [[T√ºrkmenabat]]), in modern [[Turkmenistan]], with ''Darya'' being the Persian word for &quot;river&quot;.

Medieval [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Muslim]] sources call the river ''Jayhoun'' (ÿ¨Ÿäÿ≠ŸàŸÜ) which is derived from ''[[Gihon]]'', the biblical name for one of the four rivers of the [[Garden of Eden]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ref1&quot;&gt;William C. Brice. 1981. ''Historical Atlas of Islam (Hardcover)''. Leiden with support and patronage from Encyclopaedia of Islam. ISBN 90-04-06116-9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ref2&quot;&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9007285 Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online: Amu Darya]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Amu Darya is a river almost in reverse, for long reputed to be sourced by a powerful glacier fed stream high in the Pamir Knot at the eastern end of [[Afghanistan]]'s [[Wakhan Corridor]], and ending not at the sea but spreading out into the sands of Turkmenistan's [[Kyzyl Kum]] desert, well short of its historic terminus of the inland [[Aral Sea]].

==In Ahadith==
In the traditions of the Islamic prophet Muhammad (ahadith), the river is called by the name Jayhan (arabic form of its ancient name Gozan).&lt;ref name=&quot;The introductory chapters of YƒÅq≈´t's Mu øjam al-buldƒÅn&quot;&gt;The introductory chapters of YƒÅq≈´t's Mu øjam al-buldƒÅn, by YƒÅq≈´t ibn  øAbd AllƒÅh al-·∏§amawƒ´, Page 30&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|According to Ibn Hanbal's version of this hadith: &lt;br&gt;
&quot;Four rivers gush forth from Paradise: the Euphrates, the Nile, the Sayhan, and the Jayhan&quot; &lt;br&gt;
(Musnad, II, 260-261). |[[The introductory chapters of YƒÅq≈´t's Mu øjam al-buldƒÅn]]|[[Page 30]]}}

==As the river Gozan==
Historians tell us that one of the most ancient names for the Oxus or Amu in ancient Afghanistan was Gozan. A name used by Greek, Mongol, Chinese, Persian, Jewish and Afghan historians. However, this name is no longer used.

:''&quot;Hara (Bokhara) and to the river of Gozan (that is to say, the Amu, (called by Europeans the Oxus)....&quot;''. &lt;ref name=&quot;The Kingdom of Afghanistan: a historical sketch&quot;&gt;The Kingdom of Afghanistan: a historical sketch, By George Passman Tate, Page 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

:''&quot;the Gozan River is the River Balkh, i.e. the Oxus or the Amu Darya.....&quot;''. &lt;ref name=&quot;Jews in Islamic countries in the Middle Ages&quot;&gt;Jews in Islamic countries in the Middle Ages, By Moshe Gil, David Strassler,  Page 428.&lt;/ref&gt;

:''&quot;... and were brought into Halah (modern day Balkh), and Habor (which is Pesh Habor or Peshawar), and Hara (which is Herat), and to the river Gozan (which is the Ammoo, also called Jehoon)...&quot;''. &lt;ref name=&quot;Tamerlane and the Jews&quot;&gt;Tamerlane and the Jews, By Michael Shterenshis, Page xxiv.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[Image:Aral map.png|thumb|250px|left|Map of area around the Aral Sea. Aral Sea boundaries are circa 1960. Countries at least partially in the Aral Sea watershed are in yellow.]]

The river's total length is {{convert|2400|km|mi}} and its drainage basin totals {{convert|534739|km2|sqmi}} in area, providing a mean discharge of around {{convert|97.4|km3|cumi}}&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt; of water per year. The river is navigable for over {{convert|1450|km|mi}}. All of the water comes from the high mountains in the south where annual [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] can be over {{convert|1000|mm|in|abbr=on}}. Even before large-scale irrigation began, high summer evaporation meant that not all of this discharge reached the [[Aral Sea]] - though there is some evidence the large Pamir [[glacier]]s provided enough melt water for the Aral to overflow during the 13th and 14th centuries A.D.

One source of the Amu Darya is the [[Pamir River]], which emerges from Lake [[Zorkul]] (once also known as Lake Victoria) in the [[Pamir Mountains]] (ancient [[Mount Imeon]]), and flows west to Qila-e Panja, where it joins the [[Wakhan River]] to form the '''[[Panj River]]'''. 

Another claimed source of the Amu Darya is an ice cave at the end of the [[Wakhjir]] valley, in the [[Wakhan Corridor]], in the [[Pamir Mountains]], near the border with Pakistan. A [[glacier]] turns into the Wakhan River and joins the Pamir River about {{convert|50|km}} downstream&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mockandoneil.com/stg04r3.htm#oxus J. Mock and K. O'Neil (2004): Expedition Report]&lt;/ref&gt;).

The Panj River forms the border of [[Afghanistan]] and [[Tajikistan]]. It flows west to [[Ishkashim, Afghanistan|Ishkashim]] where it turns north and then east north-west through the [[Pamirs]] passing the [[Tajik-Afghan Friendship Bridge]]. It subsequently forms the border of Afghanistan and [[Uzbekistan]] for about {{convert|200|km}}, passing [[Termez]] and the [[Afghanistan-Uzbekistan Friendship Bridge]]. It delineates the border of Afghanistan and [[Turkmenistan]] for another {{convert|100|km}} before it flows into Turkmenistan at [[Kerki|Atamyrat]]. As the ''Amudarya'', it flows across Turkmenistan south to north, passing [[T√ºrkmenabat]], and forms the border of Turkmenistan and [[Uzbekistan]] from [[Halkabat]]. It is then split into many waterways that are used to form the [[river delta]] joining the Aral Sea, passing [[Urgench]], [[Da≈üoguz]] and other cities, but it does not reach what is left of the sea anymore and is lost in the desert.

Use of water from the Amu Darya for [[irrigation]] has been a major contributing factor to the shrinking of the Aral Sea since the late 1950s{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}.

Historical records state that in different periods, the river flowed into the [[Aral Sea]] (from the south), the [[Caspian Sea]] (from the east) or both, similar to the [[Syr Darya]] (Jaxartes, in [[Ancient Greek]]).

==Watershed==
About {{convert|1385045|km2|mi2}} of land is drained by the Amu Darya into the Aral Sea [[endorheic basin]]. This includes most of [[Tajikistan]], the southwest corner of [[Kyrgyzstan]], the northeast corner of [[Afghanistan]], a long narrow portion of western [[Turkmenistan]] and about half of [[Uzbekistan]]. Part of the Amu Darya's [[drainage divide]] in Tajikistan forms that country's border with [[China]] (in the east) and [[Pakistan]] (to the south). About 61% of the drainage lies within Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan, while 39% is in Afghanistan.&lt;ref name=&quot;Basin&quot;&gt;

This is because many of the river's major tributaries (especially the [[Zeravshan River]]) have been diverted, and much of the river's drainage is dominated by outlying [[desert]] and [[steppe]]. 

The abundant water flowing in the Amu Darya almost entirely comes from [[glacier]]s in the [[Pamir Mountains]] and [[Tian Shan]],&lt;ref name=&quot;ICWC&quot;&gt;{{cite web

which, standing above the surrounding arid plain, collect atmospheric moisture which otherwise would probably have escaped somewhere else. Without its mountain water sources, the Amu Darya would not contain any water because it rarely rains in the lowlands that characterize most of the river.

==History==
[[Image:KarazinNN PereprTurkOtrARTM.jpg|thumb|right|Russian troops crossing Amu Darya, c. 1873]]
The Amu Darya was called the ''Oxus'' by the ancient [[Greece|Greek]]s. In ancient times, the river was regarded as the boundary between [[Greater Iran|IrƒÅn]] and [[Turan|T≈´rƒÅn]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Iranica&quot;&gt;Spuler, B., [http://www.iranica.com/newsite/index.isc?Article=http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/unicode/v1f9/v1f9a135.html ƒÄM≈™ DARYƒÄ], in [[Encyclop√¶dia Iranica]], online ed., 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The river's drainage lies in the area between the former empires of [[Genghis Khan]] and [[Alexander the Great]], although they occurred at much different times. One southern route of the [[Silk Road]] ran along part of the Amu Darya northwestward from [[Termez]] before going westwards to the [[Caspian Sea]].

It is believed that the Amu Darya's course across the Kara-Kum Desert has gone through several major shifts in the past few thousand years. Much of the time, the most recent period being in the 13th century to the late 16th century, the Amu Darya emptied into both the Aral and the Caspian Seas, the latter via a large [[distributary]] called the [[Uzboy River]]. The Uzboy splits off from the main channel just south of the Amudarya Delta. Sometimes, the flow through the two branches was more or less equal, but often, most of the Amu Darya's flow split to the west and flowed into the Caspian. 

People began to settle along the lower Amu Darya and the Uzboy in the 5th century A.D., establishing a thriving chain of agricultural lands, towns, and cities. The river was impounded in about 985 A.D. at the bifurcation of the forks by the massive Gurganj Dam, which diverted water to the Aral. The dam was destroyed by [[Genghis Khan]]'s troops in 1221, and the Amu Darya shifted its flows more or less equally between the main stem and the Uzboy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oxus&quot;&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=2010-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; But in the 18th century, the river again turned north, flowing into the Aral Sea, a path it has taken since. Less and less water flowed down the Uzboy until, in the 1720s, the river's surface flow completely dried up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The first British explorer to reach the region in the [[Great Game]] period was a naval officer called [[John Wood (explorer)|John Wood]].  He was sent on an expedition to find the source of the river in 1839. He found modern day Lake Zorkul, called it Lake Victoria and proclaimed he had found the source. &lt;ref&gt;Keay, J. (1983) ''When Men and Mountains Meet'' ISBN 0-7126-0196-1 Chapter 9&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Soviet Union]] became the ruling power in the 20th century. The Soviet Union fell in the 1990s and Central Asia split up into the many smaller countries that lie within or partially within the Amu Darya basin. In the 1960s and 1970s, the Amu Darya and Syr Darya were first used by the Soviets to irrigate extensive [[cotton]] fields in the Central Asian plain. Before this time, water from the rivers was already being used for agriculture, but not on this massive scale. The [[Qaraqum Canal]], Karshi Canal, and Bukhara Canal were among the larger of the irrigation diversions built.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

{{quotation|But the majestic River floated on,&lt;br&gt;
Out of the mist and hum of that low land, &lt;br&gt;
Into the frosty starlight, and there moved, &lt;br&gt;
Rejoicing, through the hushed Chorasmian waste,&lt;br&gt;
Under the solitary moon: ‚Äî he flowed &lt;br&gt;
Right for the polar star, past Orgunj√®,&lt;br&gt;
Brimming, and bright, and large: then sands begin &lt;br&gt;
To hem his watery march, and dam his streams, &lt;br&gt;
And split his currents; that for many a league &lt;br&gt;
The shorn and parcelled Oxus strains along &lt;br&gt;
Through beds of sand and matted rushy isles ‚Äî &lt;br&gt;
Oxus, forgetting the bright speed he had &lt;br&gt;
In his high mountain-cradle in Pamere, &lt;br&gt;
A foiled circuitous wanderer: ‚Äî till at last &lt;br&gt;

{{History of Afghanistan}}
The '''Islamic conquest of Afghanistan''' (642‚Äì870) began in the middle of the 7th century&lt;ref name=&quot;Romano&quot;&gt;A Historical Atlas of Afghanistan (2003), by Amy Romano, pg. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; after the [[Islamic conquest of Persia]] was completed, when [[Arab people|Arab]] [[Muslim]]s defeated the [[Sassanid Empire]] at the battles of [[Battle of Walaja|Walaja]], [[Battle of al-QƒÅdisiyyah|al-QƒÅdisiyyah]] and [[Battle of NihawƒÅnd|Nahavand]].&lt;ref name=&quot;LC&quot;&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+af0006) ''Islamic Conquest''], [[Library of Congress Country Studies]] on Afghanistan&lt;/ref&gt; The Muslim Arabs then began to move towards the lands east of [[Persia]] and in 642 captured the city, [[Herat]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot;&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/7798/Afghanistan Afghanistan, ''The 7th-18th centuries''], [[Encyclop√¶dia Britannica]]&lt;/ref&gt; By 667 AD the [[Afghan (name)|Afghan]] area was under invasion by the Arabs but in 683 [[Kabul]] revolted and completely routed the invading army which was led by the Governor of Seistan. It was not until 870 that Kabul and the Afghan area were conquered by the Arabs.&lt;ref name=&quot;SNS&quot;&gt;Ancient Indian History and Civilization, by Sailendra Nath Sen, p 347.&lt;/ref&gt; The complete conversion of [[Afghanistan]] to [[Islam]] was during the period of the [[Ghaznavids]], in or about the 11th century.{{so?}}

==Caliphate==
{{See|Caliphate}}
[[File:Ancient Khorasan highlighted.jpg|thumb|left|Names of territories during the [[Caliphate]]]]
The invasion of Persia was completed five years after the death of the [[Prophets of Islam|Islamic Prophet]] [[Muhammad]], and all of the Persian territories came under Arab control, though pockets of tribal resistance continued for centuries in the [[Afghan (name)|Afghan]] territories.&lt;ref name=&quot;LC&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot;/&gt; During the 7th century, [[Umayyad|Arab armies]] made their way into the region of Afghanistan from [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] with the new religion of [[Islam]]. At this point in time the area that is currently Afghanistan had a multi-religious population consisting of [[Hindu]]s, [[Buddhist]]s, [[Zoroastrian]]s, [[Jews]], and others.

Part of the region was ruled by [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] [[Hindu]]/[[Buddhist]] dynasty called the [[Kabul Shahi]]s since the 5th century AD. The Arabs were unable to succeed in converting the population of that area because of constant revolts from the mountain tribes. In 870, [[Ya'qub-i Laith Saffari]], a local [[Tajik people|Persian]]&lt;ref&gt;''The Encyclopedia of world history'', Editors Peter N. Stearns and William Leonard Langer, (Houghton Mifflin Company, 2001), 115&lt;/ref&gt; ruler from the [[Saffarids|Saffarid dynasty]] of [[Zaranj]], conquered most of the cities of present-day Afghanistan in the name of Islam. {{quote|Arab armies carrying the banner of Islam came out of the west to defeat the [[Sasanians]] in [[642|642 AD]] and then they marched with confidence to the east. On the western periphery of the [[Afghan (name)|Afghan]] area the princes of [[Herat]] and [[Seistan]] gave way to rule by Arab governors but in the east, in the mountains, cities submitted only to rise in revolt and the hastily converted returned to their old beliefs once the armies passed. The harshness and avariciousness of Arab rule produced such unrest, however, that once the waning power of the [[Caliphate]] became apparent, native rulers once again established themselves independent. Among these the [[Saffarids]] of Seistan shone briefly in the Afghan area. The fanatic founder of this dynasty, the coppersmith‚Äôs apprentice Yaqub ibn Layth Saffari, came forth from his capital at Zaranj in 870 AD and marched through [[Bost]], [[Kandahar]], [[Ghazni]], [[Kabul]], [[Bamyan]], [[Balkh]] and [[Herat]], conquering in the name of Islam.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dupree&quot;&gt;[[Nancy Hatch Dupree|Dupree, Nancy Hatch]] (1971) &quot;Sites in Perspective (Chapter 3)&quot; ''An Historical Guide To Afghanistan'' Afghan Tourist Organization, Kabul, [http://worldcat.org/oclc/241390 OCLC 241390]&lt;/ref&gt;|[[Nancy Hatch Dupree]]|1971}}

During the eighth through the ninth centuries, many inhabitants of what is present-day [[Afghanistan]] and western [[Pakistan]] were converted to [[Sunni Islam]].&lt;ref name=&quot;SNS&quot; /&gt; In some cases, however, people that were conquered by the Muslims would rebel and revert to prior forms of worship.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dupree&quot; /&gt; The mountain areas were still not completely converted and remained largely by people of non-Muslim faiths. In a book called [[Hudud ul-'alam|Hudud-al-Alam]], written in 982 CE, it mentions a village near [[Jalalabad]], Afghanistan, where the local king used to have many Hindu, Muslim and Afghan wives.&lt;ref name=&quot;WV&quot;&gt;Willem Vogelsang, ''The Afghans'', Edition: illustrated Published by Wiley-Blackwell, 2002, Page 18, ISBN 0631198415, 9780631198413 ([http://books.google.com/books?id=9kfJ6MlMsJQC&amp;pg=RA1-PA18&amp;lpg=RA1-PA18&amp;dq=Hindu+Pashtuns&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=53eiiBfFg-&amp;sig=Gg8zdnCCGM8oM5rBiRWbVmURUmo&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=0CXsSa3QHOOwtgf7y9iXBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10#PRA1-PA18,M1 LINK])&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote|In the eighth and ninth centuries ancestors of many of today's Turkic-speaking Afghans settled in the Hindu Kush area (partly to obtain better grazing land) and began to assimilate much of the culture and language of the [[Pashtun tribes]] already present there...&lt;ref name=&quot;LC&quot; /&gt;}}

===Ghaznavids and Ghurids===
{{Main|Ghaznavids|Ghurid Dynasty}}
Out of the [[Samanids|Samanid dynasty]] came the [[Ghaznavids]], whose warriors forged the first great Islamic empire from [[Ghazni]] (Afghanistan) that spanned much of the Iranian plateau, [[Central Asia]] and conducted many successful raids into [[India]]. During the end of the ninth century, the Samanids extended its rule from [[Bukhara]] to as far south as the [[Indus River]] and west into most of Persia. By the mid-tenth century, the Samanid dynasty had crumble in the face of attacks from [[Turkic peoples|Turkish tribes]] to the north and from the Ghaznavids, a rising [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] Muslim dynasty in Afghanistan. Besides Turkic people, large part of the Ghaznavid Empire was made up of local Muslim Afghans from what is now Afghanistan and western parts of Pakistan.

It is surmised from the writings of [[Al Biruni]] that some Afghans who lived in west of India (modern-day [[Afghanistan]]) had not been completely converted to Islam. Al Biruni, writing in Tarikh al Hind, also alludes to those Afghan tribes as being neither Muslim nor Hindu, but simply Afghans.{{quote|The most explicit mentioning of the Afghans appears in Al- Baruni‚Äôs Tarikh al hind (eleventh century AD). Here it is said that various tribes of Afghans lived in the mountains in the west of [[Hindustan|India]]. Al Baruni adds that they were savage people and he describes them as Hindus.&lt;ref name=&quot;WV&quot; /&gt;|Willem Vogelsang|2002}}

{{quote|Al Beruni mentions the Afghans once (''ed Sachau, I 208'') saying that in the western mountains of India live various tribes of Afghans who extend to the neighbourhood of the [[Sindh]] (i.e., [[Indus]]) valley. Thus in the eleventh century when the Afghans are first mentioned, they are found occupying the [[Sulaiman Mountains]] now occupied by their descendants, the very tribes which the advocates of the exclusive claims of the Durannis will not admit to be true Afghans. Al Beruni no doubt also alludes to them in the passage (''loc. Cit. p 199'') where he says that rebellious savage races, tribes of Hindus, or akin to them inhabit the mountains which form the frontier of India towards the west.&lt;ref&gt;A Glossary Of The Tribes And Castes Of The Punjab And North-West Frontier Province Vol. 3 By H.A. Rose, Denzil Ibbetson Sir Published by Atlantic Publishers &amp; Distributors, 1997 Page 211 ISBN 8185297703, 9788185297705&lt;/ref&gt;|H.A. Rose|1997}}

Various historical sources such as Martin Ewans, E.J. Brill and [[Firishta|Farishta]] have recorded that the complete conversion of Afghanistan, Pakistan to Islam was during the rule of [[Sultan]] [[Mahmud of Ghazni]]. [[File:Sultan-Mahmud-Ghaznawi.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Sultan]] [[Mahmud of Ghazni]]]]

{{quote|The Arabs advanced through [[Sistan]] and conquered [[Sindh]] early in the eighth century. Elsewhere however their incursions were no more than temporary, and it was not until the rise of the [[Saffarids|Saffarid dynasty]] in the ninth century that the frontiers of Islam effectively reached Ghazni and Kabul. Even then a Hindu dynasty the [[Kabul Shahi|Hindushahis]], held [[Gandhara]] and eastern borders. From the tenth century onwards as Persian language and culture continued to spread into Afghanistan, the focus of power shifted to [[Ghazni]], where a [[Turkic peoples|Turkish]] dynasty, who started by ruling the town for the Samanid dynasty of Bokhara, proceeded to create an empire in their own right. The greatest of the Ghaznavids was [[Mahmud of Ghazni|Muhmad]] who ruled between 998 and 1030. He expelled the Hindus from Ghandhara, made no fewer than 17 raids into India. He encouraged mass conversions to Islam, in India as well as in Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;Afghanistan: a new history By Martin Ewans Edition: 2, illustrated Published by Routledge, 2002 Page 15 ISBN 0415298261, 9780415298261&lt;/ref&gt;|Martin Ewans|2002}}

[[Muhammad al-Idrisi|Al-Idirisi]] testifies that until as late as the 12th century, a contract of investiture for every Shahi king was performed at Kabul and that here he was obliged to agree to certain ancient conditions which completed the contract.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Idrisi, p 67, Maqbul Ahmed; Al-Hind, the Making of the Indo-Islamic World, 1991, p 127, Andre Wink.&lt;/ref&gt; The Ghaznavid military incursions assured the domination of [[Sunni Islam]] in what is now Afghanistan and western Pakistan. The most renowned of the dynasty's rulers was Mahmud of Ghazni, who consolidated control over the areas south of the [[Amu Darya]] then carried out devastating raids into India. With his booty from India, Mahmud built a great capital at [[Ghazni]], founded universities, and patronized scholars. By the time of his death, Mahmud ruled a vast empire that stretched from [[Kurdistan]] to the entire [[Hindu Kush]] region as far east as the [[Punjab region|Punjab]] as well as territories far north of the [[Amu Darya]]. However, as occurred so often in this region, the demise in 1030 of this military genius who had expanded the empire to its farthest reaches was the death knell of the dynasty itself. The rulers of the [[Ghurid Dynasty|Ghurids]] of [[Ghor]] in modern-day Afghanistan, captured and burned Ghazni in 1149, just as the Ghaznavids had once conquered Ghor. Not until 1186, however, was the last representative of the Ghaznavids uprooted by the Ghorids from his holdout in [[Lahore]], in the Punjab.

Despite being younger than other claimants, Abdali had several overriding factors in his favor: 
*He was a direct descendant of Asadullah Khan, patriarch of the [[Sadozai (Pastun tribe)|Sadozai]] clan, the most prominent tribe amongst the [[Pashtun people]] at the time;
*He was unquestionably a charismatic leader and seasoned warrior who had at his disposal a trained, mobile force of 4,000 loyal cavalrymen;&lt;ref name=&quot;EB&quot;/&gt;
*Not least, he possessed a substantial part of Nadir Shah's treasury.

One of Abdali's first acts as chief was to adopt the title ''[[Padshah]] durr-i durrƒÅn'' ('[[King]], &quot;pearl of the age&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Afghans |last1=Vogelsang |first1=Willem |authorlink=|coauthors=|volume=|year=2003|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |location=|isbn=0631198415, 9780631198413|page=229|pages=382|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=9kfJ6MlMsJQC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |accessdate=2010-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; or &quot;pearl of pearls&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;EB&quot;/&gt; The name may have been suggested, as some claim, from Abdali's dream, or as others claim, from the pearl earrings worn by the royal guard of Nadir Shah. The Abdali Pashtuns were known thereafter as the [[Durrani]], and the name of the Abdali confederation was changed to Durrani.

Ahmad Shah began his rule by capturing [[Ghazni]] from the [[Ghilzai]]s, and then wresting [[Kabul]] from the local ruler. In 1749, the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] ruler was induced to cede [[Sindh Province|Sindh]], the [[Punjab region]] and the important trans [[Indus River]] to Ahmad Shah in order to save his capital from Afghan attack. Having thus gained substantial territories to the east without a fight, Ahmad Shah turned westward to take possession of [[Herat Province|Herat]], which was ruled by Nader Shah's grandson, [[Shah Rukh of Persia]]. Herat fell to Ahmad after almost a year of siege and bloody conflict, as did [[Mashhad]] (in present-day Iran). Ahmad Shah next sent an army to subdue the areas north of the Hindu Kush mountains. In short order, the powerful army brought under its control the [[Turkmen people|Turkmen]], [[Uzbeks|Uzbek]], [[TƒÅjik people|Tajik]] and [[Hazara people|Hazaras]] tribes of northern Afghanistan. Ahmad invaded the remnants of the [[Mughal Empire]] a third time, and then a fourth, consolidating control over the [[Punjab region|Punjab]] and [[Kashmir]] regions. Then, early in 1757, he sacked [[Delhi]], but permitted the Mughal dynasty to remain in nominal control of the city as long as the ruler acknowledged Ahmad Shah's suzerainty over Punjab, Sindh, and Kashmir. Leaving his second son [[Timur Shah]] to safeguard his interests, Ahmad Shah left India to return to Afghanistan.

===East Turkistan and the Uyghurs===
Sympathizing with the plight of the [[Uyghurs]], whose lands were conquered by the [[Qing]] dynasty, Ahmad Shah attempted to rally neighboring Muslim nations to check Qing expansion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Holy war in China: the Muslim rebellion and state in Chinese Central Asia, 1864-1877 |last1=Kim |first1=Ho-dong |authorlink=|coauthors=|volume=|year=2004|publisher=Stanford University Press |location=|isbn=0804748845, 9780804748841 |page=20|pages=295|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=9kfJ6MlMsJQC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |accessdate=2010-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ahmad Shah halted trade with Qing China and dispatched troops to [[Kokand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Empire and the Khanate: a political history of Qing relations with Khoqand c. 1760-1860 |last1=Newby |first1=Laura J. |authorlink=|coauthors=|volume=|year=2005|publisher=BRILL |location=|isbn=9004145508, 9789004145504 |page=34|pages=297|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=KTmO416hNQ8C&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |accessdate=2010-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, with his campaigns in India exhausting the state treasury, and with his troops stretched thin throughout Central Asia, Ahmad Shah lacked sufficient resources to check the advance of Qing forces. In an effort to alleviate the situation in [[East Turkistan]], Ahmad Shah sent envoys to [[Beijing]], but the talks did not yield favorable results for the Uyghurs.

===Third Battle of Panipat===
{{main|Third Battle of Panipat}}
The Mughal power in northern India had been declining since the reign of [[Aurangzeb]], who died in 1707; In 1751-52, ''Ahamdiya'' treaty was signed between the [[Maratha Empire|Marathas]] and [[Mughals]], when [[Balaji Bajirao]] was the [[Peshwa]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Panipat&quot;&gt;Patil, Vishwas. ''Panipat''.&lt;/ref&gt; Through this treaty, the Marathas controlled virtually the whole of India from their capital at [[Pune]] and Mughal rule was restricted only to Delhi(Mughals remained the nominal heads of Delhi). Marathas were now straining to expand their area of control towards the Northwest of India. Ahmad Shah sacked the Mughal capital and withdrew with the booty he coveted. To counter the Afghans, Peshwa [[Balaji Bajirao]] sent [[Raghunathrao]]. He succeeded in ousting [[Timur Shah]] and his court from India and brought Lahore, Multan, Kashmir and other subahs on the Indian side of Attock under Maratha rule.&lt;ref name=K.RoyIHB&gt;{{cite book | last=Roy |first=Kaushik |title=India's Historic Battles: From Alexander the Great to Kargil |publisher=Permanent Black, India |pages=80‚Äì1 |isbn=978-8178241098}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, upon his return to Kandahar in 1757, Ahmad was forced to return to India and face the formidable attacks of the Maratha Confederacy. 

Ahmad Shah declared a [[jihad]] (or [[Islam]]ic holy war) against the [[Maratha]]s, and warriors from various Pashtun tribes, as well as other tribes such as the [[Baloch people|Baloch]], [[TƒÅjik people|Tajiks]], and Nawabs in India, answered his call. Early skirmishes were followed by victory for the Afghans against the smaller Maratha garrisons in Northwest India and by 1759 Ahmad and his army had reached Lahore and were poised to confront the Marathas. By 1760, the Maratha groups had coalesced into a big enough army under the command of Sadashivrao Bhau. Once again, [[Panipat]] was the scene of a confrontation between two warring contenders for control of [[northern India]]. The [[Third Battle of Panipat]] (January 1761), fought between largely [[Islam|Muslim]] and largely [[Hinduism|Hindu]] armies was waged along a twelve-kilometer front. Despite decisively defeating the Marathas, what might have been Ahmad Shah's peaceful control of his domains was disrupted by other challenges.

===Decline===
[[File:Afghan royal soldiers of the Durrani Empire.jpg|thumb|150px|Afghan royal soldiers of the Durrani Empire.]]
The victory at Panipat was the high point of Ahmad Shah's‚Äîand Afghan‚Äîpower. His Durrani empire was one of the largest Islamic empires in the world at that time. However, even prior to his death, the empire began to unravel. As early as by the end of 1761, the Sikhs had gained power and taken control of much of the Punjab. In 1762, Ahmad Shah crossed the passes from Afghanistan for the sixth time to subdue the [[Sikh Empire|Sikhs]]. He assaulted Lahore and, after taking their holy city of [[Amritsar]], massacred thousands of [[Sikh]] inhabitants, destroying their revered [[Harmandir Sahib|Golden Temple]]. Within two years, the Sikhs rebelled again and rebuilt their holy city of Amritsar. Ahmad Shah tried several more times to subjugate the Sikhs permanently, but failed. 

Ahmad Shah also faced other rebellions in the north, and eventually he and the Uzbek Emir of [[Emirate of Bukhara|Bukhara]] agreed that the [[Amu Darya]] would mark the division of their lands. Ahmad Shah retired to his home in the mountains east of [[Kandahar]], where he died on (April 14, 1773).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Inside Afghanistan: end of the Taliban era? |last1=Reddy |first1=L.

He earned recognition as Ahmad Shah Baba, or &quot;[[Father of the Nation|Father]]&quot; of Afghanistan.&lt;ref name=&quot;LoC&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Singh&quot;/&gt;

===Forming a nation===
By the time of Ahmad Shah's ascendancy, the Pashtuns included many groups whose origins were obscure; it is commonly believed they descended from ancient [[Aryan]] tribes, some, such as the Ghilzai, believe they may have intermingled with [[Turkic peoples|Turks]], and some believe to be descendents of the Israelites that might have settled in the [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] areas. The Durranis are Persianized in culture due to their contacts with the nearby Persians. What they had in common was their education and love of Islam. To the east, the [[Wazir (Tribe)|Waziris]] and their close relatives, the [[Mahsud]]s, had lived in the hills of the central [[Sulaiman Mountains]] since the 14th century. By the end of the 16th century, when the final Turkish-[[Mongol]] invasions occurred, tribes such as the [[Shinwari tribe|Shinwaris]], [[Yousafzai|Yusufzais]] and [[Mohmand]]s had moved from the upper [[Kabul River]] valley into the valleys and plains west, north, and northeast of [[Peshawar]]. The [[Afridi (Pashtun)|Afridis]] had long been established in the hills and mountain ranges south of the [[Khyber Pass]]. By the end of the eighteenth century, the Durranis had blanketed the area west and north of Kandahar and were to be found as far east as [[Quetta]], [[Baluchistan (Chief Commissioners Province)|Baluchistan]].

==Other Durrani rulers (1772-1826)==
{{History of Afghanistan}}
{{Pashtuns}}
[[Ahmed Shah Abdali|Ahmad Shah]]'s successors governed so ineptly during a period of profound unrest that within fifty years of his death, the Durrani empire ''per se'' was at an end, and [[Afghanistan]] was embroiled in civil war. Much of the territory conquered by Ahmad Shah fell to others in this half century. By 1818, the [[Sadozai (Pastun tribe)|Sadozai]] rulers who succeeded Ahmad Shah controlled little more than [[Kabul]] and the surrounding territory within a 160-kilometer radius. They not only lost the outlying territories but also alienated other tribes and lineages among the Durrani Pashtuns.

===Timur Shah (1772-1793)===
{{main|Timur Shah Durrani}}

Ahmad Shah was succeeded by his son, [[Timur Shah]], who had been deputed to administer his fathers conquests in [[northern India]], but had been driven out by the Marathas. Upon Ahmad Shah's death, the Durrani chieftains only reluctantly accepted Timur's accession. Most of his reign was spent fighting a civil war and resisting rebellion; Timur was even forced to move his capital from [[Kandahar]] to [[Kabul]] due to insurgency. Timur Shah proved an ineffectual ruler, during whose reign the Durrani empire began to crumble. He is notable for having had 24 sons, several of whom became rulers of the Durrani territories. Timur died in 1793, and was then succeeded by his fifth son Zaman Shah

===Zaman Shah (1793-1801)===
{{Main|Zaman Shah Durrani}}

After the death of Timur Shah, three of his sons, the governors of Kandahar, Herat and Kabul, contended for the succession. [[Zaman Shah]], governor of Kabul, held the field by virtue of being in control of the capital, and became shah at the age of twenty-three. Many of his half-brothers were imprisoned on their arrival in the capital for the purpose, ironically, of electing a new shah. The quarrels among Timur's descendants that threw Afghanistan into turmoil also provided the pretext for the intervention of outside forces.

The efforts of the Sadozai heirs of Timur to impose a true monarchy on the truculent Pashtun tribes, and their efforts to rule absolutely and without the advice of the other major Pashtun tribal leaders, were ultimately unsuccessful. The [[Sikhs]] became particularly troublesome, and after several unsuccessful efforts to subdue them, Zaman Shah made the mistake of appointing a forceful young Sikh chief, [[Ranjit Singh]], as his governor in the Punjab. This &quot;one-eyed&quot; warrior would later become an implacable enemy of Pashtun rulers in Afghanistan.

Zaman's downfall was triggered by his attempts to consolidate power. Although it had been through the support of the Barakzai chief, Painda Khan Barakzai, that he had come to the throne, Zaman soon began to remove prominent Barakzai leaders from positions of power and replace them with men of his own lineage, the Sadozai. This upset the delicate balance of Durrani tribal politics that Ahmad Shah had established and may have prompted Painda Khan and other Durrani chiefs to plot against the shah. Painda Khan and the chiefs of the [[Nurzai]] and the [[Alizai tribe|Alizai]] Durrani clans were executed, as was the chief of the [[Qizilbash]] clan. Painda Khan's son fled to Iran and pledged the substantial support of his Barakzai followers to a rival claimant to the throne, Zaman's older brother, [[Mahmud Shah Durrani|Mahmud Shah]]. The clans of the chiefs Zaman had executed joined forces with the rebels, and they took Kandahar without bloodshed.

===Mahmud Shah (first reign, 1801-1803)===
{{main|Mahmud Shah Durrani}}
Zeman Shah's overthrow in 1801 was not the end of civil strife in Afghanistan, but the beginning of even greater violence. [[Mahmud Shah Durrani|Mahmud Shah's]] first reign lasted for only two years before he was replaced by [[Shuja Shah Durrani|Shuja Shah]].

===Shuja Shah (1803-1809)===
{{Main|Shuja Shah Durrani}}
Yet another of Timur Shah's sons, Shuja Shah (or Shah Shuja), ruled for only six years. On June 7, 1809, Shuja Shah signed a treaty with the [[British East India Company|British]], which included a clause stating that he would oppose the passage of foreign troops through his territories. This agreement, the first Afghan pact with a [[Europe]]an power, stipulated joint action in case of [[France|Franco]]-Persian aggression against Afghan or British dominions. Only a few weeks after signing the agreement, Shuja was deposed by his predecessor, Mahmud. Much later, he was reinstated by the British, ruling during 1839-1842. Two of his sons also ruled for a brief period in 1842.

===Mahmud Shah (second reign, 1809-1818)===
{{main|Mahmud Shah Durrani}}

Mahmud's second reign lasted nine years. Mahmud alienated the Barakzai, especially Fateh Khan, the son of Painda Khan, who was eventually seized and blinded. Revenge would later be sought and obtained by Fateh Khan's youngest brother, [[Dost Mohammad Khan]].

===Sultan Ali Shah (1818-1819)===
{{Main|Ali Shah Durrani}}
Ali Shah was another son of [[Timur Shah Durrani|Timur Shah]]. He seized power for a brief period in 1818-19.

===Ayub Shah (1819-1823?)===
{{Main|Ayub Shah Durrani}}

Ayub Shah was another son of Timur Shah, who deposed Sultan Ali Shah. He was himself deposed, and presumably killed, in 1823. The loss of [[Kashmir]] during his reign opened a new chapter in Indian history.

'''AymƒÅq''' ({{lang-fa|ÿß€åŸÖÿßŸÇ}}), also transliterated as ''Aimak'' or ''Aimaq'', are a collection of [[Persian language|Persian]]-speaking [[nomad]]ic or semi-nomadic tribes of [[Iranian people|Iranian]]{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} stock. They are found throughout the north and northwest [[Highland (geography)|highland]]s of [[Afghanistan]], immediately to the north of [[Herat]], and in the [[Khorasan Province]] of [[Iran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Janata|first=A. |editor= [[Ehsan Yarshater]]|encyclopedia= [[Encyclop√¶dia Iranica]]|title= AYMƒÄQ|url=http://www.iranica.com/newsite/index.isc?Article=http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/unicode/v3f2/v3f2a038.html |edition= Online Edition|publisher= [[Columbia University]]|location= United States}}&lt;/ref&gt; They speak a number of subdialects of the [[Aimaq dialect]] of [[Persian language|Persian]]. 

Aimaks were originally known as ''chahar'' (&quot;four&quot;) Aymaqs:  the [[Taimani]] (the main element in the population of [[Ghor]]), the [[Ferozkohi]], the [[Temuri]], and the [[Jamshidi (tribe)|Jamshidi]].  Other sources state that the &quot;Aimaq-Hazara&quot; are one of the ''Chahar'', with the Temuri instead being of the &quot;lesser Aimaqs&quot; or ''Aimaq-e digar''&lt;ref name=&quot;Vogelsang2002&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Willem Vogelsang|title=The Afghans|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=9kfJ6MlMsJQC&amp;pg=PA37|accessdate=1 April 2011|year=2002|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=9780631198413|pages=37‚Äì}}&lt;/ref&gt; (&quot;other Aimaqs&quot;) along with the Tahiri, Zuri, Maleki, and Mishmast.&lt;ref name=&quot;Khanam2005&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=R.

==Origin and classification==
Aimaks are closely related to [[TƒÅjik people|Tajiks]] and [[Hazara people|Hazara]] in varying degrees. In the Afghan [[census]], Aimaks are classified as Tajiks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nps.edu/Programs/CCs/Ghor/Ghor.html Aimak, Ghor province on NPS]&lt;/ref&gt; Aimaks live in parts of western and central Afghanistan, making up the majority in [[Ghor Province|Ghor]], and also live in large numbers in the western areas of [[Herat Province|Herat]] and [[Badghis Province|Badghis]], and to a lesser extent in [[Farah Province|Farah]], [[Faryab Province|Faryab]], [[Jowzjan Province|Jowzjan]], and [[Sar-e Pol Province|Sar-e Pol]]. The word &quot;AymƒÅq&quot; is Mongolian meaning &quot;tribe&quot; or &quot;grazing territory&quot;. Attempts to link it somehow with Ancient Iranian semi-god patriarch Yima or Jamshid lack both linguistic and historical foundations.

==Demographics==
Estimates of the Aimaq population vary between 250,000 and 2 million. They are [[Sunni]] Muslims, in contrast to the Hazara, who are [[Shia]]s. The Temuri Aimaqs are of Mongolian origin, apparent in their physical appearance and their housing (Mongolian-style [[yurt]]s).&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Afghanistan&quot;. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Ultimate Reference Suite.  Chicago: Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Taimanis, Ferozkohis, and Jamshidis are of non-Mongolian origins and refer to themselves as Tajik; the majority of the Aimaqs in Afghanistan are from these latter three sub-groups.

To the naked eye, orangey-yellow Arcturus has a [[visual magnitude]] of&amp;nbsp;‚àí0.04, making it the brightest star in the northern hemisphere and the [[list of brightest stars|fourth brightest star]] in the [[night sky]], after -1.46&amp;nbsp;magnitude [[Sirius]], -0.86 magnitude [[Canopus (star)|Canopus]] and -0.27&amp;nbsp;magnitude [[Alpha Centauri]]. However, Alpha Centauri is a bright binary star, whose unresolved components to the naked eye are both fainter than Arcturus. This makes Arcturus the [[list of brightest stars|third brightest ''individual'' star]], just ahead of Alpha Centauri&amp;nbsp;A  (Œ±&amp;nbsp;Cen&amp;nbsp;A), whose visual magnitude is&amp;nbsp;‚àí0.01. 

Arcturus is visible from both hemispheres in the sky, as it is located less than 20 degrees north of the [[celestial equator]]. The star [[culmination|culminates]] at midnight on about the 30th April, being visible during the northern spring or the southern autumn. From the northern hemisphere, an easy way to find Arcturus is to follow the arc of the handle of the [[Big Dipper]]. By continuing in this path, one can find [[Spica]], &quot;Arc to Arcturus, then speed on to [[Spica]].&quot; The star is also a member of the [[Local Interstellar Cloud]].

==Observational history==
As one of the brightest stars in the sky, Arcturus has been significant to observers since antiquity. In Ancient Greece, the star's celestial activity was supposed to portend tempestuous weather. For citations, see [[Plautus]] Rudens prol.&amp;nbsp;71 and [[Lewis and Short]]'s Latin Dictionary and its entry for Arcturus.

Prehistoric [[Polynesian navigation|Polynesian navigators]] knew Arcturus as '''H≈çk≈´le ªa''', the &quot;Star of Joy&quot;. Arcturus is the [[zenith]] star of the [[Hawaiian Islands]]. Using H≈çk≈´le ªa and other stars, the Polynesians launched their double-hulled [[canoe]]s from [[Tahiti]] and the [[Marquesas Islands]]. Traveling east and north they eventually crossed the [[equator]] and reached the [[latitude]] at which Arcturus would appear directly overhead in the summer [[night sky]]. Knowing they had arrived at the exact latitude of the island chain, they sailed due west on the [[trade wind]]s to landfall. If H≈çk≈´le ªa could be kept directly overhead, they landed on the southeastern shores of the [[Hawaii (island)|Big Island]] of [[Hawai ªi]]. For a return trip to Tahiti the navigators could use [[Sirius]], the zenith star of that island. Since 1976, the [[Polynesian Voyaging Society]]'s ''[[Hokulea|H≈çk≈´le‚Äòa]]'' has crossed the Pacific Ocean many times under navigators who have incorporated this [[wayfinding]] technique in their non-instrument navigation.

The [[Koori]] people of southeastern Australia knew Arcturus as ''Marpean-kurrk'', and its appearance in the north signified the arrival of larvae of the wood-ant (a food item) in spring. The beginning of summer was marked by the star's setting with the sun in the west and the disappearance of the larvae. The star was also known as the mother of ''Djuit'' ([[Antares]]), and another star in Bootes, Weet-kurrk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mudrooroo|title=Aboriginal mythology : an A-Z spanning the history of aboriginal mythology from the earliest legends to the present day|publisher=HarperCollins|location=London|year=1994|page=5|isbn=1855383063}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oscillations===
As one of the brightest stars in the sky, Arcturus has been the subject of a number of studies in the emerging field of [[asteroseismology]].

Belmonte et al. (1990) carried out a radial velocity (Doppler shift of spectral lines) study of the star in April and May 1988, which showed variability with a frequency of the order of a few microhertz, the highest peak corresponding to 4.3&amp;nbsp;ŒºHz (2.7&amp;nbsp;days) with an amplitude of 60 ms&lt;sup&gt;‚àí1&lt;/sup&gt;, with a [[frequency separation]] of ~5&amp;nbsp;ŒºHz. They suggested that the most plausible explanation for the variability of Arcturus is stellar oscillations. 

High precision photometry from the ''[[Hipparcos]]'' satellite's observations showed Arcturus is now known to be slightly [[variable star|variable]], by about 0.04&amp;nbsp;magnitudes over 8.3&amp;nbsp;days.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} It is believed that the surface of the star oscillates slightly, a common feature of red giant stars. In the case of Arcturus, this was an interesting discovery as it is known that the redder (more towards or within the M spectral class) a giant gets, the more variable it will be. Extreme cases like [[Mira]] undergo large swings over hundreds of days; Arcturus is not very red and is a borderline case between variability and stability with its short period and tiny range.

==System==

Arcturus is a [[stellar classification|type]] K1.5&amp;nbsp;IIIpe [[orange giant]] star‚Äîthe letters &quot;pe&quot; stand for &quot;peculiar emission,&quot; which indicates that the [[electromagnetic spectrum|spectrum]] of [[light]] given off by the star is unusual and full of [[emission line]]s. This is not too uncommon in red giants, but Arcturus has a particularly strong case of the phenomenon. It is at least 110 times visually more luminous than the [[Sun]], but this underestimates its strength as much of the &quot;light&quot; it gives off is in the [[infrared]]; total power output is about 180&amp;nbsp;times that of the Sun. The lower output in visible light is due to a lower [[Luminous efficacy|efficacy]] as the star has a lower surface temperature than the Sun.

Arcturus is notable for its high [[proper motion]], larger than any first magnitude star in the stellar neighborhood other than [[Alpha Centauri|Œ±&amp;nbsp;Centauri]]. It is moving rapidly ({{nowrap|122 km/s}}) relative to the solar system, and is now almost at its closest point to the Sun. Closest approach will happen in about 4000 years, when the star will be a few hundredths of a light year closer to Earth than it is today. Arcturus is thought to be an old disk star, and appears to be moving with a group of 52 other such stars, known as the [[Arcturus stream]]. Its mass is hard to exactly determine, but may be slightly larger than that of the Sun&lt;ref&gt;Ayres, T. R. &amp; Johnson, H. R., ApJ, 1977, Vol 214, P410-417&lt;/ref&gt; (1.1&lt;sub&gt;-0.4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+0.6&lt;/sup&gt; solar mass). Arcturus is likely to be considerably older than the Sun, and much like how the Sun will be in its red giant phase.

According to the ''[[Hipparcos]]'' satellite, Arcturus is 36.7&amp;nbsp;[[light year]]s (11.3&amp;nbsp;[[parsec]]s) from [[Earth]], relatively close in astronomical terms. ''Hipparcos'' also suggested that Arcturus is a [[binary star]], with the companion about twenty times dimmer than the primary and orbiting close enough to be at the very limits of our current ability to make it out. Recent results remain inconclusive, but do support the marginal ''Hipparcos'' detection of a binary companion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |

==Claims of a planetary system==
In 1993, radial velocity measurements of [[Aldebaran]], Arcturus and [[Pollux (star)|Pollux]] showed that Arcturus exhibited a long-period radial velocity oscillation, which could be interpreted as a ''substellar companion''. This [[substellar]] object would be nearly 12&amp;nbsp;times the mass of [[Jupiter]] and be located roughly within [[Earth]]'s [[orbital zone]], at 1.1&amp;nbsp;[[Astronomical Unit]]s.  However, all three stars surveyed showed similar oscillations yielding similar companion masses, and the authors concluded that the variation was likely to be intrinsic to the star rather than due to the gravitational effect of a companion. So far no substellar companion has been confirmed.&lt;ref name=Kgiants&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1086/173002 | title=Long-period radial velocity variations in three K giants|author=Hatzes, A., Cochran, W.|journal=[[The Astrophysical Journal]]|volume=413 | issue=1 | pages=339‚Äì348 | date=August, 1993 | bibcode=1993ApJ...413..339H}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology and cultural significance==
The name of the star derives from [[Ancient Greek]] ŒëœÅŒ∫œÑŒø·ø¶œÅŒøœÇ (''Arktouros'') and means &quot;Guardian of the Bear&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D*%29arktou%3Dros ŒëœÅŒ∫œÑŒø·ø¶œÅŒøœÇ], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; ultimately from ·ºÑœÅŒ∫œÑŒøœÇ (''arktos''), &quot;bear&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Da%29%2Frktos ·ºÑœÅŒ∫œÑŒøœÇ], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; + Œø·ΩñœÅŒøœÇ (''ouros''), &quot;watcher, guardian&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dou%29%3Dros2 Œø·ΩñœÅŒøœÇ], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; This is a reference to it being the brightest star in the constellation Bo√∂tes (of which it forms the left foot), which is next to the Greater and Lesser Bears, [[Ursa Major]] and [[Ursa Minor]]. 

In [[Arabic language|Arabic]], it is one of two stars called ''al-simƒÅk'' &quot;the uplifted one&quot;, the other being [[Spica]]. Arcturus, then, is ÿßŸÑÿ≥ŸÖÿßŸÉ ÿßŸÑÿ±ÿßŸÖÿ≠ ''as-simƒÅk ar-rƒÅmiƒß'' &quot;the uplifted one of the lancer&quot;.  The term '''Al Simak Al Ramih''' was appeared in Al Achsasi Al Mouakket catalogue, which  was translated into [[Latin]] as '''Al Simak Lanceator'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The name '''Alramih''' is used in [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[Treatise on the Astrolabe]]'' of 1391. Another Arabic name is '''Haris-el-sema''', from '''ÿ≠ÿßÿ±ÿ≥ ÿßŸÑÿ≥ŸÖÿßÿ°''' ''ƒßƒÅris al-samƒÅ‚Äô'' &quot;the keeper of heaven.&quot;&lt;ref name=arabicstar&gt;[http://www.jas.org.jo/arabic/alma.html List of the 25&amp;nbsp;brightest stars], website of the Jordanian Astronomical Society, accessed March 28, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=allen&gt;Richard Hinckley Allen, ''Star-names and their meanings'' (1936), p. 100-101.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=arabicdict&gt;Hans Wehr (J.M.

In [[Chinese astronomy]], Arcturus is called ''Da Jiao'' (Â§ßËßí, Great Horn, [[Pinyin]]: D√†ji«éo), because it is the brightest star in the [[Chinese constellation]] called ''[[Horn (Chinese constellation)|Jiao Xiu]]'' (ËßíÂÆø, Pinyin: Ji«éo Xi«î). And later, it become a part of ''Kang Xiu'' (‰∫¢ÂÆø, Pinyin: K√†ng Xi«î), which is also a Chinese constellation. 

Ancient [[Japan]]ese astronomy adopted the Chinese name ''Da Jiao'' (Â§ßËßí, ''Ro'ku too''), but its western name, Arcturus („Ç¢„É´„ÇØ„Éà„Ç•„É´„Çπ), is more common now.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

In [[Inuit astronomy]], Arcturus is called the Old Man (''Uttuqalualuk'' in [[Inuit]]) and The First Ones (''Sivulliik'' in [[Inuit]]).

It corresponds to the [[Hindu calendar|Hindu]] astronomy [[Nakshatra]] of [[Swati the Star|Swati]].

In Indonesia, Arcturus is called ''Bintang Biduk'' (Star of boat).

* ''[[1933 World's Fair]]''. The star achieved fame when its light was used to open the [[Century of Progress|1933 Chicago World's Fair]]. The star was chosen as it was thought that light from Arcturus had started its journey at about the time of the [[World's Columbian Exposition|previous Chicago World's Fair]] in 1893 (as the star is 36.7&amp;nbsp;light years away the light had, actually, started its journey in 1896).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Century of Progress World's Fair, 1933-1934 | publisher = University of Illinois-Chicago | date = 2008-01 | url = http://collections.carli.illinois.edu/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/uic_cop&amp;CISOPTR=45&amp;CISOBOX=1&amp;REC=1 | accessdate = 2009-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Myths==
This bright star is the subject of numerous ancient and modern myths.

* ''[[Ancient Greece]]''. In Greek mythology, Arcturus is a star created by [[Zeus]] to protect the nearby constellations Arcas{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} and Callisto ([[Ursa Major]] and [[Ursa Minor]]). According to the myth, Callisto was the daughter of Lycaon, the king of Arcadia. As a young girl, she vowed to the goddess [[Artemis]] to be forever faithful and devoted to her. She was to remain a virgin forever in order to serve and accompany Artemis while hunting animals in the forest. However, one day, Zeus, the king of the gods, fell in love with Callisto and raped her. Callisto gave birth to a son whom she named Arcas. Zeus knew that if Hera, his wife, learned of his disloyalty she would be angry with Callisto, so in order to protect her he transformed her into a brown bear. Callisto, as a bear, roamed around the forest looking for her son. After years of searching she found Arcas, who was now a grown man. She finally came upon him and, overjoyed, stood on her hind legs and tried to embrace him. Arcas, however, did not recognize his mother and thought he was being attacked, so he drew his sword to defend himself. Zeus, watching everything, as usual, felt sorry for them and in order to prevent this tragedy he transformed Callisto and Arcas into constellations (now known as Ursa major and Ursa minor) and placed them near to him in the sky. Hera, who had learned the truth and was furious, asked [[Ocean]], the river that surrounds the earth, not to permit them to wash themselves in his waters; therefore these two constellations are always seen high in the night sky, and never drop into the ocean. Moreover, in order to protect them from Hera's jealousy, Zeus placed another star near to them: Arcturus (which means the guardian of Arctos, the bear). It protects and accompanies them for eternity.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

* ''Occult traditions''. In the [[astrology]] of the [[Middle Ages]], Arcturus was one of the 15&amp;nbsp;[[Behenian fixed stars]], associated with [[jasper]] and the [[plantago|plantain]] herb. [[Cornelius Agrippa]] lists its symbol [[Image:Agrippa1531 Alchameth.png]] under the alternate name '''Alchameth'''.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

* In Indian [[Astrology]] or [[Jyoti·π£a|Vedic Astrology]] or [[Sidereal astrology|Sidereal Astrology]], Arcturus is called ''''[[Swati the Star|Swati]]'''' which is a word derived from the language [[Sanskrit]].

* It is taught by a disciple of [[New Age]] [[guru]] [[Jose Arguelles]] on Arguelles‚Äô website that 3,000,000 years ago beings from Arcturus colonized the northern hemisphere of [[Mars]] and beings from [[Antares]] colonized the planet‚Ä≤s southern hemisphere.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lawoftime.org/timeshipearth/arcturus.html Law of Time (Jose Arguelles‚Äô official website)--Timeship Earth 2013‚Äî&quot;Arcturus Remembered&quot;‚ÄîTransmission by ‚ÄúPan Agent‚Äù:]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Androphagi''' (Greek : &quot;·ºàŒΩŒ¥œÅŒøœÜŒ¨Œ≥ŒøŒπ&quot; for &quot;man-eaters&quot;) was an ancient nation of [[cannibalism|cannibals]] north of [[Scythia]] (according to [[Herodotus]]), probably in the forests between the upper waters of the [[Dneiper River|Dnepr]] and [[Don River, Russia|Don]]. These people may have assisted the [[Scythians]] when King [[Darius the Great]] led a Persian invasion into what is now Southern Russia to punish the Scythians for their raids into the [[Achaemenid Empire]].

Due to a [[false etymology]], a popular belief is that they were most likely Finns ‚Äì the obsolete name of  ''[[Nenets people|Nenets]]'' people, ''Samoyed'', has a similar meaning in Russian: &quot;self-eater&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;http://education.yahoo.com/reference/dictionary/entry/Samoyed&lt;/ref&gt;  See [[Nenets]].

The [[Gutasaga]] tells of the [[bl√≥ts]] on the island of Gotland in the Baltic Sea:

:Firi √æan tima oc lengi eptir si√æan. Tro√æu menn a hult. oc a hauga. wi. oc. stafgar√æa. oc a hai√æin gu√æ. blota√æu √æair synnum oc dydrum sinum Oc file√æi. mi√æ matj oc mundgati. √æet gier√æu √æair eptir wantro sinnj. land alt. haf√æi sir hoystu blotan mi√æ fulki. ellar haf√æi huer √æri√æiungr. sir.

This is roughly translated:

:Before this time, and a long time thereafter, they believed in groves and barrows, sanctuaries, and sacred enclosures and in the pagan gods. They sacrificed (for?) their sons, daughters and cattle, and practiced bl√≥ts with food and drink. This they did due to their superstition. The whole country (the [[althing]]) had the largest [[bl√≥t]] with sacrifice of people, otherwise every trithing had its bl√≥t and smaller things had smaller bl√≥ts with cattle, food and drinks. They were called food-, or cooking-brethren, because they prepared the meals together.

'''Albert Lawrence Brooks''' (born '''Albert Lawrence Einstein'''; July 22, 1947) is an American actor, [[voice actor]], writer, comedian and director. He received an [[Academy Award]] nomination in 1987&lt;ref&gt;http://www.filmsite.org/aa87.html&lt;/ref&gt; for his role in ''[[Broadcast News (film)|Broadcast News]]''. His voice acting credits include Marlin the [[clownfish]] in ''[[Finding Nemo]]'' and recurring guest voices for the animated television series ''[[The Simpsons]]'' and Russ Cargill in its [[film adaptation]] ''[[The Simpsons Movie]]''.

==Early life==
Brooks was born in [[Beverly Hills]] [[California]], the son of [[Thelma Leeds]] (n√©e Goodman), a singer and actress, and [[Harry Einstein]], aka Harry Parkyakarkas, a radio comedian who performed on [[Eddie Cantor]]'s radio program and was known as [[Parkyakarkus]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filmreference.com/film/60/Albert-Brooks.html Albert Brooks Biography (1947‚Äì)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; His brothers are comedic actor [[Bob Einstein]], better known by his stage name &quot;[[Super Dave Osborne]]&quot;, and Cliff Einstein, a partner and longtime chief creative officer at Los Angeles advertising agency Dailey &amp; Associates.  His half-brother was Charles Einstein (1926‚Äì2007), a writer who wrote for such television programs as ''[[Playhouse 90]]'' and ''[[Lou Grant (TV series)|Lou Grant]]''. Brooks is Jewish.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.egothemag.com/archives/2006/01/comedy_in_the_m.htm EGO Magazine: Comedy in The Muslim World&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; He grew up among show business royalty in southern California, attending [[Beverly Hills High School]] with the likes of [[Richard Dreyfuss]] and [[Rob Reiner]].&lt;ref&gt;Kaufman, Peter of ''[[The Washington Post]]'', [http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=BN&amp;p_theme=bn&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=10F58714871BD6E8&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM &quot;The background on Albert Brooks&quot;], ''[[The Buffalo News]]'', January 22, 2006. Accessed April 24, 2008. &quot;Albert Brooks, who grew up in a showbiz family and attended Beverly Hills High School, has never been interested in being an outsider.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Albert has no family relation to [[Mel Brooks]].

==Early career==
Brooks attended [[Carnegie Mellon]] in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]], but dropped out after one year to focus on his comedy career. He changed his surname from ''Einstein'' (to avoid confusion with the [[Albert Einstein|famous physicist]]) and began a [[stand-up comedy]] career that quickly made him a regular on [[variety show|variety]] and talk shows during the late 1960s and early 1970s. Brooks led a new generation of self-reflective baby-boomer comics appearing on NBC's  ''The Tonight Show starring [[Johnny Carson]]''. His onstage persona, that of an egotistical, narcissistic, nervous comic, an ironic showbiz insider who punctured himself before an audience by disassembling his mastery of comedic stagecraft, influenced other '70s [[post-modern]] comedians, including [[Steve Martin]], [[Martin Mull]] and [[Andy Kaufman]].

After two successful comedy albums, ''Comedy Minus One'' (1973) and the [[Grammy Award]]-nominated ''A Star Is Bought'' (1975), Brooks left the stand-up circuit to try his hand as a filmmaker; his first film, ''The Famous Comedians School'', was a satiric short that appeared on [[PBS]] and was an early example of the [[mockumentary]] sub-genre. 

In 1975, he directed six short films for the first season of [[NBC]]'s ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'':
*ad:10/11/75 h:''[[George Carlin]]'' ‚Äì &quot;The Impossible Truth&quot;
*ad:10/18/75 h:''[[Paul Simon]]'' ‚Äì failed ''[[Candid Camera]]'' stunts and home movies
*ad:10/25/75 h:''[[Rob Reiner]]'' ‚Äì heart surgery
*ad:11/8/75 h:''[[Candice Bergen]]'' ‚Äì upcoming season
*ad:12/13/75 h:''[[Richard Pryor]] / [[Gil Scott-Heron]]'' ‚Äì sick
*ad:1/9/76 h:''[[Elliott Gould]] / [[Anne Murray]]'' ‚Äì audience test screening

In 1976 he appeared in his first mainstream film role, in [[Martin Scorsese]]'s landmark ''[[Taxi Driver]]'' (Scorsese allowed Brooks to improvise much of his dialogue).  The role reflected Brooks's decision to move to Los Angeles to enter the film business. In an interview, Brooks mentioned a conversation he'd had with ''Taxi Driver'' screenwriter Paul Schrader, in which Schrader said that Brooks's character was the only one in the movie that he could not &quot;understand&quot; ‚Äî a remark that Brooks found amusing, as the movie's antihero was a psychotic loner.

Brooks directed his first feature film, ''[[Real Life (movie)|Real Life]]'', in 1979. The film, in which Brooks obnoxiously films a typical suburban family in an effort to win both an [[Academy award|Oscar]] and a [[Nobel Prize]], was a sendup of [[PBS]]'s ''[[An American Family]]'' documentary. It has also been viewed as foretelling the future emergence of reality television.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.nola.com/davewalker/2009/02/albert_brooks_real_life_film_i.html &quot;Albert Brooks 'Real Life' film is an unexpected classic&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; Brooks also made a cameo appearance in the film ''[[Private Benjamin]]'' (1980), starring [[Goldie Hawn]].

==1980s‚Äì1990s==
Through the 1980s and 1990s, Brooks co-wrote (with longtime collaborator Monica Johnson), directed and starred in a series of well-received comedies, playing variants on his standard neurotic and self-obsessed character. These include [[1981 in film|1981's]] ''[[Modern Romance]]'', where Brooks played a film editor desperate to win back his ex-girlfriend ([[Kathryn Harrold]]). The film received a limited release and ultimately grossed under $3 million domestically,&lt;ref name=&quot;modgross&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/ 
| work=Modern Romance box office | url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=modernromance.htm | accessdate=March 12, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was well received by critics, with one reviewer commenting that the film was &quot;not Brooks at his best, but still amusing&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;modreviews&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/ | work=Modern Romance (1981) | url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/modern_romance/ | accessdate=March 12, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; His best-received film, ''[[Lost in America]]'' (1985), featured Brooks and [[Julie Hagerty]] as a couple who leave their [[yuppie]] lifestyle and drop out of society to live in a motor home as they have always dreamed of doing.  They meet comic disappointment.

Brooks's ''[[Defending Your Life]]'' (1991) placed his lead character in the [[afterlife]], put on trial to justify his human fears and thus determine his cosmic fate. Critics responded to the offbeat premise and the surprising chemistry between Brooks and [[Meryl Streep]] as his post-death love interest. His later efforts did not find large audiences, but still retained Brooks's touch as a filmmaker. He garnered positive reviews for ''[[Mother (1996 film)|Mother]]'' (1996), which starred Brooks as a middle-aged writer moving back home to resolve tensions between himself and his mother ([[Debbie Reynolds]]). [[1999 in film|1999's]] ''[[The Muse (film)|The Muse]]'' featured Brooks as a down-and-out Hollywood screenwriter using the services of an authentic [[muse]] ([[Sharon Stone]]) for inspiration.

Brooks also acted in other writers' and directors' films during the 1980s and 1990s. He had a cameo in the opening scene of ''[[Twilight Zone: The Movie]]'', playing a driver whose passenger ([[Dan Aykroyd]]) has a shocking secret. In [[James L. Brooks]]'s hit ''[[Broadcast News (film)|Broadcast News]]'' (1987), Albert Brooks was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]] as an insecure, supremely ethical [[television network|network TV]] [[reporter]], who offers the rhetorical question, &quot;Wouldn't this be a great world if insecurity and desperation made us more attractive?&quot; He also won positive notices for his role in [[1998 in film|1998's]] ''[[Out of Sight]]'', playing an untrustworthy banker and ex-convict.

==2000s==
Brooks received positive reviews for his portrayal of a dying retail store owner who befriends disillusioned teen [[Leelee Sobieski]] in ''[[My First Mister]]'' (2001). Brooks has appeared as a guest voice on ''[[The Simpsons]]'' five times during its run (always under the name ''A. Brooks''), and is described as the best guest star in the show's history by [[IGN]], particularly for his role as supervillain Hank Scorpio in the episode &quot;[[You Only Move Twice]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.tv.ign.com/articles/730/730566p5.html|title=Top 25 Simpsons Guest Appearances|accessdate=March 25, 2007|author=Goldman, Eric; Iverson, Dan; Zoromski, Brian|publisher=IGN}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brooks continued his voiceover work in [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] and [[Pixar]]'s ''[[Finding Nemo]]'' (2003), as the voice of &quot;Marlin&quot;, one of the film's protagonists; ''Nemo'' is Brooks's largest grossing film to date.

In 2005, his film ''[[Looking for Comedy in the Muslim World]]'' was dropped by [[Sony Pictures]] due to their desire to change the title. [[Warner Independent Pictures]] purchased the film and gave it a limited release in January 2006; the film received mixed reviews and a low box office gross. The movie goes back to the days of Brooks's ''[[Real Life (film)|Real Life]]'', as Brooks once again plays himself, a filmmaker commissioned by the U.S. government to see what makes the [[Muslim]] people laugh, thus sending him on a tour of India and Pakistan.

In 2006 he appeared in the documentary film ''[[Wanderlust (2006 film)|Wanderlust]]'' as David Howard from &quot;Lost in America&quot;. The documentary included many other well known people.

In 2007, he continued his long term collaboration with ''The Simpsons'' by voicing Russ Cargill, the main antagonist of ''[[The Simpsons Movie]]''.

He has played Lenny Botwin, [[Nancy Botwin|Nancy Botwin's]] estranged father-in-law, on [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime's]] television series ''[[Weeds (TV series)|Weeds]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://community.tvguide.com/blog-entry/TVGuide-Editors-Blog/Ausiello-Report/Ausiello-Scoop-Albert/800037445 Weeds Scoop: Albert Brooks Is Nancy's &quot;Dad&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; St. Martin's Press published his first novel, ''[[2030 (novel)|2030]]'', on May 10, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Maslin|first=Janet|title=A Wry Eye on Problems of the Future|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/02/books/albert-brookss-2030-his-first-novel-review.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=May 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 Brooks will be costarring in the motion picture ''[[Drive (2011 film)|Drive]]'' alongside [[Ryan Gosling]] and [[Carey Mulligan]].

==Personal life==
Brooks married [[Kimberly Shlain]], an artist he met through a mutual friend. The couple have two children, Jacob Eli and Claire Elizabeth, and reside in Los Angeles.

'''Antares''' (Œ± Scorpii, Œ± Sco, [[Bayer designation|Alpha]] Scorpii) is a [[red supergiant]] [[star]] in the [[Milky Way]] [[galaxy]] and [[list of brightest stars|the sixteenth brightest star]] in the nighttime sky (sometimes listed as 15th brightest, if the two brighter components of the [[Capella (star)|Capella]] quadruple star system are counted as one star).  Along with [[Aldebaran]], [[Spica]], and [[Regulus]] it is one of the four brightest stars near the [[ecliptic]]. Antares is a slow variable star with an average [[apparent magnitude|magnitude]] of +1.09.&lt;ref name=&quot;simbad&quot; /&gt;

==Properties==
[[Image:Redgiants.svg|thumb|left|200px|Comparison between the red [[supergiant]] Antares and the Sun, shown as the tiny dot toward the upper right. The black circle is the size of the orbit of Mars. [[Arcturus]] is also included in the picture for size comparison.]]
Antares is a [[Stellar classification|class M]] [[supergiant star]], with a radius of approximately [[List of largest known stars|800 times that of the sun]]; if it were placed in the center of our solar system, its outer surface would lie between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. Antares is approximately {{convert|600|ly|pc|abbr=off|lk=on}} from our solar system.  Its visual [[luminosity]] is about 10,000 times that of the [[Sun]], but because the star radiates a considerable part of its energy in the [[infrared]] part of the [[spectrum]], the [[Bolometer|bolometric]] luminosity equals roughly 65,000 times that of the Sun. The mass of the star is calculated to be 15 to 18 [[solar mass]]es.&lt;ref name=&quot;kaler&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|last=Kaler|first=James|title=Antares|url= http://www.astro.uiuc.edu/~kaler/sow/antares.html|accessdate=13 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its large size and relatively small mass give Antares a very low average density.

The size of Antares may be calculated using its parallax and angular diameter. The parallax angle is given in the box to the right, and the angular diameter is known from lunar occultation measurements (41.3 ¬± 0.1 mas).&lt;ref name=&quot;Astronomy and Astrophysics&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|author=A. Richichi|date=April 1990|title=A new accurate determination of the angular diameter of Antares|journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics|volume=230|issue=2|pages=355‚Äì362|bibcode= 1990A&amp;A...230..355R}}&lt;/ref&gt; This leads to a radius of 822 ¬± 80 [[solar radius|solar radii]].{{Clarify|date=March 2010|reason=source of +/- 80 is unclear, simple calculation using 1990 measurement of 43.1 mas and 1997 Hipparcos parallax of 5.4 +/- 1.68 mas gives a radius from 653 to 1246 solar radii, and not 822}}

Antares is a type ''LC'' [[slow irregular variable]] star, whose apparent magnitude slowly varies from +0.88 to +1.16.&lt;ref name=var&gt;{{Cite web| title=Query= alf Sco | url=http://www.sai.msu.su/gcvs/cgi-bin/search.cgi?search=alf+Sco | publisher=[[Centre de Donn√©es astronomiques de Strasbourg]] | work=[[General Catalogue of Variable Stars]] | accessdate=2010-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The best time to view Antares is on or around May 31 of each year, when the star is at [[opposition (astronomy and astrology)|opposition]] to the [[Sun]]. At this time, Antares rises at dusk and sets at dawn, and is thus in view all night. For approximately two to three weeks on either side of November 30, Antares is not visible at all, being lost in the Sun's glare; this period of invisibility is longer in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] than in the [[Southern Hemisphere]], since the star's [[declination]] is significantly south of the celestial equator.

===Companion star===
Antares has a hot blue [[companion star]], Antares B, of spectral type B2.5 at a separation of about 2.9 [[Arcminute#Astronomy|arcseconds]], or 550 [[Astronomical unit|AUs]] at Antares' estimated distance.&lt;ref name=&quot;kaler&quot; /&gt;  At magnitude 5.5, it is only 1/370th as bright visually as Antares A, although it shines with 170 times the Sun's luminosity. It is normally difficult to see in small telescopes due to Antares' glare, but can sometimes be seen in apertures over {{convert|150|mm|in|abbr=on|lk=off}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Brightest Stars: Discovering the Universe Through the Sky's Most Brilliant Stars |last=Schaaf|first=Fred |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2008 |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |isbn=9780471704102 |page=218 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=LvnNFyPAQyUC&amp;pg=PA218&amp;lpg=PA218 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The companion is often described as green, but this is probably a contrast effect.&lt;ref name=&quot;kaler&quot; /&gt;  Antares B can be observed with a small [[telescope]] for a few seconds during lunar [[occultation]]s while Antares itself is hidden by the [[Moon]]; it was discovered by [[Johann Tobias B√ºrg]] during one such occultation on April 13, 1819.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Burnham's Celestial Handbook |last=Burnham |first=Robert, Jr. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1978 |publisher=Dover Publications |location=New York |isbn= |page=1666 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The orbit is poorly known, with an estimated [[orbital period|period]] of 878 years.

===Position on the ecliptic===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Antares-sun.gif|thumb|left|200px|Antares near the Sun, event which occurs on December 2 every year. Image from SOHO.]] --&gt;
Antares is one of the 4 first magnitude stars that lies within 5¬∞ of the ecliptic and therefore can be [[Occultation|occulted]] by the Moon and rarely by the planets. On 31 July 2009, Antares was occulted by the moon.

Antares, the proper name of this star, derives from the [[Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|ŒÜŒΩœÑŒ¨œÅŒ∑œÇ}}, meaning &quot;(holds) against [[Ares]] (Mars)&quot;, due to the similarity of its [[red]]dish hue to the appearance of the planet [[Mars]].  It is the brightest star in the [[constellation]] [[Scorpius]]. However, it is also thought that Antares may have been named after the ancient Arab warrior-poet [[Antarah ibn Shaddad|Antar]].&lt;ref name=&quot;allen&quot;&gt;{{Cite book

Its distinctive color has made the star an object of interest to many societies throughout history.
* Many of the old [[Egypt]]ian temples are oriented so that the light of Antares plays a role in the ceremonies performed there.

* The Wotjobaluk [[Koori]] people of Victoria knew Antares as ''Djuit'', son of ''Marpean-kurrk'' ([[Arcturus]]); the stars on each side represented his wives. The Kulin Kooris saw Antares (''Balayang'') as the brother of ''Bunjil'' ([[Altair]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Mudrooroo|title=Aboriginal mythology : an A-Z spanning the history of aboriginal mythology from the earliest legends to the present day|publisher=HarperCollins|location=London|year=1994|page=5|isbn=1855383063}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aldebaran''' (Œ± Tau, Œ± Tauri, [[alpha (letter)|Alpha]] Tauri) is an [[orange giant]] [[star]] located about 65 [[light year]]s away in the [[zodiac]] [[constellation]] of [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus]]. With an average [[apparent magnitude]] of 0.87 it is the brightest star in the constellation and is [[list of brightest stars|one of the brightest stars]] in the nighttime sky. The name ''Aldebaran'' is [[Arabic language|Arabic]] ('''{{lang|ar|[[wikt:ÿßŸÑÿØÿ®ÿ±ÿßŸÜ|ÿßŸÑÿØÿ®ÿ±ÿßŸÜ]]}}''' ''{{transl|ar|al-dabarƒÅn}}'') and translates literally as &quot;''the follower''&quot;, presumably because this bright star appears to follow the [[Pleiades (star cluster)|Pleiades]], or &quot;Seven Sisters&quot; [[open star cluster|star cluster]] in the night sky.&lt;ref name=Kaler/&gt;

In 1997 a [[Substellar object|substellar]] companion was reported but subsequent observations have not confirmed this claim.

== Physical properties ==
[[File:Aldebaran-Sun comparison-en.svg|thumb|left|200px|Size comparison between Aldebaran and the Sun]]
Aldebaran is classified as a type K5III star. It is an [[orange giant]] star that has moved off the [[main sequence]] line of the [[Hertzsprung‚ÄìRussell diagram]]. It has exhausted the [[hydrogen]] fuel in its core and [[hydrogen fusion]] has ceased there. Although not yet hot enough for [[helium fusion|fusing helium]], the core temperature of the star has greatly increased due to gravitational pressure and the star has expanded to a diameter of 44.2 times the diameter of the [[Sun]],&lt;ref name=&quot;aldiam&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richichi &amp; Roccatagliata (2005) derived an angular diameter of 20.58¬±0.03 milliarcsec, which given a distance of 65 light years yields a diameter of 61 million km.&lt;/ref&gt; approximately 61 million [[kilometre]]s (see [[10 gigametres]] for similar sizes). The [[Hipparcos]] satellite has measured it as {{convert|65.1|ly|pc|abbr=off|lk=on}} away, and it shines with 150 times the Sun's luminosity.&lt;ref name=Kaler/&gt;

Aldebaran is a slightly [[variable star]], of the [[slow irregular variable]] type ''LB''. It varies by about 0.2 in apparent magnitude.&lt;ref name=var&gt;{{cite web | title=Query= alf Tau | url=http://www.sai.msu.su/gcvs/cgi-bin/search.cgi?search=alf+Tau | publisher=[[Centre de Donn√©es astronomiques de Strasbourg]] | work=[[General Catalogue of Variable Stars]] | accessdate=2009-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Visibility ==
Aldebaran is one of the easiest stars to find in the [[night sky]], partly due to its brightness and partly due to its spatial relation to one of the more noticeable [[asterism (astronomy)|asterisms]] in the sky. If one follows the three stars of [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]]'s belt from left to right (in the Northern Hemisphere) or right to left (in the Southern), the first bright star found by continuing that line is Aldebaran.

Aldebaran has the appearance of being the brightest member of the more scattered [[Hyades (star cluster)|Hyades]] [[open star cluster]] that makes up the bull's head shaped asterism. However, Aldebaran is merely located by chance in the line of sight between the Earth and the Hyades; the star cluster is actually more than twice as far away, at about 150 light years.

[[File:Occultation.jpg|thumb|left|200px|In this July, 1997, still frame captured from video, Aldebaran has just reappeared on the dark limb of the waning crescent Moon in this predawn occultation.]]
Aldebaran is close enough to the [[ecliptic]] to be [[Occultation|occulted]] by the [[Moon]]. Such occultations occur when the Moon's [[ascending node]] is near the [[autumnal equinox]]. This event will next occur around 2015. A reasonably accurate estimate for the diameter of Aldebaran was obtained during the September 22, 1978 occultation.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal

==Double star==
Five faint stars appear close enough to Aldebaran in its visual field for astronomers to consider it a [[double star]] association. These stars were given alphabetic secondary star designations more or less in the order of their discovery, with the letter A reserved for the primary star. The better known characteristics of these [[double star|optical double stars]] are listed in the table below with the primary star, Aldebaran (Alpha Tauri A), shown for reference.&lt;ref name=VizieR&gt;{{cite web |title=VizieR Detailed Page CCDM===04359+1631

Some surveys have indicated that Alpha Tauri B may have about the same [[proper motion]] and [[parallax]] as Aldebaran and thus may be a [[binary star|physical binary]] system. However these measurements are difficult to make because the dim B component appears so close to the bright primary star. The resulting margin of error is too large to positively establish (or exclude) a physical relationship between the two stars. So far neither the B component, nor anything else, has been unambiguously shown to be physically associated with Aldebaran.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | title=Statistical studies of visual double and multiple stars.

Alpha Tauri CD is a  [[binary star|binary system]] with the C and D component stars gravitationally bound to and co-orbiting each other. These co-orbiting stars have been shown to be located far beyond Aldebaran and are members of the Hyades star cluster. As with the rest of the stars in the cluster they do not physically interact with Aldebaran in any way.&lt;ref name=CD /&gt;

What features is this image meant to represent? Does anyone know what an 11mj planet would even look like? The planet is not even confirmed.--&gt;
In 1993, radial velocity measurements of Aldebaran, [[Arcturus]] and [[Pollux (star)|Pollux]] showed that Aldebaran exhibited a long-period radial velocity oscillation, which could be interpreted as a ''substellar companion''. The measurements for Aldebaran implied a companion with a minimum mass 11.4 times that of [[Jupiter]] in a 643-day orbit at a separation of {{convert|2.0|AU|Gm|abbr=on}} in a mildly [[Eccentricity (orbit)|eccentric]] orbit. However, all three stars surveyed showed similar oscillations yielding similar companion masses, and the authors concluded that the variation was likely to be intrinsic to the star rather than due to the gravitational effect of a companion.&lt;ref name=Kgiants&gt;{{cite journal|bibcode=1993ApJ...413..339H

==Etymology==

In [[Persia]] it was known as Sadvis and Kugard.&lt;ref&gt;Lughatnama-yi Dehkhuda, under Dabaran&lt;sup&gt;''[invalid reference]''&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] called it ''{{lang|la|Palilicium}}''.

In [[Chinese language|Chinese]] it is known as {{lang|zh|[[:zh:Áï¢ÂÆø‰∫î|Áï¢ÂÆø‰∫î]]}} (''{{lang|zh-Latn|B√¨xi√πw≈≠}}'', the Fifth Star of the Net).

in [[Hindu astronomy]] it is identified as the [[nakshatra|lunar mansion]] [[Rohini (nakshatra)|Rohini]] and as one of the twenty-seven daughters of [[Daksha]] and the wife of the god [[Chandra]].

==Myths==
This easily seen and striking star in its suggestive asterism is a popular subject for ancient and modern myths.

* Inuit culture: In [[Inuit astronomy]], Aldebaran is called &quot;Spirit of a [[Polar Bear]]&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

* Mexican culture: For the [[Seri people|Seris]] of northwestern Mexico, this star is providing light for the seven women giving birth ([[Pleiades (star cluster)|Pleiades]]).

* Native American culture: For the Dakotas (a branch of the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] [[Sioux]] tribe), Aldebaran took on a heroic aspect. The young star was the child of the sun and the lady Blue Star. One day, he desired to hunt the [[white buffalo]] (the [[Pleiades (star cluster)|Pleiades]]). After he pulled up a sapling to make a spear, a hole was made in the ground and he could see all the people of Earth down below. The white buffalo took this chance to push him through. He was found by an old woman and was to be known as Old Woman's Grandson. On Earth, he killed many strange monsters that had been troubling the Native Americans; one monster of which was a serpent that caused drought. The young hero killed the serpent, releasing a great stream of water that became the [[Mississippi River]]. In time, Old Woman's Grandson remembered the white buffalo and returned to hunting him in the sky to fulfill his destiny.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

* The Vril Society was founded as &quot;The All German Society for Metaphysics&quot; in 1921 to explore the origins of the Aryan race. It was formed by a group of female psychic mediums led by the Thule Gesellschaft medium Marija Or≈°iƒá (Maria Orshitsch) of Zagreb, who claimed to have received communication from Aryan aliens living on Alpha Tauri, in the Aldebaran system. Allegedly, these aliens had visited Earth and settled in Sumeria, and the word Vril was formed from the ancient Sumerian word &quot;Vri-Il&quot; (&quot;like god&quot;). A second medium was known only as Sigrun, a name etymologically related to Sigrune, a Valkyrie and one of Wotan's nine daughters in Norse legend.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

'''Altair''' ('''Alpha&amp;nbsp;Aquilae'''  / '''Alpha&amp;nbsp;Aql''' / '''Œ±&amp;nbsp;Aquilae''' / '''Œ±&amp;nbsp;Aql''' / '''Atair''') is the brightest [[star]] in the [[constellation]] [[Aquila (constellation)|Aquila]] and the [[list of brightest stars|twelfth brightest star]] in the night sky. It is an [[Stellar classification#Class A|A-type]] [[main sequence star]] with an apparent [[visual magnitude]] of 0.77 and is one of the vertices of the [[Summer Triangle]]; the other two are [[Deneb]] and [[Vega]].&lt;ref name=sb0 /&gt;&lt;ref name=darlingaltair /&gt;&lt;ref name=darlingsummer&gt;[http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/S/Summer_Triangle.html Summer Triangle], entry, ''The Internet Encyclopedia of Science'', David Darling.

==Star==
[[Image:Altair.jpg|Altair|thumb|left|230px]]

Altair is located 16.8 [[light-years]] (5.14 [[parsec]]s) from Earth and is one of the closest stars visible to the naked eye.&lt;ref&gt;p. 194, ''The Brightest Stars: Discovering The Universe Through The Sky's Most Brilliant Stars'', Fred Schaaf, Hoboken, New Jersey: John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 2008, ISBN 978-0-471-70410-2.&lt;/ref&gt; Along with [[Beta Aquilae]] and [[Gamma Aquilae]], it forms the well-known line of stars sometimes referred to as the ''Family of Aquila'' or ''Shaft of Aquila''.&lt;ref&gt;p. 190, Schaaf 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Altair is a [[Stellar classification#Class A|type-A]] [[main sequence star]] with approximately 1.8 times the [[mass]] of the Sun and 11 times its [[luminosity (astronomy)|luminosity]].&lt;ref name=monnier07 /&gt;&lt;ref name=peterson06 /&gt; Altair possesses an extremely rapid rate of rotation; it has a rotational period of approximately 9 hours.&lt;ref name=peterson06 /&gt; For comparison, the equator of the [[Sun]] requires just over 25 days for a complete rotation. This rapid rotation forces Altair to be [[oblate spheroid|oblate]]; its equatorial diameter is over 20 percent greater than its polar diameter.&lt;ref name=monnier07 /&gt;

Satellite measurements made in 1999 with the [[Wide-Field Infrared Explorer]] showed that the brightness of Altair fluctuates slightly, varying by less than a thousandth of a magnitude.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iop.org/EJ/article/0004-637X/619/2/1072/60499.text.html&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, it was identified in 2005 as a [[Œ¥ Scuti variable]] star. Its [[light curve]] can be approximated by adding together a number of [[sine wave]]s, with periods that range between 0.8 and 1.5 hours.&lt;ref&gt;Altair: The Brightest Œ¥ Scuti Star, D. L. Buzasi et al., ''The Astrophysical Journal'' '''619''', #2 (February 2005), pp. 1072‚Äì1076, {{doi|10.1086/426704}}, {{bibcode|2005ApJ...619.1072B}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oblateness and surface temperature===

The angular diameter of Altair was measured [[interferometrically]] by [[R. Hanbury Brown]] and his coworkers at [[Narrabri Stellar Intensity Interferometer|Narrabri Observatory]] in the 1960s.  They found a diameter of 3 [[milliarcseconds]].&lt;ref&gt;The stellar interferometer at Narrabri Observatory-II. The angular diameters of 15 stars, R. Hanbury Brown, J. Davis, L. R. Allen, and J. M. Rome, ''Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society'' '''137''' (1967), pp. 393‚Äì417, {{bibcode|1967MNRAS.137..393H}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Hanbury Brown et al. realized that Altair would be rotationally flattened, they had insufficient data to experimentally observe its oblateness.  Altair was later observed to be flattened by [[infrared]] interferometric measurements made by the [[Palomar Testbed Interferometer]] in 1999 and 2000. This work was published by [[Gerard van Belle|G. T. van Belle]] and his co-authors in 2001.&lt;ref name=pti2001 /&gt;

Theory predicts that, owing to Altair's rapid rotation, its [[surface gravity]] and [[effective temperature]] should be lower at the equator, making the equator less luminous than the poles.  This phenomenon, known as [[gravity darkening]] or the [[von Zeipel effect]], was confirmed for Altair by measurements made by the [[Navy Prototype Optical Interferometer]] in 2001, and analyzed by Ohishi et al. (2004) and Peterson et al. (2006).&lt;ref name=peterson06 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Asymmetric Surface Brightness Distribution of Altair Observed with the Navy Prototype Optical Interferometer, Naoko Ohishi, Tyler E. Nordgren, and Donald J. Hutter, ''The Astrophysical Journal'' '''612''', #1 (September 1, 2004), pp. 463‚Äì471, {{doi|10.1086/422422}}, {{bibcode|2004ApJ...612..463O}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, A. Domiciano de Souza et al. (2005) verified gravity darkening using the measurements made by the Palomar and Navy interferometers, together with new measurements made by the VINCI instrument at the [[VLTI]].&lt;ref&gt;Gravitational-darkening of Altair from interferometry, A. Domiciano de Souza, P. Kervella, S. Jankov, F. Vakili, N. Ohishi, T. E. Nordgren, and L.

Accessed on line November 25, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 and 2007, J. D. Monnier and his coworkers produced an image of Altair's surface from 2006 infrared observations made with the [[Michigan Infrared Combiner|MIRC]] instrument on the [[CHARA array]] interferometer; this was the first time the surface of any [[main-sequence star]], apart from the [[Sun]], had been imaged.&lt;ref name=nsf /&gt; The false-color image was published in 2007 and can be seen above and to the left; the brighter regions are shown in white and darker regions in blue. In this image, North (the direction towards the [[North Celestial Pole]]) is up and East is left, and the white line is the rotational axis of Altair. The black grid shows lines of latitude and longitude in an Altair-centric coordinate system. The [[von Zeipel theorem|von Zeipel effect]] can be observed in the image, which shows a white spot near the pole and a darker equator. The equatorial radius of the star was estimated to be 2.03 solar radii, and the polar radius 1.63 solar radii‚Äîa 25% increase of the stellar radius from pole to equator.&lt;ref name=monnier07 /&gt;

== Etymology, mythology, and culture ==
The name ''Altair'' has been used since medieval times.  It is an abbreviation of the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] phrase {{lang|ar|ÿßŸÑŸÜÿ≥ÿ± ÿßŸÑÿ∑ÿßÿ¶ÿ±}}, ''an-nasr a·π≠-·π≠ƒÅ‚Äôir'' ({{lang-en|The flying eagle}}).

The [[Koori]] people of Victoria also knew Altair as ''Bunjil'', the [[Wedge-tailed Eagle]], and Œ≤ and Œ≥ Aquilae are his two wives the [[Black Swan]]s.

The '''Australian Broadcasting Corporation''', commonly referred to as ''&quot;the ABC&quot;'' (and informally as &quot;Aunty&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;NewTeethForAunty&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=New Teeth for Aunty: Reinvigorating the National Broadcaster |url=http://www.themonthly.com.au/tm/node/749 |date=1 December 2007 | work = Monthly}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

With a total budget of A$1.13&amp;nbsp;billion annually,&lt;ref name=&quot;budgetreport&quot;&gt;Budget Paper No. 4 2009‚Äì2010, Retrieved 12 May 2009 &quot;http://www.budget.gov.au/2009-10/content/bp4/html/bp4_agency_resourcing_04_bcde.htm&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; the corporation provides television, radio, online and mobile services throughout metropolitan and regional Australia, as well as overseas through the [[Australia Network]] and [[Radio Australia]].

Founded in 1929 as the [[Australian Broadcasting Company]], it was subsequently made a state-owned corporation on 1 July 1932, as the Australian Broadcasting Commission. The ''Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983''&lt;ref name=&quot;abc-act83&quot; /&gt; changed the name of the organisation to the ''Australian Broadcasting Corporation'', effective 1 July 1983.&lt;ref name=&quot;abc-act83&quot; /&gt; Although funded and owned by the government, the ABC remains [[editorial independence|editorially independent]] as ensured through the ABC Act.&lt;ref name=&quot;abc-act83&quot; /&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation}}

===1920s‚Äì40s===
{{See also|Australian Broadcasting Company}}
The first public radio station in Australia opened in Sydney on 13 November 1923 under the call sign 2SB with other stations in Melbourne, [[Brisbane]], [[Adelaide]], [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] and [[Hobart]] following.&lt;ref name=&quot;abcradio100&quot;&gt;{{cite web

| accessdate = 3 October 2007
}}&lt;/ref&gt; A licensing scheme, administered by the [[Postmaster-General's Department]], was soon established allowing certain stations government funding, albeit with restrictions placed on their advertising content.&lt;ref name=&quot;langdon95&quot;&gt;{{cite web

| accessdate = 3 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a 1927 [[Royal Commission]] inquiry into radio licensing issues, the government established the National Broadcasting Service which subsequently took over a number of the larger funded stations. It also nationalised the [[Australian Broadcasting Company]] which had been created by entertainment interests to supply programs to various radio stations.&lt;ref name=&quot;langdon95&quot; /&gt; On 1 July 1932, the  Australian Broadcasting Commission was established, taking over the operations of the National Broadcasting Service and eventually establishing offices in each of Australia's capital cities.&lt;ref name=&quot;langdon95&quot; /&gt;
[[File:ABC Perth.jpg|250px|right|thumb|The ABC's [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] headquarters in 1937.]]
Over the next four years the stations were reformed into a cohesive broadcasting organisation through regular program relays, coordinated by a centralised bureaucracy.&lt;ref name=&quot;bcasthistory&quot;&gt;{{cite web
| title = Australian Broadcast History
| work = Barry Mishkid
| url = http://www.oldradio.com/archives/international/austral.html
| accessdate = 3 October 2007
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Australian broadcast radio spectrum was constituted of the ABC and the commercial sector.&lt;ref name=&quot;bcasthistory&quot; /&gt;

In 1942 ''The Australian Broadcasting Act'' was passed, giving the ABC the power to decide when, and in what circumstances, political speeches should be broadcast.&lt;ref name=&quot;abc-waryears&quot;&gt;{{cite web
| title = About the ABC ‚Äì The 40s ‚Äì The War Years

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Directions from the Minister about whether or not to broadcast any matter now had to be made in writing, and any exercise of the power had to be mentioned in the Commission's Annual Report.&lt;ref name=&quot;abc-waryears&quot; /&gt; It was used only once, in 1963.&lt;ref name=&quot;abc-waryears&quot; /&gt; In the same year, &quot;Kindergarten of the Air&quot; began on ABC Radio in Perth, and was later broadcast nationally.

===1950s‚Äì70s===
{{See also|ABC Television}}
The commission commenced television broadcasting in Sydney and Melbourne in 1956. [[ABN-2]] Sydney was inaugurated by the Prime Minister, [[Robert Menzies]], on 5 November with [[ABV-2]] Melbourne following two weeks later, on 18 November. These two stations were later joined by additional services in Brisbane ([[ABQ-2]]), Adelaide ([[ABS-2]]), Perth ([[ABW-2]]), Hobart ([[ABT-2]]) and, eventually, Darwin ([[ABD-6]]). [[James Dibble]] read the first television news bulletin for the ABC.&lt;ref&gt;Australian Broadcasting Corporation, [http://www.abc.net.au/corp/history/galpost9.htm &quot;About the ABC: History of the ABC: James Dibble&quot;]. Retrieved 3 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Jamesdibble.jpg|right|250px|thumb|[[James Dibble]] reading the first [[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]] bulletin in 1956.]]
Although radio programs could be broadcast nationally by [[landline]], television relay facilities were not put in place until the early 1960s.&lt;ref name=&quot;abc-50s&quot;&gt;{{cite web
| title = About the ABC ‚Äì The 50s ‚Äì The Postwar Years

| accessdate = 1 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; This meant that news bulletins had to be sent to each capital city by [[teleprinter]], to be prepared and presented separately in each city, with filmed materials copied manually and sent to each state.&lt;ref name=&quot;abc-50s&quot; /&gt; Other television programs at the time included the popular ''[[Six O'Clock Rock]]'' hosted by [[Johnny O'Keefe]], ''[[Mr Squiggle]]'', as well as operas and plays.&lt;ref name=&quot;abc-50s&quot; /&gt;

In 1975, colour television was introduced into Australia, and within a decade the ABC had moved into satellite broadcasting, greatly enhancing its ability to distribute content nationally. In the same year, the ABC introduced a 24-hour-a-day AM rock station in Sydney, 2JJ ([[Double Jay]]), which was eventually expanded into the national [[Triple J]] FM network.&lt;ref name=&quot;abc-60s70s&quot; /&gt; A year later, a national [[European classical music|classical music]] network was established on the [[frequency modulation|FM]] band, broadcasting from Adelaide. It was initially known as ABC-FM ‚Äì referring both to its 'fine music' programming and radio frequency.&lt;ref name=&quot;abc-60s70s&quot;&gt;{{cite web

In 1978 the ABC NSW Staff Association organised a strike against budget cuts and political interference. Sydney ABC was off air for four days.&lt;ref&gt;Molomby, Tom, ''Is there a moderate on the roof? ABC Years'', William Heinemann Australia, Port Melbourne, 1991, p.110&lt;/ref&gt; A packed free concert in support was held at the [[Regent Theatre (Sydney)|Regent Theatre]] and compered by [[Bob Hudson (Australian singer)|Bob Hudson]]. It featured [[Fred Dagg]] and [[Robyn Archer]].&lt;ref&gt;Molomby, Tom, ''Is there a moderate on the roof? ABC Years'', William Heinemann Australia, Port Melbourne, 1991, p.114&lt;/ref&gt;

The ABC budget began to decline in 1976 and was not reversed until 1985. However, Tom Molomby writes:
:&quot;The effects of the budget reductions had been so badly handled that the organisation was to remain seriously crippled for years.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Molomby, Tom, ''Is there a moderate on the roof? ABC Years'', William Heinemann Australia, Port Melbourne, 1991, p.160&lt;/ref&gt;

===1980s‚Äì90s===
The ''Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983''&lt;ref name = &quot;abc-act83&quot;/&gt; changed the name of the organisation from the &quot;Australian Broadcasting Commission&quot; to the &quot;Australian Broadcasting Corporation&quot; effective 1 July 1983.&lt;ref name=&quot;abc-act83&quot; /&gt; At the same time, the newly-formed Corporation underwent significant restructuring ‚Äì program production in [[Indigenous Australians|indigenous]] affairs, comedy, social history and current affairs was significantly expanded, while the Corporation's output of drama was boosted.&lt;ref name=&quot;abc-80s&quot; /&gt; Local production trebled from 1986‚Äì91 with the assistance of co-production, co-financing, and pre-sales arrangements.&lt;ref name=&quot;abc-80s&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = About the ABC ‚Äì The 80s
| publisher = Australian Broadcasting Corporation
| url = http://abc.net.au/corp/history/hist6.htm
| accessdate = 1 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The changes also led to the split of television and radio operations into two separate divisions, with an overhaul of management, finance, property and engineering undertaken.&lt;ref name=&quot;abc-80s&quot; /&gt; [[Geoffrey Whitehead]] was the initial Managing Director, however following his resignation in 1986, [[David Hill]] (at the time chair of the ABC Board) took over his position.

A new Concert Music department was formed in 1985 to coordinate the corporation's six symphony orchestras, which in turn received a greater level of autonomy in order to better respond to local needs.&lt;ref name=&quot;abc-80s&quot; /&gt; Open-air free concerts and tours, educational activities, and joint ventures with other music groups were undertaken at the time to expand the Orchestras' audience reach.&lt;ref name=&quot;abc-80s&quot; /&gt;

ABC Radio was restructured significantly in 1985 ‚Äì Radio One became the Metropolitan network, while Radio 2 became known as [[Radio National]] (callsigns, however, were not standardised until 1990). New programs such as ''The World Today'', ''Australia All Over'', and ''The Coodabeen Champions'' were introduced, while [[ABC Classic FM|ABC-FM]] established an Australian Music Unit in 1989.&lt;ref name=&quot;abc-80s&quot; /&gt; [[Radio Australia]] began to focus on the [[Asia-Pacific]] region, with coverage targeted at the south west and central Pacific, south-east Asia, and north Asia. Radio Australia also carried more news coverage, with special broadcasts during the [[1987 Fijian coups d'√©tat|1987 Fijian coup]], [[Tiananmen Square massacre]], and the [[First Gulf War]].&lt;ref name=&quot;abc-80s&quot; /&gt;

[[File:ABC Sydney.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The ABC's Sydney headquarters in [[Ultimo, New South Wales|Ultimo]].]]

In 1991, the Corporation's Sydney radio and orchestral operations moved to a new building built by [[Leighton Holdings]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The ABC Multimedia Unit was established in July, 1995, to manage the new ABC website (launched in August). Funding was allocated later that year specifically for online content, as opposed to reliance on funding for television and radio content. The first online election coverage was put together in 1996, and included news, electorate maps, candidate information and live results.&lt;ref name=&quot;abc-90s&quot; /&gt;

By the early 1990s, all major ABC broadcasting outlets moved to 24 hour-a-day operation, while regional radio coverage in Australia was extended with 80 new transmitters.&lt;ref name=&quot;abc-90s&quot; /&gt; Live television broadcasts of selected parliamentary sessions started in 1990.&lt;ref name=&quot;abc-90s&quot; /&gt; [[ABC NewsRadio]], a continuous news network broadcast on the [[Parliamentary and News Network]] when parliament is not sitting, was launched on 5 October 1994.&lt;ref name=&quot;abc-90s&quot; /&gt;

International television service [[Australia Television International]] was established in 1993, while at the same Radio Australia increased its international reach.&lt;ref name=&quot;abc-90s&quot; /&gt; Reducing funding in 1997 for Radio Australia resulted in staff and programming cuts.&lt;ref name=&quot;abc-90s&quot; /&gt;

''Australia Television'' was sold to the [[Seven Network]] in 1998, however the service continued to show [[ABC News and Current Affairs|ABC news and current affairs programming]] up until its closure in 2001.&lt;ref name=&quot;mr&quot;&gt;{{cite web

===2000s===
In 2001, digital television commenced after four years of preparation.&lt;ref name=&quot;abc-00s&quot; /&gt; In readiness, the ABC had fully digitised its production, post-production and transmission facilities ‚Äì heralded at the time as 'the greatest advance in television technology since the introduction of colour.'&lt;ref name=&quot;abc-00s&quot; /&gt; The first programs to be produced in widescreen were drama series ''[[Something in the Air (TV series)|Something in the Air]]'', ''[[Grass Roots (TV series)|Grass Roots]]'' and ''In the Mind of the Architect''.

At the same time, the ABC's Multimedia division was renamed 'ABC New Media', becoming an output division of the ABC alongside Television and Radio.&lt;ref name=&quot;abc-00s&quot; /&gt; Legislation allowed the ABC to provide 'multichannels' ‚Äì additional, digital-only, television services managed by the New Media division. Soon after the introduction of digital television in 2001, [[Fly TV]] and the [[ABC Kids Channel]] launched, showing a mix of programming aimed at teenagers and children.

In 2002, the ABC launched [[Australia Network|ABC Asia Pacific]] ‚Äì the replacement for the defunct Australia Television International operated previously by the Seven Network. Much like its predecessor, and companion radio network [[Radio Australia]], the service provided a mix of programming targeted at audiences throughout the Asia-Pacific region. Funding cuts in 2003 led to the closure of Fly and the ABC Kid's Channel.

The ABC also launched a digital radio service, [[ABC DiG]], in November 2002, available though the internet and digital television, but not available through any other terrestrial broadcast until [[DAB+]] became available in 2009.

[[File:Abc2promo.jpg|250px|right|thumb|[[ABC2]] launched on 7 March 2005]]

[[ABC2]], a second attempt at a digital-only television channel, launched on 7 March 2005. Unlike its predecessors the new service was not dependent on government funding, instead running on a budget of A$3&amp;nbsp;million per year.&lt;ref name=&quot;whoseabc&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Inglis |first=Kenneth Stanley |title=Whose ABC?

In the 2006‚Äì07 [[Federal Budget (Australia)|federal budget]], the ABC received [[Australian dollar|A$]]823&amp;nbsp;million of government funding,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = ABC Budget 2006‚Äì2007 | url = http://www.abc.net.au/corp/pubs/documents/budget2006-07.pdf | author = Australian Broadcasting Corporation | format = PDF | accessdate = 18 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; increased to $840&amp;nbsp;million in 2008‚Äì09.&lt;ref name=&quot;budgetreport&quot; /&gt;

Until 1948, the ABC was funded directly by radio licence fees; amendments were also made to the ''Australian Broadcasting Act'' that meant the ABC would receive its funding directly from the federal government. Licence fees remained until 1973 when they were abolished by the [[Gough Whitlam|Whitlam]] Labor government, on the basis that the near-universality of television and radio services meant that public funding was a fairer method of providing revenue for government-owned radio and television broadcasters.&lt;ref name=&quot;whoseabc&quot; /&gt;
