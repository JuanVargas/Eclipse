* [[United States]]
Drivers under 21 (the most common US legal drinking age), however, are held to stricter standards under [[zero tolerance]] laws. Adopted in varying forms in all states, these laws hold the driver to much lower blood alcohol content levels for criminal and/or license suspension purposes, commonly 0.01% to 0.05%. Many states have statutory regulations regarding driving while &quot;under the influence&quot; of an intoxicant and a different law for driving beyond the legal blood alcohol concentration.
A large number of laws apply from Federal regulatory bodies, states, counties, and cities. For further information on U.S. laws restrictions on alcohol sales, see [[Alcohol laws of the United States by state]]. Federal Aviation Administration: 0.01% for operators of common carriers, such as buses, for pilots 0.019% to fly, .039 without loss of medical (no fly until .019 or below), .04 permanent revocation of license for pilots, no alcohol within 8 hours per Federal Aviation Regulations&lt;ref&gt;[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/casecode/uscodes/18/parts/i/chapters/17a/sections/section_343.html FindLaw for Legal Professionals - Case Law, Federal and State Resources, Forms, and Code&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration: 0.04% for drivers driving a commercial vehicle which requires a [[Commercial Driver's License]] otherwise 0.08%.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/registration-licensing/cdl/cdl.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

* Blood alcohol content measures and proxies (such as breath PPM and blood alcohol content measured as mass/volume) are commonly coded into the law to provide prima-facie cases (much like speed limits). A driver measured to be over the allowed blood alcohol content limit has automatic penalties. But even below those levels, drivers can have civil liability and other criminal guilt. For example, in some state statutes (for example [[Arizona|AZ]]), any driving impairment to any degree caused by alcohol consumption can be a civil or criminal offense in addition to other offenses at higher blood alcohol content levels.

===Limits by country (BrAC: Breath Alcohol Content) ===
In certain countries, alcohol limits are determined by the Breath Alcohol Content (BrAC), not to be confused with blood alcohol content (BAC).

*In [[Greece]], the BrAC limit is 25 microgrammes of alcohol per 100 millilitres of breath. The limit in blood is 0.50 g/l.
** BrAC 25–40 = [[euro|€]]200 fine
** BrAC 40–60 = €700 fine, plus suspension of driving license for 90 days(introduced in 2007,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sefeaa.gr/downloads/2009/KOK.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;)
** BrAC &gt;60 = 2 months imprisonment, plus suspension of driving license for 180 days, plus €1,200 fine
*In [[Hong Kong]], the BrAC limit is 220 microgrammes per litre of breath (as well as other defined limits)
*In [[Netherlands|The Netherlands]] and [[Finland]], the BrAC limit is 220 microgrammes of alcohol per litre of breath (μg/l, colloquially known as &quot;Ugl&quot;).
*In [[Singapore]], the BrAC limit is 350 microgrammes of alcohol per litre of breath.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt;
*In [[Spain]] the BrAC limit is 250 microgrammes of alcohol per litre of breath and 150 microgrammes per litre of breath for drivers in their first two years after gaining a driving licence and common carriers.
*In the [[United Kingdom]] the BrAC limit is 350 microgrammes of alcohol per litre of breath (as well as the above defined blood alcohol content).

===Other limitation schemes===
*For [[South Korea]], the penalties for different blood alcohol content levels include
**0.01–0.049 = No Penalty
**0.05–0.09 = 100 days license suspension
**&gt;0.10 = Cancellation of car license.
**

==Test assumptions==
{{Refimprove|date=July 2007}}
Blood alcohol tests assume the individual being tested is average in various ways. For example, on average the ratio of blood alcohol content to breath alcohol content (the ''partition ratio'') is 2100 to 1. In other words, there are 2100 parts of alcohol in the blood for every part in the breath. However, the actual ratio in any given individual can vary from 1300:1 to 3100:1, or even more widely. This ratio varies not only from person to person, but within one person from moment to moment. Thus a person with a true blood alcohol level of .08 but a partition ratio of 1700:1 at the time of testing would have a .10 reading on a Breathalyzer calibrated for the average 2100:1 ratio.

A similar assumption is made in [[urinalysis]]. When urine is analyzed for alcohol, the assumption is that there are 1.3 parts of alcohol in the urine for every 1 part in the blood, even though the actual ratio can vary greatly.

Breath alcohol testing further assumes that the test is ''post-absorptive''—that is, that the absorption of alcohol in the subject's body is complete. If the subject is still actively absorbing alcohol, their body has not reached a state of ''equilibrium'' where the concentration of alcohol is uniform throughout the body. Most forensic alcohol experts reject test results during this period as the amounts of alcohol in the breath will not accurately reflect a true concentration in the blood.

==Metabolism and excretion==

{{Refimprove|date=May 2007}}

Alcohol is removed from the bloodstream by a combination of [[metabolism]], excretion, and evaporation. The relative proportion disposed of in each way varies from person to person, but typically about 95% is metabolised by the liver. The remainder of the alcohol is eliminated through excretion in breath, urine, sweat, feces, milk and saliva.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.intox.com/t-Physiology.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; Excretion into urine typically begins after about 40 minutes, whereas metabolisation commences as soon as the alcohol is absorbed, and even before alcohol levels have risen in the brain.

Alcohol is metabolised mainly by the group of six [[enzyme]]s collectively called [[alcohol dehydrogenase]]. These convert the ethanol into [[acetaldehyde]] (an intermediate that is actually more toxic than ethanol). The enzyme [[acetaldehyde dehydrogenase]] then converts the acetaldehyde into non-toxic Acetic acid.

Many physiologically active materials are removed from the bloodstream (whether by [[metabolism]] or excretion) at a rate proportional to the current concentration, so that they exhibit [[exponential decay]] with a characteristic [[halflife#Half-life in pharmacology and medicine|halflife]] (see [[pharmacokinetics]]). This is not true for alcohol, however. Typical doses of alcohol actually saturate the enzymes' capacity, so that alcohol is removed from the bloodstream at an approximately constant rate. This rate varies considerably between individuals; Another gender based difference is in the elimination of alcohol. Persons below the age of 25{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}, women &lt;ref&gt;http://www.alcohol.org.nz/BodyEffect.aspx?PostingID=676&lt;/ref&gt; persons of certain ethnicities, and persons with liver disease may process alcohol more slowly. Many [[East Asia]]ns (for example, about half of [[Japanese people|Japanese]]) have impaired [[acetaldehyde dehydrogenase]]; this causes acetaldehyde levels to peak higher, producing more severe [[hangover]]s and other effects such as flushing and tachycardia. Conversely, members of certain ethnicities that traditionally did not brew alcoholic beverages have lower levels of alcohol dehydrogenases and thus &quot;sober up&quot; very slowly, but reach lower aldehyde concentrations and have milder [[hangover]]s. Rate of detoxification of alcohol can also be slowed by certain drugs which interfere with the action of alcohol dehydrogenases, notably [[aspirin]], [[furfural]] (which may be found in [[fusel oil]]), fumes of [[trichloroethylene|certain solvents]], many [[heavy metals]], and some [[pyrazole]] compounds. Also suspected of having this effect are [[cimetidine]] ([[Tagamet]]), [[ranitidine]] ([[Zantac]]), and [[acetaminophen]] ([[Tylenol]]) ([[paracetamol]]).

Currently, the only known substance that can increase the rate of metabolism of alcohol is [[fructose]]. The effect can vary significantly from person to person, but a 100g dose of fructose has been shown to increase alcohol metabolism by an average of 80%.&lt;ref&gt;http://alcalc.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/26/1/53&lt;/ref&gt;

Alcohol absorption can be slowed by ingesting alcohol on a full stomach. Spreading the total absorption of alcohol over a greater period of time decreases the maximum alcohol level, decreasing the [[hangover]] effect. Thus, drinking on a full stomach or drinking while ingesting drugs which slow the breakdown of ethanol into acetaldehyde, will reduce the maximum blood levels of this substance, and decrease the hangover. Alcohol in non-carbonated beverages is absorbed more slowly than alcohol in carbonated drinks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.jflm.2006.12.010 | issn = 1752-928X | volume = 14 | issue = 7 | pages = 398–405 | last = Roberts | first = C. | coauthors = S.P.

===Retrograde extrapolation===
Retrograde [[extrapolation]] is the mathematical process by which someone's blood alcohol concentration at the time of driving is estimated by projecting backwards from a later chemical test. This involves estimating the absorption and elimination of alcohol in the interim between driving and testing. The rate of elimination in the average person is commonly estimated at .015 to .020&amp;nbsp;grams per deciliter per hour (g/dl/h){{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}, although again this can vary from person to person and in a given person from one moment to another. Metabolism can be affected by numerous factors, including such things as body temperature, the type of alcoholic beverage consumed, and the amount and type of food consumed.

In an increasing number of states, laws have been enacted to facilitate this speculative task: the blood alcohol content at the time of driving is legally presumed to be the same as when later tested. There are usually time limits put on this presumption, commonly two or three hours, and the defendant is permitted to offer evidence to rebut this presumption.

Forward extrapolation can also be attempted. If the amount of alcohol consumed is known, along with such variables as the weight and sex of the subject and period and rate of consumption, the blood alcohol level can be estimated by extrapolating forward. Although subject to the same infirmities as retrograde extrapolation—guessing based upon averages and unknown variables—this can be relevant in estimating BAC when driving and/or corroborating or contradicting the results of a later chemical test.

==Blood alcohol content calculation==
Blood alcohol content can be roughly estimated using a mathematical approach. Mathematical estimations can be useful for calculating a blood alcohol content level that is not currently testable, or a level that may be present in the future. While there are several ways to calculate it, one of the most effective ways is to simply measure the total amount of alcohol consumed divided by the total amount of water in the body—effectively giving the percent alcohol per volume water in the blood.

Gender plays an important role in the total amount of water that a person has. In general, men have a higher percent of water (58%) than women (49%). This fact alone strongly contributes to the generalization that men require more alcohol than women to achieve the same blood alcohol content level. Additionally, men are, on average, heavier than women. The more water a person has, the more alcohol is required to achieve the same alcohol:blood ratio, or blood alcohol content level. Further, studies have shown that women's alcohol metabolism varies from that of men due to such biochemical factors as different levels of [[alcohol dehydrogenase]] (the enzyme which breaks down alcohol) and the effects of oral contraceptives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oregoncounseling.org/ArticlesPapers/Documents/ETOHBIOFx.htm Biological Effects of Alcohol Use, Michaele Dunlap, Psy.D&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not strictly accurate to say that the water content of a person alone is responsible for the dissolution of alcohol within the body, because alcohol does dissolve in fatty tissue as well. When it does, a certain amount of alcohol is temporarily taken out of the blood and briefly stored in the fat. For this reason, most calculations of alcohol to body mass simply use the weight of the individual, and not specifically his water content.

== Cases of high blood alcohol levels==
{{Globalize/USA|date=March 2011}}
In November 2007, a driver was found passed out in her car in Oregon in the United States. A blood test showed her blood alcohol level was 0.550%. She was charged with several offenses, including two counts of driving under the influence of an intoxicant, reckless endangerment of a person, criminal mischief and driving with a suspended license. Her bail was later set at USD 50,000 since she had several previous convictions for similar offenses.&lt;ref name=extremedrunk/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=4061172 DUI Suspect's 'Lethal Dose' Earns $50K Bail] by David Schoetz, ABC News, December 28, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kptv.com/news/14935069/detail.html Deputies: Woman Had 0.55% Blood Alcohol Level], KPTV News, December 27, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2007, a driver was arrested in Klamath County, Oregon after she was found unconscious in her car which was stuck in a snow bank with its engine running. Police were forced to break a car window to remove her. After realizing she was in alcohol induced-coma, they rushed her to the hospital where a blood test showed her blood alcohol level was 0.720%. She reportedly was released from the hospital the next day.&lt;ref name=extremedrunk/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/years/2008/0110084dui1.html Drunkest Driver Ever?], The Smoking Gun, January 10, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; She was subsequently charged with drunk driving.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,321747,00.html Oregon Woman's Blood Alcohol Level Nine Times Legal Limit], Associated Press (reprinted by Fox News), January 10, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2008, a driver was arrested after he ran into a highway message board on Interstate 95 in [[Providence, Rhode Island]]. A breath test showed his blood alcohol level was at 0.491% and he was raced to the hospital where he was sedated and placed in a detoxification unit. He was subsequently charged with driving while intoxicated and resisting arrest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,389223,00.html R.I.

In December 2009, a [[South Dakota]] woman was found behind the wheel of a stolen car with a measured blood alcohol content of .708%, almost nine times the state's limit of .08%, thus becoming the highest recorded level of alcohol toxicity for the state. After she was hospitalized, she was released on bond and subsequently found in another stolen automobile while under the influence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rapidcityjournal.com/news/article_9d4a1d0e-f4d1-11de-8edf-001cc4c002e0.html], Rapid City Journal, December 29, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Highest recorded blood alcohol level/content===

In 1995, a man in [[Wrocław]], [[Poland]] had a car accident. At the hospital, his BAC was determined to be 1.48%. He died a few days later from wounds from a car accident. Police were baffled as to how an individual could attain such a high blood alcohol. Later, police discussions with his brother in-law Francois Hughes revealed that he had &quot;[[beer bong]]ed&quot; pure grain alcohol allegedly stolen from his place of work, a chemical plant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wprost.pl/ar/9999/Rekord-w-promilach/?I=963], Wprost (polish)&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2004, a man was admitted to the hospital in [[Plovdiv]], [[Bulgaria]] after being struck by a car. After detecting a strong alcohol odor, doctors at a hospital conducted a breath test which displayed the man's blood alcohol content at 0.914. Concerned that their equipment was malfunctioning, doctors also performed five separate lab tests, all of which confirmed the man's blood alcohol content.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2005/01/04/drunk-bulgarian-050104.html Bulgarian's blood-alcohol level astounds doctors], CBC News, January 4, 2005 (retrieved on March 16, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; The man was treated for serious injuries sustained in the crash and survived.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.novinite.com/view_news.php?id=43228 Bulgarian Sets World Record for Highest Blood Alcohol Level], Sofia News Agency (Novinte.com), January 4, 2005 (retrieved on March 31, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2005, French [[Gendarmerie|gendarmes]] from [[Bourg-en-Bresse]], [[France]] conducted a breath test on a man who had lost control of his car. He had an alcohol content of 0.976.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lci.tf1.fr/france/2005-02/volant-record-controle-absolu-4859363.html Absolute record for a breath test (fr)]&lt;/ref&gt; He was not injured in the accident but was charged with a € 150 fine and his driving license was canceled.

There have been reported cases of blood alcohol content higher than 1.00. In March 2009, a 45-year-old man was admitted to the hospital in Skierniewice, Poland after being struck by a car. The blood test showed blood alcohol content at 1.23. The man survived but did not remember either the accident or the circumstances of his alcohol consumption.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Drunkest Drinking Driver in Sweden: Blood Alcohol Concentration 0.545 W/v&quot;, an article by A.

In 1982, a 24 year old woman was admitted to the UCLA emergency room with a serum alcohol concentration of 1.5 (1510&amp;nbsp;mg/dL). She was alert and oriented to person and place (Reported in the Lancet, Dec 18 1982, pg 1394).

A '''barrister''' is a member of one of the two classes of [[lawyer]] found in many [[common law]] [[jurisdiction (area)|jurisdiction]]s with split legal professions. Barristers specialise in courtroom advocacy, drafting legal [[pleading]]s and giving expert legal opinions. They can be contrasted with [[solicitor]]s — the other class of lawyer in split professions — who have more direct access with clients and who are in general office based. Barristers are rarely hired by clients directly but instead are retained (or instructed) by solicitors to act on behalf of clients.

The historical difference between the two professions—and the only essential difference in [[England and Wales]] today—is that a solicitor is an [[Attorney at law|attorney]], which means they can act in the place of their client for legal purposes (as in signing contracts) and may conduct [[Lawsuit|litigation]] on their behalf by making applications to the court, writing letters in litigation to the client's opponent and so on. A barrister is not an attorney and is usually forbidden, either by law or professional rules or both, from &quot;conducting&quot; litigation. This means that while the barrister speaks on the client's behalf in court, he or she can only do so when instructed by a solicitor or certain other qualified professional clients, such as patent agents. 

Many countries with common law legal systems, such as the [[United States]], do not observe a distinction between barristers and solicitors. In countries with [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] or other kinds of legal systems the legal profession is often separated into divisions but these divisions rarely shadow those of barristers and solicitors.

==Differences between barristers and solicitors==
===Differences===
[[Image:Advokat, Engelsk advokatdräkt, Nordisk familjebok.png|200px|thumb|An artist's rendition of an early 20th century English barrister]] 
Essentially, barristers are the lawyers who represent litigants as their [[advocate]] before the courts of that [[jurisdiction]]. They speak in court and present the case before a judge or jury. In contrast, solicitors generally engage in preparatory work and advice, such as drafting and reviewing legal documents, dealing with and receiving instructions from the client, preparing evidence, and managing the day-to-day administration of a matter.

Other differences include the following:
*A barrister will usually have rights of audience in the higher courts, whereas other legal professionals will often have more limited access, or will need to take additional qualifications to do so. In this regard, the profession of barrister corresponds to that part of the role of legal professionals found in [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions relating to appearing in [[trial]]s or pleading cases before the courts.
*Barristers usually have a more specialised knowledge of case law and precedent. When a solicitor in general practice is confronted with an unusual point of law, they sometimes seek the &quot;opinion of counsel&quot; on the issue.&lt;ref&gt;In [[insurance]] [[contract]]s there is often the requirement to seek the expert opinion of counsel where the policy contains what is known as &quot;a [[QC clause]]&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;
*In most countries, barristers operate as sole practitioners, and are prohibited from forming [[partnership]]s or working as a barrister as part of a corporation (although in [[English law|England and Wales]] the Clementi report&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legal-services-review.org.uk/content/report/index.htm Clementi report]&lt;/ref&gt; has recommended the abolition of this restriction). However, barristers normally band together into 'chambers' to share clerks (administrators) and operating expenses. Some chambers grow to be large and sophisticated, and have a distinctly corporate feel. In some jurisdictions, some barristers are employed by firms of solicitors, banks or corporations as in-house legal advisers.
*Solicitors work directly with the client and are responsible for engaging an appropriate barrister; whereas barristers generally have little or no direct contact with their 'lay clients', particularly without the presence or involvement of the solicitor. All correspondence, inquiries, invoices, and so on, will be addressed to the solicitor, who is primarily responsible for the barrister's fees.
*In court, barristers are often visibly distinguished from solicitors by their apparel. For example, in Ireland, England and Wales, barristers usually wear a horsehair wig, stiff collar, bands and a gown. As of January 2008 Solicitor advocates will also be entitled to wear a wig, but will wear a different gown.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lawreports.co.uk/WLRD/2008/OTH/jan0.1.htm Practice Direction]&lt;/ref&gt;

In many countries the traditional divisions between barristers and solicitors are breaking down. Barristers once enjoyed a monopoly on appearances before the higher courts, but in England, Wales and Scotland this has now been abolished, and [[solicitor advocate]]s can generally appear for clients at trial. Increasingly, [[law firm|firms of solicitors]] are keeping even the most advanced advisory and litigation work in-house for economic and client relationship reasons. Similarly, the prohibition on barristers taking instructions directly from the public has also been widely abolished, but in practice, direct instruction is still a rarity in most jurisdictions, partly because barristers with narrow specialisations or who are only really trained for advocacy are not equipped to provide general advice to members of the public.

Historically barristers have had a major role in trial preparation, including drafting [[pleading]]s and reviewing evidence. In some areas of law, that is still the case. In others, it is relatively common for a barrister to only receive a &quot;brief&quot; from an instructing solicitor to represent a client at trial a day or two before the hearing.&lt;ref&gt;Part of this is cost.  Barristers are entitled to a 'brief fee' when a brief is delivered, and this represents the bulk of their fee in relation to any trial.  They are then usually entitled to a 'refresher' for each day of the trial after the first.  As many trials settle in the last few days before the hearing, many solicitors seek to save costs by delaying delivery of the brief until the last possible moment.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Justification for a split profession===
The reasons for a split profession are largely historical, but a number of reasons are still advanced for maintaining the split:
*Having an independent barrister reviewing a cause of action gives the client a fresh and independent opinion from an expert in the field, something that rarely happens in jurisdictions with fused professions.
*In many jurisdictions, judges are appointed from the bar; and because barristers are independent, this results in a more independent judiciary.
*Having recourse to all of the specialist barristers at the bar enables smaller firms, who could not maintain large specialist departments, to compete with larger firms.
*A barrister acts as a check on the solicitor conducting the trial; if it becomes apparent that the claim or defence has not been properly conducted by the solicitor prior to trial, the barrister can (and usually has a duty to) advise the client of a separate possible claim against the solicitor.
*Having trials conducted by experienced specialist advocates makes for smoother, more professionally run trials.

Against the above, a number of disadvantages are put forward:
*A multiplicity of legal advisers leads to higher costs (something that caused no small amount of concern to Sir [[David Clementi]] in his review of the English legal profession).
*As barristers are dependent upon solicitors for referrals of work, it is open to question how willing barristers are to criticise those who instruct them to the client.
*Barristers are sometimes criticised for being &quot;over-specialised&quot; and not having sufficient general expertise outside of what can be highly specialised fields.

A detailed examination of the justifications for a split legal profession and of the arguments in favour of a fused profession can be found in English solicitor Peter Reeve’s 1986 book, '''''Are Two Legal Professions Necessary?'''''&lt;ref&gt;London: Waterlow Publishers Limited, 1986 (foreword by Sir David Napley)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Regulation ==
Barristers are regulated by the [[Bar association|Bar]] for the jurisdiction where they practise, and in some countries, by the [[Inns of Court|Inn of Court]] to which they belong. In some countries, there is external regulation.

Inns of Court, where they exist, regulate admission to the profession. Inns of Court are independent societies that are titularly responsible for the training, admission (calling), and discipline of barristers. Where they exist, a person may only be called to the Bar by an Inn, of which they must first be a member. In fact, historically, call to and success at the Bar, to a large degree, depended upon social connections made early in life.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Duman, ''The English and Colonial Bars in the 19th Century'' (Routledge: London, 1983) ISBN 0856644684, 9780856644689&lt;/ref&gt;

A Bar collectively describes all members of the profession of barrister within a given jurisdiction. While as a minimum the Bar is an association embracing all its members, it is usually the case, either ''de facto'' or ''de jure'', that the Bar is invested with regulatory powers over the manner in which barristers practice.

==Barristers around the world==
In the common law tradition, the respective roles of a lawyer&amp;mdash;that is as legal adviser and advocate&amp;mdash;were formally split into two separate, regulated sub-professions, the other being the office of [[solicitor]]. Historically, the distinction was absolute, but in the modern legal age, some countries that had a split legal profession now have a [[fused profession]]&amp;mdash;anyone entitled to practice as a barrister may also practice as a solicitor, and vice versa. In practice, the distinction may be non-existent, minor, or marked, depending on the jurisdiction. In some jurisdictions, such Australia, Scotland and Ireland, there is little overlap.

=== Australia ===
In the [[Australia|Australian]] states of [[New South Wales]] and [[Queensland]] there is a split profession. Nevertheless, subject to conditions, barristers can accept direct access work from clients. Each state Bar Association regulates the profession and essentially has the functions of the English Inns of Court. In the states of [[South Australia]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and [[Western Australia]], as well as the [[Australian Capital Territory]], the professions of barrister and solicitor are fused, but nonetheless an independent bar exists, regulated by the Legal Practice Board of the state or territory. In the state of [[Tasmania]] the profession is fused, although a very small number of practitioners operate as an independent bar.

Generally counsel dress in the traditional English manner (wig, gown and [[jabot (neckwear)|jabot]]) before superior courts, although they no longer robe for appearances in lower jurisdictions. Wigs are no longer worn in the highest civil court in New South Wales, the Court of Appeal. Wigs are still worn in the Supreme Court, while only robes without wigs are worn in the District Courts in civil matters. Robes and wigs are worn in all criminal cases.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nswbar.asn.au/docs/professional/attire_state.php&lt;/ref&gt;

Each year the Bar Association appoints certain barristers of seniority and eminence to the rank of &quot;Senior Counsel&quot; (in New South Wales) or &quot;Queen's Counsel&quot; (in the Northern Territory). Such barristers carry the title &quot;SC&quot; or &quot;QC&quot; after their name. The appointments are made after a process of consultation with members of the profession and the judiciary. Senior Counsel appear in particularly complex or difficult cases. They make up about 14 per cent of the bar in New South Wales.

=== Canada ===
In [[Canada]] (except [[Quebec]]), the professions of barrister and solicitor are fused, and many lawyers refer to themselves with both names, even if they do not practice in both areas. In colloquial parlance within the Canadian legal profession, lawyers often term themselves as &quot;litigators&quot; (or &quot;barristers&quot;), or as &quot;solicitors&quot;, depending on the nature of their law practice though some may in effect practice as both litigators and solicitors. However, &quot;litigators&quot; would generally perform all litigation functions traditionally performed by barristers and solicitors; in contrast, those terming themselves &quot;solicitors&quot; would generally limit themselves to legal work not involving practice before the courts (not even in a preparatory manner as performed by solicitors in England), though some might practise before chambers judges.

The situation is somewhat different in Quebec as a result of its [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] tradition. The profession of solicitor, or ''avoué'', never took hold in colonial Quebec, so attorneys&lt;ref&gt;Here the term ''attorney'' may be preferable as an ''avocat'' is very much like an American attorney in that he/she may be both a trial and case lawyer.&lt;/ref&gt; (''avocats'') have traditionally been a fused profession, arguing and preparing cases in contentious matters, whereas Quebec's other type of lawyer, [[civil law notary|civil-law notaries]] (''notaires''), handle out-of-court non-contentious matters. However, a number of areas of non-contentious [[private law]] are not monopolized by notaries so that attorneys often specialise in handling either trials, cases, advising, or non-trial matters. The only disadvantage is that attorneys cannot draw up [[public instrument]]s that have the same force of law as [[act (document)|notarial acts]]. Most large law firms in Quebec offer the full range of legal services of law firms in common-law provinces. Intending Quebec attorneys must earn a Bachelor's degree in civil law, pass the provincial bar examination, and successfully complete a legal internship to be admitted to practice. Attorneys are regulated by the Quebec Law Society (''Barreau du Québec'').

=== England and Wales ===
{{main|Barristers in England and Wales}}
[[Image:Gray's inn zzz.JPG|thumb|[[Gray's Inn]], [[London]]]]
Although [[England and Wales]] are separate in some aspects of the political structure of the [[United Kingdom]], they compose a single legal jurisdiction. Accordingly, they are served by a single bar.

The profession of barrister in England and Wales is a separate profession from that of solicitor. It is, however, possible to hold the qualification of both barrister and solicitor at the same time. It is not necessary to leave the bar to qualify as a solicitor.

Barristers are regulated by the Bar Standards Board, a division of the General Council of the Bar. A barrister must be a member of one of the [[Inns of Court]], which traditionally educated and regulated barristers. There are four Inns of Court: [[Gray's Inn|The Honourable Society of Gray's Inn]], [[Lincoln's Inn|The Honourable Society of Lincoln's Inn]], [[Middle Temple|The Honourable Society of the Middle Temple]], and [[Inner Temple|The Honourable Society of the Inner Temple]]. All are situated in central London, near the [[Royal Courts of Justice]]. They perform scholastic and social roles, and in all cases, provide financial aid to student barristers (subject to merit) through scholarships. It is the Inns that actually &quot;call&quot; the student to the Bar at a ceremony similar to a graduation. Social functions include dining with other members and guests and hosting other events. 

Student barristers must take a [[Bar Professional Training Course]] (BPTC - previously Bar Vocational Course or BVC) (usually one year full-time) at one of the institutions authorised by the Bar Council to offer the BPTC.&lt;ref&gt;Qualification details of English Bar, [http://thepupillagepages.com/ http://thepupillagepages.com/]&lt;/ref&gt; On successful completion of the BPTC student barristers are &quot;called&quot; to the bar by their respective inns and are elevated to the degree of &quot;Barrister&quot;. However, before they can practise independently they must first undertake 12 months of [[pupillage]]. The first six months of this period is spent shadowing more senior practitioners, after which pupil barristers may begin to undertake some court work of their own. Following successful completion of this stage, most barristers then join a set of Chambers, a group of counsel who share the costs of premises and support staff whilst remaining individually self-employed.

In December 2004 there were just over 11,500 barristers in independent practice, of whom about ten percent are [[Queen's Counsel]] and the remainder are [[junior barrister]]s. Many barristers (about 2,800) are employed in companies as 'in-house' counsel, or by local or national government or in academic institutions.

Certain barristers in England and Wales are now instructed directly by members of the public.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barcouncil.org.uk/about/find-a-barrister/public-access-directory/ Public Access Directory of The Bar Council]&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the public may engage the services of the barrister directly; a solicitor is not involved at any stage. Barristers undertaking public access work can provide legal advice and representation in court in almost all areas of law (see the [http://www.barcouncil.org.uk/guidance/publicaccessinformationforlayclients/ Public Access Information on the Bar Council website]) and are entitled to represent clients in any court or tribunal in England and Wales. Once instructions from a client are accepted, it is the barrister (rather than the solicitor) who advises and guides the client through the relevant legal procedure or litigation.

Before a barrister can undertake Public Access work, he must have completed a special course. At present, about 1 in 20 barristers have so qualified. There is also a separate scheme called 'Licensed Access', available to certain nominated classes of professional client; it is not open to the general public.

The ability of barristers to accept such instructions is a recent development; it results from a change in the rules set down by the General Council of the Bar in July 2004. The Public Access Scheme has been introduced as part of the drive to open up the legal system to the public and to make it easier and cheaper to obtain access to legal advice. It further reduces the distinction between solicitors and barristers. The distinction remains however because there are certain aspects of a solicitor's role that a barrister is not able to undertake.

=== France ===
In [[France]], ''avocats'', or attorneys, were, until the 20th century, the equivalent of barristers. The profession included several grades ranked by seniority: ''stagiaire'' (pupil, student-at-law), ''plaignant'' (junior barrister), and ''consultant'' (senior barrister). Since the 14th century and during the course of the 19th in particular, French barristers competed in territorial battles over respective areas of legal practice against the ''conseil juridique'' (chamber-counselor) and ''avoué'' (solicitor), and expanded to become the generalist legal practitioner. After the 1971 and 1990 legal reforms, the ''avocat'' was fused with the solicitor and chamber-counselor, making the ''avocat'' (or, if female, ''avocate'') an all-purpose lawyer for matters of contentious jurisdiction, analogous to an American attorney. French attorneys may specialize as litigators (trial lawyers) and legal consultants (advising lawyers), known respectively as ''avocat plaidant'' and ''avocat-conseil''. All intending attorneys must pass a legal practice examination and two-year traineeship to be admitted to general practice and enrolled, but to have rights of audience at a given court, an attorney must join that court's bar (''barreau'') by passing its specific bar examination. Each bar is regulated by a Bar Council (''Ordre du barreau'').

=== Germany ===
In [[Germany]], lawyers may only plead at the Federal Court of Justice (''Bundesgerichtshof'') if they are admitted to that court.&lt;ref&gt;§ 78 of the ''Zivilprozessordnung''.&lt;/ref&gt; Fewer than 50 lawyers are admitted to the Bundesgerichtshof;&lt;ref&gt;As of 25 September 2007. See the list of lawyers admitted to the ''Bundesgerichtshof'':[http://www.bundesgerichtshof.de/bgh/rechtsanwaelte.php]&lt;/ref&gt; those lawyers may not plead at other courts, do in practice deal with litigation only, and are usually instructed by a lawyer who represented the client at lower courts. However, those restrictions do not apply to criminal cases, and not to pleadings at courts of the other court systems (neither to the labour, administrative, taxation, and social courts, nor to the EU court system).

=== Hong Kong ===
{{main|Hong Kong Bar Association}}
The legal profession in [[Hong Kong]] is also divided into two branches: barristers (where the [[Cantonese]] name ''daai lut si'', ''大律師'' is also used) and [[solicitor]]s (where the [[Cantonese]] name ''lut si'', ''律師'' is also used). 

In [[Hong Kong]], the rank of [[Queen's Counsel]] was granted prior to the [[transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong]] to [[People's Republic of China|China]] in 1997. After the handover to China, the rank has been replaced by [[Senior Counsel]] ([[post-nominal letters|postnominal]] '''SC'''). Senior Counsel may still, however, style themselves as silks, like their British counterparts.

=== Ireland ===
In the [[Republic of Ireland]], admission to the Bar by the Chief Justice of Ireland is restricted to those on whom a Barrister-at-Law degree (B.L.) has first been conferred. [[King's Inns|The Honorable Society of King's Inns]]&lt;!-- without a &quot;u&quot; --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Note: the historical spelling variant ''Honorable'', not the contemporary Honourable&lt;/ref&gt; is the only educational establishment with runs vocational courses for barristers in the Republic and degrees of Barrister-at-Law can only be conferred by King's Inns. King's Inns are also the only body with the capacity to call individuals to the bar and to disbar them.

Most Irish barristers choose to be governed thereafter by the [[Bar Council of Ireland]], a quasi-private entity. Senior members of the profession may be selected for elevation to the Inner Bar, when they may describe themselves as Senior Counsel (&quot;S.C.&quot;). Admission to the Inner Bar is made by declaration before the [[Supreme Court of Ireland|Supreme Court]], [[patent of precedence|patents of precedence]] having been granted by the [[Government of Ireland|Government]]. Irish barristers are sole practitioners and may not form chambers or partnerships if they wish to remain members of the Bar Council's Law Library.

To practise under the Bar Council of Ireland's rules, a newly qualified barrister is apprenticed to an experienced barrister of at least seven years' experience. This apprenticeship is known as [[pupillage]] or [[devilling]]. Devilling is compulsory for those barristers who wish to be members of the Law Library and lasts for one legal year. It is common to devil for a second year in a less formal arrangement but this is not compulsory. 

In February 2007, the Irish Government's Better Regulation Unit (a branch of the [[Department of the Taoiseach]]) found that there was no statutory basis for the Bar Council of Ireland's setting and enforcing of professional standards for Irish barristers.&lt;ref&gt;Better Regulation, [http://www.betterregulation.ie/eng/Publications/Bodies_in_Ireland_with_Regulatory_Powers.doc &quot;Bodies in Ireland with Regulatory Powers&quot;], p.58&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Japan ===
The legal professionals in Japan are mainly divided into two branches. [[Lawyer]]s usually refer to barristers. [[Scriveners]] mean [[solicitor]]s. There are also two kinds of scriveners: [[administrative scriveners]] and [[judicial scriveners]].

=== Nigeria ===
In [[Nigeria]], there is no formal distinction between barristers and solicitors. All students who pass the bar examinations—offered exclusively by the [[Nigerian Law School]]—are called to the Nigerian bar, by the Body of Benchers. Lawyers may argue in any Federal trial or appellate court as well as any of the courts in Nigeria's 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory. The Legal Practitioner's Act, refers to Nigerian lawyers as Legal Practitioners, and following their [[call to the Bar]], Nigerian lawyers enter their names in the register or Roll of Legal Practitioners kept at the Supreme Court. Perhaps for this reason, a Nigerian lawyer is also often referred to as a Barrister and Solicitor of the Supreme Court of Nigeria, and many Nigerian lawyers term themselves Barrister-at-Law complete with the postnominal initials &quot;B.L.&quot;. 

The vast majority of Nigerian lawyers combine contentious and non-contentious work, although there is a growing tendency for practitioners in the bigger practices to specialise in one or the other. In colloquial parlance within the Nigerian legal profession, lawyers may for this reason be referred to as &quot;litigators&quot; or as &quot;solicitors&quot;. 

Consistent with the practice in England and elsewhere in the Commonwealth, senior members of the profession may be selected for elevation to the Inner Bar by conferment of the rank of [[Senior Advocate of Nigeria]] (SAN).

=== Northern Ireland ===
In April 2003 there were 554 barristers in independent practice in [[Northern Ireland]]. 66 were [[Queen's Counsel]] (QCs), barristers who have earned a high reputation and are appointed by the Queen on the recommendation of the Lord Chancellor as senior advocates and advisers. 

Those barristers who are not QCs are called Junior Counsel and are styled &quot;BL&quot; or &quot;Barrister-at-Law&quot;. The term &quot;junior&quot; is often misleading since many members of the Junior Bar are experienced barristers with considerable expertise.

[[Bencher]]s are, and have been for centuries, the governing bodies of the four [[Inns of Court]] in London and [[King's Inns]], Dublin. The Benchers of the [[Inn of Court of Northern Ireland]] governed the Inn until the enactment of the Constitution of the Inn in 1983, which provides that the government of the Inn is shared between the Benchers, the Executive Council of the Inn and members of the Inn assembled in General Meeting.

The Executive Council (through its Education Committee) is responsible for considering Memorials submitted by applicants for admission as students of the Inn and by Bar students of the Inn for admission to the degree of Barrister-at-Law and making recommendations to the Benchers. The final decisions on these Memorials are taken by the Benchers. The Benchers also have the exclusive power of expelling or suspending a Bar student and of disbarring a barrister or suspending a barrister from practice.

The Executive Council is also involved with: education; fees of students; calling counsel to the Bar, although call to the Bar is performed by the [[Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland]] on the invitation of the Benchers; administration of the Bar Library (to which all practising members of the Bar belong); and liaising with corresponding bodies in other countries.

The Bar Council is responsible for the maintenance of the standards, honour and independence of the Bar and, through its Professional Conduct Committee, receives and investigates complaints against members of the Bar in their professional capacity.

=== Scotland and the Crown Dependencies ===
{{main|Advocate}}

In Scotland an [[advocate]] is, in all respects except name, a barrister, but there are significant differences in professional practice.

In Scotland, admission to and the conduct of the profession is regulated by the [[Faculty of Advocates]] (as opposed to an Inn).

In the Bailiwick of Jersey, there are solicitors (called ''ecrivains'') and advocates (French ''avocat''). In the Bailiwick of Jersey, the Bailiwick of Guernsey and the Isle of Man, Advocates perform the combined functions of both solicitors and barristers.

=== South Africa ===
In [[South Africa]] the employment and practice of barristers (known as advocates) is consistent with the Commonwealth. Advocates carry the rank of Junior and Senior Counsel (SC), and are mostly briefed and paid by solicitors (known as attorneys). They are usually employed in the higher courts, particularly the Appeal Courts where they often appear as specialist counsel. South African solicitors (attorneys) follow a practice of referring cases to Counsel for an opinion before proceeding with a case, when Counsel in question practices as a specialist in the case law at stake. Aspirant advocates currently spend two years in pupillage (formerly only three months) before being admitted to the bar in their respective provincial or judicial jurisdictions. The term 'Advocate' is sometimes used in South Africa as a title, e. g. 'Advocate John Doe, SC' ('Advokaat' in Afrikaans) in the same fashion as 'Dr. John Doe' for a medical doctor.

===South Korea ===
There is no distinction between two branches. A person who passed the national bar exam, after 2 years of national education, becomes a judge, a prosecutor or a &quot;lawyer&quot; in accordance of their grades upon graduation. A &quot;lawyer&quot; does not have any limitation of practice.

=== Spain ===
Spain has a division that somewhat corresponds to the division in Britain between barristers/advocates and solicitors. ''Procuradores'' represent the litigant procedurally in court, generally under the authority of a power of attorney executed by a civil law notary, while ''abogados'' represent the substantive claims of the litigant through trial advocacy. Essentially, Procuradores are court agents and their practice is confined to the locality of the court to which they are admitted. Procuradores are regulated by Royal Decree 2046 of 1982, which approved the General Statute of the Procuradores, and the Organic Law no.6 of 1985. The General Statute regulates the qualifications and conduct of the procuradores. Thus, obligations to act ''pro bono'' are laid down by Article 13.

=== United States ===
The [[United States]] does not draw a distinction between lawyers as pleaders (barristers) and lawyers as agents (or solicitors). All lawyers who have passed a [[bar examination]] and have been admitted to practice may prosecute or defend in the courts of the state where they are admitted. Yet, historically, a distinction was made, and a separate barrister existed in certain states, called a ''counselor'', though both professions have long since been fused into the all-purpose attorney. Attorneys specializing in court procedure, combining advocacy and case preparation, are called trial attorneys. 

Some state appellate courts require attorneys to obtain a separate certificate of admission to plead and practice in the appellate court. Federal courts require specific admission to that court's bar to practice before it. At the state appellate level and in Federal courts, there is generally no separate examination process, although some U.S. district courts require an examination on practices and procedures in their specific courts. Unless an examination is required, admission is usually granted as a matter of course to any licensed attorney in the state where the court is located. Some federal courts will grant admission to any attorney licensed in any U.S. jurisdiction.

The '''Battle of Gettysburg''' (locally {{IPA-en|ˈɡɛtɨsbɜrɡ||En-Gettysburg-local.ogg}}, with an ''ss'' sound),&lt;ref&gt;Robert D. Quigley, ''Civil War Spoken Here: A Dictionary of Mispronounced People, Places and Things of the 1860's'' (Collingswood, NJ: C. W. Historicals, 1993), p. 68. ISBN 0-9637745-0-6.&lt;/ref&gt; was fought July 1&amp;ndash;3, 1863, in and around the town of [[Gettysburg, Pennsylvania|Gettysburg]], [[Pennsylvania]]. The battle with the largest number of casualties in the [[American Civil War]],&lt;ref&gt;The [[Battle of Antietam]], the culmination of Lee's first invasion of the North, had the largest number of casualties in a single day, about 23,000.&lt;/ref&gt; it is often described as the war's [[Turning point of the American Civil War|turning point]].&lt;ref name=TP&gt;Rawley, p. 147; Sauers, p. 827; Gallagher, ''Lee and His Army'', p. 83; McPherson, p. 665; Eicher, p. 550. Gallagher and McPherson cite the combination of Gettysburg and Vicksburg as the turning point. Eicher uses the arguably related expression, &quot;[[High-water mark of the Confederacy]]&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Union Army|Union]] [[Major general (United States)|Maj. Gen.]] [[George Gordon Meade]]'s [[Army of the Potomac]] defeated attacks by [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] [[General (CSA)|Gen.]] [[Robert E. Lee]]'s [[Army of Northern Virginia]], ending Lee's invasion of the North.

After his success at [[Battle of Chancellorsville|Chancellorsville]] in [[Virginia]] in May 1863, Lee led his army through the [[Shenandoah Valley]] to begin his second invasion of the North&amp;mdash;the [[Gettysburg Campaign]]. With his army in high spirits, Lee intended to shift the focus of the summer campaign from war-ravaged northern Virginia and hoped to influence Northern politicians to give up their prosecution of the war by penetrating as far as [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania]], or even [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]]. Prodded by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Abraham Lincoln]], Maj. Gen. [[Joseph Hooker]] moved his army in pursuit, but was relieved just three days before the battle and replaced by Meade.

Elements of the two armies initially collided at Gettysburg on July 1, 1863, as Lee urgently concentrated his forces there, his objective being to engage the Union army and destroy it. Low ridges to the northwest of town were defended initially by a Union cavalry division under Brig. Gen. [[John Buford]], and soon reinforced with two [[corps]] of Union [[infantry]]. However, two large Confederate corps assaulted them from the northwest and north, collapsing the hastily developed Union lines, sending the defenders retreating through the streets of town to the hills just to the south.

On the second day of battle, most of both armies had assembled. The Union line was laid out in a defensive formation resembling a fishhook. In the late afternoon of July 2, Lee launched a heavy assault on the Union left flank, and fierce fighting raged at [[Little Round Top]], the [[Battle of Gettysburg, Second Day#Wheatfield|Wheatfield]], [[Devil's Den]], and the [[Battle of Gettysburg, Second Day#Peach Orchard|Peach Orchard]]. On the Union right, [[demonstration (military)|demonstrations]] escalated into full-scale assaults on [[Culp's Hill]] and [[Cemetery Hill]]. All across the battlefield, despite significant losses, the Union defenders held their lines.

On the third day of battle, July 3, fighting resumed on Culp's Hill, and cavalry battles raged to the east and south, but the main event was a dramatic infantry assault by 12,500 Confederates against the center of the Union line on [[Cemetery Ridge]], known as [[Pickett's Charge]]. The charge was repulsed by Union [[Civil War rifles|rifle]] and artillery fire, at great losses to the Confederate army. Lee led his army on a torturous [[Retreat from Gettysburg|retreat back to Virginia]]. Between 46,000 and 51,000 soldiers from both armies were casualties in the three-day battle. That November, President Lincoln used the dedication ceremony for the [[Gettysburg National Cemetery]] to honor the fallen Union soldiers and redefine the purpose of the war in his historic [[Gettysburg Address]].

Shortly after the Army of Northern Virginia won a major victory over the Army of the Potomac at the [[Battle of Chancellorsville]] (April 30&amp;nbsp;– May 6, 1863), Robert E. Lee decided upon a second invasion of the North (the first was the unsuccessful [[Maryland Campaign]] of September 1862, which ended in the bloody [[Battle of Antietam]]). Such a move would upset [[Union (American Civil War)|Federal]] plans for the summer campaigning season and possibly reduce the pressure on the besieged Confederate garrison at [[Vicksburg, Mississippi|Vicksburg]]. The invasion would allow the Confederates to live off the bounty of the rich Northern farms while giving war-ravaged [[Virginia]] a much-needed rest. In addition, Lee's 72,000-man army&lt;ref name=BM260/&gt; could threaten Philadelphia, [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]], and [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], and possibly strengthen the growing peace movement in the North.&lt;ref&gt;Coddington, pp. 8–9; Eicher, p. 490.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, on June 3, Lee's army began to shift northward from [[Fredericksburg, Virginia]]. To attain more efficiency in his command, Lee had reorganized his two large corps into three new corps. [[Lieutenant General (CSA)|Lt. Gen.]] [[James Longstreet]] retained command of his First Corps. The old corps of deceased [[Stonewall Jackson|Thomas J. &quot;Stonewall&quot; Jackson]] was divided in two, with the Second Corps going to Lt. Gen. [[Richard S. Ewell]] and the new Third Corps to Lt. Gen. [[A.P. Hill]]. The Cavalry Division was commanded by Maj. Gen. [[J.E.B. Stuart]].&lt;ref&gt;Eicher, p. 491.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Union Army of the Potomac, under Maj. Gen. [[Joseph Hooker]], consisted of seven infantry corps, a cavalry corps, and an Artillery Reserve, for a combined strength of about 94,000 men.&lt;ref name=BM125/&gt; However, President Lincoln replaced Hooker with Maj. Gen. [[George Gordon Meade]], a [[Pennsylvania]]n, because of Hooker's defeat at [[Battle of Chancellorsville|Chancellorsville]] and his timid response to Lee's second invasion north of the [[Potomac River]].

The first major action of the campaign took place on June 9 between opposing cavalry forces at [[Battle of Brandy Station|Brandy Station]], near [[Culpeper, Virginia]]. The 9,500 Confederate cavalrymen under Stuart were surprised by Maj. Gen. [[Alfred Pleasonton]]'s [[combined arms]] force of two cavalry divisions (8,000 troopers) and 3,000 infantry, but Stuart eventually repulsed the Union attack. The inconclusive battle, the largest predominantly cavalry engagement of the war, proved for the first time that the Union horse soldier was equal to his Southern counterpart.&lt;ref&gt;Symonds, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

By mid-June, the Army of Northern Virginia was poised to cross the Potomac River and enter [[Maryland]]. After defeating the Federal garrisons at [[Second Battle of Winchester|Winchester]] and [[Martinsburg, West Virginia|Martinsburg]], Ewell's Second Corps began crossing the river on June 15. Hill's and Longstreet's corps followed on June 24 and June 25. Hooker's army pursued, keeping between the U.S. capital and Lee's army. The Federals crossed the Potomac from June 25 to June 27.&lt;ref&gt;Trudeau, pp. 45, 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lee gave strict orders for his army to minimize any negative impacts on the civilian population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=YmsFAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=titlepage#PRA1-PA323,M1 Lee's orders from Chambersburg, June 27, 1863]&lt;/ref&gt; Food, horses, and other supplies were generally not seized outright, although quartermasters reimbursing Northern farmers and merchants with [[Confederate States of America dollar|Confederate money]] were not well received. Various towns, most notably [[York, Pennsylvania]], were required to pay indemnities in lieu of supplies, under threat of destruction. During the invasion, the Confederates seized some 40 northern [[African Americans]], a few of whom were escaped fugitive [[History of slavery in the United States|slaves]] but most were freemen. They were sent south into slavery under guard.&lt;ref&gt;Symonds, pp. 49–54.&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 26, elements of Maj. Gen. [[Jubal Early]]'s division of Ewell's Corps occupied the town of Gettysburg after chasing off newly raised Pennsylvania [[militia]] in a series of minor skirmishes. Early laid the borough under tribute but did not collect any significant supplies. Soldiers burned several railroad cars and a [[covered bridge]], and destroyed nearby rails and [[telegraph]] lines. The following morning, Early departed for adjacent [[York County, Pennsylvania|York County]].&lt;ref&gt;Nye, pp. 272–78.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, in a controversial move, Lee allowed Jeb Stuart to take a portion of the army's cavalry and ride around the east flank of the Union army. Lee's orders gave Stuart much latitude, and both generals share the blame for the long absence of Stuart's cavalry, as well as for the failure to assign a more active role to the cavalry left with the army. Stuart and his three best brigades were absent from the army during the crucial phase of the approach to Gettysburg and the first two days of battle. By June 29, Lee's army was strung out in an arc from [[Chambersburg, Pennsylvania|Chambersburg]] (28 miles (45&amp;nbsp;km) northwest of Gettysburg) to [[Carlisle, Pennsylvania|Carlisle]] (30 miles (48&amp;nbsp;km) north of Gettysburg) to near [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Harrisburg]] and [[Wrightsville, Pennsylvania|Wrightsville]] on the [[Susquehanna River]].&lt;ref&gt;Symonds, pp. 41–43; Sears, pp. 103–06; Esposito, text for Map 94 ([http://www.military.com/Resources/ResourceFileView/civilwar_maps_map34_largerview.htm Map 34b] in the online version); Eicher, pp. 504–07; McPherson, p. 649.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a dispute over the use of the forces defending the [[Harpers Ferry, West Virginia|Harpers Ferry]] garrison, Hooker offered his resignation, and [[Abraham Lincoln]] and General-in-Chief [[Henry W. Halleck]], who were looking for an excuse to get rid of him, immediately accepted. They replaced Hooker early on the morning of June 28 with Maj. Gen. George Gordon Meade, then commander of the [[V Corps (Union Army)|V Corps]].&lt;ref&gt;Sears, p. 123; Trudeau, p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 29, when Lee learned that the Army of the Potomac had crossed the Potomac River, he ordered a concentration of his forces around [[Cashtown-McKnightstown, Pennsylvania|Cashtown]], located at the eastern base of [[South Mountain (Maryland and Pennsylvania)|South Mountain]] and eight miles (13&amp;nbsp;km) west of Gettysburg.&lt;ref&gt;Coddington, pp. 181, 189.&lt;/ref&gt; On June 30, while part of Hill's Corps was in Cashtown, one of Hill's brigades, North Carolinians under [[Brigadier General (CSA)|Brig. Gen.]] [[J. Johnston Pettigrew]], ventured toward Gettysburg. In his memoirs, Maj. Gen. [[Henry Heth]], Pettigrew's division commander, claimed that he sent Pettigrew to search for supplies in town&amp;mdash;especially shoes.&lt;ref&gt;Eicher, pp. 508–09, discounts Heth's claim because the previous visit by Early to Gettysburg would have made the lack of shoe factories or stores obvious. However, many mainstream historians accept Heth's account: Sears, p. 136; Foote, p. 465; Clark, p. 35; Tucker, pp. 97–98; Martin, p. 25; Pfanz, ''First Day'', p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

When Pettigrew's troops approached Gettysburg on June 30, they noticed Union cavalry under Brig. Gen. [[John Buford]] arriving south of town, and Pettigrew returned to Cashtown without engaging them. When Pettigrew told Hill and Heth what he had seen, neither general believed that there was a substantial Federal force in or near the town, suspecting that it had been only Pennsylvania militia. Despite General Lee's order to avoid a general engagement until his entire army was concentrated, Hill decided to mount a significant [[Reconnaissance#In-force|reconnaissance in force]] the following morning to determine the size and strength of the enemy force in his front. Around 5 a.m. on Wednesday, July 1, two brigades of Heth's division advanced to Gettysburg.&lt;ref&gt;Eicher, p. 508; Tucker, pp. 99–102.&lt;/ref&gt;

==First day of battle==
{{Further|[[Battle of Gettysburg, First Day]]}}
[[File:Gettysburg Battle Map Day1.png|thumb|350px|Overview map of the first day of the Battle of Gettysburg, July 1, 1863]]

Anticipating that the Confederates would march on Gettysburg from the west on the morning of July 1, Buford laid out his defenses on three ridges west of the town: Herr Ridge, McPherson Ridge, and Seminary Ridge. These were appropriate terrain for a delaying action by his small cavalry division against superior Confederate infantry forces, meant to buy time awaiting the arrival of Union infantrymen who could occupy the strong defensive positions south of town at [[Cemetery Hill]], [[Cemetery Ridge]], and [[Culp's Hill]]. Buford understood that if the Confederates could gain control of these heights, Meade's army would have difficulty dislodging them.&lt;ref&gt;Sears, pp. 155–58.&lt;/ref&gt;

Heth's division advanced with two brigades forward, commanded by Brig. Gens. [[James J. Archer]] and [[Joseph R. Davis]]. They proceeded easterly in columns along the Chambersburg Pike. Three miles (5&amp;nbsp;km) west of town, about 7:30 a.m. on July 1, the two brigades met light resistance from [[vedette]]s of Union cavalry, and deployed into line. According to lore, the Union soldier to fire the first shot of the battle was Lt. [[Marcellus Jones]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historynet.com/magazines/american_civil_war/3430626.html Battle of Gettysburg: &quot;Who Really Fired the First Shot?&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1886 Lt. Jones returned to Gettysburg to mark the spot where he fired the first shot with a monument.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brotherswar.com/Gettysburg-Day-1Pic-15.htm Marcellus Jones Monument at Gettysburg]&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, Heth's men reached dismounted troopers of Col. [[William Gamble (USA)|William Gamble's]] cavalry brigade, who raised determined resistance and delaying tactics from behind fence posts with fire from their breechloading [[carbine]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, pp. 80–81. The troopers carried single-shot, breechloading carbines manufactured by [[Sharps Rifle Manufacturing Company|Sharps]], Burnside, and others. It is a modern myth that they were armed with multi-shot repeating carbines. Nevertheless, they were able to fire two or three times faster than a muzzle-loaded carbine or rifle.&lt;/ref&gt; Still, by 10:20 a.m., the Confederates had pushed the Union cavalrymen east to McPherson Ridge, when the vanguard of the [[I Corps (Union Army)|I Corps]] (Maj. Gen. [[John F. Reynolds]]) finally arrived.&lt;ref&gt;Symonds, p. 71; Coddington, p. 266; Eicher, pp. 510–11.&lt;/ref&gt;

North of the pike, Davis gained a temporary success against Brig. Gen. [[Lysander Cutler]]'s brigade but was repulsed with heavy losses in an action around an unfinished railroad bed cut in the ridge. South of the pike, Archer's brigade assaulted through Herbst (also known as McPherson's) Woods. The Federal [[Iron Brigade]] under Brig. Gen. [[Solomon Meredith]] enjoyed initial success against Archer, capturing several hundred men, including Archer himself.&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, pp. 112–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

General Reynolds was shot and killed early in the fighting while directing troop and artillery placements just to the east of the woods. Shelby Foote wrote that the Union cause lost a man considered by many to be &quot;the best general in the army.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Foote, p. 468&lt;/ref&gt; Maj. Gen. [[Abner Doubleday]] assumed command. Fighting in the Chambersburg Pike area lasted until about 12:30 p.m. It resumed around 2:30 p.m., when Heth's entire division engaged, adding the brigades of Pettigrew and Col. [[John M. Brockenbrough]].&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, p. 184; Symonds, p. 74; Pfanz, ''First Day'', pp. 269–75.&lt;/ref&gt;

As Pettigrew's North Carolina Brigade came on line, they flanked the 19th Indiana and drove the Iron Brigade back. The 26th North Carolina (the largest regiment in the army with 839 men) lost heavily, leaving the first day's fight with around 212 men. By the end of the three-day battle, they had about 152 men standing, the highest casualty percentage for one battle of any regiment, North or South.&lt;ref&gt;Busey and Martin, pp. 298, 501.&lt;/ref&gt; Slowly the Iron Brigade was pushed out of the woods toward Seminary Ridge. Hill added Maj. Gen. [[William Dorsey Pender]]'s division to the assault, and the I Corps was driven back through the grounds of the [[Lutheran Theological Seminary at Gettysburg|Lutheran Seminary]] and Gettysburg streets.&lt;ref&gt;Pfanz, ''First Day'', pp. 275–93.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the fighting to the west proceeded, two divisions of Ewell's Second Corps, marching west toward Cashtown in accordance with Lee's order for the army to concentrate in that vicinity, turned south on the Carlisle and Harrisburg roads toward Gettysburg, while the Union [[XI Corps (Union Army)|XI Corps]] (Maj. Gen. [[Oliver O. Howard]]) raced north on the Baltimore Pike and Taneytown Road. By early afternoon, the Federal line ran in a semicircle west, north, and northeast of Gettysburg.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the Federals did not have enough troops; Cutler, who was deployed north of the Chambersburg Pike, had his right flank in the air. The leftmost division of the XI Corps was unable to deploy in time to strengthen the line, so Doubleday was forced to throw in reserve brigades to salvage his line.&lt;ref&gt;Pfanz, ''First Day'', p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 2 p.m., the Confederate Second Corps divisions of Maj. Gens. [[Robert E. Rodes]] and Jubal Early assaulted and out-flanked the Union I and XI Corps positions north and northwest of town. The Confederate brigades of Col. [[Edward A. O'Neal]] and Brig. Gen. [[Alfred Iverson, Jr.|Alfred Iverson]] suffered severe losses assaulting the I Corps division of Brig. Gen. [[John C. Robinson]] south of Oak Hill. Early's division profited from a blunder by Brig. Gen. [[Francis C. Barlow]], when he advanced his XI Corps division to Blocher's Knoll (directly north of town and now known as Barlow's Knoll); this represented a [[Salients, re-entrants and pockets|salient]]&lt;ref&gt;Pfanz, ''First Day'', p. 230.&lt;/ref&gt; in the corps line, susceptible to attack from multiple sides, and Early's troops overran Barlow's division, which constituted the right flank of the Union Army's position. Barlow was wounded and captured in the attack.&lt;ref&gt;Pfanz, ''First Day'', pp. 156–238.&lt;/ref&gt;

As Federal positions collapsed both north and west of town, Gen. Howard ordered a retreat to the high ground south of town at Cemetery Hill, where he had left the division of Brig. Gen. [[Adolph von Steinwehr]] in reserve.&lt;ref&gt;Pfanz, ''First Day'', p. 294.&lt;/ref&gt; Maj. Gen. [[Winfield S. Hancock]] assumed command of the battlefield, sent by Meade when he heard that Reynolds had been killed. Hancock, commander of the [[II Corps (Union Army)|II Corps]] and Meade's most trusted subordinate, was ordered to take command of the field and to determine whether Gettysburg was an appropriate place for a major battle.&lt;ref&gt;Pfanz, ''First Day'', pp. 337–38; Sears, pp. 223–25.&lt;/ref&gt; Hancock told Howard, &quot;I think this the strongest position by nature upon which to fight a battle that I ever saw.&quot; When Howard agreed, Hancock concluded the discussion: &quot;Very well, sir, I select this as the battle-field.&quot; Hancock's determination had a morale-boosting effect on the retreating Union soldiers, but he played no direct tactical role on the first day.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, pp. 482–88.&lt;/ref&gt;

General Lee understood the defensive potential to the Union if they held this high ground. He sent orders to Ewell that Cemetery Hill be taken &quot;if practicable.&quot; Ewell, who had previously served under Stonewall Jackson, a general well known for issuing peremptory orders, determined such an assault was not practicable and, thus, did not attempt it; this decision is considered by historians to be a great missed opportunity.&lt;ref&gt;Pfanz, ''First Day'', p. 344; Eicher, p. 517; Sears, p. 228; Trudeau, p. 253. Both Sears and Trudeau record &quot;if possible.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

The first day at Gettysburg, more significant than simply a prelude to the bloody second and third days, ranks as the 23rd biggest battle of the war by number of troops engaged. About one quarter of Meade's army (22,000 men) and one third of Lee's army (27,000) were engaged.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, p. 9, citing Thomas L. Livermore's ''Numbers &amp; Losses in the Civil War in America'' (Houghton Mifflin, 1900).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second day of battle==
[[File:Gettysburg Day2 Plan.png|thumb|350px|[[Robert E. Lee]]'s plan for July 2, 1863]]
{{Further|[[Battle of Gettysburg, Second Day|Second Day]], [[Little Round Top]], [[Culp's Hill]], and [[Cemetery Hill]]}}

===Plans and movement to battle===
Throughout the evening of July 1 and morning of July 2, most of the remaining infantry of both armies arrived on the field, including the Union [[II Corps (Union Army)|II]], [[III Corps (Union Army)|III]], [[V Corps (Union Army)|V]], [[VI Corps (Union Army)|VI]], and [[XII Corps (Union Army)|XII Corps]]. Longstreet's third division, commanded by Maj. Gen. [[George Pickett]], had begun the march from Chambersburg early in the morning; it did not arrive until late on July 2.&lt;ref&gt;Coddington, p. 333; Tucker, p. 327.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Union line ran from Culp's Hill southeast of the town, northwest to Cemetery Hill just south of town, then south for nearly two miles (3&amp;nbsp;km) along Cemetery Ridge, terminating just north of Little Round Top. Most of the XII Corps was on Culp's Hill; the remnants of I and XI Corps defended Cemetery Hill; II Corps covered most of the northern half of Cemetery Ridge; and III Corps was ordered to take up a position to its flank. The shape of the Union line is popularly described as a &quot;fishhook&quot; formation. The Confederate line paralleled the Union line about a mile (1,600 m) to the west on Seminary Ridge, ran east through the town, then curved southeast to a point opposite Culp's Hill. Thus, the Federal army had interior lines, while the Confederate line was nearly five miles (8&amp;nbsp;km) long.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, p. 74; Eicher, p. 521.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lee's battle plan for July 2 called for Longstreet's First Corps to position itself stealthily to attack the Union left flank, facing northeast astraddle the [[Emmitsburg]] Road, and to roll up the Federal line. The attack sequence was to begin with Maj. Gens. [[John Bell Hood]]'s and [[Lafayette McLaws]]'s divisions, followed by Maj. Gen. [[Richard H. Anderson]]'s division of Hill's Third Corps. The progressive [[echelon formation|''en echelon'']] sequence of this attack would prevent Meade from shifting troops from his center to bolster his left. At the same time, Maj. Gen. [[Edward Johnson (general)|Edward &quot;Allegheny&quot; Johnson's]] and Jubal Early's Second Corps divisions were to make a [[demonstration (military)|demonstration]] against Culp's and Cemetery Hills (again, to prevent the shifting of Federal troops), and to turn the demonstration into a full-scale attack if a favorable opportunity presented itself.&lt;ref&gt;Sears, p. 255; Clark, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lee's plan, however, was based on faulty intelligence, exacerbated by Stuart's continued absence from the battlefield. Instead of moving beyond the Federals' left and attacking their flank, Longstreet's left division, under McLaws, would face Maj. Gen. [[Daniel Sickles]]'s III Corps directly in their path. Sickles had been dissatisfied with the position assigned him on the southern end of Cemetery Ridge. Seeing higher ground more favorable to artillery positions a half mile (800 m) to the west, he advanced his corps&amp;mdash;without orders&amp;mdash;to the slightly higher ground along the Emmitsburg Road. The new line ran from Devil's Den, northwest to the Sherfy farm's Peach Orchard, then northeast along the Emmitsburg Road to south of the Codori farm. This created an untenable salient at the Peach Orchard; Brig. Gen. [[Andrew A. Humphreys]]'s division (in position along the Emmitsburg Road) and Maj. Gen. [[David B. Birney]]'s division (to the south) were subject to attacks from two sides and were spread out over a longer front than their small corps could defend effectively.&lt;ref&gt;Pfanz, ''Second Day'', pp. 93–97; Eicher, pp. 523–24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Longstreet's attack was to be made as early as practicable; however, Longstreet got permission from Lee to await the arrival of one of his brigades, and while marching to the assigned position, his men came within sight of a Union signal station on Little Round Top. Countermarching to avoid detection wasted much time, and Hood's and McLaws's divisions did not launch their attacks until just after 4 p.m. and 5 p.m., respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Pfanz, ''Second Day'', pp. 119–23.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attacks on the Union left flank===
[[File:Gettysburg Battle Map Day2.png|thumb|350px|Overview map of the second day of the Battle of Gettysburg, July 2, 1863]]
As Longstreet's divisions slammed into the Union III Corps, Meade was forced to send 20,000 reinforcements&lt;ref&gt;Harman, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; in the form of the entire V Corps, Brig. Gen. [[John C. Caldwell]]'s division of the II Corps, most of the XII Corps, and small portions of the newly arrived VI Corps. The Confederate assault deviated from Lee's plan since Hood's division moved more easterly than intended, losing its alignment with the Emmitsburg Road,&lt;ref&gt;Harman, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; attacking Devil's Den and Little Round Top. McLaws, coming in on Hood's left, drove multiple attacks into the thinly stretched III Corps in the [[Battle of Gettysburg, Second Day#Wheatfield|Wheatfield]] and overwhelmed them in Sherfy's [[Battle of Gettysburg, Second Day#Peach Orchard|Peach Orchard]]. McLaws's attack eventually reached Plum Run Valley (the &quot;Valley of Death&quot;) before being beaten back by the [[Pennsylvania Reserves]] division of the V Corps, moving down from Little Round Top. The III Corps was virtually destroyed as a combat unit in this battle, and Sickles's leg was amputated after it was shattered by a cannonball. Caldwell's division was destroyed piecemeal in the Wheatfield. Anderson's division, coming from McLaws's left and starting forward around 6 p.m., reached the crest of Cemetery Ridge, but it could not hold the position in the face of counterattacks from the II Corps, including an almost suicidal bayonet charge by the small [[1st Minnesota Volunteer Infantry|1st Minnesota]] regiment against a Confederate brigade, ordered in desperation by Hancock to buy time for reinforcements to arrive.&lt;ref&gt;Sears, pp. 312–24; Eicher, pp. 530–35; Coddington, p. 423.&lt;/ref&gt;

As fighting raged in the Wheatfield and Devil's Den, Col. [[Strong Vincent]] of V Corps had a precarious hold on Little Round Top, an important hill at the extreme left of the Union line. His brigade of four relatively small regiments was able to resist repeated assaults by Brig. Gen. [[Evander M. Law]]'s brigade of Hood's division. Meade's chief engineer, Brig. Gen. [[Gouverneur K. Warren]], had realized the importance of this position, and dispatched Vincent's brigade, an artillery battery, and the 140th New York to occupy Little Round Top mere minutes before Hood's troops arrived. The defense of Little Round Top with a bayonet charge by the [[20th Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment|20th Maine]] was one of the most fabled episodes in the Civil War and propelled Col. [[Joshua L. Chamberlain]] into prominence after the war.&lt;ref&gt;Eicher, pp. 527–30; Clark, pp. 81–85.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attacks on the Union right flank===
[[File:Union breastworks Culp's Hill Gettysburg.jpg|thumb|left|Union [[breastworks]] on Culp's Hill]]
About 7:00 p.m., the Second Corps' attack by Johnson's division on Culp's Hill got off to a late start. Most of the hill's defenders, the Union XII Corps, had been sent to the left to defend against Longstreet's attacks, and the only portion of the corps remaining on the hill was a brigade of New Yorkers under Brig. Gen. [[George S. Greene]]. Because of Greene's insistence on constructing strong defensive works, and with reinforcements from the I and XI Corps, Greene's men held off the Confederate attackers, although the Southerners did capture a portion of the abandoned Federal works on the lower part of Culp's Hill.&lt;ref&gt;Eicher, pp. 537–38; Sauers, p. 835; Pfanz, ''Culp's Hill'', pp. 205–34; Clark, pp. 115–16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Just at dark, two of Jubal Early's brigades attacked the Union XI Corps positions on East Cemetery Hill where Col. [[Andrew L. Harris]] of the 2nd Brigade, 1st Division, came under a withering attack, losing half his men; however, Early failed to support his brigades in their attack, and Ewell's remaining division, that of Maj. Gen. [[Robert E. Rodes]], failed to aid Early's attack by moving against Cemetery Hill from the west. The Union army's interior lines enabled its commanders to shift troops quickly to critical areas, and with reinforcements from II Corps, the Federal troops retained possession of East Cemetery Hill, and Early's brigades were forced to withdraw.&lt;ref&gt;Pfanz, ''Culp's Hill'', pp. 235–83; Clark, pp. 116–18; Eicher, pp. 538–39.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jeb Stuart]] and his three cavalry brigades arrived in Gettysburg around noon but had no role in the second day's battle. Brig. Gen. [[Wade Hampton III|Wade Hampton]]'s brigade fought a minor engagement with newly promoted 23-year-old Brig. Gen. [[George Armstrong Custer]]'s [[Michigan]] cavalry near [[Battle of Hunterstown|Hunterstown]] to the northeast of Gettysburg.&lt;ref&gt;Sears, p. 257; Longacre, pp. 198–99.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Third day of battle==

[[File:Gettysburg Battle Map Day3.png|thumb|right|350px|Overview map of the third day of the Battle of Gettysburg, July 3, 1863]]

General Lee wished to renew the attack on Friday, July 3, using the same basic plan as the previous day: Longstreet would attack the Federal left, while Ewell attacked Culp's Hill.&lt;ref&gt;Harman, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; However, before Longstreet was ready, Union XII Corps troops started a dawn artillery bombardment against the Confederates on Culp's Hill in an effort to regain a portion of their lost works. The Confederates attacked, and the second fight for Culp's Hill ended around 11 a.m., after some seven hours of bitter combat.&lt;ref&gt;Pfanz, ''Culp's Hill'', pp. 284–352; Eicher, pp. 540–41; Coddington, pp. 465–75.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lee was forced to change his plans. Longstreet would command Pickett's Virginia division of his own First Corps, plus six brigades from Hill's Corps, in an attack on the Federal II Corps position at the right center of the Union line on Cemetery Ridge. Prior to the attack, all the artillery the Confederacy could bring to bear on the Federal positions would bombard and weaken the enemy's line.&lt;ref&gt;Eicher, p. 542; Coddington, pp. 485–86.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:High Water Mark - Cemetery Ridge, Gettysburg Battlefield.jpg|thumb|left|The &quot;High Water Mark&quot; on Cemetery Ridge as it appears today. The monument to the 72nd Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry Regiment (&quot;Baxter's Philadelphia Fire Zouaves&quot;) appears at right, the Copse of Trees to the left.]]
Around 1 p.m., from 150 to 170 Confederate guns&lt;ref&gt;See discussion of varying gun estimates in [[Pickett's Charge]] article footnote.&lt;/ref&gt; began an artillery bombardment that was probably the largest of the war. In order to save valuable ammunition for the infantry attack that they knew would follow, the Army of the Potomac's artillery, under the command of Brig. Gen. [[Henry Jackson Hunt]], at first did not return the enemy's fire. After waiting about 15 minutes, about 80 Federal cannons added to the din. The Army of Northern Virginia was critically low on artillery ammunition, and the cannonade did not significantly affect the Union position. Around 3 p.m., the cannon fire subsided, and 12,500 Southern soldiers stepped from the ridgeline and advanced the three-quarters of a mile (1,200 m) to Cemetery Ridge in what is known to history as &quot;[[Pickett's Charge]]&quot;. As the Confederates approached, there was fierce flanking artillery fire from Union positions on Cemetery Hill and north of Little Round Top, and musket and canister fire from Hancock's II Corps. In the Union center, the commander of artillery had held fire during the Confederate bombardment, leading Southern commanders to believe the Northern cannon batteries had been knocked out. However, they opened fire on the Confederate infantry during their approach with devastating results. Nearly one half of the attackers did not return to their own lines. Although the Federal line wavered and broke temporarily at a jog called the &quot;Angle&quot; in a low stone fence, just north of a patch of vegetation called the Copse of Trees, reinforcements rushed into the breach, and the Confederate attack was repulsed. The farthest advance of Brig. Gen. [[Lewis A. Armistead]]'s brigade of Maj. Gen. [[George Pickett]]'s division at the Angle is referred to as the &quot;[[High-water mark of the Confederacy]]&quot;, arguably representing the closest the South ever came to its goal of achieving independence from the Union via military victory.&lt;ref&gt;McPherson, pp. 661–63; Clark, pp. 133–44; Symonds, pp. 214–41; Eicher, pp. 543–49.&lt;/ref&gt;

There were two significant cavalry engagements on July 3. Stuart was sent to guard the Confederate left flank and was to be prepared to exploit any success the infantry might achieve on Cemetery Hill by flanking the Federal right and hitting their trains and lines of communications. Three miles (5&amp;nbsp;km) east of Gettysburg, in what is now called &quot;East Cavalry Field&quot; (not shown on the accompanying map, but between the York and Hanover Roads), Stuart's forces collided with Federal cavalry: Brig. Gen. [[David McMurtrie Gregg]]'s division and Brig. Gen. Custer's brigade. A lengthy mounted battle, including hand-to-hand sabre combat, ensued. Custer's charge, leading the 1st Michigan Cavalry, blunted the attack by [[Wade Hampton III|Wade Hampton's]] brigade, blocking Stuart from achieving his objectives in the Federal rear. Meanwhile, after hearing news of the day's victory, Brig. Gen. [[Judson Kilpatrick]] launched a cavalry attack against the infantry positions of Longstreet's Corps southwest of [[Big Round Top]]. Brig. Gen. [[Elon J. Farnsworth]] protested against the futility of such a move but obeyed orders. Farnsworth was killed in the attack, and his brigade suffered significant losses.&lt;ref&gt;Eicher, pp. 549–50; Longacre, pp. 226–31, 240-44; Sauers, p. 836; Wert, pp. 272–80.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
===Casualties===
[[File:Battle of Gettysburg.jpg|thumb|&quot;The Harvest of Death&quot;: Union dead on the battlefield at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, photographed July 5 or July 6, 1863, by [[Timothy H. O'Sullivan]].]]
The two armies suffered between 46,000 and 51,000 casualties. Union casualties were 23,055 (3,155 killed, 14,531 wounded, 5,369 captured or missing),&lt;ref name=Ucasualties/&gt; while Confederate casualties are more difficult to estimate. Many authors have referred to as many as 28,000 overall casualties,&lt;ref&gt;Examples of the varying Confederate casualties for July 1&amp;ndash;3 are Sears, p. 498 (22,625); Coddington, p. 536 (20,451, &quot;and very likely more&quot;); Trudeau, p. 529 (22,874); Eicher, p. 550 (22,874, &quot;but probably actually totaled 28,000 or more&quot;); McPherson, p. 664 (28,000); Esposito, map 99 (&quot;near 28,000&quot;); Clark, p. 150 (20,448, &quot;but probably closer to 28,000,&quot; which he inaccurately cites as a nearly 40% loss); Woodworth, p. 209 (&quot;at least equal to Meade's and possibly as high as 28,000&quot;); [http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/pa002.htm NPS] (28,000).&lt;/ref&gt; but Busey and Martin's more recent definitive 2005 work, ''Regimental Strengths and Losses'', documents 23,231 (4,708 killed, 12,693 wounded, 5,830 captured or missing).&lt;ref name=Ccasualties/&gt; Nearly a third of Lee's general officers were killed, wounded, or captured.&lt;ref&gt;Glatthaar, p. 282.&lt;/ref&gt; The casualties for both sides during the entire campaign were 57,225.&lt;ref&gt;Sears, p. 513.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bruce Catton]] wrote, &quot;The town of Gettysburg looked as if some universal moving day had been interrupted by catastrophe.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Catton, p. 325.&lt;/ref&gt; But there was only one documented civilian death during the battle: [[Ginnie Wade]] (also widely known as Jennie), 20 years old, was hit by a stray bullet that passed through her kitchen in town while she was making bread.&lt;ref&gt;Sears, p. 391.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nearly 8,000 had been killed outright; these bodies, lying in the hot summer sun, needed to be buried quickly. Over 3,000 horse carcasses&lt;ref&gt;Sears, p. 511.&lt;/ref&gt; were burned in a series of piles south of town; townsfolk became violently ill from the stench.&lt;ref&gt;Woodworth, p. 216.&lt;/ref&gt;

The following tables summarize casualties by corps for the Union and Confederate forces during the three day battle.&lt;ref&gt;Busey and Martin, pp. 125-47, 260-315. Headquarters element casualties account for the minor differences in army totals stated previously.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Confederate retreat===
{{Further|[[Retreat from Gettysburg]]}}
[[File:Gettysburg Campaign Retreat.png|thumb|350px|Gettysburg Campaign (July 5&amp;nbsp;– July 14, 1863).]]
The armies stared at one another in a heavy rain across the bloody fields on July 4, the same day that the [[Battle of Vicksburg|Vicksburg]] garrison surrendered to Maj. Gen. [[Ulysses S. Grant]]. Lee had reformed his lines into a defensive position on Seminary Ridge the night of July 3, evacuating the town of Gettysburg. The Confederates remained on the battlefield, hoping that Meade would attack, but the cautious Union commander decided against the risk, a decision for which he would later be criticized. Both armies began to collect their remaining wounded and bury some of the dead. A proposal by Lee for a prisoner exchange was rejected by Meade.&lt;ref&gt;Eicher, p. 550; Coddington, pp. 539–44; Clark, pp. 146–47; Sears, p. 469; Wert, p. 300.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lee started his Army of Northern Virginia in motion late the evening of July 4 towards [[Fairfield, Pennsylvania|Fairfield]] and Chambersburg. Cavalry under Brig. Gen. [[John D. Imboden]] was entrusted to escort the miles-long wagon train of supplies and wounded men that Lee wanted to take back to Virginia with him, using the route through Cashtown and Hagerstown to [[Williamsport, Maryland]]. Meade's army followed, although the pursuit was half-spirited. The recently rain-swollen Potomac trapped Lee's army on the north bank of the river for a time, but when the Federals finally caught up, the Confederates had forded the river. The [[Battle of Williamsport|rear-guard action at Falling Waters]] on July 14 added some more names to the long casualty lists, including General Pettigrew, who was mortally wounded.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, pp. 147–57; Longacre, pp. 268–69.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a brief letter to Maj. Gen. Henry W. Halleck written on July 7, Lincoln remarked on the two major Union victories at Gettysburg and Vicksburg. He continued:

{{Quote|Now, if Gen. Meade can complete his work so gloriously prosecuted thus far, by the literal or substantial destruction of Lee's army, the rebellion will be over.&lt;ref&gt;Coddington, p. 564.&lt;/ref&gt;}} 

Halleck then relayed the contents of Lincoln's letter to Meade in a telegram. Despite repeated pleas from Lincoln and Halleck, which continued over the next week, Meade did not pursue Lee's army aggressively enough to destroy it before it crossed back over the Potomac River to safety in the South. The campaign continued into Virginia with light engagements until July 23, in the minor [[Battle of Manassas Gap]], after which Meade abandoned any attempts at pursuit and the two armies took up positions across from each other on the [[Rappahannock River]].&lt;ref&gt;Coddington, pp. 535–74; Sears, pp. 496–97; Eicher, p. 596; Wittenberg et al., ''One Continuous Fight'', pp. 345–46..&lt;/ref&gt;

===Union reaction to the news of the victory===
The news of the Union victory electrified the North. A headline in ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' proclaimed &quot;VICTORY! [[Battle of Waterloo|WATERLOO]] ECLIPSED!&quot; New York diarist [[George Templeton Strong]] wrote:&lt;ref&gt;McPherson, p. 664.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|The results of this victory are priceless. ... The charm of Robert E. Lee's invincibility is broken. The Army of the Potomac has at last found a general that can handle it, and has stood nobly up to its terrible work in spite of its long disheartening list of hard-fought failures. ... [[Copperheads (politics)|Copperheads]] are palsied and dumb for the moment at least. ... Government is strengthened four-fold at home and abroad.|George Templeton Strong|Diary, p. 330.}}

However, the Union enthusiasm soon dissipated as the public realized that Lee's army had escaped destruction and the war would continue. Lincoln complained to Secretary of the Navy [[Gideon Welles]] that &quot;Our army held the war in the hollow of their hand and they would not close it!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Donald, p. 446; Woodworth, p. 217.&lt;/ref&gt; Brig. Gen. [[Alexander S. Webb]] wrote to his father on July 17, stating that such Washington politicians as &quot;[[Salmon P. Chase|Chase]], [[William H. Seward|Seward]] and others,&quot; disgusted with Meade, &quot;write to me that Lee really won that Battle!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Coddington, p. 573.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effect on the Confederacy===
The Confederates had lost politically as well as militarily. During the final hours of the battle, Confederate Vice President [[Alexander Stephens]] was approaching the Union lines at [[Norfolk, Virginia]], under a [[White flag|flag of truce]]. Although his formal instructions from [[President of the Confederate States|Confederate President]] [[Jefferson Davis]] had limited his powers to negotiations on prisoner exchanges and other procedural matters, historian [[James M. McPherson]] speculates that he had informal goals of presenting peace overtures. Davis had hoped that Stephens would reach Washington from the south while Lee's victorious army was marching toward it from the north. President Lincoln, upon hearing of the Gettysburg results, refused Stephens's request to pass through the lines. Furthermore, when the news reached London, any lingering hopes of European recognition of the Confederacy were finally abandoned. [[Henry Brooks Adams|Henry Adams]] wrote, &quot;The disasters of the rebels are unredeemed by even any hope of success. It is now conceded that all idea of intervention is at an end.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;McPherson, pp. 650, 664.&lt;/ref&gt;

The immediate reaction of the Southern military and public sectors was that Gettysburg was a setback, not a disaster. The sentiment was that Lee had been successful on July 1 and had fought a valiant battle on July 2&amp;ndash;3, but could not dislodge the Union Army from the strong defensive position to which it fled. The Confederates successfully stood their ground on July 4 and withdrew only after they realized Meade would not attack them. The withdrawal to the Potomac that could have been a disaster was handled masterfully. Furthermore, the Army of the Potomac had been kept away from Virginia farmlands for the summer and all predicted that Meade would be too timid to threaten them for the rest of the year. Lee himself had a positive view of the campaign, writing to his wife that the army had returned &quot;rather sooner than I had originally contemplated, but having accomplished what I proposed on leaving the Rappahannock, viz., relieving the Valley of the presence of the enemy and drawing his Army north of the Potomac.&quot; He was quoted as saying to Maj. John Seddon, brother of the Confederate secretary of war, &quot;Sir, we did whip them at Gettysburg, and it will be seen for the next six months that ''that army'' will be as quiet as a sucking dove.&quot; Some Southern publications, such as the ''Charleston Mercury'', criticized Lee's actions in the campaign and on August 8 he offered his resignation to President Davis, who quickly rejected it.&lt;ref&gt;Gallagher, ''Lee and His Army'', pp. 86, 93, 102-05; Sears, pp. 501–02; McPherson, p. 665, in contrast to Gallagher, depicts Lee as &quot;profoundly depressed&quot; about the battle.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gettysburg became a postbellum focus of the [[Lost Cause of the Confederacy|&quot;Lost Cause&quot;]], a movement by writers such as Edward A. Pollard and Jubal Early to explain the reasons for the Confederate defeat in the war. A fundamental premise of their argument was that the South was doomed because of the overwhelming advantage in manpower and industrial might possessed by the North. However, they claim it also suffered because Robert E. Lee, who up until this time had been almost invincible, was betrayed by the failures of some of his key subordinates at Gettysburg: Ewell, for failing to seize Cemetery Hill on July 1; Stuart, for depriving the army of cavalry intelligence for a key part of the campaign; and especially Longstreet, for failing to attack on July 2 as early and as forcefully as Lee had originally intended. In this view, Gettysburg was seen as a great lost opportunity, in which a decisive victory by Lee could have meant the end of the war in the Confederacy's favor.&lt;ref&gt;Gallagher, ''Lee and His Generals'', pp. 207–08; Sears, p. 503; Woodworth, p. 221. Gallagher's essay &quot;Jubal A. Early, The Lost Cause, and Civil War History: A Persistent Legacy&quot; in ''Lee and His Generals'' is a good overview of the Lost Cause movement.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gettysburg Address===
[[File:Gettysburg national cemetery img 4164.jpg|thumb|right|[[Gettysburg National Cemetery]]]]
The ravages of war were still evident in Gettysburg more than four months later when, on November 19, the [[Soldiers' National Cemetery]] was dedicated. During this ceremony, President [[Abraham Lincoln]] honored the fallen and redefined the purpose of the war in his historic [[Gettysburg Address]].&lt;ref&gt;White, p. 251. White refers to Lincoln's use of the term &quot;new birth of freedom&quot; and writes, &quot;The ''new birth'' that slowly emerged in Lincoln's politics meant that on November 19 at Gettysburg he was no longer, as in his inaugural address, defending an old Union but proclaiming a new Union. The old Union contained and attempted to restrain slavery. The new Union would fulfill the promise of liberty, the crucial step into the future that the Founders had failed to take.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the [[Gettysburg National Cemetery]] and [[Gettysburg Battlefield|Gettysburg National Military Park]] are maintained by the [[U.S. National Park Service]] as two of the nation's most revered historical landmarks.

==Historical assessment==
===Decisive victory? {{anchor|decisive}}===
The nature of the result of the Battle of Gettysburg has been the subject of controversy for years. Although not seen as overwhelmingly significant at the time, particularly since the war continued for almost two years, in retrospect it has often been cited as the [[Turning point of the American Civil War|&quot;turning point&quot;]], usually in combination with the fall of Vicksburg the following day.&lt;ref name=TP/&gt; This is based on the hindsight that, after Gettysburg, Lee's army conducted no more strategic offensives&amp;mdash;his army merely reacted to the initiative of [[Ulysses S. Grant]] in 1864 and 1865&amp;mdash;and by the speculative viewpoint of the Lost Cause writers that a Confederate victory at Gettysburg might have resulted in the end of the war.&lt;ref&gt;McPherson, p. 665; Gallagher, ''Lee and His Generals'', pp. 207–08.&lt;/ref&gt;

}}
It is currently a widely held view that Gettysburg was a [[decisive victory]] for the Union, but the term is imprecise. It is inarguable that Lee's offensive on July 3 was turned back decisively and his campaign in Pennsylvania was terminated prematurely (although the Confederates at the time argued that this was a temporary setback and that the goals of the campaign were largely met). However, when the more common definition of &quot;decisive victory&quot; is intended&amp;mdash;an indisputable military victory of a battle that determines or significantly influences the ultimate result of a conflict&amp;mdash;historians are divided. For example, [[David J. Eicher]] called Gettysburg a &quot;strategic loss for the Confederacy&quot; and [[James M. McPherson]] wrote that &quot;Lee and his men would go on to earn further laurels. But they never again possessed the power and reputation they carried into Pennsylvania those palmy summer days of 1863.&quot; However, Herman Hattaway and Archer Jones wrote that the &quot;strategic impact of the Battle of Gettysburg was ... fairly limited.&quot; Steven E. Woodworth wrote that &quot;Gettysburg proved only the near impossibility of decisive action in the Eastern theater.&quot; Edwin Coddington pointed out the heavy toll on the Army of the Potomac and that &quot;after the battle Meade no longer possessed a truly effective instrument for the accomplishments of his task. The army needed a thorough reorganization with new commanders and fresh troops, but these changes were not made until Grant appeared on the scene in March 1864.&quot; Joseph T. Glatthaar wrote that &quot;Lost opportunities and near successes plagued the Army of Northern Virginia during its Northern invasion,&quot; yet after Gettysburg, &quot;without the distractions of duty as an invading force, without the breakdown of discipline, the Army of Northern Virginia [remained] an extremely formidable force.&quot; [[Ed Bearss]] wrote, &quot;Lee's invasion of the North had been a costly failure. Nevertheless, at best the Army of the Potomac had simply preserved the strategic stalemate in the Eastern Theater ...&quot; Peter Carmichael refers to the &quot;horrendous losses at Chancellorsville and Gettysburg, which effectively destroyed Lee's offensive capacity,&quot; implying that these cumulative losses were not the result of a single battle. Thomas Goss, writing in the U.S. Army's ''Military Review'' journal on the definition of &quot;decisive&quot; and the application of that description to Gettysburg, concludes: &quot;For all that was decided and accomplished, the Battle of Gettysburg fails to earn the label 'decisive battle'.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Eicher, p. 550; McPherson, p. 665; Hattaway and Jones, p. 415; Woodworth, p. xiii; Coddington, p. 573; Glatthaar, p. 288; Bearss, p. 202; Carmichael, p. xvii; {{cite journal|last=Goss|first=Major Thomas|date=July–August 2004|title=Gettysburg's &quot;Decisive Battle&quot;|journal=Military Review|pages=11–16|url=http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/milreview/goss.pdf|accessdate=November 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lee vs. Meade===
Prior to Gettysburg, Robert E. Lee had established a reputation as an almost invincible general, achieving stunning victories against superior numbers&amp;mdash;although usually at the cost of high casualties to his army&amp;mdash;during the [[Seven Days Battles|Seven Days]], the [[Northern Virginia Campaign]] (including the [[Second Battle of Bull Run]]), [[Battle of Fredericksburg|Fredericksburg]], and [[Battle of Chancellorsville|Chancellorsville]]. Only the [[Maryland Campaign]], with its tactically inconclusive [[Battle of Antietam]], had been less than successful. Therefore, historians have attempted to explain how Lee's winning streak was interrupted so dramatically at Gettysburg. Although the issue is tainted by attempts to portray history and Lee's reputation in a manner supporting different partisan goals, the major factors in Lee's loss arguably can be attributed to: (1) Lee's overconfidence in the invincibility of his men; (2) the performance of his subordinates, and his management thereof; (3) health issues, and; (4) the performance of his opponent, George G. Meade, and the Army of the Potomac.

Throughout the campaign, Lee was influenced by the belief that his men were invincible; most of Lee's experiences with the Army of Northern Virginia had convinced him of this, including the great victory at Chancellorsville in early May and the rout of the Union troops at Gettysburg on July 1. Since morale plays an important role in military victory when other factors are equal, Lee did not want to dampen his army's desire to fight and resisted suggestions, principally by Longstreet, to withdraw from the recently captured Gettysburg to select a ground more favorable to his army. War correspondent Peter W. Alexander wrote that Lee &quot;acted, probably, under the impression that his troops were able to carry any position however formidable. If such was the case, he committed an error, such however as the ablest commanders will sometimes fall into.&quot; Lee himself concurred with this judgment, writing to President Davis, &quot;No blame can be attached to the army for its failure to accomplish what was projected by me, nor should it be censured for the unreasonable expectations of the public&amp;mdash;I am alone to blame, in perhaps expecting too much of its prowess and valor.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Sears, pp. 499–500; Glatthaar, p. 287; Fuller, p. 198, states that Lee's &quot;overweening confidence in the superiority of his soldiers over his enemy possessed him.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

The most controversial assessments of the battle involve the performance of Lee's subordinates. The dominant theme of the Lost Cause writers and many other historians is that Lee's senior generals failed him in crucial ways, directly causing the loss of the battle; the alternative viewpoint is that Lee did not manage his subordinates adequately, and did not thereby compensate for their shortcomings.&lt;ref&gt;For example, Sears, p. 504: &quot;In the final analysis, it was Robert E. Lee's inability to manage his generals that went to the heart of the failed campaign.&quot; Glatthaar, pp. 285–86, criticizes the inability of the generals to coordinate their actions as a whole. Fuller, p. 198, states that Lee &quot;maintained no grip over the operations&quot; of his army.&lt;/ref&gt; Two of his corps commanders&amp;mdash;[[Richard S. Ewell]] and [[A.P. Hill]]&amp;mdash;had only recently been promoted and were not fully accustomed to Lee's style of command, in which he provided only general objectives and guidance to their former commander, [[Stonewall Jackson]]; Jackson translated these into detailed, specific orders to his division commanders.&lt;ref&gt;Fuller, p. 195, for example, refers to orders to Stuart that &quot;were as usual vague.&quot; Fuller, p. 197, wrote &quot;As was [Lee's] custom, he relied on verbal instructions, and left all details to his subordinates.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; All four of Lee's principal commanders received criticism during the campaign and battle:&lt;ref&gt;Woodworth, pp. 209–10.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[James Longstreet]] suffered most severely from the wrath of the Lost Cause authors, not the least because he directly criticized Lee in postbellum writings and became a [[History of the Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] after the war. His critics accuse him of attacking much later than Lee intended on July 2, squandering a chance to hit the Union Army before its defensive positions had firmed up. They also question his lack of motivation to attack strongly on July 2 and July 3 because he had argued that the army should have maneuvered to a place where it would force Meade to attack them. The alternative view is that Lee was in close contact with Longstreet during the battle, agreed to delays on the morning of July 2, and never criticized Longstreet's performance. (There is also considerable speculation about what an attack might have looked like before Dan Sickles moved the III Corps toward the Peach Orchard.)&lt;ref&gt;Sears, pp. 501–02; McPherson, pp. 656–57; Coddington, pp. 375–80; A more detailed collection of historical assessments of Longstreet at Gettysburg may be found in [[James Longstreet#Gettysburg]].&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[J.E.B. Stuart]] deprived Lee of cavalry intelligence during a good part of the campaign by taking his three best brigades on a path away from the army's. This arguably led to Lee's surprise at Hooker's vigorous pursuit; the meeting engagement on July 1 that escalated into the full battle prematurely; and it also prevented Lee from understanding the full disposition of the enemy on July 2. The disagreements regarding Stuart's culpability for the situation center around the relatively vague orders issued by Lee, but most modern historians agree that both generals were responsible to some extent for the failure of the cavalry's mission early in the campaign.&lt;ref&gt;Sears, p. 502; A more detailed collection of historical assessments of Stuart in the Gettysburg Campaign may be found in [[J.E.B. Stuart#Gettysburg]].&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Richard S. Ewell]] has been universally criticized for failing to seize the high ground on the afternoon of July 1. Once again the disagreement centers on Lee's orders, which provided general guidance for Ewell to act &quot;if practicable.&quot; Many historians speculate that Stonewall Jackson, if he had survived Chancellorsville, would have aggressively seized Culp's Hill, rendering Cemetery Hill indefensible, and changing the entire complexion of the battle. A differently worded order from Lee may have made the difference with this subordinate.&lt;ref&gt;McPherson, p. 654; Coddington, pp. 317–19; Eicher, pp. 517–18; Sears, p. 503.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[A.P. Hill]] has received some criticism for his ineffective performance. His actions caused the battle to begin and then escalate on July 1, despite Lee's orders not to bring on a general engagement (although historians point out that Hill kept Lee well informed of his actions during the day). However, illness minimized his personal involvement in the remainder of the battle, and Lee took the explicit step of removing troops from Hill's corps and giving them to Longstreet for [[Pickett's Charge]].&lt;ref&gt;Sears, pp. 502–03.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to Hill's illness, Lee's performance was affected by his own illness, which has been speculated as chest pains due to [[angina pectoris|angina]]. He wrote to Jefferson Davis that his physical condition prevented him from offering full supervision in the field, and said, &quot;I am so dull that in making use of the eyes of others I am frequently misled.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Sears, p. 500.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a final factor, Lee faced a new and formidable opponent in [[George G. Meade]], and the Army of the Potomac fought well on its home territory. Although new to his army command, Meade deployed his forces relatively effectively; relied on strong subordinates such as [[Winfield S. Hancock]] to make decisions where and when they were needed; took great advantage of defensive positions; nimbly shifted defensive resources on interior lines to parry strong threats; and, unlike some of his predecessors, stood his ground throughout the battle in the face of fierce Confederate attacks. Lee was quoted before the battle as saying Meade &quot;would commit no blunders on my front and if I make one ... will make haste to take advantage of it.&quot; That prediction proved to be correct at Gettysburg. Stephen Sears wrote, &quot;The fact of the matter is that George G. Meade, unexpectedly and against all odds, thoroughly outgeneraled Robert E. Lee at Gettysburg.&quot; Edwin B. Coddington wrote that the soldiers of the Army of the Potomac received a &quot;sense of triumph which grew into an imperishable faith in [themselves]. The men knew what they could do under an extremely competent general; one of lesser ability and courage could well have lost the battle.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Sears, p. 506; Coddington, p. 573.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meade had his own detractors as well. Similar to the situation with Lee, Meade suffered partisan attacks about his performance at Gettysburg, but he had the misfortune of experiencing them in person. Supporters of his predecessor, Maj. Gen. [[Joseph Hooker]], lambasted Meade before the [[U.S. Congress]]'s [[Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War]], where [[Radical Republicans]] suspected that Meade was a [[Copperheads (politics)|Copperhead]] and tried in vain to relieve him from command. [[Daniel E. Sickles]] and [[Daniel Butterfield]] accused Meade of planning to retreat from Gettysburg during the battle. Most politicians, including Lincoln, criticized Meade for what they considered to be his tepid pursuit of Lee after the battle. A number of Meade's most competent subordinates&amp;mdash;[[Winfield S. Hancock]], [[John Gibbon]], [[Gouverneur K. Warren]], and [[Henry J. Hunt]], all heroes of the battle&amp;mdash;defended Meade in print, but Meade was embittered by the overall experience.&lt;ref&gt;Sears, pp. 505–07.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commemoration in U.S. postage and currency==

During the [[American Civil War Centennial|Civil War Centennial]], the U.S. Post Office issued five postage stamps commemorating the 100th anniversaries of famous battles, as they occurred over a four-year period, beginning with the [[Battle of Fort Sumter]] Centennial issue of 1961. The [[Battle of Shiloh]] commemorative stamp was issued in 1962, the Battle of Gettysburg in 1963, the [[Battle of the Wilderness]] in 1964, and the [[Battle of Appomattox Court House|Appomattox]] Centennial commemorative stamp in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arago.si.edu/index.asp?con=1&amp;cmd=1&amp;mode=&amp;tid=2038859 Smithsonian National Postal Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 24, 2011, the [[America the Beautiful quarters]] program will introduce a 25-cent coin commemorating Gettysburg National Military Park and the Battle of Gettysburg. The reverse side of the coin depicts the monument on Cemetery Ridge to the 72nd Pennsylvania Infantry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usmint.gov/mint_programs/atb/?local=gettysburg U.S. Mint America the Beautiful Quarters Program website]&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular media==
The Battle of Gettysburg was depicted in the 1993 movie, [[Gettysburg (film)|''Gettysburg'']], based on [[Michael Shaara]]'s 1974 novel ''[[The Killer Angels]]''. The movie and novel focused primarily on the actions of [[Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain]], [[John Buford]], [[Robert E. Lee]], and [[James Longstreet]] during the battle. The first day focused on Buford's cavalry defense, the second day on Chamberlain's defense at [[Little Round Top]], and the third day on [[Pickett's Charge]].

In the 2004 [[mockumentary]] ''[[C.S.A.: The Confederate States of America]]'', the Battle of Gettysburg is won by the Confederate forces as a result of politician [[Judah P. Benjamin]] successfully convincing the [[United Kingdom]] and [[France]] to aid the Confederacy. This causes a [[butterfly effect]] that sees the Confederacy win the Civil War and subsequently conquer all of North and South America except [[Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csathemovie.com/timeline/ Confederate Legacy Presents C.S.A.: A Historical Timeline]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Budweiser''''' ({{IPA-en|ˈbʌdwaɪzər|pron}}) is a 5.0% [[abv]] [[American-style lager]] introduced in 1876 by [[Adolphus Busch]] and one of the highest selling beers in the United States. It is made with up to 30% rice in addition to [[hops]] and [[barley]] [[malt]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Protz-CgtwBeer&quot;&gt;Protz, R., ''The Complete Guide to World Beer'' (2004), ISBN 1844428656&lt;/ref&gt; ''Budweiser'' is produced in various [[brewery|breweries]] located around the United States and the rest of the world. It is a [[filtered beer]] available in [[draught beer|draught]] and packaged forms.

==Name origin and dispute==
{{Main|Budweiser trademark dispute}}
In 1876, [[Adolphus Busch]] and his friend Carl Conrad, a liquor importer, developed a &quot;Bohemian-style&quot; lager, inspired after a trip to the region. Brewers in [[Bohemia]] (today's Czech Republic) generally named a beer after their town with the suffix &quot;er.&quot; Beers produced in the town of Pilsen (today's [[Plzeň]]), for example, were called [[Pilsner]]s. Busch and Conrad had visited another town, only 104&amp;nbsp;km (65 miles) south of Pilsen also, known for its breweries: Budweis (or Böhmisch Budweis, today's [[České Budějovice]]). Beer has been brewed in Budweis since it was founded as ''Budiwoyz'' by king [[Ottokar II of Bohemia]] in 1245. The name ''Budweiser'' is a locative, meaning &quot;of Budweis.&quot; In most European countries American ''Budweiser'' is not labelled as ''Budweiser'' but as ''Bud'', and the name ''Budweiser'' refers to the original Czech beer, [[Budweiser Budvar]], except for the United Kingdom, where both beers are sold as ''Budweiser''.

Anheuser-Busch has a market share in the United States of 50.9% for all beers sold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/stlouis/stories/2008/04/21/daily42.html |title=Anheuser-Busch reports rise in Q1 sales, slight drop in profit - St. Louis Business Journal |publisher=Bizjournals.com |date=April 23, 2008 |accessdate=September 30, 2010 |first=Matt |last=Allen}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is primarily composed of ''Budweiser'' brands. In 2008 Anheuser-Busch sold the majority of their stock to Belgian-Brazilian beer giant [[InBev]], to create the largest brewing company in the world.  The company's 2005 annual report cites figures showing ''Budweiser'' brands to be selling well in markets outside the U.S., including China,{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} and Canada, where [[Labatt Brewing Company]] brews and packages ''Budweiser'' and ''Bud Light'' for the Canadian market.

''Budweiser'' is widely available in Mexico due to Anheuser-Busch's half-ownership of [[Grupo Modelo]], through which ''Budweiser'' and ''Bud Light'' are distributed. In Ireland, ''Budweiser'' is brewed, marketed, and sold by [[Guinness]]. ''Budweiser'' is also available in Australia, Italy, UK, Brazil, Argentina, Finland, Germany, Spain, [[Panama]], [[Paraguay]], Japan, India and Russia because of partnerships Anheuser-Busch has with major brewers there.

''Budweiser'', under the name ''Bud'', is also available in Belgium and is imported by [[Corsendonk]] breweries and is distributed by [[Carrefour]], the second largest retailer in the world.

''Budweiser'' was recently launched in India, where it is slowly gaining market share from the leading [[Kingfisher (beer)|Kingfisher]], [[Foster's Lager|Fosters]] and [[Royal Challenge]].

''Budweiser'' is also available in [[Jordan]] and [[Lebanon]]. It is not brewed there though, it is imported from the UK Budweiser Stag Brewing Company. Usually Budweiser is sold for higher prices in Jordan  than the more common [[Amstel_Brewery|Amstel]] (500 ml '16 oz' Budweiser is 3.75 Jordanian Dinars, 5 US dollars, while Amstel sells for 2 dinars).

==Marketing==
[[Image:ClydeWithBlanket.jpg|right|thumb|One of the Budweiser Clydesdales]]
Anheuser-Busch uses what is in many jurisdictions a legally-protected mark-of-origin indicating Czech provenance and humorous [[advertising campaign]]s to promote ''Budweiser'', such as the &quot;[[Real Men of Genius]]&quot; radio and television commercials for ''Bud Light''.

The ''Budweiser'' from Budějovice has been called &quot;The Beer of Kings&quot; since the 16th century. Adolphus Busch changed this slogan to &quot;The King of the Beers&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamhof.org/bio1.html |title=GAMHOF Adolphus Busch Biography |publisher=GAMHOF - German-American Hall of Fame |year=2008 |accessdate=April 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Czech Budweiser is sold in some countries as ''Budejovicky Budvar'' but is known as ''Budweiser'' in many other countries throughout the world.

Some ''Bud'' advertising campaigns have entered the popular culture in the United States. They include a long line of TV advertisements in the 1990s featuring [[Budweiser Frogs|three frogs]] named &quot;Bud&quot;, &quot;Weis&quot;, and &quot;Er&quot;, the Budweiser Ants, and a campaign built around the phrase &quot;[[Whassup?]]&quot;. Anheuser-Busch is known for its sport [[sponsor (commercial)|sponsorship]], video game sponsorship ([[Tapper]]), and humorous advertisements. Advertising campaigns have also included lizards impersonating the &quot;Bud-weis-er&quot; frogs, and a team of [[Clydesdale horse]]s commonly known as the [[Budweiser Clydesdales]]. Commercials starred the infamous Brody Chillston, of ChillMilk.com fame.

[[Image:DaleEarnhardtJr.Texas2007.jpg|right|thumb|[[Dale Earnhardt, Jr.|Dale Earnhardt, Jr.'s]] Budweiser car in 2007]]

The ''Budweiser'' brand is promoted in motorsports, from [[Bernie Little]]'s [[Miss Budweiser]] hydroplane boat to sponsoring the Budweiser King Top Fuel Dragster driven by Brandon Bernstein. Anheuser-Busch has sponsored the [[Champ Car|CART]] championship, and top NASCAR teams such as [[Junior Johnson]], [[Hendrick Motorsports]] and [[Dale Earnhardt, Inc.|DEI]]. ''Budweiser'' is the official beer of [[NHRA]] and was the official beer of [[NASCAR]] until 2007. In 2008, Anheuser-Busch became [[Kasey Kahne]]'s primary sponsor, and has also sponsored many races, including the [[Budweiser Shootout]], and previously [[Centurion Boats at the Glen|The Bud at the Glen]], [[Budweiser 500]]{{dn}}, and [[Budweiser 400]]. In 2011, Budweiser became the sponsor for [[Kevin Harvick]].

Anheuser-Busch has placed ''Budweiser'' as an official partner and sponsor of [[Major League Soccer]] and [[Los Angeles Galaxy]] and was the headline sponsor of the [[British Basketball League]] in the 1990s, taking over from rival company [[Carlsberg Group|Carlsberg]]. Anheuser-Busch has also placed ''Budweiser'' as an official sponsor of the [[Premier League]].

In the early 20th century, the company commissioned a play-on-words song called ''[[Under the Anheuser Bush]]'', which was recorded by several early phonograph companies. Popular music continues to be used in advertisements for ''Budweiser''. Some commercials feature the song &quot;[[Galvanize (song)|Galvanize]]&quot;, by [[The Chemical Brothers]].

In August 2009 Anheuser-Busch partnered with popular Chinese [[video-sharing]] site, [[Tudou.com]] for a user-generated online video contest. The contest encourages users to suggest ideas that include ants for a Bud TV spot set to run in February 2010 during the [[Chinese New Year]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news |author=Madden, Normandy |title=Chinese Beer Consumers to Create the Next Budweiser Spot Through Online Contest |url=http://adage.com/globalnews/article?article_id=138666 |work=AdAge.com |date=August 26, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Containers and packaging==
===Containers===
Over the years, ''Budweiser'' has been distributed in many sizes and containers. Until the early 1950s ''Budweiser'' was primarily distributed in three packages: kegs, 12-ounce bottles and quart bottles. Cans were first introduced in 1936, but did not initially become popular.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anheuser-busch.com/our_company/history.html ]{{Dead link|date=March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1955 August Busch Jr.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9000617/August-Anheuser-Busch-Jr |title=August Anheuser Busch, Jr. - Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Britannica.com |date=September 29, 1989 |accessdate=September 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; made a strategic move to expand ''Budweiser'''s national brand and distributor presence. Along with this expansion came advances in bottling automation, new bottling materials and more efficient distribution methods. These advances brought to market many new containers and package designs. {{As of|2011}} ''Budweiser'' is distributed in four large container volumes: half-barrel (15.5 US gallons), quarter-barrel, 1/6 barrel and beer balls (5.2 gallons); and in smaller 7, 8, 10, 12, 16, 18, 22, 24, 32 and 40 US ounce containers. Smaller containers may be made of glass, aluminum or plastic.[[Image:A bottle of Budweiser.JPG|thumb|right|150px|Lone Star State Edition ''Budweiser'']]

Packages are sometimes tailored to local customs and traditions. In [[Maryland]],  ten ounce cans&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gazette.net/stories/111705/busipgl154036_31896.shtml |title=St. Mary’s celebrates 10-ounce beer |publisher=Gazette.net |date= |accessdate=September 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5336207 |title=Where the 10-Ounce Bud Is the King of Beers |publisher=NPR |date= |accessdate=September 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; are the preferred package. ''Budweiser'' drinkers in the western stretches of [[Ottawa County, Michigan]] prefer the eight ounce can. This Ottawa County preference for the eight ounce can may stem from a long-standing [[blue law]] held in many Western Michigan cities that prohibit sale of beer and wine on Sundays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wzzm13.com/news/news_article.aspx?storyid=72652 |title=Grand Rapids, MI &amp;#124; Sunday liquor sales in Holland begin |publisher=wzzm13.com |date= |accessdate=September 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wzzm13.com/news/news_article.aspx?storyid=50180 |title=Grand Rapids, MI &amp;#124; Zeeland Considers Alcohol Sales |publisher=wzzm13.com |date=February 6, 2006 |accessdate=September 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to this blue law, brewers and distributors presented the eight ounce can as a smaller alternative.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

Anheuser-Busch has introduced many can designs with co-branding and sports marketing promotional packaging. Today, most of these promotional programs are represented only on the 16 ounce aluminum bottle container. However, many major league baseball and NFL teams also promote 24 ounce cans marked with team logos.

The ''Budweiser'' bottle has remained relatively unchanged since its introduction in 1876. The top label is red and currently reads &quot;Budweiser&quot;. The top of the main label is red with a white banner with a [[Oath|pledge]] on it, which has changed three times. Below the banner is a [[coat of arms]] of sorts, which features an Anheuser-Busch stylization. Below that is a large white box.

== Beer ==
''Budweiser'' is brewed using [[barley]] malt, rice, water, [[hops]] and [[yeast]]. It is lagered with [[beech]]wood chips in the ageing vessel which, according to Anheuser-Busch, creates a smoother taste.  While beechwood chips are used in the maturation tank, there is little to no flavor contribution from the wood, mainly because they are boiled in [[sodium bicarbonate]] [baking soda] for seven hours for the very purpose of removing any flavor from the wood. The maturation tanks  that Anheuser-Busch uses are horizontal and, as such, [[flocculation]] of the yeast occurs much more quickly. Anheuser-Busch refers to this process as a secondary fermentation, with the idea being that the chips give the yeast more surface area to rest on.  This is also combined with a [[Bottle conditioned#Krausening|krausening]] procedure that re-introduces wort into the chip tank therefore activating the fermentation process again.  By placing chips at the bottom of the tank, the yeast remains in suspension longer, giving it more time to reabsorb and process green beer flavors, such as acetaldehyde and diacetyl, that Anheuser-Busch believes are off-flavors which detract from overall drinkability.

Budweiser remains one of the world's lowest rated beers on notable rating sites such as [[Beer rating#BeerAdvocate|BeerAdvocate.com]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=BeerAdvocate.com, Inc. - Jason and Todd Alström |url=http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/29/65/ |title=Budweiser - Anheuser-Busch, Inc. - Saint Louis, MO |publisher=BeerAdvocate |date= |accessdate=September 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Beer rating#RateBeer|RateBeer.com]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ratebeer.com/Ratings/TheWorstBeers.asp |title=The Worst Beers In The World |publisher=RateBeer.com |date=May 23, 2004 |accessdate=September 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some drinkers prefer the lightness of beers like ''Budweiser'' and consume it as a refreshment or for its inebriating effects,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.beer.themanroom.com/beer-memberrating.php?&amp;id=54 | publisher=themanroom.com | title=Member's forum Rating}}&lt;/ref&gt; beer writers consider it to be bland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beerhunter.com/documents/19133-000776.html Hops to lighten your step] beerhunter.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.realbeer.com/news/articles/news-001477.php A Bud by any other name] realbeer.com&lt;/ref&gt; The beer is light-bodied with faint sweet notes and negligible bitterness, leading to reviews characterizing it as a &quot;...beer of underwhelming blandness&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | page=84 | title=The Beer Bible | last=Simpson | first = Willie | publisher=John Fairfax Publications | isbn = 978-1-921190-86-5 | year=2007 | location=Sydney}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based upon sales, however, it is the most popular American brewed [[pale lager]] among North American beer consumers.

''Budweiser'' and ''Bud Light'' are sometimes advertised as [[vegan]] beers, in that their ingredients and conditioning do not use animal by-products. Some might object to the inclusion of genetically engineered rice&lt;ref name=&quot;gp2&quot; &gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/press-center/releases2/greenpeace-exposes-anheuser-bu# | title=Greenpeace Exposes Anheuser Busch's Use of Genetically Engineered Rice in Beer Brewing Process | publisher=Greenpeace | date=October 8, 2007 | accessdate=December 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and animal products used in the brewing process.  In July 2006, Anheuser-Busch has brewed a version of ''Budweiser'' with organic rice, for sale in Mexico. They have yet to extend this practice to any other countries.

Anheuser-Busch was one of the few breweries during [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] that had the resources and wherewithal to convert to &quot;cereal beer&quot; production—malt beverage made with non-fermentables such as rice and unmalted barley and rye, and able to stay under the 0.5% limit established by the [[Volstead Act]]. Following the repeal of Prohibition in 1933, the major breweries continued to use unmalted cereal grains to provide the full body and mouthfeel of a &quot;real&quot; beer while keeping the alcohol content low.

==Budweiser brands==
{{Main|Anheuser-Busch brands#Budweiser}}
In addition to the regular ''Budweiser'', Anheuser-Busch brews several different beers under the ''Budweiser'' brand, including ''Bud Light'' and ''Bud Ice''.

In July 2010 [[Anheuser-Busch]] launched Budweiser 66 in the UK market. Budweiser Brew No.66 has 4% alcohol by volume, and is brewed and distributed in the UK by [[Inbev]] UK Limited

The '''Bermuda Triangle''', also known as the '''Devil's Triangle''', is a region in the western part of the North [[Atlantic Ocean]] where a number of [[aircraft]] and [[Surface ship|surface vessels]] allegedly disappeared under mysterious circumstances. Popular culture has attributed these disappearances to the [[paranormal]] or activity by [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial beings]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Cochran,2003&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

| page = 275
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Documented evidence indicates that a significant percentage of the incidents were inaccurately reported or embellished by later authors, and numerous official agencies have stated that the number and nature of disappearances in the region is similar to that in any other area of ocean.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.history.navy.mil/faqs/faq8-1.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.history.navy.mil/faqs/faq8-3.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uscg.mil/history/faqs/triangle.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Triangle area==
[[Image:triangles1.jpg|thumb|The area of the Triangle varies by author]]

The boundaries of the triangle cover the [[Straits of Florida]], the [[The Bahamas|Bahamas]] and the entire [[Caribbean]] island area and the Atlantic east to the [[Azores]]. The more familiar triangular boundary in most written works has as its points somewhere on the Atlantic coast of [[Miami]]; [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]], [[Puerto Rico]]; and the mid-Atlantic island of [[Bermuda]], with most of the accidents concentrated along the southern boundary around the Bahamas and the Florida Straits.

The area is one of the most heavily traveled shipping lanes in the world, with ships crossing through it daily for ports in the Americas, [[Europe]], and the Caribbean Islands. Cruise ships are also plentiful, and pleasure craft regularly go back and forth between Florida and the islands. It is also a heavily flown route for commercial and private aircraft heading towards Florida, the Caribbean, and [[South America]] from points north.

==History==
===Origins===
The earliest allegation of unusual disappearances in the Bermuda area appeared in a September 16, 1950 [[Associated Press]] article by Edward Van Winkle Jones.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jones,1950&quot;&gt;{{cite newspaper
| title = ''unknown title'', newspaper articles
| agency = Associated Press
| author = E.V.W. Jones
| date = September 16, 1950
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, ''[[Fate (magazine)|Fate]]'' magazine published &quot;Sea Mystery At Our Back Door&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Sand,1952&quot;&gt;{{cite journal
| title = Sea Mystery At Our Back Door
| author = George X. Sand
| journal = [[Fate (magazine)|Fate]]
| month = October| year=1952}}&lt;/ref&gt; a short article by George X. Sand covering the loss of several planes and ships, including the loss of [[Flight 19]], a group of five [[U.S. Navy]] [[TBM Avenger]] bombers on a training mission. Sand's article was the first to lay out the now-familiar triangular area where the losses took place. Flight 19 alone would be covered in the April 1962 issue of ''American Legion'' Magazine.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eckert,1962&quot; &gt;{{cite journal
| title = The Lost Patrol
| journal = American Legion
| author = Allen W. Eckert
| month = April| year=1962}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was claimed that the flight leader had been heard saying &quot;We are entering white water, nothing seems right. We don't know where we are, the water is green, no&lt;!-- NB: &quot;no&quot; is correct, &quot;not&quot; is incorrect&quot;--&gt; white.&quot; It was also claimed that officials at the Navy board of inquiry stated that the planes &quot;flew off to Mars.&quot; Sand's article was the first to suggest a supernatural element to the Flight 19 incident. In the February 1964 issue of ''[[Argosy (magazine)|Argosy]]'', [[Vincent Gaddis]]'s article &quot;The Deadly Bermuda Triangle&quot; argued that Flight 19 and other disappearances were part of a pattern of strange events in the region.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gaddis,1964&quot;/&gt; The next year, Gaddis expanded this article into a book, ''Invisible Horizons''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gaddis,1965&quot;&gt;{{cite book
| title = Invisible Horizons
| author = Vincent Gaddis
| year = 1965
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others would follow with their own works, elaborating on Gaddis's ideas: John Wallace Spencer (''Limbo of the Lost'', 1969, repr. 1973);&lt;ref name=&quot;Spencer,1969&quot;/&gt; [[Charles Berlitz]] (''The Bermuda Triangle'', 1974);&lt;ref name=&quot;Berlitz,1974&quot;/&gt; [[Richard Winer]] (''The Devil's Triangle'', 1974),&lt;ref name=&quot;Winer,1974&quot;/&gt; and many others, all keeping to some of the same supernatural elements outlined by Eckert.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eckert, 2004&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

===Larry Kusche===
{{anchor|Kusche.27s_explanation}}
[[Larry Kusche|Lawrence David Kusche]], a research librarian from [[Arizona State University]] and author of ''The Bermuda Triangle Mystery: Solved'' (1975)&lt;ref name=&quot;Kusche,1975&quot;/&gt; argued that many claims of Gaddis and subsequent writers were often exaggerated, dubious or unverifiable. Kusche's research revealed a number of inaccuracies and inconsistencies between Berlitz's accounts and statements from eyewitnesses, participants, and others involved in the initial incidents. Kusche noted cases where pertinent information went unreported, such as the disappearance of round-the-world yachtsman [[Donald Crowhurst]], which Berlitz had presented as a mystery, despite clear evidence to the contrary. Another example was the ore-carrier recounted by Berlitz as lost without trace three days out of an ''Atlantic'' port when it had been lost three days out of a port with the same name in the ''Pacific'' Ocean. Kusche also argued that a large percentage of the incidents that sparked allegations of the Triangle's mysterious influence actually occurred well outside it. Often his research was simple: he would review period newspapers of the dates of reported incidents and find reports on possibly relevant events like unusual weather, that were never mentioned in the disappearance stories.

Kusche concluded that:
*The number of ships and aircraft reported missing in the area was not significantly greater, proportionally speaking, than in any other part of the ocean.
*In an area frequented by [[tropical storm]]s, the number of disappearances that did occur were, for the most part, neither disproportionate, unlikely, nor mysterious; furthermore, Berlitz and other writers would often fail to mention such storms.
*The numbers themselves had been exaggerated by sloppy research. A boat's disappearance, for example, would be reported, but its eventual (if belated) return to port may not have been.
*Some disappearances had, in fact, never happened. One plane crash was said to have taken place in 1937 off [[Daytona Beach, Florida]], in front of hundreds of witnesses; a check of the local papers revealed nothing.
*The legend of the Bermuda Triangle is a manufactured mystery, perpetuated by writers who either purposely or unknowingly made use of misconceptions, faulty reasoning, and sensationalism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kusche,1975&quot;/&gt;

===Further responses===
When the UK Channel 4 television program &quot;The Bermuda Triangle&quot; (c. 1992) was being produced by John Simmons of Geofilms for the ''Equinox'' series, the marine insurer [[Lloyd's of London]] was asked if an unusually large number of ships had sunk in the Bermuda Triangle area. Lloyd's of London determined that large numbers of ships had not sunk there.&lt;ref name=&quot;WoodsHole Bermuda&quot;/&gt;

[[United States Coast Guard]] records confirm their conclusion. In fact, the number of supposed disappearances is relatively insignificant considering the number of ships and aircraft that pass through on a regular basis.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kusche,1975&quot;/&gt;

The Coast Guard is also officially skeptical of the Triangle, noting that they collect and publish, through their inquiries, much documentation contradicting many of the incidents written about by the Triangle authors. In one such incident involving the 1972 explosion and sinking of the tanker [[SS V. A. Fogg|SS ''V. A. Fogg'']] in the Gulf of Mexico, the Coast Guard photographed the wreck and recovered several bodies,&lt;ref name=&quot;USCG Fogg&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; in contrast with one Triangle author's claim that all the bodies had vanished, with the exception of the captain, who was found sitting in his cabin at his desk, clutching a coffee cup.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spencer,1969&quot;/&gt;

The [[NOVA (TV series)|NOVA]]/[[Horizon (BBC TV series)|Horizon]] episode ''The Case of the Bermuda Triangle'', aired on June 27, 1976, was highly critical, stating that &quot;When we've gone back to the original sources or the people involved, the mystery evaporates. Science does not have to answer questions about the Triangle because those questions are not valid in the first place... Ships and planes behave in the Triangle the same way they behave everywhere else in the world.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;NOVA,1976&quot;&gt;{{cite episode

David Kusche pointed out a common problem with many of the Bermuda Triangle stories and theories: &quot;Say I claim that a parrot has been kidnapped to teach aliens human language and I challenge you to prove that is ''not'' true.  You can even use Einstein's Theory of Relativity if you like.  There is simply no way to prove such a claim untrue. The burden of proof should be on the people who make these statements, to show where they got their information from, to see if their conclusions and interpretations are valid, and if they have left anything out.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;NOVA,1976&quot; &gt;{{cite episode

}}&lt;/ref&gt; have noted how mysteries and the paranormal are very popular and profitable. This has led to the production of vast amounts of material on topics such as the Bermuda Triangle. They were able to show that some of the pro-paranormal material is often misleading or inaccurate, but its producers continue to market it. Accordingly, they have claimed that the market is biased in favor of books, TV specials, and other media that support the Triangle mystery, and against well-researched material if it espouses a skeptical viewpoint.

Finally, if the Triangle is assumed to cross land, such as parts of Puerto Rico, the [[Bahamas]], or Bermuda itself, there is no evidence for the disappearance of any land-based vehicles or persons.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} The city of [[Freeport, Bahamas|Freeport]], located inside the Triangle, operates a major shipyard and an airport that handles 50,000 flights annually and is visited by over a million tourists a year.&lt;ref name=&quot;CIA&quot;&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/bf.html CIA World Factbook -- Bahamas, The]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Supernatural explanations==
Triangle writers have used a number of supernatural concepts to explain the events. One explanation pins the blame on leftover technology from the mythical lost continent of [[Atlantis]]. Sometimes connected to the Atlantis story is the submerged rock formation known as the [[Bimini Road]] off the island of [[Bimini]] in the Bahamas, which is in the Triangle by some definitions. Followers of the purported psychic [[Edgar Cayce]] take his prediction that evidence of Atlantis would be found in 1968 as referring to the discovery of the Bimini Road. Believers describe the formation as a road, wall, or other structure, though geologists consider it to be of natural origin.&lt;ref name=&quot;CSI,2004&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

Other writers attribute the events to [[UFO]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ufos.about.com/od/classicufocases/a/bermudatriangle.htm |title=UFO over Bermuda Triangle |publisher=Ufos.about.com |date=2008-06-29 |accessdate=2009-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; This idea was used by [[Steven Spielberg]] for his [[science fiction film]] ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'', which features the lost Flight 19 aircrews as alien abductees.

[[Charles Berlitz]], author of various books on anomalous phenomena, lists several theories attributing the losses in the Triangle to anomalous or unexplained forces.&lt;ref name=&quot;Berlitz,1974&quot;/&gt;

==Natural explanations==
===Compass variations===
[[Compass]] problems are one of the cited phrases in many Triangle incidents. While some have theorized that unusual local magnetic anomalies may exist in the area,&lt;ref name=&quot;USNAVY&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/faqs/faq8-1.htm|title=Bermuda Triangle|publisher=US Navy|accessdate=2009-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; such anomalies have not been shown to exist. Compasses have natural [[magnetic variation]]s in relation to the [[magnetic pole]]s, a fact which navigators have known for centuries. [[magnetic north pole|Magnetic (compass) north]] and [[true north|geographic (true) north]] are only exactly the same for a small number of places - for example, as of 2000 in the United States only those places on a line running from [[Wisconsin]] to the [[Gulf of Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=&lt;nowiki&gt;National Geomagnetism Program | Charts | North America | Declination&lt;/nowiki&gt;|publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]]|url=http://geomag.usgs.gov/charts/IGRF2000.dec.na.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2010-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; But the public may not be as informed, and think there is something mysterious about a compass &quot;changing&quot; across an area as large as the Triangle, which it naturally will.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kusche,1975&quot;/&gt;

===Deliberate acts of destruction===
Deliberate acts of destruction can fall into two categories: acts of war, and acts of piracy. Records in enemy files have been checked for numerous losses. While many sinkings have been attributed to surface raiders or submarines during the [[World Wars]] and documented in various command log books, many others suspected as falling in that category have not been proven. It is suspected that the loss of USS ''Cyclops'' in 1918, as well as her sister ships ''Proteus'' and ''Nereus'' in [[World War II]], were attributed to submarines, but no such link has been found in the German records.

[[Piracy]]&amp;mdash;the illegal capture of a craft on the high seas&amp;mdash;continues to this day. While piracy for cargo theft is more common in the western Pacific and Indian oceans, drug smugglers do steal pleasure boats for smuggling operations, and may have been involved in crew and yacht disappearances in the Caribbean. [[Piracy in the Caribbean]] was common from about 1560 to the 1760s, and famous pirates included Edward Teach ([[Blackbeard]]) and [[Jean Lafitte]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

[[Image:Gulfstream1.jpg|thumb|upright|False-color image of the Gulf Stream flowing north through the western Atlantic Ocean. (NASA)]]

===Gulf Stream===
The [[Gulf Stream]] is an ocean current that originates in the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and then flows through the [[Straits of Florida]] into the North Atlantic. In essence, it is a river within an ocean, and, like a river, it can and does carry floating objects. It has a surface velocity of up to about 2.5 metres per second (5.6&amp;nbsp;mi/h).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Phillips|first=Pamela|title=The Gulf Stream|url=http://fermi.jhuapl.edu/student/phillips/|publisher=USNA/Johns Hopkins|accessdate=2007-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; A small plane making a [[water landing]] or a boat having engine trouble can be carried away from its reported position by the current.

===Human error===
One of the most cited explanations in official inquiries as to the loss of any aircraft or vessel is human error.&lt;ref name=&quot;NATGEO&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2002/12/1205_021205_bermudatriangle.html|title=Bermuda Triangle: Behind the Intrigue|publisher=National Geographic|accessdate=2009-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether deliberate or accidental, humans have been known to make mistakes resulting in catastrophe, and losses within the Bermuda Triangle are no exception. For example, the Coast Guard cited a lack of proper training for the cleaning of volatile [[benzene]] residue as a reason for the loss of the tanker SS ''V.A. Fogg'' in 1972{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}. Human stubbornness may have caused businessman Harvey Conover to lose his sailing yacht, the ''Revonoc'', as he sailed into the teeth of a storm south of Florida on January 1, 1958.&lt;ref name=&quot;CaptainScott&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Scott|first=Captain Thomas A. |title=Histories &amp; Mysteries: The Shipwrecks of Key Largo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hurricanes===
[[Tropical cyclone|Hurricanes]] are powerful storms, which form in tropical waters and have historically cost thousands of lives lost and caused billions of dollars in damage. The sinking of [[Francisco de Bobadilla]]'s Spanish fleet in 1502 was the first recorded instance of a destructive hurricane. These storms have in the past caused a number of incidents related to the Triangle.

===Methane hydrates===
{{Main|Methane clathrate}}
[[Image:Worldwide distribution of gas hydrates 1996.jpg|thumb|Worldwide distribution of confirmed or inferred offshore gas hydrate-bearing sediments, 1996.&lt;br /&gt;Source: [[USGS]]]]
An explanation for some of the disappearances has focused on the presence of vast fields of [[methane]] hydrates (a form of natural gas) on the [[continental shelves]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Energy Citations Database (ECD) -  - Document #616279&quot;&gt;{{cite web
| url = http://www.osti.gov/energycitations/product.biblio.jsp?osti_id=616279
| title = Office of Scientific &amp; Technical Information, OSTI, U.S. Department of Energy, DOE

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Laboratory experiments carried out in Australia have proven that bubbles can, indeed, sink a scale model ship by decreasing the density of the water;&lt;ref name=&quot;Monash,2003&quot;&gt;{{cite web
| url = http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3226787/
| title = Could methane bubbles sink ships?
| publisher = Monash Univ.
}}&lt;/ref&gt; any wreckage consequently rising to the surface would be rapidly dispersed by the [[Gulf Stream]]. It has been hypothesized that periodic methane [[eruption]]s (sometimes called &quot;[[mud volcano]]es&quot;) may produce regions of frothy water that are no longer capable of providing adequate [[buoyancy]] for ships. If this were the case, such an area forming around a ship could cause it to sink very rapidly and without warning.

Publications by the [[United States Geological Survey|USGS]] describe large stores of undersea hydrates worldwide, including the [[Blake Ridge]] area, off the southeastern [[United States]] coast.&lt;ref name=&quot;WoodsHole papers&quot;&gt;{{cite web

===Rogue waves===
In various oceans around the world, [[rogue waves]] have caused ships to sink&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/11/science/11wave.html?8dpc | work=The New York Times | title=Rogue Giants at Sea | first=William J. | last=Broad | date=July 11, 2006 | accessdate=March 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and oil platforms to topple.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uscg.mil/hq/gm/moa/boards/oceanranger.pdf ]{{Dead link|date=June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; These waves, until 1995, were considered to be a mystery and/or a myth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/esaCP/SEMOKQL26WD_index_0.html |title=ESA Portal - Ship-sinking monster waves revealed by ESA satellites |publisher=Esa.int |date=1995-01-01 |accessdate=2009-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/strangenews/080804-rogue-waves.html |title=Secret to Towering Rogue Waves Revealed |publisher=LiveScience |date=2008-08-04 |accessdate=2009-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable incidents==
{{Main|List of Bermuda Triangle incidents}}

===Flight 19===
{{main|Flight 19}}
[[Image:TBF (Avengers) flying in formation.jpg|upright|thumb|US Navy TBF Grumman Avenger flight, similar to Flight 19. This photo had been used by various Triangle authors to illustrate Flight 19 itself. (US Navy)]]
Flight 19 was a training flight of [[TBM Avenger]] bombers that went missing on December 5, 1945, while over the Atlantic. The squadron's flight path was scheduled to take them due east for 120 miles, north for 73 miles, and then back over a final 120-mile leg that would return them to the naval base, but they never returned. The impression is given{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} that the flight encountered unusual phenomena and anomalous compass readings, and that the flight took place on a calm day under the supervision of an experienced pilot, Lt. Charles Carroll Taylor. Adding to the intrigue is that the Navy's report of the accident ascribed it to &quot;causes or reasons unknown.&quot;{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Adding to the mystery, a search and rescue [[Mariner aircraft]] with a 13-man crew was dispatched to aid the missing squadron, but the Mariner itself was never heard from again. Later, there was a report from a tanker cruising off the coast of Florida of a visible explosion&lt;ref name = &quot;The_Loss_of_Flight_19&quot;&gt;{{cite web
| url = http://www.history.navy.mil/faqs/faq15-1.htm
| title = The Loss of Flight 19
|publisher = [http://www.history.navy.mil/]
}}&lt;/ref&gt; at about the time the Mariner would have been on patrol.

While the basic facts of this version of the story are essentially accurate, some important details are missing. The weather was becoming stormy by the end of the incident, and naval reports and written recordings of the conversations between Taylor and the other pilots of Flight 19 do not indicate magnetic problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;the_disappearance_of_flight_19&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Mary Celeste''===
{{main|Mary Celeste}}

The mysterious abandonment in 1872 of the 282-ton [[brigantine]] ''Mary Celeste'' is often but inaccurately connected to the Triangle, the ship having been abandoned off the coast of [[Portugal]]. The event is possibly confused with the loss of a ship with a similar name, the ''Mari Celeste,'' a 207-ton [[paddle steamer]] that hit a [[reef]] and quickly sank off the coast of Bermuda on September 13, 1864.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shipwreckexpo.com/bermudashipwrecksmariceleste.htm |title=Mari Celeste Wreck |publisher=Shipwreckexpo.com |accessdate=2009-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Berg,2000&quot;/&gt; Kusche noted that many of the &quot;facts&quot; about this incident were actually about the ''Marie Céleste'', the fictional ship from [[Arthur Conan Doyle]]'s short story &quot;[[J. Habakuk Jephson's Statement]]&quot; (based on the real ''Mary Celeste'' incident, but fictionalised).

===''Ellen Austin''===
The ''Ellen Austin'' supposedly came across a derelict ship, placed on board a prize crew, and attempted to sail with it to New York in 1881. According to the stories, the derelict disappeared; others elaborating further that the derelict reappeared minus the prize crew, then disappeared again with a second prize crew on board. A check from [[Lloyd's of London]] records proved the existence of the ''Meta'', built in 1854 and that in 1880 the ''Meta'' was renamed ''Ellen Austin''. There are no casualty listings for this vessel, or any vessel at that time, that would suggest a large number of missing men were placed on board a derelict that later disappeared.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bermuda Triangle, Ellen Austin&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===USS ''Cyclops''===
{{main|USS Cyclops (AC-4)}}

The incident resulting in the single largest loss of life in the history of the US Navy not related to combat occurred when [[USS Cyclops (AC-4)|USS ''Cyclops'']], under the command of [[Lieutenant Commander|Lt Cdr]] [[G.W. Worley]], went missing without a trace with a crew of 309 sometime after March 4, 1918, after departing the island of [[Barbados]]. Although there is no strong evidence for any single theory, many independent theories exist, some blaming storms, some capsizing, and some suggesting that [[World War I|wartime enemy activity]] was to blame for the loss.&lt;ref name=&quot;DMerrill&quot;&gt;{{cite web

===Theodosia Burr Alston===
{{further|[[Theodosia Burr Alston]]}}

Theodosia Burr Alston was the daughter of former [[Vice President of the United States|United States Vice President]] [[Aaron Burr]]. Her disappearance has been cited at least once in relation to the Triangle.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jeffrey,1975&quot;/&gt; She was a passenger on board the ''Patriot'', which sailed from [[Charleston, South Carolina]] to [[New York, New York|New York City]] on December 30, 1812, and was never heard from again. The planned route is well outside all but the most extended versions of the Bermuda Triangle. Both piracy and the [[War of 1812]] have been posited as explanations, as well as a theory placing her in Texas, well outside the Triangle.

[[Image:deering2.jpg|left|thumb|[[Schooner]] ''[[Carroll A. Deering]]'', as seen from the [[Cape Lookout]] [[lightvessel]] on January 29, 1921, two days before she was found deserted in [[North Carolina]]. (US Coast Guard)]]

===''Carroll A. Deering''===
{{main|Carroll A. Deering}}

A five-masted schooner built in 1919, the ''Carroll A. Deering'' was found hard aground and abandoned at Diamond Shoals, near [[Cape Hatteras]], [[North Carolina]] on January 31, 1921. Rumors and more at the time indicated the ''Deering'' was a victim of piracy, possibly connected with the illegal rum-running trade during [[Prohibition]], and possibly involving another ship, S.S. ''Hewitt'', which disappeared at roughly the same time. Just hours later, an unknown steamer sailed near the lightship along the track of the ''Deering'', and ignored all signals from the lightship. It is speculated that the ''Hewitt'' may have been this mystery ship, and possibly involved in the ''Deering'' crew's disappearance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Deering&quot;&gt;{{cite web

===Douglas DC-3===
{{main|NC16002 disappearance}}

On December 28, 1948, a [[Douglas DC-3]] aircraft, number [[NC16002 disappearance|NC16002]], disappeared while on a flight from San Juan, Puerto Rico, to Miami. No trace of the aircraft or the 32 people onboard was ever found. From the documentation compiled by the Civil Aeronautics Board investigation, a possible key to the plane's disappearance was found, but barely touched upon by the Triangle writers: the plane's batteries were inspected and found to be low on charge, but ordered back into the plane without a recharge by the pilot while in San Juan. Whether or not this led to complete electrical failure will never be known. However, since piston-engined aircraft rely upon [[Magneto (electrical)|magnetos]] to provide spark to their cylinders rather than a battery powered [[ignition coil]] system, this theory is not strongly convincing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aviation Safety DC3&quot;&gt;{{cite web

[[G-AHNP &quot;Star Tiger&quot;|G-AHNP ''Star Tiger'']] disappeared on January 30, 1948 on a flight from the Azores to Bermuda; [[G-AGRE &quot;Star Ariel&quot;|G-AGRE ''Star Ariel'']] disappeared on January 17, 1949, on a flight from Bermuda to [[Kingston, Jamaica]]. Both were [[Avro]] [[Tudor IV]] passenger aircraft operated by [[British South American Airways]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bermuda Triangle, Tudors&quot;&gt;{{cite web

===KC-135 Stratotankers===
On August 28, 1963, a pair of [[US Air Force]] [[KC-135 Stratotanker]] aircraft collided and crashed into the Atlantic. The Triangle version (Winer, Berlitz, Gaddis&lt;ref name=&quot;Gaddis,1964&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Berlitz,1974&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Winer,1974&quot;/&gt;) of this story specifies that they did collide and crash, but there were two distinct crash sites, separated by over {{convert|160|mi|km}} of water. However, Kusche's research&lt;ref name=&quot;Kusche,1975&quot;/&gt; showed that the unclassified version of the Air Force investigation report stated that the debris field defining the second &quot;crash site&quot; was examined by a search and rescue ship, and found to be a mass of [[seaweed]] and [[driftwood]] tangled in an old [[buoy]].

===''SS Marine Sulphur Queen''===
{{main|SS Marine Sulphur Queen}}

''[[SS Marine Sulphur Queen]]'', a [[T2 tanker]] converted from oil to [[sulfur]] carrier, was last heard from on February 4, 1963 with a crew of 39 near the Florida Keys.

===''Connemara IV''===
A pleasure yacht was found adrift in the Atlantic south of Bermuda on September 26, 1955; it is usually stated in the stories (Berlitz, Winer&lt;ref name=&quot;Berlitz,1974&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Winer,1974&quot;/&gt;) that the crew vanished while the yacht survived being at sea during three hurricanes. The [[1955 Atlantic hurricane season]] shows [[Hurricane Ione]] passing nearby between the 14th and 18th of that month, with Bermuda being affected by winds of almost gale force.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kusche,1975&quot;/&gt; It was confirmed that the ''Connemara IV'' was empty and in port when Ione may have caused the yacht to slip her moorings and drift out to sea. {{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

==Influence on culture==
===Entertainment===
* The [[Sea World]] [[amusement park]] on the [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]] ([[Australia]]) operated a ride called [[Bermuda Triangle (Sea World)|Bermuda Triangle]].

===Music===
* Composer [[Isao Tomita]] released an album, ''[[Bermuda Triangle (Tomita album)|Bermuda Triangle]]'', inspired by the region.
* Singer Songwriter [[Barry Manilow]] released a single &quot;[[Bermuda Triangle (song)|Bermuda Triangle]]&quot; in 1981, taken from his 1980 album [[Barry (album)|Barry]]. The song references the area to depict loss (&quot;The Bermuda Triangle makes people disappear&quot;), however the allusion is centred around romantic loss, and caused by fickleness rather than paranormal activity.

===Movies===
* [[The Triangle (film)|The Triangle]], a 2001 thriller television movie, is set in the Bermuda Triangle.
* [[The Triangle (TV miniseries)|The Triangle]] is also a three-part science fiction miniseries concerning the Bermuda Triangle.

{{wiktionary}}
A '''borough''' is an [[administrative division]] in various countries. In principle, the term ''borough'' designates a self-governing [[township]] although, in practice, official use of the term varies widely. 

The word ''borough'' derives from common [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] ''*burgs'', meaning ''fort'': compare with ''bury'' (England), ''burgh'' (Scotland), ''Burg'' (Germany), ''borg'' (Scandinavia), ''burcht'' (Dutch) and the Germanic borrowing present in neighbouring [[Indo-european languages]] such as ''borgo'' (Italian), ''bourg'' (French) and ''burgo'' (Spanish and Portuguese). The incidence of these words as suffixes to place names (for example, [[Canterbury]], [[Strasbourg]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Edinburgh]], [[Hamburg]], [[Gothenburg]]) usually indicates that they were once fortified settlements. 

In the [[Middle Ages]], boroughs were settlements in England that were granted some [[self-government]]; burghs were the Scottish equivalent. In [[medieval England]], boroughs were also entitled to elect members of [[Parliament of England|parliament]]. The use of the word ''borough'' probably derives from the burghal system of [[Alfred the Great]]. Alfred set up a system of defensive strong points ([[Burh]]s); in order to maintain these settlements, he granted them a degree of autonomy. After the [[Norman Conquest]], when certain towns were granted self-governance, the concept of the burh/borough seems to have been reused to mean a self-governing settlement.

The concept of the borough has been used repeatedly (and often differently) throughout the [[English-speaking world]]. Often, a borough is a single town with its own local government. However, in some cities it is a subdivision of the city (for example, [[London]], [[New York City]], and [[Montreal]]). In such cases, the borough will normally have either limited powers delegated to it by the city's local government, or no powers at all. At certain times, London has had no overall city government and boroughs were the main unit of local government for Londoners. In other places, such as [[Alaska]], ''borough'' designates a whole [[region]]; Alaska's largest borough, the [[North Slope Borough, Alaska|North Slope Borough]], is comparable in area to the entire [[United Kingdom]]. In [[Australia]], ''borough'' can designate a town and its surrounding area, such as the [[Borough of Queenscliffe]].

Boroughs as administrative units are to be found in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] and the United Kingdom, more specifically in [[England]] and [[Northern Ireland]]. Boroughs also exist in the [[Canada|Canadian]] [[Provinces and territories of Canada|province]] of [[Quebec]] and formerly in [[Ontario]], in some [[U.S. state|states]] of the [[United States]], in [[Israel]], and formerly in [[New Zealand]].

==Pronunciation==
In many parts of England, &quot;borough&quot; is pronounced {{IPAc-en|en-borough.ogg|ˈ|b|ʌr|ə}} as an independent word, and as {{IPAc-en|b|r|ə}} when a suffix of a place-name. As a suffix, it is sometimes spelled &quot;-brough&quot;.

In the United States, &quot;borough&quot; is pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ʌr|oʊ}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ʊər|oʊ}}. When appearing as the suffix &quot;-burg(h)&quot; in place-names, it is pronounced {{IPAc-en|b|ɜr|ɡ}}.

==Uses of ''borough''==
===England and Wales===
{{main|History of local government in England|Borough status in the United Kingdom}}

====Ancient and municipal boroughs====
{{Main|Ancient borough|Municipal borough}}
During the medieval period many towns were granted self-governance by the Crown, at which point they became referred to as a borough. The formal status of borough came to be conferred by [[Royal Charter]]. These boroughs were generally governed by a self-selecting corporation (i.e., when a member died or resigned his replacement would be by [[co-option]]). Sometimes boroughs were governed by [[bailiffs]] or headboroughs.

Debates on the Reform Bill (eventually the [[Reform Act 1832]]) had highlighted the variations in systems of governance of towns, and a [[Royal Commission]] was set up to investigate the issue. This resulted in a regularisation of municipal government ([[Municipal Corporations Act 1835]]). 178 of the ancient boroughs were reformed as ''municipal boroughs'', with all municipal corporations to be elected according to a standard franchise based on property ownership. The unreformed boroughs either lapsed in borough status, or were reformed (or abolished) at a later time. Several new municipal boroughs were formed in the new industrial cities after the bill enacted, according to the provisions of the bill.

As part of a large-scale reform of local government in England and Wales [[Local Government Act 1972|in 1974]], municipal boroughs were finally abolished (having become increasingly irrelevant). However, the civic traditions of many boroughs were continued by the grant of a [[Royal Charter|charter]] to their successor district councils. In smaller boroughs, a [[Parish councils in England|town council]] was formed for the area of the abolished borough, while [[charter trustees]] were formed in other former boroughs. In each case, the new body was allowed to use the regalia of the old corporation, and appoint ceremonial office holders such as sword and mace bearers as provided in their original charters. The council or trustees may apply for an [[Order in Council]] or [[Royal Licence]] to use the former borough [[coat of arms]].

====Parliamentary boroughs====
{{See|Reform Act 1832}}

From 1265, two burgesses from each borough were summoned to the [[Parliament of England]], alongside two [[knights]] from each [[county]]. Thus parliamentary constituencies were derived from the ancient boroughs. Representation in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] was decided by the House itself, which resulted in boroughs' being established in some small settlements for the purposes of parliamentary representation, despite their possessing no actual corporation. 

After the Reform Act, which disenfranchised many of the [[rotten borough]]s (boroughs that had declined in importance, had only a small population, and had only a handful of eligible voters), parliamentary constituencies began to diverge from the ancient boroughs. While many ancient boroughs remained as municipal boroughs, they were disenfranchised by the Reform Act.

====County boroughs====
{{Main|County boroughs}}

The [[Local Government Act 1888]] established a new sort of borough &amp;ndash; the county borough. These were designed to be 'counties-to-themselves'; administrative divisions to sit alongside the new administrative counties. They allowed urban areas to be administered separately from the more rural areas. They, therefore, often contained pre-existing municipal boroughs, which thereafter became part of the second tier of local government, below the administrative counties and county boroughs.

The county boroughs were, like the municipal boroughs, abolished in 1974, being reabsorbed into their parent counties for administrative purposes.

====Metropolitan boroughs====
{{Main|Metropolitan borough}}

In 1899, as part of a reform of local government in the [[County of London]], the various parishes in London were reorganised as new entities, the 'metropolitan boroughs'. These were reorganised further when [[Greater London]] was formed out of Middlesex and the County of London in 1965.

When the new metropolitan counties (Greater Manchester, Merseyside, Tyne &amp; Wear, West Midlands, South Yorkshire and West Yorkshire) were created in 1974, their sub-divisions also became metropolitan boroughs; in many cases these metropolitan boroughs recapitulated abolished county boroughs (for example, [[Metropolitan Borough of Stockport|Stockport]]). The metropolitan boroughs possessed slightly more autonomy from the metropolitan county councils than the shire county districts did from their county councils.

With the abolition of the metropolitan county councils in 1986, these metropolitan boroughs became independent, and continue to be so at present.

====Other current uses====
Elsewhere in England a number of [[districts of England|district]] and [[unitary authority]] councils are called &quot;borough&quot;. Throughout history, this was a status that denoted towns with a certain type of local government (a [[municipal corporation]]). Since 1974, it has been a purely ceremonial style granted by royal charter, which entitles the council chairman to bear the title of [[Mayors in England|mayor]]. Districts may apply to the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British Crown]] for the grant of borough status upon advice of the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom]].

===Northern Ireland===
In [[Northern Ireland]], local government was reorganised in 1973. Under the legislation that created the 26 [[districts of Northern Ireland]], a district council whose area included an existing [[municipal borough]] could resolve to adopt the charter of the old municipality and thus continue to enjoy borough status. Districts that do not contain a former borough can apply for a charter in a similar manner to [[England|English]] districts.

===Canada===
{{main|Municipal government in Canada}}
In [[Quebec]], the term '''borough''' is generally used as the English translation of [[arrondissement]], referring to an administrative division of a municipality. Only eight municipalities in Quebec are divided into boroughs. See [[List of boroughs in Quebec]].

It was previously used in [[Metropolitan Toronto]], [[Ontario]], to denote suburban municipalities. The Borough of [[East York]] was the last Toronto municipality to hold this status, relinquishing it upon becoming part of the [[City of Toronto]] on January 1, 1998.

===United States===
{{main|Borough (United States)}}
In the [[United States]], a borough is a unit of [[local government]] below the level of the [[US states|state]]. The term is currently used in seven states.

The following states use, or have used, the word with the following meanings:
*[[Alaska]], as a [[county-equivalent]]
*[[Connecticut]], as an incorporated municipality within, or consolidated with, a [[New England town|town]]
*[[Minnesota]], formerly applied to one municipality
*[[New Jersey]], as a type of independent incorporated municipality - see [[Borough (New Jersey)]]
*[[New York State|New York]], as one of the five divisions of [[New York City]], each coextensive with a county - See [[Borough (New York City)]]
*[[Pennsylvania]], as a type of municipality comparable to a town. Only one incorporated town is chartered in Pennsylvania. - see [[Borough (Pennsylvania)]]
*[[Virginia]], as a division of a city under certain circumstances.

===Mexico===
In [[Mexico]] as translations from [[English language|English]] to [[Spanish language|Spanish]] applied to [[Mexico City]], the word ''borough'' has resulted in a '''delegación''' (delegation), referring to the 16 administrative areas within the Mexican Federal District. ('''see''': [[Boroughs of Mexico]] and [[Boroughs of the Mexican Federal District]])

===Australia===
In [[Australia]], the term &quot;borough&quot; is an occasionally used term for a local government area. Currently there is only one borough in Australia, the [[Borough of Queenscliffe]] in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], although there have been more in the past.

===Republic of Ireland===
Under the [[Local Government Act 2001]] section 10 (3) and schedule 6 part 1 chapter 1, the following continue to be known as Boroughs (though this is largely a matter of nomenclature) [[Clonmel]], [[Drogheda]], [[Kilkenny]], [[Sligo]], [[Wexford]]. In Section 10 (7) continues the &quot;use of the description city in relation to Kilkenny, to the extent that that description was used before (January 1, 2002) and is not otherwise inconsistent with this Act.&quot;

===New Zealand===
[[New Zealand]] formerly used the term borough to designate self-governing towns of more than 1,000 people, although 19th century census records show many boroughs with populations as low as 200.&lt;ref&gt;[http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~sooty/nzcensus1881.html 1881 census summary]&lt;/ref&gt; A borough of more than 20,000 people could become a city by proclamation. Boroughs and cities were collectively known as municipalities, and were [[enclave]]s separate from their surrounding counties. Boroughs proliferated in the suburban areas of the larger cities: By the 1980s there were 19 boroughs and three cities in the area that is now the City of Auckland.

In the 1980s, some boroughs and cities began to be merged with their surrounding counties to form [[district]]s with a mixed urban and rural population. In 1989, a nationwide reform of local government completed the process. Counties and boroughs were abolished and all boundaries were redrawn. Under the new system, most territorial authorities cover both urban and rural land. The more populated councils are classified as cities, and the more rural councils are classified as districts. Only [[Kawerau]] District, an enclave within [[Whakatane]] District, continues to follow the tradition of a small town council that does not include surrounding rural area.

===Israel===
Under Israeli law, inherited from [[Mandate for Palestine|British Mandate]] municipal law, the possibility of creating a municipal borough exists. However, no borough was actually created under law until 2005–2006, when [[Neve Monosson]] and [[Maccabim-Re'ut]], both communal settlements (Heb: '''''yishuv kehilati''''') founded in 1953 and 1984, respectively, were declared to be autonomous municipal boroughs (Heb: '''''vaad rova ironi'''''), within their mergers with the towns of [[Yehud]] and [[Modi'in]]. Similar structures have been created under different types of legal status over the years in Israel, notably [[Qiryat Chaim|Kiryat Haim]] in [[Haifa]], [[Jaffa]] in [[Tel Aviv-Yafo]] and [[Ramot]] and [[Gilo]] in [[Jerusalem]]. However, Neve Monosson is the first example of a full municipal borough actually declared under law by the Minister of the Interior, under a model subsequently adopted in [[Maccabim-Re'ut]] as well.

It is the declared intention of the Interior Ministry to use the borough mechanism in order to facilitate municipal mergers in Israel, after a 2003 wide-reaching merger plan, which, in general, ignored the sensitivities of the communal settlements, and largely failed.

===Netherlands===
Larger cities in the [[Netherlands]] are often divided into boroughs, or [[Stadsdeel|stadsdelen]]

==Etymology==
The word ''borough'' derives from the [[Old English]] word ''burh'', meaning a fortified settlement. Other English derivatives of ''burh'' include ''bury'' and ''brough''. There are obvious [[cognates]] in other [[Indo-European]] languages. For example; ''burgh'' in [[Scots language|Scots]] and [[Middle English]]; ''burg'' in [[German language|German]] and [[Old English]],&lt;ref&gt;The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language: Fourth Edition (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; ''borg'' in Scandinavian languages; ''parcus'' in [[Latin]] and ''pyrgos'' in [[Greek language|Greek]]. 

A number of other European languages have cognate words that were borrowed from the Germanic languages during the [[Middle Ages]], including ''brog'' in [[Irish language|Irish]], ''bwr'' or ''bwrc'', meaning &quot;wall, rampart&quot; in [[Welsh language|Welsh]], ''bourg'' in [[French language|French]], ''burg'' in [[Catalan language|Catalan]] (in Catalonia there is a town named ''Burg''), ''[[borgo]]'' in [[Italian language|Italian]], and ''burgo'' in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] (hence the place-name [[Burgos]]).

The 'burg' element is often confused with 'berg' meaning hill or mountain (cf. [[iceberg]]). Hence the 'berg' element in [[Bergen]] relates to a hill, rather than a fort. In some cases, the 'berg' element in place names has converged towards burg/borough; for instance Farnborough, from ''fernaberga'' (fern-hill).

'''Bodmin''' ({{lang-kw|Bosvenegh}}) is a [[civil parishes in England|civil parish]] and major town in [[Cornwall]], [[England]], [[United Kingdom]]. It is situated in the centre of the county southwest of [[Bodmin Moor]].&lt;ref&gt;Ordnance Survey: Landranger map sheet 200 ''Newquay &amp; Bodmin'' ISBN 978-0-319-22938-5&lt;/ref&gt;

The civil parish closely reflects the boundary of the town and is mostly urban in character. It is bordered to the east by [[Cardinham]] parish, to the southeast by [[Lanhydrock]] parish, to the southwest and west by [[Lanivet]] parish, and to the north by [[Helland]] parish.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mapping.cornwall.gov.uk/website/ccmap/] Cornwall Council online mapping. Retrieved May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Bodmin has a population of 12,778 (2001 census). It was formerly the [[county town]] of Cornwall until the Crown Courts moved to [[Truro]] which is also the administrative centre (before 1835 the county town was [[Launceston, Cornwall|Launceston]]). Bodmin was in the administrative [[North Cornwall]] District until local government reorganisation in 2009 abolished the District (''see also [[Politics of Cornwall#Cornwall Council]]'').

Bodmin Town Council is made up of 16 councillors who are elected to serve a term of four years. Each year, the Council elects one of their number as Mayor to serve as the town's civic leader and to chair council meetings&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bodmin.gov.uk] Bodmin Council website. Retrieved May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Situation and origin of the name==
Bodmin lies in the centre of Cornwall, south-west of [[Bodmin Moor]]. It has been suggested that the town's name comes from an archaic word in the [[Cornish language|Cornish]] &quot;bod&quot; (meaning a dwelling; the later word is &quot;bos&quot;) and a contraction of &quot;menegh&quot; (monks). It may however refer to an earlier monastic settlement instituted by St. Guron, which St. Petroc took as his site. Guron is said to have departed to [[St Goran]] on the arrival of Petroc.

==History==
[[Saint Petroc|St. Petroc]] founded a monastery in Bodmin in the sixth century&lt;ref&gt;Doble, G. H. (1965) ''The Saints of Cornwall: part 4''. Truro: Dean and Chapter; pp. 132-166&lt;/ref&gt; and gave the town its alternative name of ''Petrockstow''. The monastery was deprived of some of its lands at the Norman Conquest but at the time of Domesday still held 18 manors, including Bodmin, Padstow and Rialton.&lt;ref&gt;Thorn, C. et al. (eds.) (1979) ''Cornwall''. Chichester: Phillimore; entries 4,3-4.22&lt;/ref&gt; Bodmin is one of the oldest towns in Cornwall, and the only large Cornish settlement recorded in the [[Domesday Book]] of the late 11th century. In the 15th century the Norman church of St Petroc was largely rebuilt and stands as one of the largest churches in Cornwall (the largest after the cathedral at Truro). Also built at that time was an abbey of canons regular, now mostly ruined. For most of Bodmin's history, the [[tin]] industry was a mainstay of the economy.

An inscription on a stone built into the wall of a summer house in Lancarffe furnishes proof of a settlement in Bodmin in the early [[Middle Ages]]. It is a memorial to one &quot;Duno[.]atus son of Me[.]cagnus&quot; and has been dated from the sixth to eighth centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Discussion, photo and bibliography in Okasha, Elisabeth (1993). ''Corpus of early Christian inscribed stones of South-west Britain'' Leicester: University Press, pp. 126-128&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Black Death]] killed half of Bodmin's population in the mid 14th century (1500 people).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cornwall.gov.uk/index.cfm?articleid=5749|title=Black Death|accessdate=2009-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rebellions===
Bodmin was the centre of three Cornish uprisings. The first was the [[Cornish Rebellion of 1497]] when a Cornish army, led by [[Michael An Gof]], a blacksmith from [[St. Keverne]]. and [[Thomas Flamank]], a lawyer from Bodmin, marched to Blackheath in London where they were eventually defeated by 10,000 men of the King's army under Baron Daubeny. Then, in the Autumn of 1497, [[Perkin Warbeck]] tried to usurp the throne from [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]]. Warbeck was proclaimed King Richard IV in Bodmin but Henry had little difficulty crushing the uprising. Finally, in 1549, Cornishmen rose once again in rebellion when the staunchly Protestant [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]] tried to impose a new [[Book of Common Prayer|Prayer Book]]. Cornish people were still strongly attached to the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] religion and again a Cornish army was formed in Bodmin which marched across the border to lay siege to Exeter in Devon. This became known as the [[Prayer Book Rebellion]]. Proposals to translate the Prayer Book into Cornish were suppressed and in total 4,000 people were killed in the rebellion.&lt;ref&gt;Sturt, John (1987) Revolt in the West: the Western Rebellion of 1549. Exeter: Devon Books&lt;/ref&gt;

==Churches==
===Parish church of St Petroc===
{{Main|Bodmin Parish Church}}

The existing church building is dated 1469-72 and was until the building of [[Truro Cathedral]] the largest church in Cornwall. The tower which remains from the original Norman church and stands on the north side of the church (the upper part is 15th century) was, until the loss of its spire in 1699, 150&amp;nbsp;ft high. The building underwent two Victorian restorations and another in 1930. It is now listed Grade I. There are a number of interesting monuments, most notably that of Prior Vivian which was formerly in the Priory Church (Thomas Vivian's effigy lying on a chest: black Catacleuse stone and grey marble). The font of a type common in Cornwall is of the twelfth century: large and finely carved.&lt;ref&gt;Pevsner, N. (1970) ''Cornwall''; second ed. Penguin Books&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sedding, Edmund H. (1909) ''Norman Architecture in Cornwall: a handbook to old ecclesiastical architecture''. London: Ward &amp; Co.; pp. 21-36&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other churches===
The Chapel of St Thomas Becket is a ruin of a 14th century building in Bodmin churchyard. The holy well of St Guron is a small stone building at the churchyard gate. The Berry Tower is all that remains of the former church of the Holy Rood and there are even fewer remains from the substantial Franciscan Friary established ca. 1240: a gateway in Fore Street and two pillars elsewhere in the town. The Roman Catholic [[Abbey of St Mary and St Petroc]], formerly belonging to the [[Canons Regular]] of the Lateran was built in 1965 next to the already existing seminary.&lt;ref name=&quot;pevsner1970&quot;&gt;[[Nikolaus Pevsner|Pevsner, N.]] (1970) ''Cornwall'', second ed. Penguin Books.&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman Catholic parish of Bodmin includes a large area of North Cornwall and there are churches also at Wadebridge, Padstow and Tintagel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stmarysbodmin.org.uk/ |title=Parish of St Mary, Bodmin |accessdate=2009-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1881 the Roman Catholic mass was celebrated in Bodmin for the first time since 1539. A church was planned in the 1930s but delayed by [[World War II]]: the Church of St Mary and St Petroc was eventually consecrated in 1965:&lt;ref&gt;Dyer, Peter (2005) ''Tintagel: a portrait of a parish''. Cambridge: Cambridge Books ISBN 0-9550097-0-7; p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; it was built next to the already existing seminary.&lt;ref name=&quot;pevsner1970&quot;/&gt; There are also five other churches in Bodmin, including a Methodist church.

===Archdeaconry of Bodmin===
The Archdeaconry of Bodmin is one of two in the Anglican [[Diocese of Truro]] and covers the eastern part of the diocese. The archdeaconry includes five deaneries: East Wivelshire, Stratton, Trigg Major, Trigg Minor and Bodmin, West Wivelshire. It was established in 1878, two years after the [[Diocese of Truro]] was created, by splitting the [[Archdeaconry of Cornwall]]. The first Archdeacon was Reginald Hobhouse and he was succeeded by Archdeacon duBoulay in the 1890s. DuBoulay retired in 1924 and was replaced by M. B. Williamson who served until his death in 1939. The next archdeacon was W. H. Rigg and in 1953 the assistant bishop [[John Wellington]] became additionally Archdeacon of Bodmin.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, H. M. (1976) ''A Century for Cornwall''. Truro: Blackford; pp. 18, 26, 89, 101, 103, 118&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sites of interest==
===Institutions===
[[Bodmin Gaol|'''''Bodmin Gaol''''']], operational for over 150 years but now a semi-ruin, was built in the late 18th century, and was the first British prison to hold prisoners in separate cells (though often up to 10 at a time) rather than communally. Over fifty prisoners condemned at the Bodmin [[Assize Court]] were hanged at the prison. It was also used for temporarily holding prisoners sentenced to transportation, awaiting transfer to the prison hulks lying in the highest navigable reaches of the [[River Fowey]]. Also, during [[World War I]] the prison held some of Britain's priceless national treasures including the [[Domesday Book]], the ring and the [[Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom]].

The '''''Bodmin Beacon Local Nature Reserve''''' is the hill overlooking the town. The reserve has 83 acres (33.6&amp;nbsp;ha) of public land and at its highest point it reaches 162 metres with the distinctive landmark at the summit. The 44-metre tall monument to Sir [[Walter Raleigh Gilbert]]&lt;ref&gt;Chichester, H. M. (2004) ‘Gilbert, Sir Walter Raleigh, first baronet (1785–1853)’, rev. Roger T. Stearn, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/10704  accessed 1 Jan 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; was built in 1857 by the townspeople of Bodmin to honour the soldier's life and work in India.

In 1966, the ''&quot;Finn VC Estate&quot;'' was named in honour of [[Victoria cross]] winner [[James Henry Fynn|James Henry Finn]] who once lived in the town. Langdon (1896) records six crosses in the parish of which the finest is at Carminow. An ornate granite drinking bowl which serves the needs of thirsty dogs at the entrance to Bodmin’s Priory car park was donated by Prince [[Chula Chakrabongse]] of Thailand who lived at Tredethy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.busby.net/nzca/NZCA_NLvol380Jan09.pdf|title=New Zealand Cornish Association newsletter|accessdate=2009-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
There are no [[independent schools]] in the area.

===Primary schools===
[[Saint Petroc|St. Petroc]]'s [[Voluntary Aided]] [[Church of England]] [[Primary School]][http://www.st-petrocs.cornwall.sch.uk] Athelstan Park, Bodmin, [[Cornwall]] was given this title in September 1990 after the [[wiktionary:amalgamation|amalgamation]] of St. Petroc's [[Infant School]] and St. Petroc's Junior School. St. Petroc's is a large school with some 440 pupils between the ages of four and 11. Eight of its 14 governors are nominated by the [[Diocese of Truro]] or the [[Parochial]] Church Council of St. Petroc's, Bodmin.

There are a further three [[Primary school|primary]] (or [[Elementary school|elementary]]) schools within Bodmin; Berrycoombe School in the north west corner of the town, [[Saint Mary|St. Mary]]'s [[Catholic school|Catholic Primary School]] and [[John Robartes, 1st Earl of Radnor|Robartes]] Primary [[Junior School]], both situated west of the town centre.

==Official events==
On Halgaver Moor (Goats' Moor) near Bodmin there was once an annual carnival in July which was on one occasion attended by King Charles II.&lt;ref&gt;Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bodmin Riding]] is a traditional annual ceremony.

==='Beating the bounds' and 'hurling'===
In 1865–66 [[William Robert Hicks]] was mayor of Bodmin, when he revived the custom of [[Beating the bounds]] of the town. He was — according to the [[Dictionary of National Biography]] — a very good man of business. This still takes place more or less every five years and concludes with a game of [[Cornish hurling]]. Hurling survives as a traditional part of beating the bounds at Bodmin, commencing at the close of the 'Beat'. The game is organised by the [[Rotary club]] of Bodmin and was last played in 2010. The game is started by the Mayor of Bodmin by throwing a silver ball into a body of water known as the &quot;Salting Pool&quot;. There are no teams and the hurl follows a set route. The aim is to carry the ball from the &quot;Salting Pool&quot; via the old [[A30 road|A30]], along Callywith Road, then through Castle Street, Church Square and Honey Street to finish at the Turret Clock in Fore Street. The participant carrying the ball when it reaches the turret clock will receive a £10 reward from the mayor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rotary-ribi.org/clubs/page.asp?PgID=134388&amp;ClubID=1019 2010 Bodmin Hurl Rules], ''Rotary Club of Bodmin'', 02/04/2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The next occurrence of the Bodmin Hurl will be following the next beating of the bounds, which is unlikely to take place until 2015.

'''Bodmin Moor''' ({{lang-kw|'''Goen Bren'''}}&lt;ref&gt;http://homepage.univie.ac.at/albert.bock/files/placenames.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[granite]] [[moorland]] in northeastern [[Cornwall]], England, United Kingdom. It is {{convert|208|km2|sqmi}} in size, and originally dates from the [[Carboniferous]] period of [[geology|geological]] history. 

Bodmin Moor is one of five [[granite]] [[plutons]] in Cornwall that make up part of the [[Cornubian batholith]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://petrology.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/27/3/571] Charoy, B. (1986) ''Genesis of the Cornubian Batholith (South West England): the example of the Carnmenellis Pluton'' in: ''Journal of Petrology''; 1986 Oxford: OUP&lt;/ref&gt; (see also [[Geology of Cornwall]]).

The name 'Bodmin Moor' is relatively recent, being an [[Ordnance Survey]] invention of 1813. It was formerly known as '''Fowey Moor''' after the [[River Fowey]] which rises within it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A History of the English Parish: the culture of religion from Augustine to Victoria | first= Norman John Greville |last= Pounds| publisher= Cambridge University Press | year= 2000 | isbn= 9780521633512 | pages= 593}}; p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
Dramatic granite [[tor (geography)|tors]] rise from the rolling moorland: the best known are [[Brown Willy]], the highest point in Cornwall at {{convert|417|m|ft|abbr=on}},&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.genuki.org.uk/big/eng/Cornwall/ GENUKI: Cornwall&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Rough Tor]] at {{convert|400|m|ft|abbr=on}}. To the south-east Kilmar Tor and [[Caradon Hill]] are the most prominent hills. Considerable areas of the moor are poorly drained and form marshes (in hot summers these can dry out). The rest of the moor is mostly rough pasture or overgrown with heather and other low vegetation.

The Moor contains about 500 holdings with around 10,000 beef cows, 55,000 breeding ewes and 1,000 horses and ponies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bodminmoor.co.uk/history.html The Bodmin Moor Pages ~ The History]&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the moor is a [[Site of Special Scientific Interest]] (SSSI) and has been officially designated an [[Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]] (AONB), as part of Cornwall AONB.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cornwall-aonb.gov.uk/documents/12_bodmin_character.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rivers and inland waters===

[[File:Stream below Garrow Tor - geograph.org.uk - 29683.jpg|thumb|The De Lank River at Garrow Tor]]
Bodmin Moor is the source of several of Cornwall's rivers: they are mentioned here anti-clockwise from the south. 

The [[River Fowey]] rises at a height of {{convert|290|m|ft|abbr=on}} and flows through [[Lostwithiel]] and into the [[Fowey]] estuary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cornwallriversproject.org.uk/geography/fowey.htm Cornwall Rivers Project|Geography | Fowey and Lerryn&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  

The [[River Tiddy]] rises near Pensilva and flows southeast to its confluence with the [[River Lynher]] (the Lynher flows generally south-east until it joins the [[Hamoaze]] near Plymouth). The [[River Inny, Cornwall|River Inny]] rises near [[Davidstow]] and flows southeast to its confluence with the River Tamar. 

The [[River Camel]] rises on Hendraburnick Down and flows for approximately {{convert|40|km|mi|abbr=on}} before joining the sea at [[Padstow]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cornwallriversproject.org.uk/geography/camel.htm Cornwall Rivers Project | Geography | Camel and Allen&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The River Camel and its tributary the [[De Lank River]] are an important habitat for the otter and both have been proposed as Special Areas of Conservation (SAC)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bodminmoor.co.uk/rivers.html The Rivers of Bodmin Moor - The Bodmin Moor Pages&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The De Lank River rises near [[Roughtor]] and flows along an irregular course before joining the Camel south of Wenford. 

The River Warleggan rises near [[Temple, Cornwall|Temple]] and flows south to join the Fowey.

On the southern slopes of the moor lies [[Dozmary Pool]]. It is Cornwall's only natural inland lake and is glacial in origin. In the 20th century three reservoirs have been constructed on the moor; these are [[Colliford Lake]], [[Siblyback Lake]] and [[Crowdy Reservoir|Crowdy reservoir]]s which supply water for a large part of the county's population. Various species of waterfowl are resident around these waters.&lt;ref&gt;Bere, Rennie (1982) ''The Nature of Cornwall''. Buckingham: Barracuda Books, pp. 63-67&lt;/ref&gt;

== History and antiquities==
=== Prehistoric times ===
[[Image:King arthurs hall.JPG|thumb|right|[[King Arthur's Hall]]]]
[[File:Kilmar Tor - geograph.org.uk - 7112.jpg|Kilmar Tor|thumb]]
10,000 years ago, in the [[Mesolithic]] period, [[hunter-gatherers]] wandered the moor when it was wooded and had a temperate climate. There are several documented cases of flint scatters being discovered by [[archaeology|archaeologists]], indicating that these hunter gatherers practised [[flint knapping]] in the region.&lt;ref&gt;Tilley, C. (1996) &quot;The Power of Rocks: landscape and topography on Bodmin Moor&quot;, in: ''World Archaeology''; 28, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; 

During the [[Neolithic]] era, from about 4,500 to 2,300 BC, people began clearing trees and farming the land. It was also in this era that the production of various [[megaliths|megalithic]] monuments began, predominantly long [[cairn|cairns]] (three of which have currently been identified, at Louden, Catshole and Bearah) and [[stone circles]] (sixteen of which have been identified). It was also likely that the naturally forming [[tor]]s were also viewed in a similar manner to the manmade ceremonial sites.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tilley, C 1996&quot;&gt;Tilley, C. (1996) &quot;The Power of Rocks: landscape and topography on Bodmin Moor&quot;, in: ''World Archaeology''; 28, pp. 151-176&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following [[Bronze Age]], the creation of monuments increased dramatically, with the production of over 300 further cairns, and more stone circles and stone rows.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tilley, C 1996&quot;/&gt; More than 200 [[Bronze Age]] settlements with [[Enclosure (archaeology)|enclosures]] and field patterns have been recorded.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/T/timeteam/2007_bod_t.html channel4.com - Time Team - Bodmin Moor, Cornwall - text only&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and many prehistoric stone [[tumulus|barrows]] and [[stone circle|circles]] lie scattered across the moor.  In a programme shown in 2007 [[Channel 4]]'s ''[[Time Team]] ''investigated a 500 metre cairn and the site of a Bronze Age village on the slopes of [[Rough Tor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/T/timeteam/2007_bod_found.html|title=Bodmin Moor, Cornwall|date=8 April 2007|work=Channel 4: Time Team|accessdate=2009-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[King Arthur's Hall]] thought to be a late [[Neolithic]] or early [[Bronze Age]] ceremonial site can be found to the east of [[St Breward]] on the moor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whitedragon.org.uk/articles/secretcornwall.htm Secret Cornwall; Bodmin Moor and its environs&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Medieval and modern times ===
[[File:Hawk's Tor.jpg|thumb|Hawk's Tor, north of Temple]]
Where practicable areas of the moor were used for pasture by herdsmen from the parishes surrounding the moor. Granite boulders were also taken from the moor and used for stone posts and to a certain extent for building (such material is known as moorstone).&lt;ref&gt;Clifton-Taylor, A. &quot;Building materials&quot; in: Pevsner, N. (1970) ''Cornwall''. 2nd ed. Penguin Books, p. 29-34&lt;/ref&gt; Granite quarrying only became reasonably productive when gunpowder became available.

The moor gave its name (Foweymore) to one of the medieval districts called [[Stannary|stannaries]] which administered tin mining: the boundaries of these were never defined precisely. Until the establishment of a turnpike road through the moor (the present [[A30 road|A30]]) in the 1770s the size of the moorland area made travel within Cornwall very difficult.

Its Cornish name, Goen Bren, is first recorded in the 12th century.&lt;ref&gt;Weatherhill, Craig (2009) ''A Concise Dictionary of Cornish Place-names''. Westport, co. Mayo: Evertype; p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

===Monuments and ruins===
Roughtor was the site of a medieval chapel of St Michael and is now designated as a memorial to the [[43rd (Wessex) Infantry Division|43rd Wessex Division]] of the British Army. In 1844 on Bodmin Moor the body of 18 year old Charlotte Dymond was discovered. Local labourer Matthew Weeks was accused of the murder and at noon on 12 August 1844 he was led from [[Bodmin Gaol]] and hanged. The murder site now has a monument erected from public money and the grave is at  [[Davidstow]] churchyard.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parmaq.com/truecrime/CharlotteDymond.htm The Murder of Charlotte Dymond]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legends and traditions==
[[Dozmary Pool]] is identified by some people with the lake in which, according to [[King Arthur|Arthurian]] legend, [[Bedivere|Sir Bedivere]] threw [[Excalibur]] to [[The Lady of the Lake]].&lt;ref&gt;''Cornish Archaeology''; No 34, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; Another legend relating to the pool concerns [[Jan Tregeagle]].

The [[Beast of Bodmin]] has been reported many times but never identified with certainty.

'''Berkeley''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|b|ɜr|k|l|iː}} {{respell|BURK|lee}}) is a city on the east shore of the [[San Francisco Bay]] in [[Northern California]], [[United States]]. Its neighbors to the south are the cities of [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] and [[Emeryville, California|Emeryville]]. To the north is the city of [[Albany, California|Albany]] and the [[unincorporated area|unincorporated]] community of [[Kensington, California|Kensington]]. The eastern city limits coincide with the county line (bordering [[Contra Costa County, California|Contra Costa County]]), which generally follows the ridge line of the [[Berkeley Hills]]. Berkeley is located in northern [[Alameda County, California|Alameda County]].

Berkeley is the site of the [[University of California, Berkeley]], the oldest of the [[University of California]] system, and the [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]]. It is also home to the [[Graduate Theological Union]]. The city is noted as one of the most [[Modern liberalism in the United States|politically liberal]] in the nation, with one study placing it as the third most liberal city in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==History==
===Early history===
The site of today's City of Berkeley was the territory of the Chochen/Huichin band of the [[Ohlone]] people when the first Europeans arrived.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Remnants of their existence in the area include pits in rock formations, which they used to grind acorns, and a [[shellmound]], now mostly leveled and covered up, along the shoreline of [[San Francisco Bay]] at the mouth of [[Strawberry Creek]]. Other artifacts were discovered in the 1950s in the [[Downtown Berkeley|downtown area]] during remodeling of a commercial building, near the upper course of the creek.

[[File:Acorn pit at Indian Rock.jpg|thumb|left|100px|This pit in the surface of a rock at [[Indian Rock Park]] is typical of those used by [[Ohlone]] Indians to grind [[acorn]]s.]]
The first people of European descent (most of whom were born in America, and many of whom were of mixed ancestry) arrived with the [[De Anza Expedition]] in 1776. Today, this is noted by signage on [[Interstate 80 (California)|Interstate 80]], which runs along the San Francisco Bay shoreline of Berkeley. The De Anza Expedition led to establishment of the Spanish [[Presidio of San Francisco]] at the entrance to San Francisco Bay (the ''[[Golden Gate]]),'' which is due west of Berkeley. [[Luís María Peralta|Luís Peralta]] was among the soldiers at the Presidio. For his services to the [[King of Spain]], he was granted a vast stretch of land on the east shore of San Francisco Bay (the ''contra costa'', &quot;opposite shore&quot;) for a ranch, including that portion that now comprises the City of Berkeley.

Luís Peralta named his holding, &quot;[[Rancho San Antonio (Peralta)|Rancho San Antonio]].&quot; The primary activity of the ranch was raising cattle for meat and hides, but hunting and farming were also pursued. Eventually, Peralta gave portions of the ranch to each of his four sons. What is now Berkeley lies mostly in the portion that went to Peralta's son, [[José Domingo Peralta|Domingo]], with a little in the portion that went to another son, Vicente. No artifact survives of the ranches of Domingo or Vicente, although their names have been preserved in the naming of Berkeley streets (Vicente, Domingo, and Peralta). However, legal title to all land in the City of Berkeley remains based on the original Peralta land grant.

The Peraltas' Rancho San Antonio continued after [[Alta California]] passed from Spanish to Mexican sovereignty after the [[Mexican War of Independence]]. However, the advent of U.S. sovereignty after the [[Mexican–American War]], and especially, the [[California Gold Rush|Gold Rush]], saw the Peralta's lands quickly encroached on by [[squatter]]s and diminished by dubious legal proceedings. The lands of the brothers Domingo and Vicente were quickly reduced to reservations close to their respective ranch homes. The rest of the land was surveyed and parceled out to various American claimants (''See'' [[Kellersberger's Map]]).

[[File:Indian rock.jpg|thumb|San Francisco from Indian Rock]]Politically, the area that became Berkeley was initially part of a vast [[Contra Costa County]]. On March 25, 1853, Alameda County was created by division of Contra Costa County, as well as from a small portion of [[Santa Clara County]].

The area of Berkeley was at this period mostly a mix of open land, farms and ranches, with a small though busy wharf by the bay. It was not yet &quot;Berkeley,&quot; but merely the northern part of the &quot;Oakland Township&quot; subdivision of Alameda County.

===Late 19th century===
In 1866, Oakland's private [[College of California]] looked for a new site. It settled on a location north of Oakland along the foot of the [[Berkeley Hills|Contra Costa Range]] (later called the Berkeley Hills) astride [[Strawberry Creek]], at an elevation about {{convert|500|ft}} above the bay, commanding a fantastic view of the Bay Area and the Pacific Ocean through the [[Golden Gate]].

According to the ''Centennial Record of the University of California'', &quot;In 1866…at [[Founders' Rock]], a group of College of California men watched two ships standing out to sea through the [[Golden Gate]]. One of them, [[Frederick Billings]], thought of the lines of the [[Anglo-Irish]] [[Anglican]] [[George Berkeley|Bishop George Berkeley]], 'westward the course of empire takes its way,' and suggested that the town and college site be named for the eighteenth-century Anglo-Irish philosopher and poet.&quot;

The College of California's ''College Homestead Association'' planned to raise funds for the new campus by selling off parcels of land adjacent to it. To this end, they laid out a plat and street grid that became the basis of Berkeley's modern street plan. Their plans fell far short of their desires, and collaboration was then begun with the State of California, which culminated in 1868 with the creation of the public [[University of California]].

As construction began on the new site, more residences were constructed in the vicinity of the new campus. At the same time, a settlement of residences, saloons, and various industries grew around the wharf area called &quot;[[Ocean View, Berkeley, California|Ocean View]].&quot; A [[horsecar]] ran from [[Temescal, Oakland, California|Temescal]] in Oakland to the university campus along what is now [[Telegraph Avenue]].

By the 1870s, the [[Transcontinental Railroad]] reached its terminus in Oakland. In 1876, a branch line of the [[Central Pacific Railroad]], the [[Berkeley Branch Railroad]], was laid from a junction with the mainline called Shellmound (now a part of Emeryville) into what is now [[Downtown Berkeley, California|downtown Berkeley]]. That same year, the mainline of the transcontinental railroad into Oakland was re-routed, putting the right-of-way along the bay shore through Ocean View.

There was a strong prohibition movement in Berkeley at this time. In 1876 the &quot;mile limit law&quot; was passed, which prevented sale or public consumption of alcohol within one mile (1.6&amp;nbsp;km) of the new University of California.&lt;ref&gt;Berkeley Gazette. 1900 April 9&lt;/ref&gt; Then, in 1899 Berkeley residents voted to make their city an alcohol-free zone. Scientists, scholars and religious leaders spoke vehemently of the dangers of alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;Berkeley 1900: Daily Life at the Turn of the Century, by Richard Schwartz. 2000. page 187&lt;/ref&gt;

The first post office opened in 1872.&lt;ref name=CGN&gt;{{California's Geographic Names|601}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1878, the people of Ocean View and the area around the University campus, together with local farmers, incorporated themselves as the Town of Berkeley. The first elected trustees of the town were the slate of [[Denis Kearney]]'s [[Workingman's Party]], who were particularly favored in the working class area of the former Ocean View, now called &quot;West Berkeley.&quot; The area near the university became known as &quot;East Berkeley.&quot;

The modern age came quickly to Berkeley, no doubt due to the influence of the university. [[Electric light]]s were in use by 1888. The [[telephone]] had already come to town. Electric [[streetcar]]s soon replaced the [[horsecar]]. A silent film of one of these early streetcars in Berkeley can be seen at the [[Library of Congress]] website: [http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/papr:@filreq(@field(NUMBER+@band(lcmp003+m3a29754))+@field(COLLID+sanfran)) &quot;A Trip To Berkeley, California&quot;]

===Early 20th century===
Berkeley's slow growth ended abruptly with the [[1906 San Francisco Earthquake|Great San Francisco Earthquake of 1906]]. The town and other parts of the East Bay somehow managed to escape serious damage from the massive temblor, and thousands of refugees flowed across the Bay.

In 1908, a statewide referendum that proposed moving the California state capital to Berkeley was defeated by a margin of about 33,000 votes.&lt;ref&gt;''Exactly Opposite the Golden Gate'', edited by Phil McCardle, published 1983 by the Berkeley Historical Society, p.251&lt;/ref&gt; A legacy of this ballot measure that survives was the naming of streets in the vicinity of the proposed capitol grounds for the counties of California.

In 1909, the citizens of Berkeley adopted a new charter, and the Town of Berkeley became the City of Berkeley. Rapid growth continued up to the [[Crash of 1929]]. The [[Great Depression]] hit Berkeley hard, but not as hard as many other places in the U.S., thanks in part to the University.

On September 17, 1923, [[1923 Berkeley Fire|a major fire]] swept down the hills toward the University campus and the downtown section. Some 640 structures burned before a late afternoon sea breeze stopped its progress, allowing firefighters to put it out.

The next big growth occurred with the advent of [[World War II]], when large numbers of people moved to the Bay Area to work in the many war industries, such as the immense [[Kaiser Shipyards]] in nearby [[Richmond, California|Richmond]]. One who moved out, but played a big role in the outcome of the War was U.C. Professor and Berkeley resident [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]]. During the war, an Army base, [[Camp Ashby]], was temporarily sited in Berkeley.

===1950s and 1960s===
{{Expand section|date=July 2008}}
The postwar years saw moderate growth of the City, as events on the U.C. campus began to build up to the recognizable activism of the sixties. In the 1950s, [[McCarthyism]] induced the University to demand a loyalty oath from its professors, many of whom refused to sign the oath on the principle of freedom of thought. In 1960, a U.S. House committee ([[HUAC]]) came to San Francisco to investigate the influence of communists in the Bay Area. Their presence was met by protesters, including many from the University. Meanwhile, a number of U.C. students became active in support of the [[Civil Rights Movement]]. Finally, the University in 1964 provoked a massive student protest by banning distribution of political literature on campus. This protest became the [[Free Speech Movement]]. As the [[Vietnam War]] rapidly escalated in the ensuing years, so did student activism at the University, particularly that organized by the [[Vietnam Day Committee]].

Berkeley is strongly identified with the rapid social changes, civic unrest, and political upheaval that characterized the late 1960s. In that period, Berkeley—especially Telegraph Avenue—became a focal point for the [[hippie]] movement, which spilled over the Bay from San Francisco. Many hippies were apolitical drop-outs, rather than students, but in the heady atmosphere of Berkeley in 1967–1969 there was considerable overlap of the hippie movement and the radical left. An iconic event in the Berkeley Sixties scene was a conflict over a parcel of University property south of the contiguous campus site that came to be called &quot;[[People's Park, Berkeley|People's Park]].&quot;

[[Image:People's-Park.jpg|thumbnail|left|People's Park with Unit 2 in the background]]

The battle over disposition of People's Park resulted in a month-long occupation of Berkeley by the [[United States National Guard|National Guard]] on orders of then-Governor [[Ronald Reagan]]. In the end, the park remained undeveloped, and remains so today. A spin-off, &quot;People's Park Annex,&quot; was established at the same time by activist citizens of Berkeley on a strip of land above the [[Bay Area Rapid Transit]] subway construction along Hearst Avenue northwest of the U.C. campus. The land had also been intended for development, but was turned over to the City by BART and is now [[Ohlone Park]].

===1970s to present===
[[File:Berkeley BART Station 1973 Postcard.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Shattuck Avenue at Center Street in downtown Berkeley as seen in 1973]]
{{Expand section|date=July 2008}}
The 1970s saw a decline in the population of Berkeley, partly due to an exodus to the suburbs. Some moved because of the rising cost of living throughout the Bay Area, and others because of the decline and disappearance of many industries in West Berkeley.

From the 1980s to the present, Berkeley has seen rising housing costs, especially since the mid-1990s. In 2005–2007, sales of homes began to slow, but average home prices, as of 2010, remain among the highest in the nation.

While the 1960s were the heyday of liberal activism in Berkeley, it remains one of the most overwhelmingly Democratic cities in the United States. The era of large public protest in Berkeley waned considerably with the end of the Vietnam War in 1974. One person who rose in prominence during the late sixties and into the seventies was [[Ron Dellums]], a self-described [[Democratic socialism|socialist]] and nephew of [[C.L. Dellums]], an African-American labor leader. He first served on the Berkeley City Council, and later became a federal representative for the district that includes Berkeley. He was elected Mayor of Oakland in 2006.

In 2006, the [[Berkeley Oak Grove Protest]] began protesting construction of a new sports center annex to Memorial Stadium at the expense of a grove of oak trees on the UC campus. The protest ended in September 2008 after a lengthy court process.

In 2007–08, Berkeley received media attention due to demonstrations against a Marine Corps recruiting office in downtown Berkeley and a series of controversial motions by Berkeley's City Council regarding opposition to Marine recruiting. (''See'' [[Berkeley Marine Corps Recruiting Center controversy]].)

==Geography==
Berkeley is located at {{Coord|37|52|18|N|122|16|29|W|type:city}} (37.871775, −122.274603).{{GR|1}}
[[Image:SF Bay from Berkeley.jpg|right|thumb|View of Berkeley and the San Francisco Bay from the [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]].]]
[[Image:BerkeleyAndBayAtNight.jpg|right|thumb|View of Berkeley and the San Francisco Bay at nightfall.]]

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|17.7|sqmi}}. {{convert|10.5|sqmi}} of it is land and {{convert|7.2|sqmi}} of it (40.9%) is water, most of it part of [[San Francisco Bay]].

Berkeley borders the cities of Albany, Oakland, and Emeryville and Contra Costa County including unincorporated Kensington as well as San Francisco Bay.

Berkeley lies within telephone [[area code]] 510 (historically, part of 415), and the postal [[ZIP code]]s are 94701 through 94710, 94712, and 94720 for the [[University of California]] campus.

==Geology==
Most of Berkeley lies on a rolling sedimentary plain that rises gently from sea level to the base of the [[Berkeley Hills]]. From there, the land rises dramatically. The highest peak along the ridge line above Berkeley is [[Grizzly Peak (Berkeley Hills)|Grizzly Peak]], elevation {{convert|1754|ft}}. A number of small creeks run from the hills to the Bay through Berkeley: [[Cerrito Creek|Cerrito]], [[Codornices Creek|Codornices]], [[Schoolhouse Creek|Schoolhouse]] and [[Strawberry Creek|Strawberry]] Creeks are the principal streams. Most of these are largely culverted once they reach the plain west of the hills.

The Berkeley Hills are part of the [[Pacific Coast Ranges]], and run in a northwest–southeast alignment. In Berkeley, the hills consist mainly of a soft, crumbly rock with outcroppings of harder material of old (and extinct) volcanic origin. These [[rhyolite]] formations can be seen in several city parks and in the yards of a number of private residences. [[Indian Rock Park]] in the northeastern part of Berkeley near the Arlington/Marin Circle features a large example.

Berkeley is traversed by the [[Hayward Fault]], a major branch of the [[San Andreas Fault]] to the west. No large earthquake has occurred on the Hayward Fault near Berkeley in historic times (except possibly in 1836), but seismologists warn about the geologic record of large temblors several times in the deeper past, and their current assessment is that a quake of 6.5 or greater is imminent, sometime within the next 30 years.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

[[Image:Berkeley Indian Rock.JPG|left|thumb|300px|The view from Indian Rock]]
The [[1868 Hayward earthquake]] did occur on the southern segment of the Hayward Fault&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9801E5DB1E3CE13BBC4A51DFB6678383679FDE |newspaper=New York Times |date=October 22, 1868 |title=Earthquake in San Francisco and Neighboring Places }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the vicinity of today's city of [[Hayward, California|Hayward]] (hence, how the fault got its name). This quake destroyed the county seat of Alameda County then located in [[San Leandro, California|San Leandro]] and it subsequently moved to Oakland. It was strongly felt in San Francisco, causing major damage, and experienced by Samuel Clemens ([[Mark Twain]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://etext.virginia.edu/etcbin/toccer-new2?id=TwaRoug.sgm&amp;images=images/modeng&amp;data=/texts/english/modeng/parsed&amp;tag=public&amp;part=58&amp;division=div1 http://etext.virginia.edu/etcbin/toccer-new2?id=TwaRoug.sgm&amp;images=images/modeng&amp;data=/texts/english/modeng/parsed&amp;tag=public&amp;part=58&amp;division=div1] ''etext.virginia.edu''&lt;/ref&gt; It was regarded as the &quot;Great San Francisco Quake&quot; prior to 1906. The quake produced a furrow in the ground along the fault line in Berkeley, across the grounds of the new [[State Asylum for the Deaf, Dumb and Blind]] then under construction, which was noted by one early University of California professor. Though no significant damage was reported to most of the few Berkeley buildings of the time, the 1868 quake did destroy the vulnerable adobe home of Domingo Peralta in north Berkeley.&lt;ref&gt;Lawson, A. C. (ed.), “The California Earthquake of April 18, 1906”, 1908, Reprinted 1969 by the Carnegie Institution of Washington. This is a comprehensive report on the 1906 earthquake, published by the State Earthquake Investigation Commission, and comprises two volumes and an atlas. It contains a discussion of the 1868 Hayward Fault earthquake and its effects, and includes a number of photos taken by Lawson himself of damage in Berkeley caused by the 1906 quake. The report is available from the USGS here [http://earthquake.usgs.gov/regional/nca/1906/18april/references.php].
&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, evidence of the Hayward Fault's &quot;creeping&quot; is visible at various locations in Berkeley. Cracked roadways, sharp jogs in streams, and springs mark the fault's path. However, since it cuts across the base of the hills, the creep is often concealed by or confused with slide activity. Some of the slide activity itself, however, results from movement on the Hayward Fault.

A notorious segment of the Hayward Fault runs lengthwise down the middle of [[California Memorial Stadium|Memorial Stadium]] at the mouth of Strawberry Canyon on the University of California campus. [http://seismo.berkeley.edu/hayward/ucb_campus.html Photos and measurements] show the movement of the fault through the stadium.

==Climate==
Berkeley has a cool summer [[Mediterranean climate]] (Köppen climate classification Csb), with dry summers and wet winters. The summers are cooler than a typical Mediterranean climate thanks to [[upwelling]] ocean currents along the California coast. These help produce cool and [[fog]]gy nights and mornings. Berkeley's location directly opposite the [[Golden Gate]] ensures that typical eastward fog flow blankets the city more often than its neighbors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ephemeris.sjaa.net/0107/b.html Jane Houston Jones. ''San Francisco Weather – Weird and Wacky''. SJAA Ephemeris July 2001.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Winter is punctuated with rainstorms of varying ferocity and duration, but also produces stretches of bright sunny days and clear cold nights. It does not normally snow, though occasionally the hilltops get a dusting. Spring and fall are transitional and intermediate, with some rainfall and variable temperature. Summer typically brings night and morning low clouds or [[fog]], followed by sunny, warm days. The warmest and driest months are typically June through September, with the highest temperatures occurring in September. Mid-summer (July–August) is often a bit cooler due to the sea breezes and fog common then.

Average January temperatures are a maximum of {{convert|56.4|F|C}} and a minimum of {{convert|43.6|F|C}}. Average September (the warmest month) temperatures are a maximum of {{convert|71.7|F|C}} and a minimum of {{convert|55.9|F|C}}. In a year, there are an average of 2.9 days with highs of {{convert|90|F|C}} or higher, and an average of 0.8 days with lows of {{convert|32|F|C}} or lower. The highest recorded temperature was {{convert|107|F|C}} on June 15, 2000, and the lowest recorded temperature was {{convert|24|F|C}} on December 22, 1990.

January is normally the wettest month, averaging {{convert|5.13|in|mm}} of precipitation. Average annual precipitation is {{convert|25.40|in|mm}}, falling on an average of 63.7 days each year. The most rainfall in one month was {{convert|14.49|in|mm}} in February 1998. The most rainfall in 24 hours was {{convert|6.98|in|mm}} on January 4, 1982.&lt;ref&gt;http://cdo.ncdc.noaa.gov/climatenormals/clim20/ca/040693.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Light snow has fallen on rare occasions. Snow has generally fallen every several years on the higher peaks of the [[Berkeley Hills]].&lt;ref&gt;Western Regional Climate Center Web site&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late spring and early fall, strong offshore winds of sinking air typically develop, bringing heat and dryness to the area. In the spring, this is not usually a problem as vegetation is still moist from winter rains, but extreme dryness prevails by the fall, creating a danger of wildfires. In September 1923 a major fire swept through the neighborhoods north of the University campus, stopping just short of downtown. (''See'' [[1923 Berkeley fire]]). On October 20, 1991, gusty, hot winds fanned a conflagration along the Berkeley–Oakland border, killing 25 people and injuring 150, as well as destroying 2,449 single-family dwellings and 437 apartment and condominium units. (''See'' [[1991 Oakland firestorm]])

As of the [[census]]{{GR|2}} of 2000, there were 102,743 people, 44,955 households, and 18,656 families residing in the city. The [[population density]] was 9,823.3&lt;ref&gt;census bureau quick facts: http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/06/0606000.html&lt;/ref&gt; people per square mile (3,792.5/km²), one of the highest in California. There were 46,875 housing units at an average density of 4,481.8 per square mile (1,730.3/km²). The racial makeup of the city in 2010 was 54.7% non-Hispanic [[Race (United States Census)|White]], 9.7% non-Hispanic [[Race (United States Census)|Black]] or [[Race (United States Census)|African American]], 19.1% [[Race (United States Census)|Asian]], 0.2% [[Race (United States Census)|Native American]], 0.2% [[Race (United States Census)|Pacific Islander]], 0.4% from [[Race (United States Census)|other races]], and 4.9% from two or more races. 10.8% of the population were [[Race (United States Census)|Hispanic]] or [[Race (United States Census)|Latino]] of any race. 7.3% were of [[German people|German]], 7.2% [[English people|English]] and 6.3% [[Irish people|Irish]] ancestry according to [[Census 2000]]. 73.1% spoke [[English language|English]], 8.3% [[Spanish language|Spanish]], 4.5% [[Standard Chinese|Chinese]] or [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]], 1.6% [[french language|French]], 1.2% [[Korean language|Korean]], 1.1% [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and 1.0% [[German language|German]] as their first language.

There were 44,955 households, out of which 17.8% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 28.9% were married couples living together, 9.5% had a female householder with no husband present, and 58.5% were non-families and/or unmarried couples. 38.1% of all households were made up of individuals and 7.9% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.16 and the average family size was 2.84.

In the city the population was spread out with 14.1% under the age of 18, 21.6% from 18 to 24, 31.8% from 25 to 44, 22.3% from 45 to 64, and 10.2% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 32 years. For every 100 females there were 96.5 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 95.1 males.

According to a 2007 estimate, the median income for a household in the city was $57,189, and the median income for a family was $93,297.&lt;ref&gt;[http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/STTable?_bm=y&amp;-context=st&amp;-qr_name=ACS_2007_1YR_G00_S1901&amp;-ds_name=ACS_2007_1YR_G00_&amp;-CONTEXT=st&amp;-tree_id=307&amp;-redoLog=false&amp;-_caller=geoselect&amp;-geo_id=16000US0606000&amp;-format=&amp;-_lang=en http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/STTable?_bm=y&amp;-context=st&amp;-qr_name=ACS_2007_1YR_G00_S1901&amp;-ds_name=ACS_2007_1YR_G00_&amp;-CONTEXT=st&amp;-tree_id=307&amp;-redoLog=false&amp;-_caller=geoselect&amp;-geo_id=16000US0606000&amp;-format=&amp;-_lang=en] ''factfinder.census.gov''&lt;/ref&gt; Males had a median income of $50,789 versus $40,623 for females. The [[per capita income]] for the city was $30,477. About 8.3% of families and 20.0% of the population were below the [[poverty line]], including 13.4% of those under age 18 and 7.9% of those age 65 or over. Population is estimated to have reduced slightly since the 2000 census.&lt;ref name=&quot;Statistics of Berkeley, California&quot;&gt;[http://www.city-data.com/city/Berkeley-California.html Statistics of Berkeley, California], City Data.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transportation==
Berkeley is served by [[Amtrak]] ([[Capitol Corridor]]), [[AC Transit]], [[Bay Area Rapid Transit|BART]] ([[Downtown Berkeley Station]], [[North Berkeley (BART)|North Berkeley]], and [[Ashby (BART station)|Ashby]]) and bus shuttles operated by major employers including [[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley]] and [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]]. The [[Eastshore Freeway]] ([[Interstate 80 (California)|Interstate 80]] and [[Interstate 580 (California)|Interstate 580]]) runs along the bay shoreline. Each day there is an influx of thousands of cars into the city by commuting UC faculty, staff and students, making parking for more than a few hours an expensive proposition.

Berkeley has one of the highest rates of [[bicycle]] and pedestrian commuting in the nation. Berkeley is the safest city of its size in California for pedestrians and cyclists, considering the number of injuries per pedestrian and cyclist, rather than per capita.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ci.berkeley.ca.us/contentdisplay.aspx?id=8512 Bicycle and Pedestrian Safety in Berkeley], City of Berkeley.&lt;/ref&gt;

Berkeley has modified its original grid roadway structure through use of diverters and barriers, moving most traffic out of neighborhoods and onto arterial streets (visitors often find this confusing, because the diverters are not shown on all maps). Berkeley maintains a separate grid of arterial streets for bicycles, called [[Bicycle Boulevards]], with bike lanes and lower amounts of car traffic than the major streets they often parallel.

Berkeley hosts [[car sharing]] networks run by City CarShare, [[U Car Share]], and [[Zipcar]]. Rather than owning (and parking) their own cars, members share a group of cars parked nearby. Web- and telephone-based reservation systems keep track of hours and charges. Several &quot;pods&quot; (points of departure where cars are kept) exist throughout the city, in several downtown locations, at the Ashby and North Berkeley BART stations, and at various other locations in Berkeley (and other cities in the region). Using alternative transportation is encouraged.

Berkeley has had recurring problems with [[parking meter]] vandalism. In 1999, over 2,400 Berkeley meters were jammed, smashed, or sawed apart.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2004/01/25/BAG664HDH31.DTL “Chicanery tops meters in Berkeley”], ''San Francisco Chronicle''.&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in 2005 and continuing into 2006, Berkeley began to phase out mechanical meters in favor of more centralized electronic meters.

===Transportation past===
The first commuter service to San Francisco was provided by the [[Central Pacific Railroad|Central Pacific]]'s [[Berkeley Branch Railroad]], a [[standard gauge]] [[steam railroad]], which terminated in downtown Berkeley, and connected in Emeryville (at a locale then known as &quot;Shellmound&quot;) with trains to the [[Oakland Long Wharf|Oakland ferry pier]] as well as with the Central Pacific main line starting in 1876. The Berkeley Branch line was extended from Shattuck and University to Vine Street (&quot;Berryman's Station&quot;) in 1878. Starting in 1882, Berkeley trains ran directly to the Oakland Pier.&lt;ref&gt;''Berkeley Gazette'', January 22, 1903&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1880s, [[Southern Pacific Railroad|Southern Pacific]] assumed operations of the Berkeley Branch. In 1911, Southern Pacific electrified this line and the several others it constructed in Berkeley, creating its [[East Bay Electric Lines]] division. The huge and heavy cars specially built for these lines came to be called the &quot;Red Trains&quot; or the &quot;Big Red Cars.&quot; The Shattuck line was extended and connected with two other Berkeley lines (the Ninth Street Line and the California Street line) at Solano and Colusa (the &quot;Colusa Wye&quot;). It was at this time that the [[Northbrae Tunnel]] and the Rose Street Undercrossing were constructed, both of which still exist (the Rose Street Undercrossing is not accessible to the public, being situated between what is now two backyards). The fourth Berkeley line was the Ellsworth St. line to the university campus. The last Red Trains ran in July, 1941.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ford |first=Robert S. |title=Red Trains in the East Bay: The History of the Southern Pacific Transbay Train and Ferry System |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=PT8fAQAAIAAJ |year=1977 |series=Interurbans Specials |volume=65 |publisher=[[Interurban Press]] |location=Glendale, California |isbn=0-916374-27-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first electric rail service in Berkeley was provided by several small [[streetcar]] companies starting in 1891. Most of these were eventually bought up by the [[Key System]] of [[Francis &quot;Borax&quot; Smith]] who added lines and improved equipment. The Key System's streetcars were operated by its East Bay Street Railways division. Principal lines in Berkeley ran on Euclid, The Arlington, College, Telegraph, Shattuck, San Pablo, University, and Grove (today's Martin Luther King Jr. Way). The last streetcars ran in 1948, replaced by buses.

The first electric commuter interurban-type trains to San Francisco from Berkeley were put in operation by the Key System in 1903, several years before the Southern Pacific electrified its steam commuter lines. Like the SP, Key trains ran to a pier serviced by the Key's own fleet of [[Ferries of San Francisco Bay|ferryboats]], which also docked at the Ferry Building in San Francisco. After the [[San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge|Bay Bridge]] was built, the Key trains ran to the [[Transbay Terminal]] in San Francisco, sharing tracks on the lower deck of the Bay Bridge with the SP's red trains and the [[Sacramento Northern]] Railroad. It was at this time that the Key trains acquired their letter designations, which were later preserved by Key's public successor, AC Transit. Today's F bus is the successor of the F train. Likewise, the E, G and the H. Before the Bridge, these lines were simply the Shattuck Avenue Line, the Claremont Line, the Westbrae Line, and the Sacramento Street Line, respectively.

After the Southern Pacific abandoned transbay service in 1941, the Key System acquired the rights to use its tracks and [[overhead lines|catenary]] on Shattuck north of Dwight Way and through the Northbrae Tunnel to The Alameda for the F-train. The SP tracks along Monterey Avenue as far as Colusa had been acquired by the Key System in 1933 for the H-train, but were abandoned in 1941. The Key System trains stopped running in April 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Demoro |first=Harre W. |title=The Key Route: Transbay Commuting by Train and Ferry, Part 1 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=p0wfAQAAIAAJ |year=1985 |series=Interurbans Specials |volume=95 |publisher=[[Interurban Press]] |location=Glendale, California |isbn=0-916374-66-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963, the Northbrae Tunnel was opened to auto traffic.

===Neighborhoods===
{{See also|List of Berkeley neighborhoods}}
[[File:UC Berkeley.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of UC campus and downtown Berkeley]]
Berkeley has a number of distinct neighborhoods.

Surrounding the [[University of California, Berkeley Campus Architecture|University of California campus]] are the most densely populated parts of the city. West of the campus is [[Downtown Berkeley, California|Downtown Berkeley]], the city's traditional commercial core; home of the [[civic center]], the city's only public [[Berkeley High School (California)|high school]], the busiest [[Downtown Berkeley Station|BART station]] in Berkeley, as well as a major transfer point for [[AC Transit]] buses. South of the campus is the [[Southside, Berkeley, California|Southside]] neighborhood, mainly a [[student ghetto]], where much of the university's [[UC Berkeley student housing|student housing]] is located. The busiest stretch of [[Telegraph Avenue]] is in this neighborhood. North of the campus is the quieter [[Northside, Berkeley, California|Northside]] neighborhood, the location of the [[Graduate Theological Union]].

Further from the university campus, the influence of the University quickly becomes less visible. Most of Berkeley's neighborhoods are primarily made up of detached houses, often with separate in-law units in the rear, although larger apartment buildings are also common in many neighborhoods. Commercial activities are concentrated along the major avenues and at important intersections. In the southeastern corner of the city is the [[Claremont, Oakland/Berkeley, California|Claremont District]], home to the [[Claremont Resort|Claremont Hotel]]; and the [[Elmwood, Berkeley, California|Elmwood District]], with a small shopping area on College Avenue. West of Elmwood is [[South Berkeley, Berkeley, California|South Berkeley]], known for its weekend [[flea market]] at the [[Ashby (BART station)|Ashby Station]]. West of (and including) San Pablo Avenue, a major commercial corridor, is [[West Berkeley, Berkeley, California|West Berkeley]], the historic commercial center of the city, and the former unincorporated town of [[Ocean View, Berkeley, California|Ocean View]]. West Berkeley contains the remnants of Berkeley's industrial area, much of which has been replaced by retail and office uses, as well as residential live/work loft space, with the decline of manufacturing in the United States.

The areas of South and West Berkeley are in the midst of redevelopment. Some residents have opposed redevelopment in this area.

Along the shoreline of San Francisco Bay at the foot of University Avenue is the [[Berkeley Marina]]. Nearby is Berkeley's [[Aquatic Park (Berkeley)|Aquatic Park]], featuring an artificial linear lagoon of San Francisco Bay. North of Downtown is the [[North Berkeley, Berkeley, California|North Berkeley]] neighborhood, which has been nicknamed the &quot;Gourmet Ghetto&quot; because of the concentration of well-known restaurants and other food-related businesses. Further north are [[Northbrae, Berkeley, California|Northbrae]], a master-planned subdivision from the early 20th century, and [[Thousand Oaks, Berkeley, California|Thousand Oaks]]. Above these last three neighborhoods, in the northeastern part of Berkeley, are the [[Berkeley Hills]]. The neighborhoods of the Berkeley Hills such as [[Cragmont, Berkeley|Cragmont]] and [[La Loma Park]] are notable for their dramatic views, winding streets, and numerous public stairways and paths.

==Parks and recreation==
The city has many parks puts a focus on greenery and the environment. The city has planted trees for years and led the effort nationwide to re-tree urban areas. The city's hills are covered by [[Tilden Regional Park]] much of which is in Richmond. The city is also heavily involved in creek restoration and wetlands restoration. The [[Berkeley Marina]] and [[East Shore State Park]] flank its shoreline at [[San Francisco Bay]] and organizations like the [[Urban Creeks Council]] and [[Friends of the Five Creeks]] the former of which is headquartered in Berkeley support the riparian areas in the town and coastlines as well.

The public schools today are administered by the [[Berkeley Unified School District]]. In the 1960s, Berkeley was one of the earliest US cities to voluntarily desegregate, utilizing a system of buses, still in use. The city has only one public high school, [[Berkeley High School (California)|Berkeley High School (BHS)]], established in 1880. The Berkeley High campus was designated a historic district by the [[National Register of Historic Places]] on January 7, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;''Berkeley Daily Planet'', January 22–24, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; [[Saint Mary's College High School]], a Catholic school, has its street address in Berkeley, although most of the grounds and buildings are actually in neighboring Albany. Berkeley has 11 [[elementary schools]] and three [[middle schools]]. There is also the [[Bay Area Technology School]], the only school in the whole Bay Area to offer a technology- and science-based curriculum, with major connections to leading universities. In addition, [[Berkeley City College]] is a [[Junior college|community college]] in the [[Peralta Community College District]].

'''Bolventor''' ({{lang-kw|Bedhasbold}}) is a hamlet on [[Bodmin Moor]] in [[Cornwall]], [[United Kingdom]]. It is situated in [[Altarnun]] [[civil parishes in England|civil parish]] between [[Launceston, Cornwall|Launceston]] and [[Bodmin]].&lt;ref&gt;Ordnance Survey: Landranger map sheet 201 ''Plymouth &amp; Launceston'' ISBN 9780319231463&lt;/ref&gt;

Bolventor is the location of the famous [[Jamaica Inn]] coaching inn. It is bypassed by a [[dual carriageway]] section of the [[A30 road|A30]] trunk road; before the bypass was built the village straddled the A30 road.

[[Daphne du Maurier]], a former resident, chose Bolventor as the setting for her novel about Cornish [[smuggling|smugglers]] titled ''[[Jamaica Inn (novel)|Jamaica Inn]]''.  The inn that inspired the novel, [[Jamaica Inn]], has stood beside the main road through the village since 1547. It is now a tourist attraction in its own right and dominates the village. 

The small [[Church (building)|church]] (dedicated to the Holy Trinity) that lies to the east of the village closed some years ago. A mile from Bolventor there was a chapel of St Luke (from the 13th to the early 16th century): the font is now at the church of [[Tideford]].&lt;ref&gt;Cornish Church Guide (1925) Truro: Blackford; p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; Bolventor parish was established in 1846 (before that date the village was in St Neot parish) but has now been merged with [[Altarnun]]. 

The village is said to take its name from the &quot;Bold Venture&quot; that it must have appeared to build a farm in this moorland, but this is probably [[folk etymology]], as &quot;Bol-&quot; is a common prefix in Cornish placenames.

'''Bengal''' ({{lang-bn|বাংলা}} ''Bangla'' or {{lang|bn|বঙ্গ}} ''Bôngo'') is a historical and geographical region in the northeast region of the [[Indian Subcontinent]] at the apex of the [[Bay of Bengal]]. Today, it is mainly divided between the sovereign land of [[Bangladesh|People's Republic of Bangladesh]] (previously [[East Bengal]] / [[East Pakistan]]) and the [[States and territories of India|Indian state]] of [[West Bengal]], although some regions of the previous kingdoms of Bengal (during local monarchical regimes and [[British Empire|British rule]]) are now part of the neighboring Indian states of [[Bihar]], [[Jharkhand]], [[Assam]], [[Tripura]] and [[Orissa]]. The majority of Bengal is inhabited by [[Bengali people]] (বাঙালি ''Bangali'') who speak the [[Bengali language]] (বাংলা ''Bangla'').

The region of Bengal is one of the most densely populated regions on earth, with a population density exceeding 900/km². Most of the Bengal region lies in the low-lying [[Ganges]]–[[Brahmaputra]] River [[River delta|Delta]] or [[Ganges Delta]], the world's largest delta. In the southern part of the delta lies the [[Sundarbans]]&amp;mdash;the world's largest [[mangrove]] forest and home of the [[Bengal tiger]]. Though the population of the region is mostly rural and agrarian, two [[megacities]], [[Kolkata]] (previously Calcutta) and [[Dhaka]] (previously Dacca), are located in Bengal. The Bengal region is renowned for its rich literary and cultural heritage as well as its immense contribution to the socio-cultural uplift of Indian society in the form of the [[Bengal Renaissance]], and [[Revolutionary movement for Indian independence|revolutionary activities]] during the [[Indian independence movement]].

The exact origin of the word ''Bangla'' or Bengal is unknown, though it is believed to be derived from the Dravidian-speaking tribe ''Bang'' that settled in the area around the year 1000 BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;congress&quot;&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other accounts speculate that the name is derived from ''Banga''(বঙ্গ ''bôngo''), which came from the [[Austric]] word &quot;Bonga&quot; meaning the Sun-god. The word ''Banga'' and other words speculated to refer to Bengal (such as [[Anga]]) can be found in ancient Indian texts including the [[Veda]]s, [[Jaina]] texts, the [[Mahabharata]] and [[Purana]]s. The earliest reference to &quot;Bangala&quot; (বঙ্গাল ''bôngal'') has been traced in the Nesari plates (805 AD) of [[Rashtrakuta]] [[Govinda III]] which speak of [[Dharmapala of Bengal|Dharmapala]] as the king of Vangala.&lt;ref&gt;M.A. Amitabha Bhattacharyya, ''Historical Geography of Ancient and Early Mediaeval Bengal'', Sanskrit Pustak Bhandar, 1977, pp. 61–62.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some accounts claim that the word may derive from [[bhang]], a preparation of [[cannabis (spiritual use)|cannabis]] which is used in some religious ceremonies in Bengal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Robinson|first=Rowan |title=The great book of hemp|publisher=Inner Traditions |year=1995|page=107|url=http://books.google.com/?id=Qq-A4A0KB0kC&amp;pg=PA107|isbn=9780892815418}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/library/studies/inhemp/4chapt9.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern [[Bengali people]] are a blend of these people.  Smaller numbers of [[Pashtun people|Pathans]], [[Persian people|Persians]], [[Arab]]s and [[Turkic peoples|Turks]] also migrated to the region in the [[late Middle Ages]] while spreading Islam.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the arrival of [[Indo-Aryans]], the kingdoms of [[Anga]], [[Vanga]] and [[Magadha]] were formed by the 10th century BC, located in the Bihar and Bengal regions. Magadha was one of the four main kingdoms of [[India]] at the time of [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] and consisted of several [[Janapadas]].&lt;ref name=settlements/&gt; One of the earliest foreign references to Bengal is the mention of a land named [[Gangaridai]] by the [[Greeks]] around 100 BC, located in an area in Bengal.&lt;ref name=Gangaridai&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the 3rd to the 6th centuries AD, the kingdom of Magadha served as the seat of the [[Gupta Empire]].

The first recorded independent king of Bengal was [[Shashanka]], reigning around early 7th century.&lt;ref name=shashankabanglaped&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After a period of anarchy, the native [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] [[Pala Empire]] ruled the region for four hundred years, and expanded across much of the [[Indian subcontinent]] into [[Afghanistan]] during the reigns of [[Dharmapala of Bengal|Dharmapala]] and [[Devapala]]. The Pala dynasty was followed by the reign of the [[Hindu]] [[Saiva]] [[Sena dynasty]]. [[Islam]] made its first appearance in Bengal during the 12th century when [[Sufi]] missionaries arrived. Later, occasional Muslim raiders reinforced the process of conversion by building [[mosques]], [[madrassas]] and Sufi [[Khanqah]]. Beginning in 1202 a military commander from the [[Delhi Sultanate]], [[Muhammad Khilji|Bakhtiar Khilji]], overran [[Bihar]] and Bengal as far east as [[Rangpur, Bangladesh|Rangpur]], [[Bogra]] and the [[Brahmaputra River]]. Although he failed to bring Bengal under his control, the expedition managed to defeat [[Lakshman Sen]] and his two sons moved to a place then called [[Munshiganj District|Vikramapur]] (present-day [[Munshiganj District]]), where their diminished dominion lasted until the late 13th century.

During the 14th century, the former kingdom became known as the [[Sultanate of Bengal]], ruled intermittently with the [[Sultanate of Delhi]]. Hindu states continued to exist in the Southern and the Eastern parts of Bengal till the 1450s such as the [[Deva dynasty]]. Also, the Ganesha dynasty began with [[Raja Ganesha]] in 1414, but his successors converted to Islam. Bengal came once more under the control of Delhi as the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]]s conquered it in 1576. There were several independent Hindu states established in Bengal during the [[Mughal period]] like those of [[Pratapaditya|Maharaja Pratap Aditya]] of [[Jessore]] and [[Raja Sitaram Ray]] of [[Burdwan]]. These kingdoms contributed a lot to the economic and cultural landscape of Bengal. Extensive land reclamations in forested and marshy areas were carried out and intrastate trade as well as commerce were highly encouraged. These kingdoms also helped introduce new music, painting, dancing and sculpture into Bengali art-forms as well as many temples were constructed during this period. Militarily, these served as bulwarks against Portuguese and Burmese attacks. Many of these kingdoms are recorded to have fallen during the late 1700s. While [[Koch dynasty]] in the North, flourished during the period of 16th and the 17th centuries as well as weathered the Mughals also and survived till the advent of the British. 

In 1534, the Pashtun [[Sher Shah Suri]], or Farid Khan &amp;mdash; a man of incredible military and political skill &amp;mdash; succeeded in defeating the superior forces of the [[Mughals]] under [[Humayun]] at Chausa (1539) and [[Kannauj]] (1540). Sher Shah fought back and captured both [[Delhi]] and [[Agra]] and established a kingdom stretching far into [[Punjab region|Punjab]]. Sher Shah's administrative skill showed in his public works, including the [[Grand Trunk Road]] connecting [[Sonargaon]] in Bengal with [[Peshawar]] in the [[Hindu Kush]]. Sher Shah's rule ended with his death in 1545, although even in those five years his reign would have a powerful influence on Indian society, politics, and economics.                                     

Shah Suri's successors lacked his administrative skill, and quarreled over the domains of his empire. [[Humayun]], who then ruled a rump Mughal state, saw an opportunity and in 1554 seized [[Lahore]] and Delhi. When Humayun died in Jan.1556, [[Hemu]], also called [[Hem Chandra Vikramaditya]], the then Hindu Prime Minister-cum- Chief of Army, of the [[Sur dynasty]] had already won Bengal in the battle at Chapperghatta, killing Muhammad Shah the then ruler of Bengal. This was Hemu's 20th continuous win in North India.  Knowing of Humanyun's death, Hemu rushed to [[Delhi]] to win [[Agra]] and later on Delhi and established 'Hindu Raj' in North India on 6th Oct. 1556, after 300 years of Muslim rule, leaving Bengal to his Governor Shahbaz Khan. [[Akbar]], the greatest of the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] emperors, who defeated the [[Karani]] rulers of Bengal in 1576. Bengal became a Mughal [[subah]] and ruled through [[subahdar]]s (governors). [[Akbar]] exercised progressive rule and oversaw a period of prosperity (through trade and development) in Bengal and northern India.                                           

Bengal's trade and wealth impressed the Mughals that they called the region the &quot;''Paradise of the Nations''&quot;. Administration by governors appointed by the court of the [[Mughal Empire]] court (1575–1717) gave way to four decades of semi-independence under the [[Nawabs of Murshidabad]], who respected the nominal sovereignty of the [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]] in Delhi. The Nawabs granted permission to the [[French East India Company]] to establish a trading post at [[Chandernagore]] in 1673, and the [[British East India Company]] at [[Calcutta]] in 1690. The most notable among them is [[Murshid Quli Khan]], who was succeeded by [[Alivardi Khan]]. Around the early 1700s, the [[Maratha Empire]] led [[expeditions in Bengal]]. The leader of the expedition was [[Maratha]] [[Maharaja]] [[Raghoji I Bhonsle|Raghuji]] of [[Nagpur Kingdom|Nagpur]]. Raghoji was able to annex [[Orissa]] and parts of Bengal permanently as he successfully exploited the chaotic conditions prevailing in the region  after the death of their Governor [[Murshid Quli Khan]] in 1727.&lt;ref&gt;SNHM. Vol. II, pp.&amp;nbsp;209, 224.&lt;/ref&gt; The expeditions  resulted in Bengal becoming a tributary region of the [[Maratha]]s for a period of time. 

[[Portuguese empire|Portuguese]] traders arrived late in the fifteenth century, once [[Vasco da Gama]] reached India by sea in 1498. European influence grew until the [[British East India Company]] gained taxation rights in Bengal ''[[subah]]'', or province, following the [[Battle of Plassey]] in 1757, when [[Siraj ud-Daulah]], the last independent Nawab, was defeated by the British.&lt;ref name=sirajbanglaped&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Calcutta was named the capital of [[British Raj|British India]] in 1772. The [[Bengal Renaissance]] and [[Brahmo Samaj]] socio-cultural reform movements had great impact on the cultural and economic life of Bengal. The failed [[Indian rebellion of 1857]] started near Calcutta and resulted in transfer of authority to the [[British monarchy|British Crown]], administered by the [[Viceroy of India]].&lt;ref name=baxter2&gt;{{Harv|Baxter|1997|pp=30–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1905 and 1911, an [[Partition of Bengal (1905)|abortive attempt]] was made to divide the province of Bengal into two zones.&lt;ref name=baxter3&gt;{{Harv|Baxter|1997|pp=39–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bengal has played a major role in the [[Indian independence movement]], in which [[Revolutionary movement for Indian independence|revolutionary groups]] were dominant. Armed attempts to overthrow the [[British Raj]] reached a climax when [[Subhash Chandra Bose]] led the [[Indian National Army]] against the British.

[[West Bengal]], the western part of Bengal, became a state in India. In the 1960s and 1970s, severe power shortages, strikes and a violent [[Naxalite|Marxist-Naxalite]] movement damaged much of the state's infrastructure, leading to a period of economic stagnation.

Most of the Bengal region is in the low-lying [[Ganges]]–[[Brahmaputra]] River Delta or [[Ganges Delta]]. The Ganges Delta arises from the confluence of the rivers [[Ganges]], [[Brahmaputra River|Brahmaputra]], and [[Meghna River|Meghna]] rivers and their respective tributaries.

About 20,000 people live on chars. Chars are temporary islands formed by the deposition of sediments eroded off the banks of the Ganges in West Bengal which often disappear in the monsoon season. They are made of very fertile soil. The inhabitants of chars are not recognised by the Government of West Bengal on the grounds that it is not known whether they are Bengalis or Bangladeshi refugees. Consequently, no identification documents are issued to char-dwellers who cannot benefit from health care, barely survive due to very poor sanitation and are prevented from emigrating to the mainland to find jobs when they have turned 14. On a particular char it was reported that 13% of women died at childbirth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wanderinggaia.com|title=Wandering Gaia|publisher=&quot;The Give and Take of the Ganges&quot; WordPress.com |date= |accessdate=2009-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The common [[Bengali language]] and culture anchors the shared tradition of two parts of politically divided Bengal. Bengal has a long tradition in folk literature, evidenced by the ''[[Charyapada]]'', ''[[Mangalkavya]]'', ''[[Shreekrishna Kirtana]]'', ''[[Maimansingha Gitika]]'' or ''[[Thakurmar Jhuli]]''. Bengali literature in the medieval age was often either religious (e.g. [[Chandidas]]), or adaptations from other languages (e.g. [[Alaol]]). During the [[Bengal Renaissance]] of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, [[Bengali literature]] was modernized through the works of authors such as [[Michael Madhusudan Dutta]], [[Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay]], [[Rabindranath Tagore]], [[Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar]] and [[Kazi Nazrul Islam]].

The [[Baul]] tradition is a unique heritage of Bangla folk music.&lt;ref name=baulbengalonline&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scholar saint Sri Anirvan loved Baul music, and in fact described himself as a simple Baul.&lt;ref&gt;http://banglapedia.search.com.bd/HT/A_0246.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Other folk music forms include [[Gombhira]], [[Bhatiali]] and [[Bhawaiya]]. Folk music in Bengal is often accompanied by the [[ektara]], a one-stringed instrument. Other instruments include the [[dotara]], [[dhol]], [[flute]], and [[tabla]]. The region also has an active heritage in [[Hindustani classical music|North Indian classical music]].

Bengal had also been the harbinger of [[modernism]] in [[Indian art]]s. Abanindranath Tagore, one of the important 18th century artist from Bengal is often referred to as the father of Indian modern art. He had established the first non-British art academy in India known as the Kalabhavan within the premises of [[Santiniketan]]. Santiniketan in course of time had produced many important Indian artists like [[Gaganendranath Tagore]], [[Nandalal Bose]], [[Jamini Roy]], [[Benode Bihari Mukherjee]] and [[Ramkinkar Baij]]. In the post-independence era, Bengal had produced important artists like [[Somenath Hore]], [[Meera Mukherjee]] and [[Ganesh Pyne]].

Rice and fish are traditional favorite foods, leading to a saying that in Bengali, ''mach ar bhaath bangali baanaay'', that translates as &quot;fish and rice make a Bengali&quot;.&lt;ref name=machhe&gt;{{cite web

Bengali women commonly wear the ''[[sari|shaŗi]]'' and the [[salwar kameez]], often distinctly designed according to local cultural customs. In urban areas, many women and men wear Western-style attire. Among men, European dressing has greater acceptance. Men also wear traditional costumes such as the ''[[kurta|panjabi]]'' with ''[[dhoti|dhuti]]'' or ''[[pyjama]]'', often on religious occasions. The [[lungi]], a kind of long skirt, is widely worn by Bangladeshi men.

The greatest religious festivals are the two [[religious festival|Eid]]s ([[Eid ul-Fitr]] and [[Eid ul-Adha]]) for the Muslims, and the autumnal [[Durga|Durga Puja]] for Hindus.&lt;ref name=durgapuja&gt;{{cite web

[[Bengali cinema]] are made both in Kolkata and Dhaka. The Kolkata film industry is older and particularly well known for its [[art film]]s. Its long tradition of film making has produced world famous [[Film director|directors]] like [[Satyajit Ray]], while contemporary directors include [[Buddhadev Dasgupta]] and [[Aparna Sen]]. Dhaka also has a vibrant commercial industry and more recently has been home to critically acclaimed directors like [[Tareque Masud]]. Mainstream Hindi films of [[Bollywood]] are also quite popular in both West Bengal and Bangladesh. Around 200 dailies are published in Bangladesh, along with more than 1800 periodicals. West Bengal had 559 published newspapers in 2005,&lt;ref name=rniindia&gt;{{cite web

The official land border crossing at Petrapole-Benapole is the primary conduit for the over $1 billion trade between the two halves of Bengal. The volume of unofficial exports to Bangladesh from India is reportedly in the range of $350–500 million each year.&lt;ref name=hindubusiinformal&gt;{{cite news

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bangladesh]] argues that [[India]] needs to open up its border more to Bangladeshi exports. Other landports between the two Bengals are Changrabandha-Burimari and Balurghat-Hili.

Cultural exchanges between the two parts of Bengal have been somewhat (but not fully) impacted by ups and downs in India-Bangladesh relations and in the influence of extremist Islamist groups in Bangladesh. [[West Bengal]] singers and actors complained about being rejected visas in previous years. Bangladesh television channels are widely watched in West Bengal. West Bengal media have an audience in Bangladesh. In foreign countries such as the [[U.S.]], [[Canada]], [[United Kingdom|Britain]], and [[UAE]], it is common for Bengalis from both sides to form joint cultural associations and friendships, although inter-marriage is not significant, especially across religious barriers.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Isaac Newton]]'s rotating '''bucket argument''' (also known as &quot;Newton's bucket&quot;) was designed to demonstrate that true rotational motion cannot be defined as the relative rotation of the body with respect to the immediately surrounding bodies.  It is one of five [[argument]]s from the &quot;properties, causes, and effects&quot; of true motion and rest that support his contention that, in general, true motion and rest cannot be defined as special instances of motion or rest relative to other bodies, but instead can be defined only by reference to [[absolute space]]. Alternatively, these experiments provide an [[operational definition]] of what is meant by &quot;absolute rotation&quot;, and do not pretend to address the question of &quot;rotation relative to ''what''?&quot;.&lt;ref name=Cohen&gt;{{cite book |title=The Cambridge Companion to Newton |page=43 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=3wIzvqzfUXkC&amp;pg=PA44&amp;dq=centrifugal+Einstein+rotating+globes&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;sig=ACfU3U3jJ17ym_ZZ3cNMJl9oTjzKVyQCRQ#PPA43,M1 |isbn=0521656966 |year=2002 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |author=Robert Disalle (I.

==Background==
These arguments, and a discussion of the distinctions between absolute and relative time, space, place and motion, appear in a [[Scholium]]  at the very beginning of his great work, ''[[The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy]]'' (1687), which established the foundations of [[classical mechanics]] and introduced his [[law of universal gravitation]], which yielded the first quantitatively adequate dynamical explanation of [[planetary motion]]. See the ''Principia'' on line at [http://ia310114.us.archive.org/2/items/newtonspmathema00newtrich/newtonspmathema00newtrich.pdf Andrew Motte Translation] pp.&amp;nbsp;77–82.

Despite their embrace of the principle of rectilinear [[inertia]] and the recognition of the kinematical relativity of apparent motion (which underlies whether the [[Geocentric model|Ptolemaic]] or the [[Heliocentrism|Copernican]] system is correct), natural philosophers of the seventeenth century continued to consider true motion and rest as physically separate descriptors of an individual body.  The dominant view Newton opposed was devised by [[René Descartes]], and was supported (in part) by [[Gottfried Leibniz]].  It held that empty space is a metaphysical impossibility because space is nothing other than the extension of matter, or, in other words, that when one speaks of the space between things one is actually making reference to the relationship that exists between those things and not to some entity that stands between them.&lt;ref name=Descartes&gt;{{cite book |title=Descartes: Selected Philosophical Writings |author=René Descartes, John Cottingham translator |page=191 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=6tNxSphqAYkC&amp;pg=PA191&amp;dq=descartes+space+separation&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;sig=ACfU3U28_PwIpRieQRzFJNVOooA9k4no3A |isbn=0521358124 |year=1988 |publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Koyre&gt;{{cite book |title=From the Closed World to the Infinite Universe |author=Alexandre Koyre |page=75 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=gNVB0QnZlXgC&amp;pg=PA75&amp;dq=descartes+space+separation&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;sig=ACfU3U1CCJlcO8hB4lnLRxk1dfJDzd1dog
|isbn=1606201433 |publisher=Forgotten Books |year=1957  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Concordant with the above understanding, any assertion about the motion of a body boils down to a description over time in which the body under consideration is at t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; found in the vicinity of one group of &quot;landmark&quot; bodies and at some t&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is found in the vicinity of some other &quot;landmark&quot; body or bodies.&lt;ref name=pricipia&gt;{{cite book |title=Principia philosophiae |author=René Descartes |year=1664 |at=Part ii, §25,  p. 105 |nopp=true }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Garber&gt;{{cite book |title=Descartes' Metaphysical Physics |author=Daniel Garber |page=170 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ORGKw7CZMQAC&amp;pg=PA170&amp;dq=descartes+space+separation&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;sig=ACfU3U1m-BNNiqxKgvuHARWfVnOZUUsB0g

B: Outer ring rotates, but in opposite direction. C: Both rotate, but in opposite directions. D: Both are locked together and rotate in the same direction.]]

Descartes recognized that there would be a real difference, however, between a situation in which a body with movable parts and originally at rest with respect to a surrounding ring was itself accelerated to a certain angular velocity with respect to the ring, and another situation in which the surrounding ring was given a contrary acceleration with respect to the central object. With sole regard to the central object and the surrounding ring, the motions would be indistinguishable from each other assuming that both the central object and the surrounding ring were absolutely rigid objects. However, if neither the central object nor the surrounding ring were absolutely rigid then the parts of one or both of them would tend to fly out from the axis of rotation.

Here is an everyday experience of the basic nature of the Descartes experiment: Consider sitting in your train and noticing a train originally at rest beside you in the railway station pulling away. Initially you think it is your own train accelerating, but then notice with surprise that you feel no force. Thus, it is not your own train moving, but the neighboring train. On the other hand, you would confirm your own train is accelerating if you sensed ''g''-forces from the acceleration of your own train.

For contingent reasons having to do with the Inquisition, Descartes spoke of motion as both absolute and relative.&lt;ref name=Disalle&gt;{{cite book |title=Understanding Space-time: The philosophical development of physics from Newton to Einstein |author=Robert Disalle |page=19 |year=2006 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0521857902 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=5rxYBvx7tW0C&amp;pg=PA26&amp;vq=at+rest&amp;dq=descartes+space+separation&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;source=gbs_search_s&amp;sig=ACfU3U1so8wiXlaY2hDxbJzpCnuAi7u5lA#PPA19,M1

==The argument==
Newton discusses a [[bucket]] filled with [[water]] hung by a cord.&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion of Newton's original argument, see {{cite book |title=Einstein's Theory of Relativity|author=Max Born &amp; Günther Leibfried|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Afeff9XNwgoC&amp;pg=PA76&amp;dq=%22inertial+forces%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;sig=0kiN27BqUqHaZ9CkPdqLIjr-Nnw#PPA78,M1
|pages=78–79 |isbn=0486607690|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;   If the cord is twisted up tightly on itself and then the bucket is released, it begins to spin rapidly, not only with respect to the experimenter, but also in relation to the water it contains. (This situation would correspond to diagram B above.)

Although the relative motion at this stage is the greatest, the surface of the water remains flat, indicating that the parts of the water have no tendency to recede from the axis of relative motion, despite proximity to the pail. Eventually,  as the cord continues to unwind, the surface of the water assumes a concave shape as it acquires the motion of the bucket spinning relative to the experimenter. This concave shape shows that the water is rotating, despite the fact that the water is at rest relative to the pail. In other words, it is not the relative motion of the pail and water that causes concavity of the water, contrary to the idea that motions can only be relative, and that there is no absolute motion. (This situation would correspond to diagram D.) Possibly the concavity of the water shows rotation relative to ''something else'': say absolute space? Newton says: &quot;one can find out and measure the true and absolute circular motion of the water&quot;.&lt;ref name=Cohen_Smith&gt;{{cite book |author=Robert Disalle |chapter=Newton's philosophical analysis of space and time |editor=I.

{{Quotation|If a vessel, hung by a long cord, is so often turned about that the cord is strongly twisted, then filled with water, and held at rest together with the water; after, by the sudden action of another force, it is whirled about in the contrary way, and while the cord is untwisting itself, the vessel continues for some time this motion; the surface of the water will at first be plain, as before the vessel began to move; but the vessel by gradually communicating its motion to the water, will make it begin sensibly to revolve, and recede by little and little, and ascend to the sides of the vessel, forming itself into a concave figure...This ascent of the water shows its endeavour to recede from the axis of its motion; and the true and absolute circular motion of the water, which is here directly contrary to the relative, discovers itself, and may be measured by this endeavour. ... And therefore, this endeavour does not depend upon any translation of the water in respect to ambient bodies, nor can true circular motion be defined by such translation. ...; but relative motions...are altogether destitute of any real effect. ...It is indeed a matter of great difficulty to discover, and effectually to distinguish, the true motions of particular bodies from the apparent; because the parts of that immovable space in which these motions are performed, do by no means come under the observations of our senses.|Isaac Newton; ''Principia'', Book 1: Scholium}}

The argument that the motion is absolute, not relative, is incomplete, as it limits the participants relevant to the experiment to only the pail and the water, a limitation that has not been established. In fact, the concavity of the water clearly involves gravitational attraction, and by implication the Earth also is a participant. Here is a critique due to Mach arguing that only relative motion is established:&lt;ref name=Bouquiaux&gt;{{cite book |title=Leibniz |author=L. Bouquiaux (Marcelo Dascal, editor) |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Da_oP3sJs1oC&amp;pg=PA104&amp;dq=rotating+tension+Newton&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;sig=ACfU3U3_K0FOH8-DhzsQIrMOXizpKoY46Q#PPA104,M1 |page=104 |isbn=1402086679 |publisher=Springer |year=2008  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quotation|Newton's experiment with the rotating vessel of water simply informs us that the relative rotation of the water with respect to the sides of the vessel produces no noticeable centrifugal forces, but that such forces are produced by its relative rotations with respect to the mass of the earth and other celestial bodies.|Ernst Mach, as quoted by L. Bouquiaux in ''Leibniz'', p. 104}}

All observers agree that the surface of rotating water is curved. However, the explanation of this curvature involves centrifugal force for all observers with the exception of a truly stationary observer, who finds the curvature is consistent with the rate of rotation of the water as they observe it, with no need for an additional centrifugal force. Thus, a stationary frame can be identified, and it is not necessary to ask &quot;Stationary with respect to what?&quot;:

A supplementary [[thought experiment]] with the same objective of determining the occurrence of absolute rotation also was proposed by Newton: the example of observing two identical spheres in rotation about their center of gravity and tied together by a string. Occurrence of tension in the string is indicative of absolute rotation; see [[Rotating spheres]].

==Detailed analysis==
[[File:Coriolis effect11.jpg|thumb|right|The interface of two [[Miscibility|immiscible]] liquids rotating around a vertical axis is an upward-opening circular paraboloid.]]
Of course, the historic interest of the rotating bucket experiment is its usefulness in suggesting one can detect absolute rotation by observation of the shape of the surface of the water. However, one might question just how rotation brings about this change. Below are three approaches to understanding the concavity of the surface of rotating water in a bucket.
[[Image:ForceDiagram.PNG|thumb|200px|right|Force diagram for an element of water surface in co-rotating frame. ''Top'': Radial section and selected point on water surface; the water, the co-rotating frame, and the radial section share a constant angular rate of rotation given by the vector '''Ω'''. ''Bottom'': Force diagram at selected point on surface. The slope of the surface adjusts to make all three forces sum to zero.]]

===Newton's laws of motion===
The shape of the surface of a rotating liquid in a bucket can be determined using Newton's laws for the various forces on an element of the surface. For example, see Knudsen and Hjorth.&lt;ref name= Knudsen2&gt;{{cite book |title=Elements of Newtonian Mechanics |edition=3rd Edition |author=Jens M. Knudsen, Poul G. Hjorth |page=143 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Urumwws_lWUC&amp;pg=PA143&amp;dq=rotating+fluid+bucket+%22centrifugal+force%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0 |publisher=Springer |year=2000 |isbn=354067652X,  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The analysis begins with the free body diagram in the co-rotating frame where the water appears stationary. The height of the water ''h'' = ''h''(''r'') is a function of the radial distance ''r'' from the axis of rotation '''Ω''', and the aim is to determine this function. An element of water volume on the surface is shown to be subject to three forces: the vertical force due to gravity '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;, the horizontal, radially outward centrifugal force '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;Cfgl&lt;/sub&gt;, and the force normal to the surface of the water '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; due to the rest of the water surrounding the selected element of surface. The force due to surrounding water is known to be normal to the surface of the water because a liquid in equilibrium cannot support [[shear stress]]es.&lt;ref name=Lerner&gt;{{cite book |author= Lawrence S. Lerner |title=Physics for Scientists and Engineers |page=404 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=eJhkD0LKtJEC&amp;pg=PA404&amp;dq=shear+stress+%22pascal%27s+principle%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0 |isbn=0867204796 |publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett |year=1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To quote Anthony and Brackett:&lt;ref name=Anthony&gt;{{cite book  |title=Elementary Text-book of Physics |author=William Arnold Anthony &amp; Cyrus Fogg Brackett |page=127 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=RttHAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA125&amp;dq=%22pascal%27s+law%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0#PPA127,M1 |year=1884 |publisher=Wiley }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{quotation|The surface of a fluid of uniform density..., if at rest, is everywhere perpendicular to the lines of force; for if this were not so, the force at a point on the surface could be resolved into two components, one perpendicular and the other tangent to the surface. But from the nature of a fluid, the tangential force would set up a motion of the fluid, which is contrary to the statement that the fluid is at rest.|William Arnold Anthony &amp; Cyrus Fogg Brackett: ''Elementary Text-book of Physics'', p. 127}}  Moreover, because the element of water does not move, the sum of all three forces must be zero. To sum to zero, the force of the water must point oppositely to the sum of the centrifugal and gravity forces, which means the surface of the water must adjust so its normal points in this direction. (A very similar problem is the design of a [[Centripetal_force#Example:_The_banked_turn|banked turn]], where the slope of the turn is set so a car will not slide off the road. The analogy in the case of rotating bucket is that the element of water surface will &quot;slide&quot; up or down the surface unless the normal to the surface aligns with the vector resultant formed by the [[vector addition]] '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; + '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;Cfgl&lt;/sub&gt;.)

As ''r'' increases, the centrifugal force increases according to the relation (the equations are written per unit mass):
:&lt;math&gt;F_{\mathrm{Cfgl}} =  m \mathit{\Omega}^2 r \ , &lt;/math&gt;
where ''Ω'' is the constant rate of rotation of the water. The gravitational force is unchanged at
:&lt;math&gt;F_{\mathrm{g}} = mg \ , &lt;/math&gt;
where ''g'' is the [[Gravitational acceleration|acceleration due to gravity]]. These two forces add to make a resultant at an angle ''φ'' from the vertical given by
:&lt;math&gt;\tan \varphi =\frac{F_{\mathrm{Cfgl}}}{F_{\mathrm{g}}} = \frac { \mathit{\Omega}^2 r }{g} \ ,&lt;/math&gt;
which clearly becomes larger as ''r'' increases. To insure that this resultant is normal to the surface of the water, and therefore can be effectively nulled by the force of the water beneath, the normal to the surface must have the same angle, that is,
:&lt;math&gt;\tan \varphi = \frac{dh}{dr} \ , &lt;/math&gt;
leading to the ordinary differential equation for the shape of the surface:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dh}{dr}  =  \frac { \mathit{\Omega}^2 r }{g} \ ,&lt;/math&gt;
or, integrating:
:&lt;math&gt; h(r) =h(0) + \frac{1}{2g} \left( \mathit{\Omega} r \right)^2 \ ,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''h''(0) is the height of the water at ''r'' = 0. In words, the surface of the water is parabolic in its dependence upon the radius.

===Potential energy===
The shape of the water's surface can be found in a different, very intuitive way using the interesting idea of the [[potential energy]] associated with the centrifugal force in the co-rotating frame.
In a reference frame uniformly rotating at angular rate Ω, the fictitious centrifugal force is [[conservative force|conservative]] and has a potential energy of the form:&lt;ref name=Carmichael&gt;{{cite book |page=78 |author= Robert Daniel Carmichael |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=LKAgAAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=fictitious+Christoffel+potential&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0#PPA78,M1 |title=The Theory of Relativity |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |year=1920   }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Weber&gt;{{cite book |title=Essential mathematical methods for physicists |author=Hans J.

where ''r'' is the radius from the axis of rotation. This result can be verified by taking the gradient of the potential to obtain the radially outward force:

:&lt;math&gt; F_{\mathrm{Cfgl}} = -\frac{\partial }{\partial r} {U}_{\mathrm{Cfgl}} &lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;= m \Omega^2 r \ . &lt;/math&gt;
The meaning of the potential energy is that movement of a test body from a larger radius to a smaller radius involves doing [[Mechanical work|work]] against the centrifugal force.

The potential energy is useful, for example, in understanding the concavity of the water surface in a rotating bucket. Notice that at [[Mechanical equilibrium|equilibrium]] the surface adopts a shape such that an element of volume at any location on its surface has the same potential energy as at any other. That being so, no element of water on the surface has any incentive to move position, because all positions are equivalent in energy. That is, equilibrium is attained. On the other hand, were surface regions with lower energy available, the water occupying surface locations of higher potential energy would move to occupy these positions of lower energy, inasmuch as there is no barrier to lateral movement in an ideal liquid.

We might imagine deliberately upsetting this equilibrium situation by somehow momentarily altering the surface shape of the water to make it different from an equal-energy surface. This change in shape would not be stable, and the water would not stay in our artificially contrived shape, but engage in a transient exploration of many shapes until non-ideal frictional forces introduced by sloshing, either against the sides of the bucket or by the non-ideal nature of the liquid, killed the oscillations and the water settled down to the equilibrium shape.

To see the principle of an equal-energy surface at work, imagine gradually increasing the rate of rotation of the bucket from zero. The water surface is flat at first, and clearly a surface of equal potential energy because all points on the surface are at the same height in the gravitational field acting upon the water. At some small angular rate of rotation, however, an element of surface water can achieve lower potential energy by moving outward under the influence of the centrifugal force. Because water is incompressible and must remain within the confines of the bucket, this outward movement increases the depth of water at the larger radius, increasing the height of the surface at larger radius, and lowering it at smaller radius. The surface of the water becomes slightly concave, with the consequence that the potential energy of the water at the greater radius is increased by the work done against gravity to achieve the greater height. As the height of water increases, movement toward the periphery becomes no longer advantageous, because the reduction in potential energy from working with the centrifugal force is balanced against the increase in energy working against gravity. Thus, at a given angular rate of rotation, a concave surface represents the stable situation, and the more rapid the rotation, the more concave this surface. If rotation is arrested, the energy stored in fashioning the concave surface must be dissipated, for example through friction, before an equilibrium flat surface is restored.

To implement a surface of constant potential energy quantitatively, let the height of the water be  &lt;math&gt;h(r)\,&lt;/math&gt;: then the potential energy per unit mass contributed by gravity is &lt;math&gt;g h(r) \ &lt;/math&gt;  and the total potential energy per unit mass on the surface is
:&lt;math&gt;{U} = {U}_0 + gh(r) - \frac{1}{2}\Omega^2 r^2\,&lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;{U}_0&lt;/math&gt; the background energy level independent of ''r''. In a static situation (no motion of the fluid in the rotating frame), this energy is constant independent of position ''r''.  Requiring the energy to be constant, we obtain the [[Parabola|parabolic]] form:

:&lt;math&gt;h(r) =  \frac{\Omega^2}{2g}r^2 + h(0) \ , &lt;/math&gt;

where ''h(0)'' is the height at ''r'' = 0 (the axis). See Figures 1 and 2.

The principle of operation of the [[centrifuge]] also can be simply understood in terms of this expression for the potential energy, which shows that it is favorable energetically when the volume far from the axis of rotation is occupied by the heavier substance.

A '''breviary''' (from [[Latin]] ''brevis'', 'short' or 'concise') is a [[liturgical book]] of the [[Latin liturgical rites]] of the [[Catholic Church]] containing the public or canonical [[prayer]]s, [[hymn]]s, the [[Psalms]], readings, and notations for everyday use, especially by bishops, priests, and deacons in the Divine Office (i.e., at the [[canonical hours]] or [[Liturgy of the Hours]], the Christians' daily prayer). The word  can also refer to a collection of Christian orders of prayers and readings, such as contained in Anglican or Lutheran resources. In general, the word ''breviary'' may be used to refer to an abridged version of any text or a brief account or summary of some subject, but is primarily used to refer to the Catholic liturgical book. 

The volume containing the daily hours of Roman Catholic prayer was published as the ''Breviarium Romanum'' (Roman Breviary) until the reforms of Paul VI, when it became known as the Liturgy of the Hours. However, these terms are used interchangeably to refer to the Office in all its forms. This entry deals with the Breviary prior to the changes introduced by [[Pope Paul VI]] in 1974.

==Origin of name==
This word breviary (Lat. Breviarium), signifies in its primary acceptation an abridgment, or a compendium. It is often employed in this sense by Christian authors, e.g. Breviarium fidei, Breviarium in psalmos, Breviarium canonum, Breviarium regularum. In liturgical language Breviary has a special meaning, indicating a book furnishing the regulations for the celebration of Mass or the canonical Office, and may be met with under the titles Breviarium Ecclesiastici Ordinis, or Breviarium Ecclesiæ Rominsæ (Romanæ). In the ninth century Alcuin uses the word to designate an office abridged or simplified for the use of the laity. [[Prudentius of Troyes]], about the same period, composed a Breviarium Psalterii (v. inf. V. HISTORY). In an ancient inventory occurs Breviarium Antiphonarii, meaning &quot;Extracts from the Antiphonary&quot;. In the &quot;Vita Aldrici&quot; occurs &quot;sicut in plenariis et breviariis Ecclesiæ ejusdem continentur&quot;. Again, in the inventories in the catalogues, such notes as these may be met with: &quot;Sunt et duo cursinarii et tres benedictionales Libri; ex his unus habet obsequium mortuorum et unus Breviarius&quot;, or, &quot;Præter Breviarium quoddam quod usque ad festivitatem S. Joannis Baptistæ retinebunt&quot;, etc. Monte Cassino about A.D. 1100 obtained a book titled &quot;Incipit Breviarium sive Ordo Officiorum per totam anni decursionem&quot;.

From such references, and from others of a like nature, Quesnel gathers that by the word Breviarium was at first designated a book furnishing the rubrics, a sort of Ordo. The title Breviary, as we employ it – that is, a book containing the entire canonical office – appears to date from the eleventh century. 

[[Pope Gregory VII|St. Gregory VII]] having, indeed, abridged the order of prayers, and having simplified the Liturgy as performed at the Roman Court, this abridgment received the name of Breviary, which was suitable, since, according to the etymology of the word, it was an abridgment. The name has been extended to books which contain in one volume, or at least in one work, liturgical books of different kinds, such as the Psalter, the Antiphonary, the Responsoriary, the Lectionary, etc. In this connection it may be pointed out that in this sense the word, as it is used nowadays, is illogical; it should be named a Plenarium rather than a Breviarium, since, liturgically speaking, the word Plenarium exactly designates such books as contain several different compilations united under one cover. This is pointed out, however, simply to make still clearer the meaning and origin of the word; and section V will furnish a more detailed explanation of the formation of the Breviary.

==History==
[[File:Stuartbreviary.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Mary, Queen of Scots|Mary Stuart's]] personal breviary, which she took with her to the scaffold, is preserved in the [[National Library of Russia]] of [[St. Petersburg]]]]

===Early history===
The canonical hours of the Breviary owe their remote origin to the [[Old Covenant]] when God commanded the Aaronic priests to offer morning and evening sacrifices. Other inspiration may have come from David's words in the Psalms &quot;Seven times a day I praise you&quot; (Ps. 119:164), as well as, &quot;the just man meditates on the law day and night&quot; (Ps. 1:2). 

In the early days of Christian worship the Bible furnished all that was thought necessary, containing as it did the books from which the lessons were read and the psalms that were recited. The first step in the evolution of the Breviary was the separation of the Psalter into a choir-book. At first the president of the local church (bishop) or the leader of the choir chose a particular psalm as he thought appropriate. From about the 4th century certain psalms began to be grouped together, a process that was furthered by the monastic practice of daily reciting the 150 psalms. This took so much time that the monks began to spread it over a week, dividing each day into hours, and allotting to each hour its portion of the Psalter. St Benedict in the 6th century drew up such an arrangement, probably, though not certainly, on the basis of an older Roman division which, though not so skilful, is the one in general use. Gradually there were added to these psalter choir-books additions in the form of antiphons, responses, collects or short prayers, for the use of those not skilful at improvisation and metrical compositions. [[Jean Beleth]], a 12th-century liturgical author, gives the following list of books necessary for the right conduct of the canonical office:— the Antiphonarium, the Old and New Testaments, the ''Passionarius (liber)'' and the ''Legendarius'' (dealing respectively with martyrs and saints), the ''Homiliarius'' (homilies on the Gospels), the ''Sermologus'' (collection of sermons) and the works of the Fathers, besides, of course, the ''Psalterium'' and the ''Collectarium''. To overcome the inconvenience of using such a library the Breviary came into existence and use. Already in the 8th century [[Prudentius, bishop of Troyes]], had in a ''Breviarium Psalterii'' made an abridgment of the Psalter for the laity, giving a few psalms for each day, and Alcuin had rendered a similar service by including a prayer for each day and some other prayers, but no lessons or homilies. The Breviary rightly so called, however, only dates from the 11th century; the earliest MS. containing the whole canonical office is of the year 1099 and is in the Mazarin library. Gregory VII. (pope 1073-1085), too, simplified the liturgy as performed at the Roman court, and gave his abridgment the name of Breviary, which thus came to denote a work which from another point of view might be called a Plenary, involving as it did the collection of several works into one. There are several extant specimens of 12th-century Breviaries, all Benedictine, but under Innocent III. (pope 1198-1216) their use was extended, especially by the newly founded and active Franciscan order. These preaching friars, with the authorization of Gregory IX., adopted (with some modifications, e.g. the substitution of the &quot;Gallican&quot; for the &quot;Roman&quot; version of the Psalter) the Breviary hitherto used exclusively by the Roman court, and with it gradually swept out of Europe all the earlier partial books (Legendaries, Responsories), &amp;c., and to some extent the local Breviaries, like that of Sarum. Finally, [[Pope Nicholas III|Nicholas III]]. (pope 1277-1280) adopted this version both for the curia and for the basilicas of Rome, and thus made its position secure.

===Local and regular breviaries===
The Benedictines and Dominicans have Breviaries of their own. The only other types that merit notice are:—
# the Mozarabic Breviary, once in use throughout all Spain, but now confined to a single foundation at Toledo; it is remarkable for the number and length of its hymns, and for the fact that the majority of its collects are addressed to God the Son;
# the Ambrosian, now confined to Milan, where it owes its retention to the attachment of the clergy and people to their traditionary rites, which they derive from St Ambrose.

===Early modern reforms===
Until the council of Trent every bishop had full power to regulate the Breviary of his own diocese; and this was acted upon almost everywhere. Each monastic community, also, had one of its own. Pius V. (pope 1566-1572), however, while sanctioning those which could show at least 200 years of existence, made the Roman obligatory in all other places. But the influence of the court of Rome has gradually gone much beyond this, and has superseded almost all the local &quot;uses.&quot; The Roman has thus become nearly universal, with the allowance only of additional offices for saints specially venerated in each particular diocese. The Roman Breviary has undergone several revisions: The most remarkable of these is that by [[Francisco de Quiñones|Francis Quignonez]], cardinal of Santa Croce in Gerusalemme (1536), which, though not accepted by Rome (it was approved by Clement VII. and Paul III., and permitted as a substitute for the unrevised Breviary, until Pius V. in 1568 excluded it as too short and too modern, and issued a reformed edition (''Breviarium Pianum'', Pian Breviary) of the old Breviary), formed the model for the still more thorough reform made in 1549 by the [[Church of England]], whose daily morning and evening services are but a condensation and simplification of the Breviary offices. Some parts of the prefaces at the beginning of the English Prayer-Book are free translations of those of Quignonez. The Pian Breviary was again altered by [[Sixtus V]] in 1588, who introduced the revised [[Vulgate]], in 1602 by Clement VIII (through [[Baronius]] and Bellarmine), especially as concerns the rubrics; and by Urban VIII. (1623–1644), a purist who unfortunately tampered with the text of the hymns, injuring both their literary charm and their historic worth.

In the 17th and 18th centuries a movement of revision took place in France, and succeeded in modifying about half the Breviaries of that country. Historically, this proceeded from the labours of [[Jean de Launoy]] (1603–1678), &quot;le dénicheur des saints,&quot; and [[Louis Sébastien le Nain de Tillemont]], who had shown the falsity of numerous lives of the saints; while theologically it was produced by the Port Royal school, which led men to dwell more on communion with God as contrasted with the invocation of the saints. This was mainly carried out by the adoption of a rule that all antiphons and responses should be in the exact words of Scripture, which, of course, cut out the whole class of appeals to created beings. The services were at the same time simplified and shortened, and the use of the whole Psalter every week (which had become a mere theory in the Roman Breviary, owing to its frequent supersession by saints' day services) was made a reality. These reformed French Breviaries—e.g. the Paris Breviary of 1680 by Archbishop [[François de Harlay]] (1625–1695) and that of 1736 by Archbishop [[Charles Gaspard Guillaume de Vintimille]] (1655–1746)—show a deep knowledge of Holy Scripture, and much careful adaptation of different texts.

===Later modern reforms===
During the pontificate of [[Pius IX]]. a strong Ultramontane movement arose against the French Breviaries of 1680 and 1736. This was inaugurated by [[Montalembert]], but its literary advocates were chiefly Dom Gueranger, a learned Benedictine monk, abbot of Solesmes, and [[Louis François Veuillot]] (1813–1883) of the Univers; and it succeeded in suppressing them everywhere, the last diocese to surrender being Orleans in 1875. The Jansenist and Gallican influence was also strongly felt in Italy and in Germany, where Breviaries based on the French models were published at Cologne, Münster, Mainz and other towns. Meanwhile, under the direction of Benedict XIV. (pope 1740-1758), a special congregation collected many materials for an official revision, but nothing was published. Subsequent changes have been very few and minute. In 1902, under Leo XIII., a commission under the presidency of Monsignor [[Louis Duchesne]] was appointed to consider the Breviary, the Missal, the Pontifical and the Ritual.

The most significant changes came with the revision of the Breviary by Pius X. in 1910. Pius X. modified the traditional psalm scheme so that, while all 150 psalms were used in the course of the week, these were said without repetition. Those assigned to the Sunday Office underwent the least revision, although noticeably fewer psalms are recited at Matins, and both Lauds and Compline are slightly shorter due to psalms (or in the case of Compline the first few verses of a psalm) being removed. Pius X. was probably influenced by earlier attempts to eliminate repetition in the psalter, most notably the liturgy of the Benedictine congregation of St. Maur. However, since Cardinal Quignonez's attempt to reform the Breviary employed this principal - albeit with no regard to the traditional scheme—such notions had floated around in the western Church, and can particularly be seen in the Paris Breviary.

[[Pope John XXIII]] also revised the Breviary in 1960, introducing changes drawn up by his predecessor Pope Pius XII. The most notable alteration is the shortening of most feasts from nine to three lessons at Matins, keeping only the Scripture readings (the former lesson i, then lessons ii and iii together), followed by either the first part of the patristic reading (lesson vii) or, for most feasts, a condensed version of the former second Nocturn, which was formerly used when a feast was reduced in rank and commemorated. The new or so-called &quot;Pian&quot; psalter sponsored by Pius XII, a modern translation of the psalms from Hebrew into Latin, was also an option for use in the Office, and most breviaries published in the early 1960s used this psalter.

===Manuscripts and printed editions===
Before the rise of the [[Mendicant Orders|mendicant orders]] (wandering [[friar]]s) in the thirteenth century, the daily services were usually contained in a number of large volumes. The first occurrence of a single manuscript of the [[Canonical hours|daily office]] was written by the [[Benedictine]] order at [[Monte Cassino]] in [[Italy]] in 1099. By a strange twist, the [[Benedictine]]s were not a [[Mendicant Orders|mendicant order]], but a stable, [[monastery]]-based order, and single-volume breviaries are rare from this early period.

The arrangement of the [[Psalms]] in the [[Rule of St. Benedict]] had a profound impact upon the breviaries used by secular and monastic clergy alike, up until 1911 when Pope St. [[Pius X]] introduced his reform of the Roman Breviary. In many places, every diocese, order or ecclesiastical province maintained its own edition of the breviary. 

However, mendicant friars travelled around a lot and needed a shortened, or abbreviated, daily office contained in one portable book, and single-volume breviaries flourished from the thirteenth century onwards.

These abbreviated volumes soon became very popular and eventually supplanted the [[Roman Catholic Church]]'s [[Curia]] office, previously said by non-monastic [[clergy]]. 

Before the advent of [[printing]], breviaries were written by hand and were often richly decorated with initials and miniature illustrations telling stories in the lives of [[Christ]] or the [[saint]]s, or stories from the [[Bible]].

Later printed breviaries usually have [[woodcut]] illustrations, interesting in their own right but the poor relation of the beautifully [[illuminated manuscript|illuminated]] breviaries.

The beauty and value of many of the Latin Breviaries were brought to the notice of English churchmen by one of the numbers of the Oxford ''[[Tracts for the Times]]'', since which time they have been much more studied, both for their own sake and for the light they throw upon the English Prayer-Book.

From a bibliographical point of view some of the early printed Breviaries are among the rarest of literary curiosities, being merely local. The copies were not spread far, and were soon worn out by the daily use made of them. Doubtless many editions have perished without leaving a trace of their existence, while others are known by unique copies. In Scotland the only one which has survived the convulsions of the 16th century is ''[[Aberdeen Breviary]]'', a Scottish form of the Sarum Office (the Sarum Rite was much favoured in Scotland as a kind of protest against the jurisdiction claimed by the diocese of York), revised by [[William Elphinstone]] (bishop 1483-1514), and printed at Edinburgh by Walter Chapman and Andrew Myllar in 1509-1510. Four copies have been preserved of it, of which only one is complete; but it was reprinted in facsimile in 1854 for the Bannatyne Club by the munificence of the [[Walter Montagu Douglas Scott, 5th Duke of Buccleuch|Duke of Buccleuch]]. It is particularly valuable for the trustworthy notices of the early history of Scotland which are embedded in the lives of the national saints. Though enjoined by royal mandate in 1501 for general use within the realm of Scotland, it was probably never widely adopted. The new Scottish ''Proprium'' sanctioned for the Roman Catholic province of St Andrews in 1903 contains many of the old Aberdeen collects and antiphons.

The [[Sarum use|Sarum]] or Salisbury Breviary itself was very widely used. The first edition was printed at Venice in 1483 by Raynald de Novimagio in folio; the latest at Paris, 1556, 1557. While modern Breviaries are nearly always printed in four volumes, one for each season of the year, the editions of the Sarum never exceeded two parts.

== Contents of the Roman Breviary==
At the beginning stands the usual introductory matter, such as the tables for determining the date of Easter, the calendar, and the general rubrics. The Breviary itself is divided into four seasonal parts—winter, spring, summer, autumn—and comprises under each part:
# the Psalter;
# ''Proprium de Tempore'' (the special office of the season);
# ''Proprium Sanctorum'' (special offices of saints);
# ''Commune Sanctorum'' (general offices for saints);
# Extra Services.

These parts are often published separately.

=== The Psalter ===
{{main|Latin Psalters}}
This psalm book is the very backbone of the Breviary, the groundwork of the Catholic prayer-book; out of it have grown the antiphons, responsories and versicles. Until the 1911 reform, the psalms were arranged according to a disposition dating from the 8th century, as follows. Psalms i.-cviii., with some omissions, were recited at Matins, twelve each day from Monday to Saturday, and eighteen on Sunday. The omissions were said at Lauds, Prime and Compline. Psalms cix.-cxlvii. (except cxvii., cxviii. and cxlii.) were said at Vespers, five each day. Psalms cxlviii.-cl. were always used at Lauds, and give that hour its name. The text of this Psalter is that commonly known as the Gallican. The name is misleading, for it is simply the second revision (A.D. 392) made by Jerome of the old ''Itala'' version originally used in Rome. Jerome's first revision of the ''Itala'' (A.D. 383), known as the Roman, is still used at St Peter's in Rome, but the &quot;Gallican,&quot; thanks especially to St Gregory of Tours, who introduced it into Gaul in the 6th century, has ousted it everywhere else. The Antiphonary of Bangor proves that Ireland accepted the Gallican version in the 7th century, and the English Church did so in the 10th.

Following the 1911 reform, Matins was reduced to nine Psalms every day, with the other psalms redistributed throughout Prime, Terce, Sext, and Compline, which previously used the same psalms every day. Lauds and Vespers largely remained the same, and Psalm 118 at the Little Hours and Psalms 4, 90, and 130 at Compline were retained for Sundays and special feasts.

=== The ''Proprium de Tempore'' ===
This contains the office of the seasons of the Christian year (Advent to Trinity), a conception that only gradually grew up. There is here given the whole service for every Sunday and week-day, the proper antiphons, responsories, hymns, and especially the course of daily Scripture-reading, averaging about twenty verses a day, and (roughly) arranged thus: for Advent, Isaiah; Epiphany to Septuagesima, Pauline Epistles; Lent, patristic homilies (Genesis on Sundays); Passion-tide, Jeremiah; Easter to Whitsun, Acts, Catholic epistles and Apocalypse; Whitsun to August, Samuel and Kings; August to Advent, Wisdom books, Maccabees, Prophets.

=== The ''Proprium Sanctorum'' ===
This contains the lessons, psalms and liturgical formularies for saints' festivals, and depends on the days of the secular month. The readings of the second Nocturn are mainly hagiological biography, with homilies or papal documents for certain major feasts, particularly those of Jesus and Mary. Some of this material has been revised by Leo XIII, in view of archaeological and other discoveries. The third Nocturn consists of a homily on the Gospel which is read at that day's Mass. Covering a great stretch of time and space, they do for the worshipper in the field of church history what the Scripture readings do in that of biblical history.

=== The ''Commune Sanctorum'' ===
This comprises psalms, antiphons, lessons, &amp;c., for feasts of various groups or classes (twelve in all); e.g. apostles, martyrs, confessors, virgins, and the Blessed Virgin Mary. These offices are of very ancient date, and many of them were probably in origin proper to individual saints. They contain passages of great literary beauty. The lessons read at the third nocturn are patristic homilies on the Gospels, and together form a rough summary of theological instruction.

=== Extra services ===
Here are found the Little Office of the Blessed Virgin Mary, the Office of the Dead (obligatory on All Souls' Day), and offices peculiar to each diocese.

== Elements of the Hours ==
It has already been indicated, by reference to Matins, Lauds, &amp;c., that not only each day, but each part of the day, has its own office, the day being divided into liturgical &quot;hours.&quot; A detailed account of these will be found in the article [[Canonical Hours]]. Each of the hours of the office is composed of the same elements, and something must be said now of the nature of these constituent parts, of which mention has here and there been already made. They are: psalms (including canticles), antiphons, responsories, hymns, lessons, little chapters, versicles and collects.

=== Psalms ===
Before the 1911 reform, the multiplication of saints' festivals, with practically the same festal psalms, tended to repeat the about one-third of the Psalter, with a correspondingly rare recital of the remaining two-thirds. Following this reform, the entire Psalter is again generally recited each week, with the festal psalms restricted to only the highest-ranking feasts. As in the Greek usage and in the Benedictine, certain canticles like the Song of Moses (Exodus xv.), the [[Song of Hannah]] (1 Sam. ii.), the prayer of Habakkuk (iii.), the prayer of Hezekiah (Isaiah xxxviii.) and other similar Old Testament passages, and, from the New Testament, the [[Magnificat]], the [[Benedictus]] and the [[Nunc dimittis]], are admitted as psalms.

=== Antiphons ===
The antiphons are short liturgical forms, sometimes of biblical, sometimes of patristic origin, used to introduce a psalm. The term originally signified a chant by alternate choirs, but has quite lost this meaning in the Breviary.

=== Responsories ===
The responsories are similar in form to the antiphons, but come at the end of the psalm, being originally the reply of the choir or congregation to the precentor who recited the psalm.

=== Hymns ===
The hymns are short poems going back in part to the days of [[Prudentius]], [[Synesius]], [[Gregory of Nazianzus]] and [[Ambrose of Milan|Ambrose]] (4th and 5th centuries), but mainly the work of medieval authors.

=== Lessons ===
The lessons, as has been seen, are drawn variously from the Bible, the [[Acts of the Saints]] and the [[Fathers of the Church]]. In the primitive church, books afterwards excluded from the canon were often read, e.g. the letters of [[Clement of Rome]] and the [[Shepherd of Hermas]]. In later days the churches of Africa, having rich memorials of martyrdom, used them to supplement the reading of Scripture. Monastic influence accounts for the practice of adding to the reading of a biblical passage some patristic commentary or exposition. Books of homilies were compiled from the writings of SS. [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], [[Hilary of Poitiers|Hilary]], [[Athanasius]], [[Isidore of Seville|Isidore]], [[Pope Gregory I|Gregory the Great]] and others, and formed part of the library of which the Breviary was the ultimate compendium. In the lessons, as in the psalms, the order for special days breaks in upon the normal order of ferial offices and dislocates the scheme for consecutive reading. The lessons are read at Matins (which is subdivided into three nocturns).

=== Little chapters ===
The little chapters are very short lessons read at the other &quot;hours.&quot;

=== Versicles ===
The versicles are short responsories used after the little chapters in the minor hours. They appear after the hymns in Lauds and Vespers.

=== Collects ===
The collects come at the close of the office and are short prayers summing up the supplications of the congregation. They arise out of a primitive practice on the part of the bishop (local president), examples of which are found in the [[Didache|Didachē]] (Teaching of the Apostles) and in the letters of Clement of Rome and Cyprian. With the crystallization of church order improvisation in prayer largely gave place to set forms, and collections of prayers were made which later developed into [[Sacramentary|Sacramentaries]] and [[Orational]]s. The collects of the Breviary are largely drawn from the Gelasian and other Sacramentaries, and they are used to sum up the dominant idea of the festival in connection with which they happen to be used.

==Celebration==
Before 1910 the difficulty of harmonizing the ''Proprium de Tempore'' and the ''Proprium Sanctorum'', to which reference has been made, was only partly met in the thirty-seven chapters of general rubrics. Additional help was given by a kind of Catholic Churchman's Almanack, called the ''Ordo Recitandi Divini Officii'', published in different countries and dioceses, and giving, under every day, minute directions for proper reading. In 1960 John XXIII simplified the rubrics governing the Breviary in order to make it easier to use.

Every cleric in Holy Orders and every member of a religious order must publicly join in or privately read aloud (i.e. using the lips as well as the eyes—it takes about two hours in this way) the whole of the Breviary services allotted for each day. In large churches where they were celebrated the services were usually grouped; e.g. Matins and Lauds (about 7.30 A.M.); Prime, Terce (High Mass), Sext, and None (about 10 A.M.); Vespers and Compline (4 P.M.); and from four to eight hours (depending on the amount of music and the number of high masses) are thus spent in choir. Lay use of the Breviary has varied throughout the Church's history. In some periods laymen did not use the Breviary as a manual of devotion to any great extent. The late Medieval period saw the recitation of certain hours of the Little Office of the Blessed Virgin, which was based on the Breviary in form and content, becoming popular among those who could read, and Bishop Challoner did much to popularise the hours of Sunday Vespers and Compline (albeit in English translation) in his 'Garden of the Soul' in the eighteenth century. The Liturgical Movement in the twentieth century saw renewed interest in the Offices of the Breviary and several popular editions were produced containing the vernacular as well as the Latin.

The complete pre-Pius X. Roman Breviary was translated into English (by the marquess of Bute in 1879; new ed. with a trans, of the Martyrology, 1908), French and German. Bute's version is noteworthy for its inclusion of the skilful renderings of the ancient hymns by J.H. Newman, J.M. Neale and others. Several editions of the Pius X. Breviary were produced during the twentieth century, including a notable edition prepared with the assistance of the Sisters of Stanbrook Abbey in the 1950s. Two editions in English and Latin were produced in the mid-sixties, which conformed to the rubrics of 1960, published by Liturgical Press and Benziger in America. These used the Pius XII. psalter. [[Baronius Press]]'s revised edition of the Liturgical Press, which was originally scheduled for publication at the end of 2006), is scheduled to be printed in 2010. It will use the older Gallican psalter of St. Jerome. The company has announced that electronic typesetting for the project is nearing completion, and specimen pages have appeared on their website.

Under Pope [[Benedict XVI]]'s [[motu proprio]] [[Summorum Pontificum]], Roman Catholic bishops, priests, and deacons are again permitted to use the 1962 edition of the Roman Breviary, promulgated by [[Pope John XXIII]] to satisfy their obligation to recite the [[Liturgy of the Hours|Divine Office]] every day.

In 2008, an ''i-breviary'' was launched, which combines the ancient breviaries with the latest computer technology.

His analysis of human behavior culminated in his work ''[[Verbal Behavior]]'', which has recently seen enormous increase{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} in interest experimentally and in applied settings.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Verbal Behavior]] for research citations.&lt;/ref&gt;

Skinner discovered and advanced the ''rate of response'' as a dependent variable in psychological research. He invented the ''cumulative recorder'' to measure rate of responding as part of his highly influential work on schedules of [[reinforcement]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BO&quot;&gt;B. F.

== Biography ==
[[Image:BF Skinner Grave.JPG|thumb|right|The Skinners' grave at Mount Auburn Cemetery]]
Skinner was born in [[Susquehanna, Pennsylvania]] to Grace and William Skinner.
His father was a lawyer. He became an atheist after a liberal Christian teacher tried to assuage his fear of the Hell that his grandmother described.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Within a year I had gone to Miss Graves to tell her that I no longer believed in God. 'I know,' she said, 'I have been through that myself.' But her strategy misfired: I never went through it.&quot; B.F. Skinner, pp. 387-413, E.G. Boring and G. Lindzey's A History of Psychology in Autobiography (Vol. 5), New York: Appleton Century-Crofts, 1967.).&lt;/ref&gt; His brother Edward, two and a half years his junior, died at age sixteen of a cerebral hemorrhage. He attended [[Hamilton College]] in New York with the intention of becoming a writer. While attending, he joined Lambda Chi Alpha Fraternity.  He wrote for the school paper, but as an atheist, he was critical of the religious school he attended. He also attended Harvard University after receiving his [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in English literature in 1926. After graduation, he spent a year at his parents' home in Scranton attempting to become a writer of fiction. He soon became disillusioned with his literary skills and concluded that he had little world experience and no strong personal perspective from which to write.

Skinner received a PhD from Harvard in 1931, and remained there as a researcher until 1936. He then taught at the [[University of Minnesota]] at Minneapolis and later at [[Indiana University (Bloomington)|Indiana University]], where he was chair of the psychology department from 1946&amp;ndash;1947, before returning to Harvard as a tenured professor in 1948. He remained at Harvard for the rest of his career.

In 1936, Skinner married Yvonne Blue. The couple had two daughters, [[Julie Vargas|Julie]] (m. Vargas) and Deborah (m. Buzan). He died of [[leukemia]] on August 18, 1990, and is buried in [[Mount Auburn Cemetery]], [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;Bjork, D.W. (1993). B.F. Skinner, A Life.

== Theory ==
Radical behaviorism seeks to understand behavior as a function of environmental histories of reinforcing consequences.

Reinforcement processes were emphasized by Skinner, and were seen as primary in the shaping of behavior. A common misconception is that negative reinforcement is synonymous with punishment.  This misconception is rather pervasive, and is commonly found in even scholarly accounts of Skinner and his contributions.  To be clear, while positive reinforcement is the strengthening of behavior by the application of some event (e.g., praise after some behavior is performed), negative reinforcement is the strengthening of behavior by the removal or avoidance of some aversive event (e.g., opening and raising an umbrella over your head on a rainy day is reinforced by the cessation of rain falling on you).

Both types of reinforcement strengthen behavior, or increase the probability of a behavior reoccurring; the difference is in whether the reinforcing event is something applied (positive reinforcement) or something removed or avoided (negative reinforcement). Punishment and extinction have the effect of weakening behavior, or  decreasing the future probability of a behavior's occurrence, by the application of an aversive stimulus/event (positive punishment or punishment by contingent stimulation), removal of a desirable stimulus (negative punishment or punishment by contingent withdrawal), or the absence of a rewarding stimulus, which causes the behavior to stop (extinction).

Skinner also sought to understand the application of his theory in the broadest behavioural context as it applies to living organisms, namely natural selection.&lt;ref name=Skinner1981&gt;{{Cite journal |date=31 July 1981 |author=Skinner, B.F |title=Selection by Consequences |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=213 |issue=4507 |pages=501–504 |doi=10.1126/science.7244649 |url=http://www.psychology.uiowa.edu/Classes/31174/Documents/Selection%20by%20Consequences.pdf |accessdate=14 August 2010 |postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

== Inventions ==
=== Air crib ===
In an effort to help his wife cope with the day-to-day tasks of child rearing, Skinner &amp;ndash; a consummate inventor &amp;ndash; thought he might be able to improve upon the standard crib. He invented the 'air-crib' to meet this challenge. An 'air-crib'&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.uakron.edu/ahap/apparatus/apparatus.phtml?%20code_id=6&amp;app_id=306 A photograph of one is in an archive here]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coedu.usf.edu/cybertutorial/images/babyinbox.jpg Picture taken from the LHJ article&lt;!-- I believe--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; (also known as a 'baby tender' or humorously as an 'heir conditioner') is an easily cleaned, temperature and humidity-controlled box Skinner designed to assist in the raising of babies.

It was one of his most controversial inventions, and was popularly mischaracterized as cruel and experimental.&lt;ref name=&quot;snopes&quot;&gt;Snopes.com [http://www.snopes.com/science/skinner.asp &quot;One Man and a Baby Box&quot;], accessed on 12-29-07.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was designed to make the early childcare simpler (by greatly reducing laundry, diaper rash, cradle cap, etc.), while encouraging the baby to be more confident, mobile, comfortable, healthy and therefore less prone to cry. (Babies sleep and will sometimes play in aircribs but it's misleading to say they are 'raised' in them. Apart from newborns, most of a baby's waking hours will be spent out of the box.) Reportedly it had some success in these goals.&lt;ref name=&quot;snopes&quot;/&gt;  Air-cribs were later commercially manufactured by several companies. Air-cribs of some fashion are still used to this day, and publications continue to dispel myths about, and tout the progressive advantages of Skinner's invention.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}

A 2004 book by Lauren Slater&lt;ref name=&quot;OB&quot;&gt;Slater, L. (2004) Opening Skinner's Box: Great Psychological Experiments of the Twentieth Century, London, Bloomsbury&lt;/ref&gt; inadvertedly caused much controversy by mentioning (and then immediately denying the truth of) the common rumours that Skinner had used his baby daughter Deborah in some of his experiments and that she had subsequently committed suicide. At least one book reviewer misread the book and thought it instead asserted the truth of the rumours. Deborah Skinner (now Deborah Buzan) then in turn wrote a vehement riposte to such a mistaken review in ''[[The Guardian]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.guardian.co.uk/departments/healthmindandbody/story/0,6000,1168052,00.html &quot;I was not a lab rat&quot;] (Guardian)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cumulative recorder ===
The cumulative recorder is an instrument used to automatically record behavior graphically. Initially, its graphing mechanism has consisted of a rotating drum of paper equipped with a marking needle. The needle would start at the bottom of the page and the drum would turn the roll of paper horizontally. Each response would result in the marking needle moving vertically along the paper one tick. This makes it possible for the rate of response to be calculated by finding the slope of the graph at a given point. For example, a regular rate of response would cause the needle to move vertically at a regular rate, resulting in a straight diagonal line rising towards the right. An accelerating or decelerating rate of response would lead to a curve. The cumulative recorder provided a powerful analytical tool for studying [[reinforcement#Schedules_of_reinforcement|schedules of reinforcement]].

=== Operant conditioning chamber ===
{{Main|Operant conditioning chamber}}
While at the University of Minnesota, B. F. Skinner invented the [[operant conditioning]] chamber to measure responses of organisms (most often, rats and pigeons) and their orderly interactions with the environment. This device was an example of his lifelong ability to invent useful devices, which included whimsical devices in his childhood&lt;ref name=&quot;PML&quot;&gt;B. F. Skinner, (1984) ''Particulars of My Life''. Devices included a potato shooting machine and a perpetual motion machine, as well as a device to separate ripe from unripe berries.&lt;/ref&gt; to the ''cumulative recorder'' to measure the [[rate of response]] of organisms in an operant chamber. Even in old age, Skinner invented a ''Thinking Aid'' to assist in writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1901/jaba.1987.20-379 | last1 = Skinner | first1 = B.

=== Teaching machine ===
[[Image:Skinner teaching machine 01.jpg|thumb|right|The teaching machine, a mechanical invention to automate the task of [[programmed instruction]]]]

The teaching machine was a mechanical device whose purpose was to administer a curriculum of [[programmed instruction]].  It housed a list of questions, and a mechanism through which the learner could respond to each question.  Upon delivering a correct answer, the learner would be rewarded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coe.uh.edu/courses/cuin6373/idhistory/skinner.html|title=Programmed Instruction and Task Analysis|publisher=College of Education, University of Houston}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pigeon-guided missile ===
{{Main|Project Pigeon}}
The [[US Navy]] required a weapon effective against the German [[German battleship Bismarck|''Bismarck'' class]] battleships. Although missile and TV technology existed, the size of the primitive guidance systems available rendered any weapon ineffective. [[Project Pigeon]]&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B. F. (1960). Pigeons in a pelican. American Psychologist, 15, 28-37. Reprinted in: Skinner, B. F. (1972). Cumulative record (3rd ed.). New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts,pp. 574-591.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Described throughout ''Skinner, B. F. (1979). The shaping of a behaviorist: Part two of an autobiography. New York: Knopf.''&lt;/ref&gt; was potentially an extremely simple and effective solution, but despite an effective demonstration it was abandoned when more conventional solutions became available. The project centered on dividing the nose cone of a missile into three compartments, and encasing a pigeon in each. Each compartment used a lens to project an image of what was in front of the missile onto a screen. The pigeons would peck toward the object, thereby directing the missile.&lt;ref name=&quot;NMAH&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://historywired.si.edu/object.cfm?ID=353|title=Nose Cone, Pigeon-Guided Missile|publisher=National Museum of American History, Smithsonian Institution|accessdate=2008-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Skinner complained &quot;our problem was no one would take us seriously.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Skinner's Utopia: Panacea, or Path to Hell?|publisher=[[TIME Magazine]]|date=September 20, 1971|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,909994-5,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The point is perhaps best explained in terms of human psychology (i.e., few people would trust a pigeon to guide a missile no matter how reliable it proved).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=[[Richard Dawkins]]|title=Design for a Faith-Based Missile|journal=Free Inquiry magazine|volume= 22|issue= 1|url=http://www.secularhumanism.org/library/fi/dawkins_22_1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Radical behaviorism ==
{{Main|Radical behaviorism}}
Skinner called his particular brand of behaviorism &quot;Radical&quot; behaviorism.&lt;ref&gt;''About Behaviorism'' Ch. 1 ''Causes of Behaviour'' &amp;sect; 3 ''Radical Behaviorism'' B. F. Skinner 1974 ISBN 0-394-71618-3&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike less austere behaviorisms, it does not accept private events such as thinking, perceptions, and unobservable emotions in a causal account of an organism's behavior:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
 The position can be stated as follows: what is felt or introspectively observed is not some nonphysical world of [[consciousness]], mind, or mental life but the observer's own body. This does not mean, as I shall show later, that introspection is a kind of psychological research, nor does it mean (and this is the heart of the argument) that what are felt or introspectively observed are the causes of the behavior. An organism behaves as it does because of its current structure, but most of this is out of reach of introspection. At the moment we must content ourselves, as the methodological behaviorist insists, with a persons genetic and environment histories. What are introspectively observed are certain collateral products of those histories.
&lt;br/&gt;...&lt;br/&gt;
In this way we repair the major damage wrought by [[mentalism (disambiguation)|mentalism]]. When what a person does [is] attributed to what is going on inside him, investigation is brought to an end. Why explain the explanation? For twenty five hundred years people have been preoccupied with feelings and mental life, but only recently has any interest been shown in a more precise analysis of the role of the environment. Ignorance of that role lead in the first place to mental fictions, and it has been perpetuated by the explanatory practices to which they gave rise.&lt;ref&gt;''ibid''. pp. 18-20 of the paperback edition which had the redacted typo s/it/is/.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
It can be seen by the above that this methodological stance is a reaction and predates the current level of advancement, in which mental structures can be observed in operation via technologies such as [[functional MRI]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

== ''Verbal Behavior'' ==
{{Main|Verbal Behavior (book)}}
Challenged by [[Alfred North Whitehead]] during a casual discussion while at Harvard to provide an account of a randomly provided piece of verbal behavior&lt;ref&gt;B. F. Skinner, (1957) ''Verbal Behavior''. The account in the appendix is that he asked Skinner to explain why he said &quot;No black scorpion is falling upon this table.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Skinner set about attempting to extend his then-new functional, inductive, approach to the complexity of human verbal behavior. Developed over two decades, his work appeared as the culmination of the William James lectures in the book, ''[[Verbal Behavior]]''. Although Noam Chomsky was highly critical of ''[[Verbal Behavior]]'', he conceded that &quot;S-R psychology&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;RVB&quot;&gt;A. N. Chomsky, (1957) &quot;A Review of BF Skinner's Verbal Behavior.&quot; [http://www.chomsky.info/articles/1967----.htm in the preface, 2nd paragraph]&lt;/ref&gt; was a reason for giving it &quot;a review.&quot; ''[[Verbal Behavior]]'' had an uncharacteristically slow reception, partly as a result of Chomsky's review, paired with Skinner's neglect to address or rebut any of Chomsky's condemnations.&lt;ref&gt;Richelle, M. (1993). B. F. Skinner: A reappraisal. Hillsdale: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates&lt;/ref&gt;  Skinner's peers may have been slow to adopt and consider the conventions within ''[[Verbal Behavior]]'' due to its lack of experimental evidence—unlike the empirical density that marked Skinner's previous work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1901/jeab.1984.42-363 | last1 = Michael | first1 = J. | author-separator =, | author-name-separator= | year = 1984 | title = Verbal Behavior | url = | journal = Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior | volume = 42 | issue = 3| pages = 363–376 | pmid = 16812395 | pmc = 1348108 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Skinner's functional analysis of verbal behavior has seen a resurgence of interest in [[Verbal Behavior (book)|applied settings]].&lt;ref&gt;The Analysis of Verbal Behavior (Journal)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influence on education ==
{{multiple issues|section=y|cleanup=December 2007|refimprove=December 2007}}
&lt;!--Good idea to have this section, but it needs to be written in an encyclopedic style, with references--&gt;
&lt;!--A possible source might be The Technology of Teaching, as well as Keller's PSM and so on and so on--&gt;
Skinner influenced [[education]] as well as psychology. He was quoted as saying &quot;[[Teacher]]s must learn how to teach&amp;nbsp;... they need only to be taught more effective ways of teaching.&quot; Skinner asserted that positive reinforcement is more effective at changing and establishing behavior than punishment, with obvious implications for the then widespread practice of [[rote learning]] and [[school discipline|punitive discipline]] in education. Skinner also suggests that the main thing people learn from being punished is how to avoid punishment.

In The Technology of Teaching, Skinner has a chapter on why teachers fail (pages 93–113): Essentially he says that teachers have not been given an understanding of [[teaching]] and [[learning]].  Without the science underpinning teaching, teachers fall back on procedures that work poorly or not at all, such as.. 
# using aversive techniques.  They produce escape and avoidance and undesirable emotional effects.
# relying on telling and explaining. &quot;Unfortunately, a student does not learn simply when he is shown or told.&quot; p.&amp;nbsp;103
# failing to adapt learning tasks to the student's current level.
# failing to provide positive reinforcement frequently enough.

Skinner suggests that any age-appropriate skill can be taught.  The steps are
#Clearly specify the action or performance the student is to learn to do
#Break down the task into small achievable steps, going from simple to complex.
#Let the student perform each step, reinforcing correct actions
#Adjust so that the student is always successful until finally the goal is reached
#Transfer to intermittent reinforcement to maintain the student's performance
Skinner's views on education are extensively presented in his book ''The Technology of Teaching''. It is also reflected in [[Fred S. Keller]]'s ''Personalized System of Instruction'' and [[Ogden Lindsley|Ogden R. Lindsley's]] [[Precision teaching|''Precision Teaching'']].
The limitations of Skinner's views can be seen from his argument that it is: 'a step forward' to 'abolish' the 'autonomous inner man'.([[Beyond Freedom and Dignity]] (1971) p.215)

== ''Walden Two'' and ''Beyond Freedom and Dignity'' ==
Skinner is popularly known mainly for his books ''[[Walden Two]]'' and ''[[Beyond Freedom and Dignity]]''.  The former describes a visit to a fictional ''[[experimental]] [[community]]''&lt;ref&gt;B. F. Skinner, (1968). &quot;The Design of Experimental Communities&quot;, ''International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences'' (Volume 16). New York: Macmillan, 1968, pages 271-275.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1940s United States, where the productivity and happiness of the citizens is far in advance of that in the outside world because of their practice of scientific social planning and use of operant conditioning in the raising of children.

''Walden Two'', like [[Henry David Thoreau|Thoreau's]] ''[[Walden]]'', champions a lifestyle that does not support war or foster competition and social strife. It encourages a lifestyle of minimal consumption, rich social relationships, personal happiness, satisfying work and leisure.&lt;ref&gt;Ramsey, Richard David, ''Morning Star: The Values-Communication of Skinner's '''Walden Two''''', Ph.D. dissertation, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY, December 1979, available from University Microfilms, Ann Arbor, MI.  Attempts to analyze ''Walden Two'', ''Beyond Freedom and Dignity'', and other Skinner works in the context of Skinner's life; lists over 500 sources.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Beyond Freedom and Dignity'', Skinner suggests that a technology of behavior could help to make a better society. We would, however, have to accept that an [[autonomous agent]] is not the driving force of our actions. Skinner offers alternatives to punishment and challenges his readers to use science and modern technology to construct a better society.

== Schedules of reinforcement ==
{{Main|Reinforcement}}
Part of Skinner's analysis of behavior involved not only the power of a single instance of reinforcement, but the effects of particular schedules of reinforcement over time.

The most notable [[Reinforcement#Schedules of reinforcement|schedules of reinforcement]] presented by Skinner were interval (fixed or variable) and ratio (fixed or variable).
* '''Continuous reinforcement''' — constant delivery of reinforcement for an action; every time a specific action was performed the subject instantly and always received a reinforcement. This method is impractical to use, and the reinforced behavior is prone to extinction.
* '''Interval (fixed/variable) reinforcement''' Fixed — reinforcement followed the first response after a set duration. Variable — time which must elapse before a response produces reinforcement is not set, but varies around an average value.
* '''Ratio (fixed or variable) reinforcement''' Fixed — a set number of responses must occur before there is reinforcement. Variable - number of responses before reinforcement is delivered differs from the last, but has an average value.

== Political views ==
Skinner's political writings emphasized his hopes that an effective and humane science of behavioral control &amp;ndash; a technology of human behavior &amp;ndash; could help problems unsolved by earlier approaches or aggravated by advances in technology such as the [[atomic bomb]]. One of Skinner's stated goals was to prevent humanity from destroying itself.&lt;ref&gt;see Beyond Freedom and Dignity, 1974 for example&lt;/ref&gt;  He comprehended political control as aversive or non-aversive, with the purpose to control a population. Skinner supported the use of [[positive reinforcement]] as a means of coercion, citing Jean-Jacques Rousseau's novel ''[[Emile: or, On Education]]'' as an example of freedom literature that &quot;did not fear the power of positive reinforcement&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;W2&quot;/&gt;
Skinner's book, ''Walden Two'', presents a vision of a decentralized, localized society, which applies a practical, scientific approach and futuristically advanced behavioral expertise to peacefully deal with social problems. Skinner's [[utopia]], like every other utopia or [[dystopia]], is both a thought experiment and a [[rhetoric]]al piece. In his book, Skinner answers the problem that exists in many utopian novels &amp;ndash; &quot;What is the Good Life?&quot;  In ''Walden Two'', the answer is a life of friendship, health, art, a healthy balance between work and leisure, a minimum of unpleasantness, and a feeling that one has made worthwhile contributions to one's society. This was to be achieved through behavioral technology, which could offer alternatives to coercion,&lt;ref name=&quot;W2&quot;/&gt; as good science applied correctly would help society,&lt;ref name=&quot;BFD&quot;/&gt; and allow all people to cooperate with each other peacefully.&lt;ref name=&quot;W2&quot;/&gt; Skinner described his novel as &quot;my New Atlantis&quot;, in reference to [[Francis Bacon (philosopher)|Bacon]]'s [[The New Atlantis|utopia]].&lt;ref&gt;A matter of Consequences, p.&amp;nbsp;412.&lt;/ref&gt; He opposed corporal punishment in the school, and wrote a letter to the California Senate that helped lead it to a ban on spanking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Nanette |last=Asimov |title=Spanking Debate Hits Assembly |work=SFGate|publisher=San Francisco Chronicle |date=1996-01-30 |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/1996/01/30/MN71634.DTL&amp;hw=spanking+debate&amp;sn=009&amp;sc=334 |accessdate=2008-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Buckley Jr, ''On the Firing Line'', p.&amp;nbsp;87.}}

== Superstition in the pigeon ==
One of Skinner's experiments examined the formation of [[superstition]] in one of his favorite experimental animals, the [[pigeon]]. Skinner placed a series of hungry pigeons in a cage attached to an automatic mechanism that delivered food to the pigeon &quot;at regular intervals with no reference whatsoever to the bird's behavior.&quot;  He discovered that the pigeons associated the delivery of the food with whatever chance actions they had been performing as it was delivered, and that they subsequently continued to perform these same actions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oyc.yale.edu/economics/financial-markets/content/sessions/session-8-human-foibles-fraud-manipulation-and ECON 252, Lecture 8] by Professor Robert Schiller at Yale University&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|One bird was conditioned to turn counter-clockwise about the cage, making two or three turns between reinforcements. Another repeatedly thrust its head into one of the upper corners of the cage. A third developed a 'tossing' response, as if placing its head beneath an invisible bar and lifting it repeatedly. Two birds developed a pendulum motion of the head and body, in which the head was extended forward and swung from right to left with a sharp movement followed by a somewhat slower return.&lt;ref name=superstition&gt;Skinner, B. F. &quot;'Superstition' in the Pigeon,&quot; ''Journal of Experimental Psychology'' #38, 1947.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Skinner/Pigeon/ Classics in the History of Psychology — Skinner (1948)]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Skinner suggested that the pigeons behaved as if they were influencing the automatic mechanism with their &quot;rituals&quot; and that this experiment shed light on human behavior:

{{quote|The experiment might be said to demonstrate a sort of superstition. The bird behaves as if there were a causal relation between its behavior and the presentation of food, although such a relation is lacking. There are many analogies in human behavior. Rituals for changing one's fortune at cards are good examples. A few accidental connections between a ritual and favorable consequences suffice to set up and maintain the behavior in spite of many unreinforced instances. The bowler who has released a ball down the alley but continues to behave as if she were controlling it by twisting and turning her arm and shoulder is another case in point. These behaviors have, of course, no real effect upon one's luck or upon a ball half way down an alley, just as in the present case the food would appear as often if the pigeon did nothing—or, more strictly speaking, did something else.&lt;ref name=superstition /&gt;}}

Modern behavioral psychologists have disputed Skinner's &quot;superstition&quot; explanation for the behaviors he recorded. Subsequent research (e.g. Staddon and Simmelhag, 1971), while finding similar behavior, failed to find support for Skinner's &quot;adventitious reinforcement&quot; explanation for it. By looking at the timing of different behaviors within the interval, Staddon and Simmelhag were able to distinguish two classes of behavior: the ''terminal response'', which occurred in anticipation of food, and ''interim responses'', that occurred earlier in the interfood interval and were rarely contiguous with food.  Terminal responses seem to reflect classical (rather than operant) conditioning, rather than adventitious reinforcement, guided by a process like that observed in 1968 by Brown and Jenkins in their &quot;autoshaping&quot; procedures.  The causation of interim activities (such as the schedule-induced [[polydipsia]] seen in a similar situation with rats) also cannot be traced to adventitious reinforcement and its details are still obscure (Staddon, 1977).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pmcentrez&amp;artid=1348192 Timberlake &amp; Lucas, (1985) &quot;JEAB&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Negative criticism ==
=== J.E.R. Staddon ===
As understood by Skinner, ascribing ''dignity'' to individuals involves giving them credit for their actions. To say &quot;Skinner is brilliant&quot; means that Skinner is an originating force. If Skinner's [[determinism|determinist]] theory is right, he is merely the focus of his environment. He is not an originating force and he had no choice in saying the things he said or doing the things he did. Skinner's environment and genetics both allowed and compelled him to write his book. Similarly, the environment and genetic potentials of the advocates of freedom and dignity cause them to resist the reality that their own activities are deterministically grounded. [[J. E. R. Staddon]] (''The New Behaviorism'', 2001) has argued the [[Compatibilism|compatibilist position]], that Skinner's determinism is not in any way contradictory to traditional notions of reward and punishment, as he believed.&lt;ref&gt;Staddon, J. (1995) On responsibility and punishment.  ''The Atlantic Monthly'', Feb., 88-94. Staddon, J.  (1999) On responsibility in science and law. ''Social Philosophy and Policy'', 16, 146-174. Reprinted in ''Responsibility''. E. F. Paul, F. D. Miller, &amp; J. Paul (eds.), 1999. Cambridge University Press, pp. 146-174.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Noam Chomsky ===
Perhaps Skinner's best known critic, [[Noam Chomsky]], published a [[Verbal_Behavior#Chomsky.27s_review|review]] of Skinner's ''[[Verbal Behavior (book)|Verbal Behavior]]'' two years after it was published. The review (1959) became better known than the book itself.&lt;ref name=&quot;HP&quot;/&gt; Chomsky's review has been credited with launching the [[cognitive science|cognitive]] movement in psychology and other disciplines&lt;!-- &lt;ref&gt;see Chomsky page for citation&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;. Skinner, who rarely responded directly to critics, never formally replied to Chomsky's critique. Many years later, [[Kenneth MacCorquodale]]'s reply&lt;ref name=&quot;KMC&quot;&gt;[http://www.behavior.org/computer-modeling/maccorquodale/maccorquodale-1970.cfm On Chomsky's Review of Skinner’s Verbal Behavior]&lt;/ref&gt; was endorsed by Skinner.

Chomsky also reviewed Skinner's ''Beyond Freedom and Dignity'', using the same basic motives as his ''Verbal Behavior'' review. Among Chomsky's criticisms were that Skinner's laboratory work could not be extended to humans, that when it was extended to humans it represented '[[Scientism|scientistic]]' behavior attempting to emulate science but which was not scientific, that Skinner was not a scientist because he rejected the [[hypothetico-deductive model]] of theory testing, and that Skinner had no science of behavior.&lt;ref&gt;A. N. Chomsky, (1972) &quot;The Case Against B. F. Skinner.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The fields of [[Relational Frame Theory]] and [[ACT Therapy]] are currently attempting to deal with most of these suggestions.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

=== Anthony Burgess ===
Some see [[Anthony Burgess]]'s novel, ''[[A Clockwork Orange]]'', as criticizing Skinner's theories as being immoral, claiming that moral choice is a necessary part of one's humanity. The novel's protagonist, Alex, believes he can be released from prison early by participating in an [[Ivan Pavlov]] inspired rehabilitation program referred to as the &quot;[[Ludovico technique]]&quot;, which conditions criminals to become nauseous from the mere thought of violence. This stimulus/response approach is claimed to be at odds with Skinner's operant model and his findings that punishment is unlikely to alter behavior. As Skinner was the key behavioural psychologist working at the time of the book's release, he has been included in some discussions of the book's critique.  Indeed within the narrative, the prison chaplain warns against the program, declaring that an action is only good if derived from good intentions rejecting any conditioning, other than that based on moral beliefs, as dehumanizing and oppressive.

He was most recently the head men's basketball coach at [[Texas Tech University|Texas Tech]] before announcing his [[retirement]] on February 4, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://lubbockonline.com/stories/020408/loc_243647726.shtml|title=Exclusive: Knight speaks about retirement decision|publisher=[[Lubbock Avalanche-Journal]]|accessdate=2008-02-04|date=2008-02-04|author=Walker, Jeff}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was previously the head coach at [[Indiana University Bloomington|Indiana University]] and at the [[United States Military Academy|United States Military Academy at West Point]].

From 1971&amp;ndash;2000, Knight coached the [[Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball|Indiana Hoosiers]], where he led his teams to three [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA championships]], one [[National Invitation Tournament]] (NIT) championship, and 11 [[Big Ten Conference]] championships. He received the National Coach of the Year honor four times and the Big Ten Coach of the Year honor six times.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.redraiders.com/coach/mbball/mbball_hcoach.shtml RedRaiders.com]{{dead link|date=October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984, he coached the [[USA men's national basketball team|USA men's Olympic team]] to a gold medal, becoming one of only three basketball coaches to win an NCAA title, NIT title, and an Olympic gold medal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsnetwork.com/default.asp?c=sportsnetwork&amp;page=cbask/news/AEN4127975.htm |title=Bob Knight resigns |publisher=Sportsnetwork.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Knight was one of college basketball's most successful, but also one of its most controversial coaches. He famously threw a chair across the court during a game, was once arrested for [[assault]], and regularly displayed a combative nature during encounters with members of the press. On the other hand, Knight has been praised for running clean programs (none of his teams were ever sanctioned by the NCAA for recruiting violations) and graduating most of his players. Knight also still commands a following among fans of the Indiana Hoosiers basketball program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=11:50 p.m. ET |url=http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/23171291 |title=Pat Knight to mine for players in Indiana |publisher=Nbcsports.msnbc.com |date=2008-02-15 |accessdate=2010-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Knight joined [[ESPN]] as a men's [[ESPN College Basketball broadcast teams|college basketball]] studio analyst during Championship Week and for coverage of the NCAA Tournament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/news/story?id=3269476 |title=Bob Knight joins ESPN for Championship Week and NCAA Tournament |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date=2008-02-29 |accessdate=2010-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the [[2008-09 NCAA Division I men's basketball season|2008&amp;ndash;09 season]], he joined ESPN as a part-time color commentator as well as continuing his studio analyst duties.

==Biography==
===Playing career===
Knight was born in [[Massillon, Ohio]] and grew up in [[Orrville, Ohio]].&lt;ref name=&quot;www2.indystar.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.indystar.com/library/factfiles/people/k/knight_bob/knight.html |title=Bob Knight |publisher=.indystar.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Knight began his career as a player at [[Orrville High School]]. He continued under [[Basketball Hall of Fame]] coach [[Fred R. Taylor|Fred Taylor]] at [[Ohio State University]] in 1958. He was a reserve forward on the [[Ohio State Buckeyes men's basketball|Buckeyes']] [[1960 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1960 national championship]] team, which featured future Hall of Fame players [[John Havlicek]] and [[Jerry Lucas]]. In addition to lettering in basketball at Ohio State, it has been claimed that Knight also lettered in football and baseball;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/bob-knight-at.htm |title=Howstuffworks &quot;Bob Knight&quot; |publisher=Entertainment.howstuffworks.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, the official list of Ohio State football letter earners does not include Knight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://admin.xosn.com/fls/17300//pdf/fb/m-footbl-letterwinners.pdf?SPSID=87751&amp;SPID=10408&amp;DB_OEM_ID=17300 |title=Tradition and History: Ohio State Letterwinners |work=Ohio State 2007 Spring Football Media Guide |publisher=Ohio State University Athletics |format=PDF |page=148 |accessdate=2007-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Knight graduated with a degree in history and government in 1962.

===Coaching career===
====Army====
After graduation in 1962, Knight coached junior varsity basketball at [[Cuyahoga Falls High School]] in Ohio for one year.&lt;ref name=&quot;deford&quot;&gt;{{cite news|publisher=[[Sports Illustrated]]|last=Deford|first=Frank|title=The Rabbit Hunter|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2006/magazine/12/28/knight.flashback/|date=1981-01-26|accessdate=2008-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Knight then enlisted in the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] and accepted an assistant coaching position at [[United States Military Academy|Army]] in 1963, where, two years later, he was named the head coach at the relatively young age of 24. In six seasons at West Point, Knight won 102 games, with his first as a head coach coming against [[Worcester Polytechnic Institute]]. One of his players was Hall of Fame and current [[Duke Blue Devils men's basketball|Duke Blue Devils]] head coach [[Mike Krzyzewski]].

====Indiana====
Knight was noticed as a rising star{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}, and when [[Indiana University Bloomington|Indiana University]] was seeking a new coach in 1971, they turned to Knight. Knight was given the nickname &quot;The General&quot; by former [[Detroit Titans men's basketball|University of Detroit]] and [[Detroit Pistons]] coach-turned-broadcaster [[Dick Vitale]].

Indiana reached the Final Four in 1973, losing to [[1972–73 UCLA Bruins men's basketball team|UCLA]]. In [[1974–75 Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball team|1975]], the Hoosiers were undefeated and the number one team in the nation, when leading scorer [[Scott May]] suffered a broken arm in a win over arch-rival [[Purdue Boilermakers men's basketball|Purdue]]. Indiana subsequently lost 92–90 to [[1974–75 Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball team|Kentucky]] in the regional finals of the [[1975 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|NCAA tournament]], with May playing with a heavily-braced arm.

In [[1975–76 Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball team|1976]], the Hoosiers were undefeated at 32&amp;ndash;0 and won [[1976 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|the championship]], beating [[1975–76 Michigan Wolverines men's basketball team|Michigan]] 86–68 in the title game. Immediately after the game, Knight lamented that &quot;it should have been two.&quot; No other [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] men's team has had an undefeated season including a championship since.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

Knight's Hoosiers also won championships in [[1981 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1981]], with future [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] and Hall of Fame [[point guard]] [[Isiah Thomas]], beating North Carolina 63–50; and in [[1987 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1987]] with guard [[Steve Alford]], beating [[Syracuse Orange men's basketball|Syracuse]] 74&amp;ndash;73 on a last-second shot by [[Keith Smart]].
{{quote box|quote=&quot;When my time on Earth is gone, and my activities here are past, I want they bury me upside down, and my critics can kiss my ass.&quot;|source=—''Attributed to Bob Knight, March 1994''&lt;ref name=LarryKingLive&gt;{{cite episode| title = Why Has Texas Tech Hired Bobby Knight? |transcripturl=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0103/26/lkl.00.html |series = Larry King Live |serieslink=Larry King Live |airdate = 2001-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;|width=20%|align=right}}
Indiana won the [[1979 National Invitation Tournament|1979 NIT]] championship, and Knight led the [[United States men's national basketball team|U.S. national team]] to a gold medal in the [[1984 Summer Olympic Games|Olympic Games]] as coach of the [[Michael Jordan]]-led [[Basketball at the 1984 Summer Olympics|1984]] team (coaches do not receive medals in the Olympics). He also won 11 Big Ten Conference titles. Knight is one of only three coaches to win NCAA, NIT, and Olympic championships, joining [[Dean Smith]] of [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball|North Carolina]], and [[Pete Newell]] of [[California Golden Bears|California]]. Knight is the only coach to win the NCAA, the NIT, the Olympic Gold and the Pan-Am Gold.

The Indiana Hoosiers were undefeated in Big Ten Conference play from 1974 to 1976, and lost only one game during the period (the aforementioned regional final against Kentucky).

In 1991, Knight was elected to the Basketball Hall of Fame in his second year of eligibility. After he wasn't elected in his first year of eligibility, Knight told the committee to take his name off the list, but they denied his request {{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}.

=====&quot;Zero tolerance&quot;=====
On March 14, 2000, just before Indiana was to begin play in the NCAA tournament, the CNN/SI network ran a piece on Knight in which former player Neil Reed claimed he was choked by Knight in a 1997 practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Knight Tape: Video captures encounter between IU coach, ex-player|publisher=[[CNN Sports Illustrated]]|date=2000-09-09|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/thenetwork/news/2000/04/11/knight_cnnsi/|accessdate=2008-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Knight denied the claims in the story. However, on April 11, 2000, [[CNN Sports Illustrated]] aired a tape of an IU practice from 1997 that showed Knight with his hand around the neck of Neil Reed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fired&quot;&gt;[http://archives.cnn.com/2000/US/09/11/knight.protest.02 CNN.com - Fired Bob Knight calms angry student demonstrators - September 11, 2000]{{dead link|date=October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May of that year, Indiana University president [[Myles Brand]] announced that he had adopted a &quot;zero tolerance&quot; policy with regard to Bob Knight's behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.indystar.com/library/factfiles/people/k/knight_bob/knight.html |title=Bob Knight - Former Indiana University basketball coach |publisher=.indystar.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Termination from Indiana=====
In September 2000, IU [[first year|freshman]] Kent Harvey reportedly said, &quot;Hey, Knight, what's up?&quot; to Knight. According to Harvey, Knight then grabbed him by the arm and lectured him for not showing proper respect.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fired&quot; /&gt;

Brand stated that this incident was only one of numerous complaints that occurred after the zero-tolerance policy had been placed on Knight. He asked Knight to resign on September 10. When Knight refused, however, he then relieved Knight of his duties immediately. That evening, a crowd of thousands of students swarmed Bloomington in protest, burning Brand in effigy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fired&quot; /&gt;

Harvey was supported by some and vilified by many who claim he intentionally set up Knight. Kent Harvey's stepfather, Mark Shaw, is a former Bloomington-area radio talk show host and Knight critic.&lt;ref&gt;Threats Follow Knight Dismissal - http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2000/09/11/sports/main232140.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; Knight's supporters contend he was the victim of a media smear campaign organized by enemies in the IU administration and that the majority of Brand's reasons for firing Knight were not credible. However, Knight has said he didn't think he was set up.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

The following day, September 11, Knight said goodbye to a crowd of some 6,000 supporters at Indiana University. He asked that they not hold a grudge against Harvey and that they let Harvey get on with his education and his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/bobknight_farewell |title=Internet Archive: Details: Coach Bob Knight's Farewell Address to Indiana University |publisher=Archive.org |date= |accessdate=2010-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Knight's firing made national headlines including the cover of ''Sports Illustrated'' and around the clock coverage on ESPN. It was also mentioned on major news programs such as CBS News and CNN.

After taking the next season off, all the while on the lookout for vacancies, Knight accepted the head coaching job at Texas Tech, though his hiring was opposed by a group of faculty led by [[Walter Schaller]].&lt;ref name=&quot;The New York Times&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C04E4D7163DF936A25750C0A9679C8B63 | work=The New York Times | title=COLLEGE BASKETBALL; At Texas Tech, Some Professors Balk at Knight | first=Liz | last=Robbins | date=2001-03-15 | accessdate=2010-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the press conference introducing him, Knight quipped, &quot;This is without question the most comfortable red sweater I've had on in six years.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Drape |first=Joe |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C05E6D9123CF937A15750C0A9679C8B63&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss |title=COLLEGE BASKETBALL; Texas Tech Will Be Knight's New Home |publisher=New York Times |date=2001-03-24 |accessdate=2010-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Knight quickly improved the program, which had not been to an NCAA tournament since 1996. He led the [[Texas Tech Red Raiders men's basketball|Red Raiders]] to postseason appearances in each of his first four years at the school (three NCAA Championship tournaments and one NIT). After a rough 2006 season, the team improved in 2007, finishing 21–13 and again making it to the NCAA Championship tournament, where it lost to [[Boston College Eagles basketball|Boston College]] in the first round. The best performance by the Red Raiders under Knight came in 2005 when they advanced as far as the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|Sweet Sixteen]]. In both 2006 and 2007 under Knight, Texas Tech defeated two Top 10-ranked teams in consecutive weeks. During Knight's first six years at Texas Tech, the Red Raiders won 126 games, an average of 21 wins per season.

Knight has a high regard for education and has made generous donations to Texas Tech. On November 29, 2007, the Tech library honored this with A Legacy of Giving: The Bob Knight Exhibit. When Knight came to the school in 2001, he gave $10,000, the first gift to the Coach Knight Library Fund which has now collected over $300,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.www.dailytoreador.com/media/storage/paper870/news/2007/11/30/LaVida/A.Knights.Tale.Tech.Library.Honors.Coach.Knight.For.Donations.Generosity-3124358.shtml?reffeature=htmlemailedition |title=A Knight's Tale: Tech library honors coach Knight for donations, generosity - La Vida |publisher=Media.www.dailytoreador.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 4, 2008, Bob Knight retired as head coach of the Texas Tech Red Raiders. His son [[Pat Knight]], the head coach designate since 2005, was immediately named as his successor. The younger Knight stated that, after many years of coaching, his father was exhausted and ready to retire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2008/writers/seth_davis/02/05/davis.night/|title='He was just worn out':Pat Knight sheds light on father's decision to leave|publisher=[[Sports Illustrated]]|accessdate=2008-02-05|date=2008-02-05|author=Davis, Seth}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just after achieving his 900th win, Knight handed the job over to Pat in the mid-season in part to allow him to get acquainted with coaching the team earlier, instead of having him wait until October, the start of the next season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2008/writers/seth_davis/02/05/davis.night/ | work=CNN | title=Pat Knight sheds light on father's decision to leave | date=2008-02-05 | accessdate=2010-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Knight's biographer, Bob Hammel, Knight is expected to continue living in Lubbock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/05/sports/ncaabasketball/05knight.html?_r=1&amp;hp&amp;oref=slogin|title=Bob Knight Resigns as Coach of Texas Tech|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=2008-02-04|date=2008-02-04|author=Evans, Thayer and Pete Thamel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basketball philosophy==
Bob Knight's [[motion offense]] emphasizes post players setting screens and perimeter players passing the ball until a teammate becomes open for an uncontested [[Jump shot (basketball)|jump shot]] or [[lay-up]]. This requires players to be unselfish, disciplined, and effective in the setting and use of [[screen (basketball)|screens]] to get open. On defense, players are required both to tenaciously guard opponents man-to-man and to help teammates when needed, although Knight has also incorporated using a zone defense periodically after eschewing that defense for the first two decades of his coaching career.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tribute&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.knight880.com/special/stories/quotes.shtml |title=Tribute to Coach Bob Knight present by the '&amp;#39;Lubbock-Avalanche-Journal'&amp;#39; |publisher=Knight 880 |date= |accessdate=2010-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coaching victories and awards==
On January 1, 2007, Knight achieved his 880th career win at Texas Tech, passing retired North Carolina coach [[Dean Smith]] for the most career [[NCAA Division I]] men's college basketball victories. The game was a 70&amp;ndash;68 victory by the Red Raiders over the [[New Mexico Lobos basketball|New Mexico Lobos]]. Knight trails both Adolph Rupp and Dean Smith in win differential, which is the difference between wins and losses and reflects Knight's lower lifetime winning percentage, as it took Knight 41 seasons and 100 extra games to achieve the record, compared with Smith's 36. However, Knight overtook Smith at a younger age (he was also one of the youngest or the youngest to reach milestones 200 (age 35), 300 (age 40), 400 (age 44), 500 (age 48) and 600 (age 52).) Knight chalked up win number 900 when the Red Raiders defeated the ninth-ranked [[2007-08 Texas A&amp;M Aggies men's basketball team|Texas A&amp;M Aggies]], 68–53, on January 16, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://chicagosports.chicagotribune.com/sports/college/cs-17-4pbjan17,1,5383186.story?coll=cs-college-print | work=Chicago Tribune | title=FREE Cubs &amp; Sox apps}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Knight is also the only coach to win the NCAA, the NIT, the [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] Gold, and the [[Pan American Games]] Gold.&lt;ref name=&quot;ESPY&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://texastech.cstv.com/sports/m-baskbl/spec-rel/062707aad.html | title=Bob Knight nominated for ESPY Award | publisher=CSTV.com | date=2007-06-27 | accessdate=2007-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Red Raiders' participation in the [[2007 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament]] marked another record. With their inclusion as the #10 seed in the East Regional, Knight became the coach to lead his team to more NCAA Tournaments than any other.&lt;ref name=&quot;ESPY&quot; /&gt; However, the team lost to Boston College in the first round by a score of 84–75.

In 1987, Knight was the first person to be honored with the [[Naismith College Coach of the Year|Naismith Men's College Coach of the Year Award]]. Five years later, he received the [[Clair Bee Coach of the Year Award]]. And, in 2007, he was the recipient of the [[Naismith Outstanding Contribution to Basketball|Naismith Award for Men's Outstanding Contribution to Basketball]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Naismith&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://media.www.dailytoreador.com/media/storage/paper870/news/2007/03/30/Sports/Knight.To.Receive.Naismith.Award-2813903.shtml?reffeature=htmlemailedition | title=Knight to receive Naismith award | publisher=[[The Daily Toreador]] | date=2007-03-30 | accessdate=2007-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Knight was nominated to receive a 2007 [[ESPY Awards|ESPY Award]] in the category of Best Record Breaking Performance but was not chosen as the winner.&lt;ref name=&quot;ESPY&quot; /&gt;

On May 29, 2008, [[United States Military Academy|Army]] [[Athletic Director]] Kevin Anderson announced that Knight would be one of ten persons inducted into the Army Sports Hall of Fame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://texastech.cstv.com/sports/m-baskbl/spec-rel/052908aaa.html|title=Bob Knight Highlights Hall of Fame Class of 2008|accessdate=2008-05-29|publisher=Texas Tech Athletics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 20, 2008, Bob Knight was inducted into the [[United States Military Academy|Army]] Sports Hall of Fame Class of 2008 in a ceremony during Army's home football game against [[University of Akron|Akron]], at [[Michie Stadium]], [[United States Military Academy|West Point, New York]].

A number of assistant coaches, players, and managers of Knight have gone on to be coaches.

==Controversies==
&lt;!--Any unsourced or poorly sourced material added to this section will be removed immediately per biographies of living persons policy. See Talk page for more details. --&gt;

===1970s===
*It was reported (although years after the incident) that Knight choked and punched IU's longtime sports information director, Kit Klingelhofer, in the 1970s, over a news release that upset the coach.&lt;ref name=&quot;www2.indystar.com&quot;/&gt;

*During the 1979 Pan American Games in San Juan, Puerto Rico, Knight was accused of assaulting a police officer while coaching the US Basketball team before a practice session. He was later convicted in absentia to a six-month jail sentence, but extradition efforts by the Puerto Rican government were not successful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/classic/biography/s/Knight_Bob.html |title=ESPN Classic Sportscentury Biography |publisher=Espn.go.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1980s===
*In February 1985, Knight threw a chair across the court to protest a referee's call during a game against the rival [[Purdue Boilermakers men's basketball|Purdue Boilermakers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/almanac/video/1985/bobby.knight/85.knight.mov |title=CNNSI video archive of chair-throwing event in Quicktime |date= |accessdate=2010-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Knight was suspended for one game and received two years' probation from the Big Ten Conference.

*Women's groups nationwide were outraged by Knight's comments during an April 1988 interview with [[Connie Chung]] in which he said, &quot;I think that if rape is inevitable, relax and enjoy it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/college/mensbasketball/big12/2006-11-14-knight-timeline_x.htm | work=USA Today | title=Bob Knight's outburst timeline | date=2006-11-14 | accessdate=2010-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Knight's comment was in reference to an Indiana basketball game in which he felt the referees were making poor calls against the Hoosiers.

===1990s===
*In March 1992 prior to the NCAA regional finals, controversy erupted after Knight playfully mock whipped Indiana players [[Calbert Cheaney]] and Pat Graham during practice. The bullwhip had been given to Knight as a gift from his team. Several black leaders complained at the racial connotations of the act (Cheaney is black.) &lt;ref&gt;(''Knight: My Story'', pg. 297.)&lt;/ref&gt;

*Knight was shown berating an NCAA volunteer at a March 1995 post-game press conference following a 65&amp;ndash;60 loss to Missouri in the first round of the NCAA tournament held in Boise, Idaho. The volunteer, Rance Pugmire, informed the press that Knight would not be attending the press conference, when in reality, Knight was running a few minutes late and had planned on attending per NCAA rules. Knight was shown saying: &quot;You've only got two people that are going to tell you I'm not going to be here. One is our SID [Sports Information Director], and the other is me. Who the hell told you I wasn't going to be here? I'd like to know. Do you have any idea who it was?...Who?...They were from Indiana, right?...No, they weren't from Indiana, and you didn't get it from anybody from Indiana, did you?...No, I—I'll handle this the way I want to handle it now that I'm here. You (EXPLETIVE) it up to begin with. Now just sit there or leave. I don't give (EXPLETIVE) what you do. Now back to the game.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/page2/tvlistings/show3transcript.html |title=ESPN.com - Page2 - Outside the Lines - Bob Knight: The Final Crisis? |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Former IU player Neil Reed alleged that Knight had grabbed him by the neck in a choking manner during a 1997 practice. A videotape of the incident was shown on CNN.&lt;ref name=&quot;www2.indystar.com&quot;/&gt;

===2000s===
*On February 19, 2000, Clarence Doninger, Knight's boss, alleged to have been physically threatened by the coach during a confrontation after a game.&lt;ref name=&quot;www2.indystar.com&quot;/&gt;

*An IU investigation inquired about an allegation in which Knight berated and physically intimidated a university secretary, once throwing a potted plant in anger, showering her with glass and debris. The University later asked the coach to issue an apology to the secretary.&lt;ref name=&quot;www2.indystar.com&quot;/&gt;

*It was alleged that Knight attacked assistant coach Ron Felling, throwing him out of a chair after overhearing him criticizing the basketball program in a phone conversation.&lt;ref name=&quot;www2.indystar.com&quot;/&gt;

*On September 8, 2000, IU freshman Kent Harvey told campus police Knight grabbed him roughly by the arm and berated him for speaking to the coach disrespectfully. Knight admitted putting his hand on the student's arm and lecturing him on civility, but denied that he was rough or raised his voice. The coach was fired from IU two days later.&lt;ref name=&quot;www2.indystar.com&quot;/&gt;

*Two days after Knight was fired from Indiana University, [[Jeremy Schaap]] of [[ESPN]] interviewed him and discussed his time at Indiana. Towards the end of the interview, Knight talked about his son, Patrick, who had also been dismissed by the university, wanting an opportunity to be a head coach. Schaap, thinking that Knight was finished, attempted to move on to another subject, but Knight insisted on continuing about his son. Schaap repeatedly tried to ask another question when Knight shifted the conversation to Schaap's style of interviewing, notably chastising him about interruptions. Knight then commented (referring to Schaap's father, [[Dick Schaap]]), &quot;You've got a long way to go to be as good as your dad!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.indystar.com/library/factfiles/people/k/knight_bob/interview.html|title=Bob Knight interview|work=[[The Indianapolis Star]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In March 2006, a student's heckling at [[Baylor University]] resulted in Knight having to be restrained by a police officer. The incident was not severe enough to warrant any action from the [[Big 12 Conference]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author=Keith Whitmire | url=http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/spt/colleges/texastech/stories/030306dnspoknight.1c4691b0.html | title=Big 12 won't take action against Knight | publisher=[[The Dallas Morning News]] | date=2006-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*On November 13, 2006, Knight was shown allegedly hitting player Michael Prince under the chin to get him to make eye contact. Although Knight didn't comment on the incident afterwards and as of yet hasn't done so, Prince, his parents, and Texas Tech Athletic Director [[Gerald Myers]] insisted that Knight did nothing wrong and that he merely lifted Prince's chin and told him &quot;Hold your head up and don't worry about mistakes. Just play the game.&quot; Prince commented, &quot;He was trying to teach me and I had my head down so he raised my chin up. He was telling me to go out there and don't be afraid to make mistakes. He said I was being too hard on myself.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;controversy&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/sports/chad/4350211.html | title=Viewing the Knight file, through fact and fiction | author=Chad, Norman | publisher=Houston Chronicle | date=2006-11-20 | accessdate=2007-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*On October 21, 2007, James Simpson of [[Lubbock, Texas]], accused Knight of firing a shotgun in his direction after he yelled at Knight and another man for hunting too close to his home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author=Brandon George | url=http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/spt/stories/112907dnspoknight.4acb07d7.html | title=Bob Knight's hunting dispute on video | work=[[The Dallas Morning News]] | date=2007-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Knight denied the allegations. An argument between the two men was recorded via camera phone and aired later on television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bob Knight confronted during hunting trip|work=[[The Dallas Morning News]]|date=2008-02-04|url=http://www.dallasnews.com/video/dallasnews/sports/index.html?nvid=196646|accessdate=2008-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On December 17, 2009 Knight insulted longtime rival [[University of Kentucky|Kentucky]] and its [[Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball|basketball]] coach [[John Calipari]], saying &quot;We've gotten into this situation where integrity is really lacking and that's why I'm glad I'm not coaching,&quot; he said. &quot;You see we've got a coach at Kentucky, who put two schools &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[UMass Minutemen basketball|UMass]] and [[Memphis Tigers basketball|Memphis]] ] on probation and he's still coaching. I really don't understand that.&quot;
* On April 18, 2011 video surfaced showing Knight responding to a question concerning John Calipari and the University of Kentucky men's basketball team by stating that in the previous season, Kentucky made an Elite Eight appearance the year before with &quot;5 players who had not attended a single class that semester.&quot; These claims were easily disproved by the University and the five players in question, including Patrick Patterson, who graduated in three years, and John Wall, who finished the semester in question with a 3.5 GPA. The Kentucky fanbase demanded an apology from Knight, which he gave on April 19th through his employer, ESPN.

==Books about Bob Knight==
Books about Knight include ''[[A Season on the Brink]]'' (ISBN 0-02-537230-0), by [[John Feinstein]]; ''Bob Knight: His Own Man'', by Joan Mellen (ISBN 0-380-70809-4); and ''Playing for Knight: My Six Seasons with Bobby Knight'', (ISBN 0-671-72441-X), by former player and current [[New Mexico Lobos men's basketball|New Mexico]] head basketball coach Steve Alford.

In ''[[Bob Knight, His Own Man]]'', Mellen characterized Feinstein's book as being banal (21).

In 2002, Knight and longtime friend and sports journalist Bob Hammel wrote his [[biography]], ''Knight: My Story'' (ISBN 0-312-31117-6.)

In 2006, ''Bob Knight: An Unauthorized Biography'', written by Steve Delsohn and Mark Heisler, was released. (ISBN 0-7432-4348-X)

==Film and television==
''[[Blue Chips]]'' is a [[1994 in film|1994]] feature film about Pete Bell, a volatile but honest college basketball coach under pressure to win who decides to blatantly violate NCAA rules to field a competitive team after a sub-par season. It starred [[Nick Nolte]] as Bell and NBA star [[Shaquille O'Neal]] as Neon Bodeaux, a once-in-a-lifetime player Bell woos to his school with gifts and other perks. The coach's temper and wardrobe seem to be modeled after Knight's,{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} but at no time has Knight been known to illegally recruit. Knight himself coaches against Nolte in the film's climactic game.

In 2002, veteran character actor [[Brian Dennehy]] portrayed Knight in ''[[A Season on the Brink]]'', a TV film adapted from John Feinstein's book. It was ESPN's first feature-length film.

Knight made a cameo appearance as himself in the 2003 film ''[[Anger Management]]''.

In 2008, Knight appeared in a commercial as part of [[Volkswagen]]'s Das Auto series where Max, a 1964 black [[Volkswagen Beetle|Beetle]] interviews famous people. When Knight talked about Volkswagen winning the best resale value award in 2008, Max replied, &quot;At least one of us is winning a title this year.&quot; This prompted Knight to throw his chair off the stage and walk out saying, &quot;I may not be retired.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Angry Bob Knight Yells At Volkswagen|publisher=Jalopnik|url=http://jalopnik.com/377439/angry-bob-knight-yells-at-volkswagen|accessdate=2008-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Knight also made an appearance in a TV commercial for [[Guitar Hero: Metallica]] with fellow coaches [[Mike Krzyzewski]], [[Rick Pitino]], and [[Roy Williams (coach)|Roy Williams]], in a parody of [[Tom Cruise]] in [[Risky Business]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsobserver.com/sports/story/1464998.html|title=Roy, Coach K take a turn as 'Guitar Heroes'|last=van der Horst|first=Roger|date=2009-03-31|work=[[The News &amp; Observer]]|accessdate=2009-03-31}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Knight produced 3 instructional coaching DVD libraries—on motion offense, man-to-man defense, and instilling mental toughness—with Championship Productions.

A poster of Knight hangs above the desk of character Ron Swanson (played by [[Nick Offerman]]) in the NBC show ''[[Parks and Recreation]]''.

In the ''[[Freakazoid]]'' episode &quot;Hero Boy&quot;, the behavior of Gutierrez's paranoid lackey Jocko was attributed to the fact that he &quot;used to work for Bobby Knight&quot;.

===Knight School===
{{Main|Knight School (TV series)}}
Knight was the central character in a [[reality television|reality show]] for ESPN. The show, titled ''Knight School,'' followed a handful of Texas Tech students as they competed for the right to join the Red Raiders as a non-scholarship player.

'''Black metal''' is an [[Extreme metal|extreme]] subgenre of [[heavy metal music]]. It often uses fast tempos, shrieked vocals, highly distorted guitars played with [[tremolo picking]], [[blast beat]] drumming, [[lo-fi music|raw]] recording, and unconventional song structure.

During the 1980s, a few [[thrash metal]] bands formed a prototype for black metal. This so-called &quot;first wave&quot; included bands such as [[Venom (band)|Venom]], [[Bathory (band)|Bathory]], [[Hellhammer]], [[Celtic Frost]] and [[Sarcófago]].&lt;ref name=&quot;sam&quot;&gt;Dunn, Sam (2005). [http://imdb.com/title/tt0478209/ ''Metal: A Headbanger's Journey''].&lt;/ref&gt; A &quot;second wave&quot; arose in the early 1990s, spearheaded by [[Norway|Norwegian]] bands such as [[Mayhem (band)|Mayhem]], [[Burzum]], [[Darkthrone]], [[Immortal (band)|Immortal]] and [[Emperor (band)|Emperor]]. This scene developed the black metal style into a distinct genre.

Black metal has been met with hostility from mainstream culture, mainly due to the [[misanthropy|misanthropic]] and [[Anti-Christian sentiment|anti-Christian]] standpoint of many artists. Moreover, a few of the genre's pioneers have been linked with [[Black metal#Church burnings|church burnings]], [[murder]] or [[National Socialism]]. For these, and other reasons, black metal is often seen as an [[underground music|underground]] form of music.

==Characteristics==
===Instrumentation===
Black metal guitarists usually favor high-pitched guitar tones and a great deal of [[distortion (guitar)|distortion]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Extreme Metal 4&quot;&gt;Kahn-Harris, Keith (2006). ''Extreme Metal: Music and Culture on the Edge'', page 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, the guitar is played with much use of fast [[tremolo picking]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Extreme Metal 4&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;&gt;Campion, Chris (February 20, 2005). [http://arts.guardian.co.uk/features/story/0,,1419364,00.html &quot;In the Face of Death&quot;]. ''[[The Guardian]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;chronicles&quot;&gt;Kalis, Quentin (August 31, 2004). [http://www.chroniclesofchaos.com/Articles/rants/6-668_black_metal_a_brief_guide.aspx &quot;Black Metal: A Brief Guide&quot;]. [[Chronicles of Chaos (webzine)|Chronicles of Chaos]].&lt;/ref&gt; When writing music, guitarists often use [[musical scale|scales]], [[interval (music)|intervals]] and [[guitar chord|chord progressions]] that yield the most [[consonance and dissonance|dissonant]] and ominous sounds. [[Guitar solo]]s and low [[guitar tunings]] are rare in black metal.&lt;ref name=&quot;chronicles&quot;/&gt;

The [[bass guitar]] is rarely used to perform stand-alone melodies. It is not uncommon for the bass guitar to be inaudible&lt;ref name=&quot;chronicles&quot;/&gt; or to [[homophony|homophonically]] follow the bass lines of the electric guitar. Typically, [[drum kit|drumming]] is fast-paced and uses [[Heel-toe technique|double-bass]] and/or [[blast beat]] techniques.

Black metal songs often stray from [[song structure (popular music)|conventional song structure]] and often lack clear verse-chorus sections. Instead, many black metal songs contain lengthy and repetitive instrumental sections.

===Vocals and lyrics===
Traditional black metal vocals take the form of high-pitched shrieks, screams and snarls.&lt;ref name=&quot;Extreme Metal 4&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;chronicles&quot;/&gt; This is in stark contrast to the low-pitched growls of [[death metal]].

The most common and founding lyrical theme is [[Anti-Christian sentiment|opposition to Christianity]]&lt;ref name=&quot;chronicles&quot;/&gt; and other organized religions. As part of this, many artists write lyrics that could be seen to promote [[atheism]], [[antitheism]], [[paganism]] and [[Satanism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Murder Music&quot;&gt;Dome, Michael (2007). ''[http://www.rockworld.tv/MurderMusicPlayer.html Murder Music – Black Metal]''. Rockworld TV.&lt;/ref&gt; The hostility of many secular or pagan black metal artists is in some way linked to the [[Christianization]] of their countries. Other oft-explored themes are [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[nihilism]], [[misanthropy]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Murder Music&quot;/&gt; [[death]] and other dark matters. However, over time, many black metal artists have begun to focus more on topics like the seasons (particularly [[winter]]), [[nature]], [[mythology]], [[folklore]], [[philosophy]] and [[fantasy]].

===Production===
Low-cost production quality was a must for early black metal artists with low budgets, where recordings would often take place in the home or in basements; a notable example of such is the band [[Mayhem (band)|Mayhem]], whose record label [[Deathlike Silence Productions]] would record artists in the basement of the shop [[Early Norwegian black metal scene|Helvete]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Extreme Metal 4&quot;/&gt; However, even when they were able to raise their production quality, many artists chose to keep making [[low fidelity]] (lo-fi) recordings.&lt;ref name=&quot;chronicles&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Murder Music&quot;/&gt; The reason for this was to stay true to the genre's underground roots and to make the music sound more &quot;raw&quot; and &quot;cold&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Murder Music&quot;/&gt; One of the better-known examples of this is the album ''[[Transilvanian Hunger]]'' by [[Darkthrone]] – a band that has been said to &quot;represent the [[DIY ethic|DIY aspect]] of black metal&quot; by Johnathan Selzer of ''Terrorizer'' magazine.&lt;ref name=&quot;Murder Music&quot;/&gt; Many have claimed that, originally, black metal was not meant to attract a big audience.&lt;ref name=&quot;Murder Music&quot;/&gt; Vocalist [[Gaahl]] said that during its early years, &quot;black metal was never meant to reach an audience, it was purely for our own satisfaction&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt;

===Imagery and performances===
[[File:God Seed Hellfest 2009 14.jpg|thumb|left|[[Gaahl]] performing live in 2009.]] Unlike artists of other genres, many black metal artists do not perform concerts. Bands that choose to perform concerts often make use of stage props and theatrics. [[Mayhem (band)|Mayhem]] and [[Gorgoroth]] among other bands are noted for their controversial shows; which have featured impaled animal heads, mock [[crucifixion]]s, [[List of medieval weapons|medieval weaponry]], and band members doused in animal blood.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aftenposten.no/english/local/article723414.ece &quot;Norwegian black metal band shocks Poland&quot;]. ''Aftenposten''. February 4, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Black metal artists often appear dressed in black with [[combat boot]]s, bullet belts, spiked wristbands,&lt;ref name=&quot;Murder Music&quot;/&gt; and [[Cross of St. Peter|inverted crosses]]/[[Sigil of Baphomet|pentagrams]] to reinforce their anti-Christian or anti-religious stance.&lt;ref name=&quot;sam&quot;/&gt; However, the most stand-out trait is their use of [[corpse paint]] – black and white makeup (sometimes mixed with real or fake blood), which is used to create a corpse-like appearance.

In the early 1990s, most pioneering black metal artists used simple [[black-and-white]] pictures or writing on their record covers.&lt;ref name=&quot;billzebub&quot;&gt;Zebub, Bill (2007). ''Black Metal: A Documentary''.&lt;/ref&gt; This could have been meant as a reaction against death metal bands, who at that time had begun to use brightly-colored album artwork.&lt;ref name=&quot;billzebub&quot;/&gt; Most underground black metal artists have continued this style. Bands that ''do not'' use this style usually have album covers that are either atmospheric or provocative; some feature natural or fantasy landscapes (for example [[Burzum]]'s ''[[Filosofem]]'' and [[Emperor (band)|Emperor]]'s ''[[In The Nightside Eclipse]]'') while others are violent, perverted and iconoclastic (for example [[Marduk (band)|Marduk]]'s ''[[Fuck Me Jesus]]'' and [[Dimmu Borgir|Dimmu Borgir's]] ''[[In Sorte Diaboli]]'').

==The first wave==
The first wave of black metal refers to those bands during the 1980s who influenced the black metal sound and formed a prototype for the genre. They were often [[speed metal]] or [[thrash metal]] bands.&lt;ref name=&quot;sam&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sharpe-Young, Garry. ''Metal: The Definitive Guide'', page 208&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Venom live at hellfest.jpg|thumbnail|right|Venom's album, titled ''[[Black Metal (album)|Black Metal]]'' inspired the name of the genre.]]
The term &quot;black metal&quot; was coined by the [[England|English]] band [[Venom (band)|Venom]] with their second album ''[[Black Metal (album)|Black Metal]]'' (1982). Although considered thrash metal rather than black metal by modern standards,&lt;ref name=&quot;Murder Music&quot;/&gt; the album's lyrics and imagery focused more on anti-Christian and Satanic themes than any before it. Their music was fast, unpolished in production and featured raspy grunted vocals. Venom's members also adopted [[pseudonyms]], a practice that would become widespread among black metal musicians.

Another major influence on black metal was the [[Sweden|Swedish]] band [[Bathory (band)|Bathory]], led by Thomas Forsberg (under the pseudonym [[Quorthon]]). Not only was Bathory's music fast, lo-fi and anti-Christian, Quorthon was also the first to use the &quot;shrieked&quot; vocals that came to define black metal. The band played in this style on their first four albums: ''[[Bathory (album)|Bathory]]'' (1984), ''[[The Return of the Darkness and Evil|The Return of Darkness and Evil]]'' (1985), ''[[Under the Sign of the Black Mark]]'' (1987) and ''[[Blood Fire Death]]'' (1988). At the beginning of the 1990s, Bathory pioneered the style that would become known as [[Viking metal]].

Other artists usually considered part of this movement include [[Hellhammer]] and [[Celtic Frost]] (from [[Switzerland]]), [[Sodom (band)|Sodom]] and [[Destruction (band)|Destruction]] (from [[Germany]]),&lt;ref name=&quot;Kill Yourself&quot;&gt;Lahdenpera, Esa. [http://www.fmp666.com/moonlight/mayhem.html Interview with Euronymous]. ''Kill Yourself #2''. August 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bulldozer (band)|Bulldozer]] and [[Death SS]] (from [[Italy]]), [[Tormentor]] (from [[Hungary]]), [[Root (band)|Root]] (from [[Czech Republic]]){{cite}}, [[Mercyful Fate]] (from [[Denmark]]){{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}, [[Sarcófago]] (from [[Brazil]]) and [[Blasphemy (band)|Blasphemy]] (from [[Canada]]).

==The second wave==
{{Main|Early Norwegian black metal scene}}
The second wave of black metal began in the early 1990s and was spearheaded by the Norwegian black metal scene. During 1990–1994 a number of Norwegian artists began performing and releasing a new kind of black metal music; this included [[Mayhem (band)|Mayhem]], [[Thorns (band)|Thorns]], [[Burzum]], [[Darkthrone]], [[Immortal (band)|Immortal]], [[Satyricon (band)|Satyricon]], [[Enslaved (band)|Enslaved]], [[Emperor (band)|Emperor]], [[Dimmu Borgir]], [[Gorgoroth]], [[Ulver]] and [[Carpathian Forest]]. They developed the style of their 1980s forebears as a distinct genre that was separate from thrash metal. This was partly thanks to a new kind of guitar playing developed by 'Blackthorn' (Snorre Ruch) of Thorns/Stigma Diabolicum and 'Euronymous' (Øystein Aarseth) of Mayhem.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; 'Fenriz' of Darkthrone has credited them with this innovation in a number of interviews. He described it as being &quot;derived from Bathory&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;UTLTU&quot;&gt;''[[Until the Light Takes Us]]'' (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; and noted that &quot;those kinds of riffs became the new order for a lot of bands in the '90s&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Revolver&quot;&gt;[http://www.revolvermag.com/features/post/web-exclusive-interview-darkthrones-fenriz-part-2-his-thoughts-on-transilva/ &quot;Web-exclusive interview: Darkthrone's Fenriz (Part 2)&quot;]. ''[[Revolver (magazine)|Revolver]]''. 14 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; As seen below, some members of these Norwegian bands would be responsible for a spate of crimes and controversy, including church burnings and murder. Within this scene, an aggressive anti-Christian mindset became a must for any artists to be finalized as &quot;black metal&quot;. '[[Ihsahn]]' of Emperor believes that this trend may have developed simply from &quot;an opposition to society, a confrontation to all the normal stuff&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ihsahn&quot;&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20080105154202/http://www.geocities.com/emperorblackmetal/ihsahn_interview.htm ''Lords of Chaos'' (1998): Ihsahn interview]&lt;/ref&gt; Visually, the dark themes of their music was complemented with [[corpsepaint]], which became a way for black metal artists to distinguish themselves from other metal bands of the era.&lt;ref name=&quot;Murder Music&quot;/&gt;

In neighboring countries, bands began to adopt the style of the Norwegian scene. In [[Sweden]] this included [[Marduk (band)|Marduk]], [[Dissection (band)|Dissection]], [[Lord Belial]], [[Dark Funeral]], [[Arckanum]], [[Nifelheim]] and [[Abruptum]]. In [[Finland]], there emerged a scene that mixed the black metal style with elements of death metal and [[grindcore]]; this included [[Beherit (band)|Beherit]], [[Archgoat]] and [[Impaled Nazarene]]. Black metal scenes also emerged on the European mainland during the early 1990s - again inspired by the Norwegian scene. In [[Poland]], a scene was spearheaded by [[Graveland]] and [[Behemoth (band)|Behemoth]]. In [[France]], a close-knit group of musicians known as [[Les Légions Noires]] emerged; this included artists such as [[Mütiilation]], [[Vlad Tepes (band)|Vlad Tepes]], Belketre and Torgeist. Bands such as [[Von (band)|Von]], [[Judas Iscariot (band)|Judas Iscariot]], [[Demoncy]] and [[Profanatica]] emerged during this time in the [[United States]], where thrash metal and death metal were more popular among extreme metal fans.

By the mid 1990s, the style of the Norwegian scene was being adopted by bands across the world. Newer black metal bands also began raising their production quality and introducing additional instruments such as [[synthesizer]]s and even full-symphony [[orchestra]]s. For many, this spread and diversification marked the end of the &quot;second wave&quot;.

===Helvete and Deathlike Silence===
[[File:Black metal - graffity in euronymous' basement.jpg|thumb|The basement of Helvete]]
During May–June 1991,&lt;ref&gt;In May or June 1991, according to the Interview with Bård Eithun. ''Lords of Chaos'' (1998), page 66.&lt;/ref&gt; Øystein Aarseth (aka '[[Euronymous]]') of Mayhem opened an independent record store named ''Helvete'' ([[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] for ''[[hell]]'') in [[Oslo]]. Musicians from Mayhem, Burzum, Emperor and Thorns often met there, and it became a prime outlet for black metal records.&lt;ref name=&quot;vybirs&quot;&gt;Grude, Torstein (1998). ''Satan Rides The Media''.&lt;/ref&gt; In its basement, Aarseth founded an [[independent record label]] named [[Deathlike Silence Productions]]. With the rising popularity of his band and others like it, the underground success of Aarseth's label is often credited for encouraging other record labels, that previously refused black metal acts, to then reconsider and release their material.

===Ohlin's suicide===
On 8 April 1991, Mayhem vocalist Per Yngve &quot;Pelle&quot; Ohlin (aka '[[Dead (musician)|Dead]]') committed [[suicide]] in a house shared by the band. While fellow musicians often described Ohlin as a strange and introverted person off-stage, for his on-stage performances he would make himself look like a corpse and would cut his arms while singing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20070823184104/http://www.thetruemayhem.com/interviews/previous/hh-june1998.htm Hellhammer interviewed by Dmitry Basik (June 1998)]&lt;/ref&gt;

He was found with slit wrists and a [[shotgun]] wound to the head; the shotgun was owned by Mayhem guitarist Øystein Aarseth (aka 'Euronymous'). Ohlin's [[suicide note]] read &quot;Please excuse all the blood&quot; and included an apology for firing the weapon indoors. Before calling the police, Aarseth went to a nearby store and bought a disposable camera to photograph the corpse, after re-arranging some items.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20080219135731/http://www.thetruemayhem.com/interviews/previous/hh-lords.htm ''Lords of Chaos'' (1998): Hellhammer interview]&lt;/ref&gt; One of these photographs was later used as the cover of a bootleg live album called ''[[Dawn of the Black Hearts]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20070823184150/http://www.thetruemayhem.com/interviews/previous/hh-sod.htm ''Sounds of Death'' magazine (1998): Hellhammer interview]&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, rumors surfaced that Aarseth made a [[stew]] with pieces of Ohlin's brain and made [[necklace]]s with bits of Ohlin's skull.&lt;ref name=&quot;Murder Music&quot;/&gt; The band later denied the former rumor, but confirmed that the latter was true.&lt;ref name=&quot;Murder Music&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt; Moreover, Aarseth claimed to have given these necklaces to musicians he deemed worthy.&lt;ref name=&quot;sam&quot; /&gt; Mayhem bassist Jørn Stubberud (aka 'Necrobutcher') noted that &quot;people became more aware of the [black metal] scene after Dead had shot himself ... I think it was Dead's suicide that really changed the scene&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thetruemayhem.com/interviews/previous/necro-unrestrained15.htm ''Unrestrained'' magazine #15: Necrobutcher interview]{{dead link|date=March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Church burnings===
[[Image:Bergen, Fantoft2.jpg|thumb|left|The Fantoft stave church. &lt;!-- Please add a picture of one of the churches burning, if possible --&gt;]]

Musicians and fans of the Norwegian black metal scene took part in over 50 [[arsons]] of Christian churches in Norway from 1992 to 1996.&lt;ref name = &quot;vybirs&quot;/&gt; Some of the buildings were hundreds of years old and seen as important historical landmarks. One of the first and most notable was Norway's [[Fantoft stave church]], which police believed was burned by [[Varg Vikernes]] of the one-man band Burzum.&lt;ref name = &quot;vybirs&quot;/&gt; However, Vikernes would not be charged until his arrest for the murder of Øystein Aarseth ('Euronymous') in 1993 (see below). The cover of Burzum's EP ''[[Aske (album)|Aske]]'' (Norwegian for ''ash'') is a photograph of the Fantoft stave church after the arson. The musicians [[Samoth]],&lt;ref name=LOC79&gt;''Lords of Chaos'' (1998), page 79&lt;/ref&gt; [[Faust (musician)|Faust]],&lt;ref name=LOC79/&gt; and [[Hades Almighty|Jørn Inge Tunsberg]]&lt;ref name = &quot;vybirs&quot;/&gt; were also convicted for church arsons.

Today, opinions differ within the black metal community about the legitimacy of such actions. Guitarist [[Infernus]] and former vocalist [[Gaahl]] of the band Gorgoroth have praised the church burnings in interviews, with the latter saying &quot;there should have been more of them, and there will be more of them&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;sam&quot;/&gt; However, [[Necrobutcher]] and [[Kjetil Manheim]] of Mayhem have disapproved of the church burnings, with the latter claiming &quot;It was just people trying to gain acceptance within a strict group [the black metal scene] ... they wanted some sort of approval and status&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;onceuponatime&quot;/&gt;
&lt;!--Please do not remove these tags--&gt;

===Aarseth's murder===
On 10 August 1993, [[Varg Vikernes]] of Burzum murdered Mayhem guitarist Øystein Aarseth (aka '[[Euronymous]]'). On that night, Vikernes and Snorre Ruch of [[Thorns (band)|Thorns]] traveled from [[Bergen]] to Aarseth's apartment in [[Oslo]]. Upon their arrival a confrontation began, which ended when Vikernes fatally stabbed Aarseth. His body was found outside the apartment with 23 cut wounds – two to the head, five to the neck, and 16 to the back.&lt;ref&gt;Steinke, Darcey. &quot;Satan's Cheerleaders&quot; SPIN Magazine, February 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been speculated that the murder was the result of a power struggle, a financial dispute over Burzum records, or an attempt at &quot;out doing&quot; a stabbing in Lillehammer committed the year before by another black metal musician, [[Faust (musician)|Bard 'Faust' Eithun]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ukcrlz&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Steve Huey |url=http://music.yahoo.com/ar-257375-bio |title=Mayhem Mayhem Biography on Yahoo! Music |publisher=Music.yahoo.com |date=1993-08-10 |accessdate=2010-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vikernes claims that Aarseth had plotted to [[torture]] him to death and videotape the event – using a meeting about an unsigned [[contract]] as a pretext.&lt;ref name=&quot;nuokon&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.burzum.org/eng/library/a_burzum_story02.shtml |title=Varg Vikernes - A Burzum Story: Part II - Euronymous |publisher=Burzum.org |date= |accessdate=2010-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the night of the murder, Vikernes claims he intended to hand Aarseth the signed contract and &quot;tell him to fuck off&quot;, but that Aarseth attacked him first.&lt;ref name = &quot;nuokon&quot;/&gt; Vikernes also stated that most of Aarseth's cut wounds were caused by broken glass he had fallen on during the struggle.&lt;ref name = &quot;nuokon&quot;/&gt;

Regardless of the circumstances, Vikernes was arrested within days and in May 1994 was sentenced to 21 years in prison for both the murder and church arsons. Vikernes smiled at the moment his verdict was read and the image was widely reprinted in the news media.&lt;ref name = &quot;nuokon&quot;/&gt; In May 1994, Mayhem finally released the album ''[[De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas]]'', which features Aarseth on [[electric guitar]] and Vikernes on [[bass guitar]]. While granted a brief leave in 2003, Vikernes tried to escape his bonds in [[Tønsberg]], but shortly after he was re-arrested driving a stolen car and carrying various firearms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aftenposten.no/english/local/article655724.ece &quot;Police nab 'The Count' after he fled jail&quot;]. ''Aftenposten''. October 27, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Vikernes was released on [[parole]] in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title= Varg Vikernes ute på prøve | curly=y | url= http://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/artikkel.php?artid=557287 | work= [[Verdens Gang]] | location= Oslo, Norway | agency= [[Norsk Telegrambyrå|NTB]] | date= 10 March 2009 | accessdate= March 10, 2009 | language= Norwegian | archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.vg.no%2Fnyheter%2Finnenriks%2Fartikkel.php%3Fartid%3D557287&amp;date=2009-03-10 | archivedate= 10 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title= Ute av fengsel | url= http://www.dagbladet.no/2009/05/22/nyheter/black_metal/varg_vikernes/6354526/ | work= Dagbladet.no | date= 22 May 2009 | accessdate= 23 May 2009 | language= Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conflict between scenes===
A strong rivalry is said to have existed between Norwegian black metal and [[Swedish death metal]] scenes. [[Fenriz]] and [[Tchort]] have noted that Norwegian black metal musicians were &quot;fed up with the whole death metal scene&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;billzebub&quot;/&gt; and that &quot;death metal was very uncool in Oslo&quot; at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;onceuponatime&quot;&gt;Martin Ledang, Pål Aasdal (2008). ''Once Upon a Time in Norway''.&lt;/ref&gt; A number of times, Euronymous sent [[death threat]]s to the more commercialized death metal groups in Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;onceuponatime&quot;/&gt; Allegedly, a group of Norwegian black metal fans even plotted to kidnap and murder certain Swedish death metal musicians.&lt;ref name=&quot;onceuponatime&quot;/&gt;

A brief &quot;conflict&quot; between Norwegian and Finnish scenes gained some media recognition{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} during 1992 and 1993. Part of this was motivated by seemingly harmless pranks; Nuclear Holocausto of the Finnish band [[Beherit (band)|Beherit]] started to make [[prank call]]s in the middle of the night to [[Samoth]] of Emperor (in Norway) and [[Mika Luttinen]] of Impaled Nazarene (in Finland). The calls consisted of senseless babbling and playing of [[children's music|children's songs]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=The End of a Legend - Isten smokes Holocaust Vengeance out of Beherit | journal=Isten | volume=6 | year=1995 | pages=44–45}}&lt;/ref&gt; although Luttinen believed them to be death threats from Norwegian bands.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

Notably, the album cover of Impaled Nazarene's ''Tol Cormpt Norz Norz Norz'' has &quot;No orders from Norway accepted&quot; and &quot;Kuolema Norjan kusipäille!&quot; (&quot;Death to the assholes of Norway!&quot;) written on the back. The Finnish band Black Crucifixion criticized [[Darkthrone]] as &quot;trendies&quot; due to Darkthrone originally being a death metal band.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=The Oath of the Goat's Black Blood | journal=Sinister Flame | volume=1 | year=2003|pages=28–32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stylistic divisions==
{{Section OR|date=October 2008}}

*'''[[Symphonic black metal]]''' is a style of black metal that uses [[symphony|symphonic]] and [[orchestra]]l elements. This may include the usage of instruments found in symphony orchestras ([[piano]], [[violin]], [[cello]], [[flute]] and keyboards), 'clean' or operatic vocals and guitars with less distortion.&lt;!--Please do not add bands, as there is a list in the main article--&gt;

*'''[[Viking metal]]''' are terms used to describe black metal bands who incorporate various kinds of [[folk music]]. Viking black metal bands focus solely on [[Nordic music|Nordic]] folk music and mythology. Their harsh black metal sound is &quot;often augmented by sorrowful [[keyboard instrument|keyboard]] melodies&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Scandinavian Metal |url={{Allmusic|class=explore|id=style/d11954|pure_url=yes}} |publisher=[[Allmusic]] |accessdate=2008-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vocals are typically a mixture of high-pitched shrieks and 'clean' [[choir|choral]] singing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Rivadavia, Eduardo |title=''Requiem'' review |publisher=[[Allmusic]] |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r280988|pure_url=yes}} |accessdate=2008-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The origin of [[Viking metal]] can be traced to the albums ''[[Blood Fire Death]]'' (1988) and ''[[Hammerheart]]'' (1990) by the Swedish band [[Bathory (band)|Bathory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Rivadavia, Eduardo |title=''Blood Fire Death'' review |publisher=[[Allmusic]] |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p3636/biography|pure_url=yes}} |accessdate=2008-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid 1990s, [[Ireland|Irish]] bands such as [[Cruachan (band)|Cruachan]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Cru Imp&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author=Bolther, Giancarlo |title=Interview with Keith Fay of Cruachan |publisher=Rock-impressions.com |url=http://www.rock-impressions.com/cruachan_inter1e.htm |accessdate=2008-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Primordial (band)|Primordial]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Monger, James Christopher |title=AMG Primordial |publisher=[[Allmusic]] |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p320620|pure_url=yes}} |accessdate=2008-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; began to combine black metal with [[folk music of Ireland|Irish folk music]].

==Ideology==
{{Section OR|date=October 2008}}
Any attempt to lay out the [[ideology]] of a musical genre is bound to generalize to the extent that some traits are unfairly emphasized, while others are laid out which do not apply to all. Nonetheless, black metal is generally [[anti-Christian sentiment|opposed to Christianity]] and supportive of [[individualism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;sam&quot; /&gt; Arguably, this is the only coherent sentiment among black metal artists. In a Norwegian documentary, [[Fenriz]] stated that &quot;black metal is individualism above all&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Norsk Black Metal'' (2003). [[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation]].&lt;/ref&gt; Artists who oppose Christianity tend to promote [[atheism]], [[antitheism]], [[paganism]], or [[Satanism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;sam&quot; /&gt; Some musicians – such as Euronymous, [[Infernus]] and Erik Danielsson – have insisted that Satanism should be foremost.&lt;ref name=&quot;infernus&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.live-metal.net/features_interviews_infernus_gorgoroth.html |title=Interviews:Gorgoroth |publisher=Live-Metal.Net |date= |accessdate=2010-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;watain&quot;&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20071231214052/http://www.geocities.com/flesh_ro/watain.htm Interview with WATAIN]&lt;/ref&gt; Occasionally, artists write lyrics that appear to be [[nihilism|nihilistic]] and [[misanthropy|misanthropic]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Murder Music&quot;/&gt; although it is debatable whether this represents their mentality. In some cases, black metal artists have also espoused [[romantic nationalism]], although the majority of those involved are not outspoken with regard to this. Nonetheless, many black metal artists seek to reflect their surroundings within their music. The documentarist [[Sam Dunn]] noted of the Norwegian scene that &quot;unlike any other heavy metal scene, the culture and the place is incorporated into the music and imagery&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;sam&quot; /&gt;

Regarding the sound of black metal, there are two conflicting groups within the genre – &quot;those that stay true to the genre's roots, and those that introduce progressive elements&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Murder Music&quot;/&gt; The former believe that the music should always be [[minimalism|minimalist]] – performed only with the standard guitar-bass-drums setup and recorded in a [[low fidelity]] style. One supporter of this train of thought is [[Blake Judd]] of [[Nachtmystium]], who has rejected labeling his band black metal for its departure from the genre's typical sound.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailyherald.com/story/?id=208961 &quot;Nachmystium shines black light on black metal&quot;]. ''Daily Herald''. June 20, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; A supporter of the latter is Snorre Ruch of [[Thorns (band)|Thorns]], who stated that modern black metal is &quot;too narrow&quot; and believes that this was &quot;not the idea at the beginning&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.voicesfromthedarkside.de/interviews/thorns.htm Thorns interview]. ''Voices From The Darkside''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some prominent black metal musicians believe that black metal does not need to hold any ideologies. For example, [[Jan Axel Blomberg]] said in an interview with ''Metal Library'' that &quot;In my opinion, black metal today is just music.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hellhammer interview&quot;&gt;Skogtroll (January 7, 2007). [http://translate.google.com/translate?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.metallibrary.ru%2Farticles%2Finterviews%2F96.html&amp;hl=fi&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;sl=ru&amp;tl=en Hellhammer (Jan Axel Blomberg) interview (in Russian (google-translated to English)]. ''Metal Library''. Open Publishing. Retrieved on 2008-06-24.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, [[Sigurd Wongraven]] stated in the ''Murder Music'' documentary that black metal &quot;doesn't necessarily have to be all Satanic, as long as it's dark.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Murder Music&quot;/&gt;

===National Socialist black metal===
{{Main|National Socialist black metal}}
National Socialist black metal (NSBM) is a term used for black metal artists who promote [[Nazism|National Socialist (Nazi)]] beliefs through their music and imagery. NSBM is not regarded as a distinct subgenre, as there is no way to play black metal in a National Socialist way. Some black metal bands have made references to [[Nazi Germany]] for [[shock value]], causing them to be wrongly labeled as NSBM. Due to his writings,&lt;ref name=&quot;burzum.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.burzum.org/eng/library/a_burzum_story07.shtml |title=Varg Vikernes - A Burzum Story: Part VII - The Nazi Ghost |publisher=Burzum.org |date= |accessdate=2010-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Varg Vikernes]] is regarded as the main inspiration for the NSBM movement. Vikernes, however, has tried to distance himself from Nazism and the NSBM scene, preferring to refer to himself as an [[odalist]] instead of a &quot;socialistic&quot;, &quot;materialistic&quot; Nazi.&lt;ref name=&quot;burzum.org&quot;/&gt;

NSBM artists are a small minority within black metal, according to Mattias Gardel.&lt;ref&gt;Gardel, Mattias. [[Gods of the Blood|''Gods of the Blood'' (2003)]]&lt;/ref&gt; They have been criticized by some prominent and influential black metal musicians – including [[Jon Nödtveidt]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Dissection&quot;/&gt; [[Tormentor (musician)|Tormentor]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Tormentor&quot;&gt;Metal Heart 2/00&lt;/ref&gt; [[King ov Hell]],&lt;ref name=&quot;kingovhell&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maelstrom.nu/ezine/interview_iss50_224.php |title=Interview with JOTUNSPOR |publisher=Maelstrom.nu |date= |accessdate=2010-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Infernus]],&lt;ref name=&quot;infernus1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.Net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=93004 |title=GORGOROTH Guitarist INFERNUS: 'I Personally Am Against Racism In Both Thought And Practice' |publisher=Roadrunnerrecords.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lord Ahriman]],&lt;ref name=&quot;billzebub&quot;/&gt; [[Emperor Magus Caligula]],&lt;ref name=&quot;billzebub&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;caligulayoutube&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=d6pYjLyxCHo |title=YouTube - Dark Funeral - Interview (Episode 276) |publisher=Uk.youtube.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Lederer (musician)|Richard Lederer]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Protector&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.summoning.info/Stuff/PoliticalStatements.html |title=Political Statements from Protector (Summoning) |publisher=Summoning.info |date= |accessdate=2010-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael W.

'''Blizzard Entertainment, Inc.''' is an [[United States|American]] [[video game developer]] and [[video game publisher|publisher]] founded on February 8, 1991 under the name '''Silicon &amp; Synapse''' by three [[graduates]] of [[UCLA]], [[Michael Morhaime]], [[Allen Adham]] and [[Frank Pearce (businessman)|Frank Pearce]]. Based in [[Irvine, California]], the company originally concentrated primarily on the creation of game [[Porting|ports]] for other studios before beginning development of their own software in 1993 with the development of games like ''[[Rock N' Roll Racing]]'' and ''[[The Lost Vikings]]''. In 1994 the company became '''Blizzard Entertainment Inc''' before being acquired by distributor [[Davidson &amp; Associates]] and later by [[Vivendi]]. Shortly thereafter, Blizzard shipped their breakthrough hit ''[[Warcraft: Orcs and Humans]]''.
Blizzard went on to create several successful PC games, including the ''[[Warcraft (series)|Warcraft]]'', ''[[Starcraft (series)|Starcraft]]'' and ''[[Diablo (series)|Diablo]]'' series, and the [[MMORPG]] ''[[World of Warcraft]]''.

On July 9, 2008, [[Activision]] officially merged with Vivendi Games, culminating in the inclusion of the Blizzard brand name in the title of the resulting holding company, though Blizzard Entertainment remains a separate entity with independent management.&lt;ref name=&quot;Activision_Blizzard_Close_English&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.activisionblizzard.com/corp/ui/pdf/Activision_Blizzard_Close_English.pdf|title=

Blizzard Entertainment offers events to meet players and to announce games: the [[BlizzCon]] in [[California]], United States, and the [[Blizzard Worldwide Invitational]] in other countries, such as [[Paris, France]] and [[Seoul, South Korea]].

[[Image:BlizzardIrvine.jpg|thumb|left|Blizzard's headquarters in [[Irvine, California|Irvine, CA]]]]
Blizzard Entertainment was founded by [[Michael Morhaime]], [[Allen Adham]], and [[Frank Pearce (businessman)|Frank Pearce]] as '''Silicon &amp; Synapse''' in February 1991, a year after&lt;ref name=&quot;UCLAHonorDinner2006_11_06&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engineer.ucla.edu/newsroom/featured-news/archive/2006/november/ucla-engineering-celebrates-accomplishments-at-annual-awards-dinner |title=

Ports include titles such as ''J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings, Vol. I'' and ''Battle Chess II: Chinese Chess''.&lt;ref name=&quot;blizz_tline&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blizzard.com/blizz-anniversary/timeline.shtml|title=Blizzard Timeline|publisher=Blizzard Entertainment|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.blizzard.com/blizz-anniversary/timeline.shtml|archivedate=2003-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mobygames.com/browse/games/blizzard-entertainment-inc/ported-by/list-games/|title=Ported by Blizzard Entertainment Inc.|publisher=Mobygames}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, the company developed games like ''[[Rock N' Roll Racing]]'' and ''[[The Lost Vikings]]'' (published by [[Interplay Entertainment|Interplay Productions]]).

In early 1994 they were acquired by distributor [[Davidson &amp; Associates]] for $6.75 million.&lt;ref&gt;Dean Takahashi: ''[http://articles.latimes.com/print/1994-03-13/business/fi-33584_1_video-game-development Co-Founder Looks at Chaos in Early Stages and Future Challenges.]'' In: Los Angeles Times, March 13, 1994. - Interview with Allen Adham.&lt;/ref&gt; The same year the company briefly changed its name to '''Chaos Studios,''' before finally settling on Blizzard Entertainment after it was discovered that another company with the Chaos name already existed.&lt;ref&gt;Dean Takahashi: ''[http://articles.latimes.com/print/1994-05-24/business/fi-61596_1_chaos-studios Briefcase: Technology.]'' In: Los Angeles Times, May 24, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter, Blizzard shipped their breakthrough hit ''[[Warcraft: Orcs and Humans]]'' through [[Interplay Productions|Interplay]].

Blizzard has changed hands several times since then: Davidson was acquired along with [[Sierra Entertainment|Sierra On-Line]] by a company called [[CUC International]] in 1996; CUC then merged with a hotel, real-estate, and car-rental franchiser called [[HFS Corporation]] to form [[Cendant]] in 1997. In 1998 it became apparent that CUC had engaged in accounting fraud for years before the merger; Cendant's stock lost 80% of its value over the next six months in the ensuing widely discussed accounting scandal. The company sold its consumer software operations, Sierra On-line which included Blizzard, to [[France|French]] publisher [[Havas]] in 1998, the same year Havas was purchased by [[Vivendi]]. Blizzard was part of the [[Vivendi Games]] group of Vivendi. In July 2008 Vivendi Games merged with [[Activision]], using Blizzard's name in the resulting company, [[Activision Blizzard]].

In 1996, Blizzard acquired Condor Games, which had been working on the game ''[[Diablo (computer game)|Diablo]]'' for Blizzard at the time. Condor was renamed [[Blizzard North]], and has since developed hit games ''[[Diablo (computer game)|Diablo]]'', ''[[Diablo II]]'', and its expansion pack ''[[Diablo II: Lord of Destruction]]''. Blizzard North was located in [[San Mateo, California]]; the company originated in [[Redwood City, California]].

Blizzard launched their online gaming service ''[[Battle.net]]'' in January 1997 with the release of their action-[[role-playing video game|RPG]] ''Diablo''. In 2002, Blizzard was able to reacquire rights for three of its earlier Silicon &amp; Synapse titles from [[Interplay Entertainment]] and re-release them under [[Game Boy Advance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview

On November 23, 2004, Blizzard released World of Warcraft, its [[MMORPG]] offering.

=== Main franchises ===
Currently, Blizzard has three main franchises in the gaming industry: ''[[Warcraft]]'', ''[[Diablo (series)|Diablo]]'', and ''[[StarCraft (series)|StarCraft]]''.

Notable unreleased titles include ''[[Warcraft Adventures: Lord of the Clans]]'', which was cancelled on May 22, 1998, ''Shattered Nations'', and ''[[Starcraft: Ghost]]'', which was &quot;Cancelled&quot; on March 24, 2006 after being in [[development hell]] for much of its lifespan, and whose current status is in question. The company also has a history of declining to set release dates, choosing to instead take as much time as needed, generally saying a given product is &quot;done when it's done.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

''Pax Imperia II'' was originally announced as a title to be published by Blizzard. Blizzard eventually dropped ''Pax Imperia II'', though, when it decided it might be in conflict with their other space strategy project, today known as StarCraft. THQ eventually contracted with Heliotrope and released the game in 1997 as ''[[Pax Imperia: Eminent Domain]]''.

Blizzard Entertainment has announced that they will be producing a [[Warcraft (film)|''Warcraft'' live-action movie]]. The movie will be released by [[Legendary Pictures]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blizzard.com/press/060509.shtml|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060526064526/http://www.blizzard.com/press/060509.shtml|archivedate=2006-05-26|title=Blizzard Entertainment - Press Release|accessdate=2006-08-31|date=2006-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have recently announced that director [[Sam Raimi]] has agreed to direct the upcoming movie.

Blizzard initially responded to some of the concerns by saying that the changes would not be retroactive to previous posts, that parents could set up the system so that minors cannot post, and that posting to the forums is optional.&lt;ref name=&quot;holisky1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Holisky |first=Adam |url=http://wow.joystiq.com/2010/07/06/blizzards-responses-on-the-real-id-situation/ |title=Blizzard's responses on the Real ID situation |publisher=Wow.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; However due to the huge negative response, Blizzard President [[Michael Morhaime]] issued a statement rescinding the plan to use real names on Blizzard's forums for the time being.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?sid=1&amp;topicId=25968987278 World of Warcraft - English (NA) Forums -&gt; Regarding real names in forums]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Warden Client ==
{{Main|Warden (software)}}

Blizzard has made use of a special form of [[software]] known as the 'Warden Client'. The Warden client is known to be used with Blizzard's Online Games such as Diablo and World of Warcraft, and the Terms of Service contain a clause consenting to the Warden software's RAM scans while a Blizzard game is running.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/legal/termsofuse.html WoW -&gt; Legal -&gt; Terms of Use&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Warden client scans a small portion of the [[code segment]] of running processes in order to determine whether any of these third-party programs are running. The goal of this is to detect and address players who may be attempting to cheat in the game. As [[World of Warcraft]] is a [[massively multiplayer online game]], the actions of a few cheaters can greatly affect the experience of the rest of the game's community. This determination of third party programs is made by [[Hash function|hashing]] the scanned [[String (computer science)|strings]] and comparing the hashed value to a list of hashes assumed to correspond to cheat programs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/*hh_/www.rootkit.com/blog.php?newsid=358 rootkit.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The Warden scans all processes running on a computer, not just the World of Warcraft game, and could possibly run across what would be considered private information and other [[personally identifiable information]]. It is because of these peripheral scans that Warden has been accused of being [[spyware]] and has run afoul of controversy among [[privacy]] advocates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://play.tm/news/6837/wow-s-warden-stirs-controversy/ WoW's Warden stirs controversy - news - play&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.antispywarecoalition.org/documents/definitions.htm Definitions and Supporting Documents&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.mmosite.com/content/2006-11-26/20061126193343858.shtml Look! what is Blizzard doing on your pc? - MMOsite News Center&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Warden's reliability in correctly discerning legitimate vs illegitimate actions was called into question when a large scale incident happened when many Linux users were banned after an update to Warden caused it to incorrectly detect [[Cedega (software)|Cedega]] as a cheat program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20080216041937/http://www.linuxlookup.com/2006/nov/15/linux_users_banned_from_world_of_warcraft Linux Users Banned From World of Warcraft? | Linuxlookup&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Blizzard issued a statement claiming they had correctly identified and restored all accounts and credited them with 20 days play.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20080803095822/http://www.linuxlookup.com/2006/nov/22/blizzard_unbans_linux_world_of_warcraft_players Blizzard Unbans Linux World of Warcraft Players | Linuxlookup&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Warden is not the first time Blizzard Entertainment has been accused of attempting to inspect customers' computers. In 1998 Blizzard Entertainment had a class action lawsuit filed against them for &quot;unlawful business practices&quot; for the action of collecting data from a user's computer without their permission.&lt;ref&gt;[http://attrition.org/errata/company/blizzard01.html Errata: Blizzard Entertainment&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal disputes ==
=== FreeCraft ===
{{Main|Stratagus}}

On June 20, 2003, Blizzard issued a [[cease and desist]] letter to the developers of an [[open source]] clone of the Warcraft engine called ''FreeCraft'', claiming [[trademark infringement]]. This hobby project had the same gameplay and characters as ''Warcraft II'', but came with different graphics and music.

As well as a similar name, ''FreeCraft'' enabled gamers to use ''Warcraft II'' graphics, provided they had the ''Warcraft II'' CD. The programmers of the clone shut down their site without challenge. Soon after that the developers regrouped to continue the work by the name of ''[[Stratagus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linuxdevcenter.com/pub/a/linux/2004/07/15/stratagus.html Howard Wen, ''Stratagus: Open Source Strategy Games'' linuxdevcenter.com July 15, 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== World of Warcraft Private Server Complications ===
On December 5, 2008, Blizzard issued a [[cease and desist]] letter to many administrators of high population [[World of Warcraft]] private servers (essentially slightly altered hosting servers of the actual [[World of Warcraft]] game, that players do not have to pay for). Blizzard used the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] to influence many private servers to fully shut down and cease to exist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wow.joystiq.com/2008/12/05/blizzard-legal-targets-private-servers/ Blizzard legal targets private servers] (Accessed Oct. 12, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Founder Electronics infringement lawsuit ===
On August 14, 2007, Beijing University [[Founder Electronics]] Co., Ltd. sued Blizzard Entertainment Limited for copyright infringement claiming 100 million [[Chinese yuan|yuan]] in damages. The lawsuit alleged the Chinese edition of World of Warcraft reproduced a number of Chinese typefaces made by Founder Electronics without permission.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foundertype.com/EN/news/20078151110301.html Founder prosecuting Blizzard online game World of Warcraft Tort Claiming 100 million yuan]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== MDY Industries, LLC v. Blizzard Entertainment, Inc. ===
{{Main|Glider (bot)}}

On July 14, 2008, the U.S. District of Arizona ruled on the case [[MDY Indus. LLC v. Blizzard Entm't, Inc.|MDY Industries, LLC v. Blizzard Entertainment, Inc.]] The Court found that MDY was liable for [[copyright infringement]] since users of its [[glider (bot)|Glider]] bot program were breaking Blizzard's End User License Agreement and Terms of Use. However the case is still being looked over by the courts.

== Battle.net 2.0 ==
Blizzard released its revamped Battle.net service in 2009. This service allows people who have purchased Blizzard products (''[[StarCraft]]'', ''[[StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty|StarCraft II]]'', ''[[Diablo II]]'', and ''[[WarCraft III: Reign of Chaos|Warcraft III]]'', as well as their expansions) to download digital copies of games they have purchased, without needing any physical media. In the future, it will store a player's &quot;Blizzard Level&quot; (similar to a [[Gamerscore]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://multiplayerblog.mtv.com/2008/08/01/blizzard-accounts-achievements/ MTV Multiplayer » Blizzard Plans To Track Gamer Achievements Across ‘WoW,’ ‘Starcraft’ And ‘Diablo’&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 11, 2009, Blizzard required all ''World of Warcraft'' accounts to switch over to Battle.net Accounts. This transition now means that all current Blizzard titles can be accessed, downloaded, and played with a singular Battle.net login.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/index.xml World of Warcraft&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Robert Bellarmine''' (full name in Italian: '''Roberto Francesco Romolo Bellarmino''') (4 October 1542 – 17 September 1621) was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[Jesuit]] and a [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] of the [[Catholic Church]]. He was one of the most important figures in the [[Counter-Reformation]]. He was canonized in 1930 and is a [[Doctor of the Church]]. 

==Biography==
===Early years===
Bellarmine was born at [[Montepulciano]] to a noble &amp;ndash; though impoverished &amp;ndash; family, son of Vincenzo Bellarmino and wife Cinzia Cervini who was sister of [[Pope Marcellus II]]. His abilities showed themselves early; as a boy he knew [[Virgil]] by heart and composed a number of poems in [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[Latin]]. One of his hymns, on [[Mary Magdalene]], is included in the [[Breviary]]. 

His father destined him for a political career, hoping that he might restore the fallen glories of the family. His mother, however, wished him to enter the Society of Jesus, and her influence prevailed. He entered the Roman novitiate in 1560, remaining in Rome three years. He then went to a Jesuit house at [[Mondovì]], in [[Piedmont (Italy)|Piedmont]], where he learned [[Greek language|Greek]].

Bellarmine's systematic study of [[theology]] began at the [[University of Padua]] in 1567 and 1568, where his teachers were [[Thomism|Thomists]]. But in 1569 he was sent to finish it at [[Leuven]], near Brussels, where he could obtain a fuller acquaintance with the prevailing heresies. There he was ordained, and he quickly obtained a reputation both as a professor and a preacher, in the latter capacity drawing to his pulpit both Catholics and Protestants, even from distant parts. 

He was the first Jesuit to teach at the university, where the subject of his course was the ''Summa'' of  [[Thomas Aquinas]]; he also made extensive studies in the Fathers and medieval theologians, which gave him the material for his book ''&quot;De scriptoribus ecclesiasticis&quot;'' (Rome, 1613), which was later revised and enlarged by [[Sirmond]], [[Labbeus]], and Casimir Oudin.

===In Rome &amp;ndash; ''The Disputations''===
Bellarmine's residence in Leuven lasted seven years. His health was undermined by study and asceticism, and in 1576 he made a journey to Italy that it might be restored. Here he was detained by the commission given him by [[Pope Gregory XIII]] to lecture on polemical theology in the new Roman College; Bellarmine saw this as an honour and graciously accepted.
{{Jesuit}}
Bellarmine devoted eleven years to this work, out of whose activities grew his celebrated ''Disputationes de controversiis christianae fidei'' (also called ''[[Disputationes]]''), first published at [[Ingolstadt]] in 1581&amp;ndash;1593. It occupies in the field of dogmatics the same place as the ''Annales'' of [[Baronius]] in the field of history.  This monumental work was the earliest attempt to systematize the various controversies of the time. It made an immense impression throughout Europe, the blow it dealt to Protestantism being so acutely felt in Germany and England that special chairs were founded in order to provide replies to it. Nor has it even yet been superseded as the classical book on its subject-matter, though, as was to be expected, the progress of criticism has impaired the value of some of its historical arguments. 

Both of Bellarmine's great works were the fruits of the revival in religion and learning which the Catholic Church had witnessed since 1540. Both bear the stamp of their period; the effort for literary elegance (so-called ''&quot;maraviglia&quot;''), which was considered the principal thing at the beginning of the sixteenth century, had given place to a desire to pile up as much material as possible, to embrace the whole field of human knowledge, and incorporate it into theology.  

The first volume treats of the Word of [[God]], of [[Christ]], and of the [[pope]]; the second of the authority of [[ecumenical council]]s, and of the Church, whether militant, expectant, or triumphant; the third of the [[sacrament]]s; and the fourth of [[Divine grace]], [[free will]], [[justification (theology)|justification]], and [[good works]].

===New duties after 1589 &amp;ndash; controversial writings===
Until 1589, Bellarmine was occupied altogether as professor of theology, but that date marked the beginning rounded the new pope in his life and of new dignities. After the murder of [[Henry III of France]], [[Pope Sixtus V]] sent Gaetano as legate to Paris to  negotiate with the [[Catholic League (French)|League]], and chose Bellarmine to accompany him as theologian; he was in the city during its siege by [[Henry of Navarre]]. 

The next pope, [[Pope Clement VIII|Clement VIII]], set great store by him. Bellarmine wrote the preface to the new edition of the [[Vulgate]], and was made rector of the Roman College in 1592, examiner of  [[bishop]]s in 1598, and cardinal in 1599. Immediately after his appointment as Cardinal, Pope Clement made him a Cardinal [[Inquisition|Inquisitor]]. In this capacity he served as one of the judges at the trial of [[Giordano Bruno]], and concurred in the decision which condemned him to be [[burned at the stake|burnt to death]] as an obstinate heretic.&lt;ref&gt;Blackwell [[#Reference-Blackwell-1991|(1991, pp.&amp;nbsp;47&amp;ndash;48)]].&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1602 he was made [[archbishop of Capua]]. He had written strongly against pluralism and  non-residence (i.e., a bishop not residing within his diocese), and he set an example himself by leaving within four days for his [[diocese]], where he devoted himself to his episcopal duties, and put into effect the reforming decrees of the [[Council of Trent]]. 

Under [[Pope Paul V]] (reigned 1605&amp;ndash;1621), arose a major conflict between [[Venice]] and the [[Papacy]].  [[Paolo Sarpi]], as spokesman for the Republic of Venice, protested against the papal [[interdict]], and reasserted the principles of the [[Council of Constance]] and of the [[Council of Basel]], denying the pope's authority in secular matters. Bellarmine wrote three rejoinders to the Venetian theologians, and may have warned Sarpi of an impending murderous attack. 

Bellarmine also became involved in controversy with King [[James I of England]]. Bellarmine had written a letter to the English archpriest [[George Blackwell]], reproaching him for having taken the [[oath of allegiance]] in apparent disregard of his duty to the pope. James attacked him in 1608 in a Latin treatise, which the scholarly cardinal answered, making fun of the defects of the royal Latinity. King James replied with a second attack, dedicated to the [[Emperor Rudolph II]] and all the monarchs of [[Christendom]], in which he posed as the defender of primitive and true Christianity. Bellarmine's answer to this covers more or less the whole controversy. 

In 1616, on the orders of the then pope, Paul V, Cardinal Bellarmine summoned [[Galileo Galilei]], notified him of a forthcoming [[decree]] of the [[Congregation of the Index]] condemning the [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernican]] doctrine of the mobility of the Earth and the immobility of the Sun, and ordered him to abandon it.&lt;ref&gt;Blackwell [[#Reference-Blackwell-1991|(1991, p.126)]]. &lt;cite id=disputedinjunction&gt;The Vatican archives contain an unsigned copy of a more strongly worded formal injunction purporting to have been served on Galileo shortly after Bellarmine's admonition, ordering him &quot;not to hold, teach, or defend&quot; the condemned doctrine &quot;in any way whatever, either orally or in writing &quot;, and threatening him with imprisonment if he refused to obey.&lt;/cite&gt;  However, whether this injunction was ever properly served on Galileo is a subject of much scholarly disagreement.[[#Reference-Blackwell-1991|(Blackwell, 1991, p.127&amp;ndash;128)]]&lt;/ref&gt; Galileo agreed.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Fantoli-2005|Fantoli (2005, p.119)]]. Some scholars have suggested that Galileo's agreement was only obtained after some initial resistance. Otherwise, the formal injunction purporting to have been served on him during his meeting with Bellarmine [[#disputedinjunction|(see earlier footnote)]] would have been contrary to the Pope's instructions [[#Reference-Fantoli-2005|(Fantoli. 2005, pp.121, 124)]].&lt;/ref&gt; When Galileo later complained of rumors to the effect that he had been forced to abjure and do penance, Bellarmine wrote out a certificate denying the rumors, stating that Galileo had merely been notified of the decree and informed that, as a consequence of it, the Copernican doctrine could not be &quot;defended or held&quot;. &lt;ref&gt;Blackwell [[#Reference-Blackwell-1991|(1991, p.127)]].  Unlike the previously mentioned formal injunction [[#disputedinjunction|(see earlier footnote)]], this milder restriction would have allowed Galileo to continue using and teaching the mathematical content of Copernicus's theory as a purely theoretical device for predicting the apparent motions of the planets. Maurice Finocchiaro's English translations of the purported [http://classic-web.archive.org/web/20070930013053/http://astro.wcupa.edu/mgagne/ess362/resources/finocchiaro.html#specinj formal injunction], the [http://classic-web.archive.org/web/20070930013053/http://astro.wcupa.edu/mgagne/ess362/resources/finocchiaro.html#indexdecree decree] of the Congregation of the Index and Cardinal Bellarmine's [http://classic-web.archive.org/web/20070930013053/http://astro.wcupa.edu/mgagne/ess362/resources/finocchiaro.html#certificate certificate] are available on-line.&lt;/ref&gt; Cardinal Bellarmine was himself ambiguous about heliocentrism, personally noting that further research had to be done to confirm or condemn it. (In 1633 Galileo would again be called before the Inquisition in this matter.)

In reply to a posthumous treatise of [[William Barclay (jurist)|William Barclay]], the celebrated Scottish jurist, he wrote another ''Tractatus de potestate summi pontificis in rebus  temporalibus'', which reiterated his strong assertions on the subject, and was therefore prohibited in [[France]], where it agreed with the sentiments of neither the king nor the bishops. Another prominent rejection of Bellarmine's claim of papal superior authority was made by philosopher [[Thomas Hobbes]] in the third and fourth book of his [[Leviathan (book)|Leviathan]] - no one else is so often quoted in the whole book than Bellarmine.

In his old age he was allowed to return to his old home, Montepulciano, as its bishop for four years, after which he retired to the Jesuit college of St. Andrew in Rome. He received some votes in the [[papal election|conclaves]] which elected [[Pope Leo XI]], [[Pope Paul V]], and [[Pope Gregory XV]], but only in the second case had he any prospect of election. 

During his retirement, he wrote several short books intended to help ordinary people in their spiritual life: The Mind's Ascent to God (1614), The Art of Dying Well (1619), and The Seven Words on the Cross. 

Bellarmine died in Rome on 17 September 1621.

==Canonization and final resting place==
Over the years, the members of his order worked tirelessly to achieve his canonization. Finally he was [[canonized]] by [[Pope Pius XI]] in 1930; the following year he was declared a [[Doctor of the Church]]. He died from natural causes in Rome, Italy. His body rests in the [[Sant'Ignazio|Church of Saint Ignatius]], the chapel of the Roman College, next to the body of his student, [[St. Aloysius Gonzaga]], as he himself had wished.

==Feast day==
In the [[Roman Catholic calendar of saints]] Saint Robert Bellarmine's [[feast day]] is on 17 September, the day of his death; but some continue to use pre-1969 calendars, in which for 37 years his feast day was on 13 May. The rank attributed to his feast has been &quot;double&quot; (1932&amp;ndash;1959) and its equivalent &quot;third-class feast&quot; (1960&amp;ndash;1968); 1969 it was downgraded to an &quot;optional memorial&quot;.

==Legacy==
[[Bellarmine University]] in [[Louisville, Kentucky]] is named after him.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Bildungsroman''' ({{IPA-de|ˈbɪldʊŋs.ʁoˌmaːn}}; {{lang-de|&quot;formation novel&quot;}}) is a genre of the novel which focuses on the psychological and moral growth of the protagonist from youth to adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;  Change is thus extremely important.&lt;ref&gt;Bakhtin, 1996, p.21. Jeffers, 2005. p.2&lt;/ref&gt; The genre is further characterized by a number of formal, topical and thematic features.&lt;ref&gt;Iversen 2010; [http://hdl.handle.net/10037/2486 ''Change and Continuity'']&lt;/ref&gt; The term coming-of-age novel is sometimes used interchangeably with ''Bildungsroman'', but its use is usually wider and less technical. 

The birth of the ''Bildungsroman'' is normally dated to the publication of [[Goethe|Goethe’s]] ''[[Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship|The Apprenticeship of Wilhelm Meister]]'' in 1795-96.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffers, 2005, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; Although the ''Bildungsroman'' arose in Germany, it has had extensive influence first in Europe and later throughout the world. [[Thomas Carlyle]] translated Goethe’s novel into English, and after its publication in 1824, many British authors wrote novels inspired by it. In the 20th century, the genre has been particularly popular among women and minority writers, and it has spread to numerous countries around the globe.&lt;ref&gt;A wealth of criticism attests to this development. Hirsh and Moretti discuss the ''Bildungsroman'' in Germany, Britain and France. Abel, Hirsh and Langland started the by now enormous critical production on female novels of development. Examples of work on the “ethnic” or non-European ''Bildungsroman'' include Feng, Otano, Japtok, Karafilis, and Nyatetu-Waigwa&lt;/ref&gt; The genre translates fairly directly into cinematic form.

A ''Bildungsroman'' tells about the growing up or coming of age of a sensitive person who is looking for answers and experience. The genre evolved from folklore tales of a dunce or youngest son going out in the world to seek his fortune. Usually in the beginning of the story there is an emotional loss which makes the protagonist leave on his journey. In a ''Bildungsroman'', the goal is maturity, and the protagonist achieves it gradually and with difficulty. The genre often features a main conflict between the main character and society. Typically, the values of society are gradually accepted by the protagonist and he is ultimately accepted into society{{ndash}} the protagonist's mistakes and disappointments are over. In some works, the protagonist is able to reach out and help others after having achieved maturity.

==Features==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2010}}
To be categorized in the genre ''Bildungsroman'', the plot must follow a certain course. The protagonist grows from child to adult in the novel. An example of this genre could be the book [[Johnny Tremain]], or [[Tom Sawyer]]. At an early stage, a loss or some sort of discontent pushes him or her away from home or the family setting, providing an impetus to embark on a journey.  The main character often develops through &quot;self actualization&quot;. The process of maturation is long, strenuous and gradual, involving repeated clashes between the protagonist's needs and desires and the views and judgments enforced by an unbending social order.

There are many other similar genres that focus on the growth of an individual. An ''Entwicklungsroman'' (&quot;development novel&quot;) is a story of general growth rather than self-cultivation. An ''Erziehungsroman'' (&quot;education novel&quot;) focuses on training and formal schooling, while a ''[[Künstlerroman]]'' (&quot;artist novel&quot;) is about the development of an artist and shows a growth of the self.

Many genres other than the ''Bildungsroman'' can include elements of this genre as prominent parts of their story lines. For example, a military story might show a raw recruit undergoing a [[baptism by fire]] and becoming a battle-hardened [[soldier]], while a [[fantasy quest]] story may show a transformation from an [[adolescent]] [[protagonist]] into an adult who is aware of his or her [[lineage]] or powers. Yet neither of these genres or story types corresponds exactly to the ''Bildungsroman''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{about|the term for an unmarried man}}
{{Refimprove|date=November 2008}}
A '''bachelor''' is a man above the [[age of majority]] who has never been [[married]] (see [[single (relationship)]]). Unlike his female counterpart, the [[spinster]], a bachelor may have had children. The term is restricted to men who are not in a [[pair bond]] that will produce children and are not actively seeking a long-term partner.&lt;ref name=&quot;cole-note&quot;&gt;Cole, David. &quot;[http://www.d.umn.edu/~dcole/bachelor.htm Note on Analyticity and the Definability of 'Bachelor'.&quot;] Philosophy Department of the University of Minnesota Duluth. 1 February 1999. Accessed 14 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Research done by sociologists Richard Pitt and Elizabeth Borland sharpens the definition of bachelor to mean &quot;men who live independently, outside of their parents' home and other institutional settings, who are neither married nor cohabitating&quot; for just this reason. They discovered that these bachelors were more liberal in their attitudes towards women's roles in society; this was not the case for those men who were only &quot;unmarried&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accessmylibrary.com/article-1G1-180029368/bachelorhood-and-men-attitudes.html Pitt, Richard and Elizabeth Borland. 2008. &quot;Bachelorhood and Men's Attitudes about Gender Roles&quot; ''The Journal of Men's Studies'' 16:140–158]&lt;/ref&gt;

The terms ''confirmed bachelor'' or ''lifelong bachelor'' can refer to men who show little interest in marriage or other types of committed relationships, although now almost archaic due to more liberal social attitudes. These terms, as well as others such as ''not the marrying kind'' or ''never met the right woman'' are today not to be confused with gay culture, as they represent no affiliation with that lifestyle.  That said, the term ''confirmed bachelor'' was a code or euphemistic term used to describe homosexual males, especially entertainers and athletes, in the era before the sexual revolution of the 1960s, when many of their fans had no idea what homosexuality was and needed a palatable explanation for why their hero was unmarried.

&quot;Most eligible bachelor&quot; is a generic term for a published listing of bachelors considered to be desirable marriage candidates. Usually &quot;most eligible bachelor&quot; lists are published on an annual basis and present listed men in a ranked order.

==Etymology and historical meanings==&lt;!--This section is linked from [[Folk etymology]]--&gt;
The word is from [[Old French]] ''bachelier'', &quot;knight bachelor&quot;, a young [[squire]] in training, ultimately from [[Latin]] ''baccalaris'', a very low ranking [[vassal]] . The Old French term crossed into English around 1300, referring to one belonging to the lowest stage of [[knighthood]]. [[Knights bachelor]] were either poor vassals who could not afford to take the field under their own banner, or knights too young to support the responsibility and dignity of [[knights banneret]]. From the 14th century, the term was also used for a junior member of a [[guild]] (otherwise known as &quot;yeomen&quot;) or [[university]]; hence, an ecclesiastic of an inferior grade, for example, a young [[monk]] or even recently appointed [[Canon (priest)|canon]] (Severtius, de episcopis Lugdunen-sibus, p.&amp;nbsp;377, in [[Charles du Fresne, sieur du Cange|du Cange]]).

&quot;Bachelor&quot; can also refer to those holding a &quot;[[bachelor's degree]]&quot; from a [[university]] (or a four-year college, in the [[United States|American]] system of higher education). In this sense the word ''baccalarius'' or ''baccalaureus'' first appears at the [[University of Paris]] in the 13th century, in the system of degrees established under the auspices of [[Pope Gregory IX]], as applied to scholars still in ''statu pupillari''. Thus there were two classes of baccalarii: the ''baccalarii cursores'', theological candidates passed for admission to the divinity course; and the ''baccalarii dispositi'', who, having completed this course, were entitled to proceed to the higher degrees. The term ''baccalaureus'' is a [[pun]] combining the prosaic ''baccalarius'' with ''bacca lauri' &quot;[[Bay laurel|laurel]] berry&quot;—according to the American Heritage Dictionary, &quot;bacca&quot; is the Old Irish word for &quot;farmer&quot; + laureus, &quot;laurel berry,&quot; the idea being that a &quot;baccalaureate&quot; had farmed (cultivated) his mind.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

The sense of &quot;unmarried man&quot; dates to 1385. The feminine ''[[bachelorette]]'' is from 1935, replacing earlier ''bachelor-girl''. In 19th century American slang ''to bach'' was used as a verb meaning &quot;to live as an unmarried man&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

In certain [[Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf|Gulf Arab]] countries, &quot;bachelor&quot; can refer to men who are single as well as immigrant men married to a spouse residing in their country of origin (due to the high added cost of sponsoring a spouse onsite) [http://gulfnews.com/news/gulf/uae/general/hundreds-of-bachelors-crammed-in-squalid-and-dilapidated-buildings-1.194725], and a colloquial term &quot;executive bachelor&quot; is also used in rental and sharing accommodation advertisements to indicate availability to [[white-collar worker|white-collar]] bachelors in particular [http://www.google.com/search?q=executive-bachelor].

'''Background radiation''' is [[radiation]] that is constantly present in the environment and is emitted from a variety of natural and artificial sources. Primary contributions come from:
* Sources in the [[earth]]. These include sources in [[Banana equivalent dose|food]] and water, which are incorporated in the body, and in building materials and other products that incorporate those radioactive sources;
* Sources from [[outer space|space]], in the form of [[cosmic ray]]s;
* Sources in the atmosphere. One significant contribution comes from the [[radon]] gas that is released from the Earth's crust and subsequently decays into radioactive atoms that become attached to airborne dust and particulates. Another contribution arises from the radioactive atoms produced in the bombardment of atoms in the upper atmosphere by high-energy cosmic rays.

Naturally occurring sources are responsible for the vast majority of radiation exposure.  However, not including direct exposure from radiological imaging or therapy, about 3%&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rerf.or.jp/index_e.html Radiation Effects Research Foundation]{{Failed verification|need more specific URL that supports these statements|date=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=annexc&gt;{{cite book |author=[[United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation]] |chapter=Annex C: Exposures to the public from man-made sources of radiation |chapterurl=http://www.unscear.org/docs/reports/annexc.pdf |title=Sources and Effects of Ionizing Radiation |publisher=United Nations Publications |location=New York, NY |year=2000 |pages=157–291 |isbn=978-92-1-142238-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; of background radiation comes from man-made sources such as:

*[[Luminous paint#Radioluminescent paint|Self-luminous dials]] and signs
*Global [[radioactive contamination]] due to historical [[nuclear testing|nuclear weapons testing]]
*[[Nuclear power station]] or [[nuclear fuel reprocessing]] accidents
*Normal operation of facilities used for [[nuclear power]] and scientific research
*Emissions from burning [[fossil fuel]]s, such as coal fired [[fossil fuel power plant|power plants]]
*Emissions from [[nuclear medicine]] facilities and patients

== Natural background radiation ==

Natural background radiation comes from two primary sources: [[cosmic radiation]] and terrestrial sources. The worldwide average background [[absorbed dose|dose]] for a human being is about 2.4 milli[[sievert]] (mSv) per year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unscear.org/docs/reports/gareport.pdf http://www.unscear.org/docs/reports/gareport.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; This exposure is mostly from cosmic radiation and natural radionuclides in the environment (including those within the body). This is far greater than human-caused background radiation exposure, which in the year 2000 amounted to an average of about 5 μSv per year from historical nuclear weapons testing, nuclear power accidents and nuclear industry operation combined,&lt;ref name = &quot;rrjhjx&quot;&gt;[http://www.unscear.org/unscear/en/publications.html United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation]{{fv|need a more specific citation that supports this statement|date=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is greater than the average exposure from medical tests, which ranges from 0.04 to 1 mSv per year. Older coal-fired power plants without effective fly ash capture are one of the largest sources of human-caused background radiation exposure.

The level of natural background radiation varies depending on location, and in some areas the level is significantly higher than average.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taishitsu.or.jp/radiation/index-e.html Annual terrestrial radiation doses in the world]&lt;/ref&gt; Such areas include [[Ramsar, Mazandaran|Ramsar]] in Iran, [[Guarapari]] in Brazil, [[Kerala]] in India,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=10564957 |year=1999 |last1=Nair |first1=MK |last2=Nambi |first2=KS |last3=Amma |first3=NS |last4=Gangadharan |first4=P |last5=Jayalekshmi |first5=P |last6=Jayadevan |first6=S |last7=Cherian |first7=V |last8=Reghuram |first8=KN |title=Population study in the high natural background radiation area in Kerala, India |volume=152 |issue=6 Suppl |pages=S145–8 |journal=Radiation research |doi=10.2307/3580134}}&lt;/ref&gt; the northern [[Flinders Ranges]] in Australia&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/catalyst/stories/s692473.htm Extreme Slime]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Yangjiang]] in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Hiroshige |last1=Morishima |first2=Taeko |last2=Koga |first3=Kusuo |last3=Tatsumi |first4=Sayaka |last4=Nakai |first5=Tsutomu |last5=Sugahara |first6=Yongling |last6=Yuan |first7=Luxin |last7=Wei |year=2000 |title=Dose Measurement, Its Distribution and Individual External Dose Assessments of Inhabitants in the High Background Radiation Areas in China |journal=Journal of Radiation Research |volume=41 |issue=Suppl |pages=9–23 |url=http://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jrr/41/SUPPL/S9/_pdf/-char/ja/ |doi=10.1269/jrr.41.S9 |pmid=11142215}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Ramsar a peak yearly dose of 260 mSv has been reported (compared with  0.06 mSv of a [[chest radiograph]] or up to 20 mSv of a [[X-ray_computed_tomography#Typical_scan_doses|CT scan]]).&lt;ref name=Dissanayake2005&gt;{{cite journal |pages=883–5 |doi=10.1126/science.1115174 |title=GLOBAL VOICES OF SCIENCE: Of Stones and Health: Medical Geology in Sri Lanka |year=2005 |last1=Dissanayake |first1=C. |journal=Science |volume=309 |issue=5736 |pmid=16081722}}&lt;/ref&gt; The highest levels of natural background radiation recorded in the world is from areas around [[Ramsar, Mazandaran|Ramsar]], particularly at Talesh-Mahalleh which is a very high background radiation area (VHBRA) having an effective dose equivalent several times in excess of [[ICRP]]-recommended radiation dose limits for radiation workers and up to 200 times greater than normal background levels. Most of the radiation in the area is due to dissolved [[radium]]-226 in water of hot springs along with smaller amounts of [[uranium]] and [[thorium]] due to travertine deposits. There are more than nine hot springs in the area with different concentrations of radioisotopes, and these are used as spas by locals and tourists.&lt;ref name=pmid11769138&gt;{{cite journal |pages=87–93 |url=http://www.probeinternational.org/Ramsar.pdf |doi=10.1097/00004032-200201000-00011 |title=Very high background radiation areas of Ramsar, Iran: preliminary biological studies |year=2002 |last1=Ghiassi-Nejad |first1=M. |last2=Mortazavi |first2=S.

It has also been reported that residents have  healthier and longer lives.&lt;ref name=Dissanayake2005/&gt; On the basis of this and other evidences including the fact that life had originated in a much more irradiated environment, some scientists have questioned the validity of [[linear no-threshold model]], on which all radiation regulations currently depend.&lt;ref name=pmid11769138/&gt; Others point out that some level of radiation might actually be good for health and have a positive effect on population based on the controversial [[radiation hormesis]] model, by jump starting [[DNA repair]] mechanisms inside the cell.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.environmentalgraffiti.com/ecology/positive-effects-of-nuclear-radiation/1066&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=334–43 |doi=10.1897/03-163R.1 |laysummary=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2005/01/050128222047.htm |laysource=[[ScienceDaily]] |laydate=January 29, 2005 |title=Hormetic effects of gamma radiation on the stress axis of natural populations of meadow voles (Microtus pennsylvanicus) |year=2005 |last1=Boonstra |first1=Rudy |last2=Manzon |first2=Richard G. |last3=Mihok |first3=Steve |last4=Helson |first4=Julie E. |journal=Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry |volume=24 |issue=2 |pmid=15719993}}&lt;/ref&gt; Background radiation doses in the immediate vicinities of particles of high atomic number materials, within the human body, have a small enhancement due to the photoelectric effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=603–11 |doi=10.1098/rsif.2009.0300 |title=Enhancement of natural background gamma-radiation dose around uranium microparticles in the human body |year=2009 |last1=Pattison |first1=J.

===Cosmic radiation===
{{main|Cosmic ray}}
The Earth, and all living things on it, are constantly bombarded by radiation from outer space. This radiation primarily consists of positively charged ions from [[proton]]s to [[iron]] and larger [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]] derived sources outside our [[solar system]]. This radiation interacts with atoms in the atmosphere to create secondary radiation, including [[X-ray]]s, [[muon]]s, [[proton]]s, [[alpha particle]]s, [[pion]]s, [[electron]]s, and [[neutron]]s. The immediate dose from cosmic radiation is largely from muons, neutrons, and electrons, and this dose varies in different parts of the world based largely on the [[geomagnetic field]] and altitude. This radiation is much more intense in the upper [[troposphere]], around 10&amp;nbsp;km altitude, and is thus of particular concern for [[airline]] crews and frequent passengers, who spend many hours per year in this environment. During their flights airline crews typically get an extra dose on the order of 2.2mSv (220 mrem) per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Radiation Exposure During Commercial Airline Flights|accessdate=2011-03-17|url=http://www.hps.org/publicinformation/ate/faqs/commercialflights.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, cosmic rays cause higher background exposure in [[astronaut]]s than in humans on the surface of Earth. Astronauts in low [[orbit]]s, such as in the [[International Space Station]] or the [[Space Shuttle]], are partially shielded by the [[magnetic field]] of the Earth, but also suffer from the [[Van Allen radiation belt]] which accumulates cosmic rays and results from the earths magnetic field. Outside low Earth orbit, as experienced by the [[Apollo program|Apollo]] astronauts who traveled to the [[Moon]], this background radiation is much more intense, and represents a considerable obstacle to potential future long term human exploration of the [[Manned mission to the moon|moon]] or [[Manned mission to Mars|Mars]].

Cosmic rays also cause [[Nuclear transmutation|elemental transmutation]] in the atmosphere, in which secondary radiation generated by the cosmic rays combines with [[atomic nuclei]] in the atmosphere to generate different  [[nuclides]]. Many so-called [[cosmogenic nuclides]] can be produced, but probably the most notable is [[carbon-14]], which is produced by interactions with [[nitrogen]] atoms. These cosmogenic nuclides eventually reach the Earth's surface and can be incorporated into living organisms. The production of these nuclides varies slightly with short-term variations in solar cosmic ray flux, but is considered practically constant over long scales of thousands to millions of years. The constant production, incorporation into organisms and relatively short [[half-life]] of carbon-14 are the principles used in [[radiocarbon dating]] of ancient biological materials such as wooden artifacts or human remains.

===Terrestrial sources===

Radioactive material is found throughout nature. It occurs naturally in the [[soil]], rocks, water, air, and vegetation. The major [[radionuclide]]s of concern for '''terrestrial radiation''' are common elements with low-abundance radioactive isotopes, like [[potassium]] and [[carbon]], or the long-lived elements [[uranium]] and [[thorium]] and their decay products, some of which, like [[radium]] and [[radon]] are intensely radioactive but occur in low concentrations. Most of these sources have been decreasing, due to [[radioactive decay]] since the formation of the Earth, because there is no significant amount currently transported to the Earth. Thus, the present activity on earth from [[uranium-238]] is only half as much as it originally was because of its 4.5 [[1000000000 (number)|billion]] year half-life, and [[potassium]]-40 (half life 1.25 billion years) is only at about 8% of original activity. The effects on humans of the actual diminishment (due to decay) of these isotopes is minimal however. This is because humans evolved too recently for the difference in activity over a fraction of a half-life to be significant. Put another way, human history is so short in comparison to a half life of a billion years, that the activity of these long-lived isotopes has been effectively constant throughout our time on this planet.

In addition, many shorter half-life and thus more intensely radioactive isotopes have not decayed out of the terrestrial environment, however, because of natural on-going production of them. Examples of these are carbon-14 (cosmogenic), [[radium]]-226 (decay product of uranium-238) and radon-222 (a decay product of [[radium]]-226).

====Radiation inside the human body====

Some of the essential elements that make up the human body, mainly potassium and carbon, have radioactive isotopes that add significantly to our background radiation dose.  An average human contains about 30 milligrams of [[potassium-40]] (&lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;K) and about 10 nanograms (10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;g) of [[carbon-14]] (&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C), which has a decay half-life of 5,730±40 years.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} Excluding internal contamination by external radioactive material, the largest component of internal radiation exposure from biologically functional components of the human body is from potassium-40. The decay of about 4,000 nuclei of &lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;K per second&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~scdiroff/lds/QuantumRelativity/RadioactiveHumanBody/RadioactiveHumanBody.html Radioactive human body — Harvard University Natural Science Lecture Demonstrations]{{Self-published inline|date=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; makes potassium the largest source of radiation in terms of number of decaying atoms. The energy of [[beta particle]]s produced by &lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;K is also about 10 times more powerful than the beta particles from &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C decay.
&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C is present in the human body at a level of 3700 Bq with a [[Biological half-life|biological half-life]] of 40 days.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ead.anl.gov/pub/doc/carbon14.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; There are about 1,200 beta particles per second produced by the decay of &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C. However, a &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C atom is in the genetic information of about half the cells, while potassium is not a component of [[DNA]]. The decay of a &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C atom inside  DNA in one person happens about 50 times per second, changing a carbon atom to one of [[nitrogen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |authorlink=Isaac Asimov |title=Only A Trillion |origyear=1957 |edition=Revised and updated |year=1976 |publisher=ACE books |location=New York |pages=37–39 |chapter=The Explosions Within Us |isbn=1157094686 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Radon====

[[Radon]] is a terrestrial source of ionizing radiation that is of particular concern because, although on average it is very rare, this intensely radioactive element can be found in high concentrations in many areas of the world, where it represents a significant health hazard. Radon is a decay product of uranium, which is relatively common in the Earth's crust, but generally concentrated in ore-bearing rocks scattered around the world. Radon seeps out of these ores into the atmosphere or into ground water, and in these localities it can accumulate within dwellings and expose humans to high concentrations. The widespread construction of well insulated and sealed homes in the northern industrialized world has led to radon becoming the primary source of background radiation in some localities in northern North America and Europe. Some of these areas, including [[Cornwall]] and [[Aberdeenshire]] in the [[United Kingdom]] have high enough natural radiation levels that [[nuclear licensed site]]s cannot be built there — the sites would already exceed legal radiation limits before they opened, and the natural topsoil and rock would all have to be disposed of as [[low-level nuclear waste]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

Radiation exposure from radon is indirect. Radon has a short half-life (4 days) and decays into other solid particulate [[Decay chain#Radium series|radium-series]] radioactive nuclides. These radioactive particles are inhaled and remain lodged in the lungs, causing continued exposure. People in affected localities can receive up to 10 mSv per year background radiation.&lt;ref name = &quot;rrjhjx&quot;/&gt; Radon is thus the second leading cause of [[lung cancer]] after [[tobacco smoking|smoking]], and accounts for 15,000 to 22,000 cancer deaths per year in the US alone.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Risk/radon Radon and Cancer: Questions and Answers - National Cancer Institute (USA)]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Human-caused background radiation ==

Frequent above-ground nuclear explosions between the 1940s and 1960s scattered a substantial amount of [[radioactive contamination]]. Some of this contamination is local, rendering the immediate surroundings highly radioactive, while some of it is carried longer distances as [[nuclear fallout]]; some of this material is dispersed worldwide. The increase in background radiation due to these tests peaked in 1963 at about 0.15 mSv per year worldwide, or about 7% of average background dose from all sources. The [[Limited Test Ban Treaty]] of 1963 prohibited above-ground tests, thus by the year 2000 the worldwide dose from these historical tests has decreased to only 0.005 mSv per year.&lt;ref name = &quot;rrjhjx&quot;/&gt;

Older coal-fired power plants without effective [[fly ash]] capture are one of the largest sources of human-caused background radiation exposure. When coal is burned, uranium, thorium and all the uranium daughters accumulated by disintegration — radium, radon, polonium — are released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Alex |last1=Gabbard |year=1993 |title=Coal Combustion: Nuclear Resource or Danger? |journal=Oak Ridge National Laboratory Review |volume=26 |issue=3–4 |pages=18–9 |url=http://www.ornl.gov/info/ornlreview/rev26-34/text/colmain.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 1978 article in Science magazine, &quot;coal-fired power plants throughout the world are the major sources of radioactive materials released to the environment&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=1045–50 |doi=10.1126/science.202.4372.1045 |title=Radiological Impact of Airborne Effluents of Coal and Nuclear Plants |year=1978 |last1=McBride |first1=J. P. |last2=Moore |first2=R. E. |last3=Witherspoon |first3=J. P. |last4=Blanco |first4=R. E. |journal=Science |volume=202 |issue=4372 |pmid=17777943|bibcode = 1978Sci...202.1045M }}&lt;/ref&gt; Radioactive materials previously buried underground in coal deposits are released as fly ash or, if fly ash is captured, may be incorporated into concrete manufactured with fly ash. Radioactive materials are also released in gaseous emissions. The United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation estimates that per gigawatt-year (GW&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;a) of electrical energy produced by coal, using the current mix of technology throughout the world, the population impact is approximately 0.8 lethal cancers per plant-year distributed over the affected population. With 400 GW of coal-fired power plants in the world, this amounts to some 320 deaths per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Garwin |first=Richard L.|title=Megawatts and Megatons: The Future of Nuclear Power and Nuclear Weapons |page=233 |editor=[[Richard Garwin]] and [[Georges Charpak]] |isbn=0-226-28427-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nuclear reactors may also release a certain amount of radioactive contamination. Under normal circumstances, a modern nuclear reactor releases minuscule amounts of radioactive contamination. Major accidents, which have been rare, have also released some radioactive contamination into the environment; this was the case with the [[Windscale fire]] ([[Sellafield]] accident), the [[Chernobyl accident]], and the [[Fukushima I nuclear accidents]].

The amount of radioactive contamination released by human activity is rather small and in most cases negligible in comparison to natural background radiation.&lt;ref name=annexb&gt;{{cite book |author=[[United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation]] |chapter=Annex B: Exposures from natural radiation sources |chapterurl=http://www.unscear.org/docs/reports/annexb.pdf |title=Sources and Effects of Ionizing Radiation |publisher=United Nations Publications |location=New York, NY |year=2000 |pages=83–156 |isbn=978-92-1-142238-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Artificial radiation sources ==

The radiation from natural and artificial radiation sources are identical in their nature and their effects. These materials are distributed in the environment, and in our bodies, according to the chemical properties of the elements. The [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]], the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]], and other U.S. and international agencies, require that licensees limit radiation exposure to individual members of the public to 1 [[sievert|mSv]] (100 m[[roentgen equivalent man|rem]]) per year, and limit occupational radiation exposure to adults working with radioactive material to 50 mSv (5 rem) per year, and 100 mSv (10 rem) in 5 years.

The exposure for an average person is about 3.6 mSv/year{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}, 80 percent of which comes from natural sources of radiation. The remaining 20 percent results from exposure to artificial radiation sources, such as medical [[x-ray]]s, industrial sources like smoke detectors and a small fraction from [[nuclear weapon]]s tests.

==Other usage==

In other contexts, '''background radiation''' may simply be any radiation that is pervasive, whether ionizing or not. A particular example of this is the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]], a nearly uniform glow that fills the sky in the microwave part of the spectrum; stars, galaxies and other objects of interest in [[radio astronomy]] stand out against this background.

In a laboratory, '''background radiation''' refers to the measured value from any sources that affect an instrument when a radiation source sample is not being measured. This background rate, which must be established as a stable value by multiple measurements, usually before and after sample measurement, is subtracted from the rate measured when the sample is being measured.

'''Background radiation''' for occupational doses measured for workers is all radiation dose that is not measured by radiation dose measurement instruments in potential occupational exposure conditions. This includes both &quot;natural background radiation&quot; and any medical radiation doses. This value is not typically measured or known from surveys, such that variations in the total dose to individual workers is not known. This can be a significant confounding factor in assessing radiation exposure effects in a population of workers who may have significantly different natural background and medical radiation doses. This is most significant when the occupational doses are very low.

{{good article}}
[[Image:Banquo.jpg|alt=Painting showing Elizabethan era men at a dining table, with a ghost sitting on one of the stools.|thumb|right|300px|[[Théodore Chassériau]] (1819–1856), ''The Ghost of Banquo'' 1855]]
'''Banquo''' is a character in [[William Shakespeare]]'s 1606 play ''[[Macbeth]]''. In the play, he is at first an ally to [[Macbeth (character)|Macbeth]] (both are captains in the King's army) and they are together when they meet the [[Three Witches]]. After prophesying that Macbeth will become king, the witches tell Banquo that he will not be king himself, but that his descendants will be. Later, Macbeth in his lust for power sees Banquo as a threat  and has him murdered; Banquo's son, [[Fleance]], escapes. Banquo's ghost returns in a later scene, causing Macbeth to react with alarm during a public feast.

Shakespeare borrowed the character of Banquo from ''Holinshed's Chronicles'', a history of Britain published by [[Raphael Holinshed]] in 1587. In ''Chronicles'' Banquo is an accomplice to Macbeth in the murder of the king, rather than a loyal subject of the king who is seen as an enemy by Macbeth. Shakespeare may have changed this aspect of his character in order to please [[James I of England|King James I]], who was thought at the time to be a descendant of the real Banquo. Critics often interpret Banquo's role in the play as being a [[Foil (literature)|foil]] to Macbeth, resisting evil where Macbeth embraces it. Sometimes, however, his motives are unclear, and some critics question his purity. He does nothing to accuse Macbeth of murdering the king, even though he has reason to believe Macbeth is responsible. 

Banquo has been played by a variety of actors on the stage and in film, including [[Canada Lee]], [[Minoru Chiaki]], and [[Martin Shaw]].

Shakespeare often used [[Raphael Holinshed|Raphael Holinshed's]] ''Chronicles of England, Scotland, and Ireland''—commonly known as ''[[Holinshed's Chronicles]]''—as a source for his plays, and in ''[[Macbeth]]'' he borrows from several of the tales in that work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Coursen |first=Herbert |title=Macbeth |publisher=Greenwood Press |location=Westport |year=1997 |isbn=031330047X |pages=15–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Holinshed portrays Banquo as an historical figure: he is an accomplice in [[Macbeth of Scotland|Mac Bethad mac Findlaích's]] (Macbeth's) murder of [[Duncan I of Scotland|Donnchad mac Crínáin]] (King Duncan) and plays an important part in ensuring that Macbeth, not [[Malcolm III of Scotland|Máel Coluim mac Donnchada]] (Malcolm), takes the throne in the coup that follows.&lt;ref name=&quot;note&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Nagarajan |first=S. |title=A Note on Banquo |journal=[[Shakespeare Quarterly]] |month=October |year=1956 |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=371–6 |publisher=[[Folger Shakespeare Library]] |doi=10.2307/2866356}}&lt;/ref&gt; Holinshed in turn used an earlier work, the ''Scotorum Historiae'' (1526–7) by [[Hector Boece]], as his source. Boece's work is the first known record of Banquo and his son [[Fleance]]; and scholars such as [[David Bevington]] generally consider them fictional characters invented by Boece. In Shakespeare's day, however, they were considered historical figures of great repute, and the king, [[James I of England|James I]], based his claim to the throne in part on a descent from Banquo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Four Tragedies |last=Bevington |first=David |publisher=Bantam |year=1988 |isbn=0553212834 |page=714}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[House of Stuart]] was descended from [[Walter fitz Alan]], the first [[High Steward of Scotland]], and he was believed to be the son of Fleance and [[Gruffydd ap Llywelyn|Gruffydd ap Llywelyn's]] daughter, [[Nesta verch Gruffydd]]. In reality Walter fitz Alan was the son of a [[Breton]] knight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Palmer |first=J. Foster |title=The Celt in Power: Tudor and Cromwell |journal=Transactions of the Royal Historical Society |year=1886 |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=343–70 |doi=10.2307/3677851 |publisher=[[Royal Historical Society]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike his sources, Shakespeare gives Banquo no role in the King's murder, making it a deed committed solely by Macbeth and his wife. Why Shakespeare's Banquo is so different from the character described by Holinshed and Boece is not known, though critics have proposed several possible explanations. First among them is the risk associated with portraying the king's ancestor as a murderer and conspirator in the plot to overthrow a rightful king, as well as the author's desire to flatter a powerful patron. But Shakespeare may also simply have altered Banquo's character because there was no dramatic need for another accomplice to the murder. There was, however, a need to provide a dramatic contrast to Macbeth; a role that many scholars argue is filled by Banquo.&lt;ref name=&quot;note&quot;/&gt; Similarly, when [[Jean de Schelandre]] wrote about Banquo in his ''[[Stuartide]]'' in 1611, he also changed the character by portraying him as a noble and honourable man—the critic D. W. Maskell describes him as “…Schelandre's paragon of valour and virtue”—probably for reasons similar to Shakespeare's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Transformation of History into Epic: The &quot;Stuartide&quot; (1611) of Jean de Schelandre |last=Maskell |first=D. W. |journal=[[The Modern Language Review]] |month= January |year=1971 |volume=66 |issue=1 |pages=53–65 |doi=10.2307/3722467 |publisher=[[Modern Humanities Research Association]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Banquo's role in the coup that follows the murder is harder to explain. Banquo's loyalty to Macbeth, rather than Malcolm, after Duncan's death makes him a passive accomplice in the coup: Malcolm, as Prince of Cumberland, is the rightful heir to the throne and Macbeth a usurper. Daniel Amneus, however, argues that when Ross and Angus bring King Duncan's praise, and the news that Macbeth has been granted the title of Thane of Cawdor, the &quot;greater honor&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shakespeare-navigators.com/macbeth/T13.html#104 ''Macbeth'', Act 1, Scene 3, line 104.]&lt;/ref&gt; he ascribes to Macbeth is actually his title as Prince of Cumberland. If Macbeth, rather than Malcolm, is Prince of Cumberland then Macbeth would be next in line to the throne and no coup would be needed, effectively removing this ambiguity from Banquo's character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Amneus |first=Daniel |chapter=Macbeth's “Greater Honor” |editor1-last=Barroll |editor1-first=J. Leeds |title=Shakespeare Studies |location=New York |publisher=Burt Franklin |year=1978 |isbn=0891020845 |pages=223–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role in the play==
[[Image:Macbeth and Banquo with the witches JHF.jpg|alt=Dark painting showing two figures encountering witch-like creatures.|thumb|upright|''Macbeth and Banquo with the Witches'' by [[Henry Fuseli]]]]
Banquo is in a third of the play's scenes, as both a human and a ghost. As significant as he is to the plot, he has fewer lines than the relatively insignificant Ross, a Scottish nobleman who survives the play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Braunmuller |first=A. R. |chapter=Introduction |title=Macbeth |editor1-first=A. R. |editor1-last=Braunmuller |series=The New Cambridge Shakespeare |location=Cambridge |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |year=1997 |isbn=052129455X |page=266}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the second scene of the play, King Duncan describes the brave manner in which Macbeth, Thane of Glamis, and Banquo bravely led his army against invaders, fighting side by side. In the next scene, Banquo and Macbeth, returning from the battle together, encounter the [[Three Witches]], who predict that Macbeth will become Thane of Cawdor, and then king. Banquo, skeptical of the witches, challenges them to predict his own future, and they foretell that Banquo will never himself take the throne, but will beget a line of kings. Banquo remains skeptical after the encounter, wondering aloud if evil can ever speak the truth. He warns Macbeth that evil will offer men a small, hopeful truth only in order to catch them in a deadly trap.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shakespeare-navigators.com/macbeth/T13.html ''Macbeth.'' Act 1, Scene 3.]&lt;/ref&gt;

When Macbeth kills the king and takes the throne, Banquo—the only one aware of this encounter with the witches—reserves judgment for God. He is unsure whether Macbeth committed regicide to gain the throne, but muses in a [[soliloquy]] that &quot;I fear / Thou play'dst most foully for 't&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shakespeare-navigators.com/macbeth/T31.html#2 ''Macbeth'', Act 3, Scene 1, lines 2–3.]&lt;/ref&gt;  He offers his respects to the new King Macbeth and pledges loyalty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shakespeare-navigators.com/macbeth/T31.html ''Macbeth.'' Act 3, Scene 1.]&lt;/ref&gt; Later, worried that Banquo's descendants and not his own will rule [[Scotland]], Macbeth sends men to kill Banquo and his son [[Fleance]]. During the melee, Banquo holds off the assailants so that Fleance can escape, but is himself killed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shakespeare-navigators.com/macbeth/T33.html ''Macbeth.'' Act 3, Scene 3.]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ghosts in European culture|ghost]] of Banquo later returns to haunt Macbeth at the banquet in act three, scene four. A terrified Macbeth sees him, while the apparition is invisible to his guests. He appears again to Macbeth in a vision granted by the Three Witches, wherein Macbeth sees a long line of kings descended from Banquo.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shakespeare-navigators.com/macbeth/T41.html ''Macbeth.'' Act 4, Scene 1.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis==
===Foil to Macbeth===
[[File:Macbeth and Banquo Meeting the Weird Sisters JW-detail.jpg|alt=Painting showing men meeting three figures emerging from a cave.|thumb|''Macbeth and Banquo Meeting the Three Witches'' by [[John Wootton]]]]
Many scholars see Banquo as a [[foil (literature)|foil]] and a contrast to Macbeth. Macbeth, for example, eagerly accepts the Three Witches' prophecy as true and seeks to help it along. Banquo, on the other hand, doubts the prophecies and the intentions of these seemingly evil creatures. Whereas Macbeth places his hope in the prediction that he will be king, Banquo argues that evil only offers gifts that lead to destruction. Banquo steadily resists the temptations of evil within the play, praying to heaven for help, while Macbeth seeks darkness, and prays that evil powers will aid him. This is visible in act two; after Banquo sees Duncan to bed, he says: &quot;There's husbandry in heaven, / Their candles are all out&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;shakespeare-navigators.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.shakespeare-navigators.com/macbeth/T21.html#4 ''Macbeth'', Act 2, Scene 1, lines 4–5.]&lt;/ref&gt; This premonition of the coming darkness in association with Macbeth's murders is repeated just before Banquo is killed: &quot;it will be rain to-night&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shakespeare-navigators.com/macbeth/T33.html#16 ''Macbeth'', Act 3, Scene 3, line 16.]&lt;/ref&gt; Banquo tells his son Fleance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Watson |first=Robert N. |chapter=“Thriftless Ambition,” Foolish Wishes, and the Tragedy of Macbeth |title=William Shakespeare's Macbeth |editor1-first=Harold |editor1-last=Bloom |series=Modern Critical Interpretations |location=New York |publisher=Chelsea House Publishers |year=1987 |isbn=0877549303 |pages=133–68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Banquo's status as a contrast to Macbeth makes for some tense moments in the play. In act two, scene one, Banquo meets his son Fleance and asks him to take both his sword and his dagger (&quot;Hold, take my sword&amp;nbsp;... Take thee that too&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;shakespeare-navigators.com&quot;/&gt;). He also explains that he has been having trouble sleeping due to &quot;cursed thoughts that nature / gives way to in repose!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shakespeare-navigators.com/macbeth/T21.html#8 ''Macbeth'', Act 2, Scene 1, lines 8–9.]&lt;/ref&gt; On Macbeth's approach, he demands the sword returned to him quickly. Scholars have interpreted this to mean that Banquo has been dreaming of murdering the king as Macbeth's accomplice in order to take the throne for his own family, as the Three Witches prophesied to him. In this reading, his good nature is so revolted by these thoughts that he gives his sword and dagger to Fleance to be sure they do not come true, but is so nervous at Macbeth's approach that he demands them back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= A Note on &quot;Macbeth,&quot; Act II, Scene 1 |last=Westbrook |first=Perry D. |journal=[[College English]] |month=January |year=1946 |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=219–20 |doi=10.2307/371197 |publisher=[[National Council of Teachers of English]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars have responded that Banquo's dreams have less to do with killing the king and more to do with Macbeth. They argue that Banquo is merely setting aside his sword for the night. Then, when Macbeth approaches, Banquo, having had dreams about Macbeth's deeds, takes back his sword as a precaution in this case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Banquo, Loyal Subject |last=Henneberger |first=Olive |journal=College English |month=October |year=1946 |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=18–22 |doi=10.2307/370443 |publisher=National Council of Teachers of English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Macbeth eventually sees that Banquo can no longer be trusted to aid him in his evil, and considers his friend a threat to his newly acquired throne. Thus he has him murdered.&lt;ref name=&quot;note&quot;/&gt; Banquo's ability to live on in different ways is another oppositional force, in this case to Macbeth's impending death. His spirit lives on in Fleance, his son, and in his ghostly presence at the banquet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Calderwood |first=James L. |title=If It Were Done: Macbeth and Tragic Action |location=Amherst |publisher=[[University of Massachusetts Press]] |year=1986 |pages=96–7 |isbn=9780870235344}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ghost scenes===
When Macbeth returns to the witches later in the play, they show him an apparation of the murdered Banquo, along with eight of his descendants. The scene carries deep significance: King James, on the throne when ''Macbeth'' was written, was believed to be separated from Banquo by nine generations. What Shakespeare writes here thus amounts to a strong support of James' right to the throne by lineage, and for audiences of Shakespeare's day, a very real fulfillment of the witches' prophecy to Banquo that his sons would take the throne.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=&quot;Macbeth&quot;: King James's Play |last=Williams |first=George Walton |journal=[[South Atlantic Review]] |month=May |year=1982 |volume=47 |issue=2 |pages=12–21 |doi=10.2307/3199207}}&lt;/ref&gt; This apparition is also deeply unsettling to Macbeth, who not only wants the throne for himself, but also desires to father a line of kings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Apparitions in Macbeth, Part II |last=Crawford |first=A. W. |journal=[[Modern Language Notes]] |month=November |year=1924 |volume=39 |issue=7 |pages=383–8 |publisher=[[The Johns Hopkins University Press]] |doi=10.2307/2914760}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Banquo's other appearance as a ghost during the banquet scene serves as an indicator of Macbeth's conscience returning to plague his thoughts. Banquo's triumph over death appears symbolically, insofar as he literally takes Macbeth's seat during the feast. Shocked, Macbeth uses words appropriate to the metaphor of usurpation, describing Banquo as &quot;crowned&quot; with wounds. The spirit drains Macbeth's manhood along with the blood from his cheeks; as soon as Banquos form vanishes, Macbeth announces: &quot;Why, so; being gone, / I am a man again.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clicknotes.com/macbeth/T34.html#106 ''Macbeth'', Act 3, Scene 4, lines 106–107.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Calder&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Calderwood |first=James L. |title=If It Were Done: Macbeth and Tragic Action |location=Amherst |publisher=[[University of Massachusetts Press]] |year=1986 |pages=126–9 |isbn=9780870235344}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like the vision of Banquo's lineage, the banquet scene has also been the subject of criticism. Critics have questioned whether not one, but perhaps two ghosts appear in this scene: Banquo and Duncan. Scholars arguing that Duncan attends the banquet state that Macbeth's lines to the Ghost could apply equally well to the slain king. &quot;Thou canst not say I did it&quot;, for example, can mean that Macbeth is not the man who actually killed Banquo, or it can mean that Duncan, who was asleep when Macbeth killed him, cannot claim to have seen his killer. To add to the confusion, some lines Macbeth directs to the ghost, such as &quot;Thy bones are marrowless&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clicknotes.com/macbeth/T34.html#94 ''Macbeth'', Act 3, Scene 4, line 91.]&lt;/ref&gt; cannot rightly be said of Banquo, who has only recently died.&lt;ref name=&quot;Furness&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Macbeth |editor1-last=Furness |editor1-first=Horace Howard |editor1-link=Horace Howard Furness |publisher=Classic Books |year=2007 |isbn=0742652831 |pages=167–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars  debate whether Macbeth's vision of Banquo is real or a hallucination. Macbeth had already seen a hallucination before killing Duncan: a knife hovering in the air. Several performances of the play have even ignored the stage direction to have the Ghost of Banquo enter at all, heightening the sense that Macbeth is growing mad, since the audience cannot see what he claims to see. Scholars opposing this view claim that while the dagger is unusual, ghosts of murdered victims are more believable, having a basis in the audience's superstitions. Spirits in other Shakespeare plays—notably ''[[Hamlet]]'' and ''[[Midsummer Night's Dream]]''—exist in ambiguous forms, occasionally even calling into question their own presence.&lt;ref name=&quot;Calder&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Furness&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bradley |first=A. C. |authorlink=A. C. Bradley |title=Shakespearean Tragedy |location=Boston |publisher=Adamant Media |year=2003 |isbn=1421208490 |pages=492–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Performances and interpretations==
Banquo's role, especially in the banquet ghost scene, has been subject to a variety of interpretations and mediums. Shakespeare's text states: &quot;Enter Ghost of Banquo, and sits in Macbeth's place.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shakespeare-navigators.com/macbeth/T34.html#36 ''Macbeth'', Act 3, Scene 4.]&lt;/ref&gt; Several television versions have altered this slightly, having Banquo appear suddenly in the chair, rather than walking onstage and into it. Special effects and camera tricks also allow producers to make the ghost disappear and reappear, highlighting the fact that ''only'' Macbeth can see it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Imperial Theme: &quot;Macbeth&quot; on Television |last=Jones |first=Claude E.  |journal=The Quarterly of Film Radio and Television |month=April |year=1955 |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=292–8 |publisher=[[University of California Press]] |doi=10.1525/fq.1955.9.3.04a00070}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stage directors, unaided by post-production effects and camera tricks, have used other methods to depict the ghost. In the late 19th century, elaborate productions of the play staged by [[Henry Irving]] employed a wide variety of approaches for this task. In 1877 a green silhouette was used to create a ghostlike image; ten years later a trick chair was used to allow an actor to appear in the middle of the scene, and then again from the midst of the audience. In 1895 a shaft of blue light served to indicate the presence of Banquo's spirit. In 1933 a Russian director named Theodore Komisarjevsky staged a modern retelling of the play (Banquo and Macbeth were told of their future through [[palmistry]]); he used Macbeth's shadow as the ghost.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barnet&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Barnet |first=Sylvan |chapter=''Macbeth'' on Stage and Screen |title=Macbeth |editor1-first=Sylvan |editor1-last=Barnet |location=London |publisher=Penguin Books |year=1963 |isbn=0451524446 |pages=186–200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Film adaptations have approached Banquo's character in a variety of ways. In 1936 [[Orson Welles]] helped produce an [[African-American]] cast of the play, including [[Canada Lee]] in the role of Banquo.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barnet&quot;/&gt; [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s 1957 adaptation ''[[Throne of Blood]]'' makes the character into Capitan Miki, slain by Macbeth's equivalent (Captain Washizu) when his wife explains that she is with child. News of Miki's death does not reach Washizu until after he has seen the ghost in the banquet scene. In [[Roman Polanski]]'s 1971 [[Macbeth (1971 film)|adaptation]], Banquo is played by acclaimed stage actor [[Martin Shaw]], in a style reminiscent of earlier stage performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Braunmuller |first=A.

The '''British Army''' is the [[Army|land warfare]] branch of [[British Armed Forces|Her Majesty's Armed Forces]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. It came into being with the unification of the Kingdoms of England and [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]] into the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] in 1707. The new British Army incorporated Regiments that had already existed in England and Scotland and was administered by the [[War Office]] from [[London]]. It has been managed by the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] since 1963.

As of February 2011 the British Army employs 106,550 Regulars, 3,880 [[Brigade of Gurkhas|Gurkhas]]&lt;ref name=mod/&gt; and 33,130 Territorials for a total combined component strength of 143,560 Soldiers. In addition there are 134,190 Regular Reserves of the British Army. The full-time element of the British Army has also been referred to as the ''Regular Army'' since the creation of the reservist ''[[Territorial Force]]'' in 1908. The British Army is deployed in many of the world's war zones as part of both [[Expeditionary warfare|Expeditionary Forces]] and in [[United Nations]] [[Peacekeeping]] forces. The British Army is currently deployed in [[Kosovo Force#Contributing nations|Kosovo]], [[British Forces Cyprus|Cyprus]], [[British Forces Germany|Germany]], [[International Security Assistance Force#NATO nations|Afghanistan]] and many other places.

All members of the Army swear (or affirm) allegiance to the monarch as commander-in-chief. However the [[Bill of Rights 1689|Bill of Rights of 1689]] requires Parliamentary consent for the Crown to maintain a standing army in peacetime. Parliament therefore annually approves the continued existence of the Army.

In contrast to the [[Royal Navy]], [[Royal Marines]] and [[Royal Air Force]], the British Army does not include ''Royal'' in its title. Many of the Army's constituent Regiments and Corps have been granted the &quot;Royal&quot; prefix and have members of the [[British Royal Family|Royal Family]] occupying senior positions within some regiments.

The professional head of the British Army is the [[Chief of the General Staff (United Kingdom)|Chief of the General Staff]], currently [[Peter Wall (British Army officer)|General Sir Peter Wall KCB CBE ADC Gen.]]

The British Army came into being with the merger of the [[Scottish Army]] and the [[English Army]], following the unification of the [[Kingdom of England]] and the [[Kingdom of Scotland]], as the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] in 1707. The new British Army incorporated existing English and Scottish regiments, and was controlled from [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ltscotland.org.uk/scotlandshistory/unioncrownsparliaments/unionofparliaments/index.asp The Union of the Parliaments 1707] [[Learning and Teaching Scotland]], accessed 2 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early British Empire===
The [[British Empire]] expanded in this time to include [[colony|colonies]], [[protectorate]]s, and [[Dominion]]s throughout the [[Americas]], [[Africa]], [[Asia]] and [[Australasia]]. Although the [[Royal Navy]] is widely regarded as having been vital for the rise of the [[British Empire]], and British dominance of the world, the British Army played an important role in the colonisation of India and other regions.&lt;ref&gt;Mallinson, p. 104&lt;/ref&gt; Typical tasks included [[garrison]]ing the colonies, capturing strategically important territories, and participating in actions to pacify colonial borders, provide support to allied governments, suppress Britain's rivals, and protect against foreign powers and hostile natives.

[[File:Benjamin West 005.jpg|thumb|left|The death of [[James Wolfe|General Wolfe]] during the [[Battle of the Plains of Abraham]]; the campaigns of the [[French and Indian War]] resulted in British control of modern Canada.]]
British troops also helped capture strategically important territories, allowing their empire to expand throughout the globe. The army also involved itself in numerous wars meant to pacify the borders, or to prop-up friendly governments, and thereby keep other, competitive, empires away from the British Empire's borders. Among these actions were the [[Seven Years' War]],&lt;ref name=ma106&gt;Mallinson, p. 106&lt;/ref&gt; the [[American Revolutionary War]],&lt;ref&gt;Mallinson, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Napoleonic Wars]],&lt;ref name=ma165&gt;Mallinson, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; the [[First Opium War|First]] and [[Second Opium War]]s,&lt;ref name=ma102&gt;Mallinson, p. 102&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Boxer Rebellion]],&lt;ref name=boxer&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=lXkvEIUmg68C&amp;pg=PA25&amp;dq=%22nationalist+Boxers%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=V6PeTI3FG4K0lQfjyLmVAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22nationalist%20Boxers%22&amp;f=false|title=Rising Star: China's New Security Diplomacy|author=Bates Gill|year=2010|publisher=Brookings Institution Press|location=|page=25|isbn=9780815704539|pages=|accessdate=2010-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[New Zealand land wars]],&lt;ref name=nz&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.army.mil.nz/culture-and-history/nz-army-history/historical-chronology/1827.htm |title=New Zealand Army: Timeline |publisher=Army.mil.nz |date=2008-12-19 |accessdate=2011-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Sepoy Rebellion of 1857]],&lt;ref name=ma210&gt;Mallinson, p. 210&lt;/ref&gt; the [[First Boer War|First]] and [[Second Boer War]]s,&lt;ref name=ma257&gt;Mallinson, p. 257&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Fenian raids]],&lt;ref name=fenian&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doyle.com.au/fenian_raids.htm |title=The Fenian Raids |publisher=Doyle.com.au |date=2001-09-15 |accessdate=2011-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Irish War of Independence]],&lt;ref name=ma102&gt;Mallinson, p. 282&lt;/ref&gt; its serial interventions into [[Afghanistan]] (which were meant to maintain a friendly [[buffer state]] between British India and the [[Russian Empire]]),&lt;ref&gt;Mallinson, p. 203&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Crimean War]] (to keep the Russian Empire at a safe distance by coming to Turkey's aid).&lt;ref name=ma195&gt;Mallinson, p. 195&lt;/ref&gt;

As had its predecessor, the [[English Army]], the British Army fought [[Spain]], [[France]], and the [[Netherlands]] for supremacy in [[North America]] and the [[West Indies]]. With native and provincial assistance, the Army conquered [[New France]] in the [[Seven Years' War]]&lt;ref name=ma106/&gt; and subsequently suppressed a [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] uprising in [[Pontiac's War]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.umbc.edu/che/tahlessons/pdf/Pontiacs_War(PrinterFriendly).pdf Pontiac’s War] Baltimore County Public Schools&lt;/ref&gt; The British Army suffered defeat in the [[American War of Independence]], losing the [[Thirteen Colonies]] but holding on to [[Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;Mallinson, p. 110&lt;/ref&gt;

The British Army was heavily involved in the [[Napoleonic Wars]] in which the army served in multiple campaigns across [[Europe]] (including continuous deployment in the [[Peninsular War]]), the [[Caribbean]], [[North Africa]] and later in [[War of 1812|North America]]. The war between the British and the [[First French Empire]] of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] stretched around the world and at its peak, in 1813, the regular army contained over 250,000 men. A British Army under the [[Duke of Wellington]] defeated Napoleons last campaign at the [[Battle of Waterloo]] in 1815.&lt;ref&gt;Mallinson, p. 177&lt;/ref&gt;

The English had been involved, both politically and militarily, in Ireland since being given the [[Lordship of Ireland]] by the pope in 1171. English republican dictator, [[Oliver Cromwell]]'s campaign was characterised by its uncompromising treatment of the Irish towns (most notably [[Drogheda]]) that had supported the Royalists during the English Civil War. The English Army (and subsequently the British Army)stayed in Ireland primarily to suppress numerous Irish revolts and campaigns for independence. It was faced with the prospect of battling Anglo-Irish and [[Ulster-Scots|Ulster Scots]] peoples in Ireland, who alongside their other Irish groups had raised their own volunteer army and threatened to emulate the American colonists if their conditions were not met. The British Army found itself fighting Irish rebels, both Protestant and Catholic, primarily in [[Ulster]] and [[Leinster]] ([[Theobald Wolfe Tone|Wolfe Tone's]] [[United Irishmen]]) in the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798|1798 rebellion]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/empire_seapower/irish_reb_01.shtml The 1798 Irish Rebellion] BBC&lt;/ref&gt;

Following William and Mary's accession to the throne, [[England]] involved itself in the [[War of the Grand Alliance]] primarily to prevent a French invasion restoring Mary's father, [[James II of England|James II]].&lt;ref&gt;Miller, p. 144&lt;/ref&gt; Following the 1707 [[Acts of Union 1707|union of England and Scotland]], and the 1801 creation of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]], British foreign policy, on the continent, was to contain expansion by its competitor powers such as [[France]] and [[Spain]]. The territorial ambitions of the French led to the [[War of the Spanish Succession]]&lt;ref&gt;Mallinson, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Napoleonic Wars]].&lt;ref name=ma165/&gt; Russian activity led to the [[Crimean War]].&lt;ref name=ma195/&gt; After 1745 recruits were increasingly drawn from Scotland; by the mid-1760s between one fifth and one third of officers were from Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford Illustrated History of the British Army'' (1994) p. 103&lt;/ref&gt;

The vastly increasing demands of imperial expansion, and the inadequacies and inefficiencies of the underfunded, post-Napoleonic Wars British Army, and of the [[Militia (United Kingdom)|Militia]], [[Yeomanry]], and [[Volunteer Force (Great Britain)|Volunteer Force]], led to the [[Cardwell Reforms|Cardwell]] and [[Childers Reforms]] of the late 19th century, which gave the British Army its modern shape, and redefined its [[regimental system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=24992|supp=|startpage=3300|date=1 July 1881|accessdate=2010-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Haldane Reforms]] of 1907, formally created the [[Territorial Force]] as the Army's volunteer reserve component.&lt;ref&gt;Cassidy, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;

Great Britain's dominance of the world had been challenged by numerous other powers, notably [[German Empire|Germany]]. The UK was allied with France (by the [[Entente Cordiale]]) and Russia, and when the [[First World War]] broke out in 1914, the British Army sent the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]] to France and Belgium to prevent Germany from occupying these countries.&lt;ref&gt;Ensor, pp. 525–526&lt;/ref&gt; The War would be the most devastating in British military history, with near 800,000 men killed and over 2&amp;nbsp;million wounded. In the early part of the war, the professional force of the BEF was decimated and, by turns, a volunteer (and then conscripted) force replaced it. Major battles included the [[Battle of the Somme]].&lt;ref&gt;Mallinson, p. 310&lt;/ref&gt; Advances in technology saw advent of the [[tank]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20071014050900/http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/worldwars/wwone/nonflash_tank.shtml |title=Mark I tank |publisher=Web.archive.org |date= |accessdate=2011-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the creation of the [[Royal Tank Regiment]], and advances in [[aircraft]] design, with the creation of the [[Royal Flying Corps]], which were to be decisive in future battles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rafmuseum.org.uk/milestones-of-flight/british_military/1914_3.cfm |title=British Military Aviation in 1914 |publisher=Rafmuseum.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Trench warfare]] dominated strategy on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], and the use of chemical and poison gases added to the devastation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Saturday, 22 August 2009 Michael Duffy |url=http://www.firstworldwar.com/weaponry/gas.htm |title=Weapons of War: Poison Gas |publisher=Firstworldwar.com |date=2009-08-22 |accessdate=2011-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Second World War]] broke out in 1939 with the German invasion of [[Poland]].&lt;ref name=ma335&gt;Mallinson, p. 335&lt;/ref&gt; British assurances to the Polish led the British Empire to declare war on Germany.

===Postcolonial era===
[[File:Argentine POWs guarded by 2 Para.jpg|thumb|right|Soldiers from the [[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|Parachute Regiment]] guard [[Argentina|Argentine]] [[prisoners of war]] during the [[Falklands War]].]]
After the end of the Second World War, the British Army was significantly reduced in size, although [[National Service]] continued until 1960.&lt;ref name=&quot;M 384&quot;&gt;Mallinson, p. 384&lt;/ref&gt; This period also saw the process of [[Decolonisation]] commence with the end of the [[British Raj]], and the independence of other colonies in Africa and Asia. Accordingly the army's strength was further reduced, in recognition of Britain's reduced role in world affairs, outlined in the [[1957 Defence White Paper]].&lt;ref&gt;Merged regiments and new brigading – many famous units to lose separate identity, The Times, 25 July 1957&lt;/ref&gt; This was despite major actions in [[Korean War|Korea]] in 1950&lt;ref name=&quot;M 384&quot;/&gt; and [[Suez Crisis|Suez]] in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;Mallinson, p. 407&lt;/ref&gt; A large force of [[British Army of the Rhine|British troops]] also remained in Germany, facing the threat of [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] invasion.&lt;ref&gt;Mallinson, p. 440&lt;/ref&gt; The [[British Army of the Rhine]] was the Germany garrison formation, with the main fighting force being [[I Corps (United Kingdom)|I (BR) Corps]]. The [[Cold War]] saw significant technological advances in warfare and the Army saw more technologically advanced weapons systems come into service.&lt;ref&gt;Mallinson, p. 442&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the decline of the [[British Empire]], the Army was still deployed around the world, fighting colonial wars in [[Aden Emergency|Aden]],&lt;ref name=ma401&gt;Mallinson, p. 401&lt;/ref&gt; [[EOKA|Cyprus]],&lt;ref name=ma401/&gt; [[Mau Mau Uprising|Kenya]]&lt;ref name=ma401/&gt; and [[Malayan Emergency|Malaya]].&lt;ref&gt;Mallinson, p. 402&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982 the British Army, alongside the [[Royal Marines]], helped to recapture the [[Falkland Islands]] during the [[Falklands War|war]] against [[Argentina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britains-smallwars.com/Museum/Falklands/falkSurrenderDocument.html |title=Falklands Surrender Document |publisher=Britains-smallwars.com |date=1982-06-14 |accessdate=2011-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the three decades following 1969, the Army was heavily deployed in [[Northern Ireland]], to support the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] (later the [[Police Service of Northern Ireland]]) in their conflict with republican paramilitary groups, called [[Operation Banner]].&lt;ref&gt;Mallinson, p. 411&lt;/ref&gt; The locally-recruited [[Ulster Defence Regiment]] was formed, later becoming the [[The Royal Irish Regiment (27th (Inniskilling) 83rd and 87th and Ulster Defence Regiment)|Royal Irish Regiment]] in 1992. Over 700 soldiers were killed during the [[Troubles]]. Following the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]] ceasefires between 1994 and 1996 and since 1997, demilitarisation has taken place as part of the peace process, reducing the military presence from 30,000 to 5,000 troops.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/6923342.stm Army ending its operation in NI] BBC News, 31 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 June 2007, the Second Battalion Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment vacated the Army complex at Bessbrook Mill in Armagh.

== Formation and structure ==
{{British Army Arms}}
{{Main|Structure of the British Army}}

The structure of the British Army is complex, due to the different origins of its various constituent parts. It is broadly split into the Regular Army (full-time Officers/soldiers and units) and the [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] (Spare-time Officers/soldiers and units).

In terms of its military structure, it has two parallel organisations, one administrative and one operational.

'''Administrative'''
* Regiments and Corps. These are listed below (in the template to the right), ranging from the [[Household Cavalry]] to the [[Army Physical Training Corps]] and the [[Royal Logistic Corps]]. Uniquely and somewhat confusingly, the Infantry, which is not a corps but a collection of separate regiments, is administered by 'Divisions' of infantry – [[Guards Division]], [[Queen's Division]], [[Scottish Division]] and so on.&lt;ref&gt;Heyman, p.105&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Operational'''
* The major operational command is [[HQ Land Forces]] (following the amalgamation of Land Command and Headquarters [[Adjutant-General to the Forces|Adjutant General]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.drumbeat.org.uk/resources/133JUN08.PDF HQ Land Forces on the move] Drumbeat, June 2008&lt;/ref&gt; It is split into divisions and subordinate units ranging from regiments to squadrons.
* [[Division (military)|Divisions]] both operational (1 Div. based in [[Herford]] in [[Germany]] and 3 Div. based in [[Bulford]])&lt;ref&gt;Heyman, p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; and regional divisions (effectively [[military district]]s) administrating all military units, both Regular and TA, within a geographical area (2 Div. based in [[Edinburgh]], 4 Div. based in [[Aldershot]] and 5 Div. based in [[Shrewsbury]]).&lt;ref&gt;Heyman, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Brigade]]s, both fighting and in a non fighting regional capacity within HQ LF (for example,, 43 (Wessex) [[Brigade]] based in [[Bulford]]).

=== Structure of units===

The standard operational units are structured as follows, although various units have their own structure, conventions, names and sizes:&lt;ref name=&quot;SAS&quot;&gt;{{Cite web

|[[Corporal#United Kingdom|Cpl]]
|[[Chosen man|LCpl]]
|}

[[Corps]] are made up of two or more divisions, but are now unlikely to be deployed as a purely national formation due to the size of the British Army; for example,, the [[Allied Rapid Reaction Corps|ARRC]].&lt;ref name=&quot;SAS&quot;/&gt;

In place of a Battalion, a task-specific [[Battlegroup (army)|Battlegroup]] may be formed. A battlegroup is grown around the core of either an armoured regiment or infantry battalion, and has other units added or removed from it as necessary for its purpose. It results in a mixed formation of armour, infantry, artillery, engineers and support units, typically consisting of between 600 and 700 soldiers under the command of a Lieutenant Colonel.&lt;ref name=&quot;SAS&quot;/&gt;

A number of elements of the British Army use alternative terms for battalion, company and platoon. These include the [[Royal Armoured Corps]], [[Corps of Royal Engineers]], [[Royal Logistic Corps]], and the [[Royal Corps of Signals]] who use regiment (battalion), [[Squadron (cavalry)|squadron]] (company) and [[troop]] (platoon). The [[Royal Artillery]] are unique in using the term regiment in place of both [[corps]] and [[battalion]], they also replace company with [[artillery battery|battery]] and platoon with troop.&lt;ref name=&quot;SAS&quot;/&gt;

=== Divisions ===

The British Army currently has 6 divisions with two (1st Armoured Division and 3rd Infantry Division) being at continual operational readiness for deployment.&lt;ref&gt;Heyman, pp. 92–93&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Aviation components ===

The British Army operates alongside the [[Royal Air Force]] as part of a Joint Force, but the army also has its own [[Army Air Corps (United Kingdom)|Army Air Corps]]. Military helicopters of all three services are commanded by [[Joint Helicopter Command]], a joint 2 star headquarters operating under HQ Land Forces.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/+/http://www.mod.uk/issues/sdr/jhc.htm Joint Helicopter Command] Strategic Defence Review&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Overseas Territories military units ===

Numerous military units were raised historically in British territories, including self-governing and Crown colonies, and protectorates. Few of these have appeared on the Army List, and their relationship to the British Army has been ambiguous. Whereas Dominions, such as Canada and Australia, raised their own armies, the defence of Crown possessions (like the Channel Islands), and colonies (now called [[British Overseas Territory|Overseas Territories]]) was, and is, the responsibility of the UK (due to their status as territories of Britain, not British protectorates). All military forces of overseas territories are, therefore, under the direct command of the UK Government, via the local Governor and Commander-In-Chief.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

=== Royal Navy and RAF ground units ===
The other armed services have their own infantry units which are not part of the British Army. The [[Royal Marines]] are amphibious [[light infantry]] forming part of the [[Naval Service (United Kingdom)|Naval Service]], and the [[Royal Air Force]] has the [[RAF Regiment]] used for airfield defence, force protection duties and Forward Air Control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.raf.mod.uk/rafregiment/ |title=RAF Regiment |publisher=Raf.mod.uk |date=2010-09-23 |accessdate=2011-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Modern equipment of the British Army}}

'''Infantry'''
The basic infantry weapon of the British Army is the [[SA80|L85A2]] assault rifle, sometimes equipped with an [[L17A2 UGL|L17A2]] underbarrel grenade launcher and with several variants such as the [[Light Support Weapon|L86A2]], the Light Support Weapon (LSW) and the L22A2 carbine variant, issued to tank crews. Support fire is provided by the [[FN Minimi]] light machine gun and the [[L7 (machine gun)|L7 General Purpose Machine Gun]] (GPMG); indirect fire by [[British 51&amp;nbsp;mm Mortar|51]] and [[L16 81mm Mortar|81&amp;nbsp;mm mortars]]. Sniper rifles used include the [[L118A1]]&amp;nbsp;7.62&amp;nbsp;mm, the [[L115A3]] and the [[AW50F]], all produced by [[Accuracy International]]. Some units use the [[M82 Barrett rifle|L82A1]]&amp;nbsp;.50 calibre Barrett sniper rifle. More recently the [[L128A1]] (Benelli M4) 'combat shotgun' has been adopted, and is intended for close quarters combat in Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.army.mod.uk/equipment/support-weapons/17927.aspx |title=Combat Shotgun – British Army Website |publisher=Army.mod.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-10-22|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uKgzKZWI |archivedate = 2010-11-18|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2009/04/10/british-armys-new-combat-shotgun/ |title=British Army’s new combat shotgun |publisher=The Firearm Blog |date=2009-04-10 |accessdate=2010-10-22|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uKgzjJBU |archivedate = 2010-11-18|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Armour'''
The British Army's [[main battle tank]] is [[Challenger 2]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baesystems.com/ProductsServices/l_and_a_ls_challenger.html Challenger 2] BA Systems&lt;/ref&gt; Other armoured vehicles include [[MWMIK|Supacat &quot;Jackal&quot; MWMIK]] and the [[Iveco LMV|Iveco &quot;Panther&quot; CLV]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defense-update.com/products/m/MLV.htm |title=Multi-role Light Vehicle |publisher=Defense-update.com |date=2006-07-26 |accessdate=2011-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Warrior Infantry Fighting Vehicle]] is the primary [[armoured personnel carrier]], although many variants of the [[Combat Vehicle Reconnaissance (tracked)]] are used, as well as the [[Saxon APC]] and [[FV430 series]] now being re-engined and uparmoured and returned to front line service as [[FV432#Bulldog|Bulldog]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sloppyjalopy.com/fv432.htm |title=FV 432 |publisher=Sloppyjalopy.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British Army commonly uses the [[Land Rover Wolf]] and [[Land Rover Defender]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.landrover.com/gb/en/lr/defender/ |title=Land Rover Defender |publisher=Landrover.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Artillery'''
The Army uses three main artillery systems: the [[MLRS|Multi Launch Rocket System]] (MLRS), [[AS-90]] and [[L118]]. The MLRS was first used operationally in [[Operation Granby]] and has a range of {{convert|70|km|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.army.mod.uk/equipment/artillery-air-defence/1512.aspx GMLRS] British Army&lt;/ref&gt; The AS-90 is a 155&amp;nbsp;mm self-propelled gun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.armedforces.co.uk/army/listings/l0046.html |title=AS-90 |publisher=Armedforces.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The L118 Light Gun is a 105&amp;nbsp;mm towed gun used primarily in support of 16 Air Assault Brigade, 19 Light Brigade and 3 Commando Brigade ([[Royal Marines]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baesystems.com/ProductsServices/l_and_a_ls_105mm_light_gun.html 105 mm Light Gun] BAe Systems&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Rapier (missile)|Rapier FSC Missile System]] is the Army's primary battlefield air defence system, widely deployed since the [[Falklands War]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.armedforces-int.com/projects/rapier_missile.html |title=Rapier missile |publisher=Armedforces-int.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Starstreak (missile)|Starstreak HVM]] (High Velocity Missile) is a surface-to-air weapon, launched either by a single soldier or from a vehicle-mounted launcher.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.janes.com/events/exhibitions/dsei2007/sections/daily/day1/starstreak-ii-sighted.shtml Starstreak II sighted] Janes&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Army Aviation'''
The [[British Army Air Corps|Army Air Corps]] (AAC) provide direct aviation support for the Army, although the RAF also assist in this role. The primary attack helicopter is the [[Westland WAH-64 Apache]], a license-built, modified version of the [[AH-64 Apache]] that will replace the Westland Lynx AH7 in the anti-tank role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.army.mod.uk/equipment/aircraft/1531.aspx |title=Apache |publisher=Army.mod.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bell 212]] is used as a specialist utility and transport helicopter, with a crew of two and a transport capacity of 12 troops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vectorsite.net/avhuey.html |title=Bell Huey |publisher=Vectorsite.net |date= |accessdate=2011-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Westland Gazelle]] helicopter is a light helicopter, primarily used for battlefield reconnaissance and control of artillery and aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.army.mod.uk/equipment/aircraft/1533.aspx Gazelle] British Army&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Eurocopter Dauphin|Eurocopter AS 365N Dauphin]] is used for Special Operations Aviation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Janes Defence Weekly, Vol. 45, Issue 50 |date=10 December 2008|page=10|title=UK Army Air Corps received Dauphins|author=Tim Ripley}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Britten-Norman Islander]] is a light aircraft used for airborne reconnaissance and command.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britten-norman.com/products/bn2b/ |title=Islander |publisher=Britten-norman.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recruitment ==
The Army mainly recruits within the United Kingdom; it normally has a recruitment target of around 12,000 soldiers per year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/5261834.stm Army recruitment increases by 9%] BBC News, 18 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Low unemployment in Britain has resulted in the Army having difficulty in meeting its target. In the early years of the 21st century there has been a marked increase in the number of recruits from other (mostly [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]]) countries. In 2006 overseas recruitment, mostly in Commonwealth countries, generated more than 6,000 soldiers from 54 nations; together with the 3,000 Gurkhas, 10% of the British Army is a foreign national.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2007/02/british-army-recruitment-iraq Britain's child army] ''New Statesman'', 5 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] now caps the number of recruits from Commonwealth countries, although this will not affect the Gurkhas. If the trend continues 10% of the army will be from Commonwealth countries before 2012. The cap is in place as some fear the army's [[Britishness|British character]] is being diluted, and employing too many could make the army seen as employing [[mercenaries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2008/apr/05/military.defence|title= Commonwealth recruitment caps &amp; current commonwealth troop levels.| publisher= Guardian Newspaper|date= 2008-04-05| location=London | accessdate=2010-04-01 | first=Richard | last=Norton-Taylor|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uKh00P9q |archivedate = 2010-11-18|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The minimum recruitment age is 16&amp;nbsp;years (after the end of [[GCSE]]s), although soldiers may not serve on operations below 18&amp;nbsp;years; the maximum recruitment age was raised in January 2007 from 26 to 33&amp;nbsp;years. The normal term of engagement is 22&amp;nbsp;years, and, once enlisted, soldiers are not normally permitted to leave until they have served at least 4&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Recruitment Age for Army Raised | publisher= | date=2007-01-06 | work=BBC News | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6236345.stm | accessdate=2007-01-12 |archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uKh1JTZ7 |archivedate = 2010-11-18|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been a strong and continuing tradition of recruiting from Ireland including what is now the [[Republic of Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article4724617.ece|title=Irish recruits sign up for British Army in cross-border revolution|publisher=The Times|date=September 10, 2008|quote=Army recruitment in Northern Ireland has just revealed that 16 per cent of all those enlisting since April were from south of the border.

=== Oath of allegiance ===
[[File:Queens.guard.buck.palace.arp.jpg|thumb|right|Troops of the [[Grenadier Guards]] on guard at [[Buckingham Palace]]. Various army regiments supply troops to guard the Royal residences.]]

All soldiers must take an oath of allegiance upon joining the Army, a process known as ''attestation''. Those who believe in [[God]], and wish to swear by Him, use the following words:

{{quote|I (your name), swear by Almighty God that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II]], her heirs and successors and that I will as in duty bound honestly and faithfully defend Her Majesty, her heirs and successors in person, [[British Crown|crown]] and dignity against all enemies and will observe and obey all orders of Her Majesty, her heirs and successors and of the generals and officers set over me.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whodareswins.com/british-army-oath-of-allegiance.html#selfless |title=British Army Oath of Allegiance |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2010-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Others replace the words &quot;swear by Almighty God&quot; with &quot;solemnly, sincerely and truly declare and affirm&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.army.mod.uk/documents/general/v_s_of_the_british_army.pdf |title=Values and Standards of the British Army |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British Army does not have its own specific ensign for the whole Army, unlike the Royal Navy, which uses the [[White Ensign]], and the RAF, which uses the [[Royal Air Force Ensign]]. Instead, the Army has different flags and ensigns, some for the entire army and many for the different regiments and corps. The official flag of the Army as a whole is the [[Union Flag]], flown in a ratio of 3:5. A non-ceremonial flag also exists, which is used at recruiting events, military events and exhibitions. It also flies from the Ministry of Defence building in Whitehall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishflags.net/British%20Army.html |title=British Army (non-ceremonial) |publisher=britishflags.net |date= |accessdate=2010-10-22|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uKh1taVz |archivedate = 2010-11-18|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whilst at war, the Union Flag is always used, and this flag represents the Army on the [[Cenotaph]] in [[Whitehall]], [[London]] (the UK's memorial to its war dead).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5kwQhSm7w |title=Whitehall Cenotaph |publisher=Webcitation.org |date= |accessdate=2011-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British Army has throughout its history operated ships, ports and a myriad of boats. [[Rigid Raider|Boats]], [[Landing Craft]] and [[Marchwood Military Port|Ports]] are still operated by the Army and ensigns exists for vessels commanded by the Army. The [[Royal Logistic Corps]] operates a large fleet of vessels from its base at Marchwood near [[Southampton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.army.mod.uk/rlc/regiments/17957.aspx |title=17 Port &amp; Maritime Regiment RLC |publisher=Army.mod.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Royal Engineers]] has had fleets since the introduction of diving in 1838 and was granted an ensign following the foundation of the [[Royal Engineers]] Submarine Mining Service in 1871, where it operated [[sea mine]] laying ships, before transfer of the trade to the [[Royal Navy]]. The Corps maintains a [[Blue Ensign]] defaced by the crest of the [[Board of Ordnance]] from where the Corps developed, which it flys from its fleet and shore establishments that routinely operate boats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fotw.net/flags/gb%5Erets.html |title=Royal Engineers ensign |publisher=Fotw.net |date= |accessdate=2011-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each [[Foot Guards]] and line regiment (excluding [[The Rifles]] and [[Royal Gurkha Rifles]] (RGR)) also has its own flags, known as [[Colours, standards and guidons|Colours]]—normally a Regimental Colour and a Queen's Colour. The design of different Regimental Colours. vary but typically the colour has the Regiment's badge in the centre. The RGR carry the [[Queen's Truncheon]] in place of Colours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thegurkhamuseum.co.uk/Research/History_And_Facts/The_Queens_Truncheon/27 |title=The Queen's Truncheon |publisher=Thegurkhamuseum.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tommy Atkins and other nicknames ==
{{further|[[List of nicknames of British Army regiments]]}}
A long established nickname for a British soldier has been ''[[Tommy Atkins]]'' or ''Tommy'' for short. The origins are obscure but most probably derive from a specimen army form circulated by the Adjutant-General Sir Harry Calvert to all units in 1815 where the blanks had been filled in with the particulars of a Private Thomas Atkins, No 6 Company, 23rd Regiment of Foot. German soldiers in both World Wars would usually refer to their British opponents as ''Tommys''. Present- day British soldiers are often referred to as ''Toms'' or just ''Tom''. The British Army magazine ''Soldier'' has a regular cartoon strip, ''Tom'', featuring the everyday life of a British soldier. Outside of the services, soldiers are generally known as ''squaddies'' by the [[Tabloid press|British popular press]], and the general public.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2010/may/19/war-musical-lads-in-their-hundreds Songs for squaddies: the war musical Lads in Their Hundreds] The Guardian, 19 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Another nickname which applies only to soldiers in Scottish regiments is ''Jock'', derived from the fact that in Scotland the common Christian name John is often changed to Jock in the vernacular.
Welsh soldiers are occasionally referred to as ''Taffy'' or just ''Taff''. This may only apply to those from the Taff-Ely Valley in South Wales, where a large portion of men, left unemployed from the decline of the coal industry in the area, enlisted during WW I and WW II. Alternatively, it is derived from the supposed Welsh pronunciation of ''Dafydd''&lt;ref&gt;The Concise Oxford Dictionary ISBN 978-0-19-861131-8&lt;/ref&gt; – the vernacular form of Dave or Davey, the patron Saint of Wales being Saint David.&lt;ref&gt;''Collins English Dictionary'' ISBN 0-00-716334-7&lt;/ref&gt;
Irish soldiers are referred to as ''Paddy'' or ''Mick''.

Junior officers in the army are sometimes known as ''Ruperts'' by the [[Other ranks]]. This nickname is believed to be derived from the children's comic book character [[Rupert Bear]] who epitomizes traditional [[Public school (UK)|public school]] values.&lt;ref&gt;Beevor, Anthony, ''Inside the British Army'', ISBN 0-00-71134658&lt;/ref&gt;

      <comment>/* Calculations with Bayesian probabilities */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Bayesian probability''' is one of the different [[Probability interpretations|interpretations]] of the concept of [[probability]] and belongs to the category of evidential probabilities. The Bayesian interpretation of probability can be seen as an extension of [[propositional logic|logic]] that enables reasoning with uncertain statements. To evaluate the probability of a [[hypothesis]], the Bayesian probabilist specifies some prior probability, which is then updated in the light of new relevant data. The Bayesian interpretation provides a standard set of procedures and formulae to perform this calculation. Bayesian probability interprets the concept of [[probability]] as &quot;a measure of a state of knowledge&quot;,&lt;ref name = &quot;ghxaib&quot;&gt;ET. Jaynes. ''Probability Theory: The Logic of Science'' Cambridge University Press, (2003). ISBN 0-521-59271-2&lt;/ref&gt; in contrast to interpreting it as a [[frequentist|frequency]] or a [[propensity probability|&quot;propensity&quot; of some phenomenon]].

&quot;Bayesian&quot; refers to the 18th century mathematician and theologian [[Thomas Bayes]] (1702&amp;ndash;1761), who provided the first mathematical treatment of a non-trivial problem of Bayesian inference.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen M. Stigler (1986) The history of statistics. Harvard University press. pg 131.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, it was the French mathematician [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] (1749&amp;ndash;1827) who pioneered and popularized what is now called Bayesian probability.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen M. Stigler (1986) The history of statistics. Harvard University press. pg 97-98, pg 131.&lt;/ref&gt;

Broadly speaking, there are two views on Bayesian probability that interpret the ''state of knowledge'' concept in different ways. According to the ''objectivist view'', the rules of Bayesian statistics can be justified by [[Cox's theorem|requirements of rationality and consistency]] and interpreted as an extension of [[logic]].&lt;ref name = &quot;ghxaib&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;vkdmsn&quot;&gt;Richard T. Cox, Algebra of Probable Inference, The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''subjectivist view'', the state of knowledge measures a &quot;personal belief&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Finetti, B. 1974&quot;&gt;de Finetti, B. (1974) Theory of probability (2 vols.), J. Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., New York&lt;/ref&gt; Many modern [[machine learning]] methods are based on objectivist Bayesian principles.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Bishop, CM., Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning. Springer, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In the Bayesian view, a probability is assigned to a hypothesis, whereas under the [[frequentist| frequentist view]], a hypothesis is typically [[hypothesis test|tested]] without being assigned a probability.

== Calculations with Bayesian probabilities==
{{Main|Bayes' theorem|Bayesian inference}}
[[Bayes' theorem]] is one of the main tools for manipulating probabilities of any kind; that is, it is applicable no matter what interpretation is being placed on the probabilities being manipulated. [[Bayesian inference]] is a formal approach to making [[statistical inference]]s in cases where some of the probabilities are interpreted as representing beliefs, or knowledge, rather than having a [[frequency probability|frequency-based interpretation]]. While &quot;Bayesian inference&quot; makes uses of Bayes' theorem, not all cases where Bayes' theorem is applied should be labeled as &quot;Bayesian statistics&quot; or &quot;Bayesian inference&quot;.

The use of Bayes' theorem in Bayesian inference may be described as follows. Let ''H'' denote a hypothesis; that a certain statement of supposed fact is true, or that a [[statistical parameter]] takes a certain value. Before observing data from a given experiment, one starts with some belief about whether the hypothesis ''H'' is true, expressed in the form of a probability, usually called the [[prior probability]]. Bayes' theorem is used to determine what one's probability for the hypothesis should be, once the outcome ''D'' from the experiment is known. The phrase &quot;should be&quot; is important here, as Bayes' theorem is a condensation of the rules that anyone should apply to updating beliefs, provided that they are acting according to reasonable rules of [[Cox's theorem|requirements of rationality and consistency]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ghxaib&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;vkdmsn&quot; /&gt; The probability of the hypothesis once the outcome from the experiment is known is called the [[posterior probability]].

The posterior probability is proportional to the [[likelihood]] of the observed data, multiplied by the [[prior probability]], and is given by Bayes' theorem. Thus

: &lt;Math&gt; \operatorname{P}(H|D) = \frac{\operatorname{P}(D|H)\;\operatorname{P}(H)}{\operatorname{P}(D)},&lt;/math&gt;

where

* &lt;Math&gt;\operatorname{P}(H)&lt;/math&gt; is the ''[[prior probability]]'' of ''H'': the probability that ''H'' is correct before the data ''D'' are seen.
* &lt;Math&gt;\operatorname{P}(D|H)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[conditional probability]] of seeing the data ''D'' given that the hypothesis ''H'' is true. This conditional probability is called the ''[[likelihood]]''.
* &lt;Math&gt;\operatorname{P}(D)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[marginal probability]] of ''D''.
* &lt;Math&gt;\operatorname{P}(H|D)&lt;/math&gt; is the ''[[posterior probability]]'': the probability that the hypothesis is true, given the data and the previous state of belief about the hypothesis.

The quantity &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{P}(D)&lt;/math&gt; is the prior probability of witnessing the data ''D'' under all possible hypotheses, and it depends on the prior probabilities given to each of these other possible hypotheses. Given any [[Collectively exhaustive events|exhaustive]] set of [[mutually exclusive]] hypotheses ''H&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'',

: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{P}(D) = \sum_i  \operatorname{P}(D, H_i) = \sum_i  \operatorname{P}(D|H_i)\operatorname{P}(H_i).\,&lt;/math&gt;

Here ''i'' can be considered to index alternative cases, of which exactly one is actually valid, and ''H&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the hypothesis that case ''i'' is valid. Then &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{P}(D, H_i)&lt;/math&gt; is the probability that both case ''i'' is valid and that the data from the experiment turn out to be what was observed. Since the set of alternative cases is assumed to be mutually exclusive and exhaustive, the above formula is a case of the [[law of total probability]]. In many cases, &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{P}(D)&lt;/math&gt;, which is a  [[normalizing constant]], need not be evaluated. As a result, Bayes' formula is often simplified to:

: &lt;Math&gt;\operatorname{P}(H|D) \propto \operatorname{P}(D|H)\;\operatorname{P}(H), &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\propto&lt;/math&gt; denotes [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportionality]].

==Bayesian methodology==

In general, Bayesian methods are characterized by the following concepts and procedures:

* The use of [[Hierarchical Bayes model|hierarchical models]] and [[Marginalization (probability)|marginalization]] over the values of [[nuisance parameter]]s. In most cases, the computation is intractable, but good approximations can be obtained using [[Markov chain Monte Carlo]] methods.
* The ''sequential use of the Bayes' formula'': when more data becomes available after calculating a posterior distribution, the posterior becomes the next prior.
* In frequentist statistics, a [[Statistical hypothesis testing|hypothesis]] is a [[Proposition#Treatment_in_logic|proposition]] (which must be [[principle of bivalence|either true or false]]), so that the (frequentist) probability of a frequentist hypothesis is either one or zero. In Bayesian statistics, a &lt;!-- not necessarily 0 or 1 --&gt;probability can be assigned to a hypothesis.

==Objective and subjective Bayesian probabilities==

Broadly speaking, there are two views on Bayesian probability that interpret the 'state of knowledge' concept in different ways. For '''objectivists''', the rules of Bayesian statistics can be justified by [[Cox's theorem|requirements of rationality and consistency]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ghxaib&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;vkdmsn&quot; /&gt; Such requirements of rationality and consistency are also important for '''subjectivists''', for which the state of knowledge corresponds to a 'personal belief' (rather than the objective state of knowledge in the world).&lt;ref name=&quot;Finetti, B. 1974&quot; /&gt; For subjectivists however, rationality and consistency constrain the probabilities a subject may have, but allow for substantial variation within those constraints. The objective and subjective variants of Bayesian probability differ mainly in their interpretation and construction of the prior probability.

==History==
{{Main|History of statistics#Bayesian statistics}}

The term ''Bayesian'' refers to [[Thomas Bayes]] (1702&amp;ndash;1761), who proved a special case of what is now called [[Bayes' theorem]]. However, it was [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] (1749&amp;ndash;1827) who introduced a general version of the theorem and used it to approach problems in [[celestial mechanics]], medical statistics, [[Reliability (statistics)|reliability]], and [[jurisprudence]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephen M. Stigler (1986) The history of statistics. Harvard University press. Chapter 3.&lt;/ref&gt;  Early Bayesian inference, which used uniform priors following Laplace's [[principle of insufficient reason]], was called &quot;[[inverse probability]]&quot; (because it [[Inductive reasoning|infer]]s backwards from observations to parameters, or from effects to causes&lt;ref name=Fienberg2006&gt;Stephen. E. Fienberg, (2006) [http://ba.stat.cmu.edu/journal/2006/vol01/issue01/fienberg.pdf &quot;When did Bayesian Inference become &quot;Bayesian&quot;?] ''Bayesian Analysis'', 1 (1), 1&amp;ndash;40. See page 5.&lt;/ref&gt;). After the 1920s, &quot;inverse probability&quot; was largely supplanted  by a collection of methods that came to be called [[frequentist statistics]].&lt;ref name=Fienberg2006/&gt;

In the 20th century, the ideas of Laplace were further developed in two different directions, giving rise to ''objective'' and ''subjective'' currents in Bayesian practice. In the objectivist stream, the statistical analysis depends on only the model assumed and the data analysed.&lt;ref name=Bernardo&gt;[[José-Miguel Bernardo|JM. Bernardo]] (2005), &quot;Reference analysis&quot;, ''Handbook of statistics'', 25, 17&amp;ndash;90&lt;/ref&gt; No subjective decisions need to be involved. In contrast, &quot;subjectivist&quot; statisticians deny the possibility of fully objective analysis for the general case.

In the 1980s, there was a dramatic growth in research and applications of Bayesian methods, mostly attributed to the discovery of [[Markov chain Monte Carlo]] methods, which removed many of the computational problems, and an increasing interest in nonstandard, complex applications.&lt;ref&gt;Wolpert, RL. (2004) A conversation with James O. Berger, Statistical science, 9, 205&amp;ndash;218&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the growth of Bayesian research, most undergraduate teaching is still based on frequentist statistics.&lt;ref&gt;[[José-Miguel Bernardo|José M. Bernardo]] (2006) [http://www.ime.usp.br/~abe/ICOTS7/Proceedings/PDFs/InvitedPapers/3I2_BERN.pdf A Bayesian mathematical statistics prior]. ICOTS-7&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, Bayesian methods are widely accepted and used, such as for example in the field of [[machine learning]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

==Justification of Bayesian probabilities==

The use of Bayesian probabilities as the basis of [[Bayesian inference]] has been supported by several arguments, such as the [[Cox's theorem|Cox axioms]], the [[Dutch book|Dutch book argument]], arguments based on [[decision theory]] and [[de Finetti's theorem]].

===Axiomatic approach===
[[Richard Threlkeld Cox|Richard T. Cox]] showed that&lt;ref name = &quot;vkdmsn&quot; /&gt; Bayesian updating follows from several axioms, including two [[functional equations]] and the controversial hypothesis that probability should be treated as a [[countably additive measure|continuous]] function. Here &quot;continuity&quot; is equivalent to countable additivity, as proved in measure-theoretic probability books. The countable additivity requirement is rejected (e.g. for being non-falsifiable) by [[Bruno de Finetti]], for example.

===Dutch book approach===
The Dutch book argument was proposed by de Finetti, and is based on betting. A [[Dutch book]] is made when a clever gambler places a set of bets that guarantee a profit, no matter what the outcome is of the bets. If a [[bookmaker]] follows the rules of the Bayesian calculus in the construction of his odds, a Dutch book cannot be made.

However, [[Ian Hacking]] noted that traditional Dutch book arguments did not specify Bayesian updating: they left open the possibility that non-Bayesian updating rules could avoid Dutch books. For example, [[Ian Hacking|Hacking]] writes&lt;ref&gt;Hacking (1967, Section 3, page 316), Hacking (1988, page 124)&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;And neither the Dutch book argument, nor any other in the personalist arsenal of proofs of the probability axioms, entails the dynamic assumption. Not one entails Bayesianism. So the personalist requires the dynamic assumption in order to be Bayesian. It is true that in consistency a personalist could abandon the Bayesian model of learning from experience. [[Salt and Light|Salt could lose its savour]].&quot;

In fact, there are non-Bayesian updating rules that also avoid Dutch books (as discussed in the literature on &quot;probability kinematics&quot; following the publication of [[Richard C. Jeffrey]]'s rule). The additional hypotheses sufficient to (uniquely) specify Bayesian updating are substantial, complicated, and unsatisfactory.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bas van Fraassen|van Frassen, B.]] (1989) ''Laws and Symmetries'', Oxford University Press. ISBN 0198248601&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decision theory approach===
A [[statistical decision theory|decision-theoretic]] justification of the use of Bayesian inference (and hence of Bayesian probabilities) was given by [[Abraham Wald]],{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} who proved that every Bayesian procedure is [[admissible decision rule|admissible]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}
Conversely, every [[admissible decision rule|admissible]] statistical procedure is either a Bayesian procedure or a limit of Bayesian procedures.&lt;ref&gt;Bickel &amp; Doksum (2001, page 32)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal probabilities and objective methods for constructing priors==
Following the work on [[expected utility]] [[optimal decision|theory]] of [[Frank P. Ramsey|Ramsey]] and [[John von Neumann|von Neumann]],  decision-theorists have accounted for [[optimal decision|rational behavior]] using a probability distribution for the agent. Johann Pfanzagl completed the ''[[Theory of Games and Economic Behavior]]'' by providing an axiomatization of subjective probability and utility, a task left uncompleted by von Neumann and [[Oskar Morgenstern]]: their original theory supposed that all the agents had the same probability distribution, as a convenience.&lt;ref&gt;Pfanzagl (1967, 1968)&lt;/ref&gt; Pfanzagl's axiomatization was endorsed by [[Oskar Morgenstern]]: &quot;Von Neumann and I have anticipated&quot; the question whether probabilities &quot;might, perhaps more typically, be subjective and have stated specifically that in the latter case axioms could be found from which could derive the desired numerical utility together with a number for the probabilities (cf. p. 19 of The [[Theory of Games and Economic Behavior]]). We did not carry this out; it was demonstrated by Pfanzagl ... with all the necessary rigor&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Morgenstern (1976, page 65)&lt;/ref&gt;

Ramsey and [[Leonard Jimmie Savage|Savage]] noted that the individual agent's probability distribution could be objectively studied in experiments. The role of judgment and disagreement in science has been recognized since [[Aristotle]] and even more clearly with [[Francis Bacon]]. The objectivity of science lies not in the psychology of individual scientists, but in the process of science and especially in statistical methods, as noted by [[Charles Sanders Peirce|C. S. Peirce]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Recall that the objective methods for falsifying propositions about personal probabilities have been used for a half century, as noted previously. Procedures for [[statistical hypothesis testing|testing hypotheses]] about probabilities (using finite samples) are due to [[Frank P. Ramsey|Ramsey]] (1931) and [[Bruno de Finetti|de Finetti]] (1931, 1937, 1964, 1970). Both [[Bruno de Finetti]] and [[Frank P. Ramsey]] acknowledge{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} their debts to [[pragmatic philosophy]], particularly (for Ramsey) to [[Charles Sanders Peirce|Charles S. Peirce]].

The &quot;Ramsey test&quot; for evaluating probability distributions is implementable in theory, and has kept experimental psychologists occupied for a half century.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson et al. (1957)&lt;/ref&gt;
This work demonstrates that Bayesian-probability propositions can be [[Falsifiability|falsified]], and so meet an empirical criterion of [[Charles Sanders Peirce|Charles S. Peirce]], whose work inspired Ramsey. (This [[falsifiability]]-criterion was popularized by [[Karl Popper]].&lt;ref&gt;http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/popper/#ProDem&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Popper, Karl. (2002) [http://books.google.com/books?id=T76Zd20IYlgC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=logic+of+scientific+discovery&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=eGfU8COmAA&amp;sig=W8TTt29x5sG8aCGpYuWnonDFH8M&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=crC3TJKND46ssAPp06jkCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=falsifiability&amp;f=false &quot;The Logic of Scientific Discovery&quot;] 2nd Edition, Routledge ISBN 0415278430 (Reprint of 1959 translation of 1935 original) Page 57.&lt;/ref&gt;)

Modern work on the experimental evaluation of personal probabilities uses the randomization, [[double blind|blinding]], and Boolean-decision procedures of the Peirce-Jastrow experiment.&lt;ref&gt;Pierce &amp; Jastrow (1885)
&lt;/ref&gt; Since individuals act according to different probability judgements, these agents' probabilities are &quot;personal&quot; (but amenable to objective study).

Personal probabilities are problematic for science and for some applications where decision-makers lack the knowledge or time to specify an informed probability-distribution (on which they are prepared to act). To meet the needs of science and of human limitations, Bayesian statisticians have developed &quot;objective&quot; methods for specifying prior probabilities.

Indeed, some Bayesians have argued the prior state of knowledge defines ''the'' (unique) prior probability-distribution for &quot;regular&quot; statistical problems; cf. [[well-posed problem]]s. Finding the right method for constructing such &quot;objective&quot; priors (for appropriate classes of regular problems) has been the quest of statistical theorists from Laplace to [[John Maynard Keynes]], [[Harold Jeffreys]], and [[Edwin Thompson Jaynes]]: These theorists and their successors have suggested several methods for constructing &quot;objective&quot; priors:
* [[Maximum entropy]]
* [[Haar measure|Transformation group analysis]]
* [[José-Miguel Bernardo|Reference analysis]]
Each of these methods contributes useful priors for &quot;regular&quot; one-parameter problems, and each prior can handle some challenging [[statistical model]]s (with &quot;irregularity&quot; or several parameters). Each of these methods has been useful in Bayesian practice. Indeed, methods for constructing &quot;objective&quot; (alternatively, &quot;default&quot; or &quot;ignorance&quot;) priors have been developed by avowed subjective (or &quot;personal&quot;) Bayesians like [[James Berger (statistician)|James Berger]] ([[Duke University]]) and [[José-Miguel Bernardo]] ([[University of Valencia|Universitat de València]]), simply because{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} such priors are needed for Bayesian practice, particularly in science. Each of these methods gives implausible priors for some problems, and so the quest for &quot;the universal method for constructing priors&quot; continues to attract statistical theorists.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

Thus, the Bayesian statistican needs either to use informed priors (using relevant expertise or previous data) or to choose among the competing methods for constructing &quot;objective&quot; priors.

'''De Benneville &quot;Bert&quot; Bell''' (February 25, 1895 – October 11, 1959) was the [[National Football League]] commissioner from 1946 until his death. He was an assistant football coach at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] (1920–1929), and at [[Temple University]] (1931–1932). He was the co-founder and part owner of the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] (1933–1936), sole owner (1936–1940), and also head coach (1936–1940). He was part-owner of the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] (1940–1946) and head coach for two games (1941). He was inducted into the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] in 1963.

As owner of the Eagles, Bell proposed the creation of a [[NFL draft]] in 1935 which led to its implementation in 1936. His accomplishments as NFL commissioner included presiding over the end of [[racial segregation]] in the NFL in 1946, enacting an antigambling resolution into the NFL constitution in 1947, developing league wide team schedules in the NFL from 1948 to 1952, negotiating the first television broadcast for the NFL and merging the NFL with the [[All-America Football Conference|AAFC]] in 1949, setting television policy for the NFL in 1951, recognizing the [[National Football League Players Association|NFLPA]], and introducing a partial TV revenue sharing plan.

==Early life==

Didinger; Lyons, 2005, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;King, 2005, p. 20.&quot;&gt;King writes, in a book wherein the foreword was written by Bert Bell, that Bell was born in 1894.

Soon thereafter, Bert regularly engaged in football games with neighborhood friends. In 1904 Bert attended the [[Episcopal Academy]], and then the Delancey School, from 1909 to 1911. For high school, Bell enrolled in [[The Haverford School]] in 1911.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lyons, 2010, p. 3-4.&quot;&gt;Lyons, 2010, p. 3-4.&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of the best athletes in the school, and in his senior year he served as captain of the school's football, basketball, and baseball teams,&lt;ref name=&quot;Lyons, 2010, p. 4.&quot;&gt;Lyons, 2010, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;King, 2005, p. 21.&quot;&gt;King, 2005, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;was awarded The Yale Cup, given to 'The pupil who has done the most to promote athletics in the school.'&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;HAVERFORD&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mainlinemedianews.com/articles/2010/03/14/main_line_times/sports/doc4b97f33501911037333855.txt |title=Bert Bell heads Haverford School Hall of Fame induction class|date=March 14, 2010|accessdate=17 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he excelled at baseball, his true passion was football.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lyons, 2010, p. 5.&quot;&gt;Lyons, 2010, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Around this time, his father was &lt;!-- I think in 1905, have to refind it, and I think trustee is same thing as trustee for life --&gt;named trustee for life at Penn and helped form the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lyons, 2010, p. 2.&quot;/&gt; Once commenting on Bert's plans for college, his father said, &quot;Bert will go to Penn or he will go to hell.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lyons, 2010, p. 3.&quot;/&gt;

===University of Pennsylvania===
Bell entered Penn in the fall of 1914 and became the starting quarterback on the freshman [[Penn Quakers]]. His play landed him on the varsity for coach [[George H. Brooke]] as the starting quarterback in 1915, an unusual occurrence for a sophomore.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lyons, 2010, p. 5-7.&quot;&gt;Lyons, 2010, p. 5-7.&lt;/ref&gt; He also played as a defender, punter, and punt returner. &lt;ref name=&quot;PENN POSITIONS&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.upenn.edu/gazette/0909/pro06.html |title=The Man Who Modernized

With Penn's record at 3-0, Bell shared the quarterbacking duties from the fourth thru the seventh games and had mixed success. As a punt returner, his lack of speed caused him to fumble occasionally because he could not get set properly before catching the ball. After Brooke abruptly quit before the eight game, Bell regained the starting quarterback position.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lyons, 2010, p. 6-7.&quot;&gt;Lyons, 2010, p. 6-7.&lt;/ref&gt; Penn finished with a record of 3-5-2 for his inaugural varsity season.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacCambridge, 2009, p. 1080. BROOKE QUITS&quot;&gt;MacCambridge credits all wins, losses and ties from 1915 to Brooke. MacCambridge, 2009, p. 1080.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fleurette passed away on September 24, 1916, while Bell was en route from campus to her bedside. Nevertheless, he started the first game of the 1916 season on September 30 for new coach [[Bob Folwell]]. But again mixed results by Bell caused him to be platooned for the rest of the season.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lyons, 2010, p. 7-8.&quot;&gt;Lyons, 2010, p. 7-8.&lt;/ref&gt; The team finished the regular season with a record of 7-2-1,&lt;ref name=&quot;MacCambridge, 2005, p. 42.&quot;&gt;MacCambridge, 2005, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MacCambridge, 2009, p. 1080.&quot;&gt;MacCambridge, 2009, p. 1080.&lt;/ref&gt; 10th seed in the east.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weyand, 1957, p. 126.&quot;&gt;Weyand, 1957, p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt; After Harvard, and then Yale, turned down an invitation to the [[1917 Rose Bowl]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Hibner, 1993, p. 22.&quot;&gt;Hibner, 1993, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Penn was offered an invitation and accepted it.&lt;ref name=&quot;King, 2005, p. 21.&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lyons, 2010, p. 9.&quot;&gt;Lyons, 2010, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; The Quakers were installed as 5-3 favorites over the [[Oregon Ducks]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hibner, 1993, p. 24.&quot;&gt;Hibner, 1993, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lyons, 2010, p. 9. BETTING LINE&quot;&gt;Lyons writes Penn was heavily favored. Lyons, 2010, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; The Rose Bowl sold out and more than 25,000 attended the game.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weyand, 1957, p. 126.&quot;/&gt; Penn's total offensive yards for the game was 230 vs 242 from Oregon,&lt;ref name=&quot;MacCambridge, 2009, p. 1440.&quot;&gt;MacCambridge, 2009, p. 1440.&lt;/ref&gt; but the largest gain from scrimmage by Penn was Bell's 20 yard gain.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lyons, 2010, p. 10.&quot;&gt;Lyons, 2010, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Bell was replaced at quarterback after throwing an interception, from the Quaker's fifteen yard line, in the fourth quarter that led to the final score, Oregon 14, Penn 0,&lt;ref name=&quot;Lyons, 2010, p. 10.&quot;&gt;Lyons, 2010, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; three plays later.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hibner, 1993, p. 27.&quot;&gt;Hibner, 1993, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1917 season, Bell led Penn to a 9-2-0 finish.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacCambridge, 2009, p. 1080.&quot;/&gt; On December 1, 1917, Bell was inducted into a Mobile Hospital Unit of the [[United States Army]] for [[World War I]]. Later that day, his teammates unanimously selected him to be team captain for the 1918 season.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lyons, 2010, p. 11.&quot;&gt;Lyons, 2010, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; However, after a few months of training, he was deployed to [[France]] and arrived in May 1918.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lyons, 2010, p. 12.&quot;&gt;Lyons, 2010, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Bell and some members of his unit volunteered for dangerous assignments. As a result of one occasion, his unit received a congratulatory letter for bravery from General [[John J. Pershing]]. He was promoted to top sergeant in France and returned home in March of 1919 with a discharge soon to be.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lyons, 2010, p. 13-15.&quot;&gt;Lyons, 2010, p. 13-15.&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to Penn as captain of the football team for the 1919 season and again played erratically.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lyons, 2010, p. 16-20.&quot;&gt;Lyons, 2010, p. 16-20.&lt;/ref&gt; The Quakers team finished 1919 with a 6-2-1 record.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacCambridge, 2009, p. 1080.&quot;/&gt; His collegiate playing days were over and he was viewed as having been an above-average player. However, Bell's aversion to attending academic classes caught up with him and in February 1920 he left Penn without a degree.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lyons, 2010, p. 20-21.&quot;&gt;Lyons, 2010, p. 20-21.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MacCambridge, 2005, p. 42. GRADUATE&quot;&gt;MacCambridge writes Bell graduated from Penn. MacCambridge, 2005, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early career===
Bell became a line coach for Penn's coach [[John Heisman]] from 1920 to 1922. Under Heisman, he became well regarded as an assistant coach. When Louis Young became coach in 1923, Bell stayed on as backfield coach. After Penn's declaration as collegiate champions in 1924, Bell and fellow assistant coach [[Lud Wray]] received some unnamed offers for head coaching positions, but both of them declined all offers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lyons, 2010, p. 22-23.&quot;&gt;Lyons, 2010, p. 22-23.&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, Bell and Wray had a falling out had a dispute over Quaker football strategy because Bell felt that Young and Wray overemphasized scrimmages in practices. Consequently, Bell tendered his resignation to Penn, which was not accepted, in November of 1928 and informed friends two months later he had no desire to seek a head coaching position because he felt it was too time-consuming. Bell preferred to stay on at Penn, but eventually, Bell's resignation was accepted prior to the start of the 1929 season.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lyons, 2010, p. 25-27.&quot;&gt;Lyons, 2010, p. 25-27.&lt;/ref&gt; Late in Bell's career at Penn, his father set Bert up with a job managing the Ritz Carlton Hotel.

His father bailed him of his losses and Bell continued to work, or returned to working at the Ritz for an unspecified length.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lyons, 2010, p. 30-32.&quot;&gt;Lyons, 2010, p. 30-32.&lt;/ref&gt;

===NFL commissioner===
&lt;!-- Hiring and first negotiation --&gt;
A sequence of events, beginning in 1941, led to Bell being hired as the NFL commissioner in 1946. When [[Elmer Layden]] was hired as NFL commissioner in 1941, [[Arch Ward]] was viewed as dictating the hiring of Layden.&lt;ref name=&quot;Littlewood, 1990, p. 133.&quot;&gt;Littlewood, 1990, p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; Some owners had been upset because they believed they were not given fair representation on who should become the commissioner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Littlewood, 1990, p. 133.&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lyons, 2010, p. 85-86.&quot;&gt;Lyons, 2010, p. 85-86.&lt;/ref&gt; In September, 1944, Ward organized a group of investors to create the AAFC for the purpose of competing against the NFL.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacCambridge, 2005, p. 13.&quot;&gt;MacCambridge, 2005, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Davis, 2005, p. 196-197.&quot;&gt;Davis, 2005, p. 196-197.&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout 1945, [[Dan Topping]], owner of the [[Brooklyn Dodgers (NFL)|Brooklyn Dodgers]], and Mara, had been feuding because Mara would not permit Topping to use [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]] as his home field, due to the stadium's proximity to the Giants home field, the [[Polo Grounds]]. Mara was invoking territorial rights to block Topping's move.&lt;ref name=&quot;Piascik, 2007, p. 52-54.&quot;&gt;Piascik, 2007, p. 52-54.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MacCambridge, 2005, p. 14.&quot;&gt;MacCambridge, 2005, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Peterson, 1997, p. 149.&quot;&gt;Peterson, 1997, p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt; (Territorial rights, originally put in the NFL constitution in 1921, was defined as no two teams were permitted to play in the ''same area'' on the same day.&lt;ref name=&quot;Willis, 2010, p. 135.&quot;&gt;Willis, 2010, p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt;) As a result of this feud and a total payment of $100,000 that the owners of AAFC teams agreed to give Topping, Topping took his Dodgers from the NFL to the AAFC.&lt;ref name=&quot;Littlewood, 1990, p. 161.&quot;&gt;Littlewood, 1990, p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Carroll, 1979, p. 527.&quot;&gt;The encyclopedia lists Topping being guaranteed $100,000 from each of the eight AAFC teams.

He then threatened to sell his team unless the transfer was permitted. Bell negotiated a settlement whereby the Rams would agree to pay visiting team $15,000 instead of the customary $10,000 and as a result, the Los Angeles Rams were created.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacCambridge, 2005, p. 15-16.&quot;&gt;MacCambridge, 2005, p. 15-16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Davis, 2005 p. 202.&quot;&gt;Davis writes that there was not much of a negotiation at all and Halas basically engineered the approval of Reeves move to Los Angeles, but mentions nothing of the terms of the negotiation.

Bell would stay on in his role as commissioner. Three AAFC teams (the [[Cleveland Browns]], the [[San Francisco 49ers]], and [[Baltimore Colts (1947–1950)|Baltimore Colts]]) would be incorporated into the NFL under the newly named National-American Football Conference.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lyons, 2010, p. 150.&quot;&gt;Lyons, 2010, p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MacCambridge, 2005, p. 52.&quot;&gt;MacCambridge, 2005, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; Later that month, his contract was changed again from a five-year to a 10-year pact at the same salary.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lyons, 2010, p. 147.&quot;&gt;Lyons, 2010, p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt; Within three months, the NFL would eschew its merged name and revert to being the NFL.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacCambridge, 2005, p. 52.&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lyons, 2010, p. 163.&quot;&gt;Lyons, 2010, p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt;

====NFL schedule====
&lt;!-- Need good subsection title --&gt;
The crafting of the NFL schedule had been a source of contention in the NFL since the [[1932 NFL season]]. [[Joe Carr]], the president of the NFL,{{citation needed|date=May 2011|reason=I do not think any of the ensuing page numbers includes him being president. Sentences need to be restructured to match citations}} had taken over the primary duty of scheduling the season beginning with the 1933 season&lt;ref name=&quot;Willis, 2010, p. 303, 308, 371, 383.&quot;&gt;Willis, 2010, p. 303, 308, 371, 383.&lt;/ref&gt; and his primary focus was to design the team schedules to benefit the large city teams.&lt;ref name=&quot;Yost, 2006, p. 61.&quot;&gt;Yost, 2006, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=May 2011}} But, scheduling reverted back to being decided on during an owners' meeting each year after his death. Each owner wanted to schedule opponents that would maximize their gate for the entire season Layden's general approach to disagreements between the owners was to not get involved and let the owners sort out their differences.&lt;ref name=&quot;Layden; Snyder, 1969, p. 148.&quot;&gt;Layden; Snyder, 1969, p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt; The difficulty in coming to an agreement over the NFL schedule convinced the owners to let Bell craft the schedule. Beginning with the 1948 NFL season,&lt;ref name=&quot;RUCK, p. 248.&quot;&gt;Ruck; Paterson and Weber, 2010, p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt; Bell unilaterally created scheduling for all the teams in the NFL until the start of the 1952 NFL season.{{citation required|date=May 2011}}&lt;ref name=&quot;MacCambridge, 2005, p. 40.&quot;&gt;MacCambridge writes Bell created the schedules for his entire stay as commissioner. MacCambridge, 2005, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; Bell created the schedules so, at the start of the season, the weaker teams would play against each other and the the stronger teams would play each other. Bell's goal was to augment game attendances by keeping the disparity in team standings to a minimal for as long as possible.&lt;ref name=&quot;RUCK, p. 248.&quot;/&gt;

====Television era====
&lt;!-- Need good subsection title --&gt;
The number of television sets in America was 100,000 in 1947.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coenen, 2005, p. 153.&quot;&gt;Coenen, 2005, p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MacCambridge, 2005, p. 68. TVs&quot;&gt;MacCambridge writes the number as 26,000, which could conflict with Coenen or the number could have been determined earlier in 1947. MacCambridge, 2005, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; As late as 1947, both the AAFC and the NFL let each franchise independently decide how to market its games on television. Revenue from radio broadcasts amounted to about 3% to 8% of revenue for all of professional football in the late 1940s and this amount was far outpaced the amount received from televising games.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coenen, 2005, p. 153.&quot;/&gt; &lt;!-- This has to be rewritten. This &quot;late 1940s&quot; STUFF IS BAD Papa Bear goes here --&gt;At the league meeting in January 1949, Bell informed the owners that the 1947 and 1948 attendance records had clearly shown that televising games locally had a negative impact on the sale of home tickets.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coenen, 2005, p. 154.&quot;&gt;Coenen, 2005, p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt; Bell negotiated the first television contract for the NFL in 1949,&lt;ref name=&quot;RUCK, p. 290.&quot;&gt;Ruck; Paterson and Weber, 2010, p. 290.&lt;/ref&gt; when [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] broadcast [[1949 NFL Championship Game|1949 championship game]] whereby $11,000 of the revenue for the broadcast went to the players participating in the game (none to any of the franchises in the NFL)&lt;ref name=&quot;Lyons, 2010, p. 156-157.&quot;&gt;Lyons, 2010, p. 156-157.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Coenen, 2005, p. 155-156.&quot;&gt;Coenen writes that the NFL received $20,000 for the 1948 championship game but does not explain what they did with it and who negotiated the contract. Furthermore, according to Lyons $11,000 of the money for 1949 game went to the players, but the actual remaining amount is not known nor is its distribution accounted for. Coenen, 2005, p. 155-156.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1950, 4 million TV million sets existed in America&lt;ref name=&quot;Peterson, 1997, p. 196.&quot;&gt;Peterson writes this meant 30 million (20% of the nation's population) had access to a TV. Peterson, 1997, p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt; and at some point in 1950 the number increased to 8 million TV sets with at least 20 million Americans having access to a set.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coenen, 2005, p. 153.&quot;/&gt; 

The [[Los Angeles Rams]] broadcast all of their 1950 regular season home games, for the first time, and their attendance dropped off by almost 50%. The only explanation was that televising home games was detrimental to attendance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Peterson, 1997, p. 197.&quot;&gt;Peterson, 1997, p. 197.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MacCambridge, 2005, p. 70.&quot;&gt;MacCambridge, 2005, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, at league meetings in January of 1951, Bell pushed through a motion that teams could still televise their home games if they and the visiting team both agreed to. Also, Bell's salary was increased to $40,000 a year for the remainder of his contract.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lyons, 2010, p. 173-174.&quot;&gt;Lyons, 2010, p. 173-174.&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[1951 NFL season|1951 season]], Bell gained control over the setting of television policy for all teams in the NFL.&lt;ref name=&quot;Peterson, 1997, p. 197.&quot;&gt;Peterson, 1997, p. 197.&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=May 2011|reason=Davis says Bell starting blacking out games in 1951. Need double check on 1950, 1951 or 1952 season. &quot;Davis, 2005, p. 270-271.&quot;}} Bell mandated that broadcasts would have to follow a strict rule of conduct which included not televising injuries, nor fights, TV announcers not being permitted to criticize the game,&lt;ref name=&quot;King, 2005, p. 37.&quot;&gt;King, 2005, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; and the would have to be approved by him.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lyons, 2010, p. 133.&quot;&gt;Lyons, 2010, p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; Bell explained his rationale by saying that announcers were 'salesman for professional football' and 'we are selling football' and 'we do not want kids believing that engaging in fights is 'the way to play football.'&lt;ref name=&quot;King, 2005, p. 37.&quot;/&gt; Bell was criticized frequently for censoring TV broadcasts, a charge he dismissed as not pertinent because he was advertising a product on TV and was not impeding the print media.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lyons, 2010, p. 282.&quot;&gt;Lyons, 2010, p. 282.&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1951, the [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Justice Department]] filed suit against the NFL over its blackout rules as a violation of the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]]. That month, Bell told the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', &quot;You can't give fans a game for free on TV and also expect them to go to the ballpark&quot;. Nevertheless, the suit was ordered to trial in January 1952.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coenen, 2005, p. 157-158.&quot;&gt;Coenen, 2005, p. 157-158.&lt;/ref&gt; In May of 1953, Bell negotiated a deal with [[DuMont Television Network]] granting them the rights to nationally broadcast one game a week. The revenue from this contract was split equally amongst all the teams and amounted to about $50,0000 for each team.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coenen, 2005, p. 158.&quot;&gt;Coenen writes the games were broadcast &quot;on Friday or Saturday nights, and on holidays&quot; but does not mention the contract was agreed to in May of 1953. Coenen, 2005, p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lyons, 2010, p. 196.&quot;&gt;Lyons, 2010, p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt; Later in November, the NFL won its case against the Justice Department with respect to the NFL's blackout policy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Peterson, 1997, p. 198.&quot;&gt;, 1997, p. 198.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lyons, 2010, p. 199-200.&quot;&gt;Lyons, 2010, p. 199-200.&lt;/ref&gt;

====NFLPA====
&lt;!-- need better title here --&gt;
Bill Radovich played for the Detroit Lions in 1945 and then left the NFL and played for the Los Angeles Dons in the AAFC.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carroll, 1979, p. 1197.&quot;&gt;Carroll, 1979, p. 1197.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lyons, 2010, p. 154.&quot;&gt;Lyons, 2010, p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Piascik, 2007, p. 27.&quot;&gt;Piascik, 2007, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; Bell, following a rule that was created in 1946{{citation needed|date=May 2011|reason=need double check if it was December 1945 or January 1946 Coenen on p. 182 says it was 1945.}} to counter the AAFC, banned Radovich from employment in the NFL for five years. After playing for the Dons for two seasons, Radovich was offered a job with the San Francisco Clippers, a team from the [[Pacific Coast Professional Football League|Pacific Coast League]] (PCL). The PCL was an NFL affiliated league. The Clippers was advised by the NFL that Radovich was blacklisted and it was warned by the NFL that if they hired Radovich, then they would suffer consequences. Radovich's offer was withdrawn by the Clippers. {{citation needed|date=May 2011|reason= I want to use primary source from Supreme Court filings because all the authors are really sloppy when explaining the findings of fact.

In the ensuing case, [[Radovich v. National Football League]], the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruled  in 1957 in favor of Radovich, and furthermore the court declared that the NFL was subject to antitrust laws.&lt;ref name=Coenen182&gt;Coenen, 2005, p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RUCK293&gt;Ruck; Paterson and Weber, 2010, p. 293.&lt;/ref&gt; The implications from the Court's ruling was that the legality of the draft and the NFL's [[Reserve clause|reserve clause]], which stipulated that a team may choose to automatically keep a player on their team for another year, at the same pay, after his contract had expired,&lt;ref name=RUCK293/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lyons, 2010, p. 176.&quot;&gt;Lyons, 2010, p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt; was questionable.&lt;ref name=Coenen182/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lyons, 2010, p. 255-256.&quot;&gt;Lyons, 2010, p. 255-256.&lt;/ref&gt;

Congress immediately scheduled hearings on the ramifications of the ruling. Bell pressed a case in the media for the NFL being legislatively granted an exemption from antitrust regulations. Bell explained to the media that the NFL was a sport and not a business.{{citation needed|date=May 2011|reason=delineate uncited statements}} Bell registered himself as a Congressional lobbyist.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lyons, 2010, p. 261.&quot;&gt;Lyons, 2010, p. 261.&lt;/ref&gt; He tried to persuade members of the Congress that the NFL needed an exemption. Representatives of the NFLPA appeared before Congress and explained that the draft and the reserve clause were anti-labor. At the time, a large portion of the constituents of Congress were in unions. Members of Congress were unmoved by Bell's arguments and it appeared as if the Congress were going to revoke the NFL's implementation of the draft. Faced with Congress becoming more intimately involved with the running of the NFL, Bell announced in hearings before Congress that he formally recognized the NFLPA.{{citation needed|date=May 2011|reason=I'm just adding content and I really do not like any of the source for this.

==Family life and death==
[[Broadway (theatre)|Broadway]] actress [[Frances Upton]], a devout [[Catholicism|Roman Catholic]], and Bell secretly married in January 4, 1934.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lyons, 2010, p. 33-38.&quot;&gt;They were ''officially'' married on May 6, 1934 at St. Madeleine Sophie Roman Catholic Church in Philadelphia.(Lyons, p. 41)  Lyons, 2010, p. 33-38.&lt;/ref&gt; They had three children,&lt;ref name=&quot;Death&quot;/&gt; sons Bert, Jr. (born February 19, 1936),&lt;ref name=&quot;Lyons, 2010, p. 60.&quot;&gt;Lyons, 2010, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Upton Bell|John &quot;Upton&quot;]], (born October 13, 1937),&lt;ref name=&quot;Lyons, 2010, p. 70.&quot;&gt;Lyons, 2010, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; and daughter Jane Upton (born February 1, 1942).&lt;ref name=&quot;Lyons, 2010, p. 92.&quot;&gt;Lyons, 2010, p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; Sometime after his father's death in 1935, Bell and his family moved into his father's estate in [[Radnor, Pennsylvania]] that had been bequeathed equally to Bert and his brother. Bell's desire to maintain ownership of the Eagles amidst its financial losses from 1936 to 1938 eventually led him to convince his brother to sell their father's estate sometime around 1938. Bell and his family moved into a hotel, which was either previously owned by his father or presently owned by his father's estate, in [[Center City, Philadelphia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lyons, 2010, p. 166.&quot;&gt;Lyons, 2010, p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt; The Bells then lived in various rental properties in Philadelphia and [[Narberth, Pennsylvania]] until sometime around the summer of 1950. They then moved into a home he bought in Narbeth, where he would live out the remainder of his life.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lyons, 2010, p. 167.&quot;&gt;Lyons, 2010, p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt; This transient lifestyle was due to financial necessity because Bell was not financially secure enough to afford a home.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lyons, 2010, p. 166.&quot;/&gt;

As part-owner or owner of an NFL team, Bell never had an African American player on any of his teams. His son, Bert, Jr., was adamant in his belief that his father was not a racist. He recounted an incident when [[Emlen Tunnell]]'s brother approached Bell inquiring about Emlen becoming an NFL player, and Bell subsequently calling the Giants on Tunnell's behalf&lt;ref name=&quot;Lyons, 2010, p. 142.&quot;/&gt;; consequently, Tunnell integrated the Giants before the start of the [[1948 NFL season]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Pervin, 2009, p. 17.&quot;&gt;Pervin, 2009, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ross, 1999, p. 111.&quot;&gt;Tunnell was the first African American in the history of the New York Giants. p. 166 Ross, 1999, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; The death of Tim Mara in February 1959 unsettled Bell, who suffered a heart attack that month.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lyons, 2010, p. 308.&quot;&gt;Lyons, 2010, p. 308.&lt;/ref&gt; Bell converted to Catholicism in the summer of 1959 partly because of the lifelong urging of his wife,&lt;ref name=&quot;Lyons, 2010, p. 142.&quot;/&gt; Mara's death, and his enduring friendship with Rooney,&lt;ref name=&quot;RUCK, p. 311.&quot;&gt;Ruck; Paterson and Weber, 2010, p. 311.&lt;/ref&gt; a practicing Catholic.&lt;ref name=&quot;ROONEY, 2007, p. 26.&quot;&gt;Rooney; Halaas and Masich, 2007, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rooney; Halaas and Masich, 2007, p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; Before his passing, Bell had told his son, Bert Jr., that he thought the best man qualified to replace him was [[Paul Brown]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MacCambridge, 2005, p. 107.&quot;&gt;MacCambridge, 2005, p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Pete Rozelle was eventually elected as the third NFL commissioner.

'''Robert Quinlan''' &quot;'''Bob'''&quot; '''Costas''' (born March 22, 1952) is an American [[sportscaster]], on the air for the [[NBC]] network since the early 1980s.

==Early life==
Bob Costas was born in Queens, New York. He is the son of Jayne ([[married and maiden names|née]] Quinlan) of [[Irish American]] descent and John George Costas of [[Greek American]] descent, who was an electrical engineer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filmreference.com/film/66/Bob-Costas.html Bob Costas Biography (1952–)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In Ken Burns' [[Baseball|Baseball (TV Series)]], Costas indicated that he had a very poor relationship with his father, but did not go into specifics. He grew up in [[Commack, New York]], graduating from [[Commack School District|Commack High School South]]. Following high school, he majored in Communications &amp; Rhetorical Studies at [[Syracuse University]] where he dropped out of school. Later he received an honorary degree from S. I. Newhouse School of Communications.

==Broadcasting career==
===Early career===
His sportscasting career started while attending Syracuse University, as an announcer for the [[Syracuse Blazers]] minor-league hockey team playing in the [[Eastern Hockey League]] and [[North American Hockey League]].

Costas' career as a professional began at [[KMOX (AM)|KMOX radio]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], where he served as a play-by-play announcer for the [[Spirits of St. Louis]] of the [[American Basketball Association]]. He also called [[Missouri Tigers men's basketball|Missouri Tigers]] basketball for KMOX, and co-hosted the station's ''Open Line'' call-in program.

Costas was a prominent contributor to the ABA book ''[[Loose Balls: The Short, Wild Life of the American Basketball Association]]''. He is extensively quoted on many topics, and the book includes his reflections of ABA life during his tenure as radio voice of the Spirits of St. Louis.

Costas later did play-by-play for [[Chicago Bulls]] broadcasts on [[WGN-TV]] during the [[1979-80 NBA season|1979–1980 season]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fuzzymemories.tv/screen.php?c=786&amp;m=xxwgnxx&amp;p=2 fuzzymemories.tv]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fuzzymemories.tv/screen.php?c=1093&amp;m=xxwgnxx&amp;p=1 fuzzymemories.tv]&lt;/ref&gt; He was briefly employed by the [[CBS]] network prior to joining NBC Sports in 1980.

===NBC Sports===
When Costas was first hired by NBC, [[Don Ohlmeyer]], who at the time ran [[NBC Sports]], told the then 28-year-old Costas that he looked like a 14-year-old. Ohlmeyer presumably based his reaction on Costas' modest stature (Costas is 5' 7&quot; in height) and boyish, babyfaced appearance.

He has been an in-studio host of [[National Football League]] coverage and [[play-by-play]] man for the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] and for [[Major League Baseball]]. Costas has teamed with [[Isiah Thomas]] and [[Doug Collins]] for [[NBA on NBC|basketball telecasts]] (from [[1997-98 NBA season|1997]]–[[1999-2000 NBA season|2000]]) and [[Tony Kubek]] (from [[1983 in baseball|1983]]–[[1989 in baseball|1989]]), [[Joe Morgan]] and [[Bob Uecker]] (from [[1994 in baseball|1994]]–[[2000 in baseball|2000]]) for [[Major League Baseball on NBC|baseball telecasts]]. Before becoming the studio host for ''[[NFL on NBC|The NFL on NBC]]'' in [[1984 NFL season|1984]], Costas did play-by-play with analyst [[Bob Trumpy]] for NFL games.

Since 2001, he has been the co-host of the Kentucky Derby. Since 1995, Costas has also hosted NBC's coverage of the U.S. Open Golf Tournament.

In 2009, he hosted [[Bravo (US TV network)|Bravo's]] coverage of the 2009 [[Kentucky Oaks]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nt2099.com/J-ENT/news/american-entertainment/ladies-first-bravo-at-the-kentucky-derby-airs-on-bravo-friday-may-1-at-5-pm-etpt/]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Olympics====
Costas has frontlined many Olympics broadcasts for [[Olympics on NBC|NBC]]. They include the Olympics in [[1992 Summer Olympics|Barcelona in 1992]], [[1996 Summer Olympics|Atlanta in 1996]], [[2000 Summer Olympics|Sydney in 2000]], [[2002 Winter Olympics|Salt Lake City in 2002]], [[2004 Summer Olympics|Athens in 2004]], [[2006 Winter Olympics|Torino in 2006]], [[2008 Summer Olympics|Beijing in 2008]], and [[2010 Winter Olympics|Vancouver in 2010]]. He discusses his work on the Olympic telecasts extensively in a book by Andrew Billings entitled ''Olympic Media: Inside the Biggest Show on Television''. A personal influence on Costas has been legendary [[ESPN on ABC|ABC Sports]] broadcaster [[Jim McKay]], who hosted many Olympics for [[Olympics on ABC|ABC]] from the 1960s to the 1980s.

During the 1992 Barcelona and 1996 Atlanta Opening Ceremonies, Costas' remarks on the China Team's possible drug use caused an uproar among the American Chinese and international communities. Thousands of dollars were raised to purchase ads in the ''[[Washington Post]]'' and Sunday ''[[New York Times]]'', featuring an image of the head of a statue of Apollo and reading: &quot;Costas Poisoned Olympic Spirit, Public Protests NBC.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://museums.cnd.org/CND-Global/CND-Global.96.3rd/CND-Global.96-08-31.html | title=Text of Protest Ad| publisher=''China News Digest'' |first=K. Harrison|last=Liang | date=1996-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C07E6D6163BF935A3575AC0A960958260| title=Cultural Views: Differing Outlooks | publisher=''New York Times'' | first=Richard|last=Sandomir | date=1996-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Costas' comments were made subsequent to the suspension of Chinese coach [[Zhou Ming]] after seven of his swimmers were caught using steroids in 1994. Further evidence of Chinese athletes' drug use came in 1997 when Australian authorities confiscated 13 vials of [[Somatropin]], a human growth hormone, from the bag of Chinese swimmer [[Yuan Yuan (swimmer)|Yuan Yuan]] upon her arrival for the [[1997 World Swimming Championships]]. At the World Championships, four Chinese swimmers tested positive for the banned substance [[Triamterene]], a diuretic used to dilute urine samples in order to mask the presence of anabolic steroids. Including these failed drug tests, 27 Chinese swimmers were caught using performance enhancing drugs from 1990 through 1997; more than the rest of the world combined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/jan/18/sports/sp-9735 | title=Latest Drug Scandal Has China Critics Seeing Red'' |first=Mike|last=Penner | date=1998-01-18 | work=The Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Major League Baseball====
One of Bob Costas' most memorable broadcasts occurred on June 23, 1984 (in what would go down in baseball lore as '''''[[The Sandberg Game]]'''''). Costas, along with Tony Kubek, was calling the Saturday baseball ''[[Major League Baseball on NBC|Game of the Week]]'' from Chicago's [[Wrigley Field]]. The game between the [[1984 Chicago Cubs season|Chicago Cubs]] and [[1984 St. Louis Cardinals season|St. Louis Cardinals]] in particular was cited for putting [[Ryne Sandberg]] (as well as the [[1984 Chicago Cubs season|1984 Cubs]] in general, who would go on to make their first postseason appearance since [[1945 in baseball|1945]]) &quot;on the map.&quot; In the ninth inning, the Cubs trailed 9–8, and faced the premier relief pitcher of the time, [[Bruce Sutter]]. Sandberg, then not known for his power, slugged a home run to left field against the Cardinals' ace closer. Despite this dramatic act, the Cardinals scored two runs in the top of the tenth. Sandberg came up again in the tenth inning, facing a determined Sutter with one man on base. Sandberg then shocked the national audience by hitting a second home run, even farther into the left field bleachers, to tie the game again. The Cubs went on to win in the 11th inning. Costas said when Sandberg hit that second home run, ''&quot;Do you believe it?!&quot;'' Willie McGee hit for the cycle in the same game.

While broadcasting Game 4 of the [[1988 World Series]] between the [[1988 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Los Angeles Dodgers]] and [[1988 Oakland Athletics season|Oakland Athletics]] on [[NBC]], Costas angered many members of the Dodgers (especially the team's manager, [[Tommy Lasorda]]) by commenting that the team quite possibly had the weakest-hitting lineup in World Series history. Later (while being interviewed by NBC's [[Marv Albert]]), after the Dodgers had won Game 4 (en route to a 4–1 series victory), Lasorda sarcastically suggested that the MVP of the 1988 World Series should be Bob Costas.

Besides calling the [[1989 American League Championship Series]] for NBC, Costas also filled-in for a suddenly ill [[Vin Scully]], who had come down with [[laryngitis]], for Game 2 of the [[1989 National League Championship Series]]. Game 2 of the NLCS occurred on Thursday, October 5, which was an off day for the ALCS. NBC then decided to fly Costas from Toronto to Chicago to substitute for Scully on Thursday night. Afterwards, Costas flew back to Toronto, where he resumed work on the ALCS the next night.

Bob Costas anchored NBC's pre and post-game for NFL broadcasts and the pre and post-game shows for numerous World Series and [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game]]s during the 1980s (the first being for the [[1982 World Series]]). Costas didn't get a shot at doing play-by-play (as the games on NBC were previously called by [[Vin Scully]]) for an All-Star Game until [[1994 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1994]] and a World Series until [[1995 World Series|1995]] (when NBC split the coverage with [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] under &quot;[[The Baseball Network]]&quot; umbrella). It wasn't until [[1997 World Series|1997]] when Costas finally got the chance to do play-by-play for a World Series from start to finish. Costas ended up winning a [[Sports Emmy Award]] for [[Outstanding Sports Personality, Play-by-Play]].

In [[1999 in baseball|1999]], Costas teamed with his then-[[Major League Baseball on NBC|NBC]] colleague, [[Joe Morgan]] to call two weekday night telecasts for [[ESPN Major League Baseball|ESPN]]. The first was on [[Wednesday Night Baseball|Wednesday]], August 25 with [[1999 Detroit Tigers season|Detroit Tigers]] playing against the [[1999 Seattle Mariners season|Seattle Mariners]]. The second was on Tuesday, September 21 with the [[1999 Atlanta Braves season|Atlanta Braves]] playing against the [[1999 New York Mets season|New York Mets]].

====National Basketball Association====
When NBC gained the NBA network contract from [[NBA on CBS|CBS]] in [[1990–91 NBA season|1990]], Costas hosted the telecasts and was teamed in the studio with ex-[[Los Angeles Lakers|Lakers]] coach [[Pat Riley]]. He also hosted the studio program ''[[NBA Showtime|Showtime]]'' and did play-by-play for the [[1991 NBA All-Star Game|1991 All-Star Game]]. In [[1997-98 NBA season|1997]], Costas began a three year stint as the lead play-by-play man for ''[[NBA on NBC|The NBA on NBC]]''. NBC enlisted Costas' services after they were forced to (temporarily) remove [[Marv Albert]] from their broadcasts due to lingering personal and legal problems at the time. Costas stepped aside following the [[2000 NBA Finals]], in favor of a returning Marv Albert.

While this, in essence, ended his active role on the ''NBA on NBC'' program (by this point, [[Hannah Storm]] and briefly [[Ahmad Rashad]] had replaced Costas on studio anchoring duties), Costas would return to do play-by-play for selected playoff games. Costas also anchored NBC's NBA Finals coverage in [[2002 NBA Finals|2002]], which was their last to date as [[Hannah Storm]] also anchored it with Costas.

====National Football League====
In [[2006 NFL season|2006]], Costas returned to studio hosting duties on ''[[The NFL on NBC Pregame Show|The NFL on NBC]]'' (under the ''[[Football Night in America]]'' banner), which was returning after a near ten year hiatus. Costas last hosted NFL telecasts for NBC in [[1992 NFL season|1992]].

Costas is nicknamed &quot;Rapping Roberto&quot; by ''[[New York Daily News]]'' sports media columnist Bob Raissman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/story/451507p-380022c.html | title=NBC out-Foxed in opener | publisher=''New York Daily News'' | author=Bob Raissman | date=2006-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Al Michaels]] also called him &quot;Rapping Roberto&quot; during the telecast between the [[2006 Indianapolis Colts season|Indianapolis Colts]] and the [[2006 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] on September 10, 2006, in response to Costas calling him &quot;Alfalfa.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/columnist/hiestand-tv/2006-09-10-weekend_x.htm | title=Scores, injury updates early fodder for NBC's Sunday-night NFL show | publisher=''USA Today'' | author=Michael Hiestand | date=2006-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====National Hockey League====
Costas hosted NBC's coverage of the [[2008 NHL Winter Classic|2008]], [[2009 NHL Winter Classic|2009]] and the [[2010 NHL Winter Classic]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[http://www.nhl.com/nhl/app/?service=page&amp;page=NewsPage&amp;articleid=346955 NHL.com – 2008 NHL Winter Classic&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; He was scheduled to host coverage of the [[2011 NHL Winter Classic|2011]] event as well, however due to the game's postponement Costas only hosted pre-game coverage before leaving to go to Seattle for his duties with NBC's NFL coverage the next night.

===Talk show hosting===
Costas also hosted the syndicated [[radio]] program ''[[Costas Coast to Coast]]'' from 1986–1996, which was later revived as ''[[Costas on the Radio]]''. ''Costas on the Radio'', which ended its three year run on May 31, 2009, aired on 200 stations nationwide each weekend and syndicated by the [[Clear Channel]] owned [[Premiere Radio Networks]]. Like ''Later'', Costas' radio shows have focused on a wide variety of topics, and have not been limited to sports discussion.

Costas hosted ''[[Later (talk show)|Later with Bob Costas]]'' on NBC from 1988 until 1994. This late night show created by [[Dick Ebersol]], coming on at 1:30 a.m. as the third program in NBC's nightly lineup after ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'' and [[Late Night with David Letterman|''Late Night With David Letterman'']], was something of a break from the typical TV talk show format of the era, featuring Costas and a single guest having a conversation for the entire half hour, without a band, opening monologue or studio audience. On several occasions, Costas held the guest over for multiple nights, and these in-depth discussions won Costas much praise for his interviewing skills. The show was taped in [[GE Building]]'s studio 8H at the [[Rockefeller Plaza]] with Costas interviewing the guest for 45 minutes to an hour before turning the material over to editors who condensed it down to 22 minutes plus commercial breaks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmyB934SsDI Later 1994]&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2005, Costas was named by [[CNN]] president, [[Jonathan Klein (CNN)|Jonathan Klein]], as a regular substitute anchor for [[Larry King]]'s ''[[Larry King Live]]'' for one year. Costas, as well as Klein, have said that Costas was not trying out for King's position on a permanent basis. [[Nancy Grace]] was also named a regular substitute host for the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/06/09/entertainment/main700753.shtml | title=CNN hires Bob Costas | publisher=''Associated Press'' | date=2005-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 18, 2005, Costas refused to host a ''Larry King Live'' broadcast where the subject was missing teenager [[Natalee Holloway]]. Costas said he had no hard feelings about the subject, but that he was uncomfortable with it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.firstcoastnews.com/news/usworld/news-article.aspx?storyid=42748 | title=Bob Costas refuses to anchor Holloway coverage | publisher=''Associated Press'' | date=2005-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===HBO Sports===
In 2001, Costas was hired by [[HBO]] to host a 12 week series called ''[[On the Record with Bob Costas]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0283207/ IMDb - &quot;On the Record with Bob Costas&quot; (2001)]&lt;/ref&gt; ''On the Record with Bob Costas'' was similar to the format of the old ''Later'' program as they both concentrated on in-depth interviews.

In 2002, Costas began a stint as co-host of HBO's long running series ''[[Inside the NFL]]''. Costas remained host of ''Inside the NFL'' through the end of the [[2007 NFL season]]. He hosted the show with [[Cris Collinsworth]] and former NFL legends [[Dan Marino]] and [[Cris Carter]]. The program aired each week during the NFL season.

In 2005, ''On the Record with Bob Costas'' was revamped to become ''[[Costas Now]]'', a monthly show that would focus more on sports and air year-round in a 9 p.m. ET/PT time slot. ''Costas Now'' was more akin to HBO's ''[[Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel]]''.

Costas left HBO to sign with [[MLB Network]] in February 2009.

===MLB Network===
Costas agreed to become a contributor to [[MLB Network]]. At the channel's launch on January 1, 2009, he hosted the premiere episode of ''All Time Games'', a presentation of the recently-discovered [[kinescope]] of Game 5 of the [[1956 World Series]]. During the episode, he held a forum with [[Don Larsen]], who pitched MLB's only postseason [[perfect game]] during that game, and [[Yogi Berra]], who caught the game.

Costas joined the network full-time on February 3, 2009. He hosts a regular interview show titled ''MLB Network Studio 42 with Bob Costas'' as well as special programming, and provides play-by-play for select live ''[[Thursday Night Baseball]]'' games.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mlb.mlb.com/news/press_releases/press_release.jsp?ymd=20090203&amp;content_id=3793902&amp;vkey=pr_mlb&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=mlb&amp;partnerId=rss_mlb Bob Costas Joins MLB Network]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other appearances===
Costas provided significant contributions to the [[Ken Burns]], [[PBS]] mini series ''[[Baseball (TV series)|Baseball]]'' as well as its follow-up ''[[Baseball (TV series)|The 10th Inning]]''. He also appears in another PBS film, ''[[A Time for Champions]]'', produced by [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis']] [[KETC|Nine Network of Public Media]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.timeforchampions.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interests==
===Love of baseball===
Costas is a devoted baseball fan (he's been suggested as a potential [[Baseball Commissioner|commissioner]]) and wrote ''Fair Ball: A Fan's Case for Baseball'' in [[2000 in literature|2000]]. For his 40th birthday, then [[Oakland Athletics]] manager [[Tony La Russa]] allowed Costas to manage the club during a spring training game. The first time Costas visited baseball legend [[Stan Musial]]'s St. Louis eatery, he left a [[United States dollar|$]]3.31 tip in homage to Musial's lifetime batting average (.331). Costas delivered the [[eulogy]] at [[Mickey Mantle]]'s [[funeral]]. In eulogizing Mantle, Costas described the baseball legend as ''&quot;a fragile hero to whom we had an emotional attachment so strong and lasting that it defied logic.&quot;'' Costas has even carried a [[1958 in baseball|1958]] Mickey Mantle [[baseball card]] in his wallet.

Costas has been fairly outspoken about his disdain for Major League Baseball instituting a [[Wild card (sports)#Major League Baseball|wild card]]. Costas believes that it diminishes the significance of winning a divisional championship. He prefers a system in which winning the wild card puts a team at some sort of disadvantage, as opposed to on an equal level with teams by which they were outplayed over a 162 game season. Or, as explained in his book ''Fair Ball'', have only the three division winners in each league go to the postseason, with the team with the best record receiving a bye into the League Championship Series. Once, on the air on [[HBO]]'s ''[[Inside the NFL]]'', he mentioned that the NFL regular season counted for something, but baseball's was beginning to lose significance.

Costas serves as a member of the advisory board of the [[Baseball Assistance Team]], a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization dedicated to helping former Major League, Minor League, and Negro League players through financial and medical difficulties.

===Political views===
Costas declared on June 27, 2007, that the presidency of [[George W. Bush]] had &quot;tragically failed.&quot;
&lt;blockquote&gt;''Some people may wonder about the [political] feelings that I've expressed, and I won't get into all the particulars. I think it is now overwhelmingly evident, if you're honest about it, even if you're a conservative Republican, if you're honest about it, this is a failed administration. And no honest conservative would say that George W. Bush was among the 500 most qualified people to be President of the United States. That's not based on political leaning. If a liberal, and I tend to be liberal, disagrees with a conservative, they can still respect that person's competence and the integrity of their point of view. This administration can be rightly criticized by a fair-minded person smack in the middle of the political spectrum on a hundred different counts, and by now they're all self-evident.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsbusters.org/node/13253 Bob Costas: 'Inescapable Fact' That Bush Presidency 'A Tragically Failed Administration' NewsBusters.org]
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The following summer, Costas would interview Bush, as he made an appearance during the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] in Beijing.&lt;ref name=&quot;ostrow2008&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Ostrow|first=Joanne|title=Bob Costas, redeemed |url=http://blogs.denverpost.com/ostrow/2008/08/10/bob-costas-redeemed/215/|work=Ostrow Off the Record Blog, Denver Post|accessdate=29 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Costas was married from 1983 to 2001 to Carole &quot;Randy&quot; Randall Krummenacher. They had two children, son Keith (born 1986) and daughter Taylor (born 1989). Costas once jokingly promised [[Minnesota Twins]] center fielder [[Kirby Puckett]] that if he was batting over .350 by the time his child was born he would name the baby Kirby. Kirby was hitting better than .350, but Bob's son initially was not given a first (or second) name of Kirby. After Puckett reminded Costas of the agreement, the birth certificate was changed to &quot;Keith Michael Kirby Costas&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1003993/index.htm | work=CNN | title=Video | date=July 22, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 12, 2004, Costas married his second wife, Jill Sutton. Costas resides in [[St. Louis, Missouri]].

==Awards and honors==
Bob Costas has won multiple National Sportcaster of the Year awards from the National Sportcasters and Sportswriters Association and the [[American Sportscasters Association]] (1989, '91, '92 and '93), and nearly 20 [[Sports Emmy Awards|Emmy]] Awards for outstanding sports announcing. In 1999, Costas was a recipient of the [[Curt Gowdy Award]], which is awarded to members of the electronic and print media for outstanding contributions to baseball. He is also an honorary board member of the [[Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation]]

He was selected as the [[Dick Schaap Award for Outstanding Journalism]] recipient in 2004.

In 2006, Costas was also awarded an honorary doctorate in humane letters from [[Loyola College in Maryland]].

He is a Honorary Trustee of [[Webster University]], a private college located in the [[St. Louis]] suburb of Webster Groves. He is a frequent supporter of the school, to include numerous radio commercials

In a supposed effort to fulfill a deal he made on ''[[The Late Late Show (CBS)|The Late Late Show]]'' with [[Craig Kilborn]], as coverage of a game resumed he sipped a glass of pink lemonade and said ''&quot;Ah, that's restaurant quality lemonade.&quot;''

Costas has been alluded to in popular music. Arguably his most honorable accomplishment was having his named mentioned in the Mac Dre song &quot;Mafioso&quot;-&quot;Got game like Bob Costas.&quot; Costas was &quot;name checked&quot; in a [[Ludacris]] song after he mentioned the rapper on the late night talk show ''[[Last Call with Carson Daly]]''.

He guest-voiced as himself in ''[[The Simpsons]]'' 2010 episode, &quot;[[Boy Meets Curl]]&quot;, when Homer and Marge make the U.S. Olympic curling team.

'''Bamberg''' is a city in [[Bavaria]], [[Germany]]. It is located in [[Upper Franconia]] on the river [[Regnitz]], close to its confluence with the river [[Main (river)|Main]]. Bamberg is one of the few cities in Germany that was not destroyed by World War II bombings because of a nearby Artillery Factory that prevented planes from getting near to Bamberg. Bamberg is home to nearly 7,000 foreign nationals, including over 4,100 members of the [[United States Army]] and their dependents. The name ''Bamberg'' is supposed to have its origin in the [[House of Babenberg]].

== History ==
During the post-[[Roman Empire|Roman]] centuries of Germanic migration and settlement, the region afterwards included in the [[Diocese of Bamberg]] was inhabited for the most part by [[Slavs]]. The town, first mentioned in 902, grew up by the castle (Babenberch) which gave its name to the [[Babenberg]] family. On their extinction it passed to the [[Saxony|Saxon]] house. The area was Christianized chiefly by the monks of the [[Rule of St. Benedict|Benedictine]] [[Fulda Abbey]], and the land was under the spiritual authority of the [[Diocese of Würzburg]].

In 1007, [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry II]] made Bamberg a family inheritance, the seat of a separate [[diocese]]. The emperor's purpose in this was to make the Diocese of Würzburg less unwieldy in size and to give Christianity a firmer footing in the districts of [[Franconia]], east of Bamberg. In 1008, after long negotiations with the Bishops of Würzburg and [[Diocese of Eichstätt|Eichstätt]], who were to cede portions of their dioceses, the boundaries of the new diocese were defined, and [[Pope John XVIII]] granted the papal confirmation in the same year. Henry II ordered the building of a new [[Bamberg Cathedral|cathedral]], which was consecrated May 6, 1012. The church was enriched with gifts from the [[pope]], and Henry II had it dedicated in honor of him. In 1017 Henry II also founded [[Michaelsberg Abbey, Bamberg|Michaelsberg Abbey]] on the ''Michaelsberg'' (&quot;Mount St. Michael&quot;), near Bamberg, a Benedictine abbey for the training of the clergy. The emperor and his wife [[Cunigunde of Luxemburg|Cunigunde]] gave large temporal possessions to the new diocese, and it received many privileges out of which grew the secular power of the bishop. Pope Benedict VIII during his visit to Bamberg (1020) placed the diocese in direct dependence on the [[Holy See]]. For a short time Bamberg was the centre of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Henry and Cunigunde were both buried in the cathedral.

From the middle of the 13th century onward the [[bishop]]s were princes of the Empire and ruled Bamberg, overseeing the construction of monumental buildings. In 1248 and 1260 the see obtained large portions of the estates of the [[Duke of Merania|Counts of Meran]], partly through purchase and partly through the appropriation of extinguished fiefs. The old [[Bishopric of Bamberg]] was composed of an unbroken territory extending from [[Schlüsselfeld]] in a northeasterly direction to the [[Franconian Forest]], and possessed in addition estates in the Duchies of [[Duchy of Carinthia|Carinthia]] and [[Salzburg]], in the [[Nordgau]] (the present [[Upper Palatinate]]), in [[Thuringia]], and on the [[Danube]]. By the changes resulting from the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], the territory of this see was reduced nearly one half in extent.

The [[Bamberg witch trials|witch trials]] of the 17th century claimed hundreds of victims, as they did in England, in Bamberg and reached a climax between 1626 and 1631 under the rule of [[Prince-Bishop]] Johann Georg II Fuchs von Dornheim. The famous Drudenhaus (witch prison), built in 1627, is no longer standing today; however, detailed accounts of some cases, like that of [[Johannes Junius]], remain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://history.hanover.edu/texts/bamberg.html |title=The Witch Persecution at Bamberg |accessdate=2007-08-26 |quote=On Wednesday, June 28, 1628, was examined without torture Johannes Junius, Burgomaster at Bamberg, on the charge of witch-craft: how and in what fashion he had fallen into that vice.

In 1647, the [[University of Bamberg]] was founded as ''Academia Bambergensis''. [[Bambrzy]] (Ger. ''Posen Bambergers'') – German Poles are descendants of settlers from the area near Bamberg, who settled in villages around Posen in the years 1719–1753. In 1759, the possessions and jurisdictions of the diocese situated in [[Austria]] were sold to that state. When the secularization of church lands took place (1802) the diocese covered {{convert|3305|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} and had a population of 207,000. Bamberg thus lost its independence in 1802, becoming part of Bavaria in 1803.

Bamberg was first connected to the German rail system in 1844, which has been an important part of its infrastructure ever since. After a communist uprising took control over Bavaria in the years following [[World War I]], the state government fled to Bamberg and stayed there for almost two years before the Bavarian capital of [[Munich]] was retaken by ''[[Freikorps]]'' units (see [[Bavarian Soviet Republic]]). The first republican constitution of Bavaria was passed in Bamberg, becoming known as the [http://www.verfassungen.de/de/by/bayern19-index.htm ''Bamberger Verfassung''] (Bamberg Constitution).

In February 1926 Bamberg served as the venue for the famous [[Bamberg Conference]], convened by [[Adolf Hitler]] in his attempt to foster unity and to stifle dissent within the young [[NSDAP]]. Bamberg was chosen for its location in Upper Franconia, reasonably close to the residences of the members of the dissident northern Nazi faction but still within Bavaria.&lt;ref&gt;''See generally'' {{cite book |last=Kershaw|first=Ian|isbn = 0-393-04671-0  |author-link=Ian Kershaw|title= Hitler 1889–1936: Hubris|location=New York|publisher= W.

In 1973, the town celebrated the 1000th anniversary of its founding.

=== Beer ===
Bamberg is known for its smoked ''[[Rauchbier]]''. The most famous is ''[[Schlenkerla]]'s'' ''Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier'' from the ''Heller'' brewery; it can be enjoyed  at the Schlenkerla tavern on the Dominikaner Strasse in the Old Town.

Bamberg is home to eight breweries, Brauerei Fässla, Brauerei Greifenklau, Brauerei Heller-Trum (Schlenkerla), Brauerei Kaiserdom, Keesmann Bräu, Klosterbräu, Mahrs Bräu and Brauerei Spezial, and one [[brewpub]], Ambräusianum&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ratebeer.com/Place/germany/bamberg/ambr%C3%A4usianum/5908.htm Ambräusianum, Bamberg&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;—an unusually high number for a city of 70,000.

== Geography ==
Bamberg is located in [[Franconia]], {{convert|63|km|mi|abbr=on}} north of [[Nuremberg]] by railway and {{convert|101|km|mi|abbr=on}} east of [[Würzburg]], also by rail. It is situated on the Regnitz river, {{convert|3|km|mi|abbr=on}} before it flows into the [[Main (river)|Main]] river.

Its geography is shaped by the Regnitz and by the foothills of the [[Steigerwald]], part of the German uplands. From northeast to southwest, the town is divided into first the Regnitz plain, then one large and several small islands formed by two arms of the Regnitz (''Inselstadt''), and finally the part of town on the hills, the &quot;Hill Town&quot; (''Bergstadt'').

Bamberg extends over seven hills, each crowned by a beautiful church. This has led to Bamberg being called the &quot;Franconian Rome&quot; — although a running joke among Bamberg's tour guides is to refer to Rome instead as the &quot;Italian Bamberg&quot;.

===The seven hills of Bamberg===
Bamberg prides itself with being on  seven hills, as it symbolises similarity to rome.
* Cathedral Hill - Domberg is the oldest settled hill and the episcopal centre with the cathedral (Bamberger Dom) and the old and new residence.
* Michaelsberg - [[Michaelsberg Abbey, Bamberg|St. Michaelsberg Abbey]] is a former [[Benedictine]] abbey, founded in 1015. As the monks were the first to brew beer, the Franconia Brewery Museum is now established in the old brewery.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}
* Kaulberg/Obere Pfarre - Liebfrauenkirche and the Karmelitenkirche are the two churches here.
* Stefansberg - Stefanskirche is the main Protestant church in Bamberg.
* Jakobsberg - Jakobskirche is the second oldest church, built in [[Romanesque architecture]] style. It is a stopping point along the &quot;[[Way of St. James]]&quot;.
* Altenburger Hill - Altenburger Berg (386m) is the highest of Bamberg's hills. [[Altenburg (Bamberg)|Altenburg castle]] was the residence of bishops during the 14th and 15th century.
* Abtsberg - in former times the Abtsberg belonged to the abbot of St. Michelsberg abbey, hence its name.

== Sights ==

The Old Town of Bamberg is listed as a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Sites|World Heritage]], primarily because of its authentic medieval appearance. The city established a documentation centre in 2005 to support World Heritage activities.
Some of the main sights are:
* Cathedral (1237), with the tombs of emperor Henry II and [[Pope Clement II]]
* ''Alte Hofhaltung'', residence of the bishops in the 16th and 17th centuries
* ''Neue Residenz'', residence of the bishops after the 17th century
* Old Town Hall (1386), built in the middle of the Regnitz River, accessible by two bridges
* ''Klein-Venedig'' (&quot;Little Venice&quot;), a colony of picturesque fishermen's houses from the 19th century along one side of the river Regnitz.
* Michaelsberg Abbey, built in the 12th century on one of Bamberg's &quot;Seven Hills&quot;
* [[Altenburg (Bamberg)|Altenburg]], castle, former residence of the bishops

'''Cathedral'''
[[Image:Bamberger Reiter BW 2.JPG|thumb|250px|The ''Bamberger Reiter''.]]
The [[cathedral]] is a late [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] building with four grand towers. It was founded in 1004 by the emperor Henry II, finished in 1012 and consecrated on May 6, 1012. It was later partially destroyed by fire in 1081. The new cathedral, built by Saint [[Otto of Bamberg]], was consecrated in 1111 and in the 13th century received its present late-Romanesque form.

The cathedral is {{convert|94|m|ft|abbr=on}} long, {{convert|28|m|ft|abbr=on}} broad, {{convert|26|m|ft|abbr=on}} high, and the four towers are each about {{convert|81|m|ft|abbr=on}} high. Of its many historic works of art may be mentioned the magnificent marble tomb of the founder and his wife, considered the masterpiece of the sculptor [[Tilman Riemenschneider]], and carved between 1499 and 1513. Another treasure of the cathedral is an [[equestrian statue]] known as the [[Bamberg Horseman]] ({{lang-de|Der Bamberger Reiter}}). This statue, possibly belonging to the emperor [[Conrad III of Germany|Conrad III]], most likely dates to approximately 1200. The statue also serves as a symbol of the city.

'''Neue Residenz'''

The ''Neue Residenz'' (New Palace) (1698–1704) was initially occupied by the prince-bishops, and from 1864 to 1867 by the deposed King [[Otto of Greece]]. The magnificent ''Rosengarten'' (Rose Garden) offers excellent views of the city.

'''Altenburg'''

[[Image:AltenburgEingang.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Bamberg Altenburg]]
The [[Altenburg (Bamberg)|Altenburg]] is located at the highest of Bamberg's seven hills. It was mentioned for the first time in 1109.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.roadstoruins.com/altenburg.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  Between 1251 and 1553 it was the residence of Bamberg's bishops. Destroyed in 1553 by [[Albert Alcibiades, Margrave of Brandenburg-Kulmbach]], it was used, after scanty repairs, only as a prison, and increasingly decayed.

In 1801 doctor A. F. Marcus bought the castle and completely repaired it. His friend, the famous German writer  [[E.T.A. Hoffmann]], who was very impressed by the building, lived there for a while. The next owner, Anton von Greifenstein, founded in 1818 an association to save the castle. This society still maintains the whole property today. The Altenburg serves as a high-class restaurant and has a beautiful view.

'''Other sights'''
[[Image:Bamberg-StMichael1-Asio.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Michaelsberg Abbey]]
Other noteworthy churches are the ''Jakobskirche'', an 11th-century Romanesque [[basilica]]; the ''St. Martinskirche''; the ''Marienkirche'' or ''Obere Pfarrkirche'' (1320–1387), which has now been restored to its original pure [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] style. The ''[[Michaelskirche, Bamberg|Michaelskirche]]'', 12th-century Romanesque (restored), on the Michaelsberg, was formerly the church of the [[Rule of St. Benedict|Benedictine]] [[Michaelsberg Abbey, Bamberg|Michaelsberg Abbey]] secularized in 1803 and now contains the ''Bürgerspital'', or [[almshouse]], and the [[museum]] and municipal art collections.

Of the bridges connecting the sections of the lower town, a very interesting one is the ''Obere Brücke'', completed in 1455. Halfway across this, on an island, is the ''Rathaus'' or City Hall (rebuilt 1744-1756). The royal lyceum, formerly a [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] college, contains notable collections and the royal library of over 300,000 volumes. The picturesque Old Palace (''Alte Hofhaltung'') was built in 1591 on the site of an old residence of the counts of [[Babenberg]]. Noteworthy among the monuments of the town is the Maximilian fountain (1880), with statues of [[Maximilian I of Bavaria]], the emperor Henry II and his wife, [[Conrad III of Germany|Conrad III]] and [[Otto of Bamberg|Saint Otto]], bishop of Bamberg.

== Education ==
The University of Bamberg, named [[Otto-Friedrich University]], offers higher education in the areas of [[social science]], [[business studies]] and the [[humanities]], and is attended by more than 9300 students.
Bamberg is also home to eight secondary schools called [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasiums]]:
* Clavius-Gymnasium
* [[Dientzenhofer]]-Gymnasium
* Eichendorff-Gymnasium
* [[E.T.A. Hoffmann]]-Gymnasium
* Franz-Ludwig-Gymnasium
* Kaiser-Heinrich-Gymnasium
* Maria-Ward-Gymnasium
* Theresianum
There are also numerous other institutes for primary, secondary, technical, vocational and adult education.

== Infrastructure ==
=== Railway ===
The [[InterCityExpress]] main line #28 ([[Munich]] - [[Nuremberg]] - [[Leipzig]] - [[Berlin]] / [[Hamburg]]) runs through Bamberg on the [[Nuremberg–Bamberg railway|Nuremberg–Bamberg]] and the [[Bamberg–Hof railway|Bamberg–Hof lines]]. To Munich the train journey takes less than two hours. To Berlin it takes about four hours as of 2007; but construction of the [[Nuremberg–Erfurt high-speed railway]] through the Thuringian mountains has been underway for some years. 

East-west connections are poorer. Bamberg is connected to other towns in eastern Upper Franconia such as [[Bayreuth]], [[Coburg]], and [[Kronach]] via the [[Bamberg–Hof railway|Bamberg–Hof line]] with usually at least an hourly regional service. Connections on the [[Würzburg–Bamberg railway|Würzburg–Bamberg line]] to the west are hourly regional trains to Würzburg, which is fully connected to the ICE network. Tourists arriving at [[Frankfurt International Airport]] will have to change trains in Würzburg to get to Bamberg or take a detour via Nuremberg.

=== Motorways ===
Bamberg is not near any of the major (i.e. single-digit) [[Autobahns]]. But it is nevertheless well connected to the network: the [[Bundesautobahn 70|A70]] from [[Schweinfurt]] (connecting to the [[Bundesautobahn 7|A7]] there) to Bayreuth (connecting to the [[Bundesautobahn 9|A9]]) runs along the northern edge of the town. The [[Bundesautobahn 73|A73]] on the eastern side of town connects Bamberg to Nuremberg (connecting to the [[Bundesautobahn 9|A9]]) and [[Thuringia]], ending at [[Suhl]].

=== Air transport ===
Bamberg is served by [[Bamberg-Breitenau Airfield]]. At &quot;Flugplatz Bamberg-Breitenau&quot; are operating mostly public aircraft, although it is classified as a military airport (IATA-Code: ZCD, ICAO-Code: ETEJ). &lt;br /&gt;
It is also possible to charter public flights to and from this airport. &lt;br /&gt;
Most international tourists who travel by plane arrive at [[Frankfurt International Airport]] or [[Munich Airport]]. The nearest bigger airport is [[Nuremberg Airport]] which can be reached within half an hour by car or one hour by train and subway.

=== Water transport ===
Both the [[Rhine-Main-Danube Canal]] and its predecessor, the [[Ludwig Canal]], begin near Bamberg. The Ludwig Canal was opened in 1846 but closed in 1950 after damage during the [[World War II|second world war]]. With the completion of the Rhine-Main-Danube Canal in 1992, uninterrupted water transport was again made possible between the [[North Sea]] and the [[Black Sea]].

=== Local transport ===
Local transport within Bamberg relies exclusively on buses. More than 20 lines connect the outlying quarters and some villages in the vicinity to the Central Bus Station. In addition, there are several &quot;Night Lines&quot; (the last of these, though, tend to run around midnight) and some [[Park and Ride]] lines from parking lots on the periphery to the town centre. &lt;br /&gt;A short-lived tram system existed in the 1920s.

== Politics ==
Bamberg is an [[independent city]]. Its town council (''Stadtrat'') and its Lord Mayor (''Oberbürgermeister'') are elected every six years, though not in the same year. Thus, the last municipal election for the town council was in 2008, for the Lord Mayor in 2006.

As of March 2008, the 44 member-town-council comprises 15 [[Christian Social Union of Bavaria|CSU]] councillors, 10 [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] councillors, 7 [[Alliance '90/The Greens|Green]] councillors, 5 councillors of the Bamberger Bürger-Block and 3 of the Freie Wähler (Free Voters), both local political movements. These five parties achieved the number of councillors necessary to form a [[caucus]]. In addition, there are 2 councillors of the Bamberger Realisten and one of the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|FDP]] and the far-right [[Republicans (Germany)]], making them ineligible for caucus status. This is the result of the municipal elections of 2 March 2008.

'''Charles William &quot;Bill&quot; Mumy, Jr.''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|m|uː|m|i}}; born February 1, 1954) is an [[United States|American]] [[actor]], [[musician]], pitchman, [[instrumentalist]], [[voice-over artist]] and a figure in the [[science-fiction]] community. He is known primarily for his work as a child television actor.

The red-headed Mumy came to prominence in the 1960s as a [[child actor]], most notably as Will Robinson, the youngest of the three children of Prof. John and Dr. Maureen Robinson (played by [[Guy Williams]] and [[June Lockhart]] respectively) and friend of the nefarious and pompous Dr. Zachary Smith (played by [[Jonathan Harris]]), in the cult 1960s [[CBS]] sci-fi [[television series]] ''[[Lost in Space]]''.

He later appeared as a lonely teenager, [[Sterling North]], in the 1969 [[Disney]] [[movie]], ''[[Rascal (film)|Rascal]]'', and as Teft in the 1971 film ''[[Bless the Beasts and Children]]''. In the 1990s, he had the role of [[Lennier]] in the syndicated sci-fi TV series ''[[Babylon 5]]'', and he also served as narrator of [[A&amp;E Network]]'s [[Emmy Award]]-winning series, ''[[Biography (TV series)|Biography]]''. He is also notable for his musical career, as a solo artist and as half of the duo [[Barnes &amp; Barnes]].
