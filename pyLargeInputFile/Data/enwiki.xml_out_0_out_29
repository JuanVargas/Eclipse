The family Formicidae belongs to the order [[Hymenoptera]], which also includes [[sawfly|sawflies]], [[bee]]s and [[wasp]]s. Ants evolved from a lineage within the [[Vespoidea|vespoid]] wasps. [[Phylogenetic]] analysis suggests that ants arose in the mid-[[Cretaceous]] period about 110 to 130&amp;nbsp;million years ago. After the rise of [[flowering plant]]s about 100&amp;nbsp;million years ago they diversified and assumed ecological dominance around 60&amp;nbsp;million years ago.&lt;ref name=&quot;grimaldi2001&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

During the Cretaceous period, a few species of primitive ants ranged widely on the [[Laurasia]]n super-continent (the northern hemisphere). They were scarce in comparison to other insects, representing about 1% of the insect population. Ants became dominant after [[adaptive radiation]] at the beginning of the [[Tertiary period]]. By the [[Oligocene]] and [[Miocene]] ants had come to represent 20-40% of all insects found in major fossil deposits. Of the species that lived in the [[Eocene]] epoch, approximately one in ten genera survive to the present. Genera surviving today comprise 56% of the genera in [[Baltic region|Baltic]] amber fossils (early Oligocene), and 92% of the genera in [[Dominican Republic|Dominican]] amber fossils (apparently early Miocene).&lt;ref name=&quot;grimaldi2001&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=TheAntEvo&gt;Hölldobler &amp; Wilson (1990), pp. 23-24&lt;/ref&gt;

==Morphology==
Ants are distinct in their [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] from other insects in having elbowed [[antenna (biology)|antennae]], [[metapleural gland]]s, and a strong constriction of their second [[Abdomen|abdominal]] segment into a node-like [[petiole (insect)|petiole]]. The head, [[mesosoma]] and [[metasoma]] or gaster are the three distinct body segments. The petiole forms a narrow waist between their mesosoma ([[thorax]] plus the first abdominal segment, which is fused to it) and gaster (abdomen less the abdominal segments in the petiole). The petiole can be formed by one or two nodes (the second alone, or the second and third abdominal segments).&lt;ref&gt;Borror, Triplehorn &amp; Delong (1989), p. 737&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Bullant head detail.jpg|thumb|right|[[Myrmecia|Bull ant]] showing the powerful mandibles and the relatively large compound eyes that provide excellent vision.]]

Like other insects, ants have an [[exoskeleton]], an external covering that provides a protective casing around the body and a point of attachment for muscles, in contrast to the internal skeletons of humans and other [[vertebrate]]s. Insects do not have lungs; oxygen and other gases like [[carbon dioxide]] pass through their exoskeleton through tiny valves called [[spiracle]]s. Insects also lack closed blood vessels; instead, they have a long, thin, perforated tube along the top of the body (called the &quot;dorsal aorta&quot;) that functions like a heart, and pumps [[haemolymph]] towards the head, thus driving the circulation of the internal fluids. The [[nervous system]] consists of a [[ventral nerve cord]] that runs the length of the body, with several [[ganglia]] and branches along the way reaching into the extremities of the appendages.&lt;ref name=&quot;insectmorph&quot;&gt;Borror, Triplehorn &amp; Delong (1989), pp. 24-71&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Scheme ant worker anatomy-en.svg|thumb|450px|left|Diagram of a worker ant (''Pachycondyla verenae'').]]

An ant's head contains many sensory organs. Like most insects, ants have [[compound eye]]s made from numerous tiny lenses attached together. Ants' eyes are good for acute movement detection but do not give a high [[Optical resolution|resolution]]. They also have three small [[ocellus|ocelli]] (simple eyes) on the top of the head that detect light levels and [[polarization (waves)|polarization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Some ants such as Australia's [[Myrmecia|bulldog ant]], however, have exceptional vision. Two [[antenna (biology)|antennae]] (&quot;feelers&quot;) are attached to the head; these organs detect chemicals, air currents and vibrations; they are also used to transmit and receive signals through touch. The head has two strong jaws, the [[Mandible (insect)|mandibles]], used to carry food, manipulate objects, construct nests, and for defence.&lt;ref name=&quot;insectmorph&quot;/&gt; In some species a small pocket (infrabuccal chamber) inside the mouth stores food, so it can be passed to other ants or their larvae.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

All six [[arthropod leg|legs]] are attached to the [[mesosoma]] (&quot;thorax&quot;). A hooked [[Chelae|claw]] at the end of each leg helps ants to climb and hang onto surfaces. Most [[Queen (insect)|queens]] and male ants have [[insect wing|wings]]; queens shed the wings after the [[nuptial flight]], leaving visible stubs, a distinguishing feature of queens. However, wingless queens (ergatoids) and males occur in a few species.&lt;ref name=&quot;insectmorph&quot;/&gt;

The [[metasoma]] (the &quot;abdomen&quot;) of the ant houses important internal organs, including those of the reproductive, respiratory (tracheae) and excretory systems. Workers of many species have their [[ovipositor|egg-laying structures]] modified into [[stinger (organ)|stings]] that are used for subduing [[predation|prey]] and defending their nests.&lt;ref name=&quot;insectmorph&quot;/&gt;

[[Image:Atta.cephalotes.gamut.selection.jpg|thumb|right|Seven [[Leafcutter ant]] workers of various castes (left) and two Queens (right).]]
In the colonies of a few ant species, there are physical castes&amp;mdash;workers in distinct size-classes, called minor, median, and major workers. Often the larger ants have disproportionately larger heads, and correspondingly stronger [[mandible (insect)|mandibles]]. Such individuals are sometimes called &quot;soldier&quot; ants because their stronger mandibles make them more effective in fighting, although they are still workers and their &quot;duties&quot; typically do not vary greatly from the minor or median workers. In a few species the median workers are absent, creating a sharp divide between the minors and majors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=[[E. O.

==Development and reproduction==
[[Image:Meat eater ant nest swarming02.jpg|thumb|Meat eater ant nest during swarming.]]

The life of an ant starts from an [[egg (biology)|egg]]. If the egg is fertilised, the progeny will be female ([[diploid]]); if not, it will be male ([[haploid]]). Ants develop by [[complete metamorphosis]] with the [[larva]]l stages passing through a [[pupa]]l stage before emerging as an adult. The larva is largely immobile and is fed and cared for by workers. Food is given to the larvae by [[trophallaxis]], a process in which an ant [[Regurgitation (digestion)|regurgitates]] liquid food held in its [[Crop (anatomy)|crop]]. This is also how adults share food, stored in the &quot;social stomach&quot;, among themselves. Larvae may also be provided with solid food such as [[trophic egg]]s, pieces of prey and seeds brought back by foraging workers and may even be transported directly to captured prey in some species. The larvae grow through a series of [[moult]]s and enter the pupal stage. The pupa has the appendages free and not fused to the body as in a [[Chrysalis|butterfly pupa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gillott, Cedric|year=1995|title=Entomology|publisher=Springer|isbn=0-306-44967-6|page=325}}&lt;/ref&gt; The differentiation into queens and workers (which are both female), and different [[caste (biology)|caste]]s of workers (when they exist), is influenced in some species by the nutrition the larvae obtain. Genetic influences and the [[polyphenism|control of gene expression]] by the developmental environment are complex and the determination of caste continues to be a subject of research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The causes and consequences of genetic caste determination in ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae)|first1=Kirk E.|last1=Anderson|first2=Timothy A. |last2=Linksvayer|first3=Chris R. |last3=Smith|journal=Myrmecol.

A new worker spends the first few days of its adult life caring for the queen and young. It then graduates to digging and other nest work, and later to defending the nest and foraging.

Most ant species have a system in which only the queen and breeding females have the ability to mate. Contrary to popular belief, some ant nests have multiple queens while others can exist without queens. Workers with the ability to reproduce are called &quot;gamergates&quot; and colonies that lack queens are then called gamergate colonies; colonies with queens are said to be queen-right.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Peeters C, Holldobler B|year=1995|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=92|pages=10977–10979|url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/reprint/92/24/10977.pdf|format=PDF|title=Reproductive cooperation between queens and their mated workers: The complex life history of an ant with a valuable nest|doi=10.1073/pnas.92.24.10977|pmid=11607589|issue=24|pmc=40553}}&lt;/ref&gt; The winged male ants, called drones, emerge from pupae along with the breeding females (although some species, like [[army ant]]s, have wingless queens), and do nothing in life except eat and mate. Most ants are [[univoltine]], producing a new generation each year.&lt;ref name=bloodywasp&gt;{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=Richard W.|year=2007 |chapter=Bloody funny wasps!

Typically, the males take flight before the females. Males then use visual cues to find a common mating ground, for example, a landmark such as a pine tree to which other males in the area converge. Males secrete a mating pheromone that females follow. Females of some species mate with just one male, but in some others they may mate with anywhere from one to ten or more different males.&lt;ref name=TheAntsRelations&gt;Hölldobler &amp; Wilson (1990)&lt;/ref&gt; Mated females then seek a suitable place to begin a colony. There, they break off their wings and begin to lay and care for eggs. The females store the [[Spermatozoon|sperm]] they obtain during their nuptial flight to selectively fertilise future eggs. The first workers to hatch are weak and smaller than later workers, but they begin to serve the colony immediately. They enlarge the nest, forage for food and care for the other eggs. This is how new colonies start in most species. Species that have multiple queens may have a queen leaving the nest along with some workers to found a colony at a new site,&lt;ref name = HolldoblerWilsonAnts2&gt;Hölldobler &amp; Wilson (1990), pp. 143-179&lt;/ref&gt; a process akin to [[Swarming (honey bee)|swarming]] in [[honeybee]]s.

[[Image:FlyingAnts.jpg|thumb|Ants mating.]]
A wide range of reproductive strategies have been noted in ant species.

Ant colonies can be long-lived. The queens can live for up to 30&amp;nbsp;years, and workers live from 1 to 3&amp;nbsp;years. Males, however, are more transitory, and survive only a few weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Keller L|year=1998 |title=Queen lifespan and colony characteristics in ants and termites |journal=[[Insectes Sociaux]] |volume=45 |pages=235–246 |doi=10.1007/s000400050084}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ant queens are estimated to live 100 times longer than solitary insects of a similar size.&lt;ref name=insencyc&gt;{{cite book|author=Franks NR, Resh VH, Cardé RT (eds)|year=2003|title=Encyclopedia of Insects|pages=29–32|isbn=0-12-586990-8|publisher=Academic Press|location=San Diego}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ants are active all year long in the tropics but, in cooler regions, survive the winter in a state of dormancy or inactivity. The forms of inactivity are varied and some temperate species have larvae going into the inactive state ([[diapause]]), while in others, the adults alone pass the winter in a state of reduced activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kipyatkov VE|year=2001|title=Seasonal life cycles and the forms of dormancy in ants (Hymenoptera, Formicoidea)|journal=Acta Societatis Zoologicae Bohemicae|volume=65|issue=2|pages=198–217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Behaviour and ecology==
===Communication===
[[Image:WeaverAntsAgainstRedAnt.JPG|thumb|Weaver ants collaborating to dismember a red ant (the two at the extremities are pulling the red ant, while the middle one cuts the red ant until it snaps).]]
Ants communicate with each other using [[pheromone]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jackson DE, Ratnieks FL |title=Communication in ants |journal=Curr. Biol. |volume=16 |issue=15 |pages=R570–R574 |year=2006 |month=August |pmid=16890508 |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2006.07.015 |url=http://www.cell.com/current-biology/retrieve/pii/S0960982206018343}}&lt;/ref&gt; These chemical signals are more developed in ants than in other [[hymenopteran]] groups. Like other insects, ants perceive smells with their long, thin and mobile antennae. The paired antennae provide information about the direction and intensity of scents. Since most ants live on the ground, they use the soil surface to leave pheromone trails that can be followed by other ants. In species that forage in groups, a forager that finds food marks a trail on the way back to the colony; this trail is followed by other ants, these ants then reinforce the trail when they head back with food to the colony. When the food source is exhausted, no new trails are marked by returning ants and the scent slowly dissipates. This behaviour helps ants deal with changes in their environment. For instance, when an established path to a food source is blocked by an obstacle, the foragers leave the path to explore new routes. If an ant is successful, it leaves a new trail marking the shortest route on its return. Successful trails are followed by more ants, reinforcing better routes and gradually finding the best path.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Goss S, Aron S, Deneubourg JL, Pasteels JM|year=1989|title=Self-organized shortcuts in the Argentine ant|journal=Naturwissenschaften |volume=76 |pages=579–581 |doi=10.1007/BF00462870 |bibcode=1989NW.....76..579G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ants use pheromones for more than just making trails. A crushed ant emits an alarm pheromone that sends nearby ants into an attack frenzy and attracts more ants from further away. Several ant species even use &quot;propaganda pheromones&quot; to confuse enemy ants and make them fight among themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=D'Ettorre P, Heinze J |journal=[[Acta ethologica]] |year=2001 |volume=3 |pages=67–82 |title=Sociobiology of slave-making ants |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/cj1arl0gqb2amw7h/

===Learning===
Many animals can learn behaviours by imitation but ants may be the only group apart from [[mammal]]s where interactive teaching has been observed. A knowledgeable forager of ''[[Temnothorax albipennis]]'' leads a naive nest-mate to newly discovered food by the process of [[tandem running]]. The follower obtains knowledge through its leading tutor. Both leader and follower are acutely sensitive to the progress of their partner with the leader slowing down when the follower lags, and speeding up when the follower gets too close.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Franks NR, Richardson T| year=2006 |title=Teaching in tandem-running ants|journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=439 |issue=7073 |page=153|pmid=16407943 |doi=10.1038/439153a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Controlled experiments with colonies of ''Cerapachys biroi'' suggest that individuals may choose nest roles based on their previous experience. An entire generation of identical workers was divided into two groups whose outcome in food foraging was controlled. One group was continually rewarded with prey, while it was made certain that the other failed. As a result, members of the successful group intensified their foraging attempts while the unsuccessful group ventured out less and less. A month later, the successful foragers continued in their role while the others moved to specialise in brood care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ravary F, Lecoutey E, Kaminski G, Châline N, Jaisson P| year=2007 |title=Individual experience alone can generate lasting division of labor in ants|journal=[[Current Biology]] |volume=17 |issue=15 |pages=1308–1312 |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2007.06.047 |pmid=17629482}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nest construction===
{{Main|Ant colony}}
[[Image:WeaverAntNest.JPG|thumb|Leaf nest of [[weaver ants]], [[Pamalican]], [[Philippines]].]]
Complex nests are built by many ants, but other species are nomadic and do not build permanent structures. Ants may form subterranean nests or build them on trees. These nests can be found in the ground, under stones or logs, inside logs, hollow stems or even acorns. The materials used for construction include soil and plant matter,&lt;ref name = HolldoblerWilsonAnts2/&gt; and ants carefully select their nest sites; ''[[Temnothorax albipennis]]'' will avoid sites with dead ants, as these may indicate the presence of pests or disease. They are quick to abandon established nests at the first sign of threats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Franks NR, Hooper J, Webb C, Dornhaus A|year= 2005|title=Tomb evaders: house-hunting hygiene in ants|journal=[[Biology Letters]]|volume=1|issue=2|pages=190–192|doi=10.1098/rsbl.2005.0302|pmid=17148163|pmc=1626204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[army ant]]s of South America and the [[driver ant]]s of Africa do not build permanent nests, but instead alternate between nomadism and stages where the workers form a temporary nest ([[bivouac (ants)|bivouac]]) from their own bodies, by holding each other together.&lt;ref&gt;Hölldobler &amp; Wilson (1990), p. 573&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Weaver ant]] (''Oecophylla'' spp.) workers build nests in trees by attaching leaves together, first pulling them together with bridges of workers and then inducing their larvae to produce silk as they are moved along the leaf edges. Similar forms of nest construction are seen in some species of ''Polyrhachis''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Robson SK, Kohout RJ|year=2005|title=Evolution of nest-weaving behaviour in arboreal nesting ants of the genus ''Polyrhachis'' Fr.

===Food cultivation===
{{Main|Ant-fungus mutualism}}
[[Image:HoneyAnt.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Myrmecocystus]]'', [[honeypot ant]]s, store food to prevent colony famine.]]
Most ants are generalist predators, scavengers and indirect herbivores,&lt;ref name=riseofants/&gt; but a few have evolved specialised ways of obtaining nutrition. [[Leafcutter ant]]s (''[[Atta (genus)|Atta]]'' and ''[[Acromyrmex]]'') feed exclusively on a [[fungus]] that grows only within their colonies. They continually collect leaves which are taken to the colony, cut into tiny pieces and placed in fungal gardens. Workers specialise in tasks according to their sizes. The largest ants cut stalks, smaller workers chew the leaves and the smallest tend the fungus. Leafcutter ants are sensitive enough to recognise the reaction of the fungus to different plant material, apparently detecting chemical signals from the fungus. If a particular type of leaf is toxic to the fungus the colony will no longer collect it. The ants feed on structures produced by the fungi called ''[[gongylidia]]''. [[Symbiosis|Symbiotic]] bacteria on the exterior surface of the ants produce antibiotics that kill bacteria that may harm the fungi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Nature|year=1999|volume=398|title=Ants, plants and antibiotics|author=Schultz TR|pages=747–748 | doi = 10.1038/19619|issue=6730 |url=http://www.insecta.ufv.br/Entomologia/ent/disciplina/ban%20160/AULAP/aula2/AntsandBacteria.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Locomotion===
Worker ants do not have wings and reproductive females lose their wings after their mating flights in order to begin their colonies. Therefore, unlike their wasp ancestors, most ants travel by walking. Some species are capable of leaping. For example, Jerdon's jumping ant (''[[Harpegnathos saltator]]'') is able to jump by synchronising the action of its mid and hind pairs of legs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Baroni-Urbani C, Boyan GS, Blarer A, Billen J, Musthak Ali TM|year=1994 |title=A novel mechanism for jumping in the Indian ant ''Harpegnathos saltator'' (Jerdon) (Formicidae, Ponerinae) |journal=[[Experientia]] |volume=50 |pages=63–71 |doi=10.1007/BF01992052}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are several species of [[gliding ant]] including ''Cephalotes atratus''; this may be a common trait among most arboreal ants.

Other species of ants can form chains to bridge gaps over water, underground, or through spaces in vegetation. Some species also form floating rafts that help them survive floods. These rafts may also have a role in allowing ants to colonise islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Morrison LW|year=1998|title=A review of Bahamian ant (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) biogeography|journal=Journal of Biogeography|volume=25|issue=3|pages=561–571|doi=10.1046/j.1365-2699.1998.2530561.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Polyrhachis sokolova]]'', a species of ant found in [[Australia]]n [[mangrove]] swamps, can swim and live in underwater nests.

===Cooperation and competition===
[[File:Ants eating cicada, jjron 22.11.2009.jpg|thumb|right|[[Meat ant|Meat-eater ants]] feeding on a [[cicada]]. Social ants cooperate and collectively gather food.]]
Not all ants have the same kind of societies. The Australian [[bulldog ant]]s are among the biggest and most [[basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] of ants. Like virtually all ants they are [[Eusociality|eusocial]], but their social behaviour is poorly developed compared to other species.

Some species (such as ''[[Tetramorium caespitum]]'') attack and take over neighbouring ant colonies. Others are less expansionist but just as aggressive; they invade colonies to steal eggs or larvae, which they either eat or raise as workers/slaves. Extreme specialists among these slave-raiding ants, such as the [[Amazon ant]]s, are incapable of feeding themselves and need captured workers to survive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Diehl E, Junqueira LK, Berti-Filho E|year=2005 |title=Ant and termite mound coinhabitants in the wetlands of Santo Antonio da Patrulha, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil|journal=[[Brazilian Journal of Biology]] |volume=65 |issue=3 |pages=431–437 |url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S1519-69842005000300008&amp;lng=en&amp;nrm=iso |doi=10.1590/S1519-69842005000300008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Captured workers of the enslaved species ''Temnothorax'' have evolved a counter strategy, destroying just the female pupae of the slave-making ''[[Protomognathus americanus]]'', but sparing the males (who don't take part in slave-raiding as adults).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Evolution|year=2009|volume=63|issue=4|pages=1068–1075|title= First evidence for slave rebellion: enslaved ant workers systematically kill the brood of their social parasite ''Protomognathus americanus''.|last=Achenbach|first=A|doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.2009.00591.x|last2=Foitzik|first2=Susanne|pmid=19243573}} See also [[New Scientist]], 2009 April 9&lt;/ref&gt;

Ants identify kin and nestmates through their scent, which comes from [[hydrocarbon]]-laced secretions that coat their exoskeletons. If an ant is separated from its original colony, it will eventually lose the colony scent. Any ant that enters a colony without a matching scent will be attacked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Henderson G, Andersen JF, Phillips JK, Jeanne RL|year=2005 |title=Internest aggression and identification of possible nestmate discrimination pheromones in polygynous ant ''Formica montana'' |journal=[[Journal of Chemical Ecology]] |volume=16 |issue=7 |pages=2217–2228 |doi=10.1007/BF01026932}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parasitic ant species enter the colonies of host ants and establish themselves as social parasites; species like ''Strumigenys xenos'' are entirely parasitic and do not have workers, but instead rely on the food gathered by their ''Strumigenys perplexa'' hosts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ward PS|year=1996|title=A new workerless social parasite in the ant genus ''Pseudomyrmex'' (Hymenoptera: Formicidae), with a discussion of the origin of social parasitism in ants|journal=[[Systematic Entomology]]|volume= 21|pages=253–263|url=http://www.archive.org/details/ants_08424|doi=10.1046/j.1365-3113.1996.d01-12.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Taylor RW|year=1968|title=The Australian workerless inquiline ant, ''Strumigenys xenos'' Brown (Hymenoptera-Formicidae) recorded from New Zealand|journal= New Zealand Entomologist|volume=4|issue=1|pages=47–49|url=http://www.archive.org/details/ants_10687}}&lt;/ref&gt; This form of parasitism is seen across many ant genera, but the parasitic ant is usually a species that is closely related to its host. A variety of methods are employed to enter the nest of the host ant. A parasitic queen can enter the host nest before the first brood has hatched, establishing herself prior to development of a colony scent. Other species use pheromones to confuse the host ants or to trick them into carrying the parasitic queen into the nest. Some simply fight their way into the nest.&lt;ref name=TheAntParasites&gt;Hölldobler &amp; Wilson (1990), pp. 436&amp;mdash;448&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[sexual conflict|conflict between the sexes]] of a species is seen in some species of ants with the reproductives apparently competing to produce offspring that are as closely related to them as possible. The most extreme form involves the production of clonal offspring. An extreme of sexual conflict is seen in ''[[Wasmannia auropunctata]]'', where the queens produce diploid daughters by thelytokous parthenogenesis and males produce clones by a process where a diploid egg loses its maternal contribution to produce haploid males that are clones of the father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Clonal reproduction by males and females in the little fire ant|author=Fournier, D, Estoup A, Orivel J, Foucaud J, Jourdan H, Le Breton J, Keller L|year=2005|journal=Nature|volume=435|doi=10.1038/nature03705|pages=1230–1234|pmid=15988525|issue=7046}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationships with other organisms===
[[File:Myrmarachne plataleoides female thailand.jpg|thumb|The spider ''[[Myrmarachne plataleoides]]'' (here a female) mimics [[weaver ant]]s to avoid predators.]]
Ants form [[symbiotic]] associations with a range of species, including other ant species, other insects, plants, and fungi. They are preyed on by many animals and even certain fungi. Some arthropod species spend part of their lives within ant nests, either preying on ants, their larvae and eggs, consuming the ants' food stores, or avoiding predators. These [[inquiline]]s can bear a close resemblance to ants. The nature of this [[ant mimicry]] (myrmecomorphy) varies, with some cases involving [[Batesian mimicry]], where the mimic reduces the risk of predation. Others show [[Wasmannian mimicry]], a form of mimicry seen only in inquilines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Ant-mimicry in Panamanian clubionid and salticid spiders (Araneae: Clubionidae, Salticidae)|author=Reiskind J|journal=Biotropica|volume=9|issue=1|year=1977|pages=1–8|doi=10.2307/2387854|url=http://jstor.org/stable/2387854}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Myrmecomorphy and myrmecophily in spiders: A Review|author=Cushing PE|journal=The Florida Entomologist|volume=80|issue=2|year=1997|pages=165–193|doi=10.2307/3495552|url=http://www.fcla.edu/FlaEnt/fe80p165.pdf|format=PDF|jstor=3495552}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Ant Receives Honeydew from Aphid.jpg|thumb|left|An ant collects [[honeydew (secretion)|honeydew]] from an [[aphid]].]]
[[Aphid]]s and other [[hemiptera]]n insects secrete a sweet liquid called [[Honeydew (secretion)|honeydew]] when they feed on [[plant sap]]. The sugars in honeydew are a high-energy food source, which many ant species collect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Styrsky JD, Eubanks MD |title=Ecological consequences of interactions between ants and honeydew-producing insects |journal=Proc.

The ants in turn keep predators away and will move the aphids between feeding locations. On migrating to a new area, many colonies will take the aphids with them, to ensure a continued supply of honeydew. Ants also tend [[mealybug]]s to harvest their honeydew. Mealybugs can become a serious pest of pineapples if ants are present to protect mealybugs from their natural enemies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jahn GC, Beardsley JW |year=1996 |title=Effects of ''Pheidole megacephala'' (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) on survival and dispersal of ''Dysmicoccus neobrevipes'' (Homoptera: Pseudococcidae) |journal=[[Journal of Economic Entomology]] |volume=89 |pages=1124–1129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Myrmecophile|Myrmecophilous]] (ant-loving) [[caterpillar]]s of the family [[Lycaenidae]] (e.g., blues, coppers, or hairstreaks) are herded by the ants, led to feeding areas in the daytime, and brought inside the ants' nest at night.

[[Fungus-growing ants]] that make up the tribe [[Attini]], including [[leafcutter ant]]s, cultivate certain species of fungus in the ''[[Leucoagaricus]]'' or ''[[Leucocoprinus]]'' genera of the [[Agaricaceae]] family. In this [[ant-fungus mutualism]], both species depend on each other for survival. The ant ''[[Allomerus decemarticulatus]]'' has evolved a three-way association with the host plant ''[[Hirtella physophora]]'' (Chrysobalanaceae), and a sticky fungus which is used to trap their insect prey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dejean A, Solano PJ, Ayroles J, Corbara B, Orivel J |year=2005 |title=Arboreal ants build traps to capture prey |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=434|page=973 |doi=10.1038/434973a |pmid=15846335 |issue=7036}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship with humans==
[[Image:AntsStitchingLeave.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Weaver ant]]s are used as a [[biological control]] for citrus cultivation in southern China.]]
Ants perform many ecological roles that are beneficial to humans, including the suppression of [[Pest (organism)|pest]] populations and aeration of the [[soil]]. The use of [[weaver ant]]s in citrus cultivation in southern China is considered one of the oldest known applications of [[biological control]].&lt;ref name = HolldoblerWilsonAnts3&gt;Hölldobler &amp; Wilson (1990), pp. 619-629&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, ants can become nuisances when they invade buildings, or cause economic losses.

In some parts of the world (mainly Africa and South America), large ants, especially [[army ant]]s, are used as [[surgical suture]]s. The wound is pressed together and ants are applied along it. The ant seizes the edges of the wound in its mandibles and locks in place. The body is then cut off and the head and mandibles remain in place to close the wound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gottrup F, Leaper D|year=2004 |title=Wound healing: Historical aspects |journal=[[EWMA Journal]] |volume=4 |issue=2 |url=http://www.ewma.org/pdf/fall04/Historical_Aspects.pdf |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070616090223/http://www.ewma.org/pdf/fall04/Historical_Aspects.pdf |archivedate=2007-06-16|format=PDF|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Gudger EW|year=1925|title=Stitching wounds with the mandibles of ants and beetles|journal=Journal of the American Medical Association|volume=84|pages=1861–1864}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Robert M.|last=Sapolsky|year=2001|title=A Primate's Memoir: A Neuroscientist's Unconventional Life Among the Baboons|page=156|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=0-7432-0241-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some ants of the family Ponerinae have toxic venom and are of medical importance.

In [[South Africa]], ants are used to help harvest [[rooibos]] (''Aspalathus linearis''), which are small seeds used to make a herbal tea. The plant disperses its seeds widely, making manual collection difficult. Black ants collect and store these and other seeds in their nest, where humans can gather them ''en masse''. Up to half a pound (200&amp;nbsp;g) of seeds can be collected from one ant-heap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ciel.org/Publications/InnovativeMechanisms.pdf|format=PDF|title=Innovative mechanisms for sharing benefits of biodiversity and related knowledge|author=Downes D, Laird SA|year=1999|publisher=The Center for International Environmental Law|accessdate=8 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Economic Botany|title=Rooibos tea, a South African contribution to world beverages|volume=17|issue=3|pages=186–194|year=1963|author=Cheney RH, Scholtz E|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/321875k510720085/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although most ants survive attempts by humans to eradicate them, a few are highly endangered. These are mainly island species that have evolved specialized traits and include the critically endangered [[Sri Lankan relict ant]] (''Aneuretus simoni'') and ''[[Adetomyrma venatrix]]'' of Madagascar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The influence of sociality on the conservation biology of social insects|author=Chapman, RE; Bourke, Andrew FG|journal= Ecology Letters|volume=4|issue=6|year=2001|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/120712743/PDFSTART|format=PDF|pages=650–662|doi=10.1046/j.1461-0248.2001.00253.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been estimated by [[E.O. Wilson]] that the total number of individual ants alive in the world at any one time is between one and ten [[quadrillion]] ([[short scale]]). According to this estimate, the total [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]] of all the ants in the world is approximately equal to the total biomass of the entire [[human race]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Holldobler, B &amp; E.

[[File:Ants For Food SG.jpg|thumb|left|Roasted Ants in Colombia]]
[[Image:Ants Eggs Market Thailand.jpg|thumb|left|Ant larvae on sale in [[Isaan]], Thailand.]]
Ants and their larvae are eaten in different parts of the world. The eggs of two species of ants are the basis for the dish in Mexico known as ''[[escamoles]]''. They are considered a form of insect [[caviar]] and can sell for as much as [[USD]]&amp;nbsp;40 per pound (USD&amp;nbsp;90/kg) because they are seasonal and hard to find. In the [[Colombia]]n department of [[Santander Department|Santander]], ''hormigas culonas'' (roughly interpreted as &quot;large-bottomed ants&quot;) ''[[Atta laevigata]]'' are toasted alive and eaten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=DeFoliart GR|title=Insects as food: Why the western attitude is important|journal=Annual Review of Entomology|volume=44|pages=21–50|year=1999|doi=10.1146/annurev.ento.44.1.21|pmid=9990715}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;!-- In many [[movie theater]]s in Colombia, these ants are served as an alternative to [[popcorn]].  --&gt;

In areas of [[India]], and throughout [[Burma]] and [[Thailand]], a paste of the green weaver ant (''[[Oecophylla smaragdina]]'') is served as a condiment with curry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bingham CT|year=1903|title=Fauna of British India. Hymenoptera Volume 3|page=311}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Oecophylla|Weaver ant]] eggs and larvae as well as the ants themselves may be used in a Thai salad, ''yum'' (ยำ), in a dish called ''yum khai mod daeng'' (ยำไข่มดแดง) or red ant egg salad, a dish that comes from the [[Issan]] or north-eastern region of Thailand. [[William Saville-Kent|Saville-Kent]], in the ''Naturalist in Australia'' wrote &quot;Beauty, in the case of the green ant, is more than skin-deep. Their attractive, almost sweetmeat-like translucency possibly invited the first essays at their consumption by the human species&quot;. Mashed up in water, after the manner of lemon squash, &quot;these ants form a pleasant acid drink which is held in high favor by the natives of North Queensland, and is even appreciated by many European palates&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;beq&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bequaert J|year=1921 |title=Insects as food: How they have augmented the food supply of mankind in early and recent times|journal=Natural History Journal|volume=21|pages=191–200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''First Summer in the Sierra'', [[John Muir]] notes that the [[Paiute|Digger Indians]] of [[California]] ate the tickly acid gasters of the large jet-black [[carpenter ant]]s. The Mexican Indians eat the replete workers, or living honey-pots, of the [[honey ant]] (''[[Myrmecocystus]]'').&lt;ref name=&quot;beq&quot;/&gt;

===As pests===
{{See also|Ants of medical importance}}
[[File:Monomorium pharaonis.jpg|thumb|The tiny [[pharaoh ant]] is a major pest in hospitals and office blocks; it can make nests between sheets of paper.]]

Some ant species are considered pests,&lt;ref name=&quot;pests&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipm.ucdavis.edu/PMG/PESTNOTES/pn7411.html|title=Pest Notes: Ants (Publication 7411)|publisher=University of California Agriculture and Natural Resources|year=2007|accessdate=5 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and because of the adaptive nature of ant colonies, eliminating the entire colony is nearly impossible. Pest management is therefore a matter of controlling local populations, instead of eliminating an entire colony, and most attempts at control are temporary solutions.

Ants classified as pests include the [[pavement ant]], [[yellow crazy ant]], [[sugar ant]]s, the [[Pharaoh ant]], [[carpenter ants]], [[Argentine ant]], [[Tapinoma sessile|odorous house ants]], [[red imported fire ant]] and [[Myrmica rubra|European fire ant]]. Populations are controlled using insecticide baits, either in granule or liquid formulations. Bait is gathered by the ants as food and brought back to the nest where the poison is inadvertently spread to other colony members through [[trophallaxis]]. [[Boric acid]] and [[borax]] are often used as [[insecticide]]s that are relatively safe for humans. Bait may be broadcast over a large area to control species like the red fire ant that occupy large areas. Nests of red fire ants may be destroyed by following the ants' trails back to the nest and then pouring boiling water into it to kill the queen. This works in about 60% of the mounds and requires about {{convert|14|l|impgal usgal|0}} per mound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Two step method for fire ant control|url=http://www.ento.okstate.edu/fireants/twostep.htm|publisher =Oklahoma State University|accessdate=5 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anthropomorphism|Anthropomorphised]] ants have often been used in fables and children's stories to represent industriousness and cooperative effort. They are also mentioned in religious texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Quran]] 27:18–19 |url=http://www.wright-house.com/religions/islam/Quran/27-ant.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Sahih Bukhari]] Vol 4, Book 54, Number 536 |url=http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/bukhari/054.sbt.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Book of Proverbs]] in the [[Bible]], ants are held up as a good example for humans for their hard work and cooperation. [[Aesop]] did the same in his fable [[The Ant and the Grasshopper]].

Ant society has always fascinated humans and has been written about both humorously and seriously. [[Mark Twain]] wrote about ants in his ''[[A Tramp Abroad]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=22 The Black Forest and Its Treasures|title=A Tramp Abroad|last=Twain|first=Mark|year=1880|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/119/|isbn=0-19-510137-5|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some modern authors have used the example of the ants to comment on the relationship between society and the individual. Examples are [[Robert Frost]] in his poem &quot;Departmental&quot; and [[T. H. White]] in his fantasy novel ''[[The Once and Future King]]''. The plot in French entomologist and writer [[Bernard Werber]]'s ''[[Les Fourmis]]'' science-fiction trilogy is divided between the worlds of ants and humans; ants and their behaviour is described using contemporary scientific knowledge. In more recent times, animated cartoons and 3D animated movies featuring ants have been produced including ''[[Antz]]'', ''[[A Bug's Life]]'', ''[[The Ant Bully (film)|The Ant Bully]]'', ''[[The Ant and the Aardvark]]'', ''[[Atom Ant]]'', and there is a [[comic book]] superhero called [[Ant-Man]]. Renowned [[Myrmecology|myrmecologist]] [[E. O. Wilson]] wrote a short story, &quot;''Trailhead''&quot; in 2010 for [[The New Yorker]] magazine, which describes the life and death of an ant-queen, and the rise and fall of her colony, from an ants' point of view.&lt;ref name=&quot;Trailhead&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Wilson, EO|url=http://www.newyorker.com/fiction/features/2010/01/25/100125fi_fiction_wilson?currentPage=all |title=Trailhead|publisher=The New Yorker|date=25 January 2010|pages=56–62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Chinese character]] for ant ({{zh|t={{linktext|蟻}}|s={{linktext|蚁}}|p=yǐ}}) is a combination of two [[logogram]]s that may be interpreted as &quot;insect ({{zh|t={{linktext|蟲}}|s={{linktext|虫}}|p=chóng}}) which behaves properly ({{zh|t={{linktext|義}}|s={{linktext|义}}|p=yì}})&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Chinese Characters: A Genealogy and Dictionary|last=Harbaugh|first=Rick|publisher=Yale University Press|year=1998|isbn=0-9660750-0-5|url=http://zhongwen.com/cgi-bin/zipux2.cgi?b5=%C3%C6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The traditional Chinese character ''yǐ'' (蟻) used in [[Japanese language|Japanese]] shares this [[etymology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Hearn L|year=1904 |title=Kwaidan: Stories and studies Of strange things|publisher=Tuttle publishing (2005 reprint)|isbn=0-8048-3662-0|page=223}}&lt;/ref&gt; In spoken [[Chinese language|Chinese]] the ant is usually referred to as ''mǎyĭ'' ({{zh|t={{linktext|螞蟻}}|s={{linktext|蚂蚁}}}}).

From the late 1950s through the late 1970s, [[formicarium|ant farms]] were popular educational children's toys in the United States. Later versions use transparent gel instead of soil allowing greater visibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite |author=Guri, Assaf|title=Habitat media for ants and other invertebrates (US Patent 5803014)|publisher=United States Patent and Trademark Office|date=8 September 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1990s, the video game [[SimAnt]], which simulated an ant colony, won the 1992 [[Codie awards|Codie award]] for &quot;Best Simulation Program&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.siia.net/codies/2009/pw_1992.asp |title= 1992 Excellence in Software Awards Winners |accessdate=3 April 2008|publisher=Software &amp; Information Industry Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ants are also quite popular inspiration for many [[science-fiction]] [[insectoid]]s, such as the Formics of ''[[Ender's Game]]'', the Bugs of ''[[Starship Troopers]]'', the giant ants in the film ''[[Them!]]'', and ants mutated into super intelligence in ''[[Phase IV]]''. In [[strategy games]], ant-based species often benefit from increased production rates due to their single-minded focus, such as the Klackons in the ''[[Master of Orion]]'' series of games or the ChCht in ''[[Deadlock II]]''. These characters are often credited with a [[Group mind (science fiction)|hive mind]], a common misconception about ant colonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Robots, insects and swarm intelligence|journal=Artificial Intelligence Review|volume=26|issue=4|year=2006|author=Sharkey AJC|doi=10.1007/s10462-007-9057-y|pages=255–268}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Arbitration]]''', in the context of United States [[law]], is a form of [[alternative dispute resolution]] &amp;mdash; specifically, a legal alternative to [[litigation]] whereby the parties to a dispute agree to submit their respective positions (through agreement or hearing) to a neutral third party (the arbitrator(s) or arbiter(s)) for resolution. In practice arbitration is generally used as a substitute for judicial systems, particularly when the judicial processes are viewed as too slow, expensive or biased. Arbitration is also used by communities which lack formal law, as a substitute for formal law.

Arbitration may also serve a distinct purpose: as an alternative to strikes and lockouts as a means of resolving labor disputes. Labor arbitration comes in two varieties: '''interest arbitration''', which provides a method for resolving disputes about the terms to be included in a new contract when the parties are unable to agree, and '''grievance arbitration''', which provides a method for resolving disputes over the interpretation and application of a [[collective bargaining agreement]].

==Species of Arbitration==
===Commercial and other forms of contract arbitration===
Agreements to arbitrate were&lt;!--What time period is meant by &quot;were&quot;?--&gt; not enforceable at common law, though once the parties had actually submitted a pending dispute to an arbitrator, the arbitrator's judgment was usually enforceable. The reasoning for this was that the power of the arbitrator arose solely from the ''mutual'' consent of the parties to his jurisdiction; but by the time a dispute reached the point that one party wished to take it to an arbitrator, the other often preferred to take their chances in court instead. Thus, without the consent of both parties to his jurisdiction, the arbitrator lacked the power to decide the case. 

During the [[Industrial Revolution]], large [[corporations]] became increasingly opposed to this policy. They argued that too many valuable [[business]] relationships were being destroyed through years of expensive adversarial [[litigation]], in courts whose rules differed significantly from the informal norms and [[Convention (norm)|convention]]s of businesspeople (the private law of [[commerce]], or ''jus merchant''). Arbitration was promoted as being faster, less adversarial, and cheaper.

The result was the [[New York Arbitration Act]] of 1920, followed by the [[United States Arbitration Act]] of 1925. Both made agreements to arbitrate valid and enforceable (unless one party could show fraud or unconscionability or some other ground for rescission which undermined the validity of the entire contract). The USAA is now known as the [[Federal Arbitration Act]]. Due to the subsequent judicial expansion of the meaning of [[interstate commerce]], the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] reinterpreted the FAA in a series of cases in the 1980s and 1990s to cover almost the full scope of interstate commerce. In the process, the Court held that the FAA preempted many state laws covering arbitration, some of which had been passed by state [[legislature]]s to protect their [[consumer]]s against powerful corporations.

Since commercial arbitration is based upon either contract law or the [[law of treaties]], the agreement between the parties to submit their dispute to arbitration is a legally binding [[contract]]. All arbitral decisions are considered to be &quot;final and binding.&quot; This does not, however, void the requirements of law. Any dispute not excluded from arbitration by virtue of law (for example, criminal proceedings) may be submitted to arbitration.

Furthermore, arbitration agreements can only bind parties who have agreed, expressly or impliedly to arbitrate. Arbitration cannot bind nonsignatories to an arbitration contract, even if those nonsignatories later become involved with a signatory to a contract by accident (usually through the commission of a [[tort]]).&lt;ref&gt;''County of Contra Costa v. Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, Inc.'', [http://online.ceb.com/CalCases/CA4/47CA4t237.htm 47 Cal. App. 4th 237] (1996).  [[Kaiser Permanente]] argued in this case unsuccessfully that third-parties who injure Kaiser members should be forced to arbitrate cross-claims against Kaiser.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Labor arbitration===
Arbitration has also been used as a means of resolving labor disputes for more than a century. Labor organizations in the [[United States]], such as the [[National Labor Union]], called for arbitration as early as 1866 as an alternative to strikes to resolve disputes over the wages, benefits and other rights that workers would enjoy. Governments have also relied on arbitration to resolve particularly large labor disputes, such as the [[Coal Strike of 1902]]. This type of arbitration, wherein a neutral arbitrator decides the terms of the collective bargaining agreement, is commonly known as interest arbitration. The [[United Steelworkers of America]] adopted an elaborate form of interest arbitration, known as the Experimental Negotiating Agreement, in the 1970s as a means of avoiding the long and costly strikes that had made the industry vulnerable to foreign competition. [[Major League Baseball]] uses a variant of interest arbitration, in which an arbitrator chooses between the two sides' final offers, to set the terms for contracts for players who are not eligible for free agency. Interest arbitration is now most frequently used by public employees who have no right to strike (for example,, law enforcement and firefighters).

Unions and employers have also employed arbitration to resolve employee and union grievances arising under a collective bargaining agreement. The [[Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America]] made arbitration a central element of the ''Protocol of Peace'' it negotiated with garment manufacturers in the second decade of the twentieth century. Grievance arbitration became even more popular during [[World War II]], when most unions had adopted a no-strike pledge. The [[War Labor Board]], which attempted to mediate disputes over contract terms, pressed for inclusion of grievance arbitration in collective bargaining agreements. The Supreme Court subsequently made labor arbitration a key aspect of federal labor policy in three cases which came to be known as the Steelworkers' Trilogy. The Court held that grievance arbitration was a preferred dispute resolution technique and that courts could not overturn arbitrators' awards unless the award does not draw its essence from the collective bargaining agreement. State and federal statutes may allow vacating an award on narrow grounds (''e.g.'', fraud). These protections for arbitrator awards are premised on the union-management system, which provides both parties with due process. Due process in this context means that both parties have experienced representation throughout the process, and that the arbitrators practice only as neutrals. ''See'' [[National Academy of Arbitrators]].

===Securities arbitration===
In the United States securities industry, arbitration has long been the preferred method of resolving disputes between brokerage firms, and between firms and their customers. The securities industry uses a pre-dispute arbitration agreement, where the parties agree to arbitrate their disputes before any such dispute arises. Those agreements were upheld by the United States Supreme Court in Shearson v. MacMahon, 482 U.S. 220 (1987) and today nearly all disputes involving brokerage firms are resolved in arbitration.

The process operates under its own rules, and is described in an article [http://www.seclaw.com/arbover.htm Introduction to Securities Arbitration]. Securities arbitrations are held primarily by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ([http://www.finra.org &quot;FINRA&quot;]).

Securities Arbitration before FINRA is purportedly a quick, easy and inexpensive method of resolving securities disputes. Some practitioners disagree. On June 7, 2004, FINRA Dispute Resolution implemented on a national basis various measures to expedite arbitration proceedings in matters involving senior or seriously ill parties.

Generally, from the date a Statement of Claim is filed to a final hearing the process generally takes between 12 and 15 months. Upon receipt of a Statement of Claim, the Respondent (i.e. the brokerage firm's lawyers) have 45 days to respond. Generally, within twenty days following the entry of appearance by counsel or the filing of an Answer, the FINRA Dispute Resolution Staff will provide a list of proposed arbitrators to the parties from which they may rank or strike proposed arbitrators. The parties are provided 20 days to complete and submit these rankings to FINRA.

Typically, depending on which Regional Office of FINRA Dispute Resolution is processing your claim, an Initial Pre-hearing Conference will be scheduled within 30 days of the submission of their arbitrator rankings by the parties.

During the Initial [http://www.securitiesarbitrations.com/Finra-Securities-Arbitration/Securities-Arbitration-Process/Initial-Prehearing-Conference Pre-hearing Conference] (which is held telephonically) according to a script, Initial Prehearing Conference Script, the arbitrators and the parties will select dates for the completion of discovery, the filing of any discovery motions, or other motions, and any telephonic hearings or conferences with respect to these motions, the filing of pre-hearing briefs or memoranda, and the final hearing dates.

Hearings generally last three days. However, three day hearings can easily turn into three week hearings, dispersed over a series of hearing dates over several months, for a variety of reasons, including recalcitrant witnesses, over-zealous counsel, or inattentive arbitrators.

Within 30 days, and often sooner, the Arbitration Panel will render an Award.

Accordingly, it is generally agreed, that in most cases, from the filing of the Statement of Claim to the rendering of an Award, from start to finish, it takes approximately 12 to 18 months in most securities arbitrations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.securitiesarbitrations.com/Finra-Securities-Arbitration/Securities-Arbitration-Process&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judicial arbitration===
Some state court systems have promulgated court-ordered arbitration; family law (particularly child custody) is the most prominent example. Judicial arbitration is often merely advisory dispute resolution technique, serving as the first step toward resolution, but not binding either side and allowing for trial de novo.  Litigation attorneys present their side of the case to an independent teritary lawyer, who issues an opinion on settlement. Should the parties in question decide to continue to dispute resolution process, there can be some sanctions imposed from the initial arbitration per terms of the contract.

== Validity of Arbitration Clauses ==

The validity of arbitration clauses in the US is not a settled legal matter. Typically, the validity of an arbitration clause is decided by a court rather than an arbitrator. However, in a split decision (5-4) on [[Rent-A-Center, West, Inc. v. Jackson]] the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] decided that if the arbitration clause includes a provision which stated that the arbitrator &quot;shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute
relating to  the interpretation, applicability, enforceability&quot;&lt;ref name=SCOTUSRenter-A-Center&gt;[www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/09pdf/09-497.pdf Rent-A-Center, West, Inc. v. Jackson]. Supreme Court of the United States.&lt;/ref&gt; of the clause. The Federal Arbitration Act typically allows federal courts to decide these types of &quot;gateway&quot; or validity questions, but the Supreme Court ruled that since Jackson targeted the entire contract rather than a specific clause, the arbitrator decided the validity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law360.com/articles/176273 High Court Favors Arbitrator In Rent-A-Center Case]. Law360.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

Arbitration clauses of companies such as Blockbuster, AT&amp;T, and Talk America have been ruled unconscionable and, therefore, unenforceable.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas v. Talk America, 495 F.3d 1062 (9th Cir. 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harris v. Blockbuster Inc., No. 3:09-cv-217-M (N.D. Tex. April 15, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; However arbitration clauses have been upheld repeatedly as well.&lt;ref&gt;[[Applebee's]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[insurance]] law, arbitration is complicated by the fact that insurance is regulated at the state level under the [[McCarran–Ferguson Act]]. From a federal perspective, however, a circuit court ruling has determined that McCarran-Ferguson requires a state statute rather than administrative interpretations.&lt;ref name=WenzelKA/&gt; The Missouri Department of Insurance attempted to block a binding arbitration agreement under its state authority, but since this action was based only on a policy of the department and not on a state statute, the [[United States district court]] found that the Department of Insurance did not have the authority to invalidate the arbitration agreement.&lt;ref name=WenzelKA&gt;Wenzel KA. (2004). [http://www.forc.org/public/journals/9#57 THE VALIDITY OF ARBITRATION AGREEMENTS IN INSURANCE POLICIES]. ''FORC Journal'' 15(4).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proceedings==
Various bodies of rules have been developed that can be used for arbitration proceedings. The two most important are the [[UNCITRAL]] rules and the ICSID rules. The rules to be followed by the arbitrator are specified by the agreement establishing the arbitration.

The [[Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards]] (Done at New York, 10 June 1958; Entered into force, 7 June 1959; 330 U.N.T.S. 38, 1959) provides for the enforcement of foreign arbitral awards on the territory of the contracting parties. Similar provisions are contained in the earlier [[Convention on the Execution of Foreign Arbitral Awards]] (Done at Geneva, 26 September 1927; Entered into force, 25 July 1929; L.N.T.S. ???).

Some jurisdictions have instituted a limited grace period during which an arbitral decision may be appealed against, but after which there can be no appeal. In the case of arbitration under international law, a right of appeal does not in general exist, although one may be provided for by the arbitration agreement, provided a court exists capable of hearing the appeal. 

When arbitration occurs under U.S. law, either party to an arbitration may appeal from the arbitrator's decision to a court, however the court will generally not change the arbitrator's findings of fact but will decide only whether the arbitrator was guilty of malfeasance, or whether the arbitrator exceeded the limits of his or her authority in the arbitral award or whether the award conflicts with positive law. The Supreme Court has described the standard of review as one of the narrowest known to Western jurisprudence. Wherever so seen, arbitration may be the best approach to the legal manners and parties involved.

==Arbitrators==
Arbitrators have wide latitude in crafting remedies in the arbitral decision, with the only real limitation being that they may not exceed the limits of their authority in their award. An example of exceeding arbitral authority might be awarding one party to a dispute the personal automobile of the other party when the dispute concerns the specific performance of a business-related contract.

It is open to the parties to restrict the possible awards that the abitrator can make. If this restriction requires a straight choice between the position of one party or the position of the other, then it is known as ''[[pendulum arbitration]]'' or ''final offer arbitration''. It is designed to encourage the parties to moderate their initial positions so as to make it more likely they receive a favourable decision.

No definitive statement can be made concerning the credentials or experience levels of arbitrators, although some jurisdictions have elected to establish standards for arbitrators in certain fields. Several independent organizations, such as the [[American Arbitration Association]] and the [[National Arbitration Forum]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adrforum.com National Arbitration Forum&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; offer arbitrator training programs and thus in effect, credentials. Generally speaking, however, the credibility of an arbitrator rests upon reputation, experience level in arbitrating particular issues, or expertise/experience in a particular field. Arbitrators are generally not required to be members of the legal profession.

To ensure effective arbitration and to increase the general credibility of the arbitral process, arbitrators will sometimes sit as a panel, usually consisting of three arbitrators. Often the three consist of an expert in the legal area within which the dispute falls (such as contract law in the case of a dispute over the terms and conditions of a contract), an expert in the industry within which the dispute falls (such as the construction industry, in the case of a dispute between a homeowner and his general contractor), and an experienced arbitrator.

==Umpire==
The umpire is a third party chosen either by the method of the arbitral parties or by a court&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|9|5}}&lt;/ref&gt; to render an independent decision usually in labour disputes when the arbitrators disagree on something. Umpire is another word for &quot;arbitrator&quot; or an arbitrator appointed to resolve an arbitration when the arbitrators can't agree.&lt;ref&gt;[http://definitions.uslegal.com/u/umpire/ Umpire&quot; USlegal.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Critics of arbitration argue that contractual requirements to arbitrate can be unfair to employees or consumers who have no power to negotiate what is often a boilerplate form contract; legally, these are called adhesion contracts. In these cases, the choice of arbiter may be spelled out in a contract. The arbitration panel may contain industry experts who may be more sympathetic to the industry than to the individual.

Also, some have argued that the fact that an arbitration institute may handle many cases for a corporation while an individual rarely goes through arbitration twice may bias the arbitrators in favor of the company. The Christian Science Monitor found that the National Arbitration Forum's 10 most frequently used arbitrators – who decided almost 60 percent of the consumer-related cases heard by the National Arbitration Forum – decided in favor of the consumer only 1.6 percent of the time.&lt;ref&gt;''Consumer advocates slam credit-card arbitration'', Simone Baribeau, Christian Science Monitor, July 16, 2007 at http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0716/p13s01-wmgn.html&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2009, the [[National Arbitration Forum]] agreed to exit the consumer arbitration market as part of a settlement with the Attorney General of Minnesota, after it was revealed that some debt collection companies were both owners of the organization and parties to disputes decided by it.

The fact that most arbitral procedures are not public, and that there may be no provision for an individual to be represented by counsel, may also work to the disadvantage of the individual. These potential disadvantages make the ethics and professionalism of arbitrators even more important.

Arbitration in the U.S. has also been criticized because of the unavailability of appellate review. Although the New York and federal arbitration laws were based on the English arbitration law of 1898, they omitted the English provision permitting for de novo review of questions of law. Thus, American courts can overturn arbitral rulings only for extremely gross procedural errors that violate [[due process]], but cannot reverse most substantive errors.

Unlike judicial opinions, arbitration opinions are often confidential. As a result, the law relating to activities (such as reinsurance contracts and certain types of securities industry disputes) where contracts to arbitrate are widespread may develop more slowly because the usual process of creating [[precedent]] is not available.

Critics say arbitration can mean high filing fees, unqualified arbitrators, lost legal rights, limited awards and no appeals. Filing a case in state Superior Court costs from $90 to $185, depending on the amount claimed. Filing fees for arbitration can cost thousands of dollars, depending on the case and the arbitration firm. Fees for hearing rooms and the arbitrator's time can run tens of thousands of dollars more and discourage individuals from pursuing a case.

In court, Judges or other judicial officers hear cases. Many arbitrators are former judges, but some are not even lawyers{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}. Arbitrators are rarely required to follow the law and are regulated in only two states. Judges are usually assigned according to a rotation or by a presiding judge. Parties select arbitrators, usually from a list compiled by an arbitration firm. Firms offer parties various methods of striking names from the list and reducing them to one. If the parties cannot agree, the firm may designate an arbitrator.

In courts, the right to a fair process is protected by legal safeguards such as discovery, testimony and evidence rules. Court rules do not apply to arbitration, meaning the arbitrator - sometimes guided by an arbitration agreement or the rules of an arbitration firm - controls the process.

Arbitration awards are generally lower than in court, and arbitration agreements sometimes limit the type of damages an individual can recover.

Judges' decisions are public record and subject to appeal. Most decisions by arbitrators are confidential. They cannot be appealed and are subject to judicial review only in narrow circumstances.

Critics say many arbitrators &quot;[[Judgment of Solomon|cut the baby in half]]&quot; irrespective of the merits of the parties' cases.

==Arbitration on TV==
The &quot;judge shows&quot; that have become popular in many countries, especially the [[United States]], are actually binding arbitration. The most famous example is ''[[The People's Court]]''. [[Judge Judy]] is another one.

== Arbitration Fairness Act ==

Most recently Senators [[Russ Feingold]] of [[Wisconsin]] and Congressman [[Hank Johnson]] of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], together with numerous co-sponsors in both Houses, introduced the Arbitration Fairness Act (S. 1782, H.R. 3010) in the [[U.S. Congress]]. The [[Bill (proposed law)|bill]] would prohibit mandatory pre-dispute binding arbitration in consumer, employment, and franchise disputes.  Parties to a dispute would still be able to choose arbitration over court if they wanted to, but individuals would be given a choice in the matter and would not be denied their constitutional right to access the courts and have a jury trial.  The bill would overturn the strong presumption in favor of arbitrability that has been erected by decisions of the United States Supreme Court under the rubric of the Federal Arbitration Act, at least as applied to consumer and employment disputes. The bill is supported by the groups such as Public Citizen, Center for Responsible Lending, Consumer Federation of America, Homeowners of Texas, Homeowners Against Deficient Dwellings, Home Owners for Better Building, National Association of Consumer Advocates, [[National Consumer Law Center]], National Consumer Coalition for Nursing Home Reform, National Employment Lawyers Association, and [[American Association for Justice]]. Opposition to the bill is led by the [[U.S. Chamber of Commerce]]'s [[Institute for Legal Reform]].

Among other things, the proposed Act states that: &quot;No predispute arbitration agreement shall be valid or enforceable if it requires arbitration of— (1) an employment, consumer, or franchise dispute; or (2) a dispute arising under any statute intended to protect civil rights or to regulate contracts or transactions between parties of unequal bargaining power.&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''adversarial system''' (or '''adversary system''') is a legal system where two advocates represent their parties' positions before an impartial person or group of people, usually a [[jury]] or [[judge]], who attempt to determine the truth of the case.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hale&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Hale|first=Sandra Beatriz|title= The Discourse of Court Interpreting: Discourse Practices of the Law, the Witness and the Interpreter |publisher=John Benjamins|date=July 2004|pages=p31|isbn=978-1-58811-517-1|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=HVwg_sQ5a5UC&amp;pg=PA31&amp;dq=%22adversarial+system%22&amp;ei=fGhVSILPMYGkiwH299T_Cw&amp;sig=g5PkkVnAsmlpSmh8ykvTGs3Bfb4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Richards&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Richards|first=Edward P. |coauthors=Katharine C.

The adversarial system is generally adopted in [[common law]] countries. An exception, for instance in the U.S., may be made for minor violations, such as [[Regulatory offences|traffic offenses]]. On the continent of [[Europe]] among some [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] systems (i.e. those deriving from [[Roman law]] or the [[Napoleonic code|Napoleonic Code]]), the [[inquisitorial system]] may be used for some types of cases.

The adversarial system is the two-sided structure under which [[Criminal procedure|criminal trial]] courts operate that pits the prosecution against the defense. Justice is done when the most effective adversary is able to convince the judge or jury that his or her perspective on the case is the correct one.

==History of the adversarial process==
Some writers trace the process to the medieval mode of [[trial by combat]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.proquest.com/ |title=Maintaining the adversarial system: The practice of allowing jurors to question witnesses during trial |author=Kirsten DeBarba |year=2002 |work= |page=55 no. 5 (October 1): 1521–1548 |publisher=Vanderbilt Law Review |accessdate=August 15, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anne Strick, ''Injustice for All'' (New York: [[G. P. Putnam's Sons]], 1977): 21.&lt;/ref&gt; in which some litigants, notably women, were allowed a champion to represent them. The use of the [[jury]] in the common law system seems to have fostered the adversarial system and provides the opportunity of both sides to argue their point of view.

==Basic features==
As an accused is not compelled to give evidence in a [[crime|criminal]] adversarial proceeding, he may not be questioned by prosecutor or judge unless he chooses to do so. However, should he decide to testify, he is subject to [[cross-examination]] and could be found guilty of [[perjury]]. As the election to maintain an accused person's [[right to silence]] prevents any examination or cross-examination of that person's position, it follows that the decision of counsel as to what evidence will be called is a crucial tactic in any case in the adversarial system and hence it might be said that it is a lawyer's manipulation of the truth. Certainly, it requires the skills of counsel on both sides to be fairly equally pitted and subjected to an impartial judge.

By contrast, while [[defendant]]s in most civil law systems can be compelled to give a statement, this statement is not subject to cross-examination by the prosecutor and not given under oath. This allows the defendant to explain his side of the case without being subject to cross-examination by a skilled opposition. However, this is mainly because it is not the prosecutor but the judges who question the defendant. The concept of &quot;cross&quot;-examination is entirely due to adversarial structure of the common law.

Judges in an adversarial system are impartial in ensuring the fair play of [[due process]], or [[fundamental justice]]. Such judges decide, often when called upon by counsel rather than of their own motion, what [[evidence (law)|evidence]] is to be admitted when there is a dispute; though in some common law jurisdictions judges play more of a role in deciding what evidence to admit into the record or reject. At worst, abusing [[judicial discretion]] would actually pave the way to a biased decision rendering obsolete the judicial process in question&amp;mdash;[[rule of law]] being illicitly subordinated by [[rule of man]] under such discriminating circumstances.

The [[rules of evidence]] are also developed based upon the system of objections of adversaries and on what basis it may tend to prejudice the [[trier of fact]] which may be the judge or the jury. In a way the rules of evidence can function to give a judge limited inquisitorial powers as the judge may exclude evidence he/she believes is not trustworthy or irrelevant to the legal issue at hand.

As said by Judge [[Megan L.A Brown]] all evidence must be relevant and not hearsay evidence.

Peter Murphy in his ''Practical Guide to Evidence'' recounts an instructive example. A frustrated judge in an English (adversarial) court finally asked a barrister after witnesses had produced conflicting accounts, 'Am I never to hear the truth?' 'No, my lord, merely the evidence', replied counsel.

The name &quot;adversarial system&quot; may be misleading in that it implies it is only within this type of system in which there are opposing prosecution and defense. This is not the case, and both modern adversarial and inquisitorial systems have the powers of the state separated between a prosecutor and the judge and allow the defendant the right to counsel. Indeed, the [[European Convention on Human Rights|European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms]] in Article 6 requires these features in the legal systems of its signatory states.

The right to counsel in criminal trials was initially not accepted in some adversarial systems. It was believed that the facts should speak for themselves, and that lawyers would just blur the matters. As a consequence, it was only in 1836 that England allowed suspects of felonies the right to have legal counsel (the [[Prisoners' Counsel Act 1836]]). In the United States, however, personally retained counsel have had a right to appear in all federal criminal cases since the adoption of the Constitution and in state cases at least since the end of the Civil War, although nearly all provided this right in their state constitutions or laws much earlier. Appointment of counsel for indigent defendants was nearly universal in federal felony cases, though it varied considerably in state cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.law.cornell.edu/anncon/html/amdt6frag7_user.html#amdt6_hd36 |title=CRS/LII Annotated Constitution Sixth Amendment |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until 1963 that the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] declared that legal counsel must be provided at the expense of the state for indigent felony defendants, under the federal Sixth Amendment, in state courts. See ''[[Gideon v. Wainwright]]'', {{ussc|372|335|1963}}.

One of the most significant differences between the adversarial system and the inquisitorial system occurs when a criminal defendant admits to the crime. In an adversarial system, there is no more controversy and the case proceeds to sentencing; though in many jurisdictions the defendant must have [[allocution]] of her or his crime, a false confession will not be accepted even in common law courts. By contrast, in an inquisitiorial system, the fact that the defendant has confessed is merely one more fact that is entered into evidence, and a confession by the defendant does not remove the requirement that the prosecution present a full case. This allows for [[plea bargain]]ing in adversarial systems in a way that is difficult or impossible in inquisitional system, and many felony cases in the United States are handled without trial through such plea bargains.

Another difference is in the rules of evidence. Because the adversarial system assumes that the evidence is to be presented to laymen rather than to jurists, the rules of evidence are considerably more strict. Rules on [[hearsay]] are much stricter in most adversarial systems than in inquisitorial systems; though often lower tribunals are allowed some flexibility in applying the strict rules of common law evidence such as in [[Family court|Domestic Relations Courts]] or in [[small claims court|small claims]] proceedings where the parties are often unrepresented by lawyers and the judge functions as more of an inquisitor to protect the interests of children than a neutral arbiter of justice.

In some adversarial legislative systems, the court is permitted to make [[inference]]s on an accused's failure to face [[cross-examination]] or to answer a particular question. This obviously limits the usefulness of silence as a tactic by the defence. In England the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 allowed such inferences to be made for the first time in England and Wales (it was already possible in Scotland under the [[rule of criminative circumstances]]). This change was disparaged by critics as an end to the 'right to silence', though in fact an accused still has the right to remain silent and cannot be compelled to take the stand. In the [[United States]], the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] has been interpreted to prohibit a jury from drawing a negative inference based on the defendant's invocation of his right not to testify, and the jury must be so instructed if the defendant requests.

==Comparisons with the inquisitorial approach==
{{Refimprove|date=August 2009}}
In many jurisdictions the approaches of each system are often formal differences in the way cases are reviewed. It is questionable that the results would be different if cases were conducted under the differing approaches; in fact no statistics exist that can show whether or not these systems would come to the same results. However, these approaches are often a matter of national pride and there are opinions amongst jurists about the merits of the differing approaches and their drawbacks as well.

Proponents of the adversarial system often argue that the system is more fair and less prone to abuse than the inquisitional approach, because it allows less room for the state to be biased against the defendant. It also allows most private litigants to settle their disputes in an amicable manner through discovery and pre-trial settlements in which non-contested facts are agreed upon and not dealt with during the trial process.

In addition, adversarial procedure defenders argue that the inquisitorial court systems are overly institutionalized and removed from the average citizen. The common law trial lawyer has ample opportunity to uncover the truth in a laboratory called the courtroom. Most cases that go to trial are carefully prepared through a discovery process that aids in the review of evidence and testimony before it is presented to judge or jury. The lawyers involved have a very good idea of the scope of agreement and disagreement of the issues to present at trial which develops much in the same way as the role of investigative judges. It has also been argued that a trial by a jury of one's peers may be more impartial than any government paid inquisitor and a panel of his peers. In the United States the right to a trial by a jury of one's peers who are common citizens is guaranteed by the United States Constitution.

Proponents of inquisitorial justice dispute these points. They point out that most cases in adversarial systems are actually resolved by [[plea bargain]] and [[Settlement (litigation)|settlement]]. Plea bargain as a system does not exist in inquisitorial system. Most legal cases in adversarial systems do not go to trial; this can lead to great injustice when the defendant has an unskilled or overworked attorney, which is likely to be the case when the defendant is poor. In addition, proponents of inquisitorial systems argue that the plea bargain system causes the participants within the system to act in perverse ways, in that it encourages prosecutors to bring charges far in excess of what is warranted and defendants to plead guilty even when they believe that they are not. Furthermore, proponents of inquisitorial systems also argue that the power of the judge is limited by the use of lay assessors and that a panel of judges may not necessarily be more biased than a jury.

The adversarial system has also been attacked for failing to accurately resolve complex technical issue such as science, technology, or tax or accounting regulation. In the adversarial system, juries encounter such complex technical cases for the first time. This would lead to unjust outcomes for one or both of the litigating parties due to the lack of understanding of the evidence presented. In the inquisitorial system, the judge, though not an expert in each technical subject, would have gone through similar tax, forensic, or accounting related issues countless times, and is thus unlikely to be confused or manipulated. Moreover, verdict in inquisitional case must include written justification by judges. For this reason, when new evidence emerge, the defence and/or the prosecutor can make an appeal on the basis that the verdict was incorrectly reasoned. On the other hand, in adversarial system, neither defence nor prosecutor know the actual discussion which took place and the jury is sworn to secrecy. Therefore, the appeal once conviction occur, must be made on the basis that contest between the defence and the prosecutor was not fair, which from the perspective of inquisitional system, is not same as the matter of truth. 

Disadvantages of using a jury on criminal matters can include:
#Expensive to operate and extends the time taken to hear cases
#Jury service imposes an unfair economic and mental burden on those chosen to serve
#Competence of non-professionals is questionable as they are considered ‘amateurs’ in the face of the law
#Jurors can be unduly influenced by media coverage of their case
#Easily persuaded by good counsel
#Do not give reasons for their decisions (process is secret – no debate)
#Jurors have difficulty in assessing damages and analysing complex evidence

[[Image:AbanoCampanile.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Tower of St. Lorenzo Cathedral]]
'''Abano Terme''' (known as ''Abano Bagni'' until 1930) is a town and ''[[comune]]'' in the [[province of Padua]], in the [[Veneto]] region, [[Italy]], on the eastern slope of the [[Colli Euganei]]; it is 10 kilometers southwest by rail from [[Padua]]. Abano Terme's population is 19,062 (2001) (in 1901 it was only 4,556). 

The town's hot springs and mud baths are the main economic resource. The waters have a temperature of some 80°C.

==History==
The baths were known to the Romans as ''[[Aponus|Aponi]] fons'' or ''Aquae Patavinae''. A description of them is given in a letter of [[Theodoric the Great|Theodoric]], the king of the [[Ostrogoths]]. Some remains of the ancient baths have been discovered (S. Mandruzzato, ''Trattato dei Bagni d'Abano,'' Padua, 1789).  An oracle of [[Geryon]] lay near, and the so-called ''sortes Praenestinae'' (C.I.L. i., Berlin, 1863; 1438-1454), small bronze cylinders inscribed, and used as oracles, were perhaps found here in the 16th century.

The baths were destroyed by the Lombards in the 6th century, but they were rebuilt and enlarged when Abano became an autonomous [[medieval commune|comune]] in the 12th century and, again, in the late 14th century. The city was under the [[Republic of Venice]] from 1405 to 1797.

==Main sights==
*[[Abano Cathedral]], or the cathedral (''[[duomo]]'') of St. Lawrence. The current edifice was erected in 1780 over a pre-existing church which was allegedly destroyed by [[Cangrande della Scala]]. The bell tower has parts from the 9th/10th and 14th centuries.
*The Montirone Gallery, housing works of [[Il Moretto]], [[Palma the Younger]], [[Guido Reni]], [[Giandomenico Tiepolo]] and others.
*The Sanctuary of the ''Madonna della Salute'' or of Monteortone (built from 1428). It lies on the site where the Madonna appeared to Pietro Falco, healing his wounds. The church is on the Latin cross plan, with a nave and two aisles with three apses decorated by a frieze. It has with a Baroque portal (1667), a noteworthy bell tower, presbytery frescoes portraying the ''Histories of St. Peter'' and ''Virgin'' by [[Jacopo da Montagnana]] (1495) and [[Palma il Giovane|Palma the Younger]]'s altarpiece depicting ''Christ Crucifixed Between St. Augustine and St. Jerome''.

Just outside the city is San Daniele Abbey (11th century). 6&amp;nbsp;km from the city is also Praglia Abbey, founded in the 11th century by Benedictine monks and rebuilt in 1496-1550. The church of the Assumption, with a marble portal from 1548, has a Renaissance style interior. Noteworthy is the four cloister complex.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Abatis (PSF).png|thumb|right|Abatisses are used in war to keep the approaching enemy under fire for as long as possible.]]
'''Abatis''', '''abattis''', or '''abbattis''' is a term in field [[fortification]] for an obstacle formed (in the modern era) of the branches of trees laid in a row, with the sharpened tops directed outwards, towards the enemy. The trees are usually interlaced or tied with [[wire]]. Abatis are used alone or in combination with [[wire entanglement]]s and other obstacles.{{sfn|Anonymous|1911}}

There is evidence it was used as early as the [[Roman Empire|Roman Imperial]] period, and as recently as the [[American Civil War]]. Abatis is rarely seen nowadays, having been largely replaced by [[wire obstacle]]s. However, it may be used as a replacement or supplement when [[barbed wire]] is in short supply. A form of giant abatis, using whole trees instead of branches, can be used as an improvised anti-[[tank]] obstacle.

A classic use of an abatis was found at the [[Battle of the Chateauguay]], 26 October, 1813, when approximately 1,300 Canadian [[voltigeurs]], under the command of Charles-Michel de Salaberry, defeated an American corps of approximately 2,300 men.

An important weakness of abatis, in contrast to [[barbed wire]], is that it can be destroyed by [[fire]]. Also, if laced together with [[rope]] instead of [[wire]], the rope can be very quickly destroyed by such fires, after which the abatis can be quickly pulled apart by [[grappling hook]]s thrown from a safe distance.

An important advantage is that an improvised abatis can be quickly formed in forested areas. This can be done by simply cutting down a row of trees so that they fall with their tops toward the enemy. An alternative is to place explosives so as to blow the trees down.

[[Image:Abatis Map Symbol.svg|thumb|right|150px|United States military symbol for an abatis]]
Though rarely used by modern conventional military units, abatises are still officially maintained in [[United States Army]] and [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] training.  Current training instructs engineers or other constructors of such obstacles to fell trees, leaving a 1 or 2 yard stump, in such a manner as the trees fall interlocked pointing at a 45 degree angle towards the direction of approach of the enemy.  Furthermore, it is recommended that the trees remain connected to the stumps and the length of roadway covered be at least 80 yards. US military maps record an abatis by use of an inverted &quot;V&quot; with a short line extending from it to the right.&lt;ref&gt;[[United States Army]] and [[United States Marine Corps]], ''FM 101-5-1/MCRP 5-2A Operational Terms and Graphics'', 30 September 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Antoine Thomson d'Abbadie d'Arrast''' (January 3, 1810 – March 19, 1897) was a [[France|French]] and [[Basque people|Basque]] [[explorer]], [[geographer]], [[ethnologue]], [[linguist]] and [[astronomer]] notable for his travels in [[Ethiopia]] during the first half of the 19th century. He was the older brother of [[Arnaud Michel d'Abbadie]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Chambers Biographical Dictionary]], ISBN 0-550-18022-2, page 1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Born from a [[nobility|noble]] family of the [[Provinces of France|province]] of [[Soule]], his father Michel was born in [[Arrast-Larrebieu]] and his mother was [[Irish people|Irish]]. His grandfather Jean-Pierre was an [[abbot]] and a [[Notary public|notary]] in [[Soule]].
 
The family moved to [[France]] in 1818 where the brothers received a careful scientific education. 

At his return from Ethiopia, he married Virginie Vincent de Saint Bonnet in 1848, and settled in [[Hendaye]] where he purchased 250[[Hectare|ha]] to build his [[castle]], and became the mayor of the city from 1871 to 1875.

Abbadie was a knight of the [[Légion d’honneur|Legion of Honour]] and a member of the [[French Academy of Sciences]]. He died in 1897, and bequeathed the Abbadi domain and castle in Hendaye, yielding 40,000 francs a year, to the Academy of Sciences.

== Science and explorations ==
In 1835 the [[French Academy]] sent Antoine on a scientific mission to [[Brazil]], the results being published at a later date (1873) under the title of ''Observations relatives à la physique du globe faites au Bresil et en Ethiopie''. The younger Abbadie spent some time in [[Algeria]] before, in 1837, the two brothers started for Ethiopia, landing at [[Massawa]] in February 1838. They visited various parts of Ethiopia, including the then little-known districts of [[Ennarea]] and [[Kingdom of Kaffa|Kaffa]], sometimes together and sometimes separately. They met with many difficulties and many adventures, and became involved in political intrigues, Antoine especially exercising such influence as he possessed in favour of France and the [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] missionaries. After collecting much valuable information concerning the geography, geology, archaeology and natural history of Ethiopia, the brothers returned to France in 1848 and began to prepare their materials for publication.

Antoine became involved in various controversies relating both to his geographical results and his political intrigues. He was especially attacked by [[Charles Tilstone Beke]], who impugned his veracity, especially with reference to the journey to [[Kana, Ethiopia|Kana]]. But time and the investigations of subsequent explorers have shown that Abbadie was quite trustworthy as to his facts, though wrong in his contention—hotly contested by Beke—that the [[Blue Nile]] was the main stream. The topographical results of his explorations were published in [[Paris]] between 1860 and 1873 in ''Geodesie d'Ethiopie'', full of the most valuable information and illustrated by ten maps. Of the ''Geographie de l'Ethiopie'' (Paris, 1890) only one volume has been published. In ''Un Catalogue raisonné de manuscrits ethiopiens'' (Paris, 1859) is a description of 234 Ethiopian [[manuscript]]s collected by Antoine. He also compiled various vocabularies, including a ''Dictionnaire de [[Amharic language|la langue amariñña]]'' (Paris, 1881), and prepared an edition of the ''[[Shepherd of Hermas]]'', with the Latin version, in 1860. He published numerous papers dealing with the geography of Ethiopia, Ethiopian coins and ancient inscriptions. Under the title of ''Reconnaissances magnetiques'' he published in 1890 an account of the [[magnetic]] observations made by him in the course of several journeys to the [[Red Sea]] and the [[Levant]]. The general account of the travels of the two brothers was published by Arnaud in 1868 under the title of ''Douze ans dans la Haute Ethiopie''.
[[Image:Chateau d Abbadie.jpg|thumb|180px|right|&quot;Abbadia&quot;, [[Hendaye]], by [[Viollet-le-Duc]]]]
Both brothers received the grand medal of the [[Paris Geographical Society]] in 1850.

==Abbadie, a Basque and bascophile==

Basque through his father, Abbadie developed a particular interest about the [[Basque Language]] after meeting the Prince [[Louis Lucien Bonaparte]] in [[London]]. He started his academic work on Basque in 1852. 

A speaker of both [[Souletin]] and [[Lapurdian]], a resident of [[Lapurdi]], Abbadie considered himself a [[Basque people|Basque]] from [[Soule]].

The popularity of the [[motto]] [[Zazpiak Bat]] is attributed to Abbadie.

==Abbadie, an Irishman?==
Irish through his mother, Abbadie was an English-speaker but his relationship with Irish culture or his Irish family is not documented.

==The Castle==
Abbadie gave his domain the name ''Abbadia'', which is the name still used in Basque. However in [[French Language|French]] it is usually referred to as ''Chateau d'Abbadie'' or ''Domaine d'Abbadia'', and locally it is not unusual for it to be called ''le Chateau d'Antoine d'Abbadie''. 

The castle was built between 1864 and 1879 on a cliff by the Cantábrico sea, and was designed by [[Viollet Le Duc]] in the [[Neo Gothic]] style. It is divided in three parts : the observatory and library, the chapel and the living part.

Nowadays the castle still belongs to the [[Académie des sciences|Academy of Science]] to which it was bequeathed in 1895 on condition of its producing within fifty years a catalogue of half-a-million stars.

The castle was classified as a protected historical monument by France in 1984 and most of the domain now belongs to the [[Conservatoire du littoral|Coastal Protection Agency]] and is managed by the city of Hendaye.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Abba Mari ben Moses ben Joseph''', was a [[Provençal rabbi]], born at [[Lunel]], near [[Montpellier]], towards the end of the 13th century. He is also known as '''Yarhi''' from his birthplace ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] ''Yerah'', i.e. [[moon]], lune), and he further took the name '''Astruc''', '''Don Astruc''' or '''En Astruc of Lunel'''.

The descendant of men learned in [[rabbinic literature|rabbinic]] lore, Abba Mari devoted himself to the study of [[theology]] and [[philosophy]], and made himself acquainted with the writings of [[Maimonides|Moses Maimonides]] and [[Nachmanides]] as well as with the ''[[Talmud]]''.

In Montpellier, where he lived from 1303 to 1306, he was much distressed by the prevalence of [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] [[rationalism]], which in his opinion, through the medium of the works of Maimonides, threatened the authority of the [[Old Testament]], obedience to the law, and the belief in [[miracle]]s and [[revelation]]. He therefore, in a series of letters (afterwards collected under the title ''Minhat Kenaot'', i.e., &quot;Jealousy Offering&quot;) called upon the famous rabbi [[Solomon ben Adret]] of [[Barcelona]] to come to the aid of orthodoxy. Ben Adret, with the approval of other prominent Spanish rabbis, sent a letter to the community at Montpellier proposing to forbid the study of philosophy to those who were less than twenty-five years of age, and, in spite of keen opposition from the liberal section, a decree in this sense was issued by Ben Adret in 1305.  The result was a great schism among the [[Jew]]s of [[Spain]] and southern [[France]], and a new impulse was given to the study of philosophy by the unauthorized interference of the Spanish rabbis.

On the expulsion of the Jews from France by [[Philip IV of France|Philip IV]] in 1306, Abba Mari settled at [[Perpignan]], where he published the letters connected with the controversy. His subsequent history is unknown.  Beside the letters, he was the author of liturgical poetry and works on civil law.

==Defender of Law and Tradition==
(Graetz and others have, incorrectly, En Duran): Leader of the opposition to the [[rationalism]] of the Maimonists in the Montpellier controversy of 1303-1306; born at Lunel—hence his name, Yarḥi (from Yeraḥ = Moon = Lune). He was a descendant of [[Meshullam ben Jacob]] of Lunel, one of whose five sons was Joseph, the grandfather of Abba Mari, who, like his son Moses, the father of Abba Mari, was highly respected for both his rabbinical learning and his general erudition. Abba Mari moved to Montpellier, where, to his chagrin, he found the study of rabbinical lore greatly neglected by the young, who devoted all of their time and zeal to [[science]] and [[philosophy]]. The rationalistic method pursued by the new school of Maimonists (including [[Levi ben Abraham ben Chayyim]] of [[Villefranche-de-Conflent|Villefranche]], near the town of [[Perpignan]], and [[Jacob Anatolio]]) especially provoked his indignation; for the sermons preached and the works published by them seemed to resolve the entire [[Scripture]]s into [[allegory]] and threatened to undermine the Jewish faith and the observance of the Law and tradition. He was not without some philosophical training. He mentions even with reverence the name of Maimonides, whose work he possessed and studied; but he was more inclined toward the mysticism of Nachmanides. Above all, he was a thorough believer in [[revelation]] and in a [[divine providence]], and was a sincere, law-observing follower of rabbinical Judaism. He would not allow Aristotle, &quot;the searcher after God among the heathen,&quot; to be ranked with Moses.

==Opponent of Rationalism==
Abba Mari possessed considerable Talmudic knowledge and some poetical talent; but his zeal for the Law made him an agitator and a persecutor of all the advocates of liberal thought. Being himself without sufficient authority, he appealed in a number of letters, afterward published under the title of ''Minḥat Ḳenaot'' (''Jealousy Offering''), to [[Solomon ben Adret]] of [[Barcelona]], the most influential rabbi of the time, to use his powerful authority to check the source of evil by hurling his [[anathema]] against both the study of philosophy and the allegorical interpretations of the Bible, which did away with all belief in miracles. Ben Adret, while reluctant to interfere in the affairs of other congregations, was in perfect accord with Abba Mari as to the danger of the new rationalistic systems, and advised him to organize the conservative forces in defense of the Law. Abba Mari, through Ben Adret's aid, obtained allies eager to take up his cause, among whom were Don [[Bonafoux Vidal]] of Barcelona and his brother, Don [[Crescas Vidal]], then in Perpignan. The proposition of the latter to prohibit, under penalty of [[excommunication]], the study of philosophy and any of the sciences except [[medicine]], by one under thirty years of age, met with the approval of Ben Adret. Accordingly, Ben Adret addressed to the congregation of Montpellier a letter, signed by fifteen other rabbis, proposing to issue a decree pronouncing the anathema against all those who should pursue the study of philosophy and science before due maturity in age and in rabbinical knowledge. On a Sabbath in September, 1304, the letter was to be read before the congregation, when [[Jacob Machir Don Profiat Tibbon]], the renowned astronomical and mathematical writer, entered his protest against such unlawful interference by the Barcelona rabbis, and a [[Schism (religion)|schism]] ensued. Twenty-eight members signed Abba Mari's letter of approval; the others, under Tibbon's leadership, addressed another letter to Ben Adret, rebuking him and his colleagues for condemning a whole community without knowledge of the local conditions. Finally, the agitation for and against the liberal ideas brought about a schism in the entire Jewish population in southern [[France]] and [[Spain]].

Encouraged, however, by letters signed by the rabbis of [[Argentière]] and Lunel, and particularly by the support of [[Kalonymus ben Todros]], the ''[[nasi]]'' of [[Narbonne]], and of the eminent Talmudist [[Asheri of Toledo]], Ben Adret issued a decree, signed by thirty-three rabbis of Barcelona, excommunicating those who should, within the next fifty years, study [[physics]] or [[metaphysics]] before their thirtieth year of age (basing his action on the principle laid down by Maimonides, ''Guide for the Perplexed'' part one chapter 34), and had the order promulgated in the synagogue on Sabbath, July 26, 1305. When this [[heresy]]-decree, to be made effective, was forwarded to other congregations for approval, the friends of liberal thought, under the leadership of the Tibbonites, issued a counter-ban, and the conflict threatened to assume a serious character, as blind party zeal (this time on the liberal side) did not shrink from asking the civil powers to intervene. But an unlooked-for calamity brought the warfare to an end. The expulsion of the Jews from France by [[Philip IV of France|Philip IV]] (&quot;the Fair&quot;), in , caused the Jews of Montpellier to take refuge, partly in [[Provence]], partly in Perpignan and partly in [[Majorca]]. Consequently, Abba Mari removed first to [[Arles]], and, within the same year, to Perpignan, where he finally settled and disappeared from public view. There he published his correspondence with Ben Adret and his colleagues.

==His Works==
Abba Mari collected the correspondence and added to each letter a few explanatory notes. Of this collection, called ''Minḥat Ḳenaot,'' there are several manuscript copies extant; namely, at [[Oxford]] (Neubauer, ''Cat. Bodl. Hebr. MSS.,'' Nos. 2182 and 2221); [[Paris]], Bibl. Nat. No. 976; Günzburg Libr., [[Saint Petersburg]]; [[Parma]]; [[Ramsgate]] [[Montefiore College]] Library (formerly Halberstam, No. 192); and [[Turin]]. Some of these (Oxford, No. 2221, and Paris, Bibl. Nat.) are mere fragments. The printed edition (Presburg, 1838), prepared by M. L. Bislichis, contains: (1) Preface; (2) a treatise of eighteen chapters on the [[incorporeality]] of [[God]]; (3) correspondence; (4) a treatise, called ''Sefer ha-Yarḥi,'' included also in letter 58; (5) a defense of ''The Guide'' and its author by [[Shem-Tob Palquera]] (Grätz, ''Gesch. d. Juden,'' vii. 173). As the three cardinal doctrines of Judaism, Abba Mari accentuates: (1) That of the recognition of God's existence and of His absolute sovereignty, eternity, unity, and incorporeality, as taught in revelation, especially in the ''[[Ten Commandments|Decalogue]]''; (2) that of the world's creation by Him out of nothing, as evidenced particularly by the Sabbath; (3) that of the special [[Divine providence|providence]] of God, as manifested in the Biblical [[miracle]]s. In the preface, Abba Mari explains his object in collecting the correspondence; and in the treatise which follows he shows that the study of philosophy, useful in itself as a help toward the acquisition of the knowledge of God, requires great caution, lest we be misled by the Aristotelian philosophy or its false interpretation, as regards the principles of creation ''[[ex nihilo]]'' and divine individual providence. The manuscripts include twelve letters which are not included in the printed edition of ''Minḥat Ḳenaot.''

==Contents of the ''Minḥat Ḳenaot''==
The correspondence refers mainly to the proposed restriction of the study of the Aristotelian philosophy. Casually, other theological questions are discussed. For example, letters 1, 5, and 8 contain a discussion on the question, whether the use of a piece of metal with the figure of a lion, as a [[amulet|talisman]], is permitted by Jewish law for medicinal purposes, or is prohibited as [[idolatry|idolatrous]]. In letter 131, Abba Mari mourns the death of Ben Adret, and in letter 132 he sends words of sympathy to the congregation of Perpignan, on the death of Don Vidal Shlomo (the [[Meiri]]) and Rabbi Meshullam. Letter 33 contains the statement of Abba Mari that two letters which he desired to insert could not be discovered by him. MS. Ramsgate, No. 52, has the same statement, but also the two letters missing in the printed copies. In the ''Sefer ha-Yarḥi'', Abba Mari refers to the great caution shown by the rabbis of old as regards the teaching of the mysteries of philosophy, and recommended by men like the [[Hai Gaon]], Maimonides, and [[David Kimhi]]. A response of Abba Mari on a ritual question is contained in MS. Ramsgate, No. 136; and Zunz (''Literaturgeschichte der Synagogalen Poesie,'' p.&amp;nbsp;498), mentions a ''ḳinah'' composed by Abba Mari.

The ''Minḥat Ḳenaot'' is instructive reading for the historian because it throws much light upon the deeper problems which agitated Judaism, the question of the relation of religion to the philosophy of the age, which neither the zeal of the fanatic nor the bold attitude of the liberal-minded could solve in any fixed dogmatic form or by any anathema, as the independent spirit of the congregations refused to accord to the rabbis the power possessed by the Church of dictating to the people what they should believe or respect. At the close of the work are added several eulogies written by Abba Mari on Ben Adret (who died in 1310), and on Don Vidal, [[Solomon of Perpignan]], and Don [[Bonet Crescas]] of Lunel.

HH '''Abbas II Hilmi''' '''Bey''' (also known as '''Abbas Hilmi [[Pasha]]''') ({{lang-ar|&lt;big&gt;عباس حلمي باشا&lt;/big&gt;}}) (14 July 1874 &amp;ndash; 19 December 1944) was the last [[Khedive]] of [[Egypt]] and [[Sudan]] (8 January 1892 &amp;ndash; 19 December 1914).&lt;ref&gt;[[Chambers Biographical Dictionary]], ISBN 0-550-18022-2, page 1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Abbas II was the great-great-grandson of [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]]. He succeeded his father, [[Tewfik Pasha]], as [[Khedive]] of Egypt and Sudan. As a boy he visited the United Kingdom, and he had a British tutor for some time in [[Cairo]]. He then went to school in [[Lausanne]], and from there passed on to the [[Theresian Military Academy|Theresianum]] in [[Vienna]]. In addition to [[Arabic]] and [[Turkish language|Turkish]], he had good conversational knowledge of English, French and German.

==Reign==
He was still in college in Vienna when he assumed the throne of the [[Khedivate of Egypt]] upon the sudden death of his father. He was barely of age according to Egyptian law; eighteen in cases of succession to the throne. For some time he did not cooperate very cordially with the United Kingdom, whose army had occupied Egypt in 1882. As he was young and eager to exercise his new power, he resented the interference of the British Agent and Consul General in Cairo, Sir [[Evelyn Baring, 1st Earl of Cromer|Evelyn Baring]], later made [[Earl of Cromer|Lord Cromer]]. At the outset of his reign, Khedive Abbas surrounded himself with a coterie of European advisers who opposed the British occupation of Egypt and Sudan and encouraged the young Khedive to challenge Cromer by replacing his ailing prime minister with a nationalist. At Cromer's behest, Lord Roseberry, the British foreign secretary, sent him a letter stating that the Khedive was obliged to consult the British consul on such issues as cabinet appointments. In January 1894 Abbas, while on an inspection tour of Egyptian army installations near the southern border, the Mahdists being at the time still in control of Sudan, made public remarks disparaging the Egyptian army units commanded by British officers. The British commander of the Egyptian army, Sir [[Herbert Kitchener]], immediately offered to resign. Cromer strongly supported Kitchener and pressed the Khedive and prime minister to retract the Khedive's criticisms of the British officers. From that time on, Abbas no longer publicly opposed the British, but secretly created, supported, and sustained the nationalist movement, which came to be led by [[Mustafa Kamil]]. As Kamil's thrust was increasingly aimed at winning popular support for a National Party, Khedive Abbas publicly distanced himself from the Nationalists.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

In time he came to accept British counsels. In 1899 British diplomat [[Alfred Mitchell-Innes]] was appointed Under-Secretary of State for Finance in Egypt, and in 1900 Abbas paid a second visit to Britain, during which he frankly acknowledged the great good the British had done in Egypt, and declared himself ready to follow their advice and to cooperate with the British officials administering Egyptian and Sudanese affairs. The establishment of a sound system of native justice, the great remission of taxation, the reconquest of  [[Sudan]], the inauguration of the substantial irrigation works at [[Aswan]], and the increase of cheap, sound education, each received his formal approval. He displayed more interest in [[agriculture]] than in statecraft. His farm of cattle and horses at [[Qubbah]], near Cairo, was a model for [[scientific farming|scientific agriculture]] in Egypt, and he created a similar establishment at [[Montaza Palace|Muntazah]], near [[Alexandria]]. He married the Princess [[Ikbal Hanem]] and had several children. [[Prince Muhammad Abdul Moneim|Muhammad Abdul Mun'im]], the heir-apparent, was born on 20 February 1899.

His relations with Cromer's successor, Sir Eldon Gorst, were excellent, and they co-operated in appointing the cabinets headed by [[Boutros Ghali|Butrus Ghali]] in 1908 and [[Muhammad Said Pasha|Muhammad Sa'id]] in 1910 and in checking the power of the Nationalist Party. The appointment of Kitchener to succeed Gorst in 1911 displeased Abbas, and relations between him and the British deteriorated. Kitchener often complained about &quot;that wicked little Khedive&quot; and wanted to depose him.

When the [[Ottoman Empire]] joined the [[Central Powers]] in [[World War I]], the United Kingdom declared Egypt an independent Sultanate under British [[protectorate]] on 18 December 1914 and deposed Abbas. Abbas supported the Ottomans in the war, including leading an attack on the Suez Canal. His uncles [[Hussein Kamel of Egypt|Hussein Kamel]] and then [[Fuad I]], the British choices for their Protectorate, issued a series of restrictive orders to strip Abbas of property in Egypt and Sudan and forbade contributions to him. These also barred Abbas from entering Egyptian territory and stripped him of the right to sue in Egyptian courts. Abbas finally accepted the new order of things on 12 May 1931 and abdicated. He retired to Switzerland where he died at Geneva 19 December 1944.

==Marriages and issue==
He married firstly in [[Cairo]] on 19 February 1895 [[Crimean Tatars|Crimean]] Ikbal Hanim ([[Crimea]], 22 October 1876 - [[Jerusalem]], 10 February 1941) and had six children:
* HH Princess Emine Hilmi Khanum Efendi ([[Montaza Palace]], [[Alexandria]], 12 February 1895 - 1954), unmarried and without issue
* HH Princess Atiye Hilmi Khanum Efendi ([[Cairo]], 9 June 1896 - 1971), unmarried and without issue

* HH Prince/HRH [[Prince Muhammad Abdel Moneim]] Bey Efendi, Heir Apparent and [[Regent]] of [[Egypt]] and [[Sudan]]
* HH Princess Lütfiye Şevket Hilmi ([[Cairo]], 29 September 1900 - ?), married in [[Istanbul]] on 5 May 1923 to Omar Muhtar Katırcıoğlu (1902 - Çamlıca, near [[Üsküdar]], [[Bosphorus]], 15 July 1935), and had issue:
** ''Emine Neşedil Katırcıoğlu (b. 1927), unmarried and without issue''
** ''Zehra Kadriye Katırcıoğlu (b. 1929), married Ahmet Cevat Tugay have 4 sons and a daughter''
* HH Prince Muhammed Abdel Kader (4 February 1902 - [[Montreux]], 21 April 1919)

He married secondly at Çubuklu, [[Bosphorus]], on 1 March 1910 and divorced in 1913 [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] [[Noblewoman]] [[May Torok von Szendro|Marianne Török de Szendrö]], who took the name Zübeyde Cavidan Hanım ([[Philadelphia]], [[Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia County]], [[Pennsylvania]], 8 January 1874 - aft. 1951), without issue.

[[Prince]], [[Field-Marshal]] '''Abbas Mirza ''' (عباس میرزا in [[Persian language|Persian]]) (August 26, 1789 - October 25, 1833), was a [[Qajar]] [[crown prince]] of [[Iran|Persia]]. He developed a reputation as a military commander during wars with [[Russia]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Chambers Biographical Dictionary]], ISBN 0-550-18022-2, page 1&lt;/ref&gt; as an early modernizer of [[Persia]]'s armed forces and institutions, and for his death before his father, [[Fath Ali Shah]]. Abbas was an intelligent prince, possessed some literary taste, and is noteworthy on account of the comparative simplicity of his life.

==Biography==
He was a younger son of [[Fath Ali Shah]], but on account of his mother's royal birth was destined by his father to succeed him. Entrusted with the government of a part of Persia, he sought to rule it in European fashion, and employed officers to reorganize his army. He was soon at war with Russia, and his aid was eagerly solicited by both [[England]] and [[Napoleon]], anxious to checkmate one another in the East. Preferring the friendship of [[France]], Abbas Mirza continued the war against Russia's [[General Kotlyarevsky]], but his new ally could give him very little assistance. Kotlyarevsky defeated the numerically superior Persian army in the [[Battle of Aslanduz]] and in October, 1813, Persia was compelled to make a disadvantageous peace, ceding some territory in the [[Caucasus]] (present-day [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Dagestan]], and most of the [[Republic of Azerbaijan]]).

He gained some victories during the war 1821 war between the Ottoman Empire and Persia, resulting in a peace treaty signed in 1823 after the [[Battle of Erzurum]]. The war was a victory for Persia. His [[Russo-Persian War, 1826-1828|second war with Russia]], which began in 1826, ended in a string of costly defeats after which Persia was forced to cede nearly all of its [[Armenia]]n territories and [[Nakhchivan]]. When the peace treaty was signed in February, 1828, Abbas Mirza sought to restore order in the province of [[Khorasan (Province)|Khorasan]], which was nominally under Persian supremacy, and while engaged in the task died at [[Mashhad]] in 1833. In 1834 his eldest son, [[Mohammed Mirza]], succeeded [[Fath Ali Shah]] as the next king.  R. G. Watson (History of Persia, 128-9) describes him as “the noblest of the Kajar race”.&lt;ref&gt;Lockhart, L. &quot;Abbas Mirza.&quot; Encyclopaedia of Islam. Edited by: P. Bearman , Th. Bianquis , C.E. Bosworth , E. van Donzel and W.P. Heinrichs. Brill, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

He is most remembered for his valor in battle and his failed attempts to modernize the Persian army. He was not successful in part due to the lack of government centralization in Iran during the era. Furthermore, it was Abbas Mirza who first dispatched Iranian students to Europe for a western education.&lt;ref&gt;[[Patrick Clawson]] and [[Michael Rubin (historian)|Michael Rubin]].

==Biography==
===Early years===
Born at [[Guildford]] in [[Surrey]], where his father ''Maurice Abbot'' (died 1606) was a cloth-worker,&lt;ref name=&quot;CBD&quot; /&gt; he was taught at the [[Royal Grammar School, Guildford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/4?docPos=1 |work=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography |title=George Abbot (bishop)}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later studied, and then taught, at [[Balliol College, Oxford]], was chosen Master of [[University College, Oxford|University College]] in 1597, and appointed [[Dean (religion)|Dean]] of [[Winchester Cathedral|Winchester]] in 1600. He was three times [[Vice-Chancellor]] of the [[University of Oxford|University]], and took a leading part in preparing the authorised version of the [[New Testament]]. In 1608, he went to [[Scotland]] with [[George Home, 1st Earl of Dunbar]] to arrange for a union between the churches of England and Scotland. He so pleased [[James I of England|King James]] in this affair that he was made [[Bishop of Lichfield and Coventry]] in 1609 and was translated to the [[episcopal see|see]] of [[Bishop of London|London]] a month afterwards.

===Archbishop of Canterbury===
On 4 March 1611, Abbot was raised to the position of [[Archbishop of Canterbury|Canterbury]]. As archbishop, he defended the [[Apostolic Succession]] of the Anglican archbishops and bishops and the validity of the Church's priesthood in 1614. In consequence of the [[Nag's Head Fable]], the archbishop invited certain Roman Catholics to inspect the register in the presence of six of his own episcopal colleagues, the details of which inspection were preserved. It was agreed by all parties that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;The register agrees in every particular with what we know of the history of the times, and there exists not the semblance of a reason for pronouncing it a forgery.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper | author=John Wordsworth, D.D., Bishop of Salisbury | title=A Letter on the Succession of Bishops in the Church of England | url=http://anglicanhistory.org/england/jwords/heykamp.html | date=13 May 1890 | accessdate=5 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In spite of his defence of the Catholic nature of the priesthood, his [[puritan]] instincts frequently led him not only into harsh treatment of Roman Catholics, but also into courageous resistance to the royal will, e.g. when he opposed the scandalous divorce suit of the Lady [[Frances Howard]] against the [[Earl of Essex]], and again in 1618 when, at [[Croydon]], he forbade the reading of the declaration permitting [[Sunday sports]]. He was naturally, therefore, a promoter of the match between the [[elector palatine]], [[Frederick V, Elector Palatine|Frederick V]], and the [[Elizabeth of Bohemia|Princess Elizabeth]], and a firm opponent of the projected marriage of the [[Prince of Wales]] with the ''[[Infanta]]'' of Spain. This policy brought upon him the hatred of [[William Laud]] (with whom he had previously come into collision at Oxford) and the court, though the King himself never forsook him.

[[File:g abbot.jpg|thumb|right|thumb|150px|Abbot statue at [[Guildford]]]]

In 1622, while hunting in [[Edward la Zouche, 11th Baron Zouche|Lord Zouch]]'s park at [[Bramshill House|Bramshill]] in [[Hampshire]], a bolt from his cross-bow aimed at a deer happened to strike one of the keepers, who died within an hour, and Abbot was so greatly distressed by the event that he fell into a state of settled [[melancholia]]. His enemies maintained that the fatal issue of this accident disqualified him for his office, and argued that, though the [[homicide]] was involuntary, the sport of hunting which had led to it was one in which no clerical person could lawfully indulge. The King had to refer the matter to a commission of ten, though he said that &quot;an angel might have miscarried after this sort.&quot; The commission was equally divided, and the King gave a casting vote in the Archbishop's favour, though signing also a formal pardon or dispensation.

After this the Archbishop seldom appeared at the Council, chiefly on account of his infirmities. In 1625 he attended the King constantly, however, in his last illness, and performed the ceremony of the coronation of [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]]. His refusal to license the [[assize sermon]] preached by Dr [[Robert Sibthorp]] at [[Northampton]] on 22 February 1627, in which cheerful obedience was urged to the king's demand for a general loan, and the duty proclaimed of absolute non-resistance even to the most arbitrary royal commands, led Charles to deprive him of his functions as [[primate (religion)|primate]], putting them in commission. The need of summoning parliament, however, soon brought about a nominal restoration of the Archbishop's powers. His presence being unwelcome at court, he lived from that time in retirement, leaving Laud and his party in undisputed ascendancy. He died at Croydon on 5 August 1633, and was buried at Guildford, his native place, where he had endowed a hospital with lands to the value of £300 a year.

==Legacy==
Abbot was a conscientious [[prelate]], though narrow in view and often harsh towards both separatists and Roman Catholics. He wrote a large number of works, the most interesting being his discursive ''Exposition on the Prophet Jonah'' (1600), which was reprinted in 1845. His ''Geography, or a Brief Description of the Whole World'' (1599), passed through numerous editions. The newest edition, edited by the current Master of the Abbot's Hospital, is to be published on 20th June 2011, to commemorate the 400th anniversary of his enthronement as Archbishop of Canterbury. 

Guildford remembers the Archbishop with his Hospital (www.abbotshospital.org) a statue in the High Street, a pub and also a secondary school ([[George Abbot School]]) named after him. His tomb can be seen in [[Holy Trinity Church, Guildford|Holy Trinity Church]].

'''Adware''', or '''advertising-supported software''', is any [[Computer software|software]] package which automatically plays, displays, or downloads advertisements to a computer. These advertisements can be in the form of a [[Pop-up ad|pop-up]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Internet and the Law: Technology, Society, and Compromises|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Fo2a7YtU1GUC&amp;pg=PA10&amp;dq=adware&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=nGh4TMeoGcaUnQfegfX3AQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=adware&amp;f=false|author=Aaron Schwabach|pages=10|isbn=978-1-85109-731-9|year=2005|publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The object of the Adware is to generate revenue for its author. Adware, by itself, is harmless; however, some adware may come with integrated [[spyware]] such as [[keylogger]]s and other [[privacy-invasive software]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MS-Enc-Sec&quot;&gt;{{cite book

 |quote = a software application in which advertisements are displayed while the program is running, esp. in pop-up windows or banners, and which often is installed without the user's knowledge or consent; also called advertising-supported software
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Application ==
Advertising functions are  integrated into or bundled with the software, which is often designed to note what Internet sites the user visits and to present advertising pertinent to the types of goods or services featured there. Adware is usually seen by the developer as a way to recover development costs, and in some cases it may allow the software to be provided to the user free of charge or at a reduced price. The income derived from presenting advertisements to the user may allow or motivate the developer to continue to develop, maintain and upgrade the software product.  Conversely, the advertisements may be seen by the user as interruptions or annoyances, or as distractions from the task at hand.

Some adware is also [[shareware]], and so the word may be used as term of distinction to differentiate between types of shareware software. What differentiates adware from other shareware is that it is primarily advertising-supported. Users may also be given the option to pay for a &quot;registered&quot; or &quot;licensed&quot; copy to do away with the advertisements. The [[Eudora (e-mail client)|Eudora]] e-mail client is an example of an adware &quot;mode&quot; in a program. After a trial period during which all program features are available, the user is offered a choice: free of charge with limited functionality, a mode with full functionality which displays advertisements for Eudora, or a paid mode that enables all features and turns off the ads.

=== Malware ===
Some adware can also be classified as [[spyware]], a type of [[malware]] (malicious software) which steals information. For example [[BonziBUDDY]], an application marketed as an &quot;Intelligent [[software agent]]&quot;, corrupted many of the user's system files, forcing the display of many obscene advertisements (composed mostly of infected [[Flash Video|Flash]] coding); these and the main application logged browsing details and sent them to various third parties.

== Prevention and detection ==
Programs have been developed to detect, quarantine, and remove spyware, including [[Ad-Aware]], [[Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware]], [[Spyware Doctor]] and [[Spybot - Search &amp; Destroy]]. In addition, almost all commercial [[antivirus software]] currently detect adware and spyware, or offer a separate spyware detection package.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

For example, the latest versions of [[McAfee VirusScan]], [[Norton AntiVirus]] 2004, and [[Trend Micro Internet Security|Trend Micro PC-Cillin]] 2004 now scan for some adware and spyware.
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reluctance to add adware and spyware detection to commercial antivirus products was fueled by a fear of [[lawsuits]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} [[Kaspersky]], for example, was sued by [[Zango (company)|Zango]] for blocking the installation of their products. Zango software and components are almost universally detected as adware nowadays.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

[[Image:Aeacus telemon.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Aeacus and [[Telamon]] by [[Jean-Michel Moreau le Jeune]].]]

'''Aeacus''' (also spelled '''Eäcus''', [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ''{{polytonic|Αἰακός}}'', &quot;bewailing&quot; or &quot;earth borne&quot;{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}) was a [[Greek mythology|mythological]] king of the island of [[Aegina]] in the [[Saronic Gulf]].

He was son of [[Zeus]] and [[Aegina (mythology)|Aegina]], a daughter of the river-god [[Asopus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Nonn. Dionys. vi. 212&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' vi. 113, vii. 472, &amp;c.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to some accounts Aeacus was a son of Zeus and [[Europa (mythology)|Europa]].  Some traditions related that at the time when Aeacus was born, [[Aegina]] was not yet inhabited, and that Zeus changed the ants ({{polytonic|μύρμηκες}}) of the island into men ([[Myrmidons]]) over whom Aeacus ruled, or that he made men grow up out of the earth.&lt;ref name=&quot;Apollodorus, iii. 12. § 6&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Hesiod]], ''Fragm.'' 67, ed. Gottling&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ''l.c.''&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Ovid]], on the other hand, supposes that the island was not uninhabited at the time of the birth of Aeacus, and states that, in the reign of Aeacus, [[Hera]], jealous of Aegina, ravaged the island bearing the name of the latter by sending a plague or a fearful [[dragon]] into it, by which nearly all its inhabitants were carried off, and that Zeus restored the population by changing the ants into men.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' vii. 520&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;comp. Hygin. ''Fab.'' 52&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Strabo]], viii. p. 375&lt;/ref&gt;

These legends seem to be a mythical account of the colonization of Aegina, which seems to have been originally inhabited by [[Pelasgians]], and afterwards received colonists from [[Phthiotis]], the seat of the Myrmidons, and from [[Phlius]] on the [[Asopus]].  Aeacus while he reigned in Aegina was renowned in all Greece for his justice and piety, and was frequently called upon to settle disputes not only among men, but even among the gods themselves.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pindar]], ''Isthmian Odes'' viii. 48, &amp;c.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], i. 39. § 5&lt;/ref&gt;  He was such a favourite with the latter, that, when Greece was visited by a [[drought]] in consequence of a murder which had been committed, the oracle of Delphi declared that the calamity would not cease unless Aeacus prayed to the gods that it might.&lt;ref name=&quot;Apollodorus, iii. 12. § 6&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Diodorus Siculus]], iv. 60, 61&lt;/ref&gt;  Aeacus prayed, and it ceased in consequence. Aeacus himself showed his gratitude by erecting a temple to Zeus Panhellenius on mount Panhellenion,&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ii. 30. § 4&lt;/ref&gt; and the Aeginetans afterwards built a sanctuary in their island called Aeaceum, which was a square place enclosed by walls of white marble.  Aeacus was believed in later times to be buried under the altar in this sacred enclosure.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pausanias, ii. 29. § 6&quot;&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ii. 29. § 6&lt;/ref&gt;

A legend preserved in [[Pindar]] relates that [[Apollo]] and [[Poseidon]] took Aeacus as their assistant in building the walls of Troy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pindar]], ''Olympian Odes'' viii. 39, &amp;c.&lt;/ref&gt;  When the work was completed, three [[dragon]]s rushed against the wall, and while the two of them which attacked those parts of the wall built by the gods fell down dead, the third forced its way into the city through the part built by Aeacus.  Hereupon Apollo prophesied that [[Troy]] would fall through the hands of Aeacus's descandants, the [[Aeacidae]].

Aeacus was also believed by the Aeginetans to have surrounded their island with high cliffs to protect it against [[piracy|pirates]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ii. 29. § 5&lt;/ref&gt;  Several other incidents connected with the story of Aeacus are mentioned by [[Ovid]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' vii. 506, &amp;c., ix. 435, &amp;c&lt;/ref&gt;  By [[Endeïs]] Aeacus had two sons, [[Telamon]] and [[Peleus]] (father of Achilles), and by [[Psamathe]] a son, [[Phocus]], whom he preferred to the two others, both of whom contrived to kill Phocus during a contest, and then fled from their native island.

After his death, Aeacus became (along with the [[Minoan Crete|Cretan]] brothers [[Rhadamanthys]] and [[Minos]]) one of the three judges in [[Hades]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' xiii. 25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Horace]], ''Carmen'' ii. 13. 22&lt;/ref&gt; and according to [[Plato]] especially for the shades of Europeans.&lt;ref&gt;[[Plato]], ''[[Gorgias (dialogue)|Gorgias]]'' p. 523&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Isocrates]], ''Evag.'' 5&lt;/ref&gt;  In works of art he was represented bearing a sceptre and the keys of Hades.&lt;ref name=&quot;Apollodorus, iii. 12. § 6&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Pindar]], ''Isthmian Odes'' viii. 47, &amp;c.&lt;/ref&gt;  Aeacus had sanctuaries both at [[Athens]] and in [[Aegina]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Pausanias, ii. 29. § 6&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Hesychius]] ''s.v.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schol. ''ad Pind. Nem.'' xiii. 155&lt;/ref&gt; and the Aeginetans regarded him as the tutelary deity of their island.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pindar]], ''Nemean Odes'' viii. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Frogs]]'' (405 BC) by [[Aristophanes]], [[Dionysus]] descends to [[Hades]] and announces himself as [[Heracles]]. Aeacus laments [[Heracles]]'s theft of [[Cerberus]] and sentences [[Dionysus]] to [[Acheron]] and torment by hounds of [[Cocytus]], [[Echidna (mythology)|Echidna]], the Tartesian eel, and Tithrasian Gorgons.

[[Alexander the Great]] traced his ancestry (through his mother) to Aeacus.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Aeclanum''' (also spelled '''Aeculanum''') was an ancient town of [[Samnium]], southern [[Italy]], c. 25&amp;nbsp;km east-southeast of [[Beneventum]], on the [[Via Appia]] (near the modern [[Mirabella Eclano]]).

It became the chief town of the [[Hirpini]] after [[Benevento|Beneventum]] had become a [[Rome|Roman]] [[colony]].

[[Lucius Cornelius Sulla|Sulla]] captured it in 89 BC by setting on fire the wooden breastwork by which it was defended, and new fortifications were erected.

[[Hadrian]], who repaired the Via Appia from Beneventum to this point, made it a colony; it has ruins of the city walls, of an [[aqueduct (Roman)|aqueduct]], baths and an [[amphitheatre]]; nearly 400 inscriptions have also been discovered.

Two different routes to [[Apulia]] diverged at this point, one (Via Aurelia Aeclanensis) leading through the modern [[Ariano]] to [[Herdoniae]], the other (the Via Appia of the Empire) passing the [[Ampsanctus|Lacus Ampsanctus]] and going on to [[Aquilonia]] and [[Venusia]]; while the road from Aeclanum to [[Abellinum]] (mod.  [[Avellino]]) may also follow an ancient line.

[[Julian of Eclanum]] was [[bishop]] of the town during the 5th century. With the [[Lombards|Lombard]] invasion of Italy it was annexed to the [[Duchy of Benevento]], until it was finally destroyed by the Byzantines of [[Constans II]] in 663, reducing to a small hamlet known as '''Quintodecimo''' (referring to its distance of 15 miles from Benevento).

'''Aedesius ''' ([[ancient Greek|Greek]] '''{{polytonic|Αιδέσιος}}''', died 355) was a [[Neo-Platonism|Neoplatonist]] philosopher and mystic born of a noble [[Cappadocia]]n family.  

==Career==
He migrated to [[Syria]], attracted by the lectures of [[Iamblichus (philosopher)|Iamblichus]], of whom he became a follower. According to [[Eunapius]], he differed from Iamblichus on certain points connected with [[theurgy]] and [[magic (paranormal)|magic]].  After the death of his master the school of Syria was dispersed, and Aedesius seems to have modified his doctrines out of fear of [[Constantine II of the Roman Empire|Constantine]], and took refuge in [[divination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

An oracle in [[hexameter]] verse represented a pastoral life as his only retreat, but his disciples, perhaps calming his fears by a metaphorical interpretation, compelled him to resume his instructions.  

He settled at [[Pergamum]], where he numbered among his pupils [[Eusebius of Myndus]], [[Maximus of Ephesus]], and the emperor [[Julian the Apostate|Julian]]. After the accession of the latter to the imperial purple he invited Aedesius to continue his instructions, but the declining strength of the sage being unequal to the task, two of his most learned disciples, [[Chrysanthius]] and the aforementioned Eusebius, were by his own desire appointed to supply his place.&lt;ref&gt;Eunapius, ''Vita Aedesius''&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Ephesus library-650px.jpg|thumb|275px|Front of [[Celsus]] Library with aediculae]]
[[File:Cathedral of exeter.jpg|thumb|275px|Gothic facade of [[Exeter Cathedral]], with rows of figures in aedicular or tabernacle frames above the door, and two above the [[crenellation]]s]] 

In [[religion in ancient Rome]], an '''''aedicula''''' (plural '''''aediculae''''') is a small [[shrine]]. The word ''aedicula'' is the [[diminutive]] of the [[Latin]] ''[[aedes (Roman)|aedes]]'', a temple building or house.

Many aediculae were household [[shrine]]s that held small [[altar]]s or [[statue]]s of the [[Lares]] and [[Penates]]. The Lares were [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman deities]] protecting the house and the family household gods. The Penates were originally [[patron gods]] (really [[genius (mythology)|genii]]) of the storeroom, later becoming household gods guarding the entire house.

Other aediculae were small shrines within larger [[temple]]s, usually set on a base, surmounted by a pediment and surrounded by columns. In Roman architecture the aedicula has this representative function in the society. They are installed in public buildings like the [[Triumphal arch]], [[City gate]], or [[Therm]]es. The [[Celsus]] Library in [[Ephesus]] (2. c. AD) is a good example.  From the 4th century Christianization of the Roman Empire onwards such shrines, or the framework enclosing them, are often called by the Biblical term [[tabernacle]], which becomes extended to any elaborated framework for a niche, window or picture.   

==Gothic aediculae==
As in [[Classical architecture]], in [[Gothic architecture]], too, an aedicule or  tabernacle frame is a structural framing device that gives importance to its contents, whether an inscribed plaque, a [[cult object]], a bust or the like, by assuming the tectonic vocabulary of a little building that sets it apart from the wall against which it is placed. A tabernacle frame on a wall serves similar hieratic functions as a free-standing, three-dimensional architectural [[baldaquin]] or a [[Ciborium (architecture)|ciborium]] over an [[altar]].

In Late Gothic settings, [[altarpiece]]s and [[devotional image]]s were customarily crowned with [[gable]]s and canopies supported by clustered-column piers, echoing in small the architecture of Gothic churches.  Painted ædicules frame figures from sacred history in initial letters of [[Illuminated manuscript]]s.

==Renaissance aediculae==
[[File:Palazzo medici riccardi finestre inginocchiate.JPG|thumb|Two &quot;tabernacle windows&quot; in the [[Palazzo Medici Riccardi]] in Florence.  These are of the type known as &quot;inginocchiata&quot;, &quot;kneeling&quot; on two brackets.]] 
Classicizing architectonic structure and decor ''all'antica'', in the &quot;ancient [Roman] mode&quot;, became a fashionable way to frame a painted or bas-relief portrait, or protect an expensive and precious mirror &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/fram/ho_1975.1.1638.htm Metropolitan Museum: tabernacle frame, Florence, ca 1510]&lt;/ref&gt; during the [[High Renaissance]]; Italian precedents were imitated in France, then in Spain, England and Germany during the later 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nga.gov/exhibitions/tabernacleinfo.shtm National Gallery of Art: Tabernacle frames from the Samuel H. Kress collection]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-Renaissance classicism==
Aedicular door surrounds that are architecturally treated, with pilasters or columns flanking the doorway and an [[entablature]] even with a [[pediment]] over it came into use with the 16th century.  In the [[neo-Palladian]] revival in Britain, architectonic aedicular or tabernacle frames, carved and gilded. are favourite schemes for English [[Palladian]] mirror frames of the late 1720s through the 1740s, by such designers as [[William Kent]].

==Other aedicula==
Similar small shrines, called ''[[naiskos|naiskoi]]'', are found in [[Religion in ancient Greece|Greek religion]], but their use was strictly religious.

Aediculae exist today in Roman [[cemeteries]] as a part of funeral architecture.

Presently the most famous Aedicule is situated inside the [[Holy Sepulchre]] in Jerusalem.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Gaul, 1st century BC.gif|thumb|300px|A map of [[Gaul]] in the 1st century BC, showing the location of the Aedui tribe.]]

'''Aedui''', Haedui  or Hedui ({{lang-grc|Αἰδούοι}}), were a [[Gauls|Gallic]] people of [[Gallia Lugdunensis]], who inhabited the country between the Arar ([[Saône]]) and Liger ([[Loire]]), in today's France. Their territory thus included the greater part of the modern departments of [[Saône-et-Loire]], [[Côte-d'Or]] and [[Nièvre]].

==Geography==
The country of the Aedui is defined by reports of them in the ancient writers. The upper [[Loire]] formed their western border,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Caesar|BG|loc=Book vii, Section 5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; separating them from the [[Bituriges]]. The [[Saône]] formed their eastern border, separating them from the [[Sequani]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Caesar|BG|loc=Book I, Section 12}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Sequani did not reside in the region of the confluence of the [[Doubs]] into the Saône and of the latter into the [[Rhône]], as Caesar says that the [[Helvetii]], following the pass between the [[Jura Mountains]] and the Rhône southwards, which belonged to the Sequani, plundered the territory of the Aedui.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Caesar|BG|loc=Book I, Section 11}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These circumstances explain an apparent contradiction in [[Strabo]], who in one sentence says that the Aedui lived between the Saône and the Doubs, and in the next, that the Sequani lived across the Saône (eastward).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Strabo|Geography|loc=Book 4, Chapter 3, Section 2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Both statements are true, the first in the south, and the second to the north.

==History==
[[File:Eduens denier 1st century BCE 1940mg.jpg|thumb|Eduens [[denier]], 1st century BCE, 1940mg. [[Hotel de la Monnaie]].]]
According to [[Livy]] (v. 34), they took part in the expedition of [[Bellovesus]] into Italy in the 6th century BC.

Before [[Julius Caesar|Caesar's]] time they had attached themselves to the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], and were honoured with the title of brothers and kinsmen of the Roman people{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}.  When the [[Sequani]], their neighbours on the other side of the [[Saône|Arar]], with whom they were continually warring with, invaded their country and subjugated them with the assistance of a [[Germanic tribes|Germanic]] chieftain named [[Ariovistus]], the Aedui sent [[Diviciacus (Aedui)|Diviciacus]], the [[Druidry|druid]], to Rome to appeal to the [[Roman Senate|senate]] for help, but his mission was unsuccessful{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}.

On his arrival in [[Gaul]] (58 BC), Caesar restored their independence.  In spite of this, the Aedui joined the Gallic coalition against Caesar (''B. G.'' vii. 42), but after the surrender of [[Vercingetorix]] at [[Battle of Alesia|Alesia]] were glad to return to their allegiance.  [[Caesar Augustus|Augustus]] dismantled{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} their native capital [[Bibracte]] on [[Mont Beuvray]], and substituted a new town with a half-Roman, half-Gaulish name, Augustodunum (modern [[Autun]]).

In 21, during the reign of [[Tiberius]], they revolted under [[Julius Sacrovir]], and seized [[Augustodunum]], but were soon put down by Gaius Silius ([[Gaius Cornelius Tacitus|Tacitus]] ''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Ann.]]'' iii. 43-46).  The Aedui were the first of the Gauls to receive from the emperor [[Claudius]] the distinction of ''[[jus honorum]]''.  The oration of [[Eumenius]], in which he pleaded for the restoration of the schools of his native place Augustodunum, shows that the district was neglected.  The chief magistrate of the Aedui in Caesar's time was called [[Vergobretus]] (according to [[Theodor Mommsen|Mommsen]], &quot;judgment-worker&quot;), who was elected annually, possessed powers of life and death, but was forbidden to go beyond the frontier. Certain clientes, or small communities, were also dependent upon the Aedui. 

It is possible that the Aedui adopted many of the governmental practices of the Romans, such as the electing of magistrates and other officials. Or perhaps this was a natural development in their political system. It is thought other Celtic tribes, such as the Remi and the Baiocasses, also elected their leaders{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}.

The '''Aegadian Islands ''' ([[Sicilian language|Sicilian]]: '''''Ìsuli Ègadi''''', {{lang-it|'''Isole Egadi'''}}; {{lang-la|'''Aegates Insulae'''}}), are a group of small mountainous islands in the [[Mediterranean Sea]] off the northwest coast of [[Sicily]], [[Italy]], near the city of [[Trapani]], with a total area of {{convert|14.46|sqmi|km2|2}}.

[[Favignana]] (''Aegusa''), the largest, lies {{convert|10|mi|km}} south west of [[Trapani]]; [[Levanzo]] (''Phorbantia'') {{convert|8|mi|km}} west; while [[Marettimo]], the ancient ''Iera Nesos'', {{convert|15|mi|km}} west of Trapani, is now reckoned as a part of the group. There are also two minor islands, Formica and Maraone, lying between Levanzo and Sicily. For administrative purposes the [[archipelago]] constitutes the comune of Favignana in the [[Province of Trapani]].

The overall population in 1987 was estimated at about 5,000. Though winter frost is unknown, rainfall is low. The main occupation of the islanders is fishing and this is where the largest [[tuna]] fishery in Sicily can be found.

[[Image:Erice-views-bjs-2.jpg|thumb|left|A view from Erice to Favignana and Levanzo. On the horizon Marettimo is faintly visible.]]

==History==
There is evidence of [[Neolithic]] and even [[Paleolithic]] paintings in caves on Levanzo, and to a lesser extent on Favignana.

The islands were the scene of the [[Battle of the Aegates Islands]] of 241 BC, in which the [[Carthage|Carthaginian]] fleet was defeated by [[Gaius Lutatius Catulus|C. Lutatius Catulus]]; the engagement ended the [[First Punic War]]. With the end of western Roman power, the islands, to the extent that they were governed at all, were part of territories of Goths, Vandals, Saracens, before the [[Normans]] fortified Favignana in 1081.

The islands belonged to the Pallavicini-Rusconi family of [[Genoa]] until 1874, when they were bought by the [[Florio]] family of [[Palermo]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{History of Greece}}
'''Aegean civilization''' is a general term for the [[Bronze Age]] [[civilization]]s of [[Greece]] around the [[Aegean Sea]]. There are in fact three distinct but communicating and interacting geographic regions covered by this term: [[Crete]], the [[Cyclades]] and the Greek mainland. Crete is associated with the [[Minoan civilization]] from the Early Bronze Age. The Cyclades converge with the mainland during the [[Early Helladic]] (&quot;[[Minyans|Minyan]]&quot;) period and with Crete in the Middle Minoan period. From ca. 1450 (Late Helladic, Late Minoan), the Greek [[Mycenaean civilization]] spreads to Crete.

==Periodization==

*Early Cycladic 3300-2000 BCE
*Kastri = EH II-EH III (ca. 2500-2100) BCE

==Commerce==
Commerce was practiced to some extent in very early times, as is proved by the distribution of [[Melos|Melian]] [[obsidian]] over all the Aegean area. We find Cretan vessels exported to [[Melos]], [[Egypt]] and the [[Greece|Greek]] mainland. Melian vases came in their turn to Crete. After 1600 B.C. there is very close commerce with Egypt, and Aegean things find their way to all coasts of the Mediterranean. No traces of [[currency]] have come to light, unless certain axeheads, too slight for practical use, had that character. Standard weights have been found, as well as representations of ingots. The Aegean written documents have not yet proved (by being found outside the area) to be [[epistolary]] (letter writing) correspondence with other countries. Representations of ships are not common, but several have been observed on Aegean gems, gem-sealings, [[frying pans]] and vases. They are vessels of low free-board, with [[mast (sailing)|masts]] and [[oar]]s. Familiarity with the sea is proved by the free use of marine motifs in decoration. The most detailed illustrations are to be found on the 'ship fresco' at [[Akrotiri (Santorini)|Akrotiri]] on the island of Thera (Santorini) preserved by the ash fall from the volcanic eruption which destroyed the town there.

Discoveries, later in the 20th century, of sunken trading vessels such as those at [[Uluburun]] and [[Cape Gelidonya]] off the south coast of Turkey have brought forth an enormous amount of new information about that culture.

==Evidence==
For details of monumental evidence the articles on [[Crete]], [[Mycenae]], [[Tiryns]], [[Troad]], [[Cyprus]], etc., must be consulted. The most representative site explored up to now is [[Knossos]] (see [[Crete]]) which has yielded not only the most various but the most continuous evidence from the [[Neolithic age]] to the twilight of classical civilization. Next in importance come [[Hissarlik]], Mycenae, [[Phaestus]], [[Hagia Triada]], Tiryns, Phylakope, [[Palaikastro]] and [[Gournia]].

===Internal evidence===
*'''Structures'''; [[Ruin]]s of [[palace]]s, palatial [[villa]]s, houses, built dome- or cist-[[Tholos tomb|graves]] and [[fortification]]s (Aegean islands, [[Greece|Greek]] mainland and northwestern [[Anatolia]]), but not distinct [[temple (Greek)|temples]]; small [[shrine]]s, however, and temene (religious enclosures, remains of one of which were probably found at Petsofa near Palaikastro by J. L. Myres in 1904) are represented on [[intaglio (sculpture)|intaglio]]s and [[fresco]]es. From the sources and from inlay-work we have also representations of palaces and houses.
*'''Structural Decoration'''; Architectural features, such as [[column]]s, [[frieze]]s and various [[molding (decorative)|mouldings]]; [[mural]] decoration, such as fresco-paintings, coloured [[relief]]s and [[mosaic]] inlay. Roof tiles were also occasionally employed, as at early Helladic [[Lerna]] and Akovitika,&lt;ref name=&quot;Joseph W. Shaw 72&quot;&gt;Joseph W. Shaw, The Early Helladic II Corridor House: Development and Form, ''American Journal of Archaeology'', Vol. 91, No. 1. (Jan., 1987), pp. 59-79 (72).&lt;/ref&gt; and later in the [[Mycenae]]an towns of [[Gla]] and [[Midea (Argolid)|Midea]].&lt;ref&gt;Ione Mylonas Shear, “Excavations on the Acropolis of Midea: Results of the Greek-Swedish Excavations under the Direction of Katie Demakopoulou and Paul åström”, ''American Journal of Archaeology'', Vol. 104, No. 1. (Jan., 2000), pp. 133-134.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Furniture]]'''; (a) Domestic furniture, such as [[Packaging|vessel]]s of all sorts and in many materials, from huge store jars down to tiny [[unguent]] pots; culinary and other implements; [[throne]]s, [[chair|seats]], [[Furniture#Table|tables]], etc., these all in stone or plastered [[terracotta]]. (b) Sacred furniture, such as models or actual examples of [[ritual]] objects; of these we have also numerous pictorial representations. (c) [[Funeral|Funerary]] furniture, for example, [[coffin]]s in painted terracotta.
*'''Art products'''; for example, plastic objects, carved in [[Rock (geology)|stone]] or [[ivory]], cast or beaten in metals ([[gold]], [[silver]], [[copper]] and [[bronze]]), or modelled in [[clay]], [[faience]], [[Wheatpaste|paste]], etc. Very little trace has yet been found of large free-standing [[sculpture]], but many examples exist of sculptors' smaller work. [[Vase]]s of all kinds, carved in [[marble]] or other stones, cast or beaten in metals or fashioned in clay, the latter in enormous number and variety, richly ornamented with coloured schemes, and sometimes bearing moulded decoration. Examples of painting on stone, opaque and transparent. Engraved objects in great number for example, ring-bezels and [[engraved gem|gem]]s; and an immense quantity of clay impressions, taken from these.
*'''[[Weapon]]s, [[tool]]s and implements'''; In [[stone]], [[clay]] and [[bronze]], and at the last [[iron]], sometimes richly ornamented or inlaid. Numerous representations also of the same. No actual body-[[armour]], except such as was ceremonial and buried with the dead, like the gold breastplates in the circle-graves at Mycenae or the full length body [[Dendra armour|armour]] from [[Dendra]].
*'''Articles of personal use'''; for example, [[brooch]]es (fibulae), [[pin]]s, [[razor]]s, [[tweezers]], etc., often found as dedications to a deity, for example, in the [[Crete|Dictaean Cavern of Crete]]. No [[textile]]s have survived other than impressions in clay.
*'''Written documents'''; for example, clay tablets and discs (so far in Crete only), but nothing of more perishable nature, such as skin, [[papyrus]], etc.; engraved gems and gem impressions; [[legend]]s written with [[pigment]] on [[pottery]] (rare); characters incised on stone or pottery. These show a number of systems of script employing either [[ideogram]]s or syllabograms (see [[Linear B]]).
*'''Excavated [[tomb]]s'''; Of either the pit, [[Mycenaean chamber tomb|chamber]] or the [[Beehive tomb|tholos]] kind, in which the dead were laid, together with various objects of use and luxury, without cremation, and in either coffins or loculi or simple wrappings.
*'''Public works'''; Such as paved and stepped roadways, bridges, systems of drainage, etc.

===External evidence===
*'''Monuments and records of other contemporary civilizations'''; for example, representations of alien peoples in Egyptian frescoes; imitation of Aegean fabrics and style in non-Aegean lands; allusions to [[Mediterranean]] peoples in [[Egypt]]ian, [[Semitic]] or [[Babylon]]ian records.
*'''Literary traditions of subsequent civilizations'''; Especially the Hellenic; such as, for example,, those embodied in the [[Homer]]ic poems, the legends concerning Crete, Mycenae, etc.; statements as to the origin of [[deity|gods]], [[cult]]s and so forth, transmitted to us by Hellenic antiquarians such as [[Strabo]], [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], [[Diodorus Siculus]], etc.
*'''Traces of [[Convention (philosophy and social sciences)|customs]], [[creed]]s, [[ritual]]s, etc.'''; In the Aegean area at a later time, discordant with the civilization in which they were practised and indicating survival from earlier systems. There are also possible [[linguistics|linguistic]] and even physical survivals to be considered.
[[Mycenae]] and [[Tiryns]] are the two principal sites on which evidence of a [[prehistory|prehistoric]] [[civilization]] was remarked long ago by the [[Classical antiquity|classical Greeks]].

==Discovery==
The curtain-wall and towers of the Mycenaean [[citadel]], its [[Lion Gate|gate with heraldic lions]], and the great &quot;[[Treasury of Atreus]]&quot; had borne silent witness for ages before [[Heinrich Schliemann]]'s time; but they were supposed only to speak to the [[Homer]]ic, or, at farthest, a rude Heroic beginning of purely [[History of Greece|Hellenic]] civilization. It was not until Schliemann exposed the contents of the graves which lay just inside the gate, that scholars recognized the advanced stage of [[art]] which prehistoric dwellers in the Mycenaean citadel had attained.

There had been, however, a good deal of other evidence available before 1876, which, had it been collated and seriously studied, might have discounted the sensation that the discovery of the citadel graves eventually made. Although it was recognized that certain tributaries, represented for example, in the XVIIIth Dynasty tomb of Rekhmara at [[Egypt]]ian [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] as bearing vases of peculiar forms, were of some [[Mediterranean]] race, neither their precise habitat nor the degree of their civilization could be determined while so few actual prehistoric remains were known in the [[Mediterranean]] lands. Nor did the Aegean objects which were lying obscurely in museums in 1870, or thereabouts, provide a sufficient test of the real basis underlying the Hellenic myths of the [[Argos|Argolid]], the [[Troad]] and [[Crete]], to cause these to be taken seriously. Aegean vases have been exhibited both at [[Sèvres]] and [[Neuchâtel|Neuchatel]] since about 1840, the provenience (i.e. source or origin) being in the one case Phylakope in [[Milos|Melos]], in the other [[Kefallinia|Cephalonia]].

Ludwig Ross, the [[Germany|German]] [[Archaeology|archaeologist]] appointed Curator of the Antiquities of [[History of Athens|Athens]] at the time of the establishment of the Kingdom of [[Greece]], by his explorations in the Greek islands from 1835 onwards, called attention to certain early [[intaglio (sculpture)|intaglio]]s, since known as Inselsteine; but it was not until 1878 that C. T. Newton demonstrated these to be no strayed [[Phoenicia]]n products. In 1866 primitive structures were discovered on the island of Therasia by quarrymen extracting pozzolana, a [[Silicon dioxide|siliceous]] [[volcanic ash]], for the [[Suez Canal]] works. When this discovery was followed up in 1870, on the neighbouring [[Santorini|Santorin (Thera)]], by representatives of the French School at [[Athens]], much pottery of a class now known immediately to precede the typical late Aegean ware, and many stone and metal objects, were found. These were dated by the [[geologist]] Ferdinand A. Fouqué, somewhat arbitrarily, to 2000 B.C., by consideration of the superincumbent eruptive stratum.

Meanwhile, in 1868, tombs at [[Ialysus]] in [[Rhodes]] had yielded to [[Alfred Biliotti]] many fine painted vases of styles which were called later the third and fourth &quot;Mycenaean&quot;; but these, bought by [[John Ruskin]], and presented to the [[British Museum]], excited less attention than they deserved, being supposed to be of some local Asiatic fabric of uncertain date. Nor was a connection immediately detected between them and the objects found four years later in a tomb at Menidi in [[Attica]] and a rock-cut &quot;bee-hive&quot; grave near the Argive Heraeum.

Even Schliemann's first [[excavation (archaeology)|excavation]]s at Hissarlik in the [[Troad]] did not excite surprise. But the &quot;Burnt City&quot; of his second stratum, revealed in 1873, with its fortifications and vases, and a hoard of [[gold]], [[silver]] and [[bronze]] objects, which the discoverer connected with it, began to arouse a curiosity which was destined presently to spread far outside the narrow circle of scholars. As soon as Schliemann came on the Mycenae graves three years later, light poured from all sides on the prehistoric period of [[Greece]]. It was recognized that the character of both the fabric and the decoration of the Mycenaean objects was not that of any well-known art. A wide range in space was proved by the identification of the Inselsteine and the Ialysus vases with the new style, and a wide range in time by collation of the earlier Theraean and Hissarlik discoveries. A relationship between objects of art described by [[Homer]] and the Mycenaean treasure was generally allowed, and a correct opinion prevailed that, while certainly posterior, the civilization of the [[Iliad]] was reminiscent of the Mycenaean.

Schliemann got to work again at Hissarlik in 1878, and greatly increased our knowledge of the lower strata, but did not recognize the Aegean remains in his &quot;Lydian&quot; city of the sixth stratum. These were not to be fully revealed until Dr. Wilhelm Dorpfeld, who had become Schliemann's assistant in 1879, resumed the work at Hissarlik in 1892 after the first explorer's death. But by laying bare in 1884 the upper stratum of remains on the rock of [[Tiryns]], Schliemann made a contribution to our knowledge of prehistoric domestic life which was amplified two years later by Christos Tsountas's discovery of the palace at Mycenae. Schliemann's work at Tiryns was not resumed till 1905, when it was proved, as had long been suspected, that an earlier palace underlies the one he had exposed.

From 1886 dates the finding of Mycenaean [[sepulchre]]s outside the Argolid, from which, and from the continuation of Tsountas's exploration of the buildings and lesser graves at Mycenae, a large treasure, independent of Schliemann's princely gift, has been gathered into the [[National Archaeological Museum of Athens|National Museum]] at Athens. In that year tholos-tombs, most already pillaged but retaining some of their furniture, were excavated at Arkina and [[Eleusis]] in Attica, at [[Dimini]] near [[Volos]] in [[Thessaly]], at Kampos on the west of Mount [[Taygetus]], and at Maskarata in [[Kefallinia|Cephalonia]]. The richest grave of all was explored at [[Vaphio]] in [[Laconia]] in 1889, and yielded, besides many gems and miscellaneous goldsmiths' work, two golden goblets chased with scenes of bull-hunting, and certain broken vases painted in a large bold style which remained an enigma until the excavation of [[Knossos]].

In 1890 and 1893, Staes cleared out certain less rich tholos-tombs at Thoricus in [[Attica]]; and other graves, either rock-cut &quot;bee-hives&quot; or chambers, were found at Spata and Aphidna in Attica, in [[Aegina]] and [[Salamis Island|Salamis]], at the [[Heraion of Argos|Argive Heraeum]] and [[Nafplion|Nauplia]] in the Argolid, near [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]] and [[Delphi]], and not far from the [[Thessaly|Thessalian]] [[Larissa]]. During the [[Acropolis]] excavations in Athens, which terminated in 1888, many potsherds of the Mycenaean style were found; but Olympia had yielded either none, or such as had not been recognized before being thrown away, and the temple site at [[Delphi]] produced nothing distinctively Aegean (in dating). The [[United States|American]] explorations of the Argive Heraeum, concluded in 1895, also failed to prove that site to have been important in the prehistoric time, though, as was to be expected from its neighbourhood to Mycenae itself, there were traces of occupation in the later Aegean periods.

Prehistoric research had now begun to extend beyond the Greek mainland. Certain central Aegean islands, [[Antiparos]], [[Ios Island|Ios]], [[Amorgos]], [[Syros]] and [[Siphnos]], were all found to be singularly rich in evidence of the Middle-Aegean period. The series of Syran-built graves, containing crouching corpses, is the best and most representative that is known in the Aegean. Melos, long marked as a source of early objects but not systematically excavated until taken in hand by the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[British School at Athens|School]] at [[Athens]] in 1896, yielded at Phylakope remains of all the Aegean periods, except the [[Neolithic]].

A map of [[Cyprus]] in the later [[Bronze Age]] (such as is given by J. L. Myres and M. O. Richter in Catalogue of the [[Cyprus]] Museum) shows more than 25 settlements in and about the Mesaorea district alone, of which one, that at [[Enkomi]], near the site of [[Salamis, Cyprus|Salamis]], has yielded the richest Aegean treasure in precious metal found outside Mycenae. E. Chantre in 1894 picked up lustreless ware, like that of Hissariik, in central Phtygia and at Pteria, and the [[England|English]] archaeological expeditions, sent subsequently into north-western [[Anatolia]], have never failed to bring back ceramic specimens of Aegean appearance from the valleys of the Rhyndncus, Sangarius and Halys.

In [[Egypt]] in 1887, W. M. F. Petrie found painted sherds of Cretan style at [[El-Lahun|Kahun]] in the [[Al Fayyum|Fayum]], and farther up the [[Nile]], at [[Amarna|Tell el-Amarna]], chanced on bits of no fewer than 800 Aegean vases in 1889. There have now been recognized in the collections at [[Cairo]], [[Florence]], [[London]], [[Paris]] and [[Bologna]] several Egyptian imitations of the Aegean style which can be set off against the many debts which the centres of Aegean culture owed to Egypt. Two Aegean vases were found at [[Sidon]] in 1885, and many fragments of Aegean and especially Cypriot pottery have been found during recent excavations of sites in [[Philistines|Philistia]] by the Palestine Fund.

[[Sicily]], ever since P. Orsi excavated the Sicel cemetery near Lentini in 1877, has proved a mine of early remains, among which appear in regular succession Aegean fabrics and motives of decoration from the period of the second stratum at Hissarlik. Sardinia has Aegean sites, for example, at Abini near Teti; and [[Spain]] has yielded objects recognized as Aegean from tombs near [[Cádiz|Cadiz]] and from [[Zaragoza, Spain|Saragossa]].

One land, however, has eclipsed all others in the Aegean by the wealth of its remains of all the prehistoric ages&amp;mdash; Crete; and so much so that, for the present, we must regard it as the fountainhead of Aegean civilization, and probably for long its political and social centre. The island first attracted the notice of archaeologists by the remarkable archaic Greek bronzes found in a cave on [[Mount Ida]] in 1885, as well as by [[epigraph (archeology)|epigraph]]ic [[monument]]s such as the famous law of Gortyna (also called [[Gortyn]]). But the first undoubted Aegean remains reported from it were a few objects extracted from Cnossus by Minos Kalokhairinos of Candia in 1878. These were followed by certain discoveries made in the S. plain Messara by F. Halbherr. Unsuccessful attempts at Cnossus were made by both W. J. Stillman and H. Schliemann, and A. J. Evans, coming on the scene in 1893, travelled in succeeding years about the island picking up trifles of unconsidered evidence, which gradually convinced him that greater things would eventually be found. He obtained enough to enable him to forecast the discovery of written characters, till then not suspected in Aegean civilization. The revolution of 1897-98 opened the door to wider knowledge, and much exploration has ensued, for which see [[Crete]].

Thus the &quot;Aegean Area&quot; has now come to mean the [[Archipelago]] with Crete and [[Cyprus]], the Hellenic peninsula with the [[Ionian islands]], and Western [[Anatolia]]. Evidence is still wanting for the [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonian]] and [[Thrace|Thracian]] coasts. Offshoots are found in the western [[Mediterranean]] area, in [[Sicily]], [[Italy]], [[Sardinia]] and [[Spain]], and in the eastern Mediterranean area in [[Syria]] and [[Egypt]]. Regarding the [[Cyrenaica]], we are still insufficiently informed.

Apulian red-figured [[Krater|volute-krater]], ca. 410–400 BC, from Ruvo (South Italy).]]
:''For the [[Sparta]]n hero Aegeus, see [[Aegeus (hero)]].''
In [[Greek mythology]], '''Aegeus''' ({{lang-el|Αἰγεύς}}), also '''Aigeus''', '''Aegeas''' or '''Aigeas''' (Αιγέας), was an archaic figure in the [[founding myth]] of [[Athens]]. The &quot;goat-man&quot; who gave his name to the [[Aegean Sea]] was, next to [[Poseidon]], the father of [[Theseus]], the founder of Athenian institutions and one of the [[kings of Athens]].

==The myth==
===His reign===
Upon the death of the king his father, [[Pandion II]], Aegeus and his three brothers, [[Pallas (son of Pandion)|Pallas]], [[Nisos]], and [[Lycus|Lykos]], took control of Athens from [[Metion]], who had seized the throne from Pandion. They divided the government in four but Aegeas became king.

Aegeus' first wife was [[Meta]]&lt;ref&gt;Compare [[Metis (mythology)|Metis]].&lt;/ref&gt; and the second was [[Chalciope]]. Still without a male heir, Aegeus asked the [[Pythia|Oracle]] at [[Delphi]] for advice. Her cryptic words were &quot;Do not loosen the bulging mouth of the wineskin until you have reached the height of Athens, lest you die of grief.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Vita of Theseus''; Pseudo-Apollodorus, ''[[Bibliotheke]]'' 3,15.6.&lt;/ref&gt; Aegeus did not understand the prophecy and was disappointed.

This puzzling oracle, forced Aegeus to visit [[Pittheus]], king of [[Troezen]], who was famed for his wisdom and skill at expounding oracles. Pittheus understood the prophecy and introduced Aegeus to his daughter, [[Aethra (Greek mythology)|Aethra]], when he was drunk.&lt;ref&gt;[[Scholium|Scholion]] on Euripides' ''Hippolytus'', noted by Karl Kerenyi, ''The Heroes of the Greeks'' (1959) p 218 note 407.&lt;/ref&gt; They slept with each other and then, in some versions, Aethra waded out to the sea to the island of [[Sphairia]] (aka Calauria), and bedded also with [[Poseidon]]. When she fell pregnant, Aegeus decided to go back to Athens. Before leaving, he covered his sandals, shield and sword under a huge rock and told her that when their son grew up, he should move the rock and bring the weapons back, by which sign his father would acknowledge him. Upon his return to Athens, Aegeus married [[Medea]] who had fled from [[Ancient Corinth|Corinth]] and the wrath of [[Jason]]. Aegeus and Medea had one son together named [[Medus]].

===Conflict with Crete===

While visiting in Athens, King [[Minos]]' son, [[Androgeus]] &quot;breeder of men&quot;, managed to defeat Aegeus in every contest during the [[Panathenaic Games]]. Out of jealousy, Aegeus sent him to conquer the [[Marathonian Bull]], which killed him.&lt;ref&gt;Pseudo-Apollodorus, ''[[Bibliotheke]]'' 3.15.7. The identification of the festival as the [[Panathenaia]] is an interpolated anachronism.&lt;/ref&gt; Minos was angry and declared war on Athens. He offered the Athenians peace, however, under the condition that Athens would send seven young men and seven young women every nine years to [[Crete]] to be fed to the [[Minotaur]], a vicious monster. This continued until Theseus killed the Minotaur with the help of [[Ariadne]], Minos' daughter.

===Theseus and Minotaur===
{{main|Theseus}}
In Troezen, Theseus grew up and became a brave young man. He managed to move the rock and took his father's arms. His mother then told him the identity of his father and that he should take the weapons back to him at Athens and be acknowledged. Theseus decided to go to Athens and had the choice of going by sea, which was the safe way, or by land, following a dangerous path with thieves and bandits all the way. Young, brave and ambitious, Theseus decided to go to Athens by land.

When Theseus arrived, he did not reveal his true identity. He was welcomed by Aegeas, who was suspicious about the stranger who came to Athens. Medea tried to have Theseus killed by encouraging Aegeas to ask him to capture the [[Marathonian Bull]], but Theseus succeeded. She tried to poison him, but at the last second, Aegeas recognized his sword and knocked the poisoned cup out of Theseus' hand. Father and son were thus reunited, and Medea was sent away to [[Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;Pseudo-Apollodorus, Epitome of the ''[[Bibliotheke]]'', 1.5-7; [[First Vatican Mythographer]], 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

Theseus departed for Crete.  Upon his departure, Aegeus told him to put up white sails when returning if he was successful in killing the Minotaur. However, when Theseus returned he forgot these instructions.  When Aegeus saw the black sails coming into Athens he jumped into the sea and drowned, mistaken in his belief that his son had been slain.&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus Siculus 4.61.4; Plutarch, ''Vita of Theseus'' 17 and 22; Pausanias 1.22.5; Catullus 64.215-245; Hyginus, ''Fabula'' 41, 43; Servius on the ''Aeneid'' 3.74.&lt;/ref&gt; Henceforth, this sea was known as the [[Aegean Sea]].

[[Sophocles]]' tragedy ''Aegeus'' has been lost, but Aegeus features in [[Euripides]]' ''[[Medea (play)|Medea]]''.

==Legacy==
At Athens, the traveller [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] was informed in the second-century CE that the cult of [[Aphrodite Urania]] above the [[Kerameikos]] was so ancient that it had been established by Aegeas, whose sisters were barren, and he still childless himself.&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias, 1.14.6.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aegina''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|i|ˈ|ʤ|aɪ|n|ə}}; {{lang-el|Αίγινα}} - ''Aígina'' {{IPA-el|ˈeʝina|}}) is one of the [[Saronic Islands]] of [[Greece]] in the [[Saronic Gulf]], {{convert|17|mi|km|abbr=off|lk=off}} from [[Athens]]. [[Tradition]] derives the name from Aegina, the mother of [[Aeacus]], who was born in and ruled the island. During ancient times, Aegina was a rival to Athens, the great sea power of the era.

The municipality Aegina consists of the island Aegina and a few offshore islets. It is part of the [[Islands (peripheral unit)|Islands peripheral unit]], [[Attica Periphery]]. The municipality is subdivided into the following five communities (population in 2001 in brackets):&lt;ref name=Kallikratis&gt;[http://www.kedke.gr/uploads2010/FEKB129211082010_kallikratis.pdf Kallikratis law] Greece Ministry of Interior {{el icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Aegina (7783) 
*Kypseli (1949)
*Mesagros (1603)
*Perdika (743)
*Vathy (1474)

The capital is the town of Aegina, situated at the northwestern end of the island. Due to its proximity to [[Athens]], it is a popular quick getaway during the summer months, with quite a few Athenians owning second houses on the island.

==Geography==

Aegina is roughly triangular in shape, approximately {{convert|15|km|mi|abbr=on|lk=off}} from east to west and {{convert|10|km|mi|abbr=on|lk=off}} from north to south, with an area of about {{convert|87|km2|sqmi|abbr=on|lk=off}}.

An [[volcano|extinct volcano]] constitutes two thirds of Aegina. The northern and western side consist of stony but fertile [[plains]], which are well cultivated and produce luxuriant crops of [[grain]], with some [[cotton]], [[vine]]s, [[almond]]s, [[olive]]s and [[ficus|fig]]s, but the most characteristic crop of Aegina today (2000s) is [[pistachio]]. Economically, the [[Sea sponge|sponge]] fisheries are of notable importance. The southern volcanic part of the island is rugged and mountainous, and largely barren. Its highest rise is the conical [[Mount Oros]] (531 m) in the south, and the Panhellenian ridge stretches northward with narrow fertile valleys on either side.

The beaches are also a popular tourist attraction. [[Hydrofoil]] ferries from [[Piraeus]] take only forty minutes to reach Aegina; the regular ferry takes about an hour, with ticket prices for adults within the 4-15 [[euro]] range. There are regular bus services from Aegina town to destinations throughout the [[List of islands of Greece|island]] such as [[Agia Marina]]. [[Portes, Aigina|Portes]] is a fishing village on the east coast.

=== Prehistory ===
Prehistoric archaeological findings of settlements with [[obsidian]] tools points to an early habitation of the island. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

=== Earliest history (20th–7th centuries BC) ===
Aegina, according to [[Herodotus]],&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus v. 83, viii.46; [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] 2.29.9&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[colony]] of [[Epidaurus]], to which state it was originally subject. Its placement between [[Attica]] and the [[Peloponnesus]] made it a center of trade even earlier, and its earliest inhabitant came from Asia Minor.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Stillwell, ed. ''Princeton Encyclopedia of Classical Sites'', 1976&lt;/ref&gt; [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] ceramics have been found in contexts of ca. 2000 BC. The discovery in the island of a number of gold ornaments belonging to the latest period of [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] art suggests the inference that the Mycenaean culture held its own in Aegina for some generations after the [[Dorians|Dorian]] conquest of [[Argos]] and [[Lacedaemon]].&lt;ref&gt;A. J. Evans, in ''Journal of Hellenic Studies'', vol. xiii. p. 195  {{When|date=February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is probable that the island was not doricized before the 9th century BC.

One of the earliest historical facts is its membership in the League of [[Calauria]] ([[Calaurian amphictyony|Calaurian Amphictyony]], ca. 8th century BC), which included, besides Aegina, [[Athens]], the [[Minyans|Minyan]] (Boeotian) [[Orchomenus (Boeotia)|Orchomenus]], [[Troezen]], [[Hermione]], [[Nauplia]] and [[Prasiae]], and was probably an organization of city-states that were still Mycenaean, for the purpose of suppressing [[piracy]] in the Aegean that arose as a result of the decay of the naval supremacy of the Mycenaean princes.

Aegina appears to have belonged to the [[Eretrian]] league during the [[Lelantine War]]; hence, perhaps, we may explain the war with [[Samos Island|Samos]], a leading member of the rival Chalcidian league in the reign of King [[Amphicrates]] (Herod. iii. 59), i.e. not later than the earlier half of the 7th century BC.

=== Rise as a sea power (6th–5th centuries BC) ===
[[File:BMC 193.jpg|thumb|left|Greek [[drachma]] of Aegina. Obverse: Land [[tortoise]]. / Reverse: ΑΙΓ(INA) and dolphin]]
It follows, therefore, that the maritime importance of the island dates back to pre-[[Dorians|Dorian]] times. It is usually stated on the authority of [[Ephorus]], that [[Pheidon]] of Argos established a mint in Aegina. For example, [[Kydonia]] on [[Crete]] began minting coins by over-striking Aeginetan specimens. Thus it was the Aeginetans who, within 30 or 40&amp;nbsp;years of the invention of coinage by the [[Lydians]] (c. 700 BC), introduced coinage to the Western world. The fact that the Aeginetan scale of coins, weights and measures (developed in the mid-7th century) was one of the two scales in general use in the Greek world (the other being the Euboic-Attic) is sufficient evidence of the early commercial importance of the island.

During the naval expansion of Aegina during the [[Archaic period in Greece|Archaic Period]], Kydonia was an ideal maritime stop for Aegina's fleet on its way to other [[Mediterranean]] ports controlled by the emerging sea-power Aegina.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.themodernantiquarian.com/site/10881/cydonia.html#fieldnotes C. Michael Hogan, ''Cydonia'', Modern Antiquarian, January 23, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;  During the next century Aegina is one of the three principal states trading at the [[Marketplace|emporium]] of [[Naucratis]], and it is the only state of European Greece that has a share in this factory.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus ii. 178&lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning of the 5th century it seems to have been an entrepôt of the [[Pontic]] grain trade, at a later date an Athenian monopoly.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus vii. 147&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the other commercial states of the 7th and 6th centuries BC, such as [[Ancient Corinth|Corinth]], [[Chalcis]], [[Eretria]] and [[Miletus]], Aegina founded no colonies.  The settlements to which Strabo refers (viii. 376) cannot be regarded as any real exceptions to this statement.

=== Rivalry with Athens (5th century BC) ===
The history of Aegina, as it has come down to us, is almost exclusively a history of its relations with the neighbouring state of Athens, which began to compete with the [[thalassocracy]] of Aegina at the beginning of the sixth century. [[Solon]] passed laws limiting Aeginetan commerce in Attica. The legendary history of these relations, as recorded by Herodotus (v. 79-89; vi. 49-51, 73, 85-94), involves critical problems of some difficulty and interest. He traces back the hostility of the two states to a dispute about the images of the goddesses [[Damia]] and [[Auxesia]], which the Aeginetes had carried off from [[Epidaurus|Epidauros]], their parent state.

The Epidaurians had been accustomed to make annual offerings to the Athenian deities [[Athena]] and [[Erechtheus]] in payment for the Athenian olive-wood of which the statues were made. Upon the refusal of the Aeginetes to continue these offerings, the [[Athenians]] endeavoured to carry away the images. Their design was miraculously frustrated &amp;ndash; according to the Aeginetan version, the statues fell upon their knees &amp;ndash; and only a single survivor returned to Athens, there to fall a victim to the fury of his comrades' widows, who pierced him with their brooch-pins. No date is assigned by Herodotus for this ''old feud''; recent writers, e.g. [[J. B. Bury]] and R. W. Macan, suggest the period between Solon and Peisistratus, circa 570 BC. It may be questioned, however, whether the whole episode is not mythical. A critical analysis of the narrative seems to reveal little else than a series of aetiological traditions (explanatory of cults and customs, e.g. of the kneeling posture of the images of Damia and Auxesia, of the use of native ware instead of Athenian in their worship, and of the change in women's dress at Athens from the Dorian to the [[Ionia]]n style.

[[File:Temple of Aphaea.jpg|thumb|The [[Temple of Aphaea]].]]

The account which Herodotus gives of the hostilities between the two states in the early years of the 5th century BC is to the following effect. [[Ancient Thebes (Boeotia)|Thebes]], after the defeat by Athens about 507 BC, appealed to Aegina for assistance. The Aeginetans at first contented themselves with sending the images of the [[Aeacidae]], the [[tutelary deity|tutelary heroes]] of their island. Subsequently, however, they entered into an alliance, and ravaged the seaboard of Attica. The Athenians were preparing to make reprisals, in spite of the advice of the [[Delphic oracle]] that they should desist from attacking Aegina for thirty years, and content themselves meanwhile with dedicating a precinct to [[Aeacus]], when their projects were interrupted by the [[Sparta]]n intrigues for the restoration of [[Hippias]].

In 501 BC Aegina was one of the states which gave the symbols of submission (''earth and water'') to [[Achaemenid Persia]]. Athens at once appealed to Sparta to punish this act of [[medism]], and [[Cleomenes I]], one of the Spartan kings, crossed over to the island, to arrest those who were responsible for it. His attempt was at first unsuccessful; but, after the deposition of [[Demaratus]], he visited the island a second time, accompanied by his new colleague [[Leotychides]], seized ten of the leading citizens and deposited them at Athens as hostages.

After the death of Cleomenes and the refusal of the Athenians to restore the hostages to Leotychides, the Aeginetans retaliated by seizing a number of Athenians at a festival at [[Sunium]]. Thereupon the Athenians concerted a plot with [[Nicodromus]], the leader of the democratic party in the island, for the betrayal of Aegina. He was to seize the old city, and they were to come to his aid on the same day with seventy vessels. The plot failed owing to the late arrival of the Athenian force, when [[Nicodromus]] had already fled the island. An engagement followed in which the Aeginetans were defeated. Subsequently, however, they succeeded in winning a victory over the Athenian fleet.

All the incidents subsequent to the appeal of Athens to Sparta are expressly referred by Herodotus to the interval between the sending of the heralds in 491 BC and the invasion of [[Datis]] and [[Artaphernes]] in 490 BC (cf. Herod. vi. 49 with 94).

There are difficulties in this story, of which the following are the principal elements: &amp;ndash;
*(i.) Herodotus nowhere states or implies that peace was concluded between the two states before 481 BC, nor does he distinguish between different wars during this period. Hence it would follow that the war lasted from shortly after 507 BC down to the congress at the [[Isthmus of Corinth]] in 481 BC
*(ii.) It is only for two years (490 and 491) out of the twenty-five that any details are given. It is the more remarkable that no incidents are recorded in the period between [[battle of Marathon|Marathon]] and [[Battle of Salamis|Salamis]], since at the time of the Isthmian Congress the war is described as the most important one then being waged in Greece (Herod. vii. 145).
*(iii.) It is improbable that Athens would have sent twenty vessels to the aid of the Ionians in 499 BC if at the time she was at war with Aegina. (iv.) There is an incidental indication of time, which points to the period after Marathon as the true date for the events which are referred by Herodotus to the year before Marathon, viz. the thirty years that were to elapse between the dedication of the precinct to Aeacus and the final victory of Athens (Herod. v. 89).

[[File:Temple of Apollo at Aegina03.jpg|thumb|left|The ruins of the Temple of Apollo.]]

As the final victory of Athens over Aegina was in 458 B.C., the thirty years of the oracle would carry us back to the year 488 BC as the date of the dedication of the precinct and the outbreak of hostilities. This inference is supported by the date of the building of the 200 triremes ''for the war against Aegina'' on the advice of [[Themistocles]], which is given in the ''Constitution of Athens'' as 483-482 BC (Herod. vii. 144; [[Ath. Pol.]] r2. 7). It is probable, therefore, that Herodotus is in error both in tracing back the beginning of hostilities to an alliance between Thebes and Aegina (c. 507 BC) and in putting the episode of Nicodromus before Marathon.

Overtures were unquestionably made by Thebes for an alliance with Aegina c. 507 BC, but they came to nothing. The refusal of Aegina was veiled under the diplomatic form of ''sending the Aeacidae.'' The real occasion of the outbreak of the war was the refusal of Athens to restore the hostages some twenty years later. There was but one war, and it lasted from 488 to 481. That Athens had the worst of it in this war is certain.

Herodotus had no Athenian victories to record after the initial success, and the fact that Themistocles was able to carry his proposal to devote the surplus funds of the state to the building of so large a fleet seems to imply that the Athenians were themselves convinced that a supreme effort was necessary.

It may be noted, in confirmation of this view, that the naval supremacy of Aegina is assigned by the ancient writers on chronology to precisely this period, i.e. the years 490-480 ([[Eusebius of Caesarea|Eusebius]], Chron. Can. p.&amp;nbsp;337).

===Decline ===
In the repulse of [[Xerxes I]] it is possible that the Aeginetans played a larger part than is conceded to them by Herodotus. The Athenian tradition, which he follows in the main, would naturally seek to obscure their services. It was to Aegina rather than Athens that the prize of valour at Salamis was awarded, and the destruction of the Persian fleet appears to have been as much the work of the Aeginetan contingent as of the Athenian (Herod. viii. 91). There are other indications, too, of the importance of the Aeginetan fleet in the Greek scheme of defence. In view of these considerations it becomes difficult to credit the number of the vessels that is assigned to them by Herodotus (30 as against 180 Athenian vessels, cf. [[Greek History]], sect. Authorities). During the next twenty years the Philo-Laconian policy of [[Cimon]] secured Aegina, as a member of the Spartan league, from attack. The change in Athenian foreign policy, which was consequent upon the ostracism of Cimon in 461, led to what is sometimes called the First Peloponnesian War, in which the brunt of the fighting fell upon Corinth and Aegina. The latter state was forced to surrender to Athens after a siege, and to accept the position of a subject-ally (c. 456 BC). The tribute was fixed at 30 talents.

By the terms of the [[Thirty Years' Peace]] (445 BC) Athens covenanted to restore to Aegina her autonomy, but the clause remained a dead letter. In the first winter of the [[Peloponnesian War]] (431 BC) Athens expelled the Aeginetans and established a [[cleruchy]] in their island. The exiles were settled by Sparta in [[Thyreatis]], on the frontiers of Laconia and Argolis. Even in their new home they were not safe from Athenian rancour. A force landed under [[Nicias]] in 424, and put most of them to the sword. At the end of the Peloponnesian War [[Lysander]] restored the scattered remnants of the old inhabitants to the island, which was used by the Spartans as a base for operations against Athens in the [[Corinthian War]]. Its greatness, however, was at an end. The part which it plays henceforward is insignificant.

It would be a mistake to attribute the fall of Aegina solely to the development of the [[Athenian navy]]. It is probable that the power of Aegina had steadily declined during the twenty years after Salamis, and that it had declined absolutely, as well as relatively, to that of Athens. Commerce was the source of Aegina's greatness, and her trade, which appears to have been principally with the Levant, must have suffered seriously from the war with Persia. Her medism in 491 is to be explained by her commercial relations with the Persian Empire. She was forced into patriotism in spite of herself, and the glory won by [[Battle of Salamis|Salamis]] was paid for by the loss of her trade and the decay of her marine. The completeness of the ruin of so powerful a state finds an explanation in the economic conditions of the island, the prosperity of which rested upon a basis of slave-labour. It is impossible, indeed, to accept Aristotle's (cf. Athenaeus vi. 272) estimate of 470,000 as the number of the slave-population; it is clear, however, that the number must have been out of all proportion to that of the free inhabitants. In this respect the history of Aegina does but anticipate the history of Greece as a whole. The constitutional history of Aegina is unusually simple. So long as the island retained its independence the government was an [[oligarchy]]. There is no trace of the heroic monarchy and no tradition of a [[tyrrany|tyranny]]. The story of Nicodromus, while it proves the existence of a democratic party, suggests, at the same time, that it could count upon little support.

Pericles called Aegina the ''eyesore'' (leme) of the [[Peiraeus]].

=== Hellenistic period and Roman rule ===
{{Expand section|date=April 2010}}
Aegina passed with the rest of Greece under the successive domination of [[Macedon]], the [[Aetolian League|Aetolians]], [[Attalus I|Attalus of Pergamum]] and [[Roman Empire|Rome]]. A Jewish community is believed to have been established in Aegina &quot;at the end of the second and during the third century AD&quot; by Jews fleeing the [[Barbarian Invasions]] of the time in Greece.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite sign|title=Mosaic floor of a Jewish synagogue|url= |date= |medium=Sign|distributor=[[Archaeological Museum of Aegina]]|location=[[Aegina]], Greece}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Byzantine period ===
Aegina belonged of the East Roman (Byzantine) Empire after the division of the Roman Empire in 395. It remained in Byzantine hands during the period of crisis in the 7th–8th centuries, when most of the [[Balkans]] and the Greek mainland were overrun by [[Slavs|Slavic]] invasions. Indeed, according to the ''[[Chronicle of Monemvasia]]'', the island served as a refuge for the Corinthians fleeing these incursions.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODB40&quot;&gt;Kazhdan (1991), p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; The island flourished in the early 9th century, as evidenced by church construction activity, but suffered greatly from Arab raids originating from [[Emirate of Crete|Crete]]. During that time, the population sought refuge in the island's interior, establishing the settlement of Palaia Chora.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODB40&quot;/&gt;

According to the 12th-century bishop of Athens, [[Michael Choniates]], the island had become a base for pirates.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODB40&quot;/&gt; This is corroborated by [[Benedict of Peterborough]]'s graphic account of Greece, as it was in 1191, where he states that many of the islands were uninhabited from fear of pirates and that Aegina, along with Salamis and Makronesos were their strongholds.

=== Frankish rule after 1204 ===
{{See|Frangokratia}}
After the dissolution and partition of the Byzantine Empire by the [[Fourth Crusade]] in 1204, Aegina was accorded to the [[Republic of Venice]]. In the event, it came under the control of the [[Duchy of Athens]]. The [[Catalan Company]] seized control of Athens, and with it Aegina, in 1317, and in 1425 the island came under Venetian control,&lt;ref&gt;Kazhdan (1991), pp. 40–41&lt;/ref&gt; when Alioto Caopena, at that time ruler of Aegina, placed himself with treaty under the Republic's protection in order to escape the danger of a Turkish raid. The island must then have been fruitful, for one of the conditions under which Venice accorded him her protection, was that he should supply grain to her colonies. He agreed to surrender the island to Venice if his family became extinct. [[Antonio II Acciaioli]] was against the treaty for one of his adopted daughters had married the future lord of Aegina, Antonello Caopena.

=== Venetians in Aegina (1451–1537) ===
In 1451, Aegina became Venetian. The islanders welcomed the Venetian rule; the claims of Antonello’ s uncle Arnà, who had lands in [[Argolis]], were satisfied by a pension. A Venetian governor (''[[rettore]]'') was appointed, who was dependent on the authorities of Nauplia. After Arnà's death, his son Alioto renewed his claim to the island but was told that the republic was firmly resolved to keep it. He and his family were pensioned and one of them aided in the defence of Aegina against the Turks, in 1537, was captured with his family and died in a Turkish dungeon.

Ιn 1463 came the [[Ottoman–Venetian War (1463–1479)|Turco-Venetian war]], which was destined to cost the Venetians [[Negroponte]], most of the [[Cyclades]] and their colonies in the [[Morea]]. Peace was concluded in 1479. Venice still retained Aegina, Lepanto, Nauplia, [[Monemvasia]], [[Coron]], [[Modon]], [[Navarino]], [[Crete]], [[Mykonos]] and [[Tenos]]. Aegina remained subject of Nauplia.

====Administration====
{{cleanup|section|date=July 2007}}
Aegina obtained money for her defences by the unwilling sacrifice of her cherished relic, the head of St. George, which had been carried there from Livadia by the Catalans. In 1462, the Venetian Senate ordered the relic to be removed to St. Giorgio Maggiore in Venice. On 12 November, it was transported from Aegina, by [[Vettore Cappello]], the famous Venetian commander. The Senate gave the Aeginetans 100 [[ducat]]s apiece towards fortifying the island.

In 1519, the government was reformed. The system of having two rectors was found to lead in frequent quarrels and the republic thenceforth sent out a single official styled [[Bailie and Captain]], assisted by two [[councilor]]s, who performed the duties of [[camerlengo]] by turns. The Bailie’ s authority extended over the rector of Aegina, whereas [[Kastri]] (opposite [[Hydra, Saronic Islands|Hydra]]) had been granted to two families, the [[Palaiologoi]] and the [[Alberti]].

A democratic wave passed over the colony. Society at Nauplia was divided into 3 classes: ''nobles, citizens and plebeians''; and it had been the ancient usage that the nobles alone should hold the much-coveted local offices, such as the judge of the inferior court ad inspector of weights and measures. The populace now demanded its share and the Home Government ordered that at least one of the 3 [[inspectors]] should be a man of the people.

Aegina had always been exposed to the raids of the [[corsairs]] and was cursed with oppressive governors during these last 30&amp;nbsp;years of Venetian rule. Venetian nobles weren't willing to go to this island. In 1533, three rectors of Aegina were punished for their acts of injustice and we have a graphic account of the reception given by the Aeginetans to the [[captain of Nauplia]], who came to hold and enquiry into the administration of these delinquents. ''[Vid. Inscription over the entrance of St. George the Catholic in Paliachora.]'' The rectors had spurned their ancient right to elect islander to keep one key of the money-chest. They had also threatened to leave the island in a body with the commissioner, unless the captain avenged their wrongs.
In order to spare the pockets of the community, it was ordered that appeals from the governor’ s decision should lie to Crete, instead of Venice. The republic should pay a bakshish to the Turkish governor of the Morea and to the [[Voevode]] who was stationed at the frontier of [[Thermisi]] (opposite Hydra). The fortifications too, were allowed to fall into despair and were inadequately guarded.

====16th century====
{{cleanup|section|date=July 2007}}
After the fall of the Duchy of Athens and the [[principality of Achaia]], the only Latin possessions left on the mainland of Greece were the papal city of Monemvasia, the fortress of [[Vonitsa]], the Messenian stations Coron and Modon, Navarino, the castles of Argos and Nauplia, to which the island of Aegina was subordinate, Lepanto and [[Pteleon]].

In 1502/03, the new peace left Venice with nothing but Cephalonia, Monemvasia and Nauplia, with their appurtenances in the Morea. And against the sack of Megara, she had to set the temporary capture of the castle of Aegina by [[Kemal Reis]] and the carrying off of 2000 Aeginetans. This treaty was renewed in 1513 and 1521. All the supplies of grain of Nauplia and Monemvasia had now to be imported from the Turkish possessions, while corsairs rendered dangerous all traffic by sea.

In 1537, [[Suleyman the Magnificent]] declared war upon Venice and his admiral [[Hayreddin Barbarossa]] spread fire and sword upon the [[Ionian Islands]] and in October fell upon the island of Aegina. On the 4th day [[Palaiochora]] fell, but the church of St George (Latin church) was spared. He massacred all the adult male population and took away 6000 women and children as slaves. So complete was the destruction of the Aeginetans, that when a French admiral, [[Baron de Blancard]], touched the island soon afterwards, he found it devoid of inhabitants.

There, as usual, an Albanian immigration replenished, at least to some extent, the devastated sites, but Aegina couldn’t recover its former prosperity. Thence Barbarossa sailed to Naxos, whence he carried off an immense booty, compelling the Duke of Naxos to purchase his further independence by a tribute of 5000 ducats.

With the [[peace of 1540]], Venice ceded Nauplia and Monemvasia. For nearly 150&amp;nbsp;years after, Venice did not own an inch of soil on the mainland of Greece, except the Ionian dependencies of Parga and Butrinto, but of her insular dominions [[Cyprus]], Crete, [[Tenos]] and 6 Ionian islands still remained.

=== First Ottoman period (1540–1687) ===
Attack and desolation of the island by [[Francesco Morosini]] during the [[Cretan War (1645–1669)|Cretan War]] (1654).

=== Second Venetian period (1687–1715) ===
In 1684, the outbreak of the [[Morean War]] between Venice and the [[Ottoman Empire]] led to the temporary re-conquest of a large part of the country by the Republic. In 1687 the Venetian army arrived in Piraeus and took command of Attica. The number of the Athenians at that time exceeded 6000, the Albanians from the villages of Attica excluded, and whilst in 1674 the population of Aegina did not seem to exceed 3000 inhabitants, 2/3 of which were women. The Aeginetans had been led to seediness to pay their taxes. The most significant plague epidemic though began in Attica in 1688, an occasion that caused the massive migration of all the Athenians toward south; most of them settled in Aegina. In 1693 Morosini resumed the command, but his only acts were to refortify the castle of Aegina, which he had demolished during the Cretan war in 1655, the cost of upkeep being paid, as long as the war lasted, by the Athenian, and to place it and Salamis under Malipiero as Governor. This led the Athenians to send him a request for the renewal of Venetian protection and an offer of an annual tribute. He died in 1694 and Zeno was appointed at his place.

In 1699, thanks to English mediation, the war ended with the [[peace of Karlowitz]] by which Venice retained possession of the 7 Ionian islands, Butrinto and [[Parga]], the Morea, [[Spinalonga]] and [[Suda]], Tenos, [[Santa Maura]] and Aegina and ceased to pay a tribute for [[Zante]], but restored Lepanto to the [[Ottoman sultan]]. The burden of having to contribute to the maintenance of [[Cerigo]] and Aegina, both united administratively with the Morea since the peace, the peninsula not only paid all the expenses of administration, but furnished a substantial balance to the naval defence of Venice, in which it was directly interested.

=== Second Ottoman period (1715–1821) ===
The Ottomans [[Ottoman–Venetian War (1714–1718)|regained]] Aegina along with the Morea in 1715, and remained in control of the island with the exception of a [[Orlov Revolt|short-lived Russian occupation]], until the outbreak of the [[Greek War of Independence]] in 1821. .

===Mythology===
In [[Greek mythology]], '''[[Aegina (mythology)|Aegina]]''' was a daughter of the river god [[Asopus]] and the [[nymph]] [[Metope (mythology)|Metope]]. She bore at least two children: [[Menoetius]] by [[Actor (mythology)|Actor]], and [[Aeacus]] by [[Zeus]]. When Zeus abducted Aegina, he took her to [[Oenone]], an island close to [[Attica]]. This island would later be called Aegina. Here, Aegina gave birth to Aeacus, who would later become king of Oenone; henceforth, the island's name Aegina.

Aegina is the gathering place of Myrmidons, in Aegina they gathered and they trained. Zeus needed an elite army and at first thought that Aegina who at the time did not have any villagers was the perfect place. So he turned the ants ({{lang-el|Μυρμύγκια}}, Myrmigia) into warriors who had 6 hands and wore black armors. Later on Myrmidons were known as the most fearsome fighting unit in [[Greece]] led by [[Achilles]].

An '''aegis''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|iː|dʒ|ɨ|s}}), from [[Greek language|Greek]] αιγίς, is a large collar or cape worn in ancient times to display the protection provided by a high religious authority or the holder of a protective shield signifying the same, such as a bag-like garment that contained a shield. Sometimes the garment and the shield are merged, with a small version of the shield appearing on the garment. It originally was derived from the protective shield associated with a religious figure when related in myths and images. The wearing of the aegis and its contents show sponsorship, protection, or authority derived from yet a higher source or deity. The name has been extended to many other entities, and the concept of a protective shield is found in other mythologies, while its form varies across sources.

Now, the more modern concept of doing something &quot;under someone's ''aegis''&quot; means doing something under the protection of a powerful, knowledgeable, or benevolent source.  The word ''aegis'' is identified with protection by a strong force with its roots in [[Greek mythology]] and adopted by the Romans; there are parallels in [[Norse mythology]] and in [[Egyptian mythology]] as well, where the Greek word ''aegis'' is applied by extension.

==In Greek mythology==

The '''aegis ''' ({{lang-el|Αιγίς}}), as stated in the [[Iliad]], is the [[shield]] or [[buckler]] of [[Athena]] or of [[Zeus]], which according to [[Homer]] was fashioned by [[Hephaestus]]. &quot;...and among them went bright-eyed Athene, holding the precious aegis which is ageless and immortal: a hundred tassels of pure gold hang fluttering from it, tight-woven each of them, and each the worth of a hundred oxen.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Iliad]]'' 2.446-9, (Martin Hammond's translation).&lt;/ref&gt;

Virgil imagines the [[Cyclops|Cyclopes]] in Hephaestus' forge, who &quot;busily burnished the aegis Athene wears in her angry moods--a fearsome thing with a surface of gold like scaly snake-skin, and he linked serpents and the [[Gorgon]] herself upon the goddess's breast—a severed head rolling its eyes.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Aeneid]]'' 8.435-8, (Day-Lewie's translation).&lt;/ref&gt; furnished with golden tassels and bearing the ''[[Gorgoneion]]'' ([[Medusa]]'s head) in the central boss. Some of the [[Attica|Attic]] vase-painters retained an archaic tradition that the tassels had originally been [[Serpent (symbolism)|serpents]] in their representations of the ægis. When the Olympian deities overtook the older deities of Greece and she was born of [[Metis (mythology)|Metis]] (inside [[Zeus]] who had swallowed the goddess) and &quot;re-born&quot; through the head of Zeus fully clothed, Athena already wore her typical garments.

When the Olympian shakes the aegis, [[Mount Ida]] is wrapped in clouds, the thunder rolls and men are struck down with fear.  &quot;Aegis-bearing Zeus&quot;, as he is in the ''Iliad'', sometimes ''lends'' the fearsome goatskin to [[Athena]]. In the ''Iliad'' when  Zeus sends [[Apollo (god)|Apollo]] to revive the wounded [[Hector of Troy]], Apollo, holding the aegis, charges the Achaeans, pushing them back to their ships drawn up on the shore. According to [[Edith Hamilton]]'s ''Mythology: Timeless Tales of Gods and Heroes'',&lt;ref&gt;Part I, section I (Warner Books' United States Paperback Edition)&lt;/ref&gt; the Aegis is [[Zeus]]' [[breastplate]], and was &quot;awful to behold.&quot;

==Locating the aegis==

[[File:Douriscup 83d40m Athene aegisWingedLionessOwl pythonVomitsJason fleeceInTree Vatican.jpg|thumb|Athena's aegis, bearing the Gorgon, here resembles closely the skin of the huge serpent who guards the golden fleece (regurgitating Jason); cup by Douris, Classical Greece, early fifth century BC - [[Vatican Museum]]]]

[[Classical Greece|Greeks of the Classical age]] always detected that there was something alien and uncanny about the aegis. It was supposed by [[Euripides]] (''Ion'', 995) that the [[Gorgon]] was the original possessor of this goatskin,&lt;ref&gt;Noted by Graves 1960, 9.a; [[Karl Kerenyi]], ''The Gods of the Greeks'' 1951, p 50.&lt;/ref&gt; yet the usual understanding&lt;ref&gt;As in Kerenyi 1951:50&lt;/ref&gt;  is that the ''Gorgoneion'' was ''added'' to the aegis, a [[votive gift]] from a grateful [[Perseus]].

There also is the origin myth that represents the ægis as a fire-breathing [[chthonic]] monster similar to the [[Chimera (creature)|Chimera]], which was slain and flayed by [[Athena]], who afterward wore its skin as a [[cuirass]] ([[Diodorus Siculus]] iii. 70), or as a [[chlamys]]. The Douris cup shows that the aegis was represented exactly as the skin of the guardian serpent, with its scales clearly delineated. Often the aegis is described as the bag in which Athene carried her shield and the serpent who was her son.

[[John Tzetzes]] says&lt;ref&gt;[[John Tzetzes]], ''On Lycophron'', 355.&lt;/ref&gt; that it was the skin of the monstrous giant [[Pallas (Giant)|Pallas]] whom Athena overcame and whose name she attached to her own (name).

In a late rendering by [[Gaius Julius Hyginus|Hyginus]], (''Poetical  Astronomy'' ii. 13) Zeus is said to have used the skin of the [[goat]] deity [[Amalthea (mythology)|Amalthea]] (''aigis'' &quot;goat-skin&quot;) which suckled him in [[Crete]], as a shield when he went forth to do battle against the [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]]s. She is thought to bear the name of the deity who was derived from Libya, where known as Neith, the same source sometimes identified as the parallel for Athene.

[[Image:BattleofIssus333BC-mosaic-detail1.jpg|thumb|First century BC [[mosaic]] of Alexander the Great bearing on his [[armor]] an image of the Gorgon as an aegis - ''[[Naples National Archaeological Museum]]'']]

In accordance with this double meaning, the aegis appears in works of art sometimes as an animal's skin thrown over the shoulders and arms, and sometimes as a cuirass, with a border of snakes corresponding to the tassels of Homer, usually with the Gorgon head, the ''gorgoneion'', in the centre.

It often is represented on the statues of [[Roman Empire|Roman]] emperors, heroes, and warriors as well as on cameos and vases. A vestige of that appears in a portrait of [[Alexander the Great]] in a fresco from Pompeii dated to the 1st century BC, which shows the image of the head of a woman on his armor that resembles the Gorgon.

==Origins==
[[Herodotus]] (''Histories'' iv.189) thought he had identified the source of the ægis in [[Libya]], which was always a distant territory of ancient magic for the Greeks:
:''Athene's garments and ægis were borrowed by the Greeks from the Libyan women, who are dressed in exactly the same way, except that their leather garments are fringed with thongs, not serpents.''

[[Robert Graves]] in ''The Greek Myths'' (1955; 1960) asserts that the ægis in its Libyan sense had been a shamanic pouch containing various ritual objects, bearing the device of a monstrous serpent-haired visage with tusk-like teeth and a protruding tongue which was meant to frighten away the uninitiated.  In this context, Graves identifies the aegis as clearly belonging first to Athena.

Another version{{citation needed|date=February 2007}} describes it to have been really the goat's skin used as a belt to support the shield.  When so used it would generally be fastened on the right shoulder, and would partially envelop the chest as it passed obliquely round in front and behind to be attached to the shield under the left arm.  Hence, by [[metonymy]], it would be employed to denote at times the shield which it supported, and at other times a [[cuirass]], or [[chlamys]] , the purpose of which it in part served.  In accordance with this double meaning, the ægis appears in works of art sometimes as an animal's skin thrown over the shoulders and arms, and sometimes as a cuirass, with a border of snakes corresponding to the tassels of Homer, usually with the Gorgon's head, the ''gorgoneion'', in the centre.  It is often represented on the statues of [[Roman Empire|Roman]] emperors, heroes, and warriors, and on cameos and vases.

A current modern interpretation is that the [[Hittites|Hittite]] sacral hieratic hunting bag (''kursas''), a rough and shaggy goatskin that has been firmly established in literary texts and iconography by H.G. Güterbock,&lt;ref&gt;Güterbock, ''Perspectives on Hittite Civilization: Selected Writings'' (Chicago 1997).&lt;/ref&gt; is the most likely source of the aegis.&lt;ref&gt;Calvert Watkins &quot;A Distant Anatolian Echo in Pindar: The Origin of the Aegis Again&quot;, ''Harvard Studies in Classical Philology'' '''100''' (2000), pp. 1-14. [http://www.jstor.org/view/00730688/sp040001/04x0003c/0 on JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Etymology===
[[Greek language|Greek]] Αιγίς has three meanings: 
# &quot;violent windstorm&quot;, from the verb 'αïσσω&lt;ref&gt;to quickly move, to shoot, dart, to put in motion: entry [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0058%3Aentry%3Da)i%2Fssw ἀίσσω ] at [[LSJ]]&lt;/ref&gt; ([[stem (linguistics)|stem]] 'αïγ-) = &quot;I rush or move violently&quot;. Akin to &quot;καταιγίς&quot; ''hurricane''.
# The shield of a deity as described above
# &quot;goatskin coat&quot;, from treating the word as meaning &quot;something grammatically feminine pertaining to [[goat]]&quot; (Greek αἰξ ([[stem (linguistics)|stem]] αἰγ-) = &quot;goat&quot;, + suffix -ίς (stem ίδ-))

The original meaning may have been #1, and Ζευς 'Αιγιοχος = &quot;Zeus who holds the aegis&quot; may have originally meant &quot;Sky/Heaven, who holds the storm&quot;. The transition to the meaning &quot;shield&quot; may have come by [[folk-etymology]] among a people familiar with draping an animal skin over the left arm as a shield.

==In Egyptian and Nubian mythology==

The aegis also appears in Ancient [[Egyptian mythology]]. The goddess [[Bastet (mythology)|Bast]] sometimes was depicted holding a ceremonial [[sistrum]] in one hand and an aegis in the other – the aegis usually resembling a collar or [[gorget]] embellished with a [[lion|lioness]] head. [[Plato]] drew a parallel between Athene and the ancient Libyan and Egyptian goddess [[Neith]], a [[List of war deities|war deity]] who also was depicted carrying a shield.&lt;ref&gt;Plato: ''Timaeus 5&lt;/ref&gt;   

Ancient [[Nubia]] shared many aspects of its mythology with ancient Egypt and there is debate about the original source of some religious concepts that the two cultures share and, whether the assimilation was from Nubia to Egypt, the reverse, or through continuing exchanges. At one time the [[Kingdom of Kush|Kush]] of Nubia ruled ancient Egypt.

The image to the right was discovered in [[Sudan]], which is the contemporary name for the territory of Nubia during the period in which the artifact was made, during the 4th century BC. The figure is that of [[Isis]] and she is wearing an aegis. It is likely to be an artifact of the flourishing culture of [[Meroë]], successors to the culture of Kush, because of the use of [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]] and [[cartouche]]s.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==In Norse mythology==
In [[Norse mythology]], the dragon [[Fafnir]] (best known in the form of a dragon slain by Sigurðr)  bears on his forehead the Ægis-helm (ON ægishjálmr), or Ægir's helmet, or more specifically the &quot;Helm of Terror&quot;. However, some versions would say that Alberich was the one holding a helm, named as the ''Tarnkappe'', which has the power to make the user invisible. It may be an actual helmet or a magical sign with a rather poetic name. ''Ægir'' is an   Old Norse word meaning &quot;terror&quot; and the name of a destructive giant associated with the sea; ''ægis'' is the [[genitive]] (possessive) form of ''ægir'' and has no direct relation to Greek  ''aigis''.

[[Image:Murder Aegisthus Louvre K320.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Aegisthus being murdered by [[Orestes (mythology)|Orestes]] &amp;mdash; [[Louvre]].]]

In [[Greek mythology]], '''Aegisthus''' ([[Ancient Greek language|Ancient Greek]]: {{polytonic|Αἴγισθος}} &lt;!-- unreferenced/folk etymology &quot;[[Domestic goat|goat]] [[Physical strength|strength]]&quot;--&gt;; also [[Transliteration|transliterated]] as '''Aegisthos''') was the son of [[Thyestes]] and of Thyestes' daughter, [[Pelopia]].

Thyestes felt he had been deprived of the [[Mycenae|Mycenean]] throne unfairly by his brother, [[Atreus]].  The two battled back and forth several times.  In addition, Thyestes had an affair with Atreus' wife, [[Aerope]]. In revenge, Atreus killed Thyestes' sons and served them to him unknowingly.  After eating his own sons' corpses, Thyestes asked an [[oracle]] how best to gain revenge.  The advice was to father a son with his own daughter, Pelopia, and that son would kill Atreus.

When Aegisthus was born, his mother was ashamed of her incestuous act.  She [[Abandonment|abandoned]] him and he was raised by shepherds and suckled by a goat, whence his name Aegisthus (from {{polytonic|αἴξ}}).&lt;ref&gt;[[Gaius Julius Hyginus|Hyginus]], ''Fabulae'' 87, 88;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Claudius Aelianus|Aelian]], ''[[Claudius Aelianus#Varia Historia (Ποικίλη Ιστορία)|Varia Historia]]'' xii. 42&lt;/ref&gt;  Atreus, not knowing the baby's origin, took Aegisthus in and raised him as his own son.

In the night in which Pelopia had shared the bed of her father, she had taken from him his [[sword]] which she afterwards gave to Aegisthus. This sword became the means by which the [[incest]]uous intercourse between her and her father was discovered, whereupon she [[suicide|put an end]] to her own life. Atreus in his enmity towards his brother sent Aegisthus to kill him; but the sword which Aegisthus carried was the cause of the recognition between Thyestes and his son, and the latter returned and slew his uncle Atreus, while he was offering a sacrifice on the seacoast.  Aegisthus and his father now took possession of their lawful inheritance from which they had been expelled by Atreus.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gaius Julius Hyginus|Hyginus]], ''l.c.'' and 252.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aegisthus and Thyestes thereafter ruled over [[Mycenae]] jointly, exiling Atreus' sons, [[Agamemnon]] and [[Menelaus]] to [[Sparta]], where King [[Tyndareus]] gave the pair his daughters, [[Clytemnestra]] and [[Helen]], to take as wives.

[[Homer]] appears to know nothing of all these tragic occurrences, and we learn from him only that, after the death of Thyestes, Aegisthus ruled as king at Mycenae and took no part in the Trojan expedition.&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer]], ''[[Odyssey]]'' iv. 518, &amp;c.&lt;/ref&gt;  While [[Agamemnon]], the son of Atreus, was absent on his expedition against Troy, Aegisthus seduced [[Clytemnestra]], the wife of Agamemnon, and was so wicked as to offer up thanks to the gods for the success with which his criminal exertions were crowned.&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer]], ''[[Odyssey]]'' iii. 263, &amp;c.&lt;/ref&gt;  In order not to be surprised by the return of Agamemnon, he sent out spies, and when Agamemnon came, Aegisthus invited him to a repast at which he had him treacherously murdered.&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer]], ''[[Odyssey]]'' iv. 524, &amp;c.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ii. 16. § 5.&lt;/ref&gt;  After this event Aegisthus reigned seven years longer over Mycenae, until in the eighth [[Orestes (mythology)|Orestes]], the son of Agamemnon, returned home and avenged the death of his father by putting the adulterer to death.&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer]], ''[[Odyssey]]'' i. 28, &amp;c.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

'''Aelia Capitolina''' ([[Latin language|Latin]] in full: ''Colonia Aelia Capitolina'') was a city built by the emperor [[Hadrian]], and occupied by a [[Roman colony]], on the site of [[Jerusalem]], which was in ruins since [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|70 AD]], leading in part to the [[Bar Kokhba revolt]] of 132–136.

==Politics==
[[Jerusalem]] was still in ruins from the [[First Jewish-Roman War]] in 70 AD. [[Josephus]], a contemporary, reports that &quot;Jerusalem  ... was so thoroughly razed to the ground by those that demolished it to its foundations, that nothing was left that could ever persuade visitors that it had once been a place of habitation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, ''Jewish War'', 7:1:1&lt;/ref&gt;

When Emperor Hadrian vowed to rebuild Jerusalem from the wreckage in 130 C.E., he considered reconstructing Jerusalem as a gift for the Jewish people. The Jews awaited with hope, because Hadrian was considered a moderate.  But after Hadrian visited Jerusalem, he decided to build Aelia Capitolina which would be inhabited by his legionnaires.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Isaac, ''The Near East under Roman Rule: Selected Papers'' (Leiden: Brill 1998)&lt;/ref&gt;  Hadrian also decided to never allow Jews to re-enter the city ever again.  Fundamentalist Jews, incensed at this harsh decree, secretly started putting aside arms from the Roman munitions workshops; soon after, a revolt broke out under [[Simeon ben Kosiba]]. This [[Bar Kokhba revolt]], which the Romans managed to suppress, enraged Hadrian, and he came to be determined to erase Judaism from the province; [[Iudaea province]] was renamed [[Syria Palaestina]], and Jews were banned from entering the city, on pain of death, except on the day of [[Tisha B'Av]]. The [[Sanhedrin]] had earlier relocated to [[Council of Jamnia|Jamnia]]. Hadrian's new plans included temples to the major regional deities, and certain Roman gods, in particular [[Jupiter Capitolinus]]; the city had formerly been the single Holy City of most forms of Judaism, see also [[Jerusalem in Judaism]].
===The Christian church of Jerusalem after 135===
According to [[Eusebius]], the [[Jerusalem church]] was scattered twice, in AD70 and AD135, with the difference that from 70-130 the bishops of Jerusalem have evidently Jewish names, wheras after 135 the bishops of [[Aelia Capitolina]] appear to be Greeks.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Jerusalem in Early Christian Thought&quot; p75 ''Explorations in a Christian theology of pilgrimage'' ed Craig G. Bartholomew, Fred Hughes&lt;/ref&gt; Eusebius' evidence for continuation of a church at Aelia Capitolina is confirmed by the [[Bordeaux Pilgrim]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard Bauckham &quot;The Christian Community of Aelia Capitolina&quot; in ''The Book of Acts in Its Palestinian Setting''  p310.&lt;/ref&gt; 


==Name==

[[Image:Madaba map.jpg|thumb|150px|left|The [[Madaba Map]] depiction of 6th-century [[Jerusalem]] has the ''[[Cardo]] Maximus'', the town’s main street, beginning at the northern gate, today's [[Gates in Jerusalem's Old City Walls|Damascus Gate]], and traversing the city in a straight line from north to south to [[Nea Church]].]]
''Aelia'' came from Hadrian's ''[[Roman naming convention|nomen gentile]]'', ''[[Aelia (gens)|Aelius]]'', while ''Capitolina'' meant that the new city was dedicated to ''[[Jupiter (god)|Jupiter]] [[Capitoline Hill|Capitolinus]]'', to whom a temple was built on the site of the former [[Jewish temple]], the [[Temple Mount]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Aelia_Capitolina/ Encyclopaedia Britannica 11th Edition]&lt;/ref&gt; The city was without walls, protected by a light garrison of the [[Legio X Fretensis|Tenth Legion]], during the Late Roman Period. The detachment at [[Jerusalem]], which apparently encamped all over the city’s western hill, was responsible for preventing [[Jew]]s from returning to the city. Roman enforcement of this prohibition continued through the 4th century. The Latin name ''Aelia'' is the source of the [[Arabic Language|Arabic]] term Iliyā' (إلياء), an early [[Islam]]ic name for Jerusalem.

==Plan of the city==
[[File:Roman Jerusalem.PNG|thumb|200px|right|The two pairs of main roads - the cardines (north-south) and decumani (east-west) - in Aelia Capitolina.]]
The urban plan of Aelia Capitolina was that of a typical [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] town wherein main thoroughfares crisscrossed the [[Urban planning|urban grid]] lengthwise and widthwise.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jeru.huji.ac.il/ed22.htm The Cardo] Hebrew University&lt;/ref&gt; The urban grid was based on the usual central north-south road (''[[cardo]]'') and central east-west route (''[[decumanus]]''). However, as the main cardo ran up the western hill, and the [[Temple Mount]] blocked the eastward route of the main decumanus, a second pair of main roads was added; the secondary cardo ran down the [[tyropoean valley]], and the secondary decumanus ran just to the north of the temple mount. The main Hadrianic cardo terminated not far beyond its junction with the decumanus, where it reached the Roman garrison's encampment, but in the Byzantine era it was extended over the former camp to reach the southern walls of the city. 

The two cardines converged near the ''[[Damascus Gate]]'', and a semicircular [[piazza]] covered the remaining space; in the piazza a columnar monument was constructed, hence the traditional name for the gate - ''Bab el-Amud'' (''Gate of the Column'').  [[Tetrapylon]] were constructed at the other junctions between the main roads.  

This street pattern has been preserved through Jerusalem's later history; the western cardo is Suq Khan ez-Zeit (''Olive-oil Inn Market''), the southern decumanus is both the Street of the Chain and Suq el-Bazaar (''Bazaar Market''; called ''David Street'' by [[State of Israel|Israelis]]), the eastern cardo is Al-wad Road (''Valley road''), and the northern decumanus is now the [[Via Dolorosa]]. The original thoroughfare, flanked by rows of columns and shops, was about 73 feet (22 meters) wide (roughly the equivalent of a present-day six lane motorway), but buildings have extended onto the streets over the centuries, and the modern lanes replacing the ancient grid are now quite narrow. The substantial remains of the western cardo have now been exposed to view near the junction with Suq el-Bazaar, and remnants of one of the tetrapylon are preserved in the 19th century [[Franciscan]] chapel at the junction of the Via Dolorosa and Suq Khan ez-Zeit.

As was standard for new Roman cities, Hadrian placed the city's main [[Roman Forum|Forum]] at the junction of the main cardo and decumanus, now the location for the (smaller) [[Muristan]]. Adjacent to the Forum, at the junction of the same cardo, and the other decumanus, Hadrian built a large temple to the [[goddess]] [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], which later became the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]]; despite 11th century destruction, which resulted in the modern Church having a much smaller footprint, several boundary walls of Hadrian's temple have been found among the archaeological remains beneath the Church.&lt;ref&gt;[[Virgilio Canio Corbo|Virgilio Corbo]], ''The Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem'' (1981)&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Struthion Pool]]'' lay in the path of the northern decumanus, so Hadrian placed [[vault (architecture)|vaulting]] over it, added a large pavement on top, and turned it into a secondary Forum;&lt;ref name=&quot;benoit&quot;&gt;[[Pierre Benoit (archaeologist)|Pierre Benoit]], ''The Archaeological Reconstruction of the Antonia Fortress'', in ''Jerusalem Revealed'' (edited by [[Yigael Yadin]]), (1976)&lt;/ref&gt; the pavement can still be seen under the [[Convent of the Sisters of Zion]].&lt;ref name=&quot;benoit&quot; /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{for|the Roman writer|Claudius Aelianus}}
'''Aelianus Tacticus''' ({{lang-el|{{polytonic|Αἰλιανός ὁ Τακτικός}}}}) was a [[Hellenistic Greece|Greek]] [[military]] writer of the 2nd century, resident at [[ancient Rome|Rome]]. 

Aelian's military treatise in fifty-three chapters on the tactics of the Greeks, titled &quot;On Tactical Arrays of the Greeks&quot; ({{polytonic|Περί Στρατηγικών Τάξεων Ελληνικών}}), is dedicated to [[Hadrian]], though this is probably a mistake for [[Trajan]], and the date 106 has been assigned to it.  It is a handbook of Greek, i.e. [[Macedon]]ian, [[parade (military)|drill]] and [[military tactics|tactics]] as practiced by the [[Hellenistic Greece|Hellenistic]] successors of [[Alexander the Great]].  The author claims to have consulted all the best authorities, the most important of which was a lost treatise on the subject by [[Polybius]]. Perhaps the chief value of Aelian's work lies in his critical account of preceding works on the art of [[war]], and in the fullness of his technical details in matters of drill.  

He also gives a brief account of the constitution of a Roman army at that time. The work arose, he says, from a conversation he had with the emperor [[Nerva]] at [[Frontinus]]'s house at [[Formiae]]. He promises a work on Naval Tactics also; but this, if it was written, is lost.&lt;ref name=&quot;dgrbm&quot;&gt;{{Citation

Critics of the 18th century &amp;mdash; Guichard Folard and the Prince de Ligne &amp;mdash; were unanimous in thinking Aelian greatly inferior to [[Arrian]], but Aelian exercised a great influence both on his immediate successors, the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]]s, and later on the [[Arab]]s, (who translated the text for their own use). Emperor [[Leo VI the Wise]] incorporated much of Aelian's text in his own work on the military art (Τέχνη Τακτική). The Arabic version of Aelian was made about 1350. It was first translated into Latin by Theodoras of Thessalonica, published in 1487.&lt;ref name=&quot;dgrbm&quot;/&gt;

In spite of its academic nature, the copious details to be found in the treatise rendered it of the highest value to the army organizers of the 16th century, who were engaged in fashioning a regular military system out of the semi-[[feudal]] systems of previous generations.  The [[Macedonian phalanx]] of Aelian had many points of resemblance to the solid masses of [[pikemen]] and the [[Squadron (cavalry)|squadrons]] of [[cavalry]] of the [[Spain|Spanish]] and [[Netherlands|Dutch]] systems, and the translations made in the 16th century formed the groundwork of numerous books on drill and tactics.  

Moreover, his works, with those of [[Xenophon]], [[Polybius]], [[Onasander]], [[Aeneas Tacticus]] and [[Arrian]], were minutely studied by every soldier of the 16th and 17th centuries who wished to be master of his profession. It has been suggested that Aelian was the real author of most of Arrian's ''Tactica'', and that the ''Taktike Theoria'' is a later revision of this original, but the theory is not generally accepted.

[[File:novAAseries.jpg|thumb|450px|Modern atomic absorption spectrometers]]

'''Atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS)''' is a spectroanalytical procedure for the qualitative and quantitative determination of chemical elements employing the absorption of optical radiation (light) by free atoms in the gaseous state. In analytical chemistry the technique is used for determining the concentration of a particular element (the analyte) in a sample to be analyzed. AAS can be used to determine over 70 different elements in solution or directly in solid samples.
Atomic absorption spectrometry was first used as an analytical technique, and the underlying principles were established in the second half of the 19th century by [[Robert Wilhelm Bunsen]] and [[Gustav Robert Kirchhoff]], both professors at the [[University of Heidelberg]], Germany. The modern form of AAS was largely developed during the 1950s by a team of Australian Chemists. They were led by Sir Alan Walsh at the [[CSIRO]] (Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization), Division of Chemical Physics, in Melbourne, Australia.

== Principles ==
The technique makes use of absorption spectrometry to assess the concentration of an analyte in a sample. It requires standards with known analyte content to establish the relation between the measured absorbance and the analyte concentration and relies therefore on [[Beer-Lambert Law]].
In short, the electrons of the atoms in the atomizer can be promoted to higher orbitals (excited state) for a short period of time (nanoseconds) by absorbing a defined quantity of energy (radiation of a given [[wavelength]]). This amount of energy, i.e., wavelength, is specific to a particular electron transition in a particular element. In general, each wavelength corresponds to only one element, and the width of an absorption line is only of the order of a few picometers (pm), which gives the technique its elemental selectivity.
The [[radiation flux]] without a sample and with a sample in the atomizer is measured using a detector, and the ratio between the two values (the absorbance) is converted to analyte concentration or mass using Beer-Lambert Law.

== Instrumentation == 
[[Image:AASBLOCK.JPG‎|thumb|250px|Atomic absorption spectrometer block diagram]]
In order to analyze a sample for its atomic constituents, it has to be atomized.  The atomizers most commonly used nowadays are flames and electrothermal (graphite tube) atomizers. The atoms should then be irradiated by optical radiation, and the radiation source could be an element-specific line radiation source or a continuum radiation source. The radiation then passes through a [[monochromator]] in order to separate the element-specific radiation from any other radiation emitted by the radiation source, which is finally measured by a detector.

=== Atomizers ===
Although other atomizers, such as heated quartz tubes, might be used for special purposes, the atomizers most commonly used nowadays are (spectroscopic) flames and electrothermal (graphite tube) atomizers.

==== Flame atomizers ====
The oldest and most commonly used atomizers in AAS are flames, principally the air-acetylene flame with a temperature of about 2300 °C and the nitrous oxide (N2O)-acetylene flame with a temperature of about 2700 °C. The latter flame, in addition, offers a more reducing environment, being ideally suited for analytes with high affinity to oxygen.

Liquid or dissolved samples are typically used with flame atomizers. The sample solution is aspirated by a pneumatic nebulizer, transformed into an [[aerosol]], which is introduced into a spray chamber, where it is mixed with the flame gases and conditioned in a way that only the finest aerosol droplets (&lt; 10 μm) enter the flame. This conditioning process is responsible that only about 5% of the aspirated sample solution reaches the flame, but it also guarantees a relatively high freedom from interference. 

On top of the spray chamber is a burner head that produces a flame that is laterally long (usually 5–10 cm) and only a few mm deep. The radiation beam passes through this flame at its longest axis, and the flame gas flow-rates may be adjusted to produce the highest concentration of free atoms. The burner height may also be adjusted, so that the radiation beam passes through the zone of highest atom cloud density in the flame, resulting in the highest sensitivity.

The processes in a flame include the following stages:

* Desolvation (drying) – the solvent is evaporated and the dry sample nano-particles remain;

* [[Vaporization]] (transfer to the gaseous phase) – the solid particles are converted into gaseous molecules;

* Atomization – the molecules are dissociated into free atoms;

* [[Ionization]] – depending on the ionization potential of the analyte atoms and the energy available in a particular flame, atoms might be in part converted to gaseous ions. 

Each of these stages includes the risk of interference in case the degree of phase transfer is different for the analyte in the calibration standard and in the sample. Ionization is generally undesirable, as it reduces the number of atoms that is available for measurement, i.e., the sensitivity.
In flame AAS a steady-state signal is generated during the time period when the sample is aspirated. This technique is typically used for determinations in the mg L-1 range, and may be extended down to a few μg L-1 for some elements.

==== Electrothermal atomizers ====
[[Graphite furnace atomic absorption|Electrothermal AAS]] (ET AAS) using graphite tube atomizers was pioneered by Boris V. L’vov at the [[Saint Petersburg Polytechnical University|Saint Petersburg Polytechnical Institute]], Russia, since the late 1950s, and further investigated by Hans Massmann at the Institute of Spectrochemistry and Applied Spectroscopy (ISAS) in Dortmund, Germany.

Although a wide variety of graphite tube designs have been used over the years, the dimensions nowadays are typically 20–25 mm in length and 5–6 mm inner diameter. With this technique liquid/dissolved, solid and gaseous samples may be analyzed directly. A measured volume (typically 10–50 μL) or a weighed mass (typically around 1 mg) of a solid sample are introduced into the graphite tube and subject to a temperature program. This typically consists of stages, such as:

* Drying – the solvent is evaporated

* [[Pyrolysis]] – the majority of the matrix constituents is removed

* Atomization – the analyte element is released to the gaseous phase

* Cleaning – eventual residues in the graphite tube are removed at high temperature.

The graphite tubes are heated via their ohmic resistance using a low-voltage high-current power supply; the temperature in the individual stages can be controlled very closely, and temperature ramps between the individual stages facilitate separation of sample components. Tubes may be heated transversely or longitudinally, where the former ones have the advantage of a more homogeneous temperature distribution over their length. The so-called [[STPF|Stabilized Temperature Platform Furnace]] (STPF) concept, proposed by Walter Slavin, based on research of Boris L’vov, makes ET AAS essentially free from interference. The major components of this concept are:

* Atomization of the sample from a graphite platform inserted into the graphite tube (L’vov platform) instead of from the tube wall in order to delay atomization until the gas phase in the atomizer has reached a stable temperature;

* Use of a chemical modifier in order to stabilize the analyte to a pyrolysis temperature that is sufficient to remove the majority of the matrix components;

* Integration of the absorbance over the time of the transient absorption signal instead of using peak height absorbance for quantification.

In ET AAS a transient signal is generated, the area of which is directly proportional to the mass of analyte (not its concentration) introduced into the graphite tube. This technique has the advantage that any kind of sample, solid, liquid or gaseous, can be analyzed directly. Its sensitivity is 2–3 orders of magnitude higher than that of flame AAS, so that determinations in the low μg L-1 range (for a typical sample volume of 20µL) and ng g-1 range (for a typical sample mass of 1 mg) can be carried out. It shows a very high degree of freedom from interferences, so that ET AAS might be considered the most robust technique available nowadays for the determination of trace elements in complex matrices.

=== Radiation sources ===
We have to distinguish between line source AAS (LS AAS) and continuum source AAS (CS AAS). In classical LS AAS, as it has been proposed by Alan Walsh, the high spectral resolution required for AAS measurements is provided by the radiation source itself that emits the spectrum of the analyte in the form of lines that are narrower than the absorption lines. Continuum sources, such as deuterium lamps, are only used for background correction purposes. The advantage of this technique is that only a medium-resolution monochromator is necessary for measuring AAS; however, it has the disadvantage that usually a separate lamp is required for each element that has to be determined. In CS AAS, in contrast, a single lamp, emitting a continuum spectrum over the entire spectral range of interest is used for all elements. Obviously, a high-resolution monochromator is required for this technique, as will be discussed later.

[[File:HKL.jpg|thumb|250px|Hollow cathode lamp (HCL)]]
==== Hollow cathode lamps ====
[[Hollow cathode lamps]] (HCL) are the most common radiation source in LS AAS. Inside the sealed lamp, filled with argon or neon gas at low pressure, is a cylindrical metal cathode containing the element of interest and an anode. A high voltage is applied across the anode and cathode, resulting in an ionization of the fill gas. The gas ions are accelerated towards the cathode and, upon impact on the cathode, sputter cathode material that is excited in the glow discharge to emit the radiation of the sputtered material, i.e., the element of interest.

==== Electrodeless discharge lamps ====
[[Electrodeless lamp|Electrodeless discharge lamps]] (EDL) contain a small quantity of the analyte as a metal or a salt in a quartz bulb together with an inert gas, typically argon, at low pressure. The bulb is inserted into a coil that is generating an electromagnetic radio frequency field, resulting in a low-pressure inductively coupled discharge in the lamp. The emission from an EDL is higher than that from an HCL, and the line width is generally narrower, but EDLs need a separate power supply and might need a longer time to stabilize.

==== Deuterium lamps ====
[[Deuterium arc lamp|Deuterium HCL]] or even hydrogen HCL and deuterium discharge lamps are used in LS AAS for background correction purposes. The radiation intensity emitted by these lamps is decreasing significantly with increasing wavelength, so that they can be only used in the wavelength range between 190 and about 320 nm.

[[File:Continuous radiation source.jpg|thumb|250px|Xenon lamp as a continuous radiation source]]
==== Continuum sources ====
When a continuum radiation source is used for AAS, it is necessary to use a high-resolution monochromator, as will be discussed later. In addition it is necessary that the lamp emits radiation of intensity at least an order of magnitude above that of a typical HCL over the entire wavelength range from 190 nm to 900 nm. A special high-pressure xenon short arc lamp, operating in a hot-spot mode has been developed to fulfill these requirements.

=== Spectrometer ===
As already pointed out above, we have to distinguish between medium-resolution spectrometers that are used for LS AAS and high-resolution spectrometers that are designed for CS AAS. The spectrometer includes the spectral sorting device (monochromator) and the detector.

==== Spectrometers for LS AAS ====
In LS AAS the high resolution that is required for the measurement of atomic absorption is provided by the narrow line emission of the radiation source, and the monochromator simply has to resolve the analytical line from other radiation emitted by the lamp. This can usually be accomplished with a band pass between 0.2 and 2 nm, i.e., a medium-resolution monochromator. Another feature to make LS AAS element-specific is modulation of the primary radiation and the use of a selective amplifier that is tuned to the same modulation frequency, as already postulated by Alan Walsh. This way any (unmodulated) radiation emitted for example by the atomizer can be excluded, which is imperative for LS AAS. Simple monochromators of the Littrow or (better) the Czerny-Turner design are typically used for LS AAS. Photomultiplier tubes are the most frequently used detectors in LS AAS, although solid state detectors might be preferred because of their better [[signal-to-noise ratio]].

==== Spectrometers for CS AAS ====
When a continuum radiation source is used for AAS measurement it is indispensable to work with a high-resolution monochromator. The resolution has to be equal to or better than the half width of an atomic absorption line (about 2 pm) in order to avoid losses of sensitivity and linearity of the calibration graph. The research with high-resolution (HR) CS AAS was pioneered by the groups of O’Haver and Harnly in the USA, who also developed the (up until now) only simultaneous multi-element spectrometer for this technique. The break-through, however, came when the group of Becker-Ross in Berlin, Germany, built a spectrometer entirely designed for HR-CS AAS. The first commercial equipment for HR-CS AAS was introduced by [[Analytik Jena]] (Jena, Germany) at the beginning of the 21st century, based on the design proposed by Becker-Ross and Florek. These spectrometers use a compact double monochromator with a prism pre-monochromator and an echelle grating monochromator for high resolution. A linear charge coupled device (CCD) array with 200 pixels is used as the detector. The second monochromator does not have an exit slit; hence the spectral environment at both sides of the analytical line becomes visible at high resolution. As typically only 3–5 pixels are used to measure the atomic absorption, the other pixels are available for correction purposes. One of these corrections is that for lamp flicker noise, which is independent of wavelength, resulting in measurements with very low noise level; other corrections are those for background absorption, as will be discussed later.

== Background absorption and background correction == 
The relatively small number of atomic absorption lines (compared to atomic emission lines) and their narrow width (a few pm) make spectral overlap rare; there are only very few examples known that an absorption line from one element will overlap with another. Molecular absorption, in contrast, is much broader, so that it is more likely that some molecular absorption band will overlap with an atomic line. This kind of absorption might be caused by un-dissociated molecules of concomitant elements of the sample or by flame gases. We have to distinguish between the spectra of di-atomic molecules, which exhibit a pronounced fine structure, and those of larger (usually tri-atomic) molecules that don’t show such fine structure. Another source of background absorption, particularly in ET AAS, is scattering of the primary radiation at particles that are generated in the atomization stage, when the matrix could not be removed sufficiently in the pyrolysis stage.

All these phenomena, molecular absorption and radiation scattering, can result in artificially high absorption and an improperly high (erroneous) calculation for the concentration or mass of the analyte in the sample. There are several techniques available to correct for background absorption, and they are significantly different for LS AAS and HR-CS AAS.

=== Background correction techniques in LS AAS ===
In LS AAS background absorption can only be corrected using instrumental techniques, and all of them are based on two sequential measurements, firstly, total absorption (atomic plus background), secondly, background absorption only, and the difference of the two measurements gives the net atomic absorption. Because of this, and because of the use of additional devices in the spectrometer, the signal-to-noise ratio of background-corrected signals is always significantly inferior compared to uncorrected signals. It should also be pointed out that in LS AAS there is no way to correct for (the rare case of) a direct overlap of two atomic lines. In essence there are three techniques used for background correction in LS AAS:

==== Deuterium background correction ====
This is the oldest and still most commonly used technique, particularly for flame AAS. In this case, a separate source (a deuterium lamp) with broad emission is used to measure the background absorption over the entire width of the exit slit of the spectrometer. The use of a separate lamp makes this technique the least accurate one, as it cannot correct for any structured background. It also cannot be used at wavelengths above about 320 nm, as the emission intensity of the deuterium lamp becomes very weak. The use of deuterium HCL is preferable compared to an arc lamp due to the better fit of the image of the former lamp with that of the analyte HCL.

==== Smith-Hieftje background correction ====
This technique (named after their inventors) is based on the line-broadening and self-reversal of emission lines from HCL when high current is applied. Total absorption is measured with normal lamp current, i.e., with a narrow emission line, and background absorption after application of a high-current pulse with the profile of the self-reversed line, which has little emission at the original wavelength, but strong emission on both sides of the analytical line. The advantage of this technique is that only one radiation source is used; among the disadvantages are that the high-current pulses reduce lamp lifetime, and that the technique can only be used for relatively volatile elements, as only those exhibit sufficient self-reversal to avoid dramatic loss of sensitivity. Another problem is that background is not measured at the same wavelength as total absorption, making the technique unsuitable for correcting structured background.

==== Zeeman-effect background correction ====
An alternating magnetic field is applied at the atomizer (graphite furnace) to split the absorption line into three components, the π component, which remains at the same position as the original absorption line, and two σ components, which are moved to higher and lower wavelengths, respectively (see [[Zeeman Effect]]). Total absorption is measured without magnetic field and background absorption with the magnetic field on. The π component has to be removed in this case, e.g. using a polarizer, and the σ components do not overlap with the emission profile of the lamp, so that only the background absorption is measured. The advantage of this technique is that total and background absorption are measured with the same emission profile of the same lamp, so that any kind of background, including background with fine structure can be corrected accurately, unless the molecule responsible for the background is also affected by the magnetic field; the disadvantage is the increased complexity of the spectrometer.

=== Background correction techniques in HR-CS AAS ===
In HR-CS AAS background correction is carried out mathematically in the software using information from detector pixels that are not used for measuring atomic absorption; hence, in contrast to LS AAS, no additional components are required for background correction.

==== Background correction using correction pixels ====
It has already been mentioned that in HR-CS AAS lamp flicker noise is eliminated using correction pixels. In fact, any increase or decrease in radiation intensity that is observed to the same extent at all pixels chosen for correction is eliminated by the correction algorithm. This obviously also includes a reduction of the measured intensity due to radiation scattering or molecular absorption, which is corrected in the same way. As measurement of total and background absorption, and correction for the latter, are strictly simultaneous (in contrast to LS AAS), even the fastest changes of background absorption, as they may be observed in ET AAS, do not cause any problem. In addition, as the same algorithm is used for background correction and elimination of lamp noise, the background corrected signals show a much better signal-to-noise ratio compared to the uncorrected signals, which is also in contrast to LS AAS.

==== Background correction using a least-squares algorithm ====
The above technique can obviously not correct for a background with fine structure, as in this case the absorbance will be different at each of the correction pixels. In this case HR-CS AAS is offering the possibility to measure correction spectra of the molecule(s) that is (are) responsible for the background and store them in the computer. These spectra are then multiplied with a factor to match the intensity of the sample spectrum and subtracted pixel by pixel and spectrum by spectrum from the sample spectrum using a least-squares algorithm. This might sound complex, but first of all the number of di-atomic molecules that can exist at the temperatures of the atomizers used in AAS is relatively small, and second, the correction is performed by the computer within a few seconds. The same algorithm can actually also be used to correct for direct line overlap of two atomic absorption lines, making HR-CS AAS the only AAS technique that can correct for this kind of spectral interference.

'''Arthur St. Clair''' ({{OldStyleDateDY|March 23,|1737&lt;ref name=&quot;ANB&quot; /&gt;|1736&lt;!--OS New Year began March 25--&gt;}}– August 31, 1818) was an American soldier and politician. Born in Scotland, he served in the [[British Army]] during the [[French and Indian War]] before settling in [[Pennsylvania]], where he held local office. During the [[American Revolutionary War]], he rose to the rank of major general in the [[Continental Army]], but lost his command after a controversial retreat.

After the war, he was elected to the [[Congress of the Confederation|Confederation Congress]], where he served a term as [[President of the Continental Congress|president]] and was appointed governor of the [[Northwest Territory]]. Disputes with Native Americans over land treaties resulted in the [[Northwest Indian War]]. In 1791, General St. Clair led an expedition against the natives that resulted in the [[Battle of the Wabash|worst defeat]] the United States Army would ever suffer at the hands of Native Americans. Although an investigation exonerated him, St. Clair resigned his army commission. He continued to serve as territorial governor until 1802, when he retired to Pennsylvania. Although once very wealthy, he died in poverty.

==Early life and career==
St. Clair was born in [[Thurso]], [[Caithness]], [[Scotland]]. Little is known of his early life. Early biographers estimated his year of birth as 1734,&lt;ref&gt;Smith, ''St. Clair Papers'', 1:2.&lt;/ref&gt; but subsequent historians uncovered a birth date of March 23, 1736, which in the [[Old Style and New Style dates|modern calendar system]] means that he was born in 1737. &lt;!-- I don't know if the March 23 part is Julian or Gregorian. --&gt; His parents, unknown to early biographers, were probably William Sinclair, a merchant, and Elizabeth Balfour.&lt;ref name=&quot;ANB&quot;&gt;Gregory Evans Dowd. &quot;St. Clair, Arthur&quot;, ''[[American National Biography Online]]'', February 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; He reportedly attended the [[University of Edinburgh]] before being apprenticed to the renowned physician [[William Hunter (anatomist)|William Hunter]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ANB&quot; /&gt;

==Seven Years War==
{{Further|[[Great Britain in the Seven Years War]]}}
In 1757, St. Clair purchased a commission in the [[British Army]], [[Royal American Regiment]], and came to America with Admiral [[Edward Boscawen]]'s fleet for the [[French and Indian War]]. He served under General [[Jeffrey Amherst]] at the capture of [[Fortress Louisbourg|Louisburg, Nova Scotia]] on July 26, 1758. On April 17, 1759, he received a lieutenant's commission and was assigned to the command of General [[James Wolfe]], under whom he served at the [[Battle of the Plains of Abraham]]. St. Clair met young lady Phoebe Bayard, a member of one of the most prominent families in Boston and they married in 1760.  Miss Bayard's mother's maiden name was Bowdoin and sister to James Bowdoin, colonial governor of Massachusetts.

==Settler in America==
On April 16, 1762, he resigned his commission, and, in 1764, he settled in [[Ligonier Valley, Pennsylvania]], where he purchased land and erected mills. He was the largest landowner in [[Western Pennsylvania]].

In 1770, St. Clair became a justice of the court, of quarter sessions and of common pleas, a member of the proprietary council, a justice, recorder, and clerk of the orphans' court, and [[prothonotary]] of [[Bedford County, Pennsylvania|Bedford]] and [[Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania|Westmoreland]] counties.

In 1774, the [[colony of Virginia]] took claim of the area around [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]], and some residents of Western Pennsylvania took up arms to eject them.  St. Clair issued an order for the arrest of the officer leading the Virginia troops. [[Lord Dunmore's War]] eventually settled the boundary dispute.

==Revolutionary War==
By the mid-1770s, St. Clair considered himself more of an American than a British subject. In January 1776, he accepted a commission in the [[Continental Army]] as a [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]] of the [[3rd Pennsylvania Regiment]]. He first saw service in the later days of the [[Invasion of Canada (1775)|Quebec invasion]], where he saw action in the [[Battle of Trois-Rivières]]. He was appointed a [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]] in August 1776, and was sent by Gen. [[George Washington]] to help organize the [[New Jersey]] militia. He took part in [[Washington's crossing of the Delaware River]] on Christmas night 1776, before the [[Battle of Trenton]]. Many biographers credit St. Clair with the strategy which led to Washington's capture of [[Princeton, New Jersey]] in the following days. It was shortly after this that St. Clair was promoted to Major General.

In April 1777, St. Clair was sent to defend [[Fort Ticonderoga]]. His small garrison could not resist British Gen. [[John Burgoyne]]'s larger force in the [[Saratoga Campaign]]. St. Clair was forced to retreat at the [[Siege of Fort Ticonderoga (1777)|Siege of Fort Ticonderoga]] on July 5, 1777. He withdrew his forces and played no further part in the campaign. In 1778 he was [[court-martial]]ed for the loss of Ticonderoga. The court exonerated him and he returned to duty, although he was no longer given any battlefield commands. He still saw action, however, as an [[aide-de-camp]] to General Washington, who retained a high opinion of him. St. Clair was at [[siege of Yorktown|Yorktown]] when [[Charles Cornwallis|Lord Cornwallis]] surrendered his army.

==President of Congress==
St. Clair was a member of the Pennsylvania Council of Censors in 1783, and was elected a delegate to the [[Congress of the Confederation|Confederation Congress]], serving from November 2, 1785, until November 28, 1787. Chaos ruled the day in early 1787 with [[Shays' Rebellion]] in full force and the states refusing to settle land disputes or contribute to the now six year-old federal government. On February 2, 1787, the delegates finally gathered into a quorum and elected St. Clair to a one-year term as [[President of the Continental Congress|president of Congress]]. Congress enacted its most important piece of legislation, the [[Northwest Ordinance]], during St. Clair's tenure as president. Time was running out for the Confederation Congress, however: during St. Clair's presidency, the [[Philadelphia Convention]] was drafting a new [[United States Constitution]], which would abolish the old Congress.

==Northwest Territory==
Under the [[Northwest Ordinance]] of 1787, which created the [[Northwest Territory]], General St. Clair was appointed governor of what is now [[Ohio]], [[Indiana]], [[Illinois]], [[Michigan]], along with parts of [[Wisconsin]] and [[Minnesota]]. He named [[Cincinnati, Ohio]], after the [[Society of the Cincinnati]], and it was there that he established his home. When the territory was divided in 1800, he served as governor of the [[Ohio Territory]]. 

As Governor, he formulated [[Maxwell's Code]] (named after its printer, [[William Maxwell (engraver)|William Maxwell]]), the first written laws of the territory.  He also sought to end Native American claims to Ohio land and clear the way for white settlement. In 1789, he succeeded in getting certain Indians to sign the [[Treaty of Fort Harmar]], but many native leaders had not been invited to participate in the negotiations, or had refused to do so.  Rather than settling the Indian's claims, the treaty provoked them to further resistance in what is sometimes known as the &quot;[[Northwest Indian War]]&quot; (or &quot;Little Turtle's War&quot;). Mutual hostilities led to a campaign by General [[Josiah Harmar]], whose 1,500 militiamen were defeated by the Indians in October 1790.

In 1791, St. Clair succeeded Harmar as the senior general of the [[United States Army]]. He personally led a [[punitive expedition]] involving two Regular Army regiments and some militia. This force advanced to the location of Indian settlements near the headwaters of the [[Wabash River]], but on November 4 they were routed in battle by a tribal confederation led by [[Miami tribe|Miami]] Chief [[Little Turtle]] and Shawnee chief [[Blue Jacket]]. More than 600 soldiers and scores of women and children were killed in the battle, which has since borne the name &quot;[[St. Clair's Defeat]], also known as the &quot;[[Battle of the Wabash]]&quot;, the &quot;Columbia Massacre,&quot; or the &quot;Battle of a Thousand Slain&quot;. It remains the greatest defeat of an US army by Native Americans in history, with some 623 American soldiers killed in action, contrasted with about 50 Native American dead. After this debacle, St. Clair resigned from the army at the request of [[President of the United States|President]] Washington, but continued to serve as Governor of the Northwest Territory. 

A [[United States Federalist Party|Federalist]], St. Clair hoped to see two states made of the Ohio Territory in order to increase Federalist power in [[United States Congress|Congress]]. However, he was resented by Ohio Democratic-Republicans for what were perceived as his partisanship, high-handededness and arrogance in office.  In 1802, his opposition to plans for Ohio statehood led President [[Thomas Jefferson]] to remove him from office as territorial governor.  He thus played no part in the organizing of the state of [[Ohio]] in 1803.  The first [[Ohio Constitution]] provided for a weak governor and a strong [[legislature]], in part due to a reaction to St. Clair's method of governance.

==Death and legacy==
Arthur St. Clair, Patriot and a Founder of the United States of America, died in [[Greensburg, Pennsylvania]] on August 31, 1818 in his eighties and in poverty; his vast wealth dissipated by generous gifts and loans, and by business reverses, but, mainly by the refusal of Congress to reimburse him for monies that he had loaned during the Revolution and while governor of the Northwest Territory. He lived with his daughter Louisa St. Clair Robb and her family on the ridge between Ligonier and Greensburg.  St. Clair's remains are buried under a Masonic monument in St. Clair Park in downtown [[Greensburg, Pennsylvania|Greensburg]]. His wife Phoebe died shortly after and is buried beside him.

A portion of The Hermitage, St. Clair's home in [[Youngstown, Pennsylvania]] was later moved to [[Ligonier, Pennsylvania]], where it is now preserved, along with St. Clair artifacts and memorabilia at the Fort Ligonier Museum. 

An [[American Civil War]] steamer was named [[USS St. Clair (1862)|USS St. Clair]].

'''Ajaccio''' ({{Lang-la|Adiacium}}; {{Lang-fr|Ajaccio}}, {{IPA-fr|aʒaksjo|}}; {{Lang-co|Aiacciu}} {{IPA-itdia|aˈjattʃu|}}; {{Lang-it|Ajaccio}}, {{IPA-it|aˈjattʃo|}}), is a [[Communes of France|commune]] on the island of [[Corsica]] in France. It is the capital and largest city of the region of [[Corsica]] and the [[Prefectures in France|prefecture]] of the [[Departments of France|department]] of [[Corse-du-Sud]].

The geopolitical arrangements of the commune are slightly different from those typical of Corsica and France. Usually an arrondissement includes cantons and a canton includes one to several communes including the chef-lieu, &quot;chief place&quot;, from which the canton takes its name. The city of Ajaccio is one commune, but it contains six cantons, Cantons 1–6, and a fraction of Canton 7. The latter contains five other communes: [[Bastelicaccia]], [[Alata, Corse-du-Sud|Alata]], [[Afa, Corse-du-Sud|Afa]], [[Appietto]] and [[Villanova, Corse-du-Sud|Villanova]], making a total of six communes for the seven cantons of Ajaccio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=France, le trésor des régions: Département: Corse-du-Sud|url=http://tresordesregions.mgm.fr/Mdir.php?p=cant.php&amp;region=94&amp;cl=|accessdate=6 May 2008}} {{Language icon|fr}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Each canton contains a certain number of quartiers, &quot;quarters&quot;. Cantons 1, 2, 3, 6, 7 are located along the Gulf of Ajaccio from west to east, while 4 and 5 are a little further up the valleys of the Gravona and the Prunelli Rivers. These political divisions subdivide the population of Ajaccio into units that can be more democratically served but they do not give a true picture of the size of Ajaccio. In general language, &quot;greater Ajaccio&quot; includes about 100,000 people with all the medical, educational, utility and transportational facilities of a big city. Up until World War II it was still possible to regard the city as being a settlement of narrow streets localized to some part of the harbor or the Gulf of Ajaccio; such bucolic descriptions do not fit the city of today, and travellogues intended for mountain or coastal recreational areas do not generally apply to Corsica's few big cities.

The arrondissement contains other cantons that extend generally up the two rivers into central Corsica.

==Geography==
Ajaccio is located on the west coast of the island of Corsica, {{convert|210|nmi|km|-1}} southeast of [[Marseille]]. It occupies a sheltered position at the foot of wooded hills on the northern shore of the [[Gulf of Ajaccio]]. The harbour lies to the east of the foundation site at the original citadel on a hill overlooking a peninsula protecting the [http://viewthathome.co.uk/Documents/AJACCIO_FROM_SHIP.htm harbor on the south], where now are located the Quai de la Citadelle and the Jettée de la Citadelle. The modern city not only encloses the entire harbor but takes up the better part of the Gulf of Ajaccio and in suburban form extends for some miles up the valley of the [[Gravona River]]. The flow from that river is nearly entirely consumed as the city's water supply.

==History==
===Earliest literary evidence===
The earliest record of a settlement at Ajaccio having a name ancestral to its name is the exhortation in Epistle 77 written in 601 CE of [[Gregory the great]] to the Defensor Boniface, one of two known rectors of the early Corsican church,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages=318|title=The Popes and the Papacy in the Early Middle Ages, 476–752|first=Jeffrey|last=Richards|year=1979|isbn=0-7100-0098-7|publisher=Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; not to leave [[Aleria]] and Adjacium without bishops.&lt;ref&gt;See below under Bibliography.&lt;/ref&gt; There is no earlier use of the term and Adjacium is not an attested [[Latin language|Latin]] word, which probably means that it is a Latinization of a word in some other language. The [[Ravenna Cosmography]] of about 700 CE cites Agiation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ravennatis Anonymi Cosmographia et Guidonis Geographica|pages=413|author=Anonymous of Ravenna|coauthors=Guido; Gustav Parthey; Moritz Pinder|year=1860|location=Berolini|publisher=in aedibvs Friderici
Nicolai}} {{Language icon|la}}. Downloadable Google Books.&lt;/ref&gt; which sometimes is taken as evidence of a prior Greek city, as -ion appears to be a Greek ending. But, there is no evidence whatever of a Greek presence on the west coast and the [[Ionians]] at [[Aleria]] on the east coast had been expelled by the Etruscans long before Roman domination.&lt;ref&gt;Manuscript variants are Agration and Agiagium nor does the use of a Greek ending indicate anything at all about ethnicity at this late date geographers used either Greek or Latin forms at will. The word is no more decipherable in Greek than it is in Latin; attempts to connect two or three letters with [[Indo-European language|Indo-European]] roots amount to wild speculation. Moreover, the mythological connection to [[Ajax (mythology)|Ajax]] is pure folk-etymology; that a legendary character of 1600 years before the first instance of the name should have been real and should have left his name on a Corsican city hundreds of years before any existed there is unlikely.&lt;/ref&gt; The original name remains unknown, perhaps never will be known and therefore is likely to have been aboriginal.

[[Ptolemy]], who must come the closest to representing indigenous names, lists the Lochra River just south of a feature he calls the &quot;sandy shore&quot; on the southwest coast. If the shore is the Campo dell'Oro (gold because of the sand?) the Lochra would seem to be the combined mouth of the Gravona and Prunelli Rivers, neither one of which sounds like Lochra.

North of there is a Roman city, Ourchinion. His western coastline is so distorted, however, that it is impossible to say where Adjacium was; certainly, he would have known its name and location if he had had any first-hand knowledge of the island and if in fact it was there. Ptolemy's Ourchinion is further north than Ajaccio and does not have the same name. It could be Sogone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Pierre|last=Massimi|coauthors=Jose Tomazi|title=A corsica in la carta geografica di Ptolomey|work=InterRomania|publisher=Centru Culturale, Universita di Corsica|year=2002|format=pdf|accessdate=18 May 2008|url=http://www.interromania.com/media/pdf/benigni/ptolomeu.pdf}} {{Language icon|co}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of correspondence between Ptolemaic and historical names known to be ancient has no defense except in the case of the two Roman colonies, Aleria and Mariana. In any case the population of the region must belong to Ptolemy's Tarabeni or Titiani people, neither of which are ever heard about again.

===Archaeological evidence===
The population of the city throughout the centuries maintained an oral tradition that had originally been Roman. Nineteenth-century travellers could point to the Hill of San Giovanni on the northwest shore of the Gulf of Ajaccio, which still had a cathedral said to have been the 6th century seat of the Bishop of Ajaccio. The Castello Vecchio (&quot;old castle&quot;), a ruined citadel, was believed to be Roman but turned out to have Gothic features. The hill was planted with vines. The farmers kept turning up artifacts and terracotta funerary urns that seemed to be Roman.

In the 20th century the hill was covered over with buildings and became a part of downtown Ajaccio. In 2005 construction plans for a lot on the hill offered the opportunity to the Institut national de recherches archéologiques preventatives (Inrap) to excavate. They found the baptistry of the 6th century cathedral and large amounts of pottery dated to the 6th and 7th centuries AD; in other words, the early Christian town. A cemetery had been placed over the old church. In it was a single Roman grave covered over with roof tiles bearing short indecipherable inscriptions. The finds of the previous century had included Roman coins. This is the only evidence so far of a Roman city continuous with the early Christian one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Discovery of an Early Christian Baptistery in Ajaccio|url=http://www.inrap.fr/preventive-archaeology/In_the_News/Press_release/p-1346-Discovery_of_an_Early_Christian_Baptistery_in_Ajac.htm|publisher=Inrap|date=9 June 2005|accessdate=9 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genoese foundation===
{{details|History of Corsica#Renaissance}}
The present town of Ajaccio was founded in 1492 {{convert|3|km|0}} south of the Christian village by the [[Bank of Saint George]] at [[Genoa]], which dispatched Cristoforo of Gandini, an architect, to build it. He began with a castle on Capo di Bolo, around which he constructed residences for several hundred people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the city of Ajaccio|url=http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=fr&amp;u=http://www.ajaccio.fr/Histoire-de-la-ville-d-Ajaccio_a12.html&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=translate&amp;resnum=4&amp;ct=result&amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3Dadjacium%26hl%3Den%26lr%3D%26as_qdr%3Dall%26pwst%3D1|accessdate=16 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new city was essentially a colony of Genoa. The Corsicans were restricted from the city for some years, even though they had requested the services of the bank as peace-keeper and problem-solver.

===From origin to annexation===
The [[Republic of Genoa]] was strong enough to keep Corsica until 1755, the year [[Pasquale Paoli]] proclaimed the [[Corsican Republic]]. Paoli took most of the island for the republic but he was unable to force Genoese troops out of the citadels of [[Saint-Florent, Haute-Corse|Saint-Florent]], [[Calvi, Haute-Corse|Calvi]], Ajaccio, [[Bastia]] and [[Algajola]]. Leaving them there, he went on build the nation, while the Republic of Genoa was left to ponder prospects and solutions. Their ultimate solution was to sell Corsica to France and French troops of the [[ancien régime]] replaced Genoese ones in the citadels, including Ajaccio's. Corsica was annexed to France in 1780.

===Napoleon I===
Ostensibly [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] (Nabulione Buonaparte) was born at Ajaccio in the same year as the [[Battle of Ponte Novu]], 1769. The Bonapartes at the time had a modest four-story home in town (now a museum known as [[Casa Buonaparte]]) and a rarely used country home in the hills north of the city (now site of the [[Arboretum des Milelli]]). The father of the family, attorney Charles-Marie Buonaparte, was secretary to Pasquali Paoli during the golden years of the republic.

After the defeat of Paoli the Comte de Marbeuf began to meet with some leading Corsicans to outline the shape of the future and enlist their assistance. Charles was among a delegation from Ajaccio in 1769, offered his loyalty and was appointed assessor.

Marbeuf also offered Charles-Marie one appointment for one of his sons to the [[Brienne-le-Château|Military College of Brienne]], but the child must be under 10. There is a dispute concerning Napoleon's age because of this requirement; the emperor is known to have altered the civic records at Ajaccio concerning himself and it is possible that he was born in [[Corte]] in 1768 when his father was there on business. In any case Napoleon went to Brienne 1779–1784.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages=Chapter 1|title=The Life of Napoleon Bonaparte|first=Sabine|last=Baring-Gould|year=2006|publisher=Adamant Media Corporation|isbn=0-543-95815-9|nopp=true}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At Brienne Napoleon concentrated on studies. He wrote a boyish history of Corsica. He did not share his father's views but held Pasquale Paoli in high esteem and was at heart a Corsican nationalist. The top students were encouraged to go into the artillery. After graduation and a brief sojourn at the Military School of Paris Napoleon applied for second-lieutenancy in the artillery regiment of La Fère at Valence and after a time was given the position. Meanwhile his father died and his mother was cast into poverty in Corsica, still having four children to support. Her only income was Napoleon's meagre salary.

The regiment was in [[Auxonne]] when the revolution broke out in the summer of 1789. Napoleon returned on leave to Ajaccio in October, became a [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobin]] and began to work for the revolution. The National Assembly in Paris united Corsica to France and pardoned its exiles. Paoli returning in 1790 after 21 years kissed the soil on which he stood. He and Napoleon met and toured the battlefield of Paoli's defeat. A national assembly at Orezza created the department of Corsica and Paoli was subsequently elected president. He commanded the national guard raised by Napoleon. After a brief return to his regiment Napoleon was promoted to First Lieutenant and came home again on leave in 1791. The death of a rich uncle relieved the family's poverty.

All officers were recalled from leave in 1792, intervention threatened and war with Austria ([[Marie-Antoinette]]'s homeland) began. Napoleon returned to Paris for review, was exonerated, promoted to Captain and given leave to escort his sister, a schoolgirl, back to Corsica at state expense. His family was prospering; the estate increased.

Napoleon became a Lieutenant-Colonel in the Corsican National Guard. Paoli sent him off on an expedition to [[Sardinia]] ordered by France under Paolis's nephew, but the nephew had secret orders from Paoli to make sure the expedition failed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=La Maddalena, 22/25&amp;nbsp;February 1793|first=Maurizio|last=Cinti|work=Military Subjects: Battles &amp; Campaigns|publisher=The Napoleon Series|date=1995-20-04|url=http://www.napoleon-series.org/military/battles/c_maddalena.html|accessdate=25 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The leader was now a conservative, had opposed the execution of the king and supported alliance with England. Returning from Sardinia Napoleon with his family and all his supporters were instrumental in getting Paoli denounced at the National Convention in Paris in 1793. Napoleon earned the hatred of the Paolists by pretending to support Paoli and then turning against him (payment, one supposes, for Sardinia).

Paoli was convicted in absentia, a warrant was sent for his arrest (which could not be served) and Napoleon was dispatched to Corsica as Inspector-general of Artillery to take the citadel of Ajaccio from the royalists, who had held it since 1789. The Paolists combining with the royalists defeated the French in two pitched battles and Napoleon and his family went on the run, hiding by day, while the Paolists burned their estate. Napoleon and his mother, Laetitia, were taken out by ship in June 1793, by friends while two of the girls found refuge with other friends. They landed in [[Toulon]] with only Napoleon's pay for their support.

The Bonapartes moved to [[Marseille]] but in August Toulon offered itself to the British and received the protection of a fleet under [[Samuel Hood, 1st Viscount Hood|Admiral Hood]]. The [[Siege of Toulon]] began in September under revolutionary officers mainly untrained in the art of war. Napoleon happened to present socially one evening and during a casual conversation over a misplaced 24-pounder explained the value of artillery. Taken seriously he was allowed to bring up over 100 guns from coastal emplacements but his plan for the taking of Toulon was set aside as one incompetent officer superseded another. By December they decided to try his plan and made him a Colonel. Placing the guns at close range he used them to keep off the British fleet while he battered down the walls of Toulon. As soon as the [[Committee of Public Safety]] heard of the victory Napoleon became a Brigadier General, the start of his meteoric rise to power.

The Bonapartes were back in Ajaccio in 1797 under the protection of general Napoleon. Shortly after Napoleon became First Consul and then emperor, using the office to spread the revolution throughout Europe. In 1811 he made Ajaccio the capital of the new Department of Corsica. Despite his subsequent defeat by the Prussians, Russians and British allies, exile and death, no victorious power has reversed that decision or tried to remove Corsica from France. Among the natives, though Corsican nationalism is strong, and feeling often runs high in favor of a union with [[Italy]], loyalty to France, as evidenced by elections, remains stronger.

Major population growth within Ajaccio occurred between 1945 and 1975, with a doubling of the city's population, caused by a general shift of the population away from rural areas. From the 1960s, ''[[pieds-noir]]s'' (French citizens living in the north African colonies), immigrants chiefly from the [[Mahgreb]], and continental French people also contributed to the increase.

==Transport==
Ajaccio is served primarily by [[Campo dell'Oro Airport]] on the east side of the Gulf of Ajaccio just north of the mouth of the [[Gravona River]]. From there Route N193 readily connects to the center of the city. Ferries also leave regularly from Quai L'Herminier on the west side of the gulf for [[Porto Torres]], [[Marseille]], [[Toulon]] and [[Nice]]. A major road, Route N194, travels up the valley of the Gravona River leading to [[Corte]] and is paralleled by a scenic narrow-gauge railway. Another major road, Route N196, winds southeast to [[Bonifacio, Corse-du-Sud|Bonifacio]].

=== Local buses ===
The local public transport organisation, ''Transports en Commun d'Ajaccio'' (Ajaccio public transport) provides 8 urban routes, 4 &quot;citadines&quot; &lt;!-- no idea what this means --&gt; routes, and 9 longer distance routes. The 8 main lines are:

* Line 1 : Les Crêtes – Vazzio/Ricanto-Capitello
* Line 2 : Les Crêtes – Confina
* Line 3 : Place De Gaulle – Pietralba
* Line 4 : Miséricorde Hospital – Budiccione
* Line 5 : Place de Gaulle – Tennis Parata
* Line 6 : SNCF Station – Castelluccio/Cimetière Saint Antoine
* Line 7 : Empereur – Loretto
* Line 8 : Bus depot – Aéroport Campo dell'Oro

A 300 place carpark is planned at ''Mezzana'' in the nearby commune of [[Sarrola Carcopino]] to encourage combined car-bus use.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ca-ajaccien.fr&lt;/ref&gt;

The introduction of a tramway or [[tram-train]] has also been proposed between Mezzana station in the outer suburbs and the main train station. The use of ferries is also being considered.

=== Railways ===
[[Gare d'Ajaccio]], owned by [[Chemins de fer de Corse]] (Corsica Railways), is located near the port and connects [[Corte]], [[Bastia]] and [[Calvi, Haute-Corse|Calvi]] (with transfer).

There are two optional stops:
*[[Gare des Salines]], at the north of the city, in the district of the same name.
*[[Gare de Campo dell'Oro]], near [[Ajaccio Airport]].

==Administration==
Ajaccio has held several administrative roles over the years:
* ''[[chef-lieu]]'' (chief town or capital) of the department of Corsica, from 1790 to 1793;
* ''chef-lieu'' of the department of [[Liamone]]from 1793 to 1811;
* ''chef-lieu'' of the department of Corsica, from 1811 to 1975;
* ''chef-lieu'' of the region, then of the territorial commonwealth of Corsica, from 1970, and finally of the department of Corse-du-Sud (South Corsica), from 1976.

===Inter-town links===
Since December 2001, Ajaccio has been part of the [[Communauté d'agglomération du Pays Ajaccien|Communauté d'Agglomération du Pays Ajaccien (CAPA)]] with nine other communes: ([[Afa, Corse-du-Sud|Afa]], [[Alata, Corse-du-Sud|Alata]], [[Appietto]], [[Cuttoli Corticchiato]], [[Peri, Corse-du-Sud|Peri]], [[Sarrola Carcopino]], [[Tavaco]], [[Valle di Mezzana]] and [[Villanova, Corse-du-Sud|Villanova]].

==Ecclesiastical status==
* The town is the seat of a bishopric dating at least from the seventh century. It has tribunals of first instance and of commerce, training colleges, a communal college, a museum and a library; the three latter are established in the Palais Fesch, founded by [[Cardinal Fesch]], who was born at Ajaccio in 1763.

==Sport==
* The local football club is [[AC Ajaccio]] &amp; GFCO Ajaccio.

'''Ajaigarh''', or '''Adjygurh''' ({{lang-hi|अजैगढ}}) is town and a [[nagar panchayat]] in the [[Panna District]] of [[Madhya Pradesh]] state in central [[India]].

==History==
[[Image:Drapeau Ajaigarh.png|thumb|left|Flag of Ajaigarh.]]Ajaigarh was the capital of a [[princely state]] of the same name during the [[British Raj]]. Ajaigarh was founded in 1765 by Guman Singh, a [[Bundela]] [[Rajput]] who was the nephew of [[Raja Pahar Singh]] of [[Jaitpur]]. After Ajaigarh was captured by the British in 1809, it became a princely state in the [[Bundelkhand]] Agency of the [[Central India Agency]]. It had an area of 771&amp;nbsp;mile² (1997&amp;nbsp;km²), and a population of 78,236 in 1901. The rulers bore the title of ''sawai maharaja''. He commanded an estimated annual revenue of about £15,000/-, and paid a tribute of £460/-.  The chief resided at the town of [[Nowgong]], at the foot of the hill-fortress of Ajaigarh, from which the state took its name. This fort, situated on a steep hill, towers more than 800&amp;nbsp;ft (244 m) above the eponymous township, and contains the ruins of several temples adorned with elaborately carved sculptures. The town was often afflicted by [[malaria]], and suffered severely from famine in 1868-1869 and 1896-1897.

The state acceded to the [[Government of India]] on January 1, 1950; the ruling chief was granted a privy purse of Rs. 74,700/-, and the courtesy use of his styles and titles. All of these were revoked by the government of [[India]] in 1971, at the time when these privileges were revoked from all erstwhile princes. The former princely state became part of the new Indian state of [[Vindhya Pradesh]], and most of the territory of the former state, including the town of Ajaigarh, became part of Panna District, with a smaller portion going to [[Chhatarpur District]]. Vindhya Pradesh was merged into [[Madhya Pradesh]] on November 1, 1956.

==Demographics==
As of 2001 India [[census]],&lt;ref&gt;{{GR|India}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ajaigarh had a population of 13,979. Males constitute 53% of the population and females 47%. Ajaigarh has an average literacy rate of 59%, lower than the national average of 59.5%; with 61% of the males and 39% of females literate. 16% of the population is under 6 years of age.

The '''Ajanta Caves''' (Ajiṇṭhā leni; [[Marathi language|Marathi]]: अजिंठा लेणी), [[Maharashtra]], [[India]] are 29 [[Rock cut architecture|rock-cut]] cave monuments which date from the 2nd century [[Common Era|BCE]]. The caves include paintings and sculptures considered to be masterpieces of both Buddhist religious art (which depict the [[Jataka]] tales)&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/242   ''Ajanta Caves, India: Brief Description,'' UNESCO World Heritage Site. Retrieved 27 October 2006.]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[fresco]]s which are reminiscent of the [[Sigiriya]] paintings in [[Sri Lanka]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | title = UNESCO page - Ancient City of Sigiriya | publisher = UNESCO.org | url = http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/202 | accessdate = 2010-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The caves were built in two phases starting around 200 [[Common Era|BCE]], with the second group of caves built around 600 [[Common era|CE]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/archive/advisory_body_evaluation/242.pdf ''Ajanta Caves: Advisory Body Evaluation,'' UNESCO International Council on Monuments and Sites. 1982.  Retrieved 27 October 2006.], p.2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1983, the Ajanta Caves have been a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]. The caves are located in the Indian state of Maharashtra, near Jalgaon, just outside the village of {{IAST|Ajinṭhā}}({{Coord|20|31|56|N|75|44|44|E|format=dms|type:city|display=inline}}). Caves are only about 59 kilometers from [[Jalgaon]] Railway station (on Delhi - Mumbai, Rail line of the Central railways, India); and 104 kilometers from Aurangabad (From Ellora Caves 100 Kilometers).

==First period==
The first sanctuaries (known as ''[[Chaitya|chaytia-grihas]]'') were built during the [[Satavahana dynasty]] in the canyons of the Waghora River.  Murals preserved from this time belong to India

==Second period==
[[Image:AjantaWik.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Ajanta Caves, map]]
Scholars disagree about the date of the Ajanta Caves' second period. For a time it was thought that the work was done over a long period from the fourth to the 7th century AD, but recently long-time researcher Walter M. Spink declared that most of the work took place over short time period, from 460 to 480 CE, during the reign of Emperor [[Harishena]] of the [[Vakataka]] dynasty. Some 20 cave temples were simultaneously created, for the most part ''viharas'':  monasteries with a sanctuary in the structure's rear centre. Each of cave temples seem to be patronised by influential authority, numerous best available artists have been involved in the work with fruitful rivalry between the neighbouring construction sites.&lt;ref&gt;Spink, Walther M. &quot;Ajanta: History and Development,&quot; 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Spink, the Ajanta Caves appear to have been abandoned shortly after the fall of Harishena circa 480 CE. Since then, these temples have been abandoned and gradually forgotten. During the intervening centuries, the jungle grew back and the caves were hidden, unvisited and undisturbed.

== Rediscovery by Europeans ==
On 28 April 1819, a British officer for the [[Madras Presidency]],  John Smith, while hunting tiger, accidentally discovered the entrance to one of the cave temples (Cave No. 9) deep within the tangled undergrowth. Exploring that first cave, long since a home to nothing more than birds and bats and a lair for other, larger, animals, Captain Smith wrote his name in pencil on one of the walls. Still faintly visible, it records his name and the date, April 1819.

Shortly after this discovery, the Ajanta Caves became renowned for their exotic setting, impressive architecture, historic artwork, and long-forgotten history.

== Cave One ==
{{double image|right|Ajanta Padmapani.jpg|155|Indischer Maler des 7. Jahrhunderts 001.jpg|167|Painting of [[Padmapani]] and [[Vajrapani]] from Cave No. 1}}
[[Image:Cave 01 porch.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Cave 1]]
The first cave was built on the eastern end of the horse-shoe shaped scarp. According to Spink, it is one of the latest caves to have begun on site and brought to near-completion in the [[Vākāţaka]] phase.{{Clarify|date=May 2010}}  Although there is no epigraphic evidence, it has been proposed that the Vākāţaka king [[Harisena]] may have been the benefactor of this better-preserved cave.  A dominant reason for this is that Harisena was not involved initially in patronizing Ajanta.

This cave has one of the most elaborate carvings on its facade with relief sculptures on entablature and ridges. There are scenes carved from the life of the Buddha as well as a number of decorative motifs.  A two pillared portico, visible in the 19th-century photographs, has since perished. The cave has a front-court with cells fronted by pillared vestibules on either side. These have a high plinth level. The cave has a porch with simple cells on both ends. The absence of pillared vestibules on the ends suggest that the porch was not excavated in the latest phase of Ajanta when pillared vestibules had become a necessity and norm. Most areas of the porch were once covered with murals, of which many fragments remain. There are three doorways: a central doorway and two side doorways.  Two square windows were carved between the doorways to brighten the interiors.

Each wall of the hall inside is nearly {{convert|40|ft|m}} long and {{convert|20|ft|m}} high. Twelve pillars make a square colonnade inside supporting the ceiling, and creating spacious aisles along the walls. There is a shrine carved on the rear wall to house an impressive seated image of the Buddha, his hands being in the ''dharmachakrapravartana [[mudra]].'' There are four cells on each of the left, rear, and the right walls. The walls are covered with paintings in a fair state of preservation. The scenes depicted are mostly didactic, devotional, and ornamental. The themes are from the [[Jataka]] stories (the stories of the Buddha's former existences as [[Bodhisattva]]), the life of the [[Gautama Buddha]], and those of his veneration.

==Cave Two==
[[Image:Aurangabad - Ajanta Caves (55).JPG|thumb|200px|left|Painting, Cave No. 2]][[Image:Indischer Maler des 6. Jahrhunderts 001.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Painting from the Ajanta caves]][[Image:Aurangabad - Ajanta Caves (57).JPG|thumb|200px|right|Ajanta Caves]]
Cave 2, adjacent to Cave 1, is known for the paintings that have been preserved on its walls, ceilings, and pillars. It looks similar to Cave 1 and is in a better state of preservation.

=== The facade===
Cave 2 has a porch quite different from Cave one. Even the facade carvings seem to be different. The cave is supported by robust pillars, ornamented with designs. The size and ground plan have many things in common with the first cave.

=== The porch ===
The front porch consists of cells supported by pillared [[Vestibule (architecture)|vestibules]] on both ends. The cells on the previously &quot;wasted areas&quot; were needed to meet the greater housing requirements in later years. Porch-end cells became a trend in all later Vakataka excavations. The simple single cells on porch-ends were converted into CPVs or were planned to provide more room, symmetry, and beauty.

The paintings on the ceilings and walls of this porch have been widely published. They depict the Jataka tales that are stories of the Buddha's life in former existences as Bodhisattva. The porch's rear wall has a doorway in the center, which allows entrance to the hall. On either side of the door is a square-shaped window to brighten the interior.

=== The hall ===
The hall has four [[colonnade]]s  which are supporting the ceiling and surrounding a square in the center of the hall. Each arm or colonnade of the square is parallel to the respective walls of the hall,  making an aisle in between. The colonnades have rock-beams above and below them. The capitals are carved and painted with various decorative themes that include ornamental, human, animal, vegetative, and semi-divine forms.

=== The paintings ===
[[Paintings]] appear on almost every surface of the cave except for the floor. At various places the art work has become eroded due to decay and human interference. Therefore, many areas of the painted walls, ceilings, and pillars are fragmentary. The painted narratives of the [[Jataka tales]] are depicted only on the walls, which demanded the special attention of the devotee. They are didactic in nature, meant to inform the community about the Buddha's teachings and life through successive births. Their placement on the walls required the devotee to walk through the aisles and 'read' the narratives depicted in various episodes. The narrative episodes are depicted one after another although not in a linear order. Their identification has been a core area of research since the site's rediscovery in 1819. Dieter Schlingloff's identifications have updated our knowledge on the subject.

Some believe that the art work has erroneously been alluded to as &quot;[[fresco]]&quot;, rather than [[mural]], and assert that the technique and process used to produce this kind of artwork is unlike any other artwork found in the art history of other civilizations, including within the history of South Asian art.

==Cave Five,six &amp; Seven==
Cave 5:
The T-shaped porched doorway is the only feature because the scooping did not go beyond it. The exuberant carvings are evident here and the jambs and the lintems seem to be of later century.

Cave 6:
This was the first important cave of the Mahayana phase. The sculptors were probably copying wooden prototypes, or wanted stable supports, so they included one central pillar in their lower story. The simple octagonal pillars are bare, unlike the pillars of other caves, which have capitals and bases. There extensions at the end of the front and the rear aisles to enable pilgrims to circumambulate the Buddha's throne.
There is a Buddha image in the lower cave 6. He is sitting with his feet squat on the base, in a rigid pose, only enlivened by the gestures of his hand and the flying couples above him. There could be circumambulation around the Buddha's shrine. This is a late cave, because, instead of attendant bodhisattavas, there are attendants Buddha.
The porch doorway is simple with not much carved decoration except attached female figures. There is a medallion in this cave in the colonnade of the shrine vestibule. The couple in the medallion is skillfully carved, but the medallion itself is conventional.

Bhikshu with Lotus :
The painting of Bhikshu in this cave in the middle, done about 5th century, is almost like a relief. There is the rhythmic vitality in the line and boldness of drawing. The painting is almost like a sculpture. The folds of the garment, the rounded belly, and the calm on the face suggest a devote worshipper.

CAVE 7:
The verandah of this cave must at one time have been elaborate. The ceiling was obviously painted. The carving is simple.

==Cave Nine,Ten, Eleven ==
[[File:Ajanta cave no. 9 2010.jpg|thumb|200px|Cave 9]]
Cave 9: 
This cave has a Chaitya gathering hall. There are two early paintings, which survive.
Frieze Of Animals And Herdsmen
Naga Worshippers
Giant Horseshoe Window

There is a Giant Horse-Shoe Window on the façade. The carving of this window suggests that it copied a wooden structure of the same time. The pillars and the slanting eight-sided columns are also copied from wooden structures of earlier times.

Cave 10:
This is of about the same time as cave 9. It has a similar shape. The large chaitya gathering hall is 28.5m X 12.3m wide and 11m high. It has a stupa shrine at the ambulating passage around the symbolic stupa.

King With His Retinue:
The paintings in this cave show resemblance with the relief carvings at sanchi in central India of the 2nd century B.C. The painting on the left wall shows the King with his Retinue, worshiping the Buddha tree. The royal party stops at the stupa and then passes through a gateway.
SHAD-DANTA JATAKA:
On the right wall are the series of large wall paintings. One shows the Shada-danta jataka, with the Buddha in his elephant incarnation. This is a crowded scene, but each figure is clearly distinguished from the other. The whole crowd is in movement.
ELEPHANTAS IN JUNGLE:
In one scene are shown Elephantas in the jungle, with a six-tusked elephant, which is supposed to be a previous incarnation of the Buddha. The animals are beautifully drawn and the large space of the forests, with its thick foliage and trees, is contrasted to the houses on the side.
PRINCESS AND TUSK:
In the second scene, the princess, seated on a stool, is shown fainting, because the six tusks of the elephant are brought to the king. The queen has wished that the elephant be killed. Now that his tusks are brought before the court, she faints at sight of them. The drama is manifestly painted.
THE BUDDHISATTVA ON THE PILLAR:
One of the earliest masterpieces of the 1st century BCE. or 1st century CE. has the simplicity, tenderness and grace of the early archaic art of Ajanta. The gracious figure in the pink and buff cloak surrounded by green aureole is emerging to cast blessings on mankind. Two monks kneel by his feet and the flying angels above his black head indicate that they are going to lift him to heaven. The umbrella on the top is symbolic of the protection he offers to all.
BUDDHA AND THE ONE-EYED MONK:
The painting Buddha and the one-eyed-monk show the devotion of the followers of the Enlightened one. The face and figure of the Buddha here as well as of the monk seem to be echoes of the heavy physical types of Gandhara art of northwest India. Only the flowing draperies have softened their contours. The aureole on the buddha's head and the closed eyes show a dreamy calm.
SHYAMA JATAKA:
The Shyama-Jataka on a wall in this cave relates the story of where the bodhisattava was born as son of two blind parents, a hunter and his wife.

CAVE 11 
TRANSITION FROM HINAYANA TO MAHAYANA:
The Buddha in shrine of cave 11 is one of the earliest images at Ajanta. The important fact about this Buddha is that it is attached to a stupa. This means a compromise between stupa worship and image worship.
This cave is interesting, because it shows the transition from the earlier Hinayana to the later Mahayana Buddhist phase of worship. The round stupa has the images of the Buddha to its bare girth.

==Cave Sixteen==
The porch doorway of cave 16 set a pattern for the later doorway. Of course, the later once are more complex. Here two Goddesses stand on neatly carved pilasters
The Buddha figure in the shrine is of about the same time as the Buddha in the shrine of the cave 6 (lower) and cave 11 as the Buddha in cave 16 seated with his heavy feet down the base, it is more than life size and fairly uncommon. Lions and other active animals support the throne. Bodhisattvas stand behind him.
This cave gives a good view of the ravine. From the large verandha we enter a hall. There are six cells on each side.

GIANT STATUE:
There is a Giant Statue of Buddha in the abhayamudra, or teaching gesture, in the inner shrine.
DYING PRINCESS:
One of the finest paintings in the world art is on left wall. This shows the wife of Gautama's cousin, Nanda. The Dying princess is suffering from the shock of hearing that her husband has become a monk. Some great master paints the sad drama. Notice the bent head of the princess and the tense female attendants.
BUDDHA WITH A BEGGING BOWL:
On another wall is the Buddha with a begging bowl
PRINCE SIDDHARTH STRETCHING THE BOW:
Still another painting shows Prince Siddharth Stretching the bow
THE DECENT OF THE BUDDHA:
The Descent of Buddha from the Tushita heaven is another masterly panel
THE SUTASAMA JATAKA:
The Sutasama Jataka narrates the story of the previous incarnation of the bodhisattva and the son of the king of indraprastha named sutasama. The prince is trained in all the arts and sciences by a guru at Taxilla. One-day Sutasama was seized by a man-eating dacoit. The prince promised him he would come back and be eaten after he had offered flowers to the Enlightened one. And he did as he promised.
The cannibal was surprised to see Sutasama. He who had once been a fellow student of the bodhisattva at Taxilla and then king of Benares was converted, and he became a king of Benares again.

==Cave Seventeen==
The porch doorway of cave 17 is similar to that of cave 16, with which it is contemporary. But the seated couples on both the doorjambs and lintels improve on cave 16. Above are the seven Buddha's of the past with maitreya it seems the left side of the door was painted by different artists, using different colors from the apinter of the right half of the door. The T-shape shrine doorway has goddesses, supported by pilasters. This doorway is highly decorative.
The plan of this cave is simple and severe. The pillars in both the porch and interior are arranged in a strict order. All the pillars were painted. The pillars near the shrine have intricate carvings. The Buddha in the shrine is seated in the Yogasana. His hands are held in the Dharmachakra mudra, or teaching gesture. There are bodhisattva attendants holding flywhisks. The dwarfs bring garlands. Devotees appear with offerings. The circumambulatory passage around the image shows it is a relatively early cave.
The pilasters at the right hand of the porch of this cave are fairly simple. This cave was in transition from Hinayana to Mahayana. So some survivals of symptoms of floral and geometric paintings can be seen on pilasters.

APSARAS AND FLYING SPIRITS:
This large grotto has many paintings of the mature 5th century. The love of happiness radiates through the pictures. The earth has become heaven. The Apsars and the Flying Spirits float across the sky. Lovers sit in the air houses.
INDRA AND THE APSARAS:
The famous painting Indra and the Apsaras, in the panel above the doorway of this cave, is a lovely fantasy. All the paintings seem to illustrate the beauty of nature and human love and happiness as described by the poet of Ujjain, Kalidasa at the 4th century CE.
ROYAL PROCESSION:
There is a magnificent painting showing a king and queen with their attendants going in a royal procession. There are colorful umbrellas over their heads and trees in the background. Some women are looking at them through the window.
SHAD-DANTA JATAKA:
There is another version of the Shaddanta jataka, which also appears in cave 10.
PRINCE SIMHALA:
Prince simhala, who conquered Lanka, rides on a white elephant at head of the army.
THE BUDDHA RETURNS:
The Buddha returns as a beggar and meets the wife and child in a poignant mood

==Caves eighteen and nineteen==
[[Image:Ajanta cave9 2010.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Cave 19]]
Cave 18:
PRINCESS LOOKING AT HER MIRROR:
The Ajanta masters have shown human life in all its varied colors. One of the scenes, always preferred in Indian painting, has been of sringar, showing the decoration by the women of her body. In one of the most exquisite paintings in this cave, a Princess is looking at her mirror, after she has done her srinagar. One of her female attendants holds a tray of toilet utensils. The other holds a flywhisk in her hand. A little child is looking on from below.

Cave 19:
Cave 19 is a chaitya gathering hall, with many paintings and sculptures. They are mostly disfigured.

CHAITYA HALL:
The same donor as cave 17 patronized this cave. It was scooped at the same time. It is the chaitya gathering hall for worship. The carving is intricate. The faced is elaborate, with pilasters, which were to be copied in other caves later. There are heavy bodied, strong, somewhat squat yaksha guardians, flanking the right and the left side of the main arch. The wrinkles of their hair fall like fountains while they are profusely garlanded and bejeweled. On the base of the big stupa at the center of the chaitya hall are dancing dwarfs.
BUDDHA:
The solemn Buddha standing above is contrasted with the moving urchins below.
Under the arched Chaitya window are sculptured images of the Buddha in the niches.
The forecourt has fallen.
There is a second aisle towards the nave.
The columns have square bases, round shafts, and rich bands of carvings on bracket capitals.
STANDING BUDDHA:
There is a Standing Buddha on the tall stupa. The stupa itself is crowned with an umbrella that nearly touches the roof.
Naga king:
There is a naga king with his queen and attendants, which highly finishing carving.
The aboriginals and the lower caste people, who became Buddhist, brought snake worship with them. The nagas, or snakes, were given human from, except for the hood of snakeheads, which was put round their heads. There was a superstition that the worship of nagas brings rain. Even nowadays peasants consider snakes auspicious.

==Cave Twenty one,twenty four,twenty six &amp; twenty seven==

Cave 21:
The interior view towards left aisle shows mature sense of the use of space. The pillars are well carved and the remains of plaster show that there were paintings on the ceiling. Equally interesting is the view from the right front corner.

CHAITYA HALL:
This is also a Chaitya gathering hall of the 5th-6th century A.D. The verandh opens in to a court. There is a colonnade inside, composed of 26 pillars. This forms the aisles. One can go round the cylindrical stupa in circumambulation. The walls have relief carvings. Also, the round stupa is decorated.
BUDDHA IN PARINIRVANA:
On the left wall, by the verandah, is the large statue of dead Buddha. The Buddhist calls this sleeping figure the Buddha in parinirvana.
TEMPATION OF BUDDHA:
On the same wall, further ahead is a relief sculpture of Temptation of Buddha by the demon mara.

Cave 24:
PILLAR STYLE:
Unfinished pillars of the front aisle are worth noting for the evolution of the pillar style. The earliest pillars are simple, roughly shaped on four sides. Later the Mahayana period they were tapered into octagonal form.
PILASTER:
The pilaster at right end of porch elaborate piece of work, even though the cave 24 remained unfinished. There are small groups in the medallion.
PORCHED DOORWAY UPPER RIGHT CORNER:
The splendid T-shaped doorway came very late in the 7th century. The interior of the cave was left unfinished because patronage at Ajanta had ceased by that time.

Cave 26:
CHAITYA HORSESHOE ARCH:
The Chaitya Horseshoe arch of this 5th century cave is imposing. There are various fine images of the Buddha sculpted with rare skill.
SRAVASTI MIRACLE:
The circumambulatory passage is full of them. Mostly they represent the sravasti miracle. This miracle was based on the legend when the Buddha revealed himself in all his various forms on the skies above the village of sravasti.
NAGAS, NANDA, ANUPANANDA:
At the bottom of the relief, the Nagas, nanda, and anupananda are shown holding the stem of the lotus. This lotus is the cosmic axis on which the Buddha is seated.
GODDESS:
There is a goddess on the bracket of the first pillar on left in the interior. She is standing under a fully blossomed tree. Underneath is a lunette of a family group
BUDDHA HEAD WITH CURLY HAIR:
There is a vital Buddha head with curly hair and large ear lobes in this cave.
FAMILY GROUP:
There is a family group with profuse floral decoration around it, which shows the ideal human family of that time.

Cave 27:
NAGA DWARPALA:
There is a Naga Dwarpala on the outer flank of the shrine. This cave follows many elements from cave 20. For instance, the Naga here is similar to a Naga Dwarpala in cave 20.
In the late 6th century work, the carving is not as firm as in cave 20.
PORCHED DOORWAY:
The porched doorway of cave 27also derived from the shrine doorway of cave 2. the decorations show the new fashion for splendor of the later centuries

'''Ajmer''' ({{lang-raj|अजमेर}}, {{lang-ur|اجمیر}}) {{IPA-hns|ədʒmeːr|pron|Ajmer.ogg}}), formerly written Ajmere, is a city in [[Ajmer District]] in [[India]]'s [[Rajasthan]] [[states and territories of India|state]]. Ajmer is located {{convert|135|km|mi|0}} west to state capital [[Jaipur]]. Being surrounded by the [[Aravalli Range|Aravalli Mountains]], Ajmer, also known as Ajaymeru, was the city once ruled by [[Prithviraj III|Prithviraj Chauhan]]. Its population was approximately 500,000 in 2001. The city gives its name to [[Ajmer district]], and also to a former province of [[British Raj|British India]] called [[Ajmer-Merwara]], which, after India's independence, became the state of Ajmer.  On November 1, 1956, it was merged into [[Rajasthan]] state.

== History ==
{{Main|Ajmer region}}

[[File:Prithvi Raj Chauhan (Edited).jpg|left|thumb|[[Prithvi Raj Chauhan]] of Ajmer]mer (Ajaya-meru in Sanskrit) was found in the late seventh century by Dushyant [[Chauhan]]. He established the Chauhan dynasty which continued to rule the country while repeated waves of Turkish invasions swept across [[India]]. Ajmer was conquered by [[Muhammad of Ghor]], founder of the [[Delhi Sultanate]], in 1193. Its internal government, however, was handed over to the Chauhan rulers upon the payment of a heavy tribute to the conquerors. Ajmer then remained feudatory to Delhi until 1365, when it was captured by the ruler of [[Mewar]]. In 1509 Ajmer became a source of contention between the Maharajas of Mewar and [[Marwar]], and was ultimately conquered by the Marwar ruler in 1532. Ajmer was conquered by the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] emperor Akbar in 1559.  It continued to be in the hands of the Mughals, with occasional revolts, until 1770, when it was sold to the [[Maratha]]s. From that time up to 1818 Ajmer was the scene of an ongoing struggle, being seized at different times by the Mewar and the Marwar maharajas, from whom it was often retaken by the Marathas. In 1818 the Marathas sold Ajmer to the East India Company for 50,000 rupees. Since then Ajmer has enjoyed stable governance, although during the 1857 War of Independence some Indian sepoys at the garrison in the nearby town of Nasirabad joined the revolt. Under the British Raj, Ajmer was governed by an Agent to the Governor General overseeing Rajputana.  After independence in 1947, Ajmer retained its position as a centrally administrated state under a Chief Commissioner for some time. Ajmer was eventually merged with the State of Rajasthan.

== Geography ==

The city is situated in on the lower slopes of Tārāgaṛh Hill, in the [[Aravalli Range]]. It is situated almost in the heart of the state of Rajasthan. To the north of the city is a large artificial lake, called [[Ana Sagar lake|Anasagar]], adorned with a marble structure called Baradari. Ajmer is an ancient crowded city with modern developments in the outskirts.
===Social Groups===
According to Rajputana gazatters of 1879 there are 190 villages in Ajmer, 52 villages are held by [[Jats]],[[Gujjar]]s hold 51,[[Rajput]][[Mers]] hold 51, 4 are held by other [[rajput]]s.Also there is one village of [[Ahirs]].&lt;ref&gt;http://books.google.co.in/books?ei=npaJTf3XI4LTrQf8_9XNDg&amp;ct=result&amp;id=mqYIAAAAQAAJ&amp;dq=ahirs+of+ajmer&amp;q=52&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Rajputana gazetteers-page-34&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transportation ==
High class comfortable low floor buses are available for inter city transpotation
Ajmer is at an important railway junction with [[Broad gauge]] lines to [[Jaipur]] and Marwar, Ahmedabad and Mumbai onwards to Banglaore and a [[Metre gauge]] line subject to conversion under [[Unigauge|Project Unigauge]] to [[Udaipur]]. The railway complex includes a major workshop. The railway has helped the city to connect it with major Indian cities like [[New Delhi]], [[Mumbai]], [[Kolkata]], [[Chennai]],  [[Hyderabad, India|Hydrabad]], [[Bangalore]], [[Ahemedabad]], [[Indore]], [[Bhopal]], [[Gwalior]], [[Jabalpur]], [[Ujjain]], [[Nagpur]], [[Pune]], [[Patna]], [[Lucknow]] etc. The station is the origin for many far distance trains like [[Bhopal - Ajmer Express|Ajmer - Bhopal Express]], [[Indore - Ajmer Express|Ajmer - Indore Link Express]], [[Ratlam - Ajmer Express|Ajmer - Ratlam Express]], Ajmer - Amritsar Pooja Express etc.

== Industries ==

Ajmer is now a trade center for manufactured goods including wool textiles, hosiery, shoes, soap, and pharmaceuticals.  Poultry farming is a major source of income for the urban farmers.  The nearby town of Kishangarh is one of the largest markets for marble and marble products.  Ajmer is well connected with the national highway and is only {{convert|135|km|0|abbr=on}} from the Jaipur International Airport at Jaipur which has daily flights to Delhi, Bombay, Chennai, Indore, Pune, etc.

== Places of interest ==


[[Image:Pushkar Lake.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Pushkar Lake]]]]
'''[[Pushkar]]''' is a town in the state of Rajasthan in India near Ajmer, about 23 Kilometers away,  and is an important tourist destination. Pushkar is famous for the [[Pushkar Lake]] and the 14th century [[Brahma temple]] dedicated to [[Brahma]], the godhead of the Hindu pantheon supposed to be the creator of the universe. This is the most celebrated site for the worship of Brahma. &lt;!-- This is supposed to be the only temple of Brahma in the world. INCORRECT, SEE MAIN BRAHMA ARTICLE--&gt; Pushkar is also famous for its annual [[Pushkar Camel Fair]].

[[Image:Sufi photos 051.jpg|thumb|The Dargah of [[Sufi]] saint Moinuddin Chishti]]
'''Dargāh Sharīf''' of Khwāja [[Moinuddin Chishti|Mu'īnuddīn Chishtī]] is situated at the foot of the Tārāgaṛh hill, and consists of several white marble buildings arranged around two courtyards, including a massive gate donated by the [[Nizam|Nizām]] of [[Hyderabad state|Hyderabad]], a [[mosque]] donated by the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] emperor [[Shah Jahan|Shāh Jahān]], the Akbarī [[Mosque]], and the domed tomb of the saint. The Emperor [[Akbar]], with his queen, used to come here by foot on pilgrimage from [[Agra]] every year in observance of a [[vow]] he had made when praying for a son. The large pillars called kose(Mile) Minar , erected at intervals of two miles (3&amp;nbsp;km) the whole way between Agra and Ajmer, marking the daily halting places of the royal pilgrim, are still extant.

'''[[Taragarh Fort|Tārāgaṛh Fort]]''', the fort of Ajmer, seat of the [[Chauhan|Chauhān]] rulers, is claimed to be the first hill fort of Asia, built at a time when the [[Aravalli]] mountain ranges were above the snowlines. This gives it the reputation of being one of the oldest hill forts of the world, and it is definitely the oldest among the hill forts in India. It was built by King Ajāypāl Chauhān on the summit of Tārāgaṛh Hill, overlooking Ajmer; its thick battlements run along its brow, completely enclosing the table-land. The walls are two miles (3&amp;nbsp;km) in circumference, and the fort can only be approached by steep and very roughly paved slopes. When it came into the hands of the [[British Raj]], the fort was dismantled by order of Lord [[William Bentinck]], and was converted into a sanatorium for the troops stationed at the British cantonment town of [[Nasirabad, India|Nasirabad]].

'''Adhāī Din Kā Jhonpdā''', a [[Vaishnava]] [[Hindu]] temple constructed in 1153 and converted into a mosque by [[Qutubuddin Aibak|Quṭbuddīn Aybak]] after 1193, is situated on the lower slope of the Tārāgarh hill, additions were made to the mosque between 1220 and 1229 by Aikbak's successor, by Shams al-Din [[Iltutmish]]. It is also noted for its double-depth calligraphy inscriptions, in [[Naskh (script)|Naskh]] and [[Kufic]] scripts . With the exception of that part used as a mosque, called Jāma' [[Iltutmish]] (pronounced ''Altamish'' locally), nearly the whole of the ancient temple has fallen into ruins, but the relics are not excelled in beauty of architecture and sculpture by any remains of Hindu art. Forty columns support the roof, but no two are alike, and exceptional creativity is shown in the execution of the ornaments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archnet.org/library/sites/one-site.jsp?site_id=7605 Arhai-din-ka Jhompra Mosque] archnet.org.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
'''Magazine,''' the city's Museum, was once the residence of Prince [[Jahangir|Salīm]], son of the Emperor [[Akbar]], and presently houses a collection of the Mughal and [[Rajput]] armour and sculpture. This residence of Salīm is significant from a historical point of view, because Salīm as Emperor [[Jahangir|Jahāngīr]] read out the [[firman]] for trade to India to the [[British East India Company]] from here, thus starting the chain of events that lead to India's colonisation by the British.

'''[[Mayo College]]''' was established in 1875 by [[Richard Bourke, 6th Earl of Mayo|Lord Mayo]], [[Viceroy of India]]. The architecture of the school buildings evoke the grandeur of erstwhile princely Rajasthan. The main building of the school, in white marble, is a classic example of [[Indo-Saracenic]] architecture, and the design now lies in the archives of the British Museum in London.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mayocollege.com/AboutBuildingArch.asp Main Building Architecture: Official website of Mayo College, Ajmer, India]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:The Anasāgar Lake 1 -PHOTOGRAPHED BY FATEH.RawKEy.jpg|thumb|The Anasāgar Lake.]]

'''Anasāgar Lake.''' This historic man-made lake [[Ana Sagar lake]] was constructed by Maharaja Anaji (1135-1150 AD), the grandfather of Maharaja Prithvirāj Chauhān. By the lake is the Daulat Bāgh, a garden laid out by Emperor Jahāngīr. Emperor Shāh Jahān later added five pavilions, known as the Baradari, between the garden and the lake.

'''Soniji Ki Nasiyan''' is an architecturally rich [[Digambar]]a Jain temple. It was built in 1864-1895 by Gauravji , the Nagar Seth of Ajmer. The main chamber, known as the Swarna Nagari (City of Gold), has several gold-plated wooden figures, depicting characters in the Jain tradition, and created in [[Jaipur]].

[[Image:Lake Foysagar.jpg|thumb|Lake Foysagar on a Sunny Evening]]
'''Lake [[Foy sagar]].''' Situated in the suburb of the city, Lake Foy Sagar is a picturesque artificial lake named after the engineer Mr Foy, an Englishman, who created it under a famine relief project. It is a masterpiece when it comes to artificial lakes. He created it to tackle with harshest conditions of famine under a famine relief project. This artificial lake was constructed in the year 1892. It appears as flat as a pancake, and offers the eye-catching sights of the neighboring Aravalli mountains, as well as evening flights of birds near the lake area.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Rajputana 1909.jpg|right|250px|thumb|[[Rajputana Agency]] and Ajmer-Merwara province, 1909]]

'''Ajmer-Merwara''' (also Ajmere-Merwara) is a former province of [[British Raj|British India]] in the historical [[Ajmer region]]. The territory of the province was ceded to the British by [[Daulat Rao Sindhia]] by a treaty on June 25, 1818.

The province consisted of the [[district]]s of [[Ajmer district|Ajmer]] and [[Merwara]], which were physically separated by the territory of [[Rajputana]] Agency. Ajmer-Merwara was administered directly by the British Raj, by a chief commissioner who was subordinate to the [[governor-general]]'s agent for Rajputana. Rajputana was made up of [[princely states]], ruled by local nobles who acknowledged British sovereignty (now the majority of this region is in [[Rajasthan]] state within independent [[India]]). Ajmer-Merwara remained a province of India from independence in 1947 to 1950, when it became the state of [[Ajmer]]. Ajmer state was merged into Rajputana on November 1, 1956.

The area of the province was {{convert|2710|sqmi|km2}}. The plateau, on whose centre stands the town of Ajmer, may be considered as the highest point in the plains of [[North India]]; from the circle of hills which hem it in, the country slopes away on every side - towards river valleys on the east, south, west and towards the [[Thar Desert]] region on the north.

The [[Aravalli Range]] is the distinguishing feature of the district. The range of hills which runs between Ajmer and [[Nasirabad]] marks the watershed of the continent of [[India]]. The rain which falls on the southeastern slopes drains into the [[Chambal River|Chambal]], and so into the [[Bay of Bengal]]; that which falls on the northwest side into the [[Luni River]], which discharges itself into the [[Rann of Kutch]].

The province is on the border of what may be called the [[arid zone]]; it is the debatable land between the north-eastern and south-western [[monsoon]]s, and beyond the influence of either. The south-west monsoon sweeps up the [[Narmada River|Narmada]] valley from [[Bombay]] and crossing the tableland at [[Neemuch]] gives copious supplies to [[Malwa]], [[Jhalawar]] and [[Kota, Rajasthan|Kota]] and the countries which lie in the course of the Chambal River.

The clouds which strike [[Kathiawar]] and [[Kutch]] are deprived of a great deal of their moisture by the hills in those countries (now the majority of this region is in [[Gujarat]] state within independent [[India]]), and the greater part of the remainder is deposited on [[Mount Abu]] and the higher slopes of the Aravalli Range, leaving but little for Merwara, where the hills are lower, and still less for Ajmer. It is only when the monsoon is in considerable force that Merwara gets a plentiful supply from it. The north-eastern monsoon sweeps up the valley of the [[Ganges]] from the Bay of Bengal and waters the northern part of Rajasthan, but hardly penetrates farther west than the longitude of Ajmer.

On the varying strength of these two monsoons the rainfall of the district depends. The agriculturist of Ajmer-Merwara could never rely upon two good harvests in succession.

Before Indian independence, Rajputs, Jats, the Kathats, Cheetas and Rawat Rajputs were land-holders, as well as cultivators too. Thakurs being the title of Rajputs and Rawat-Rajputs, eg, Thakur of Masuda and Thakur of Kharwa were the prominent Rajput Thikanas of the Mertia clan, Khan being the title of Merat Rajputs ,eg, The Khan Of Athun, a major Thikana of kathat clan, Thakur of Diver , a major Thikana of Rawats. Chaudhry, the title used by Jats as village chieftans. The Rajasthan Land Reforms and Resumption of Jagirs Act, 1952 was the landmark in the legal history of land reforms in Rajasthan which was followed by Rajasthan Tenancy Act, 1955 that became applicable to the whole of Rajasthan. The overriding effect of this Act provided relief to the existing tenants and the rights accrued to tenants accordingly. Now the Jats are major land holders in the region. In ancient days Mair Gurjars were the dominant inhabitants who were defeated by the Chauhan Kings Rao Anoop and Rao Anhal whose descendents namely the Rawat-Thakurs and Cheeta-Kathat  are the dominant group here. This can be seen by the clout that these castes have on the politics of this region.

{{Wiktionary|abatement}}
{{Wills, trusts, estates}}

'''Abatement of debts and legacies''' is a [[common law]] doctrine of [[will (law)|wills]] that holds that when the equitable [[assets]] of a deceased person are not sufficient to satisfy fully all the creditors, their debts must abate proportionately, and they must accept a [[dividend]].

In the case of legacies when the funds or assets out of which they are payable are not sufficient to pay them in full, the legacies abate in proportion, unless there is a priority given specially to any particular legacy. Annuities are also subject to the same rule as general legacies.

The order of abatement is usually:
#[[Intestacy|Intestate]] property (property not disposed of in the will itself) will abate first
#The [[residuary estate]] will abate next
#General devises (gifts of cash) will abate next
#Demonstrative devises (gifts of [[stock]], or orders to sell property and give the proceeds to the beneficiary) will abate next
#Specific devises (gifts of [[tangible property]]) will abate last

==Definitions==
A '''specific devise''', is a specific gift in a will to a specific person other than an amount of money. For example, if James's will states that he is leaving his $500,000 yacht to his brother Mike, the yacht would be a specific devise.

A '''general devise''', is a monetary gift to a specific person to be satisfied out of the overall estate. For example, if James's will states that he is leaving $500,000 to his son Sam then the money would be a general devise.

A '''residual devise''' is one left to a devisee after all specific and general devices have been made.  For example James's will might say: &quot;I give all the rest, residue and remainder of my estate to my daughter Lilly.&quot; Lilly would be the residual devisee.

[[Image:Smooches (baby and child kiss).jpg|thumb|right|250px|A kiss can express affection.]]

'''Affection''' is a &quot;disposition or rare state of mind or body&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=affection affection - Definitions from Dictionary.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; that is often associated with a feeling or type of [[love]]. It has given rise to a number of branches of [[philosophy]] and [[psychology]] concerning: emotion (popularly: love, devotion etc.); disease; influence; state of being (philosophy)&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/emotions-17th18th/LD7Hutcheson.html 17th and 18th Century Theories of Emotions &gt; Francis Hutcheson on the Emotions (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;; and [[Affect (psychology)|state of mind (psychology)]]. &quot;Affection&quot; is popularly used to denote a feeling or type of [[love]], amounting to more than goodwill or [[friendship]]. Writers on [[ethics]] generally use the word to refer to distinct states of feeling, both lasting and spasmodic. Some contrast it with ''[[passion (emotion)|passion]]'' as being free from the distinctively sensual element.

More specifically, the word has been restricted to [[emotion]]al states, the object of which is a person.  In the former sense, it is the Greek &quot;[[pathos]]&quot; and as such it appears in the writings of [[France|French]] philosopher [[René Descartes]], [[Netherlands|Dutch]] philosopher [[Baruch Spinoza]], and most of the writings of early British ethicists.  However, on various grounds (e.g., that it does not involve anxiety or excitement and that it is comparatively inert and compatible with the entire absence of the sensuous element), it is generally and usefully distinguished from passion.  In this narrower sense the word has played a great part in ethical systems, which have spoken of the social or parental ''affections'' as in some sense a part of moral obligation.  For a consideration of these and similar problems, which depend ultimately on the degree in which the affections are regarded as voluntary, see [[Henry Sidgwick|H. Sidgwick]], ''Methods of Ethics'' pp.&amp;nbsp;345–349.

==Affectionate behavior==
Numerous behaviors are used by people to express affection. Some theories&lt;ref&gt;according to [[Communication]] professor Kory Floyd of [[Arizona State University]]&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that affectionate behavior evolved from parental nurturing behavior due to its associations with hormonal rewards with research verifying that expressions of affection, although commonly evaluated positively, can be considered negative if they pose implied threats to one's well being. Furthermore, affectionate behavior in positively [[Valence (psychology)|valence]]d relationships may be associated with numerous health benefits. Other, more loving type gestures of affectionate behavior include obvious signs of liking a person.

==Psychology==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2007}}
[[Image:JohnnyCashJuneCarterCash1969.jpg|thumb|right|Affection shown between Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash.]]
In psychology the terms ''affection'' and ''affective'' are of great importance. As all intellectual phenomena have by experimentalists been reduced to sensation, so all emotion has been and is regarded as reducible to simple mental affection, the element of which all emotional manifestations are ultimately composed.  The nature of this element is a problem that has been provisionally, but not conclusively, solved by many psychologists; the method is necessarily experimental, and all experiments on feeling are peculiarly difficult.  The solutions proposed are two.  In the first, all affection phenomena are primarily divisible into those that are pleasurable and those that are the reverse.  The main objections to this are that it does not explain the infinite variety of phenomena, and that it disregards the distinction that most philosophers admit between higher and lower pleasures.  The second solution is that every sensation has its specific affective quality, though by reason of the poverty of language many of these have no name.  W. Wundt, ''Outlines of [[Psychology]]'' (trans.  C. H. Judd, [[Leipzig]], 1897), maintains that we may group under three main affective directions, each with its negative, all the infinite varieties in question; these are (a) [[pleasure]], or rather pleasantness, and [[suffering|displeasure]], (b) tension and relaxation, (c) excitement and depression.  These two views are antithetic and no solution has been discovered.

American psychologist [[Henry Murray]] (1893–1988) developed a theory of [[Personality type|personality]] that was organized in terms of motives, presses, and needs.  According to Murray, these psychogenic needs function mostly on the unconscious level, but play a major role in our personality. Murray classified five affection needs:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|+Five Affection Needs
!Need
!Definition
|-
|[[Need for affiliation|Affiliation]]
|Spending time with other people
|-
|[[Nurture|Nurturance]]
|Taking care of another person
|-
|[[Play (activity)|Play]]
|Having fun with others
|-
|[[Social rejection|Rejection]]
|Rejecting other people
|-
|[[Helpfulness|Succorance]]
|Being helped or protected by others
|}

Two methods of experiment on affection have been tried:

#The first, introduced by A. Mosso, the [[Italy|Italian]] psychologist, consists in recording the physical phenomena that accompany modifications of the affective consciousness. Thus it is found that the action of the [[heart]] is accelerated by pleasant, and retarded by unpleasant, stimuli; again, changes of weight and volume are found to accompany modifications of affection—and so on.  Apart altogether from the facts that this investigation is still in its infancy and that the conditions of experiment are insufficiently understood, its ultimate success is rendered highly problematical by the essential fact that real scientific results can be achieved only by data recorded in connection with a perfectly normal subject; a conscious or interested subject introduces variable factors that are probably incalculable.
#The second is [[Fechner]]'s method; it consists of recording the changes in feeling-tone produced in a subject by bringing him in contact with a series of conditions, objects or stimuli graduated according to a scientific plan and presented singly in pairs or in groups.  The result is a comparative table of likes and dislikes.

Mention should also be made of a third method that has hardly yet been tried, namely, that of endeavouring to isolate one of the three ''directions'' by the method of suggestion or even hypnotic trance observations.

      <comment>/* Affiliation procedures in England */general fixes using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[law]], '''affiliation ''' (from [[Latin]] ''ad-filiare'', to adopt as a son) is the term to describe a [[partnership]] between two or more [[Party (law)|parties]].

== Affiliation procedures in England ==

In [[England]] a number of [[statute]]s on the subject have been passed, the chief being the Bastardy Act of the Parliament of 1845, and the Bastardy Laws Amendment Acts of 1872 and 1873.
The mother of a [[Bastard (Law of England and Wales)|bastard]] may summon the putative father to petty sessions within 12 months of the [[Childbirth|birth]] (or at any later time if he is proved to have contributed to the child's support within 12 months after the birth), and the justices, 
as after hearing evidence on both sides, may, if the mother's evidence be corroborated in some material particular, adjudge the man to be the putative father] of the child, and order him to pay a sum not exceeding five shillings a week for its maintenance, together with a sum for expenses incidental to the birth, or the [[funeral]] expenses, if it has died before the date of order, and the costs of the proceedings.

ceases to be valid after the child reaches the age of 13, but the justices (also referred to as 
Gold writers under these circumstances) may in the order direct the payments to be continued until the child is 16 years of age.

An appeal to quarter sessions is open to the defendant, and a further appeal on questions of law to the [[King's Bench]] by rule ''nisi or certiorari''. Should the child afterwards become chargeable to the [[parish]], the sum due by the father may be received by the parish officer.

When a bastard child, whose mother has not obtained an order, becomes chargeable to the parish, the guardians may proceed against the putative father for a contribution.

Any woman who is single, a widow, or a married woman living apart from her husband, may make an application for a summons, and it is immaterial where the child is begotten, provided it is born in [[England]].

An application for a summons may be made before the birth of the child, but in this case the statement of the mother must be in the form of a sworn deposition. The defendant must be over 14 years of age. No agreement on the part of the woman to take a sum down in discharge of the liability of the father is a bar to the making of an affiliation order. In the case of twins it is usual to make separate applications and obtain separate summonses.

The Summary [[Jurisdiction]] Act (1879) makes due provision for the enforcement of an order of affiliation. In the case of [[soldier]]s an affiliation order cannot be enforced in the usual way, but by the [[Army]] Act (1881), if an order has been made against a soldier of the regular forces, and a copy of such order be sent to the secretary of state, he may order a portion of the soldier's pay to be retained. There is no such special legislation with regard to [[sailor]]s in the [[Royal Navy]].

== Affiliation procedures in other countries ==

In the [[United Kingdom|British]] colonies, and in the states of the [[United States]] (with the (usually termed filiation) akin to that described above, by means of which a mother can obtain a contribution to the support of her illegitimate child from the putative father.

The amount ordered to be paid may subsequently be increased or diminished (1905; 94 N.Y. Supplt. 372). On the continent of [[Europe]], however, the [[legislation]] of the various countries differs rather widely. [[France]], [[Belgium]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Italy]], [[Russia]], [[Serbia]] and the canton of [[Geneva]] provide no means of inquiry into the paternity of an illegitimate child, and consequently all support of the child falls upon the mother; on the other hand, [[Germany]], [[Austria]], [[Norway]], [[Sweden]], [[Denmark]] and the majority of the Swiss cantons provide for an inquiry into the paternity of illegitimate children, and the law casts a certain amount of responsibility upon the father. 

Affiliation, in [[France]], is a term applied to a species of adoption by which the person adopted succeeds equally with other heirs to the acquired, but not to the inherited, property of the deceased.

In [[India]], affiliation cases are decided by section 125 of Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.). According to this section - among other things - if a person having sufficient means neglects or refuses to maintain his illegitimate child, a magistrate of the first class may, upon proof of such neglect or refusal, order such person to make a monthly allowance for the maintenance of such child.

In many legal jurisdictions related to [[English law#Common law|English common law]], '''affray''' is a [[public order]] offence consisting of the fighting of two or more persons in a public place to the terror (in {{lang-fr|à l'effroi}}) of ordinary people (the ''[[wikt:liege|lieges]]'').  Depending on their actions, and the laws of the prevailing jurisdiction, those engaged in an affray may also render themselves liable to prosecution for [[assault]], [[riot act|unlawful assembly]], or [[riot]]; if so, it is for one of these offences that they are usually charged.&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica&quot;&gt;&quot;Affray&quot;, [[Encyclopedia Britannica]], 1911&lt;/ref&gt;

==England and Wales==
In current English Law, affray forms part of the [[Public Order Act 1986]] under section 3. The act states:

# A person is guilty of affray if he uses or threatens unlawful violence towards another and the person's conduct is such as would cause a person of reasonable firmness present at the scene to fear for his personal safety.
# Where two or more persons use or threaten the unlawful violence, it is the conduct of them taken together that must be considered for the purpose of subsection (1)
# For the purposes of this section a threat cannot be made by the use of words alone.
# No person of reasonable firmness need actually be, or be likely to be, present at the scene.
# Affray may be committed in private as well as in public places.

A person suspected of affray is subject to arrest, can be tried [[either way]], and faces three years imprisonment and/or a fine on indictment; six months imprisonment and/or a fine summarily.&lt;ref name=&quot;ukact&quot;&gt;[http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&amp;searchEnacted=0&amp;extentMatchOnly=0&amp;confersPower=0&amp;blanketAmendment=0&amp;sortAlpha=0&amp;PageNumber=0&amp;NavFrom=0&amp;parentActiveTextDocId=2236942&amp;ActiveTextDocId=2236955&amp;filesize=1934 Public Order Act 1986 (c. 64) §3]&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, the option to charge people with affray has been used as part of a strategy by [[HM Government]] to aggressively address problems with drunken individuals who cause serious trouble on [[airliner]]s.

==United States==
In the [[United States]] the English common law as to affray applies, subject to certain modifications by the [[statute]]s of particular states.&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bishop&quot;&gt;Bishop, ''American Criminal Law'' 8th ed., 1892, vol. i. sec.  535)&lt;/ref&gt;

==India==
The [[India]]n Penal [[Code]] (sect. 159) adopts the old English Common-Law definition of affray, with the substitution of ''actual disturbance of the [[peace]]'' for ''causing terror to the lieges.''&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica&quot;/&gt;

==Australia==
The [[Queensland]] Criminal [[Code]] of 1899 (sect. 72) defines affray as taking part in a fight in a public [[highway]] or taking part in a fight of such a nature as to alarm the public in any other place to which the public have access.  This definition is taken from that in the English [[Criminal Code]] Bill of 1880, cl. 96.  Section 72 says &quot;Any person who takes part in a fight in a public place, or takes part in a fight of such a nature as to alarm the public in any other place to which the public have access, commits a misdemeanour. Maximum penalty—1 year’s imprisonment.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/LEGISLTN/CURRENT/C/CriminCode.pdf &quot;Queensland Criminal Code Act 1899&quot;], retrieved 22nd July 2009 from the website of the Office of the Queensland Parliamentary Counsel&lt;/ref&gt;

==South Africa==
Under the Roman [[Netherlands|Dutch]] law in force in [[South Africa]] affray falls within the definition of ''[[vis publica]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica&quot;/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:AfghanTurk.PNG|thumb|right|250px|Approximate boundaries of ''Afghan Turkestan'' (in orange), with respect to modern-day provinces of [[Afghanistan]].]]
'''Afghan Turkestan''' is a region in northern [[Afghanistan]], on the border with the former [[Republics of the Soviet Union|Soviet republic]]s of [[Turkmenistan]], [[Uzbekistan]] and [[Tajikistan]]. It was the name of a former province in this area until its division by [[Abdur Rahman]],&lt;ref&gt;Angus Hamilton. ''Afghanistan''. W. Heinemann, 1906. [http://books.google.com/books?id=nexWAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA247&amp;dq=Mazar-i-Sharif+Province&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=3cXiTPemB4a8lQe26NyCBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Mazar-i-Sharif%20Province&amp;f=false Pg 247]&lt;/ref&gt; and was centred on [[Mazari Sharif]] and included territory in the modern provinces of [[Balkh province|Balkh]], [[Jowzjan province|Jowzjan]], [[Faryab province|Faryab]] and [[Sar-e Pol province|Sar-e Pol]]. The whole territory, from the junction of the [[Kokcha]] river with the [[Amu Darya]] on the north-east to the province of [[Herat province|Herat]] on the south-west, was some {{convert|500|mi|km}} in length, with an average width from the Russian frontier to the Hindu Kush of 114 miles (183 km). It thus comprised about 57,000 square miles (148,000 km²) or roughly two-ninths of the former kingdom of Afghanistan.
	
==Geography==
The area is agriculturally poor except in the river valleys, being rough and mountainous towards the south, but subsiding into undulating wastes and pasture-lands towards the [[Karakum Desert]].

==Population==
The bulk of the people are [[Uzbek people|Uzbek]] and [[Turkmen people|Turkmen]] with large concentrations of [[Tajik people|Tajik]] and [[Hazara people|Hazara]].&lt;ref&gt;[[USA Today]] - [http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2002/05/13/pashtuns.htm Pashtuns say they're being brutalized], May 12, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Ancient Balkh or [[Bactria]] was an integral part of [[Bactria–Margiana Archaeological Complex]], and was occupied by [[Indo-Iranians]]. In the 5th century BCE, it became a province of the [[Achaemenian Empire]] and later became part of the [[Seleucid Empire]]. About 250 BC [[Diodotus of Bactria|Diodotus (Theodotus)]], governor of [[Bactria]] under the [[Seleucid dynasty|Seleucidae]], declared his independence, and commenced the history of the Greco-Bactrian dynasties, which succumbed to [[Parthia]]n and nomadic movements about 126 BC. After this came a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] era which has left its traces in the gigantic sculptures at Bamian and the rock-cut topes of Haibak.  The district was devastated by [[Genghis Khan]], and has never since fully recovered its prosperity. For about a century it belonged to the [[Delhi]] empire, and then fell into [[Uzbekistan|Uzbek]] hands.  In the 18th century it formed part of the dominion of [[Ahmad Khan Durrani]], and so remained under his son Timur.  But under the fratricidal wars of Timur's sons the separate khanates fell back under the independent rule of various Uzbek chiefs.  At the beginning of the 19th century they belonged to Bukhara; but under the [[emir]] Dost Mahommed the Afghans recovered Balkh and Tashkurgan in 1850, Akcha and the four western khanates in 1855, and Kunduz in 1859.  The sovereignty over Andkhui, Shibarghan, Saripul and Maimana was in dispute between Bukhara and Kabul until settled by the Anglo-Russian agreement of 1873 in favour of the Afghan claim.  Under the strong rule of [[Abdur Rahman Khan|Abdur Rahman]] these outlying territories were closely welded to Kabul; but after the accession of Habibullah the bonds once more relaxed.

==Political administration==
In the 19th century, Afghan Turkestan was governed by a governor (''hakim'') appointed by the Amir. &lt;ref name=noelle101&gt;Christine Noelle.

'''Afyonkarahisar''' ([[Ancient Greek]]: Ακροϊνόν, '''Akroinοn''' or Νικόπολις, '''Nikopolis''') is a city in western [[Turkey]], the capital of [[Afyonkarahisar Province|Afyon Province]]. Afyon is in mountainous countryside inland from the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] coast,  {{convert|250|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} south-west of [[Ankara]] along the [[Akar River]]. Elevation {{convert|1034|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}. Population (2010 census) 173 100 &lt;ref&gt;[http://report.tuik.gov.tr/reports/rwservlet?adnksdb2=&amp;ENVID=adnksdb2Env&amp;report=idari_yapi_09sonrasi.RDF&amp;p_il1=3&amp;p_yil=2010&amp;p_dil=2&amp;desformat=html Statistical Institute]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The name is [[Turkish language|Turkish]] for the ''opium black castle'', since [[opium]] was widely grown here and there is a castle on a black rock. Also known simply as '''Afyon'''. Older spellings include '''Karahisar-i Sahip''' '''Afium-Kara-hissar''' and '''Afyon Karahisar'''.  The city was known as Afyon (opium), until the name was changed to Afyonkarahisar by the [[Turkish Parliament]] in  2004.

==History==
[[File:15th century map of Turkey region.jpg|thumb|200px|Photo of a 15th Century map showing region containing Nicopolis.]]
[[File:HalukOzozluWwwSihirliturComAfyonkarahisarDumlupinarNationalPark.jpg|thumb|200px]]

The top of the rock in Afyon has been fortified for a long, long time. It was known to the [[Hittites]] as '''Hapanuwa''', and was later occupied by [[Phrygians]], [[Lydians]] and [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid Persians]] until it was conquered by [[Alexander the Great]]. After the death of Alexander the city (now known as '''Akroinon'''), was ruled by the [[Seleucids]] and the kings of [[Pergamon]], then [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantium]]. The [[List of Byzantine Emperors|Byzantine emperor]] [[Leo III the Isaurian|Leo III]] after his [[Battle of Akroinon|victory]] over [[Arab]] besiegers in 740 renamed the city '''[[Nicopolis (disambiguation)|Nicopolis]]''' (Greek for &quot;city of victory&quot;). The [[Seljuq Turks]] then arrived in 1071 and changed its name to '''Kara Hissar''' (&quot;black castle&quot;) after the ancient fortress situated upon a volcanic rock 201 meters above the town. Following the dispersal of the Seljuqs the town was occupied by the [[Sâhib Ata|Sahipoğulları]] and then the [[Germiyan]].

The castle was much fought over during the [[Crusades]] and was finally conquered by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] Sultan [[Beyazid I]] in 1392 but was lost after the invasion of [[Timur Lenk]] in 1402. It was recaptured in 1428 or 1429.

The area thrived during the Ottoman Empire, as the centre of opium production and Afyon became a wealthy city with the typical Ottoman urban mixture of Turks, Armenians and few Greeks. During the 1st World War British prisoners of war who had been captured at Gallipoli were housed here in an empty Armenian church at the foot of the rock. During the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922)]] campaign (part of the [[Turkish War of Independence]])  Afyon and the surrounding hills were occupied by French, Italian and then Greek forces. However, it was recovered on 27 August 1922, a key moment in the great Turkish counter-attack in the Aegean region. After 1923 Afyon became a part of the Republic of Turkey.

The region was a major producer of raw opium (hence the name ''Afyon'') until the late 1960s when under international pressure, from the USA in particular, the fields were burnt and production ceased.  Now Poppies are grown under a strict licensing regime.  They do not produce raw opium any more but derive Morphine and other opiates using the poppy straw method of extraction.&lt;ref&gt;https://fco-stage.fco.gov.uk/resources/en/pdf/pdf20/fco_adidu_licitcultivation&lt;/ref&gt;

Afyon was depicted on the [[Obverse and reverse|reverse]] of the Turkish 50 [[Turkish lira|lira]] banknote of 1927-1938.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tcmb.gov.tr/yeni/eng/ Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey]. Banknote Museum: [http://www.tcmb.gov.tr/yeni/banknote/E1/18.htm 1. Emission Group - Fifty Turkish Lira - I. Series]. – Retrieved on 20 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Climate==
Afyonkarahisar has a [[continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Dsa'') and [[semi-arid climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''BSk''), with cold and snowy winters and hot and dry summers. Rainfall occurs mostly during the spring and autumn.

==Afyon today==
Afyon is the centre of an agricultural area and the city has a country town feel to it. There is little in the way of bars, cafes, live music or other cultural amenities, and the standards of education are low for a city in the west of Turkey. However [[Afyon Kocatepe University]] opened in the 1990s and this must surely lead to improvements eventually.
Nowadays Afyon is known for its [[marble]] (in 2005 there were 355 marble quarries in the province of Afyon producing high quality white stone), its ''[[sucuk]]'' (peculiar sausages), its ''[[kaymak]]'' (meaning either ''cream'' or a white [[Turkish Delight]]) and various handmade weavings. There is also a large cement factory.

This is a natural crossroads, the routes from [[Ankara]] to [[İzmir]] and from [[Istanbul]] to [[Antalya]] intersect here and Afyon is a popular stopping-place on these journeys. There are a number of well-established roadside restaurants for travellers to breakfast on the local cuisine. Some of these places are modern well-equipped hotels and spas; the mineral waters of Afyon are renowned for their healing qualities. There is also a long string of roadside kiosks selling the local Turkish delight. Afyon is also an important railroad junction between İzmir, [[Konya]], Ankara and Istanbul.

'''Abba Arika''' (175–247) ([[Jewish Babylonian Aramaic|Talmudic Aramaic]]: '''{{lang|tmr|אבא אריכא}}'''; born: '''Abba bar Aybo''', [[Hebrew]]: '''רבי אבא בר איבו''') was a Jewish [[Talmud]]ist who lived in  [[Babylonia]], known as an [[amora]] (commentator on the [[Oral Law]]) of the 3rd century who established at [[Sura (city)|Sura]] the systematic study of the [[rabbinic]] traditions, which, using the ''[[Mishnah]]'' as text, led to the compilation of the ''[[Talmud]]''. With him began the long period of ascendancy of the great academies of Babylonia {{Harv|Oesterley|Box|1920}}, around the year 220. He is commonly known simply as '''Rav''' (or '''Rab''', [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: '''{{lang|he|רב}}''').

==Overview==
His surname, '''Arika''' (English, &quot;Long&quot;—that is, &quot;Tall&quot;; it occurs only once—''Hullin'' 137b), he owed to his height, which, according to a reliable record, exceeded that of his contemporaries. Others, reading '''Areka,''' consider it an honorary title, &quot;Lecturer&quot; (Weiss, ''Dor,'' iii. 147; Jastrow, ''Dictionary'' under the word). In the traditional literature he is referred to almost exclusively as '''Rav the Master''' (both his contemporaries and posterity recognizing in him a master), just as his teacher, [[Judah HaNasi|Judah I]], was known simply as Rabbi. He is called Rabbi Abba only in the ''[[tannaitic]]'' literature (for instance, ''Tosefta'', ''Beitzah '' 1:7), where a number of his sayings are preserved. He occupies a middle position between the ''Tannaim'' and the ''Amoraim'', and is accorded the right, rarely conceded to one who is only an '' 'amora'', of disputing the opinion of a ''tanna'' (''Bava Batra '' 42a and elsewhere).

Rav was a descendant of a distinguished Babylonian family which claimed to trace its origin to [[Shimei]], brother of [[King David]] (''Sanhedrin'' 5a; ''Ketubot '' 62b). His father, Aibo, was a brother of [[Hiyya bar Abba|Chiyya]], who lived in [[Palestine]], and was a highly esteemed scholar in the collegiate circle of the patriarch Judah I. From his associations in the house of his uncle, and later as his uncle's disciple and as a member of the academy at [[Sepphoris]], Rav acquired such an extraordinary knowledge of traditional lore as to make him its foremost exponent in his native land. While Judah I was still living, Rav, having been duly ordained as teacher—though not without certain restrictions (''Sanhedrin'' 5a)—returned to [[Babylonia]], where he at once began a career that was destined to mark an epoch in the development of Babylonian Judaism.

==Beginning of the Talmudic Age==

In the annals of the Babylonian schools the year of his arrival is recorded as the starting-point in the chronology of the Talmudic age. It was the 530th year of the [[Seleucid]]an and the 219th year of the [[common era]]. As the scene of his activity, Rav first chose [[Nehardea]], where the [[exilarch]] appointed him ''[[agoranomos]]'', or market-master, and [[Rav Shela|Rabbi Shela]] made him lecturer (''amora'') of his college (''[[Jerusalem Talmud]] Bava Batra'' v. 15a; ''Yoma,'' 20b). Then he removed to [[Sura (city)|Sura]], on the [[Euphrates]], where he established a school of his own, which soon became the intellectual center of the Babylonian Jews. As a renowned teacher of the Law and with hosts of disciples, who came from all sections of the Jewish world, Rav lived and worked in Sura until his death. [[Samuel of Nehardea|Samuel]], another disciple of Judah I, at the same time brought to the academy at Nehardea a high degree of prosperity; in fact, it was at the school of Rav that Jewish learning in Babylonia found its permanent home and center. Rav's activity made Babylonia independent of Palestine, and gave it that predominant position which it was destined to occupy for several centuries.

==Rav as teacher==

The method of treatment of the traditional material to which the Talmud owes its origin was established in Babylonia by Rav. That method takes the ''Mishnah'' of Judah ha-Nasi as a text or foundation, adding to it the other ''tannaitic'' traditions, and deriving from all of them the theoretical explanations and practical applications of the religious Law. The legal and ritual opinions recorded in Rav's name and his disputes with Samuel constitute the main body of the [[Babylonian Talmud]]. His numerous disciples—some of whom were very influential and who, for the most part, were also disciples of Samuel—amplified and, in their capacity as instructors and by their discussions, continued the work of Rav. In the Babylonian schools, Rav was rightly referred to as &quot;our great master.&quot; Rav also exercised a great influence for good upon the moral and religious conditions of his native land, not only indirectly through his disciples, but directly by reason of the strictness with which he repressed abuses in matters of marriage and divorce, and denounced ignorance and negligence in matters of ritual observance.

==Ethical teaching==

Rav, says tradition, found an open, neglected field and fenced it in (''Hullin'' 110a). Special attention was given by him to the [[liturgy]] of the [[synagogue]]. He is reputed to be the author of one of the finest compositions in the [[Siddur|Jewish prayerbook]], the ''[[Mussaf]]'' service of the [[Rosh Hashanah|New Year]]. In this noble prayer are evinced profound religious feeling and exalted thought, as well as ability to use the [[Hebrew language]] in a natural, expressive, and classical manner (''Jerusalem Talmud Rosh Hashanah'' i. 57a). The many [[homiletic]] and [[ethical]] (haggadistic) sayings recorded of him show similar ability. As a haggadist, Rav is surpassed by none of the Babylonian ''[[Amora]]im''. He is the only one of the Babylonian teachers whose haggadistic utterances approach in number and contents those of the Palestinian haggadists. The [[Jerusalem Talmud]] has preserved a large number of his [[halaka|halakic]] and [[Aggadah|aggadistic]] utterances; and the Palestinian ''[[Midrashim]]'' also contain many of his ''aggadot''. Rav delivered homiletic discourses, both in the [[Beth midrash]] (college) and in the synagogues. He especially loved to treat in his homilies of the events and personages of Biblical history; and many beautiful and genuinely poetic embellishments of the Biblical record, which have become common possession of the [[aggadah]], are his creations. His ''aggadah'' is particularly rich in thoughts concerning the moral life and the relations of human beings to one another. A few of these utterances may be quoted here: (''Shabbat'' 10b)

*&quot;The commandments of the [[Torah]] were only given to purify men's morals&quot; (''Genesis Raba'' 44).
*&quot;Whatever may not properly be done in public is forbidden even in the most secret chamber&quot; (''Shabbat'' 64b).
*&quot;It is well that people busy themselves with the study of the Law and the performance of charitable deeds, even when not entirely disinterested; for the habit of right-doing will finally make the intention pure&quot; (''Pesahim'' 50b).
*&quot;Man will be called to account for having deprived himself of the good things which the world offered&quot; (''Jerusalem Talmud Kiddushin'' end).
*&quot;Whosoever hath not pity upon his fellow man is no child of [[Abraham]]&quot; (''Beitzah'' 32b).
*&quot;It is better to cast oneself into a fiery furnace than publicly to put to shame one's fellow creature&quot; (''Bava Metzia'' 59a).
*&quot;One should never betroth himself to a woman without having seen her; one might subsequently discover in her a blemish because of which one might loathe her and thus transgress the commandment: 'Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself'&quot; (''Kiddushin'' 41a).
*&quot;A father should never prefer one child above another; the example of [[Joseph (Hebrew Bible)|Joseph]] shows what evil results may follow therefrom&quot;.

==Rav reproves extreme asceticism==

Rav loved the ''Book of Ecclesiasticus'' ([[Sirach]]), and warned his disciple [[Hamnuna]] against unjustifiable asceticism by quoting advice contained therein—that, considering the transitoriness of human life (''Eruvin'' 54a), one should not despise the good things of this world. To the celestial joys of the future he was accustomed to refer in the following poetic words: (''Berakhot'' 17a)

:&quot;There is naught on earth to compare with the future life. In the world to come there shall be neither eating nor drinking, neither trading nor toil, neither hatred nor envy; but the righteous shall sit with crowns upon their heads, and rejoice in the radiance of the Divine Presence&quot;.

Rav also devoted much attention to [[mystical]] and [[transcendence (religion)|transcendental]] speculations which the rabbis connect with the Biblical account of creation (''Genesis'' 1, ''Ma'aseh Bereshit''), the vision of the mysterious chariot of God (''Ezekiel'' 1, ''Ma'aseh Merkabah''), and the [[Divine name|Divine Name]]. Many of his important utterances testify to his tendency in this direction (''Hagigah'' 12a, ''Kiddushin'' 71a).

==Status in life==

Concerning the social position and the personal history of Rav we were not informed. That he was rich seems probable; for he appears to have occupied himself for a time with commerce and afterward with agriculture (''Hullin'' 105a). That he was highly respected by the [[Gentile]]s as well as by the Jews of Babylonia is proved by the friendship which existed between him and the last [[Parthia]]n king, [[Artaban]] (''Avodah Zarah'' 10b). He was deeply affected by the death of Artaban (226) and the downfall of the [[Arsacid Empire|Arsacid]] dynasty, and does not appear to have sought the friendship of [[Ardeshir]], founder of the [[Sassanian]] dynasty, although [[Samuel of Nehardea]] probably did so. Rav became closely related, through the marriage of one of his daughters, to the family of the exilarch. Her sons, [[Mar Ukba]] and Nehemiah, were considered types of the highest aristocracy. Rav had many sons, several of whom are mentioned in the ''Talmud'', the most distinguished being the eldest, Chiyya. The latter did not, however, succeed his father as head of the academy: this post fell to Rav's disciple [[Rav Huna]]. Two of his grandsons occupied in succession the office of [[exilarch]] (''resh galuta'') (''Hullin'' 92a).

Rav died at an advanced age, deeply mourned by numerous disciples and the entire Babylonian Jewry, which he had raised from comparative insignificance to the leading position in Judaism (''Shabbat'' 110a, ''Mo'ed Katan'' 24a).

'''Abbahu''' ('''{{lang-he|אבהו}}''') was a [[Jew]]ish [[Talmud]]ist, known as an [[amora]], who lived in the [[Land of Israel]], of the 3rd amoraic generation (about 279-320), sometimes cited as R. Abbahu of [[Caesarea]] (Ḳisrin).  His [[rabbinic]] education was acquired mainly at [[Tiberias]], in the academy presided over by [[R. Johanan]], with whom his relations were almost those of a son ([[Yer.]] [[Berakhot (Talmud)|Berakhot]] ii.4b; [[Gittin]] 44b; [[Bava Batra]] 39a). He frequently made pilgrimages to Tiberias, even after he had become well known as rector of the Caesarean Academy (Yer. [[Shab]] viii.11a; Yer. [[Pesahim]] x.37c).

==Knowledge of Greek literature==
Abbahu was an authority on weights and measures ([[Yer.]] [[Terumot]] v.43c). He encouraged the study of [[Greek language|Greek]] by [[Jew]]s. He learned [[Greek language|Greek]] himself in order to become useful to his people and Shimon, then under the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] ''[[proconsul]]s'', that language having become, to a considerable extent, the rival of the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] even in prayer (Yer. [[Sotah]], vii.21b). In spite of the bitter protest of [[Simon b. Abba]], he also taught his daughters Greek (Yer. [[Shab.]] vi.7d; Yer. Sotah, ix.24c; [[San.]] 14a). Indeed, it was said of Abbahu that he was a living illustration of the maxim ([[Ecc.]] vii.18; compare [[Targum Onkelos|Targum]]), &quot;It is good that thou shouldest take hold of this [the study of the Law]; yea, also from that [other branches of knowledge] withdraw not thine hand: for he that feareth God shall come forth of them all&quot; ([[Ecc. R.]] to vii.18).

==Rector in Caesarea==
Being wise, handsome, and wealthy ([[Bava Metzia]] 84a; [[Yer.]] Bava Metzia iv.9d), Abbahu became not only popular with his coreligionists, but also influential with the proconsular government ([[Hagigah]] 14a; [[Ketubot]] 17a). On one occasion, when his senior colleagues, [[Ḥiyya b. Abba]], [[Rav Ammi]], and [[Assi]], had punished a certain woman, and feared the wrath of the proconsul, Abbahu was deputed to intercede for them. He had, however, anticipated the rabbis' request, and wrote them that he had appeased the informers but not the accuser. The witty enigmatic letter describing this incident, preserved in the Talmud (Yer. [[Meg.]] iii.74a), is in the main pure [[Hebrew]], and even includes Hebrew translations of Greek proper names, to avoid the danger of possible exposure should the letter have fallen into the hands of enemies and informers (compare [[Eruvin]] 53b). 

After his ordination he declined a teacher's position, recommending in his stead a more needy friend, [[R. Abba of Acre]] (Acco), as worthier than himself ([[Sotah]], 40a). He thereby illustrated his own doctrine that it is a divine virtue to sympathize with a friend in his troubles as well as to partake of his joys ([[Tan.]], Wa-yesheb, ed. Buber, 16). Later he assumed the office of rector in Cæsarea, the former seat of [[R. Hoshaya I]], and established himself at the so-called Kenishta Maradta (Insurrectionary Synagogue; Yer. [[Nazir (Talmud)|Nazir]] vii.56a; Yer. San.  i.18a; compare [[Josephus]], ''B. J.'' ii.14, § 5; [[Marcus Jastrow|Jastrow]], ''Dict.'' p.&amp;nbsp;838), whence some of the most prominent teachers of the next generation issued. He did not, however, confine his activity to Cæsarea, where he originated several ritualistic rules (Yer. [[Demai]] ii.23a, [[R.H.]] 34a), one of which—that regulating the sounding of the shofar—has since been universally adopted, and is referred to by medieval Jewish [[casuists]] as &quot;Takkanat R. Abbahu&quot; (the Enactment of R. Abbahu; compare &quot;[[Maḥzor Vitry]]&quot;, Berlin, 1893, p.&amp;nbsp;355). He also visited and taught in many other Jewish towns (Yer. [[Berakhot (Talmud)|Berakhot]]  viii.12a; Yer. [[Shab.]] iii.5c).

While on these journeys, Abbahu gathered so many [[Halakot]] that scholars turned to him for information on mooted questions (Yer. Shabbat viii.11a; Yer. [[Yevamot]] i.2d). In the course of these travels he made a point of complying with all local enactments, even where such compliance laid him open to the charge of inconsistency (Yer. [[Berakhot (Talmud)|Berakhot]]  viii.12a; Yer. [[Beitzah]], i.60d). On the other hand, where circumstances required it, he did not spare even the princes of his people (Yer. [[Avodah Zarah]], i.39b). Where, however, the rigorous exposition of laws worked hardship on the masses, he did not scruple to modify the decisions of his colleagues for the benefit of the community (Shabbat 134b; Yer. Shabbat xvii.16b; Yer. [[Mo'ed Katan]] i.80b). As for himself, he was very strict in the observance of the laws. On one occasion he ordered some [[Samaritan]] wine, but subsequently learning that there were no longer any strict observers of the dietary laws among the Samaritans, with the assistance of his colleagues, [[Ḥiyya b. Abba]], [[Rav Ammi]], and [[Rav Assi]], he investigated the report, and, ascertaining it to be well founded, did not hesitate to declare the Samaritans, for all ritualistic purposes, [[Gentiles]] (Yer. Avodah Zarah, v. 44d; [[Hullin]] 6a).

==Abbahu and Ḥiyya b. Abba==
R. Abbahu's chief characteristic seems to have been modesty. While lecturing in different towns, he met [[R. Ḥiyya b. Abba]], who was lecturing on intricate [[halakic]] themes. As Abbahu delivered popular sermons, the masses naturally crowded to hear him, and deserted the halakist. At this apparent slight, R. Ḥiyya manifested chagrin, and R. Abbahu hastened to comfort him by comparing himself to the pedler of glittering fineries that always attracted the eyes of the masses, while his rival was a trader in precious stones, the virtues and values of which were appreciated only by the connoisseur. This speech not having the desired effect, R. Abbahu showed special respect for his slighted colleague by following him for the remainder of that day. &quot;What,&quot; said Abbahu, &quot;is my modesty as compared with that of R. [[Abba of Acre]] (Acco), who does not even remonstrate with his interpreter for interpolating his own comments in the lecturer's expositions.&quot; When his wife reported to him that his interpreter's wife had boasted of her own husband's greatness, R. Abbahu simply said, &quot;What difference does it make which of us is really the greater, so long as through both of us heaven is glorified?&quot; ([[Sotah]], 40a). His principle of life he expressed in the maxim,

{{quote|Let man ever be of the persecuted, and not of the persecutors; for there are none among the birds more persecuted than turtle-doves and pigeons, and the [[Scriptures]] declare them worthy of the altar.|[[Bava Kamma]] 93a}}

R. Abbahu, though eminent as a halakist, was more distinguished as a [[haggadist]] and controversialist. He had many interesting disputes with the [[Christians]] of his day ([[Shab.]] 152b; [[San.]]  39a; [[Av. Zarah]], 4a). Sometimes these disputes were of a jocular nature. Thus, a heretic bearing the name of Sason (=Joy) once remarked to him, &quot;In the next world your people will have to draw water for me; for thus it is written in the [[Bible]] ([[Isaiah]] 12:3), 'With joy shall ye draw water.'&quot; To this R. Abbahu replied, &quot;Had the Bible said 'for joy' [le-sason], it would mean as thou sayest, but since it says 'with joy' [be-sason], it means that we shall make bottles of thy hide and fill them with water&quot; ([[Suk.]] 48b). These controversies, though forced on him, provoked resentment, and it is even related that his physician, Jacob the Schismatic (Minaah), was slowly poisoning him, but [[R. Ammi]] and [[R. Assi]] discovered the crime in time ([[Av. Zarah]], 28a).

Abbahu had two sons, Zeira and Ḥanina. Some writers ascribe to him a third son, Abimi (Bacher, ''Ag. Pal. Amor.''). Abbahu sent Ḥanina to the academy at [[Tiberias]], where he himself had studied, but the lad occupied himself with the burial of the dead, and on hearing of this, the father sent him a reproachful message in this laconic style: &quot;Is it because there are no graves in Cæsarea (compare [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 14:11) that I have sent thee off to Tiberias? Study must precede practice&quot; ([[Yer.]] [[Pesahim]]  iii.30b). Abbahu left behind him a number of disciples, the most prominent among whom were the leaders of the 4th amoraic generation, [[R. Jonah]] and [[R. Jose]]. At Abbahu's death the mourning was so great that it was said, &quot;Even the statues of [[Cæsarea]] shed tears&quot; ([[Mo'ed Katan]] 25b; Yer. [[Av. Zarah]], iii.42c).

== Other Abbahus ==
There are several other Abbahus mentioned in the [[Talmud]]im and [[Midrashim]], prominent among whom is Abbahu (Abuha, Aibut) b. Ihi (Ittai), a [[Jews of Babylonia|Babylonian]] halakist, contemporary of Samuel and Anan ([[Eruvin]] 74a), and brother of Minyamin (Benjamin) b. Ihi. While this Abbahu repeatedly applied to Samuel for information, Samuel in return learned many Halakot from him ([[Naz.]] 24b; [[Bava Metzia]] 14a, 75a).

== Against the Christians ==
&quot;When does your Messiah come?&quot; a [[Christian]] (Minaah) once asked Abbahu in a tone of mockery, whereupon he replied: &quot;When you will be wrapped in darkness, for it says, 'Behold, darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the nations; then shall the Lord rise upon thee and His glory shall be seen on thee' [ [[Isaiah]] lx.2],&quot; (Sanhedrin  99a). A Christian came to Abbahu with the quibbling question: &quot;How could your God in His priestly holiness bury Moses without providing for purificatory rites, yet oceans are declared insufficient?&quot; (Isaiah 40:12). &quot;Why,&quot; said Abbahu, &quot;does it not say, 'The Lord cometh with fire'?&quot; (Isaiah 64:15). &quot;Fire is the true element of purification, according to [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] xxi.23,&quot; was his answer (Sanhedrin  39a). Another question of the same character: &quot;Why the boastful claim: 'What nation on earth is like Thy people Israel' (II [[Sam.]] 7:23), since we read, 'All the nations are as nothing before Him'?&quot; (Isaiah 40:17), to which Abbahu replied: &quot;Do we not read of Israel, he 'shall not be reckoned among the nations'?&quot; (Numbers xxiii. 9, Sanhedrin  as above). 

Abbahu made a notable exception with reference to the [[Tosefta]]'s statement that the Gilionim (Evangels) and other books of the Mineans are not to be saved from a conflagration on [[Shabbat|Sabbath]]: &quot;the books of those at Abidan may be saved&quot; ([[Shab.]] 116a). Of special historical interest is the observation of Abbahu in regard to the benediction &quot;Baruk Shem Kebod Malkuto&quot; (Blessed be the Name of His glorious Kingdom) after the &quot;Shema' Yisrael,&quot; that in Palestine, where the Christians look for points of controversy, the words should be recited aloud (lest the Jews be accused of tampering with the unity of God proclaimed in the Shema'), whereas in the Babylonian city of [[Nehardea]], where there are no Christians, the words are recited with a low voice ([[Pesahim]]  56a). Preaching directly against the Christian dogma, Abbahu says: &quot;A king of flesh and blood may have a father, a brother, or a son to share in or dispute his sovereignty, but the Lord saith, 'I am the Lord thy God! I am the first; that is, I have no father, and I am the last; that is, I have no brother, and besides me there is no God; that is, I have no son'&quot; ([[Isaiah]] 44:6; [[Ex. R.]] 29). His comment on Numbers 23:19 has a still more polemical tone: &quot;God is not a man that he should lie; neither the son of man, that he should repent. If a man say, 'I am God,' he lieth, and if he say, 'I am the son of man,' he will have to repent, and if he say, 'I shall go up to heaven,' he will not do it, nor achieve what he promises&quot; ([[Yer.]] [[Ta'anit]], ii.65b).

Some of his controversies on Christian theological subjects, as on [[Adam (Bible)|Adam]] ([[Yalḳ.]], Gen. 47), on [[Enoch (ancestor of Noah)|Enoch]] ([[Gen. R.]] 25), and on the resurrection ([[Shab.]] 152b), are less clear and direct (see Bacher, ''Ag. Pal. Amor.'' ii.97, 115-118).

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Abbreviator''', plural '''Abbreviators''' in English or '''Abbreviatores''' in Latin, also called '''Breviators''', were a body of writers in the papal [[Apostolic Chancery|chancery]], whose business was to sketch out and prepare in due form the [[papal bull|pope's bulls]], [[Papal brief|briefs]] and [[consistory|consistorial]] decrees before these are written out ''in extenso'' by the ''scriptores''.

They are first mentioned in the [[papal bull]]s ''[[Extravagantes]]'' of [[Pope John XXII]] and of [[Pope Benedict XII]]. 

After the [[protonotary|protonotaries]] left the sketching of the minutes to the abbreviators, those ''de Parco majori'', who ranked as [[prelate]]s, were the most important officers of the apostolic chancery. By the time of [[Pope Martin V]] their signature was made essential to the validity of the acts of the chancery; and they obtained in course of time many important privileges.
== Roman lay origin ==
Abbreviators are those who make an abridgment or abstract of a long writing or discourse by contracting the parts, i.e. the words and sentences; an abbreviated form of writing common among the Romans. Abbreviations were of two kinds: the use of a single letter for a single word, 
the use of a sign, note, or mark for a word or phrase. 
The [[Emperor Justinian]] forbade the use of abbreviations in the compilation of the &quot;Digest&quot; and afterwards extended his prohibition to all other writings. This prohibition was not universally obeyed. The abbreviators found it to their own convenience and interest to use the abbreviated form, and especially was this the case at Rome. The early Christians practised the abbreviated mode, no doubt as an easy and safe way of communicating with one another and safeguarding their secrets from enemies and false brethren. 

== Ecclesiastical abbreviatores ==
In course of time the Apostolic Chancery adopted this mode of writing as the &quot;curial&quot; style, still further abridging by omitting the [[diphthong]]s ''ae'' and ''oe'', and likewise all lines and marks of punctuation. The ecclesiastical Abbreviators were officials of the Holy See, among the principal officials of the [[Apostolic Chancery]], which is one of the oldest and most important offices in the Roman Curia. 

The scope of its labour, as well as the number of its officials, has varied with the times. Up to the twelfth or thirteenth century, the duty of the Apostolic - or [[Roman Chancery]] was to prepare and expedite the pontifical letters and writs for collation of church dignities and other matters of grave importance which were discussed and decided in [[Consistory]]. About the thirteenth or fourteenth century, the popes, then residing at [[Avignon]] in France, began to reserve the collation of a great many [[benefice]]s, so that all the benefices, especially the greater ones, were to be conferred through the Roman Curia (Lega, Praelectiones Jur. Can., I, ii, 287). As a consequence, the labour was immensely augmented, and the number of Abbreviators necessarily increased. To regulate the proper expedition of these reserved benefices, [[Pope John XXII]] instituted the rules of chancery to determine the competency and mode of procedure of the Chancery. Afterwards the establishment of the [[Dataria]] and the [[Secretariate of Briefs]] lightened the work of the Chancery and led to a reduction in the number of Abbreviators. 

According to Ciampini (Lib. de Abbreviatorum de parco majore etc., cap. i) the institution of curial abbreviators was very ancient, succeeding after the persecutions to the notaries who recorded the acts of the martyrs. Other authors reject this early institution and ascribe it to [[Pope John XXII]] (1316). It is certain that he uses the name Abbreviators, but speaks as if they had existed before his time, and had, by overtaxation for their labour, caused much complaint and protest. He (Extravag. Joan. tit. xiii, &quot;Cum ad Sacrosanctae Romanae Ecclesiae&quot;) prescribes their work, determines how much they may charge for their labour, fixes a certain tax for an abstract or abridgment of twenty-five words, or their equivalent, 150 letters, forbids them to charge more, even though the abstract goes over twenty-five words but less than fifty words, enacts that the basis of the tax is the labour employed in writing, expediting, etc., the Bulls, and by no means the emoluments accruing to the recipient of the favour or benefice conferred by the Bull, and declares that whoever shall charge more than the tax fixed by him shall be suspended for six months from office, and upon a second violation of the law, shall be deprived of it altogether, and if the delinquent be an abbreviator, he shall be excommunicated. Should a large letter have to be rewritten, owing to the inexact copy of the abbreviator, the abbreviator and not the receiver of the Bull must pay the extra charge for the extra labour to the apostolic writer. 

Whatever may be the date of the institution of the office of abbreviator, it is certain that it became of greater importance and more highly privileged upon its erection into a college of prelates. [[Pope Martin V]] (Constit. 3 &quot;In Apostolicae&quot;, ii and v) fixed the manner for their examination and approbation and also the tax they should demand for their labour and the punishment for overcharge. He also assigned to them certain emoluments. The Abbreviators of the lower, or lesser, were to be promoted to the higher, or greater, bar or presidency. Their offices were compatible with other offices, i.e. they can hold two benefices or offices at one and the same time, some conferred by the Cardinal Vice-Chancellor, others by the Holy Father.

== Erection into a college of Prelates ==
In the pontificate of [[Pius II]], their number, which had been fixed at twenty-four, had overgrown to such an extent as to diminish considerably the individual remuneration, and, as a consequence, able and competent men no longer sought the office, and hence the old style of writing and expediting the Bulls was no longer used, to the great injury of justice, the interested parties, and the dignity of the Holy See. To remedy this and to restore the old established chancery style, the Pope selected out of the many then living Abbreviators seventy, and formed them into a college of prelates, and decreed that their office should be perpetual, that certain emoluments should be attached to it, and granted certain privileges to the possessors of the same. He ordained further that some should be called &quot;Abbreviators of the Upper Bar&quot; (''Abbreviatores de Parco Majori''; the name derived from a space in the chancery, surrounded by a grating, in which the officials sat, which is called higher or lower (major or minor) according to the proximity of the seats to that of the vice-[[chancellor]]), the others of the Lower Bar (''Abbreviatores de Parco Minori''); that the former should sit upon a slightly raised portion of the chamber, separated from the rest of the hall or chamber by lattice work, assist the [[Cardinal Vice-Chancellor]], subscribe the letters and have the principal part in examining, revising, and expediting the apostolic letters to be issued with the leaden seal; that the latter, however, should sit among the apostolic writers upon benches in the lower part of the chamber, and their duty was to carry the signed schedules or supplications to the prelates of the upper bar. Then one of the prelates of the upper bar made an abstract, and another prelate of the same bar revised it. Prelates of the upper bar formed a quasi-tribunal, in which as a college they decided all doubts that might arise about the form and quality of the letters, of the clauses and decrees to be adjoined to the apostolic letters, and sometimes about the payment of the emoluments and other contingencies. Their opinion about questions concerning chancery business was held in the highest estimation by all the Roman tribunals. 

[[Pope Paul II]] suppressed this college; but [[Sixtus IV]] (Constitutio 16, &quot;Divina&quot;) reestablished it. He appointed seventy-two abbreviators, of whom twelve were of the upper, or greater, and twenty-two of the lower, or lesser, presidency (Parco), and thirty-eight examiners on first appearance of letters. They were bound to be in attendance on certain days under penalty of fine, and sign letters and diplomas. Ciampini mentions a decree of the Vice-Chancellor by which absentees were mulcted in the loss of their share of the emoluments of the following chancery session. The same Pope also granted many privileges to the College of Abbreviators, but especially to the members of the greater presidency. 

[[Pius VII]] suppressed many of the chancery offices, and so the [[Tribunal of Correctors]] and the Abbreviators of the lower presidency disappeared. Of the Tribunal of Correctors, a [[substitute-corrector]] alone remains. Bouix (Curia Romana, edit. 1859) chronicles the suppression of the lower presidency and puts the number of Abbreviators at that date at eleven. The present college consists of seventeen prelates, six substitutes, and one sub-substitute, all of whom, except the prelates, may be clerics or laymen. Although the duty of Abbreviators was originally to make abstracts and abridgments of the apostolic letters, diplomas, etc., using the legal abbreviations, clauses, and [[Formulary (model documents)|formularies]], in course of time, as their office grew in importance they delegated that part of their office to their substitute and confined themselves to overseeing the proper expedition of the apostolic letters. Prior to the year 1878, all apostolic letters and briefs requiring for their validity the leaden seal were engrossed upon rough parchment and in Gothic characters (round letters, also called Gallicum and commonly Bollatico, but in Italy today Teutonic) without lines, or diphthongs, or marks of punctuation. Bulls engrossed on a different parchment, or in different characters with lines and punctuation marks, or without the accustomed abbreviations, clauses, and formularies, would be rejected as spurious. Pope Leo XIII (Constitutio Universae Eccles., 29 December 1878) ordained that they should be written henceforth in ordinary Latin characters upon ordinary parchment, and that no abbreviations should be used except those easily understood. 

== Titles and privileges ==
Many great privileges were conferred upon Abbreviators in the past. By decree of [[pope Leo X]] they were created papal nobles, ranking as [[Comes palatinus]] ('Count Palatine'), [[wikt:familiar|familiar]]s and members of the papal household, so that they might enjoy all the privileges of [[domestic prelate]]s and of prelates in actual attendance on the Pope, as regards plurality of benefices as well as expectives. They and their clerics and their properties were exempt from all jurisdiction except the immediate jurisdiction of the Pope, and they were not subject to the judgments of the [[Auditor of Causes]], or to the [[Cardinal Vicar]]. He also empowered them to confer (later within strict limitations) the degree of Doctor, with all university privileges, create notaries (later abrogated), legitimize children so as to make them eligible to receive benefices vacated by their fathers (now revoked), also to ennoble three persons and to make Knights of the [[Order of St. Sylvester]] (Militiae Aureae), the same to enjoy and to wear the insignia of nobility. Pope Gregory XVI rescinded this privilege and reserved to the Pope the right of creation of such knights (Acta Pont. Greg. XVI, Vol. III, 178-179-180). 

[[Pope Paul V]], who in early manhood was a member of the College (Const. 2, &quot;Romani&quot;), made them [[Referendaries of Favours]], and after three years of service, [[Referendaries of Justice]], enjoying the privileges of Referendaries and permitting one to assist in the signatures before the Pope, giving all a right to a portion in the papal palace and exempting them from the registration of favours as required by [[Pius IV]] (Const., 98) with regard to matters pertaining to the [[Apostolic Chamber]]. 

They followed immediately after the twelve voting members of the Signature in capella. Abbreviators of the greater presidency were permitted to wear the purple cassock and cappa, as also [[rochet]] in capella. Abbreviators of the lower presidency before their suppression were simple clerics, and according to permission granted by [[Sixtus IV]] (loc. cit.) might be even married men. 

These offices becoming vacant by death of the Abbreviator, no matter where the death take place, are reserved in Curia. The prelates could resign their office in favour of others. Formerly these offices as well as those of the other chancery officers from the Regent down were occasions of venality, until popes, especially [[Benedict XIV]] and [[Pius VII]], gradually abolish that. [[Pope Leo XIII]] (Motu Proprio, 4 July 1898) most solemnly decreed the abolition of all venality in the transfer or Collation of the said offices. 

As domestic prelates, prelates of the Roman Court, they had personal preeminence in every diocese of the world. They were addressed as &quot;Reverendissimus&quot;, &quot;Right Reverend&quot;, and &quot;Monsignor&quot;. As prelates, and therefore possessing the legal dignity, they were competent to receive and execute papal commands. [[Benedict XIV]] (Const. 3, &quot;Maximo&quot;) granted prelates of the greater presidency the privilege of wearing a hat with purple band, which right they hold even after they have ceased to be abbreviators. 

== Suppression ==
The college was suppressed in 1908 by [[Pope Pius X]] and their duties were transferred to the ''[[protonotarius apostolicus participans|protonotarii apostolici participantes]]''. (See [[Curia Romana]])

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Muwaffaq al-Din Muhammad 'Abd al-Latif ibn Yusuf al-Baghdadi''' ({{lang-ar| موفق الدين محمد عبد اللطيف بن يوسف البغدادي}}; 1162–1231), more commonly known as ''''Abd al-Latif al-Baghdadi''' or ''''Abdallatif al-Baghdadi''' ({{lang-ar|عبداللطيف البغدادي}}), born in [[Baghdad]], [[Iraq]], was a celebrated [[Islamic medicine|physician]], [[Historiography of early Islam|historian]], [[Egyptologist]] and traveller, and one of the most voluminous writers of the [[Near East]] in his time.&lt;ref&gt;[[Chambers Biographical Dictionary]], ISBN 0-550-18022-2, page 3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
An interesting memoir of Abdallatif, written by himself, has been preserved with additions by Ibn Abu-Osaiba (Ibn abi Usaibia), a contemporary. From that work we learn that the higher education of the youth of Baghdad consisted principally in a minute and careful study of the rules and principles of [[grammar]], and in their committing to memory the whole of the ''[[Qur'an]]'', a treatise or two on [[philology]] and [[jurisprudence]], and the choicest Arabic poetry.

After attaining to great proficiency in that kind of learning, Abdallatif applied himself to [[natural philosophy]] and [[medicine]]. To enjoy the society of the learned, he went first to [[Mosul]] (1189), and afterwards to [[Damascus]]. With letters of recommendation from [[Saladin]]'s [[vizier]], he visited [[Egypt]], where he realized his wish to converse with [[Maimonides]].

He afterwards formed one of the circles of learned men whom Saladin gathered around him at [[Jerusalem]]. He taught medicine and [[philosophy]] at [[Cairo]] and at Damascus for a number of years, and afterwards, for a shorter period, at [[Aleppo]].

His love of travel led him to visit different parts of [[Armenia]] and [[Asia Minor]] in his old age. Also, he was in the process of setting out on a [[hajj|pilgrimage]] to [[Mecca]] when he died at Baghdad.

==''Account of Egypt''==
{{see also|Sociology in medieval Islam}}

Abdallatif was undoubtedly a man of great knowledge and of an inquisitive and penetrating mind. Of the numerous works (mostly on medicine) which Osaiba ascribes to him, one only, his graphic and detailed ''Account of Egypt'' (in two parts), appears to be known in [[Europe]].

===Archeology===
Abd-al Latif was well aware of the value of ancient monuments and praised Muslim rulers for preserving and protecting pre-Islamic artifacts and monuments. He noted that the preservation of antiquities presented a number of benefits for Muslims:&lt;ref name=Daly-10&gt;{{citation|title=Egyptology: The Missing Millennium : Ancient Egypt in Medieval Arabic Writings|first=Okasha|last=El Daly|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=2004|isbn=1-84472-063-2|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*&quot;monuments are useful historical evidence for chronologies;&quot;
*&quot;they furnish evidence for Holy Scriptures, since the Qur'an mentions them and their people;&quot;
*&quot;they are reminders of human endurance and fate;&quot;
*&quot;they show, to a degree, the politics and history of ancestors, the richness of their sciences, and the genius of their thought.&quot;

While discussing the profession of [[treasure hunting]], he notes that poorer treasure hunters were often sponsored by rich businessmen to go on [[Archeology|archeological]] expeditions. In some cases, an expedition could turn out to be [[fraud]], with the treasure hunter disappearing with large amounts of money extracted from sponsors. This fraudulent practice continues to the present day, with rich businessmen in Egypt still being deceived by local treasure hunters.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Egyptology: The Missing Millennium : Ancient Egypt in Medieval Arabic Writings|first=Okasha|last=El Daly|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=2004|isbn=1-84472-063-2|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Egyptology===
This work was one of the earliest works on [[Egyptology]]. It contains a vivid description of a [[famine]] caused, during the author's residence in Egypt, by the [[Nile]] failing to overflow its banks. He also wrote detailed descriptions on [[Ancient Egyptian architecture|ancient Egyptian monuments]].&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Okasha El Daly (2005), ''Egyptology: The Missing Millennium: Ancient Egypt in Medieval Arabic Writings'', [[University College London|UCL Press]], ISBN 1-84472-063-2. ([[cf.]] [http://www.muslimheritage.com/topics/default.cfm?ArticleID=481 Arabic Study of Ancient Egypt], Foundation for Science Technology and Civilisation.)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Autopsy===
Al-Baghdadi wrote that during the famine in Egypt in 597 AH (1200 AD), he had the opportunity to [[observe]] and [[examine]] a large number of [[skeleton]]s. This was one of the earliest examples of a postmortem [[autopsy]], through which he discovered that [[Galen]] was incorrect regarding the formation of the [[bone]]s of the lower [[jaw]] and [[sacrum]].&lt;ref&gt;Emilie Savage-Smith (1996), &quot;Medicine&quot;, in Roshdi Rashed, ed., ''[[Encyclopedia of the History of Arabic Science]]'', Vol. 3, p. 903–962 [951]. [[Routledge]], London and New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Translation===
The Arabic manuscript was discovered in 1665 by [[Edward Pococke]] the [[oriental studies|orientalist]], and preserved in the [[Bodleian Library]]. He then published the Arabic manuscript in the 1680s. His son, Edward Pococke the Younger, translated the work into [[Latin]], though he was only able to publish less than half of his work. Thomas Hunt attempted to publish Pococke's complete translation in 1746, though his attempt was unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;[[G. J. Toomer]] (1996), ''Eastern Wisedome and Learning: The Study of Arabic in Seventeenth-Century England'', pp. 272-273, [[Oxford University Press]], ISBN 0-19-820291-1.&lt;/ref&gt; Pococke's complete Latin translation was eventually published by [[Joseph White (professor)|Joseph White]] of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] in 1800. The work was then translated into [[French language|French]], with valuable notes, by [[Silvestre de Sacy]] in 1810.&lt;ref&gt;[[G. J. Toomer]] (1996), ''Eastern Wisedome and Learning: The Study of Arabic in Seventeenth-Century England'', p. 275, [[Oxford University Press]], ISBN 0-19-820291-1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical works==
===''Al-Mukhtarat fi al-Tibb''===
Al-Baghdadi's ''Mukhtarat fi al-Tibb'' was one of the earliest works on [[hirudotherapy]]. He introduced a more modern use for [[medicinal leech]], stating that leech could be used for cleaning the [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]] after [[Surgery|surgical]] operations. He did, however, understand that there is a risk over using [[leech]], and advised patients that leech need to be cleaned before being used and that the dirt or dust &quot;clinging to a leech should be wiped off&quot; before application. He further writes that after the leech has sucked out the blood, [[salt]] should be &quot;sprinkled on the affected part of the human body.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Nurdeen Deuraseh, &quot;Ahadith of the Prophet on Healing in Three Things (al-Shifa’ fi Thalatha): An Interpretational&quot;, ''Journal of the International Society for the History of Islamic Medicine'', 2004 (3): 14–20 [18].&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Medicine from the Book and the Life of the Prophet''===
He wrote a book called ''Al-Tibb min al-Kitab wa-al-Sunna'' (''Medicine from the Book and the Life of the Prophet'') describing the [[Islamic medicine|Islamic medical]] practices from the time of [[Muhammad]].&lt;ref name=Prophet&gt;[http://tabsir.net/?p=211 The Prophet’s Medicine: Part One]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diabetes===
Al-Baghdadi was also the author of a major book dealing with [[diabetes]].&lt;ref name=Prophet/&gt;

'''Abd al-Rahman I''', or, his full name by patronymic record,  '''Abd al-Rahman ibn Mu'awiya ibn Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan''' (Arabic: عبد الرحمن الداخل; 731 – 788) was the founder of the [[Umayyad]] Emirate of [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]] (755),&lt;ref&gt;''[[Chambers Biographical Dictionary]]'', ISBN 0-550-18022-2, page 2&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Muslim]] dynasty that ruled the greater part of [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]] for nearly three centuries (including the succeeding [[Caliphate of Córdoba]]). The Muslims called the regions of Iberia under their dominion [[al-Andalus]].   Abd al-Rahman's establishment of a government in al-Andalus represented a branching from the rest of the [[Muslim conquests|Islamic Empire]], which had been usurped by the [[Abbasid]] overthrow of the Umayyads from [[Damascus, Syria|Damascus]] in 750.

He was also known by appelations ''al-Dakhil'' (&quot;the Immigrant&quot;), ''Saqr Quraish'' (&quot;the Falcon of the [[Quraysh (tribe)|Quraysh]]&quot;)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.idir.net/~suede/successor1.html Abd ar-Rahman I&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and the &quot;Falcon of Andalus&quot;. Variations of the spelling of his name include '''Abd ar-Rahman I''', '''Abdul Rahman I''' and '''Abderraman I'''.

==Biography==
===Flight from Damascus===
Born near [[Damascus]] in Syria, Abd al-Rahman, grandson of [[Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik]], was the son of the Umayyad prince [[Mu'awiyah ibn Hisham]] and a [[Berber people|Berber]] concubine.&lt;ref&gt;Peter C. Scales, ''The fall of the caliphate of Córdoba: Berbers and Andalusis in conflict'', Bril, 1994, p.111&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Arnold Joseph Toynbee]], ''A study of history'',  Oxford University Press, H. Milford, 1934, Volume 8, p.372''&lt;/ref&gt; He was twenty when his family, the ruling [[Umayyads]], were overthrown by a popular revolt known as the [[Abbasid Caliphate#Rise|Abbasid Revolution]], occurring in the year 750. Abd al-Rahman and a small selection of his family fled [[Damascus]], where the center of Umayyad power had been; people moving with him include his brother Yahiya, his four-year old son Sulayman, and some of his sisters, as well as his former Greek slave (a freedman), Bedr. The family fled from Damascus to the River [[Euphrates]]. All along the way the path was filled with danger, as the [[Abbasids]] had dispatched horsemen across the region to try and find the Umayyad prince and kill him. The Abbasids were merciless with all Umayyads that they found. Abbasid agents closed in on Abd al-Rahman and his family while they were hiding in a small village. He left his young son with his sisters and fled with [[Yahiya]]. Accounts vary, but Bedr likely initially escaped with Abd ar-Rahman. Some histories indicate that Bedr met up with Abd al-Rahman at a later date.&lt;ref&gt;Ahmed ibn Muhammad al-Maqqari. ''The History of the Mohammedan Dynasties in Spain'', 96. It should be noted that al-Maqqari quotes from historian [[Ibn Hayyan]]'s ''Muktabis'' when detailing Abd al-Rahman's flight from Syria.&lt;/ref&gt;

Abd al-Rahman, Yahiya and Bedr quit the village narrowly escaping the Abbasid assassins. Later, on the way south, Abbasid horsemen again caught up with the trio: Abd al-Rahman and his companions then threw themselves into the River Euphrates. While trying to swim across the dangerous Euphrates, Abd al-Rahman is said to have become separated from his brother Yahiya, who began swimming back towards the horsemen, possibly from fear of drowning. The horsemen beseeched the escapees to return, and that no harm would come to them. 17th century historian [[Ahmed Mohammed al-Maqqari]] poignantly described Abd al-Rahman's reaction as he implored Yahiya to keep going: &quot;O brother! Come to me, come to me&quot;!&lt;ref&gt;Ahmed ibn Muhammad al-Maqqari. ''The History of the Mohammedan Dynasties in Spain'', p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; Yahiya returned to the near shore, and was quickly dispatched by the horsemen. They cut the head off their prize, leaving Yahiya's body to rot. Al-Maqqari quotes prior [[Muslim historians]] as having recorded that Abd al-Rahman said he was so overcome with fear at that moment, that once he made the far shore he ran until exhaustion overcame him.&lt;ref&gt;Ahmed ibn Muhammad al-Maqqari, ''The History of the Mohammedan Dynasties in Spain'', p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; Only he and Bedr were left to face the unknown.

===Exile years===
After barely escaping with their lives, Abd al-Rahman and Bedr continued south through [[Palestine]], the [[Sinai]], and then into [[Egypt]]. Abd al-Rahman had to keep a low profile as he traveled. It may be assumed that he intended to go at least as far as northwestern Africa ([[Maghreb]]), the land of his mother, which had been partly conquered by his Umayyad predecessors. The journey across Egypt would prove perilous. At the time, [[Abd al-Rahman ibn Habib al-Fihri]] was the semi-autonomous governor of [[Ifriqiya]] (roughly, modern Tunisia) and a former Umayyad client.  The ambitious Ibn Habib, a member of the illustrious [[Fihrid]] family, had long sought to carve out Ifriqiya as a private dominion for himself.  At first, he sought an understanding with the Abbasids, but when they refused his terms and demanded his submission, Ibn Habib broke openly with the Abbasids and invited the remnants of the Umayyad dynasty to take refuge in his dominions.  Abd al-Rahman was only one of several surviving Umayyad family members to make their way to Ifriqiya at this time.

But Ibn Habib soon changed his mind.  He feared the presence of prominent Umayyad exiles in Ifriqiya, a family more illustrious than his own, might become a focal point for intrigue among local nobles against his own usurped powers.  Around 755, believing he had discovered plots involving some of the more prominent Umayyad exiles in Kairouan, Ibn Habib turned against them.  At the time, Abd al-Rahman and Bedr were keeping a low profile, staying in [[Kabylia]], at the camp of a Nafza Berber chieftain friendly to their plight.  Ibn Habib dispatched spies to look for the wayward Umayyad prince. When Ibn Habib's soldiers entered the camp, the Berber chieftain’s wife Tekfah hid Abd al-Rahman under her personal belongings to help him go unnoticed.&lt;ref&gt;Ahmed ibn Muhammad al-Maqqari, ''The History of the Mohammedan Dynasties in Spain''. Again al-Maqqari cited [[Ibn Hayyan]] for the vast majority of the preceding information, 58–61.&lt;/ref&gt;  Once they were gone, Abd a-Rahman and Bedr immediately set off westwards.

In 755, Abd al-Rahman and Bedr reached modern day Morocco near [[Ceuta]]. Next step would be to cross to sea to [[al-Andalus]], where Abd al-Rahman could not have been sure if he would be welcomed or not in that far-flung province of the empire. Following the [[Berber Revolt]] of the 740s, the province was in a state of confusion, with the [[Ummah|Muslim community]] torn by tribal dissensions among the [[Arab]]s and racial tensions between the Arabs and Berbers.  At that moment, the nominal ruler of al-Andalus, emir [[Yusuf ibn 'Abd al-Rahman al-Fihri]] (another member of the [[Fihrid]] family, and a favorite of the old Arab settlers (''baladiyun''), mostly of south Arabian or '[[Yemen]]ite' tribal stock) was locked in a contest with his vizier (and son-in-law) [[al-Sumayl ibn Hatim al-Qilabi]], the head of the new settlers (''shamiyum'', the Syrian ''[[Greater Syria#Historic Syria|junds]]'' or military regiments, mostly of north Arabian [[Qais|Qaysid]] tribes, which had arrived only in 742).&lt;ref name=Kennedy&gt;H. Kennedy (1996) ''Muslim Spain and Portugal: a political history of al-Andalus''. London: Longman.&lt;/ref&gt;   

Among the Syrian junds were contingents of old Umayyad clients, numbering perhaps 500,&lt;ref name=Kennedy/&gt; and Abd al-Rahman believed he might tug on old loyalties and get them to receive him. Bedr was dispatched across the straits to make contact.  Bedr managed to line up three Syrian commanders – Obeid Allah ibn Uthman and Abd Allah ibn Khalid, both originally of Damascus, and Yusuf ibn Bukht of Qinnasrin.&lt;ref name=Kennedy/&gt;  The trio approached the Syrian arch-commander al-Sumayl (then in [[Zaragoza]]) to get his consent, but al-Sumayl refused, fearing Abd al-Rahman would try to make himself emir.&lt;ref name=Kennedy/&gt;  As a result, Bedr and the Umayyad clients sent out feelers to their rivals, the Yemenite commanders. Although the Yemenites were not natural allies (the Umayyads are a Qaysid tribe), their interest was piqued.  The emir Yusuf al-Fihri, had proven himself unable to keep the powerful al-Sumayl in check and several Yemenite chieftans felt their future prospects were poor, whether in a Fihrid or Syrian-dominated Spain, that they had a better chance of advancement if they hitched themselves to the glitter of the Umayyad name.&lt;ref name=Kennedy/&gt;  Although the Umayyads did not have a historical presence in the region (no member of the Umayyad family was known to have ever set foot in al-Andalus before) and there were grave concerns about young Abd al-Rahman's inexperience, several of the lower-ranking Yemenite commanders felt they had little to lose and much to gain, and agreed to support the prince.&lt;ref name=Kennedy/&gt;

Bedr made haste to return to Africa, bringing the invitation of the Umayyad clients.  Abd al-Rahman was told to go to al-Andalus. Shortly thereafter, he  set off with Bedr and a small group of followers for Europe. When some local Berber tribesmen learned of Abd al-Rahman's intent to set sail for al-Andalus, they quickly rode to catch up with him on the coast. The tribesmen might have figured that they could hold Abd al-Rahman as hostage, and force him to buy his way out of Africa. He did indeed have to hand over some amount of dinars to the suddenly hostile local Berbers. Just as Abd al-Rahman launched his boat yet another group of Berbers arrived, also with the intent of making him pay a fee for leaving. One of the Berbers held on to Abd al-Rahman's vessel as it made for al-Andalus, and allegedly had his hand cut off by one of the boat's crew.&lt;ref&gt;Ahmed ibn Muhammad al-Maqqari, ''The History of the Mohammedan Dynasties in Spain''. pp. 65–68.&lt;/ref&gt;

Abd al-Rahman landed at [[Almuñécar]] in al-Andalus, to the east of [[Málaga]], in September 755; however his landing site was unconfirmed.

===Fight for power===
Upon landing in al-Andalus, Abd al-Rahman was greeted by clients Abu Uthman and Ibn Khalid and an escort of 300 cavalry.&lt;ref name=Kennedy/&gt; During his brief time in Málaga, he was able to amass local support quickly. Waves of people made their way to Málaga to pay respect to the prince they thought was dead, including many of the aforementioned Syrians. One famous story which persisted through history related to a gift Abd al-Rahman was given while in Málaga. The gift was a beautiful young slave girl, but Abd al-Rahman humbly returned her to her previous master.

News of the prince's arrival spread like wildfire throughout the peninsula. During this time, emir al-Fihri and the Syrian commander al-Sumayl, pondered what to do about the new threat to their shaky hold on power. They decided to try to marry Abd al-Rahman into their family. If that did not work, then Abd al-Rahman would have to be killed. Abd al-Rahman was apparently sagacious enough to expect such a plot. In order to help speed his ascension to power, he was prepared to take advantage of the feuds and dissensions.  However, before anything could be done, trouble broke out in northern al-Andalus. [[Zaragoza#Arab Saraqusta|Zaragoza]], an important trade city on the Upper March of al-Andalus, made a bid for autonomy. Al-Fihri and al-Sumayl rode north to squash the rebellion. This might have been fortunate timing for Abd al-Rahman, since he was still getting a solid foothold in al-Andalus. By March of 756, Abd al-Rahman and his growing following of Umayyad clients and Yemenite junds, were able to take Sevilla without violence. After settling his bloody business in Zaragoza, al-Fihri turned his army back south to face the &quot;pretender&quot;. The fight for the right to rule al-Andalus was about to begin. The two contingents met on opposite sides of the River Guadalquivir, just outside the capital of [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]] on the plains of Musarah.

The river was, for the first time in years, overflowing its banks, heralding the end of a long drought. Nevertheless, food was still scarce, and Abd al-Rahman's army suffered from hunger. In an attempt to demoralize Abd al-Rahman's troops, al-Fihri ensured that his troops not only were well fed, but also ate gluttonous amounts of food in full view of the Umayyad lines. An attempt at negotiations soon followed in which it is likely that Abd al-Rahman was offered the hand of al-Fihri's daughter in marriage and great wealth. Abd ar-Rahman, however, would settle for nothing less than control of the emirate, and an impasse was reached. Even before the fight began, dissension spread through some of Abd al-Rahman's lines. Specifically, the Yemeni Arabs were unhappy that the prince was mounted on a fine Spanish steed. And the prince's mettle was untried in battle, after all! The Yemenis observed significantly that such a fine horse would provide an excellent mount to escape from battle. 

Being the ever-wary politician, Abd al-Rahman acted quickly to regain Yemeni support, and rode to a Yemeni chief who was mounted on a mule named &quot;Lightning&quot;. Abd al-Rahman averred that his horse proved difficult to ride and was wont to buck him out of the saddle. He offered to exchange his horse for the mule, a deal to which the surprised chief readily agreed. The swap quelled the simmering Yemeni rebellion. Soon both armies were in their lines on the same bank of the Guadalquivir. Abd al-Rahman had no banner, and so one was improvised by unwinding a green turban and binding it round the head of a spear. Subsequently the turban and the spear became the banner and symbol of the Andalusian Umayyads. Abd al-Rahman led the charge toward al-Fihri's army. Al-Sumayl in turn advanced his cavalry out to meet the Umayyad threat. After a long and difficult fight “Abd ar-Rahman obtained a most complete victory, and the field was strewn with the bodies of the enemy”.&lt;ref&gt;[[Philip Khuri Hitti|Philip K. Hitti]]. ''Makers of Arab History''. (New York. St Martin’s Press), 1968. p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; Both al-Fihri and al-Sumayl managed to escape the field (probably) with parts of the army too. Abd al-Rahman triumphantly marched into the capital, Córdoba. Danger was not far behind, as al-Fihri planned a [[counterattack]]. He reorganized his forces and set out for the capital Abd al-Rahman had usurped from him. Again Abd al-Rahman met al-Fihri with his army; this time negotiations were successful, although the terms were somewhat changed. In exchange for al-Fihri's life and wealth, he would be a prisoner and not allowed to leave the city limits of Córdoba. Al-Fihri would have to report once a day to Abd al-Rahman, as well as turn over some of his sons and daughters as hostages. For a while al-Fihri met the obligations of the one-sided truce, but he still had many people loyal to him; people who would have liked to see him back in power.

Al-Fihri eventually did make another bid for power. He quit Córdoba and quickly started gathering supporters. While at large, al-Fihri managed to gather an army allegedly numbering to 20,000. It is doubtful, however, that his troops were &quot;regular&quot; soldiers, but rather a [[Hodge-Podge|hodge-podge]] of men from various parts of al-Andalus. Abd ar-Rahman's appointed governor in Sevilla took up the chase, and after a series of small fights, managed to defeat al-Fihri's army. Al-Fihri himself managed to escape to the former Visigoth capital of [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] in central al-Andalus; once there, he was promptly killed. Al-Fihri's head was sent to Córdoba, where Abd al-Rahman had it nailed to a bridge. With this act, Abd ar-Rahman proclaimed himself the emir of al-Andalus. One final act had to be performed, however: al-Fihri's general, al-Sumayl, had to be dealt with, and he was garroted in Córdoba's jail.

===Rule===
Indeed, Abd al-Rahman only proclaimed himself as emir, and not as caliph. This was likely because al-Andalus was a land besieged by many different loyalties, and the proclamation of caliph would have likely caused much unrest. Abd al-Rahman's progeny would, however, take up the title of caliph. In the meantime, a call went out through the Muslim world that al-Andalus was a [[safe haven]] for friends of the house of Umayya, if not for Abd al-Rahman's scattered family that managed to evade the Abbasids. Abd al-Rahman probably was quite happy to see his call answered by waves of Umayyad faithful and family. He was finally reacquainted with his son Sulayman, whom he last saw weeping on the banks of the Euphrates with his sisters. Abd ar-Rahman's sisters were unable to make the long voyage to al-Andalus. Abd al-Rahman placed his family members in high offices across the land, doubtless that he felt he could trust them more than non-family. The Umayyad family would again grow large and prosperous over successive generations. However, by 763 Abd ar-Rahman had to get back to the business of war. Al-Andalus had been invaded by an Abbasid army.

Far away in [[Baghdad]], the current Abbasid caliph, [[al-Mansur]], had long been planning to depose the Umayyad who dared to call himself emir of al-Andalus. Al-Mansur installed [[al-Ala]] ibn-Mugith (also known as al-Ala) as governor of Africa (whose title gave him dominion over the province of al-Andalus). It was al-Ala who headed the Abbasid army that landed in al-Andalus, possibly near [[Beja (Portugal)|Beja]] (in modern day [[Portugal]]). Much of the surrounding area of Beja capitulated to al-Ala, and in fact rallied under the Abbasid banners against Abd al-Rahman. Abd al-Rahman had to act quickly. The Abbasid contingent was vastly superior in size, said to have numbered 7,000 men. The emir quickly made for the redoubt of Carmona with his army. The Abbasid army was fast on his heels, and laid siege to Carmona for approximately two months. Abd al-Rahman must have sensed that time was against him as food and water became scarce, and his troops morale likely came into question. Finally Abd al-Rahman gathered his men as he was &quot;resolved on an audacious sally&quot; [15]. Abd al-Rahman hand-picked 700 fighters from his army and led them to Carmona's main gate. There, he started a great fire and threw his scabbard into the flames. Abd al-Rahman told his men that time had come to go down fighting than die of hunger.
The gate lifted and Abd ar-Rahman's men fell upon the unsuspecting Abbasids, thoroughly routing them. Most of the Abbasid army was killed. The heads of the main Abbasid leaders were cut off. Their heads were preserved in salt, and identifying tags pinned to their ears. The heads were bundled together in a gruesome package and sent to the Abbasid caliph who was on pilgrimage at [[Mecca]]. Upon receiving the evidence of al-Ala's defeat in al-Andalus, al-Mansur is said to have gasped, “God be praised for placing a sea between us”!&lt;ref&gt;Ahmed ibn Muhammad al-Maqqari, ''The History of the Mohammedan Dynasties in Spain'', p. 81&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Mansur hated, and yet apparently respected Abd al-Rahman to such a degree that he dubbed him the &quot;Hawk of Quraysh&quot; (The Umayyads were from a branch of the Quraysh tribe).&lt;ref&gt;Ahmed ibn Muhammad al-Maqqari, ''The History of the Mohammedan Dynasties in Spain''. p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; 

Despite such a tremendous victory, Abd al-Rahman had to continuously put down rebellions in al-Andalus.&lt;ref&gt;W. Montgomery Watt. ''Islamic Surveys 4: A History of Islamic Spain''. (Edinburgh; Edinburgh University Press, 1965), p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; Various Arab and Berber tribes fought each other for varying degrees of power, some cities tried to break away and form their own state, and even members of Abd al-Rahman's family tried to wrest power from him. During a large revolt, dissidents marched on Córdoba itself; However, Abd al-Rahman always managed to stay one step ahead, and crushed all opposition; as he always dealt severely with dissidence in al-Andalus.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas F. Glick. ''Islamic and Christian Spain in the Early Middle Ages''. (Princeton, [[Princeton University Press]]), p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; Despite all this turmoil in al-Andalus, Abd al-Rahman wanted to take the fight back east to Baghdad. Revenge for the massacre of his family at the hands of the Abbasids must surely have been the driving factor in Abd al-Rahman's war plans. However his war against Baghdad was put on hold by more internal problems. The seditious city of Zaragoza on the Upper March revolted in a bid for autonomy. Little could Abd al-Rahman have known that as he set off to settle matters in that northern city, his hopes of warring against Baghdad would be indefinitely put on hold.

===Problems in the Upper March===
Zaragoza  proved to be a most difficult city to reign over for not only Abd ar-Rahman, but his predecessors as well. In the year 777–778, several notable men including Sulayman ibn Yokdan al-Arabi al-Kelbi,&lt;ref&gt;Ahmed ibn Muhammad al-Maqqari, ''The History of the Mohammedan Dynasties in Spain'', p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; the self-appointed governor of Zaragoza, met with delegates of the leader of the Franks, [[Charlemagne]]. &quot;(Charlemagne's) army was enlisted to help the Muslim governors of Barcelona and Zaragoza against the Umayyad (emir) in Cordoba...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Jo Ann Hoeppner Moran Cruz. ''Western Views of Islam in Medieval and Early Modern Europe: Perception and Other''. Edited by David R. Blanks and Michael Frassetto. (New York, Saint Martin's Press, 1999), p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; Essentially Charlemagne was being hired as a mercenary, even though he likely had other plans of acquiring the area for his own empire.  After Charlemagne's columns arrived at the gates of Zaragoza, Sulayman got cold feet and refused to let the Franks into the city. It is possible that he realized that Charlemagne would want to usurp power from him. Charlemagne's force eventually headed back to France via a narrow pass in the Pyrenees, where a his rearguard was wiped out by [[Basque people|Basque]] and [[Duchy of Vasconia|Gascon]] rebels (this disaster inspired the epic [[Chanson de Roland]]).&lt;ref&gt;Philip K. Hitti. ''Makers of Arab History''. (New York. St Martin’s Press), 1968. p. 68&lt;/ref&gt;

Now Abd al-Rahman could deal with Sualyman and the city of Zaragoza without having to fight a massive Christian army. In 779 Abd ar-Rahman offered the job of Zaragoza's governorship to one of Sulayman's allies, a man named al-Husayn ibn Yahiya. The temptation was too much for al-Husayn who murdered his colleague Sulayman. As promised, al-Husayn was awarded Zaragoza  with the expectation that he would always be a subordinate of Córdoba. Within two years, however, al-Husayn broke off relations with Abd al-Rahman and announced that Zaragoza would be an independent city-state. Once again Abd al-Rahman had to be concerned with developments in the Upper March. He was intent on keeping his important northern border city within the Umayyad fold. By 783 Abd al-Rahman's army advanced on Zaragoza. It appeared as though Abd al-Rahman wanted to make clear to this troublesome city that independence was out of the question. Included in the arsenal of Abd al-Rahman's army were thirty-six [[siege engine]]s.&lt;ref&gt;José Luis Corral Lafuente. ''Historia de Zaragoza: Zaragoza Musulmana''. (Zaragoza; Ayuntamiento de Zaragoza, 1998), p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; Zaragoza's famous white granite [[defensive wall]]s were breached under a torrent of ordnance from the Umayyad lines. Abd al-Rahman's warriors spilled into the city's streets, quickly thwarting al-Husayn's desires for independence.

===Military and social reforms and constructions works===
After the aforementioned period of conflict, Abd al-Rahman continued in his improvement of al-Andalus' infrastructure. He ensured roadways were begun, aqueducts were constructed or improved, and that a new mosque was well funded in his capital at Córdoba. Construction on what would in time become the world famous  [[Great Mosque of Córdoba]] was started circa the year 786. Abd al-Rahman knew that one of his sons would one day inherit the rule of al-Andalus, but that it was a land torn by strife. In order to successfully rule in such a situation, Abd al-Rahman needed to create a reliable civil service and organize a standing army. He  felt that he could not always rely on the local populace in providing a loyal army; and therefore bought a massive [[standing army]] consisting mainly of Berbers from [[North Africa]]&lt;ref&gt;W. Montgomery Watt. ''Islamic Surveys 4: A History of Islamic Spain''. (Edinburgh, Edinburgh University Press, 1965), p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; as well as slaves from other areas. The total number of army-men under his command were nearly 40,000. As was common during the years of Islamic expansion from Arabia, [[Religious toleration|religious tolerance]] was practiced. Abd al-Rahman continued to allow Jews and Christians and other monotheistic religions to retain and practice their faiths. They did, however, have to pay a tribute tax for this privilege. Abd al-Rahman's policy of taxing non-Muslims, which was often carried out by later rulers, changed the religious dynamic of al-Andalus. Possibly because of excessive tribute taxes &quot;the bulk of the country's population must have become Muslim&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Philip K. Hitti. ''Makers of Arab History''. (New York. St Martin’s Press), 1968. p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; However, other scholars have argued that though 80% of al-Andalus converted to Islam, it did not truly occur until near the 10th century.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas F. Glick. ''Islamic and Christian Spain in the Early Middle Ages''. (Princeton, New Jersey. Princeton University Press), pp. 33–35. Glick based this work on a prior scholar's work ([[Bulliet]]). On page 33 of this book, Glick writes that Bulliet said &quot;that the rate of [[Religious conversion|conversion to Islam]] is logarithmic, and may be illustrated graphically by a logistic curve&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Christians more often converted to Islam than Jews although there were converted Jews among the new followers of Islam.  There was a great deal of freedom of interaction between the groups: for example, Sarah, the granddaughter of the Visigoth king [[Wittiza]], married a Muslim man and bore two sons who were later counted among the ranks of the highest Arab nobility.&lt;ref&gt;Marianne Barrucand &amp; Achim Bednorz.  ''Moorish Architecture in Andalusia''. (London, Taschen, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conclusion===
Near the end of his life, it is said that Abd al-Rahman became increasingly paranoid and would sequester himself to his palaces. In the final pages of his account of the life of Abd al-Rahman, writer al-Maqqari mentions that the emir treated many of his early friends, such as Bedr, with cruelty. He put some of his main supporters to death, exiled others, and reduced the rank of yet others. The date of Abd al-Rahman's death is disputed, but is generally accepted to be sometime around 785 through 788. Abd al-Rahman died in his adopted city of Córdoba, and was supposedly buried under the site of the Mezquita. Abd al-Rahman's alleged [[favorite son]] was his choice for successor, and would later be known as [[Hisham I]]. Abd ar-Rahman's progeny would continue to rule al-Andalus in the name of the house of Umayya for several generations, with the zenith of their power coming during the reign of [[Abd al-Rahman III]].

==Family==
Abd al-Rahman was the son of [[Mu'awiyah ibn Hisham|Mu'awiyah]], son of [[Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik|Hisham]], son of [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan|Abd al-Malik]] according to Abd el-Wahid Merrakechi when reciting his ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;Fagnan, E. (trans. &amp; ed.) (1893) Histoire des Almohades d´Abd el-Wahid Merrakechi (Algiers) (&quot;Abd el-Wahid Merrakechi&quot;), p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; Abd al-Rahman's mother was a member from the Nafza Berbers with whom he found refuge after the murder of his family in 750.&lt;ref&gt;Cherbonneau, M. A. (trans.) 'Chronique d'Ibn-el Kouthya', Journal Asiatique 5th series Tome VIII (Paris, 1856), p. 456.&lt;/ref&gt;

Abd al-Rahman married a woman named Hulal. She is said to be the mother of Hisham. Abd al-Rahman was the father of several sons, but the identity of their mother(s) is not clear:
* Sulayman (745–800)&lt;ref&gt;Cherbonneau, M. A. (trans.) 'Chronique d'Ibn-el Kouthya', Journal Asiatique 5th series Tome VIII (Paris, 1856), p. 475.&lt;/ref&gt; Governor of Toledo. Exiled after he refused to accept his brother Hisham's accession to the throne. Returned to challenge his nephew in 796, captured and executed in 800.

* [[Hisham I]] (757–17 Apr 796) Emir of Cordoba.
* Abdallah

==Legends==

In his lifetime, Abd al-Rahman was known as ''al Dakhil'' (&quot;the immigrant&quot;).  But he was also known as ''Saqr Quraish'' (&quot;The Falcon of the [[Quraysh (tribe)|Quraish]]&quot;), bestowed on him by one of his greatest enemies, the Abbasid caliph [[al-Mansur]].

According to the chroniclers, the Abbasid caliph al-Mansur once asked his courtiers who deserved the exalted title of &quot;Falcon of the Quraish&quot; (foremost leader of the Prophet's tribe). The obsequious courtiers naturally replied &quot;You, oh Commander of the Faithful!&quot;, but the Caliph said no. Then they suggested [[Muawiyah I|Mu'awiya]] (founder of the Umayyad Caliphate), but the Caliph again said no. Then they suggested [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan]] (one the greatest of the Umayyad caliphs), but again no.

'''Abd ar-Rahman II''' ({{lang-ar|&lt;big&gt;عبد الرحمن الثاني&lt;/big&gt;}}) (788–852) was  [[Umayyad]] [[Emir of Córdoba]] in the [[Al-Andalus]] ([[Moors|Moorish]] [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]]) from 822 until his death.

He was born in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], the son of [[Emir]] [[Al-Hakam I]]. In his youth he took part in the so-called &quot;massacre of the ditch&quot;, when from 700 to 5000 people come to pay homage to the prince were killed by order of Al-Hakam.

He succeeded his father as Emir of [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]] in 822 and engaged in nearly continuous warfare against [[Alfonso II of Asturias]], whose southward advance he halted (822–842). In 837 he suppressed a revolt of [[Christians]] and [[Jew]]s in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]]. He issued a decree by which the Christians were forbidden to seek for martyrdom, and he had a Christian [[synod]] to be held to declare against the martyrdom.

In 844 Abd ar-Rahman repulsed an assault by [[Vikings]] who had disembarked in [[Cadiz]], conquered [[Seville]] (with the exception of its citadel) and attacked  Córdoba itself. Thereafter he constructed a fleet and naval [[arsenal]] at [[Seville]] to repel future raids. 

He responded to [[William of Septimania]]'s requests of assistance in his struggle against [[Charles the Bald]]'s nominations.

Abd ar-Rahman was famous for his public building program in Córdoba where he died in 852. A vigorous and effective frontier warrior, he was also well-known as a patron of the arts.&lt;ref&gt;[[Chambers Biographical Dictionary]], ISBN 0-550-18022-2, page 2&lt;/ref&gt;  He was also involved in the execution of the &quot;[[Martyrs of Córdoba]]&quot;.

Called ''al-Nasir li-Din Allah'' (&quot;the Defender of God's Faith&quot;), he ascended the throne when he was twenty-two years of age and reigned for half a century as the most powerful prince of Iberia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/197605/the.golden.caliphate.htm The Golden Caliphate]&lt;/ref&gt; Although under his rule, people of all creeds enjoyed tolerance and [[freedom of religion]], he repelled the [[Fatimid]]s, partly by supporting their enemies in [[Ifriqiya]], and partly by claiming the title [[Caliph]] (ruler of the [[Muslim world|Islamic world]]) for himself.

==Life==
===Early years===
Abd ar-Rahman was born in [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]], the grandson of [[Abdallah ibn Muhammad|Abdullah]], seventh independent [[Umayyad]] emir of [[Al-Andalus]], and the son of Muhammad and Muzna or Muzayna, a Christian concubine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bookrags.com/biography/abd-al-rahman-iii/ Abd al-Rahman, III Biography]&lt;/ref&gt; His paternal grandmother was also a Christian, the royal infanta [[Onneca Fortúnez]], daughter of captive king [[Fortún Garcés of Pamplona]], and he was thus nephew in the half-blood of queen [[Toda of Navarre]]. He is described as having:

{{bquote|.. white skin, blue eyes and attractive face; good looking, although somewhat sturdy and stout. His legs were short, at the point that the stirrups of his saddle were mounted just one palm under it. When mounting, he looked tall, but once at feet he was quite short. He dyed his beard black.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ibn Idhari]], ''Kitab al-Bayan''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Muhammad was assassinated by his brother Al-Mutarrif, who had allegedly grown jealous of the favour Abdallah had gained by his merits, and had accused Muhammad of plotting with the rebel [[Umar ibn Hafsun]]. Al-Mutarrif had thus spent a spell in prison. According to some sources, the emir himself was behind Muhammad's fall, as well as Al-Mutarrif's death in 895. Abd ar-Rahman spent his youth in his mother's harem. Al-Mutarrif's sister, known as ''al-Sayyida'' (&quot;the Lady&quot;) was entrusted with his education, which she carried out with some rigidity.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ibn Hazm]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accession to throne===
{{Refimprove|date=November 2010}}
Emir Abdallah died at seventy-two. Despite his having four sons alive at the time of his death (Aban, Abd al Rahman, Muhammad and Ahmad), all of them were surpassed for succession, instead Abdallah chose as his successor the son of his first son, Abd al-Rahman III. This came as no surprise, since he had demonstrated his affection for his grandson in many ways already, namely by allowing him to live in his own tower (something he did not allow for any of his sons), allowing him to sit on the throne on some festive occasions, and most importantly by giving him his ring, symbol of power when he fell ill prior to his death. He succeeded him the very next day after his death, 16 October 912. Historiographers of his time, such as al-Bayan l'Mogrib and the ''Cronica anonima de Abd-ar-Rahman III'', state that his succession was &quot;without incidents&quot;.  At the time he was twenty-one years old. He inherited an emirate on the verge of dissolution, his power extending not far beyond the vicinity of Córdoba. To the north, the Christian [[Kingdom of Asturias]] was continuing its program of ''[[Reconquista]]'' in the [[Duero]] valley. To the south, in Ifriqiya, the Fatimids had created an independent caliphate, which could attract the allegiance of the Muslim population suffering the harsh rule of Abdullah. On the internal front the discontented [[Muladi]] families (Muslims of Iberian origin) constituted a constant danger for the Córdoban emir. The most powerful of the latter was the aforementioned Umar ibn Hafsun, who, from his impregnable fortress of [[Bobastro]], controlled much of the eastern Al-Andalus.

Since the very early stages of his reign, Abd ar-Rahman showed a firm resolve to quash the rebels of Al-Andalus, consolidate the central power and reestablish the internal order in the emirate. To accomplish his aims he introduced into the court the ''[[saqaliba]]h'', slaves of East European origin and a third ethnic group that could neutralize the endless strife between his Muslim subjects of [[Arab people|Arab]] and [[Berber people|Berber]] heritage.

===Early rule===
In the first twenty years of his rule of forty-nine, Abd ar-Rahman avoided military action against the northern Christian kingdoms, Asturias and [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]]. The Muladi rebels were the first problem he confronted. Those powerful families were supported by Iberians who were openly or secretly Christians and had acted with the rebels. These elements, which formed the bulk of the population, were not averse to supporting a strong ruler who would protect them against the Arab aristocracy. Abd ar-Rahman moved to subdue them by means of a mercenary army that included Christians.

[[Image:Mosque of Cordoba Spain.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The [[Great Mosque of Córdoba]].]]
He first had to suppress the rebel Umar ibn Hafsun. On 1 January 913 an army, led by the eunuch Badr, conquered the fortress of [[Écija]], at some 50&amp;nbsp;km from the capital. All the city's fortifications were destroyed, aside from the citadel, which was left as residence of the governor and a garrison for the emiral troops. In the following spring, after sixty-five days of meticulous preparations, Abd ar-Rahman personally led an expedition to the south of his realm. His troops were able to recover the ''coras'' (provinces) of [[Jaén (Spanish province)|Jaén]] and [[Granada|Elvira]], while a cavalry detachment was sent to free [[Málaga]] from ibn Hafsun's siege. He also obtained the capitulation of [[Fiñana]] (in the modern [[province of Almería]]), after setting fire to its suburbs. Subsequently he moved against the castle of [[Juviles]] in the [[Alpujarras]]. After devastating its countryside to deprive it of any resource, he encircled it. Finding it difficult to bombard with catapults, he ordered the construction of a platform where his [[siege weapon]]s could be mounted to greater effect, and cut the water supply. The Muladi defenders surrendered after a few days: their lives, apart from fifty-five die-hards who were beheaded, were spared in exchange of their allegiance to the emir. The campaign continued in a similar vein, lasting for a total of ninety days. Abd ar-Rahman forced the defeated Muladi to send hostages and treasures to Córdoba, in order to secure their continued submission.

In the first year of his reign, Abd ar-Rahman took advantage of the rivalries between the [[Banu Hayyay]] lords of [[Seville]] and [[Carmona]] to force them to submit. He initially sent a special corps (''hasam'') under Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Hudayr, governor of Écija, to Seville, to obtain their submission. This attempt failed, but gained him the support of Muhammad ibn Ibrahim ibn Hayyay, lord of Carmona, and a cousin of the Sevillan lord, Ahmad ibn Maslama. When the latter was surrounded by Umayyad troops, he sued for help to Ibn Hafsun, but the latter was defeated by the besiegers and returned to Bobastro. Seville finally capitulated on 20 December 913. Ibn al-Mundir al-Qurays, a member of the royal family, was named governor of the city, while the Lord of Carmona obtained the title of [[vizier]]. Muhammad ibn Ibrahim enjoyed his office for only a single day, for Abd ar-Rahman soon discovered his collusion with the rebel governor of Carmona. Muhammad was sent to prison, where he later met his death.

The region of [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]] submitted peacefully in 915.

===Ibn Hafsun and other rebels===

Abd ar-Rahman's next objective was to squash the longstanding rebellion of Ibn Hafsun.

His troops left Córdoba on 7 May 914 and, after a few days, encamped  before the walls of Balda (identified with today's [[Cuevas de San Marcos]]). His cavalry ravaged the nearby woods and the countryside, while the rest of the troopes moved to Turrus, a castle located in the present municipality of [[Algarinejo, Granada|Algarinejo]], which was surrounded within five days, while its environs were also devastated.

The Umayyad army then moved to Bobastro, while the cavalry was sent to the castle of Sant Batir, which was abandoned by the defenders, allowing Abd ar-Rahman's troops to secure a large booty. Then it was the turn of the castles of Olías and Reina. The latter fell after a violent fight, leaving the road open to the major city and provincial capital of Málaga, which he captured after one day. Abd ar-Rahman then turned and followed the coast by Montemayor, near [[Benahavís]], Suhayl ([[Fuengirola]]) and another castle called ''Turrus ''or ''Turrus Jusayn'' (identified by [[Évariste Lévi-Provençal]] as [[Ojén]]). He finally arrived  at [[Algeciras]] on 1 June 914. He ordered a patrol of the coast to destroy the boats that supplied Ibn Hafsun from North Africa. Many of them were captured and set afire in front of the emir. The rebellious castles near Algeciras surrendered as soon as the Cordoban army manifested itself.

Abd ar-Rahman launched three different campaigns against Ibn Hafsun (who died in 917) and his sons. Among them, Jafar ibn Hafsun held the stronghold of Toledo. Abd ar-Rahman ordered ravaged the city's countryside. Jafar, after two years of siege, escaped the city to ask for help in the northern Christian kingdoms. In the meantime Abd ar-Rahman obtained the surrender of the city from its population, after promising them immunity, although 4,000 rebel men escaped in a night sally. The city surrendered on 2 August 932, after a siege of two years.

In 921 the Banu Muhallab of [[Guadix]] submitted, followed by those of [[Jerez de la Frontera|Jerez]] and [[Cádiz]], as well as the trading republic of [[Pechina]] (922). In 927, Abd-ar-Rahman also launched a campaign against the rebel [[Banu Qasi]] clan, but was forced to break it off by the intervention of King [[Jimeno Garcés of Pamplona]].

The last of Ibn Hafsun to fall was Hafs, who stood in his powerful fortress of Bobastro. Surrounded by the vizier Said ibn al-Mundhir who had ordered the construction of bastions around the city, he resisted the siege for six months, until he surrendered, having his life spared (928).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Hermann |last=Schreiber|title=Gli Arabi in Spagna|page=142|publisher=Garzanti}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Levente and Algarve rebels===
The continued expeditions against the Hafsunids did not distract Abd ad-Rahman III from the situation of other regions in al-Andalus, which recognized him only nominally, if not being in open revolt. Most of the loyal governors of the cities were in a tottering position, such as the one of [[Évora]], who could not prevent the attack of the king of Galicia (future king of León), [[Ordoño II of León|Ordoño II]], who captured the city in the summer of 913, taking back a sizable booty and 4,000 prisoners.

In much of the eastern and western province, Abd ar-Rahman's authority was completely unrecognized. The lord of Badajoz, Abd Allah ibn Muhammad, grandson of Abd-ar-Rahman ibn Marwan al-Yilliqi, not only fortified his city against a possible attack of Ordoño, but also acted in complete independence from Córdoba. To avoid the fall of Évora into the hands of Berber groups of the region, he ordered the destruction of its defensive towers and to lowered the walls, though a year later he decided to reconstruct it, giving it its Masud ally ibn Sa' dun al-Surunbaqi. The Algarve was dominated completely by a muladí coalition led by Sa'id ibn Mal, who had expelled the Arabs from Beja, and the lords of Ocsónoba, Yahya ibn Bakr, and of [[Niebla]], Ibn Ufayr.

The absence of royal authority enabled Ordoño II to easily campaign in this area, his main objective begin the city of [[Mérida, Spain|Mérida]], in the summer of  915. Abd ar-Rahman III did not send an army and only several local Berber ''jefes'' offered a pointless resistance.

In the next year, despite having quenched only the majority of the rebels,  Abd ar-Rahman III found himself powerful enough to he declared himself as the [[Caliph of Córdoba]] (16 January 929), effectively breaking all allegiance to, and ties with, the [[Fatimid]] and [[Abbasid]] caliphs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allaboutphilosophy.org/abd-ar-rahman-iii.htm Abd-ar-Rahman III]&lt;/ref&gt;  The caliphate was thought only to belong to the prince who ruled over the sacred cities of [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]], and his ancestors had so far contended of the title of emir. But the force of this tradition had weakened over time; and the title increased Abd-ar-Rahman's prestige with his subjects, both in Iberia and Africa. He based his claim to the caliphate on his Umayyad ancestors who had held undisputed control of the caliphate until they were overthrown by the Abbasids.

Abd ar-Rhaman's move made him both the political and the religious leader of all the Muslims in al-Andalus, as well as the protector of his Christian and Jew subjects. The symbols of his new caliphal power were a sceptre (''jayzuran'') and the throne (''sarir''). In the mint he had founded in November 928, Abd ar-Rahman started to coin golden dinars&lt;ref&gt;No golden Islamic coins had been found in Spain preceding Abd ar-Rahman III's reign. See Schreiber, ''Gli Arabi in Spagna'', p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt; and silver dirhams, replacing the &quot;al-Andalus&quot; specification with his name.

In his new role of caliph, he obtained the surrender of  [[Ibn Marwan]] of Badajoz in 930.  On the southern front, to counter the increasing Fatimid power in North Africa, abd ar-Rahmad ordered the construction of a fleet based in [[Almeria]]:  the caliph helped the [[Maghrawa]] Berbers conquer [[Melilla]] (927), [[Ceuta]] (931) and [[Tangiers]] (951), which accepted his suzerainty. In 951 he signed a peace with the new king of León, [[Ordoño III of León|Ordoño III]], in order to have free hand against the Fatimids whose ships were hararssing the caliphal ones in the Mediterranean and had even launched an assault against Almeria. Abd ar-Rahman's force, led by prime minister Ahmad ibn Said, besieged the Fatimid port of Tunis, which bought its safety through a huge sum.&lt;ref&gt;Schreiber, ''Gli Arabi in Spagna'', p. 154&lt;/ref&gt;

In the end he was able to create a sort of protectorate on the northern and central Maghreb, supporting the [[Idrisid]] dynasty; the caliphal influence in the area disappeared after a Fatimid offensive in 958, after which abd ar-Rahman kept only the strongholds of Ceuta and Tangiers.

===War with the Christian kingdoms of the north===
Even before having al-Andalus firmly under his rule, he restarted the war against King [[Ordoño II of León]], who had taken advantage of the previous troublesome situation to capture some boundary areas and menace the Umayyad territory. In 917 the then-emir had sent a large army under his general Ahmad ibn Abi Abda against León, but this was destroyed near [[San Esteban de Gormaz]] in September of that year.

Recognizing to have underestimated the power of Ordoño II, in 920 he mustered another powerful army to reclaim the territories lost after the previous campaign. After defeating, on 26 July, king [[Sancho Garcés I of Navarre]] at [[Junquera]], he penetrated in Navarre overcoming the Aragon by the classic route of the invasions from the south. Abd ar-Rahman reached the Basque city of [[Pamplona]], which was sacked, its cathedral church being demolished.

The succession crisis which struck León after Ordoño II's death in 924 caused hostilities to cease until [[Ramiro II of León|Ramiro II]] obtained the throne in 932; a first attempt from him to assist the besieged rebels in Toledo was repelled in 932, despite the Christian king was able to capture [[Madrid]] and to score a victory at [[Osma]].

In 934, after reasserting supremacy over Pamplona and [[Álava]], he forced Ramiro to retreat to [[Burgos]], and forced the Navarrese queen [[Toda of Navarre|Toda]], his aunt, to submit to him as a vassal and withdraw from direct rule as regent for her son [[García Sánchez I of Pamplona|García Sánchez I]]. In 937 he conquered some thirty castles in León. Next he turned to Muhammad ibn Hashim at-Tugib, governor of [[Zaragoza]], who had allied with Ramiro but was pardoned after the capture of his city.

Despite early defeats, Ramiro and García were able to crush the caliphate army in 939 at the [[Battle of Simancas]], most likely, in part, to treason from Arabic elements in the caliph's army. After this defeat, Abd-ar-Rahman stopped taking personal command of his military campaigns. His cause was however helped by [[Fernán González of Castile]], one of the Christian leaders at Simancas, who subsequently launched a sustained rebellion against Ramiro. The victory of Simancas enabled the Christian kingdom to maintain the military initiative in the peninsula until the defeat of Ramiro's successor, [[Ordoño III of León]], in 956.

Until 961, the caliphate played an active role in the dynastic strife which characterized the Christian kingdom in the period. Ordoño III's half-brother and successor, [[Sancho I of Leon|Sancho the Fat]], had been deposed by his cousin [[Ordoño IV of León|Ordoño IV]]. Together with his grandmother Toda of Navarre, Sancho sued for an alliance with Córdoba. In exchange for some castles, Abd-ar-Rahman helped them to take back [[Zamora, Spain|Zamora]] (959) and [[Oviedo]] (960) and to overthrow Ordoño IV.

In 950 abd ar-Rahman received in Córdoba an embassy from count [[Borrell II of Barcelona]], by which the northern county recognized the caliphal supremacy in exchange of peace and mutual support.

===Later years===
Abd-ar-Rahman was accused of having sunk in his later years into the self-indulgent habits of the [[harem]].&lt;ref name=wikisource&gt;[[s:1911 Encyclopædia Britannica/Abd-ar-Rahman|Article on WikiSource]]&lt;/ref&gt; He is known to have openly kept a male as well as female harem.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of Medieval Iberia, ed. Michael Gerli (New York:
Routledge, 2003), 398–399.&lt;/ref&gt;

This likely influenced the polemical story of falling in love with a thirteen-year old boy (later enshrined as a Christian martyr and canonised as [[Pelagius of Cordova|Saint Pelagius of Córdoba]]) who refused the Caliph's advances. However, the love story may have been a construct on top of an original tale, in which he ordered the boy-slave to convert to Islam. Either way, enraged, he had the boy tortured and dismembered, thus serving as [[Christian]] polemic demonising [[Muslims]].&lt;ref&gt;Walter Andrews and Mehmet Kalpaklı, ''The Age of Beloveds'', Duke University Press, 2005; p.2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mark D. Jordan, ''The Invention of Sodomy in Christian Theology'', Chicago, 1997; pp.10–28&lt;/ref&gt;

Abd-ar-Rahman spent the rest of his years in his new palace outside Córdoba. He died in October 961, and was succeeded by his son [[Al-Hama II|al-Hakam II]].

==Legacy==
Abd-ar-Rahman was a patron of arts, and especially architecture. A third of his revenue sufficed for the ordinary expenses of government, a third was hoarded and a third spent on buildings.&lt;ref name=wikisource/&gt; After declaring the caliphate, he had a massive palace complex, known as the [[Medina Azahara]], built some 5 kilometers north of Córdoba.  The Medina Azahara was modelled after the old Umayyad palace in [[Damascus]] and served as a symbolic tie between the new caliph and his ancestors.

Under his reign, Córdoba became the most important intellectual centre of Western Europe. He expanded the city's library, which would be further enriched by his successors.

{{bquote|I have now reigned above fifty years in victory or peace; beloved by my subjects, dreaded by my enemies, and respected by my allies. Riches and honours, power and pleasure, have waited on my call, nor does any earthly blessing appear to have been wanting to my felicity. In this situation, I have diligently numbered the days of pure and genuine happiness which have fallen to my lot: they amount to Fourteen: - O man! place not thy confidence in this present world!}}

He also reinforced the Iberian fleet, which became the most powerful in the [[Mediterranean Europe]]. Iberian raiders moved up to [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], Asturias and North Africa. The colonizers of [[Fraxinetum]] came from al-Andalus as well.

==Ancestry==
Abd-ar-Rahman III's mother Muzna was a Christian captive, possibly from the [[Pyrenees|Pyrenean]] region. His paternal grandmother [[Onneca Fortúnez]] was a Christian princess from the [[Kingdom of Navarre|Kingdom of Pamplona]]. In his immediate ancestry, Abd-ar-Rahman III was thus three-quarters [[Spanish people|Hispano]]&amp;ndash;[[Basque people|Basque]], and only one-quarter [[Arab people|Arab]]. This gave him European facial features, with blue eyes, light skin and reddish hair.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fletcher&quot;/&gt;

'''Abd ar-Rahman IV Mortada''' ('''عبدالرحمن''') was the [[Caliph of Cordoba]] in the [[Umayyad]] dynasty of the [[Al-Andalus]] ([[Moors|Moorish]] [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]]), succeeding [[Suleiman II of Córdoba|Suleiman II]], in 1018. That same year, he was murdered at [[Cadiz]] while fleeing from a battle in which he had been deserted by the very supporters which had brought him into power. His brief reign was similar to that of [[Abd ar-Rahman V|Abd ar-Rahman V Mostadir]].

'''Abd ar-Rahman V''' ({{Lang-ar|عبد الرحمن الخامس}}) was an Umayyad [[Caliphate of Córdoba|Caliph of Córdoba]].

In the agony of the [[Umayyad]] dynasty in the [[Al-Andalus]] ([[Moors|Moorish]] [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]]), two princes of the house were proclaimed [[Caliph of Cordoba]] for a very short time, '''[[Abd-ar-Rahman IV]]''' Mortada (1017), and '''Abd-ar-Rahman V''' Mostadir (1023–1024). Both were the mere puppets of factions, who deserted them at once. Abd-ar-Rahman IV was murdered the same year he was proclaimed at [[Cadiz]], in flight from a battle in which he had been deserted by his supporters. Abd-ar-Rahman V was proclaimed caliph in December 1023 at [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]], and murdered in January 1024 by a mob of unemployed workmen, headed by one of his own cousins.

'''Abdülaziz I''' or '''Abd Al-Aziz''', His Imperial Majesty ([[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]]: ''`Abdü´l-Âzīz-i evvel'' عبد العزيز) (February 9/18 1830 &amp;ndash; 4 June 1876) was the 32nd [[Sultan]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]] and reigned between 25 June 1861 and 30 May 1876. He was the son of Sultan [[Mahmud II]] and succeeded his brother [[Abdülmecid I]] in 1861.&lt;ref&gt;[[Chambers Biographical Dictionary]], ISBN 0-550-18022-2, page 2&lt;/ref&gt;

Born at the [[Eyüp|Eyüp Palace]], Constantinople,&lt;ref&gt;''The Encyclopædia Britannica'', Vol.7, Edited by Hugh Chisholm, (1911), 3; ''Constantinople, the capital of the Turkish Empire...''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9368294/Istanbul Britannica, Istanbul]:''When the Republic of Turkey was founded in 1923, the capital was moved to Ankara, and Constantinople was officially renamed Istanbul in 1930.''&lt;/ref&gt; on 9/18 February 1830, Abdülaziz received an Ottoman education but was nevertheless an ardent admirer of the material progress that was made in the West. He was interested in literature and was also a classical music composer. Some of his compositions have been collected in the album ''&quot;European Music at the Ottoman Court&quot;'' by the London Academy of Ottoman Court Music.

== Family ==

His parents were [[Mahmud II]] and [[Valide Sultan]] [[Pertevniyal]] (&quot;Partav-Nihal&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;[http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~dantrogers/pafg1639.htm Daniel T.

In 1868 Pertevniyal was living in the [[Dolmabahçe Palace]]. That year Abdülaziz led the visiting [[Eugénie de Montijo]], Empress of France, to see his mother.

== Reign ==
[[File:Punch sultan visit 1867reduced.png|thumb|right|[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]] cartoon commenting on the 1867 visit of the Sultan to Britain.]]
[[File:Sultan tombs Divan Yolu March 2008.JPG|thumb|The mausoleum (''türbe'') of Sultan Mehmet II in Divan Yolu street, where Abdülaziz is buried as well]]
Between 1861 and 1871, the [[Tanzimat]] reforms which began during the reign of his brother [[Abdülmecid I]] were continued under the leadership of his chief ministers, [[Keçecizade Mehmet Fuat Pasha]] and [[Mehmed Emin Aali Pasha]]. [[Subdivisions of the Ottoman Empire#Administrative reform, 1864|New administrative districts (''vilayets'')]] were set up in 1864 and a [[Council of State]] was established in 1868. Public education was organized on the [[Education in France|French model]] and [[Istanbul University]] was reorganized as a modern institution in 1861.

Abdülaziz cultivated good relations with the [[Second French Empire]] and the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]]. In 1867 he was the first Ottoman sultan to visit [[Western Europe]]; his trip included a visit to England, where he was made a [[List of Knights and Ladies of the Garter|Knight of the Garter]] by [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] and shown a [[Fleet Review, Royal Navy#Queen Victoria|Royal Navy Fleet Review]] with [[Ismail of Egypt]].  He travelled by a private rail car, which today can be found in the [[Rahmi M. Koç Museum]] in Istanbul. His fellow Knights of the Garter created in 1867 were [[Charles Gordon-Lennox, 6th Duke of Richmond]], [[Charles Manners, 6th Duke of Rutland]], [[Henry Somerset, 8th Duke of Beaufort]], [[Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn]], [[Franz Joseph I of Austria]] and [[Alexander II of Russia]].

Caliber: 140mm, length: 339cm, weight: 2533kg, ammunition: 10kg iron ball. Remitted by Abdülaziz to [[Napoleon III]] in 1862.]]
In 1869,  Abdülaziz received visits from [[Eugénie de Montijo]], Empress consort of [[Napoleon III of France]] and other foreign monarchs on their way to the opening of the [[Suez Canal]]. The [[Prince of Wales]], the future [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom]], twice visited Constantinople.

By 1871 both ʿAlī Pasha and Fuʿād Pasha were dead. The Second French Empire, his Western European model, had been defeated in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] by the [[North German Confederation]] under the leadership of the [[Kingdom of Prussia]]. In foreign policy, Abdülaziz turned to the [[Russian Empire]] for friendship, as turmoil in the Balkan provinces continued. In 1875, the [[Herzegovinian rebellion]] was the beginning of further unrest in the Balkan provinces. In 1876, the [[April Uprising]] saw insurrection spreading among the [[Bulgarians]]. Ill feeling mounted against Russia for its encouragement of the rebellions.

The crop failure of 1873, the sultan's lavish expenditures for the [[Ottoman Navy]] and the new palaces which he built, and the mounting public debt heightened public discontent. Abdülaziz was deposed by his ministers on 30 May 1876; his death at [[Galatasaray University|Feriye Palace]] in Constantinople a few days later was attributed to suicide at the time,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Palace of Topkapi in Istanbul| last=Davis| first=Claire| year=1970| pages=222| publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons| location=New York| id=ASIN B000NP64Z2}}&lt;/ref&gt; although in [[Abdul Hamid II|Sultan Abdulhamid II]]'s recently surfaced memoirs, the event is described as an assassination by the order of [[Huseyin Avni]] and [[Mithat Pasha]], when [[Murad V|Sultan Murad V]] began to show signs of paranoia, madness and continuous feinting and vomiting even on the day of his coronation and threw himself to a pool yelling at his guards to protect his life. They were afraid the public would become outraged and revolt to bring the former Sultan back, so in a few days, on 4 June 1876, they arranged Sultan Abdülaziz to kill himself with a scissors, cutting his two wrists at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Sultan Abdülhamid'in Hatıra Defteri| last=Bozdağ| first=İsmet| year=2000| pages=223| publisher=Pınar Yayınları| location=İstanbul| id=ISBN 9753520344}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was unclear how the Sultan got hold of a scissors in the tower prison cell he was imprisoned in, how he managed to cut two wrists at once and no autopsy was allowed afterwards. But the event was recorded as suicide officially and he was buried in Istanbul.

== Achievements ==
The biggest achievement of Abdülaziz was to modernize the Ottoman Navy. In 1875, the Navy had 21 battleships and 173 warships of other types, ranking as the third largest navy in the world after the British and French navies.

He established the first Ottoman railroad network and [[Sirkeci Station|Sirkeci Train Station]] in Constantinople, terminus of the [[Orient Express]].

Impressed by the museums in London, Paris and Vienna, he established the [[Istanbul Archaeology Museum]].

Under Abdülaziz's reign, [[Postage stamps and postal history of Turkey#Tughra issue|Turkey's first postage stamps]] were issued in 1863, and Turkey joined the [[Universal Postal Union]] in 1875 as a founding member.

He was made the 756th [[Knight]] of the [[Order of the Garter]] in 1867 and the 127th [[Grand Cross]] of the [[Order of the Tower and Sword]].

== Marriages and issue ==
[[Image:Bedroom of Sultan Abdulaziz Dolmabahce March 2008pano.jpg|thumb|Bedroom of Sultan Abdül Aziz  in [[Dolmabahçe Palace]].]]

It was founded by the [[Carthage|Carthaginians]] as a trading station, and after a period of decline became under the Romans one of the more important towns in the province of [[Hispania Baetica]]. It was situated on a hill above the modern [[Adra, Spain|Adra]].

Of its coins the most ancient bear the [[Phoenicia]]n inscription ''abdrt'' with the head of [[Heracles]] (Melkarth) and a [[tuna|tunny-fish]]; those of [[Tiberius]] (who seems to have made the place a [[colonia]]) show the chief temple of the town with two tunny-fish erect in the form of columns.

'''Abdera''' ({{lang-el|Άβδηρα}}) was a [[city-state]] on the coast of [[Thrace]] 17&amp;nbsp;km east-northeast of the mouth of the [[Nestos]], and almost opposite [[Thasos]]. The site now lies in the [[Xanthi (peripheral unit)|Xanthi peripheral unit]] of modern [[Greece]]. The municipality of Abdera, or Ávdira ({{lang-el|Άβδηρα}}, {{IPA-el|ˈavðira|}}), has 18,573 inhabitants (2001). The seat of the municipality is in [[Genisea]].&lt;ref name=Kallikratis&gt;[http://www.kedke.gr/uploads2010/FEKB129211082010_kallikratis.pdf Kallikratis law] Greece Ministry of Interior {{el icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Abdera location.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Location of Abdera and its two successive [[metropolis]]es, [[Clazomenae]] and [[Teos]].]]
[[File:Abderacoin.png|thumb|200px|right|The chief coin type, with griffon.]]
Its mythical foundation was attributed to [[Heracles]] (on behalf of his fallen friend [[Abderus]]), its historical one to a colony from [[Klazomenai]].  This historical founding was traditionally dated to [[654 BC]], which is unverified, although evidence in 7th century BC [[Pottery of ancient Greece|Greek pottery]] tends to support it.&lt;ref name=&quot;OCD&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia| last = Hornblower| first = Simon| title = Abdera | encyclopedia = The Oxford Classical Dictionary| pages = 1| publisher = Oxford University Press| location = Oxford| year = 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;  But its prosperity dates from [[544 BC]], when the majority of the people of [[Teos]] (including the poet [[Anacreon]]) migrated to Abdera to escape the [[Iran|Persian]] yoke ([[Herodotus]] i.168).  The chief coin type, a ''[[griffon]]'', is identical with that of Teos; the rich silver coinage is noted for the beauty and variety of its reverse types.

In [[513 BC]] and [[512 BC]], the Persians conquered Abdera. In [[492 BC]], the Persians again conquered Abdera, this time under [[Darius I]]. It later became part of the [[Delian League]] and fought on the side of Athens in the [[Peloponnesian war]].

Abdera was a wealthy city, the third richest in the League, due to its status as a prime port for trade with the interior of Thrace and the [[Odrysian kingdom]].&lt;ref name=&quot;OCD&quot;/&gt;

A valuable prize, the city was repeatedly sacked: by the [[Triballi]] in [[376 BC]], [[Philip II of Macedon]] in [[350 BC]]; later by [[Lysimachus|Lysimachos of Thrace]], the [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucids]], the [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemies]], and again by the Macedonians. In [[170 BC]] the Roman armies and those of [[Eumenes II|Eumenes II of Pergamon]] besieged and sacked it.

The town seems to have declined in importance after the middle of the 4th century BC. The air of Abdera was proverbial in Athens as causing stupidity,&lt;ref&gt;Cicero. ''Epistulae ad Atticum'',  4.17.3, 7.7.4.&lt;/ref&gt; but the city counted among its citizens the philosophers [[Democritus]], [[Protagoras]] and [[Anaxarchus]], and historian and philosopher [[Hecataeus of Abdera]].

The ruins of the town may still be seen on Cape Balastra; they cover seven small hills, and extend from an eastern to a western harbor; on the southwestern hills are the remains of the medieval settlement of Polystylon. Abdera is a [[titular see]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] in the province of [[Rhodope]] on the southern coast of Thrace, now called Bouloustra.

==Municipality== 
The municipality Abdera was formed at the 2011 local government reform by the merger of the following 3 former municipalities, that became municipal units:&lt;ref name=Kallikratis/&gt;

After Christians in Ephesus first wrote to their counterparts recommending Apollos to them, he went to [[Achaia]].&lt;ref&gt;So the [[Alexandrian text-type|Alexandrian recension]]; the text in [[Papyrus 38|&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{P}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sup&gt;38&lt;/sup&gt;]] and [[Codex Bezae]] indicate that Apollos went to Corinth.

It is difficult to get a correct idea of his religious standpoint, although it probably was that of the [[Disciple (Christianity)#Other Biblical uses|disciples]] of [[John the Baptist]] that Paul encountered in Ephesus.{{Bibleref2c|Ac.|19:1-7}} These twelve had never heard of the [[Holy Spirit]]{{Bibleref2c|Ac.|19:2}} which had been poured out on the believers in [[Jerusalem in Christianity|Jerusalem]] on the day of [[Pentecost]].{{Bibleref2c|Ac.|2:4}} This was the baptism of the Holy Spirit that Jesus said would follow the water baptism of John.{{Bibleref2c|Ac.|1:5}} [[Priscilla and Aquila]], who accompanied  Paul to Ephesus, correctively instructed the eloquent and brilliant Apollos. He knew and preached boldly to the crowds only the baptism of John and nothing of salvation through Christ. &quot;When Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they invited him to their home and explained to him the way of God more adequately.&quot;{{bibleref2c|Acts|18:26}}

==Possible preaching style==
Apollos may have captivated his hearers by teaching &quot;wisdom&quot; in the allegorical style of [[Philo]]. He was evidently a man of unusual magnetic force. This suggestion has been recently repeated by [[Jerome Murphy-O'Connor]]: &quot;It is difficult to imagine that an Alexandrian Jew ... could have escaped the influence of Philo, the great intellectual leader ... particularly since the latter seems to have been especially concerned with education and preaching.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;J Murphy-O'Connor. ''Paul: A critical life.'' Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1996, p. 275&lt;/ref&gt;

==Divisions in Corinthian church==
In {{Bibleref2|1Co.|1:10-12||1 Cor. 1:10-12}} are references to four parties in the Corinthian church, of which two attached themselves to Paul and Apollos respectively, using their names (the third and fourth were Peter, identified as Cephas, and Jesus himself). There is no indication that Apollos favored or approved an overestimation of his person. Since Paul, in the [[Epistle to the Romans]], indicated he preferred to be the first to evangelize to a group, it is likely that Paul's preachings were somewhat less intricate compared to those of Apollos, especially given what was mentioned of Apollos's style.

==Retirement and bishop status==
[[Jerome]] states that Apollos was so dissatisfied with the division at Corinth, that he retired to Crete with Zenas, a doctor of the law; and that the schism having been healed by Paul's letter to the Corinthians, Apollos returned to the city, and became its bishop.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} Less probable traditions assign to him the bishopric of Duras, or of Iconium in Phrygia, or of Caesarea. In the [[Epistle to Titus]], {{Bibleref2c-nb|Titus|3:13}} Apollos is mentioned with Zenas as bearer of the letter to Crete.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

==Other==
[[Martin Luther]] and some modern scholars have proposed Apollos as the author of the [[Epistle to the Hebrews]], rather  than [[Barnabas]], another contender.  Both were Hebrew Christians with sufficient intellectual authority.&lt;ref&gt;''The NIV study bible, new international version''; English (UK) edition; London, Hodder &amp; Stoughton, 1987; p.1817.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other than this, there are no known surviving texts attributed to Apollos.  There is little evidence for the suggestion that he might have written the [[Gospel of Matthew]] while in Ephesus or Achaea to stimulate Jewish conversion.  If Apollos did write it, it could have been influenced by the [[Gospel of Mark]] and written in the 60s or 70s AD.

Apollos is regarded as a saint by several Christian churches, including the [[Lutheran Church - Missouri Synod]], which hold a commemoration for him, [[Aquila (bible)|Aquila]] and [[Priscilla (Christian)|Priscilla]] on February 13.

{{Politics of the European Union}}

The '''Community acquis'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://eurovoc.europa.eu/210682 EuroVoc: Community acquis]&lt;/ref&gt; or '''acquis communautaire''' ({{IPA-en|ˈækiː kəˈmjuːnətɛər}}, {{IPA-fr|aki kɔmynotɛr|lang}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Collins&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=acquis communautaire |publisher=dictionary.com |author=Collins English Dictionary |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/acquis+communautaire |accessdate=18 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;), sometimes called the '''EU acquis''', and often shortened to '''acquis''',&lt;ref name=&quot;Collins&quot;/&gt; is the accumulated legislation, legal acts, court decisions which constitute the body of [[European Union law]]. The term is [[French language|French]]: ''acquis'' meaning &quot;that which has been acquired&quot;, and ''communautaire'' meaning &quot;of the community&quot;.

==Chapters of the acquis==
During the process of the [[enlargement of the European Union]], the acquis was divided into 31 chapters for the purpose of negotiation between the EU and the candidate member states for the fifth enlargement (the ten that joined in 2004 plus [[Romania]] and [[Bulgaria]] which joined in 2007). These chapters were:

{|

#[[Freedom to provide services]]
#[[Free movement of capital]]

#[[Taxation]]
#[[Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union|Economic and Monetary Union]]

&lt;li&gt;Financial control
&lt;li&gt;Financial and budgetary provisions
&lt;li&gt;Institutions
&lt;li&gt;Others
&lt;/ol&gt;
|}

For the negotiations with [[Croatia]] and [[Turkey]], the acquis was split up into 35 chapters instead, with the purpose of better balancing between the chapters: dividing the most difficult ones into separate chapters for easier negotiation, uniting some easier chapters, moving some policies between chapters, as well as renaming a few of them in the process:

Such negotiations usually involved agreeing transitional periods before new member states needed to implement the laws of the European Union fully and before they and their citizens acquired full rights under the ''acquis''.

==Other uses of the word ''acquis''==
The term ''acquis'' is also used to describe laws adopted under the [[Schengen Agreement]], prior to its integration into the European Union legal order by the [[Treaty of Amsterdam]], in which case one speaks of the ''Schengen acquis''.

The term ''acquis'' has been borrowed by the [[World Trade Organization]] Appellate Body, in the case ''Japan &amp;ndash; Taxes on Alcoholic Beverages'', to refer to the accumulation of [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT) and WTO law (&quot;''acquis gattien''&quot;), though this usage is not well established.

It has been used to describe the achievements of the [[Council of Europe]] (an international organisation unconnected with the European Union):&lt;ref&gt;Section 12, Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe Resolution 1290&lt;/ref&gt;
:The Council of Europe’s ''acquis'' in standard setting activities in the fields of [[democracy]], the [[rule of law]] and fundamental [[human rights]] and freedoms should be considered as milestones towards the great European political project, and the [[European Court of Human Rights]] should be recognised as the pre-eminent judicial pillar of any future architecture.

It has also been applied to the body of &quot;principles, norms and commitments&quot; of the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCE):&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osce.org/documents/sg/2004/06/3241_en.pdf Intervention by Ambassador Aleksi Härkönen, Permanent Representative of Finland to the OSCE], Annual Security Review Conference.
&lt;/ref&gt;

:Another question under debate has been how the Partners and others could implement the OSCE acquis, in other words its principles, norms and commitments on a voluntary basis.

The [[Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development]] (OECD) introduced the concept of the OECD Acquis in its &quot;[http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/63/6/32036418.pdf Strategy for enlargement and outreach]&quot;, May 2004.

{{Wiktionary|antacid}} 
[[Image:Antacid-L478.jpg|thumb|A bottle of antacid tablets]]
An '''antacid''' is a substance which [[neutralization (chemistry)|neutralizes]] [[gastric acid|stomach acidity]]. 

==Mechanism of action==
Antacids perform a neutralization reaction, increasing the [[pH]] to reduce acidity in the stomach. When gastric [[hydrochloric acid]] reaches the [[nerves]] in the gastrointestinal [[mucosa]], they [[Nociception|signal pain]] to the central nervous system. This happens when these nerves are exposed, as in [[peptic ulcer]]s.

==Indications==
[[Image:Old aluminum tablets.JPG|200px|left|thumb|Wyeth amphojel tablets of aluminum hydroxide.]]
Antacids are taken by mouth to relieve [[heartburn]], the major symptom of [[gastroesophageal reflux disease]], or [[acid indigestion]]. Treatment with antacids alone is symptomatic and only justified for minor symptoms. The treatment of ulcers may require [[H2-receptor antagonist]]s , [[proton pump inhibitor]]s and eradication of ''H. pylori''.

==Side effects==
Excess [[calcium]] from supplements, fortified food and high-calcium diets, can cause the [[milk-alkali syndrome]], which has serious toxicity and can be fatal. In 1915, Bertram Sippy introduced the &quot;Sippy regimen&quot; of hourly ingestion of milk and cream, the gradual addition of eggs and cooked cereal, for 10 days, combined with alkaline powders, which provided symptomatic relief for peptic ulcer disease. Over the next several decades, the Sippy regimen resulted in [[renal failure]], [[alkalosis]], and [[hypercalcaemia]]{{Clarify|calcemia or kalemia?|date=April 2010}}, mostly in men with peptic ulcer disease. These adverse effects were reversed when the regimen stopped, but it was fatal in some patients with protracted vomiting. Milk alkali syndrome declined in men after effective treatments were developed for peptic ulcer disease. But during the past 15 years, it has been reported in women taking calcium supplements above the recommended range of 1200 to 1500&amp;nbsp;mg daily, for prevention and treatment of [[osteoporosis]], and is exacerbated by dehydration. Calcium has been added to over-the-counter products, which contributes to inadvertent excessive intake.
The [[New England Journal of Medicine]] reported a typical case of a woman who arrived in the emergency department vomiting and in altered mental status, writhing in pain. She had consumed large quantities of chewable antacid tablets containing calcium carbonate. She gradually recovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

 | accessdate=2008-05-29
 | doi=10.1056/NEJMcps0706188
 | pmid=18450607 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compounds containing calcium may also increase calcium output in the urine, which might be associated with [[kidney stones]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

 | title=Antacid-induced osteomalacia and nephrolithiasis
 | journal=Archives of Internal Medicine }}&lt;/ref&gt; Calcium salts may cause [[constipation]].

Other adverse effects from antacids include: 
*''[[Carbonate]]'': regular high doses may cause [[alkalosis]], which in turn may result in altered excretion of other drugs, and kidney stones. A chemical reaction between the carbonate and hydrochloric acid may produce carbon dioxide gas. This causes gastric distension which may not be well tolerated. Carbon dioxide formation can also lead to headaches and decreased muscle flexibility. 
*''[[Aluminum hydroxide]]'': may lead to the formation of insoluble aluminium-phosphate-complexes, with a risk for [[hypophosphatemia]] and [[osteomalacia]]. Although [[aluminium]] has a low gastrointestinal absorption, accumulation may occur mainly in the presence of [[renal insufficiency]]. Aluminium-containing drugs often  cause [[constipation]] and are neurotoxic. Aluminium-containing drugs are contraindicated in pregnancy.
*''[[Magnesium hydroxide]]'': has [[laxative]] properties. Magnesium may accumulate in patients with [[renal failure]] leading to [[hypermagnesemia]], with cardiovascular and neurological complications. See [[Milk of magnesia]].
*''Sodium'': increased intake of sodium may be deleterious for [[arterial hypertension]], [[heart failure]] and many renal diseases.

Side effects from antacids vary depending on individual and other medications they may be taking at the time. Those who experience side effects most commonly suffer from changes in bowel functions, such as diarrhea, constipation, or flatulence.

Although reactions to any drug may vary from person to person, generally those medications that contain aluminum or calcium are the likeliest to cause constipation, those that contain magnesium are the likeliest to cause diarrhea. Some products combine these ingredients, which essentially cancels them out, to forestall unpleasant side effects.

==Additional information==
Heartburn, reflux, indigestion, and sour stomach are a few of the common terms used to describe digestive upset. Self-diagnosis of indigestion does carry some risk because the causes can vary from a minor dietary indiscretion to a peptic ulcer. The pain and symptoms of gastric esophageal reflux disease, GERD or simply &quot;reflux&quot;, may mimic those of a heart attack. Misdiagnosis can be fatal. A bleeding ulcer can be life threatening. GERD, and pre-ulcerative conditions in the stomach are treated much more aggressively since both, if untreated, could lead to esophageal or stomach cancer. It is primarily for this reason that the histamine-2 (H2) blockers including cimetidine (Tagamet), famotidine (Pepcid), and ranitidine (Zantac), and the proton pump inhibitors (PPI) omeprazole (Prilosec) and it's active isomer esomeprazole (Nexium) were made OTC. (Cimetidine is not a drug of choice now, because of many drug interactions and side effects). These drugs stop production of stomach acid and provide longer lasting relief but they do not neutralize any stomach acid already present in the stomach. For example, Pepcid Complete includes calcium carbonate in its formulation so it can claim instant relief.

==Interactions==
Altered pH or complex formation may alter the [[bioavailability]] of other drugs, such as [[tetracycline]] and [[amphetamine]]. Urinary excretion of certain drugs may also be affected. Chelation  of tetracycline with aluminium hydroxide can cause nausea, vomiting, and phosphate excretion, and cause phosphate deficiency.

==Problems with reduced stomach acidity==
Reduced stomach acidity may result in an impaired ability to [[Digestion|digest]] and absorb certain [[nutrient]]s, such as [[iron]] and the [[Vitamin B|B vitamins]]. Since the low pH of the stomach normally kills ingested bacteria, antacids increase the vulnerability to infection. It could also result in reduced bioavailability of some drugs. For example, the bioavailability of [[ketoconazole]] (antifungal) is reduced at high intragastric pH (low acid content).

An '''anti-diarrhoeal drug''' (or '''anti-diarrheal drug''') is any [[medication]] which provides symptomatic relief for [[diarrhea|diarrhoea]].

==Types==
* [[Electrolyte]] solutions are used to replace lost fluids and [[salt]]s in acute cases. 
* [[Bulking agent]]s like [[methylcellulose]], [[guar gum]] or plant [[dietary fiber|fibre]] ([[bran]], [[sterculia]], [[Psyllium seed husks|isabgol]], etc.) are used for diarrhoea in functional bowel disease and to control [[ileostomy]] output. 
* [[Absorption (chemistry)|Absorbent]]s absorb toxic substances that cause infective diarrhoea, methylcellulose is an absorbent.
* [[Anti-inflammatory]] solutions like [[Bismuth subsalicylate]]. 
* [[Opioid]]s' classical use besides pain relief is as an anti-diarrhoeal drug. Opioids have [[agonist]] actions on the intestinal opioid receptors, which when activated cause [[constipation]]. Drugs such as [[morphine]] or [[codeine]] can be used to relieve diarrhoea this way. A notable opioid for the purpose of relief of diarrhoea is [[Loperamide]] which only is an agonist of the [[mu Opioid receptor|μ opioid receptor]]s in the large intestine and does not have opioid affects in the [[central nervous system]] as it doesn't cross the [[blood-brain barrier]] in significant amounts. This enables loperamide to be used to the same benefit as other opioid drugs but without the CNS side effects or potential for abuse.

'''Áed mac Cináeda''' (died 878) was a son of [[Cináed mac Ailpín]] (&quot;Kenneth MacAlpin&quot;). He became king of the [[Picts]] in 877 when he succeeded his brother [[Constantín mac Cináeda]]. He was nicknamed '''Áed of the White Flowers''', '''the Wing-footed''' ({{lang-la|alipes}}) or '''the white-foot''' ({{lang-la|albipes}}).

The ''[[Chronicle of the Kings of Alba]]'' says of Áed: &quot;Edus [Áed] held the same [i.e. the kingdom] for one year. The shortness of his reign has bequeathed nothing memorable to history. He was slain in the civitas of Nrurim.&quot; Nrurim is unidentified.

The [[Annals of Ulster]] say that in 878: &quot;Áed mac Cináeda, king of the Picts, was killed by his associates.&quot; Tradition, reported by [[George Chalmers]] in his ''Caledonia'' (1807), and by the [[Statistical Accounts of Scotland|New Statistical Account]] (1834&amp;ndash;1845), has it that the early-historic mound of the Cunninghillock by [[Inverurie]] is the burial place of Áed. This is based on reading Nrurim as ''Inruriu''.

A longer account is interpolated in [[Andrew of Wyntoun]]'s ''Orygynale Cronykil of Scotland''. This says that Áed reigned one year and was killed by his successor [[Giric]] in [[Strathallan]] and other king lists have the same report.

It is uncertain which, if any, of the ''[[Prophecy of Berchán]]'''s kings should be taken to be Áed. [[William Forbes Skene]] presumed that the following verses referred to Áed:&lt;blockquote&gt;129. Another king will take [sovereignty]; small is the profit that he does not divide. Alas for Scotland thenceforward. His name will be the Furious.&lt;br&gt;130. He will be but a short time over Scotland. The will be no [word uncertain] unplundered. Alas for Scotland, through the youth; alas for their books, alas for their bequests.&lt;br&gt;131. He will be nine years in the kingdom. I shall tell you&amp;mdash;it will be a tale of truth&amp;mdash;he dies without bell, with communion, at evening, in a fatal pass.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Áed's son, [[Constantín mac Áeda]], became king in 900. The idea that [[Domnall II of Strathclyde]] was a son of Áed, based on a confusing entry in the Chronicle of the Kings of Alba, is contested.

'''Abdülhamid I''', '''Abdul Hamid I''' or '''Abd Al-Hamid I''' ([[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]]: عبد الحميد اول ''`Abdü’l-Ḥamīd-i evvel''), which translates to '''the Servant of God''' (March 20, 1725 &amp;ndash; April 7, 1789), was the 27th [[Sultan]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. He was the son of sultan [[Ahmed III]] (1703&amp;ndash;30) and succeeded his brother [[Mustafa III]] (1757–74) on January 21, 1774. He was born in [[Constantinople]]. His mother was [[Rabia Sharmi|Râbi'a Sharmi Sultana]].

==Imprisonment==
Abdülhamid was imprisoned for most of the first forty-two years of his life by his cousins [[Mahmud I]] and [[Osman III]] and his older brother Mustafa III, as was custom. He received his early education from his mother [[Rabia Sharmi|Râbi'a Sharmi Sultana]], from whom he studied history and learned [[calligraphy]].

His imprisonment made him aloof in regard to state affairs and malleable to the designs of his advisors. Yet he was also very religious and a [[pacifism|pacifist]] by nature. At his accession the financial straits of the treasury were such that the usual donative could not be given to the [[Janissary|janissaries]].  War was, however, forced on him and less than a year after his accession the complete defeat of the [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]] at [[Battle of Kozluja]] led to the humiliating ''[[treaty of Kuchuk-Kainarji|Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca]]'' on July 21, 1774.

In spite of his failures, Abdülhamid was regarded as the most gracious Sultan of the Ottomans. He administrated the [[fire brigade]] during the fire in 1782. In Constantinople, he won the admiration of his people as he was so religious that he was called a &quot;Veli&quot; (saint). He also traced a reform policy, followed the governmental administrations closely and worked with statesmen. When Abdülhamid came to the throne the army asked for gratuities and the sultan claimed that: &quot;There are, no longer, gratuities in our treasury, all of our soldier sons should learn&quot;. He also began the restoration of the military system. He is credited with better education standards. He tried to renovate the Janissary corps and the naval forces. He established a new artillery troop. He made a census in the Janissary corps.

Slight successes against rebellious outbreaks in [[Syria]] and the [[Morea]] could not compensate for the loss of the [[Crimea]] which Russia greatly coveted. War was once more declared against Russia in 1787 and in the following year Russians were joined by [[Austria]]. The Swedes and Prussians joined the conflict on the side of the Ottomans, but provided no assistance. While the Ottomans held their own in the conflict they ultimately lost with [[Ochakov]] falling in 1788 to the Russians (all of its inhabitants being massacred.)

Abdülhamid died four months later at the age of sixty-four in Constantinople. He was buried in Bahcekapi, a tomb he had built for himself.

==Family==
[[File:Abdülhamid I by John Young.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Abdul Hamid I in his royal robes.]]
His wives were: Valide Sultan [[Ayse Seniyeperver]], Valide Sultan [[Naksh-i-Dil Haseki]] Sultan (there have been speculations that she was a cousin of [[Napoleon]]'s wife [[Joséphine de Beauharnais|Josephine]];&lt;ref&gt;Christine Isom-Verhaaren, &quot;Royal French Women in the Ottoman Sultans' Harem: The Political Uses of Fabricated Accounts from the Sixteenth to the Twenty-first Century&quot;, ''[[Journal of World History]]'', vol. 17, No. 2, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; see [[Aimée du Buc de Rivéry]]), Hatice Ruh-shah, Huma Shah, Ayse, Binnaz, Dilpezir, Mehtabe, Misl-i Na-yab, Mu'teber, Fatma Sheb-SafaNevres and Mihriban. His concubines were: Nukhet-seza Hanimefendi: First [[concubine]]; Ayse Hanımefendi: Second concubine.

His sons were: [[Mustafa IV]] (1807–08) (his son by [[Ayse Seniyeperver]]), [[Mahmud II]] (1808–39) (his son by [[Naksh-i-Dil Haseki]]), Murad, Nusret, Mehmed, Ahmed, and Suleyman. 

His daughters were: [[Esma Sultana (1778-1848)|Esma]], Emine, Rabia, Saliha, Alimsah, Durusehvar, Fatma, Meliksah, Hibetullah and Zekiye Sultans.

'''Abdur Rahman Khan''' ({{lang-ps|عبد رحمان خان}}) (b. between 1840 to 1844 – d. October 1, 1901)&lt;ref&gt;However, his year of birth is given as 1830 in [[Chambers Biographical Dictionary]], ISBN 0-550-18022-2, page 2&lt;/ref&gt; was [[List of leaders of Afghanistan|Emir of Afghanistan]] from 1880 to 1901. 

The third son of [[Mohammad Afzal Khan]], and grandson of [[Dost Mohammad Khan]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kosmix.com/topic/abdur_rahman_khan Kosmix.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Abdur Rehman Khan was considered a strong ruler who re-established the writ of the Afghan government in [[Kabul]] after the disarray that followed the [[Second Anglo-Afghan War|second Anglo-Afghan war]].

==Background and early career==
Before his death in [[Herat]], on June 9, 1863, Dost Mohammad Khan had nominated as his successor [[Sher Ali Khan]], his third son, passing over the two elder brothers, [[Mohammad Afzal Khan|Afzal Khan]] and Azam Khan. At first, the new Amir was quietly recognized. But after a few months Afzal Khan raised an insurrection in the north of the country, where he had been governing when his father died. This began a fierce contest for power between Dost Mohammad's sons, which lasted for nearly five years.

In this war, Abdur Rahman became distinguished for ability and daring energy. Although his father, Afzal Khan, who had none of these qualities, came to terms with the Amir Sher Ali, the son's behavior in the northern province soon excited the Amir's suspicion, and Abdur Rahman, when he was summoned to Kabul, fled across the [[Oxus]] into [[Bukhara]]. Sher Ali threw Afzal Khan into prison, and a serious revolt followed in southern Afghanistan. 

The Amir had scarcely suppressed it by winning a desperate battle when Abdur Rahman's reappearance in the north was a signal for a mutiny of the troops stationed in those parts and a gathering of armed bands to his standard. After some delay and desultory fighting, he and his uncle, Azam Khan, occupied Kabul (March 1866). The Amir Sher Ali marched up against them from [[Kandahar]]; but in the battle that ensued at Sheikhabad on May 10, he was deserted by a large body of his troops, and after his signal defeat Abdur Rahman released his father, Afzul Khan, from prison in [[Ghazni]], and installed him upon the throne as Amir of Afghanistan. 

Notwithstanding the new Amir 's incapacity, and some jealousy between the real leaders, Abdur Rahman and his uncle, they again routed Sher Ali's forces, and occupied Kandahar in 1867. When Afzal Khan died at the end of the year, Azam Khan became the new ruler, with Abdur Rahman as his governor in the northern province. But towards the end of 1868 Sher Ali's return, and a general rising in his favour, resulted in Abdur Rahman and Azam Khan's defeat at ''Tinah Khan'' on January 3, 1869. Both sought refuge in [[Iran|Persia]], whence Abdur Rahman placed himself under [[Russia]]n protection at [[Samarkand]]. Azam died in Persia in October 1869.

==Period of exile==
Abdur Rahman lived in exile in [[Tashkent]], then part of [[Russian Turkestan]], for eleven years, until the 1879 death of Sher Ali, who had retired from Kabul when the [[United Kingdom|British]] armies entered Afghanistan. The Russian [[Governor-General|governor-general]] at Tashkent sent for Abdur Rahman, and pressed him to try his fortunes once more across the Oxus. In March 1880, a report reached India that Abdur Rahman was in northern Afghanistan; and the governor-general, [[Robert Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Earl of Lytton|Lord Lytton]], opened communications with him to the effect that the [[Her Majesty's Government|British government]] were prepared to withdraw their troops, and to recognize Abdur Rahman as Amir of Afghanistan, with the exception of Kandahar and some districts adjacent to it. After some negotiations, an interview took place between him and [[Lepel Griffin]], the diplomatic representative at Kabul of the [[India]]n government. Griffin described Abdur Rahman as a man of middle height, with an exceedingly intelligent face and frank and courteous manners, shrewd and able in conversation on the business in hand.

==Reign==
At the ''[[Durbar (court)|durbar]]'' on July 22, 1880, Abdur Rahman was officially recognized as Amir, granted assistance in arms and money, and promised, in case of unprovoked foreign aggression, such further aid as might be necessary to repel it, provided that he align his foreign policy with the British. The British evacuation of Afghanistan was settled on the terms proposed, and in 1881, the [[British Army|British troops]] also handed over Kandahar to the new ''Amir''. [[File:Abdur Rahman Khan.jpg|left|thumb|Abdur Rahman Khan in 1897]]

However, [[Ayub Khan (Afghan commander)|Ayub Khan]], one of Sher Ali Khan's sons, marched upon that city from Herat, defeated Abdur Rahman's troops, and occupied the place in July 1880. This serious reverse roused the ''Amir'', who had not at first displayed much activity. He led a force from Kabul, met Ayub's army close to Kandahar, and the complete victory which he there won forced Ayub Khan to fly into Persia. From that time Abdur Rahman was fairly seated on the throne at Kabul, and in the course of the next few years he consolidated his dominion over all Afghanistan, suppressing [[insurrection]]s by a sharp and relentless use of his [[Despotism|despotic]] authority. The powerful [[Ghilzai]] tribe revolted against the severity of his measures several times. In that same year, Ayub Khan made a fruitless inroad from Persia. In 1888, the Amir's cousin, Ishak Khan, rebelled against him in the north; but these two enterprises came to nothing. 

In 1885, at the moment when the ''Amir'' was in conference with the British [[viceroy]], [[Frederick Hamilton-Temple-Blackwood, 1st Marquess of Dufferin and Ava|Lord Dufferin]], in India, the news came of a skirmish between Russian and Afghan troops at [[Panjdeh]], over a disputed point in the demarcation of the northwestern frontier of Afghanistan. Abdur Rahman's attitude at this critical juncture is a good example of his political sagacity. To one who had been a man of war from his youth, who had won and lost many fights, the rout of a detachment and the forcible seizure of some debatable frontier lands was an untoward incident; but it was not a [[Principle of sufficient reason|sufficient reason]] for calling upon the British, although they had guaranteed his territory's integrity, to vindicate his rights by hostilities which would certainly bring upon him a Russian invasion from the north, and would compel his British allies to throw an army into Afghanistan from the southeast. 

His interest lay in keeping powerful neighbours, whether friends or foes, outside his kingdom. He knew this to be the only policy that would be supported by the Afghan nation; and although for some time a rupture with Russia seemed imminent, while the [[India Office|Government of India]] made ready for that contingency, the Amir's reserved and circumspect tone in the consultations with him helped to turn the balance between peace and war, and substantially conduced towards a pacific solution. Abdur Rahman left on those who met him in India the impression of a clear-headed man of action, with great self-reliance and hardihood, not without indications of the implacable severity that too often marked his administration. His investment with the insignia of the highest grade of the [[Order of the Star of India]] appeared to give him much pleasure. 

From the end of 1888, the Amir spent eighteen months in his northern provinces bordering upon the Oxus, where he was engaged in pacifying the country that had been disturbed by revolts, and in punishing with a heavy hand all who were known or suspected to have taken any part in rebellion. &lt;!--  Commented out: [[File:Hazaraslave.jpg|thumb|Hazara prisoners in Amir's Court making a plea and answering to charges.]] --&gt;

Shortly afterwards (in 1892) he succeeded in finally beating down the resistance of the [[Hazara people]], who vainly attempted to defend their independence, within their highlands, of the central authority at Kabul. In the late 1880s many of the Hazara tribes revolted against Abdur Rahman, the first ruler to bring the country of Afghanistan under a centralized Afghan government. Consequent on this unsuccessful revolt, numbers of Hazaras fled to [[Quetta]] in [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]],to the area around [[Mashhed]] in northeastern Iran, Russia, Iraq, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan,China and India. Most active in the revolt were the [[Uruzgan]]i, the southernmost of the Hazara tribes. Following their defeat, a considerable number of Uruzgani left the country, as did many [[Jaghuri]], their nearest neighbors to the northeast. 

In the Shikhali district an estimated 7,000 head of cattle were taken away from Hazaras and 350 men and women of the [[Jaghori]] district had been sold at Kabul markets each at the price of 20–21 Afs. Abdur Rahman's brutal suppression compelled a large number of Hazaras to seek refuge in Iran, India, and Russia. Abdur Rahman could only succeed in subjugating Hazaras and conquering their land when he effectively utilized internal differences within the Hazara community, co-opting sold-out Hazara chiefs into his bureaucratic sales of the enslaved Hazara men, women and children in 1897, the Hazaras remained [[de facto]] slaves until King [[Amanullah Khan]] declared Afghanistan's independence in 1919.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://boozers.fortunecity.com/jerusalem/47/Political_Role/political_role.html#2 More on Persecution by Abdur Rehman]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1895, the Amir found himself unable, by reason of [[Illness|ill-health]], to accept an invitation from [[Queen Victoria]] to visit England; but his second son [[Nasrullah Khan (Afghanistan)|Nasrullah Khan]] went instead. [[File:Amir Abdurahman Khan's Tomb.jpg|thumb|Site of Amir Abdur Rahman Khan's tomb, located in [[Kabul]].]]

Abdur Rahman died on October 1, 1901, being succeeded by his son [[Habibullah Khan]]. He had defeated all enterprises by rivals against his throne; he had broken down the power of local chiefs, and tamed the refractory tribes; so that his orders were irresistible throughout the whole dominion. His government was a military despotism resting upon a well-appointed army; it was administered through officials absolutely subservient to an inflexible will and controlled by a widespread system of [[espionage]]; while the exercise of his personal authority was too often stained by acts of unnecessary cruelty. 

He held open courts for the receipt of petitioners and the dispensation of justice; and in the disposal of business he was indefatigable. He succeeded in imposing an organized government upon the fiercest and most unruly population in [[Asia]]; he availed himself of [[Europe]]an inventions for strengthening his armament, while he sternly set his face against all innovations which, like [[Railway]]s and [[Telegraphy|Telegraph]]s, might give Europeans a foothold within his country. 

His adventurous life, his forcible character, the position of his state as a barrier between the Indian and the Russian empires, and the skill with which he held the balance in dealing with them, combined to make him a prominent figure in contemporary Asian politics and will mark his reign as an epoch in the history of Afghanistan. The Amir received an annual Subsidy from the British government of 1,850,000 [[rupee]]s. He was allowed to import munitions of war. 

In 1896, he adopted the title of ''Zia-ul-Millat-Wa-ud Din'' (&quot;Light of the nation and religion&quot;); and his zeal for the cause of [[Islam]] induced him to publish [[treatises]] on ''[[jihad]]''. Today, his descendants can be found in many places outside of Afghanistan, such as in America, [[France]], [[Germany]], and carry the surname of ''Ziyaee'', which is itself a derivative of the King's title. His two eldest sons, Habibullah Khan and [[Nasrullah Khan (Afghanistan)|Nasrullah Khan]], were born at [[Samarkand]]. His youngest son, Mahomed Omar Jan, was born in 1889 of an Afghan mother, connected by descent with the [[Barakzai]] family.

==Durand Line==
{{See also|Durand Line}}
In 1893 [[Mortimer Durand]] negotiated with Abdur Rahman Khan, the ''Durand Line Treaty'' for the demarcation of the frontier between Afghanistan, the [[FATA]], [[North-West Frontier Province]] and [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Baluchistan]] Provinces of Pakistan the successor state of [[British India]]. This line, the [[Durand Line]], is named after Mortimer Durand and which still remains as an unrecognized boundary by the Government of Afghanistan.

In 1893, Mortimer Durand was deputed to Kabul by the government of British India for this purpose of settling an exchange of territory required by the demarcation of the boundary between northeastern Afghanistan and the Russian possessions, and in order to discuss with  Amir Abdur Rahman Khan other pending questions. Abdur Rahman Khan showed his usual ability in diplomatic argument, his tenacity where his own views or claims were in debate, with a sure underlying insight into the real situation. 

In the agreement, the relations between the British Indian and Afghan governments, as previously arranged, were confirmed; and an understanding was reached upon the important and difficult subject of the border line of Afghanistan on the east, towards India. 

In the year 1893, during rule of Amir Abdur Rahman Khan, a Royal Commission for setting up of Boundary between Afghanistan and British Governed India was set up to negotiate terms with the British, for the agreeing to the Durand line, and the two parties camped at [[Parachinar]], now part of FATA Pakistan, which is near [[Khost]], Afghanistan. From the British side the camp was attended by Mortimer Durand and [[Sahibzada Abdul Qayyum]], [[Political Agent]] [[Khyber]]. Afghanistan was represented by [[Sahibzada Abdul Latif]] and the Governor [[Sardar Shireendil Khan]] representing Amir Abdur Rahman Khan. He is to be told the greatest king in afghanish history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaiil.org/aaiil/ra/jalsa/2003/sahibzadaabdullatifshaheed100anniversary/08sahibzadazahoorahmad_sahibzadaabdullatifshaheed.mp3 AAIIL.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Abencerrages''' (from the Arabic for &quot;Saddler's Son&quot;),&lt;ref name=&quot;CBD&quot;&gt;[[Chambers Biographical Dictionary]], ISBN 0-550-18022-2, page 3&lt;/ref&gt; were a family or faction that is said to have held a prominent position in the [[Moorish]] [[kingdom of Granada]] in the 15th century.

The name appears to have been derived from the Yussuf ben-Serragh, the head of the tribe in the time of [[Mohammed VII of Granada, al-Mustain]], who did that sovereign good service in his struggles to retain the crown of which he was three times deprived.

Little is known of the family with certainty; the [[Chambers Biographical Dictionary]] records that they arrived in Spain in the 8th century&lt;ref name=&quot;CBD&quot; /&gt; but the name is familiar from the romance by [[Gines Perez de Hita|Ginés Perez de Hita]], ''Guerras civiles de Granada'', which celebrates the feuds of the Abencerrages and the rival family of the Zegris, and the cruel treatment to which the former were subjected. [[Jean-Pierre Claris de Florian|J. P. de Florian]]'s ''Gonsalve de Cordoue'' and [[François-René de Chateaubriand|Châteaubriand]]'s ''Le dernier des Abencerrages'' are imitations of Perez de Hita's work.

The story is told that one of the Abencerrages, having fallen in love with a lady of the royal family, was caught in the act of climbing up to her window. The king, enraged, shut up the whole family in one of the halls of the [[Alhambra]], and ordered the Zergis to kill them all. The apartment where this is to have taken place is one of the most beautiful courts of the Alhambra, and is still called the Hall of the Abencerrages. 

Many poems and plays, and one opera (''[[Les Abencérages]]'', by [[Luigi Cherubini]])&lt;ref&gt;''Zelmar ou L'asile; ou, Les Abencerages'' a drame lyriqueby [[André J. Grétry]], composed in 1801, remained unperformed.&lt;/ref&gt; mention the legend, but the whole story is doubtful, because the best historians do not mention it.

'''Abercarn''' is a small [[town]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/423423 Gwyddon Road, Abercarn:: OS grid ST2194 :: Geograph British Isles - photograph every grid square!&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Community council|community]] in [[Caerphilly (county borough)|Caerphilly county borough]], [[Wales]], 10 miles (16&amp;nbsp;km) north-west of [[Newport]] on the A467 between [[Cwmcarn]] and [[Newbridge, Caerphilly|Newbridge]], within the [[Historic counties of Wales|historic boundaries]] of [[Monmouthshire (historic)|Monmouthshire]]. 

==History==
The district was traditionally associated with the [[coal mining]] collieries, [[ironworks]] and [[tinplate]] works of the [[South Wales coalfield]] and [[South Wales Valleys]], although all have now &lt;span style=&quot;white-space:nowrap;&quot;&gt;closed;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/199469 Post Office: Abercarn Royal Mail Sorting Office:: OS grid ST2194 :: Geograph British Isles - photograph every grid square!&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/span&gt; the town, which lies in the middle portion of the [[Ebbw River|Ebbw]] valley, being situated on the south-eastern flank of the once great mining region of [[Glamorgan]] and [[Monmouthshire]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/423436 Jamesville, Abercarn:: OS grid ST2193 :: Geograph British Isles - photograph every grid square!&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 September 1878 it was the site of an underground [[explosion]] which killed 268 [[coal miner]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Abercarn Colliery|url=http://www.welshcoalmines.co.uk/Gwent/Abercarn.htm|work=Welsh Coal Mines|accessdate=2010-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Abercarn, High Street.jpg|thumb|left|Abercarn High Street]]
==Local government==
The area was part of the ancient [[Monmouthshire (historic)|Monmouthshire]] [[parish]] of [[Mynyddislwyn]] until the late 19th century. In 1892 a [[local board of health]] and local government district of Abercarn was formed.&lt;ref&gt;Formed as Newbridge local board and local government district on March 17, 1892, renamed Abercarn on July 4 of the same year. County Census Report 1670, Monmouthshire&lt;/ref&gt; This became Abercarn urban district in 1894, governed by an urban district council of twelve members. Under the [[Local Government Act 1972]] the urban district was abolished in 1974, becoming part of the borough of [[Islwyn]], [[Gwent (county)|Gwent]]. Further local government organisation in 1996 placed the area in the county borough of Caerphilly. The former urban district corresponds to the three communities of Abercarn, [[Crumlin, Caerphilly|Crumlin]] and [[Newbridge, Caerphilly|Newbridge]].

==Sport==
Abercarn is home to [[Abercarn RFC|Abercarn Rugby Club]] which is a member of the Welsh Rugby Union.

'''Aberdare''' ({{lang-cy|Aberdâr}}) is an industrial [[town]] in [[Rhondda Cynon Taf]], [[Wales]], situated at the [[confluence]] of the Rivers Dar and [[River Cynon|Cynon]].  The population at the (1991) [[census]] was 31,619.  It is {{convert|4|mi}} south west of [[Merthyr Tydfil]] and {{convert|24|mi}} north west of [[Cardiff]].

==History==
From being, at the beginning of the 19th century, a mere [[village]] in an agricultural district, the place grew rapidly in population owing to the abundance of its [[coal]] and [[iron ore]], and the population of the whole [[parish]] (which was only 1,486 in 1801) increased tenfold during the first half of the 19th century.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{1911|inline=1|wikisource=Aberdare}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has since declined, owing to the loss of most of the heavy industry.

[[Ironworks]] were established at [[Llwydcoed]] and [[Abernant, Rhondda Cynon Taff|Abernant]] in 1799 and 1800 respectively, followed by others at Gadlys and [[Aberaman]] in 1827 and 1847. These have not been worked since about 1875. After this, the iron industry was represented only by a small [[tinplate]] works, but by this stage the economy of the town was dominated by the [[coal mining]] industry.  There were also several brickworks and breweries.  During the latter half of the 19th century, considerable public improvements were made to the town, which became, despite its neighbouring collieries, a pleasant place to live.  Its institutions included a post-graduate theological college (opened in connection with the Church of [[England]] in 1892, until 1907, when it was removed to [[Llandaff]]).&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;
[[File:Aberdare 1910s.jpg|thumb|left|Aberdare in the 1910s]]
Aberdare, with the ecclesiastical parishes of St Fagan's (Trecynon) and Aberaman carved out of the ancient parish, had twelve [[Anglican]] churches, one [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] church (built in 1866 in Monk Street near the site of a cell attached to [[Penrhys Abbey]]) and at one time had over fifty [[Nonconformist]] [[chapel]]s. The services in the majority of the chapels were in the [[Welsh language]].  The urban district includes what were once the separate villages of [[Aberaman]], [[Abernant, Aberdare|Abernant]], Cwmaman, [[Cwmbach]], [[Cwmdare]], [[Llwydcoed]], [[Penywaun]] and [[Trecynon]].  There are several [[cairn]]s and the remains of a circular [[Brython|British]] encampment on the mountain between Aberdare and [[Merthyr]]. [[Hirwaun]] moor, 4 miles to the north west of Aberdare, was according to tradition the scene of a battle at which [[Rhys ap Tewdwr]], prince of [[Dyfed]], was defeated by the allied forces of the [[Normans|Norman]] [[Robert Fitzhamon]] and [[Iestyn ap Gwrgant]], the last Welsh prince of [[Glamorgan]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

===The coal industry===
[[File:Aberdare Co-operative store fire, May 11th 1919.jpg|thumb|right|Aberdare Co-operative store fire, May 11th 1919]]
In the early years of Aberdare's development, most of the coal worked in the parish was coking coal, and was consumed locally, chiefly in the [[ironworks]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; In 1836, exploitation of the &quot;Four-foot Seam&quot; of high-[[heating value|calorific value]] [[steam coal]] began, and pits were sunk in rapid succession.  This coal was valuable for steam [[railway]]s and [[steam ship]]s, and an export trade began, via the [[Taff Vale Railway]] and the port of [[Cardiff]]. The population of the parish rose from 6,471 in 1841 to 14,999 in 1851 and 32,299 in 1861 and John Davies&lt;ref&gt;Davies, John, ''A History of Wales'', Penguin, 1994, ISBN 0-14-014581-8, p 400&lt;/ref&gt; described it as &quot;the most dynamic place in Wales&quot;. In 1851, the [[Admiralty]] decided to use Welsh steam coal in ships of the [[Royal Navy]], and this decision boosted the reputation of Aberdare's product and launched a huge international export market.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davies, ''op cit'', p 400&quot;&gt;Davies, ''op cit'', p 400&lt;/ref&gt; Coal mined in Aberdare parish rose from {{convert|177000|LT|t}} in 1844 to {{convert|477000|LT|t}} in 1850,&lt;ref&gt;Davies, ''op cit'', p 384&lt;/ref&gt; and the coal trade, which after 1875 was the chief support of the town, soon reached huge dimensions.  Steam coal was subsequently found in the [[Ystradyfodwg|Rhondda]] and further west, but many of the great companies of the Welsh coal industry's Gilded Age started operation in Aberdare and the lower Cynon Valley, including those of [[David Alfred Thomas, 1st Viscount Rhondda|Samuel Thomas]], [[David Davies (industrialist)|David Davies and Sons]], [[John Nixon (mining engineer)|Nixon's Navigation]] and [[Powell Duffryn]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Davies, ''op cit'', p 400&quot;/&gt; In common with the rest of the South Wales coalfield, Aberdare's coal industry commenced a long decline after [[World War I]], and the last two deep mines still in operation in the 1960s were the small Aberaman and Fforchaman collieries, which closed in 1962 and 1965 respectively.

On May 11, 1919, an extensive fire broke out on Cardiff Street, Aberdare.

==Culture==
[[File:CaradogStatueAberdare.jpg|thumb|left| [[Griffith Rhys Jones|Caradog]] statue in Victoria Square]]
Aberdare, during its boom years, was considered a centre of [[Welsh culture]]: it hosted the first [[National Eisteddfod]] in 1861, again in 1885, and in 1956 at [[Aberdare Park]] where the [[Gorsedd stones|Gorsedd standing stones]] still exist.

The [[Coliseum Theatre (Aberdare)|Coliseum Theatre]] is Aberdare's main [[arts]] venue, containing a 600-seat [[auditorium]] and [[movie theater|cinema]]. It is situated in nearby [[Trecynon]] and was built in 1938 using [[miner]]s' subscriptions.  

Aberdare was the birthplace of the [[World War II|Second World War]] poet [[Alun Lewis]], and a plaque commemorating him is to be found, including a quotation from his poem, ''The Mountain over Aberdare''.

The original founding members of the rock band [[Stereophonics]] originated from the nearby village of [[Cwmaman]].  It is also the hometown of guitarist [[Mark Parry (musician)|Mark Parry]] of Vancouver rock band [[The Manvils]].  Famed [[anarcho-punk|anarchist-punk]] band [[Crass]] played their last live show for striking miners in Aberdare during the [[UK miners' strike (1984-1985)]].

[[Griffith Rhys Jones|Griffith Rhys Jones - or Caradog]] as he was commonly known - was the Conductor of the famous 'Côr Mawr' of some 460 voices (the South Wales Choral Union), which twice won first prize at Crystal Palace choral competitions in London in the 1870s.  He is depicted in the town's most prominent statue by sculptor [[Sir William Goscombe John|Goscombe John]], unveiled on Victoria Square in 1920.

==Churches and chapels==

[[File:Aberdare St Elvan's church.jpg|thumb|right|‎ St Elvan's church]]
In the town centre is [[St Elvan]]'s Church. This is a [[Church in Wales]] church at the heart of the Parish of Aberdare. The church is over 200 years old and has had extensive work since its erection in the 1800s. The church also has a modern, two-manual and pedal board pipe organ that is still used in services.&lt;br /&gt;
The nearby St John the Baptist Church of the same parish is also notable as a 15th century building that is still used for regular services. It currently has only a small electric organ.
Also of the same parish is St. Matthew's Church in Abernant.
[[File:Aberdare St John the Baptist Church.jpg|thumb|left|St John the Baptist Church]]
In the Parish of Aberaman and Cwmaman is St. Margaret's Church with an old but beautiful pipe organ with two manuals and a pedal board. Also in this parish is St. Joseph's church, Cwmaman.

==In the media==
The [[Torchwood]] novel [[Almost Perfect (Torchwood)|Almost Perfect]] by [[James Goss (producer)|James Goss]] mentions a fictional [[Nuclear explosion|nuclear blast]] taking place in the town.

==Sports==
[[File:AberdareCarnival-AberdareBlog.jpg|thumb|right|Aberdare Carnival]]
[[Aberdare Athletic F.C.]] were members of the [[Football League]] between 1921 and 1927 before being replaced by [[Torquay United]] after finishing bottom. The club folded a year later. They played their games at the [[Aberdare Athletic Ground]].

[[Aberdare RFC|Aberdare Rugby Football Club]] are a [[rugby union]] team formed in 1890 which still play in Aberdare today at the Ynys Stadium.

The [[Aberdare Athletic Ground]] was also the venue of the first ever [[rugby league]] international played between [[Wales national rugby league team|Wales]] and the [[New Zealand national rugby league team#The All Golds|New Zealand All Golds]] on New Years Day 1908, which was won by the Welsh 9-8.

      <comment>/* Solar annual aberration */ an -&gt; a</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Stellar aberration.JPG|thumb |250px |Light from location 1 will appear to be coming from location 2 for a moving telescope due to the finite speed of light, a phenomenon known as the aberration of light.]]

The '''aberration of light''' (also referred to as '''astronomical aberration''' or '''stellar aberration''') is an astronomical phenomenon which produces an [[improper motion|apparent motion]] of celestial objects about their real locations. It was discovered and later explained by the third [[Astronomer Royal]], [[James Bradley]], in 1729, who attributed it to the finite [[speed of light]] and the motion of [[Earth]] in its orbit around the [[Sun]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hirshfeld&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Hirschfeld |first=Alan |authorlink= |title=Parallax:The Race to Measure the Cosmos |year=2001 |publisher=Henry Holt |location=New York, New York |isbn=0-8050-7133-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the instant of any observation of an object, the apparent position of the object is displaced from its true position by an amount which depends solely upon the transverse component of the [[velocity]] of the observer, with respect to the vector of the incoming beam of light (i.e., the line actually taken by the light on its path to the observer). The result is a tilting of the direction of the incoming light which is independent of the distance between object and observer.

In the case of an observer on Earth, the direction of a star's velocity varies during the year as Earth [[orbital revolution|revolves]] around the Sun (or strictly speaking, the [[barycenter]] of the [[solar system]]), and this in turn causes the apparent position of the star to vary. This particular effect is known as '''annual aberration''' or '''stellar aberration''', because it causes the apparent position of a star to vary periodically over the course of a year. The maximum amount of the aberrational displacement of a star is approximately 20 [[arcsecond]]s in [[right ascension]] or [[declination]]. Although this is a relatively small value, it was well within the observational capability of the instruments available in the early eighteenth century.

Aberration should not be confused with [[Parallax#Stellar parallax|stellar parallax]], although it was an initially fruitless search for parallax that first led to its discovery.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hirshfeld&quot;/&gt; Parallax is caused by a change in the position of the observer looking at a relatively nearby object, as measured against more distant objects, and is therefore dependent upon the distance between the observer and the object.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hirshfeld&quot;/&gt;

In contrast, stellar aberration is ''independent'' of the distance of a celestial object from the observer, and depends only on the observer's ''instantaneous transverse velocity'' with respect to the incoming light beam, at the moment of observation. The light beam from a distant object cannot itself have any transverse velocity component, or it could not (by definition) be seen by the observer, since it would miss the observer. Thus, any transverse velocity of the emitting source plays no part in aberration. Another way to state this is that the emitting object ''may'' have a transverse velocity with respect to the observer, but any light beam emitted from it which reaches the observer, cannot, for it must have been previously emitted in such a direction that its transverse component has been &quot;corrected&quot; for. Such a beam must come &quot;straight&quot; to the observer along a line which connects the observer with the position of the object when it emitted the light.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hirshfeld&quot;/&gt;

Aberration should also be distinguished from [[light-time correction]], which is due to the motion of the observed object, like a [[planet]], through space during the time taken by its light to reach an observer on Earth. Light-time correction depends upon the velocity and distance ''of the emitting object'' during the time it takes for its light to travel to Earth. Light-time correction does not depend on the motion of the Earth—it only depends on Earth's ''position'' at the instant when the light is observed. Aberration is usually larger than a planet's light-time correction except when the planet is near [[Quadrature (astronomy)|quadrature]] (90° from the Sun), where aberration drops to zero because then the Earth is directly approaching or receding from the planet. At [[opposition (astronomy)|opposition]] to or [[conjunction (astronomy and astrology)|conjunction]] with the Sun, aberration is 20.5&quot; while light-time correction varies from 4&quot; for [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] to 0.37&quot; for [[Neptune]] (the Sun's light-time correction is less than 0.03&quot;).

==Explanation==
It has been stated above that aberration causes a displacement of the apparent position of an object from its true position. However, it is important to understand the precise technical definition of these terms.

===Apparent and true positions===
[[File:Aberration1.svg|frame|right|Figure 1. Diagram illustrating stellar aberration]]
The '''apparent position''' of a star or other very distant object is the direction in which it is seen by an observer on the moving Earth. The '''true position''' (or '''geometric position''') is the direction of the straight line between the observer and star at the instant of observation. The difference between these two positions is caused by [[parallax]] and by aberration. When the star is a distant object, parallax is negligible and the difference is due mostly to aberration.

Aberration occurs when the observer's [[velocity]] has a component that is [[perpendicular]] to the line traveled by the light incoming from the star. Let us suppose (as is the practical case) that the star is sufficiently distant that all light from the star travels in parallel paths to the Earth observer, regardless of where the Earth is in its orbit. That is, there is zero parallax. On the left side of Figure 1, the case of infinite light speed is shown. '''S''' represents the '''s'''pot where the star light enters the telescope, and '''E''' the position of the '''e'''ye piece. If light moves instantaneously, the telescope does not move, and the true direction of the star relative to the observer can be found by following the line '''ES'''. However, if light travels at finite speed, the Earth, and therefore the eye piece of the telescope, moves from '''E''' to '''E’''' during the time it takes light to travel from '''S''' to '''E'''. Consequently, the star will no longer appear in the center of the eye piece. The telescope must therefore be adjusted. When the telescope is at position '''E''' it must be oriented toward spot '''S’''' so that the star light enters the telescope at spot '''S’'''. Now the star light will travel along the line '''S’E’''' (parallel to '''SE''')  and reach '''E’''' exactly when the moving eye piece also reaches '''E’'''. Since the telescope has been adjusted by the angle '''SES’''', the star's apparent position is hence displaced by the same angle.

===Moving in the rain===
Many find aberration to be counter-intuitive, and a simple thought experiment based on everyday experience can help in its understanding. Imagine you are standing in the rain. There is no wind, so the rain is falling vertically. To protect yourself from the rain you hold an umbrella directly above you.

Now imagine that you start to walk. Although the rain is still falling vertically (relative to a stationary observer), you find that you have to hold the umbrella slightly in front of you to keep off the rain. Because of your forward motion relative to the falling rain, the rain now appears to be falling not from directly above you, but from a point in the sky somewhat in front of you.

The deflection of the falling rain is greatly increased at higher speeds. When you drive a [[car]] at night through falling rain, the rain drops illuminated by your car's [[headlight]]s appear to (and actually do) fall from a position in the sky well in front of your car.

===Relative frame of reference===
According to the [[special theory of relativity]], the aberration only depends on the relative velocity ''v'' between the observer and the light from the star. The formula from [[relativistic aberration]] can be simplified to&lt;ref name=&quot;kassner&quot;&gt;{{cite arxiv |eprint=astro-ph/0203056 |title=Why the Bradley aberration cannot be used to measure absolute speeds. A comment |author1=Klaus Kassner |class=astro-ph |year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\tan{\frac{\theta^'}{2}} = \tan{\frac{\theta}{2}}\sqrt{\frac{c-v}{c+v}} &lt;/math&gt;

where ''θ'' is the true angle '''SEE’''', ''θ’'' is the apparent angle '''S’EE’''', and ''v'' is the relative speed between the starlight and the observer. Thus, the aberration of light does not imply an absolute frame of reference, as when one moves in the rain. The speed of the rain perceived in a running car is increased as it hits the windscreen more heavily. Instead, according to the special theory of relativity, the speed of light is constant and only its direction changes. The above formula accounts for that while the simpler ''tan(θ-θ’)=v/c'' does not.

In most cases the transverse velocity of the star is unknown. However, for some binary systems where a high rotating speed can be inferred, it doesn't cause an aberration as apparently implied by the relativity principle. As discussed above, aberration occurs because the observer moves relative to parallel beams of light coming from the star. In contrast to the case of the observer, the star moves with the divergent beams of light that it emits in all directions, and its motion just selects which one is destined to hit the observer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newtonphysics.on.ca/aberration/index.html |title=Stellar Aberration and Einstein's Relativity  |accessdate=2008-10-18 |author=Paul Marmet |year=1996 |work=Newton Physics}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, dependency on the source is paradoxical: Consider a second source of light that on a given instant coincides with the star, but is not at rest with it. Suppose that two rays of light reach the observer, one emitted by the star and the other by the second source in the instant when they coincide. If rays are straight, since they share two points (the coinciding sources and the observer) then they must coincide. However, since the velocities of the sources differ, the observer would see those rays coming from different directions, if aberration depended on the source's motion.&lt;ref&gt;The argument of two coincident sources in relative motion is attributed to prof. T. Gold of Cornell University, in {{cite web |url=http://scitation.aip.org/getabs/servlet/GetabsServlet?prog=normal&amp;id=AJPIAS000035000009000817000001&amp;idtype=cvips&amp;gifs=yes |title=Aberration of Light from Binary Stars—a Paradox? |accessdate=2008-10-20 |author=Edward Eisner |date=1966-12-12 |doi=10.1119/1.1974259}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the velocity of the star may be unknown, from the above formula one can derive the relation between the angles ''θ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''θ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' seen by two arbitrary observers moving with velocities ''v&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''v&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'', and then use the velocity addition theorem to subtract the unknown velocity ''w'' of the star in order to express ''v&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''v&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' relative to an arbitrary frame:&lt;ref name=&quot;kassner&quot;/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\tan{\frac{\theta_2}{2}} = \tan{\frac{\theta_1}{2}} \sqrt{\frac{(c-w)(c+v_1)\;(c+w)(c-v_2)}{(c+w)(c-v_1)\;(c-w)(c+v_2)}} = \tan{\frac{\theta_1}{2}} \sqrt{\frac{c-v_{21}}{c+v_{21}}}&lt;/math&gt;

Provided that the observers were actually looking at the same star and its velocity didn't change between their observations, the formula shows how ''w'' cancels out. Then, using again the velocity addition theorem to express the relative velocity of the two observers as &lt;math&gt;v_{21}=(v_2-v_1)/(1-v_1v_2/c^2)&lt;/math&gt; one finds the ''relative aberration''. It only uses the latter relative velocity and ''c'' to equate the angles observed in different frames of reference.

==Types of aberration==
There are a number of types of aberration, caused by the differing components of the Earth's motion:
* '''Annual aberration''' is due to the revolution of the Earth around the [[Sun]].
* '''Planetary aberration''' is the combination of aberration and light-time correction.
* '''Diurnal aberration''' is due to the [[rotation]] of the Earth about its own axis.
* '''Secular aberration''' is due to the motion of the Sun and [[solar system]] relative to other stars in the [[galaxy]].

===Annual aberration===

[[File:Aberration2.gif|thumb|250px|Figure 5. Diagram illustrating aberration of a star at the north ecliptic pole]]

Suppose a star is observed with a telescope idealized as a narrow tube. The light enters the tube from a star at angle ''θ'' and travels at speed ''c'' taking a time ''h/c'' to reach the bottom of the tube, where our eye detects the light. Suppose observations are made from Earth, which is moving with a speed ''v''. During the transit of the light, the tube moves a distance ''vh/c''. Consequently, for the photon to reach the bottom of the tube, the tube must be inclined at an angle ''φ'' different from ''θ'' , resulting in an ''apparent'' position of the star at angle ''φ''. As the Earth proceeds in its orbit, the velocity changes direction, so ''φ'' changes with the time of year the observation is made, allowing the [[speed of light]] to be determined. The two angles are related by the speed of light and the speed of the tube, but actually do not depend upon the length of the tube, as explained next. The apparent angle and true angle are related using trigonometry as:&lt;ref name=Mould&gt;{{cite book |title=Basic Relativity |page=8 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=lfGE-wyJYIUC&amp;pg=PA8 |isbn=0-387-95210-1 |year=2001 |publisher=Springer |author=Richard A. Mould |edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\tan(\phi) = \frac { h\sin(\theta)}{hv/c + h \cos (\theta)}=\frac { \sin(\theta)}{v/c +  \cos (\theta)} \ , &lt;/math&gt;

independent of the path length ''h'' traversed by the light.
It  may be more useful to express the correction (θ−φ) to the observed angle φ in terms of the observed angle itself:

:&lt;math&gt;\sin (\theta-\phi) = \frac{v}{c} \sin (\phi) \ , &lt;/math&gt;

which, because small ''v/c'' leads to small corrections, becomes:

:&lt;math&gt; \theta-\phi \approx \frac{v}{c} \sin (\phi) \ , &lt;/math&gt;

where use is made of the small-angle approximation to the sine function ''sin x ≈ x''.

As an example, if ''v'' is the component of the Earth's velocity along the direction of the light rays, this velocity changes month-to-month as the Earth traverses its orbit, making ''v'' a periodic function of the time of year, and consequently the aberration also varies periodically. This effect was used in 1727 by [[James Bradley|J Bradley]] to determine the speed of light as approximately 183,000 miles/s.&lt;ref name=J_Bradley&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Phil Trans Roy Soc |volume=35 |page=637 |year=1729 |author =James Bradley |title=An account of a new discovered motion of the fixed stars}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Britannica&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/76818/James-Bradley/76818rellinks/Related-Links Encyclopaedia Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt; A facsimile of his observations on the star γ-Draconis is shown in Figure 3.&lt;ref name=French&gt;A copy of the actual data is Figure 2-3 in {{cite book |title=Special Relativity |author=AP French |url=http://books.google.com/?id=udA0Gjq8vHIC&amp;pg=PA43 |page=43 |isbn=0-7487-6422-4 |year=1968 |publisher=CRC Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; More detail is provided [[#Bradley.27s_observations|below]].

As the Earth revolves around the Sun, it is moving at a velocity of approximately 30&amp;nbsp;km/s. The speed of light is approximately 300,000&amp;nbsp;km/s. In the special case where the Earth is moving perpendicularly to the direction of the star (that is, if angle ''θ'' in Figure 2 is 90 degrees), the angle of displacement, ''θ − φ'', would therefore be (in [[radian]]s) the ratio of the two velocities, or 1/10000, or about 20.5 [[arcsecond]]s.

This quantity is known as the ''constant of aberration'', and is conventionally represented by ''κ''. Its precise accepted value is 20&quot;.49552 (at [[J2000]]).

The plane of the Earth's orbit is known as the [[ecliptic]]. Annual aberration causes stars exactly on the ecliptic to appear to move back and forth along a straight line, varying by ''κ'' on either side of their true position. A star that is precisely at one of the ecliptic's poles will appear to move in a circle of radius ''κ'' about its true position, and stars at intermediate ecliptic latitudes will appear to move along a small [[ellipse]] (see Figure 4).

Aberration can be resolved into east-west and north-south components on the [[celestial sphere]], which therefore produce an apparent displacement of a star's [[right ascension]] and [[declination]], respectively. The former is larger (except at the ecliptic poles), but the latter was the first to be detected. This is because very accurate clocks are needed to measure such a small variation in right ascension, but a [[transit telescope]] calibrated with a [[plumb-bob|plumb line]] can detect very small changes in declination.

Figure 5 shows how aberration affects the apparent declination of a star at the north ecliptic pole, as seen by an imaginary observer who sees the star transit at the [[zenith]] (this observer would have to be positioned at [[latitude]] 66.6 degrees north &amp;ndash; i.e. on the [[arctic circle]]). At the time of the March [[equinox]], the Earth's orbital velocity is carrying the observer directly south as he or she observes the star at the zenith. The star's apparent declination is therefore displaced to the south by a value equal to ''κ''. Conversely, at the September equinox, the Earth's orbital velocity is carrying the observer northwards, and the star's position is displaced to the north by an equal and opposite amount. At the June and December [[solstice]]s, the displacement in declination is zero.  Likewise, the amount of displacement in [[right ascension]] is zero at either [[equinox]] and maximum at the [[solstice]]s.

Note that the effect of aberration is out of [[phase (waves)|phase]] with any displacement due to parallax. If the latter effect were present, the maximum displacement to the south would occur in December, and the maximum displacement to the north in June. It is this apparently anomalous motion that so mystified Bradley and his contemporaries.

====Solar annual aberration====
A special case of annual aberration is the nearly constant deflection of the Sun from its true position by ''κ'' towards the ''west'' (as viewed from Earth), opposite to the apparent motion of the Sun along the ecliptic (which is from west to east, as seen from Earth). The deflection thus makes the Sun appear to be behind (or retarded) from its actual position on the ecliptic by a position or angle ''κ.'' This constant deflection is often explained as due to the motion of the Earth during the 8.3 minutes that it takes light to travel from the Sun to Earth. This is a valid explanation ''provided'' it is given in the Earth's reference frame (where it becomes purely a [[light-time correction]] for the position of the eastward-moving Sun as seen from a stationary Earth), whereas in the ''Sun's reference frame'' the same phenomenon must be described as aberration of light when seen by the westward-moving Earth, which involves having Earth's telescopes pointed &quot;forward&quot; (westward, in a direction toward the Earth's motion relative to the Sun) by a slight amount. 

Since this is the same physical phenomenon, simply described from two different reference frames, it is not a coincidence that the angle of annual aberration of the Sun is equal to the path swept by the Sun along the ecliptic, in the time it takes for light to travel from it to the Earth (8.316746 minutes divided by one sidereal year (365.25636 days) is 20.49265&quot;, very nearly ''κ'').  Similarly, one could explain the Sun's apparent motion over the background of fixed stars as a (very large) parallax effect.

===Planetary aberration===
Planetary aberration is the combination of the aberration of light (due to Earth's velocity) and [[light-time correction]] (due to the object's motion and distance). Both are determined at the instant when the moving object's light reaches the moving observer on Earth. It is so called because it is usually applied to planets and other objects in the solar system whose motion and distance are accurately known.

===Diurnal aberration===
Diurnal aberration is caused by the velocity of the observer on the surface of the rotating Earth. It is therefore dependent not only on the time of the observation, but also the [[latitude]] and [[longitude]] of the observer. Its effect is much smaller than that of annual aberration, and is only 0&quot;.32 in the case of an observer at the equator, where the rotational velocity is greatest.

===Secular aberration===
The Sun and solar system are revolving around the center of the Galaxy, as are other nearby stars. Therefore the aberrational effect affects the apparent positions of other stars and on [[extragalactic astronomy|extragalactic]] objects: if a star is two thousand light years from Earth, we don't see it where it is now, but where it was two thousand years ago (in a reference frame moving with the solar system).

However, the change in the solar system's velocity relative to the center of the Galaxy varies over a very long timescale, and the consequent change in aberration would be extremely difficult to observe. Therefore, this so-called ''secular aberration'' is usually ignored when considering the positions of stars. In other words, star maps show the observed apparent positions of the stars, not their calculated true positions.

To estimate the true position of a star whose distance and proper motion are known, just multiply the proper motion (in arcseconds per year) by the distance (in light years). The apparent position lags behind the true position by that many arcseconds. Newcomb&lt;!--- (p. 170) ---&gt; gives the example of [[Groombridge 1830]], where he estimates that the true position is displaced by approximately 3 [[arcminutes]] from the direction in which we observe it. Modern figures give a proper motion of 7 arcseconds/year, distance 30 light years, so the displacement is 3 arcminutes and a half.  This calculation also includes an allowance for light-time correction, and is therefore analogous to the concept of planetary aberration.

==Historical background==
The discovery of the aberration of light in 1725 by [[James Bradley]] was one of the most important in astronomy. It was totally unexpected, and it was only by extraordinary perseverance and perspicuity that Bradley was able to explain it in 1727. Its origin is based on attempts made to discover whether the stars possessed appreciable [[parallax]]es. The [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernican]] theory of the [[solar system]] &amp;ndash; that the Earth revolved annually about the Sun &amp;ndash; had received confirmation by the observations of [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] and [[Tycho Brahe]] (who, however, never accepted [[heliocentrism]]), and the mathematical investigations of [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]] and [[Isaac Newton|Newton]].

===Search for stellar parallax===
As early as 1573, [[Thomas Digges]] had suggested that this theory should necessitate a parallactic shifting of the stars, and, consequently, if such stellar parallaxes existed, then the Copernican theory would receive additional confirmation. Many observers claimed to have determined such parallaxes, but Tycho Brahe and [[Giovanni Battista Riccioli]] concluded that they existed only in the minds of the observers, and were due to instrumental and personal errors. In 1680 [[Jean Picard]], in his ''Voyage d’[[Uraniborg|Uranibourg]],'' stated, as a result of ten [[year]]s' observations, that [[Polaris]], or the [[Pole Star]], exhibited variations in its position amounting to 40&quot; annually. Some astronomers endeavoured to explain this by parallax, but these attempts were futile, for the motion was at variance with that which parallax would produce.

[[John Flamsteed]], from measurements made in 1689 and succeeding years with his mural quadrant, similarly concluded that the declination of the Pole Star was 40&quot; less in July than in September. [[Robert Hooke]], in 1674, published his observations of γ [[Draco (constellation)|Draconis]], a star of [[apparent magnitude|magnitude]] 2&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt; which passes practically overhead at the latitude of [[London]], and whose observations are therefore free from the complex corrections due to astronomical [[refraction]], and concluded that this star was 23&quot; more northerly in July than in October.

===Bradley's observations===
When James Bradley and [[Samuel Molyneux]] entered this sphere of astronomical research in 1725, there consequently prevailed much uncertainty whether stellar parallaxes had been observed or not; and it was with the intention of definitely answering this question that these astronomers erected a large telescope at the house of the latter at [[Kew]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hirshfeld&quot;/&gt; They determined to reinvestigate the motion of γ Draconis; the telescope, constructed by [[George Graham (clockmaker)|George Graham]] (1675–1751), a celebrated instrument-maker, was affixed to a vertical chimney stack, in such manner as to permit a small oscillation of the eyepiece, the amount of which (i.e. the deviation from the vertical) was regulated and measured by the introduction of a screw and a plumb line.

The instrument was set up in November 1725, and observations on γ Draconis were made on the 3rd, 5th, 11th, and 12 December. There was apparently no shifting of the star, which was therefore thought to be at its most southerly point. On December 17, however, Bradley observed that the star was moving southwards, a motion further shown by observations on the 20th. These results were unexpected and inexplicable by existing theories. However, an examination of the telescope showed that the observed anomalies were not due to instrumental errors.

The observations were continued, and the star was seen to continue its southerly course until March, when it took up a position some 20&quot; more southerly than its December position. After March it began to pass northwards, a motion quite apparent by the middle of April; in June it passed at the same distance from the [[zenith]] as it did in December; and in September it passed through its most northerly position, the extreme range from north to south, i.e. the angle between the March and September positions, being 40&quot;.

===Aberration vs nutation===
This motion was evidently not due to parallax, for the reasons given in the discussion of Figure 2, and neither was it due to observational errors. Bradley and Molyneux discussed several hypotheses in the hope of finding the solution. The idea that immediately suggested itself was that the star's declination varied because of short-term changes in the orientation of the Earth's axis relative to the celestial sphere &amp;ndash; a phenomenon known as [[nutation]]. Because this is a change to the observer's frame of reference (i.e. the Earth itself), it would therefore affect all stars equally. For instance, a change in the declination of γ Draconis would be mirrored by an equal and opposite change to the declination of a star 180 degrees opposite in right ascension.

Observations of such a star were made difficult by the limited field of view of Bradley and Molyneux's telescope, and the lack of suitable stars of sufficient brightness. One such star, however, with a right ascension nearly equal to that of γ Draconis, but in the opposite sense, was selected and kept under observation. This star was seen to possess an apparent motion similar to that which would be a consequence of the nutation of the Earth's axis; but since its declination varied only one half as much as in the case of γ Draconis, it was obvious that nutation did not supply the requisite solution. Whether the motion was due to an irregular distribution of the [[Earth's atmosphere]], thus involving abnormal variations in the refractive index, was also investigated; here, again, negative results were obtained.

On August 19, 1727, Bradley then embarked upon a further series of observations using a telescope of his own erected at the Rectory, [[Wanstead]]. This instrument had the advantage of a larger field of view and he was able to obtain precise positions of a large number of stars that transited close to the zenith over the course of about two years. This established the existence of the phenomenon of aberration beyond all doubt, and also allowed Bradley to formulate a set of rules that would allow the calculation of the effect on any given star at a specified date. However, he was no closer to finding an explanation of why aberration occurred.

===Development of the theory of aberration===
Bradley eventually developed the explanation of aberration in about September 1728 and his theory was presented to the [[Royal Society]] in mid January the next year. One well-known story (quoted in ''Berry'', page 261) was that he saw the change of direction of a wind vane on a boat on the [[Thames]], caused not by an alteration of the wind itself, but by a change of course of the boat relative to the wind direction. However, there is no record of this incident in Bradley's own account of the discovery, and it may therefore be [[apocrypha]]l.

The discovery and elucidation of aberration is now regarded as a classic case of the application of [[scientific method]], in which observations are made to test a theory, but unexpected results are sometimes obtained that in turn lead to new discoveries. It is also worth noting that part of the original motivation of the search for stellar parallax was to test the Copernican theory that the Earth revolves around the Sun, but of course the existence of aberration also establishes the truth of that theory.

In a final twist, Bradley later went on to discover the existence of the nutation of the Earth's axis &amp;ndash; the effect that he had originally considered to be the cause of aberration.

{{Optical aberration}}
'''Aberrations''' are departures of the performance of an optical system from the predictions of [[paraxial optics]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ref1&quot;&gt;{{cite book

It occurs when light from one point of an object after transmission through the system does not converge into (or does not diverge from) a single point. Instrument-makers need to correct optical systems to compensate for aberration. The articles on [[Reflection (physics)|reflection]], [[refraction]] and [[caustic (optics)|caustics]] discuss the general features of reflected and refracted [[ray (optics)|rays]].

==Overview==
Aberrations fall into two classes: ''monochromatic'' and ''chromatic''. Monochromatic aberrations are caused by the geometry of the lens and occur both when light is reflected and when it is refracted. They appear even when using [[monochromatic light]], hence the name.

[[Chromatic aberration]]s are caused by [[dispersion (optics)|dispersion]], the variation of a [[lens (optics)|lens's]] [[refractive index]] with [[wavelength]]. They do not appear when monochromatic light is used.

===Monochromatic aberrations===
*[[Piston (optics)|Piston]]
*[[Tilt (optics)|Tilt]]
*[[Defocus aberration|Defocus]]
*[[Spherical aberration]]
*[[Coma (optics)|Coma]]
*[[Astigmatism]]
*Field curvature
*[[Image distortion]]

Piston and tilt are not actually true optical aberrations, as they do not represent or model [[curvature]] in the wavefront. If an otherwise perfect wavefront is &quot;aberrated&quot; by piston and tilt, it will still form a perfect, aberration-free image, only shifted to a different position. Defocus is the lowest-order true optical aberration.

===Chromatic aberrations===
{{main|Chromatic aberration}}
*Axial, or longitudinal, chromatic aberration
*Lateral, or transverse, chromatic aberration

==Monochromatic aberration==
The elementary theory of optical systems leads to the theorem: Rays of light proceeding from any ''object point'' unite in an ''image point''; and therefore an ''object space'' is reproduced in an ''image space.'' The introduction of simple auxiliary terms, due to [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|C. F. Gauss]] (''Dioptrische Untersuchungen'', Göttingen, 1841), named the [[focal length]]s and [[focal plane]]s, permits the determination of the image of any object for any system (see [[Lens (optics)|lens]]). The Gaussian theory, however, is only true so long as the angles made by all rays with the optical axis (the symmetrical axis of the system) are infinitely small, i.e. with infinitesimal objects, images and lenses; in practice these conditions are not realized, and the images projected by uncorrected systems are, in general, ill defined and often completely blurred, if the aperture or field of view exceeds certain limits.

The investigations of [[James Clerk Maxwell]] (''Phil.Mag.,'' 1856; ''Quart. Journ. Math.,'' 1858) and [[Ernst Abbe]]&lt;ref&gt;The investigations of Ernst Abbe on geometrical optics, originally published only in his university lectures, were first compiled by S. Czapski in 1893. See full reference below.&lt;/ref&gt; showed that the properties of these reproductions, i.e. the relative position and magnitude of the images, are not special properties of optical systems, but necessary consequences of the supposition (in Abbe) of the reproduction of all points of a space in image points (Maxwell assumes a less general hypothesis), and are independent of the manner in which the reproduction is effected.  These authors proved, however, that no optical system can justify these suppositions, since they are contradictory to the fundamental laws of reflexion and refraction.  Consequently the Gaussian theory only supplies a convenient method of approximating to reality; and no constructor would attempt to realize this unattainable ideal.  All that at present can be attempted is, to reproduce a single plane in another plane; but even this has not been altogether satisfactorily accomplished, aberrations always occur, and it is improbable that these will ever be entirely corrected.

This, and related general questions, have been treated — besides the above-mentioned authors — by M. Thiesen (''Berlin. Akad. Sitzber.,'' 1890, xxxv. 799; ''Berlin. Phys. Ges. Verh.,'' 1892) and H. Bruns (''Leipzig. Math.  Phys. Ber.,'' 1895, xxi. 325) by means of Sir W. R. Hamilton's ''characteristic function'' (Irish Acad. Trans., ''Theory of Systems of Rays'', 1828, et seq.).  Reference may also be made to the treatise of Czapski-Eppenstein, pp.&amp;nbsp;155–161.

A review of the simplest cases of aberration will now be given.

===Aberration of axial points (spherical aberration in the restricted sense)===
[[Image:ABERR1.svg|right|frame|Figure 5]]

Let S (fig.5) be any optical system, rays proceeding from an axis point O under an angle u1 will unite in the axis point O'1; and those under an angle u2 in the axis point O'2.  If there is refraction at a collective spherical surface, or through a thin positive lens, O'2 will lie in front of O'1 so long as the angle u2 is greater than u1 (''under correction''); and conversely with a dispersive surface or lenses (''over correction'').  The caustic, in the first case, resembles the sign &gt; (greater than); in the second &lt; (less than).  If the angle u1 is very small, O'1 is the Gaussian image; and O'1 O'2 is termed the ''longitudinal aberration,'' and O'1R the ''lateral aberration'' of the [[Pencil (physics)|pencils]] with aperture u2. If the pencil with the angle u2 is that of the maximum aberration of all the pencils transmitted, then in a plane perpendicular to the axis at O'1 there is a circular ''disk of confusion'' of radius O'1R, and in a parallel plane at O'2 another one of radius O'2R2; between these two is situated the ''disk of least confusion.''

The largest opening of the pencils, which take part in the reproduction of O, i.e. the angle u, is generally determined by the margin of one of the lenses or by a hole in a thin plate placed between, before, or behind the lenses of the system.  This hole is termed the ''stop'' or ''diaphragm''; Abbe used the term ''[[aperture]] stop'' for both the hole and the limiting margin of the lens.  The component S1 of the system, situated between the aperture stop and the object O, projects an image of the diaphragm, termed by Abbe the ''entrance pupil''; the ''exit pupil'' is the image formed by the component S2, which is placed behind the aperture stop.  All rays which issue from O and pass through the aperture stop also pass through the entrance and exit pupils, since these are images of the aperture stop.  Since the maximum aperture of the pencils issuing from O is the angle u subtended by the entrance pupil at this point, the magnitude of the aberration will be determined by the position and diameter of the entrance pupil.  If the system be entirely behind the aperture stop, then this is itself the entrance pupil (''front stop''); if entirely in front, it is the exit pupil (''back stop'').

If the object point be infinitely distant, all rays received by the first member of the system are parallel, and their intersections, after traversing the system, vary according to their ''perpendicular height of incidence,'' i.e. their distance from the axis.  This distance replaces the angle u in the preceding considerations; and the aperture, i.e. the radius of the entrance pupil, is its maximum value.

===Aberration of elements, i.e. smallest objects at right angles to the axis===
If rays issuing from O (fig. 5) be concurrent, it does not follow that points in a portion of a plane perpendicular at O to the axis will be also concurrent, even if the part of the plane be very small.  With a considerable aperture, the neighboring point N will be reproduced, but attended by aberrations comparable in magnitude to ON. These aberrations are avoided if, according to Abbe, the ''sine condition,'' sin u'1/sin u1=sin u'2/sin u2, holds for all rays reproducing the point O. If the object point O is infinitely distant, u1 and u2 are to be replaced by h1 and h2, the perpendicular heights of incidence; the ''sine condition'' then becomes sin u'1/h1 sin u'2/h2. A system fulfilling this condition and free from spherical aberration is called ''aplanatic'' (Greek a-, privative, plann, a wandering).  This word was first used by [[Robert Blair (astronomer)|Robert Blair]] (d. 1828), professor of practical astronomy at Edinburgh University, to characterize a superior achromatism, and, subsequently, by many writers to denote freedom from spherical aberration.  Both the aberration of axis points, and the deviation from the sine condition, rapidly increase in most (uncorrected) systems with the aperture.

===Aberration of lateral object points (points beyond the axis) with narrow pencils. Astigmatism.===
[[Image:ABERR2.svg|right|frame|Figure 6]]

A point O (fig. 6) at a finite distance from the axis (or with an infinitely distant object, a point which subtends a finite angle at the system) is, in general, even then not sharply reproduced, if the pencil of rays issuing from it and traversing the system is made infinitely narrow by reducing the aperture stop; such a pencil consists of the rays which can pass from the object point through the now infinitely small entrance pupil.  It is seen (ignoring exceptional cases) that the pencil does not meet the refracting or reflecting surface at right angles; therefore it is astigmatic (Gr. a-, privative, stigmia, a point).  Naming the central ray passing through the entrance pupil the ''axis of the pencil'' or ''principal ray,'' it can be said: the rays of the pencil intersect, not in one point, but in two focal lines, which can be assumed to be at right angles to the principal ray; of these, one lies in the plane containing the principal ray and the axis of the system, i.e. in the ''first principal section'' or ''meridional section'', and the other at right angles to it, i.e. in the second principal section or sagittal section.  We receive, therefore, in no single intercepting plane behind the system, as, for example, a focusing screen, an image of the object point; on the other hand, in each of two planes lines O' and O&quot; are separately formed (in neighboring planes ellipses are formed), and in a plane between O' and O&quot; a circle of least confusion.  The interval O'O&quot;, termed the astigmatic difference, increases, in general, with the angle W made by the principal ray OP with the axis of the system, i.e. with the field of view.  Two ''astigmatic image surfaces'' correspond to one object plane; and these are in contact at the axis point; on the one lie the focal lines of the first kind, on the other those of the second.  Systems in which the two astigmatic surfaces coincide are termed anastigmatic or stigmatic.

[[Isaac Newton|Sir Isaac Newton]] was probably the discoverer of astigmation; the position of the astigmatic image lines was determined by Thomas Young (''A Course of Lectures on Natural Philosophy,'' 1807); and the theory was developed by [[Allvar Gullstrand]].&lt;ref&gt;Gullstrand, ''Skand. Arch. f. Physiol.,'' 1890, 2, p. 269; ''Allgemeine Theorie der monochromat. Aberrationen,'' etc., Upsala, 1900; ''Arch. f.  Ophth.,'' 1901, 53, pp. 2, 185)&lt;/ref&gt;  A bibliography by P. Culmann is given in Moritz von Rohr's ''Die Bilderzeugung in optischen Instrumenten''.&lt;ref name=vonRohr&gt;[[Moritz von Rohr]], ''Die bilderzeugung in optischen Instrumenten vom Standpunkte der geometrischen Optik'' (Berlin, 1904)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aberration of lateral object points with broad pencils.  Coma.===
By opening the stop wider, similar deviations arise for lateral points as have been already discussed for axial points; but in this case they are much more complicated.  The course of the rays in the meridional section is no longer symmetrical to the principal ray of the pencil; and on an intercepting plane there appears, instead of a luminous point, a patch of light, not symmetrical about a point, and often exhibiting a resemblance to a comet having its tail directed towards or away from the axis.  From this appearance it takes its name.  The unsymmetrical form of the meridional pencil—formerly the only one considered—is [[coma (optics)|coma]] in the narrower sense only; other errors of coma have been treated by [[Arthur König]] and Moritz von Rohr,&lt;ref name=vonRohr/&gt; and later by Allvar Gullstrand.&lt;ref&gt;[[Allvar Gullstrand]], ''Allgemeine Theorie der monochromat. Aberrationen,'' etc., Upsala, 1900; ''Ann. d.  Phys.,'' 1905, 18, p. 941)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Curvature of the field of the image===
{{main|Petzval field curvature}}
If the above errors be eliminated, the two astigmatic surfaces united, and a sharp image obtained with a wide aperture—there remains the necessity to correct the curvature of the image surface, especially when the image is to be received upon a plane surface, e.g. in photography.  In most cases the surface is concave towards the system.

===Distortion of the image===
[[Image:Barrel distortion.svg|thumb|right|Fig. 7a: Barrel distortion]]
[[Image:Pincushion distortion.svg|thumb|right|Fig. 7b: Pincushion distortion]]

Even if the image is sharp, it may be distorted compared to ideal [[pinhole projection]].  In pinhole projection, the magnification of an object is inversely proportional to its distance to the camera along the optical axis so that a camera pointing directly at a flat surface reproduces that flat surface. Distortion can be thought of as stretching the image non-uniformly, or, equivalently, as a variation in magnification across the field. While &quot;distortion&quot; can include arbitrary deformation of an image, the most pronounced modes of distortion produced by conventional imaging optics is &quot;barrel distortion&quot;, in which the center of the image is magnified more than the perimeter (figure 7a). The reverse, in which the perimeter is magnified more than the center, is known as &quot;pincushion distortion&quot; (figure 7b). This effect is called lens distortion or [[image distortion]], and there are [http://www.vassg.hu/pdf/vass_gg_2003_lo.pdf algorithms] to correct it.

Systems free of distortion are called ''orthoscopic'' (orthos, right, skopein to look) or ''rectilinear'' (straight lines).

[[Image:ABERR3rev.svg|left|frame|Figure 8]]
This aberration is quite distinct from that of the sharpness of reproduction; in unsharp, reproduction, the question of distortion arises if only parts of the object can be recognized in the figure.  If, in an unsharp image, a patch of light corresponds to an object point, the ''center of gravity'' of the patch may be regarded as the image point, this being the point where the plane receiving the image, e.g., a focusing screen, intersects the ray passing through the middle of the stop.  This assumption is justified if a poor image on the focusing screen remains stationary when the aperture is diminished; in practice, this generally occurs.  This ray, named by Abbe a ''principal ray'' (not to be confused with the ''principal rays'' of the Gaussian theory), passes through the center of the entrance pupil before the first refraction, and the center of the exit pupil after the last refraction.  From this it follows that correctness of drawing depends solely upon the principal rays; and is independent of the sharpness or curvature of the image field.  Referring to fig. 8, we have O'Q'/OQ = a' tan w'/a tan w = 1/N, where N is the ''scale'' or magnification of the image.  For N to be constant for all values of w, a' tan w'/a tan w must also be constant.  If the ratio a'/a be sufficiently constant, as is often the case, the above relation reduces to the ''condition of [[George Biddell Airy|Airy]],'' i.e. tan w'/ tan w= a constant.  This simple relation (see Camb.  Phil.  Trans., 1830, 3, p.&amp;nbsp;1) is fulfilled in all systems which are symmetrical with respect to their diaphragm (briefly named ''symmetrical or holosymmetrical objectives''), or which consist of two like, but different-sized, components, placed from the diaphragm in the ratio of their size, and presenting the same curvature to it (hemisymmetrical objectives); in these systems tan w' / tan w = 1.

The constancy of a'/a necessary for this relation to hold was pointed out by R. H. Bow (Brit.  Journ.  Photog., 1861), and Thomas Sutton (Photographic Notes, 1862); it has been treated by O. Lummer and by M. von Rohr (Zeit. f.  Instrumentenk., 1897, 17, and 1898, 18, p.&amp;nbsp;4). It requires the middle of the aperture stop to be reproduced in the centers of the entrance and exit pupils without spherical aberration.  M. von Rohr showed that for systems fulfilling neither the Airy nor the Bow-Sutton condition, the ratio a' cos w'/a tan w will be constant for one distance of the object.  This combined condition is exactly fulfilled by holosymmetrical objectives reproducing with the scale 1, and by hemisymmetrical, if the scale of reproduction be equal to the ratio of the sizes of the two components.

===Zernike model of aberrations===
Circular wavefront profiles associated with aberrations may be mathematically modeled using [[Zernike polynomial]]s.  Developed by [[Frits Zernike]] in the 1930s, Zernike's polynomials are [[orthogonal]] over a circle of unit radius. A complex, aberrated wavefront profile may be [[curve-fitted]] with Zernike polynomials to yield a set of fitting [[coefficients]] that individually represent different types of aberrations.  These Zernike coefficients are [[linearly independent]], thus individual aberration contributions to an overall wavefront may be isolated and quantified separately.

There are [[even and odd functions|even and odd]] Zernike polynomials. The even Zernike polynomials are defined as

:&lt;math&gt;Z^{m}_n(\rho,\phi) = R^m_n(\rho)\,\cos(m\,\phi) \!&lt;/math&gt;

and the odd Zernike polynomials as

:&lt;math&gt;Z^{-m}_n(\rho,\phi) = R^m_n(\rho)\,\sin(m\,\phi), \!&lt;/math&gt;

where ''m'' and ''n'' are nonnegative [[integer]]s with &lt;math&gt;n\geq m&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is the [[azimuth]]al [[angle]] in [[radian]]s, and &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the normalized radial distance.  The radial polynomials &lt;math&gt;R^m_n&lt;/math&gt; have no azimuthal dependence, and are defined as

:&lt;math&gt;R^m_n(\rho) = \! \sum_{k=0}^{(n-m)/2} \!\!\! \frac{(-1)^k\,(n-k)!}{k!\,((n+m)/2-k)!\,((n-m)/2-k)!} \;\rho^{n-2\,k} \quad\mbox{if } n-m \mbox{ is even}&lt;/math&gt;

and &lt;math&gt;R^m_n(\rho)=0&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;n-m&lt;/math&gt; is odd.

The first few Zernike polynomials are:
{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;a_0\ &lt;/math&gt; || &quot;Piston&quot;, equal to the [[mean value]] of the wavefront
|-
|&lt;math&gt;a_1\times \rho \cos(\theta)&lt;/math&gt; || &quot;X-Tilt&quot;, the deviation of the overall beam in the [[Sagittal ray#Optical systems|sagittal]] direction
|-
|&lt;math&gt;a_2\times \rho \sin(\theta)&lt;/math&gt; || &quot;Y-Tilt&quot;, the deviation of the overall beam in the [[Tangential ray#Optical systems|tangential]] direction
|-
|&lt;math&gt;a_3\times (2\rho^2-1)&lt;/math&gt; || &quot;Defocus&quot;, a [[Parabola|parabolic]] wavefront resulting from being out of focus
|-
|&lt;math&gt;a_4\times \rho^2 \cos(2\theta)&lt;/math&gt; || &quot;0° Astigmatism&quot;, a [[cylindrical]] shape along the X or Y axis
|-
|&lt;math&gt;a_5\times \rho^2 \sin(2\theta)&lt;/math&gt; || &quot;45° Astigmatism&quot;, a cylindrical shape oriented at ±45° from the X axis
|-
|&lt;math&gt;a_6\times (3\rho^2-2)\rho \cos(\theta)&lt;/math&gt; || &quot;X-Coma&quot;, comatic image flaring in the horizontal direction
|-
|&lt;math&gt;a_7\times (3\rho^2-2)\rho \sin(\theta)&lt;/math&gt; || &quot;Y-Coma&quot;, comatic image flaring in the vertical direction
|-
|&lt;math&gt;a_8\times (6\rho^4-6\rho^2+1)&lt;/math&gt; || &quot;Third order spherical aberration&quot;
|}

where &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the normalized pupil radius with &lt;math&gt;0 \le \rho \le 1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is the azimuthal angle around the pupil with &lt;math&gt;0 \le \theta \le 2\pi&lt;/math&gt;, and the fitting coefficients &lt;math&gt;a_0,\ldots,a_8&lt;/math&gt; are the wavefront errors in wavelengths.

As in [[Fourier analysis|Fourier]] synthesis using [[sine]]s and [[cosine]]s, a wavefront may be perfectly represented by a sufficiently large number of higher-order Zernike polynomials.  However, wavefronts with very steep [[gradients]] or very high [[spatial frequency]] structure, such as produced by [[Wave propagation|propagation]] through [[atmospheric turbulence]] or [[turbulence|aerodynamic flowfields]], are not well modeled by Zernike polynomials, which tend to [[low-pass filter]] fine [[spatial]] definition in the wavefront. In this case, other fitting methods such as [[fractals]] or [[singular value decomposition]] may yield improved fitting results.

The [[Zernike polynomials|circle polynomials]] were introduced by [[Fritz Zernike]] to evaluate the point image of an aberrated optical system taking into account the effects of [[diffraction]]. The perfect point image in the presence of diffraction had already been described by [[George Biddell Airy|Airy]], as early as 1835. It took almost hundred years to arrive at a comprehensive theory and modeling of the point image of aberrated systems (Zernike and Nijboer). The  analysis by Nijboer and Zernike describes the intensity distribution close to the optimum focal plane. An extended theory that allows the calculation of the point image amplitude and  intensity over a much larger volume in the focal region was recently developed ([http://www.nijboerzernike.nl Extended Nijboer-Zernike theory]). This Extended Nijboer-Zernike theory of point image or ‘point-spread function’ formation has found applications in general research on image formation, especially for systems with a high [[numerical aperture]], and in characterizing optical systems with respect to their aberrations.

==Analytic treatment of aberrations==
The preceding review of the several errors of reproduction belongs to the ''Abbe theory of aberrations,'' in which definite aberrations are discussed separately; it is well suited to practical needs, for in the construction of an optical instrument certain errors are sought to be eliminated, the selection of which is justified by experience.  In the mathematical sense, however, this selection is arbitrary; the reproduction of a finite object with a finite aperture entails, in all probability, an infinite number of aberrations.  This number is only finite if the object and aperture are assumed to be ''infinitely small of a certain order''; and with each order of infinite smallness, i.e. with each degree of approximation to reality (to finite objects and apertures), a certain number of aberrations is associated.  This connection is only supplied by theories which treat aberrations generally and analytically by means of indefinite series.

A ray proceeding from an object point O (fig. 9) can be defined by the coordinates (ξ, η).  Of this point O in an object plane I, at right angles to the axis, and two other coordinates (x, y), the point in which the ray intersects the entrance pupil, i.e. the plane II. Similarly the corresponding image ray may be defined by the points (ξ', η'), and (x', y'), in the planes I' and II'. The origins of these four plane coordinate systems may be collinear with the axis of the optical system; and the corresponding axes may be parallel.  Each of the four coordinates ξ', η', x', y' are functions of ξ, η, x, y; and if it be assumed that the field of view and the aperture be infinitely small, then ξ, η, x, y are of the same order of infinitesimals; consequently by expanding ξ', η', x', y' in ascending powers of ξ, η, x, y, series are obtained in which it is only necessary to consider the lowest powers.  It is readily seen that if the optical system be symmetrical, the origins of the coordinate systems collinear with the optical axis and the corresponding axes parallel, then by changing the signs of ξ, η, x, y, the values ξ', η', x', y' must likewise change their sign, but retain their arithmetical values; this means that the series are restricted to odd powers of the unmarked variables.

The nature of the reproduction consists in the rays proceeding from a point O being united in another point O'; in general, this will not be the case, for ξ', η' vary if ξ, η be constant, but x, y variable.  It may be assumed that the planes I' and II' are drawn where the images of the planes I and II are formed by rays near the axis by the ordinary Gaussian rules; and by an extension of these rules, not, however, corresponding to reality, the Gauss image point O'&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, with coordinates ξ'&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, η'&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, of the point O at some distance from the axis could be constructed.  Writing Dξ'=ξ'-ξ'&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and Dη'=η'-η'&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, then Dξ' and Dη' are the aberrations belonging to ξ, η and x, y, and are functions of these magnitudes which, when expanded in series, contain only odd powers, for the same reasons as given above.  On account of the aberrations of all rays which pass through O, a patch of light, depending in size on the lowest powers of ξ, η, x, y which the aberrations contain, will be formed in the plane I'. These degrees, named by ([[Jozef Maximilián Petzval|J. Petzval]] (''Bericht uber die Ergebnisse einiger dioptrischer Untersuchungen'', Buda Pesth, 1843; ''Akad. Sitzber., Wien,'' 1857, vols. xxiv. xxvi.) ''the numerical orders of the image,'' are consequently only odd powers; the condition for the formation of an image of the mth order is that in the series for Dξ' and Dη' the coefficients of the powers of the 3rd, 5th…(m-2)th degrees must vanish.  The images of the Gauss theory being of the third order, the next problem is to obtain an image of 5th order, or to make the coefficients of the powers of 3rd degree zero.  This necessitates the satisfying of five equations; in other words, there are five alterations of the 3rd order, the vanishing of which produces an image of the 5th order.

The expression for these coefficients in terms of the constants of the optical system, i.e. the radii, thicknesses, refractive indices and distances between the lenses, was solved by [[Philipp Ludwig von Seidel|L. Seidel]] (Astr. Nach., 1856, p.&amp;nbsp;289); in 1840, J. Petzval constructed his portrait objective, from similar calculations which have never been published (see M. von Rohr, ''Theorie und Geschichte des photographischen Objectivs'', Berlin, 1899, p.&amp;nbsp;248).  The theory was elaborated by S. Finterswalder (Munchen. Acad.  Abhandl., 1891, 17, p.&amp;nbsp;519), who also published a posthumous paper of Seidel containing a short view of his work (''München. Akad. Sitzber.,'' 1898, 28, p.&amp;nbsp;395); a simpler form was given by A. Kerber (''Beiträge zur Dioptrik'', Leipzig, 1895-6-7-8-9).  A. Konig and M. von Rohr (see M. von Rohr, ''Die Bilderzeugung in optischen Instrumenten'', pp.&amp;nbsp;317–323) have represented Kerber's method, and have deduced the Seidel formulae from geometrical considerations based on the Abbe method, and have interpreted the analytical results geometrically (pp.&amp;nbsp;212–316).

The aberrations can also be expressed by means of the ''characteristic function'' of the system and its differential coefficients, instead of by the radii, &amp;c., of the lenses; these formulae are not immediately applicable, but give, however, the relation between the number of aberrations and the order.  Sir William Rowan Hamilton (British Assoc.  Report, 1833, p.&amp;nbsp;360) thus derived the aberrations of the third order; and in later times the method was pursued by Clerk Maxwell (''Proc. London Math. Soc.,'' 1874–1875; (see also the treatises of R. S. Heath and L. A. Herman), M. Thiesen (''Berlin. Akad.  Sitzber.,'' 1890, 35, p.&amp;nbsp;804), H. Bruns (''Leipzig. Math. Phys. Ber.,'' 1895, 21, p.&amp;nbsp;410), and particularly successfully by K. Schwarzschild (''Göttingen.  Akad.  Abhandl.,'' 1905, 4, No. 1), who thus discovered the aberrations of the 5th order (of which there are nine), and possibly the shortest proof of the practical (Seidel) formulae.  A. Gullstrand (vide supra, and ''Ann. d.  Phys.,'' 1905, 18, p.&amp;nbsp;941) founded his theory of aberrations on the differential geometry of surfaces.

The aberrations of the third order are: (1) aberration of the axis point; (2) aberration of points whose distance from the axis is very small, less than of the third order — the deviation from the sine condition and coma here fall together in one class; (3) astigmatism; (4) curvature of the field; (5) distortion.

:'''(1)''' Aberration of the third order of axis points is dealt with in all text-books on optics.  It is very important in telescope design. In telescopes aperture is usually taken as the linear diameter of the objective. It is not the same as microscope aperture which is based on the entrance pupil or field of view as seen from the object and is expressed as an angular measurement. Higher order aberrations in telescope design can be mostly neglected. For microscopes it cannot be neglected. For a single lens of very small thickness and given power, the aberration depends upon the ratio of the radii r:r', and is a minimum (but never zero) for a certain value of this ratio; it varies inversely with the refractive index (the power of the lens remaining constant).  The total aberration of two or more very thin lenses in contact, being the sum of the individual aberrations, can be zero.  This is also possible if the lenses have the same algebraic sign.  Of thin positive lenses with n=1.5, four are necessary to correct spherical aberration of the third order.  These systems, however, are not of great practical importance.  In most cases, two thin lenses are combined, one of which has just so strong a positive aberration (''under-correction,'' vide supra) as the other a negative; the first must be a positive lens and the second a negative lens; the powers, however: may differ, so that the desired effect of the lens is maintained.  It is generally an advantage to secure a great refractive effect by several weaker than by one high-power lens.  By one, and likewise by several, and even by an infinite number of thin lenses in contact, no more than two axis points can be reproduced without aberration of the third order.  Freedom from aberration for two axis points, one of which is infinitely distant, is known as ''Herschel's condition.'' All these rules are valid, inasmuch as the thicknesses and distances of the lenses are not to be taken into account.

:'''(2)''' The condition for freedom from coma in the third order is also of importance for telescope objectives; it is known as ''[[Joseph von Fraunhofer|Fraunhofer's]] condition.'' (4) After eliminating the aberration On the axis, coma and astigmatism, the relation for the flatness of the field in the third order is expressed by the ''Petzval equation,'' S1/r(n'-n) = 0, where r is the radius of a refracting surface, n and n' the refractive indices of the neighboring media, and S the sign of summation for all refracting surfaces.

==Practical elimination of aberrations==
The classical imaging problem is to reproduce perfectly a finite plane (the object) onto another plane (the image) through a finite aperture. It is impossible to do so perfectly for ''more than one'' such pairs of planes (this was proven with increasing generality by [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]] in 1858, by Bruns in 1895, and by [[Constantin Carathéodory|Carathéodory]] in 1926, see summary in Walther, A., J. Opt. Soc. Am. A '''6''', 415–422 (1989)). For a single pair of planes (e.g. for a single focus setting of an objective), however, the problem can in principle be solved perfectly. Examples of such a theoretically perfect system include the [[Luneburg lens]] and the [[Maxwell fish-eye]].

Practical methods solve this problem with an accuracy which mostly suffices for the special purpose of each species of instrument.  The problem of finding a system which reproduces a given object upon a given plane with given magnification (insofar as aberrations must be taken into account) could be dealt with by means of the approximation theory; in most cases, however, the analytical difficulties were too great for older calculation methods but may be ameliorated by application of modern computer systems.  Solutions, however, have been obtained in special cases (see A. Konig in M. von Rohr's ''Die Bilderzeugung'', p.&amp;nbsp;373; K. Schwarzschild, Gottingen.  Akad. Abhandl., 1905, 4, Nos. 2 and 3). At the present time constructors almost always employ the inverse method: they compose a system from certain, often quite personal experiences, and test, by the trigonometrical calculation of the paths of several rays, whether the system gives the desired reproduction (examples are given in A. Gleichen, ''Lehrbuch der geometrischen Optik'', Leipzig and Berlin, 1902).  The radii, thicknesses and distances are continually altered until the errors of the image become sufficiently small.  By this method only certain errors of reproduction are investigated, especially individual members, or all, of those named above.  The analytical approximation theory is often employed provisionally, since its accuracy does not generally suffice.

In order to render spherical aberration and the deviation from the sine condition small throughout the whole aperture, there is given to a ray with a finite angle of aperture u* (width infinitely distant objects: with a finite height of incidence h*) the same distance of intersection, and the same sine ratio as to one neighboring the axis (u* or h* may not be much smaller than the largest aperture U or H to be used in the system).  The rays with an angle of aperture smaller than u* would not have the same distance of intersection and the same sine ratio; these deviations are called ''zones,'' and the constructor endeavors to reduce these to a minimum.  The same holds for the errors depending upon the angle of the field of view, w: astigmatism, curvature of field and distortion are eliminated for a definite value, w*, ''zones of astigmatism, curvature of field and distortion,'' attend smaller values of w.  The practical optician names such systems: ''corrected for the angle of aperture u* (the height of incidence h*) or the angle of field of view w*.'' Spherical aberration and changes of the sine ratios are often represented graphically as functions of the aperture, in the same way as the deviations of two astigmatic image surfaces of the image plane of the axis point are represented as functions of the angles of the field of view.

The final form of a practical system consequently rests on compromise; enlargement of the aperture results in a diminution of the available field of view, and vice versa. But the larger aperture will give the larger resolution. The following may be regarded as typical:

:(1) Largest aperture; necessary corrections are — for the axis point, and sine condition; errors of the field of view are almost disregarded; example — high-power microscope objectives.

:(2) [[Wide angle lens]]; necessary corrections are — for astigmatism, curvature of field and distortion; errors of the aperture only slightly regarded; examples — photographic widest angle objectives and oculars.

:Between these extreme examples stands the [[normal lens]]: this is corrected more with regard to aperture; objectives for groups more with regard to the field of view.

:(3) [[Long focus lens]]es have small fields of view and aberrations on axis are very important. Therefore zones will be kept as small as possible and design should emphasize simplicity. Because of this these lenses are the best for analytical computation.

==Chromatic or color aberration==
In optical systems composed of lenses, the position, magnitude and errors of the image depend upon the refractive indices of the glass employed (see [[Lens (optics)]] and [[#Monochromatic aberration|Monochromatic aberration]], above).  Since the index of refraction varies with the color or wavelength of the light (see [[dispersion (optics)|dispersion]]), it follows that a system of lenses (uncorrected) projects images of different colors in somewhat different places and sizes and with different aberrations; i.e. there are ''chromatic differences'' of the distances of intersection, of magnifications, and of monochromatic aberrations.  If mixed light be employed (e.g. white light) all these images are formed; and since they are all ultimately intercepted by a plane (the retina of the eye, a focusing screen of a camera, etc.), they cause a confusion, named chromatic aberration; for instance, instead of a white margin on a dark background, there is perceived a colored margin, or narrow spectrum.  The absence of this error is termed achromatism, and an optical system so corrected is termed achromatic.  A system is said to be ''chromatically under-corrected'' when it shows the same kind of chromatic error as a thin positive lens, otherwise it is said to be ''over-corrected.''

If, in the first place, monochromatic aberrations be neglected — in other words, the Gaussian theory be accepted — then every reproduction is determined by the positions of the focal planes, and the magnitude of the focal lengths, or if the focal lengths, as ordinarily happens, be equal, by three constants of reproduction.  These constants are determined by the data of the system (radii, thicknesses, distances, indices, etc., of the lenses); therefore their dependence on the refractive index, and consequently on the color, are calculable.&lt;ref&gt;formulae are given in Czapski-Eppenstein, ''Grundzuge der Theorie der optischen Instrumente'' (1903, p. 166)&lt;/ref&gt;  The refractive indices for different wavelengths must be known for each kind of glass made use of.  In this manner the conditions are maintained that any one constant of reproduction is equal for two different colors, i.e. this constant is achromatized.  For example, it is possible, with one thick lens in air, to achromatize the position of a focal plane of the magnitude of the focal length.  If all three constants of reproduction be achromatized, then the Gaussian image for all distances of objects is the same for the two colors, and the system is said to be in ''stable achromatism.''

In practice it is more advantageous (after Abbe) to determine the chromatic aberration (for instance, that of the distance of intersection) for a fixed position of the object, and express it by a sum in which each component conlins the amount due to each refracting surface.&lt;ref&gt;(see Czapski-Eppenstein, ''Grundzuge der Theorie der optischen Instrumente'', p. 170; A. Konig in M. v. Rohr's collection, ''Die Bilderzeugung'', p. 340)&lt;/ref&gt;  In a plane containing the image point of one color, another colour produces a disk of confusion; this is similar to the confusion caused by two ''zones'' in spherical aberration.  For infinitely distant objects the radius Of the chromatic disk of confusion is proportional to the linear aperture, and independent of the focal length (''vide supra'', ''Monochromatic Aberration of the Axis Point''); and since this disk becomes the less harmful with an increasing image of a given object, or with increasing focal length, it follows that the deterioration of the image is proportional to the ratio of the aperture to the focal length, i.e. the ''relative aperture.'' (This explains the gigantic focal lengths in vogue before the discovery of achromatism.)

Examples:
:'''(a)''' In a very thin lens, in air, only one constant of reproduction is to be observed, since the focal length and the distance of the focal point are equal.  If the refractive index for one color be &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, and for another &lt;math&gt;n+dn&lt;/math&gt;, and the powers, or reciprocals of the focal lengths, be &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f+df&lt;/math&gt;, then (1) &lt;math&gt;df/f=dn/(n-1)=1/n&lt;/math&gt;; &lt;math&gt;dn&lt;/math&gt; is called the dispersion, and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; the dispersive power of the glass.

:'''(b)''' Two thin lenses in contact: let &lt;math&gt;f_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f_2&lt;/math&gt; be the powers corresponding to the lenses of refractive indices &lt;math&gt;n_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n_2&lt;/math&gt; and radii &lt;math&gt;r'_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;r''_1&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;r'_2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;r''_2&lt;/math&gt; respectively; let &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; denote the total power, and &lt;math&gt;df&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;dn_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;dn_2&lt;/math&gt; the changes of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;n_1&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;n_2&lt;/math&gt; with the color.  Then the following relations hold:

::(2) &lt;math&gt;f=f_1-f_2=(n_1-1)(1/r'_1-1/r''_1)+(n2-1)(1/r'_2-1/r''_2)=(n_1-1)k_1+(n_2-1)k_2&lt;/math&gt;; and

::(3) &lt;math&gt;df=k_1dn_1+k_2dn_2&lt;/math&gt;.  For achromatism &lt;math&gt;df=0&lt;/math&gt;, hence, from (3),

::(4) &lt;math&gt;k_1/k_2=-dn_2/dn_1&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;f_1/f_2=-n_1/n_2&lt;/math&gt;.  Therefore &lt;math&gt;f_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f_2&lt;/math&gt; must have different algebraic signs, or the system must be composed of a collective and a dispersive lens.  Consequently the powers of the two must be different (in order that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; be not zero (equation 2)), and the dispersive powers must also be different (according to 4).

Newton failed to perceive the existence of media of different dispersive powers required by achromatism; consequently he constructed large reflectors instead of refractors.  James Gregory and Leonhard Euler arrived at the correct view from a false conception of the achromatism of the eye; this was determined by Chester More Hall in 1728, Klingenstierna in 1754 and by Dollond in 1757, who constructed the celebrated achromatic telescopes. (See [[telescope]].)

Glass with weaker dispersive power (greater &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;) is named ''[[Crown glass (optics)|crown glass]]''; that with greater dispersive power, ''[[flint glass]]''. For the construction of an achromatic collective lens (&lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; positive) it follows, by means of equation (4), that a collective lens I. of crown glass and a dispersive lens II. of flint glass must be chosen; the latter, although the weaker, corrects the other chromatically by its greater dispersive power.  For an achromatic dispersive lens the converse must be adopted.  This is, at the present day, the ordinary type, e.g., of telescope objective (fig. 10); the values of the four radii must satisfy the equations (2) and (4). Two other conditions may also be postulated: one is always the elimination of the aberration on the axis; the second either the ''Herschel'' or ''Fraunhofer Condition,'' the latter being the best vide supra, ''Monochromatic Aberration'').  In practice, however, it is often more useful to avoid the second condition by making the lenses have contact, i.e. equal radii.  According to P. Rudolph (Eder's Jahrb. f.  Photog., 1891, 5, p.&amp;nbsp;225; 1893, 7, p.&amp;nbsp;221), cemented objectives of thin lenses permit the elimination of spherical aberration on the axis, if, as above, the collective lens has a smaller refractive index; on the other hand, they permit the elimination of astigmatism and curvature of the field, if the collective lens has a greater refractive index (this follows from the Petzval equation; see L. Seidel, Astr.  Nachr., 1856, p.&amp;nbsp;289).  Should the cemented system be positive, then the more powerful lens must be positive; and, according to (4), to the greater power belongs the weaker dispersive power (greater &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;), that is to say, crown glass; consequently the crown glass must have the greater refractive index for astigmatic and plane images.  In all earlier kinds of glass, however, the dispersive power increased with the refractive index; that is, &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; decreased as &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; increased; but some of the Jena glasses by E. Abbe and O. Schott were crown glasses of high refractive index, and achromatic systems from such crown glasses, with flint glasses of lower refractive index, are called the ''new achromats,'' and were employed by P. Rudolph in the first ''anastigmats'' (photographic objectives).

Instead of making &lt;math&gt;df&lt;/math&gt; vanish, a certain value can be assigned to it which will produce, by the addition of the two lenses, any desired chromatic deviation, e.g. sufficient to eliminate one present in other parts of the system.  If the lenses I. and II. be cemented and have the same refractive index for one color, then its effect for that one color is that of a lens of one piece; by such decomposition of a lens it can be made chromatic or achromatic at will, without altering its spherical effect.  If its chromatic effect (&lt;math&gt;df/f&lt;/math&gt;) be greater than that of the same lens, this being made of the more dispersive of the two glasses employed, it is termed ''hyper-chromatic.''

For two thin lenses separated by a distance &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; the condition for achromatism is &lt;math&gt;D=v_1f_1+v_2f_2&lt;/math&gt;; if &lt;math&gt;v_1=v_2&lt;/math&gt; (e.g. if the lenses be made of the same glass), this reduces to &lt;math&gt;D=(f_1+f_2)/2&lt;/math&gt;, known as the ''condition for oculars.''

If a constant of reproduction, for instance the focal length, be made equal for two colors, then it is not the same for other colors, if two different glasses are employed.  For example, the condition for achromatism (4) for two thin lenses in contact is fulfilled in only one part of the spectrum, since &lt;math&gt;dn_2/dn_1&lt;/math&gt; varies within the spectrum.  This fact was first ascertained by J. Fraunhofer, who defined the colors by means of the dark lines in the solar spectrum; and showed that the ratio of the dispersion of two glasses varied about 20% from the red to the violet (the variation for glass and water is about 50%).  If, therefore, for two colors, a and b, &lt;math&gt;f_a=f_b=f&lt;/math&gt;, then for a third color, c, the focal length is different; that is, if c lies between a and b, then &lt;math&gt;f_c&lt;f&lt;/math&gt;, and vice versa; these algebraic results follow from the fact that towards the red the dispersion of the positive crown glass preponderates, towards the violet that of the negative flint.  These chromatic errors of systems, which are achromatic for two colors, are called the ''secondary spectrum,'' and depend upon the aperture and focal length in the same manner as the primary chromatid errors do.

In fig. 11, taken from M. von Rohr's ''Theorie und Geschichte des photographischen Objectivs'', the abscissae are focal lengths, and the ordinates wavelengths. The [[Fraunhofer line]]s used are shown in the table to the right of the figure.

and the focal lengths are made equal for the lines C and F. In the neighborhood of 550&amp;nbsp;nm the tangent to the curve is parallel to the axis of wave-lengths; and the focal length varies least over a fairly large range of color, therefore in this neighborhood the color union is at its best.  Moreover, this region of the spectrum is that which appears brightest to the human eye, and consequently this curve of the secondary on spectrum, obtained by making &lt;math&gt;f_C=f_F&lt;/math&gt;, is, according to the experiments of Sir G. G. Stokes (Proc.  Roy. Soc., 1878), the most suitable for visual instruments (''optical achromatism,'').  In a similar manner, for systems used in photography, the vertex of the color curve must be placed in the position of the maximum sensibility of the plates; this is generally supposed to be at G'; and to accomplish this the F and violet mercury lines are united.  This artifice is specially adopted in objectives for astronomical photography (''pure actinic achromatism'').  For ordinary photography, however, there is this disadvantage: the image on the focusing-screen and the correct adjustment of the photographic sensitive plate are not in register; in astronomical photography this difference is constant, but in other kinds it depends on the distance of the objects.  On this account the lines D and G' are united for ordinary photographic objectives; the optical as well as the actinic image is chromatically inferior, but both lie in the same place; and consequently the best correction lies in F (this is known as the ''actinic correction'' or ''freedom from chemical focus'').

Should there be in two lenses in contact the same focal lengths for three colours a, b, and c, i.e. &lt;math&gt;f_a=f_b=f_c=f&lt;/math&gt;, then the relative partial dispersion &lt;math&gt;(n_c-n_b)(n_a-n_b)&lt;/math&gt; must be equal for the two kinds of glass employed.  This follows by considering equation (4) for the two pairs of colors ac and bc. Until recently no glasses were known with a proportional degree of absorption; but R. Blair (Trans. Edin. Soc., 1791, 3, p.&amp;nbsp;3), P. Barlow, and F. S. Archer overcame the difficulty by constructing fluid lenses between glass walls.  Fraunhofer prepared glasses which reduced the secondary spectrum; but permanent success was only assured on the introduction of the Jena glasses by E. Abbe and O. Schott.  In using glasses not having proportional dispersion, the deviation of a third colour can be eliminated by two lenses, if an interval be allowed between them; or by three lenses in contact, which may not all consist of the old glasses.  In uniting three colors an ''achromatism of a higher order'' is derived; there is yet a residual ''tertiary spectrum,'' but it can always be neglected.

The Gaussian theory is only an approximation; monochromatic or spherical aberrations still occur, which will be different for different colors; and should they be compensated for one color, the image of another color would prove disturbing.  The most important is the chromatic difference of aberration of the axis point, which is still present to disturb the image, after par-axial rays of different colors are united by an appropriate combination of glasses.  If a collective system be corrected for the axis point for a definite wave-length, then, on account of the greater dispersion in the negative components — the flint glasses, — over-correction will arise for the shorter wavelengths (this being the error of the negative components), and under-correction for the longer wave-lengths (the error of crown glass lenses preponderating in the red).  This error was treated by Jean le Rond d'Alembert, and, in special detail, by C. F. Gauss.  It increases rapidly with the aperture, and is more important with medium apertures than the secondary spectrum of par-axial rays; consequently, spherical aberration must be eliminated for two colors, and if this be impossible, then it must be eliminated for those particular wave-lengths which are most effectual for the instrument in question (a graphical representation of this error is given in M. von Rohr, ''Theorie und Geschichte des photographischen Objectivs'').

The condition for the reproduction of a surface element in the place of a sharply reproduced point — the constant of the sine relationship must also be fulfilled with large apertures for several colors.  E. Abbe succeeded in computing microscope objectives free from error of the axis point and satisfying the sine condition for several colors, which therefore, according to his definition, were ''aplanatic for several colors''; such systems he termed ''[[apochromatic]]''.  While, however, the magnification of the individual zones is the same, it is not the same for red as for blue; and there is a chromatic difference of magnification.  This is produced in the same amount, but in the opposite sense, by the oculars, which Abbe used with these objectives (''compensating oculars''), so that it is eliminated in the image of the whole microscope.  The best telescope objectives, and photographic objectives intended for three-color work, are also apochromatic, even if they do not possess quite the same quality of correction as microscope objectives do.  The chromatic differences of other errors of reproduction have seldom practical importances.

'''Amy Lee Grant''' (born November 25, 1960) is an [[United States|American]] [[singer-songwriter]], [[musician]], [[author]], [[media personality]] and [[actress]], best known for her [[Christian music]]. She has been referred to as &quot;The Queen of Christian Pop&quot;. As of 2009, Grant remains the best-selling contemporary Christian music singer ever, having sold over 30 million units worldwide.

Grant made her debut as a teenager, and gained fame in [[Christian music]] during the 1980s with such hits as &quot;Father's Eyes,&quot; &quot;[[El Shaddai (song)|El Shaddai]]&quot;, and &quot;[[Angels (Amy Grant song)|Angels]]&quot;. In 1986, she scored her first number one charting [[Billboard Hot 100]] hit song in a duet with Peter Cetera [[The Next Time I Fall]]. During the 1980s and 1990s, she became one of the first gospel artists to [[Crossover (music)|cross over]] into mainstream pop on the heels of her successful albums ''[[Unguarded]]'' and ''[[Heart in Motion]]'', the latter of which included the number-one single &quot;[[Baby Baby (Amy Grant song)|Baby Baby]].&quot;

Grant has won six [[Grammy Award]]s, 25 [[Gospel Music Association]] [[Dove Award]]s, and had the first Christian album ever to go [[Platinum album|Platinum]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cnn&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0312/06/lkl.00.html|title=Interview With Amy Grant, Vince Gill|accessdate=August 29, 2008|publisher=[[CNN]]|year=2003|author=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Heart in Motion'' is her highest selling album, with over five million copies sold in the United States alone. She was honored with a star on [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] in 2005 for her contributions to the entertainment industry.

==Biography==
===Early years===
Grant (born in [[Augusta, Georgia]]) is the youngest of four sisters. She and her family settled in [[Nashville, Tennessee]] in 1967.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mosaic&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Amy|first=Grant|title=Mosaic: Pieces of My Life So Far|year=2007|publisher=Flying Dolphin Press|isbn=0-385-52289-4|pages=198–203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During 1976, Grant wrote her first song (&quot;Mountain Man&quot;), performed in public for the first time—at [[Harpeth Hall School]]—the all-girls school she attended, recorded a demo tape for her parents with church youth-leader [[Brown Bannister]], then later when Bannister was dubbing a copy of the tape, [[Chris Christian]], the owner of the recording studio, heard the demo and called [[Word Records]]. He played it over the phone, and she was offered a recording contract, five weeks before her 16th birthday. In 1977, she recorded her first album titled ''[[Amy Grant (album)|Amy Grant]]'', produced by Brown Bannister (who would also produce her next 11 albums). It was released in the Spring of 1978, one month before her high school graduation. That fall she performed her first ticketed concert—in Fort Worth, Texas—after beginning her freshman year at [[Furman University]]. In May 1979, while at the album release party for her second album, ''[[My Father's Eyes (album)|My Father's Eyes]]'', Grant met [[Gary Chapman (musician)|Gary Chapman]], writer of the title track (and future husband). Grant &amp; Chapman toured together the summer of 1979. In the fall of 1980, she transferred to [[Vanderbilt University]], where she was a member of the sorority [[Kappa Alpha Theta]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Mosaic&quot;/&gt; Grant then made a few more albums before dropping out of college to pursue a career in music—''[[Never Alone]]'', followed by a pair of live albums in 1981 (''[[Amy Grant in Concert]]'' and ''[[In Concert Volume Two (Amy Grant album)|In Concert Volume Two]]''), both backed by an augmented edition of the [[DeGarmo and Key|DeGarmo &amp; Key]] band. It was during these early shows that Grant also established one of her concert trademarks: performing barefoot. To date, Grant continues to take off her shoes midway through performances, as she has said &quot;it is just more comfortable.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Preston and Steve'' radio show excerpt; May 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://feet.thefuntimesguide.com/2008/05/celebrity_barefoot_in_public.php feet.thefuntimesguide.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

1982 saw the release of her breakthrough album ''[[Age to Age]]''. The album contains the signature track, &quot;[[El Shaddai (song)|El Shaddai]]&quot; (written by [[Michael Card]]) and the Grant-Chapman penned song, &quot;In a Little While&quot;. &quot;El Shaddai&quot; was later awarded one of the &quot;[[Songs of the Century]]&quot; by the [[RIAA]] in 2001. Grant received her first [[Grammy Award]] for Best Contemporary Gospel Performance, as well as two [[GMA Dove Awards]] for Gospel Artist of the Year and Pop/Contemporary Album of the Year. ''Age to Age'' became the first Christian album by a solo artist to be certified gold (1983) and the first Christian album to be certified platinum (1985).&lt;ref name=&quot;cnn&quot;/&gt;

In the mid-1980s, Grant began touring and recording with young up-and-coming songwriter [[Michael W. Smith]]. Grant and Smith continue to have a strong friendship and creative relationship, often writing songs for or contributing vocals to each other's albums. During the 1980s, Grant was also a backup singer for [[Bill Gaither (gospel singer)|Bill Gaither]].&lt;ref name=&quot;billgaither&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.americanprofile.com/article/5501.html|title=Bill  Gaither: The Gospel of Giving|accessdate=April 25, 2009|publisher=American Profile|author=Beverly Keel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grant followed up this album with the first of her Christmas albums - albums that later would be the basis for her trademark holiday shows. In 1984, she released another pop-oriented Christian hit, ''[[Straight Ahead (Amy Grant album)|Straight Ahead]],'' earning Grant her first appearance at the [[Grammy Awards]] show in 1985. The head of [[NBC]] took notice of Grant's performance and called her manager to book her for her own Christmas special.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mosaic&quot;/&gt;

===Widening audience===
Hardly had Grant established herself as the &quot;Queen of Christian Pop&quot; when she changed directions to widen her fan base (and hence her musical message). Her goal was to become the first Christian singer-songwriter who was also successful as a contemporary pop singer.&lt;ref name=&quot;rollingstone&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://smallproblem.com/grant/amygrant.pdf|format=PDF|title=Grant Wants To Put God On Pop Charts|accessdate=May 18, 2008|publisher=Rolling Stone|year=1985|author=Michael Goldberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Unguarded]]'' (1985) surprised some fans for its very mainstream sound (and Grant's leopard-print jacket, in four poses for four different covers). &quot;[[Find a Way]]&quot;, from ''Unguarded'', became the first Christian song to hit [[The Billboard Hot 100|Billboard's Top 40]] list, also reaching #7 on the [[Adult Contemporary]] chart. Amy Grant scored her first Billboard Number One hit in 1986 with &quot;[[The Next Time I Fall]]&quot;, a duet with former [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]] singer/bassist [[Peter Cetera]]. That year, she also recorded a duet with singer [[Randy Stonehill]] for his ''[[Love Beyond Reason]]'' album, entitled &quot;I Could Never Say Goodbye&quot;, and recorded ''The Animals' Christmas'' with [[Art Garfunkel]].

''[[Lead Me On (Amy Grant album)|Lead Me On]]'' (1988) contained many songs that were about Christianity and love relationships, but some interpreted it as not being an obviously &quot;Christian&quot; record. Years later, ''Lead Me On'' would be chosen as the greatest Contemporary Christian album of all time by ''[[CCM Magazine]]''. The mainstream song &quot;Saved by Love&quot; was a minor hit, receiving airplay on radio stations featuring the newly emerging Adult Contemporary format. The album's title song received some pop radio airplay and [[Crossover (music)|crossed over]] to #96 on the Billboard Hot 100, and &quot;1974 (We Were Young)&quot; and &quot;Saved By Love&quot; also charted as Adult Contemporary songs. In 1989 she appeared in a [[Target Corporation|Target]] ad campaign, performing songs off the album.&lt;ref name=&quot;target&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3092/is_n19_v28/ai_8089589|title=Rabbit stars in Target holiday promo - Target Stores Inc., Velveteen Rabbit|accessdate=August 29, 2008|publisher=Gale Group|year=1989|author=Gale Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the mainstream===
[[File:Amy Grant in 1998.jpg|thumb |Grant during her ''Behind the Eyes'' tour in 1998.]]
When ''[[Heart in Motion]]'' was released in 1991, many fans were surprised that the album was so clearly one of contemporary [[pop music]]. Grant's desire to widen her audience was frowned upon by the confines of the popular definitions of ministry at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;fans&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://amygrant.offramp.org/info/articles/him/5.html#t|title=Christian Fans Ask Too Much Of Amy Grant|accessdate=August 29, 2008|publisher=The Arizona Republic|year=1991|author=Kim Sue Lia Perkes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The track &quot;[[Baby Baby (Amy Grant song)|Baby Baby]]&quot; (written for Grant's newborn daughter, Millie, whose &quot;six-week-old face was my inspiration,&quot;) became a pop hit (hitting number 1 on the [[Billboard Hot 100]]), and Grant was established as a name in the mainstream music world. &quot;Baby Baby&quot; received Grammy nominations for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance, and Record and Song of the Year (although it failed to win in any of those categories). Four other hits from the album made the Pop top 20: &quot;[[Every Heartbeat]]&quot; (#2), &quot;[[That's What Love Is For]]&quot; (#7), &quot;[[Good For Me]]&quot; (#8), and &quot;[[I Will Remember You (Amy Grant song)|I Will Remember You]]&quot; (#20). On the Adult Contemporary chart, all five songs were top 10 hits, with two of the five (&quot;Baby Baby&quot; and &quot;That's What Love Is For&quot;) reaching #1. Many Christian fans remained loyal, putting the album atop Billboard's Contemporary Christian Chart for 32 weeks. ''Heart in Motion'' is Grant's best-selling album, having sold over 5 million copies according to the RIAA.&lt;ref name=&quot;riaa&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=2&amp;table=SEARCH_RESULTS&amp;action=&amp;title=Heart%20In%20Motion&amp;artist=Grant&amp;format=&amp;debutLP=&amp;category=&amp;sex=&amp;releaseDate=&amp;requestNo=&amp;type=&amp;level=&amp;label=&amp;company=&amp;certificationDate=&amp;awardDescription=&amp;catalogNo=&amp;aSex=&amp;rec_id=&amp;charField=&amp;gold=&amp;platinum=&amp;multiPlat=&amp;level2=&amp;certDate=&amp;album=&amp;id=&amp;after=&amp;before=&amp;startMonth=1&amp;endMonth=1&amp;startYear=1958&amp;endYear=2008&amp;sort=Artist&amp;perPage=25|title=Amy Grant - RIAA|accessdate=August 29, 2008|publisher=RIAA|year=2008|author=RIAA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grant followed the album with her second Christmas album, ''[[Home For Christmas (Amy Grant album)|Home For Christmas]]'' in 1992, which included the song &quot;[[Breath of Heaven (Mary's Song)]]&quot;, written by [[Chris Eaton (UK musician)|Chris Eaton]] and Grant, and would later be covered by many artists, including [[Donna Summer]], [[Jessica Simpson]] (who acknowledged Grant as one of her favorite artists), [[Vince Gill]], [[Sara Groves]], [[Point of Grace]], and Broadway star [[Barbara Cook]].

''[[House of Love (album)|House of Love]]'' in 1994 continued in the same vein, boasting catchy pop songs mingled with spiritual lyrics. The album was a multi-platinum success and produced the pop hit &quot;[[Lucky One (song)|Lucky One]]&quot; (#18 pop and #2 AC; #1 on [[Radio &amp; Records]]) as well as the title track (a duet with country music star and future husband [[Vince Gill]]) (#37 pop) and a cover of Joni Mitchell's frequently covered &quot;[[Big Yellow Taxi]]&quot; (#67 pop) (in which she changed the line &quot;And they charged the people ''a dollar and a half'' just to see em&quot; to &quot;And then they charged the people ''25 bucks'' just to see em&quot;).

Grant participated in Lifetime's 1st Annual &quot;Girls &amp; Guitars&quot; benefit, singing numerous songs, including a duet with [[Melissa Etheridge]] on &quot;You Can Sleep While I Drive&quot;.

After she covered the [[10cc]] song &quot;The Things We Do For Love&quot; for the ''[[Mr. Wrong (film)|Mr. Wrong]]'' soundtrack, ''[[Behind the Eyes (Amy Grant album)|Behind the Eyes]]'' was released in September 1997. The album struck a much darker note, leaning more towards downtempo, acoustic soft-rock songs, with more mature (yet still optimistic) lyrics. She called it her &quot;razor blades and [[Prozac]]&quot; album.&lt;ref name=&quot;pitt&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://amygrant.offramp.org/info/2001/50.html|title=Amy Grant's career comes full circle |accessdate=August 29, 2008|publisher=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |year=2002|author=Rosa Colucci}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although &quot;Takes A Little Time&quot; was a moderate hit single, the album failed to sell like the previous two albums, which had both gone multi-platinum. ''Behind The Eyes'' was eventually certified Gold by the [[RIAA]]. The video for &quot;Takes A Little Time&quot; was a new direction for Grant; with a blue light filter, acoustic guitar, the streets and characters of [[New York City]], and a plot, Grant was re-cast as an adult light rocker. She followed up &quot;Behind The Eyes&quot; with ''[[A Christmas To Remember]]'', her third Christmas album, in 1999. The album was certified Gold in 2000.

===Return to gospel===
Grant returned to her [[gospel music]] roots with the 2002 release of ''[[Legacy... Hymns and Faith]]''. The album featured a Vince Gill-influenced mix of [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] and gospel and marked Grant's 25th anniversary in the music industry. Grant followed this up with the pop release ''[[Simple Things (Amy Grant album)|Simple Things]]'' in 2003. The album did not have the success of her previous pop or gospel efforts. However, soon after ''Simple Things'', Grant and [[Interscope]]/A&amp;M parted ways. The same year, Grant was inducted into the [[Gospel Music Hall of Fame]] by the [[Gospel Music Association]], an industry trade organization of which she is a longstanding member, in her first year of eligibility. Grant released a sequel to her [[hymns]] collection in 2005 titled ''[[Rock of Ages...Hymns and Faith|Rock of Ages... Hymns &amp; Faith]]''.

===Looking ahead===
Although neither of her latest hymn releases have captured the popularity of her previous gospel career, Grant still remains a popular concert draw and enjoys popularity amongst both fan bases. For years in the 1990s and early 2000s, she toured in November and December for her Christmas and holiday tours. Often her husband and many special guests performed along with her on stage.

Grant joined the [[reality television]] phenomenon by hosting ''[[Three Wishes (TV series)|Three Wishes]]'', a show in which she and a team of helpers make wishes come true for small-town residents.&lt;ref name=&quot;tw&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/shows/dyn/three_wishes/series_about.jhtml|title=Three Wishes|accessdate=August 29, 2008|publisher=[[Country Music Television]], Inc.|year=2008|author=CMT}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show debuted on [[NBC]] in the fall of 2005 and was canceled at the end of its first season because of high production costs. After ''Three Wishes'' was canceled, Grant won her 6th Grammy Award for ''Rock of Ages... Hymns &amp; Faith''. In a February 2006 webchat, Amy stated she believes her &quot;best music is still ahead&quot;.

In April 2006, a live CD/DVD entitled ''[[Time Again...Amy Grant Live]]'' was recorded in [[Fort Worth, Texas]], at [[Bass Performance Hall]]. (Grant's first paid public performance was at the Will Rogers Auditorium in Fort Worth, TX.) The concert was released on September 26, 2006. In addition to receiving a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]], media appearances included write-ups in ''[[CCM Magazine]]'', and a performance on [[The View (U.S. TV series)|The View]].

In a February 2007 web chat on her web site, Amy discussed a book she was working on entitled ''[[Mosaic: Pieces of My Life So Far]]'': &quot;It's not an autobiography, but more a collection of memories, song lyrics, poetry and a few pictures.&quot; The book was released on October 16, 2007. In November, it debuted at #35 on the [[New York Times Best Seller list]].&lt;ref name=&quot;book1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/04/books/bestseller/1104besthardnonfiction.html?_r=3&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin|title=Hardcover Nonfiction|accessdate=December 6, 2007|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|author=[[The New York Times]] | date=November 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same web chat, Amy noted that she is &quot;anxious to get back in the studio after the book is finished, and reinvent myself as an almost-50 performing woman.&quot;

2007 was Grant's 30th year in music. She left Word/Warner, and contracted with EMI CMG who re-released her regular studio albums as remastered versions on August 14, 2007. Marking the start of Grant's new contract is a career-spanning [[Greatest Hits (Amy Grant album)|greatest hits]] album, with all the songs digitally remastered. The album was released as both a single-disc CD edition, and a 2-Disc CD/DVD Special Edition, the DVD featuring music videos and interviews.&lt;ref name=&quot;EMI&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.emicmg.com/press/printPress.aspx?id=529387|title=EMI Music Signs Worldwide Catalog Partnership with Amy Grant|accessdate=September 10, 2007|publisher=EMI Christian Music Group|year=2007|author=EMI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grant appeared with Gill on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'' for a holiday special in December 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;oprah&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oprah.com/tows/slide/200711/20071130/slide_20071130_350_101.jhtml|title=The Holidays, Country Style|accessdate=December 6, 2007|publisher=Harpo Productions, Inc.|year=2007|author=Harpo Productions, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grant has plans to appear on [[Country Music Television|CMT]], a [[Food Network]] special, the Gospel Music Channel, and [[The Hour of Power]].&lt;ref name=&quot;TV&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wespreadtheword.net/musicnewsarticles/tvalertamygrantcmtfoodnetworkspecialgospelmusicchannellhourofpower.html|title=TV ALERT: Amy Grant (CMT, Food Network Christmas episode of &quot;Paula's Party&quot;, Gospel Music Channel, Hour of Power)|accessdate=December 6, 2007|publisher=WeSpreadTheWord|year=2007|author=WeSpreadTheWord}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2008, Grant joined the writing team from [[Compassionart]] as a guest vocalist at the Abbey Road studios, London, to record a song called &quot;Highly Favoured&quot;, which was included on the album ''[[CompassionArt (album)|CompassionArt]]''.

On June 24, 2008, Grant re-released her 1988 album, ''Lead Me On'', in honor of its 20th anniversary. The two-disc release includes the original album and a second disc with new acoustic recordings, live performances from 1989, and interviews with Amy. Grant recreated the ''Lead Me On'' tour in the fall of 2008.

On June 27, 2008, Grant surprised everyone at the [[Creation Festival|Creation Northeast Festival]] by being the special guest. She performed &quot;Lead Me On&quot; and a few other songs backed with the [[Hawk Nelson]] band. At the end of the concert, Grant returned to the stage and sang &quot;Thy Word&quot;. She appeared on the 2008 album ''[[Anne Murray Duets: Friends &amp; Legends]]'' singing &quot;Could I Have This Dance&quot;.

In May 2009 for Mother's Day, Amy released an EP on iTunes containing two new songs, &quot;She Colors My Day,&quot; and &quot;Unafraid,&quot; as well as the older songs &quot;Baby Baby&quot; and &quot;Oh How The Years Go By.&quot;

During [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]'s [[D23 (Disney)#D23 Expo|D23 Expo]] in September 2009, [[Walt Disney Imagineering|Imagineer]] Steven Davison announced Amy Grant as the &quot;signature voice&quot; for the ''[[Disney's World of Color|World of Color]]'' hydrotechnic show at [[Disney's California Adventure Park|Disney's California Adventure]] theme park.

In 2010, Grant released ''[[Somewhere Down the Road (Amy Grant album)|Somewhere Down the Road]]'', featuring the hit single &quot;[[Better Than a Hallelujah]]&quot;, which peaked at No. 8 on Billboard's Top Christian Songs chart. When asked about the new album during an interview with CBN.com, Grant says, &quot;...my hope is just for those songs to provide companionship, remind myself and whoever else is listening what’s important. I feel like songs have the ability to connect us to ourselves and to each other, and to our faith, to the love of Jesus, in a way that conversation doesn’t do. Songs kind of slip in and move you before you realize it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbn.com/cbnmusic/interviews/amy-grant-somewhere-down-the-road-goodwyn.aspx Amy Grant: &quot;Somewhere Down the Road], ''CBN.com''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personal life===
Grant married fellow Christian musician [[Gary Chapman (musician)|Gary Chapman]] on June 19, 1982. Their marriage produced three children: Matthew Garrison Chapman (born 1987), Gloria Mills Chapman (called &quot;Millie&quot;, born 1989), and Sarah Cannon Chapman (born 1992), who was named after country legend [[Minnie Pearl]], a family friend. (Pearl's real name was Sarah Ophelia Colley Cannon.)&lt;ref name=&quot;orr-amy&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://amygrant.offramp.org/info/articles/sep/36.html#t|title=Amy starts over: Grant picks up pieces after divorce, with the help of her soaring career and, yes, Vince Gill|accessdate=August 29, 2008|publisher=John Lam|date=October 9, 1999|author=Jay Orr}} Article text from [[The Tennessean]] included in Lam's Amy Grant website.&lt;/ref&gt; Citing &quot;irreconcilable differences&quot;, Grant filed for [[divorce]] from Chapman in March 1999, and the divorce was final in June 1999.&lt;ref name=&quot;orr-amy&quot; /&gt;

On March 10, 2000, Grant married [[Vince Gill]], who had been previously married to country singer Janis Oliver of [[Sweethearts of the Rodeo]].&lt;ref name=&quot;meers&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20129901,00.html|title=Finally a Duet|accessdate=December 25, 2008|publisher=People Magazine|date=November 29, 1999|author=Erik Meers}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grant and Gill have a daughter together, Corinna Grant Gill, born March 12, 2001.&lt;ref name=&quot;people2&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20133970,00.html|title=In Perfect Harmony|accessdate=December 25, 2008|publisher=People Magazine|date=March 26, 2000|author=People Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the December 1999 ''Baptist Standard'', Grant explained why she left Chapman and married Gill:

&quot;I didn't get a divorce because I had a great marriage and then along came Vince Gill. Gary and I had a rocky road from day one. I think what was so hard—and this is (what) one of our counselors said—sometimes an innocent party can come into a situation, and they're like a big spotlight. What they do is reveal, by comparison, the painful dynamics that are already in existence.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;CCM1&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ccmmagazine.com/news/stories/11534814|title=Judging Amy|accessdate=December 28, 2008|publisher=CCM (Contemporary Christian Music)|month=March | year=2001|author=Gregory Rumburg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public views and perception==
Among praise for her contributions to the Contemporary Christian genre, Amy Grant has also generated controversy within the Christian community, from &quot;complaints that she was too worldly and too sexy&quot; to a &quot;barrage of condemnation&quot; following her divorce and remarriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C04E2D81F30F932A25756C0A9649C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=1 |title=Religion Journal; A Chastened Singer Returns to Christian Basics |accessdate=12 January 2009 |last=Rabey |first=Steve |date=May 11, 2002 |work=nytimes.com |publisher=The New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview early in her career, Grant stated &quot;I have a healthy sense of right and wrong, but sometimes, for example, using foul, exclamation-point words among friends can be good for a laugh.&quot; Within the same article, Grant expressed an opinion that those most opposed to premarital sex and rock music often base their views in part on having experienced emotional distress. &quot;'It seems to me,' she says as an after-thought, 'that people who are most adamantly against premarital sex have experienced some kind of pain in their own lives. Like the people who say absolutely no to rock 'n' roll. Chances are it has something to do with a past sadness.'&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://members.fortunecity.com/amygrantnews/articles/ung/8.html |title=Amy Grant: &quot;I'm Not a Prude.&quot; |accessdate=14 January 2009 |last=Jahr |first=Cliff |year=1985 |month=December |work=Amy Grant Article Archive |publisher=Ladies' Home Journal }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2006}}
{{Cleanup-rewrite|2=section|date=February 2009}}

===Settlement===
Before Aberdeen or Brown County was inhabited by European settlers, it was inhabited by the [[Lakota people|Sioux Indians]] from approximately 1700 to 1879. The first appearance of Caucasians was with the founding of fur trading posts during the 1820s; these trading posts remained operational until the mid 1830s. The first “settlers” of this region were the [[Arikara|Arikara Indians]], but they would later be joined by others.

The first group of Caucasian settlers to reach the area that is now Brown County was a party of only four people, three horses, two mules, fifteen cattle, and two wagons. This group of settlers was later joined by another group the following spring, and eventually more and more settlers migrated towards this general area which is currently [[Columbia, South Dakota]]. This town was established on June 15, 1879.

The majority of the settlers were Caucasian, with the next largest group being Native American, a trend that has continued to this day.

===Creation of the town===
Aberdeen, like many towns of the Midwest, was built around the newly developing railroad systems. Aberdeen was first officially plotted as a town site on January 3, 1881, by Charles Prior, the superintendent of the Minneapolis office of the [[Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad|Chicago, Milwaukee, and St. Paul Railroad]], or the Milwaukee Road for short, which was presided over by [[Alexander Mitchell (politician)|Alexander Mitchell]]. Mitchell, Charles Prior’s boss, was born in [[Aberdeen]], Scotland, after which the town of Aberdeen, South Dakota, was named. Aberdeen was officially founded on July 6, 1881, the date of the first arrival of a Milwaukee Railroad train. Aberdeen then operated under a city charter granted by the Territorial Legislature in March, 1883.

As Aberdeen grew, many businesses and buildings were constructed along Aberdeen’s Main Street. However, this soon became a problem due to Aberdeen’s “unique” geography; Aberdeen is, after all, referred to as “The Town in the Frog Pond”. At first, this unique condition presented no problem to the newly constructed buildings because it had not rained very much; but eventually, citizens would see how inconvenient the problem would become. During dry periods, this Frog Pond caused no trouble and was unnoticeable; but when heavy rains fell, the Pond reappeared and flooded the basements of every building on Main Street, causing many business owners and home owners much turmoil. When this flooding happened, the city had only one little steam pump that had to be used to dry out the entire area that had been flooded, which would take days, if not weeks – and more often than not, it would have rained again in this time period and caused even more flooding, even in the basements that had already been emptied of the water. And then, even once the water was gone from the basements, the city still had to deal with the mud that was also a result of the heavy rains. It was because of this Frog Pond that the city decided in 1882 to build an artesian ditch, which was later upgraded and developed into an artesian well in 1884 to combat the heavy rains and keep the basements from flooding. Even though the artesian well was designed by the city engineers to prevent flooding and develop a water system, this was not how things happened; during the digging of the well, the water stream that was found underground was too powerful to contain due to the built up pressure, which caused the water to come blasting out with violent force and soon had the entire Main Street under, in some cases, four feet of water. The engineers realized the previous flaws of the artesian well plan and soon added a gate valve to the well to control the flow of water, giving Aberdeen its first working water supply.

By 1886, Aberdeen had three different railroad companies with depots built in the newly developing town. With these three railroads intersecting here, Aberdeen soon became known as the “Hub City of the Dakotas”. When looking down on Aberdeen from above, the railroad tracks converging in Aberdeen resembled the spokes of a wheel converging at a hub, hence the name “Hub City of the Dakotas”. These three railroad companies are the reason why Aberdeen was able to grow and flourish as it did; however, only one of these railroads is still running through Aberdeen, the railroad today known as the Burlington Northern Santa Fe.

According to the census of 1900, Aberdeen had a population of 4,087; by the census of 1910, it had reached 10,752, an increase of 163 percent. It was from these censuses that Aberdeen was predicted to reach a population of 50,000 by 1920. However, this was not the case; the population soon began to decline. The estimated population in July 2006 was 24,071, a 2.4% decrease since 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.city-data.com/city/Aberdeen-South-Dakota.html Aberdeen, South Dakota (SD) Detailed Profile – relocation, real estate, travel, jobs, hospitals, schools, crime, news, sex offenders&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Community groups blame this decline on the flight of young adults and an increasingly aging population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.absolutelyaberdeen.com/investor3/regionalDev/ Absolutely! Aberdeen&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Aberdeen is the county seat of Brown County. The original county seat was, however, [[Columbia, South Dakota|Columbia]]. During the days of the railroad construction, plans were laid to bring the railroad through Columbia, then the county seat. When word of this spread, land in and around Columbia soared in price due to speculation. When time came for the railroads to purchase land, the increase in land prices led them to change their decision and instead to route the rail lines through Aberdeen. However, once Aberdeen became a town in 1881, there was a long-running controversy concerning which town would be the county seat, which continued until 1890, when it was declared by the newly formed South Dakota state constitution in 1889 that a majority vote could move the county seat if the county seat in question had originally been established by less than a majority vote. The result of the vote declared that Aberdeen would be the county seat once and for all, so all of the records were once again transferred to Aberdeen’s courthouse; during the battle for county seat, the records had been moved from Columbia’s courthouse to Aberdeen’s courthouse (which was built from 1886 to 1887), and back again to Columbia’s in what seemed to be a never-ending cycle of the transferring of records. This was typically done in the form of nighttime raids from the two towns.

===May 2007 flood===
During a 48-hour period beginning on the morning of Friday, May 4, and ending on the morning of Sunday, May 6, Aberdeen received {{convert|9.12|in|mm}} of precipitation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.keloland.com/blog/index.cfm?CommentID=505 KELOLAND.com Blogs&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; This rain flooded city streets, making many of them impassable for a short time, and caused water damage to many homes. Within 2 weeks of the storm, over 300 families had requested assistance from disaster response agencies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.disasternews.net/news/article.php?articleid=3178 Hundreds seek help in SD after flood – Disaster News Network&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; By May 25, 104 houses had been condemned due to the damage; of these, 47 were declared unlivable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aberdeennews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070525/FRONTPAGE/705250356/-1/RSS01&amp;rssfeed=RSS01 AberdeenNews.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Brown County, which includes Aberdeen, was declared a disaster area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aberdeennews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070527/FRONTPAGE/705270327/-1/RSS01&amp;rssfeed=RSS01 AberdeenNews.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
===Public schools===
The Aberdeen School District 6–1 has five elementary schools. These are C.C. Lee, Lincoln, May Overby, O.M. Tiffany and Simmons. The two middle schools are Holgate, which serves the north side of Aberdeen, and Simmons, which serves the south side of the city. There is one high school, [[Central High School (Aberdeen, South Dakota)|Central High School]]. The [http://www.hubarea.com/ Hub Area Technical School] is located in the district. Aberdeen also has an alternative middle and high school.

The Aberdeen School District’s enrollment for the year 2006–2007 was approximately 3,650 students, and the average class size was in the low to mid twenties. Due to a projected increase in enrollment and the modernization of facilities, Simmons Middle school will be significantly remodeled with the demolition of the original 1929 building and the addition of a new classroom and cafeteria building. The public school in Aberdeen is AA under the SDHSAA.

===Parochial schools===

'''Aberdour''' ({{Audio|Aberdour.ogg|listen}}; {{lang-gd|Obar Dobhair}}) is a scenic and historic village on the south coast of [[Fife]], [[Scotland]].  It is situated on the north shore of the [[Firth of Forth]], looking south to the Island of [[Inchcolm]] and its Abbey, and to [[Leith]] and [[Edinburgh]] beyond. According to the 2006 population estimate, the village has a population of 1,680.

The village's winding  main street lies a little inland from the coast. Narrow lanes run off it, providing access to the more hidden parts of the village and the shoreline itself. The village nestles between the larger coastal towns of [[Burntisland]] to the east and [[Dalgety Bay]] to the west.

== History ==

The origins of the village lie with its harbour, where the Dour Burn enters the River Forth. The place-name itself is [[Pictish language|Pictish]], implying an origin in the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]]: ''aber'' 'confluence'. The -dour element, referring to the Burn, means simply 'water' (archaic ''dobur''), and is unconnected to the Scots/English 'dour'. For much of its history Aberdour was two villages, '''Wester Aberdour''' and '''Easter Aberdour''', on either side of the Dour Burn. Although this distinction was blurred by the 19th century arrival of the railway.

In the 18th century Aberdour's harbour was improved by the addition of a stone pier to help handle the coal traffic from nearby collieries.  However, in the 1850s the traffic changed dramatically, and Aberdour Harbour became a popular destination for pleasure steamers from [[Leith]]. This in turn led to the building of a deeper water pier a little around the bay at Hawkhead, and to the development of hotels and many of the other services still on view today in the village.

The railway came to Aberdour in 1890, with the building of the line east from the newly opened [[Forth Railway Bridge]]. The [[Aberdour railway station|station]] has won many &quot;best kept station&quot; awards. The half an hour journey to the centre of [[Edinburgh]] helped build on the existing popularity of the village, though it put the steamers out of business.  The main result was a growth in the building of large and attractive houses, especially down the hill from Wester Aberdour to the West Sands. [[Ticket inspector]]s on the train line through Aberdour were known for their sing song refrain: ''&quot;Half an hour, Half an hour, Half an hour to Aberdour - tickets please.&quot;''

== Landmarks ==
[[Image:Aberdour Castle from dovecote.jpg|left|thumb|[[Aberdour Castle]]]]

Virtually between the two former settlements, though actually part of Easter Aberdour, lies [[Aberdour Castle]]. This started life as a modest 'hall house' on a site overlooking the Dour Burn in the 13th century. The oldest part of the present semi-ruin constitutes one of the earliest surviving stone castles in mainland [[Scotland]].  Over the next four hundred years the Castle was successively developed according to contemporary architectural ideas. Notable are the parts, still largely roofed, built by the Earls of Morton, with refined [[Renaissance]] detail, in the second half of the 16th century. A fire in the late 17th century was followed by some repairs, but in 1725 the family purchased 17th century Aberdour House, on the west side of the burn and in Wester Aberdour, and the medieval Castle was allowed to fall into relative decay. Aberdour Castle is now in the care of [[Historic Scotland]] and open to the public (entrance charge). After a period of dereliction Aberdour House was developed for residential use in the early 1990s.

[[Image:St Fillans Church -Aberdour -Scotland2.jpg|right|thumb|St Fillan's Church]]

Neighbouring St Fillan's Church is one of the best-preserved medieval parish churches in [[Scotland]], dating largely to the 12th century.  A south arcade was added to the nave in the early 16th century (open in summer). The [[A921 road|A921]], the main road along the south coast of [[Fife]], leads down the High Street of Wester Aberdour, before kinking sharply left to cross the railway line, then right again to progress through Easter Aberdour's Main Street.

Wester Aberdour has the more 'olde worlde' feel of the two, with the narrower through road more closely hemmed in by shops and hotels. A number of vernacular buildings of the 17th-early 19th centuries add to the historic scene. Close to the railway bridge, three lanes continue eastwards, presumably once the route of the original High Street before the arrival of the railway. One now leads to [[Aberdour railway station]], a beautifully kept and cared for example of a traditional station, in keeping with its role of transporting at least a quarter of the village's working population to their work each day.

A second lane leads alongside the railway line to [[Aberdour Castle]], while a third leads to the restored Aberdour House.  A little further west, a narrow road closely lined with high walls, Shore Road, leads down to the West Sands and the Harbour.  For many this area is the highlight of any visit to Aberdour; parking at the foot of Shore Road is usually at a premium.

Another road leads coastwards from Easter Aberdour. Hawkcraig Road leads past St Fillan's Church and through Silversand Park, home to [[Aberdour Shinty Club]], en route to the much better parking area on Hawkcraig, the overgrown and rocky bluff separating Aberdour's two bays. From here is it a short walk to the Silver Sands, Aberdour's busiest and most popular beach.

The Aberdour obelisk was built by Lord Mortimer on his departure from the village to relocate to a large home in Edinburgh, it was built so he could see his former hometown from his new house when he looked through binoculars - it stands in a cowfield between the castle and the beach.

== Festival ==

The yearly festival runs from the last week in July for a week, running into early August. It is now in its 27th year and is most notable for its marquee on the silver sands playing fields. The festival hosts a number of children's, cultural and local events. Acts that have performed at Aberdour festival have been Yard Of Ale, Percy &amp; The Peanuts, Swings &amp; Roundabouts, Capercaillie, Boys of the Lough, Eddi Reader and [http://www.fencerecords.com The Fence Collective's] Three Craws

The Donkey brae run is held on the first Sunday of the festival and is popular nationwide, with a 7-mile race, 2-mile run and a 1-mile run for children.

== Culture ==

Aberdour has a very popular yearly festival, which runs from late July to early August and features musical events, shows, sporting events and children's events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Craig Robertson |url=http://www.aberdour-festival.org |title=Aberdour festival |publisher=Aberdour festival |date= |accessdate=2010-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aberdour was a 2005 finalist in the prestigious &quot;Beautiful Scotland in Bloom&quot; awards. It was nominated for &quot;''Best Coastal Resort''&quot; in [[Scotland]] along with [[St Andrews]] in [[Fife]], [[North Berwick]] in [[East Lothian]], and [[Rothesay, Argyll and Bute|Rothesay]] in [[Argyll and Bute]].

== Aberdour's beaches ==

Aberdour is home to two beaches - The Silver Sands, and The Black Sands.

The Silver Sands is located on the East side of the village, and is one of Scotland's seven &quot;[[Blue Flag beach|Blue flag]]&quot; awarded beaches, which denotes an exemplary standard of cleanliness, facilities, safety, environmental education and management. New facilities are currently under construction by Fife Council, which will much improve the beach throughout the year. 

The Black Sands, as the contrasting name would suggest, has a rockier and darker sand, and is also popular with visitors exploring the rock caves and fascinating sea life. During the summer months (April–September), dogs are banned from the Silver Sands but are allowed all year round at the Black Sands. The two beaches are linked by part of the [[Fife Coastal Path]] which also takes you past the harbour and the Hawkcraig - a popular rock climbing location.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rockclimbing.com/routes/listArea.php?AreaID=7544 Rock Climbing Routes: Europe/Scotland/Central Lowlands/The Hawkcraig]{{Dead link|date=May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several scenes of [[Richard Jobson]]'s 2003 movie &quot;[[16 Years of Alcohol]]&quot; were filmed at The Black Sands in Aberdour.

== Inchcolm ==
{{Main|Inchcolm}}

The island of [[Inchcolm]], or Island ([[Scottish Gaelic language|Gaelic]] ''innis'') of [[Columba]], a quarter of a mile from the shore, forms part of the parish of Aberdour. Its name implies associations dating back to the time of [[Columba]] and, although undocumented before the 12th century, it may have served the monks of the Columban family as an '[[Iona]] of the east' from early times.

During the First and Second World Wars, [[Inchcolm]] was occupied by the army as part of the defences of the [[Firth of Forth]].  There are extensive remains of gun emplacements, barracks, etc. from these periods.

The island is notable for its wildlife, especially seabirds and seals. These draw many visitors in summer, along with the remains of the historic Abbey, and is a popular setting for weddings.

[[Image:Main Street, Aberfoyle.jpg|thumb|left|The main street in Aberfoyle]]
'''Aberfoyle''' ({{lang-gd|Obar Phuill}}) is a [[village]] in the region of [[Stirling (district)|Stirling]], [[Scotland]], {{convert|27|mi}} northwest of [[Glasgow]].

The town is situated on the [[River Forth]] at the base of [[Craigmore]] (420 metres high).  Since 1885, when the [[Duke of Montrose]] constructed a road over the eastern shoulder of Craigmore to join the older road at the entrance of the [[Trossachs]] pass, Aberfoyle has become the alternative route to the Trossachs and [[Loch Katrine]]; this road, known as the Duke's Road or Duke's Pass, was opened to the public in 1931 when the [[Forestry Commission]] acquired the land.

[[Loch Ard]], about two miles (3&amp;nbsp;km) west of Aberfoyle, lies 40 metres above the sea.  It is three miles (5&amp;nbsp;km) long (including the narrows at the east end) and one mile (1½&amp;nbsp;km) broad.  Towards the west end is Eilean Gorm (''the green isle''), and near the north-western shore are the falls of Ledard.  Two miles northwest is Loch Chon, at {{convert|90|ft}} above the sea, 1¼ miles (2&amp;nbsp;km) long, and about half a mile broad.  It drains by the Avon Dhu to Loch Ard, which is drained in turn by the Forth.

==Industry==
The [[slate]] [[Quarry|quarries]] on Craigmore which operated from the 1820s to the 1950s are now defunct; at its peak this was a major industry. Other industries included an ironworks, established in the 1720s, as well as wool spinning and a lint mill.  

From 1882 the village was served by [[Aberfoyle railway station]], the terminus of a [[Glasgow to Aberfoyle Line|railway line from Glasgow]] via [[Kirkintilloch]] and [[Strathblane]].  The station closed to passenger traffic in 1951, and the remaining freight services ceased in 1959.

The above industries have since died out, and Aberfoyle is supported mainly by the forestry industry and tourism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.undiscoveredscotland.co.uk/aberfoyle/aberfoyle/index.html Aberfoyle Feature Page on Undiscovered Scotland]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tourism==
Visitors were first attracted to Aberfoyle and the surrounding area after the publication of ''[[Lady of the Lake|The Lady of the Lake]]'' by [[Sir Walter Scott]] in 1810. The poem described the beauty of [[Loch Katrine]].  Aberfoyle describes itself as ''The Gateway to the Trossachs'', and is well situated for visitors to access attractions such as [[Loch Lomond]] and [[Inchmahome Priory]] at the [[Lake of Menteith]]. A tourist information office run by [[VisitScotland]] sits in the centre of town, offering free information, selling souvenirs and acting as a booking office for many of the local B&amp;B's and hotels. Aberfoyle Golf Club was built in 1860 and is located just south of town near the Rob Roy restaurant. Aberfoyle is also part of the [[Loch Lomond and The Trossachs National Park]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perthshire-scotland.co.uk/aberfoyle2.htm About Aberfoyle]&lt;/ref&gt;

Aberfoyle is also home to the largest Go Ape adventure course in the UK, featuring the longest zip-line in the UK.

==Historical figures==
Aberfoyle has connections to many historical figures such as [[Robert Roy MacGregor|Rob Roy]] and [[Mary, Queen of Scots]].  Robert Roy MacGregor was born at
