=== Australia ===
In [[Australia]], building societies evolved along British lines. Because of strict regulations on [[bank]]s, building societies flourished until the deregulation of the Australian financial industry in the 1980s. Eventually many of the smaller building societies disappeared, while some of the largest (such as [[St. George Bank|St. George]]) officially attained the status of banks.

Current building societies are
*[[ABS Building Society]]
*[[Greater Building Society]]
*[[Heritage Building Society]]
*[[Hume Building Society]]
*[[Lifeplan Australia Building Society]]
*[[Maitland Mutual Building Society]]
*[[Newcastle Permanent Building Society]]

=== Ireland ===
The [[Republic of Ireland]] had around 40 building societies at the mid-20th century peak.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ibf.ie/Libraries/Guides_Forms/bsnames_1.sflb.ashx&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these were very small and, as the Irish commercial banks began to originate residential mortgages, the small building societies ceased to be competitive. Most merged or dissolved or, in the case of [[First Active plc]], converted into conventional banks. The remaining building societies include:
*[[EBS Building Society]]
*[[Irish Nationwide Building Society]]
*ICS Building Society, owned by [[Bank of Ireland]]

=== Jamaica ===
In [[Jamaica]], four building societies compete with commercial banks and credits unions for most consumer financial services.

=== New Zealand ===
In [[New Zealand]], a number of building societies were established. Some, including [[Countrywide Bank (New Zealand)|Countrywide Building Society]] and [[United Building Society]], became banks in the 1980s and 1990s. Remaining building societies include
*[[Nelson Building Society]]
*[[Southland Building Society]], which moved in October 2008 to become a registered bank known as SBS Bank. However,it remained a building society and so retained its mutual structure.

===Other countries===
In other countries there are mutual organisations similar to building societies:
*'''Austria''': In [[Austria]] there are four co-operative banks: Allgemeine Bausparkasse (ABV), [[Raiffeisen Zentralbank|Raiffeisen-Bausparkasse]], Bausparkasse Wüstenrot AG and Bausparkasse der Sparkassen (savings bank).

*'''Finland:''' In [[Finland]] the [[Mortgage Society of Finland]], a permanent building society, was founded in 1860. Since 2002 mortgage loans are handled by [[Suomen AsuntoHypoPankki]], the licensed bank owned by the society.

*'''Germany:''' In [[Germany]] there are 11 Bausparkassen der [[German public banks#Sparkasse|Sparkassen]] ([[savings bank]]) named ''Landesbausparkassen'' (LBS) and 15 Bausparkassen of the [[private bank]]s, for example Schwäbisch Hall, Wüstenrot, Deutsche Bank Bauspar AG and so on.

*'''United States:''' In the [[United States]], [[savings and loan association]]s have a similar organisation and purpose.

==Operational differences from banks==
;Roll numbers:

Because most building societies were not direct members of the UK clearing system, it was common for them to use a '''roll number''' to identify accounts rather than to allocate a six-digit [[sort-code]] and eight-digit account number to the [[BACS]] standards.

More recently, building societies have tended to obtain sort-code and account number allocations within the clearing system, and hence the use of roll numbers has diminished. Nationwide is the most notable society to have discontinued the use of roll numbers completely.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationwide.co.uk/search/DisplayArticle.aspx?article=1053 Sort code and account number replaces roll number] {{Dead link|date=June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; When using BACS, roll numbers are entered into the Reference field whilst the building society's generic sort-code and account number would be entered in the standard BACS fields.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.experianpayments.com/glossary/roll-number.html Roll Number] at Experian&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Avro]] '''Blue Steel''' was a [[United Kingdom|British]] air-launched, rocket-propelled [[nuclear weapon|nuclear]] stand-off [[missile]], built to arm the [[V bomber]] force. It was the primary British nuclear deterrent weapon until the [[Royal Navy]] started operating [[Polaris missile]] armed nuclear submarines.

==Development==
[[Image:Avro blue steel front 9m07.JPG|left|thumb|Avro Blue Steel nuclear missile (front) at the [[Midland Air Museum]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.midlandairmuseum.co.uk/aircraft.php| title= Midland Air Museum|accessdate = 16 March 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[Image:Avro blue steel side 9m07.JPG|right|thumb|Avro Blue Steel missile (side view) at the Midland Air Museum behind the wing of an Avro Vulcan bomber.]]
Blue Steel was the result of a [[Ministry of Supply (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Supply]] memorandum from 5 November 1954 that predicted that by 1960 [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] air defences would make it prohibitively dangerous for V bombers to attack with nuclear [[gravity bomb]]s. The answer was for a [[rocket engine|rocket-powered]], [[supersonic]] missile capable of carrying a large nuclear (or projected [[thermonuclear]]) [[warhead]] with a range of at least {{convert|50|mi|km|abbr=off|lk=off}}. This would keep the bombers out of range of Soviet ground-based defences installed around the target area, allowing the warhead to &quot;dash&quot; in at high speed.

There would have to be a balance between the size of the warhead ([[Orange Herald]] or [[Green Bamboo]] as developed by the [[AWRE]]) and the need for it to be carried by any of the three V-bomber types in use, and that it should be able to reach Mach 3. The Air Staff issued this requirement for a ''Stand-off bomb'' as OR.1132 in September 1954.&lt;ref name=&quot;BSP&quot;&gt;Gibson Buttler ''British Secret Projects: Hypersonics, Ramjets and Missiles'' Midland Publishing 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ministry of Supply selected [[Avro]] out of the British manufacturers though it had no previous experience in working on guided weapons other than some private venture work; [[Handley Page]] had suggested a 500 [[Nautical mile|nmi]] missile but the [[Elliott Brothers (computer company)|Elliots]] gyro based guidance system was inaccurate beyond 100&amp;nbsp;nmi.
Avro began work proper in 1955, with the assigned [[Rainbow Code]] name of &quot;Blue Steel&quot; which it would keep in service. With Elliots working on the guidance system [[Armstrong Siddeley]] would develop the liquid fuel engine.
Its design period was protracted, with various development problems exacerbated by the fact that designers lacked information on the actual size and weight of the proposed boosted-fission warhead Green Bamboo, or its likely thermonuclear successor derived from the Granite series. The large girth of Blue Steel was determined by the {{convert|45|in|m}} implosion sphere diameter of Green Bamboo.

Avro proposed that Blue Steel would evolve over time, subsequent versions increasing speed (to Mach 4.5) and range. The ultimate Blue Steel would be a 900&amp;nbsp;nmi range weapon that could be launched by the supersonic [[Avro 730]] under development. They were told to limit themselves to the specification of OR.1132.&lt;ref name=&quot;BSP&quot;/&gt; The project was delayed by the need to develop the [[stainless steel]] fabrication techniques; this would have been gained in building the Avro 730 but that had been cancelled by then. Elliots guidance system was plagued by accuracy problems delaying test flights.

As it turned out, neither of the originally-proposed U.K.-designed warheads were actually fitted, being superseded by [[Red Snow]], an Anglicised variant of the U.S. [[B28 nuclear bomb|W-28]] thermonuclear warhead of 1.1 Mt yield. Red Snow was smaller and lighter than the earlier warhead proposals. The missile was fitted with a state-of-the-art [[inertial navigation]] unit. This system allowed the missile to strike within 100 metres of its designated target. In addition, the pilots of the [[Avro Vulcan]] or [[Handley Page Victor]] bombers could tie their systems into those of the missile and make use of the guidance system to help plot their own flight plan, since the unit in the missile was more advanced than that in the aircraft.

Blue Steel emerged as a pilotless, winged aircraft roughly the size of the experimental [[Saunders-Roe SR.53]] [[interceptor aircraft|interceptor]], with clipped [[delta wing]]s and small [[Canard (aeronautics)|canard]] foreplanes. It was powered by a two-chamber [[Armstrong Siddeley]] [[Armstrong Siddeley Stentor|Stentor Mark 101]] rocket engine, burning a combination of [[hydrogen peroxide]] and [[kerosene]]. The fuel was a considerable operational problem, because fuelling the missile before launch took nearly half an hour, and was quite hazardous.

On launch the rocket engine's first chamber developing {{convert|24000|lbf|kN|abbr=on}} thrust would power the missile along a predetermined course to the target at around [[Mach number|Mach]] 1.5. Once close to the target, the second chamber of the engine (6,000&amp;nbsp;lb) would accelerate the missile to Mach 3. Over the target the engine would cut out and the missile would free-fall before detonating its warhead as an [[Air burst]].

To speed the trials at [[Woomera Test Range|Woomera]], the test rounds were flown there by Victors and Vulcans in Operation Blue Ranger. The trials began in 1960 about the time the original requirement expected the weapon to be in service.

Blue Steel finally entered service in February [[1963 in aviation|1963]], being carried by [[Avro Vulcan|Vulcans]] and [[Handley Page Victor|Victors]], although its limitations were already apparent. The short range of the missile meant that the V bombers were still vulnerable to enemy [[Surface-to-air missile|SAMs]]. A replacement for Blue Steel, the Mark 2, was planned with increased range and a [[ramjet]] engine, but was cancelled in [[1960 in aviation|1960]] to minimise delays to the Mk.1. The UK sought to acquire the much longer-ranged [[United States Air Force]] [[AGM-48 Skybolt]] air-launched ballistic missile, and was greatly frustrated when that weapon was cancelled in late [[1962 in aviation|1962]].

With no effective long-range weapon the original Blue Steel served on after a crash programme of minor modifications to permit a low-level launch at {{convert|1000|ft|m|abbr=on}}, even though its usefulness in a hot war was likely limited. A stop-gap weapon ([[WE.177|WE.177B]]) was quickly produced to extend the life of the V-bomber force in the strategic role until the Polaris missile was deployed. This WE.177 laydown weapon supplemented the remaining modified Blue Steel missiles using a low-level penetration followed by a pop-up manoeuvre to release the weapon at {{convert|1000|ft|m|abbr=on}} Forty-eight live operational rounds were deployed on 48 Vulcan and Victor bombers plus a further five live rounds as operational spares. An additional four non-nuclear rounds were produced for various RAF requirements, and there were 16 other unspecified training rounds.

Blue Steel was officially retired on 31 December 1970, with the United Kingdom's strategic nuclear capacity passing to the [[submarine]] fleet.

The '''Branch Davidians''' (also known as &quot;The Branch&quot;) are a [[Protestant]] sect that originated in 1955 from a [[Schism (religion)|schism]] in the [[Shepherd's Rod|Davidian Seventh Day Adventists]] (&quot;Davidians&quot;), a reform movement that began within the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] (&quot;Adventists&quot;) around 1930. The majority of those who accepted the reform message have been disfellowshipped ([[excommunicated]]) due to the Adventist church rejecting it.

From its inception in 1930, the reform movement inherited [[Seventh-day Adventist eschatology|Adventism's apocalypticism]], in that they believed themselves to be living in a time when [[Bible]] prophecies of a final divine judgment were coming to pass as a prelude to Christ's [[second coming]]. The name &quot;Branch Davidian&quot; is most widely known for the [[Waco Siege]] of 1993 on their property (known as the [[Mount Carmel Center]]) near [[Waco, Texas]], by the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives|ATF]], [[FBI]], and [[Texas National Guard]], which resulted in the deaths of their leader, [[David Koresh]], as well as 82 other Branch Davidians and 4 ATF agents.&lt;ref&gt;''Waco:Rules of Engagement'' (Film Documentary)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;id=64mkTaGV4o4C&amp;dq=the+branch+davidians+of+waco&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=web&amp;ots=SkrS6bMT28&amp;sig=dZJYvV6wIlyKiVqMdHFw-_xs7CE&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ct=result The Branch Davidians of Waco.&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In 1929 [[Victor Houteff]], a [[Bulgaria]]n [[immigrant]] and a Seventh-day Adventist Sabbath School teacher, claimed that he had a new message for the church. He presented this message in a book, [[Shepherd's Rod|''The Shepherd's Rod: The 144,000—A Call for Reformation'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=The General Association of Branch Davidian Seventh Day Adventists |url=http://www.the-branch.org/Shepherds_Rod_Volume_1_Houteff |title=The Shepherd's Rod, Vol. 1 |publisher=The-branch.org |date= |accessdate=2011-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Adventist leadership rejected Houteff's message as contrary to the Adventists' basic teachings and disfellowshipped (banished) Houteff and his followers.

In 1935 Houteff established his headquarters to the west of Waco, Texas. Until 1942, the movement was known as the Shepherd's Rod Seventh Day Adventists. When Houteff found it necessary to formally organize for legal purposes, he named the association the General Association of Davidian Seventh Day Adventists. The term ''Davidian'' reflects their belief in the restoration of the Davidic kingdom&lt;ref&gt;Jeremiah 30; Ezekiel 37:21–28; Hosea 3:1 5.&lt;/ref&gt; in Israel before Christ's second coming ([[advent]]) in the clouds of heaven. Houteff directed Davidians to work exclusively for the reforming of Seventh-day Adventists, in preparation for a large influx of converts when the church was purified.

The Davidians believe that the president of the church must be endowed with the spirit of prophecy by which to bring increasing Biblical truth to the movement. Thus, in 1955, after Houteff's death, the Davidians split over who had the qualifications to lead the reform movement. This dispute brought about the General Association of Branch Davidian Seventh Day Adventists, headed initially by [[Benjamin Roden|Benjamin L. Roden]]. The name ''Branch'' reflects their belief that Branch is Jesus' new name.&lt;ref&gt;Zechariah 3:8–10; 6:12, 13; Revelation 2:17, 3:12.&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1960s, the group established its headquarters east of Waco, Texas, on the property previously occupied by the Davidians after they sold their property west of Waco in the early 1960s.

In 1958–59, The Branch became the first group of Christians to be granted [[landed immigrant]] status in [[Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;For the first time in the history of Zionist colonization, an organized Christian group has been granted official status in Israel as recognized immigrants and land settlers, with all the rights of material and moral aid involved. A year and a half ago, five families of Seventh-day Adventists from the United States and Canada immigrated to Israel to till the land and build new homes. They joined the cooperative village of Amirim in Galilee, where they were welcomed by Jewish peasants. The newcomers have now been recognized by the Settlement Department of the Jewish Agency....&quot; ''The Ministry'', Sept. 1960.&lt;/ref&gt; They received permission to settle three villages there, though they lost two of them because not enough Davidians came to inhabit the villages. Due to their efforts, along with those of others (mostly Jews), the remaining village, [[Amirim]], became the first [[Vegetarianism|vegetarian]] village in Israel, and remains such today. Being strict vegetarians, they established The Branch Organic Agricultural Association, one of the first organizations to encourage organic gardening in Israel, which produces an abundance of crops for the area and for Europe.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

At around the same time, Ben Roden called for the church to keep the [[Lord's Supper]] and all of the Biblical feast days. In 1976, he called for the General Conference of SDAs to keep the Lord's Supper daily, at the same times of worship that were designated in ancient Israel (the 3rd and 9th hours of the day). In 1981, [[Lois Roden]], Ben's wife, called for all members of the Branch to keep the Lord's Supper daily at those same times.

Although under the leadership of Victor T. Houteff the reform movement strictly confined its work among SDAs, under Ben Roden the work was extended outside the mother church.  Roden was especially vocal in his opposition to Sunday [[blue laws]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=The General Association of Branch Davidian Seventh Day Adventists |url=http://www.the-branch.org/Energy_Crisis_Sunday_Sacredness_Laws_Pope_Ben_Roden |title=The Energy Crisis and Sunday Sacredness |publisher=The-branch.org |date= |accessdate=2011-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=The General Association of Branch Davidian Seventh Day Adventists |url=http://www.the-branch.org/Protest_Sunday_Laws_Liberty_Of_Conscience_Ben_Roden |title=Protest Sunday Laws |publisher=The-branch.org |date=1975-04-07 |accessdate=2011-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=The General Association of Branch Davidian Seventh Day Adventists |url=http://www.the-branch.org/Sunday_Laws_Constitutional_Convention_Catholics_Lois_Roden |title=The Master Plan for America |publisher=The-branch.org |date= |accessdate=2011-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=The General Association of Branch Davidian Seventh Day Adventists |url=http://www.the-branch.org/Church_State_Separate_Sunday_Laws_Pope_Lois_Roden |title=Church &amp; State, Keep Them Separate |publisher=The-branch.org |date= |accessdate=2011-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=The General Association of Branch Davidian Seventh Day Adventists |url=http://www.the-branch.org/Church_State_666_America_Energy_Bill_Communist_Christianity |title=Wake Up America, Divorce These Two |publisher=The-branch.org |date= |accessdate=2011-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; which Adventists identify as being an aspect of the &quot;[[mark of the beast]]&quot;, as they support the concept of Saturday rather than Sunday worship.

In 1977, Ben Roden's wife, [[Lois Roden|Lois]], claimed to have a new message of her own, one element of which was the doctrine that the Holy Spirit is feminine in gender, causing much controversy in the group. That new message entitled her to a place in the leadership of the church, which her husband and others accepted. When Ben Roden died the next year, their son George tried to assume the leadership, claiming that he was the rightful prophet of the group. But Lois overcame his attempt, and a permanent injunction was issued against George, prohibiting him from attempting to act as president of the church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=The General Association of Branch Davidian Seventh Day Adventists |url=http://www.the-branch.org/Page6.html |title=The General Association of Branch Davidian Seventh Day Adventists |publisher=The-branch.org |date= |accessdate=2011-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, Lois Roden began publishing ''Shekinah'' magazine, which was a &quot;sounding board&quot; in which she presented articles from people of many different Christian, Jewish, and other backgrounds exploring the issue of the femininity of the Holy Spirit, and women in the ministry of the church. During the next several years she was written about in national and international newspapers, was on radio talk shows, and appeared on TV discussing her message. She distributed her literature at many different large religious meetings, including those held in various places when Pope John Paul II came to America in 1979.

In late 1982, and early 1983, she won an award from ''Religion in Media'', and from another international Christian group for her work and for her magazine. A couple of months later, the Administrative building at their church headquarters which contained their printing department was destroyed by fire. Vernon Howell (who changed his name to David Koresh in 1990) later admitted starting the fire. He said he did it because God had told him to do so, and that he was instructed to tell Lois that, &quot;the LORD hath given a commandment concerning thee, that no more of thy name be sown.&quot; Nahum 1:14.

While the SDAs, the Davidians, and The Branch hold many fundamental beliefs in common with most Christian denominations, there are a few additional doctrines which give each of them their distinct identities and names. The ones which the SDAs, the Davidians, and the Branch groups hold in common are:
# Saturday is the 7th day of the week, and, thus, the Sabbath of the Bible. That it is both a memorial of creation and a sign of sanctification, a sign of the believer's rest from his own works of sin, and his entrance into the rest of the soul which Jesus promises to those who come to Him.&lt;ref&gt;Gen. 2:1–3; 1; Ex. 20:8–11; 31:12–17; Heb. 4:1–10.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Jesus Christ is to soon personally return to earth to gather together his elect and take them to heaven for 1000 years, after which he will return with them to this earth to dwell with them for eternity in his kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Luke 21:25–27; 17:26–30; John 14:1–3; Acts 1:9-11; Rev. 1:7; Heb. 9:28; James 5:1–8; Joel 3:9–16; 2 Tim. 3:1–5; Dan. 7:27; Matt. 24:36, 44.&lt;/ref&gt;
# The non-immortality of the soul. That is, the dead have no consciousness, nor being.&lt;ref&gt;Eccl. 9:5, 6; Ps. 146:3, 4; John 5:28, 29.&lt;/ref&gt;
# There shall be a resurrection of both the just and of the unjust. The resurrection of the just will take place at the second coming of Christ; the resurrection of the unjust will take place 1000 years later, at the close of the millennium.&lt;ref&gt;John 5:28, 29; 1 Thess. 4:13–18; Rev. 20:5–10.&lt;/ref&gt;
# There is a sanctuary in heaven in which Christ is ministering on behalf of mankind.&lt;ref&gt;Heb, 6:19, 20; 9:1–28.&lt;/ref&gt;
# There is an investigative judgment going on in the heavenly sanctuary that began on October 22, 1844&lt;ref&gt;(at the end of the 2300 &quot;days&quot; of Daniel 8:14).&lt;/ref&gt; to determine who will come forth in each of the resurrections, and who will be translated without seeing death at the second coming of Christ.&lt;ref&gt;1 Thessalonians 4:13–17.&lt;/ref&gt; That said judgment began with the records of those who had died, and would eventually pass to the living.
# That the &quot;[[mark of the beast]]&quot;(Rev. 13:16–18) will be a universal decree enforcing the commandments and doctrines of men in opposition to those of the Bible, being primarily Sunday laws ([[Blue laws]]).
# The believer should recognize his body as the temple of the Holy Spirit, and thus the believer will be led to abstain from all intoxicating drinks, tobacco, and all other narcotics, and from unclean meats – vegetarianism being the optimal dietary practice.
# One identifying feature of the church is the presence of the Spirit of Prophecy.&lt;ref&gt;Amos 3:7; Rev. 12:17; 19:10.&lt;/ref&gt; Though the SDAs believe that the said gift was manifested in a special way through [[Ellen G. White]], they have not acknowledged any one as having the gift since she died in 1915.

The doctrines that distinguish the Davidian&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=The General Association of Branch Davidian Seventh Day Adventists |url=http://www.the-branch.org/Fundamental_Beliefs_Davidian_Seventh_Day_Adventists_Houteff |title=Fundamental Beliefs and Directory of the Davidian Seventh-day Adventists |publisher=The-branch.org |date=1904-09-21 |accessdate=2011-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Branch reform movements from the mainline SDAs are:
# The Davidian and The Branch messages both teach that the gift of prophecy is so important in the church that the president of the association must be endowed with it. Though the Davidians recognize that [[Victor Houteff]] possessed the said gift, they teach that no one will come with that gift again until the &quot;special resurrection&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Daniel 12:1, 2.&lt;/ref&gt; at which time both Ellen White and he will take up their work again. Yet that belief is contrary to Houteff's own teaching on the matter.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;...without the living Spirit of Prophecy in our midst there can be no success in any revival and reformation, and the sooner we know it the quicker we shall achieve our goal.&quot; Timely Greetings, Vol. 1, No. 10, p. 27. http://www.the-branch.org/Success_In_Revival_And_Reformation_Nehemiah_Haggai_Houteff&lt;/ref&gt; Those Davidians who believed that the gift of prophecy was given to Ben Roden after Houteff's death became part of the Branch.
# The church will be purified by the removal of the &quot;tares&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Matt. 13:30, 48, 49; Ezek. 9:6, 7.&lt;/ref&gt; fitting her for the final work of evangelism.
# After the purification of the church, the saints will return to the promised land where Christ will establish his kingdom&lt;ref&gt;(Dan. 2:44; Isa. 2:1–4; Mic. 4; Ezek. 37).&lt;/ref&gt; wherein the 144,000,&lt;ref&gt;Rev. 7:1–8.&lt;/ref&gt; those who follow the Lamb &quot;withersoever He goeth&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;(Rev. 14:4).&lt;/ref&gt; shall stand with Him on Mt. Zion,&lt;ref&gt;(Rev. 14:1).&lt;/ref&gt; and bring in &quot;a great multitude, which no man could number&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Rev. 7:9.&lt;/ref&gt; and there &quot;receive the forces of the GentiIes.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Isa. 60:5,11.&lt;/ref&gt; The kingdom there will exist for a short period of time as a final witness to the world before Christ comes in the clouds of heaven to take the great multitude of living and resurrected saints with him for 1000 years, during which time the saints will determine the degree of punishment due the unrepentant.&lt;ref&gt;Re 20:1–7.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Total abstinence from all flesh foods, in preparation for the return to the Edenic state of the kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Genesis 1:29; Isa 11:9, 65:25.&lt;/ref&gt;
# All of the Biblical feast days and practices the early church kept,&lt;ref&gt;1 Corinthians 5:7, 8.&lt;/ref&gt; and which were taken away from her in the centuries following the death of the apostles through the influence of pagan thinking supplanting the simplicity of the Gospel will be restored to the church, include the true keeping of the Lord's Supper. The Branch teaches that the time has come for the restoration of those feasts, the Davidians don't.

The doctrines that distinguish the Branch from the mainline SDAs and Davidians are:
# The judgment of the living began in the heavenly sanctuary in 1955.
# Daily worship should be kept at the 3rd and 9th hours of the natural day, in harmony with Christ's intercession in the heavenly sanctuary. This includes partaking in the Lord's Supper.
# The family is the literal image and likeness of the Godhead. The feminine aspects thereof being understood to be the Holy Spirit and Holy Ghost.&lt;ref&gt;Romans 1:19, 20; Genesis 1:26, 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Vernon Howell's (David Koresh's) affiliation with the Branch ==
In 1981 Vernon Wayne Howell (later renamed [[David Koresh]]) connected himself with the group after being disfellowshipped (excommunicated) from the SDA church in Tyler, Texas, for moral reasons. Shortly after that time he said that he had a new message for the church, but it was not received by anyone then. Rejected in his attempts to gain a following at that time, he came and went over the next year or so, only to return in early 1983, and then again in the fall of 1983 to try again. When there, he would offer Mrs. Roden his services in fixing cars and other mechanical problems, thereby gaining her trust.

Never at any time did he actually accept any of the basic moral teachings and practices of the Branch Davidian Seventh Day Adventists. The same type of things that caused him to be disfellowshipped from the SDA church would have disqualified him from membership in the Branch. The fact that he later had multiple &quot;wives,&quot; used alcohol and flesh foods (and taught his followers to do so), dealt in firearms, and used various questionable techniques to compel the consciences of his followers and break down their physical and mental powers, further disqualified him from membership in the church and its leadership.

In September 1983 Lois Roden allowed Howell to teach his own message, opening the door for him to build a following before their split in early 1984. It is the church's practice to allow most anyone the freedom to present a study, so as not to stifle the spirit of investigation. There was a general meeting at Mount Carmel Center of many Branch Davidians in 1984 during Passover, and the end result was that the group split into a few factions, one of which was loyal to Howell. At this time George Roden forced Howell and his group, and some others, to leave the property. Shortly before that time Howell named his faction the &quot;Davidian Branch Davidian Seventh-Day Adventist Association.&quot; Within about a year after leaving Mt. Carmel Center, Howell and his followers ended up in Palestine, Texas, which was his headquarters for the next couple of years. At Howell's command, his followers stopped distributing any of the Davidian and Branch literature after they joined him.

On March 28, 1985, Lois was in court again, enforcing the injunction against George. At that time she swore that she was the &quot;President of the Branch Davidian Seventh-Day Adventist Association.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=The General Association of Branch Davidian Seventh Day Adventists |url=http://www.the-branch.org/Page8.html |title=The General Association of Branch Davidian Seventh Day Adventists |publisher=The-branch.org |date= |accessdate=2011-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 2½ months later, Vernon Howell was involved in a separate court case in which he swore that he was the &quot;President of the Davidian Branch Davidian Seventh-Day Adventist Association&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=The General Association of Branch Davidian Seventh Day Adventists |url=http://www.the-branch.org/Page5.html |title=The General Association of Branch Davidian Seventh Day Adventists |publisher=The-branch.org |date= |accessdate=2011-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and named nine of his followers who were members of the Branch before they left it to join his new faction under its new name. That case was initiated by George Roden. He was claiming that Vernon and numerous others were preventing him from being the President of the Branch church. Vernon's defense against George's complaint was that he was actually the President of a different association, i.e., the &quot;Davidian Branch Davidian Seventh-Day Adventist Association.&quot;

While Howell and his followers claimed that Lois Roden had passed on, or had lost, her presidency to him, he never challenged her in court, nor did he attempt to exercise his purported right to the presidency and to the church's name and property until after she died in November, 1986. Though George had used his office of Trustee of the association to have Howell banned from the church's headquarters in 1984, Howell never used his alleged right to the leadership of the church to overturn George's action against him until after Lois died. Neither was he a party in the probate of Lois' estate in January 1987. Lois, as president of the church, held much of the church's property in her name in accordance with the church's ''Constitution and By-laws'', yet Howell was not at the probate proceedings to protect the church's property, which he could have, and should have, done if he were her lawful successor. Instead, in the following summer Howell began to file numerous documents&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=The General Association of Branch Davidian Seventh Day Adventists |url=http://www.the-branch.org/Page9.html |title=The General Association of Branch Davidian Seventh Day Adventists |publisher=The-branch.org |date= |accessdate=2011-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the County Records office, which he and his followers were to later use to exert their claim to the right to use the church's identity and property. In all of those document he assumed the church's name, rather than using the new name of his distinct faction, which he dropped at around that time.

Many of those nine persons named in Howell's statement regarding his being president of an association (&quot;Davidian Branch Davidian...&quot;) different from The Branch had been members of the church's ''Executive Council'' under Lois. But, it wasn't until after Lois died that they and Vernon used that fact to make it appear that they were still members of the association which Lois was president of in order to gain use of the church's identity and property, and to bring contempt charges against George, causing him to leave the church's property. Their names appeared on the original 1979 court order against George, so although they left the church under Lois to join with Howell, under the guise of still being members of the &quot;Executive Council&quot; they took legal actions against George after Lois died.

In early November, 1987, Vernon and seven of his followers made what the authorities described as a military style assault upon George in order to gain control of Mt. Carmel Center. It was reported that Vernon and his followers said that they were just trying to get some photographs of a dead body which George had dug up. They claimed that the District Attorney had requested that they get the pictures in order to prosecute George. That claim is questionable, because the sheriffs were well aware that George had dug up the body, for they had investigated the matter nearly nine months before that time when it was reported to them by Doug Mitchell (one of Lois' remaining followers) during the time of the probate of Lois' estate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=The General Association of Branch Davidian Seventh Day Adventists |url=http://www.the-branch.org/Page10.html |title=The General Association of Branch Davidian Seventh Day Adventists |publisher=The-branch.org |date= |accessdate=2011-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was reported that during their assault Vernon and his followers had more ammunition than &quot;a Vietnam patrol.&quot; They had hidden out in the ruins of the Administration building that Vernon burned down in 1983 until the morning when they were discovered and a shootout started between them and George. It reportedly went on for around 45 minutes before the sheriffs arrived. The sheriffs were conveniently met by Perry Jones (Vernon's father-in-law) outside of Mt. Carmel who said that they were just trying to take some pictures of the deceased woman. Vernon and those with him were put in jail, awaiting their trial on attempted murder charges. Vernon was bailed out while the others remained in jail. One of the officers who testified at the trial said that it appeared to him that Vernon and his followers were attempting to use the sheriffs in order to gain control of Mt. Carmel Center.

While waiting for the trial, George was put in jail under contempt of court charges on March 21, 1988 because of his use of foul language in some court pleadings. The very next day, Perry Jones and a number of Vernon's other followers moved from their headquarters in Palestine, Texas to Mt. Carmel Center.

At the trial, Vernon's group came with their children and gained much sympathy from the jury. The jury acquitted Vernon's followers. There was a mistrial declared for Vernon, and the charges against him were later dropped. All of their guns were given back to them.

Mitchell, the last church member in Waco to work with Lois before she died, had left there a week or so before that shootout, so there were no members of the church under Lois Roden in Waco who could testify at the trial in 1988 as to what was going on, other than George. Therefore, neither the jury nor the general public knew that Howell's leadership was of a completely different nature than that of Victor Houteff, and that of Ben and Lois Roden, who were well respected in the Waco community, or that he was actually the leader of a different association under a different name.

== Lois Roden's successor dispute ==
Lois also faced discord from Canadian Charles Pace, who joined the church in the early 1970s, and who, in 1981, also said he had a special message for the church. After examining Pace's message, and finding some errors in it, Lois asked him to stop teaching it among them. When he refused to do so, she put him under a &quot;censure,&quot; which meant that he could attend meetings of the church, but not teach at them. At the pivotal Passover, 1984 meeting, Pace presented his special message at a meeting held by George Roden. While Lois and others accepted the key point of Pace's teachings, the significant errors in it precluded Lois from publishing anything of his as he had presented it.

At that meeting, Pace announced that he believed that George was to be the next president of the church, and gave him around $14,000 so that he (Pace) could open a health center there. That, in spite of the fact that Lois had asked people to not give financial support to George who was still under the court order that enjoined him from acting as the church's president, and, thus, George had no authority to authorize Pace to open a health center. Shortly thereafter, Pace had a falling out with George, and he threw Pace off of the property.

After Lois' death in late 1986, Pace moved from Canada to Gadsen, Alabama, and set up his own faction which he at first named &quot;The Living Waters Branch of Righteousness,&quot; then later changed the name to &quot;The Branch, The Lord (YHVH) Our Righteousness.&quot; Though he claimed to be Lois' successor, he did not take part in the probate of Lois' estate, and thus allowed the church's property and identity to fall into the hands of George Roden, and then, eventually, Howell's.

In 1990, one of the first things Pace published under his new name was called ''It Is Finished''. Shortly before Lois died in November, 1986, he declared that the church no longer needed to keep the daily hours of worship which Ben and Lois had labored hard to restore to the church. In that 1990 study he taught that it was an &quot;abomination&quot; to keep wine (grape juice) as an emblem of the Lord's Supper daily (as the Rodens had taught) because Jesus was no longer interceding for us, but only the Holy Ghost was.

In Lois' unattested will she named &quot;Irmine Sampson, Teresa Moore, and the New York group&quot; to lead out in republishing her and Ben's literature. Teresa took that to mean that she was anointed to be the next president of the church, though the others didn't assume the same about their being mentioned. Teresa attended the hearing on the probate of Lois' estate in early 1987, but not as a party to it. After the hearing she told Doug Mitchell (who was a party to the proceedings for the purpose of preserving the church's assets from abuse until the members could meet together) that it was her opinion that the church members should just let George Roden have control of Mt. Carmel Center and the other church assets. Therefore, she went back home and established her own faction, naming it ''The Lords of Sabbaoth, Our Righteous Branches'', and abandoned the church's identity and property.

[[Amo Bishop Roden|Amo Bishop]] became associated with George Roden in 1987, and later was married to him for a few months by &quot;contract.&quot; George's mental condition was greatly deteriorating during that time, and not long afterwards he ended up in a mental institution until his death in 1998. Amo claims to represent the church, though she rejects many of the church's fundamental teachings. Even though she managed to get permission from George to represent his interests, he, not long afterwards, formerly withdrew that permission. In spite of that, Amo continues to put herself forward as a member of the church with a right to speak and act for the church, even using George's last name (Roden). She then began publishing her own studies, which, according to Mitchell and others, greatly misrepresent the church's teachings. Some say that she is part of a group whose purpose is to disrupt and manipulate the church's image for nefarious reasons. They say that she has been taking advantage of the church's turmoil by repeatedly moving on to the church's property and passing out her literature under the supposed auspices of the church.

Doug Mitchell joined the movement in 1978, and worked closely with Lois until her death. He became a party in the probate proceedings of Lois' estate for the purpose of preserving the church's assets from abuse until the members could meet together, but to no avail as the judge wouldn't recognize that much of Lois' estate was things held in trust by her for the church, and appointed two of her other sons who were not active in the church as executors of her estate.

About six months before she died, Mitchell presented her with some &quot;new light&quot; he said he was receiving on the true nature of the Lord's Supper. That being, that in the early church that which is known as the [[Agape]] or Love Feast (the communal meal ) was the only Lord's Supper they practiced. Lois accepted that belief and practiced it with Mitchell when they met together, and even with Pace when they visited him shortly before she died.

== Koresh group name controversy ==

There is an ongoing controversy concerning whether or not David Koresh and his followers truly represented the reform movement that had been in existence for over 60 years at the time of the siege, and whether or not they had a right to use the name and property of the church. Though his followers numbered around 140 at the time of the siege, only about 20 of them and their children were associated with the church before he drew them away to follow his unique teachings and practices. A much greater number of the loosely organized church rejected his claims.

By the time of the siege, Koresh had encouraged his followers to think of themselves as &quot;students of the Seven Seals&quot; rather than as &quot;Branch Davidians.&quot; During the standoff one of his followers publicly announced that he wanted them to thereafter be identified by the name &quot;Koreshians&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Mr. Ricks [FBI negotiator] said today that Ms. Schroeder had told him that members of the sect, a renegade offshoot of Seventh-day Adventists, henceforth wanted to be known as Koreshians.&quot; By Robert Reinhold, Published: March 15, 1993 ''New York Times'' [brackets added].&lt;/ref&gt; Other of his followers said they did not want to use that new name, and the vast majority of the media continued to use the name &quot;Branch Davidian,&quot; in spite of protests from other church members who did not leave the church to join Koresh's distinct offshoot. The Seventh Day Adventist Church with  world headquarters in Silver Spring, Maryland, was able to persuade the media to not use its name in conjunction with the Branch Davidians{{Citation needed|reason=How did the Adventist church 'persuade' the media? Where is this documented?|date=April 2009}} because they had not long before trademarked their name, despite the fact that the Branch Davidians had legally used the words &quot;Seventh Day Adventists&quot; in their name for decades before the Adventists had trademarked the name. Protests against the use of the name &quot;Davidian&quot; for Koresh and his followers were also raised by the Davidian groups who were not affiliated with the Branch, but also to no avail.

Due to overwhelming evidence that Koresh's teachings and practices were grossly divergent from those of the historic Branch Davidians, and that there are significant facts that his group was actually a separate and distinct association, this article addresses the church's identity independent of his teachings and the events of the 1993 siege. Those matters are addressed in the articles [[David Koresh]] and the [[Waco Siege]].

== Land dispute and status of the church today ==
[[File:mt-carmel-building-1-1995-05.jpg|250px|thumb|Building at Mount Carmel Center, 1995]]
Due to the secrecy under which Koresh operated, and because some of his original followers were using their former membership on the church's ''Executive Council'' to portray themselves as still a part of the Branch, those who never left the church under Lois Roden's leadership were not able to easily challenge Koresh's group until after their deeds and teachings were known publicly after the 1993 incident. The revelation of those things gave others the opportunity to dispute their hold on the Mount Carmel property and the church's identity. Within months Amo Bishop moved onto the land to begin a one-woman occupation.

After Koresh's death, most of his survivors and supporters recognized Clive Doyle as the spokesman of their organization. But, according to the church's Constitution and By-Laws, the Trustees of the church's property must be appointed to said positions by the president thereof, and Koresh had made no such appointments, nor did they even have a president since he died in 1993, and they announce publicly that they weren't expecting another one to come after him. This situation has existed until today. Therefore, in 1996, they filed a document in the County Records Office stating that they were reorganizing themselves outside of the parameters of the church's laws, and named 11 individuals as co-Trustees.

After the 1993 incident, some of Koresh's survivors filed a lawsuit in order to obtain their personal property that had been confiscated after the end of the standoff. In that suit they, almost incidentally, attempted to gain title to the church's property, Mt. Carmel Center. In 1996 the court ruled that the land belongs to the Branch Davidian Seventh Day Adventist Church, but refused to rule on who exactly constitutes &quot;the church.&quot;

Therefore, in 1996, a number of Koresh's remaining followers filed an action to quiet title to the church's property under a claim of ''adverse possession''. Adverse possession requires that the claimant file it against a party that holds title to the property. They filed that suit claiming to be the &quot;Trustees&quot; of the church, while contradictorily claiming that they possessed the property in ''adversity'' to the trustees of the church. The only defendants they named in the suit were George Roden, who was confined in a mental institution, and Amo Bishop. They also tried to conceal the fact that they were making a claim for the property by attempting to meet the public notification requirements by publishing their claim in the ''Waco Farm and Labor Journal'' that had only 1200 subscribers, and no general circulation at all.

Charles Pace and one of his followers joined the suit, alleging that they had rights to the property along with Koresh's followers because they had contributed to the church's &quot;2nd tithe fund,&quot; which had been used to acquire and maintain the property. He was petitioning the court to have it recognize all of the different factions and set up a board with representatives of the various groups to work together to determine how the property would be used.

In 1998, Doug Mitchell, joined the case in opposition to all of the parties. He says that he told Pace that since he was not a follower of Koresh's, that he would not file against him if he would withdraw from the case. Pace then withdrew from the case, but then signed a document in which he stated that he was fully recognizing Koresh's follower's claim to the property, and joined with them in their opposition to Mitchell. Mitchell contends that when Koresh left Mount Carmel in 1984 and adopted the new name &quot;Davidian Branch Davidian Seventh Day Adventist&quot; for his group, they formally left the church, forfeiting their claim as true Branch Davidians. And even more so, considering that during the property trial Koresh's surviving followers formally reorganized themselves outside of, and with specific disregard for the church's governing laws. He says the same is true of Pace when he formed his own group under its new name(s) and began to teach doctrines that are in direct opposition to the fundamental Branch teachings. Teresa Moore chose not to be a party to the suit, but during the proceedings she linked up with Amo Bishop in opposition to Mitchell.

During the pre-trial proceedings, Mitchell's attempts to obtain an injunction against Koresh's remaining followers that would have prohibited them from using the church's name and property was dismissed for &quot;lack of jurisdiction.&quot; Judge Alan Mayfield felt that the matter involved church issues which the court could not rightly consider. Mitchell asserts that none of the Judge's conclusions of law in his order were applicable to the case before him. He says that he was unable to appeal the judge's ruling at that time due to personal hardships and to harassment and violence he was subjected to by some of Koresh's followers and from Pace.

Koresh's survivors dropped their claim for ''adverse possession'' the day before the trial began, proceeding only on their claims of being the Trustees of the Church. Mitchell's claim to be the rightful Trustee of the church's property was not allowed to be heard by the jury when Koresh's followers' and Amo Roden's claims were considered, but he was allowed to defend himself against the others' claims. Even though Koresh's followers presented the numerous documents that they and Howell had filed in the County Records office in 1987 and later, in 2000 a jury ruled against them and Amo Roden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=The General Association of Branch Davidian Seventh Day Adventists |url=http://www.the-branch.org/Page12.html |title=The General Association of Branch Davidian Seventh Day Adventists |publisher=The-branch.org |date= |accessdate=2011-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=The General Association of Branch Davidian Seventh Day Adventists |url=http://www.the-branch.org/Page13.html |title=The General Association of Branch Davidian Seventh Day Adventists |publisher=The-branch.org |date= |accessdate=2011-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they continued to use the property, along with Charles Pace.

Approximately fifty&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cesnur.org/2005/pa_pitts.htm CESNUR 2005 International Conference – The Davidians, The Branch Davidians and Globalization, by Bill Pitts.&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; to seventy&lt;ref&gt;http://bdsda.tripod.com/newsletters/april_2005.html&lt;/ref&gt; people attended the yearly memorial service on April 19, 2005. At that time, survivor Clive Doyle was living at the Mount Carmel Center with supporter Ron Goins, operating a small visitor museum as well as holding weekly Bible studies on the Sabbath. Charles Pace and his family also lived on the property and held worship services.

However, relations began to break down. In August, Pace held a baptism for his members at Mount Carmel, joined by Goins. This left Doyle as the only Koresh follower on the property, and he says he came under increasing pressure to convert or leave. In February, 2006, he decided to move into town, emptying the visitor museum as well.

This has left Pace's group in questionable control of Mount Carmel Center. Pace had opposed the planting of the grove of memorial trees calling it paganism, and his group has chopped down David Koresh's tree and smashed his plaque, to prevent it from being used for idolatry. They have also removed the plaques from the other trees, with plans to incorporate the stones into their own memorial to the dead. Pace, a naturopathic doctor, also plans to make a wellness center out of Doyle's repossessed house and a health food/herb shop out of the visitors' center. Meanwhile, Koresh's survivors nurse hopes of reclaiming the property.

In 2003, Mitchell set up a web site&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=The General Association of Branch Davidian Seventh Day Adventists |url=http://www.the-branch.org/index.php |title=The General Association of Branch Davidian Seventh Day Adventists |publisher=The-branch.org |date= |accessdate=2011-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; on which he posted most all of the publications of Victor T. Houteff, Ben and Lois Roden, and his own new studies, including a detailed presentation of what he calls''The Warfare of Vernon Howell (a.k.a. David Koresh) and others against the Branch Davidian Seventh Day Adventists'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=The General Association of Branch Davidian Seventh Day Adventists |url=http://www.the-branch.org/Koresh's_Warfare_Against_True_Branch_Davidians_Doug_Mitchell |title=The Warfare against the Branch Davidian Seventh Day Adventists by David Koresh, and Others |publisher=The-branch.org |date= |accessdate=2011-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he gives a detailed and documented overview of the controversy regarding the church and its adversaries. Mitchell says that numerous people who have examined his teachings and those of Koresh's and his followers, Charles Pace, and Teresa Moore, and have found their teachings to be divergent from the fundamental doctrines of the church, and have sided with him. He says that the matter is far from resolved, and that certain facts may soon come to light which will clear up the matter.

'''Burwash Hall''' is the second oldest of the residence buildings at [[Toronto]]'s [[Victoria University in the University of Toronto|Victoria College]].  Construction began in 1911 and was completed in 1913.  It was named after [[Nathanael Burwash]], a former president of Victoria.  The building is an extravagant [[Neo-Gothic]] work with [[turret]]s, [[gargoyle]]s, and [[battlement]]s.  The architect was [[Henry Sproatt]].  

The building is divided between the large dining hall in the northwest and the student residence proper.  The residence area is divided into two sections.  The Upper Houses, built in 1913, consist of four houses: North House, [[Middle House]], [[Gate House]], and [[South House]].   The Lower Houses were built in 1931 and were originally intended to house theology students at Emmanuel College, whose current building was opened the same year.  Ryerson House, Nelles House, Caven House, Bowles-Gandier House are now mostly home to undergraduate arts and science students.  The latter two are mostly reserved for students in the new Vic One Programme.

Famous residents of Burwash include [[Vincent Massey]], [[Lester B. Pearson]], [[Don Harron]], and [[Donald Sutherland]].  The upper houses were gutted and renovated in 1995.  The lower houses have only been partially upgraded.  Before the renovations the entire building was all male, but now every house is co-ed.

Each Upper House consists of three floors.  The lower floor contains a [[common room]] equipped with kitchen facilities, couches and a television.  The upper floors each have their own kitchen and dining area.  All except North House have a very high bathroom ratio, with Gate House being the best with nine washrooms for its twenty-eight residents.  Upper Houses are divided between double rooms and singles, with about sixty percent of the population being in doubles.

The Lower Houses each have four floors, but are much narrower with each level having only four rooms.  Each level also has its own kitchen, but these are much smaller than in the Upper Houses. The Lower Houses do have far larger and better fitted common rooms that are similar to the one's the Upper Houses had before the renovations.  The rooms in the Lower Houses are also considered more luxurious with [[hardwood floor]]s and large sizes. Rooms in the Lower Houses are more expensive, however. Until 2003 the Lower Houses were restricted to upper year students but with the [[double cohort]] of graduates from Ontario schools many of the rooms were transformed into doubles and now hold first years.

To the west the Upper Houses look out on the Vic Quad and the main Victoria College building across it.  West of the Lower Houses is the new Lester B. Pearson Garden of Peace and International Understanding and the [[E.J. Pratt Library]] beyond it.  From the eastern side of the building, the Upper Houses look out at [[Rowell Jackman Hall]] and the Lower Houses see the [[St. Michael's College (U of T)|St. Michael's College]] residence of [[Elmsley]].  The only exception is the view from Gate House's tower that looks down St. Mary's Street.

The dining hall is perhaps the best known part of the building to outsiders.  It is the University of Toronto's largest holding some 250 students and sixteen large tables.  Hanging on the western wall is [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria's]] burial flag, given to the college soon after her death.  Under the flag is the [[High Table|high table]] where the professors and college administration lunch.  Historically, the Upper Houses each had their own table.  Gate sat in the southwest corner, Middle sat in the far northeast, South sat in the table to the west of Middle, while North sat to the west of the southeast corner. The only lower house to have had a designated table was Caven, in the northwest corner beside the Alumni table. (Note that prior to the 1995 renovations, some of these houses, particularly North and Caven, 'traditionally' sat elsewhere)

==Gate House==
[[Image:Gate House.jpg|thumb|Gate House as viewed from the Victoria Quad.]]
'''Gate House''' is one of the four Upper Houses of the Burwash Hall residence. Until 2007, when Victoria administration made it co-ed, Gate House was one of the last remaining all-male residence building in the University of Toronto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Taylor, Bill|date=2007-12-19|title=Party's over at U of T residence|publisher=[[Toronto Star]]''|url=http://www.thestar.com/News/GTA/article/286958|accessdate=2007-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Gate House emblem is the Phoenix, visible in the bottom-right corner of the Victoria College insignia. 

Gate House, with the rest of Upper Burwash, opened in 1913 and has held students every year since then except 1995, when it was renovated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Houghton, Sarah|date=2003-03-12|title=One Hundred Years of Architecture|publisher=The Strand''|url=http://www.vicu.utoronto.ca/about/history/One_Hundred_Years_of_Architecture.htm|accessdate=2007-06-05 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070525051149/http://www.vicu.utoronto.ca/about/history/One_Hundred_Years_of_Architecture.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an all-male residence from 1913 to 2007 it held a number of unique traditions. For 20 years Gate House hosted an annual party called Novemberfest in the Burwash dining hall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Tsang, Sharon|date=2002-12-04|title='Student aspect' of Vic liquor license suspended|publisher=The Strand''|url=http://media.www.thestrand.ca/media/storage/paper404/news/2002/12/04/News/student.Aspect.Of.Vic.Liquor.License.Suspended-337730.shtml|accessdate=2007-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Victoria Dean of Students cancelled Novemberfest in 2003, when police discovered widespread underage drinking and over 800 people in the dining hall, in violation of the fire code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Salonen, Rachel|date=2002-01-22|title='Student pub taken out of students' hands|publisher=The Strand''|url=http://media.www.thestrand.ca/media/storage/paper404/news/2003/01/22/News/Student.Pub.Taken.Out.Of.Students.Hands-350656.shtml|accessdate=2007-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another Gate House tradition that no longer occurs is the &quot;stirring the chicken,&quot; a dinner and keg party where house members cook chicken fajitas for hundreds of guests. Until 2007, Gate House held secretive first-year initiation ceremonies called Traditionals, which involved writing slogans on campus buildings in chalk, singing songs to the all-women's residence (who would then sing back to them), and leading first-years around the house blindfolded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Bao, Jane|date=2007-01-07|title='Boy's club dismembered|publisher=The Varsity''|url=http://www.thevarsity.ca/article/1417|accessdate=2007-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since Novemberfest, Gate House continued to have conflict with the Administration. In 2004 the Dean evicted three Gate House residents for allegedly &quot;hog-tying&quot; a first-year student.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Doukas, Alex|date=2004-03-17|title='Three students booted from res|publisher=The Strand''|url=http://media.www.thestrand.ca/media/storage/paper404/news/2004/03/17/News/Three.Students.Booted.From.Res-637000.shtml|accessdate=2007-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 President Paul W. Gooch wrote that Gate House undertook an &quot;escalating series of actions&quot; that were &quot;defiant&quot; and &quot;disparaging of women&quot;, in response to Gate members constructing a 2.5-metre snow penis and placing a cooked pig's head in an Annesley bathroom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sibonney, Claire|date=2007-12-19|title='University of Toronto's Animal House laid to rest|publisher=[[Reuters]]''|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/lifestyleMolt/idUSN1960484520071219?pageNumber=1&amp;virtualBrandChannel=0}}&lt;/ref&gt; As punishment, during the fall exam period Gooch evicted two residents and relocated the remainder of Gate House to other places in the residence system, banned all current Gate House students from entering the building in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Taylor, Bill|date=2007-12-19|title='Party's over at U of T residence|publisher=[[Toronto Star]]''|url=http://www.thestar.com/News/GTA/article/286958|accessdate=2007-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since this decision Gate House has become a co-ed residence identical to the other Upper Burwash houses. Notable residents of Gate House include  [[Lester B. Pearson]], former Prime Minister of Canada, and [[Simon Pulsifer]], who Time Magazine nicknamed &quot;The Duke of Data&quot; for his contributions to Wikipedia.&lt;ref&gt;

During its 93 years as a men's residence, Gate House developed a distinct character and reputation. These antics included pranks, toga parties, streaking, caroling to other residences, hazing rituals, &quot;beer bashes&quot; and &quot;incessant pounding&quot; on the Gate House table in the dining hall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Richards, Jason|date=2004-09-18|title='Gate House Traditionals Exposed|publisher=The Strand''|url=http://media.www.thestrand.ca/media/storage/paper404/news/2002/09/18/Stranded/Gate-House.Traditionals.Exposed-290475.shtml|accessdate=2007-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Taylor, Bill|date=2007-12-19|title='Party's over at U of T residence|publisher=[[Toronto Star]]''|url=http://www.thestar.com/News/GTA/article/286958|accessdate=2007-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Gooch wrote that these traditions gave Gate House an &quot;ethos&quot; that contradicted his vision of residence life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Taylor, Bill|date=2007-12-19|title='Party's over at U of T residence|publisher=[[Toronto Star]]''|url=http://www.thestar.com/News/GTA/article/286958|accessdate=2007-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The all-male Gate House was known as a social centre and spirited, tight-knit community. According to Grayson Lee, who created the snow penis sculpture in 2007, most of its residents were &quot;heartbroken&quot; to leave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sibonney, Claire|date=2007-12-19|title='University of Toronto's Animal House laid to rest|publisher=[[Reuters]]''|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/lifestyleMolt/idUSN1960484520071219?pageNumber=1&amp;virtualBrandChannel=0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former Gate House President Dave Ruhl commented that &quot;the Gate House camaraderie is unique&quot; and that living there was &quot;one of the most important parts of the university experience&quot; for many.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Taylor, Bill|date=2007-12-19|title='Party's over at U of T residence|publisher=[[Toronto Star]]''|url=http://www.thestar.com/News/GTA/article/286958|accessdate=2007-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Reuters news agency nicknamed Gate House &quot;U of T's Animal House&quot; because Donald Sutherland's memories of its parties are said to have influenced the script of the 1978 movie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sibonney, Claire|date=2007-12-19|title='University of Toronto's Animal House laid to rest|publisher=[[Reuters]]''|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/lifestyleMolt/idUSN1960484520071219?pageNumber=1&amp;virtualBrandChannel=0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Toronto Star described Gooch's decision to put an end to its traditions, activities and distinguishing characteristics as &quot;neutering Animal House.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Taylor, Bill|date=2007-12-19|title='Party's over at U of T residence.|publisher=[[Toronto Star]]''|url=http://www.thestar.com/News/GTA/article/286958|accessdate=2007-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gate House has three floors which house 28 students, as well as a don and the Victoria College Residence Life Co-ordinator. Above the gate there is a tower that rises three stories higher and has a turret-style roof. The tower is locked during the school year and entering it is a Level 4 offense under the Victoria residence agreement for which the punishment is eviction from residence. 

The '''first floor''' has one double room and one bathroom available to students. About half of the floor is taken up by the apartment of the Residence Life Coordinator. Lastly, on the first floor there is a house common room with a kitchen and two couches.[http://www.vicu.utoronto.ca/Assets/Victoria/assets/Upper_Burwash_1st_Floor_10571_579514.jpg?method=1]  The '''second floor''' has three double rooms and seven single rooms. It has three single washrooms and one larger communal one, as well as its own kitchen. This floor is home to the residence don, who has a larger room with a private washroom. The '''third floor''' is identical to the second except that in place of the don's room there are two single rooms.[http://www.vicu.utoronto.ca/Assets/Victoria/assets/Upper_Burwash_2nd_and_3rd_Floor_10570_797531.jpg?method=1]

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Benzos}}
A '''benzodiazepine''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˌ|b|ɛ|n|z|ɵ|d|aɪ|ˈ|æ|z|ɨ|p|iː|n}}; sometimes colloquially &quot;'''benzo'''&quot;; often abbreviated &quot;'''BZD'''&quot;) is a [[psychoactive drug]] whose core chemical structure is the fusion of a [[benzene]] ring and a [[diazepine]] ring. The first benzodiazepine, [[chlordiazepoxide]] (Librium), was [[Serendipity|discovered accidentally]] by [[Leo Sternbach]] in 1955, and made available in 1960 by [[Hoffmann–La Roche]], which has also marketed [[diazepam]] (Valium) since 1963.&lt;ref name=isbn0-19-517668-5/&gt;

Benzodiazepines enhance the effect of the [[neurotransmitter]] [[gamma-Aminobutyric acid|gamma-aminobutyric acid]] (GABA), which results in [[sedative]], [[hypnotic]] ([[Sleep induction|sleep-inducing]]), [[anxiolytic]] (anti-anxiety), [[anticonvulsant]], [[muscle relaxant]] and [[anterograde amnesia|amnesic]] action.&lt;ref name=ip2002/&gt; These properties make benzodiazepines useful in treating [[anxiety]], [[insomnia]], [[Psychomotor agitation|agitation]], [[seizure]]s, [[Spasm|muscle spasms]], [[alcohol withdrawal]] and as a [[premedication]] for medical or dental procedures.&lt;ref name=pmid18175099/&gt; Benzodiazepines are categorized as either short-, intermediate- or long-acting. Short- and intermediate-acting benzodiazepines are preferred for the treatment of insomnia; longer-acting benzodiazepines are recommended for the treatment of anxiety.&lt;ref name=sddat/&gt;

In general, benzodiazepines are safe and effective in the short term, although cognitive impairments and [[paradoxical effect]]s such as aggression or behavioral [[disinhibition]] occasionally occur.&lt;ref name=pmid18922233/&gt; Long-term use is controversial due to concerns about adverse psychological and physical effects, increased questioning of effectiveness and because benzodiazepines are prone to cause [[drug tolerance|tolerance]], [[physical dependence]], and, upon cessation of use, a [[benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome|withdrawal syndrome]].&lt;ref name=pmid18671662/&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid19062773/&gt; Due to adverse effects associated with the long-term use of benzodiazepines, withdrawal from benzodiazepines, in general, leads to improved physical and mental health.&lt;ref name=tdamobd2004 /&gt;&lt;ref name=asapdacg /&gt; The elderly are at an increased risk of suffering from both short- and long-term [[adverse drug reaction|adverse effects]].&lt;ref name=tdamobd2004/&gt;&lt;ref name=ohop/&gt;

There is controversy concerning the safety of benzodiazepines in pregnancy. While they are not major [[teratogens]], uncertainty remains as to whether they cause [[cleft palate]] in a small number of babies and whether neurobehavioural effects occur as a result of prenatal exposure;&lt;ref name=ACOG /&gt; they are known to cause [[Neonatal withdrawal|withdrawal symptoms in the newborn]]. Benzodiazepines can be taken in [[overdose]]s and can cause dangerous [[coma|deep unconsciousness]]. However, they are much less toxic than their predecessors, the [[barbiturate]]s, and death rarely results when a benzodiazepine is the only drug taken. When combined with other [[central nervous system depressants]] such as [[Alcoholic beverage|alcohol]] and [[opiates]], the potential for toxicity increases.&lt;ref name=pmid9780123/&gt; Benzodiazepines are commonly misused and taken in combination with other [[Drug abuse|drugs of abuse]].&lt;ref name=Charlson_2009/&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid10707430/&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid10622686/&gt;

Due to their effectiveness, tolerability, and rapid onset of anxiolytic action, benzodiazepines are frequently used for the treatment of anxiety associated with panic disorder.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15762816&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Stevens JC, Pollack MH |title=Benzodiazepines in clinical practice: consideration of their long-term use and alternative agents |journal=Journal of Clinical Psychiatry |volume=66 |issue=Suppl 2 |pages=21–27 |year=2005 |pmid=15762816|quote=The frequent use of benzodiazepines for the treatment of anxiety is likely a reflection of their effectiveness, rapid onset of anxiolytic effect, and tolerability.}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is disagreement among expert bodies regarding the long-term use of benzodiazepines for panic disorder. The views range from those that hold that benzodiazepines are not effective long-term &lt;ref name=cgftmamoa2004/&gt; and that they should be reserved for treatment-resistant cases&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bandelow B, Zohar J, Hollander E, Kasper S, Möller HJ |title=World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry (WFSBP) guidelines for the pharmacological treatment of anxiety, obsessive-compulsive and posttraumatic stress disorders |journal=World J. Biol. Psychiatry |volume=3 |issue=4 |pages=171–99 |year=2002 |month=October |pmid=12516310 |doi= 10.3109/15622970209150621|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to that they are as effective in the long term as [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors]].&lt;ref name=APA/&gt;

The [[American Psychiatric Association]] (APA) guidelines&lt;ref name=&quot;APA&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.psychiatryonline.com/pracGuide/loadGuidelinePdf.aspx?file=PanicDisorder_2e_PracticeGuideline |format=PDF |title= APA Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients With Panic Disorder, Second Edition |author=Work Group on Panic Disorder |date=January 2009 |accessdate=July 12, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; note that, in general, benzodiazepines are well tolerated, and their use for the initial treatment for panic disorder is strongly supported by numerous controlled trials. APA states that there is insufficient evidence to recommend any of the established panic disorder treatments over another. The choice of treatment between benzodiazepines, [[SSRI]]s, [[serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors]], [[tricyclic antidepressant]]s, and psychotherapy should be based on the patient's history, preference, and other individual characteristics. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are likely to be the best choice of pharmacotherapy for many patients with panic disorder, but benzodiazepines are also often used, and some studies suggest that these medications are still used with greater frequency than the SSRIs. One advantage of benzodiazepines is that they alleviate the anxiety symptoms much faster than antidepressants, and therefore may be preferred in patients for whom rapid symptom control is critical. However, this advantage is offset by the possibility of developing [[benzodiazepine dependence]]. APA does not recommend benzodiazepines for persons with depressive symptoms or a recent history of [[substance abuse]]. The APA guidelines state that, in general, pharmacotherapy of panic disorder should be continued for at least a year, and that clinical experience support continuing benzodiazepine treatment to prevent recurrence. Although major concerns about benzodiazepine tolerance and withdrawal have been raised, there is no evidence for significant dose escalation in patients using benzodiazepines long-term. For many such patients stable doses of benzodiazepines retain their efficacy over several years.&lt;ref name=APA/&gt;

Guidelines issued by the UK-based [[National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence]] (NICE), carried out a systematic review using different methodology and came to a different conclusion. They questioned the accuracy of studies that were not placebo-controlled. And, based on the findings of [[placebo-controlled studies]], they do not recommend use of benzodiazepines beyond two to four weeks, as tolerance and [[physical dependence]] develop rapidly, with withdrawal symptoms including [[rebound anxiety]] occurring after six weeks or more of use.&lt;ref name=cgftmamoa2004&gt;{{cite web |author=McIntosh A, Cohen A, Turnbull N ''et al.'' |title=Clinical guidelines and evidence review for panic disorder and generalised anxiety disorder |url=http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/pdf/cg022fullguideline.pdf |publisher=National Collaborating Centre for Primary Care |year=2004 |accessdate=2009-06-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Barbui C, Cipriani A |title=Proposal for the inclusion in the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines of a selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitor for Generalised Anxiety Disorder |url=http://who.int/selection_medicines/committees/expert/17/application/Section24_GAD.pdf |publisher=WHO Collaborating Centre for Research and Training in Mental Health |year=2009 |accessdate=2009-06-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, benzodiazepines continue to be prescribed for the long-term treatment of [[anxiety disorders]], although specific [[antidepressants]] and psychological therapies are recommended as the [[first-line treatment]] options with the [[anticonvulsant]] drug [[pregabalin]] indicated as a second- or third-line treatment and suitable for long-term use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Cloos JM, Ferreira V |title=Current use of benzodiazepines in anxiety disorders |journal=Current Opinion in Psychiatry |volume=22 |issue=1 |pages=90–95 |year=2009 |pmid=19122540 |doi=10.1097/YCO.0b013e32831a473d }}&lt;/ref&gt; NICE stated that long-term use of benzodiazepines for panic disorder with or without [[agoraphobia]] is an unlicensed indication, does not have long-term efficacy, and is, therefore, not recommended by clinical guidelines. Psychological therapies such as [[cognitive behavioural therapy]] are recommended as a first-line therapy for panic disorder; benzodiazepine use has been found to interfere with therapeutic gains from these therapies.&lt;ref name=cgftmamoa2004 /&gt;

Benzodiazepines are usually administered orally; however, very occasionally lorazepam or diazepam may be given intravenously for the treatment of [[panic attacks]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BNF_2009&quot;/&gt;

===Generalized anxiety disorder===
Benzodiazepines have robust efficacy in the short-term management of [[generalized anxiety disorder]] (GAD), but were not shown to be effective in producing long-term improvement overall.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17881433&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Martin JL, Sainz-Pardo M, Furukawa TA, Martín-Sánchez E, Seoane T, Galán C |title=Benzodiazepines in generalized anxiety disorder: heterogeneity of outcomes based on a systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials |journal=J.

However, they should not usually be given for longer than 2–4 weeks. The only medications NICE recommends for the longer term management of GAD are antidepressants.&lt;ref name=NICECG022&gt;{{cite web |author=|title=Clinical Guideline 22 (amended).

Likewise, Canadian Psychiatric Association (CPA) recommends benzodiazepines [[alprazolam]], [[bromazepam]], [[lorazepam]], and [[diazepam]] only as a second-line choice, if the treatment with two different antidepressants was unsuccessful. Although they are second-line agents, benzodiazepines can be used for a limited time to relieve severe anxiety and agitation. CPA guidelines note that after 4–6 weeks the effect of benzodiazepines may decrease to the level of placebo, and that benzodiazepines are less effective than antidepressants in alleviating [[rumination (psychology)|ruminative worry]], the core symptom of GAD. However, in some cases, a prolonged treatment with benzodiazepines as the add-on to an antidepressant may be justified.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16933543&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Canadian Psychiatric Association |title=Clinical practice guidelines.

===Insomnia===
[[File:Normison 10 mg.jpg|thumb|230px|Normison ([[temazepam]]) 10 mg tablets ([[Australia|AU]])]]

Benzodiazepines can be useful for short-term treatment of insomnia. Their use beyond 2 to 4 weeks is not recommended due to the risk of dependence. It is preferred that benzodiazepines be taken intermittently and at the lowest effective dose. They improve sleep-related problems by shortening the time spent in bed before falling asleep, prolonging the sleep time, and, in general, reducing wakefulness.&lt;ref name=nice-hypnotics&gt;{{cite web |author=|title=Technology Appraisal Guidance 77.

Other drawbacks of hypnotics, including benzodiazepines, are possible tolerance to their effects, [[rebound insomnia]], and reduced slow-wave sleep and a withdrawal period typified by [[rebound insomnia]] and a prolonged period of anxiety and agitation.&lt;ref name=&quot;handbook_of_integrative&quot;&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = D. Maiuro PhD | first1 = Roland | title = Handbook of Integrative Clinical Psychology, Psychiatry, and Behavioral Medicine: Perspectives, Practices, and Research | date = 13 December 2009 | publisher = Springer Publishing Company | url = http://books.google.com/?id=4Tkdm1vRFbUC | isbn = 0-8261-1094-0 | pages = 128–30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ahrq&quot;/&gt; Among the benzodiazepines approved in the US for the treatment of insomnia, the fast-acting ones with short half-lives such as [[estazolam]], [[triazolam]], and [[temazepam]] are recommended.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17853625&quot;/&gt; Longer-acting benzodiazepines such as [[nitrazepam]] and [[diazepam]] have residual effects that may persist into the next day and are, in general, not recommended.&lt;ref name=nice-hypnotics/&gt;

It is not clear as to whether the new [[nonbenzodiazepine]] hypnotics (Z-drugs) are better than the short-acting benzodiazepines. The efficacy of these two groups of medications is similar.&lt;ref name=nice-hypnotics/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ahrq&quot;/&gt; According to the US [[Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality]], indirect comparison indicates that side-effects from benzodiazepines may be about twice as frequent as from nonbenzodiazepines.&lt;ref name=&quot;ahrq&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author=Buscemi N, Vandermeer B, Friesen C, Bialy L, Tubman M, Ospina M, Klassen TP, Witmans M |title=Manifestations and Management of Chronic Insomnia in Adults.

NICE review pointed out that short-acting Z-drugs were inappropriately compared in clinical trials with long-acting benzodiazepines. There have been no trials comparing short-acting Z-drugs with appropriate doses of short-acting benzodiazepines. Based on this, NICE recommended choosing the hypnotic based on cost and the patient's preference.&lt;ref name=nice-hypnotics/&gt;

It has been argued that long-term use of [[hypnotics]] and overprescribing of these drugs represents an unjustifiable risk, especially to the elderly, and is harmful for the [[public health]] in general.&lt;ref name=&quot;therbull&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title=What's wrong with prescribing hypnotics? |journal=Drug Ther Bull |volume=42 |issue=12 |pages=89–93 |year=2004 |pmid=15587763 |doi=10.1136/dtb.2004.421289 | laysummary = http://www.nelm.nhs.uk/en/NeLM-Area/Evidence/Drug-Class-Focused-Reviews/Whats-wrong-with-prescribing-hypnotics/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Seizures===
Prolonged convulsive [[epileptic seizure]]s are a [[medical emergency]] that can usually be dealt with effectively by administering fast-acting benzodiazepines, which are potent [[anticonvulsants]]. In a hospital environment, [[intravenous]] [[lorazepam]], and [[diazepam]] are first-line choices, diazepam due to its faster onset and lorazepam for its longer duration of action. In the community, intravenous administration is not practical and so [[rectal]] diazepam or (more recently) [[buccal mucosa|buccal]] [[midazolam]] are used, with a preference for midazolam as its administration is easier and more socially acceptable.&lt;ref name=SIGN70&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sign.ac.uk/pdf/sign70.pdf |title=Diagnosis and management of epilepsy in adults |accessdate=2009-06-05 |author=Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network |year=2005 |pages=17–9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NICECG020&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/pdf/CG020fullguideline.pdf |title=Clinical Guidelines and Evidence Review for the Epilepsies: diagnosis and management in adults and children in primary and secondary care |accessdate=2009-06-02 |author=Stokes T, Shaw EJ, Juarez-Garcia A, Camosso-Stefinovic J, Baker R |year=2004 | month = October |publisher=Royal College of General Practitioners |pages=61, 64–65 | location = London }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When benzodiazepines were first introduced, they were enthusiastically adopted for treating all forms of [[epilepsy]]. However, drowsiness and [[drug tolerance|tolerance]] become problems with continued use and none are now considered [[first-line treatment|first-line]] choices for long-term epilepsy therapy.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid19298435&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Shorvon SD |title=Drug treatment of epilepsy in the century of the ILAE: the second 50 years, 1959-2009 |journal=Epilepsia |volume=50 |issue=Suppl 3 |pages=93–130 |year=2009 | month = March |pmid=19298435 |doi=10.1111/j.1528-1167.2009.02042.x |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1528-1167.2009.02042.x/pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Clobazam is widely used by specialist epilepsy clinics worldwide (but it is not available in the US) and clonazepam is popular in France.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid19298435&quot;/&gt; In the UK, both clobazam and clonazepam are second-line choices for treating many forms of epilepsy.&lt;ref name=NICECG020b&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/pdf/CG020fullguideline_appendixB.pdf |title=Clinical Guidelines and Evidence Review for the Epilepsies: diagnosis and management in adults and children in primary and secondary care (Appendix B) |accessdate=2009-06-02 |author=Stokes T, Shaw EJ, Juarez-Garcia A, Camosso-Stefinovic J, Baker R |year=2004 | month = October |publisher=Royal College of General Practitioners |page=432 | location = London }}&lt;/ref&gt; Clobazam also has a useful role for very short-term seizure [[prophylaxis]] and in [[catamenial epilepsy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid19298435&quot;/&gt; Discontinuation after long term use in epilepsy requires additional caution because of the risks of rebound seizures. Therefore, the dose is slowly tapered over a period of up to six months or longer.&lt;ref name=NICECG020/&gt;

===Alcohol withdrawal===
[[Chlordiazepoxide]] is the most commonly used benzodiazepine for [[alcohol detoxification]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ashworth M, Gerada C |title=ABC of mental health. Addiction and dependence--II: Alcohol |journal=[[BMJ]] |volume=315 |issue=7104 |pages=358–60 |year=1997 |pmid=9270461 |pmc=2127236 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but [[diazepam]] may be used as an alternative. Both are used in the detoxification of individuals who are motivated to stop drinking, and are prescribed for a short period of time to reduce the risks of developing tolerance and dependence to the benzodiazepine medication itself.&lt;ref name=&quot;BNF_2009&quot;/&gt;{{rp|275}} The benzodiazepines with a longer half-life make detoxification more tolerable, and dangerous alcohol withdrawal effects are less likely to occur. On the other hand, short-acting benzodiazepines may lead to [[breakthrough seizure]]s, and are, therefore, not recommended for detoxification in an outpatient setting. [[Oxazepam]] and [[lorazepam]] are often used in patients at risk of drug accumulation, in particular, the elderly and those with [[cirrhosis]], because they are metabolized differently from other benzodiazepines, through [[Glucuronidation|conjugation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kraemer KL, Conigliaro J, Saitz R |title=Managing alcohol withdrawal in the elderly |journal=Drugs Aging |volume=14 |issue=6 |pages=409–25 |year=1999 |pmid=10408740 |doi=10.2165/00002512-199914060-00002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Prater CD, Miller KE, Zylstra RG |title=Outpatient detoxification of the addicted or alcoholic patient |journal=[[American Family Physician]] |volume=60 |issue=4 |pages=1175–83 |year=1999 | month = September |pmid=10507746 |url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/990915ap/1175.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anxiety===
Benzodiazepines are sometimes used in the treatment of acute anxiety, as they bring about rapid and marked or moderate relief of symptoms in most individuals;&lt;ref name=cgftmamoa2004/&gt; however, they are not recommended beyond 2–4 weeks of use due to risks of tolerance and dependence and a lack of long-term effectiveness. Compared to other pharmacological treatments, benzodiazepines are twice as likely to lead to a relapse of the underlying condition upon discontinuation. Psychological therapies and other pharmacological therapies are recommended for the long-term treatment of generalised anxiety disorder. Antidepressants have higher remission rates and are, in general, safe and effective in the short and long term.&lt;ref name=cgftmamoa2004/&gt;

===Other indications===
Benzodiazepines are often prescribed for a wide range of conditions:
* They can be very useful in intensive care to sedate patients receiving [[mechanical ventilation]] or those in extreme distress. Caution is exercised in this situation due to the occasional occurrence of [[respiratory depression]], and it is recommended that [[benzodiazepine overdose]] treatment facilities should be available.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Devlin | first1 = JW. | last2 = Roberts | first2 = RJ. | title = Pharmacology of commonly used analgesics and sedatives in the ICU: benzodiazepines, propofol, and opioids | journal = Crit Care Clin | volume = 25 | issue = 3 | pages = 431–49, vii | month = July | year = 2009 | doi = 10.1016/j.ccc.2009.03.003 | pmid = 19576523 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Benzodiazepines are effective as medication given a couple of hours before surgery to relieve anxiety. They also produce [[amnesia]], which can be useful, as patients will not be able to remember any unpleasantness from the procedure.&lt;ref name=&quot;Broscheit-2008&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Broscheit | first1 = J. | last2 = Kranke | first2 = P. | title = [The preoperative medication: background and specific indications for the selection of the drugs] | journal = Anasthesiol Intensivmed Notfallmed Schmerzther | volume = 43 | issue = 2 | pages = 134–43 | month = February | year = 2008 | doi = 10.1055/s-2008-1060547 | pmid = 18293248 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are also used in patients with [[dental phobia]] as well as some ophthalmic procedures like refractive surgery; although such use is controversial and only recommended for those who are very anxious.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Berthold | first1 = C. | title = Enteral sedation: safety, efficacy, and controversy | journal = Compend Contin Educ Dent | volume = 28 | issue = 5 | pages = 264–71; quiz 272, 282 | month = May | year = 2007 | pmid = 17607891 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Midazolam is the most commonly prescribed for this use because of its strong sedative actions and fast recovery time, as well as its water solubility, which reduces pain upon injection. Diazepam and lorazepam are sometimes used. Lorazepam has particularly marked amnesic properties that may make it more effective when amnesia is the desired effect.&lt;ref name=&quot;BNF_2009&quot;/&gt;{{rp|693}}
* Benzodiazepines are well known for their strong muscle-relaxing properties and can be useful in the treatment of muscle spasms,&lt;ref name=&quot;BNF_2009&quot;/&gt;{{rp|577–578}} although tolerance often develops to their muscle relaxant effects.&lt;ref name=tdamobd2004 /&gt; [[Baclofen]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mañon-Espaillat R, Mandel S |title=Diagnostic algorithms for neuromuscular diseases |journal=Clin Podiatr Med Surg |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=67–79 |year=1999 |pmid=9929772 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[tizanidine]] are sometimes used as an alternative to benzodiazepines.

===Cognitive effects===
The short-term use of benzodiazepines adversely affects multiple areas of cognition, the most notable one being that it interferes with the formation and consolidation of memories of new material and may induce complete anterograde amnesia.&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn0-683-30128-4&quot;/&gt; However, researchers hold contrary opinions regarding the effects of long-term administration. One view is that many of the short-term effects continue into the long-term and may even worsen, and are not resolved after quitting benzodiazepines. Another view maintains that cognitive deficits in chronic benzodiazepine users occur only for a short period after the dose, or that the anxiety disorders is the cause of these deficits. While the definitive studies are lacking, the former view recently received support from a meta-analysis of 13 small studies.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid14731058&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Barker MJ, Greenwood KM, Jackson M, Crowe SF |title=Cognitive effects of long-term benzodiazepine use: a meta-analysis |journal=CNS Drugs |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=37–48 |year=2004 |pmid=14731058 |doi=10.2165/00023210-200418010-00004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15762814&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author= Stewart SA |title= The effects of benzodiazepines on cognition |journal= J Clin Psychiatry |volume=66 |issue= Suppl 2 |pages=9–13 |year=2005 |pmid=15762814 |url=http://psychiatrist.com/supplenet/v66s02/v66s0202.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; This meta-analysis found that long-term use of benzodiazepines was associated with moderate to large adverse effects on all areas of cognition, with [[visuospatial]] memory being the most commonly detected impairment. Some of the other impairments reported were decreased IQ, visiomotor coordination, information processing, verbal learning and concentration. The authors of the meta-analysis&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid14731058&quot;/&gt; and a later reviewer&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15762814&quot;/&gt; noted that the applicability of this meta-analysis is limited because the subjects were taken mostly from withdrawal clinics; the coexisting drug, alcohol use, and psychiatric disorders were not defined; and several of the included studies conducted the cognitive measurements during the withdrawal period.

===Long-term effects===
The FDA has not approved benzodiazepines for long-term use. The [[long-term adverse effects of benzodiazepines]] include a general deterioration in physical and [[mental health]] and tend to increase with time. Not everyone, however, experiences problems with long-term use. The adverse effects can include [[cognitive impairment]], as well as affective and behavioural problems. Feelings of turmoil, difficulty in thinking constructively, loss of sex-drive, agoraphobia and social phobia, increasing anxiety and depression, loss of interest in leisure pursuits and interests, and an inability to experience or express feelings can also occur.&lt;ref name=asapdacg&gt;{{cite book |editor=Haddad P, Dursun S, Deakin B (eds.) |title=Adverse Syndromes and Psychiatric Drugs: A Clinical Guide |year=2004 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0198527480 |pages=239–60 |author=Ashton H |chapter=Benzodiazepine dependence }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=Palmer S, Dainow S, Milner P (eds.) |title=Counselling: The BACP Counselling Reader |volume=1 |year=1996 |publisher=Sage |isbn=978-0803974777 |pages=211–4 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=wnIBEQKQi7IC |author=Hammersley D, Beeley L |chapter=The effects of medication on counselling }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally an altered perception of self, environment and relationships may occur.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15762814&quot; /&gt;

====Tolerance, dependence and withdrawal====
The main problem of the chronic use of benzodiazepines is the development of [[drug tolerance|tolerance]] and [[physical dependence|dependence]]. Tolerance manifests itself as diminished pharmacological effect and develops relatively quickly to the sedative, hypnotic, anticonvulsant, and muscle relaxant actions of benzodiazepines. Tolerance to anti-anxiety effects develops more slowly with little evidence of continued effectiveness beyond four to six months of continued use.&lt;ref name=tdamobd2004 /&gt; In general, tolerance to the amnesic effects does not occur.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid10779253&quot; /&gt; However, controversy exists as to tolerance to the anxiolytic effects with some evidence that benzodiazepines retain efficacy&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16528135&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Nardi AE, Perna G |title=Clonazepam in the treatment of psychiatric disorders: an update |journal=Int Clin Psychopharmacol |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=131–42 |year=2006 |month=May |pmid=16528135 |doi=10.1097/01.yic.0000194379.65460.a6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and opposing evidence from a systematic review of the literature that tolerance frequently occurs&lt;ref name=Perugi /&gt;&lt;ref name=cgftmamoa2004 /&gt; and some evidence that anxiety may worsen with long-term use.&lt;ref name=tdamobd2004 /&gt; The question of tolerance to the amnesic effects of benzodiazepines is, likewise, unclear.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15762818&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Otto MW, Bruce SE, Deckersbach T |title=Benzodiazepine use, cognitive impairment, and cognitive-behavioral therapy for anxiety disorders: issues in the treatment of a patient in need |journal=J Clin Psychiatry |volume=66 |issue=Suppl 2 |pages=34–8 |year=2005 |pmid=15762818 |url=http://psychiatrist.com/supplenet/v66s02/v66s0206.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some evidence suggests that partial tolerance does develop, and &quot;the memory impairment is limited to a narrow window within 90 minutes after each dose&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15078112&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Chouinard G |title=Issues in the clinical use of benzodiazepines: potency, withdrawal, and rebound |journal=J Clin Psychiatry |volume=65 |issue=Suppl 5 |pages=7–12 |year=2004 |pmid=15078112 |url=http://psychiatrist.com/supplenet/v65s05/v65s0502.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Discontinuation of benzodiazepines or abrupt reduction of the dose, even after a relatively short course of treatment (three to four weeks), may result in two groups of symptoms — [[Rebound effect|rebound]] and [[benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome|withdrawal]]. Rebound symptoms are the return of the symptoms for which the patient was treated but worse than before. Withdrawal symptoms are the new symptoms that occur when the benzodiazepine is stopped. They are the main sign of [[physical dependence]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15078112&quot;/&gt;

====Withdrawal symptoms and management====
[[File:Chlordiazepoxidetabletsgeneric.JPG|thumb|alt=White bottle on blue pad atop a desk. The bottle cap is off, and is upside down on the pad in front of the bottle. In the cap are a dozen black-and-yellow capsules.|[[Chlordiazepoxide]] 5&amp;nbsp;mg capsules, which are sometimes used as an alternative to [[diazepam]] for [[benzodiazepine withdrawal]]. Like diazepam it has a long [[elimination half-life]] and long-acting [[active metabolites]]. ([[United States|US]])]]

The most frequent symptoms of withdrawal from benzodiazepines are insomnia, gastric problems, [[tremor]]s, agitation, fearfulness, and [[Spasm|muscle spasms]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15078112&quot;/&gt; The less frequent effects are irritability, sweating, [[depersonalization]], [[derealization]], hypersensitivity to stimuli, [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[suicidal]] behavior, [[psychosis]], [[seizures]], and [[delirium tremens]].&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn0-19-856667-0&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Harrison PC, Gelder MG, Cowen P |title=Shorter Oxford Textbook of Psychiatry |edition=5th |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2006 |pages=461–2 |chapter=The misuse of alcohol and drugs |isbn=0-19-856667-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Severe symptoms usually occur as a result of abrupt or over-rapid withdrawal. Abrupt withdrawal can be dangerous, therefore a gradual reduction regime is recommended.&lt;ref name=pmid19062773&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lader M, Tylee A, Donoghue J |title=Withdrawing benzodiazepines in primary care |journal=CNS Drugs |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=19–34 |year=2009 |pmid=19062773 |doi=10.2165/0023210-200923010-00002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Symptoms may also occur during a gradual dosage reduction, but are typically less severe and may persist as part of a protracted [[Benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome|withdrawal syndrome]] for months after cessation of benzodiazepines.&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn0-19-852518-4&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Longmore M, Scally P, Collier J |edition=6th |title=Oxford Handbook of Clinical Specialties |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2003 |page=366&lt;!--Please replace this with &quot;pages=&quot; and the pages of the chapter.--&gt; |chapter=Chapter 4&lt;!--Please replace this with the chapter title.--&gt; |isbn=0-19-852518-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 10% of patients will experience a notable protracted withdrawal syndrome, which can persist for many months or in some cases a year or longer.

Benzodiazepines have a reputation with patients and doctors for causing a severe and traumatic withdrawal; however, this is in large part due to the withdrawal process's being poorly managed. Over-rapid withdrawal from benzodiazepines increases the severity of the withdrawal syndrome and increases the failure rate. A slow and gradual [[withdrawal]] customised to the individual and, if indicated, psychological support is the most effective way of managing the withdrawal. Opinion as to the time needed to complete withdrawal ranges from four weeks to several years. A goal of less than six months has been suggested,&lt;ref name=pmid19062773 /&gt; but due to factors such as dosage and type of benzodiazepine, reasons for prescription, lifestyle, personality, [[environmental stresses]], and amount of available support, a year or more may be needed to withdraw.&lt;ref name=tdamobd2004 /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BNF_2009&quot;/&gt;{{rp|183–184}} Withdrawal is best managed by transferring the physically dependent patient to an equivalent dose of diazepam because it has the longest half-life of all of the benzodiazepines, is metabolised into long-acting active metabolites and is available in low-potency tablets, which can be quartered for smaller doses.&lt;ref name=&quot;manual&quot; /&gt; A further benefit is that it is available in liquid form, which allows for even smaller reductions.&lt;ref name=pmid19062773/&gt; [[Chlordiazepoxide]], which also has a long half-life and long-acting [[active metabolites]], can be used as an alternative.&lt;ref name=&quot;manual&quot;&gt;{{cite book |url=http://benzo.org.uk/manual/ |title=Benzodiazepines: how they work &amp; how to withdraw (aka The Ashton Manual) |author=Ashton CH |year=2002 |accessdate=2009-05-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Lal R, Gupta S, Rao R, Kattimani S |title=Substance Use Disorder |url=http://www.whoindia.org/en/Section20/Section22_1674.htm |accessdate=2009-06-06 |year=2007 |publisher=[[World Health Organization]] (WHO) |page=82 |chapter=Emergency management of substance overdose and withdrawal |chapterurl=http://www.whoindia.org/LinkFiles/Mental_Health_&amp;_substance_Abuse_Emergency_management_of_Substance_Overdose_and_Withdrawal-Manual_For_Nursing_Personnel.pdf |quote=Generally, a longer-acting benzodiazepine such as chlordiazepoxide or diazepam is used and the initial dose titrated downward }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nonbenzodiazepine]]s are contraindicated during benzodiazepine withdrawal as they are [[cross tolerant]] with benzodiazepines and can induce dependence.&lt;ref name=tdamobd2004 /&gt; Alcohol is also cross tolerant with benzodiazepines and more toxic and thus caution is needed to avoid replacing one dependence with another.

Because of their muscle relaxant action, benzodiazepines may cause [[hypoventilation|respiratory depression]] in susceptible individuals.

===Pregnancy===
{{See also|Long term effects of benzodiazepines#Neonatal effects|l1=Effects of benzodiazepines on newborns}}

In the United States, the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|Food and Drug Administration]] has categorized benzodiazepines into either [[Pregnancy category|category D or X]] meaning potential for harm in the unborn has been demonstrated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Roach SS, Ford SM |title=Introductory Clinical Pharmacology |edition=8th |year=2006 |publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins |isbn=978-0-7817-7595-3 |page=236 |chapter=Sedatives and hypnotics }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Exposure to benzodiazepines during pregnancy has been associated with a slightly increased (from 0.06 to 0.07%) risk of [[cleft lip and palate|cleft palate]] in newborns, a controversial conclusion as some studies find no association between benzodiazepines and cleft palate. Their use by expectant mothers shortly before the delivery may result in a [[floppy infant syndrome]], with the newborns suffering from [[hypotonia]], [[hypothermia]], [[lethargy]], and breathing and feeding difficulties.&lt;ref name=ACOG&gt;{{cite journal |author=American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists Committee on Practice Bulletins—Obstetrics |title=ACOG Practice Bulletin no. 92: Use of psychiatric medications during pregnancy and lactation |journal=[[Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology (journal)|Obstet Gynecol]] |volume=111 |issue=4 |pages=1001–20 |year=2008 | month = April |pmid=18378767 |doi=10.1097/AOG.0b013e31816fd910 |laysummary=http://www.guideline.gov/content.aspx?id=12490 |accessdate=2009-06-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid9748174&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dolovich LR, Addis A, Vaillancourt JM, Power JD, Koren G, Einarson TR |title=Benzodiazepine use in pregnancy and major malformations or oral cleft: meta-analysis of cohort and case-control studies |journal=[[BMJ]] |volume=317 |issue=7162 |pages=839–43 |year=1998 | month = September |pmid=9748174 |pmc=31092 |url=http://www.bmj.com/content/317/7162/839.full.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cases of [[neonatal withdrawal syndrome]] have been described in infants chronically exposed to benzodiazepines [[in utero]].

==Pharmacology==
Benzodiazepines share a similar chemical structure, and their effects in humans are mainly produced by the [[allosteric]] modification of a specific kind of [[neurotransmitter receptor]], the [[GABAA receptor|GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor]], which increases the conductance of this inhibitory channel; this results in the various therapeutic effects as well as adverse effects of benzodiazepines.&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn0-12-088397-X&quot;/&gt; Other less important mechanisms of action are also known.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid9504140&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16780077&quot;/&gt;

The red spheres labeled H1 and H2/A3 are, respectively, [[hydrogen bond]] donating and accepting sites in the receptor, while L1, L2, and L3 denote [[lipophilicity|lipophilic]] binding sites.]]

The term ''benzodiazepine'' is the [[IUPAC nomenclature|chemical name]] for the [[heterocycle|heterocyclic]] ring system (see figure to the right), which is a fusion between the [[benzene]] and [[diazepine]] ring systems.&lt;ref name=IUPAC&gt;{{BlueBook1993 |pages=40–3 }}; {{cite journal |author=Moss GP |year=1998 |title=Nomenclature of fused and bridged fused ring systems (IUPAC Recommendations 1998) |url=http://media.iupac.org/publications/pac/1998/pdf/7001x0143.pdf |journal=Pure Appl Chem |volume=70 |issue=1 |pages=143–216 |doi=10.1351/pac199870010143 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under [[Hantzsch–Widman nomenclature]], a [[diazepine]] is a heterocycle with two [[nitrogen]] atoms, five [[carbon]] atom and the maximum possible number of cumulative [[double bond]]s. The &quot;benzo&quot; prefix indicates the [[benzene]] ring fused onto the diazepine ring.&lt;ref name=&quot;IUPAC&quot; /&gt;

Benzodiazepine drugs are substituted 1,4-benzodiazepines, although the chemical term can refer to many other compounds that do not have useful pharmacological properties. Different benzodiazepine drugs have different side groups attached to this central structure. The different side groups affect the binding of the molecule to the GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor and so modulate the pharmacological properties.&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn0-12-088397-X&quot;/&gt; Many of the pharmacologically active &quot;classical&quot; benzodiazepine drugs contain the 5-phenyl-1''H''-benzo[''e''][1,4]diazepin-2(3''H'')-one substructure (see figure to the right).&lt;ref name=CAS&gt;[[CAS registry number]]:{{CAS|2898-08-0|1,3-dihydro-5-phenyl-2H-1,4-benzodiazepin-2-one}}; other names: Ro 05-2921, dechlorodemethyldiazepam.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nonbenzodiazepine]]s also bind to the benzodiazepine binding site on the GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor and possess similar pharmacological properties. While the nonbenzodiazepines are by definition structurally unrelated to the benzodiazepines, both classes of drugs possess a common [[pharmacophore]] (see figure to the lower-right), which explains their binding to a common receptor site.&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn0-471-21384-5&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Madsen U, Bräuner-Osborne H, Greenwood JR, Johansen TN, Krogsgaard-Larsen P, Liljefors T, Nielsen M, Frølund B |editor=Gad SC |title=Drug Discovery Handbook |publisher=Wiley-Interscience/J.

[[Image:GABAA-receptor-protein-example.png|thumb|left|alt=Figure of the GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor complex where the five subunits (two alpha, two beta, and one gamma) are symmetrically arranged in a pentagon shape about a central ion conduction pore.

Benzodiazepines work by increasing the efficiency of a natural brain chemical, [[gamma-Aminobutyric acid|GABA]], to decrease the excitability of [[neuron]]s. This reduces the communication between neurons and, therefore, has a calming effect on many of the functions of the brain.

GABA controls the excitability of neurons by binding to the [[GABAA receptor|GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor]].&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn0-12-088397-X&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Olsen RW, Betz H |editor=Siegel GJ, Albers RW, Brady S, Price DD (eds.) |title=Basic Neurochemistry: Molecular, Cellular and Medical Aspects |edition=7th |publisher=Elsevier |year=2006 |pages=291–302 |chapter=GABA and glycine |isbn=0-12-088397-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; The GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor is a [[multiprotein complex|protein complex]] located in the [[chemical synapse|synapses]] of neurons. All GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors contain an [[ion channel]] that conducts [[chloride]] ions across neuronal [[cell membrane]]s and two binding sites for the [[neurotransmitter]] gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), while a subset of GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor complexes also contain a single binding site for benzodiazepines. Binding of benzodiazepines to this receptor complex promotes binding of GABA, which in turn increases the conduction of chloride ions across the neuronal cell membrane. This increased conductance raises the [[membrane potential]] of the neuron, resulting in inhibition of neuronal [[action potential|firing]]. In addition, different GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor subtypes have varying distributions within different regions of the brain and, therefore, control distinct [[biological neural network|neuronal circuits]]. Hence, activation of different GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor subtypes by benzodiazepines may result in distinct pharmacological actions.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16376150&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Rudolph U, Möhler H |title=GABA-based therapeutic approaches: GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor subtype functions |journal=Curr Opin Pharmacol |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=18–23 |year=2006 |pmid=16376150 |doi=10.1016/j.coph.2005.10.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of the mechanism of action of benzodiazepines, their similarities are too great to separate them into individual categories such as anxiolytic or hypnotic. For example, a hypnotic administered in low doses will produce anxiety-relieving effects, whereas a benzodiazepine marketed as an anti-anxiety drug will at higher doses induce sleep.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Puri |first1=Basant K. |last2=Tyrer |first2=Peter |title=Sciences Basic to Psychiatry |url=http://books.google.com/?id=KTbfRIqjLtUC |accessdate=11-07-2009 |edition=2nd |date=28 August 1998 |publisher=Churchill Livingstone |isbn=978-0443055140 |pages=155–156 |chapter=Clinical psychopharmacology |chapterurl=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=KTbfRIqjLtUC&amp;pg=PA149 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The subset of GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors that also bind benzodiazepines are referred to as benzodiazepine receptors (BzR). The GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor is a [[heteromer]] composed of five subunits, the most common ones being two ''α''s, two ''β''s, and one ''γ'' (α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;β&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;γ). For each subunit, many subtypes exist (α&lt;sub&gt;1-6&lt;/sub&gt;, β&lt;sub&gt;1-3&lt;/sub&gt;, and γ&lt;sub&gt;1-3&lt;/sub&gt;). GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors that are made up of different combinations of subunit subtypes have different properties, different distributions in the brain and different activities relative to pharmacological and clinical effects.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid8783370&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Johnston GA |title=GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor pharmacology |journal=Pharmacol Ther |volume=69 |issue=3 |pages=173–98 |year=1996 |pmid=8783370 |doi=10.1016/0163-7258(95)02043-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Benzodiazepines bind at the interface of the α and γ subunits on the GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor. Binding also requires that alpha subunits contain a [[histidine]] amino acid residue, (''i.e.'', [[GABRA1|α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[GABRA2|α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[GABRA3|α&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]], and [[GABRA5|α&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;]] containing GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors). For this reason, benzodiazepines show no affinity for GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors containing [[GABRA4|α&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[GABRA6|α&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]] subunits with an [[arginine]] instead of a histidine residue.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15157182&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wafford KA, Macaulay AJ, Fradley R, O'Meara GF, Reynolds DS, Rosahl TW |title=Differentiating the role of gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;) receptor subtypes |journal=Biochem Soc Trans |volume=32 |issue=Pt3 |pages=553–6 |year=2004 |pmid=15157182 |doi=10.1042/BST0320553 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once bound to the benzodiazepine receptor, the benzodiazepine [[ligand (biochemistry)|ligand]] locks the benzodiazepine receptor into a conformation in which it has a greater affinity for the [[gamma-aminobutyric acid|GABA]] [[neurotransmitter]]. This increases the frequency of the opening of the associated chloride [[ion channel]] and [[hyperpolarization (biology)|hyperpolarizes]] the membrane of the associated neuron. The inhibitory effect of the available GABA is potentiated, leading to sedatory and anxiolytic effects. Furthermore, different benzodiazepines can have different affinities for BzRs made up of different collection of subunits. For instance, those with high activity at the α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; are associated with stronger [[hypnotic]] effects, whereas those with higher affinity for GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors containing α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and/or α&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; subunits have good anti-anxiety activity.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid9824848&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hevers W, Lüddens H |title=The diversity of GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors.

The benzodiazepine class of drugs also interact with [[translocator protein|peripheral benzodiazepine receptors]].

==Pharmacokinetics==
A benzodiazepine can be placed into one of three groups by its [[elimination half-life]], or time it takes for the body to eliminate half of the dose. Some benzodiazepines have long-acting [[active metabolites]], such as diazepam and chlordiazepoxide, which are metabolised into [[desmethyldiazepam]]. Desmethyldiazepam has a half-life of 36–200 hours, and flurazepam, with the main active metabolite of desalkylflurazepam, with a half-life of 40–250 hours. These long-acting metabolites are [[partial agonists]].&lt;ref name=sddat&gt;{{cite book |author=Dikeos DG, Theleritis CG, Soldatos CR |chapter=Benzodiazepines: effects on sleep |pages=220–2 |title=Sleep Disorders: Diagnosis and Therapeutics |editor=Pandi-Perumal SR, Verster JC, Monti JM, Lader M, Langer SZ (eds.) |publisher=Informa Healthcare |year=2008 |isbn=0-415-43818-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;manual&quot; /&gt;
* Short-acting compounds have a median half-life of 1–12 hours. They have few residual effects if taken before bedtime, [[rebound insomnia]] may occur upon discontinuation, and they might cause day time withdrawal symptoms such as next day [[rebound anxiety]] with prolonged usage. Examples are [[brotizolam]], [[midazolam]], and [[triazolam]].
* Intermediate-acting compounds have a median half-life of 12–40 hours. They may have some residual effects in the first half of the day if used as a [[hypnotic]]. Rebound insomnia, however, is more common upon discontinuation of intermediate-acting benzodiazepines than longer-acting benzodiazepines. Examples are [[alprazolam]], [[estazolam]], [[flunitrazepam]], [[clonazepam]], [[lormetazepam]], [[lorazepam]], [[nitrazepam]], and [[temazepam]].
* Long-acting compounds have a half-life of 40–250 hours. They have a risk of accumulation in the elderly and in individuals with severely impaired liver function, but they have a reduced severity of [[rebound effects]] and [[withdrawal]]. Examples are [[diazepam]], [[chlorazepate]], [[chlordiazepoxide]], and [[flurazepam]].

==Interactions==
Individual benzodiazepines may have different [[drug interaction|interactions]] with certain drugs. Depending on their [[metabolism]] pathway, benzodiazepines can be roughly divided into two groups. The largest group consists of those that are metabolized by [[cytochrome P450]] (CYP450) enzymes and possess significant potential for interactions with other drugs. The other group comprises those that are metabolized through [[glucuronidation]], such as [[lorazepam]], [[oxazepam]], and [[temazepam]], and, in general, have few drug interactions.&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn0-444-50998-4&quot;&gt;{{cite book |editor=Meyler L, Aronson JK |title=Meyler's Side Effects of Drugs: the International Encyclopedia of Adverse Drug Reactions and Interactions |edition=15th |publisher=Elsevier |year=2006 |pages=429–43 |isbn=0-444-50998-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many drugs, including [[combined oral contraceptive pill|oral contraceptives]], some [[antibiotic]]s, [[antidepressant]]s, and [[antifungal]] agents, inhibit cytochrome enzymes in the liver. They reduce the rate of elimination of the benzodiazepines that are metabolized by CYP450, leading to possibly excessive drug accumulation and increased side-effects. In contrast, drugs that induce cytochrome P450 enzymes, such as [[St John's wort]], the antibiotic [[rifampicin]], and the [[anticonvulsants]] [[carbamazepine]] and [[phenytoin]], accelerate elimination of many benzodiazepines and decrease their action.&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn1-58829-211-8&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;biadmtad&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Norman TR, Ellen SR, Burrows GD |title=Benzodiazepines in anxiety disorders: managing therapeutics and dependence |journal=Med J Aust |volume=167 |issue=9 |pages=490–5 |year=1997 |pmid=9397065 |url=http://www.mja.com.au/public/mentalhealth/course/06norman.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Taking benzodiazepines with alcohol, [[opioid]]s and other [[depressant|central nervous system depressants]] potentiates their action.

It was marketed by [[Hoffmann–La Roche]] from 1960 branded as ''Librium''.]]

The first benzodiazepine, [[chlordiazepoxide]] (''Librium''), was synthesized in 1955 by [[Leo Sternbach]] while working at [[Hoffmann–La Roche]] on the development of tranquilizers. The pharmacological properties of the compounds prepared initially were disappointing, and Sternbach abandoned the project. Two years later, in April 1957, co-worker Earl Reeder noticed a &quot;nicely crystalline&quot; compound left over from the discontinued project while spring-cleaning in the lab. This compound, later named chlordiazepoxide, had not been tested in 1955 because of Sternbach's focus on other issues. Expecting the pharmacology results to be negative and hoping to publish the chemistry-related findings, researchers submitted it for a standard battery of animal tests. However, the compound showed very strong [[sedative]], [[anticonvulsant]], and [[muscle relaxant]] effects. These impressive clinical findings led to its speedy introduction throughout the world in 1960 under the brand name ''Librium''.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid34039&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sternbach LH |title=The benzodiazepine story |journal=J Med Chem |volume=22 |issue=1 |pages=1–7 |year=1979 |pmid=34039 |doi=10.1021/jm00187a001 |quote=During this cleanup operation, my co-worker, Earl Reeder, drew my attention to a few hundred milligrams of two products, a nicely crystalline base and its hydrochloride.

[[Oxazepam]] was synthesized in 1961, [[nitrazepam]] in 1962, and [[temazepam]] and [[nimetazepam]] in 1964. In 1965 came [[flurazepam]] and [[nordazepam]]. The introduction of benzodiazepines led to a decrease in the prescription of [[barbiturate]]s, and by the 1970s they had largely replaced the older drugs for sedative and [[hypnotic]] uses.&lt;ref name=isbn0-19-517668-5&gt;{{cite book |author=Shorter E |title=A Historical Dictionary of Psychiatry |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2005 |chapter=Benzodiazepines |pages=41–2 |isbn=0-19-517668-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new group of drugs was initially greeted with optimism by the medical profession, but gradually concerns arose; in particular, the risk of dependence became evident in the 1980s. Benzodiazepines have a unique history in that they were responsible for the largest-ever [[class-action lawsuit]] against [[drugs manufacturers|drug manufacturers]] in the United Kingdom, involving 14,000 patients and 1,800 [[law firms]] that alleged the manufacturers knew of the dependence potential but intentionally withheld this information from doctors. At the same time, 117 general practitioners and 50 health authorities were sued by patients to recover damages for the harmful effects of [[benzodiazepine dependence|dependence]] and [[withdrawal]]. This led some doctors to require a signed consent form from their patients and to recommend that all patients be adequately warned of the risks of dependence and withdrawal before starting treatment with benzodiazepines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=King MB |title=Is there still a role for benzodiazepines in general practice? |journal=Br J Gen Pract |volume=42 |issue=358 |pages=202–5 |year=1992 |pmid=1389432 |pmc=1372025 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The court case against the drug manufacturers never reached a verdict; [[legal aid]] had been withdrawn and there were allegations that the consultant psychiatrists, the expert witnesses, had a conflict of interest. This litigation led to changes in the [[British law]], making class action law suits more difficult.&lt;ref name=&quot;urlHouse of Commons&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199899/cmselect/cmhealth/549/99072723.htm |title=Memorandum by Dr Reg Peart |author=Peart R |date=1999-06-01 |work=Minutes of Evidence |publisher=Select Committee on Health, House of Commons, UK Parliament |accessdate=2009-05-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, formerly classified documents from a [[Medical Research Council (UK)]] meeting of experts emerged and revealed that the MRC was aware of research 30 years ago that suggested that benzodiazepines could cause brain damage in some people similar to that which occurs from alcohol abuse and failed to follow-up with larger clinical trials. The MRC turned down research proposals in the 1980s by Professor Lader and also proposals by Professor Ashton in 1995 to study whether benzodiazepines had permanent effects on the brain. The MRC responded that it has always been open to research proposals in this area that meet required standards. It was further alleged that the MRC documents were relevant to a large class-action lawsuit, which started in the mid-1980s against drug companies and one solicitor stated that it was strange that the MRC had 'hidden' the documents. [[Jim Dobbin]], MP and chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Involuntary Tranquilliser Addiction, described the documents as a &quot;huge scandal,&quot; given the large number of people who experience symptoms such as physical, cognitive, and psychological problems as a result of benzodiazepine use, which can persist even after withdrawing.&lt;ref name=dltbd30ya&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/drugs-linked-to-brain-damage-30-years-ago-2127504.html |title=Drugs linked to brain damage 30 years ago |author=Nina Lakhani |date=7 November 2010 |publisher=The Independent on Sunday |location=United Kingdom }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As in humans, they are used in the first-line management of [[seizures]], [[status epilepticus]], and [[tetanus]], and as maintenance therapy in epilepsy (in particular, in cats).&lt;ref name = MVM&gt;{{cite book |editor=Kahn CM, Line S, Aiello SE |title=[[Merck Veterinary Manual|The Merck Veterinary Manual]]|year=2005 |publisher=Wiley |edition=9th |isbn=978-0911910506 |accessdate=2009-06-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Frey HH |title=Anticonvulsant drugs used in the treatment of epilepsy |journal=Probl Vet Med |volume=1 |issue=4 |pages=558–77 |year=1989 |pmid=2520134 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Podell M |journal=Vet Clin North Am Small Anim Pract |title=Seizures in dogs |volume=26 |issue=4 |pages=779–809 |year=1996 |pmid=8813750 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are widely used in small and large animals (including horses, swine, cattle and exotic and wild animals) for their anxiolytic and sedative effects, as pre medication before surgery, for induction of [[anesthesia]] and as adjuncts to anesthesia.&lt;ref name = MVM/&gt;&lt;ref name=Adams&gt;{{cite book |author=Gross ME |chapter=Tranquilizers, &amp;alpha;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-adrenergic agonists, and related agents |editor=Adams RH (ed.) |title=Veterinary Pharmacology and Therapeutics |edition=8th |publisher=Iowa State University Press |year=2001 |pages=325–33 |isbn=0-8138-1743-9 |accessdate=2009-06-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''body mass index''' ('''BMI'''), or '''Quetelet index''', is a [[heuristic]] proxy for human body fat based on an individual's weight and height. BMI does not actually measure the [[Body fat percentage|percentage of body fat]]. It was invented between 1830 and 1850 by the [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[polymath]] [[Adolphe Quetelet]] during the course of developing &quot;social physics&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Eknoyan| first=Garabed| year=2008| month=January| title=Adolphe Quetelet (1796–1874)—the average man and indices of obesity| journal=Nephrol.

Body mass index is defined as the individual's body weight divided by the square of his or her height. The formulae universally used in medicine produce a [[Units of measurement|unit of measure]] of kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.
BMI can also be determined using a BMI chart,&lt;ref&gt;E.g., the [http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/guidelines/obesity/bmi_tbl.htm Body Mass Index Table] from the [[NIH]]'s NHLBI.&lt;/ref&gt; which displays BMI as a function of weight (horizontal axis) and height (vertical axis) using contour lines for different values of BMI or colors for different BMI categories.

==Usage==
While the formula previously called the Quetelet Index for BMI dates to the 19th century, the new term &quot;body mass index&quot; for the ratio and its popularity date to a paper published in the July edition of 1972 in the ''Journal of Chronic Diseases'' by [[Ancel Keys]], which found the BMI to be the best proxy for body fat percentage among ratios of weight and height;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slate.com/id/2223095/ Beyond BMI: Why doctors won't stop using an outdated measure for obesity.], by Jeremy Singer-Vine, [[Slate.com]], July 20, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; the interest in measuring body fat being due to obesity becoming a discernible issue in prosperous Western societies. BMI was explicitly cited by Keys as being appropriate for ''population'' studies, and inappropriate for individual diagnosis. Nevertheless, due to its simplicity, it came to be widely used for individual diagnosis, despite its inappropriateness.

BMI provided a simple numeric measure of a person's &quot;fatness&quot; or &quot;thinness&quot;, allowing health professionals to discuss over- and under-weight problems more objectively with their patients. However, BMI has become controversial because many people, including physicians, have come to rely on its apparent numerical authority for medical diagnosis, but that was never the BMI's purpose; it is meant to be used as a simple means of classifying sedentary (physically inactive) individuals with an average body composition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal = WHO Technical Report Series| volume = 854 | title = Physical Status: The Use and Interpretation of Anthropometry|page = 9 |url = http://whqlibdoc.who.int/trs/WHO_TRS_854.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; For these individuals, the current value settings are as follows: a BMI of 20 to 25 may indicate optimal weight; a BMI lower than 20 suggests the person is [[underweight]] while a number above 25 may indicate the person is [[overweight]]; a person may have a BMI below 20 due to disease; a number above 30 suggests the person is [[obesity|obese]] (over 40, morbidly obese).

For a given height, BMI is proportional to mass. However, for a given mass, BMI is inversely proportional to the ''square'' of the height. So, if all body dimensions double, and mass scales naturally with the cube of the height, then BMI doubles instead of remaining the same. This results in taller people having a reported BMI that is uncharacteristically high compared to their actual body fat levels. In comparison, the [[Ponderal index]] is based on this natural scaling of mass with the third power of the height. However, many taller people are not just &quot;scaled up&quot; short people, but tend to have narrower frames in proportion to their height. It has been suggested that instead of squaring the body height (as the BMI does) or cubing the body height (as the [[Ponderal index]] does), it would be more appropriate to use an exponent of between 2.3 and 2.7.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.math.utah.edu/~korevaar/ACCESS2003/bmi.pdf|title = Calculation of power law relationship between weight and height}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==BMI Prime==
'''BMI Prime''', a simple modification of the BMI system, is the ratio of actual BMI to upper limit BMI (currently defined at BMI 25). As defined, BMI Prime is also the ratio of body weight to upper body weight limit, calculated at BMI 25. Since it is the ratio of two separate BMI values, BMI Prime is a [[dimensionless number]], without associated units. Individuals with BMI Prime &lt; 0.74 are underweight; those between 0.74 and 0.99 have optimal weight; and those at 1.00 or greater are overweight. BMI Prime is useful clinically because individuals can tell, at a glance, by what percentage they deviate from their upper weight limits. For instance, a person with BMI 34 has a BMI Prime of 34/25 = 1.36, and is 36% over his or her upper mass limit. In Asian populations (see International Variation section below) BMI Prime should be calculated using an upper limit BMI of 23 in the denominator instead of 25. Nonetheless, BMI Prime allows easy comparison between populations whose upper limit BMI values differ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Gadzik|first = J|title = 'How Much Should I Weigh?' - Quetelet's Equation, Upper Weight Limits and BMI Prime|journal = Connecticut Medicine| month = February|year = 2006|volume = 70|issue = 2|pages = 81–8|pmid = 16768059}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Categories==
A frequent use of the BMI is to assess how much an individual's body weight departs from what is normal or desirable for a person of his or her height. The weight excess or deficiency may, in part, be accounted for by body fat ([[adipose tissue]]) although other factors such as muscularity also affect BMI significantly (see discussion below and [[overweight]]). The [[World Health Organization|WHO]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.who.int/bmi/index.jsp?introPage=intro_3.html|title = BMI Classification|publisher = World Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt; regard a BMI of less than 18.5 as underweight and may indicate [[malnutrition]], an [[eating disorder]], or other health problems, while a BMI greater than 25 is considered overweight and above 30 is considered [[obesity|obese]]. These ranges of BMI values are valid only as statistical categories when applied to adults, and do not predict health.

The U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey of 1994 indicates that 59% of American men and 49% of women have BMIs over 25. Morbid obesity—a BMI of 40 or more—was found in 2% of the men and 4% of the women. The newest survey in 2007 indicates a continuation of the increase in BMI:  63% of Americans are overweight, with 26% now in the obese category (a BMI of 30 or more). There are differing opinions on the threshold for being underweight in females; doctors quote anything from 18.5 to 20 as being the lowest weight, the most frequently stated being 19.  A BMI nearing 15 is usually used as an indicator for starvation and the health risks involved, with a BMI &lt;17.5 being an informal criterion for the diagnosis of [[anorexia nervosa]].

BMI is used differently for [[child]]ren. It is calculated the same way as for adults, but then compared to typical values for other children of the same age. Instead of set thresholds for underweight and overweight, then, the BMI [[percentile]] allows comparison with children of the same sex and age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dnpa/healthyweight/assessing/bmi/childrens_BMI/about_childrens_BMI.htm|title = Body Mass Index: BMI for Children and Teens|publisher = Center for Disease Control}}&lt;/ref&gt; A BMI that is less than the 5th percentile is considered underweight and above the 95th percentile is considered obese for people 20 and older. People under 20 with a BMI between the 85th and 95th percentile are considered to be overweight.

Recent studies in Britain have indicated that females between the ages 12 and 16 have a higher BMI than males of the same age by 1.0&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; on average.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.archive2.official-documents.co.uk/document/deps/doh/survey02/summ03.htm|title = Health Survey for England: The Health of Children and Young People}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International variations===
These recommended distinctions along the linear scale may vary from time to time and country to country, making global, longitudinal surveys problematic. In 1998, the U.S. [[National Institutes of Health]] brought U.S. definitions into line with [[World Health Organization]] guidelines, lowering the normal/overweight cut-off from BMI 27.8 to BMI 25. This had the effect of redefining approximately 25 million Americans, previously &quot;healthy&quot; to &quot;overweight&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.cnn.com/HEALTH/9806/17/weight.guidelines/|title = Who's fat? New definition adopted | work=CNN | accessdate=2010-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also recommends lowering the normal/overweight threshold for South East Asian body types to around BMI 23, and expects further revisions to emerge from clinical studies of different body types.

In Singapore, the BMI cut-off figures were revised in 2005 with an emphasis on health risks instead of weight. Adults whose BMI is between 18.5 and 22.9 have a low risk of developing heart disease and other health problems such as diabetes. Those with a BMI between 23 and 27.4 are at moderate risk while those with a BMI of 27.5 and above are at high risk of heart disease and other types of  health problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.hpb.gov.sg/hpb/default.asp?TEMPORARY_DOCUMENT=1769&amp;TEMPORARY_TEMPLATE=2|title = Revision of Body Mass Index (BMI) Cut-Offs In Singapore}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
===Statistical device===
The BMI is generally used as a means of correlation between groups related by general mass and can serve as a vague means of estimating [[adipose tissue|adiposity]]. The duality of the BMI is that, whilst easy-to-use as a general calculation, it is limited in how accurate and pertinent the data obtained from it can be. Generally, the index is suitable for recognizing trends within sedentary or overweight individuals because there is a smaller margin for errors.&lt;ref name=&quot;jxbvhf&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1= Jeukendrup|first1 = A.|last2 = Gleeson|first2 = M.|year = 2005|title = Sports Nutrition|publisher = Human Kinetics: An Introduction to Energy Production and Performance| isbn = 9780736034043}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This general correlation is particularly useful for consensus data regarding obesity or various other conditions because it can be used to build a semi-accurate representation from which a solution can be stipulated, or the [[Recommended Dietary Allowance|RDA]] for a group can be calculated. Similarly, this is becoming more and more pertinent to the growth of children, due to the majority of their exercise habits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Barasi|first = M. E.|year = 2004|title = Human Nutrition - a health perspective|isbn = 0340810254}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The growth of children is usually documented against a BMI-measured growth chart. Obesity trends can be calculated from the difference between the child's BMI and the BMI on the chart.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

===Clinical practice===
BMI has been used by the [[World Health Organization|WHO]] as the standard for recording obesity statistics since the early 1980s. In the United States, BMI is also used as a measure of underweight, owing to advocacy on behalf of those suffering with eating disorders, such as [[anorexia nervosa]] and [[bulimia nervosa]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}

BMI can be calculated quickly and without expensive equipment. However, BMI categories do not take into account many factors such as [[anthropometry|frame size]] and muscularity.&lt;ref name=&quot;jxbvhf&quot;/&gt; The categories also fail to account for varying proportions of fat, bone, cartilage, water weight, and more.

Despite this, BMI categories are regularly regarded as a satisfactory tool for measuring whether sedentary individuals are &quot;underweight&quot;, &quot;overweight&quot; or &quot;obese&quot; with various exemptions, such as: athletes, children, the elderly, and the infirm.

One basic problem, especially in athletes, is that muscle weight contributes to BMI. Some professional athletes would be &quot;overweight&quot; or &quot;obese&quot; according to their BMI, despite them carrying little fat, unless the number at which they are considered &quot;overweight&quot; or &quot;obese&quot; is adjusted upward in some modified version of the calculation. In children and the elderly, differences in bone density and, thus, in the proportion of bone to total weight can mean the number at which these people are considered ''under''weight should be adjusted downward.

===Medical underwriting===
In the United States, where [[medical underwriting]] of private health insurance plans is widespread, most private health insurance providers will use a particular high BMI as a cut-off point in order to raise insurance rates for or deny insurance to higher-risk patients, thereby reducing the cost of insurance coverage to all other subscribers in a 'normal' BMI range. The cutoff point is determined differently for every health insurance provider and different providers will have vastly different ranges of acceptability. Many will implement phased surcharges, in which the subscriber will pay an additional penalty, usually as a percentage of the monthly premium, for each arbitrary range of BMI points above a certain acceptable limit, up to a maximum BMI past which the individual will simply be denied admissibility regardless of price. This can be contrasted with [[group insurance policies]] which do not require medical underwriting and where insurance admissibility is guaranteed by virtue of being a member of the insured group, regardless of BMI or other risk factors that would likely render the individual inadmissible to an individual health plan.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

The medical establishment has generally acknowledged some shortcomings of BMI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/public/heart/obesity/lose_wt/risk.htm#limitations|title=Aim for a Healthy Weight: Assess your Risk|publisher=National Institutes of Health|date=2007-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the BMI formula depends only upon weight and height, its assumptions about the distribution between lean mass and adipose tissue are not always exact.  BMI sometimes overestimates [[adipose tissue|adiposity]] on those with more lean body mass (e.g., athletes) while greatly under-estimating excess adiposity on those with less lean body mass. A study in June, 2008 by Romero-Corral et al. examined 13,601 subjects from the United States' [[NHANES|Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III)]] and found that BMI-defined obesity was present in 21% of men and 31% of women. Using [[body fat percentages]] (BF%), however, BF%-defined obesity was found in 50% of men and 62% of women.  While BMI-defined obesity showed high [[Sensitivity and specificity|specificity]] (95% of men and 99% of women presenting BMI-defined obesity also presented BF%-defined obesity), BMI showed poor [[Sensitivity and specificity|sensitivity]] (BMI only identified 36% of the men and 49% of the women who presented BF%-defined obesity).&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;&lt;!-- Request: A [[WP:RS]] is needed for this [[WP:OR]]  It also does not differentiate between short-limbed long-torsoed individuals who generally have more lean weight than average and short-torsoed, long-limbed people from hotter climates who generally have less lean weight than average.

A study published by [[Journal of the American Medical Association|JAMA]] in 2005 showed that &quot;overweight&quot; people had a similar relative risk of mortality to &quot;normal&quot; weight people as defined by BMI, while &quot;underweight&quot; and &quot;obese&quot; people had a higher death rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first1 = K.

In an analysis of 40 studies involving 250,000 people, patients with coronary artery disease with &quot;normal&quot; BMIs were at higher risk of death from cardiovascular disease than people whose BMIs put them in the &quot;overweight&quot; range (BMI 25–29.9).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Romero-Corral A, Montori VM, Somers VK, ''et al.'' |title=Association of bodyweight with total mortality and with cardiovascular events in coronary artery disease: a systematic review of cohort studies |journal=Lancet |volume=368 |issue=9536 |pages=666–78 |year=2006 |month=August |pmid=16920472 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(06)69251-9 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140-6736(06)69251-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the &quot;overweight&quot;, or intermediate, range of BMI (25–29.9), the study found that BMI failed to discriminate between bodyfat percentage and lean mass. The study concluded that &quot;the accuracy of BMI in diagnosing obesity is limited, particularly for individuals in the intermediate BMI ranges, in men and in the elderly. ...

A 2010 study that followed 11,000 subjects for up to eight years concluded that BMI is not a good measure for the risk of heart attack, stroke or death. A better measure was found to be the [[waist-to-height ratio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The predictive value of different measures of obesity for incident cardiovascular events and mortality.|author=Schneider ''et al.''|journal=The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology &amp; Metabolism|volume=95|number=4|date=2010|pages=1777-1785|url=http://jcem.endojournals.org/cgi/content/full/95/4/1777}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Body composition for athletes is often better calculated using measures of [[Body fat percentage|body fat]], as determined by such techniques as skinfold measurements or underwater weighing and the limitations of manual measurement have also led to new, alternative methods to measure obesity, such as the [[body volume index]]. However, recent studies of [[American football]] [[lineman (American football)|linemen]] who undergo intensive weight training to increase their muscle mass show that they frequently suffer many of the same problems as people ordinarily considered obese, notably [[sleep apnea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Brown|first= David|title = Linemen More Likely To Have Sleep Condition|publisher = [[The Washington Post]]|date = January 23, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/29/AR2007012900606.html|title = Ex-NFL Linemen prone to Heart Disease|publisher = The Washington Post|date = January 29, 2007 | first=Steven | last=Reinberg | accessdate=2010-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A further limitation relates to loss of height through aging. In this situation, BMI will increase without any corresponding increase in weight.

The exponent of 2 in the denominator of the formula for BMI is arbitrary. It is meant to reduce variability in the BMI associated only with a difference in size, rather than with differences in weight relative to one's ideal weight. If taller people were simply scaled-up versions of shorter people, the appropriate exponent would be 3, as weight would increase with the cube of height. However, on average, taller people have a slimmer build relative to their height than do shorter people, and the exponent which matches the variation best is between 2 and 3. An analysis based on data gathered in the USA suggested an exponent of 2.6 would yield the best fit for children aged 2 to 19 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.math.utah.edu/~korevaar/ACCESS2003/bmi.pdf|title = Power law fit to USA weight and height data}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exponent 2 is used instead by convention and for simplicity.

As a possible alternative to BMI, the concepts [[fat-free mass index]] (FFMI) and [[fat mass index]] (FMI) were introduced in the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1= VanItallie|first1= T.B.|coauthors= Yang, M.U.; Heymsfield, S.B.; Funk, R.C.; Boileau, R.A.|title = Height-normalized indices of the body's fat-free mass and fat mass: potentially useful indicators of nutritional status|journal = Am. J. Clin. Nutr.|month = December|year = 1990|volume = 52|issue = 6|pages =953–9|pmid= 2239792}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Varying standards===
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2010}}
It is not clear where on the BMI scale the threshold for “[[overweight]]” and “[[obese]]” should be set. Because of this the standards have varied over the past few decades. Between 1980 and 2000 the U.S. Dietary Guidelines have defined overweight at a variety of levels ranging from a BMI of 24.9 to 27.1. In 1985 the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) consensus conference recommended that overweight BMI be set at a BMI of 27.8 for men and 27.3 for women. In 1988 a NIH report concluded that a BMI over 25 is overweight and a BMI over 30 is obese. In the 1990s the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) decided that a BMI of 25 to 29 should be considered overweight and a BMI over 30 is obese, the standards the NIH set. This became the definitive guide for determining if someone is overweight.

However, the current WHO and NIH ranges were not established with references to any scientific study, but are arbitrary ranges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.halls.md/ideal-weight/medical.htm|title=About the &quot;Medical Recommendation&quot; of Ideal Weight|date=2010-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Behistun Inscription''' (also '''Bistun''' or '''Bisutun''', [[Modern Persian]]: بیستون &lt; [[Old Persian]]: '''Bagastana''', meaning &quot;the place of gods&quot;) is a multi-lingual inscription located on [[Mount Behistun]] in the [[Kermanshah Province]] of [[Iran]], near the city of [[Kermanshah]] in western Iran.

Authored by [[Darius the Great]] sometime between his coronation as king of the [[Persian Empire]] in the summer of 522 BC and his death in autumn of 486 BC, the inscription begins with a brief autobiography of Darius, including his ancestry and lineage. Later in the inscription, Darius provides a lengthy sequence of events following the deaths of [[Cyrus the Great]] and [[Cambyses II]] in which he fought nineteen battles in a period of one year (ending in December of 521 BC) to put down multiple rebellions throughout the Persian Empire.  The inscription states in detail that the rebellions, which had resulted from the deaths of Cyrus the Great and his son Cambyses II, were orchestrated by several impostors and their co-conspirators in various cities throughout the empire, each of whom falsely proclaimed kinghood during the upheaval following Cyrus's death.

Darius the Great proclaimed himself victorious in all battles during the period of upheaval, attributing his success to the &quot;grace of [[Ahuramazda|Ahura Mazda]]&quot;.

The inscription includes three versions of the same text, written in three different [[cuneiform script]] languages: Old Persian, [[Elamite language|Elamite]], and [[Babylonian language|Babylonian]] (a later form of [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]]) &amp;mdash; Babylonian being a [[Semitic languages|Semitic language]]. In effect, then, the inscription is to [[cuneiform script|cuneiform]] what the [[Rosetta Stone]] is to [[Egyptian hieroglyph]]s: the document most crucial in the [[decipherment]] of a previously lost [[writing system|script]].

Translation of the text was a multi-step and multi-national effort based on earlier work done on the decipherment of the Old Persian script by [[Georg Friedrich Grotefend]] in the late 18th century when Grotefend discovered that, unlike Elamite and Babylonian texts, Old Persian text is alphabetic.  In the following years, the efforts of [[Eugène Burnouf|Burnouf]], [[Christian Lassen|Lassen]], and [[Sir Henry Rawlinson, 1st Baronet|Rawlinson]] (who had the remainder of the inscription transcribed in two parts, in 1835 and 1843) contributed to translating the Old Persian cuneiform text using the [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] book ''[[Avesta]]'' as a key, in addition to cross-referencing with modern [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Vedic]] languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vohuman.org/Article/The%20First%20European%20Translation%20of%20the%20Holy%20Avesta.htm |title=The First European Translation of the Holy Avesta |publisher=Vohuman.org |date= |accessdate=2010-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the Old Persian text deciphered, Rawlinson and others were then able to decipher the Elamite and Babylonian texts (both of which were translations of the Old Persian text).

[[Image:BehistunLedge.jpg|225px|thumb|right|The ledge below the inscription]]
The inscription is approximately 15&amp;nbsp;metres high by 25&amp;nbsp;metres wide and 100&amp;nbsp;metres up a [[limestone]] cliff from an ancient road connecting the capitals of [[Babylonia]] and [[Medes|Media]] ([[Babylon]] and [[Ecbatana]], respectively). The Old Persian text contains 414 lines in five columns; the Elamite text includes 593 lines in eight columns, and the Babylonian text is in 112 lines. The inscription was illustrated by a life-sized bas-relief of [[Darius the Great|Darius I, the Great]], holding a [[bow (weapon)|bow]] as a sign of kingship, with his left foot on the chest of a figure lying on his back before him.  The supine figure is reputed to be the [[pretender]] [[Gaumata]].  Darius is attended to the left by two servants, and ten one-metre figures stand to the right, with hands tied and rope around their necks, representing conquered peoples.  [[Faravahar]] floats above, giving his blessing to the king. One figure appears to have been added after the others were completed, as was (oddly enough) Darius's beard, which is a separate block of stone attached with [[iron]] pins and [[lead]].

==Ancient history==
After the fall of the Persian Empire's [[Achaemenid Dynasty]] and its successors, and the lapse of Old Persian cuneiform writing into disuse, the nature of the inscription was forgotten, and fanciful explanations became the norm. For centuries, instead of being attributed to Darius I, the Great, it was believed to be from the reign of [[Khosrau II]] of [[Persia]] — one of the last [[Sassanid]] kings, who lived over 1000 years after the time of Darius I.

The inscription is mentioned by [[Ctesias|Ctesias of Cnidus]], who noted its existence some time around 400 BC and mentioned a well and a garden beneath the inscription. He incorrectly concluded that the inscription had been dedicated &quot;by Queen [[Semiramis of Babylon]] to [[Zeus]]&quot;. [[Gaius Cornelius Tacitus|Tacitus]] also mentions it and includes a description of some of the long-lost ancillary monuments at the base of the cliff, including an altar to &quot;[[Herakles]]&quot;. What has been recovered of them, including a statue dedicated in 148 BC, is consistent with Tacitus's description. [[Diodorus Siculus|Diodorus]] also writes of &quot;Bagistanon&quot; and claims it was inscribed by Semiramis.

A legend began around [[Mount Behistun]] (Bisutun), as written about by the [[Persian literature|Persian poet and writer]] [[Firdausi]] in his ''[[Shahnamah]]'' (''Book of Kings'') circa AD 1000, about a man named [[Farhad]], who was a lover of King  Khosrow's wife, [[Shirin]]. The legend states that, exiled for his transgression, Farhad was given the task of cutting away the mountain to find water; if he succeeded, he would be given permission to marry Shirin. After many years and the removal of half the mountain, he did find water, but was informed by Khosrow that Shirin had died. He went mad, threw his axe down the hill, kissed the ground and died. It is told in the book of [[Khosrow and Shirin]] that his axe was made out of a pomegranate tree, and, where he threw the axe, a pomegranate tree grew with fruit that would cure the ill. Shirin was not dead, according to the story, and mourned upon hearing the news.

==Later historical references==
{{refimprove|section|date=August 2010}}
The inscription was noted by an Arab traveller, [[Ibn Hawqal]], during the mid-10th century, who misinterpreted the figures as a &quot;teacher punishing his pupils&quot;.  In 1598, the [[England|Englishman]] [[Robert Sherley]] saw the inscription during a diplomatic mission to [[Iran|Persia]] on behalf of [[Austria]], and brought it to the attention of Western European scholars. His party incorrectly came to the conclusion that it was a picture of &quot;the [[Ascension of Jesus Christ|ascension]] of [[Jesus]]&quot; with an inscription in &quot;Greek&quot;.

Biblical misinterpretations by Europeans were rife for the next two centuries.  French General Gardanne thought it showed &quot;Christ and his [[twelve apostles]]&quot;, and [[Robert Ker Porter|Sir Robert Ker Porter]] thought it represented the &quot;twelve [[tribes of Israel]] and [[Shalmaneser I|Shalmaneser of Assyria]]&quot;. Italian explorer [[Pietro della Valle]] visited the inscription in the course of a pilgrimage in around 1621, and German surveyor [[Carsten Niebuhr]] visited in around 1764 for [[Frederick V of Denmark]], publishing a copy of the inscription in the account of his journeys in 1777.

==Translation==
[[Image:Behistun DB1 1-15.jpg|thumb|330px|Column 1 (DB I 1-15), sketch by [[Friedrich von Spiegel]] (1881)]]
Niebuhr's transcriptions were used by [[Georg Friedrich Grotefend]] and others in their efforts to decipher the Old Persian cuneiform script. Grotefend had deciphered ten of the 37 symbols of Old Persian by 1802, after realizing that unlike the Semitic cuneiform scripts, Old Persian text is alphabetic and each word is separated by a vertical slanted symbol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ancientscripts.com/oldpersian.html |title=Old Persian |publisher=Ancient Scripts |date= |accessdate=2010-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=46097&amp;URL_DO=DO_PRINTPAGE&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |title=Focus |publisher=Portal.unesco.org |date=2009-07-15 |accessdate=2010-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Old Persian text was copied and deciphered before the recovery and copying of the Elamite and Babylonian inscriptions had even been attempted, which proved to be a good deciphering strategy, since Old Persian script was easier to study due to its alphabetic nature and the fact that the language it represents had naturally evolved into [[Middle Persian]], and in turn, to the living modern [[Persian language]] dialects as well as the [[Avestan]] language, used in the [[Zoroastrian]] book the ''[[Avesta]]''.

In 1835, [[Sir Henry Rawlinson, 1st Baronet|Sir Henry Rawlinson]], an officer of the [[British East India Company]] army assigned to the forces of the [[Shah]] of Iran, began studying the inscription in earnest. As the town of Bisutun's name was anglicized as &quot;Behistun&quot; at this time, the monument became known as the &quot;Behistun Inscription&quot;. Despite its relative inaccessibility, Rawlinson was able to scale the cliff and copy the Old Persian inscription. The Elamite was across a chasm, and the Babylonian four meters above; both were beyond easy reach and were left for later.

With the Persian text, and with about a third of the [[syllabary]] made available to him by the work of [[Georg Friedrich Grotefend]], Rawlinson set to work on deciphering the text. Fortunately, the first section of this text contained a list of the same Persian kings found in [[Herodotus]] in their original Persian forms as opposed to Herodotus's Greek [[transliteration]]s; for example Darius is given as the original ''Dâryavuš'' instead of the Hellenized ''Δαρειος''. By matching the names and the characters, Rawlinson was able to decipher the type of cuneiform used for Old Persian by 1838 and presented his results to the [[Royal Asiatic Society]] in [[London]] and the [[Société Asiatique]] in [[Paris]].

In the interim, Rawlinson spent a brief tour of duty in [[Afghanistan]], returning to the site in 1843. He first crossed a chasm between the Persian and Elamite scripts by bridging the gap with planks, subsequently copying the Elamite inscription. He was then able to find an enterprising local boy to climb up a crack in the cliff and suspend ropes across the Babylonian writing, so that [[papier-mâché]] casts of the inscriptions could be taken. Rawlinson, along with scholars [[Edward Hincks]], [[Julius Oppert]], [[William Henry Fox Talbot]], and [[Edwin Norris]], either working separately or in collaboration, eventually deciphered these inscriptions, leading eventually to the ability to read them completely.

The translation of the Old Persian sections of the Behistun Inscription paved the way to the subsequent ability to decipher the Elamite and Babylonian parts of the text, which greatly promoted the development of modern [[Assyriology]].

==Later research and activity==

Later expeditions, in 1904 sponsored by the [[British Museum]] and led by [[Leonard William King]] and [[Reginald Campbell Thompson]] and in 1948 by [[George G. Cameron]] of the [[University of Michigan]], obtained photographs, casts and more accurate transcriptions of the texts, including passages that were not copied by Rawlinson.  It also became apparent that rainwater had dissolved some areas of the limestone in which the text was inscribed, while leaving new deposits of limestone over other areas, covering the text.

In 1938, the inscription became of interest to the [[Nazi German]] [[think tank]] [[Ahnenerbe]], although research plans were cancelled due to the onset Word War II.

[[Image:BehistunInscriptiondetail.jpg|225px|thumb|right|Close-up of the inscription showing damage]]
The monument later suffered some damage from invading [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] soldiers using it for target practice during [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=&quot;chnpress1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chnpress.com/news/?section=2&amp;id=2589 |title=Documentation of Behistun Inscription Nearly Complete |publisher=Chnpress.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, Iranian archeologists began the documentation and assessment of damages to the site incurred during the 20th century.

In recent years, Iranian archaeologists have been undertaking conservation works.  The site became a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.payvand.com/news/06/jul/1130.html |title=Iran's Bisotoon Historical Site Registered in World Heritage List |publisher=Payvand.com |date=2006-07-13 |accessdate=2010-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other historical monuments in the Behistun complex==

The site covers an area of 116 hectares. Archeological evidence indicates that this region became a human shelter 40,000 years ago. There are 18 historical monuments other than the inscription of Darius the Great in the Behistun complex that have been registered in the Iranian national list of historical sites. Some of them are:

&lt;/gallery&gt;
In the first image, [[Herakles]] with curly hair and a beard rests on the lion skin. Beside him, an olive tree is seen carved on the wall, while a quiver full of arrows is hanging from it, and a club resting close by. Behind the head of Herakles, an inscription of seven lines in old Greek is written on a smooth space with a frame similar to Greek temples. According to this inscription, the statue was carved in 139&amp;nbsp;BC on the occasion of a conquest for Seleucid Greeks (under [[Demetrius II Nicator]]) against the Parthians (under [[Mithridates I of Parthia]]), though the Seleucids were later defeated and driven from the region.

The second image is a [[bas relief]] of Mithridates II of Parthia: this was carved in 123–110&amp;nbsp;BC and represents Parthian king Mithridates and four of his satraps who are respecting the king. ''Bas relief of Gotarzes II of Parthia'' shows the conquest of that king over Meherdates, an [[Arsacid Empire|Arsacid]] prince who lived in [[Rome]]. An inscription in Greek is seen on the left side of the top outer frame of the relief. ''Sheikh Ali khan Zangeneh text endowment'': According to this text, written in Sloth calligraphy, Sheikh Ali khan Zangeneh, a local ruler of the 17th century, dedicates four shares (out of six) of his properties in Ghareh-vali and Chambatan (local villages) for Sadaats (descendants of the prophet Mohammad), and two remaining shares for the Bisotoun Safavid caravansarai.

&lt;!-- Note that many sources erroneously give his birthdate as January 1. See http://www.accuracyproject.org/cbe-Goldwater,Barry.html for discussion. --&gt;
'''Barry Morris Goldwater''' (January 2, 1909&lt;ref&gt;Internet Accuracy Project, [http://www.accuracyproject.org/cbe-Goldwater,Barry.html Senator Barry Goldwater]. Retrieved September 23, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; – May 29, 1998) was a five-term [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] from [[Arizona]] (1953–1965, 1969–1987) and the [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republican Party]]'s nominee for [[President of the United States|President]] in the [[United States presidential election, 1964|1964 election]]. An articulate and charismatic figure during the first half of the [[1960s]], he was known as &quot;Mr. Conservative&quot;.

Goldwater is the politician most often credited for sparking the resurgence of the [[Conservatism in the United States|American conservative]] political movement in the 1960s. He also had a substantial impact on the [[libertarianism|libertarian movement]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Poole, [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1568/is_n4_v30/ai_20954419 In memoriam: Barry Goldwater – Obituary], [[Reason Magazine]], August–Sept, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

Goldwater rejected the legacy of the [[New Deal]] and fought through the [[conservative coalition]] to defeat the [[New Deal coalition]]. He mobilized a large [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] constituency to win the hard-fought Republican primaries. Goldwater's [[right-wing politics|right-wing]] campaign platform ultimately failed to gain the support of the electorate &lt;ref&gt;Theodore H. White, ''The Making of the President in 1964'' (1965) p. 217&lt;/ref&gt; and he lost the 1964 presidential election to incumbent [[History of the United States Democratic Party|Democrat]] [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] by one of the largest landslides in history, bringing down many Republican candidates as well. The Johnson campaign and other critics painted him as a [[reactionary]], while supporters praised his crusades against the [[Soviet Union]], [[labor union]]s, and the [[welfare state]]. His defeat allowed Johnson and the Democrats in Congress to pass the [[Great Society]] programs, but the defeat of so many older Republicans in 1964 also cleared the way for a younger generation of American conservatives to mobilize. Goldwater was much less active as a national leader of conservatives after 1964; his supporters mostly rallied behind [[Ronald Reagan]], who became governor of [[California]] in 1967 and the 40th [[President of the United States]] in 1981.

Goldwater returned to the Senate in 1969, and specialized in defense policy, bringing to the table his experience as a senior officer in the [[Air Force Reserve]]. His greatest accomplishment was arguably the passage of the [[Goldwater-Nichols Act]] of 1986, which restructured the higher levels of the [[United States Department of Defense|Pentagon]] by increasing the power of the [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]] to direct military action. In 1974, as an elder statesman of the party, Goldwater successfully urged President [[Richard Nixon]] to resign when evidence of a cover-up in the [[Watergate scandal]] became overwhelming and impeachment was imminent. By the 1980s, the increasing influence of the [[Christian right]] on the [[Factions in the Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] so conflicted with Goldwater's [[libertarian]] views that he became a vocal opponent of the religious right on issues such as [[LGBT rights in the United States|gay rights]] and the role of religion in public life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.campusprogress.org/soundvision/1176/progressives-meet-goldwater?type=printer |title=Progressives, Meet Goldwater |accessdate=2008-08-03|last=Goldstein |first=Dana|date=2006-09-21|publisher=CampusProgress.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Goldwater was born in [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], in what was then the [[Arizona Territory]], the son of Baron Goldwater and his wife, Hattie Josephine (&quot;JoJo&quot;) Williams. His father's [[Jewish American]] family had founded [[Goldwater's]], the largest [[department store]] in Phoenix. The family name had been changed from ''Goldwasser'' to ''Goldwater'' at least as early as the 1860 census in [[Los Angeles, California]]. Goldwater's paternal grandparents, Michel and Sarah (Nathan) Goldwasser, had been married in the [[Great Synagogue of London]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1284836.html Thoroughly modern grandmothers]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/books/chap1/barrygoldwater.htm | work=The Washington Post | date=May 13, 1997 | accessdate=March 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goldwater's mother came from an old [[Yankee]] family that included the famous theologian, [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger Williams]] of [[Rhode Island]].&lt;ref&gt;Goldberg, ''Barry Goldwater'' pp. 21&lt;/ref&gt; Goldwater's parents were married in an Episcopal church in Phoenix; for his entire life, Goldwater was an [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopalian]], though on rare occasions he referred to himself as &quot;Jewish&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/books/01/04/01/specials/goldwater-obit.html | work=The New York Times | accessdate=March 30, 2010 | title=Barry Goldwater, Conservative and Individualist, Dies at 89}}&lt;/ref&gt; While he did not often attend church, he stated that &quot;If a man acts in a religious way, an ethical way, then he's really a religious man—and it doesn't have a lot to do with how often he gets inside a church&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,876116,00.html Worship: Goldwater's Faith]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goldberg, ''Barry Goldwater'' pp. 22–27, quote p. 27. The Jewish essayist [[Harry Golden]] famously remarked of Goldwater, &quot;I have always thought that if a Jew ever became President, he would turn out to be an Episcopalian.&quot;&quot;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,898063,00.html &quot;The Taboo&quot;] ''Time Magazine.'' 22 November 1963.&lt;/ref&gt;

The family department store made the Goldwaters comfortably wealthy. Goldwater graduated from [[Staunton Military Academy]], an elite private school in Virginia, and attended the [[University of Arizona]] for one year, where he joined the [[Sigma Chi]] fraternity. Barry had never been close to his father, but he took over the family business after Baron's death in 1930. He became a Republican (in a heavily Democratic state), promoted innovative business practices, and opposed the [[New Deal]], especially because it fostered labor unions. Goldwater came to know former president [[Herbert Hoover]], whose conservative politics he admired greatly. In 1934, he married Margaret &quot;Peggy&quot; Johnson, wealthy daughter of a prominent industrialist from [[Muncie, Indiana|Muncie]], Indiana. They had four children: Joanne (born January 1, 1936), [[Barry Goldwater, Jr.|Barry]] (born July 15, 1938), Michael (born March 15, 1940), and Peggy (born July 27, 1944). Barry became a widower in 1985, and in 1992 he married Susan Wechsler, a nurse 32 years his junior.&lt;ref&gt;Goldberg, ''Barry Goldwater'' pp. 41–42, 48–49, 326, 332&lt;/ref&gt;

With the American entry into [[World War II]], Goldwater received a reserve commission in the [[United States Army Air Forces]]. He became a pilot assigned to the Ferry Command, a newly formed unit that flew aircraft and supplies to war zones worldwide. He spent most of the war flying between the USA and [[India]], via the [[Azores]] and North Africa or [[South America]], [[Nigeria]], and Central Africa. He also flew &quot;the hump&quot; over the [[Himalayas]] to deliver supplies to the [[Republic of China]]. Remaining in the [[Air Force Reserve]] after the war, he eventually retired as a [[Command Pilot|command pilot]] with the rank of [[Major general (United States)|Major General]]. By that time, he had flown 165 different types of aircraft. Following World War II, Goldwater was a leading proponent of creating the [[United States Air Force Academy]], and later served on the Academy's Board of Visitors. The Visitor Center at the USAF Academy is now named in his honor. As a Colonel he also founded the [[Arizona Air National Guard]], and he would [[desegregate]] it two years before the rest of the US military. Goldwater was instrumental in pushing the Pentagon to support desegregation of the armed services.&lt;ref&gt;http://books.google.com/books?id=-EgEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA93&amp;lpg=PA93&amp;dq=goldwater+and+the+desegregation+of+the+arizona+air+national+guard&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ZpoJA8bHRB&amp;sig=JI8LrknD0ER1FQqg-Q7HQZim7hM&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=2sYsTci4JIG8lQeP1sywCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=goldwater%20and%20the%20desegregation%20of%20the%20arizona%20air%20national%20guard&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1940, Goldwater became one of the first people to run the [[Colorado River]] recreationally through [[Grand Canyon]] when he participated as an oarsman on [[Norman Nevills|Norman Nevills']] second commercial river trip. Goldwater joined the trip in [[Green River, UT|Green River, Utah]] and rowed his own boat down to [[Lake Mead]].&lt;ref&gt;Lavender, David ''River Runners of the Grand Canyon'' ISBN 0-8165-0940-9&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970, the Arizona Historical Foundation published the daily journal that Goldwater maintained on the Grand Canyon trip, along with the photographs he took, in a 209 page volume titled &quot;Delightful Journey&quot; by Barry Goldwater.

Goldwater's son [[Barry Goldwater, Jr.]] served as a [[United States House of Representatives]] member from [[California]] from 1969 to 1983.

==Political career==
Goldwater entered Phoenix politics in [[1949]] when he was elected to the City Council as part of a nonpartisan group of candidates who focused on &quot;cleaning up&quot; widespread prostitution and gambling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/daily/may98/goldwaterchrono.htm | work=The Washington Post | date=June 5, 1998 | accessdate=March 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a Republican he won a seat in the [[United States Senate|US Senate]] in [[U.S. Senate election, 1952|1952]], when he upset veteran Democrat and Senate majority leader [[Ernest McFarland]]. He defeated McFarland again in [[United States Senate elections, 1958|1958]], with a strong showing in his first reelection in a year in which the Democrats picked up 13 seats in the Senate. He stepped down from the Senate in 1964 for his presidential campaign.

===Policies===
Goldwater soon became most associated with labor-union reform and anti-communism; he was an active supporter of the [[conservative coalition]] in Congress. However, he rejected the wilder fringes of the [[Anti-communism|anti-communist movement]]; in 1956 he sponsored the passage through the Senate of the final version of the [[Alaska Mental Health Enabling Act]], despite vociferous opposition from opponents who claimed that the Act was a communist plot to establish concentration camps in [[Alaska]]. His work on labor issues led to Congress passing major anti-corruption reforms in 1957, and an all-out campaign by the [[AFL-CIO]] to defeat his 1958 reelection bid. He voted against the censure of Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]] in 1954, but he was much more prudent than McCarthy and never actually charged any individual with being a communist/Soviet agent. Goldwater emphasized his strong opposition to the worldwide spread of communism in his 1960 book ''[[Conscience of a Conservative|The Conscience of a Conservative]]''. The book became an important reference text in conservative political circles.

In 1964, Goldwater ran a conservative campaign that emphasized &quot;states' rights.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Gary Donaldson, ''Liberalism's last hurrah: the presidential campaign of 1964'' (2003) p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; Goldwater's 1964 campaign was a magnet for conservatives since he opposed interference by the federal government in state affairs. Although he had supported all previous federal civil rights legislation and had supported the original senate version of the bill, Goldwater made the decision to oppose the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]]. His stance was based on his view that the act was an intrusion of the federal government into the affairs of states and, second, that the Act interfered with the rights of private persons to do business, or not, with whomever they chose.&lt;ref&gt;Donaldson, ''Liberalism's last hurrah: the presidential campaign of 1964'' (2003) pp 152–79&lt;/ref&gt;

All this appealed to white Southern Democrats, and Goldwater was the first Republican to win the electoral votes of the Deep South states ([[Louisiana]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Alabama]], [[Mississippi]], and [[South Carolina]]) since [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]]. However, Goldwater's vote on the Civil Rights Act proved devastating to his campaign everywhere outside the South (besides Dixie, Goldwater won only in Arizona, his home state), contributing to his landslide defeat in 1964. A [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] ad, called &quot;Confessions of a Republican,&quot; which ran in the North, associated Goldwater with the [[Ku Klux Klan]]. At the same time, Johnson’s campaign in the Deep South emphasized Goldwater’s full history on and previous support for civil rights. In the end, Johnson swept the election.

While Goldwater had been depicted by his opponents in the Republican primaries as a representative of a [[conservatism|conservative philosophy]] that was extreme and alien, his Congressional voting records show that his positions were in harmony with those of his fellow Republicans in the Congress. What distinguished him from his predecessors was, according to [[Hans J. Morgenthau]], his firmness of principle and determination, which did not allow him to be content with mere rhetoric.&lt;ref&gt;Hans J. Morgenthau: &quot;Goldwater-The Romantic Regression&quot;, ''Commentary,'' September 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;

Goldwater fought in 1971 to stop U.S. funding of the [[United Nations]] after the [[People's Republic of China]] was admitted to the organization. He said:
{{quote|I suggested on the floor of the Senate today that we stop all funds for the United Nations. Now, what that'll do to the United Nations, I don't know. I have a hunch it would cause them to fold up, which would make me very happy at this particular point. I think if this happens, they can well move their headquarters to Peking or Moscow and get 'em out of this country.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.upi.com/Audio/Year_in_Review/Events-of-1971/12295509436546-1/#title &quot;Red China Admitted to UN: 1971 Year in Review, UPI.com&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Elections===
In 1964, he fought and won a bitterly contested, multi-candidate race for the [[History of the Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]'s presidential nomination. His main rival was New York Governor [[Nelson Rockefeller]], whom he defeated by a narrow margin in the bitterly fought California primary. His nomination was opposed by liberal Republicans who thought Goldwater's demand for [[rollback]]--defeat of the [[Soviet Union]]--would foment a nuclear war. Goldwater [[United States presidential election, 1964|lost to President Lyndon Johnson]] by a massive landslide, pulling down the GOP, which lost many seats in both houses of Congress. Goldwater carried only his home state and five Deep South states.

Goldwater remained popular in Arizona, and in the [[U.S. Senate election, 1968|1968 Senate election]] he was reelected (this time to the seat of retiring Senator [[Carl Hayden]]). He was subsequently reelected in 1974 and 1980. The [[United States Senate elections, 1974|1974]] election saw Goldwater easily reelected. His final campaign in 1980 was close, with Goldwater winning in a near draw against Democrat challenger Bill Schulz. Goldwater said later that the close result convinced him not to run again.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsuxC6Ft92I]&lt;/ref&gt;

Two self-published books advanced the Goldwater cause: ''[[A Choice, Not An Echo]]'' by [[Phyllis Schlafly]] and ''[[A Texan Looks at Lyndon: A Study in Illegitimate Power]]'' by the [[Texas]] [[historian]] [[J. Evetts Haley]]. Both were best-sellers but failed to bolster Goldwater's electoral prospects.

===Retirement===
Goldwater seriously considered retirement in [[U.S. Senate election, 1980|1980]] before deciding to run for reelection. Peggy Goldwater reportedly hoped that her husband's Senate term, due to end in January 1981, would be his last. Goldwater decided to run, planning to make the term his last in the Senate. Goldwater faced a surprisingly tough battle for reelection. He was viewed by some as out of touch and vulnerable for several reasons – most importantly, because he had planned to retire in 1981, Goldwater had not visited many areas of Arizona outside of Phoenix and Tucson. He was also challenged by a formidable opponent, Bill Schulz, who was a former Republican turned Democrat and a wealthy [[real estate]] developer. Schulz was able to infuse massive amounts of money into the campaign from his own fortune.

Arizona's changing population also hurt Goldwater. The state's population had soared, and a huge portion of the electorate had not lived in the state when Goldwater was previously elected, hence many voters were not familiar with Goldwater,{{dubious|date=November 2010}} who was on the defensive for much of the campaign. Early returns on election night seemed to indicate that Schulz would win. The counting of votes continued through the night and into the next morning. At around daybreak, Goldwater learned that he had been reelected thanks to [[absentee ballot|absentee]] votes, which were among the last to be counted.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Alan Goldberg, &quot;Barry Goldwater.&quot; (1995). chapter 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Goldwater's surprisingly close victory in 1980 came despite Reagan's 61% landslide over [[Jimmy Carter]] in Arizona. Republicans regained control of the Senate, putting Goldwater in the most powerful position he ever had in the Senate.

Goldwater retired in 1987, serving as chair of the Senate Intelligence and Armed Services Committees in his final term. Despite his reputation as a firebrand in the 1960s, by the end of his career he was considered a stabilizing influence in the Senate, one of the most respected members of either major party. Yet Goldwater remained staunchly anti-communist and &quot;hawkish&quot; on military issues. He led the unsuccessful fight against ratification of the [[Panama Canal Treaty]] in the 1970s, which would return control of the canal zone to the Republic of [[Panama]]. His most important legislative achievement may have been the [[Goldwater-Nichols Act]], which reorganized the U.S. military's senior-command structure.

===Political relationships===
Goldwater was grief-stricken{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} by the [[John F. Kennedy assassination|assassination of Kennedy]] and was greatly disappointed that his opponent in the race would not be JFK, but instead Kennedy's Vice President, the former Senate Majority Leader [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] of Texas.&lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot;&gt;[http://www.mrconservativegoldwaterongoldwater.com/], &quot;Mr. Conservative: Goldwater on Goldwater&quot;, HBO Documentary Films.&lt;/ref&gt; Goldwater disliked Johnson (whom he said &quot;used every dirty trick in the bag&quot;, and [[Richard M. Nixon]] of California, whom he later called &quot;the most dishonest individual I have ever met in my life.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot;/&gt;) Goldwater, by then again a Senator, advocated for Nixon to resign at the height of [[Watergate]], warning that fewer than ten senators would vote against conviction after Nixon was impeached by the House of Representatives.&lt;ref&gt;Goldberg, ''Barry Goldwater'' p 282&lt;/ref&gt; The term &quot;Goldwater moment&quot; has subsequently been used to describe situations when influential members of Congress disagree so strongly with a President from ''their own party'' that they rise up and take a stand against them.

His [[1984 Cable Franchise Policy and Communications Act]] allowed local governments to require the transmission of [[Public, educational, and government access]] (PEG) channels, barred cable operators from exercising editorial control over content of programs carried on PEG channels, and absolved them from liability for their content.

====U.S. presidential campaign, 1964====

[[File:1964RepublicanPresidentialPrimaries.gif|thumb|200px|Republican primaries results]]
At the time of Goldwater's presidential candidacy, the Republican Party was split between its conservative wing (based in the West and South) and moderate/liberal wing (based in the Northeast). He alarmed even some of his fellow partisans with his brand of staunch [[Fiscal conservatives|fiscal conservatism]] and militant [[anti-communism]]. He was viewed by many traditional Republicans as being too far on the [[right wing]] of the political spectrum to appeal to the mainstream majority necessary to win a national election. As a result, moderate Republicans recruited a series of opponents, including [[New York]] Governor [[Nelson Rockefeller]], [[Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr.]], of [[Massachusetts]] and [[Pennsylvania]] Governor [[William Scranton]], to challenge Goldwater. Goldwater would defeat Rockefeller in the winner-take-all California primary and secure the nomination. He also had a solid backing from Southern Republicans. A bright young [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]] lawyer, [[John Grenier]], secured commitments from 271 of 279 southern convention delegates to back Goldwater. Grenier went on to serve as executive director of the national GOP during the Goldwater campaign. This was the Number 2 position to party chairman [[Dean Burch]], Goldwater's fellow Arizonan.

Goldwater famously declared in his bold acceptance speech at the 1964 Republican Convention: &quot;I would remind you that extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice. And let me remind you also that moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue.&quot; This paraphrase of [[Cicero]] was included at the suggestion of [[Harry V. Jaffa]], though the speech was primarily written by [[Karl Hess]]. Due to President Johnson's popularity, however, Goldwater held back from attacking the president directly; he did not even mention Johnson by name in his convention speech.

Past comments came back to haunt Goldwater throughout his campaign. Once he called the [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]] administration &quot;a dime-store [[New Deal]],&quot; and the former president never fully forgave him. Eisenhower did, however, film a TV commercial with Goldwater.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livingroomcandidate.org/commercials/1964/ike-at-gettysburg &quot;Ike at Gettysburg&quot;], Goldwater campaign ad&lt;/ref&gt; Eisenhower qualified his voting for Goldwater in November by remarking that he had voted not specifically for Goldwater, but for the Republican Party.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} In December 1961, Goldwater told a news conference that &quot;sometimes I think this country would be better off if we could just saw off the Eastern Seaboard and let it float out to sea&quot;. That comment boomeranged on him during the campaign in the form of a Johnson television commercial,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livingroomcandidate.org/commercials/1964/eastern-seabord &quot;Eastern Seabord&quot;], Johnson campaign ad&lt;/ref&gt; as did remarks about making [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] voluntary,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livingroomcandidate.org/commercials/1964/social-security &quot;Social Security&quot;], Johnson campaign ad&lt;/ref&gt; and statements in Tennessee about selling the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]], a large local New Deal employer.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

The Goldwater campaign spotlighted [[Ronald Reagan]], who appeared in a campaign ad&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livingroomcandidate.org/commercials/1964/ronald-reagan Goldwater ad]&lt;/ref&gt; and gave a stirring, nationally televised speech, &quot;[[A Time for Choosing]]&quot;, in support of Goldwater.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Reagan, [http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/ronaldreaganatimeforchoosing.htm ''A Time for Choosing''], Televised Address on Behalf of Barry Goldwater, Delivered October 27, 1964, Los Angeles, CA.&lt;/ref&gt; The speech prompted Reagan to seek the [[Governor of California|California Governorship]] in 1966 and jump-started his political career. Conservative activist [[Phyllis Schlafly]], later well-known for her fight against the [[Equal Rights Amendment]], first became known for writing a pro-Goldwater book, ''A Choice, Not an Echo,'' attacking the moderate Republican establishment. Senator [[Prescott Bush]] (1895–1972), a moderate Republican from Connecticut, was a friend of Goldwater's and supported him in the general election campaign. Bush's son, [[George H. W.|George H.W. Bush]] (then running for the Senate from Texas against Democrat [[Ralph Yarborough]]), was also a strong Goldwater supporter in both the nomination and general election campaigns. Future Chief Justice of the Supreme Court and fellow Arizonan [[William Rehnquist]] also first came to the attention of national Republicans through his work as a legal adviser to Goldwater's 1964 campaign. Goldwater was painted as a dangerous figure by the Johnson campaign, which countered Goldwater's slogan &quot;In your heart, you know he's right&quot; with the lines &quot;In your guts, you know he's nuts,&quot; and &quot;In your heart, you know he might&quot; (that is, might actually use nuclear weapons, as opposed to merely subscribing to [[Deterrence theory|deterrence]]). Johnson himself did not mention Goldwater in his own acceptance speech at the [[1964 Democratic National Convention]].

Goldwater's provocative advocacy of aggressive tactics to prevent the spread of communism in Asia led to effective counterattacks from [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] and his supporters, who claimed that Goldwater's militancy would have dire consequences, possibly even nuclear war. Regarding Vietnam, Goldwater charged that Johnson's policy was devoid of &quot;goal, course, or purpose,&quot; leaving &quot;only sudden death in the jungles and the slow strangulation of freedom.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Matthews 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Goldwater's own rhetoric on nuclear war was viewed by many as quite uncompromising, a view buttressed by off-hand comments such as, &quot;Let's lob one into the men's room at the [[Moscow Kremlin|Kremlin]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Harper's Magazine |work=Tentacles of Rage |url=http://www.mindfully.org/Reform/2004/Republican-Propaganda1sep04.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Goldwater did his best to counter the Johnson attacks, criticizing the Johnson administration for its perceived ethical lapses, and stating in a commercial that &quot;…we, as a nation, are not far from the kind of moral decay that has brought on the fall of other nations and people…I say it is time to put conscience back in government. And by good example, put it back in all walks of American life.&quot; Goldwater campaign commercials included statements of support by actor [[Raymond Massey]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livingroomcandidate.org/commercials/1964/raymond-massey Goldwater ad]&lt;/ref&gt; and moderate Republican senator [[Margaret Chase Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livingroomcandidate.org/commercials/1964/senator-margaret-chase Goldwater ad]&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the 1964 election, the muckraking [[Fact magazine]], published by [[Ralph Ginzburg]], ran a special issue entitled ‘The Unconscious of a Conservative: A Special Issue on the Mind of Barry Goldwater.’ The two main articles contended that Goldwater was mentally unfit to be president. The magazine attempted to support this claim with the results of an unscientific poll of psychiatrists it had conducted. ''Fact'' had mailed questionnaires to 12,356 psychiatrists, and published a ‘sampling’ of the comments made by the 2,417 psychiatrists who responded, of which 1,189 said Goldwater was unfit to be president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=[[Richard A.

Ginzburg]]. &quot;Although the jury awarded Goldwater only $1.00 in compensatory damages against all three defendants, it went on to [396 U.S. 1049, 1050] award him punitive damages of $25,000 against Ginzburg and $50,000 against ''Fact'' magazine, Inc.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=396&amp;invol=1049 Ginzburg v.

=====Daisy=====
A Democratic campaign advertisement known as [[Daisy (advertisement)|Daisy]] showed a young girl counting daisy petals, from one to ten. Immediately following this scene, a voiceover counted down from ten to one. The child's face was shown as a still photograph followed by images of [[Effects of nuclear explosions|nuclear explosions]] and [[mushroom cloud]]s. The campaign advertisement ended with a plea to vote for Johnson, implying that Goldwater (who was not mentioned by name) would provoke a [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]] if elected. The advertisement, which featured only a few spoken words of narrative and relied on imagery for its emotional impact, was one of the most provocative in American political campaign history, and many analysts credit it as being the birth of the modern style of &quot;[[Negative campaigning|negative political ads]]&quot; on television. The ad only aired once, and was immediately pulled, but then was shown numerous times by television stations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livingroomcandidate.org/commercials/1964/peace-little-girl-daisy &quot;Daisy&quot; ad]&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Results=====
[[File:ElectoralCollege1964.svg|thumb|right|300px|Goldwater only won his home state of Arizona and five states in the [[Deep South]], depicted in red. The Southern states, traditionally Democratic up to that time, voted Republican primarily as a statement of opposition to the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|Civil Rights Act]], which had been passed by Johnson and the Democrats in Congress earlier that year.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} Capturing 61.1% of the popular vote and 486 electors, Johnson won in a landslide.]]

In the end, Goldwater received 38.4% of the popular vote, and carried six states: Arizona (with only 50.45% of the popular vote) and the core states of the [[Deep South]]: Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, and South Carolina, where for the last time the electorate was practically all white. In all, Johnson won an overwhelming 486 electoral votes, to Goldwater's 52. Goldwater, with his customary bluntness, remarked: &quot;We would have lost even if Abraham Lincoln had come back and campaigned with us.&quot; He maintained later in life that he would have won the election if the country had not been in a state of extended grief (referring to the assassination of [[John F. Kennedy]]), and that it was simply not ready for a third President in just 14 months.

Goldwater's poor showing pulled down many supporters. Of the 57 Republican Congressmen who endorsed Goldwater before the convention, 20 were defeated for reelection, along with many promising young Republicans. On the other hand, the defeat of so many older politicians created openings for young conservatives to move up the ladder. While the loss of moderate Republicans was temporary—they were back by 1966—Goldwater also permanently pulled many conservative Southerners and white ethnics out of the [[New Deal Coalition]].&lt;ref&gt;Goldberg, ''Barry Goldwater'' 232-37&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;In the South, Goldwater broke through and won five states—the best showing in the region for a GOP candidate since Reconstruction. In [[Mississippi]]—where [[FDR]] had won nearly 100 percent of the vote just 28 years earlier—Goldwater claimed a staggering 87 percent.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Kornacki, Steve (2011-02-03) [http://www.salon.com/news/politics/war_room/2011/02/03/reagan_southern_strategy/index.html The &quot;Southern Strategy,&quot; fulfilled], ''[[Salon.com]]''&lt;/ref&gt; It has frequently been argued that Goldwater's strong performance in Southern states previously regarded as Democratic strongholds foreshadowed a larger shift in electoral trends in the coming decades that would make the south a Republican bastion (an end to the &quot;[[Solid South]]&quot;)—first in presidential politics and eventually at the congressional and state levels, as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Daniel |last=Rodriguez |coauthors=Weingast, Barry |title=How the GOP Helped the Democrats Destroy the Solid South |date=July, 2006 |publisher= |url=http://politicalscience.stanford.edu/faculty/documents/weingast-untold%20story%20of%201964%20civil%20rights%20act.pdf |work=Stanford University |pages= |accessdate = 2007-01-07 |language =|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Goldwater and the revival of American conservatism===
Although Goldwater was not as important in the [[Conservatism in the United States|American conservative]] movement as [[Ronald Reagan]] after 1965, he shaped and redefined the movement from the late 1950s to 1964. Arizona Senator [[John McCain]] summed up Goldwater's legacy thus: &quot;He transformed the Republican Party from an Eastern elitist organization to the breeding ground for the election of Ronald Reagan.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Grove | first = Lloyd | title = Barry Goldwater's Left Turn | publisher = Washington Post | date = 1994-07-28 | url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/daily/may98/goldwater072894.htm | accessdate = 2008-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The columnist [[George Will]] remarked after the [[United States presidential election, 1980|1980 Presidential election]] that it took 16 years to count the votes from 1964 and Goldwater won.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/11/05/AR2008110503927.html Will, November 6, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Republican Party recovered from the 1964 election debacle, picking up 47 seats in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] in the [[U.S. House election, 1966|mid-term election of 1966]]. Further Republican successes ensued, including Goldwater's return to the Senate in 1968. In January of that year, Goldwater wrote an article in the ''[[National Review]]'' &quot;affirming that he [was] not against liberals, that liberals are needed as a counterweight to conservatism, and that he had in mind a fine liberal like [[Max Lerner]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Murray Rothbard|Rothbard, Murray N.]]. [http://www.mises.org/story/1842 Confessions of a Right-Wing Liberal], ''[[Ludwig von Mises Institute]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the 1970s, as the conservative wing under Reagan gained control of the party, Goldwater concentrated on his Senate duties, especially in military affairs. He played little part in the election or administration of [[Richard Nixon]], but he helped force Nixon's resignation in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/printout/0,8816,942972,00.html &quot;The Unmaking of the President, ''Time'' August 19, 1974 online at]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976 he helped block Rockefeller's renomination as Vice President. When Reagan challenged Ford for the presidential nomination in 1976, Goldwater endorsed Ford, looking for consensus rather than conservative idealism. As one historian notes, &quot;The Arizonan had lost much of his zest for battle.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Martin Kolkey, ''The New Right, 1960–1968: With Epilogue, 1969–1980.'' University Press of America. 1983. quote p. 254; Mary C. Brennan, ''Turning Right in the Sixties: The Conservative Capture of the GOP.'' U. of North Carolina Press. 1995. ch. 6; 1976 details in David W. Reinhard, ''The Republican Right since 1945.'' U. Press of Kentucky. 1983, p. 230.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, when President Carter normalized relations with [[People's Republic of China|Communist China]], Goldwater and some other senators sued him in the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]], arguing that the president could not terminate the [[Sino-American Mutual Defense Treaty]] with [[Republic of China]] ([[Taiwan]]) without the approval of [[Congress of the United States|Congress]]. The case was known as ''[[Goldwater v. Carter]]'', which was dismissed by the court as a [[political question]].

===Later life===
[[File:Goldwater1983.jpg|Signing autographs at the Fiesta Bowl parade in 1983.|thumb|250px|right]]
By the 1980s, with [[Ronald Reagan]] as president and the growing involvement of the [[Christian right|religious right]] in conservative politics, Goldwater's [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] views on personal issues were revealed; he believed that they were an integral part of true conservatism. Goldwater viewed [[abortion]] as a matter of personal choice, not intended for government intervention.&lt;ref&gt;Goldberg, ''Barry Goldwater,'' p. 331&lt;/ref&gt;

As a passionate defender of personal liberty, he saw the religious right's views as an encroachment on personal privacy and [[Civil liberties|individual liberties]].&lt;ref&gt;Goldberg, ''Barry Goldwater,'' p. 315&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1980 Senate reelection campaign, Goldwater won support from [[religious conservative]]s but in his final term voted consistently to uphold legalized abortion and, in 1981, gave a speech on how he was angry about the bullying of American politicians by religious organizations, and would &quot;fight them every step of the way&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pieceofmind.wordpress.com/2006/11/10/wwbd-what-would-barry-do/ Goldwater on personal religious views] The quotation comes from a piece Goldwater wrote for the Los Angeles Times on September 17, 1981, &quot;The 'New Right' Has Nothing to Do with the 'Old Conservatism'.&quot; It is also quoted on p. 39 of [[The God Delusion]]&lt;/ref&gt; Goldwater also disagreed with the Reagan administration on certain aspects of foreign policy (for example, he opposed the decision to mine Nicaraguan harbors). Notwithstanding his prior differences with [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], Goldwater in a 1986 interview rated him the best of the seven Presidents with whom he had worked.

On May 12, 1986, Goldwater was presented with the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] by President [[Ronald Reagan]].

After his retirement in 1987, Goldwater described the Arizona Governor [[Evan Mecham]] as &quot;hardheaded&quot; and called on him to resign, and two years later stated that the Republican party had been taken over by a &quot;bunch of kooks&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Goldberg, ''Barry Goldwater,'' p. 329.&lt;/ref&gt;
In a 1994 interview with the ''[[Washington Post]]'' the retired senator said, {{quote|When you say &quot;radical right&quot; today, I think of these moneymaking ventures by fellows like [[Pat Robertson]] and others who are trying to take the Republican party and make a religious organization out of it.

Goldwater visited the small town of Bowen, Illinois in 1989 to see first hand where his mother was raised.

In response to [[Moral Majority]] founder [[Jerry Falwell]]'s opposition to the nomination of [[Sandra Day O'Connor]] to the Supreme Court, of which Falwell had said, &quot;Every good Christian should be concerned&quot;, Goldwater retorted: &quot;Every good Christian ought to kick Falwell right in the ass.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ed Magnuson, [[Time Magazine]], [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,954833-2,00.html ''The Brethren's First Sister''], July 20, 1981.

Journalist [[Robert MacNeil]], a friend of Goldwater's from the 1964 Presidential campaign, recalled interviewing him in his office shortly afterward. &quot;He was sitting in his office with his hands on his cane&amp;nbsp;... and he said to me, 'Well, aren't you going to ask me about the [[Iran]] arms sales?'

Some of Goldwater's statements in the 1990s aggravated many [[social conservatives]]. He endorsed Democrat [[Karan English]] in an Arizona congressional race, urged Republicans to lay off [[Bill Clinton]] over the [[Whitewater scandal]], and criticized the military's ban on [[homosexuality|homosexuals]]:&lt;ref name=&quot;left_turn&quot;/&gt; &quot;Everyone knows that gays have served honorably in the military since at least the time of [[Julius Caesar]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Ban On Gays Is Senseless Attempt To Stall The Inevitable&quot;, ''Los Angeles Times'', ''Washington Post''.

Can you imagine that?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.azcentral.com/specials/special25/articles/0531goldwater2.html&lt;/ref&gt; In that same year, with Senator [[Dennis DeConcini]], Goldwater endorsed an [[Arizona]] initiative to legalize [[medical marijuana]] against the countervailing opinion of social conservatives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reason.com/news/show/30148.html Prescription: Drugs] Reason Magazine&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
Goldwater was known in Las Vegas as a “swinger”, or someone who enjoyed the casinos of Las Vegas and the plush suites in clubs such as the Flamingo and the Riviera.&lt;ref&gt;Reid, Ed, and Ovid Demaris. 1963. The Green Felt Jungle. Buccaneer Books, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; He had personal and financial relationships with two racketeers – [[Willie Bioff]] and [[Gus Greenbaum]] – both of whom were later murdered in gangland executions. Bioff gained control of Hollywood labor unions in the 1930s. In 1941, Bioff was indicted for violating the federal anti-racketeering statutes, and was later convicted of extortion in connection with his management of those unions. Bioff turned state’s witness and assisted in the prosecution of nine Chicago Mafia partners. Greenbaum was a Las Vegas casino operator for various Mafia interests.&lt;ref name=reid&gt;Reid, Ed, and Ovid Demaris. 1963. The Green Felt Jungle. Buccaneer Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

When Goldwater began his relationship with Bioff, Bioff was already a convicted labor extortionist. Goldwater said of Bioff at various times that he either did not know of Bioff’s criminal history, or that he was associating with Bioff in order to learn more about labor racketeering. In 1952, Goldwater convinced a local newspaper not to publish a story about Bioff’s criminal history. Goldwater promptly received a $5,000 contribution from Bioff.&lt;ref&gt;Reid, Ed, and Ovid Demaris. 1963. The Green Felt Jungle. Buccaneer Books, pp. 201–206.&lt;/ref&gt; Goldwater flew Bioff to parties all over the Southwest in his private plane.&lt;ref&gt;Reid, Ed, and Ovid Demaris. 1963. The Green Felt Jungle. Buccaneer Books, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 17, 1963, Goldwater held a press conference in Pittsburgh in which he denounced news reports of his gangland associations.

==Hobbies and interests==
===Amateur radio===
Goldwater was an avid [[amateur radio]] operator from the early 1920s onwards, with the [[call sign]]s 6BPI, K3UIG and K7UGA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smecc.org/barry_goldwater.htm An Afternoon with Senator Goldwater ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://wireless2.fcc.gov/UlsApp/UlsSearch/license.jsp?licKey=262314 FCC K7UGA record]&lt;/ref&gt; The latter is now used by an Arizona club honoring him as a commemorative call. During the [[Vietnam War]], he spent many hours giving servicemen overseas the ability to talk to their families at home over the [[Military Affiliate Radio System]] (MARS).

Goldwater was also a prominent spokesman for amateur radio and its enthusiasts. Beginning in 1969 up to his death he appeared in numerous educational and promotional films (and later videos) about the hobby that were produced for the [[American Radio Relay League]] (the United States national society representing the interests of radio amateurs) by such producers as Dave Bell (W6AQ), ARRL Southwest Director John R. Griggs (W6KW), Alan Kaul (W6RCL), Forrest Oden (N6ENV), Bill Pasternak (WA6ITF) and the late Roy Neal (K6DUE). His first appearance was in Dave Bell's &quot;The World of Amateur Radio&quot; where Goldwater discussed the history of the hobby and demonstrated a live contact with Antarctica. His last on-screen appearance dealing with &quot;ham radio&quot; was in 1994, explaining a then-upcoming, Earth-orbiting ham radio relay satellite.

Electronics were a hobby for Goldwater beyond amateur radio. He enjoyed assembling [[Heathkit]]s, completing more than 100 and often visiting their maker in [[Benton Harbor, Michigan]] to buy more, before the company exited the kit business in 1992.&lt;ref name=&quot;fisher&quot;&gt;Fisher, Lawrence M. &quot;[http://www.nytimes.com/1992/03/30/business/plug-is-pulled-on-heathkits-ending-a-do-it-yourself-era.html Plug Is Pulled on Heathkits, Ending a Do-It-Yourself Era]&quot; ''The New York Times'', 30 March 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kachina dolls===
[[File:Kachina Dolls Heard Museum.jpg|thumb|right|Over half of the kachina dolls at the Heard Museum were donated by Goldwater]]
In 1916, Goldwater visited the [[Hopi]] [[Indian Reservation|Reservation]] with Phoenix architect John Rinker Kibby, and obtained his first [[Hopi Kachina dolls|kachina doll]]. Eventually his doll collection included 437 items, presented in 1969 to the [[Heard Museum]] in Phoenix.&lt;ref name=&quot;kachina&quot;&gt;[http://www.azcentral.com/specials/special25/articles/1203goldwater2.html Goldwater Kachinas a public treasure]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Photography===
Goldwater was an accomplished amateur [[photographer]] and in his estate left some 15,000 of his images to three Arizona institutions. He was very keen on [[candid photography]]. He got started in photography after receiving a camera as a gift from his wife on their first Christmas together. He was known to use a [[Large format|4x5]] [[Graflex]], [[Rolleiflex]] camera, and [[Nikon]] [[135 film|35 mm]].

For decades, he contributed photographs of his home state to ''[[Arizona Highways (magazine)|Arizona Highways]]'' and was best known for his Western landscapes and pictures of [[native Americans in the United States]]. Three books with his photographs are ''People and Places'', from 1967; ''Barry Goldwater and the Southwest'', from 1976; and ''Delightful Journey'', first published in 1940 and reprinted in 1970. [[Ansel Adams]] wrote a foreword to the 1976 book.&lt;ref&gt;''Arizona Republic'', May 31, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

Goldwater's photography interests occasionally crossed over with his political career, as well. [[John Kennedy]], as president, was known to invite former congressional colleagues to the White House for a drink. On one occasion, Goldwater brought his camera and photographed President Kennedy. When Kennedy received the photo, he returned it to Goldwater, with the inscription, &quot;For Barry Goldwater – Whom I urge to follow the career for which he has shown such talent – photography! – from his friend – John Kennedy.&quot; This quip became a classic of American political humor after it was made famous by humorist [[Bennett Cerf]]. The photo itself was prized by Goldwater for the rest of his life, and recently sold for $17,925 in a [[Heritage Auctions|Heritage]] auction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://historical.ha.com/common/view_item.php?Sale_No=6047&amp;Lot_No=47197 Heritage Auctions description of signed Kennedy photo]&lt;/ref&gt;

Son Michael Prescott Goldwater formed the Goldwater Family Foundation with the goal of making his father's photography available via the internet. ([http://www.barrygoldwaterphotographs.com ''Barry Goldwater Photographs'']) was launched in September 2006 to coincide with the HBO documentary ''&quot;Mr. Conservative&quot;'', produced by granddaughter CC Goldwater.

===UFOs===
Goldwater was one of the more prominent American politicians to openly show an interest in [[UFO]]s.

On March 28, 1975, Goldwater wrote to Shlomo Arnon: &quot;The subject of UFOs has interested me for some long time. About ten or twelve years ago I made an effort to find out what was in the building at [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base]] where the information has been stored that has been collected by the Air Force, and I was understandably denied this request. It is still classified above [[Top Secret]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;anomalies.net&quot;/&gt; Goldwater further wrote that there were rumors the evidence would be released, and that he was &quot;just as anxious to see this material as you are, and I hope we will not have to wait much longer.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;anomalies.net&quot;&gt;[http://www.anomalies.net/archive/Text-Archive/txt1/469.ufo FOIA documents]&lt;/ref&gt;

The April 25, 1988 issue of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' carried an interview where Goldwater said he repeatedly asked his friend, Gen. [[Curtis LeMay]], if there was any truth to the rumors that UFO evidence was stored in a secret room at [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base]], and if he (Goldwater) might have access to the room. According to Goldwater, an angry LeMay gave him &quot;holy hell&quot; and said, &quot;Not only can't you get into it but don't you ever mention it to me again.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Burton Bernstein, ''Profiles'', &quot;AuH2O,&quot; ''The New Yorker'', April 25, 1988, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1988 interview on [[Larry King]]'s radio show, Goldwater was asked if he thought the U.S. Government was withholding UFO evidence; he replied &quot;Yes, I do.&quot; He added: {{quote|I certainly believe in aliens in space. They may not look like us, but I have very strong feelings that they have advanced beyond our mental capabilities....I think some highly secret government UFO investigations are going on that we don't know about&amp;nbsp;– and probably never will unless the Air Force discloses them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bibleufo.com/quotecong.htm UFO Quotations – The United States Congress]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Goldwater Scholarship==
The [[Barry M. Goldwater Scholarship]] and Excellence in Education Program was established by Congress in 1986. Its goal is to provide a continuing source of highly qualified scientists, mathematicians, and engineers by awarding scholarships to college students who intend to pursue careers in these fields.

The Scholarship is widely considered the most prestigious award in the U.S. conferred upon undergraduates studying the sciences. It is awarded to about 300 students (college sophomores and juniors) nationwide in the amount of $7500 per academic year (for their senior year, or junior and senior years). It honors Goldwater's keen interest in science and technology.

==Death==
Goldwater's public appearances ended in late 1996 after he suffered a massive stroke; family members then disclosed he was in the early stages of [[Alzheimer's disease]]. He died on May 29, 1998, at the age of 89 at his long-time home in [[Paradise Valley, Arizona]], of complications from the stroke.&lt;ref&gt;Biographical Directory of the United States Congress, [http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=G000267 ''Goldwater, Barry Morris, (1909–1998)'']. Retrieved 1/1/07.&lt;/ref&gt; His ashes were buried at the Episcopal Christ Church of the Ascension in Paradise Valley, Arizona. A memorial statue set in a small park has been erected to honor the memory of Goldwater in that town, near his former home and current resting place.

==Quotations==
{{Copy to Wikiquote|section=yes}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2010}}

&quot;I would remind you that extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice. And let me remind you also that moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue.&quot;

&quot;The income tax created more criminals than any other single act of government.&quot;

“To disagree, one doesn't have to be disagreeable.”

“Equality, rightly understood as our founding fathers understood it, leads to liberty and to the emancipation of creative differences; wrongly understood, as it has been so tragically in our time, it leads first to conformity and then to despotism.”

“We cannot allow the American flag to be shot at anywhere on earth if we are to retain our respect and prestige.”

“Remember that a government big enough to give you everything you want is also big enough to take away everything you have.”

“To insist on strength is not war-mongering. It is peace-mongering.”

“It’s time America realized that there is no gay exemption in the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness in the Declaration of Independence.”

&quot;You don't need to be straight to fight and die for your country. You just need to shoot straight.&quot;

The '''Baralong Incidents''' were naval engagements of the [[World War I|First World War]] in August and September 1915, involving the [[Royal Navy]] [[Q-Ship]] [[HMS Wyandra|HMS ''Wyandra'']], sailing under the name of ''Baralong'', and two [[German Empire|German]] [[U-boat]]s.

The ''Baralong'' sank ''U-27'', which had been preparing to sink a nearby merchant ship. About a dozen of the crewmen managed to escape the sinking submarine, and Lieutenant [[Godfrey Herbert]], commanding officer of the ''Baralong'', ordered the surviving sailors to be [[summarily executed]] after they boarded the ''Nicosian''. All the survivors of the ''U-27''{{'}}s sinking, including several who had reached the ''Nicosian'', were shot by the ''Baralong'''s crew. Later, ''Baralong'' sank [[SM U-41 (Germany)|''U-41'']] in an incident which has also been described as a [[war crime]].&lt;ref&gt; Alan Coles, ''Slaughter at Sea: The Truth Behind a Naval War Crime'', London : R. Hale, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Tony Bridgland, ''Sea Killers in Disguise: Q Ships and Decoy Raiders'', Leo Cooper, 1999. Chapter 4, &quot;The ''Baralong'': Germany is Outraged,&quot; pages 20-55.&lt;/ref&gt;

== First incident ==
=== Action of 19 August 1915 ===
After the sinking of the ''[[RMS Lusitania]]'' in May 1915, the [[Lieutenant-Commander]] [[Godfrey Herbert]] of the ''Baralong'' was visited by two officers of the Admiralty's Secret Service branch at the Naval base at [[Cobh|Queenstown, Ireland]]. He was told, &quot;This ''Lusitania'' business is shocking. Unofficially, we are telling you... take no prisoners from U-boats.&quot;&lt;ref&gt; Tony Bridgland, ''Sea Killers in Disguise'', page 21.&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Interviews with his subordinate officers have established LC Herbert's undisciplined manner of commanding his ship. Herbert allowed his men to engage in drunken binges during [[shore leave]]. During one such incident at the port of [[Dartmouth]], several members of the ''Baralong'''s crew were arrested after destroying a local saloon. Herbert first paid their bail and then left port with the indicted crewmen aboard. Beginning in April 1915, Herbert further ordered his subordinates cease calling him, &quot;Sir,&quot; and to address him only by the [[pseudonym]], &quot;Captain William McBride.&quot;&lt;ref&gt; ''Sea Killers in Disguise'', page 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the summer of 1915, the ''Baralong'' continued routine patrol duties in the Irish Sea without ever encountering the enemy. Frustration grew

On August 19, 1915, {{SMS|U-24||2|sub=y}} sank the White Star liner {{SS|Arabic|1902|6}} with the loss of 44 lives. The ''Baralong'' had been about {{convert|20|mi|abbr=on}} from the scene, and had received a distress call from the ship.&lt;ref name= oneill/&gt; ''Baralong'''s crew was infuriated and by their inability to locate survivors.&lt;ref name= messimer4647/&gt;

Meanwhile, about 100 miles south of Queenstown, ''U-27'', commanded by ''Kapitänleutnant'' Bernard Wegener, stopped the British steamer ''Nicosian'' in accordance with the rules laid down by the [[London Treaty]]. A boarding party of six men from the ''U-27'' discovered the ''Nicosian'' was carrying munitions and 250 American mules earmarked for the [[British Army]] in France. They allowed the freighter's crew and passengers into lifeboats, and prepared to sink the freighter with their [[deck gun]]. 

Simultaneously, the ''Baralong'' had intercepted the distress call of the ''Nicosian'' and was steaming on to the scene at full speed. Aboard her, the crew members muttered oaths through gritted teeth, vowing revenge for both the ''Arabic'' and the ''Lusitania''. 

''U-27'' was lying off ''Nicosian''{{'}}s port quarter firing into it when the ''Baralong'' appeared on the scene, flying the ensign of the United States as a [[false flag]]. When she was half a mile away ''Baralong'' ran up a signal flag to the effect that she was going to rescue ''Nicosian''{{'}}s crew. Wegener acknowledged the signal. He then ordered his men to cease firing, and took ''U-27'' along the port side of ''Nicosian'' to intercept the ''Baralong''. As the submarine disappeared behind the steamship, Herbert steered ''Baralong'' on a parallel course along ''Nicosian''{{'}}s starboard side.&lt;ref name=messimer4647&gt;Messimer, pp. 46–47.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before ''U-27'' came round ''Nicosian''{{'}}s bow, ''Baralong'' hauled down the American flag, hoisted the Royal Navy's [[White Ensign]], and unmasked her guns. As ''U-27'' came into view from behind ''Nicosian'', ''Baralong'' opened fire with her three [[12-pounder gun]]s at a range of {{convert|600|yd|abbr=on}}, firing 34 rounds. ''U-27'' rolled over and began to sink.&lt;ref name=messimer4647/&gt;&lt;ref name=oneill&gt;O'Neill&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Tony Bridgland, &lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Herbert screamed, 'Cease fire!' But his men's blood was up. They were avenging the ''Arabic'' and the ''Lusitania''. For them this was no time to cease firing, even as the survivors of the crew appeared on the outer casing, struggling out of their clothes to swim away from her. There was a mighty hiss of compressed air from her tanks and the ''U-27'' vanished from sight in a vortex of giant rumbing bubbles, leaving a pall of smoke over the spot where she had been. It had taken only a few minutes to fire the thirty-four shells into her.&quot;&lt;ref&gt; ''Sea Killers in Disguise'', pages 29-30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Meanwhile, the crew of the ''Nicosian'' watched from the lifeboats, cheering wildly. Captain Manning was heard to scream, &quot;If any of those bastard [[List of terms used for Germans#Hun|Huns]] come up, lads, hit 'em with an oar!&quot;&lt;ref&gt; ''Sea Killers in Disguise'', page 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

Twelve men survived the sinking of the submarine, the crews of her two deck guns and those who had been on the conning tower. They swam to the ''Nicosian'' and clambered up her hanging boat falls and pilot ladder. Herbert, worried that they might try to scuttle the steamer, ordered his men to open fire with small arms, killing all except six on the ''Nicosian''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Gibson | first = R.H. | authorlink = | coauthors = Maurice Prendergast | title = The German Submarine War 1914–1918 | publisher = Periscope Publishing Ltd | year = 2002 | location = | pages = 53 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 1904381081}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=grant&gt;{{cite book | last = Grant | first = Robert M. | authorlink = | coauthors =   | title = U-boats Destroyed: The Effect of Anti-submarine Warfare 1914–1918 | publisher = Periscope Publishing Ltd | year = 2002 | location = | pages = 27 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 1904381006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=halpern&gt;{{cite book | last = Halpern | first = Paul G. | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = A Naval History of World War I | publisher = Routledge | year = 1994 | location = | pages = 301 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 1857284984}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wegener is described by some accounts as being shot while trying to swim to the ''Baralong''.&lt;ref name=grant/&gt;

Herbert sent a party of twelve Royal Marines commanded by a Corporal Collins to the ''Nicosian'' to hunt the surviving German sailors down. As they departed, Herbert told Collins, &quot;Take no prisoners.&quot;&lt;ref&gt; ''Sea Killers in Disguise'', page 42.&lt;/ref&gt; They were discovered in the engine room and shot on sight. According to Sub-Lieutenant [[Gordon Steele]] of the ''Baralong'', &lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Wegener ran ran to a cabin on the upper deck -- I later found out it was Manning's bathroom. The marines broke down the door with the butts of their rifles, but Wegener squeezes through a scuttle and dropped into the sea. He still had his life-jacket on and put up his arms in surrender. Corporal Collins, however, took aim and shot him through the head.&quot;&lt;ref&gt; ''Sea Killers in Disguise'', page 43.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Corporal Collins later recalled that, after Wegener's death, Herbert threw a revolver in the German captain's face and screamed, &quot;What about the ''Lusitania'', you bastard!&quot;&lt;ref&gt; ''Sea Killers in Disguise'', page 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative account has the Germans who boarded the ''Nicosian'' being killed by the engine room staff; this apparently came from the officer in command of the muleteers.&lt;ref name=oneill/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = McGill | first = Harold W | authorlink = | coauthors = Marjorie Barron Norris | title = Medicine and Duty: The World War I Memoir of Captain Harold W.

=== Aftermath ===

In Herbert's report to the Admiralty, he stated he feared the survivors from the U-boat's crew would [[Boarding (attack)|board]] the freighter and scuttle her, so he ordered the [[Royal Marines]] on his ship to shoot the survivors. If they had scuttled the freighter, it could have been counted as negligence on the part of Herbert. Moments before ''Baralong'' began her attack, the submarine was firing on the freighter. It is not known if the escaping sailors actually intended to scuttle the freighter.

The Admiralty, upon receiving Herbert's report, immediately ordered its suppression (though it was not destroyed and is now available), but the strict censorship on the event failed when the Americans on aboard the ''Nicosian'' who had witnessed it from the lifeboats, spoke to newspaper reporters after their return to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Halpern&lt;/ref&gt;

=== German memorandum ===

The German government delivered a memorandum on the incident via the American ambassador in Berlin, who received it on 6 December 1915. In it, they cited six US citizens as witnesses, stating they had made sworn depositions regarding the incident before public notaries in the US.

The statements said that five survivors from ''U-27'' managed to board the ''Nicosian'', while the rest were shot and killed on Herbert's orders while clinging to the ''Nicosian''{{'}}s lifeboat falls (ropes). It was further stated that when Herbert ordered his Marines to board the ''Nicosian'', he gave the order &quot;take no prisoners&quot;. Four German sailors were found in the ''Nicosian''{{'}}s engine room and propeller shaft tunnel and were killed. According to the witness statements, ''U-27''{{'}}s commander was shot while swimming towards the ''Baralong''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = &quot;Baralong&quot; memorandum of the German Government | work = | publisher = WWW Virtual Library | date = | url = http://www.vlib.us/wwi/resources/archives/texts/t050925/Baralong.html | doi = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Memorandum demanded that the captain and crew of the ''Baralong'' be tried for the murder of unarmed German sailors, threatening to &quot;take serious decision as to retribution for the unpunished crime&quot;. Sir Edward Grey replied through the American ambassador that the incident could be grouped together with the Germans' sinking of the SS ''Arabic'', their attack on a stranded British submarine on the neutral Dutch coast, and their attack on the steamship ''Ruel'', and suggested that they be placed before a Tribunal composed of US Navy officers.&lt;ref name=reg&gt;{{cite book | last = Hesperides | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = The Annual Register Review of Public Events at Home and Abroad for the Year 1916 | publisher = READ BOOKS | year = 2007 | location = | pages = 58–59 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 1406751987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== German reaction ===

A debate took place in the Reichstag on 15 January 1916, where the ''Baralong'' incident was described as a &quot;cowardly murder&quot; and Grey's note as being &quot;full of insolence and arrogance&quot;. It was announced that reprisals had been decided, but not what form they would take.&lt;ref name=reg/&gt;

The outrage the ''Baralong'' incident aroused in Germany was used by the [[Kaiserliche Marine]] to justify sinkings without warning at sea during [[World War I]], and especially in [[World War II]] under [[Nazi Germany]]. A German medal was issued commemorating the event.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nmm.ac.uk/collections/explore/object.cfm?ID=MEC2375 Medal commemorating the sinking… (MEC2375) - National Maritime Museum&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The German Navy also put the ''Baralong'' and her crew on the &quot;Black List&quot;, meaning that any member of her crew was to be shot on sight if captured.

As a precaution to protect the ships against any reprisals against their crews, HMS ''Wyandra'' was transferred to the Mediterranean, and took the name of her sister ship ''Manica'', while ''Baralong'''s name was deleted from ''[[Lloyd's Register]]''. The ''Nicosian'' was renamed ''Nevisian'', and the crew was issued new Discharge Books, with the voyage omitted.&lt;ref name=oneill/&gt;

The crew of the ''Baralong'' were later awarded £185 prize bounty for sinking ''U-27''.&lt;ref name=chatterton&gt;{{cite book | last = Chatterton | first = E. Keble | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Q-Ships and Their Story | publisher = Ayer Publishing | year = 1980 | location = | pages = 26 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0405130341}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Kriegsmarine]] submarine flotilla formed on June 25, 1938, was named &quot;Wegener&quot; in memory of the U-boat commander in this incident.

== Second incident ==
=== Action of 24 September 1915 ===

On 24 September 1915, ''Baralong'' sank the U-boat {{SMS|U-41|Germany|2|sub=y}}, for which her commanding officer at the time, Lieutenant-Commander A. Wilmot-Smith, was later awarded £170 prize bounty.&lt;ref name=chatterton/&gt;

The ''U-41'' was in the process of sinking SS ''Urbino'' with gunfire when the ''Baralong'' arrived on the scene, flying an American flag. When ''U-41'' surfaced near the ''Baralong'', the latter opened fire, continuing to fly the American flag, and sank the U-boat.

=== Aftermath of the second incident ===

There were no neutral witnesses to the events that followed, apart from the German and British sailors present. Oberleutnant zur See Iwan Crompton later reported on the incident after he returned from a British prisoner of war camp, reporting that the ''Baralong'' had run down the lifeboat he was in; he leapt clear and was shortly after taken aboard the ''Baralong''. The British crew denied that they had run down the lifeboat.&lt;ref&gt;Messimer, pp. 61-62&lt;/ref&gt;

Crompton later published an account of ''[[U-41]]''{{'}}s exploits in 1917, &quot;U-41: der zweite Baralong-Fall&quot;, which called the sinking of ''U-41'' a &quot;second Baralong case&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hadley | first = Michael L. | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Count Not the Dead: The Popular Image of the German Submarine | publisher = McGill-Queen's Press - MQUP | year = 1995 | location = | pages = 36 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0773512829}}&lt;/ref&gt;



The event was also commemorated in a propaganda medal designed by the German Engraver [[Karl Goetz]]. This was one of many medals that were popular in Germany from around 1910 to 1940.

== Modern views of the incidents ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2009}}

It was a controversial event and many historians agree it was a [[war crime|violation of protocol]] to order sailors attacked. Other historians debate this analysis (such as if the order was a violation) or debate aspects of the records, and have been either harsher or more lenient. Widely available German, British, and American records agree on certain facts, but a number of details of the incident may or may not have been fabricated based upon a less notable or extensive violation.

Disputed facts mostly center on the number of German sailors who escaped the sinking sub, to be killed later. This dispute undermines the justification of the British captain's order to attack the German survivors, on the grounds of protecting the freighter and her cargo. It is not known to what extent escaping German sailors attempted to surrender.

'''Robert &quot;Bob&quot; Young''' is an entrepreneur who made a great deal of money from [[Red Hat]] software. He was born in [[Ancaster, Ontario]], [[Canada]].&lt;ref name=BYOUNG&gt;{{cite web| title = Biography: Bob Young| url=http://www.feduja.org/evites/2006_Tech_BobYoung/young.htm| accessdate = 2007-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended [[Trinity College School]] in [[Port Hope]], Ontario. He received a Bachelor of the Arts from [[Victoria University in the University of Toronto|Victoria College]] at the [[University of Toronto]]. 

He created the ACC Corporation which merged with [[Red Hat]] in 1995. From the merger to 1999 Bob Young was Red Hat's CEO. After leaving Red Hat he started [[Lulu (publisher)|Lulu]], a self-publishing web-site that claims to be the world's fastest-growing provider of print-on-demand books. He is Lulu's CEO. 

Young also co-founded ''[[Linux Journal]]'' in 1994, and in [[2003 CFL season|2003]], he purchased the [[Hamilton Tiger-Cats]], a [[Canadian Football League]] franchise. Young is also co-owner of the [[Carolina Railhawks]], a soccer team located in [[Cary, NC]] that plays in the [[USSF D-2]] Professional Soccer League. 

In 2006 Young established the Lulu Blooker Prize, a book prize for books that began as blogs. He launched the prize partly as a means of promoting Lulu.

Young is strong believer in [[user-generated content]] and [[open source software]]. In a 2008 interview he described the way that online [[social media]] has empowered consumers:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Today the Internet connects every single one of your customers, not just to you but to each other. So you produce a lemon of a car and you won’t know where to hide because your customers are going to tell each other about it and then the rest of the world about it. So it is actually a fundamentally healthy thing from a consumer point of view.

Conversely if you do have a better product suddenly you have these businesses that grow like top seed. If you come up with an innovation that serves, that resonates with customers, the Internet will allow that innovation to spread dramatically faster than any other technology has enabled a new innovation to be adopted in the history of mankind.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yourbusinesschannel.com/show/ideas/342/expert-business-advice-bob-young-on-why-the-people-are-more-powerful-than-ever “Expert Business Advice: Bob Young on why the people are more powerful than ever” (video)] Retrieved 2009-10-06&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Family==
[[Joyce Young]], Bob Young's aunt, purchased stock in Red Hat Inc. shortly after its founding. When Red Hat's stock rose significantly after its initial public offering in 1999, they sold enough stock to recoup their initial investment, and retained some stocks. By January 2000, the remaining stock was valued in the millions. In June 2000, she donated $40 million to the Hamilton Community Foundation to be used largely in improvement of Hamilton-area health facilities, an act that represented one of the single largest charitable donations in Canadian history. The couple also made significant donations to the [[Royal Military College of Canada]].

'''''Babylon 5''''' is an [[United States|American]] [[science fiction on television|science fiction television series]] created, produced and [[#Writing|largely written by]] [[J.

With its prominent use of planned [[story arc]]s, the series was often described as a &quot;novel for television&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;soaps1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |first=Jo-Ann |last=Parks |title=Soap Opera 'Babylon' - B5 and the Soaps |url=http://www.space.com/sciencefiction/tv/soap_opera_babylon_000317.html |work=SPACE.com |publisher=Imaginova Corp |date=2000-03-17 |accessdate=2009-10-18}}&lt;!-- original cite {{cite web |url=http://www.space.com/sciencefiction/tv/soap_opera_babylon_000317.html |title=Soap Opera 'Babylon' |publisher=Space.com |date=2000-03-17 |accessdate=2006-09-04}} --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cnn1&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Dennis |last=Michael |title='Babylon 5' prepares for final bow |url=http://www.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/TV/9811/20/babylon.5/ |work=[[CNN|CNN.com]] |publisher=Cable News Network |date=1998-11-20 |accessdate=2009-10-18}}&lt;!-- Original cite 2 {{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/TV/9811/20/babylon.5/ |title=&quot;Babylon 5&quot; Prepares For Final Bow |publisher=[[CNN]] |date=1998-11-20 |accessdate=2007-08-21}} --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The pilot film premiered on February 22, 1993. The regular series aired from January 26, 1994 and ran for five full seasons. Due to Warner corporate structure and policy concerning syndication in general and syndication of properties produced by the defunct [[Prime Time Entertainment Network|PTEN]] division in particular, the show has been syndicated only briefly and has not appeared on television since 2000. The show spawned six television films and a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] series, ''[[Crusade (TV series)|Crusade]]'', which aired in 1999 and ran for 13 episodes. On July 31, 2007, a [[DVD]] was released containing two short films about selected characters from the series.

== Concept ==
Having worked on a number of television science fiction shows which had regularly gone over budget, creator J. Michael Straczynski concluded that a lack of long-term planning was to blame, and set about looking at ways in which a series could be done responsibly. Taking note of the lessons of mainstream television, which brought stories to a centralised location such as a hospital, police station, or law office, he decided that instead of &quot;[going] in search of new worlds, building them anew each week,&quot; a fixed space station setting would keep costs at a reasonable level. A fan of sagas such as the [[Foundation series|''Foundation'' series]], ''[[Childhood's End]]'', ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', ''[[Dune universe|Dune]]'' and ''[[Lensman series]]'', Straczynski wondered why no one had done a television series with the same epic sweep, and concurrently with the first idea started developing the concept for a vastly-ambitious epic covering massive battles and other universe-changing events. Realizing that both the fixed-locale series and the epic could be done in a single series, he began to sketch the initial outline of what would become ''Babylon 5''.&lt;ref name=&quot;GEnie-1992&quot;&gt;{{cite web&lt;!-- Archive URL date taken from page metadata, main URL date taken is the one used for the entire document --&gt; |first=J.

Straczynski set five goals for ''Babylon 5''. He said that the show &quot;would have to be good science fiction&quot; as well as good television -- &quot;rarely are shows both good [science fiction] ''and'' good TV; there're {{sic}} generally one or the other [emphasis in original].&quot; It would have to do for science fiction television what ''[[Hill Street Blues]]'' had done for [[police drama]]s, by taking an adult approach to the subject. It would have to be reasonably budgeted, and &quot;it would have to look unlike anything ever seen before on TV, presenting individual stories against a much broader canvas.&quot; He further stressed that his approach was &quot;to take [science fiction] seriously, to build characters for grown-ups, to incorporate real science but keep the characters at the center of the story.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;GEnie-1991&quot;&gt;{{cite web&lt;!-- Note: The Google Cache archive for this cite has been removed because it is a dead link.

Instead, acting as a center of political intrigue and conflict, the station becomes the [[linchpin]] of a massive [[interstellar]] war. This is reflected in the opening monologue of each episode, which includes the words &quot;last, best hope for peace&quot; in season one, changing to &quot;last, best hope for victory&quot; by season three.

The series consists of a coherent five-year [[story arc]] taking place over five seasons of 22 episodes each. Unlike most television shows at the time, ''Babylon 5'' was conceived as a &quot;novel for television&quot;, with a defined beginning, middle, and end; in essence, each episode would be a single &quot;chapter&quot; of this &quot;novel&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;JMSyousay1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jmsnews.com/msg.aspx?id=1-10170 |title=You say, 'New characters and sets... |first=J.

[[Harlan Ellison]], a creative consultant on the show, received story credits for two episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Lurker's Guide to Babylon 5 |title=Writers/Directors list |url=http://www.midwinter.com/lurk/making/write-direct.html#write |accessdate=2007-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each writer was informed of the over-arching storyline, enabling the show to be produced consistently under-budget. The rules of production were strict; scripts were written six episodes in advance, and changes could not be made once production had started.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://tech.mit.edu/V118/N24/discuss.24n.html |title=Straczynski, Jablokov Discuss Television, The Future |author=Brett Altschul |publisher=[[The Tech (newspaper)|The Tech]] |date=1998-05-05 |accessdate=2007-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though conceived as a whole, it was necessary to adjust the plotline to accommodate external influences. Each of the characters in the series was written with a &quot;trap door&quot; into their background so that, in the event of an actor's unexpected departure from the series, the character could be written out with minimal impact on the storyline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.midwinter.com/lurk/misc/cc-leave.html |title=JMS on Claudia Christian's departure |accessdate=2006-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the words of Straczynski, &quot;As a writer, doing a long-term story, it'd be dangerous and short-sighted for me to construct the story without trap doors for every single character. ...

{{Quote box |quote=First thing I did was to flip out the stand-alones, which traditionally have taken up the first 6 or so episodes of each season; between two years, that's 12 episodes, over half a season right there.

Ratings for ''Babylon 5'' continued to rise during the show's third season, but going into the fourth season, the impending demise of network [[Prime Time Entertainment Network|PTEN]] left a fifth year in doubt. Unable to get word one way or the other from parent company [[Warner Bros.]], and unwilling to short-change the story and the fans, Straczynski began preparing modifications to the fourth season in order to allow for both eventualities. Straczynski identified three primary plot-threads which would require resolution: the Shadow war, Earth's slide into a dictatorship, and a series of sub-threads which branched off from those. Estimating they would still take around 27 episodes to resolve without having the season feel rushed, the solution came when the [[Turner Network Television|TNT]] network commissioned two ''Babylon 5'' television films. Several hours of material was thus able to be moved into the films, including a three-episode arc which would deal with the background to the [[Earth–Minbari War]], and a sub-thread which would have set up the sequel series, ''Crusade''. Further standalone episodes and plot-threads were dropped from season four, which could be inserted into ''Crusade'', or the fifth season, were it to be given the [[greenlight]].&lt;ref name=&quot;writing&quot;/&gt; The intended series finale, &quot;[[Sleeping in Light]]&quot;, was filmed during season four as a precaution against cancellation. When word came that TNT had picked up ''Babylon 5'', this was moved to the end of season five and replaced with a newly filmed season four finale, &quot;[[The Deconstruction of Falling Stars]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=How will this play out |author=[[J.

[[Foundation Imaging]] provided the special effects for the pilot film (for which it won an Emmy) and the first three seasons of the show. After the show's co-executive producer (Douglas Netter) and producer (John Copeland) approached Straczynski with the idea of producing the effects in-house, Straczynski agreed to replace Foundation, for season 4 and 5, once a new team had been established by [[Netter Digital]], and an equal level of quality was assured,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.babylonpodcast.com/tag/jms/ |title=Babylon Podcast #161: Interview with JMS, Part 1 |author=[[J.

Several dozen less powerful species from the [[League of Non-Aligned Worlds]] appear, including the [[Drazi]], [[Brakiri]], [[Vree]], [[Civilizations in Babylon 5#Markab|Markab]], and [[pak'ma'ra]].

While the original pilot film featured some [[Extraterrestrial life|aliens]] which were puppets and [[animatronics]], the decision was made early on in the show's production to portray most alien species as [[humanoid]] in appearance. Barring isolated appearances, fully [[Computer-generated imagery|computer-generated]] aliens were discounted as an idea due to the &quot;massive [[rendering (computer graphics)|rendering]] power&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;JMSemotion&quot; /&gt; required. Long-term use of puppets and animatronics was also discounted due to the technological limitations in providing convincing interaction with the human actors (&quot;…if you want any real ''emotion'' from the character, you're going to have to have an actor inside&quot; [emphasis in original]).&lt;ref name=&quot;JMSemotion&quot;&gt;{{cite newsgroup |title=Alien looking aliens |author=[[J.

=== Languages ===
There are three primary languages used on the Babylon 5 station: English, as well as the fictional Centauri and [[Interlac]].&lt;ref name=&quot;trans&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Orange County interview |author=[[J.

 |accessdate=2007-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other human and alien languages do exist in the ''Babylon 5'' universe, though with the exception of Minbari, hearing them spoken is uncommon; when aliens of the same species are speaking to one another, the words heard are English, though it is presumed they are speaking their native tongue. Only when in the presence of humans can the alien language be heard, to stress that the humans cannot understand what is being said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Yes, people will go to the bathroom |author=[[J.

The [[Gaim (Babylon 5)|Gaim]], [[pak'ma'ra]], and Vorlons do not speak directly in English; in the case of the pak'ma'ra, either because they refuse to learn any language other than their own,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Learning Curve (Babylon 5)|Learning Curve]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; or because they are incapable of making human sounds.&lt;ref name=&quot;trans&quot;/&gt; Members of these races instead make use of real-time translation devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Pat: sorry, but you're strictly... |author=[[J.

The principal human characters speak with an American English accent, with the exception of [[Marcus Cole]], who speaks with Jason Carter's natural British English accent.

Various other minor human characters speak English with recognizable regional accents. Ambassadors Delenn and Londo Mollari, both alien characters, speak with distinct accents similar to [[Slavic languages|Slavic]]. Delenn speaks with actress [[Mira Furlan]]'s normal [[Croatian language|Croatian]] accent; most other Minbari have native-speaker accents for English (for example, American English for Lennier, British English for [[Neroon]]). Londo's accent was developed independently by actor Peter Jurasik&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/377/377726p4.html |title=IGN: An Interview with Peter Jurasik |accessdate=2006-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was imitated by William Forward,&lt;ref name=&quot;Forward1&quot;/&gt; who played Lord Refa.

== Plot summary ==
{{Babylon5TVMovies}}
{{Main|List of Babylon 5 episodes}}
The five seasons of the series each correspond to one fictional sequential year in the period 2258–2262. Each season shares its name with an episode that is central to that season's plot. As the series starts, the Babylon 5 station is welcoming ambassadors from various races in the galaxy. Earth has just barely survived an accidental war with the powerful [[Minbari]], who, despite their superior technology, mysteriously surrendered at the brink of the destruction of the human race (the [[Battle of the Line]]).

=== Season 1 – year 2258 ===
{{Main|List of Babylon 5 episodes#Season 1: Signs and Portents}}
During 2258, [[Jeffrey Sinclair|Commander Jeffrey Sinclair]] is in charge of the station. Much of the story revolves around his gradual discovery that it was his capture by the Minbari at the Battle of the Line which ended the war against Earth. Upon capturing Sinclair, the Minbari came to believe that [[Valen]], a great Minbari leader and hero of the last Minbari-Shadow war, had been reincarnated as the Commander. Concluding that others of their species had been, and were continuing to be reborn as humans, and in obedience to the edict that Minbari do not kill one another, lest they harm the soul, they stopped the war just as [[Earth (Babylon 5)|Earth's]] final defenses were on the verge of collapse.

It is gradually revealed that [[Delenn|Ambassador Delenn]] is a member of the mysterious and powerful [[Grey Council]], the ruling body of the Minbari. Towards the end of 2258, she begins the transformation into a Minbari-human hybrid, ostensibly to build a bridge between the humans and Minbari. The year ends with the assassination of [[Earth Alliance (Babylon 5)|Earth Alliance]] President Luis Santiago, and rising tension between the Narn and Centauri, after a Narn outpost is completely destroyed by an unknown third party.

=== Season 2 – year 2259 ===
{{Main|List of Babylon 5 episodes#Season 2: The Coming of Shadows}}
At the beginning of 2259, [[John Sheridan (Babylon 5)|Captain John Sheridan]] replaces Sinclair as the military governor of the station. He and the command staff learn that the death of President Santiago was actually an assassination masterminded by Vice President Clark (who assumed the Presidency upon Santiago's death). A conflict develops between the Babylon 5 command staff and the [[Psi Corps]], an increasingly [[autocratic]] organization which oversees and controls the lives of human [[telepathy|telepaths]]. Commander Ivanova, the second-in-command of the station, is secretly a latent telepath who has illicitly avoided registering with the Psi Corps.

The Shadows, an ancient and extremely powerful race who have recently emerged from hibernation, are revealed to be the cause of a variety of mysterious and disturbing events, including the attack on the Narn outpost at the end of 2258. Centauri Ambassador [[Londo Mollari]] unknowingly enlists their aid through his association with the mysterious [[Mr. Morden]] in the ongoing conflict with the Narn. The elderly and ailing Centauri emperor, long an advocate of reconciliation with the Narn, dies suddenly while visiting Babylon 5. A number of conspirators, including Londo Mollari and Refa, take control of Centauri government by assassinating their opponents and placing the late emperor's unstable nephew on the throne. Their first act is to start open aggression against the Narn. After full-scale war breaks out, the Centauri eventually conquer Narn in a brutal attack involving [[mass driver]]s, outlawed [[weapons of mass destruction]]. Towards the end of the year, the Clark administration begins to show increasingly totalitarian characteristics, clamping down on dissent and restricting [[freedom of speech]]. The [[Vorlon]]s are revealed to be the basis of legends about [[angel]]s on various worlds, including Earth, and are the ancient enemies of the Shadows. They enlist the aid of Sheridan and the Babylon 5 command staff in the struggle against the Shadows.

=== Season 3 – year 2260 ===
{{Main|List of Babylon 5 episodes#Season 3: Point of No Return}}
The Psi Corps and President Clark, whose government has discovered Shadow vessels buried in Earth's solar system, begin to harness the vessels' advanced technology. The Clark administration continues to become increasingly [[xenophobia|xenophobic]] and totalitarian, and uses a military incident as an excuse to declare martial law. This triggers a war of independence on [[Mars]], which had long had a strained political relationship with Earth. Babylon 5 also declares independence from Earth, along with several other outlying Earth Alliance colonies. In response, the Earth Alliance attempts to retake Babylon 5 by force, but with the aid of the Minbari, who have allied with the station against the growing Shadow threat, the attack is repelled.

Becoming concerned over the Shadows' growing influence amongst his people, Centauri ambassador Londo Mollari attempts to sever ties with them. [[Morden (Babylon 5)|Mr. Morden]], the Shadows' human representative, tricks him into restoring the partnership by engineering the murder of Mollari's mistress while putting the blame on a rival Centauri House. Open warfare breaks out between the Shadows and the alliance led by Babylon 5 and the Minbari. It is learned that genetic manipulation by the Vorlons is the source of human telepathy, as it is later discovered that Shadow ships are vulnerable to telepathic attacks. Displeased at the Vorlons' lack of direct action against the Shadows, Captain John Sheridan browbeats Vorlon ambassador [[Kosh Naranek]] into launching an attack against their mutual enemy. Kosh's deeds lead to his subsequent assassination by the Shadows.

Upon returning to the station, former commander Jeffrey Sinclair enlists the aid of Captain Sheridan, Delenn, Ivanova and Marcus and convinces them to help him steal the [[Babylon 4]] space station, intending to send it back in time 1,000 years to use it as a base of operations against the Shadows in the first Minbari-Shadow war. Undergoing the same transformation as Delenn at the end of Season 1, Sinclair transforms into a Minbari and is subsequently revealed to be the actual Valen of Minbari legend, rather than a reincarnation. Spurred by the reappearance of his assumed-dead wife (who now works for the Shadows), Sheridan travels to [[Z'ha'dum (planet)|Z'ha'dum]], the Shadow homeworld, in an attempt by them to recruit him. However he instead destroys their largest city in a ''kamikaze'' nuclear attack, and is last seen jumping into a miles-deep pit to escape the explosion.
Garibaldi, during a fight with Shadow vessels, goes missing.

=== Season 4 – year 2261 ===
{{Main|List of Babylon 5 episodes#Season 4: No Surrender, No Retreat}}
In 2261, the Vorlons join the Shadow War, but their tactics become a concern for the alliance when the Vorlons begin destroying entire planets which they deem to have been &quot;influenced&quot; by the Shadows. Disturbed by this turn of events, Babylon 5 recruits several other powerful and ancient races (the [[First Ones]]) to their cause, against both the Shadows and the Vorlons. Captain John Sheridan returns to the station after escaping from Z'ha'dum, but at a price: barring illness or injury, he has only 20 years left to live. He is accompanied by a mysterious alien named Lorien who claims to be the oldest sentient being in the galaxy.

Hours before Sheridan's return, Garibaldi is rescued back to the station, in rather dubious circumstances. He is markedly more paranoid and suspicious of other alien races and of Sheridan than he was before.

Centauri Emperor [[Cartagia]] forges a relationship with the Shadows. Londo Mollari engineers the assassination of Cartagia and repudiates his agreement with the Shadows. Londo kills Mr. Morden and destroys the Shadow vessels based on the [[Centauri Prime|Centauri homeworld]], in an attempt to save his planet from destruction by the Vorlons. Aided by the other ancient races, and several younger ones, Sheridan lures both the Vorlons and the Shadows into an immense battle, during which the [[Vorlon]]s and Shadows reveal that they have been left as guardians of the younger races, but due to philosophical differences, ended up using them as pawns in their endless wars throughout the ages. The younger races reject their continued interference, and the Vorlons and Shadows, along with the remaining First Ones, agree to depart the galaxy forever.

After the Shadows are defeated Garibaldi leaves his post as security chief and works on his own as a &quot;provider of information&quot;. Garibaldi was actually abducted by the Psi-Corps at the end of Season 3 and re-programmed by Bester to provide information to him at the right time.

[[Minbar (planet)|Minbar]] is gripped by a brief civil war between the Warrior and Religious castes. Delenn secretly meets with Neroon of the Warrior caste and convinces him that neither side can be allowed to win. She tells him that she will undergo a ritual wherein she will be willing to sacrifice herself, but will stop the ritual before she actually dies. When Neroon sees that she actually intends to go through the entire ritual, he rescues her and sacrifices himself instead, declaring that, although he was born Warrior, in his heart he is Religious.

As part of the ongoing conflict between Earth and Babylon 5, Garibaldi betrays Sheridan and arranges his capture. Garibaldi later reveals to Bester information about a virus that is dangerous to only telepaths, which the Psi-Corps then destroys. Bester releases Garibaldi of his programming, and allows him to remember everything he has done since being kidnapped. Garibaldi helps free Sheridan and return him to the campaign to free Earth. An alliance led by Babylon 5 frees Earth from totalitarian rule by President Clark in a short but bloody war. This culminates in Clark's suicide and the restoration of democratic government. Mars is granted full independence, and Sheridan agrees to step down as commander of Babylon 5. The [[League of Non-Aligned Worlds]] is dissolved and reformed into the [[Interstellar Alliance (Babylon 5)|Interstellar Alliance]], with Sheridan elected as its first President and continuing his command of the [[Anla'shok|Rangers]], who are to act as a galactic equivalent of [[United Nations peacekeepers]].

In the season finale, the events of 100, 500, 1000, and one million years into the future are shown, depicting Babylon 5's lasting influence throughout history. Amongst the events shown are the political aftermath of the 2261 civil war, a subsequent nuclear war on Earth involving a new totalitarian government in the year AD 2762, the resulting fall of Earth into a [[pre-industrial society]], the loss and restoration of humanity's knowledge of space travel, and the final evolution of mankind into energy beings similar to the Vorlons, after which Earth's sun goes [[nova]].

=== Season 5 – year 2262 ===
{{Main|List of Babylon 5 episodes#Season 5: The Wheel of Fire}}
In 2262, Earthforce Captain [[Elizabeth Lochley]] is appointed to command Babylon 5. The station grows in its role as a sanctuary for rogue telepaths running from the [[Psi Corps]], resulting in a violent conflict. [[G'Kar]], former Narn ambassador to Babylon 5, becomes a spiritual leader after a book was published that he wrote while incarcerated during the Narn-Centauri War. The [[Drakh]], former allies of the Shadows who remained in the galaxy, take control of [[Regent]] [[Virini]] on Centauri Prime through a parasitic creature called a Keeper, then incite a war between the Centauri and the Interstellar Alliance, in order to isolate the Centauri from the Alliance, and gain a malleable homeworld for themselves.

Centauri Prime is consequently decimated by [[Narn]] and [[Drazi]] warships, and Londo Mollari becomes emperor, accepting a Drakh Keeper under threat of the complete nuclear destruction of the planet. Portions of the end of his reign are seen in various prescient visions throughout the series; one such sequence shows Mollari and former nemesis (and later friend) G'Kar dying at each other's throats. [[Vir Cotto]], Mollari's loyal and more moral aide, succeeds him as emperor, free of Drakh influence. Sheridan and Delenn marry and move to Minbar, along with the headquarters of the Interstellar Alliance.

Twenty years later, on the verge of death, Sheridan takes one final trip to the now-obsolete Babylon 5 station before its decommissioning. Sheridan apparently dies, but is claimed by the First Ones, who invite him to join them on a journey beyond the rim of the galaxy. The Babylon 5 station is completely destroyed in a planned demolition shortly after Sheridan's departure, its existence no longer necessary as the Alliance has taken over its diplomatic purposes. This final episode features a cameo appearance by Straczynski as the technician who switches off the lights before Babylon 5 is evacuated and destroyed.

Throughout its run, ''Babylon 5'' found ways to portray [[theme (literature)|theme]]s relevant to modern and historical social issues.

The clash between order and chaos, and the people caught in between, plays an important role in ''Babylon 5''. The conflict between two unimaginably powerful older races, the [[Vorlons]] and the [[Shadow (Babylon 5)|Shadows]], is represented as a battle between two competing ideologies, each seeking to turn the humans and the other younger races to their beliefs.

The ''Babylon 5'' universe deals with numerous armed conflicts which range on an interstellar scale. The story begins in the aftermath of a war which brought the human race to the brink of extinction, caused by a misunderstanding during a [[first contact (science fiction)|first contact]] situation.&lt;ref name=&quot;january&quot;/&gt; The Babylon 5 station is subsequently built in order to foster peace through diplomacy, described as the &quot;last, best hope for peace&quot; in the opening credits monologue during its first three seasons. Wars between separate alien civilizations are featured. The conflict between the [[Narn]] and the [[Centauri (Babylon 5)|Centauri]] is followed from its beginnings as a minor territorial dispute amplified by historical animosity, through to its end, in which [[weapons of mass destruction]] are employed to subjugate and enslave an entire planet. The war is an attempt to portray a more sobering kind of conflict than usually seen on science fiction television. Informed by the events of the first [[Gulf War]], the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] and the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Prague_Spring#Invasion|invasion of Prague]], the intent was to recreate these moments when &quot;the world held its breath&quot; and the emotional core of the conflict was the disbelief that the situation could have occurred at all, and the desperation to find a way to bring it to an end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newsgroup |title=Coming of Shadows |author=[[J.

The [[Shadow War]] also features prominently in the show, during which an advanced alien species attempts to sow the seeds of conflict in order to promote technological and cultural advancement.

The struggle for independence between [[Mars]] and Earth culminates with a civil war between the human colonies (led by the Babylon 5 station) and the home planet.

=== Sacrifice ===
A major theme in ''Babylon 5'' is the concept of sacrifice for a greater cause. Kosh sacrifices his life for a first victory against the [[Shadow (Babylon 5)|Shadow]]s. [[John Sheridan (Babylon 5)|John Sheridan]] is ready to die at [[Z'ha'dum]]. [[Delenn]] is ready to die in the starfire wheel to restore [[Minbari]] society. [[Marcus Cole]] gives his life to save [[Susan Ivanova]]. [[Londo Mollari]] willingly accepts complete enslavement by a Drakh keeper to save the [[Centauri (Babylon 5)|Centauri]] from annihilation. Many minor characters also willingly give their lives such as the crew of [[Drazi]] or [[Minbari]] ships in the final confrontation with the [[Shadow (Babylon 5)|Shadow]]s to save the Army of Light's leaders, some Centauri staying back at the island of Selini to allow the destruction of the Shadow warships, and so on. &quot;Some of us must be sacrificed if all are to be saved.&quot; is the spiritual epiphany experienced by [[G'Kar]]. This reflects the [[Vorlon]] philosophy in contrast to the self-interest philosophy of the [[Shadow (Babylon 5)|Shadow]]s.

=== Dreams and visions ===
The subliminal and [[subconscious]] play a very significant role in the ''Babylon 5'' universe. Every single major character experiences, on at least one occasion, some altered state of consciousness in which he or she receives some sort of important mental message. This could either be one that further fleshes out the character for the benefit of the viewer, or one of transcendental and transpersonal nature that anticipates important further developments in the storyline. Some of these signs and portents resemble [[lucid dream]]s, but many are quite bizarre and &quot;dreamlike,&quot; frequently in a spiritual context.

=== Addiction ===
Substance abuse and its impact on human personalities also plays a significant role in the ''Babylon 5'' storyline. The station's security chief, [[Michael Garibaldi]], is a textbook relapsing-remitting [[alcoholic]] of the [[binge drinking]] type; he practices complete [[abstinence]] from alcohol throughout most of the series (with [[Survivors (Babylon 5)|one notable exception]]) until the [[Phoenix Rising (Babylon 5)|middle of season five]]. He only recovers physically and socially and breaks the cycle at the end of the season. Dr. [[Stephen Franklin]] develops an (initially unrecognized) addiction to injectable [[stimulant]] drugs while trying to cope with the chronic stress and work overload in Medlab (stemming from the Markab extinction), and wanders off to the homeless and deprived in Brown Sector, where he suffers through a severe [[withdrawal]] syndrome. Executive Officer [[Susan Ivanova]] mentions that her father became an alcoholic after her mother had committed suicide after having been drugged by the authorities over a number of years. Captain [[Elizabeth Lochley]] tells Garibaldi that her father was an alcoholic and that she is a recovering alcoholic herself.&lt;ref&gt;Season 5, Episode 19: The Wheel of Fire&lt;/ref&gt; Among the aliens, [[Londo Mollari]] is at least a heavy abuser of alcohol, mostly in the form of the Centauri national drink, Brivari (though in Centauri culture, sobriety, as opposed to drunkenness, is considered a vice).

Numerous other references to substance abuse and drug dealing are scattered throughout the storyline, including [[Psi Corps#Dust|Dust]], a white powder with a black-market presence comparable to cocaine. &quot;Dust&quot; turns out to be a &quot;designer drug&quot; developed by [[Psi Corps]] and placed into the black market as an experiment to see if psychic abilities could be brought out in &quot;mundanes&quot; (non-telepaths).

== Television movies ==
During and after production of ''Babylon 5'', six [[television movie]]s, set in the ''Babylon 5'' universe, have been produced.

''The Gathering'' is the pilot, depicting the arrival of the major characters to the Babylon 5 station in 2257. ''In the Beginning'' depicts the events of the Earth-Minbari War, as revealed in the first few seasons, in chronological order and in greater detail than the main series. ''Thirdspace'' and ''The River of Souls'' are largely stand-alone episodes.

''A Call to Arms'' sets up the initial premise of the ''[[Crusade (TV series)|Crusade]]'' series, depicting the alien [[Drakh]] species releasing a [[grey goo|nanovirus plague]] on Earth, which will destroy all life on the planet within five years if it is not stopped. To that end, the [[Victory class destroyer|destroyer]] ''[[Excalibur (Crusade)|Excalibur]]'' is sent to look for a cure beyond Earth. ''To Live and Die in Starlight'', also known as ''Babylon 5: The Legend of the Rangers'', was intended as the pilot for the series of the same (''Legend of the Rangers'') name, but since the show was never picked up, it is now considered to be the sixth and last ''Babylon 5'' telefilm.

== Spin-offs ==
=== ''Crusade'' ===
{{Main|Crusade (TV series)}}
The spin-off series ''[[Crusade (TV series)|Crusade]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.midwinter.com/lurk/countries/us/guide/113.html |title=The Babylon Project: Crusade - Overview |publisher=midwinter.com |work=The Lurker's Guide To Babylon 5 |accessdate=2006-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; ran on [[Turner Network Television|TNT]] for 13 episodes, having been set up by the TV film ''A Call to Arms''. The production team received help from [[NASA]]'s [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] to make sure that the series depicted science and technology accurately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/releases/98/crusade2.html |publisher=NASA JPL |title=Producers of 'Babylon 5' tap JPL's brain power for new series |accessdate=2006-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, creative differences between Straczynski and TNT caused problems; the network wanted more sex and violence,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aint-it-cool-news.com/display.cgi?id=2060 |title=Changes to Crusade |publisher=Ain't It Cool News |accessdate=2006-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and forced Straczynski to begin the first episode with a fistfight. The sex-and-violence request was later withdrawn, and TNT allocated more money to ''Crusade'', giving the actors better uniforms and new sets mid-season. However, due to the creative differences, TNT eventually decided to cancel the series after 13 episodes had been produced, but before any of them were aired. At the time of the cancellation, only hints of major story arcs had yet come into play, though unproduced scripts published online by Straczynski—in addition to comments made by him online, at conventions, and on the ''Crusade'' DVD commentaries—reveal that these arcs would have become prominent features of the series, had it continued.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

=== ''Legend of the Rangers'' ===
{{Main|Babylon 5: The Legend of the Rangers}}
A television film titled ''[[Babylon 5: The Legend of the Rangers|To Live and Die in Starlight]]'' was produced by the [[Syfy|Sci Fi Channel]]. It was the proposed pilot episode of a new series titled ''[[Babylon 5: The Legend of the Rangers]]''. Rescheduled after the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], the film aired on January 19, 2002. However, it was scheduled against an [[NFL]] [[American Football Conference|AFC]] Divisional Championship playoff game. The pilot's poor ratings contributed to the lessening of the network's interest in a series pick-up, as did the poor reception it received from fans and critics alike, particularly for its depiction of a virtual-reality weapon, but the final nail in its coffin was the dispute between Warner Bros. and [[Vivendi Universal]] (owners of the Sci Fi Channel) over revenue-sharing for the potential weekly series.

=== ''The Lost Tales'' ===
{{Main|Babylon 5: The Lost Tales}}
A new project set in ''Babylon 5'' universe was announced by Straczynski at [[San Diego Comic Con]] 2006.&lt;ref name=&quot;jmsnewsnews&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Schroeder |first=Jan |title=JMSNews news page |work = JMSNews, The J. Michael Straczynski Message Archive |date=2006-08-08 |url=http://jmsnews.com/news.aspx |accessdate=2006-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Babylon 5: The Lost Tales'' is a set of mini-stories featuring established characters from the series, released direct-to-DVD. Production of the first anthology of two stories, named collectively ''[[Babylon 5: The Lost Tales#Voices in the Dark|Voices in the Dark]]'', commenced in November 2006 with Straczynski writing, producing, and directing. It was released July 31, 2007. In a [[Usenet]] post on September 5, 2007, Straczynski stated that Warner Bros. &quot;are most pleased as sales have been several orders of magnitude beyond what they anticipated.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worldsofjms.com/usenet/post/070905a.htm |title=Re: JMS: A Rant |accessdate=2007-10-25 |last=Straczynski |first=J. Michael |authorlink=J. Michael Straczynski |date=2007-09-05 |publisher=[[rec.arts.sf.tv.babylon5.moderated]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 13, 2008, Straczynski revealed that he had no plans to continue ''The Lost Tales''. He said that although the studio was interested in another disc, they wanted to budget the next installment similarly to the first. Citing his disappointment with the first release due to the low budget, Straczynski said he did not want to dilute ''Babylon 5'''s legacy with further sub-par stories. He stated that he would only return to the ''Babylon 5'' universe if Warner Bros. wanted to do a large-budgeted cinema release.&lt;ref name=&quot;update&quot;&gt;{{cite newsgroup |title=from jms: update |author=[[J.

=== ''The Memory of Shadows'' (unproduced) ===
{{Main|The Memory of Shadows}}
In 2004 and early 2005, rumors widely circulated about a planned ''Babylon 5'' film for theatrical release. However, on February 25, 2005, a post from Straczynski announced that the project had fallen through, and was for all practical purposes dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jmsnews.com/msg.aspx?id=1-17289 |title=From jms re: tmos |accessdate=2006-08-18 |author=jms}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposed film, titled ''[[The Memory of Shadows]]'' (TMoS), was written by Straczynski. Filming was to have begun in April 2005 in the UK, with Steven Beck as the director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monstersandcritics.com/movies/news/article_2833.php/Steven_Beck_to_Direct_Babylon_5_Movie_The_Memory_of_Shadows|title=Steven Beck to Direct Babylon 5 Movie The Memory of Shadows|date=2004-12-08|accessdate=2009-07-28|author=James Wray}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the &quot;Spotlight on J. Michael Straczynski&quot; panel at the 2010 [[New York Comic Con]], Straczynski revealed “I said to Warner Bros. a while back, 'When you’re ready to do something real with 'Babylon 5,' either a big-budget film or a TV show, if you want to do one of those two things, call me, otherwise don’t bother me.' About a month ago the phone rang. I don’t know where this is gonna go yet, but when they call you, there’s something going on. I can’t tell you what it is yet and it may not go anywhere, but there is movement in the tall grass.”&lt;ref name=&quot;comicbookresources1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=28907|title=NYCC: Spotlight on J. Michael Straczynski|date=2010-10-15|accessdate=2010-10-17|author=Karl Keily - Comic Book Resources}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Novels, short stories and comic books ===
{{Main|Babylon 5 novels, short stories and comic books}}
Unique to the ''Babylon 5'' universe among virtually all other shared media universes is the sanctioned canonicity of many of its offshoot novels and comic book stories; nearly all of the ''Babylon 5'' novels and novelizations to date having been based on outlines written directly by J. Michael Straczynski. The later Del Rey books are considered to be more [[canon (fiction)|canonical]] than some of the earlier Del ones, and at least two major plotline revelations were made in the [[DC Comics]] series that were directly referenced in the TV series. In all, per Straczynski's own remarks, canonical elements exist in every single book or comic published to date, and his deeper involvement in the novel-publishing program from 1996 onward has ensured a greater level of canonicity within such works.

Additionally, Straczynski himself penned a number of short stories, published in ''[[Amazing Stories]]'' magazine, expanding on several key story-points from the television series, along with a number of other established authors, with all such tales considered as &quot;real&quot; as the TV show itself.

As of 2007, Straczynski was still writing the manuscript for a ''Babylon 5'' graphic novel, which was to be published by [[Wildstorm Productions]]. The premise, characters, and plot have not been officially confirmed, but it has been reported that Straczynski originally planned to write a story that takes place before the season three two-parter &quot;[[War Without End (Babylon 5)|War Without End]]&quot;, featuring Sinclair and Sheridan, and involving Mars, Minbar, Babylon 5, and a conspiracy. It has also been reported that he subsequently decided to tie in elements from the spin-offs ''Crusade'' and ''Legend of the Rangers'' into the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://worldsofjms.com/projects.htm#b5book |title=Straczynski Project Watch |accessdate=2007-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The graphic novel was to be 100 pages long.

When asked by a fan during the &quot;Spotlight on J. Michael Straczynski&quot; panel at the 2010 New York Comic Con, Straczynski said no new ''Babylon 5'' comics were in the works.&lt;ref name=&quot;comicbookresources1&quot;/&gt;

== DVD releases ==
=== Season releases ===
[[File:Babylon 5 Season 1.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The first season DVD set]]
All five seasons have been released individually as a set of six DVDs in the US and the UK. A complete five season set of 30 DVDs is also available in each of the two DVD regions, titled ''Babylon 5: The Complete Television Series'' for the US and Canada, and ''Babylon 5: The Complete Universe'' for the UK. The UK version also includes all the films and the short-lived spin-off ''[[Crusade (TV series)|Crusade]]''. As of 2007, all 5 television seasons and their individual episodes are also for sale at the [[iTunes Store]]. The first five seasons have been recently re-released on DVD with publishing dates of June 2009.

According to producer J. Michael Straczynski as of mid-2006, &quot;The DVD sales have raised over 500 million in revenue.&quot; The financial success of the DVD box sets has led to a renewed interest in further ''Babylon 5'' work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ain't It Cool News|date=2006-07-24|url=http://www.aintitcool.com/display.cgi?id=23963|title=Babylon 5 Returns!|accessdate=2009-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Babylon 5'' TV film releases ===
[[File:Babylon 5 The Movie Box Set.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The Movie Collection DVD set]]
The ''Babylon 5'' TV films were distributed differently in the US and UK. Initially a DVD containing the two films ''The Gathering'' and ''In the Beginning'' were released on both region 1 (North America) and region 2 (UK) DVD. Then, in the US, the first five films, which aired while ''Babylon 5'' was still on the air, were released in one boxset, with the TV film ''Legend of the Rangers'' getting its own separate release on both region 1 and region 2 DVD. In the UK, a film boxset was released, but instead of containing the five films like the US version, it contained only the three films which had not been released in the UK yet (''Thirdspace'', ''River of Souls'', and ''A Call to Arms''). ''The Gathering'' was released as a low-priced promotional R1 DVD in 2004, intended as a trial of the series proper; Warner Bros. issued several such DVDs but discontinued the line shortly thereafter due to lack of interest.

=== Mastering problems ===
The transfer of ''Babylon 5'' from fullscreen to widescreen (originally for the Sci Fi Channel; later released on DVD) created significant problems with regard to [[special effect|special-effects]]/[[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] footage. Several factors complicated the process.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herranen1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.modeemi.fi/~leopold/Babylon5/DVD/DVDTransfer.html |title=How Babylon 5 is Transferred to DVD |accessdate=2009-10-15 |author=Henrik Herranen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Although originally broadcast in the standard television [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] of [[Aspect ratio (image)|4:3]], all live-action footage was filmed on [[Super 35 mm film]] (with a ratio of [[Aspect ratio (image)|1.65:1]]). The idea was that, once [[widescreen]] televisions (with an aspect ratio of [[Aspect ratio (image)|16:9]] or [[Aspect ratio (image)|1.78:1]]) became more popular, the episodes could be easily converted into a widescreen format.
* CGI shots were rendered in the 4:3 ratio, but designed so that the top and bottom of each shot could be removed to create a widescreen image without ruining the image composition. For the widescreen DVD releases technical problems occurred during the [[progressive scan]] transfer and re-formatting, introducing artifacts that resulted in a picture quality of the CGI shots now inferior to the few [[laserdisc]] and other 4:3 home video releases.
* While the camera negatives of the original live-action shots held the potential for [[High-definition television|high-definition]] digital images, the CGI shots and shots combining live-action with CGI, were stored in the much lower-definition [[NTSC]] digital format. (Again, the expectation was that it would be relatively cheap in the future to recreate the CGI in widescreen.)
* Over the years, the original computer-generated models, and so on, have been lost, making it necessary to use the old 4:3 CGI shots. Both [[Foundation Imaging]] and its successor, [[Netter Digital]], have gone out of business.

This has resulted in several consistent flaws throughout the ''Babylon 5'' widescreen release. In particular, quality drops significantly whenever a scene cuts from purely live-action to a shot combining live-action and CGI. This is particularly noticeable on the [[PAL]] DVDs, since CGI shots had to be converted from NTSC, as well as being blown up to fit a widescreen television. In addition, while the live-action film was originally widescreen, shots were composed for 4:3, resulting in a conspicuous tendency for actors to clump up in the middle of the screen.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herranen1&quot;/&gt;

For these reasons, [[Warner Home Video]] is unlikely to release the series on [[Blu-Ray]]. Additionally, a [[Blu-Ray]] version of the first ''Lost Tales'' installment, ''Voices in the Dark'', was cancelled due to poor sales.

== Soundtrack releases ==
A total of 30 soundtrack albums have been released for ''Babylon 5''. They are all composed by the series composer Christopher Franke and released under his own record label Sonic Images.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web&lt;!-- The page is dynamically generated so the page's 'date' parameter ends up being the same as the access date.

=== Compilation soundtracks ===
These include music that appeared throughout the series, but have been extensively reorchestrated, rewritten, and remixed by Franke into lengthy movements. The second full-length CD also features the main titles from seasons 1 to 4 (the main title for season 5 can be heard on the CD ''Best of Babylon 5'', released in 2001).

=== Episodic and feature film soundtracks ===
The 27 episodic and feature film soundtracks include the exact unedited music from each corresponding episode or feature film, with no alterations, omissions, or additions.

== Other releases ==
Seasons 1–2 and parts of season 3 of ''Babylon 5'' have been released as advertisement-supported downloads through the [[In2TV]] and [[Hulu]] download services. Additionally, every episode from seasons 1 to 5, as well as the pilot film ''[[Babylon 5: The Gathering]]'', are available for purchase on the Xbox Live Marketplace in the United States. All 5 seasons, and 5 movies (''In The Beginning'',Thirdspace, ''River of Souls'', ''A Call To Arms'', ''Legend of the Rangers'') are available through [[iTunes]]. All 92 television episode scripts (plus two TV film scripts) written by J.

== Games ==
In November 1997, Chameleon Eclectic Entertainment published the original ''The Babylon Project: The Roleplaying Game Based on Babylon 5''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Babylon Project: The Roleplaying Game Based on Babylon 5 |author=Cochran, Joseph |publisher=Chameleon Eclectic Entertainment, Inc. |month=November |year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, [[Mongoose Publishing]] printed the ''Babylon 5 Roleplaying Game &amp; Factbook''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Babylon 5 Roleplaying Game &amp; Factbook |author=Hahn, August |coauthors=Matthew Sprange|publisher=[[Mongoose Publishing]] |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Babylon 5 Component Game system was also released in 1997 by 'Component Game Systems'. It was a complex political and military based game, using a number of individually purchased expansions or components, which could take up to 5 hours to play. Component Game Systems came out with a number of component game systems that used the same semi-collectible approach, and was derived from the unpublished Galactic Empires board game, based on the CCG of the same name—Companion Games (Galactic Empires' publisher) became Component Game Systems in the process. The basic idea is that each player need only buy his part of the game, representing in this case a specific political entity from the Babylon 5 universe. Players sit down at the same table and combine their components to have a game. 'Component Game Systems' folded in 1999 after having released only the first two 'years' (2258 and 2259) worth of Babylon related components for the game, and even their domain name (www.c-g-s.com) has been recycled by some unrelated group.

The ''[[Babylon 5 Wars]]'' [[wargaming|wargame]] was first published by [[Agents of Gaming]] in 1998. The game was developed in close contact with the creators of the show, and most of the published material is considered canon.&lt;ref&gt;Graw, B. and Glass, R.: &quot;Babylon 5 Wars Second Edition Rules Compendium.&quot;, page 1. Agents of Gaming, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Agents of Gaming later published ''[[Babylon 5 Fleet Action]]'', which focused on battles of a larger scale. In 2004, ''[[Babylon 5: A Call to Arms (game)|Babylon 5: A Call to Arms]]'' was released by Mongoose Publishing. The game is similar in many ways to ''Babylon 5 Wars'' but has a more streamlined rules set and games take a lot less time to complete.

[[Precedence Entertainment]] produced the [[Babylon 5 Collectible Card Game]] between 1997 and 2000. In its original form, the [[collectible card game|game]] allowed for 2-4 players with each one playing one of the ambassadors to the B5 council: Sinclair, Delenn, G'Kar or Londo. Later expansions increased the maximum number of players that could play at once and expanded the players' options. Players could represent the [[League of Non-Aligned Worlds]] or could play alternative ambassadors such as Bester for the [[Psi Corps]] or Lord Refa for the Centauri. The game was discontinued after Precedence lost the license from [[Warner Brothers]] in 2000.

There are no officially licensed ''Babylon 5'' video games on the market, though in 1998 a video game based on ''Babylon 5'', named ''Into the Fire'', was being developed by Yosemite Entertainment, an internal division of [[Sierra Entertainment]]. Work on this game ended on September 21, 1999, when, as part of a corporate reorganization, Sierra cancelled it and laid off its development staff when the game was only a few months away from release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.space.com/sciencefiction/babylon5_990922.html |title=More Disappointment for Babylon 5 |accessdate=2006-09-02|author=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This game was to have cast the player as the pilot of a Starfury fighter craft, giving the player an opportunity to &quot;move up through the ranks,&quot; and eventually take command of capital ships and even fleets. Christopher Franke composed and recorded new music for the game, and [[live action]] footage was filmed with the primary actors from the series.

A number of unauthorized ''Babylon 5 '' [[mod (computer gaming)|modifications]] have been created for other computer games such as Homeworld and Homeworld 2, as well as at least one (unlicensed) independent project to develop a standalone game. The only finished work as yet though is the free and standalone game &quot;The Babylon Project&quot; based on the [[FreeSpace 2 Source Code Project]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gameshark.com/pc/features/549/Monthly-Mod-Focus-The-Babylon-Project.htm |title=The Babylon Project |accessdate=2008-12-15|author=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''BeOS''' is an [[operating system]] for [[personal computer]]s which began development by [[Be Inc.]] in 1991. It was first written to run on [[BeBox]] hardware. BeOS was optimized for digital media work and was written to take advantage of modern hardware facilities such as [[symmetric multiprocessing]] by utilizing modular I/O bandwidth, pervasive multithreading, [[preemptive multitasking]] and a custom [[64-bit]] [[journaling file system]] known as [[Be File System|BFS]]. The BeOS GUI was developed on the principles of clarity and a clean, uncluttered design. It used [[Unicode]] as the default encoding in the GUI, yet support for input methods, such as bidirectional input was never realized. The [[application programming interface|API]] was written in [[C++]] for ease of programming. It has partial [[POSIX]] compatibility and access to a [[command-line interface]] through [[Bash (Unix shell)|Bash]], although internally it is not a Unix-derived operating system.

BeOS was positioned as a multimedia platform which could be used by a substantial population of desktop users and a competitor to [[Mac OS]] and [[Microsoft Windows]]. However, it was ultimately unable to achieve a significant market share and proved commercially unviable for Be Inc. The company was acquired by [[Palm Inc.]] and today BeOS is mainly used and developed by a small population of enthusiasts.

The open-source OS [[Haiku (operating system)|Haiku]] is designed to start up where BeOS left off. Alpha 2 of Haiku was released in May 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.haiku-os.org/news/2010-05-10_haiku_project_announces_availability_haiku_r1alpha_2 |title=Haiku Project Announces Availability of Haiku R1/Alpha 2 |date=May 9, 2010 |work=Haiku-OS.org }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Initially designed to run on [[AT&amp;T Hobbit]]-based hardware, BeOS was later modified to run on [[PowerPC]]-based processors: first Be's own systems, later [[Apple Inc.]]'s [[PowerPC Reference Platform]] and [[Common Hardware Reference Platform]], with the hope that Apple would purchase or license BeOS as a replacement for its then aging [[Mac OS#&quot;Classic&quot; Mac OS (1984–2001)|Mac OS Classic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://macreate.net/reloaded/?q=node/view/149  | title=BeOS @ MaCreate | date=2004-11-24 | author=Tom | accessdate=2006-11-16 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20050324220739/http://macreate.net/reloaded/?q=node/view/149 |archivedate = 2005-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apple CEO [[Gil Amelio]] started negotiations to buy Be Inc., but negotiations stalled when Be CEO [[Jean-Louis Gassée]] wanted $200 million; Apple was unwilling to offer any more than $125 million. Apple's board of directors decided [[NeXTSTEP]] was a better choice and purchased [[NeXT]] in 1996 for $429 million, bringing back Apple co-founder [[Steve Jobs]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://macspeedzone.com/archive/art/con/be.shtml Apple Confidential: The Day They Almost Decided To Put Windows NT On The Mac Instead Of OS X!]&lt;/ref&gt; To further complicate matters for Be, Apple refused to disclose certain architectural information about its [[PowerPC G3|G3]] line of computers&amp;mdash;information Be deemed critical to making BeOS work on the latest Apple hardware.

In 1997, [[Power Computing]] began bundling BeOS (on a CD for optional installation) with its line of PowerPC-based [[Macintosh clone]]s. These systems could [[dual boot]] either the [[Mac OS]] or BeOS, with a start-up screen offering the choice.

Due to Apple's moves and the mounting debt of Be Inc., BeOS was soon ported to the [[X86 architecture|Intel x86]] platform with its R3 release in March 1998. Through the late 1990s, BeOS managed to create a niche of followers, but the company failed to remain viable. As a last-ditch effort to increase interest in the failing operating system, Be Inc. released a stripped-down, but free, copy of [[BeOS R5]] known as BeOS Personal Edition (BeOS PE). BeOS PE could be started from within [[Microsoft Windows]] or [[Linux]], and was intended to nurture consumer interest in its product and give developers something to tinker with.

Be Inc. also released a stripped-down version of BeOS for Internet Appliances ([[BeIA]]), which soon became the company's business focus in place of BeOS. BeOS PE and BeIA proved to be too little too late, and in 2001 Be's copyrights were sold to [[Palm, Inc.]] for some $11 million. BeOS R5 is considered the last official version, but BeOS R5.1 &quot;[[Dano (BeOS)|Dano]]&quot;, which was under development before Be's sale to Palm and included the [[BeOS Networking Environment]] (BONE) networking stack, was leaked to the public shortly after the company's demise.

In 2002, Be Inc. sued&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2002/02/20/be_inc_sues_microsoft/ | title=Be Inc. sues Microsoft | date=2002-02-20 | author=Andrew Orlowski| accessdate=2008-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microsoft claiming that [[Hitachi]] had been dissuaded from selling PCs loaded with BeOS, and that [[Compaq]] had been pressured to not market an Internet appliance in partnership with Be. BeOS also claimed that Microsoft acted to artificially depress Be Inc.'s [[initial public offering]] (IPO). The case was eventually settled out of court&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.internetnews.com/ent-news/print.php/3073811/ | title=Microsoft Settles Anti-Trust Charges with Be | date=2003-09-08 | author=Mark Berniker| accessdate=2008-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; for $23.25 million with no admission of liability on Microsoft's part.

After the split from Palm, [[PalmSource]] used parts of BeOS' multimedia framework for their failed [[Palm OS#Palm OS Cobalt|Palm OS Cobalt]] product.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.access-company.com/news/press/PalmSource/2004/021004_cobalt.html PalmSource Introduces Palm OS Cobalt], PalmSource press release, 10 February 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; With the takeover of PalmSource, the BeOS rights now belong to [[Access Co.]]

===Continuation===
Despite the end of Be Inc., BeOS has devoted followers. The BeOS community still develops free software and has even released patches, drivers and various updates to BeOS. The main source of BeOS-related software can be found at BeBits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=BeBits&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; The Best Source of BeOS Software | url=http://www.bebits.com | accessdate=2006-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The BeOS user interface was notable at the time for being almost completely [[theme (computing)|unthemeable]], even with third party hacks. The BeOS theme of yellow, changing length [[tab (GUI)|tab]]s on the top of windows, and relatively plain grey interface [[widget (computing)|widget]]s was enforced. This UI remained relatively unchanged from 1995, but had been completely overhauled by the time of the leaked ''Dano'' release. An [[Easter egg (virtual)|Easter egg]] in the OS allowed changing the title bar look-and-feel to a few others (Mac OS 8, [[Workbench (AmigaOS)|Amiga Workbench]], and [[Windows 98]] appearances) and in ''Dano'', this had been extended to be a feature allowing changing of the title bar and scroll bars. No other interface widgets could be changed. There is a pre-Dano third party program WindowShade that allows the colors of the title bar and window frame to be changed, but the appearance remained the same.

The plain BeOS R5 GUI is commonly cloned, for example with themes for the [[GNOME]] or [[KDE]] desktop environment.

== Projects to recreate BeOS ==
BeOS was well respected by a small but loyal user base, which was disappointed when Be Inc. failed commercially and no further enhancement of the operating system would be possible. In the years that followed a handful of projects formed to recreate BeOS or key elements of the OS with the eventual goal of then continuing where Be Inc. left off. To ensure that the OS could not be &quot;taken away&quot; from the Be community again, and to attract the efforts of volunteer programmers, these projects were all [[free and open source software]]. The modular nature of the original BeOS facilitated recreating the operating system a piece at a time, inserting the newly coded modules into a working BeOS system to test compatibility. Eventually, all of the &quot;servers&quot; (interworking modules of code) were to be replaced with original, freely licensed code.

Within a few years, some of these projects lost momentum and were discontinued. The Blue Eyed Os website is back online after being missing for 2 years but hasn't had a release since 2003, the most recent release available on the Cosmoe web site is from 2004 and active development on [[E/OS]] ended in July 2008, BeOS Workstation picked up where Be. Inc left off but that too seems to be dead as well. Development however continues on [[Haiku (operating system)|Haiku]], a complete reimplementation of BeOS. The first alpha release, &quot;Haiku R1 / Alpha 1&quot;, was released on September 14, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haiku-os.org/news/2009-09-13_haiku_project_announces_availability_haiku_r1alpha_1|title=Haiku Project Announces Availability of Haiku R1/Alpha 1|date=2009-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second alpha release, &quot;Haiku R1 / Alpha 2&quot;, was made available on May 9, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haiku-os.org/news/2010-05-10_haiku_project_announces_availability_haiku_r1alpha_2|title=Haiku Project Announces Availability of Haiku R1/Alpha 2|date=2010-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Projects to continue BeOS ==
[[Magnussoft ZETA|ZETA]] was a commercially available operating system based on the BeOS R5.1 codebase. Originally developed by [[YellowTAB]], the operating system was then distributed by [[magnussoft]]. During the development by YellowTAB, the company received criticism from the BeOS community for refusing to discuss their legal position with regard to the BeOS code-base (perhaps for contractual reasons). [[Access Co.]] (which bought [[PalmSource]], until then, the holders of the intellectual property associated with BeOS) has since declared that YellowTAB had no right to distribute a modified version of BeOS, and magnussoft has ceased distribution of the operating system.

== Products using BeOS ==
BeOS (and now Zeta) continue to be used in media appliances such as the Edirol DV-7 video editors from [[Roland corporation]] which run on top of a modified BeOS&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.edirol.com/products/dv7dl/index.html | title=EDIROL by Roland DV-7DL Series Digital Video Workstations | accessdate=2006-11-16 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061110070209/http://www.edirol.com/products/dv7dl/index.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the TuneTracker radio automation software that runs on BeOS and Zeta, but is also sold as a &quot;Station-in-a-Box&quot; with the Zeta operating system included.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tunetrackersystems.com/products.html | title=TuneTracker Radio Automation Software | accessdate=2006-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tascam SX-1 digital audio recorder runs a heavily modified version of BeOS that will only launch the recording interface software.

iZ Technology sells the [[RADAR (audio recorder)|RADAR 24 and RADAR V]], hard disk-based, 24-track professional audio recorders based on BeOS 5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://mixonline.com/mag/audio_iz_radar/ | title=iZ RADAR 24 | accessdate=2006-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Magicbox, a manufacturer of signage and broadcast display machines, uses BeOS to power their [[Aavelin]] product line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://digitalcontentproducer.com/digitalsign/depth/digital_signage_hardware_05012006/ | title=Technology Showcase: Digital Signage Hardware | author=Jay Ankeney | date=2006-05-01 | publisher=Digital Content Producer | accessdate=2006-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Final Scratch]], the 12″ vinyl timecode record-driven DJ software/hardware system, was first developed on BeOS. The &quot;ProFS&quot; version was sold to a few dozen DJs prior to the 1.0 release, which ran on a Linux virtual partition.

'''Biomes'''   are [[climatic]]ally and [[geographical]]ly defined as similar climatic conditions on the [[Earth]], such as [[Community (ecology)|communities]] of [[plant]]s, [[animal]]s, and [[Soil biology|soil organisms]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/exhibits/biomes/index.php The World's Biomes], Retrieved August 19, 2008, from [http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/index.php University of California Museum of Paleontology]&lt;/ref&gt; and are often referred to as [[ecosystems]]. Some parts of the earth have more or less the same kind of abiotic and biotic factors spread over a large area creating a typical ecosystem over that area. Such major ecosystems are termed as biomes. Biomes are defined by factors such as plant structures (such as [[trees]], [[shrubs]], and [[grasses]]), leaf types (such as [[broadleaf]] and needleleaf), plant spacing ([[forest]], [[woodland]], [[savanna]]), and climate. Unlike [[ecozone]]s, biomes are not defined by genetic, taxonomic, or historical similarities. Biomes are often identified with particular patterns of [[ecological succession]] and [[climax vegetation]] (quasi-equilibrium state of the local ecosystem). An [[ecosystem]] has many [[biotope]]s and a biome is a major [[habitat]] type. A major habitat type, however, is a compromise, as it has an intrinsic [[Homogeneity (ecology)|inhomogeneity]].

The [[biodiversity]] characteristic of each biome, especially the diversity of fauna and subdominant plant forms, is a function of [[abiotic]] factors and the [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]] productivity of the dominant [[vegetation]]. In terrestrial biomes, species diversity tends to correlate positively with [[primary production|net primary productivity]], [[Ecohydrology|moisture availability]], and [[temperature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last = Pidwirny | first = Michael| editor = Sidney Draggan | encyclopedia = Encyclopedia of Earth | title = Biomes | url = http://www.eoearth.org/article/Biomes | accessdate = 2006-11-16 | edition =  | date = 2006-10-16 | publisher = Environmental Information Coalition, National Council for Science and the Environment | location = Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Ecoregions]] are grouped into both biomes and ecozones.

A fundamental classification of biomes is:

# Aquatic biomes (including Freshwater biomes and Marine biomes)
     
Biomes are often known in English by local names. For example, a [[temperate grasslands, savannas, and shrublands|temperate grassland or shrubland]] biome is known commonly as ''[[steppe]]'' in central [[Asia]], ''[[prairie]]'' in [[North America]], and ''[[pampas]]'' in [[South America]]. Tropical grasslands are known as ''[[savanna]]'' in Australia, whereas in Southern Africa it is known as certain kinds of ''[[veld]]'' (from [[Afrikaans]]). 

Sometimes an entire biome may be targeted for protection, especially under an individual nation's [[Biodiversity Action Plan]].

Climate is a major factor determining the distribution of terrestrial biomes. Among the important climatic factors are:
* [[latitude]]: Arctic, boreal, temperate, subtropical, tropical.
* [[humidity]]: humid, semi-humid, semi-arid, and arid.
** seasonal variation: Rainfall may be distributed evenly throughout the year or be marked by seasonal variations.
** dry summer, wet winter: Most regions of the earth receive most of their rainfall during the summer months; Mediterranean climate regions receive their rainfall during the winter months.
* [[elevation]]: Increasing elevation causes a distribution of habitat types similar to that of increasing latitude.

The most widely used systems of classifying biomes correspond to [[latitude]] (or temperature zoning) and humidity. [[Biodiversity]] generally increases away from the poles towards the [[equator]] and increases with humidity.

==Biome Classification Schemes==

Biome classification schemes seek to define biomes using climatic measurements. Particularly in the 1970s and 1980s there was a significant push to understand the relationships between these measurements and properties of ecosystem energetics because such discoveries would enable the prediction of rates of energy capture and transfer among components within ecosystems. Such a study was conducted by Sims et al. (1978) on North American grasslands. The study found a positive logistic correlation between [[evapotranspiration]] in mm/yr and above ground net primary production in g/m^2/yr. More general results from the study were that precipitation and water use lead to aboveground primary production, solar radiation and temperature lead to belowground primary production (roots), and temperature and water lead to cool and warm season growth habit.&lt;ref&gt;Pomeroy, Lawrence R. and James J. Alberts, editors. Concepts of Ecosystem Ecology. New York: Springer-Verlag, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;  These findings help explain the categories used in Holdridge’s bioclassification scheme, which were then later simplified in Whittaker’s. The number of classification schemes and the variety of determinants used in those schemes, however, should be taken as a strong indicator that biomes do not all fit perfectly into the classification schemes created.

===Holdridge Scheme===
The Holdridge classification scheme was developed by L. R. Holdridge, a [[botanist]]. It maps climates based on four categories:
*Average total precipitation (cm) on a logarithmic scale
*Potential evapotranspiration ratio: the potential evapotranspiration divided by the precipitation; the ratio increases from humid to arid regions.
*Potential [[evapotranspiration]]
*Mean annual biotemperature (°C): calculated from monthly mean temperatures after converting any mean temperature to 0°C, based on the assumption that temperatures at or below freezing all have the same effect on plants, and delineating between -10°C and -30°C would yield unrealistic results.

In this scheme, climates are classified based on the biological effects of temperature and rainfall on vegetation under the assumption that these two [[abiotic]] factors are the largest determinants of the type of vegetation found in an area. Holdridge uses the 4 axis to define 30 so called &quot;humidity provinces,&quot; which are clearly visible in the Holdridge diagram. While the scheme largely ignores soil and sun exposure, Holdridge did acknowledge that these, too, were important factors in biome determination.

===Whittaker's Biome-type Classification Scheme===

[[Robert Harding Whittaker|Whittaker]] appreciated biome-types as a representation of the great diversity of the living world, and saw the need to establish a simple way to classify these biome-types. Whittaker based his classification scheme on two abiotic factors: Precipitation and Temperature. His scheme can be seen as a simplification of Holdridge's, one more readily accessible, but perhaps missing the greater specificity that Holdrige's provides. 

Whittaker based his representation of global biomes on both previous theoretical assertions as well as an ever increasing empirical sampling of global ecosystems. Whittaker was in a unique position to make such a holistic assertion as he had previously compiled a review of biome classification.&lt;ref&gt;Whittaker, Robert H., Botanical Review, Classification of Natural Communities, Vol. 28, No. 1 (Jan-Mar 1962), pp. 1-239.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Whittaker Classification Scheme can be viewed at the following address: [http://www.marietta.edu/~biol/biomes/images/woodland/whittaker_v2.jpg here]

====Key definitions for understanding Whittaker's Scheme====

*'''physiognomy''': The apparent characteristics, outward features, or appearance of ecological communities or species.
*'''biome''': a grouping of terrestrial ecosystems on a given continent that are similar in vegetation structure, physiognomy, features of the environment and characteristics of their animal communities
*'''formation''': a major kind of community of plants on a given continent
*'''biome-type''': grouping of convergent biomes or formations of different continents; defined by physiognomy
*'''formation-type''': grouping of convergent formations

Whittaker's distinction between biome and formation can be simplified: formation is used when applied to plant communities only, while biome is used when concerned with both plants and animals. Whittaker's convention of biome-type or formation-type is simply a broader method to categorize similar communities.&lt;ref&gt;Whittaker, Robert H. Communities and Ecosystems New York: MacMillan Publishing Company, Inc., 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; The world biome-types, as displayed on a world map, can be viewed at the following link: [http://www.marietta.edu/~biol/biomes/biomemap.html here]

====Whittaker's parameters for classifying biome-types====

Whittaker, seeing the need for a simpler way to express the relationship of community structure to the environment, used what he called “gradient analysis” of ecocline patterns to relate communities to climate on a worldwide scale. Whittaker considered four main ecoclines in the terrestrial realm.&lt;ref&gt;Whittaker, Robert H. Communities and Ecosystems New York: MacMillan Publishing Company, Inc., 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Intertidal levels: The wetness gradient of areas that are exposed to alternating water and dryness with intensities that vary by location from high to low tide
# climatic moisture gradient
# temperature gradient by altitude
# temperature gradient by latitude

Along these gradients, Whittaker noted several trends that allow him to qualitatively establish biome-types. 
* The gradient runs from favorable to extreme with corresponding changes in productivity.
* Changes in physiognomic complexity vary with the favorability of the environment (decreasing community structure and reduction of stratal differentiation as the environment becomes less favorable).
* Trends in diversity of structure follow trends in species diversity; alpha and beta species diversities decrease from favorable to extreme environments.
* Each growth-form (i.e. grasses, shrubs, etc.) has its characteristic place of maximum importance along the ecoclines.
*The same growth forms may be dominant in similar environments in widely different parts of the world.

Whittaker summed the effects of gradients (3) and (4), to get an overall temperature gradient and combined this with gradient (2), the moisture gradient, to express the above conclusions in what is known as the Whittaker Classification Scheme. The scheme graphs average annual precipitation (x-axis) versus average annual temperature (y-axis) to classify biome-types.

=== Walter System ===

The Heinrich Walter classification scheme was developed by Heinrich Walter, a German ecologist. It differs from both the Whittaker and Holdridge schemes because it takes into account the seasonality of temperature and precipitation. The system, also based on precipitation and temperature, finds 9 major biomes, with the important climate traits and vegetation types summarized in the accompanying table. The boundaries of each biome correlate to the conditions of moisture and cold stress that are strong determinants of plant form, and therefore the vegetation that defines the region.

*I: Equatorial
**Always moist and lacking temperature seasonality
**Evergreen tropical rain forest
*II: Tropical
**Summer rainy season and cooler “winter” dry season
**Seasonal forest, scrub, or savanna
*III: Subtropical
**Highly seasonal, arid climate
**Desert vegetation with considerable exposed surface
*IV: Mediterranean
**Winter rainy season and summer drought
**Sclerophyllous (drought-adapted), frost-sensitive shrublands and woodlands
*V: Warm temperate
**Occasional frost, often with summer rainfall maximum
**Temperate evergreen forest, somewhat frost-sensitive
*VI: Nemoral
**Moderate climate with winter freezing
**Frost-resistant, deciduous, temperate forest
*VII: Continental
**Arid, with warm or hot summers and cold winters
**Grasslands and temperate deserts
*VIII: Boreal
**Cold temperate with cool summers and long winters
**Evergreen, frost-hardy needle-leaved forest (taiga)
*IX: Polar
**Very short, cool summers and long, very cold winters
**Low, evergreen vegetation, without trees, growing over permanently frozen soils

===Bailey System===

Robert G. Bailey almost developed a [[biogeography|biogeographical]] classification system for the United States in a map published in 1976. Bailey subsequently expanded the system to include the rest of South America in 1981 and the world in 1989. The Bailey system is based on climate and is divided into seven domains (Polar, Humid Temperate, Dry, Human, and Humid Tropical), with further divisions based on other climate characteristics (subarctic, warm temperate, hot temperate, and subtropical; marine and continental; lowland and mountain).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fs.fed.us/land/ecosysmgmt/index.html Bailey System, US Forest Service&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''100 Polar Domain'''
** 120 Tundra Division
** M120 Tundra Division - Mountain Provinces
** 130 Subarctic Division
** M130 Subarctic Division - Mountain Provinces
* '''200 Humid Temperate Domain'''
** 210 Warm Continental Division
** M210 Warm Continental Division - Mountain Provinces
** 220 Hot Continental Division

** M310 Tropical/Subtropical Steppe Division - Mountain Provinces

===WWF system===
A team of biologists convened by the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] (WWF) developed an [[ecological land classification]] system that identified fourteen biomes,&lt;ref&gt;Olson, David M. et al. (2001); [http://www.csrc.sr.unh.edu/~palace/cerrado/olson%20et%20al.%20%28world%20veg%20map%29.pdf Terrestrial Ecoregions of the World]: A New Map of Life on Earth, BioScience, Vol. 51, No. 11., pp. 933-938.&lt;/ref&gt; called '''major habitat types''', and further divided the world's land area into 867 [[terrestrial ecoregions]]. Each terrestrial Ecoregion has a specific EcoID, fomat XXnnNN (XX is the [[Ecozone]], nn is the Biome number, NN is the individual number). This classification is used to define the [[Global 200]] list of [[ecoregion]]s identified by the WWF as priorities for conservation. The WWF major habitat types are: 

*01 [[Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests]] (tropical and subtropical, humid)
*02 [[Tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests]] (tropical and subtropical, semi-humid)
*03 [[Tropical and subtropical coniferous forests]] (tropical and subtropical, semi-humid)
*04 [[Temperate broadleaf and mixed forests]] (temperate, humid)
*05 [[Temperate coniferous forests]] (temperate, humid to semi-humid)
*06 [[Taiga|Boreal forests/taiga]] (subarctic, humid)
*07 [[Tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas, and shrublands]] (tropical and subtropical, semi-arid)
*08 [[Temperate grasslands, savannas, and shrublands]] (temperate, semi-arid)
*09 [[Flooded grasslands and savannas]] (temperate to tropical, fresh or brackish water inundated)
*10 [[Montane grasslands and shrublands]] (alpine or montane climate)
*11 [[Tundra]] (Arctic)
*12 [[Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub]] or [[Sclerophyll forest]]s (temperate warm, semi-humid to semi-arid with winter rainfall)
*13 [[Deserts and xeric shrublands]] (temperate to tropical, arid)
*14 [[Mangrove]] (subtropical and tropical, salt water inundated)

====Freshwater biomes====

==Anthropogenic biomes==
Humans have fundamentally altered global patterns of biodiversity and ecosystem processes. As a result, vegetation forms predicted by conventional biome systems are rarely observed across most of Earth's land surface. [[Anthropogenic biomes]] provide an alternative view of the terrestrial biosphere based on global patterns of sustained direct human interaction with ecosystems, including agriculture, human settlements, urbanization, forestry and other uses of land. Anthropogenic biomes offer a new way forward in ecology and conservation by recognizing the irreversible coupling of human and ecological systems at global scales and moving us toward an understanding how best to live in and manage our biosphere and the anthropogenic biosphere we live in. The main biomes in the world are freshwater, marine, coniferous, deciduous, ice, mountains, boreal, grasslands, tundra, and rainforests.

===Major Anthropogenic Biomes===
* Dense Settlements
* Villages
* Croplands
* Rangelands
* Forested

==Other biomes==
The [[Endolith]]ic biome, consisting entirely of microscopic life in rock [[porosity|pores]] and cracks, kilometers beneath the surface, has only recently been discovered and does not fit well into most classification schemes.

'''Behaviour''' or '''behavior''' (see [[American and British English spelling differences#-our,_-or|American and British spelling differences]]) refers to the actions of a [[system]] or [[organism]], usually in relation to its environment, which includes the other systems or organisms around as well as the physical environment. It is the response of the system or organism to various stimuli or inputs, whether [[internal]] or [[external]], [[conscious]] or [[subconscious]], [[overt]] or [[covert]], and [[voluntary]] or [[involuntary]].

==Biology==
In humans, behavior is believed to be controlled primarily by the [[endocrine system]] and the [[nervous system]]. It is most commonly believed that complexity in the behavior of an organism is correlated to the complexity of its nervous system. Generally, organisms with more complex nervous systems have a greater capacity to [[learn]] new responses and thus adjust their behavior. 

Behaviors can be either [[innate]] or learned. However, current research in the [[Human Microbiome Project]] points towards a possibility that human behavior may be controlled by the composition of the microbe population within a human body.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6WC1-4WD1BY7-1&amp;_user=2030552&amp;_coverDate=01%2F31%2F2010&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=high&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_searchStrId=1356219447&amp;_rerunOrigin=google&amp;_acct=C000055860&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=2030552&amp;md5=aa2deffba3b102da34fd76fb46e71731 Mood and gut feelings at ScienceDirect]&lt;/ref&gt;

More generally, behavior can be regarded as any action of an organism that changes its relationship to its environment. Behavior provides outputs from the organism to the environment.&lt;ref&gt;Dusenbery, David B. (2009). ''Living at Micro Scale'', p. 124. Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Mass. ISBN 978-0-674-03116-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychology==
[[Human behavior]] (and that of other [[organism]]s and mechanisms) can be common, unusual, acceptable, or [[deviant behavior|unacceptable]]. Humans evaluate the [[taboo|acceptability]] of behavior using [[social norm]]s and regulate behavior by means of [[social control]]. In [[sociology]], behavior is considered as having no meaning, being not directed at other people and thus is the most basic human [[action (philosophy)|action]], although it can play a part in diagnosis of disorders such as the [[autism]] [[spectrum disorders]]. Animal behavior is studied in [[comparative psychology]], [[ethology]], [[behavioral ecology]] and [[sociobiology]]. According to moral values, human behavior may also depend upon the common, usual, unusual, acceptable or unacceptable behavior of others.

Behavior became an important construct in early 20th century [[psychology]] with the advent of the paradigm known subsequently as &quot;[[behaviorism]].&quot; Behaviorism was a reaction against &quot;faculty&quot; psychology which purported to see into or understand the mind without the benefit of scientific testing. Behaviorism insisted on working only with what can be seen or manipulated and in the early views of [[John B. Watson]], a founder of the field, nothing was inferred as to the nature of the entity that produced the behavior. Subsequent modifications of Watson's perspective and that of &quot;[[classical conditioning]]&quot; (see under [[Ivan Pavlov]]) led to the rise of [[operant conditioning]] or &quot;radical behaviorism,&quot; a theory advocated by [[B.F. Skinner]], which took over the academic establishment up through the 1950s and was synonymous with &quot;behaviorism&quot; for many.

For studies on behavior, [[ethogram]]s are used.

==Other fields==
Behavior outside of psychology includes [[physical property]] and [[chemical reactions]].

===Computer science===
Behavior as used in [[computer science]] is an anthropomorphic construct that assigns &quot;life&quot; to the activities carried out by a computer, computer application, or computer code in response to stimuli, such as user input. Also, &quot;a behavior&quot; is a reusable block of computer code or script that, when applied to an [[object (computer science)|object]], especially a graphical one, causes it to respond to user input in meaningful patterns or to operate independently. Also, behavior is a value that changes over time&lt;ref&gt;[http://flapjax-lang.org/tutorial/ Flapjax tutorial]&lt;/ref&gt; (one of the key concepts in [[functional reactive programming]]). The term can also be applied to some degree to [[function (mathematics)|functions]] in mathematics, referring to the anatomy of [[curve]]s.

===Earth sciences===
In environmental [[environmental science|modeling]] and especially in [[hydrology]], a '''behavioral model''' means a model that is acceptably [[consistent]] with observed natural processes, i.e., that [[simulation|simulates]] well, for example, observed [[discharge (hydrology)|river discharge]]. It is a key concept of the so-called Generalized Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation ([[GLUE (uncertainty assessment)|GLUE]]) methodology to quantify how uncertain environmental [[predictions]] are.

{{Campaignbox First Persian invasion of Greece}}
The '''Battle of [[Marathon, Greece|Marathon]]''' ({{lang-el|Μάχη τοῦ Μαραθῶνος}}, ''Machē tou Marathōnos'') took place in 490 BC, during the [[first Persian invasion of Greece]]. It was fought between the citizens of [[History of Athens|Athens]], aided by [[Plataea]], and a [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] force commanded by [[Datis]] and [[Artaphernes (son of Artaphernes)|Artaphernes]]. It was the culmination of the first attempt by Persia, under King [[Darius I of Persia|Darius I]], to subjugate [[Ancient Greece|Greece]]. The first Persian invasion was a response to Greek involvement in the [[Ionian Revolt]], when Athens and [[Eretria]] had sent a force to support the cities of [[Ionia]] in their attempt to overthrow Persian rule. The Athenians and Eretrians had succeeded in capturing and burning [[Sardis]], but were then forced to retreat with heavy losses. In response to this raid, Darius swore to burn down Athens and Eretria. At the time of the battle, Sparta and Athens were the two largest city states.

Once the Ionian revolt was finally crushed by the Persian victory at the [[Battle of Lade]], Darius began to plan to subjugate Greece. In 490 BC, he sent a naval task force under Datis and Artaphernes across the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]], to subjugate the [[Cyclades]], and then to make punitive attacks on Athens and Eretria. Reaching [[Euboea]] in mid-summer after a successful campaign in the Aegean, the Persians proceeded to besiege and capture Eretria. The Persian force then sailed for Attica, landing in the bay near the town of Marathon. The Athenians, joined by a small force from [[Plataea]], marched to Marathon, and succeeded in blocking the two exits from the plain of Marathon. Stalemate ensued for five days, before the Athenians decided to attack the Persians because, under the cover of night, some of the Persian fleet had set sail for Athens. Despite the numerical advantage of the Persians, the hoplites proved devastatingly effective against the more lightly armed Persian infantry, routing the wings before turning in on the centre of the Persian line.

The defeat at Marathon marked the end of the first Persian invasion of Greece, and the Persian force retreated to Asia. Darius then began raising a huge new army with which he meant to completely subjugate Greece; however, in 486 BC, his [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] subjects revolted, indefinitely postponing any Greek expedition. After Darius died, his son [[Xerxes I]] re-started the preparations for a [[Second Persian invasion of Greece|second invasion of Greece]], which finally began in 480 BC.

The Battle of Marathon was a watershed in the Greco-Persian wars, showing the Greeks that the Persians could be beaten; the eventual Greek triumph in these wars can be seen to begin at Marathon. Since the following two hundred years saw the rise of the [[Classical Greece|Classical Greek]] civilization, which has been enduringly influential in western society, the Battle of Marathon is often seen as a pivotal moment in European history. For instance, [[John Stuart Mill]] famously suggested that &quot;the Battle of Marathon, even as an event in British history, is more important than the [[Battle of Hastings]]&quot;. The Battle of Marathon is perhaps now more famous as the inspiration for the [[Marathon]] race. Although historically inaccurate, the legend of a Greek messenger running to Athens with news of the victory became the inspiration for this athletic event, introduced at the 1896 Athens Olympics, and originally run between Marathon and Athens.

== Sources ==
{{Main|Herodotus}}

The main source for the Greco-Persian Wars is the Greek historian [[Herodotus]]. Herodotus, who has been called the 'Father of History',&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, On the Laws I, 5&lt;/ref&gt; was born in 484 BC in Halicarnassus, Asia Minor (then under Persian overlordship). He wrote his 'Enquiries' (Greek—''Historia''; English—''[[Histories (Herodotus)|(The) Histories]]'') around 440–430 BC, trying to trace the origins of the Greco-Persian Wars, which would still have been relatively recent history (the wars finally ending in 450 BC).&lt;ref name = hxvi/&gt; Herodotus's approach was entirely novel, and at least in Western society, he does seem to have invented 'history' as we know it.&lt;ref name = hxvi/&gt; As Holland has it: &quot;For the first time, a chronicler set himself to trace the origins of a conflict not to a past so remote so as to be utterly fabulous, nor to the whims and wishes of some god, nor to a people's claim to manifest destiny, but rather explanations he could verify personally.&quot;&lt;ref name = hxvi&gt;Holland, pp. ''xvi''–''xvii''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many changes that were subsequent with ancient historians, despite following in his footsteps, criticised Herodotus, starting with [[Thucydides]].&lt;ref&gt;Thucydides, History of the Peloponnesian War, e.g. [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0200&amp;layout=&amp;loc=1.22 I, 22]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Fin15&gt;Finley, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Thucydides chose to begin his history where Herodotus left off (at the [[Siege of Sestos]]), and may therefore have felt that Herodotus's history was accurate enough not to need re-writing or correcting.&lt;ref name = Fin15/&gt; [[Plutarch]] criticised Herodotus in his essay &quot;On The Malignity of Herodotus&quot;, describing Herodotus as &quot;''Philobarbaros''&quot; (barbarian-lover), for not being pro-Greek enough, which suggests that Herodotus might actually have done a reasonable job of being even-handed.&lt;ref&gt;Holland, p. ''xxiv''.&lt;/ref&gt; A negative view of Herodotus was passed on to Renaissance Europe, though he remained well read.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.loyno.edu/history/journal/1998-9/Pipes.htm|title=Herodotus: Father of History, Father of Lies|accessdate=2008-01-18|author=David Pipes|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080127105636/http://www.loyno.edu/history/journal/1998-9/Pipes.htm |archivedate = January 27, 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, since the 19th century his reputation has been dramatically rehabilitated by archaeological finds which have repeatedly confirmed his version of events.&lt;ref name = h377&gt;Holland, p. 377.&lt;/ref&gt; The prevailing modern view is that Herodotus generally did a remarkable job in his ''Historia'', but that some of his specific details (particularly troop numbers and dates) should be viewed with skepticism.&lt;ref name = h377/&gt; Nevertheless, there are still some historians who believe Herodotus made up much of his story.&lt;ref&gt;Fehling, pp. 1–277.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sicilian historian [[Diodorus Siculus]], writing in the 1st century BC in his ''[[Bibliotheca historica|Bibliotheca Historica]]'', also provides an account of the Greco-Persian wars, partially derived from the earlier Greek historian [[Ephorus]]. This account is fairly consistent with Herodotus's.&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus Siculus, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0084&amp;layout=&amp;loc=11.28 Bibliotheca Historica]&lt;/ref&gt; The Greco-Persian wars are also described in less detail by a number of other ancient historians including Plutarch, [[Ctesias of Cnidus]], and are alluded by other authors, such as the playwright [[Aeschylus]]. Archaeological evidence, such as the [[Serpent Column]], also supports some of Herodotus's specific claims.&lt;ref&gt;Note to Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&amp;layout=&amp;loc=9.81.1 IX, 81]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Map Greco-Persian Wars-en.svg|thumb|300px|right|A map showing the Greek world at the time of the battle]]

The first Persian invasion of Greece had its immediate roots in the [[Ionian Revolt]], the earliest phase of the [[Greco-Persian Wars]]. However, it was also the result of the longer-term interaction between the Greeks and Persians. In 500 BC the Persian Empire was still relatively young and highly expansionistic, but prone to revolts amongst its subject peoples.&lt;ref name = h47&gt;Holland, p47–55&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = h58&gt;Holland, p58–62&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;h203&quot;/&gt; Moreover, the Persian king Darius was a usurper, and had spent considerable time extinguishing revolts against his rule.&lt;ref name = h47/&gt; Even before the Ionian Revolt, Darius had begun to expand the Empire into Europe, subjugating [[Thrace]], and forcing Macedon to become allied to Persia. Attempts at further expansion into the politically fractious world of Ancient Greece may have been inevitable.&lt;ref name = h58/&gt; However, the Ionian Revolt had directly threatened the integrity of the Persian empire, and the states of mainland Greece remained a potential menace to its future stability.&lt;ref name = h171&gt;Holland, 171–178&lt;/ref&gt; Darius thus resolved to subjugate and pacify Greece and the Aegean, and to punish those involved in the Ionian Revolt.&lt;ref name = h171/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&amp;layout=&amp;loc=5.105 V, 105]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ionian revolt had begun with an unsuccessful [[Siege of Naxos (499 BC)|expedition]] against [[Naxos (island)|Naxos]], a joint venture between the Persian satrap [[Artaphernes]] and the [[Miletus|Milesian]] tyrant [[Aristagoras]].&lt;ref name = h154&gt;Holland, p154–157&lt;/ref&gt; In the aftermath, Artaphernes decided to remove Aristagoras from power, but before he could do so, Aristagoras abdicated, and declared Miletus a democracy.&lt;ref name = h154/&gt; The other [[Ionia]]n cities followed suit, ejecting their Persian-appointed tyrants, and  declaring themselves democracies.&lt;ref name = h154/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&amp;layout=&amp;loc=5.98 V, 97]&lt;/ref&gt; Artistagoras then appealed to the states of Mainland Greece for support, but only [[History of Athens|Athens]] and [[Eretria]] offered to send troops.&lt;ref name = h157&gt;Holland, p157–161&lt;/ref&gt; 

The involvement of Athens in the Ionian Revolt arose from a complex set of circumstances, beginning with the establishment of the [[Athenian Democracy]] in the late 6th century BC.&lt;ref name = h157/&gt;
In 510 BC, with the aid of [[Cleomenes I]], King of [[Sparta]], the Athenian people had expelled [[Hippias (tyrant)|Hippias]], the [[tyrant]] ruler of Athens.&lt;ref name = V65&gt;Herodotus  [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&amp;layout=&amp;loc=5.65 V, 65]&lt;/ref&gt; With Hippias's father [[Peisistratos (Athens)|Peisistratus]], the family had ruled for 36 out of the previous 50 years and fully intended to continue Hippias's rule.&lt;ref name = V65/&gt; Hippias fled to [[Sardis]] to the court of the Persian [[satrap]], [[Artaphernes]] and promised control of Athens to the Persians if they were to help restore him.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&amp;layout=&amp;loc=5.97 V, 96]&lt;/ref&gt; In the meantime, Cleomenes helped install a pro-Spartan tyranny under [[Isagoras]] in Athens, in opposition to [[Cleisthenes]], the leader of the traditionally powerful [[Alcmaeonidae]] family, who considered themselves the natural heirs to the rule of Athens.&lt;ref name = h131&gt;Holland, pp131–132&lt;/ref&gt; In a daring response, Cleisthenes proposed to the Athenian people that he would establish a '[[democracy]]' in Athens, much to the horror of the rest of the aristocracy. Cleisthenes's reasons for suggesting such a radical course of action, which would remove much of his own family's power, are unclear; perhaps he perceived that days of aristocratic rule were coming to an end anyway; certainly he wished to prevent Athens becoming a puppet of Sparta by whatever means necessary.&lt;ref name = h131/&gt; However, as a result of this proposal, Cleisthenes and his family were exiled from Athens, in addition to other dissenting elements, by Isagoras. Having been promised democracy however, the Athenian people seized the moment and revolted, expelling Cleomenes and Isagoras.&lt;ref name = &quot;h133&quot;&gt;Holland, pp133–136&lt;/ref&gt; Cleisthenes was thus restored to Athens (507 BC), and at breakneck speed began to establish democratic government. The establishment of democracy revolutionised Athens, which henceforth became one of the leading cities in Greece.&lt;ref name = &quot;h133&quot;/&gt; The new found freedom and self-governance of the Athenians meant that they were thereafter exceptionally hostile to the return of the tyranny of Hippias, or any form of outside subjugation; by Sparta, Persia or anyone else.&lt;ref name = &quot;h133&quot;/&gt; 

[[File:Darius-Vase.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Darius I of Persia, as imagined by a Greek painter, 4th century BC]]

Cleomenes, unsurprisingly, was not pleased with the events, and marched on Athens with the Spartan army.&lt;ref name = h136&gt;Holland, p136–138&lt;/ref&gt; Cleomenes's attempts to restore Isagoras to Athens ended in a debacle, but fearing the worst, the Athenians had by this point already sent an embassy to Artaphernes in Sardis, to request aid from the Persian Empire.&lt;ref name = h142&gt;Holland, p142&lt;/ref&gt; Artaphernes requested that the Athenians give him a 'earth and water', a traditional token of submission, which the Athenian ambassadors acquiesced to.&lt;ref name = h142/&gt; However, they were severely censured for this when they returned to Athens.&lt;ref name = h142/&gt; At some point later Cleomenes instigated a plot to restore Hippias to the rule of Athens. This failed and Hippias again fled to Sardis and tried to persuade the Persians to subjugate Athens.&lt;ref name = V96&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%23872;layout=;loc=5.95.1 V, 96]&lt;/ref&gt; The Athenians dispatched ambassadors to Artaphernes to dissuade him from taking action, but Artaphernes merely instructed the Athenians to take Hippias back as tyrant.&lt;ref name = &quot;h157&quot;/&gt; Needless to say, the Athenians balked at this, and resolved instead to be openly at war with Persia.&lt;ref name = V96/&gt; Having thus become the enemy of Persia, Athens was already in a position to support the Ionian cities when they began their revolt.&lt;ref name = &quot;h157&quot;/&gt; The fact that the Ionian democracies were inspired by the example of Athens no doubt further persuaded the Athenians to support the Ionian Revolt; especially since the cities of Ionia were (supposedly) originally Athenian colonies.&lt;ref name = &quot;h157&quot;/&gt; 

The Athenians and Eretrians sent a task force of 25 triremes to Asia Minor to aid the revolt.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%23875;layout=;loc=5.98.1 V, 99]&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst there, the Greek army surprised and outmaneuvered Artaphernes, marching to Sardis and there burning the lower city.&lt;ref name = &quot;h160&quot;&gt;Holland, p160&lt;/ref&gt; However, this was as much as the Greeks achieved, and they were then pursued back to the coast by Persian horsemen, losing many men in the process. Despite the fact that their actions were ultimately fruitless, the Eretrians and in particular the Athenians had earned Darius's lasting enmity, and he vowed to punish both cities.&lt;ref name = &quot;h168&quot;&gt;Holland, p168&lt;/ref&gt; The Persian naval victory at the [[Battle of Lade]] (494 BC) all but ended the Ionian Revolt, and by 493 BC, the last hold-outs were vanquished by the Persian fleet.&lt;ref&gt;Holland, p176&lt;/ref&gt; The revolt was used as an opportunity by Darius to extend the empire's border to the islands of the East Aegean&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%23933;layout=;loc=6.32.1 VI, 31]&lt;/ref&gt;  and the [[Propontis]], which had not been part of the Persian dominions before.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%23935;layout=;loc=6.32.1 VI, 33]&lt;/ref&gt; The completion of the pacification of Ionia allowed the Persians to begin planning their next moves; to extinguish the threat to the empire from Greece, and to punish Athens and Eretria.&lt;ref&gt;Holland, p177–178&lt;/ref&gt;

In 492 BC, once the Ionian Revolt had finally been crushed, Darius dispatched an [[First Persian invasion of Greece#492 BC: Mardonius's Campaign|expedition]] to Greece under the command of his son-in-law, [[Mardonius]]. Mardonius re-conquered [[Thrace]] and compelled [[Alexander I of Macedon]] to make [[Macedon]] a client kingdom to Persia, before the wrecking of his fleet brought a premature end to the campaign.&lt;ref name = VI44&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%23946;layout=;loc=6.43.1 VI, 44]&lt;/ref&gt;
However in 490 BC, following up the successes of the previous campaign, Darius decided to send a maritime expedition led by [[Artaphernes]], (son of the satrap to whom Hippias had fled) and [[Datis]], a [[Medes|Median]] admiral. Mardonius had been injured in the prior campaign and had fallen out of favor. The [[First Persian invasion of Greece#490 BC: Datis and Artaphernes' Campaign|expedition]] was intended to bring the [[Cyclades]] into the Persian empire, to punish [[Naxos, Greece|Naxos]] (which had resisted a Persian assault in 499 BC) and then to head to Greece to force Eretria and Athens to submit to Darius or be destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&amp;layout=&amp;loc=6.94.1 VI, 94 ]&lt;/ref&gt; After island-hopping across the Aegean, including successfully attacking Naxos, the Persian task force arrived off Euboea in mid summer. The Persians then proceeded to [[Siege of Eretria|besiege]], capture and burn Eretria. They then headed south down the coast of Attica, en route to complete the final objective of the campaign – to punish Athens.

== Prelude ==
[[Image:BeachedShipsMarathon.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A picture reconstructing the beached Persian ships at Marathon prior to the battle.]]

The Persians sailed down the coast of Attica, and landed at the bay of Marathon, roughly {{convert|25|mi|km}} from Athens, on the advice of the exiled Athenian tyrant Hippias (who had accompanied the expedition).&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&amp;layout=&amp;loc=6.102 VI, 102]&lt;/ref&gt; Under the guidance of [[Miltiades the Younger|Miltiades]], the Athenian general with the greatest experience of fighting the Persians, the Athenian army marched quickly to block the two exits from the plain of Marathon, and prevent the Persians moving inland.&lt;ref name = h187/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cornelius Nepos, Miltiades, IV&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, Athens's greatest runner, [[Pheidippides]] (or Philippides in some accounts) had been sent to Sparta to request that the Spartan army march to the aid of Athens.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231011;layout=;loc=6.106.1 VI, 105]&lt;/ref&gt; Pheidippides arrived during the festival of ''[[Carneia]]'', a sacrosanct period of peace, and was informed that the Spartan army could not march to war until the full moon rose; Athens could not expect reinforcement for at least ten days.&lt;ref name = h187&gt;Holland, pp187–190&lt;/ref&gt; The Athenians would have to hold out at Marathon for the time being, although they were reinforced by the full muster of 1,000 hoplites from the small city of [[Plataea]]; a gesture which did much to steady the nerves of the Athenians,&lt;ref name = h187/&gt; and won unending Athenian gratitude to Plataea.

For approximately five days the armies therefore confronted each other across the plain of Marathon, in stalemate.&lt;ref name = h187/&gt; The flanks of the Athenian camp were protected either by a grove of trees, or an ''abbatis'' of stakes (depending on the exact reading).&lt;ref&gt;Cornelius Nepos, Miltiades, VI&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = L56&gt;Lazenby, p56&lt;/ref&gt; Since every day brought the arrival of the Spartans closer, the delay worked in favor of the Athenians.&lt;ref name = h187/&gt; There were ten Athenian ''strategoi'' (generals) at Marathon, elected by each of the ten ''tribes'' that the Athenians were divided into; Miltiades was one of these.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231009;layout=;loc=6.104.1 VI, 103]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, in overall charge, was the War-Archon (polemarch), [[Callimachus (polemarch)|Callimachus]], who had been elected by the whole citizen body.&lt;ref name = VI109&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231009;layout=;loc=6.104.1 VI, 109]&lt;/ref&gt; Herodotus suggests that command rotated between the ''strategoi'', each taking in turn a day to command the army.&lt;ref name = VI110&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231016;layout=;loc=6.109.1 VI, 110]&lt;/ref&gt; He further suggests that each ''strategos'', on his day in command, instead deferred to Miltiades.&lt;ref name = VI110/&gt; In Herodotus's account, Miltiades is keen to attack the Persians (despite knowing that the Spartans are coming to aid the Athenians), but strangely, chooses to wait until his actual day of command to attack.&lt;ref name = VI110/&gt; This passage is undoubtedly problematic; the Athenians had little to gain by attacking before the Spartans arrived,&lt;ref name = L59/&gt; and there is no real evidence of this rotating generalship.&lt;ref name = L57&gt;Lazenby, p57–59&lt;/ref&gt; There does, however, seem to have been a delay between the Athenian arrival at Marathon, and the battle; Herodotus, who evidently believed that Miltiades was eager to attack, may have made a mistake whilst seeking to explain this delay.&lt;ref name = L57/&gt;

As is discussed [[#Strategic and tactical considerations|below]], the reason for the delay was probably simply that neither the Athenians nor the Persians were willing to risk battle initially.&lt;ref name = L59&gt;Lazenby, pp59–62&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;h191&quot;&gt;Holland, pp191–195&lt;/ref&gt; This then raises the question of why the battle occurred when it did. Herodotus explicitly tells us that the Greeks attacked the Persians (and the other sources confirm this), but it is not clear why they did this before the arrival of the Spartans.&lt;ref name = L59/&gt; There are two main theories to explain this.&lt;ref name = L59/&gt;

The first theory is that the Persian cavalry left Marathon for an unspecified reason, and that the Greeks moved to take advantage of this by attacking. This theory is based on the absence of any mention of cavalry in Herodotus' account of the battle, and an entry in the [[Suda]] dictionary.&lt;ref name = L59/&gt; The entry ''χωρίς ἰππεῖς'' (&quot;without cavalry&quot;) is explained thus: &lt;blockquote&gt; &quot;The cavalry left. When Datis surrendered and was ready for retreat, the Ionians climbed the trees and gave the Athenians the signal that the cavalry had left. And when [[Miltiades the Younger|Miltiades]] realized that, he attacked and thus won. From there comes the above-mentioned quote, which is used when someone breaks ranks before battle&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Suda]], entry ''Without cavalry''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; There are many variations of this theory, but perhaps the most prevalent is that the cavalry was re-embarked on the ships, and was to be sent by sea to attack (undefended) Athens in the rear, whilst the rest of the Persians pinned down the Athenian army at Marathon.&lt;ref name = h187/&gt; This theory therefore utilises Herodotus' suggestion that after Marathon, the Persian army re-embarked and tried to sail around Cape Sounion to attack Athens directly;&lt;ref name = VI115&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;layout=;query=chapter%3D%231021;loc=6.116.1 VI, 115]&lt;/ref&gt; however, according to the first theory this attempt would have occurred ''before'' the battle (and indeed have triggered the battle).&lt;ref name = h191/&gt; 

The second theory is simply that the battle occurred because the Persians finally moved to attack the Athenians.&lt;ref name = L59/&gt; Although this theory has the Persians moving to the ''strategic'' offensive, this can be reconciled with the traditional account of the Athenians attacking the Persians by assuming that, seeing the Persians advancing, the Athenians took the ''tactical'' offensive, and attacked them.&lt;ref name = L59/&gt; Obviously, it cannot be firmly established which theory (if either) is correct. However, both theories imply that there was some kind of Persian activity which occurred on or about the fifth day which ultimately triggered the battle.&lt;ref name = L59/&gt;

=== Date of the battle ===
Herodotus mentions for several events a date in the [[lunisolar calendar]], of which each Greek city-state used a variant.  Astronomical computation allows us to derive an absolute date in the [[proleptic Julian calendar]] which is much used by historians as the chronological frame. [[Philipp August Böckh]] in 1855  concluded that the battle took place on September 12, 490 BC in the Julian calendar, and this is the conventionally accepted date.&lt;ref name = date/&gt;  However, this depends on when exactly the Spartans held their festival and it is possible that the Spartan calendar was one month ahead of that of Athens. In that case the battle took place on August 12, 490 BC.&lt;ref name = date&gt;D.W. Olson ''et al.'', pp34–41&lt;/ref&gt;

== Opposing forces ==
=== Athenians ===
[[Image:Greek Phalanx.jpg|right|thumb|330px|Modern drawing of the [[Phalanx formation]] employed by Greek [[hoplite]]s]]

Herodotus does not give a figure for the size of the Athenian army.  However, [[Cornelius Nepos]],  [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] and [[Plutarch]] all give the figure of 9,000 Athenians and 1,000 Plateans;&lt;ref&gt;Cornelius Nepos, ''Miltiades'', V&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias X, 20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Plutarch, Moralia, 305 B&quot;&gt;Plutarch, ''Moralia'', 305 B&lt;/ref&gt; while Justin suggests that there were 10,000 Athenians and 1,000 Plataeans.&lt;ref&gt;Justin II, 9&lt;/ref&gt; These numbers are highly comparable to the number of troops Herodotus says that the Athenians and Plataeans sent to the [[Battle of Plataea]] 11 years later.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&amp;layout=&amp;loc=9.28 IX, 28]&lt;/ref&gt; Pausanias noticed on the monument to the battle the names of former [[slavery|slaves]] who were freed in exchange for military services.&lt;ref name&gt;Pausanias I, 32&lt;/ref&gt; Modern historians generally accept these numbers as reasonable.&lt;ref name = h187/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lazenby, p54&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Persians ===
:''For a full discussion of the size of the Persian invasion force, see [[First Persian invasion of Greece#Size of the Persian force|First Persian invasion of Greece]]''

According to Herodotus, the fleet sent by Darius consisted of 600 [[trireme]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus  [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231001;layout=;loc=6.96.1 VI, 95]&lt;/ref&gt; Herodotus does not estimate the size of the Persian army, only saying that they were a &quot;large infantry that was well packed&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus  [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&amp;layout=&amp;loc=6.94 VI, 94]&lt;/ref&gt; Among ancient sources, the poet [[Simonides of Ceos|Simonides]], another near-contemporary, says the campaign force numbered 200,000; while a later writer, the Roman [[Cornelius Nepos]] estimates 200,000 infantry and 10,000 cavalry, of which only 100,000 fought in the battle, while the rest were loaded into the fleet that was rounding Cape Sounion;&lt;ref name = Nepos&gt;Cornelius Nepos, ''Miltiades'', IV&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plutarch]] and [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] both independently give 300,000, as does the [[Suda]] dictionary.&lt;ref name=&quot;Plutarch, Moralia, 305 B&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias IV, 22&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Suda, entry ''Hippias''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plato]] and [[Lysias]] give 500,000;&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Menexenus'', 240 A&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lysias, ''Funeral Oration'', 21&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Justin (historian)|Justinus]] 600,000.&lt;ref name = Justin&gt;Justinus II, 9&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern historians have proposed wide ranging numbers for the infantry, from 20,000–100,000 with a consensus of perhaps 25,000;&lt;ref&gt;Davis, pp9–13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holland, p390&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd, p164&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Green&gt;Green, p90&lt;/ref&gt; estimates for the cavalry are in the range of 1,000.&lt;ref&gt;Lazenby, p46&lt;/ref&gt;

== Strategic and tactical considerations ==
[[Image:Archers frieze Darius palace Louvre AOD487.jpg|right|thumb|185px|Persian infantry (probably [[Persian Immortals|Immortals]]), shown in a frieze in Darius's palace, Susa]]

From a strategic point of view, the Athenians had some disadvantages at Marathon. In order to face the Persians in battle, the Athenians had had to summon all available hoplites;&lt;ref name = h187/&gt; and even then they were still probably outnumbered at least 2 to 1.&lt;ref name = L56/&gt; Furthermore, raising such a large army had denuded Athens of defenders, and thus any secondary attack in the Athenian rear would cut the army off from the city; and any direct attack on the city could not be defended against.&lt;ref name = h191/&gt; Still further, defeat at Marathon would mean the complete defeat of Athens, since no other Athenian army existed. The Athenian strategy was therefore to keep the Persian army pinned down at Marathon, blocking both exits from the plain, and thus preventing themselves from being outmanoeuvred.&lt;ref name = h187/&gt; However, these disadvantages were balanced by some advantages. The Athenians initially had no need to seek battle, since they had managed to confine the Persians to the plain of Marathon. Furthermore, time worked in their favour, as every day brought the arrival of the Spartans closer.&lt;ref name = h187/&gt;&lt;ref name = L59/&gt; Having everything to lose by attacking, and much to gain by not attacking, the Athenians remained on the defensive in the run up to the battle.&lt;ref name = L59/&gt; Tactically, hoplites were vulnerable to attacks by cavalry, and since the Persians had substantial numbers of cavalry, this made any offensive manoeuver by the Athenians even more of a risk, and thus reinforced the defensive strategy of the Athenians.&lt;ref name = h191/&gt;

The Persian strategy, on the other hand, was probably principally determined by tactical considerations. The Persian infantry was evidently lightly armoured, and no match for hoplites in a head-on confrontation (as would be demonstrated at the later battles of [[Battle of Thermopylae|Thermopylae]] and [[Battle of Plataea|Plataea]].&lt;ref name = L256&gt;Lazenby, p256&lt;/ref&gt;) Since the Athenians seem to have taken up a strong defensive position at Marathon, the Persian hesitance was probably a reluctance to attack the Athenians head-on.&lt;ref name = h191/&gt;

Whatever event eventually triggered the battle, it obviously altered the strategic or tactical balance sufficiently to induce the Athenians to attack the Persians. If the first theory is correct (see [[#Prelude|above]]), then the absence of cavalry removed the main Athenian tactical disadvantage, and the threat of being outflanked made it imperative to attack.&lt;ref name = h191/&gt; Conversely, if the second theory is correct, then the Athenians were merely reacting to the Persians attacking them.&lt;ref name = L59/&gt; Since the Persian force obviously contained a high proportion of missile troops, a static defensive position would have made little sense for the Athenians;&lt;ref&gt;Lazenby, p67&lt;/ref&gt; the strength of the hoplite was in the melee, and the sooner that could be brought about, the better, from the Athenian point of view.&lt;ref name = L256/&gt; If the second theory is correct, this raises the further question of why the Persians, having hesitated for several days, then attacked. There may have been several strategic reasons for this; perhaps they were aware (or suspected) that the Athenians were expecting reinforcements.&lt;ref name = L59/&gt; Alternatively, since they may have felt the need to force some kind of victory – they could hardly remain at Marathon indefinitely.&lt;ref name = L59/&gt;

== Battle ==
[[File:1stphaseofbattlemarathon.gif|thumb|400px|right|First phase of the battle.]]
[[File:2ndphaseofbattlemarathon.gif|thumb|400px|right|Second phase of the battle.]]

The distance between the two armies at the point of battle had narrowed to &quot;a distance not less than 8 stadia&quot; or about 1,500 meters.&lt;ref name = VI112&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231018;layout=;loc=6.111.1 VI, 112]&lt;/ref&gt; Miltiades ordered the two tribes that were forming the center of the Greek formation, the Leontis tribe led by [[Themistocles]] and the Antiochis tribe led by [[Aristides]], to be arranged in the depth of 4 ranks while the rest of the tribes at their flanks were in ranks of 8.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Aristides'', V&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = VI111&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231018;layout=;loc=6.111.1 VI, 111]&lt;/ref&gt; Some modern commentators have suggested this was a deliberate ploy to encourage a [[double envelopment]] of the Persian centre. However, this supposes a level of training that the Greeks did not possess.&lt;ref&gt;Lazenby, p250&lt;/ref&gt; There is little evidence for any such tactical thinking in Greek battles until [[Battle of Leuctra|Leuctra]] in 371 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Lazenby, p258&lt;/ref&gt; It is therefore probable that this arrangement was made, possibly at the last moment, so that the Athenian line was as long as the Persian line, and would not therefore be outflanked.&lt;ref name = &quot;h191&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lazenby, p64&lt;/ref&gt; 

When the Athenian line was ready, according to one source, the simple signal to advance was given  by Miltiades: &quot;At them&quot;.&lt;ref name = h191/&gt; Herodotus implies the Athenians ran the whole distance to the Persian lines, shouting their ululating war cry, &quot;Ελελευ! Ελελευ!&quot; (&quot;Eleleu! Eleleu!&quot;).&lt;ref name = VI112/&gt; It is doubtful that the Athenians ran the whole distance; in full armour this would be very difficult.&lt;ref name = L66&gt;Lazenby, p66–69&lt;/ref&gt; More likely, they marched until they reached the limit of the archers' effectiveness, the &quot;beaten zone&quot;, (roughly 200 meters), and then broke into a run towards their enemy.&lt;ref name = L66/&gt; Another possibility is that they ran UP TO the 200 meter-mark in broken ranks, and then reformed for the march into battle from there.  Herodotus suggests that this was the first time a Greek army ran into battle in this way; this was probably because it was the first time that a Greek army had faced an enemy composed primarily of missile troops.&lt;ref name = L66/&gt; All this was evidently much to the surprise of the Persians; &quot;...in their minds they charged the Athenians with madness which must be fatal, seeing that they were few and yet were pressing forwards at a run, having neither cavalry nor archers&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&amp;layout=&amp;loc=6.110 VI, 110]&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, based on their previous experience of the Greeks, the Persians might be excused for this; Herodotus tells us that the Athenians at Marathon were &quot;first to endure looking at Median dress and men wearing it, for up until then just hearing the name of the Medes caused the Hellenes to panic&quot;.&lt;ref name = VI112/&gt; Passing through the hail of arrows launched by the Persian army, protected for the most part by their armour, the Greek line finally collided with the enemy army. Holland provides an evocative description: &lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;The enemy directly in their path...realised to their horror that [the Athenians], far from providing the easy pickings for their bowmen, as they had first imagined, were not going to be halted...The impact was devastating. The Athenians had honed their style of fighting in combat with other phalanxes, wooden shields smashing against wooden shields, iron spear tips clattering against breastplates of bronze...in those first terrible seconds of collision, there was nothing but a pulverizing crash of metal into flesh and bone; then the rolling of the Athenian tide over men wearing, at most, quilted jerkins for protection, and armed, perhaps, with nothing more than bows or slings. The hoplites' ash spears, rather than shivering...could instead stab and stab again, and those of the enemy who avoided their fearful jabbing might easily be crushed to death beneath the sheer weight of the advancing men of bronze.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;h194&quot;&gt;Holland, pp194–197&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Athenian wings quickly routed the inferior Persian levies on the flanks, before turning inwards to surround the Persian centre, which had been more successful against the thin Greek centre.&lt;ref name= VI113/&gt; The battle ended when the Persian centre then broke in panic towards their ships, pursued by the Greeks.&lt;ref name= VI113&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&amp;layout=&amp;loc=6.113.1 VI, 113]&lt;/ref&gt; Some, unaware of the local terrain, ran towards the swamps where unknown numbers drowned.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pausanias I, 32&quot;&gt;Pausanias I, 32&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lazenby, p71&lt;/ref&gt; The Athenians pursued the Persians back to their ships, and managed to capture seven ships, though the majority were able to successfully launch.&lt;ref name = VI115&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&amp;layout=&amp;loc=6.115.1 VI, 115]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = VI114&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&amp;layout=&amp;loc=6.114.1 VI, 114]&lt;/ref&gt; Herodotus recounts the story that [[Cynaegirus]], brother of the playwright [[Aeschylus]], who was also among the fighters, charged into the sea, grabbed one Persian trireme, and started pulling it towards shore. A member of the crew saw him, cut off his hand, and Cynegirus died.&lt;ref name = VI114/&gt;

Herodotus records that 6,400 Persian bodies were counted on the battlefield, and it is unknown how many more perished in the swamps.&lt;ref name = VI117&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231023;layout=;loc=6.116.1 VI, 117]&lt;/ref&gt; The Athenians lost 192 men and the Plataeans 11.&lt;ref name = VI117/&gt; Among the dead were the war [[archon]] Callimachus and the general Stesilaos.&lt;ref name = VI114/&gt;

== Aftermath ==
{{Main|Greco-Persian Wars|Second Persian invasion of Greece}}

In the immediate aftermath of the battle, Herodotus says that the Persian fleet sailed around Cape Sounion to attack Athens directly.&lt;ref name = VI115/&gt; As has been discussed [[#Prelude|above]], some modern historians place this attempt just before the battle. Either way, the Athenians evidently realised that their city was still under threat, and marched as quickly as possible back to Athens.&lt;ref name = VI116&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231022;layout=;loc=6.115.1 VI, 116]&lt;/ref&gt;
The two tribes which had been in the centre of the Athenian line, stayed to guard the battlefield, under the command of Aristides.&lt;ref&gt;Holland, p218&lt;/ref&gt; The Athenians arrived in time to prevent the Persians from securing a landing, and seeing that the opportunity was lost, the Persians turned about and returned to Asia.&lt;ref name = VI116/&gt; Connected with this episode, Herodotus recounts a rumour that this manoeuver by the Persians had been planned in conjunction with the [[Alcmaeonid]]s, the prominent Athenian aristocratic family, and that a &quot;shield-signal&quot; had been given after the battle.&lt;ref name = VI115/&gt; Although many interpretations of this have been offered, it is impossible to tell whether this was true, and if so, what exactly the signal meant.&lt;ref&gt;Lazenby, pp72–73&lt;/ref&gt; On the next day, the Spartan army arrived at Marathon, having covered the 220 kilometers (140 miles) in only three days. The Spartans toured the battlefield at Marathon, and agreed that the Athenians had won a great victory.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&amp;layout=&amp;loc=6.120 VI, 120]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Hill where the Athenians were buried after the Battle of Marathon.JPG.jpg|thumb|220px|left|Hill where the Athenian dead were buried after the Battle of Marathon]]

The dead of Marathon were awarded by the Athenians the special honor of being the only ones who were buried where they died instead of the main Athenian cemetery at Keramikos.&lt;ref&gt;Thucydides II, 34&lt;/ref&gt; On the tomb of the Athenians this [[epigram]] composed by Simonides was written:

:Ελλήνων προμαχούντες Αθηναίοι Μαραθώνι
:χρυσοφόρων Μήδων εστόρεσαν δύναμιν

:Fighting in the forefront of the Hellenes, the Athenians at Marathon
:destroyed the might of the gold-bearing Medes.

In the meanwhile, Darius began raising a huge new army with which he meant to completely subjugate Greece; however, in 486 BC, his [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] subjects revolted, indefinitely postponing any Greek expedition.&lt;ref name = h203&gt;Holland, p203&lt;/ref&gt; Darius then died whilst preparing to march on Egypt, and the throne of Persia passed to his son Xerxes I.&lt;ref&gt;Holland, pp206–207&lt;/ref&gt; Xerxes crushed the Egyptian revolt, and very quickly re-started the preparations for the invasion of Greece.&lt;ref name = h208&gt;Holland, pp208–211&lt;/ref&gt; The epic [[second Persian invasion of Greece]] finally began in 480 BC, and the Persians met with initial success at the battles of [[Battle of Thermopylae|Thermopylae]] and [[Battle of Artemisium|Artemisium]].&lt;ref&gt;Lazenby, p151&lt;/ref&gt; However, defeat at the [[Battle of Salamis]] would be the turning point in the campaign,&lt;ref&gt;Lazenby, p197&lt;/ref&gt; and the next year the expedition was ended by the decisive Greek victory at the [[Battle of Plataea]].&lt;ref&gt;Holland, pp350–355&lt;/ref&gt;

== Significance ==
[[Image:ROM-CorinthianHelmetAndSkull-BattleOfMarathon.png|thumb|right|180px|Greek Corinthian Helmet and the skull reportedly found inside it from the Battle of Marathon, now residing in the [[Royal Ontario Museum]], Toronto.]]

The defeat at Marathon barely touched the vast resources of the Persian empire, yet for the Greeks it was an enormously significant victory. It was the first time the Greeks had beaten the Persians, and showed them that the Persians were not invincible, and that resistance, rather than subjugation, was possible.&lt;ref&gt;Holland, p201&lt;/ref&gt; 

The battle was a defining moment for the young Athenian democracy, showing what might be achieved through unity and self-belief; indeed, the battle effectively marks the start of a 'golden age' for Athens.&lt;ref name = h138&gt;Holland, p138&lt;/ref&gt; This was also applicable to Greece as a whole; &quot;their victory endowed the Greeks with a faith in their destiny that was to endure for three centuries, during which western culture was born&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;hxvi&quot;&gt;Holland, pp xvi–xvii&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;jfc&quot;&gt;Fuller, pp11–32&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Stuart Mill]]'s famous opinion was that &quot;the Battle of Marathon, even as an event in British history, is more important than the [[Battle of Hastings]]&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;BDLI&quot;&gt;Powell ''et al.'', 2001&lt;/ref&gt; It seems that the Athenian playwright [[Aeschylus]] considered his participation at Marathon to be his greatest achievement in life (rather than his plays) since on his gravestone there was the following epigram:

:{{polytonic|Αἰσχύλον Εὐφορίωνος Ἀθηναῖον τόδε κεύθει}}
:{{polytonic|μνῆμα καταφθίμενον πυροφόροιο Γέλας·}}
:{{polytonic|ἀλκὴν δ’ εὐδόκιμον Μαραθώνιον ἄλσος ἂν εἴποι}}
:{{polytonic|καὶ βαθυχαιτήεις Μῆδος ἐπιστάμενος}}

:This tomb the dust of Aeschylus doth hide,
:Euphorion's son and fruitful Gela's pride.
:How tried his valor, Marathon may tell,
:And long-haired Medes, who knew it all too well.&lt;ref&gt;''Anthologiae Graecae Appendix'', vol. 3, ''Epigramma sepulcrale'' p17&lt;/ref&gt;

Militarily, a major lesson for the Greeks was the potential of the hoplite phalanx. This style had developed during internecine warfare amongst the Greeks; since each city-state fought in the same way, the advantages and disadvantages of the hoplite phalanx had not been obvious.&lt;ref name = &quot;h194&quot;/&gt; Marathon was the first time a phalanx faced more lightly armed troops, and revealed how effective the hoplites could be in battle.&lt;ref name = &quot;h194&quot;/&gt; The phalanx formation was still vulnerable to cavalry (the cause of much caution by the Greek forces at the [[Battle of Plataea]]), but used in the right circumstances, it was now shown to be a potentially devastating weapon.&lt;ref name = &quot;h344&quot;&gt;Holland, pp344–352&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 8, 2010, the United States House of Representatives honoured the battle of Marathon as one of the most significant battles in human history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-111hres1704eh/pdf/BILLS-111hres1704eh.pdf H. Res. 1704], In the House of Representatives, U. S., December 8, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==
=== Legends associated with the battle ===
The most famous legend associated with Marathon is that of the runner Pheidippides/Philippides bringing news to Athens of the battle, which is described [[#Marathon run|below]].

[[Image:Pan satyre della Valle.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Statue of Pan, Capitoline Museum, Rome]]

Pheidippides' run to Sparta to bring aid has other legends associated with it. Herodotus mentions that Pheidippides was visited by the god [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]] on his way to Sparta (or perhaps on his return journey).&lt;ref name = &quot;h187&quot;/&gt; Pan asked why the Athenians did not honor him and the awed Pheidippides promised that they would do so from then on. The god apparently felt that the promise would be kept, so he appeared in battle and at the crucial moment he instilled the Persians with his own brand of fear, the mindless, frenzied fear that bore his name: &quot;[[panic]]&quot;. After the battle, a sacred precinct was established for Pan in a grotto on the north slope of the Acropolis, and a sacrifice was annually offered.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&amp;layout=&amp;loc=6.105 VI, 105]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Similarly, after the victory the festival of the ''Agroteras Thysia'' (&quot;sacrifice to the Agrotéra&quot;) was held at [[Agrae]] near [[Athens]], in honor of [[Artemis]] [[Agrotera]] (&quot;Artemis the Huntress&quot;). This was in fulfillment of a vow made by the city before the battle, to offer in sacrifice a number of goats equal to that of the [[Persia]]ns slain in the conflict. The number was so great, it was decided to offer 500 goats yearly until the number was filled. [[Xenophon]] notes that at his time, 90 years after the battle, goats were still offered yearly.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''On the Malice of Herodotus'', 26&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Xenophon, ''Anabasis'' III, 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aelian, ''Varia Historia'' II, 25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aristophanes, ''The Knights'', 660&lt;/ref&gt;

Plutarch mentions that the Athenians saw the phantom of King [[Theseus]], the mythical hero of Athens, leading the army in full battle gear in the charge against the Persians,&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Theseus'', 35&lt;/ref&gt; and indeed he was depicted in the mural of the [[Stoa Poikile]] fighting for the Athenians, along with the twelve Olympian gods and other heroes.&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias I, 15&lt;/ref&gt; Pausanias also tells us that:&lt;blockquote&gt;''&quot;They say too that there chanced to be present in the battle a man of rustic appearance and dress. Having slaughtered many of the foreigners with a plough he was seen no more after the engagement. When the Athenians made enquiries at the oracle, the god merely ordered them to honor Echetlaeus (&quot;he of the Plough-tail&quot;) as a hero.&quot;''&lt;ref name=&quot;Pausanias I, 32&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Another tale from the conflict is of the dog of Marathon. [[Claudius Aelianus|Aelian]] relates that one hoplite brought his dog to the Athenian encampment. The dog followed his master to battle and attacked the Persians at his master's side. He also informs us that this dog is depicted in the mural of the Stoa Poikile.&lt;ref&gt;Aelian, ''On the Nature of Animals'' VII, 38&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Marathon run ===
{{Main|Marathon}}

According to Herodotus, an Athenian runner named [[Pheidippides]] was sent to run from [[Athens]] to [[Sparta]] to ask for assistance before the battle. He ran a distance of over 140 miles, arriving in Sparta the day after he left.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&amp;layout=&amp;loc=6.105 VI, 105–106]&lt;/ref&gt; Then, following the battle, the Athenian army marched the 25 or so miles back to Athens at a very high pace (considering the quantity of armour, and the fatigue after the battle), in order to head off the Persian force sailing around Cape Sounion. They arrived back in the late afternoon, in time to see the Persian ships turn away from Athens, thus completing the Athenian victory.&lt;ref name = &quot;h198&quot;&gt;Holland, p198&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, in popular imagination, these two events became confused with each other, leading to a legendary but inaccurate version of events. This myth has Pheidippides running from Marathon to Athens after the battle, to announce the Greek victory with the word &quot;Nenikēkamen!&quot; ([[Ancient Greek|Attic]]: {{polytonic|Νενικήκαμεν}} (We were victorious!)), whereupon he promptly died of exhaustion. Most accounts incorrectly attribute this story to Herodotus; actually, the story first appears in [[Plutarch]]'s ''On the Glory of Athens'' in the 1st century AD, who quotes from [[Heraclides Ponticus|Heracleides of Pontus]]'s lost work, giving the runner's name as either Thersipus of Erchius or Eucles.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Moralia'', 347C&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lucian of Samosata]] (2nd century AD) gives the same story but names the runner Philippides (not Pheidippides).&lt;ref&gt;Lucian, III&lt;/ref&gt; It should be noted that in some medieval codices of Herodotus the name of the runner between Athens and Sparta before the battle is given as Philippides and in a few modern editions this name is preferred.&lt;ref&gt;Lazenby, p52&lt;/ref&gt;

When the idea of a modern [[Olympic Games|Olympics]] became a reality at the end of the 19th century, the initiators and organizers were looking for a great popularizing event, recalling the ancient glory of Greece.&lt;ref name = AIMS/&gt; The idea of organizing a 'marathon race' came from [[Michel Bréal]], who wanted the event to feature in the [[1896 Summer Olympics|first modern Olympic Games]] in 1896 in Athens. This idea was heavily supported by [[Pierre de Coubertin]], the founder of the modern Olympics, as well as the Greeks.&lt;ref name = &quot;AIMS&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aimsworldrunning.org/marathon_history.htm|title=Marathon History|accessdate=2008-10-15|author=AIMS}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would echo the legendary version of events, with the competitors running from Marathon to Athens. So popular was this event that it quickly caught on, becoming a fixture at the Olympic games, with major cities staging their own annual events.&lt;ref name = AIMS/&gt; The distance eventually became fixed at 26 miles 385 yards, or 42.195&amp;nbsp;km, though for the first years it was variable, being around {{convert|25|mi|km}} — the approximate distance from Marathon to Athens.&lt;ref name = &quot;AIMS&quot;/&gt;

The '''balance of trade''' (or ''net exports'', sometimes symbolized as ''NX'') is the difference between the monetary value of [[export]]s and [[International trade|import]]s of output in an economy over a certain period. It is the relationship between a nation's imports and exports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sullivan|first=Arthur|authorlink=Arthur O'Sullivan|coauthors=Steven M. Sheffrin|title=Economics: Principles in action|publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall|year=2003|location= Upper Saddle River, New Jersey 07458|pages=462|url=http://www.pearsonschool.com/index.cfm?locator=PSZ3R9&amp;PMDbSiteId=2781&amp;PMDbSolutionId=6724&amp;PMDbCategoryId=&amp;PMDbProgramId=12881&amp;level=4|doi=|isbn=0-13-063085-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; A positive balance is known as a '''trade surplus''' if it consists of exporting more than is imported; a negative balance is referred to as a '''trade deficit''' or, informally, a trade gap. The balance of trade is sometimes divided into a goods and a services balance.

Early understanding of the functioning of balance of trade informed the economic policies of Early Modern Europe that are grouped under the heading [[mercantilism]]. An early statement appeared in ''Discourse of the Common Weal of this Realm of England'', 1549: &quot;We must always take heed that we buy no more from strangers than we sell them, for so should we impoverish ourselves and enrich them.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Now attributed to [[Thomas Smith (diplomat)|Sir Thomas Smith]]; quoted in [[Fernand Braudel]], ''The Wheels of Commerce'', vol. II of ''Civilization and Capitalism 15th-18th Century'', 1979:204.&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly a systematic and coherent explanation of balance of trade was made public through [[Thomas Mun]]'s c1630 &quot;England's treasure by forraign trade, or, The balance of our forraign trade is the rule of our treasure&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Mun, Oxford National Dictionary of Biography&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
[[Image:Panama Canal Ship Entering Chamber.jpeg|right|thumb|350px|The balance of trade encompasses the activity of exports and imports, like the work of this cargo ship going through the [[Panama Canal]].]]

The balance of trade forms part of the [[current account]], which includes other transactions such as income from the [[international investment position]] as well as international aid. If the current account is in surplus, the country's net international asset position increases correspondingly. Equally, a deficit decreases the net international asset position.

The trade balance is identical to the difference between a country's output and its domestic demand (the difference between what goods a country produces and how many goods it buys from abroad; this does not include money re-spent on foreign stock, nor does it factor in the concept of importing goods to produce for the domestic market).

Measuring the balance of trade can be problematic because of problems with recording and collecting data. As an illustration of this problem, when official data for all the world's countries are added up, exports exceed imports by almost 1%; it appears the world is running a positive balance of trade with itself. This cannot be true, because all transactions involve an equal [[credit (finance)|credit]] or [[debit]] in the account of each nation. The discrepancy is widely believed to be explained by transactions intended to launder money or evade taxes, smuggling and other visibility problems. However, especially for developed countries, accuracy is likely.

Factors that can affect the balance of trade include:
*The cost of production (land, labor, capital, taxes, incentives, etc.) in the exporting economy ''vis-à-vis'' those in the importing economy;
*The cost and availability of raw materials, intermediate goods and other inputs;
*Exchange rate movements;
*Multilateral, bilateral and unilateral taxes or restrictions on trade;
*Non-tariff barriers such as environmental, health or safety standards;
*The availability of adequate foreign exchange with which to pay for imports; and
*Prices of goods manufactured at home (influenced by the responsiveness of supply)

In addition, the trade balance is likely to differ across the [[business cycle]]. In export-led growth (such as oil and early industrial goods), the balance of trade will improve during an economic expansion. However, with domestic demand led growth (as in the United States and Australia) the trade balance will worsen at the same stage in the business cycle.

Since the mid 1980s, the United States has had a growing deficit in tradeable goods, especially with Asian nations (China and Japan) which now hold large sums of U.S debt that has funded the consumption.&lt;ref name=Bivens/&gt;&lt;ref name=debt&gt;[http://www.treas.gov/tic/mfh.txt MAJOR FOREIGN HOLDERS OF TREASURY SECURITIES]. ''U.S. Treasury.gov''&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. has a trade surplus with nations such as [[Australia]]. The issue of trade deficits can be complex. Trade deficits generated in tradeable goods such as manufactured goods or software may impact domestic employment to different degrees than trade deficits in raw materials.

Economies such as [[Canada]], [[Japan]], and [[Germany]] which have savings surpluses, typically run trade surpluses. [[China]], a high growth economy, has tended to run trade surpluses. A higher savings rate generally corresponds to a trade surplus. Correspondingly, the U.S. with its lower savings rate has tended to run high trade deficits, especially with Asian nations.

===Conditions where trade imbalances may be problematic===
Those who ignore the effects of long run trade deficits may be confusing [[David Ricardo]]'s principle of [[comparative advantage]] with [[Adam Smith]]'s principle of [[absolute advantage]], specifically ignoring the latter. The economist [[Paul Craig Roberts]] notes that the [[comparative advantage]] principles developed by [[David Ricardo]] do not hold where the factors of production are internationally mobile.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, Paul Craig (August 7, 2003).

Since the [[stagflation]] of the 1970s, the U.S. economy has been characterized by slower GDP growth. In 1985, the U.S. began its growing trade deficit with China. Over the long run, nations with trade surpluses tend also to have a savings surplus. The U.S. generally has lower savings rates than its trading partners, which tend to have trade surpluses. Germany, France, Japan, and Canada have maintained higher savings rates than the U.S. over the long run.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/PrinterFriendly.cfm?Story_ID=3839554 The shift away form thrift].''The Economist'', April 7, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conditions where trade imbalances may not be problematic===
Small trade deficits are generally not considered to be harmful to either the importing or exporting economy. However, when a national trade imbalance expands beyond prudence (generally thought to be several{{clarify|date=November 2010}} percent of GDP, for several years), adjustments tend to occur. While unsustainable imbalances &lt;ref&gt;Aristovnik, Aleksander, 2006. &quot;Current Account Sustainability In Selected Transition Countries&quot; William Davidson Institute Working Papers Series WP844.&lt;/ref&gt; may persist for long periods (cf, [[Singapore]] and [[New Zealand]]’s surpluses and deficits, respectively), the distortions likely to be caused by large flows of wealth out of one economy and into another tend to become intolerable.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} 

In simple terms, trade deficits are paid for out of [[foreign exchange reserves]], and may continue until such reserves are depleted. At such a point, the importer can no longer continue to purchase more than is sold abroad. This is likely to have [[exchange rate]] implications: a sharp loss of value in the deficit economy’s exchange rate with the surplus economy’s currency will change the relative price of [[tradable goods]], and facilitate a return to balance or (more likely) an over-shooting into surplus the other direction.

More complexly, an economy may be unable to export enough goods to pay for its imports, but is able to find funds elsewhere. [[Service exports]], for example, are more than sufficient to pay for [[Hong Kong]]’s domestic goods export shortfall. In poorer countries, [[foreign aid]] may fill the gap while in rapidly developing economies a [[capital account]] surplus often off-sets a [[current-account]] deficit. Finally, there are some economies where transfers from nationals working abroad contribute significantly to paying for imports. [[The Philippines]], [[Bangladesh]] and [[Mexico]] are examples of transfer-rich economies.

===Adam Smith on trade deficits===
&quot;In the foregoing part of this chapter I have endeavoured to show, even upon the principles of the commercial system, how unnecessary it is to lay extraordinary restraints upon the importation of goods from those countries with which the balance of trade is supposed to be disadvantageous.
Nothing, however, can be more absurd than this whole doctrine of the balance of trade, upon which, not only these restraints, but almost all the other regulations of commerce are founded. When two places trade with one another, this [absurd] doctrine supposes that, if the balance be even, neither of them either loses or gains; but if it leans in any degree to one side, that one of them loses and the other gains in proportion to its declension from the exact equilibrium.&quot; (Smith, 1776, book IV, ch. iii, part ii)
&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Adam. (1776). An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations, Indianapolis: Liberty Fund, 1981, 2 vols., (1776) (reprint of the Clarendon Press edition, Oxford 1976, with Edward Cannan's original index from 1922)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Frédéric Bastiat on the fallacy of trade deficits===
The 19th century economist and philosopher [[Frédéric Bastiat]] expressed the idea that trade deficits actually were a manifestation of profit, rather than a loss. He proposed as an example to suppose that he, a Frenchman, exported French wine and imported British coal, turning a profit. He supposed he was in France, and sent a cask of wine which was worth 50 francs to England. The customhouse would record an export of 50 francs. If, in England, the wine sold for 70 francs (or the pound equivalent), which he then used to buy coal, which he imported into France, and was found to be worth 90 francs in France, he would have made a profit of 40 francs. But the customhouse would say that the value of imports exceeded that of exports and was trade deficit against the ledger of France.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bastiat: Selected Essays&quot;&gt;[http://www.econlib.org/library/Bastiat/basEss13.html Bastiat: Selected Essays]&lt;/ref&gt;

Note that Bastiat only comes to this conclusion thanks to the customhouse's accounting error. The customhouse is valuing imports and exports based on the good's value in their home country, not the price paid when the actual international trade occurs as is conventionally done when calculating the trade balance. Correcting for the accounting error a neutral conclusion is reached: France sells wine for 70 and buys coal for 70, and Bastiat's profit does not come from England but simply from trading goods within France.

By ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]'', Bastiat argued that the national trade deficit was an indicator of a successful economy, rather than a failing one. Bastiat predicted that a successful, growing economy would result in greater trade deficits, and an unsuccessful, shrinking economy would result in lower trade deficits. This was later, in the 20th century, affirmed by economist [[Milton Friedman]].

===John Maynard Keynes on the balance of trade===
In the last few years of his life, [[John Maynard Keynes]] was much preoccupied with the question of balance in international trade. He was the leader of the British delegation to the [[United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference]] in 1944 that established the [[Bretton Woods system]] of international currency management.

He was the principal author of a proposal — the so-called Keynes Plan —— for an [[International Clearing Union]]. The two governing principles of the plan were that the problem of settling outstanding balances should be solved by 'creating' additional 'international money', and that debtor and creditor should be treated almost alike as disturbers of equilibrium. In the event, though, the plans were rejected, in part because &quot;American opinion was naturally reluctant to accept the principal of equality of treatment so novel in debtor-creditor relationships&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book|author=Crowther, Geoffrey|title=An Outline of Money|version=Second Edition|publisher= Thomas Nelson and Sons|year=1948|pages=326–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His view, supported by many economists and commentators at the time, was that creditor nations may be just as responsible as debtor nations for disequilibrium in exchanges and that both should be under an obligation to bring trade back into a state of balance. Failure for them to do so could have serious consequences. In the words of [[Geoffrey Crowther, Baron Crowther|Geoffrey Crowther]], then editor of [[The Economist]], &quot;If the economic relationships between nations are not, by one means or another, brought fairly close to balance, then there is no set of financial arrangements that can rescue the world from the impoverishing results of chaos.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Crowther, Geoffrey|title=An Outline of Money|version=Second Edition|publisher=Thomas Nelson and Sons
|year=1948|page=336}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These ideas were informed by events prior to the [[Great Depression]] when — in the opinion of Keynes and others — international lending, primarily by the U.S., exceeded the capacity of sound investment and so got diverted into non-productive and speculative uses, which in turn invited default and a sudden stop to the process of lending.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Crowther, Geoffrey| title=An Outline of Money|version=Second Edition|publisher=Thomas Nelson and Sons|year=1948|pages= 368–72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Influenced by Keynes, economics texts in the immediate post-war period put a significant emphasis on balance in trade. For example, the second edition of the popular introductory textbook, ''An Outline of Money'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Crowther, Geoffrey|title=An Outline of Money|version= Second Edition|publisher=Thomas Nelson and Sons|year=1948}}&lt;/ref&gt; devoted the last three of its ten chapters to questions of foreign exchange management and in particular the 'problem of balance'. However, in more recent years, since the end of the [[Bretton Woods system]] in 1971, with the increasing influence of [[Monetarist]] schools of thought in the 1980s, and particularly in the face of large sustained trade imbalances, these concerns — and particularly concerns about the destabilising effects of large trade surpluses — have largely disappeared from [[mainstream economics]] discourse&lt;ref&gt;See for example, Krugman, P and Wells, R (2006). &quot;Economics&quot;, Worth Publishers&lt;/ref&gt; and Keynes' insights have slipped from view.&lt;ref&gt;although see Duncan, R (2005). &quot;The Dollar Crisis: Causes, Consequences, Cures&quot;, Wiley&lt;/ref&gt; They are receiving some attention again in the wake of the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2010]].&lt;ref&gt;See for example,{{cite web|url= http://www.monbiot.com/archives/2008/11/18/clearing-up-this-mess/|title=Clearing Up This Mess| date=2008-11-18|accessdate=2009-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Milton Friedman on trade deficits===
In the 1980s, [[Milton Friedman]], the [[Nobel Prize]]-winning economist and father of [[Monetarism]], contended that some of the concerns of trade deficits are unfair criticisms in an attempt to push macroeconomic policies favorable to exporting industries.

Prof. Friedman argued that trade deficits are not necessarily important as high exports raise the value of the currency, reducing aforementioned exports, and vice versa for imports, thus naturally removing trade deficits '''not due to investment'''. Since 1971, when the Nixon administration decided to abolish fixed exchange rates, America's Current Account accumulated trade deficits have totaled $7.75 Trillion as of 2010. This deficit exists as it is matched by investment coming in to the United States- purely by the definition of the balance of payments, any current account deficit that exists is matched by an inflow of foreign investment. 

Milton Friedman's son, [[David D. Friedman]], shares his father's view and cites the comparative advantage concepts of [[David Ricardo]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.daviddfriedman.com/Academic/Price_Theory/PThy_Chapter_6/PThy_Chapter_6.html Price Theory, Chapter 6: Simple Trade]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the U.S. had experienced high inflation and Friedman's policy positions tended to defend the stronger dollar at that time. He stated his belief that these trade deficits were not necessarily harmful to the economy at the time since the currency comes back to the country (country A sells to country B, country B sells to country C who buys from country A, but the trade deficit only includes A and B). However, it may be in one form or another including the possible tradeoff of foreign control of assets. In his view, the &quot;worst case scenario&quot; of the currency never returning to the country of origin was actually the best possible outcome: the country actually purchased its goods by exchanging them for pieces of cheaply-made paper. As Friedman put it, this would be the same result as if the exporting country burned the dollars it earned, never returning it to market circulation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ideachannel.tv/ ''Free to Choose'' video series from PBS]&lt;/ref&gt; This position is a more refined version of the theorem first discovered by [[David Hume]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.econlib.org/library/LFBooks/Hume/hmMPL28.html|author=Hume, David|title=Essays, Moral, Political, and Literary|version=Eugene F. Miller, ed.|publisher=Liberty Fund, Inc|year=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hume argued that England could not permanently gain from exports, because hoarding gold (i.e., currency) would make gold more plentiful in England; therefore, the prices of English goods would rise, making them less attractive exports and making foreign goods more attractive imports. In this way, countries' trade balances would balance out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/bios/Hume.html| title=David Hume: The Concise Encyclopedia of Economics|year=2008|accessdate=2009-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Friedman believed that deficits would be corrected by free markets as floating currency rates rise or fall with time to encourage or discourage imports in favor of the exports, reversing again in favor of imports as the currency gains strength. In the real world, a potential difficulty is that currency markets are far from a free market, with government and central banks being major players, and this is unlikely to change within the foreseeable future. Nevertheless, recent developments have shown that the global economy is undergoing a fundamental shift. For many years, the U.S. has borrowed and bought while in general, the rest of the world has lent and sold. However, as Friedman predicted, this paradigm appears to be changing.

As of October 2007, the U.S. dollar weakened against the euro, British pound, and many other currencies. For instance, the euro hit $1.42 in October 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/19/business/worldbusiness/19euro.html?ref=worldbusiness|work=The New York Times|title=Dollar Hits a New Low, Oil Hits a New High|first=Carter|last=Dougherty|date= October 19, 2007|accessdate=April 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; the strongest it has been since its birth in 1999. Against this backdrop, American exporters are finding quite favorable overseas markets for their products and U.S. consumers are responding to their general housing slowdown by slowing their spending. Furthermore, China, the Middle East, central Europe and Africa are absorbing more of the world's imports which in the end may result in a world economy that is more evenly balanced. All of this could well add up to a major readjustment of the U.S. trade deficit, which as a percentage of GDP, began in 1991.&lt;ref name=&quot;wsj-2007&quot;&gt;Michael M. Phillips, [http://online.wsj.com/article/SB119024783913033237.html?mod=todays_us_page_one World Economy in Flux As America Downshifts]&lt;/ref&gt;

Friedman contended that the structure of the balance of payments was misleading. In an interview with Charlie Rose, he stated that &quot;on the books&quot; the US is a net borrower of funds, using those funds to pay for goods and services. He essentially claimed that the foreign assets were not carried on the books at their higher, truer value.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

Friedman presented his analysis of the balance of trade in ''[[Free to Choose]]'', widely considered his most significant popular work.

===Warren Buffett on trade deficits===
The successful American businessman and investor [[Warren Buffett]] was quoted in the Associated Press (January 20, 2006) as saying &quot;The U.S trade deficit is a bigger threat to the domestic economy than either the federal budget deficit or consumer debt and could lead to political turmoil... Right now, the rest of the world owns $3 trillion more of us than we own of them.&quot; Buffett has proposed a tool called [[Import Certificates]] as a solution to the United States' problem and ensure [[balanced trade]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/growing.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physical balance of trade==
Monetary balance of trade is different from physical balance of trade&lt;ref&gt;[http://stats.oecd.org/glossary/detail.asp?ID=6542 Physical Trade Balance, OECD Glossary of Statistical Terms]&lt;/ref&gt; (which is expressed in amount of raw materials, known also as Total Material Consumption). Developed countries usually import a lot of primary raw materials from developing countries at low prices. Often, these materials are then converted into finished products, and a significant amount of value is added. Although for instance the EU (as well as many other developed countries) has a balanced monetary balance of trade, its physical trade balance (especially with developing countries) is negative, meaning that a lot less material is exported than imported. For this reason, activists talk about the issue of [[ecological debt]] which implies a sort of predatory economic system. The nature of the trade balance statistics is such that it conceals distorted material flow.

==United States Trade Deficit==

[[File:US Trade Balance 1980 2010.svg|thumb|500px|United States balance of trade (1980–2010), with negative numbers denoting a trade deficit]]

The U.S. has held a trade deficit starting late in the 1960s. Its trade deficit has been increasing at a large rate since 1997 &lt;ref&gt;http://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/statistics/historical/gands.txt&lt;/ref&gt; (See chart) and increased by 49.8 billion dollars between 2005 and 2006, setting a record high of 817.3 billion dollars, up from 767.5 billion dollars the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/balance/c0004.html#2008 FTD - Statistics - Country Data - U.S. Trade Balance with World (Seasonally Adjusted)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The graph indicates that, as [[Frédéric Bastiat]] predicted, the deficit slackened during recessions and grew during periods of expansion. Also of note, many economists calculate trade deficits and/or current account deficits as a percentage of GDP. The US last had a trade surplus in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;http://usinfo.org/enus/economy/trade/docs/06s1288.xls&lt;/ref&gt; Every year there has been a major reduction in economic growth, it is followed by a reduction in the US trade deficit.&lt;ref name=&quot;wsj-2007&quot;/&gt;

Our '''biosphere''' is the global sum of all [[ecosystem]]s. It can also be called the zone of [[life]] on [[Earth]], a closed (apart from solar and cosmic radiation) and self-regulating system.&lt;ref name = &quot;ColumbiaEncyc&quot;&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia

==Origin and use of the term==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Oceanography]] --&gt;
The term &quot;biosphere&quot; was coined by geologist [[Eduard Suess]] in 1875, which he defined as:&lt;ref&gt;Seuss, E. (1875) ''Die Entstehung Der Alpen'' [''The Origin of the Alps'']. Vienna: W. Braunmuller.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|&quot;The place on Earth's surface where life dwells.&quot;}}&lt;/div&gt;

While this concept has a geological origin, it is an indication of the impact of both [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] and [[Matthew F. Maury|Maury]] on the [[earth sciences]]. The biosphere's ecological context comes from the 1920s (''see'' [[Vladimir I. Vernadsky]]), preceding the 1935 introduction of the term &quot;[[ecosystem]]&quot; by Sir [[Arthur Tansley]] (see [[Ecology (history)|ecology history]]). Vernadsky defined [[ecology]] as the science of the biosphere. It is an [[interdisciplinary]] concept for integrating [[astronomy]], [[geophysics]], [[meteorology]], [[biogeography]], [[evolution]], [[geology]], [[geochemistry]], [[hydrology]] and, generally speaking, all life and earth sciences.

===Narrow definition===
[[Image:90 mile beach.jpg|thumb|right|280px|A familiar [[beach|scene]] on Earth which simultaneously shows the lithosphere, hydrosphere and atmosphere.]]

Some life scientists and earth scientists use ''biosphere'' in a more limited sense. For example, geochemists define the biosphere as being the total sum of living organisms (the &quot;[[biomass (ecology)|biomass]]&quot; or &quot;[[Biota (ecology)|biota]]&quot; as referred to by biologists and ecologists). In this sense, the biosphere is but one of four separate components of the geochemical model, the other three being ''[[lithosphere]]'', ''[[hydrosphere]]'', and ''[[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]]''. The narrow meaning used by geochemists is one of the consequences of specialization in modern science. Some might prefer the word ''ecosphere'', coined in the 1960s, as all encompassing of both biological and physical components of the planet.

The Second International Conference on Closed Life Systems defined ''biospherics'' as the science and technology of analogs and [[model (abstract)|model]]s of [[Earth]]'s biosphere; i.e., artificial Earth-like biospheres. Others may include the creation of artificial non-Earth biospheres&amp;mdash;for example, human-centered biospheres or a native [[Mars|Martian]] biosphere&amp;mdash;in the field of biospherics.

****Gaia hypothesis****
The concept that the biosphere is itself a living organism, either actually or metaphorically, is known as the [[Gaia hypothesis]].

[[James Lovelock]], an atmospheric scientist from the United Kingdom, proposed the Gaia hypothesis to explain how biotic and abiotic factors interact in the biosphere. This hypothesis considers Earth itself a kind of living organism. Its [[atmosphere]], [[geosphere]], and [[hydrosphere]] are cooperating systems that yield a biosphere full of life. In the early 1970s, [[Lynn Margulis]], a microbiologist from the United States, added to the hypothesis, specifically noting the ties between the biosphere and other Earth systems. For example, when [[carbon dioxide]] levels increase in the atmosphere, plants grow more quickly. As their growth continues, they remove more and more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.

Many scientists are now involved in new fields of study that examine interactions between biotic and abiotic factors in the biosphere, such as [[geobiology]] and [[geomicrobiology]].

Ecosystems occur when communities and their physical environment work together as a system. The difference between this and a biosphere is simple, the biosphere is everything in general terms.

==Extent of Earth's biosphere==
[[File:The Earth seen from Apollo 17.jpg|left|250px|thumb|[[Water]] covers 71% of the Earth's surface. Image is the Earth photographed from [[Apollo 17]].]]

Every part of the planet, from the [[polar region|polar]] ice caps to the [[Equator]], supports life of some kind. Recent advances in [[microbiology]] have demonstrated that microbes live deep beneath the Earth's terrestrial surface, and that the total mass of [[microbial]] life in so-called &quot;uninhabitable zones&quot; may, in biomass, exceed all animal and plant life on the surface. The actual thickness of the biosphere on earth is difficult to measure. Birds typically fly at altitudes of 650 to 1,800 meters, and fish that live deep underwater can be found down to -8,372 meters in the [[Puerto Rico Trench]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Campbell 2006&quot; /&gt;

There are more extreme examples for life on the planet: [[Rüppell's Vulture]] has been found at altitudes of 11,300 meters; [[bar-headed Goose|Bar-headed Geese]] migrate at altitudes of at least 8,300 meters; [[yak]]s live at elevations between 3,200 to 5,400 meters above sea level; [[mountain goat]]s live up to 3,050 meters. Herbivorous animals at these elevations depend on lichens, grasses, and herbs.

Microscopic organisms live at such extremes that, taking them into consideration puts the thickness of the biosphere much greater. Culturable microbes have been found in the Earth's upper atmosphere as high as {{convert|41|km|0|abbr=on}} (Wainwright et al., 2003, in FEMS Microbiology Letters). It is unlikely, however, that microbes are active at such altitudes, where temperatures and air pressure are extremely low and ultraviolet radiation very high. More likely these microbes were brought into the upper atmosphere by winds or possibly volcanic eruptions. [[Piezophile|Barophilic]] marine microbes have been found at more than {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}} depth in the [[Marianas Trench]] (Takamia et al., 1997, in FEMS Microbiology Letters). Microbes are not limited to the air, water or the Earth's surface. Culturable thermophilic microbes have been extracted from cores drilled more than {{convert|5|km|0|abbr=on}} into the [[Earth's crust]] in Sweden (Gold, 1992, and Szewzyk, 1994, both in PNAS), from rocks between 65-75 °C. Temperature [[geothermal gradient|increases with increasing depth]] into the Earth's crust. The speed at which the temperature increases depends on many factors, including type of crust (continental vs. oceanic), rock type, geographic location, etc. The upper known limit of temperature at which microbial life can exist is 122 °C (''[[Methanopyrus kandleri]]'' Strain 116), and it is likely that the limit of life in the &quot;deep biosphere&quot; is defined by temperature rather than absolute depth.

Our biosphere is divided into a number of [[biome]]s, inhabited by broadly similar [[flora (plants)|flora]] and [[fauna (animals)|fauna]]. On land, biomes are separated primarily by [[latitude]]. Terrestrial biomes lying within the [[Arctic Circle|Arctic]] and [[Antarctic Circle]]s are relatively barren of [[plant]] and [[animal]] life, while most of the more populous biomes lie near the [[equator]]. Terrestrial organisms in temperate and Arctic biomes have relatively small amounts of total biomass, smaller energy budgets, and display prominent adaptations to cold, including world-spanning migrations, social adaptations, [[homeothermy]], [[estivation]] and multiple layers of insulation.

==Specific biospheres==
When the word is followed by a number, it is usually referring to a specific system or number. Thus:

* Biosphere 1, the planet [[Earth]]
* [[Biosphere 2]], a laboratory in Arizona which contains 3.15 acres (13,000 m²) of closed ecosystem.
* [[BIOS-3]], a closed ecosystem at the Institute of Biophysics in [[Krasnoyarsk]], [[Siberia]], in what was then the [[Soviet Union]].
* Biosphere J (CEEF, Closed Ecology Experiment Facilities), an experiment in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Nakano ''et al.''(1998)&quot;[http://ci.nii.ac.jp/naid/110002396764/ Dynamic Simulation of Pressure Control System for the Closed Ecology Experiment Facility]&quot;, ''Transactions of the Japan Society of Mechanical Engineers.''

A '''biological membrane''' or '''biomembrane''' is an enclosing or separating 
[[Membrane (selective barrier)|membrane]] that acts as a selective barrier, within or around a [[cell (biology)|cell]]. It consist of a [[lipid bilayer]] with embedded [[integral membrane protein|proteins]] that may constitute close to 50% of membrane content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Neurophysiological basis of movement|author=Mark L. Latash|year=2007|isbn=0736063676}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cellular membranes should not be confused with isolating [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]] formed by layers of cells, such as [[mucous membrane|mucous]] and [[Basement membrane|basement]] membranes.

==Function==
Membranes in cells typically define enclosed spaces or [[cell compartment|compartments]] in which cells may maintain a [[chemistry|chemical]] or [[biochemistry|biochemical]] [[environment (biophysical)|environment]] that differs from the outside.  For example, the membrane around [[peroxisome]]s shields the rest of the cell from [[peroxide]]s, and the cell membrane separates a cell from its surrounding medium. Most [[organelle]]s are defined by such membranes, and are called &quot;membrane-bound&quot; organelles.

Probably the most important feature of a biomembrane is that it is a [[selective permeability|selectively permeable]] structure. This means that the size, [[electric charge|charge]], and other [[chemical properties]] of the [[atoms]] and molecules attempting to cross it will determine whether they succeed in doing so. Selective permeability is essential for effective separation of a cell or organelle from its surroundings. Biological membranes also have certain mechanical or [[Elasticity of cell membranes|elastic properties]].

Particles that are required for cellular function but are unable to diffuse freely across a membrane enter through a [[membrane transport protein]] or are taken in by means of [[endocytosis]].

==Diversity of biological membranes==
Many types of specialized [[plasma membrane]]s can separate cell from external environment: [[apical]], [[basolateral]], [[presynaptic]] and [[postsynaptic]] ones, membranes of [[flagella]], [[cilia]], [[microvillus]], [[filopodia]] and [[lamellipodia]], the [[sarcolemma]] of muscle cells, as well as specialized [[myelin]] and [[dendritic spine]] membranes of [[neurons]]. Plasma membranes can also form different types of &quot;supramembrane&quot; structures such as [[caveola]], [[postsynaptic density]], [[podosome]], [[invadopodium]], [[desmosome]], [[hemidesmosome]], [[focal adhesion]], and [[cell junctions]]. These types of membranes differ in lipid and protein composition. 

Distinct types of membranes also create intracellular [[organelle]]s: [[endosome]]; smooth and rough [[endoplasmic reticulum]] ; [[sarcoplasmic reticulum]]; [[Golgi apparatus]]; [[lysosome]]; [[mitochondrion]] (inner and outer membranes); [[cell nucleus|nucleus]] (inner and outer membranes); [[peroxisome]]; [[vacuole]]; cytoplasmic [[Granule (cell biology)|granule]]s; cell [[Vesicle (biology)|vesicles]] ([[phagosome]], [[autophagosome]], [[clathrin-coated vesicles]], COPI-coated and COPII-coated vesicles) and [[secretory vesicles]] (including [[synaptosome]], [[acrosome]]s, [[melanosomes]], and [[chromaffin granule]]s).

Different types of biological membranes have diverse lipid and protein compositions. The content of membranes defines their physical and biological properties. Some components of membranes play a key role in medicine, such as the efflux pumps that pump drugs out of a cell.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Balfour Declaration of 1926''', a report resulting from the [[1926 Imperial Conference]] of [[British Empire]] leaders in [[London]], was named after the [[United Kingdom|British]] statesman [[Arthur Balfour]], first Earl of Balfour, [[Lord President of the Council]] and a previous [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]]. It states, of the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[Dominion]]s:
{{quote|&quot;They are autonomous Communities within the [[British Empire]], equal in status, in no way subordinate one to another in any aspect of their domestic or external affairs, though united by a common allegiance to [[the Crown]], and freely associated as members of the British [[Commonwealth of Nations]].&quot;}}

The Inter-Imperial Relations Committee, chaired by Balfour, drew up the document preparatory to its unanimous approval by the imperial premiers on November 15, 1926.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Balfour Formula&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Marshall |first=Sir Peter |year=2001 |month=September |title=The Balfour Formula and the Evolution of the Commonwealth |journal=[[The Round Table Journal|The Round Table]] |volume=90 |issue=361 |pages=pp. 541–53 |url= |accessdate=2008-12-20 |quote= |doi=10.1080/00358530120082823 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was first proposed by [[South Africa]]n Prime Minister [[J. B. M. Hertzog]] and Canada's [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] at that time, [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]].

The Declaration accepted the growing political and diplomatic independence of the Dominions, in the years after [[World War I]]. It also recommended that the [[Governor-General|governors-general]], the representatives of the King who acted for [[the Crown]] as ''de facto'' head of state in each dominion, should no longer also serve automatically as the representative of the British government in diplomatic relations between the countries. In following years, [[High Commissioner]]s were gradually appointed, whose duties were soon recognised to be virtually identical to those of an [[ambassador]]. The first such British High Commissioner was appointed to [[Ottawa]] in 1928.

The conclusions of the imperial premiers conference of 1926 were restated by the 1930 conference and incorporated in the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]] of December 1931, by which the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British parliament]] renounced any legislative authority over dominion affairs, except as specifically provided in law.

The declaration was made in a letter from [[Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] [[Arthur James Balfour]] to [[Walter Rothschild, 2nd Baron Rothschild|Baron Rothschild]] (Walter Rothschild, 2nd Baron Rothschild), a leader of the British Jewish community, for transmission to the [[Zionist]] [[Zionist Federation of Great Britain and Ireland|Federation of Great Britain and Ireland]]. The letter reflected the position of the [[British Cabinet]], as agreed upon in a meeting on 31 October 1917. It further stated that the declaration is a sign of ''&quot;sympathy with Jewish Zionist aspirations.&quot;''

The statement was issued through the efforts of [[Chaim Weizmann]] and [[Nahum Sokolow]], the principal Zionist leaders based in [[London]]; as they had asked for the reconstitution of Palestine as “the” [[Jewish]] national home, the declaration fell short of Zionist expectations.&lt;ref&gt;Balfour Declaration. (2007). In Encyclopædia Britannica.  Retrieved August 12, 2007, from [http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9011963 Encyclopædia Britannica Online].&lt;/ref&gt;

The &quot;Balfour Declaration&quot; was later incorporated into the [[Treaty of Sèvres|Sèvres peace treaty]] with [[Turkey]] and the [[British Mandate of Palestine|Mandate for Palestine]]. The original document is kept at the [[British Library]].

The anniversary of the declaration, 2 November, is widely commemorated in [[Israel]] and among [[Jew]]s in the [[Jewish diaspora]] as Balfour Day.

The declaration, a typed letter signed in ink by Balfour, reads as follows:

November&amp;nbsp;2nd, 1917.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Dear Lord Rothschild,
&lt;br&gt;
I have much pleasure in conveying to you, on behalf of His Majesty's Government, the following declaration of sympathy with Jewish Zionist aspirations which has been submitted to, and approved by, the Cabinet:
&lt;br&gt;
&quot;His Majesty's Government view with favour the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people, and will use their best endeavours to facilitate the achievement of this object, it being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine, or the rights and political status enjoyed by Jews in any other country&quot;.

&lt;br&gt;
I should be grateful if you would bring this declaration to the knowledge of the Zionist Federation.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Yours sincerely&lt;br&gt;

==Background==
In 1896, [[Theodor Herzl]], a Jewish journalist living in Austria-Hungary, published ''Der Judenstaat'' (&quot;The Jewish State&quot;), in which he asserted that the only solution to the &quot;[[Jewish Question]]&quot; in Europe, including growing antisemitism, was through the establishment of a Jewish State. Political Zionism had just been born.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Isaiah. &quot;Herzl, Theodor.&quot; Encyclopaedia Judaica. Ed. Michael Berenbaum and Fred Skolnik. 2nd ed. Vol. 9. Detroit: Macmillan Reference USA, 2007. 54-66. Gale Virtual Reference Library. Web. 15 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; A year later, Herzl founded the [[World Zionist Organization|Zionist Organization]] (ZO), which at its [[First Zionist Congress|first congress]], &quot;called for the establishment of a home for the Jewish people in [[Palestine]] secured under public law&quot;. Serviceable means to attain that goal included the promotion of Jewish settlement there, the organization of Jews in the [[Jewish Diaspora|diaspora]], the strengthening of Jewish feeling and consciousness, and preparatory steps to attain those necessary governmental grants.&lt;ref&gt;Avish, Shimon. &quot;Herzl, Theodor [1860–1904].&quot; Encyclopedia of the Modern Middle East and North Africa. Ed. Philip Mattar. 2nd ed. Vol. 2. New York: Macmillan Reference USA, 2004. 1021-1022. Gale Virtual Reference Library. Web. 15 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the First World War, Great Britain had the [[British Mandate for Palestine]]. The issuance of the Balfour Declaration greatly increased the immigration of Jews to Palestine. In 1947, Great Britain decided to turn its Mandate over to the United Nations, which, in the same year, adopted [[Resolution 181]], partitioning the land into two states, one Arab and one Jewish.

The [[Yishuv|Jewish community]] agreed to the partition, but Arab countries and Palestinian Arabs did not, resulting in the [[1948 Arab-Israeli War]], the first in a series of wars fought between Israel and the Arab world. It took thirty years for an Arab country to recognize Israel: through United States mediation during the 1978 [[Camp David Accords]], Israeli Prime Minister Begin and Egyptian President Sadat signed a peace treaty. &quot;The Arab world reacted angrily to Egypt's separate peace with Israel and refused to endorse or participate in it. The Arab League moved its headquarters from Cairo and most of its members broke ties with Egypt, ushering in nearly a decade of Egyptian isolation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Eisenberg, Laura Z. &quot;Egyptian–Israeli Peace Treaty (1979).&quot;  Encyclopedia of the Modern Middle East and North Africa. Ed. Philip Mattar. 2nd ed. Vol. 2. New York: Macmillan Reference USA, 2004. 770-771. Gale Virtual Reference Library. Web. 15 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Sadat was assassinated by Egyptian fundamentalists in 1981.

==Text development and differing views==
In 1919 the General Secretary (and future President) of the Zionist Organization, Nahum Sokolow, published a History of Zionism (1600-1918). Sokolow represented the Zionist Organization at the Paris Peace Conference. He explained:&lt;blockquote&gt;The object of Zionism is to establish for the Jewish people a home in Palestine secured by public law.&quot; ... ...It has been said and is still being obstinately repeated by anti-Zionists again and again, that Zionism aims at the creation of an independent &quot;Jewish State&quot; But this is wholly fallacious. The &quot;Jewish State&quot; was never part of the Zionist programme. The Jewish State was the title of Herzl's first pamphlet, which had the supreme merit of forcing people to think. This pamphlet was followed by the first Zionist Congress, which accepted the Basle programme - the only programme in existence.&lt;ref&gt;See History of Zionism (1600-1918), Volume I, Nahum Sokolow, 1919 Longmans, Green, and Company, London, pages xxiv-xxv&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The records of discussions that led up to the final text of the Balfour Declaration clarifies some details of its wording. The phrase &quot;national home&quot; was intentionally used instead of &quot;state&quot; because of opposition to the Zionist program within the British Cabinet. Both the Zionist Organization and the British government devoted efforts over the following decades, including [[Winston Churchill]]'s [[Churchill White Paper, 1922|1922 White Paper]], to denying that a state was the intention.&lt;ref&gt;See the report of the United Nations Special Committee on Palestine, UN Document A/364, 3 September 1947&lt;/ref&gt; However, in private, many British officials agreed with the interpretation of the Zionists that a state would be established when a Jewish majority was achieved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

The initial draft of the declaration, contained in a letter sent by Rothschild to Balfour, referred to the principle ''&quot;that Palestine should be reconstituted as the National Home of the Jewish people.&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the final text, the word ''that'' was replaced with ''in'' to avoid committing the entirety of Palestine to this purpose. Similarly, an early draft did not include the commitment that nothing should be done which might prejudice the rights of the non-Jewish communities. These changes came about partly as the result of the urgings of [[Edwin Samuel Montagu]], an influential [[anti-Zionist]] Jew and [[Secretary of State for India|secretary of state for India]], who was concerned that the declaration without those changes could result in increased [[anti-Semitic]] persecution. The draft was circulated and during October the government received replies from various representatives of the Jewish community. Lord Rothschild took exception to the new proviso on the basis that it presupposed the possibility of a danger to non-Zionists, which he denied.&lt;ref&gt;Palestine Papers 1917-1922, Doreen Ingrams, page 13&lt;/ref&gt;

At that time the [[British Empire|British]] were busy making promises. At a War Cabinet meeting, held on 31 October 1917, Balfour suggested that a declaration favorable to Zionist aspirations would allow Great Britain ''&quot;to carry on extremely useful [[propaganda]] both in [[Russia]] and [[United States|America]]&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;Palestine Papers 1917-1922, Doreen Ingrams, page 16&lt;/ref&gt; The British later dropped Balfour Declaration leaflets over [[Germany]], which were written in [[Yiddish]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.totallyjewish.com/news/national/c-7480/90th-anniversary-of-balfour-declaration/ 90th Anniversary Of Balfour Declaration]&lt;/ref&gt;

===The McMahon–Hussein Correspondence===
{{Main|McMahon–Hussein Correspondence#The territorial reservations |l1=McMahon–Hussein Correspondence}}
Henry McMahon had [[McMahon-Hussein Correspondence|exchanged letters]] with [[Hussein bin Ali, Sharif of Mecca]] in 1915, in which he had promised Hussein control of [[Arab]] lands with the exception of ''&quot;portions of [[Syria]]&quot;'' lying to the west of ''&quot;the districts of [[Damascus]], [[Homs]], [[Hama]] and [[Aleppo]]&quot;''. Palestine lies to the south of these areas and wasn't explicitly mentioned. That modern-day Lebanese region of the [[Mediterranean]] coast was set aside as part of a future French Mandate. After the war the extent of the coastal exclusion was hotly disputed. Hussein had protested that the Arabs of [[Beirut]] would greatly oppose isolation from the Arab state or states, but did not bring up the matter of [[Jerusalem]] or Palestine. Dr. [[Chaim Weizmann]] wrote in his autobiography ''Trial and Error'' that Palestine had been excluded from the areas that should have been Arab and independent. This interpretation was supported explicitly by the [[British government]] in the 1922 White Paper.

On the basis of McMahon's assurances the Arab Revolt began on 5 June 1916. However, the British and French also secretly concluded the [[Sykes–Picot Agreement]] on 16 May 1916.&lt;ref name=Khouri&gt;Khouri, Fred John (1985).  The Arab-Israeli Dilemma. Syracuse University Press. ISBN 9780815623403, pp. 8-10.&lt;/ref&gt; This agreement divided many Arab territories into British- and French-administered areas and allowed for the internationalisation of Palestine.&lt;ref name=Khouri/&gt; Hussein learned of the agreement when it was leaked by the new Russian government in December 1917, but was satisfied by two disingenuous telegrams from Sir [[Reginald Wingate]], High Commissioner of Egypt, assuring him that the British government's commitments to the Arabs were still valid and that the Sykes-Picot Agreement was not a formal treaty.&lt;ref name=Khouri/&gt;

According to Isaiah Friedman, Hussein was not perturbed by the Balfour Declaration and on March 23, 1918, in ''Al Qibla'', the daily newspaper of Mecca, with Hussein writing:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.peaceforourtime.org.uk/page166a.html&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|The return of these exiles [jaliya] to their homeland will prove materially and spiritually an experimental school for their [Arab] brethren who are with them in the fields, factories, trades and all things connected to the land.}}

He called on the Arab population in Palestine to welcome the Jews as brethren and cooperate with them for the common welfare.&lt;ref&gt;Palestine, a Twice-promised Land?: The British, the Arabs &amp; Zionism, 1915-1920 By Isaiah Friedman, page 171&lt;/ref&gt; Following the publication of the Declaration the British had dispatched Commander [[David George Hogarth]] to see Hussein in January 1918 bearing [[McMahon–Hussein_Correspondence#The_Hogarth_Message|the message]] that the &quot;political and economic freedom&quot; of the Palestinian population was not in question.&lt;ref name=Khouri/&gt; Hogarth reported that Hussein &quot;would not accept an independent Jewish State in Palestine, nor was I instructed to warn him that such a state was contemplated by Great Britain&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Huneidi, Sahar (2000). ''A Broken Trust: Herbert Samuel, Zionism and the Palestinians, 1920-1925''. IB Tauris. ISBN 1860641725, p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; Continuing Arab disquiet over Allied intentions also led during 1918 to the British [[Declaration to the Seven]] and the [[Anglo-French Declaration]], the latter promising &quot;the complete and final liberation of the peoples who have for so long been oppressed by the Turks, and the setting up of national governments and administrations deriving their authority from the free exercise of the initiative and choice of the indigenous populations.&quot;&lt;ref name=Khouri/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/4C4F7515DC39195185256CF7006F878C Report of a Committee Set up to Consider Certain Correspondence Between Sir Henry McMahon and the Sharif of Mecca in 1915 and 1916], UNISPAL, Annex A, paragraph 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lord Grey had been the [[Foreign Secretary|foreign secretary]] during the McMahon-Hussein negotiations. Speaking in the [[House of Lords]] on the 27th March 1923, he made it clear that he entertained serious doubts as to the validity of the British government's interpretation of the pledges which he, as foreign secretary, had caused to be given to Hussein in 1915. He called for all of the secret engagements regarding Palestine to be made public.&lt;ref&gt;[http://domino.un.org/unispal.nsf/3d14c9e5cdaa296d85256cbf005aa3eb/4c4f7515dc39195185256cf7006f878c!OpenDocument Report of a Committee Set Up To Consider Certain Correspondence Between Sir Henry McMahon and The Sharif of Mecca]&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the relevant documents in the National Archives were later declassified and published. Among them were the minutes of a Cabinet Eastern Committee meeting, chaired by [[Lord Curzon]],which was held on 5 December 1918. Balfour was in attendance. The minutes revealed that in laying out the government's position Curzon had explained that: ''&quot;Palestine was included in the areas as to which Great Britain pledged itself that they should be Arab and independent in the future&quot;''.&lt;ref&gt;cited in Palestine Papers, 1917-1922, Doreen Ingrams, page 48 from the UK Archive files PRO CAB 27/24.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Negotiation==
One of the main proponents of a Jewish homeland in Palestine was Weizmann, the leading spokesperson for organized [[Zionism]] in Britain. Weizmann was a chemist who had developed a process to synthesize [[acetone]] via [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]]. Acetone is required for the production of [[cordite]], a powerful [[propellant]] explosive needed to fire ammunition without generating tell-tale smoke. Germany had cornered supplies of [[calcium acetate]], a major source of acetone. Other pre-war processes in Britain were inadequate to meet the increased demand in [[World War I]], and a shortage of cordite would have severely hampered Britain's war effort. [[David Lloyd-George|Lloyd-George]], then minister for munitions, was grateful to Weizmann and so supported his Zionist aspirations. In his ''War Memoirs'', Lloyd-George wrote of meeting Weizmann in 1916 that Weizmann
:... explained his aspirations as to the repatriation of the Jews to the sacred land they had made famous.  That was the fount and origin of the famous declaration about the National Home for the Jews in Palestine .... As soon as I became Prime Minister I talked the whole matter over with Mr Balfour, who was then Foreign Secretary.

However, this version of the story of the declaration's origins has been described as &quot;fanciful&quot;, a fair assessment considering that discussions between Weizmann and Balfour had begun at least a decade earlier. In late 1905 Balfour had requested of Charles Dreyfus, his Jewish constituency representative, that he arrange a meeting with Weizman, during which Weizman asked for official British support for Zionism; they were to meet again on this issue in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;Harry Defries, ''Conservative Party Attitudes to Jews 1900-1950'', Routledge, 2001, ISBN 0714652210. pp.50-51.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the first meeting between Weizmann and Balfour in 1906, Balfour asked what Weizmann's objections were to the idea of a Jewish homeland in [[Uganda]], (the [[Uganda Protectorate]] in [[East Africa]] in the [[British Uganda Programme]]), rather than in Palestine. According to Weizmann's memoir, the conversation went as follows:
:&quot;Mr. Balfour, supposing I was to offer you Paris instead of London, would you take it?&quot; He sat up, looked at me, and answered: &quot;But Dr. Weizmann, we have London.&quot; &quot;That is true,&quot; I said, &quot;but we had Jerusalem when London was a marsh.&quot;  He ... said two things which I remember vividly.  The first was: &quot;Are there many Jews who think like you?&quot;  I answered: &quot;I believe I speak the mind of millions of Jews whom you will never see and who cannot speak for themselves.&quot;  ... To this he said: &quot;If that is so you will one day be a force.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Weizmann, ''Trial and Error'', p.111, as quoted in W. Lacquer, ''The History of Zionism&quot;, 2003, ISBN 1860649327. p.188&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James L. Gelvin|James Gelvin]], a Middle East history professor, cites at least three other reasons for why the British government chose to support Zionist aspirations. Issuing the Balfour Declaration would appeal to Woodrow Wilson’s two closest advisors, who were avid Zionists.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;The British did not know quite what to make of President Woodrow Wilson and his conviction (before America's entrance into the war) that the way to end hostilities was for both sides to accept &quot;peace without victory.&quot; Two of Wilson's closest advisors, Louis Brandeis and Felix Frankfurter, were avid Zionists. How better to shore up an uncertain ally than by endorsing Zionist aims? The British adopted similar thinking when it came to the Russians, who were in the midst of their revolution. Several of the most prominent revolutionaries, including Leon Trotsky, were of Jewish descent. Why not see if they could be persuaded to keep Russia in the way by appealing to their latent Jewishness and giving them another reason to continue the fight?&quot; ... These include not only those already mentioned but also Britain's desire to attract Jewish financial resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

==Conflicts and broken treaty commitments (contradictory assurances)==&lt;!--in case of title change, linked from History of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict#Origins--&gt;
The [[wikisource: Anglo-French Declaration|Anglo-French Declaration of November 1918]] pledged that Great Britain and France would &quot;assist in the establishment of indigenous governments and administrations in Syria and Mesopotamia by &quot;setting up of national governments and administrations deriving their authority from the free exercise of the initiative and choice of the indigenous populations&quot;.

Balfour resigned as foreign secretary following the Versailles Conference in 1919, but continued in the Cabinet as [[Lord President of the Council|lord president of the council]]. In a memorandum addressed to new Foreign Secretary Lord Curzon, he stated that the Balfour Declaration contradicted the letters of the covenant (referring to the [[Covenant of the League of Nations|League Covenant]]) the Anglo-French Declaration, and the instructions to the [[King-Crane Commission]]. All of the other engagements contained pledges that the Arab populations could establish national governments of their own choosing according to the principle of self-determination.

Balfour explained:&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;The contradiction between the letters of the Covenant [of the League of Nations] and the policy of the Allies is even more flagrant in the case of the ‘independent nation’ of Palestine than in that of the ‘independent nation‘ of Syria. For in Palestine we do not propose to even go through the form of consulting the wishes of the present inhabitants of the country though the American [King-Crane] Commission is going through the form of asking what they are.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Four Great Powers [Britain, France, Italy and the United States] are committed to Zionism. And Zionism, be it right or wrong, good or bad, is rooted in age-long traditions, in present needs, and future hopes, of far profounder import than the desires and prejudices of the 700,000 Arabs who now inhabit that ancient land. In my opinion that is right.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt; What I have never been able to understand is how it can be harmonized with the [Anglo-French] declaration, the Covenant, or the instruction to the [King-Crane] Commission of Enquiry.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I do not think that Zionism will hurt the Arabs, but they will never say they want it. Whatever be the future of Palestine it is not now an ‘independent nation’, nor is it yet on the way to become one. Whatever deference should be paid to the views of those living there, the Powers in their selection of a mandatory do not propose, as I understand the matter, to consult them. In short, so far as Palestine is concerned, the Powers have made no statement of fact which is not admittedly wrong, and no declaration of policy which, at least in the letter, they have not always intended to violate.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;If Zionism is to influence the Jewish problem throughout the world Palestine must be made available for the largest number of Jewish immigrants. It is therefore eminently desirable that it should obtain the command of the water-power
which naturally belongs to it whether by extending its borders to the north, or by treaty with the mandatory of Syria, to whom the southward flowing waters of Hamon could not in any event be of much value.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;For the same reason Palestine should be extended into the lands lying east of the Jordan. It should not, however, be allowed to include the Hedjaz Railway, which is too distinctly bound up with exclusively Arab Interests...&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=''Question of Palestine''|author=Edward Said|publisher=Vintage Books Edition|year=1992|page=16|isbn=0679739882}}, {{Cite book|title=''Palestine Papers 1917-1922''|author=Doreen Ingrams|publisher=George Braziller Edition|year=1973|page=73|isbn=0807606480}} Documents on British Foreign Policy 1919-1931, First series Vol 4. page 345 memorandum from Lord Balfour to Lord Curzon, August 11, 1919, and quoted by [http://www.positivepractices.com/PeaceEducation/TheOriginofthePalestine-I.html The Origin of the Palestine-Israeli Conflict] 2nd Edition, 2002, Jews for Justice.

==Controversy behind declaration==
British public and government opinion became increasingly less favorable to the commitment that had been made to [[Zionist]] policy. In February 1922, Winston Churchill telegraphed Herbert Samuel asking for cuts in expenditure and noting:&lt;ref&gt;CO 733/18, Churchill to Samuel, Telegram, Private and Personal, 25 February 1922. Cited Huneidi, Sahar &quot;A Broken Trust, Herbert Samuel, Zionism and the Palestinians&quot; 2001, ISBN 1-86064-172-5, p.57.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;In both Houses of Parliament there is growing movement of hostility, against Zionist policy in Palestine, which will be stimulated by recent [[Alfred Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Northcliffe|Northcliffe]] [http://books.google.com.ph/books?id=xZD_ZswA-VgC&amp;pg=PA103&amp;lpg=PA103&amp;dq=%22Northcliffe%22+1922%22+%22Palestine%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=BFqVExPUH2&amp;sig=Y1OS-u6Hdz6iy35L3i82bxj6pM0&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=o2w1TP-1N4S7rAeY_cmlAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Northcliffe%22%201922%22%20%22Palestine%22&amp;f=false articles]. I do not attach undue importance to this movement, but it is increasingly difficult to meet the argument that it is unfair to ask the British taxpayer, already overwhelmed with taxation, to bear the cost of imposing on Palestine an unpopular policy.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sir John Evelyn Shuckburgh of the new Middle East department of the Foreign Office discovered that the correspondence prior to the declaration was not available in the Colonial Office, 'although Foreign Office papers were understood to have been lengthy and to have covered a considerable period'.&quot; The 'most comprehensive explanation' of the origin of the Balfour Declaration the Foreign Office was able to provide was contained in a small 'unofficial' note of Jan 1923 affirming that:&lt;blockquote&gt;little is known of how the policy represented by the Declaration was first given form. Four, or perhaps five men were chiefly concerned in the labour-the Earl of Balfour, the late Sir Mark Sykes, and Messrs. Weizmann and Sokolow, with perhaps Lord Rothschild as a figure in the background. Negotiations seem to have been mainly oral and by means of private notes and memoranda of which only the scantiest records seem to be available.&lt;ref&gt;Full text of note included CO 733/58, Secret Cabinet Paper CP 60 (23), 'Palestine and the Balfour Declaration, January 1923. FO unofficial note added 'little referring to the Balfour Declaration among such papers as have been preserved'. Shuckburgh's memo asserts that 'as the official records are silent, it can only be assumed that such discussions as had taken place were of an informal and private character'.[http://books.google.com/books?id=sY27UmuT6-4C&amp;pg=PA256&amp;lpg=PA256&amp;dq=co+%22733+58%22+secret+cabinet+paper+cp+60&amp;source=web&amp;ots=cudKSJZW-n&amp;sig=iDIviioqWIqE41CINYsHkdime4w]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In his posthumously published 1981 book ''[[The Anglo-American Establishment]]'', [[Georgetown University]] history professor [[Carroll Quigley]] explained that the Balfour Declaration was actually drafted by [[Alfred Milner|Lord Alfred Milner]]. Quigley wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
This declaration, which is always known as the Balfour Declaration, should rather be called &quot;the Milner Declaration,&quot; since Milner was the actual draftsman and was, apparently, its chief supporter in the War Cabinet. This fact was not made public until 21 July 1937. At that time Ormsby-Gore, speaking for the government in Commons, said, &quot;The draft as originally put up by Lord Balfour was not the final draft approved by the War Cabinet. The particular draft assented to by the War Cabinet and afterwards by the Allied Governments and by the United States...and finally embodied in the Mandate, happens to have been drafted by Lord Milner. The actual final draft had to be issued in the name of the Foreign Secretary, but the actual draftsman was Lord Milner.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

More recently, [[William D. Rubinstein]], Professor of Modern History at [[Aberystwyth University]], Wales, wrote that [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] politician and pro-Zionist [[Leo Amery]], as [[Assistant Secretary]] to the British war cabinet in 1917, was the main author of the Balfour Declaration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=William D.

==Arab opposition==
The Arabs expressed disapproval in November 1918 at the parade marking the first anniversary of the Balfour Declaration. The [[Muslim-Christian Association]] protested the carrying of new &quot;white and blue banners with two inverted triangles in the middle&quot;. They drew the attention of the authorities to the serious consequences of any political implications in raising the banners.&lt;ref&gt;Zu'aytir, Akram, Watha'iq al-haraka a-wataniyya al-filastiniyya (1918-1939), ed.

Later that month, on the first anniversary of the occupation of [[Jaffa]] by the British, the Muslim-Christian Association sent a lengthy memorandum and petition to the military governor protesting once more any formation of a Jewish state.&lt;ref&gt;'Petition from the Moslem-Christian Association in Jaffa, to the Military Governor, on the occasion of the First Anniversary of British Entry into Jaffa', 16 November 1918, Zu'aytir papers pp. 7-8.

'''Black Hand''' ([[Serbian language|Serbian]]: Црна рука, ''Crna ruka''), is an unofficial name for the [[secret society|secret military society]] in the [[Serbian army]] in the [[Kingdom of Serbia]], which was founded on September 6, 1901.&lt;ref name=&quot;AB&quot;&gt;Antić, Antonije: Notes, Museum of city Zaječer, Zaječar, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; It was a part of the [[Greater-Serbia]] movement, with the intention of uniting all of the territories containing [[Serb]] populations annexed by [[Austria-Hungary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== History ==
[[File:Black Hand seal.gif|thumb|250px|left|Black Hand seal.]]
The Black Hand was founded on September 6, 1901.&lt;ref name=&quot;AB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BB&quot;&gt;Antonije Antić:[http://www.novosti.rs/dodatni_sadrzaj/clanci.119.html:308440-Skola-gnezdo-zavere ''School's nest of conspiracy''], Evening news, feuilleton, 20 November 2010 (Serbian)&lt;/ref&gt; Then was the first meeting of the conspirators. At the meeting were: Captain Radomir Aranđelović, Capt. Milan F. Petrović, Capt. [[Dragutin Dimitrijević]], Lieutenant [[Antonije Antić]],  Lt. Dragutin Dulić, Lt. Milan Marinković and Lt. Nikodije Popović.&lt;ref name=&quot;AB&quot;/&gt; They made a plan to kill the royal couple, [[Aleksandar Obrenović]] and [[Draga Mašin]]. The birthday of Queen Draga was September 11, 1901, and on this occasion it was envisaged to hold a party at the palace Kolarac.&lt;ref name=&quot;AB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BB&quot;/&gt; The main weapons of assassination chosen were knives soaked in poison. They made a plan: two conspirators turn off power on the electric power station, one at the palace Kolarac, and the remaining four to be in the hall and follow the movement of Aleksandar and Draga. Two, of those four in the hall burn down the curtains, and the other two conspirators with knives to stab the royal couple. This plan failed because the royal couple did not arrive at the party.
Foreign Affairs correspondent [[Cyrus Leo Sulzberger II|C. L. Sulzberger]] asserts that the Black Hand was actually formed already in 1903 when it backed the [[May Overthrow|assassination]] of King [[Alexander I of Serbia]] and his consort [[Draga Obrenović|Draga]]; he further states that Captain [[Dragutin Dimitrijevic Apis]] who had personally led the group of Army officers who killed the royal couple in the [[Old Palace (Belgrade)|Old Palace]] at [[Belgrade]] on the night of May 28/29, 1903 ([[Old Style]]), was also the Black Hand's leader.&lt;ref&gt;C. L. Sulzberger ''The Fall of Eagles'', 1977, Crown Publisher's, Inc., New York, pp.202, 221&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 8, 1908, just two days after Austria annexed Bosnia and Herzegovina, many men, some of them ranking Serbian ministers, officials and generals, held a meeting at City Hall in Belgrade. They founded a semi-secret society—[[Narodna Odbrana]]  (National Defense) which gave the [[Greater Serbia]] idea a focus and an organization. The purpose of the group was to liberate Serbs under the control of Austria-Hungary. They also undertook anti-Austrian propaganda and organized spies and saboteurs to operate within the empire's provinces. Satellite groups were formed in Slovenia, Bosnia, Herzegovina and Istria. The Bosnian group went under the name Mlada Bosna—[[Young Bosnia]].
In 1909, Austria pressured the Serbian government to put a stop to their anti-Austrian insurrection. Russia was not ready to stand fully behind Serbia should things come to a showdown, so Belgrade was grudgingly forced to comply. From then on, Narodna Odbrana concentrated on education and propaganda within Serbia, trying to fashion itself as a cultural organization.

=== The Birth of the Black Hand ===
[[File:Ritual cross the Black Hands.jpg|thumb|250px|Ritual cross the Black Hands]]
[[File:The funeral of the royal couple in 1903.jpg|thumb|250px|The funeral of the royal couple [[Aleksandar Obrenović]] and [[Draga Mašin]] on May 29, 1903 after [[May Overthrow]]]]
Many members formed a new, and again secret, organization to continue the terrorist actions. Ten men met on May 9, 1911 to form Ujedinjenje ili Smrt (Union or Death), also known as The Black Hand. The seal of their group is reproduced to the right.
By 1914, there were several hundred members, perhaps as many as 2500. Many members were Serbian army officers. The professed goal of the group was the creation of a Greater Serbia, by use of violence, if necessary. The Black Hand trained guerillas and saboteurs and planned political murders. The Black Hand was organized at the grassroots level in 3- to 5-member cells, supervised by district committees and by a Central committee in Belgrade whose ten-member Executive Committee was led, more or less, by Colonel [[Dragutin Dimitrijevic]] (also known as Apis). To ensure secrecy, members rarely knew much more than the members of their own cell and one superior above them. New members swore &quot;I (...), by entering into the society, do hereby swear by the Sun which shineth upon me, by the Earth which feedeth me, by God, by the blood of my forefathers, by my honour and by my life, that from this moment onward and until my death, I shall faithfully serve the task of this organisation and that I shall at all times be prepared to bear for it any sacrifice. I further swear by God, by my honour and by my life, that I shall unconditionally carry into effect all its orders and commands. I further swear by my God, by my honour and by my life, that I shall keep within myself all the secrets of this organisation and carry them with me into my grave. May God and my brothers in this organisation be my judges if at any time I should wittingly fail or break this oath.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pressonline.rs/sr/vesti/magazin/story/56166/Tadi%C4%87ev+deda+bio+zadu%C5%BEen+za+ubistvo+Ferdinanda!.html Pressonline.rs]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Black Hand took over the terrorist actions of Narodna Odbrana , and worked deliberately at obscuring any distinctions between the two groups, trading on the prestige and network of the older organization. Black Hand members held important army and government positions. [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia|Crown Prince Alexander]] was an enthusiastic and financial supporter.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} The group held influence over government appointment and policy. The Serbian government was fairly well informed of Black Hand activities.
Friendly relations had fairly well cooled by 1914. The Black Hand was displeased with Prime minister Nikola Pašić. They thought he did not act aggressively enough towards the Pan-Serb cause. They engaged in a bitter power struggle over several issues, such as who would control territories Serbia annexed in the Balkan Wars. By this point, standing up and saying 'no' to the Black Hand was a dangerous act. Political murder was one of their well known tools.

It was also in 1914 that Apis decided that Archduke Franz Ferdinand, the heir-apparent of Austria, should be assassinated. Towards that end, three young Bosnian-Serbs were recruited and trained in bomb throwing and marksmanship. [[Gavrilo Princip]], [[Nedeljko Čabrinović]] and [[Trifko Grabež]] were smuggled across the border back into Bosnia via a chain of [[Underground_Railroad|underground-railroad]] style contacts.
The decision to kill the Archduke was apparently initiated by Apis, and not sanctioned by the full Executive Committee. Those involved probably realized that their plot would invite war between Austria and Serbia. They had every reason to expect that Russia would side with Serbia. In all likelihood, they did not anticipate that their little war would mushroom into world war.
Others in the government and some on the Black Hand Executive Council were not as confident of Russian aid. Russia had let them down recently. When word of the plot percolated through Black Hand leadership and the Serbian government, Apis was told not to proceed. He made a half-hearted attempt to intercept the young assassins at the border, but they had already crossed. This 'recall' appears to make Apis look like a loose cannon, and the young assassins as independent zealots. In fact, the 'recall' took place a full two weeks before the Archduke's visit. The assassins idled around in Sarajevo for a month. Nothing more was done to stop them.

=== The Assassination ===
{{main|Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria}}

After [[Nedeljko Čabrinović]]'s first unsuccessful attack, Princip succeeded in killing the Archduke. Until a few weeks later, the guilt for the crime had settled loosely on Serbia in general. Tensions between Serbia and Austria eventually drew in the other European powers and escalated into world war.
Towards the end of 1916, Prime Minister Pasic decided to destroy the leaders of the Black Hand and break up the organization. By the spring of 1917, many Black Hand leaders, including Apis, had been arrested.
A sham trial before a military tribunal in [[Salonika]] was held in May 1917 for Apis and others. Among the charges was that the Black Hand had attempted to murder Prince Regent Alexander. Though witnesses against them were numerous, the evidence cited was nearly all hearsay or outright fabrications. Apis and six others were sentenced to death. Three obtained commutations to long prison terms, but Apis and three comrades were executed by firing squad on June 26, 1917.

With the demise of the Black Hand in June 1917 after the Salonika Trial, [[White Hand (military organization)|The White Hand]] steadily gained control of the young and ambitious Prince Alexander. In what became Yugoslavia after the war, the White Hand grew into an essential piece of the state's machinery. It continued the imperialistic work of the Black Hand, using the same techniques. The death of Vojislav Petrovic, an ex-attache to the Yugoslav Legation in London, was said to be the work of Narodna Odbrana. Petrovic was preparing a book on the history of the Sarajevo assassinations and the Black Hand.

=== Balkan Wars ===

In 1912, differences between the two main groups of the Narodna Odbrana—political leaders of the Radical Party and military officers—arose. The political leaders preferred a more passive approach for the time being, including more peaceful relations with Austria and concentrating on strengthening Serbia for future struggle, but some of the military officers grew impatient with the more moderate radical policies. Consequently, the more zealous members of the Narodna Odbrana started a new secret society, and the Black Hand was founded.

Reportedly, they were involved in various crimes in [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], during the [[Balkan Wars]]:

{{quotation|At [[Uskub]], a central committee of &quot;[[Narodna Odbrana|national defense]]&quot;, with branches in other Macedonian towns, was formed side by side with the higher command, upon the arrival of the troops. The population of Uskub called their station behind the house of Weiss, near the Russian consulate, &quot;the black house,&quot; from the name of the league itself, &quot;the black hand.&quot; The worst crimes were committed by this secret organization, known to all the world and under powerful protection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archive.org/details/reportofinternat00inteuoft Report of the International Commission to Inquire into the Causes and Conduct of the Balkan Wars] (pp. 169)&lt;/ref&gt;|[[Report of the International Commission on the Balkan Wars]]}}

=== World War I ===
[[File:Apis.JPG|thumb|300px|[[Dragutin Dimitrijević]] &quot;Apis&quot; (right) and his associates.]]
Just prior to World War I, under the orders of the Chief of Serbian Military Intelligence, Serbian Military Officers and remnants of the by then moribund Black Hand organized and facilitated the assassination of Franz Ferdinand, Archduke of Austria on occasion of his visit to Sarajevo, Bosnia. The Austro-Hungarian investigation of the assassination rounded up all but one of the assassins and also much of the underground railroad that had been used to transport the assassins and their weapons from Serbia to Sarajevo. Within two days following the assassination, Austria-Hungary and Germany advised Serbia that she should open an investigation, but Serbian Foreign Minister Gruic, speaking for Serbia replied, &quot;Nothing had been done so far, and the matter did not concern the Serbian Government,&quot; after which &quot;high words&quot; were spoken on both sides. Entreaties by Germany asking Russia to intercede with Serbia were ignored. On July 23 Austria-Hungary delivered a toughly worded letter to Serbia with ten enumerated demands and additional demands in the preamble aimed at the destruction of the anti-Austrian terrorist and propaganda network in Serbia. Austria called attention to Serbia's March 1909 declaration committing to the Great Powers to respect Austria-Hungary's sovereignty over Bosnia-Herzegovina and committing Serbia to maintain good neighborly relations with Austria-Hungary. If the ten enumerated demands and demands in the preamble were not agreed to within 48 hours, Austria-Hungary would recall its ambassador from Serbia. The letter became known as the July Ultimatum. Serbia accepted all but one of the demands, to let the Austrian officers conduct an investigation on Serbian soil, which would have compromised its sovereignty. In response, Austria-Hungary recalled its ambassador.

Austria-Hungary authorized the mobilization and the declaration of war against Serbia on July 29, 1914. [[Franco-Russian Alliance|The Secret Treaty of 1892]] required both Russia and France to mobilize immediately followed by a commencement of action against the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]] if any member of the Triplice mobilized, and so, soon all the Great Powers of Europe were at war except Italy. Italy cited a clause in the Triple Alliance treaty which only bound it to enter in case of aggression against one of the treaty members, and so remained neutral - for the time being.

The six assassins caught by Austria-Hungary were tried and convicted for treason. The leader, [[Danilo Ilić]], was [[Hanging|hanged]]. The remaining assassins in custody were not yet twenty years old at the time of the assassination and so were given prison terms. Most of the underground railroad that transported them were also arrested, tried, and convicted. Two of these were executed. A few peripheral conspirators were acquitted. A wide ranging investigation rolled up many additional [[irredentist]] youths, and the fifth column that the Black Hand and Serbian Military Intelligence had tried to organize was eliminated. After receiving the Austrian letter, Serbia arrested Major [[Vojislav Tankosić|Voja Tankosić]] (a member of the Black Hand committee who had been pointed out by the assassins) but then promptly released him and returned him to his unit. The seventh assassin escaped to [[Montenegro]] where he was arrested. Austria-Hungary asserted its right to extradite him, but Montenegrin authorities instead allowed the assassin to &quot;escape&quot; to Serbia where he joined Major Tankosić's unit; Major Tankosić died in November 1915 covering the Serbian retreat, but not before confessing his role in the assassination to historians at Azania. Masterspy [[Rade Malobabić]], Serbian Military Intelligence's top agent against Austria-Hungary, was arrested on his return from Austria-Hungary after the assassination, but was also later released and given a commission running an army supply store. In 1917 Serbia's government in exile arrested the leadership of the Black Hand wishing to halt their underground influence in both the army and politics. The leadership was tried before a [[kangaroo court]] and convicted on false charges unrelated to Sarajevo, such as plotting an assassinations of [[Nikola Pašić]] and Crown prince Aleksandar; many were given death sentences. Three of the accused were ultimately shot by firing squad, against protests of the new [[Alexander Kerensky|Kerensky]] government of Russia. Before being shot, Dragutin Dimitrijević made a written confession to the court that he had ordered Rade Malobabić to organize the assassination of Franz Ferdinand. Malobabić made an implied confession to a priest before he was executed. Vulović's confession came at trial where he said he received orders signed by Serbia's top military officer to send Malobabic into Austria-Hungary just before the assassination. Much later, a new trial was ordered by Yugoslavia and the convictions were overturned.

== Ideology ==
The group encompassed a range of ideological outlooks, from conspiratorially-minded army officers to idealistic youths, sometimes tending towards republicanism, despite the acquisition of nationalistic royal circles in its activities (the movement's leader, Col. [[Dragutin Dimitrijević]] or &quot;Apis,&quot; had been instrumental in the [[May Overthrow|June 1903 coup]] which had brought King [[Peter I of Serbia|Petar Karađorđević]] to the [[List of Serbian monarchs|Serbian throne]] following 45 years of rule by the rival [[Obrenovic|Obrenović]] dynasty). The group was denounced as [[nihilism|nihilist]] by the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] press and compared to the Russian [[People's Will]] and the Chinese Assassination Corps which, like the Black Hand, used assassination to achieve anti-imperialist political goals.

A '''board of directors''' is a body of elected or appointed members who jointly oversee the activities of a [[company (law)|company]] or [[organization]]. The body sometimes has a different name, such as '''[[board of governors]]''', '''board of managers''', '''[[board of regents]]''', '''board of trustees''', '''board of visitors''', or '''executive board'''. It is often simply referred to as &quot;the board.&quot;

A board's activities are determined by the powers, duties, and responsibilities delegated to it or conferred on it by an authority outside itself. These matters are typically detailed in the organization's [[bylaws]]. The bylaws commonly also specify the number of members of the board, how they are to be chosen, and when they are to meet. 

In an organization with voting members, ''e.g.'', a professional society, the board acts on behalf of, and is subordinate to, the organization's full assembly, which usually chooses the members of the board. In a stock corporation, the board is elected by the stockholders and is the highest authority in the management of the corporation. In a [[non-stock corporation]] with no general voting membership, ''e.g.'', a university, the board is the supreme governing body of the institution;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Robert III | first = Henry M. | authorlink = | coauthors = William J.

Typical duties of boards of directors include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.managementhelp.org/boards/brdrspon.htm |title=Overview of Roles and Responsibilities of Corporate Board of Directors |accessdate=2008-01-26 |last=McNamara |first=Carter |work=Free Management Library |publisher=Authenticity Consulting, LLC }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iog.ca/boardgovernance/html/gov_the.html |title=Basic Role of the Board |accessdate=2008-01-27 |work=Governance Basics |publisher=Institute on Governance (Canada) |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071230201729/http://www.iog.ca/boardgovernance/html/gov_the.html |archivedate = 2007-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* governing the organization by establishing broad policies and objectives;
* selecting, appointing, supporting and reviewing the performance of the [[chief executive]];
* ensuring the availability of adequate financial resources;
* approving annual budgets;
* accounting to the stakeholders for the organization's performance.
* setting their own salaries and compensation

The legal responsibilities of boards and board members vary with the nature of the organization, and with the jurisdiction within which it operates. For public corporations, these responsibilities are typically much more rigorous and complex than for those of other types. 

Typically the board chooses one of its members to be the ''[[chairman]]'', who holds whatever title is specified in the bylaws.

==Directors==
The '''directors''' of an organization are the persons who are members of its board. Several specific terms categorize directors by the presence or absence of their other relationships to the organization.&lt;ref&gt;This section was developed from numerous definitions in [http://definitions.uslegal.com/i/inside-director/ USLegal.com], [http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/executive-director.html BusinessDictionary.com], [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/executive+director Dictionary.com],              [http://financial-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Inside+Director The Free Dictionary by Farlex], [http://www.thefreedictionary.com/executive+director ibid.], [http://financial-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/outside+director ibid.], [http://www.thefreedictionary.com/nonexecutive+director ibid.], [http://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/british/executive-director Macmillan Dictionary], and  [http://www.economics-dictionary.com/definition/non-executive-director.html Economics-dictionary.com].&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''inside director''' is a director who is also an employee, officer, major [[shareholder]], or someone similarly connected to the organization. Inside directors represent the interests of the entity's [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]], and often have special knowledge of its inner workings, its financial or market position, and so on. Directors with specified duties are only responsible for their own duties.

Typical inside directors are:
* A [[CEO]] who is also [[Chairman|Chairman of the Board]]
* Other executives of the organization, such as its [[Chief Financial Officer]] or [[Executive Vice President]]
* Large shareholders (who may or may not also be employees or officers)
* Representatives of other stakeholders such as labor unions, major lenders, or members of the community in which the organization is located

An inside director who is employed as a manager or executive of the organization is sometimes referred to as an '''executive director''' (not to be confused with the title [[executive director]] sometimes used for the CEO position). Executive directors often have a specified area of responsibility in the organization, such as finance, marketing, human resources, or production. 

An '''outside director''' or '''non-executive director''' is a member of the board who is not otherwise employed by or engaged with the organization, and does not represent any of its stakeholders. A typical example is a director who is president of a firm in a different industry. 

Outside directors bring outside experience and perspective to the board. They keep a watchful eye on the inside directors and on the way the organization is run. Outside directors are often useful in handling disputes between inside directors, or between shareholders and the board. They are thought to be advantageous because they can be objective and present little risk of conflict of interest. On the other hand, they might lack familiarity with the specific issues connected to the organization's governance.

Recapping the terminology:
*'''director''' - any member of the board of directors
*'''inside director''' - a director with a meaningful connection to the organization, other than serving on the board
*'''outside director''' - a director with no connections to the organization except for serving on the board
*'''executive director''' - an inside director who is also an executive with the organization. The term is also used, in a completely different sense, to refer to a CEO
*'''non-executive director''' - a director who is not an executive with the organization

Individual directors often serve on more than one board. This practice results in an [[interlocking directorate]], where a relatively small number of individuals have significant influence over a large number of important entities. This situation can have important corporate, social, economic, and legal consequences, and has been the subject of significant research.

===Sarbanes-Oxley Act===

The [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act]] (SOX) has introduced new standards of accountability on boards of U.S. companies or companies listed on U.S. [[stock exchange]]s. Under the Act, directors risk large fines and prison sentences in the case of accounting crimes. [[Internal control]] is now the direct responsibility of directors. The vast majority of companies covered by the Act have hired internal auditors to ensure that the company adheres to the highest standards of internal control. The internal auditors are required by law to report directly to an audit board, consisting of directors more than half of whom are outside directors, one of whom is an accounting expert.

==Corporations==
Theoretically, the control of a company is divided between two bodies: the board of directors, and the [[stockholder|shareholders]] in [[general meeting]]. In practice, the amount of power exercised by the board varies with the type of company. In small private companies, the directors and the shareholders are normally the same people, and thus there is no real division of power. In large [[public company|public companies]], the board tends to exercise more of a supervisory role, and individual responsibility and management tends to be delegated downward to individual professional executives (such as a finance director or a marketing director) who deal with particular areas of the company's affairs.

Another feature of boards of directors in large public companies is that the board tends to have more ''[[de facto]]'' power. The board can comprise a voting bloc that is difficult to overcome, because of the practice where institutional shareholders (such as pension funds and banks) grant proxies to the board to vote their shares at general meetings, and because a large number of shareholders are involved. However, there have been moves recently to try to increase [[shareholder activism]] among both institutional investors and individuals with small shareholdings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.economist.com/business/displaystory.cfm?story_id=E1_VGDTSQT | work=The Economist | title=Battling for corporate America | date=2006-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.economist.com/finance/displaystory.cfm?story_id=E1_VTTRRQV | work=The Economist | title=Shareholder power | date=2005-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A [[board-only]] organization is one whose board is self-appointed, rather than being accountable to a base of members through elections; or in which the powers of the membership are extremely limited.

In most cases, serving on a board is not a [[career]] unto itself, but board members often receive remunerations amounting to hundreds of thousands of dollars per year since they often sit on the boards of several companies.&lt;ref name=&quot;About.com&quot;&gt;[http://beginnersinvest.about.com/cs/a/aa2203a_2.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; Inside directors are usually not paid for sitting on a board, but the duty is instead considered part of their larger job description. Outside directors are usually paid for their services.&lt;ref name=&quot;About.com&quot;/&gt; These remunerations vary between corporations, but usually consist of a yearly or monthly salary, additional compensation for each meeting attended, stock options, and various other benefits. [[Tiffany &amp; Co.]], for example, pays directors an annual retainer of $46,500, an additional annual retainer of $2,500 if the director is also a chairperson of a committee, a per-meeting-attended fee of $2,000 for meetings attended in person, a $500 fee for each meeting attended via telephone, in addition to stock options and retirement benefits.&lt;ref name=&quot;About.com&quot;/&gt;

==Classification==
The role and responsibilities of a board of directors vary depending on the nature and type of business entity and the laws applying to the entity (see [[types of business entity]]). For example, the nature of the business entity may be one that is traded on a public market (public company), not traded on a public market (a private, limited or closely held company), owned by family members (a family business), or exempt from income taxes (a non-profit, not for profit, or tax-exempt entity). There are numerous types of business entities available throughout the world such as a corporation, limited liability company, cooperative, business trust, partnership, private limited company, and public limited company.

Much of what has been written about boards of directors relates to boards of directors of business entities actively traded on public markets.&lt;ref&gt;See generally, Bowen, William G., The board book: an insider's guide for directors and trustees (2008 W.W. Norton &amp; Co.); Murray, Alan S., Revolt in the boardroom: the new rules of power in corporate America (2007 Collins); Charan, Ram, Boards that deliver: advancing corporate governance from compliance to competitive advantage (2005 Jossey-Bass); Carver, John, Corporate boards that create value: governing company performance from the boardroom (2002 Jossey-Bass); Harvard business review on corporate governance (2000 Harvard Business School Press).&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, however, material is becoming available for boards of private and closely held businesses including family businesses.&lt;ref&gt;See specifically Tutelman and Hause, The Balance Point: New Ways Business Owners Can Use Boards (2008 Famille Press).&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The development of a separate board of directors to manage the company has occurred incrementally and indefinitely over legal history. Until the end of the 19th century, it seems to have been generally assumed that the general meeting (of all shareholders) was the supreme organ of the company, and the board of directors was merely an agent of the company subject to the control of the shareholders in general meeting.&lt;ref&gt;Gower, ''Principles of Company Law'' (6th ed.), citing ''[[Isle of Wight Railway v Tahourdin]]'' (1883) 25 Ch D 320.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, by 1906, the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|English Court of Appeal]] had made it clear in the decision of ''[[Automatic Self-Cleansing Filter Syndicate Co v Cunningham]]'' [1906] 2 Ch 34 that the division of powers between the board and the shareholders in general meaning depended on the construction of the [[Articles of Association (law)|articles of association]] and that, where the powers of management were vested in the board, the general meeting could not interfere with their lawful exercise. The articles were held to constitute a contract by which the members had agreed that &quot;the directors and the directors alone shall manage.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Per'' Cozens-Hardy LJ at 44&lt;/ref&gt;

The new approach did not secure immediate approval, but it was endorsed by the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] in ''[[Quin &amp; Axtens v Salmon]]'' [1909] AC 442 and has since received general acceptance. Under English law, successive versions of [[Table A]] have reinforced the norm that, unless the directors are acting contrary to the law or the provisions of the Articles, the powers of conducting the management and affairs of the company are vested in them.

The modern doctrine was expressed in ''[[Shaw &amp; Sons (Salford) Ltd v Shaw]]'' [1935] 2 KB 113 by Greer LJ as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;A company is an entity distinct alike from its shareholders and its directors. Some of its powers may, according to its articles, be exercised by directors, certain other powers may be reserved for the shareholders in general meeting. If powers of management are vested in the directors, they and they alone can exercise these powers. The only way in which the general body of shareholders can control the exercise of powers by the articles in the directors is by altering the articles, or, if opportunity arises under the articles, by refusing to re-elect the directors of whose actions they disapprove. They cannot themselves usurp the powers which by the articles are vested in the directors any more than the directors can usurp the powers vested by the articles in the general body of shareholders.&quot;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It has been remarked that this development in the law was somewhat surprising at the time, as the relevant provisions in [[Table A]] (as it was then) seemed to contradict this approach rather than to endorse it.&lt;ref&gt;See Gower, ''Principles of Company Law'' (6th ed.) at 185.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Election and removal==

In &quot;most&quot; legal systems, the appointment and removal of directors is voted upon by the shareholders in general meeting&lt;ref&gt;For example, in the United Kingdom, see section 303 of the Companies Act 1985&lt;/ref&gt; or through a [[proxy statement]]. For publicly-traded companies in the U.S., the directors which are available to vote on are largely selected by either the board as a whole or a [[nominating committee]].&lt;ref name=Shivdasani1999/&gt; Although in 2002 the NYSE and the NASDAQ required that nominating committees consist of independent directors as a condition of listing,&lt;ref&gt;Chhaochharia V, Grinstein Y. (2007). [http://faculty.fullerton.edu/jyang/Courses/fin332/Literature/governance%20rule%20result.pdf Corporate governance and firm value: The impact of the 2002 governance rules]. ''The Journal of Finance''.&lt;/ref&gt; nomination committees have historically received input from management in their selections even when the CEO does not have a position on the board.&lt;ref name=Shivdasani1999/&gt; Shareholder nominations can only occur at the general meeting itself or through the prohibitively expensive process of mailing out ballots separately; in May 2009 the SEC proposed a new rule allowing shareholders meeting certain criteria to add nominees to the proxy statement.&lt;ref&gt;SEC. (May 2009). [http://www.sec.gov/news/press/2009/2009-116.htm SEC Votes to Propose Rule Amendments to Facilitate Rights of Shareholders to Nominate Directors].&lt;/ref&gt; In practice for publicly-traded companies, the managers ([[inside director]]s) who are purportedly accountable to the board of directors have historically played a major role in selecting and nominating the directors who are voted on by the shareholders, in which case more &quot;gray outsider directors&quot; (independent directors with conflicts of interest) are nominated and elected.&lt;ref name=Shivdasani1999&gt;Shivdasani A, Yermack D. (1999). [http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~eofek/PhD/papers/SY_CEO_JF.pdf CEO involvement in the selection of new board members: An empirical analysis]. ''Journal of Finance''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Directors may also leave office by resignation or death. In some legal systems, directors may also be removed by a resolution of the remaining directors (in some countries they may only do so &quot;with cause&quot;; in others the power is unrestricted).

Some jurisdictions also permit the board of directors to appoint directors, either to fill a vacancy which arises on resignation or death, or as an addition to the existing directors.

In practice, it can be quite difficult to remove a director by a resolution in general meeting. In many legal systems, the director has a right to receive special notice of any resolution to remove him or her;&lt;ref&gt;In the United Kingdom it is 28 days' notice, see sections 303(2) and 379 of the Companies Act 1985&lt;/ref&gt; the company must often supply a copy of the proposal to the director, who is usually entitled to be heard by the meeting.&lt;ref&gt;In the United Kingdom, see section 304(1) of the Companies Act 1985. A private company cannot use a written resolution under section 381A – a meeting must be held.&lt;/ref&gt; The director may require the company to circulate any representations that he wishes to make.&lt;ref&gt;In the United Kingdom, see sections 303(2) and (3) of the Companies Act 1985&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the director's contract of service will usually entitle him to compensation if he is removed, and may often include a generous &quot;[[golden parachute]]&quot; which also acts as a deterrent to removal.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

In a recent academic study that was published in the ''Journal of Finance'', [[Drexel University]]’s LeBow College of Business professors Jie Cai, Jacqueline Garner, and Ralph Walkling examined how corporate shareholders voted in nearly 2,500 director elections in the United States. They found that directors received fewer votes from shareholders when their companies performed poorly, had excess CEO compensation, or had poor shareholder protection. They also found that directors received fewer votes when they did not regularly attend board meetings or received negative recommendations from RiskMetrics (a proxy advisory firm). This evidence suggests that some shareholders express their displeasure with a company by voting against its directors. The article also shows that companies often improve their corporate governance by removing [[poison pill]]s or classified boards and by reducing excessive CEO pay after their directors receive low shareholder support.&lt;ref&gt;Cai, J., J. L. Garner, and R. A. Walkling, 2009. ''Electing Directors''. ''Journal of Finance'' 64 (5), 2387–2419.&lt;/ref&gt;

Board accountability to shareholders is a recurring issue. In 2010, the ''New York Times'' noted that several directors who had overseen companies which had failed in the [[financial crisis of 2007–2010]] had found new positions as directors.&lt;ref&gt;Craig S, Lattman P. (2010). [http://dealbook.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/14/companies-may-fail-but-directors-are-in-demand/?src=me&amp;ref=business Companies May Fail, but Directors Are in Demand]. ''New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exercise of powers==

The exercise by the board of directors of its powers usually occurs in board meetings. Most legal systems require sufficient notice to be given to all directors of these meetings, and that a [[quorum]] must be present before any business may be conducted. Usually, a meeting which is held without notice having been given is still valid if all of the directors attend, but it has been held that a failure to give notice may negate resolutions passed at a meeting, because the persuasive oratory of a minority of directors might have persuaded the majority to change their minds and vote otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;See for example ''[[Barber's Case]]'' (1877) 5 Ch D 963 and ''[[Re Portuguese Consolidated Copper Mines]]'' (1889) 42 Ch D 160&lt;/ref&gt;

In most [[common law]] countries, the powers of the board are vested in the board as a whole, and not in the individual directors.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Breckland Group Holdings Ltd v London and Suffolk Properties]]'' [1989] BCLC 100&lt;/ref&gt; However, in instances an individual director may still bind the company by his acts by virtue of his [[ostensible authority]] (see also: [[Royal British Bank v Turquand|the rule in ''Turquand's Case'']]).

==Duties==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Corporate benefit]]. See [[WP:MOS#Section management]] --&gt;
{{main|Directors' duties|Fiduciary duties}}

Because directors exercise control and management over the organization, but organizations are (in theory) run for the benefit of the [[stockholder|shareholders]], the law imposes strict duties on directors in relation to the exercise of their duties. The duties imposed on directors are [[fiduciary]] duties, similar to those that the law imposes on those in similar positions of trust: [[agency (law)|agents]] and [[trustee]]s.

The duties apply to each director separately, while the powers apply to the board jointly. Also, the duties are owed to the company itself, and not to any other entity.&lt;ref&gt;''Percival v Wright'' [1902] Ch 421&lt;/ref&gt; This does not mean that directors can never stand in a fiduciary relationship to the individual shareholders; they may well have such a duty in certain circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;For example, if the board is authorised by the shareholders to negotiate with a takeover bidder. It has been held in New Zealand that &quot;depending upon all the surround circumstances and the nature of the responsibility which in a real and practical sense the director has assumed towards the shareholder,&quot; ''Coleman v Myers'' [1977] 2 NZLR 225&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acting ''bona fide''===

Directors must act honestly and ''bona fide'' (&quot;in [[good faith]]&quot;). The test is a subjective one, and directors must act in what they consider is in the interests of the company, not what a court might consider to be those interests.&lt;ref&gt;''Re Smith &amp; Fawcett Ltd'' [1942] Ch 304&lt;/ref&gt; However, the directors may still be held to have failed in this duty where they fail to direct their minds to the question of whether a transaction was in the best interests of the company.&lt;ref&gt;''Re W &amp; M Roith Ltd'' [1967] 1 WLR 432&lt;/ref&gt;

Difficult questions can arise when treating the company too much in the abstract. For example, it may be for the benefit of a corporate group as a whole for a company to guarantee the debts of a &quot;sister&quot; company,&lt;ref&gt;That is a company which has the same 100% shareholder&lt;/ref&gt; even though there is no ostensible &quot;benefit&quot; to the company giving the guarantee. Similarly, conceptually at least, there is no benefit to a company in returning profits to shareholders by way of [[dividend]]. However, the more pragmatic approach illustrated in the Australian case of ''Mills v Mills'' (1938) 60 CLR 150 normally prevails:

:&quot;[directors are] not required by the law to live in an unreal region of detached altruism and to act in the vague mood of ideal abstraction from obvious facts which must be present to the mind of any honest and intelligent man when he exercises his powers as a director.&quot;

===&quot;Proper purpose&quot;===

Directors must exercise their powers for a proper purpose. While in many instances an improper purpose is readily evident, such as a director looking to feather his or her own nest or divert an investment opportunity to a relative, such breaches usually involve a breach of the director's duty to act in good faith. Greater difficulties arise where the director, while acting in good faith, is serving a purpose that is not regarded by the law as proper.

The seminal authority in relation to what amounts to a proper purpose is the [[Judicial committee of the Privy Council|Privy Council]] decision of ''Howard Smith Ltd v Ampol Ltd'' [1974] AC 821. The case concerned the power of the directors to issue new [[stock|shares]].&lt;ref&gt;Following ''[[Hogg v. Cramphorn Ltd.]]'' [1967] Ch 254&lt;/ref&gt; It was alleged that the directors had issued a large number of new shares purely to deprive a particular shareholder of his voting majority. An argument that the power to issue shares could only be properly exercised to raise new capital was rejected as too narrow, and it was held that it would be a proper exercise of the director's powers to issue shares to a larger company to ensure the financial stability of the company, or as part of an agreement to exploit mineral rights owned by the company.&lt;ref&gt;''Teck Corporation v Millar'' (1972) 33 DLR (3d) 288&lt;/ref&gt; If so, the mere fact that an incidental result (even if it was a desired consequence) was that a shareholder lost his majority, or a takeover bid was defeated, this would not itself make the share issue improper. But if the sole purpose was to destroy a voting majority, or block a takeover bid, that would be an improper purpose.

Not all jurisdictions recognised the &quot;proper purpose&quot; duty as separate from the &quot;good faith&quot; duty however.&lt;ref&gt;This division was rejected in British Columbia in ''Teck Corporation v Millar'' (1972) 33 DLR (3d) 288&lt;/ref&gt;

===&quot;Unfettered discretion&quot;===

Directors cannot, without the consent of the company, fetter their [[discretion]] in relation to the exercise of their powers, and cannot bind themselves to vote in a particular way at future board meetings.&lt;ref&gt;Although as Gower points out, as well understood as the rule is, there is a paucity of authority on the point. But see ''Clark v Workman'' [1920] 1 Ir R 107 and ''Dawson International plc v Coats Paton plc'' 1989 SLT 655&lt;/ref&gt; This is so even if there is no improper motive or purpose, and no personal advantage to the director .

This does not mean, however, that the board cannot agree to the company entering into a contract which binds the company to a certain course, even if certain actions in that course will require further board approval. The company remains bound, but the directors retain the discretion to vote against taking the future actions (although that may involve a breach by the company of the [[contract]] that the board previously approved).

===&quot;Conflict of duty and interest&quot;===

As fiduciaries, the directors may not put themselves in a position where their interests and duties conflict with the duties that they owe to the company. The law takes the view that good faith must not only be done, but must be manifestly seen to be done, and zealously patrols the conduct of directors in this regard; and will not allow directors to escape liability by asserting that his decision was in fact well founded. Traditionally, the law has divided conflicts of duty and interest into three sub-categories.

====Transactions with the company====

By definition, where a director enters into a transaction with a company, there is a conflict between the director's interest (to do well for himself out of the transaction) and his duty to the company (to ensure that the company gets as much as it can out of the transaction). This rule is so strictly enforced that, even where the [[conflict of interest]] or conflict of duty is purely hypothetical, the directors can be forced to disgorge all personal gains arising from it. In ''Aberdeen Ry v Blaikie'' (1854) 1 Macq HL 461 [[Robert Rolfe, 1st Baron Cranworth|Lord Cranworth]] stated in his judgment that:

:&quot;A corporate body can only act by agents, and it is, of course, the duty of those agents so to act as best to promote the interests of the corporation whose affairs they are conducting. Such agents have duties to discharge of a fiduciary nature towards their principal. And it is a rule of universal application that no one, having such duties to discharge, shall be allowed to enter into engagements in which he has, ''or can have'', a personal interest conflicting ''or which possibly may conflict'', with the interests of those whom he is bound to protect... So strictly is this principle adhered to that no question is allowed to be raised as to the fairness or unfairness of the contract entered into...&quot; (''emphasis'' added)

However, in many jurisdictions the members of the company are permitted to ratify transactions which would otherwise fall foul of this principle. It is also largely accepted in most jurisdictions that this principle can be overridden in the company's constitution.

In many countries, there is also a statutory duty to declare interests in relation to any transactions, and the director can be fined for failing to make disclosure.&lt;ref&gt;In the United Kingdom, see section 317 of the Companies Act 1985&lt;/ref&gt;

====Use of corporate property, opportunity, or information====
Directors must not, without the informed consent of the company, use for their own profit the company's assets, [[corporate opportunity|opportunities]], or information. This prohibition is much less flexible than the prohibition against the transactions with the company, and attempts to circumvent it using provisions in the articles have met with limited success.

In ''[[Regal (Hastings) v Gulliver|Regal (Hastings) Ltd v Gulliver]]'' [1942] All ER 378 the House of Lords, in upholding what was regarded as a wholly unmeritorious claim by the shareholders,&lt;ref&gt;In summary, the facts were as follows: Company A owned a cinema, and the directors decided to acquire two other cinemas with a view to selling the entire undertaking as a [[going concern]]. They formed a new company (&quot;Company B&quot;) to take the leases of the two new cinemas. But the lessor insisted on various stipulations, one of which was that Company B had to have a paid up [[share capital]] of not less than £5,000 (a substantial sum at the time). Company A was unable to subscribe for more than £2,000 in shares, so the directors arranged for the remaining 3,000 shares to be taken by themselves and their friends. Later, instead of selling the undertaking, they sold all of the shares in both companies and made a substantial profit. The shareholders of Company A sued asking that directors and their friends to disgorge the profits that they had made in connection with their 3,000 shares in Company B – the very same shares which the shareholders in Company A had been asked to subscribe (through Company A) but refused to do so.&lt;/ref&gt; held that:

:&quot;(i) that what the directors did was so related to the affairs of the company that it can properly be said to have been done in the course of their management and in the utilisation of their opportunities and special knowledge as directors; and (ii) that what they did resulted in profit to themselves.&quot;

And accordingly, the directors were required to disgorge the profits that they made, and the shareholders received their windfall.

The decision has been followed in several subsequent cases,&lt;ref&gt;''Industrial Development Consultants v Cooley'' [1972] 1 WLR 443 (corporate information), ''[[Canadian Aero Service v. O'Malley]]'' (1973) 40 DLR (3d) 371 (corporate opportunity) and ''Boardman v Phipps'' [1967] 2 AC 46 (corporate opportunity, which again, the company itself had declined to take up)&lt;/ref&gt; and is now regarded as settled law.

====Competing with the company====
Directors cannot compete directly with the company without a conflict of interest arising. Similarly, they should not act as directors of competing companies, as their duties to each company would then conflict with each other.

===Common law duties of care and skill===
Traditionally, the level of care and skill which has to be demonstrated by a director has been framed largely with reference to the non-executive director. In ''[[Re City Equitable Fire Insurance Co]]'' [1925] Ch 407, it was expressed in purely subjective terms, where the court held that:

:&quot;a director need not exhibit in the performance of his duties a greater degree of skill than may reasonably be expected from a person of ''his'' knowledge and experience.&quot; (''emphasis'' added)

However, this decision was based firmly in the older notions (see above) that prevailed at the time as to the mode of corporate decision making, and effective control residing in the shareholders; if they elected and put up with an incompetent decision maker, they should not have recourse to complain.

However, a more modern approach has since developed, and in ''[[Dorchester Finance Co Ltd v Stebbing]]'' [1989] BCLC 498 the court held that the rule in ''Equitable Fire'' related only to skill, and not to diligence. With respect to diligence, what was required was:

:&quot;such care as an ordinary man might be expected to take on his own behalf.&quot;

This was a dual subjective and objective test, and one deliberately pitched at a higher level.

More recently, it has been suggested that both the tests of skill and diligence should be assessed objectively and subjectively; in the United Kingdom, the statutory provisions relating to directors' duties in the new [[Companies Act 2006]] have been codified on this basis.&lt;ref name=&quot;NormanGoddard&quot;&gt;''Norman v [[Theodore Goddard]]'' [1991] BCLC 1027&lt;/ref&gt;

===Remedies for breach of duty===

In most jurisdictions, the law provides for a variety of remedies in the event of a breach by the directors of their duties:
# [[injunction]] or [[declaration (law)|declaration]]
# [[damages]] or compensation
# restoration of the company's property
# [[rescission]] of the relevant [[contract]]
# [[account of profits]]
# [[Termination of employment#Summary termination|summary dismissal]]

===The future===

Historically, directors' duties have been owed almost exclusively to the company and its members, and the board was expected to exercise its powers for the [[corporate benefit|financial benefit]] of the company. However, more recently there have been attempts to &quot;soften&quot; the position, and provide for more scope for directors to act as good corporate citizens. For example, in the United Kingdom, the [[Companies Act 2006]] requires directors of companies &quot;to promote the success of the company for the benefit of its members as a whole&quot;, but sets out six factors to which a director must have regards in fulfilling the duty to promote success. These are:
* the likely consequences of any decision in the long term
* the interests of the company’s employees
* the need to foster the company’s business relationships with suppliers, customers and others
* the impact of the company’s operations on the community and the environment
* the desirability of the company maintaining a reputation for high standards of business conduct, and
* the need to act fairly as between members of a company

This represents a considerable departure from the traditional notion that directors' duties are owed only to the company. Previously in the United Kingdom, under the [[Companies Act 1985]], protections for non-member stakeholders were considerably more limited (see for example, s.309 which permitted directors to take into account the interests of employees but which could only be enforced by the shareholders and not by the employees themselves). The changes have therefore been the subject of some criticism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.altassets.net/features/arc/2006/nz8451.php Director's duties]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Failures ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2010}}
While the primary responsibility of boards is to ensure that the corporation's management is performing its job correctly, actually achieving this in practice can be difficult. In a number of &quot;corporate scandals&quot; of the 1990s, one notable feature revealed in subsequent investigations is that boards were not aware of the activities of the managers that they hired, and the true financial state of the corporation. A number of factors may be involved in this tendency:

* Most boards largely rely on management to report information to them, thus allowing management to place the desired 'spin' on information, or even conceal or lie about the true state of a company.
* Boards of directors are part-time bodies, whose members meet only occasionally and may not know each other particularly well. This unfamiliarity can make it difficult for board members to question management.
* [[CEO]]s tend to be rather forceful personalities. In some cases, CEOs are accused of exercising too much influence over the company's board.
* Directors may not have the time or the skills required to understand the details of corporate business, allowing management to obscure problems.
* The same directors who appointed the present CEO oversee his or her performance. This makes it difficult for some directors to dispassionately evaluate the CEO's performance.
* Directors often feel that a judgment of a manager, particularly one who has performed well in the past, should be respected. This can be quite legitimate, but poses problems if the manager's judgment is indeed flawed.
* All of the above may contribute to a culture of &quot;not rocking the boat&quot; at board meetings.

Because of this, the role of boards in [[corporate governance]], and how to improve their oversight capability, has been examined carefully in recent years, and new legislation in a number of jurisdictions, and an increased focus on the topic by boards themselves, has seen changes implemented to try and improve their performance.

== Process ==

The process for running a board, sometimes called the [[board process]], includes the selection of board members, the setting of clear board objectives, the dissemination of documents or [[board package]] to the board members, the collaborative creation of an [[agenda]] for the meeting, the creation and follow-up of assigned [[action items]], and the assessment of the board process through standardized assessments of board members, owners, and CEOs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slideshare.net/nasscom/how-to-make-corporate-board-more-effective-prof-krishna-g-palepuharvard-business-school Board Process]&lt;/ref&gt; The science of this process has been slow to develop due to the secretive nature of the way most companies run their boards, however some standardization is beginning to develop. Some who are pushing for this standardization are the [[National Association of Corporate Directors]], [[McKinsey]] Consulting and [[The Board Group]].

{{Campaignbox First Balkan War}}
{{Campaignbox Second Balkan War}}

The '''Balkan Wars''' were two conflicts that took place in the [[Balkans]] in south-eastern [[Europe]] in 1912 and 1913. 

The [[First Balkan War]] broke out on 8 October 1912 when [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], [[Kingdom of Greece|Greece]], [[Kingdom of Montenegro|Montenegro]] and [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]] (see [[Balkan League]]), having large parts of their ethnic populations under Ottoman sovereignty, attacked the [[Ottoman Empire]], terminating its five-century rule in the [[Balkans]] in a seven-month campaign resulting in the [[Treaty of London, 1913|Treaty of London]].

The [[Second Balkan War]] broke out on 16 June 1913 when Bulgaria was dissatisfied over the division of the spoils in [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], made in secret by its former allies, Serbia and [[Greece]]. Their armies repulsed the Bulgarian offensive and counter-attacked penetrating into Bulgaria, while [[Romania]] and the Ottoman Empire took the opportunity to intervene against Bulgaria and make territorial gains. In the resulting [[Treaty of Bucharest (1913)|Treaty of Bucharest]], Bulgaria lost most of the territories it had gained in the [[First Balkan War]].

==Background==
{{See also|Rise of nationalism under the Ottoman Empire}}
The background to the wars lies in the incomplete emergence of [[nation-states]] on the European territory of the Ottoman Empire during the second half of the 19th century. The [[Serbs]] had gained substantial territory during the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1877–1878]], while Greece acquired [[Thessaly]] in 1881 (although it lost a small area back to the Ottoman Empire in 1897) and Bulgaria (an autonomous [[principality]] since 1878) incorporated the formerly distinct province of [[Eastern Rumelia]] (1885). All three as well as Montenegro sought additional territories within the large Ottoman-ruled region known as [[Rumelia]], comprising Eastern Rumelia, [[Albania]], Macedonia, and [[Thrace]] (''see map'').

===Policies of the Great Powers===
Throughout the 19th century, the [[Great Power]]s shared different aims over the &quot;[[Eastern Question]]&quot; and the integrity of the Ottoman Empire. [[Russia]] wished for access to the &quot;warm waters&quot; of the [[Mediterranean]]; it pursued a [[Pan-Slavism|pan-Slavic]] foreign policy and thereby supported [[Bulgaria]] and [[Serbia]]. [[United Kingdom|Britain]] wished to deny Russia access to the &quot;warm waters&quot; and supported the integrity of the Ottoman Empire, although it also supported a limited expansion of Greece as a backup plan in case integrity of the empire was no longer possible. [[France]] wished to strengthen its position in the region, especially in the [[Levant]] (today's [[Lebanon]], [[Syria]], the [[Palestine|Palestinian territories]] and [[Israel]]).

The [[Habsburg]]-ruled [[Austria-Hungary]] wished for a continuation of the existence of the Ottoman Empire, since both were troubled multinational entities and thus the collapse of the one might weaken the other. The [[Habsburgs]] also saw a strong Ottoman presence in area as a counterweight to the Serbian [[nationalist]]ic call to their own Serb subjects in [[Bosnia]]. Regarding Italy, it has been argued that from that time it wished to recreate the [[Roman empire]]; its main aim at the time seems to have been primarily the denial of access to the [[Adriatic Sea]] of another major sea power. Germany in turn, under the &quot;[[Drang nach Osten]]&quot; policy, aspired to turn the Ottoman Empire into its own de-facto colony, and thus supported its integrity.

Bulgaria and Greece sent armed bandits inside the Empire (in Macedonia and Thrace) in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, to protect their own nationals from the forced &quot;Bulgarization&quot; of Greeks by Bulgarians or &quot;Hellinization&quot; of Bulgars by Greeks. Low intensity warfare had broken out inside Macedonia between the Greek and Bulgarian bands and the Ottoman army after 1904 in the [[Struggle for Macedonia]]. After the [[Young Turks|Young Turk revolution]] of July 1908, the situation changed drastically.

===The Young Turk revolution===
{{Main|Young Turk Revolution}}
It is no surprise that the &quot;Young Turk&quot; [[revolution]] occurred in the troubled European provinces of the Empire. There the threat to its integrity was the most pronounced, and the need for reforms was most evident. When the revolt broke out, it was supported by intellectuals, the army, and almost all the ethnic minorities of the Empire, and forced Sultan [[Abdul Hamid II]] to re-adopt the long defunct Ottoman constitution of 1877, ushering in the [[Second Constitutional Era (Ottoman Empire)|Second Constitutional Era]]. Hopes were raised among the Balkan ethnicities of reforms and autonomy, and elections were held to form a representative, multi-ethnic, Ottoman parliament. However, following the Sultan's [[Countercoup (1909)|attempted counter-coup]], the liberal element of the Young Turks was sidelined and the nationalist element became dominant.

At the same time, in October 1908, Austria-Hungary seized the opportunity of the Ottoman political upheaval to annex the ''de jure'' Ottoman province of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia-Herzegovina]], which it had occupied since 1878 (see ''[[Bosnian Crisis]]''), and Bulgaria declared itself a fully independent kingdom. The Greeks of the autonomous [[Cretan State]] proclaimed unification with Greece, though the opposition of the Great Powers prevented the latter action from taking practical influence.

===Reaction in the Balkan States===

Frustrated in the north by Austria-Hungary's incorporation of Bosnia with its 975,000 Orthodox [[Serbs]] (and many more Serbs and Serb-sympathizers of other faiths), and forced (March 1909) to accept the annexation and restrain anti-Habsburg agitation among Serbian nationalist groups, the Serbian government looked to formerly Serb territories in the south, notably &quot;Old Serbia&quot; (the [[Sanjak of Novi Pazar]] and the province of [[Kosovo]]).

On 15 August 1909 the [[Military League]], a group of Greek officers, took action against the government to reform their country's national government and reorganize the army. The league found itself unable to create a new political system, until the league summoned the Cretan politician [[Eleutherios Venizelos]] to Athens as its political adviser. Venizelos persuaded the king to revise the constitution and asked the league to disband in favor of a National Assembly. In March 1910 the Military League dissolved itself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9052680 &quot;Military League&quot;], Encyclopædia Britannica Online&lt;/ref&gt;

Bulgaria, which had secured Ottoman recognition of her independence in April 1909 and enjoyed the friendship of Russia,&lt;ref name=&quot;Congress&quot;&gt;{{cite web |year=2007 |url = http://countrystudies.us/bulgaria/12.htm|title = THE BALKAN WARS|publisher = [[US Library of Congress]]| accessdate = 2008-04-15 | last= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; also looked to districts of Ottoman [[Thrace]] and Macedonia. In August 1910 Montenegro followed Bulgaria's precedent by becoming a kingdom.

===The Balkan League===
[[Image:Bulgarian army adrinople.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Bulgarian forces waiting to commence their assault on [[Adrianople]]]]
{{Main|Balkan League}}
Following Italy's victory in the [[Italo-Turkish War]] of 1911-1912 the [[Young Turks]] fell from power after a coup. The Balkan countries saw this as an opportunity to attack and fulfill their desires of expansion.

With the initial encouragement of Russian agents, a series of agreements was concluded between Serbia and Bulgaria in March 1912. Military victory against the Ottoman empire would not be possible while it could bring reinforcements from Asia. The condition of the Ottoman railways of the time was primitive, so most reinforcement would have to come by sea through the Aegean. Greece was the only Balkan country with a navy powerful enough to deny use of the Aegean to the Ottomans, thus a treaty became necessary between Greece and Bulgaria which signed in May 1912.

Montenegro concluded agreements between Serbia and Bulgaria later that year. Bulgaria signed treaties with Serbia to divide between them the territory of northern [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], but such an agreement was clearly denied to Greece. Bulgaria's policy then was to use the agreement to limit Serbia's access to Macedonia, while at the same time denying any such agreement with Greece, believing that its army would be able to occupy the larger part of Aegean Macedonia and the important port city of Thessaloniki before the Greeks.

The resulting alliance between Greece, Serbia, Bulgaria, and Montenegro became known as the [[Balkan League]]; its existence was undesirable for all the Great Powers. The league was loose at best, though a secret liaison officer was exchanged between the Greek and the Serbian army after the war began. Greece delayed the start of the war several times in the summer of 1912, in order to better prepare her navy, but Montenegro declared war on 8 October (25 September [[Old Style and New Style dates|O.S.]]). Following an ultimatum to the Ottomans, the remaining members of the alliance entered the conflict on 17 October.

Despite their alliance, Greco-Bulgarian antagonism over the city and Macedonia in general did not abate.]]
With the exception of Greece, and in continuation of their secret prewar settlements of expansion between them and under close Russian supervision, the three Slavic allies (Bulgarian, Serbs and Montenegrins) had laid out extensive plans to coordinate their war efforts: the Serbs and Montenegrins in the theater of Sandjak, the Bulgarians and Serbs in the Macedonian and Thracian theaters. The Ottoman Empire had a massive pool of manpower of about 26 million people, but it was handicapped by an army heavily dependent on reinforcements that had to come mainly from the Asian part of the Empire where 3/4 of the population and the majority of the Muslims lived. These had to be transferred to the Balkans mostly by ship, but this depended on the result of battles between the Ottoman and Greek navies in the Aegean. With the outbreak of the war the Ottoman forces activated three Army HQs, allocating there most of their available forces per front: the Thracian with its HQ in Constantinople, the Western with its HQ in Salonika and the Vardar with its HQ in Skopje, against the Bulgarians, the Greeks and the Serbians respectively. Smaller independent units had been allocated elsewhere, mostly around heavily fortified cities.

Montenegro was the first that declared war on 8 October.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Its main thrust was towards [[Shkodra]], with secondary operations in the [[Novi Pazar]] area. The rest of the Allies, after giving a common ultimatum, declared war a week later. Bulgaria attacked towards Eastern Thrace, being stopped only at the outskirts of [[Constantinople]] at the [[Çatalca]] line and the isthmus of the [[Gallipoli peninsula]], while secondary forces captured Western Thrace and Eastern Macedonia. Serbia attacked south towards [[Skopje]] and [[Monastir, Macedonia|Monastir]] and then turned west to present-day [[Albania]], reaching [[Adriatica]], while a second Army captured [[Kosovo]] and linked with the Montenegrin forces. Greece's main forces attacked from [[Thessaly]] into Macedonia through the [[Sarantaporo]] strait and after capturing [[Thessaloniki]] on 12 November (on 26 October 1912, [[Old Style and New Style dates|O.S.]]) expanded its occupied area and linked up with the Serbian army to the northwest, while its main forces turned east towards [[Kavala]], reaching the Bulgarians. Another Greek army attacked into [[Epirus (region)|Epirus]] towards [[Ioannina]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BA01&quot;&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9011972 Balkan Wars] Encyclopædia Britannica Online.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the naval front the Ottoman fleet twice exited the [[Dardanelles]] and was twice defeated by the [[Greek Navy]], in the battles of [[Naval Battle of Elli|Elli]] and [[Naval Battle of Lemnos|Lemnos]]. Greek dominance on the [[Aegean Sea]] made it impossible for the Ottomans to transfer the planned troops from the Middle East to the Thracian (against the Bulgarian) and to the Macedonian (against the Greeks and Serbians) fronts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Erickson333&quot;&gt;Erickson (2003), p. 333&lt;/ref&gt; According to the E.J.Erickson the Greek Navy also played a crucial, albeit indirect role, in the Thracian campaign by neutralizing no less than three Thracian Corps (see [[First Balkan War]], the Bulgarian theater of operations), a significant portion of the Ottoman Army there, in the all-important opening round of the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;Erickson333&quot;/&gt; After the defeating of the Ottoman fleet the Greek Navy was also free to liberate the islands of the Aegean.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-26429 &quot;History of Greece&quot;] Encyclopædia Britannica Online&lt;/ref&gt; General [[Nikola Ivanov]] identified the activity of the Greek Navy as the chief factor in the general success of the allies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Erickson333&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hall (2000), p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;

In January, after a successful coup by young army officers, the Ottoman Empire decided to continue the war. After a failed Ottoman counter-attack in the Western-Thracian front, Bulgarian forces with the help of the Serbian Army managed to [[Battle of Adrianople (1913)|conquer Adrianople]] while Greek forces managed to take [[Ioannina]] after defeating the Ottomans in the [[battle of Bizani]]. In the joint Serbian-Montenegrin theater of operation the Montenegrin army besieged and captured the [[Shkodra]], ending the Ottoman presence in Europe west of the Çatalca line after nearly 500 years. The war ended with the [[Treaty of London, 1913|Treaty of London]] on 17 May 1913.

==Second Balkan War==
{{Main|Second Balkan War}}

[[File:Balkan Wars Boundaries.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Boundaries on the Balkans after the First and the Second Balkan War (1912–1913)]]
Though the Balkan allies had fought together against the common enemy, that was not enough to overcome their mutual rivalries. The Second Balkan War broke out on 16 June 1913 when Bulgaria attacked its erstwhile allies in the First Balkan War, Serbia and Greece, while Montenegro, Romania and the Ottoman Empire intervened later against Bulgaria. When the Greek army entered [[Thessaloniki]] in the First Balkan War ahead of the Bulgarian 7th division by only a day, they were asked to allow a Bulgarian battalion to enter the city. Greece accepted in exchange for allowing a Greek unit to enter the city of [[Serres, Greece|Serres]]

The Bulgarian unit that entered Thessaloniki turned out to be a 48,000-strong division instead of the battalion, something which caused concern among the Greeks, who viewed it as a Bulgarian attempt to establish a [[Condominium (international law)|condominium]] over the city. In the event, due to the urgently needed reinforcements in the Thracian front, Bulgarian Headquarters was soon forced to remove its troops from the city (while the Greeks agreed by mutual treaty to remove their units based in [[Serres]]) and transport them to Dedeağaç (modern [[Alexandroupolis]]), but still it left behind a battalion that started fortifying its positions.

Greece had also allowed the Bulgarians to control the stretch of the Thessaloniki-Constantinople railroad that lay in Greek-occupied territory, since Bulgaria controlled the largest part of this railroad towards Thrace. After the end of the operations in Thrace—and confirming Greek concerns—Bulgaria was not satisfied with the territory it controlled in Macedonia and immediately asked Greece to relinquish its control over Thessaloniki and the land north of [[Pieria (prefecture)|Pieria]], effectively handing over all Aegean Macedonia. These unacceptable demands together with the Bulgarian refusal to demobilize its army after the [[Treaty of London (1913)|Treaty of London]] had ended the common war against the Ottomans and alarmed Greece, which decided also to maintain its army's mobilization.

Similarly, in northern Macedonia, the tension between Serbia and Bulgaria due to later aspirations over [[Vardar Macedonia]] generated many incidents between the nearby armies, prompting Serbia to maintain its army's mobilization. Serbia and Greece proposed that each of the three countries reduce its army by one fourth, as a first step to facilitate a peaceful solution, but Bulgaria rejected it.
Seeing the omens, Greece and Serbia started a series of negotiations and signed a treaty on 19 May/1 June 1913. With this treaty, a mutual border was agreed between the two countries, together with an agreement for mutual military and diplomatic support in case of a Bulgarian or/and Austro-Hungarian attack. Tsar [[Nicholas II of Russia]], being well informed, tried to stop the upcoming conflict on 8 June, by sending an identical personal message to the Kings of Bulgaria and Serbia, offering to act as arbitrator according to the provisions of the 1912 Serbo-Bulgarian treaty. But Bulgaria, by making the acceptance of Russian [[arbitration]] conditional, in effect denied any discussion and caused Russia to repudiate its alliance with Bulgaria (see Russo-Bulgarian military convention signed 31 May 1902).

The Serbs and the Greeks had a military advantage on the eve of the war because their armies confronted comparatively weak Ottoman forces in the First Balkan War and suffered relatively light casualties&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall 2000, p. 117&quot;&gt;Hall (2000), p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; while the Bulgarians were involved in heavy fighting in Thrace. The Serbs and the Greeks had time to fortify their positions in Macedonia. The Bulgarians also held some advantages, controlling internal communication and supply lines.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall 2000, p. 117&quot;/&gt;

On 16 June 1913 General Savov, under direct orders of tsar [[Ferdinand of Bulgaria|Ferdinand I]], issued attacking orders against both Greece and Serbia without consulting the Bulgarian government and without any official declaration of war.&lt;ref name=&quot;macedonia-istinata&quot;&gt;{{cite web |date=Winter, 1995|url = http://macedonia-istinata.hit.bg/MacEnigma.html|title = THE MACEDONIAN ENIGMA|publisher = Magazine: Australia &amp;World Affairs, | accessdate = 2008-04-15 | last=George Phillipov |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the night of 17 June 1913 they attacked the Serbian army at [[Bregalnica river]] and then the Greek army in [[Nigrita]]. The Serbian army resisted the sudden night attack, while most of soldiers did not even know who they are fighting with, as Bulgarian camps were located next to Serbs and were considered allies. Montenegro's forces were just a few kilometeres away and also rushed to the battle. The Bulgarian attack was halted.

The Greek army was also successful.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall 2000, p. 117&quot;/&gt; It retreated according to plan for two days while [[Thessaloniki]] was cleared of the remaining Bulgarian regiment. Then the Greek army counter-attacked and defeated the Bulgarians at [[Battle of Kilkis-Lahanas|Kilkis-Lahanas]], after which the mostly Bulgarian town was destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Poulton, &quot;Who are the Macedonians?&quot;, 2000, p.75&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Balkan Forum&quot;, Volume 5, Issues 1-2, 1997, p.132&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Greek army's pace was not quick enough to prevent the massacre of Greek peaceable inhabitants at [[Nigrita]], [[Serres]], [[Drama]] and [[Doxato]].&lt;ref&gt;The Great Events by Famous Historians, Charles F. Horne, 2006, ISBN 978-1426441073, p. 420&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek army then divided its forces and advanced in two directions. Part proceeded east and occupied [[Western Thrace]]. The rest of the Greek army advanced up to the [[Struma River]] valley, defeating the Bulgarian army in the battles of [[Battle of Doiran|Doiran]] and Mt. Beles, and continued its advance to the north towards [[Sofia]]. In the [[Battle of Kresna Gorge|Kresna straits]] the Greeks were ambushed by the Bulgarian 2nd and 1st Army newly arrived from the Serbian front that had already taken defensive positions there following the Bulgarian victory at [[battle of Kalimanci|Kalimanci]].

By 30 July the Greek army was outnumbered by the counter-attacking Bulgarian army, which attempted to encircle the Greeks in a Cannae-type battle, by applying pressure on their flanks.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall&quot;&gt;{{cite book| last =Hall | first =Richard | title =The Balkan Wars, 1912-1913: Prelude to the First World War| publisher =Routledge| year =2000 | isbn =0415229464 | page =121 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek army resisted successfully however, launching local counter-attacks. The battle was continued for 11 days, between 29 July and 9 August over 20&amp;nbsp;km of a maze of forests and mountains with no conclusion. The Greek King, seeing that the units he fought were from the Serbian front, tried to convince the Serbs to renew their attack, as the front ahead them was now thinner, but the Serbs rejected it. By then, news came of the Romanian advance toward Sofia and its imminent fall. After that, Constantine, realizing the futility of continuing the counterattack, agreed to [[Eleftherios Venizelos]]' proposal and accepted the Bulgarian request for armistice as this had been communicated through Romania.

Romania had raised an army and declared war on Bulgaria on 27 June as it had from 15 June officially warned Bulgaria that it would not remain neutral in a new Balkan war, due to Bulgaria's refusal to cede the fortress of Silistra as promised before the First Balkan war in exchange for Romanian neutrality. Its forces encountered little resistance and by the time the Greeks accepted the Bulgarian request for armistice they had reached [[Vrazhdebna]], 7 miles from the center of [[Sofia]].

Seeing the military position of the Bulgarian army the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] decided to intervene. They attacked and finding no opposition, managed to recover eastern [[Thrace]] with its fortified city of [[Edirne|Adrianople]], regaining an area in Europe which was only slightly larger than the present-day European territory of the [[Republic of Turkey]].

==Reactions among the Great Powers during the wars==
The developments that led to the '''First Balkan War''' did not go unnoticed by the Great Powers, but although there was an official consensus between the European Powers over the [[Eastern Question|territorial integrity of the Ottoman Empire]], which led to a stern warning to the Balkan states, unofficially each of them took a different diplomatic approach due to their conflicting interests in the area. As a result, any possible preventive effect of the common official warning was cancelled by the mixed unofficial signals, and failed to prevent or to stop the war:

*[[Russian Empire|Russia]] was a prime mover in the establishment of the Balkan League and saw it as an essential tool in case of a future war against its rival, the Austro-Hungarian Empire.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stowell1&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Stowell | first = Ellery Cory | title =The Diplomacy Of The War Of 1914: The Beginnings Of The War (1915) | publisher = Kessinger Publishing, LLC. | year =2009 | isbn =978-1104487584 | page =94 }}&lt;/ref&gt; But it was unaware of the Bulgarian plans over Thrace and Constantinople, territories on which it had long-held ambitions, and on which it had just secured a secret agreement of expansion from its allies France and Britain, as a reward for participating in the upcoming [[World War I|Great War]] against the [[Central Powers]].

*[[French Third Republic|France]], not feeling ready for a war against Germany in 1912, took a totally negative position against the war, firmly informing its ally Russia that it would not take part in a potential conflict between Russia and Austria-Hungary if it resulted from the actions of the Balkan League. The French however failed to achieve British participation in a common intervention to stop the Balkan conflict.

*The [[British Empire]], although officially a staunch supporter of the Ottoman Empire's integrity, took secret diplomatic steps encouraging Greek entry into the League in order to counteract Russian influence. At the same time it encouraged Bulgarian aspirations over Thrace, preferring a Bulgarian Thrace to a Russian one, despite the assurances the British had given to the Russians in regard to their expansion there.

*[[Austria-Hungary]], struggling for a port on the [[Adriatic]] and seeking ways for expansion in the south at the expense of the Ottoman Empire, was totally opposed to any other nation's expansion in the area. At the same time, the Habsburg empire had its own internal problems with significant Slav populations that campaigned against German-Hungarian control of the multinational state. Serbia, whose aspirations in the direction of Austrian-held Bosnia were no secret, was considered an enemy and the main tool of Russian machinations that were behind the agitation of Austria's Slav subjects. But Austria-Hungary failed to secure German backup for a firm reaction. Initially, Emperor [[Wilhelm II]] told the [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Archduke Franz Ferdinand]] that Germany was ready to support Austria in all circumstances—even at the risk of a world war, but the Austro-Hungarians hesitated. Finally, in the [[German Imperial War Council of 8 December 1912]] the consensus was that Germany would not be ready for war until at least mid-1914 and passed notes about that to the Habsburgs. Consequently no actions could be taken when the Serbs acceded to the Austrian ultimatum of 18 October and withdrew from Albania.

*[[German Empire|Germany]], already heavily involved in internal Ottoman politics, officially opposed a war against the Empire. But in her effort to win Bulgaria for the [[Central Powers]], and seeing the [[Sick man of Europe|inevitability]] of Ottoman disintegration, was toying with the idea of replacing the Balkan area of the Ottomans with a friendly Greater Bulgaria in her [[Treaty of San Stefano|San Stefano]] borders—an idea that was based on the German origin of the [[Ferdinand of Bulgaria|Bulgarian King]] and his anti-Russian sentiments.

The '''Second Balkan war''' was a catastrophic blow to Russian policies in the Balkans, where Russia had focused its interests for access to the &quot;warm seas&quot; for centuries. First, it marked the end of the Balkan League, a vital arm of the Russian system of defense against Austria-Hungary. Second, the clearly pro-Serbian position Russia had been forced to take in the conflict, mainly due to Bulgaria's uncompromising aggressiveness, caused a permanent break-up between the two countries. Accordingly, Bulgaria reverted its policy to one closer to the [[Central Powers]]' understanding over an anti-Serbian front, due to its new national aspirations, now expressed mainly against Serbia. As a result, Serbia was isolated militarily against its rival Austria-Hungary, a development that eventually doomed Serbia in the coming war a year later. But most damaging, the new situation effectively trapped Russian foreign policy: After 1913, Russia could not afford losing its last ally in this crucial area and thus had no alternatives but to unconditionally support Serbia when the crisis between Serbia and Austria broke out in 1914. This was a position that inevitably drew her, although unwillingly, into a World War with devastating results for her, since she was less prepared (both militarily and socially) for that event than any other Great Power.

Austria-Hungary took alarm at the great increase in Serbia's territory at the expense of its national aspirations in the region, as well as Serbia's rising status, especially to Austria-Hungary's Slavic populations. This concern was shared by Germany, which saw Serbia as a satellite of Russia. This contributed significantly to the two Central Powers' willingness to go to war as soon as possible.

Finally, when [[Black Hand|a Serbian backed organization]] assassinated [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|the heir of the Austro-Hungarian throne]], causing the 1914 [[July Crisis]], nobody could stop the conflict and the [[World War I|First World War]] broke out.

==Aftermath==
[[Urlanis]] estimated in ''Voini I Narodo-Nacelenie Europi'' (1960) that in the first and second Balkan wars there were 122,000 killed in action, 20,000 dead of wounds, and 82,000 dead of disease.

The '''BeBox''' was a short-lived dual processor [[personal computer]], offered by [[Be Inc.]] to run the company's own [[operating system]], [[BeOS]]. Notable aspects of the system include its CPU configuration, I/O board with &quot;GeekPort&quot;, and &quot;[[Blinkenlights]]&quot; on the front bezel.

The BeBox made its debut in October 1995 (BeBox Dual603-66). The processors were upgraded to 133&amp;nbsp;MHz in August 1996 (BeBox Dual603e-133). Production was halted in January 1997&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bebox.nu/history.php?s=history/1997 BeBox History] The BeBox Zone&lt;/ref&gt;, following the port of BeOS to the [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]], in order for the company to concentrate on software. Be sold around 1000 66&amp;nbsp;MHz BeBoxes and 800 133&amp;nbsp;MHz BeBoxes.

== CPU Configuration ==
Initial prototypes were equipped with two [[AT&amp;T Hobbit]] processors and three AT&amp;T 9308S [[digital signal processor|DSP]]s.

Production models used two [[PowerPC 600#PowerPC 603|PowerPC 603]] [[Central processing unit|processors]] running at 66 or 133 [[Megahertz|MHz]] to power the BeBox. Prototypes having dual 200&amp;nbsp;MHz CPUs or four CPUs exist, but these were never publicly available.

== I/O board ==
* Four serial ports (9-pin D-shell)
* One mouse port, PS/2-type
* Two joystick ports (15-pin D-shell)
* Two MIDI out ports
* Two MIDI in ports
* Three infrared (IR) I/O ports (6-pin mini DIN)
* One internal CD audio line-level input (5-pin strip)
* One internal microphone audio input (4-pin strip)
* One internal headphone audio output (4-pin strip)
* Two line-level RCA inputs (L/R)
* Two line-level outputs (L/R)

'''Biomedical engineering''' is the application of engineering principles and design concepts to medicine and biology. This field seeks to close the gap between '''[[engineering]]''' and '''[[medicine]]''': It combines the design and problem solving skills of engineering with medical and biological sciences to improve healthcare [[Medical diagnosis|diagnosis]], [[Medical monitor|monitoring]] and [[therapy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prospects.ac.uk/p/types_of_job/biomedical_engineer_job_description.jsp Biomedical engineer] prospects&lt;/ref&gt;

Biomedical engineering has only recently emerged as its own discipline, compared to many other engineering fields.  Such an evolution is common as a new field transitions from being an [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] specialization among already-established fields, to being considered a field in itself. Much of the work in biomedical engineering consists of [[research and development]], spanning a broad array of subfields (see below). Prominent biomedical engineering applications include the development of [[biocompatible]] [[prosthesis|prostheses]], various diagnostic and therapeutic [[medical device]]s ranging from clinical equipment to micro-implants, common imaging equipment such as [[MRI]]s and [[EEG]]s, biotechnologies such as regenerative tissue growth, and pharmaceutical [[medication|drugs]] and biopharmaceuticals.

==Subdisciplines within biomedical engineering==

Biomedical engineering is a highly interdisciplinary field, influenced by (and overlapping with) various other engineering and medical fields. This often happens with newer disciplines, as they gradually emerge in their own right after evolving from special applications of extant disciplines.  Due to this diversity, it is typical for a biomedical engineer to focus on a particular subfield or group of related subfields. There are many different taxonomic breakdowns within BME, as well as varying views about how best to organize them and manage any internal overlap; the main U.S. organization devoted to BME divides the major specialty areas as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bmes.org/mc/page.do?sitePageId=71344&amp;orgId=bes], About BMES - Specialty Areas within BME&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Electronics and biomedical engineering|Biomedical Electronics]]
*[[Biomechatronics]]
*Bioinstrumentation
*[[Biomaterials]]
*[[Biomechanics]]
*[[Bionics]]
*Cellular, Tissue, and Genetic Engineering
*[[Clinical Engineering]]
*[[Medical Imaging]]
*Orthopaedic Bioengineering
*[[Rehabilitation engineering]]
*Systems Physiology
*Bionanotechnology
*Neural Engineering

Sometimes, disciplines within BME are classified by their association(s) with other, more established engineering fields, which can include:
*[[Chemical engineering]] - often associated with [[biochemical engineering|biochemical]], cellular, [[molecular engineering|molecular]] and [[tissue engineering]], [[biomaterials]], and [[transport phenomena|biotransport]].
*[[Electrical engineering]] - often associated with [[bioelectricity|bioelectrical]] and [[neural engineering]], bioinstrumentation, biomedical imaging, and [[medical devices]]. This also tends to encompass [[Optics]] and [[Optical engineering]] - biomedical optics, imaging and related [[medical devices]].
*[[Mechanical engineering]] - often associated with [[biomechanics]], [[transport phenomena|biotransport]], [[medical devices]], and modeling of [[systems biology|biological systems]], like [[soft tissue]] mechanics.

===Biotechnology and pharmaceuticals===

[[Biotechnology]] (see also relatedly [[bioengineering]]) can be a somewhat ambiguous term, sometimes loosely used interchangeably with BME in general; however, it more typically denotes specific products which use &quot;biological systems, living organisms, or derivatives thereof.&quot; [http://www.cbd.int/convention/convention.shtml]  Even some complex &quot;medical devices&quot; (see below) can reasonably be deemed &quot;biotechnology&quot; depending on the degree to which such elements are central to their principle of operation.  Biologics/Biopharmaceuticals (e.g., vaccines, stored blood product), genetic engineering, and various agricultural applications are some major classes of biotechnology.

Pharmaceuticals are related to biotechnology in two indirect ways: 1) certain major types (e.g. biologics) fall under both categories, and 2) together they essentially comprise the &quot;''non''-medical-device&quot; set of BME applications.  (The &quot;Device - Bio/Chemical&quot; spectrum is an imperfect dichotomy, but one regulators often use, at least as a starting point.)

====Tissue engineering====
{{Main|Tissue engineering}}

Tissue engineering is a major segment of ''Biotechnology''.

One of the goals of tissue engineering is to create artificial organs (via biological material) for patients that need organ transplants. Biomedical engineers are currently researching methods of creating such organs. Researchers have grown solid [[Human jawbone|jawbone]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
| title = Jaw bone created from stem cells
| work = [[BBC News]]
| date =  October 10, 2009 |   accessdate = 11 October 2009
| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/8290138.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]]s from human stem cells towards this end. Several [[artificial urinary bladder]]s actually have been grown in laboratories and transplanted successfully into human patients.&lt;ref name=&quot;cnngrow&quot;&gt;{{cite news

| title = Doctors grow organs from patients' own cells
| work = [[CNN]]
|  date =  April 3, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bioartificial organs, which use both synthetic and biological components, are also a focus area in research, such as with hepatic assist devices that use liver cells within an artificial bioreactor construct.&lt;ref name=&quot;chicagoliver&quot;&gt;[http://www.uchospitals.edu/news/1999/19990225-elad.html  Trial begins for first artificial liver device using human cells], [[University of Chicago]], February 25, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Alcian stain micromass.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Micromass cultures of C3H-10T1/2 cells at varied oxygen tensions stained with [[Alcian blue]].]]

====Genetic Engineering====

Genetic engineering, recombinant DNA technology, genetic modification/manipulation (GM) and gene splicing are terms that apply to the direct manipulation of an organism's genes.[1] Genetic engineering is different from traditional breeding, where the organism's genes are manipulated indirectly. Genetic engineering uses the techniques of molecular cloning and transformation to alter the structure and characteristics of genes directly. Genetic engineering techniques have found success in numerous applications. Some examples are in improving crop technology (not a medical application per se; see [[BioSystems Engineering]]), the manufacture of synthetic human insulin through the use of modified bacteria, the manufacture of erythropoietin in hamster ovary cells, and the production of new types of experimental mice such as the oncomouse (cancer mouse) for research.

====Neural Engineering====

[[Neural engineering]] (also known as Neuroengineering) is a discipline that uses engineering techniques to understand, repair, replace, or enhance neural systems. Neural engineers are uniquely qualified to solve design problems at the interface of living neural tissue and non-living constructs.

====Pharmaceutical engineering====

Pharmaceutical Engineering is sometimes regarded as a branch of biomedical engineering, and sometimes a branch of [[chemical engineering]]; in practice, it is very much a hybrid sub-discipline (as many BME fields are). Aside from those pharmaceutical products directly incorporating biological agents or materials, even developing chemical drugs is considered to require substantial BME knowledge due to the physiological interactions inherent to such products' usage.

===Medical devices===
{{Main|Medical devices|medical equipment|Medical technology}}

This is an ''extremely broad category'' -- essentially covering all health care products that do '''not''' achieve their intended results through predominantly chemical (e.g., pharmaceuticals) or biological (e.g., vaccines) means, and do not involve metabolism.

A medical device is intended for use in:
* the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or
* in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease,

[[Image:insulin pump with infusion set.jpg|200px|right|thumb|A [[insulin pump|pump]] for continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion, an example of a biomedical engineering application of [[electrical engineering]] to [[medical equipment]].]]
Some examples include [[artificial pacemaker|pacemaker]]s, [[infusion pump]]s, the [[heart-lung machine]], [[dialysis]] machines, [[tissue engineering|artificial organs]], [[implant (medicine)|implants]], [[artificial limb]]s, [[corrective lenses]], [[cochlear implant]]s, [[ocular prosthetics]], [[facial prosthetics]], somato prosthetics, and [[dental implant]]s.
[[Image:Opampinstrumentation.svg|250px|right|thumb|Biomedical [[instrumentation amplifier]] schematic used in monitoring low voltage biological signals, an example of a biomedical engineering application of [[electronic engineering]] to [[electrophysiology]].]]

[[Stereolithography]] is a practical example of ''medical modeling'' being used to create physical objects. Beyond modeling organs and the human body, emerging engineering techniques are also currently used in the research and development of new devices for innovative [http://www.cancerjournal.net/article.asp?issn=0973-1482;year=2006;volume=2;issue=4;spage=186;epage=195;aulast=Hede therapies], [http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/klu/pham/2006/00000023/00000007/00010284;jsessionid=8tqn6da8a03l0.alice treatments], [http://www.ncd.gov/newsroom/publications/2006/emerging_trends.htm patient monitoring], and early [http://www.futuremedicine.com/doi/abs/10.2217/17435889.1.1.67 diagnosis] of complex diseases.

Medical devices are regulated and classified (in the US) as follows (see also ''Regulation''):

#Class I devices present minimal potential for harm to the user and are often simpler in design than Class II or Class III devices.  Devices in this category include tongue depressors, bedpans, elastic bandages, examination gloves, and hand-held surgical instruments and other similar types of common equipment.
#Class II devices are subject to special controls in addition to the general controls of Class I devices. Special controls may include special labeling requirements, mandatory performance standards, and [[Postmarketing surveillance|postmarket surveillance]]. Devices in this class are typically non-invasive and include x-ray machines, PACS, powered wheelchairs, infusion pumps, and surgical drapes.
#Class III devices generally require premarket approval (PMA) or premarket notification (510k), a scientific review to ensure the device's safety and effectiveness, in addition to the general controls of Class I.  Examples include replacement heart valves, hip and knee joint implants, silicone gel-filled breast implants, implanted cerebellar stimulators, implantable pacemaker pulse generators and endosseous (intra-bone) implants.

====Medical imaging====
{{Main|Medical imaging}}

Medical/biomedical imaging is a major segment of [[medical device]]s. This area deals with enabling clinicians to directly or indirectly &quot;view&quot; things not visible in plain sight (such as due to their size, and/or location).  This can involve utilizing ultrasound, magnetism, UV, other radiology, and other means.

[[Image:brain chrischan.jpg|thumb|200px|right|An [[MRI]] scan of a human head, an example of a  biomedical engineering application of [[electrical engineering]] to [[diagnostic imaging]].  [[:Image:brain chrischan 300.gif|Click here]] to view an animated sequence of slices.]]Imaging technologies are often essential to medical diagnosis, and are typically the most complex equipment found in a hospital including:
*[[Fluoroscopy]]
*[[Magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI)
*[[Nuclear medicine]]
*[[Positron emission tomography]] (PET) [[Positron emission tomography|PET scans]][[PET-CT scanning|PET-CT scans]]
*Projection radiography such as [[X-ray]]s and [[Computed tomography|CT scans]]
*[[Tomography]]
*[[Ultrasound]]
*[[Optical microscopy]]
*[[Electron microscopy]]

====Implants====

An implant is a kind of medical device made to replace and act as a missing biological structure (as compared with a transplant, which indicates transplanted biomedical tissue). The surface of implants that contact the body might be made of a biomedical material such as titanium, silicone or apatite depending on what is the most functional. In some cases implants contain electronics e.g. artificial pacemaker and cochlear implants. Some implants are bioactive, such as subcutaneous drug delivery devices in the form of implantable pills or drug-eluting stents.

[[Image:Prosthetic eye.png|thumb|200px|A [[prosthetic eye]], an example of a biomedical engineering application of [[mechanical engineering]] and [[biocompatible material]]s to [[ophthalmology]].]]

===Clinical engineering===
{{Main|Clinical engineering}}

[[Clinical engineering]] is the branch of biomedical engineering dealing with the actual implementation of [[medical equipment]] and technologies in hospitals or other clinical settings. Major roles of clinical engineers include training and supervising [[Biomedical Equipment Technician|biomedical equipment technicians (BMETs)]], selecting technological products/services and logistically managing their implementation, working with governmental regulators on inspections/audits, and serving as technological consultants for other hospital staff (e.g. physicians, administrators, I.T., etc.). Clinical engineers also advise and collaborate with medical device producers regarding prospective design improvements based on clinical experiences, as well as monitor the progression of the state-of-the-art so as to redirect procurement patterns accordingly.

Their inherent focus on ''practical'' implementation of technology has tended to keep them oriented more towards ''incremental''-level redesigns and reconfigurations, as opposed to revolutionary research &amp; development or ideas that would be many years from clinical adoption; however, there is a growing effort to expand this time-horizon over which clinical engineers can influence the trajectory of biomedical innovation. In their various roles, they form a &quot;bridge&quot; between the primary designers and the end-users, by combining the perspectives of being both 1) close to the point-of-use, while 2) trained in product and process engineering. Clinical Engineering departments will sometimes hire not just biomedical engineers, but also industrial/systems engineers to help address operations research/optimization, human factors, cost analysis, etc. Also see [[safety engineering]] for a discussion of the procedures used to design safe systems.

[[Image:SinusRhythmLabels.svg|200px|right|thumb|Schematic representation of a normal ECG trace showing ''[[sinus rhythm]];'' an example of widely-used clinical medical equipment (operates by applying [[electronic engineering]] to [[electrophysiology]] and [[medical diagnosis]].]]

A point of reference for clinical engineers would be the catalogue published by The American Society for Hospital Engineering in the Hospital Engineering Reference Series called Maintenance Management for Medical Equipment

==Regulatory issues==

Regulatory issues are of particular concern to a biomedical engineer; it is among the most heavily-regulated fields of engineering, and practicing biomedical engineers must routinely consult and cooperate with regulatory law attorneys and other experts.  The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is the principal healthcare regulatory authority in the United States, having jurisdiction over medical ''devices, drugs, biologics, and combination'' products.  The paramount objectives driving policy decisions by the FDA are '''safety''' and '''efficacy''' of healthcare products.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

In addition, because biomedical engineers often develop devices and technologies for &quot;consumer&quot; use, such as physical therapy devices (which are also &quot;medical&quot; devices), these may also be governed in some respects by the [[Consumer Product Safety Commission]]. The greatest hurdles tend to be 510K &quot;clearance&quot; (typically for Class 2 devices) or pre-market &quot;approval&quot; (typically for drugs and class 3 devices).

[[Image:Hip replacement Image 3684-PH.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Implants, such as [[artificial hip]] joints, are generally extensively regulated due to the invasive nature of such devices.]]

Most countries have their own particular mechanisms for regulation, with varying formulations and degrees of restrictiveness.  In most European countries, more discretion rests with the prescribing doctor, while the regulations chiefly assure that the product operates as expected.  In European Union nations, the national governments license certifying agencies, which are for-profit companies.  Technical committees of engineers write recommendations which incorporate public comments, and these can be adopted as regulations by the [[European Union]].  These recommendations vary by the type of device, and specify tests for safety and efficacy.  Once a prototype has passed the tests at a certification lab, and that model is being constructed under the control of a certified quality system, the device is entitled to bear a [[CE mark]], indicating that the device is believed to be safe and reliable when used as directed.

The different regulatory arrangements sometimes result in particular technologies being developed first for either the U.S. or in Europe depending on the more favorable form of regulation.  While nations often strive for substantive harmony to facilitate cross-national distribution, philosophical differences about the ''optimal extent'' of regulation can be a hindrance; more restrictive regulations seem appealing on an intuitive level, but critics decry the tradeoff cost in terms of slowing access to life-saving developments.

== Training and certification ==
=== Education ===

Biomedical engineers require considerable knowledge of both engineering and biology, and typically have a Master's (M.S., M.S.E., or M.Eng.) or a Doctoral (Ph.D.) degree in BME or another branch of engineering with considerable potential for BME overlap. As interest in BME is increasing, many engineering colleges now have a Biomedical Engineering Department or Program, with offerings ranging from the undergraduate (B.S. or B.S.E.) to the doctoral levels. As noted above, biomedical engineering has only recently been emerging as ''its own discipline'' rather than a cross-disciplinary hybrid specialization of other disciplines; now, BME programs of study at all levels are becoming more widespread, including the [[Bachelor of Science in Biomedical Engineering]] which actually includes so much biological science content that many students use it as a &quot;pre-med&quot; major in preparation for [[medical school]]. The number of biomedical engineers is expected to rise as both a cause and effect of improvements in medical technology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos027.htm U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics] - Profile for Engineers&lt;/ref&gt;

In the U.S., an increasing number of [[undergraduate]] programs are also becoming recognized by [[ABET]] as accredited bioengineering/biomedical engineering programs. Over 65 programs are currently accredited by ABET.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bmes.org/accreditation/accredited_eng_pgms.asp Accredited Biomedical Engineering Programs]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abet.org/schoolalleac.asp ABET List of Accredited Engineering Programs]&lt;/ref&gt;

As with many degrees, the reputation and ranking of a program may factor into the desirability of a degree holder for either employment or graduate admission. The reputation of many undergraduate degrees are also linked to the institution's graduate or research programs, which have some tangible factors for rating, such as research funding and volume, publications and citations. With BME specifically, the ranking of a university's hospital and medical school can also be a significant factor in the perceived prestige of its BME department/program.

[[Graduate school|Graduate education]] is a particularly important aspect in BME. While many engineering fields (such as mechanical or electrical engineering) do not need graduate-level training to obtain an entry-level job in their field, the majority of BME positions do prefer or even require them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos027.htm#outlook U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics] - Job Outlook for Engineers&lt;/ref&gt; Since most BME-related professions involve scientific research, such as in [[pharmaceutical]] and [[medical device]] development, graduate education is almost a requirement (as undergraduate degrees typically do not involve sufficient research training and experience). This can be either a '''Masters''' or '''Doctoral''' level degree; while in certain specialties a Ph.D. is notably more common than in others, it is hardly ever the majority (except in academia). In fact, the perceived need for some kind of graduate credential is so strong that some undergraduate BME programs will actively discourage students from majoring in BME without an expressed intention to also obtain a masters degree or apply to medical school afterwards.

Graduate programs in BME, like in other scientific fields, are highly varied, and particular programs may emphasize certain aspects within the field. They may also feature extensive collaborative efforts with programs in other fields (such as the University's Medical School or other engineering divisions), owing again to the interdisciplinary nature of BME. M.S. and Ph.D. programs will typically require applicants to have an undergraduate degree in BME, or ''another engineering'' discipline (plus certain life science coursework), or ''life science'' (plus certain engineering coursework).

Education in BME also varies greatly around the world. By virtue of its extensive biotechnology sector, its numerous major universities, and relatively few internal barriers, the U.S. has progressed a great deal in its development of BME education and training opportunities. Europe, which also has a large biotechnology sector and an impressive education system, has encountered trouble in creating uniform standards as the European community attempts to supplant some of the national jurisdictional barriers that still exist. Recently, initiatives such as BIOMEDEA have sprung up to develop BME-related education and professional standards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bmt.uni-stuttgart.de/biomedea/biomedea.htm BIOMEDEA]&lt;/ref&gt; Other countries, such as Australia, are recognizing and moving to correct deficiencies in their BME education.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stinet.dtic.mil/oai/oai?&amp;verb=getRecord&amp;metadataPrefix=html&amp;identifier=ADA410442 Biomedical Engineering Curriculum:] A Comparison Between the USA, Europe and Australia&lt;/ref&gt; Also, as high technology endeavors are usually marks of developed nations, some areas of the world are prone to slower development in education, including in BME.

===Licensure/Certification===
{{See also|Professional engineer}}
Engineering licensure in the US is largely optional, and rarely specified by branch/discipline. As with other learned professions, each state has certain (fairly similar) requirements for becoming licensed as a registered [[professional engineer]] (PE), but in practice such a license is not required to practice in the majority of situations (due to an exception known as the private industry exemption, which effectively applies to the vast majority of American engineers).  This is notably not the case in many other countries, where a license is as legally necessary to practice engineering as it is for law or medicine.

Biomedical engineering is regulated in some countries, such as Australia, but registration is typically only recommended and not required.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nerb.org.au/aop/nper_areas_biomedical.cfm National Engineering Registration Board - Areas Of Practice - NPER Areas&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK, mechanical engineers working in the areas of Medical Engineering, [[Bioengineering]] or Biomedical engineering can gain [[Chartered Engineer (UK)|Chartered Engineer]] status through the [[Institution of Mechanical Engineers]].  The Institution also runs the Engineering in Medicine and Health Division.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imeche.org/industries/medical/&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Fundamentals of Engineering exam]] - the first (and more general) of two licensure examinations for most U.S. jurisdictions—does now cover biology (although technically not BME).  For the second exam, called Part 2 or the Professional Engineering exam, candidates may select a particular engineering discipline's content to be tested on; there is currently not an option for BME with this, meaning that any biomedical engineers seeking a license must prepare to take this examination in another category (which does not affect the actual license, since most jurisdictions do not recognize discipline specialties anyway).  However, the Biomedical Engineering Society (BMES) is, as of 2009, exploring the possibility of seeking to implement a BME-specific version of this exam to facilitate biomedical engineers pursuing licensure.

Beyond governmental registration, certain private-sector professional/industrial organizations also offer certifications with varying degrees of prominence.  One such example is the Certified Clinical Engineer (CCE) certification for Clinical engineers.

[[File:Balkan topo en.jpg|thumb|350px|right|The Balkan peninsula as defined by the [[Soča]]-[[Krka River (Slovenia)|Krka]]-[[Sava River|Sava]] border in the north.]]
The '''Balkans''' (often referred to as the '''Balkan Peninsula''', although the two are not coterminous) is a geopolitical and cultural region of southeastern [[Europe]]. The region takes its name from the [[Balkan Mountains]], which run through the centre of [[Bulgaria]] into eastern [[Serbia]].
The region has a combined area of {{convert|550000|km2|sqmi|sigfig=3|abbr=on}} and a population of 55 million people.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

&quot;''{{lang|tr|Balkan}}''&quot; comes from a [[Turkish language|Turkish]] word meaning &quot;a chain of wooded mountains&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Balkan.&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_/balkan.html|title=Balkan.|work=Encarta World English Dictionary|publisher=Microsoft Corporation|accessdate=2008-03-31|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5kwPqi7mD|archivedate=2009-10-31|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient [[Greek language|Greek]] name for the Balkan Peninsula was the &quot;Peninsula of [[Haemus]]” ({{polytonic|Χερσόνησος τοῦ Αἵμου}}, ''Chersónēsos tou Haímou''). [[Roman Empire|Romans]] considered the [[Rhodope Mountains]] to be the northern limit of the Peninsula of Haemus and the same limit applied approximately to the border between Greek and Latin use in the region (this was later called [[Jireček Line]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jstor.org/pss/3063446 Boundary between Greek and Latin]&lt;/ref&gt;). The Balkans are also referred to as '''[[Southeastern Europe]]'''.

==Definitions and boundaries==
===The Balkan Peninsula===
[[File:Balkanpeninsula.png|thumb|300px|The Balkan Peninsula, as defined by the Danube-Sava-Kupa line.]]
The Balkan Peninsula may be defined as an area of southeastern Europe surrounded by water on three sides: the [[Adriatic Sea]] to the west, the [[Mediterranean Sea]] (including the [[Ionian sea|Ionian]] and [[Aegean sea|Aegean]] seas) to the south and the [[Black Sea]] to the east. Its northern boundary is often given as the [[Danube]], [[Sava]] and [[Kupa]] rivers.&lt;ref name=jel01&gt;{{cite book |title=History of the Balkans: Eighteenth and nineteenth centuries |last=Jelavich |first=Barbara |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1983 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location= |isbn=978-0-521-27458-6 |page=1 |pages= |url=http://books.google.com/?id=qR4EeOrTm-0C&amp;printsec=frontcover}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Stielers Handatlas 1891 50.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Political map of the Balkans in 1891.]]
Countries that are geographically fully located within the Balkan peninsula (excluding islands):
*{{ALB}}
*{{BIH}}
*{{BUL}}
*{{GRE}}
*{{MKD}}
*{{MNE}}

Countries that are significantly located on the peninsula:
* {{SRB}} (south of the Sava and Danube rivers).
* {{CRO}} (south of the Sava and Kupa rivers, including Istria)

Countries that are located mostly outside the peninsula:

* {{SLO}}
* {{ROU}} ([[Northern Dobruja]])
* {{TUR}} ([[Eastern Thrace]])

===The Balkans===
The term &quot;The Balkans&quot; covers not only those countries which lie within the boundaries of the &quot;Balkan Peninsula&quot;, but may also include [[Slovenia]], and [[Romania]].&lt;ref name=jel01/&gt; Slovenia, which was part of [[Yugoslavia]] from 1919 to 1991, lies partially south of the Danube-Sava line, and thus its part is in the Balkans. Prior to 1991 the whole of Yugoslavia was considered to be part of the Balkans.&lt;ref name=&quot;tin51&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=World Geography Affected by World Upheavals |last=Tintero |first=Felipa L. |authorlink= |coauthors=Felicitas R. Manacsa |year= |publisher=Goodwill Trading Co., Inc. |location= |isbn=9715740413 |page=51 |pages= |url=http://books.google.com/?id=jsnlxH9nnn4C&amp;printsec=frontcover }}&lt;/ref&gt; The father of the term &quot;The Balkans&quot; [[August Zeune]] defined it in 1808 to describe areas that remained under Turkish rule after 1699.

In most of the English-speaking world, the countries commonly included in the Balkan region are:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9110555/Balkans britannica.com]; [http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761567023/Balkan_Peninsula.html encarta.msn.com] ([http://www.webcitation.org/5kwPrEUsv Archived] 2009-10-31); [http://www.bartleby.com/65/ba/BalkanPe.html The Columbia Encyclopedia].&lt;/ref&gt;
*{{ALB}}
*{{BIH}}
*{{BUL}}
*{{CRO}}
*{{GRE}}
*{{MKD}}
*{{MNE}}
*{{SRB}}
*{{SLO}}

Other countries sometimes included are:
*{{MDA}}
*{{ROU}}
*{{TUR}}

[[Italy]] until [[World War II]] included [[Istria]] and some [[Dalmatia|Dalmatian areas]] (like ''Zara'', known as [[Zadar]]), but now it has only the small area of the [[Province of Trieste]] inside the Balkan region. However, Trieste and Istria are usually considered not part of the Balkans by Italian geographers, due to a definition of the Balkans that limits its western border to the Kupa river.&lt;ref&gt;Istituto Geografico De Agostini, ''L'Enciclopedia Geografica - Vol.I - Italia'', 2004, Ed. De Agostini p.78&lt;/ref&gt;

===Etymology and evolving meaning===
The region takes its name from the [[Stara Planina]] (Old Mountain)  mountain range on the border between [[Bulgaria]] and [[Serbia]], commonly known as the [[Balkan Mountains]] (from the [[Turkish language|Turkish]] {{lang|tr|''balkan''}} meaning &quot;a chain of wooded mountains&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;Balkan.&quot;/&gt; The name is still preserved in [[Central Asia]] where there exist the [[Balkan Daglary|Balkan Mountains]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://land.worldcitydb.com/balkhan_mountains_3522246.html|title=Balkhan Mountains.|work=World Land Features Database|publisher=Land.WorldCityDB.com|accessdate=2008-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Balkan Province]] of [[Turkmenistan]]. On a larger scale, the mountains are only one part of a long continuous chain of mountains crossing the region in the form of a reversed letter S, from the [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]] south to the Balkan range proper, before marching away east into [[Anatolia]]n Turkey. On the west coast, an offshoot of the [[Dinaric Alps]] follows the coast south through [[Dalmatia]] and [[Albania]], crosses Greece and continues into the sea in the form of various islands.

The first attested time the name &quot;Balkan&quot; was used in the West for the mountain range in Bulgaria was in a letter sent in 1490 to Pope [[Innocent VIII]] by Buonaccorsi Callimaco, an Italian humanist, writer and diplomat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Todorova|first=Maria|title=Imagining the Balkans|page=22|publisher=Oxford University Press US|year=2009|isbn=0-19-538786-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; English traveler John Morritt introduced this term into the English literature at the end of the 18th century, and other authors started applying the name to the wider area between the Adriatic and the Black Sea. The concept of the “Balkan peninsula” was created by the German geographer August Zeune in 1808.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pavic|first=Silvia|url=http://geography.about.com/library/misc/ucbalkans.htm|title=Some Thoughts About The Balkans.|publisher=About, Inc.|date=2000-11-22|accessdate=2008-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As time passed, the term gradually obtained political connotations far from its initial geographic meaning, arising from political changes from the late 19th century to the creation of post–[[World War I]] [[Yugoslavia]] (initially the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]]). Zeune's goal was to have a geographical parallel term to the [[Italian peninsula|Italic]] and [[Iberian Peninsula]], and seemingly nothing more. The gradually acquired political connotations are newer, and, to a large extent, due to oscillating political circumstances.

The term Balkans is generally used to describe areas that remained under Turkish rule after 1699, namely: [[Bulgaria]], [[Serbia]] (except for [[Vojvodina]]), [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], [[Thrace]], [[Albania]], [[Valahia]], [[Moldavia]], [[Epirus (region)|Epirus]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Montenegro]] (except for the Boka Bay and Budva), [[central Greece]] and the [[Peloponnese]]. [[Vojvodina]] and [[Transylvania]], it is argued, do not belong to Balkans. After the split of [[Yugoslavia]] beginning in June 1991, the term 'Balkans' again received a negative meaning, even in casual usage (see [[Balkanization]]). Over the last decade, in the wake of the former Yugoslav split, many [[Slovenians]] and [[Croatians]], as well as [[Serbs of Vojvodina]] have attempted to reject their label as 'Balkan nations'.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lindstrom&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lindstrom|first=Nicole|year=2003|title=Between Europe and the Balkans: Mapping Slovenia and Croatia's 'Return to Europe' in the 1990s|journal=Dialectical Anthropology|volume=27|issue=3–4|pages=313–329|doi=10.1023/B:DIAL.0000006189.45297.9e}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Western Balkans.PNG|thumb|The Western Balkan states according to the European Union.]]
This is in part due to the pejorative connotation of the term 'Balkans' in the 1990s, and continuation of this meaning until now. Today, the term 'Southeast Europe' is preferred or, in the case of [[Slovenia]] and [[Croatia]], '[[Central Europe]]' and Greece has almost exclusively been regarded and referred to as a '[[Southern Europe]]an' country.

===Southeastern Europe===
Because of the negative connotations of the term &quot;Balkan&quot;, the use of the term '''[[Southeastern Europe]]''' has become increasingly popular even though it refers to a much larger area and thus isn't as precise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A history of Eastern Europe |last=Bideleux |first=Robert |authorlink= |coauthors=Ian Jeffries |year=2007 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |location= |isbn=978-0-415-36627-4 |page=37 |pages= |url=http://books.google.com/?id=PTB0gn_qwTcC&amp;printsec=frontcover }}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[European Union]] initiative of 1999 is called the ''[[Stability Pact for South Eastern Europe]]'', and the online newspaper ''Balkan Times'' renamed itself ''[[Southeast European Times]]'' in 2003.

===Western Balkans===
[[European Union]] institutions and member states define the &quot;Western Balkans&quot; as Albania and the former Yugoslavia, minus Slovenia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/enlargement/pdf/balkans_communication/western_balkans_communication_050308_en.pdf|title=Western Balkans: Enhancing the European Perspective|publisher=Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council|date=2008-03-05|accessdate=2008-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European Bank for Reconstruction and Development]] uses &quot;Western Balkans&quot; to refer to the above states, minus Croatia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ebrd.com/new/stories/2006/060521a.htm|title=Western Balkans Initiative launched|author=Marjola Xhunga|publisher=European Bank for Reconstruction and Development|date=2006-05-21|accessdate=2008-05-17 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080616200335/http://www.ebrd.com/new/stories/2006/060521a.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today Western Balkans is more of a political than geographic definition for the region of Southeast Europe that is not yet in the European Union.

==Nature and natural resources==
[[File:Centralbalkan.jpg|thumb|The [[Balkan Mountains]] also known as &quot;Old mountain&quot; is a mountain range in the eastern part of the Balkan Peninsula in [[Bulgaria]] and [[Serbia]] ]]
Most of the area is covered by mountain ranges running from north-west to south-east. The main ranges are the [[Dinaric Alps]] in Slovenia, Croatia and Bosnia, the [[Šar Mountains|Šar]] massif which spreads from Albania to Macedonia and the [[Pindus]] range, spanning from southern Albania into central Greece. In Bulgaria there are ranges running from east to west: the [[Balkan mountains]] and the [[Rhodope mountains]] at the border with Greece. The highest mountain of the region is [[Rila]] in [[Bulgaria]], with [[Musala]] at 2925 m, with [[Mount Olympus (Mountain)|Mount Olympus]] in Greece, the throne of Zeus, being second at 2919 m and [[Vihren]] in Bulgaria being the third at 2914 m. The karst field or [[polje]] is a common feature of the landscape.

On the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] and [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] coasts the climate is [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean]], on the [[Black Sea]] coast the climate is [[Humid subtropical climate|humid subtropical]] and [[Oceanic climate|oceanic]], and in the inland it is moderate [[continental climate|continental]]. In the northern part of the peninsula and on the mountains, winters are frosty and snowy, while summers are hot and dry. In the southern part winters are milder.

During the centuries many woods have been cut down and replaced with bush. In the southern part and on the coast there is evergreen vegetation. In the inland there are woods typical of [[Central Europe]] ([[oak]] and [[beech]], and in the mountains, [[spruce]], [[fir]] and [[pine]]). The [[tree line]] in the mountains lies at the height of 1800–2300 m. The landscape provides [[habitats]] for numerous endemic species, including extraordinarily abundant [[insects]] and [[reptiles]] that serve as food for a variety of [[birds of prey]] and rare [[vultures]].

The soils are generally poor, except on the plains where are as with natural grass, fertile soils and warm summers provide an opportunity for tillage. Elsewhere, land cultivation is mostly unsuccessful because of the mountains, hot summers and poor soils, although certain cultures such as [[olive]]s and [[grape]]s flourish.

Resources of energy are scarce, except in the territory of Kosovo, where considerable coal, lead, zinc, chromium, silver deposits are located.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/country_profiles/3524092.stm |title=Regions and territories: Kosovo |publisher=BBC News |date=2009-11-20 |accessdate=2010-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other deposits of [[coal]], especially in Romania, Bulgaria, Serbia and Bosnia also exist. [[Lignite]] deposits are widespread in Greece. [[Petroleum]] is most notably present in Romania, although scarce reserves exist in Greece, Serbia, Albania and Croatia. [[Natural gas]] deposits are scarce. Hydropower is in wide use, with over 1,000 dams. The often relentless [[bora wind]] is also being harnessed for power generation.

Metal ores are more usual than other raw materials. Iron ore is rare but in some countries there is a considerable amount of [[copper]], [[zinc]], [[tin]], [[chromite]], [[manganese]], [[magnesite]] and [[bauxite]]. Some metals are exported.

==History and geopolitical significance==
[[File:Balkans Animation 1800-2006.gif|thumb|250|Political history of the Balkans]]
[[File:Stielers Handatlas 1891 50.jpg|thumb|The Balkans at the end of the 19th century]]
{{Main|History of the Balkans}}
The Balkan region was the first area of Europe to experience the arrival of [[farming]] cultures in the [[Neolithic]] era. The practices of growing grain and raising livestock arrived in the Balkans from the [[Fertile Crescent]] by way of [[Anatolia]], and spread west and north into [[Pannonia]] and [[Central Europe]].

The identity of the Balkans is dominated by its geographical position; historically the area was known as a crossroads of various cultures. It has been a juncture between the [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] bodies of the [[Roman Empire]], the destination of a massive influx of pagan [[Slavs]], an area where [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] and [[Catholic]] Christianity met, as well as the meeting point between [[Islam]] and [[Christianity]].

In pre-classical and [[classical antiquity]], this region was home to [[Greeks]], [[Illyrians]], [[Paeonians]], [[Thracians]], [[Dacians]] and other ancient groups. Later the [[Roman Empire]] conquered most of the region and spread Roman culture and the [[Latin]] language but significant parts still remained under [[Ancient Greece|classical Greek]] influence. The [[Southern Slavs|Slavs]] arrived in the 6th century and began assimilating and displacing the older inhabitants of the northern and central Balkans.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;''[http://books.google.com/books?id=f1F39vRlERAC&amp;pg=PA125&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Twenty Years of Balkan Tangle]''&quot;. Mary Edith Durham (2007). p.125. ISBN	1434634264&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Middle Ages]], the Balkans became the stage for a series of wars between the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]], [[History of Bulgaria|Bulgarian]] and [[Serbian Empire|Serbian]] Empires.

By the end of the 16th century, the [[Ottoman Empire]] had become the controlling force in the region after expanding from [[Anatolia]] through [[Thrace]] to the Balkans. Many people in the Balkans and [[Carpathians]] place their greatest folk heroes in the era of either the onslaught or the retreat of the Ottoman Empire. As examples, for [[Croats]], [[Nikola Šubić Zrinski]] and [[Petar Kružić]]; for Greeks [[Constantine XI Palaiologos]] and [[Kolokotronis]] for [[Serbs]], [[Miloš Obilić]] and [[Lazar Hrebeljanović|Tzar Lazar]]; for [[Albanians]], [[Gjergj Kastrioti Skanderbeg]]; for [[ethnic Macedonians]], [[Nikola Karev]];&lt;ref&gt;Considered a Bulgarian in Bulgaria&lt;/ref&gt; for [[Bosniaks]], [[Husein Gradaščević]]; and for [[Bulgarians]], [[Vasil Levski]], [[Georgi Sava Rakovski]] and [[Hristo Botev]]. 

In the past several centuries, because of the frequent [[Ottoman wars in Europe]] fought in and around the Balkans, and the comparative Ottoman isolation from the mainstream of economic advance (reflecting the shift of Europe's commercial and political centre of gravity towards the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]]), the Balkans has been the least developed part of Europe. According to Suraiya Faroqhi and Donald Quataert, &quot;The population of the Balkans, according to one estimate, fell from a high of 8 millions in the late 16th century to only 3 million by the mid-eighteenth. This estimate is in harmony with the first findings based on Ottoman documentary evidence.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;''[http://books.google.com/books?id=c00jmTrjzAoC&amp;pg=PA652&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false An economic and social history of the Ottoman Empire]''&quot;.

[[File:Mostar Old Town Panorama.jpg|220px|thumb|In the late 16th century, [[Mostar]] in Bosnia-Herzegovina was the chief administrative city for the Ottoman Empire in the Herzegovina region.]]
Most of the Balkan nation-sates emerged during the 19th and early 20th centuries as they gained independence either from the Ottoman Empire or the Austro-Hungarian empire. Serbia in 1817, Greece in 1829, Bulgaria and Montenegro in 1878,Romania 1878, Albania in 1912, Croatia and Slovania 1918.

=== 20th century ===
[[File:Sarajevoview.PNG|220px|thumb|[[Sarajevo]], the capital of Bosnia-Herzegovina.]]
In 1912–1913 the [[First Balkan War]] broke out when the nation-states of Greece,Serbia,Bulgaria and Montenegro united in an [[Balkan League|alliance]] against the Ottoman Empire and after a five months war essentially terminated five centuries of Ottoman' presence in Europe. Two months after the end of the war, a [[Second Balkan War]] broke out when Bulgaria dissatisfied from its share, attacked its allies Serbia and Greece. The Serbs and the Greeks repelled them and after the Greek army invaded Bulgaria following by a Romanian intervention, Bulgaria collapsed. The Ottoman empire used the opportunity to recapture [[Eastern Thrace]], establishing its new western borders that stand until today.

[[File:Tsarevets-gruev-1.JPG|220px|thumb|[[Veliko Tarnovo]] above the [[Yantra River]] is the former capital of the [[Second Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian Empire]].]]
The [[World War I|First World War]] was sparked in the Balkans in 1914 when a [[Black hand]] revolutionary organization with predominately Serbian and pro Yugoslav oriented members [[assassination in Sarajevo|assassinated]] in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]'s capital [[Sarajevo]] the Austro-Hungarian heir [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria]]. That caused a war between the two countries which -through the existing [[Allies of World War I|chains of alliances]]- led to the First World War. The Ottoman empire soon joined the [[Central powers]] becoming one of the three empires participating in that alliance. The next year Bulgaria joined the [[Central Powers]] attacking Serbia which was successfully fighting Austro-Hungary to the north for a year. That led to Serbia's defeat and the intervention of the [[Entente]] in the Balkans which sent an expeditionary force to establish a new [[Macedonian front|front]], the third one of that war, which soon became also static. The participation of Greece in the war three years later, in 1918, on the part of the Entente finally altered the balance between the opponents leading to the collapse of the common German-Bulgarian front there which caused the exit of Bulgaria from the war, and in turn the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire ending the First World War.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of World War I, Spencer Tucker,Priscilla Mary Roberts, p.242&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dubrovnik1.jpg|220px|thumb|The Old Harbour at [[Dubrovnik]]. Between the 14th century and 1808 the Republic of Ragusa ruled itself as a free state.]]
With the start of the [[Second World War]] all Balkan countries with the exception of Greece were allies of [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] having bilateral military agreements or being part of the [[Axis Pact]]. [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Fascist Italy]] expanded the war in Balkans by using its protectorate Albania to [[Greco-Italian War|invade Greece]]. After repelling the attack the Greeks counterattacked invading Italy held Albania causing a Nazi Germany's intervention in the Balkans in order to help its ally.&lt;ref&gt;Europe in Flames, J. Klam, 2002, p.41&lt;/ref&gt; Days before the German invasion a successful [[coup d'état]] in [[Belgrade]] by neutral military personnel sized the power.&lt;ref&gt;Russia's life-saver, Albert Loren Weeks, 2004, p.98&lt;/ref&gt; 

Although the new government reaffirmed Serbia's intentions to fulfil its obligations as member of the Axis,&lt;ref&gt;Germany and the 2nd World War Volume III:The Mediterranean, south-east Europe, and north Africa, 1939-1941, Gerhard Schreiber,Bernd Stegemann,Detlef Vogel, 1995, p.484&lt;/ref&gt; Germany using its other two allied countries on the region, Bulgaria and Romania, invaded both Greece and Yugoslavia. Yugoslavia immediately disintegrated when the loyal to the Serbian King and the Croatian units, mutinied.&lt;ref&gt;Germany and the 2nd World War Volume III:The Mediterranean, south-east Europe, and north Africa, 1939-1941, Gerhard Schreiber,Bernd Stegemann,Detlef Vogel, 1995, p.521&lt;/ref&gt; Greece resisted, but after two months fighting collapsed and occupied. The two countries partitioned between the three Axis allies, Bulgaria, Germany, and Italy, and two independent states, [[Croatia]] and [[Montenegro]] created.

During the occupation the population suffered considerable hardship due to [[ethnic cleansing|ethnic cleansing policies]], repression and starvation on which the population reacted by creating a mass resistance movement.&lt;ref&gt;Inside Hitler's Greece:The Experience of Occupation, Mark Mazower, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; Together with the early and extremely heavy winter of that year (which caused hundreds of thousands deaths among the poorly fed population), the German invasion had disastrous effects in the timetable of the [[Operation Barbarossa|planned invasion in Russia]] causing a significant delay&lt;ref&gt;Hermann Goring: Hitler's Second-In-Command, Fred Ramen, 2002, p.61&lt;/ref&gt; which had key consequences to the route of the war.&lt;ref&gt;The encyclopedia of codenames of World War II#Marita, Christopher Chant, 1986, p.125-6&lt;/ref&gt; 

Finally at the end of 1944, the Soviets invaded Romania and Bulgaria while the Germans evacuated the Balkans. They left behind an economically ransacked through exploitation and largely ruined region, but by making use of the post-war separation of Germany into two independent entities, the German states succeeded to avoid legally, paying any reparations or repaying the forced taken loans to the occupied countries. The official Yugoslav post-war estimate of [[World War II casualties|victims]] in Yugoslavia during [[World War II]] is 1,704,000. Subsequent data gathering in the 1980s by historians [[Vladimir Žerjavić]] and [[Bogoljub Kočović]] showed that the actual number of dead was about 1 million. Greece suffered more than 300,000 casualties during the [[Axis occupation of Greece during World War II|occupation]].

==== Cold War ====
During the [[Cold War]], most of the countries on the Balkans were governed by communist governments. Greece became the first battleground of the emerging Cold War and finally remained the only non-Soviet country in the region, after having successfully dealt with a wild guerrilla war unleashed by the [[KKE|local communist party]] backed by the neighboring communist countries (Albania, Bulgaria and Yugoslavia) much in the same fashion as with [[Vietnam war|Vietnam]], causing a full scale [[Greek Civil War|civil war]] during 1944-49.

However, despite being under communist governments, [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] (1948) and [[Albania]] (1961) fell out with the Soviet Union. Yugoslavia, led by marshal [[Josip Broz Tito]] (1892–1980), first propped up then rejected the idea of merging with [[Bulgaria]], and instead sought closer relations with the [[Western World|West]], later even spearheaded, together with India and Egypt the [[Non-Aligned Movement]]. Albania on the other hand gravitated toward [[People's Republic of China|Communist China]], later adopting an [[isolationism|isolationist]] position.

As the only non-communist countries, [[Greece]] and [[Turkey]] were (and still are) part of [[NATO]] consisting the South-eastern wing of the alliance.

====Post–Cold War ====
In the 1990s, the region was gravely affected by the [[Yugoslav wars|wars between the former Yugoslav republics]] broken out after Serbia's attempt to change the status of equality between the Yugoslav federated Republics to proportionate status. Other Republics didn't agree to the proposed change as unconstitutional and when Serbia tried to enforce it abandoned the federation. Serbia in turn declared the dissolution of the union as unconstitutional and the [[Yugoslav People's Army|Yugoslavian army]] unsuccessfully tried to [[Croatian War of Independence|invade]] [[Croatia]] which together with [[Slovenia]] had declared independence. The Army eventually slowly withdrew from both nations by 1992 and in Croatia the war between the Croatian government and local Serbs would continue until 1995. In the ensuing 10 years armed confrontation, gradually all the other Republics declared independence. The long lasting wars resulted in a [[United Nations]] intervention and [[NATO intervention in Bosnia|NATO]] ground and air forces took action against Serb forces in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and Serbia (including its southern province of [[Kosovo]]).

[[File:Skadarlija Blgrade 2.jpg|220px|thumb|[[Skadarlija]], the old [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] neighbourhood, [[Belgrade]], the capital of Serbia]]

From the dissolution of Yugoslavia six republics achieved international recognition as sovereign republics: [[Slovenia]], [[Croatia]], [[Bosnia]], [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], [[Montenegro]] and [[Serbia]]. The Albanian institutions in [[Kosovo]], currently under UN administration, declared independence in 2008 (according to the official Serbian policy, Kosovo is still an internal autonomous region). In July 2010, the [[International Court of Justice]], after a [[UN General Assembly]]'s request, opined that, since there is not an active rule in [[international law]] limiting the declarations of independence, the unilateral kosovar proclamation does not violate it (leaving unanswered the questions about the consequences of said act, including whether with said declaration Kosovo achieved the status of a State). The international community is still divided on the matter and while the majority of the UN members do not recognize it as independent, most [[NATO]] and [[EU]] countries do. After the end of the wars a [[October revolution|revolution]] broke in Belgrade and [[Slobodan Milošević]], the Serbian communist leader (elected president between 1989–2000), was overthrown and handed for trial to the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia|International Criminal Tribunal]] for crimes against the [[International Humanitarian Law]] during the Yugoslav wars. Ιn 2001 an Albanian uprising in [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]] forced the country to give local autonomy to the [[Albanians in Macedonia|ethnic Albanians]] in the areas where they predominate.

With the dissolution of [[Yugoslavia]] an issue emerged over the name under which the former (federated) republic of Macedonia would internationally be recognized, between the new country and Greece. Being the [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonian part of Yugoslavia]] (see [[Vardar Macedonia]]), the federated Republic under the Yugoslav identity had the name [[Socialist Republic of Macedonia|Republic of Macedonia]] on which it declared its sovereignty in 1991. Greece, having a large region (see [[Macedonia (Greece)]]) also under the same name opposed to the usage of this name as an indication of a nationality. The [[Macedonia naming dispute|issue]] is currently under (prolonged) negotiations after a UN initiation.

[[File:Ohridpanorama.jpg|220px|thumb|The city of [[Ohrid]] in [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], sometimes referred as the Slavic Jerusalem, because of the many churches in its vicinity.]]

Balkan countries control the direct [[European route|land routes]] between [[Western Europe]] and South West [[Asia]] ([[Asia Minor]] and the [[Middle East]]). Since 2000, all Balkan countries are friendly towards the [[European Union|EU]] and the [[United States|USA]].

[[Greece]] has been a member of the [[European Union]] since 1981; [[Slovenia]] and [[Cyprus]] since 2004. [[Bulgaria]] and [[Romania]] joined in 2007. In 2005, the European Union decided to start accession negotiations with candidate countries; [[Croatia]], [[Turkey]], and [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]] were accepted as candidates for European Union membership. As of April 2009,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/news_52902.htm Ceremony marks the accession of Albania and Croatia to NATO], NATO - News, 7 April 2009. Retrieved 2009-04-18.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Albania]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Croatia]], [[Romania]] and [[Slovenia]] are also members of [[NATO]]. [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and what was then [[Serbia and Montenegro]] started negotiations with the EU over the Stabilization and Accession Agreements, although shortly after they started, negotiations with Serbia and Montenegro were suspended for lack of co-operation with the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia]]. In [[2008 Bucharest summit|2008]] Greece vetoed Macedonia's Nato membership bid over the [[Macedonia naming dispute]] between the two countries.

All other countries have expressed a desire to join the EU but at some date in the future.

The Balkans today is a very diverse ethno-linguistic region, being home to multiple [[Slavic languages|Slavic]], [[Romance languages|Romance]], and [[Turkic languages]], as well as [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Albanian language|Albanian]] and others. Through its history many other ethnic groups with their own languages lived in the area, among them [[Thracians]], [[Illyrians]], [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], [[Pechenegs]], [[Cumans]], [[Eurasian Avars|Avars]], [[Celts]] and various [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribes]].

===Jewish communities of the Balkans===
[[File:Sarajevo Synagogue 02.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Sarajevo Synagogue]].]]
[[File:Sarajevo Haggadah.jpg|thumb|right|Copies of the [[Sarajevo Haggadah]] in the [[Parliament of Bosnia and Herzegovina|parliament building of Bosnia and Herzegovina]].]]

The Jewish communities of the Balkans were some of the oldest in Europe and date back to ancient times. The Jewish communities of the Balkans were [[Sephardi]] Jews, except in [[Slovenia]], [[Croatia]] and [[Romania]] where the Jewish communities were [[Ashkenazi]] Jews. [[Jews in Slovenia|In Slovenia]], there were Jewish immigrants dating back to Roman times pre-dating the 6th century settlement of the region by the Slavic peoples.&lt;ref&gt;Jews of Yugoslavia 1941–1945 Victims of Genocide and Freedom Fighters, Jasa Romano&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], the tiny and fast disappearing Jewish community is 90% [[Sephardic]] and [[Judeo-Spanish|Ladino]] is still spoken among the elderly. The Sephardi Jewish cemetery in [[Sarajevo]] has tombstones of a unique shape, inscribed in ancient Ladino.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurojewcong.org/ejc/news.php?id_article=59 European Jewish Congress - Bosnia-Herzegovina], Accessed July 15, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Sephardi Jews used to have a large presence in the city of [[Thessaloniki]], and by 1900, some 80,000, or more than half of the population, were Jews.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Greece.html Greece]&quot;. [[Jewish Virtual Library]].&lt;/ref&gt; 

However the Jewish communities in the Balkans suffered immensely during [[World War II]] and the vast majority were killed during the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]]. However an exception were the [[Bulgarian Jews]] many of whom were saved by [[Boris III of Bulgaria]], who resisted [[Adolf Hitler]] for their deportation to [[concentration camps]]. Almost all of the few survivors have emigrated to the (then) newly founded state of [[Israel]] and elsewhere. No Balkan country today has a significant Jewish minority.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The orbits in which the electron may travel are shown as grey circles; their radius increases as ''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''n'' is the [[principal quantum number]].  The {{nowrap|3 &amp;rarr; 2}} transition depicted here produces the first line of the [[Balmer series]], and for hydrogen ({{nowrap|''Z'' {{=}} 1}}) it results in a photon of [[wavelength]] 656 [[nano-metre|nm]] (red light).]]&lt;/small&gt;

In [[atomic physics]], the '''Bohr model''', devised by [[Niels Bohr]], depicts the [[atom]] as a small, positively charged [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]] surrounded by [[electron]]s that travel in circular orbits around the nucleus&amp;mdash;similar in structure to the [[solar system]], but with [[electrostatic force]]s providing attraction, rather than [[gravity]]. This was an improvement on the earlier [[cubic atoms|cubic model]] (1902), the [[plum-pudding model]] (1900), the [[Saturnian model]] (1904), and the [[Rutherford model]] (1911). Since the Bohr model is a quantum physics-based modification of the Rutherford model, many sources combine the two, referring to the '''Rutherford–Bohr model'''.

Introduced by [[Niels Bohr]] in 1913, the model's key success lay in explaining the [[Rydberg formula]] for the spectral [[hydrogen spectral series|emission lines]] of atomic [[hydrogen]]. While the Rydberg formula had been known experimentally, it did not gain a theoretical underpinning until the Bohr model was introduced. Not only did the Bohr model explain the reason for the structure of the Rydberg formula, it also provided a justification for its empirical results in terms of fundamental physical constants.

The Bohr model is a primitive model of the hydrogen atom. As a theory, it can be derived as a first-order approximation of the hydrogen atom using the broader and much more accurate [[quantum mechanics]], and thus may be considered to be an [[obsolete scientific theory]]. However, because of its simplicity, and its correct results for selected systems (see below for application), the Bohr model is still commonly taught to introduce students to quantum mechanics, before moving on to the more accurate but more complex [[atomic orbitals|valence shell atom]].  A related model was originally proposed by [[Arthur Erich Haas]] in 1910, but was rejected. The quantum theory of the period between [[Planck#Black-body radiation|Planck's discovery of the quantum]] (1900) and the advent of a full-blown [[quantum mechanics]] (1925) is often referred to as the [[old quantum theory]].

==Origin==
 
In the early 20th century, experiments by [[Ernest Rutherford]] established that [[atom]]s consisted of a diffuse cloud of negatively charged [[electron]]s surrounding a small, dense, positively charged nucleus. Given this experimental data, Rutherford naturally considered a planetary-model atom, the [[Rutherford model]] of 1911 – electrons orbiting a solar nucleus – however, said planetary-model atom has a technical difficulty. The laws of classical mechanics (i.e. the [[Larmor formula]]), predict that the electron will release [[electromagnetic radiation]] while orbiting a nucleus. Because the electron would lose energy, it would gradually spiral inwards, collapsing into the nucleus. This atom model is disastrous, because it predicts that all atoms are unstable.

Also, as the electron spirals inward, the emission would gradually increase in frequency as the orbit got smaller and faster. This would produce a continuous smear, in frequency, of electromagnetic radiation. However, late 19th century experiments with [[electric discharge]]s through various low-pressure [[gas]]es in evacuated glass tubes had shown that atoms will only emit light (that is, electromagnetic radiation) at certain discrete frequencies.

To overcome this difficulty, [[Niels Bohr]] proposed, in 1913, what is now called the ''Bohr model of the atom''. He suggested that electrons could only have certain ''classical'' motions:
# The electrons can only travel in certain orbits: at a certain discrete set of distances from the nucleus with specific energies.
# The electrons of an atom revolve around the nucleus in orbits. These orbits are associated with definite energies and are also called energy shells or energy levels. Thus, the electrons do not continuously lose energy as they travel in a particular orbit. They can only gain and lose energy by jumping from one allowed orbit to another, absorbing or emitting electromagnetic radiation with a frequency ''ν'' determined by the energy difference of the [[Bohr model#Electron energy levels|levels]] according to the ''Planck relation'':&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;\Delta{E} = E_2-E_1=h\nu \ ,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; where ''h'' is [[Planck's constant]].
# The frequency of the radiation emitted at an orbit of period ''T'' is as it would be in classical mechanics; it is the reciprocal of the classical orbit period:&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt; \nu = {1\over T}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The significance of the Bohr model is that the laws of classical mechanics apply to the motion of the electron about the nucleus ''only when restricted by a quantum rule''. Although rule 3 is not completely well defined for small orbits, because the emission process involves two orbits with two different periods, Bohr could determine the energy spacing between levels using rule 3 and come to an exactly correct quantum rule: the angular momentum ''L'' is restricted to be an integer multiple of a fixed unit:
:&lt;math&gt; L = n{h \over 2\pi} = n\hbar&lt;/math&gt;

where ''n'' = 1, 2, 3, ... is called the [[principal quantum number]], and ''ħ'' = ''h''/2π. The lowest value of ''n'' is 1; this gives a smallest possible orbital radius of 0.0529&amp;nbsp;nm known as the [[Bohr radius]]. Once an electron is in this lowest orbit, it can get no closer to the proton. Starting from the angular momentum quantum rule Bohr&lt;ref&gt;N. Bohr, ''Philosophical Magazine'' '''26''', 1-25 (1913) (a link to this article is provided below)&lt;/ref&gt; was able to calculate the [[Bohr model#Electron energy levels|energies of the allowed orbits]] of the hydrogen atom and other [[Bohr model#Shell model of the atom|hydrogen-like]] atoms and ions.

Other points are:
# Like Einstein's theory of the [[Photoelectric effect]], Bohr's formula assumes that during a quantum jump a ''discrete'' amount of energy is radiated. However, unlike Einstein, Bohr stuck to the ''classical'' [[Maxwell's equations|Maxwell theory]] of the electromagnetic field. Quantization of the electromagnetic field was explained by the discreteness of the atomic [[Bohr model#Electron energy levels|energy levels]]; Bohr did not believe in the existence of [[photon]]s.
# According to the Maxwell theory the frequency ''ν'' of classical radiation is equal to the rotation frequency ''ν''&lt;sub&gt;rot&lt;/sup&gt; of the electron in its orbit, with [[harmonics]] at integer multiples of this frequency. This result is obtained from the Bohr model for jumps between energy levels ''E''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''E''&lt;sub&gt;''n''−''k''&lt;/sub&gt; when ''k'' is much smaller than ''n''. These jumps reproduce the frequency of the ''k''-th harmonic of orbit ''n''. For sufficiently large values of ''n'' (so-called [[Rydberg state]]s), the two orbits involved in the emission process have nearly the same rotation frequency, so that the classical orbital frequency is not ambiguous. But for small ''n'' (or large ''k''), the radiation frequency has no unambiguous classical interpretation. This marks the birth of the [[correspondence principle]], requiring quantum theory to agree with the classical theory only in the limit of large quantum numbers.
# The [[BKS theory|Bohr-Kramers-Slater theory]] (BKS theory) is a failed attempt to extend the Bohr model which violates the conservation of [[Conservation of energy|energy]] and [[Conservation of linear momentum|momentum]] in quantum jumps, with the conservation laws only holding on average.

Bohr's condition, that the angular momentum is an integer multiple of ''ħ'' was later reinterpreted by [[de Broglie]] as a [[standing wave]] condition: the electron is described by a wave and a whole number of wavelengths must fit along the circumference of the electron's orbit:
:&lt;math&gt;n \lambda = 2 \pi r\,&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting de Broglie's wavelength reproduces Bohr's rule. Bohr justified his rule by appealing to the correspondence principle, without providing a wave interpretation.

In 1925 a new kind of mechanics was proposed, [[quantum mechanics]] in which Bohr's model of electrons traveling in quantized orbits was extended into a [[matrix mechanics|more accurate model]] of electron motion. The new theory was proposed by [[Werner Heisenberg]]. [[Schrödinger equation|Another form]] of the same theory, modern quantum mechanics, was discovered by the Austrian physicist [[Erwin Schrödinger]] independently and by different reasoning.

== Electron energy levels ==

The Bohr model gives almost exact results only for a system where two charged points orbit each other at speeds much less than that of light. This not only includes one-electron systems such as the [[hydrogen atom]], singly ionized [[helium]], doubly ionized [[lithium]], but it includes [[positronium]] and [[Rydberg states]] of any atom where one electron is far away from everything else. It can be used for [[K-line (spectrometry)|K-line]] X-ray transition calculations if other assumptions are added (see [[#Moseley's law and calculation of K-alpha X-ray emission lines|Moseley's law]] below). In high energy physics,
it can be used to calculate the masses of [[quark|heavy quark]] [[meson]]s.

To calculate the orbits requires two assumptions:

*Classical mechanics
:The electron is held in a circular orbit by electrostatic attraction. The [[centripetal force]] is equal to the [[Coulomb law|Coulomb force]].
::&lt;math&gt; {m_e v^2\over r} = {Zk_e e^2 \over r^2} &lt;/math&gt;
:where ''m''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; is the mass, ''e'' is the charge of the [[electron]] and ''k''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; is [[Coulomb's constant]]. This determines the speed at any radius:
:: &lt;math&gt; v = \sqrt{ Zk_e e^2 \over m_e r} &lt;/math&gt;

: It also determines the total energy at any radius:
:: &lt;math&gt; E= {1\over 2} m_e v^2 - {k_e e^2 \over r} = - { k_e e^2 \over 2r}  &lt;/math&gt;

:The total energy is negative and inversely proportional to ''r''. This means that it takes energy to pull the orbiting electron away from the proton. For infinite values of ''r'', the energy is zero, corresponding to a motionless electron infinitely far from the proton. The total energy is half the [[potential energy]], which is true for non circular orbits too by the [[virial theorem]].

:For larger nuclei, the only change is that ''k''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;''e''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is everywhere replaced by ''Zk''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;''e''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; where ''Z'' is the number of protons. For [[positronium]], ''m''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; is replaced by its [[reduced mass]] ({{nowrap|''&amp;mu;'' {{=}} ''m''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;/2}}).

*Quantum rule

:The [[angular momentum]] {{nowrap|''L'' {{=}} ''m''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;''vr''}} is an integer multiple of ''ħ'':
::&lt;math&gt; m_e v r = n \hbar &lt;/math&gt;

:Substituting the expression for the velocity gives an equation for ''r'' in terms of n:
::&lt;math&gt; \sqrt{Zk_e e^2 m_e r} = n \hbar &lt;/math&gt;
:so that the allowed orbit radius at any n is:
::&lt;math&gt; r_n = {n^2\hbar^2\over Zk_e e^2 m_e} &lt;/math&gt;

:The smallest possible value of ''r'' in the hydrogen atom is called the [[Bohr radius]] and is equal to:
:: &lt;math&gt;r_1 = {\hbar^2 \over k_e e^2 m_e} \approx 5.29 \times 10^{-11} \mathrm{m} &lt;/math&gt;

:The energy of the ''n''-th level for any atom is determined by the radius and quantum number:
::&lt;math&gt; E = -{Zk_e e^2 \over 2r_n } = - { Z^2(k_e e^2)^2 m_e \over 2\hbar^2 n^2} \approx {-13.6Z^2 \over n^2}\mathrm{eV} &lt;/math&gt;

An electron in the lowest energy level of hydrogen ({{nowrap|''n'' {{=}} 1}}) therefore has about 13.6&amp;nbsp;[[electronvolt|eV]] less energy than a motionless electron infinitely far from the nucleus.  The next energy level ({{nowrap|''n'' {{=}} 2}})  is −3.4&amp;nbsp;eV.  The third (''n'' = 3) is −1.51&amp;nbsp;eV, and so on. For larger values of ''n'', these are also the binding energies of a highly excited atom with one electron in a large circular orbit around the rest of the atom.

The combination of natural constants in the energy formula is called the Rydberg energy (''R''&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;):
:&lt;math&gt; R_E = { (k_e e^2)^2 m_e \over 2 \hbar^2} &lt;/math&gt;

This expression is clarified by interpreting it in combinations which form more [[natural units]]:
: &lt;math&gt;\, m_e c^2 &lt;/math&gt; is the [[rest mass energy]] of the electron (511 keV)
: &lt;math&gt;\, {k_e e^2 \over \hbar c} = \alpha \approx {1\over 137} &lt;/math&gt; is the [[fine structure constant]]
: &lt;math&gt;\, R_E = {1\over 2} (m_e c^2) \alpha^2&lt;/math&gt;

Since this derivation is with the assumption that the nucleus is orbited by one electron, we can generalize this result by letting the nucleus have a charge ''q'' = ''Z e'' where ''Z'' is the [[atomic number]]. This will now give us energy levels for hydrogenic atoms, which can serve as a rough order-of-magnitude approximation of the actual energy levels. So, for nuclei with ''Z'' protons, the energy levels are (to a rough approximation):
:&lt;math&gt; E_n = -{Z^2 R_E \over n^2} &lt;/math&gt;

The actual energy levels cannot be solved analytically for more than one electron (see [[n-body problem]]) because the electrons are not only affected by the [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]] but also interact with each other via the [[Coulomb Force]]. 

When ''Z'' = 1/''α'' (Z ≈ 137), the motion becomes highly relativistic, and ''Z''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; cancels the ''α''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in ''R''; the orbit energy begins to be comparable to rest energy. Sufficiently large nuclei, if they were stable, would reduce their charge by creating a bound electron from the vacuum, ejecting the positron to infinity. This is the theoretical phenomenon of electromagnetic charge screening which predicts a maximum nuclear charge. Emission of such positrons has been observed in the collisions of heavy ions to create temporary super-heavy nuclei.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}

For positronium, the formula uses the [[reduced mass]]. For any value of the radius, the electron and the positron are each moving at half the speed around their common center of mass, and each has only one fourth the kinetic energy. The total kinetic energy is half what it would be for a single electron moving around a heavy nucleus.
:&lt;math&gt; E_n = {R_E \over 2 n^2 }  &lt;/math&gt; (positronium)

==Rydberg formula==
The [[Rydberg formula]], which was known empirically before Bohr's formula, is now in Bohr's theory seen as describing the energies of transitions or [[Atomic electron transition|quantum jumps]] between one orbital energy level, and another. [[Bohr model#History|Bohr's formula]] gives the numerical value of the already-known and measured [[Rydberg's constant]], but now in terms of more fundamental constants of nature, including the electron's charge and [[Planck's constant]].

When the electron gets moved from its original energy level to a higher one, it then jumps back each level till it comes to the original position, which results in a [[photon]] being emitted. Using the derived formula for the different 'energy' levels of hydrogen one may determine the 'wavelengths' of light that a hydrogen atom can emit.

The energy of a photon emitted by a hydrogen atom is given by the difference of two hydrogen energy levels:
::&lt;math&gt;E=E_i-E_f=R_E \left( \frac{1}{n_{f}^2} - \frac{1}{n_{i}^2} \right) \,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt; is the final energy level, and ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is the initial energy level.

Since the energy of a [[photon]] is 

::&lt;math&gt;E=\frac{hc}{\lambda}, \,&lt;/math&gt;

the wavelength of the photon given off is given by

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\lambda}=R \left( \frac{1}{n_{f}^2} - \frac{1}{n_{i}^2} \right). \,&lt;/math&gt;

This is known as the [[Rydberg formula]], and the Rydberg constant R is &lt;math&gt;R_E/hc&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;R_E/2\pi&lt;/math&gt; in [[natural units]].  This formula was known in the nineteenth century to scientists studying [[spectroscopy]], but there was no theoretical explanation for this form or a theoretical prediction for the value of R, until Bohr. In fact, Bohr's derivation of the Rydberg constant, as well as the concomitant agreement of [[Bohr model#History|Bohr's formula]] with experimentally observed spectral lines of the [[Lyman series|Lyman]] (&lt;math&gt;n_f = 1&lt;/math&gt;), [[Balmer series|Balmer]] (&lt;math&gt;n_f = 2&lt;/math&gt;), and [[Paschen series|Paschen]] (&lt;math&gt;n_f = 3&lt;/math&gt;) series, and successful theoretical prediction of other lines not yet observed, was one reason that his model was immediately accepted.

To apply to atoms with more than one electron, the Rydberg formula can be modified by replacing &quot;Z&quot; with &quot;Z - b&quot; or &quot;n&quot; with &quot;n - b&quot; where b is constant representing a screening effect due to the inner-shell  and other electrons (see [[Electron shell]] and the later discussion of the &quot;Shell Model of the Atom&quot; below). This was established empirically before Bohr presented his model.

== Shell model of the atom ==

Bohr extended the model of Hydrogen to give an approximate model for heavier atoms. This gave a physical picture which reproduced many known atomic properties for the first time.

Heavier atoms have more protons in the nucleus, and more electrons to cancel the charge. Bohr's idea was that each discrete orbit could only hold a certain number of electrons. After that orbit is full, the next level would have to be used. This gives the atom a [[electron configuration|shell structure]], in which each shell corresponds to a Bohr orbit.

This model is even more approximate than the model of hydrogen, because it treats the electrons in each shell as non-interacting. But the repulsions of electrons are taken into account somewhat by the phenomenon of [[Shielding effect|screening]]. The electrons in outer orbits do not only orbit the nucleus, but they also orbit the inner electrons, so the effective charge Z that they feel is reduced by the number of the electrons in the inner orbit.

For example, the lithium atom has two electrons in the lowest 1S orbit, and these orbit at Z=2. Each one sees the nuclear charge of Z=3 minus the screening effect of the other, which crudely reduces the nuclear charge by 1 unit. This means that the innermost electrons orbit at approximately 1/4 the Bohr radius. The outermost electron in lithium orbits at roughly Z=1, since the two inner electrons reduce the nuclear charge by 2. This outer electron should be at nearly one Bohr radius from the nucleus. Because the electrons strongly repel each other, the effective charge description is very approximate; the effective charge Z doesn't usually come out to be an integer. But [[Moseley's law]] experimentally probes the innermost pair of electrons, and shows that they do see a nuclear charge of approximately Z-1, while the outermost electron in an atom or ion with only one electron in the outermost shell orbits a core with effective charge Z-k where k is the total number of electrons in the inner shells.

The shell model was able to qualitatively explain many of the mysterious properties of atoms which became codified in the late 19th century in the [[periodic table of the elements]]. One property was the size of atoms, which could be determined approximately by measuring the [[viscosity]] of gases and density of pure crystalline solids. Atoms tend to get smaller toward the right in the periodic table, and become much larger at the next line of the table. Atoms to the right of the table tend to gain electrons, while atoms to the left tend to lose them. Every element on the last column of the table is chemically inert ([[noble gas]]).

In the shell model, this phenomenon is explained by shell-filling. Successive atoms become smaller because they are filling orbits of the same size, until the orbit is full, at which point the next atom in the table has a loosely bound outer electron, causing it to expand. The first Bohr orbit is filled when it has two electrons, and this explains why helium is inert. The second orbit allows eight electrons, and when it is full the atom is neon, again inert. The third orbital contains eight again, except that in the more correct Sommerfeld treatment (reproduced in modern quantum mechanics) there are extra &quot;d&quot; electrons. The third orbit may hold an extra 10 d electrons, but these positions are not filled until a few more orbitals from the next level are filled (filling the n=3 d orbitals produces the 10 [[transition elements]]). The irregular filling pattern is an effect of interactions between electrons, which are not taken into account in either the Bohr or Sommerfeld models, and which are difficult to calculate even in the modern treatment.

== Moseley's law and calculation of K-alpha X-ray emission lines ==
Niels Bohr said in 1962, &quot;You see actually the Rutherford work [the nuclear atom] was not taken seriously. We cannot understand today, but it was not taken seriously at all. There was no mention of it any place. The great change came from Moseley.&quot;

In 1913 [[Henry Moseley]] found an empirical relationship between the strongest X-ray line emitted by atoms under electron bombardment (then known as the [[K-alpha]] line), and their atomic number Z. Moseley's empiric formula was found to be derivable from Rydberg and Bohr's formula (Moseley actually mentions only [[Ernest Rutherford]] and [[Antonius Van den Broek]] in terms of models). The two additional assumptions that '''[1]''' this X-ray line came from a transition between energy levels with quantum numbers 1 and 2, and '''[2]''', that the atomic number Z when used in the formula for atoms heavier than hydrogen, should be diminished by 1, to (Z-1)².

Moseley wrote to Bohr, puzzled about his results, but Bohr was not able to help. At that time, he thought that the postulated innermost &quot;K&quot; shell of electrons should have at least four electrons, not the two which would have neatly explained the result. So Moseley published his results without a theoretical explanation. 

Later, people realized that the effect was caused by charge screening, with an inner shell containing only 2 electrons. In the experiment, one of the innermost electrons in the atom is knocked out, leaving a vacancy in the lowest Bohr orbit, which contains a single remaining electron. This vacancy is then filled by an electron from the next orbit, which has n=2. But the n=2 electrons see an effective charge of Z-1, which is the value appropriate for the charge of the nucleus, when a single electron remains in the lowest Bohr orbit to screen the nuclear charge +Z, and lower it by -1 (due to the electron's negative charge screening the nuclear positive charge). The energy gained by an electron dropping from the second shell to the first gives [[Moseley's law]] for K-alpha lines:

::&lt;math&gt;E= h\nu = E_i-E_f=R_E (Z-1)^2 \left( \frac{1}{1^2} - \frac{1}{2^2} \right) \,&lt;/math&gt;

or

::&lt;math&gt;f = \nu = R_v \left( \frac{3}{4}\right) (Z-1)^2 = (2.46 \times 10^{15} \operatorname{Hz})(Z-1)^2.&lt;/math&gt;

Here, '''R&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;''' = '''R&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;/h''' is the Rydberg constant, in terms of frequency equal to 3.28 x 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; Hz. For values of Z between 11 and 31 this latter relationship had been empirically derived by Moseley, in a simple (linear) plot of the square root of X-ray frequency against atomic number (however, for silver, Z = 47, the experimentally obtained screening term should be replaced by 0.4). Notwithstanding its restricted validity&lt;ref&gt;M.A.B. Whitaker, ''Europ. J. Phys.'' '''20''', 213-220 (1999).&lt;/ref&gt; did Moseley's law not only establish the objective meaning of atomic number (see [[Henry Moseley]] for detail) but, as Bohr noted, it also did more than the Rydberg derivation to establish the validity of the Rutherford/Van den Broek/Bohr nuclear model of the atom, with atomic number as nuclear charge.

The [[K-alpha]] line of Moseley's time is now known to be a pair of close lines, written as ('''K&lt;sub&gt;α1&lt;/sub&gt;''' and '''K&lt;sub&gt;α2&lt;/sub&gt;''') in [[Siegbahn notation]].

==Shortcomings==
The Bohr model gives an incorrect value &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \mathbf{L} = \hbar  &lt;/math&gt; for the ground state orbital angular momentum.  The angular momentum in the true ground state is known to be zero. Although mental pictures fail somewhat at these levels of scale, an electron in the lowest modern &quot;orbital&quot; with no orbital momentum, may be thought of as not to rotate &quot;around&quot; the nucleus at all, but merely to go tightly around it in an ellipse with zero area (this may be pictured as &quot;back and forth&quot;, without striking or interacting with the nucleus). This is only reproduced in a more sophisticated semiclassical treatment like Sommerfeld's. Still, even the most sophisticated semiclassical model fails to explain the fact that the lowest energy state is spherically symmetric--- it doesn't point in any particular direction.

In modern quantum mechanics, the electron in hydrogen is a [[electron cloud|spherical cloud of probability]] which grows denser near the nucleus. The rate-constant of probability-decay in hydrogen is equal to the inverse of the Bohr radius, but since Bohr worked with circular orbits, not zero area ellipses, the fact that these two numbers exactly agree, is considered a &quot;coincidence.&quot; (Though many such coincidental agreements are found between the semi-classical vs. full quantum mechanical treatment of the atom; these include identical energy levels in the hydrogen atom, and the derivation of a [[fine structure constant]], which arises from the relativistic Bohr-Sommerfeld model (see below), and which happens to be equal to an entirely different concept, in full modern quantum mechanics).

The Bohr model also has difficulty with, or else fails to explain:

* Much of the spectra of larger atoms. At best, it can make predictions about the [[K-alpha]] and some L-alpha X-ray emission spectra for larger atoms, if ''two'' additional ad hoc assumptions are made (see [[Moseley's law]] above). Emission spectra for atoms with a single outer-shell electron (atoms in the [[lithium]] group) can also be approximately predicted. Also, if the empiric electron-nuclear screening factors for many atoms are known, many other spectral lines can be deduced from the information, in similar atoms of differing elements, via the Ritz-Rydberg combination principles (see [[Rydberg formula]]). All these techniques essentially make use of Bohr's Newtonian energy-potential picture of the atom.
* The theory does not predict the relative intensities of spectral lines; although in some simple cases, Bohr's formula or modifications of it, was able to provide reasonable estimates (for example, calculations by Kramers for the [[Stark effect]]).
* The existence of [[fine structure]] and [[hyperfine structure]] in spectral lines, which are known to be due to a variety of relativistic and subtle effects, as well as complications from electron spin.
* The [[Zeeman effect]] - changes in spectral lines due to external [[magnetic field]]s; these are also due to more complicated quantum principles interacting with electron spin and orbital magnetic fields.
* The model also violates the [[uncertainty principle]] in that it considers electrons to have known orbits and definite radius, two things which can not be directly known at once.

==Refinements==
{{Merge|Bohr–Sommerfeld theory| discuss=Talk:Bohr_model#merge_suggestion:_Refinements_and_Bohr.E2.80.93Sommerfeld_theory|date=March 2009}}
[[Image:Sommerfeld ellipses.svg|thumb|Elliptical orbits with the same energy and quantized angular momentum]]
Several enhancements to the Bohr model were proposed; most notably the '''[[Old quantum theory|Sommerfeld model]]''' or '''[[Bohr–Sommerfeld theory|Bohr-Sommerfeld model]]''', which suggested that electrons travel in elliptical orbits around a nucleus instead of the  Bohr model's circular orbits.&lt;ref name=&quot;Akhlesh Lakhtakia Ed. 1996&quot;/&gt; This model supplemented the quantized angular momentum condition of the Bohr model with an additional radial quantization condition, the '''Sommerfeld-Wilson quantization condition'''&lt;ref&gt;[[Arnold Sommerfeld|A. Sommerfeld]]. ''Zur Quantentheorie der Spektrallinien''. [[Annalen der Physik|Ann. d. Phys.]] 51, 1 (1916)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Willian Wilson|W. Wilson]]. ''The quantum theory of radiation and line spectra''. [[Philosophical Magazine|Phil. Mag.]] 29: 795–802 (1915).&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\int_0^T p_r \,dq_r = n h
\,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''p&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the radial momentum canonically conjugate to the coordinate ''q'' which is the radial position and ''T'' is one full orbital period. The integral is the [[action (physics)|action]] of [[action-angle coordinates]]. This condition, suggested by the [[correspondence principle]], is the only one possible, since the quantum numbers are [[adiabatic invariant]]s.

The Bohr-Sommerfeld model was fundamentally inconsistent and led to many paradoxes. The [[magnetic quantum number]] measured the tilt of the orbital plane relative to the ''xy''-plane, and it could only take a few discrete values. This contradicted the obvious fact that an atom could be turned this way and that relative to the coordinates without restriction. The Sommerfeld quantization can be performed in different canonical coordinates, and sometimes gives answers which are different. The incorporation of radiation corrections was difficult, because it required finding action-angle coordinates for a combined radiation/atom system, which is difficult when the radiation is allowed to escape. The whole theory did not extend to non-integrable motions, which meant that many systems could not be treated even in principle.  In the end, the model was replaced by the modern [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] treatment of the [[hydrogen atom]], which was first given by [[Wolfgang Pauli]] in 1925, using [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg]]'s [[matrix mechanics]]. The current picture of the hydrogen atom is based on the [[atomic orbitals]] of [[Schrödinger equation|wave mechanics]] which [[Erwin Schrödinger]] developed in 1926.

However, this is not to say that the Bohr model was without its successes. Calculations based on the Bohr-Sommerfeld model were able to accurately explain a number of more complex atomic spectral effects. For example, up to first-order [[perturbation theory|perturbations]], the Bohr model and quantum mechanics make the same predictions for the spectral line splitting in the [[Stark effect]]. At higher-order perturbations, however, the Bohr model and quantum mechanics differ, and measurements of the Stark effect under high field strengths helped confirm the correctness of quantum mechanics over the Bohr model.  The prevailing theory behind this difference lies in the shapes of the orbitals of the electrons, which vary according to the energy state of the electron.

The Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization conditions lead to questions in modern mathematics. Consistent semiclassical quantization condition requires a certain type of structure on the phase space, which places topological limitations on the types of symplectic manifolds which can be quantized. In particular, the symplectic form should be the [[curvature form]] of a [[connection (mathematics)|connection]] of a [[Charles Hermite|Hermitian]] [[line bundle]], which is called a  [[geometric quantization|prequantization]].

'''Bombay Sapphire''' is a brand of [[gin]] distributed by [[Bacardi]], launched in 1987, having been named via a competitive process whereby a number of leading Madison Avenue agencies were played off against each other.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} The name hints at the origins of the gin's popularity in the [[Indian subcontinent|India]] of the days of the [[British Raj]] and the sapphire in question is the [[Star of Bombay]] on display at the [[Smithsonian Institution]] &lt;ref&gt;http://www.bacardilimited.com/brands_bombay.html&lt;/ref&gt; Bombay Sapphire is marketed in a flat-sided, sapphire-coloured bottle that bears a likeness of [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] on the label.

The flavouring of the drink comes from a recipe of ten ingredients (which the bottle's label boasts as &quot;10 exotic botanicals&quot;): [[almond]], [[lemon]] peel, [[liquorice]], [[juniper berries]], [[orris root]], [[angelica]], [[coriander]], [[Cinnamomum aromaticum|cassia]], [[cubeb]], and [[Aframomum melegueta|grains of paradise]]. The spirit is triple distilled using a carterhead still, and the alcohol vapours are passed through a mesh/basket containing the ten botanicals, in order to gain flavour and aroma. This gives a lighter, more floral gin rather than the more-common 'punchy' gins that are distilled using a copper [[pot still]]. Water from [[Lake Vyrnwy]] is added to bring the strength of Bombay Sapphire down to 40.0% (UK).

==Design connection==
The brand started a series of [[design]] collaborations. Their first step into the design world was a series of advertisements featuring work from currently popular designers. Their works, varying from [[Martini (cocktail)|martini]] glasses to tiles and cloth patterns, are labelled as “Inspired by Bombay Sapphire”. The campaign featured designers such as [[Marcel Wanders]], [[Yves Behar]], [[Karim Rashid]], [[Ulla Darni]], and [[Dror Benshetrit]] and performance artist Jurgen Hahn.

From the success of this campaign, the company started a series of events and sponsored locations. The best known is the Bombay Sapphire Designer Glass Competition, held each year, where design students from all over the world can participate by designing their own “inspired” martini cocktail glass. The finalists (one from each participating country) are then invited to the yearly Salone del Mobile, an international design fair in Milano, where the winner is chosen.

Bombay Sapphire also endorses glass artists and designers with the Bombay Sapphire Prize, which is awarded every year to an outstanding design which features glass. Bombay Sapphire also showcases the designers' work in the Bombay Sapphire endorsed blue room, which is actually a design exhibition touring the world each year.

From 2008 the Bombay Sapphire Designer Glass Competition final will be held at 100% Design in London, UK and the Bombay Sapphire Prize will take place in Milan at the Salone Del Mobile.

'''James Robert Wills''' (March 6, 1905 &amp;ndash; May 13, 1975), better known as '''Bob Wills''', was an [[United States|American]] [[Western swing]] musician, [[songwriter]], and bandleader, considered by many music authorities one of the fathers of Western swing&lt;ref name=&quot;WSJ&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123430049028669793.html|title=The Tiffany Transcriptions, Back and Better|last=Mazor|first=Barry|date=MUSICFEBRUARY 11, 2009|accessdate=13 January 2010|work=The Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wolff, ''Country Music'', &quot;Big Balls in Cowtown: Western Swing From Fort Worth to Fresno&quot;, p. 29: If any single person deserves to be considered the 'father' of western swing, it must be Bob Wills.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;West, &quot;Trails and Footprints&quot;, p. 39: &quot;Snyder [Texas] hosts the West Texas Western Swing Festival ('Come Fiddle Around in Snyder'), recognizing the regional origins of the father of western swing, Bob Wills, from Turkey (a bit more than a hundred miles due north in Hall County) ...&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; and called the King of Western Swing by his fans.

Bob Wills' name will forever be associated with Western swing. Although he did not invent the genre single-handedly (he and his old Fort Worth friend, [[Milton Brown]], co-created Western Swing), Wills truly popularized the genre and changed its rules. In the process, he reinvented the rules of popular music. Bob Wills and His Texas Playboys were a dance band with a country string section that played pop songs as if they were jazz numbers. Their music expanded and erased boundaries between genres. It was also some of the most popular music of its era. Throughout the '40s, the band was one of the most popular groups in the country and the musicians in the Playboys were among the finest of their era. As the popularity of Western swing declined, so did Wills' popularity, but his influence is immeasurable. From the first honky tonkers to Western swing revivalists, generations of country artists owe him a significant debt, as do certain rock and jazz musicians. Wills was a maverick and his spirit infused American popular music of the 20th century with a renegade, virtuosic flair. 

Wills was born outside of [[Kosse, Texas]], in 1905. From his father and grandfather, he learned how to play mandolin, guitar, and eventually fiddle, and he regularly played local dances in his teens. In 1929, he joined a medicine show in [[Fort Worth]], where he played fiddle and did blackface comedy. At one performance, he met guitarist Herman Arnspiger and the duo formed the Wills Fiddle Band. Within a year, they were playing dances and radio stations around Fort Worth. During one of the performances, the pair met a vocalist called Milton Brown, who joined the band. Soon, Brown's guitarist brother Derwood joined the group, as did Clifton &quot;Sleepy&quot; Johnson, a tenor banjo player. 

In early 1931, the band landed their own radio show, which was sponsored by the Burris Mill and Elevator Company, the manufacturers of Light Crust Flour. The group rechristened themselves the [[Light Crust Doughboys]] and their show was being broadcast throughout Texas, hosted and organized by [[W. Lee O'Daniel]], the manager of Burris Mill. By 1932, the band was stars in Texas but there was some trouble behind the scenes; O'Daniel wasn't allowing the band to play anything but the radio show. This situation led to the departure of Brown; Wills eventually replaced Brown with vocalist [[Tommy Duncan]], who he would work with for the next 16 years. By late summer 1933, Wills, aggravated by a series of fights with O'Daniel, left the Light Crust Doughboys and Duncan left with him. 

Wills and Duncan relocated to [[Waco, Texas]], and formed the Playboys, which featured Wills on fiddle, Duncan on piano and vocals, rhythm guitarist June Whalin, tenor banjoist Johnnie Lee Wills, and Kermit Whalin, who played steel guitar and bass. For the next year, the Playboys moved through a number of radio stations, as O'Daniel tried to force them off the air. Finally, the group settled in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]], where they had a job at KVOO. 

Tulsa is where Wills and His Texas Playboys began to refine their sound. Wills added an 18-year-old electric steel guitarist called [[Leon McAuliffe]], pianist Al Stricklin, drummer Smokey Dacus, and a horn section to the band's lineup. Soon, the Texas Playboys were the most popular band in Oklahoma and Texas. The band made their first record in 1935 for the American Recording Company, which would later become part of [[Columbia Records]]. At ARC, they were produced by Uncle Art Satherley, who would wind up as Wills' producer for the next 12 years. The bandleader had his way and they cut a number of tracks that were released on a series of 78s. The singles were successful enough that Wills could demand that McAuliffe -- who wasn't on the first sessions due to ARC's abundance of steel players under contract -- was featured on the Playboys' next record, 1936's &quot;Steel Guitar Rag.&quot; The song became a standard for steel guitar. Also released from that session was &quot;Right or Wrong,&quot; which featured Duncan on lead vocals. 

Toward the end of the decade, big bands were dominating popular music and Wills wanted a band capable of playing complex, jazz-inspired arrangements. To help him achieve his sound, he hired arranger and guitarist [[Eldon Shamblin]], who wrote charts that fused country with big band music for the Texas Playboys. By 1940, he had replaced some of the weaker musicians in the lineup, winding up with a full 18-piece band. The Texas Playboys were breaking concert attendance records across the country, filling out venues from Tulsa to California, and they also had their first genuine national hit with &quot;[[New San Antonio Rose]]&quot;, which climbed to number 11 in 1940. Throughout 1941 and 1942, Wills and His Texas Playboys continued to record and perform and they were one of the most popular bands in the country. However, their popularity was quickly derailed by the arrival of [[World War II]]. Duncan enlisted in the Army after [[Pearl Harbor]] and Stricklin became a defense plant worker. Late in 1942, McAuliffe and Shamblin both left the group. Wills enlisted in the Army late in 1942, but he was discharged as being unfit for service in the summer of 1943, primarily because he was out of shape and disagreeable. Duncan was discharged around the same time and the pair moved to California by the end of 1943. Wills revamped the sound of the Texas Playboys after World War II, cutting out the horn section and relying on amplified string instruments. 

During the '40s, Art Satherley had moved from ARC to OKeh Records and Wills followed him to the new label. His first single for OKeh was a new version of &quot;New San Antonio Rose&quot; and it became a Top Ten hit early in 1944, crossing over into the Top 20 on the pop charts. Wills stayed with OKeh for about year, having several Top Ten hits, as well as the number ones &quot;Smoke on the Water&quot; and &quot;Stars and Stripes on Iwo Jima.&quot; After he left OKeh, he signed with Columbia Records, releasing his first single for the label, &quot;Texas Playboy Rag,&quot; toward the end of 1945. 

In 1946, the Texas Playboys began recording a series of transcriptions for [[Oakland, CA]]'s Tiffany Music Corporation. Tiffany's plan was to syndicate the transcriptions throughout the Southwest, but their goal was never fulfilled. Nevertheless, the Texas Playboys made a number of transcriptions in 1946 and 1947, and these are the only recordings of the band playing extended jams. Consequently, they are close approximations of the group's live sound. Though the Tiffany transcriptions would turn out to be important historical items, the recordings that kept Wills and His Texas Playboys in the charts were their singles for Columbia, which were consistently reaching the Top Five between 1945 and 1948; in the summer of 1946, they had their biggest hit, &quot;New Spanish Two Step,&quot; which spent 16 weeks at number one. 

Guitarist Eldon Shamblin returned to the Playboys in 1947, the final year Wills recorded for Columbia Records. Beginning in late 1947, Wills was signed to MGM. His first single for the label, &quot;Bubbles in My Beer,&quot; was a Top Ten hit early in 1948, as was its follow-up, &quot;Keeper of My Heart.&quot; Though the Texas Playboys were one of the most popular bands in the nation, they were beginning to fight internally, mainly because Wills had developed a drinking problem that caused him to behave erratically. Furthermore, Wills came to believe Duncan was demanding too much attention and asking for too much money. By the end of 1948, he had fired the singer. 

Duncan's departure couldn't have come at a worse time. Western swing was beginning to fall out of public favor, and Wills' recordings weren't as consistently successful as they had been before; he had no hits at all in 1949. That year, he relocated to Oklahoma, beginning a 15-year stretch of frequent moves, all designed to find a thriving market for the band. In 1950, he had two Top Ten hits, &quot;Ida Red Likes the Boogie&quot; and &quot;Faded Love,&quot; which would become a country standard; they would be his last hits for a decade. Throughout the '50s, he struggled with poor health and poor finances, but he continued to perform frequently. However, his audience continued to shrink, despite his attempts to hold on to it. Wills moved throughout the Southwest during the decade, without ever finding a new home base. Audiences at dance halls plummeted with the advent of television and rock &amp; roll. The Texas Playboys made some records for Decca that went unnoticed in the mid-'50s. In 1959, Wills signed with Liberty Records, where he was produced by Tommy Allsup, a former Playboy. Before recording his first sessions with Liberty, Wills expanded the lineup of the band again and reunited with Duncan. The results were a success, with &quot;Heart to Heart Talk&quot; climbing into the Top Ten during the summer of 1960. Again, the Texas Playboys were drawing sizable crowds and selling a respectable amount of records. 

In 1962, Wills had a heart attack that temporarily debilitated him, but by 1963 he was making an album for Kapp Records. The following year, he had a second heart attack, which forced him to disband the Playboys. After the second heart attack, he performed and recorded as a solo performer. His solo recordings for Kapp were made in Nashville with studio musicians and were generally ignored, though he continued to be successful in concert. 

In 1968, the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]] inducted Wills and the following year the [[Texas State Legislature]] honored him for his contribution to American music. The day after he appeared in both houses of the Texas state government, Wills suffered a massive stroke that paralyzed his right side. During his recovery, [[Merle Haggard]] -- the most popular country singer of the late '60s -- recorded an album dedicated to Wills, A Tribute to the Best Damn Fiddle Player, which helped return Wills to public consciousness and spark a widespread Western swing revival. In 1972, Wills was well enough to accept a citation from ASCAP in Nashville, as well as appear at several Texas Playboy reunions, which were all very popular. In the fall of 1973, Wills and Haggard began planning a Texas Playboys reunion album, featuring McAuliffe, Stricklin, Shamblin, and Dacus, among others. The first session was held on December 3, 1973, with Wills leading the band from his wheelchair. That night, he suffered another massive stroke in his sleep; the stroke left him comatose. The Texas Playboys finished the album without him. Wills never regained consciousness and died in a nursing home on May 15, 1975 in Fort Worth, the city where his iconic music career first began. He was buried in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
==Biography==
===Early years===
He was born on a farm near [[Kosse, Texas]],&lt;ref&gt;San Antonio Rose - The Life and Music of Bob Wills. Charles R. Townsend. 1976. University of Illinois. p. 1. ISBN 0-252-00470-1.&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Limestone County, Texas|Limestone County]] near [[Groesbeck, Texas|Groesbeck]], to Emma Lee Foley and John Tompkins Wills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wargs.com/other/wills.html |title=Ancestry of Bob Wills |publisher=Wargs.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father was a statewide champion [[Musical styles (violin)#Fiddle|fiddle]] player&lt;ref&gt;Milton Brown and the Founding of Western Swing. Cary Ginell. 1994. University of Illinois Press. ISBN 0-252-02041-3.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Wills family was either playing music, or someone was &quot;always wanting us to play for them,&quot; in addition to raising cotton on their farm.

In addition to picking cotton, the young Jim Bob learned to play the fiddle and the [[mandolin]]. Both a sister and several brothers played musical instruments, while another sister played piano. The Wills family frequently held country dances in their home, and there was dancing in all four rooms While living in [[Hall County, Texas]],they also played at 'ranch dances' which were popular in both West Texas and eastern New Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;San Antonio Rose - The Life and Music of Bob Wills. Charles R. Townsend. 1976. University of Illinois. p. 17. ISBN 0-252-00470-1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wills not only learned traditional music from his family, he learned some Negro songs directly from African Americans in the cotton fields near Lakeview, Texas and said that he did not play with many white children other than his siblings, until he was seven or eight years old. African Americans were his playmates, and his father enjoyed watching him jig dance with black children.&lt;ref&gt;San Antonio Rose - The Life and Music of Bob Wills. Charles R. Townsend. 1976. University of Illinois. p. 4. ISBN 0-252-00470-1.&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;I don't know whether they made them up as they moved down the cotton rows or not,&quot; Wills once told Charles Townsend, author of ''San Antonio Rose: The Life and Times of Bob Wills'', &quot;but they sang blues you never heard before.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;shgrar&quot;&gt;

===New Mexico and Texas===

The family moved to [[Hall County, Texas|Hall County]] in the [[Texas Panhandle]] in 1913,&lt;ref&gt;San Antonio Rose - The Life and Music of Bob Wills. Charles R. Townsend. 1976. University of Illinois. p. 3. ISBN 0-252-00470-1.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1919 they bought a farm between the towns of [[Lakeview, Texas|Lakeview]] and [[Turkey, Texas|Turkey]].&lt;ref&gt;San Antonio Rose - The Life and Music of Bob Wills. Charles R. Townsend. 1976. University of Illinois. p. 16. ISBN 0-252-00470-1.&lt;/ref&gt;  At the age of 16 Wills left the family and hopped a freight train. &quot;Jim Rob&quot;, as he became known, drifted for several years, traveling from town to town to try and earn a living, at one point almost losing his life when he nearly fell from a moving train, and later being chased by railroad police.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hubbin 1995. pages 76, 80&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;San Antonio Rose - The Life and Music of Bob Wills. Charles R. Townsend. 1976. University of Illinois. pages 14, 21, 22. ISBN 0-252-00470-1&lt;/ref&gt; In his 20s he attended barber school, got married, and moved first to [[Roy, New Mexico]] then returned to Turkey in Hall County (now considered his home town) to work as a barber at Hamm's Barber Shop. He alternated barbering and fiddling even when he moved to [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]] after leaving Hall County in 1929. There he played in [[minstrel show|minstrel]] and [[medicine show]]s, and, as with other Texas musicians such as Ocie Stockard, continued to earn money as a barber. He wore [[blackface]] makeup to appear in comedy routines, something that was common at the time. &quot;He was playing his violin and singing.&quot; There were two guitars and a banjo player with him. &quot;Bob was in blackface and was the comic; he cracked jokes, sang, and did an amazing jig dance.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bob Wills 1976. page 45&quot;&gt;San Antonio Rose - The Life and Music of Bob Wills. Charles R. Townsend. 1976. University of Illinois. p. 45. ISBN 0-252-00470-1.&lt;/ref&gt; Since there was already a &quot;Jim&quot; on the show, the manager began calling him &quot;Bob.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bob Wills 1976. page 45&quot;/&gt; However, it was as &quot;Jim Rob Wills&quot;, paired with Herman Arnspiger, that he made his first commercial (though unissued) recordings in November 1929 for Brunswick/Vocalion.&lt;ref&gt;Country Music Records - A Discography, 1921-1942. Tony Russell. 2008. Oxford University Press. p. 960. ISBN 978-0-19-536621-1&lt;/ref&gt;

Wills was known for his hollering and wisecracking. One source for this was when, as a very young boy, he would hear his father, grandfather, and cowboys give out loud cries when the music moved them.&lt;ref&gt;San Antonio Rose - The Life and Music of Bob Wills. Charles R. Townsend. 1976. University of Illinois. p. 107. ISBN 0-252-00470-1.&lt;/ref&gt; When asked if his wisecracking and talking on the bandstand came from his medicine show experience, he said it did not. Rather, he said that it came directly from playing and living close to Negroes, and that he never did it necessarily as show, but more as a way to express his feelings.&lt;ref&gt;San Antonio Rose - The Life and Music of Bob Wills. Charles R. Townsend. 1976. University of Illinois. p. 46. ISBN 0-252-00470-1.&lt;/ref&gt;

While in Fort Worth, Wills added the &quot;rowdy city blues&quot; of [[Bessie Smith]] and [[Emmett Miller]] to a repertoire of mainly waltzes and breakdowns he had learned from his father, and patterned his vocal style after that of Miller and other performers such as [[Al Bernard]].&lt;ref&gt;Milton Brown and the Founding of Western Swing. Cary Ginell. 1994. University of Illinois Press. pp. 32,33. ISBN 0-252-02041-3.&lt;/ref&gt; Wills acknowledged that he idolized Miller. Furthermore, his 1935 version of &quot;[[St. Louis Blues (song)|St. Louis Blues]]&quot; is nearly a word-for-word copy of Al Bernard's patter on his 1928 recording of the same song.&lt;ref&gt;Milton Brown and the Founding of Western Swing. Cary Ginell. 1994. University of Illinois Press. pp. 245, 246. ISBN 0-252-02041-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The fact that Wills made his professional debut in blackface was commented on by Wills' daughter, Rosetta: &quot;He had a lot of respect for the musicians and music of his black friends,&quot; Rosetta is quoted as saying on the Bob Wills and the Texas Playboys Web site. She remembers that her father was such a fan of [[Bessie Smith]], &quot;he once rode 50 miles on horseback just to see her perform live.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;shgrar&quot;/&gt; (Wills is quoted as saying, &quot;I rode horeseback from the place between the rivers to Childress to see Bessie Smith...She was about the greatest thing I had ever heard. In fact, there was no doubt about it. She ''was'' the greatest thing I ever heard.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;San Antonio Rose - The Life and Music of Bob Wills. Charles R. Townsend. 1976. University of Illinois. p. 40. ISBN 0-252-00470-1.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Fort Worth, Wills met Herman Arnspinger and formed The Wills Fiddle Band. In [[1930 in country music|1930]] [[Milton Brown]] joined the group as lead vocalist and brought a sense of innovation and experimentation to the band, now called the [[Light Crust Doughboys]] due to radio sponsorship by the makers of Light Crust Flour. Brown left the band in [[1932 in country music|1932]] to form the Musical Brownies, the first true [[Western swing]] band. Brown added twin fiddles, tenor [[banjo]] and slap bass, pointing the music in the direction of swing, which they played on local [[radio]] and at [[dancehalls]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web

 |accessdate=2 May 2010
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wills remained with the Doughboys and replaced Brown with new singer [[Tommy Duncan]] in 1932. He found himself unable to get along with future Texas Governor [[W. Lee &quot;Pappy&quot; O'Daniel]], the authoritarian host of the Light Crust Doughboy radio show. O'Daniel had parlayed the show's popularity into growing power within Light Crust Flour's parent company, Burrus Mill and Elevator Company and wound up as General Manager, though he despised what he considered &quot;hillbilly music.&quot; Wills and Duncan left the Doughboys in [[1933 in country music|1933]] after Wills had missed one show too many due to his sporadic drinking.

Wills recalled the early days of what became known as Western swing music in a 1949 interview.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=A. Schneider |url=http://www.npr.org/programs/morning/features/2003/honkytonks/ |title=Honky Tonks, Hymns and the Blues |publisher=NPR |date= |accessdate=2010-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Here's the way I figure it. We sure not tryin' to take credit for swingin' it.&quot; Speaking of Milt Brown and himself working with songs done by [[Jimmie Davis]], the Skillet Lickers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Billy Abbott |url=http://www.southernmusic.net/gidtanner.htm |title=Gid Tanner And The Skillet Lickers |publisher=Southernmusic.net |date=1924-03-07 |accessdate=2010-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]], and others, and songs he'd learned from his father, he said that &quot;We'd pull these tunes down an set 'em in a dance category. It wouldn't be a runaway, and just lay a real nice beat behind it an the people would get to really like it. It was nobody intended to start anything in the world. We was just tryin' to find enough tunes to keep 'em dancin' to not have to repeat so much.&quot;

Wills is also quoted as saying, &quot;You can change the name of an old song, rearrange it and make it a swing. &quot;One Star Rag&quot;, &quot;Rat Cheese under the Hill&quot;, &quot;[[Take Me Back to Tulsa]]&quot;, &quot;[[Basin Street Blues]]&quot;, &quot;[[Steel Guitar Rag]]&quot;, and &quot;[[Trouble in Mind (song)|Trouble in Mind]]&quot; were some of the songs in his extensive repertory.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Dance Across Texas. by Betty Casey. 1985. University of Texas Press. p. 43. ISBN 0-292-71551-X.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Texas Playboys===

After forming a new band, The Playboys, and relocating to [[Waco, Texas|Waco]], Wills found enough popularity there to decide on a bigger market. They left Waco in January of [[1934 in country music|1934]] for [[Oklahoma City]]. Wills soon settled the renamed Texas Playboys in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]], and began broadcasting noontime shows over the 50,000 watt [[KFAQ|KVOO]] [[radio station]]. Their 12:30-1:15 p.m. Monday&amp;ndash;Friday broadcasts became a veritable institution in the region.
Nearly all of the daily (except Sunday) shows originated from the stage of [[Cain's Ballroom]]. In addition, they played dances in the evenings, including regular ones at the ballroom on Thursdays and Saturdays.

Wills added a trumpet to the band inadvertently when he hired Everet Stover as an announcer, not knowing that he had played with the New Orleans symphony and had directed the governor's band in Austin. Stover, thinking he had been hired as a trumpeter began playing with the band with no comment from Wills. Young sax player Zeb McNally was allowed to play with the band, although Wills initially discouraged it. With two horns in the band Wills realized he would have to add a drummer to balance things and create a fuller sound. He hired the young, &quot;modern style musician&quot; Smokey Ducas.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hubbin 1995. pages 76, 80&quot;&gt;Hubbin' It. Ruth Sheldon. 1995. Country Music Foundation Press. first published 1938. pages 76, 80, 81. ISBN 0-915608-18-9.&lt;/ref&gt;
By [[1935 in country music|1935]] Wills had added [[horn section|horn]], [[reed (instrument)|reed]] players and [[drummer|drums]] to the Playboys. The addition of [[steel guitar]] whiz [[Leon McAuliffe]] in March, 1935 added not only a formidable instrumentalist but a second engaging vocalist. Wills himself largely sang [[blues]] and sentimental [[ballads]].

With its [[jazz]] sophistication, pop music and [[blues]] influence, plus improvised [[scats]] and wisecrack commentary by Wills, the band became the first [[superstar]]s of the genre. Milton Brown's tragic and untimely death in 1936 had cleared the way for the Playboys.

Session rosters from 1938 show both &quot;lead guitar&quot; and &quot;electric guitar&quot; in addition to guitar and steel guitar in the Texas Playboys recordings.&lt;ref&gt;''San Antonio Rose - The Life and Music of Bob Wills''. Charles R. Townsend. 1976. University of Illinois. page 342, 343. ISBN 0-252-00470-1&lt;/ref&gt; Wills' 1938 recording of &quot;[[Ida Red]]&quot; served as a model for Chuck Berry's decades later version of the same song - &quot;[[Maybellene]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.famoustexans.com/bobwills.htm |title=Bob Wills |publisher=Famoustexans.com |date=1975-05-13 |accessdate=2010-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=July 13, 2006

About this time Wills purchased and performed with an old [[Giovanni Battista Guadagnini|Guadagnini]] violin that had once fetched $7,600 for $1,600, the equivalent of about $24,000 in 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hubbin 1995. pages 76, 80&quot;/&gt;

In 1940 &quot;[[New San Antonio Rose]]&quot; sold a million records and became the [[signature song]] of The Texas Playboys. The song's title referred to the fact that Wills had recorded it as a fiddle instrumental in [[1938 in country music|1938]] as &quot;San Antonio Rose&quot;. By then, the Texas Playboys were virtually two bands: one a fiddle-guitar-steel band with rhythm section and the second a first-rate [[big band]] able to play the day's [[swing (genre)|swing]] and [[pop music|pop]] hits as well as [[Dixieland]].

The &quot;front line&quot; of Wills' orchestra consisted of either fiddles or guitars after 1944.&lt;ref&gt;''San Antonio Rose - The Life and Music of Bob Wills''. Charles R. Townsend. 1976. University of Illinois. page 237. ISBN 0-252-00470-1&lt;/ref&gt;

===Film career===
In 1940 Wills, along with the Texas Playboys, co-starred with [[Tex Ritter]] in ''[[Take Me Back to Oklahoma]]''.&lt;ref&gt;*{{IMDb title|id=0033132|title=Take Me Back to Oklahoma}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other films would follow. In late 1942 after several band members had left the group, and as World War II raged, Wills joined the Army, but received a medical discharge in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Charles R. Townsend |url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/WW/fwi45.html |title=Handbook of Texas Online - WILLS, JAMES ROBERT |publisher=Tshaonline.org |date= |accessdate=2010-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bobwills.com/history.html |title=History |publisher=bobwills.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/wills_bob/bio.jhtml |title=Bob Wills : Biography |publisher=CMT.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wills also appeared in ''[[The Lone Prairie]]'' (1942), ''[[Riders of the Northwest Mounted]]'' (1943), ''[[Saddles and Sagebrush]]'' (1943), ''[[The Vigilantes Ride]]'' (1943), ''[[The Last Horseman]]'' (1944), ''[[Rhythm Round-Up]]'' (1945), ''[[Blazing the Western Trail]]'' (1945), and ''[[Lawless Empire]]'' (1945). According to one source, he appeared in a total of 19 films.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

===California===
After leaving the Army in 1943 Wills moved to Hollywood and began to reorganize the Texas Playboys. He became an enormous draw in Los Angeles, where many of his Texas, Oklahoma and regional fans had also relocated during the [[Great Depression]] and [[World War II]] in search of jobs. Monday through Friday the band broadcast from 12:01 to 1:00 p.m. over KMTR-AM (now KLAC) in LA. They also played regularly every Friday, Saturday, and Sunday night at the Mission Beach Ballroom in San Diego.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bob Wills 1976. page 241&quot;&gt;San Antonio Rose - The Life and Music of Bob Wills. Charles R. Townsend. 1976. University of Illinois. p. 241. ISBN 0-252-00470-1.&lt;/ref&gt;

He commanded enormous fees playing dances there, and began to make more creative use of [[electric guitar]]s to replace the big horn sections the Tulsa band had boasted. For a very brief period in 1944 the Wills band included 23 members.,&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt; and around mid year he toured Northern California and the Pacific Northwest with 21 pieces in the orchestra.&lt;ref&gt;San Antonio Rose - The Life and Music of Bob Wills. Charles R. Townsend. 1976. University of Illinois. p. 350. ISBN 0-252-00470-1.&lt;/ref&gt;
Billboard reported that Wills outgrossed Harry James, Benny Goodman, &quot;both Dorsies, et al.&quot; at Civic Auditorium in [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], [[California]], in January 1944.&lt;ref&gt;Billboard February 5, 1944. Vol. 56, No. 6. p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

While on his first cross-country tour, he appeared on the [[Grand Ole Opry]] and defied that conservative show's ban on using drums of any sort.

In 1945 Wills' dances were outdrawing those of [[Tommy Dorsey]] and [[Benny Goodman]],&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt; and he had moved to [[Fresno, California|Fresno]], California. Then in 1947 he opened the Wills Point nightclub in [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] and continued touring the Southwest and Pacific Northwest from Texas to Washington State. While based in Sacramento his radio broadcasts over 50,000 watt [[KFBK]] were heard all over the West.&lt;ref&gt;Workin' Man Blues - Country Music in California. Gerald W. Haslan. University of California Press. 1999. p. 82. ISBN 0-520-21800-0.&lt;/ref&gt;

Famous swing orchestras in California realized that many of their followers were leaving to dance to Bob Will's Western swing. Because he was in such demand, some places booked Wills any time he had an opening, regardless of how undesirable the date. The manager of a popular auditorium in the LA Basin town of Wilmington, California: &quot;Although Monday night dancing is frankly an experiment it was the only night of the week on which this outstanding band could be secured.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bob Wills 1976. page 241&quot;/&gt;

During the postwar period, [[KGO (AM)|KGO]] radio in [[San Francisco]] syndicated a Bob Wills and His Texas Playboys show recorded at the [[Fairmont Hotel]]. Many of these recordings survive today as the [[Tiffany Transcriptions]],&lt;ref name=&quot;WSJ&quot; /&gt; and are available on [[Compact disc|CD]]. They show off the band's strengths significantly, in part because the group was not confined to the three-minute limits of 78 RPM discs. They featured superb instrumental work from fiddlers Joe Holley and Louis Tierney, steel guitarists Noel Boggs and Herb Remington, guitarists [[Eldon Shamblin]] and [[Junior Barnard]] and electric mandolinist-fiddler [[Tiny Moore]]. The original recorded version of Wills' &quot;[[Faded Love]]&quot;, appeared on the Tiffanys as a fairly swinging instrumental unlike the ballad it became when lyrics were added in 1950.

Wills and the Texas Playboys played dances throughout the West to more than 10,000 people every week. They held dance attendance records at [[Jantzen Beach]] in Portland, Oregon; Santa Monica, California, and at the Oakland (California) Auditorium, where they drew 19,000 people in two nights.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bob Wills 1976. page 252&quot;&gt;San Antonio Rose - The Life and Music of Bob Wills. Charles R. Townsend. 1976. University of Illinois. p. 252. ISBN 0-252-00470-1.&lt;/ref&gt; Wills also broke an attendance record of 2,100 previously held by Jan Garbner at the Armory in Klamath Falls, Oregon, by attracting 2,514 dancers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bob Wills 1976. page 252&quot;/&gt;

Actor [[Clint Eastwood]] recalled seeing Wills when he was 18 or 19 (1948 or 1949) and working at a pulp mill in [[Springfield, Oregon|Springfield]], [[Oregon]].&lt;ref&gt;The King of Western Swing - Bob Wills Remembered. Rosetta Wills. 1998. p. 165. ISBN 0-8230-7744-6. The author has a magazine clipping, but doesn't specify the magazine or date.&lt;/ref&gt;

Appearances at the Bostonia Ballroom in San Diego continued throughout the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;www.sandiegoconcertarchive.com bob wills San Diego Concert Archive accessed 3.19.2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Still a binge drinker, Wills became increasingly unreliable in the late 1940s, causing a rift with Tommy Duncan (who bore the brunt of audience anger when Wills's binges prevented him from appearing). It ended when he fired Duncan in the fall of 1948.

===Winding down===
Having lived a lavish lifestyle in California, in 1949 Wills moved back to Oklahoma City, then went back on the road to maintain his payroll and Wills Point. An even more disastrous business decision came when he opened a second club, the Bob Wills Ranch House in [[Dallas]], [[Texas]]. Turning the club over to managers later revealed to be dishonest left Wills in desperate financial straits with heavy debts to the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] for back [[tax]]es that caused him to sell many assets including, mistakenly, the rights to &quot;New San Antonio Rose.&quot; It wrecked him financially.

In 1950 Wills had two Top Ten hits, &quot;Ida Red Likes the Boogie&quot; and &quot;[[Faded Love]]&quot;. After 1950 radio stations began to increasingly specialize in one form or another of commercially popular music. Wills did not fit into the popular Nashville country and western stations, although he was usually labeled &quot;country and western&quot;. Neither did he fit into the pop or middle of the road stations, although he played a good deal of pop music, and was not accepted in the pop music world.&lt;ref&gt;San Antonio Rose - The Life and Music of Bob Wills. Charles R. Townsend. 1976. University of Illinois. p. 281. ISBN 0-252-00470-1.&lt;/ref&gt;

He continued to tour and record through the 1950s into the early 1960s, despite the fact that Western swing's popularity, even in the Southwest, had greatly diminished. Bob could draw &quot;a thousand people on Monday night between 1950 and 1952, but he could not do that by 1956. Entertainment habits had changed.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;San Antonio Rose - The Life and Music of Bob Wills. Charles R. Townsend. 1976. University of Illinois. p. 267. ISBN 0-252-00470-1.&lt;/ref&gt;

On Wills' return to Tulsa late in 1957, Jim Downing of the ''[[Tulsa Tribune]]'' wrote an article headlined &quot;Wills Brothers Together Again — Bob Back with Heavy Beat&quot;. The article quotes Wills as saying, &quot;Rock and Roll? Why, man, that's the same kind of music we've been playin' since 1928!...We didn't call it rock and roll back when we introduced it as our style back in 1928, and we don't call it rock and roll the way we play it now. But it's just basic rhythm and has gone by a lot of different names in my time. It's the same, whether you just follow a drum beat like in Africa or surround it with a lot of instruments. The rhythm's what's important.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;San Antonio Rose - The Life and Music of Bob Wills. Charles R. Townsend. 1976. University of Illinois. pp. 268, 269. ISBN 0-252-00470-1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even a 1958 return to KVOO, where his younger brother [[Johnnie Lee Wills]] had maintained the family's presence, did not produce the success he hoped for. He appeared twice on ABC-TV's ''[[Jubilee USA (TV series)|Jubilee USA]]'' and kept the band on the road into the 1960s. After two heart attacks, in 1965 he dissolved the Texas Playboys (who briefly continued as an independent unit) to perform solo with house bands. While he did well in Las Vegas and other areas, and made records for the [[Kapp Records]] label, he was largely a forgotten figure — even though inducted into the [[Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum|Country Music Hall of Fame]] in 1968. A 1969 stroke left his right side paralyzed, ending his active career.

The May 26, 1975 issue of [[Time (magazine)|''TIME'']] (Milestones section) read: &quot;Died. Bob Wills, 70, &quot;Western Swing&quot; bandleader-composer; of pneumonia; in Fort Worth. Wills turned out dance tunes that are now called country rock, introducing with his Texas Playboys such C &amp; W classics as Take Me Back to Tulsa and New San Antonio Rose&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Milestones&quot;. - [[Time (magazine)|''TIME'']]. - May 26, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Wills' style influenced performers [[Buck Owens]] and [[Merle Haggard]] and helped to spawn a style of music now known as the [[Bakersfield Sound]]. ([[Bakersfield, California]] was one of Wills' regular stops in his heyday). A 1970 [[tribute album]] by Haggard directed a wider audience to Wills' music, as did the appearance of younger &quot;revival&quot; bands like [[Asleep at the Wheel]] and the growing popularity of longtime Wills disciple and fan [[Willie Nelson]]. By 1971, Wills recovered sufficiently to travel occasionally and appear at tribute concerts. In 1973 he participated in a final reunion session with members of some the Texas Playboys from the 1930s to the 1960s. Merle Haggard was invited to play at this reunion. The session, scheduled for two days, took place in December 1973, with the album to be titled ''For the Last Time''. Wills, speaking or attempting to holler, appeared on a couple tracks from the first day's session but suffered a stroke overnight. He had a more severe one a few days later. The musicians completed the album without him. Wills by then was comatose. He lingered until his death on May 13, 1975.

In addition to being inducted into the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]] in 1968, Wills was inducted into the [[Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame]] in 1970, the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in the Early Influence category along with the Texas Playboys in 1999, and received the [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]] in 2007.

From the 1970s until his 2002 death, [[Waylon Jennings]] performed a song called &quot;Bob Wills is Still the King&quot;. In addition, [[The Rolling Stones]] performed this song live in [[Austin, Texas]] at [[Zilker Park]] for their DVD ''The Biggest Bang''. In a 1968 issue of ''Guitar Player'', rock guitarist [[Jimi Hendrix]] said of Wills and the Playboys: &quot;I dig them.  The Grand Ole Opry used to come on, and I used to watch that.  They used to have some pretty heavy cats, some heavy guitar players.&quot;

Wills ranked No. 27 in &quot;[[CMT]]'s 40 Greatest Men in Country Music&quot; in 2003.

[[Fats Domino]] once remarked that he patterned his 1960 rhythm section after that of Bob Wills.&lt;ref&gt;San Antonio Rose - The Life and Music of Bob Wills. Charles R. Townsend. 1976. University of Illinois. p. 293. ISBN 0-252-00470-1.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[49th Grammy Awards]], [[Carrie Underwood]] performed his song &quot;[[San Antonio Rose]]&quot;. Today, [[George Strait]] performs Wills' music on concert tours and also records songs greatly reflecting the magic of Wills and his Texas-style swing.

[[Asleep at the Wheel]], the [[Austin, Texas]]-based Western swing band has been paying homage to Wills for over 35 years, best demonstrated by their continuing performances of the musical drama ''[[Asleep at the Wheel#A Ride With Bob|A Ride With Bob]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aridewithbob.com/ |title=A Ride With Bob |publisher=A Ride With Bob |date= |accessdate=2010-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; which debuted in Austin in March 2005 to coincide with celebrations of Wills' 100th birthday.

Another band that contributes to keeping the Western swing tradition alive are The Armadillos, who hail from Manchester, England and have been performing for more than 15 years.

In 2004, a documentary film about his life and music music, entitled ''Fiddlin' Man: The Life and Times of Bob Wills'', was released by VIEW Inc.

In 2011, [[Proper Records]] released an album by [[Hot Club of Cowtown]] titled ''What Makes Bob Holler: A Tribute to Bob Wills and His Texas Playboys''.

'''BadTrans''' is a malicious [[Microsoft Windows]] [[computer worm]] distributed by [[e-mail]]. Because of a known vulnerability in older versions of [[Internet Explorer]], some e-mail programs, such as Microsoft's [[Outlook Express]] and [[Microsoft Outlook]] programs, may install and execute the worm as soon as the e-mail message is viewed.

Once executed, the worm replicates by sending copies of itself to other e-mail addresses found on the host's machine, and installs a [[keystroke logging|keystroke logger]], which then captures everything typed on the affected computer.  Badtrans then transmits the data to one of several e-mail addresses.  
(For more technical details on the worm, see [http://www.cert.org/incident_notes/IN-2001-14.html this.])

Among the e-mail addresses that received the keyloggers were free addresses at [[Excite]], [[Yahoo!|Yahoo]], and IJustGotFired.com. IJustGotFired is a free service of [[MonkeyBrains]], a [[San Francisco]]-based [[Internet service provider]].
The target address at IJustGotFired began receiving e-mails at 3:23pm on November 24, 2001.  Once the account exceeded its quotas, it was automatically disabled, but the messages were still saved as they arrived.  The address received over 100,000 keylogs in the first day alone.

In mid-December, the [[FBI]] contacted [[Rudy Rucker, Jr.]], owner of MonkeyBrains, and requested a copy of the keylogged data. All of that data was stolen from the victims of the worm; it includes no information about the creator of Badtrans.
Instead of complying with the FBI request, MonkeyBrains published a database website http://badtrans.monkeybrains.net for the public to determine if a given address has been compromised.  The database does not reveal the actual passwords or keylogged data.

'''Barış Manço''' (also spelled '''Baris Mancho''' in some European album releases) (January 2, 1943 - January 31, 1999) was a [[Turkey|Turkish]] [[rock music|rock]] singer, composer, and television producer.&lt;ref&gt;Variety's Film Reviews 1985-1986 (Vol 19) by R R Bowker Publishing, ISBN 978-0-8352-2799-5&lt;/ref&gt; He composed about 200 songs, some of which were translated into a variety of languages including [[English Language|English]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Baris Manco|publisher=Light Millennium|url=http://www.lightmillennium.org/biographies/bmanco_biography.html|accessdate=2011-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; He remains one of the most popular public figures of Turkey.

==Early life and career==
Manço was born in [[Istanbul]], [[Turkey]] on January 2, 1943. His mother, [[Rikkat Uyanık]], was a famous singer in early 1940s.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} His older brother, who was born during [[World War II]], was named Savaş{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} (&quot;war&quot; in [[Turkish language|Turkish]]) while he was named Barış (&quot;peace&quot; in Turkish) by his parents to celebrate the end of the war.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} His fame greatly popularized the use of the name Barış in Turkey.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

In primary school his head was shaven to prevent [[head lice]], a serious threat back then, which he cited among reasons for his later signature long hair.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

During his highschool days in [[Galatasaray Lisesi]] (and later in Şişli Terakki High School) he formed his first band, '''Kafadarlar''' (&quot;The Buddies&quot;), allegedly upon seeing [[Erkin Koray]]'s band performing, all students of a nearby highschool.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} '''Asaf Savaş Akat''', a famous economist in Turkey, played [[saxophone]],{{Clarify|date=January 2010}} and [[guitarist]] '''Ender Enön''' made his own guitar because it was difficult to find a real one on the market in those years.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

In 1962 and 1963, with his next band, '''Harmoniler''' (&quot;The Harmonies&quot;), he recorded cover versions of some of popular American [[twist]] songs and rearrangements of Turkish folk songs in [[rock and roll]] form, marking the beginning of the [[Anatolian rock]] movement,{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} a synthesis of [[Turkish folk music]] and [[rock music|rock]]. In this period, his key visual and musical influence was [[Elvis Presley]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

After graduating from high school in 1963, he moved to Europe, travelling around [[Paris]] and [[Liège (city)|Liège]], where he formed bands with local musicians and recorded some singles mainly in English and in French but also in Turkish. He toured with his band '''Les Mistigris''' (not related to [[Mistigris]]) in [[Germany]], [[Belgium]], [[France]] and [[Turkey]] until 1967.

In 1967, he suffered a serious car accident,{{Clarify|date=January 2010}} after which he started to grow his signature mustache to disguise his scar.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

Frustrated by the difficulties of working with musicians from different nationalities, he formed '''Kaygısızlar''' (The Carefrees), featuring [[Mazhar Alanson]] and [[Fuat Güner]], future members of the band [[MFÖ]]. He recorded several singles and toured with the band, both domestically and internationally, until the band members revealed that they did not want to live abroad.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

In 1970, he formed '''Barış Manço Ve ...''' (&quot;Barış Manço and ...&quot;) again with foreign musicians, to record his first hit single, both in Turkey and in Belgium, ''Dağlar Dağlar'' (Mountains, Mountains!), selling over 700,000 copies.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} Today, the song remains one of his most popular works.

==1970s==
After the success of &quot;Dağlar Dağlar&quot;, Manço recorded a couple of singles with [[Moğollar]] (The Mongols), another influential Turkish Anatolian rock band. He then decided to return to Turkey where he recorded with the reformed Kaygısızlar for a short period. In 1971, his early works were compiled under his first full length album ''Dünden Bugüne'', today commonly referred as ''Dağlar Dağlar''.

In 1972, he formed [[Kurtalan Ekspres]], a legend by itself, the band that would accompany him until his death. In 1975 until when he continued to release singles, he released his first non-compilation LP ''2023'', a [[concept album]] that includes many instrumental songs.

As a last attempt to reach international success, he released the LP titled ''Baris Mancho'' (1976), a strange transcription of his name, mostly with '''George Hayes Orchestra''' under [[CBS Records]] label, in Europe and South Africa. Although the album did not bring the fame he was expecting, it did reach the top of the charts in [[Romania]] and [[Morocco]]. Next year, the album was released in Turkey under the title ''Nick the Chopper''.

From 1977 to 1980, he released three more albums in Turkey, partly consisting of compilations of older singles, namely ''Sakla Samanı Gelir Zamanı'' (1977), ''Yeni Bir Gün'' (1979) and ''20. Sanat Yılı Disko Manço'' (1980), all following a similar sound with ''2023''. All these albums are now rarity items, but most of the material from the era are available in later compilations ''Ben Bilirim'' and ''Sarı Çizmeli Mehmet Ağa''.is company

==1980s==
In 1981, Manço released ''Sözüm Meclisten Dışarı'' with Kurtalan Ekspres, containing many hit songs including &quot;Alla Beni Pulla Beni&quot;, &quot;Arkadaşım Eşşek&quot;, &quot;Gülpembe&quot;, &quot;Halhal&quot; and &quot;Dönence&quot; among others. The album remains as one of their most popular works and launched a boost of popularity for Barış Manço during 1980s.

&quot;Arkadaşım Eşşek&quot; (&quot;My Friend Donkey&quot;), quickly grew very popular among children (the song is about rural nostalgia and was not initially intended as a children's song){{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}. Throughout his career, he went on to write many other songs primarily for children to achieve an iconic acceptance among Turkish children of 1980s and 1990s.

On the other hand &quot;Gülpembe&quot;, composed by Kurtalan Ekspres bassist [[Ahmet Güvenç]], a requiem for Manço's grandmother, caught older audiences and probably is the artist's most popular song, competing perhaps only with &quot;Dağlar Dağlar&quot;.

In 1983, ''Estağfurullah, Ne Haddimize'' was released. It contained hit songs &quot;Halil İbrahim Sofrası&quot; and &quot;Kol Düğmeleri&quot;, a new version of the artist's very first song. &quot;Halil İbrahim Sofrası&quot; exemplified Manço's signature moral themed lyrics, a rare feature in [[Turkish pop music]].

In 1985, ''24 Ayar Manço'' which included &quot;Gibi Gibi&quot; and a long conceptual song &quot;Lahburger&quot; was released. It also marked the beginning of the shift in Manço's sound characterized with the heavy use of [[synthesizer]]s and [[drum machine]] in contrast with his older works consisting of a group oriented rock based sound. In subsequent years, Manço released ''Değmesin Yağlı Boya'' (1986), ''Sahibinden İhtiyaçtan'' (1988) and ''Darısı Başınıza'' (1989), all containing a couple of hit songs and demonstrating his new sound.

==7'den 77'ye and 1990s==
[[File:Erkan Umut &amp; Baris Manco in Mexico 1998.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Senior cameraman Erkan Umut &amp; Barış Manço in [[Teotihuacan]], [[Mexico]] (1998)]]
In 1988, ''7'den 77'ye'' (''From age 7 to 77''), a TV show directed and presented by Manço began to run on [[TRT 1]], the national TV channel of Turkey. It was a combined music, talk show and documentary program which was a major hit during the 8 years it stayed on air. Manço travelled almost 150 countries for the show. &quot;Adam Olacak Çocuk&quot;
, a part of the show, strengthened Manço's acceptance among children.

''The main production crew of his TV shows when the shows were on paramount:''
Yavuz Zafer, senior cameraman; [http://www.erkanumut.com Erkan Umut], cameraman (later senior cameraman); Kenan Eryılmaz (lighting); Binnur Kayak, assistant director; Nilüfer Ülkügüner, assistant director; Dr. Üstün Aydıngöz, projects coordinator; Tamer Şahin, coordinator general (also manager); Umut Germeyan, production manager; [http://www.yagmuryapim.com Berna Korkut], production manager (former editor and director for TRT shows); Belma Korkut, production attendant (former assistant editor and director for TRT shows); Melih Erdem, production attendant (also concert attendant); Can Şahin, production attendant (also driver).

Although his popularity continued mostly due to the TV show, his musical works in 1990s were not well received. The albums ''Mega Manço'' (1992) and ''Müsadenizle Çocuklar'' (1995) were considered as the weakest efforts of his career, despite the limited success of 1992 children hit &quot;Ayı&quot; (The Bear). On the other hand, in 1995 he toured in [[Japan]] with Kurtalan Ekspres, leading to ''Live In Japan'' (1996), his first and only live album. He released two albums in that country with some recognition as &quot;the man who writes songs about vegetables&quot;, referring to &quot;Domates, Biber, Patlıcan&quot; (&quot;Tomato, Pepper, Aubergine&quot;) and &quot;Nane, Limon Kabuğu&quot; (Mint, Lemon Rind), two of his hit songs from 1980s.

==Death==
On January 31, 1999, Barış Manço died of a sudden heart attack before the release of his just finished last work ''Mançoloji'' (''Mançology'' or ''Manchology'') (1999), a double album containing the new recordings of his hit songs along with an unfinished instrumental song &quot;40. Yıl&quot; (&quot;The 40th Anniversary&quot;), celebrating his 40th year in music. His sudden death caused an almost unanimous shock in Turkey with millions of people mourning and tens of thousands of people attending his funeral.

==Legacy==
Barış Manço was one of the most influential Turkish musicians. In his early career he and his bands contributed to the [[Turkish rock]] movement by combining traditional Turkish music with [[rock music|rock]] influences, which is still one of the main trends of Turkish popular music.

His visual image, characterized by his long hair, mustache and big rings, softened the reaction of the otherwise conservative Turkish public opinion.

His experimentation with electronic instruments in the late 1980s contributed to the 1990s sound of Turkish popular music.

His lyrics with diverse themes, mostly following a somewhat modernized version of the &quot;aşık&quot; (wandering folk poets) tradition were heavily marginal in the popular music scene of 1980s which was mostly dominated by love-themed lyrics.

In 2002, a tribute album was released under the name ''Yüreğimdeki Barış Şarkıları'' (&quot;Barış's Songs In My Heart&quot;, also &quot;Peace Songs In My Heart&quot;) featuring 15 extremely popular Turkish artists of such diverse genres as [[arabesque music|arabesque]], pop and rock (both Anatolian and western style) demonstrating his wide range of influence.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;!-- This article uses 3 forms of the topic name: &quot;Blitz BASIC&quot;, &quot;Blitz Basic&quot;, &quot;BlitzBasic&quot;. Are all of these correct in some context(s)? Would someone with domain knowledge, a BlitzExpert, clarify the text to show why 3 names are needed, or correct the text with care and precision. Thank you.

This should be *BlitzBasic* (as marksibly [the creator] refers to it as so - http://marksibly.blogspot.com/2009/08/welcome.html ).

Blitz BASIC refers to Blitz-esque syntax.

--&gt;
'''Blitz BASIC''' refers to the [[programming language]] dialect that was interpreted by the first Blitz compilers, devised by [[New Zealand]]-based developer Mark Sibly. Being derived from [[BASIC]], Blitz syntax was designed to be easy to pick-up for beginners first learning to program.  The languages are game-programming orientated but are often found general-purpose enough to be used for most types of application.  The Blitz language evolved as new products were released, with recent incarnations offering support for more advanced programming techniques such as [[object-oriented programming|object-orientation]] and [[multi-threading]].  This led to the languages losing their [[BASIC]] moniker in later years.

== History ==

The first iteration of the Blitz language was created for the [[Amiga]] platform and published by the [[Australia]]n firm '''Memory and Storage Technology'''.  Returning to [[New Zealand]], '''Blitz2''' was published several years later by '''Acid Software''' (a local Amiga game publisher).  Since then, Blitz compilers have been released on several [[Platform (computing)|platforms]].

=== BlitzBasic ===
[[Idigicon]] published '''BlitzBasic''' for [[Microsoft Windows]] in October 2000.  The language included a built-in API for performing basic 2D-graphics and audio operations.  Following the release of Blitz3D, BlitzBasic is often synonymously referred to as '''Blitz2D'''.

Recognition of BlitzBasic increased when a limited range of &quot;free&quot; versions were distributed on popular UK computer magazines such as [[PC Format]]. This resulted in a legal dispute between the developer and publisher which was eventually resolved amicably.

=== Blitz3D ===
'''Blitz3D''' was released for [[Microsoft Windows]] in September 2001, competing with other similar PC game-development languages of the time (such as [[Dark Basic]]). Blitz3D extended BlitzBasic's command-set with the inclusion of an API for a [[DirectX 7]]-based 3D engine.

Although originally Blitz3D's distribution rights were owned by [[Idigicon]], Blitz Research Ltd. later signed a deal with the firm so as to allow Blitz Research Ltd. to distribute Blitz3D themselves.  In return, Idigicon were granted full rights to distribute BlitzBasic and to clear any outstanding stock copies of Blitz3D.

=== BlitzPlus ===
In February 2003, Blitz Research Ltd. released '''BlitzPlus''' also for [[Microsoft Windows]]. It lacked the 3D engine of Blitz3D, but did bring new features to the 2D side of the language by implementing limited Microsoft Windows control support for creating native [[GUI]]s.  Backwards compatibility of the 2D engine was also extended, allowing compiled BlitzPlus games and applications to run on systems that might only have [[DirectX]] 1.

=== BlitzMax ===

The first '''BlitzMax''' compiler was released in December 2004 for [[Mac OS X]]. This made it the first Blitz dialect that could be compiled on *nix platforms. Compilers for [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Linux]] were subsequently released in May 2005. BlitzMax brought the largest change of language structure to the modern range of Blitz products by extending the type system to include [[object-oriented programming|object-oriented]] concepts and modifying the graphics API to better suit [[OpenGL]]. BlitzMax was also the first of the Blitz languages to represent strings internally using [[UCS2]], allowing native-support for strings literals composed of non-[[ASCII]] characters.

BlitzMax's platform-agnostic command-set allows developers to compile and run source code on multiple platforms. However the official compiler and build chain will only generate binaries for the platform that it is executing on. Unofficially, users have been able to get Linux and Mac OS X to cross-compile to the Windows platform.

BlitzMax is also the first [[modularity (programming)|modular]] version of the Blitz languages, improving the extensibility of the command-set. In addition, all of the standard modules shipped with the compiler are open-source and so can be tweaked and recompiled by the programmer if necessary.  The official BlitzMax [[cross-platform]] [[GUI]] module (known as '''MaxGUI''') allows developers to write GUI interfaces for their applications on Linux ([[FLTK]]), Mac ([[Cocoa (API)|Cocoa]]) and Windows.  Various user-contributed modules extend the use of the language by wrapping such libraries as [[wxWidgets]], [[Cairo (graphics)|Cairo]], [[Fontconfig]] as well as a selection of database modules.  There are also a selection of third-party 3D modules available namely '''MiniB3D'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blitzbasic.com/Community/topics.php?forum=119 BlitzMax Modules Forums: MiniB3D]&lt;/ref&gt; - an open-source OpenGL engine which can be compiled and used on all 3 of BlitzMax's supported platforms.

In October 2007, BlitzMax 1.26 was released which included the addition of a [[reflection (computer science)|reflection]] module.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blitzbasic.com/Community/posts.php?topic=72891#814878 BlitzMax update 1.26 now available!]&lt;/ref&gt;  BlitzMax 1.32 shipped new [[thread (computer science)|threading]] and [[Lua (programming language)|Lua]] scripting modules and most of the standard library functions have been updated so that they are [[unicode]] friendly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blitzbasic.com/Community/posts.php?topic=83917#947391 BlitzMax V132 for Windows and MacIntel now up!]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Blitz3D SDK ===
'''Blitz3D SDK''' is a 3D graphics engine based on the engine in Blitz3D. It was marketed for use with [[C++]], [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]], BlitzMax and [[PureBasic]], however it could also be used with other languages that follow compatible calling conventions. As of January 2011, Blitz3D SDK is no longer listed for sale on the official Blitz website.

=== Max3D module ===

In 2008, the source code to '''Max3D''' - a [[C++]]-based cross-platform 3D engine - was released under a [[BSD license]]. The engine focused on [[OpenGL]] but had an abstract backend for other graphics drivers (such as DirectX) and made use of several open-source libraries, namely [[Assimp]], [[Boost C++ Libraries|Boost]] and [[Open Dynamics Engine|ODE]].

Despite the excitement in the Blitz community of Max3D being the eagerly awaited successor to Blitz3D, interest and support died off soon after the source code was released and eventually development came to a halt. There is no indication that Blitz Research will pickup the project again.

=== Monkey and Mojo ===

In 2011, BRL released a new cross-platform programming language called [[Monkey (programming language)|Monkey]] and its first official module called Mojo. Monkey has a very similar syntax to BlitzMax, but instead of compiling direct to assembly code, translates Monkey source files into source for a chosen language, framework or platform e.g. Windows, Mac OS X, iOS, Android, HTML5 and Flash.

==Sample code==
The following code creates a windowed application that shows the current time in binary and decimal format. This code is written in Blitz Basic, but will compile and run in both Blitz3D and BlitzPlus. See below for the same example written in BlitzMax.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Bliss bibliographic classification''' ('''BC''') is a [[library classification]] system that was created by [[Henry E. Bliss]] (1870–1955), published in four volumes between 1940 and 1953. Although originally devised in the [[United States]], it was more commonly adopted by [[United Kingdom|British]] libraries than by American ones. A second edition of the system (BC2) has been developed in Britain since 1977.

==Origins of the system==
Bliss was born in New York in 1870 and in 1891 began work in the [[library]] of the [[City College of New York|College of the City of New York]] (now [[City College of New York|City College]] of the [[City University of New York]]).

Bliss had a lifelong interest in the organization, structure and philosophy of knowledge and was very critical of the library classification systems that were available to him. He believed that because the popular [[Library of Congress Classification|Library of Congress system]] had been designed for a specific library (the [[Library of Congress]]) it had no use as a standard system outside that library. He also greatly disliked the [[Dewey Decimal Classification|Dewey Decimal system]].

Bliss wanted a classification system that would provide distinct rules yet still be adaptable to whatever kind of collection a library might have, as different libraries have different needs. His solution was the concept of “alternative location,” in which a particular subject could be put in more than one place, as long as the library made a specific choice and used it consistently.

In 1908 Bliss reclassified 60,000 of his library’s books, and in 1910 he published an article with a rough scheme of his general ideas. But as he continued to develop his system he realized that it was going to be a much larger project than he had anticipated. The first of his four volumes appeared in 1940 (the year he retired) and the last in 1953, two years before his death.

Some of the underlying policies of the BC system were:
*alternative location
*brief, concise notation
*organizing knowledge according to academic expertise
*subjects moving gradually from topic to topic as they naturally related to one another.

==Examples==
Bliss deliberately avoided the use of the [[decimal separator|decimal point]] because of his objection to [[Melvil Dewey|Dewey's]] system. Instead he used capital and lower-case letters, numerals, and every typographical symbol available on his extensive and somewhat eccentric [[typewriter]].

In the revised edition (BC2), only capital letters are used, with numerals occasionally used for special purposes. Here is an extract:

HJ&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Preventive medicine&lt;BR&gt;
.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&lt;BR&gt;
HL&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Curative medicine&lt;BR&gt;
HLK&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Primary care; general practice&lt;BR&gt;
HLY&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Secondary care, aftercare

==Adoption and change==
BC was not used by many North American libraries. The system was not without its flaws {{Vague|date=December 2009}} (the result of being largely a one-person project), and the layout of Bliss’s text was difficult to read. A few library schools sometimes taught the BC system to their students, but only in a minor way. The failure of the system to catch on in North America was partly because of its internal deficiencies but also because the Dewey Decimal and Library of Congress systems were already well established.

The City College library continued to use Bliss’s system until 1967, when it reluctantly switched to the Library of Congress system. It had become too expensive to train new staff members to use BC, and too expensive to maintain in general. Much of the Bliss stacks remain, however, as no-one has recatalogued the books.

The case was different, however, in Britain. BC proved more popular there and also spread to other English-speaking countries. Part of the reason for its success was that libraries in [[normal school|teachers’ colleges]] liked the way Bliss had organized the subject areas on teaching and education. By the mid-1950s the system was being used in at least sixty British libraries and in a hundred by the 1970s.

In 1967 the Bliss Classification Association was formed. Its first publication was the ''Abridged Bliss Classification'' (ABC), intended for school libraries. In 1977 it began to publish and maintain a much-improved, revised version of Bliss’s system, the Bliss Bibliographic Classification (Second Edition) or BC2. This retains only the broad outlines of Bliss's scheme, replacing most of the detailed notation with a new scheme based on the principles of [[faceted classification]]. 15 of approximately 28 volumes of schedules have so far been published.

The top level organisation is:

*'''2/9''' - Generalia, Phenomena, Knowledge, Information science &amp; technology

      <comment>/* Highest recorded blood alcohol level/content */ removing unsourced and apparently untrue claim.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Blood alcohol content''' ('''BAC'''), also called '''blood alcohol concentration''', '''blood ethanol concentration''', or ''blood alcohol level'' is most commonly used as a metric of [[alcohol intoxication]] for legal or medical purposes. 

Blood alcohol content is usually expressed as a [[decimal]] [[percentage]] in terms of [[the thousandth volumetric part]] of [[alcohol]] per [[LITER]] of [[blood]] in the [[human body]].   

&quot;O.01&quot; Blood alcohol content is:  The HUNDREDTH DECIMAL PART part, of the one THOUSANDTH PART of a Liter.  

In digesting these numbers it must be remembered that ONE &quot;milli&quot;-Liter is the thousandth-part of a liter.  
Therefore 1% of a &quot;milli&quot;-Liter is 0.00001-Liter.
Expressing blood-alcohol concentration as &quot;0.01&quot; is naming the hundredth part of a thousandth part.

As final example, a blood-alcohol concentration of 0.08, being the 0.08 &quot;part&quot; of a &quot;milli&quot;-Liter (ITSELF the thousandth-part of a Liter) therefore names an absolute blood-alcohol volume of 0.00008-Liter (within every liter of blood).

Each country or state may define BAC differently. For example, the [[State of California]] in the [[United States]] legally defines BAC as a ratio of grams of alcohol per 100 milliliters of blood,&lt;ref&gt;[http://dmv.ca.gov/pubs/vctop/d11/vc23152.htm California's legal definition of BAC]&lt;/ref&gt; which is equal to grams of alcohol per deciliter of blood.

Since measurement must be accurate and inexpensive, several measurement techniques are used as proxies to approximate the true parts per million measure. Some of the most common are listed here: (1) Mass of alcohol per volume of exhaled breath (for example, 0.38&amp;nbsp;mg/L; see also [[breath gas analysis]]), (2) Mass per volume of blood in the body (for example,: 0.08 g/dL), and (3) Mass of alcohol per mass of the body (for example,: 0.0013 g/Kg).

The number of [[alcoholic beverage]]s (drinks) consumed is often a poor measure of blood alcohol content because of variations in [[sex]], [[body weight]], and [[body fat]].

An ethanol level of 0.10% is equal to 22&amp;nbsp;mmol/l or 100&amp;nbsp;mg/dl of blood alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wilson E, Waring WS |title=Severe hypotension and hypothermia caused by acute ethanol toxicity |journal=Emerg Med J |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=e7 |year=2007 |month=February |pmid=17251602 |pmc=2658221 |doi=10.1136/emj.2006.041590 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.blueshieldca.com/hw/articles/hw_article.jsp?articleId=HWHW3564&amp;fromCategoryId=6&amp;_requestid=210377 |title=Blood Alcohol - Health &amp; Wellness - Blue Shield of California, Health &amp; Wellness - Blue Shield of California |format= |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This same 0.10% BAC also equates to 0.10&amp;nbsp;g/dL of blood alcohol or 0.10&amp;nbsp;g/210L of exhaled breath alcohol or 0.476&amp;nbsp;mg/L of exhaled breath alcohol. Likewise, 0.10&amp;nbsp;mg/L of exhaled breath alcohol converts to 0.02% BAC, 0.022&amp;nbsp;g/dL of blood alcohol or 0.022&amp;nbsp;g/210L of exhaled breath alcohol.

== Units of measurement ==

There are several different units in use around the world for defining blood alcohol concentration. Each is defined as either a mass of alcohol per volume of blood or a mass of alcohol per mass of blood (never a volume per volume). 1 milliliter of blood is approximately equivalent to 1.06&amp;nbsp;grams of blood. Because of this, units by volume are similar but not identical to units by mass. In the U.S. the concentration unit 1% w/v (percent weight/volume, equivalent to 10g/l or 1g per 100ml) is in use&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bookrags.com/research/blood-alcohol-concentration-dat-01/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- 0,100 g/dL = 0,100 % w/v = 100 mg/dL --&gt;. This is not to be confused with the amount of alcohol measured on the breath, as with a breathalyzer. The amount of alcohol measured on the breath is generally accepted to be proportional to the amount of alcohol present in the blood at a rate of 1:2100. Therefore, a breathalyzer measurement of 0.10&amp;nbsp;mg/L of breath alcohol converts to 0.021 g/210L of breath alcohol, or 0.021 g/dL of blood alcohol (the units of the BAC in the United States).

==Legal limits==
For purposes of law enforcement, blood alcohol content is used to define intoxication and provides a rough measure of impairment. Although the degree of impairment may vary among individuals with the same blood alcohol content, it can be measured objectively and is therefore legally useful and difficult to contest in court. Most countries disallow operation of motor vehicles and heavy machinery above prescribed levels of blood alcohol content. Operation of boats and aircraft are also regulated.

The alcohol level at which a person is considered to be legally impaired varies by country. The list below gives limits by country. These are typically blood alcohol content limits for the operation of a vehicle. In the United States, the legal limit can vary by state but for all states as of 2011 is 0.08 blood alcohol content as measured by a breath device, urinalysis or blood test. This legal limit is down from 0.15 just a few decades previously.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.local-dui-attorney.org][US BAC Levels]&lt;/ref&gt;

; Zero tolerance - it is illegal to have any alcohol in your blood while driving in these countries
Since there is always some amount of alcohol even in non-drinkers' bodies, they have to have some legal guidelines for determining what behavior is illegal. Often that guideline is something like impairment in driving to any degree that can be shown to be probably caused by recent alcohol consumption.

* [[India]] (note: In the State of Kerala, a policy of zero tolerance has developed.)&lt;ref&gt;This is according to [http://morth.nic.in/writereaddata/sublinkimages/chap13f9342852843.pdf Section 185 of Motor Vehicles Act 1988]. On first offence, the punishment is imprisonment of 6 months and/or fine of 2000 Indian Rupees (INR). If the second offence is committed within three years, the punishment is 2 years and/or fine of 3000 Indian Rupees (INR). The clause of 30 mg/dL was added by an amendment in 1994. It came into effect beginning 14 November 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;li&gt;[[Serbia]]
* [[Japan]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?db=pubmed&amp;cmd=Retrieve&amp;dopt=AbstractPlus&amp;list_uids=17729137 In June of 2002, a revision to part of the Road Traffic Act drastically increased the penalties for drinking and driving offences in Japan. Most notably, the legal blood alcohol concentration limit for driving was lowered from 0.05 mg/ml to 0.03 mg/ml.&lt;/ref&gt;
