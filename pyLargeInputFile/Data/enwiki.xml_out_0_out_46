[[File:Bituriges Vivisci.jpg|thumb|left|Coins of the [[Bituriges Vivisci]], 5th–1st century BC, derived from the coin designs of [[Greeks in pre-Roman Gaul]]. [[Cabinet des Médailles]].]]
Between 30,000 and 20,000 years ago the area of Bordeaux was inhabited by the ''[[Neanderthal]]'', whose remains have been found at a famous cave known as Pair-non-Pair, near Bourg sur Gironde, just north of Bordeaux. In historical times, around 300 BC it was the settlement of a [[List of Celtic tribes|Celtic tribe]], the [[Bituriges Vivisci]], who named the town ''Burdigala'', probably of Aquitainian origin. The name Bourde is still the name of a river south of the city.

The city fell under [[ancient Rome|Roman]] rule around 60 BC, its importance lying in the commerce of [[tin]] and lead towards Rome. Later it became capital of [[Gallia Aquitania|Roman Aquitaine]], flourishing especially during the [[Severan dynasty]] (third century). In 276 it was sacked by the [[Vandals]]. Further ravage was brought by the same Vandals in 409, the [[Visigoths]] in 414 and the [[Franks]] in 498, beginning a period of obscurity for the city.

In the late 6th century, the city reemerged as the seat of a county and an archdiocese within the [[Merovingian dynasty|Merovingian]] [[Francia|kingdom of the Franks]]. The city fell into obscurity as royal power waned in southern Gaul in the late 7th century. The city was plundered by the troops of [[Abdul Rahman Al Ghafiqi|Abd er Rahman]] in 732, after he had defeated [[Odo the Great|Duke Eudes]] and before he was killed during the [[Battle of Tours]] on 10 October.

Under the [[Carolingian dynasty|Carolingians]] were appointed a series of [[Count of Bordeaux|Counts of Bordeaux]] who served to defend the mouth of the [[Garonne]] from the [[Viking]]s. Eventually, the city was inherited by the [[Duke of Gascony|Dukes of Gascony]] in the late 10th century.

From the 12th to the 15th century, Bordeaux regained importance following the marriage of Duchess [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]] with the French-speaking Count Henri Plantagenet, born in [[Le Mans]], who became, within months of their wedding, King [[Henry II of England]]. The city flourished, primarily due to wine trade, and the [[Bordeaux Cathedral|cathedral of St. André]] was built. It was also the capital of an independent state under [[Edward, the Black Prince]] (1362–1372), but in the end, after the [[Battle of Castillon]] (1453) it was annexed by France which extended its territory. The ''Château Trompette'' (Trumpet Castle) and the ''Fort du Hâ'', built by [[Charles VII of France]], were the symbols of the new domination, which however deprived the city of its richness by halting the wine commerce with England.

In 1462, Bordeaux obtained a parliament, but regained importance only in the 16th century when it became the center of the distribution of sugar and slaves from the [[Caribbean|West Indies]] along with the traditional wine.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'', &quot;Bordeaux struggles with slave past&quot;, 28 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bordeaux adhered to the [[Fronde]], being effectively annexed to the Kingdom of France only in 1653, when the army of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] entered the city.
[[File:Edouard Manet 026.jpg|thumb|[[Édouard Manet|Edouard Manet]]: ''Harbour at Bordeaux'', 1871]]

The 18th century was the golden age of Bordeaux. Many downtown buildings (about 5,000), including those on the quays, are from this period. [[Victor Hugo]] found the town so beautiful he once said: &quot;take [[Versailles]], add [[Antwerp]], and you have Bordeaux&quot;. [[Baron Haussmann]], a long-time prefect of Bordeaux, used Bordeaux's 18th century big-scale rebuilding as a model when he was asked by Emperor [[Napoleon III of France|Napoleon III]] to transform a then still quasi-medieval Paris into a &quot;modern&quot; capital that would make France proud.

The French government relocated from Paris to Bordeaux very briefly during World War II, when it became apparent that Paris would soon fall into German hands (as in 1870 during war against [[Prussia]] and at the beginning of World War I). The French capital was soon moved again to [[Vichy]].

From 1940 to 1943, the [[Regia Marina|Italian Royal Navy]] (''[[Regia Marina|Regia Marina Italiana]]'') established [[BETASOM]], a submarine base at Bordeaux. Italian submarines participated in the [[Battle of the Atlantic (1939–1945)|Battle of the Atlantic]] from this base which was also a major base for German U-boats as headquarters of [[12. Unterseebootsflottille|12 Unterseebootsflottille (12th U-boat Flotilla)]]. The massive, reinforced concrete U-boat pens have proved impractical to demolish and are now partly used as a cultural centre for exhibitions.

==Geography==
Bordeaux is located close to the European [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] coast, in the southwest of France and in the north of the Aquitaine region. It is around {{convert|500|km|mi|lk=out|abbr=on}} southwest of Paris. The city is built on a bend of the river [[Garonne]], and is divided into two parts: the right bank to the east and left bank in the west. Historically, the left bank is more developed. In Bordeaux, the [[Garonne|Garonne River]] is accessible to [[ocean liner]]s. The left bank of the Garonne is a low-lying, often marshy plain.

===Climate===
Bordeaux's climate is usually classified as an [[oceanic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Cfb''); however, the summers tend to be warmer and the winters milder than most areas of similar classification. Substantial summer rainfall prevents its climate from being classified as [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean]].

Winters are mild because of the prevalence of westerly winds from the Atlantic. Summers are warm and long due to the influence from the Bay of Biscay (surface temperature reaches {{convert|21|to|22|°C|°F|0|abbr=on}}. The average seasonal winter temperature is {{convert|6.53|°C|°F|abbr=on}}, but recent winters have been warmer than this. The average summer seasonal temperature is {{convert|19.51|°C|°F|abbr=on}}, but every summer in the decade beginning 2001 has exceeded this average. The summer of 2003 set a record with an average temperature of {{convert|23.3|°C|°F|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;GHCN climate, GISS world climate averages, 1971–2000&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==
===Wine===
{{Main|Bordeaux wine}}
Bordeaux has about {{convert|116160|ha|acre|lk=out}} of [[vineyard]]s, 57 appellations, 10,000 wine-producing châteaux and 13,000 grape growers. With an annual production of approximately 960 million bottles,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intowine.com/bordeaux.html|title=Bordeaux Wine Region in France: World's Most Famous Fine Wine Region|publisher=IntoWine.com|accessdate=23 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bordeaux produces large quantities of everyday wine as well as some of the most expensive wines in the world. Included among the latter are the area's five ''premier cru'' ([[First Growth|first growth]]) red wines (four from Médoc and one, Château Haut-Brion, from Graves), established by the [[Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855]]:
The first growths are:

*[[Château Lafite Rothschild|Château Lafite-Rothschild]]
*[[Château Margaux]]
*[[Château Latour]]
*[[Château Haut-Brion]]
*[[Château Mouton Rothschild|Château Mouton-Rothschild]]&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;

&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;In 1855 Mouton-Rothschild was ranked a Second Growth. In 1973, it was elevated to First Growth status.&lt;ref&gt;MacNeil, K. (2001). The Wine Bible. New York, NY: Workman.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both red and [[Wine|white wines]] are made in Bordeaux. Red Bordeaux is called [[claret]] in the United Kingdom. Red wines are generally made from a blend of grapes, and may be made from [[Cabernet Sauvignon]], [[Merlot]], [[Cabernet Franc]], [[Petit verdot]], [[Malbec]], and, less commonly in recent years, [[Carménère]]. White Bordeaux is made from [[Sauvignon blanc]], [[Sémillon]], and [[Muscadelle]]. [[Graves#Sauternes AOC and Barsac AOC|Sauternes]] is a subregion of Graves known for its intensely sweet, white, [[dessert wine]]s such as [[Château d'Yquem]].

Because of a wine glut ([[wine lake]]) in the generic production, the price squeeze induced by an increasingly strong international competition, and [[vine pull schemes]], the number of growers has recently dropped from 14,000 and the area under vine has also decreased significantly. In the meanwhile however, the global demand for the first growths and the most famous labels markedly increased and their prices skyrocketed.

===Others===
The [[Laser Mégajoule]] will be one of the most powerful lasers in the world, allowing [[Research|fundamental research]] and the development of the [[laser]] and [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] technologies. This project, carried by the [[Minister of Defence (France)|French Ministry of Defence]], involves an investment of 2&amp;nbsp;billion euros. In 2009, the 600 experiments programmed each year with the Laser Mégajoule will begin. The &quot;Road of the lasers&quot;, a major project of [[regional planning]], promotes regional investment in optical and laser related industries leading to the Bordeaux area having the most important concentration of optical and laser expertise in Europe.

20,000 people work for the aeronautic industry in Bordeaux. The city has some of the biggest companies including [[Dassault Aviation|Dassault]], [[EADS Sogerma]], [[Snecma]], [[Thales Group|Thales]], SNPE, and others. The [[Dassault Aviation|Dassault Falcon]] private jets are built there as well as the [[military aircraft]] [[Dassault Rafale|Rafale]] and [[Dassault Mirage 2000|Mirage 2000]], the [[Airbus A380]] [[cockpit]], the [[Booster (rocketry)|boosters]] of [[Ariane 5]], and the [[M51 (missile)|M51 SLBM]] [[missile]].

Tourism is a major industry, especially concerning [[Winemaking|wine-making]].

Access to the port from the Atlantic ocean is via the [[Gironde estuary]]. Almost 9&amp;nbsp;million tons of goods arrive and leave each year.

==Transport==
===Road===
Bordeaux is an important road and [[Interchange (road)|motorway junction]]. The city is connected to Paris by the [[A10 autoroute (France)|A10]] motorway, with Lyon by the [[A89 autoroute|A89]], with Toulouse by the [[A62 autoroute|A62]], and with Spain by the [[A63 autoroute|A63]]. There is a {{convert|45|km|mi|abbr=on}} [[Beltway|ring road]] called the &quot;Rocade&quot; which is often very busy. The building of another ring road is under consideration.

[[File:Bordeaux Pont de Pierre.jpg|thumb|Pont-de-Pierre]]

Bordeaux has four road bridges that cross the [[Garonne]], the [[Pont de pierre (Bordeaux)|Pont de pierre]] built in the 1820s and three modern bridges built after 1960: the [[Pont Saint Jean]], just south of the Pont de pierre (both located downtown), the [[Pont d'Aquitaine]], a suspended bridge downstream from downtown, and the [[Pont François Mitterrand]], located upstream of downtown. These two bridges are part of the ring road around Bordeaux. There is also a railway bridge, completed in 2008(??).

===Rail===
The main [[Train station|railway station]], [[Gare de Bordeaux Saint-Jean]], near the centre of the city, has 4&amp;nbsp;million passengers a year. It is served by the French national ([[SNCF]]) railway's high speed train, the [[TGV]], that gets to Paris in three hours, with connections to major European centres such as [[Lille]], Brussels, [[Amsterdam]], [[Cologne]], Geneva and London. The [[TGV]] also serves [[Toulouse]] and [[Irun]] from Bordeaux. A regular train service is provided to [[Nantes]], Nice, [[Marseille]] and [[Lyon]]. The Gare Saint-Jean is the major hub for regional trains ([[Transport express régional|TER]]) operated by the [[SNCF]] to [[Arcachon]], [[Limoges]], [[Agen]], [[Périgueux]], [[Pau, Pyrénées-Atlantiques|Pau]] and [[Bayonne]].

Historically the train line used to terminate at a station on the right bank of the river Garonne near the Pont de Pierre and passengers crossed the bridge to get into the city. Subsequently a single track steel railway bridge was constructed in the 1850s by [[Gustave Eiffel]] to bring trains across the river direct into [[Gare de Bordeaux Saint-Jean]]. The old station was subsequently converted and in 2010 comprised a cinema and restaurants.

The single track Eiffel bridge became a bottleneck and a the new bridge was built which opened in 2008(??). During the planning there was much lobbying by the Eiffel family and other supporters to preserve the old bridge as a footbridge across the Garonne with possibly a museum to document the history of the bridge and Gustav Eiffel's contribution. The decision was taken to save the bridge but by early 2010 no plans had been announced as to its future use. The bridge remains intact but unused and without any means of access.

===Air===
Bordeaux is served by an [[international airport]], [[Bordeaux – Mérignac Airport|Aéroport de Bordeaux Mérignac]], located {{convert|8|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the city centre in the suburban city of [[Mérignac, Gironde|Mérignac]].

===Trams, buses and boats===
Bordeaux has an important public transport system called [[Tram et Bus de la CUB]] (TBC). This company is run by the Keolis group. The network consists of:
* 3 [[Tramway de Bordeaux|tram lines]] ([[Bordeaux Tramway Line A|A]], [[Bordeaux Tramway Line B|B]] and [[Bordeaux Tramway Line C|C]])
* 75 [[Bus lines in Bordeaux|bus routes]], all connected to the tramway network (from 1 to 96)
* 13 night bus routes (from 1 to 16)
* An [[Trolleybus|electric bus]] shuttle in the city centre
* A boat shuttle on the Garonne river
This network is operated from 5&amp;nbsp;am to 1&amp;nbsp;am

There had been several plans for a subway network to be set up but they were not progressed for both geological and financial reasons. Work on the [[Tramway de Bordeaux]] system was started in the autumn of 2000 and services started in December 2003 connecting Bordeaux with its suburban areas. It uses the ground level power supply technology [[Ground-level power supply|(APS)]], a new cable less technology developed by French company [[Alstom]] and designed to preserve the aesthetic environment by eliminating overhead cables in the historic city. Conventional overhead cables are used outside the city. The system was controversial for its considerable cost of installation, maintenance and also for the numerous initial technical problems that paralyzed the network. Many streets and squares along the tramway route became pedestrian areas, with [[Limited-access road|limited access]] by cars.

===Taxi===
There are more than 400 [[taxicab]]s in Bordeaux.

==Sport==
The [[Stade Chaban-Delmas]] is the largest stadium. It can host 35000 spectators.
There are two major sport teams in Bordeaux:
* [[FC Girondins de Bordeaux|''Girondins de Bordeaux'']] is the [[association football|football]] team. It is part of the [[Ligue 1]] in the [[Football in France|French football]] championship.
* The [[Union Bordeaux Bègles|''USB-CABBG'']] (Union de [[Stade Bordelais]] – Club Athlétique Bordeaux-Bègles) team is part of the [[Rugby Pro D2|Pro D2]] (Second Division) of the [[Rugby union|Rugby Union]] [[National Rugby League (France)|Ligue Nationale de Rugby]].
* Bordeaux is the home of one of the strongest [[cricket]] teams in France and are the current champions of the South West League.

There is a {{convert|250|m|ft|abbr=on}} wooden [[velodrome]], Vélodrome du Lac, in Bordeaux which hosts international cycling competition in the form of [[UCI Track Cycling World Cup Classics|UCI Track Cycling World Cup]] events.

{{nihongo|'''''Puzzle Bobble'''''|パズルボブル|Pazuru Boburu}}, also known as '''''Bust-a-Move''''', is a 1994 [[Arcade game|arcade]] [[computer puzzle game|puzzle game]] (for 1 or 2 players) created by [[Taito Corporation]]. It is a simple game based on Taito's popular 1986 arcade game ''[[Bubble Bobble]]'', featuring characters and themes from the original. The game's characteristically [[Cuteness in Japanese culture|&quot;cute&quot;]] [[Japanese animation]] and music, along with its play mechanics and level designs, made it successful as an arcade title and spawned several sequels and ports to home gaming systems.

== Versions ==
Two different versions of the original game were released. ''Puzzle Bobble'' was originally released in Japan only in June 1994 by Taito Corporation, running on Taito's [[Taito B System|B System]] hardware (with the preliminary title &quot;Bubble Buster&quot;). Then, 6 months later in December, the international Neo Geo version of ''Puzzle Bobble'' was released. It was almost identical aside from being in [[stereo]] and having some different sound effects and translated text.

The Neo Geo version could be set to display the alternative title &quot;Bust a Move&quot;, which was used in [[United States]], [[Canada]], and sometimes in [[Europe]]. This mode also featured anti-drugs and anti-littering messages in the title sequence.

== Gameplay ==
At the start of each round, the rectangular playing arena contains a prearranged pattern of coloured &quot;bubbles&quot;. (These are actually referred to in the translation as &quot;balls&quot;; however, they were clearly intended to be bubbles, since they pop, and are taken from ''Bubble Bobble''.) At the bottom of the screen, the player controls a device called a &quot;pointer&quot;, which aims and fires bubbles up the screen. The colour of bubbles fired is randomly generated and chosen from the colours of bubbles still left on the screen.

The fired bubbles travel in straight lines (possibly bouncing off the side walls of the arena), stopping when they touch other bubbles or reach the top of the arena. If a bubble touches identically-coloured bubbles, forming a group of three or more, those bubbles—as well as any bubbles hanging from them—are removed from the field of play, and points are awarded.

After every few shots, the &quot;ceiling&quot; of the playing arena drops downwards slightly, along with all the bubbles stuck to it. The number of shots between each drop of the ceiling is influenced by the number of bubble colours remaining. The closer the bubbles get to the bottom of the screen, the faster the music plays and if they cross the line at the bottom then the player dies and the game is over.

The objective of the game is to clear all the bubbles from the arena without dying. Bubbles will fire automatically if the player remains idle. After clearing the arena, the next round begins with a new pattern of bubbles to clear.

== Scoring system ==
As with many popular arcade games, experienced players (who can complete the game relatively easily) become much more interested in the secondary challenge of obtaining a high score (which involves a lot more skill and strategy). ''Puzzle Bobble'' caters to this interest very well, featuring an exponential scoring system which allows extremely high scores to be achieved.

&quot;Popped&quot; bubbles (that is, bubbles of the same colour which disappear) are worth 10 points each. However, ''dropped'' bubbles (that is, bubbles that were hanging from popped bubbles), are worth far more: one dropped bubble scores 20 points; two score 40; three score 80. This figure continues doubling for each bubble dropped, up to 17 or more bubbles which scores 1,310,720 points. It is possible to achieve this maximum on most rounds (sometimes twice or more), resulting in a potential total score of 30 million and beyond.

Bonus points are also awarded for completing a round quickly. The maximum 50,000-point bonus is awarded for clearing a round in 5 seconds or less; this bonus then drops down to zero over the next minute, after which no bonus is awarded.

== Two player mode ==
There are no rounds in the two player game. Both players have an arena each (both visible on screen) and an identical arrangement of coloured bubbles in each arena. When a player removes a large group (four bubbles or more) some of those removed are transferred to the opponent's arena, usually delaying their efforts to remove all the bubbles from their individual arena. In some versions, the two player game can also be played by one player against a computer opponent.

== Connections with Bubble Bobble ==
The characters and theme of the game are based on the 1986 platform arcade game ''Bubble Bobble''. A remix of the original ''Bubble Bobble'' music is played in the game's end credits.

The two dinosaurs operating the pointer are called ''Bub'' and ''Bob'' (or ''Bubblun'' and ''Bobblun'' in Japan). Their graphics and animation are based directly on the original ''Bubble Bobble'', only larger (very similar to [[Bubble Symphony]] which was released less than a month later). Less obvious is the fact that ''Puzzle Bobble'' also features all the enemies from ''Bubble Bobble'', which are trapped inside the bubbles and fly out when the bubbles pop. Inspecting the bubbles closely, one can see the enemies twitching inside the bubbles.

'''Bones''' are rigid [[organ (anatomy)|organs]] that constitute part of the [[endoskeleton]] of [[vertebrate]]s. They move, support, and protect the various organs of the body, produce [[red blood cell|red]] and [[white blood cell]]s and store [[mineral]]s.  Bone tissue is a type of dense [[connective tissue]]. Bones come in a variety of shapes and have a complex internal and external [[structure]], are lightweight yet strong and hard, and serve multiple [[Function (biology)|functions]]. One of the types of tissue that makes up bone is the mineralized [[osseous tissue]], also called bone tissue, that gives it rigidity and a [[Honeycomb (geometry)|honeycomb-like]] three-dimensional internal structure. Other types of tissue found in bones include [[bone marrow|marrow]], [[endosteum]] and [[periosteum]], [[nerve]]s, [[blood vessel]]s and [[cartilage]]. There are 206 bones in the adult human body&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = The Anatomy and Biology of the Human Skeleton|author = Steele, D. Gentry; Claud A. Bramblett|year = 1988|publisher = Texas A&amp;M University Press|page = 4|isbn = 0890963002}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 270 in an [[infant]]. The largest bone in the human body is the [[femur]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Parent and Child: An Introductory Study of Parent Education|author = Schmiedeler, Edgar; Mary Rosa McDonough|year = 1934|publisher = D. Appleton-Century|page = 31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Functions==
Bones have eleven main functions:

===Mechanical===
* Protection — Bones can serve to protect internal organs, such as the [[skull]] protecting the [[brain]] or the [[ribs]] protecting the [[heart]] and [[lungs]].
* Shape — Bones provide a frame to keep the body supported.
* Movement — Bones, [[skeletal muscle]]s, [[tendons]], [[ligament]]s and [[joint]]s function together to generate and transfer forces so that individual body parts or the whole body can be manipulated in three-dimensional space. The interaction between bone and muscle is studied in [[biomechanics]].
* Sound transduction — Bones are important in the mechanical aspect of overshadowed [[Hearing (sense)|hearing]].

===Synthetic===
* Blood production — The [[Bone marrow|marrow]], located within the [[medullary cavity]] of long bones and interstices of cancellous bone, produces blood cells in a process called [[haematopoiesis]].

===Metabolic===
* Mineral storage — Bones act as reserves of minerals important for the body, most notably [[calcium]] and [[phosphorus]].
* [[Growth factor]] storage — Mineralized bone matrix stores important growth factors such as [[insulin]]-like growth factors, transforming growth factor, [[bone morphogenetic protein]]s and others.
* [[Fat]] Storage — The yellow bone marrow acts as a storage reserve of [[fatty acid]]s.
* [[Acid]]-[[Base (chemistry)|base]] balance — Bone buffers the blood against excessive [[pH]] changes by absorbing or releasing [[Alkali salts|alkaline salts]].
* Detoxification — Bone tissues can also store [[heavy metals]] and other foreign elements, removing them from the blood and reducing their effects on other tissues. These can later be gradually released for [[excretion]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}'''
* [[Endocrine system|Endocrine]] organ — Bone controls [[phosphate]] metabolism by releasing [[Fibroblast growth factor 23|fibroblast growth factor – 23]] (FGF-23), which acts on [[kidney]]s to reduce phosphate [[reabsorption]]. Bone cells also release a hormone called [[osteocalcin]], which contributes to the regulation of [[blood sugar]] ([[glucose]]) and [[body fat|fat deposition]]. Osteocalcin increases both the [[insulin]] secretion and sensitivity, in addition to boosting the number of [[beta cell|insulin-producing cells]] and reducing stores of fat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lee|first=Na Kyung |coauthors=et al. |date=10 August 2007|title=Endocrine Regulation of Energy Metabolism by the Skeleton |journal=Cell |volume=130 |pages=456–469 |doi=10.1016/j.cell.2007.05.047 |url=http://download.cell.com/pdfs/0092-8674/PIIS0092867407007015.pdf |accessdate= 2008-03-15 |pmid=17693256 |issue=3 |pmc=2013746}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanical properties==
The primary tissue of bone, [[osseous tissue]], is a relatively [[Rockwell scale|hard]] and lightweight [[composite material]], formed mostly of [[calcium phosphate]] in the chemical arrangement termed calcium [[hydroxylapatite]] (this is the [[osseous tissue]] that gives bones their rigidity). It has relatively high [[compressive strength]], of about 170 [[Pascal (unit)|MPa]] (1800 [[kgf]]/cm²)&lt;ref name=Schmidt-Nielsen&gt;{{Cite document |date=1984 |author=Schmidt-Nielsen, Knut |authorlink=Knut Schmidt-Nielsen |title=Scaling: Why is animal size so important? |place=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=6|isbn=0-521-319870-0 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;  but poor [[tensile strength]] of 104–121 [[Pascal (unit)|MPa]] and very low [[shear stress]] strength (51.6 [[Pascal (unit)|MPa]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/s00223-001-1006-1|title=Shear Strength and Fatigue Properties of Human Cortical Bone Determined from Pure Shear Tests|year=2001|last1=Turner|first1=C.H.|last2=Wang|first2=T.|last3=Burr|first3=D.B.|journal=Calcified Tissue International|volume=69|issue=6|pages=373–378|pmid=11800235 }}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning it resists pushing forces well, but not pulling or torsional forces.  While bone is essentially [[Brittleness|brittle]], it does have a significant degree of [[elasticity (physics)|elasticity]], contributed chiefly by [[collagen]].  All bones consist of living and dead [[Cell (biology)|cells]] embedded in the mineralized organic ''matrix'' that makes up the osseous tissue.

===Individual bone structure===
[[File:Illu compact spongy bone.jpg|thumb|320px]]
[[File:Caput femoris cortex medulla.jpg|right|thumb|180px|A [[femur]] head with a [[cortex (anatomy)|cortex]] of [[Cortical bone|compact bone]] and medulla of [[trabecular bone]].]]
Bone is not a uniformly solid material, but rather has some spaces between its hard elements.

====Compact (cortical) bone====
The hard outer layer of bones is composed of [[Cortical bone|compact bone]] tissue, so-called due to its minimal gaps and spaces. Its porosity is 5–30%.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall, Susan Pg. 88&quot;&gt;Hall, Susan. (2007) ''Basic Biomechanics''. Fifth Edition. p. 88 ISBN 0071260412&lt;/ref&gt; This tissue gives bones their smooth, white, and solid appearance, and accounts for 80% of the total bone mass of an adult [[skeleton]]. Compact bone may also be referred to as dense bone.

====Trabecular (cancellous) bone====
Filling the interior of the bone is the [[Cancellous bone|trabecular bone]] tissue (an open cell [[Porosity|porous]] network also called cancellous or spongy bone), which is composed of a network of rod- and plate-like elements that make the overall organ lighter and allow room for blood vessels and marrow.  Trabecular bone accounts for the remaining 20% of total bone mass but has nearly ten times the surface area of compact bone. Its porosity is 30–90%.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall, Susan Pg. 88&quot;/&gt; If, for any reason, there is an alteration in the strain the cancellous is subjected to, there is a rearrangement of the trabeculae. The microscopic difference between compact and cancellous bone is that compact bone consists of haversian sites and [[osteons]], while cancellous bones do not. Also, bone surrounds blood in the compact bone, while blood surrounds bone in the cancellous bone.

==Cellular structure==
There are several types of cells constituting the bone;

* [[Osteoblast]]s are mononucleate bone-forming cells that descend from [[osteoprogenitor]] cells.  They are located on the surface of osteoid seams and make a [[protein]] mixture known as [[osteoid]], which mineralizes to become bone. The osteiod seam is a narrow region of newly formed organic matrix, not yet mineralized, located on the surface of a bone. Osteoid is primarily composed of Type I [[collagen]]. Osteoblasts also manufacture [[hormone]]s, such as [[prostaglandin]]s, to act on the bone itself.  They robustly produce [[alkaline phosphatase]], an [[enzyme]] that has a role in the mineralisation of bone, as well as many [[extracellular matrix|matrix proteins]]. Osteoblasts are the immature bone cells, and eventually become entrapped in the bone matrix to become osteocytes- the mature bone cell

* Bone lining cells are essentially inactive osteoblasts. They cover all of the available bone surface and function as a barrier for certain [[ion]]s.
* [[Osteocyte]]s originate from osteoblasts that have migrated into and become trapped and surrounded by bone matrix that they themselves produce. The spaces they occupy are known as [[lacuna (histology)|lacuna]]e. Osteocytes have many processes that reach out to meet osteoblasts and other osteocytes probably for the purposes of communication. Their functions include, to varying degrees: formation of bone; matrix maintenance; and calcium [[homeostasis]]. They have also been shown to act as mechano-sensory receptors — regulating the bone's response to stress and mechanical load. They are mature bone cells.

* [[Osteoclast]]s are the cells responsible for [[bone resorption]], thus they break down bone. New bone is then formed by the osteoblasts (remodeling of bone to reduce its volume). Osteoclasts are large, multinucleated cells located on bone surfaces in what are called [[Howship's lacunae]] or resorption pits. These lacunae, or resorption pits, are left behind after the breakdown of the bone surface. Because the osteoclasts are derived from a [[monocyte]] [[stem cell|stem-cell]] lineage, they are equipped with [[Phagocytosis|phagocytic]]-like mechanisms similar to circulating [[macrophages]]. Osteoclasts mature and/or migrate to discrete bone surfaces. Upon arrival, active enzymes, such as [[tartrate resistant acid phosphatase]], are [[Secretion|secreted]] against the mineral substrate.

==Molecular structure==
===Matrix===
The majority of bone is made of the bone matrix. It has inorganic and organic parts.  Bone is formed by the hardening of this matrix entrapping the cells. When these cells become entrapped from osteoblasts they become osteocytes.

====Inorganic====
[[File:Bertazzo S SEM deproteined bone - cranium rat - x10k.jpg|thumb| Electronic micrography 10000 magnification of Bone mineral.]]
The inorganic composition of bone ([[bone mineral]]) is formed from carbonated [[hydroxyapatite]] &lt;ref name=&quot;Legros, R. 1987&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=3117340|year=1987|last1=Legros|first1=R|last2=Balmain|first2=N|last3=Bonel|first3=G|title=Age-related changes in mineral of rat and bovine cortical bone|volume=41|issue=3|pages=137–44|journal=Calcified tissue international}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=4412232|year=1974|last1=Field|first1=RA|last2=Riley|first2=ML|last3=Mello|first3=FC|last4=Corbridge|first4=MH|last5=Kotula|first5=AW|title=Bone composition in cattle, pigs, sheep and poultry|volume=39|issue=3|pages=493–9|journal=Journal of animal science}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Ca&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) with lower crystallinity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Legros, R. 1987&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=r1&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bertazzo, S. &amp; Bertran, C. A. |year=2006|title=Morphological and dimensional characteristics of bone mineral crystals|journal= Bioceramics |issue=Pt. 1, 2|volume=309–311|pages=3–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The matrix is initially laid down as unmineralised osteoid (manufactured by osteoblasts). Mineralisation involves osteoblasts secreting [[vesicle (biology)|vesicles]] containing alkaline phosphatase. This cleaves the phosphate groups and acts as the foci for calcium and phosphate deposition. The vesicles then rupture and act as a centre for crystals to grow on.
More particularly, bone mineral is formed from globular and plate structures,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.4028/www.scientific.net/KEM.309-311.11|title=Morphological Characterization of Femur and Parietal Bone Mineral of Rats at Different Ages|year=2006|last1=Bertazzo|first1=S.|last2=Bertran|first2=C.A.|last3=Camilli|first3=J.A.|journal=Key Engineering Materials|volume=309-311|pages=11–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=r1/&gt; distributed among the collagen fibrils of bone and forming yet larger structure.

====Organic====
The organic part of matrix is mainly composed of Type I [[collagen]]. This is synthesised intracellularly as tropocollagen and then exported, forming [[fibril]]s. The organic part is also composed of various growth factors, the functions of which are not fully known. Factors present include [[glycosaminoglycan]]s, [[osteocalcin]], [[osteonectin]], [[bone sialo protein]], [[osteopontin]] and Cell Attachment Factor. One of the main things that distinguishes the matrix of a bone from that of another cell is that the matrix in bone is hard.

===Woven or lamellar===
[[File:Woven bone matrix.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Collagen fibers of woven bone]]
Two types of bone can be identified microscopically according to the pattern of collagen forming the osteoid (collagenous support tissue of type I collagen embedded in glycosaminoglycan gel): 

* Woven bone, which is characterised by haphazard organisation of collagen fibers and is mechanically weak

* Lamellar bone, which has a regular parallel alignment of collagen into sheets (lamellae) and is mechanically strong

Woven bone is produced when osteoblasts produce osteoid rapidly, which occurs initially in all [[fetus|fetal]] bones (but is later replaced by more resilient lamellar bone). In adults woven bone is created after [[fracture]]s or in [[Paget's disease of bone|Paget's disease]]. Woven bone is weaker, with a smaller number of randomly oriented collagen fibers, but forms quickly; it is for this appearance of the fibrous matrix that the bone is termed ''woven''. It is soon replaced by lamellar bone, which is highly organized in [[concentric]] sheets with a much lower proportion of osteocytes to surrounding tissue. Lamellar bone, which makes its first appearance in the [[fetus]] during the third trimester,&lt;ref name=&quot;Salentijn&quot;&gt;Salentijn, L. ''Biology of Mineralized Tissues: Cartilage and Bone'', [[Columbia University College of Dental Medicine]] post-graduate dental lecture series, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; is stronger and filled with many collagen fibers parallel to other fibers in the same layer (these parallel columns are called osteons).  In [[Cross section|cross-section]], the fibers run in opposite directions in alternating layers, much like in [[plywood]], assisting in the bone's ability to resist [[torsion (mechanics)|torsion]] forces.  After a fracture, woven bone forms initially and is gradually replaced by lamellar bone during a process known as &quot;bony substitution.&quot; Compared to woven bone , lamellar bone formation takes place more slowly. The orderly deposition of collagen fibers restricts the formation of osteoid to about 1 to 2&amp;nbsp;[[Micrometre|µm]] per day. Lamellar bone also requires a relatively flat surface to lay the collagen fibers in parallel or concentric layers.

These terms are [[histology|histologic]], in that a microscope is necessary to differentiate between the two.

==Types==
[[File:Illu long bone.jpg|250px|thumb]]
There are five types of bones in the human body: long, short, flat, irregular and sesamoid.
* [[Long bones]] are characterized by a shaft, the [[diaphysis]], that is much longer than it is wide. They are made up mostly of [[Cortical bone|compact bone]], with lesser amounts of [[Bone marrow|marrow]], located within the [[medullary cavity]], and [[Cancellous bone|spongy bone]]. Most bones of the [[Limb (anatomy)|limbs]], including those of the [[metacarpus|fingers]] and [[metatarsus|toes]], are long bones. The exceptions are those of the [[carpal|wrist]], [[tarsus (skeleton)|ankle]] and [[patella|kneecap]].
* [[Short bones]] are roughly [[cube]]-shaped, and have only a thin layer of compact bone surrounding a spongy interior.  The bones of the wrist and ankle are short bones, as are the [[sesamoid bones]].
* [[Flat bone]]s are thin and generally curved, with two parallel layers of compact bones sandwiching a layer of spongy bone.  Most of the bones of the [[skull]] are flat bones, as is the [[sternum]].
* [[Irregular bones]] do not fit into the above categories.  They consist of thin layers of compact bone surrounding a spongy interior.  As implied by the name, their shapes are irregular and complicated.  The bones of the [[Vertebral column|spine]] and [[Hip bone|hips]] are irregular bones.
* [[Sesamoid bones]] are bones embedded in tendons.  Since they act to hold the tendon further away from the joint, the angle of the tendon is increased and thus the leverage of the muscle is increased.  Examples of sesamoid bones are the patella and the [[pisiform]].

==Formation==
The formation of bone during the fetal stage of development occurs by two processes: [[Intramembranous ossification]] and [[endochondral ossification]].

===Intramembranous ossification===
Intramembranous ossification mainly occurs during formation of the flat bones of the [[skull]] but also the mandible, maxilla, and clavicles; the bone is formed from connective tissue such as [[mesenchyme]] tissue rather than from cartilage.  The steps in intramembranous ossification are:
# Development of ossification center
# Calcification
# Formation of trabeculae
# Development of periosteum

===Endochondral ossification===
[[File:Bone growth.png|450px|right|thumb|Endochondrial ossification]]

Endochondral ossification, on the other hand, occurs in long bones and most of the rest of the bones in the body; it involves an initial hyaline cartilage that continues to grow.  The steps in endochondral ossification are:
# Development of cartilage model
# Growth of cartilage model
# Development of the primary ossification center
# Development of the secondary ossification center
# Formation of articular cartilage and [[epiphyseal plate]]

Endochondral ossification begins with points in the cartilage called &quot;primary ossification centers.&quot; They mostly appear during fetal development, though a few short bones begin their primary ossification after [[birth]].  They are responsible for the formation of the diaphyses of long bones, short bones and certain parts of irregular bones.  Secondary ossification occurs after birth, and forms the [[Epiphysis|epiphyses]] of long bones and the extremities of irregular and flat bones.  The diaphysis and both epiphyses of a long bone are separated by a growing zone of cartilage (the [[epiphyseal plate]]). When the child reaches skeletal maturity (18 to 25 years of age), all of the cartilage is replaced by bone, fusing the diaphysis and both epiphyses together (epiphyseal closure).

===Bone marrow===

[[Bone marrow]] can be found in almost any bone that holds [[cancellous tissue]].  In [[Offspring|newborns]], all such bones are filled exclusively with red marrow, but as the child ages it is mostly replaced by yellow, or ''fatty'' marrow.  In adults, red marrow is mostly found in the marrow bones of the femur, the ribs, the vertebrae and pelvic bones.

==Remodeling==
''[[Bone remodeling|Remodeling]]'' or ''bone turnover'' is the process of resorption followed by replacement of bone with little change in shape and occurs throughout a person's life. Osteoblasts and osteoclasts, coupled together via [[paracrine|paracrine cell signalling]], are referred to as bone remodeling units.

===Purpose===
The purpose of remodeling is to regulate [[calcium homeostasis]], repair [[Microdamage in bone|micro-damaged bones]] (from everyday stress) but also to shape and sculpture the skeleton during growth.

====Calcium balance====
The process of bone resorption by the osteoclasts releases stored calcium into the systemic circulation and is an important process in regulating calcium balance. As bone formation actively ''fixes'' circulating calcium in its mineral form, removing it from the bloodstream, resorption actively ''unfixes'' it thereby increasing circulating calcium levels. These processes occur in tandem at site-specific locations.

====Repair====
Repeated stress, such as weight-bearing [[exercise]] or bone healing, results in the bone thickening at the points of maximum stress ([[Wolff's law]]). It has been hypothesized that this is a result of bone's [[piezoelectricity|piezoelectric]] properties, which cause bone to generate small electrical potentials under stress.&lt;ref&gt;Netter, pp. 187–189, A scholarly review of the subject.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Paracrine cell signalling==
The action of [[osteoblast]]s and [[osteoclast]]s are controlled by a number of chemical [[Enzyme|factors]] that either promote or inhibit the activity of the bone remodeling cells, controlling the rate at which bone is made, destroyed, or changed in shape.  The cells also use [[paracrine signalling]] to control the activity of each other.

===Osteoblast stimulation===
Osteoblasts can be stimulated to increase bone mass through increased secretion of [[osteoid]] and by [[Enzyme inhibitor|inhibiting]] the ability of osteoclasts to break down [[osseous tissue]].

Bone building through increased secretion of osteoid is stimulated by the secretion of [[growth hormone]] by the [[pituitary]], [[thyroid hormone]] and the sex hormones ([[estrogen]]s and [[androgen]]s). These hormones also promote increased secretion of [[osteoprotegerin]].&lt;ref name = Boron&gt;{{cite book |author=Boulpaep, Emile L.; Boron, Walter F. |title=Medical physiology: a cellular and molecular approach |publisher=Saunders |location=Philadelphia |year=2005 |pages=1089–1091 |isbn=1416023283 |oclc= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Osteoblasts can also be induced to secrete a number of [[cytokine]]s that promote reabsorbtion of bone by stimulating osteoclast activity and differentiation from progenitor cells. [[Vitamin D]], [[parathyroid hormone]] and stimulation from osteocytes induce osteoblasts to increase secretion of RANK-[[ligand]] and [[interleukin 6]], which cytokines then stimulate increased reabsorbtion of bone by osteoclasts.  These same compounds also increase secretion of [[macrophage colony-stimulating factor]] by osteoblasts, which promotes the differentiation of progenitor cells into osteoclasts, and decrease secretion of [[osteoprotegerin]].

===Osteoclast inhibition===
The rate at which osteoclasts resorb bone is inhibited by [[calcitonin]] and osteoprotegerin.  Calcitonin is produced by [[parafollicular cell]]s in the [[thyroid gland]], and can bind to receptors on osteoclasts to directly inhibit osteoclast activity. Osteoprotegerin is secreted by osteoblasts and is able to bind RANK-L, inhibiting osteoclast stimulation.&lt;ref name = Boron/&gt;

==Disorders==
{{See also|List of skeletal disorders}}
There are many disorders of the skeleton. One of the more prominent is [[osteoporosis]].

===Osteoporosis===
{{Main|Osteoporosis}}
Osteoporosis is a [[disease]] of bone, leading to an increased risk of [[bone fracture|fracture]]. In osteoporosis, the [[bone mineral density]] (BMD) is reduced, bone microarchitecture is disrupted, and the amount and variety of non-[[collagen]]ous proteins in bone is altered. Osteoporosis is defined by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) in women as a bone mineral density 2.5 [[standard deviation]]s below peak bone mass (20-year-old sex-matched healthy person average) as measured by [[Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry|DEXA]]; the term &quot;established osteoporosis&quot; includes the presence of a [[fragility fracture]].&lt;ref name=WHO1994&gt;{{cite journal |author=WHO |title=Assessment of fracture risk and its application to screening for postmenopausal osteoporosis. Report of a WHO Study Group |journal=World Health Organization technical report series |volume=843 |pages=1–129 |year=1994 |pmid=7941614 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Osteoporosis is most common in women after the [[menopause]], when it is called '''postmenopausal osteoporosis''', but may develop in men and premenopausal women in the presence of particular hormonal disorders and other [[Chronic (medicine)|chronic]] diseases or as a result of [[tobacco smoking|smoking]] and [[medications]], specifically [[glucocorticoid]]s, when the disease is called '''steroid-''' or '''glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis''' (SIOP or GIOP).
 
Osteoporosis can be prevented with lifestyle advice and medication, and preventing falls in people with known or suspected osteoporosis is an established way to prevent fractures. Osteoporosis can be treated with [[bisphosphonate]]s and various other medical treatments.

===Other===
Other disorders of bone include:
*[[Bone fracture]]
*[[Bone mineral]]
*[[Osteomyelitis]]
*[[Osteosarcoma]]
*[[Osteogenesis imperfecta]]
*[[Osteochondritis Dissecans]]
*[[Bone Metastases]]
*[[Neurofibromatosis type I]]

==Osteology==
The study of bones and teeth is referred to as [[osteology]].  It is frequently used in [[anthropology]], [[archeology]] and [[forensics|forensic science]] for a variety of tasks.  This can include determining the nutritional, health, age or injury status of the individual the bones were taken from.  Preparing fleshed bones for these types of studies can involve [[maceration (bone)|maceration]] – boiling fleshed bones to remove large particles, then hand-cleaning.

Typically anthropologists and archeologists study [[bone tool]]s made by [[Human|''Homo sapiens'']] and [[Neanderthal|''Homo neanderthalensis'']].  Bones can serve a number of uses such as projectile points or artistic pigments, and can be made from endoskeletal or external bones such as antler or tusk.

==Alternatives to bony endoskeletons==
There are several [[evolution]]ary alternatives to [[Mammillary process|mammillary]] bone; though they have some similar functions, they are not completely functionally analogous to bone.

* [[Exoskeleton]]s offer support, protection and levers for movement similar to endoskeletal bone.  Different types of exoskeletons include [[animal shell|shells]], [[carapace]]s (consisting of [[Calcium in biology|calcium compounds]] or [[silica]]) and [[chitin|chitinous exoskeletons]].
* A true [[endoskeleton]] (that is, protective tissue derived from mesoderm) is also present in [[Echinoderm]]s. [[Porifera]] (sponges) possess simple endoskeletons that consist of calcareous or siliceous [[spicule]]s and a spongin fiber network.

==Exposed bone==
Bone penetrating the skin and being exposed to the outside can be both a natural process in some animals, and due to injury:
*A deer's [[antler]]s are composed of bone.&lt;ref name=pmid10321994&gt;{{cite journal|title=Hard fallow deer antler: a living bone till antler casting?|author=Hans J. Rolf|coauthors=Alfred Enderle|journal=The Anatomical Record|volume=255|issue=1|pages=69–77|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/67500212/HTMLSTART|pmid=10321994|accessdate=2008-08-20|doi=10.1002/(SICI)1097-0185(19990501)255:1&lt;69::AID-AR8&gt;3.0.CO;2-R|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Instead of [[tooth|teeth]], the extinct predatory fish ''[[Dunkleosteus]]'' had sharp edges of hard exposed bone along its [[jaw]]s.
*A [[compound fracture]] occurs when the edges of a broken bone puncture the skin.
*Though not strictly speaking exposed, a [[bird]]'s [[beak]] is primarily bone covered in a layer of [[keratin]] over a vascular layer containing blood vessels and nerve endings.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''''Bretwalda''''', also '''''brytenwalda''''' and '''''bretenanwealda''''', is an [[Anglo-Saxon language|Old English]] word, the first record of which comes from the late 9th century ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]''. It is applied in the ''Chronicle'' to some of the rulers of [[History of Anglo-Saxon England|Anglo-Saxon kingdoms]] from the fifth century onwards who had achieved overlordship of some or all of the other Anglo-Saxon kingdoms. It is unclear whether the word dates back to the fifth century, and was used by the kings themselves, or whether it is a later, ninth-century invention.

The term ''bretwalda'' also appears in a charter of [[Athelstan of England|Æthelstan]], [[List of English monarchs#House_of_Wessex|King of the English]].

The rulers of [[Mercia]] were generally the most powerful of the English kings from the mid-seventh to early ninth centuries but are not accorded the title ''bretwalda'' by the ''Chronicle'', a fact usually assigned to the anti-Mercian bias of the Chroniclers. The ''[[Annals of Wales]]'' continued to recognize the [[List of monarchs of Northumbria|lords of Northumbria]] as &quot;King of the Saxons&quot; (i.e. English) until the death of [[Osred I of Northumbria|Osred I]] in 716. 

Bretwëlde, was a title in 11th and 12th century used in Ireland to denote the &quot;high king&quot;.  apparently part of the gaelic lexicon, this spelling, does suggest a germanic (saxon) origin, as the 'w' is most likely pronouced as a 'v'.

==Etymology==

The first syllable may be related to [[Britons (historical)|Briton]] or [[Great Britain in the Middle Ages|Britain]], and would thus mean &quot;sovereign of Britain&quot; or &quot;wielder of Britain&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.websters-online-dictionary.org/Ki/Kingly+Titles.html Kingly titles]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=4pxJAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA11&amp;lpg=PA11&amp;dq=bretwalda+Britain-Wielder&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ywVE3r8NkM&amp;sig=KsHapzT4HJDX8HN6grUvWSoUkOI&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=bR2xSrfqK9Gf4AbaxonYBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false; ''Europe during the Middle Ages''] by [[Samuel Astley Dunham]].&lt;/ref&gt; However the word may be a [[compound]] containing the [[Old English]] adjective ''&quot;brytten&quot;'' (from the verb ''&quot;breotan&quot;'' meaning ''&quot;to break&quot;'' or ''&quot;disperse&quot;''),&lt;ref&gt;''A Short Constitutional History of England'', H. St Clair Feilden, BiblioBazaar, LLC, 2009, ISBN 1103287591, 9781103287598. p.33&lt;/ref&gt; an element also found in the terms ''&quot;bryten rice&quot;'' (&quot;kingdom&quot;), ''&quot;bryten-grund&quot;'' (&quot;the wide expanse of the earth&quot;) and ''&quot;bryten cyning&quot;'' (&quot;king whose authority was widely extended&quot;). Though the origin is ambiguous the draughtsman of the charter issued by [[King Athelstan]] used the term in a way that can only mean &quot;wide ruler&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Voyage To The Other World: The Legacy of Sutton Hoo'', Calvin B. Kendall, Peter S. Wells, Univeristy of Minnesota Press, 1992,ISBN 0816620245, 9780816620241. p.111&lt;/ref&gt;

The latter etymology was first suggested by [[John Mitchell Kemble]]&lt;ref name=&quot;kemble&quot;/&gt; who alluded to the facts &quot;that of six manuscripts in which this passage occurs, one only reads Bretwalda: of the remaining five, four have Bryten-walda or -wealda, and one Breten-anweald, which is precisely synonymous with Brytenwealda&quot;; that Aethelstan was called &quot;brytenwealda ealles ðyses ealondes&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;kemble&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Kemble |first=John Mitchell |authorlink=John Mitchell Kemble |title=The Saxons in England: A History of the English Commonwealth till the Period of the Norman Conquest |year=1876 |publisher=Bernard Quaritch |location=London}} pages. 19–21&lt;/ref&gt; (which he translates as &quot;ruler of all these islands&quot;); and that ''&quot;bryten-&quot;'' is a common prefix to words meaning &quot;wide or general dispersion&quot; and that the similarity to the word ''&quot;bretwealh&quot;'' (''&quot;briton&quot;'') is &quot;merely accidental&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;kemble&quot;/&gt;

==Contemporary use==
The first recorded use of the term ''Bretwalda'' comes from a [[Wessex|West Saxon]] Chronicle of the late 9th century applying the term to [[Egbert of Wessex|Ecgberht]], who was King of Wessex from 802–839.&lt;ref&gt;''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' MS A, 827 for 829.&lt;/ref&gt; The chronicler also wrote down the names of seven kings [[Bede]] had listed in his ''[[Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum]]'' in 731.&lt;ref&gt;From Bede, ''[[Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum]]'' 2.5.&lt;/ref&gt; All subsequent manuscripts of the ''Chronicle'' use ''Brytenwalda'', whether it represents the original term or derives from a common error.

There is no evidence that the term ''Bretwalda'' was a title that had any practical use, with implications of formal rights, powers and office, or even that it had any existence before the ninth-century chronicler. [[Bede]] wrote in [[Latin]] and never used the term, and his list of kings holding ''imperium'' should be treated with great caution, not least in that he overlooks kings such as [[Penda]] of [[Mercia]] who clearly held some kind of dominance in their time. Similarly, in his list of ''Bretwaldas'', the [[Wessex|West Saxon]] chronicler ignores [[List of monarchs of Mercia|Mercian kings]] such as [[Offa of Mercia|Offa]]. It is unlikely that there was a succession and defined duties, and it is doubtful whether the term Bretwalda is anything more than a later simplification of a complex structure of kingship.

''Bretwalda'' is, therefore, a highly problematic term, and one which, if anything, was merely the attempt by a West Saxon chronicler to make some claim of [[List of monarchs of Wessex|West Saxon kings]] to the whole of [[Great Britain]]. This shows that the concept of the overlordship of the whole of Britain was at least recognised in the period, whatever was meant by the term. Quite possibly it was only a survival of a Roman concept of &quot;Britain&quot;; it is significant that, while the hyperbolic inscriptions on coins and titles in [[charters]] often include the title ''rex Britanniae'', when England was actually unified the title used was ''rex Angulsaxonum'', king of the Anglo-Saxons.

==Modern interpretation by historians==
For some time the existence of the word ''Bretwalda'' in the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', which was based in part on the list given by [[Bede]] in his ''Historia Ecclesiastica'', led historians to think that there was perhaps a &quot;title&quot; held by overlords of [[Great Britain]]. This was particularly attractive as it would lay the foundations for the establishment of an English monarchy. The twentieth-century historian [[Frank Stenton]] says of the Anglo-Saxon chronicler that &quot;his inaccuracy is more than compensated by his preservation of the English title applied to these outstanding kings.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;F.M. Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', 3rd edition, (Oxford: University Press, 1971), pp.34–5.&lt;/ref&gt; He goes on to argue that the term ''Bretwalda'' &quot;falls into line with the other evidence which points to the Germanic origin of the earliest English institutions.&quot;

Over the later twentieth century this assumption was increasingly challenged. [[Patrick Wormald]] interprets it as &quot;less an objectively realized office than a subjectively perceived status&quot; and emphasizes the partiality of its usage in favour of Southumbrian rulers.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Wormald, &quot;Bede, ''Bretwaldas'' and the Origins of the ''Gens Anglorum''. p. 118–9.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, Steven Fanning argues, &quot;It is unlikely that the term ever existed as a title or was in common usage in Anglo-Saxon England.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Fanning, Steven (1991) “Bede, ''Imperium'', and the Bretwaldas,” ''Speculum'' 66, no. 1 (1991): 24.&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that Bede never mentioned a special title for the kings in his list implies that he was unaware of one.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Fanning, &quot;Bede, ''Imperium'', and the Bretwaldas.&quot; 23.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995 [[Simon Keynes]] wrote, &quot;if Bede's concept of the Southumbrian overlord, and the chronicler's concept of the 'Bretwalda', are to be regarded as artificial constructs, which have no validity outside the context of the literary works in which they appear, we are released from the assumptions about political development which they seem to involve...we might ask whether kings in the eighth and ninth centuries were quite so obsessed with the establishment of a pan-Southumbrian state.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Simon Keynes, 'England, 700–900' in ''The New Cambridge Medieval History, II, c.700–c.900''. ed. R. McKitterick, (Cambridge: University Press, 1995), p.39&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, more recent interpretations view the bretwaldaship as a complex concept. It is now recognized as an important indicator of how a ninth-century chronicler interpreted history and tried to insert the West Saxon kings, who were rapidly expanding their power at the time, into that history.

==Overlordship==
What did exist was a complex array of dominance and subservience. Examples such as a king granting land with [[Anglo-Saxon Charters|charters]] in another [[Monarchy|kingdom]], are a sure sign of such a relationship. When a king held sway over a larger kingdom, such as a Mercian ruler over [[East Anglia]], the relationship would have been more equal than in the case of a larger kingdom exercising overlordship over a smaller one, as in the case of [[Mercia]] and [[Hwicce]]. Mercia was arguably the most powerful Anglo-Saxon kingdom for much of the late seventh and eighth centuries, though Mercian kings are missed out of the two main &quot;lists&quot;. For Bede, Mercia was a traditional enemy of his native Northumbria, and he saw powerful Mercian kings such as [[Penda]] (a pagan) as standing in the way of the conversion of the Anglo-Saxons, and so does not include them in his list, even though it is evident that Penda held a considerable degree of power. Similarly, powerful Mercia kings such as [[Offa of Mercia|Offa]] are missed out of the West Saxon Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, which sought to demonstrate the legitimacy of the West Saxon kings to rule over other Anglo-Saxon peoples.

[[Image:poincare.jpg|220px|thumb|right|In 1886, [[Henri Poincaré]] (pictured) proved a result that is equivalent to Brouwer's fixed point theorem. The three-dimensional case of the exact statement was proved in 1904 by Piers Bohl, and the general case in 1910 by [[Jacques Hadamard]]. [[Luitzen Egbertus Jan Brouwer]] proposed a new proof in 1912.]]
'''Brouwer's fixed point theorem''' is a [[fixed point theorem]] in [[topology]], named after [[Luitzen Egbertus Jan Brouwer|Luitzen Brouwer]]. It states that for any continuous function ''f'' with certain properties there is a point ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; such that ''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. The simplest form of Brouwer's theorem is for continuous functions ''f'' from a [[Disk (mathematics)|disk]] ''D'' to itself. A more general form is for continuous functions from a [[Convex set|convex]] [[compactness|compact]] subset ''K'' of [[Euclidean space]] to itself.

Among hundreds of fixed point theorems,&lt;ref&gt;E.g. F &amp; V Bayart ''[http://www.bibmath.net/dico/index.php3?action=affiche&amp;quoi=./p/pointfixe.html Théorèmes du point fixe]'' on Bibm@th.net&lt;/ref&gt; Brouwer's is particularly well known, due in part to its use across numerous fields of mathematics.
In its original field, this result is one of the key theorems characterizing the topology of Euclidean spaces, along with the [[Jordan curve theorem]], the [[hairy ball theorem]] and the [[Borsuk–Ulam theorem]].&lt;ref&gt;See page 15 of: D. Leborgne ''Calcul différentiel et géométrie'' Puf (1982) ISBN 2130374956&lt;/ref&gt;
This gives it a place among the fundamental theorems of topology.&lt;ref&gt;More exactly, according to Encyclopédie Universalis: ''Il en a démontré l'un des plus beaux théorèmes, le théorème du point fixe, dont les applications et généralisations, de la théorie des jeux aux équations différentielles, se sont révélées fondamentales.'' [http://www.universalis.fr/encyclopedie/T705705/BROUWER_L.htm Luizen Brouwer] by G. Sabbagh&lt;/ref&gt; The theorem is also used for proving deep results about [[differential equation]]s and is covered in most introductory courses on [[differential geometry]].
It appears in unlikely fields such as [[game theory]]. In economics, Brouwer's fixed point theorem and its extension, the [[Kakutani fixed point theorem]], play a central role in the proof of existence of general equilibrium in market economies as developed in the 1950s by economics Nobel prize winners [[Gerard Debreu]] and [[Kenneth Arrow]].

The theorem was first studied in view of work on differential equations by the French mathematicians around [[Henri Poincaré|Poincaré]] and [[Émile Picard|Picard]].
Proving results such as the [[Poincaré–Bendixson theorem]] requires the use of topological methods.
This work at the end of the 19th century opened into several successive versions of the theorem. The general case was first proved in 1910 by [[Jacques Hadamard|Hadamard]], and then in 1912 by [[Luitzen Egbertus Jan Brouwer]].

== Statement ==
The theorem has several formulations, depending on the context in which it is used. 
The simplest is sometimes given as follows:

:;In the plane: Every [[continuous function (topology)|continuous]] function ''f'' from a [[Closed set|closed]] [[Disk (mathematics)|disk]] to itself has at least one fixed point.&lt;ref&gt;D. Violette ''[http://newton.mat.ulaval.ca/amq/bulletins/dec06/sperner.pdf Applications du lemme de Sperner pour les triangles]'' Bulletin AMQ, V. XLVI N° 4, (2006) p 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

This can be generalized to an arbitrary finite dimension:

:;In Euclidean space:Every continuous function from a [[closed ball]] of a [[Euclidean space]] to itself has a fixed point.&lt;ref&gt;Page 15 of: D. Leborgne ''Calcul différentiel et géométrie'' Puf (1982) ISBN 2130374956.&lt;/ref&gt;

A slightly more general version is as follows:&lt;ref&gt;This version follows directly from the previous one because every convex compact subset of a Euclidean space is homeomorphic to a closed ball. For details see [[convex set]].{{Failed verification|date=June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:;Convex compact set:Every continuous function ''f'' from a [[Convex set|convex]] [[Compact space|compact]] subset ''K'' of a Euclidean space to ''K'' itself has a fixed point.&lt;ref&gt;V. &amp; F. Bayart ''[http://www.bibmath.net/dico/index.php3?action=affiche&amp;quoi=./p/pointfixe.html Point fixe, et théorèmes du point fixe ]'' on Bibmath.net.&lt;/ref&gt;

An even more general form is better known under a different name:

:;[[Schauder fixed point theorem]]:Every continuous function from a convex compact subset ''K'' of a [[Banach space]] to ''K'' itself has a fixed point.&lt;ref&gt;C. Minazzo K. Rider ''[http://math1.unice.fr/~eaubry/Enseignement/M1/memoire.pdf Théorèmes du Point Fixe et Applications aux Equations Différentielles]'' Université de Nice-Sophia Antipolis.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Notes===
The function ''f'' in this theorem is not required to be [[bijective]] or even [[surjective]]. Since any closed ball in Euclidean ''n''-space is homeomorphic to the closed unit ball ''D''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, the theorem also has equivalent formulations that only state it for ''D''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.

Because the properties involved (continuity, being a fixed point) are invariant under [[homeomorphism]]s, the theorem is equivalent to forms in which the domain is required to be a closed unit ball ''D''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;. For the same reason it holds for every set that is homeomorphic to a closed ball (and therefore also [[closed set|closed]], bounded, [[connected space|connected]], [[simply connected|without holes]], etc.).

The statement of the theorem is false if formulated for the ''open'' unit disk, the set of points with distance strictly less than 1 from the origin. Consider for example the function
:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = (x+1)/2&lt;/math&gt;
which is a continuous function from the open interval (-1,1), the one-dimensional unit disk, to itself. As it shifts every point to the right, it cannot have a fixed point. (But it does have a fixed point for the closed interval [-1,1], namely f(x) = x = 1).

== Illustrations ==
The theorem has several &quot;real world&quot; illustrations. For example: take two sheets of graph paper of equal size with coordinate systems on them, lay one flat on the table and crumple up (without ripping or tearing) the other one and place it, in any fashion, on top of the first so that the crumpled paper does not reach outside the flat one. There will then be at least one point of the crumpled sheet that lies directly above its corresponding point (i.e. the point with the same coordinates) of the flat sheet. This is a consequence of the ''n'' = 2 case of Brouwer's theorem applied to the continuous map that assigns to the coordinates of every point of the crumpled sheet the coordinates of the point of the flat sheet immediately beneath it. 

Similarly: Take an ordinary map of a country, and suppose that that map is laid out on a table inside that country.  There will always be a &quot;You are Here&quot; point on the map which represents that same point in the country. 

In three dimensions the consequence of the Brouwer fixed point theorem is that no matter how much you stir a cocktail in a glass some point in the liquid will remain in exactly the same place in the glass as before you took any action, assuming that, presumably, the final position of each point is a continuous function of its original position, and that the liquid after stirring  is contained within the space originally taken up by it.

== Intuitive approach ==
=== Explanations attributed to Brouwer ===
The theorem is supposed to have originated from Brouwer's observation of a cup of coffee.&lt;ref&gt;The interest of this anecdote rests in its intuitive and didactic character, but its accuracy is dubious. As the history section shows, the origin of the theorem is not Brouwer's work. More than 20 years earlier [[Henri Poincaré]] had proved an equivalent result, and 5 years before Brouwer P.&amp;nbsp;Bohl had proved the three-dimensional case.&lt;/ref&gt;
If one stirs to dissolve a lump of sugar, it appears there is always a point without motion.
He drew the conclusion that at any moment, there is a point on the surface that is not moving.&lt;ref name=Arte&gt;Cette citation provient d'une émission de télévision : ''[http://archives.arte.tv/hebdo/archimed/19990921/ftext/sujet5.html Archimède]'', [[Arte]], 21 septembre 1999&lt;/ref&gt;
The fixed point is not necessarily the point that seems to be motionless, since the centre of the turbulence moves a little bit.
The result is not intuitive, since the original fixed point may become mobile when another fixed point appears.

Brouwer is said to have added: &quot;I can formulate this splendid result different, I take a horizontal sheet, and another identical one which I crumple, flatten and place on the other. Then a point of the crumpled sheet is in the same place as on the other sheet.&quot;&lt;ref name=Arte /&gt;
Brouwer &quot;flattens&quot; his sheet as with a flat iron, without removing the folds and wrinkles.

=== One-dimensional case ===
[[File:Théorème-de-Brouwer-dim-1.jpg|200px|right]]
In one dimension, the result is intuitive and easy to prove.  The continuous function ''f'' is defined on a closed interval [''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b''] and takes values in the same interval.  Saying that this function has a fixed point amounts to saying that its graph (black in the figure on the right) intersects that of the function defined on the same interval [''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b''] which maps ''x'' to ''x'' (green).

Intuitively, any continuous line from the left edge of the square to the right edge must necessarily intersect the green diagonal.

It is not hard to give a formal proof.  It suffices to consider the function ''g'' which maps ''x'' to ''f''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;''x''. It is ≥&amp;nbsp;0 on ''a'' and ≤&amp;nbsp;0 on&amp;nbsp;''b''.  By the [[intermediate value theorem]], ''g'' has a [[Root of a function|zero]] in [''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b'']; this zero is a fixed point.

Brouwer is said to have expressed this as follows: &quot;Instead of examining a surface, we will prove the theorem about a piece of string. Let us begin with the string in an unfolded state, then refold it. Let us flatten the refolded string. Again a point of the string has not changed its position with respect to its original position on the unfolded string.&quot;&lt;ref name=Arte /&gt;

In one dimension, Brouwer's fixed point theorem is equivalent to the [[intermediate value theorem]].

== History ==
The Brouwer fixed point theorem was one of the early achievements of [[algebraic topology]], and is the basis of more general [[fixed point theorem]]s which are important in [[functional analysis]]. The case ''n'' = 3 first was proved by [[Piers Bohl]] in 1904 (published in ''[[Journal für die reine und angewandte Mathematik]]''). It was later proved by [[Luitzen Egbertus Jan Brouwer|L. E. J. Brouwer]] in 1909. [[Jacques Hadamard]] proved the general case in 1910, and Brouwer found a different proof in 1912.  Since these early proofs were all [[Constructive proof|non-constructive]] [[indirect proof]]s, they ran contrary to Brouwer's [[intuitionist]] ideals. Methods to construct (approximations to) fixed points guaranteed by Brouwer's theorem are now known, however; see for example (Karamadian 1977) and (Istrăţescu 1981).

=== Prehistory ===
[[File:Théorème-de-Brouwer-(cond-1).jpg|thumb|right|For flows in an unbounded area, or in an area with a &quot;hole&quot;, the theorem is not applicable.]]
[[File:Théorème-de-Brouwer-(cond-2).jpg|thumb|left|The theorem applies to any disk-shaped area, where it guarantees the existence of a fixed point.]]
To understand the prehistory of Brouwer's fixed point theorem one needs to pass through [[differential equation]]s. At the end of the 19th century, the old problem&lt;ref&gt;See F. Brechenmacher ''[http://arxiv.org/abs/0704.2931 L'identité algébrique d'une pratique portée par la discussion sur l'équation à l'aide de laquelle on détermine les inégalités séculaires des planètes]'' CNRS Fédération de Recherche Mathématique du Nord-Pas-de-Calais&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[stability of the solar system]] returned into the focus of the mathematical community.&lt;ref&gt;[[Henri Poincaré]] won the [[Oscar II, King of Sweden|King of Sweden]]'s mathematical competition in 1889 for his work on the related [[three-body problem]]: [[Jacques Tits|J. Tits]] ''[http://www.culture.gouv.fr/culture/actualites/celebrations2004/poincare.htm Célébrations nationales 2004]'' Site du Ministère Culture et Communication&lt;/ref&gt;
Its solution required new methods. As noted by [[Henri Poincaré]], who worked on the [[three-body problem]], there is no hope to find an exact solution: &quot;Nothing is more proper to give us an idea of the hardness of the three-body problem, and generally of all problems of Dynamics where there is no uniform integral and the Bohlin series diverge.&quot;&lt;ref name=methodes&gt;[[Henri Poincaré|H. Poincaré]] ''Les méthodes nouvelles de la mécanique céleste'' T Gauthier-Villars, Vol 3 p 389 (1892) new edition Paris: Blanchard, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;
He also noted that the search for an approximate solution is no more efficient:
&quot;the more we seek to obtain precise approximations, the more the result will diverge towards an increasing imprecision.&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Quotation from [[Henri Poincaré|H. Poincaré]] taken from: P. A. Miquel ''[http://www.arches.ro/revue/no03/no3art03.htm La catégorie de désordre]'', on the website of l'Association roumaine des chercheurs francophones en sciences humaines&lt;/ref&gt;

He studied a question analogous to that of the surface movement in cup of coffee. What can we say, in general, about the trajectories on a surface animated by a constant [[flow (mathematics)|flow]]?&lt;ref&gt;This question was studied in: [[Henri Poincaré|H. Poincaré]] ''Sur les courbes définies par les équations différentielles'' J. de Math. V 2 (1886)&lt;/ref&gt; Poincaré discovered that the answer can be found in what we now call the [[topology|topological]] properties in the area containing the trajectory. If this area is [[compact space|compact]], i.e. both [[closed set|closed]] and [[bounded set|bounded]], then the trajectory either becomes stationary, or it approaches a [[limit cycle]].&lt;ref&gt;This follows from the [[Poincaré–Bendixson theorem]].&lt;/ref&gt; Poincaré went further; if the area is of the same kind as a disk, as is the case for the cup of coffee, there must necessarily be a fixed point. This fixed point is invariant under all functions which associate to each point of the original surface its position after a short time interval&amp;nbsp;''t''. If the area is a circular band, or if it is not closed,&lt;ref&gt;Multiplication by {{frac|1|2}} on ]0,&amp;nbsp;1[&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; has no fixed point.&lt;/ref&gt; then this is not necessarily the case.

To understand differential equations better, a new branch of mathematics was born. Poincaré called it ''analysis situs''. The French [[Encyclopædia Universalis]] defines it as the branch which &quot;treats the properties of an object that are invariant if it is deformed in any continuous way, without tearing&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;concerne les propriétés invariantes d’une figure lorsqu’on la déforme de manière continue quelconque, sans déchirure (par exemple, dans le cas de la déformation de la sphère, les propriétés corrélatives des objets tracés sur sa surface&quot;. From C. Houzel M. Paty ''[http://www.scientiaestudia.org.br/associac/paty/pdf/Paty,M_1997g-PoincareEU.pdf Poincaré, Henri (1854-1912)]'' Encyclopædia Universalis Albin Michel, Paris, 1999, p. 696-706&lt;/ref&gt; In [[1886]], Poincaré proved a result that is equivalent to Brouwer's fixed point theorem,&lt;ref&gt;Poincaré's theorem is stated in: V. I. Istratescu ''Fixed Point Theory an Introduction'' Kluwer Academic Publishers (réédition de 2001) p 113 ISBN 1402003013&lt;/ref&gt; although the connection with the subject of this article was not yet apparent.&lt;ref&gt;M.I. Voitsekhovskii ''[http://eom.springer.de/b/b017670.htm Brouwer theorem]'' Encyclopaedia of Mathematics ISBN 1402006098&lt;/ref&gt; A little later, he developed one of the fundamental tools for better understanding the analysis situs, now known as the [[fundamental group]] or sometimes the Poincaré group.&lt;ref&gt;J. Dieudonné, ''A History of Algebraic and differential Topology, 1900-1960'', pages 17-24&lt;/ref&gt; This method can be used for a very compact proof of the theorem under discussion.&lt;!-- fr.wikipedia has it in its article on the fundamental group, we don't --&gt;

Poincaré's method was analogous to that of [[Emile Picard]], a contemporary mathematician who generalized the [[Cauchy–Lipschitz theorem]].&lt;ref&gt;See for example: [[Emile Picard|E Picard]] ''[http://portail.mathdoc.fr/JMPA/PDF/JMPA_1893_4_9_A4_0.pdf Sur l'application des méthodes d'approximations successives à l'étude de certaines équations différentielles ordinaires]'' Journal de Mathématiques p 217 (1893)&lt;/ref&gt; Picard's approach is based on a result that would later be formalised by [[Banach fixed point theorem|another fixed point theorem]], named after [[Stefan Banach|Banach]]. Instead of the topological properties of the domain, this theorem uses the fact that the function in question is a [[contraction mapping|contraction]].

=== First proofs ===
[[Image:Hadamard2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Jacques Hadamard|Hadamard]] played the role of a midwife, helping Brouwer to formalize his ideas.]]
At the dawn of the 20th century, the interest in analysis situs did not stay unnoticed. However, the necessity of a theorem equivalent to the one discussed in this article was not yet evident. Piers Bohl, a Latvian mathematician, applied topological methods to the study of differential equations.&lt;ref&gt;J. J. O'Connor E. F. Robertson ''[http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Biographies/Bohl.html Piers Bohl]''&lt;/ref&gt; In 1904 he proved the three-dimensional case of our theorem, but his publication was not noticed.&lt;ref&gt;A. D. Myskis I. M. Rabinovic ''The first proof of a fixed-point theorem for a continuous mapping of a sphere into itself, given by the Latvian mathematician P G Bohl (Russian)'' Uspekhi matematicheskikh nauk (NS) Vol 10 (N° 3) (65) (1955) pp 188-192&lt;/ref&gt;

It was Brouwer, finally, who gave the theorem its first patent of nobility. His goals were different from those of Poincaré. This mathematician was inspired by the foundations of mathematics, especially [[mathematical logic]] and [[topology]]. His initial interest lay in an attempt to solve [[Hilbert's fifth problem]].&lt;ref&gt;J. J. O'Connor E. F. Robertson ''[http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Biographies/Brouwer.html Luitzen Egbertus Jan Brouwer]''&lt;/ref&gt; In 1909, during a voyage to Paris, he met [[Poincaré]], [[Jacques Hadamard|Hadamard]] and [[Émile Borel|Borel]]. The ensuing discussions convinced Brouwer of the importance of a better understanding of Euclidean spaces, and were the origin of a fruitful exchange of letters with Hadamard. For the next four years, he concentrated on the proof of certain great theorems on this question. In 1912 he proved the [[hairy ball theorem]] for the two-dimensional sphere, as well as the fact that every continuous map from the two-dimensional ball to itself has a fixed point.&lt;ref&gt;H. Freudenthal ''The cradle of modern topology, according to Brouwer's inedita'' Hist. Math. 2 p 495 (1975)&lt;/ref&gt; These two results in themselves were not really new. As Hadamard observed, Poincaré had shown a theorem equivalent to the hairy ball theorem.&lt;ref&gt;Freudenthal explains: &quot;... cette dernière propriété, bien que sous des hypothèses plus grossières, ait été démontré par H. Poincaré&quot; H. Freudenthal ''The cradle of modern topology, according to Brouwer's inedita'' Hist. Math. 2 p 495 (1975)&lt;/ref&gt; The revolutionary aspect of Brouwer's approach was his systematic use of recently developed tools such as [[homotopy]], the underlying concept of the Poincaré group. In the following year, Hadamard generalised the theorem under discussion to an arbitrary finite dimension, but he employed different methods. H.&amp;nbsp;Freudenthal comments on the respective roles as follows: &lt;!-- NON-LITERAL QUOTATION! translated back from French --&gt;&quot;Compared to Brouwer's revolutionary methods, those of Hadamard were very traditional, but Hadamard's participation in the birth of Brouwer's ideas resembles that of a midwife more than that of a mere spectator.&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;H. Freudenthal ''The cradle of modern topology, according to Brouwer's inedita'' Hist. Math. 2 p 501 (1975)&lt;/ref&gt;

Brouwer's approach yielded its fruits, and in 1912 he also found a proof that was valid for any finite dimension.,&lt;ref&gt;[[Luitzen Egbertus Jan Brouwer|L. E. J. Brouwer]] ''[http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF01456931 Über Abbildungen von Mannigfaltigkeiten]'' Mathematische Annalen 71, pp. 97-115 (1912)&lt;/ref&gt; as well as other key theorems such as the invariance of dimension.&lt;ref&gt;If an open subset of a [[manifold]] is [[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] to an open subset of a Euclidean space of dimension ''n'', and if ''p'' is a positive integer other than ''n'', then the open set is never homeomorphic to an open subset of a Euclidean space of dimension ''p''.&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of this work, Brouwer also generalized the [[Jordan curve theorem]] to arbitrary dimension and established the properties connected with the [[degree of a continuous mapping]].&lt;ref&gt;J. J. O'Connor E. F. Robertson ''[http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Biographies/Brouwer.html Luitzen Egbertus Jan Brouwer]''.&lt;/ref&gt; This branch of mathematics, originally envisioned by Poincaré and developed by Brouwer, changed its name. In the 1930s, analysis situs became [[algebraic topology]].&lt;ref&gt;The term ''algebraic topology'' first appeared 1931 under the pen of David van Dantzig: J. Miller ''[http://jeff560.tripod.com/t.html Topological algebra]'' on the site Earliest Known Uses of Some of the Words of Mathematics (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

Brouwer's celebrity is not exclusively due to his topological work. He was also the originator and zealous defender of a way of formalising mathematics that is known as [[intuitionistic logic|intuitionism]], which at the time made a stand against [[set theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Later it would be shown that the formalism that was combatted by Brouwer can also serve to formalise intuitionism. For further details see [[intuitionistic logic]].&lt;/ref&gt; While Brouwer preferred [[constructive proof]]s, ironically, the original proofs of his great topological theorems were not constructive,&lt;ref&gt;For a long explanation, see: J.P. Dubucs''[http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/rhs_0151-4105_1988_num_41_2_4094 L.J.E. Brouwer : Topologie et constructivisme ]'' Revue d’histoire des sciences V. 41 N°41-2 pp 133-155 (1988)&lt;/ref&gt; and it took until 1967 for constructive proofs to be found.&lt;ref&gt;H. Scarf found the first algorithmic proof: M.I. Voitsekhovskii ''[http://eom.springer.de/b/b017670.htm Brouwer theorem]'' Encyclopaedia of Mathematics ISBN 1402006098.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reception===
[[Image:John f nash 20061102 2.jpg|thumb|220px|left|[[John Forbes Nash|John Nash]] used the theorem in [[game theory]] to prove the existence of a winning strategy.]]
The theorem proved its worth in more than one way. During the 20th century numerous fixed point theorems were developed, and even a branch of mathematics called fixed point theory.&lt;ref&gt;V. I. Istratescu ''Fixed Point Theory. An Introduction'' Kluwer Academic Publishers (new edition 2001) ISBN 1402003013.&lt;/ref&gt;
Brouwer's theorem is probably the most important.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;... Brouwer's fixed point theorem, perhaps the most important fixed point theorem.&quot; p xiii V. I. Istratescu ''Fixed Point Theory an Introduction'' Kluwer Academic Publishers (new edition 2001) ISBN 1402003013.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also among the foundational theorems on the topology of [[topological manifold]]s and is often used to prove other important results such as the [[Jordan curve theorem]].&lt;ref&gt;E.g.: S. Greenwood J. Cao'' [http://www.math.auckland.ac.nz/class750/section5.pdf Brouwer’s Fixed Point Theorem and the Jordan Curve Theorem]'' University of Auckland, New Zealand.&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides the fixed point theorems for more or less [[contraction mapping|contracting]] functions, there are many that have emerged directly or indirectly from the result under discussion. A continuous map from a closed ball of Euclidean space to its boundary cannot be the identity on the boundary. Similarly, the [[Borsuk–Ulam theorem]] says that a continuous map from the ''n''-dimensional sphere to '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; has a pair of antipodal points that are mapped to the same point. In the finite-dimensional case, the [[Lefschetz fixed point theorem]] provided from 1926 a method for counting fixed points. In 1930, Brouwer's fixed point theorem was generalized to [[Banach space]]s.&lt;ref&gt;J. Schauder ''Der Fixpunktsatz in Funktionalraumen'' Studia. Math. 2 (1930)
pp 171-180&lt;/ref&gt; This generalization is known as [[Fixed point theorems in infinite-dimensional spaces|Schauder's fixed point theorem]], a result generalized further by S. Kakutani to [[multivalued function]]s.&lt;ref&gt;S. Kakutani ''A generalization of Brouwer’s Fixed Point Theorem'' Duke Math. Journal 8 (1941) pp 457-459&lt;/ref&gt; One also meets the theorem and its variants outside topology. It can be used to prove the [[Hartman-Grobman theorem]], which describes the qualitative behaviour of certain differential equations near certain equilibria. Similarly, Brouwer's theorem is used for the proof of the [[théorème de la variété centrale]].&lt;!-- This is a redlink in French, and I have no idea what it is supposed to be--&gt; The theorem can also be found in existence proofs for the solutions of certain [[partial differential equation]]s.&lt;ref&gt;These examples are taken from: F. Boyer ''[http://www.cmi.univ-mrs.fr/~fboyer/ter_fboyer2.pdf Théorèmes de point fixe et applications]'' CMI Université Paul Cézanne (2008-2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

Other areas are also touched. In [[game theory]], [[John Forbes Nash|John Nash]] used the theorem to prove that in the game of [[Hex (board game)|Hex]] there is a winning strategy for white.&lt;ref&gt;For context and references see the article [[Hex (board game)]].&lt;/ref&gt; In economy, P. Bich explains that certain generalizations of the theorem show that its use is helpful for certain classical problems in game theory and generally for equilibria ([[Hotelling's law]]), financial equilibria and incomplete markets.&lt;ref&gt;P. Bich ''[http://www.ann.jussieu.fr/~plc/code2007/bich.pdf Une extension discontinue du théorème du point fixe de Schauder, et quelques applications en économie]'' Institut Henri Poincaré, Paris (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Proof outlines ==
===A  proof using homology===

The proof uses the observation that the [[boundary (topology)|boundary]] of ''D''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is ''S''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;''n''&amp;thinsp;&amp;minus;&amp;thinsp;1&lt;/sup&gt;, the (''n'' &amp;minus; 1)-[[sphere]].

[[Image:Brouwer fixed point theorem retraction.svg|thumb|right|Illustration of the retraction ''F'']]
The argument proceeds by contradiction, supposing that a continuous function ''f''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;''D''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''D''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; has ''no'' fixed point, and then attempting to derive an inconsistency, which proves that the function must in fact have a fixed point. For each ''x'' in ''D''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, there is only one straight line that passes through ''f''(''x'') and ''x'', because it must be the case that ''f''(''x'') and ''x'' are distinct by hypothesis (recall that ''f'' having no fixed points means that ''f''(''x'') ≠ ''x''). Following this line from ''f''(''x'') through ''x'' leads to a point on ''S''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;''n''&amp;thinsp;&amp;minus;&amp;thinsp;1&lt;/sup&gt;, denoted by ''F''(''x''). This defines a continuous function ''F''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;''D''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''S''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;''n''&amp;thinsp;&amp;minus;&amp;thinsp;1&lt;/sup&gt;, which is a special type of continuous function known as a [[retract]]ion: every point of the [[codomain]] (in this case ''S''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;''n''&amp;thinsp;&amp;minus;&amp;thinsp;1&lt;/sup&gt;) is a fixed point of the function. 

Intuitively it seems unlikely that there could be a retraction of ''D''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; onto ''S''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;''n''&amp;thinsp;&amp;minus;&amp;thinsp;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and in the case ''n'' = 1 it is obviously impossible because ''S''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;0&lt;/sup&gt; (i.e., the endpoints of the closed interval ''D''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;1&lt;/sup&gt;) is not even connected. The case ''n'' = 2 is less obvious, but can be proven by using basic arguments involving the [[fundamental group]]s of the respective spaces: the retraction would induce an injective [[group homomorphism]] from the fundamental group of ''S''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;1&lt;/sup&gt; to that of ''D''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;2&lt;/sup&gt;, but the first group is isomorphic to '''Z''' while the latter group is trivial, so this is impossible. The case ''n'' = 2 can also be proven by contradiction based on a theorem about non-vanishing [[vector field]]s. 

For ''n'' &gt; 2, however, proving the impossibility of the retraction is more difficult. One way is to make use of [[Homology (mathematics)|homology groups]]:  the homology ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&amp;thinsp;&amp;minus;&amp;thinsp;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''D''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;) is trivial, while ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&amp;thinsp;&amp;minus;&amp;thinsp;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''S''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;thinsp;&amp;minus;&amp;thinsp;1&lt;/sup&gt;) is infinite [[cyclic group|cyclic]]. This shows that the retraction is impossible, because again the retraction would induce an injective group homomorphism from the latter to the former group.

===A proof using Stokes's theorem===

To prove that a map has fixed points, one can assume that it is smooth, because if a map has no fixed points then convoluting it with a smooth function of sufficiently small support produced a smooth function with no fixed points. As in the proof using homology, one is reduced to proving that there is no smooth retraction ''f'' from the ball ''B'' onto its boundary ''dB''. If ω is a volume form on the boundary then
:&lt;math&gt;0&lt;\int_{dB}\omega = \int_{dB}f^*(\omega) = \int_Bdf^*(\omega)= \int_Bf^*(d\omega)=\int_Bf^*(0) = 0&lt;/math&gt;
giving a contradiction. 

More generally, this shows that there is no smooth retraction from any non-empty smooth orientable compact manifold onto its boundary. The proof using Stokes's theorem is closely related to the proof using homology (or rather cohomology), because the form ω generates the de Rham cohomology group ''H''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''dB'') used in the cohomology proof.

===A combinatorial proof===

There is also a more elementary [[combinatorial proof]], whose main step consists in establishing [[Sperner's lemma]] in ''n'' dimensions.

===A proof by Hirsch===
There is also a quick proof, by [[Morris Hirsch]], based on the impossibility of a differentiable retraction.  The [[indirect proof]] starts by noting that the map ''f'' can be approximated by a smooth map retaining the property of not fixing a point; this can be done by using the [[Weierstrass approximation theorem]], for example.  One then defines a retraction as above which must now be differentiable.  Such a retraction must have a non-singular value, by [[Sard's theorem]], which is also non-singular for the restriction to the boundary (which is just the identity).  Thus the inverse image would be a 1-manifold with boundary. The boundary would have to contain at least two end points, both of which would have to lie on the boundary of the original ball&amp;mdash;which is impossible in a retraction.

Kellogg, Li, and Yorke turned Hirsch's proof into a constructive proof by observing that the retract is in fact defined everywhere except at the fixed points. For almost any point, q, on the boundary, (assuming it is not a fixed point) the one manifold with boundary mentioned above does exist and the only possibility is that it leads from q to a fixed point. It is an easy numerical task to follow such a path from q to the fixed point so the method is essentially constructive. Chow, Mallet-Paret, and Yorke gave a conceptually similar path-following version of the homotopy proof which extends to a wide variety of related problems.

===A proof using the game hex===
A quite different proof given by [[David Gale]] is based on the game of [[Hex (board game)|Hex]].  The basic theorem about Hex is that no game can end in a draw.  This is equivalent to the Brouwer fixed point theorem for dimension 2.  By considering ''n''-dimensional versions of Hex, one can prove in general that Brouwer's theorem is equivalent to the [[determinacy]] theorem for Hex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=David Gale |year=1979|title=The Game of Hex and Brouwer Fixed-Point Theorem | journal=The American Mathematical Monthly | volume=86 | pages=818–827|doi=10.2307/2320146|url=http://jstor.org/stable/2320146|issue=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===A proof using the Lefschetz fixed point theorem===
The Lefschetz fixed point theorem says that if a continuous map ''f'' from a finite simplicial complex ''B'' to itself has only isolated fixed points, then the number of fixed points counted with multiplicities (which may be negative) is equal to the Lefschetz number 
:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \sum_n(-1)^nTr(f|H_n(B))&lt;/math&gt;
and in particular if the Lefschetz number is nonzero then ''f'' must have a fixed point. If ''B'' is a ball (or more generally is contractible) then the Lefschetz number is one because the only non-zero homology group is ''H''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;(''B''), so ''f'' has a fixed point.

=== A proof in a weak logical system===

In [[reverse mathematics]], Brouwer's theorem can be proved in the system [[Weak Konig's lemma|WKL&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;]], and conversely over the base system [[reverse mathematics|RCA&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;]] Brouwer's theorem for a square implies the [[weak Konig's lemma]], so this gives a precise description of the strength of Brouwer's theorem.

The Brouwer fixed point theorem forms the starting point of a number of more general [[fixed point theorem]]s. 

The straightforward generalization to infinite dimensions, i.e. using the unit ball of an arbitrary [[Hilbert space]] instead of Euclidean space, is not true. The main problem here is that the unit balls of infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces are not [[compact space|compact]]. For example, in the Hilbert space [[Lp space|&amp;#8467;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]] of square-summable real (or complex) sequences, consider the map ''f'' : &amp;#8467;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; → &amp;#8467;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; which sends a sequence (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) from the closed unit ball of &amp;#8467;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; to the sequence (''y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) defined by 
:&lt;math&gt;y_0=\sqrt{1-\|x\|_2^2}\qquad\mbox{ and }\qquad y_n=x_{n-1}\quad\mbox{ for }\quad n\geq 1.&lt;/math&gt;
It is not difficult to check that this map is continuous, has its image in the unit sphere of &amp;#8467;&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;2&lt;/sup&gt;, but does not have a fixed point.

The generalizations of the Brouwer fixed point theorem to infinite dimensional spaces therefore all include a compactness assumption of some sort, and in addition also often an assumption of [[Convex set|convexity]]. See [[fixed point theorems in infinite-dimensional spaces]] for a discussion of these theorems.

There is also finite-dimensional generalization to a larger class of spaces: If &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a product of finitely many chainable continua, then every continuous function &lt;math&gt;f:X\rightarrow X&lt;/math&gt; has a fixed point,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Eldon Dyer |year=1956|title=A fixed point theorem | journal=Proceedings of the American Mathematical Society| volume=7 | pages=662–672|doi=10.1090/S0002-9939-1956-0078693-4|url=http://www.ams.org/journals/proc/1956-007-04/S0002-9939-1956-0078693-4/home.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; where a chainable continuum is a (usually but in this case not necessarily [[Metric space|metric]]) [[Compact space|compact]] [[Hausdorff space]] of which every [[open cover]] has a finite open refinement &lt;math&gt;\{U_1,\ldots,U_m\}&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;U_i \cap U_j \neq \emptyset&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;|i-j| \leq 1&lt;/math&gt;. Examples of chainable continua include compact connected linearly ordered spaces and in particular closed intervals of real numbers.

The [[Kakutani fixed point theorem]] generalizes the Brouwer fixed point theorem in a different direction: it stays in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, but considers upper [[semi-continuous]] [[correspondence (mathematics)|correspondences]] (functions that assign to each point of the set a subset of the set). It also requires compactness and convexity of the set.

The [[Lefschetz fixed-point theorem]] applies to (almost) arbitrary compact topological spaces, and gives a condition in terms of [[singular homology]] that guarantees the existence of fixed points; this condition is trivially satisfied for any map in the case of ''D''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.

'''Benzoic acid''', C&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (or C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;COOH), is a colorless crystalline solid and the simplest [[aromatic]] [[carboxylic acid]]. The name derived from [[gum benzoin]], which was for a long time the only source for benzoic acid. Its salts are used as a food preservative and benzoic acid is an important precursor for the synthesis of many other organic substances.

== History ==
Benzoic acid was discovered in the sixteenth century. The [[dry distillation]] of [[gum benzoin]]  first described by [[Nostradamus]] (1556), and subsequently by [[Alexius Pedemontanus]] (1560) and [[Blaise de Vigenère]] (1596).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author= Neumüller O-A | year = 1988| title = Römpps Chemie-Lexikon| edition = 6| publisher = Frankh'sche Verlagshandlung | location = Stuttgart| isbn = 3-440-04516-1 | oclc= 50969944 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pioneer work in 1830 through a variety of experiences based on [[amygdalin]], obtained from [[bitter almonds]] (the fruit of [[Prunus dulcis]]) oil by [[Pierre Robiquet]] and [[Antoine Boutron-Charlard]], two French chemists, had produced  [[benzaldehyde]] &lt;ref&gt;''Nouvelles expériences sur les amandes amères et sur l'huile volatile qu'elles fournissent'' Robiquet, Boutron-Charlard, Annales de chimie et de physique, 44 (1830), 352–382,&lt;/ref&gt; but they failed in working out a proper interpretation of the structure of amygdalin that would account for it, and thus missed the identification of the [[benzoyl]] radical  C&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;O.
This last step was achieved some few months later (1832) by [[Justus von Liebig]] and [[Friedrich Wöhler]], who determined the composition of benzoic acid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
| author= [[Justus von Liebig|Liebig J]], [[Friedrich Wöhler|Wöhler F]]
| title=Untersuchungen über das Radikal der Benzoesäure
| journal = [[Liebigs Annalen|Annalen der Chemie]],
| year = 1832
| volume = 3
| pages = 249–282
| doi = 10.1002/jlac.18320030302}}&lt;/ref&gt; These latter also investigated how [[hippuric acid]] is related to benzoic acid.

In 1875 Salkowski discovered the [[antifungal]] abilities of benzoic acid, which was used for a long time in the preservation of benzoate-containing [[Cloudberry|cloudberry fruits]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author= Salkowski E| title= | journal=Berl Klin Wochenschr| year=1875 | volume=12 | pages=297–298}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Production ==
=== Industrial preparations ===
Benzoic acid is produced commercially by partial oxidation of [[toluene]] with [[oxygen]]. The process is catalyzed by [[cobalt]] or [[manganese]] [[naphthenate]]s. The process uses cheap raw materials, proceeds in high yield, and is considered environmentally green.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

:[[Image:Benzoic acid-chemical-synthesis-1.png|220px|toluene oxidation]]

U.S. production capacity is estimated to be 126,000 [[tonne]]s per year (139,000 tons), much of which is consumed domestically to prepare other industrial chemicals.

=== Laboratory synthesis ===

Benzoic acid is cheap and readily available, so the laboratory synthesis of benzoic acid is mainly practiced for its pedagogical value. It is a common undergraduate preparation.

For all syntheses, benzoic acid can be purified by recrystallization from water because of its high solubility in hot water and poor solubility in cold water. The avoidance of organic solvents for the recrystallization makes this experiment particularly safe. Other possible recrystallization solvents include [[acetic acid]] ([[anhydrous]] or aqueous), [[benzene]], petroleum ether, and a mixture of ethanol and water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Purification of Laboratory Chemicals | edition = 3rd | author = D. D. Perrin; W. L. F. Armarego | publisher = Pergamon Press | pages = 94 | year = 1988 | isbn = 0-08-034715-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== By hydrolysis ====

Like any other [[nitrile]] or [[amide]], [[benzonitrile]] and [[benzamide]] can be hydrolyzed to benzoic acid or its conjugate base in acid or basic conditions.

==== From benzaldehyde ====

The base-induced [[disproportionation]] of [[benzaldehyde]], the [[Cannizzaro reaction]], affords equal amounts of benzoate and [[benzyl alcohol]]; the latter can be removed by [[distillation]].

[[Image:Benzaldehyde Cannizzaro reaction.png|400px]]

==== From bromobenzene ====

[[Bromobenzene]] can be converted to benzoic acid by &quot;carbonation&quot; of the intermediate [[phenylmagnesium bromide]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Introduction to Organic Laboratory Techniques: A Small Scale Approach | author = Donald L. Pavia | year = 2004 | publisher = Thomson Brooks/Cole | isbn = 0534408338 | pages = 312–314}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;MgBr  +  CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  →  C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;MgBr
:C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;MgBr  +  HCl  →  C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H  +  MgBrCl

==== From benzyl alcohol ====
[[Benzyl alcohol]] is refluxed with potassium permanganate or other oxidizing reagents in water. The mixture is hot filtered to remove manganese dioxide and then allowed to cool to afford benzoic acid.

====From benzyl chloride====
Benzoic acid (C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;COOH) can be prepared by oxidation of [[benzyl chloride]] in the presence of alkaline KMnO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;

:C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl  +  2 KOH  +  2 [O]  →  C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;COOK  +  KCl  +  H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

==== Historical preparation ====
The first industrial process involved the reaction of [[benzotrichloride]] (trichloromethyl benzene) with [[calcium hydroxide]] in water, using [[iron]] or [[Iron(III) chloride|iron salts]] as [[catalyst]]. The resulting [[calcium benzoate]] is converted to benzoic acid with [[hydrochloric acid]]. The product contains significant amounts of chlorinated benzoic acid derivatives. For this reason, benzoic acid for human consumption was obtained by dry distillation of gum benzoin. Food-grade benzoic acid is now produced synthetically.

== Uses ==
=== Feedstock ===
Benzoic acid is used to make a large number of chemicals; important examples of which are:
*[[Benzoyl chloride]], C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;C(O)Cl, is obtained by treatment of benzoic with [[thionyl chloride]], [[phosgene]] or one of the [[phosphorus chlorides|chlorides of phosphorus]]. C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;C(O)Cl is an important starting material for several benzoic acid derivates like [[benzyl benzoate]], which is used in [[Flavouring|artificial flavours]] and [[insect repellent]]s.
*Benzoate [[plasticizer]]s, such as the glycol-, diethylengylcol-, and triethyleneglycol esters, are obtained by [[transesterification]] of [[methyl benzoate]] with the corresponding [[diol]]. Alternatively these species arise by treatment of benzoylchloride with the diol. These plasticizers are used similarly to those derived from terephthalic acid ester.
*[[Phenol]], C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;OH, is obtained by oxidative [[decarboxylation]] at 300-400°C. The temperature required can be lowered to 200°C by the addition of catalytic amounts of [[copper|copper(II) salts]]. The phenol can be converted to [[cyclohexanol]], which is a starting material for [[nylon]] synthesis.

=== Food preservative ===
Benzoic acid and its salts are used as a food [[preservative]], represented by the [[E-numbers]] [[E210]], [[sodium benzoate|E211]], [[potassium benzoate|E212]], and [[calcium benzoate|E213]]. Benzoic acid inhibits the growth of [[mold]], [[yeast]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | unused_data=DUPLICATE DATA: date=12 January 1991 | author=A D Warth | title= Mechanism of action of benzoic acid on Zygosaccharomyces bailii: effects on glycolytic metabolite levels, energy production, and [[intracellular pH]] | journal=Appl Environ Microbiol. 1991 December| date=1 December 1991| url=http://aem.asm.org/cgi/content/abstract/57/12/3410 | volume=1|pages=1 | pmid= 1785916 | issue=12 | pmc=183988 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and some [[bacteria]]. It is either added directly or created from reactions with its [[sodium]], [[potassium]], or [[calcium]] salt. The mechanism starts with the absorption of benzoic acid in to the cell. If the intracellular [[pH]] changes to 5 or lower, the [[Fermentation (biochemistry)|anaerobic fermentation]] of [[glucose]] through [[phosphofructokinase]] is decreased by 95%. The efficacy of benzoic acid and benzoate is thus dependent on the pH of the food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Pastrorova I, de Koster CG, Boom JJ | title= Analytic Study of Free and Ester Bound Benzoic and Cinnamic Acids of Gum Benzoin Resins by GC-MS HPLC-frit FAB-MS | journal=Phytochem Anal | year=1997 | volume=8|pages=63–73 |doi= 10.1002/(SICI)1099-1565(199703)8:2&lt;63::AID-PCA337&gt;3.0.CO;2-Y }}&lt;/ref&gt; Acidic food and beverage like [[fruit juice]] ([[citric acid]]), sparkling drinks ([[carbon dioxide]]), [[soft drinks]] ([[phosphoric acid]]), [[Pickling|pickles]] ([[vinegar]]) or other acidified food are preserved with benzoic acid and benzoates.

Typical levels of use for benzoic acid as a preservative in food are between 0.05 – 0.1%. Foods in which benzoic acid may be used and maximum levels for its application are laid down in international food law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.codexalimentarius.net/gsfaonline/groups/details.html?id=162 GSFA Online Food Additive Group Details: Benzoates (2006)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://europa.eu.int/eur-lex/en/consleg/pdf/1995/en_1995L0002_do_001.pdf EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND COUNCIL DIRECTIVE No 95/2/EC of 20 February 1995 on food additives other than colours and sweeteners (Consleg-versions do not contain the latest changes in a law)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Concern has been expressed that benzoic acid and its salts may react with [[ascorbic acid]] (vitamin C) in some soft drinks, forming small quantities of [[benzene]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bfr.bund.de/cm/245/indications_of_the_possible_formation_of_benzene_from_benzoic_acid_in_foods.pdf BfR article&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|Benzene in soft drinks}}

=== Medicinal ===
Benzoic acid is a constituent of [[Whitfield's Ointment]] which is used for the treatment of fungal skin diseases such as tinea, [[ringworm]], and [[athlete's foot]].
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medipharmalimited.com/whitfield_ointment.asp Whitfield Ointment&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Wilson and Gisvold's Textbook of Organic Medicinal and Pharmaceutical | author = Charles Owens Wilson; Ole Gisvold; John H. Block | year = 2004 | publisher = Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins | isbn = 0781734819 | pages = 234}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As the principal component of [[Benzoin resin]], benzoic acid is also a major ingredient in both [[Tincture of Benzoin]] and [[Friar's Balsam]].  Such products have a long history of use as topical [[antiseptics]] and inhalant [[decongestants]].

== Biology and health effects ==
Benzoic acid occurs naturally free and bound as benzoic acid esters in many plant and animal species. Appreciable amounts have been found in most berries (around 0.05%). Ripe fruits of several ''[[Vaccinium]]'' species (e.g., [[cranberry]], ''V. vitis idaea''; [[bilberry]], ''V. macrocarpon'') contain as much as 0.03-0.13% free benzoic acid. Benzoic acid is also formed in [[apple]]s after infection with the fungus ''[[Nectria galligena]]''.
Among animals, benzoic acid has been identified primarily in omnivorous or phytophageous species, e.g., in viscera and muscles of the [[Rock Ptarmigan]] (''Lagopus muta'') as well as in gland secretions of male [[muskoxen]] (''Ovibos moschatus'') or Asian bull elephants (''[[Elephas maximus]]'').&lt;ref name = &quot;concise&quot; /&gt;

[[Gum benzoin]] contains up to 20% of benzoic acid and 40% benzoic acid esters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author= Tomokuni K, Ogata M| title=Direct Colorimetric Determination of Hippuric Acid in Urine| journal=Clin Chem | year=1972 | pages=349–351| volume=18| pmid= 5012256| issue= 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Benzoic acid is present as part of [[hippuric acid]] (N-Benzoylglycine) in [[urine]] of [[mammals]], especially [[herbivores]] (Gr. ''hippos'' = horse; ''ouron'' = urine). Humans produce about 0.44 g/L [[hippuric acid]] per day in their urine, and if the person is exposed to [[toluene]] or benzoic acid it can rise above that level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Krebs HA, Wiggins D, Stubbs M | title= Studies on the mechanism of the antifungal action of benzoate | journal= Biochem J | year=1983 | volume=214 | pages=657–663| url = http://www.biochemj.org/bj/214/0657/2140657.pdf | pmid=6226283 | issue=3 | pmc=1152300 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Taipei]], Taiwan, a city health survey in 2010 found 30% of tested dried and pickled food products failed a test having too much benzoic acid, which is known to affect the liver and kidney,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/national/national-news/2010/01/18/241326/Nearly-30.htm&lt;/ref&gt; along with more serious issues like excessive [[cyclamate]].

== Chemistry ==
Reactions of benzoic acid can occur at either the [[aromaticity|aromatic ring]] or the [[carboxyl group]]:

===Aromatic ring===
:[[Image:Benzoic acid-chemical-reaction-1.png|440px|benzoic acid aromatic ring reactions]]

[[Electrophilic aromatic substitution]] reaction will take place mainly in 3-position due to the [[deactivating group|electron-withdrawing]] [[carboxylic group]]; i.e. benzoic acid is [[electrophilic aromatic substitution#Meta directors|''meta'' directing]].

The second substitution reaction (on the right) is slower because the first nitro group is deactivating.&lt;ref&gt;{{OrgSynth | author=Brewster, R. Q.; Williams, B.; Phillips, R. |title=3,5-Dinitrobenzoic Acid| | collvol = 3 | collvolpages = 337 | year= 1955 | prep = cv3p0337}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, if an activating group (electron-donating) was introduced (e.g., alkyl), a second substitution reaction would occur more readily than the first and the disubstituted product might not accumulate to a significant extent.

=== Carboxyl group ===

All the reactions mentioned for [[carboxylic acid]]s are also possible for benzoic acid.

* Benzoic acid [[esters]] are the product of the acid catalysed reaction with [[alcohols]].
* Benzoic acid [[amide]]s are more easily available by using activated acid derivatives (such as [[benzoyl chloride]]) or by coupling reagents used in [[peptide synthesis]] like [[Dicyclohexylcarbodiimide|DCC]] and [[DMAP]].
* The more active benzoic [[acid anhydride|anhydride]] is formed by dehydration using [[acetic anhydride]] or [[phosphorus pentoxide]].
* Highly reactive acid derivatives such as [[Acyl halide|acid halides]] are easily obtained by mixing with [[halogenation]] agents like [[phosphorus chlorides]] or [[thionyl chloride]].
* [[Orthoester]]s can be obtained by the reaction of alcohols under acidic water free conditions with [[benzonitrile]].
* Reduction to [[benzaldehyde]] and [[benzyl alcohol]] is possible using [[DIBAL-H]], [[lithium aluminium hydride|LiAlH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]] or [[sodium borohydride]].
* The copper catalysed [[decarboxylation]] of [[benzoate]] to benzene may be effected by heating in [[quinoline]]. Also, Hunsdiecker decarboxylation can be achieved by forming the silver salt and heating.

In [[chemistry]], [[physics]], and [[mathematics]], the '''Boltzmann distribution''' is a certain [[distribution function]] or [[probability measure]] for the distribution of the states of a system. It underpins the concept of the [[canonical ensemble]], providing its underlying distribution. A special case of the Boltzmann distribution, used for describing the velocities of particles of a gas, is the [[Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution]]. In more general mathematical settings, the Boltzmann distribution is also known as the [[Gibbs measure]].

The Boltzmann distribution for the fractional  number of particles ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;''N'' occupying a set of states ''i'' possessing energy ''E&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is:

:&lt;math&gt;{N_i \over N} = {g_i e^{-E_i/(k_BT)} \over Z(T)}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;k_B&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Boltzmann constant]], ''T'' is temperature (assumed to be a well-defined quantity), &lt;math&gt;g_i&lt;/math&gt; is the degeneracy (meaning, the number of levels having energy &lt;math&gt;E_i&lt;/math&gt;)(sometimes, the more general 'states' are used instead of levels, to avoid using degeneracy in the equation), ''N'' is the total number of particles and ''Z''(''T'') is the [[partition function (statistical mechanics)|partition function]].

:&lt;math&gt;N=\sum_i N_i,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;Z(T)=\sum_i g_i e^{-E_i/(k_BT)}.&lt;/math&gt;

Alternatively, for a single system at a well-defined temperature, it gives the [[probability]] that the system is in the specified state. The Boltzmann distribution applies only to particles at a high enough temperature and low enough density that quantum  effects can be ignored, and the particles are obeying [[Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics]]. (See that article for a derivation of the Boltzmann distribution.)

The Boltzmann distribution is often expressed in terms of β = 1/''kT'' where β is referred to as [[thermodynamic beta]].  The term &lt;math&gt;e^{-\beta E_i}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;e^{-E_i/(kT)}&lt;/math&gt;, which gives the (unnormalised) relative probability of a state, is called the [[Boltzmann factor]] and appears often in the study of physics and chemistry.

When the energy is simply the [[kinetic energy]] of the particle

:&lt;math&gt;E_i = \begin{matrix} \frac{1}{2} \end{matrix} mv^2,&lt;/math&gt;

then the distribution correctly gives the [[Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution]] of gas molecule speeds, previously predicted by [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]] in 1859.  The Boltzmann distribution is, however, much more general. For example, it also predicts the variation of the particle density in a gravitational field with height, if &lt;math&gt;E_i = \begin{matrix} \frac{1}{2} \end{matrix} mv^2 + mgh&lt;/math&gt;.  In fact the distribution applies whenever quantum considerations can be ignored.

In some cases, a continuum approximation can be used. If there are ''g''(''E'')&amp;nbsp;''dE'' states with energy ''E'' to ''E''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''dE'', then the Boltzmann distribution predicts a probability distribution for the energy:

:&lt;math&gt;p(E)\,dE = {g(E) e^{-\beta E} \over \int g(E') e^{-\beta E'}\,dE'}\, dE.&lt;/math&gt;

Then ''g''(''E'') is called the [[density of states]] if the energy spectrum is continuous.

Classical particles with this energy distribution are said to obey [[Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics]].

In the classical limit, i.e.  at large values of &lt;math&gt;E/(kT)&lt;/math&gt; or at small [[density of states]] &amp;mdash; when wave functions of particles practically do not overlap &amp;mdash; both the [[Bose–Einstein statistics|Bose–Einstein]] or [[Fermi–Dirac]] distribution become the Boltzmann distribution.

'''Leg theory''' is a [[bowling (cricket)|bowling]] tactic in the [[sport]] of [[cricket]]. The term ''leg theory'' is somewhat archaic and seldom used any more, but the basic tactic still plays a part in modern cricket.

Simply put, leg theory involves concentrating the bowling attack at or near the [[line and length|line]] of [[stump (cricket)|leg stump]]. This may or may not be accompanied by a concentration of [[fielding positions in cricket|fielders]] on the [[leg side]]. The line of attack aims to cramp the [[batsman]], making him play the [[cricket ball|ball]] with the [[cricket bat|bat]] close to the body. This makes it difficult to hit the ball freely and score runs, especially on the [[Fielding (cricket)#Off and leg side fields|off side]]. Since a leg theory attack means the batsman is more likely to hit the ball on the leg side, additional fielders on that side of the field can be effective in preventing runs and taking catches.

Stifling the batsman in this manner can lead to impatience and frustration, resulting in rash play by the batsman which in turn can lead to a quick dismissal.

Leg theory can be a moderately successful tactic when used with both [[fast bowling]] and [[spin bowling]], particularly [[leg spin]] to right-handed batsmen or [[off spin]] to left-handed batsmen. However, because it relies on lack of concentration or discipline by the batsman, it can be risky against patient and skilled players, especially batsmen who are strong on the leg side. The English opening bowlers [[Sydney Barnes]] and [[Frank Foster (cricketer)|Frank Foster]] used leg theory with some success in Australia in 1911-12. In England, at around the same time [[Fred Root]] was one of the main proponents of the same tactic.

Concentrating attack on the leg stump is considered by many cricket fans and commentators to lead to boring play, as it stifles run scoring and encourages batsmen to play conservatively.

==Fast leg theory==
{{Main|Bodyline}}

In 1930, [[English cricket team|England]] captain [[Douglas Jardine]], together with [[Nottinghamshire]]'s captain [[Arthur Carr (cricketer)|Arthur Carr]] and his bowlers [[Harold Larwood]] and [[Bill Voce]], developed a variant of leg theory in which the bowlers bowled fast, short-pitched balls that would rise into the batsman's body, together with a heavily stacked ring of close fielders on the leg side. The idea was that when the batsman defended against the ball, he would be likely to deflect the ball into the air for a catch.

Jardine called this modified form of the tactic ''fast leg theory''. On the 1932-33 English tour of [[Australia]], Larwood and Voce bowled fast leg theory at the Australian batsmen. It turned out to be extremely dangerous, and most Australian players sustained injuries from being hit by the ball. [[Wicket-keeper]] [[Bert Oldfield]]'s skull was fractured by a ball hitting his head (although the ball had first glanced off the bat and Larwood had an orthodox field), almost precipitating a riot by the Australian crowd.

The Australian press dubbed the tactic ''[[Bodyline]]'', and claimed it was a deliberate attempt by the English team to intimidate and injure the Australian players. Reports of the controversy reaching England at the time described the bowling as ''fast leg theory'', which sounded to many people to be a harmless and well-established tactic. This led to a serious misunderstanding amongst the English public and the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] - the administrators of English cricket - of the dangers posed by Bodyline. The English press and cricket authorities declared the Australian protests to be a case of sore losing and &quot;squealing&quot;.

It was only with the return of the English team and the subsequent use of [[Bodyline]] against English players in England by the touring [[West Indian cricket team]] in 1933 that demonstrated to the country the dangers it posed. The MCC subsequently revised the [[Laws of Cricket]] to prevent the use of &quot;fast leg theory&quot; tactics in future, also limiting the traditional tactic.

Danner first appeared on stage with the Theater Company of Boston and the Trinity Square Repertory Company (now [[Trinity Repertory Company]]) in [[Providence, Rhode Island]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} She first gained national attention at age 25 by winning the [[Theatre World Award]] for her performance in the Lincoln Center Rep's production of ''[[The Miser]]''.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} In 1970, she appeared in her first film role, in a television production of ''Dr. Cook's Garden''.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} She was the toast of Broadway when she created the adorable ingenue in ''[[Butterflies are Free]]'' for which she won a [[Tony Award]] in 1970 (a role Goldie Hawn played in the film).{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

In 1972, Danner portrayed Martha Jefferson in the movie version of ''[[1776 (film)|1776]]''. Also that same year, she played a jilted wife opposite [[Peter Falk]] and [[John Cassavetes]] in the ''[[Columbo (TV series)|Columbo]]'' episode &quot;Etude in Black&quot;.

Her earliest starring film role was opposite [[Alan Alda]] in ''To Kill a Clown'' ([[1972 in film|1972]]). Danner appeared in the episode of ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'' entitled ''[[List of M*A*S*H episodes (Season 4)|The More I See You]]'', playing the love interest of Alda's character [[Hawkeye Pierce|Hawkeye]]. She played the role of Zelda Fitzgerald in ''The Last of the Belles'' (1974). She was the eponymous heroine in the film ''[[Lovin' Molly]]'' ([[1974 in film|1974]]) (directed by [[Sidney Lumet]]). She appeared in [[Futureworld]] playing Tracy Ballard with co-star [[Peter Fonda]] (1976). In the film version of Neil Simon's semi-autobiographical play ''[[Brighton Beach Memoirs]]'' (1986), she portrayed a middle-aged [[Jew]]ish mother, and in the 1982 TV movie ''[[Inside the Third Reich]]'', she played the wife of [[Albert Speer]]. She has appeared in two films based on the novels of [[Pat Conroy]], ''[[The Great Santini]]'' ([[1979 in film|1979]]) and ''[[The Prince of Tides]]'' ([[1991 in film|1991]]), as well as two television movies adapted from books by [[Anne Tyler]], ''[[Saint Maybe]]'' and ''[[Back When We Were Grownups]]'', both for the [[Hallmark Hall of Fame]].

Danner is more recently known for her role opposite [[Robert De Niro]] in the [[2000 in film|2000]] comedy hit ''[[Meet the Parents]]'', and its sequels, ''[[Meet the Fockers]]'' and ''[[Little Fockers]]''.

From 2001 to 2006, she regularly appeared on ''[[Will &amp; Grace]]'' as [[Will Truman]]'s mother [[Supporting characters on Will &amp; Grace#Will's family|Marilyn]].

After the passing of her husband Bruce Paltrow as a result of oral cancer, she became involved with the Oral Cancer Foundation,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oralcancer.org Oral Cancer Foundation 2007&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; a national 501(c)3 non profit charity. In 2005 she filmed a public service announcement that played on TV stations around the country about the risks associated with oral cancer, and through that shared the personal pain associated with the loss of her husband publicly to further awareness of the disease and the need for early detection. She continues to donate her time to the foundation, and has appeared on morning talk shows, and has done interviews in high profile magazines such as People to further public awareness of the disease and its risk factors. Through The Bruce Paltrow Oral Cancer Fund, administered by the Oral Cancer Foundation, she continues to raise awareness and funding for oral cancer issues, particularly those involving communities in which disparities in health care exist.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

==Personal life==
Danner is the widow of producer/director Bruce Paltrow, who died from complications of pneumonia while battling oral [[cancer]] in 2002, and the mother of actress Gwyneth Paltrow and director Jake Paltrow. Danner first co-starred with her daughter in [[1992 in film|1992]] in the TV movie ''[[Cruel Doubt]]'' and then again in the [[2003 in film|2003 film]] ''[[Sylvia (2003 film)|Sylvia]]'', playing mother to Gwyneth Paltrow's title role as Sylvia Plath.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Bioleaching''' is the extraction of specific [[metal]]s from their [[ore]]s through the use of [[living organism]]s. This is much cleaner than the traditional [[heap leaching]] using cyanide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2009/01/gold/larmer-text/5 Flotation technique cleaner than heap leaching]&lt;/ref&gt; Bioleaching is one of several applications within [[biohydrometallurgy]] and several methods are used to recover [[copper]], [[zinc]], [[lead]], [[arsenic]], [[antimony]], [[nickel]], [[molybdenum]], [[gold]], [[silver]], and [[cobalt]]. 
 
== The process ==

Bioleaching can involve numerous ferrous iron and sulfur oxidizing bacteria, including ''[[Acidithiobacillus]] ferrooxidans'' and ''Acidithiobacillus '' (formerly known as ''Thiobacillus''). As a general principle, Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ions are used to oxidize the ore. This step is entirely independent of microbes. The role of the bacteria is the further oxidation of the ore, but more importantly also the regeneration of the chemical oxidant Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; from Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. For example, bacteria [[catalyst|catalyse]] the breakdown of the mineral [[pyrite]] (FeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) by oxidising the [[sulfur]] and metal (in this case ferrous iron, (Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;)) using [[oxygen]]. This yields [[soluble]] [[product (chemistry)|products]] which can be further purified and refined to yield the desired metal.


'''[[Pyrite]] leaching''' (FeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;):
In the first step, disulfide is spontaneously oxidized to [[thiosulfate]] by ferric iron (Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;), which in turn is reduced to give ferrous iron (Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;):
:(1)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{FeS_2 + 6 \ Fe^{\,3+} + 3 \ H_2O \longrightarrow 7 \ Fe^{\,2+} + S_2O_3^{\,2-} + 6 \ H^+}&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;spontaneous

The ferrous iron is then oxidized by bacteria using oxygen:
:(2)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{4 \ Fe^{\,2+} + \ O_2 + 4 \ H^+ \longrightarrow 4 \ Fe^{\,3+} + 2 \ H_2O}&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(iron oxidizers)

Thiosulfate is also oxidized by bacteria to give sulfate:
:(3)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{S_2O_3^{\,2-} + 2 \ O_2 + H_2O \longrightarrow 2 \ SO_4^{\,2-} + 2 \ H^+}&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(sulfur oxidizers)


The ferric iron produced in reaction (2) oxidized more sulfide as in reaction (1), closing the cycle and given the net reaction:
:(4)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{2 \ FeS_2 + 7 \ O_2 + 2 \ H_2O \longrightarrow 2 \ Fe^{\,2+} + 4 \ SO_4^{\,2-} + 4 \ H^+}&lt;/math&gt; 


The net products of the reaction are soluble [[ferrous sulfate]] and [[sulfuric acid]].

The microbial oxidation process occurs at the  [[cell membrane]] of the bacteria. The [[electron]]s pass into the [[cell (biology)|cell]]s and are used in [[biochemical]] processes to produce energy for the bacteria while reducing oxygen to [[water]]. The critical reaction is the oxidation of sulfide by ferric iron. The main role of the bacterial step is the regeneration of this reactant.


The process for copper is very similar, but the efficiency and kinetics depend on the copper mineralogy. The most efficient minerals are supergene minerals such as chalcocite, Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S and Covellite, CuS. The main copper mineral [[chalcopyrite]] (CuFeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is not leached very efficiently, which is why the dominant copper producing technology remains flotation followed by smelting and refining. The leaching of CuFeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; follows the two stages of being dissolved and then further oxidised, with Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions being left in solution.


'''[[Chalcopyrite]] leaching''':
:(1)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{CuFeS_2 + 4 \ Fe^{\,3+} \longrightarrow Cu^{\,2+} + 5 \ Fe^{\,2+} + 2 \ S_0}&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;spontaneous
:(2)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{4 \ Fe^{\,2+} + O_2 + 4 \ H^+ \longrightarrow 4 \ Fe^{\,3+} + 2 \ H_2O}&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(iron oxidizers)
:(3)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{2 \ S^0 + 3 \ O_2 + 2 \ H_2O \longrightarrow 2 \ SO_4^{\,2-} + 4 \ H^+}&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(sulfur oxidizers)
net reaction:
:(4)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{CuFeS_2 + 4 \ O_2 \longrightarrow Cu^{\,2+} + Fe^{\,2+} + 2 \ SO_4^{\,2-}}&lt;/math&gt;


In general, [[sulfide]]s are first oxidized to elemental sulfur, whereas [[disulfide]]s are oxidized to give [[thiosulfate]], and the processes above can be applied to other sulfidic ores. Bioleaching of non-sulfidic ores such as [[pitchblende]] also uses ferric iron as an oxidant (e.g. UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ==&gt; UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; + 2 Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;). In this case the sole purpose of the bacterial step is the regeneration of Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;. Sulfidic [[iron ore]]s can be added to speed up the process and provide a source of iron.

== Further processing ==

The dissolved copper (Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) ions are removed from the solution by [[ligand]] exchange solvent extraction which leaves other ions in the solution. The copper is removed by bonding to a ligand, which is a large molecule consisting of a number of smaller [[functional group|groups]], each possessing a [[lone electron pair]]. The ligand-copper complex is extrcted from the solution using an [[organic compound|organic]] solvent such as [[kerosene]]:

:Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;(aq)&lt;/sub&gt; + 2LH(organic) &amp;rarr; CuL&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(organic) + 2H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;(aq)&lt;/sub&gt;

The ligand donates electrons to the copper, producing a [[complex (chemistry)|complex]] - a central metal [[atom]] (copper) bonded to the ligand. Because this complex has no [[electric charge|charge]], it is no longer attracted to [[polar molecule|polar]] water molecules and dissolves in the kerosene, which is then easily separated from the solution. Because the initial [[chemical reaction|reaction]] is [[reversible reaction|reversible]], it is determined by pH. Adding concentrated acid reverses the equation, and the copper ions go back into an aqueous solution.

Then the copper is passed through an electro-winning process to increase its purity: an electric [[Electric current|current]] is passed through the resulting solution of copper ions. Because copper ions have a 2+ charge, they are attracted to the negative [[cathode]]s and collect there.

The copper can also be concentrated and separated by [[single displacement reaction|displacing]] the copper with Fe from scrap iron:

:Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;(aq)&lt;/sub&gt; + Fe&lt;sub&gt;(s)&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;rarr; Cu&lt;sub&gt;(s)&lt;/sub&gt; + Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;(aq)&lt;/sub&gt;

The electrons lost by the iron are taken up by the copper. Copper is the oxidising agent (it accepts electrons), and iron is the reducing agent (it loses electrons).

Traces of precious metals such as gold may be left in the original solution. Treating the mixture with [[sodium cyanide]] in the presence of free oxygen dissolves the gold. The gold is removed from the solution by [[adsorption|adsorbing]] (taking it up on the surface) to [[charcoal]].

==Bioleaching with fungi==
Several species of [[fungi]] can be used for bioleaching. Fungi can be grown on many different substrates, such as [[e-waste|electronic scrap]], [[catalytic converter]]s, and [[fly ash]] from municipal waste [[incineration]]. Experiments have shown that two fungal [[strain (biology)|strains]] (''Aspergillus niger, Penicillium simplicissimum'') were able to mobilize Cu and Sn by 65%, and Al, Ni, Pb, and Zn by more than 95%.''Aspergillus niger'' can produce some organic acids such as [[citric acid]] This form of leaching does not rely on microbial oxidation of metal, but rather uses microbial metabolism as source of acids which directly dissolve the metal.

==Compared with other extraction techniques==
Extractions involve many expensive steps such as [[Roasting (metallurgy)|roasting]] and [[smelting]], which require sufficient concentrations of [[chemical element|elements]] in ores and are environmentally unfriendly. Low concentrations are not a problem for bacteria because they simply ignore the waste which surrounds the metals, attaining extraction yields of over 90% in some cases. These [[microorganism]]s actually gain [[energy]] by breaking down minerals into their constituent elements. The company simply collects the [[ion]]s out of the [[solution]] after the bacteria have finished. 

Some advantages associated with bioleaching are:

*[[Economics|economical]]: bioleaching is generally simpler and therefore cheaper to operate and maintain than traditional processes, since fewer specialists are needed to operate complex [[chemical]] [[factory|plants]].

*[[pollution|environmental]]: The process is more [[environmentally friendly]] than traditional extraction methods. For the company this can translate into profit, since the necessary limiting of [[sulfur dioxide]] [[air pollution|emissions]] during smelting is expensive. Less landscape damage occurs, since the bacteria involved grow naturally, and the mine and surrounding area can be left relatively untouched. As the bacteria [[biological reproduction|breed]] in the conditions of the mine, they are easily cultivated and [[recycling|recycled]].

Some disadvantages associated with bioleaching are:

*economical: the bacterial leaching process is very slow compared to smelting. This brings in less profit as well as introducing a significant delay in [[cash flow]] for new plants. 

*environmental: [[Toxicity|Toxic]] chemicals are sometimes produced in the process. [[Sulfuric acid]] and H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions which have been formed can leak into the [[groundwater|ground]] and surface water turning it acidic, causing environmental damage. [[Heavy ion]]s such as [[iron]], zinc, and arsenic leak during [[acid mine drainage]]. When the [[pH]] of this solution rises, as a result of [[concentration|dilution]] by fresh water, these ions [[precipitation (chemistry)|precipitate]], forming [[Acid mine drainage#Yellow boy|&quot;Yellow Boy&quot;]] pollution. For these reasons, a setup of bioleaching must be carefully planned, since the process can lead to a [[biosafety]] failure.

Currently it is more economical to smelt copper ore rather than to use bioleaching, since the concentration of copper in its ore is generally quite high. The profit obtained from the speed and yield of smelting justifies its cost. However, the concentration of gold in its ore is generally very low. The lower cost of bacterial leaching in this case outweighs the time it takes to extract the metal.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Bouldering''' is a style of [[rock climbing]] undertaken without a rope and normally limited to very short climbs over a crash pad (called a [[bouldering mat]]) so that a fall will not result in serious injury. It is typically practiced on large natural [[boulder]]s or artificial boulders in gyms and outdoor urban areas. However, it may also be practiced at the base of larger rock faces, or even on buildings or public architecture (see [[buildering]]).

==Bouldering basics==
[[Image:Bouldering.jpg|right|thumb|250px|A climber with chalked-up hands and a crash pad on the ground. (Black Mountain, [[Idyllwild-Pine Cove, California|Idyllwild, California]])]] 
Bouldering is a style of climbing emphasizing power, strength, and dynamics. Its focus is on individual moves or short sequences of moves, unlike [[traditional climbing]] or [[sport climbing]], which generally demand more endurance over longer stretches of rock where the difficulty of individual moves is not as great. Boulder routes are commonly referred to as ''problems'' (a British appellation) because the nature of the climb is often short, curious, and much like problem solving. Sometimes these problems are [[Glossary of climbing terms#E|eliminates]], meaning certain artificial restrictions are imposed. Bouldering is more focused on the technique of climbing instead of undertaking a full bodied climb.

To reduce the risk of injury from a fall, climbers rarely go higher than 3–5 meters above the ground.  Anything over 7 meters is generally considered to be [[free-soloing]] (or simply 'soloing'), although such climbs might also be termed ''high-ball'' bouldering problems. For further protection, climbers typically put a [[bouldering mat]] (crash pad) on the ground to break their fall.  Last, climbers often have one or more [[spotting (climbing)|spotters]], who work to direct the climber's body toward the crash pad during a fall, while protecting the climber's head from hazards.

Bouldering is increasing in popularity; bouldering areas are common in indoor climbing gyms and some climbing gyms are dedicated solely to bouldering. Children are joining the sport now as well as adults. In fact, studies have found that young climbers develop better skills as adults from their experience with youthful disadvantages such as height and strength.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

===Equipment===
One of the major appeals of bouldering is its relatively scant equipment requirements. Nothing is actually required - beyond suitable comfortable and flexible clothing - and it is not uncommon to see people bouldering with just climbing shoes, a chalk bag, and a crash mat.


Bouldering equipment may include:
* Close-fitting rubber '''[[climbing shoes]]''', for better traction and edging capabilities.
* Loose, powdered '''[[Chalk (Drying agent)|chalk]]''' may be used as a hand drying agent while climbing. Alternatively, '''[[liquid chalk]]''' is sometimes used.
* A mattress-like object called a '''[[bouldering mat|crash pad]]'''. These are generally thick, rectangular foam pads with a heavy-duty fabric shell. They are opened and placed at the base of a boulder to cover irregularities in the landing and provide some cushion if the climber falls.
* A '''brush''', or several brushes of differing sizes, is used to clean holds. Brushes are typically made with nylon bristles, but sometimes use coarse animal hair, and may be mounted on a telescopic pole to allow greater reach.
* '''[[Sports tape]]''' is useful for covering cuts or blisters, as well as providing support for joints that may have been strained.

===Ratings===
{{Main|Grade (bouldering)}}
As in other types of climbing, bouldering has developed its own [[grade (bouldering)|grading systems]] for comparing the difficulty of problems, mainly because bouldering problems can be much harder than traditional rock climbing routes. The most commonly used grading systems are the Fontainebleau system which ranges from 1 to 8c+, and the John Sherman V-grade system, beginning at V0 and increasing by integers to a current top grade of V16 ([[The Wheel of Life]] by [[Dai Koyamada]] in the [[Grampians National Park|Grampians]], Australia).  Both scales are open-ended at the top, and thus the upper grade of these systems is always increasing as boulderers ascend more difficult problems.

===History===
Bouldering's documented origins may be found in the [[United Kingdom]], [[France]], and [[Italy]] in the last quarter of the 19th century.&lt;ref name=Gill&gt;[http://www128.pair.com/r3d4k7/Bouldering_History1.0.html Origins of Bouldering - from John Gill's Website]&lt;/ref&gt; The British coined the words ''bouldering'' and ''problem'' at that time. The first documented bouldering advocate may have been [[Oscar Eckenstein]], a [[British people|British]] engineer and innovative climber who wrote about bouldering, and in the 1890s conducted an informal bouldering competition for natives in [[Askole]], a village in the [[Karakoram]] mountains.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www128.pair.com/r3d4k7/Bouldering_History1.01.html Oscar Eckenstein - from John Gill's Website]&lt;/ref&gt; For many years, bouldering was commonly viewed as a playful training activity for [[climbing|climbers]], although in the 1930s and late 1940s [[Pierre Allain]] and his companions enjoyed bouldering for its own sake in [[Fontainebleau]], considered by many to be the [[Mecca]] of bouldering. The first climber to actually make bouldering his primary specialty (in the mid 1950s) and to advocate its acceptance as a legitimate sport not restricted to a particular area was [[John Gill (climber)|John Gill]], a mathematician and amateur [[gymnast]] who found the challenge and movement of bouldering enjoyable.&lt;ref name=JG&gt;''The Art of Bouldering'' by John Gill, The Journal of the [[American Alpine Club]], 1969&lt;/ref&gt;

==Famous Bouldering Areas==

The region around [[Fontainebleau]] near [[Paris]] is particularly famous for its beautiful and concentrated bouldering areas. Other well-known areas are: [[Chironico]] (Switzerland), [[Stanage]] (UK), [[Hueco Tanks]] (Texas), [[Val Masino and Val di Mello]] (Italy), [[Castle Hill, New Zealand|Castle Hill]] (New Zealand), [[Bishop, California|Bishop]] (California), [[Joe's Valley]] (Utah), [[Yosemite]] (California), [[Rocktown]] (Georgia), [[Rocklands (South Africa)|Rocklands]] (South Africa), [[Cocalzinho de Goiás]] (Brazil), [[Kjugekull]] (Sweden), [[Hampi]] (India)&lt;ref name=Hampi &gt;[http://www.hampi.in/bouldering-in-hampi.htm Bouldering in Hampi&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Horse Pens 40]] (Alabama) and Horseshoe Canyon Ranch (Arkansas) amongst [[List of climbing areas|others]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{About|the boiling point of liquids}}
The '''boiling point''' of an element or a substance is the temperature at which the [[vapor pressure]] of the liquid equals the environmental pressure surrounding the liquid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David.E. Goldberg|title=3,000 Solved Problems in Chemistry|edition=1st|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=1988|id=ISBN 0-07-023684-4}} Section 17.43, page 321&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Louis Theodore, R. Ryan Dupont and Kumar Ganesan (Editors)|title=Pollution Prevention: The Waste Management Approach to the 21st Century|publisher=CRC Press|year=1999|id=ISBN 1-56670-495-2}} Section 27, page 15&lt;/ref&gt;

A liquid in a [[vacuum]] environment has a lower boiling point than when the liquid is at [[atmospheric pressure]]. A liquid in a high [[pressure]] environment has a higher boiling point than when the liquid is at atmospheric pressure. In other words, the boiling point of a liquid varies dependent upon the surrounding environmental pressure (which tends to vary with [[elevation]]). Different liquids (at a given pressure) boil at different temperatures.

The '''normal boiling point''' (also called the '''atmospheric boiling point''' or the '''atmospheric pressure boiling point''') of a liquid is the special case in which the vapor pressure of the liquid equals the defined atmospheric pressure at sea level, 1 [[Atmosphere (unit)|atmosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chem.purdue.edu/gchelp/gloss/normalbp.html General Chemistry Glossary] [[Purdue University]] website page&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kevin R. Reel, R. M. Fikar, P. E. Dumas, Jay M. Templin, and Patricia Van Arnum|title=AP Chemistry (REA) - The Best Test Prep for the Advanced Placement Exam|edition=9th|publisher=Research &amp; Education Association|year=2006|id=ISBN 0-7386-0221-3}} Section 71, page 224&lt;/ref&gt; At that temperature, the vapor pressure of the liquid becomes sufficient to overcome atmospheric pressure and lift the liquid to form bubbles inside the bulk of the liquid.  The '''standard boiling point''' is now (as of 1982) defined by [[IUPAC]] as the temperature at which boiling occurs under a pressure of 1 bar.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iupac.org/publications/pac/1982/pdf/5406x1239.pdf   Notation for States and Processes, Significance of the Word Standard in Chemical Thermodynamics, and Remarks on Commonly Tabulated Forms of Thermodynamic Functions] See page 1274&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[heat of vaporization]] is the amount of energy required to convert or vaporize a saturated liquid (i.e., a liquid at its boiling point) into a vapor.

Liquids may change to a vapor at temperatures below their boiling points through the process of [[evaporation]]. Evaporation is a surface phenomenon in which molecules located near the liquid's edge, not contained by enough liquid pressure on that side, escape into the surroundings as [[vapor]]. On the other hand, boiling is a process in which molecules anywhere in the liquid escape, resulting in the formation of vapor bubbles within the liquid.

==Saturation temperature and pressure==
A ''[[Saturation (chemistry)|saturated]] liquid'' contains as much thermal energy as it can without boiling (or conversely a ''saturated vapor'' contains as little thermal energy as it can without [[Condensation|condensing]]).

'''Saturation temperature''' means ''boiling point''. The saturation temperature is the temperature for a corresponding saturation pressure at which a liquid boils into its [[Gas|vapor phase]]. The liquid can be said to be saturated with [[thermal energy]]. Any addition of thermal energy results in a [[phase transition]].

If the pressure in a system remains constant ([[Isobaric process|isobaric]]), a vapor at saturation temperature will begin to condense into its liquid phase as thermal energy ([[heat]]) is removed. Similarly, a liquid at saturation temperature and pressure will boil into its vapor phase as additional thermal energy is applied.

The boiling point corresponds to the temperature at which the vapor pressure of the liquid equals the surrounding environmental pressure. Thus, the boiling point is dependent on the pressure. Usually, boiling points are published with respect to atmospheric  pressure (101.325 [[kilopascal]]s or 1 [[atmospheric pressure|atm]]). At higher elevations, where the atmospheric pressure is much lower, the boiling point is also lower. The boiling point increases with increased pressure up to the [[critical point (thermodynamics)|critical point]], where the gas and liquid properties become identical. The boiling point cannot be increased beyond the critical point. Likewise, the boiling point decreases with decreasing pressure until the [[triple point]] is reached. The boiling point cannot be reduced below the triple point.

If the heat of vaporization and the vapor pressure of a liquid at a certain temperature is known, the normal boiling point can be calculated by using the [[Clausius-Clapeyron equation]] thus:

&lt;math&gt;T_B = \Bigg(\frac{\,R\,\ln(P_0)}{\Delta H_{vap}}+\frac{1}{T_0}\Bigg)^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;

|}

'''Saturation pressure''' is the pressure for a corresponding saturation temperature at which a liquid boils into its vapor phase. Saturation pressure and saturation temperature have a direct relationship: as saturation pressure is increased so is saturation temperature.

If the temperature in a [[system]] remains constant (an ''[[isothermal]]'' system), vapor at saturation pressure and temperature will begin to [[condensation|condense]] into its liquid phase as the system pressure is increased. Similarly, a liquid at saturation pressure and temperature will tend to [[Flash evaporation|flash]] into its vapor phase as system pressure is decreased.

The boiling point of [[water]] is 100&amp;nbsp;[[Celsius|°C]] (212&amp;nbsp;[[Fahrenheit|°F]]) at standard pressure. On top of [[Mount Everest]], at 8,848 m elevation, the pressure is about 260 [[Millibar|mbar]] (26.39 kPa) and the boiling point of water is 69&amp;nbsp;[[Celsius|°C]]. (156.2&amp;nbsp;[[Fahrenheit|°F]]). The boiling point decreases 1 °C every 285 m of elevation.

For purists, the ''normal boiling point of water'' is 99.97 degrees Celsius at a pressure of 1 atm (i.e., 101.325 kPa). Until 1982 this was also the ''standard boiling point of water'', but the [[IUPAC]] now recommends a standard pressure of 1 bar (100 kPa). At this slightly reduced pressure, the ''standard boiling point of water'' is 99.61 degrees Celsius.

==Relation between the normal boiling point and the vapor pressure of liquids ==

[[Image:Vapor Pressure Chart.png|thumb|right|301 px|A typical vapor pressure chart for various liquids]]

The higher the vapor pressure of a liquid at a given temperature, the lower the normal boiling point (i.e., the boiling point at atmospheric pressure) of the liquid.

The vapor pressure chart to the right has graphs of the vapor pressures versus temperatures for a variety of liquids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Perry, R.H. and Green, D.W. (Editors)|title=[[Perry's Chemical Engineers' Handbook]]|edition=7th|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=1997|id= ISBN 0-07-049841-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; As can be seen in the chart, the liquids with the highest vapor pressures have the lowest normal boiling points.

For example, at any given temperature, [[propane]] has the highest vapor pressure of any of the liquids in the chart. It also has the lowest normal boiling point(-42.1 °C), which is where the vapor pressure curve of propane (the purple line) intersects the horizontal pressure line of one atmosphere ([[Atmosphere (unit)|atm]]) of absolute vapor pressure.

== Properties of the elements ==
{{see|List of elements by boiling point}}
The element with the lowest boiling point is [[helium]]. Both the boiling points of [[rhenium]] and [[tungsten]] exceed 5000 [[kelvin|K]] at [[standard pressure]]. Due to the experimental difficulty of precisely measuring extreme temperatures without bias, there is some discrepancy in the literature as to whether [[tungsten]] or [[rhenium]] has the higher boiling point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Howard DeVoe|title=Thermodynamics and Chemistry|edition=1st|publisher=Prentice-Hall|year=2000|id=ISBN 0-02-328741-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Georges Lemaître|Monsignor Georges Lemaître]], a [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|priest]] from the [[Catholic University of Louvain]], proposed what became known as the Big Bang theory of the origin of the universe, he called it his &quot;[[hypothesis]] of the primeval [[atom]]&quot;. The framework for the model relies on [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[general relativity]] and on simplifying assumptions (such as [[homogeneity (physics)#Translation invariance|homogeneity]] and [[isotropy]] of space). The governing equations had been formulated by [[Alexander Friedmann]]. In 1929, [[Edwin Hubble]] discovered that the distances to far away [[galaxy|galaxies]] were generally [[proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] to their [[redshift]]s — an idea originally suggested by Lemaître in 1927. Hubble's observation was taken to indicate that all very distant galaxies and clusters have an apparent velocity directly away from our vantage point: the farther away, the higher the apparent velocity.&lt;ref name=&quot;hubble&quot;&gt;

If the distance between galaxy clusters is increasing today, everything must have been closer together in the past. This idea has been considered in detail back in time to extreme [[density|densities]] and [[temperature]]s,&lt;ref&gt;

Without any evidence associated with the earliest instant of the expansion, the Big Bang theory ''cannot'' and ''does not'' provide any explanation for such an initial condition; rather, it ''describes'' and ''explains'' the general evolution of the universe since that instant. The observed abundances of the light elements throughout the cosmos closely match the calculated predictions for the formation of these elements from nuclear processes in the rapidly expanding and cooling first minutes of the universe, as logically and quantitatively detailed according to [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]].

[[Fred Hoyle]] is credited with coining the term ''Big Bang'' during a 1949 radio broadcast. It is popularly reported that Hoyle, who favored an alternative &quot;[[steady state universe|steady state]]&quot; cosmological model, intended this to be pejorative, but Hoyle explicitly denied this and said it was just a striking image meant to highlight the difference between the two models.&lt;ref&gt;

After the discovery of the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] in 1964, and especially when its spectrum (i.e., the amount of radiation measured at each wavelength) was found to match that of [[thermal radiation]] from a [[black body]], most scientists were fairly convinced by the evidence that some version of the Big Bang scenario must have occurred.

The Big Bang theory developed from observations of the structure of the Universe and from theoretical considerations. In 1912 [[Vesto Slipher]] measured the first [[Doppler shift]] of a &quot;[[spiral nebula]]&quot; (spiral nebula is the obsolete term for spiral galaxies), and soon discovered that almost all such nebulae were receding from Earth. He did not grasp the cosmological implications of this fact, and indeed at the time it was [[Shapley–Curtis debate|highly controversial]] whether or not these nebulae were &quot;island universes&quot; outside our [[Milky Way]].&lt;ref&gt;

In 1931 [[Georges Lemaître|Lemaître]] went further and suggested that the evident expansion in forward time required that the Universe contracted backwards in time, and would continue to do so until it could contract no further, bringing all the mass of the Universe into a single point, a &quot;primeval [[atom]]&quot; where and when the fabric of time and space comes into existence.&lt;ref&gt;

Starting in 1924, Hubble painstakingly developed a series of distance indicators, the forerunner of the [[cosmic distance ladder]], using the {{convert|100|in|mm|sing=on}} Hooker telescope at [[Mount Wilson Observatory]]. This allowed him to estimate distances to galaxies whose [[redshift]]s had already been measured, mostly by Slipher.

The earliest phases of the Big Bang are subject to much speculation. In the most common models, the Universe was filled [[Homogeneous space|homogeneously]] and [[isotropic]]ally with an incredibly high [[energy density]], huge [[temperature]]s and [[pressure]]s, and was very rapidly expanding and cooling. Approximately 10&lt;sup&gt;−37&lt;/sup&gt; seconds into the expansion, a [[phase transition]] caused a [[cosmic inflation]], during which the Universe grew [[exponential growth|exponentially]].&lt;ref name=&quot;guth&quot;&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Temperatures were so high that the random motions of particles were at [[Special relativity|relativistic]] [[Relativistic speed|speeds]], and [[pair production|particle–antiparticle pairs]] of all kinds were being continuously created and destroyed in collisions. At some point an unknown reaction called [[baryogenesis]] violated the conservation of [[baryon number]], leading to a very small excess of [[quark]]s and [[lepton]]s over antiquarks and antileptons—of the order of one part in 30&amp;nbsp;million. This resulted in the predominance of [[matter]] over [[antimatter]] in the present Universe.&lt;ref name=&quot;kolb_c6&quot;&gt;Kolb and Turner (1988), chapter 6&lt;/ref&gt;

The Universe continued to grow in size and fall in temperature, hence the typical energy of each particle was decreasing. [[Explicit symmetry breaking|Symmetry breaking]] phase transitions put the [[fundamental force]]s of physics and the parameters of [[elementary particles]] into their present form.&lt;ref name=&quot;kolb_c7&quot;&gt;Kolb and Turner (1988), chapter 7&lt;/ref&gt; After about 10&lt;sup&gt;−11&lt;/sup&gt; seconds, the picture becomes less speculative, since particle energies drop to values that can be attained in [[particle physics]] experiments. At about 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; seconds, quarks and gluons combined to form [[baryon]]s such as protons and neutrons. The small excess of quarks over antiquarks led to a small excess of baryons over antibaryons. The temperature was now no longer high enough to create new proton–antiproton pairs (similarly for neutrons–antineutrons), so a mass annihilation immediately followed, leaving just one in 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; of the original protons and neutrons, and none of their antiparticles. A similar process happened at about 1 second for electrons and positrons. After these annihilations, the remaining protons, neutrons and electrons were no longer moving relativistically and the energy density of the Universe was dominated by [[photon]]s (with a minor contribution from [[neutrino]]s).

A few minutes into the expansion, when the temperature was about a billion (one thousand million; 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;; SI prefix [[giga-]]) [[kelvin]] and the density was about that of air, neutrons combined with protons to form the Universe's [[deuterium]] and [[helium]] [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]] in a process called [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;kolb_c4&quot;/&gt; Most protons remained uncombined as [[hydrogen]] nuclei. As the Universe cooled, the [[rest mass]] energy density of matter came to [[gravity|gravitationally]] dominate that of the photon [[electromagnetic radiation|radiation]]. After about 379,000 years the electrons and nuclei combined into atoms (mostly [[hydrogen]]); hence the radiation decoupled from matter and continued through space largely unimpeded. This relic radiation is known as the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;peacock_c9&quot;&gt;Peacock (1999), chapter 9&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hubble ultra deep field high rez edit1.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Hubble Ultra Deep Field]] showcases galaxies from an ancient era when the Universe was younger, denser, and warmer according to the Big Bang theory.]]

Over a long period of time, the slightly denser regions of the nearly uniformly distributed matter gravitationally attracted nearby matter and thus grew even denser, forming gas clouds, [[star]]s, galaxies, and the other astronomical structures observable today. The details of this process depend on the amount and type of matter in the Universe. The four possible types of matter are known as [[cold dark matter]], [[warm dark matter]], [[hot dark matter]] and [[baryonic matter]]. The best measurements available (from [[WMAP]]) show that the data is well-fit by a [[Lambda-CDM model]] in which dark matter is assumed to be cold ([[warm dark matter]] is ruled out by early [[reionization]]&lt;ref&gt;

Independent lines of evidence from [[Type Ia supernova]]e and the [[Cosmic microwave background radiation|CMB]] imply that the Universe today is dominated by a mysterious form of energy known as [[dark energy]], which apparently permeates all of space. The observations suggest 73% of the total energy density of today's Universe is in this form. When the Universe was very young, it was likely infused with dark energy, but with less space and everything closer together, gravity had the upper hand, and it was slowly braking the expansion. But eventually, after numerous billion years of expansion, the growing abundance of dark energy caused the [[Hubble's law|expansion of the Universe]] to slowly begin to accelerate. Dark energy in its simplest formulation takes the form of the [[cosmological constant]] term in [[Einstein's field equation]]s of general relativity, but its composition and mechanism are unknown and, more generally, the details of its [[equation of state (cosmology)|equation of state]] and relationship with the [[Standard Model]] of particle physics continue to be investigated both observationally and theoretically.&lt;ref name=&quot;peebles&quot; /&gt;

All of this cosmic evolution after the [[inflationary epoch]] can be rigorously described and modeled by the [[Lambda-CDM model|ΛCDM model]] of cosmology, which uses the independent frameworks of quantum mechanics and Einstein's General Relativity. As noted above, there is no well-supported model describing the action prior to 10&lt;sup&gt;−15&lt;/sup&gt; seconds or so. Apparently a new unified theory of [[quantum gravity|quantum gravitation]] is needed to break this barrier. Understanding this earliest of eras in the history of the Universe is currently one of the greatest [[unsolved problems in physics]].

===Underlying assumptions===
The Big Bang theory depends on two major assumptions: the universality of [[physical law]]s, and the [[cosmological principle]]. The cosmological principle states that on large scales the Universe is [[Homogeneous space|homogeneous]] and [[isotropy|isotropic]].

These ideas were initially taken as postulates, but today there are efforts to test each of them. For example, the first assumption has been tested by observations showing that largest possible deviation of the [[fine structure constant]] over much of the [[age of the universe]] is of order 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;

If the large-scale Universe appears isotropic as viewed from Earth, the cosmological principle can be derived from the simpler [[Copernican principle]], which states that there is no preferred (or special) observer or vantage point. To this end, the cosmological principle has been confirmed to a level of 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; via observations of the CMB.&lt;ref group=&quot;notes&quot;&gt;This ignores the [[dipole anisotropy]] at a level of 0.1% due to the peculiar velocity of the solar system through the radiation field.&lt;/ref&gt; The Universe has been measured to be homogeneous on the largest scales at the 10% level.&lt;ref&gt;

===FLRW metric===
{{Main|Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric|Metric expansion of space}}
General relativity describes spacetime by a [[metric tensor|metric]], which determines the distances that separate nearby points. The points, which can be galaxies, stars, or other objects, themselves are specified using a [[coordinate chart]] or &quot;grid&quot; that is laid down over all [[spacetime]]. The cosmological principle implies that the metric should be [[Homogeneous space|homogeneous]] and [[isotropic]] on large scales, which uniquely singles out the [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric]] (FLRW metric). This metric contains a [[scale factor]], which describes how the size of the Universe changes with time. This enables a convenient choice of a [[coordinate system]] to be made, called [[comoving coordinates]]. In this coordinate system, the grid expands along with the Universe, and objects that are moving only due to the expansion of the Universe remain at fixed points on the grid. While their ''coordinate'' distance ([[comoving distance]]) remains constant, the ''physical'' distance between two such comoving points expands proportionally with the [[scale factor]] of the Universe.&lt;ref&gt;

The Big Bang is not an explosion of matter moving outward to fill an empty universe. Instead, [[metric expansion of space|space itself expands]] with time everywhere and increases the physical distance between two comoving points. Because the FLRW metric assumes a uniform distribution of mass and energy, it applies to our Universe only on large scales—local concentrations of matter such as our galaxy are gravitationally bound and as such do not experience the large-scale expansion of space.

===Horizons===
{{Main|Cosmological horizon}}
An important feature of the Big Bang spacetime is the presence of [[Observable universe#Cosmological horizon|horizon]]s. Since the Universe has a finite age, and light travels at a finite speed, there may be events in the past whose light has not had time to reach us. This places a limit or a ''past horizon'' on the most distant objects that can be observed. Conversely, because space is expanding, and more distant objects are receding ever more quickly, light emitted by us today may never &quot;catch up&quot; to very distant objects. This defines a ''future horizon'', which limits the events in the future that we will be able to influence. The presence of either type of horizon depends on the details of the FLRW model that describes our Universe. Our understanding of the Universe back to very early times [[Big Bang#Horizon problem|suggests]] that there is a past horizon, though in practice our view is also limited by the opacity of the Universe at early times. So our view cannot extend further backward in time, though the horizon recedes in space. If the expansion of the Universe continues to [[accelerating universe|accelerate]], there is a future horizon as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;kolb_c3&quot;&gt;Kolb and Turner (1988), chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Observational evidence==
The earliest and most direct kinds of observational evidence are the [[Hubble's law|Hubble-type expansion]] seen in the [[redshift]]s of galaxies, the detailed measurements of the [[cosmic microwave background]], the abundance of light elements (see [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]]), and today also the [[Large-scale structure of the cosmos|large scale distribution]] and apparent [[Galaxy formation and evolution|evolution of galaxies]]&lt;ref&gt;

===Hubble's law and the expansion of space===
{{Main|Hubble's law|Metric expansion of space}}
{{See also|Distance measures (cosmology)|Scale factor (universe)}}
Observations of distant galaxies and [[quasar]]s show that these objects are [[redshift]]ed—the [[light]] emitted from them has been shifted to longer wavelengths. This can be seen by taking a [[frequency spectrum]] of an object and matching the [[spectroscopy|spectroscopic]] pattern of [[emission line]]s or [[absorption line]]s corresponding to [[atom]]s of the [[chemical element]]s interacting with the light. These redshifts are [[Homogeneity (physics)|uniformly]] [[Isotropy|isotropic]], distributed evenly among the observed objects in all directions. If the [[redshift]] is interpreted as a [[Doppler shift]], the recessional [[velocity]] of the object can be calculated. For some galaxies, it is possible to estimate distances via the [[cosmic distance ladder]]. When the recessional velocities are plotted against these distances, a linear relationship known as [[Hubble's law]] is observed:&lt;ref name=&quot;hubble&quot; /&gt;
:''v'' = ''H''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''D'',
where
*''v'' is the recessional [[velocity]] of the [[galaxy]] or other distant object,
*''D'' is the [[comoving distance]] to the object, and
*''H''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is [[Hubble's constant]], measured to be {{nowrap|70.4 {{±|1.3|1.4}}}} [[kilometers|km]]/[[second|s]]/[[Megaparsec|Mpc]] by the [[WMAP]] probe.&lt;ref name=&quot;wmap7year&quot; /&gt;

[[Hubble's law]] has two possible explanations. Either we are at the center of an explosion of galaxies—which is untenable given the [[Copernican Principle]]—or the Universe is [[Metric expansion of space|uniformly expanding]] everywhere. This universal expansion was predicted from [[general relativity]] by [[Alexander Friedmann]] in 1922&lt;ref name=af1922 /&gt; and [[Georges Lemaître]] in 1927,&lt;ref name=gl1927 /&gt; well before Hubble made his 1929 analysis and observations, and it remains the cornerstone of the Big Bang theory as developed by [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric|Friedmann, Lemaître, Robertson and Walker]].

The theory requires the relation ''v'' = ''HD'' to hold at all times, where ''D'' is the [[comoving distance]], ''v'' is the [[recessional velocity]], and ''v'', ''H'', and ''D'' vary as the Universe expands (hence we write ''H''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; to denote the present-day Hubble &quot;constant&quot;). For distances much smaller than the size of the [[observable Universe]], the Hubble redshift can be thought of as the Doppler shift corresponding to the recession velocity ''v''. However, the redshift is not a true Doppler shift, but rather the result of the expansion of the Universe between the time the light was emitted and the time that it was detected.&lt;ref name=&quot;peacock_c3&quot;&gt;Peacock (1999), chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt;

That [[Metric expansion of space|space is undergoing metric expansion]] is shown by direct observational evidence of the [[Cosmological Principle]] and the Copernican Principle, which together with Hubble's law have no other explanation. Astronomical [[redshift]]s are extremely [[isotropic]] and [[Homogeneity (physics)#Translation invariance|homogenous]],&lt;ref name=&quot;hubble&quot; /&gt; supporting the Cosmological Principle that the Universe looks the same in all directions, along with much other evidence. If the redshifts were the result of an explosion from a center distant from us, they would not be so similar in different directions.

Measurements of the effects of the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] on the dynamics of distant astrophysical systems in 2000 proved the [[Copernican Principle]], that the Earth is not in a central position, on a cosmological scale.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Radiation from the Big Bang was demonstrably warmer at earlier times throughout the Universe. Uniform cooling of the cosmic microwave background over billions of years is explainable only if the Universe is experiencing a metric expansion, and excludes the possibility that we are near the unique center of an explosion.

===Cosmic microwave background radiation===
{{Main|Cosmic microwave background radiation}}
[[File:WMAP 2010.png|thumb|[[WMAP]] image of the cosmic microwave background radiation]]

During the first few days of the Universe, the Universe was in full [[Thermodynamic equilibrium|thermal equilibrium]], with photons being continually emitted and absorbed, giving the radiation a [[blackbody]] spectrum. As the Universe expanded, it cooled to a temperature at which photons could no longer be created or destroyed. The temperature was still high enough for electrons and nuclei to remain unbound, however, and photons were constantly &quot;reflected&quot; from these free electrons through a process called [[Thomson scattering]]. Because of this repeated scattering, the early Universe was opaque to light.

When the temperature fell to a few thousand [[Kelvin]], electrons and nuclei began to combine to form atoms, a process known as [[recombination (cosmology)|recombination]]. Since photons scatter infrequently from neutral atoms, radiation decoupled from matter when nearly all the electrons had recombined, at the ''epoch of last scattering'', 379,000 years after the Big Bang. These photons make up the CMB that is observed today, and the observed pattern of fluctuations in the CMB is a direct picture of the Universe at this early epoch. The energy of photons was subsequently redshifted by the expansion of the Universe, which preserved the blackbody spectrum but caused its temperature to fall, meaning that the photons now fall into the [[microwave]] region of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]]. The radiation is thought to be observable at every point in the Universe, and comes from all directions with (almost) the same intensity.

In 1964, [[Arno Penzias]] and [[Robert Woodrow Wilson|Robert Wilson]] accidentally discovered the cosmic background radiation while conducting diagnostic observations using a new [[microwave]] receiver owned by [[Bell Laboratories]].&lt;ref name=&quot;penzias&quot; /&gt; Their discovery provided substantial confirmation of the general CMB predictions—the radiation was found to be isotropic and consistent with a blackbody spectrum of about 3&amp;nbsp;K—and it pitched the balance of opinion in favor of the Big Bang hypothesis. Penzias and Wilson were awarded a [[Nobel Prize]] for their discovery.

In 1989, [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration|NASA]] launched the [[Cosmic Background Explorer satellite]] (COBE), and the initial findings, released in 1990, were consistent with the Big Bang's predictions regarding the CMB. COBE found a residual temperature of 2.726&amp;nbsp;K and in 1992 detected for the first time the fluctuations (anisotropies) in the CMB, at a level of about one part in 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=&quot;cobe&quot; /&gt; [[John C. Mather]] and [[George Smoot]] were awarded Nobels for their leadership in this work. During the following decade, CMB anisotropies were further investigated by a large number of ground-based and balloon experiments. In 2000–2001, several experiments, most notably [[BOOMERanG experiment|BOOMERanG]], found the Universe to be almost spatially flat by measuring the typical angular size (the size on the sky) of the anisotropies. (See [[shape of the Universe]].)

In early 2003, the first results of the [[WMAP|Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe]] (WMAP) were released, yielding what were at the time the most accurate values for some of the cosmological parameters. This spacecraft also disproved several specific [[cosmic inflation]] models, but the results were consistent with the inflation theory in general,&lt;ref name=&quot;wmap1year&quot; /&gt; it confirms too that a sea of [[Cosmic neutrino background|cosmic neutrinos]] permeates the Universe, a clear evidence that the first stars took more than a half-billion years to create a cosmic fog. A new space probe named [[Planck (spacecraft)|Planck]], with goals similar to WMAP, was launched in May 2009. It is anticipated to soon provide even more accurate measurements of the CMB anisotropies. Many other ground- and balloon-based experiments are also currently running; see [[Cosmic microwave background experiments]].

The background radiation is exceptionally smooth, which presented a problem in that conventional expansion would mean that photons coming from opposite directions in the sky were coming from regions that had never been in contact with each other. The leading explanation for this far reaching equilibrium is that the Universe had a brief period of rapid exponential expansion, called [[cosmic inflation|inflation]]. This would have the effect of driving apart regions that had been in [[Thermodynamic equilibrium|equilibrium]], so that all the observable Universe was from the same equilibrated region.

===Abundance of primordial elements===
{{Main|Big Bang nucleosynthesis}}
Using the Big Bang model it is possible to calculate the concentration of [[helium-4]], [[helium-3]], [[deuterium]] and [[lithium-7]] in the Universe as ratios to the amount of ordinary hydrogen, H.&lt;ref name = &quot;kolb_c4&quot;/&gt; All the abundances depend on a single parameter, the ratio of [[photon]]s to [[baryon]]s, which itself can be calculated independently from the detailed structure of CMB fluctuations. The ratios predicted (by mass, not by number) are about 0.25 for {{SimpleNuclide2|Helium|4}}/{{Element2|Hydrogen}}, about 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; for {{SimpleNuclide2|Hydrogen|2}}/{{Element2|Hydrogen}}, about 10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt; for {{SimpleNuclide2|Helium|3}}/{{Element2|Hydrogen}} and about 10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt; for {{SimpleNuclide2|Lithium|7}}/{{Element2|Hydrogen}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;kolb_c4&quot;&gt;Kolb and Turner (1988), chapter 4&lt;/ref&gt;

The measured abundances all agree at least roughly with those predicted from a single value of the baryon-to-photon ratio. The agreement is excellent for deuterium, close but formally discrepant for {{SimpleNuclide2|Helium|4}}, and a factor of two off for {{SimpleNuclide2|Lithium|7}}; in the latter two cases there are substantial [[systematic error|systematic uncertainties]]. Nonetheless, the general consistency with abundances predicted by BBN is strong evidence for the Big Bang, as the theory is the only known explanation for the relative abundances of light elements, and it is virtually impossible to &quot;tune&quot; the Big Bang to produce much more or less than 20–30% helium.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed there is no obvious reason outside of the Big Bang that, for example, the young Universe (i.e., before star formation, as determined by studying matter supposedly free of [[stellar nucleosynthesis]] products) should have more helium than deuterium or more deuterium than {{SimpleNuclide2|Helium|3}}, and in constant ratios, too.

===Galactic evolution and distribution===
{{Main|Large-scale structure of the cosmos|Structure formation|Galaxy formation and evolution}}

[[File:2MASS LSS chart-NEW Nasa.jpg|right|thumb|This panoramic view of the entire [[near-infrared]] sky reveals the distribution of galaxies beyond the [[Milky Way]]. The galaxies are color coded by [[redshift]].]]

Detailed observations of the [[Galaxy morphological classification|morphology]] and [[Large-scale structure of the cosmos|distribution]] of galaxies and [[quasars]] provide strong evidence for the Big Bang. A combination of observations and theory suggest that the first quasars and galaxies formed about a billion years after the Big Bang, and since then larger structures have been forming, such as [[galaxy groups and clusters|galaxy clusters]] and [[supercluster]]s. Populations of stars have been aging and evolving, so that distant galaxies (which are observed as they were in the early Universe) appear very different from nearby galaxies (observed in a more recent state). Moreover, galaxies that formed relatively recently appear markedly different from galaxies formed at similar distances but shortly after the Big Bang. These observations are strong arguments against the steady-state model. Observations of [[star formation]], galaxy and quasar distributions and larger structures agree well with Big Bang simulations of the formation of structure in the Universe and are helping to complete details of the theory.&lt;ref&gt;

===Other lines of evidence===
After some controversy, the age of Universe as estimated from the Hubble expansion and the CMB is now in good agreement with (i.e., slightly larger than) the ages of the oldest stars, both as measured by applying the theory of [[stellar evolution]] to [[globular clusters]] and through [[radiometric dating]] of individual [[Population II]] stars.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

The prediction that the CMB temperature was higher in the past has been experimentally supported by observations of temperature-sensitive emission lines in gas clouds at high redshift. This prediction also implies that the amplitude of the [[Sunyaev–Zel'dovich effect]] in [[clusters of galaxies]] does not depend directly on redshift; this seems to be roughly true, but unfortunately the amplitude does depend on cluster properties which do change substantially over cosmic time, so a precise test is impossible.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

==Features, issues and problems==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Cosmic inflation]] --&gt;
While scientists now prefer the Big Bang model over other cosmological models, the scientific community was once divided between supporters of the Big Bang and those of [[non-standard cosmologies|alternative cosmological models]]. Throughout the historical development of the subject, problems with the Big Bang theory were posed in the context of a scientific controversy regarding which model could best describe the [[observational cosmology|cosmological observations]]. With the overwhelming [[scientific consensus|consensus]] in the community today supporting the Big Bang model, many of these problems are remembered as being mainly of historical interest; the solutions to them have been obtained either through modifications to the theory or as the result of better observations.

The core ideas of the Big Bang—the expansion, the early hot state, the formation of helium, the formation of galaxies—are derived from many observations that are independent from any cosmological model; these include the [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis|abundance of light elements]], the [[cosmic microwave background]], [[Large-scale structure of the cosmos|large scale structure]], and the [[Hubble diagram]] for [[Type Ia supernova]]e.

Precise modern models of the Big Bang appeal to various exotic physical phenomena that have not been observed in terrestrial laboratory experiments or incorporated into the [[Standard Model]] of [[particle physics]]. Of these features, [[dark matter]] is currently the subject to the most active laboratory investigations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www8.nationalacademies.org/astro2010/DetailFileDisplay.aspx?id=225 Direct Searches for Dark Matter], [[White paper]], [http://nationalacademies.org/ The National Academies].&lt;/ref&gt; Remaining issues, such as the [[cuspy halo problem]] and the [[dwarf galaxy problem]] of [[cold dark matter]], are not fatal to the dark matter explanation as solutions to such problems exist which involve only further refinements of the theory. [[Dark energy]] is also an area of intense interest for scientists, but it is not clear whether direct detection of dark energy will be possible.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www8.nationalacademies.org/astro2010/DetailFileDisplay.aspx?id=243 Whitepaper: For a Comprehensive Space-Based Dark Energy Mission], [http://nationalacademies.org/ The National Academies].&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, [[cosmic inflation|inflation]] and [[baryogenesis]] remain somewhat more speculative features of current Big Bang models: they explain important features of the early universe, but could be replaced by alternative ideas without affecting the rest of the theory.&lt;ref group=&quot;notes&quot;&gt;If inflation is true, baryogenesis must have occurred, but not vice versa.&lt;/ref&gt; Discovering the correct explanations for such phenomena are some of the remaining [[unsolved problems in physics]].

===Horizon problem===
{{Main|Horizon problem}}
The horizon problem results from the premise that information cannot travel [[faster than light]]. In a Universe of finite age, this sets a limit—the [[particle horizon]]—on the separation of any two regions of space that are in [[causality (physics)|causal]] contact.&lt;ref name=&quot;kolb_c8&quot;&gt;Kolb and Turner (1988), chapter 8&lt;/ref&gt; The observed isotropy of the CMB is problematic in this regard: if the Universe had been dominated by radiation or matter at all times up to the epoch of last scattering, the particle horizon at that time would correspond to about 2 degrees on the sky. There would then be no mechanism to cause wider regions to have the same temperature.

A resolution to this apparent inconsistency is offered by [[inflationary theory]] in which a homogeneous and isotropic scalar energy field dominates the Universe at some very early period (before baryogenesis). During inflation, the Universe undergoes exponential expansion, and the particle horizon expands much more rapidly than previously assumed, so that regions presently on opposite sides of the observable Universe are well inside each other's particle horizon. The observed isotropy of the CMB then follows from the fact that this larger region was in causal contact before the beginning of inflation.

[[Heisenberg's uncertainty principle]] predicts that during the inflationary phase there would be [[primordial fluctuations|quantum thermal fluctuations]], which would be magnified to cosmic scale. These fluctuations serve as the seeds of all current structure in the Universe. Inflation predicts that the [[primordial fluctuations]] are nearly [[Scale invariance|scale invariant]] and [[Normal distribution|Gaussian]], which has been accurately confirmed by measurements of the CMB.

If inflation occurred, exponential expansion would push large regions of space well beyond our observable horizon.

===Flatness/oldness problem===
{{Main|Flatness problem}}
[[File:End of universe.jpg|thumb|275px|The overall [[Shape of the Universe|geometry of the Universe]] is determined by whether the [[Friedmann equations#Density parameter|Omega cosmological parameter]] is less than, equal to or greater than 1. Shown from top to bottom are a [[Shape of the Universe#Spherical universe|closed Universe]] with positive curvature, a [[Shape of the Universe#Hyperbolic universe|hyperbolic Universe]] with negative curvature and a [[Shape of the Universe#Flat universe|flat Universe]] with zero curvature.]]

The flatness problem (also known as the oldness problem) is an observational problem associated with a [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric]].&lt;ref name=&quot;kolb_c8&quot;/&gt; The Universe may have positive, negative or zero spatial [[curvature]] depending on its total energy density. Curvature is negative if its density is less than the [[critical density]], positive if greater, and zero at the critical density, in which case space is said to be ''flat''. The problem is that any small departure from the critical density grows with time, and yet the Universe today remains very close to flat.&lt;ref group=&quot;notes&quot;&gt;Strictly, dark energy in the form of a cosmological constant drives the Universe towards a flat state; however, our Universe remained close to flat for several billion years, before the dark energy density became significant.&lt;/ref&gt; Given that a natural timescale for departure from flatness might be the [[Planck time]], 10&lt;sup&gt;−43&lt;/sup&gt; seconds, the fact that the Universe has reached neither a [[Heat Death]] nor a [[Big Crunch]] after billions of years requires some explanation. For instance, even at the relatively late age of a few minutes
(the time of nucleosynthesis), the Universe density must have been within one part in 10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; of its critical value, or it would not exist as it does today.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A resolution to this problem is offered by [[inflationary theory]]. During the inflationary period, spacetime expanded to such an extent that its [[curvature]] would have been smoothed out. Thus, it is theorized that inflation drove the Universe to a very nearly spatially flat state, with almost exactly the critical density.

===Magnetic monopoles===
{{Main|Magnetic monopole}}
The magnetic monopole objection was raised in the late 1970s. [[Grand unification theory|Grand unification theories]] predicted [[topological defect]]s in space that would manifest as [[magnetic monopole]]s. These objects would be produced efficiently in the hot early Universe, resulting in a density much higher than is consistent with observations, given that searches have never found any monopoles. This problem is also resolved by [[cosmic inflation]], which removes all point defects from the observable Universe in the same way that it drives the geometry to flatness.&lt;ref name=&quot;kolb_c8&quot;&gt;Kolb and Turner, chapter 8&lt;/ref&gt;

A resolution to the horizon, flatness, and magnetic monopole problems alternative to cosmic inflation is offered by the [[Weyl curvature hypothesis]].&lt;ref&gt;

===Baryon asymmetry===
{{Main|Baryon asymmetry}}
It is not yet understood why the Universe has more [[matter]] than [[antimatter]].&lt;ref name=&quot;kolb_c6&quot;&gt;Kolb and Turner, chapter 6&lt;/ref&gt; It is generally assumed that when the Universe was young and very hot, it was in statistical equilibrium and contained equal numbers of [[baryon]]s and antibaryons. However, observations suggest that the Universe, including its most distant parts, is made almost entirely of matter. An unknown process called &quot;[[baryogenesis]]&quot; created the asymmetry. For baryogenesis to occur, the [[Sakharov conditions]] must be satisfied. These require that [[baryon number]] is not conserved, that [[C-symmetry]] and [[CP-symmetry]] are violated and that the Universe depart from [[thermodynamic equilibrium]].&lt;ref name=&quot;sakharov&quot;&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; All these conditions occur in the [[Standard Model]], but the effect is not strong enough to explain the present baryon asymmetry.

===Globular cluster age===
In the mid-1990s, observations of [[globular cluster]]s appeared to be inconsistent with the Big Bang. Computer simulations that matched the observations of the [[star|stellar]] populations of globular clusters suggested that they were about 15&amp;nbsp;billion years old, which conflicted with the 13.7&amp;nbsp;billion year age of the Universe. This issue was generally resolved in the late 1990s when new computer simulations, which included the effects of mass loss due to [[stellar wind]]s, indicated a much younger age for globular clusters.&lt;ref&gt;

===Dark matter===

During the 1970s and 1980s, various observations showed that there is not sufficient visible matter in the Universe to account for the apparent strength of gravitational forces within and between galaxies. This led to the idea that up to 90% of the matter in the Universe is dark matter that does not emit light or interact with normal [[baryon]]ic matter. In addition, the assumption that the Universe is mostly normal matter led to predictions that were strongly inconsistent with observations. In particular, the Universe today is far more lumpy and contains far less [[deuterium]] than can be accounted for without dark matter. While dark matter was initially controversial, it is now indicated by numerous observations: the anisotropies in the CMB, [[galaxy groups and clusters|galaxy cluster]] velocity dispersions, large-scale structure distributions, [[gravitational lensing]] studies, and [[X-ray astronomy|X-ray measurements]] of galaxy clusters.&lt;ref&gt;

The evidence for dark matter comes from its gravitational influence on other matter, and no dark matter particles have been observed in laboratories. Many [[particle physics]] candidates for dark matter have been proposed, and several projects to detect them directly are underway.&lt;ref name=&quot;pdg&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

===Dark energy===
{{Main|Dark energy}}
Measurements of the [[redshift]]–[[apparent magnitude|magnitude]] relation for [[type Ia supernova]]e indicate that the expansion of the Universe has been [[accelerating universe|accelerating]] since the Universe was about half its present age. To explain this acceleration, [[general relativity]] requires that much of the energy in the Universe consists of a component with large [[equation of state (cosmology)|negative pressure]], dubbed &quot;[[dark energy]]&quot;. Dark energy is indicated by several other lines of evidence. Measurements of the [[cosmic microwave background]] indicate that the Universe is very nearly spatially flat, and therefore according to general relativity the Universe must have almost exactly the [[critical density]] of mass/energy. But the [[density|mass density]] of the Universe can be measured from its gravitational clustering, and is found to have only about 30% of the critical density.&lt;ref name=&quot;peebles&quot; /&gt; Since dark energy does not cluster in the usual way it is the best explanation for the &quot;missing&quot; energy density. Dark energy is also required by two geometrical measures of the overall curvature of the Universe, one using the frequency of [[gravitational lens]]es, and the other using the characteristic pattern of the [[large-scale structure]] as a cosmic ruler.

Negative pressure is a property of [[vacuum energy]], but the exact nature of dark energy remains one of the great mysteries of the Big Bang. Possible candidates include a [[cosmological constant]] and [[quintessence (physics)|quintessence]]. Results from the WMAP team in 2008, which combined data from the CMB and other sources, indicate that the Universe today is 73% dark energy, 23% dark matter, 4.6% regular matter and less than 1% neutrinos.&lt;ref name=&quot;wmap7year&quot; /&gt; The energy density in matter decreases with the expansion of the Universe, but the dark energy density remains constant (or nearly so) as the Universe expands. Therefore matter made up a larger fraction of the total energy of the Universe in the past than it does today, but its fractional contribution will fall in the far future as dark energy becomes even more dominant.

In the [[Lambda-CDM model|ΛCDM]], the best current model of the Big Bang, dark energy is explained by the presence of a [[cosmological constant]] in the [[general relativity|general theory of relativity]]. However, the size of the constant that properly explains dark energy is surprisingly small relative to naive estimates based on ideas about [[quantum gravity]]. Distinguishing between the cosmological constant and other explanations of dark energy is an active area of current research.

==The future according to the Big Bang theory==
{{Main|Ultimate fate of the universe}}
Before observations of [[dark energy]], cosmologists considered two scenarios for the future of the Universe. If the mass [[density]] of the Universe were greater than the [[critical density]], then the Universe would reach a maximum size and then begin to collapse. It would become denser and hotter again, ending with a state that was similar to that in which it started—a [[Big Crunch]].&lt;ref name=&quot;kolb_c3&quot;&gt;Kolb and Turner, 1988, chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, if the density in the Universe were equal to or below the critical density, the expansion would slow down, but never stop. Star formation would cease as all the interstellar gas in each galaxy is consumed; stars would burn out leaving [[white dwarf]]s, [[neutron star]]s, and [[black hole]]s. Very gradually, collisions between these would result in mass accumulating into larger and larger black holes. The average temperature of the Universe would asymptotically approach [[absolute zero]]—a [[Big Freeze]]. Moreover, if the proton were [[proton decay|unstable]], then baryonic matter would disappear, leaving only radiation and black holes. Eventually, black holes would evaporate by emitting [[Hawking radiation]]. The [[entropy]] of the Universe would increase to the point where no organized form of energy could be extracted from it, a scenario known as [[heat death]].

Modern observations of [[accelerating universe|accelerated expansion]] imply that more and more of the currently visible Universe will pass beyond our [[event horizon]] and out of contact with us. The eventual result is not known. The [[Lambda-CDM model|ΛCDM model]] of the Universe contains [[dark energy]] in the form of a [[cosmological constant]]. This theory suggests that only gravitationally bound systems, such as galaxies, would remain together, and they too would be subject to [[heat death]], as the Universe expands and cools. Other explanations of dark energy—so-called [[phantom energy]] theories—suggest that ultimately [[galaxy groups and clusters|galaxy clusters]], stars, planets, atoms, nuclei and matter itself will be torn apart by the ever-increasing expansion in a so-called [[Big Rip]].&lt;ref&gt;

==Speculative physics beyond Big Bang theory==
[[File:CMB Timeline300 no WMAP.jpg|right|350px|thumb|This is an artist's concept of the Universe expansion, where space (including hypothetical non-observable portions of the Universe) is represented at each time by the circular sections. Note on the left the dramatic expansion (not to scale) occurring in the inflationary epoch, and at the center the expansion acceleration. The scheme is decorated with [[Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe|WMAP]] images on the left and with the representation of stars at the appropriate level of development.]]

While the Big Bang model is well established in cosmology, it is likely to be refined in the future. Little is known about the earliest moments of the Universe's history. The [[Penrose–Hawking singularity theorems]] require the existence of a [[gravitational singularity|singularity]] at the beginning of cosmic time. However, these theorems assume that [[general relativity]] is correct, but general relativity must break down before the Universe reaches the [[Planck temperature]], and a correct treatment of [[quantum gravity]] may avoid the singularity.&lt;ref&gt;

==Religious interpretations==
{{Main|Religious interpretations of the Big Bang theory}}
The Big Bang is a [[scientific theory]], and as such is dependent on its agreement with observations. But as a theory which addresses the origins of reality, it has always carried theological and philosophical implications, most notably, the concept of creation ''[[ex nihilo]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Russell - Theological Implications&quot;&gt;

'''Bock''' is the term for a [[strong lager]] of German origin. Several substyles are based on bock, including '''[[maibock]]''' or '''helles bock''', a paler, more hopped version generally made for consumption at spring festivals; '''[[doppelbock]]''', a stronger and maltier version; and '''[[eisbock]]''', a much stronger version made by partially freezing the beer and removing the water ice that forms.

Originally a dark beer, a modern bock can range from light copper to brown in colour.&lt;ref name=bjcp&gt;{{Cite book  | title = 2008 Beer Judge Certification Program (BJCP)Style Guidelines for Beer, Mead and Cider (2008 Revision of the 2004 Guidelines)  | publisher = BJCP  | year = 2008  |  url = http://www.bjcp.org/docs/2008_Guidelines.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; The style is very popular, with many examples brewed internationally.

==History==
The style known now as ''bock'' was a dark, malty, lightly hopped [[ale]] first brewed in the 14th century by German brewers in the [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic]] town of [[Einbeck]].&lt;ref name=Jackson&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.beerhunter.com/documents/19133-000034.html |title=Michael Jackson's Beer Hunter - Original Bock: the beer the doctor ordered |publisher=www.beerhunter.com |accessdate=2010-10-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The style from Einbeck was later adopted by Munich brewers in the 17th century and adapted to the new [[lager]] style of brewing. The Bavarians of Munich pronounced &quot;Einbeck&quot; as &quot;ein Bock&quot; (&quot;a [[billy goat]]&quot;), and thus the beer became known as &quot;bock&quot;. To this day, as a visual pun, a goat often appears on bock labels.&lt;ref name=bjcp /&gt;  

Bock is historically associated with special occasions, often religious festivals such as Christmas, Easter or Lent. Bocks have a long history of being brewed and consumed by Bavarian monks as a source of nutrition during times of fasting.&lt;ref name=GBI&gt;{{Cite web  | title = Doppelbock  | publisher = German Beer Institute   | year = 2006  | url = http://www.germanbeerinstitute.com/Doppelbock.html  | accessdate = 2010-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The styles of bock==
[[Image:Ayinger celebrator db.jpg|thumb||left|Ayinger Celebrator Doppelbock. The goats on the label are a visual pun: ''ein bock'' means ''a billy goat''.]]

===Traditional bock===
Traditional bock is a sweet, relatively strong (6.3%–7.2% by volume), lightly hopped (20-27 [[IBUs]]) lager. The beer should be clear, and colour can range from light copper to brown, with a bountiful and persistent off-white head. The aroma should be malty and toasty, possibly with hints of alcohol, but no detectable hops or fruitiness. The mouthfeel is smooth, with low to moderate carbonation and no astringency. The taste is rich and toasty, sometimes with a bit of caramel. Again, hop presence is low to undetectable, providing just enough bitterness so that the sweetness is not cloying and the aftertaste is muted.&lt;ref name=bjcp /&gt;

===Maibock or helles bock===
The maibock style is a [[helles]] lager brewed to bock strength, therefore still as strong as traditional bock, but lighter in colour and with more hop presence. It is a fairly recent development compared to other styles of bock beers, frequently associated with springtime and the month of May. Colour can range from deep gold to light amber with a large, creamy, persistent white head, and moderate to moderately high carbonation, while alcohol content ranges from 6.3% to 7.4% by volume. The flavour is typically less malty than a traditional bock, and may be drier, hoppier, and more bitter, but still with a relatively low hop flavour, with a mild spicy or peppery quality from the hops, increased carbonation and alcohol content. Examples include  [[Augustiner]] Hellerbock, [[Hofbräuhaus|Hofbräu]] Maibock, and [[Stevens Point Brewery|Stevens Point]] Einbeck.

===Doppelbock===
''Doppelbock'' or ''double bock'' is a stronger version of traditional bock that was first brewed in Munich by the Paulaner monks, an order founded by [[Francis of Paola|St. Francis of Paula]].&lt;ref name=GBI /&gt; Historically, doppelbock was high in alcohol and sweet, thus serving as &quot;liquid bread&quot; for the monks during times of fasting, when solid food was not permitted. Today, doppelbock is still strong—ranging from 7%–12% or more by volume. It is clear, with colour ranging from dark gold, for the paler version, to dark brown with ruby highlights for darker version. It has a large, creamy, persistent head (although head retention may be impaired by alcohol in the stronger versions). The aroma is intensely malty, with some toasty notes, and possibly some alcohol presence as well; darker versions may have a chocolate-like or fruity aroma. The flavour is very rich and malty, with toasty notes and noticeable alcoholic strength, and little or no detectable hops (16–26 IBUs). Paler versions may have a drier finish. The monks who originally brewed doppelbock named their beer &quot;Salvator&quot; (&quot;Savior&quot;), which today is trademarked by [[Paulaner]].&lt;ref name=GBI /&gt; Brewers of modern dopplebocks often add &quot;[[wikt:-ator|-ator]]&quot; to their beer's name as a signpost of the style; there are 200 &quot;-ator&quot; doppelbock names registered with the German patent office.&lt;ref name=GBI /&gt; The BJCP suggests that the following are representative examples of the style: Paulaner Salvator, [[Ayinger]] Celebrator, [[Weihenstephaner]] Korbinian, Andechser Doppelbock Dunkel, [[Spaten]] Optimator, Tucher Bajuvator, Weltenburger Kloster Asam-Bock, Capital Autumnal Fire, EKU 28, [[Eggenberg]] Urbock 23º, Bell’s Consecrator, [[Moretti]] La Rossa, [[Samuel Adams]] Double Bock.&lt;ref name=bjcp /&gt;

===Eisbock===
[[Image:Aventinus Weizen-Eisbock.jpg|thumb|right|Eisbock beer, made by removing ice from partially frozen barrels of beer, resulting in higher alcohol content.]]
Eisbock is a traditional specialty beer of the [[Kulmbach (district)|Kulmbach district]] of Germany that is made by [[freeze distillation|partially freezing]] a doppelbock and removing the water ice to concentrate the flavour and alcohol content, which ranges from 9% to 13% by volume.  It is clear, with a colour ranging from deep copper to dark brown in colour, often with ruby highlights. Although it can pour with a thin off-white head, head retention is frequently impaired by the higher alcohol content. The aroma is intense, with no hop presence, but frequently can contain fruity notes, especially of prunes, raisins, and plums. Mouthfeel is full and smooth, with significant alcohol, although this should not be hot or sharp. The flavour is rich and sweet, often with toasty notes, and sometimes hints of chocolate, always balanced by a significant alcohol presence.&lt;ref name = bjcp /&gt; Examples include [[G. Schneider &amp; Sohn|Schneider]] Aventinus Eisbock, Kulmbacher Reichelbrau Eisbock and [[Schloss Eggenberg|Eggenberg]] Urbock Dunkel Eisbock.

==International variations==
;Austria
In Austria, bockbier is traditionally brewed only around Christmas and Easter, when nearly every brewery brews its own bock.

;Argentina
There are several beers brewed in Argentina which are termed bock, including ''Araucana Negra Bock'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ratebeer.com/beer/araucana-negra-bock/57965/ |title=Araucana Negra Bock |publisher=www.ratebeer.com |accessdate=2010-10-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Quilmes Bock'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ratebeer.com/beer/quilmes-bock/7156/ |title=Quilmes Bock |publisher=www.ratebeer.com |accessdate=2010-10-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  and ''Blest Bock''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ratebeer.com/beer/blest-bock/19389/ |title=Blest Bock |publisher=www.ratebeer.com |accessdate=2010-10-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Belgium
A number of boks are produced, including  [[Chouffe]] Bok and &quot;Leute Bok&quot; from the Van Steenberge brewer, brewed since 1927.  Belgium-based [[InBev]] produces Artois Bock,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.realbeer.com/news/articles/news-002578.php ''Real Beer' on Artois Bock]&lt;/ref&gt; which is exported internationally and can be found in areas where bock is not traditionally available.

;Brazil
In Brazil, Kaiser is one of the breweries that sells bock beer, called ''Kaiser Bock''. This beer is available only in the months of fall and winter (April to September). Usually Brazilian bocks are produced by local breweries or craft breweries, especially in the cities of German settlement in Santa Catarina State and also in Petrópolis, state of Rio de Janeiro.

;Bulgaria
[[Zagorka Brewery]] produces ''Stolichno Bock Beer'', a 6.5% [[abv]] beer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ratebeer.com/beer/stolichno-temno-bock/37568/ |title=Stolichno Temno (Bock) |publisher=www.ratebeer.com |accessdate=2010-10-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Canada
Bock is a popular style, made by breweries across the country, including: 
*Phillips Brewing Company, [[Victoria, BC]]: &quot;Instigator&quot;, a seasonal doppelbock (8.5% abv)
*[[Creemore Springs]] Brewery, Creemore, Ontario: &quot;urBock&quot;, a Christmas season bock

[[Kunstmann]] Brewery from [[Valdivia, Chile|Valdivia]] produces a dark, bittersweet version of bock.

[[Kross]] brewery from Curacavi is producing a maibock (6.3% abv)

;England
Bock is an unusual style in the [[UK]], but a few examples exist. The [[Robert Cains brewery]] in Liverpool brews Cains Double Bock beer at 8 % ABV, and the [[Dark Star Brewery]], [[West Sussex]],  produce a 5.6%ABV  Maibock.

;Mexico
Bock beer is produced in Mexico around Christmas season, under the Noche Buena label.

;Namibia
Bock beer is produced and distributed under the Urbock label by Namibian Breweries. Like other Namibian Breweries beers, it is available in some of the neighbouring countries in Southern Africa, especially South Africa. The brewery also produces a maibock sporadically.

;Netherlands
A variation of bock called 'bokbier' is also brewed extensively in the Netherlands and occasionally in Belgium. Most larger Dutch breweries, such as [[Heineken International]], [[Grolsch]], [[Amstel Brewery|Amstel]], [[Alfa Brouwerij]],  [[Brand]] and [[Dommelsch]], market at least one variety. Most bokbiers tend to be seasonal beers (traditionally autumn, although there are currently also spring, summer and winter boks). They are among the only few specialty beers that existed besides lager for a long time. Microbreweries may prefer to seasonally brew a bokbier, such as the eco-beer biobok, made in autumn by [[Brouwerij 't IJ]] in Amsterdam. The consumers' organization [[PINT]] holds a bok festival every winter at the Beurs in Amsterdam.

;Norway
Bocks are also brewed in Norway, where they are known as &quot;bokkøl&quot; (bockbeers) and available during the whole year. Notable examples of bock brands are [[Aass]], [[Borg Bryggerier|Borg]], [[Frydenlund]] and [[Mack Brewery|Mack]].

;United States
Bock and its substyles are popular in all parts of the country. A short list includes:
*[[Bockfest]] - The city of [[Cincinnati, Ohio]], has hosted a celebration called [[Bockfest]] since 1992 that promotes its German-style brewing history and the German culture of its [[Over-the-Rhine]] neighbourhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bockfest.com/ |title=bockfest.com |publisher=bockfest.com |accessdate=2010-10-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Over-the-Rhine Brewery District]] has the largest collection of pre-[[Prohibition]] beer breweries in the world.
*[[Michelob]] (owned by [[Anheuser-Busch]]), introduced ''Amber Bock'' in 1997.
*[[Anchor Steam Beer]] (San Francisco, CA) introduced Anchor Bock Beer in 2005. It employs a 2-row barley/wheat malt process. Alcohol by volume is 5.5%. It is  released &quot;in celebration of the coming of spring,&quot; and available January–April.
*[[Samuel Adams (beer)|The Boston Beer Company]], under its &quot;Samuel Adams&quot; label, brews a seasonal ''Chocolate Bock'', and has been brewing ''Double Bock'' since 1988.
*Narragansett Brewing Co. (Providence, Rhode Island) has been making a bock beer since the repeal of Prohibition in the 1930s, and celebrated the start of spring with annual Bock Beer festivals at the brewery until 1977.

The  [[Bantu languages]] form a large category of African languages. '''Bantu''' also is used as a general label for 300-600 [[ethnic groups in Africa]] of speakers of Bantu languages, distributed from [[Cameroon]] east across [[Central Africa]] and [[Eastern Africa]] to [[Southern Africa]].  They form about 1/3 of Africa's total population of estimated 2007 population of about 1 billion (approximately 335,000,000).{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

The Bantu family is fragmented into hundreds of individual groups, none of them larger than a few million people (the largest being the [[Zulu language|Zulu]] with some 10 million). [[Swahili language|Swahili]] is a Bantu language with only 5-10 million native speakers but of super-regional importance as tens of millions are fluent second language speakers.

==Name==
Bantu or its various forms means ''the people'' or ''humans'' The word occurs in all Bantu languages in various, forms for example: it appears as ''watu'' in [[Swahili language|Swahili]], ''bato'' in [[Lingala language|Lingala]], ''abantu'' in [[Zulu language|Zulu]] and [[Luganda]], ''Vanhu'' in [[Shona language|Shona]] and ''Vandu'' in some [[Luhya language|Luhya]] dialects.

==Origins and expansion==

Current scholarly understanding places the ancestral proto-Bantu homeland near the southwestern modern boundary of Nigeria and Cameroon ca. 4,000 years ago (2000 BC), and regards the Bantu languages as a branch of the [[Niger-Congo languages|Niger-Congo]] [[language family]].&lt;ref&gt;Erhet &amp; Posnansky, eds. (1982), Newman (1995)&lt;/ref&gt; This view represents a resolution of debates in the 1960s over competing theories advanced by [[Joseph Greenberg]] and [[Malcolm Guthrie]], in favor of refinements of Greenberg's theory. Based on wide comparisons including non-Bantu languages, Greenberg argued that [[Proto-Bantu]], the hypothetical ancestor of the Bantu languages, had strong ancestral affinities with a group of languages spoken in Southeastern [[Nigeria]]. He proposed that Bantu languages had spread east and south from there, to secondary centers of further dispersion, over hundreds of years.

[[Image:East and southern africa early iron age.png|thumb|left|280px|Early Iron Age findings in eastern and southern Africa]]
Using a different comparative method focused more exclusively on relationships among Bantu languages, Guthrie argued for a single central African dispersal point spreading at a roughly equal rate in all directions. Subsequent research on loanwords for adaptations in agriculture and animal husbandry and on the wider Niger-Congo language family rendered that thesis untenable. In the 1990s [[Jan Vansina]] proposed a modification of Greenberg's ideas, in which dispersions from secondary and tertiary centers resembled Guthrie's central node idea, but from a number of regional centers rather than just one, creating linguistic clusters.&lt;ref&gt;Vansina (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the expansion of farming and herding peoples, including those speaking Bantu languages, [[Africa]] south of the equator was populated by [[neolithic]] hunting and foraging peoples. Some of them were ancestral to modern Central African forest peoples (so-called [[Pygmies]]) who now speak Bantu languages. Others were proto-[[Khoisan languages|Khoisan]]-speaking peoples, whose few modern hunter-forager and linguistic descendants today occupy the arid regions around the [[Kalahari]] desert. Many more [[Khoekhoe]] and [[Bushmen|San]] descendants have a [[Coloured]] identity in [[South Africa]] and [[Namibia]], speaking [[Afrikaans]] and [[English language|English]]. The small [[Hadza]] and [[Sandawe]]-speaking populations in [[Tanzania]], whose languages are proposed by many to have a distant relationship to Khoekhoe and San languages (although the hypothesis that the Khoisan languages are a single family is disputed by many, and the name is simply used for convenience), comprise the other modern hunter-forager remnant in [[Africa]].

Over a period of many centuries, most hunting-foraging peoples were displaced and absorbed by incoming Bantu-speaking communities, as well as by Ubangian, Nilotic and Central Sudanic language-speakers in North Central and Eastern Africa.

[[File:Mozambique001.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A [[Makua people|Makua]] mother and child in [[Mozambique]].]]
While earliest archaeological evidence of farming and herding in today's Bantu language areas often is presumed to reflect spread of Bantu-speaking communities, it need not always do so.&lt;ref&gt;Ehret (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Bantu people|Bantu]] expansion was a long series of physical migrations, a diffusion of language and knowledge out into and in from neighboring populations, and a creation of new societal groups involving inter-marriage among communities and small groups moving to communities and small groups moving to new areas. Bantu-speakers developed novel methods of [[agriculture]] and [[metalworking]] in both iron and copper which allowed people to colonize new areas with widely varying ecologies in greater densities than hunting and foraging permitted.

The [[Bantu people|Bantu]] diffused food producing techniques, of high-yield crops.

Meanwhile in Eastern and Southern Africa Bantu-speakers spread livestock husbandry to hunter-foragers, so that herding reached the far south several centuries before Bantu-speaking migrants did. [[archaeology|Archaeological]], [[linguistics|linguistic]] and [[genetics|genetic]] evidence all support the idea that the Bantu expansion was one of the most significant human migrations and cultural transformations within the past few thousand years.

It is unclear when exactly the spread of Bantu-speakers began from their core area as hypothesized ca. 5,000 years ago. By 3,500 years ago (1500 B.C.) in the west, Bantu-speaking communities had reached the great Central African rain forest, and by 2,500 year ago (500 B.C.) pioneering groups had emerged into the [[savannah]]s to the south, in what are now the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]], [[Angola]] and [[Zambia]]. Another stream of migration, moving east, by 3,000 years ago (1000 B.C.) was creating a major new population center near the Great Lakes of East Africa, where a rich environment supported a dense population. Movements by small groups to the southeast from the Great Lakes region were more rapid, with initial settlements widely dispersed near the coast and near rivers, due to comparatively harsh farming conditions in areas farther from water. Pioneering groups had reached modern KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa by A.D. 300 along the coast, and the modern Northern Province (encompassed within the former province of the [[Transvaal Province|Transvaal]]) by A.D. 500.&lt;ref&gt;Newman (1995), Ehret (1998), Shillington (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

Between the 14th and 15th centuries powerful Bantu-speaking states began to emerge, in the Great Lakes region, in the savannah south of the Central African rainforest, and on the Zambezi river where the [[Monomatapa]] kings built the famous [[Great Zimbabwe]] complex. Such processes of state-formation occurred with increasing frequency from the 16th century onward. They were probably due to denser population, which led to more specialized divisions of labor, including military power, while making emigration more difficult, to increased trade among African communities and with [[China|Chinese]], [[Europe]]an, [[Indonesia]]n and [[Arab]] traders on the coasts, to technological developments in economic activity, and to new techniques in the political-spiritual ritualization of royalty as the source of national strength and health.&lt;ref&gt;Shillington (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

==The use of the term &quot;Bantu&quot; in South Africa==
{{Main|Bantu-speaking peoples of South Africa}}
In the 1920s relatively liberal white South Africans, missionaries and the small black intelligentsia began to use the term &quot;Bantu&quot; in preference to &quot;Native&quot; and more derogatory terms (such as &quot;[[Kaffir (racial term)|Kaffir]]&quot;) to refer collectively to Bantu-speaking South Africans. After [[World War II]], the racialist [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] governments adopted that usage officially, while the growing African nationalist movement and its liberal white allies turned to the term &quot;African&quot; instead, so that &quot;Bantu&quot; became identified with the policies of [[apartheid]]. By the 1970s this so discredited &quot;Bantu&quot; as an ethno-racial designation that the apartheid government switched to the term &quot;Black&quot; in its official racial categorizations, restricting it to Bantu-speaking Africans, at about the same time that the [[Black Consciousness Movement]] led by [[Steve Biko]] and others were defining &quot;Black&quot; to mean all racially oppressed South Africans (Africans, Coloureds and [[Asians in South Africa|Indians]]).

Examples of South African usages of &quot;Bantu&quot; include:

#One of South Africa's politicians of recent times, General Bantubonke Harrington Holomisa (Bantubonke is a [[compound noun]] meaning &quot;all the people&quot;), is known as [[Bantu Holomisa]].
#The South African apartheid governments originally gave the name &quot;[[bantustan]]s&quot; to the eleven rural reserve areas intended for a spurious, ''ersatz'' independence to deny Africans South African citizenship. &quot;Bantustan&quot; originally reflected an analogy to the various ethnic &quot;-stans&quot; of Western and Central Asia. Again association with apartheid discredited the term, and the South African government shifted to the politically appealing but historically deceptive term &quot;ethnic homelands&quot;. Meanwhile the anti-apartheid movement persisted in calling the areas bantustans, to drive home their political illegitimacy.
#The abstract noun ''[[Ubuntu (philosophy)|ubuntu]]'', humanity or humaneness, is derived regularly from the [[Nguni languages|Nguni]] noun stem ''-ntu'' in isiXhosa, isiZulu and siNdebele. In siSwati the stem is ''-ntfu'' and the noun is ''buntfu''.
#In the [[Sotho-Tswana languages]] of southern Africa, ''batho'' is the cognate term to Nguni ''abantu'', illustrating that such cognates need not actually look like the ''-ntu'' root exactly. The early [[African National Congress]] of South Africa had a newspaper called ''Abantu-Batho'' from 1912–1933, which carried columns in English, isiZulu, Sesotho, and isiXhosa.

The '''Bantu languages''' (technically '''Narrow Bantu languages''') constitute a traditional sub-branch of the [[Niger-Congo languages]]. There are about 250 Bantu languages by the criterion of [[mutual intelligibility]],&lt;ref&gt;Derek Nurse, 2006, &quot;Bantu Languages&quot;, in the ''Encyclopedia of Language and Linguistics''&lt;/ref&gt; though the distinction between language and dialect is often unclear, and ''Ethnologue'' counts 535 languages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_family.asp?subid=73-16 Ethnologue report for Southern Bantoid]. The figure of 535 includes the 13 [[Mbam languages]] considered Bantu in Guthrie's classification and thus counted by Nurse (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; Bantu languages are spoken largely east and south of the present day country of Cameroon; i.e., in the regions commonly known as central Africa, east Africa, and southern Africa. Parts of the Bantu area include languages from other language families (see map).

The Bantu language with the largest total number of speakers is [[Swahili language|Swahili]]. It has over 80 million speakers across eight countries and this number is growing.

According to [[Ethnologue]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/ethno_docs/distribution.asp?by=size]&lt;/ref&gt; the Bantu language with the largest number of speakers as a first language is [[Shona Language|Shona]] with 10.8 million speakers in Zimbabwe. [[Zulu language|Zulu]] comes second with 10.3 million speakers. Ethnologue lists Manyika and Ndau as separate languages, though Shona speakers consider them to be two of the five main dialects of Shona. If the 3.4 million Manyika and Ndau speakers are included among the Shona, then Shona totals 14.2 million first-language speakers. 

It is possible that the Bantu languages originated in the region of eastern [[Nigeria]] or [[Cameroon]]. Some estimate that about 2000 years ago the Bantu people spread southwards and eastwards, introducing agriculture and iron working and colonizing much of the continent in the [[Bantu expansion]].

The technical term Bantu, simply meaning &quot;people&quot;, was first used by [[Wilhelm Heinrich Immanuel Bleek]] (1827–1875) as this is reflected in many of the languages of this group. A common characteristic of Bantu languages is that they use words such as ''muntu'' or ''mutu'' for &quot;person&quot;, and the plural prefix for human nouns starting with ''mu-'' (class 1) in most languages is ''ba-'' (class 2), thus giving ''bantu'' for &quot;people&quot;. Bleek, and later [[Carl Meinhof]], pursued extensive studies comparing the grammatical structures of Bantu languages.

==Classification==
{{main|Guthrie classification of Bantu languages}}
[[Image:Bantu zones.png|thumb|left|295px|The approximate locations of the sixteen Guthrie Bantu zones, including the addition of a zone J]]

The term 'narrow Bantu'  was coined by the ''Benue-Congo Working Group'' to distinguish Bantu as recognized by [[Malcolm Guthrie]] in his seminal 1948 classification of the Bantu languages from [[Bantoid languages]] not recognized as Bantu by Guthrie (1948). In recent times, the distinctness of Narrow Bantu as opposed to the other [[Southern Bantoid]] groups has been called into doubt (cf. Piron 1995, Williamson &amp; Blench 2000), but the term is still widely used as the true situation has not been established. 

There is no genealogical classification of the (Narrow) Bantu languages. The most widely used system, the alphanumeric coding system developed by Guthrie, is mainly geographic. However, based on reflexes of proto-Bantu tone patterns, zones A–C and part of D are grouped together as [[Northwest Bantu]], and zones D–S as [[Central Bantu]]. Northwest Bantu is more divergent internally than Central Bantu, and perhaps less conservative due to contact with non-Bantu Niger-Congo languages; however, Central Bantu is likely the innovative line cladistically, with Northwest being the non-Central languages, not a family in their own right. Most attempted classifications are problematic as they consider only languages which happen to fall within traditional Narrow Bantu, rather than South Bantoid, which has been established, as a whole. 

The only attempt at a detailed genetic classification to replace the Guthrie system is the 1999 &quot;Tervuren&quot; proposal of Bastin, Coupez, and Mann.&lt;ref&gt;The Guthrie, Tervuren, and SIL lists are compared side by side in [http://www.african.gu.se/maho/downloads/bantulineup.pdf Maho 2002].&lt;/ref&gt; However, it relies on [[lexicostatistics]], which, because it relies on similarity, rather than [[synapomorphy|shared innovations]], can lead to grouping together [[polyphyly|conservative languages which are not closely related]]. Meanwhile, ''[[Ethnologue]]'' has added languages to the Guthrie classification that Guthrie overlooked, while removing the [[Mbam languages]] (much of zone A), and shifting some languages between groups (much of zones D and E to a new zone J, for example, and part of zone L to K, and part of M to F) in an apparent effort at a semi-genetic, or at least semi-areal, classification. However, zone S ([[Southern Bantu]]) does appear to be a coherent group. The languages which share [[Dahl's Law]] may also form a valid group, [[Northeast Bantu]]. The development of a rigorous genealogical classification of many subdivisions of Niger-Congo, not just Bantu, is hampered by insufficient data. Production of publications on all African languages has been spasmodic and many have never been documented at all, although no doubt used, valued, and celebrated as a mark of identity by those who speak them.

==Language structure==
Guthrie reconstructed both the phonemic inventory and the core vocabulary of Proto-Bantu. 

The most prominent [[grammar|grammatical]] characteristic of Bantu languages is the extensive use of [[affix]]es (see [[Sesotho grammar]] and [[Luganda language#Noun classes|Luganda language]] for detailed discussions of these affixes). Each noun belongs to a [[Noun class|class]], and each language may have several numbered classes, somewhat like [[Gender (grammar)|genders]] in European languages. The class is indicated by a prefix that's part of the noun, as well as agreement markers on verb and qualificative roots connected with the noun. Plural is indicated by a change of class, with a resulting change of prefix.

The verb has a number of prefixes, though in the western languages these are often treated as independent words. &lt;ref&gt;Derek Nurse, 2008. ''Tense and aspect in Bantu'', p 70 (fn). In many of the Zone A, including [[Mbam languages|Mbam]], the verbs are clearly analytic.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Swahili language|Swahili]], for example, ''Mtoto mdogo amekisoma'', (also ''Kamwana kadoko kariverenga'' in [[Shona language]]) means 'The small child has read it [a book]'. ''Mtoto'' 'child' governs the adjective prefix ''m-'' and the verb subject prefix ''a-''. Then comes perfect tense ''-me-'' and an object marker ''-ki-'' agreeing with implicit ''kitabu'' 'book'. Pluralizing to 'children' gives ''Watoto wadogo wamekisoma'' (''Vana vadoko variverenga'' in Shona), and [[plural]]izing to 'books' (''vitabu'') gives ''Watoto wadogo wamevisoma''. 

Bantu words are typically made up of [[open syllable]]s of the type CV (consonant-vowel) with most languages having syllables exclusively of this type. The '''Bushong''' language recorded by Vansina, however, has final consonants &lt;ref&gt; Vansina, J. ''Esquisse de Grammaire Bushong''    Commission de Linguistique Africaine, Tervuren, Belgique, 1959. &lt;/ref&gt;, while slurring of the final syllable (though written) is reported as common among the '''Tonga''' of Malawi &lt;ref&gt; Turner, Rev. Wm. Y., ''Tumbuka - Tonga English Dictionary''  Hetherwick Press, Blantyre, Malawi 1952. pages i - ii.  &lt;/ref&gt;. The morphological shape of Bantu words is typically CV, VCV, CVCV, VCVCV, etc.; that is, any combination of CV (with possibly a V- syllable at the start). In other words, a strong claim for this language family is that almost all words end in a vowel, precisely because closed syllables (CVC) are not permissible in most of the documented languages, as far as we are aware. This tendency to avoid [[consonant cluster]]s is some positions is important when words are imported from [[English language|English]] or other non-Bantu languages. An example from [[Chichewa]]: the word &quot;school&quot;, borrowed from English, and then transformed to fit the sound patterns of this language, is ''sukulu''. That is, ''sk-'' has been broken up by inserting an [[epenthesis|epenthetic]] ''-u-''; ''-u'' has also been added at the end of the word. Another example is ''buledi'' for &quot;bread&quot;. Similar effects are seen in [[loanwords]] for other non-African CV languages like [[Japanese language|Japanese]]. However, a clustering of sounds at the beginning of a syllable can be readily observed in such languages as Shona &lt;ref&gt; Doke, Clement M., ''A Comparative Study in Shona Phonetics''   University of Witwatersrand, Johannesberg, 1931. &lt;/ref&gt;, and the '''[[Emakhuwa]]''' variants &lt;ref&gt; ''Relatório do I Seminário sobre a Padronização da Ortografia de Línguas Moçambicanas''  NELIMO, Universidade Eduardo Mondlane. 1989. &lt;/ref&gt;. 

===Reduplication===
[[Reduplication]] is a common morphological phenomenon in Bantu languages and is usually used to indicate frequency or intensity of the action signalled by the (unreduplicated) verb stem [http://www.african.gu.se/aa/pdfs/aa02004.pdf]
 
*Example: in Swahili ''piga'' means &quot;strike&quot;, ''pigapiga'' means &quot;strike repeatedly&quot;.

Well-known words and names that have reduplication include
* [[Bafana Bafana]]
* [[Chipolopolo]]
* [[Eric Djemba-Djemba]]
* [[Lomana LuaLua|Lualua]]
* [[Ngorongoro]]
* [[Polepole]] (Swahili for slowly, or slowly-slowly). - In swahili pole means sorry, to express sympathy.
* [[Haraka-haraka]] (Swahili for quickly, or quickly-quickly, compare with vite-vite in French, that has the approximate meaning to 'fast-fast' in English).
Repetition emphasizes the repeated word in the context that it is used. For instance, &quot;Mwenda pole hajikwai,&quot; while, &quot;Pole pole ndio mwendo,&quot; has two to emphasize the consistency of slowness of the pace. The meaning of the former in translation is, &quot;He who goes slowly doesn't trip,&quot; and that of the latter is, &quot;A slow but steady pace wins the race.&quot; Haraka haraka would mean hurrying just for the sake of hurrying, reckless hurry, as in &quot;Njoo! Haraka haraka&quot; [come here! Hurry, hurry].

On the contrary to the above definition, there are some words in some of the languages in which reduplication has the opposite meaning. It usually denotes short durations, and or lower intensity of the action and also means a few repetitions or a little bit more.

*Example 1: in isiZulu and SiSwati ''hamba'' means &quot;go&quot;, ''hambahamba'' means &quot;go-go meaning go a little bit, but not much&quot;.

*Example 2: in both of the above languages ''shaya'' means &quot;strike&quot;, ''shayashaya'' means &quot;strike-strike, meaning strike a few more times lightly, but not heavy strikes and not too many times&quot;

==Notable Bantu languages==
Following are the principal Bantu languages of each country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.org According to Ethnologue]&lt;/ref&gt; These are those languages with at least 10% the number of speakers of the main Bantu language in the country, as long as that constitutes at least 1% of the population. 

Most languages are best known in English without the class prefix (''Swahili'', ''Tswana'', ''Ndebele''), but are sometimes seen with the (language-specific) prefix (''Kiswahili'', ''Setswana'', ''Sindebele''). In a few cases prefixes are used to distinguish languages with the same root in their name, such as [[Tshiluba]] and [[Kiluba]] (both ''Luba''), [[Umbundu]] and [[Kimbundu]] (both ''Mbundu''). The bare (prefixless) form typically does not occur in the language itself, but is the basis for other words based on the ethnicity. So, in the country of [[Botswana]] the people are the ''[[Batswana]]'', one person is a ''Motswana'', and the language is ''[[Setswana]]''; and in [[Uganda]], centered on the kingdom of ''[[Buganda]]'', the dominant ethnicity are the ''[[Baganda]]'' (sg. ''Muganda''), whose language is ''[[Luganda]]''.

[[File:BOMARC A Surface-to-Air Missile.jpg|right|thumb|A Bomarc missile]]
{{kml}}
The '''CIM-10 Bomarc''' was the only [[surface-to-air missile]] (SAM) ever deployed by the [[United States Air Force]]. All other U.S. land-based SAMs were and are under the control of the [[United States Army]].

The supersonic Bomarc missiles were the first long-range [[anti-aircraft missiles]] in the world. They were capable of carrying conventional or [[nuclear weapon|nuclear]] warheads. Their intended role in defense was in an intrusion prevention perimeter. Bomarcs aligned on the eastern and western coasts of North America would theoretically launch and destroy enemy bombers before the bombers could drop their payloads on industrial regions.

It involved the deployment of tactical stations armed with Bomarc missiles along the east and west coasts of [[North America]] and the central areas of the continent. BOMARC and the [[Semi Automatic Ground Environment|SAGE]] guidance system were phased out in the early 1970s since they seemed to be ineffective and costly. Neither of these systems was ever used in combat, so while their combat effectiveness remains untested, they are still perceived as having been an important deterrent.

In addition to the USAF, the Bomarc was also deployed by [[Canada]] after the country had canceled its advanced [[Avro Canada CF-105 Arrow]] manned interceptor in 1959.

==History==
===Origins and development===
In 1946, [[Boeing]] started to study surface-to-air guided missiles under the [[United States Army Air Forces]] project MX-606. By 1950, Boeing had launched more than 100 test rockets in various configurations, all under the designator XSAM-A-1 GAPA (Ground-to-Air Pilotless Aircraft). Because these tests were very promising, Boeing received a USAF contract in 1949 to develop a pilotless interceptor (a term then used by the USAF for air-defense guided missiles) under project MX-1599. The MX-1599 missile was to be a ramjet-powered, nuclear-armed long-range surface-to-air missile to defend the Continental United States from high-flying bombers. The Michigan Aerospace Research Center (MARC) was added to the project soon afterward, and this gave the new missile its name Bomarc (for Boeing and MARC). In 1951, the USAF decided to emphasize its point of view that missiles were nothing else than pilotless aircraft by assigning aircraft designators to its missile projects, and anti-aircraft missiles received F-for-Fighter designations. The Bomarc became the '''F-99'''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gibson&quot;&gt;Gibson 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

Test flights of XF-99 test vehicles began in September 1952 and continued through early 1955. The XF-99 tested only the liquid-fueled booster rocket, which would accelerate the missile to ramjet ignition speed. In February 1955, tests of the XF-99A propulsion test vehicles began. These included live ramjets, but still had no guidance system or warhead. The designation YF-99A had been reserved for the operational test vehicles. In August 1955, the USAF discontinued the use of aircraft-like type designators for missiles, and the XF-99A and YF-99A became XIM-99A and YIM-99A, respectively. Originally the USAF had allocated the designation IM-69, but this was changed (possibly at Boeing's request to keep number 99) to '''IM-99''' in October 1955. In October 1957, the first YIM-99A production-representative prototype flew with full guidance, and succeeded to pass the target within destructive range. In late 1957, Boeing received the production contract for the IM-99A Bomarc A interceptor missile, and in September 1959, the first IM-99A squadron became operational.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gibson&quot;/&gt;

The IM-99A had an operational radius of 200 miles (~320&amp;nbsp;km) and was designed to fly at [[Mach number|Mach]] 2.5-2.8 at a cruising altitude of 60,000 feet (18.3&amp;nbsp;km). It was 46.6&amp;nbsp;ft (14.2 m) long and weighed 15,500&amp;nbsp;lb (7,020&amp;nbsp;kg). Its armament was either a 1,000 pound (455&amp;nbsp;kg) conventional warhead or a [[W40]] nuclear warhead (7-10 [[kiloton]] yield). A liquid fuelled [[rocket]] engine boosted the Bomarc to Mach 2, when its [[Marquardt RJ43-MA]]-3 [[ramjet]] engines, fueled by 80-octane gasoline, would take over for the remainder of the flight.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gibson&quot;/&gt;

===Manufacture and operational deployment===
The operational IM-99A missiles were based horizontally in semi-hardened shelters (&quot;coffins&quot;). After the launch order, the shelter's roof would slide open, and the missile raised to the vertical. After the missile was supplied with fuel for the booster rocket, it would be launched by the Aerojet General LR59-AJ-13 booster. After supersonic speed was reached, the Marquardt RJ43-MA-3 ramjets would ignite and propel the missile to its cruise speed and altitude of Mach 2.8 at 20000&amp;nbsp;m (65000&amp;nbsp;ft).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gibson&quot;/&gt;

[[File:CIM-10 Bomarc missile battery.jpg|thumb|Bomarc missile site]]

When the Bomarc was within 16&amp;nbsp;km (10 miles) of the target, its own Westinghouse AN/DPN-34 radar guided the missile to the interception point. The maximum range of the IM-99A was 400&amp;nbsp;km (250 miles), and it was fitted with either a conventional high-explosive or a 10&amp;nbsp;kt W-40 nuclear fission warhead.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gibson&quot;/&gt;

The Bomarc relied on the [[Semi Automatic Ground Environment]] (SAGE), an automated control system used by [[North American Aerospace Defense Command|NORAD]] for detecting, tracking and intercepting enemy [[bomber aircraft]]. SAGE allowed for remote launching of the Bomarc missiles, which were housed in a constant combat-ready basis in individual launch shelters in remote areas. At the height of the program, there were 14 Bomarc sites located in the United States and two in Canada.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gibson&quot;/&gt;

The liquid-fuel booster of the Bomarc A was no optimal solution. It took two minutes to fuel before launch, which can be a long time in high-speed intercepts, and its [[hypergolic]] fuels were very dangerous to handle, leading to several serious accidents.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gibson&quot;/&gt;

As soon as high-thrust solid-fuel rockets became a reality in the mid-1950s, the USAF began to develop a new solid-fueled Bomarc variant, the IM-99B Bomarc B. It used a Thiokol XM51 booster, and also had improved Marquardt RJ43-MA-7 (and finally the RJ43-MA-11) ramjets. The first IM-99B was launched in May 1959, but problems with the new propulsion system delayed the first fully successful flight until July 1960, when a supersonic KD2U-1/MQM-15A Regulus II drone was intercepted. Because the new booster took up less space in the missile, more ramjet fuel could be carried, increasing the range to 710&amp;nbsp;km (440 miles). The terminal homing system was also improved, using the world's first pulse doppler search radar, the Westinghouse AN/DPN-53. All Bomarc Bs were equipped with the W-40 nuclear warhead. In June 1961, the first IM-99B squadron became operational, and Bomarc B quickly replaced most Bomarc A missiles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gibson&quot;/&gt;

Boeing built 570 Bomarc missiles between 1957 and 1964, 269 CIM-10A, 301 CIM-10B.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gibson&quot;/&gt;

[[File:4751st Air Defense Squadron - ADC - Emblem.png|left|thumb|125px|4751st ADMS (Training) Emblem]]
In September 1958 Air Research &amp; Development Command decided to transfer the Bomarc program from its testing at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station to a new facility on [[Santa Rosa Island, Florida|Santa Rosa Island]], immediately south of Eglin AFB [[Hurlburt Field]] on the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. To operate the facility and to provide training and operational evaluation in the missile program, [[Air Defense Command]] established the 4751st Air Defense Wing (Missile) (4751st ADW) on 15 January 1958. The first launch from Santa Rosa took place on 15 January 1959.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gibson&quot;/&gt;

The first USAF operational Bomarc squadron was the [[46th Air Defense Missile Squadron]] (ADMS), organized on 1 January 1959 and activated on 25 March. The 46th ADMS was assigned to the [[New York Air Defense Sector]] at [[McGuire AFB]], [[New Jersey]]. The training program, under the 4751st ADW used technicians acting as instructors and was established for a four month duration. Training included missile maintenance; [[Semi Automatic Ground Environment|SAGE]] operations and launch procedures, including the launch of an unarmed missile at Eglin. In September 1959 the squadron assembled at their permanent station, the Bomarc site near McGuire AFB, and trained for operational readiness. The first Bomarc-A went operational at McGuire on 19 September 1959 with Kincheloe AFB getting the first operational IM-99Bs. While several of the squadrons replicated earlier fighter interceptor unit numbers, they were all new organizations with no previous historical counterpart.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radomes.org/museum/documents/McGuireAFBBOMARCNJ1960NYADShistory.html &quot;46th Air Defense Missile Squadron.&quot;] ''NYADS 1960 Yearbook.'' Retrieved: 28 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

ADC's initial plans called for some 52 Bomarc sites around the United States with 120 missiles each but as defense budgets decreased during the 1950s the number of sites dropped substantially. Ongoing development and reliability problems didn't help; nor did Congressional debate over the missile's usefulness and necessity. In June 1959, the Air Force authorized 16 Bomarc sites with 56 missiles each; the initial five would get the IM-99A with the remainder getting the IM-99B. However, in March 1960, HQ USAF cut deployment to eight sites in the US and two in Canada.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gibson&quot;/&gt;

===Canada and the Bomarc===
The Bomarc Missile Program was highly controversial in Canada. The [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservative]] government of [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[John Diefenbaker]] initially agreed to deploy the missiles, and shortly thereafter controversially scrapped the [[Avro Arrow]], a supersonic manned interceptor aircraft, arguing that the missile program made the Arrow unnecessary.

Initially, it was unclear whether the missiles would be equipped with nuclear warheads. By 1960 it became known that the missiles were to have a nuclear payload, and a debate ensued about whether Canada should accept nuclear weapons. Ultimately, the Diefenbaker government decided that the Bomarcs should not be equipped with conventional warheads. The dispute split the Diefenbaker [[Canadian Cabinet|Cabinet]], and led to the collapse of the government in 1963. The Opposition [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]] argued in favour of accepting nuclear warheads and, after winning the [[Canadian federal election, 1963|1963 election]], the new Liberal government of [[Lester Pearson]] proceeded to accept nuclear-armed Bomarcs, with the first being deployed on 31 December 1963.

[[Pierre Trudeau]], still working as a journalist, attacked Pearson for the decision. While he was forced to reverse himself when he decided to run as a candidate for the Liberals in the [[Canadian federal election, 1965|1965 election]], he remained unenthusiastic. Shortly after becoming prime minister in 1968, he announced that the missiles would be phased out by 1971.

===Operational service and retirement===
Within a year of becoming operational, a Bomarc-A with a nuclear warhead caught fire at McGuire AFB on 7 June 1960 following the explosive rupture of its onboard helium tank. While the missile's explosives didn't detonate, the heat melted the warhead, releasing plutonium which the fire crews then spread around. The Air Force and the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] cleaned up the site and covered it with concrete; fortunately, this was the only major incident involving the weapons system.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gibson&quot;/&gt; The site remained in operation for several years following the fire, but after its closure in 1972, the accident resulted in that area remaining off limits to the present day, primarily due to low levels of plutonium contamination.&lt;ref&gt;Gambardello, Joseph A. [http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-5763528_ITM &quot;Plutonium Spill Neither Gone Nor Forgotten, 40 Years Later.&quot;] ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'', 1 June 2000, p. A01. Retrieved: 26 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962 the Air Force started using modified A-models as drones; following the October 1962 tri-service redesignation of aircraft and weapons systems they became CQM-10As. Otherwise the air defense missile squadrons maintained alert while making regular trips to Santa Rosa Island for training and firing practice. After the inactivation of the 4751st ADW(M) on 1 July 1962 and transfer of Hurlburt to [[Tactical Air Command]] for air commando operations the 4751st Air Defense Squadron (Missile) remained at Hurlburt and Santa Rosa Island for training purposes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gibson&quot;/&gt;

In 1964, the liquid-fueled Bomarc-A sites and squadrons began to be inactivated. The sites at Dow and Suffolk County closed first. The remainder soldiered on for several more years while the government started dismantling the air defense missile network. Niagara Falls was the first BOMARC B installation to close, in December 1969; the others remained on alert through 1972. In April 1972, the last Bomarc B in USAF service was retired at McGuire and the 46th ADMS inactivated.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gibson&quot;/&gt;

[[File:CQM-10B Bormarc drone launch Vandenberg 1977.JPEG|thumb|A CQM-10B drone launched at [[Vandenberg Air Force Base]], 1977.]]

The Bomarc, designed to intercept relatively slow manned bombers, had become a useless asset in the era of the intercontinental ballistic missile. The remaining Bomarc missiles were used by all armed services as high-speed target drones for tests of other air-defense missiles. The Bomarc A and Bomarc B targets were designated as CQM-10A and CQM-10B, respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gibson&quot;/&gt;

Notably, due to the accident the McGuire complex has never been sold or converted to other uses and remains in Air Force ownership, making it the most intact site of the eight in the United States. It has been nominated to the National Register of Historic Sites. Although a number of IM-99/CIM-10 Bomarcs have been placed on public display, concerns about the possible environmental hazards of the [[Mag-Thor|thoriated magnesium]] structure of the airframe have resulted in several being removed from public view.&lt;ref name=NorthBay12092009&gt;Young, Gord.

Retrieved: 24 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Russ Sneddon, director of the [[Air Force Armament Museum]], [[Eglin AFB]], Florida provided information about missing CIM-10 exhibit airframe serial 59-2016, one of the museum's original artifacts from its founding in 1975 and donated by the 4751st Air Defense Squadron at [[Hurlburt Field]], Eglin Auxiliary Field 9, Eglin AFB. As of December 2006, the suspect missile was stored in a secure compound behind the Armaments Museum. In December 2010, the airframe was still on premises, but partially dismantled.

The '''Rio Branco''' (engl. White river) is the principal [[Tributary|affluent]] of the [[Rio Negro (Amazon)|Rio Negro]] (engl. Black river) from the north; it is enriched by many streams from the sierras which separate [[Venezuela]] and [[Guyana]] from [[Brazil]]. Its two upper main tributaries are the [[Urariquira River|Urariquira]] and the [[Takutu River|Takutu]]. The latter almost links its sources with those of the [[Essequibo River|Essequibo]].

The Branco flows nearly south, and finds its way into the Negro through several channels and a chain of lagoons similar to those of the latter river. It is {{convert|350|mi|km}} long, up to its Urariquira confluence. It has numerous islands, and, {{convert|235|mi|km}} above its mouth, it is broken by a bad series of rapids.

As far as our server can handle it, we like to increase traffic to [[Wikipedia]]: it helps improve the quality and quantity of the content and increases the total amount of joy and other utility it has for people. This page lists ways of doing this.

----

Let's talk about how to increase [[traffic]] to Wikipedia, of both readers and writers--that is now going to become one of the main focuses of my Wikipedia work.  So I want your help!  How can we increase &quot;membership&quot; in Wikipedia--both readers ''and'' new writers?

Let's brainstorm.  Please, add an idea below, or help develop ideas.  (Sometimes, a really great new idea is a slight variation on a just-OK old idea.)

Also, if you do any work that you think someone else might inadvertently replicate, can you please write it down here somehow (as on the [[Wikipedia:Building Wikipedia membership/Encyclopedia links solicited|Encyclopedia links solicited]] page)?  Thanks! --[[User:Larry Sanger|Larry Sanger]]

==Urban poster campaign==
See [[meta:Wikimedia urban postering campaign]]!

==Brainstormin'==
* How about we do something like [[Spread Firefox]]? We could start our own publicity campaign, and if we ever get something like the NYT ad or the Firefox coins (see article) then I get the feeling wikipedia use would go WAY up! :D
[[User:203.59.117.99|203.59.117.99]] 08:35, 22 August 2005 (UTC)
* Solicit links from (mentioning [[Wikipedia:Wikipedia banners and logos]]):
** Websites with substantial traffic, like [[Wikipedia:Building Wikipedia membership/About.com|About.com]] (see [[Wikipedia:Building Wikipedia membership/Big traffic links solicited|Big traffic links solicited]])
** People with lists of encyclopedias (see [[Wikipedia:Building Wikipedia membership/Encyclopedia list links solicited|Encyclopedia list links solicited]])
** People with encyclopedia-type websites (see [[Wikipedia:Building Wikipedia membership/Encyclopedia links solicited|Encyclopedia links solicited]])
** Best-of websites and similar resources (see [[Wikipedia:Building Wikipedia membership/Best of sites links solicited|Best of sites links solicited]])
** Web sites for authors, films, whatever. There's always a list of links. Add a link to the Wikipedia Stephen King page to Stephen King web sites, to the Japan page on Japan web sites, and so on. 

* for individual articles, solicit links from:
** related resources (particularly if we mention them in ''external links'')
** directories such as [[LookSmart]], [[Open Directory Project]] and [[Yahoo!]]

* Get people to add article review requests to [[User:Larry Sanger/Review requests]]; find reviewers for those articles.

* Approach websites that might want free content, and help them to get their hands on Wikipedia's; this is something Bomis programmers and volunteers could work on.  Maybe after we're running Magnus' PHP code?

* Post announcements on mailing lists.  But of what sort?  Obviously, we want to avoid spam.
** Start ''and continue'' discussions about Wikipedia articles (for this, the help of Wikipedians will be necessary)
** Simply announce the existence of Wikipedia, soliciting help.  I think this is actually plausible.
** Recruit fans for specific areas of Wikipedia. For example, someone could drop by a [[Star Trek]] newsgroup and mention that our pages need work. I bet we'd have a huge Star Trek section in no time...

* Possible solicitation letters:
**[[/Sample solicitation]]
**[[/Another sample solicitation]]
**[[/Sample solicitation 3]]
**[[/Skeptical solicitation]]

* Post announcements on newsgroups.  But try to be careful to go slowly through them--make sure the post is specially-tailored to whatever group you post to.  A good strategy is to pick a Wikipedia article, point out a few problems with it, and post a link to the article, inviting people to make changes.  If you have posted an announcement to a newsgroup, will you please list it here: [[Wikipedia:Building Wikipedia membership/Newsgroups|Newsgroups]]. If you don't know much about newsgroups, go to http://groups.google.com.

* Contact webmasters who have content-rich sites.  Get them excited about Wikipedia, and invite them to make their content part of something great.

* Increase production of pages that are of interest to the search engines.  '''Look at [http://50.lycos.com/ the Lycos 50] and the [http://www.google.com/press/zeitgeist.html Google Zeitgeist] and make sure that there are articles on all those topics.'''  I would say that writing some simple short biographies of famous people would help. It will help when we have reliable and regularly updated stats on what is popular.  One interesting thing about this is that other people may follow suit so that there is a &quot;trend&quot; on the site.

* Increase the standing of Wikipedia with Bomis.  (There is a bug in the system which means that Wikipedia articles are not returned as often as they could be.  We're working on this.)

* Work to get additional press coverage, following up on the NYT article as best we can.  [[Wikipedia:Building Wikipedia membership/Ideas for articles about Wikipedia and other press events|Ideas for articles about Wikipedia and other press events]].

* Write a scholarly article about &quot;Empirical studies in social epistemology&quot; and get it published.

* Write to authors of good books on subjects we need help on and invite them to write an article on Wikipedia. 

* Schools. Speak to any teachers you know and have them set up an exercise where their students write on various topics that are untouched. Students get school credit for their work, obviously and also get excited about participating. I've told my mother (who teaches grade 4), and her students are planning to do articles about australian mammals, some as-yet-untouched countries, etc.

* Promote free content: Whenever you make a post on other content sites, include a statement that your content is GFDL, public domain, or whatever...

* Get slashdotted once in a while.  For example submit article to Slashdot when we reach 150,000 articles, 200,000, etc...  [[User:Dgrant|dave]] 15:48 18 Jul 2003 (UTC)

* Add an [[RSS (protocol)|RSS]] feed to syndicate the content. See [[meta:RDF spool]]

* Would it be possible to make a subscription to an &quot;Article of the Day&quot; email. So someone subscribes and then every day they get a different entry in their mailbox. This is something that websters.com and dictionary.com do for &quot;word of the day&quot; definitions. It would probably need someone to take charge of it and select which entries go out (the random link too often goes to a stub or a disabmiguation page) I'll ([[user:MrWeeble]]) volunteer. It shouldn't be too hard to do - there's plenty of free (as in speech as well as in beer) software for this kind of thing 

*Just tell people about Wikipedia- like one-on-one

* Suggest publications that came with CD or DVD to include converted static dump of Wikipedia (including viewer applications, if required) in their CD or DVD. Even better, suggest them to write an article about Wikipedia too.

(The above is just a start!  Please add to the list!)

== Wikipedia Evangelism ==
Hi, I've mentioned this before and thought I'd mention it again. As I'm browsing the pedia I find articles that might interest friends/coworkers. I pop them a link in a quick hello message and ask them if they confirm the accuracy of the content...the response so far has been first one of wonder, then awe, then enthusiasm! And it's been a nice way to relate to some folks I'm not often in contact with. Anyway, I searched for [[evangelism]] and came up with nada around the 'pedia. Is there a place for sharing an evangelical/ 'help us' message of [[wikipedia]]? --[[User:DennisDaniels|dgd]]

There's some stuff at [[Wikipedia:Building Wikipedia membership]]. (Hint which wouldn't help here but may in general: after searching, go to the &quot;Power search&quot; box at the bottom of the screen and check the box for the 'Wikipedia' namespace. You'll get various about, help, documentation, etc pages that aren't supposed to show up when you're searching for encyclopedia articles.) Also check the [[m:Main Page|Meta-wikipedia]] where we keep general project discussion and misc stuff. --[[User:Brion VIBBER|Brion]] 20:42 Oct 22, 2002 (UTC)

How about doing what a lot of news web pages do?  They have a box at the bottom, &quot;Send this article to a friend&quot; with some kind of java mailer to ship it off and a box for you to add a signed message. [[User:Ortolan88|Ortolan88]]
:I like that idea too. Especially, and I know this would require more overhead, but a way to keep my list of folks in memory so I don't have to open my email client (which may not be available esp, as I'm a student and working on diff. machines).
:How about mailto:root@localhost?Subject=Main%20Page&amp;Body=Look%20at%20http%3A//www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page] ? The text needs to be changed, but it takes no more work than the Edit this page link to add at the bottom. Use a form with input text or a [[JavaScript]] inputbox() to an e-mail, then add subject=&lt;title&gt;&amp;body=Look%20at%20&lt;url-to-title&gt; to the mailto. [[User:Geoffrey|Geoffrey]] 23:27 Mar 21, 2003 (UTC)

* Add Wikipedia pages to ODP and Yahoo directories
* Add Wikipedia to your Yahoo profile's favorite sites
[[User:Hemanshu|Hemanshu]] 22:48, 24 Nov 2003 (UTC)

* Develop software like Google toolbar to reach Wikipedia articles and browse Wikipedia [[User:Hemanshu|Hemanshu]] 23:31, 24 Nov 2003 (UTC)

Wikimedia should run a Wikipedia advertisement competition. As far as I can tell, WikiPedia has no advertisements. I am on a college campus and one group I am associated with advertises for lots of free software (Firefox and OpenOffice mostly) that is useful to college students. We would definitely put up some Wikipedia posters if there were a couple simple advertisements we could print out. This should be done similarly to how the logo contests were. If the contests are run, the purpose should be to get at least four advertisements: fliers for letter/A4 paper in both black &amp; white and color and posters for tabloid/A3 paper in both black &amp; white and color, so that it is easy for people to print them off and put them up on bulletin boards and the like. (If advertisements are available and I cannot find them, they should be made much more obvious.) --[[User:Jamethknorth|Jamethknorth]] 02:25, 20 Mar 2005 (UTC)

==Invitation Letter==
Last weekend, I went to a number of places where there were guided tours, and that got me thinking...''it would be nice if this person could contribute their knowledge of this place to Wikipedia...''

I think there should be a standard letter to invite people to share their knowledge with Wikipedia, for when you come across someone who knows a lot about something.

Or does a simlar thing already exist?  What do you think?  [[User:RealGrouchy|RealGrouchy]] 00:03, 9 Jun 2004 (UTC)

: I think it's a great idea. There's some sample solicitation letters linked from [[Wikipedia:Building Wikipedia membership]]. [[User:Matt Crypto|&amp;mdash; Matt]] 02:02, 9 Jun 2004 (UTC)
 
Okay, so obviously I checked it out.  Can someone draft a copy that can be printed out and handed to people (maybe like two to a page?).  If nobody does, then I'll probably make one in time.  [[User:RealGrouchy|RealGrouchy]] 17:39, 9 Jun 2004 (UTC)

==Don't lose new and existing members!==

There are a lot of great ideas for bringing in new members here. But don't forget that, once they're here, we want to keep them! [[America Online]] is a great case study of how focusing too much on new members and not enough on serving existing members can actually ''lose'' overall membership. Wikipedia must be an useful, easy, and pleasurable experience for new users. The droves of contributors ensure that &quot;useful&quot; is not a problem, at least as far as content goes. To make it &quot;easy&quot;, more attention needs to be paid the initial interface learning curve for newbies. Both &quot;pleasurable&quot; and &quot;useful&quot; are significantly impacted by outrageously long response times and frequent server down time, so we must be careful not to bring in new people faster than we can fix these ongoing problems. Give a person a bad taste in their mouth from their first experience with Wikipedia, and we may not see them again. (That's why I never went back to Ask Jeeves!, Encylopedia Britannica, and many other search and reference sites after finding more reliable ones.) -- [[User:Jeffq|Jeff Q]] 17:55, 9 Jun 2004 (UTC)

:I know what you mean.  I still consider myself a 'new member', but I spend a lot of time just looking through the hordes of confusing help pages before I made my first edit (I have never used the sandbox).  Luckily, I added an entry to my user page telling people that I am a new user, and asking for suggestions, and someone told me what they felt was the most important tips and links.

: Now, I do things with more ease, because I can look at pages I've created (esp images) and see how others have edited my work, and I can adapt to that format in new pages.  However, I'm a follow-the-instructions kind of guy; we should have procedural stuff to tell people what they need to know about different things, like editing a page, and adding an image, etc. [[Wikipedia:Picture tutorial]] is a good example. - [[User:RealGrouchy|RealGrouchy]] 23:14, 9 Jun 2004 (UTC)

::I think Wikipedia does a pretty good job of explaining all the pieces that one needs to do various things. The problem is perhaps more the sheer size and quantity of things one should learn to feel truly Wiki-knowledgeable. I'm always coming across useful pages by accident. I just ran into [[Wikipedia:Style and How-to Directory]], some items of which I've read before, and some I've picked up by Wiki-osmosis, but I suspect this will give me another boost along the learning curve. I have two tips about the Sandbox I hadn't noticed mentioned anywhere:
::# Most of the time, what you're testing is completely demonstrated in &quot;Show preview&quot;, so you don't even need to worry about overwriting the main Sandbox &amp;mdash; just keep your Edit window open until you're done, then Cancel or just close it.
::# I ran across another Wikipedian (I forgot who) who had created their own Sandbox at User:&lt;username&gt;/Sandbox. It's easy to create such a page, and you never have to worry about what's in the main Sandbox or that someone might overwrite it, plus you can save stuff for extended testing.
::I'll bet there are similar &quot;best practices&quot; tips scattered around, maybe even not so scattered. It's hard to know with some much to learn and find. But that's a Good Thing, mostly. -- [[User:Jeffq|Jeff Q]] 00:05, 10 Jun 2004 (UTC)

:There is a real need to make inforamtion about the project, especially help pages more ordered and useful. To give an example although I can find many pages which tell me that I can have a personal Sandbox there is no documentation on how to achieve this. There isn't even a forum where newbies can post a question and get an answer to their problem/request from someone more experienced, or if it exists it is not well publicised.--[[User:ChemRad|ChemRad]] 13:56, 24 Feb 2005 (UTC)

==From Wikipedia:Publicity==
There are numerous ways you can help publicize [[Wikipedia]], and thereby get more people to edit your work and make this into a real live encyclopedia.  Just think--in a few years, Wikipedia is probably going to be ''amazing.''  (Feel free to add to this list.)

* Ask people to read and help:
** If you've done a lot of work in some particular area, post an announcement to a mailing list or newsgroup telling people about your work and asking them to help.
** If there hasn't been a lot of work in a particular area, post an announcement telling people about Wikipedia and asking them to help!
** Tell friends and colleagues.  E-mail an announcement to them.  Ask them to check your work, or to write pages on their areas of specialization, or their hobbies, or whatever.

* Publicize wiki pages:
** Submit particular wiki pages (e.g., your &quot;baby&quot; pages) to search engines.
** Link to Wikipedia from your websites. Linking to articles helps people find them and improves their ranking on search engines.
** Ask other people to link to Wikipedia.

* Publicize Wikipedia as a whole: 
** Observe (in writing and smugly) on other wikis that Wikipedia is easily the fastest-growing wiki in the world.
** Add a link to Wikipedia to your e-mail or message board signature.
** Share your joy of using Wikipedia with your friends and other people.

==From Wikipedia talk:Publicity==
=== Hard to find help on how to publicise the Wikipedia ===

* [[Wikipedia:Banners and buttons]]
* [[Wikipedia:Building Wikipedia membership]]

But nowhwere from the Main pages or the &quot;Community Portal&quot; is this or an alternative page listed!

==Targeting publicity efforts==

Wikipedia is now one of the top 30 web sites on the net, period.  It seems that anyone in the developed world who hasn't heard about us yet soon will, either through word of mouth or the inevitable media coverage for such an important site.  Wikipedia is also currently dominating Google and other search engines, so there's really no need to solicit links anymore.  At this point, I think publicity efforts would be more useful if they were targeted.  For example we would like to recruit:
* Experts for fields where articles are languishing
* Translators
* Editors from cultural minorities not well represented here
* English-speaking residents of non-English-speaking countries

The amount of publicity that Wikipedia gets from media outlets is very large.  Even if we could muster enough posters and volunteers to distribute them to compete with sheer volume, we have little direct control over what the media will say about us (though Jimbo has been doing a good job acting as a spokesperson, at least for those outlets who ask us for our point of view).  The best way I think we can make sure that the large amounts of free publicity we are getting is ''good'' publicity, is to improve what it is people see when they visit the site.  Given that most criticism recently has been about accuracy and trust and the site claiming to be more than it's not (since people assume an &quot;encyclopedia&quot; is professionally reviewed), an excellent first step would be to make sure anything that's in an unacceptable state is clearly marked, even if we can't fix it right away.

:Good points. I'm doing something like this - I have started [[Wikipedia:WikiProject International development|WikiProject International development]] and: 
:*have tried to make it useful for people new to Wikipedia
:*have provided &quot;Jumping off points&quot; so that task-oriented people can get right into editing
:*am now starting to contact organizations (e.g. [[:Category:Appropriate technology organizations|these ones]]):
:**to let them know about the resource
:**to ask them to put it in their newsletters
:**to let them know that it is easy to edit Wikipedia, that if they do want to share their expertise, that would be great
:**to let them know that if they don't want to get into editing, they are still very welcome to post suggestions or feedback on the [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject International development|Wikiproject talk page]]
:**to suggest that reading and working on articles in Wikipedia is a great way for students to learn, and a great way for development volunteers to prepare for a placement
:*we can contact relevant experts to ask for suggestions on resources and feedback on articles (at the same time ensuring that they know about Wikipedia's articles in their topic area)
:*we can post a brief notice on development-oriented discussion lists
:*I have added a section on translating to the [[Wikipedia:WikiProject International development|project page]] - and as I travel in Asia I will be on the lookout for keen people to help (partly through my contact with local [[NGO]]'s and development professionals).  -- [[User:Singkong2005|Singkong2005]] 04:26, 4 April 2006 (UTC)

Hello!  I would like to exchange links with you, if that's possible.  Wikipedia and Nupedia are free, open content encyclopedias.  Wikipedia now has about 10,000 articles, including many in the life sciences, and Nupedia's (peer reviewed) biology category is its most active.

Wikipedia would be happy to include a link to the Encyclopedia of Life Sciences on our &quot;Friends of Wikipedia&quot; page.  Wikipedia now receives something like 2,000 unique visitors a day, and we started in January; this e-mail is part of a drive to increase traffic, and so we expect traffic will increase greatly, particularly as we are growing by over 1,000 articles per month.

(These articles, both Wikipedia's and Nupedia's, are, by the way, free for you to use as you wish, with no fee--see our open content license.)

Best regards,

Larry Sanger

I am only now starting to publicize Wikipedia, a wiki-based free (open
content) encyclopedia project.  We started last January and already have
about 10,000 articles.  Perhaps you have seen us by now--we're located at
http://www.wikipedia.com . I'm the person responsible for organizing and
leading Wikipedia, as well as Nupedia (which has been moving *much* more
slowly).

First things first: it would be fantastic if you would like to link to any
or all of our articles.  They're free, of course.  I'd like to make this
as easy as possible for you, if you're interested.

If you have any free articles we can use, I would like to know about it!

More interestingly, perhaps, for you, is the idea that you can actually
use our content as part of your website.  It's free.  The cream of the
crop can be found at http://www.wikipedia.com/wiki.cgi?Brilliant_prose ,
but there's a *lot* more than that.  Also, the quality of Nupedia articles
is guaranteed; see http://www.nupedia.com/newest.phtml .  (There just
isn't much there yet.)

One thing we're working on is a program that will make it extremely easy
to mirror Wikipedia's content.  We're not done with that yet--but is that
something you might be interested in?

I certainly would like to hear back from you about how we might be able to
support each other.  I do not regard your website as a competitor in any
sense at all.

# Response to [http://slashdot.org/articles/01/10/10/1454231.shtml], an article critical of MIT's project and name from the perspective of GNU-style &quot;freedom&quot;, free speech versus free beer and all that good stuff.
# Article discussing the meaning and possibility of unbiased writing, using Wikipedia as an example.  A number of websites might be interested in this, including Kuro5hin.
# &quot;How is Wikipedia possible?&quot;
# &quot;Why should anybody trust what is in Wikipedia?&quot;  An interesting study in applied social epistemology: for many Wikipedia articles, we have ''zero'' information about the credentials of the people who wrote the article.  Should we give the article zero credence?  No.  Why not?  Might be good for an e-zine about computers and philosophy...I think there is one.
# The history of free online encyclopedia projects
# Why an encyclopedia?  Why not just use Google?
# Done: Kuro5hin article reporting: RMS endorsement; 10,000 articles; NYT coverage; Tech Review coverage.  ([[User:LMS|LMS]] plans to write this as soon as gnu.org puts up a link to Wikipedia.)
# submit wikipedia articles on controversial issues to discussion sites to show off our neutral point of view (maybe a stupid idea)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hey, we can probably get a ''lot'' of traffic from About.com.  The way About.com works is this: they have a bunch of people working independently building guides to the Internet.  They don't have to make their guides consistent with each other.  They don't know if other guides are or are not accepting links from Wikipedia.  In short, in principle, we could get ''huge'' numbers of links from different pages on their website.  They'll love us because we're content-rich, and they like that.

So, if you feel so inspired, please go to [http://search.about.com/fullsearch.htm?terms=encyclopedia&amp;PM=59_0100_S] or for that matter, any page about any subject, and ask for links either to http://www.wikipedia.com/ or to the relevant part of Wikipedia.  They've got a ''huge'' (no kidding--''huge'') number of pages on about.com that link to encyclopedias.  Wikipedia should be linked from every one of them, but for that we've got to start asking!  :-)

But if you do this, could you please indicate, below, what guide/area you've solicited?  Thanks.

I'm the main organizer of Wikipedia, a free, open content encyclopedia.
Please have a look, at http://www.wikipedia.com/ . I would be delighted if
you would link to it from

http://kidspenpals.about.com/cs/dictionaries/

We've got 10,000 articles, growing by 2,000 per month. It's pretty
amazing, really. Here is an article about it in the MIT Technology Review:

http://www.techreview.com/web/heim/heim090401.asp

We're also soon going to be the subject of an article in the New York
Times.

Thanks!

[[File:WA Police Booze Bus.jpg|thumb|[[Police bus]] in [[Australia]]]]
A '''bus''' (archaically also '''omnibus''', '''multibus''', or '''autobus''') is a [[road vehicle]] designed to carry [[passenger]]s. Buses can have a capacity as high as 300 passengers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jongo News&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.jongo.com/articles/07/0315/9180/OTE4MAmXAYhbF0.html|title=China's longest bus unveiled in Shanghai|first=|last=|publisher=Jongo.com|date=15 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common type of bus is the [[single-decker bus]], with larger loads carried by [[double-decker bus]]es and [[articulated bus]]es, and smaller loads carried by [[midibus]]es and [[minibus]]es; [[coach (vehicle)|coaches]] are used for longer distance services. [[Bus manufacturing]] is increasingly [[globalisation|globalised]], with the same design appearing around the world.

Buses may be used for [[Public transport bus service|scheduled bus transport]], [[Coach (scheduled transport)|scheduled coach transport]], [[school transport]], private hire, [[Tour bus|tourism]]; promotional buses may be used for [[political campaign]]s and others are privately operated for a wide range of purposes.

[[Horse-drawn vehicle|Horse drawn buses]] were used from 1820, followed by [[steam bus]]es in the 1830 and electric [[trolleybus]]es in 1882. The first buses powered by [[internal combustion engine]]s were used 1895{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} and this is still the most common power source. Recently there has been growing interest in [[hybrid electric bus]]es, [[fuel cell bus]]es, [[electric bus]]es as well as ones powered by [[compressed natural gas]] or [[bio-diesel]].

== Etymology ==
'''Bus''' is an [[Apheresis (linguistics)|apheresis]] of the Latin word '''Omnibus'''. It is derived from the hatter Omnès' shop named &quot;Omnes Omnibus&quot; which was situated in front of one of the first bus station in [[Nantes]] in 1825. &quot;Omnes Omnibus&quot; was a pun on the Latin sounding name of the hatter : '''omnes''' meaning &quot;all&quot; and '''omnibus''' means &quot;for all&quot; in [[Latin]]. Nantes citizen soon gave the nickname of Omnibus to the vehicle.&lt;ref name=&quot;amtuir&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.amtuir.org/03_htu_generale/htu_1_avant_1870/htu_1.htm |title=Histoire générale des transports |author= |date= |work= |publisher=French transportations Museum Website  |accessdate=16 September 2010}} {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; When motorized transport replaced horse-drawn transport starting 1905, a motorized omnibus was called an '''''autobus''''', a term still used.

It is pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ʌ|s}} or, in some dialects (especially [[Northern England]]) {{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ʊ|s}}, plural either &quot;buses&quot; or &quot;busses&quot;, both pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ʌ|s|ɨ|z}}.

== Types ==
Formats include [[single-decker bus]], [[double-decker bus]] and [[articulated bus]] (or 'bendy-bus') the prevalence of which varies from country to country. [[bi-articulated bus]]es are also manufactured, and passenger-carrying trailers&amp;mdash; either towed behind a conventional bus (a [[Trailer (vehicle)|bus trailer]]), or hauled as a trailer by a [[truck]] (a [[trailer bus]]). Smaller [[midibus]] have a lower capacity and [[open-top bus]] are typically used for leisure purposes. In many new fleets, particularly in local transit systems, there is an increasing shift to [[low-floor bus]]es primarily for easier accessibility. [[Coach (vehicle)|Coaches]] are designed for longer-distance travel and are typically fitted with individual high-backed reclining seats, seat-belts, toilets, [[audio-visual]] entertainment systems and can operate at higher speeds with more capacity for luggage. Coaches may be single- or double-deckers, articulated and often include a separate luggage compartment under the passenger floor. [[Guided bus]]es are fitted with technology to allow them to run in designated guideways, allowing the controlled alignment at [[bus stop]]s and less space taken up by guided lanes than conventional roads or [[bus lane]]s.

[[Bus manufacturing]] may be by a single company (an integral manufacturer), or by one manufacturer's building a bus body over a chassis produced by another manufacturer.

==Design==
=== Accessibility ===
[[File:Praha, DOD 2006 Hostivař, Plošina autobusu Karosa pro invalidy.JPG|thumb|Bus with [[wheelchair lift]] extended]]
[[Transit bus]]es increasingly use [[low-floor bus]] designs and optionally also 'kneeling' [[air suspension]] and electrically or hydraulically extended under-floor ramps to provide level access for [[wheelchair]] users and people with [[baby transport|baby carriages]]. Prior to more general use of such technology these wheelchair users could only use specialist [[paratransit]] mobility buses.

Accessible vehicles also have wider entrances and interior gangways and space for [[wheelchair]]s. Interior fittings and [[rollsign|destination displays]] may also be designed to be usable by the [[visually impaired]]. Coaches generally use [[wheelchair lift]]s instead of low floor designs. In some countries vehicles are required to have these features by [[Disability discrimination act|disability discrimination laws]].

===Configuration===
Buses were initially configured with an engine in the front and an entrance at the rear. With the transition to one-man operation, many manufacturers moved to mid or rear-engined designs, with a single door at the front, or multiple doors. The move to the low-floor design has all but eliminated the mid-engined design, although some coaches still have mid mounted engines. Front-engined buses still persist for niche markets such as American school buses, some minibuses, and buses in less developed countries, which may be derived from truck chassis, rather than purpose-built bus designs. Most buses have two [[axles]], articulated buses have three.

===Guidance===
[[Guided bus]]es are fitted with technology to allow them to run in designated guideways, allowing the controlled alignment at [[bus stop]]s and less space taken up by guided lanes than conventional roads or [[bus lane]]s. Guidance can be mechanical, optical or electromagnetic. Guidance is often, but not exclusively, employed as part of a BRT scheme. Extensions of the guided technology include the [[Bombardier Guided Light Transit|Guided Light Transit]] and [[Translohr]] systems, although these are more often termed 'rubber tyred trams' as they have limited or no mobility away from their guideways.

=== Liveries ===
[[Transit bus]]es are normally painted to identify the operator or a route, function or to demarcate low-cost or premium service buses. Bus may be [[paint]]ed onto the vehicle, applied using adhesive [[vinyl]] technologies or using [[decal]]s. Vehicles often also carry [[bus advertising]] or part or all of their visible surfaces (as [[mobile billboard]]). [[campaign bus]]es may be decorated with key campaign messages.

=== Propulsion ===
[[File:Ride On 5312 at Glenmont.jpg|thumb|[[Ride On (bus)|Ride On]] [[hybrid electric bus]] with appropriate livery]]
The most common power source since the 1920s has been the [[diesel engine]]. Early buses, known as [[trolleybus]], were powered by [[electricity]] supplied from [[overhead lines]]. Nowadays, electric buses often carry their own battery, which is sometimes [[Phileas (public transport)|recharged on stops/stations in order to keep the size of the battery small/lightweight]]. Currently there is interest in [[hybrid electric bus]]es, [[fuel cell bus]]es, [[electric bus]]es and ones powered by [[compressed natural gas]] or [[bio-diesel]]. [[Gyrobus]]es, which are powered by the momentum stored by a [[flywheel]] were tried in the 1940s.

== Manufacture ==
{{Main|Bus manufacturing}}
Early [[bus manufacturing]] grew out of [[carriage]] [[coachbuilding]], and later out of automobile or truck manufacturers. Early buses were merely a bus body fitted to a truck chassis. This body+chassis approach has continued with modern specialist manufacturers, although there also exist integral designs such as the [[Leyland National]] where the two are practically inseparable. Specialist builders also exist and concentrate on building buses for special uses, or modifying standard buses into specialised products.

Integral designs have the advantages that they are have been well tested for strength, stability and so forth, and also are [[Commercial off-the-shelf|off-the-shelf]]. But there are, however, two incentives to use the chassis+body model. First it allows the buyer and manufacturer both to shop for the best deal for their needs, rather than having to settle on one fixed design&amp;mdash; the buyer can choose the body and the chassis separately. Second it is likely that over the lifetime of a vehicle (in constant service and heavy traffic) that it will get minor damage now and again, and to be able easily to replace a body panel or window etc. can vastly increase its [[service life]] and save the cost and inconvenience of removing it from service.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

As with the rest of the [[automotive industry]], into the 20th century bus manufacturing increasingly became globalized, with manufacturers producing buses far from their intended market to exploit labour and material cost advantages. As with the cars, new models are often exhibited by manufacturers at prestigious industry shows to gain new orders.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

=== Public transport ===
{{Main|Public transport bus service}}
[[Transit bus]], used on [[public transport bus service]]s, have utilitarian fittings designed for efficient movement of large numbers of people, and often have multiple doors. [[coach (vehicle)|coach]]es are used for longer distance routes. High capacity [[bus rapid transit]] services may use the bi-articulated bus or [[tram]] style buses such as [[Wright StreetCar]] and the [[Irisbus]] Civis.

Buses and coach services often operate to a pre-determined published [[public transport timetable]] defining the route and the timing, however smaller vehicles may be used on more flexible [[demand responsive transport]] services.

=== Tourism ===
Buses play a major part in the [[tourism]] industry. [[Tour bus]]es around the world allow tourists to view local attractions or scenery. These are often [[open-top bus]]es, but can also be by regular bus or [[coach (vehicle)|coach]].

In local [[sightseeing]], [[City Sightseeing]] is the largest operator of local tour buses, operating on a franchised basis all over the world. Specialist tour buses are also often owned and operated by [[safari park]]s and other [[Amusement park|theme parks or resorts]]. Longer distance tours are also carried out by bus, either on a turn up and go basis or through a [[tour operator]], and usually allow disembarkation from the bus to allow touring of sites of interest on foot. These may be day trips or longer [[excursion]]s incorporating hotel stays. Tour buses will often carry a [[tour guide]], although the driver or a pre-recorded [[audio commentary]] may also perform this function. The tour operator may itself be a subsidiary of a bus operating company that operates buses and coaches for other uses, or an independent company that charters buses or coaches. [[Commuter]] transport operators may also use their coaches to conduct tours within the target city between the morning and evening commuter transport journey.

Buses and coaches are also a common component of the wider [[package holiday]] industry, providing private airport transfers (in addition to general [[airport bus]]es) and organised tours and day trips for holidaymakers on the package.

Public long distance coach networks are also often used as a low-cost method of travel by [[student]]s or young people travelling the world. Some companies such as [[Topdeck Travel]] were set up to specifically use buses to drive the [[hippie trail]] or travel to places like north [[Africa]].

In many tourist or travel destinations, a bus is part of the [[tourist attraction]], such as the North American [[tourist trolley]]s, London’s [[Routemaster]] [[London Buses heritage routes (disambiguation)|heritage route]]s, or the [[customised buses]] of Malta, Asia and the Americas.

[[File:First Student IC school bus 202076.jpg|thumb|left|U.S. style [[school bus]]]]

=== Student transport ===
{{Main|Student transport}}
In some countries, particularly the [[USA]] and [[Canada]], buses used to transport [[school]] [[child]]ren have evolved in to a specific design with specified mandatory features. These [[school bus]]es feature things such as the [[school bus yellow]] livery and [[School bus crossing arm|crossing guards]]. Other countries may mandate the use of [[seat belts]]. As a minimum many countries require that a bus carrying students displays a [[:Commons:Category:School bus signs|sign]], and may also adopt yellow liveries. Student transport often uses older buses cascaded from service use, retro-fitted with more seats and/or [[seatbelt]]s. Student transport may be operated by local authorities or private contractors. Schools may also own and operate their own buses for other transport needs, such as class [[field trip]]s, or to transport associated sports, music or other school groups.

=== Private charter ===
Due to the costs involved in owning, operating and driving buses and coaches, many bus and coach uses a [[private hire]] of vehicles from [[charter]] bus companies, either for a day or two, or a longer [[contract]] basis, where the charter company provides the vehicles and qualified drivers. Charter bus operators may be completely independent businesses, or charter hire may be a subsidiary business of a public transport operator who might maintain a separate fleet or use surplus buses, coaches, and dual purpose coach seated buses. Many private [[taxicab]] companies also operate larger [[minibus]] vehicles to cater for group fares. Companies, private groups and social clubs may hire buses or coaches as a cost effective method of transporting a group to an event or site, such as a group meeting, [[racing]] event, or organised recreational activity such as a [[summer camp]]. Entertainment or event companies may also hire temporary shuttles buses for transport at events such as [[festival]]s or [[academic conference|conference]]s. [[Party bus]]es are used by companies in a similar manner to [[limousine]] hire, for luxury private transport to social events or as a touring experience. [[Sleeper bus]]es are used by [[band (music)|bands]] or other organisations that tour between entertainment venues and require mobile rest and recreation facilities. Some couples hire preserved buses for their [[wedding transport]] instead of the traditional car. Buses are often hired for [[parade]]s or [[procession]]s. [[Victory parade]]s are often held for triumphant sports teams, who often tour their home town or city in an [[open-top bus]]. Sports teams may also contract out their transport to a [[team bus]], for travel to [[Road (sports)|away games]], to a [[Sports competition|competition]] or to a [[Final (competition)|final event]]. These buses are often specially decorated in a livery matching the team colours. Private companies often contract out private shuttle bus services, for transport of their customers or patrons, such as [[hotel]]s, [[amusement park]]s, [[university campus]]es or [[airport bus|private airport transfer]] services. This shuttle usage can be as transport between locations, or to and from [[parking lot]]s. High specification luxury coaches are often chartered by companies for [[Executive officer|executive]] or [[Very Important Person|VIP]] transport. Charter buses may also be used in Tourism and for promotion (See Tourism and Promotion sections)

=== Private ownership ===
Many organisations, including the police, [[not for profit]], social or charitable groups with a regular need for group transport may find it practical or cost-effective to own and operate a bus for their own needs. These are often [[minibus]]es for practical, tax and driver licensing reasons, although they can also be full size buses. [[Cadet]] or [[Scouting|scout]] groups or other youth organizations may also own buses. Specific [[Charitable organization|charities]] may exist to fund and operate bus transport, usually using specially modified mobility buses or otherwise accessible buses (See Accessibility section). Some use their contributions to buy vehicles, and provide volunteer drivers.

[[Airport]] operators make use of special airside [[airport bus]]es for crew and passenger transport in the secure [[Airside (airport)|airside]] parts of an airport. Some public authorities, police forces and military forces make use of [[armoured bus]]es where there is a special need to provide increased passenger protection. [[Police department]]s make use of [[police bus]]es for a variety of reasons, such as [[Prisoner transport vehicle|prisoner transport]], [[police officer|officer]] transport, temporary detention facilities and as [[command post|command and control vehicles]]. Some [[fire department]]s also use a converted bus as a command post,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cityofchesapeake.net/services/depart/fire/bus.shtml |title=Chesapeake Fire Department |publisher=Cityofchesapeake.net |date=1998-05-01 |accessdate=2010-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; while those in cold climates might retain a bus as a heated shelter at fire scenes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=City of Winnipeg Corporate Web Services |url=http://www.winnipeg.ca/fps/Services/Operations/MIRV.stm |title=Winnipeg Fire Department |publisher=Winnipeg.ca |date= |accessdate=2010-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many are drawn from retired school or service buses.

=== Promotion ===
Buses are often used for [[advertising]], [[political campaign]]ing, [[:Category:Public service announcements|public information campaigns]], [[public relation]]s or [[Promotion (marketing)|promotional]] purposes. These may take the form of temporary charter hire of service buses, or the temporary or permanent conversion and operation of buses, usually of [[Used good|second-hand]] buses. Extreme examples include converting the bus with displays and decorations or [[awning]]s and fittings. Interiors may be fitted out for exhibition or information purposes with special equipment and/or [[audio visual]] devices.

[[Bus advertising]] takes many forms, often as interior and exterior adverts and all-over advertising liveries. The practice often extends into the exclusive private hire and use of a bus to promote a brand or product, appearing at large public events, or touring busy streets. The bus is sometimes staffed by promotions personnel, giving out free gifts. [[Campaign bus]]es are often specially decorated for a [[political campaign]] or other social awareness information campaign, designed to bring a specific message to different areas, and/or used to transport campaign personnel to local areas/meetings. Exhibition buses are often sent to public events such as [[fair]]s and [[festival]]s for purposes such as recruitment campaigns, for example by private companies or the [[armed force]]s. Complex [[urban planning]] proposals may be organised into a mobile exhibition bus for the purposes of public consultation.

== Buses around the world ==
[[File:Ryujinbus 62.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ryūjin, Wakayama|Ryujin]] bus, [[Japan]]]]
{{See also|Category:Bus transport by country}}
Historically, the types and features of buses have developed according to local needs. Buses were fitted with technology appropriate to the local climate or passenger needs, such as air conditioning in Asia, or [[Bicycle|cycle]] mounts on North American buses. The bus types in use around the world where there was little mass production were often sourced second hand from other countries, such as the [[Malta bus]], and buses in use in Africa. Other countries such as [[Cuba]] required novel solutions to import restrictions, with the creation of the “camellos” ([[camel]] bus), a specially manufactured [[trailer bus]].

After the Second World War, manufacturers in Europe and the Far East, such as [[Mercedes-Benz buses]] and [[Mitsubishi Fuso Truck and Bus Corporation|Mitsubishi Fuso]] expanded into other continents influencing the use of buses previously served by local types. Use of buses around the world has also been influenced by [[Colonialism|colonial]] associations or political alliances between countries. Several of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth nations]] followed the British lead and sourced buses from British manufacturers, leading to a prevalence of [[double-decker bus]]es. Several [[Eastern Bloc]] countries adopted [[trolleybus]] systems, and their manufacturers such as [[Trolza]] exported trolleybuses to other friendly states.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} In the 1930s Italy designed the world's only '''triple decker bus''' for the busy route between Rome and Tivoli that could carry eighty-eight passengers.  It was unique not only in being a triple decker but having a separate smoking compartment on the third level.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=7-EDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA286&amp;dq=popular+mechanics+1932+the+president+of+a+big&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=JIgVTcvHIM2AnQf50_3fDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true &quot;Three Decker Auto Bus Carries 88 Persons&quot;] ''Popular Mechanics, August 1932&lt;/ref&gt;

The buses to be found in countries around the world often reflect the quality of the local [[road]] network, with high floor resilient truck based designs prevalent in several less developed countries where buses are subject to tough operating conditions. Population density also has a major impact, where dense urbanisation such as in [[Japan]] and the far east has led to the adoption of high capacity long [[multi-axle bus]]es, often double-deckers, while South America and China are implementing large numbers of [[articulated bus]]es for [[bus rapid transit]] schemes.

=== Bus expositions ===
Euro Bus Expo is a [[Trade fair|trade show]], which is held bi-annually at the UK's [[National Exhibition Centre]] in [[Birmingham]]. As the official show of the [[Confederation of Passenger Transport]], the UK’s trade association for the bus, coach and light rail industry, the three day event offers visitors from Europe and beyond the chance to see and experience, at first hand, the very latest vehicles and product and service innovations right across the industry. The next show will be held in November 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurobusxpo.com |title=Euro Bus Expo : Welcome to the European coach &amp; bus industry exhibition |publisher=Eurobusxpo.com |date= |accessdate=2009-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Busworld Kortrijk is the leading bus trade fair in Europe is the Busworld in [[Kortrijk]] in [[Belgium]]. It is held bi-annually, last time October 2009 and next time October 2011.

== History ==
[[File:Viverolugobus.jpg|thumb|200px|Old bus, serving [[Viveiro]] and [[Lugo]] in [[Galicia]], [[Spain]].]]
The [[Public transport bus service|first known public bus line]] (though it was called &quot;Carriage&quot; at that time) was launched by [[Blaise Pascal]] in 1662. It was quite popular at first but became crippled after nobility restricted access to the service to high society members only and increased the ticket price. It ceased operation 15 years later,&lt;ref name=&quot;amtuir&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.herodote.net/histoire/evenement.php?jour=18260810 |title=Le temps de révolutions |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Herodote.net |accessdate=16 September 2010}} {{fr icon}}  Retrieved 13 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and no further such services are known until the 1820s. Early horse-drawn buses were a combination of a [[hackney carriage]] and a [[stagecoach]]. From the 1830s [[Steam bus|steam powered buses]] existed. In parallel to the development of the bus, was the invention of the electric [[trolleybus]], typically fed through [[trolley pole]]s by [[Overhead lines|overhead wires]], which actually preceded, and in many urban areas outnumbered, the conventional engine powered bus{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}.

The first internal combustion engine buses were developed along with the automobile. After the first engine powered bus of 1895{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}.

The [[Yellow Coach Manufacturing Company]] which rapidly became a major manufacturer of buses was founded in [[Chicago]] in 1923 by [[John D. Hertz]]. [[General Motors]] purchased a majority stake in 1925 and changed its name to the Yellow Truck &amp; Coach Manufacturing Company. They then purchased the balance of the shares in 1943 to form the [[GMC (Truck)|GM Truck &amp; Coach Division]].

Models expanded in the 20th century, leading to the widespread introduction of the contemporary recognizable form of full size buses from the 1950s.

The [[Montgomery Bus Boycott]] which opposed the city's policy of [[racial segregation]] on its [[public transit]] system started on 1 December 1955, when [[Rosa Parks]], an African American woman, was arrested for refusing to surrender her seat to a white person in [[Montgomery, Alabama]], USA. It ended on 20 December 1956 with a [[United States Supreme Court]] decision that the laws requiring segregated buses were [[Constitutionality|unconstitutional]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crmvet.org/tim/timhis55.htm#1955mbb|title=Montgomery Bus Boycott|work=Civil Rights Movement Veterans}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many historically significant figures of the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955–1968)|civil rights movement]] were involved in the boycott, including Reverend [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] and [[Ralph Abernathy]].

== Use of retired buses ==
[[File:GMBus.jpg|thumb|right|Retired [[General Motors|GM]] bus]]

Most public or private buses and coaches, once they have reached the end of their service with one or more operators, are sent to the [[wrecking yard]] for breaking up for [[scrap]] and [[spare part]]s. Some buses, while not economical to keep running as service buses, are often converted in some way for use by the operator, or another user, for purposes other than revenue earning transport. Much like old cars and trucks, buses often pass through a [[Car dealership|dealership]] where they can be bought for a price or at auction.

Bus operators will often find it economical to convert retired buses to use as permanent [[training bus]]es for driver training, rather than taking a regular service bus out of use. Some large operators have in the past also converted retired buses into tow bus vehicles, to act as [[tow truck]]s. With the outsourcing of maintenance staff and facilities, the increase in company [[health and safety]] regulations, and the increasing [[curb weight]]s of buses, many operators now contract their towing needs to a professional [[vehicle recovery]] company.

Many retired buses have been converted to static or mobile [[café]]s, often using historic buses as a [[tourist attraction]]. Food is also provided from a catering bus, in which a bus is converted into a mobile [[Canteen (place)|canteen]] and [[Coffee break|break room]]. These are commonly seen at external [[filming location]]s to feed the cast and crew, and at other large events to feed staff. Some organisations adapt and operate [[playbus]]es or learning buses to provide a [[playground]] or learning environments to children who might not have access to proper play areas. An ex-London [[Routemaster]] bus has been converted to a mobile theatre and [[Runway (fashion)|catwalk fashion show]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2008/aug/16/theatre.londonlistings1 Event preview: Fashion Bus On The Square, London] The Guardian, 16 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Some buses meet a destructive end by being entered in [[banger racing|banger races]] or at [[demolition derby]]s.

Many old retired buses have also been converted into mobile holiday homes and campers.

=== Bus preservation ===
Rather than being [[wikt:scrapped|scrapped]] or converted for other uses, sometimes retired buses are saved for preservation. This can be done by individuals, volunteer preservation groups or charitable trusts, museums, or sometimes by the operators themselves as part of a [[heritage fleet]]. These buses often need to undergo a degree of [[vehicle restoration]] to restore them to their original condition, and will have their livery and other details such as internal notices and [[rollsign]]s restored to be authentic to a specific time in the bus's actual history. Some buses that undergo preservation are rescued from a state of great disrepair, but others enter preservation with very little wrong with them. As with other historic vehicles, many preserved buses either in a working or static state form part of the collections of [[List of transport museums|transport museums]]. Working buses will often be exhibited at rallies and events, and they are also used as charter buses. While many preserved buses are quite old or even vintage, in some cases relatively new examples of a bus type can enter restoration. In-service examples are still in use by other operators. This often happens when a change in design or operating practice, such as the switch to one person operation or low floor technology, renders some buses redundant while still relatively new.

'''Bali''' is an [[Indonesia]]n [[island]] located in the westernmost end of the [[Lesser Sunda Islands]], lying between [[Java (island)|Java]] to the west and [[Lombok]] to the east. It is one of the country's 33 [[Provinces of Indonesia|provinces]] with the provincial capital at [[Denpasar]] towards the south of the island.

With a population recorded as 3,891,000 in 2010,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.citypopulation.de/Indonesia-MU.html&lt;/ref&gt; the island is home to most of Indonesia's small [[Hindu]] minority. In the 2000 census about 92.29% of Bali's population adhered to [[Hinduism_in_Indonesia#Hinduism_in_Bali|Balinese Hinduism]] while most of the remainder follow Islam. It is also the largest tourist destination in the country and is renowned for its highly developed arts, including traditional and modern dance, sculpture, painting, leather, [[metalworking]], and [[Balinese music|music]]. Bali, despite being a tourist haven for decades, has seen a surge in tourist numbers in recent years.

== History ==
{{main|History of Bali}}

Bali was inhabited by about 2000 BC by [[Austronesian peoples]] who migrated originally from [[Taiwan]] through [[Maritime Southeast Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (2003), pp. 5, 7; Hinzler (1995)&lt;/ref&gt; Culturally and linguistically, the Balinese are thus closely related to the peoples of the Indonesian archipelago, the Philippines, and Oceania.&lt;ref&gt;Hinzler (1995)&lt;/ref&gt; Stone tools dating from this time have been found near the village of Cekik in the island's west.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (2003), p. 12; Lonely Planet (1999), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ancient Bali, nine Hindu sects existed, namely Pasupata, Bhairawa, Siwa Shidanta, Waisnawa, Bodha, Brahma, Resi, Sora and Ganapatya. Each sect revered a specific deity as its personal Godhead.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/04/28/the-birthplace-balinese-hinduism.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Balinese culture was strongly influenced by Indian and Chinese, and particularly [[Hindu]] culture, beginning around the 1st century AD. The name ''Bali dwipa'' (&quot;Bali island&quot;) has been discovered from various inscriptions, including the Blanjong pillar inscription written by [[Sri Kesari Warmadewa]] in 914 AD and mentioning &quot;Walidwipa&quot;. It was during this time that the complex irrigation system ''[[Subak (irrigation)|subak]]'' was developed to grow rice. Some religious and cultural traditions still in existence today can be traced back to this period. The Hindu [[Majapahit Empire]] (1293–1520 AD) on eastern [[Java (island)|Java]] founded a Balinese [[colony]] in 1343. When the empire declined, there was an exodus of intellectuals, artists, priests, and musicians from Java to Bali in the 15th century.

The first [[European ethnic groups|European]] contact with Bali is thought to have been made in 1585 when a [[Portugal|Portuguese]] ship foundered off the [[Bukit Peninsula]] and left a few Portuguese in the service of [[Dewa Agung]].&lt;ref&gt;Willard A. Hanna (2004). Bali Chronicles. Periplus, Singapore. ISBN 0-7946-0272-X p.32&lt;/ref&gt; In 1597 the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] explorer [[Cornelis de Houtman]] arrived at Bali and, with the establishment of the [[Dutch East India Company]] in 1602, the stage was set for colonial control two and a half centuries later when Dutch control expanded across the Indonesian archipelago throughout the second half of the nineteenth century (see [[Dutch East Indies]]). Dutch political and economic control over Bali began in the 1840s on the island's north coast, when the Dutch pitted various distrustful Balinese realms against each other.&lt;ref name=&quot;ctpqur&quot;&gt;Vickers (1995)&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1890s, struggles between Balinese kingdoms in the island's south were exploited by the Dutch to increase their control.

The Dutch mounted large naval and ground assaults at the Sanur region in 1906 and were met by the thousands of members of the royal family and their followers who fought against the superior Dutch force in a suicidal ''[[puputan]]'' defensive assault rather than face the humiliation of surrender.&lt;ref name=&quot;ctpqur&quot; /&gt; Despite Dutch demands for surrender, an estimated 1,000 Balinese marched to their death against the invaders.&lt;ref&gt;Haer, p.38&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Dutch intervention in Bali (1908)]], a similar massacre occurred in the face of a Dutch assault in [[Klungkung]]. Afterwards the Dutch governors were able to exercise administrative control over the island, but local control over religion and culture generally remained intact. Dutch rule over Bali came later and was never as well established as in other parts of Indonesia such as Java and [[Maluku Islands|Maluku]].

In the 1930s, anthropologists [[Margaret Mead]] and [[Gregory Bateson]], and artists [[Miguel Covarrubias]] and [[Walter Spies]], and musicologist [[Colin McPhee]] created a western image of Bali as &quot;an enchanted land of aesthetes at peace with themselves and nature&quot;, and western tourism first developed on the island.&lt;ref&gt;Friend, Theodore &quot;Indonesian destinies&quot; Harvard University Press, 2003 ISBN 0-674-01137-6, 9780674011373 Length 628 pages P111&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Balinese dancers.jpg|thumb|upright|Balinese dancers show for tourists, [[Ubud]].]]

[[Imperial Japan]] occupied Bali during [[World War II]], during which time a Balinese military officer, [[I Gusti Ngurah Rai|Gusti Ngurah Rai]], formed a Balinese 'freedom army'. The lack of institutional changes from the time of Dutch rule however, and the harshness of war requisitions made Japanese rule little better than the Dutch one.&lt;ref&gt;Haer, p.39-40&lt;/ref&gt; Following Japan's Pacific surrender in August 1945, the Dutch promptly returned to Indonesia, including Bali, immediately to reinstate their pre-war colonial administration. This was resisted by the Balinese rebels now using Japanese weapons. On 20 November 1946, the [[Battle of Marga]] was fought in Tabanan in central Bali. Colonel I Gusti Ngurah Rai, by then 29 years old, finally rallied his forces in east Bali at Marga Rana, where they made a [[suicide attack]] on the heavily armed Dutch. The Balinese battalion was entirely wiped out, breaking the last thread of Balinese military resistance. In 1946 the Dutch constituted Bali as one of the 13 administrative districts of the newly proclaimed [[State of East Indonesia]], a rival state to the Republic of Indonesia which was proclaimed and headed by [[Sukarno]] and [[Mohammad Hatta|Hatta]]. Bali was included in the &quot;Republic of the United States of Indonesia&quot; when the Netherlands recognised Indonesian independence on 29 December 1949.

The 1963 eruption of [[Mount Agung]] killed thousands, created economic havoc and forced many displaced Balinese to be [[Transmigration program|''transmigrated'']] to other parts of Indonesia. Mirroring the widening of social divisions across Indonesia in the 1950s and early 1960s, Bali saw conflict between supporters of the traditional [[caste system]], and those rejecting these traditional values. Politically, this was represented by opposing supporters of the [[Indonesian Communist Party]] (PKI) and the [[Indonesian Nationalist Party]] (PNI), with tensions and ill-feeling further increased by the PKI's land reform programs.&lt;ref name=&quot;ctpqur&quot; /&gt; [[30 September Movement|An attempted coup]] in Jakarta was put down by forces led by General Suharto. The army became the dominant power as it instigated [[Indonesian killings of 1965–66|a violent anti-communist purge]], in which the army blamed the PKI for the coup. Most estimates suggest that at least 500,000 people were killed across Indonesia, with an estimated 80,000 killed in Bali, equivalent to 5% of the island's population.&lt;ref&gt;Friend (2003), p. 111; Ricklefs (1991), p. 289; Vickers (1995)&lt;/ref&gt; With no Islamic forces involved as in Java and Sumatra, upper-caste PNI landlords led the extermination of PKI members.&lt;ref&gt;Ricklefs, p. 289.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the 1965/66 upheavals, Suharto was able to manoeuvre Sukarno [[Transition to the New Order|out of the presidency]], and his [[New Order (Indonesia)|&quot;New Order&quot;]] government reestablished relations with western countries. The pre-War Bali as &quot;paradise&quot; was revived in a modern form, and the resulting large growth in tourism has led to a dramatic increase in Balinese standards of living and significant foreign exchange earned for the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;ctpqur&quot; /&gt; [[2002 Bali bombings|A bombing in 2002]] by militant [[Islamist]]s in the tourist area of [[Kuta]] killed 202 people, mostly foreigners. This attack, and [[2005 Bali bombings|another in 2005]], severely affected tourism, bringing much economic hardship to the island. Tourist numbers have now returned to levels before the bombings.

== Geography ==
{{See also|List of bodies of water in Bali|List of mountains in Bali}}
[[File:Bali Labeled.png|thumb|Topography of the island]]

The island of Bali lies 3.2&amp;nbsp;km (2&amp;nbsp;mi) east of [[Java (island)|Java]], and is approximately [[8th parallel south|8 degrees south]] of the [[equator]]. Bali and Java are separated by the [[Bali Strait]]. East to west, the island is approximately 153&amp;nbsp;km (95&amp;nbsp;mi) wide and spans approximately 112&amp;nbsp;km (69&amp;nbsp;mi) north to south; its land area is 5,632&amp;nbsp;km².

Bali's central mountains include several peaks over 3,000 metres in elevation. The highest is [[Mount Agung]] (3,142 m), known as the &quot;mother mountain&quot; which is an active [[volcano]]. Mountains range from centre to the eastern side, with Mount Agung the easternmost peak. Bali's volcanic nature has contributed to its exceptional fertility and its tall mountain ranges provide the high rainfall that supports the highly productive agriculture sector. South of the mountains is a broad steadily descending area where most of Bali's large rice crop is grown. The northern side of the mountains slopes more steeply to the sea and is the main coffee producing area of the island, along with rice, vegetables and cattle. The longest river, [[Ayung River]], flows approximately 75&amp;nbsp;km.

The island is surrounded by [[coral reefs]]. [[Beach]]es in the south tend to have white sand while those in the north and west have [[black sand]]. Bali has no major waterways, although the Ho River is navigable by small ''[[sampan]]'' boats. Black sand beaches between Pasut and Klatingdukuh are being developed for tourism, but apart from the seaside temple of [[Tanah Lot]], they are not yet used for significant tourism.

The largest city is the provincial capital, [[Denpasar]], near the southern coast. Its population is around 491,500(2002). Bali's second-largest city is the old colonial capital, [[Singaraja]], which is located on the north coast and is home to around 100,000 people. Other important cities include the beach resort, [[Kuta]], which is practically part of Denpasar's urban area; and [[Ubud]], which is north of Denpasar, and is known as the island's cultural centre.

Three small islands lie to the immediate south east and all are administratively part of the [[Klungkung]] regency of Bali: [[Nusa Penida]], [[Nusa Lembongan]] and [[Nusa Ceningan]]. These islands are separated from Bali by the Badung Strait.

To the east, the [[Lombok Strait]] separates Bali from [[Lombok]] and marks the [[Biogeography|biogeographical]] division between the fauna of the [[Indomalaya]]n [[ecozone]] and the distinctly different fauna of [[Australasia]]. The transition is known as the [[Wallace Line]], named after [[Alfred Russel Wallace]], who first proposed a transition zone between these two major [[biome]]s. When sea levels dropped during the [[quaternary glaciation|Pleistocene ice age]], Bali was connected to [[Java (island)|Java]] and [[Sumatra]] and to the mainland of Asia and shared the Asian fauna, but the deep water of the Lombok Strait continued to keep Lombok and the [[Lesser Sunda Islands|Lesser Sunda archipelago]] isolated.

== Ecology ==
[[File:Bali Mynah - Houston Zoo.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Bali Starling]] is found only on Bali and is critically endangered.]]

Bali lies just to the west of the [[Wallace Line]], and thus has a fauna which is Asian in character, with very little Australasian influence, and has more in common with Java than with Lombok.  An exception is the [[Yellow-crested Cockatoo]], a member of a primarily Australasian family. There are around 280 species of birds, including the critically endangered [[Bali Starling]], which is [[endemism|endemic]]. Others Include [[Barn Swallow]], [[Black-naped Oriole]], [[Black Racket-tailed Treepie]], [[Crested Serpent-eagle]], [[Crested Treeswift]], [[Dollarbird]], [[Java Sparrow]], [[Lesser Adjutant]], [[Long-tailed Shrike]], [[Milky Stork]], [[Pacific Swallow]], [[Red-rumped Swallow]], [[Sacred Kingfisher]], [[Sea eagle (bird)|Sea Eagle]], [[Woodswallow]], [[Savanna Nightjar]], [[Stork-billed Kingfisher]], [[Yellow-vented Bulbul]], [[White Heron]], [[Great Egret]].

Until the early 20th century, Bali was home to several large mammals: the wild [[Banteng]], [[Leopard]] and an endemic [[subspecies]] of Tiger, the [[Bali Tiger]]. The Banteng still occurs in its domestic form, while leopards are found only in neighboring Java, and the Bali Tiger is extinct. The last definite record of a Tiger on Bali dates from 1937, when one was shot, though the subspecies may have survived until the 1940s or 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;IUCN, [http://www.iucnredlist.org/apps/redlist/details/41682/0 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species] accessed 24 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The relatively small size of the island, conflict with humans, poaching and habitat reduction drove the Tiger to extinction. This was the smallest and rarest of all Tiger subspecies and was never caught on film or displayed in zoos, while few skins or bones remain in museums around the world. Today, the largest mammals are the [[Javan Rusa]] deer and the [[Wild Boar]].  A second, smaller species of deer, the [[Indian Muntjac]], also occurs.

[[File:Monkey Forest, Ubud 200507-1.jpg|thumb|Monkey Forest, [[Ubud]].]]

[[Squirrel]]s are quite commonly encountered, less often the [[Asian Palm Civet]], which is also kept in coffee farms to produce [[Kopi Luwak]]. [[Bat]]s are well represented, perhaps the most famous place to encounter them remaining the Goa Lawah (Temple of the Bats) where they are worshipped by the locals and also constitute a tourist attraction.  They also occur in other cave temples, for instance at Gangga Beach. Two species of [[Old World monkey|monkey]] occur.  The [[Crab-eating Macaque]], known locally as “kera”, is quite common around human settlements and temples, where it becomes accustomed to being fed by humans, particularly in any of the three “monkey forest” temples, such as the popular one in the [[Ubud]] area. They are also quite often kept as pets by locals. The second monkey, far rarer and more elusive is the [[Silvery Lutung|Silver Leaf Monkey]] known locally as “lutung”. They occur in few places apart from the [[Bali Barat National Park]]. Other, rarer mammals include the [[Leopard Cat]], [[Sunda Pangolin]] and [[Black Giant Squirrel]].

Snakes include the [[King Cobra]] and [[Reticulated Python]]. The [[Water Monitor]] can grow to an impressive size and move surprisingly quickly.

The rich coral reefs around the coast, particularly around popular diving spots such as [[Tulamben]], [[Amed (Bali)|Amed]], Menjangan or neighboring [[Nusa Penida]], host a wide range of marine life, for instance [[Hawksbill Turtle]], [[Mola mola|Giant Sunfish]], [[Manta ray|Giant Manta Ray]], [[Giant moray|Giant Moray Eel]], [[Bumphead Parrotfish]], [[Hammerhead Shark]], [[Grey reef shark|Reef Shark]], [[barracuda]], and [[sea snake]]s. [[Dolphin]]s are commonly encountered on the north coast near [[Singaraja]] and [[Lovina]].

Many plants have been introduced by humans within the last centuries, particularly since the 20th century, making it sometimes hard to distinguish what plants are really native. Among the larger trees the most common are: [[Banyan]] trees, [[Jackfruit]], [[coconut]]s, [[bamboo]] species, [[acacia]] trees and also endless rows of [[coconut]]s and [[banana]] species. Numerous flowers can be seen: [[hibiscus]], [[frangipani]], [[bougainvillea]], [[poinsettia]], [[oleander]], [[jasmine]], [[Nymphaeaceae|water lily]], [[Nelumbo|lotus]], [[rose]]s, [[begonia]]s, orchids and [[hydrangea]]s exist. On higher grounds that receive more moisture, for instance around [[Kintamani, Bali|Kintamani]], certain species of [[fern]] trees, [[mushroom]]s and even [[pine]] trees thrive well. Rice comes in many varieties. Other plants with agricultural value include: [[salak]], [[mangosteen]], [[Maize|corn]], Kintamani [[Orange (fruit)|orange]], [[coffee]] and [[water spinach]].

A team of scientists has conducted survey from April 29, 2011 to May 11, 2011 at 33 sea site of Bali. They have discovered 952 species of reef fish which 8 of them were new discoveries at [[Pemuteran]], [[Gilimanuk]], [[Nusa Dua]], [[Tulamben]] and [[Candidasa]] and 393 coral species, including two new ones at [[Padangbai]] and between Padangbai and [[Amed]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/05/13/new-fish-coral-species-found.html&lt;/ref&gt;
The average coverage level of healthy coral was 36 percent (better than in [[Raja Ampat]] and [[Halmahera]] by 29 percent or in [[Fakfak]] and [[Kaimana]] by 25 percent) with the highest coverage was found in [[Gili Selang]] and [[Gili Mimpang]] in [[Candidasa]], [[Karangasem]] regency.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/05/16/coral-reefs’-health-‘improves’.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environment==
Some of the worst erosion has occurred in [[Lebih Beach]], where up to 7 meters of land is lost every year. Decades ago, this beach was used for holy pilgrimages with more than 10,000 people, but they have now moved to [[Masceti Beach]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/05/05/once-was-a-beach.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Administrative divisions ==
The province is divided into 8 [[Regencies of Indonesia|regencies]] (''kabupaten'') and 1 [[Cities of Indonesia|city]] (''kota''). Unless otherwise stated, the regency's capital:

* [[Badung]], capital [[Mangupura]]
* [[Bangli Regency|Bangli]], capital [[Bangli]]
* [[Buleleng]], capital [[Singaraja]]
* [[Denpasar]] (city)
* [[Gianyar Regency|Gianyar]], capital [[Gianyar]]
* [[Jembrana]], capital Negara
* [[Karangasem]], capital [[Amlapura]]
* [[Klungkung]], capital [[Semarapura]]
* [[Tabanan Regency|Tabanan]], capital [[Tabanan]]

== Economy ==
Three decades ago, the Balinese economy was largely agriculture-based in terms of both output and employment. Tourism is now the largest single industry; and as a result, Bali is one of Indonesia’s wealthiest regions. About 80% of Bali's economy depends on tourism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,393799,00.html Desperately Seeking Survival]. Time. 25 November 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; The economy, however, suffered significantly as a result of the terrorist bombings [[2002 Bali bombing|2002]] and [[2005 Bali bombing|2005]]. The tourism industry is slowly recovering once again.

=== Agriculture ===
[[Image:1 Tegalalang rice terrace ubud bali.jpg|thumb|Tegalalang rice terrace in [[Ubud]]]]
Although tourism produces the GDP's largest output, agriculture is still the island’s biggest employer;&lt;ref&gt;On history of rice-growing related to museology and the rice terraces as part of Bali's cultural heritage see: Marc-Antonio Barblan, &quot;D'Orient en Occident: histoire de la riziculture et muséologie&quot; in ''''ICOFOM Study Series'', Vol.35 (2006), pp.114–131. [http://www.lrz-muenchen.de/~iims/icofom/press.htm LRZ-Muenchen.de] and &quot;Dans la lumière des terrasses: paysage culturel balinais, ''Subek Museum''et patrimoine mondial (1er volet) &quot;in ''Le Banian'' (Paris), juin 2009, pp.80–101, [http://pasarmalam.free.fr Pasarmalam.free.fr]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} most notably [[rice]] cultivation. Crops grown in smaller amounts include fruit, vegetables, ''[[Coffea arabica]]'' and other [[cash crop|cash]] and subsistence crops.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Fishing also provides a significant number of jobs. Bali is also famous for its [[artisan]]s who produce a vast array of handicrafts, including [[batik]] and [[ikat]] cloth and clothing, [[Woodworking|wooden carvings]], stone carvings, painted art and silverware. Notably, individual villages typically adopt a single product, such as wind chimes or wooden furniture.

The Arabica coffee production region is the highland region of Kintamani near [[Mount Batur]]. Generally, Balinese coffee is processed using the wet method. This results in a sweet, soft coffee with good consistency. Typical flavors include lemon and other citrus notes.&lt;ref name=&quot;SCAI&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.sca-indo.org/diverse-coffees-indonesia/|title=Diverse coffees of Indonesia|work=Specialty Coffee Association of Indonesia|accessdate=8 August 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080802030333/http://www.sca-indo.org/diverse-coffees-indonesia/ &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many coffee farmers in Kintamani are members of a traditional farming system called Subak Abian, which is based on the [[Hindu]] philosophy of &quot;Tri Hita Karana”. According to this philosophy, the three causes of happiness are good relations with God, other people and the environment. The Subak Abian system is ideally suited to the production of fair trade and organic coffee production. Arabica coffee from Kintamani is the first product in Indonesia to request a [[Geographical Indication]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BaliKintamani&quot;&gt;&quot;Book of Requirements for Kopi Kintamani Bali&quot;, page 12, July 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tourism ===
[[File:1 tirtha empul temple.jpg|thumb|The [[Tirtha Empul Temple]] draws a fair share of tourists who seek its holy waters]]
[[File:1 pura taman ayun bali 2011.jpg|thumb|Pura Taman Ayun, another temple which is a popular tourist destination]]

The tourism industry is primarily focused in the south, while significant in the other parts of the island as well. The main tourist locations are the town of [[Kuta]] (with its beach), and its outer suburbs of Legian and [[Seminyak]] (which were once independent townships), the east coast town of [[Sanur (Bali)|Sanur]] (once the only tourist hub), in the center of the island [[Ubud]], to the south of the [[Ngurah Rai International Airport]], [[Jimbaran]], and the newer development of [[Nusa Dua]] and [[Pecatu]].

The American government lifted its travel warnings in 2008. As of 2009, the Australian government still rates it at a 4 danger level (the same as several countries in [[central Africa]]) on a scale of 5.

An offshoot of tourism is the growing real estate industry. Bali real estate has been rapidly developing in the main tourist areas of Kuta, Legian, Seminyak and Oberoi. Most recently, high-end 5 star projects are under development on the Bukit peninsula, on the south side of the island. Million dollar villas are being developed along the cliff sides of south Bali, commanding panoramic ocean views. Foreign and domestic (many Jakarta individuals and companies are fairly active) investment into other areas of the island also continues to grow. Land prices, despite the worldwide economic crisis, have remained stable.

In the last half of 2008, Indonesia's currency had dropped approximately 30% against the US dollar, providing many overseas visitors value for their currencies. Visitor arrivals for 2009 were forecast to drop 8% (which would be higher than 2007 levels), due to the worldwide economic crisis which has also affected the global tourist industry, but not due to any travel warnings.

Bali's tourism economy survived the terrorist bombings of 2002 and 2005, and the tourism industry has in fact slowly recovered and surpassed its pre-terrorist bombing levels; the longterm trend has been a steady increase of visitor arrivals. At 2010, Bali received 2.57 million foreign tourists. It is surpassed the target of 2.0-2.3 million tourists. The average occupancy of starred hotels achieved 65 percent (last year 60.8 percent), so still capable for accommodates tourists for next some years without any addition of new rooms/hotels,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thebalitimes.com/2011/02/17/up-to-2-8m-foreign-tourists-this-year/&lt;/ref&gt; although at the peak season some of them are fully booked.

Bali received the Best Island award from [[Travel and Leisure]] in 2010. The award was presented in the show &quot;World's Best Awards 2010&quot; in New York, on 21 July. Hotel Four Seasons Resort Bali at [[Jimbaran]] also received an award in the category of &quot;World Best Hotel Spas in Asia 2010&quot;. The award was based on a survey of travel magazine [[Travel + Leisure]] readers between 15 December 2009 through 31 March 2010, and was judged on several criteria. The Ayana Resort received the designation; #1 Spa in the world by Conde Naste's Traveller Magazine for 2010 by their readers poll . The island of Bali won because of its attractive surroundings (both mountain and coastal areas), diverse tourist attractions, excellent international and local restaurants, and the friendliness of the local people.

== Transportation ==
[[File:Bali moped col.jpg|thumb|A major form of transport in Bali is the [[Moped]]]]
The [[Ngurah Rai Airport|Ngurah Rai International Airport]] is located near Jimbaran, on the [[isthmus]] at the southernmost part of the island. [[Lt.Col. Wisnu Airfield]] is found in north-west Bali.

A coastal road surrounds the island, and three major two-lane arteries cross the central mountains at passes reaching to 1,750m in height (at Penelokan). The Ngurah Rai Bypass is a four-lane expressway that partly encircles Denpasar and enables cars to travel quickly in the heavily populated south. Bali has no railway lines.

December 2010: Government of Indonesia has invited investors to build Tanah Ampo Cruise Terminal at [[Karangasem]], Bali amounted $30&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/business/infrastructure-projects-in-indonesia-thrown-open-for-bids/412805&lt;/ref&gt;

A Memorandum of Understanding has been signed by 2 ministers, Bali's Governor and [[PT Kereta Api|Indonesian Train Company]] to build 565 kilometers railway along the coast around the island. It will be operated from 2015 onwards.&lt;ref&gt;http://goodnewsfromindonesia.org/2011/01/05/what-train-bali/&lt;/ref&gt;

A 11.4 kilometers [[Serangan]]-[[Tanjung Benoa]] toll road will be built since mid-2011 by [[Jasamarga]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/03/10/jasa-marga-seek-rp175t-loan-build-toll-roads.html&lt;/ref&gt;
On March 16, 2011 (Tanjung) Benoa port has received a &quot;Best Port Welcome 2010&quot; award from London's &quot;Dream World Cruise Destination&quot; magazine.&lt;ref&gt;http://english.kompas.com/read/2011/03/21/15463549/.Best.Port.Welcome.Awarded.to.Balis.Benoa.Port&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 2011, an integrated Areal Traffic Control System (ATCS) has implemented to reduce traffic jams in 4 crossing points, i.e.: Ngurah Rai statue, Dewa Ruci Kuta crossing, Jimbaran crossing and Sanur crossing. ATCS is an integrated system connecting all traffic lights, CCTVs and other traffic signals with a monitoring office at the police headquarters and has successfully implemented at other ASEAN countries and will be implemented at other crossing in Bali.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mediaindonesia.com/read/2011/05/12/225490/290/101/Pemprov-Bali-Gunakan-Teknologi-Baru-Atasi-Kemacetan&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/05/25/new-traffic-control-system-buses-hoped-ease-congestion.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Demographics ==
The population of Bali is 3,151,000 (as of 2005). There are an estimated 30,000 expatriates living in Bali.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cifamerica/2008/oct/30/barack-obama-absentee-voting-bali Ballots in paradise]. Guardian.co.uk. 30 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Religion ===
[[File:Mother Temple of Besakih.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Mother Temple of Besakih]], one of Bali's most significant [[Hindu]] temples.]]
[[File:Ubud Cremation Procession 1.jpg|thumb|right|A religious procession]]

Unlike most of [[Islam|Muslim]]-majority Indonesia, about 93.18% of Bali's population adheres to [[Balinese Hinduism]], formed as a combination of existing [[Balinese mythology|local beliefs]] and [[Hindu]] influences from mainland [[Southeast Asia]] and [[South Asia]]. Minority religions include [[Islam]] (4.79%), [[Christianity]] (1.38%), and [[Buddhism]] (0.64%). These figures do not include immigrants from other parts of Indonesia.

When Islam surpassed Hinduism in [[Java]] (16th century), Bali became a refuge for many Hindus. Balinese Hinduism is an amalgam in which gods and demigods are worshipped together with Buddhist heroes, the spirits of ancestors, indigenous agricultural deities and sacred places. Religion as it is practiced in Bali is a composite belief system that embraces not only theology, philosophy, and mythology, but ancestor worship, animism and magic. It pervades nearly every aspect of traditional life. [[Caste]] is observed, though less strictly than in India. With an estimated 20,000 [[Pura (Balinese temple)|puras (temples)]] and shrines, Bali is known as the &quot;Island of a Thousand Puras&quot;, or &quot;Island of the Gods&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/news/bali/everyday-spirits/2008/05/01/1209235036507.html Everyday spirits]. Theage.com.au. 3 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Balinese Hinduism has roots in Indian Hinduism and in Buddhism, and adopted the animistic traditions of the indigenous people. This influence strengthened the belief that the gods and goddesses are present in all things. Every element of nature, therefore, possesses its own power, which reflects the power of the gods. A rock, tree, dagger, or woven cloth is a potential home for spirits whose energy can be directed for good or evil. Balinese Hinduism is deeply interwoven with art and ritual. Ritualizing states of self-control are a notable feature of religious expression among the people, who for this reason have become famous for their graceful and decorous behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Slattum, J. (2003) ''Balinese Masks: Spirits of an Ancient Drama. Indonesia, Asia Pacific, Japan, North America, Latin America and Europe'' Periplus Editions (HK) Ltd&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from the majority of Balinese Hindus, there also exist [[Chinese Indonesian|Chinese]] immigrants whose traditions have melded with that of the locals. As a result, these Sino-Balinese not only embrace their original religion, which is a mixture of Buddhism, Taoism and Confucianism, but also find a way to harmonize it with the local traditions. Hence, it is not uncommon to find local Sino-Balinese during the local temple's ''odalan''. Moreover, Balinese Hindu priests are invited to perform rites alongside a Chinese priest in the event of the death of a Sino-Balinese.&lt;ref&gt;[http://voiceoftheshadows.blogspot.com/2009/04/short-post.html Blogspot.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the Sino-Balinese claim to embrace Buddhism for administrative purposes, such as their Identity Cards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://voiceoftheshadows.blogspot.com/2009/05/hectic-yet-void-week.html Blogspot.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Language ===
[[Balinese language|Balinese]] and [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] are the most widely spoken languages in Bali, and the vast majority of Balinese people are [[bilingual]] or [[trilingual]]. There are several indigenous Balinese languages, but most Balinese can also use the most widely spoken option: modern common Balinese. The usage of different Balinese languages was traditionally determined by the [[Balinese caste system]] and by clan membership, but this tradition is diminishing.

[[English language|English]] is a common third language (and the primary foreign language) of many Balinese, owing to the requirements of the [[tourism industry]].

[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM De beroemde Balinese danser I Mario TMnr 10004713.jpg|thumb|The famous dancer i Mario, picture taken 1940.]]
Bali is renowned for its diverse and sophisticated art forms, such as painting, sculpture, woodcarving, handcrafts, and performing arts. Balinese percussion orchestra music, known as ''[[gamelan]]'', is highly developed and varied. Balinese performing arts often portray stories from Hindu epics such as the [[Ramayana]] but with heavy Balinese influence. Famous Balinese dances include ''[[pendet]]'', ''[[legong]]'', ''[[baris (dance)|baris]]'', ''[[topeng]]'', ''[[barong (mythology)|barong]]'', ''[[Gamelan gong kebyar|gong keybar]]'', and ''[[kecak]]'' (the monkey dance). Bali boasts one of the most diverse and innovative performing arts cultures in the world, with paid performances at thousands of temple festivals, private ceremonies, or public shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Masked Performance: The Play of Self and Other in Ritual and Theatre|last=Emigh|first=John|authorlink=John Emigh|year=1996|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=081221336X}} The author is a Western theatre professor who has become a performer in Balinese [[topeng]] theater himself.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hindu New Year, ''[[Nyepi]]'', is celebrated in the spring by a day of silence. On this day everyone stays at home and tourists are encouraged to remain in their hotels. But the day before that large, colourful sculptures of ''ogoh-ogoh'' monsters are paraded and finally burned in the evening to drive away evil spirits. Other festivals throughout the year are specified by the Balinese ''[[pawukon]]'' [[calendar|calendrical]] system.

[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Portert van twee jonge Balinese danseressen TMnr 10004678b.jpg|thumb|Balinese dancers wearing elaborate headgear, photographed in 1929. Digitally restored.]]

Celebrations are held for many occasions such as a tooth-filing (coming-of-age ritual), cremation or ''odalan'' (temple festival). One of the most important concepts that Balinese ceremonies have in common is that of ''désa kala patra'', which refers to how ritual performances must be appropriate in both the specific and general social context.&lt;ref&gt;Herbst 1997, p. 1-2.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the ceremonial art forms such as ''[[wayang|wayang kulit]]'' and ''[[topeng]]'' are highly improvisatory, providing flexibility for the performer to adapt the performance to the current situation.&lt;ref&gt;Foley and Sedana 2005, p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt; Many celebrations call for a loud, boisterous atmosphere with lots of activity and the resulting aesthetic, ''ramé'', is distinctively Balinese. Oftentimes two or more ''[[Music of Bali|gamelan]]'' ensembles will be performing well within earshot, and sometimes compete with each other in order to be heard. Likewise, the audience members talk amongst themselves, get up and walk around, or even cheer on the performance, which adds to the many layers of activity and the liveliness typical of ''ramé''.&lt;ref&gt;Gold 2005, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Balinese Stone Carvings.jpg|thumb|Stone carvings in Ubud.]]

''Kaja'' and ''kelod'' are the Balinese equivalents of North and South, which refer to ones orientation between the island’s largest mountain Gunung Agung (''kaja''), and the sea (''kelod''). In addition to spatial orientation, ''kaja'' and ''kelod'' have the connotation of good and evil; gods and ancestors are believed to live on the mountain whereas demons live in the sea. Buildings such as temples and residential homes are spatially oriented by having the most sacred spaces closest to the mountain and the unclean places nearest to the sea.&lt;ref&gt;Herbst 1997, p. 1-2.; Gold 2005, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most temples have an inner courtyard and an outer courtyard which are arranged with the inner courtyard furthest ''kaja''. These spaces serve as performance venues since most Balinese rituals are accompanied by any combination of music, dance and drama. The performances that take place in the inner courtyard are classified as ''wali'', the most sacred rituals which are offerings exclusively for the gods, while the outer courtyard is where ''bebali'' ceremonies are held, which are intended for gods and people. Lastly, performances meant solely for the entertainment of humans take place outside the walls of the temple and are called ''bali-balihan''. This three-tiered system of classification was standardized in 1971 by a committee of Balinese officials and artists in order to better protect the sanctity of the oldest and most sacred Balinese rituals from being performed for a paying audience.&lt;ref&gt;Gold 2005, p. 18-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tourism, Bali’s chief industry, has provided the island with a foreign audience that is eager to pay for entertainment, thus creating new performance opportunities and more demand for performers. The impact of [[tourism in indonesia|tourism]] is controversial since before it became integrated into the economy, the Balinese performing arts did not exist as a capitalist venture, and were not performed for entertainment outside of their respective ritual context. Since the 1930s sacred rituals such as the ''[[barong (mythology)|barong]]'' dance have been performed both in their original contexts, as well as exclusively for paying tourists. This has led to new versions of many of these performances which have developed according to the preferences of foreign audiences; some villages have a ''barong'' mask specifically for non-ritual performances as well as an older mask which is only used for sacred performances.&lt;ref&gt;Sanger 1988, p. 90-93.&lt;/ref&gt;

Balinese society continues to revolve around each family's ancestral village, to which the cycle of life and religion is closely tied.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Belford|first=Aubrey|title=Customary Law Revival Neglects Some Balinese|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/13/world/asia/13iht-bali.html|accessdate=12 October 2010|newspaper=[[New York Times]]|date=12 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coercive aspects of traditional society, such as [[customary law]] sanctions imposed by traditional authorities such as village councils (including &quot;[[kasepekang]]&quot;, or [[shunning]]) have risen in importance as a consequence of the democratization and decentralization of Indonesia since 1998.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT&quot; /&gt;

'''Bulgarian''' (български език, {{IPA-bg|ˈbɤ̞ɫɡɐrski ɛˈzik|pron}}) is an [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European language]], a member of the [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] linguistic group.

Following the efforts of some figures of the [[National awakening of Bulgaria]] (the most notable among them being [[Neofit Rilski]] and [[Ivan Bogorov]]),&lt;ref&gt;Michal Kopeček. ''Discourses of collective identity in Central and Southeast Europe (1770-1945): texts and commentaries, Volume 1'' (Central European University Press, 2006), p. 248&lt;/ref&gt; there had been many attempts to [[Codification (linguistics)|codify]] a [[Standard language|standard]] Bulgarian language; however, there was much argument surrounding the choice of norms.&lt;ref&gt;Glanville Price. ''Encyclopedia of the languages of Europe'' (Wiley-Blackwell, 2000), p.45&lt;/ref&gt; Between [[1835]]–[[1878]] more than 25 proposals were put forward&lt;ref&gt;Glanville Price. ''Encyclopedia of the languages of Europe'' (Wiley-Blackwell, 2000), p.45&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;linguistic chaos&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Glanville Price. ''Encyclopedia of the languages of Europe'' (Wiley-Blackwell, 2000), p.45&lt;/ref&gt; ensued. Eventually the Eastern dialects prevailed&lt;ref&gt;Victor Roudometof.

Bulgarian demonstrates several linguistic characteristics that set it apart from all other [[Slavic languages]], such as the elimination of [[grammatical case|case declension]], the development of a suffixed [[definite article]] (see [[Balkan linguistic union]]), the lack of a verb [[infinitive]], and the retention and further development of the [[Proto-Slavic language|Proto-Slavic]] verb system. Various [[evidentiality|evidential]] verb forms exist to express unwitnessed, retold, and doubtful action.

==History==
{{Main|History of Bulgarian}}

The development of the Bulgarian language may be divided into several periods.
*'''Prehistoric period''' - occurred between the Slavonic migration to eastern Balkans and the mission of [[Saints Cyril and Methodius]] to Great Moravia in the 860s.
*'''[[Old Church Slavonic|Old Bulgarian]]''' (9th to 11th century, also referred to as [[Old Church Slavonic]]) - a literary norm of the early southern dialect of the [[Common Slavic]] language from which Bulgarian evolved. It was used by [[Saints Cyril and Methodius]] and their disciples to translate the [[Bible]] and other liturgical literature from [[Greek language|Greek]] into Slavic.
*'''Middle Bulgarian''' (12th to 15th century) - a literary norm that evolved from the earlier Old Bulgarian, after major innovations were accepted. It was a language of rich literary activity and the official administration language of the [[Second Bulgarian Empire]].
*'''Modern Bulgarian''' - dates from the 16th century onwards, undergoing general grammar and syntax changes in the 18th and 19th centuries. Present-day written Bulgarian language was standardized on the basis of the 19th-century Bulgarian vernacular. The historical development of the Bulgarian language can be described as a transition from a highly [[synthetic language]] (Old Bulgarian) to a typical [[analytic language]] (Modern Bulgarian) with Middle Bulgarian as a midpoint in this transition.
[[File:ZographensisColour.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[Codex Zographensis]] one of the oldest [[manuscript]]s in the Old Bulgarian language dated from the late 10th or early 11th century]]
''Bulgarian'' was the first &quot;Slavic&quot; language attested in writing. As Slavic linguistic unity lasted into late antiquity, in the oldest manuscripts this language was initially referred to as языкъ словяньскъ, &quot;the Slavic language&quot;. In the Middle Bulgarian period this name was gradually replaced by the name языкъ блъгарьскъ, the &quot;Bulgarian language&quot;. In some cases, the name языкъ блъгарьскъ was used not only with regard to the contemporary Middle Bulgarian language of the copyist but also to the period of Old Bulgarian. A most notable example of anachronism is the Service of [[Saints Cyril and Methodius|St. Cyril]] from Skopje (Скопски миней), a 13th century Middle Bulgarian manuscript from northern [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] according to which St. Cyril preached with &quot;Bulgarian&quot; books among the Moravian Slavs. The first mention of the language as the &quot;Bulgarian language&quot; instead of the &quot;Slavonic language&quot; comes in the work of the Greek clergy of the [[Bulgarian Archbishopric of Ohrid]] in the 11th century, for example in the [[Greek language|Greek]] hagiography of [[Saint Clement of Ohrid]] by [[Theophylact of Bulgaria|Theophylact]] of Ohrid (late 11th century).

During the Middle Bulgarian period, the language underwent dramatic changes, losing the Slavonic case system, but preserving the rich verb system (while the development was exactly the opposite in other Slavic languages) and developing a definite article. Consequently, modern Bulgarian is about as far from Russian as [[Swedish language|Swedish]] is from [[German language|German]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} It was influenced by proto-Bulgar and its non-Slavic neighbors in the [[Balkan linguistic union]] (mostly grammatically) and later also by [[Turkish language|Turkish]], which was the official language of the [[Ottoman Empire]], in the form of the [[Ottoman Turkish language]], mostly lexically. As a [[national revival]] occurred towards the end of the period of Ottoman rule (mostly during the 19th century), a modern Bulgarian literary language gradually emerged which drew heavily on [[Old Church Slavonic language|Church Slavonic/Old Bulgarian]] (and to some extent on literary [[Russian language|Russian]], which had preserved many lexical items from Church Slavonic) and later reduced the number of Turkish and other Balkanic loans. Today one difference between Bulgarian dialects in the country and literary spoken Bulgarian is the significant presence of Old Bulgarian words and even word forms in the latter. Russian loans are distinguished from Old Bulgarian ones on the basis of the presence of specifically Russian phonetic changes, as in оборот (turnover, rev), непонятен (incomprehensible), ядро (nucleus) and others. As usual in such cases, many other loans from French, English and the [[classical language]]s have subsequently entered the language as well.

Modern Bulgarian was based essentially on the Eastern dialects of the language, but its pronunciation is in many respects a compromise between East and West Bulgarian (see especially the phonetic sections below).

==Dialects==
:{{Main|Bulgarian dialects}}

[[File:Bulgarian dialects by Todor Bozhinov.png|right|thumb|350px|Map of the Bulgarian dialects within Bulgaria]]
The language is mainly split into two broad dialect areas, based on the different reflexes of the [[Common Slavic language|Common Slavic]] [[yat]] vowel ({{Unicode|Ѣ}}). This split, which occurred at some point during the Middle Ages, led to the development of Bulgaria's:

*Western dialects (informally called ''твърд говор/tvurd govor'' - &quot;hard speech&quot;)
**the former ''yat'' is pronounced &quot;e&quot; in all positions. e.g. ''млеко (mlekò)'' – milk, ''хлеб (hleb)'' – bread.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.promacedonia.org/jchorb/st/st_2_b_izt_0.htm |title=Стойков, Стойко. 2002 (1962) Българска диалектология. Стр. 101 |publisher=Promacedonia.org |date= |accessdate=2010-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Eastern dialects (informally called ''мек говор/mek govor'' – &quot;soft speech&quot;)
**the former ''yat'' alternates between &quot;ya&quot; and &quot;e&quot;: it is pronounced &quot;ya&quot; if it is under stress and the next syllable does not contain a [[front vowel]] (''e'' or ''i'') — e.g. ''мляко (mlyàko)'', ''хляб (hlyab)'', and &quot;ye&quot; otherwise — e.g. ''млекар (mlekàr)'' – milkman, ''хлебар (hlebàr)'' – baker. This rule obtains in most Eastern dialects, although some have &quot;ya&quot;, or a special &quot;open e&quot; sound, in all positions.

The literary language norm, which is generally based on the Eastern dialects, also has the Eastern alternating reflex of ''yat''. However, it has not incorporated the general Eastern umlaut of ''all'' synchronic or even historic &quot;ya&quot; sounds into &quot;e&quot; before front vowels — e.g. ''поляна (polyana)'' vs ''полени (poleni)'' &quot;meadow – meadows&quot; or even ''жаба (zhaba)'' vs ''жеби (zhebi)'' &quot;frog – frogs&quot;, even though it co-occurs with the yat alternation in almost all Eastern dialects that have it (except a few dialects along the yat border, e.g. in the [[Pleven]] region).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.promacedonia.org/jchorb/st/st_2_b_izt_0.htm |title=Стойков, Стойко. 2002 (1962) Българска диалектология. Стр. 99 |publisher=Promacedonia.org |date= |accessdate=2010-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More examples of the ''yat'' umlaut in the literary language are:

*''mly'''à'''ko'' (milk) [n.] → ''ml'''e'''kàr'' (milkman); ''ml'''è'''chen'' (milky), etc.
*''sy'''à'''dam'' (sit) [vb.] → ''s'''e'''dàlka'' (seat); ''s'''e'''dàlishte'' (seat, e.g. of government), etc.
*''svy'''a'''t'' (holy) [adj.] → ''sv'''e'''tètz'' (saint); ''sv'''e'''tìlishte'' (sanctuary), etc.

Until 1945, Bulgarian orthography did not reveal this alternation and used the original [[Old Church Slavonic|Old Slavic]] [[Cyrillic]] letter ''yat'' ({{Unicode|Ѣ}}), which was commonly called ''двойно е (dvoyno e)'' at the time, to express the historical ''yat'' vowel or at least root vowels displaying the ''ya – e'' alternation. The letter was used in each occurrence of such a root, regardless of the actual pronunciation of the vowel: thus, both ''ml'''ya'''ko'' and ''ml'''e'''kar'' were spelled with ({{Unicode|Ѣ}}). &lt;!--If anyone doubts, as the previous wording seemed to suggest, that the Eastern alternation was already considered literary norm at the time, see e.g. Младенов, Стефан. Български етимологичен речник. 1941. p.XV-XVII.--&gt; Among other things, this was seen as a way to &quot;reconcile&quot; the Western and the Eastern dialects and maintain language unity at a time when much of Bulgaria's Western dialect area was controlled by [[Serbia]] and [[Greece]], but there were still hopes and occasional attempts to recover it. With the 1945 orthographic reform, this letter was abolished and the present spelling was introduced, reflecting the alternation in pronunciation.

This had implications for some grammatical constructions:
*The third person plural pronoun and its derivatives. Before 1945 the pronoun &quot;they&quot; was spelled ''{{Unicode|тѣ}} (tě)'', and its derivatives took this as the root. After the orthographic change, the pronoun and its derivatives were given an equal share of soft and hard spellings:
**&quot;they&quot; – ''те (te)'' → &quot;them&quot; – ''тях (tyah)'';
**&quot;their(s)&quot; – ''tehen'' (masc.); ''tyahna'' (fem.); ''tyahno'' (neut.); ''tehni'' (plur.)
*adjectives received the same treatment as ''{{Unicode|тѢ}}'' :
**&quot;whole&quot; – ''tsyal'' → &quot;the whole...&quot;: ''tseliyat'' (masc.); ''tsyalata'' (fem.); ''tsyaloto'' (neut.); ''tselite'' (plur.)

Sometimes, with the changes, words began to be spelled as other words with different meanings, e.g.:
*''{{Unicode|свѣт}} (svět)'' – &quot;holy&quot; became ''свят (svyat)'', spelt and pronounced the same as ''свят'' – &quot;world&quot;.
*''{{Unicode|тѣ}} (tě)'' – &quot;they&quot; became ''те (te)'', the same as the second person direct object pronoun ''те'' – &quot;you&quot;.

In spite of the literary norm regarding the yat vowel, many people living in Western Bulgaria, including the capital [[Sofia]], will fail to observe its rules. While the norm requires the realizations ''vidyal'' vs ''videli'' (he has seen; they have seen), some natives of Western Bulgaria will preserve their local dialect pronunciation with &quot;e&quot; for all instances of &quot;yat&quot; (e.g. ''videl'', ''videli''). Others, attempting to adhere to the norm, will actually use the &quot;ya&quot; sound even in cases where the standard language has &quot;e&quot; (e.g. ''vidyal'', ''vidyali''). The latter [[hypercorrection#Bulgarian|hypercorrection]] is called ''свръхякане'' (''&quot;svrah-yakane&quot;'' ≈&quot;over-softening&quot;).

==Relationship to Macedonian==
Most sources in and out of Bulgaria before the Second World War referred to the [[South Slavic dialect continuum|southern Slavonic dialect continuum]] covering the area of today's [[Republic of Macedonia]] as a group of Bulgarian dialects.&lt;ref name=foreigners&gt;Mazon, Andre.

However, the Bulgarian codifiers did not want to make any allowances for a ''pluricentric'' Bulgarian language, which might have include the Macedonian dialects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=wawGFWNuHiwC&amp;pg=PA440&amp;dq=bulgaro+macedonian+language&amp;hl=bg&amp;ei=LcPTTc-XC9CUswaa1fTiAg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=bulgaro%20macedonian%20language&amp;f=false Pluricentric languages: differing norms in different nations, Michael G.

After 1958 when the pressure from Moscow decreased, Sofia turned back to the view that the [[Macedonian language]] did not exist as a separate language. Some modern linguists consider Macedonian dialects still as Bulgarian, but this view is politically controversial.&lt;ref name=&quot;ucla&quot;&gt;[http://www.lmp.ucla.edu/Profile.aspx?menu=004&amp;LangID=42 Language profile Macedonian], UCLA International Institute&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=ppbuavUZKEwC&amp;pg=PA116&amp;dq=macedonian+language+dialect+of++bulgarian&amp;lr=&amp;hl=bg#v=onepage&amp;q=macedonian%20language%20dialect%20of%20%20bulgarian&amp;f=false Who are the Macedonians?, Hugh Poulton, C.

==Alphabet==
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Diacritic]] --&gt;

In 886 AD, the [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian Empire]] introduced the [[Glagolitic alphabet]] which was devised by the [[Saints Cyril and Methodius]] in the 850s. The Glagolitic alphabet was gradually superseded in later centuries by the [[Cyrillic alphabet]], developed around the [[Preslav Literary School]], [[Bulgaria]] in the beginning of the 10th century.

Several Cyrillic alphabets with 28 to 44 letters were used in the beginning and the middle of the 19th century during the efforts on the codification of Modern Bulgarian until an alphabet with 32 letters, proposed by [[Marin Drinov]], gained prominence in the 1870s. The alphabet of Marin Drinov was used until the orthographic reform of 1945 when the letters [[yat]] {{Unicode|([[Yat|Ѣ]], ѣ}} [æː], called &quot;double e&quot;), and [[yus]] {{Unicode|([[Big Yus|Ѫ]], ѫ}} [ɔ̃], called &quot;big yus&quot; or &quot;''ъ кръстато''&quot;) were removed from the alphabet, reducing the number of letters to 30.

Nowadays the Bulgarian language is written in the Cyrillic alphabet.

With the [[accession of Bulgaria to the European Union]] on January 1, 2007, Cyrillic became the third official alphabet of the [[EU]].

The following table gives the letters of the Bulgarian alphabet, along with the [[help:IPA|IPA]] values for the sound of each letter:

&lt;small&gt;1 The romanizations of these characters differ from the current version, [[ISO_9#ISO_9:1995|ISO 9:1995]], as it was never officially adopted as a Bulgarian [[Romanization_of_Bulgarian#Standards|standard]].&lt;/small&gt;

Most letters in the Bulgarian alphabet stand for just one specific sound. Three letters stand for the single expression of combinations of sounds, namely [[Shcha|щ]] (sht), [[Yu (Cyrillic)|ю]] (yu), and [[Ya (Cyrillic)|я]] (ya). Two sounds do not correspond to separate letters, but are expressed as the combination of two letters, namely дж ({{IPA|/dʒ/}}) and дз ({{IPA|/dz/}}). The letter ь marks the softening ([[palatalization]]) of any consonant before {{IPA|/ɔ/}}.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

The names of the letters are simple representations of their phonetic values, with all consonants being followed by {{IPA|/ɤ/}} — thus the alphabet goes: {{IPA|/a/}} - {{IPA|/bɤ/}} - {{IPA|/vɤ/}}, etc. Й is known as &quot;и-kratko&quot; (''short /i/''), Ъ as &quot;er-golyam&quot; (''large [[Yer|Er]]''), and Ь as &quot;er-maluk&quot; (''small Er''). When saying the alphabet fast, people often omit to say Й and Ь, and say Ъ simply as {{IPA|/ɤ/}}.

Bulgarian's eight vowels may be grouped in three pairs according to their backness: front, central and back. All vowels are relatively lax, as in most other [[Slavic languages]], and unlike the [[Tenseness|tense vowels]], for example, in the [[Germanic languages]]{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}. Unstressed vowels tend to be shorter and weaker compared to their [[stress (linguistics)|stressed]] counterparts, and the corresponding pairs of open and closed vowels approach each other with a tendency to merge, above all as [[low vowel|low]] ([[open vowel|open]] and [[open-mid vowel|open-mid]]) vowels are raised and shift towards the [[high vowel|high]] ([[close vowel|close]] and [[close-mid vowel|close-mid]]) ones. However, the coalescence is not always complete. The vowels are often distinguished in emphatic or deliberately distinct pronunciation, and reduction is strongest in colloquial speech. Besides that, some linguists distinguish two degrees of reduction, as they have found that a clearer distinction tends to be maintained in the syllable immediately preceding the stressed one. The complete merger of the pair {{IPA|/a/}} - {{IPA|/ɤ/}} is regarded as most common, while the status of {{IPA|/ɔ/}} vs {{IPA|/u/}} is less clear. A coalescence of {{IPA|/ɛ/}} and {{IPA|/i/}} is not allowed in formal speech and is regarded as a provincial (East Bulgarian) dialect feature; instead, unstressed {{IPA|/ɛ/}} is both raised and [[centralization (phonetics)|centralized]], approaching {{IPA|[ɤ]}}.&lt;ref&gt;Жобов, Владимир (2004) Звуковете в българския език. Стр. 44-45.&lt;/ref&gt; The {{IPA|/ɤ/}} vowel itself does not exist as a [[phoneme]] in other Slavic languages, though a similar reduced vowel transcribed as {{IPA|[ə]}} does occur.

===Semivowels===
The Bulgarian language possesses one [[semivowel]]: {{IPA|/j/}}, being equivalent to '''y''' in English like in ''yes''. It is expressed graphically with the letter '''[[short I|й]]''', as in най {{IPA|/naj/}} (&quot;most&quot;), тролей {{IPA|/trɔlɛj/}} (&quot;trolleybus&quot;), except when it precedes {{IPA|/a/}} or {{IPA|/u/}}, in which case the combination of two phonemes is expressed with a single letter, respectively я or ю: (e.g. ютия {{IPA|/jutija/}} &quot;(flat) iron&quot;).

===Consonants===
Bulgarian has a total of 35 consonant [[phonemes]] (see table below). Three additional phonemes can also be found ({{IPA|[xʲ]}}, {{IPA|[d͡z]}}, and {{IPA|[d͡zʲ]}}), but only in foreign [[proper names]] such as Хюстън {{IPA|/xʲustɤn/}} (&quot;Houston&quot;), Дзержински {{IPA|/d͡zɛrʒinski/}} (&quot;Dzerzhinsky&quot;), and Ядзя {{IPA|/jad͡zʲa/}}, the Polish name &quot;Jadzia&quot;. They are, however, normally not considered part of the phonetic inventory of the Bulgarian language. According to the criterion of sonority, the Bulgarian consonants may be divided into 12 pairs (voiced&lt;&gt;voiceless). The only consonant without a counterpart is the [[voiceless velar fricative]] {{IPA|/x/}}. The contrast 'voiced vs. voiceless' is neutralized in word-final position, where [[Final obstruent devoicing|all obstruents are pronounced as voiceless]] (as in most [[Slavic languages]]); this neutralization is, however, not reflected in the spelling.

====Hard and palatalized consonants====
The Bulgarian consonants б {{IPA|/b/}}, в {{IPA|/v/}}, г {{IPA|/ɡ/}}, д {{IPA|/d/}}, з {{IPA|/z/}}, к {{IPA|/k/}}, л {{IPA|/l//ɫ/}}, м {{IPA|/m/}}, н {{IPA|/n/}}, п {{IPA|/p/}}, р {{IPA|/r/}}, с {{IPA|/s/}}, т {{IPA|/t/}}, ф {{IPA|/f/}}, ц {{IPA|/t͡s/}} can denote both a normal, &quot;hard&quot; pronunciation, as well as a &quot;soft&quot;, palatalized one. The hard and the palatalized consonants are considered separate [[phonemes]] in Bulgarian. The consonants ж {{IPA|/ʒ/}}, ш {{IPA|/ʃ/}}, ч {{IPA|/t͡ʃ/}} and дж {{IPA|/d͡ʒ/}} do not have palatalized variants, which is probably connected with the fact that they have arisen historically through palatalization in [[Common Slavonic]]. These consonants may still be somewhat palatalized in some speakers' pronunciation, but as a rule this is not the case.

The softness of the palatalized consonants is always indicated in writing in Bulgarian. A consonant is palatalized if:
*it is followed by я {{IPA|/ ʲa/}}, ю {{IPA|/ ʲu/}}, or ьо {{IPA|/ ʲɔ/}}. (Note: ь occurs only before о in Bulgarian)

(When я and ю aren't preceded by a consonant, they signal that the vowels {{IPA|/a/}} and {{IPA|/u/}} are preceded by the semivowel {{IPA|/j/}}. For /jɔ/, Bulgarian uses &quot;йо&quot;, as in Ню Йорк, &quot;New York&quot;.)

Even though palatalized consonants are phonemes in Bulgarian, they may in some cases be positionally conditioned, hence redundant. In Eastern Bulgarian dialects, consonants are always allophonically palatalized before the vowels {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/ɛ/}}. This is not the case in Standard Bulgarian, but that form of the language does have similar allophonic alternations. Thus, к {{IPA|/k/}}, г {{IPA|/ɡ/}} and х {{IPA|/x/}} tend to be palatalized before {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/ɛ/}}, and the realization of the phoneme л {{IPA|/l/}} varies along the same principles: one of its allophones, involving a raising of the back of the tongue and a lowering of its middle part (thus similar or, according to some scholars, identical to a [[velarized alveolar lateral approximant|velarized lateral]]), occurs in all positions, except before the vowels {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/ɛ/}}, where a more &quot;clear&quot; version with a slight raising of the middle part of the tongue occurs. The latter pre-front realization is traditionally (and incorrectly) called &quot;soft l&quot;, even though it is ''not'' palatalized (and thus isn’t identical to the {{IPA|/lʲ/}} signalled by the letters ьо, я and ю). In some Western Bulgarian dialects, this allophonic variation does not exist.

Furthermore, in the speech of many young people the more common and arguably velarized allophone of {{IPA|/l/}} is often realized as a [[labiovelar]] [[approximant]] {{IPA|[w]}}.&lt;ref&gt;Жобов, Владимир (2004) Звуковете в българския език. Стр. 65-66.&lt;/ref&gt; This phenomenon, colloquially known as мързеливо &quot;л&quot; (lazy &quot;l&quot;) in Bulgaria, was first registered in the 1970s and isn't connected to original dialects. Similar developments, termed [[L-vocalization]], have occurred in many languages, including [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]], [[Brazilian Portuguese]] and certain dialects of English such as [[Cockney]] and [[AAVE]].

It is important to point out that even though it is traditionally accepted that palatal and non-palatal consonants are different phonemes, some researchers &lt;ref&gt;Куон Джин Чой (1998). Фонологичността на признака мекост в съвременния български език. http://liternet.bg/publish1/choi/mekost.htm&lt;/ref&gt; claim that only the non-palatal consonants can be considered phonemes (with hard and palatalized allophones). The reason for this is that words with a palatal consonant can be considered as having an &quot;underlying&quot; /j/ after the consonant (which is also reflected in the spelling). This [[palatal approximant]] makes the consonant palatal through [[regressive assimilation]]. This theory is supported by the fact that these palatal allophones do not normally appear in syllable-final position as in other [[Slavic languages]], such as [[Russian language|Russian]].

====Palatalization====
During the [[palatalization]] of most hard consonants (the bilabial, labiodental and alveolar ones), the middle part of the tongue is lifted towards the palatum, resulting in the formation of a second articulatory centre whereby the specific palatal &quot;clang&quot; of the soft consonants is achieved. The articulation of alveolars {{IPA|/l/}}, {{IPA|/n/}} and {{IPA|/r/}}, however, usually does not follow that rule; the palatal clang is achieved by moving the place of articulation further back towards the palatum so that {{IPA|/ʎ/}}, {{IPA|/ɲ/}} and {{IPA|/rʲ/}} are actually alveopalatal (postalvelolar) consonants. Soft {{IPA|/ɡ/}} and {{IPA|/k/}} ({{IPA|/ɡʲ/}} and {{IPA|/kʲ/}}, respectively) are articulated not on the velum but on the palatum and are considered [[palatal consonants]].

===Word stress===
Bulgarian [[lexical stress|word stress]] is ''dynamic''. Stressed syllables are louder and longer than unstressed ones. Stress, like Russian and other East Slavic languages, is also ''lexical'' rather than ''fixed'' as in French, Latin or the West Slavic ones, i.e. it may fall on any syllable of a polysyllabic word and its position may vary in inflection and derivation, for example, мъж {{IPA|/mɤʃ/}} ('man'), мъжът {{IPA|/mɤˈʒɤt/}} ('the man'). Bulgarian stress is also ''distinctive'': for example, в'ълна {{IPA|/ˈvɤɫnɐ/}} ('wool') and вълн'а {{IPA|/vɤɫˈna/}} ('wave') are only differentiated by stress (although there are few words that are distinguished using that criterium). Stress usually isn't signified in written text, though it may be indicated in cases with [[minimal pair]]s (e.g. ѝ 'to her', vs. и, 'and'), or in order to signify the dialectal deviation from the standard pronunciation. In such cases, stress is signified by placing a [[grave accent]] on the vowel of the stressed syllable.&lt;ref group=note&gt;For practical purposes, the grave accent can be [[Combining character|combined]] with letters by pasting the symbol &quot;&lt;tt&gt;&amp;#768;&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; directly after the designated letter. An alternative is to use the keyboard shortcut Alt + 0300 (if working under a [[Windows (operating system)|Windows operating system]]), or to add the decimal [[HTML code]] &quot;&lt;tt&gt;&amp;amp;#768;&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; after the targeted stressed vowel if editing HTML source code.

==Grammar==
{{Main|Bulgarian grammar}}
The parts of speech in Bulgarian are divided in 10 different types, which are categorized in two broad classes: mutable and immutable. The difference is that mutable parts of speech vary grammatically, whereas the immutable ones do not change, regardless of their use. The five classes of mutables are: ''nouns'', ''adjectives'', ''numerals'', ''pronouns'' and ''verbs''. Syntactically, the first four of these form the group of the noun or the nominal group. The immutables are: ''adverbs'', ''prepositions'', ''conjunctions'', ''particles'' and ''interjections''. Verbs and adverbs form the group of the verb or the verbal group.

===Nominal morphology===
{{Main|Bulgarian nouns}}
Nouns and adjectives have the [[grammatical category|categories]] [[grammatical gender]], [[grammatical number|number]], [[grammatical case|case]] (only [[vocative case|vocative]]) and [[definite article|definiteness]] in Bulgarian. Adjectives and adjectival pronouns agree with nouns in number and gender. Pronouns have gender and number and retain (as in nearly all [[Indo-European languages]]) a more significant part of the case system.

====Nominal inflection====
=====Gender=====
There are three grammatical genders in Bulgarian: ''masculine'', ''feminine'' and ''neuter''. The gender of the noun can largely be inferred from its ending: nouns ending in a consonant (&quot;zero ending&quot;) are generally masculine (for example, град {{IPA|/grad/}} 'city', син {{IPA|/sin/}} 'son', мъж {{IPA|/mɤʒ/}} 'man'; those ending in&amp;nbsp;–а/–я (-a/-ya) (жена {{IPA|/ʒena/}} 'woman', дъщеря {{IPA|/dɤʃterʲa/}} 'daughter', улица {{IPA|/ulitsa/}} 'street') are normally feminine; and nouns ending in&amp;nbsp;–е,&amp;nbsp;–о are almost always neuter (дете {{IPA|/dete/}} 'child', езеро {{IPA|/ezero/}} 'lake'), as are those rare words (usually loanwords) that end in&amp;nbsp;–и,&amp;nbsp;–у, and&amp;nbsp;–ю (цунами {{IPA|/tsunami/}} 'tsunami', табу {{IPA|/tabu/}} 'taboo', меню {{IPA|/meɲu/}} 'menu'). Perhaps the most significant exception from the above are the relatively numerous nouns that end in a consonant and yet are feminine: these comprise, firstly, a large group of nouns with zero ending expressing quality, degree or an abstraction, including all nouns ending on&amp;nbsp;–ост/–ест -{ost/est} (мъдрост {{IPA|/mɤdrost/}} 'wisdom', низост {{IPA|/nizost/}} 'vileness', прелест {{IPA|/prelest/}} 'loveliness', болест {{IPA|/bolest/}} 'sickness', любов {{IPA|/ʎubov/}} 'love'), and secondly, a much smaller group of irregular nouns with zero ending which define tangible objects or concepts (кръв {{IPA|/krɤv/}} 'blood', кост {{IPA|/kost/}} 'bone', вечер {{IPA|/vetʃer/}} 'evening', нoщ {{IPA|/noʃt/}} 'night').

The plural forms of the nouns do not express their gender as clearly as the singular ones, but may also provide some clues to it: the ending&amp;nbsp;–и (-i) is more likely to be used with a masculine or feminine noun (факти {{IPA/fakti/}} 'facts', болести {{IPA|/bolesti/}} 'sicknesses'), while one in&amp;nbsp;–а/–я belongs more often to a neuter noun (езера {{IPA|/ezera/}} 'lakes'). Also, the plural ending&amp;nbsp;–ове {{IPA|/-ove/}} occurs only in masculine nouns.

=====Number=====
Two numbers are distinguished in Bulgarian&amp;nbsp;— [[Grammatical number|singular]] and [[plural]]. A variety of plural suffixes is used, and the choice between them is partly determined by their ending in singular and partly influenced by gender; in addition, irregular declension and alternative plural forms are common. Words ending in&amp;nbsp;–а/–я (which are usually feminine) generally have the plural ending&amp;nbsp;–и, upon dropping of the singular ending. Of nouns ending in a consonant, the feminine ones also use&amp;nbsp;–и, whereas the masculine ones usually have&amp;nbsp;–и for polysyllables and&amp;nbsp;–ове for monosyllables (however, exceptions are especially common in this group). Nouns ending in&amp;nbsp;–о/–е (most of which are neuter) mostly use the suffixes&amp;nbsp;–а,&amp;nbsp;–я (both of which require the dropping of the singular endings) and&amp;nbsp;–та.

With [[cardinal number]]s and related words such as няколко ('several'), masculine nouns use a special count form in&amp;nbsp;–а/–я, which stems from the Proto-Slavonic [[dual grammatical number|dual]]: двама/трима ученика ('two/three students') versus тези ученици ('these students'); cf. feminine две/три/тези жени ('two/three/these women') and neuter две/три/тези деца ('two/three/these children'). However, a recently developed language norm requires that count forms should only be used with masculine nouns that do not denote persons. Thus, двама/трима ученици is perceived as more correct than двама/трима ученика, while the distinction is retained in cases such as два/три молива ('two/three pencils') versus тези моливи ('these pencils').

=====Case=====
{{See also|Bulgarian grammar#Bulgarian Case System|l1=Bulgarian grammar - Case System}}
Cases exist only in the [[personal pronoun]]s (as they do in many other modern [[Indo-European languages]]), with [[nominative case|nominative]], [[accusative case|accusative]], [[dative case|dative]] and [[vocative case|vocative]] forms. Vestiges are present in the masculine personal interrogative pronoun кой (&quot;who&quot;) and in a number of phraseological units and sayings. The major exception are [[vocative case|vocative]] forms, which are still in use for masculine (with the endings -e, -o and -ю) and feminine nouns (-[ь/й]o and -e) in the singular. However, there is a tendency to avoid them in many personal names, as the use of feminine name forms in -[ь/й]o&lt;ref name=&quot;krastev&quot;&gt;Кръстев, Боримир, 1992. Граматика за всички. Стр.61.&lt;/ref&gt; and of the potential vocative forms of foreign names has come to be considered rude or rustic. Thus, Иване means 'hey, Ivan', while the corresponding feminine forms Елено ('hey, Elena'), 
Маргарито ('hey, Margarita') are today seen as rude&lt;ref name=&quot;krastev&quot;/&gt; or, at best, unceremonious, and declining foreign names as in *Джоне ('hey, John') or *Саймъне ('hey, Simon') could only be considered humorous. Interestingly, the prohibition on constructing vocative forms for foreign names does not apply to names from [[Classical Antiquity]], with the source languages having the vocative case as well: cf Цезаре' ('Oh [[Caesar (title)|Caesar]]'), Перикле ('Oh [[Pericles]]'), Зевсе ('Oh [[Zeus]]'), etc.

'''Case remnants'''&lt;br&gt;
Some key words do retain their cases, which today are no longer considered [[nominative case|nominative]], [[accusative case|accusative]] and [[dative case|dative]], but rather as being [[grammatical subject|subject]], [[direct object]] and [[indirect object]] parts of speech:

*All personal pronouns — e.g. masculine singular:
**той, {{IPA|/tɔj/}} ('he') – него, {{IPA|/ˈnɛgo/}} ('him') – нему, {{IPA|/ˈnɛmo/}} ('to him' [archaic]).&lt;ref group=note&gt;These last two are similar to their opposites не го, {{IPA|/nɛ ˈgo/}} and не му, {{IPA|/nɛ ˈmu/}} ('not...(to) him'). The issue is similar with the feminine forms: нея, {{IPA|/ˈnɛjɐ/}} ('to her') vs. не я {{IPA|/nɛ ˈja/}} ('not...her')&lt;/ref&gt;

*The masculine interrogative pronoun кой, {{IPA|/kɔj/}} ('who') and all of its derivatives — these, however, are ''not'' declined for all masculine nouns, but only when they refer to ''men'':
** кой {{IPA|/kɔj/}} ('who') – кого {{IPA|/koˈgɔ/}} ('whom') – кому {{IPA|/koˈmu/}} ('to whom' [very rarely used]).&lt;ref group=note&gt;All of these are becoming ever rarer in modern Bulgarian, especially кому and its derivatives. Instead of this, people often say на кого {{IPA|/na kogɔ/}} or even на кой {{IPA|/na kɔj/}};  the latter even beginning to replace the former, although this usage is currently frowned upon.&lt;/ref&gt;
***the words някой {{IPA|/njakoj/}} ('someone') and никой {{IPA|/nikoj/}} ('no one') follow the same pattern as кой;
***всеки {{IPA|/vsɛki/}} ('everyone') and друг {{IPA|/druk/}} ('someone else') are similar (-иго; -иму), but extremely rare.
**the [[relative clause]]s който {{IPA|/kɔjto/}} ('who/that'), когото {{IPA|/kogɔto/}} ('whom/that') and комуто {{IPA|/komuto/}} ('to whom/that') — again, only declined when referring to men — i.e.
***човекът с '''когото''' говоря {{IPA|tʃovɛkɤt, s '''kogɔto''' govorja/}} ('the man that I'm talking to')
***столът, на '''който''' седя {{IPA|/stɔɫɐt, na '''kɔjto''' sɛdjɐ/}} ('the chair that I'm sitting on')

=====Definiteness (article)=====
In modern Bulgarian, definiteness is expressed by a [[definite article]] which is postfixed to the noun, much like in the [[Scandinavian languages]] or [[Romanian language|Romanian]] (indefinite: човек, 'person'; definite: човек'''ът''', &quot;''the'' person&quot;) or to the first nominal constituent of definite noun phrases (indefinite: добър човек, 'a good person'; definite: добри'''ят''' човек, &quot;''the'' good person&quot;). There are four singular definite articles. Again, the choice between them is largely determined by the noun's ending in the singular.&lt;ref&gt;Пашов, Петър (1999) Българска граматика. Стр.73-74.&lt;/ref&gt; Nouns that end in a consonant and are masculine use –ът/–ят, when they are [[grammatical subject]]s, and –а/–я elsewhere. Nouns that end in a consonant and are feminine, as well as nouns that end in –а/–я (most of which are feminine, too) use –та. Nouns that end in –е/–о use –то.

The plural definite article is –те for all nouns except for those, whose plural form ends in –а/–я; these get –тa instead. When postfixed to adjectives the definite articles are –ят/–я for masculine gender (again, with the longer form being reserved for grammatical subjects), –та for feminine gender, –то for neuter gender, and –те for plural.

====Adjective and numeral inflection====
Both groups agree in gender and number with the noun they are appended to. They may also take the definite article as explained above.

====Pronouns====
{{Main|Bulgarian pronouns}}
Pronouns may vary in gender, number, definiteness and are the only parts of speech that have retained case inflexions. Three cases are exhibited by some groups of pronouns — nominative, accusative and dative. The distinguishable types of pronouns include the following: personal, relative, reflexive, interrogative, negative, indefinitive, summative and possessive.

===Verbal morphology and grammar===
{{Main|Bulgarian verbs}}
According to some accounts, the Bulgarian verb can take up to 3,000{{Citation needed|date=May 2010|reason=Something more serious than the dubious statement in Pashov 1976 will be needed here}} distinct forms, as it varies in person, number, voice, aspect, mood, tense and even gender.

====Finite verbal forms====
Finite verbal forms are ''simple'' or ''compound'' and agree with subjects in person (first, second and third) and number (singular, plural) in Bulgarian. In addition to that, past compound forms using participles vary in gender (masculine, feminine, neuter) and voice (active and passive) as well as aspect (perfective/aorist and imperfective).

=====Aspect=====
Bulgarian verbs express [[lexical aspect]]: perfective verbs signify the completion of the action of the verb and form past perfective (aorist) forms; imperfective ones are neutral with regard to it and form past imperfective forms. Most Bulgarian verbs can be grouped in perfective-imperfective pairs (imperfective&lt;&gt;perfective: идвам&lt;&gt;дойда &quot;come&quot;, пристигам&lt;&gt;пристигна “arrive”). Perfective verbs can be usually formed from imperfective ones by suffixation or prefixation, but the resultant verb often deviates in meaning from the original. In the pair examples above, aspect is stem-specific and therefore there is no difference in meaning.

In Bulgarian, there is also [[grammatical aspect]]. Three grammatical aspects are distinguishable: neutral, perfect and pluperfect. The neutral aspect comprises the three simple tenses and the future tense. The pluperfect is manifest in tenses that use double or triple auxiliary &quot;be&quot; participles like the past pluperfect subjunctive. Perfect constructions use a single auxiliary &quot;be&quot;.

=====Mood=====
The traditional interpretation is that in addition to the four moods (наклонения {{IPA|/naklonenija/}}) shared by most other European languages - [[indicative mood|indicative]] (изявително, {{IPA|/izʲavitelno/}}) [[imperative mood|imperative]] (повелително {{IPA|/povelitelno/}}), [[subjunctive mood|subjunctive]] (подчинително {{IPA|/podtʃinitelno/}}) and [[conditional mood|conditional]] (условно, {{IPA|/uslovno/}}) - in Bulgarian there is one more to describe a generalistic category of unwitnessed events - the [[inferential mood|inferential]] (преизказно {{IPA|/preˈizkazno/}}) mood.

=====Tense=====
There are three grammatically distinctive positions in time — present, past and future — which combine with aspect and mood to produce a number of formations. Normally, in grammar books these formations are viewed as separate tenses — i. e. &quot;past imperfect&quot; would mean that the verb is in past tense, in the imperfective aspect, and in the indicative mood (since no other mood is shown). There are more than 40 different tenses across Bulgarian's two aspects and five  moods.

In the indicative mood, there are three simple tenses:
*''Present tense'' is a temporally unmarked simple form made up of the verbal stem and a complex suffix composed of the [[thematic vowel]] {{IPA|/e/}}, {{IPA|/i/}} or {{IPA|/a/}} and the person/number ending (пристигам, ''pristigam'', &quot;I arrive/I am arriving&quot;); only imperfective verbs can stand in the present indicative tense independently;

*''Past imperfect'' is a simple verb form used to express an action which is contemporaneous or subordinate to other past actions; it is made up of an imperfective or a perfective verbal stem and the person/number ending (пристигаx {{IPA|/pristigax/}}, пристигнеx {{IPA|/pristignex/}}, 'I was arriving');

*''Past aorist'' is a simple form used to express a temporarily independent, specific past action; it is made up of a perfective or an imperfective verbal stem and the person/number ending (пристигнах, {{IPA|/pristignax/}}, 'I arrived', четох, {{IPA|/tʃetox/}}, 'I read');

In the indicative there are also the following compound tenses:
*''Future tense'' is a compound form made of the particle ще {{IPA|/ʃte/}} and present tense (ще уча {{IPA|/ʃte utʃa/}}, 'I will study'); negation is expressed by the construction няма да {{IPA|/ɲama da/}} and present tense (няма да уча {{IPA|/ɲama da utʃa/}}, or the old-fashioned form не ще уча, {{IPA|/ne ʃte utʃa/}} 'I will not study');

*''Past future tense'' is a compound form used to express an action which was to be completed in the past but was future as regards another past action; it is made up of the past imperfect of the verb ща {{IPA|/ʃta/}} ('will'), the particle да {{IPA|/da/}} ('to') and the present tense of the verb (e.g. щях да уча, {{IPA|/ʃtʲax da utʃa/}}, 'I was going to study');

*''Present perfect'' is a compound form used to express an action which was completed in the past but is relevant for or related to the present; it is made up of the present tense of the verb съм {{IPA|/sɤm/}} ('be') and the past participle (e.g. съм учил {{IPA|/sɤm utʃil/}}, 'I have studied');

*''Past perfect'' is a compound form used to express an action which was completed in the past and is relative to another past action; it is made up of the past tense of the verb съм and the past participle (e.g. бях учил {{IPA|/bʲax utʃil/}}, 'I had studied');

*''Future perfect'' is a compound form used to express an action which is to take place in the future before another future action; it is made up of the future tense of the verb съм and the past participle (e.g. ще съм учил {{IPA|/ʃte sɤm utʃil/}}, 'I will have studied');

*''Past future perfect'' is a compound form used to express a past action which is future with respect to a past action which itself is prior to another past action; it is made up of the past imperfect of ща, the particle да the present tense of the verb съм and the past participle of the verb (e.g. щях да съм учил, {{IPA|/ʃtʲax da sɤm utʃil/}}, 'I would have studied').

The four perfect constructions above can vary in aspect depending on the aspect of the main-verb participle; they are in fact pairs of imperfective and perfective aspects. Verbs in forms using past participles also vary in voice and gender.

There is only one simple tense in the [[imperative mood]] - the present - and there are simple forms only for the second person using the suffixes -и/-й (-i, -y/i) for singular and -ете/-йте (-ete, -yte) for plural; e.g., уча {{IPA|/utʃa/}} ('to study'): уч'''и''' {{IPA|/utʃ'''i'''/}}, sg., уч'''ете''' {{IPA|/utʃ'''ete'''/}}, pl.; играя {{IPA|/igraja/}} 'to play': игра'''й''' {{IPA|/igraj/}}, игра'''йте''' {{IPA|/igra'''jte'''/}}. There are compound imperative forms for all persons and numbers in the present compound imperative (да играе, {{IPA|da igrae/}}), the present perfect compound imperative (да е играл, {{IPA|/da e igral/}}) and the rarely used present pluperfect compound imperative (да е бил играл, {{IPA|/da e bil igral/}}).

The [[conditional mood]] consists of five compound tenses, most of which are not grammatically distinguishable. The present, future and past conditional use a special past form of the stem би- (bi - &quot;be&quot;) and the past participle (бих учил, {{IPA|/bih utʃil/}}, 'I would study'). The past future conditional and the past future perfect conditional coincide in form with the respective indicative tenses.

The [[subjunctive mood]] is rarely documented as a separate verb form in Bulgarian, (being, morphologically, a sub-instance of the quasi-[[infinitive]] construction with the particle да and a normal finite verb form), but nevertheless it is used regularly. The most common form, often mistaken for the present tense, is the present subjunctive ([пo-добре] да отидa {{IPA|(po-dobre) da otida/}}, 'I had better go'). The difference between the present indicative and the present subjunctive tense is that the subjunctive can be formed by ''both'' perfective and imperfective verbs. It has completely replaced the infinitive and the supine from complex expressions (see below). It is also employed to express opinion about ''possible'' future events. The past perfect subjunctive ([пo-добре] да бях отишъл {{IPA|(po-dobre) da bʲax otiʃɤl/}}, 'I'd had better be gone') refers to ''possible'' events in the past, which ''did not'' take place, and the present pluperfect subjunctive (да съм бил отишъл {{IPA|/da sɤm bil otiʃɤl/}}), which may be used about both past and future events arousing feelings of incontinence, suspicion, etc. and has no perfect to English translation. 

The [[grammatical mood|inferential mood]] has five pure tenses. Two of them are simple - ''past aorist inferential'' and ''past imperfect inferential'' - and are formed by the past participles of perfective and imperfective verbs, respectively. There are also three compound tenses - ''past future inferential'', ''past future perfect inferential'' and ''past perfect inferential''. All these tenses' forms are gender-specific in the singular. There are also conditional and compound-imperative crossovers. The existence of inferential forms has been attributed to Turkic influences by most Bulgarian linguists. Morphologically, they are derived from the [[Bulgarian language#Tense|perfect]].

====Non-finite verbal forms====
Bulgarian has the following [[participle]]s:

*''Present active participle'' (сегашно деятелно причастие) is formed from imperfective stems with the addition of the suffixes –ащ/–ещ/–ящ (чет'''ящ''', 'reading') and is used only attributively;
*''Present passive participle'' (сегашно страдателно причастие) is formed by the addition of the suffixes -им/аем/уем (чет'''им''', 'that can be read, readable');
*''Past active aorist participle'' (минало свършено деятелно причастие) is formed by the addition of the suffix –л– to perfective stems (че'''л''', '[have] read');
*''Past active imperfect participle'' (минало несвършено деятелно причастие) is formed by the addition of the suffixes –ел/–ал/–ял to imperfective stems (чет'''ял''', '[have been] reading');
*''Past passive aorist participle''' (минало свършено страдателно причастие) is formed from aorist/perfective stems with the addition of the suffixes -н/–т (прочете'''н''', 'read'; уби'''т''', 'killed'); it is used predicatively and attributively;
*''Past passive imperfect participle''' (минало несвършено страдателно причастие) is formed from imperfective stems with the addition of the suffix –н (прочита'''н''', '[been] read'); убивa'''н''', '[been] being killed'); it is used predicatively and attributively;
*''[[Adverbial participle]]'' (деепричастие) is usually formed from imperfective present stems with the suffix –(е)йки (чете'''йки''', 'while reading'), relates an action contemporaneous with and subordinate to the main verb and is originally a Western Bulgarian form.

The participles are inflected by gender, number, and definiteness, and are coordinated with the subject when forming compound tenses (see tenses above). When used in attributive role the inflection attributes are coordinated with the noun that is being attributed.

===Adverbs===
The most [[productivity (linguistics)|productive]] way to form adverbs is to derive them from the neuter singular form of the corresponding adjective (бързо (fast), силно (hard), странно (strange), although adjectives ending in -ки use the masculine singular form, also in -ки, instead: юнашки (heroically), мъжки (bravely, like a man), майсторски (skilfully). The same pattern is used to form adverbs from the (adjective-like) ordinal numerals, e.g. първо (firstly), второ (secondly), трето (thirdly), and in some cases from (adjective-like) cardinal numerals, e.g. двойно (twice as/double), тройно (three times as), петорно (five times as).

The remaining adverbs are formed in ways that are no longer productive in the language. A small number are original (not derived from other words), for example: тук (here), там (there), вътре (inside), вън (outside), много (very/much) etc. The rest are mostly fossilized case forms, such as:
*archaic locative forms of some adjectives, e.g. добре (well), зле (badly), твърде (too, rather), and nouns горе (up), утре (tomorrow), лете (in the summer);
*archaic instrumental forms of some adjectives, e.g. тихом (quietly), скришом (furtively), слепешком (blindly), and nouns, e.g. денем (during the day), нощем (during the night), редом (one next to the other), духом (spiritually), цифром (in figures), словом (with words); or verbs: тичешком (while running), лежешком (while lying), стоешком (while standing).
*archaic accusative forms of some nouns: днес (today),нощес (tonight) сутрин (in the morning), зимъс (in winter);
*archaic genitive forms of some nouns: довечера (tonight), снощи (last night), вчера (yesterday);
*homonymous and etymologically identical to the feminine singular form of the corresponding adjective used with the definite article: здравата (hard), слепешката (gropingly); the same pattern has been applied to some verbs, e.g. тичешката (while running), лежешката (while lying), стоешката (while standing).
*derived from cardinal numerals by means of a non-productive suffix: веднъж (once), дваж (twice), триж (thrice);

Adverbs can sometimes be reduplicated to emphasize the qualitative or quantitative properties of actions, moods or relations as performed by the subject of the sentence: &quot;бавно-бавно&quot; (&quot;rather slowly&quot;), &quot;едва-едва&quot; (&quot;with great difficulty&quot;), &quot;съвсем-съвсем&quot; (&quot;quite&quot;, &quot;thoroughly&quot;).

==Lexis==
{{Main|Bulgarian lexis}}

Most of the word-stock of modern Bulgarian consists of derivations of some 2,000 words inherited from proto-Slavic through the mediation of Old and Middle Bulgarian. Thus, the native lexical terms in Bulgarian account for 70% to 75% of the lexicon.

The remaining 25% to 30% are loanwords from a number of languages, as well as derivations of such words. The languages which have contributed most to Bulgarian are [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Turkish language|Turkish]], and to a lesser extent [[French language|French]]. [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] are the source of many words, used mostly in international terminology. Many of the numerous loanwords from [[Turkish language|Turkish]] (and, via Turkish, from [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Persian language|Persian]]) which were adopted into Bulgarian during the long period of [[Ottoman empire|Ottoman]] rule, have been substituted with native terms. In addition, both specialized (usually coming from the field of [[science]]) and commonplace [[English language|English]] words (notably abstract, commodity/service-related or technical terms) have also penetrated Bulgarian since the second half of the 20th century, especially since [[1989]]. A noteworthy portion of this English-derived terminology has attained some unique features in the process of its introduction to native speakers and this has resulted in peculiar derivations that slightly set the newly-formed loanwords apart from the original words (mainly in pronunciation), although many loanwords are completely identical to the source words. A growing number of international neologisms are also being widely adopted.

==Syntax==
Bulgarian employs [[clitic doubling]], mostly for emphatic purposes. For example, the following constructions are common in colloquial Bulgarian:

:Аз (го) дадох подаръка на Мария.
:(lit. &quot;I gave ''it'' the present to Maria.&quot;)

:Аз (ѝ го) дадох подаръка на Мария.
:(lit. &quot;I gave ''her it'' the present to Maria.&quot;)

The phenomenon is practically obligatory in the spoken language in the case of inversion signalling information structure (in writing, clitic doubling may be skipped in such instances, with a somewhat bookish effect):

:Подаръка (ѝ) го дадох на Мария.
:(lit. &quot;The present [''to her''] ''it'' I-gave to Maria.&quot;)

:На Мария ѝ (го) дадох подаръка.
:(lit. &quot;To Maria ''to her'' [''it''] I-gave the present.&quot;)

Sometimes, the doubling signals syntactic relations, thus:

:Петър и Иван ги изядоха вълците.
:(lit. &quot;Petar and Ivan ''them'' ate the wolves.&quot;)
:Transl.: &quot;Petar and Ivan were eaten by the wolves&quot;.

This is contrasted with:

:Петър и Иван изядоха вълците.
:(lit. &quot;Petar and Ivan ate the wolves&quot;)
:Transl.: &quot;Petar and Ivan ate the wolves&quot;.

In this case, clitic doubling can be a colloquial alternative of the more formal or bookish passive voice, which would be constructed as follows:
:Петър и Иван бяха изядени от вълците.
:(lit. &quot;Petar and Ivan were eaten by the wolves.&quot;)

Clitic doubling is also fully obligatory, both in the spoken and in the written norm, in clauses including several special expressions that use the short accusative and dative pronouns, like играе ми се (I feel like playing), студено ми е (I am cold), боли ме ръката (my arm hurts):

:На мен ми се спи, а на Иван му се играе.
:(lit. &quot;To me ''to me'' it-feels-like-sleeping, and to Ivan ''to him'' it-feels-like-playing&quot;)
:Transl.: &quot;I feel like sleeping, and Ivan feels like playing.&quot;
:На нас ни е студено, а на вас ви е топло.
:(lit. &quot;To us ''to us'' it-is cold, and to you-plur. ''to you-plur.'' it-is warm&quot;
:Transl.: &quot;We are cold, and you are warm.&quot;
:Иван го боли гърлото, а мене ме боли главата.
:(lit. Ivan ''him'' aches the throat, and me ''me'' aches the head)
:Transl.: Ivan has sore throat, and I have a headache.

Except the above examples, clitic doubling is considered inappropriate in a formal context. Bulgarian grammars usually do not treat this phenomenon extensively.

==Other features==
===Questions===

Questions in Bulgarian which do not use a question word (such as who? what? etc.) are formed with the particle ли after the verb; a subject is not necessary, as the verbal conjugation suggests who is performing the action:
*Идваш - 'you are coming'; Идваш ли? - 'are you coming?'

While the particle ''ли'' generally goes after the verb, it can go after a noun or adjective if a contrast is needed:
*Идваш ли с нас? - 'are you coming with us?';
*С нас ли идваш? - 'are you coming with ''us''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;?
A verb is not always necessary, e.g. when presenting a choice:
*Той ли? - 'him?'; Жълтият ли? - 'the yellow one?'&lt;ref group=note&gt;The word или ('either') has a similar etymological root: и + ли ('and') - e.g. (или) Жълтият или червеният - '(either) the yellow one or the red one.' [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/или &lt;sup&gt;wiktionary&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Rhetorical questions can be formed by adding ли to a question word, thus forming a &quot;double interrogative&quot; –
*Кой? - 'Who?'; Кой ли?! - 'I wonder who(?)'
The same construction +не ('no') is an emphasised positive –
*Кой беше там? - 'Who was there?' — Кой ли не! - 'Nearly everyone!'' (lit. 'I wonder who ''wasn't'' there')

===Significant verbs===
Съм

The verb съм {{IPA|/sɤm/}}&lt;ref group=note&gt;съм is pronounced similar to English ''&quot;sum&quot;''.&lt;/ref&gt; - 'to be' is also used as an [[auxiliary verb|auxiliary]] for forming the [[perfect (grammar)|perfect]], the [[grammatical voice|passive]] and the [[conditional mood|conditional]]:
*past tense - {{IPA|/udaril sɤm/}} - 'I have hit'
*passive - {{IPA|/udaren sɤm/}} - 'I am hit'
*past passive - {{IPA|/bʲax udaren/}} - 'I was hit'
*conditional - {{IPA|/bix udaril/}} - 'I would hit'

Two alternate forms of съм exist -
*бъда {{IPA|/ˈbɤda/}} – interchangeable with съм in most tenses and moods, but never in the [[present indicative]] - e.g. {{IPA|/iskam da bɤda/}} ('I want to be'), {{IPA|/ʃte bɤda tuk/}} ('I will be here'); in the imperative, only бъда is used – {{IPA|/bɤda tuk/}} ('be here');
*бивам {{IPA|/ˈbivam/}} – slightly archaic, imperfective form of бъда - e.g. {{IPA|/bivaʃe zaplaʃen/}} ('he used to get threats'); in contemporary usage, it is mostly used in the negative to mean &quot;ought not&quot;, e.g. {{IPA|/ne biva da puʃiʃ/}} ('you shouldn't smoke').&lt;ref group=note&gt;It is a common reply to the question Kak e?'' 'How are things?' (lit. 'how is it?') – {{IPA|/biva/}} 'alright' (lit. 'it [repetitively] is') or {{IPA|/kak si/}} 'How are you?' -{{IPA|/ˈbivam/}} 'I'm OK'.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ще

The impersonal verb щe (lit. 'it wants')&lt;ref group=note&gt;ще - from the verb щa - 'to want.' The present tense of this verb in the sense of 'to want' is archaic and only used colloquially. Instead, искам {{IPA|/iskam/}} is used.&lt;/ref&gt; is used to for forming the (positive) future tense:
*{{IPA|/otivam/}} - 'I am going'
*{{IPA|/ʃte otivam/}} - 'I will be going'
The negative future is formed with the invariable construction няма да {{IPA|/ɲama da/}} (see няма below) &lt;ref group=note&gt;Formed from the impersonal verb няма  (lit. 'it does not have') and the subjunctive particle да {{IPA|/da/}} ('that')&lt;/ref&gt; :
*{{IPA|/ɲama da otivam/}} - 'I will not be going'
The past tense of this verb – щях {{IPA|/ʃtʲax/}} is conjugated to form the past conditional ('would have' - again, with да, since it is ''[[irrealis]]''):
*{{IPA|/ʃtʲax da otida/}} - 'I would have gone;' {{IPA|/ʃteshe da otideʃ/}} 'you would have gone'

Имам and нямам

The verbs имам {{IPA|/imam/}} ('to have') and нямам {{IPA|/ɲamam/}} ('to not have') -
*the third person singular of these two can be used impersonally to mean 'there is/there are' or 'there isn't/aren't any,'&lt;ref group=note&gt;They can also be used on their own as a reply, with no object following: има - 'there are some'; {{IPA|/ɲama/}} - 'there aren't any' - compare German ''keine''.&lt;/ref&gt;  e.g. -
**{{IPA|/ima vreme/}} ('there is still time' - compare Spanish ''hay'');
**{{IPA|/ɲama nikoj/}} ('there is no one there').
*The impersonal form няма is used in the negative future - (see ще above).
**имама used on its own can mean simply 'I won't' - a simple refusal to a suggestion or instruction.

===Diminutives and augmentatives===
'''Diminutive'''
{{See also|Diminutive#Bulgarian}}

Usually done by adding -че, -це or -(ч)ка. The gender of the word is thus changed, usually to the neuter:
*{{IPA|/koˈla/}} ('car') → {{IPA|/koˈlitʃka/}} ('baby's buggy')
*{{IPA|/kotka}} or {{IPA|/kote/}} ('cat') → {{IPA|/kotentse/}} ('kitten')

:'''Affectionate Form'''

Sometimes [[proper noun]]s and words referring to friends or family members can have a diminutive ending added to show affection. These constructions are all referred to as ''&quot;na galeno&quot;'' (lit. &quot;caressing&quot; form):
*''mayka'' (mother) → ''maychitse''; ''tatko'' (father) → ''tatentse''
Such words can be used ''both'' from parent to child, and vice-versa, as can -
*''batko'' (big brother) → ''batentse''; ''priyatel'' (friend) → ''priyatelche''.

Personal names are shortened and made neuter:
*Georgi → Gosho/Gotse, Mihail → Misho, Angel → Gele/Acho, Ivan → Vanko, Vasil → Vasko
*Anna → Ani, Irina → Reni

There is an interesting trend (which is comparatively modern, although it might well have deeper, dormant roots) where the feminine ending &quot;'''''-ka'''''&quot; and the definite article suffix &quot;'''''-ta'''''&quot; (&quot;the&quot;) are added to male names – note that this is affectionate and not at all insulting (in fact, the endings are not even really considered as being &quot;feminine&quot;):
*Ivan → Vànkata, Acho → Àchkata.

The female equivalent would be to add the neuter ending &quot;'''''-to'''''&quot; to the diminutive form:
*Nadia → Nadeto, Sonia → Soncheto

'''Augmentative'''

This is to present words to sound larger - usually by adding &quot;'''''-shte'''''&quot;:
*''chovek'' (person) → ''chovech'''ishte''''' (huge person) (note the root change ''k→ch'')
Some words only exist in an augmentative form - e.g.
*''zrelishte'' &quot;(awesome) spectacle&quot; (from the old Slavic root &quot;to see&quot;)
*''svlachishte'' &quot;landslide&quot; - from ''svlicham'' &quot;to drag down&quot;

===Conjunctions and particles===

:'''''&quot;But&quot;'''''

In Bulgarian, there are several conjunctions all translating into English as &quot;but&quot;, which are all used in distinct situations. They are '''''но''' (no), '''ама''' (amà), '''а''' (a), '''ами''' (amì)'', and '''''ала''' (alà)'' (and ''обаче (obache)'' — &quot;however&quot;, identical in use to ''но'').

While there is some overlapping between their uses, in many cases they are specific. For example, '''''ami''''' is used for a choice — ''ne tova, ami onova'' — &quot;not this one, but that one&quot; (comp. Spanish ''sino''), while '''''ama''''' is often used to provide extra information or an opinion — ''kazah go, ama sgreshih'' — &quot;I said it, but I was wrong&quot;. Meanwhile, '''''a''''' provides contrast between two situations, and in some sentences can even be translated as &quot;although&quot;, &quot;while&quot; or even &quot;and&quot; — ''az rabotya, a toy blee'' — &quot;I'm working, and he's daydreaming&quot;.

Very often, different words can be used to alter the emphasis of a sentence — e.g. while ''&quot;pusha, no ne tryabva&quot;'' and ''&quot;pusha, a ne tryabva&quot;'' both mean &quot;I smoke, but I shouldn't&quot;, the first sounds more like a statement of fact (&quot;...but I mustn't&quot;), while the second feels more like a ''judgement'' (&quot;...but I oughtn't&quot;). Similarly, ''az ne iskam, ama toy iska'' and ''az ne iskam, a toy iska'' both mean &quot;I don't want to, but he does&quot;, however the first emphasises the fact that ''he'' wants to, while the second emphaseses the ''wanting'' rather than the person.

''Ala'' is interesting in that, while it feels archaic, it is often used in poetry and frequently in children's stories, since it has quite a moral/ominous feel to it.

Some common expressions use these words, and some can be used alone as interjections:
*''da, ama ne'' (lit. &quot;yes, but no&quot;) — means &quot;you're wrong to think so&quot;.
*''ama'' can be tagged onto a sentence to express surprise: ''ama toy spi!'' — &quot;he's sleeping!&quot;
*''ами!'' — &quot;you don't say!&quot;, &quot;really!&quot;

''' Vocative particles '''

Bulgarian has several abstract particles which are used to strengthen a statement. These have no precise translation in English.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Perhaps most similar in use is the tag &quot;man&quot;, but the Bulgarian particles are more abstract still.&lt;/ref&gt; The particles are strictly informal and can even be considered rude by some people and in some situations. They are mostly used at the end of questions or instructions.

*''бе (be)'' - the most common particle. It can be used to strengthen a statement or, sometimes, to indicate derision of an opinion, aided by the tone of voice. (Originally purely masculine, it can now be used towards both men and women.)
**''kazhi mi, be'' - tell me (insistence); ''taka li, be?'' - is that so? (derisive); ''vyarno li, be?'' - you don't say!.
*''де (de)'' - expresses urgency, sometimes pleading.
**''stavay, de!'' - come on, get up!
*''ма (ma)'' (feminine only) - originally simply the feminine counterpart of ''be'', but today perceived as rude and derisive (compare the similar evolution of the vocative forms of feminine names).
*''бре (bre, masculine)'', ''мари(mari, feminine)'' - similar to ''be'' and ''ma'', but archaic. Although informal, can sometimes be heard being used by older people.

'''Modal Particles'''

These are &quot;tagged&quot; on to the beginning or end of a sentence to express the mood of the speaker in relation to the situation. They are mostly [[interrogative]] or slightly [[imperative mood|imperative]] in nature. There is no change in the grammatical mood when these are used (although they may be expressed through different grammatical moods in other languages).

*''нали (nalì)'' – is a universal affirmative tag, like &quot;isn't it&quot;/&quot;won't you&quot;, etc. (it is invariable, like the French ''n'est-ce pas''). It can be placed almost anywhere in the sentence, and does not always require a verb:
**''shte doydesh, nali?'' - you are coming, aren't you?; ''nali iskaha?'' - didn't they want to?; ''nali onzi?'' - that one, right?;
**it can express quite complex thoughts through simple constructions - ''nali nyamashe?'' - &quot;I thought you weren't going to!&quot; or &quot;I thought there weren't any!&quot; (depending on context - the verb ''nyama'' presents general negation/lacking, see &quot;nyama&quot;, above).

*''дали (dalì)'' – expresses uncertainty (if in the middle of a clause, can be translated as &quot;whether&quot;) - e.g. ''dali shte doyde?'' - &quot;do you think he will come?&quot;

*''нима (nimà)'' – presents disbelief ~&quot;don't tell me that...&quot; - e.g. ''nima iskash?!'' - &quot;don't tell me you want to!&quot;. It is slightly archaic, but still in use. Can be used on its own as an [[interjection]] - ''nima!''

*''дано (danò)'' – expresses hope - ''shte doyde'' - &quot;he will come&quot;; ''dano doyde'' - &quot;I hope he comes&quot; (comp. Spanish ''ojalá''). Grammatically, ''dano'' is entirely separate from the verb ''nadyavam se'' - &quot;to hope&quot;.

*''нека (nèka)'' – means &quot;let('s)&quot; - e.g. ''neka doyde'' - &quot;let him come&quot;; when used in the first person, it expresses extreme politeness: ''neka da otidem...'' - &quot;let us go&quot; (in colloquial situations, ''haide'', below, is used instead).
**''neka'', as an interjection, can also be used to express judgement or even ''[[Schadenfreude]]'' - ''neka mu!'' - &quot;he deserves it!&quot;.

''' Intentional particles '''

These express intent or desire, perhaps even pleading. They can be seen as a sort of [[cohortative mood|cohortative]] side to the language. (Since they can be used by themselves, they could even be considered as verbs in their own right.) They are also highly informal.
*''хайде (hàide)'' - &quot;come on&quot;, &quot;let's&quot;
**e.g. ''haide, po-burzo'' - &quot;faster!&quot;
*''я (ya)'' - &quot;let me&quot; - exclusively when asking someone else for something. It can even be used on its own as a request or instruction (depending on the tone used), indicating that the speaker wants to partake in or try whatever the listener is doing.
**''ya da vidya'' - let me see; ''ya?'' or ''ya!'' - &quot;let me.../give me...&quot;

*''недей (nedèi)'' (plur. ''nedèyte'') – can be used to issue a negative instruction - e.g. ''nedey da idvash'' - &quot;don't come&quot; (''nedey'' + subjunctive). In some dialects, the construction ''nedey idva'' (''nedey'' + preterite) is used instead. As an interjection – ''nedei!'' - &quot;don't!&quot; (See section on [[Bulgarian grammar#Mood|imperative mood]]).

These particles can be combined with the vocative particles for greater effect, e.g. ''ya da vidya, be'' (let me see), or even exclusively in combinations with them, with no other elements, e.g. ''haide, de!'' (come on!); ''nedey, de!'' (I told you not to!).

===Pronouns of Quality===

Bulgarian has several pronouns of quality which have no direct parallels in English — ''kakuv'' (what sort of); ''takuv'' (this sort of); ''onakuv'' (that sort of — colloq.); ''nyakakuv'' (some sort of); ''nikakuv'' (no sort of); ''vsyakakuv'' (every sort of); and the relative pronoun ''kakuvto'' (the sort of...that...). The adjective ''ednakuv'' (&quot;the same&quot;) derives from the same radical.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Like the [[demonstrative pronoun|demonstratives]], these take the same form as pronouns as they do as adjectives — ie. ''takuv'' means both &quot;this kind of...&quot; (adj.) and ''this kind of person/thing'' (pron., depending on the context).&lt;/ref&gt;

Example phrases include:
*''kakuv chovek?!'' — &quot;what person?!&quot;; ''kakuv chovek e toy?'' — what sort of person is he?
*''ne poznavam takuv'' — &quot;I don't know any (people like that)&quot; (lit. &quot;I don't know this sort of (person)&quot;)
*''nyakakvi hora'' — lit. &quot;some type of people&quot;, but the understood meaning is &quot;a bunch of people I don't know&quot;
*''vsyakakvi hora'' — &quot;all sorts of people&quot;
*''kakuv iskash?'' — &quot;which type do you want?&quot;; ''nikakuv!'' — &quot;I don't want any!&quot;/&quot;none!&quot;

An interesting phenomenon is that these can be strung along one after another in quite long constructions, e.g. -

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! word
! literal meaning
! sentence
! meaning of sentence as a whole
|-
| -
| -
| edna kola
| a car
|-
| takava

| edna '''takava''' kola...
| this car '''(that i'm trying to describe)'''
|-
| nikakva
| no sort of
| edna takava '''nikakva''' kola
| this '''worthless''' car (that i'm trying to describe)
|-
| nyakakva
| some sort of
| edna takava '''nyakakva''' nikakva kola
| this '''sort of''' worthless car (that I'm trying to describe)
|}
An extreme (colloquial) sentence, with almost no ''physical'' meaning in it whatsoever — yet which ''does'' have perfect meaning to the Bulgarian ear — would be :
*&quot;kakva e taya takava edna nyakva nikva?!&quot;
*inferred translation — &quot;what kind of no-good person is she?&quot;
*literal translation: &quot;what kind of — is — this one here (she) — this sort of — one — some sort of — no sort of&quot;
— Note: the subject of the sentence is simply the pronoun &quot;taya&quot; (lit. &quot;this one here&quot;; colloq. - &quot;she&quot;).

Similar &quot;meaningless&quot; expressions are extremely common in spoken Bulgarian, especially when the speaker is finding it difficult to describe something.

===Miscellaneous===
*The commonly-cited phenomenon of Bulgarian people shaking their head for &quot;yes&quot; and nodding for &quot;no&quot; is true but, with the influence of Western culture, ever rarer, and almost non-existent among the younger generation. (It should be noted, however, that the shaking and nodding are ''not'' identical to the Western gestures. The &quot;nod&quot; for ''no'' is actually an ''upward'' movement of the head rather than a downward one, while the shaking of the head for ''yes'' is not completely horizontal, but also has a slight &quot;wavy&quot; aspect to it.)
**A [[dental click]] {{IPA|[ǀ]}} (similar to the English &quot;tsk&quot;) also means &quot;no&quot; (informal), as does ''ъ-ъ'' {{IPA|[ʔə-ʔə]}} (the only occurrence in Bulgarian of the [[glottal stop]]). The two are often said with the upward 'nod'.

*Bulgarian has an extensive vocabulary covering [[Kinship terminology|family relationships]]. The biggest range of words is for uncles and aunts – e.g. ''chicho'' (your father's brother), ''vuicho'' (your mother's brother), svako (your aunt's husband); an even larger amount of synonyms for these three exists in the various dialects of Bulgarian, including ''kaleko, lelincho, tetin'', etc. The words do not only refer to the closest members of the family (such as ''brat'' - brother, but ''batko''/''bate'' - older brother, ''sestra'' - sister, but ''kaka'' - older sister), but extend to its furthest reaches, e.g. ''badzhanak'' from [[Old Bulgarian]] ''pashenog'' (the relationship of the husbands of two sisters to each other) and ''etarva'' (the relationships of two brothers' wives to each other). For all in-laws, there are specific names, e.g. a woman's husband's brother is her ''dever'' and his husband's sister is her ''zalva''. In the traditional rural extended family before 1900, there existed separate subcategories for different brothers-in-law/sisters-in-law of a woman with regard to their age relative to hers, e.g. instead of simply a ''dever'' there could be a ''braino'' (older), a ''draginko'' (younger), or an ''ubavenkyo'' (who is still a child).

*As with many Slavic languages, the double negative in Bulgarian is grammatically correct, while some forms of it, when used instead of a single negative form, are grammatically incorrect. The following are literal translations of grammatically correct Bulgarian sentences that utilize a double or multiple negation: &quot;Никой никъде никога нищо не е направил.&quot; (multiple negation without the use of a compound double negative form, i.e. using a listing of several successive single negation words) - &quot;Nobody never nowhere nothing did not do.&quot; (translated as &quot;nobody has ever done anything, anywhere&quot;); &quot;Никога не съм бил там.&quot; (double negation without the use of a compound double negative form, i.e. using a listing of several successive single negation words) - I did not there never go  (&quot;[I] have never been there&quot;); Никога никакви чувства не съм имал! - I have not never had no feelings!  (I have never had any feelings!). The same applies for Macedonian.

==Common expressions==
*Здравей (zdravéy) — Hello
*Здрасти (zdrásti) — Hi &lt;ref group=note&gt;This is a more informal form of Здравей In polite conversation, the &quot;Vi&quot; form is used by both parties: ''zdraveyte''.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Добро утро (dobró útro) — Good morning
*Добър ден (dóbər dén) — Good day
*Добър вечер (dóbər vécher) — Good evening
*Лека нощ (léka nósht) — Good night
*Довиждане (dovízhdane) — Good-bye

*Кой сте вие? (kóy ste víe) ''[formal, masculine]''
*Коя сте вие? (kоyá ste víe) ''[formal, feminine]'' — Who are you?
(In the above two examples, the formal expression uses a plural verb but a singular pronoun, which allows speakers to distinguish the two grammatical forms.)
*Кои сте вие? (kоí ste víe) ''[plural form]'' — Who are you?
*Как си? (kák si) ''[informal]'' — How are you?

An ''n''-gonal '''bipyramid''' or '''dipyramid''' is a [[polyhedron]] formed by joining an ''n''-gonal [[Pyramid (geometry)|pyramid]] and its [[mirror image]] base-to-base. 

The referenced ''n''-gon in the name of the bipyramids is not an external face but an internal one, existing on the primary symmetry plane which connects the two pyramid halves.

The [[face-transitive]] bipyramids are the [[dual polyhedron|dual polyhedra]] of the [[Prism (geometry)|uniform prisms]] and will generally have [[isosceles triangle]] faces.

A bipyramid can be [[Perspective projection|projected]] on a sphere or [[globe]] as ''n'' equally spaced lines of [[longitude]] going from [[Geographical pole|pole]] to pole, and [[Bisection|bisected]] by a line around the [[equator]].

Bipyramid [[face (geometry)|face]]s, projected as [[spherical triangle]]s, represent the fundamental domains in the [[List of spherical symmetry groups#Dihedral|dihedral symmetry]] D&lt;SUB&gt;nh&lt;/SUB&gt;.

== Volume ==
The [[volume]] of a bipyramid is &lt;math&gt;V = \frac{2}{3} Bh&lt;/math&gt; where ''B'' is the area of the base and ''h'' the height from the base to the apex.  This works for any location of the apex, provided that ''h'' is measured as the [[perpendicular]] distance from the [[plane (geometry)|plane]] which contains the base.

The volume of a bipyramid whose base is a regular ''n''-sided [[polygon]] with side length ''s'' and whose height is ''h'' is therefore:
 
:&lt;math&gt;V = \frac{n}{6}hs^2 \cot\frac{\pi}{n}&lt;/math&gt;

== Equilateral triangle bipyramids ==

Only three kinds of bipyramids can have all edges of the same length (which implies that all faces are [[equilateral triangle]]s, and thus the bipyramid is a [[deltahedron]]): the [[Triangular dipyramid|triangular]], tetragonal, and [[Pentagonal dipyramid|pentagonal]] bipyramids. The tetragonal bipyramid with identical edges, or [[regular octahedron]], counts among the [[Platonic solid]]s, while the triangular and pentagonal bipyramids with identical edges count among the [[Johnson solid]]s (J12 and J13).

== Forms ==

# ''Square bipyramid'' (the [[regular octahedron]] is a special case) - 8 faces - dual [[cube]]

|}

== Symmetry groups ==
If the base is regular and the line through the [[Apex (geometry)|apexes]] intersects the base at its center, the [[List of spherical symmetry groups|symmetry group]] of the ''n''-agonal bipyramid has [[Dihedral symmetry in three dimensions|dihedral symmetry]] ''D&lt;sub&gt;nh&lt;/sub&gt;'' of order 4''n'', except in the case of a regular octahedron, which has the larger [[octahedral symmetry]] group '''O&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;''' of order 48, which has three versions of ''D&lt;sub&gt;4h&lt;/sub&gt;'' as subgroups.
The [[rotation group]] is ''D&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' of order 2''n'', except in the case of a regular octahedron, which has the larger symmetry group '''O''' of order 24, which has three versions of ''D''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; as subgroups.

== Star bipyramids ==

Self-intersecting bipyramids exist with a [[star polygon]] central figure, defined by triangular faces connecting each polygon edge to these two points.

For example, a '''pentagrammic dipyramid''' is an isohedral [[star polyhedron]] composed of 10 intersecting isoceles triangles. It is the [[dual polyhedron|dual]] to the [[pentagrammic prism]].
:[[Image:Pentagram Dipyramid.png|240px]]

== Higher dimensions ==

In general, a ''bipyramid'' can be seen as an ''n''-[[polytope]] constructed with a ''(n-1)''-polytope in a [[hyperplane]] with two points in opposite directions, equal distance perpendicular from the hyperplane. If the (n-1)-polytope is a regular polytope, it will have identical [[Pyramid (geometry)|pyramids]] [[Facet (geometry)|facets]].

The '''Beast of Bodmin''', also styled The '''Beast of Bodmin Moor'''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nhm.ac.uk/nature-online/life/mammals/beast-of-bodmin-moor/&lt;/ref&gt; like The [[Beast of Exmoor]], is a [[Phantom cat|phantom wild cat]] which is purported to range in [[Cornwall]] in the [[United Kingdom]].  [[Bodmin Moor]] became a centre of these sightings with occasional reports of mutilated slain [[livestock]]: the alleged [[Leopard|panther]]-like cats of the same region came to be popularly known as the Beast of Bodmin Moor.

In general, scientists reject such claims because of the improbably large numbers necessary to maintain a breeding population&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.clara.net/rfthomas/news/bfhunting.html Bigfoot hunting&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and because climate and food supply issues would make such purported creatures' survival in reported habitats unlikely.&lt;ref&gt;Sjögren, Bengt, ''Berömda vidunder'', Settern, 1980, ISBN 91-7586-023-6 {{sv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such sightings and stories may simply be a more modern manifestation of earlier stories of mythical '[[Black dog (ghost)|Black Dogs]] and other such creatures in remote areas of Britain, such as those which inspired [[The Hound of the Baskervilles]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.birdsofbritain.co.uk/british-mammals/big-cats.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigation==
A long held hypothesis suggests the possibility that [[alien big cats]] at large in the [[United Kingdom]] could have been imported as part of private collections or zoos, later escaped or set free.  An escaped big cat could not be reported to the authorities due to the illegality of owning and importing the animals.

The [[Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food]] conducted an official investigation in 1995. The study found that there was &quot;no verifiable evidence&quot; of exotic felines loose in Britain, and that the mauled farm animals could have been attacked by common indigenous species. The report stated that &quot;the investigation could not prove that a 'big cat' is not present.&quot;

===Skull===

Less than a week after the government report, a boy was walking by the [[River Fowey]] when he discovered a large cat skull. Measuring about four inches wide and seven inches long (10 × 18&amp;nbsp;cm), the skull was minus its lower jaw but possessed two sharp, prominent canines that suggested that it might have been a leopard. The story hit the national press at about the same time of the official denial of alien big cat evidence on Bodmin Moor.

The skull was sent to the [[Natural History Museum]] in [[London]] for verification. They determined that it was a genuine skull from a young male leopard, but also found that the cat had not died in Britain and that the skull had been imported as part of a leopard-skin rug. The back of the skull was cleanly cut off in a way that is commonly used to mount the head on a rug. There was an egg case inside the skull that had been laid by a tropical cockroach that could not possibly be found in Britain. There were also cut marks on the skull indicating the flesh had been scraped off with a knife, and the skull had begun to decompose only after a recent submersion in water.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nhm.ac.uk/nature-online/life/mammals/beast-of-bodmin-moor/bm_01.htm The Beast of Bodmin Moor], [[Natural History Museum]], [[London]].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Brown University''' is a [[private university|private]], [[Ivy League]] [[university]] located in [[Providence, Rhode Island]], United States. Founded in 1764 prior to [[American independence]] from the [[British Empire]] as the ''College in the English Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations'' early in the reign of [[King George III]] (1760–1820), Brown is the third oldest institution of higher education in [[New England]] and [[Colonial Colleges|seventh oldest]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brown.edu/Administration/News_Bureau/Databases/Encyclopedia/search.php?serial=B0180 |title=Encyclopedia Brunoniana &amp;#124; Bicentennial celebration |publisher=Brown University |accessdate=9 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several of the buildings on the Brown campus from its founding 18th century period through the 20th century offer fine representation of the [[Georgian architecture|Georgian style]] of American colonial era architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brown.edu/Administration/News_Bureau/Databases/Encyclopedia/search.php?serial=C0060
|title=Encyclopedia Brunoniana; Campus |publisher=Brown University |accessdate=21 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Brown was the first college in the nation to accept students regardless of religious affiliation.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |url=http://www.brown.edu/Administration/Admission/gettoknowus/ourhistory.html |title=Get to Know Us: Our History |publisher= Brown University Admission Office}}&lt;/ref&gt; Academically, Brown consists of [[The College of Brown University|The College]], [[Graduate School of Brown University|Graduate School]], [[Alpert Medical School]], and the [[Brown University School of Engineering|School of Engineering]]. Brown's international programs are organized through the [[Watson Institute for International Studies]]. The New Curriculum, instituted in 1969, eliminated distribution requirements and allows any course to be taken on a satisfactory/no credit basis. In addition, there are no pluses or minuses in the letter grading system. The school has the oldest undergraduate [[engineering]] program in the Ivy League (1847). [[Pembroke College (Brown University)|Pembroke College]], Brown's women's college, merged with the university in 1971. While Brown is considered a small research university with 689 full-time faculty and 2,000 graduate students, five of its professors and two of its alumni have been honored as [[Nobel Laureates]]. The faculty added 100 new professors in the past 10 years under the Boldly Brown campaign.

Completed concentrations of undergraduates by area are Social Sciences (42%), Humanities (26%), Life Sciences (17%), and the Physical Sciences (14%).&lt;ref name=&quot;brown.edu&quot;&gt;http://www.brown.edu/Administration/Institutional_Research/documents/QuickReference09-10.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 

Brown's main campus is located on [[College Hill, Providence, Rhode Island|College Hill]] on the [[East Side of Providence]]. The university's 37 varsity athletic teams are known as the [[Brown Bears]]. The school colors are [[seal brown]], [[cardinal (color)|cardinal red]], and white. Brown's [[mascot]] is the [[bear]], which dates back to 1904.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, Martha. (1993). &quot;[http://www.brown.edu/Administration/News_Bureau/Databases/Encyclopedia/search.php?serial=B0130 Bear].&quot; ''Encyclopedia Brunoniana''&lt;/ref&gt; The costumed mascot named &quot;Bruno&quot; frequently makes appearances at athletic games. People associated with the University are known as [[List of Brown University people|Brunonians]].

Serving since 2001 as Brown's 18th president, [[Ruth Simmons|Ruth J. Simmons]] is the first permanent female president of the university. She is also the first [[African American]] and second female president of an [[List of Ivy League university presidents|Ivy League]] institution.

{{Main|History of Brown University}}

===Founding of Brown===
[[Image:James Manning head by Cosmo Alexander.JPG‎|thumb|left|First Brown President and Delegate to the [[Congress of the Confederation]] [[James Manning (minister)|James Manning]]. Detail from an oil painting by Cosmo Alexander, 1770; in University Hall, Brown University, Providence, R.I.]]
[[Image:BrownUniversity-UniversityHall1795.jpg|thumb|This copper-plate engraving from 1795 is the first known image of Brown. The original campus was a single academic building that was later named [[University Hall (Brown University)|University Hall]].]]

Brown owes its founding to the support of learning among a [[Baptist]] Church association but in 1762, the Baptist Minister [[Morgan Edwards]] was at first ridiculed for suggesting the founding of a college. In his ''Materials for a History of the Baptists in Rhode Island'', Edwards wrote:
&quot;The first mover [Edwards, himself] for it [a Baptist college] in 1762 was laughed at as a projector of a thing impracticable. Nay, many of the Baptists themselves discouraged the design (prophesying evil to the churches in case it should take place) from an unhappy prejudice against learning.&quot;[http://www.brown.edu/Facilities/University_Library/exhibits/education/founding.html]

This did not stop them. In 1763, The Reverend [[James Manning (Minister)|James Manning]], a [[Baptist]] minister and an alumnus of the [[Princeton University|College of New Jersey]] (predecessor to today's [[Princeton University]]), was sent to Rhode Island by the Philadelphia Association of Baptist Churches in order to found a college.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

At the same time, local [[Congregational church|Congregationalists]], led by future [[Yale College]] president [[Ezra Stiles]], were working toward a similar end. The inaugural board meeting of the Corporation of the College in the English [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations|Colony of Rhode Island &amp; Providence Plantations]] was held in the [[Old Colony House]] in [[Newport, Rhode Island]]. Former [[List of colonial governors of Rhode Island|Royal Governors of Rhode Island]] under King George III [[Stephen Hopkins (politician)|Stephen Hopkins]] and [[Samuel Ward (American statesman)|Samuel Ward]] as well as the Reverend [[Isaac Backus]] and the Reverend [[Samuel Stillman]] were among those who played an instrumental role in Brown's foundation and later became American revolutionaries. On March 3, 1764, a charter was filed to create the College in [[Warren, Rhode Island]], reflecting the work of both Stiles and Manning. The [http://www.brown.edu/Facilities/University_Library/exhibits/education/charter.html university charter] was executed under the authority of [[King George III]].

The charter had more than sixty signatories, including the brothers [[John Brown (Rhode Island)|John]], [[Nicholas Brown (Brown University)|Nicholas]] and [[Moses Brown|Moses]] of the [[Chad Brown (minister)|Brown]] family, who would later inspire the College's modern name following a gift bestowed by [[Nicholas Brown (Brown University)|Nicholas Brown, Jr.]] The college's mission, the charter stated, was to prepare students &quot;for discharging the Offices of Life with usefulness &amp; reputation&quot; by providing instruction &quot;in the Vernacular and Learned Languages, and in the liberal Arts and Sciences.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|author=Brunson, Walter C.
|title=The History of Brown University, 1764–1914
|year=1972
|page=500 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1764, Edwards joined several others as an original fellow or trustee for the chartering of the College in the English Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations (the former name for Brown University), the first Baptist college in the original [[thirteen colonies]] and one of the [[Ivy League]] universities.[http://www.brown.edu/Administration/Corporation/downloads/charter-of-brown-university.pdf]

The charter required that the makeup of the board of 36 trustees include 22 [[Baptists]], five [[Religious Society of Friends|Friends]], four [[Congregational church|Congregationalists]], and five [[Church of England|Church of England members]], and by 12 Fellows, of whom eight, including the President, should be Baptists &quot;and the rest indifferently of any or all denominations.&quot; It specified that &quot;into this liberal and catholic institution shall never be admitted any religious tests, but on the contrary, all the members hereof shall forever enjoy full, free, absolute, and uninterrupted liberty of conscience.&quot; One of the Baptist founders, [[John Gano]], had also been the founding minister of the [[First Baptist Church in the City of New York]]. The [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition]] remarks that &quot;At the time it was framed the charter was considered extraordinarily [[liberalism|liberal]]&quot; and that &quot;the government has always been largely non-sectarian in spirit.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://encyclopedia.jrank.org/PRE_PYR/PROVIDENCE.html Providence].&quot; ''Encyclopædia Britannica''. 1911. 11th edition. Vol 22 (POL-RHE). p. 511c: (Makeup of board, 22 Baptists, etc. No religious tests for admission. &quot;Considered extraordinary liberal.&quot;)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Comment placed outside reference, as comments cause errors with cite.php.

[[Image:BrownUniversity-Campus1908.png|thumb|left|Watercolor painting by Richard Rummell from that depicts an aerial view of campus in 1908. Although the [[John Hay Library]] had not yet been built, the design had been approved so the artist included it.]]

James Manning was sworn in as the College's first president in 1765. His tenure ended in 1791. During his tenure, the College moved to its present location on [[College Hill, Providence, Rhode Island|College Hill]] in the East Side of Providence in 1770 and construction of the first building, the College Edifice, began. This building was renamed University Hall in 1823.
[[File:brown univeristy manning hall 2009v.jpg|thumb|Hope College (left) was built in 1822, while Manning Hall (right) was built in 1834.]]
The Brown family&amp;nbsp;— [[Nicholas Brown (Brown University)|Nicholas Sr.]], [[John Brown (Rhode Island)|John]], Joseph, and [[Moses Brown|Moses]],— were instrumental in the move to Providence, funding and organizing much of the construction of the new buildings on the former [[Chad Brown (minister)|Rev. Chad Brown]] farm. The family's connection with the college was strong: Joseph Brown became a professor of Physics at the University, and John Brown served as treasurer from 1775 to 1796. In 1804, a year after John Brown's death, the University was renamed Brown University in honor of John's nephew, [[Nicholas Brown, Jr.]], who was a member of the class of 1786 and in 1804 contributed $5,000 toward an endowed professorship. In 1904, the [[John Carter Brown Library]] was opened as a research center on Americas based on the libraries of [[John Carter Brown]] and his son John Nicholas Brown.

The Brown family was involved in various business ventures in Rhode Island, and made a small part of its wealth in businesses related to the [[History of slavery|slave trade]]. The family itself was divided on the issue. John Brown had unapologetically defended slavery, while Moses Brown and Nicholas Brown Jr. were fervent [[abolitionism|abolitionists]]. In recognition of this complex history, under President [[Ruth Simmons]], the University established the University Steering Committee on Slavery and Justice in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= Howell, Ricardo |year= 2001 |month= July |url= http://www.brown.edu/Administration/News_Bureau/Info/Slavery.html |title= Slavery, the Brown Family of Providence and Brown University |publisher= Brown University News Service |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080409001105/http://www.brown.edu/Administration/News_Bureau/Info/Slavery.html |archivedate= 9 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several of the original organizers and founding trustees and fellows of Brown listed in the section concerning the formation of Brown's founding charter were prominent business figures, religious figures or statesmen in the original 13 colonies or in Rhode Island, particularly during the [[American Revolutionary period]]. Their individual lives reflect the historical currents that prevailed during a period of historic transition for the American colonies and for the rise of [[liberal democracy|democratic governance]] as the colonies moved from legal integration within the British Empire to full fledged American independence.

Brown began to admit women when it established a [[Women's College in Brown University]] in 1891, which was later named [[Pembroke College in Brown University]]. &quot;The College&quot; (the undergraduate school) merged with Pembroke College in 1971 and became co-educational.

The language of the Brown University charter has long been interpreted by the university as discouraging the founding of a [[business school]] or [[law school]]. Brown continues to be one of only two Ivy League colleges with neither a business school nor a law school (the other being Princeton).

===American Revolution===

{{Portal box|British Empire}}
[[Stephen Hopkins (politician)|Stephen Hopkins]], Chief Justice and [[Governor]] of the ''English Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations'', was later a Delegate to the [[Albany Congress|Colonial Congress in Albany]] in 1754 and to the [[Continental Congress]] from 1774 to 1776. He was a signatory to the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] on behalf of the state of Rhode Island. He also served as the first chancellor of Brown (at the time called the College in the English Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations) from 1764 to 1785. His house is a minor historical site, located just off the main green at Brown. At the time of his signature of the Declaration of Independence, Stephen Hopkins served as [[Rhode Island Supreme Court|Chief Justice of Rhode Island]] and Chancellor of Brown.

In 1781, allied American and French armies under the command of General [[George Washington]] and the [[Comte de Rochambeau]], who led troops sent by King [[Louis XVI of France]], embarked on a {{convert|600|mi|km|sing=on}} [[Washington-Rochambeau Revolutionary Route|march]] from Rhode Island to [[Virginia]], where they fought and defeated British forces sent by King [[George III of the United Kingdom]] on the [[Yorktown, Virginia]] peninsula. The victory ended the major battles of the [[American Revolutionary War]]. Prior to the march, Brown University served as an encampment site for French troops, and the College Edifice, now University Hall, was turned into a military hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Other founders of Brown who played significant roles in the American revolutionary effort included [[John Brown (Rhode Island)|John Brown]] in the [[Gaspee Affair]], Chief Justice Dr. [[Joshua Babcock]] as major general in the state militia and [[William Ellery]] as a signatory to the Declaration of Independence.

[[James Mitchell Varnum]], who graduated with honors in Brown's first graduating class of 1769, served as one of General George Washington's [[Continental Army]] Brigadier Generals and later as Major General in command of the entire [[Rhode Island militia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.varnumcontinentals.org/about.htm |title=General James Mitchell Varnum House Armory History |publisher=Varnum Continentals |date= |accessdate=8 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Howell (jurist)|David Howell]], who graduated with an A.M. in the same year as General Varnum, served as a delegate to the Continental Congress from 1782 to 1785.

In 1786, President [[James Manning (minister)|James Manning]] was elected and served as representative for Rhode Island to the seventh session of the [[Congress of the Confederation|United States in Congress Assembled]], held in [[New York]]. In that capacity, he served on the Grand Committee, which proposed fundamental amendments to the Articles of Confederation and presaged the [[Constitution of the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://teachingamericanhistory.org/library/index.asp?document=1587 Proposed Amendments to the Articles of Confederation&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===New curriculum===
In 1850, Brown President [[Francis Wayland]] wrote: &quot;The various courses should be so arranged that, insofar as practicable, every student might study what he chose, all that he chose, and nothing but what he chose.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|work=About Brown
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1969, the adoption of the New Curriculum marked a milestone in the University's institutional history and is seen as a significant step towards realizing Wayland's vision. The [[curriculum]] was the result of a paper written by [[Ira Magaziner]] and Elliot Maxwell entitled &quot;Draft of a Working Paper for Education at Brown University.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The group was inspired by student-initiated experimental schools, especially [[San Francisco State University|San Francisco State College]], and sought ways to improve education for students at Brown. The philosophy they formed sought to &quot;put students at the center of their education&quot; and to &quot;teach students how to think rather than just teaching facts.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;bdh_newcurr&quot;&gt;{{cite news

[[Image:BrownUniversity-Poster1914.jpg|thumb|upright|Poster celebrating Brown's 150 year anniversary in 1914]]

The paper made a number of suggestions for improving education at Brown, including a new kind of [[interdisciplinary]] freshman course that would introduce new modes of inquiry and bring faculty from different fields together. Their goal was to transform the survey course, which traditionally sought to cover a large amount of basic material, into specialized courses that would introduce the important modes of inquiry used in different disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia

Following a student rally in support of reform, President Ray Heffner appointed the Special Committee on Curricular Philosophy with the task of developing specific reforms. These reforms, known as the Maeder Report (after the chair of the committee), were then brought to the faculty for a vote. On May 7, 1969, following a marathon meeting with 260 faculty members present, the New Curriculum was passed. Its key features included the following:&lt;ref name=&quot;bdh_newcurr&quot; /&gt;
* Modes of Thought courses aimed at first-year students
* Interdisciplinary University courses
* Students could elect to take any course Satisfactory/No Credit
* Distribution requirements were dropped
* The University simplified grades to ABC/No Credit, eliminating pluses, minuses and D's. Furthermore, &quot;No Credit&quot; would not appear on external transcripts.

Except for the Modes of Thought courses, a key component of the reforms which have been discontinued, these elements of the New Curriculum are still in place.

Additionally, due to the school's proximity and close partnership with the [[Rhode Island School of Design]] (RISD), Brown students have the opportunity to take up to four courses at RISD and have the credit count towards a Brown degree. Likewise, RISD students can also take courses at Brown. Since the two campuses are effectively adjacent to each other, the two institutions often partner to provide both student bodies with services (such as the local Brown/RISD after-hours and downtown transportation shuttles).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The first students in the new program matriculated in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release

===The College===
{{Main|The College of Brown University}}
Founded in 1764, The College is the oldest school of Brown University. Nearly 6,000 undergraduate students are currently enrolled in the college, and approximately 80 concentrations (majors) are offered. Completed concentrations of undergraduates by area are Social Sciences (42%), Humanities (26%), Life Sciences (17%), and the Physical Sciences (14%).&lt;ref name=&quot;brown.edu&quot;/&gt; The concentrations with the greatest number of students are Biology, History, and International Relations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brown.edu/Administration/Institutional_Research/annrep/2005%20PDF/TABLE11_2005.pdf Undergraduate Concentrations Completed: Selected Years]&lt;/ref&gt; Brown is one of the few schools in the United States with an undergraduate concentration (major) in [[Egyptology]]. Undergraduates can also design an independent concentration if the existing standard programs do not fit their interests.

35% of undergraduates pursue graduate or professional study immediately, 60% within 5 years, and 80% within 10 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;admit-facts&quot;&gt;[http://www.brown.edu/Administration/Admission/gettoknowus/factsandfigures.html Brown University Office of Admission facts and figures]&lt;/ref&gt; For the Class of 1998, 75% of all graduates enrolled in a graduate or professional degree program since graduating from Brown.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;http://www.brown.edu/Administration/Institutional_Research/documents/UndergraduateOutcomes2008.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The most degrees acquired were a Master's (35%) in any field, a Medical (28%), Doctoral (22%), or a Law (14%) degree, in highest order.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; There are not many who pursued the Ph.D compared to a Master's (for instance, business), or a Medical degree.

The highest fields of employment for graduates of the College are Business (36%), K-12 Education (19%), Health/Medical (6%), Arts (6%), Government (6%), and Communications/Media (5%) in highest order.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

===Graduate School===
{{Main|Brown University Graduate School}}
Established in 1887, The Graduate School currently houses over 1,700 students studying over 50 disciplines. Eight different [[master's degrees]] are offered as well as [[Ph.D.]] degrees in over 40 subjects ranging from [[Applied Mathematics]] to [[Public Policy]].

===Alpert Medical School===
{{Main|Alpert Medical School}}
{{Portal box|Medicine}}
[[Image:BrownScienceLibrary1.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Sciences Library (Brown University)|Science Library]]]]
The University's medical program started in 1811, but the school was suspended by President Wayland in 1827 after the program's faculty declined to live on campus (a new requirement under Wayland). In 1975, the first M.D. degrees from the new Program in Medicine were awarded to a graduating class of 58 students. In 1991, the school was officially renamed the Brown University School of Medicine, then renamed once more to Brown Medical School in October 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bms.brown.edu/about/history.html History of the Brown Medical School]&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2007, self-made entrepreneur Warren Alpert donated $100 million to Brown Medical School on behalf of the Warren Alpert Foundation, tying [[Sidney Frank]] for the largest single monetary contribution ever made to the University. In recognition of the gift, the faculty of Brown University approved changing the name of the Brown Medical School to The Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University. It is currently ranked 29th among U.S. medical schools in research and 28th in primary care according to [[US News and World Report]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/grad/med |title=Best Medical Schools&amp;nbsp;– Graduate Schools&amp;nbsp;– Education&amp;nbsp;– US News and World Report |publisher=Grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com |date= |accessdate=9 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Admissions to Alpert is one of the most competitive in the nation, with only less than 2% of those applying through the Standard Route accepted in 2008 (5,902 applications for 94 spots).

The medical school is known for its eight-year [[Program in Liberal Medical Education]] (PLME), which was started in 1984 and is one of the most selective programs in the nation. Each year, approximately 60 high school students matriculate into the PLME out of an applicant pool of about 1,600. Since 1976, the Early Identification Program (EIP) has encouraged Rhode Island residents to pursue careers in medicine by recruiting sophomores from [[Providence College]], [[Rhode Island College]], the [[University of Rhode Island]], and [[Tougaloo College]]. In 2004, the school once again began to accept applications from premedical students at other colleges and universities via [[AMCAS]] like most other medical schools. The medical school also offers combined degree programs leading to the M.D./[[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]], M.D./[[Master of Public Health|M.P.H.]] and M.D./[[Master of Public Policy|M.P.P.]] degrees.

===School of Engineering===
{{main|Brown University School of Engineering}}
{{Portal box|Engineering}}
Brown has the oldest engineering program in the Ivy League. In 1916, multiple Departments of Engineering were consolidated into the Division of Engineering. In 2010, the Division of Engineering was reclassified as the School of Engineering.

===Research centers and institutes===
====Marine Biological Laboratory====
{{Main|Marine Biological Laboratory}}

The [[Marine Biological Laboratory]] (MBL) is an independent research institution established in 1882 at Woods Hole, Massachusetts. The laboratory is linked to 54 current or past [[Nobel Laureates]] at its research or teaching faculty. Since 2005, the MBL and Brown University have collaborated in a Ph.D.-awarding Graduate Program in Biological and Environmental Sciences, which brings together faculty from both institutions. In 2010, the joint program was extended to include more professors participating in the partnership. The current faculty includes those from the Ecosystems Center, the Bay Paul Center, the Program in Cellular Dynamics, and the Marine Resources Center.

====Watson Institute for International Studies====
{{Main|Watson Institute for International Studies}}
[[Image:BrownUniversity-WatsonInstitute.jpg|thumb|left|The Watson Institute]]
The Watson Institute for International Studies, usually referred to as the Watson Institute, is a center for the analysis of international issues at Brown University. Its original benefactor was [[Thomas J. Watson, Jr.]], former [[Ambassador to the Soviet Union]] and president of [[IBM]].

====Pembroke Center for Teaching and Research on Women====
{{Main|Pembroke Center for Teaching and Research on Women}}
The Pembroke Center for Teaching and Research on Women, was established at Brown in 1981 as a research center on gender. It was named in honor of Pembroke College (Brown University), a decade after its merger with Brown University, and to recognize the history of women's efforts to gain access to higher education. Along with its numerous academic programs, including its sponsorship of post-doctoral research fellowships, the undergraduate concentration in [[Gender]] and [[Human sexuality|Sexuality]] Studies, and the annual Pembroke Seminar, the Pembroke Center also organizes a number of programs throughout the year to recognize the historical achievements of women. Leading historian and social scientist [[Joan Wallach Scott]] was founding director of the Center. The Pembroke Center is affiliated with the [[Sarah Doyle Women's Center]].

====Computing====
Several projects of note involving hypertext and other forms of electronic text have been developed at Brown, including [[FRESS]], [[Brown University Interactive Language]] (BRUIN), [[Hypertext Editing System]], and [[Women Writers Project]]. In addition, the Computer Science department at Brown is home to [[Cave Automatic Virtual Environment|The CAVE]]. This project is a complete [[virtual reality]] room, one of few in the world, and is used for everything from three-dimensional drawing classes to tours of the [[circulatory system]] for medical students.
In 2000, a group of students from the university's Technology House converted the south side of the Sciences Library into a giant video display which allowed bystanders to play [[Tetris]], the largest of its kind ever in the Western Hemisphere. Constructed from 11 custom-built circuit boards, a 12-story data network, a [[personal computer]] running [[Linux]], a radio-frequency video game controller, and over 10,000 Christmas lights, the project was named La Bastille and could be seen for several miles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bastilleweb.techhouse.org/ La Bastille: A Tech House Art Installation]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]'' ranked Brown 15th among national universities in its 2011 edition (published in August 2010). Undergraduates make up a larger proportion of the student body at Brown than at any of the other Ivy League universities, leading some Brown administrators to question the fairness of the ranking in light of the University's focus on undergraduate education.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.browndailyherald.com/campus-news/brown-holds-steady-at-no-15-in-annual-u-s-news-rankings-1.1676814&lt;/ref&gt;
The same edition also ranked Brown 6th among national universities for undergraduate teaching,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;A Focus on Undergrads&quot; and &quot;Best National Universities&quot;, ''U.S. News &amp; World Report: America's Best Colleges: 2010 Edition'', pp. 15, 88–9.&lt;/ref&gt; and 6th in a high school guidance counselor ranking of which universities &quot;offer the best education to their students.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/national-counselor-rank; http://www.usnews.com/articles/education/best-colleges/2009/08/19/methodology-college-picks-by-high-school-counselors.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Admission and financial aid===
Brown is one of the most selective universities in the United States. The admission rate for the undergraduate class of 2014 was 9.3 percent. 96 percent of accepted students were in the top 10 percent of their high school class, and 38 percent were either [[valedictorian]] or [[salutatorian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brown.edu/web/about/facts/admission |title=Facts about Brown University: Undergraduate Admission |publisher=Brown.edu |date= |accessdate=22 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brown began using the [[Common Application]] in the Fall of 2008. The Graduate School is also highly competitive, with graduate programs accepting 18% of the 7,283 students who applied in 2008. The Warren [[Alpert Medical School]] of Brown University accepted less than 2% of more than 5,000 applicants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Brown has recently adopted a [[financial aid (educational expenses)|financial aid]] policy which eliminates loans for all students whose family incomes are under $100,000. Furthermore, Brown has also eliminated all parental contributions for families whose incomes fall under $60,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/25/education/25brown.html Brown Ends Tuition for Lower-Income Students] ''The New York Times'' February 25, 2008 .

Brown seeks diverse applicants from &quot;all walks of life, backgrounds, interests, and cultural heritages&quot; but has &quot;no quotas of any kind&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brown.edu/Administration/Admission/appforms/secure/qanda.html Brown Q&amp;A 10/2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no official designation of different campus areas from the University, but the institution's buildings can be roughly categorized as follows.

===Main campus===
Brown's main campus is located atop College Hill, in the East Side, across the Providence River from downtown Providence. This is the where the University was relocated in 1770 after it was first established in [[Warren, Rhode Island]], in 1764. The main campus consists of 235 [[List of Brown University buildings|buildings]] and covers {{convert|143|acre|km2}}. A salient feature of Brown's campus is that many of the academic departments reside in smaller, Victorian-era houses that the University has acquired over the years from the surrounding neighborhood.

The main campus area can be subdivided further into the inner, traditional campus greens and the outer neighborhood. The two greens, the ''Main Green'' and ''Lincoln Field'', are large grass fields perpendicular to each other. These two areas contain many of the larger and more traditional academic and dormitory buildings, including University Hall (1770). This part of the main campus is enclosed by brick and rod iron fence, with the [[Van Wickle Gates]] serving as the prominent entrance on College Street. It is this area that is featured in most publications and photographs of Brown's campus.

[[Image:BrownUniversity-UniversityHall.jpg|thumb|Built in 1770, [[University Hall (Brown University)|University Hall]] is the oldest building on Brown's campus.]]

Outside of the gates, but still considered part of the main campus, are other University buildings and libraries that have been built at Brown over the centuries. This includes the [[List of Brown University buildings#Wriston Quadrangle|Wriston Quad]] to the south of the Main Green; the John Hay Library and John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Library directly across the street from the Van Wickle Gates; and the [[Sciences Library (Brown University)|Sciences Library]] and Thomas J. Watson, Sr. Center for Information Technology (CIT) adjacent to the Soldiers Memorial Gate. Because this area is not confined by the gates, Brown has been able to acquire larger plots of land and construct much larger buildings as the University has expanded.

Adjacent to Brown's main campus, and further down the Hill to the west by the Providence River, is the campus of the [[Rhode Island School of Design]]. [[Thayer Street]], which runs through Brown's campus, is a commercial district that hosts many restaurants and shops popular with students and faculty from Brown and RISD.

===Pembroke Campus===
[[Image:BrownUniversity-AndrewsHall.jpg|thumb|Andrews Hall on the Pembroke Campus]]

When [[Pembroke College (Brown University)|Pembroke College]] merged with Brown in 1971, the campus was absorbed as part of Brown's overall campus. For the most part, the campus is made up of dormitories, although notable exceptions include: Alumnae Hall, which houses a dance floor and a small University run diner known as The Gate; Smith-Buonano hall, the gymnasium of Pembroke College that was later renovated to contain many classrooms; and Pembroke Hall, the original classroom building for Pembroke College and now home to the Cogut Center for the Humanities and the [[Pembroke Center for Teaching and Research on Women]]. Furthermore, the campus has its own dining hall, Verney-Woolley Dining Hall, the second of Brown's main dining halls. Somewhere between 25 and 30% of the incoming Freshman class lives on Pembroke, though there are also many upperclassmen. The Brown Walk connects Pembroke Campus to the main campus.

===East Campus===
The '''East Campus''' was originally the main campus location of Brown's former neighbor [[Bryant College]]. Brown purchased Bryant's East Side campus in 1969 for $5.0 million when the latter school was moving to a new location. This added {{convert|10|acre|m2}} of land and additional 26 buildings adjacent to the main campus area. The area was officially designated East Campus in 1971.

===Other areas===
Also on the Hill, but further to the south and away from the main campus area, is [[Wickenden Street]], another commercial district offering restaurants and shops. Brown Stadium, built in 1925 and home to the football team, is located approximately a mile to the northeast of the main campus. More recently, Brown has expanded into the Jewelry District, located in southern downtown Providence, by acquiring and renovating five buildings to serve as administrative and research facilities. Outside of Providence, Brown also owns a {{convert|376|acre|km2|sing=on}} property, the Mount Hope Grant, in [[Bristol, Rhode Island|Bristol]], which is the setting of the [[Haffenreffer Museum of Anthropology]]. Just south of Pembroke Campus and next to the Brown Bookstore, the Granoff Center for the Creative Arts opened in January, 2011.

===John Hay Library===
{{Main|John Hay Library}}
[[Image:BrownUniversity-JohnHayLibrary.jpg|thumb|left|The [[John Hay Library]]]]
The John Hay Library is the second oldest library on campus. It was named for [[John Hay]] (class of 1858, private secretary to [[Abraham Lincoln]] and Secretary of State under two Presidents) at the request of his friend [[Andrew Carnegie]], who contributed half of the $300,000 cost of the building.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brown.edu/Administration/News_Bureau/Databases/Encyclopedia/search.php?serial=J0080 From Martha Mitchell's ''Encyclopedia Brunoniana'': John Hay Library]&lt;/ref&gt; Constructed with [[Vermont]] white [[marble]] in an [[English Renaissance]] style, the library was dedicated on November 10, 1910 and had an estimated collection of 300,000 volumes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Lovecraft]]. The Hay Library is home to one of the broadest collections of [[Incunable|incunabula]] (15th-century printed books) in the Americas, as well as such rarities as the manuscript of [[George Orwell|Orwell]]'s ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' and a Shakespeare [[First Folio]]. There are also three books bound in human skin.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, M.L.

The [[Pembroke Center for Teaching and Research on Women]] manages the Elizabeth Weed Feminist Theory Papers and the Christine Dunlap Farnham Archives, both rich resources for feminist scholars.

===John Carter Brown Library===
[[File:brown university john carter brown lib.JPG|thumb|The John Carter Brown Library]]
{{Main|John Carter Brown Library}}
The John Carter Brown Library, founded in 1846, is administered separately from the University, but has been located on the Main Green of the campus since 1904. It is generally regarded as the world's leading collection of primary historical sources pertaining to the Americas before 1825. It houses a very large percentage of the titles published before that date about the discovery, settlement, history, and natural history of the New World. The &quot;JCB&quot;, as it is known, publishes ''Bibliotheca Americana'', the main bibliography in the field. Typical of its noteworthy holdings is the best preserved of the seven surviving copies of [[Bay Psalm Book]], the first extant book printed in British North America. There is also a very fine Shakespeare [[First Folio]], added to the collection by John Carter Brown's widow (a Shakespeare enthusiast) on the grounds that it includes ''[[The Tempest]]'', a play set in the New World. The JCB holdings comprise more than 50,000 early titles and about 16,000 modern books, as well as prints, manuscripts, maps, and other items in the library's specialty. The JCB occupies a [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] style building designed by [[Shepley, Rutan, and Coolidge]].

===Boldly Brown===
Under President Ruth Simmons, the University has launched Boldly Brown: The Campaign for Academic Enrichment. This campaign consists of re-evaluating the existing curriculum and raising money for greater academic ambition. The money will be used for academic programs, research, new facilities, biology and medicine, students who need financial assistance, and expanding the faculty and staff. In June 2009, it was announced that the campaign had met its goal 19 months ahead of target, with record levels of giving despite the global economic crises of the fiscal year. The total sum raised currently stands at over US$1.5 billion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boldly.brown.edu/priorities/index.html Boldly Brown web site]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Residential and Greek Societies====
[[Image:BrownUniversity-MarcyHouse.jpg|thumb|upright|A fraternity house in Wriston Quadrangle]]
12.7% of Brown students are in [[fraternities and sororities|fraternities or sororities]]. There are 11 residential Greek houses: six all-male fraternities ([[Alpha Epsilon Pi]], [[Delta Tau]], [[Delta Phi]], [[Theta Delta Chi]], [[Sigma Chi]], and [[Phi Kappa Psi]]), two sororities ([[Alpha Chi Omega]] and [[Kappa Alpha Theta]]), one co-ed fraternity ([[Zeta Delta Xi]]), and two co-ed literary societies ([[Alpha Delta Phi#The Society|Alpha Delta Phi]] and [[St. Anthony Hall]]). All recognized Greek letter organizations live on-campus in University-owned dorm housing. Ten of the houses are overseen by the Greek Council and are located on Wriston Quadrangle. St. Anthony Hall, a co-ed fraternity that does not participate in Greek Council, is located in King House.

An alternative to fraternity life at Brown are the program houses, which are organized around various themes. As with Greek houses, the existing residents of each house take applications from students, usually at the start of the Spring semester. Examples of program houses include: Buxton International House, the Machado [[French language|French]]/[[Hispanic]] House, Art House, Technology House, Harambee (African culture) House, Culinary Arts (Cooking) House and [[Interfaith]] House.

Currently, there are three student cooperative houses at Brown. Two of the houses, Watermyn and Finlandia on Waterman Street, are owned by the [[Brown Association for Cooperative Housing]] (BACH), an independent non-profit corporation owned and operated by house members. 

The third co-op, West House, is located in a Brown-owned house on Brown Street. All three houses also run a vegetarian food co-op for residents and non-residents.

====Secret societies====
Secret societies at Brown originated as literary clubs in the mid-18th century, and primarily existed to organize debates among their members. One early literary club was the Pronouncing Society, which disbanded in the mid-1770s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

There remains some dispute over the presence of these groups today, and at least one student organization, Pacifica House, claims descent from early secret societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pacificahouse.org/ |title=Societas Domi Pacificae 1824 |publisher=Pacifica House |date= |accessdate=22 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://post.browndailyherald.com/2009/09/04/brown-a-z/ |title=Post- » Brown A-Z |publisher=Post.browndailyherald.com |date=4 September 2009 |accessdate=22 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Undergraduate Council of Students, Brown's student government, also reflects this historical legacy. The UCS originated as the Cammarian Club in 1893, a semi-secret senior society that served as an intermediary between the student body and the administration, and which ritualistically &quot;tapped&quot; 15 new men each year until its dissolution after World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia

==Traditions==
{{Main|Brown University traditions}}
Though the early history of Brown as a men's school includes a number of unusual [[hazing]] traditions, the University's present-day traditions tend to be non-violent while maintaining the spirit of zaniness.&lt;ref&gt;Poulson, Dan. (March 1, 2002). &quot;[http://web.archive.org/web/20030424194931/http://www.browndailyherald.com/post/stories.asp?ID=84 Investigating the death of campus traditions].&quot; ''The Brown Daily Herald''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Van Wickle Gates===
[[Image:ScannedImage-11.JPG|thumb|Front view of the [[Van Wickle Gates]]]]
{{Main|Van Wickle Gates}}
The Van Wickle Gates, dedicated on June 18, 1901, have a pair of center gates and a smaller gate on each side. The side gates remain open throughout the year, while the center gates remain closed except for two occasions each year. At the beginning of the academic year, the center gates open inward to admit students during Convocation. At the end of the second semester, the gates open outward for the Commencement Day procession.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, Martha. (1993). &quot;[http://www.brown.edu/Administration/News_Bureau/Databases/Encyclopedia/search.php?serial=V0020 Van Wickle Gates].&quot; ''Encyclopedia Brunoniana''&lt;/ref&gt; A traditional superstition is that students who pass through the gates for a second time before graduation do not graduate. The [[Brown University Band]] famously flouts this tradition by marching in the yearly commencement procession. Undergraduate members, however, walk through the gates backwards, thereby avoiding the hex.

===Josiah S. Carberry===
{{Main|Josiah S. Carberry}}
One of Brown's most notable traditions is keeping alive the spirit and accomplishments of [[Josiah S. Carberry]], the fictional Professor of Psychoceramics (the equally fictional study of [[crank (person)|cracked pots]]), who was born on a University Hall billboard in 1929. He is the namesake of &quot;Josiah's&quot;, a University-run snackbar. &quot;Josiah&quot; is also the name of the University's electronic library catalog.

According to Martha Mitchell's ''[[Encyclopedia Brunoniana]]'', &quot;On Friday, May 13, 1955, an anonymous gift of $101.01 was received by the University from Professor Carberry to establish the Josiah S. Carberry Fund in memory of his 'future late wife.' A condition of the gift was that, henceforth, every Friday the 13th would be designated 'Carberry Day,' and on that day friends of the University would deposit their loose change in brown jugs to augment the fund, which is used to purchase 'such books as Professor Carberry might or might not approve of.'&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;EB&quot;&gt;Mitchell, Martha. (1993). &quot;[http://www.brown.edu/Administration/News_Bureau/Databases/Encyclopedia/search.php?serial=C0070 Carberry, Josiah S.].&quot; ''Encyclopedia Brunoniana''&lt;/ref&gt; Students have followed this tradition ever since, and the fund currently has over $10,000 in it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brown.edu/Administration/Admission/gettoknowus/browntraditions.html |title=Brown Admission: Brown Traditions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mitchell writes, &quot;Professor Carberry has been the subject of articles in a number of periodicals, including ''The New York Times'', which proclaimed him 'The World's Greatest Traveler' on the front page of its Sunday travel section in 1974, and in ''Yankee'' magazine, where he was 'The Absent-Bodied Professor' in 1975. A recent honor which came to Professor Carberry was the award to him of an [[Ig Nobel Prize]] at the First Annual Ig Nobel Prize Ceremony in 1991. At this event sponsored by [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|M.I.T.]] and the ''[[Journal of Irreproducible Results]]'', Carberry, the 1991 Ig Nobel Interdisciplinary Research Prize laureate, was cited as 'bold explorer and eclectic seeker of knowledge, for his pioneering work in the field of psychoceramics, the study of cracked pots.'&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;EB&quot; /&gt;

===Spring Weekend===
{{Main|Brown University traditions#Spring_Weekend|l1=Spring Weekend}}
Starting in 1950, Brown replaced the traditional Junior Week and Junior Prom, which were discontinued during World War II, with Spring Weekend, which featured athletic contests and dances. Concerts featuring invited performers began in 1960, including [[Bob Dylan]], [[U2]], [[Bruce Springsteen]], [[Janis Joplin]], and [[James Brown]].&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, Martha. (1993). &quot;[http://www.brown.edu/Administration/News_Bureau/Databases/Encyclopedia/search.php?serial=S0380 Spring Weekend].&quot; ''Encyclopedia Brunoniana''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://students.brown.edu/Brown_Concert_Agency/ Brown Concert Agency]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alma Mater===
{{Main|Brown University Alma Mater}}
The &quot;Alma Mater&quot; was written by James Andrews DeWolf (Class of 1861) in 1860, who named it &quot;Old Brown&quot; and set it to the tune of &quot;[[1822 in music|Araby's Daughter]]&quot; (which was later known as &quot;[[Samuel Woodworth|The Old Oaken Bucket]]&quot;). The song was renamed &quot;Alma Mater&quot;, after the [[incipit]], in 1869.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, Martha. (1993). &quot;[http://www.brown.edu/Administration/News_Bureau/Databases/Encyclopedia/search.php?serial=A0170 Alma Mater].&quot; ''Encyclopedia Brunoniana''&lt;/ref&gt; It is sung and played after varsity athletic victories and at formal events such as Convocation and Commencement.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Other people2|William Atkinson (disambiguation)}}
'''Bill Atkinson''' (born 1951) is an American [[computer engineer]] and [[photographer]].  Atkinson worked at [[Apple Computer]] from 1978 to 1990. He received his undergraduate degree from the [[University of California, San Diego]], where [[Apple Macintosh]] developer [[Jef Raskin]] was one of his professors. Atkinson continued his studies as a graduate student at the [[University of Washington]].

Atkinson was part of the [[Apple Macintosh]] development team and was the creator of the ground-breaking [[MacPaint]] application, among others. He also designed and implemented [[QuickDraw]], the fundamental toolbox that the Macintosh used for graphics. QuickDraw's performance was essential for the success of the Macintosh's [[graphical user interface]]. Atkinson also designed and implemented [[HyperCard]], the first popular [[hypermedia]] system.

Around 1990, [[General Magic]]'s founding, with Bill Atkinson as one of the three co-founders, met the following press:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The obstacles to General Magic's success may appear daunting, but General Magic is not your typical start-up company. Its partners include some of the biggest players in the worlds of computing, communications, and consumer electronics, and it's loaded with top-notch engineers who have been given a clean slate to reinvent traditional approaches to ubiquitous worldwide communications. ([http://www.byte.com/art/9402/sec3/art1.htm -Byte Magazine]) &lt;/blockquote&gt; 

In 2007 Atkinson began working as an outside developer with [[Numenta]], a startup working on computer intelligence. On his work there Atkinson said, &quot;what Numenta is doing is more fundamentally important to society than the personal computer and the rise of the Internet.&quot;[http://money.cnn.com/magazines/business2/business2_archive/2007/02/01/8398989/index.htm]

Some of Atkinson's noteworthy contributions to the field of computing include:
* Macintosh [[QuickDraw]] and Lisa [[LisaGraf]]
* [[Marching ants]]
* [[Menu bar]]
* The [[Selection lasso]]
* [[FatBits]]
* [[MacPaint]]
* [[HyperCard]]
* [http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bill-atkinson-photocard/id333208430?mt=8 Bill Atkinson PhotoCard]

Atkinson now works as a nature photographer.

{{Campaignbox First English Civil War}}
The '''Battles of Lostwithiel''' or '''Lostwithiel Campaign''', took place near [[Lostwithiel]] and [[Fowey]] during the [[First English Civil War]] in 1644.

After defeating the Army of Sir [[William Waller]] at the [[Battle of Cropredy Bridge]], [[Charles I of England|King Charles]] marched west in pursuit of the Parliamentarian army of the [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]], who was invading the Royalist stronghold of [[Cornwall]].

Essex had been misled into believing that he could expect substantial support from the people of Cornwall. When he had reached [[Bodmin]] on 28 July, he found that there was no chance of supplies or recruits, and he also learned that the Royalist army was at [[Launceston, Cornwall|Launceston]], close to his rear. He withdrew to [[Lostwithiel]], covering the port of [[Fowey]]. Essex had previously arranged to rendezvous at Fowey with the Parliamentarian fleet under the [[Robert Rich, 2nd Earl of Warwick|Earl of Warwick]], but no ships appeared. Warwick was unable to leave [[Portsmouth]] because of westerly winds.

King Charles's army had been reinforced as it marched, and outnumbered that of Essex by nearly two to one. The first clashes took place on 2 August, but little action took place for several days, as the King waited for all his forces to arrive and Essex waited for the fleet. On 13 August, the Royalists began to attack in earnest, occupying several outposts on the east bank of the [[River Fowey]], making it even more difficult for help to reach Essex. A Parliamentarian attempt to send a relieving force under Lieutenant General [[John Middleton, 1st Earl of Middleton|Middleton]] was defeated at [[Bridgwater]] in [[Somerset]].

On 21 August, the Royalists attacked Essex's positions north of Lostwithiel, capturing the ruins of [[Restormel Castle]]. Royalist cavalry threatened to cut the Parliamentarians off from Fowey. Essex realised that there was no hope of relief and ordered his cavalry to break out of the encirclement. Under [[Sir William Balfour]], they broke through the Royalist lines on the night of 31 August, eventually reaching [[Plymouth]] 30 miles to the east.

The increasingly demoralised Parliamentarian infantry fell back towards Fowey in pouring rain. They were forced to abandon several guns which became bogged down in the muddy roads. On 1 September, the pursuing Royalists captured [[Castle Dore]], another ruined fortification which the Parliamentarians were using to anchor their lines. Essex left Sir [[Philip Skippon]], his Sergeant Major General of Foot, in command while he himself escaped to [[Plymouth]] in a fishing boat.

On 2 September, Skippon, having been told that his infantry were unable to break out as the cavalry had done, and having been offered generous terms by the King, surrendered 6,000 infantry and all his army's guns and train. The disarmed soldiers marched eastward to Portsmouth in continuing bad weather, being continually robbed and threatened by local people. About 1,000 died of exposure and hunger, and 1,000 more deserted or fell sick.
Charles meanwhile wheeled about and marched toward [[London]].

This setback for Parliament in [[Cornwall]], and the last major victory for the Royalists, was reversed by [[Sir Thomas Fairfax]] leading the [[New Model Army]] at or near [[Tresillian|Tresillian Bridge]], close to [[Truro]] on 12 March 1645.

D. Irvine, (New York 1999) page 178&lt;/ref&gt; [[philosopher]], [[mathematical logic|logician]], [[mathematician]], [[historian]], and [[social critic]].&lt;ref name=&quot;stanford&quot;&gt;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/russell/ &quot;Bertrand Russell&quot;], 1 May 2003&lt;/ref&gt; At various points in his life, he imagined himself in turn a [[Liberalism|liberal]], a [[socialist]], and a [[pacifist]], but he also admitted that he had never been any of these things, in any profound sense.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;I have imagined myself in turn a Liberal, a Socialist, or a Pacifist, but I have never been any of these things, in any profound sense.&quot; --''Autobiography'', p. 260.&lt;/ref&gt; He was born in [[Wales]], into one of the most prominent aristocratic families in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Wales|last=Hestler|first=Anna|page=53|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|year=2001|isbn=076141195X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Russell led the British &quot;revolt against [[idealism]]&quot; in the early 1900s. He is considered one of the founders of [[analytic philosophy]] along with his predecessor [[Gottlob Frege]] and his protégé [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], and is widely held to be one of the 20th century's premier logicians.&lt;ref name=&quot;stanford&quot; /&gt; He co-authored, with [[A.

==Biography==
===Ancestry===
Bertrand Russell was born on 18 May 1872 at Ravenscroft, [[Trellech]], [[Monmouthshire (historic)|Monmouthshire]], [[Wales]], into an influential and liberal family of the [[British aristocracy|English aristocracy]]. His paternal grandfather, [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell]], was the third son of [[John Russell, 6th Duke of Bedford]], and had twice been asked by [[Queen Victoria]] to form a government, serving her as [[Prime Minister]] in the 1840s and 1860s.&lt;ref name=&quot;John R&quot;&gt;{{cite web| last = Bloy| first = Marjie, [[Ph.D.]]| title = Lord John Russell (1792–1878)| url=http://www.victorianweb.org/history/pms/russell.html| accessdate = 28 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:John Russell Viscount Amberley.jpg|thumb|160px|Bertrand Russell's father, [[John Russell, Viscount Amberley]]]]
The Russells had been prominent in England for several centuries before this, coming to power and the peerage with the rise of the [[Tudor dynasty]]. They established themselves as one of Britain's leading [[British Whig Party|Whig]] families, and participated in every great political event from the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] in 1536–40 to the [[Glorious Revolution]] in 1688–89 to the [[Great Reform Act]] in 1832.&lt;ref name=&quot;John R&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;peerage&quot;&gt;Cokayne, G.E.; Vicary Gibbs, H.A.

The Complete Peerage of England, Scotland, Ireland, Great Britain and the United Kingdom, Extant, Extinct or Dormant, new ed. 13 volumes in 14. 1910–1959. Reprint in 6 volumes, Gloucester, UK: Alan Sutton Publishing, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Russell's mother Katharine Louisa (1844–1874) was the daughter of [[Edward Stanley, 2nd Baron Stanley of Alderley]], and was the sister of [[Rosalind Howard]], Countess of Carlisle.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallery&quot;/&gt; Kate and Rosalind's mother was one of the founders of [[Girton College, Cambridge]].&lt;ref&gt;The women's suffrage movement: a reference guide, 1866–1928 By Elizabeth Crawford&lt;/ref&gt;

Russell's parents were radical for their times. Russell's father, [[John Russell, Viscount Amberley|Viscount Amberley]], was an [[atheist]] and consented to his wife's affair with their children's tutor, the biologist [[Douglas Spalding]]. Both were early advocates of [[birth control]] at a time when this was considered scandalous.&lt;ref name=&quot;calicut&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Paul|first=Ashley|title=Bertrand Russell: The Man and His Ideas.|url=http://www.geocities.com/vu3ash/index.html|accessdate=28 October 2007|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060501064331/http://www.geocities.com/vu3ash/index.html|archivedate=1 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Russell's atheism was evident when he asked the philosopher [[John Stuart Mill]] to act as Russell's secular [[godparent|godfather]].&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Bertrand and Perkins, Ray (ed.) ''Yours faithfully, Bertrand Russell''. Open Court Publishing, 2001, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Mill died the year after Russell's birth, but his writings had a great effect on Russell's life.

===Childhood and adolescence===
Russell had two siblings: [[Frank Russell, 2nd Earl Russell|Frank]] (nearly seven years older than Bertrand), and Rachel (four years older). In June 1874 Russell's mother died of [[diphtheria]], followed shortly by Rachel's death. In January 1876, his father also died of [[bronchitis]] following a long period of depression. Frank and Bertrand were placed in the care of their staunchly [[Victorian morality|Victorian]] grandparents, who lived at [[Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park|Pembroke Lodge]] in [[Richmond Park]]. [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell]], his grandfather, who had been [[Prime Minister]], died in 1878, and was remembered by Russell as a kindly old man in a wheelchair. As a result, his widow, the Countess Russell (née Lady Frances Elliot), was the dominant family figure for the rest of Russell's childhood and youth.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallery&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;calicut&quot;/&gt;

The countess was from a Scottish [[Presbyterian]] family, and successfully petitioned a British [[court]] to set aside a provision in Amberley's [[will (law)|will]] requiring the children to be raised as [[agnostics]]. Despite her religious conservatism, she held progressive views in other areas (accepting [[Darwinism]] and supporting [[Home Rule|Irish Home Rule]]), and her influence on Bertrand Russell's outlook on [[social justice]] and standing up for principle remained with him throughout his life&amp;nbsp;— her favourite Bible verse, 'Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil' ([[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 23:2), became his motto. The atmosphere at Pembroke Lodge was one of frequent prayer, emotional repression and formality; Frank reacted to this with open rebellion, but the young Bertrand learned to hide his feelings.

Russell's [[adolescence]] was very lonely, and he often contemplated suicide. He remarked in his autobiography that his keenest interests were in religion and mathematics, and that only the wish to know more mathematics kept him from suicide.&lt;ref&gt;''The Autobiography of Bertrand Russell'', p.38&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated at home by a series of tutors.&lt;ref name=&quot;nobel prize&quot;/&gt; His brother Frank introduced him to the work of [[Euclid]], which transformed Russell's life.&lt;ref name=&quot;calicut&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Greeks&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author=Lenz, John R.|title=Bertrand Russell and the Greeks|date=date unknown|url=http://digitalcommons.mcmaster.ca/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1443&amp;context=russelljournal|format=PDF|accessdate=27 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, during these formative years, he discovered the works of [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]]. In his autobiography, he writes: &quot;I spent all my spare time reading him, and learning him by heart, knowing no one to whom I could speak of what I thought or felt, I used to reflect how wonderful it would have been to know Shelley, and to wonder whether I should meet any live human being with whom I should feel so much sympathy.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''The Autobiography of Bertrand Russell'', p.35&lt;/ref&gt; Russell claimed that beginning at age 15, he spent considerable time thinking about the validity of [[Christian]] religious dogma, and by 18 had decided to discard the last of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://richarddawkins.net/articles/4833|title=Bertrand Russell on God|year=1959|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]|accessdate=8 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===University and first marriage===
Russell won a scholarship to read for the [[Mathematical Tripos]] at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], and commenced his studies there in 1890.&lt;ref&gt;{{Venn|id=RSL890BA|name=Russell, the Hon. Bertrand Arthur William}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became acquainted with the younger [[George Edward Moore|G.E. Moore]] and came under the influence of [[Alfred North Whitehead]], who recommended him to the [[Cambridge Apostles]]. He quickly distinguished himself in mathematics and philosophy, graduating as a high [[Wrangler (University of Cambridge)|Wrangler]] in 1893 and becoming a Fellow in the latter in 1895.&lt;ref name=&quot;Whitehead&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Whitehead.html|title=Alfred North Whitehead|accessdate=8 November 2007|last=O'Connor|first=J.

Russell first met the American [[Religious Society of Friends|Quaker]] [[Alys Pearsall Smith]] when he was seventeen years old. He became a friend of the Pearsall Smith family—they knew him primarily as 'Lord John's grandson' and enjoyed showing him off—and travelled with them to the continent; it was in their company that Russell visited the [[Paris Exhibition of 1889]] and was able to climb the [[Eiffel Tower]] soon after it was completed.&lt;ref name=&quot;MarriagePt1&quot;&gt;Wallenchinsky et al. (1981), &quot;Famous Marriages Bertrand...Part 1&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

He soon fell in love with the puritanical, high-minded Alys, who was a graduate of [[Bryn Mawr College]] near [[Philadelphia]], and, contrary to his grandmother's wishes, married her on 13 December 1894. Their marriage began to fall apart in 1901 when it occurred to Russell, while he was cycling, that he no longer loved her. She asked him if he loved her and he replied that he didn't. Russell also disliked Alys's mother, finding her controlling and cruel. It was to be a hollow shell of a marriage and they finally divorced in 1921, after a lengthy period of separation.&lt;ref name=&quot;MPt3&quot;&gt;Wallenchinsky et al. (1981), &quot;Famous Marriages Bertrand...Part 3&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;
During this period, Russell had passionate (and often simultaneous) affairs with a number of women, including Lady [[Ottoline Morrell]] and the actress Lady [[Constance Malleson]].&lt;ref name=&quot;private&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newcriterion.com:81/archive/11/sept92/brussell.htm|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061205032455/newcriterion.com/archive/11/sept92/brussell.htm|archivedate=5 December 2006|title=Love, logic &amp; unbearable pity: The private Bertrand Russell|accessdate=15 November 2007|last=Kimball|first=Roger|work=The New Criterion Vol. 11, No. 1,&amp;nbsp;September 1992|publisher=The New Criterion}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early career===
Russell began his published work in 1896 with ''German [[Social Democracy]]'', a study in politics that was an early indication of a lifelong interest in political and social theory. In 1896, he taught German social democracy at the [[London School of Economics]], where he also lectured on the science of power in the autumn of 1937.&lt;ref name=&quot;LSE&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/EDlse.htm|title=London School of Economics|last=Simkin|first=John|accessdate=16 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also a member of the [[Coefficients (dining club)|Coefficients dining club]] of social reformers set up in 1902 by the [[Fabian Society|Fabian]] campaigners [[Sidney Webb|Sidney]] and [[Beatrice Webb]].&lt;ref name=&quot;LettersPg16&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Russell|first=Bertrand|editor=Ray Perkins|title=Yours Faithfully, Bertrand Russell: Letters to the Editor 1904–1969|year=2001|publisher=Open Court Publishing|location=Chicago|isbn=0-8126-9449-X|page=16|url=http://books.google.com/?id=EayyTTpXL-QC&amp;pg=PA16&amp;lpg=PA16|accessdate=16 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He now started an intensive study of the [[foundations of mathematics]] at Trinity during which he discovered [[Russell's paradox]] which challenged the foundations of [[set theory]]. In 1903 he published his first important book on mathematical logic, ''[[The Principles of Mathematics]]'' showing that mathematics could be deduced from a very small number of principles, and contributing significantly to the cause of [[logicism]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1950/russell-bio.html|title=Bertrand Russell, Biography|publisher=Nobelprize.org|accessdate=23 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1905 he wrote the essay &quot;[[On Denoting]]&quot;, which was published in the philosophical journal ''[[Mind (journal)|Mind]]''. Russell became a fellow of the [[Royal Society]] in 1908.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallery&quot;/&gt; The first of three volumes of ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'', written with Whitehead, was published in 1910, which, along with the earlier ''The Principles of Mathematics'', soon made Russell world famous in his field.

In 1910 he became a lecturer in the [[University of Cambridge]] where he soon received an approach from the Austrian engineering student [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], who became his [[PhD]] student and whom he viewed as a genius and a successor who would continue his work on logic. He spent hours dealing with Wittgenstein's various phobias and his frequent bouts of despair. This was often a drain on Russell's energy, but Russell continued to be fascinated by him and encouraged his [[academic]] development, including the publication of Wittgenstein's ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]'' in 1922.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wittgenstein&quot;&gt;[http://www.rbjones.com/rbjpub/philos/history/rvw001.htm Russell on Wittgenstein]&lt;/ref&gt; Russell delivered his lectures on [[Logical Atomism]], his version of these ideas, in 1918 before the end of the First World War and whilst Wittgenstein was still a prisoner of war.

===First World War===
During the [[World War I|First World War]], Russell was one of a very small number of intellectuals engaged in [[opposition to World War I|pacifist activities]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Hochschild | first = Adam | year = 2011 | title = 'I Tried to Stop the Bloody Thing' | periodical = The American Scholar | url = http://www.theamericanscholar.org/i-tried-to-stop-the-bloody-thing/ | accessdate = 2011-05-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and, in 1916, he was dismissed from Trinity College following his conviction under the [[Defence of the Realm Act]]. 
He was charged a fine of 100 Pounds Sterling which he refused to pay, hoping that he would be sent to prison, but they instead sold his books at auction to raise the money. The books were bought by friends and he later treasured his copy of the King James Bible that was stamped &quot;Confiscated by Cambridge Police.&quot;
He was reinstated 1919, resigned 1920, was Tarner Lecturer 1926, and became a Fellow again 1944–1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Trinity College|url=http://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/index.php?pageid=24|title=Trinity in Literature|accessdate=23 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A later conviction for publicly lecturing against inviting the US to enter the war on Britain's side, resulted in six months' imprisonment in [[Brixton (HM Prison)|Brixton prison]] (see ''[[Bertrand Russell's views on society]]'').&lt;ref name=&quot;Pacifist&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Bertrand Russell and the Pacifists in the First World War|last=Vellacott|first=Jo|isbn=0855274549|publisher=Harvester Press|location=Brighton|year=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russell was released from prison in September 1918.

===Between the wars, and second marriage===
[[File:Bertrand Russell 1950.jpg|thumb|Russell]]
In August 1920, Russell travelled to Russia as part of an official delegation sent by the British government to investigate the effects of the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]].&lt;ref name=&quot;FreeLib&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Bertrand Russell (1872–1970)|publisher=Farlex, Inc.|url=http://russell.thefreelibrary.com/|accessdate=11 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He met [[Vladimir Lenin]] and had an hour-long conversation with him. In his autobiography, he mentions that he found Lenin rather disappointing, sensing an &quot;impish cruelty&quot; in him and comparing him to &quot;an opinionated professor&quot;. He also cruised down the [[Volga]] on a steam-ship. Russell's lover [[Dora Russell|Dora Black]] also visited Russia independently at the same time&amp;nbsp;— she was enthusiastic about the revolution, but Russell's experiences destroyed his previous tentative support for it. He wrote a book &quot;The Practice and Theory of Bolshevism&quot; about his experiences on this trip, which included 24 others from Britain, all of whom came home thinking well of the regime, despite Russell's attempts to change their mind. For example, he told them that he heard shots fired in the middle of the night and was sure these were clandestine executions, but the others maintained that it was only cars backfiring. 

Russell subsequently lectured in [[Beijing]] on philosophy for one year, accompanied by Dora. He went there with optimism and hope, as [[China]] was then on a new path. Among other scholars there was [[Rabindranath Tagore]], the [[India]]n poet and also a Nobel Laureate.&lt;ref name=&quot;nobel prize&quot;/&gt; While in China, Russell became gravely ill with [[pneumonia]], and [[List of premature obituaries|incorrect reports]] of his death were published in the [[Japan]]ese press.&lt;ref name=&quot;pneumonia&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Bertrand Russell Reported Dead|publisher=The New York Times|date=21 April 1921|accessdate=11 December 2007|format=PDF|url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?_r=1&amp;res=9B01E7DB1739E133A25752C2A9629C946095D6CF&amp;oref=slogin}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the couple visited Japan on their return journey, Dora notified the world that &quot;Mr. Bertrand Russell, having died according to the Japanese press, is unable to give interviews to Japanese journalists.&quot; The press were not amused and did not appreciate the sarcasm.&lt;ref name=&quot;papers&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Uncertain Paths to Freedom: Russia and China, 1919–22|work=The Collected Papers of Bertrand Russell|volume=15|publisher=Routledge|year=2000|isbn=0415094119|last=Russell|first=Bertrand|editor=Richard A.

On the couple's return to England on 26 August 1921, Dora was six months pregnant, and Russell arranged a hasty divorce from Alys, marrying Dora six days after the divorce was finalised, on 27 September 1921. Their children were [[John Conrad Russell, 4th Earl Russell]], born on 16 November 1921 and [[Katharine Russell|Katharine Jane Russell]] (now Lady Katharine Tait) born on 29 December 1923. Russell supported himself during this time by writing popular books explaining matters of [[physics]], [[ethics]], and [[education]] to the [[layman]]. Some have suggested that at this point he had an affair with [[Vivienne Haigh-Wood]], first wife of [[T. S. Eliot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Ray|last=Monk|title=‘Russell, Bertrand Arthur William, third Earl Russell (1872–1970)’|work=[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|month=September|year=2004|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/35875|accessdate=14 March 2008|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/35875}}{{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together with Dora, he also founded the experimental Beacon Hill School in 1927. The school was run from a succession of different locations, including its original premises at the Russells' residence, Telegraph House, near [[Harting]], [[West Sussex]]. On 8 July 1930 Dora welcomed her third child, a daughter, Harriet Ruth. After he left the school in 1932, Dora continued it until 1943.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beacon&quot;&gt;Inside Beacon Hill: Bertrand Russell as Schoolmaster. ''Jespersen, Shirley'' ERIC# EJ360344, published 1987&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dora&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Dora Russell|url=http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/TUrussellD.htm|date=12 May 2007|accessdate=17 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon the death of his elder brother Frank, in 1931, Russell became the 3rd Earl Russell. He once said that his title was primarily useful for securing hotel rooms.

Russell's marriage to Dora grew increasingly tenuous, and it reached a breaking point over her having two children with an American journalist, Griffin Barry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dora&quot;/&gt; They separated in 1932 and finally divorced. On 18 January 1936, Russell married his third wife, an [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] undergraduate named [[Patricia Russell (nee Spence)|Patricia (&quot;Peter&quot;) Spence]], who had been his children's [[governess]] since the summer of 1930. Russell and Peter had one son, [[Conrad Russell, 5th Earl Russell|Conrad Sebastian Robert Russell]], 5th Earl Russell, who became a prominent historian and one of the leading figures in the [[Liberal Democrats|Liberal Democrat]] party.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallery&quot;/&gt;

===Second World War===
{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}

Russell opposed rearmament against Nazi Germany, but in 1940 changed his view that avoiding a full scale world war was more important than defeating Hitler.  He concluded that Adolf Hitler taking over all of Europe would be a permanent threat to democracy.  In 1943, he adopted a stance toward large-scale warfare, &quot;Relative Political Pacifism&quot;:  War was always a great evil, but in some particularly extreme circumstances, it may be the lesser of two evils.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Bertrand, “The Future of Pacifism”, The American Scholar, (1943) 13: 7–13&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-Second World War===
Before the [[World War II|Second World War]], Russell taught at the [[University of Chicago]], later moving on to Los Angeles to lecture at the [[UCLA Department of Philosophy|University of California, Los Angeles]]. He was appointed professor at the [[City College of New York]] in 1940, but after a public outcry, the appointment was annulled by a court judgement: his opinions (especially those relating to [[sexual morality]], detailed in ''[[Marriage and Morals]]'' ten years earlier) made him &quot;morally unfit&quot; to teach at the college. The protest was started by the mother of a student who would not have been eligible for his graduate-level course in mathematical logic. Many intellectuals, led by [[John Dewey]], protested against his treatment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Denied&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Appointment Denied: The Inquisition of Bertrand Russell|author=Leberstein, Stephen|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3860/is_200111/ai_n9008065/|publisher=Academe|date=November/December 2001|accessdate=17 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Albert Einstein]]'s often-quoted aphorism that &quot;Great spirits have always encountered violent opposition from mediocre minds...&quot; originated in his open letter in support of Russell, during this time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asl-associates.com/einsteinquotes.htm] Einstein quotations and sources. Retrieved 9 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Dewey and [[Horace M. Kallen]] edited a collection of articles on the CCNY affair in ''[[The Bertrand Russell Case]]''. He soon joined the [[Barnes Foundation]], lecturing to a varied audience on the history of philosophy; these lectures formed the basis of ''[[A History of Western Philosophy]]''. His relationship with the eccentric [[Albert C. Barnes]] soon soured, and he returned to Britain in 1944 to rejoin the faculty of Trinity College.&lt;ref name=&quot;professor&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Bertrand Russell|url=http://www.philosophyprofessor.com/philosophers/bertrand-russell.php|year=2006|accessdate=17 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later life===
During the 1940s and 1950s, Russell participated in many broadcasts over the BBC, particularly [[The Brains Trust]] and the [[BBC Third Programme|Third Programme]], on various topical and philosophical subjects. By this time Russell was world famous outside of academic circles, frequently the subject or author of magazine and newspaper articles, and was called upon to offer up opinions on a wide variety of subjects, even mundane ones. En route to one of his lectures in [[Trondheim]], Russell was one of 24 survivors (among a total of 43 passengers) in an [[Bukken Bruse disaster|aeroplane crash in Hommelvik]] in October 1948.&lt;ref name=&quot;letters&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=The Selected Letters of Bertrand Russell|page=660|publisher=Routledge|author=Griffin, Nicholas (ed.)|year=2002|isbn=0415260124}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[A History of Western Philosophy]]'' (1945) became a best-seller, and provided Russell with a steady income for the remainder of his life.

In a speech in 1948,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.economist.com/books/PrinterFriendly.cfm?Story_ID=699582 | work=The Economist | title=A philosopher’s letters – Love, Bertie – Economist.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russell said that if the USSR's aggression continued, it would be morally worse to go to war after the USSR possessed an atomic bomb than before they possessed one, because if the USSR had no bomb the West's victory would come more swiftly and with fewer casualties than if there were atom bombs on both sides. At that time, only the USA possessed an atomic bomb, and the USSR was pursuing an extremely aggressive policy towards the countries in [[Eastern Europe]] which it was absorbing into its [[sphere of influence]]. Many understood Russell's comments to mean that Russell approved of a [[first strike]] in a war with the USSR, including Lawson, who was present when Russell spoke. Others, including Griffin who obtained a transcript of the speech, have argued that he was merely explaining the usefulness of America's atomic arsenal in deterring the USSR from continuing its domination of Eastern Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;letters&quot; /&gt;

Russell also continued to write about philosophy. He wrote a foreword to ''Words and Things'' by [[Ernest Gellner]] which was highly critical of the later thought of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] and of [[Ordinary language philosophy]]. [[Gilbert Ryle]] refused to have the book reviewed in the philosophical journal ''[[Mind (journal)|Mind]]'' which caused Russell to respond via [[the Times]]. The results was a month-long correspondence in the Times, between the supporters and detractors of Ordinary language philosophy which was only ended when the Times published an editorial about the matter, which was critical of both sides but agreeing with the opponents of Ordinary language philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;T. P. Uschanov, [http://www.helsinki.fi/~tuschano/writings/strange/ The Strange Death of Ordinary Language Philosophy]. The controversy has been described by the writer [[Ved Mehta]] in ''Fly and the Fly Bottle'' (1963).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[King's Birthday Honours]] of 9 June 1949, Russell was awarded the [[Order of Merit (Commonwealth)|Order of Merit]],&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=38628|supp=yes|startpage=2796|date=3 June 1949|accessdate=11 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the following year he was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallery&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nobel prize&quot;/&gt; When he was given the Order of Merit, [[King George VI]] was affable but slightly embarrassed at decorating a former [[jail]]bird, saying that &quot;You have sometimes behaved in a manner that would not do if generally adopted.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ronald W. Clark, Bertrand Russell and His World, p94. (1981) ISBN 0-500-13070-1&lt;/ref&gt;  Russell merely smiled, but afterwards claimed that the reply &quot;That's right, just like your [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|brother]]&quot; immediately came to mind.

In 1952, Russell was divorced by Spence, with whom he had been very unhappy. Conrad, Russell's son by Spence, did not see his father between the time of the divorce and 1968 (at which time his decision to meet his father caused a permanent breach with his mother).

Russell married his fourth wife, [[Edith Finch Russell|Edith Finch]], soon after the divorce, on 15 December 1952. They had known each other since 1925, and Edith had taught English at [[Bryn Mawr College]] near [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], sharing a house for twenty years with Russell's old friend Lucy Donnelly. Edith remained with him until his death, and, by all accounts, their marriage was a happy, close, and loving one. Russell's eldest son, John, suffered from serious [[mental illness]], which was the source of ongoing disputes between Russell and John's mother, Russell's former wife, Dora. John's wife Susan was also mentally ill, and eventually Russell and Edith became the legal guardians of their three daughters {{Citation needed|reason= in the article on Bertrand's son, John, it is stated that there were only two daughters|date=November 2010}}(two of whom were later found to have [[schizophrenia]]).

In 1962, Russell played a public role in the [[Cuban Missile Crisis#Crisis deepens|Cuban Missile Crisis]]: in an exchange of telegrams with the Soviet Union leader [[Nikita Khrushchev]], Khrushchev assured him that the Soviet government would not be reckless.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book|title=|url=World Peace Efforts Since Gandhi|author=Sanderson Beck|accessdate=23 June 2010|unused_data=http://www.san.beck.org/GPJ24-Russell,Muste.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Russell also wrote to President Kennedy, who returned his telegram unopened.

===Political causes===
Russell spent the 1950s and 1960s engaged in various political causes, primarily related to nuclear disarmament and opposing the [[Vietnam war]] (see also [[Russell Tribunal|Russell Vietnam War Crimes Tribunal]]). The 1955 [[Russell–Einstein Manifesto]] was a document calling for nuclear disarmament and was signed by 11 of the most prominent nuclear physicists and intellectuals of the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Manifesto&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Russell Einstein Manifesto|url=http://www.ppu.org.uk/learn/texts/doc_russelleinstein_manif.html|author=Russell, Bertrand|coauthors=[[Albert Einstein]]|date=9 July 1955|accessdate=17 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote a great many letters to world leaders during this period. He was in contact with [[Lionel Rogosin]] while the latter was filming his anti-war film ''Good Times, Wonderful Times'' in the 1960s. He also became a hero to many of the youthful members of the [[New Left]]. In early 1963, in particular, Russell became increasingly vocal about his disapproval of what he felt to be the US government's near-genocidal policies in South Vietnam. In 1963 he became the inaugural recipient of the [[Jerusalem Prize]], an award for writers concerned with the freedom of the individual in society.&lt;ref name=&quot;jerusalem prize&quot;&gt;[http://www.jerusalembookfair.com/main.html Jerusalem International Book Fair]&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1965 he tore up his [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] card because he feared the party was going to send soldiers to support the USA in the Vietnam War.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallery&quot;/&gt;

===Final years and death===
[[File:Bust Of Bertrand Russell-Red Lion Square-London.jpg|thumb|right|Bust of Russell in [[Red Lion Square]].]]
Russell published his three-volume autobiography in 1967, 1968, and 1969. On 23 November 1969 he wrote to ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper saying that the preparation for show trials in [[Czechoslovakia]] was &quot;highly alarming&quot;. The same month he appealed to Secretary General [[U Thant]] of the United Nations to support an international war crimes commission to investigate alleged torture and genocide by the USA in South Vietnam. The following month, he protested to [[Alexei Kosygin]] over the expulsion of [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]] from the Writers Union.

On 31 January 1970, Russell issued a statement which condemned Israeli aggression in the Middle East and called for Israeli withdrawal from territory occupied in 1967. This was Russell's final political statement or act. It was read out at the International Conference of Parliamentarians in [[Cairo]] on 3 February 1970, the day after his death.&lt;ref name='Last Message'&gt;[http://www.connexions.org/CxLibrary/Docs/CX5576-RussellMidEast.htm Bertrand Russell's Last Message].&lt;/ref&gt; 

Russell died of [[influenza]] on 2 February 1970 at his home, [[Plas Penrhyn]], in [[Penrhyndeudraeth]], [[Merionethshire]], Wales. He was cremated in [[Colwyn Bay]] on 5 February 1970. In accordance with his will there was no religious ceremony; his ashes were scattered over the Welsh mountains later that year.

In 1980, a memorial to Russell was commissioned by a committee including [[A. J. Ayer]]. It consists of a bust of Russell in [[Red Lion Square]] in [[London]] sculpted by Marcelle Quinton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Bertrand Russell Memorial | journal=Mind | year=1980 | volume=353 | page=320}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views==
{{Infobox Bertrand Russell}}

===Views on philosophy===
{{Main|Bertrand Russell's views on philosophy}}
Russell is generally credited with being one of the founders of [[analytic philosophy]]. He was deeply impressed by [[Gottfried Leibniz]] (1646–1716) and wrote on every major area of philosophy except aesthetics. He was particularly prolific in the field of [[metaphysics]], the [[Bertrand Russell's views on philosophy#Logic and philosophy of mathematics|logic and the philosophy of mathematics]], the [[Bertrand Russell's views on philosophy#Philosophy of language|philosophy of language]], [[Bertrand Russell's views on philosophy#Ethics|ethics]] and [[Bertrand Russell's views on philosophy#Epistemology|epistemology]]. When [[Brand Blanshard]] asked Russell why he didn't write on aesthetics, Russell replied that he didn't know anything about it, &quot;but that is not a very good excuse, for my friends tell me it has not deterred me from writing on other subjects.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Blanshard, in [[Paul Arthur Schilpp]], ed., ''The Philosophy of Brand Blanshard'', Open Court, 1980, p. 88, quoting a private letter from Russell.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Views on society===
{{Main|Bertrand Russell's views on society}}
Political and social [[activism]] occupied much of Russell's time for most of his life, which makes his prodigious and seminal writing on a wide range of technical and non-technical subjects all the more remarkable. Russell remained politically active almost to the end of his life, writing to and exhorting world leaders and lending his name to various causes. He was also famously noted for saying &quot;No one can sit at the bedside of a dying child and still believe in God.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Problem of Evil&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conversantlife.com/theology/the-problem-of-evil-everyones-problem|title=Problem of Evil}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Note: These are major publications.  Russell also wrote many pamphlets, introductions, articles and letters to the editor. His works also can be found in any number of anthologies and collections, perhaps most notably ''The Collected Papers of Bertrand Russell'', which [[McMaster University]] began publishing in 1983. This collection of his shorter and previously unpublished works is now up to 16 volumes, and many more are forthcoming. An additional three volumes catalogue just his bibliography. The Russell Archives at [[McMaster University]] also have more than 30,000 letters that he wrote.

The '''Boeing 767''' is a mid-size [[wide-body]] [[Twinjet|twin-engine]] [[airliner]] produced by [[Boeing Commercial Airplanes]]. Boeing 767 versions have a range of 5,200 to 6,590 [[nautical miles]] (9,400 to 12,200&amp;nbsp;km), and can carry between 181 and 375 passengers, depending on seating arrangement. The first wide-body twinjet produced by Boeing, the 767 was conceived and designed in tandem with the [[Narrow-body aircraft|narrow-body]] [[Boeing 757]] twinjet. The airliners share design features and [[Cockpit|flight deck]]s, enabling pilots to obtain a common [[type rating]] to operate the two aircraft. 

The 767 was also the first Boeing wide-body airliner with a two-person flight deck, eliminating the need for a [[flight engineer]]. The airliner has been produced in three fuselage lengths. The original [[#767-200|767-200]] entered airline service in 1982, followed by the [[#767-300|767-300]] in 1986, and the [[#767-400ER|767-400ER]] in 2000. The [[#767-200ER|767-200ER]] and [[#767-300ER|767-300ER]] have added payload and range. The [[#767-300F|767-300F]], a production [[Cargo aircraft|freighter version]], entered service in 1995.

Following in-service indications of its twinjet design reliability, the 767 received regulatory approval allowing extended transoceanic operations beginning in 1985. The aircraft is regarded as an [[ETOPS]] pioneer, being the first to receive 180-minute approval by the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA). Through the 1990s, the Boeing 767 became commonly operated on [[Flight length|medium- to long-haul]] routes, and the aircraft has ranked as the most widely used airliner for [[transatlantic flight]]s between the [[United States]] and [[Europe]].  There have been over 1,000 Boeing 767s ordered with over 990 delivered by early 2011.  The 1,000th airframe was rolled out in February 2011, making the 767 only the second wide-body (after the [[Boeing 747]]) to have exceeded the 1,000 unit mark.  The -300/-300ER models are the most popular variants, accounting for about two-thirds of all 767s ordered. In July 2010, 863 767s were in service with more than 40 airlines.

==Development==
===Background===
In 1972, following the introduction of the first generation [[Boeing 747]], [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10|Douglas DC-10]], and the [[Lockheed L-1011 TriStar]] [[wide-body aircraft|wide-body]] airliners into passenger service,&lt;ref name=wells&gt;{{harvnb|Wells|Rodrigues|2004|page= 146}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boeing embarked on parallel development studies for two new airliners.&lt;ref name=norris_p18&gt;{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1999|pp=18–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Code name|Code-named]] 7X7 and 7N7, these studies aimed to take advantage of new materials and propulsion advances in the civil aerospace industry.&lt;ref name=norris_p18/&gt; The 7N7, which developed into the [[Boeing 757]], was conceived as a narrow-body twinjet replacement for the [[Boeing 727]].&lt;ref name=norris_p18/&gt; The 7X7 was intended to be a mid-size wide-body airliner slotted between the [[Boeing 707]] and Douglas DC-10.&lt;ref name=norris_p18/&gt; With aging fleets of 707s needing replacement, the 7X7 would slot between the Boeing's narrow-body jetliners and the 747. Initially, the 7X7 studies focused on a [[trijet]] design,&lt;ref name=norris_p18/&gt; with possible configurations including overwing engines, a [[T-tail]], and others.&lt;ref name=Eden_p102&gt;{{harvnb|Eden|2008|pp=102–03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976, a twinjet wide-body layout, similar to the earlier [[Airbus A300|Airbus A300B]], became the preferred configuration, reflecting increased industry confidence in the reliability and economics of new generation turbofan engines.&lt;ref name=norris_p18/&gt; Airlines remained ambiguous in their requirements for the aircraft,&lt;ref name=norris_p18/&gt; which was roughly focused on the [[medium-haul]], high-density market.&lt;ref name=Eden_p102/&gt; High-density routes in the U.S. domestic market, a role targeted for the 7X7, involved the transport of large numbers of passengers between major cities.&lt;ref name=Eden_p102/&gt;

On January 5, 1978, Boeing announced a major extension of its [[Boeing Everett Factory|Everett production site]], then dedicated to 747 manufacture, to accommodate its new mid-size wide-body family.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Birtles|1999|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; That year, Boeing formally designated its new wide-body airliner as the 767, and the company planned to offer three variants: a 767-100 with 180 seats,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Donald|1997|page = 173}}&lt;/ref&gt; a larger 767-200 with 210 seats, and a trijet 767MR/LR version with 200 seats intended for intercontinental routes.&lt;ref name=norris_p18/&gt; The 767MR/LR was eventually dropped in favor of standardizing around the twinjet configuration,&lt;ref name=norris_p18/&gt; and the 767-100 was ultimately not offered for sale, as its capacity was too close to the 757's.&lt;ref name=airliners.net_767-200&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.airliners.net/aircraft-data/stats.main?id=103 |title=The Boeing 767-200 |publisher=Airliners.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 14, 1978, the Boeing 767 was officially launched by [[United Airlines]], which placed an order for 30 767-200s, followed later that year with orders from [[American Airlines]] and [[Delta Air Lines]].&lt;ref name=norris_p18/&gt;

===Design effort===
The Boeing 767 design phase occurred at the same time as the 757, its narrow-body sibling.&lt;ref name=norris_p18/&gt; Development occurred in partnership with Italy's [[Aeritalia]] along with a consortium of Japanese aerospace companies.&lt;ref name=norris_p18/&gt; Both the 757 and 767 became the first Boeing jetliners to share common flight decks and handling characteristics.&lt;ref name=norris_p18/&gt; The aircraft was also the first Boeing jetliner after the 737 to be designed with a two-crew cockpit.&lt;ref name=norris_p18/&gt; The 767 was intended to be operated with a two-person flight crew, with electronics to assist with the monitoring of systems. As a result of their shared flight deck design, after a short conversion course, pilots rated in the 757 would also be qualified to fly the 767 and vice versa. Both twinjets were further designed with similarly configured systems, shared instrumentation, [[avionics]], and [[flight management system]]s.&lt;ref name=norris_p18/&gt;

For the 767 design, Boeing incorporated the engines that were available then on the 747, namely the [[Pratt &amp; Whitney JT9D]] and [[General Electric CF6]],&lt;ref name=Eden_p102/&gt; with wings sized to match. The 767 was the first Boeing jetliner to offer a choice of engines at its launch.&lt;ref name=norris_p18/&gt; The wings were large relative to fuselage size and provided higher-altitude cruise performance, along with capacity for possible stretched variants.&lt;ref name=Eden_p102/&gt; Moreover, the larger wings increased fuel usage slightly and provided better takeoff and landing performance. The 767 wings had increased thickness for added fuel capacity, and their aft-loaded design produced the best spanwise distribution of lift on a Boeing jetliner to date.&lt;ref name=norris_p18/&gt; The basic 767 was designed with enough range to fly across [[North America]] or across the [[northern Atlantic]].&lt;ref name=Sutter_p241&gt;{{harvnb|Sutter|2006|pp=241–246}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 767's fuselage width was set at {{convert|15|ft|6|in|m}}, midway between Boeing narrow-bodies and the 747. It was narrower than previous wide-body designs but produced less drag, thus increasing overall range.&lt;ref name=Eden_p102/&gt; Seating capacity was set at a seven-abreast cross-section, enabling Boeing to taper the rear fuselage over a shorter length, and allowing parallel aisles for the entire length of the passenger cabin.&lt;ref name=norris_p18/&gt; However, the fuselage width did not accommodate typical wide-body cargo hold units,&lt;ref name=Haenggi_p29&gt;Haenggi 2003, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; necessitating a smaller container design.&lt;ref name=767_airport_report&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.boeing.com/commercial/airports/acaps/767.pdf |title=767 Airplane Characteristics for Airport Planning |publisher=Boeing |date = June 2010|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Production and service===
[[File:All Nippon Airways B767-281 JA8245 NGO 02072010.jpg|thumb|[[All Nippon Airways]] was one of the first international 767-200 operators. |alt=An All Nippon Airways in blue and white livery during takeoff, with landing gears still down.]]

Construction of the prototype Boeing 767, a -200 variant, began on July 6, 1979.&lt;ref name=Eden_p102/&gt; Despite Boeing's two-person digital cockpit design, United Airlines initially demanded a conventional three-person crew with two pilots and a flight engineer. United's position was due to concerns about the risks associated with introducing a new aircraft.&lt;ref name=2crew/&gt; Boeing tried to convince United and others to adopt its new cockpit design with data from the two-person crew Boeing 737. In 1981, a U.S. Presidential task force studied the safety of operations with two crew on wide-body aircraft, and compared its capabilities to three-person configurations. The task force determined that a crew of two was safe for flight in July 1981, which paved the way for acceptance of the 767's two-person flight deck.&lt;ref name=2crew&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.boeing.com/commercial/767family/pf/pf_fltdeck.html |title=History Of The 767 Two-Crew Flight Deck |publisher=Boeing |accessdate=January 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Becher|1999|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; One airline, [[Ansett Australia]], ordered 767-200s with a three-person flight deck, due to union demands. These were the only 767s fitted as such.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilson|2002|p= 117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first 767, [[aircraft registration|registered]] N767BA and equipped with Pratt &amp; Whitney JT9D turbofans, rolled out on August 4, 1981.&lt;ref name=Shaw_twins&gt;{{harvnb|Shaw|1999|page = 64}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aircraft took its [[maiden flight]] on September 26, 1981.&lt;ref name=Eden_p102/&gt; Enlisted for the 767 flight test program, the first four aircraft built were equipped with JT9D engines, while the fifth and sixth aircraft were fitted with General Electric CF6-80A turbofans.&lt;ref name=Eden_p102/&gt; The sixth airframe was used in route-proving flights.&lt;ref name=Eden_p102/&gt; Following the successful completion of flight testing, the JT9D-powered 767-200 received [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) certification on July 30, 1982.&lt;ref name=Eden_p102/&gt; The first 767 with a two-person [[Cockpit (aviation)|flight deck]] completed its maiden flight on May 27, 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Becher|1999|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CF6-80A-powered 767-200 was certified by the FAA on September 30, 1982.&lt;ref name=Eden_p102/&gt;

Following the first delivery to United Airlines in August 1982, the 767-200 entered airliner service on September 8, 1982, with its first flight from Chicago to Denver.&lt;ref name=Eden_p102/&gt;&lt;ref name=Haenggi_p31-5&gt;{{harvnb|Haenggi|2003|pp=31–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Delta Air Lines commenced service with the CF6-powered 767-200 on December 15 of the same year.&lt;ref name=Eden_p102/&gt; Deliveries to mainline U.S. carriers American and [[TWA]] followed.&lt;ref name=haenggi_p38&gt;{{harvnb|Haenggi|2003|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 767's service introduction was relatively smooth, with few technical issues, and greater operational reliability than prior aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1983/1983%20-%200561.html |title=Boeing 767 moves smoothly into service|last=Lynn|first=Norman |date=April 2, 1983|work=Flight International |accessdate=January 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 767 received early international orders from [[Air Canada]], [[All Nippon Airways]], [[Ansett Australia]], [[Britannia Airways]], [[Egyptair]], [[El Al]], [[Ethiopian Airlines]], and [[Transbrasil]].&lt;ref name=haenggi_p38/&gt; The 767 was approved for U.S. [[Instrument landing system|CAT IIIb]] instrument landing operation in March 1984. This revision permitted operations with minimums as low as RVR 300 (Runway Visual Range 300 meters). The 767 was the first aircraft certificated for CAT IIIb by the FAA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://fsims.faa.gov/wdocs/8900.1/v04%20ac%20equip%20&amp;%20auth/chapter%2002/04_002_001.htm |title=FAA Order 8900.1 Flight Standards Information Management System (FSIMS), Volume 4  Aircraft Equipment And Operational Authorizations |publisher=FAA |date=September 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A key issue in early Boeing 767 operations was proving the aircraft's reliability for overseas operations. Prior to the 767, the FAA restricted twin-engine aircraft to over-water flights of 90 minutes or less distance from diversion airports.&lt;ref name=haenggi_p38-40&gt;{{harvnb|Haenggi|2003|pp=38–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1985, the FAA granted approval for 120-minute Extended-range Twin-engine Operational Performance Standards ([[ETOPS]]) to 767 operators, on an individual airline basis, provided the operator met flight safety standards.&lt;ref name=haenggi_p38-40/&gt; The increased safety margin changes were permitted due to the improved reliability demonstrated by the 767's turbofan engines.&lt;ref name=haenggi_p38-40/&gt; The FAA lengthened the ETOPS time to 180 minutes for GE-powered 767s in 1989, making the twinjet the first aircraft to be certified under the longer duration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=The Pioneer of Extended Operations (ETOPS) |publisher=Boeing |url=http://www.boeing.com/commercial/767family/back/back5.html |accessdate=January 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approvals for the other 767 engines were obtained by 1993. ETOPS allowed for much expansion of transatlantic flights by twin-engine airliners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Becher|1999|pp= 150, 154–155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Further developments===

Boeing developed the higher gross weight 767-200ER (Extended Range) variant, the lengthened 767-300, and the longer range 767-300ER in the 1980s.&lt;ref name=Birtles_1999_p26-7&gt;Birtles 1999, pp. 26–27.&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1980s, Boeing proposed a stretched version of the 767 and then a partial double-deck version with parts of a 757 fuselage built over the rear fuselage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.aiaa.org/sections/cl/what/mckinzie.htm |title=How United Airlines Helped Design The World's Most Remarkable Airliner |publisher=AIAA|last=McKinzie|first=Gordon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Norris_Wagner_777_p11-13&gt;{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|pages= 11–13, 15}} ''&quot;The proposal was referred to by at least one airline as the &quot;Hunchback of Mukilteo&quot;, after a town neighboring the Everett assembly plant.&quot;''&lt;/ref&gt; These concepts were not accepted, and Boeing shifted to an all-new airliner that later became the [[Boeing 777|777]].&lt;ref name=Norris_Wagner_777_p11-13/&gt; Boeing developed a freighter model, the 767-300F, in the mid-1990s, and another stretched passenger version, the 767-400ER, in the late 1990s.&lt;ref name=Birtles_1999_p113-5&gt;Birtles 1999, 113–115.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=airliners.net_767-400&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.airliners.net/aircraft-data/stats.main?id=105 |title=Boeing 767-400 |publisher=Airliners.net |accessdate=January 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 767 sold very well from the late 1980s to the late 1990s, with a decrease during the recession of the early 1990s. During this time it became very popular as the most common airliner used for transatlantic operations between North America and Europe.&lt;ref name=airl_777&gt;{{harvnb|Smil|1998|p= 28}}&lt;/ref&gt; After strong sales in 1997, sales have declined significantly because of the economic recession of the early 2000s, increased competition from [[Airbus]], and the recent emergence of a direct replacement program, the [[Boeing 787 Dreamliner|787]]. In early 2007, orders were placed by [[UPS Airlines]] for 27 767-300Fs and [[DHL]] for 6 767-300Fs to extend production.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release |url=http://www.boeing.com/news/releases/2007/q1/070215c_nr.html |title=Boeing and UPS Finalize Major 767 Freighter Order |publisher=Boeing |date= February 15, 2007 |accessdate= January 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release |url=http://www.boeing.com/news/releases/2007/q1/070308a_nr.html |title=Boeing to Supply Six 767 Freighters to Re-fleet DHL U.S. Operations |publisher=Boeing |date=March 8, 2007 |accessdate= January 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boeing had received 24 net orders for the 767 in 2008, but only 7 in 2009 and 3 in 2010.&lt;ref name=Boeing_yearly_orders&gt;[http://active.boeing.com/commercial/orders/index.cfm?content=displaystandardreport.cfm&amp;RequestTimeout=500&amp;optReportType=AnnOrd&amp;pageid=m15521 Annual Orders Summary].

The renewed interest in the 767-300F has Boeing considering enhanced versions of the 767-200 and 767-300F, with increased gross weights, 767-400ER wing technology, and 777-200 avionics. Boeing sees the advanced 767-200F and 767-300F proposals as complementing the 777F, and allowing Boeing to compete more effectively against the Airbus A330-200F, which is larger than the proposed 767-200F and 767-300F, but smaller than the 777F.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://atwonline.com/aircraftenginescomponents/news/boeing-considering-new-767-freighter-counter-a330-200f-0309 |title=Boeing considering new 767 freighter to counter A330-200F |publisher=ATW Online |date=March 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Airframe===
The Boeing 767 is a low-wing cantilever [[monoplane]] with a conventional tail unit with a single fin and rudder. The wings are swept at 31.5°, slightly more than the 757, and optimized for a [[Cruise (flight)|cruising speed]] of Mach 0.8.&lt;ref name=norris_p18/&gt; Power is provided by two wing-mounted [[Turbofan#High-bypass turbofan|high-bypass turbofan]] engines. The 767 has a retractable [[Tricycle gear|tricycle landing gear]] with four wheels on each main gear and two for the nose gear. The wing and gear design of the -200 accommodated the later stretched -300 configuration without major changes.&lt;ref name=norris_p18/&gt; For the 767-400ER, the same general landing gear configuration was used, but with a larger main gear in a more widely spaced configuration using 777 wheels, tires, and brakes; a retractable tail skid was also added.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1999|pp=119, 121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flight systems===
The original 767 cockpit design, shared with the 757, uses six [[Rockwell Collins]] [[cathode ray tube]] (CRT) screens to display electronic flight instrumentation.&lt;ref name=norris_p18/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Birtles|1999|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The displays are used for electronic flight instrumentation system (EFIS) and Engine Indication and Crew Alerting System (EICAS) information, taking over the former role of the flight engineer.&lt;ref name=norris_p18/&gt; From its introduction, the 767 was equipped with an [[Autoland|automatic landing]] system for low-visibility conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://airchive.com/html/memorabilia/boeing/1979-boeing-767-launch-brochure/8138 |title=Boeing 767 Launch Brochure |year=1979 |accessdate=January 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Young, David (June 17, 1982). &quot;767's maiden O'Hare landing is automatic&quot;.

The 767 features a twin-aisle cabin with a typical configuration of 2&amp;ndash;3&amp;ndash;2 in economy class and 2&amp;ndash;2&amp;ndash;2 in business class.&lt;ref name=767_airport_report/&gt; In the 2&amp;ndash;3&amp;ndash;2 layout, every passenger is no more than one seat from the aisle,&lt;ref name=kane553/&gt; allowing for faster entry/exit and meal service. This seven-abreast layout also places 87% of all seats at a window or aisle,&lt;ref name=kane553&gt;{{harvnb|Kane|2002|pp=553}}&lt;/ref&gt; accommodating passenger requests, and the seat-to-aisle ratio of 3.5 seats is less than other jetliners' four to six economy seats per aisle. On the 767 it is possible to squeeze an extra seat for a 2&amp;ndash;4&amp;ndash;2 configuration,&lt;ref name=767_airport_report/&gt; however this seating is cramped and therefore uncommon.&lt;ref name=Haenggi_p34&gt;{{harvnb|Haenggi|2003|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At its debut, the 767 cabin incorporated new design features intended to enhance on-board convenience. The overhead bins were larger than on previous aircraft, sized to accommodate [[garment bag]]s without folding, and strengthened for heavier carry-on items.&lt;ref name=reshaped&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B02E3D61438F937A15756C0A967948260&amp;sec=travel&amp;pagewanted=all |title=How Airline Cabins are being Reshaped |work=New York Times |date=May 24, 1981 |last=Pace |first=Eric |accessdate=February 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; More lavatories per passenger were offered than previous models, including in the center cabin,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Birtles|1999|p=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; in consideration of an estimated four-hour average flight time for early 767s.&lt;ref name=reshaped/&gt; A single large economy [[Galley (kitchen)|galley]] was installed near the aft doors on both the 767 and 757, allowing for faster meal service and ground loading.&lt;ref name=reshaped/&gt;

There are three basic variants of the 767, differing in fuselage length,&lt;ref name=767_airport_report/&gt; which were launched on three separate occasions. The 767-200 was the original variant launched in 1978, followed by the 767-300 in 1982, and the 767-400ER in 1997.&lt;ref name=eden_p105&gt;{{harvnb|Eden|2009|pp=104–05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Extended-range models, the 767-200ER and 767-300ER, were launched in 1982 and 1984, respectively.&lt;ref name=eden_p105/&gt; Freighter versions of the -200 and -300 variants have also been developed.

===767-200===
The first model of the Boeing 767 family, the 767-200, was launched in 1978 and entered service with [[United Airlines]] in 1982.&lt;ref name=Eden_p102/&gt; Initial customers also included Delta Air Lines and American Airlines, with the model used primarily by mainline U.S. carriers for domestic continental routes between major hub centers,&lt;ref name=Eden_p102/&gt; including flights from New York City to Los Angeles. The 767-200 typically is outfitted with 181 seats in a 3-class layout or 224 in a 2-class layout. All standard -200 models have a capacity limit of 255 due to exit-door limitations. An additional exit door could be specified when the aircraft was ordered to allow for up to 290 seats in a high-capacity, all-economy 2–4–2 layout.&lt;ref name=767_airport_report/&gt;

Some 767-200s were later converted to the -200ER specification.&lt;ref name=Eden_p102/&gt; Boeing proposed a conversion of -200s into Special Freighters in 1998 to replace aging DC-8 freighters and conversion work began later that year.&lt;ref name=Birtles_p114&gt;{{Harvnb|Birtles|1999|p=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Israel Aerospace Industries]] holds a supplemental type certificate for conversion of 767-200s to -200SFs since 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://easa.europa.eu/certification/type-certificates/docs/supplemental/EASA-TCDS-AS.00632_(IM)_IAI_B767--200SF_(Special_Freighter_Conversion)-03-23022011.pdf |title=Supplemental Type-Certificate Data Sheet |publisher=European Aviation Safety Agency |date= February 23, 2011 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deliveries for the -200 have totaled 128 aircraft with no unfilled orders remaining.&lt;ref name=767_O_D_summ/&gt; A total of 156 767-200/-200ER/-200SF aircraft were in airline service as of July 2010.&lt;ref name=Flight_2010/&gt;&lt;!-- Updates require a newer reference. --&gt; Its main competition was the [[Airbus A300]] and [[Airbus A310|A310]].&lt;ref name=Becher_p175&gt;{{Harvnb|Becher|1999|p=175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The extended-range variant of the original Boeing 767, the 767-200ER, was first delivered to [[El Al]] in 1984. The 767-200ER became popular overseas with smaller operators seeking wide-body airliners but not needing the 747's capacity.&lt;ref name=Eden_p102/&gt; This model became the first 767 to complete a nonstop transatlantic journey, and broke the flying distance record for a twinjet airliner on April 17, 1988, with an [[Air Mauritius]] 767-200ER flying {{convert|8727|nmi|km}} between [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax, Nova Scotia]] and [[Port Louis, Mauritius]].&lt;ref name=Eden_p102/&gt;

===767-300ER===

The 767-300ER is the extended-range version of the -300. It first flew in 1986 and received its first commercial orders when American Airlines purchased several in 1987. The aircraft entered service with AA in 1988. In 1995, [[EVA Air]] used a 767-300ER to inaugurate the first transpacific 767 service. The -300ER is the most popular variant of the 767 in airline service. Total deliveries for the 767-300ER stand at 548 with 24 remaining unfilled orders as of April 2011.&lt;ref name=767_O_D_summ/&gt;

===767-400ER===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Boeing 747]] --&gt;

The 767-400ER is the final extended variant and was first offered for sale by Boeing in January 1997. It was first ordered in March 1997 by [[Delta Air Lines]] to replace its remaining [[Lockheed L-1011]]s. [[Continental Airlines]] followed in June 1997 with a -400ER order&lt;ref name=Birtles_p114/&gt; to replace its [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10|DC-10]] fleet. The new 767 variant was developed after Boeing ended work on the proposed [[Boeing 777#Further developments|777-100X]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Becher|1999|p=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other airlines also placed orders, but these were eventually canceled or converted to other Boeing models.&lt;ref name=Flug767-400/&gt;

The 767-400ER is a major development over the 767-300. The -400ER was stretched {{convert|21.1|ft|m|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} from the -300 for a total length of {{convert|201.4|ft|m|abbr=on|sigfig=3}}. It also featured a new glass cockpit, redesigned wings with a wingspan increase of {{convert|14.3|ft|m|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} over the previous two variants, and redesigned landing gear. Additionally, larger passenger windows from the 777, and new Boeing Signature passenger cabin were included. The -400ER is the only 767 variant to also feature [[raked wingtips]] for increased fuel efficiency. This variant is only available as the 767-400ER, as there was no 767-400 variant. The 767-400ER has less range than the other two ER variants; a longer-range version, the [[#767-400ERX|767-400ERX]], was offered for sale in 2000, but canceled in 2001. The 767-400ER's first flight was on October 9, 1999,&lt;ref name=Fraw_civil_767-400&gt;Frawley, Gerald. &quot;Boeing 767-400ER&quot;. ''The International Directory of Civil Aircraft, 2003/2004''.

Versions of the 767 serve prominently in a number of military applications. Most military 767s are derived from the 767-200ER.

*'''Airborne Surveillance Testbed''' – the Airborne Optical Adjunct (AOA) was built in 1987 from the prototype 767-200, and later renamed the Airborne Surveillance Testbed (AST). Modifications to the aircraft included a large &quot;[[cupola]]&quot; or hump which ran along the top of the aircraft from above the cockpit to just behind the trailing edge of the wings. Inside the cupola was a suite of infrared seekers that were used to track theater ballistic missile launches in a series of tests.&lt;ref name=Becher_p183-4&gt;{{Harvnb|Becher|1999|pp=183–84}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release |url=http://www.boeing.com/news/releases/1998/news_release_981124a.html |title= Boeing Airborne Surveillance Testbed Tracks Missiles With New Seeker |publisher= Boeing |date= November 24, 1998 |accessdate= January 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; After test flights the aircraft was stored at the [[Southern California Logistics Airport|Victorville Airport]] in California in 2003,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.globalsecurity.org/space/systems/ast.htm |title= Airborne Surveillance Test Bed (AST) |work= Globalsecurity.org |accessdate= February 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ultimately deregistered in 2007&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://registry.faa.gov/aircraftinquiry/NNum_Results.aspx?NNumbertxt=N767BA |title= FAA Registry - Aircraft - N767BA |work= registry.faa.gov |accessdate= February 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; before scrapping.

*'''[[Boeing E-767|E-767]]''' – [[Airborne Early Warning and Control|AWACS]] platform used by the [[Japan Self-Defense Forces]]; it is essentially the [[E-3 Sentry]] mission package on a 767-200ER platform.

*'''[[Boeing KC-767#International programs|KC-767 Tanker Transport]]''' – a 767-200ER-based aerial refueling platform has been ordered by the Italian [[Aeronautica Militare]], and the [[Japan Self-Defense Forces]]. The JASDF has received all four KC-767Js ordered. The Aeronautica Militare received the first of its four KC-767As in January 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Kington |first=Tom |url=http://www.defensenews.com/story.php?i=5559911&amp;c=EUR&amp;s=AIR |title= Italian Air Force Receives 1st Tanker From Boeing |publisher=Defense News |date= January 27, 2011 |accessdate= January 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Undeveloped variants===
====767-400ERX====
Boeing offered a longer range version of the 767-400ER, named 767-400ERX for sale in 2000. It was introduced along with the [[Boeing 747-8#Background|Boeing 747X]] and was to be powered by 747X engines ([[Engine Alliance]] GP7172 and [[Rolls-Royce plc|Rolls Royce]] Trent 600). The -400ERX offered an increased maximum takeoff weight of {{convert|465000|lb|kg|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} and range of {{convert|6150|nmi|km|abbr=on|sigfig=3}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.boeing.com/news/releases/2000/news_release_000726b.html |title= The Newest Boeing 767 Is Inspired by the Future |author=Boeing |publisher= Boeing |date= July 26, 2000 |accessdate= September 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kenya Airways]] provisionally ordered three -400ERXs to supplement their 767 fleet. However, in 2001 Boeing canceled -400ERX development. Kenya Airways converted their order to the [[Boeing 777|777-200ER]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Wallace |first=James |url=http://www.seattlepi.com/business/62830_kenya19.shtml |title=Kenya Airways sticks to Boeing |work=Seattle Post-Intelligencer |date=March 19, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====E-10 MC2A====
The [[Northrop Grumman E-10 MC2A]] was to be a 767-400ER-based replacement for the USAF's [[Boeing 707]]-based [[E-3 Sentry]] [[airborne early warning and control]] (AWACS), [[E-8 Joint STARS]], and [[Boeing RC-135|RC-135]] [[SIGINT]] aircraft. This included an all-new system, with a powerful [[Active Electronically Scanned Array]] and was not based on the Japanese E-767 AWACS aircraft. One 767-400ER aircraft was produced as a testbed for systems integration. But the program was canceled and the prototype was sold to Bahrain as a VIP transport in January 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Sarsfield |first=Kate |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2009/01/27/321681/bahrain-acquires-767-400er-testbed-for-vip-use.html |title=Bahrain acquires 767-400ER testbed for VIP use |work=Flight International |date=January 27, 2009 |accessdate=January 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Notable incidents and accidents only --&gt;

As of January 2011, the 767 has been in 41 incidents,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://aviation-safety.net/database/dblist.php?Type=106 |title=Boeing 767 incidents |publisher=Aviation-Safety.net |accessdate=January 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; including 11 [[Aviation accidents and incidents|hull-loss accidents]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://aviation-safety.net/database/dblist.php?field=typecode&amp;var=106%&amp;cat=%1&amp;sorteer=datekey&amp;page=1resulting |title=Boeing 767 hull-losses |publisher=Aviation-Safety.net |date=January 13, 2011 |accessdate=January 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in 569 total fatalities.&lt;ref name=aviation-safety_767_stats/&gt; The type's first fatal crash, [[Lauda Air Flight 004]], occurred on May 26, 1991, following the in-flight deployment of the left engine thrust reverser on a 767-300ER; none of the 223 aboard survived, and as a result of this accident all 767 engine thrust reversers were deactivated until a redesign was implemented.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=James |first=Barry |author-link=Barry James |title=U.S. Orders Thrust Reversers Deactivated on 767s |newspaper= New York Times |date=August 17, 1991 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1991/08/17/news/17iht-thru.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 31, 1999, [[EgyptAir Flight 990]], a 767-300ER, crashed off [[Nantucket Island]], [[Massachusetts]], in [[international waters]] killing all 217 people on board;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Accident description |publisher=Aviation-safety.net |date=July 27, 2004|url=http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19991031-0 |accessdate=19 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; the probable cause was determined by the [[NTSB]] to be flying of the aircraft into the water by the first officer, but Egypt disputed this conclusion. On April 15, 2002, [[Air China Flight 129]], a 767-200ER, from Beijing to [[Busan]], South Korea, [[controlled flight into terrain|crashed into a hill]] while trying to land at [[Gimhae International Airport]], during inclement weather. The crash resulted in the death of 129 of the 166 people on board, and the cause was attributed to pilot error.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Accident description |publisher=Aviation-safety.net |date=August 27, 2005|url=http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=20020415-0 |accessdate=January 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two 767s were involved in the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001, attacks]] on the [[World Trade Center]], resulting in the collapse of its two main towers. [[American Airlines Flight 11]], a 767-200ER, crashed into the north tower, killing all 92 people on board, and [[United Airlines Flight 175]], a 767-200, crashed into the south tower, with the death of all 65 on board. In addition, over 2,600 people perished in the towers or on the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/23/world/threats-responses-excerpts-report-sept-11-commission-unity-purpose.html?pagewanted=all |title= Threats and Responses; Excerpts from the Report of the Sept. 11 Commission: 'A Unity of Purpose' |work= New York Times |date= July 23, 2004 |accessdate= January 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two notable 767 incidents were survived by all on board. On July 23, 1983, [[Gimli Glider|Air Canada Flight 143]], a 767-200, ran out of fuel in-flight and had to glide with both engines out almost {{convert|50|mi|km|abbr=out|sigfig=2}} to an emergency landing. The pilots used the aircraft's [[ram air turbine]] to power the hydraulic systems for aerodynamic control. There were no fatalities and only minor injuries. This aircraft was nicknamed &quot;Gimli Glider&quot; for the [[Gimli, Manitoba|airport]] at which it landed. The aircraft, registered C-GAUN, continued service within Air Canada until its retirement in January 2008.&lt;ref name=Air_Canada_Boe_767_Fleet&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.yyznews.com/767.html |title=Air Canada Boeing 767 Fleet List |publisher=yyznews.com |accessdate=February 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 22, 2001, [[Richard Reid (shoe bomber)|Richard C.

==Retirement and display==
[[File:The Spirit of Delta Boeing 767-200.jpg|thumb|&quot;The Spirit of Delta&quot; retired 767-200 in restoration hangar|alt=]]

As new 767s roll off the assembly line, older models have been retired and scrapped. Some aging 767 models, exceeding 20 years in age, were kept in service in the 2010s past planned retirement dates following delays of replacement aircraft such as the 787.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.heraldsun.com.au/business/ageing-jets-to-fly-on-due-to-delay-in-boeing-dreamliner/story-e6frfh4f-1225991529905 |title=Ageing jets to fly on due to delay in Boeing Dreamliner |work=Herald Sun |accessdate=January 19, 2011 |date=January 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; One aircraft is known to have been retained for exhibition, specifically the first 767-200 to operate for Delta Air Lines, N102DA.

'''William Ernest &quot;Bill&quot; Walsh''' (November 30, 1931 – July 30, 2007) was a head coach for the [[San Francisco 49ers]] and [[Stanford Cardinal football|Stanford Cardinal football team]], during which time he popularized the [[West Coast offense]].

Walsh went 102–63–1 with the 49ers, winning ten of his 14 postseason games along with six division titles, three [[NFC Championship Game|NFC Championship]] titles, and three [[Super Bowls]]. He was named the NFL's Coach of the Year in 1981 and 1984. In 1993, he was elected to the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]].

==Early career==
Born in [[Los Angeles]], Walsh started his career in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] as a running back for [[Hayward High School]] in [[Hayward, California|Hayward]].&lt;ref name = &quot;semtyh&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/07/30/BAG57LR8OK21.DTL | title=Former 49er head coach Bill Walsh dies | author= Tom Fitzgerald | publisher=''San Francisco Chronicle'' | date=2007-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Walsh attended [[College of San Mateo]] for two years as a [[quarterback]]. He then transferred to [[San José State University]], where he played as a [[tight end]] and a [[defensive end]]. He also participated in intercollegiate [[boxing]]. Walsh graduated from San Jose State with a [[bachelor's degree]] in [[physical education]] in 1955. He served under [[Bob Bronzan]] as a graduate assistant coach on the [[San José State Spartans|Spartans]] football coaching staff and graduated with a [[master's degree]] in physical education from San Jose State in 1959.&lt;ref name=&quot;SJS legend&quot;&gt;{{cite press release |title=San Jose State Legend Bill Walsh Dies |publisher=[[San Jose State University]] |date=July 30, 2007 |url=http://www.wacsports.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=10100&amp;ATCLID=1139580  |accessdate=2007-10-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His master's [[thesis]] was entitled ''Flank Formation Football -- Stress:: Defense''. Thesis 796.W228f&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.mercurynews.com/billwalsh/ci_6505664 | title=Coaching legend Bill Walsh dies at 75 | author=Daniel Brown, Jon Wilner and Mack Lundstrom | date=July 31, 2007 | work=[[San Jose Mercury News]] | accessdate=2007-10-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Following graduation, Walsh coached at [[Washington High School (Fremont, California)|Washington High School]] in [[Fremont, California|Fremont]], leading the football and swim teams. 

Walsh was coaching in Fremont when he interviewed for an assistant coaching position with [[Marv Levy]], who had just been hired as the head coach at the [[California Golden Bears football|University of California, Berkeley]]. 

&quot;I was very impressed, individually, by his knowledge, by his intelligence, by his personality and hired him,&quot; Levy said. 

After Cal, he did a stint at [[Stanford Cardinal football|Stanford]] as an assistant coach, before beginning his pro coaching career.

==Professional football career==
Walsh began his pro coaching career in [[1966 AFL season|1966]] as an assistant with the [[American Football League|AFL]]'s [[Oakland Raiders]]. As a Raider assistant, Walsh was trained in the vertical passing offense favored by [[Al Davis]], putting Walsh in Davis' mentor [[Sid Gillman]]'s coaching tree. Walsh would later modify his own offensive philosophy to favor a predominantly horizontal passing approach.

He then moved to the AFL expansion [[Cincinnati Bengals]] in [[1968 AFL season|1968]], serving under [[Paul Brown]] for eight seasons as one of the architects of the team's offense, built around [[quarterback]] [[Ken Anderson (quarterback)|Ken Anderson]] and [[wide receiver]] [[Isaac Curtis]]. 

When Brown retired as head coach following the [[1975 NFL season|1975]] season and appointed [[Bill &quot;Tiger&quot; Johnson]] as his successor, Walsh resigned and served as an assistant coach for [[Tommy Prothro]] with the [[San Diego Chargers]] in [[1976 NFL season|1976]]. In a 2006 interview,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Sam Farmer | title=Living Legend | publisher=''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' | date=December 22, 2006 | page=D1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Walsh claimed that during his tenure with the Bengals, Brown &quot;worked against my candidacy&quot; to be a head coach anywhere in the league. &quot;All the way through I had opportunities, and I never knew about them,&quot; Walsh said. &quot;And then when I left him, he called whoever he thought was necessary to keep me out of the NFL.&quot;

In 1977, Walsh was hired as the head coach at [[Stanford Cardinal football|Stanford]] where he stayed for two seasons. His two Stanford teams went 9–3 in 1977 with a win in the [[Sun Bowl]], and 8–4 in 1978 with a win in the [[Bluebonnet Bowl]]; his notable players at Stanford included quarterbacks [[Guy Benjamin]] and [[Steve Dils]], wide receivers [[James Lofton]] and [[Ken Margerum]], and running back [[Darrin Nelson]]. Walsh was the [[Pacific-10 Conference|Pac-8 Conference]] Coach of the Year in 1977.

In [[1979 NFL season|1979]], Walsh was hired as head coach of the [[San Francisco 49ers]]. The long-suffering 49ers went 2–14 in [[1978 NFL Season|1978]], the season before Walsh's arrival and repeated the same dismal record in his first season. Walsh doubted his abilities to turn around such a miserable situation—but earlier in 1979, Walsh drafted quarterback [[Joe Montana]] from [[University of Notre Dame|Notre Dame]] in the third round. 

Walsh turned over the starting job to Montana in [[1980 NFL Season|1980]], when the 49ers improved to 6–10. San Francisco won its first championship in [[1981 NFL Season|1981]], just two years after winning two games.

Under Walsh the 49ers won [[Super Bowl]] championships in [[1981 NFL season|1981]], [[1984 NFL season|1984]] and [[1988 NFL season|1988]]. Walsh served as 49ers head coach for ten years, and during his tenure he and his coaching staff perfected the style of play known popularly as the [[West Coast offense]]. Walsh was nicknamed &quot;The Genius&quot; for both his innovative playcalling and design. Walsh would regularly script the first 10-15 plays to be run on offense before the start of each game.

In addition to drafting [[Joe Montana]], Walsh drafted [[Ronnie Lott]], [[Charles Haley]], and [[Jerry Rice]]. He also traded a 2nd and 4th round pick in the 1987 draft for [[Steve Young (American football)|Steve Young]]. His success with the 49ers was rewarded with his election to the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame|Professional Football Hall of Fame]] in 1993.

===1981 championship===
The [[1981 NFL season|1981]] season saw Walsh lead the 49ers to a [[Super Bowl]] championship; the team rose from the cellar to the top of the NFL in just two seasons. Four important wins during the 1981 season were two wins each over the [[St. Louis Rams|Los Angeles Rams]] and the [[Dallas Cowboys]]. The Rams were only one year removed from a [[Super Bowl XIV|Super Bowl]] appearance, and had dominated the series with the 49ers for nearly a decade. The 49ers' two wins over the Rams in 1981 marked the shift of dominance in favor of the 49ers that lasted until the late 1990s. 

In 1981, the 49ers blew out the Cowboys in week 6 of the regular season. On ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' that week, the 49ers' win was not included in the famous halftime highlights. Walsh felt that this was because the Cowboys were scheduled to play the Rams the next week in a rare Sunday night game and that showing the highlights of the 49ers' win would potentially hurt the game's ratings. However, Walsh used this as a motivating factor for his team, who felt they were disrespected.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book | author=Bill Walsh | title=The Score Takes Care of Itself: My Philosophy of Leadership | publisher=[[Penguin Group]] | year=2009 | page=169}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 49ers faced the Cowboys again that same season in the [[National Football Conference|NFC]] title game. The game was very close, and in the fourth quarter Walsh called a series of running plays as the 49ers marched down the field against the Cowboys prevent defense, which had been expecting the 49ers to mainly pass. The 49ers came from behind to win the game on Dwight Clark's memorable TD reception ([[The Catch (American football)|The Catch]]), propelling Walsh to his first Super Bowl. Walsh and the 49ers defeated [[Cincinnati Bengals|Cincinnati]] in the [[Super Bowl XVI|Super Bowl]], which was played in [[Pontiac, Michigan]]. Walsh would later write that the 49ers' two wins over the Rams showed a shift of power in their division, while the wins over the Cowboys showed a shift of power in the conference.

===Prominent assistant coaches===
Many of his assistant coaches went on to be head coaches, including [[George Seifert]], [[Mike Holmgren]], [[Mike Shanahan]], [[Ray Rhodes]], and [[Dennis Green]]. These coaches in turn have their own disciples who have utilized Walsh's West Coast system. Walsh was viewed as a strong advocate for African-American head coaches in the NFL and NCAA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://archive.profootballweekly.com/content/archives2001/features_2001/dickey_011402.asp | title=It’s past time | author=Glenn Dickey | publisher=''ProFootballWeekly.com'' | date=2002-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with Rhodes and Green, [[Tyrone Willingham]] became the head coach at Stanford, then later Notre Dame and Washington. One of Mike Shanahan's assistants, [[Karl Dorrell]] went on to be the head coach at [[UCLA]], and is now the Wide Receiver's coach for the Miami Dolphins under up and coming Head Coach Tony Sparano. Walsh directly helped propel Dennis Green into the NFL head coaching ranks by offering to take on the head coaching job at Stanford.

===Bill Walsh coaching tree===
Many former and current NFL head coaches trace their lineage back to Bill Walsh on his [[coaching tree]], shown below.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://static.espn.go.com/nfl/s/westcoast/history.html | title=An offense by any other name ... | author=Len Pasquarelli | publisher=''ESPN.com'' | accessdate=2009-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Walsh, in turn, belonged to the coaching tree of [[American Football League]] great and Hall of Fame coach [[Sid Gillman]] of the AFL's [[San Diego Chargers|Los Angeles/San Diego Chargers]].

==Later career==
[[Image:Walsh and tomey.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Bill Walsh (left) with [[San Jose State Spartans]] head football coach [[Dick Tomey]].]]
After leaving the coaching ranks immediately following his team's victory in [[Super Bowl XXIII]], Walsh went to work as a broadcaster for [[NFL on NBC|NBC]] (teaming with [[Dick Enberg]] to form the lead broadcasting team while replacing [[Merlin Olsen]] in the booth). Walsh returned to Stanford in 1992 ([[Bob Trumpy]] subsequently replaced him on the NBC telecasts) once again serve as head coach for the school, leading the Cardinal to a 10-3 record and a [[Pacific-10 Conference]] co-championship. Stanford finished the season with an upset victory over [[Penn State]] in the [[Blockbuster Bowl]] on January 1, 1993 and a # 9 ranking in the final [[AP Poll]]. After consecutive losing seasons, Walsh left Stanford in 1994 and retired from coaching.

Walsh would also return to the 49ers, serving as Vice President and General Manager from [[1999 San Francisco 49ers season|1999]] to [[2001 San Francisco 49ers season|2001]] and was a special consultant to the team for three years afterwards. In 2004, Walsh was appointed as special assistant to the athletic director at Stanford. In 2005, after then-athletic director [[Ted Leland]] stepped down to take a position at the [[University of the Pacific (United States)|University of the Pacific]], Walsh was named interim athletic director. He also acted as a consultant for his alma mater [[San Jose State University]] in their search for an Athletic Director and Head Football Coach in 2005. 

Bill Walsh was also the author of three books, a motivational speaker, and taught classes at the [[Stanford Graduate School of Business]].

==Illness==

A '''utility knife''' (also known as a '''Stanley knife''', '''boxcutter''', '''X-Acto knife''', or by various other [[#Names|names]]) is a cutting [[tool]] used in various trades and crafts for a variety of purposes. Designed to be lightweight and easy to carry and use, utility knives are commonly used in [[factory|factories]], warehouses, and other situations where a tool is routinely needed to open boxes, packages, or cut through tape or cord.

==Names==
In [[British English|British]], [[Australian English|Australian]] and [[New Zealand English]], along with [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and [[Austrian German]], the tool is known as a '''Stanley knife'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stanley knife|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/246899?rskey=n8ldno&amp;result=1&amp;isAdvanced=false#|work=Oxford English Dictionary|accessdate=21 March 2011|quote=A knife made by the Stanley Works; esp. a small utility knife with a very fine and sharp replaceable blade, typically used in do-it-yourself and craft work.}} ''Available online to subscribers and also in print''&lt;/ref&gt;  This name is a [[genericised trademark]] named after [[Stanley Works]], a manufacturer of such [[knife|knives]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stanleytools.com/default.asp?CATEGORY=RETRACTABLE&amp;TYPE=PRODUCT&amp;PARTNUMBER=10-099&amp;SDesc=6%26%2334%3B+Classic+99%26%23174%3B+Retractable+Utility+Knife Stanley Tools]&lt;/ref&gt; In Israel and Switzerland, these knives are known as ''Japanese knives''. In Brazil they are known as ''estiletes'' or ''cortadores Olfa'' (the latter, being another [[genericised trademark]]). In Portugal and Canada they are also known as ''[[X-Acto]]'' (yet another [[genericised trademark]]). In the Philippines, Italy, and Egypt, they are simply called ''cutter''. In general Spanish, they are known as ''cortaplumas'' (penknife); in Spain, Mexico, and Costa Rica, they are colloquially known as ''cutters''. Other names for the tool are ''box cutter'' or ''boxcutter'', ''razor blade knife'', ''razor knife'', ''carpet knife'', ''pen knife'', ''stationery knife'', ''sheetrock knife'',  or ''drywall knife''. Some of these names refer to a different kind of knife depending on the region. For example, in the mid-Atlantic US, the X-Acto name is likelier to evoke only a specific subset of these knives (the [[:File:X-Acto-knife.jpg|pencil-shaped hobby knife]]), which may explain why the &quot;utility knife&quot; name, with its specificity, is more common there for [[:File:Aaknife2.jpg|the larger type]]. Also, in this region, &quot;boxcutter&quot; usually evokes only a specific subset of these knives ([[:File:BoxCutter.jpg|the simpler type]] whose body consists only of a flat sleeve stamped from sheet steel), and &quot;pen knife&quot; usually evokes only a folding [[pocket knife]].

==Design==
Such a knife generally consists of a variation of a razor blade, and an inexpensive handle, of various types, as detailed below. 
===Retractable, with discrete non-snapping blades===
[[Image:Stanley knife 1.jpg|thumb|right|A Stanley 99E utility knife, fully retracted]]
[[Image:aaknife2.jpg|thumb|right|Disassembled utility knife, blade partly extended]]
The largest type is a retractable one, typically flat, approximately one inch (25&amp;nbsp;mm) wide and three to four inches (75 to 100&amp;nbsp;mm) long, and made of either [[die casting|die-cast metal]] or [[molding (process)|molded plastic]]. Some use standard [[razor]] blades, others specialized double-ended blades as in the illustration. The user can adjust how far the blade extends from the handle, so that, for example, the knife can be used to cut the tape sealing a package without damaging the contents of the package. When the blade becomes dull, it can be quickly reversed or switched for a new one. Spare or used blades are stored in the hollow handle of some models, and can be accessed by removing a screw and opening the handle.  Other models feature a quick-change mechanism that allows replacing the blade without tools, as well as a flip-out blade storage tray.

The blades for this type of utility knife come in both double- and single-ended versions, and are interchangeable with many, but not all, of the later copies. Specialized blades also exist for cutting string, linoleum, and other materials.

===Retractable, with snap-off blades===
[[File:Box-cutter.jpg|thumb|right|Segmented blade or &quot;snap-off blade&quot; utility knife]]
Another style is a snap-off utility knife that contains a long, segmented blade that slides out from it. As the endmost edge becomes dull, it can be broken off the remaining blade, exposing the next section, which is sharp and ready for use. The snapping is best accomplished with a pair of pliers, and the break occurs at the score lines, where the metal is thinnest. When all the individual segments are used, the knife may be thrown away, or, more often, refilled with a replacement blade. This design was introduced by Japanese manufacturer [[Olfa]] Corporation in 1956 as the world's first snap-off blade and was inspired from analyzing the sharp cutting edge produced when glass is broken and how pieces of a chocolate bar break into segments.

===Nonretractable (fixed blade), often smaller, with discrete blades===
[[Image:X-Acto-knife.jpg|thumb|right|Light-duty utility knife for handicrafts and model making. [[X-Acto]] No. 2 knife depicted, fitted with X-Acto No. 2 blade.]]
Fixed-blade versions, about the size of a pencil, are used for handicrafts and model making and are best suited for cutting thin, lightweight materials; the specialized handle and blade allowing for cuts requiring a high degree of precision and control.

===Retractable, smaller and simpler than the cast or molded types===
[[Image:BoxCutter.jpg|thumb|right|Inexpensive stamped steel and aluminum box cutter with disposable razor blade.]]
A style that is often used for cutting open boxes consists of a simple sleeve around a rectangular handle into which [[Razor#Other razors|single-edge razor blades]] can be inserted.  The sleeve slides up and down on the handle, holding the blade in place during use and covering the blade when not in use.  The blade holder is designed to expose just enough edge to cut through one layer of [[corrugated fiberboard]], to minimize chances of damaging contents of cardboard boxes.

==Use as weapons==
Although such knives are not usually regarded as [[weapon]]s, it has been suggested by United States government officials that &quot;box-cutter knives&quot; were used in the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks]] against the United States.  The exact design of the knives actually used is unclear. (See [[airport security repercussions due to the September 11 attacks]] for further discussion.)

They have also been used by minor criminals in muggings, and some schools ban their possession on school grounds. Former New York City mayor [[Rudy Giuliani]] initiated a campaign against the sale of box-cutter knives to young people in the 1990s.

On June 1, 2004, Japanese elementary school student, Satomi Mitarai, was [[Sasebo slashing|slashed to death]] with a segmented-type utility knife.

In Australia, it is illegal to sell a cutting implement such as a utility knife to anyone under 16 years of age, and proof of age is often demanded of purchasers.

Recently, in England, there have been plans to raise the age limit for purchasing knives, including utility knives, from 16 to 18, in an effort to tackle &quot;[[yobbo|yob culture]]&quot;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{About|the metal alloy}}
[[Image:NatarajaMET.JPG|thumb|300px|Bronze [[Chola]] statue of ''[[Nataraja]]'' from ''[[India]]'' at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], [[New York City]]]]

'''Bronze''' is a [[metal alloy]] consisting primarily of [[copper]], usually with [[tin]] as the main additive. It is hard and brittle, and it was particularly significant in antiquity, so much so that the [[Bronze Age]] was named after the metal.  However, since &quot;bronze&quot; is a somewhat imprecise term, and historical pieces have variable compositions, in particular with an unclear boundary with [[brass]], modern museum and scholarly descriptions of older objects increasingly use the more cautious and inclusive term &quot;[[copper alloy]]&quot; instead.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/term_details.aspx?scopeType=Terms&amp;scopeId=18864 British Museum, &quot;Scope Note&quot; for &quot;copper alloy&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;   

The word ''Bronze'' is believed to be cognate with the {{lang-it|bronzo}} and {{lang-de|brunst}}, perhaps ultimately taken from the [[Persian language|Persian]] word ''birinj'' (&quot;bronze&quot;) or possibly from the Latin name of the city of [[Brindisi]] (''aes Brundusinum''—Pliny).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=bronze Bronze] at the Online Etymological Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Image:Pu with openwork interlaced dragons design.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[China|Chinese]] pu vessel with interlaced [[Chinese dragon|dragon]] design, [[Spring and Autumn Period]] (722 BC-481 BC)]]

The discovery of bronze enabled people to create metal objects which were better than  previously possible. Tools, weapons, armor, and various [[building material]]s, like decorative tiles, made of bronze were harder and more durable than their stone and copper (&quot;[[Chalcolithic]]&quot;) predecessors. Initially bronze was made out of copper and [[arsenic]] to form [[arsenic bronze]]. It was only later that [[tin]] was used, becoming the sole type of bronze in the late 3rd millennium BC. Tin bronze was superior to arsenic bronze in that the alloying process itself could more easily be controlled (as tin was available as a metal) and the alloy was stronger and easier to cast. Also, [[Arsenic poisoning|unlike arsenic]], tin is not toxic.

The earliest tin-alloy bronzes date to the late 4th millennium BC in [[Susa]] ([[Iran]]) and some ancient sites in China, [[Luristan]] (Iran) and [[Mesopotamia]] ([[Iraq]]). 

Copper and tin [[ore]]s are rarely found together (exceptions include one ancient site in [[Thailand]] and one in Iran), so serious bronze work has always involved trade. In Europe, the major source for tin was [[Great Britain]]'s deposits of ore in [[Cornwall]], which were traded as far as [[Phoenicia]] in the Eastern [[Mediterranean]].

Though bronze is generally harder than [[wrought iron]], with [[Vickers hardness test|Vickers hardness]] of 60–258&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allaboutgemstones.com/metal_jewelry_bronze.html Precious Metals: Bronze Jewelry]&lt;/ref&gt; vs. 30–80,&lt;ref&gt;''Smithells Metals Reference Book'', 8th Edition, ch. 22&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Bronze Age]] gave way to the [[Iron Age]]; this happened because iron was easier to find and easier to process. Bronze was still used during the Iron Age, for example officers in the Roman army had bronze swords {{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} while foot soldiers had iron, but, for many purposes, the weaker wrought iron was found to be sufficiently strong. Archaeologists suspect that a serious disruption of the tin trade precipitated the transition. The population migrations around 1200–1100 BC reduced the shipping of tin around the Mediterranean (and from Great Britain), limiting supplies and raising prices.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.claytoncramer.com/unpublished/Iron2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; As ironworking improved, [[iron]] became cheaper; and as cultures advanced from wrought iron to forged iron, they learned how to make [[steel]], which is stronger than bronze and holds a sharper edge longer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.llnl.gov/tid/lof/documents/pdf/238547.pdf Ancient Blacksmiths, the Iron Age, Damascus Steels, and Modern Metallurgy]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition==
There are many different bronze alloys but modern bronze is typically 88% [[copper]] and 12% [[tin]].&lt;ref&gt;Knapp, Brian. (1996) ''Copper, Silver and Gold''. Reed Library, Australia.&lt;/ref&gt; '''Alpha bronze''' consists of the alpha [[solid solution]] of tin in copper. Alpha bronze alloys of 4–5% tin are used to make [[coin]]s, [[spring (device)|springs]], [[turbine]]s and [[blade]]s.  Historical &quot;bronzes&quot; are highly variable in composition, as most metalworkers probably used whatever scrap was to hand; the metal of the 12th century English [[Gloucester Candlestick]] is bronze containing a mixture of copper, zinc, tin, lead, nickel, iron, antimony, arsenic with an unusually large amount of silver - between 22.5% in the base and 5.76% in the pan below the candle. The proportions of this mixture may suggest that the candlestick was made from a hoard of old coins.  The [[Benin Bronzes]] are really brass, and the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] [[Baptismal font at St Bartholomew's Church, Liège]] is described as both bronze and brass.

'''Commercial bronze''' (90% copper and 10% zinc) and '''Architectural bronze''' (57% Copper, 3% Lead, 40% Zinc) are more properly  regarded as [[brass]] alloys because they contain [[zinc]] as the main alloying ingredient. They are commonly used in architectural applications.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.copper.org/applications/architecture/arch_dhb/copper_alloys/intro.html Copper alloys]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.copper.org/resources/properties/standard-designations/introduction.html CDA UNS Standard Designations for Wrought and Cast Copper and Copper Alloys: Introduction]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bismuth bronze]] is a bronze alloy with a composition of 52% copper, 30% nickel, 12% zinc, 5% lead, 1% bismuth. It is able to hold a good polish and so is sometimes used in light reflectors and mirrors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.southerncrossmetalrecyclers.com.au/scrap/bismuth-bronze.html Bismuth Bronze&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other bronze alloys include [[aluminum bronze]], [[phosphor bronze]], manganese bronze, [[bell metal]], [[arsenical bronze]], [[speculum metal]] and [[cymbal alloys]].

==Properties==
[[Image:Assorted bronze castings.JPG|thumb|upright|Assorted ancient bronze castings]]

Bronze is considerably less [[brittle]] than iron. Typically bronze only oxidizes superficially; once a copper oxide (eventually becoming copper carbonate) layer is formed, the underlying metal is protected from further corrosion. However, if copper chlorides are formed, a corrosion-mode called &quot;bronze disease&quot; will eventually completely destroy it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://proteus.brown.edu/greekpast/4867 Bronze Disease, Archaeologies of the Greek Past]&lt;/ref&gt; Copper-based [[alloy]]s have lower [[melting point]]s than steel or iron, and are more readily produced from their constituent metals. They are generally about 10 percent heavier than steel, although alloys using [[aluminum]] or [[silicon]] may be slightly less dense. Bronzes are softer and weaker than steel—bronze [[spring (device)|springs]], for example, are less stiff (and so store less energy) for the same bulk. Bronze resists [[corrosion]] (especially [[seawater corrosion]]) and [[metal fatigue]] more than steel and is also a better conductor of heat and electricity than most steels. The cost of copper-base alloys is generally higher than that of steels but lower than that of [[nickel]]-base alloys.

Copper and its alloys have a huge variety of uses that reflect their versatile physical, mechanical, and [[Chemical property|chemical properties]]. Some common examples are the high [[electrical conductivity]] of pure copper, the excellent [[deep drawing]] qualities of [[Casing (ammunition)|cartridge case]] brass, the low-friction properties of bearing bronze, the resonant qualities of bell bronze, and the resistance to corrosion by [[sea water]] of several bronze alloys.

The melting point of Bronze varies depending on the actual ratio of the alloy components and is about 950 °C.

Bronze is nonmagnetic.

==Uses==
[[Image:Early Ewer Iran.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Ewer]] from 7th century [[Iran]]. Cast, chased, and inlaid bronze. New York Metropolitan Museum of Art]]

Bronze was especially suitable for use in boat and ship fittings prior to the wide employment of [[stainless steel]] owing to its combination of toughness and resistance to salt water corrosion. Bronze is still commonly used in ship propellers and submerged bearings.

In the twentieth century, [[silicon]] was introduced as the primary alloying element, creating an alloy with wide application in industry and the major form used in contemporary [[statuary]]. Sculptors may prefer silicon bronze because of the ready availability of silicon bronze brazing rod, which allows color-matched repair of defects in castings. Aluminum is also used for the structural metal [[aluminum bronze]].

It is also widely used for cast [[bronze sculpture]]. Many common bronze alloys have the unusual and very desirable property of expanding slightly just before they set, thus filling in the finest details of a [[molding (process)|mold]]. Bronze parts are [[Toughness|tough]] and typically used for [[Bearing (mechanical)|bearings]], clips, [[electrical connector]]s and [[Spring (device)|springs]].

Spring bronze [[weatherstripping]] comes in rolls of thin sheets and is nailed or stapled to wood windows and doors. There are two types, flat and v-strip. It has been used for hundreds of years because it has low friction, seals well and is long lasting. It is used in [[building restoration]] and custom construction.

Bronze also has very low metal-on-metal [[friction]], which made it invaluable for the building of [[cannon]] where iron cannonballs would otherwise stick in the barrel.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} It is still widely used today for springs, bearings, bushings, automobile transmission pilot bearings, and similar fittings, and is particularly common in the bearings of small [[electric motor]]s. [[Phosphor bronze]] is particularly suited to precision-grade bearings and springs. It is also used in guitar and piano strings.

Unlike steel, bronze struck against a hard surface will not generate sparks, so it (along with [[beryllium copper]]) is used to make [[hammer]]s, [[mallet]]s, [[wrench]]es and other durable tools to be used in explosive atmospheres or in the presence of flammable vapors. 

Bronze is used to make [[bronze wool]] for woodworking applications where [[steel wool]] would discolor [[oak]].

===Bronze statues===
{{See also|Bronze sculpture}}
Indian Hindu artisans from the period of the [[Chola dynasty|Chola empire]] in [[Tamil Nadu]], used bronze to create intricate statues via the [[lost wax casting]] method with ornate detailing depicting the Gods of [[Hinduism]] mostly, but also the lifestyle of the period. The art form survives to this day, with many silpis, craftsmen, working in the areas of [[Swamimalai]] and [[Chennai]].

In antiquity other cultures also produced works of [[High culture|high art]] using bronze. For example: in Africa, the bronze heads of the [[Benin Empire|Kingdom of Benin]]; in Europe, Grecian bronzes typically of figures from [[Greek mythology]]; in [[east Asia]], Chinese bronzes of the [[Shang dynasty|Shang]] and [[Zhou dynasty]] — more often ceremonial vessels but including some figurine examples.

Bronze continues into modern times as one of the materials of choice for monumental statuary.

===Musical instruments===
Bronze is the most popular metal for top-quality [[bell (instrument)|bell]]s, particularly [[bell metal]], which is about 23% tin. 

Nearly all professional [[cymbal]]s are made from a bronze alloy. The alloy used in drum kit cymbal bronze is unique in the desired balance of durability and [[timbre]].

Modern cymbals consist of several types of bronze, the most common being [[B20 (bronze)|B20 bronze]], which is roughly 20% tin, 80% copper, with traces of silver. [[Zildjian]] and [[Sabian]] use this alloy for their professional lines. A Swiss company, [[Paiste]], uses a softer B8 bronze which is made from 8% tin and 92% copper in nearly all of their cymbals. [[Zildjian]] and [[Sabian]] use this metal too, in their budget priced cymbals.
 
As the tin content in a bell or cymbal rises, the timbre drops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Lothar|last=Von Falkenhausen|title=Suspended Music: Chime-Bells in the Culture of Bronze Age China|location=Berkeley and Los Angeles|publisher=University of California Press|year=1993|pages=106|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ve1h53NTNW0C&amp;pg=PA106&amp;lpg=PA106 | isbn=9780520073784}}&lt;/ref&gt; As well as B8 and B20, [[Meinl Percussion]] uses B10 (10% tin) and B12 (12% tin) alloys for cymbals, which have timbres roughly between B8 and B20.&lt;ref&gt;[http://meinlcymbals.com/products/4_is_more.html MEINL CYMBALS... INSPIRE: 4 IS MORE]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bronze is also used for the windings of steel strings of various [[String instrument|stringed instruments]] such as the [[double bass]], [[piano]], [[harpsichord]], and the [[guitar]], replacing former gut and nylon strings. Bronze strings are commonly reserved on pianoforte for the lower pitch tones, as they possess a superior sustain quality to that of high-tensile steel.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;McCreight, Tim. ''Metals technic: a collection of techniques for metalsmiths''. Brynmorgen Press, 1992. ISBN 0961598433&lt;/ref&gt;

Bronzes of various metallurgical properties are widely used in struck [[idiophones]] around the world, notably in [[South East Asia]], and most famously for the [[Javanese people|Javanese]] [[gamelan]] and other [[glockenspiel]]-like [[musical instrument]]s. The earliest bronze archeological finds in [[Indonesia]] date from 1–2 BCE, including flat plates probably suspended and struck by a wooden or bone mallet.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;LaPlantz, David. ''Jewelry - Metalwork 1991 Survey: Visions - Concepts - Communication'': S. LaPlantz: 1991. ISBN 0942002059&lt;/ref&gt;

Some companies are now making [[saxophone]]s from [[phosphor bronze]] (3.5 to 10% tin and up to 1% phosphorus content).

===Medals===

Bronze has been used in the manufacture of various types of [[medal]]s for centuries, and are known in contemporary times for being awarded to the second-runner up in sporting competitions and other events. The later usage was in part attributed to the choices of [[Gold]], [[Silver]] and Bronze to represent the first three [[Ages of Man]] in [[Greek mythology]]: the [[Golden Age]], when men lived among the gods; the [[Silver age]], where youth lasted a hundred years; and the [[Greek Heroic Age|Bronze Age]], the era of heroes, and was first adopted at the [[1904 Summer Olympics]]. At the 1896 event, silver was awarded to winners and bronze to runners-up, while at 1900 other prizes were given, not medals.

[[File:Beneluxkaartnw.jpg|thumb|right|270px]]
The '''Benelux''' is an economic union in [[Western Europe]] comprising three neighbouring countries, [[Belgium|'''Be'''lgium]], the [[Netherlands|'''Ne'''therlands]], and [[Luxembourg|'''Lux'''embourg]]. These countries are located in northwestern Europe between [[France]] and [[Germany]]. The Union's name is formed from the beginning of each country's name; it was possibly created for the [[European integration#Benelux|Benelux Customs Union]],&lt;ref&gt;''Revue de l'Institut International de Statistique'' (1947)  Vol. 15, No. 1/4. (page 43&lt;/ref&gt; although according to ''[[The Economist]]'' it was coined somewhat earlier, in August 1946, by that newspaper's correspondent in Belgium.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/world/europe/displaystory.cfm?story_id=11293544 Going Dutch]&lt;/ref&gt; It is now used in a more generic way to refer to the cultural, economic, and geographic grouping. 

In 1951, these countries joined West Germany, France, and Italy to form the [[European Coal and Steel Community]], the earliest version of the modern [[European Union]].

The main institutions of the Union are the Committee of Ministers, the Parliament, the Council of the Union, the Court of Justice, the Secretariat-General, the Organization for Intellectual Property.

The Benelux Secretary-General is located in [[Brussels]]. It is the central administrative pillar of the Benelux Economic Union. It handles the secretariat of the Committee of Ministers, the Council of Economic Union and the various committees and working parties. Moreover, it ensures the registry of the Benelux Court of Justice.

==Politics==
A [[Benelux Parliament]] (originally referred to as ''Interparliamentary Consultative Council'') was created in 1955. This [[parliamentary assembly]] is composed of 21 members of the Dutch parliament, 21 members of the Belgian national and regional parliaments, and 7 members of the Luxembourgish parliament.

In 1944, the three countries signed the [[London Customs Convention]], the treaty that established the [[Benelux Customs Union]]. Ratified in 1947, the treaty was in force from 1948 until being supplanted by the Benelux Economic Union. The treaty establishing the Benelux Economic Union (''Benelux Economische Unie/Union Économique Benelux'') was signed on February 3, 1958 and came into force on November 1, 1960 to promote the free movement of [[worker]]s, [[Capital (economics)|capital]], [[Service (economics)|service]]s, and [[good (economics)|good]]s in the region. Under the Treaty the Union implies the co-operation of economic, financial and social policies.

==Law==
The Benelux Economic Union involves an intergovernmental cooperation. Decisions are taken unanimously.

The unification of the law of the three Benelux countries is mainly achieved by regulations of its Committee of Ministers, that only bind the three states, but are not directly applicable in their internal legal orders. They only become legally valid after having been incorporated into national law. 

The Treaty establishing the Benelux Economic Union has provided the Committee of Ministers with the following legal instruments: decisions, conventions, recommendations and directives.

The Committee of Ministers can promulgate decisions in the fields for which it has competence - those fields are explicitly set down in the Union Treaty or the additional conventions. When the Committee of Ministers adopts a decision, it immediately becomes binding on the three governments. For a decision to be also applicable to the citizen, it must be transposed into national law.

The Union Treaty is not exhaustive. For this reason, Article 19 of the Treaty provides that the Committee of Ministers may conclude additional conventions. These therefore constitute extensions of the Union Treaty. They are submitted to the national parliaments for approval in keeping with the ratification procedure applied in each of the Member States. Thus, there is a large number of Benelux conventions in a wide range of subject matters.&lt;ref name=&quot;benelux-nutshell&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.benelux.be/en/bnl/bnl_instellingen.asp|title=Benelux in a nutshell|publisher=General Secretariat of the Benelux|accessdate=2008-02-03 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080118043116/http://www.benelux.be/en/bnl/bnl_instellingen.asp &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Approval of a recommendation by the Committee of Ministers is not legally binding, but rather a moral stance by the three governments. Recommendations are not devoid of any binding effect in that their approval implies an undertaking in view of their execution.

The Committee of Ministers can issue directives to the Council of Economic Union, the Committees, the General Secretariat and the joint services.

In 1965, the treaty establishing a '''Benelux Court of Justice''' was signed. It entered into force in 1975. The Court, composed of judges from the highest courts of the three States, has to guarantee the uniform interpretation of common legal rules. This [[international judicial institution]] is located in Brussels.

The Benelux is particularly active in the field of [[intellectual property]]. The three countries established a ''Benelux Trademarks Office'' and a ''Benelux Designs Office'', both situated in [[The Hague]]. In 2005, they concluded a treaty establishing a ''[[Benelux Office for Intellectual Property|Benelux Organization for Intellectual Property]]'' which replaced both offices upon its entry into force on September 1, 2006. This Organization is the official body for the registration of trademarks and designs in the Benelux. In addition, it offers the possibility to formally record the existence of ideas, concepts, designs, prototypes and the like.

==Geography, demographics and languages==
{{main|Geography of Belgium|Geography of the Netherlands|Geography of Luxembourg}}
{{main|Demographics of Belgium|Demographics of the Netherlands|Demographics of Luxembourg}}
[[File:Languages Benelux.PNG|right|thumb|380px|Minority languages, regional languages and dialects in the Benelux. Pink are [[Langues d'oïl]] (French), yellowish and orange are [[Low Franconian]] (Dutch), green are [[West Low Saxon|Low Saxon]], blue are [[Frisian languages|Frisian]], and [[maroon (color)|maroon]] are [[Central German]] dialects. [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and [[French language|French]] are the official languages of the Benelux and its institutions.]]

Out of the total of about 27.7 million people living in the member states, 22.61 million (82%) live in the [[Netherlands]] or the [[Flemish Region]], where [[Dutch language|Dutch]] is the sole official language (though [[Frisian languages|Frisian]] is an official language in [[Friesland]]). The officially [[French language|French-speaking]] [[Wallonia|Walloon Region]] has 3.5 million inhabitants (12.5%), while a majority of the [[Brussels-Capital Region]] (3.8%) —although officially bilingual French-Dutch— is also Francophone. [[Luxembourg]] (1.74%) is officially trilingual with [[Luxembourgish]] as a &quot;[[national language]]&quot;, the latter being a standardised [[High German]] dialect. Combined with the [[German-speaking Community of Belgium]], this adds up to an estimated 2% of native [[German language|German-speakers]].

Although it is not an official language of the Benelux and its institutions, Belgium and Luxembourg recognise [[German language|German]] as one of the official national languages. In [[Friesland]], in the north of the Netherlands, [[West Frisian language|Frisian]] is co-official with Dutch.

The Benelux region has a total population of about 27,725,734 and occupies an area of approximately {{convert|74640|km2|sqmi}}. Thus, the Benelux has a population density of 371/km² (958/sq mi).

==Sports==
In 2000, Belgium and the Netherlands jointly hosted the [[UEFA Euro 2000|UEFA European Championship]]. In June 2007, representatives of the three countries announced they would bid, as a single political entity, for the [[2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup bids|2018 FIFA World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=441938&amp;campaign=rss&amp;source=soccernet&amp;&amp;cc=5901 |title= Benelux countries launch 2018 World Cup bid |work= [[ESPN]] |date= June 27, 2007 |accessdate= 2007-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future==
The Treaty between the Benelux countries establishing the Benelux Economic Union was for a period of 50 years. During the following years and even more after the creation of the European Union, the Benelux cooperation focused on developing other fields of activity within a constantly changing international context.

At the end of the 50-year period, the governments of the three Benelux-countries considered that it was time for renewal, taking into account the new aspects of the Benelux-cooperation – such as security – and the new federal state structure in Belgium. 

Thus, the treaty establishing the Benelux Economic Union expired in 2010 and was replaced by a new legal framework (Treaty revising the Treaty establishing the Benelux Economic Union), which was signed on June 17, 2008. This renewed Treaty has been concluded for an undetermined duration.

The name of the ''Benelux economic union'' will change to ''Benelux union'' to reflect this broader scope.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.benelux.be/en/act/act_nieuwVerdrag.asp Benelux union]&lt;/ref&gt;

The main objectives of the treaty are the continuation and enlargement of the cooperation between the three member states within a larger European context. The renewed Treaty explicitly foresees the possibility for the Benelux-countries to cooperate with other European member States or regional cooperation structures of these countries.

The new Benelux cooperation focuses on three main topics: internal market and economic union, sustainability, justice and internal affairs.

The number of structures in the renewed Treaty has been reduced and thus simplified. Five Benelux institutions remain:
the Benelux Committee of Ministers, the Benelux Council, the Benelux Parliament, the Benelux Court of Justice, the Benelux Secretariat General. Beside these five institutions, the Benelux Organization for Intellectual Property is also present in this Treaty.

The '''''Boston Herald''''' is a [[daily newspaper]] that serves [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], United States, and its surrounding area. It was started in 1846 and is one of the oldest daily newspapers in the United States. It has been awarded eight [[Pulitzer Prize]]s in its history, including four for editorial writing and three for [[photography]].

==History==
The ''Herald''&lt;nowiki&gt;'s&lt;/nowiki&gt; history can be traced back through two lineages, the ''[[Boston Daily Advertiser|Daily Advertiser]]'' and the old ''Boston Herald'', and two media moguls, [[William Randolph Hearst]] and [[Rupert Murdoch]].

[[Image:Old Boston Herald Building.png|thumb|left|The old Herald headquarters at 255 Washington Street (built 1878)]]

===The Original ''Boston Herald''===
The original ''Boston Herald'' was founded in 1846 by a group of Boston printers jointly under the name of John A. French &amp; Company. The paper was published as a single two-sided sheet, selling for one cent. Its first editor, [[William O. Eaton]], just 22 years old, said &quot;The ''Herald'' will be independent in politics and religion; liberal, industrious, enterprising, critically concerned with literacy and dramatic matters, and diligent in its mission to report and analyze the news, local and global.&quot;

In 1847 the ''Boston Herald'' absorbed the Boston ''American Eagle'' and the Boston ''Daily Times''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = King | first = Moses | title =  King's Hand-book of Boston ...: Profusely Illustrated |  pages = 268–269| publisher = ''Moses King'' | location = Cambridge, Ma | year = 1881}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Boston Herald and Boston Journal''===
In October 1917, John H. Higgins, the publisher and treasurer of the Boston Herald&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'' &quot;James H. Higgins, Retired Publisher; Also Was Treasurer of Boston Herald for 10 Years After Merger With Traveler DIES AT CENTRAL VALLEY In 1917 He Bought ''[[The Boston Journal]]'' and Consolidated It With The Herald&quot;.  ''The New York Times'', page 13, [[August 1]], 1938.&lt;/ref&gt; bought out its next door neighbor ''[[The Boston Journal]]'' and created ''The Boston Herald and Boston Journal''&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'' &quot;Boston Papers Merged.; Herald Absorbs The Journal and Will Use the Joint Title&quot;. ''The New York Times'', page 12, October 6, 1917.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Boston Traveler''===
Even earlier than the ''Herald'', the weekly ''American Traveler'' was founded in 1825 as a bulletin for [[stagecoach]] listings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stanwood 1886 104&quot;&gt;{{Citation | last = Stanwood | first = Edward | title =  Boston Illustrated: Containing Full Descriptions of the City and Its Immediate Suburbs, Its Public Buildings and Institutions, Business Edifices, Parks and Avenues, Statues, Harbor and Islands, Etc., Etc. With Numerous Historical Allusions |  page = 104| publisher = ''Houghton, Mifflin and Co, The Riverside Press | year = 1886| location = Boston, Ma, New York, N.Y., Cambridge, Ma}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The ''Boston Evening Traveler''===
The ''Boston Evening Traveler'' was founded in 1845. The '' Boston Evening Traveler'' was the successor to the weekly ''American Traveler'' and the semi weekly ''Boston Traveler''.&lt;ref name=&quot;King 1881 267&quot;&gt;{{Citation | last = King | first = Moses | title =  King's Hand-book of Boston ...: Profusely Illustrated |  page = 267| publisher = ''Moses King'' | location = Cambridge, Ma | year = 1881}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1857 ''The Boston Atlas'', ''The Boston Chronicle'' and ''The Evening Telegraph'' were merged into ''The Traveler''.&lt;ref name=&quot;King 1881 267&quot;/&gt;

In 1912, the ''Herald'' acquired the ''Traveler'', continuing to publish both under their own names. After a newspaper strike in 1967, Herald-Traveler Corp. suspended the afternoon ''Traveler'' and absorbed the evening edition into the Herald to create the ''Boston Herald Traveler.''

===''The Boston Daily Advertiser''===
[[Image:Boston Advertiser Building.png|thumb|right| The old ''Boston Advertiser'' Building]]
The ''Boston Daily Advertiser'' was established in 1813 in Boston by [[Nathan Hale (journalist)|Nathan Hale]]. The paper grew to prominence throughout the 19th century, taking over other Boston area papers. In 1832 The Advertiser took over control of ''The Boston Patriot'', and then in 1840 it took over and absorbed ''The Boston Gazette''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title =  The Encyclopaedia Britannica: A Dictionary of Arts, Sciences, Literature and General Information |  volume = 19|  page = 567| publisher = ''Encyclopaedia Britannica'' | location = New York, NY | year = 1911}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paper was purchased by [[William Randolph Hearst]] in 1917. In 1920 the ''Advertiser'' was merged with ''The Boston Record'', initially the combined newspaper was called the ''Boston Advertiser'' however when the combined newspaper became an illustrated tabloid in 1921 it was renamed ''The Boston American''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Frederic | last = Hudson | title =  American Journalism, 1690-1940 | pages = 661–662| publisher = ''Routledge'' | location = New York, N.Y. | year = 2000 | ISBN=0415228948 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hearst Corp. continued using the name ''Advertiser'' for its Sunday paper until the early 1970s.

===''The Boston Record''===
On September 3, 1884 ''The Boston Evening Record'' was started by the ''Boston Advertiser'' as a campaign newspaper. The ''Record'' was so popular that it was made a permanent publication.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stanwood 1886 104&quot; /&gt;

===''The Boston American''===
In 1904, William Randolph Hearst began publishing his own newspaper in Boston called ''The American''. Hearst ultimately ended up purchasing the ''Daily Advertiser'' in 1917. By 1938, the ''Daily Advertiser'' had changed to the ''Daily Record'', and ''The American'' had become the ''Sunday Advertiser''. A third paper owned by Hearst, called the ''Afternoon Record'', which had been renamed the ''Evening American'', merged in 1961 with the ''Daily Record'' to form the ''Record American''. The ''Sunday Advertiser'' and ''Record American'' would ultimately be merged in 1972 into ''The Boston Herald Traveler'' a line of newspapers that stretched back to the old ''Boston Herald''.

===''The Boston Herald-Traveler''===
In 1946, Herald-Traveler Corporation acquired Boston radio station [[WEEI|WHDH]]. Two years later, WHDH-FM was licensed, and on November 26, 1957, [[WHDH-TV (defunct)|WHDH-TV]] made its début as an [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] affiliate on channel 5. In 1961, WHDH-TV's affiliation switched to [[CBS]]. Herald-Traveler Corp. operated for years under temporary authority from the [[Federal Communications Commission]] stemming from controversy over luncheon meetings the newspaper's chief executive had with an FCC commissioner during the original licensing process (Some Boston broadcast historians accuse the ''[[Boston Globe]]'' of being covertly behind the proceeding. The ''Herald Traveler'' was Republican in sympathies, and the ''Globe'' then had a firm policy of not endorsing political candidates.) The FCC ordered comparative hearings, and in 1969 a competing applicant, [[Boston Broadcasters, Inc.]] was granted a construction permit to replace WHDH-TV on channel 5. Herald-Traveler Corp. fought the decision in court—by this time, revenues from channel 5 were all but keeping the newspaper afloat—but its final appeal ran out in 1972, and on March 19 WHDH-TV was forced to surrender channel 5 to the new [[WCVB-TV]].

===''The Boston Herald-Traveler and Record American''===
Without a television station to subsidize the newspaper, the ''Herald Traveler'' was no longer able to remain in business, and the newspaper was sold to [[Hearst Corporation]], which published the rival all-day newspaper, the ''Record American''. The two papers were merged to become an all-day paper called the ''Boston Herald-Traveler and Record American'' in the morning and ''Record-American and Boston Herald Traveler'' in the afternoon. The first editions published under the new combined name were those of June 19, 1972. The afternoon edition was soon dropped and the unwieldy name shortened to ''Boston Herald American'', with the Sunday edition called the ''Sunday Herald Advertiser''. The ''Herald American'' was printed in [[broadsheet]] format, and failed to target a particular readership; where the ''Record-American'' had been a typical city [[tabloid]], the ''Herald-Traveler'' was a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] paper.

===Murdoch purchases ''The Herald American''===
The ''Herald American'' converted to [[tabloid]] format in September 1981, but Hearst faced steep declines in circulation and advertising. The company announced it would close the ''Herald American'' -- making Boston a one-newspaper town—on December 3, 1982. When the deadline came, Australian media baron [[Rupert Murdoch]] was negotiating to buy the paper and save it. He closed on the deal after 30 hours of talks with Hearst and newspaper unions—and five hours after Hearst had sent out notices to newsroom employees telling them they were terminated. The newspaper announced its own survival the next day with a full-page headline: &quot;You Bet We're Alive!&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;NEPA&quot;&gt;&quot;Purcell Toasts 25th Anniversary of Herald's Survival&quot;. [http://www.nepa.org/Bulletin%20Archives/NEPA_Bulletin_Dec07.pdf ''NEPA Bulletin''] (Boston, Mass.), December 2007, page 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Boston Herald'' once again===
Murdoch changed the paper's name back to the ''Boston Herald''. The ''Herald'' continued to grow, expanding its coverage and increasing its circulation until 2001, when nearly all newspapers fell victim to declining circulations and revenue.

===Independent ownership===
In February 1994, Murdoch's [[News Corporation]] was forced to sell the paper, in order that its subsidiary [[Fox Television Stations]] could legally consummate its purchase of [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] affiliate [[WFXT-TV|WFXT]] (Channel 25). [[Patrick J. Purcell]], who was the publisher of the ''Boston Herald'' and a former [[News Corporation]] executive, purchased the ''Herald'' and established it as an independent newspaper. Several years later, Purcell would give the ''Herald'' a suburban presence it never had by purchasing the money-losing [[Community Newspaper Company]] from [[Fidelity Investments]]. Although the companies merged under the banner of Herald Media, Inc., the suburban papers maintained their distinct editorial and marketing identity.

After years of operating profits at Community Newspaper and losses at the ''Herald'', Purcell in 2006 sold the suburban chain to newspaper conglomerate Liberty Group Publishing of Illinois, which soon after changed its name to [[GateHouse Media]]. The deal, which also saw GateHouse acquiring ''[[The Patriot Ledger]]'' and ''[[The Enterprise (Brockton)|The Enterprise]]'' in south suburban [[Quincy, Massachusetts|Quincy]] and [[Brockton, Massachusetts|Brockton]], netted $225 million for Purcell, who vowed to use the funds to clear the ''Herald''&lt;nowiki&gt;'s&lt;/nowiki&gt; debt and reinvest in the Paper.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Steve, and Robert Gavin.

''The Boston Globe'', May 6, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
The ''Herald'''s four [[Pulitzer Prizes]] for editorial writing, in 1924, 1927, 1949 and 1954, are among the most awarded to a single newspaper in the category. In 1957 [[Harry Trask]] was a young staff photographer at the ''Traveler'' when he was awarded a Pulitzer Prize for his photo sequence of the sinking of the [[SS Andrea Doria]] in July 1956.  ''Herald'' photographer [[Stanley Forman]] received two Pulitzer Prizes consecutively in 1976 and 1977, the first being a dramatic shot of a young child falling in mid-air from her mother's arms on the upper stories of a burning apartment building to the waiting arms of firefighters below, and the latter (known as &quot;The soiling of Old Glory&quot;) being of [[Ted Landsmark]], an [[African American]] city official, being beaten with an [[American flag]] during Boston's school [[busing]] crisis. In 2006 the ''Herald'' won two SABEW awards from [[The Society of American Business Editors and Writers]] for its breaking news coverage of the takeover of local company Gillette Co. and for overall excellence.&lt;ref&gt;Boston Herald staff, &quot;Herald named `best in business'&quot;.

'''George Herman Ruth, Jr.''' (February 6, 1895 – August 16, 1948), best known as '''&quot;Babe&quot; Ruth''' and nicknamed &quot;'''the Bambino'''&quot; and &quot;'''the Sultan of Swat'''&quot;, was an American [[Major League Baseball|Major League]] [[baseball]] player from 1914–1935. Ruth originally broke into the major leagues with the [[Boston Red Sox]] as a [[starting pitcher]], but after he was sold to the [[New York Yankees]] in 1919, he converted to a full-time [[right fielder]] and subsequently became one of the league's most prolific hitters. Ruth was a mainstay in the Yankees' lineup that won seven [[Pennant (sports)|pennants]] and four [[World Series]] titles during his tenure with the team. After a short stint with the [[Atlanta Braves|Boston Braves]] in 1935, Ruth retired. In 1936, Ruth became one of the first five players elected to the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Baseball Hall of Fame]].

Ruth has since become regarded as one of the greatest sports heroes in [[Culture of the United States|American culture]].&lt;ref name=&quot;msnbio&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761556917/babe_ruth.html|title=Babe Ruth|encyclopedia=[[Encarta]]|publisher=[[MSN.com]] |accessdate=October 22, 2008 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5kwKvQarW |archivedate=October 31, 2009|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has been named the greatest baseball player in history in various surveys and rankings, and his [[home run]] hitting prowess and charismatic personality made him a larger than life figure in the &quot;[[Roaring Twenties]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=baseballsport&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseballsport.org/babe-ruth/|title=Baseball Sport – Babe Ruth |publisher=Baseballsport.com |accessdate=October 22, 2008}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Off the field he was famous for his charity, but also was noted for his often reckless lifestyle. Ruth is credited with changing baseball itself. The popularity of the game exploded in the 1920s, largely due to his influence. Ruth ushered in the &quot;[[live-ball era]]&quot;, as his big swing led to escalating home run totals that not only excited fans, but helped baseball evolve from a low-scoring, speed-dominated game to a high-scoring power game.

In 1998, ''[[The Sporting News]]'' ranked Ruth number one on the list of &quot;Baseball's 100 Greatest Players&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;The Sporting News list of Baseball's Greatest Players&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, baseball fans named Ruth to the [[Major League Baseball All-Century Team]].&lt;ref name=baseballsport/&gt; In 1969, he was named baseball's Greatest Player Ever in a ballot commemorating the 100th anniversary of professional baseball. In 1993, the [[Associated Press]] reported that [[Muhammad Ali]] was tied with Babe Ruth as the most recognized athletes, out of over 800 dead or alive athletes, in America.  The study found that over 97% of Americans over 12 years of age identified both Ali and Ruth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Retton, Hammill most popular American athletes|last=Wilstein|first=Steve|agency=Associated Press|date=May 17, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[ESPN]], he was the first true American sports celebrity superstar whose fame transcended baseball.&lt;ref name=sportscentury&gt;{{cite web|first=Larry|last=Schwartz| title = Loveable Ruth was Everyone's Babe | url=http://espn.go.com/sportscentury/features/00016451.html | publisher = [[ESPN.com]]| accessdate = November 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1999 ESPN poll, he was ranked as the third-greatest US athlete of the century, behind [[Michael Jordan]] and Muhammad Ali.&lt;ref name=baseballsport/&gt;

Ruth was the first player to hit 60 home runs in one season (1927), setting the season record which stood until broken by [[Roger Maris]] in 1961. Ruth's lifetime total of {{nowrap|714 home}} runs at his retirement in 1935 was a record, until first surpassed by [[Hank Aaron]] in 1974. Unlike many power hitters, Ruth also hit for average: his .342 lifetime batting is tenth highest in baseball history, and in one season (1923) he hit .393, a Yankee record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Official New York Yankees/Major League Baseball Records|url = http://mlb.mlb.com/nyy/history/season_records.jsp|publisher = MLB.Com|accessdate = August 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His .690 career [[slugging percentage]] and 1.164 career [[on-base plus slugging]] (OPS) remain the Major League records.&lt;ref name=baseballsport/&gt; Ruth dominated the era in which he played. He led the league in home runs during a season twelve times, slugging percentage and OPS thirteen times each, runs scored eight times, and [[runs batted in]] (RBIs) six times. Each of those totals represents a modern record (as well as the all-time record, except for RBIs).&lt;ref name=brleaders&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/leaders/leaders_most_times.shtml |title=Most Times Leading League |publisher=[[Baseball-Reference.com]] |accessdate=October 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early years ==

Ruth was born at 216 Emory Street in [[Pigtown, Baltimore|Pigtown]], a rough neighborhood of [[Baltimore, Maryland]]. Ruth's [[German-American]] parents, Kate Schamberger-Ruth and George Herman Ruth, Sr., owned a succession of [[Bar (establishment)|saloons]] and sold [[lightning rod]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;otherprioritybook&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=The Life that Ruth Built|author=Marshall Smelser|publisher=Quadrangle/New York Times Book Co|isbn=0812905407|pages=5–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only one of Ruth's seven siblings, his sister Mamie, survived past infancy.&lt;ref&gt;Smelser: pp. 7–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:RuthStMary's.jpg|thumb|left|Ruth (top row, far left) at St Mary's Industrial School for Boys, Baltimore, Maryland, c. 1912]]

Not much is known about Ruth's early childhood.&lt;ref name=&quot;prioritybook&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=The Life and times of Babe Ruth|author=Leigh Montville|publisher=DoubleDay Books|isbn=9780385514378|pages=7–12}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother was constantly ill (she later died of [[tuberculosis]] while Ruth was still a teenager).&lt;ref&gt;Smelser: pp. 7, 9–10.&lt;/ref&gt; Ruth later described his early life as &quot;rough&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Montville p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; When he was seven years old, his father sent him to St. Mary's Industrial School for Boys, a [[reformatory]] and [[orphanage]], and signed custody over to the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[missionary|missionaries]] who ran the school (the site of St. Mary's was occupied by [[Cardinal Gibbons School]]).&lt;ref&gt;Montville: pp. 7–9.&lt;/ref&gt; Ruth remained at St. Mary's for the next 12 years, only visiting with his family for special occasions.&lt;ref&gt;Smelser: p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Brother Matthias Boutlier, the Head of Discipline at St. Mary's, first introduced Ruth to the game of baseball.&lt;ref&gt;Montville pp. 24–26.&lt;/ref&gt; He became a father figure in Ruth's life, teaching him how to read and write, and worked with Ruth on hitting, fielding and as his skills progressed, pitching.&lt;ref&gt;Smelser pp. 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt; During his time in St. Mary's, Ruth was also taught [[tailor]]ing, where he became a qualified shirtmaker and was a part of both the school band and the drama club.&lt;ref&gt;Smelser: pp. 17–18.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Baltimore Orioles ===

In 1913, St. Mary's Industrial School was playing a game against [[Mount St. Mary's University]] (then college) in [[Emmitsburg, Maryland]]. That day, the game was attended by [[Joe Engel]], a former Mount St. Mary's student who was now a pitcher for the [[Minnesota Twins|Washington Senators]].&lt;ref&gt;Montville pp. 33–34.&lt;/ref&gt; Impressed with Ruth's pitching abilities, Engel, along with a teacher at St. Mary's, Brother Gilbert, brought Ruth to the attention of [[Jack Dunn]], owner and manager of the then [[Minor League Baseball|minor-league]] [[Baltimore Orioles (minor league)|Baltimore Orioles]]. After watching Ruth pitch in a workout for half an hour, Dunn signed Ruth to a contract for $250 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|250|1913|r=-2}}}} in current dollar terms) a month on February 14, 1914.&lt;ref&gt;Montville pp. 34 – 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Since Ruth was only 19 years old, Dunn had to become Ruth's [[legal guardian]] as well; at that time, the [[age of majority]] was 25.{{citation needed|date=September 2010}} When the other players on the Orioles caught sight of Ruth, they nicknamed him &quot;Jack's newest babe&quot;.&lt;ref name=rotohog&gt;{{cite web|url=http://community.rotohog.com/columnists/professional-athletes-and-name-changes|title=Professional Athletes and Name Changes|publisher=[[RotoHog|RotoHog.com]]|accessdate=October 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reference stayed with Ruth the rest of his life, and he was most commonly referred to as Babe Ruth from then on.&lt;ref name=&quot;baberuth.com/biography&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title = Ruth biography | url=http://www.baberuth.com/flash/about/biograph.html | accessdate = October 24, 2006 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061004174314/http://www.baberuth.com/flash/about/biograph.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = October 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Babe&quot; was not a unique nickname (see e.g., [[Babe Adams]]). His teammates eschewed the public nickname &quot;Babe&quot;, and instead called him &quot;George&quot;; or &quot;Jidge&quot; (a nickname for George); or &quot;The Big Fellow&quot;; or just &quot;Bam&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Leigh Montville, ''The Big Bam'', 2006, Random House, p.310&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 7, 1914, Dunn offered to trade Ruth, along with [[Ernie Shore]] and [[Ben Egan]], to [[Connie Mack (baseball)|Connie Mack]] of the [[Oakland Athletics|Philadelphia Athletics]]. Dunn asked $10,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|10000|1914|r=-4}}}} in current dollar terms) for the trio, but Mack refused the offer.&lt;ref name=&quot;suspended&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Young Babe Ruth: His Early Life and Baseball Career, from the Memoirs of a Xaverian Brother|author=Harry Rothgerber|publisher=McFarland|isbn=0786406526 |pages=106–108}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Cincinnati Reds]], who had an agreement with the Orioles, also passed on Ruth.

== Major League career ==
=== Red Sox Years ===
[[File:Babe Ruth pitching.jpg|thumb|upright|Ruth pitching for the Red Sox in 1914, at [[Comiskey Park]] in Chicago]]

Ruth appeared in five games for the Red Sox in 1914, pitching in four of them. He picked up the victory in his major league debut on July 11.&lt;ref name=bleachreport&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/65041-a-tribute-tobabe-ruth|title=A Tribute To...Babe Ruth|publisher=bleacherreport.com|accessdate=October 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Red Sox had many star players in 1914, so Ruth was soon optioned to the minor league [[Providence Grays (minor league)|Providence Grays]] of [[Providence, Rhode Island]] for most of the remaining season. Behind Ruth and [[Carl Mays]], the Grays won the [[International League]] pennant.&lt;ref name=worldathletes&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldathletes.com/sports_biographies/Babe_Ruth.htm|title=Famous and historical sports figures|publisher=worldathletes.com|accessdate=October 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after the season, in which he'd finished with a 2–1 record, Ruth proposed to Helen Woodford, a waitress whom he had met in [[Boston]]. They were married in [[Ellicott City, Maryland]], on October 17, 1914.&lt;ref name=worldathletes/&gt;

During spring training in 1915, Ruth secured a spot in the Red Sox starting rotation. He joined a pitching staff that included [[Rube Foster (AL pitcher)|Rube Foster]], [[Dutch Leonard (left-handed pitcher)|Dutch Leonard]], and [[Smokey Joe Wood]]. Ruth won 18 games,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Creamer |first=Robert W. |authorlink=Robert Creamer |title=1900–1929 |accessdate= |edition=1st |series=SportsCentury|year=1999 |publisher=Rare Air Media|location=Chicago|isbn=1-892866-08-0|page=28 |chapter=Babe Ruth: Living Large}}&lt;/ref&gt; lost eight, and helped himself by hitting .315. He also hit his first four home runs. The Red Sox won 101 games that year on their way to a victory in the [[World Series]]. Ruth did not pitch in the series, and grounded out in his only at-bat.&lt;ref name=baseballsport/&gt;

In 1916, after a slightly shaky spring, he went 23–12, with a 1.75 ERA and nine shutouts, both of which led the league. On June 27, he struck out ten Philadelphia A's, a career high. On July 11, he started both games of a doubleheader, but the feat was not what it seemed; he only pitched one-third of an inning in the opener because the scheduled starter, Foster, had trouble getting loose. Ruth then pitched a complete-game victory in the nightcap. Ruth had unusual success against [[Minnesota Twins|Washington Senators]] star pitcher [[Walter Johnson]], beating him four times in 1916 alone, by scores of 5–1, 1–0, 1–0 in 13 innings, and 2–1. Johnson finally outlasted Ruth for an extra-inning 4–3 victory on September 12; in the years to come, Ruth would hit ten home runs off Johnson, including the only two Johnson would allow in 1918–1919. Ruth's nine shutouts in 1916 set an AL record for left-handers which would remain unmatched until [[Ron Guidry]] tied it in 1978.

Despite a weak offense, hurt by the sale of [[Tris Speaker]] to the [[Cleveland Indians|Indians]], the Red Sox made it to the World Series. They defeated the [[Brooklyn Dodgers|Brooklyn Robins]] four games to one. This time Ruth made a major contribution, pitching a 14-inning complete-game victory in Game Two.

[[File:Ruth1918.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Ruth batting in 1918]]

Ruth went 24–13 with a 2.01 ERA and six shutouts in 1917, and hit .325, but the Sox finished second, nine games behind the [[Chicago White Sox]]. On June 23 against the [[Minnesota Twins|Washington Senators]], after walking the leadoff hitter, Ruth erupted in anger, was ejected, and threw a punch at the [[umpire (baseball)|umpire]], which would result in a ten-game suspension. [[Ernie Shore]] came into the game in relief, the baserunner was out stealing, and Shore retired all twenty-six batters he faced, for which he was credited with a [[perfect game]] until the 1990s. Ruth's outburst was an example of self-discipline problems that plagued Ruth throughout his career, and is regarded as the primary reason (other than financial) that then-owner [[Harry Frazee]] was willing to sell him to the Yankees two years later.

The left-hander was pitching a no-hitter in a 0–0 game against the Detroit Tigers on July 11, before a single deflected off his glove in the eighth inning. Boston finally pushed across a run in the ninth, and Ruth held onto his 1–0 victory by striking out [[Ty Cobb]]. In 1942, Ruth called this game his greatest thrill on the field.

In 1918, Ruth pitched in 20 games, posting a 13–7 record with a 2.22 ERA. He was mostly used as an outfielder, and hit a league-leading eleven home runs. His statistics were curtailed slightly when he walked off the team in July following an argument with Boston's manager.

Ruth threw a 1–0 shutout in the opener of the [[1918 World Series]], then won Game Four in what would be his final World Series appearance as a pitcher. Ruth won both his starts, allowing two runs (both earned) in seventeen innings for an ERA of 1.06. Ruth extended his World Series consecutive scoreless inning streak to 29⅔ innings, a record that would last until [[Whitey Ford]] broke it in 1961.

=== Emergence as a hitter ===

In the years 1915–1917, Ruth had been used in just 44 games in which he had not pitched. After the 1917 season, in which he hit .325, albeit with limited at bats, teammate [[Harry Hooper]] suggested that Ruth might be more valuable in the lineup as an everyday player.

In 1918, he began playing in the outfield more and pitching less, making 75 hitting-only appearances. Former teammate [[Tris Speaker]] speculated that the move would shorten Ruth's career, though Ruth himself wanted to hit more and pitch less. In 1918, Ruth batted .300 and led the A.L. in home runs with eleven despite having only 317 at-bats, well below the total for an everyday player.

During the 1919 season, Ruth pitched in only 17 of his 130 games. He also set his first single-season home run record that year with 29, including a game-winning homer on a September &quot;Babe Ruth Day&quot; promotion. It was Babe Ruth's last season with the Red Sox.

=== Sold to New York ===
[[File:Ruth1920.jpg|upright|thumb|Ruth in 1920, the year he joined the [[New York Yankees|Yankees]]]]

Popular legend has it that Frazee sold Ruth and several other of his best players to finance a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] play, ''[[No, No, Nanette]]'' (which, though it actually didn't debut until 1925, did have origins in a December 1919 play, ''My Lady Friends'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Leigh|last=Montville|title=The Big Bam: The Life and Times of Babe Ruth|publisher=Random House|year=2006|pages=161–64}}&lt;/ref&gt; The truth is not so simple, as Frazee had another financial concern: Babe Ruth.

After the 1919 season, Ruth demanded a raise to $20,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|20000|1920|r=-4}}}} in current dollar terms)—double his previous salary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ruth Demands $20,000.; Business Manager Says Home-Run King Has Returned Contract.|newspaper=New York Times|date=December 25, 1919|accessdate=August 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Frazee refused, and Ruth responded by letting it be known he wouldn't play until he got his raise, suggesting that he may retire to undertake other profitable ventures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ruth Talks of Retiring; Can Make More Money Outside of Baseball, Says Home-Run King.|newspaper=New York Times|date=December 27, 1919|accessdate=August 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frazee finally lost patience with Ruth, and decided to trade him. However, he was effectively limited to two trading partners—the [[Chicago White Sox]] and the then-moribund Yankees. The other five clubs rejected his deals out of hand under pressure from American League president [[Ban Johnson]], who never liked Frazee and was actively trying to remove him from ownership of the Red Sox.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Frazee to Answer Johnson's Threat; Boston Owner Is Expected to Resent Proposal to Sell His Club. Feud Will Reach Climax, Issue May Renew Fight for Oneman Commission for the Two Major Leagues|newspaper=New York Times|date=December 16, 1918|accessdate=August 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The White Sox offered [[Shoeless Joe Jackson]] $60,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|60000|1920|r=-4}}}} in current dollar terms), but Yankees owners [[Jacob Ruppert]] and [[Tillinghast L'Hommedieu Huston]] offered an all-cash deal—$100,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|100000|1920|r=-4}}}} in current dollar terms).

Frazee, Ruppert and Huston quickly agreed to a deal. In exchange for Ruth, the Red Sox would get $125,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|.125000|1920|r=2}}}} million in current dollar terms) in cash and three $25,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|25000|1920|r=-4}}}} in current dollar terms) notes payable every year at 6 percent interest. Ruppert and Huston also loaned Frazee $300,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|.300000|1920|r=2}}}} million in current dollar terms), with the mortgage on [[Fenway Park]] as collateral. The deal was contingent on Ruth signing a new contract, which was quickly agreed to, and Ruth officially became property of the Yankees on December 26. The deal was announced ten days later.&lt;ref name=&quot;Year1920&quot;/&gt;

In the January 6, 1920 edition of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', Frazee described the transaction:
: &quot;I should have preferred to take players in exchange for Ruth, but no club could have given me the equivalent in men without wrecking itself, and so the deal had to be made on a cash basis. No other club could afford to give me the amount the Yankees have paid for him, and I don't mind saying I think they are taking a gamble. With this money the Boston club can now go into the market and buy other players and have a stronger and better team in all respects than we would have had if Ruth had remained with us.&quot;

However, the January 6, 1920 ''The New York Times'' was more prescient:
: &quot;The short right field wall at the [[Polo Grounds]] should prove an easy target for Ruth next season and, playing seventy-seven games at home, it would not be surprising if Ruth surpassed his home run record of twenty-nine circuit clouts next Summer.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Year1920&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Ruth Bought By New York Americans For $125,000, Highest Price In Baseball Annals|work=The New York Times|date=January 6, 1920|accessdate=March 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Yankee Years ===
==== 1920–1925 ====

After moving to the Yankees, Ruth's transition from a pitcher to a power-hitting outfielder became complete. In his fifteen year Yankee career, consisting of over 2,000 games, Ruth re-wrote the record books in terms of his hitting achievements, while making only five widely-scattered token appearances on the mound, winning all of them.

[[File:Ruth1921.jpg|thumb|left|Babe Ruth in 1921.]]

In 1920, his first year with the Yankees, Ruth hit 54 home runs and batted .376. His .847 slugging average was a Major League record until 2001. Aside from the Yankees, only the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] managed to hit more home runs as a team than Ruth did as an individual, slugging 64 in hitter-friendly [[Baker Bowl]].

In 1921, Ruth improved to arguably the best year of his career, hitting 59 home runs, batting .378 and slugging .846 (the highest with 500+ at-bats in an [[MLB]] season) while leading the Yankees to their first league championship. On July 18, 1921, Babe Ruth hit career home run #139, breaking [[Roger Connor]]'s record of 138 in just the eighth year of his career. (This was not recognized at the time, as Connor's correct career total was not accurately documented until the 1970s. Even if the record had been celebrated, it would have been on an earlier date, as Connor's total was at one time thought to be only 131.)

Ruth's name quickly became synonymous with the home run, as he led the transformation of baseball strategy from the &quot;inside game&quot; to the &quot;power game&quot;, and because of the style and manner in which he hit them. His ability to drive a significant number of his home runs in the 450–500&amp;nbsp;foot range and beyond resulted in the lasting adjective &quot;[[wikt:Ruthian|Ruthian]]&quot;, to describe any long home run hit by any player. Probably his deepest hit in official game play (and perhaps the longest home run by ''any'' player), occurred on July 18, at Detroit's [[Tiger Stadium (Detroit)|Navin Field]], in which he hit one to straightaway center, over the wall of the then-single-deck bleachers, and to the intersection, some {{convert|575|ft|m}} from home plate.

As impressive as Ruth's 1921 numbers were, they could have been more so under modern conditions. Bill Jenkinson's 2006 book, ''[[The Year Babe Ruth Hit 104 Home Runs]],'' attempts to examine each of Ruth's 714 career home runs, plus several hundred long inside-the-park drives and &quot;fair-foul&quot; balls. Until 1931 in the AL, balls that hit the [[foul ball|foul pole]] were considered [[ground-rule double]]s, and balls that went over the wall in fair territory but hooked foul were ruled foul. Many fields, including Ruth's home [[Polo Grounds]], had exceptionally deep center fields—in the Polo Grounds' case, nearly five hundred feet. The author concluded that Ruth would have been credited with 104 home runs in 1921, if modern rules and field dimensions were in place.  However, these claims ignore the extreme short distanes down the left and right field lines, which were 279 and 258 feet respectively.  In addition, the 21 foot overhang in left field often intercepted fly balls which would otherwise have been catchable and turned them into home runs.  In either case, Ruth set major league records in total bases (457), extra base hits (119) and times on base (379), all of which  stand to this day.

The Yankees had high expectations when they met the [[San Francisco Giants|New York Giants]] in the [[1921 World Series]], and the Yankees won the first two games with Ruth in the lineup. However, Ruth badly scraped his elbow during Game 2, sliding into third base (he had walked and stolen both second and third). After the game, he was told by the team [[physician]] not to play the rest of the series. Although he did play in Games 3, 4 and 5, and pinch-hit in Game 8 of the best-of-9 Series, his productivity was diminished, and the Yankees lost the series. Ruth hit .316, drove in five runs and hit his first World Series home run. (Although the Yankees won the fifth game, Ruth wrenched his knee and did not return to the Series until the eighth [last] game.)

Ruth's appearance in the 1921 World Series also led to a problem and triggered another disciplinary action. After the series, Ruth played in a [[barnstorm (athletics)|barnstorming]] tour. A rule then in force prohibited World Series participants from playing in exhibition games during the off-season, the purpose of which was to prevent Series participants from &quot;restaging&quot; the Series and undermining its value. [[Baseball Commissioner]] [[Kenesaw Mountain Landis]] suspended Ruth for the first six weeks of the 1922 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Levitt|first=Daniel R.|title=Ed Barrow: The Bulldog Who Built the Yankees' First Dynasty|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|year=2008|isbn=0803229747|page=194}}&lt;/ref&gt; Landis had made his point about adhering to the letter of the rules, but he also recognized that the rule was no longer needed, and rescinded it.

Despite his suspension, Ruth started his [[1922 in sports|1922 season]] on May 20 as the Yankees' new on-field captain. But five days later, he was ejected from a game for throwing dirt on an umpire, and then climbed into the stands to confront a heckler; Ruth was subsequently stripped of the captaincy. In his shortened season, Ruth appeared in 110 games, batted .315, with 35 home runs and drove in 99 runs, but compared to his previous two dominating seasons, the 1922 season was a disappointment for Ruth. Despite Ruth's off-year, Yankees managed to win the pennant to face the New York Giants for the second straight year in the World Series.   In the series, Giants manager John McGraw instructed his pitchers to throw Ruth nothing but curveballs, and Ruth never adjusted.  Ruth had just two hits in seventeen at-bats, and the Yankees lost to the Giants for the second straight year by 4–0 (with one tie game).

In 1923, the Yankees moved from the [[Polo Grounds]], where they had sublet from the Giants, to their new [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]], which was quickly dubbed &quot;The House That Ruth Built&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=9OwZAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=PyIEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5849,3821321&amp;dq=the-house-that-ruth-built|title=The Sport Parade|author=Henry McLemore|work=The Milwaukee Journal|date=April 20, 1934|accessdate=August 31, 2009}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ruth hit the stadium's first home run on the way to a Yankees victory over the Red Sox. Ruth finished the 1923 season with a career-high .393 batting average and major-league leading 41 home runs. For the third straight year, the Yankees faced the Giants in the World Series. Rebounding from his struggles in the previous two World Series, Ruth dominated the 1923 World Series. He batted .368, walked eight times, scored eight runs, hit three home runs and slugged 1.000 during the series, as the Yankees won their first World Series title, four games to two.

[[File:The Library of Congress - Ruth knocked out (LOC).jpg|thumb|Ruth after being knocked unconscious from running into a wall at [[Griffith Stadium]] on July 5, 1924.]] On July 5, 1924, Ruth was [[Unconsciousness|knocked unconscious]] after running into a wall during a game at [[Griffith Stadium]] against the [[Minnesota Twins|Washington Senators]]. Despite evident pain and a bruised pelvic bone, Ruth insisted on staying in the game and hit a double in his next at-bat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0B16FB3D5B12738DDDAF0894DF405B848EF1D3 “Yanks Break Even and Fail To Advance; Drop Second Game to Senators, 7-2, After Pennock Pitches Shut-Out in First, 2-0.”], ''The New York Times'', July 6, 1924. Retrieved April 3, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Ruth narrowly missed winning the Triple Crown in 1924. He hit .378 for his only American League batting title, led the major leagues with 46 home runs, and batted in 121 runs to finish second to [[Goose Goslin]]'s 129. Ruth's on-base percentage was .513, the fourth of five years in which his OBP exceeded .500. However, the Yankees finished second, two games behind the Washington Senators, who went on to win their only World Series while based in D.C. During that same year, Ruth served in the New York national Guard 104th Field Artillery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shorpy.com/node/1912|title=The Babe in Uniform: 1924|date=November 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During spring training in 1925 Ruth's ailment was dubbed &quot;the bellyache heard round the world,&quot; when one writer wrote that Ruth's illness was caused by binging on hot dogs and soda pop before a game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailyherald.com/story/?id=233980|title=Freak sports injuries: Now that's a bad break!|work=Daily Herald|author=Robert McCoppin|date=September 11, 2008|accessdate=August 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Venereal disease and alcohol poisoning (caused by tainted liquor, a major health problem during the [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]]) have also been speculated to be the causes of his illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=24cLAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=WFYDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5396,5306128|title='Pistol' fires airball|work=The Victoria Advocate|author=Douglas Rowe|date=August 25, 1991|accessdate=August 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the exact nature of his ailment has never been confirmed and remains a mystery. Playing just 98 games, Ruth had what would be his worst season as a Yankee as he finished the season with a .290 average and 25 home runs. The Yankees team finished next to last in the American League with a 69–85 mark, their last season with a losing record until 1965.

==== 1926–1928 ====
Babe Ruth performed at a much higher level during 1926, batting .372 with 47 home runs and 146 RBIs. The Yankees won the AL pennant and advanced to the World Series, where they were defeated by [[Rogers Hornsby]] and the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] in seven games. In Game 4, he hit three home runs, the first time any player achieved this in a World Series game. Despite his batting heroics, he is also remembered for a costly baserunning blunder. Ruth had a reputation as a good but overaggressive baserunner (he had 123 stolen bases, including ten steals of home, but only a 51% career percentage). With two outs in the bottom of the ninth inning of the decisive seventh game, with the Yankees trailing 3–2, Ruth tried to steal second base. However, he was thrown out by ten feet, ending the game and the Series. Barrow later called this the only on-field boner Ruth ever made in his career.

This remains the only time that the final out of a World Series was a &quot;caught stealing.&quot; The 1926 series was also known for Ruth's promise to [[Johnny Sylvester]], a seriously ill 11-year old, that he would hit a home run on his behalf.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Robert McG., Jr. [http://www.nytimes.com/1990/01/11/obituaries/johnny-sylvester-the-inspiration-for-babe-ruth-heroics-is-dead.html &quot;Johnny Sylvester, the Inspiration For Babe Ruth Heroics, Is Dead&quot;], ''The New York Times'', January 11, 1990. Retrieved June 28, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruth was the leader of the famous 1927 Yankees, also known as [[Murderer's Row]] because of the strength of its hitting lineup. The team won a then AL-record 110 games, a mark for a 154-game season surpassed by the 1954 Cleveland Indians (the 2001 [[Seattle Mariners]] now hold the record with 116 wins, though they played eight more games), took the AL pennant by 19 games, and swept the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] in the World Series.

With the race long since decided, the nation's attention turned to Ruth's pursuit of his own home run mark of 59. Early in the season, Ruth expressed doubts about his chances: &quot;I don't suppose I'll ever break that 1921 record. To do that, you've got to start early, and the pitchers have got to pitch to you. I don't start early, and the pitchers haven't really pitched to me in four seasons. I get more bad balls to hit than any other six men...and fewer good ones.&quot; Ruth was also being challenged for his slugger's crown by teammate [[Lou Gehrig]], who nudged ahead of Ruth's total in midseason, prompting the ''[[New York World-Telegram]]'' to anoint Gehrig the favorite. But Ruth caught Gehrig (who would finish with 47), and then had a remarkable last leg of the season, hitting 17 home runs in September. His 60th came on September 30, in the Yankees' next-to-last game. Ruth was exultant, shouting after the game, &quot;Sixty, count 'em, sixty! Let's see some son-of-a-bitch match that!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/al/yankees/2008-07-10-top-10-games_N.htm |title=Top 10 games in Yankee Stadium's rich history |author=Devin Clancy |work=USA Today |date=July 10, 2008 |accessdate=August 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In later years, he would give Gehrig some credit: &quot;Pitchers began pitching to me because if they passed me they still had Lou to contend with.&quot; In addition to his career-high 60 home runs, Ruth batted .356, drove in 164 runs and slugged .772.

[[File:1927NYYankees5.jpg|frame|left|The 1927 New York Yankees, one of the greatest baseball teams of all-time (Ruth is on top row, fifth from the left.)]]

The following [[1928 in sports|season]] started off well for the Yankees, who led the AL by 13 games in July. But the Yankees were soon plagued by some key injuries, erratic pitching and inconsistent play. The [[Philadelphia Athletics]], rebuilding after some lean years, erased the Yankees' big lead and even took over first place briefly in early September. The Yankees, however, took over first place for good when they beat the A's three out of four games in a pivotal series at Yankee Stadium later that month.

Ruth's play in 1928 mirrored his team's performance. He got off to a hot start and on August 1, he had 42 home runs. This put him ahead of his 60 home run pace from the previous season. But Ruth was hobbled by a bad ankle the latter part of the season, and he hit just twelve home runs in the last two months of the regular season. His batting average also fell to .323, well below his career average. Nevertheless, he ended the season with 54 home runs, which would be the fourth (and last) time he hit 50 home runs in a season.
[[Image:Babe Ruth &amp; Lou Gehrig at West Point 1927.jpg|thumb|Babe Ruth and [[Lou Gehrig]] at [[West Point, New York]], 1927.]]

The Yankees had a [[1928 World Series]] rematch with the St. Louis Cardinals, who had upset them in the 1926 series. The Cardinals had the same core players as the 1926 team, except for [[Rogers Hornsby]], who was traded for [[Frankie Frisch]] after the 1926 season. Ruth batted .625 (the second highest average in World Series history), including another three-home run game (in game 4), Gehrig batted .545, and the Yankees demolished the Cardinals in four games. The Yankees thus became the first major league team to sweep their opponents in consecutive World Series.

==== Decline and end with Yankees ====

In 1929, the Yankees failed to make the World Series for the first time in four years, and it would be another three years before they returned. Although the Yankees had slipped, Ruth led or tied for the league lead in home runs each year during 1929–1931. At one point during the 1930 season, as a stunt, Ruth was called upon to pitch for the first time since 1921, and he pitched a complete-game victory. (He had often pitched in exhibitions in the intervening years).

Also in 1929, the Yankees became the first team to use uniform numbers regularly (the [[Cleveland Indians]] had used them briefly in 1916). Since Ruth normally batted third in the order (ahead of Gehrig), he was assigned number 3 (to Gehrig's 4). The Yankees retired Ruth's number on June 13, 1948; however, it was kept in circulation prior to that.

[[File:Babe Ruth Gov.jpg|thumb|left|Babe Ruth and Al Smith]]
In 1930, which was not a pennant year for the Yankees, Ruth was asked by a reporter what he thought of his yearly salary of $80,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|.080000|1930|r=2}}}} million in current dollar terms) being more than President [[Herbert Hoover|Hoover's]] $75,000. His response: &quot;I know, but I had a better year than Hoover.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A52356-2004Sep26.html|title=Just a Little History|work=Washington Post|author=Norman Chad|date=September 27, 2004|accessdate=August 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; That quote has also been rendered as, &quot;How many home runs did ''he'' hit last year?&quot; (Ruth had supported [[Al Smith]] in the 1928 Presidential election, and snubbed an appearance with president Hoover.) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=http://books.google.com/?id=edUHzkxaA2gC&amp;pg=PA453&amp;lpg=PA453&amp;dq=babe+ruth+al+smith#v=onepage&amp;q=babe%20ruth%20al%20smith&amp;f=false| title=The big bam: the life and times of Babe Ruth| author=Leigh Montville| publisher=Random House, Inc.| year= 2006| isbn= 9780739326411 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gettyimages.com/detail/71989177/Getty-Images-Sport |title=Babe Ruth Votes for Al Smith (1928 campaign photo) |publisher=Getty Images |date= |accessdate=2010-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lelands.com/Auction/AuctionDetailed/37454 |title=Lot 514.

In the 1932 season, the Yankees went 107–47 and won the pennant under manager [[Joe McCarthy (manager)|Joe McCarthy]], as Ruth hit .341, with 41 home runs and 137 RBIs.

The Yankees faced [[Gabby Hartnett]]'s [[Chicago Cubs]] in the [[1932 World Series]]. The Yankees swept the Cubs and batted .313 as a team. During Game 3 of the series, after having already homered, Ruth hit what has now become known as [[Babe Ruth's Called Shot]]. During the at-bat, Ruth supposedly gestured to the deepest part of the park in center-field, predicting a home run. The ball he hit traveled past the flagpole to the right of the scoreboard and ended up in temporary bleachers just outside [[Wrigley Field]]'s outer wall. The center field corner was 440&amp;nbsp;feet away, and at age 37, Ruth had hit a straightaway center home run that was perhaps a 490&amp;nbsp;foot blow.&lt;ref&gt;as per Bill Jenkinson's book&lt;/ref&gt; It was Ruth's last Series homer (and his last Series hit), and it became one of the legendary moments of baseball history.

Ruth remained productive in 1933, as he batted .301, with 34 home runs, 103 RBIs, and a league-leading 114 walks. Elected to play in the first [[All-Star]] game, he hit the first home run in the game's history on July 6, 1933, at [[Comiskey Park]] in Chicago. His two-run home run helped the AL to a 4–2 victory over the NL, and Ruth made a fine catch in the game. Film footage of his All-Star game home run revealed the 38-year-old Ruth had become noticeably overweight.

Late in the 1933 season, he was called upon to pitch in one game and pitched a complete game victory, his final appearance as a pitcher. For the most part, his Yankee pitching appearances (five in fifteen years) were widely-advertised attempts to boost attendance. Despite unremarkable pitching numbers, Ruth had a 5–0 record in those five games, raising his career totals to 94–46.

In 1934, Babe Ruth recorded a .288 average, 22 home runs, and made the All-Star team for the second consecutive year. During the game, Ruth was the first of five consecutive strikeout victims (all of whom were future Hall of Fame players) of Giants pitcher [[Carl Hubbell]], perhaps the most famous pitching feat in All-Star game history. In what turned out to be his last game at Yankee Stadium, only about 2,000 fans attended. By this time, Ruth had reached a personal milestone of 700 home runs and was about ready to retire.

[[File:Babe Ruth and kids.jpg|thumb|Ruth with the baseball-kids in Japan in 1934]]

After the 1934 season, Ruth went on a baseball barnstorming tour in the [[Far East]]. Players such as [[Jimmie Foxx]], [[Lefty Gomez]], [[Earl Averill]], [[Charlie Gehringer]], and [[Lou Gehrig]] were among fourteen players who played a series of 22 games, with many of the games played in Japan. Ruth was popular in Japan, as baseball had been popular in Japan for decades. Riding in a motorcade, Ruth was greeted by thousands of cheering Japanese. The tour was considered a great success for further increasing the popularity of [[baseball in Japan]], and in 1936 Japan organized its first professional baseball league.

=== Sold to the Braves ===
By this time, Ruth knew he had little left as a player.  His heart was set on managing the Yankees, and he made no secret of his desire to replace McCarthy. However, Ruppert would not consider dumping McCarthy. The slugger and manager had never got along and Ruth's managerial ambitions further chilled their relations. Just before the 1934 season, Ruppert offered to make Ruth manager of the Yankees' top minor-league team, the [[Newark Bears (1926-1949)|Newark Bears]]. However, Ruth's wife, [[Claire Merritt Hodgson]] and business manager advised him to reject the offer.

After the 1934 season, the only teams that seriously considered hiring Ruth were the [[Oakland Athletics|Philadelphia Athletics]] and [[Detroit Tigers]].  A's owner/manager [[Connie Mack (baseball)|Connie Mack]] gave some thought to stepping down as manager in favor of Ruth, but later dropped the idea, saying that Ruth's wife would be running the team in a month if Ruth ever took over.  Ruth was in serious negotiations with Tigers owner [[Frank Navin]], but missed a scheduled interview in late 1934.  Meanwhile, Ruppert negotiated with other major-league clubs, seeking one that would take Ruth either as a manager or player.

[[Atlanta Braves|Boston Braves]] owner [[Emil Fuchs (baseball)|Emil Fuchs]] finally agreed to take Ruth. Even though the Braves had fielded fairly competitive teams in the last three seasons, Fuchs was sinking in debt and couldn't afford the rent on [[Braves Field]]. Fuchs thought Ruth was just what the Braves needed, both on and off the field.

After a series of phone calls, letters and meetings, the Yankees traded Ruth to the Braves on February 26, 1935. It was announced that in addition to remaining as a player, Ruth would become team vice president and would be consulted on all club transactions. He was also made assistant manager to Braves skipper [[Bill McKechnie]]. In a long letter to Ruth a few days before the press conference, Fuchs promised Ruth a share in the Braves' profits, with the possibility of becoming co-owner of the team. Fuchs also raised the possibility of Ruth becoming the Braves' manager, perhaps as early as 1936.

Amid much media hoopla, Ruth played his first home game in Boston in over 16 years. Before an opening-day crowd of over 25,000, Ruth accounted for all of the Braves' runs in a 4–2 defeat of the [[San Francisco Giants|New York Giants]]. The Braves had long played second fiddle to the Red Sox in Boston, but Ruth's arrival spiked interest in the Braves to levels not seen since their stunning win in the [[1914 World Series]].

That win proved to be the only time the Braves were over .500 that year. By May 20, they were 7–17, and their season was effectively over. While Ruth could still hit, he could do little else, and soon stopped hitting as well. His conditioning had deteriorated so much that he could do little more than trot around the bases. His fielding was dreadful; at one point, three of the Braves' pitchers threatened not to take the mound if Ruth was in the lineup. Ruth was also annoyed that McKechnie ignored most of his managerial advice (McKechnie later said that Ruth's presence made enforcing discipline nearly impossible). He soon discovered that he was vice president and assistant manager in name only, and Fuchs' promise of a share of team profits was also hot air. In fact, Fuchs expected Ruth to invest some of ''his'' money in the team.

On May 25, at [[Forbes Field]] in [[Pittsburgh]], Ruth went 4-for-4, drove in 6 runs and hit 3 home runs in an 11–7 loss to the Pirates. These were the last three home runs of his career. His last home run cleared the roof at the old Forbes Field—he became the first player to accomplish that feat. Five days later, in [[Philadelphia]], Ruth played in his last Major League game. He struck out in the first inning and, while playing the field in the same inning, hurt his knee and left the game. In the 1948 film [[The Babe Ruth Story]] there was a more dramatic recounting of Ruth's last game. The Braves were depicted as winning the game against The Pirates and learning he had been fired for walking off the field during the game, while still in the locker room.

Two days after that, Ruth summoned reporters to the locker room after a game against the Giants and announced he was retiring. He had wanted to retire as early as May 12, but Fuchs persuaded him to stay on because the Braves hadn't played in every National League park yet. That season, he hit just .181 with six home runs in 72 at-bats. The Braves season went as badly as Ruth's short season. They finished 38–115, the [[List of worst MLB season records|fourth-worst record in Major League history]], just a few percentage points fewer than the infamous [[1962 New York Mets season|1962 New York Mets]].

== Personal life ==

Ruth married Helen Woodford in 1914.&lt;ref name = &quot;swijfg&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title = Ruth &amp; his marriage | url=http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h1698.html | accessdate = October 24, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Owing to his [[Adultery|infidelities]], they were reportedly separated around 1926.&lt;ref name = &quot;swijfg&quot;/&gt;  Helen died in a fire in [[Watertown, Massachusetts]] on January 11, 1929 in a house owned by Edward Kinder, a dentist whom she had been living with as &quot;Mrs. Kinder&quot;. Kinder identified her body as being that of his wife, then went into hiding after Helen's true identity was revealed; Ruth himself had to get authorities to issue a new death certificate in her legal name, Margaret Helen Woodford Ruth.&lt;ref&gt;Montville p. 282-286&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruth had two daughters. [[Dorothy Ruth]] was adopted by Babe and Helen. Decades later, she wrote a book, ''My Dad, the Babe'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pirone|first=Dorothy|coauthors=Chris Martens|title=My Dad, The Babe: Growing up with an American Hero |year=1988|publisher=Quinlan Press|location=Boston|isbn=1557700311 |oclc=17652057|page=250}}&lt;/ref&gt; claiming that she was Ruth's biological child by a girlfriend named Juanita Jennings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE1DC173EF933A15756C0A96F948260 |title=NY times story |publisher=New York Times |date=May 20, 1989 |accessdate=September 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://baseballguru.com/omi/ruthandhiswomen.htm |title=baseballguru.com |publisher=baseballguru.com |date= |accessdate=September 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dorothy obit&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE1DC173EF933A15756C0A96F948260 |title= Dorothy R.

Ruth adopted Julia Hodgson when he married her mother, actress and model [[Claire Merritt Hodgson]].  Julia currently resides in Arizona, and threw out the ceremonial first pitch before the final game in the original Yankee Stadium on September 21, 2008.

Ruth and Claire regularly wintered in Florida, frequently playing [[golf]] during the off-season and while the Yankees were spring training in [[Tampa, Florida]]. After retirement, he had a winter beachfront home in [[Treasure Island, Florida]], near [[St. Petersburg, Florida|St. Petersburg]].

=== Radio and films ===
[[File:HeadingHome-BabeRuth1920.jpg|thumb|Screenshot from [[Headin' Home]]]]

Ruth made many forays into various popular media. He was heard often on radio in the 1930s and 1940s, both as a guest and on his own programs with various titles: ''The Adventures of Babe Ruth'' was a 15-minute [[Blue Network]] show heard three times a week from April 16 to July 13, 1934. Three years later, he was on CBS twice a week in ''Here's Babe Ruth'' which was broadcast from April 14 to July 9, 1937. That same year he portrayed himself in &quot;[[Alibi Ike]]&quot; on ''[[Lux Radio Theater]]''. His ''Baseball Quiz'' was first heard Saturdays on NBC June 5 to July 10, 1943 and then later that year from August 28 to November 20 on NBC, followed by another NBC run from July 8 to October 21, 1944.

His film roles included a cameo appearance as himself in the [[Harold Lloyd]] film ''[[Speedy (film)|Speedy]]'' (1928). His first film appearance occurred in 1920, in the [[silent movie]] ''[[Headin' Home]]''. He made numerous other film appearances in the silent era, usually either playing himself or playing a ballplayer similar to himself.

Ruth's voice was said by some biographers to be similar to that of film star [[Clark Gable]], although that was obviously not evident in the silent film era. He had an appropriate role as himself in ''[[Pride of the Yankees]]'' (1942), the story of his ill-fated teammate Lou Gehrig. Ruth had three scenes in the film, including one in which he appeared with a straw hat. He said, &quot;If I see anyone touch it, I'll knock his teeth in!&quot; The teammates convinced young Gehrig ([[Gary Cooper]]) to chew up the hat; he got away with it. In the second scene, the players go to a restaurant, where Babe sees a side of [[beef]] cooking and jokes, &quot;Well, I'll have one of those...&quot; and, the dramatic scene near the end, where Gehrig makes his speech at [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]] ending with &quot;I consider myself the luckiest man...&quot;

=== Retirement and post-playing days ===

In 1936, Ruth was one of the [[Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1936|first five players]] elected into the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Baseball Hall of Fame]]. Two years later, [[Larry MacPhail]], the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]] general manager, offered him a first base coaching job in June.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=fMMRAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=eegDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6387,6669658|title=Babe Ruth Returns to Baseball to Act as Coach For Brooklyn|agency=Associated Press|work=Eugene Register-Guard|date=June 19, 1938|accessdate=August 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ruth took the job but quit at the end of the season. The coaching position was his last job in Major League Baseball. His baseball career finally came to an end in 1943. In a charity game at Yankee Stadium, he pinch hit and drew a walk. In 1947, he became director of the [[American Legion]]'s youth baseball program.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/media.do?action=clip&amp;id=v3t6|title=History Channel audio clip of Babe Ruth at Yankee Stadium on April 27, 1947|publisher=History.com|accessdate=October 22, 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080423073127/http://www.history.com/media.do?action=clip&amp;id=v3t6 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = April 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Baby Ruth candy bar controversy ===
For decades, the [[Baby Ruth]] candy bar was believed to be named after Babe Ruth and some sports marketing practitioners used this example of one of the first forms of [[sports marketing]]. However, while the name of the candy bar sounds nearly identical to the Babe's name, the Curtiss Candy Company has steadfastly claimed that Baby Ruth was named after President [[Grover Cleveland]]'s daughter, [[Ruth Cleveland]]. Nonetheless, th
