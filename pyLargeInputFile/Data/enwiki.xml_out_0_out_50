== Etymology ==
The origin of the term is uncertain, and many researchers have different theories on how the word entered the [[English language|English]] [[vocabulary]]. One source asserts that the term entered the language in 1827, adapted from an extinct Aboriginal language of [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]], but mentions a variant, ''wo-mur-rang'', which it dates from 1798.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=boomerang&amp;searchmode=none Boomerang], [http://www.etymonline.com/ Online Etymology Dictionary].&lt;/ref&gt; The boomerang was first encountered by western people at [[Farm Cove, New South Wales|Farm Cove]] ([[Port Jackson]]), Australia, in December 1804 where its use as a weapon was witnessed during a tribal [[Skirmisher|skirmish]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/626558 |title=SYDNEY |publisher=NLA Australian Newspapers|date= |accessdate=2010-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Australia Boomerang Distribution.PNG|thumb|Distribution of boomerangs in Australia]]
[[File:Australia Cairns Boomerang.jpg|thumb|Australian Aboriginal boomerangs]]

The oldest [[Australian Aborigines|Australian Aboriginal]] boomerangs are ten thousand years old, but older hunting sticks have been discovered in [[Europe]], where they seem to have formed part of the [[Stone Age|stone age]] arsenal of [[weapon]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boomer&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.rangs.co.uk/boomhistory.htm | title=Boomerang History | publisher=www.rangs.co.uk | accessdate=2008-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; One boomerang that was discovered in a cave in the [[Carpathian Mountains]] in [[Poland]] was made of mammoth's tusk and is believed, based on [[Accelerator mass spectrometry|AMS dating]] of objects found with it, to be about 30,000 years old.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oblazowa.pan.krakow.pl/en/zabytki.htm Oblazowa Cave Finds]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rediboom.com/englisch/geschich/polen.html Palaeolithic Throwing Object] - Throwing experiments with the Palaeolithic throwing object from the Oblazowa in the Polish Carpathians&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- (''[http://www.oblazowa.pan.krakow.pl/en/zdjecia/bumerang.jpg photograph],'' worth of uploading to Wikipedia—must be [[public domain]] because published by [[Polish Academy of Sciences]])--&gt; [[Tutankhamun|King Tutankhamen]], the famous [[Pharaoh]] of ancient [[Egypt]], who died over 2,000 years ago, owned a collection of boomerangs of both the straight flying ([[hunting]]) and returning variety.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boomer&quot; /&gt;

No one knows for sure how the returning boomerang was first invented, but some modern boomerang makers speculate that it developed from the flattened [[throwing stick]], still used by the [[Australian Aborigines]] and some other tribal people around the world, including the [[Navajo people|Navajo Indians]] in America. A [[hunting]] boomerang is delicately balanced and much harder to make than a returning one. Probably, the curving flight characteristic of returning boomerangs was first noticed by [[Stone Age|stone age]] [[Hunting|hunters]] trying to &quot;tune&quot; their throwing sticks to fly straight.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boomer&quot; /&gt;
In 1909 the Ngarrindjeri inventor [[David Unaipon]] patented an invention for a rotary wing aircraft based on his study of boomerang aerodynamics.

== Modern use ==

Today, boomerangs are mostly used as sporting items. There are different types of throwing contests: accuracy of return; Aussie round; trick catch; [[maximum time aloft]]; fast catch; and endurance (see below). The modern sport boomerang (often referred to as a 'boom' or 'rang'), is made of [[Finland|Finnish]] birch [[plywood]], [[hardwood]], [[plastic]] or [[composite material]]s and comes in many different shapes and colours. Most sport boomerangs typically weigh less than {{convert|100|g|oz}}, with MTA boomerangs (boomerangs used for the maximum time aloft event) often under {{convert|25|g|oz|1}}.

The modern boomerang is often CAD designed with precision airfoils. The number of &quot;wings&quot; is often more than 2 as more lift is provided by 3 or 4 wings than by 2.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boomerangs.com/aerodynamics.html Boomerang Aerodynamics], [http://www.boomerangs.com boomerangs.com].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Saulius Pakalnis, [http://www.researchsupporttechnologies.com/boomerang_site/boomerang1.htm Aerodynamics of Boomerang], April 21, 2006, [http://www.researchsupporttechnologies.com researchsupporttechnologies.com].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, [[Japan]]ese astronaut [[Takao Doi]] verified that boomerangs also function in [[Weightlessness|zero gravity]] as they do on [[Earth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0,23739,23411383-952,00.html |title=Boomerang works in space, says astronaut |publisher=News.com.au |date=2008-03-21 |accessdate=2010-03-03}} {{Dead link|date=August 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.universetoday.com/2008/03/24/does-a-boomerang-work-in-space/ |title=Does a Boomerang Work in Space? |publisher=Universetoday.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hunting ==

It is believed that the shape and elliptical flight path of the returning boomerang makes it useful for hunting.{{Who|date=January 2009}} Noise generated by the movement of the boomerang through the air, and, by a skilled thrower, lightly clipping leaves of a tree {{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} whose branches house birds, would help scare the birds towards the thrower. This was used to frighten flocks or groups of birds into nets that were usually strung up between trees or thrown by hidden hunters.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | last1 = Lloyd | first1 = John | last2 = Mitchinson | first2 = John | title = The Book of General Ignorance | year = 2006 | publisher = Mackays of Chatham | isbn = 978-0-571-23368-7 | page = 244 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-returning boomerangs (termed &quot;throwsticks&quot;) for hunting larger prey, such as [[kangaroo]], were used for small prey as well. These throwsticks fly in a nearly straight path when thrown horizontally and are heavy enough to take down a kangaroo on impact to the legs or knees. For hunting [[emu]], the throwstick is aimed toward the bird's neck, in an attempt to break it.

== Communication ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2010}}

It has been documented that Western Victorian [[Australian Aborigines|Australian aborigines]] used the returnable boomerang, in addition to hunting, as a means of communication over long distances {{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} . This visual communication is especially useful when winds or distance make impossible other well known methods of communication such as ''[[cooee]]''.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

== Design ==
[[File:Boomerangs - melbourne show 2005.jpg|thumb|Boomerangs for sale at the 2005 Melbourne Show]]

A boomerang is a rotating wing. Though it is not a requirement that the boomerang be in its traditional shape, it is usually flat. A falling boomerang starts spinning, and most then fall in a spiral.
When the boomerang is thrown with high spin, the [[wing]]s produce [[lift (force)|lift]].
Larger boomerangs are used in hunting, thus they drop on the ground after striking the target. Smaller ones are used in sport, and are the only boomerangs that return to the thrower. Because of its rapid spinning, a boomerang flies in a curve rather than a straight line. When thrown correctly, a boomerang returns to its starting point.

Returning boomerangs consist of two or more arms, or [[wing]]s, connected at an angle. Each wing is shaped as an [[Airfoil]], so air travels faster over one side of the wing than the other. This difference in air speed creates suction or [[lift (force)|lift]] along what is roughly a plane which intersects the aerofoil at a near right angle along the long axis of the wing.

These wings are set so that the lift created by each wing opposes the lift of the other, but at an angle such that the flight pattern is constantly shifted as the forces of lift, drag, [[Moment of inertia|rotational inertia]] (and so on.) 'attempt' to reach equilibrium. In simple terms, this means that one side of the boomerang is different from the other. If both wings were identical, then the boomerang would spin, but fly in a straight line.

[[Precession#Torque-induced|Gyroscopic precession]] is what makes the boomerang return to the thrower when thrown correctly. This is also what makes the boomerang fly straight up into the air when thrown incorrectly. With the exception of long-distance boomerangs, they should not be thrown sidearm or like a [[Flying disc|Frisbee]], but rather thrown with the long axis of the wings rotating in an almost-vertical plane. When throwing a returning boomerang correctly, it is important to follow the correct instructions to achieve a successful return.

Some boomerangs have [[turbulator]]s—bumps or pits on the top surface that act to increase the lift as boundary layer transition activators (to keep attached turbulent flow instead of laminar separation).

Fast Catch boomerangs usually have three or more symmetrical wings (in the [[planform]] view), whereas a Long Distance boomerang is most often shaped similar to a question mark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baggressive.com/copper/thumbnails.php?album=6 |title='baggressive.com' |publisher=Baggressive.com |date=2005-04-19 |accessdate=2010-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maximum Time Aloft boomerangs mostly have one wing considerably longer than the other. This feature, along with carefully executed bends and twists in the wings, help to set up an 'auto-rotation' effect to maximise the boomerang's hover-time in descending from the highest point in its flight.

== Throwing technique ==
[[File:Boomerang (PSF).jpg|thumb|diagram of the throwing of a left-handed boomerang]]

A right-handed boomerang is thrown with a counter-clockwise spin causing a counter-clockwise flight (as seen from above). Conversely, a left-handed boomerang is constructed as a mirror image with the aerofoils' leading edges on the left side of the wings, as seen from above, causing it to produce lift when circling clockwise. Although appearing symmetrical from a plan view, the leading edges are on opposite edges of the wings (leading and trailing) so as to present the leading edges of the aerofoil to the wind when spinning.

Most sport boomerangs are in the range of about {{convert|70|to|110|g|oz}}. The range on most is between {{convert|20|and|40|m|yd}}. Boomerangs are generally thrown in treeless, large open spaces that are twice as large as the range of the boomerang. A right- or left-handed boomerang can be thrown with either hand, but the flight direction will depend upon the boomerang, not the thrower. Throwing a boomerang with the wrong hand requires a throwing motion that many throwers may find awkward.

For ''right-handed'' boomerangs, throwers first establish the wind and launch direction by first facing into the wind, slowly turning their head left to right. They then turn between thirty to seventy degrees clockwise to the right, depending on wind speed (turning further for stronger winds).

The thrower stands sideways with feet-apart, left foot forward, so as to point in the direction of flight. Holding the right (or left) wing tip, flat side down, using the thumb on top and one to three fingers below, they tilt the boomerang upright at a ten to thirty degree angle from vertical. Cocking the boomerang back so that the central bend touches their forearm to allow adequate spin. They aim, by pointing with their left arm, at, or just above, the horizon.

Sharply stepping forward with the left foot, throwers follow through with their right arm and leg as they launch the boomerang in a similar way to throwing a spear or ball. Launching is performed crisply using a whip-like flick with their index finger, at the end of the throw, so as to cause counter-clockwise spin (seen from above). The strength of throw and spin must be varied according to the speed of the wind—the stronger the wind, the less power is required to provide lift enough to make the return journey. In other words, the stronger the wind, the softer the boomerang is thrown.

The boomerang initially should curve around to the left, climb gently, level out in mid-flight, arc around and descend slowly, and then finish by popping up slightly, hovering, then stalling near the thrower. Ideally, it should hover momentarily, to allow the catcher to clamp their hands shut decisively and firmly on the horizontal boomerang from above and below, sandwiching the centre between the catcher's hands. In other words, it is possible to avoid painful wing strikes to the hand by not sticking fingers directly into the edge of the fast-spinning wing rotor.

Boomerangs shouldn't be thrown level like a flying disc, as it will turn upwards abruptly in the direction of the top of its aerofoils, so if that direction happens to be up rather than to the side it may soar up so high and quickly down again so that the subsequent landing may cause damage.

Wind speed and direction are very important for a successful throw. A right-handed boomerang is thrown with the wind on one's left cheek. The angle to the wind depends on the boomerang, but starting with a 45 degree angle is recommended. Depending on where the boomerang lands, this angle can be modified so that a closer return is achieved. For example, if the boomerang lands too far on the left, turn to throw more to the right of the wind the next time. If the return goes over one's head, then throw softer. If it falls short, then throw harder. As for the wind speed, a light wind of three to five miles an hour is ideal. If the wind is strong enough to fly a kite, then that's usually too strong for boomerangs.

Throwers can modify various actions to achieve a closer return according to the conditions; the throw angle to the wind, the tilt, the power, the spin, and the inclination can be adjusted to vary the return point so the catch point can be perfected. Facing into the wind, then turning the head slightly to either side to check for the cooling effect, allows one to assess the wind direction, and thus the throwing direction, more accurately. For consistency, return to the same throw point and then use a background target object on the horizon to throw in the same direction relative to the wind each time.

== Competitions and records ==

In international competition, a ''world cup'' is held every second year. {{as of|2010}}, teams from [[Germany]] and the [[United States]] dominated international competition. The individual World Champion title was won in 2000, 2002 and 2004 by Swiss thrower [[Manuel Schütz]]. In 2006, [[Fridolin Frost]] from Germany won the title, with Manuel Schütz finishing third.

=== Competition disciplines ===

Modern boomerang tournaments usually involve some or all of the events listed below &lt;ref name=&quot;German Wikipedia&quot;&gt;Based on original text from German wiki.[[:de:Bumerang]]&lt;/ref&gt; In all disciplines the boomerang must travel at least {{convert|20|m|ft}} from the thrower. Throwing takes place individually. The thrower stands at the centre of concentric rings marked on an open field.

Events include:

* ''Aussie Round'': considered by many to be the ultimate test of boomeranging skills. The boomerang should ideally cross the {{convert|50|m|ft|adj=on}} circle and come right back to the centre. Each thrower has five attempts. Points are awarded for distance, accuracy and the catch.
* ''Accuracy'': points are awarded according to how close the boomerang lands to the centre of the rings. The thrower must not touch the boomerang after it has been thrown. Each thrower has five attempts. In major competitions there are two accuracy disciplines: Accuracy 100 and Accuracy 50.
* ''Endurance'': points are awarded for the number of catches achieved in 5 minutes.
* ''Fast Catch'': the time taken to throw and catch the boomerang five times. The winner has the fastest timed catches.
* ''Trick Catch/Doubling'': points are awarded for trick catches behind the back, between the feet, and so on. In Doubling the thrower has to throw two boomerangs at the same time and catch them in sequence in a special way.
* ''Consecutive Catch'': points are awarded for the number of catches achieved before the boomerang is dropped. The event is not timed.
* ''MTA 100'' (''Maximal Time Aloft'', {{convert|100|m|ft}}): points are awarded for the length of time spent by the boomerang in the air. The field is normally a circle measuring 100&amp;nbsp;m. An alternative to this discipline, without the 100&amp;nbsp;m restriction is called ''MTA unlimited''.
* ''Long Distance'': the boomerang is thrown from the middle point of a {{convert|40|m|ft|adj=on}} baseline. The furthest distance travelled by the boomerang away from the baseline is measured. On returning the boomerang must cross the baseline again but does not have to be caught. A special section is dedicated to LD below.
* ''Juggling'': as with Consecutive Catch, only with two boomerangs. At any given time one boomerang must be in the air.

== Long distance boomerangs ==
{{Original research|section|date=October 2009}}
Long distance boomerang throwers aim to have the boomerang go the furthest possible distance while returning close to the throwing point. In competition the boomerang must intersect an imaginary surface defined as an [[infinity|infinite]] [[Vertical angles|vertical]] [[extrusion|extrude]] of a {{convert|40|m|yd|adj=on}} large line centred on the thrower. Outside of competitions, the definition is not so strict, and the thrower is happy whenever he does not have to travel {{convert|50|m|yd}} after the throw, to recover the boomerang.

=== General properties ===

Long-distance boomerangs are optimised to have minimal drag while still having enough lift to fly and return. For this reason, they have a very narrow throwing window, which discourages many beginners from continuing with this discipline. For the same reason, the quality of manufactured long-distance boomerangs is often non-deterministic.

Today's long-distance boomerangs have almost all an ''S'' or ''? - question mark'' shape and have a [[bevel]]ed edge on both sides (the bevel on the bottom side is sometimes called an undercut). This is to minimise drag and lower the lift. Lift must be low because the boomerang is thrown with an almost total layover (flat). Long distance boomerangs are most frequently made of composite material, mainly glass fibre [[epoxy]] composites.

=== Flight path ===

The projection of the flight path of long distance boomerang on the ground resembles a [[Drop (liquid)|water drop]]. For older types of long distance boomerangs (all types of so called big hooks), the first and last third of the flight path are very low, while the middle third is a fast climbing followed by a fast descent. Nowadays boomerangs are made in a way that their whole flight path is almost planar with a constant climbing during the first half of the trajectory and then a rather constant descent during the second half.

From theoretical point of view, long-distance boomerangs are interesting also for the following reason: for achieving a different behaviour during different flight phases, the ratio of the rotation frequency to the forward velocity has a U-shaped function, i.e. its [[derivative]] crosses 0. Practically, it means that the boomerang being at the furthest point has a very low forward velocity. The [[kinetic energy]] of the forward component is then stored in the [[potential energy]]. This is not true for other types of boomerangs, where the loss of kinetic energy is non-reversible (the MTAs also store kinetic energy in potential energy during the first half of the flight, but then the potential energy is lost directly by the drag).

==Related terms==
''Kylie'' is one of the Aboriginal words for the hunting stick used in warfare and for hunting animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bumerang-sport.de/story/history.htm | title = What is a boomerang and where does it come from? }}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of following curved flight paths, kylies fly in straight lines from the throwers. They are typically much larger than boomerangs, and can travel very long distances; due to their size and hook shapes, they can cripple or kill an animal or human opponent. The word is perhaps an English corruption of a word meaning ''boomerang'' taken from one of the Western Desert languages, for example, the [[Warlpiri]] word ''karli''.

'''Bodybuilding''' is a form of [[body modification]], involving intensive [[muscle hypertrophy]]. An individual who engages in this activity is referred to as a bodybuilder. In competitive and [[professional bodybuilding]], bodybuilders display their physiques to a panel of [[judge]]s, who assign points based on their appearance. Bodybuilders prepare for competition through a combination of [[Adipose tissue|fat]] loss, [[oil]]s, and [[Sun tanning|tanning]] (or [[tanning lotion]]s) which combined with lighting make the definition of the muscle group more distinct. 

&lt;!-- IMPORTANT NOTE: Please do not add yourself or other bodybuilders you perceive to be notable. This is an encyclopedia introduction paragraph and is not intended to include a massive dump of everyone who has ever competed or won. Please discuss your additions on the talk page. Random additions of bodybuilders will be removed. --&gt;
Some well-known bodybuilders include [[Charles Atlas]], [[Steve Reeves]], [[Reg Park]], [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], and [[Lou Ferrigno]]. Currently, [[IFBB]] professional bodybuilder [[Jay Cutler (bodybuilder)|Jay Cutler]] from the United States holds the title of [[Mr. Olympia]]. The winner of the annual Mr. Olympia contest is generally recognized as the world's top professional bodybuilder.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.flexonline.com/2009_mr_olympia_final_results/news/958&lt;/ref&gt; 

== History ==
[[image:Sandow ca1894.ogv|thumb|right|250px|Sandow in 1894]]

=== Early years ===
The &quot;Early Years&quot; of Western Bodybuilding are considered to be the period between 1880 and 1953.

==== Eugen Sandow ====
Bodybuilding did not really exist prior to the late 19th century, when it was promoted by [[Eugen Sandow]] of  [[Prussia]] (now northern [[Germany]]) ,&lt;ref name=&quot;SandowMuseum&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Sandow: Historic Photographs of Early Bodybuilders - The Sandow Museum: History of Bodybuilding - A Tribute to Eugen Sandow | url = http://www.sandowmuseum.com/ Homepage}}&lt;/ref&gt; who is now generally referred to as &quot;The Father of Modern Bodybuilding&quot;. He is credited as being a pioneer of the sport because he allowed an audience to enjoy viewing his physique in &quot;muscle display performances&quot;. Although audiences were thrilled to see a well-developed physique, those men simply displayed their bodies as part of strength demonstrations or wrestling matches. Sandow had a stage show built around these displays through his manager, [[Florenz Ziegfeld]]. The Oscar winning 1936 [[musical film]] ''[[The Great Ziegfeld]]'', depicts this beginning of modern bodybuilding, when Sandow began to display his body for carnivals. The role of Sandow was played by actor [[Nat Pendleton]].

Sandow became so successful at flexing and posing his physique, he later created several businesses around his fame and was among the first to market products branded with his name alone. He was credited with inventing and selling the first exercise equipment for the masses (machined [[dumbbell]]s, spring [[pulley]]s and tension bands) and even his image was sold by the thousands in &quot;cabinet cards&quot; and other prints.

Sandow was a perfect &quot;gracilian&quot; (this was a standard where a mathematical &quot;ideal&quot; was set up and the &quot;perfect physique&quot; was close to the proportions of ancient Greek and Roman statues from classical times - see [[Golden ratio|Golden Mean]]). This is how Sandow built his own physique and in the early years, men were judged by how closely they matched these &quot;ideal&quot; proportions. Sandow organised the first bodybuilding contest on September 14, 1901 called the &quot;Great Competition&quot; and held in the [[Royal Albert Hall]], [[London]], [[United Kingdom|UK]]. Judged by himself, Sir Charles Lawes, and [[Arthur Conan Doyle|Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]], the contest was a huge success and was sold out and hundreds of physical culture enthusiasts were turned away. The trophy presented to the winner was a bronze statue of Sandow himself sculpted by Frederick Pomeroy. The winner was William L. Murray of [[Nottingham, England]]. The most prestigious bodybuilding contest today is the [[Mr. Olympia]], and since 1977, the winner has been presented with the same bronze statue of Sandow that he himself presented to the winner at the first contest.

==== First large-scale bodybuilding competition in America ====
On 16 January 1904, the first large-scale bodybuilding competition in America took place at [[Madison Square Garden]] in [[New York City]]. The winner was [[Al Treloar]] and he was declared &quot;The Most Perfectly Developed Man in the World&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sandowplus.co.uk/Competition/Treloar/treloar.htm Al Treloar at SandowPlus.com]&lt;/ref&gt;  Treloar won a $1,000 cash prize, a substantial sum at that time. Two weeks later, [[Thomas Edison]] made a film of Al Treloar's posing routine. Edison also made two films of Sandow a few years before, making him the man who made the first three motion pictures featuring a bodybuilder. In the early 20th century, [[Bernarr Macfadden]] and [[Charles Atlas]], continued to promote bodybuilding across the world. [[Alois P. Swoboda]] was an early pioneer in America.

==== Notable early bodybuilders ====

Many other important bodybuilders in the early history of bodybuilding prior to 1930 include: Earle Liederman (writer of some of the earliest bodybuilding instruction books), [[Zishe Breitbart]], [[Georg Hackenschmidt]], Emy Nkemena, George F. Jowett, Finn Hateral (a pioneer in the art of posing), Monte Saldo, Launceston Elliot, Sig Klein, Sgt. Alfred Moss, Joe Nordquist, Lionel Strongfort (Strongfortism), Gustav Fristensky (the Czech champion), [[Ralph Parcaut]], a champion wrestler who also authored an early book on &quot;physical culture,&quot; and Alan C. Mead, who became an impressive muscle champion despite the fact that he lost a leg in [[World War I]].

[[Image:Bodybuilder,1953.jpg|thumb|left|225px|Model Jackie Coey with Mr. Los Angeles contestant Ed Holovchik (also known as [[Ed Fury]]), 1953]]

=== 1950s and 1960s ===
Bodybuilding became more popular in the 1950s and 1960s with the emergence of strength and gymnastics champions joining the sport, and the simultaneous popularization of muscle training, most of all by [[Charles Atlas]], whose advertising in comic books and other publications encouraged many young men to undertake weight training to improve their physiques to resemble the comic books' muscular superheroes.  Of notable athletes, US national and gymnastics champion and US Olympic weightlifting team competitor [[John Grimek]] and British strength athlete [[Reg Park]] as winners of newly created bodybuilding titles such as the [[Universe Championships|Mr. Universe]] and [[IFBB Mr. America|Mr. America]] competitions paved the way for others.  Magazines such as ''[[Strength &amp; Health]]'' and ''[[Muscular Development]]'' were accompanied by the fame of [[Muscle Beach]], in Santa Monica, California.  The casting of some bodybuilders in movies was another major vehicle for the sport's popularization.  Of bodybuilder-actors perhaps the most famous were [[Steve Reeves]] and Reg Park, who were featured in roles portraying [[Hercules]], [[Samson]] and other legendary heroes.  [[Dave Draper]] gained public fame through a role in ''[[Don't Make Waves]],'' and in appearances in television series such as the ''[[Beverly Hillbillies]]''  and ''[[The Monkees]].''  Other rising stars in this period were [[Larry Scott (bodybuilder)|Larry Scott]], [[Serge Nubret]], and [[Sergio Oliva]].   The gym equipment and training supplement industries founded by [[Joe Weider]] were complemented by the growth of the [[International Federation of BodyBuilding &amp; Fitness]] (IFBB), which was co-founded by Joe and his brother [[Ben Weider|Ben]]. The IFBB eventually displaced the [[Amateur Athletic Union]]'s Mr. Universe titles and also that of NABBA, the [[National Amateur Bodybuilders Association]] as the most important and notable contests.

=== 1970s onwards ===
==== New organizations ====
In the 1970s, bodybuilding had major publicity thanks to [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] and others in the 1977 film ''[[Pumping Iron]]''. By this time the [[International Federation of BodyBuilding &amp; Fitness]] (IFBB) dominated the sport and the [[Amateur Athletic Union]] (AAU) took a back seat.

The [[National Physique Committee]] (NPC) was formed in 1981 by [[Jim Manion]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifbbpro.com/features/jim-manion-chairman-ifbb-professional-league/ ]&lt;/ref&gt; who had just stepped down as chairman of the AAU Physique Committee. The NPC has gone on to become the most successful bodybuilding organization in the U.S., and is the amateur division of the IFBB in the United States. The late 1980s and early 1990s saw the decline of AAU sponsored bodybuilding contests. In 1999, the AAU voted to discontinue its bodybuilding events.

==== Rise of anabolic steroids ====

[[Image:Ronnie Coleman 8 x Mr Olympia - 2009 - 7.png|thumb|300px|right|[[Ronnie Coleman]] 8 x [[Mr. Olympia]] - 2009]]

This period also saw the rise of [[anabolic steroid]]s used both in bodybuilding and many other sports. In bodybuilding lore, this is partly attributed to the rise of &quot;mass monsters&quot;, beginning with [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], [[Sergio Oliva]] and [[Lou Ferrigno]] in the late 1960s and early 1970s and continuing in the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s with [[Lee Haney]], [[Dorian Yates]], [[Ronnie Coleman]] and [[Markus Ruhl]]. Also the emergence of bodybuilders such as [[Greg Kovacs]], [[Paul DeMayo]] and Victor Richards who, while not being particularly successful at the pro level, attained mass and size at levels that were not seen previously. 

To combat this, and in the hopes of becoming a member of the [[IOC]], the IFBB introduced [[Use of performance enhancing drugs in sport|doping]] tests for both steroids and other banned substances. Although doping tests occurred, the majority of professional bodybuilders still used anabolic steroids for competition. During the 1970s the use of anabolic steroids was openly discussed partly due to the fact they were legal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Similarly in Canada, steroids were added to the [[Criminal Code of Canada]] as a Class IV controlled substance (that class was created expressly for steroids).

==== World Bodybuilding Federation ====
[[Image:World Bodybuilding Federation old logo.png|thumb|180px|WBF Logo]]
{{Main|World Bodybuilding Federation}}
In 1990, wrestling promoter [[Vince McMahon]] announced he was forming a new bodybuilding organization, the [[World Bodybuilding Federation]] (WBF). McMahon wanted to bring [[WWE|WWF]]-style showmanship and bigger prize money to the sport of bodybuilding. A number of IFBB stars were recruited but the roster was never very large, with the same athletes competing; the most notable winner and first WBF champion was [[Gary Strydom]].  McMahon formally dissolved the WBF in July 1992.  Reasons for this probably included lack of income from the pay-per-view broadcasts of the WBF contests, slow sales of the WBF's magazine ''Bodybuilding Lifestyles'' (which later became ''WBF Magazine''), and the expense of paying multiple 6-figure contracts as well as producing two TV shows and a monthly magazine.

==== Olympic sport discussion ====
In the early 2000s, the IFBB was attempting to make bodybuilding an [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] sport. It obtained full IOC membership in 2000 and was attempting to get approved as a demonstration event at the Olympics which would hopefully lead to it being added as a full contest. This did not happen. Olympic recognition for bodybuilding remains controversial since many argue that bodybuilding is not a sport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==== Recent developments ====
In 2003, [[Joe Weider]] sold Weider Publications to [[American Media (publisher)|AMI]], which owns ''[[The National Enquirer]]''. The position of president of the IFBB was filled by Rafael Santonja following the death of [[Ben Weider]] in October 2008. In 2004, contest promoter Wayne DeMilia broke ranks with the IFBB and AMI took over the promotion of the Mr. Olympia contest.  Other professional contests emerged in this period, most notably the [[Arnold Classic]] and [[Night of Champions]] but also the European Grand Prix of Bodybuilding.  Also with the growth of consumer lifestyles in Europe and especially in Eastern Europe following the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]] saw whole new populations of bodybuilders emerge from those areas.

== Areas ==
=== Professional bodybuilding ===
{{Main|Professional bodybuilding}}
In the modern bodybuilding industry, &quot;[[Professional bodybuilding|professional]]&quot; generally means a bodybuilder who has won qualifying competitions as an amateur and has earned a &quot;pro card&quot; from the IFBB. Professionals earn the right to compete in sanctioned competitions including the Arnold Classic and the New York Pro (formerly the Night of Champions). Placings at such competitions in turn earn them the right to compete at the [[Mr. Olympia]]; the title is considered to be the highest accolade in the professional bodybuilding field. Steroid testing in these competitions is generally never done.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

=== Natural bodybuilding ===
{{Main|Natural bodybuilding}}
In natural contests bodybuilders are routinely tested for illegal substances and are banned for any violations from future contests. Testing can be done on urine samples, but in many cases a less expensive polygraph (lie detector) test is performed instead. What qualifies as an &quot;illegal&quot; substance, in the sense that it is prohibited by regulatory bodies, varies between natural federations, and does not necessarily include only substances that are illegal under the laws of the relevant jurisdiction. Illegal [[Anabolic steroids]], [[Prohormone]] and [[Diuretic]]s,
under widespread use by professional bodybuilders, are generally banned by natural organizations. Natural bodybuilding organizations include NANBF (North American Natural Bodybuilding Federation), and the NPA (Natural Physique Association). Natural bodybuilders assert that their method is more focused on competition and a healthier lifestyle than other forms of bodybuilding.

=== Female bodybuilding ===
[[Image:Nikki Fuller.jpg|left|thumb|175px|Pro female bodybuilder [[Nikki Fuller]] performs a side chest pose.]]
{{Main|Female bodybuilding}}
The first U.S. Women's National Physique Championship, promoted by Henry McGhee and held in Canton, Ohio in 1978, is generally regarded as the first true female bodybuilding contest - that is, the first contest where the entrants were judged solely on muscularity.&lt;ref&gt;Todd, Jan, &quot;Bodybuilding&quot;, St. James Encyclopedia of Pop Culture, Gale Group, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; In 1980 the first [[Ms. Olympia]] (initially known as the &quot;Miss&quot; Olympia), the most prestigious contest for professionals, was held. The first winner was [[Rachel McLish]] who had also won the NPC's USA Championship earlier in the year. The contest was a major turning point for the sport of women's bodybuilding. McLish inspired many future competitors to start training and competing. In 1985, a movie called ''[[Pumping Iron II: The Women]]'' was released. This film documented the preparation of several women for the 1983 [[Caesars Palace]] World Cup Championship.  Competitors prominently featured in the film were [[Kris Alexander]], Lori Bowen, [[Lydia Cheng]], Carla Dunlap, [[Bev Francis]], and Rachel McLish. At the time, Francis was actually a [[powerlifting|powerlifter]], though she soon made a successful transition to bodybuilding, becoming one of the leading competitors of the late 1980s and early 1990s.

In recent years, the related areas of [[fitness and figure competition]] have gained in popularity, surpassing that of female bodybuilding, and have provided an alternative for women who choose not to develop the level of muscularity necessary for bodybuilding. Rachel McLish would closely resemble what is thought of today as a fitness and figure competitor instead of what is now considered a female bodybuilder. Fitness competitions also have a gymnastic element to them.{{clr}}

== Competition ==
[[Image:Lukáš Osladil.jpg|right|thumb|185px|A bodybuilder posing on stage during a competition. The pose is a variation of the &quot;most muscular&quot;.]]
In competitive bodybuilding, bodybuilders aspire to develop and maintain an [[aesthetics|aesthetically]] pleasing{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} body and balanced physique. In prejudging, competitors do a series of mandatory poses - the front lat spread, the rear lat spread, the [[wikt:front double biceps|front double biceps]], the [[wikt:back double biceps|back double biceps]], the [[wikt:side chest|side chest]], the [[wikt:side triceps|side triceps]], the [[wikt:most muscular|most muscular]] (men only), and the thigh-abdominal pose.  Each competitor also performs a routine to display the physique.  A [[posedown]] is usually held at the end of a posing round, while judges are finishing their scoring. Bodybuilders spend time practicing their posing, since they are judged on it.

In contrast to [[strongman (strength athlete)|strongman]] or [[powerlifting]] competitions where [[physical strength]] is important, or to [[Olympic weightlifting]], where the main point is equally split between strength and technique, bodybuilding competitions typically emphasize condition, size and symmetry. Different organizations emphasize particular aspects of competition, and sometimes have different categories in which to compete.

=== Preparations ===
==== Cutting and bulking ====
The general strategy adopted by most present-day competitive bodybuilders is to make muscle gains for most of the year (known as the &quot;off-season&quot;) and approximately 12–14 weeks from competition attempt to lose [[Adipose tissue|body fat]] (referred to as &quot;cutting&quot;) while minimizing the loss of muscle mass. Generally this involves reducing calorie intake and increasing [[aerobic exercise]] while monitoring [[body fat percentage]].

The precise effectiveness of the cutting and bulking strategy is unknown, with only limited observational case studies on the subject. No studies involving precise hypercaloric feeding combined with resistance exercise have been conducted.

==== Clean Bulking ====
Many non-competitive bodybuilders choose not to adopt the conventional strategy, as it often results in significant unwanted fat gain during the &quot;bulking&quot; phase. The attempt to increase muscle mass in one's body without any gain in fat is called clean bulking. This is the preferred by non-competitive bodybuilders. While competitive bodybuilders focus their efforts to achieve a peak appearance during a brief &quot;competition season&quot;, most ordinary people prefer to maintain an attractive physique year-round. Anecdotal evidence suggests that a proper weight training and cardio program combined with a modestly hypercaloric diet with proper macronutrient balance can produce steady gains in size and strength, while avoiding significant increases in body fat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fabodylous.com/2010/12/bulking-up.html|title=Bulking Up|accessdate=2011-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Pre-competition ====
In the week leading up to a contest, bodybuilders may decrease their consumption of [[water]], [[sodium]] and [[carbohydrate]]s, the former two to alter how water is retained by the body and the latter to reduce [[glycogen]] in the muscle. The day before the show, water is removed from the diet, and [[diuretic]]s may be introduced, while [[carbohydrate loading]] to increase the size of the muscles through replenishment of their glycogen.  The goal is to maximize leanness and increase the visibility of veins. The appearance of veins is further enhanced immediately before appearing on stage by darkening the skin through [[sunless tanning|tanning products]], applying [[vegetable oil|oils]] to the skin to increase shine.  Some competitors will eat sugar-rich foods to increase the visibility of their veins.  A final step is the use of weights to fill the muscles with blood and further increase their size.

== Muscle growth ==
Bodybuilders use three main strategies to maximize muscle hypertrophy:
* [[Strength training]] through weights or [[Resistance training|elastic/hydraulic resistance]]
* Specialized [[nutrition]], incorporating extra [[protein]]{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} and supplements where necessary
* Adequate rest, including sleep and recuperation between workouts

=== Weight training ===
{{Main|Weight training}}
[[Weight training]] causes micro-tears to the muscles being trained; this is generally known as [[microtrauma]]. These micro-tears in the muscle contribute to the soreness felt after exercise, called [[delayed onset muscle soreness]] (DOMS). It is the repair to these micro-trauma that result in muscle growth {{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}. Normally, this soreness becomes most apparent a day or two after a workout. However, as muscles become adapted to the exercises, soreness tends to decrease.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid7371625&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author=MacDougall JD, Elder GC, Sale DG, Moroz JR, Sutton JR|title=Effects of strength training and immobilization on human muscle fibres|journal=European journal of applied physiology and occupational physiology|volume=43|issue=1|pages=25–34|year=1980|pmid=7371625|doi=10.1007/BF00421352}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Weight training aims to build muscle by prompting two different types of hypertrophy: sarcoplasmic hypertrophy and myofibrillar hypertrophy. Sarcoplasmic hypertrophy leads to larger muscles so is favored by bodybuilders more than myofibrillar hypertrophy which builds athletic strength. Sarcoplasmic hypertrophy is triggered by increasing repetitions, whereas myofibrillar hypertrophy is triggered by lifting heavier weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Weight Training Intensity or Volume for Bigger Muscles? | url = http://www.motleyhealth.com/fitness_and_strength/bodybuilding/weight-training-intensity-or-volume-for-bigger-muscles | accessdate=2009-12-12  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In either case, there is an increase in size and strength of the muscles (compared to if that same individual does not lift weights at all). However, the emphasis is different. 

Many trainees like to cycle between the two methods in order to prevent the body from adapting (maintaining a progressive overload), possibly emphasizing whichever method more suits their goals. I.e, a bodybuilder will use sarcoplasmic hypertrophy most of the time, but may change to myofibrillar hypertrophy temporarily in order to move past a plateau.

=== Nutrition ===

The high levels of muscle growth and repair achieved by bodybuilders require a specialized diet. Generally speaking, bodybuilders require more [[calories]] than the average person of the same weight to provide the protein and energy requirements needed to support their training and increase muscle mass. A sub-maintenance level of food energy is combined with [[cardiovascular exercise]] to lose [[body fat]] in preparation for a contest. The ratios of food energy from carbohydrates, proteins, and fats vary depending on the goals of the bodybuilder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==== Carbohydrates ====
[[Carbohydrate]]s play an important role for bodybuilders. Carbohydrates give the body energy to deal with the rigors of training and recovery. Carbohydrates also promote secretion of [[insulin]], a hormone enabling cells to get the glucose they need. Insulin also carries amino acids into cells and promotes protein synthesis.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} Insulin has steroid-like effects in terms of muscle gains.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} It is impossible to promote protein synthesis without the existence of insulin, and which means without carbohydrates, it is impossible to add muscle mass.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} Bodybuilders seek out [[glycemic index|low-glycemic]] [[polysaccharide]]s and other slowly digesting carbohydrates, which release energy in a more stable fashion than high-[[glycemic index|glycemic]] sugars and starches. This is important as high-glycemic carbohydrates cause a sharp insulin response, which places the body in a state where it is likely to store additional food energy as fat. However, bodybuilders frequently do ingest some quickly digesting sugars (often in form of pure [[glucose|dextrose]] or [[maltodextrin]]) after a workout. This may help to replenish [[glycogen]] stores within the muscle, and to stimulate muscle protein synthesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==== Protein ====
[[File:Protein shake.jpg|thumb|150px|Protein milkshakes, made from protein powder (center) and milk (left), are a common [[bodybuilding supplement]].]]
The motor proteins [[actin]] and [[myosin]] generate the forces exerted by contracting [[muscle]]s. Current advice says that bodybuilders should consume 25-30% of protein per total calorie intake to further their goal of maintaining and improving their body composition.&lt;ref name=&quot;LambertCP&quot;&gt;Lambert CP, Frank LL, Evans WJ. Macronutrient considerations for the sport of bodybuilding. ''Sports Med''. 2004;34(5):317-27. PMID 15107010&lt;/ref&gt; This is a widely debated topic, with many arguing that 1&amp;nbsp;gram of protein per pound of body weight is ideal, some suggesting that less is sufficient, while others recommending 1.5, 2, or more.&lt;ref&gt;Protein: a guide to maximum muscle: confused?

FLEX Magazine, January 2005&lt;/ref&gt; There is also some debate concerning the best type of protein to take. Chicken, turkey, beef, pork, fish, eggs and dairy foods are high in protein, as are some nuts, seeds, beans and lentils. [[Casein]] or [[whey protein|whey]] are often used to supplement the diet with additional protein. Whey protein is the type of protein contained in many popular brands of protein supplements, and is preferred by many bodybuilders because of its high [[Biological Value|Biological Value (BV)]] and quick absorption rates. Bodybuilders are usually thought to require protein with a higher BV than that of [[soy]], which is additionally avoided due to its claimed [[estrogenic]] properties.&lt;ref name=&quot;Soy_Protein_Sucks&quot;&gt;Author L. Rea's Core Performance: Truth For Excellence In Physique &amp; Performance -- Soy Proten Sucks! 
[http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/core_march_9.htm Article]&lt;/ref&gt; Still, some nutrition experts believe that soy, [[flax seeds]] and many other plants that contain the weak estrogen-like compounds or [[phytoestrogens]] can be used beneficially, as phytoestrogens compete with estrogens for receptor sites in the male body and can block its actions. This can also include some inhibition of [[pituitary]] functions while stimulating the P450 system (the system that eliminates chemicals, hormones, drugs and metabolic waste product from the body) in the liver to more actively process and excrete excess estrogen.&lt;ref name=&quot;MikeFalcon&quot;&gt;http://www.maxmuscle.com/index.cfm?fa=article&amp;doc_id=116&amp;subcat=science Estrogens, Testosterone &amp; Phytoestrogens By Mike Falcon&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;TestosteroneSyndrome&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Eugene Shippen; William Fryer |title=The testosterone syndrome: the critical factor for energy, health, and sexuality: reversing the male menopause |publisher=M.

==== Meals ====
Bodybuilders usually split their food intake for the day into 5 to 7 meals of roughly equal nutritional content and attempt to eat at regular intervals (normally between 2 and 3 hours). This method purports to serve 2 purposes: to limit overindulging as well as increasing [[metabolic rate|basal metabolic rate]] when compared to the traditional 3 meals a day. However, research using whole-body calorimetry and [[doubly labeled water]] has found no metabolic advantage to eating more frequently.&lt;ref name=&quot;BellisleF&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bellisle F, McDevitt R, Prentice AM |title=Meal frequency and energy balance |journal=Br.

==== Dietary supplements ====
{{Main|Bodybuilding supplement}}
The important role of nutrition in building muscle and losing fat means bodybuilders may consume a wide variety of [[dietary supplements]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Philen RM, Ortiz DI, Auerbach SB, Falk H | title=Survey of advertising for nutritional supplements in health and bodybuilding magazines | journal=JAMA | year=1992 | pages=1008–11 | volume=268 | issue=8 | pmid=1501305 | doi=10.1001/jama.268.8.1008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various products are used in an attempt to augment muscle size, increase the rate of fat loss, improve joint health, increase natural testosterone production, enhance training performance and prevent potential nutrient deficiencies.

=== Performance enhancing substances ===
Some bodybuilders use drugs such as [[anabolic steroids]] and precursor substances such as [[prohormone]]s to increase [[muscle hypertrophy]].  Anabolic steroids cause muscle [[hypertrophy]] of both types (I and II) of muscle fibers caused likely by an increased synthesis of muscle proteins and are accompanied with undesired side effects including [[hepatotoxicity]], [[gynecomastia]], [[acne]], [[male pattern baldness]] and a decline in the body's own testosterone production, which can cause [[testicular atrophy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other performance enhancing substances used by competitive bodybuilders include [[Growth hormone treatment|human growth hormone]] (HGH), which can cause [[acromegaly]].

=== Rest ===
Although muscle stimulation occurs in the [[gym]] lifting weights, muscle growth occurs afterward during rest. Without adequate rest and sleep, muscles do not have an opportunity to recover and build. About eight hours of sleep a night is desirable for the bodybuilder to be refreshed, although this varies from person to person. Additionally, many athletes find a daytime nap further increases their body's ability to build muscle. Some bodybuilders take several naps per day, during peak anabolic phases and during catabolic phases.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

=== Overtraining ===
{{Main|Overtraining}}
Overtraining occurs when a bodybuilder has trained to the point where his workload exceeds his recovery capacity. There are many reasons that overtraining occurs, including lack of adequate nutrition, lack of recovery time between workouts, insufficient sleep, and training at a high intensity for too long (a lack of splitting apart workouts). Training at a high intensity too frequently also stimulates the [[central nervous system]] (CNS) and can result in a hyper-adrenergic state that interferes with sleep patterns.&lt;ref name=&quot;LonnieLowery_Overtraining&quot;&gt;Testosterone Nation - The Warrior Nerd: Overtraining or Under-eating? Part 1 by Lonnie Lowery, Ph.D. [http://www.t-nation.com/readTopic.do?id=459318 Article]&lt;/ref&gt; To avoid overtraining, intense frequent training must be met with at least an equal amount of purposeful recovery. Timely provision of [[carbohydrates]], [[proteins]], and various micronutrients such as [[vitamins]], [[minerals]], phytochemicals, even nutritional supplements are acutely critical.

It has been argued that overtraining can be beneficial. One article published by ''[[Muscle &amp; Fitness]]'' magazine stated that you can &quot;Overtrain for Big Gains&quot;. It suggested that if one is planning a restful holiday and they do not wish to inhibit their bodybuilding lifestyle too much, they should overtrain before taking the holiday, so the body can rest easily and recuperate and grow. Overtraining can be used advantageously, as when a bodybuilder is purposely overtrained for a brief period of time to super compensate during a regeneration phase. These are known as &quot;shock micro-cycles&quot; and were a key training technique used by Soviet athletes.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid14719980&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

==== Non muscle-developing methods ====
Some bodybuilders, particularly at professional level, use substances such as &quot;site enhancement oil&quot;, commonly known as synthol, to mimic the appearance of developed muscle where it may otherwise be disproportionate or lagging. This is known as &quot;fluffing&quot;.&lt;ref name=synthol/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Health/Fitness/story?id=3179969&amp;page=1|title=Like Implants for the Arms: Synthol Lures Bodybuilders: Risky Injections Mean Massive Muscles for Users|last=Childs|first=Dan|date=16 May 2007|work=ABC News|accessdate=4 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Synthol is 85% oil, 7.5% [[lidocain]], and 7.5% alcohol.&lt;ref name=synthol/&gt; It is not restricted, as it is intended for topical use only, and many brands are available on the internet.&lt;ref name=popeye&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/health/article1782095.ece|title=Bodybuilders puff up with ‘Popeye’ oil jab|last=Foggo|first=Daniel|date=13 May 2007|work=Sunday Times|accessdate=4 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of injected oil to enhance muscle appearance had previously been used in the late 19th century before being abandoned due to health risks such as [[sclerosing lipogranuloma]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{For|the use of [[biological agent]]s by terrorists|bioterrorism}}
{{Weapons of mass destruction}}

'''Biological warfare''' (BW) — also known as '''germ warfare''' — is the deliberate use of [[disease]]-causing [[biological agent]]s such as [[bacteria]], [[virus]]es, [[fungus|fungi]], or [[Toxin#Biotoxins|biological toxins]], to kill or incapacitate humans, animals or plants as an act of war. Biological weapons (often termed &quot;bio-weapons&quot; or &quot;bio-agents&quot;) are living [[organism]]s or replicating entities (viruses) that reproduce or replicate within their [[Host (biology)|host]] victims. 

Biological weapons may be employed in various ways to gain a [[strategy|strategic]] or [[Tactic (method)|tactical]] advantage over an adversary, either by threat or by actual deployment. Like some of the [[chemical weapons]], biological weapons may also be useful as [[area denial weapons]]. These agents may be lethal or [[Non-lethal weapon|non-lethal]], and may be targeted against a single individual, a group of people, or even an entire population. They may be developed, acquired, stockpiled or deployed by [[nation state]]s or by non-national groups. In the latter case, or if a nation-state uses it [[Clandestine operation|clandestinely]], it may also be considered [[bioterrorism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;wheelis&quot;&gt;{{Citation|last=Wheelis|first=Mark|coauthors=Lajos Rózsa, Malcolm Dando|title=Deadly Cultures: Biological Weapons Since 1945|publisher =Harvard University Press|year=2006|pages=284–293, 301–303|isbn=0674016998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is an overlap between biological warfare and [[chemical warfare]], as the use of [[toxin]]s produced by living organisms is considered under the provisions of both the [[Biological Weapons Convention]] and the [[Chemical Weapons Convention]]. Toxins and [[Psychochemical weapons]] are often referred to as ''midspectrum agents''. Unlike bioweapons, these midspectrum agents do not reproduce in their host and are typically characterized by shorter incubation periods.&lt;ref&gt;Gray, Colin. (2007). ''Another Bloody Century: Future Warfare''. '''Page 265 to 266'''. Phoenix. ISBN 0304367346.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Offensive biological warfare, including [[mass production]], stockpiling and use of biological weapons, was outlawed by the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention (BWC). The [[Theory of justification|rationale]] behind this [[treaty]], which has been [[Ratification|ratified]] or acceded to by [[List of parties to the Biological Weapons Convention|163 countries]] as of 2009, is to prevent a biological attack which could conceivably result in large numbers of civilian fatalities and cause severe disruption to economic and societal [[infrastructure]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} Many countries, including signatories of the BWC, currently pursue research into the defense or protection against BW, which is not prohibited by the BWC.

A nation or group that can pose a credible threat of mass casualty has the ability to alter the terms on which other nations or groups interact with it. Biological weapons allow for the potential to create a level of destruction and loss of life far in excess of nuclear, chemical or conventional weapons, relative to their mass and cost of development and storage. Therefore, biological agents may be useful as strategic deterrents in addition to their utility as offensive weapons on the battlefield.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/0/7/3/6/4/p73644_index.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a714004040&amp;db=all&lt;/ref&gt;

As a tactical weapon for military use, a significant problem with a BW attack is that it would take days to be effective, and therefore might not immediately stop an opposing force. Some biological agents (especially [[smallpox]], [[plague (disease)|plague]], and [[tularemia]]) have the capability of person-to-person [[Transmission (medicine)|transmission]] via [[aerosol]]ized [[Transmission_(medicine)#Droplet_Contact|respiratory droplets]]. This feature can be undesirable, as the agent(s) may be transmitted by this mechanism to unintended populations, including neutral or even friendly forces. While containment of BW transmission is less of a concern for certain criminal or terrorist organizations, it remains a significant concern for the military and civilian populations of virtually all nations.

==History==
&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
{{history of war}}

Biological warfare has been practiced repeatedly throughout history. Before the 20th century, the use of biological agents took three major forms:

* Deliberate [[poison]]ing of [[food]] and [[water]] with infectious material
* Use of microorganisms, toxins or animals, living or dead, in a weapon system
* Use of biologically inoculated fabrics

===Antiquity===
The earliest documented incident of the intention to use biological weapons is recorded in [[Hittite language|Hittite]] texts of 1500–1200 B.C, in which victims of plague were driven into enemy lands. Although the Assyrians knew of [[ergot]], a parasitic fungus of rye which produces [[ergotism]] when ingested, there is no evidence that they poisoned enemy wells with the fungus, as has been claimed.

According to [[Homer|Homer's]] epic poems about the legendary [[Trojan War]], the ''[[Iliad]]'' and the ''[[Odyssey]],'' spears and arrows were tipped with poison. During the [[First Sacred War]] in [[Greece]], in about 590 BC, [[Athens]] and the [[Amphictionic League]] poisoned the water supply of the besieged town of [[Kirrha]] (near [[Delphi]]) with the toxic plant [[hellebore]]. The [[Roman Empire|Roman]] commander Manius Aquillus poisoned the wells of besieged enemy cities in about 130 BC.

During the 4th century BC [[Scythia]]n archers tipped their arrow tips with snake venom, human blood, and animal [[feces]] to cause wounds to become [[infection|infected]]. There are numerous other instances of the use of plant toxins, venoms, and other poisonous substances to create biological weapons in antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Mayor|first=Adrienne|title=Greek Fire, Poison Arrows &amp; Scorpion Bombs: Biological and Chemical Warfare in the Ancient World|publisher=Overlook Duckworth|location=Woodstock, N.Y.|year=2003|isbn=978-1-58567-348-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 184 B.C, [[Hannibal Barca|Hannibal of Carthage]] had clay pots filled with [[venomous snakes]] and instructed his soldiers to throw the pots onto the decks of [[Pergamon|Pergamene]] ships. In about AD 198, the Parthian city of [[Hatra]] (near [[Mosul]], Iraq) repulsed the Roman army led by [[Septimius Severus]] by hurling clay pots filled with live scorpions at them.&lt;ref&gt;Cornelius Nepos, ''Hannibal'' 11.5-6. Herodian 3.9.3-8 and Dio Cassius 68.31-75 and Epitome 75.10 and 76.10.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle Ages===
The [[Mongol Empire]] established commercial and political connections between the Eastern and Western areas of the world, but it did so through the most mobile army ever seen. The armies, being the most rapidly moving travelers who had ever moved between the steppes of East Asia (where [[bubonic plague]] was and remains endemic among small rodents) and managed to keep the chain of infection without a break until they reached, and infected, peoples and rodents who had never encountered it. The ensuing [[Black Death]] may have killed almost half of the population of Europe in the next decades, changing the course of Asian and European history.

During the [[Middle Ages]], victims of the bubonic plague were used for biological attacks, often by flinging the infected corpses (formites) and excrement over castle walls using [[catapult]]s. In 1346, during the siege of Kafa (now Feodossia Ukraine) the attacking Tartar Forces which were subjugated by the Mongol empire under Genghis Khan, used the bodies of [[Mongol]] warriors of the [[Golden Horde]] who had died of plague, as weapons. The dead warriors were thrown over the walls of the besieged city of [[Crimean]]. An outbreak of plague followed and the defending forces retreated, followed by the conquest of the city by the Mongol army. It has been speculated that this operation may have been responsible for the advent of the Black Death in Europe. At the time, the attackers thought that the stench was enough to kill them, though it was the disease that was deadly.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

===18th century===
'' North America '' &lt;br&gt;
The [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] population was devastated after contact with the [[Old World]] due to the introduction of many different fatal diseases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pbs.org/gunsgermssteel/variables/smallpox.html The Story Of... Smallpox – and other Deadly Eurasian Germs]&lt;/ref&gt; There are two documented cases of alleged and attempted germ warfare. The first, during a parley at Fort Pitt on June 24, 1763, Ecuyer gave representatives of the besieging Delawares two blankets and a handkerchief that had been exposed to smallpox, hoping to spread the disease to the Natives in order to end the siege.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, ''Crucible of War'', 541–42; Jennings, ''Empire of Fortune'', 447n26.&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Trent]], the militia commander, left records that clearly indicated that the purpose of giving the blankets was &quot;to Convey the Smallpox to the Indians.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Calloway, ''Scratch of a Penn'', 73.&lt;/ref&gt;

British commander Lord [[Jeffrey Amherst]] and Swiss-British officer Colonel [[Henry Bouquet]] certainly discussed this, in the course of [[Pontiac's Rebellion]]; there still exists correspondence referencing the idea of giving smallpox-infected blankets to enemy Indians. Historian Francis Parkman verifies four letters from June 29, July 13, 16 and 26th, 1763. Excerpts: Commander Lord Jeffrey Amherst writes July 16, 1763, &quot;P.S. You will Do well to try to Inocculate the Indians by means of Blankets, as well as to try Every other method that can serve to Extirpate this Execrable Race. I should be very glad your Scheme for Hunting them Down by Dogs could take Effect,...&quot; Colonel Henry Bouquet replies July 26, 1763, &quot;I received yesterday your Excellency's letters of 16th with their Inclosures. The signal for Indian Messengers, and all your directions will be observed.&quot;&lt;ref name=straightdope&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/1088/did-whites-ever-give-native-americans-blankets-infected-with-smallpox
|title=Did whites ever give Native Americans blankets infected with smallpox? |date=October 24, 1997|accessdate=May 1, 2009|publisher=straightdope.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the intent of carrying out biological warfare is clear, there is debate among historians as to whether this actually took place despite Bouquet's affirmative reply to Amherst, and the continuing correspondence on the point. Smallpox is highly infectious and does not require contaminated blankets to spread uncontrollably, and together with [[measles]], influenza, [[chicken pox]], and so on. had been doing so since the arrival of Europeans and their animals. Historians have been unable to establish whether or not the Amherst plan was implemented, particularly in light of the fact that smallpox was already present in the region, and that scientific knowledge of disease at that time had yet to develop an understanding of infection vectors, nor in the case of smallpox a full acknowledgment of the protective effect of a cowpox infection.

Regardless of whether the plan was carried out, trade and combat provided ample opportunity for transmission of the disease. See also: [[Pontiac's War#Siege of Fort Pitt|Small pox during Pontiac's Rebellion]].

The diseases that struck indigenous Americans can be traced to [[Eurasia]] where people had long lived with them and developed some immunological ability to survive their presence. Without similarly long ancestral exposure, indigenous Americans were immunologically naive and extremely vulnerable.&lt;ref&gt;Plagues and Peoples, Wm. McNeil&lt;/ref&gt;

&amp;nbsp;

'' New South Wales''
Australian aborigines (Kooris) have always maintained that the British deliberately spread smallpox in 1789,&lt;ref&gt;Foley, Dennis, ‘’ Repossession of our Spirit: Traditional Owners of Northern Sydney,’’ (2001).  Also Davis, Jack, in ‘’Aborigines of the West: Their Past and Their Present’’ ed. Berndt, RM and CH (1980), UWA Press, Perth.&lt;/ref&gt; but this fact has only been apparent to historians from the 1980s when Dr Noel Butlin suggested; “there are some possibilities that ... disease could have been used deliberately as an exterminating agent”.&lt;ref&gt;Butlin, Noel, ''Our Original Aggression: Aboriginal Populations of Southeastern Australia 1788-1850'' (1983), Allen &amp; Unwin, Syd.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, David Day claimed there “remains considerable circumstantial evidence to suggest that officers other than [[Arthur Phillip|Phillip]], or perhaps convicts or soldiers … deliberately spread smallpox among aborigines” &lt;ref&gt;Day, David, ''Claiming a Continent: a new history of Australia'' (1996), Angus &amp; Robertson, Sydney, p63f.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2000 Dr John Lambert argued that “strong circumstantial evidence suggests the smallpox epidemic which ravaged Aborigines in 1789, may have resulted from deliberate infection”.&lt;ref&gt;Lambert, JT., ‘’Brokers of Cultural Change’’ (2000), ISBN 0646365770, p245.&lt;/ref&gt; 

These claims were controversial as it was argued that any smallpox virus brought to New South Wales would have been sterilised during the voyage of the [[First Fleet]] from England and incapable of biological warfare. However, in 2007, Christopher Warren demonstrated conclusively that the British smallpox was still viable.&lt;ref&gt;Warren C., &quot;Could First Fleet smallpox infect Aborigines? - A note&quot;, ''Aboriginal History 31,'' pp 152-164.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then most scholars have recognised that the British committed biological warfare in 1789 near their new convict settlement at Port Jackson.&lt;ref&gt;Finzsch, Norbert, “Extirpate or remove that vermine: genocide, biological warfare and settler imperialism in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries”,  ''Journal of Genocide Research'' 10(2), June 2008, p215-232  and Mear, C., “The origin of the smallpox in Sydney in 1789”, ''Journal of Royal Australian Historical Society,'' 94(1), pp 1-22.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some earlier writers, misunderstanding that British stocks of virus had been sterilised, proposed that the 1789 outbreak was caused by a hypothetical transmission from Macassar in Sulawesi. However the available records for smallpox in Macassar only show an outbreak in 1789,&lt;ref&gt;Boomgaard, P., ''Smallpox and Vaccination on Java, 1780-1860'' in &quot;Dutch Medicine in the Malay Archipelago 1816-1942: Articles presented at a symposium...&quot; (1989) ISBN 9051831420&lt;/ref&gt; too late and inconvenient to be associated with the First Fleet outbreak.

===19th century===
In 1834, [[Massachusetts]] diarist [[Richard Henry Dana, Jr.|Richard Henry Dana]] visited [[San Francisco]] on a merchant ship. His ship traded many items including blankets with Mexicans and Russians who had established outposts on the northern side of the [[San Francisco Bay]]. Local histories document that the California plague epidemic began at the Russian fort soon after they left. It is possible that the blankets were the source of the contamination (hidden fleas, or rats, perhaps), but another possible source was a Chinese ship making port in San Francisco at the same time. Plague became established in California and has since become endemic throughout much of the North American West. Native rodents have suffered a severe population decline, only partly due to human eradication action.

During the [[American Civil War]], [[William Tecumseh Sherman|General Sherman]] reported that [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] forces shot farm animals in ponds upon which the Union troops depended for drinking water.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} This would have made the water unpleasant to drink, though perhaps the death caused might not have been that desired. A Confederate doctor planned and may have carried out a bacteriological attack on Northern populations across the Canadian border.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

[[Jack London]], in his story '&quot;[[South Sea Tales#&quot;Yah! Yah! Yah!&quot;|Yah! Yah! Yah!]]&quot;', described a punitive European expedition to a [[Oceania|South Pacific]] island deliberately exposing the [[Polynesia]]n population to measles, of which many of them died. While much of the material for London's ''[[South Sea Tales]]'' is derived from his personal experience in the region, it is not known whether this particular incident is historical.

===20th century===
During the [[First World War]], the [[Empire of Germany]] pursued an ambitious biological warfare program. Using [[diplomatic pouch]]es and couriers, the German General Staff supplied small teams of saboteurs in the [[Empire of Russia|Russian]] [[Duchy of Finland]], and in the then-neutral countries of [[Romania]], the [[United States]], and [[Argentina]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

In Finland, saboteurs mounted on reindeer placed ampoules of [[anthrax]] in stables of Russian horses in 1916 .&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20091027151654/http://geocities.com/jamie_bisher/anthrax.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; Anthrax was also supplied to the German [[military attaché]] in [[Bucharest]], as was glanders, which was employed against livestock destined for [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] service.

German [[intelligence officer]] and US citizen Dr. Anton Casimir Dilger established a secret lab in the basement of his sister's home in [[Chevy Chase, Maryland]], that produced glanders which was used to infect livestock in ports and inland collection points including, at least, [[Newport News, Virginia|Newport News]], [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]], [[Baltimore]], and [[New York]], and probably [[St. Louis]] and [[Covington, Kentucky]]. In Argentina, German agents also employed glanders in the port of [[Buenos Aires]] and also tried to ruin wheat harvests with a destructive fungus.

The Geneva Protocol of 1925 prohibited the use of chemical weapons and biological weapons, but said nothing about experimentation, production, storage, or transfer; later treaties did cover these aspects. Twentieth-century advances in microbiology enabled the first pure-culture biological agents to be developed by World War II.

The interwar period was a period of development by many nations, most notably the [[Empire of Japan]]. Secret [[Imperial Japanese Army]] Unit 731, based primarily at [[Pingfan]] in [[Manchuria]] commanded by Lieutenant General [[Shirō Ishii]], did research on BW, conducted often fatal [[human experimentation|human experiments]] on prisoners, and produced biological weapons for combat use during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]].&lt;ref name=Williams1989&gt;{{Citation
|title=Unit 731: Japan's Secret Biological Warfare in World War II |publisher=Free Press |year=1989 |isbn=0029353017|author = Peter Williams &amp; David Wallace}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biological experiments, often using twins with one subject to the procedure and the other as a control, were carried out by [[Nazi Germany]] on [[concentration camp]] inmates, particularly by [[Joseph Mengele]].

;1937–1945
During the [[Sino-Japanese War (1937–1945)]] and [[World War II]], the Imperial Japanese Army made use of biological weapons against both Chinese soldiers and civilians in several military campaigns. Three veterans of Unit 731 testified, in a 1989 interview to the [[Asahi Shimbun]], that they were part of a mission to contaminate the Horustein river with [[typhoid]] near the Soviet troops during the [[Battle of Khalkhin Gol]].&lt;ref&gt;Hal Gold, ''Unit 731 testimony'', 1996, p.64-66&lt;/ref&gt; In 1940, the [[Imperial Japanese Army Air Force]] bombed [[Ningbo]] with ceramic bombs full of [[flea]]s carrying the bubonic plague.&lt;ref&gt;''Japan triggered bubonic plague outbreak, doctor claims'', [http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/japan-triggered-bubonic-plague-outbreak-doctor-claims-704147.html], {{Citation |url= http://www.scaruffi.com/politics/wwii.html|title= A time-line of World War II|accessdate=2008-05-02 |last= Scaruffi |first= Piero|year= 1999|work= |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A film showing this operation was seen by the imperial princes [[Tsuneyoshi Takeda]] and [[Prince Mikasa|Takahito Mikasa]] during a screening made by mastermind Shiro Ishii.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Barenblatt, ''A Plague upon Humanity'', 2004, p.32.&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Khabarovsk War Crime Trials]] the accused, such as Major General Kiyashi Kawashima, testified that as early as 1941 some 40 members of Unit 731 air-dropped plague-contaminated fleas on [[Changde]]. These operations caused epidemic plague outbreaks.&lt;ref name=Barenblatt2004&gt;{{Citation |first=Daniel |last=Barenblatt |title=A Plague upon Humanity |publisher=HarperCollins |year=2004|pages=220–221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many operations were ineffective due to inefficient delivery systems, using disease-bearing insects rather than dispersing the agent as an [[bioaerosol]] cloud.&lt;ref name=Williams1989 /&gt; Nevertheless, some modern Chinese historians estimate that 400,000 Chinese died as a direct result of Japanese field testing and operational use of biological weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Doctors of Depravity |publisher=Daily Mail |author=Christopher Hudson |date=2 March 2007 |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=439776&amp;in_page_id=1770}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1943, following the Allied invasion at [[Battle of Anzio|Anzio]], German forces flooded The [[Pontine Marshes]] to reintroduce [[Malaria]] to the area. Perhaps 100,000 cases of the disease were noted in the region in 1944 and 43,000 in 1945. German forces withheld medical care to the civilian population.&lt;ref&gt;The Third Reich at War, 1939-1945,Richard J Evans, Penguin 2009, Kindle Edition, location 8517-27&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to biological weapons development in Japan, and at the time suspected in Nazi Germany, the United States, [[United Kingdom]], and [[Canada]] initiated a BW development programs in 1941 that resulted in the weaponization of tularemia, [[Anthrax disease|anthrax]], [[brucellosis]], and [[botulism]] toxin.

The center for United States military BW research was [[Fort Detrick, Maryland]], where [[USAMRIID]] is currently based; the first director was pharmaceutical executive [[George W. Merck]]. Some biological and chemical weapons research and testing was also conducted at [[Dugway Proving Ground]]s in [[Utah]], at a munition manufacturing complex in [[Terre Haute, Indiana]], and at a tract on [[Horn Island (Mississippi)|Horn Island]], [[Mississippi]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Alibek&quot;/&gt;

Much of the British work was carried out at Porton Down. Field testing carried out in the United Kingdom during World War II left [[Gruinard island]] in [[Scotland]] contaminated with anthrax for the next 48 years.

;1946 to 1972
During the 1948 [[Israel War of Independence]], [[International Red Cross]] reports raised suspicion that the Jewish [[Haganah]] militia had released [[Salmonella typhi]] bacteria into the water supply for the city of [[Acre, Israel|Acre]], causing an outbreak of typhoid among the inhabitants. Egyptian troops later claimed to have captured disguised Haganah soldiers near wells in [[Gaza strip|Gaza]], whom they executed for allegedly attempting another attack. Israel denies these allegations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/intro/bio-typhoid.htm Typhoid- Biological Weapons&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nti.org/e_research/profiles/Israel/Biological/3652.html NTI: Country Overviews: Israel: Biological Chronology&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Considerable research on the topic was performed by the United States (see [[US Biological Weapon Testing]]), the Soviet Union, and probably other major nations throughout the Cold War era, though it is generally believed that biological weapons were never used after World War II. This view was challenged by China and North Korea, who accused the United States of [[germ warfare in the Korean War]] (1950–1953).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/northkorea/7811949/Did-the-US-wage-germ-warfare-in-Korea.html| author=Julian Ryall| title=Did the US wage germ warfare in Korea?| publisher=The Telegraph| date=June 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of the [[Korean War]] the United States had only weaponized one agent, brucellosis (&quot;Agent US&quot;), which is caused by ''Brucella suis''. The original weaponized form used the M114 bursting bomblet in M33 cluster bombs.

While the specific form of the biological bomb was classified until some years after the Korean War, in the various exhibits of biological weapons that Korea alleged were dropped on their country nothing resembled an [[M114 bomb]]let. There were ceramic containers that had some similarity to Japanese weapons used against the Chinese in World War II, developed by Unit 731.&lt;ref name=Williams1989 /&gt;

Some of the Unit 731 personnel were imprisoned by the Soviets{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}, and would have been a potential source of information on Japanese weaponization. The head of Unit 731, Lieutenant General Shiro Ishii, was granted immunity from war crimes prosecution in exchange for providing information to the United States on the Unit's activities.&lt;ref name=Endicott1998&gt;{{Citation

The Korean War allegations also stressed the use of disease vectors, such as [[fleas]], which, again, were probably a legacy of Japanese biological warfare efforts. The United States initiated its weaponization efforts with disease vectors in 1953, focused on Plague-fleas, EEE-mosquitoes, and yellow fever - mosquitoes (OJ-AP).{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} However, US medical scientists in occupied Japan undertook extensive research on insect vectors, with the assistance of former Unit 731 staff, as early as 1946.&lt;ref name=Endicott1998 /&gt;

The [[United States Air Force]] was not satisfied with the operational qualities of the M114/US and labeled it an interim item until the [[United States Army]] [[Chemical Corps]] could deliver a superior weapon. The Air Force also changed its plans and wanted lethal biologicals.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

The Chemical Corps then initiated a crash program to weaponize anthrax (N) in the E61 1/2-lb hour-glass bomblet. Though the program was successful in meeting its development goals, the lack of validation on the infectivity of anthrax stalled standardization.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

Around 1950 the Chemical Corps also initiated a program to weaponize tularemia (UL). Shortly after the E61/N failed to make standardization, tularemia was standardized in the 3.4&quot; [[M143 bomblet|M143 bursting spherical bomblet]]. This was intended for delivery by the [[MGM-29 Sergeant]] missile warhead and could produce 50% infection over a {{convert|7|sqmi|km2|sing=on}} area. {{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

Unlike anthrax, tularemia had a demonstrated infectivity with human volunteers (Operation Whitecoat). Furthermore, although tularemia is treatable by antibiotics, treatment does not shorten the course of the disease.

In addition to the use of bursting bomblets for creating biological aerosols, the Chemical Corps started investigating aerosol-generating bomblets in the 1950s. The E99 was the first workable design, but was too complex to be manufactured.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} By the late 1950s the 4.5&quot; [[E120 bomblet|E120 spraying spherical bomblet]] was developed; a B-47 bomber with a [[SUU-24/A dispenser]] could infect 50% or more of the population of a {{convert|16|sqmi|km2|sing=on}} area with tularemia with the E120. {{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} The E120 was later superseded by dry-type agents.

Dry-type biologicals resemble [[talcum]] powder, and can be disseminated as aerosols using gas expulsion devices instead of a burster or complex sprayer.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} The Chemical Corps developed [[Flettner rotor bomblet]]s and later triangular bomblets for wider coverage due to improved glide angles over Magnus-lift spherical bomblets.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} Weapons of this type were in advanced development by the time the program ended.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

United States President [[Richard Nixon]] signed an [[Executive order (United States)|executive order]] on November 1969, which stopped production of biological weapons in the United States and allowed only scientific research of lethal biological agents and defensive measures such as [[immunization]] and [[biosafety]]. The biological munition stockpiles were destroyed, and approximately 2,200 researchers became redundant.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alibek&quot;/&gt;

United States Special Forces and the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] also had an interest in biological warfare, and a series of special munitions was created for their operations. {{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} The covert weapons developed for the military (M1, M2, M4, M5, and M32 - or [[Big Five Weapons]]) were destroyed in accordance with Nixon's executive order to end the offensive program. The CIA maintained its collection of biologicals well into 1975 when it became the subject of the senate [[Church Committee]].

;The Biological Weapons Convention
In 1972, the United States signed the Biological and Toxic Weapons Convention, which banned the &quot;development, production and stockpiling of microbes or their poisonous products except in amounts necessary for protective and peaceful research.&quot; By 1996, 137 countries had signed the treaty; however it is believed that since the signing of the Convention the number of countries capable of producing such weapons has increased.

The Soviet Union continued research and production of offensive biological weapons in a program called Biopreparat, despite having signed the convention. The United States was unaware of the program until Dr. Vladimir Pasechnik defected in 1989, and [[Dr. Kanatjan Alibekov]], the first deputy director of Biopreparat defected in 1992.

During the closing stages of the [[Rhodesian Bush War]], the Rhodesian government resorted to biological warfare. Watercourses at several sites close to the Mozambique border were deliberately contaminated with [[cholera]] and the toxin [[Sodium Coumadin]], an anti-coagulant commonly used as the active ingredient in [[Warfarin|rat poison]]. Food stocks in the area were contaminated with [[anthrax]] spores. These biological attacks had little impact on the fighting capability of [[ZANLA]], but caused considerable distress to the local population. Over 10,000 people contracted anthrax in the period 1978 to 1980, of whom 200 died. The facts about this episode became known during the hearings of the South African [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] during the late 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Southern African News Feature:[http://www.sardc.net/editorial/sanf/2001/iss21/specialreport.html the plague wars]&lt;/ref&gt;

After the 1991 Persian [[Gulf War]], Iraq admitted to the [[United Nations]] inspection team to having produced 19,000 liters of concentrated botulinum toxin, of which approximately 10,000 L were loaded into military weapons; the 19,000 liters have never been fully accounted for.

[[Image:Biohazard symbol.svg|thumb|The international [[biological hazard]] symbol]]

Ideal characteristics of a biological agent to be used as a weapon against humans are high [[infectivity]], high [[virulence]], non-availability of [[vaccine]]s, and availability of an effective and efficient [[delivery system]]. Stability of the [[weaponization|weaponized]] agent (ability of the agent to retain its infectivity and virulence after a prolonged period of storage) may also be desirable, particularly for military applications.

The primary difficulty is not the production of the biological agent, as many biological agents used in weapons can often be manufactured relatively quickly, cheaply and easily. Rather, it is the weaponization, storage and delivery in an effective vehicle to a vulnerable target that pose significant problems.

For example, ''[[Bacillus anthracis]]'' is considered an effective agent for several reasons. First, it forms hardy [[spore]]s, perfect for dispersal aerosols. Second, this organism is not considered transmissible from person to person, and thus rarely if ever causes secondary infections. A pulmonary anthrax infection starts with ordinary [[influenza]]-like symptoms and progresses to a lethal [[hemorrhagic]] [[mediastinitis]] within 3–7 days, with a fatality rate that is 90% or higher in untreated patients. Finally, friendly personnel can be protected with suitable [[antibiotic]]s.

A large-scale attack using anthrax would require the creation of aerosol particles of 1.5 to 5 [[Micrometre|microns]]. Too large and the particles would not reach the lower respiratory tract. Too small and the particles would be exhaled back out into the atmosphere. At this size, [[Electrical conductivity|conductive]] powders tend to aggregate because of [[Electric charge|electrostatic charges]], hindering dispersion. So the material must be treated to insulate and neutralize the charges. The weaponized agent must be resistant to degradation by rain and ultraviolet radiation from sunlight, while retaining the ability to efficiently infect the human lung. There are other technological difficulties as well, chiefly relating to storage of the weaponized agent.

Agents considered for weaponization, or known to be weaponized, include bacteria such as ''Bacillus anthracis'', ''[[Brucella]] spp.'', ''[[Burkholderia mallei]]'', ''[[Burkholderia pseudomallei]]'', ''[[Chlamydophila psittaci]]'', ''[[Coxiella burnetii]]'', ''[[Francisella tularensis]]'', some of the [[Rickettsiaceae]] (especially ''[[Rickettsia prowazekii]]'' and ''[[Rickettsia rickettsii]]''), ''[[Shigella]] spp.'', ''[[Vibrio cholerae]]'', and ''[[Yersinia pestis]]''. Many viral agents have been studied and/or weaponized, including some of the [[Bunyaviridae]] (especially [[Rift Valley fever|Rift Valley fever virus]]), [[Ebola]]virus, many of the [[Flaviviridae]] (especially [[Japanese encephalitis|Japanese encephalitis virus]]), [[Bolivian hemorrhagic fever|Machupo virus]], [[Marburg virus]], Variola virus, and [[Yellow fever|Yellow fever virus]]. Fungal agents that have been studied include ''[[Coccidioides]] spp.''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alibek&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6WCJ-4BVPRTS-1&amp;_user=10&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=853a10899e7fadf68b3c6fd459fa2b4a Potential bioweapons]&lt;/ref&gt;

Toxins that can be used as weapons include [[ricin]], [[Staphylococcal Enterotoxin B|staphylococcal enterotoxin B]], [[botulinum toxin]], [[saxitoxin]], and many [[mycotoxin]]s. These toxins and the organisms that produce them are sometimes referred to as [[select agent]]s. In the United States, their possession, use, and transfer are regulated by the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]'s Select Agent Program.

====Anti-agriculture====
'''Anti-crop/anti-vegetation:'''&lt;br&gt;
Biological warfare can also specifically target plants to destroy crops or defoliate vegetation. The United States and Britain discovered plant growth regulators (i.e., [[herbicides]]) during the Second World War, and initiated an [[herbicidal warfare]] program that was eventually used in [[British Malaya|Malaya]] and [[Agent Orange|Vietnam]] in counter insurgency. Though herbicides are chemicals, they are often grouped with biological warfare as [[bioregulator]]s in a similar manner as [[biotoxin]]s.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} Scorched earth tactics or destroying livestock and farmland were carried out in the Vietnam war (cf. Agent Orange)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/3798581.stm|title=Vietnam's war against Agent Orange|date=14 June 2004|accessdate=17 April 2010 | work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sri Lankan Civil War|Eelam War]] in Sri Lanka.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

The United States developed an anti-crop capability during the Cold War that used plant diseases ([[bioherbicide]]s, or [[mycoherbicide]]s) for destroying enemy agriculture. It was believed that destruction of enemy agriculture on a strategic scale could thwart [[Sino-Soviet relations|Sino-Soviet]] aggression in a general war. Diseases such as [[wheat blast]] and [[rice blast]] were weaponized in aerial spray tanks and cluster bombs for delivery to enemy watersheds in agricultural regions to initiate epiphytotics (epidemics among plants). When the United States renounced its offensive biological warfare program in 1969 and 1970, the vast majority of its biological arsenal was composed of these plant diseases.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

'''Anti-livestock:'''&lt;br&gt;
In 1980s Soviet Ministry of Agriculture had successfully developed variants of [[foot-and-mouth disease]], and [[rinderpest]] against [[cow]]s, [[African swine fever]] for [[pig]]s, and [[psittacosis]] to kill [[chicken]]. These agents were prepared to spray them down from tanks attached to airplanes over hundreds of miles. The secret program was code-named &quot;Ecology&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alibek&quot;&gt;[[Kenneth Alibek]] and S. Handelman. ''[[Biohazard (book)|Biohazard: The Chilling True Story of the Largest Covert Biological Weapons Program in the World - Told from Inside by the Man Who Ran it]].'' 1999. Delta (2000) ISBN 0-385-33496-6 [http://www.amazon.com/dp/0385334966/].&lt;/ref&gt;

Attacking animals is another area of biological warfare intended to eliminate animal resources for transportation and food. In the First World War, German agents were arrested attempting to inoculate draft animals with anthrax, and they were believed to be responsible for outbreaks of [[glanders]] in horses and mules. The British tainted small feed cakes with anthrax in the Second World War as a potential means of attacking German cattle for food denial, but never employed the weapon. In the 1950s, the United States had a field trial with [[hog cholera]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} During the [[Mau Mau Uprising]] in [[1952]], the poisonous [[latex]] of the [[Euphorbia grantii|African milk bush]] was used to kill [[cattle]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Biological warfare&quot;&gt;{{Citation| last = Verdourt| first = Bernard| coauthors = E.C. Trump and M.E. Church| title = Common poisonous plants of East Africa| publisher = Collins| year = 1969| location = London| page = 254 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unconnected with inter-human wars, humans have deliberately introduced the rabbit disease [[Myxomatosis]], originating in South America, to [[Australia]] and Europe, with the intention of reducing the rabbit population - which had devastating but temporary results, with wild rabbit populations reduced to a fraction of their former size but survivors developing immunity and increasing again.

====Entomological warfare====
{{Main|Entomological warfare}}

Entomological warfare (EW) is a type of BW that uses [[insect]]s to attack the enemy. The concept has existed for centuries and research and development have continued into the modern era. EW has been used in battle by Japan and several other nations have developed and been accused of using an entomological warfare program. EW may employ [[insect]]s in a direct attack or as vectors to deliver a [[biological agent]], such as [[plague (disease)|plague]] or [[cholera]]. Essentially, EW exists in three varieties. One type of EW involves infecting insects with a [[pathogen]] and then dispersing the insects over target areas.&lt;ref name=sunshine&gt;&quot;[http://www.sunshine-project.org/publications/bk/pdf/bk10en.pdf An Introduction to Biological Weapons, Their Prohibition, and the Relationship to Biosafety]&quot;, ''[[The Sunshine Project]]'', April 2002, accessed December 25, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The insects then act as a [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]], infecting any person or animal they might bite. Another type of EW is a direct insect attack against crops; the insect may not be infected with any pathogen but instead represents a threat to agriculture. The final method uses uninfected insects, such as bees, to directly attack the enemy.&lt;ref&gt;Lockwood, Jeffrey A. ''[[Six-legged Soldiers: Using Insects as Weapons of War]]'', Oxford University Press, USA, 2008, pp. 9&amp;ndash;26, (ISBN 0195333055).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Defensive===
{{Main|Biodefense}}

====Role of public health and disease surveillance====
It is important to note that all of the classical and modern biological weapons organisms are animal diseases, the only exception being smallpox. Thus, in any use of biological weapons, it is highly likely that animals will become ill either simultaneously with, or perhaps earlier than humans.

Indeed, in the largest biological weapons accident known– the anthrax outbreak in Sverdlovsk (now [[Yekaterinburg]]) in the [[Soviet Union]] in 1979, sheep became ill with anthrax as far as 200 kilometers from the release point of the organism from a military facility in the southeastern portion of the city (known as [[Compound 19]] and still off limits to visitors today, see [[Sverdlovsk Anthrax leak]]).

Thus, a robust surveillance system involving human clinicians and veterinarians may identify a bioweapons attack early in the course of an epidemic, permitting the prophylaxis of disease in the vast majority of people (and/or animals) exposed but not yet ill.

For example in the case of anthrax, it is likely that by 24 – 36 hours after an attack, some small percentage of individuals (those with compromised immune system or who had received a large dose of the organism due to proximity to the release point) will become ill with classical symptoms and signs (including a virtually unique [[chest X-ray]] finding, often recognized by public health officials if they receive timely reports). By making these data available to local public health officials in real time, most models of anthrax epidemics indicate that more than 80% of an exposed population can receive antibiotic treatment before becoming symptomatic, and thus avoid the moderately high mortality of the disease.

====Identification of bioweapons====
The goal of [[biodefense]] is to integrate the sustained efforts of the national and homeland security, medical, public health, intelligence, diplomatic, and law enforcement communities. Health care providers and public health officers are among the first lines of defense. In some countries private, local, and provincial (state) capabilities are being augmented by and coordinated with federal assets, to provide layered defenses against biological weapons attacks. During the [[first Gulf War]] the United Nations activated a biological and chemical response team, [[Task Force Scorpio]], to respond to any potential use of weapons of mass destruction on civilians.

The traditional approach toward protecting agriculture, food, and water: focusing on the natural or unintentional introduction of a disease is being strengthened by focused efforts to address current and anticipated future biological weapons threats that may be deliberate, multiple, and repetitive.

The growing threat of biowarfare agents and bioterrorism has led to the development of specific field tools that perform on-the-spot analysis and identification of encountered suspect materials. One such technology, being developed by researchers from the [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] (LLNL), employs a &quot;sandwich immunoassay&quot;, in which fluorescent dye-labeled antibodies aimed at specific [[pathogen]]s are attached to silver and gold nanowires.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.physorg.com/news74433040.html Physorg.com, &quot;Encoded Metallic Nanowires Reveal Bioweapons&quot;, 12:50 EST, August 10, 2006.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Netherlands]], the company [[Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research|TNO]] has designed [[BiosparQ|Bioaerosol Single Particle Recognition eQuipment]] (BiosparQ). This system would be implemented into the national response plan for bioweapons attacks in the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tno.nl/content.cfm?context=markten&amp;content=case&amp;laag1=178&amp;item_id=832 BiosparQ features]&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers at [[Ben Gurion University]] in Israel are developing a different device called the BioPen, essentially a &quot;Lab-in-a-Pen&quot;, which can detect known biological agents in under 20 minutes using an adaptation of the [[ELISA]], a similar widely employed immunological technique, that in this case incorporates fiber optics.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tfot.info/content/view/96/56/ Iddo Genuth and Lucille Fresco-Cohen, &quot;BioPen Senses BioThreats&quot;, ''The Future of Things,'' November 13, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

==List of BW institutions, programs and projects by country==

{{Books of the Old Testament}}
The '''Book of Nehemiah''' is a book of the [[Hebrew Bible]]. Told largely in the form of a first-person memoir, it concerns the rebuilding of the walls of Jerusalem by [[Nehemiah]], a Jew who is a high official at the Persian court, and the dedication of the city and its people to God's laws ([[torah]]). The events take place in the second half of the 5th century BCE, and together with the [[Book of Ezra]], it represents the final chapter in the historical narrative of the [[Hebrew bible]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= The Biblical Period from Abraham to Ezra: An Historical Survey|last= Albright|first= William|authorlink= William F. Albright|year= 1963|publisher= Harpercollins College Div|isbn= 0061301027|url= http://www.amazon.com/Biblical-Period-Abraham-Ezra-Historical/dp/0061301027}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original core of the book, the first-person memoir, may have been combined with the core of the [[Book of Ezra]] around 400 BCE. Sceptics also argue that further editing continued into the Hellenistic era {{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}, but this view is debated {{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}.

The book tells how Nehemiah, at the court of the king in Susa, is informed that Jerusalem is without walls and resolves to restore them. The king appoints him as governor of Judah and he travels to Jerusalem. There he rebuilds the walls, despite the opposition of Israel's enemies, and reforms the community in conformity with the law of Moses. After an absence in Susa he returns to find that the Israelites have been backsliding, taking non-Jewish wives, and stays to enforce the Law.

==Summary==
''For the bible text see [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Nehemiah%201&amp;version=NIV Bible Gateway (opens at NIV version)]''

The book has 13 chapters, mostly in the first person -- these passages are called the Nehemiah Memorandum. It also includes numerous lists, but unlike the [[Book of Ezra]] it contains no quoted documents.

*1. In the 20th year of Artaxerxes (the king of Persia), Nehemiah, cup-bearer to the king in [[Susa]] (the Persian capital), learns that the wall of Jerusalem is destroyed. He prays to God, recalling the sins of Israel and God's promise of restoration in the land, and asks Artaxerxes for leave to return to Jerusalem and rebuild its walls; the king is receptive and extends aid to his mission.
*2. Nehemiah returns to Jerusalem, carrying letters of authorisation from the king; he inspects the walls.
*3. Nehemiah and the Jews (including the 'High Priest' Elyashiv), begin rebuilding Jerusalem.
*4. The enemies of the Jews - Sanballat of Samaria, Tobiah the Ammonite, Geshem the Arab, and the men of Ashdod - plot to attack Jerusalem, and the Jews work with weapons in their hands.
*5. Nehemiah sees that the Jewish nobles are oppressing the poor, and forces the cancellation of all debt and mortgages; while previous governors have been corrupt and oppressive, he has been righteous and just.
*6. Sanballat accuses Nehemiah of planning rebellion against Artaxerxes, and he is opposed even by Jewish nobles and prophets, but the wall is completed.
*7. Nehemiah appoints officials and sets guards on the wall and gates; he plans to register the Jews, and finds the Census of those who had returned earlier.
*8. Nehemiah assembles the people and has Ezra read to them the law-book of Moses; Nehemiah, Ezra and the Levites institute the Feast of Booths, in accordance with the Law.
*9. The Jews assemble in penance and prayer, recalling their past sins, God's help to them, and his promise of the land.
*10. The priests, Levites and people enter into a covenant, agreeing to separate themselves from the surrounding peoples and to keep the Law.
*11. Jerusalem is repopulated from the Jews living in the towns and villages of Judah and Benjamin.
*12. A list of priests and Levites who returned in the days of Cyrus (the first returnees from Babylon); Nehemiah, aided by Ezra, oversees the dedication of the walls and rebuilt city.
*13. After 12 years Nehemiah returns to Susa; he later comes back to Jerusalem, and finds that there has been backsliding in his absence. He takes measures to enforce his earlier reforms and asks for God's favour.

==Historical background==
The book is set in the 5th century. Judah is one of several provinces within the larger satrapy (a large administrative unit) within the Persian empire. The capital of the empire is at [[Susa]]. Nehemiah is a cup-bearer to king Artaxerxes II - an important official position. 

At his own request Nehemiah is sent to Jerusalem as governor of Yehud, the official Persian name for Judah. Jerusalem had been conquered and destroyed by the Babylonians in 586 BCE, and Nehemiah finds it still in ruins. His task is to rebuild the walls and to re-populate the city. He faces opposition from three powerful neighbours, the Samaritans, the Ammonites, and the Arabs, as well as the city of Ashdod, but manages to rebuild the walls. He then purifies the Jewish community by enforcing its segregation from its neighbours and enforces the laws of Moses.

==Textual history==

[[Ezra-Nehemiah]], grouped as a single book with the title &quot;Ezra&quot;, was accepted into the canon of scripture around the middle of the 2nd century BCE, when it was translated into Greek.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com.au/books?id=owwhpmIVgSAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Hebrew+Bible+today:+an+introduction+to+critical+issues&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=fUEuF-W9Ul&amp;sig=YcThOSXuCkrdCzelf6hXPh0_2Mo&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=AOyRTKGFJ4KecIS89MYG&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CBsQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Graham, M.P, and McKenzie, Steven L., &quot;The Hebrew Bible today: an introduction to critical issues&quot; (Westminster John Knox Press, 1998)] p.202&lt;/ref&gt; They were first divided into separate books by the early Christian scholar [[Origen]], in the 3rd century CE, and the separation became entrenched in the 5th century CE when it was followed by [[Jerome]] in his Latin translation of the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com.au/books?id=IfxMeDl6BZgC&amp;dq=The+books+of+Ezra+and+Nehemiah+Fensham&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=bn&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=6sqOTJSYD8mecZbBvK8M&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Fensham, F. Charles, &quot;The books of Ezra and Nehemiah&quot; (Eerdmans, 1982)] p.1&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until the Middle Ages that the separation was introduced into Jewish Bibles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com.au/books?id=nydPyx_n1vYC&amp;pg=PA169&amp;lpg=PA169&amp;dq=Introduction+to+the+Old+Testament%22,+chapter+on+Ezra,+by+T.+Longman+and+R.+Dillard,&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=d5fj7Ku1gQ&amp;sig=yQuKHVv-aRfDGOblBMa9n1EzwLo&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=n1mRTKGDGM6JcIaYjcAB&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Dillard, Raymond B., and Longman, Tremper, &quot;An introduction to the Old Testament&quot; (Zondervan)] p.180&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition and date==

The combined book Ezra-Nehemiah of the earliest Christian and Jewish period was known as Ezra and was probably attributed to him; according to a rabbinic tradition, however, Nehemiah was the real author but was forbidden to claim authorship because of his bad habit of disparaging others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com.au/books?id=m1V1DeBS6P0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Judaism,+the+first+phase:+the+place+of+Ezra+and+Nehemiah+in+the+origins&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=LBwE7k7-kA&amp;sig=op-caFN9i6l1JShKPoRBIIybVsY&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=4kOQTOGVDY2lcaGZ-dwM&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Blenkinsopp, Joseph, &quot;Judaism, the first phase&quot; (Eerdmans, 2009)] p.86&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Nehemiah Memorial, chapters 1-7 and 11-13, may have circulated as an independent work before being combined with the Ezra material to form Ezra-Nehemia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com.au/books?id=6wSWpZmmlAoC&amp;dq=Old+Testament+survey:+the+message,+form,+and+background+of+the+Old+Testament&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=bn&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=zPyRTIKzDcuXcZz0uOUG&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false La Sor, W.S., William Sanford La Sor, Hubbard, D.A., Bush, F.W., &quot;Old Testament survey: the message, form, and background of the Old Testament&quot; (Eerdmans, 1996)]  p.551&lt;/ref&gt; Determining the composition of the Memorial depends on the dates of Nehemiah's mission: It is commonly accepted that &quot;Artaxerxes&quot; was Artaxerxes I (there were two later kings of the same name), and that Nehemiah's first period in Jerusalem was therefore 445-433 BCE;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com.au/books?id=owwhpmIVgSAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Hebrew+Bible+today:+an+introduction+to+critical+issues&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=fUEuF-W9Ul&amp;sig=YcThOSXuCkrdCzelf6hXPh0_2Mo&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=AOyRTKGFJ4KecIS89MYG&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CBsQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Graham, M.P, and McKenzie, Steven L., &quot;The Hebrew Bible today: an introduction to critical issues&quot; (Westminster John Knox Press, 1998)] p.205&lt;/ref&gt; allowing for his return to Susa and second journey to Jerusalem, the end of the 5th century BCE is therefore the earliest possible date for the Memorial.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com.au/books?id=owwhpmIVgSAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Hebrew+Bible+today:+an+introduction+to+critical+issues&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=fUEuF-W9Ul&amp;sig=YcThOSXuCkrdCzelf6hXPh0_2Mo&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=AOyRTKGFJ4KecIS89MYG&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CBsQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Graham, M.P, and McKenzie, Steven L., &quot;The Hebrew Bible today: an introduction to critical issues&quot; (Westminster John Knox Press, 1998)] p.213&lt;/ref&gt; The Nehemiah Memorial is interrupted by chapters 8-10, which concern Ezra. These have sometimes been identified as another, separate work, the Ezra Memorial (EM), but other scholars believe the EM to be fictional and heavily altered by later editors. Both the Nehemiah and Ezra material are combined with numerous lists, Censuses and other material. 

The first edition of the combined Ezra-Nehemiah may date from the early 4th century;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com.au/books?id=6wSWpZmmlAoC&amp;dq=Old+Testament+survey:+the+message,+form,+and+background+of+the+Old+Testament&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=bn&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=zPyRTIKzDcuXcZz0uOUG&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false La Sor, W.S., William Sanford La Sor, Hubbard, D.A., Bush, F.W., &quot;Old Testament survey: the message, form, and background of the Old Testament&quot; (Eerdmans, 1996)] p.551&lt;/ref&gt; further editing continued well into the following centuries.

The '''Book of Jeremiah''' ({{lang-he|ספר יִרְמְיָהוּ}}) is the second of the [[Latter Prophets]] in the [[Hebrew Bible]], following the book of [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] and preceding [[Book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]] and the [[Book of the Twelve]]. (The order is somewhat different in the Christian [[Old Testament]]). It derives its name from, and records the visions of, [[Jeremiah]], who lived in [[Jerusalem]] in the late 7th and early 6th centuries BCE during the time of king [[Josiah]] and the fall of the [[Kingdom of Judah]] to the [[Babylonia]]ns. The book is written in a complex and poetic Hebrew (apart from verse 10:11, curiously written in [[Biblical Aramaic]]).

==Texts and manuscripts==
Parts of the Book of Jeremiah have also been found among the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] in cave 4 in [[Qumran]]. These texts, in Hebrew, correspond both to the Masoretic Text and the Septuagint Text. This discovery has shed much light on the differences between the two versions; while it was previously maintained that the Greek Septuagint (the version used by the earliest Christians) was only a poor translation, professor [[Emanuel Tov]], senior editor of the Dead Sea Scrolls' publication, wrote that the Masoretic edition either represents a substantial rewriting of the original Hebrew, or there had previously been two different versions of the text.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abmc.org/PDFs/Folio_Vol_22_No_2.pdf Tov, Emanuel: &quot;The Septuagint and Literary Criticism&quot;, ''The Folio: Bulletin of the Ancient Biblical Manuscript Center'', 22(2):1-6]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition==
The book of Jeremiah is now accepted to have been edited and influenced by the Deuteronomists, or the writers of the book of [[Deuteronomy]], who advanced religious reform.&lt;ref&gt;Coogan, M. A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament: The Hebrew Bible in its Context. Oxford University Press: Oxford, 2009. p.300.&lt;/ref&gt;  This can be clearly viewed in the parallel use of language found in both Deuteronomy and Jeremiah.&lt;ref&gt;Hyatt, JP. Jeremiah and Deuteronomy. Journal of Near Eastern Studies. Vol. 1, No. 2 (Apr., 1942), pp. 156-173&lt;/ref&gt;  For example in comparing Jer 11.4 and Deut 4.20, both use the metaphor of an iron furnace.  Also, the impetus for religious reform appears to be aligned between Jeremiah and the Deuteronomists in ending of infant child sacrifices (see Jer 7.31, 19.5, 32.35; Lev 18.21).  However, considerable debate exists as to whether Jeremiah was actually a member of the Deuteronomistc school since he does not explicitly mention Deuteronomy or Josiah's religious reform.&lt;ref&gt;Holt, EK. The Chicken and the egg –or was Jeremiah a Member of the Deuteronomist Party?  Journal for the Study of the Old Testament. Vol.44. pp109-122. (1989)&lt;/ref&gt;  In fact, due to the repetitious nature of some of phrases or intertextuality with Jeremiah, an argument has been put forth that the “historical Jeremiah” is hard to validate and should be abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;Carroll, RP. ``Intertextuality and the Book of Jeremiah: Adimadversions on text and theory.'' The New Literary Criticism and the Hebrew Bible. pp. 55-78. 1993.

==Sections of the Book==
The sections of the book can be divided into roughly 6 sections&lt;ref&gt;Coogan, M. A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament: The Hebrew Bible in its Context. Oxford University Press: Oxford, 2009. p299.&lt;/ref&gt; and uses poetic, narrative, and biographical genres that are interspersed throughout the book.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Davidson &quot;Jeremiah, The Book of&quot;   The Oxford Companion to the Bible. Bruce M. Metzger and Michael D. Coogan, eds. Oxford University Press Inc. 1993. Oxford Reference Online. Oxford University Press. Northwestern University.  20 October 2010  [http://www.oxfordreference.com.turing.library.northwestern.edu/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t120.e0371]&lt;/ref&gt;  The breakdown of sections is as follows:

*Chapters 1-25 (The earliest and main core of Jeremiah's message)
*Chapters 26-29 (Biographic material and interaction with other prophets)
*Chapters 30-33 (God's promise of restoration)
*Chapters 34-45 (Mostly interaction with Zedekiah and the fall of Jerusalem)
*Chapters 46-51 (Divine punishment to the nations surrounding Israel)
*Chapter 52 (Appendix that retells 2 Kings 24.18-25.30)

==The Prophet Jeremiah==
{{main|Jeremiah}}

According to the book, the Prophet Jeremiah  was a son of a [[Kohen|priest]] from Anatot in the land of [[Tribe of Benjamin|Benjamin]], who lived in the last years of the [[Kingdom of Judah]] just prior to, during, and immediately after the siege of [[Jerusalem]], culminating in the destruction of [[Solomon's Temple]] and the raiding of the city by [[Nebuchadrezzar II|Nebuchadnezzar]] of [[Babylon]]. According to the book, for a quarter century prior to the destruction, Jeremiah repeatedly issued prophecies predicting God's forthcoming judgment; advocating the Israelites put down their idols and repent in hopes of turning away God's judgment and fulfilling their destiny as his chosen people.  Jeremiah's fellow Israelites refused to heed his warnings and did not repent. His efforts failed and he witnessed the destruction of everything he knew, the [[exile]] of the Israelite elite to Babylonia, and the fleeing of the remainder to Egypt. 

The book of Jeremiah depicts a remarkably introspective prophet, a prophet who was impetuous and often angered by the role into which he has been thrust. Jeremiah alternates efforts to warn the people with pleas to God for mercy until he is ordered to &quot;pray no more for this people.&quot; He engages in extensive [[performance art]], walking about in the streets with a yoke about his neck and engaging in other efforts to attract attention. He is taunted and retaliates; he is thrown in jail as the result. At one point he is thrown into a pit to die.

==Prophecies of Jeremiah==
{{Books of the Old Testament}}
*Threats against the &quot;unfaithful shepherds&quot; (i.e., the false prophets), the promise of peace and of the real shepherd (after 597), and warnings against false prophets and godless priests (perhaps in the time of [[Jehoiakim]]; 23:1-8, 9-40);

*Vision of the two baskets of figs, illustrating the fate of the captives and of those who were left behind, from the period after the first deportation by Nebuchadnezzar, in 597 (chapter 24);

*Threats of punishments to be inflicted on Judah and the surrounding nations, the fourth year of Jehoiakim, i.e., the year of the [[Battle of Carchemish]] (605; chapter 25);

*The first of the historical passages recounting Jeremiah's prophecy in the Temple (compare chapter 7), his arrest, his threatened death, and his rescue, in which connection the martyrdom of the prophet Uriah is briefly mentioned (chapter 26).

*Protection for Israel following the period of destruction and exile

*Utterances from the time of Zedekiah (see § II.), with an appendix, the last connected prophecy of any length, in chapter 35 , treating of the fidelity of the Rechabites and of the unfaithfulness of Judah. This dates from a somewhat earlier period, that of Jehoiakim (because certainly before 597), and thus forms a transition to the first passages of the narrative sections.

Jeremiah's prophecies are noted for the frequent repetitions found in them of the same words, phrases, and imagery. They cover the period of about 50 years. They are not in chronological order.

The [[Septuagint]] ([[Greek language|Greek]] or 'LXX') version of this book is, in its arrangement and in other particulars, different from the [[Masoretic]] Hebrew. The Septuagint does not include 10:6-8; 25:14; 27:19-22; 29:16-20; 33:14-26; 39:4-13; 52:2, 3, 15, 28-30, etc. In all, about 2,700 words found in the Masoretic text are not found in the Septuagint.  Also, the 'Oracles against the Nations', that appear as chapters 46-51 in the Masoretic and most dependent versions, in the Septuagint are located right after 25:13, and in a different order.

According to the [[Jewish Encyclopedia]], ''&quot;a comparison of the Masoretic text with the Septuagint throws some light on the last phase in the history of the origin of the Book of Jeremiah, inasmuch as the translation into Greek was already under way before the work on the Hebrew book had come to an end... The two texts differ above all in that the Septuagint is much shorter... Even if the text of the Septuagint is proved to be the older, it does not necessarily follow that all these variations first arose after the Greek translation had been made, because two different editions of the same text might have been in process of development side by side...&quot;''

The Septuagint version of Jeremiah also includes the [[Book of Baruch]] and the [[Epistle of Jeremiah]].&lt;ref&gt;''An Introduction to the Old Testament in Greek'', [[Henry Barclay Swete]], Cambridge University Press, 1914, Part II, Chapter III, Section 6, [http://rosetta.reltech.org/cgi-bin/Ebind2html/TC/SweteIntro?seq=288], &quot;Baruch and the Epistle of Jeremiah were regarded by the Church as adjuncts of Jeremiah, much in the same way as Susanna and Bel were [[Additions to Daniel|attached to Daniel]]. Baruch and the Epistle occur in lists which rigorously exclude the non-canonical books; they are cited as 'Jeremiah' (Iren. v. 35. I, Tert. scorp. 8, [[Clement of Alexandria]], ''[[Paedagogus]]'' i. 10, [[Cyprian]], ''Testimonia'' ii. 6); with [[Book of Lamentations|Lamentations]] they form a kind of trilogy supplementary to the prophecy.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jerome]]'s [http://www.bombaxo.com/blog/?p=233 Prologue to Jeremiah] says he excluded them: &quot;And the Book of Baruch, his scribe, which is neither read nor found among the Hebrews, we have omitted, standing ready, because of these things, for all the curses from the jealous, to whom it is necessary for me to respond through a separate short work. And I suffer because you think this. Otherwise, for the benefit of the wicked, it was more proper to set a limit for their rage by my silence, rather than any new things written to provoke daily the insanity of the envious.&quot; But the [http://www.bible-researcher.com/trent1.html Canon of Trent] included them as &quot;Ieremias cum Baruch&quot; (Jeremiah with Baruch), {{bibleverse||Baruch|6|NAB}} being the Epistle or Letter of Jeremiah in the [[Vulgate]].

==The “Confessions” of Jeremiah==
Scholars have identified several passages in Jeremiah that can be understood as “confessions;” they occur in the first section of the book (chapters 1-25) and are 11.18-12.6, 15.10-21, 17.14-18, 18.18-23, and 20.7-18. In these passages, Jeremiah expresses his discontent with the message he  is to deliver, but also his steadfast commitment to the divine call despite the fact that he had not sought it out. Additionally, in several of these “confessions,” Jeremiah prays that the Lord will avenge his persecutors  &lt;ref&gt;Coogan, M. A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament: The Hebrew Bible in its Context . Oxford University Press: Oxford, 2009. pp.303.&lt;/ref&gt; (for example, see Jeremiah 12.3).

Jeremiah’s “confessions” are a type of individual [[lament]]. Such laments are found elsewhere in the psalms and the [[book of Job]].  Like Job, Jeremiah curses the day of his birth (Jer.  20.14-18 and Job 3.3-10). Likewise, Jeremiah’s exclamation “For I hear the whispering of many: Terror is all around!” (Jer. 20.10) matches Psalm 31.13 exactly. However, Jeremiah’s laments are made unique by his insistence that he has been called by Yahweh to deliver his messages.&lt;ref&gt;Coogan, M. A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament: The Hebrew Bible in its Context . Oxford University Press: Oxford,  2009. pp.303.&lt;/ref&gt;  These laments that are attributed to Jeremiah “provide a unique look at the prophet's inner struggle with faith, persecution, and human suffering”.&lt;ref&gt;Perdue, Leo G. Harper Collins Study Bible, Revised Edition . HarperCollins: New York,  2006. pp.1021.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prophetic Gestures==
[[Prophetic gestures]], also known as sign-acts or symbolic actions, was a form of communication in which a message was delivered by performing symbolic actions.&lt;ref&gt;Coogan, M. A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament: The Hebrew Bible in its Context . Oxford University Press: Oxford,  2009. p.303.&lt;/ref&gt; These actions were often bizarre actions that violated the cultural norms of the time (e.g. lying on one's left side for 390 days only turn over and lie on one's right side for another 40- Ezekiel 4:4-8). These actions served the purposes of both drawing audience and causing that audience to ask questions, giving a prophet the opportunity to explain the meaning of the behavior. Prophetic gestures are not unique to the book of Jeremiah.

The following is a list of noteworthy sign-acts found in Jeremiah.
*'''Jeremiah 13:1-11''' The wearing, burial, and retrieval of a linen waistband.&lt;ref&gt;Friebel, K.G. Jeremiah's and Ezekiel's Sign-Acts. Sheffield Academic Press: Sheffield, England, 1999. pp. 99-114&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Jeremiah 16:1-9''' The shunning of the expected customs of marriage, mourning, and general celebration.&lt;ref&gt;Friebel, K.G. Jeremiah's and Ezekiel's Sign-Acts. Sheffield Academic Press: Sheffield, England, 1999. pp. 82-99&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Jeremiah 19:1-13''' the acquisition of a clay jug and the breaking of said jug in front of the religious leaders of Jerusalem &lt;ref&gt;Friebel, K.G. Jeremiah's and Ezekiel's Sign-Acts. Sheffield Academic Press: Sheffield, England, 1999. pp. 115-124&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Jeremiah 27-28''' The wearing of an oxen yoke and its subsequent breaking by a fellow prophet, Hananiah.&lt;ref&gt;Friebel, K.G. Jeremiah's and Ezekiel's Sign-Acts. Sheffield Academic Press: Sheffield, England, 1999. pp. 136-&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Jeremiah 35:1-19''' The offering of wine to the Rechabites, a tribe known for living in tents and refusing to drink wine. This was done in the Temple, which is an important part of the breaking of societal norms.&lt;ref&gt;Friebel, K.G. Jeremiah's and Ezekiel's Sign-Acts. Sheffield Academic Press: Sheffield, England, 1999. pp. 124-136&lt;/ref&gt;

This is not an exhaustive list of the prophetic gestures found in the book of Jeremiah. It is important in one's reading of the text of Jeremiah that one remember that the recorder of these events (i.e. the author of the text) had neither the same audience nor, potentially, the same intent that Jeremiah had in performing these prophetic gestures.&lt;ref&gt;Friebel, K.G. Jeremiah's and Ezekiel's Sign-Acts. Sheffield Academic Press: Sheffield, England, 1999. p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; This is also true of most other texts containing prophetic gestures.

{{Tanakh OT}}
{{Books of the Old Testament}}

The '''Book of Isaiah''' ({{lang-he| ספר ישעיה}}) is the first of the [[Latter Prophets]] in the [[Hebrew Bible]], preceding the books of [[Book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]], [[book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]] and the [[Book of the Twelve]]. (The order is somewhat different in the Christian [[Old Testament]]).

The book has 66 chapters: the first 39 chapters prophesy doom for a sinful [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]] and for all the nations of the world that oppose God, while the last 27 prophesy the restoration of the nation of Israel and a new creation in God's glorious future kingdom;&lt;ref name = &quot;May Metzger&quot; /&gt; this section includes the [[Songs of the Suffering Servant]], four separate passages referring to the nation of Israel, interpreted by [[Christian]]s as [[Typology (theology)|prefiguring]] the coming of [[Jesus Christ]].&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/982919.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Tradition ascribes the book to Isaiah himself, but for over a hundred years scholars have divided it into three parts: Proto-Isaiah (chapters 1-39), containing the words of the 8th century BCE prophet and 7th century BCE expansions; Deutero-Isaiah (chapters 40-55), a 6th century BCE work by an author who wrote under the [[Babylonian captivity]]; and Trito-Isaiah (chapters 56-66), composed probably by multiple authors in Jerusalem shortly after the exile.&lt;ref name = &quot;May Metzger&quot;&gt;May, Herbert G. and Bruce M.

==Texts and manuscripts==

The oldest surviving manuscript of Isaiah was found among the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]]: dating from about a century before the time of Jesus, it is substantially identical with the [[Masoretic]] version which forms the basis of most modern English-language versions of the book.&lt;ref name=&quot;goldingay&quot;&gt;Goldingay, John, ''Isaiah''. New International Biblical Commentary Old Testament Series. Peabody, Massachusetts: Hendrickson Publishers, 2001 ISBN 0-85364-734-8.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|pp.22-23}} (Isaiah was the most popular prophet among the Dead Sea collection: 21 copies of the scroll were found in Qumran.)&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt;

==Composition==
[[Image:1QIsa b.jpg|thumb|right|A fragment of the Book of Isaiah found among the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]].]]

Jewish and Christian tradition held that the entire book is by the 8th century BCE prophet Isaiah, but scholars have held since the late 19th century that it cannot be by a single author.&lt;ref name=&quot;sweeney&quot;&gt;Sweeney, Marvin A., ''Isaiah 1-4 and the post-exilic understanding of the Isaianic tradition'', Beiheft zur Zeitscrift für die alttestamentliche Wissenschaft 171. Berlin &amp; New York: de Gruyter, 1988 ISBN 0899254047.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|p.1}} The observations which have led to this conclusion are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages=172|first=Harlan|last=Creelman|title=An Introduction to the Old Testament |publisher=The Macmillan company |year=1917}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Prophecies → Passages of Isaiah 40-66 refer to events that did not occur in Isaiah's own lifetime, such as the rise of Babylon as the world power, the destruction of Jerusalem, and the rise of [[Cyrus the Great]]. ([[R. N. Whybray]] notes that Deutero-Isaiah's prediction that Cyrus would destroy Babylon - in fact he made it more splendid than ever - further pinpoints the time in which the author wrote.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.ca/books?id=QMENImo6ISYC&amp;pg=PA10] Whybray, Roger Norman, ''The second Isaiah'', Sheffield, England: Sheffield Academic Press, 1983 ISBN 0-567-08424-8, page 10.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Anonymity → Isaiah’s name suddenly stops being used after chapter 39.
*Style → There is a sudden change in style and theology after chapter 40;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bromiley&quot;&gt;{{cite book|pages=895–895|first=Geoffrey W.|last=Bromiley|title=The international standard Bible encyclopedia |isbn=9780802837820 |year=1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; numerous key words and phrases found in one section are not found in the other.&lt;ref name=&quot;mercer&quot;&gt;[http://books.google.ca/books?id=goq0VWw9rGIC&amp;pg=PA414 Mercer dictionary of the Bible]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Historical Situation → The historical situation goes through three stages: in chapters 1-39 the prophet speaks of a judgment which will befall the wicked Israelites; in chapters 40-55 the destruction of Jerusalem and the Temple (587 BCE) is treated as an accomplished fact and the fall of Babylon as an imminent threat; and in chapters 56-66 the fall of Babylon is already in the past.&lt;ref name=&quot;mercer&quot;/&gt;

Scholars therefore divide the book into three parts:&lt;ref name=&quot;Boadt&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Reading the Old Testament: An Introduction| authorlink=Lawrence Boadt | first=Lawrence|last=Boadt |year=1984 |isbn=9780809126316}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Chapters 40 to 55 (''Second Isaiah'' or ''Deutero-Isaiah''): by an anonymous author who lived in Babylon near the end of the [[Babylonian captivity]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Boadt&quot; /&gt;{{rp|418}}
* Chapters 56 to 66 (''Third Isaiah'' or ''Trito-Isaiah''): the work of anonymous disciples committed to continuing Isaiah's work in the years immediately after the return from Babylon.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boadt&quot; /&gt;{{rp|444}} This section includes visions of new heavens and new earth.&lt;ref name=&quot;CSB&quot; /&gt; (Other scholars suggest that chapters 55-66 were written by Deutero-Isaiah after the fall of Babylon.)&lt;ref name=&quot;Kugel&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|p. 561}}

This implied sequence of pre-[[Babylonian Captivity|exilic]], exilic and post-exilic material is somewhat misleading, as significant editing has clearly taken place in all three parts.&lt;ref name=&quot;blenkinsopp&quot;&gt;Blenkinsopp, Joseph, ''A history of prophecy in Israel'', Louisville, Kentucky: Westminster John Knox, revised edition,1996 ISBN 0664256392&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|p.183}} There is some uncertainty as to how Deutero-Isaiah and Trito-Isaiah came to be attached to the original Isaiah: the two competing theories are either that Deutero-Isaiah was written as a continuation of Proto-Isaiah, or that it was written separately and became attached to the famous Isaiah later.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com.au/books?id=Z9zLXRhNl9MC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+prophetic+literature:+an+introduction&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=x2k5u1yeaq&amp;sig=O9v3Gi-T2rNOQPRPIwrD2jdfM6A&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=cSufTMGaHZDCcaHMudIJ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Petersen, David L., &quot;The prophetic literature: an introduction&quot; (Westminster John Knox, 2002)] p.48&lt;/ref&gt;

===Authorship and historical background===

Isaiah's first significant acts as a prophet occurred when Judah, under king [[Ahaz]], faced invasion from [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]] and [[Aram Damascus]] (Syria) after refusing to join them in a revolt against [[Assyria]], the dominant imperial power of the age. Ahaz, against Isaiah's advice to seek the protection of God, invited the Assyrians to protect him, turning Judah into an Assyrian vassal. Israel (the northern kingdom) was consequently destroyed by the Assyrians. On the death of Ahaz, c.715 BCE, his son [[Hezekiah]] followed a policy which Isaiah saw as dangerous, waging war on the Philistine cities and on Edom even though territory under direct Assyrian control (i.e., the former kingdom of Israel) now came to within a few miles of Jerusalem. Isaiah's warning that Judah would meet the same fate as Israel was ignored. Eventually Hezekiah revolted against Assyria, and as Isaiah had predicted the country was ravaged by Assyrian armies. Hezekiah then took Isaiah's advice and threw himself on the protection of God, and Jerusalem was saved.&lt;ref name=&quot;blenkinsopp&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|pp.100-107}}

===Content and structure===
Proto-Isaiah is divided between verse and prose passages: a currently popular theory is that the verse passages represent the prophecies of the original Isaiah, while the prose sections are &quot;sermons&quot; on his texts composed at the court of [[Josiah]], at the end of the 7th century BCE.&lt;ref name=&quot;goldingay&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|p.4}} Chapters 7, 21, and 36-39 appear also in [[Books of Kings|2nd Kings]]: it is not known whether the author of Isaiah borrowed them from Kings, or vice-versa.&lt;ref name=&quot;goldingay&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|p.3}} Chapters 24-27, known as the &quot;Isaiah [[Apocalyptic literature|Apocalypse]]&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;pages 432-433, Michael D.

Chapters 1-5 and 28-29 prophesy judgment against Judah.  Judah thinks itself safe because of its covenant relationship with God.  However, God tells Judah (through Isaiah) that the covenant cannot protect them when they have broken it by the worship of other gods and by acts of injustice and cruelty, which oppose God's law. Chapter 6 describes Isaiah's call to be a prophet of God, and chapters 7-23 contain prophecies against Judah's enemies. Chapters 24-34, while too complex to characterize easily, are primarily concerned with prophecies of a &quot;[[Messiah]]&quot;, a person anointed or given power by God, and of the Messiah's kingdom, where justice and righteousness will reign. Chapters 36-39 concern [[Hezekiah]]'s triumph over the Assyrians and his faith in God. It ends with a visit to Hezekiah by envoys from a rebel prince of Babylon, and Isaiah's words prophesying the Babylonian exile.

==Deutero-Isaiah (Isaiah 40-55)==
''[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2040&amp;version=NIV Isaiah 40 at Bible Gateway]''

===Authorship and historical background===
Two crises occurred between Proto-Isaiah and Deutero-Isaiah. The first was the late 7th century [[Deuteronomist]]ic reform of official Judean religion under king [[Josiah]], who banned many elements of the old polytheistic cult from the Temple, and the sudden collapse of Assyria and the rise of Babylon to take its place; the second was exile of the royal court, the priests and other members of the ruling elite following the Babylonian destruction of Jerusalem c.586 BCE. It is widely believed that Deutero-Isaiah delivered his prophesies to this group, which was actually quite small - the majority of the population stayed in Judah.

By the middle of the 6th century the king of Babylon was [[Nabonidus]]. He alienated the powerful priests of [[Marduk]], the official god of Babylon, by taking up the worship of [[Sin (mythology)|Sin]], the god of Harran (a city in northern Mesopotamia), absenting himself for long periods from the city and neglecting crucial ceremonies. He also neglected the rise of powerful new enemies, first the [[Medes]], then the Persians under [[Cyrus the Great]]. In 550 BCE Cyrus defeated the Medes, and had allied himself with the priests of Marduk, and the fall of Babylon to the Persians became a real possibility. These events date Deutero-Isaiah's earlier prophecies. Chapters 49-55 probably come from a slightly later period, after Babylon had fallen to Cyrus and the return to Jerusalem became a real possibility.&lt;ref name=&quot;barker&quot;&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=2Vo-11umIZQC&amp;pg=PA535&amp;dq=Hezekiah+royal+high+priest&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=iPQBTciwOoqmvgPoj73NBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Hezekiah%20royal%20high%20priest&amp;f=false Barker, Margaret, &quot;Isaiah&quot;, pages 489-542 in Dunn, James D.

===Content and structure===
{{seealso|Isaiah 53}}
Deutero-Isaiah prophesies the deliverance of Israel from the hands of the Babylonians and their restoration in the land promised to them by God. It affirms that the Jews are indeed the chosen people of God and [[YHWH|Yahweh]] is both their [[national god]] and the God of the universe (46:9). [[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus]] is named as the messiah who will overthrow Babylon and allow the return of Israel (chapter 45:1). The remaining chapters are a vision of the future glory of [[Zion]].  A &quot;suffering servant&quot; is referred to (esp. ch. 53) - probably a metaphor for Israel, Christians have traditionally interpreted it as a prophecy of Jesus as the [[Christ]] (i.e., Messiah).&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;&quot;Servant Songs.&quot; Cross, F. L., ed. The Oxford dictionary of the Christian church. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapters 40-55 fall into two parts, with 40-48 dealing with the rise of Cyrus, while 49-55 are focused on Zion as the wife whom God has renounced and then taken back. The Cyrus chapters are similar in style and theme to the [[Cyrus cylinder]], and it is possible that Deutero-Isaiah was influenced by the propaganda of Cyrus and his supporters, who claimed that the god [[Marduk]] had chosen Cyrus to liberate Babylon.&lt;ref name=&quot;barker&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|p.524}}

==Trito-Isaiah (Isaiah 56-66)==
''[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+56&amp;version=NIV Isaiah 56 at Bible Gateway]''

===Authorship and historical background===
[[Cyrus the Great]], the Persian king, conquered Babylon in 539 BCE. One of his first acts was to allow peoples exiled by the Babylonians (the policy had affected more people than just the Jews) to return to their homes. The Jews, or at least some of them, returned to Jerusalem, and by 515 BCE had rebuilt the Temple. The return, however, was not without problems of its own: the returnees found themselves in conflict with those Jews who had remained in the country and who now owned the land, and there was further conflicts over the form of government that should be set up. This was the background to Trito-Isaiah, who was probably not a single author but a group under the influence of Deutero-Isaiah and his followers.

===Content and structure===
Trito-Isaiah is not a unity: the majority of scholars regard it as an anthology of about twelve passages, differing in date and/or purpose,&lt;ref name=&quot;soggin&quot;&gt;Soggin, J. Alberto, ''Introduction to the Old Testament: from its origins to the closing of the Alexandrian canon''. Old Testament Library. Louisville: Westminster John Knox Press, 3rd edition, 1989 ISBN 0664213316. Translation of the 4th edition of ''Introduzione all'Antico Testamento''&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|p.394}} and it may include material from the First Temple period.&lt;ref name=&quot;blenkinsopp&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|p.183}} The contents are correspondingly varied: a confession of sin and a plea to God not to maintain his anger forever (ch.63:7-64:11); a poem on the theme that God has no need of a temple because Heaven is his throne and Earth his footstool(Isaiah 66:1-2); verses setting out conditions for admission to the community; complaints of sin, incompetence and paganism; and distinctions between the &quot;righteous&quot; and the &quot;sinners&quot;, foreshadowing the categories used in much later Judaism and early Christianity.&lt;ref name=&quot;soggin&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|pp.394-5}}

==Themes in Deutero-Isaiah (Second Isaiah)==
[[Image:Isaiah Wall.jpg|thumb|right|Isaiah 2:4 is taken as an unofficial mission statement by the [[United Nations]]. (Isaiah Wall in [[Ralph Bunche Park]], a [[New York City]] park near [[United Nations Headquarters|UN headquarters]])]]

===The Servant of Yahweh===
{{main|Servant songs}}
Second Isaiah contains four passages of “songs of the servant of Yahweh.”

1) 1st	/ Isa 42:1-4		The servant is the chosen one, given the Spirit to establish justice through the world

2) 2nd	/ Isa 49:1-6		The servant speaks to the entire world and identifies himself as one called by God before birth

3) 3rd	/ Isa 50:4-11		The servant declares his confidence in divine help even in the face of physical persecution

4) 4th	/ Isa 52:13-53:12	The suffering of the servant; how despite his innocence the servant was oppressed “like a lamb that is led to the slaughter,” but his suffering is surrogate like a [[Scapegoating|scapegoat]].

The &quot;servant of Yahweh&quot; can be interpreted as any of three plausible characters: the first is an individual chosen by God, like [[Moses]], [[Hezekiah]], [[Josiah]], [[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus]], etc., who is identified as a messianic figure of the future. The second is Israel itself as a personified nation, as shown in Isaiah 49:3 and the third is the remnant of the First Isaiah, the restored Israel from the exile (Isa 46:3).&lt;ref&gt;Michael D. Coogan, &quot;A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament&quot; page 334-335, Oxford University Press, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Monotheism===
Isaiah 44:6 contains the first clear statement of [[monotheism]] in the Hebrew scriptures: &quot;I am the first and I am the last; besides me there is no god&quot;. In Isaiah 44:09-20 this is developed into a satire on the making and worship of idols, mocking the foolishness of the carpenter who worships the idol that he himself has carved. While Yahweh had shown his superiority to other gods before, in Second Isaiah he becomes the sole God of the world. This model of monotheism became the defining characteristic of post-Exilic [[Judaism]], and became the basis for Christianity and Islam.&lt;ref&gt;Michael D. Coogan, &quot;A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament&quot; pages 335-336, Oxford University Press, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===A New Exodus===
A central theme in Second Isaiah is that of a new Exodus - the return of the exiled people Israel from Babylon to Jerusalem. The author imagines a ritualistic return to Zion (Judah) led by Yahweh.  The importance of this theme is indicated by its placement at the beginning and end of Second Isaiah (40:3-5, 55:12-13). This new Exodus is repeatedly linked with Israel's [[The Exodus|Exodus]] from Egypt to Canaan under divine guidance, but with new elements. These links include the following:
*The original Exodus participants left &quot;in great haste&quot; (Ex 12:11, Deut 16:3), whereas the participants in this new Exodus will &quot;not go out in great haste&quot; (Isa 52:12).
*The land between Egypt and Canaan of the first Exodus was a &quot;great and terrible wilderness, an arid wasteland&quot; (Deut 8:15), but in this new Exodus, the land between Babylon (Mesopotamia) and the Promised Land will be transformed into an paradise, where the mountains will be lowered and the valleys raised to create level road (Isa 40:4).
*In the first Exodus, water was provided by God, but scarcely.  In the new Exodus, God will &quot;make the wilderness a pool of water, and the dry land springs of water&quot; (Isa 41:18).&lt;ref&gt;Michael D. Coogan, A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament (New York: Oxford, 2009), 333&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other Themes in the Book of Isaiah==
===Ethical behaviour===
Isaiah is concerned with the connection between worship and ethical behavior.  One of his major themes is Yahweh's refusal to accept the ritual worship of those who are treating others with [[cruelty]] and injustice.

===Idolatry===
Isaiah speaks also of [[idolatry]], which was common at the time.  The Canaanite worship, which involved fertility rites, including sexual practices forbidden by [[Jewish law]], had become popular among the Jewish people.  Isaiah picks up on a theme used by other prophets and tells [[Judah (biblical figure)|Judah]] that the nation of Israel is like a wife who is committing adultery, having run away from her true husband, YHWH.

===The nature of God===
An important theme is that YHWH is the God of the whole earth.  Many gods of the time were believed to be local gods or national gods who could participate in warfare and be defeated by each other. The concern of these gods was the protection of their own particular nations.

No one can defeat YHWH; if YHWH's people suffer defeat in battle, it is only because he permits it to happen.  Furthermore, Yahweh is concerned with more than the Jewish people. He has called Judah and Israel his covenant people for the specific purpose of teaching the world about himself.

===&quot;Holy One of Israel&quot;===
A unifying theme found throughout the Book of Isaiah is the use of the expression of &quot;the Holy One of Israel&quot;. It is found 12 times in chapters 1-39 and 14 times in chapters 40-66. This expression appears only 6 times within the [[Old Testament]] outside the book of Isaiah.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

===Kingdom of Yahweh===
A final thematic goal that Isaiah constantly leans toward throughout the writing is the establishment of Yahweh's kingdom on earth, where those who love Him live to serve His everlasting good will.

==Influence on Christianity==
[[Image:William Strutt Peace 1896.jpg|thumb|right|''Peace'', 1896 etching by [[William Strutt]], based upon Isaiah 11:6,7]]

Isaiah is the most quoted of all the books of the Hebrew Bible outside of the Torah.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crossway.org/blog/2006/03/nt-citations-of-ot/ New Testament Citations of the Old Testament by Crossway]&lt;/ref&gt; Of notable importance is [[Isaiah 7:14]], where the prophet is assuring king [[Ahaz]] that God will save Judah from the invading armies of Israel and Syria; the sign that will prove this is the forthcoming birth of a child called Emmanuel, &quot;God With Us&quot;. While it is suggested by the grammar of the Hebrew that the &quot;young woman&quot; is already pregnant and hence not a virgin,&lt;ref&gt;The Second Jewish Book Of Why by Alfred Kolatch 1985&lt;/ref&gt; the Greek-speaking 1st century CE author of Matthew 1:23 interpreted it as a prophecy that the [[messiah]] would be born of a virgin.

Another important passage was Isaiah 40:3-5, which imagines the exiled Israel proceeding home to Jerusalem on a newly-constructed road, led by the victorious [[Yahweh]] who has conquered the gods of Babylon. The vision was taken up by all four Gospels and applied to [[John the Baptist]] and Jesus, leading God's people out of exile.&lt;ref&gt;Brueggemann p.174&lt;/ref&gt;

Isaiah 52:13-53:12, the fourth of the &quot;[[Suffering Servant]]&quot; songs, was interpreted by the earliest Christians as a prophecy of the death and exaltation of Jesus, a role which Jesus himself seems to have accepted (Luke 4:17-21).&lt;ref name=&quot;barker&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|pp.534-5}}

== Jehovah's Witnesses adoption of Isaiah 43:10-12 ==

The Bible-based name [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] identifies these Christians as a 'people for God's name.' The name Jehovah's witnesses, based on Isaiah 43:10–12, was adopted in 1931. At Isaiah 43:10, as per [[New World Translation]] reads: &quot;'You are my witnesses,' is the utterance of [[Jehovah]], 'even my servant whom I have chosen.'&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[mathematics]], a '''bilinear operator''' is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] combining elements of two [[vector space]]s to yield an element of a third vector space that is [[Linear map|linear]] in each of its arguments. [[Matrix multiplication]] is an example.

==Definition==
Let ''V'', ''W'' and ''X'' be three [[vector space]]s over the same base [[field (mathematics)|field]] ''F''. A bilinear map is a [[function (mathematics)|function]]
:''B'' : ''V'' &amp;times; ''W'' &amp;rarr; ''X''
such that for any ''w'' in ''W'' the map
:''v'' {{mapsto}} ''B''(''v'', ''w'')
is a [[linear map]] from ''V'' to ''X'', and for any ''v'' in ''V'' the map
:''w'' {{mapsto}} ''B''(''v'', ''w'')
is a linear map from ''W'' to ''X''. 

In other words, if we hold the first entry of the bilinear map fixed, while letting the second entry vary, the result is a linear operator, and similarly if we hold the second entry fixed.

If ''V'' = ''W'' and we have ''B''(''v'',''w'') = ''B''(''w'',''v'') for all ''v'',''w'' in ''V'', then we say that ''B'' is ''[[symmetric function|symmetric]]''.

The case where ''X'' is ''F'', and we have a '''[[bilinear form]]''', is particularly useful (see for example [[scalar product]], [[inner product]] and [[quadratic form]]).

The definition works without any changes if instead of vector spaces we use [[module (mathematics)|modules]] over a [[commutative ring]] ''R''. It also can be easily generalized to ''n''-ary functions, where the proper term is ''[[Multilinear map|multilinear]]''.

For the case of a non-commutative base ring ''R'' and a right module ''M&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;'' and a left module ''&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;N'', we can define a bilinear map ''B'' : ''M'' &amp;times; ''N'' → ''T'', where ''T'' is an abelian [[group (mathematics)|group]], such that for any ''n'' in ''N'', ''m'' → ''B''(''m'', ''n'') is a group homomorphism, and for any ''m'' in ''M'', ''n'' → ''B''(''m'', ''n'') is a group homomorphism too, and which also satisfies

:''B''(''mt'', ''n'') = ''B''(''m'', ''tn'')

for all ''m'' in ''M'', ''n'' in ''N'' and ''t'' in ''R''.

==Properties==
A first immediate consequence of the definition is that &lt;math&gt;B(x,y)=o&lt;/math&gt;
whenever ''x''=o or ''y''=o. (This is seen by writing the [[null vector]] ''o'' as 0·''o'' and moving the scalar 0 &quot;outside&quot;, in front of ''B'', by linearity.)

The set ''L(V,W;X)'' of all bilinear maps is a [[linear subspace]] of the space ([[viz.]] [[vector space]], [[module (mathematics)|module]]) of all maps from ''V''×''W'' into ''X''.

[[image:FourfacesofBilinaearmaps.PNG|thumb|320px|A matrix ''M'' determines a bilinear map into the real by means of a real-bilinear-form &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle(v,w)\mapsto v'Mw&lt;/math&gt;, then [[metric tensor|associates]]  of this are taken to the other three possibilities using [[dual space|duality]] and the [[musical isomorphism]]]]

If ''V'',''W'',''X'' are [[finite-dimensional]], then so is ''L(V,W;X)''. For ''X=F'', i.e. bilinear forms, the dimension of this space is dim''V''×dim''W'' (while the space ''L(V×W;K)'' of ''linear'' forms is of dimension dim''V''+dim''W''). To see this, choose a [[Basis (linear algebra)|basis]] for ''V'' and ''W''; then each bilinear map can be uniquely represented by the matrix &lt;math&gt;B(e_i,f_j)&lt;/math&gt;, and vice versa. 
Now, if ''X'' is a space of higher dimension, we obviously have dim''L(V,W;X)''=dim''V''×dim''W''×dim''X''.

== Examples ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Multilinear map]] --&gt;
* [[matrix (mathematics)|Matrix multiplication]] is a bilinear map M(''m'',''n'') &amp;times; M(''n'',''p'') → M(''m'',''p'').
* If a [[vector space]] ''V'' over the [[real number]]s '''R''' carries an [[inner product space|inner product]], then the inner product is a bilinear map ''V'' &amp;times; ''V'' → '''R'''.
* In general, for a vector space ''V'' over a field ''F'', a [[bilinear form]] on ''V'' is the same as a bilinear map ''V'' &amp;times; ''V'' → ''F''.
* If ''V'' is a vector space with [[dual space]] ''V*'', then the application operator, ''b''(''f'', ''v'') = ''f''(''v'') is a bilinear map from ''V''* &amp;times; ''V'' to the base field.
* Let ''V'' and ''W'' be vector spaces over the same base field ''F''. If ''f'' is a member of ''V''* and ''g'' a member of ''W''*, then ''b''(''v'', ''w'') = ''f''(''v'')''g''(''w'') defines a bilinear map ''V'' &amp;times; ''W'' → ''F''.
* The [[cross product]] in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; is a bilinear map '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;times; '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; → '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.
* Let ''B'' : ''V'' &amp;times; ''W'' → ''X'' be a bilinear map, and ''L'' : ''U'' → ''W'' be a [[linear map]], then (''v'', ''u'') → ''B''(''v'', ''Lu'') is a bilinear map on ''V'' &amp;times; ''U''
* The [[zero function|null map]], defined by &lt;math&gt;B(v,w) = 0&lt;/math&gt; for all (''v'',''w'') in ''V''×''W'' is the only map from ''V''×''W'' to ''X'' which is bilinear and linear at the same time. Indeed, if (''v,w'')∈''V''×''W'', then if ''B'' is linear, &lt;math&gt;B(v,w)= B(v,0)+B(0,w)=0+0&lt;/math&gt; if ''B'' is bilinear.

''' &quot;Blind&quot; Blake''' (born '''Arthur Blake''', circa 1893, [[Jacksonville, Florida]]; died: circa 1933) was an influential [[blues]]/[[ragtime]] [[singer]] and [[guitarist]]. He is often called &quot;The King of Ragtime Guitar&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

==Biography==
Blind Blake recorded about 80 tracks for [[Paramount Records]] between 1926 and 1932.&lt;ref name=&quot;russell&quot;&gt;{{cite book
| first= Tony
| last= Russell
| year= 1997
| title= The Blues - From Robert Johnson to Robert Cray
| edition= 
| publisher=Carlton Books Limited 
| location= Dubai
| pages= 93–94
| isbn= 1-85868-255-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of the most accomplished [[guitar]]ists of his genre with a surprisingly diverse range of material. He is best known for his distinct guitar sound that was comparable in sound and style to a [[ragtime]] [[piano]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gracyk.com/blake1.shtml ''The King Of Ragtime Guitar: Blind Blake &amp; His Piano-Sounding Guitar'' by Jas Obrecht]&lt;/ref&gt;

Little is known about his life. His birthplace was listed as [[Jacksonville, Florida]] by Paramount Records but that is not firmly established.&lt;ref name=&quot;russell&quot;/&gt; On one [[sound recording and reproduction|recording]] he slipped into a [[Geechee]] dialect, prompting speculation that he was from the [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] coastal region. Nothing is definitely known of his death and even his name is not certain. According to one source, his real name was '''Arthur Phelps''', although concrete evidence for this claim is lacking.&lt;ref name=&quot;Balfour&quot;&gt;Balfour, Alan. CD liner notes. ''Blind Blake, Complete Recorded Works In Chronological Order, Volume 4, August 1929 to June 1932''. DOCD–5027. Document Records, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; The &quot;Phelps&quot; name theory was entirely based on a response given by [[Blind Willie McTell]] in an interview conducted in 1955 in Atlanta, where Blake has never been reported; nor did McTell ever reside in Chicago. Recent research has discovered that many of Blind Blake's recordings were copyrighted under the name 'Arthur Blake', and in his two-part recording with [[Papa Charlie Jackson]], &quot;Papa Charlie and Blind Blake Talk About It&quot;, the following dialogue is heard:&lt;blockquote&gt;Jackson: What is your right name?&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Blake: My right name is Arthur Blake!&lt;ref name=&quot;Balfour&quot; /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;There is only one surviving [[photograph]] of him in existence.

His first recordings were made in 1926 and his [[Gramophone record|records]] sold very well. His first [[solo (music)|solo]] record was &quot;Early Morning Blues&quot; with &quot;West Coast Blues&quot; on the [[A-side and B-side|B-side]]. Both are considered excellent examples of his ragtime-based guitar style and are prototypes for the burgeoning [[Piedmont blues]]. Blake made his last recordings in 1932, the end of his career aided by Paramount's [[bankruptcy]]. It is often said that the later recordings have much less sparkle. Stefan Grossman and Gayle Dean Wardlow think its possible that only one side of Blake's last [[gramophone record|record]] is actually by him.&lt;ref&gt;Jas Obrecht 1993&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Champagne Charlie Is My Name&quot; does not actually sound like Blake's playing or singing. Allegedly, Blind Blake was drinking heavily in his final years. It is likely that this led to his early death at only 40 years old. The exact circumstances of his death are not known; [[Reverend Gary Davis]] said in an interview that he had heard Blake was killed by a [[Tram|streetcar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
| url = http://guitarvideos.com/interviews/davis/index.html
| title = Reverend Gary Davis Interview
| accessdate = 2006-08-04
| publisher = Stefan Grossman
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His complex and intricate finger picking has inspired [[Reverend Gary Davis]], [[Jorma Kaukonen]], [[Ry Cooder]], [[Ralph McTell]], [[Leon Redbone]] and many others. [[French people|French]] [[singer-songwriter]] [[Francis Cabrel]] refers to Blind Blake in the song &quot;Cent Ans de Plus&quot; on the 1999 [[album]] ''Hors-Saison.''

==Other people that used the same name==
On a few records where [[white people|white]] [[jazz]] guitarist [[Eddie Lang]] sat in with [[African American]] groups, the [[record label|record companies]] listed Lang as &quot;Blind Blake&quot;. Most of those recordings, principally with [[Lonnie Johnson]], gave Lang the name &quot;Blind Willy Dunn&quot;. 

There is also a different artist who recorded multiple LPs under the name &quot;Blind Blake&quot;. [[Blake Alphonso Higgs|Alphonso &quot;Blind Blake&quot; Higgs]] was one of the most popular singers in [[The Bahamas]] in the 1950s, leading the [[house band]] at the Royal Victoria Hotel. His records were spread all over the [[United States|U.S.]] by [[tourism|tourist]] [[Fan (aficionado)|fan]]s, and several of his songs became [[folk music|folk]] [[Jazz standard|standard]]s.

The Hon. '''Brian Charles Lara''', [[Trinity Cross|TC]], [[Order of the Caribbean Community|OCC]], [[Member of the Order of Australia|AM]] (born 2 May 1969, in [[Santa Cruz, Trinidad and Tobago|Santa Cruz]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]]) is a [[West Indies cricket team|West Indian]] international cricket player,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.cricinfo.com/westindies/content/player/52337.html|title=Player Profile: Brian Lara|work=CricInfo|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=2009-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/serialisations/article3694486.ece |title= Genius of Brian Lara hailed by Wisden |publisher= [[TimesOnline]] | location=London | date=7 April 2008 | accessdate=26 April 2010 | first=Mike | last=Atherton}}&lt;/ref&gt; widely regarded as one of the greatest batsmen of all time. He topped the [[Test cricket|Test]] batting [[LG ICC cricket ratings|rankings]] on several occasions and holds several cricketing records, including the record for the highest individual score in [[first-class cricket]], with 501 not out for [[Warwickshire County Cricket Club|Warwickshire]] against [[Durham County Cricket Club|Durham]] at [[Edgbaston Cricket Ground|Edgbaston]] in 1994, which is the only quintuple hundred in first-class cricket history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/cricket/article25899.ece |title= Farewell to legend Lara |work= [[The Sun (newspaper)|The Sun]] | location=London |first=Ali |last=Martin |date=9 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BBC radio commentary on the final day of the innings (6 June 1994), by [[Dave Roberts (Sports Broadcaster/Referee)|Dave Roberts]], was being broadcast around the world live via the BBC World Service network, and in the UK on BBC Radios 1, 2 &amp; 4 as well as the majority of BBC Local radio stations. That evening, as Lara neared the all-time batting record,a huge surge of fans crowded to enter the grounds.
Lara also holds the record for the highest individual score in a test innings after scoring 400 not out against [[England]] at [[Antigua]] in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://stats.cricinfo.com/ci/content/records/208504.html |title= Most runs in an innings |publisher= www.cricinfo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the only batsman to have ever scored a hundred, a double century, a triple century, a quadruple century and a quintuple century in first class games over the course of a senior career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://everything2.com/title/Brian%2520Lara |title= Record-breaking Batsman and Captain of the West Indies Test Cricket team}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.itscricket.com/lara.htm |title= West Indies Cricket Team}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lara also holds the test record of scoring most number of runs in a single over in a Test match, when he scored 28 runs off an over by [[Robin Peterson]] of [[South Africa]] in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://stats.cricinfo.com/ci/content/records/233006.html |title= Most runs off one over |publisher= www.cricinfo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lara's match-winning performance of 153 not out against Australia in [[Bridgetown]], [[Barbados]] in 1999 has been rated by [[Wisden]] as the second best batting performance in the history of Test cricket, next only to the 270 runs scored by [[Sir Donald Bradman]] in [[The Ashes]] Test match of 1937.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.thehindujobs.com/thehindu/2001/07/28/stories/07280281.htm |title= Wisden 100 hails Laxman, ignores Tendulkar |publisher= [[The Hindu]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Muttiah Muralitharan]], rated as the greatest [[Test cricket|Test match]] [[bowler (cricket)|bowler]] ever by ''[[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack]]'',&lt;ref name=bbc-12/13/02&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/cricket/2572069.stm |title=Murali 'best bowler ever' |publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|date=2002-12-13 |accessdate=2007-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the highest wicket-taker in both [[Test cricket]]&lt;ref name=testlist&gt;''Cricinfo'', [http://stats.cricinfo.com/ci/content/records/93276.html Highest Test Wicket-takers]&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[One Day Internationals]] (ODIs),&lt;ref name=odilist&gt;''Cricinfo'', [http://stats.cricinfo.com/ci/content/records/283193.html Highest ODI Wicket-takers]&lt;/ref&gt; has hailed Lara as his toughest opponent among all batsmen in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://in.rediff.com/wc2003/2003/feb/28muth.htm |title= Lara a tougher opponent than Tendulkar: Murali |publisher= www.in.rediff.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lara was awarded the [[Wisden Leading Cricketer in the World]] awards in 1994 and 1995&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisden_Leading_Cricketer_in_the_World |title= Wisden Leading Cricketer in the World}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is also one of only three cricketers to receive the prestigious [[BBC Overseas Sports Personality of the Year]], the other two being [[Sir Garfield Sobers]] and [[Shane Warne]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/tv_and_radio/sports_personality_of_the_year/7772192.stm |title= Sports Personality |publisher= BBC | date=14 December 2008 | accessdate=2 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brian Lara is popularly nicknamed as &quot;The Prince of Port of Spain&quot; or simply &quot;The Prince&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;cricpro&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.cricinfo.com/westindies/content/player/52337.html|title=Player Profile: Brian Lara|work=CricInfo|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=2009-06-07}}{{Failed verification|date=May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 November 2009 he was appointed honorary member of the [[Order of Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://in.news.yahoo.com/43/20091127/928/tsp-brian-lara-awarded-order-of-australi.html |title=Brian Lara awarded Order of Australia |date=27 November 2009 |work=Yahoo!

==Early life==
Lara was the 10th of 11 children. Lara's father Bunty and one of his older sisters Agnes Cyrus enrolled him in the local Harvard Coaching Clinic at the age of six for weekly coaching sessions on Sundays. As a result, Lara had a very early education in correct batting technique. Lara's first school was St. Joseph's Roman Catholic primary. He then went to San Juan secondary, which is located in Moreau Road, Lower santa Cruz. A year later, at fourteen years old, he moved on to [[Fatima College]] where he started his development as a promising young player under cricket coach Mr. Harry Ramdass. Aged 14, he amassed 745 runs in the schoolboys' league, with an average of 126.16 per innings, which earned him selection for the Trinidad national under-16 team. When he was 15 years old, he played in his first West Indian under 19 youth tournament and that same year, Lara represented West Indies in Under-19 cricket.

Lara moved in with his future fellow Trinidadian cricketer [[Michael Carew]] in Woodbrook, [[Port of Spain]] (a 20 minute drive from Santa Cruz). Michael's father [[Joey Carew]] worked with him on his cricketing and personal career development. Michael got Lara his first job at [[House of Angostura|Angostura Ltd.]] in the marketing department. Lara played in Trinidad and Tobago junior soccer and table tennis sides but Lara believed that cricket was his path to success, saying that he wanted to emulate his idols [[Gordon Greenidge]], [[Viv Richards]] and [[Roy Fredericks]].

==Early First-class career==
1987 was a breakthrough year for Lara, when in the West Indies Youth Championships he scored 498 runs breaking the record of 480 by [[Carl Hooper]] set the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nalis.gov.tt/Biography%5Cbio_BrianLara_captaincy.html ''The Coming Foretold''] [[The Independent]]. Retrieved 30 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; He captained the tournament winning Trinidad and Tobago, who profited from a match winning 116 from Lara.

In January 1988, Lara made his first-class debut for [[Trinidad and Tobago cricket team|Trinidad and Tobago]] in the [[Red Stripe Cup]] against [[Leeward Islands cricket team|Leeward Islands]]. In his second first-class match he made 92 against a Barbados attack containing [[Joel Garner]] and [[Malcolm Marshall]], two greats of West Indies teams. Later in the same year, he captained the West Indies team in Australia for the Bicentennial Youth World Cup where the West Indies reached the semi-finals. Later that year, his innings of 182 as captain of the West Indies under 23 XI against the touring Indian team further elevated his reputation.

His first selection for the full West Indies team followed in due course, but unfortunately coincided with the death of his father and Lara withdrew from the team. In 1989, he captained a West Indies B Team in Zimbabwe and scored 145.

In 1990, at the age of 20, Lara became Trinidad and Tobago's youngest ever captain, leading them that season to victory in the one-day Geddes Grant Shield. It was also in 1990 that he made his belated Test debut for West Indies against [[Pakistani cricket team|Pakistan]], scoring 44 and 5. He had made his ODI debut a month earlier against Pakistan, scoring 11. In the [[1992 Cricket World Cup|1992 World Cup]] Lara did well averaging 47.57 with a highest score of 88 retired hurt.

==International career==

[[File:BrianLaraUkexpat.jpg|thumb|400px|right|Brian Lara batting against [[Indian national cricket team|India]] at [[Kensington Oval]], [[Bridgetown]], [[Barbados]] in 2002.]]

In January 1993, Lara scored 277 versus Australia in Sydney. This, his maiden Test century in his fifth Test, was the turning point of the series as West Indies won the final two Tests to win the series 2–1.Lara went on to name his daughter Sydney after scoring 277 at SCG.

Lara holds several world records for high scoring. He has the highest individual score in both [[first-class cricket]] (501 [[not out]] for [[Warwickshire County Cricket Club|Warwickshire]] against [[Durham County Cricket Club|Durham]] in 1994) and Test cricket (400 not out for the West Indies against [[English cricket team|England]] in 2004). Lara amassed his world record 501 in 474 minutes off only 427 balls. He hit 308 in boundaries (10 sixes and 62 fours). His partners were [[Roger Twose]] (115 partnership – 2nd wicket), [[Trevor Penney]] (314 – 3rd), [[Paul Smith (cricketer)|Paul Smith]] (51 – 4th) and [[Keith John Piper|Keith Piper]] (322 unbroken – 5th). Earlier in that season Lara scored six centuries in seven innings while playing for Warwickshire.

He is the only man to have reclaimed the Test record score, having scored 375 against England in 1994, a record that stood until [[Matthew Hayden]]'s 380 against [[Zimbabwean cricket team|Zimbabwe]] in 2003. His 400 not out also made him the second player after [[Donald Bradman]] to score two Test triple-centuries, and the second after [[Bill Ponsford]] to score two first-class quadruple-centuries. He has scored nine double centuries in Test cricket, second only to Bradman's twelve. In 1995 Lara in the Test match away series against England, scored 3 hundreds in Three consecutive Matches which earned him the Man of the Series award. The Test Series was eventually drawn 2–2. He also held the record for the highest total number of runs in a Test career, after overtaking [[Allan Border]] in an innings of 226 played at [[Adelaide Oval]], Australia in November 2005. This would be later broken by [[Sachin Tendulkar]] of [[India]] on 17 October 2008 whilst playing against Australia at Mohali in the 2nd Test of the [[Border-Gavaskar Trophy]] 2008. 

Lara captained the West Indies from 1998 to 1999, when West Indies suffered their first whitewash at the hands of [[South Africa national cricket team|South Africa]]. Following this they played Australia in a four Test series which was drawn 2–2, with Lara scoring 546 runs including three centuries and one double hundred. In the second Test at Kingston he scored 213 while in the third Test he scored 153* in the second innings as West Indies chased down 311 with one wicket left. He won the Man of the Match award for both matches and was also named Man of the Series.

In 2001 Lara was named the Man of the Carlton Series in Australia with an average of 46.50, the highest average by a West Indian in that series, scoring two half centuries and one century, 116 against Australia. That same year Lara amassed 688 runs in the three match away Test series against Sri Lanka making three centuries, and one fifty – including the double century and a century in the first and second innings of the 3rd Test Match at the Sinhalese Sports Ground, equating to 42% of the team's runs in that series. These extraordinary performances led Muttiah Muralitharan to state that Lara was the most dangerous batsman he had ever faced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/srilanka/content/story/133274.html |title=Murali: 'Lara's still No. 1' |publisher=Content-uk.cricinfo.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lara was reappointed as captain against the touring [[Australian cricket team|Australians]] in 2003, and struck 110 in his first Test match back in charge, showing a return to stellar performance. Later that season, under his captaincy, West Indies won the two match Test series against Sri Lanka 1–0 with Lara making a double century in the First Test. In September 2004, West Indies won the ICC Champions Trophy in England under his captaincy.

In March 2005, Lara declined selection for the West Indies team because of a dispute over his personal [[Cable &amp; Wireless (Caribbean)|Cable &amp; Wireless]] sponsorship deal, which clashed with the Cricket Board's main sponsor, [[Digicel]]. Six other players were involved in this dispute, including stars [[Chris Gayle]], [[Ramnaresh Sarwan]] and [[Dwayne Bravo]]. Lara said he declined selection in a stand of solidarity, when these players were dropped because of their sponsorship deals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/westindies/content/story/146390.html |title='I'm ready to play if best team is selected' – Lara |publisher=Content-uk.cricinfo.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The issue was resolved after the first Test of the series against the touring [[South African cricket team|South African team]].

Lara returned to the team for the second Test (and scored a huge first innings score of 196), but in the process lost his captaincy indefinitely to the newly-appointed [[Shivnarine Chanderpaul]]. In the next Test, against the same opponents, he scored a 176 in the first innings. After a one day series against South Africa, he scored his first Test century against the visiting Pakistanis in the first Test at [[Kensington Oval]], [[Bridgetown]], [[Barbados]] which the West Indies eventually won.

On 26 April 2006 Lara was reappointed the captain of the West Indies cricket team for the third time. This followed the resignation of Shivnarine Chanderpaul, who had been captain for thirteen months – in which the West Indies won just one of the 14 Test matches they had competed. In May 2006, Lara led the West Indies to successful One-Day series victories against Zimbabwe and India. Lara's team played Australia in the finals of the DLF Cup and the ICC Champions Trophy where they finished runners up in both finals.

On 16 December 2006 he became the first player for the West Indies to pass 10,000 One Day International runs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.howstat.com/cricket/Statistics/Batting/BattingCareerRuns_ODI.asp?Stat=5000 |title= ODI Batting Statistics}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with [[Sachin Tendulkar]] one of only two players, at the time, to do so in both forms of the game. On 10 April 2007 Lara confirmed his retirement from one day cricket post the [[2007 Cricket World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/other_international/west_indies/6543709.stm ''Lara confirms one-day retirement''] [[BBC News]].

Retrieved 30 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lara played his final international game on 21 April 2007 in a [[dead rubber]] World Cup game against England. He was run out for 18 after a mix up with Marlon Samuels; England won the game by 1 run. Before the end of this World Cup Glenn McGrath stated that Lara is the greatest batsman that he has ever bowled to.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rediff.com/wc2007/2007/apr/28mcgrath.htm ''McGrath rates Lara just ahead of Tendulkar''].

==Retirement==
[[File:Brian Lara lap of honour.jpg|thumb|Lara during his lap of honour, 2007 CWC.]]
On 19 April 2007 Lara announced his retirement from all forms of international cricket, indicating that the West Indies vs England match on 21 April 2007 would be his last international appearance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/news/cricket/lara-turns-his-back-on-cricket/2007/04/20/1176697042541.html ''Lara turns his back on cricket''] retrieved on 29 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; He was run out after a bad mixup with [[Marlon Samuels]] for 18, as England went on to win the match by one wicket.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/6576083.stm ''West Indies v England''] [[BBC News]]. Retrieved 29 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

He announced before the 2007 Cricket World Cup that this would be his last appearance in One Day Internationals. After his last match, in the post-game presentation interview, he asked the fans, &quot;Did I entertain?&quot;, to which he received a resounding &quot;Yes!&quot; from the West Indies fans, after which he went out and took his 'lap of honor' where he met and shook hands with many of the fans. Lara stated this would be his last appearance in international cricket, he has also indicated his interest in retaining some involvement in the sport.

On 23 July 2007 Lara agreed to sign for the [[Indian Cricket League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/303309.html |title=Lara signs up for new Indian league |publisher=Content-uk.cricinfo.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is currently the captain of the [[Mumbai Champs]]. He volunteered to play for his home team Trinidad during the start of 2008 domestic season. He had not played for Trinidad for the last two years. He made his comeback a memorable one with a match winning hundred over Guyana, followed by a dismissive undefeated half-century in the second innings, scored at over two runs per ball. In the third round game (Trinidad got a bye in the second round).

Lara suffered a fractured arm against the Leeward Islands in St Maarten on January 19, which kept him out of the ICL season. He nevertheless affirmed his commitment to returning to Twenty20 cricket,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/mcc/content/story/464785.html|title=Brian Lara maintains Twenty20 comeback plans|date=29 June 2010|work=[[Cricinfo]]|accessdate=28 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on 27 June 2010 appeared for the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] match against a touring Pakistan team, scoring 37 from 32 balls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/england-v-pakistan-2010/engine/current/match/462605.html|title=Scorecard: Pakistan tour of England – tour match Marylebone Cricket Club v Pakistanis|work=CricInfo|accessdate=28 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Wisden 100]] rates Lara's 153 not out against Australia in Bridgetown in 1998–99 as the second best innings ever after Sir Donald Bradman's 270 against England in Melbourne in 1936–37.

Upon hearing Lara's decision to return to top class Cricket, former West Indies fast bowler [[Curtly Ambrose]] and wicket-keeper/batsman [[Jeff Dujon]] talking on the SportsMax Cricket Talk Show – From the Pitch, advised Lara to stay away from the IPL at this stage of Lara's life. Ambrose said &quot;If I was supposed to advise Brian, I would advise him to stay out. He hasn't played any form of competitive cricket for a few years. When you reach certain heights in international sports, you can really damage your reputation quite a bit if you can't reproduce that kind of standard. I don't think he should come back.&quot; Dujon also voiced similar comments  saying &quot;I wouldn't advise him to come back. He has had a wonderful career and he should live with those memories&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportingeagle.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=855:ambrose-dujon-against-laras-return-to-top-flight-cricket&amp;catid=36:newsheadlines&amp;Itemid=29|title=Ambrose, Dujon against Lara's return to top flight cricket |author=|publisher=SportingEagle.com|date=2010-12-30|accessdate=2010-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Despite having a base price of $400,000, Lara went unsold in the auction of IPL 4.

==Controversies==
On the fourth day of the first Test match at Antigua Recreation Ground, St John's, Antigua during India's tour of West Indies, 2006, [[Mahendra Singh Dhoni]]'s flick off [[Dave Mohammed]] to the midwicket region was caught by [[Daren Ganga]]. As the batsman started to walk back, captain [[Rahul Dravid]] declared the innings when confusion started as the umpires were not certain if the fielder stepped on the ropes and Dhoni stayed for the umpire's verdict. While the replays were inconclusive, the captain of the West Indies side, Brian Lara wanted Dhoni to walk-off based on the fielder's assertion of the catch. The impasse continued for more than 15 minutes. Ultimately, Dhoni walked-off and Dravid's declaration was effected but the game was delayed. Lara was called by the match referee for explanation of his actions but was not fined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/wivind/content/story/250387.html |title=Lara did not cross the line |publisher=Content-uk.cricinfo.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three innings by Lara were placed in the top 15 (the most for any batsman in that range).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rediff.com/cricket/2001/jul/30bat100.htm |publisher=rediff.com |work=Cricket channel |title=Top 100 Batsmen of all time}}&lt;/ref&gt; His 153 not out in [[Bridgetown, Barbados]], during West Indies' 2–2 home series draw against Australia in *1998–1999 was deemed the second greatest Test innings ever played, behind Bradman's 270 against England in the Third Test of the 1936–1937 series at [[Melbourne cricket ground|Melbourne]]. On 13 October 2003, PricewaterhouseCoopers Ratings team published a list of top innings since 1990 under their own methodology. Lara's 213 against Australia in [[Kingston, Jamaica]] in 1999 came out to be the top innings. His 375 was placed 8th and his three other innings, including the 153 not out, were not far behind.
* Lara holds the third fastest century in ODIs, 45 balls against Bangladesh in 1999.
* He is one of six batsmen to make a [[century (cricket)|century]] before lunch.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stats.cricinfo.com/ci/content/records/283003.html Cricinfo – Records – Test matches – Hundred runs before lunch]. Retrieved 2009-05-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Beagle'''  is a [[dog breed|breed]] of small to medium-sized [[dog]]. A member of the [[Hound Group]], it is similar in appearance to the [[Foxhound]] but smaller, with shorter legs and longer, softer ears. Beagles are [[scent hound]]s, developed primarily for [[Tracking (hunting)|tracking]] [[hare]], [[rabbit]], and other [[Game (food)|game]]. They have a keen sense of smell and tracking instinct that sees them employed as [[detection dog]]s for prohibited agricultural imports and foodstuffs in [[quarantine]] around the world. Beagles are intelligent, and are popular as pets because of their size, even temper, and lack of [[Dog health|inherited health problems]]. These characteristics also make them the dog of choice for [[animal testing]].

Although beagle-type dogs have existed for over 2,000 years, the modern breed was developed in [[Great Britain]] around the 1830s from several breeds, including the [[Talbot (dog)|Talbot Hound]], the [[North Country Beagle]], the [[Southern Hound]], and possibly the [[Harrier (dog)|Harrier]].

Beagles have been depicted in popular culture since [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan]] times in literature and paintings, and more recently in film, television and comic books. [[Snoopy]] of the [[comic strip]] ''[[Peanuts]]'' has been promoted as &quot;the world's most famous beagle&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;mostfamousbeagle&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snoopy.com/comics/peanuts/places_to_visit/snoopy_parks_and_museums.html|title=Places to Visit|year=2005|publisher=United Feature Syndicate, Inc.|accessdate=9 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Early beagle-type dogs===
Dogs of similar size and purpose to the modern Beagle{{Ref_label|A|a|none}} can be traced in [[Ancient Greece]]&lt;ref name=&quot;dNSW&quot;&gt;
   &quot;The Beagle Club of NSW (Australia)&quot;, BeagleClubnsw.org.au,
   April 2009, web:
   [http://www.beagleclubnsw.org.au/breedinf.htm BC-NSW-inf].
&lt;/ref&gt;
back to around the 5th century BC. [[Xenophon]], born around 433 BC, in his ''Treatise on Hunting'' or ''Cynegeticus'' refers to a [[hound]] that hunted hares by scent and was followed on foot.  Small hounds are mentioned in the Forest Laws of [[Canute the Great|Canute]] which exempted them from the ordinance which commanded that all dogs capable of running down a [[Deer|stag]] should have one foot mutilated.&lt;ref&gt;Daglish p.7&lt;/ref&gt; If genuine, these laws would confirm that beagle-type dogs were present in England before 1016, but it is likely the laws were written in the [[Middle Ages]] to give a sense of antiquity and tradition to Forest Law.&lt;ref&gt;Rackham p.130&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Image:Southern Hound.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Southern Hound]] is thought to be an ancestor of the Beagle]]
In the 11th century, [[William I of England|William the Conqueror]] brought the [[Talbot (dog)|Talbot hound]] to Britain. The Talbot was a predominantly white, slow, deep-throated, scent hound derived from the [[St. Hubert Hound]] which had been developed in the 8th century. At some point the English Talbots were crossed with [[Greyhound]]s to give them an extra turn of speed.&lt;ref&gt;Smith p.209&lt;/ref&gt; Long extinct, the Talbot strain probably gave rise to the Southern Hound which, in turn, is thought to be an ancestor of the modern day Beagle.{{Ref_label|B|b|none}}

From medieval times, ''beagle'' was used as a generic description for the smaller hounds, though these dogs differed considerably from the modern breed. Miniature breeds of beagle-type dogs were known from the times of [[Edward II of England|Edward II]] and [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]], who both had packs of Glove Beagles, so named since they were small enough to fit on a glove, and [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]] kept a breed known as a Pocket Beagle, which stood {{convert|8|to|9|in|cm|abbr=off}} at the shoulder. Small enough to fit in a &quot;pocket&quot; or saddlebag, they rode along on the hunt. The larger hounds would run the prey to ground, then the hunters would release the small dogs to continue the chase through underbrush. Elizabeth I referred to the dogs as her ''singing beagles'' and often entertained guests at her royal table by letting her Pocket Beagles cavort amid their plates and cups.&lt;ref name=&quot;J1858&quot;&gt;Jesse (1858) pp.438–9&lt;/ref&gt; 19th-century sources refer to these breeds interchangeably and it is possible that the two names refer to the same small variety. In George Jesse's ''Researches into the History of the British Dog'' from 1866, the early 17th century poet and writer [[Gervase Markham]] is quoted referring to the Beagle as small enough to sit on a man's hand and to the:
{{bquote|little small mitten-beagle, which may be companion for a ladies kirtle, and in the field will run as cunningly as any hound whatere, only their musick is very small like reeds.&lt;ref&gt;G. Jesse vol II, pp.223-232&lt;/ref&gt;}} Standards for the Pocket Beagle were drawn up as late as 1901; these genetic lines are now extinct, although modern breeders have attempted to recreate the variety.&lt;ref name=&quot;PB&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://clubs.akc.org/NBC/NBC_FAQs.html#24.|title=What is a Pocket Beagle?|publisher=American Kennel Club|accessdate=9 July 2007| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070609070137/http://clubs.akc.org/NBC/NBC_FAQs.html| archivedate = June 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eighteenth century===
[[Image:Beagle ancient.jpg|thumb|right|This image from the turn of the 19th century shows a dog with a heavier body and lacking the refined features of later strains.]]
By the 18th century two breeds had been developed for hunting hare and rabbit: the [[Southern Hound]] and the [[North Country Beagle]] (or Northern Hound). The Southern Hound, a tall, heavy dog with a square head, and long, soft ears, was common from south of the [[River Trent]] and probably closely related to the [[Talbot (dog)|Talbot Hound]]. Though slow, it had stamina and an excellent scenting ability. The North Country Beagle, possibly a cross between an offshoot of the Talbot stock and a Greyhound, was bred chiefly in [[Yorkshire]] and was common in the northern counties. It was smaller than the Southern Hound, less heavy-set and with a more pointed muzzle. It was faster than its southern counterpart but its scenting abilities were less well developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The New Sporting Magazine|publisher=Baldwin and Craddock|year=1833|volume=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; As fox hunting became increasingly popular, numbers of both types of hound diminished. The beagle-type dogs were crossed with larger breeds such as Stag Hounds to produce the modern [[English Foxhound|Foxhound]]. The beagle-size varieties came close to extinction but some farmers in the South ensured the survival of the prototype breeds by maintaining small [[rabbit-hunting]] packs.

===Development of the modern breed===
Reverend Phillip Honeywood established a Beagle pack in [[Essex]] in the 1830s and it is believed that this pack formed the basis for the modern Beagle breed.
Although details of the pack's lineage are not recorded it is thought that North Country Beagles and Southern Hounds were strongly represented; William Youatt suspected that [[Harrier (dog)|Harriers]] formed a good majority of the Beagle's bloodline, but the origin of the Harrier is itself obscure.&lt;ref name=&quot;Y110&quot;&gt;Youatt. p.110&lt;/ref&gt; Honeywood's Beagles were small, standing at about {{convert|10|in|cm|abbr=off|lk=off}} at the shoulder, and pure white according to John Mills (writing in ''The Sportsman's Library'' in 1845). [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]] and [[Edward Turnour, 4th Earl Winterton|Lord Winterton]] also had Beagle packs around this time, and royal favour no doubt led to some revival of interest in the breed, but Honeywood's pack was regarded as the finest of the three.&lt;ref&gt;Mills p.172&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:4-beagles.jpg|thumb|right|Early images of the Beagle (clockwise from top left): 1833, 1835, Stonehenge's Medium (1859, reusing Youtt's 1852 &quot;Beagle&quot; image) and Dwarf Beagle (1859).]]
Although credited with the development of the modern breed, Honeywood concentrated on producing dogs for hunting and it was left to Thomas Johnson to refine the breeding to produce dogs that were both attractive and capable hunters. Two strains were developed: the rough- and smooth-coated varieties. The rough-coated Beagle survived until the beginning of the 20th century, and there were even records of one making an appearance at a dog show as late as 1969, but this variety is now extinct, having probably been absorbed into the standard Beagle bloodline.&lt;ref name=&quot;K7&quot;&gt;Kraeuter p.7&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1840s, a standard Beagle type was beginning to develop: the distinction between the North Country Beagle and Southern Hound had been lost, but there was still a large variation in size, character, and reliability among the emerging packs.&lt;ref&gt;Scott pp.75–8&lt;/ref&gt; In 1856, &quot;Stonehenge&quot; (the pseudonym of John Henry Walsh, editor of ''[[The Field (magazine)|The Field]]''), writing in the ''Manual of British Rural Sports'' was still dividing Beagles into four varieties: the medium Beagle; the dwarf or lapdog Beagle; the fox Beagle (a smaller, slower version of the Foxhound); and the rough-coated or terrier Beagle, which he classified as a cross between any of the other varieties and one of the Scottish [[terrier]] breeds.&lt;ref name=&quot;S98&quot;&gt;Stonehenge pp.98–9&lt;/ref&gt; Stonehenge also gives the start of a standard description:

{{bquote|In size the beagle measures from 10 inches, or even less, to 15. In shape they resemble the old southern hound in miniature, but with more neatness and beauty; and they also resemble that hound in style of hunting.&lt;ref name=&quot;S98&quot; /&gt;}}

By 1887 the threat of extinction was on the wane: there were 18 Beagle packs in England.&lt;ref name=&quot;K9&quot;&gt;Krauter p.9&lt;/ref&gt; The Beagle Club was formed in 1890 and the first standard drawn up at the same time.&lt;ref name=&quot;A12&quot;&gt;Arnold p.12&lt;/ref&gt; The following year the Association of Masters of Harriers and Beagles was formed. Both organisations aimed to further the best interests of the breed, and both were keen to produce a standard type of Beagle.&lt;ref&gt;Daglish p.9&lt;/ref&gt; By 1902 the number of packs had risen to 44.&lt;ref name=&quot;K9&quot; /&gt;

===Export===
Beagles were in the United States by the 1840s at the latest, but the first dogs were imported strictly for hunting and were of variable quality. Since Honeywood had only started breeding in the 1830s, it is unlikely these dogs were representative of the modern breed and the description of them as looking like straight-legged [[Dachshund]]s with weak heads has little resemblance to the standard. Serious attempts at establishing a quality bloodline began in the early 1870s when General [[Richard Rowett]] from [[Illinois]] imported some dogs from England and began breeding. Rowett's Beagles are believed to have formed the models for the first American standard, drawn up by Rowett, L. H. Twadell, and Norman Ellmore in 1887.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold p.14&lt;/ref&gt; The Beagle was accepted as a breed by the [[American Kennel Club]] (AKC) in 1884. In the 20th century the breed has spread worldwide.

===Popularity===
[[Image:Beagle Upsy.jpg|thumb|right|An attractive uniform type for the breed developed at the start of the 20th century]] 

On its formation, the Association of Masters of Harriers and Beagles took over the running of a regular show at [[Peterborough]] that had started in 1889, and the Beagle Club in the UK held its first show in 1896.&lt;ref name=&quot;A12&quot; /&gt; The regular showing of the breed led to the development of a uniform type, and the Beagle continued to prove a success up until the outbreak of [[World War I]] when all shows were suspended. After the war, the breed was again struggling for survival in the UK: the last of the Pocket Beagles was probably lost during this time, and registrations fell to an all-time low. A few breeders (notably Reynalton Kennels) managed to revive interest in the dog and by [[World War II]], the breed was once again doing well. Registrations dropped again after the end of the war but almost immediately recovered.&lt;ref&gt;Daglish pp.10–12&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1959 Derawunda Vixen won &quot;Best in Show&quot; at [[Crufts]].&lt;ref name=&quot;A12&quot; /&gt;

As purebred dogs, Beagles have always been more popular in the United States and Canada than in their native country. The National Beagle Club of America was formed in 1888 and by 1901 a Beagle had won a Best in Show title. As in the UK, activity during World War I was minimal, but the breed showed a much stronger revival in the U.S. when hostilities ceased. In 1928 it won a number of prizes at the [[Westminster Kennel Club]]'s show and by 1939 a Beagle &amp;ndash; Champion Meadowlark Draughtsman &amp;ndash; had captured the title of top-winning American-bred dog for the year.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold pp.14–5&lt;/ref&gt;  On 12 February 2008, a Beagle, [[K-Run's Park Me In First|K-Run's Park Me In First (Uno)]], won the Best In Show category at the Westminster Kennel Club show for the first time in the competition's history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601088&amp;sid=aS4PHV8NjOW8|title=Beagle Breakthrough: Westminster Crowd Favorite Uno Is Top Dog |publisher=Bloomberg|date=2008-02-12|accessdate=13 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In North America they have been consistently in the top-ten most-popular breeds for over 30 years. From 1953 to 1959 the Beagle was ranked No. 1 on the list of the [[American Kennel Club]]'s registered breeds;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.akc.org/pdfs/press_center/popular_pooches.pdf|format=PDF|title=AKC Registration Statistics|publisher=American Kennel Club|year=2006|accessdate=11 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2005 and 2006 it ranked 5th out of the 155 breeds registered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.akc.org/reg/dogreg_stats.cfm|title=AKC Breed Registration Statistics|publisher=American Kennel Club|year=2006|accessdate=11 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK they are not quite so popular, placing 28th and 30th in the rankings of registrations with the Kennel Club in 2005 and 2006 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/cgi-bin/item.cgi?id=926&amp;d=pg_dtl_art_news&amp;h=242&amp;f=0|title=Registration statistics for all recognised dog breeds - 2005 and 2006|publisher=The Kennel Club|accessdate=9 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Name===
According to the [[Oxford English Dictionary]], the first mention of the beagle by name in English literature dates from ca. 1475 in the ''Esquire of Low Degree''. The origin of the word &quot;beagle&quot; is uncertain, although it has been suggested that the word derives from the [[French language|French]] ''begueule'' (meaning &quot;open throat&quot; from ''bayer'' &quot;open wide&quot; and ''gueule'' &quot;mouth&quot;)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=beagle&amp;searchmode=none|title=Beagle|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary|date=|accessdate=9 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; or from an [[Old English language|Old English]], French, or the [[Goidelic languages|Gaelic]] word ''beag'', meaning &quot;little.&quot; Other possibilities include the French ''beugler'' (meaning &quot;to bellow&quot;) and the [[German language|German]] ''begele'' (meaning &quot;to scold&quot;).

It is not known why the black and tan [[Kerry Beagle]], present in [[Ireland]] since [[Celt]]ic times, has the ''beagle'' description, since at {{convert|22|to|24|in|cm|abbr=off}} it is significantly taller than the modern day Beagle, and in earlier times was even larger. Some writers suggest that the Beagle's scenting ability may have come from cross-breeding earlier strains with the Kerry Beagle. Originally used for hunting stags, it is today used for hare and [[drag hunting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebreedsofdogs.com/KERRY_BEAGLE.htm|title=Kerry Beagle|publisher=Breeds of Dog|date=|accessdate=9 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
===Appearance===
[[Image:Beagle portrait Camry.jpg|thumb|left|The Kennel Club (UK) standard states the Beagle should give the impression of quality without coarseness.]]
The general appearance of the Beagle resembles a [[Foxhound]] in miniature, but the head is broader and the muzzle shorter, the expression completely different and the legs shorter in proportion to the body.&lt;ref&gt;Daglish p.37&lt;/ref&gt;  They are generally between {{convert|13|and|16|in|cm|abbr=off}} high at the [[withers]] and weigh between {{convert|18|and|35|lb|kg|abbr=on}}, with females being slightly smaller than males on average.&lt;ref&gt;Rice p.147&lt;/ref&gt;

They have a smooth, somewhat domed [[skull]] with a medium-length, square-cut [[snout|muzzle]] and a black (or occasionally liver), gumdrop nose. The jaw is strong and the teeth scissor together with the upper teeth fitting perfectly over the lower teeth and both sets aligned square to the jaw. The eyes are large, hazel or brown, with a mild hound-like pleading look. The large ears are long, soft and low-set, turning towards the cheeks slightly and rounded at the tips. Beagles have a strong, medium-length neck (which is long enough for them to easily bend to the ground to pick up a scent), with little folding in the skin but some evidence of a [[dewlap]]; a broad chest narrowing to a tapered [[abdomen]] and [[waist]] and a short, slightly curved tail (known as the &quot;stern&quot;) tipped with white. The white tip, known as the &quot;flag&quot; has been selectively bred for, as it allows the dog to be easily seen when its head is down following a scent.&lt;ref name=&quot;QLD&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.members.optusnet.com.au/~culorgair/beagleclubqld/booklet.pdf|format=PDF|title=What you need to know about Beagles|publisher=The Beagle Club of Queensland|accessdate=9 July 2007| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070710215221/http://www.members.optusnet.com.au/~culorgair/beagleclubqld/booklet.pdf| archivedate = July 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tail does not curl over the back, but is held upright when the dog is active. The Beagle has a muscular body and a medium-length, smooth, hard coat. The front legs are straight and carried under the body while the rear legs are muscular and well bent at the [[Stifle joint|stifles]].&lt;ref&gt;See various breed standards linked from the breed box at the top of the article.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coloring===
[[Image:Baegle dwa.jpg|thumb|right|A pair of Polish show Beagles showing a faded tricolour]]
Beagles appear in a range of colors. Although the tricolour (white with large black areas and light brown shading) is the most common, Beagles can occur in any hound colour.

Tricoloured dogs occur in a number of shades, from the &quot;Classic Tri&quot; with a jet black saddle (also known as &quot;Blackback&quot;), to the &quot;Dark Tri&quot; (where faint brown markings are intermingled with more prominent black markings), to the &quot;Faded Tri&quot; (where faint black markings are intermingled with more prominent brown markings). Some tricoloured dogs have a broken pattern, sometimes referred to as ''pied''. These dogs have mostly white coats with patches of black and brown hair. Tricolour Beagles are almost always born black and white. The white areas are typically set by eight weeks, but the black areas may fade to brown as the puppy matures.  (The brown may take between one and two years to fully develop.) Some Beagles gradually change colour during their lives, and may lose their black markings entirely.

Two-color varieties always have a white base color with areas of the second color. Tan and white is the most common two-color variety, but there is a wide range of other colors including lemon, a very light tan; red, a reddish, almost orange, brown; and liver, a darker brown, and black. Liver is not common and is not permitted in some standards; it tends to occur with yellow eyes. Ticked or mottled varieties may be either white or black with different colored flecks (''ticking''), such as the blue-mottled or bluetick Beagle, which has spots that appear to be a midnight-blue color, similar to the coloring of the [[Bluetick Coonhound]]. Some tricolour Beagles also have ticking of various colors in their white areas.&lt;ref&gt;Daglish p.44&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://clubs.akc.org/NBC/beagle_colors.htm|title=Beagle Colors|publisher=American Kennel Club|accessdate=9 July 2007| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070629065433/http://clubs.akc.org/NBC/beagle_colors.htm| archivedate = June 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sense of smell===
Alongside the [[Bloodhound]], the Beagle has one of the best developed senses of smell of any dog.&lt;ref name=&quot;F40&quot;&gt;Fogle p.40&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1950s, John Paul Scott and John Fuller began a 13 year study into canine behaviour. As part of this research, they tested the scenting abilities of various breeds by putting a mouse in a {{convert|1|acre|m2|adj=on}} field and timing how long it took the dogs to find it. The Beagles found it in less than a minute, while [[Fox Terrier]]s took 15 minutes and [[Scottish Terrier]]s failed to find it at all. Beagles are better at ground-scenting (following a trail on the ground) than they are at air-scenting, and for this reason they have been excluded from most [[mountain rescue]] teams in favour of [[collie]]s, which use sight in addition to air-scenting and are more biddable.&lt;ref name=&quot;F40&quot; /&gt; The long ears and large lips of the Beagle probably assist in trapping the scents close to the nose.&lt;ref&gt;Fogle p.173&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variations==
===Breed varieties===
The [[American Kennel Club]] recognizes two separate varieties of Beagle: the 13-inch for hounds less than {{convert|13|in|cm}}, and the 15-inch for those between {{convert|13|and|15|in|cm|abbr=off}}. The [[Canadian Kennel Club]] recognizes a single type, with a height not exceeding {{convert|15|in|cm|abbr=off}}.  The [[Kennel Club (UK)]] and [[Fédération Cynologique Internationale|FCI]] affiliated clubs recognize a single type, with a height of between {{convert|13|and|16|in|cm|abbr=off}}.

[[Image:BraxtonPuggle-edit1.jpg|thumb|right|A Puggle, a Beagle/Pug cross, shows traits from both breeds.]]
English and American varieties are sometimes mentioned. However, there is no official recognition from any Kennel Club for this distinction. Beagles fitting the American Kennel Club standard &amp;ndash; which disallows animals over {{convert|15|in|cm}} &amp;ndash; are smaller on average than those fitting the Kennel Club standard which allows heights up to {{convert|16|in|cm}}.

Pocket Beagles are sometimes advertised for sale but the bloodline for this variety is extinct, and, although the UK Kennel Club originally specified a standard for the Pocket Beagle in 1901, the variety is not now recognised by any Kennel Club. Often, small Beagles are the result of poor breeding or dwarfism.&lt;ref name=&quot;PB&quot; /&gt;

A strain known as Patch Hounds was developed by Willet Randall and his family from 1896 specifically for their rabbit hunting ability. They trace their bloodline back to Field Champion Patch, but do not necessarily have a patchwork marking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Patch Hounds|first=Willet|last=Randall|year=1967|page=9|url=http://www.baldeaglebeagles.com/flash/ss04.html|format=Flash}} Retrieved on 12 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crossbreeds===
In the 1850s, Stonehenge recommended a cross between a Beagle and a [[Scottish Terrier]] as a retriever. He found the [[crossbreed]] to be a good worker, silent and obedient, but it had the drawback that it was small and could barely carry a hare.&lt;ref&gt;Stonehenge p.46&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently the trend has been for &quot;designer dogs&quot; and one of the most popular has been the Beagle/[[Pug]] cross known as a [[Puggle (dog)|Puggle]]. Less excitable than a Beagle and with a lower exercise requirement, these dogs are suited to city dwelling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,174475,00.html|title=Designer Dogs: Meet the Puggle|author=Raakhee Mirchandani|publisher=Fox News|date=4 November 2005|accessdate=9 July 2007}}&lt;br /&gt;* {{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/05/21/sunday/main1638400.shtml|title=Designing A Cuter Dog|publisher=CBS|date=6 August 2006|accessdate=9 July 2007}}&lt;br /&gt;*

Another crossbreed of a beagle is &quot;'''Jack-a-Bee'''&quot;. A combination of [[Jack Russel Terrier]] with Beagle.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.designermixes.org/Breed_Info/62/Jack-A-Bee.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Labbe''', or '''Beagador''', crosses a Beagle with the [[Labrador Retriever]].  The cross arose from naturally occurring crosses adopted from shelters.  The Labbe (pronounced Lab ee)is an energetic dog that normally features the Labrador parent's solid color (Chocolate, Black, Fawn, which tends to be darker than a Labrador) with white on the toes, chest and occasionally the chin.  The dog grows to about the same size as a large beagle and tops out at between 30 and 40 pounds.  The advantage is much of the looks and skill of a Labrador Retriever in a more compact dog that is resistant to some of the Labrador's genetic problems, and not as prone to shed. However, Labbes often inherit the Beagle's famous bark and a healthy dose of stubbornness.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/labbe.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Temperament==
[[Image:BeagleNiniJule.jpg|thumb|left|Beagles are happy to rest without being exercised to exhaustion.]]
The Beagle has an even temper and gentle disposition. Described in several breed standards as &quot;merry&quot;, they are amiable and generally neither aggressive nor timid. They enjoy company, and although they may initially be standoffish with strangers, they are easily won over. They make poor [[guard dogs]] for this reason, although their tendency to bark or howl when confronted with the unfamiliar makes them good watch dogs. In a 1985 study conducted by Ben and Lynette Hart, the Beagle was given the highest excitability rating, along with the [[Yorkshire Terrier]], [[Cairn Terrier]], [[Miniature Schnauzer]], [[West Highland White Terrier]] and [[Fox Terrier]].&lt;ref&gt;Fogle pp.176–7&lt;/ref&gt;{{Ref_label|C|c|none}} 

Beagles are intelligent, but as a result of being bred for the long chase are single-minded and determined, which can make them hard to train. They are generally obedient but can be difficult to recall once they have picked up a scent and are easily distracted by smells around them. They do not generally feature in obedience trials; while they are alert, respond well to food-reward training, and are eager to please, they are easily bored or distracted. They are ranked 72nd in [[Stanley Coren]]'s ''[[The Intelligence of Dogs]]'', as Coren places them among the group with the lowest degree of working/obedience intelligence. Coren's scale, however, does not assess understanding, independence or creativity.

Beagles are excellent with children and this is one of the reasons they have become popular family pets, but they are pack animals, and can be prone to [[separation anxiety in dogs|separation anxiety]].&lt;ref&gt;Kraeuter pp.77–8&lt;/ref&gt; Not all Beagles will howl, but most will bark when confronted with strange situations, and some will bay (also referred to as &quot;speaking&quot;, &quot;giving tongue&quot;, or &quot;opening&quot;) when they catch the scent of potential quarry.&lt;ref&gt;Kraeuter pp.96&lt;/ref&gt; They also generally get along well with other dogs. They are not demanding with regard to exercise; their inbred stamina means they do not easily tire when exercised, but they also do not need to be worked to exhaustion before they will rest, though regular exercise helps ward off the weight gain to which the breed is prone.&lt;ref&gt;Daglish p.55&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health==
[[Image:Beagles Puppies.png|right|thumbnail|Day-old Beagle puppies]]

Beagles may be prone to [[epilepsy]], but this can be controlled with medication. [[Hypothyroidism]] and a number of types of [[dwarfism]] occur in Beagles. Two conditions in particular are unique to the breed: Funny Puppy, in which the puppy is slow to develop and eventually develops weak legs, a crooked back and although normally healthy, is prone to a range of illnesses;&lt;ref name=&quot;Probs&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://clubs.akc.org/NBC/beagle_health_problems.htm|title=Beagle Health Problems|publisher=American Kennel Club|accessdate=9 July 2007| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070611181229/http://clubs.akc.org/NBC/beagle_health_problems.htm| archivedate = June 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Hip dysplasia (canine)|Hip dysplasia]], common in Harriers and in some larger breeds, is rarely considered a problem in Beagles.&lt;ref&gt;Rice p.161&lt;/ref&gt; Beagles are considered a chondrodystrophic breed, meaning that they are prone to types of disk diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spinejournal.com/pt/re/spine/abstract.00007632-200605010-00005.htm;jsessionid=L2pTpfpWkgBFWsmLcwG6hQ6Qv3pwkvpgnK2Gxpz06bnGwSgLNBmH!-815685239!181195629!8091!-1 |title=Spine - Abstract: Volume 31(10) May 1, 2006 p 1094-1099 Notochord Cells Regulate Intervertebral Disc Chondrocyte Proteoglycan Production and Cell Proliferation |publisher=Spinejournal.com |date= |accessdate=2008-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Beagle 745.jpg|thumb|Weight gain can be a problem in older or sedentary dogs, which in turn can lead to heart and joint problems.]]
In rare cases, Beagles may develop [[immune mediated polygenic arthritis]] (where the immune system attacks the joints) even at a young age. The symptoms can sometimes be relieved by [[Corticosteroid#Uses|steroid]] treatments.&lt;ref name=&quot;Probs&quot; /&gt;

Their long floppy ears can mean that the inner ear does not receive a substantial air flow or that moist air becomes trapped, and this can lead to ear infections. Beagles may also be affected by a range of eye problems; two common ophthalmic conditions in Beagles are [[glaucoma]] and [[corneal dystrophy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gelatt, Kirk N. (ed.)|title=Veterinary Ophthalmology|edition=3rd|publisher=Lippincott, Williams &amp; Wilkins|year=1999|pages=656, 718|isbn=0-683-30076-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;[[Cherry eye]]&quot;, a prolapse of the gland of the [[third eyelid]], and [[distichiasis]], a condition in which eyelashes grow into the eye causing irritation, sometimes exist; both these conditions can be corrected with surgery.&lt;ref name=&quot;Probs&quot; /&gt; They can suffer from several types of [[retinal atrophy]]. Failure of the nasolacrimal drainage system can cause dry eye or leakage of tears onto the face.&lt;ref name=&quot;Probs&quot; /&gt;

As field dogs they are prone to minor injuries such as cuts and sprains, and, if inactive, obesity is a common problem as they will eat whenever food is available and rely on their owners to regulate their weight.&lt;ref name=&quot;Probs&quot; /&gt; When working or running free they are also likely to pick up parasites such as [[flea]]s, [[tick]]s, [[harvest mite]]s and [[tapeworm]]s, and irritants such as grass seeds can become trapped in their eyes, soft ears or paws.&lt;ref&gt;Rice pp.167–74&lt;/ref&gt;

Beagles may exhibit a behaviour known as [[reverse sneezing]], in which they sound as if they are choking or gasping for breath, but are actually drawing air in through the mouth and nose. The exact cause of this behaviour is not known, but it is not harmful to the dog.

==Working life==
===Hunting===
[[Image:Caynsham-beagles.jpg|thumb|right|The Caynsham Foot Beagles (c.1885)]]
Beagles were developed primarily for [[hunting]] hare, an activity known as [[beagling]]. They were seen as ideal hunting companions for the elderly who could follow on horseback without exerting themselves, for young hunters who could keep up with them on ponies, and for the poorer hunters who could not afford to maintain a stable of good hunting horses.&lt;ref&gt;Maxwell p.42&lt;/ref&gt; Before the advent of the fashion for foxhunting in the 19th century, hunting was an all day event where the enjoyment was derived from the chase rather than the kill. In this setting the tiny Beagle was well matched to the hare, as unlike Harriers they would not quickly finish the hunt, but because of their excellent scent-tracking skills and stamina they were almost guaranteed to eventually catch the hare. The Beagle packs would run closely together (&quot;so close that they might be covered with a sheet&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Y110&quot; /&gt;) which was useful in a long hunt, as it prevented stray dogs from obscuring the trail. In thick undergrowth they were also preferred to [[spaniel]]s when hunting [[pheasant]].&lt;ref&gt;Blakey p.77&lt;/ref&gt;

With the fashion for faster hunts, the Beagle fell out of favour for chasing hare, but was still employed for rabbit hunting. In ''Anecdotes of Dogs'', Jesse says:
{{bquote|In rabbit-shooting, in gorse and thick cover, nothing can be more cheerful than the beagle; and they have been called rabbit-beagles from this employment, for which they are peculiarly qualified, especially those dogs which are somewhat wire-haired.&lt;ref name=&quot;J1858&quot; /&gt;}}[[Image:Moritz v d Tomburg.jpg|thumb|left|The Beagle has been used for rabbit-hunting since the earliest development of the breed.]]
In the United States they appear to have been employed chiefly for hunting rabbits from the earliest imports.
Hunting hare with Beagles became popular again in Britain in the mid-19th century and continued until it was made illegal in Scotland by the [[Protection of Wild Mammals (Scotland) Act 2002]] and in England and Wales by the [[Hunting Act 2004]]. Under this legislation Beagles may still pursue rabbits with the [[landowner|landowner's]] permission. [[Drag hunting]] is popular where hunting is no longer permitted or for those owners who do not wish to participate in blood sports but still wish to exercise their dog's innate skills.

The traditional foot pack consists of up to 70 Beagles, marshalled by a Huntsman who directs the pack and who is assisted by a variable number of whippers-in whose job is to return straying hounds to the pack. The Master of the Hunt is in overall day-to-day charge of the pack, and may or may not take on the role of Huntsman on the day of the hunt. Beagles may also be employed individually or in a brace (a pair).&lt;ref name=&quot;K101&quot;&gt;Kraeuter pp.97–104&lt;/ref&gt;

As hunting with Beagles was seen as ideal for young people, many of the British [[Independent school (UK)|public schools]] traditionally maintained Beagle packs. Protests were lodged against [[Eton College|Eton's]] use of Beagles for hunting as early as 1902 but the pack is still in existence today,&lt;ref&gt;Hendrick pp.68–71&lt;/ref&gt; and a pack used by [[Wye College|Imperial College]] in [[Wye, Kent|Wye]], [[Kent]] was stolen by the [[Animal Liberation Front]] in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1103181.stm|title=Activists steal beagle pack|publisher=BBC News|date=5 January 2001|accessdate=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; School and university packs are still maintained by Eton, [[Marlborough College|Marlborough]], Wye, [[Radley College|Radley]], the [[Royal Agricultural College]] and [[Christ Church, Oxford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.horseandhound.co.uk/best/article.php?aid=71052&amp;cid=396|title=Directory of UK hunts 2006/2007|publisher=Horse and Hound|date=20 November 2006|accessdate=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beagles have been used for hunting a wide range of game including [[Snowshoe Hare]], [[Cottontail rabbit]]s, [[game bird]]s, [[Roe Deer]], [[Red Deer]], [[Bobcat]], [[Coyote]], [[Wild Boar]] and [[fox]]es, and have even been recorded as being used to hunt [[Stoat]].&lt;ref name=&quot;K101&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defra.gov.uk/rural/hunting/inquiry/evidence/mammalsoc.htm|title=Submission to Lord Burns' Committee of Inquiry into Hunting with Dogs|publisher=The Mammal Society|date=16 March 2000|accessdate=9 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most of these cases, the Beagle is employed as a gun dog, flushing game for hunter's guns.&lt;ref name=&quot;K101&quot; /&gt;

===Quarantine===
[[Image:CBP Airport .jpg|thumb|Beagles have excellent noses; this dog is employed by the US Customs and Border Protection Agency.]]
Beagles are used as detection dogs in the [[Beagle Brigade]] of the [[United States Department of Agriculture]]. These dogs are used to detect food items in luggage being taken into the United States. After trialling several breeds, Beagles were chosen because they are relatively small and unintimidating for people who are uncomfortable around dogs, easy to care for, intelligent and work well for rewards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aphis.usda.gov/lpa/pubs/detdog2.html|title=USDA's Detector Dogs: Protecting American Agriculture: Why Beagles?|publisher=United States Department of Agriculture: Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service|accessdate=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are also used for this purpose in a number of other countries including by the [[Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (New Zealand)|Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry]] in [[New Zealand]], the [[Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service]], and in [[Canada]], [[Japan]] and the [[People's Republic of China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.people.com.cn/200512/06/eng20051206_226039.html|title=A beagle honored as a defender at national gate|publisher=People's Daily Online|date=6 December 2006|accessdate=9 July 2007}}&lt;br /&gt;* {{cite web|url=http://www.daff.gov.au/about/media-centre/aqis-releases/2000/old_dogs_-_new_tricks_original_quarantine_k9s_on_the_scent_of_retirement|title=Old dogs&amp;nbsp;— new tricks Original quarantine K9's on the scent of retirement|publisher=Australian Government: Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry|date=30 November 2000|accessdate=9 July 2007}}&lt;br /&gt;* {{cite web|url=http://www.daff.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0009/111969/nairn_report.pdf|format=PDF|title=Australian Quarantine a shared responsibility|author=M.E.

===Testing===
Beagles are the dog breed most often used in [[animal testing]], due to their size and passive nature. Of the 8,018 dogs used in testing in the UK in 2004, 7,799 were Beagles (97.3%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.official-documents.gov.uk/document/cm67/6713/6713.pdf|format=PDF|title=Statistics of Scientific Procedures on Living Animals Great Britain 2004|year=2004|publisher=Home Office|accessdate=9 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK, the [[Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986]] gave special status to primates, equids, cats and dogs and in 2005 the Animal Procedures Committee (set up by the act) ruled that testing on mice was preferable, even though a greater number of individual animals were involved.&lt;ref name=&quot;RAPC&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.official-documents.gov.uk/document/hc0506/hc16/1660/1660.pdf|format=PDF|title=Report of the Animal Procedures Committee for 2004|year=2004|publisher=Home Office|accessdate=9 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 Beagles were involved in less than 0.3% of the total experiments on animals in the UK, but of the 7670 experiments performed on dogs 7406 involved Beagles (96.6%).&lt;ref name=&quot;REP2005&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.official-documents.gov.uk/document/cm68/6877/6877.pdf|format=PDF|title=Statistics of Scientific Procedures on Living Animals Great Britain 2005|year=2005|publisher=Home Office|accessdate=9 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most dogs are bred specifically for the purpose, by companies such as [[Harlan (company)|Harlan]]. In the UK companies breeding animals for research must be licensed under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act.&lt;ref name=&quot;RAPC&quot; /&gt;
[[Image:Dogs6CCcopy.jpg|left|thumb|Group housed dogs used in safety testing of pharmaceuticals, August 2000]]

Testing of cosmetic products on animals is banned in the member states of European Community,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/cosmetics/html/cosm_animal_test.htm|title=Cosmetics and animal tests|publisher=European Commission&amp;nbsp;— Enterprise and Industry Directorate General|year=2007|accessdate=9 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; although France protested the ban and has made efforts to have it lifted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000085&amp;sid=ahaDhWAXharI&amp;refer=europe|title=Animal-Testing Ban for Cosmetics to Be Upheld, EU Court Rules|publisher=Bloomberg|date=24 May 2005|accessdate=9 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is permitted in the United States but is not mandatory if safety can be ascertained by other methods, and the test species is not specified by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~dms/cos-205.html|title=Animal Testing|publisher=US Food and Drug Administration|year=1999|accessdate=9 July 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070523010844/http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~dms/cos-205.html |archivedate = May 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; When testing toxicity of food additives, food contaminants, and some drugs and chemicals the FDA uses Beagles and [[miniature pig]]s as surrogates for direct human testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/oc/ofacs/fdasbo/businesspub.html|title=How to do Business with FDA|publisher=US Department of Health and Human Services|accessdate=11 July 2007| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20050803014243/http://www.fda.gov/oc/ofacs/fdasbo/businesspub.html| archivedate = August 3, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anti-[[Animal testing|vivisection]] groups have reported on abuse of animals inside testing facilities. In 1997&amp;nbsp;footage secretly filmed by a freelance journalist inside [[Huntingdon Life Sciences]] in the UK showed staff punching and screaming at Beagles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2465/is_2_31/ai_71634854/pg_2|title=Seeing Is Believing&amp;nbsp;— cruelty to dogs at Huntingdon Life Sciences|author=Zoe Broughton|publisher=The Ecologist|month=March | year=2001|accessdate=9 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Consort Kennels]], a UK-based breeder of Beagles for testing, closed down in 1997 after pressure from animal rights groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Nicola Woolcock|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-1749489,00.html|title=Extremists seek fresh targets close to home|publisher=The Times|date=25 August 2005|accessdate=9 July 2007 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medical research===
In the United States where the breeds of dog used are not specified (although Beagles feature heavily in published research papers) the number of tests performed each year on dogs dropped by two-thirds, from 195,157 to 64,932, over the period from 1972 to 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aphis.usda.gov/ac/awreports/awreport2004.pdf|format=PDF|title=FY 2004 AWA Inspections|publisher=United States Department of Agriculture: Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service |year=2004|accessdate=9 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Japan the laws on animal experimentation do not require reporting on the types or number of animals used,&lt;ref name=&quot;UKGOV&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200102/ldselect/ldanimal/150/15004.htm#a10|title=Select Committee on Animals In Scientific Procedures Report |publisher=House of Lords|year=2002|accessdate=9 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in France the proportion of inspectors to testing facilities means the regulatory environment is essentially one of trust.&lt;ref name=&quot;UKGOV&quot; /&gt;

Beagles are used in a range of research procedures: fundamental biological research, applied human medicine, applied veterinary medicine, and protection of man, animals or the environment.&lt;ref name=&quot;REP2005&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;UKGOV&quot; /&gt;

===Other roles===

Although bred for hunting, Beagles are versatile and are nowadays employed for various other roles in detection, therapy, and as family pets.&lt;ref name=&quot;QLD&quot; /&gt;
Beagles are used as sniffer dogs for [[termite]] detection in Australia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.k9centre.com/dogs/detection_dogs_/Termite_Detection_Dogs/termite_detection_dogs.html|title=Termite Detection Dogs|publisher=K9 Centre.com|accessdate=9 July 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070413004000/http://k9centre.com/dogs/detection_dogs_/Termite_Detection_Dogs/termite_detection_dogs.html |archivedate = April 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and have been mentioned as possible candidates for drug and explosive detection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/PARLMENT/hansArt.nsf/V3Key/LC20011213047|title=Police Powers (Drug Detection Dogs) Bill|publisher=Parliament of New South Wales|date=13 December 2001|accessdate=9 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/4676233.stm|title=The unlikely enemy of the terrorist|author=Tom Geoghegan|publisher=BBC News Magazine|date=13 July 2005|accessdate=9 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of their gentle nature and unimposing build, they are also frequently used in [[pet therapy]], visiting the sick and elderly in hospital.&lt;ref&gt;Kraeuter pp.89–92&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2006, a trained Beagle assistance dog was credited with saving the life of its owner after using his owner's mobile phone to dial an emergency number.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/5099190.stm?ls|title=Dog praised for life-saving call|date=20 June 2006|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=9 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the aftermath of the 2010 [[Haiti Earthquake]], a Beagle [[search and rescue dog]] with a Colombian rescue squad was credited with locating the owner of the [[Hôtel Montana]], who was subsequently rescued after spending 100 hours buried in the rubble.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.twincities.com/prep/ci_14260479|title=In Haiti, a shattered symbol reluctantly yields dead|date=25 January 2010|publisher=Twin Cities Pioneer Press|accessdate=26 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
Beagles have been featured across a wide range of media. References to the dog appear before the 19th century in works by such writers as [[William Shakespeare]], [[John Webster]], [[John Dryden]], [[Thomas Tickell]], [[Henry Fielding]] and [[William Cowper]], and in [[Alexander Pope|Alexander Pope's]] translation of [[Homer|Homer's]] ''[[Iliad]]''.{{Ref_label|D|d|none}}

Beagles appeared in [[comic strips]] and [[animated cartoons]] from the 1950s with the ''[[Peanuts]]'' character [[Snoopy]] (billed as &quot;the world's most famous Beagle&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;mostfamousbeagle&quot;/&gt;), [[Odie]] from the comic strip [[Garfield]], [[Walt Disney]]'s [[Beagle Boys]] and Beegle Beagle, the constant companion of [[Hanna-Barbera]]'s [[Grape Ape]].

The Bungle Brothers from [[The Kwicky Koala Show]] are beagles.

They have appeared in numerous films, taking a central role in ''[[Cats &amp; Dogs]]'', ''[[Cats &amp; Dogs: The Revenge of Kitty Galore]]'', and the title roles in the adaptation of [[Phyllis Reynolds Naylor]]'s book ''[[Shiloh (book)|Shiloh]]'' and the live-action version of ''[[Underdog (film)|Underdog]]''. They have played supporting roles in films including ''[[Audition (film)|Audition]]'', ''[[The Monster Squad]]'' and ''[[The Royal Tenenbaums]]'', and on television in ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'', ''[[EastEnders]]'', ''[[The Wonder Years]]'', and ''[[To the Manor Born]]'' among others.

Bagel, one of [[Barry Manilow]]'s two Beagles, appeared on several of his album covers. Former US President [[Lyndon Baines Johnson]] had several Beagles, and caused an outcry when he picked up one of them by its ears during an official greeting on the White House lawn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lbjlib.utexas.edu/johnson/archives.hom/FAQs/dog/doghouse.asp|title=President Johnson's Dogs|publisher=Lyndon Baines Johnson Library and Museum|accessdate=9 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ship on which [[Charles Darwin]] made [[Second voyage of HMS Beagle|his voyage]] which provided the material for his travel book ''[[The Voyage of the Beagle]]'' and much of the inspiration for ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' was named [[HMS Beagle|HMS ''Beagle'']] after the breed, and, in turn, lent its name to the ill-fated British [[Mars|Martian]] lander ''[[Beagle 2]]''.

Breed of the Notorious BIGGIE, the rapping and feasting dog from Michigan. Now owned by the cleaning ladies.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Boiled leather''', sometimes called '''cuir bouilli''', was a historical construction material for [[armour]]. It consists of thick [[leather]], boiled in [[water]] (some sources hold that [[Cooking oil|oil]] and [[wax]] were used as well, others posit the use of [[ammonia]] from fermented animal [[urine]]{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}). The boiling causes the leather to be harder and more brittle. The boiled leather can be fashioned into lames/[[Scale armour|scales]] to make [[lamellar armour|lamellar]] or [[scale armor]]. Or, because the leather remains flexible for a short time after boiling, it can be molded into larger 'plates'.

Cuir bouilli has also been employed to [[bookbinding|bind books]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[computer security]] and [[computer programming|programming]], a '''buffer overflow''', or '''buffer overrun''', is an [[anomaly in software|anomaly]] where a [[computer program|program]], while writing [[data]] to a [[buffer (computer science)|buffer]], overruns the buffer's boundary and overwrites adjacent memory.  This is a special case of violation of [[memory safety]].

Buffer overflows can be triggered by inputs that are designed to execute code, or alter the way the program operates. This may result in erratic program behavior, including memory access errors, incorrect results, a [[crash (computing)|crash]], or a breach of system security. They are thus the basis of many [[vulnerability (computer science)|software vulnerabilities]] and can be maliciously [[exploit (computer security)|exploited]].

[[Programming language]]s commonly associated with buffer overflows include [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[C++]], which provide no built-in protection against accessing or overwriting data in any part of memory and do not automatically check that data written to an array (the built-in buffer type) is within the boundaries of that array. [[Bounds checking]] can prevent buffer overflows.

==Technical description==

A buffer overflow occurs when [[data]] written to a buffer, due to insufficient [[bounds checking]], corrupts data values in [[memory address]]es adjacent to the allocated buffer. Most commonly this occurs when copying [[string (computer science)|strings]] of [[character (computing)|characters]] from one buffer to another.

===Basic example===

In the following example, a program has defined two data items which are adjacent in memory: an 8-byte-long string buffer, A, and a two-byte integer, B. Initially, A contains nothing but zero bytes, and B contains the number 1979. Characters are one byte wide.

| style=&quot;background:#fdd;&quot; | 07 || style=&quot;background:#fdd;&quot; | BB
|}

Now, the program attempts to store the [[null-terminated string]] {{code|&quot;excessive&quot;}} in the A buffer. By failing to check the length of the string, it overwrites the value of B:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;width:30em; text-align:center;&quot;
! style=&quot;white-space:nowrap;&quot; | variable name
! colspan=&quot;8&quot; style=&quot;background:#ddf;&quot; | A

|- style=&quot;background:#ddf; font-family:monospace;&quot;
! style=&quot;font-family:sans;&quot; | value
| 'e' || 'x' || 'c' || 'e' || 's' || 's' || 'i' || 'v'
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; style=&quot;background:#dbd;&quot; | 25856
|- style=&quot;background:#ddf; font-family:monospace;&quot;
! style=&quot;font-family:sans;&quot; | hex
| 65 || 78 || 63 || 65 || 73 || 73 || 69 || 76
| style=&quot;background:#dbd;&quot; | 65 || style=&quot;background:#dbd;&quot; | 00
|}

Although the programmer did not intend to change B at all, B's value has now been replaced by a number formed from part of the character string. In this example, on a [[endianness|big-endian]] system that uses [[ASCII]], &quot;e&quot; followed by a zero byte would become the number 25856. If B was the only other variable data item defined by the program, writing an even longer string that went past the end of B could cause an error such as a [[segmentation fault]], terminating the process.

==Exploitation==

The techniques to [[exploit (computer security)|exploit]] a buffer overflow vulnerability vary per [[computer architecture|architecture]], [[operating system]] and memory region. For example, exploitation on the [[dynamic memory allocation#Heap-based memory allocation|heap]] (used for dynamically allocated memory), is very different from exploitation on the [[call stack]].

===Stack-based exploitation===
{{Main|Stack buffer overflow}}

A technically inclined and malicious user may exploit stack-based buffer overflows to manipulate the program in one of several ways:

* By overwriting a local variable that is near the buffer in memory on the stack to change the behaviour of the program which may benefit the attacker.
* By overwriting the return address in a [[stack frame]]. Once the function returns, execution will resume at the return address as specified by the attacker, usually a user input filled buffer.
* By overwriting a function pointer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/462728/30/150/threaded |title=CORE-2007-0219: OpenBSD's IPv6 mbufs remote kernel buffer overflow |accessdate=2007-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; or exception handler, which is subsequently executed.

With a method called &quot;trampolining&quot;, if the address of the user-supplied data is unknown, but the location is stored in a register, then the return address can be overwritten with the address of an [[opcode]] which will cause execution to jump to the user supplied data. If the location is stored in a register R, then a jump to the location containing the opcode for a jump R, call R or similar instruction, will cause execution of user supplied data. The locations of suitable opcodes, or bytes in memory, can be found in [[dynamic-link library|DLLs]] or the executable itself. However the address of the opcode typically cannot contain any [[null character]]s and the locations of these opcodes can vary between applications and versions of the operating system. The [[Metasploit Project]] is one such database of suitable opcodes, though only those found in the [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] operating system are listed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://metasploit.com/users/opcode/msfopcode.cgi |title=The Metasploit Opcode Database |accessdate=2007-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stack-based buffer overflows are not to be confused with [[stack overflow]]s.

Also note that these vulnerabilities are usually discovered through the use of a [[fuzzer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://raykoid666.wordpress.com |title=The Exploitant - Security info and tutorials |accessdate=2009-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heap-based exploitation===
{{Main|Heap overflow}}

A buffer overflow occurring in the heap data area is referred to as a heap overflow and is exploitable in a different manner to that of stack-based overflows.  Memory on the heap is dynamically allocated by the application at run-time and typically contains program data.  Exploitation is performed by corrupting this data in specific ways to cause the application to overwrite internal structures such as linked list pointers.  The canonical heap overflow technique overwrites dynamic memory allocation linkage (such as [[malloc]] meta data) and uses the resulting pointer exchange to overwrite a program function pointer.

[[Microsoft]]'s [[Graphics Device Interface|GDI+]] vulnerability in handling [[JPEG]]s is an example of the danger a heap overflow can present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS04-028.mspx |title=Microsoft Technet Security Bulletin MS04-028 |accessdate=2007-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Barriers to exploitation===

Manipulation of the buffer, which occurs before it is read or executed, may lead to the failure of an exploitation attempt. These manipulations can mitigate the threat of exploitation, but may not make it impossible. Manipulations could include conversion to upper or lower case, removal of [[metacharacter]]s and filtering out of non-[[alphanumeric]] strings. However, techniques exist to bypass these filters and manipulations; [[alphanumeric code]], [[polymorphic code]], [[self-modifying code]] and [[return-to-libc attack]]s. The same methods can be used to avoid detection by [[intrusion detection system]]s. In some cases, including where code is converted into unicode,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.net-security.org/dl/articles/unicodebo.pdf |title=Creating Arbitrary Shellcode In Unicode Expanded Strings |format=PDF |accessdate=2007-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; the threat of the vulnerability have been misrepresented by the disclosers as only Denial of Service when in fact the remote execution of arbitrary code is possible.

===Practicalities of exploitation===

In real-world exploits there are a variety of challenges which need to be overcome for exploits to operate reliably. These factors include null bytes in addresses, variability in the location of shellcode, differences between environments and various counter-measures in operation.

====NOP sled technique====

{{Main|NOP slide}}

[[Image:nopsled.svg|right|thumb|200px|Illustration of a NOP-sled payload on the stack.]]

A NOP-sled is the oldest and most widely known technique for successfully exploiting a stack buffer overflow.&lt;ref name=&quot;neworder&quot;&gt;{{cite journal
  | author = Vangelis
  | title = Stack-based Overflow Exploit: Introduction to Classical and Advanced Overflow Technique

  | url =http://www.neworder.box.sk/newsread.php?newsid=12476
  | format =text }}&lt;/ref&gt; It solves the problem of finding the exact address of the buffer by effectively increasing the size of the target area. To do this much larger sections of the stack are corrupted with the [[no-op]] machine instruction. At the end of the attacker-supplied data, after the no-op instructions, an instruction to perform a relative jump to the top of the buffer where the [[shellcode]] is located. This collection of no-ops is referred to as the &quot;NOP-sled&quot; because if the return address is overwritten with any address within the no-op region of the buffer it will &quot;slide&quot; down the no-ops until it is redirected to the actual malicious code by the jump at the end. This technique requires the attacker to guess where on the stack the NOP-sled is instead of the comparatively small shellcode.&lt;ref name=&quot;enderunix&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

  | title = Buffer Overflows Demystified
  | publisher = Enderunix.org
  | url =http://www.securityforest.com/downloads/educationtree/bof-eng.txt
  | format =text }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the popularity of this technique, many vendors of [[intrusion prevention system]]s will search for this pattern of no-op machine instructions in an attempt to detect shellcode in use. It is important to note that a NOP-sled does not necessarily contain only traditional no-op machine instructions; any instruction that does not corrupt the machine state to a point where the shellcode will not run can be used in place of the hardware assisted no-op. As a result it has become common practice for exploit writers to compose the no-op sled with randomly chosen instructions which will have no real effect on the shellcode execution.&lt;ref name=&quot;Akritidis1&quot;&gt;{{cite conference

While this method greatly improves the chances that an attack will be successful, it is not without problems. Exploits using this technique still must rely on some amount of luck that they will guess offsets on the stack that are within the NOP-sled region.&lt;ref name=&quot;klein1&quot;&gt;{{cite journal
  | last=Klein

  | format =PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt; An incorrect guess will usually result in the target program crashing and could alert the [[system administrator]] to the attacker's activities. Another problem is that the NOP-sled requires a much larger amount of memory in which to hold a NOP-sled large enough to be of any use. This can be a problem when the allocated size of the affected buffer is too small and the current depth of the stack is shallow (i.e. there is not much space from the end of the current stack frame to the start of the stack). Despite its problems, the NOP-sled is often the only method that will work for a given platform, environment, or situation; as such it is still an important technique.

====The jump to address stored in a register technique====

The &quot;jump to register&quot; technique allows for reliable exploitation of stack buffer overflows without the need for extra room for a NOP-sled and without having to guess stack offsets. The strategy is to overwrite the return pointer with something that will cause the program to jump to a known pointer stored within a register which points to the controlled buffer and thus the shellcode. For example if register A contains a pointer to the start of a buffer then any jump or call taking that register as an operand can be used to gain control of the flow of execution.&lt;ref name=&quot;shah&quot;&gt;{{cite conference

In practice a program may not intentionally contain instructions to jump to a particular register. The traditional solution is to find an unintentional instance of a suitable [[opcode]] at a fixed location somewhere within the program memory. In figure [[:Image:JumpToEsp.png|E]] on the left you can see an example of such an unintentional instance of the i386 &lt;code&gt;jmp esp&lt;/code&gt; instruction. The opcode for this instruction is &lt;code&gt;FF E4&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;ref name=&quot;intel1&quot;&gt;{{cite book

If an attacker overwrites the program return address with this address the program will first jump to &lt;code&gt;0x7C941EED&lt;/code&gt;, interpret the opcode &lt;code&gt;FF E4&lt;/code&gt; as the &lt;code&gt;jmp esp&lt;/code&gt; instruction, and will then jump to the top of the stack and execute the attacker's code.&lt;ref name=&quot;packetstorm1&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

  | format =PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When this technique is possible the severity of the vulnerability increases considerably. This is because exploitation will work reliably enough to automate an attack with a virtual guarantee of success when it is run. For this reason, this is the technique most commonly used in [[Internet worm]]s that exploit stack buffer overflow vulnerabilities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Yuji1&quot;&gt;

This method also allows shellcode to be placed after the overwritten return address on the Windows platform. Since executables are mostly based at address &lt;code&gt;0x00400000&lt;/code&gt; and x86 is a [[endianness#Little-endian|Little Endian]] architecture, the last byte of the return address must be a null, which terminates the buffer copy and nothing is written beyond that. This limits the size of the shellcode to the size of the buffer, which may be overly restrictive. DLLs are located in high memory (above &lt;code&gt;0x01000000&lt;/code&gt;) and so have addresses containing no null bytes, so this method can remove null bytes (or other disallowed characters) from the overwritten return address. Used in this way, the method is often referred to as &quot;DLL Trampolining&quot;.

==Protective countermeasures==

Various techniques have been used to detect or prevent buffer overflows, with various tradeoffs. The most reliable way to avoid or prevent buffer overflows is to use automatic protection at the language level. This sort of protection, however, cannot be applied to [[legacy code]], and often technical, business, or cultural constraints call for a vulnerable language. The following sections describe the choices and implementations available.

===Choice of programming language===

The choice of programming language can have a profound effect on the occurrence of buffer overflows. {{As of|2008}}, among the most popular languages are [[C (programming language)|C]] and its derivative, [[C++]], with a vast body of software having been written in these languages. C and C++ provide no built-in protection against accessing or overwriting data in any part of memory; more specifically, they do not check that data written to a buffer is within the boundaries of that buffer. However, the standard C++ libraries provide many ways of safely buffering data, and techniques to avoid buffer overflows also exist for C.

Many other programming languages provide runtime checking and in some cases even compile-time checking which might send a warning or raise an [[exception handling|exception]] when C or C++ would overwrite data and continue to execute further instructions until erroneous results are obtained which might or might not cause the program to crash.  Examples of such languages include [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]], [[Eiffel (programming language)|Eiffel]], [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]], [[Modula-2]], [[Smalltalk]], [[Objective Caml]] and such C-derivatives as [[Cyclone (programming language)|Cyclone]] and [[D (programming language)|D]]. The [[Java (software platform)|Java]] and [[.NET Framework]] bytecode environments also require bounds checking on all arrays. Nearly every [[interpreted programming language|interpreted language]] will protect against buffer overflows, signalling a well-defined error condition. Often where a language provides enough type information to do bounds checking an option is provided to enable or disable it. [[Static code analysis]] can remove many dynamic bound and type checks, but poor implementations and awkward cases can significantly decrease performance. Software engineers must carefully consider the tradeoffs of safety versus performance costs when deciding which language and compiler setting to use.

===Use of safe libraries===

The problem of buffer overflows is common in the C and C++ languages because they expose low level representational details of buffers as containers for data types.  Buffer overflows must thus be avoided by maintaining a high degree of correctness in code which performs buffer management. It has also long been recommended to avoid standard library functions which are not bounds checked, such as &lt;code&gt;[[gets]]&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;[[scanf]]&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;[[strcpy]]&lt;/code&gt;. The [[Morris worm]] exploited a &lt;code&gt;gets&lt;/code&gt; call in [[fingerd]].&lt;ref&gt;http://wiretap.area.com/Gopher/Library/Techdoc/Virus/inetvir.823&lt;/ref&gt;

Well-written and tested abstract data type libraries which centralize and automatically perform buffer management, including bounds checking, can reduce the occurrence and impact of buffer overflows.  The two main building-block data types in these languages in which buffer overflows commonly occur are strings and arrays; thus, libraries preventing buffer overflows in these data types can provide the vast majority of the necessary coverage.  Still, failure to use these safe libraries correctly can result in buffer overflows and other vulnerabilities; and naturally, any bug in the library itself is a potential vulnerability. &quot;Safe&quot; library implementations include &quot;The Better String Library&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bstring.sf.net/ |title=The Better String Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vstr &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.and.org/vstr/ |title=The Vstr Homepage |accessdate=2007-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Erwin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theiling.de/projects/erwin.html |title=The Erwin Homepage |accessdate=2007-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[OpenBSD]] operating system's [[C library]] provides the [[strlcpy]] and [[strlcat]] functions, but these are more limited than full safe library implementations.

In September 2007, Technical Report 24731, prepared by the C standards committee, was published;{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} it specifies a set of functions which are based on the standard C library's string and I/O functions, with additional buffer-size parameters.  However, the efficacy of these functions for the purpose of reducing buffer overflows is disputable; it requires programmer intervention on a per function call basis that is equivalent to intervention that could make the analogous older standard library functions buffer overflow safe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.securecoding.cert.org/confluence/x/QwY |title=CERT Secure Coding Initiative |accessdate=2007-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buffer overflow protection===
{{Main|Buffer overflow protection}}

Buffer overflow protection is used to detect the most common buffer overflows by checking that the [[call stack|stack]] has not been altered when a function returns.  If it has been altered, the program exits with a [[segmentation fault]]. Three such systems are Libsafe,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://directory.fsf.org/libsafe.html |title=Libsafe at FSF.org |accessdate=2007-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[StackGuard]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.usenix.org/publications/library/proceedings/sec98/full_papers/cowan/cowan.pdf |title=StackGuard: Automatic Adaptive Detection and Prevention of Buffer-Overflow Attacks by Cowan et al. |format=PDF |accessdate=2007-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[ProPolice]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wiki.x.org/wiki/ProPolice |title=ProPolice at X.ORG |accessdate=2007-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[GNU Compiler Collection|gcc]] patches.

Microsoft's [[Data Execution Prevention]] mode explicitly protects the pointer to the SEH Exception Handler from being overwritten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uninformed.org/?v=2&amp;a=4&amp;t=txt |title=Bypassing Windows Hardware-enforced Data Execution Prevention |accessdate=2007-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stronger stack protection is possible by splitting the stack in two: one for data and one for function returns.  This split is present in the [[Forth (programming language)|Forth language]], though it was not a security-based design decision.  Regardless, this is not a complete solution to buffer overflows, as sensitive data other than the return address may still be overwritten.

===Pointer protection===

Buffer overflows work by manipulating pointers (including stored addresses).  PointGuard was proposed as a compiler-extension to prevent attackers from being able to reliably manipulate pointers and addresses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usenix.org/events/sec03/tech/full_papers/cowan/cowan_html/index.html PointGuard: Protecting Pointers From Buffer Overflow Vulnerabilities]&lt;/ref&gt;  The approach works by having the compiler add code to automatically XOR-encode pointers before and after they are used.  Because the attacker (theoretically) does not know what value will be used to encode/decode the pointer, he cannot predict what it will point to if he overwrites it with a new value.  PointGuard was never released, but Microsoft implemented a similar approach beginning in Windows XP SP2 and Windows Server 2003 SP1.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.msdn.com/michael_howard/archive/2006/01/30/520200.aspx Protecting Against Pointer Subterfuge (Kinda!)]&lt;/ref&gt;  Rather than implement pointer protection as an automatic feature, Microsoft added an API routine that can be called at the discretion of the programmer.  This allows for better performance (because it is not used all of the time), but places the burden on the programmer to know when it is necessary.

Because XOR is linear, an attacker may be able to manipulate an encoded pointer by overwriting only the lower bytes of an address.  This can allow an attack to succeed if the attacker is able to attempt the exploit multiple times and/or is able to complete an attack by causing a pointer to point to one of several locations (such as any location within a NOP sled).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usenix.org/publications/login/2005-06/pdfs/alexander0506.pdf Defeating Compiler-Level Buffer Overflow Protection]&lt;/ref&gt;  Microsoft added a random rotation to their encoding scheme to address this weakness to partial overwrites.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.msdn.com/michael_howard/archive/2006/08/16/702707.aspx Protecting against Pointer Subterfuge (Redux)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Executable space protection===
{{Main|Executable space protection}}

Executable space protection is an approach to buffer overflow protection which prevents execution of code on the stack or the heap. An attacker may use buffer overflows to insert arbitrary code into the memory of a program, but with executable space protection, any attempt to execute that code will cause an exception.

Some CPUs support a feature called [[NX bit|NX]] (&quot;No eXecute&quot;) or [[XD bit|XD]] (&quot;eXecute Disabled&quot;) bit, which in conjunction with software, can be used to mark [[paging|pages of data]] (such as those containing the stack and the heap) as readable and writeable but not executable.

Some Unix operating systems (e.g. [[OpenBSD]], [[Mac OS X]]) ship with executable space protection (e.g. [[W^X]]). Some optional packages include:

* [[PaX]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=PaX: Homepage of the PaX team |url=http://pax.grsecurity.net |accessdate=2007-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Exec Shield]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=KernelTrap.Org |url=http://kerneltrap.org/node/644 |accessdate=2007-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Openwall]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Openwall Linux kernel patch 2.4.34-ow1 |url=http://linux.softpedia.com/get/System/Operating-Systems/Kernels/Openwall-Linux-kernel-patch-16454.shtml |accessdate=2007-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Newer variants of Microsoft Windows also support executable space protection, called [[Data Execution Prevention]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Microsoft Technet: Data Execution Prevention |url=http://technet2.microsoft.com/WindowsServer/en/Library/b0de1052-4101-44c3-a294-4da1bd1ef2271033.mspx?mfr=true }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[proprietary software|Proprietary]] add-ons include:

* BufferShield&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=BufferShield: Prevention of Buffer Overflow Exploitation for Windows |url=http://www.sys-manage.com/english/products/products_BufferShield.html |accessdate=2007-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* StackDefender&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=NGSec Stack Defender |url=http://www.ngsec.com/ngproducts/stackdefender/ |accessdate=2007-06-03 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070513235539/http://www.ngsec.com/ngproducts/stackdefender/ &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Executable space protection does not generally protect against [[return-to-libc attack]]s, or any other attack which does not rely on the execution of the attackers code. However, on [[64-bit]] systems using [[ASLR]], as described below, executable space protection makes it far more difficult to execute such attacks.

===Address space layout randomization===
{{Main|Address space layout randomization}}

Address space layout randomization (ASLR) is a computer security feature which involves arranging the positions of key data areas, usually including the base of the executable and position of libraries, heap, and stack, randomly in a process' address space.

Randomization of the [[virtual memory]] addresses at which functions and variables can be found can make exploitation of a buffer overflow more difficult, but not impossible. It also forces the attacker to tailor the exploitation attempt to the individual system, which foils the attempts of [[internet worm]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=PaX at GRSecurity.net |url=http://pax.grsecurity.net/docs/aslr.txt |accessdate=2007-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar but less effective method is to [[rebasing|rebase]] processes and libraries in the virtual address space.

===Deep packet inspection===
{{Main|Deep packet inspection}}

The use of deep packet inspection (DPI) can detect, at the network perimeter, very basic remote attempts to exploit buffer overflows by use of attack signatures and [[heuristic (computer science)|heuristics]]. These are able to block packets which have the signature of a known attack, or if a long series of No-Operation instructions (known as a nop-sled) is detected, these were once used when the location of the exploit's [[payload (software)|payload]] is slightly variable.

Packet scanning is not an effective method since it can only prevent known attacks and there are many ways that a 'nop-sled' can be encoded. [[Shellcode]] used by attackers can be made [[alphanumeric code|alphanumeric]], [[metamorphic code|metamorphic]], or [[self-modifying code|self-modifying]] to evade detection by heuristic packet scanners and [[intrusion detection system]]s.

==History of exploitation==

The earliest documented hostile exploitation of a buffer overflow was in 1988. It was one of several exploits  used by the [[Morris worm]] to propagate itself over the Internet. The program exploited was a [[service (computing)|service]] on [[Unix]] called [[Finger protocol|finger]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=&quot;A Tour of The Worm&quot; by Donn Seeley, University of Utah |url=http://world.std.com/~franl/worm.html |accessdate=2007-06-03 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070520233435/http://world.std.com/~franl/worm.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in 1995, Thomas Lopatic independently rediscovered the buffer overflow and published his findings on the [[Bugtraq]] security mailing list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bugtraq security mailing list archive |url=http://www.security-express.com/archives/bugtraq/1995_1/0403.html |accessdate=2007-06-03 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070901222723/http://www.security-express.com/archives/bugtraq/1995_1/0403.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; A year later, in 1996, [[Elias Levy]] (aka Aleph One) published in ''[[Phrack]]'' magazine the paper &quot;Smashing the Stack for Fun and Profit&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=&quot;Smashing the Stack for Fun and Profit&quot; by Aleph One |url=http://doc.bughunter.net/buffer-overflow/smash-stack.html |accessdate=2007-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; a step-by-step introduction to exploiting stack-based buffer overflow vulnerabilities.

Since then, at least two major internet worms have exploited buffer overflows to compromise a large number of systems. In 2001, the [[Code Red worm]] exploited a buffer overflow in Microsoft's [[Internet Information Services]] (IIS) 5.0&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=eEye Digital Security |url=http://research.eeye.com/html/advisories/published/AL20010717.html |accessdate=2007-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2003 the [[SQL Slammer]] worm compromised machines running [[Microsoft SQL Server 2000]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Microsoft Technet Security Bulletin MS02-039 |url=http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms02-039.mspx |accessdate=2007-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, buffer overflows present in licensed [[Xbox]] games have been exploited to allow unlicensed software, including [[homebrew (video games)|homebrew games]], to run on the console without the need for hardware modifications, known as [[modchip]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/content_page.php?aid=1461 |title=Hacker breaks Xbox protection without mod-chip |accessdate=2007-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[PS2 Independence Exploit]] also used a buffer overflow to achieve the same for the [[PlayStation 2]]. The [[Twilight hack]] accomplished the same with the [[Wii]], using a buffer overflow in ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess]]''.

He slugged .749, walked 148 times, and had an on-base average well over .500 (.529) for the third straight year.&lt;ref name=br-stats/&gt; He also became the only member of the career 500 home run/500 stolen base club by stealing second base on June 23 off of pitcher [[Eric Gagne]] in the 11th inning of a tied ball game to against the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] (who Bonds had ironically tallied his 500th home run against).

In 2004, Bonds had perhaps his best season. He hit .362 en route to his second National League batting title, and broke his own record by walking 232 times. He slugged .812, which was fourth-highest of all time, and broke his on-base percentage record with a .609 average.

As Bonds neared Aaron's record, Aaron was called on for his opinion of Bonds. He clarified that he was a fan and admirer of Bonds and avoided the controversy regarding whether the record should be denoted with an asterisk due to Bonds' alleged steroid usage. He felt recognition and respect for the award was something to be determined by the fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F04E3DB1738F934A35757C0A9629C8B63|title= Sports of The Times; Aaron Will Let the Fans Judge Bonds|accessdate=2008-05-27|date=2004-04-07|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|work=[[The New York Times]]|author=Anderson, Dave}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the steroid controversy received greater media attention during the offseason before the 2005 season, Aaron expressed some reservations about the statements Bonds made on the issue. Aaron expressed that he felt drug and steroid use to boost athletic performance was inappropriate. Aaron was frustrated that the media could not focus on events that occurred in the field of play and wished drugs or gambling allegations such as those associated with [[Pete Rose]] could be emphasized less.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=1939208|title=HOF and asterisks not up to Aaron|accessdate=2008-05-27|date=2004-12-06|work=[[ESPN.com]]|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Aaron felt the whole steroid use issue was very controversial and decided that he would not attend any possible record-breaking games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=2879440|title=If Bonds breaks HR record, Aaron 'won't be there'|accessdate=2008-05-27|date=2007-05-22|work=[[ESPN.com]]|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aaron congratulated Bonds through the media when Bonds broke Aaron's record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/2007-08-08-bonds-756_N.htm|title=Bonds blasts No. 756 to take over top spot|accessdate=2008-05-27|date=2007-08-07|publisher=[[USA TODAY]]|author=Nightengale, Bob}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bonds' salary for the 2005 season was $22 million, the second-highest salary in Major League Baseball (the [[New York Yankees|Yankees]]' [[Alex Rodriguez]] earned the highest, $25.2 million).&lt;ref name=BRSalaries&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/leaders/leaders_salaries.shtml|title=Highest Career Total and Single-Season Salaries|accessdate=2007-09-29|work=[[Baseball-Reference]]|publisher=Sports Reference, Inc.|date=2007-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Bonds endured a knee injury, multiple surgeries, and rehabilitation. He was activated on September 12 and started in left field. In his return against the [[San Diego Padres]], he nearly hit a home run in his first at-bat. Bonds finished the night 1-for-4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/recap?gameId=250912126|title=Giant comeback: Bonds 1-for-4 in winning return|accessdate=2008-04-17|date=2005-09-12|work=[[ESPN.com]]|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon his return, Bonds resumed his high-caliber performance at the plate, hitting home runs in four consecutive games from September 18 to September 21 and finishing with five homers in only 14 games.&lt;ref name=br-stats/&gt;

====2006 season====
[[File:Barry Bonds3.jpg|thumb|Bonds batting against the Chicago Cubs in 2006]]
In 2006, Bonds earned $20 million (not including bonuses), the fourth highest salary in baseball. Through the 2006 season he had earned approximately $172 million during his then 21-year career, making him baseball's all-time highest paid player.&lt;ref name=BRSalaries/&gt; Bonds hit under .200 for his first 10 games of the season and did not hit a home run until April 22.

Then, on May 20, Bonds tied Ruth, hitting his 714th career home run to deep right field to lead off the top of the 2nd inning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/recap?gameId=260520111|accessdate=2007-07-02|date=2006-05-20|title=Bonds reels in Babe, blasts home run No. 714|work=[[ESPN.com]]|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures}}&lt;/ref&gt; The home run came off left-handed pitcher [[Brad Halsey]] of the [[Oakland Athletics|Oakland A's]], in an [[interleague play|interleague]] game played in [[Oakland, California]].

On September 22, Bonds tied Henry Aaron's National League career home run record of 733. The home run came in the top of the 6th inning of a high-scoring game against the Milwaukee Brewers, at [[Miller Park (Milwaukee)|Miller Park]] in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The achievement was notable for its occurrence in the very city where Aaron began (with the Milwaukee Braves) and concluded (with the Brewers, then in the American League) his career. With the Giants trailing 10–8, Bonds hit a blast to deep center field on a 2–0 pitch off the Brewers' [[Chris Spurling]] with runners on first and second and one out. Though the Giants were at the time clinging to only a slim chance of making the playoffs, Bonds' home run provided the additional drama of giving the Giants an 11–10 lead late in a critical game in the final days of a pennant race. The Brewers eventually won the game, 13–12, despite Bonds' going 3 for 5, with 2 doubles, the record-tying home run, and 6 runs batted in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/recap?gameId=260922108|accessdate=2007-07-02|date=2006-09-22|title=Bonds ties Aaron's NL HR mark, but Giants fall to Brewers|work=[[ESPN.com]]|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 23, Bonds surpassed Aaron for the NL career home run record. Hit in Milwaukee like the previous one, this was a solo home run off [[Chris Capuano]] of the Brewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/recap?gameId=260923108|accessdate=2007-07-02|date=2006-09-23|title=Bonds hits NL-record 734th HR, but Giants lose again|work=[[ESPN.com]]|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the last home run Bonds hit in 2006. In 2006, Bonds recorded his lowest [[slugging percentage]] (a statistic that he has historically ranked among league leaders season after season) since 1991 with the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]].&lt;ref name=br-stats/&gt;

In January 2007, the ''[[New York Daily News]]'' reported that Bonds had tested positive for [[amphetamine]]s.&lt;ref name=NYP011107&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/01112007/sports/report__bonds_used_speed_sports_.htm|accessdate=2007-09-04|title=Report: Bonds used 'speed'|date=2007-01-11|work=[[New York Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under baseball's amphetamine policy, which had been in effect for one season, players testing positive were to submit to six additional tests and undergo treatment and counseling.&lt;ref name=NYP011107/&gt; The policy also stated that players were not to be identified for a first positive test, but the ''New York Daily News'' leaked the test's results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=2727325|accessdate=2007-09-04|date=2007-01-11|title=Report: Bonds failed amphetamine test|author=|work=[[ESPN.com]]|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the Players Association informed Bonds of the test results, he initially attributed it to a substance he had taken from the locker of Giants teammate [[Mark Sweeney]],&lt;ref name=NYP011107/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2007/baseball/mlb/01/11/bonds.amphetamines/index.html|accessdate=2007-09-04|date=2007-01-11|title=Caught in the act|author=Quinn, T.J.|work=[[SI.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; but would later retract this claim and publicly apologize to Sweeney.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/chronicle/archive/2007/02/20/SPGV7O7HBH1.DTL|accessdate=2007-09-04|date=2007-02-20|title=Sweeney: It's 'over and done': Giants don't expect another apology from Bonds|author=Schulman, Henry|work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|publisher=[[Hearst Communications Inc.]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 29, 2007, the Giants finalized a contract with Bonds for the 2007 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sanfrancisco.giants.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20070129&amp;content_id=1789025&amp;vkey=news_sf&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=sf|title=Bonds, Giants agree to deal|date=2007-01-29|accessdate=2007-09-25|work=[[MLB.com]]|author=Bloom, Barry M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the commissioner's office rejected Bonds's one-year, $15.8 million deal because it contained a personal-appearance provision, the team sent revised documents to his agent, Jeff Borris, who stated that &quot;At this time, Barry is not signing the new documents.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4155/is_20070201/ai_n18626981|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071013195011/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4155/is_20070201/ai_n18626981|archivedate=2007-10-13 |title=Agent: Bonds won't sign revised contract right now|date=2007-02-01|accessdate=2007-09-25|publisher=FindArticles|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bonds signed a revised one-year, $15.8 million contract on February 15 and reported to the Giants' Spring Training camp on time.

Bonds resumed his march to the all-time record early in the 2007 season. After an opening game in which all he had was a first-inning single past third base against a right-shifted infield (immediately followed by a stolen base and then a base-running misjudgment that got him thrown out at home) and a deep out to left field late in the game,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/recap?gid=270403126|title=San Diego 7, San Francisco 0 (recap)|accessdate=2007-04-14|publisher=[[Yahoo!

In his first at-bat of the season's second game at the Giants' AT&amp;T Park, Bonds hit a [[Chris Young (baseball pitcher)|Chris Young]] (of the San Diego Padres) pitch just over the wall to the left of straightaway center field for career home run 735.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/recap?gid=270404126|title=San Diego 5, San Francisco 3 (recap)|accessdate=2007-04-14|publisher=[[Yahoo!

The hype surrounding Bonds' pursuit of the home run record escalated on May 14. On this day, Sports Auction for Heritage (a Dallas-based auction house) offered US$1 million to the fan that caught Bonds' record-breaking 756th-career home run.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=2869244|accessdate=2007-06-30|date=2007-05-14|title=Auction house willing to buy 756 ball for $1M|work=[[ESPN.com]]|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures}}&lt;/ref&gt; The million dollar offer was rescinded on June 11 out of concern of fan safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=2900735|accessdate=2007-06-30|date=2007-06-12|title=Auction house withdraws $1M bounty on No. 756|work=[[ESPN.com]]|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures}}&lt;/ref&gt; Home run, 748, came on Father's Day, June 17, in the final game of a 3-game road series against the Boston Red Sox at [[Fenway Park]], where Bonds had never previously played.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/recap?gameId=270617102|accessdate=2007-06-30|date=2007-06-17|title=Bonds hits first Fenway homer in loss to Red Sox|work=[[ESPN.com]]|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this homer, Fenway Park became the 36th major league ballpark in which Bonds had hit a home run. He hit a [[Tim Wakefield]] knuckleball just over the low fence into the Giant's bullpen in right field. It was his first home run off his former Pittsburgh Pirate teammate, who became the 441st different pitcher to surrender a four-bagger to Bonds. The 750th career home run, hit on June 29, also came off a former teammate: [[Liván Hernández]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scores.espn.go.com/mlb/recap?gameId=270629126|accessdate=2007-06-30|date=2007-06-29|title=Bonds is 5 homers shy of Aaron's mark after loss in 10th|work=[[ESPN.com]]|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures}}&lt;/ref&gt; The blast came in the 8th inning and at that point tied the game at 3–3.

==Controversies==
===BALCO scandal===
[[File:Barry bonds mug shot 1.jpg|right|thumb|150px|mug shot taken after 2007 indictment]]
Since 2003, Bonds has been a key figure in the Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative ([[Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative|BALCO]]) scandal. He was under investigation by a federal [[grand jury]] regarding his testimony in the BALCO case, and was indicted on [[perjury]] and [[obstruction of justice]] charges on November 15, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;

In 2003, Bonds became embroiled in a scandal when [[Greg Anderson (trainer)|Greg Anderson]] of the [[BALCO|Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative]] (BALCO), Bonds' trainer since 2000, was indicted by a federal [[grand jury]] in the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California]] and charged with supplying [[anabolic steroids]] to athletes, including a number of baseball players. This led to speculation that Bonds had used performance-enhancing drugs during a time when there was no mandatory testing in Major League Baseball. Bonds declared his innocence, attributing his changed physique and increased power to a strict regimen of bodybuilding, diet and legitimate supplements.&lt;ref name=Bttsdw&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=1937594|title=Bonds testified that substances didn't work|accessdate=2008-02-20|date=2004-12-04|work=[[ESPN.com]]|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During grand jury testimony on December 4, 2003,&lt;ref name=BlEg2yip/&gt; Bonds said that he used a clear substance and a cream that he received from his personal strength trainer, Greg Anderson, who told him they were the nutritional supplement flaxseed oil and a rubbing balm for arthritis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2004/12/03/MNGGFA0UDU65.DTL|title=What Bonds told BALCO grand jury|date=2004-12-03|accessdate=2007-10-10|publisher=[[Hearst Communications Inc.]]|work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|author=Williams, Lance, Mark Fainaru-Wada}}&lt;/ref&gt; This testimony, as reported by [[Lance Williams]] and [[Mark Fainaru-Wada]], has frequently been misrepresented. Later reports on Bonds's leaked grand-jury testimony contend that he admitted to unknowingly using &quot;[[the cream]]&quot; and &quot;[[Tetrahydrogestrinone|the clear]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=Bttsdw/&gt;

In July 2005, all four defendants in the BALCO steroid scandal trial, including Anderson, struck deals with federal prosecutors that did not require them to reveal names of athletes who may have used banned drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2005/07/16/MNG7PDP6HA1.DTL | title=40 of 42 BALCO charges dropped – Steroid lab owner, Bonds' trainer guilty in plea deal | publisher=[[Hearst Communications Inc.]]|work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] | date=2005-07-16 | accessdate=2008-02-20 |author=Fainaru-Wada, Mark and Lance Williams}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Perjury investigation and federal indictment===
{{main|Barry Bonds perjury case}}
On November 15, 2007, Bonds was indicted on four counts of [[perjury]] and one count of [[obstruction of justice]] as it relates to the government investigation of BALCO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7097583.stm|title=Baseball star Barry Bonds charged|work=[[BBC News]]|date=2007-11-16|accessdate=2008-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 14, 2008 a [[typo]] in court papers filed by Federal prosecutors erroneously alleged that Bonds tested positive for steroids in November, 2001, a month after hitting his record 73rd home run. The reference was meant instead to refer to a November 2000 test that had already been disclosed and previously reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=3246675&amp;campaign=rss&amp;source=ESPNHeadlines|title=U.S. filing typo spurs erroneous Bonds drug report|author = |work=[[ESPN.com]]|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures|date=2008-02-15|accessdate=2008-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The typo sparked a brief media frenzy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,330742,00.html|title=Court Document Typo Spurs Erroneous Bonds Drug Allegation|author = |work=[[Fox News]]|date=2008-02-15|accessdate=2010-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His trial for obstruction of justice was to have begun on March 2, 2009, but jury selection was postponed due to 11th-hour appeals by the prosecution.&lt;ref name=&quot;deny appeal&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=3940754|title=Bonds trial faces long delay for appeal|accessdate=2009-06-04|work=[[ESPN.com]]|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures|author=Mark Fainaru-Wada}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trial commenced on March 21, 2011, in U. S. District Court, Northern District of California, Judge Susan Illston presiding.&lt;ref name=BBgMtd/&gt; Writers with ''[[The New York Times]]'' do not expect Bonds to get prison time after pro cyclist Tammy Thomas received house arrest and probation for similar crimes in the BALCO scandal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/11/sports/othersports/11doping.html?|title=Cyclist Avoids Prison Time, Which May Benefit Bonds|accessdate=2008-10-12|date=2008-10-10|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|work=[[The New York Times]]|author=Pogash, Carol and Michael S. Schmidt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Players' Union===
Bonds withdrew from the [[Major League Baseball Players Association|MLB Players Association]]'s (MLBPA) [[license|licensing]] agreement because he felt independent marketing deals would be more lucrative for him. Bonds is the first player in the thirty-year history of the licensing program not to sign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=1661883|title=Bonds will be individually licensed|accessdate=2008-02-20|work=[[ESPN.com]]|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures|date=2003-11-17|author=Rovell, Darren}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this withdrawal, his name and likeness are not usable in any merchandise licensed by the MLBPA. In order to use his name or likeness, a company must deal directly with Bonds. For this reason he does not appear in some baseball [[video games]], forcing game-makers to create generic athletes to replace him. For example, Bonds is replaced by &quot;[[Jon Dowd]]&quot; in ''[[MVP Baseball 2005]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/sportsbusiness/news/story?id=1777084|title=Bonds flexes his muscles|accessdate=2010-09-11|work=[[ESPN.com]]|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures|author=Rovell, Darren|date=2007-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- Unable to find refs &quot;Wes Mailman&quot; in ''[[All-Star Baseball 2005]]'', &quot;Joe Young&quot; in [[MLB 2K7]], Backyard Baseball 2007 and &quot;Dean Gibeau&quot; in ''All-Star Baseball 2006 ''and &quot;Reggie Stocker&quot; in ''[[MLB 07: The Show]]''.

The book alleges Bonds used [[stanozolol]] and a host of other steroids, and is perhaps most responsible for the change in public opinion regarding Bonds' steroid use.&lt;ref name=TTABBaS&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2006/magazine/03/06/growth0313/|title=The Truth About Barry Bonds and Steroids|publisher=[[Time Inc.]]|work=[[SI.com]]|accessdate=2008-02-20|author=Fainaru-Wada, Mark and Lance Williams}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/23/books/23kaku.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin|title=Barry Bonds and Baseball's Steroids Scandal|accessdate=2008-02-20|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|work=[[New York Times]]|date=2006-03-23|author=Kakutani, Michiko}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book contained excerpts of grand jury testimony that is supposed to be sealed and confidential by law.

===''Love Me, Hate Me''===
In May 2006, former ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' writer [[Jeff Pearlman]] released a revealing biography of Bonds entitled ''Love Me, Hate Me: Barry Bonds and the Making of an Anti-Hero.'' The book also contained many allegations against Bonds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06099/680058-148.stm|title='Love Me, Hate Me: Barry Bonds and the Making of an Antihero' by Jeff Pearlman|accessdate=2008-02-20|publisher=PG Publishing Co., Inc.|work=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|date=2006-04-09|author=Caroulis, Jon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book, which describes Bonds as a polarizing insufferable braggart with a legendary ego and staggering ability, relied on over five hundred interviews, except with Bonds himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.harpercollins.com/books/9780061191923/Love_Me_Hate_Me/index.aspx|title=Love Me, Hate Me|accessdate=2008-02-20|publisher=[[HarperCollins|HarperCollins Publishers]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Book of Numbers''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: Αριθμοί ''arithmoi'' meaning &quot;numbers&quot;) or '''Bəmidbar'''&lt;!--It's Bəmidbar (with a shewa), not Bamidbar (with a patach)--&gt; ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: במדבר, literally &quot;In the desert [of]&quot;) is the fourth book of the [[Hebrew Bible]], and the fourth of five books of the Jewish [[Torah]]/[[Pentateuch]]. This book may be divided into three parts:

#The numbering of the people at Sinai, and preparations for resuming their march (1–10:10).
#An account of the journey from Sinai to Moab, the sending out of the spies and the report they brought back, the murmurings (eight times) of the people at the hardships by the way, and the subsequent exile into the wilderness for 40 years (10:11–21:20).
#The transactions in the plain of Moab before crossing the [[Jordan River]] (21:21–36).

The period comprehended in the history extends from the second month of the second year, as measured from [[the Exodus]], to the beginning of the eleventh month of the fortieth year, in all about thirty-seven years and nine months; a dreary period of wanderings. They were fewer in number at the end of their wanderings than when they left the land of [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]]. According to tradition, [[Moses]] authored all five books of the Torah. 

There is a growing consensus among scholars that the book dates from the early Persian period (5th century BCE), and is a reworking of various traditions dating back as far as the 8th century.

==Title==
The Hebrew title ''Bəmidbar'', short for ''bəmidbar Sinai'' (&quot;in the desert of Sinai&quot;), is taken from the first verse, and &quot;serves to foreground the years of testing in the wilderness that make up the central section of the book (chapters 11–21).&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Goswell, &quot;What's in a Name? Book Titles in the Torah and Former Prophets,&quot; ''Pacifica'' 20 (2007), 268.&lt;/ref&gt; The English title ''Numbers'' is derived from the Greek of the Septuagint, referencing the numbering of the Israelites in the wilderness of [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]] and later on the plain of [[Moab]].

==Summary==
{{Books of the Old Testament}}

===Numbering God's people===
:''See also:''
: *''[[Bamidbar (parsha)|Bamidbar]], on Numbers 1-4: First census, priestly duties
: *''[[Naso (parsha)|Naso]], on Numbers 4-7: Priestly duties, the camp, unfaithfulness and the Nazirite, Tabernacle consecration

God orders Moses, in the wilderness of Sinai, to take number of those able to bear arms&amp;mdash;of all the men &quot;from twenty years old and upward,&quot; and to appoint princes over each tribe. 603,550 Israelites are found to be fit for military service.  In chapter 26, a generation later and after approximately forty years of wandering the desert, the Lord orders a second census.  601,730 men are counted.  

The [[Levite|tribe of Levi]] is exempted from military service and therefore not included in the census totals.  Moses consecrates the Levites for the service of the Tabernacle in the place of the first-born sons, who hitherto had performed that service. The Levites are divided into three families, the Gershonites, the Kohathites, and the Merarites, each under a chief, and all headed by one prince, [[Eleazar]], son of [[Aaron]]. Preparations are then made for resuming the march to the [[Promised Land]]. Various ordinances and laws are decreed.

===Forty years in the wilderness===
:''See also:''
: *''[[Behaalotecha]], on Numbers 8-12: Levites, journing by cloud and fire, complaints, questioning of Moses
: *''[[Shlach]], on Numbers 13-15: Mixed report of the scouts and Israel's response
: *''[[Korach (parsha)|Korach]], on Numbers 16-18: Korah’s rebellion, plague, Aaron’s staff buds, duties of the Levites

The first journey of the Israelites after the Tabernacle had been constructed is commenced. The people murmur against God and are punished by fire; Moses complains of the stubbornness of the Israelites and is ordered to choose seventy elders to assist him in the government of the people. Miriam and Aaron insult Moses at Hazeroth, which angers God; Miriam is punished with [[leprosy]] and is shut out of camp for seven days, at the end of which the Israelites proceed to the [[desert of Paran]]. [[The Twelve Spies|Twelve spies]] are sent out into Canaan and come back to report to Moses. [[Joshua]] and [[Caleb]], two of the spies, tell that the land is abundant and is &quot;flowing with milk and honey&quot;;  the other spies say that it is inhabited by giants, and the Israelites refuse to enter the land.  Yahweh decrees that the Israelites will be punished for their loss of [[faith]] by having to wander in the wilderness for 40 years.

Moses is ordered to make plates to cover the altar with the two hundred fifty censers left after the destruction of Korah's band. The children of Israel murmur against Moses and Aaron on account of the death of Korah's men and are stricken with the plague, with 14,700 perishing.

Aaron and his family are declared by God to be responsible for any iniquity committed in connection with the sanctuary. The Levites are again appointed to help in the keeping of the Tabernacle. The Levites are ordered to surrender to the priests a part of the tithes taken to them.

===Preparations for crossing the Jordan===
:''See also:''
: *''[[Chukat]], on Numbers 19-21: Red heifer, water from a rock, Miriam’s and Aaron’s deaths, victories, serpents
: *''[[Balak (parsha)|Balak]], on Numbers 22-25: Balaam's donkey and blessing
: *''[[Pinchas (parsha)|Pinchas]], on Numbers 25-29: Phinehas, second census, inheritance, Moses' successor, offerings and holidays
: *''[[Matot]], on Numbers 30-34: Vows, Midian, dividing booty, land for Reuben, Gad, and half of Manasseh
: *''[[Masei]], on Numbers 33-36: Stations of the Israelites’ journeys, instructions for conquest, cities for Levites

After Miriam's death at Kadesh Barnea, the Israelites blame Moses for the lack of water. Moses, ordered by God to speak to a rock, disobeys by striking it, and is punished by the announcement that he shall not enter Canaan. The King of Edom refuses permission to the Israelites to pass through his land. Aaron dies on Mount Hor. The Israelites are bitten by [[Fiery flying serpent|fiery serpent]]s for speaking against God and Moses. A [[Nehushtan|brazen serpent]] is made to ward off these serpents. 

The new census, taken just before the entry into the land of Canaan, gives the total number of males from twenty years and upward as 601,730, the number of the Levites from a month old and upward as 23,000. The land shall be divided by lot. The daughters of [[Zelophehad]], their father having no sons, share in the allotment. Moses is ordered to appoint [[Joshua]] as his successor.

Prescriptions for the observance of the feasts, and the offerings for different occasions are enumerated. The Israelites massacre the people of Midian population. The Reubenites and the Gadites request Moses to assign them the land east of the Jordan. After their promise to go before the army to help in the conquest of the land west of the Jordan, Moses grants their request. The land [[Transjordan (Bible)|east of the Jordan]] is divided among the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh.

The stations at which the Israelites halted during their forty years' wanderings in the wilderness are enumerated. While in the plains of Moab the Israelites are told that, after crossing the Jordan, they should exterminate the Canaanites and destroy their idols. The boundaries of the land are spelled out. The land is to be divided among the tribes under the superintendence of [[Eleazar]], Joshua, and twelve princes, one of each tribe.

==Composition==
Academic scholarship holds that the Pentateuch does not have a single author, and that its composition took place over centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com.au/books?id=Dkr7rVd3hAQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Reading+the+Pentateuch:+a+historical+introduction&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=_CKY8QJ8l4&amp;sig=rPUa2F-BYVi5EXdADcjdFPeWn9k&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=8h-oTLe9PMaXcamL5dIN&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=McDermott, John J., &quot;Reading the Pentateuch: a historical introduction&quot; (Pauline Press, 2002)p.21 |publisher=Books.google.com.au |date= |accessdate=2010-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the late 19th century there was a great deal of consensus among a certain school of scholars around the [[documentary hypothesis]], which speculates that the five books were created c.450 BCE by combining four originally independent sources, known as the [[Jahwist]], or J (about 900 BCE), the [[Elohist]], or E (about 800 BCE), the [[Deuteronomist]], or D, (about 600 BCE), and the [[Priestly source]], or P (about 500 BC).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/article_pentateuch_wenham.html Gordon Wenham, ''Pentateuchal Studies Today'', in Themelios 22.1 (October 1996): 3-13.]&lt;/ref&gt; This agreement began to break down in the late 1970s, and today there are many theories but no consensus, or even majority viewpoint.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com.au/books?id=T-Vi9eK_vS0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Pentateuch+Social+Science+Commentary&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=YFjyZ--lWF&amp;sig=TIRb_ehgMxbJgjPJTpNi45C3xnY&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=9CeoTPGfBM-rcYSGyOEN&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Van Seters, John, &quot;The Pentateuch: a social-science commentary&quot; T&amp;T Clark, 2004) p.74 |publisher=Books.google.com.au |date= |accessdate=2010-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Variations of the [[documentary hypothesis]] remain popular, especially in America and Israel, and the recognition of distinctive Deuteronomistic and Priestly &quot;theologies&quot; and vocabularies remains widespread, but they are used to form new approaches suggesting  that the books were combined gradually over time by the slow accumulation of &quot;fragments&quot; of text, or that a basic text was &quot;supplemented&quot; by later authors/editors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com.au/books?id=T-Vi9eK_vS0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Pentateuch+Social+Science+Commentary&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=YFjyZ--lWF&amp;sig=TIRb_ehgMxbJgjPJTpNi45C3xnY&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=9CeoTPGfBM-rcYSGyOEN&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Van Seters, John, &quot;The Pentateuch: a social-science commentary&quot; T&amp;T Clark, 2004) pp.74-79 |publisher=Books.google.com.au |date= |accessdate=2010-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

At the same time there has been a tendency to bring the origins of the Pentateuch further forward in time, and the most recent proposals place it in 5th century [[Yehud Medinata|Judah under the Persian empire]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com.au/books?id=7cdy67ZvzdkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Introduction+to+reading+the+Pentateuch+Jean+Louis+Ska&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NmEjPoTnT4&amp;sig=TfQu3f9e_Ctke36o7eX1_MNqL8Y&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=s7WlTN-pK8KycPT3jKcH&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Ska, Jean-Louis, &quot;Introduction to reading the Pentateuch&quot; (Eisenbrauns, 2006)] pp.217 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Tanakh OT}}

The '''Book of Judges''' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: ''Sefer Shoftim'' ספר שופטים) is the seventh book of the [[Hebrew bible]] and the Christian [[Old Testament]]. Its title describes to its contents: it contains the history of [[Biblical judges]], who helped rule and guide the ancient [[Israelites]].

The judges are divinely inspired prophet whose direct knowledge of Yahweh allows them to act as decision-makers for the [[Israelite]]s, as military deliverers from oppression for foreign rulers, and models of the proper behaviour required of them by their god, [[Yahweh]].&lt;ref&gt;Niditch, pp.2-3&lt;/ref&gt; The stories follow a consistent pattern: the people are unfaithful to Yahweh and he therefore delivers them into the hands of their enemies; the people then repent and entreat Yahweh for mercy, which he sends in the form of a judge; the judge delivers the Israelites from oppression, but after a while they fall into unfaithfulness again and the cycle is repeated.&lt;ref&gt;Soggin, p.4&lt;/ref&gt;

Judges forms part of [[Deuteronomistic history]], a theologically-oriented history of Israel from the entry into [[Canaan]] to the destruction of the Temple; the details of this history's composition are still widely debated, but most scholars place its origins, or at least its final form, in the 6th century BCE and the community of the [[Babylonian exile]].&lt;ref&gt;Knoppers (2000a), p.1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
{{Book of Judges}}
* ''See [http://www.biblegateway.com/cgi-bin/bible?language=english&amp;version=NIV&amp;passage=judges Book of Judges at Bible Gateway]''

Judges can be divided into three major sections: a double prologue (chapters 1:1-3:6), a main body (3:7-16:31), and a double epilogue (17-21).&lt;ref&gt;Guest, p.190&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prologue===
The book opens with the [[Israelite]]s in the land which God has promised to them but worshiping &quot;foreign gods&quot; instead of [[Yahweh]], the god of Israel, and with the [[Canaanites]] still present everywhere.&lt;ref&gt;Spieckermann, p.341&lt;/ref&gt; Chapters 1:1-2:5 are thus a confession of failure;&lt;/ref&gt; chapters 2:6-3:6 are a major summary and reflection from the Deuteronomists,&lt;ref&gt;McKenzie, p.14&lt;/ref&gt; setting out the overall formula which the stories in the main text will follow: Israel &quot;does evil in the eyes of Yahweh;&quot; the people are given into the hands of their enemies and cry out to Yahweh; Yahweh raises up a leader; the &quot;spirit of Yahweh&quot; comes upon the leader, the enemy is defeated, and peace is regained.&lt;ref&gt;Guest, p.190&lt;/ref&gt;

===Main text===
Next comes the main text ({{bibleverse-nb||Judges|3:11-16:31|HE}}), six stories each concerning a major judge and their struggles against the oppressive kings of surrounding nations, plus the story of Abimelech, an Israelite who oppresses his own people. (There are also brief glosses on &quot;minor&quot; judges, bringing the total number of judges to twelve, plus Abimelech and Barak). The cyclic pattern set out in the prologue is readily apparent at the beginning, but as the stories progress it begins to disintegrate, mirroring the disintegration of the world of the Israelites.&lt;ref&gt;Guest, p.190&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Othniel Ben Kenaz|Othniel]] (3:9-11) vs. Cushan-Rishathaim, King of [[Aram]]; Israel has 40 years peace until the death of Othniel. (The statement that Israel has a certain period of peace after each judge is a recurrent theme)
*[[Ehud]] (3:11-29) vs. [[Eglon (king)|Eglon]] of [[Moab]]
*[[Deborah]] the prophetess and [[Barak]] the army leader (4-5) vs. [[Jabin]] of [[Hazor]] (a city in [[Canaan]]) and [[Sisera]], his captain
*[[Gideon (Judges)|Gideon]] (6-8) vs. [[Midian]], [[Amalek]], and the &quot;children of the East&quot; (apparently desert tribes)
*[[Abimelech (Judges)|Abimelech]] (9) (who is traditionally counted as a king not a judge, and is considered evil) vs. all the Israelites who oppose him
*[[Jephthah]] (11-12:7) vs. the [[Ammon]]ites
*[[Samson]] (13-16) vs. the [[Philistines]]

===Epilogue===
The book concludes with two appendices ({{bibleverse-nb||Judges|17:1-21:25|HE}}), stories which do not feature a specific judge:&lt;ref&gt;Soggin, p.5&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Dan and the Idols of Micah]] ({{bibleverse-nb||Judges|17-18|HE}}), how the tribe of Dan conquers its territory in the north
*[[Battle of Gibeah|Gibeah and the Levite Concubine]] ({{bibleverse-nb||Judges|19-21|HE}}), a war between Benjamin and the other tribes.
By the end of Judges the Israelites are in a worse condition than they were at the beginning, with Yahweh's treasures used to make idolatrous images, the Levites (priests) corrupted, the tribe of Dan conquering a remote village instead of the Canaanite cities, and the tribes of Israel making war on the Benjaminites, their own brothers.&lt;ref&gt;Guest, pp.202-204&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition==
===The Deuteronomistic history===
Since the second half of the 20th century most scholars have agreed with [[Martin Noth]]'s thesis that the books of [[Deuteronomy]], [[Book of Joshua|Joshua]], Judges, [[Books of Samuel|Samuel]] and [[Books of Kings|Kings]] form parts of a single work.&lt;ref&gt;Knoppers (2000a), p.1&lt;/ref&gt; Noth maintained that the history was written in the early Exilic period (6th century BCE) in order to demonstrate how Israel's history was worked out in accordance with the theology expressed in the book of Deuteronomy (which thus provides the name &quot;Deuteronomistic&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;Walton, 169-170&lt;/ref&gt; Noth believed that this history was the work of a single author, living in the mid-6th century BCE, selecting, editing and composing from his sources to produce a coherent work.&lt;ref&gt;Knoppers (2000b), p.119&lt;/ref&gt; Frank Moore Cross later proposed that an early version of the history was composed in Jerusalem in Josiah's time (late 7th century); this first version, Dtr1, was then revised and expanded to create a second edition, that identified by Noth, and which Cross labelled Dtr2.&lt;ref&gt;Eynikel, pp.14ff.&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Sources===
The basic source for Judges was a collection of loosely connected stories about tribal heroes who saved the people in battle.&lt;ref&gt;Knight, p.67&lt;/ref&gt; This original &quot;book of saviours,&quot; made up of the stories of Ehud, Jael and parts of Gideon, had already been enlarged and transformed into &quot;wars of Yahweh&quot; before being given the final Deuteronomistic revision.&lt;ref&gt;Soggin, pp.5-6&lt;/ref&gt; In the 20th century the first part of the prologue (chapters 1:1-2:5) and the two parts of the epilogue (17-21) were commonly seen as miscellaneous collections of fragments tacked on to the main text, and the second part of the prologue (2:6-3:6) as an introduction composed expressly for the book; this view has been challenged in the latter decades of the century, and there is an increasing willingness to see Judges as the work of a single individual, working by carefully selecting, reworking and positioning his source material to introduce and conclude his themes.&lt;ref&gt;Guest, pp.201-202&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==
The essence of Deuteronomistic theology is that Israel has entered into a [[biblical covenant|covenant]] (a treaty, a binding agreement) with the god [[Yahweh]], under which they agree to accept Yahweh as their god (hence the phrase &quot;god of Israel&quot;) and Yahweh promises them a land where they can live in peace and prosperity. [[Book of Deuteronomy|Deuteronomy]] contains the laws by which Israel is to live in the promised land, [[Book of Joshua|Joshua]] chronicles the conquest of [[Canaan]], the promised land, and its allotment among the tribes, Judges describes the settlement of the land, [[Books of Samuel|Samuel]] the consolidation of the land and people under [[David]], and [[Books of Kings|Kings]] the destruction of kingship and loss of the land.&lt;ref&gt;Knight, p.61&lt;/ref&gt; The final tragedy described in Kings is the result of Israel's failure to uphold its part of the covenant: faithfulness to Yahweh brings success, economic, military and political, but unfaithfulness brings defeat and oppression.&lt;ref&gt;Niditch, p.11&lt;/ref&gt; This is the theme played out in Judges: the people are unfaithful to Yahweh and he therefore delivers them into the hands of their enemies; the people then repent and entreat Yahweh for mercy, which he sends in the form of a judge; the judge delivers the Israelites from oppression, but after a while they fall into unfaithfulness again and the cycle is repeated.&lt;ref&gt;Soggin, p.4&lt;/ref&gt;

Further themes are also present: the &quot;sovereign freedom of Yahweh&quot; (God does not always do what is expected of him); the &quot;satirisation of foreign kings&quot; (who consistently underestimate Israel and Yahweh); the concept of the &quot;flawed judge&quot; (judges who are not adequate to the task before them) and the disunity of the Israelite community (which gathers pace as the stories succeed one another).&lt;ref&gt;Guest, pp.194-&lt;/ref&gt;

The book is as intriguing for the themes it leaves out as for what it includes: the [[ark of the covenant]], which is given so much importance in the stories of [[Moses]] and [[Joshua]], is almost entirely missing, cooperation between the various tribes is limited, and there is no mention of a central shrine for worship or of a high priest (the office to which [[Aaron]] was appointed at the end of [[the Exodus]] story).&lt;ref&gt;Matthews, p.4&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Books of [[Samuel]]''' ({{lang-he|''Sefer Sh'muel'' ספר שמואל}}) in the Jewish bible are part of the [[Former Prophets]], ([[Book of Joshua|Joshua]], [[Book of Judges|Judges]], Samuel and [[Books of Kings|Kings]] - the sequence of books in the [[Old Testament]] is identical, with the addition of [[Book of Ruth|Ruth]]), a theological history of the [[Israelites]] affirming and explaining the [[Torah]] (God's law for Israel) under the guidance of the prophets.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, p.18&lt;/ref&gt; 

Samuel begins by telling how the prophet [[Samuel]] is chosen by [[Yahweh]], the god of the [[Israelites]], at his birth. The story of the [[Ark]] which follows tells of Israel's oppression by the [[Philistines]], which brings about Samuel's anointing of [[Saul]] as Israel's first king. But Saul proves unworthy and God's choice turns instead to [[David]], who defeats Israel's enemies and brings the Ark to Jerusalem. God then promises David and his successors an eternal dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;Spieckerman, p.348&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Jewish tradition the author was Samuel himself, but this idea is no longer regarded as tenable.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, p.196&lt;/ref&gt; Modern scholarly thinking is that it originated by combining a number of independent units, of various ages,&lt;ref&gt;Jones, p.197&lt;/ref&gt; when the larger [[Deuteronomistic history]] (the Former Prophets plus [[Deuteronomy]]) was being composed in the period c.630-540 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Knight (1995), p.62&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
[[File:Ernst Josephson. - David och Saul.JPG|thumb|right|300px|[[Ernst Josephson]], ''David and Saul'', 1878.]]
''See [http://www.biblegateway.com/quicksearch/?quicksearch=samuel&amp;qs_version=31 Book of Samuel] at Bible Gateway''

The childless [[Hannah (Bible)|Hannah]] vows to [[God of Israel|Yahweh]] that if she has a son, he will be dedicated to Yahweh. [[Eli (Bible)|Eli]], the priest of [[Shiloh]] (where the [[ark of the covenant]] is located), blesses her, and a child named [[Samuel (Bible)|Samuel]] is born. Eli's sons prove unworthy of the priesthood and are destroyed by God, but the child Samuel grows up &quot;in the presence of the Lord.&quot;

The Philistines capture the [[Ark of the Covenant]] from Shiloh and take it to the temple of their god [[Dagon]], who recognises the supremacy of Yahweh. The Philistines are afflicted with plagues and return the ark to the Israelites, but to the territory of the tribe of Benjamin rather than to Shiloh. The Philistines attack the Israelites gathered at [[Mizpah in Gilead (Judges)|Mizpah]] in Benjamin. Samuel appeals to Yahweh, the Philistines are decisively beaten, and the Israelites reclaim their lost territory. 

In Samuel's old age, he appoints his sons as judges, but they are unworthy, and so the people clamour for a king. God reluctantly accedes and gives them [[Saul]] of the tribe of Benjamin. Saul defeats the enemies of the Israelites, but commits sins against Yahweh.

Yahweh tells Samuel to anoint [[David]] of [[Bethlehem]] as king, and David enters Saul's court as his armour-bearer and harpist. Saul's son and heir Jonathan befriends David and recognises him as rightful king. Saul plots David's death, but David flees into the wilderness, where he becomes a champion of the Hebrews. David joins the Philistines, but continues secretly to champion his own people, until Saul and Jonathon are killed in battle.

The elders of Judah anoint David as king, but in the north Saul's son Ishbaal rules over the northern tribes. After a long war Ishbaal is murdered hoping for reward from David, but David has them killed for killing God's anointed. David is then anointed King of all Israel. David captures Jerusalem and brings the Ark there. David wishes to build a temple, but [[Nathan (Prophet)|Nathan]] tells him that one of David's sons will be the one to build the temple.David defeats the enemies of Israel, slaughtering Philistines, [[Moab]]ites, [[Edom]]ites, Syrians and [[Aram]]aeans. 

David commits adultery with Bathsheba and plots the death of her husband; for this God punishes him, saying that the sword shall never depart from his house. For the remainder of his reign there are problems: one of his sons rapes one of his daughters, another son kills the first, his favourite son rebels and is killed, until finally only two contenders for the succession remain, one of them Bathsheba's son [[Solomon]]. As David lies dying Bathsheba and Solomon plot Solomon's elevation to the throne.

===Textual history===
1 and 2 Samuel were originally a single book, but the first Greek translation, produced in the centuries immediately before Christ, divided it into two; this was adopted by the Latin translation used in the early Christian church of the West, and finally introduced into Jewish bibles around the early 16th century CE.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, pp.19-20&lt;/ref&gt; The Hebrew text differs considerably from the Greek, and modern scholars are still working at finding the best solutions to the many problems this presents.&lt;ref&gt;Bergen, pp.25-27&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Deuteronomistic history===
Although details remain disputed, the vast majority of recent studies agree with [[Martin Noth]]'s thesis, published in 1943, that the book of Samuel was composed as part of the [[Deuteronomistic history]], the books of [[Deuteronomy]], [[Book of Joshua|Joshua]], [[Book of Judges|Judges]], Samuel and [[Books of Kings|Kings]].&lt;ref&gt;Klein, p.317&lt;/ref&gt; Noth thought the History was composed by a single individual, but this idea has been more of less given up and modern scholars argue for multiple authors active over a considerable period, culminating in the mid-6th century.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, pp.316-317&lt;/ref&gt; Further editing was apparently done even after that - the silver quarter-shekel which Saul's servant offers to Samuel in 1 Samuel 9 almost certainly fixes the date of this story in the Persian or Hellenistic periods.&lt;ref&gt;Auld, p.219&lt;/ref&gt;

The 6th century authors/editors drew on earlier sources, including (but not limited to) an &quot;ark narrative&quot; (1 Samuel 4:1-7:1 and part of 2 Samuel 6), a &quot;Saul cycle&quot; (parts of 1 Samuel 9-11 and 13-14), the &quot;history of David's rise&quot; (1 Samuel 16:14-2 Samuel 5:10), and the &quot;succession narrative&quot; (2 Samuel 9-20 and 1 Kings 1-2).&lt;ref&gt;Knight (1991), p.853&lt;/ref&gt; The sources used to construct 1 &amp; 2 Samuel are:&lt;ref&gt;Jones, pp.197-199&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Call of Samuel'' or ''Youth of Samuel'' (1 Samuel 1-7): From Samuel's birth his career as Judge and prophet over Israel. This source includes the ''Eli narrative'' and part of the ark narrative.&lt;ref&gt;Soggin, pp.210-211&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Ark narrative''  (1 Samuel 4:1b-7:1 and 2 Samuel 6:1-20): the ark's capture by the Philistines in the time of Eli and its transfer to Jerusalem by David - opinion is divided over whether this is actually an independent unit.&lt;ref&gt;Eynikel, p.88&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Jerusalem source'': a fairly brief source discussing David conquering Jerusalem from the Jebusites.
*''Republican source'': a source with an anti-monarchial bias. This source first describes Samuel as decisively ridding the people of the Philistines, and begrudgingly appointing an individual chosen by God to be king, namely Saul. David is described as someone renowned for his skill at playing the harp, and consequently summoned to Saul's court to calm his moods. Saul's son Jonathan becomes friends with David, which [[David and Jonathan|some commentators view as romantic]], and later acts as his protector against Saul's more violent intentions. At a later point, having been deserted by God on the eve of battle, Saul consults a [[Mediumship|medium]] at Endor, only to be condemned for doing so by Samuel's ghost, and told he and his sons will be killed. David is heartbroken on discovering the death of Jonathan, tearing his clothes apart.
*''Monarchial source'': a source with a pro-monarchial bias and covering many of the same details as the ''republican source''. This source begins with the divinely appointed birth of Samuel. It then describes Saul as leading a war against the Ammonites, being chosen by the people to be king, and leading them against the Philistines. David is described as a shepherd boy arriving at the battlefield to aid his brothers, and is overheard by Saul, leading to David challenging Goliath and defeating the Philistines. David's warrior credentials lead to women falling in love with him, including Michal, Saul's daughter, who later acts to protect David against Saul. David eventually gains two new wives as a result of threatening to raid a village, and Michal is redistributed to another husband. At a later point, David finds himself seeking sanctuary amongst the Philistine army and facing the Israelites as an enemy. David is incensed that anyone should have killed Saul, even as an act of mercy, since Saul was anointed by Samuel, and has the individual responsible killed.
*''[[Court History of David]]'' or ''Succession narrative'' (2 Samuel 9-20 and 1 Kings 1-2): a &quot;historical novel&quot;, in [[Alberto Soggin]]'s phrase, telling the story of David's reign from his affair with [[Bathsheba]] to his death. The theme is of retribution: David's sin against [[Uriah the Hittite]] is punished by God through the destruction of his own family,&lt;ref&gt;Soggin, pp.216-217&lt;/ref&gt; and its purpose is to serve as an apology for the coronation of Bathsheba's son [[Solomon]] instead of his older brother [[Adonijah]].&lt;ref&gt;Klein, p.316&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Redactions'': additions by the redactor to harmonise the sources together; many of the uncertain passages may be part of this editing.
*''Various'': several short sources, none of which have much connection to each other, and are fairly independent of the rest of the text. Many are poems or pure lists.
The Hebrew text of Samuel is widely recognised to be heavily corrupted with errors (meaning that scribes, over the centuries, have introduced many mistakes while copying the original version), while in addition the Greek and Hebrew versions differ considerably; modern scholars are still working at finding the best solutions to the many problems this presents.

==Themes and genre==
[[File:Hannah VICTORS, Jan.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Hannah]] presenting [[Samuel (Biblical figure)|Samuel]] to [[Eli (Bible)|Eli]], by [[Jan Victors]], 1645.]]
While normally classified as history, the Book of Samuel is a theological evaluation of kingship in general and of dynastic kingship and [[David]] in particular.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, p.312&lt;/ref&gt; The main themes of the book as introduced in the opening poem (the &quot;[[Song of Hannah]]&quot;) are: (1), the sovereignty of [[Yahweh]], the god of Israel; (2), the reversal of human fortunes; and (3), kingship.&lt;ref&gt;Tsumura, p.68&lt;/ref&gt; These themes are played out in the stories of the three main characters, [[Samuel]], [[Saul]] and [[David]].

===Samuel===
Samuel answers the description of the &quot;prophet like Moses&quot; predicted in Deuteronomy 18:15-22: like Moses, he has direct contact with [[Yahweh]], the god of the [[Israelites]], acts as a judge, and is a perfect leader who never makes mistakes.&lt;ref&gt;Beytenbrach, pp.53-55&lt;/ref&gt; Samuel's successful defence of the Israelites against their enemies demonstrates that they have no need for a king (who will, moreover, introduce inequality), yet despite this the people demand a king. But the king they are given is Yahweh's gift, and Samuel explains that kingship can be a blessing rather than a curse if they remain faithful to their god. On the other hand, total destruction of both king and people will result if they turn to wickedness.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, p.317&lt;/ref&gt;

===Saul===
Saul is the chosen one, a king appointed by Yahweh the god of Israel and anointed by Samuel, Yahweh's prophet, and yet he is ultimately rejected.&lt;ref&gt;Hertzberg, p.19&lt;/ref&gt; Saul loses the chance to establish his dynasty and even to continue to reign through two faults: he carries out a sacrifice in place of Samuel (1 Samuel 13:8-14), and he fails to carry out genocide as God has ordered (1 Samuel 15).&lt;ref&gt;Klein, p.319&lt;/ref&gt; The Deuteronomist's negative view of Saul and desire to show David as the first real king of Israel has obscured Saul's real achievements.&lt;ref&gt;Schleffer, p.263&lt;/ref&gt;

===David===
One of the main units within Samuel is the &quot;History of David's Rise&quot;, the purpose of which is to justify David as the legitimate successor to Saul.&lt;ref&gt;Dick, pp.3-4&lt;/ref&gt; The narrative stresses that he gained the throne lawfully, always respecting &quot;the Lord's anointed&quot; (i.e. Saul) and never taking any of his numerous chances to seize the throne by violence.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, p.198&lt;/ref&gt; As God's chosen king over Israel David is also the son of God (&quot;I will be a father to him, and he shall be a son to me...&quot; - 2 Samuel 7:14).&lt;ref&gt;Coogan, pp.216, 229-33.&lt;/ref&gt; God enters into an eternal covenant (treaty) with David and his line, promising divine protection of the dynasty and of Jerusalem through all time.&lt;ref&gt;Coogan, p.425&lt;/ref&gt; The story can be compared to that of a 13th century Hittite king who was forced to take the throne after a lifetime of loyalty when his life was in danger: like David, he was assisted by his god, whose divine will decided the course of events.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, p.198&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Book of Revelation''' is the final book of the [[New Testament]] corpus.  The title came into usage from the first word of the book in [[Koine Greek]]: ''apokalupsis'', meaning &quot;unveiling&quot; or &quot;revelation&quot; (the author himself not having provided a title). It is also known as the '''Book of Revelation of St John the Divine''' or the '''Apocalypse of John''', (both in reference to its author) or the '''Book of Revelation of Jesus Christ''' (in reference to its opening line) or simply '''Revelation''', (often dubbed &quot;Revelations&quot; in contrast to the singular in the original [[Koine]]) or the '''Apocalypse'''.  The word &quot;[[apocalypse]]&quot; is also used for other works of a similar nature, and the genre is known as [[apocalyptic literature]]. Such literature is &quot;marked by distinctive literary features, particularly prediction of future events and accounts of visionary experiences or journeys to heaven, often involving vivid symbolism.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Walter A. Elwell, ed. &quot;Apocalyptic.&quot; ''Evangelical Dictionary of Biblical Theology.'' Grand Rapids, MI: Baker, 1996. Page 28.&lt;/ref&gt;
The Book of Revelation is the only apocalyptic document in the New Testament [[Biblical canon|canon]], though there are short apocalyptic passages in various places in the Gospels and the Epistles.&lt;ref&gt;Other apocalypses popular in the [[early Christian]] era did not achieve canonical status, except [[2 Esdras]] (also known as the Apocalypse of Ezra), which is recognized as canonical in the [[Ethiopian Orthodox]] Churches.&lt;/ref&gt;

Revelation brings together the worlds of [[heaven]], [[earth]], and [[hell]] in a final confrontation between the forces of good and evil. Its characters and images are both real and symbolic, spiritual and material. Revelation's cryptic nature makes the book a source of controversy among scholars who try to interpret its meaning and its message. Nevertheless, it has not only endured, but captured the imagination of generations of Bible students, both professional and lay readers alike. The author, named John, has traditionally been identified with [[John the Apostle]], to whom the Gospel of John is also attributed. Historical-critical scholars, however, conclude that the author did not also write the Gospel of John.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bart D. Ehrman]] wrote that &quot;it can be stated without reservation that whoever wrote the Gospel did not write this book.&quot; Ehrman 2004, p. 467ff&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Fourth Gospel 1985 p. 355&quot;&gt;&quot;Although ancient traditions attributed to the Apostle John the Fourth Gospel, the Book of Revelation, and the three Epistles of John, modern scholars believe that he wrote none of them.&quot; [[Stephen L Harris|Harris, Stephen L.]], ''Understanding the Bible'' (Palo Alto: Mayfield, 1985) p. 355&lt;/ref&gt; Most scholars think that Revelation was written near the end of the 1st century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Books.google.com&quot;&gt;Robert Mounce. The Book of Revelation, pg. 15-16. Cambridge: Eerdman's. [http://books.google.com/books?id=6FAookts4MUC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_v2_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Books.google.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods of Interpretation==
Most of the interpretations fall into one or more of the following categories:
:[[Historicism|Historicist]], which sees in Revelation a broad view of history;
:[[Preterist]], in which Revelation mostly refers to the events of the [[apostolic era]] (1st century);
:[[Futurism (Christianity)|Futurist]], which believes that Revelation describes future events; and
:[[Idealism (Christian eschatology)|Idealist]], or ''Symbolic'', which holds that Revelation does not refer to actual people or events, but is an [[allegory]] of the spiritual path and the ongoing struggle between [[good and evil]].

These approaches are by no means mutually exclusive, and are often used in combination with each other to form a more complete and coherent interpretation.

==Authorship==

{{Main|Authorship of the Johannine works}}
[[Image:BritLibAddMS35166ApocalypseFolio003rAngelApeardToJohn.jpg|thumb|300px|The Angel Appears to John. The book of Revelation. 13th century manuscript. [[British Library]], [[London]].]]
The author of Revelation identifies himself several times as &quot;John&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Rev. 1:1, 4, 9; 22:8&lt;/ref&gt; The author also states that he was on [[Patmos]] when he received his first vision.&lt;ref&gt;Rev 1:9; 4:1-2&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the author of Revelation is sometimes referred to as [[John of Patmos]].

===Early views===

[[Justin Martyr]] (c. 100-165 AD) who was acquainted with [[Polycarp]], who had been mentored by John, makes a possible allusion to this book, and credits John as the source.&lt;ref&gt;St. Justin Martyr, ''[[Dialogue with Trypho]]'' Chapter lxxxi.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Irenaeus]] (c. 115-202) assumes it as a conceded point. At the end of the 2nd century, it is accepted at [[Antioch]] by Theophilus (died c. 183), and in Africa by [[Tertullian]] (c. 160-220). At the beginning of the 3rd century, it is adopted by [[Clement of Alexandria]] and by [[Origen of Alexandria]], later by [[Methodius]], Cyprian, Lactantius,{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} [[Dionysius of Alexandria]],&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius of Caesarea, ''Ecclesiastical History'' Book vii. Chapter xxv.&lt;/ref&gt; and in the 5th century by [[Quodvultdeus]].&lt;ref&gt;St. Quodvultdeus, On the Symbol, 3.1-6&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eusebius]] (c. 263–339) was inclined to class the Apocalypse with the accepted books but also listed it in the [[Antilegomena]].&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius of Caesarea, ''Ecclesiastical History'' Book iii. Chapter xxv.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jerome]] (347-420) relegated it to second class.&lt;ref&gt;Jerome's Homily on Psalm 149&lt;/ref&gt; Most canons included it, but some in the Eastern Church rejected it. It is not included in the [[Peshitta]] (an early New Testament in Aramaic).&lt;ref name=EB&gt;&quot;Apocalypse&quot;, ''[[Encyclopedia Biblica]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Traditional view===

The traditional view holds that [[John the Apostle]]&amp;mdash;considered to have written the [[Gospel of John|Gospel]] and the [[epistles of John]]&amp;mdash;was exiled on Patmos in the Aegean archipelago during the reign of [[Domitian]], and there wrote Revelation. Those in favour of apostolic authorship point to the testimony of the early church fathers (see &quot;Early Views&quot; above) and similarities between the ''Gospel of John'' and ''Revelation''. For example, both works are [[soteriological]] and possess a high [[Christology]], stressing Jesus' divine side as opposed to the human side stressed by the [[Synoptic Gospels]]. In the Gospel of John and in Revelation, Jesus is referred to as &quot;the Word of God&quot; ({{polytonic|Ὁ λόγος τοῦ Θεοῦ}}), although the context in Revelation is very different from John. The Word in Rev 19:13 is involved in judgement but in John 1:1, the image is used to speak of a role in creation and redemption.&lt;ref&gt;Revelation By [[Ben Witherington III]], p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charles Erdman]] (1866–1960) advocated apostolic authorship and wrote that only the Apostle John fits the image of the author derived from the text&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The author calls himself John, both in the opening and the closing verses of the book. He states that because of his Christian faith he has been banished to the isle of Patmos. He addresses the churches of Asia with a consciousness of unquestioned authority. Of no other person in the first century could these statements be made.&quot; Charles R. Erdman. ''Revelation of John: An Exposition.'' Westminster, 1936.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern views===

More recent methods of scholarship, such as [[textual criticism]], have been influential in suggesting that [[John the Apostle]], [[John the Evangelist]] and [[John of Patmos]] were three separate individuals. Differences in style, theological content, and familiarity with Greek between the Gospel of John, the epistles of John, and the Revelation are seen by some scholars as indicating three separate authors.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrman 2004, p. 467ff&lt;/ref&gt;

The English Biblical scholar, [[Robert Henry Charles]] (1855–1931), reasoned on internal textual grounds that the book was edited by someone who spoke no Hebrew and who wished to promote a different theology to John's. As a result, everything after 20:3, he claims, has been left in a haphazard state with no attempt to structure it logically. Furthermore, he says, the story of the defeat of the ten kingdoms has been deleted and replaced by 19:9-10.&lt;ref&gt;Charles ''Revelation'' p. xxviii&lt;/ref&gt; John's theology of chastity has been replaced by the editor's theology of outright celibacy, which makes little sense when John's true church is symbolised as a bride of the Lamb. Most importantly, the editor has completely rewritten John's theology of the Millennium which is &quot;emptied of all significance&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Charles ''Revelation'' p. liv&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John A. T. Robinson|John Robinson]] in &quot;Redating the New Testament&quot; (1976) has heavily criticised Charles' position and accepted apostolic authorship, dating John's Gospel before the [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|Siege of Jerusalem]] in 70 AD. He also argues that John's &quot;poor&quot; Greek is a literary device since Galileans were known to have excellent Greek.&lt;ref&gt;J.N.Sevenster, ''Do you know Greek?'', 1968.&lt;/ref&gt; He says: &quot;The Greek of the Apocalypse is not that of a beginner whose grammar and vocabulary might improve and mature into those of the evangelist.  It is the pidgin Greek of someone who appears to know exactly what he is about [to say]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;J.N.Sevenster, ''Do you know Greek?'', 1968. ch. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been contended that the core verses of the book, in general chapters 4 through 22, are surviving records of the prophecies of [[John the Baptist]].&lt;ref&gt;Ford, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;  In this view, the [[Lamb of God]] references and other hallmarks of Revelation are linked to what is known of John the Baptist, though it must be confessed that little information about him is known.

Harris|Understanding the Bible}}

===Dating===
According to early tradition, this book was composed near the end of [[Domitian|Domitian's]] reign, around the year 95 AD. Others contend for an earlier date, 68 or 69 AD, in the reign of [[Nero]] or shortly thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kenneth Gentry]]. ''Before Jerusalem Fell'', ISBN 0-930464-20-6. Powder Springs, Georgia: American Vision, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of modern scholars accept one of these two dates, with most accepting the Domitianic one.&lt;ref name=&quot;Books.google.com&quot;/&gt;

Those who favour the later date appeal to the earliest external testimony, that of the Christian father Irenaeus (c. 150-202),&lt;ref&gt;St. Irenaeus, ''Against Heresies'', Book 5 Chapter 30 Section 3.&lt;/ref&gt; who wrote that he received his information from people who knew John personally. Domitian, according to [[Eusebius of Caesarea]] (c. 263–339), started the [[Persecution of Christians|persecution]] referred to in the book. While some recent scholars have questioned the existence of a large-scale Domitian persecution,&lt;ref&gt;Brown 1997, pp.&amp;nbsp;806–809&lt;/ref&gt; others believe that Domitian's insistence on being treated as a god may have been a source of friction between the Church and Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Cary, E. (trans.) &quot;Dio Cassius' ''Roman History'', Epitome of Book LXI-LXX.&quot; ''Loeb Classical Library.'' Cambridge MA: [[Harvard University]], 1995. p.349.&lt;/ref&gt;

The earlier date, first proposed in modern times by [[John A. T. Robinson|John Robinson]] in a closely argued chapter of &quot;Redating the New Testament&quot; (1976),  relies on the book's internal evidence, given that no external testimony exists earlier than that of Irenaeus, noted above, and the earliest extant manuscript evidence of Revelation [[Papyrus 98|(P98)]] is likewise dated no earlier than the late 2nd century. This early dating is centered on the preterist interpretation of chapter 17, where the seven heads of the &quot;beast&quot; are regarded as the succession of Roman emperors up to the time of the fall of Jerusalem in 70 AD.&lt;ref&gt;Mounce, pg.19-21&lt;/ref&gt;

John W. Marshall dates the book to 69 or early 70 AD, saying it predates any [[Split of early Christianity and Judaism|formal separation of Christianity and Judaism]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Barr2006&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=David L. Barr|title=The reality of Apocalypse: rhetoric and politics in the book of Revelation|url=http://books.google.com/?id=zHLZob88C44C&amp;pg=PA153|accessdate=31 July 2010|date=July 2006|publisher=Society of Biblical Lit|isbn=9781589832183|pages=153–}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that it is a thoroughly Jewish text.&lt;ref name=&quot;MarshallReligion2001&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=John William Marshall|author2=Canadian Corporation for Studies in Religion|title=Parables of war: reading John's Jewish Apocalypse|url=http://books.google.com/?id=aKJ5ZJSZrAQC&amp;pg=PA2|accessdate=31 July 2010|date=19 November 2001|publisher=Wilfrid Laurier Univ. Press|isbn=9780889203747|pages=2–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some interpreters attempt to reconcile the two dates by placing the visions themselves at the earlier date (during the 60s) and the publication of Revelation under Domitian, who reigned in the 90s when Irenaeus says the book was written.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Paul Touilleux, Albert Gelin, André Feuillet&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canonical history===
''Revelation'' was accepted into the canon at the [[Council of Carthage]] of 397 AD.&lt;ref&gt;Denzinger [http://catho.org/9.php?d=bxk#a4r 186] in the new numbering, [http://www.catecheticsonline.com/SourcesofDogma1.php 92] in the old&lt;/ref&gt; Revelation's place in the canon was not guaranteed, however, with doubts raised as far back as the 2nd century about its character, symbolism, and apostolic authorship.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Pattemore, &quot;The People of God in the Apocalypse,&quot; (Cambridge University Press, 2004), p.1&lt;/ref&gt;

2nd century Christians in [[Syria]] rejected it because [[Montanism]], a sect which was deemed to be heretical by the mainstream church, relied heavily on it.&lt;ref&gt;see N. B. Stonehouse, Apocalypse in the Ancient Church, (c. 1929), pp. 139–142, esp. p. 138&lt;/ref&gt; In the 4th century, [[Gregory of Nazianzus]] and other [[bishop]]s argued against including Revelation because of the difficulties of interpreting it and the risk of abuse. In the 16th century, [[Martin Luther]] initially considered it to be &quot;neither apostolic nor prophetic&quot; and stated that &quot;Christ is neither taught nor known in it&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bible-researcher.com/antilegomena.html Luther's Treatment of the 'Disputed Books' of the New Testament]&lt;/ref&gt; and placed it in [[Antilegomena#Reformation|his Antilegomena]], i.e. his list of questionable documents, though he did retract this view in later life.  In the same century, [[John Calvin]] believed the book to be canonical, yet it was the only New Testament book on which he did not write a commentary.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony A. Hoekema, ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=c2yT_7xw35sC&amp;pg=PA297&amp;dq=calvin+%22book+of+revelation%22&amp;sig=AmfrifDlGtS92J3RYA22eIK-Fqs The Bible and the future],'' P.297. ISBN 0-8028-3516-3 ISBN 978-0-8028-3516-1, Grand Rapids, Mich.: Eerdmans, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; It remains the only book of the New Testament that is not read within the [[Divine Liturgy]] of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], though it is included in Catholic and Protestant liturgies.

According to [[Merrill Unger]] and Gary N. Larson, in spite of the objections that have been raised over the years, Revelation provides a logical conclusion, not just to the New Testament, but to the Christian Bible as a whole, and there is a continuous tradition dating back to the 2nd century which supports the authenticity of the document, and which indicates that it was generally included within the, as yet unformalized, canon of the early church.&lt;ref&gt;Merrill Unger and Gary Larson. &quot;Revelation.&quot; ''The New Unger's Bible Handbook.'' Chicago: Moody, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary elements==
A number of literary elements can be identified in Revelation, such as structure, plot, major characters, and unifying themes.

===Introduction===
[[File:Jesus at the Door.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The Jesus at the Door stained glass window depiction of Revelation 3:20 at [[St. Matthew's German Evangelical Lutheran Church]] in Charleston, South Carolina. Window attributed to the Quaker City Glass Company 1912.]]
The introduction identifies the addressees: “John, to the [[seven churches]] which are in [[Asia (Roman province)|Asia]]&quot;&lt;sup&gt;[1:4]&lt;/sup&gt; (&quot;Asia&quot; was a Roman province in what is now western Turkey). It describes in greater detail the circumstances in which the prophecy was received: “I, John, both your brother and companion in tribulation... was on the island that is called Patmos for the word of God and for the testimony of Jesus Christ.”&lt;sup&gt;[1:9]&lt;/sup&gt; Adela Collins, a theologian at the University of Notre Dame, writes:
:Early tradition says that John was banished to Patmos by the Roman authorities. This tradition is credible because banishment was a common punishment used during the Imperial period for a number of offenses. Among such offenses were the practices of magic and astrology. Prophecy was viewed by the Romans as belonging to the same category, whether Pagan, Jewish, or Christian. Prophecy with political implications, like that expressed by John in the book of Revelation, would have been perceived as a threat to Roman political power and order. Three of the islands in the Sporades were places where political offenders were banished (Pliny ''Natural History'' 4.69-70; Tacitus ''Annals'' 4.30).&lt;ref&gt;Adela Collins. &quot;Patmos.&quot; ''Harper's Bible Dictionary.'' Paul J. Achtemeier, gen. ed. San Francisco: Harper &amp; Row, 1985. p755.&lt;/ref&gt;

John's exile to Patmos, together with the phrase, &quot;your brother and companion in tribulation,&quot; implies a time of persecution. This is further indicated by the mention of a martyrdom in Pergamos&lt;sup&gt;[2:13]&lt;/sup&gt; and other passages in the messages to the churches.&lt;sup&gt;[cf. 2:3; 2:9-10]&lt;/sup&gt;

The introduction also describes the one from whom the prophecy was received:
:I turned around to see the voice that was speaking to me. And when I turned I saw seven golden lampstands, and among the lampstands was someone like a son of man, dressed in a robe reaching down to his feet and with a golden sash around his chest. His head and hair were white like wool, as white as snow, and his eyes were like blazing fire. His feet were like bronze glowing in a furnace, and his voice was like the sound of rushing waters. In his right hand he held seven stars, and out of his mouth came a sharp double-edged sword. His face was like the sun shining in all its brilliance.&lt;sup&gt;[1:12-16 niv]&lt;/sup&gt;

This person identifies himself to John with these words: “I am he who lives, and was dead, and behold, I am alive forevermore. And I have the keys of Hades and of Death.”&lt;sup&gt;[1:18]&lt;/sup&gt; After reassuring John that he need not be afraid, he gives John his commission: “Write the things which you have seen, and the things which are, and the things which will take place after this.”&lt;sup&gt;[1:19]&lt;/sup&gt; In the ''New Bible Commentary'', G.R. Beasley-Murray writes:
:&quot;What you have seen&quot; is the vision just given; &quot;what is now&quot; relates to the existing state of the churches and the letters about to be given; &quot;what will be hereafter&quot; is the subsequent visions of the book. This should not be pressed to imply that everything without exception in chs. 4-22 refers to the time future to John, let alone to the time of the end of all things.&lt;ref&gt;D.Guthrie, J.A.Motyer, A.M.Stibbs, D.J.Wiseman, eds. ''New Bible Commentary.'' 3rd ed. Grand Rapids: Wm. B. Eerdman's, 1970. p.1282.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Structure===
In terms of structure, the book is built around four successive groups of seven: the messages to the seven churches, the seven seal judgments, the seven trumpet judgments, and finally, the seven bowl judgments. There are also introductory and concluding passages, and additional passages which are inserted between the main structural elements in various places throughout the book (see ''Outline'', below).

The repeated occurrence of the number seven contributes to the overall unity of Revelation. While several numbers stand out—3, 4, 7, 10, 12, 24, 144, 1000—seven appears to have a special significance.  There are seven churches symbolized by seven lampstands (1:20); the churches have seven angels symbolized by seven stars (1:20); there are seven spirits before the throne of God, symbolized by seven lamps (4:5), and also by seven horns and seven eyes (5:6); the judgment scroll has seven seals (5:1) with a corresponding set of seven &quot;seal judgments&quot;; the seventh seal unleashes seven &quot;trumpet judgments,&quot; which are heralded by seven angels (8:1-2); the seventh trumpet unleashes seven &quot;bowl judgments,&quot; where the bowls of God's wrath are poured out by seven angels (15:1); there are seven mysterious thunders about which John is not permitted to say anything (10:3); 7,000 people are killed in an earthquake (11:13); the dragon has seven heads and seven diadems on his heads (12:3); and the beast from the sea has seven heads (13:1).

One half of seven, 3½, is also a conspicuous number in Revelation: two witnesses are given power to prophesy 1,260 days, or exactly 3½ years, according to the Hebrew year of 360 days (11:3); the witnesses are then killed, and their dead bodies lie in the streets of Jerusalem for 3½ days (11:9); the &quot;woman clothed with the sun&quot; is protected in the wilderness for 1,260 days, or 3½ years (12:6); Gentiles tread the holy city underfoot for 42 months, or 3½ years (11:2); and the beast is given authority to continue for 42 months, or 3½ years (13:5).

{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2010}}
A plot, or general storyline, can be identified in Revelation. The story proper is included in chapters 4-22, but chapters 1-3 lay the groundwork. These first three chapters consist of a brief introduction followed by seven separate messages conveyed by the author to seven churches. The larger themes of the book as a whole – judgment, salvation, the coming of the Messiah, etc. – are exposed in these messages, each of which is tailor-made for the church in question. Each message assesses how that particular church is doing, and tells it what changes, if any, need to be made. In a nutshell, the churches are each presented with a choice: to be faithful or not to be faithful. The potential consequences of their choices are graphically illustrated in the story proper, in chapters 4-22. The messages to the churches also serve as a device to convey a message to a wider audience, for each church's message ends with: &quot;He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches&quot; (2:7, etc.).

The plot of the story proper (ch. 4-22) is driven by a powerful conflict between the forces, both earthly and spiritual, of good and evil. Expressed in the simplest terms (for a more detailed outline, see below), it is as follows:

#There is a time of great [[tribulation]] on the Earth which combines [[natural disasters]] with [[war]] on an unprecedented scale;
#The &quot;Lamb&quot; saves his people from the tribulation, destroys the wicked, and ushers in an age of peace; after the age of peace, there is a second, brief time of trouble which results in the permanent banishment of the wicked;
#A new heaven and a new earth replace the old, and the people of God go to live in the presence of God and Christ in a heavenly city described as the &quot;[[New Jerusalem]].&quot; (See ''Interpretations'', below, for different understandings of these details. This section is only concerned with the text itself.)

===Characters===
Revelation has a variety of richly-drawn characters, including the Lamb, the Dragon, the [[archangel Michael]] and a number of other [[angel]]s, the Beast from the Land, the Beast from the Sea, the [[Whore of Babylon]], the four beasts around the [[Throne of God]], the [[four horsemen of the Apocalypse]], the two witnesses, the woman clothed with the sun, and the narrator (John). Some of these characters may be actual persons (whether on the spiritual or the physical plane), while others may be representative of a larger idea, rather than a personality as such.

The protagonist, known throughout most of the book as the &quot;Lamb,&quot; is a hero of magnificent proportions. This figure represents Jesus Christ, who is also identified as the [[Lamb of God]] in the [[Gospel of John]].

Almost as impressive{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} as the Lamb is the antagonist, [[Satan]], an archvillain known as the &quot;[[dragon]].&quot; In the end, the dragon, the Beast, and the False Prophet are thrown into a [[lake of fire]].

A beast with seven heads and ten horns is associated with the number 666. Another beast, looking like a lamb but speaking like a dragon, is identified as the False Prophet. He leads people to worship the first beast. Preterists (see ''Methods of Interpretation'', above) commonly identify the beast with the Roman Emperor [[Nero]], because his name equals [[666 (number)|666]] in Hebrew,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Catholic Encyclopedia|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01594b.htm|title=Apocalypse|accessdate=2007-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; if using the Greek spelling of Nero's name (Neron Caesar), but using the Hebrew symbols with their assigned numeric values (an ancient method known as [[gematria]]). However, a few ancient manuscripts of the Revelation say the number is 616, fifty less than the more well known numeral. A possible method to this problem lies in early translation. In the assumption that the Revelation was meant to be distributed among the [[Early Christians]], it could very well be assumed that occasionally someone may have used the Latin spelling of Nero's name (Nero Caesar), so the total value of the gematria would be 616.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/~grout/encyclopaedia_romana/gladiators/nero.html|title=Nero as the Antichrist|publisher= Encyclopaedia Romana|author=Grout, James|accessdate=2008-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Hank Hanegraaff|Hanegraaff, Hank]]. 2007. ''The Apocalypse Code'' (ISBN 0-8499-0184-7) Nashville, Tennessee: Thomas Nelson, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

The great harlot Babylon is associated with the Beast and refers to a counterfeit &quot;bride&quot; to the church.

The four horsemen of the Apocalypse appear when Jesus Christ opens the first four of the seven seals. They ride white, red, black, and pale-green horses. They symbolize conquest, war, famine, and death (or pestilence), respectively.

==Interpretations==
{{Christian Eschatology}}
''Revelation'' has a wide variety of interpretations, ranging from the simple message that we should have faith that God will prevail (''symbolic interpretation''), to complex end time scenarios (''futurist interpretation''),&lt;ref&gt;Robert J. Karris (ed.) The Collegeville Bible Commentary Liturgical Press, 1992 p. 1296.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ken Bowers, Hiding in plain sight, Cedar Fort, 2000 p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt; to the views of critics who deny any spiritual value to Revelation at all.&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl Gustav Jung]] in his autobiography ''Memories Dream Reflections'' said &quot;I will not discuss the transparent prophecies of the Book of Revelation because no one believes in them and the whole subject is felt to be an embarrassing one.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early Christian era,{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} Christians generally understood the book to predict future events, especially an upcoming millennium of paradise on earth. In the late classical and medieval eras, the Church disavowed the millennium as a literal thousand-year kingdom. With the Protestant Reformation, opponents of Roman Catholicism adopted a historicist view, in which the predicted apocalypse is believed to be playing out in church history. A Jesuit scholar countered with preterism, the belief that Revelation predicted events that actually occurred as predicted in the 1st century. In the 19th century, futurism (belief that the predictions refer to future events) largely replaced historicism among conservative Protestants.

===Religious views===
====Futurist view====
{{Main|Futurism (Christian eschatology)}}
The futurist view assigns all or most of the prophecy to the future, shortly before the [[second coming]]; especially when interpreted in conjunction with [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]], [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] 2:11-22, [[1 Thessalonians]] 4:15–5:11, and other [[Eschatology|eschatological]] sections of the Bible.

Futurist interpretations generally predict a [[resurrection of the dead]] and a [[rapture]] of the living, wherein all true Christians and those who have not reached an [[age of accountability]] are gathered to Christ at the time [[Kingdom of God|God's kingdom]] comes on earth. They also believe a [[tribulation]] will occur - a seven year period of time when believers will experience worldwide persecution and martyrdom, and be purified and strengthened by it. Futurists differ on when believers will be raptured, but there are three primary views: 1) before the tribulation; 2) near or at the midpoint of the tribulation; or 3) at the end of the tribulation. There is also a fourth view of multiple raptures throughout the tribulation, but this view does not have a mainstream following.

[[Dispensationalism|Pretribulationists]] believe that all Christians then alive will be taken up to meet Christ before the Tribulation begins. In this manner, Christians are &quot;kept from&quot; the Tribulation, such as Enoch was removed before God judged the antediluvian world, in contrast with Noah who was &quot;kept through&quot; wrath and judgement of God in the flood of Genesis.

[[Middle Tribulation Rapture|Midtribulationists]] believe that the rapture of the faithful will occur approximately halfway through the Tribulation, after it begins but before the worst part of it occurs. Some midtribulationists, particularly those holding to a &quot;pre-wrath rapture&quot; of the church, believe that God's wrath is poured out during a  &quot;Great Tribulation&quot; that is limited to the last 3½ years of the Tribulation, after believers have been caught up to Christ.

[[Post Tribulation Rapture|Post-tribulationists]] believe that Christians will be gathered in the clouds with Christ and join him in his return to earth.  (Pretribulationist [[Tim LaHaye]] admits a post-tribulation rapture is the closest of the three views to that held by the early church.)

All three views hold that Christians will return with Christ at the end of the Tribulation.  Proponents of all three views also generally portray Israel as unwittingly signing a seven year peace treaty with the [[Antichrist]], which initiates the seven year Tribulation.  Many also tend to view the Antichrist as head of a revived Roman Empire, but the geographic location of this empire is unknown.  [[Hal Lindsey]] suggests that this revived Roman Empire will be centered in western Europe, with Rome as its capital. Tim LaHaye promotes the belief that [[Babylon (New Testament)|Babylon]] will be the capital of a worldwide empire.   Joel Richardson and [[Walid Shoebat]] have both recently written books proposing a revived eastern Roman Empire, which will fall with the boundaries of the [[Ottoman Empire]].  (Istanbul also has seven hills, was a capital of the Roman Empire and a body of water in the city is known as the [[Golden Horn]] - notable given the eschatological references to the &quot;Little Horn&quot;{{bibleverse||Daniel|7:8}},{{bibleverse-nb||Daniel|8:9}}.)

There is also a variant futuristic view that the Tribulation can occur in any generation, meaning Satan always has an antichrist in the wings and there is always a nation-state that can become the revived Roman Empire.  This variant view is developed by [[Angela Elwell Hunt|Angela Hunt]] in her fictional work, ''The Immortal''.

The futurist view was first proposed by two Catholic writers, [[Manuel Lacunza]] and [[Francisco Ribera]]. Lacunza wrote under the pen name &quot;Ben-Ezra&quot;, and his work was banned by the Catholic Church. It has grown in popularity in the 19th and 20th centuries, so that today it is probably most readily recognized. Books about the &quot;[[rapture]]&quot; by authors like [[Hal Lindsey]], and the more recent [[Left Behind (series)|Left Behind]] novels (by [[Jerry Jenkins]] and [[Tim LaHaye]]) and movies, have done much to popularize this school of thought.

The various views on tribulation are actually a subset of theological interpretations on the Millennium, mentioned in Revelation 20. There are three main interpretations: [[Premillennialism]], [[Amillennialism]], and [[Postmillennialism]].

Premillennialism believes that Christ will return to the earth, bind Satan, and reign for a literal thousand years on earth with Jerusalem as his capital. Thus Christ returns before (&quot;pre-&quot;) the thousand years mentioned in chapter 20. There are generally two subclasses of Premillennialism: Dispensational and Historic. Some form of premillennialism is thought to be the oldest millennial view in church history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = Contemporary Options in Eschatology  | last = Erickson  | first = Millard J. | publisher = Baker Book House  | year = 1982  | isbn = 0801032628}} pp.&amp;nbsp;94–95&lt;/ref&gt; [[Papias]], believed to be a disciple of the Apostle John, was a premillenialist, according to [[Eusebius]]. Also [[Justin Martyr]] and [[Irenaeus]] expressed belief in premillennialism in their writings.

Amillennialism, the traditional view for Roman Catholicism, believes that the thousand years mentioned are not ([[Privative a|&quot;a-&quot;]]) a literal thousand years, but is figurative for what is now the church age, usually, the time between Christ's first ascension and second coming. This view is often associated with [[Augustine of Hippo]].  Amillennialists differ on the time frame of the millennium.  Some say it started with Pentecost, others say it started with the fulfillment of Jesus' prophecy regarding the destruction of the temple in Jerusalem (70), and other starting points have also been proposed. Whether this eschatology is the result of [[caesaropapism]], which may have also been the reason that premillennialism was condemned, is sharply disputed.

Postmillennialism believes that Christ will return after (&quot;post-&quot;) a literal/figurative thousand years, in which the world will have essentially become a Christendom.  This view was held by [[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]].

====Historicist view====
{{Main|Historicism (Christian eschatology)}}
Historicists hold that the events predicted in the Bible have been taking place in history and will continue to take place in the future. Historicism gained popularity with the Protestant Reformation. In the 19th century, with the rise of dispensationalism, conservative Protestants largely abandoned historicism in favor of futurism.

Adventists maintain a historicist interpretation of the Bible's predictions of the apocalypse.

The [[Rastafarians]] hold to a historicist view of the book of Revelation, relating it both to 20th-century events such as the crowning of [[Ethiopia]]n Emperor [[Haile Selassie]] and the [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War]], and also to future events such as the second coming of Selassie on the day of judgment.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

====Preterist view====
{{Main|Preterism (Christian eschatology)}}
[[Preterism]] holds that the contents of Revelation constitute a prophecy of events that were fulfilled in the 1st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholic.com/library/Whore_of_Babylon.asp|title=The Whore of Babylon|publisher=Catholic Answers|accessdate=2007-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Preterism was first expounded by the Jesuit [[Luis De Alcasar]] during the [[Counter Reformation]].&lt;ref&gt;'It has been usual to say that the Spanish Jesuit Alcasar, in his Vestigatio arcani sensus in Apocalpysi (1614), was the founder of the Præterist School', Farrar, Frederic, 'The Early Days of Christianity', volume 2 (1882)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'Alcazar was the first to apply Preterism to the Apocalypse with anything like completeness, though it had previously been applied somewhat to Daniel', Froom, Leroy Edwin, 'The Prophetic Faith Of Our Fathers', volume 2, page 509 (1954)&lt;/ref&gt; The preterist view served to bolster the Catholic Church's position against attacks by Protestants,&lt;ref&gt;'It might be expected, that a commentary which thus freed the Romish church from the assaults of Protestants, would be popular among the advocates of the papacy.  Alcassar met, of course, with general approbation and reception among the Romish community', Stuart, Moses ‘A Commentary On The Apocalypse’, page 464 (1845)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'It is hardly surprising, given this general context, that the relatively few English Catholic commentators who turned their hands to the interpretation of these same passages should be concerned to counter this widely held, if somewhat variously presented, Protestant view.  The response came in three basic forms: preterism, futurism, and 'counter historicism' - a term that has been created for the purposes of this discussion', Newport, Kenneth GC, 'Apocalypse and Millennium: Studies in Biblical Eisegesis', page 74 (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; who identified the Pope with the Anti-Christ.

Preterist interpretations generally identify either [[Jerusalem in Christianity|Jerusalem]] or the [[Roman Empire]] as the persecutor of the Church, &quot;Babylon&quot;, the &quot;Mother of Harlots&quot;, etc. They see Armageddon as God's judgement on the Jews, carried out by the [[Military history of the Roman Empire|Roman army]], which is identified as &quot;the beast&quot;. It sees Revelation being fulfilled in 70, thereby bringing the full presence of God to dwell with all humanity. Some preterists see the second half of Revelation as changing focus to Rome, its persecution of Christians, and the fall of the Roman Empire.

====Eastern Orthodox view====
[[File:Apokalipsis XVI.jpg|thumb|Orthodox [[icon]] of the Apocalypse of St. John (16th century)]]

[[Eastern Orthodoxy]] treats the text as simultaneously describing contemporaneous events (events occurring at the same time) and as prophecy of events to come, for which the contemporaneous events were a form of foreshadow. It rejects attempts to determine, before the fact, if the events of Revelation are occurring by mapping them onto present-day events, taking to heart the Scriptural warning against those who proclaim &quot;He is here!&quot; prematurely. Instead, the book is seen as a warning to be spiritually and morally ready for the end times, whenever they may come (&quot;as a thief in the night&quot;), but they will come at the time of [[God]]'s choosing, not something that can be precipitated nor trivially deduced by mortals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; This view is also held by many Catholics, although there is a diversity of opinion about the nature of the Apocalypse within Catholicism.

Book of Revelation is the only book of the New Testament that is not read during services by the Eastern Orthodox Church. In the Coptic Orthodox Church (which is not in communion with the Eastern Orthodox church but is liturgically similar), the whole Book of Revelation is read during Apocalypse Night or [[Bright Saturday]] (6 days after Pascha).

====Paschal liturgical view====
This view, which has found expression among both Catholic and Protestant theologians, considers the liturgical worship, particularly the [[Easter]] rites, of early Christianity as background and context for understanding the Book of Revelation's structure and significance. This perspective is explained in ''The Paschal Liturgy and the Apocalypse'' (new edition, 2004) by [[Massey H. Shepherd]], an Episcopal scholar, and in [[Scott Hahn]]'s ''The Lamb's Supper: The Mass as Heaven on Earth'' (1999), in which he states that Revelation in form is structured after creation, fall, judgment and redemption. Those who hold this view say that the Temple's destruction (70 AD) had a profound effect on the Jewish people, not only in Jerusalem but among the Greek-speaking Jews of the Mediterranean.&lt;ref&gt;Scott Hahn, ''The Lamb's Supper: The Mass as Heaven on Earth'', ISBN 0-385-49659-1. New York, New York: Doubleday, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; They believe The Book of Revelation provides insight into the early Eucharist, saying that it is the new Temple worship in the New Heaven and Earth. The idea of the Eucharist as a foretaste of the heavenly banquet is also explored by British Methodist Geoffrey Wainwright in his book ''Eucharist and Eschatology'' (Oxford University Press, 1980).

====Esoteric view====
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2010}}
The [[Esotericism|esoterist]] views Revelation as bearing multiple levels of meaning, the lowest being the literal or &quot;dead-letter.&quot; Those who are instructed in esoteric knowledge enter gradually into more subtle levels of understanding of the text.  They see the book as delivering both a series of warnings for humanity and a detailed account of internal, spiritual processes of the individual soul.

The Gnostic Kabbalist believes that Revelation (like Genesis) is a very profound book of [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]] symbolism. This view is held by teachers such as [[H.P. Blavatsky]], [[Eliphas Levi]], [[Rudolf Steiner]].

Christian Gnostics, however, are unlikely to be attracted to the teaching of Revelation because the doctrine of salvation through the sacrificed Lamb, which is central to Revelation, is repugnant to Gnostics. Christian Gnostics &quot;believed in the Forgiveness of Sins, but in no vicarious sacrifice for sin ... they accepted Christ in the full realisation of the word; his life, not his death, was the keynote of their doctrine and their practice.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;R. [[Frances Swiney]] (Rosa Frances Emily Biggs) ''The Esoteric Teaching of the Gnostics'' London: Yellon, Williams &amp; Co (1909) p.3 &amp; 4&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James Morgan Pryse]] was an esoteric gnostic who saw Revelation as a western version of the Hindu theory of the [[Chakra]]. He began his work, &quot;The purpose of this book is to show that the Apocalypse is a manual of spiritual development and not, as conventionally interpreted, a cryptic history or prophecy&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;James M. Pryse ''Apocalypse unsealed'' London: Watkins (1910). The theory behind the book is given in [[Arthur Avalon]] (Sir John Woodroffe) ''The Serpent Power'' Madras (Chennai): Ganesh &amp; Co (1913). One version of how these beliefs might have travelled from India to the Middle East, Greece and Rome is given in the opening chapters of [[Rudolf Otto]] ''The Kingdom of God and the Son of Man'' London: Lutterworth (1938)&lt;/ref&gt; Such diverse theories have failed to command widespread acceptance. But Christopher Rowland argues: &quot;there are always going to be loose threads which refuse to be woven into the fabric as a whole. The presence of the threads which stubbornly refuse to be incorporated into the neat tapestry of our world-view does not usually totally undermine that view.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Rowland ''Revelation'' London:Epworth (1993) p.5&lt;/ref&gt;

====Radical discipleship view====
The [[radical discipleship]] view asserts that the Book of Revelation is best understood as a handbook for radical discipleship; i.e., how to remain faithful to the spirit and teachings of Jesus and avoid simply assimilating to surrounding society. In this view, the primary agenda of the book is to expose as impostors the worldly powers that seek to oppose the ways of God and God's Kingdom. The chief temptation for Christians in the 1st century, and today, is to fail to hold fast to the non-violent teachings and example of Jesus and instead be lured into unquestioning adoption and assimilation of worldly, national or cultural values - [[imperialism]], [[nationalism]], and [[civil religion]] being the most dangerous and insidious. This perspective (closely related to [[liberation theology]]) draws on the approach of Bible scholars such as [[Ched Myers]], [[William Stringfellow]], [[Richard Horsley]], [[Daniel Berrigan]], Wes Howard-Brook,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Unveiling Empire: Reading Revelation Then and Now|last= Howard-Brook|first=Wes|coauthors= Gwyther, Anthony|publisher=[[Orbis Books]]|year=1999|isbn=9781570752872}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Joerg Rieger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Christ &amp; Empire: From Paul to Postcolonial Times |last=Rieger| first=Joerg |publisher=[[Fortress Press]]| year=2007| isbn=978-0800620387}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various [[Christian anarchism|Christian anarchists]], such as [[Jacques Ellul]], have identified the [[State (polity)|State]] and [[political power]] as the [[The Beast (Bible)|Beast]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Christian Anarchism: A Political Commentary on the Gospel |last=Christoyannopoulos |first=Alexandre |authorlink=Alexandre Christoyannopoulos |coauthors= |year=2010 |publisher=Imprint Academic |location=Exeter |isbn= |page= |pages=123–126 |url= |accessdate= |quote=Revelation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Paschal spiritual view====
There is also a perspective that holds that the book of Revelation describes a spiritual battle that took place while Jesus was on the cross and in the grave.  Some [[Primitive Baptist]]s believe this to be the intended meaning.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

===Aesthetic and literary views===
Many literary writers and theorists have contributed to a wide range of views about the origins and purpose of the Book of Revelation. Some of these writers have no connection with established Christian faiths but, nevertheless, found in Revelation a source of inspiration. Revelation has been approached from Hindu philosophy and Jewish [[Midrash]]. Others have pointed to aspects of composition which have been ignored such as the similarities of prophetic inspiration to modern poetic inspiration, or the parallels with Greek drama. In recent years theories have arisen which concentrate upon how readers and texts interact to create meaning and are less interested in what the original author intended.

[[Charles Cutler Torrey]] taught semitic languages at Yale. His lasting contribution has been to show how much more meaningful prophets, such as the scribe of Revelation, are when treated as poets first and foremost. He felt this was a point often lost sight of because most English bibles render everything in prose.&lt;ref&gt;Charles C. Torrey ''The Apocalypse of John'' New Haven: Yale University Press (1958). Christopher R. North in his ''The Second Isaiah'' London: OUP (1964) p. 23 says of Torrey's earlier Isaiah theory, &quot;Few scholars of any standing have accepted his theory.&quot; This is the general view of Torrey's theories. However, Christopher North goes on to cite Torrey on 20 major occasions and many more minor ones in the course of his book. So, Torrey must have had some influence and poetry is the key.&lt;/ref&gt; Poetry was also the reason John never directly quoted the older prophets. Had he done so, he would have had to use their (Hebrew) poetry whereas he wanted to write his own. Torrey insisted Revelation had originally been written in Aramaic.&lt;ref&gt;''Apocalypse of John'' p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; This was why the surviving Greek translation was written in such a strange idiom. It was a literal translation that had to comply with the warning at Revelation 22:18 that the text must not be corrupted in any way. According to Torrey, the story is that &quot;The Fourth Gospel was brought to Ephesus by a Christian fugitive from Palestine soon after the middle of the first century. It was written in Aramaic.&quot; Later, the Ephesians claimed this fugitive had actually been the beloved disciple himself. Subsequently, this John was banished by Nero and died on Patmos after writing Revelation. Torrey argued that until 80 AD, when Christians were expelled from the synagogues,&lt;ref&gt;''Apocalypse of John'' p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; the Christian message was always first heard in the synagogue and, for cultural reasons, the evangelist would have spoken in Aramaic, else &quot;he would have had no hearing.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Apocalypse of John'' p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Torrey showed how the three major songs in Revelation (the new song, the song of Moses and the Lamb and the chorus at 19: 6-8) each fall naturally into four regular metrical lines plus a coda.&lt;ref&gt;''Apocalypse of John'' p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; Other dramatic moments in Revelation, such as 6: 16 where the terrified people cry out to be hidden, behave in a similar way.&lt;ref&gt;''Apocalypse of John'' p. 140&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christina Rossetti]] was a Victorian poet who believed the sensual excitement of the natural world found its meaningful purpose in death and in God.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Flowers preach to us if we will hear&quot;, begins her poem 'Consider the lilies of the field' ''Goblin Market'' London: Oxford University Press (1913) p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; Her ''The Face of the Deep'' is a meditation upon the Apocalypse. In her view, what Revelation has to teach is patience.&lt;ref&gt;Ms Rossetti remarks that patience is a word which does not occur in the Bible until the New Testament, as if the usage first came from Christ's own lips. Christina Rossetti ''The Face of the Deep'' London: SPCK (1892) p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; Patience is the closest to perfection the human condition allows.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Christians should resemble fire-flies, not glow-worms; their brightness drawing eyes upward, not downward.&quot; ''The Face of the Deep'' p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; Her book, which is largely written in prose, frequently breaks into poetry or jubilation, much like Revelation itself. The relevance of John's visions&lt;ref&gt;'vision' lends the wrong emphasis as Ms Rossetti sought to minimise the distinction between John's experience and that of others. She quoted 1 John 3:24 &quot;He abideth in us, by the Spirit which he hath given us&quot; to show that when John says, &quot;I was in the Spirit&quot; it is not exceptional.&lt;/ref&gt; belongs to Christians of all times as a continuous present meditation. Such matters are eternal and outside of normal human reckoning. &quot;That winter which will be the death of Time has no promise of termination. Winter that returns not to spring ... - who can bear it?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''The Face of the Deep'' p. 301&lt;/ref&gt; She dealt deftly with the vengeful aspects of John's message. &quot;A few are charged to do judgment; everyone without exception is charged to show mercy.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''The Face of the Deep'' p. 292&lt;/ref&gt; Her conclusion is that Christians should see John as &quot;representative of all his brethren&quot; so they should &quot;hope as he hoped, love as he loved.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''The Face of the Deep'' p. 495&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, aesthetic and literary modes of interpretation have developed, which focus on Revelation as a work of art and imagination, viewing the imagery as symbolic depictions of timeless truths and the victory of good over evil. [[Elisabeth Schuessler Fiorenza]] wrote ''Revelation: Vision of a just world'' from the viewpoint of rhetoric.&lt;ref&gt;Elisabeth Schuessler Fiorenza ''Revelation: Vision of a just world'' Edinburgh: T&amp;T Clark (1993). The book seems to have started life as ''Invitation to the Book of Revelation'' Garden City: Doubleday (1981)&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, Revelation's meaning is partially determined by the way John goes about saying things, partially by the context in which readers receive the message and partially by its appeal to something beyond logic. It is Professor Schuessler Fiorenza's view that Revelation has particular relevance today as a liberating message to disadvantaged groups. John's book is a vision of a just world, not a vengeful threat of world-destruction. Her view that Revelation's message is not gender-based has caused dissent. She says we are to look behind the symbols rather than make a fetish out of them. Tina Pippin puts an opposing view:&lt;ref&gt;Tina Pippin ''Death &amp; Desire: The rhetoric of gender in the Apocalypse of John'' Louisville: Westminster-John Knox (1993) p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; that John writes &quot;horror literature&quot; and &quot;the misogyny which underlies the narrative is extreme&quot;. Professor Schuessler Fiorenza would seem to be saying John's book is more like science fiction; it does not foretell the future but uses present-day concepts to show how contemporary reality could be very different.

[[D. H. Lawrence]] took an opposing, pessimistic view of Revelation in the final book he wrote, ''Apocalypse''.&lt;ref&gt;D. H. Lawrence ''Apocalypse'' London: Martin Secker (1932) published posthumously with an introduction (p. v - xli) by Richard Aldington which is an integral part of the text.&lt;/ref&gt; He saw the language which Revelation used as being bleak and destructive; a 'death-product'. Instead, he wanted to champion a public-spirited individualism (which he identified with the historical Jesus supplemented by an ill-defined cosmic consciousness) against its two natural enemies. One of these he called &quot;the sovereignty of the intellect&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Apocalypse'' p. xxiii&lt;/ref&gt; which he saw in a technology-based totalitarian society. The other enemy he styled &quot;vulgarity&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Apocalypse'' p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; and that was what he found in Revelation. &quot;It is very nice if you are poor and not humble ... to bring your enemies down to utter destruction, while you yourself rise up to grandeur. And nowhere does this happen so splendiferously than in Revelation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Apocalypse p. 11 Lawrence did not consider how these two types of Christianity (good and bad in his view) might be related other than as opposites. He noted the difference meant that the John who wrote a gospel could not be the same John that wrote Revelation.&lt;/ref&gt; His specific aesthetic objections to Revelation were that its imagery was unnatural and that phrases like &quot;the wrath of the Lamb&quot; were &quot;ridiculous&quot;. He saw Revelation as comprising two discordant halves. In the first, there was a scheme of cosmic renewal &quot;great Chaldean sky-spaces&quot; which he quite liked. Then the book hinged around the birth of the baby messiah. After that, &quot;flamboyant hate and simple lust ... for the end of the world.&quot; Lawrence coined the term &quot;Patmossers&quot; to describe those Christians who could only be happy in paradise if they knew their enemies were suffering hell.

===Academic views===
Modern biblical scholarship attempts to understand Revelation in its 1st century historical context within the genre of Jewish and Christian [[apocalyptic literature]].

This approach considers the text as an address to seven historical communities in Asia Minor.  Under this view, assertions that &quot;the time is near&quot; are to be taken literally by those communities. Consequently the work is viewed as a warning not to conform to contemporary Greco-Roman society which John &quot;unveils&quot; as beastly, demonic and subject to divine judgment. There is further information on these topics in the entries on [[higher criticism]] and [[apocalyptic literature]].

The acceptance of Revelation into the [[Biblical canon|canon]] is itself the result of a historical process, essentially no different from the career of other texts. The eventual exclusion of other contemporary apocalyptic literature from the canon may throw light on the unfolding historical processes of what was officially considered orthodox, what was [[heterodox]], what was even heretical.  Interpretation of meanings and imagery are anchored in what the historical author intended and what his contemporary audience inferred; a message to Christians not to assimilate into the Roman imperial culture was John's central message. Thus, his letter (written in the apocalyptic genre) is pastoral in nature, and the symbolism of Revelation is to be understood entirely within its historical, literary and social context. Critics study the conventions of [[apocalyptic literature]] and events of the 1st century to make sense of what the author may have intended.

During a discussion about Revelation on 23 August 2006, [[Pope Benedict XVI]] remarked: &quot;The seer of Patmos, identified with the apostle, is granted a series of visions meant to reassure the Christians of Asia amid the persecutions and trials of the end of the first century.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholic.org/international/international_story.php?id=20995 Pope Benedict: Read Book of Revelation as Christ's victory over evil - Catholic Online]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism===
19th-century [[agnostic]] [[Robert G. Ingersoll]] branded Revelation &quot;the insanest of all books&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =The Devil| author =Robert Green Ingersoll| url =http://www.infidels.org/library/historical/robert_ingersoll/devil.html | accessdate =2007-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Jefferson]] omitted it, along with most of the Biblical canon, from the [[Jefferson Bible]], and wrote that at one time he considered it as &quot;merely the ravings of a maniac, no more worthy nor capable of explanation than the incoherences of our own nightly dreams.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.constitution.org/tj/jeff16.htm Bergh: Writings of Thomas Jefferson, Vol. 16]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Friedrich Engels]] claimed that the Book of Revelation was primarily a political and anti-Roman work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/subject/religion/book-revelations.htm &quot;The Book of Revelation&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Bernard Shaw]] described it as &quot;a peculiar record of the visions of a drug addict&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/keith_gilmour/revelation.html Keith Gilmour on Revelation]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Martin Luther]] changed his perspective on Revelation over time. In the preface to the German translation of Revelation that he composed in 1522, he said that he did not consider the book prophetic or apostolic, since &quot;Christ is neither taught nor known in it.&quot; But in the completely new preface that he composed in 1530, he reversed his position and concluded that Christ was central to the book. He concluded, &quot;As we see here in this book, that through and beyond all plagues, beasts, and evil angels, Christ is nonetheless with the saints and wins the final victory.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;For the preface of 1522 see Luther's Works volume 35 pp. 398–399. For the quotation of the preface from 1530 see the same volume, p. 411.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Old Testament origins==
There is much in Revelation which harnesses ancient sources. Although the Old Testament provides the largest reservoir for such sources, it is not the only one. For example, Howard-Brook and Gwyther&lt;ref&gt;Wes Howard-Brook &amp; Anthony Gwyther ''Unveiling Empire'' New York: Orbis (1999) p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; regard the [[Book of Enoch]] (1 Enoch) as an equally significant but contextually different source. &quot;Enoch's journey has no close parallel in the Hebrew scriptures.&quot;

Until recently, academics showed little interest in this topic.&lt;ref&gt;S Moyise p.13 reports no work whatsoever done between 1912 and 1984&lt;/ref&gt; But this was not the case with popular writers from non-conforming backgrounds. They liked to intersperse their text of Revelation with the prophecy they thought was being promised fulfilment. For example, an anonymous Scottish commentary of 1871&lt;ref&gt;Anon ''An exposition of the Apocalypse on a new principle of literal interpretation'' Aberdeen: Brown (1871)&lt;/ref&gt; prefaces Revelation 4 with the Little Apocalypse of Mark 13, places Malachi 4:5 (Behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord) within Revelation 11, and writes Revelation 12:7 side-by-side with the role of 'the satan' in the [[Book of Job]]. The message is that everything in Revelation will happen in its previously appointed time.

Steve Moyise&lt;ref&gt;S. Moyise ''The Old Testament in the Book of Revelation'' Sheffield: [[Sheffield Academic Press]] (1995) p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; uses the index of the United Bible Societies' Greek New Testament to show that &quot;Revelation contains more Old Testament allusions than any other New Testament book, but it does not record a single quotation.&quot; Perhaps significantly, Revelation chooses different sources than other New Testament books. Revelation concentrates on Isaiah, the Psalms and Ezekiel and neglects, comparatively speaking, the books of the Pentateuch which are the dominant sources for other New Testament writers. Methodological objections have been made to this way of proceeding. Each allusion may not have an equal significance. To counter this, G. K. Beale sought to develop a system that distinguished 'clear', 'probable' and 'possible' allusions. A clear allusion is one with almost the same wording as its source, the same general meaning and which could not reasonably have been drawn from elsewhere. A probable allusion contains an idea which is uniquely traceable to its source. Possible allusions are described as mere echoes of their putative sources.

Yet, with Revelation, the problems might be judged more fundamental than this. John seems to be using his sources in a completely different way to the originals. For example, John borrows the 'new temple' imagery of Ezekiel 40 to 48 but uses it to describe a New Jerusalem which, quite pointedly, no longer needs any temple at all because the new city is now God's own dwelling-place. Ian Boxall&lt;ref&gt;Ian Boxall The Revelation of St John London: Continuum &amp; Peabody MA: Hendrickson (2006) p. 254&lt;/ref&gt; writes that Revelation &quot;is no montage of biblical quotations (that is not John's way) but a wealth of allusions and evocations rewoven into something new and creative.&quot; In trying to identify this something new, he argues that Ezekiel provides the 'backbone' for Revelation. He sets out a comparative table listing the chapters of Revelation in sequence then identifying against most of them the structurally corresponding chapter in Ezekiel. The interesting point is that the order is not the same. John, on this theory, rearranges Ezekiel to suit his own purposes.

Some commentators argue that it is these purposes - and not the structure - that really matters. It is the view of G. K. Beale that, however much use John makes of Ezekiel, his ultimate purpose is to present Revelation as a fulfilment of Daniel 7.&lt;ref&gt;G. K. Beale John's use of the Old Testament in Revelation Sheffield: Sheffield Academic Press (1998) p. 109&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Tanakh OT}}

The '''Book(s) of Kings''' ({{lang-he|''Sepher M'lakhim'', ספר מלכים}} - the two books were originally one&lt;ref&gt;Fretheim, p.1&lt;/ref&gt;) presents a narrative [[history of ancient Israel and Judah]] from the death of [[David]] to the release of his successor [[Jehoiachin]] from imprisonment in Babylon, a period of some 400 years (c.960-560 BCE).&lt;ref&gt;Sweeney, p.1&lt;/ref&gt; It concludes a series of historical books running from [[Book of Joshua|Joshua]] through [[Book of Judges|Judges]] and [[Books of Samuel|Samuel]], the overall purpose which is to provide a theological explanation for the destruction of the Jewish kingdom by Babylon in 586 BCE and a foundation for a return from exile.&lt;ref&gt;Sweeney, p.1&lt;/ref&gt;

Kings begins with the death of [[David]], to whom [[Yahweh]], the god of [[Israelites|Israel]], has promised an eternal dynasty, and the succession of his son Solomon. Solomon is praised for his wisdom and wealth, but he offends Yahweh by allowing other gods to be worshiped in Jerusalem. God therefore breaks the kingdom in two, with David's line reigning in the southern [[kingdom of Judah]] with a separate [[kingdom of Israel]] in the north. The kings of Israel are uniformly evil, allowing gods other than Yahweh to be worshiped, and eventually God brings about the destruction of the kingdom. A few of the kings of Judah are good, but most are evil, and eventually God destroys this kingdom also.

==Summary==
[[Image:Saabaghiberti.jpg|thumb|250px|Solomon greeting the Queen of Sheba - gate of [[Florence Baptistry]]]]
''See [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Kings+1%3A1&amp;version=NIV 1 Kings] and [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Kings%201&amp;version=NIV 2 Kings] at Bible Gateway''

[[David]] dies and [[Solomon]] comes to the throne. At the beginning of his reign he assumes God's promises to David and brings splendour to Israel and peace and prosperity to his people.&lt;ref&gt;Fretheim, p.19&lt;/ref&gt; The centrepiece of Solomon's reign is the building of the [[Temple of Solomon|First Temple]]: the claim that this took place 480 years after [[the Exodus]] from Egypt marks it as a key event in Israel's history.&lt;ref&gt;Fretheim, p.40&lt;/ref&gt; At the end, however, he follows other gods and oppresses Israel.&lt;ref&gt;Fretheim, p.20&lt;/ref&gt;

As a consequence of Solomon's apostasy and abuse of royal office the kingdom of David is split in two in the reign of his own son [[Jeroboam]], who becomes the first to reign over the [[kingdom of Judah]].&lt;ref&gt;Sweeney, p.161&lt;/ref&gt; The kings who follow Jeroboam in Jerusalem continue the royal line of David (i.e., they inherit the promise to David); in the north, however, dynasties follow each other in rapid succession, and the kings are uniformly bad (meaning that they fail to follow Yahweh alone). At length God brings the [[Assyria]]ns to destroy the northern kingdom, leaving Judah as the sole custodian of the promise.

[[Hezekiah]], the first king since David to be called &quot;good,&quot; institutes a far reaching religious reform, centralising sacrifice at the temple at Jerusalem and destroying the images of other gods, and Yahweh saves Jerusalem and the kingdom from an invasion by Assyria. But [[Manasseh of Judah|Manasseh]], the next king, reverses the reforms,  and God announces that he will destroy Jerusalem because of this apostasy by the king. Mannasah's righteous grandson [[Josiah]] reinstitutes the reforms of Hezekiah, but it is too late: God, speaking through the prophetess [[Huldah]], affirms that Jerusalem is to be destroyed. God brings the [[Babylon]]ians, Jerusalem is razed and the Temple destroyed, and the priests, prophets and royal court are led into captivity. (The final verses record how Jehoiachin, the last king, is set free and given honour by the king of Babylon).

==Composition==

===Textual history===
In the original [[Hebrew bible]] (the bible used by Jews) First and Second Kings were a single book, as were First and Second Samuel. When this was translated into Greek in the last few centuries (with some notable differences from the Hebrew text), Kings was joined with Samuel in a four-part work called the Book of Kingdoms. The [[Greek Orthodox]] branch of Christianity continues to use the Septuagint, but when a Latin translation of the Septuagint (called the [[Vulgate]]) was made for the Western church, Kingdoms was first retitled the Book of Kings, parts One to Four, and eventually Kings and Samuel were separated, but as two books each.&lt;ref&gt;Tomes, p.246&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Deuteronomistic history===
According to Jewish tradition the author of Kings was [[Jeremiah]], whose life overlapped the fall of Jerusalem in 586 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Spieckermann, p.337&lt;/ref&gt; The most common view today accepts [[Martin Noth]]'s thesis that Kings concludes a unified series of books which reflect the language and theology of the [[Book of Deuteronomy]], and which biblical scholars therefore call the [[Deuteronomistic history]].&lt;ref&gt;Perdue, xxvii&lt;/ref&gt; Noth argued that the History was the work of a single individual living in the 6th century, but scholars today tend to treat it as made up of at least two layers,&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p.85&lt;/ref&gt; a first edition from the time of [[Josiah]] (late 7th century), promoting Josiah's religious reforms and the need for repentance, and (2) a second and final edition from  the mid 6th century.&lt;ref&gt;Fretheim, p.7&lt;/ref&gt; Further levels of editing have also been proposed, including: a late 8th century edition pointing to [[Hezekiah]] of Judah as the model for kingship; an earlier 8th century version with a similar message but identifying [[Jehu]] of Israel as the ideal king; and an even earlier version promoting the House of David as the key to national well-being.&lt;ref&gt;Sweeney, p.4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sources===
The editors/authors of the Deuteronomistic history cite a number of sources, including (for example) a &quot;Book of the Acts of Solomon&quot; and, frequently, the &quot;Annals of the Kings of Judah&quot; and a separate annal of the kings of Israel. The &quot;Deuteronomic&quot; perspective (that of the book of Deuteronomy) is particularly evident in prayers and speeches spoken by key figures at major transition points: Solomon's speech at the dedication of the Temple is a key example.&lt;ref&gt;Fretheim, p.7&lt;/ref&gt; The sources have been heavily edited to meet the Deuteronomistic agenda,&lt;ref&gt;Van Seters, p.307&lt;/ref&gt; but in the the broadest sense they appear to have been:
*1 Kings 1-2: The end of the &quot;[[court history of David]]&quot; (also called the Succession Narrative), which also constitutes most of 2 Samuel 9-20. The redactor has added notes at 1 Kings 2:2-4 and 2:10-12.
*For the rest of Solomon's reign the text names its source as &quot;the book of the acts of Solomon&quot;, but other sources were employed, and much was added by the redactor.
*Israel and Judah: The two &quot;chronicles&quot; of Israel and Judah provided the chronological framework, but few details apart from the succession of monarchs and the account of how the [[Temple of Solomon]] was progressively stripped as true religion declined. A third source, or set of sources, were cycles of stories about various prophets ([[Elijah]] and [[Elisha]], [[Isaiah]], [[Ahijah]] and [[Micaiah]]), plus a few smaller miscellaneous traditions. The conclusion of the book (2 Kings 25:18-21 and 27:30) was probably based on personal knowledge.
*A few sections were editorial additions not based on sources. These include various predictions of the downfall of the northern kingdom, the equivalent prediction of the downfall of Judah following the reign of [[Manasseh]], the extension of [[Josiah]]'s reforms in accordance with the laws of [[Deuteronomy]], and the revision of the narrative from [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]] concerning Judah's last days.&lt;ref&gt;McKenzie, pp.281-284&lt;/ref&gt;

Kings is &quot;history-like,&quot; but it mixes legends, folktales, miracle stories and fiction in with the annals, and its primary explanation for all that happens is God's offended sense of what is right; it is therefore more fruitful to read it as theological literature in the form of history.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, pp.1-2&lt;/ref&gt; The theological bias is seen in the way it judges each king of Israel on the basis of whether he recognises the authority of the temple in Jerusalem (none do, and therefore all are &quot;evil&quot;), and each king of Judah on the basis of whether he destroys the &quot;high places&quot; (rivals to the Temple in Jerusalem); it gives only passing mention to  important and successful kings like [[Omri]] and [[Jeroboam II]] and totally ignores one of the most significant events in ancient Israel's history, the [[battle of Qarqar]].&lt;ref&gt;Sutherland, p.489&lt;/ref&gt; 

The major themes of Kings are God's promise, the recurrent apostasy of the kings, and the judgement this brings on Israel:&lt;ref&gt;Fretheim, pp.10-14 &lt;/ref&gt;
*Promise: In return for Israel's promise to worship Yahweh alone, Yahweh makes promises to David and to Israel - to David, the promise that his line will rule Israel forever, to Israel, the promise of the land they will possess.
*Apostasy: the great tragedy of Israel's history, meaning the destruction of the kingdom and the Temple, is due to the failure of the people, but more especially the kings, to worship Yahweh alone (Yahweh being the god of Israel).
*Judgement: Apostasy leads to judgement. Judgement is not punishment, but simply the natural (or rather, God-ordained) consequence of Israel's failure to worship Yahweh alone.

Another and related theme is that of prophesy. The main point of the prophetic stories is that God's prophesies are always fulfilled, so that any not yet fulfilled will be so in the future. The implication, seen in the closing scenes of the book, with the release of Jehoiachin and his restoration to a place of honour in Babylon, is the promise to David of an eternal dynasty is still in effect, and the Davidic line will be restored.&lt;ref&gt;Sutherland, p.490&lt;/ref&gt;

==Textual features==
===Chronology===
The chronology of Kings makes no sense at several points.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, p.10&lt;/ref&gt; The duration of reigns for the kings of Judah does not correspond correctly to their supposed times of accession compared to the reigns of the kings of Israel. Assigning the number of years after Solomon that each king of Judah reigned, by comparing the figure for their predecessor and the length of their predecessor's reign, simply does not equal the figure that you would obtain by comparing the figures for the kings of Israel and which year the king of Judah began to rule compared to the reign of the contemporary king of Israel. The same issue applies to the kings of Israel. There are also external difficulties: Ahaz, according to Kings, reigned for only 16 years, but some of the events of his reign are recorded elsewhere and require Ahaz to have ruled at least  between 735 BCE and 715 BCE, a period of 20 years. Conservative scholars such as [[Edwin Thiele]] have put forward detailed proposals for overcoming the difficulties, but there is no consensus.

===Kings and 2 Chronicles===
2 Chronicles covers much the same time-period as Kings, but with significant differences: Chronicles ignores the northern [[kingdom of Israel]] almost completely, David is given a major role in planning the Temple, Hezekiah is given a much more far-reaching program of reform, and Manasseh is given an opportunity to repent of his sins, apparently to account for his long reign).&lt;ref&gt;Sutherland, p.247&lt;/ref&gt; It is usually assumed that the author of Chronicles used Kings as a source and re-wrote history as he would have liked it to have been,&lt;ref&gt;Sutherland, p.247&lt;/ref&gt; but it has been suggested that Chronicles may have used an early version of Kings which he reproduces faithfully.

===Problems of names===
The name ''Hadad'' and compounds of it occur at several locations within the text. Hadad is the name of the Canaanite deity that is often who the term Ba'al (which means ''lord'') refers to. Consequently many kings from the region surrounding Israel and Judah would take throne names that were [[theophory]] in Hadad (or Ba'al), which has can lead to much confusion in the text, and some difficulty in identifying which people are the same individuals and which are different:
*''Hadadezer'' (''Hadad''+''ezer'') is an Assyrian king
*''Hadad'' is the name of a king of Edom
*''Ben-hadad'' is the name of one or more kings of Aram. Although this name simply means ''son of Hadad'' it does not necessarily mean that Hadad was the name of the king's father, but simply that the king was a king (i.e. a son of Hadad - the god)
*''King Hadad'' is the name of a god (according to the text), i.e. Hadad

In addition, while ''Ba'al'' is usually used to refer to Hadad, the term ''[[Baalzebub]]'' also appears as the name of a deity. ''Ba'alzebub'', meaning ''lord of the flies'', is most likely to be a deliberate [[pun]], by the anti-Hadad writer, on the term ''Ba'alzebul'', meaning ''prince Ba'al'', i.e. Hadad. Even more confusing is the fact that some passages refer to a single king of Assyria by two different names, whereas others refer simply to ''the king of Assyria'' in several places but are actually talking about 2 separate historically attested kings, not the same individual.

This problem is compounded in the names of Israelite and Judahite kings, where theophoric suffixes and prefixes exist in El and Yah/Yahweh, namely ''Ja....'', ''Jeho...'', ''....iah'', ''...el'', and ''El....''. It was common to drop the theophory in ordinary day to day life, so that, for example, ''Daniel'' becomes simply ''Dan''. In some cases double theophory occurred, as for example in the name of the king of Judah that contemporary cuneiform inscriptions record as ''Jeconiah'' (''Je''+''Con''+''Iah''), which the [[Book of Jeremiah]] drops one of the theophories to make the name simply ''Choniah'' (''Chon''+''Iah''), while the Book of Kings moves both theophories next to each other making his name ''Jehoiachin'' (''Jeho''+''Iah''+''chon''). Similarly theophory was often flexible as to which end of names it occurred at for a single individual, so that the king of Judah which the Book of Kings names as ''Ahaziah'' (''Ahaz'' + ''iah'') is named by the Book of Chronicles as ''Jehoahaz'' (''Jeho'' + ''ahaz'') - ultimately this is the same name as had by the later king referred to as ''Ahaz''.

{{Tanakh OT}}
The '''Book of Ruth''' ({{lang-he|מגילת רות}}; [[Sephardi Hebrew language|Sephardic]], [[Hebrew language#Modern Israeli Hebrew|Israeli]] Hebrew:  {{IPA-he|məɡiˈlat rut|}}; [[Ashkenazi Hebrew]]: {{IPA|[məˈɡɪləs rus]}}; Biblical Hebrew: '''''Megilath Ruth''''' &quot;the Scroll of Ruth&quot;) is one of the books of the [[Hebrew Bible]], [[Tanakh]], or [[Old Testament]]. In the Jewish canon the Book of Ruth is included in the third division, or the Writings ([[Ketuvim]]). In the [[Old Testament|Christian canon]] the Book of Ruth is placed between [[Book of Judges|Judges]] and [[1 Samuel]].&lt;ref&gt;Coogan, Michael D. &quot;A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament.&quot; Oxford University Press, 2009. p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a rather short book, in both Jewish and Christian scripture, consisting of only four chapters.

==Title==
The full title in Hebrew is named after a [[Ruth (biblical figure)|young woman]] of [[Moab]], the great-grandmother of [[David]] and, according to the Christian tradition, an ancestress of [[Jesus]]:{{hebrew|מגילת רות}}, ''Megillat Ruth'', or &quot;the scroll of Ruth&quot;, which places the book as one of the [[Five Megillot]]. Goswell argues that while [[Naomi (Bible)|Naomi]] is the ''central'' character of the book, Ruth is the ''main'' character, and so the book &quot;can be considered aptly named.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Goswell, &quot;What's in a Name? Book Titles in the Latter Prophets and Writings&quot;, ''Pacfica'' 21 (2008), 8.&lt;/ref&gt; The other Biblical books bearing the name of women are the [[Book of Esther]] and the [[Book of Judith]] (except among Jews and most Protestants, who exclude the [[Book of Judith]] as apocryphal).

==Synopsis==
{{Books of the Old Testament}}
During the time of the [[Book of Judges|Judges]] when there was a famine, an Israelite family from [[Bethlehem]]—Elimelech, his wife [[Naomi (Bible)|Naomi]], and their sons [[Mahlon and Chilion]]—emigrate to the nearby country of [[Moab]]. Elimelech dies, and the sons marry two Moabite women: Mahlon marries [[Ruth (biblical figure)|Ruth]] and Chilion marries [[Orpah]].

The two sons of Naomi then die themselves. Naomi decides to return to Bethlehem. She tells her daughters-in-law to return to their own mothers, and remarry. Orpah reluctantly leaves; however, Ruth says, &quot;Entreat me not to leave you, or to turn back from following you; For wherever you go, I will go; And wherever you lodge, I will lodge; Your people shall be my people, and your God, my God. Where you die, I will die, and there will I be buried. The LORD do so to me, and more also, if anything but death parts you and me.&quot; (Ruth 1:16–17 NKJV)

The two women return to Bethlehem. It is the time of the barley harvest, and in order to support her mother-in-law and herself, Ruth goes to the fields to [[gleaning|glean]]. The field she goes to belongs to a man named [[Boaz]], who is kind to her because he has heard of her loyalty to her mother-in-law. Ruth tells her mother-in-law of Boaz's kindness, and she gleans in his field through the remainder of the harvest season.

Boaz is a close relative of Naomi's husband's family. He is therefore obliged by the [[Levirate]] law to marry Mahlon's widow, Ruth, in order to carry on his family line. Naomi sends Ruth to the threshing floor at night and tells her to &quot;uncover the feet&quot; of the sleeping Boaz. Ruth does so; Boaz awakes and asks,&quot;Who are you?&quot; Ruth identifies herself, then asks Boaz to spread his cloak over her. The phrase &quot;spread your cloak&quot; was a woman's way of asking for marriage. For a man to spread his cloak over a woman showed acquisition of that woman.&lt;ref&gt;Attridge, Harold W. &amp; Meeks, Wayne A., ed. &quot;The HarperCollins Study Bible.&quot; HarperCollins Publishers, 2006. footnote on 3:9, p. 387.&lt;/ref&gt;  Boaz states he is willing to &quot;redeem&quot; Ruth via marriage, but informs Ruth that there is another male relative who has the first right of redemption.

The next morning, Boaz discusses the issue with the other male relative, [[Placeholder names in different languages#Hebrew|Ploni Almoni]] (&quot;so-and-so&quot;) before the town elders. The other male relative is unwilling to jeopardize the inheritance of his own estate by marrying Ruth, and so relinquishes his right of redemption, thus allowing Boaz to marry Ruth.  They transfer the property and redeem it by the nearer kinsman taking off his sandal and handing it over to Boaz. (Ruth 4:7-18)

Boaz and Ruth get married and have a son named Obed (who by Levirate customs is also considered a son or heir to Elimelech (and thus Naomi).  In the genealogy which concludes the story, it is pointed out that Obed is the descendant of [[Pharez|Perez]] the son of Judah, and the grandfather of [[David]].

Traditionally ascribed to the [[Samuel (Bible)|prophet Samuel]], it is now regarded as a novella of probable Hellenistic-era date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url = http://books.google.com/books?id=wJQvoHg91QkC&amp;pg=PA47&amp;lpg=PA47&amp;dq=%22the+book+of+ruth%22+bible+novella&amp;source=web&amp;ots=Vk8xt9VyYW&amp;sig=hvqJT1B1i0p0Ur59QnpIb37QGPg| title =  Book of Ruth | author= Hubbard, Robert L.| page=47| year = 1989 | accessdate = December 30, 2007 | isbn=9780802825261 | publisher=Wm.

==Analysis==
The mood of the story is fashioned from the start through names of the participants: Naomi, which means &quot;my gracious one&quot; or &quot;my delight,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cf.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=H05281&amp;t=kjv Naomi, Blue Letter Bible Lexicon]&lt;/ref&gt; later asks to be called Mara, &quot;the bitter one&quot;;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cf.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=H04755&amp;t=kjv Mara, Blue Letter Bible Lexicon]&lt;/ref&gt; her two sons are Mahlon, &quot;sick&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://cf.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=H04248&amp;t=kjv Mahlon, Blue Letter Bible Lexicon]&lt;/ref&gt; and Chilion, &quot;weakening&quot; or &quot;pining&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cf.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon /lexicon.cfm?Strongs=H03630&amp;t=kjv Chilion, Blue Letter Bible Lexicon]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Orpah]], meaning &quot;mane&quot; or &quot;gazelle&quot;, is from the root for &quot;nape&quot; or &quot;back of the neck&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://cf.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=H06204&amp;t=kjv Orpah, Blue Letter Bible Lexicon]&lt;/ref&gt; appropriate for the daughter-in-law who turns her back on Naomi and returns to her people. Ruth, meaning &quot;friend&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://cf.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=H07327&amp;t=kjv Ruth, Blue Letter Bible Lexicon]&lt;/ref&gt; pledges loyalty to Naomi, and Boaz, &quot;fleetness&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cf.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=H01162&amp;t=kjv Boaz, Blue Letter Bible Lexicon]&lt;/ref&gt; or &quot;strength is (in) him&quot; or &quot;he comes in strength&quot; becomes the [[Goel|kinsman redeemer]], while Obed's name appropriately means &quot;servant.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cf.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=H05744&amp;t=kjv Obed, Blue Letter Bible Lexicon]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The marriage of Boaz and Ruth was of a type known as a [[Levirate marriage]].  Since there is no heir to inherit Elimelech's land, levirate custom required a close relative (usually a brother-in-law) to marry the widow of the deceased in order to continue his family line ([[Deuteronomy]] 25:5–10).  The case in the book of Ruth is not the simplest type of Levirate marriage (Ruth is not Elimelech's widow and Boaz is not his brother); therefore, some scholars refer to Boaz’s duty as &quot;Levirate-like&quot; or as a &quot;kinsman-marriage.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;LaSor et al.&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, it seems that an understanding of this kind of redemption among the Israelites included both that of people and of land.  In Israel land had to stay in the family.  The family could mortgage the land to ward off poverty; and the law of Leviticus 25:25ff required a kinsman to purchase it back into the family.  The kinsman, who Boaz meets at the city gate, first says he will purchase the land, but, upon hearing he must also take Ruth as his wife, withdraws his offer. His decision was primarily a financial decision since a child born to Ruth through the union would inherit Elimelech's land, and he would not be reimbursed for the money he paid Naomi.  Boaz becomes Ruth and Naomi's &quot;kinsman-redeemer.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.hopeofisrael.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=37&amp;Itemid=32| title =  Kinsman Redeemer| publisher = Hope of Israel Baptist Mission| year = 2008 | accessdate = December 30, 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071214233231/http://www.hopeofisrael.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=37&amp;Itemid=32 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = December 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Israelites' understanding of redemption is woven into their understanding of and appreciation of the nature of the &quot;Almighty One&quot;. God stands by the oppressed and needy.  Through his servants, he extends his love and [[mercy]], liberating through hope. God has a deep concern for the welfare of his people, materially, emotionally and spiritually.  The redemption theme extends beyond this biblical book through the genealogy.  First, in Ruth 4:13 God made her conceive.  Second, through the genealogy it is shown that the son born to Naomi is more than just a gift from God to continue her lineage. The history of God's rule through the David line connects the book's theme in to the Bible's main theme of redemptive history.

''[[Hesed]]'', sometimes translated as &quot;loving kindness&quot;, also implies loyalty. The theme of ''hesed'' is woven throughout Ruth, beginning at 1:8 with Naomi blessing her two daughters-in-law as she urges them to return to their Moabite families.  She says, &quot;May the Lord deal kindly with you, as you have dealt with the dead and with me.&quot;  Both Ruth and Boaz demonstrate ''hesed'' to their family members throughout the story.  These are not acts of kindness with an expectation of measure for measure.  Rather, they are acts of ''hesed'' that go beyond measure and demonstrate that a person can go beyond the minimum expectations of the law and choose the unexpected. However, the importance of the law is evident within the Book of Ruth, and the story reflects a need to stay within legal boundaries.  Boaz, in going beyond measure in acquiring the property (demonstrating ''[[hesed]]''), redeems not only the land but both Naomi and Ruth as well.  The two widows now have a secure and protected future.

===Jewish and Christian perspectives===
The figure of Ruth is celebrated as a convert to Judaism who understood Jewish principles and took them to heart. This book is also held in esteem by Jews who fall under the category of [[Conversion to Judaism|Jews-by-choice]], as is evidenced by the considerable presence of Boaz in rabbinic literature. As well, the &quot;Book of Ruth&quot; functions liturgically, as it is read during the [[Jewish holiday]] of [[Shavuot]] (&quot;Weeks&quot;), or [[Pentecost]]. This is most likely due to the fact that the story takes place during the barley harvest, and that Shavuot is the celebration of the end of the barley harvest and the beginning of the wheat harvest.&lt;ref&gt;Attridge, Harold W. &amp; Meeks, Wayne A., ed. &quot;The HarperCollins Study Bible.&quot; HarperCollins Publishers, 2006. p. 383.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruth figures as one of four females named in the genealogy of Jesus at the beginning of the Gospel of Matthew. Many Christians interpret Boaz and Ruth as [[Typology (theology)|typical]] of Jesus and the Church.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christiancourier.com/articles/1110-lessons-from-the-book-of-ruth Lessons from the Book of Ruth]&lt;/ref&gt; Ruth's famous words, &quot;For wherever you go, I will go ...&quot;, are used in Jewish, [[Catholicism|Catholic]] and some [[Protestantism|Protestant]] marriage services. Ruth is also commemorated as a matriarch in the [[Calendar of Saints (Lutheran)|Calendar of Saints]] of the [[Lutheran Church - Missouri Synod]] on July 16, and is one of the Five Heroines of the [[Order of the Eastern Star]].

===Ethical Importance===
1. Inclusivity: Ruth, a Moabite, voluntarily embraces Naomi's people, land, culture, and God. The book of Ruth portrays a perfect example of a true belief in the Creator God in that it propagates inclusion of all, even in the ancient world of the Israelites where separation is made obvious between Israelites and non-Israelites.&lt;ref&gt;J. Gordon Harris, Cheryl A. Brown, Michael S. Moore.  &quot;Joshua, Judges, Ruth&quot;. (Peabody: Hendrickson Publishers, 2000), 302.&lt;/ref&gt; This inclusivity transcends cultural or racial boundaries, with the objective of uniting the human race, as reflected in the present Jewish liturgies of the Day of Atonement &lt;ref&gt; ''Service of the Synagogue: A new edition of Festival Prayers with an English Translation in Prose and Verse: Day of Atonement'' two volumes, undated, circa 1955-1965, Routledge and Kegan Paul ltd., London &lt;/ref&gt;. Yet Ruth is not any foreigner; she has embraced Israel's religion and way of life. Hence, the aim is unity under God.

2. Loving-kindness living: Boaz and Ruth are models of an altruism for which the word &quot;loving-kindness&quot; has been coined (approximately translating Hebrew  ''[[hesed]]'').  They act in ways enjoined in both Jewish and Christian precepts, that promote the well-being of others.&lt;ref&gt;Katherine D. Sakenfeld. ''Ruth'' (Louisville: John Knox Press, 1999), 11-12.&lt;/ref&gt; . It is also at the same time believably spontaneous and human that Ruth should want to stay with the mother-in-law for whom she had built up an affection, and offer to undertake the back-breaking and humble work of gleaning (Leviticus 23:22) to support them. Boaz is also spontaneously kind in a way that is both humane and righteous. He enables Ruth to obtain more from her gleaning without offering the embarrassment of direct donation. Though no doubt also motivated by an affection towards Ruth, in marrying her he has to pay a cost in money and uncertainty. The nearer kinsman does not rise to these qualities.

3. God's providential care. Though Naomi was a destitute widow at the time she re-entered Bethlehem, yet by the end of the narrative, we see her embracing her grandson as her foster-child. From empty in chapter 1, she is filled again by God at the end of chapter 4. There is a parallel with the entry of Mary and Joseph, homeless, into the same town, Bethlehem, before the birth of Jesus. God's providential care also extends to Ruth. This is especially seen in chapter 2. Even though the author of the book states that Ruth &quot;just happens&quot; to find Boaz's field (Ruth 2:3), the reader may be led to accede to the notion that in Bible terms there is no mere chance, but that chance and God's providence amount to the same thing. By both chance and providence, Ruth, a destitute, widowed and childless outsider, becomes an ancestress of King David (Ruth 4:13).

4. Integrity: The book highlights the virtue of maintaining integrity in one's life. The example of Boaz, who is of high stature not only based on his  wealth, but also based on his benevolence. His standing is underlined by his authoritativeness during the legal proceedings at the town gate (4:1-10). His integrity is also demonstrated on the threshing floor, when Ruth &quot;visits&quot; Boaz at night. Many scholars debate over what happened on the threshing floor; yet it seems unlikely Boaz and Ruth had sexual relations based on the narrative's portrayal of their character (esp. 2:1; 3:11). Establishing their good character then tarnishing it does not seem likely.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel I. Block. &quot;The New American Commentary: Judges, Ruth.&quot; (Nashville: B&amp;H Publishing Group, 1999), 686.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Tanakh OT}}
The '''Book of Esther''' is one of the books of the [[Hebrew Bible]].  The ''Book of Esther'' or the '''Megillah''' is the basis for the [[Jewish]] celebration of [[Purim]]. Its full text is read aloud twice during the celebration, in the evening and again the following morning.

==Setting==
The biblical ''Book of Esther'' is set in the third year of [[Ahasuerus]], a king of Persia. The name Ahasuerus is equivalent to Xerxes, both deriving from the Persian Khashayarsha, thus Ahasuerus is usually identified as [[Xerxes I]] (486-465 BCE), though [[Ahasuerus]] is identified as [[Artaxerxes]] in the later Greek version of Esther (as well as by [[Josephus]], the Jewish commentary  [[Esther Rabbah]], the Ethiopic translation and the Christian theologian [[Bar-Hebraeus]] who identified him more precisely as [[Artaxerxes II]] &lt;ref&gt;''E A W Budge, ''The Chronography of Bar Hebraeus'', Gorgias Press LLC, reprinted 2003&lt;/ref&gt;). The Book of Esther tells a story of palace intrigue and [[genocide]] thwarted by a Jewish queen of Persia.

==Plot summary==
{{Books of the Old Testament}}
Ahasuerus, ruler of a massive Persian empire, holds a lavish party, initially for his court and dignitaries and afterwards for all inhabitants of the capital city [[Susa|Shushan]]. Ahasuerus orders the queen [[Vashti]] to display her beauty before the guests. She refuses. Worried all women will learn from this, Ahasuerus removes her as queen and has a royal decree sent across the empire that men should be the ruler of their households and should speak their own native tongue. Ahasuerus then orders all &quot;beautiful young girls to be presented to him, so he can choose a new queen to replace Vashti. One of these is [[Esther]], who had no parents and is being fostered by her cousin [[Mordechai]]. She finds favor in the king's eyes, and is made his new queen. Esther does not reveal that she is Jewish. Shortly afterwards, Mordechai discovers a plot by courtiers Bigthan and Teresh to assassinate Ahasuerus. They are apprehended and hanged, and Mordechai's service to the king is recorded.

Ahasuerus appoints [[Haman]] as his prime minister. Mordechai, who sits at the palace gates, falls into Haman's disfavor as he refuses to bow down to him. Having found out that Mordechai is Jewish, Haman plans to kill not just Mordechai but all the Jews in the empire. He obtains Ahasuerus' permission to execute this plan, against payment of ten thousand [[talent (measurement)|talent]]s of silver, and he casts lots to choose the date on which to do this—the thirteenth of the month of [[Adar]]. On that day, everyone in the empire is free to massacre the Jews and despoil their property.  When Mordechai finds out about the plans he and all Jews mourn and fast. Mordechai informs Esther what has happened and tells her to intercede with the King. She is afraid to break the law and go to the King unsummoned. This action would incur the death penalty. Mordechai tells her that she must. She orders Mordechai to have all Jews fast for three days together with her, and on the third day she goes to Ahasuerus, who stretches out his sceptre to her which shows that she is not to be punished. She invites him to a feast in the company of Haman. During the feast, she asks them to attend a further feast the next evening. Meanwhile, Haman is again offended by Mordechai and consults with his friends.  At his wife's suggestion, he builds a [[gallows]] for Mordechai. 

That night, Ahasuerus suffers from insomnia, and when the court records are read to him to help him sleep, he learns of the services rendered by Mordechai in the previous plot against his life. Ahasuerus is told that Mordechai has not received any recognition for saving the king's life. Just then, Haman appears, to ask the King to hang Mordechai, but before he can make this request, King Ahasuerus asks Haman what should be done for the man that the king wishes to honor. Thinking that the man that the king is referring to is himself, Haman says that the man should be dressed in the king's royal robes and led around on the king's royal horse, while a [[herald]] calls:  &quot;See how the king honours a man he wishes to reward!&quot; To his horror and surprise, the king instructs Haman to do so to Mordechai. After leading Mordechai's parade, he returns in mourning to his wife and friends, who suggest his downfall has begun.

Immediately after, Ahasuerus and Haman attend Esther's second banquet, at which she reveals that she is Jewish and that Haman is planning to exterminate her people, including her. Overcome by rage, Ahasuerus leaves the room; meanwhile Haman stays behind and begs Esther for his life, falling upon her in desperation. The king comes back in at this moment and thinks Haman is assaulting the queen; this makes him angrier than before and he orders Haman hanged on the gallows that Haman had prepared for Mordechai. The previous decree against the Jews cannot be annulled, but the king allows the Jews to defend themselves during attacks. As a result, on 13 Adar, five hundred attackers and Haman's ten sons are killed in Shushan, followed by a Jewish slaughter of seventy-five thousand Persians, although they took no plunder. Esther sends a letter instituting an annual commemoration of the Jewish people's redemption, in a holiday called Purim (lots). Ahasuerus remains very powerful and continues reigning, with Mordechai assuming a prominent position in his court. &lt;ref&gt;Esther chapters 9-10&lt;/ref&gt;

==Authorship and date==
[[Image:Göttingen-Esther.Rolle.0.JPG|thumb|right|Scroll of Esther (Megillah)]]''Esther'' is usually dated to the third or fourth century BCE. Jewish tradition regards it as a [[redaction]] by the [[Great Assembly]] of an original text written by [[Mordecai]].&lt;ref&gt;Babylonian Talmud: Tractate Baba Bathra 15a&lt;/ref&gt;

The Greek additions to Esther (which do not appear in the Jewish/Hebrew; see  &quot;Additions to Esther&quot; below) are dated to around the late 2nd century or early 1st BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Freedman, David Noel; Allen C. Myers; Astrid B. Beck ''Eerdmans Dictionary of the Bible

*The primary source relating to the origin of Purim is the ''Megillat Esther'' (Book of Esther), which became the last of the 24 books of the [[Tanakh]] to be canonized by the Sages of the [[Great Assembly]]. It is dated to the 4th century BCE&lt;ref&gt;NIV Study Bible, ''Introductions to the Books of the Bible, Esther'', Zondervan, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; and according to the Talmud was a redaction by the Great Assembly of an original text by Mordecai.&lt;ref&gt;''Babylonian Talmud: Tractate Baba Bathra'' 15a&lt;/ref&gt;

*The Greek Book of Esther, included in the Septuagint, is a retelling of the events of the Hebrew Book of Esther rather than a translation and records additional traditions, in particular the identification of Ahasuerus with [[Artaxerxes]] and details of various letters. It is dated to the second to first century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;George Lyons, ''Additions to Esther'', Wesley Center for Applied Theology, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; The Coptic and Ethiopic versions of Esther are translations of it instead of the Hebrew Esther.

*A Latin version of Esther was produced by [[Jerome]] for the [[Vulgate]]. It translates the Hebrew Esther but interpolates translations of the Greek Esther where the latter provides additional material.

*Several Aramaic [[targum]]s of Esther were produced in the Middle Ages of which two survive - the ''Targum Rishon'' (&quot;First Targum&quot;) and ''Targum Sheni'' (&quot;Second Targum&quot;)&lt;ref name=&quot;Sokoloff&quot;&gt;Prof. Michael Sokoloff, ''The Targums to the Book of Esther'', Bar-Ilan University 's Parashat Hashavua Study Center, Parashat Tezaveh/Zakhor 5764 March 6, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kaufman&quot;&gt;S.

==Historicity==

The book of Esther falls under the category of Writings, one of three parts of the Jewish canon.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coogan, Michael David Coogan 2009&quot;&gt;Coogan, Michael David Coogan, A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament: The Hebrew Bible in Its Context (New York: Oxford University Press, 2009), 396.&lt;/ref&gt; Some modern scholars suggest the book of Esther to be a historical novella.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coogan, Michael David Coogan 2009&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sidnie White Crawford 2003&quot;&gt;Sidnie White Crawford, “Esther,” in The New Interpreters Study Bible New Revised Standard Version with the Apocrypha, ed. Walter J. Harrison and Donald Senior (Nashville: Abingdon Press, 2003), 689-690.&lt;/ref&gt; That is, while the events may not be historically accurate the book itself was written to tell a story of a time in history, in this case the origin of the Jewish holiday of Purim.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coogan, Michael David Coogan 2009&quot;/&gt;

There are a number of reasons some scholars question the historicity of the book of Esther. As noted by biblical scholar Michael D. Coogan, the book of Esther contains specific details regarding certain subject matter (for example, Persian rule) which are historically inaccurate. Coogan also discusses an apparent inaccuracy regarding the age of Esther’s cousin, or, according to others, uncle, Mordecai. In Esther chapter 2, Mordecai is identified as having been exiled from Jerusalem to Babylon by King Nebuchadnezzar in 597 BCE (Esther 2:6).&lt;ref name=&quot;Coogan, Michael David Coogan 2009&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sidnie White Crawford 2003&quot;/&gt; If this were the case, Mordecai would have had to live over a century to have witnessed the events described in the book of Esther.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coogan, Michael David Coogan 2009&quot;/&gt; However, the verse is alternately read as referring not to Mordecai as being exiled to Babylon, but to his great grandfather, Kish.&lt;ref&gt;New King James Version, translation of [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=esther%202:6&amp;version=NKJV Esther 2:6]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ISBE&quot;&gt;Bromiley, Geoffrey W. (Editor), ''International Standard Bible Encyclopedia, Volume II'', 1982, Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co. [http://books.google.com/books?id=yklDk6Vv0l4C&amp;pg=PA159&amp;lpg=PA159&amp;dq=kish+mordecai+antecedent&amp;source=bl p. 159 (entry: Book of Esther)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wiersbe,Warren W., [http://books.google.com/books?id=DUCs8HJTmhEC ''Bible Exposition Commentary: Old Testament History''], David C Cook, 2004 p. 712 &lt;/ref&gt; 

In her article “The Book of Esther and Ancient Storytelling,” biblical scholar Adele Berlin discusses the reasoning behind scholarly concern of the historicity of Esther. Much of this debate relates to the importance of distinguishing history and fiction within biblical texts, as Berlin argues, in order to gain a more accurate understanding of the history of the Israelite people.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adele Berlin 2001&quot;&gt;Adele Berlin, “The Book of Esther and Ancient Storytelling,” Journal of Biblical Literature 120. no. 1 (Spring 2001): 3-14.&lt;/ref&gt; Berlin quotes a series of scholars who suggest that the author of Esther did not mean for the book to be considered as a historical writing, but intentionally wrote it to be a historical novella.&lt;ref&gt;Adele Berlin, “The Book of Esther and Ancient Storytelling,” Journal of Biblical Literature 120. no. 1 (Spring 2001): 6.&lt;/ref&gt; The genre of novellas under which Esther falls was common during both the Persian and Hellenistic periods to which scholars have dated the book of Esther.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coogan, Michael David Coogan 2009&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Adele Berlin 2001&quot;/&gt;

There are certain elements of the book of Esther that are historically accurate. The story told in the book of Esther takes place during the rule of Ahasuerus, who has been identified as the fifth-century Persian king Xerxes (486-465). The author also displays an accurate knowledge of Persian customs and palaces.&lt;ref name=&quot;ISBE&quot;/&gt; However, according to Coogan, considerable historical inaccuracies remain throughout the text, supporting the view that the book of Esther is to be read as a historical novella which tells a story describing historical events but is not necessarily historical fact.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coogan, Michael David Coogan 2009&quot;/&gt;

==Historical reading==
Those arguing in favour of an historical reading of Esther, most commonly identify Ahasuerus with [[Artaxerxes II]] (ruled 405–[[359 BC|359 BCE]]) although in the past it was often assumed that he was [[Xerxes I]] (ruled 486–[[465 BC|465 BCE]]). The [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] ''Ahasuerus'' is most likely derived from [[Persian language|Persian]] ''Khshayarsha'', the origin of the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''Xerxes''. The Greek historian [[Herodotus]] wrote that Xerxes sought his [[Harem (household)|harem]] after being defeated in the [[Greco-Persian Wars]]. He makes no reference to individual members of the harem except for a domineering [[Queen consort]] named [[Amestris]], whose father, Otanes, was a daughter of one of Xerxes's generals. (In contrast, the Greek historian [[Ctesias]] refers to a similar father-in-law/general figure named Onaphas.) Amestris has often been identified with [[Vashti]], but this identification is problematic, as Amestris remained a powerful figure well into the reign of her son, [[Artaxerxes I]], whereas Vashti is portrayed as dismissed in the early part of Xerxes's reign. Alternative attempts have been made to identify her with [[Esther]], although Esther is an orphan whose father was a Jew named Abihail. 

As for the identity of Mordecai, the similar names ''Marduka'' and ''Marduku'' have been found as the name of officials in the Persian court in thirty texts from the period of Xerxes I and his father Darius, and may refer to up to four individuals, one of which might after all be Mordecai.

The Septuagint version of Esther translates the name Ahasuerus as ''Artaxerxes'', a Greek name derived from the [[Persian language|Persian]] ''Artakhshatra''. [[Josephus]] too relates that this was the name by which he was known to the Greeks, and the [[Midrash]]ic text, ''Esther Rabba'' also makes the identification. [[Bar-Hebraeus]] identified Ahasuerus explicitly as [[Artaxerxes II of Persia|Artaxerxes II]]. However, the names are not necessarily equivalent: Hebrew has a form of the name ''Artaxerxes'' distinct from ''Ahasuerus'', and a direct Greek rendering of ''Ahasuerus'' is used by both Josephus and the Septuagint for occurrences of the name outside the Book of Esther. Instead, the Hebrew name Ahasuerus accords with an inscription of the time that notes that Artaxerxes II was named also ''Arshu'', understood as a shortening of ''Achshiyarshu'' the Babylonian rendering of the Persian ''Khshayarsha'' (Xerxes), through which the Hebrew ''Achashverosh'' (Ahasuerus) is derived.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hosch&quot;&gt;Jacob Hoschander, ''The Book of Esther in the Light of History'', Oxford University Press, 1923&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ctesias]] related that Artaxerxes II was also called ''Arsicas'' which is understood as a similar shortening with the Persian suffix ''-ke'' that is applied to shortened names. [[Deinon]] related that Artaxerxes II was also called ''Oarses'' which is also understood to be derived from ''Khshayarsha''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hosch&quot;/&gt;

Another view attempts to identify him instead with [[Artaxerxes I of Persia|Artaxerxes I]] (ruled 465–[[424 BC|424 BCE]]), whose Babylonian concubine, [[Kosmartydene]], was the mother of his son [[Darius II of Persia|Darius II]] (ruled 424–[[405 BC|405 BCE]]). Jewish tradition relates that Esther was the mother of a King Darius and so some try to identify Ahasuerus with Artaxerxes I and Esther with Kosmartydene.

Based on the view that the Ahasuerus of the ''[[Book of Tobit]]'' is identical with that of the ''Book of Esther'', some have also identified him as Nebuchadnezzar's ally [[Cyaxares]] (ruled 625–[[585 BC|585 BCE]]). In certain manuscripts of Tobit, the former is called ''Achiachar'', which, like the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''Cyaxares'', is thought to be derived from [[Persian language|Persian]] ''Akhuwakhshatra''. Depending on the interpretation of ''Esther'' 2:5–6, Mordecai or his great-grandfather Kish was carried away from [[Jerusalem]] with [[Jeconiah]] by [[Nebuchadnezzar II of Babylon|Nebuchadnezzar]], in [[597 BC|597 BCE]]. The view that it was Mordecai would be consistent with the identification of Ahasuerus with Cyaxares. Identifications with other Persian monarchs have also been suggested.

Jacob Hoschander has argued that evidence of the historicity of Haman and his father Hamedatha is seen in ''Omanus'' and ''Anadatus'' mentioned by [[Strabo]] as being honoured with Anahita in the city of [[Zile|Zela]]. Hoschander argues that these were not deities as Strabo supposed but garbled forms of &quot;Haman&quot; and &quot;Hamedatha&quot; who were being worshipped as martyrs. The names are indeed unattested in Persian texts as gods, however the Talmud (''Sanhedrin'' 61b) and [[Rashi]] both record a practice of deifying Haman and Josephus speaks of him being worshipped. &lt;ref name=&quot;Hosch&quot;/&gt; Attempts have been made to connect both &quot;Omanus&quot; and &quot;Haman&quot; with the Zoroastrian term [[Vohu Mana]]; however this denotes the principle of &quot;Good Thoughts&quot; and is not the name of a deity.)

Whenever the book was written and whatever the historicity of the events recounted in it, clearly by the time it was written the term &quot;Yehudim&quot; (יהודים - Jews) already gained a meaning quite close to what it means up to the present—i.e. an ethnic-religious group, scattered in many countries, organised in autonomous communities and the target of intense hatred by fanatic groups.

==Allegorical reading==
{{Expand section|date=May 2008}}
There are many classical Jewish readings of allegories into the book of Esther, mostly from Hasidic sources.  They say that the literal meaning is true but that hidden behind this historical account are many allegories.

Though God is never explicitly mentioned in the Book of Esther, some Christians believe that his influence during the story is implied.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.discoverymagazine.com/digger/d01dd/d0112dd.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Christian readers consider this story to contain an allegory, representing the interaction between the church as 'bride' and [[God]].  This reading is related to the allegorical reading of the [[Song of Solomon]] and to the theme of the Bride of God, which in Jewish tradition manifests as the [[Shekinah]].

==Relation to the rest of the Bible==
''Esther'' is the only book of the [[Tanakh]] that is not represented among the [[Dead Sea scrolls]].  It has often been compared to the first half of the [[Book of Daniel]] and to the [[Biblical apocrypha|deuterocanonical]] Books of [[Book of Tobit|Tobit]] and [[Book of Judith|Judith]] for its subject matter.

The story is also the first time that the word Jew (יְהוּדִי) was used, thus denoting a  distinction between the Hebrews, the Israelites, and their Jewish descendants in the diaspora. Moreover, whatever the historical validity of the specific events depicted, the book clearly reflects a situation in which Jews were an ethnic-religious minority - scattered in many countries, organised in self-contained, self-governing communities and subjected to intensive and sometimes violent hatred by some members of the surrounding society. Clearly, whenever the book was actually composed, a phenomenon which can already be identified as a kind of [[antisemitism]] was in existence - whether or not Haman is an actual historical character.

==Additions to ''Esther''==
{{Wikisource|Bible (King James)/Rest_of_Esther|The King James Version of Rest_of_Esther}}
Additional six chapters appear interspersed in ''Esther'' in the [[Septuagint]], the Greek translation, which then was noted by [[Jerome]] in compiling the Latin [[Vulgate]]; additionally, the Greek text contains many small changes in the meaning of the main text. Jerome recognized them as additions not present in the [[Tanakh|Hebrew Text]] and placed them at the end of his Latin translation as chapters 10:4-16:24. However, some modern Catholic English Bibles restore the Septuagint order, such as [http://www.usccb.org/nab/bible/index.shtml#esther Esther] in the [[New American Bible|NAB]].

These additions include:&lt;ref&gt;see [http://www.usccb.org/nab/bible/index.shtml#esther the NAB online] for the passages&lt;/ref&gt; 
* an opening prologue that describes a dream had by Mordecai
* the contents of the decree against the Jews
* prayers for God's intervention offered by Mordecai and by Esther
* an expansion of the scene in which Esther appears before the king, with a mention of God's intervention
* a copy of the decree in favor of the Jews
* a passage in which Mordecai interprets his dream (from the prologue) in terms of the events that followed

By the time ''Esther'' was written, the foreign power visible on the horizon as a future threat to Judah was the [[Macedon]]ians of [[Alexander the Great]], who defeated the Persian empire about 150 years after the time of the story of Esther; the [[Septuagint]] version noticeably calls Haman a &quot;bully&quot; (βουγαῖον) where the Hebrew text describes him as an [[Agagite]].

The canonicity of these Greek additions has been a subject of scholarly disagreement practically since their first appearance in the [[Septuagint]] –- [[Martin Luther]], being perhaps the most vocal [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]-era critic of the work, considered even the original Hebrew version to be of very doubtful value.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} Luther's complaints against the book carried past the point of scholarly critique and may reflect Luther's antisemitism, which is disputed, such as in the biography of Luther by Derek Wilson, which points out that Luther's anger at the Jews was not at their race but at their theology.

The [[Council of Trent]], the summation of the [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[Counter-Reformation]], declared the entire book, both Hebrew text and Greek additions, to be canonical. While modern Roman Catholic scholars openly recognize the Greek additions as clearly being additions to the text, the ''Book of Esther'' is used twice in commonly used sections of the Catholic [[Lectionary]]. In both cases, the text used is not only taken from a Greek addition, the readings also are the prayer of [[Mordecai]], and nothing of [[Esther]]'s own words is ever used. The [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] uses the Septuagint version of ''Esther'', as it does for all of the Old Testament. The additions are specifically listed in the [[Thirty-Nine Articles]], Article VI, of the [[Church of England]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.episcopalian.org/pbs1928/articles/AnglicanTeaching/041.htm Article VI: OF THE SUFFICIENCY OF THE HOLY SCRIPTURES FOR SALVATION]&lt;/ref&gt;: &quot;The rest of the Book of Esther&quot;.


Esther Rabbah includes all of ''Additions to Esther'' save the &quot;letter texts&quot;. It is these &quot;letter texts&quot; that contain the ahistorical assertions that Haman was a Greek.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}}

==Reinterpretations of the story==
The 2006 film ''[[One Night with the King]]'' is a reenactment of the biblical story of Esther.

The classic 1960 Hollywood film version of the story, ''[[Esther and the King]]'' was directed by [[Raoul Walsh]] starring [[Joan Collins]] and [[Richard Egan (actor)|Richard Egan]].

In 1992 a 30-minute, fully animated video, twelfth in [[Hanna-Barbera]]'s bestselling ''[[The Greatest Adventure: Stories from the Bible|The Greatest Adventure]]'' series, titled ''Queen Esther'' features the voices of [[Helen Slater]] as Queen Esther, [[Dean Jones (actor)|Dean Jones]] as King Ahasuerus, [[Werner Klemperer]] as Haman, and [[Ron Rifkin]] as Mordecai.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.booksofthebible.com/p1958.html Hanna-Barbera's Greatest Adventure Series Videos – Queen Esther]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earthling.com/cgi-bin/google.fcgi/itemKey=1923000071 The Greatest Adventure Stories From The Bible]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several paintings depicting Esther, including one by [[John Everett Millais|Millais]].

''[[VeggieTales]]'' also made an animated version entitled ''[[Esther… The Girl Who Became Queen]]''.

The '''[[railway]] system in [[Great Britain]]''' is the oldest in the world, with the world's first locomotive-hauled public railway opening in 1825. As of 2006, it consists of {{convert|16264|km|mi}} of [[standard gauge]] lines (the [[List of countries by rail transport network size|16th largest in the world]]), of which {{convert|5361|km|mi}} are [[Railway electrification in Great Britain|electrified]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/uk.html United Kingdom: Transport] from the [[CIA World Factbook]] 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; These lines range from [[single track (rail)|single]] to [[double track|double]], triple, [[quadruple track]] and up to twelve tracks. In addition, a number of [[British narrow gauge railways|narrow gauge lines]] operate in parts of the country. The British railway network is connected with that of [[continental Europe]] by an undersea rail link, the [[Channel Tunnel]], which opened in 1994. Despite its track length, it is one of the busiest railways in Europe with 20% more train services than France, 60% more than Italy and more than Spain, Switzerland, The Netherlands, Portugal and Norway combined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url= http://www.networkrailmediacentre.co.uk/Content/Detail.aspx?ReleaseID=5022&amp;NewsAreaID=2&amp;SearchCategoryID=2 |publisher =Network Rail |title= Nine out of ten trains arrive on time during January |date =18 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical overview==
{{Main|History of rail transport in Great Britain}}

[[Image:GBR rail passenegers by year.gif|thumb|right|350px|Rail passenger numbers in Great Britain, 1920-2007]]

The system was originally built as a patchwork of local rail links operated by small private railway companies. Over the course of the 19th and early 20th centuries, these amalgamated or were bought by competitors until only a handful of larger companies remained (see [[railway mania]]). The entire network was brought under government control during the [[World War I|First World War]] and a number of advantages of amalgamation and planning were revealed. However, the government resisted calls for the [[nationalization|nationalisation]] of the network (first proposed by [[William Ewart Gladstone]] as early as the 1830s). Instead, from 1 January 1923, almost all the remaining companies were [[Railways Act 1921|grouped]] into the &quot;big four&quot;, the [[Great Western Railway]], the [[London and North Eastern Railway]], the [[London, Midland and Scottish Railway]] and the [[Southern Railway (UK)|Southern Railway]] companies (there were also a number of other [[joint railway]]s such as the [[Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway]] and the [[Cheshire Lines Committee]] as well as special joint railways such as the [[Forth Bridge]] Railway, [[Ryde Pier]] Railway and at one time the [[East London Railway]]). The &quot;Big Four&quot; were joint-stock public companies and they continued to run the railway system until 31 December 1947.

The growth in road transport during the 1920s and 1930s greatly reduced revenue for the rail companies. Rail companies accused the government of favouring road haulage through the subsidised construction of roads. The railways entered a slow decline owing to a lack of investment and changes in transport policy and lifestyles. During the [[World War II|Second World War]] the companies' managements joined together, effectively forming one company. A maintenance backlog developed during the war and the private sector only had two years to deal with this after the war ended. After 1945, for both practical and ideological reasons, the government decided to bring the rail service into the [[public sector]].
[[Image:Beeching2 clear.svg|thumb|left| What the rail network would have looked like if the Beeching Axe II plans had been implemented]]
From the start of 1948, the &quot;big four&quot; were [[nationalization|nationalised]] to form [[British Railways]] (latterly &quot;British Rail&quot;) under the control of the [[British Transport Commission]]. Although BR was a single entity, it was divided into six (later five) regional authorities in accordance with the existing areas of operation. Though there were few initial changes to the service, usage increased and the network became profitable. Regeneration of track and stations was completed by 1954. In the same year, changes to the British Transport Commission, including the privatisation of road haulage, ended the coordination of transport in Great Britain. Rail revenue fell and in 1955 the network again ceased to be profitable. The mid-1950s saw the rapid introduction of diesel and electric rolling stock but the expected transfer back from road to rail did not occur and losses began to mount.

The desire for profitability led to a major reduction in the network during the mid-1960s with [[Imperial Chemical Industries|ICI]] manager Dr. [[Richard Beeching]] given the task by the government of re-organising the railways. Many branch lines were closed because they were deemed uneconomic (&quot;the [[Beeching Axe]]&quot;), removing much feeder traffic from main line passenger services. The closure of many freight depots that had been used by larger industries such as [[coal]] and [[iron]] led to much freight transferring to road haulage. Beeching was going to close all but the &quot;major trunk routes&quot; in the Beeching II report. This was never implemented by BR.

Passenger services experienced a renaissance with the introduction of [[high speed rail|high-speed]] inter-city trains in the 1970s. Passenger levels have fluctuated since this time, increasing during periods of economic growth and falling during recessions. The 1980s saw severe cuts in government funding and above-[[inflation]] increases in fares and the service became more cost-effective {{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}. In the early 1990s, the five geographical Regions were replaced by a Sector organisation, where passenger services were organised into Inter City, Network SouthEast and Other Provincial Services sectors. This new organisation showed promise of being a more efficient organisation of the railways but within a couple of years of its implementation the structure was fragmented by the [[privatisation]] process.

[[Privatisation of British Rail|Railway operations were privatised]] during 1994-1997. Ownership of the track and infrastructure passed to [[Railtrack]], whilst passenger operations were franchised to individual private sector operators (originally there were 25 franchises) and the freight services sold outright (six companies were set up, but five of these were sold to the same buyer). The government claimed that privatisation would see an improvement in passenger services. Passenger levels have increased in the last decade to the level they had been at in the late-1940s.

The public image of rail travel was severely damaged following the series of significant accidents after privatisation. These included the [[Hatfield rail crash|Hatfield accident]], caused by a rail fragmenting due to the development of microscopic cracks. Following the Hatfield accident, the rail infrastructure company Railtrack imposed over 1,200 emergency speed restrictions across its network and instigated an extremely costly nationwide track replacement programme. The consequent severe operational disruption to the national network and the company's spiralling costs set in motion the series of events which resulted in the ultimate collapse of the company and its replacement with [[Network Rail]], a state-regulated,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.networkrail.co.uk/aspx/717.aspx|title=Our Legal and Financial Structure: How are we regulated|publisher=Network Rail|accessdate=25 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; not-for-dividend company.

At the end of September 2003, the first part of [[High Speed 1]], a high speed link to the [[Channel Tunnel]] and on to [[France]] and [[Belgium]], was completed, significantly adding to the rail infrastructure of the country. The rest of the link, from north Kent to [[St Pancras railway station]] in London, opened in 2007. A major programme of remedial work on the [[West Coast Main Line]] started in 1997 and finished in 2009, far over budget (£10bn), many years late and still not bringing the line up to the standards originally proposed by Railtrack.

Passenger services in Great Britain are divided into regional franchises and run by [[Train Operating Companies]]. These companies bid for seven to eight year contracts to run individual franchises, most contracts are awarded by the [[Department for Transport]] (DfT), with the expiation of [[Merseyrail]], where the franchise is awarded by [[Merseyside Passenger Transport Executive]] and [[ScotRail]] where the DfT awards on the advice of the [[Scottish Government]]. Initially, there were twenty-five franchises, but the number of different operating companies is smaller as some firms, including [[First Group]], [[National Express Group]] and [[Stagecoach Group]], run multiple franchises. In addition, some franchises have since been combined. There are also a number of local or specialised rail services operated on an 'open access' basis outside the franchise arrangements. Examples include the [[Heathrow Express]] and [[Hull Trains]].

In the 2002&amp;ndash;3 operating year, franchised services provided 976 million journeys totalling 24.7 billion passenger miles of travel, which was an increase over 1986&amp;ndash;7 of 32% in journeys (from 738 million) and 29% in passenger miles (from 30.8 billion). On the other hand, taking a longer term view, the number of journeys in 2002&amp;ndash;3 was lower than for the 1950&amp;ndash;60 period. The passenger kilometres figure, after being a flat from 1965&amp;ndash;1995, surpassed the 1947 figure for the first time in 1998 and continues to rise steeply.

The key index used to assess passenger train performance is the ''Public Performance Measure'' which combines figures for punctuality and reliability. Performance against this metric has been especially poor since mid-2000. From a base of 90% of trains arriving on time in 1998, the measure dipped to 75% in mid 2001 and, by the end of the 2002&amp;ndash;3 period, had recovered to only 80%. However, as of September 2006, the PPM stands at 87.5% after a period of steady increases in the annual moving average since 2003.

[[Image:170506 at Worcester Foregate.jpg|thumb|A [[British Rail class 170|Class 170]] at [[Worcester Foregate Street railway station|Worcester Foregate Street]]. These trains are used for local services throughout the country.]]

The real increase in rail fares, after accounting for [[inflation]] over the 1995&amp;ndash;2004 period, was 4.7%. For some years, Britain has been said to have the highest rail fares in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/politics97/news/08/0828/rail.shtml |publisher =BBC |title= Britain Has Worlds Highest Rail Prices - Survey |year=1997 |work= Politics 97}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the (discounted) annual season ticket from London to Brighton (standard 2nd class) as of January 2010 costs £3,280 for {{convert|54|mi|km}} http://www.southernrailway.com/download/300.3/season-ticket-fares-to-london-victoria/ whilst an annual DB (German) 100 BahnCard, which allows one year's travel on the entire German rail network, costs almost exactly the same (3800 Euros)http://www.bahn.com/i/view/GBR/en/prices/germany/bahncard.shtml.

Average rolling stock age &amp;mdash; thought to be an indicator of passenger comfort &amp;mdash; fell slightly from the third quarter of 2001&amp;ndash;2 to the third quarter of 2003&amp;ndash;4, from 20.7 years old to 19.3 years old.

Although passengers rarely have cause to refer to either document, all travel is subject to the [[National Rail Conditions of Carriage]] and all tickets are valid subject to the rules set out in a number of so-called [[UK railway technical manuals|technical manuals]], which are centrally produced for the network.

==Freight services==
[[File:66583 Chesterfield.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Freightliner Group|Freightliner]] [[British Rail Class 66|Class 66]] pulling coal at [[Chesterfield]], [[Derbyshire]].]]
[[File:66152 Coney Green.jpg|thumb|right|A [[DB Schenker Rail (UK)|DB Schenker]] [[British Rail Class 66|Class 66]] pulling a intermodal train at Coney Green.]]
There are four main freight operating companies, the largest of which is [[DB Schenker]] (formerly the [[English, Welsh and Scottish Railway]] (EWS)). There are also several smaller independent operators including [[Mendip Rail]]. Types of freight carried include ''[[intermodal freight transport|intermodal]]'' &amp;mdash; in essence containerised freight &amp;mdash; and coal, metals, oil, and construction material. Freight services have been in steady decline since the 1950s, although the [[Department for Transport]]'s ''Transport Ten Year Plan'' calls for an 80% increase in rail freight measured from a 2000&amp;ndash;1 base.

Statistics on freight are specified in terms of the weight of freight lifted, and the ''net tonne kilometre'', being freight weight multiplied by distance carried. 87 million tonnes of freight was lifted in the 2002&amp;ndash;3 period, against 138 million tonnes in 1986&amp;ndash;7, a decrease of 37%. 18.7 billion net tonne kilometres (11.4 billion net ton miles) of freight movement were recorded in 2002&amp;ndash;3, against 16.6 billion (10.1 billion) in 1986&amp;ndash;7, an increase of 13%.

A symbolic loss to the rail freight industry in Great Britain was the custom of the [[Royal Mail]], which from 2004 discontinued use of its 49-train fleet, and switching to road haulage after a near 170-year-preference for trains. [[Mail train]]s had long been part of the tradition of the railways in Great Britain, famously celebrated in the film ''[[Night Mail]]'', for which [[W. H. Auden]] wrote the poem of the same name. Although Royal Mail suspended the [[Mail train]] in January 2004, this decision was reversed in December of the same year, and [[British Rail Class 325|Class 325s]] are now used on some routes including between London, Warrington and Scotland.

1995+ the amount of [[freight]] carried on the railways has increased sharply. The railways have become more reliable, and economical. Big Road hauliers such as [[Eddie Stobart LTD]] and [[WH Malcom]] move goods by rail Hauling supplies from [[Asda]] and [[Tesco]]. Morrison also use rail freight, as do M&amp;S and many more retailers. By the year 2015 rail-borne [[Intermodal freight transport|intermodal]] traffic is scheduled to double, and by 2030 the whole of rail freight is expected to double.

[[Freight trains]] in the UK are very fuel efficient compared to the road equivalent, there for the emissions released into the atmosphere is reduced, in fact, the average freight train is 70% more efficient than road transport. The heaviest freight train in the UK, is equivalent to 160 [[lorry]] loads.

UK freight trains are going to get heavier and bigger over the next few years to increase efficiency even more and to attract more freight onto rail.

==High-speed rail==
[[File:WCML ECML Midlands.png|thumb|right|Overview map of the main lines in the UK.]]
{{Main|High-speed rail in the United Kingdom}}

High-speed rail (above 125&amp;nbsp;mph) was first introduced in Great Britain in the 1970s by British Rail. BR had pursued two development projects in parallel, the development of a tilting train technology, the '[[Advanced Passenger Train]]' (APT), and development of a conventional high speed diesel train, the 'High Speed Train' (HST). The APT project was abandoned, but the HST design entered service as the [[British Rail Classes 253, 254 and 255]] trains. The prototype HST, the [[British Rail Class 252]], reached a world speed record for diesel trains of 143.2&amp;nbsp;mph, while the main fleet entered service limited to a service speed of 125&amp;nbsp;mph, and were introduced progressively on main lines across the country, with a rebranding of their services as the ''[[InterCity 125]]''. With electrification of the [[East Coast Main Line]], high speed rail in Great Britain was augmented with the introduction of the [[British Rail Class 91]], intended for passenger service at up to 140&amp;nbsp;mph (225&amp;nbsp;km/h), and thus branded as the ''[[InterCity 225]]''. The Class 91 units were designed for a maximum service speed of 140&amp;nbsp;mph, and running at this speed was trialled with a 'flashing green' signal aspect under the [[UK railway signalling|British signalling system]]. The trains were eventually limited to the same speed as the HST, to 125&amp;nbsp;mph, with higher speeds deemed to require [[Cab signalling]], which as of 2010 was not in place on the normal British railway network (but was used on the Channel Tunnel Rail Link). A final attempt by the nationalised British Rail at High Speed Rail was the cancelled [[InterCity 250]] project in the 1990s for the West Coast Main Line.

The first implementation of high speed rail up to 186&amp;nbsp;mph in regular passenger service in Great Britain was the Channel Tunnel Rail Link (now known as [[High Speed 1]]), when its first phase opened in 2003 linking the British end of the [[Channel Tunnel]] at Folkestone with [[Fawkham Junction]] in Kent. This is used by international only passenger trains for the [[Eurostar]] service, using [[British Rail Class 373]] trains. The line was later extended all the way into [[London St Pancras]] in 2007.

Post privatisation, a plan to upgrade the [[West Coast Main Line]] to speeds of up to 140&amp;nbsp;mph with infrastructure improvements were finally abandoned, although the tilting train [[British Rail Class 390|Class 390]] ''Pendolino'' fleet designed for this maximum speed of service were still built and entered service in 2002, and operates limited to 125&amp;nbsp;mph. Other routes in the UK were upgraded with trains capable of top speeds of up to 125&amp;nbsp;mph running with the introduction between 2000 and 2005 of [[British Rail Class 180|Class 180]] ''Adelante'' DMUs and the [[Bombardier Voyager family]] of DEMUs (Classes 220, 221 and 222).

After the building of the first of a new [[British Rail Class 395]] train fleet for use partly on High Speed 1 and parts of the rest of the UK rail network, the first domestic high speed running over 125&amp;nbsp;mph (to about 141.37&amp;nbsp;mph) begin in December 2009, including a special Olympic Javelin shuttle for the [[2012 Olympics]]. These services are operated by the [[Southeastern (train operating company)|Southeastern]] franchise.

Following several studies and consultations on high speed rail, in 2009 the UK Government formally announced the High Speed 2 project, establishing a company to produce a feasibility study to examine route options and financing for a new high speed railway in the UK. This study began on the assumption that the route would be a new purpose built high speed line, from London to the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]], via [[London Heathrow]], relieving traffic on the [[West Coast Main Line]], and would use conventional high speed rail technology as opposed to [[Maglev (transport)|Maglev]]. The rolling stock would be capable of travelling on the existing [[Network Rail]] infrastructure if required.

For replacement of the domestic fleet of Intercity 125 and 225 trains on the existing national network, the [[Intercity Express Programme]] was announced. In February 2009 it was announced the preferred rolling stock option for this project was the [[Hitachi Super Express]] family of multiple units, expected to enter service in 2013. It was stated by [[Agility Trains]], the consortium building the trains, that they would be capable of a maximum speed of 140&amp;nbsp;mph with &quot;minor modifications&quot;, with the necessary signalling modifications required of the [[Network Rail]] infrastructure in Britain likely to come from the phased roll out of the Europe wide [[European Rail Traffic Management System]] (ERTMS).

As of August 2009 the speeds of the fastest trains operating in Great Britain capable of a top speed of over 125&amp;nbsp;mph were as follows:

==Leasing services==
{{Merge|Rolling Stock Operating Company|discuss=Talk:Rail_transport_in_Great_Britain#Merger_proposal|date=January 2009}}
[[Image:Class 47 railway locomotive - Fragonset Black livery - Virginia Water railway station - 280404.jpg|thumb|Fragonset Railways class 47 railway locomotive, Virginia Water railway station, April 2004]]
At the time of privatisation, the rolling stock of [[British Rail]] was sold either directly to the new operators, as in the case of the freight companies, or to the three ROSCOs ([[Rolling Stock Operating Company|Rolling Stock Operating Companies]]) which lease or hire stock to passenger and freight train operators. Leasing is relatively commonplace in transport, since it enables operating companies to avoid the complication associated with raising sufficient capital to purchase assets; instead, assets are leased and paid for from ongoing revenue. Since 1994 there has been a growth in smaller spot-hire companies that provide rolling stock on short-term contracts. Many of these have grown thanks to the major selling-off of locomotives by the large freight operators, especially EWS.

Unlike other major players in the privatised railway system of Great Britain, the ROSCOs are not subject to close regulation by the economic regulatory authority. They were expected to compete with one another, and they do, although not in all respects.

===Controversy===
Since privatisation in 1995, the ROSCOs have faced criticism from a number of quarters - including passenger train operating companies such as GNER, Arriva and FirstGroup - on the basis that they are acting as an [[oligopoly]] to keep lease prices higher than would be the case in a more competitive market. In 1998, [[Deputy Prime Minister]] [[John Prescott]] asked [[Rail Regulator]] [[John Swift QC]] to investigate the operation of the market and make recommendations. It was believed by many at the time that Prescott favoured much closer regulation of the ROSCOs, perhaps bringing them into the net of contract-specific regulation, i.e. requiring every rolling stock lease to be individually approved by the Rail Regulator before it could be valid. Swift's report did not find major problems with the operation of what was then an infant market, and instead recommended that the ROSCOs sign up to voluntary, non-binding codes of practice in relation to their future behaviour. Prescott did not like this, but he did not have the legislative time allocation to do much about it. Swift's successor as Rail Regulator, [[Tom Winsor]], agreed with Swift and the ROSCOs were happy to go along with codes of practice, coupled with the Rail Regulator's new powers to deal with abuse of dominance and anti-competitive behaviour under the [[Competition Act 1998]]. In establishing these codes, the Rail Regulator made it clear that he expected the ROSCOs to adhere to their spirit as well as their letter. The codes of practice were duly put in place and for the next five years the Rail Regulator received no complaints about ROSCO behaviour.

===White paper 2004===
[[Image:ABU0010.jpg|thumb|right|A Virgin Pendolino Train]]
In July 2004, to the surprise of many, the Department for Transport's White Paper on the future of the railways contained a statement that it was dissatisfied with the operation of the rolling stock leasing market and believed that there may have been excessive pricing on the part of the ROSCOs.

In June 2006, [[Gwyneth Dunwoody]], the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] [[Transport Committee]] chair, called for an investigation into the companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Review of train leasing urged |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/real_story/3434369.stm |date =6 June 2006 |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transport commentator [[Christian Wolmar]] has asserted that the high cost of leasing is due to the way the franchises are distributed to the train operating companies. While the TOCs are negotiating for a franchise they have some freedom to propose different rolling stock options. It is only once they have won the franchise, however, that they start negotiating with the ROSCOs. The ROSCO will know the TOC's requirements and also knows that the TOC has to obtain a fixed mix of rolling stock which puts the train operating company at a disadvantage in its negotiations with the ROSCO. However, Wolmar considers it a mistake to blame the ROSCOs who are simply behaving in the way commercial companies always behave. Ultimately the problem for Wolmar is the system and that is down to the government who are not prepared to seek a more workable solution (On the Wrong Line 289).

===Competition Commission===
{{Update|type=section|date=March 2011}}
On 29 November 2006, following a June 2006 complaint by the [[Department for Transport]] alleging excessive pricing by the ROSCOs, the [[Office of Rail Regulation]] announced that it was minded to refer the operation of the market for passenger rolling stock to the [[Competition Commission]], citing, amongst other factors, problems in the DfT's own franchising policy as responsible for what may be regarded as a dysfunctional market. ORR said it will consult the industry and the public on what to do, and will publish its decision in April 2007. If the ORR does refer the market to the Competition Commission, there may well be a hiatus in investment in new rolling stock whilst the ROSCOs and their parent companies wait to hear what return they will be allowed to make on their train fleets. This could have the [[unintended consequence]] of intensifying the problem of overcrowding on some routes because TOCs will be unable to lengthen their trains or acquire new ones if they need the ROSCOs to co-operate in their acquisition or financing. Some commentators have suggested that such an outcome would be detrimental to the public interest. This is especially striking since the [[National Audit Office (United Kingdom)|National Audit Office]], in its November 2006 report on the renewal and upgrade of the [[West Coast main line]], said that the capacity of the trains and the network will be full in the next few years and advocated train lengthening as an important measure to cope with sharply higher passenger numbers.

The Competition Commission is now conducting an investigation (due to be completed on 25 April 2009) and published provisional findings &lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url= http://www.competition-commission.org.uk/press_rel/2008/aug/pdf/22-08.pdf |publisher=Competition Commission |title=Rolling stock leasing market investigation: Provisional findings |date =7 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; on 7 August 2008.

==Statutory framework==
{{See also|Structure of the rail industry in the United Kingdom}}

Railways in Great Britain are in the private sector, but they are subject to control by central government, and to economic and safety regulation by arms of government.

In 2006, using powers in the [[Railways Act 2005]], the [[Department for Transport]] took over most of the functions of the now wound up [[Strategic Rail Authority]]. The DfT now itself runs competitions for the award of passenger rail franchises, and, once awarded, monitors and enforces the contracts with the private sector franchisees. Franchises specify the passenger rail services which are to be run and the quality and other conditions (for example, the cleanliness of trains, station facilities and opening hours, the punctuality and reliability of trains) which the operators have to meet. Some franchises receive subsidy from the DfT for doing so, and some are cash-positive, which means that the franchisee pays the DfT for the contract. Some franchises start life as subsidised and, over their life, move to being cash-positive.

The other regulatory authority for the privatised railway is the [[Office of Rail Regulation]], which, following the Railways Act 2005, is the combined economic and safety regulator. It replaced the [[Rail Regulator]] on 5 July 2004. The [[Rail Safety and Standards Board]] still exists, however; established in 2003 on the recommendations of a public inquiry, it leads the industry's progress in health and safety matters.

The principal modern railway statutes are:

* [[Railways Act 1993]]'''
* [[Competition Act 1998]] (insofar as it confers competition powers on the Office of Rail Regulation)
* [[Transport Act 2000]]
* [[Railways and Transport Safety Act 2003]]
* [[Railways Act 2005]]

==Local metro and other rail systems==
[[File:Urban rail in the UK.jpg|250px|right]]
{{Main|Rapid transit in the United Kingdom|Commuter rail in the United Kingdom}}
A number of towns and cities have [[rapid transit]] systems. Heavy rail underground technology is used in the [[London Underground|London]] and [[Glasgow subway|Glasgow]] Underground systems. Light rail with underground sections in the city centre exist in [[Tyne and Wear Metro|Tyne and Wear]] and in the [[Docklands Light Railway|London Docklands]]. The light rail systems in [[Nottingham Express Transit|Nottingham]], [[Sheffield Supertram|Sheffield]], [[Manchester Metrolink|Manchester]], [[Tramlink|Croydon]] and the [[Midland Metro|Birmingham/Black Country]] use a combination of street running in the city centres and former conventional rail lines in the suburbs. Blackpool has the one remaining traditional tram system. Monorails, heritage tramways, miniature railways and funiculars also exist in several places. In addition, there are a number of heritage (mainly steam) standard and narrow gauge railways, and a few industrial railways and tramways. Some lines which appear to be heritage operations are actually part of the public transport network; the [[Romney, Hythe and Dymchurch Railway]] in Kent regularly transports schoolchildren.

Most major cities have some form of [[Commuter rail in the United Kingdom|commuter rail network]]. These include [[Belfast]], [[Birmingham]], [[Bristol]], [[Cardiff]], [[Edinburgh]], [[Glasgow]], [[Leeds]], [[Liverpool]], [[London]], [[Manchester]] and [[Sheffield]].

==Railway stations==
[[Image:London Victoria Station frontage.jpg|thumb|right| Facade of [[London Victoria station|London Victoria]]]]

There are some 2,500 [[railway station]]s in use, excluding the [[London Underground]] and other systems not part of the national network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nao.org.uk/idoc.ashx?docId=3b6c1973-efd4-45e6-9b34-34e63016c3f0&amp;version=-1 |title=Maintaining and improving Britain's railway stations |publisher=National Audit Office |month=July |year=2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most date from the [[Victorian era]] and some are located on the edge of [[town centre|town]] and [[city centre]]s. Major stations lie for the most part in large cities, typically with the largest conurbations (e.g. Liverpool, Birmingham, Bristol, Cardiff, Edinburgh, Glasgow and Manchester) boasting more than one main station. London is a major hub of the network, with 12 major main-line terminuses forming a &quot;ring&quot; around the central area. [[Birmingham]], [[Leeds]], Manchester, Glasgow, Bristol and Reading are major interchanges for many cross-country journeys that do not involve London. However, some important railway junction stations lie in smaller cities and towns, for example [[York railway station|York station]], [[Crewe railway station|Crewe station]] and [[Ely railway station|Ely station]]. Other places expanded into towns and cities because of the railway network. [[Swindon]], for example, was little more than a village before the [[Great Western Railway]] chose to site its locomotive works there. In many instances geography, politics or military considerations caused stations to originally be located further from the towns they served until, with time, these issues could be overcome (for example, [[Portsmouth]] had its original station at [[Gosport]]).

Many lines closed by British Railways (including many closed during the [[Beeching cuts]] have been restored and re-opended as [[heritage railway]]s. A few have been relaid as narrowgauge but the majority are standard gauge. Most deploy both steam and diesel locomotives for haulage. The majority of heritage railways are operated as tourist attractions and do not provide regular year-round train services. See also this [[list of British heritage and private railways]].

==Railway re-opening==
Several pressure groups are campaigning for the re-opening of closed railway lines in Great Britain. These include:

From 1995 until 2009, 27 new lines (totalling 199 track miles) and 68 stations were opened, with 65 further new station sites identified by [[Network Rail]] or government for possible construction.&lt;ref name=&quot;ATOCConnectingCommunitiesReportS10&quot;/&gt;

On 15 June 2009 the [[Association of Train Operating Companies]] (ATOC) published the report ''[[Connecting Communities: Expanding Access to the Rail Network]]'', detailing schemes around England where it believed there was a commercial business case for passenger network expansion. The published proposals involved the re-opening or new construction of 40 stations, serving communities with populations of over 15,000, including 14 schemes involving the re-opening or reconstruction of rail lines for passenger services. These would be short-lead-time local projects, to be completed in timescales ranging from 2 years 9 months to 6 years, once approved by [[Local government in England|local]] and [[Regions of England|regional]] governments, Network Rail and the [[Department for Transport]], complementing existing long-term national projects.&lt;ref name=&quot;ATOCConnectingCommunitiesReportS10&quot;&gt;{{Cite web

'''British Railways''' ('''BR'''), which from the 1960s traded as '''British Rail''', was the operator of most of the [[rail transport in Great Britain]] between 1948 and 1997.  It was formed as a result of the [[nationalisation]] of the [[Big Four British railway companies|&quot;Big Four&quot; British railway companies]] and lasted until the gradual [[privatisation of British Rail]] in stages between 1994 and 1997. Originally a trading brand of the Railway Executive of the [[British Transport Commission]], it became an independent [[statutory corporation]] in 1962: the [[British Railways Board]].

The period of nationalisation saw sweeping changes in the national railway network; a process of [[dieselisation]] occurred which saw steam traction eliminated in 1968, in favour of diesel and electric power. Passengers replaced freight as the main source of business and one third of the network was closed by the [[Beeching Axe]] of the 1960s.

The British Rail &quot;double arrow&quot; logo is formed of two interlocked arrows showing the direction of travel on a [[double track]] railway and was nicknamed &quot;the arrow of indecision&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | last = Shannon| first = Paul| title = Blue Diesel Days| work = &lt;!--This webpage is actually a publisher's advert for the book (ISBN 9780711032255), but shows online the usage of the phrase referenced.

===Nationalisation in 1947===

[[Image:cyclinglion.jpg|thumb|175px|right|The &quot;cycling lion&quot; crest, used on locomotives between 1950 and early 1956]]

[[File:British Railways 1956 logotype.jpg|thumb|175px|left|The 1956 &quot;ferret and dartboard&quot; crest, used on locomotives until the Corporate (blue) Livery and logo was introduced]]

The rail transport system in Great Britain developed during the 19th century. After the grouping of 1923 under the [[Railways Act 1921]] there were four large railway companies, each dominating its own geographic area: the [[Great Western Railway]] (GWR), the [[London, Midland and Scottish Railway]] (LMS), the [[London and North Eastern Railway]] (LNER) and the [[Southern Railway (UK)|Southern Railway]] (SR). During [[World War I]] the railways were under state control, which continued until 1921. Complete [[nationalisation]] had been considered, and the [[Railways Act 1921]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite hansard | url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1920/aug/03/the-state-and-the-railways | publisher = [[Hansard]] | house=[[House of Lords]] | date=1920-08-03 | accessdate= 2009-07-18 | column_start=711 | column_end=713 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is sometimes considered as a precursor to that, but the concept was rejected; nationalisation was subsequently carried out after [[World War II]], under the [[Transport Act 1947]]. This Act made provision for the nationalisation of the network, as part of a policy of nationalising public services by [[Clement Attlee]]'s [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] Government. British Railways came into existence as the [[business name]] of the [[Railway Executive]] of the [[British Transport Commission]] (BTC) on 1 January 1948 when it took over the assets of the Big Four.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.railwaysarchive.co.uk/docSummary.php?docID=67| title=Transport Act 1947| author=Her Majesty's Government | year=1947| work=The Railways Archive| publisher=(originally published by Her Majesty's Stationery Office)| accessdate=2006-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were also [[joint railway]]s between the big four and a few light railways to consider - see [[list of constituents of British Railways]]. Excluded from nationalisation were industrial lines like the [[Oxfordshire Ironstone Railway]]; narrow-gauge railways, like the [[Ffestiniog Railway]] were also excluded, apart from two which were already owned by a company which was itself to be nationalised. The London Underground, which had been publicly owned since 1933, was also nationalised, becoming the [[London Transport Executive]] of the British Transport Commission. The [[Bicester Military Railway]] was already run by the government. The electric [[Liverpool Overhead Railway]] was also excluded from nationalisation.

The Railway Executive was conscious that some lines on the (then very dense) network were not profitable and also hard to justify socially, and a modest programme of closures was begun. However, the general financial position of BR became gradually worse, until an operating loss was recorded in 1955. The Executive itself had been abolished in 1953 by the incoming Conservative government, and control of BR transferred directly to the parent Commission. Other changes to the British Transport Commission at the same time included the return of road haulage to the private sector.

===1955 Modernisation Plan===

In 1955, a major [[1955 Modernisation Plan|modernisation programme]] costing £1.2&amp;nbsp;billion was authorised by the government. This included the withdrawal of steam traction and its replacement by diesel (and some electric) locomotives. Not all the modernizations would be effective at reducing costs: many classes of sometimes experimental locomotives were bought, and a number of marshalling yards were built at a time when wagon load freight was already being replaced by train load workings, which do not need complex shunting and reforming.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} 

The report latterly known as the &quot;Modernisation Plan&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.railwaysarchive.co.uk/docSummary.php?docID=23| title=Modernisation and Re-Equipment of British Rail| author=British Transport Commission| publisher=(Originally published by the British Transport Commission)|year=1954| work=The Railways Archive| accessdate=2006-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; was published in December 1954. It was intended to bring the [[Rail transport|railway system]] into the 20th century. A government [[White Paper]] produced in 1956 stated that modernisation would help eliminate BR's financial deficit by 1962. The aim was to increase speed, reliability, safety and line capacity, through a series of measures which would make services more attractive to passengers and freight operators, thus recovering traffic that was being lost to the roads. The important areas were:

* Electrification of principal main lines, in the [[Eastern Region of British Railways|Eastern Region]], [[Kent]], Birmingham and Central [[Scotland]];
* Large-scale [[dieselisation]] to replace [[steam locomotives of British Railways|steam locomotives]];
* New passenger and freight rolling stock;
* Resignalling and track renewal;
* Closure of small number of lines which were seen as unnecessary in a nationalised network, as they duplicated other lines.

===The Beeching report===
[[Image:Beeching2.svg|thumb|right|175px| The national network might have looked like this by the 1980s if the lines that were not proposed as trunk routes had actually closed (the network for development is shown in bold).]]
[[File:British Railways Delivery Truck London 1962.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Scammell Scarab]] truck in [[British Railways]] livery, London, 1962. British Railways had got involved in the road haulage and rail fright bussnesses over the years.]]

During the late 1950s, railway finances continued to worsen, and in 1959 the government stepped in, limiting the amount the BTC could spend without ministerial authority. A White Paper proposing reorganisation was published in the following year, and a new structure was brought into effect by the Transport Act 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.railwaysarchive.co.uk/docSummary.php?docID=116| title=Transport Act 1962| author=Her Majesty's Government | year=1962| work=The Railways Archive| publisher=(originally published by Her Majesty's Stationery Office)| accessdate=2006-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; This abolished the Commission and replaced it by a number of separate Boards. These included a British Railways Board, which took over on 1 January 1963.

Following semi-secret discussions on railway finances by the government-appointed Stedeford Committee in 1961, one of its members, Doctor Richard Beeching, was offered the post of chairing the BTC while it lasted, and then becoming the first Chairman of the British Railways Board.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/history/beeching_prog1.shtml &quot;Back to Beeching&quot;], BBC Radio 4, Thursday 27 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

A major traffic census in April 1961, which lasted one week, was used in the compilation of a report on the future of the network. This report - ''The Reshaping of British Railways'' - was published by the BRB in March 1963 (&quot;the [[Beeching Axe]]&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.railwaysarchive.co.uk/docSummary.php?docID=13| title=The Reshaping of British Railways - Part 1: Report| author=British Transport Commission| year=1963| work=The Railways Archive| publisher=(originally published by Her Majesty's Stationery Office)| accessdate=2006-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.railwaysarchive.co.uk/docSummary.php?docID=35| title=The Reshaping of British Railways - Part 2: Maps| author=British Transport Commission| year=1963| work=The Railways Archive| publisher=(originally published by Her Majesty's Stationery Office)| accessdate=2006-11-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its proposals were dramatic. A third of all passenger services and more than 4000 of the 7000 stations would close. Beeching, who is believed to have been the author of most of the report, set out some dire figures. One third of the network was carrying just 1% of the traffic. Of the 18,000 passenger coaches, 6,000 were said to be used only 18 times a year or less. Although maintaining them cost between £3m and £4m a year, they earned only about £0.5m.&lt;ref&gt;Page 15, &quot;The Reshaping of British Railways&quot;, Dr Richard Beeching&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the closures were carried out between 1963 and 1970 (including a few that were not listed in the report). Some closures originally listed were not carried out. The closures transformed the railway. Freight in particular underwent a revolution as the Victorian network of thousands of small yards was progressively abolished in favour of comparatively few major terminals.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

The closures were heavily criticized at the time,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.railwaysarchive.co.uk/docSummary.php?docID=236 &quot;The Economics and Social Aspects of the Beeching Plan&quot;] - Lord Stoneham, House of Lords, 1963]&lt;/ref&gt; and continue to attract criticism today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://hitchensblog.mailonsunday.co.uk/2009/06/can-beeching-be-undone.html| title=Can Beeching be undone?| year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since privatization, efforts have been made to re-open some of the lines closed under the Beeching program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/8099912.stm &quot;Move to reinstate lost rail lines&quot;], BBC, 15 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

A second Beeching report, ''The Development of the Major Trunk Routes,'' followed in 1965. This did not recommend closures as such, but outlined a &quot;network for development&quot;. The fate of the rest of the network was not discussed in the report.

===Post-Beeching===

The basis for calculating passenger fares changed in 1964. In future, fares on some routes - such as rural, holiday and commuter services - would be set at a higher level than on other routes; previously, fares had been calculated using a simple rate for the distance travelled, which at the time was 3d per mile second class, and {{frac|4|1|2}}d per mile first class&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |editor-first=B.W.C. |editor-last=Cooke |year=1964 |month=July |title=Notes and News: New fares structure |journal=[[Railway Magazine]] |volume=110 |issue=759 |page=592 |publisher=Tothill Press |location=Westminster }}&lt;/ref&gt; (equivalent to £{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|{{#expr: 3 / 240}}|1964|{{CURRENTYEAR}}|r=2}}}} and £{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|{{#expr: 4.5 / 240}}|1964|{{CURRENTYEAR}}|r=2}}}} respectively, as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}{{Inflation-fn|UK}}).

Passenger levels decreased steadily from the late 1950s to late 1970s,&lt;ref&gt;The UK [http://www.dft.gov.uk/stellent/groups/dft_transstats/documents/divisionhomepage/031571.hcsp Department for Transport] (DfT), specifically Table 6.1 from [http://www.dft.gov.uk/stellent/groups/dft_transstats/documents/downloadable/dft_transstats_613483.pdf Transport Statistics Great Britain 2006] (4MB PDF file)&lt;/ref&gt; but experienced a renaissance with the introduction of the high-speed [[Intercity 125]] trains in the late 1970s and early 1980s.&lt;ref name=&quot;BRMP&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Marsden |first=Colin J. |title=British Rail 1983 Motive Power: Combined Volume |year=1983 |publisher=Ian Allen |location=London |isbn=0-7110-1284-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Network improvements included completing electrification of the [[Great Eastern Main Line]] from London to Norwich between 1976 and 1986 and the [[East Coast Main Line]] from London to Edinburgh between 1985 and 1990. A main line route closure during this period of relative network stability was the 1500V DC electrified [[Woodhead Line]], passenger service ceased in 1970 and goods in 1981.

The 1980s saw pressure to reduce government funding and above-[[inflation]] increases in fares.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} A further British Rail report, from a committee chaired by [[David Serpell|Sir David Serpell]], was published in 1983. The [[Serpell Report]] made no recommendations as such, but did set out various options for the network including, at their most extreme, a skeletal system of less than 2000 route km. This report was not welcomed, and even the government decided to quietly leave it on the shelf. Meanwhile, BR was gradually re-organised, with the regional structure finally being abolished and replaced with business-led sectors. This led to far greater customer focus, but was cut short in 1994 with the splitting up of BR for privatisation.

Upon sectorisation in 1982, the passenger sectors created were [[InterCity (British Rail)|InterCity]] (principal express services) and [[Network SouthEast]] (mainly [[London]] [[commuter]] services).&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas&quot;/&gt; Provincial was responsible for all other passenger services, except in the [[metropolitan county|metropolitan counties]], where local services were managed by the [[Passenger Transport Executive]]s. '''Regional Railways''' was one of the three passenger sectors of British Rail created in 1982 that existed until 1996, two years after [[Privatisation of British Rail|privatisation]]. The sector was originally called '''Provincial'''. Regional Railways was the most subsidised (per passenger km) of the three sectors. Upon formation, its costs were four times its [[revenue]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas&quot;&gt;{{cite book | first=David St John | last=Thomas | coauthors=Whitehouse, Patrick | year=1990 | title=BR in the Eighties | publisher= David &amp; Charles | location=Newton Abbot | isbn=0-7153-9854-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The privatisation of British Rail===

Between 1994 and 1997, [[Privatisation of British Rail|British Rail was privatised]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.railwaysarchive.co.uk/docSummary.php?docID=12| title=Railways Act 1993| author=Her Majesty's Government | year=1903| work=The Railways Archive| publisher=(originally published by Her Majesty's Stationery Office)| accessdate=2006-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ownership of the track and infrastructure passed to [[Railtrack]] on 1 April 1994; afterwards passenger operations were franchised to individual private-sector operators (originally there were 25 franchises); and the freight services sold outright (six companies were set up, but five of these were sold to the same buyer).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ews-railway.co.uk/about/history.html |title=EWS Railway - Company History |accessdate=2006-11-26 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060930234359/http://www.ews-railway.co.uk/about/history.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining obligations of British Rail were transferred to [[BRB (Residuary) Ltd.]]

== Network ==

The former BR network, with the trunk routes of the [[West Coast Main Line]], [[East Coast Main Line]], [[Great Western Main Line]] and [[Midland Main Line]], remains mostly unchanged since privatisation. Several lines have reopened and more are proposed, particularly in [[Scotland]] and [[Wales]] where the control of railway passenger services is devolved from central government. However, in England passenger trains have returned to [[Corby railway station|Corby]], [[Chandlers Ford railway station|Chandlers Ford]] reopened line to [[Aylesbury Vale Parkway railway station|Aylesbury Vale Parkway]] and there are numerous other proposals to restore services, such as Oxford-Milton Keynes/Aylesbury, [[Wealden Line|Lewes-Uckfield]] and Plymouth-Tavistock.

[[Image:York station 20041113.jpg|thumb|right|175px|[[York railway station]] on the [[East Coast Main Line]]]]

In Wales, the Welsh Assembly Government successfully supported the re-opening to passenger services, of the [[Vale of Glamorgan Line]] between Barry and Bridgend in 2005. In 2008 the [[Ebbw Valley Railway]] reopened between [[Ebbw Vale Parkway railway station|Ebbw Vale Parkway]] and [[Cardiff Central railway station|Cardiff]], with services to Newport scheduled to commence by 2011. (The Barry-Bridgend route was included in the closures proposed in the Beeching report of March 1963 and its services were duly withdrawn in June 1964, but Ebbw Vale had already been closed to passengers before the report was published.)

In Scotland the Scottish Executive/Government have reinstated the lines between [[Argyle Line#Extensions|Hamilton and Larkhall]], [[Stirling-Alloa-Kincardine rail link|Stirling and Alloa]], and [[Airdrie-Bathgate Rail Link|Airdrie to Bathgate]]. The biggest line reinstatment project is the former [[Waverley Line|Waverley railway]] Edinburgh to Borders line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.waverleyrailwayproject.co.uk/route.php| title=Waverley Rail Project route}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ships==
{{main|British Railways ships}}
British Railways operated a number of ships from its formation in 1948 on a variety of routes. Many ships were acquired on nationalisation, and others were built for operation by British Railways or its later subsidiary, [[Sealink]]. Those ships capable of carrying rail vehicles were classed under [[TOPS]] as [[British Rail Class 99|Class 99]].

== Successor companies ==
{{See also|History of rail transport in Great Britain 1995 to date}}
Under the process of British Rail's privatisation, operations were split into more than 100 companies. The ownership and operation of the infrastructure of the railway system was taken over by [[Railtrack]].&lt;br /&gt;
The Telecomms infrastructure and [[British Rail Telecommunications]] was sold to [[Racal]] which in turn sold onto [[Global Crossing]] and merged with [[Thales Group]].&lt;br /&gt;
The rolling stock was transferred to three private [[ROSCO]]s (ROlling Stock COmpanies). Passenger services were divided into 25 operating companies, which were let on a franchise basis for a set number of years, whilst freight services were sold off completely. Dozens of smaller engineering and maintenance companies were also created and sold off.

British Rail's passenger services came to an end upon the franchising of [[ScotRail]]; the final train that the company operated was a [[Railfreight Distribution]] freight train in Autumn 1997. The British Railways Board continued in existence as a corporation until early 2001, when it was replaced with the [[Strategic Rail Authority]].

Since privatisation, the structure of the rail industry and number of companies has changed a number of times as franchises have been relet and the areas covered by franchises restructured. Franchise-based companies that took over passenger rail services include:

*[[Midland Mainline]] – superseded in 2007 by [[East Midlands Trains]]
*[[Great North Eastern Railway]] – superseded in 2007 by [[National Express East Coast]] which has since been brought back full circle into public ownership with the creation of the new government controlled [[East Coast (train operating company)|East Coast]] operator.
*[[Virgin Trains]] (West Coast)
*[[Virgin CrossCountry]] – superseded in 2007 by [[CrossCountry]]
*[[ScotRail]] ''operated by National Express'' - superseded in 2004 by [[First ScotRail]] (now branded as ''ScotRail - Scotland's Railway'')
*[[Great Western Trains]] – from 1998: [[First Great Western]]
*[[Wales and West]] – became [[Wessex Trains]] and [[Wales and Borders]] (including the [[Cardiff Railway Company]] services operated as Valley Lines) in 2001, after being split into two separate franchises, and now run by [[First Great Western]] and [[Arriva Trains Wales]]
*[[Arriva Trains Northern]] (originally [[Northern Spirit]]) – superseded in 2004 by [[First TransPennine Express]] and [[Northern Rail]]
*[[First North Western]] (originally [[North Western Trains]]) – superseded in 2004 by [[First TransPennine Express]] and [[Northern Rail]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Tanakh OT}}
The '''Book of Job''' (Hebrew: אִיוֹב‎ ''ʾ iyobh'') is one of the books of the [[Hebrew Bible]]. It relates the story of [[Job (Biblical figure)|Job]], who in Jewish tradition is the son of Uz, who was the son of [[Nahor]], the brother of [[Abraham]]. It tells of his trials at the hands of God, his theological discussions with friends on the origins and nature of his suffering, his challenge to God, and finally a response from God. The book comprises a [[Biblical poetry#Didactic poems|didactic poem]] set in a prose frame and has been called &quot;the most profound literary work of the entire Old Testament&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amazon.com/dp/0684819139 John L. McKenzie, Dictionary of the Bible, [[Simon &amp; Schuster]], 1965 p 440.]&lt;/ref&gt; The book and its numerous [[exegeses]] are attempts to address the [[problem of evil]]. The over-riding and oft-asked question manifestly revealed in the book of Job is, &quot;Why do the righteous suffer?&quot; &lt;ref&gt;http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;num=100&amp;q=%22Why+do+the+righteous+suffer%3F%22&lt;/ref&gt;

==Narrative==
The Book tells the story of an extremely pious man named Job, who was very prosperous and had seven sons and three daughters. Constantly fearing that his sons may have sinned and &quot;cursed God in their hearts&quot;, he habitually offered burnt offerings as a pardon for their sins.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Job|1:1-5|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The &quot;[[sons of God]]&quot; and [[Satan]] (literally &quot;the adversary&quot;) present themselves to God. God asks Satan his opinion on Job. Satan answers that Job is pious only because God put a &quot;wall around&quot; him and &quot;blessed&quot; his favorite servant with prosperity. But if God touches &quot;his possessions&quot;, then Job would curse him. God gives Satan permission to test Job's righteousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Job|1:6-12|9}}, King James Bible&lt;/ref&gt;

All of Job's possessions are destroyed and a '[[Spirit#Related_concepts_in_other_languages|ruach]]' (wind/spirit) causes the house of the firstborn to collapse killing all of Job's offspring who were gathered for a feast.&lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;Compare: &lt;br&gt;Ex 12 &lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt;Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and said unto them, Draw out and take you a lamb according to your families, and kill the passover.
&lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt;And ye shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip it in the blood that is in the bason, and strike the lintel and the two side posts with the blood that is in the bason; and none of you shall go out at the door of his house until the morning.
&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt;For the LORD will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when he seeth the blood upon the lintel, and on the two side posts, the LORD will pass over the door, and will not suffer the destroyer to come in unto your houses to smite you...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
...&lt;sup&gt;29&lt;/sup&gt;And it came to pass, that at midnight the LORD smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sat on his throne unto the firstborn of the captive that was in the dungeon; and all the firstborn of cattle.&lt;/ref&gt; Job does not curse God after this but instead shaves his head, tears his clothes and says, &quot;Naked I came out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return: Lord has given, and Lord has taken away; blessed be the name of Lord&quot; (Simplified).&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Job|1:15-22|9}}, King James Bible&lt;/ref&gt;

As Job endures these calamities without reproaching [[Divine Providence]], Satan solicits permission to afflict his person as well, and God says, &quot;Behold, he is in your hand, but don't touch his life.&quot; Satan, therefore, smites him with dreadful [[boil]]s, and Job, seated in ashes, scrapes his skin with broken pottery. His wife prompts him to &quot;curse God, and die&quot; but Job answers, &quot;You speak as one of the foolish speaks. Moreover, shall we receive good from God and shall not receive evil?&quot;

Three friends of Job, Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite, come to console him. And the three of Job's friends heard all this evil that came on him, and they came every man from his place — [[Eliphaz (Job)|Eliphaz]] the [[Teman (Edom)|Temanite]] (Heb: Aliphaz the Thimanite), [[Bildad]]  the [[Shuah|Shuhite]] (Heb: Bildad the Shuchite), and [[Zophar]] [[Naamathite]] (Heb: Zuphar the Nomathite).  A fourth, [[Elihu (Job)|Elihu]] the [[Children of Eber|Buzite]] (Heb: Alieua ben Barakal the Buzite), first begins talking in Chapter 32 and plays a significant role in the dialogue; however, his arrival is not described.  The friends spend seven days sitting on the ground with Job, without saying anything to him because they see that he is suffering and in much pain. Job at last breaks his silence and &quot;curses the day he was born&quot;.

===Structure===
The book of Job has a fairly simple structure. Job 1 and 2 are the prologue, written in prose. Job 3:1-42:6 is poetry that consists of a cycle of speeches between Job, Eliphaz, Bildad, Zophar and later Elihu, and then the dialogue between Yahweh and Job. Job 42:7-14 is the epilogue, which is written in prose.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coogan, M 2009 pp.381&quot;&gt;Coogan, M. A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament: The Hebrew Bible in its Context. (Oxford University Press: Oxford 2009), pp.381.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Speech cycles====
The dialogues of chapters 3-31 are, in general, a cycle of speeches between Job, Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar that are structured as follows:

'''Cycle 1'''&lt;br /&gt;
Job  ''Chapters'' 3&lt;br /&gt;
Eliphaz          4-5&lt;br /&gt;
Job              6-7&lt;br /&gt;
Bildad           8&lt;br /&gt;
Job              9-10&lt;br /&gt;
Zophar           11

'''Cycle 2'''&lt;br /&gt;
Job      ''Chapters'' 12-14&lt;br /&gt;
Eliphaz          15&lt;br /&gt;
Job              16-17&lt;br /&gt;
Bildad           18&lt;br /&gt;
Job              19&lt;br /&gt;
Zophar           20

'''Cycle 3'''&lt;br /&gt;
Job      ''Chapters'' 21&lt;br /&gt;
Eliphaz          22&lt;br /&gt;
Job              23-24&lt;br /&gt;
Bildad           25:1-5&lt;br /&gt;
Job              26; 27-28; 29-31&lt;ref&gt;Coogan, M. A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament: The Hebrew Bible in its Context. (Oxford University Press: Oxford 2009), pp.381&lt;/ref&gt;

The third cycle, it should be noted, does not follow the pattern of the first two cycles. Zophar does not give a speech and Bildad's speech is significantly shorter than his previous speeches.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coogan, M 2009 pp.381&quot;/&gt;

===Speeches of Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar===
Job's friends do not waver from their belief that Job must have sinned to incite God's punishment. As the speeches progress, Job's friends increasingly berate him for refusing to confess his sins, although they themselves are at a loss as to which sin he has committed. They also assume, in their view of theology, that God always rewards good and punishes evil, with no apparent exceptions allowed. There seems to be no room in their understanding of God for divine discretion and mystery in allowing and arranging suffering for purposes other than retribution.  Job's friends never use the name [[YHVH]] in the story; they refer to God as [[El Shaddai]], Eloahh, and Elohiym.

===Speeches of Job===
Job, confident of his own innocence, maintains that his suffering is unjustified as he has not sinned, and that there is no reason for God to punish him thus. However, he does not curse God's name or accuse God of injustice but rather seeks an explanation or an account of his wrong doing.

===Speech of Elihu===
Elihu takes a mediator's path — he attempts to maintain the sovereignty and righteousness and gracious mercy of God. Elihu's speech comes after the final words of Job in the third speech cycle (31:40) and goes from chapters 32-37.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coogan, M 2009 pp.381&quot;/&gt; Elihu strongly condemns the approach taken by the three friends, and argues that Job is misrepresenting God's righteousness and discrediting his loving character. Elihu says he spoke last because he is much younger than the other three friends, but says that age makes no difference when it comes to insights and wisdom. In his speech, Elihu argues for God's power, redemptive salvation, and absolute rightness in all his conduct. God is mighty, yet just, and quick to warn and to forgive. Elihu takes a distinct view of the kind of repentance required by Job.  Job's three friends claim that repentance requires Job to identify and renounce the sins that gave rise to his suffering. By contrast, Elihu stresses that real repentance entails renouncing moral authority, which is God's alone.{{Dubious|date=July 2010}}{{Syn|date=July 2010}}  Elihu therefore underscores the inherent arrogance in Job's  desire to 'make his case' before God, which presupposes that Job possesses a superior moral standard that can be prevailed upon God. Elihu's speeches act as a narrative bridge which joins Job's summary of his case with the appearance of God.&lt;ref&gt;J. Gerald Jansen, ''Job'', Interpretation Bible Commentary, Atlanta: John Knox Press, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; His speech maintains that Job, while righteous, is not perfect. Job does not disagree with this and God does not rebuke Elihu as he does Bildad, Zophar, and Eliphaz.&lt;ref&gt;The absence of comments by Job and by God has been explained with the hypothesis that the speeches of Elihu (chapters 32-37) are later interpolations (see section [[Book_of_Job#Later_interpolations_and_additions|Later interpolations and additions]]).&lt;/ref&gt; After Elihu's speech ends with the last verse of Chapter 37, God appears and in the second verse of Chapter 38, God says, speaking of Job: “Who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge?&quot;

===God's response===
After several rounds of debate between Job and his friends, in a divine voice, described as coming from a &quot;cloud&quot; or &quot;whirlwind&quot;, God describes, in evocative and lyrical language, what the experience of being the creator of the world is like, and [[Rhetorical question|rhetorically]] asks if Job has ever had the experiences or the authority that God has had. God's answer underscores that Job shares the world with numerous powerful and remarkable creatures. (Also compare {{bibleverse||Job|41:18-21|31}} with {{bibleverse||Job|15:12-13|31}} which was possibly in response to {{bibleverse||Job|7:11-16|31}}).

God's speech also emphasizes his sovereignty in creating and maintaining the world. The thrust is not merely that God has experiences that Job does not, but that God is king over the world and is not necessarily subject to questions from his creatures, including men. The point of these speeches, and ultimately the entire book of Job, is to proclaim the absolute freedom of God over His creation. God is not in need of the approval of his creation. Notably, it is only the reader of the book who learns the backstory of God's conversations with Satan; Job himself remains unaware of the reason or source of his sufferings until the end. Finally, humbled by God's chastising, Job turns speechless, giving up and repenting his previous requests of justice.

In the epilogue, God condemns Job's friends for their ignorance and lack of understanding while commending Job for his righteous words, commands them to prepare burnt offerings and reassures them that Job will pray for their forgiveness. Job is restored to health, gaining double the riches he possessed before and having new children, 7 sons and 3 daughters (his wife did not die in this ordeal). His new daughters ([[Jemima (Bible)|Jemima]], [[Keziah]] and [[Keren-Happuch]]&lt;ref&gt;http://niv.scripturetext.com/job/42.htm&lt;/ref&gt;) were the most beautiful in the land, and were given inheritance along with their brothers. Job is blessed once again and lives on another 140 years after the ordeal, living to see his children to the fourth generation and dying peacefully of old age.

==Satan in the Book of Job==
Satan appears in the prose prologue of Job, with Satan's usual connotation of &quot;the adversary&quot;, as a distinct being. He is shown as one of the celestial beings before the deity,&lt;ref name=&quot;Coogan, M. 2001 pp. 728&quot;&gt;Coogan, M., ed. The New Oxford Annotated Bible. (Oxford University Press: Oxford) 2001), pp. 728.&lt;/ref&gt; replying to the inquiry of God as to whence he had come with the words: &quot;from going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it&quot; (Job 1:7).

The dialogue that ensues characterizes Satan as a member of the divine council who observes human activity, but with the purpose of searching out men's sins and appearing as their accuser. He is, as it were, a celestial &quot;prosecutor&quot;. He persists in his opinion of Job even after he has passed through his first trial by surrendering to the will of God, whereupon the Satan demands another test through physical suffering (Job 2:3–5). Satan challenges Job's righteousness by saying that his belief is built only upon the material goods he has been given, and that his faith will disappear as soon as they are taken from him.

The introduction of &quot;the adversary&quot; occurs in the framing story alone: he is never clearly alluded to in the central poem at all, although [[Sheol]] is mentioned in the central poem, as well as Job's need for an adversary (although it is doubtful that he is referring to the original adversary of the story).

In Job &quot;Satan&quot; is not yet the devil's personal name, as in later Judeo-Christian works.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coogan, M. 2001 pp. 728&quot;/&gt;

==Job's wife==
[[File:Georges de La Tour 044.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Georges de La Tour]], &lt;br&gt;''Job Mocked by his Wife''.]]
Job's wife is introduced in Job 2:9 when she suggests that Job [[curse]] God and die. She is not directly mentioned at any other place in the book. Throughout the ordeal, she survives and lives on with Job. There is uncertainty about her intentions when she tells Job to curse God but it is clear that Job honors her by the way he talks about her in Chapter 31.

In this regard, it is notable that the Hebrew word in the [[Masoretic]] text most often translated as &quot;curse&quot; is ברך, which primarily means to &quot;kneel&quot; or to &quot;bless&quot; and only euphemistically denotes &quot;curse.&quot;{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} If Job's wife meant &quot;bless God and die,&quot; her statement would correspond more both to the character of a righteous woman and to the literal practice which survives to this day of blessing the Creator with one's last words where possible. Job's critical response to her may then be interpreted as challenging the notion that, when undergoing severe suffering, one should necessarily be resigned to one's imminent demise.

==Behemoth and Leviathan==
{{See also|Lotan}}
In a second divine speech that appears immediately after Job has conceded defeat, Yahweh provides an extensive description of two creations: [[Behemoth]] (Job 40.15-24) and [[Leviathan]] (Job 41.1-34). In Ugaritic texts Leviathan is the chaos deity, a seven-headed primeval sea-monster. The depiction of Leviathan resembles that of the Mesopotamian primeval sea goddess [[Tiamat]]. The creature Behemoth appears only once in the bible (Job 40.15-24), but appears to be another type of primeval sea-monster.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coogan, M 2009 pp.387&quot;&gt;Coogan, M. A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament: The Hebrew Bible in its Context. (Oxford University Press: Oxford) 2009), pp.387.&lt;/ref&gt; In Job, both Behemoth (Job 40.15-24) and Leviathan (Job 41.1-34) are depicted as insurmountable foes to the mortal, yet it is stated that Yahweh made them just as Yahweh made Job (Job 40.15).

==Origin and textual history==
Most modern scholars date the extant text to the 4th century BCE, prior to [[Ecclesiastes]] in the development of [[Wisdom literature]].&lt;ref&gt;Katherine Dell, review of Gerald H. Wilson, &quot;Job&quot; (New International Biblical Commentary, 2007), RBL 03/2008&lt;/ref&gt; While &quot;there is an intentional editorial unity with a cohesive purpose and message in the canonical form of the book,&quot; Job contains many separate elements, some of which may have had an independent existence prior to being incorporated into the present text.&lt;ref&gt;Gerald H. Wilson, &quot;Job&quot; (New International Biblical Commentary; Hendrickson, 2007) p.11&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars agree that the introductory and concluding sections of the book, the framing devices, were composed to set the central poem into a prose &quot;folk-book&quot;, as the compilers of the ''Jewish Encyclopedia'' expressed it. The central poem is from another source.

Among the Dead Sea Scrolls is the [http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/~humm/Resources/StudTxts/11Q10!.html Targum of Job 11Q10]. Another example of text from the last chapter or epilogue of Job can be found in the book ''The Dead Sea Scrolls: A New Translation'', showing examples of how fragments of The Book of Job found among the scrolls differ from the text as now known.

===The &quot;Job Motif&quot; in earlier literature===
{{See|Ludlul bēl nēmeqi}}
The [[Assyriology|Assyriologist]] and [[Sumerian language|Sumerologist]] [[Samuel Noah Kramer]] in 1954 presented a [[Sumer]]ian text treating the &quot;Job motif&quot; of the righteous sufferer.&lt;ref&gt;Kramer, Samuel Noah, &quot;Man and His God: A Sumerian Variation on the 'Job' Motif&quot;, in Noth, M. and Thomas, D. W. (ed.), Wisdom in Israel and in the Ancient Near East Presented to Professor Harold Henry Rowley (Supplements to Vetus Testamentum, 3) Brill: Leiden, 1955 , 170-182. Also discussed in ''History Begins at Sumer: Thirty-Nine &quot;Firsts&quot; in Recorded History'' (1956)&lt;/ref&gt;
The Sumerian text is known as &quot;A man and his god&quot;, after the incipit ''lu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-ulu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; nam-mah dingir-ra-na''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-etcsl.orient.ox.ac.uk/section5/tr524.htm A man and his god: translation] at the Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ludlul bēl nēmeqi]] is a Babylonian text, also known as the &quot;Babylonian Job&quot;, which concerns itself with the  unjust suffering of an afflicted man, named Shubshi-meshre-Shakkan.

&quot;The Protestation of Guiltlessness,&quot; from the [[Egyptian Book of the Dead]], is a collection of assertions of innocence which were included in ancient Egyptian burial rites, and is often compared to Job, especially chapter 31.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coogan, M 2009 p.382&quot;&gt;Coogan, M. A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament: The Hebrew Bible in its Context. (Oxford University Press: Oxford 2009), p.382&lt;/ref&gt;

While these and other ancient Near Eastern texts consider comparable issues, scholars have not found a direct antecedent to Job. However, the similarity between the central concerns of Job and those of certain ancient Babylonian and Egyptian texts reveals a shared interest in the question of why the innocent suffer. These texts also share an interest in challenging traditional views of the nature of divine justice.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coogan, M 2009 p.382&quot;/&gt;

===Later interpolations and additions===
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2009}}
Various interpolations have been claimed to have been made in the text of the central poem. The most common such claims are of two kinds: the &quot;parallel texts&quot;, which are parallel developments of the corresponding passages in the base text, and the speeches of Elihu (Chapters 32-37), which consist of a polemic against the ideas expressed elsewhere in the poem, and so are claimed to be interpretive interpolations. The speeches of Elihu (who is not mentioned in the prologue) are claimed to contradict the fundamental opinions expressed by the &quot;friendly accusers&quot; in the central body of the poem, according to which it is impossible that the righteous should suffer, all pain being a punishment for some sin. Elihu, however, reveals that suffering may be decreed for the righteous as a protection against greater sin, for moral betterment and warning, and to elicit greater trust and dependence on a merciful, compassionate God in the midst of adversity.

The status of Elihu's interrupting didactic sermon is brought further into question by his extremely sudden appearance and disappearance from the text. He is not mentioned in Job 2:11, in which Job's friends are introduced, nor is he mentioned at all in the epilogue, 42:7-10, in which God expresses anger at Job's friends. It is suggested that had Elihu appeared in the original source, his spirited and virtuous defence of the divine right to punish would have been rewarded by God in the conclusion, or at the very least mentioned. Additionally, Elihu's first spoken words are a confession of his youthful status, being much younger than the three canonical friends, including a claim to be speaking because he cannot bear to remain silent; it has been suggested that this interesting statement may have been symbolic of a &quot;younger&quot; (that is to say, later and interpolating) writer, who has written Elihu's sermon to respond to what he views as morally and theologically scandalous statements being made within the book of Job, and creating the literary device of Elihu to provide what seemed to be a much-needed faith-based response to further refute [[heresy]] and provide a satisfying counter-argument, a need partially provided by God's ambiguous and unspecific response to Job at the end of the book.

Subjects of further contention among scholars are the identity of claimed corrections and revisions of Job's speeches, which are claimed to have been made for the purpose of harmonizing them with the orthodox doctrine of retribution. A prime example of such a claim is the translation of the last line Job speaks (42:6), which is extremely problematic in the Hebrew. Traditional translations have him say, &quot;Therefore I despise myself, and repent in dust and ashes.&quot; This is consonant with the central body of the poem and Job's speeches, other mortal encounters with the divine in the Bible (Isaiah in Chapter 6, for example), and the fact that there would have been no restoration without Job's humble repentant acknowledgment of mortality faced with divinity in all its majesty and glory. However, other scholarly interpretations of this verse also exist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theologie.uzh.ch/faecher/altes-testament/thomas-krueger/Krueger_2006_Job.pdf (for example)]&lt;/ref&gt; J.B. Curtis in his 1979 paper &quot;On Job's Response to Yahweh&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jstor.org/pss/3265665]&lt;/ref&gt;, argues that Job's final responses to Yahweh are a total rejection of Yahweh rather than an expression of repentance, and translates Job 42:6 as &quot;Therefore I feel loathing contempt and revulsion (toward you, O God); and I am sorry for frail man.&quot;

===Talmudic tradition===
The [[Talmud]]ic [[Tractate Bava Batra]] 15a-b maintains that Job was written by Moses, although nowhere does it name its author. Other opinions in the Talmud ascribe it to the period of before the [[Solomon's Temple|First Temple]], the time of the patriarch Jacob, or King Ahaserus.

The medieval exegete [[Abraham ibn Ezra]] believed that Job was translated from another language and it is therefore unclear &quot;like all translated books&quot; (Ibn Ezra Job 2:11). It is set in the land of [[Edom]], which has been retained as the background, and in the prologue and epilogue, the name of God is [[YHVH]], a name that even the Edomites used.

Job is prominent in [[Aggadah|haggadic]] legends. The later Greek ''[[Testament of Job]]'' figures among the [[apocrypha]].

==Dissenting/Speculative Wisdom==
Michael Coogan writes in regards to both Ecclesiastes and Job that “Both take positions opposed to the mainstream of the wisdom tradition in the Bible, as exemplified in the book of Proverbs…” &lt;ref&gt;Coogan, M. “A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament: The Hebrew Bible in its Context. Oxford University Press, New York 2009 p.380&lt;/ref&gt; Job, along with [[Ecclesiastes]] is part of the dissenting or speculative group of [[wisdom literature]] within the Old Testament.&lt;ref&gt;Shupak, Nili: Where can wisdom be found?: the sage’s language Bible and in ancient Egyptian literature University Press, Freiburg Switzerland 1993 p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; In the narrative there are conversations that occur between Job and family, Job and friends, and Job and God. Conventional wisdom may be applied to the questions and advice given by Job’s friends or family, yet it is Job’s responses that make this book part of the dissenting wisdom or “anti-wisdom wisdom” &lt;ref&gt;Pope, Marvin H. “Job: The Anchor Bible (p.LXXIII) Doubleday, New York 1965,1973&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Judaism==
{{Books of Ketuvim}}
The [[Talmud]] occasionally discusses Job. Most traditional [[Torah]] scholarship has not doubted Job's existence. He was seen as a real and powerful figure. One Talmudic opinion has it that Job was in fact one of three advisors that [[Pharaoh]] consulted, prior to taking action against the increasingly multiplying &quot;Children of Israel&quot; mentioned in the [[Book of Exodus]] during the time of [[Moses]]' birth. The episode is mentioned in the [[Talmud]] (Tractate Sotah): [[Balaam]] gives evil advice urging Pharaoh to kill the Hebrew male new-born babies, [[Jethro (Bible)|Jethro]] opposes Pharaoh and tells him not to harm the Hebrews at all, and Job keeps silent and does not reveal his mind even though he was personally opposed to Pharaoh's destructive plans. It is for his silence that God subsequently punishes him with his bitter afflictions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.torah.org/learning/yomtov/pesach/5755/vol1no10.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a minority view among the rabbis of the Talmud, that of [[Rabbi]] [[Shimon ben Lakish]], that Job never existed ([[Midrash]] Genesis Rabbah LXVII, Talmud Bavli, Bava Batra 15a). In this view, Job was a literary creation by a [[prophet]] who used this form of writing to convey a divine message or parable. On the other hand, the Talmud (in Tractate Baba Batra 15a-16b) goes to great lengths trying to ascertain when Job actually lived, citing many opinions and interpretations by the leading sages. Job is further mentioned in the Talmud as follows [http://www.aishdas.org/webshas/torah/bichtav/tanach/iyyov.htm]:
* Job's resignation to his fate (in Tractate Pesachim 2b)
* Anyone who associated with Job when he was prosperous,  including to buy from him or sell to him, was blessed (in Tractate Pesachim 112a)
* Job's reward for being generous (in Tractate Megillah 28a)
* [[David|King David]], Job, and [[Ezekiel]] described the Torah's length without putting a number to it (in Tractate Eruvin 21a)

Two further Talmudic traditions hold that Job either lived in the time of [[Abraham]] or of [[Jacob]]. Levi ben Laḥma held that Job lived in the time of [[Moses]], by whom the Book of Job was written. Others argue that it was written by Job himself (see {{bibleverse|Job||19:23-24|}}), or by Elihu, or [[Isaiah]].

=== Source for Jewish Law ===
Some of the [[Halakha|law]]s and [[Minhag|custom]]s of [[Bereavement in Judaism|mourning in Judaism]] are derived from the Book of Job's depiction of Job's mourning and the behavior of his companions. For example, according to {{Specify|date=March 2007}}, the behavior of Job's comforters, who kept silence until he spoke to them, is the source for a norm applicable to contemporary traditional Jewish practice, that visitors to a house of mourning should not speak to the mourner until they are spoken to.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.myjewishlearning.com/texts/Weekly_Torah_Commentary/shemini_ujafedny5762.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Liturgical use===
In most traditions of Jewish liturgy, the Book of Job is not read publicly in the manner of the [[Torah|Pentateuch]], [[Nevi'im|Prophets]], or [[Five Megillot|megillot]]. However, there are some Jews, particularly the [[Spanish and Portuguese Jews]], who do hold public readings of the Book of Job on the [[Tisha B'Av]] fast (a day of mourning over the destruction of the [[Solomon's Temple|First]] and [[Second Temple|Second]] [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temples]] and other tragedies).

The [[cantillation]] signs for the large poetic section in the middle of the Book of Job differ from those of most of the biblical books, using a system shared with it only by [[Psalms]] and [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]]. A sample of how the cantillations are chanted is found below.

Many quotes from the Book of Job are used throughout Jewish liturgy, especially at funerals and times of mourning.

===Philosophical approach===
[[Maimonides]], a twelfth century rabbi, discusses Job in his work [[The Guide for the Perplexed]]. According to Maimonides (III 22–23), each of Job's friends represents famous, distinct schools of thought concerning God and divine providence. According to Maimonides, the correct view of providence lies with Elihu, who teaches Job that one must examine his religion (Job 33). This view corresponds with the notion that &quot;the only worthy religion in the world is an examined religion.&quot; A habit religion, such as that originally practiced by Job, is never enough. One has to look deep into the meaning of religion in order to fully appreciate it and make it a genuine part of one's life. Elihu believed in the concepts of divine providence, rewards to individuals, as well as punishments. He believed, according to Maimonides, that one has to practice religion in a rational way. The more one investigates religion, the more he will be rewarded or find it rewarding. In the beginning, Job was an unexamining, pious man, not a philosopher, and he did not have providence. He was unwise, simply grateful for what he had. God, according to Elihu, did not single out Job for punishment, but rather abandoned him and let him be dealt with by natural, unfriendly forces.

Conversely, in more recent times, Russian existentialist philosopher [[Lev Shestov]] viewed Job as the embodiment of the battle between reason (which offers general and seemingly comforting explanations for complex events) and faith in a personal god, and one man's desperate cry for him. In fact, Shestov used the story of Job as a central signifier for his core philosophy (the vast critique of the history of Western philosophy, which he saw broadly as a monumental battle between Reason and Faith, Athens and Jerusalem, secular and religious outlook):

&quot;The whole book is one uninterrupted contest between the 'cries' of the much-afflicted Job and the 'reflections' of his rational friends. The friends, as true thinkers, look not at Job but at the 'general.' Job, however, does not wish to hear about the 'general'; he knows that the general is deaf and dumb - and that it is impossible to speak with it. 'But I would speak to the Almighty, and I desire to argue my case with God' (13:3). The friends are horrified at Job's words: they are convinced that it is not possible to speak with God and that the Almighty is concerned about the firmness of his power and the unchangeability of his laws but not about the fate of the people created by him. Perhaps they are convinced that in general God does not know any concerns but that he only rules. That is why they answer, 'You who tear yourself in your anger, shall the earth be forsaken for you or the rock be removed from its place?' (18:4). And, indeed, shall rocks really be removed from their place for the sake of Job? And shall necessity renounce its sacred rights? This would truly be the summit of human audacity, this would truly be a 'mutiny,' a 'revolt' of the single human personality against the eternal laws of the all-unity of being!&quot; (Speculation and Apocalypse).

===Mystical approach===
According to the mystical approach, Job is being punished because he is a heretic.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} According to [[Nachmanides]], Job's children did not die in the beginning of the story, but rather were taken captive and then return from captivity by the end of the story.

==In Christianity==
[[Christian]]s accept the Book of Job as part of the Old Testament canon. The character of Job is also mentioned in the New Testament, as an example of perseverance in suffering ({{bibleref|James|5:11}}). There are several references to the Book of Job throughout the [[New Testament]], especially the [[Epistles]]. Specifically:

[[Book of Revelation|Rev.]] 9:6 alludes to {{bibleverse|Job||3:21|}}; compare [[Second Epistle to the Thessalonians|2 Thes.]] 2:8 to {{bibleverse|Job||4:9|}}; [[First Epistle to the Corinthians|1 Cor.]] 3:19 quotes {{bibleverse|Job||5:13|}}; [[Epistle to the Hebrews|Heb.]] 12:5, Jas. 1:12, and Rev. 3:19 all parallel {{bibleverse|Job||5:17|}} and {{bibleverse|Job||23:10|}}; compare Jas. 4:14 to {{bibleverse|Job||7:6|}}; compare Heb. 2:6 with {{bibleverse|Job||7:17|}}; compare Heb. 12:26 with {{bibleverse|Job||9:6|}}; [[Epistle to the Romans|Rom.]] 9:20 alludes to {{bibleverse|Job||9:32|}}; Rom. 11:33 parallels {{bibleverse|Job||35:7|}}; compare [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] 17:28 with {{bibleverse|Job||12:10|}}; compare 1 Cor. 4:5 with {{bibleverse|Job||12:22|}}; compare [[First Epistle of Peter|1 Pet.]] 1:24 with {{bibleverse|Job||14:2|}}; compare [[Gospel of Luke|Lk.]] 19:22 with {{bibleverse|Job||15:6|}}; Rom. 1:9 parallels {{bibleverse|Job||16:19|}}; compare [[First Epistle of John|1 John]] 3:2 with {{bibleverse|Job||19:26|}}; Rev. 14:10, 19:15 parallel {{bibleverse|Job||21:20|}}; both Rom. 11:34 and 1 Cor. 2:16 quote [[Book of Isaiah|Isa.]] 40:13, which parallels {{bibleverse|Job||21:22|}}; [[Gospel of Matthew|Mt.]] 25:42 alludes to {{bibleverse|Job||22:7|}}; Jas. 4:6 and 1 Pet. 5:5 both quote [[Book of Proverbs|Prov.]] 3:34, which parallels {{bibleverse|Job||22:29|}}; compare Acts 1:7 with {{bibleverse|Job||24:1|}}; Heb. 4:13 parallels {{bibleverse|Job||26:6|}}; Mt. 16:26 alludes to {{bibleverse|Job||27:8|}}; compare Jas. 1:5 with {{bibleverse|Job||32:8|}}; 1 Jo. 1:9 alludes to {{bibleverse|Job||33:27-28|}}; Jas. 5:4 alludes to {{bibleverse|Job||34:28|}}; Rev. 16:21 alludes to {{bibleverse|Job||38:22-23|}}; Mt. 6:26 alludes to {{bibleverse|Job||38:41|}}; and finally, Rom. 11:35 quotes {{bibleverse|Job||41:11|}}. (see [[Good News Bible]] special edition)

Christian themes include God's mercy (not treating sinners as they truly deserve), grace (treating unworthy sinners as they do not deserve), compassion (toleration of much discrediting, inappropriate mortal speculation impugning the divine character, and allegations of unrighteous/unfair dealings with men), restoration (where sin abounds, generosity superabounds) [[omnipotence]], omnisapience [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sapience], [[omnipresence]], omniliberty, [[aseity]] and infinite love.

===Messianic anticipation in the book===
In Chapter nine, Job recognizes the chasm that exists between him and God: “For he is not a man, as I am, that I might answer him, that we should come to trial together.” &lt;ref&gt;Job 9:32, RSV&lt;/ref&gt; Job’s regret is that he has no arbiter to act as a go-between; that Job can not reconcile himself with God anticipates the need for the Messiah to become [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnate]].&lt;ref&gt;Walter Kaiser, The Messiah in the Old Testament, (Grand Rapids: Zondervan Publishing House, 1995), p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; In verse 33, Job wishes that there was an “umpire” (Heb. mokiah) to decide between him and God. One scholar says, “This person would have to be superior in authority to either party, ”;&lt;ref&gt;Marvin Pope, Job: The Anchor Bible, (New York: Doubleday, 1965), 74.&lt;/ref&gt; thus the arbiter for whom Job hopes would have to himself be divine, or else he would no more be qualified to “lay his hand upon” God than is Job.

This idea of a divine arbiter is returned to at Job 16:19. Job again expresses his desire for a witness, and then declares, “my eyes pour out tears to God, that he would maintain the right of a man with God”.&lt;ref&gt;Job 16:20b-21a&lt;/ref&gt; Job addresses God, desiring that God will advocate on Job’s behalf with himself.&lt;ref&gt;James Smith, What the Bible Teaches about the Promised Messiah, (Nashville: Thomas Nelson Publishers, 1993), 213.&lt;/ref&gt; Job knows that no man such as himself, conceived in sin, can appeal to God on his behalf; so God must do it himself. The language used earlier is that of a judicial judgement , in which God is both judge of and lawyer for Job. Job “draws a distinction in God” , and this distinction anticipates [[Trinity|the multiplicity of God’s persons]].

Job’s faith in this arbiter is again brought up in chapter 19. It is commonly accepted that the “Redeemer” of 19:25 is the same person as the witness of 16:19.&lt;ref&gt;e.g., John Telgren, The Identity of Job’s Goel in Job 19:25, 1999, 4.&lt;/ref&gt; This verse in particular is often seen as an anticipation of Christianity. Telgren notes that it has been suggested that verses 25 and 26 have a poetic structure of ABBA. If this is true it would support the notion that God is himself the Redeemer, by associating him with the living Redeemer in the parallel structure. The RSV’s “Redeemer” is a translation of the Hebrew go’el. That this go’el could refer to God is explicitly demonstrated in the Psalms and Proverbs, and elsewhere.

This translation of go'el in Job 19:25-26 as &quot;[[Redeemer (Christianity)|Redeemer]]&quot; has been made famous by its use in Handel's ''Messiah'' and in the lectionary during the Easter season.  The go'el was a kinsman redeemer whose role included avenging bloodshed, redeeming land sold to others outside the family, and redeeming family members sold into slavery. &lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, Robert L., Jr.; The Go'el in Ancient Israel: Theological Reflection on and Israelite Institution, http://biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/goel_hubbard.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  The Christ, as both God and Man, is seen in Christian theology as fulfilling this role in the redemption of man and of the earth and in the final judgment against evil. &lt;ref&gt;Muhlestein, Kerry M.; Ruth, Redemption, Covenant, and Christ (2009,) http://en.scientificcommons.org/54038374&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, Robert L., Jr.; The Go'el in Ancient Israel: Theological Reflection on and Israelite Institution, http://biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/goel_hubbard.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative translation of the passage reads as follows:

{{quote|&quot;But as for me, I know that my vindicator lives,&lt;/br&gt;and that he will at last stand forth upon the dust.&lt;/br&gt;This will happen when my flesh has been stripped off,&lt;/br&gt;but from my flesh I would see God.&quot;}}

The capitalization of &quot;Redeemer&quot; (here translated as &quot;vindicator&quot;) is a choice of the translator.  The Hebrew language has no capital letters.  The capitalization is used in preference to the idea that the passage references the Messiah &lt;ref&gt;John Telgren, The Identity of Job’s Goel in Job 19:25, 1999, 4.&lt;/ref&gt;.  However the use of &quot;go'el&quot; here can also be taken to reference a human avenger-of-blood. &lt;ref&gt;Coogan, Michael. A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament. Oxford Press., 2009. Pp 385&lt;/ref&gt;  According to this reading, Job is asserting that after he is dead, his go'el will take up his case. However, he would rather it happen before he dies.  This interpretation is supported with the argument that there is nowhere else in the book where Job express a wish for bodily resurrection, only for someone to intervene as an &quot;umpire&quot;, a &quot;vindicator&quot;, a &quot;go'el&quot;, on his behalf as an impartial judge between himself and God in the present.&lt;ref&gt;Coogan, Michael. A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament. Oxford Press., 2009. Pp 385&lt;/ref&gt;

===Liturgical use===
The [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] reads from Job during [[Holy Week]].
{{quote|“Throughout the whole [[Lent]] the two books of the Old Testament read at Vespers were Genesis and Proverbs. With the beginning of the Holy Week they are replaced by Exodus and Job.  Exodus is the story of Israel's liberation from Egyptian slavery, of their Passover.  It prepares us for the understanding of Christ's exodus to his Father, of his fulfillment of the whole history of salvation.  Job, the sufferer, is the Old Testament icon of Christ.  This reading announces the great mystery of Christ's sufferings, obedience and sacrifice.”|[[Alexander Schmemann]],|&quot;A Liturgical Explanation for the Days of Holy Week&quot;}}

The [[Roman Catholic Church]] traditionally reads from the Book of Job during [[Matins]] in the first two weeks of September, as well as in the Office of the Dead. In the revised [[Liturgy of the Hours]], Job is read during the Eighth and Ninth Weeks in [[Ordinary Time]].

==Middle Eastern folk traditions on Job==
In [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] folk tradition, Ayyub's place of trial is Al-Joura, a village outside the town of Al Majdal ([[Ashkelon]]). It was there, God rewarded him with a [[Fountain of Youth]] that removed whatever illnesses he had, and restored his youth. The town of Al-Joura was a place of annual festivities (4 days in all) when people of many faiths gathered and bathed in a natural spring. In [[Turkey]], Job is known as ''Eyüp'', and he is supposed to have lived in [[Şanlıurfa]]. There is also a tomb of Job outside the city of [[Salalah]] in [[Oman]].

==References to Ayyub (Job) in the Qur'an==

In Islam, [[Job (Biblical figure)|Job]] (ايوب) was a prophet renowned for his endurance (assumed to be of pain and suffering). One tradition holds that his tomb is located near Salalah, in the Sultanate of Oman, possibly indicating he made his wealth in the frankincense trade.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Tanakh OT}}

The '''Book of Proverbs''' (in Hebrew: מִשְלֵי ''Mish'lé'') is a book of the [[Hebrew Bible]].
The original [[Hebrew (language)|Hebrew]] title of the book of Proverbs is &quot;Míshlê Shlomoh&quot; (&quot;Proverbs of [[Solomon]]&quot;). When translated into [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin]], the title took on different forms. In the Greek [[Septuagint]] (LXX) the title became &quot;paroimai paroimiae&quot; (&quot;Proverbs&quot;). In the [[Latin]] [[Vulgate]] the title was &quot;proverbia&quot;, from which the English title of Proverbs is derived.

==Authorship==
{{Books of the Old Testament}}
The authorship of Proverbs has long been a matter of dispute. Solomon’s name appears in Proverbs 1:1, &quot;The proverbs of Solomon the son of [[David]], King of Israel.&quot; There are also references within Proverbs to [[Agur]] (30:1) and [[Lemuel (Biblical king)|Lemuel]] (31:1) as authors distinct from Solomon.  These names are missing in the Greek translation of the [[Septuagint]].  Medieval scholars used in the [[Vulgate]] the Hebrew rendering of these two verses, and in their eyes the words &quot;Agur&quot; and &quot;Lemuel&quot; were but symbolical names of Solomon.&lt;ref&gt;Dean, Matt (1913). &quot;Book of Proverbs&quot;. Catholic Encyclopedia. [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12505b.htm Newadvent.org]&lt;/ref&gt; 
Solomon is often mentioned as someone who has extensive [[wisdom]] in the Bible as well as in extra-biblical literature. In [[1 Kings]] 4:32, 3000 proverbs and over 1000 songs are said to have come from Solomon and it is also said that people came from all over to hear the wisdom of Solomon. Not only are the names &quot;Agur&quot; and &quot;Lemuel&quot; linked to other sections of the book, there are elements of disunity within the book that suggest more than one author. 
Some of the authorship is attributed to &quot;Men of [[Hezekiah]]&quot; (25:1), though it is stated that they simply transcribed the proverbs rather than writing them of their own accord.

In terms of the text itself there are at least eight specific instances where authorship is mentioned:

{| style=&quot;width:75%
|-
|Proverbs
|Authors/Collectors
|- 
| 1:1
| Solomon
|- 
| 10:1
| Solomon
|- 
| 25:1
| Solomon (as copied by [[Hezekiah]]’s men)
|- 
| 30:1
| [[Agur son of Jakeh]]
|- 
| 31:1
| [[Lemuel (biblical king)|Lemuel]] (or his mother)
|}

Studies of word usage have indicated that the highest percentage of commonalities are between the three Solomon sections. The next most common are the Wise Men sections, showing that they could have influenced Solomon’s writing, and the least commonalities were with the Agur, Lemuel, and the unknown author. A majority of critical scholars, including [[James L. Crenshaw]], [[Roland E. Murphy]] and [[L. G. Perdue]], hold to the belief that much of Proverbs was brought together from a time well after Solomon.  However, many Conservative Evangelicals continue to attribute most of the book to Solomon, including [[J. I. Packer]], [[John Piper (theologian)|John Piper]], [[John F. MacArthur]], and [[Albert Mohler]].

==Influences==
There has been a consensus among scholars that there is a crossover of some Egyptian and Assyrian nature in the proverbs from The [[Instructions of Amenemopet]] &lt;ref&gt;”Ancient Egyptian Literature, Volume II: The New Kingdom”, p146-163, Miriam Lichtheim, University of California Press, 1976, ISBN 0-520-03615-8&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ahiqar]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=cSmldJgaEawC&amp;pg=PA51 The personification of Wisdom], Alice M. Sinnott, Society for Old Testament Study&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proverbs as wisdom literature==
The book of Proverbs is referred to as [[wisdom literature]] along with several others: the [[book of Job]], [[Ecclesiastes]], the [[Song of Solomon]], and certain [[Psalms]], known as wisdom psalms. Among the [[deuterocanonical]] books, [[Ecclesiasticus]] and the [[Wisdom of Solomon]] are [[wisdom literature]].

Throughout Proverbs, wisdom (or the wise person) is compared and contrasted with foolishness (or the fool). 'Fool' in Proverbs indicates one who is lacking in morality and uninterested in correction, not one who is merely silly or playful.  Wisdom is held up as something worth effort to attain and the reader is told that it starts with the person of [[YHWH]]: &quot;The fear of YHWH is the beginning of wisdom.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Proverbs 1:7, 9:10&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, throughout Proverbs, wisdoms are mostly come from father to son or mother to son structure.&lt;ref&gt;Proverbs 1-9&lt;/ref&gt; This wisdom literature is concerned with the realities of human experience, from the mundane to the sublime, and with the relationship between that experience and the divine.  Not only that, we can also find many wisdoms of woman over and over, especially we find reference to Wisdom as a female figure who speaks to the young man and invites him into her house. When we talk about this [[Woman Wisdom]], it speaks frequently in the first person &lt;ref&gt;Proverbs 1:20-33;8:1-36;9:1-6&lt;/ref&gt; and identifies herself not just as the divine companion, but also as the source of order in society and success in life.&lt;ref&gt;Proverbs 8:15-21&lt;/ref&gt; Over and over in the book of Proverbs, it addressed a warning to the young man to avoid sexual relationships with a foreign or strange woman.&lt;ref&gt;Proverbs 7:16-20&lt;/ref&gt; In here women as &quot;foreign or &quot;strange&quot; (that is, a stranger, a non-Israelite) reflects the frequent biblical insistence on marriage within the community.

==Setting==
It is difficult to pin down the provenance of Proverbs. Several suggestions have been made. 

*'''Family'''
In the society of ancient Israel, the family played an important role in the upbringing and education of children. Some internal evidence hints to the use of Proverbs in a family setting; the phrase &quot;my son&quot; appears some 20 times throughout the book. The role of the mother is also listed some 10 times.

*'''Court'''
The name of Solomon stands in the title of the book, thus suggesting a royal setting. Throughout the Old Testament, wisdom is connected with the court.

*'''School'''
It is possible practical and reflective wisdom was transmitted in a house of learning or instruction.&lt;ref&gt;W. Dennis Tucker, &quot;Literary Forms in the Wisdom Literature&quot; In: An introduction to Wisdom Literature and the Psalms, FS Marvin E. Tate, ed. H. Wayne Ballard, 163-166&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biblical examples of Setting===

There is evidence in the book of Proverbs that can show the type of setting described above. According to Coogan in his Introduction to the Old testament, the authors were most likely writing to a patriarchal society with some evidence of a monarchy. &quot;While generally conventional in its values, the book of Proverbs testifies to some of the ideals of the ancient Israelite law and of the teachings of the prophets of social justice.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Coogan, M 2009 pp.387&quot;&gt;Coogan, M. A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament: The Hebrew Bible in its Context. (Oxford University Press: Oxford) 2009), pp.387.&lt;/ref&gt;

Here are some biblical examples of setting:

'''Family'''

The role of the mother- Proverbs 1.8; 10.1 &lt;ref&gt;Coogan, M. A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament: The Hebrew Bible in its Context. (Oxford University Press: Oxford) 2009), pp.376-377.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Court'''

Critiques of monarchs- Proverbs 30. 24-28, 29-31&lt;ref name=&quot;Coogan, M 2009 pp.387&quot;/&gt;

==Messianic interpretations in Christianity==
There are found in Proverbs, and other [[wisdom literature]], references to Wisdom as a personification. These have long been taken by Christian exegetes as references to Christ, who is called the wisdom of God by [[Paul the Apostle]](1 Cor 1:24).The first time Wisdom is personified is at Prov 1.20. In all these passages Wisdom is spoken of as a woman because the Hebrew(''[[chokhmah]]'') and Greek word(''[[Sophia (wisdom)|sophia]]'') for “wisdom” is itself feminine.&lt;ref&gt;Wade Johnston, Proverbs 8, 2004, 4.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[King James Bible]] reads, in reference to wisdom in Prov. 8:22, that &quot;''The LORD &lt;u&gt;possessed&lt;/u&gt; me in the beginning of his way, &lt;u&gt;before&lt;/u&gt; his works of old.''&quot; The [[Revised Standard Version]] reads “''The LORD &lt;u&gt;created&lt;/u&gt; me at the beginning of his work, &lt;u&gt;the first&lt;/u&gt; of his acts of old.''”&lt;ref&gt;[http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/r/rsv/rsv-idx?type=DIV1&amp;byte=2456543 Revised Standard Version, Proverbs]&lt;/ref&gt; Proverbs 8 has long been taken by Christians to refer to Christ, so whether or not the Hebrew קנה(qanah) should be taken as &quot;created&quot; or as 
&quot;possessed&quot; was used in the debate over the eternity of Christ. Both these meanings are used in the Old Testament but many contemporary scholars render it as &quot;created&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.ca/books?id=cSmldJgaEawC&amp;pg=PA25 The personification of Wisdom], Alice M. Sinnott, Society for Old Testament Study, p 25&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of &quot;possessed&quot; such as Kidner argue that it is absurd to think that God would need to create Wisdom, implying there was a time when he lacked Wisdom. Also, “Prov 8 starts from the indisputable commonplace that God existed before the start of time and ascribes the same precedence to wisdom.”&lt;ref&gt;Michael Fox, Proverbs 1-9: The Anchor Bible, (New York: Doubleday, 2000), 284.&lt;/ref&gt; The remainder of Prov 8 they argue, shows Wisdom taking a role in creation, and contrasts Wisdom with created things. However, understanding קנה as possessed leaves open the possibility that Wisdom should be understood here as a personification of an attribute of God rather an entity in its own right.&lt;ref name=&quot;ref&quot;&gt;[http://books.google.ca/books?id=BUbM16h3D-MC&amp;pg=PA54 Who knows what is good? : a commentary on the Books of Proverbs and Ecclesiastes], Kathleen Anne Farmer, pp.53-54&lt;/ref&gt;  The Hebrew אמון('amown) in Prov. 8:30 is still a subject of debate among Bible scholars. 'Amown has been undestood as either: &quot;artisan or master craftsman&quot; which suggests that Wisdom is an active participant in creation, or as &quot;nursling&quot; which excludes any notion of Wisdom's active participation in creation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bible.cc/proverbs/8-30.htm Parallel translation of Proverbs 8:30]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The personification of Wisdom, Alice M. Sinnott, Society for Old Testament Study, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.ca/books?id=BUbM16h3D-MC&amp;pg=PA55 Who knows what is good? : a commentary on the Books of Proverbs and Ecclesiastes], Kathleen Anne Farmer, 55&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been noted by some Christian exegetes that Col 1:15-16 is dependent on this chapter of Proverbs.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Fox, Proverbs 1-9: The Anchor Bible, (New York: Doubleday, 2000), 279.&lt;/ref&gt; The parallels in the roles of Christ and Wisdom, they argue lend credence to understanding qanah as possessed rather than created. They argue that &quot;Wisdom was, before the Lord made even a particle of matter (verse 26) or gave order to creation (verse 29); Wisdom participated in the creation story. This strongly parallels the role of Christ in Colossians, where he is the “first-born of all creation” and in him were all things created. To add to the identification of Wisdom with Christ, we find that Wisdom was identified with the Greek concept of [[logos]], which was in turn identified with Christ.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Fox, Proverbs 1-9: The Anchor Bible, (New York: Doubleday, 2000), 293.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prov 8:22 was a crucial verse in the [[Arian controversy|Arian controversies]] of the fourth century CE. This verse was used both to support and refute the Arians' claims. Assuming first that Christ could be equated with the &quot;Wisdom of God&quot;(1 Cor. 1:24), the Arians argued that the son, like Wisdom was created, and to be a creature, whether the first or the most prominent of creatures, is to be subordinate to the creator. Those who formulated the [[Nicean Creed|Nicean declaration]] that the Son was &quot;begotten, not made&quot; were inclined to translate קנה in Prov. 8:22 as &quot;begot me&quot; in order to argue that God and Christ were [[cosubstantial]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ref&quot;/&gt;

{{Tanakh OT}}
The '''Book of Lamentations''' ({{lang-he-n|אֵיכָה}}, ''Eikhah'', ʾēkhā(h)) is a poetic book of the [[Hebrew Bible]] composed by the [[Jewish]] prophet [[Jeremiah]]. It mourns the [[Siege of Jerusalem (587 BC)|destruction of Jerusalem]] and the [[First Temple|Holy Temple]] in the [[6th Century BC|6th Century BCE]].

In [[Judaism]] it is traditionally recited on the fast day of [[Tisha B'Av]] (&quot;Ninth of Av&quot;) the saddest day on the Jewish calendar mourning the destruction of both the [[First Temple|First]] and the [[Second Temple]]s in [[Jerusalem]].

In [[Christianity]] it is traditionally read during [[Tenebrae]] of the [[Holy Triduum]].

==Name==
It is called in the Hebrew canon '' 'Eikhah,'' meaning &quot;How,&quot; being the formula for the commencement of a song of wailing. It is the first word of the book (see 2 Sam. 1:19-27). The [[Septuagint]] adopted the name rendered &quot;Lamentations&quot; (or &quot;Threnoi Hieremiou&quot;, abbreviated &quot;Thren.&quot; in some Latin commentaries, from the Greek ''threnoi'' = Hebrew ''qinoth'') now in common use, to denote the character of the book, in which the prophet mourns over the desolations brought on Jerusalem and the Holy Land by the [[Chaldeans]]. In the Hebrew Bible (the Tanakh) it is placed among the [[Ketuvim]], the ''Writings''.&lt;ref name=Easton&gt;{{cite book |title=The Bible Dictionary: Your Biblical Reference Book |edition=Forgotten Books |url=http://www.forgottenbooks.org |last= Easton |first= Matthew George |authorlink=Matthew George Easton |year=1897 |publisher= Thomas Nelson |isbn= 978-1605060965 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Authorship==
{{Books of the Old Testament}}
[[Image:Jeremiah lamenting.jpg|left|thumbnail|&quot;Jeremiah Lamenting the Destruction of Jerusalem&quot; by [[Rembrandt van Rijn|Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn]].]]
According to Jewish and Christian traditions, authorship is assigned to the [[Prophet]] [[Jeremiah (prophet)|Jeremiah]], who was ministering the Word of God during the conquest of [[Jerusalem]] by [[Nebuchadnezzar II of Babylon|Nebuchadnezzar]], during which the  [[Temple in Jerusalem|First Temple]] was destroyed and [[Zedekiah|King Zedekiah]] was taken prisoner (cf. 2 Kings 24-25, Jer. 39:1-10 and Jer. 52). In the [[Septuagint]] and the [[Vulgate]] the Lamentations are placed directly after the Prophet.

It is said that Jeremiah retired to a cavern outside the Damascus gate, where he wrote this book. That cavern is still pointed out by tour guides. &quot;In the face of a rocky hill, on the western side of the city, the local belief has placed 'the grotto of Jeremiah.' There, in that fixed attitude of grief which [[Michelangelo]] has immortalized, the prophet may well be supposed to have mourned the fall of his country&quot; ([[Arthur Penrhyn Stanley]], ''History of the Jewish Church'').

However, the strict acrostic style of four of the five poems is not found at all in the [[Book of Jeremiah]] itself and Jeremiah's name is not found anywhere in the book itself (nor any other name, for that matter), so authorship of Lamentations is disputed. The Book of Chronicles says that Jeremiah did write a lament on the death of [[King Josiah]].&lt;ref&gt;2 Chronicles 35:25&lt;/ref&gt; The work is probably based on the older Mesopotamian genre of the &quot;city lament&quot;, of which the [[Lament for Ur]] is among the oldest and best-known.

According to F. W. Dobbs-Allsopp, &quot;the widely observed unity of form and point of view... and general resemblance in linguistic detail throughout the sequence are broadly suggestive of the work of a single author,&quot; though other scholars see Lamentations as the work of multiple authors.&lt;ref&gt;Dobbs-Allsopp, F. W. ''Lamentations'' (Louisville: John Knox, 2002), 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Setting==
Most commentators see Lamentations as reflecting the period immediately following the destruction of [[Jerusalem]] in 586 BC,&lt;ref&gt;[[Brevard Childs|Childs, Brevard S.]] ''Introduction to the Old Testament as Scripture'' (London: SCM, 1979), 593.&lt;/ref&gt; though Provan argues for an ahistorical interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;Provan, Iain W. &quot;Reading Texts Against an Historical Background: The Case of Lamentations,&quot; ''SJOT'' 1/1990, 138.&lt;/ref&gt; Many elements of the lament are borne out in the historical narrative in [[Books of Kings|2 Kings]] concerning the fall of Jerusalem: Jerusalem lying in ruins (Lamentations 2:2 and 2 Kings 25:9), enemies entering the city (Lamentations 4:12 and 2 Kings 24:11), people going into exile (Lamentations 1:3 and 2 Kings 24:14) and the sanctuary being plundered (Lamentations 1:10 and 2 Kings 24:13). On the other hand, [[Babylon]] is never mentioned in Lamentations, though this could simply be to make the point that the judgment comes from God, and is a consequence of Judah disobeying him.

==Date==
Lamentations was probably composed soon after 586 [[Common Era|BC]]. Kraus argues that &quot;the whole song stands so near the events that one feels everywhere as if the terrible pictures of the destruction stand still immediately before the eyes of the one lamenting.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Cited in Provan, 133.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==
The book consists of five separate poems. In chapter 1 the prophet dwells on the manifold miseries oppressed by which the city sits as a solitary widow weeping sorely. In chapter 2 these miseries are described in connection with national sins and acts of God. Chapter 3 speaks of hope for the people of God. The chastisement would only be for their good; a better day would dawn for them. Chapter 4 laments the ruin and desolation that had come upon the city and temple, but traces it only to the people's sins. Chapter 5 is a prayer that Zion's reproach may be taken away in the repentance and recovery of the people.&lt;ref name=Easton/&gt;

==Structure==
The first four poems (chapters) are [[acrostic]]s, like some of the Psalms (25, 34, 37, 119), i.e., each verse begins with a letter of the Hebrew alphabet taken in order. The first, second, and fourth have each twenty-two verses, the number of the letters in the Hebrew alphabet. The third has sixty-six verses, in which each three successive verses begin with the same letter. The fifth is not acrostic, but also has twenty-two verses.&lt;ref name=Easton/&gt; In the second, third and fourth chapters, the order of the 16th letter (ע) and the 17th (פ) is reversed.

==Use==
Readings, chantings, and choral settings, of the book of Lamentations, are used in the Christian religious service known as the [[Tenebrae (Maundy)|Tenebrae]] (Latin for ''darkness''). In the Church of England, readings from Lamentations are used at [[Morning Prayer (Anglican)|Morning]] and [[Evening Prayer (Anglican)|Evening Prayer]] on the Monday and Tuesday of [[Holy Week]], and at Evening Prayer on Good Friday.

The Book of Lamentations is recited annually on the Tisha b'Av, the anniversary of the destruction of both of the Jewish Temples as well as numerous other unfavorable days in Jewish history.

At the [[Western Wall|&quot;Wailing Wall&quot;]] in the [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Old City of Jerusalem]], &quot;the Jews assemble every Friday afternoon to bewail the downfall of the holy city, kissing the stone wall and watering it with their tears. They repeat from their well-worn Hebrew Bibles and prayer-books the Lamentations of Jeremiah and suitable Psalms.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Schaff, Philip quoted in {{cite book |title=The Bible Dictionary: Your Biblical Reference Book |edition=Forgotten Books|url=http://www.forgottenbooks.org |last= Easton |first= Matthew George |authorlink=Matthew George Easton |year=1897 |publisher= Thomas Nelson |isbn= 978-1605060965 |page= 387 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Coptic Orthodox Church]] chapter three is chanted on the twelfth hour of the [[Good Friday]] service, that commemorates the burial of Jesus.

==Additional historical and cultural context==
Most modern day biblical scholars assert that the '''Book of Lamentations''' was written by one or more authors in [[Judea|Judah]], shortly after the [[Babylonian]] conquest of [[Jerusalem]] in 586 BCE;&lt;ref&gt;Coogan, Michael D.: ''A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament'', pp. 312, 313. New York: Oxford University Press, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and was penned as a response to [[Babylonian Exile]], the intense suffering of the people of [[Jew|Judah]], and the complete and utter destruction of [[Jerusalem]].&lt;ref&gt;Lemke, Werner E. &amp; O’Connor, Kathleen &quot;Introduction to Lamentations&quot;, in: Meeks, Wayne A., et al. (eds.) ''The HarperCollins Study Bible'' San Francisco, Calif.: HarperSanFrancisco, 2006; p. 1086.&lt;/ref&gt; Werner E. Lemke and Kathleen O’Connor point out “Lamentations is probably the work of a survivor (or survivors) of the nation’s destruction who poured out sorrow, anger and dismay after the city’s traumatic defeat and occupation by the [[Babylonians]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lemke and O’Connor, 2006. 1086&quot;&gt;Lemke 2006, p. 1086&lt;/ref&gt;

The theological views that led to its author(s) writing the '''Book of Lamentations''' emanated from the cultural and religious attitudes of the people of [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]] in the 6th and 7th centuries BCE and was probably also influenced by non-biblical sources which originated from the cultural and religious attitudes of Judah's neighbors of differing religions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coogan, 2009. 312&quot;&gt;Coogan, 2009. 312&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Book of Lamentations''' reflects the theological and biblical view that what happened to [[Jerusalem]] was a deserved punishment; and its destruction was instigated by their god for the communal sins of the people.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coogan, 2009. 312&quot;/&gt;
This theological viewpoint was also widespread among Judah’s neighbors of differing religions who believed the destruction of a particular city could be attributed to the city’s '''deity''' who was punishing the city for some communal sin or wrongdoing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coogan, 2009. 312&quot;/&gt;

The destruction of cities by foreign invaders, and its resulting catastrophic suffering, unfortunately, was very common in the ancient Near East and,&lt;ref&gt;Coogan, 2009. 313&lt;/ref&gt; therefore, we can observe examples of the [[lament]] form/genre concerning destroyed cities and temples from extra-biblical sources,&lt;ref name=&quot;Coogan, 2009. 312&quot;/&gt; particularly from early [[Sumerian Literature]] dating to the late third and early second millennia BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Lemke; O’Connor, 2006. 1086&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, from [[Sumerian Literature]] we can see the same Genre that we see in the Book of Lamentations of the '''Funeral Dirge''' and [[Lament]] reflected in the '''Sumerian Lament''': '''Lamentation over the Destruction of Sumer and Ur''' which depicts the destruction of the cities of [[Sumer]] and [[Ur]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lemke and O’Connor, 2006. 1086&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Coogan, 2009. 312&quot;/&gt;  Yet, as Lemke and O’Connor point out, '''The Book of Lamentations''', while adapting several traditional literary, historical, and cultural Near Eastern elements, is a unique literary composition, scripted to a specific historical situation, in response to an historical catastrophe, addressing the survivors of this catastrophe in a distinctive religious context.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lemke and O’Connor, 2006. 1086&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Secondtempleplan.jpg|thumb|350px|The Visionary Ezekiel Temple plan drawn by the 19th century French architect and Bible scholar Charles Chipiez.]]

The '''Book of Ezekiel''' is the third of the [[Latter Prophets]] in the [[Hebrew Bible]], following the books of [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] and [[book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]] and preceding the [[Book of the Twelve]]. (The order is somewhat different in the Christian [[Old Testament]]). It derives its name from, and records the visions of, the 6th century priest and prophet [[Ezekiel]].

According to the book the prophet, exiled in Babylon, experienced a series of seven visions during the twenty-two years from 593 to 571 BCE, a period which spans the final destruction of Jerusalem in 586. The visions, and the book, are structured around three themes: (1) judgment on Israel (chapters 1-24); (2) judgment on the nations (chapters 25-32); and future blessings for Israel (chapters 33-48).&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com.au/books?id=Z9zLXRhNl9MC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+prophetic+literature:+an+introduction++By+David+L.+Petersen&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=x2l4xWqd5q&amp;sig=dxUaoRtrkNXw5NHPlCsLLMIe4D0&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=SuIrTZaqOYOAvgPcqpmQCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false David L. Petersen, &quot;The prophetic literature: an introduction&quot; (Westminster John Knox Press, 2002)] p.140&lt;/ref&gt;

The frequent use of vivid, symbolic language has much in common with the [[Book of Revelation]] in the [[New Testament]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NIBD&quot;&gt;[[Ronald F. Youngblood]], [[F. F. Bruce]], R.

The Book of Ezekiel describes itself as the words of the [[Ezekiel]] ben-Buzi, a priest living in exile in the city of [[Babylon]] between 593 and 571 BC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com.au/books?id=6P9YEd9lXeAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=A+history+of+prophecy+in+Israel&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ODjnuEMkQu&amp;sig=Ht77xNRi-4RFGJaZlbxL4SBIsX8&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=BYIlTeGjHoT0vQPdyNGlAg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Joseph Blenkinsopp, &quot;A History of Prophecy in Israel&quot; (Westminster John Knox Press, 1996)] p.167&lt;/ref&gt; The various manuscripts, however, differ markedly from each other, and it is clear that the book has been subjected to extensive editing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com.au/books?id=6P9YEd9lXeAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=A+history+of+prophecy+in+Israel&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ODjnuEMkQu&amp;sig=Ht77xNRi-4RFGJaZlbxL4SBIsX8&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=BYIlTeGjHoT0vQPdyNGlAg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Joseph Blenkinsopp, &quot;A History of Prophecy in Israel&quot; (Westminster John Knox Press, 1996)] p.166&lt;/ref&gt; While Ezekiel himself may have been responsible for some of this revision, there is general agreement that the book as we have it today is the product of a highly-educated [[priestly]] circle that owed allegiance to the historical Ezekiel and was closely associated with the Temple.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com.au/books?id=6P9YEd9lXeAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=A+history+of+prophecy+in+Israel&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ODjnuEMkQu&amp;sig=Ht77xNRi-4RFGJaZlbxL4SBIsX8&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=BYIlTeGjHoT0vQPdyNGlAg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Joseph Blenkinsopp, &quot;A History of Prophecy in Israel&quot; (Westminster John Knox Press, 1996)] pp.167-168&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical background ==
[[File:Yad Vashem Memorial to survivors by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Monument to [[Holocaust survivors]] at [[Yad Vashem]] in [[Jerusalem]]; the quote is Ezekiel 37:14.]]

Ezekiel was born into a priestly family of Jerusalem c.623 BCE, during the reign of the reforming king [[Josiah]]. Prior to this time, Judah had been a vassal of the [[Assyria]]n empire, but the rapid decline of Assyria after c.630 led Josiah to assert his independence and institute a religious reform stressing loyalty to [[Yahweh]], the national god. Josiah was killed in 609 and Judah became a vassal of the new regional power, the [[Babylonian empire]]. In 597, following a rebellion against Babylon, Ezekiel was among the large group of Judeans taken into captivity by the Babylonians. He appears to have spent the rest of his life in Mesopotamia. A further deportation of Jews from Jerusalem to Babylon occurred in 586 when a second unsuccessful rebellion resulted in the destruction of the city and its Temple and the exile of the remaining elements of the royal court, including the last scribes and priests. The various dates given in the book suggest that Ezekiel was 25 when he went into exile, 30 when he received his prophetic &quot;call&quot;, and 52 at the time of the last vision c.571.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com.au/books?id=liEw0D4Va2YC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Prophets++Watson+E.+Mills&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=uIbjLKfBJ-&amp;sig=M4vueO06dMBAmyOGJAw_Fo8cU6g&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Y1VOTe7qC5CYvAONq7TsDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Joel F. Drinkard Jr, ''Ezekiel'', in Watson E. Mills and Richard F. Wilson (eds), &quot;The Prophets&quot; (Mercer University Press, 1995)] pp.160-161&lt;/ref&gt;

== Content ==
The book opens with a vision of [[YHWH|Yahweh]], the [[God of Israel]], moves on to anticipate the destruction of Jerusalem and the Temple, explains this as Yahweh's punishment, and closes with the promise of a new beginning and a new Temple.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com.au/books?id=bKM_VJt9e3kC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Introduction+to+the+Prophets++By+Paul+L.+Redditt&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=F02w-Qwl6o&amp;sig=vuhRQKnDKih5c4ai1ybB-mwF8gE&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=TrAyTciPBYP4vwOCoMjcCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Paul L. Redditt, &quot;Introduction to the Prophets&quot; (Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2008)] p. 148&lt;/ref&gt;

#Inaugural vision (Ezekiel 1:1–3:27): Yahweh approaches Ezekiel as the divine warrior, riding in his [[Merkabah|battle chariot]].  The chariot is drawn by four living creatures each having four faces (of a man, a lion, an ox, and an eagle), and four wings. Beside each &quot;living creature&quot; is a &quot;wheel within a wheel,&quot; with &quot;tall and awesome&quot; rims full of eyes all around. Yahweh commissions Ezekial to be a prophet and a &quot;watchman&quot; in Israel: &quot;Son of man, I am sending you to the Israelites.&quot; (2:3)
#Judgment on Jerusalem and Judah (Ezekiel 4:1–24:27) and on the nations (Ezekiel 25:1–32:32): Yahweh warns of the certain destruction of [[Jerusalem]] and the devastation of the nations that have troubled his people, the [[Ammon]]ites, [[Moab]]ites, [[Edom]]ites and [[Philistines]], the Phoenician cities of [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]] and [[Sidon]], and [[Egypt]].
#Building a new city  (Ezekiel 33:1–48:35): The Jewish exile will come to an end, a new city and new Temple will be built, and the Israelites will be gathered and blessed as never before.

== The &quot;Glory of YHWH&quot; ==

The phrase “[[K-B-D|glory]] of [[YHWH]],” found in Ezekiel, describes the  presence of the [[God of Israel]] which filled the Temple.  The “glory of YHWH” was also revealed in the form of light-filled cloud which accompanied the Israelites during the Exodus to the Promised Land. This same divine presence is on the move again; this time accompanying the Babylonian exile.

In Ezekiel’s vision, Ezekiel sees the &quot;glory of YHWH&quot; leaving the Temple, from the Holy of Holies to the gate, and moving toward Babylon (Eze. 9-11).  This refers to YHWH going into exile with his people leaving Jerusalem.

In his vision of the new Temple, Ezekiel sees the glory of God entering the Temple and filling the Temple (Eze. 43.2-5).  Upon the return from Babylonia and the restoration of the Temple, YHWH will once again dwell in the new Temple as he had in the Temple built by Solomon.&lt;ref&gt;Michael D. Coogan, A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament (New York: Oxford, 2009), 321-322.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influence ==
Ezekiel's literary influence can be seen in the later apocalyptic writings of Daniel and Zechariah. He is specifically mentioned by Ben Sirah (a writer of the Hellenistic period who listed the &quot;great sages&quot; of Israel) and 4 Maccabees (1st century CE), and by the 1st century CE historian [[Joseph]], who says that the prophet wrote two books. He may have had in mind the [[Apocryphon of Ezekiel]], a 1st century BCE text that expands on the doctrine of resurrection. Ezekiel is not widely represented in the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]], but his influence there was profound, most notably in the [[Temple Scroll]] with its temple plans, and the defence of the [[Zadok]]ite priesthood in the [[Damascus Document]].&lt;ref&gt;Block (1997), p.43&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] 21-23, as in the closing visions of Ezekiel, the prophet is transported to a high mountain, where a heavenly messenger measures the symmetrical new Jerusalem, complete with high walls and twelve gates, the dwelling-place of God, producing a state of perfect well-being for his people.&lt;ref&gt;Block (1998), p.502&lt;/ref&gt; Other references to this book are also found in the [[New Testament]].

      <comment>/* Big Brother series */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">'''''Big Brother''''' is a television show in which a group of people live together in a large house, isolated from the outside world but continuously watched by television cameras. Each series lasts for around three months, and there are usually fewer than 15 participants. The housemates try to win a cash prize by avoiding periodic evictions from the house. The idea for the show is said to have come during a brainstorm session at the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] production house of ''[[John de Mol]] Produkties'' (an independent part of [[Endemol]]) on 4 September 1997. The [[Big Brother 1999 (Netherlands)|first Big Brother broadcast]] was in the [[Netherlands]] in 1999 on the Veronica TV channel. It was picked up by Brazil, Germany, Argentina, Portugal, USA, UK, Spain, Belgium, Sweden, Switzerland, Italy and Indonesia the following year and became a world-wide sensation. Since then it has been a prime-time hit in almost 70 countries. The show's name comes from [[George Orwell]]'s 1949 novel ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'', a [[dystopia]] in which [[Big Brother (1984)|Big Brother]] can always spy on the inhabitants of the [[dictatorship]] he heads through their television sets, with the slogan &quot;''Big Brother is watching you''&quot;.

==Format==
Although each country has made its own adaptations and changes to the format, the general concept has stayed the same: &quot;Housemates&quot; or &quot;Houseguests&quot; are confined to a specially designed house where their every action is recorded by cameras and microphones at all times and they are not permitted any contact with the outside world.

In most versions, at regular intervals (normally once weekly, as introduced in the UK version, although in most early series it was every two weeks), the housemates are invited to vote to have one of a number of nominated housemates evicted from the house. In some cases two housemates may be evicted simultaneously (a &quot;double eviction&quot;), or rarely, no housemates will be removed for that week. At the end of the game, the last remaining housemate is declared the winner of that particular series and receives prizes, often including a large amount of money, a car, a vacation and (in some editions) a house.

From a sociological and demographic perspective, this format allows the opportunity for analysis of how people react when forced into close confinement with people who lie outside their [[comfort zone]], since they may hold different opinions or ideals from other contestants, or simply belong to a different group of people than a contestant normally interacts with. Indeed, the format is ideally suited to such analysis because the viewer is afforded the opportunity to see how a person reacts on the outside through the constant recording of their actions and also what they feel on the inside through the ''Diary Room/Confession Room''. The results can range from violent or angry confrontations to genuine and tender connections (often including romantic interludes), providing entertainment to the public.

Besides living together under continuous observation, which is the major attraction of the contest, the program relies on four basic props: The stripped-bare back-to-basics environment in which they live, the evictions, the weekly tasks and competitions set by ''Big Brother'' and the &quot;Diary/Confession Room,&quot; in which the housemates individually convey their thoughts, feelings, and frustrations and reveal their nominees for eviction.

In the first season of most series of ''Big Brother'', the house that the housemates had to live in was very basic. Although essential amenities such as running water, furniture and a limited ration of food were provided, luxury items were often forbidden. This added a [[survivalist]] element to the show, increasing the potential for social tension within the house. Nowadays, almost all series provide a modern house for the contest, with a jacuzzi, sauna, VIP suite, loft and other luxuries.

The housemates are required to do housework, and are set tasks by the producers of the show, who communicate with the housemates via the omnipresent authority figure known to them only as &quot;Big Brother.&quot; The tasks are designed to test their teamwork abilities and community spirit, and in some countries the housemates' shopping budget or weekly allowance often depends on the outcome of any given tasks. The housemates have a weekly allowance with which they can buy food and other essentials.

At regular intervals, the housemates each privately nominate a number of fellow housemates that they wish to see evicted from the house. The housemates with the most nomination points are then announced and viewers are given the opportunity to [[televoting|vote via telephone]] for whom they wish to see evicted. The only known exception to this process is the American version, in which the housemates themselves vote to evict each other. After the votes are tallied, the &quot;evictee&quot; leaves the house and is interviewed live by the host of the show, usually in front of a studio audience.

The series is notable for involving the [[Internet]]. Although the show typically broadcasts daily updates in the evening (which are sometimes criticized for their heavy editing), viewers can also watch a continuous, 24-hour feed from multiple cameras on the web. These websites were highly successful, even after some national series started charging for access to the video stream. In some countries, Internet broadcasting was supplemented by updates via email, [[Wireless Application Protocol|WAP]] and [[Text messaging|SMS]]. The House is even shown live on [[satellite television]], although in some countries, such as the UK, with a 10-15 minute delay to allow libelous or unacceptable content (such as references to people who are not taking part in the program and have therefore not consented to have personal information about them broadcast) to be removed.

Despite derision from many critics, the show has been a commercial success around the world. The voyeuristic nature of the show, in which contestants volunteer to surrender their privacy in return for minor celebrity status and a comparatively small cash prize, has attracted much scorn.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbcgreece&quot;&gt;{{cite news|first=Panos|last=Polyzoidis|title=Greece's Big Brother row|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1889048.stm|publisher=BBC News|date=2002-03-23|accessdate=2007-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; On numerous occasions, participants in the various series have become sexually involved with each other, sometimes engaging in [[sexual intercourse|intercourse]] in front of Big Brother's cameras. This recorded material is typically not broadcast due to its explicit nature, as in the Australian and American editions. Other editions, however, such as the German and British versions, do broadcast it. The Internet stream also captures such moments, which has led to some controversy, with certain jurisdictions such as [[Greece]] attempting to have the show removed from the airwaves.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbcgreece&quot;/&gt;

Most international versions of the show remain quite similar to each other in that their main format remains true to the original [[fly on the wall]], observational style, with the emphasis being on human relationships. This is taken to the extent that contestants are forbidden from discussing nominations or voting strategy altogether. The [[United States|U.S.]] version, however, has since 2001 taken on a significantly different format from the others in their second season, with a far stronger emphasis on strategy, competition and voting.

===Isolation of contestants===
Big Brother contestants are, for the most part, isolated within the house. They have no access to television, radio or the internet and are not allowed routine communication with the outside world. (In special instances the producers have allowed contestants to view televisised events; in the UK series the housemates were allowed to watch a 2002 World Cup match, the [[Inauguration of Barack Obama]], and the 2010 World Cup 2nd round game England versus Germany, sometimes as a reward for winning a challenge). In some shows books and writing materials are also forbidden. Sometimes in series with this rule an exception is made for religious materials such as the [[Bible]], [[Torah]] or [[Qur'an]]. Some versions (including the British version) ban all writing implements, extending to any item that can be used to write such as lipstick or eyeliner. Despite the fact that the housemates are generally isolated, on some occasions some houseguests are allowed to exit the house as part of tasks. Housemates are sometimes permitted to exit the house in case of emergencies but must return within 24 hours to avoid being eliminated from the game.

Contestants have regularly scheduled interactions with the show's host (mostly on eviction nights). Throughout each day the program's producer, via the &quot;Big Brother&quot; voice, issues directives and commands to contestants. Some versions of the show allow private counselling sessions with a psychologist. These are allowed at any time, often conducted by telephone from the Diary Room.

Contact from the outside world has taken place in the form of fly-overs by planes carrying banners with messages for the contestants. Whenever these planes are discovered by producers, the house guests are ordered indoors by Big Brother in an effort to prevent them from reading the banners.

===Variations in the format===

* In the [[Big Brother 2002 (UK)|third UK series]], Big Brother set live tasks for the housemate on a Saturday night in order to win treats. This format was discontinued in the [[Big Brother 2004 (UK)|fifth series]] due to poor ratings. This format has been used in [[Big Brother Australia|Australia]] in the form of [[Big Brother Australia#Friday Night Live|Friday Night Live]].
* The [[Big Brother 2004 (UK)|fifth UK edition]] introduced the &quot;Evil&quot; touch, whereby the character of Big Brother became almost a villain. Big Brother was establishing punishments and was proposing hard tasks and secret tricks. This was also seen in [[Australia]], [[Belgium]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Canada]], [[Croatia]], [[Finland]], [[Germany]], [[Greece]], [[Italy]], [[Netherlands]], [[Pacific]], [[Scandinavia]], [[Serbia]], [[Spain]], [[Thailand]], [[Philippines]] and [[Mexico]].
*The [[Big Brother 2005 (UK)|sixth UK series]] introduced secret missions where housemate would be able to win luxuries if they completed a secret task set by Big Brother.
*In the [[Big Brother 2006 (UK)|seventh UK series]], Big Brother became &quot;twisted.&quot; Every week, housemates' mental states were put to the test as Big Brother tried to break them. As a result of this, many housemates broke down.
*The [[Big Brother 2007 (UK)|eighth UK series]] saw an all-female house. However, three days later, one male housemate entered. The same twist was used in [[Big Brother 4 (Bulgaria)|Big Brother 4 Bulgaria]]. Big Brother Africa 4 used the same twist using an all male launch show instead of females.
* Since BB2, The [[Big Brother (UK)|UK series]] always opens with a twist which have included the public being able to choose the final housemate out of 3 possibilities ([[Big Brother 2001 (UK)|BB2]]), the public voting for a housemate to leave during the first week and then the housemates choosing between the two housemates with the least number of votes ([[Big Brother 2002 (UK)|BB3]]), First Night Nominations ([[Big Brother 2003 (UK)|BB4]]), Suit Case Nominations ([[Big Brother 2004 (UK)|BB5]]), Unlucky Housemate 13 ([[Big Brother 2005 (UK)|BB6]]), Big Brother Hood ([[Big Brother 2006 (UK)|BB7]]), an all-female House and the first inclusion of twins as contestants ([[Big Brother 2007 (UK)|BB8]]), the first couple to enter as housemates and set a secret task to hide their real relationship ([[Big Brother 2008 (UK)|BB9]]), all &quot;housemates&quot; really being &quot;non housemates&quot; who had to earn their housemate status ([[Big Brother 2009 (UK)|BB10]]), a mole entering the House with an &quot;Impossible Task&quot; ([[Big Brother 2010 (UK)|BB11]]), [[Jackie Stallone]] entering a house containing her son's ex-wife ([[Celebrity Big Brother 2005 (UK)|CBB3]]), entrance of a non-celebrity in a celebrity edition ([[Celebrity Big Brother 2006 (UK)|CBB4]]) [[Jade Goody]]'s family announced to be visiting. ([[Celebrity Big Brother 2007 (UK)|CBB5]]). In 2009 during the [[Celebrity Big Brother 2009 (UK)|sixth celebrity series]], [[LaToya Jackson]] was first to enter and walked straight into the bedrooms - which are usually locked until everyone has arrived - and entered a private bedroom she put her bag on the bed to claim it as her own, it was assumed this was pre-arranged [http://www.mirror.co.uk/celebs/news/2009/01/05/celebrity-big-brother-exclusive-la-toya-jackson-s-diva-demands-115875-21016252/] , [[Terry Christian]] became Head Of House - which had been used in the latter weeks of the previous non-celebrity series - and had to choose three housemates to face the first eviction, which the others later voted to save one of the nominees, [[Ben Adams]], leaving [[Lucy Pinder]] and eventual winner [[Ulrika Johnsson]] to face the first eviction. In the [[Big Brother 2009 (UK)|summer series of 2009]] the house at first was empty with only crates to sit on and none of the new arrivals were given housemate status, and had to earn it by doing tasks, some of which were minor sacrifices, the most notable were Noirin Kelly shaving off her eyebrows and drawing a [[mustache]] and [[glasses]] on her face, which she had to do for almost three weeks until she won a chance to stop doing it, Freddie Fisher and eventual winner Sophie Reade changed their names by [[deedpoll]] to Halfwit and Dogface respectively, they were addressed by these names by Big Brother for ten weeks - although their fellow housemates could refer to them by their original names except during nominations - they were given a present by Big Brother in Week 10 to have their original names back. On Day 4 the six people who had not received housemate status were put up for a public vote, the person with the least votes - which turned out to be Beinazir Lasharie - had to leave immediately, the house was then transformed into looking like a Big Brother house. Other countries such as [[Bulgaria]] and the [[United States]] (and previously [[Australia]]) have now started using these opening night twists.
*The [[Big Brother 2004 (UK)|fifth UK edition]] introduced &quot;Fake evictions&quot; where one or two housemates are &quot;evicted&quot;; however, unbeknownst to the housemates, they have in fact not been evicted. The housemate/s usually are put into a secret house where numerous twists happen. In the [[Big Brother 2007 (UK)|eighth UK Series]] one housemate was evicted, interviewed, and then sent straight back into the house. The housemates in the house got to see everything live, though.
*In [[France]] and [[Canada]], the format has been developed using couples. 12 single people stay in the same house until only the winning couple are left.
*[[Big Brother (U.S.)|''Big Brother'' USA]] currently uses a different set of rules that began with the second season (the first season used the traditional format). Nominations are done by one houseguest, the [[Big Brother (U.S.)#Head of Household (HoH)|Head of Household (HoH)]] and the houseguests vote for which nominee to evict, not the viewers. The third season introduced the Power of Veto, where a houseguest can save a nominee causing the Head of Household to name a replacement nominee. It's been adapted in [[Brazil]] and [[Africa]] and since then some countries modified their nominations rules.
*The [[Big Brother 8 (U.S.)|eighth American season]] introduced &quot;America's Player,&quot; a houseguest that is given assignments, unknown to the other houseguests, through votes from the viewing public. Included in the public voting is which nominated houseguest America's Player should vote off and campaign to get evicted. (Dan was &quot;America's Player&quot; on Big Brother 10 (U.S) This was also seen in the [[Pinoy Big Brother: Teen Edition Plus|second Teen Edition]] and [[Pinoy Big Brother: Double Up|third regular season]] of the [[Pinoy Big Brother|Philippine version]] as the &quot;House Player.&quot;
*The [[Big Brother (Netherlands)#Season 3|third Dutch edition]] introduced the notion of &quot;The Battle,&quot; in which the house is separated into a luxurious half and a poor half, with two teams of housemates constantly fighting for time in the luxurious half. Separated houses have also been used in:

*In [[Germany]] a new version of the show started: ''Big Brother - Das Dorf'' (''Big Brother - The Village''). It was the sixth season and started the same day season 5 ended. This was the first version supposed to run for years (without a predetermined end). It was set in a small artificial village including a church tower, a marketplace, 3 houses, 3 working areas (farm, car garage, dressmaking, a matcharena, a pub, a fitness room, and later a small hotel, into which celebrities from the real world could move). The season ended after 363 days in February 2006 because of low ratings. In season seven, RTL II switched back to a traditional version.
*The fourth Greek season introduced a new element: the mother. In ''Big Mother'', nine housemates take part in the game with their mothers, with whom they must coexist during the contest. The &quot;mamas&quot; were not able to win the prize but they would stay with their children until their eviction. However, this proved to be a failure with the show's audience and the show switched back to the traditional ''Big Brother'' format in mid-season. This concept, in modified form, was used in the [[Pinoy Big Brother: Teen Edition Plus|second Philippine Teen edition]], wherein the guardians. the housemates' kins, had a separate winner.
*In the tenth week of [[Big Brother 2006 (UK)|Seventh UK season]], the housemates were paired with their &quot;best friend&quot; in the house and had to nominate and face eviction as couples. The [[Big Brother 9 (U.S.)|ninth American season]] took this format and added a romantic aspect, by pairing the Housemates up and having them compete as couples chosen by their compatibility to each other.
*The [[Big Brother Brasil 9|ninth Brazilian season]] featured the &quot;Bubble,&quot; a glass house built inside a [[shopping mall]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]] where 4 housemate-wannabes lived for a week until 2 of them were voted to enter the actual household. Later in the same season, a new &quot;Bubble&quot; was built inside the Big Brother household, with another 2 housemates living inside it for a week until they were voted in and the glass house dismantled.
*Introduced in the [[Big Brother 5 (U.S.)|fifth season]] of the American series, several countries have included twins, and in some cases triplets, in their shows. Series that have used Housemates who are twins or triplets are:
** '''[[Big Brother 5 (U.S.)|USA, 2004]]''', [[Adria Montgomery-Klein and Natalie Montgomery-Carroll]], 7th (Adria) and 8th (Natalie) Evicted, Used Name: &quot;Adria.&quot;
** '''[[Big Brother Australia 2005|Australia, 2005]]''', [[David Mathew|David]] and [[Greg Mathew|Greg Matthew]], 14th Evicted (David) and Winner (Greg, although the prize money was split), Used Name: &quot;Logan&quot; (Middle name of both Twins).
** '''[[Big Brother Germany (Season 6)|Germany, 2005-2006]]''', Beate and Birgit, 26th Evicted (Beate) and 33rd Evicted (Birgit).
** '''[[Big Brother 3 (Bulgaria)|Bulgaria, 2006]]''', Lyubov, Nadejda, and Vyara Stancheva, 7th (Nadejda) and 9th (Vyara) Evicted, Winner (Lyubov), Used Name: &quot;Vyara.&quot;
** '''[[Big Brother 2007 (UK)|UK, 2007]]''', [[Samanda|Amanda and Sam Marchant]], second place (both were treated separately until Day 68 when they became one). They were then known in the media as [[Samanda]]
** '''[[Secret Story (TV series)|France, 2007]]''', Marjorie, Cyrielle and Johanna Bluteau, Winners (They competed as a team).
** '''[[Gran Hermano (Spain)|Spain, 2007]]''', Conchi and Pamela De Los Santos, 2nd Place, Used Name: &quot;Rosa.&quot;
** '''[[Big Brother (Poland)|Poland, 2007]]''', Aneta and Martyna Bielecka, 4th Evicted (They were discovered as twins), Used Name: &quot;Martyna.&quot;
** '''[[Bigg Boss (Season 2)#Sana Wadiwala|India, 2008]]''', Sana and Alina, 4th Evicted (Sana was introduced as Alina but the housemates soon found her to be different person and both were out at the eviction)
** '''[[Big Brother (Israel)|Israel, 2008]]''', Leon and Boris Schneiderovsky, 1st Evicted (Boris) and 5th Place (Leon).
** '''[[Big Brother (Africa)|Africa, 2009]]''', Edward and Erastus Moongo, currently in the house playing as separate housemates.
** '''[[Veliki brat|Serbia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Macedonia and Montenegro, 2009]]''', Admir and Enis Mujabašić, and Violeta and Kristina Raleva.
** '''[[Pinoy Big Brother: Double Up|Philippines, 2009]]''', Kenny &amp; Toffi Santos and JM &amp; JP Lagumbay. The twins in each set originally must switch roles when instructed (only true with the Santos twins after JP's exit, but JM must still assume JP's identity when instructed). JP voluntary exited and JM along with the Santos Twins were forcibly evicted.
** '''[[Secret Story 2010 (Portugal)|Portugal, 2010]]''', Renato and Mário Lima. They have to take turns in the house without the other housemates discover that they are twins. If they succeed they become two housemates, if they don't, both will be up for eviction and one of them will leave. The name used during the turns is Renato. The secret was found on Day 2 and therefore both are up for eviction. On Day 4 Mário was evicted, being the first housemate evicted on the series. Renato was the 5th housemate evicted, on Day 28.
** '''[[Big Brother (Israel)|Israel, 2011]]''', Rinat and Shiran Guitter, 4th Evicted (Shiran) and 5th Evicted (Rinat).
* A variation of the above twist was done in the [[Pinoy Big Brother: Celebrity Edition 2|second Celebrity Edition]] of the Philippine version wherein two housemates related by profession or as familial relationships are considered as 2-in-1 housemates wherein they were to play as one housemate until an appointed time.
* In [[Big Brother: Celebrity Hijack|Celebrity Hijack UK]] evicted housemates were given the opportunity to affect the house one last time and had to choose if a &quot;ninja&quot; delivered good or bad gifts to the house. Later that year [[Big Brother Australia 2008]] introduced the 'Housemate Hand Grenade,' where the evicted housemate was given the power to decide which housemate receives a big brother devised penalty.
*[[Big Brother 5 (Bulgaria)|Big Brother 5 Bulgaria]], which started in early 2010 introduced a new family format - ''Big Brother Family''. For the very first time whole families entered the House with their spouses, children and relatives. They received a salary for their stay and the winning family will receive a big cash prize, a car and an apartment.
*[[Big Brother 12 (U.S.)|The twelfth American season]] featured a Saboteur who entered the house to &quot;wreak havoc on their fellow HouseGuests&quot;, with tasks suggested by viewers. The Big Brother Saboteur will not be eligible to win the game, but will be able to receive financial reward if they can reach the halfway point of the game. However, the Saboteur was evicted in the first week by the Houseguests therefore losing the possible reward. Later in the same season Big Brother announced that a new Saboteur may be unleashed in the house, and America voted on who they wanted the new Saboteur to be, and if they accept the offer, they have to act out two week of havoc in the house and if successful for those two weeks, he or she will earn a financial reward.

==Special editions of ''Big Brother''==
===''Celebrity Big Brother'' / ''Big Brother VIP''===
The ''Big Brother'' format has been adapted in some countries in that the housemates are locally known celebrities. These shows are called ''[[Celebrity Big Brother (disambiguation)|Celebrity Big Brother]]'' or ''Big Brother VIP'', depending on where the series is. In some countries, the prize money normally awarded to the winning housemate is donated to a charity, and all celebrities are paid to appear in the show as long as they do not voluntarily leave before their eviction or the end of the series. The rest of the format rules are almost the same as the ones from the original version, although in many occasions they are not so strict due to the exceptional character of the program. The series has been a prime-time hit in many countries and was aired for the first time in 1999, in the [[Netherlands]].

* A second variant appeared in the Netherlands in 2006: ''Hotel Big Brother''. A group of celebrity hoteliers and a ''Big Boss'' run a hotel, collecting money for charity without nominations, evictions or winner.
* A third variant appeared in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] in early 2008: ''[[Big Brother: Celebrity Hijack (UK)|Big Brother: Celebrity Hijack]]'', temporarily replacing the 2007 edition of ''Celebrity Big Brother'' while a racial abuse incident in Celebrity Big Brother 2007 cooled down. Instead of the celebrities playing the role of housemates, the celebrities in fact become Big Brother himself. The celebrities create tasks, hold nominations, and so on. with the help of ''Big Brother''. The housemates of the show are considered by the producers &quot;Britain's most exceptional and extraordinary&quot; 18-21 year olds. The prize for the winner of the series was £50,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;celebhijack&quot;&gt;[http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/B/bb8/news/newsstory.jsp?id=24561 BREAKING BB NEWS] ''Channel 4 - Official Big Brother UK Website'' Retrieved 2007-09-08&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[VIP Brother 3 (Bulgaria)|VIP Brother 3 Bulgaria]] introduced in 2009 an entirely new conception of the show, where the celebrities compete for charity causes, and sometimes they are allowed to leave the House in order to gain money for the given cause, which is different each week.

===Other editions===
The ''Big Brother'' format has been extensively modified in some countries, most often to the point where the housemates are either teenagers or housemates from previous seasons. The winners of these seasons are often eligible to win the prize for themselves, unlike most of the celebrity edition versions.

There are also &quot;test runs&quot; with a group of celebrities or journalists living together in the house during a few days, with the only goal being testing out the house. There are occasions where people who have auditioned for the show are also put in the house, most notably in the [[Big Brother (UK)|British edition]], where many housemates claim to have met before. Series such as these are known to occur in [[Argentina]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Germany]], [[Mexico]], [[Pacific]], [[Philippines]], [[Spain]] and many other countries. In some cases, it is not broadcast, but in others, such as the [[Big Brother (U.S.)|US edition]], it is used as a promotional tool.

'''Bristol City Football Club''' is one of two [[association football|football]] league clubs in [[Bristol]], [[England]] (the other being arch rivals [[Bristol Rovers F.C.|Bristol Rovers]]). They play at [[Ashton Gate stadium|Ashton Gate]], located in the south-west of the City. [[Keith Millen]] is currently the manager of the club. They were promoted to the [[Football League Championship]] in the [[2006-07 in English football|2006–07]] season after finishing second in [[Football League One|League One]] but failed to make a second consecutive promotion to the [[Premier League]] after they were defeated by [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]] in the Championship Play-Offs.

Bristol City won the [[Welsh Cup]] – despite being an [[England|English]] team – in 1934. In 1907 they finished runners-up in Football League Division One, which is their highest-ever final position.

In 1982, Bristol City became the first English team to suffer three consecutive relegations but by 1990 they were back in the old [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]]. Another relegation followed in 1995, when City finished second from bottom in the new [[Football League Division One|Endsleigh League Division One]] and a return to that division three years later lasted just one season. Most of their seasons between 1999 and 2006 were spent challenging for promotion in the upper half of the [[Football League Second Division]].

The club's nickname is &quot;The Robins&quot;, and a [[European Robin|robin]] featured on the club's [[badge]] from 1976 to 1994. Official club merchandise, including replica kits, still has a label showing a robin. An attempt by the club to alter the club's badge was abandoned after the club was criticized fiercely by fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bcfc.co.uk/page/WTPSDetail/0,,10327~633693,00.html |title=City Fans are Crest-Fallen! |publisher=BCFC|date= 1 March 2005 |accessdate=22 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bristol City currently play at [[Ashton Gate stadium]] in the [[Bedminster, Bristol|Ashton/Bedminster]] area of the city of [[Bristol]], which has an all-seater capacity of 21,497. Bristol had been chosen as a host city for the [[England 2018 FIFA World Cup bid|2018 World Cup]], but England were not awarded host nation status. Bristol City plan to build a new 30,000 capacity stadium at Ashton Vale, to be completed in time for the 2012–13 season. The club is affiliated to the [[Somerset County FA]] and [[Gloucestershire County FA]].

==History==
===Early years and early successes (1897–1911)===
The club was founded in 1897, when '''Bristol South End''' turned professional and changed its name to Bristol City, and were admitted into the [[Southern Football League|Southern League]], finishing as runners-up in three of the first four seasons. In 1900 the club merged with local rivals '''Bedminster''', who had been founded as '''Southville''' in 1887. The side joined [[the Football League]] in 1901 and were the only non-London League side south of Birmingham until 1920. Their first game in the Football League was against [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]] at [[Bloomfield Road]] on 7 September 1901. City won 2–0.&lt;ref&gt;Calley, Roy (1992). ''Blackpool: A Complete Record 1887–1992'', Breedon Books Sport&lt;/ref&gt;

They first entered Division One in 1906 as [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] champions, and as newcomers became known as the &quot;Bristol Babies&quot;, a nickname that would last into the thirties. They were runners-up to [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] in their first season in the top flight, and in 1909 reached the [[FA Cup]] final, where they were beaten by [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] at the [[Crystal Palace Sports Centre|Crystal Palace]] in [[London]]. But these achievements were not consistent, and in 1911 City were relegated back to the Second Division. They have not repeated the heights of the 1906–1909 era since, and did not even return to the top flight for 65 years.

===The yo-yo era (1912–1965)===
The 1920s were a rocky time as City bounced between the Second Division and the Southern Section of the Third Division. By the 1930s they had slumped into the lower division, and stayed that way until the Second World War. [[Harry Dolman]] became chairman in 1949, a post he would hold for over 30 years. An engineer who had bought out the firm he worked for, he designed the first set of floodlights installed at Ashton Gate in the early 1950s. The late 1950s were a better time for City, with a five year stay in the Second Division, a league they returned to for a further spell in 1965.

===Back among the elite (1966–1980)===
In 1967, [[Alan Dicks]] was appointed manager, and things gradually began to improve,with promotion to the First Division finally being achieved in 1976, ending a 65-year exile from the top flight.

City's second stint in the top flight was less successful and memorable than the club's first, with 13th position in 1979 being their highest finish during this era. Stars of this era included [[Geoff Merrick]], [[Tom Ritchie]], [[Clive Whitehead]], [[Gerry Gow]], [[Trevor Tainton]] and [[Jimmy Mann (footballer)|Jimmy Mann]].

===Decline and financial ruin (1980–1982)===
In 1980, the City team went back to the Second Division in the first of three relegations, their debt mounted and their losses{{Vague|date=July 2010|reason=Financial or playing stats?}} increased, with two successive relegations following. Thus, in 1982, they both fell into the [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]], and were declared bankrupt. BCFC (1982) Ltd acquired the club's player contracts, and the highly-paid senior players [[Julian Marshall (footballer)|Julian Marshall]], [[Chris Garland]], [[Jimmy Mann (footballer)|Jimmy Mann]], [[Peter Aitken]], Geoff Merrick&lt;!-- no article as of 24 July 2010 --&gt;, [[David Rodgers (footballer)|David Rodgers]], [[Gerry Sweeney]] and [[Trevor Tainton]], who became known as the 'Ashton Gate Eight', each accepted termination of his contract for half the amount due to him.

===Revival (1982–1990)===
City spent two seasons in the Fourth Division before winning promotion under [[Terry Cooper (footballer born 1944)|Terry Cooper]] in 1984. They consolidated themselves in the Third Division during the later part of the 1980s, and in 1990 Cooper's successor [[Joe Jordan (footballer)|Joe Jordan]] achieved promotion as Third Division runners-up. This was easily the most successful footballing year to date for the city of [[Bristol]], as neighbours [[Bristol Rovers F.C.|Bristol Rovers]] were also promoted to the Second Division as champions.

There was a tragedy for the club, however, in that [[1989-90 in English football|promotion campaign]]. In March 1990, two months before the club sealed promotion, striker [[Dean Horrix]] was killed in a car crash barely two weeks after joining the club, and having played three league games for them.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.royals.org/deano.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Back in the second tier (1990–1995)===
Jordan moved to [[Heart of Midlothian F.C.|Heart of Midlothian]] in September 1990, and his successor [[Jimmy Lumsden]] remained in charge for 18 months before making way for [[Denis Smith (footballer)|Denis Smith]]. Smith's first signing was the 20-year-old [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] striker [[Andy Cole]], who was an instant hit with fans and quickly established himself as one of the finest goalscoring talents ever to wear a Bristol City shirt. But he was sold to Newcastle United in February 1993 and later established himself as a world class goalscorer, most prominently with Manchester United, where he collected five [[Premier League]] titles, two [[FA Cup]]s and the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]].

Meanwhile, City remained in the new [[Football League First Division|Division One]] (no longer the Second Division after the creation of the [[Premier League]] in 1992) and Smith moved to [[Oxford United F.C.|Oxford United]] in November 1993. His successor [[Russell Osman]] was sacked within a year, being a very unpopular figure with fans. One of Osman's few successful moments with City came in January 1994 when he led them to a shock 1–0 victory over [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] in the third round of the [[FA Cup]].

Joe Jordan was brought back to [[Ashton Gate stadium|Ashton Gate]] in September 1994, but was unable to prevent relegation to Division Two.

===Promotion and relegation (1995–2000)===
Jordan remained at the helm for two seasons after City's relegation, but left in June 1997 after failing to get them back into Division One. Former Bristol Rovers manager [[John Ward]] took over, and achieved promotion in 1998 as Division Two runners-up. But City struggled back in Division One, and Ward stepped down in October 1998 to be succeeded by [[Benny Lennartsson]]. City were relegated in bottom place and Lennartsson was dismissed in favour of [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]]'s [[Tony Pulis]], who lasted six months before leaving to take over at Portsmouth. During his time at Ashton Gate he was manager of perhaps the worst City side since the one that completed a hat-trick of successive relegations almost 20 years earlier. Coach [[Tony Fawthrop]] took over until the end of the season, when [[Danny Wilson (footballer born 1960)|Danny Wilson]] was appointed. Wilson was arguably the most prominent manager to take charge of a City side since [[Denis Smith (footballer)|Denis Smith]], as he had guided [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]] to promotion to the Premier League in 1997 and [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] to a 12th place finish in 1999.

===The Danny Wilson era (2000–2004)===
City were regular Division Two playoff contenders during Wilson's spell as manager. City failed to reach them in 2002, although Wilson almost took them to automatic promotion, and winning the [[Football League Trophy]] in Cardiff in 2003. The taste of the play-offs was bitter though, losing to rivals [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] 1–0 on aggregate in the semi-final. In his final year – 2004 – they reached the final, but lost to [[Brighton &amp; Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton &amp; Hove Albion]]. He was sacked within days and replaced by veteran player [[Brian Tinnion]].

===Disappointment under Brian Tinnion (2004–2005)===
City just failed to make the playoffs in [[2004-2005 in English football|Tinnion's first season]] as manager, finishing seventh, and he stepped down in September 2005 after a poor start to the season culminating in a 7–1 defeat at the hands of [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]]. City's form had slumped despite the addition of high profile players including [[Marcus Stewart]] and [[Michael Bridges]]. [[Yeovil Town F.C.|Yeovil Town]] manager [[Gary Johnson (footballer)|Gary Johnson]] was recruited as his successor.

===Revival under Gary Johnson (September 2005 – May 2007)===
[[Image:Ashton Gate invasion.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Pitch invasion at [[Ashton Gate stadium|Ashton Gate]] after securing promotion]]
&lt;!-- Missing image removed: [[Image:Gary Johnson BI.jpg|thumb|left|Gary Johnson]] --&gt;Johnson arrived in September 2005, making the move from Yeovil Town, with whom he had gained two promotions. His first game in charge (only hours after meeting the squad) saw City win away at Brentford 3–2. After a short spell of decent results, City were plunged into the relegation mire, enduring a club record of nine successive defeats, leaving them at the foot of League One. Much criticism was aimed at Gary Johnson at this time; the Chairman of Bristol City Supporters Club labelled him a 'Conference Manager' and contended that he was 'totally out of his depth'. The run was brought to an end with a 2–0 victory at home to Huddersfield on 10 December. City then lost just three of their next 16 games, and this fine run of form was capped with a 6–0 win over Gillingham, in which defender [[Louis Carey]] scored a brace. This was City's most emphatic league win since beating Charlton by the same score in September 1969, and was an encouraging sign of things to come, although they didn't quite make playoffs in 2006.

Despite a slow start to the [[2006-07 in English football|following season]], which saw a vocal minority of fans calling for Johnson to be sacked after a 4–2 home defeat by [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]] (who were eventually also promoted), City were in the top six of [[Football League One|League One]] by November and at the end of the month began an 11-match unbeaten run which drove them to the top of the division. They also hit the headlines with an impressive [[FA Cup]] run, being knocked out in the 4th round on penalties after a replay in which they held Premiership side [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] to a 2–2 draw in both ties. They knocked out [[Football League Championship|Championship]] side [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]] in the 3rd round. They also reached the Southern Area Final of the Football League Trophy, but were knocked out over two legs by local rivals Bristol Rovers after a 0–0 draw at Ashton Gate and a Rickie Lambert goal condemned the Robins to a 1–0 aggregate defeat in the second leg. Promotion to the [[Football League Championship|Championship]] was confirmed on the final day of the season with a 3–1 win over doomed [[Rotherham United F.C.|Rotherham United]]. [[David Noble (footballer)|David Noble]] scored two goals and [[Alex Russell]] scored once, securing runners-up place in the division and resulting in automatic promotion and joyous scenes of celebration in the city and even more so on the pitch at the full time whistle. [[2007-08 in English football|2007–08]] is the first season in almost a decade that has seen Bristol City playing at this level of English football.

===The Championship challenge (2007&amp;ndash;08 – 2008&amp;ndash;09)===
In the summer between City's promotion and the start of the Championship season, Gary Johnson made a number of signings. However their pre-season form didn't start well, losing 4–2 to [[Forest Green Rovers F.C.|Forest Green Rovers]]. However City got off to a good start going unbeaten for a number of matches and briefly topping the Championship after beating Coventry City 3–0. City then suffered a slight blip after losing 3–0 to [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]] before beating a variety of big name teams including [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] live on [[Sky Sports]] and [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]]. In November, City's form dipped and they endured a run of 4 games without a win, including a 6–0 thrashing at the hands of [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]]. In December, City's form picked up again and went unbeaten all the way to [[Boxing Day]] when they lost to [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] 4–1.

After a stop start run of form including victories over Blackpool and Coventry City and losses to [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] and Crystal Palace, City went top of the Championship on 1 March, after a 2–1 home victory over [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]]. After some indifferent results City went back to the top after a last gasp winner from [[Steve Brooker]], who was just returning from injury, in a 2–1 win over Norwich City. However a poor run ended City's chances of an automatic [[Promotion and relegation|promotion]] place. On 4 May 2008, a 3–0 home win against [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] on the final day of the league season ensured a play-off place and a semi-final fixture against Crystal Palace. On 13 May 2008, a 4–2 aggregate win over Crystal Palace with goals from [[Lee Trundle]] and [[Michael McIndoe]] confirmed City's trip to [[Wembley Stadium|Wembley]], where they were beaten 1–0 by Hull City.

After a poor start in the first half of the [[2008–09 in English football|2008–09]] season, City recovered after Christmas. After winning 4–2 away at [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] on Boxing Day, they took 13 points from five games in early 2009 to reach 8th place in the league by early February. City had a memorable away victory against [[Reading F.C.|Reading]] which saw them jump up to their highest position of the season to 4th. After a lot of draws, the season eventually petered out and City finished the season in 10th place.

===End of the Johnson era (2009-10)===
The [[2009–10 in English football|2009–10 season]] saw some good results in the Autumn, but heavy defeats to [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] (0–6) and [[Doncaster Rovers F.C.|Doncaster Rovers]] (2–5) in early 2010 lead to much dissatisfaction amongst fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Assistant manager [[Keith Millen]] took charge as caretaker manager, starting well with a draw against title favourites Newcastle United and a 5–3 win against Barnsley. After that, City beat [[Peterborough United F.C.|Peterborough United]] 1–0, which was the first time they had gone three matches unbeaten in the league since the end of October.

===Steve Coppell enigma (2010)===
In a brief press conference on 22 April 2010, it was announced that former Reading manager [[Steve Coppell]] would become the new City manager at the end of the [[2009–10 in English football|2009–10]] campaign, when he would start a 12-month rolling contract, and that Keith Millen, who had guided the club to Championship safety in his brief spell as caretaker manager, would remain at the club as his assistant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bcfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10327~2031194,00.html|title=Coppell New City Boss|publisher=Bristol City FC|accessdate=2010-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coppell's first game in charge was a 1–1 friendly draw with Swedish side [[IFK Gothenburg]]. His first win as manager was an 11–1 win against Swedish fourth division side Vallens IF on the same pre-season tour.

It was announced on 12 August 2010 that Coppell had resigned as manager with immediate effect. This followed his only two competitive games at the club, a 0–3 home defeat by [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] in the opening game of the 2010–11 [[Football League Championship]] and a 2–3 loss at [[Football League Two|League Two]] [[Southend United F.C.|Southend United]] in the [[Football League Cup]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC-Coppel-Resign&quot;&gt;{{Cite news
