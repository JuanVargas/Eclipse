elhurst Park]]. This move was unpopular with supporters and in the late 1980s significant steps were taken to bring about the club's return to The Valley. A [[Single-issue politics|single issue]] political party, the Valley Party, contested the 1990 local elections in [[London Borough of Greenwich|Greenwich Borough Council]] on a ticket of reopening the stadium, capturing 11% of the vote,&lt;ref name = &quot;Details about Charlton Athletic&quot;/&gt; aiding the club's return. The Valley Gold investment scheme was created to help supporters fund the return to The Valley, and several players were also sold to raise funds. For the 1991–92 season (and part of the 1992–93 season), the Addicks played at [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham]]'s [[The Boleyn Ground|Upton Park]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Details about Charlton Athletic&quot;&gt;{{cite news

Since the return to The Valley, three sides of the ground have been completely redeveloped turning The Valley into a modern, all-seater stadium with a 27,111 capacity. There are plans in place to increase the ground's capacity to approximately 31,000 and even around 40,000 in the future.&lt;ref name=&quot;Expansion plans underway&quot;&gt;{{cite news

===The Covered End===
The Valley's North Stand which is known by locals as &quot;The Covered End&quot; to this day and is where the more vocal fans gather. The Covered end title is quite self explanatory. It comes from the original design of the north stand before it was redeveloped.
The Valley Club (CAFC Supporters Club) was situated in Harvey Gardens behind the North Stand, and was managed by licensee [[Ray Donn]] from 1970 - 1984 the club had a full club licence supplying food and drink to its members and guests during match days and live entertainment, with cabaret and dancing every night of the week.
The Valley Club was one of the most popular club venues in South London at this time, featuring named entertainers popular today.

==Supporters==
The bulk of the club's support base comes from the [[London Borough]]s of [[London Borough of Lewisham|Lewisham]], [[London Borough of Greenwich|Greenwich]], [[London Borough of Bexley|Bexley]] and [[London Borough of Bromley|Bromley]] and also north-west Kent.  Charlton were rare among football clubs, in that they reserved a seat on their directors' board for a supporter. Any season ticket holder could put themselves forward for election, with a certain number of nominations, and votes were cast by all season ticket holders over the age of 18. The last such director, Ben Hayes,&lt;ref name=&quot;Supporters' Director&quot;&gt;{{cite news
| title = Supporters' Director
| url = http://www.cafc.co.uk/supporters_director.ink

which met for the first time in December 2008.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cafc.co.uk/supporters_director.ink&lt;/ref&gt;

Charlton's most common nickname is The Addicks. Among the theories on the origin of the Addicks name are that it was the south-east London pronunciation of either &quot;addict&quot; or &quot;athletic&quot;. However, the most likely origin of name is from a local fishmonger, Arthur &quot;Ikey&quot; Bryan, who rewarded the team with meals of haddock and chips.&lt;ref&gt;Clayton 2001, p.10&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Darren Bent Charlton Athletic v. Wigan Athletic.png|thumb|200px|left|Bent scoring an 86th-minute penalty against [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]], which earned Charlton a 1–0 victory]]
The progression of the nickname can be seen in the book ''The Addicks Cartoons: An Affectionate Look into the Early History of Charlton Athletic'', which covers the pre-First World War history of Charlton through a narrative based on 56 cartoons which appeared in the now defunct Kentish Independent. The very first cartoon, from 31 October 1908, calls the team the Haddocks. By 1910, the name had changed to Addicks although it also appeared as Haddick.
The club has had two other nicknames, the Robins, adopted in 1931, and the Valiants, chosen in a fan competition in the 1960s which also led to the adoption of the sword badge which is still in use. The Addicks nickname never went away and was revived by fans after the club lost its Valley home in 1985 and went into exile at [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]]. It is now once again the official nickname of the club.

===Valley Floyd Road===
The fans' favourite chant is entitled [http://www.cafc.co.uk/CharltonSongs.ink &quot;Valley, Floyd Road&quot;] (Floyd Road being the address of the stadium) and is sung to the tune of [[Paul McCartney]]'s &quot;Mull of Kintyre&quot;. The team run out to [http://www.cafc.co.uk/CharltonSongs.ink &quot;The Red, Red Robin&quot;] and the version played is one by the [[Billy Cotton]] band first recorded in the 1950s. A number of versions have been recorded, however this version is now well established.

==In popular culture==
Charlton Athletic featured in the [[ITV]] one-off drama, 'Albert's Memorial', screened on Sunday 12 September 2010, and starring [[Sir David Jason]] and [[David Warner (actor)|David Warner]]. David Jason's character, Harry, is revealed to be a Charlton Athletic fan. Harry later buries his friend, Albert, played by [[Michael Jayston]], draped in a Charlton Athletic flag, to which Frank says, &quot;hear that?&quot;. Harry replies,&quot;no...what?&quot; Frank says, &quot;that's the sound of Albert turning in his grave. He hated Charlton Athletic&quot;, so Harry replies, &quot;well, nobody's perfect.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itv.com/dramapremieres/albertsmemorial/] Albert's Memorial: ITV&lt;/ref&gt;

==Colours and crest==

[[Image:Greenwich arms.png|thumb|100px|Crest of the former [[Metropolitan Borough of Greenwich]] Council, used by Charlton briefly in late 1940s and early 50s]]Charlton have used a number of crests and badges during their history, although the current design has not been changed since 1968. The first known badge, from the 1930s, consisted of the letters CAF in the shape of a [[clubs (suit)|club]] from a pack of cards. In the 1940s, Charlton used a design featuring a [[European Robin|robin]] sitting in a football within a shield, sometimes with the letters CAFC in the four quarters of the shield, which was worn for the 1946 FA Cup final. In the late 1940s and early 1950s, the crest of the former metropolitan borough of Greenwich was used as a symbol for the club but this was not used on the team's shirts.&lt;ref name = &quot;Charlton Athletic F.C. Crest History&quot;/&gt;

In 1963, a competition was held to find a new badge for the club, and the winning entry was a hand holding a sword, which complied with Charlton's nickname of the time, the Valiants.&lt;ref name = &quot;Charlton Athletic F.C. Crest History&quot;/&gt; Over the next five years modifications were made to this design, such as the addition of a circle surrounding the hand and sword and including the club's name in the badge. By 1968, the design had reached the one known today, and has been used continuously from this year, apart from a period in the 1970s when the just the letters CAFC appeared on the team's shirts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Charlton Athletic F.C. Crest History&quot;&gt;{{cite news

With the exception of one season, Charlton have always played in red and white. The colours had been chosen by the group of boys who had founded Charlton Athletic in 1905 after having to play their first matches in the borrowed kits of their local rivals Woolwich Arsenal, who also played in red and white.&lt;ref&gt;Clayton 2001, p.8&lt;/ref&gt;  The exception came during the 1923–24 season when Charlton wore the colours of Catford Southend as part of the proposed move to Catford, which were light and dark blue stripes.&lt;ref&gt;Clayton 2001, p.32&lt;/ref&gt;  However, after the move fell through, Charlton returned to wearing red and white as their home colours.

[[Image:Charlton20618news1.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Charlton's top appearance maker, [[Sam Bartram]]]] 

Goalkeeper [[Sam Bartram]] is Charlton's record appearance maker, having played a total of 623 times between 1934 and 1956. But for six years lost to the Second World War, when no league football was played, this tally would be far higher.&lt;ref&gt;Clayton 2001, p.104&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Keith Peacock]] is the club's second highest appearance maker with 591 games between 1961 and 1979.&lt;ref name=&quot;Page 320&quot;&gt;Clayton 2001, p.320&lt;/ref&gt;

Charlton's record goalscorer is [[Derek Hales]], who scored 168 times in all competitions in 368 matches, during two spells, for the club.&lt;ref name=&quot;Page 320&quot;/&gt; 

Counting only league goals, [[Stuart Leary]] is the club's record scorer with 153 goals between 1951 and 1962.&lt;ref&gt;Clayton 2001, p.112&lt;/ref&gt; 

The record number of goals scored in one season is 33, scored by [[Ralph Allen (footballer)|Ralph Allen]] in the [[1934-35 in English football|1934–35]] season.&lt;ref&gt;Clayton 2001, p.58&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cross-country skiing''' (commonly abbreviated '''XC skiing''') is a [[winter sport]] in which participants propel themselves across snow-covered terrain using [[ski]]s and [[Ski pole|poles]]. It is popular in many places with large snowfields, primarily [[Northern Europe]], [[Canada]], and [[Alaska]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Rees3-9&quot;&gt;Rees, 1981, pages 3-9&lt;/ref&gt; 

Cross-country skiing is part of the [[Nordic skiing]] sport family, which also includes [[ski jumping]], and a combination sport of cross-country skiing and ski jumping called [[Nordic combined]]. Free-technique cross-country skiing is also the method of [[Motion (physics)|locomotion]] in the combination sport of [[Biathlon]], which adds [[marksmanship|rifle marksmanship]] to skiing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rees3-9&quot; /&gt; Another combination sport is [[ski-orienteering]], which adds the skill of map navigation along snow trails and tracks.

Related sports are [[backcountry skiing]] and [[Telemark skiing]]. The [[ski touring]] article provides an overview of different ski styles and techniques.

== Recreational skiing ==
[[Image:Cross-country skiing Schwedentritt.jpg|thumb|Cross-country skiing (skating style) in [[Einsiedeln, Switzerland]].]]

Recreational cross-country skiing is most frequently known as touring. Some skiers stay out for extended periods using [[tent]]s and equipment similar to bushwalkers/hikers, whereas others take relatively short trips from ski resorts on maintained trails. In some countries, organizations maintain a network of huts for use by cross-country skiers in wintertime. For example, the [[Norwegian Mountain Touring Association]] maintains over 400 huts stretching across hundreds of kilometres of trails which are used by hikers in the summer and by skiers in the winter.

==Competition==
As a [[sport]], cross-country skiing is one of the most difficult endurance sports, as its motions use every major [[muscle]] group and it (along with running, rowing and swimming) is one of the sports that burn the most calories per hour in execution. One of the legends in cross-country skiing competitions is [[Bjørn Dæhlie]] (Norway). In a test performed by his physiologist, Erlend Hem, Dæhlie made a [[VO2 max|VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-max]] of 96 ml/kg/min of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, a world record.&lt;ref name=&quot;daehlie&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.traininglog.dk/daehlie.html|title = Bjoern Daehlie (born June 19, 1967) |accessdate = 2009-09-13|last = www.traininglog.dk/XC |authorlink = |year = 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern cross-country ski competition is experiencing a revolution that is resulting in greater compatibility with audiences which began with the addition of the Sprint event to the [[Cross-country skiing World Cup medalists|World Cup]] and [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] competitions in 2002. Today more and more races are being held in audience-friendly formats, such as mass start, sprint, relay and pursuit (a race that involves switching skis, and styles halfway through the race). The modern events in which athletes compete in at the World Cup and Olympics are (distances presented in Female/Male format): 1&amp;nbsp;km Sprint, 2X1 km Team Sprint, 10&amp;nbsp;km/15&amp;nbsp;km Individual Start, 15&amp;nbsp;km/30&amp;nbsp;km Pursuit, 30&amp;nbsp;km/50&amp;nbsp;km Mass Start, and 4x5 km/4x10 km Relay.

[[Image:Campeonato mundial.jpg|thumb|[[Cesar Baena]] competes Cross-country skiing (classic style) in [[Liberec, Czech Republic]] during World Ski Championships 2009.]]

Today, there are several types of cross-country competitive events, involving [[racing|races]] of various types and lengths, as well as [[biathlon]], involving a combination of cross-country skiing and target shooting with a [[rifle]].

The [[Winter Olympics]], the [[FIS Nordic World Ski Championships]], and the FIS World Cup events (including the [[Holmenkollen ski jump|Holmenkollen]]) have long been a showcase for the world's fastest cross country skiers. There are also special distance ski races, sometimes called [[Worldloppet Ski Federation|ski marathons]], like ''[[Vasaloppet]]'' in [[Sweden]], ''[[Birkebeinerrennet|Birkebeineren]]'' in Norway, the [[Canadian Birkebeiner]]&lt;ref name=&quot;CanadianBirkie&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.canadianbirkie.com/about.php|title = The Birkebeiner Legend|accessdate = 2008-02-27|last = Canadian Birkebeiner Society|authorlink = |year = 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080206132000/http://www.canadianbirkie.com/about.php &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[American Birkebeiner]] the Tour of Anchorage in [[Anchorage]], [[Alaska]] and the [[Tug Hill Tourathon]] in the US. The skiing styles in these races might be fixed, or, in case of the so-called &quot;double pursuit&quot; event, the two styles are used each in their own separate half of the race (with a change of equipment in &quot;pit stops&quot; half way through).

The [[Canadian Ski Marathon]], despite its name, is not a race, but a tour, the world's longest, at 160&amp;nbsp;km. The skiers choose their distance challenge and try to accomplish it. The highest honour, the Coureur de Bois Gold, is given to those who ski the entire distance and camp out overnight, bringing all their food and gear with them in a big backpack.

Since 2005, one of the world's longest cross country skiing races has been held in [[Forestville, Quebec]], [[Canada]]. The [[Boreal Loppet]] has a race loop of 100&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref name=&quot;Forestville&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.boreal100kloppet.ca/main.php?lang=en|title = Boreal Loppet|accessdate = 2008-02-27|last = Boreal Loppet|authorlink = |year = 2008|month = February |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080123082859/http://www.boreal100kloppet.ca/main.php?lang=en &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[Image:Skigudinne.jpg|A skiing [[Sami people|Sami]] woman or a goddess. [[Olaus Magnus]].|thumb]] Cross-country skiing originated in [[Fennoscandia]]n countries in [[prehistory|prehistoric]] times. It was still widely practiced in the 19th century as a way of moving from place to place in winter. Elk, deer and other animals were hunted by skiing. Nowadays almost everyone in countries with strong cross-country skiing traditions — like [[Norway]], [[Sweden]], [[Finland]], [[Estonia]] and [[Latvia]] — has used or regularly uses skis.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rees3-9&quot; /&gt;

By contrast skiing is relatively new in [[North America]] and was introduced by [[Norway|Norwegian]] and [[Sweden|Swedish]] immigrants in the 1850s. [[Snowshoe Thompson]] is widely credited for introducing the sport to California in the USA. In Canada pioneers included [[Aldolf Olsen]], [[Sigurd Lockeberg|Sigurd]] and [[Hans Lockeberg]] and [[Jackrabbit Johannsen]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Rees3-9&quot; /&gt; 

In Canada, although Johannsen never claimed to be the first skier in Canada, he had a major role in stimulating an interest in the sport. He organized races, officiated events, and served as a guide, coach, and consultant for numerous skiing organizations, many of which he helped to found. An enthusiastic teacher, he helped coach Canada's Olympic team in 1932. At the age of 55, he shocked his Canadian Olympic pupils as he accompanied the team step by step through its rigorous training schedule—and still he had energy to spare. This was, however, still quite far from being the twilight of Jackrabbit's incredible skiing career, as he didn't ski his last official race until the age of 75, and still glided through the snowy woods on a daily basis well past the age of 100.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rees3-9&quot; /&gt;

This form of skiing has been used by [[explorer]]s as a means of [[transport]], and all Nordic armies have ski-trained infantry for [[winter]] operations. Skis gave important mobility to the Finnish army during the [[Winter War]] and allowed the small groups of Finns to beat large armies of Russians. Similar tactics that utilize skis have been used in many times by the Finns and Karelians in the past. Pre-modern skiing troops were armed with [[crossbow]]s and [[ski pole]]s which had a [[spear]]head on the other end.

Traditionally, all of the equipment was made of natural materials: [[wood]]en skis and [[bamboo]] poles with [[leather]] hand straps.&lt;ref name=&quot;CCCski Overview&quot;&gt;[http://www.cccski.com/dbfiles/139.pdf CrossCountryCanada Overview]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Footwear]] was usually sturdy leather [[boot]]s with thick soles. Bindings evolved from simple straps made of twisted wood-based thread, to the so-called [[Kandahar binding]] with the fastening of both the boot’s front and back, to the ‘Rat Trap’ front-only binding, which is today known as the ''Nordic norm'', and has evolved in various modern bindings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rees11-45&quot;&gt;Rees, 1981, pages 11-45&lt;/ref&gt;

== Equipment ==
Equipment differs according to skiing technique.

=== Skis ===
{{Main|Ski}}
The [[ski]]s are long and narrow, to distribute the [[weight]] of the skier and allow the skier to move quickly. Typical ski dimensions are 2 metres in length, about 5 centimetres in width and one to four centimetres in thickness at different stations along the length of the ski. Depending on the ski design and purpose, they are fitted to the skier based on height and weight.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rees11-45&quot; /&gt; The toe of the skier's [[ski boots|footwear]] is attached to the ski with a [[Ski binding|binding]], while the heel remains free.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rees11-45&quot; /&gt; 

Characteristics of cross-country skis:
* Width – Generally, a skating ski is shorter&lt;ref name=&quot;MEC Nordic Ski&quot; /&gt; and narrower&lt;ref name=&quot;CCCski Overview&quot; /&gt; than a classic ski. A ski intended for off-track use is wider and heavier.&lt;ref name=&quot;XCSkiworld Classic&quot; /&gt; Cross-country skis are sometimes informally known as &quot;skinny skis&quot; because of their narrowness compared to alpine skis.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rees11-45&quot; /&gt;
* Tip – To help cut through deep snow, the tip of a cross-country ski is typically higher and more curved than an alpine ski.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}
* Camber – for [[Cross-country skiing#Classic|classic technique]], [[camber]], the amount of vertical curvature in the ski, is crucial to create a ''kick zone''.&lt;ref name = &quot;MEC Nordic Ski&quot;&gt;[http://www.mec.ca/Main/content_text.jsp?FOLDER%3C%3Efolder_id=2534374302881832&amp;CONTENT%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198674018167&amp;bmUID=1262643770948 MEC website Cross-country skis]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;XCSkiworld Classic&quot;&gt;[http://www.xcskiworld.com/equip/equip_classic.htm XCSkiworld Classic Equipment]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Bottom surface – Many skis have smooth bottoms which require [[Cross-country skiing#Waxes|waxing]], but [[Cross-country skiing#Waxless skis|waxless skis]] are available.&lt;ref name=&quot;CCCski Overview&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MEC Nordic Ski&quot; /&gt;
* Edges – For track skiing, skis usually do not have metal edges; Backcountry and [[Telemark skiing|Telemark]] skis however often have edges.&lt;ref name=&quot;CCCski Overview&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MEC Nordic Ski&quot; /&gt;
* [[Sidecut]] – indicates the shape or profile of the ski. Sidecut affects the way a ski tracks (travels in a straight line) and turns. Skis with limited sidecut and a straighter profile (Classic skis) track or glide forward easily. A ski with lots of sidecut will turn more easily but not track as smoothly. Skating skis usually have minimal sidecut: the tips and tails are only slightly wider than the waist. This increases stability in the glide phase.&lt;ref name=&quot;MEC Nordic Ski&quot; /&gt;
* Materials – Formerly, many skis were made of wood alone, or with a fiberglass or synthetic coating over the inner wood layer. Modern skis have synthetic foam cores.&lt;ref name=&quot;CCCski Overview&quot; /&gt;

=== Poles ===
{{Main|Ski pole}}

Like [[alpine skiing]], cross-country skiers carry two [[Ski pole|poles]] for steadiness and propulsion. Early ski poles were usually made from [[bamboo]], but this was supassed in the 1960s by [[aluminium]] or [[Glass-reinforced plastic|fiberglass]] construction. More expensive poles are made of [[Graphite reinforced plastic|graphite or carbon fiber]] or some other strong but lightweight material.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rees11-45&quot; /&gt;

Poles have a spike at the end to provide a fixed pivot when the pole penetrates through to a hard surface, and a plastic web or disc (called the ''basket''), to provide extra purchase in snow and to ensure the pole doesn't sink too deeply. Different basket styles are available for different techniques and snow conditions.&lt;ref name=&quot;CCCski Overview&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MEC Boots&quot;&gt;[http://www.mec.ca/Main/content_text.jsp?CONTENT%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198674018171&amp;FOLDER%3C%3Efolder_id=2534374302881830&amp;bmUID=1262642455491 MEC website Nordic Ski Boots, Bindings, &amp; Poles]&lt;/ref&gt;

Nordic poles are longer than poles for alpine skiing. Skating or freestyle poles are usually longer than those used for the classic technique. Poles should be sized proportionally to the height of the skier. The wrist strap helps prevent the skier from dropping the pole, and also assists with pushing in all poling techniques.&lt;ref name=&quot;MEC Boots&quot; /&gt;

===Bindings===
{{Main|Ski_binding#Cross_country}}
[[Image:SNS Boot n Binding.jpg|right|thumb|SNS Profil boot (Salomon) and ski binding (Fisher)]]
The binding holds or clips the toe of the boot to the ski. Most bindings are mounted on the skis by screws.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rees11-45&quot; /&gt;

Depending on technique, boots are generally much lighter in construction than alpine boots. Boots for track skiing are lower cut, with less ankle support, resembling a running shoe. Skating boots are usually higher, stiffer, and reinforced around the heel and ankle. The increased stiffness is designed to support the lateral push-off of the skating stride. Backcountry boots are heavier, with more ankle support.&lt;ref name=&quot;MEC Boots&quot; /&gt;

Older styled ''three-pin bindings (Nordic Norm)'', with or without cables, are still used by backcountry and Telemarking enthusiasts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rees11-45&quot; /&gt; The sole of the boot is extended forward slightly at the toe. There are three holes in the bottom of the toe which mate with the pins in the binding. With this system the sole of the boot flexes as the skier strides.

There are three primary groups of [[ski binding#Cross country|binding systems]] used in modern cross-country skiing:
* NNN (New Nordic Norm) – including R1-R3 and the new R4-R5 NIS (Nordic Integrated System) variants
* SNS (Salomon Nordic System) Profil
* SNS Pilot

=== Waxes ===
{{Main|Ski wax}}
There are a wide variety of waxes for Nordic Skiing. The waxes can be classified into four main categories: ''glide waxes'', ''kick waxes'', ''klisters'' and ''waxtapes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rees81-09&quot;&gt;Rees, 1981, pages 81-99&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Glide wax ====
Glide waxes are used to make a ski glide faster, and are applied by ironing onto the ski. Glide waxes range widely in price, depending on quality; racing waxes can be very expensive, over $100 for a 60&amp;nbsp;gram block of wax. They are generally in the form of blocks, though they can be found as powders or liquids. Glide waxes are applied outside the kick zone of classic skis, or to the full length of skate skis.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rees81-09&quot; /&gt; They are the only type of wax used on skating skis.&lt;ref name=&quot;CCCski Overview&quot; /&gt;

==== Kick wax ====
The purpose of kick wax is to provide grip on snow when weight is transferred on a ski; they are used on classic skis only. Kick waxes are applied in the ''kick zone'' of classic skis if the ski is not a fish-scale, waxless ski.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rees81-09&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skiwax.ca/index_tp.php SkiWax.ca]&lt;/ref&gt;

Kick waxes are classified according to their hardness: harder waxes are for colder and newer snow. Using a wax that is too hard will not give sufficient grip, while wax that is too soft will cause the formation of an [[ice]] sole that slows the skier down. It is not uncommon to apply a new layer of wax if the weather changes, or when moving in altitude.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rees81-09&quot; /&gt;

The difficulty of choosing correct kick waxes to different conditions is nowadays greatly reduced by grip wax tapes, which have a wide temperature range, and are easily applied to the ski bottom. Although these are not used by competitors, who prefer the optimum waxing, they have proven to be quite suitable for fitness and recreational purposes. Many high-level competitive teams have &quot;wax technicians&quot; whose job is to apply the ideal wax combinations for the conditions.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} 

Kick waxes generate grip by penetrating into the snowflakes when the skier puts his weight on the ski. Colder snowflakes are harder, and so is newly fallen snow. The most appropriate wax is the one that is soft enough to generate grip, but also hard enough not to accumulate snow and create a sole.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rees81-09&quot; /&gt;

Waxes are usually colour-coded by usage temperature: the most common are red for above 0˚C, and blue for below. There are many other colours for more specific temperature ranges, for instance violet for around 0˚C, green for below -10˚C, and white for below -15˚C. The snow-temperature range given by the producer must be taken with a grain of salt, since new snow will require a harder wax.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rees81-09&quot; /&gt;

Guessing the right hardness can be quite difficult, and the varying condition of the snow can make the right choice wrong after a few hundred metres. Furthermore, the snow in the beaten track is usually much different from the one immediately surrounding it, and works best with a softer wax. If skis are poorly tuned, sometimes the skier can solve thin snow soles caused by a soft wax by beating the ski on the track after kicking; the opposite problem may be handled by skating. One way around the problems of standard grip wax is to use a wax grip tape, which is applied to the kick zone of the ski in tape form. The tape can last for {{convert|100|to|200|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} has a very wide temp range (-20C to +5C), and can be left on the ski at the end of the day and stored by covering in waxed paper.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rees81-09&quot; /&gt;

==== Klister ====
If the temperature is above zero in Celsius scale, kick wax cannot provide any more grip. One must therefore resort to ''klister'', which is basically a glue-like paste (in Scandinavian languages &quot;klister&quot; actually means &quot;paste&quot;, &quot;glue&quot; or &quot;size&quot; used in papering). Klister is discouraging for amateurs, as it is very sticky, it is easy to apply but very difficult to remove.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rees81-09&quot; /&gt;

Klister can be applied with a plastic blade or with the palm of the hand. The hand is then cleaned in the glove, rubbing against the glove fabric while sweating. Since klister is a non-polar substance, a non-polar [[solvent]] (such as [[mineral spirits]]) or a [[soap]] is necessary to remove it. It is possible to buy solvents made specifically for cleaning skis. These should be used with care, as they are both [[flame|flammable]] and [[toxicity|toxic]] if inhaled or absorbed through the skin.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rees81-09&quot; /&gt;

Klister is also colour-coded: red, purple, blue and silver.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rees81-09&quot; /&gt;

=== Waxless skis ===
In recent decades waxless skis have become popular in the recreational ski market. Introduced in 1970, waxless skis accounted for 75 percent of cross country sales in the United States in 1985, despite their typically poor performance compared with well-waxed skis.&lt;ref name=&quot;waxless&quot;&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=698DAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA12&amp;lpg=PA12&amp;dq=%22waxless+ski%22+marketing&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=o_0A-FQOBl&amp;sig=9Y8DmKx6_Ojze4XMmTvXupuhQkA&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=9IzlS5u_IYqyNorz8YYI&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22waxless%20ski%22%20marketing&amp;f=false Inventing a ski that you didn't have to wax was easy. Listening to everybody laugh was the hard part]&lt;/ref&gt;

Waxless skis have a [[fish]] [[scale (zoology)|scale]], cross-hatched or ridged pattern in the kick zone to provide grip. A waxless ski is inferior to a finely tuned waxed ski, but does not require the sometimes time-consuming and sometimes costly selection and application of kick wax or klister and will work between temperatures, an important advantage in areas with many sun/shadow boundaries. Some skiers apply a layer of glide wax to keep them sliding smoothly and protecting the surface from dirt and ice build-up. There are specialty liquid wax products on the market manufactured for waxless skis, though standard glide wax can also be used on the tips and tails of the ski.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rees11-45&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bergin&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.snocountry.com/article.php/20041227133240622 |title = Back to Basics: A Quick Look at Paste Waxes, Waxless Ski Preparation and Kick Waxing|accessdate = 2009-01-25|last = Bergin|first = Ron |authorlink = |year = 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070402051820/http://www.snocountry.com/article.php/20041227133240622 |archivedate = 2007-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;XCSkiWorld&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.xcskiworld.com/equip/equip_classic.htm|title = Equipment - For Classic|accessdate = 9 May 2010|last = XC Ski World|authorlink = |year = undated}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Waxless skis are better suited to recreational and casual skiers who want to ski with minimal time spent on maintenance, as they generally produce too much drag for competitive skiers and those who value comparatively effortless movement.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rees11-45&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MECwaxless&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.mec.ca/Main/content_text.jsp?FOLDER%3C%3Efolder_id=2534374302887206&amp;CONTENT%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198674018167&amp;bmUID=1273406691921|title = Cross-Country Skis (Nordic Skis)|accessdate = 9 May 2010|last = [[Mountain Equipment Coop]]|authorlink = |year = 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Waxless skis are sometimes used by Nordic racers during variable ski conditions such as temperatures over freezing. At the [[1976 Winter Olympics]] held in [[Innsbruck]], US ski team member [[Bill Koch (skier)|Bill Koch]] won a silver medal on waxless skis.&lt;ref name=&quot;waxless&quot; /&gt;

== Styles and techniques ==
There are three main styles used in cross-country skiing: classic, skating and telemarking. There is also skiathlon, which combines classic and skating. Specially adapted equipment is available to suit each. Another style growing in popularity is [[skijoring]]. In skijoring, the skier is pulled over the snow by one or more dogs, or, alternatively, a snowmobile. Both classic and skating techniques are used by skijorers.
[[Image:Umpihankihiihdon-mm.jpg|thumb|right|Opening a track through deep snow can be quite arduous.]]

=== Classic ===
The classic style is often used on prepared trails (pistes) that have pairs of parallel grooves (tracks) cut into the snow.

Skis have [[wikt:camber|camber]] and should leave the centre section of the ski clear of the snow when the skier's weight is evenly distributed between the pair. The centre section of a classic ski will either have &quot;fish scales&quot;, or [[ski wax]] that will stick to the snow (called the &quot;kick zone&quot; or &quot;grip zone&quot; of the ski). When full weight is transferred to a single ski the kick zone comes into contact with the snow.&lt;ref name=&quot;XCSkiworld Classic&quot; /&gt; Glide wax is used on the tails and tips of the skis.&lt;ref name=&quot;CCCski Overview&quot; /&gt;

The basic techniques of classic skiing are classified by flat terrain, uphill, downhill and turning. On the flat terrain the ''diagonal stride'' is most commonly used and is a running action with parallel skis, kicking and gliding with each stride. The poles are planted alternately on the opposite side to the kick. ''Three-step'' and ''four-step diagonals'' are also used. The three-step is also known as a ''change-up'' or ''passgang'' and involved three strides to one pole push. Another flat-terrain technique is ''double poling'', whereby the legs are not moved and all propulsive force is provided by the two poles used together. Double poling may be combined with strides in the one-step and two-step double pole techniques.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rees46-79&quot;&gt;Rees, 1981, pages 46-79.&lt;/ref&gt;

On uphill terrain classic techniques include the ''side step'' where the skis are used perpendicular to the slope, the ''herringbone'', where the skis are &quot;V&quot;ed outwards and a ''tight diagonal'', where the flat land diagonal technique is employed with much shorter glides.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rees46-79&quot; /&gt;

Downhill classic skiing involves using the ''snowplow'', whereby the skis are turned inwards with the tips nearly together to create drag and thus descent speed. Turning on flat terrain is often accomplished with a ''tip-turn'', moving the skis round the turn from a diagonal stride. Another turning technique is the ''kick-turn'', conducted by lifting the ski while double poling. The ''skate-turn'' transfers the weight onto the turning forward ski as in ice skating. Other methods of turning include the ''telemark-turn'', using the trailing ski as a rudder, ''skid-turn'' and ''stem christie alpine-turn'' done from a downhill snowplow.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rees46-79&quot; /&gt;

Skate skiing involves a decisive weight transfer onto one [[ski]] angled and then the other, supported by the inner edge of the ski on the snow, which looks similar to an [[ice skating|ice skater]]. As in classic skiing, transferring weight completely from one ski to the next is essential to learning to skate. Those who have learned to ice skate or rollerskiing may find ski skating technique easier to learn than classic skiing. The free technique in XC skiing is not to be confused with [[freestyle skiing|freestyle]], which describes ski sport where the competitors compete over a mogul course and by performing aerial gymnastics such as spins after launching from a short ramp in the snow.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

Skate skiing can be done either with skis specifically designed for skating or 'combi' skis for both skating and classic styles. Similarly, specialized skating boots or combi boots can be used. Skate skis tend to be shorter and stiffer than those used for the classical technique, and the poles are longer. Neither fish scale skis nor grip wax are used.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} 

Different limb-movement patterns are used for different terrain and speeds. There is no internationally accepted naming convention for these techniques.

There are also variants of these techniques, most notably hop-skating, which involves dynamic tempo causing both skis to leave the snow at the same time; generally it is used as a V-1 (offset skate) variant on short hills, but a few racers jump-skate in V-2 (1-skate) sprinting.

Skating style became popular during 1980s. The Finnish skier [[Pauli Siitonen]] used the style in 1970s (in Germany in the 1980s skating was called &quot;Siitonen-Schritt&quot; in reference to him). Siitonen had found the style useful at the middle of the race he already thought was lost. After switching to skating Siitonen managed to win the race, to his surprise. The success of [[Bill Koch (skier)|Bill Koch]] ([[United States|USA]]) in [[FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 1982|1982 Cross-country Skiing Championships]] held in [[Oslo]] drew more attention to the skating style. In the [[1984 Winter Olympics]] of Sarajevo many competitors used an immature form of skating kicking extra speed with one feet (trail being in the middle of trace matured technique was not appropriate). This trend was yet stronger at Seefield's World Championships in 1985. The International Ski Federation (FIS) was confused about these developments. At Seefeld there were some attempts to force competitors to use the traditional style by using plastic walls during the 30&amp;nbsp;km race. However, later that year the FIS decided to start organising separate races for traditional and skating styles. Separate traditional and free events were used already in [[FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 1987|World Championships held in Oberstdorf]] (1987).{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

Skating technique is only suitable for use on prepared trails (pistes), firm and smooth snow or snow crust and frozen snow-covered lakes or rivers.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} 

Skating is faster and different muscular exercise than classic skiing, except in extremely cold conditions where classic skiing may approach skating in speed. Adoption of the skating technique varies from country to country. In some countries the majority of non-professional racers now skate, although top skiers continue to learn and train in both styles.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

The distinction between classic technique and free technique is made in competition i.e., a race will be designated as classic or free. In the case of the former only those propulsion techniques that are considered 'classic' are allowed whereas in the latter the competitors are free to use any technique although the majority of competitors will opt to skate. Large races will often have both skate and classic divisions and award prizes in both categories.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

Recent developments in the sport include &quot;double pursuit&quot; races where the competitors complete the first part of the event using the classic technique and the second part using the free technique.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

[[File:Rio de janeiro copacabana beach 2010.JPG|thumb|250px|right|A view of the Copacabana beach from Sugar Loaf.]]
'''Copacabana''' ({{IPA-pt|kopakaˈbɐ̃nɐ}}) is a [[borough]] located in the southern zone of the city [[Rio de Janeiro]], known for its 4&amp;nbsp;km [[beach]] which is one of the most famous in the world.

The district was originally called ''Sacopenapã'' until the mid-18th century. It was renamed after the construction of a chapel holding a replica of the [[Virgen de Copacabana]], the [[patron saint]] of [[Bolivia]]. It was incorporated into the city on July 6, 1892.

Copacabana begins at Princesa Isabel Avenue and ends at Posto Seis ([[lifeguard]] watchtower Six). Beyond Copacabana, there are two small beaches, one inside [[Fort Copacabana]] and other, right after it: Diabo Beach. [[Arpoador]] beach, where surfers used to go after its perfect waves, comes in the sequence, followed by the famous borough of [[Ipanema]].

According to Riotur, the Tourism Secretariat of Rio de Janeiro, there are 63 hotels and 10 hostels in Copacabana.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rio.rj.gov.br/riotur/en/hotel/?Canal=184 Riotur]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Copacabana Beach==
[[Image:CopacabanaPavement.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The [[Portuguese pavement]] wave pattern at Copacabana beach.]]
[[File:Location map Rio de Janeiro Copacabana.png|thumb|left|300px|Map. Click three times to view clearly]]
Copacabana beach stretches from Posto Dois (lifeguard watchtower Two) to Posto Seis (lifeguard watchtower Six). [[Leme (Rio de Janeiro)|Leme]] is at Posto Um (lifeguard watchtower One). There are historic forts at both ends of Copacabana beach; ''Fort Copacabana'', built in 1914, is at the south end by Posto Seis and ''Fort Duque de Caxias'', built in 1779, at the north end. One curiosity is that the lifeguard watchtower of Posto Seis never existed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.funceb.org.br/espacocultural.html FUNCEB - Fundação Cultural Exército Brasileiro]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hotels, restaurants, bars, night clubs and residential buildings dot the [[promenade]].

Copacabana Beach plays host to millions of revellers during the annual [[New Year's Eve]] celebrations and, in most years, has been the official venue of the [[FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup]].

==Copacabana promenade==
The Copacabana promenade is a pavement landscape in large scale (4 kilometres long). It was completed in 1970 and has used a black and white [[Portugal|Portuguese]] pavement design since its origin in the 1930s: a geometric wave. The Copacabana promenade was designed by [[Roberto Burle Marx]].

==Living standard==
Copacabana has the 11th highest [[Human Development Index]] in Rio, the 2000 census put the [[Human Development Index|HDI]] of Copacabana at 0.902.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.copacabana.com/copafato.shtml Compilação de dados, informações e fatos sobre Copacabana - Copacabana.COM]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Copacabana Beach Rio de Janeiro at Dawn 2009-04.JPG|thumb|Copacabana at dusk]]

==The borough==
According to the [[IBGE]], 160,000 people live in Copacabana and 44,000 or 27.5% of them are 60 years old or older.&lt;ref&gt;spl.camara.rj.gov.br/spl/spl_docdown; jsessionid=D87126B13F258E820EA8A71A891194B3?id=8449&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://veja.abril.com.br/vejarj/070606/comportamento.html Veja Rio on-line]&lt;/ref&gt; Copacabana covers an area of 7.84&amp;nbsp;km²{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} which gives the borough a [[population density]] of 20,400 people per km².

Residential buildings eleven to thirteen stories high built right next to each other dominate the borough. Houses and two-story buildings are rare.

==Transportation==
More than 40 different bus routes serve Copacabana,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rioonibus.com/guia_de_itinerarios/consultas/consulta-todos-numeros.asp Rio Ônibus]&lt;/ref&gt; as do three subway [[Rio de Janeiro Metro|Metro]] stations: Cantagalo, Siqueira Campos and Cardeal Arcoverde, with a fourth one (General Osório Station) in nearby [[Ipanema]].

Three major arteries parallel to each other cut across the entire borough: Atlantic Avenue, which is a 6 lane 4&amp;nbsp;km avenue by the beachside, Nossa Senhora de Copacabana Avenue and Barata Ribeiro/Raul Pompéia Street both of which are 4 lanes and 3.5&amp;nbsp;km in length. Barata Ribeiro Street changes its name to Raúl Pompéia Street after the Sá Freire Alvim [[Tunnel]]. Twenty-four streets intersect all three major arteries, and seven other streets intersect some of the three, but not all.

==Notable events==
[[Image:Hotel copacabana palace.jpg|thumb|The Copacabana Palace hotel]]
On December 31, 1994, the New Year's Eve celebrations featured a [[Rod Stewart]] concert, which featured 3.5 million, making it the largest concert crowd ever.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

On March 21, 2005, [[Lenny Kravitz]] performed there in front of 300,000 people, on a Monday night. On February 18, 2006, a Saturday, [[The Rolling Stones]] surpassed that mark by far, attracting over 1.5 million people to the beach. 

On July 7, 2007, the beach hosted the [[Live Earth concert, Rio de Janeiro|Brazilian leg]] of the [[Live Earth (2007 concert)|Live Earth concerts]], which attracted 400,000 people. As the headliner, [[Lenny Kravitz]] got to play the venue a second time, with [[Jorge Benjor]], [[Macy Gray]], [[O Rappa]] and [[Pharrell]] as the main opening acts, on October 2, 2009, 100,000 people filled the beach for a huge beach party as the IOC announced Rio would be hosting the 2016 Olympics. 11 of the 15 [[FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup]]s have taken place here.

[[Elton John]] had 2 concerts cancelled at the famous beach.The first in 2006 (New Year Party) and the second in 2007 (Red Piano Free Concert)

The '''Cy Young Award''' is an honor given annually in [[baseball]] to the best [[pitcher]]s in [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB), one each for the [[American League]] (AL) and [[National League]] (NL). The award was first introduced in 1956 by [[Commissioner of Baseball (MLB)|Baseball Commissioner]] [[Ford Frick]] in honor of [[Baseball Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] pitcher [[Cy Young]], who died in 1955. The award was originally given to the single best pitcher in the major leagues, but in 1967, after the retirement of Frick, the award was given to one pitcher in each league.&lt;ref name=&quot;BASEALM&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/awards/aw_cyy.shtml|title=Cy Young Award on Baseball Almanac|publisher=BaseballAlmanac.com|accessdate=2008-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MSN&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://encarta.msn.com/media_701500187/cy_young_award_winners_(american_league).html|title=Cy Young Award Winners (American League)|publisher=[[MSN]]|accessdate=2008-11-01|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5kwb8fdqL|archivedate=2009-10-31|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each league's award is voted on by members of the [[Baseball Writers Association of America]], with two representatives from each team, which means 28 ballots are cast for the American League winner, and 32 ballots are cast for the National League.&lt;ref name=&quot;BASEALM&quot; /&gt; Each voter places a vote for first, second, and third place among the pitchers of each league. The [[formula]] used to calculate the final scores is a weighted sum of the votes.{{ref label|Formula|A|A}} The pitcher with the highest score in each league wins the award.&lt;ref name=&quot;BASEALM&quot; /&gt; If two pitchers receive the same number of votes, the award is shared.&lt;ref name=&quot;BD&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0FCI/is_11_63/ai_n6332592|title=Cy Young Award voting results|publisher=Baseball Digest|accessdate=2008-11-01 | year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current formula started in the 1970 season. Before that, writers only voted for the best pitcher and used a formula of one point per vote.&lt;ref name=&quot;BASEALM&quot; /&gt;

==History==
[[Image:Young Cy 1 MLB HOF.jpg|right|thumb|[[Cy Young]], for whom the award is named]]
The Cy Young Award was first introduced in 1956 by [[Commissioner of Baseball]] [[Ford Frick]] in honor of [[Baseball Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] pitcher [[Cy Young]], who died in 1955.&lt;ref name=&quot;BASEALM&quot; /&gt; The award would be given to pitchers only. Originally given to the single best pitchers in the major leagues, the award changed its format over time. From 1956 to 1966, the award was given to one pitcher in Major League Baseball. After Frick retired in 1967, [[William Eckert]] became the new Commissioner of Baseball. Due to fan requests, Eckert announced that the Cy Young Award would be given out both in the [[American League]] and the [[National League]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BASEALM&quot; /&gt; From 1956 to 1958, a pitcher was not allowed to win the award on more than one occasion; this rule was eliminated in 1959. After a tie in the 1969 voting, the process was changed, in which each writer was to vote for three different pitchers: the first-place vote received five points, the second-place vote received three points, and the third-place vote received one point, a system that is still in use.&lt;ref name=&quot;BASEALM&quot; /&gt;

The first recipient of the Cy Young Award was [[Don Newcombe]] of the Dodgers, and the most recent winners are [[Roy Halladay]], from the National League, and [[Félix Hernández]], from the American League.&lt;ref name=&quot;BASEALM&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MLB&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/awards/mlb_awards_content.jsp?content=cy_history|title=Cy Young Award winners|publisher=[[Major League Baseball]]|accessdate=2008-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1957, [[Warren Spahn]] became the first left-handed pitcher to win the award. In 1963, [[Sandy Koufax]] became the first pitcher to win the award in a unanimous vote; two years later he became the first multiple winner. In 1974, [[Mike Marshall (pitcher)|Mike Marshall]] won the award, becoming the first [[relief pitcher]] to win the award.&lt;ref name=&quot;BASEALM&quot; /&gt; In 1978, [[Gaylord Perry]] (age 40) became the oldest pitcher to receive the award, only to have the record broken in 2004 by [[Roger Clemens]] (age 42).&lt;ref name=&quot;BASEALM&quot; /&gt; The youngest recipient was [[Dwight Gooden]] (age 20 in 1985).

===Multiple winners===
[[Image:RandyJohnson.jpg|right|thumb|[[Randy Johnson]], five-time winner]]
There have been 16&amp;nbsp;pitchers who have won the award multiple times. [[Roger Clemens]] currently holds the record for the most awards won, with seven. [[Greg Maddux]] (1992&amp;ndash;1995) and [[Randy Johnson]] (1999&amp;ndash;2002) share the record for the most consecutive awards won. Clemens, Johnson, [[Pedro Martínez]], [[Gaylord Perry]], and [[Roy Halladay]] are the only pitchers to have won the award in both the American League and National League; [[Sandy Koufax]] is the only pitcher who won multiple awards during the period when only one award was presented for all of Major League Baseball. [[Roger Clemens]] was the youngest pitcher to win a second Cy Young Award, while [[Tim Lincecum]] is the youngest pitcher to do so in the National League. [[Dennis Eckersley]] remains the last Cy Young Award winner to have won the MVP, doing so in 1992. Besides this, only five pitchers have won the award unanimously: [[Johan Santana]] (twice, in 2004 and 2006), Martínez (2000), Johnson (2002), [[Jake Peavy]] (2007) and Halladay (2010).

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Antisemitism}}
Anti-Judaic attitudes developed from the early years of Christianity and persisted over the ensuing centuries, driven by numerous factors including theological differences, competition between Church and Synagogue, the Christian drive for converts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Nancy Calvert Koyzis |title=Paul, monotheism and the people of God : the significance of Abraham traditions for early Judaism and Christianity
|year=2004 |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |isbn=0567083780
|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=FsDxt4E_4UMC&amp;pg=PA119&amp;lpg=PA119&amp;dq=judaism+proselytization&amp;source=web&amp;ots=IjCpeLvLsV&amp;sig=_g4m9XwaZGIkGb8BNveqNnEHzBw }}&lt;/ref&gt; misunderstanding of Jewish beliefs and practices, and alleged Jewish hostility toward Christians.

These attitudes persisted in Christian preaching, art and popular teaching of contempt for Jews over the centuries. In many Christian countries, it led to civil and political discrimination against Jews, legal [[Disabilities (Jewish)|disabilities]], and in some instances to physical attacks on Jews which occasionally ended in emigration, expulsion, and even death.

From time to time, anti-Jewish sentiments within European society were exploited for internal political purposes and sometimes to extract a financial advantage from Jewish subjects. Such sentiments made the expansion of anti-Jewish measures politically acceptable.

[[Antisemitism]] has been described as primarily hatred against Jews as a race with its modern expression rooted in 19th century racial theories, whilst anti-Judaism is described as hostility to Jewish religion but in Western Christianity it effectively merged into antisemitism during the 12th century.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;''After the evil: Christianity and Judaism in the shadow of the Holocaust&quot;'', Richard Harries, p. 16, Oxford University Press, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;
Scholars have debated how Christian antisemitism may have played a role in the [[Nazi]] [[Third Reich]], [[World War II]] and the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]].

Throughout Christian history, many popes, bishops and some Christian princes stepped up to protect Jews. It was only in the mid-20th century that the Catholic Church and many Protestant denominations issued major statements repudiating anti-Judaic theology and began a process of constructive Christian-Jewish interaction{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}.

==Anti-Judaism==
{{Main|Anti-Judaism}}

Many Christians do not consider [[anti-Judaism]] to be [[antisemitism]]. They regard anti-Judaism as a disagreement of religiously sincere  people with the tenets of Judaism, while regarding antisemitism as an emotional bias or hatred not specifically targeting the religion of Judaism. Under this approach, anti-Judaism is not regarded as antisemitism as it only rejects the religious ideas of Judaism and does not involve actual hostility to the Jewish people.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

Others see anti-Judaism as the rejection of or opposition to beliefs and practices ''essentially because'' of their source in [[Judaism]] or because a belief or practice is associated with the Jewish people. (But see [[supersessionism]])

Although some Christians in the past did consider anti-Judaism to be contrary to Christian teaching, this view was not widely expressed by leaders and lay people. In many cases, the practical tolerance towards the Jewish religion and Jews prevailed. Some Christian groups, particularly in early years, condemned verbal anti-Judaism.

{{quotation|…Two reasons can be assigned for the fact that Our Lord’s faithful members will often be betrayed by those who should be on the side of Christ the King. Firstly, many Catholic writers speak of papal condemnations of Anti-Semitism without explaining the meaning of the term and never even allude to the documents which insist on the rights of Our Divine Lord, Head of the Mystical Body, Priest and King. Thus, very many are completely ignorant of the duty incumbent on all Catholics of standing positively for Our Lord’s reign in society in opposition to Jewish naturalism.

The result is that numbers of Catholics are so ignorant of Catholic doctrine that they hurl the accusation of Anti-Semitism against those who are battling for the rights of Christ the King thus effectively aiding the enemies of Our Divine Lord. Secondly, many Catholic writers copy unquestioningly what they read in the naturalistic or anti-supernatural Press and do not distinguish between Anti-Semitism in the correct Catholic sense, as explained above, and “Anti-Semitism,” as the Jews understand it. For the Jews, “Anti-Semitism” is anything that is in opposition to the naturalistic Messianic domination of their nation over all the others. Quite logically, the leaders of the Jewish nation hold that to stand for the Rights of Christ the King is to be “Anti-Semitic.”| Father Denis Fahey, C.S.S.p., B.A., D. Ph.D, D.D.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cfnews.org/Fahey-AntiSemitism.htm&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Antecedents of Christian antisemitism==
In Rome and throughout the [[Roman Empire]], religion was an integral part of the civil government. The Emperor was from time to time declared to be a god and demanded to be worshiped accordingly.&lt;ref name=lazare63&gt;Lazare, Bernard. ''op cit''. p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; This created religious difficulties for [[Jew]]s, who were prohibited from worshiping any other god than that of the [[Hebrew Bible]]. This created problems in the relations between Rome and its Jewish subjects, as well as for worshipers of [[Mithras]], worshipers of [[Sabazius]], and [[Christianity]].&lt;ref name=lazare64&gt;Lazare, Bernard. ''op cit''. p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of Jews, this led to several revolts against Rome and severe persecutions by Rome as punishment. Though Romans inherited pagan antipathy to Jews and Judaism from the Greeks, their attitudes were not theological and could not be described as anti-Judaic. The Roman objection was essentially to the refusal of Jews to &quot;bend the knee&quot; to their Roman overlord.

Many of the early gentile converts to Christianity probably came from and shared this cultural bias. As gentile converts they also were not well acquainted with the internal life of the Jewish community. Hence they read many of the New Testament texts as condemnations of Judaism as such, rather than as internal differences which were commonplace within the Jewish community.

==Early differences==

&quot;This is not an uncommon impression and one finds it sometimes among Jews as well as Christians - that Judaism is the religion of the Hebrew Bible. It is, of course, a fallacious impression. Judaism is not the religion of the Bible.&quot; [Rabbi Ben Zion Bokser, Judaism and the Christian Predicament, New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1967, p.&amp;nbsp;59, 159]

&quot;The Jewish religion as it is today traces its descent, without a break, through all the centuries, from the Pharisees. Their leading ideas and methods found expression in a literature of enormous extent, of which a very great deal is still in existence. The Talmud is the largest and most important single member of that literature, and round it are gathered a number of Midrashim, partly legal (Halachic) and partly works of edification (Haggadic). This literature, in its oldest elements, goes back to a time before the beginning of the Common Era, and comes down into the Middle Ages. Through it all run the lines of thought which were first drawn by the Pharisees, and the study of it is essential for any real understanding of Pharisaism.&quot; [Universal Jewish Encyclopedia, Vol. 3 pg. 474]

“Pharisaism became Talmudism, Talmudism became Medieval Rabbinism, and Medieval Rabbinism became Modern Rabbinism. But throughout these changes of name, inevitable adaptation of custom, and adjustment of Law, the spirit of the ancient Pharisee survives unaltered.” [Rabbi Dr. Finkelstein, The Pharisees: The Sociological Background of Their Faith, pg. xxi]

&quot;The Talmud is the written form of that which in the time of Jesus, was called the 'Tradition of the Elders,' and to which He makes frequent allusions.&quot; [Michael L. Rodkinson, The History of the Talmud: From The Time Of Its Formation About 200 B. C. Up To The Present Time, Kessinger Publishing, LLC (June 8, 2006), ISBN 978-1428631366, p.&amp;nbsp;70]

“The complex of rabbinically ordained practices ... including most of the rules for the treatment of Scripture itself—do not derive from Scripture at all. Rabbinic Judaism's initial concern was with the elaboration and refinement of its own system. Attaching the system to scripture was secondary. It therefore is misleading to depict rabbinic Judaism primarily as a consequence of an exegetical process or the organic unfolding of Scripture. Rather, rabbinic Judaism began as the work of a small, ambitious, and homogeneous group of pseudo-priests ...By the third century (A.D.) the rabbis expressed their self-conception in the ideology of &quot;oral Torah&quot; which held that a comprehensive body of teachings and practices (halachot) not included in Scripture had been given by God and through Moses only to the rabbinic establishment.” (Rabbinic Judaism: Structure and System, Jacob Nuesner, pp.&amp;nbsp;31–34)

There have been philosophical differences between Christianity and Rabbinical [[Judaism]] since the founding of Christianity. Christians acknowledge the roots of Christianity in Judaism. Some claim the entirety of Jewish religious heritage as its own, while interpreting it very differently.

Debates between the [[Early Christianity|Early Christians]], who at first saw themselves as a movement within Judaism and not as a separate religion, and other Jews initially revolved around the question whether Jesus was the [[Messiah]], which also encompassed the issue of his divinity. Once [[gentiles]] were converted to Christianity, the question arose whether and how far these gentile Christians were obliged to follow Jewish law in order to follow Jesus (see Paul's [[letter to the Galatians]]). At the [[Council of Jerusalem]],{{Bibleref2c|Acts|15|NIV}} it was decided that new gentile converts did not need to be [[Circumcision in the Bible|circumcised]] (the ''Apostolic Decree'' of {{Bibleref2|Acts|15:19-21|NIV}}), while requiring acceptance of Judaism's [[Noahide Law]], (see also [[Old Testament#Christian view of the Law]] for the modern debate), but Paul also [[Abrogation of Old Covenant laws|questioned the validity]] of [[Jewish Christian]]s' adherence to the Jewish law in relation to faith in Christ (see also.

The increase of the numbers of gentile Christians in comparison to Jewish Christians eventually resulted in a rift between Christianity and Judaism, which was further increased by the [[Jewish-Roman wars]] (66–73 and 132–135) that drove many more Jews into the [[diaspora]] and reduced the influence of the [[Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem#Bishops of Jerusalem|Bishop of Jerusalem]], leader of the first Christian church. Early Christians also found in the Old Testament prophecies which seemed to indicate that God's original covenant with the Jews would be expanded to include also the Gentiles. Thus the Church Fathers tend to emphasise that the Church is the new &quot;spiritual&quot; Israel, completing or replacing the earthly Israel which was but its prototype. In modern times, this view would come to be called &quot;[[Supersessionism]]&quot;.

Also, the two religions differed in their legal status in the [[Roman Empire]]: Judaism, restricted to the [[Jewish people]] and Jewish [[Proselytes]], was generally exempt from obligation to the [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|Roman imperial cult]] and since the reign of [[Julius Caesar]] enjoyed the status of a &quot;licit religion&quot;, though there were also occasional persecutions, for example in 19 [[Tiberius]] expelled the Jews from Rome,&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, [[Lives of the Twelve Caesars]], Tiberius 36&lt;/ref&gt; as [[Claudius]] did again in 49.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, Lives of the Twelve Caesars, Claudius XXV.4, referenced in {{Bibleref2|Acts|18:2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christianity however was not restricted to one people, and as Jewish Christians were excluded from the [[synagogue]] (see [[Council of Jamnia]]), they also lost the protection of the status of Judaism, though said ''protection'' did have its limits (see for example [[Titus Flavius Clemens (consul)]], [[Akiba ben Joseph]], and [[Ten Martyrs]]).

From the reign of [[Nero]] onwards Christianity was considered to be illegal and Christians were frequently subjected to [[Persecution of Christians#Persecution of early Christians in the Roman Empire|persecution]], differing regionally. Comparably, Judaism suffered the setbacks of the [[Jewish-Roman wars]]. [[Robin Lane Fox]] traces the origin of much later hostility to the period of persecution, where the commonest test by the authorities of a suspected Christian was to require homage to be paid to the deified emperor. Jews were exempt from this requirement, and Christians (many or mostly of Jewish origins) would say they were Jewish. This had to be confirmed by the local Jewish authorities, who were likely to refuse to accept the Christians were Jewish, often leading to their execution.&lt;ref&gt;In [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=bBqOAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Pagans+and+Christians%22+Robin+Lane+Fox&amp;dq=%22Pagans+and+Christians%22+Robin+Lane+Fox&amp;pgis=1 ''Pagans and Christians'']&lt;/ref&gt; In the 3rd century systematic persecution of Christians began and lasted until [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine]]'s conversion to Christianity. In 390 [[Theodosius I]] made Christianity the [[state religion]]. While pagan cults and [[Manichaeism]] were suppressed, Judaism retained its legal status as a licit religion, though anti-Jewish violence still occurred. In the 5th century, some legal measures worsened the status of the Jews in the Roman Empire.

==New Testament rejection of Judaism==
{{Main|New Testament rejection of Judaism}}
{{See also|Persecution of Christians in the New Testament}}
{{Ref improve section|date=February 2007}}

A number of passages in the New Testament may be considered as a rejection of Judaism {{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} given a certain interpretive approach. Among them are:
:For you, brethren, became imitators of the churches of God in Christ Jesus which are in Judea; for you suffered the same things from your own countrymen as they did from the Jews, who killed both the Lord Jesus and the prophets, and drove us out, and displease God and oppose all men.
* criticisms of Jewish parochialism or particularism
* criticisms of Jews being children of the devil and the like{{Bibleref2c|Jn|8:44-47}}
* criticisms of the [[Pharisees]]{{Bibleref2c|Mt.|23}}
* the assertion that the Jewish covenant with God has been [[Supersessionism|superseded]] by a [[New Covenant]]
* the explication of the Jewish role in the Passion of Jesus. This is exemplified by {{Bibleref2|1Thes|2:14-15|NKJV|1&amp;nbsp;Thessalonians 2:14-15}}:

These elements of the New Testament have their origins in 1st-century history. Christianity began as a revision of Judaism. Many of Jesus' followers during his life were Jews, and it was even a matter of confusion, many years after his death, as to whether non-Jews could even be considered Christians at all, according to the way some{{Who|date=March 2008}} interpret the [[Council of Jerusalem]].

Although the Gospels offer accounts of confrontations and debates between Jesus and other Jews, such conflicts were common among Jews at the time. Scholars disagree on the historicity of the Gospels, and have offered different interpretations of the complex relationship between Jewish authorities and Christians before and following Jesus' death. These debates hinge on the meaning of the word &quot;messiah,&quot; and the claims of [[Early Christians]].

===Rejection of Jesus as the Messiah===
{{See also|Rejection of Jesus}}

Christianity says that Jesus is the [[Messiah]] which Judaism does not accept.

The [[Gospels]] claim that Jesus was a preacher, healer, and messiah. There is no reason to think Jesus would have come into conflict with Jewish authorities in 1st century Judea on account of his preaching and healing. However, claims that he was the Messiah were more controversial. The Hebrew word ''mashiyakh'' (משיח) typically signified a man, chosen by God or descended from a man chosen by God, to serve as a civil and military authority. If Jesus made this claim during his life, it is not surprising that many Jews, weary of [[Roman Empire|Roman]] occupation, would have supported him as a liberator. It is also likely that Jewish authorities would have been cautious, out of fear of Roman reprisal.

Jesus was considered by Christians to be the Messiah, while for most Jews the death of Jesus would have been sufficient proof that he was not the [[Jewish Messiah]]. If early Christians preached that Jesus was [[Second Coming|about to return]], it is virtually certain that Jewish authorities would have opposed them out of fear of Roman reprisal.

Such fears would have been well grounded: Jews revolted against the Romans in 66 CE, which culminated with the destruction of the [[Second Temple]] in 70 CE. They [[Bar Kokhba's revolt|revolted]] again under the leadership of the professed messiah [[Simon Bar Kokhba]] in 132 CE, which culminated in the expulsion of the Jews from the [[Land of Israel]], which [[Hadrian]] renamed into [[Syria Palæstina|Palestine]] to wipe out memory of Jews there.

At the time, Christianity was still considered a sect of Judaism, but the messianic claims alienated many Christians (including Jewish converts) and sharply deepened the [[Schism (religion)|schism]].

===Observance of Mosaic law===
{{See also|Biblical law in Christianity|Circumcision controversy in early Christianity}}

Another source of tension between early Christians and Jews was the question of observance of Mosaic Law. Early Christians were divided over the issue: Some [[Jewish Christians]], argued that Christians were bound to observe Mosaic law{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}, while [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] argued that not all of Mosaic Law applied to Christians{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}. The issue was argued especially in the context of whether Gentile converts were obligated to undergo [[History of male circumcision|circumcision]], which was a requirement for male Jews. The issue was hotly debated in the 1st century and settled at the [[Council of Jerusalem]], in which Paul and Barnabas participated as representatives of the church at Antioch. The Council decided that Gentile converts were not subject to most [[613 Commandments|Mosaic Law]], including circumcision, but required them to stay away from eating meat with blood still on it, eating the meat of strangled animals, eating food offered to idols, and sexual immorality. See also [[Noahide Law]] and [[Proselyte]].

Many have interpreted Paul's writings as other parts of the New Testament ‎as [[Abrogation of Old Covenant laws|ending the requirements of the Jewish law]]. A small number of historians{{Who|date=March 2008}} suggest that Paul accepted the authority of the law, but understood that it excluded non-Jews. This is not a generally accepted view. See [[Proselyte]] and [[New Perspective on Paul]]. An example of another view is represented by the [[Catholic Encyclopedia]] article on [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08537a.htm Judaizers]:
:Paul, on the other hand, not only did not object to the observance of the Mosaic Law as long as it did not interfere with the liberty of the Gentiles but also he conformed to its prescriptions when occasion required.{{Bibleref2c|1Cor|9:20|NIV|1 Cor 9:20}} Thus he shortly after [the Council of Jerusalem] circumcised Timothy,{{Bibleref2c|Acts|16:1–3}} and he was in the very act of observing the Mosaic ritual when he was arrested at Jerusalem.{{bibleref2c|Acts|21:26||21:26 sqq}}

===Conversion of Gentiles to Judaism===
Some {{Who|date=March 2008}} say that by replacing the written law (the [[Torah]]) with Christ as the sign of the covenant, Paul sought to transform Judaism into a universal religion. It is evident that Paul saw himself as a Jew, but other Jews rejected this universalism; after Paul's death, Christianity emerged as a separate religion, and [[Pauline Christianity]] emerged as the dominant form of Christianity, especially after Paul, James and the other apostles agreed on a compromise set of requirements.{{Bibleref2c|Acts|15}} Some Christians continued to adhere to Jewish law, but they were few in number and often considered [[Christian heresy|heretics]] by the Church. One example is the [[Ebionites]], which, according to the [[Catholic Encyclopedia]], were &quot;infected with Judaistic errors&quot; (language which Jews find offensive{{citation needed|date=April 2011}}); for instance, they denied the [[Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine)|virgin birth]] of Jesus, the physical [[Resurrection of Jesus]], and most of the books that were later [[biblical canon|canonized]] as the [[New Testament]], see also &quot;[[Judaizers]]&quot; (a term which Jews find offensive{{citation needed|date=April 2011}}). For example, the [[Ethiopian Orthodox]] are often accused of being Judaizers because they still observe [[Old Testament]] teachings such as the [[Shabbat|Sabbath]], and conversely they accuse their opponents of residual [[Marcionism]]. As late as the 4th century [[Church Father]] [[John Chrysostom]] complained (see [[John Chrysostom#Sermons on Jews and Judaizing Christians]]) that some Christians were still attending Jewish synagogues.

===Criticism of the Pharisees===
{{Main|Woes of the Pharisees}}
Many New Testament passages criticise the [[Pharisees]] and it has been argued that these passages have shaped the way that Christians viewed Jews. Like most Bible passages, however, they can and have been interpreted in a variety of ways.

During Jesus' life and at the time of his execution, the Pharisees were only one of several Jewish groups such as the [[Sadducee]]s, [[Zealot]]s, and [[Essene]]s; indeed, some have suggested that Jesus was himself a Pharisee. Arguments by Jesus and his disciples against the Pharisees and what he saw as their hypocrisy were most likely examples of disputes among Jews and internal to Judaism that were common at the time. ([[Lutheran]] [[Pastor]] John Stendahl has pointed out that &quot;Christianity begins as a kind of Judaism, and we must recognize that words spoken in a family conflict are inappropriately appropriated by those outside the family.&quot;)

===Recent trends===
In recent years teachers{{who|date=April 2011}} in most Christian denominations have begun to teach that readers should understand the New Testament's seeming attacks on Jews as specific charges aimed at certain Jewish leaders of that time, and upon general human attitude.

However, Professor [[Lillian C. Freudmann]], author of ''Antisemitism in the New Testament'' ([[University Press of America]], 1994) has published a detailed study of the treatment of Jews in the New Testament, and the historical effects that such passages have had in the Christian community throughout history. Similar studies of such verses have been made by both Christian and Jewish scholars, including, Professors [[Clark Williamsom]] (Christian Theological Seminary), [[Hyam Maccoby]] (The Leo Baeck Institute), Norman A. Beck (Texas Lutheran College), and Michael Berenbaum (Georgetown University). Most rabbis feel that these verses are antisemitic, and many Christian scholars, in America and Europe, have reached the same conclusion. Another example is [[John Dominic Crossan]]'s 1995 ''Who Killed Jesus? Exposing the Roots of Anti-Semitism in the Gospel Story of the Death of Jesus''.

==The Church Fathers==
{{Main|Antisemitism in patristics}}
Some maintain that a number of early and influential works by the [[Church Fathers]] — such as the dialogues of [[Justin Martyr]], the homilies of [[John Chrysostom]], and the testimonies of [[Cyprian]] — are anti-Jewish.&lt;ref&gt;John Chrysostom, Discourses against Judaizing Christians, translated by Paul W. Harkins. The Fathers of the Church; v. 68 (Washington: Catholic University of America Press, 1979)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Walter Laqueur, ''The Changing Face of Antisemitism: From Ancient Times To The Present Day'', (Oxford University Press: 2006), p. 48. ISBN 0-19-530429-2.  48&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yohanan (Hans) Lewy, &quot;John Chrysostom&quot; in ''[[Encyclopaedia Judaica]]'' (CD-ROM Edition Version 1.0), Ed. Cecil Roth ([[Keter Publishing House]]: 1997). ISBN 965-07-0665-8.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} Others, like [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], argued that the Jews should be left alive, to suffer as a perpetual reminder of their [[deicide|murder of Christ]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

==The emperor Constantine the Great==
{{Main|Constantine I and Judaism}}
[[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine the Great]], who is considered a [[saint]] by the [[Greek Orthodox Church]], instituted several legislative measures concerning the Jews and all other religions excepting Christianity: Non-Christians were forbidden to own Christian slaves or to [[brit milah|circumcise]] their slaves.

==The Middle Ages==
{{Main|Antisemitism in Europe (Middle Ages)}}

===The Emperor Leo I===
The [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] Emperor [[Leo I (emperor)|Leo I]] compiled a code of law, called the ''New Constitutions of Leo''.&lt;ref&gt;Constitution LV: &quot;Jews shall live in accordance with the rites of Christianity. Those who formerly were invested with Imperial authority promulgated various laws with reference to the Hebrew people, who, once nourished by Divine protection, became renowned, but are now remarkable for the calamities inflicted upon them because of their contumacy towards Christ and God; and these laws, while regulating their mode of life, compelled them to read the Holy Scriptures, and ordered them not to depart from the ceremonies of their worship. They also provided that their children should adhere to their religion, being obliged to do so as well by the ties of blood, as on account of the institution of circumcision. These are the laws which I have already stated were formerly enforced throughout the Empire. But the Most Holy Sovereign from whom We are descended, more concerned than his predecessors for the salvation of the Jews, instead of allowing them (as they did) to obey only their ancient laws, attempted, by the interpretation of prophesies and the conclusions which he drew from them, to convert them to the Christian religion, by means of the vivifying water of baptism. He fully succeeded in his attempts to transform them into new men, according to the doctrine of Christ, and induced them to denounce their ancient doctrines and abandon their religious ceremonies, such as circumcision, the observance of the Sabbath, and all their other rites. But although he, to a certain extent, overcame the obstinacy of the Jews, he was unable to force them to abolish the laws which permitted them to live in accordance with their ancient customs. Therefore We, desiring to accomplish what Our Father failed to effect, do hereby annul all the old laws enacted with reference to the Hebrews, and We order that they shall not dare to live in any other manner than in accordance with the rules established by the pure and salutary Christian Faith. And if anyone of them should be proved to have neglected to observe the ceremonies of the Christian religion, and to have returned to his former practices, he shall pay the penalty prescribed by the law for apostates.&quot; [http://www.constitution.org/sps/sps17.htm The Civil Law. The Constitutions of Leo] Translated from the original Latin and edited by S. P. Scott, A. M.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pope Gregory I===
{{Main|Pope Gregory I and Judaism}}
Not all early Christians were antisemitic though. Some, such as [[Pope Gregory I]], spoke out against the antisemitism of their day.

===Sicut Judaeis===
{{Main|Sicut Judaeis}}
''Sicut Judaeis'' (the &quot;Constitution for the Jews&quot;) was the official position of the papacy regarding Jews throughout the Middle Ages and later. The first bull was issued in about 1120 by [[Calixtus II]], intended to protect Jews who suffered during the [[First Crusade]], and was reaffirmed by many popes, even until the 15th century.

The bull forbade, besides other things, Christians from coercing Jews to convert, or to harm them, or to take their property, or to disturb the celebration of their festivals, or to interfere with their cemeteries, on pain of excommunication.&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=History of Toleration}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later Christian writers===
Some{{who|date=April 2011}} later Christian writers have antisemitic statements in their writings. However, other Christians spoke out against antisemitism. What follows is a sampling of writings, words, etc. of those who advocated and those who condemned antisemitism:
* Pope John XVIII 1007: &quot;The Jews of France, victims of persecution, are taken under papal protection.&quot; (The Apostolic See and the Jews, Documents: 492-1404; Simonsohn, Shlomo, p.&amp;nbsp;34)
* Pope Alexander II:
** 1063 &quot;Praise for Winfred, archbishop of Narbonne, for defending the Jews.&quot;
** 1063 &quot;Praise for Berengar, viscount of Narbonne, for protecting the Jews.&quot;
** 1065 &quot;Admonition to Landulf, lord of Benevento, that the conversion of Jews is not to be obtained by force.&quot; [Source for all quotes on this pope: (The Apostolic See and the Jews, Documents: 492-1404; Simonsohn, Shlomo, p.&amp;nbsp;35,36,37)]
* Saint Bernard of Clairvaux (letter to [[Henry I, Archbishop of Mainz]], 1146) &quot;Is it not a far better triumph for the Church to convince and convert the Jews than to put them all to the sword? Has that prayer which the Church offers for the Jews...been instituted in vain?&quot; (Carroll, Warren; The Glory of Christendom, 62).
* Thomas of Monmouth, a monk in the [[Norwich]] Benedictine monastery, wrote in 1173 a detailed antisemitic tractate, called ''The Life and Miracles of St. [[William of Norwich]]'', holding that Jews tortured to death a Christian child during Passover.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unc.edu/courses/pre2000fall/westciv/readings/antisemitism.html Excerpt from the Life and Miracles of St. William of Norwich] by Thomas of Monmouth&lt;/ref&gt;
* Pope Innocent III 1198-1216
** 1199 [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/in3-constjews.html Constitution for the Jews]
** 1199 [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/inn3-jews.html Letter on the Jews]
* [[Thomas Aquinas]] (1225–1274), not imposing, he said, his own judgment but rather urging the judgment of the experts, declared that, &quot;as the laws say, the Jews by reason of their fault are sentenced to perpetual servitude and thus the lords of the lands in which they dwell may take things from them as though they were their own — with, nonetheless, this restraint observed that the necessary subsidies of life in no way be taken from them...[and that] the services coerced from them do not demand things that they had not been accustomed to do in times gone by.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thomistica.net/thomas-aquinass-letter-to-marg/ Thomas Aquinas's letter to Margaret of Flanders]&lt;/ref&gt;
** However, he also argued that the Jews should not be baptized against their will, quoting the council of Toledo: &quot;In regard to the Jews the holy synod commands that henceforward none of them be forced to believe.&quot; [http://www.newadvent.org/summa/4068.htm#article10 ST.III.Q68.A10]
* Pope Gregory IX
** He wrote several decrees to prevent discriminations against Jews (see [[Pope Gregory IX and Judaism]]).
* Pope Gregory X: [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/g10-jews.html Letter on Jews, (1271-76) - Against the Blood Libel] &quot;And most falsely do these Christians claim that the Jews have secretly and furtively carried away these children and killed them, and that the Jews offer sacrifice from the heart and blood of these children, since their law in this matter precisely and expressly forbids Jews to sacrifice, eat, or drink the blood, or to eat the flesh of animals having claws. This has been demonstrated many times at our court by Jews converted to the Christian faith: nevertheless very many Jews are often seized and detained unjustly because of this. We decree, therefore, that Christians need not be obeyed against Jews in a case or situation of this type, and we order that Jews seized under such a silly pretext be freed from imprisonment, and that they shall not be arrested henceforth on such a miserable pretext, unless-which we do not believe-they be caught in the commission of the crime. We decree that no Christian shall stir up anything new against them, but that they should be maintained in that status and position in which they were in the time of our predecessors, from antiquity till now.&quot;
* [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] (1343?-1400) wrote in &quot;The Prioress's Tale&quot; of his ''Canterbury Tales'' of a devout little Christian child who was murdered by Jews affronted at his singing a hymn as he passed through the Jewry, or Jewish quarter, of a city in Asia:

{|
|
:Our primal foe, the serpent Sathanas,
:Who has in Jewish heart his hornets' nest,
:Swelled arrogantly: &quot;O Jewish folk, alas!
:Is it to you a good thing, and the best,
:That such a boy walks here, without protest,
:In your despite and doing such offense
:Against the teachings that you reverence?&quot;
:From that time forth the Jewish folk conspired
:Out of the world this innocent to chase;
:A murderer they found, and thereto hired,
|
:Who in an alley had a hiding-place;
:And as the child went by at sober pace,
:This cursed Jew did seize and hold him fast,
:And cut his throat, and in a pit him cast.
:I say, that in a cesspool him they threw,
:Wherein these Jews did empty their entrails.
:O cursed folk of Herod, born anew,
:How can you think your ill intent avails?
:Murder will out, 'tis sure, nor ever fails,
:And chiefly when God's honour vengeance needs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://classiclit.about.com/library/bl-etexts/gchaucer/bl-gchau-can-pri.htm The Canterbury Tales] by Geoffrey Chaucer&lt;/ref&gt;
|}

:A considerable body of critical and scholarly opinion holds that this speech, in the mouth of the Prioress, represents an ironic inversion of Chaucer's own sentiments: that is, the Prioress is seen as a hypocrite whose cruelty and bigotry belies her conventionally pious pose — a situation typical of the indeterminacy of Chaucer's intentions.
* Pope Martin V
** He declared in 1419: &quot;Whereas the Jews are made in the image of God and a remnant of them will one day be saved, and whereas they have besought our protection: following in the footsteps of our predecessors we command that they be not molested in their synagogues; that their laws, rights, and customs be not assailed; that they be not baptized by force, constrained to observe Christian festivals, nor to wear new badges, and they be not hindered in their business relations with Christians&quot; [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08386a.htm] Martin however issued a bull in 1425 ordering Jews to wear a &quot;badge of infamy&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, David B. ''The problem of slavery in Western culture'', Oxford University Press US, 1988, ISBN 0195056396 p.100&lt;/ref&gt;
** After the Austrian and German Jews appealed to him, he spoke in their favor in 1420 and &quot;in 1422, confirmed the ancient privileges of their race&quot; (Ibid.)
* [[Martin Luther]], founder of [[Lutheranism]], a Christian denomination, at first made overtures towards the Jews, believing that the &quot;evils&quot; of [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]] had prevented their conversion to Christianity. When his call to convert to his version of Christianity was unsuccessful, he became hostile to them and wrote in his book ''[[On the Jews and their Lies]]'' that they were &quot;venomous beasts, vipers, disgusting scum, canders, devils incarnate. Their private houses must be destroyed and devastated, they could be lodged in stables. Let the magistrates burn their synagogues and let whatever escapes be covered with sand and mud. Let them force to work, and if this avails nothing, we will be compelled to expel them like dogs in order not to expose ourselves to incurring divine wrath and eternal damnation from the Jews and their lies.&quot; It is to be noted that the many Lutheran churches and councils across the world have disassociated themselves from these statements. (''See [[Luther and antisemitism]]'')
* [[Pope Clement VIII]] (1536–1605). &quot;All the world suffers from the [[usury]] of the Jews, their monopolies and deceit. They have brought many unfortunate people into a state of poverty, especially the farmers, working class people and the very poor. Then, as now, Jews have to be reminded intermittently that they were enjoying rights in any country since they left Palestine and the Arabian desert, and subsequently their ethical and moral doctrines as well as their deeds rightly deserve to be exposed to criticism in whatever country they happen to live.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;http://omw.macomb.edu/faculty/crawfordt/Three%20Ingredients%20of%20Middle%20East%20Instabilty%20-%20Arab-Israeli%20Conflict%20I.ppt. http://74.125.93.104/search?q=cache:vsTqW-CZEkMJ:omw.macomb.edu/faculty/crawfordt/Three%2520Ingredients%2520of%2520Middle%2520East%2520Instabilty%2520-%2520Arab-Israeli%2520Conflict%2520I.ppt+%22All+the+world+suffers+from+the+ (html version of the powerpoint document)&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[Pope Clement VIII and Judaism]])

===Popular antisemitism===
Antisemitism in popular European Christian culture escalated beginning in the 13th century. [[Blood libels]] and [[host desecration]] drew popular attention and led to many cases of persecution against Jews. Antisemitic imagery such as [[Judensau]] and [[Ecclesia et Synagoga]] recurred in Christian art and architecture.

===Expulsions===
====Expulsion of Jews from England====
{{Main|Edict of Expulsion}}
[[Edward I of England|King Edward I]] expelled all the Jews from England in 1290 (only after ransoming some 3,000 among the most wealthy of them), on the accusation of [[usury]] and undermining loyalty to the dynasty.

====Expulsion of Jews from Spain====
In 1492 [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] and [[Isabella I of Castile]], the rulers of [[Spain]] who financed [[Christopher Columbus]]' voyage to the New World just a few months later in 1492, declared that all Jews in their territories should either convert to Catholicism or leave the country. While some converted, many others left for [[Portugal]], [[France]], [[Italy]] (including the [[Papal States]]), [[Netherlands]], [[Poland]], the [[Ottoman Empire]], and [[North Africa]]. Many of those who had fled to Portugal were latter expelled by [[Manuel I of Portugal|King Manuel]] in 1497 or left to avoid forced conversion and [[Marranos|persecution]].

==19th- and 20th-century==
===WWI to the eve of the WWII===
{{Main|Pope Benedict XV and Judaism}}
In 1916, in the midst of the [[First World War]], American Jews petitioned Pope Benedict XV on behalf of the Polish Jews.

On April 26, 1933 Hitler declared during a meeting with Roman Catholic Bishop [[Wilhelm Berning]] of Osnabrück:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
“I have been attacked because of my handling of the Jewish question. The Catholic Church considered the Jews pestilent for fifteen hundred years, put them in ghettos, etc., because it recognized the Jews for what they were. In the epoch of liberalism the danger was no longer recognized. I am moving back toward the time in which a fifteen-hundred-year-long tradition was implemented. I do not set race over religion, but I recognize the representatives of this race as pestilent for the state and for the Church, and perhaps I am thereby doing Christianity a great service by pushing them out of schools and public functions.”
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The transcript of this discussion contains no response by Bishop Berning. [[Martin Rhonheimer]] does not consider this unusual since, in his opinion, for a Catholic Bishop in 1933 there was nothing particularly objectionable &quot;in this historically correct reminder&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;firstthings.com&quot;&gt;&quot;''The Holocaust: What Was Not Said''&quot;, [[Martin Rhonheimer]], First Things Magazine, November 2003, retrieved 1 July 2009 [http://www.firstthings.com/article/2007/01/the-holocaust-what-was-not-said-10]&lt;/ref&gt;

Pope Pius XI, who was pontiff prior to the outbreak of the Second World War, was particularly opposed to antisemitism.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}
{{Main|Pope Pius XI and Judaism}}

===Nazi antisemitism===
Archbishop [[Robert Runcie]] asserts that: &quot;Without centuries of Christian antisemitism, Hitler's passionate hatred would never have been so fervently echoed...because for centuries Christians have held Jews collectively responsible for the death of [[Jesus]]. On Good Friday Jews, have in times past, cowered behind locked doors with fear of a Christian mob seeking 'revenge' for deicide. Without the poisoning of Christian minds through the centuries, the Holocaust is unthinkable.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;''After the evil: Christianity and Judaism in the shadow of the Holocaust&quot;'', Richard Harries, p. 21, Oxford University Press, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; The dissident Catholic priest [[Hans Küng]] has written that &quot;Nazi anti-Judaism was the work of godless, anti-Christian criminals. But it would not have been possible without the almost two thousand years' pre-history of 'Christian' anti-Judaism...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hans Küng, ''On Being a Christian'' (Doubleday, Garden City NY, 1976), p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to American [[historian]] [[Lucy Dawidowicz]], antisemitism has a long history within Christianity. The line of &quot;antisemitic descent&quot; from Luther, the author of [[On the Jews and Their Lies]], to Hitler is &quot;easy to draw.&quot; In her ''[[The War Against the Jews]], 1933-1945'', she contends that Luther and Hitler were obsessed by the &quot;demonologized universe&quot; inhabited by Jews. Dawidowicz writes that the similarities between Luther's anti-Jewish writings and modern antisemitism are no coincidence, because they derived from a common history of ''Judenhass'', which can be traced to [[Haman (Bible)|Haman's]] advice to [[Ahasuerus]]. Although modern German antisemitism also has its roots in German [[nationalism]] and the [[liberalism|liberal]] revolution of 1848, [[Christianity|Christian]] antisemitism she writes is a foundation that was laid by the [[Roman Catholic]] Church and &quot;upon which Luther built.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''The War Against the Jews, 1933-1945''. First published 1975; this Bantam edition 1986, p.23. ISBN 055334532X&lt;/ref&gt; Dawidowicz' allegations and positions are criticized and not accepted by most historians however. For example, in &quot;Studying the Jew&quot; Alan Steinweis notes that, &quot;Old-fashioned antisemitism, Hitler argued, was insufficient, and would lead only to pogroms, which contribute little to a permanent solution. This is why, Hitler maintained, it was important to promote 'an antisemitism of reason,' one that acknowledged the racial basis of Jewry.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;(Studying the Jew: Scholarly Antisemitism in Nazi Germany by Alan Steinweis :8)&lt;/ref&gt; Interviews with Nazis by other historians show that the Nazis thought that their views were rooted in biology, not historical prejudices. For example, &quot;S. became a missionary for this biomedical vision... As for anti-Semitic attitudes and actions, he insisted that 'the racial question... [and] resentment of the Jewish race... had nothing to do with medieval anti-Semitism...' That is, it was all a matter of scientific biology and of community.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;(The Nazi Doctors: Medical Killing and the Psychology of Genocide by Robert Lifton :130)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Opposition to the Holocaust====
The [[Confessing Church]] was, in 1934, the first Christian opposition group. The Catholic Church officially condemned the Nazi theory of racism in Germany in 1937 with the [[Encyclical]] &quot;[[Mit Brennender Sorge]]&quot;, signed by [[Pope Pius XI]], and Cardinal [[Michael von Faulhaber]] led the Catholic opposition, preaching against racism. 

Many individual Christian clergy and laypeople of all denominations had to pay for their opposition with their life, including:
* Catholic priest, [[Maximilian Kolbe]].
* Lutheran pastor [[Dietrich Bonhoeffer]]
* the Catholic parson of Berlin Cathedral, [[Bernhard Lichtenberg]].
* the mostly Catholic members of the [[Munich]] resistance group [[White Rose]] around [[Hans Scholl|Hans]] and [[Sophie Scholl]].

By the 1940s fewer Christians were willing to oppose Nazi policy publicly, but many secretly helped save the lives of Jews. There are many sections of Israel's Holocaust Remembrance Museum, [[Yad Vashem]], dedicated to honoring these &quot;[[Righteous Among the Nations]]&quot;.

====Pope Pius XII====
See ([[Pope Pius XII and Judaism]]).

Before becoming Pope, Cardinal Pacelli presided as [[Papal Legate]] over the [[International Eucharistic Congress]] in [[Budapest]] on 25–30 May 1938.&lt;ref&gt;Marchione, 2002, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; At this time antisemitic laws were in the process of being formulated in Hungary. Pacelli made reference to the Jews &quot;''whose lips curse [Christ] and whose hearts reject him even today&quot;''.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;''Christian responses to the Holocaust: moral and ethical issues

Catholic University of America Press. p. 132&lt;/ref&gt; but drafted by the future [[Pope Pius XII]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Pham45&quot;&gt;Pham, p. 45, quote: &quot;When Pius XI was complimented on the publication, in 1937, of his encyclical denouncing Nazism, ''Mit Brennender Sorge'', his response was to point to his Secretary of State and say bluntly, 'The credit is his.'&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; and read from the pulpits of all German Catholic churches, it condemned Nazi ideology and has been characterized by scholars as the &quot;first great official public document to dare to confront and criticize [[Nazism]]&quot; and &quot;one of the greatest such condemnations ever issued by the Vatican.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bokenkotter, pp. 389–392, quote &quot;And when Hitler showed increasing belligerence toward the Church, Pius met the challenge with a decisiveness that astonished the world. His encyclical ''Mit Brennender Sorge'' was the 'first great official public document to dare to confront and criticize Nazism' and 'one of the greatest such condemnations ever issued by the Vatican.' Smuggled into Germany, it was read from all the Catholic pulpits on Palm Sunday in March 1937. It denounced the Nazi &quot;myth of blood and soil&quot; and decried its neopaganism. The Nazis retaliated by closing and sealing all the presses that had printed it and took numerous vindictive measures against the Church, including staging a long series of immorality trials of Catholic clergy.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 1942, Pius explained to his college of Cardinals the reasons for the great gulf that existed between Jews and Christians at the theological level: &quot;''Jerusalem has responded to His call and to His grace with the same rigid blindness and stubborn ingratitude that has led it along the path of guilt to the murder of God.&quot;'' Historian Guido Knopp describes these comments of Pius as being &quot;''incomprehensible''&quot; at a time when &quot;''Jerusalem was being murdered by the million''&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Knopp, Guido. ''Hitler's Holocaust'', Sutton,2000, p. 250, ISBN 0750927003&lt;/ref&gt; This traditional adversarial relationship with Judaism would be reversed in [[Nostra Aetate]] issued during the Second Vatican Council.&lt;ref&gt;Kessler, Edward, Neil Wenborn.'' A dictionary of Jewish-Christian relations''&quot;, p. 86, Cambridge University Press, 2005, ISBN 0521826926&lt;/ref&gt;

However, prominent members of the Jewish community contradicted the criticisms of Pius and spoke highly of his efforts to protect Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Bokenkotter, Thomas (2004). A Concise History of the Catholic Church. Doubleday. pp. 480–481, quote: &quot;A recent article by American rabbi, David G. Dalin, challenges this judgment. He calls making Pius XII a target of moral outrage a failure of historical understanding, and he thinks Jews should reject any 'attempt to usurp the Holocaust' for the partisan purposes at work in this debate. Dalin surmises that well-known Jews such as Albert Einstein, Golda Meir, Moshe Sharett, and Rabbi Isaac Herzog would likely have been shocked at these attacks on Pope Pius. ... Dalin points out that Rabbi Herzog, the chief rabbi of Israel, sent a message in February 1944 declaring 'the people of Israel will never forget what His Holiness ... (is) doing for our unfortunate brothers and sisters in the most tragic hour of our history.'&quot; Dalin cites these tributes as recognition of the work of the Holy See in saving hundreds of thousands of Jews.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The Israeli historian [[Pinchas Lapide]] interviewed war survivors and concluded that Pius XII &quot;was instrumental in saving at least 700,000, but probably as many as 860,000&amp;nbsp;Jews from certain death at Nazi hands&quot;. Some historians dispute this estimate.&lt;ref&gt;Deák, István (2001). Essays on Hitler's Europe. University of Nebraska Press. p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The &quot;White Power&quot; movement===
[[Image:proper hands.jpg|thumb|right|'''In Proper Hands.''' Protestant Christian dominated KKK hinting at violence toward Jews and Catholics. Illustration by Rev. [[Branford Clarke]] from ''[[Heroes of the Fiery Cross]]'' 1928 by Bishop [[Alma White]] published by the [[Pillar of Fire Church]] in [[Zarephath, NJ]].]]

The [[Christian Identity]] movement, the [[Ku Klux Klan]] and other [[White supremacy]] groups have expressed antisemitic views. They claim that their antisemitism is based on purported Jewish control of the media,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalvanguard.org/story.php?id=4231 Updated: Who Rules America?] by Kevin Alfred Strom and National Vanguard staff (National Vanguard) November 20, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; international banks, radical left wing politics, and the promotion of [[multiculturalism]], anti-Christian groups, [[liberalism]] and perverse organizations. They rebuke charges of [[racism]] and claim Jews who share their ideology maintain membership in their organizations. A racial belief common among these groups, but not universal, is an [[Historical revisionism (political)|alternative history]] doctrine, sometimes called [[British Israelism]]. In some forms this doctrine absolutely denies that modern Jews have any racial connection to Israel of the Bible. Instead, according to extreme forms of this doctrine the true racial Israel and true humans are the Adamic (white) race.

These groups are often rejected and not considered to be Christian groups by mainstream Christian denominations as well as the vast majority of Christians around the world.

===Post World War II antisemitism===
Antisemitism in Europe remains a substantial problem. Antisemitism exists to a lesser or greater degree in many other nations as well, including Eastern Europe, the former Soviet Union, and the occasional tensions between some [[Islam in Europe|Muslim]] immigrants and Jews across Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2004-11-22-jews-france_x.htm As attacks rise in France, Jews flock to Israel]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/841445.html Jews for Le Pen] by Daniel Ben-Simon. Haaretz. 25/03/07&lt;/ref&gt; The [[US State Department]] reports that antisemitism has increased dramatically in Europe and Eurasia since 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/40258.htm State Department Report on Anti-Semitism: Europe and Eurasia: anti-Semitism in Europe increased in recent years] (2005 report)&lt;/ref&gt;

While in a decline since the 1940s, there is still a measurable amount of antisemitism in the United States of America as well, although acts of violence are rare. The 2001 survey by the [[Anti-Defamation League]] reported 1432 acts of antisemitism in the United States that year. The figure included 877 acts of harassment, including verbal intimidation, threats and physical assaults.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adl.org/PresRele/ASUS_12/4057_12.asp ADL Audit: Anti-Semitic Incidents in U.S. Declined in 2001 Americans Reject Conspiracy Theories Blaming Jews for 9/11] (2002 report)&lt;/ref&gt; Antisemitic pronouncements still occur, however. John Hagee, a leading proponent of &quot;Christian Zionism,&quot; reiterated a view—the popularity of which is very hard to gauge but must nonetheless be considered not simply isolated—that the Jews brought the Holocaust upon themselves by angering God.&lt;ref&gt;[www.huffingtonpost.com/max-blumenthal/my-interview-with-pastor_b_103177.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jewish converts==
{{See also|Jews for Jesus}}
The Southern Baptist Convention (SBC), the largest Protestant Christian denomination in the U.S., has explicitly rejected suggestions that it should back away from seeking to convert Jews, a position that critics have called antisemitic, but that Baptists see as consistent with their view that salvation is found solely through faith in Christ. In 1996 the SBC approved a resolution calling for efforts to seek the conversion of Jews &quot;as well as for the salvation of 'every kindred and tongue and people and nation.'&quot;

Most [[Evangelicalism|Evangelicals]] agree with the SBC position, and some have been supporting efforts specifically seeking Jews' conversion. At the same time these groups are among the most pro-Israeli groups. (''For more, see [[Christian Zionism]]''.) Among the controversial groups that has found support from some Evangelical churches is [[Jews for Jesus]], which claims that Jews can &quot;complete&quot; their Jewish faith by accepting Jesus as the Messiah.

The [[Presbyterian Church USA|Presbyterian Church (USA)]], the [[United Methodist Church]], and the [[United Church of Canada]] have ended their efforts to convert Jews. While [[Anglicans]] do not, as a rule, seek converts from other Christian denominations,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anglicancommunion.org/acns/news.cfm/2003/5/20/ACNS3443 Anglican Communion News Service: European Anglicans set common goals at Madrid consultation&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; the General Synod has affirmed that &quot;the good news of salvation in Jesus Christ is for all and must be shared with all including people from other faiths or of no faith and that to do anything else would be to institutionalize discrimination&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thinkinganglicans.org.uk/archives/003647.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Roman Catholic Church]] formerly had religious congregations specifically aimed to conversion of Jews. Some of these were founded by Jewish converts themselves, like the Community of Our Lady of Zion, which was composed of [[nun]]s and ordained [[priest]]s. Many Catholic saints were noted specifically because of their missionary zeal in converting Jews, such as [[Vincent Ferrer]]. After the [[Second Vatican Council]] many missionary orders aimed at converting Jews to Christianity no longer actively sought to missionize (or [[proselytism|proselytize]]) among Jews. [[Traditionalist Catholic|Traditionalist Roman Catholic]] groups, congregations and clergymen, however, continue to support missionizing Jews according to traditional patterns, sometimes with success (''e.g.'', the [[Society of St. Pius X]] which has notable Jewish converts among its faithful, many of whom have become traditionalist priests).

Some Jewish organizations have described evangelism and missionary activity directed specifically at Jews as [[antisemitic]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rickross.com/reference/jews_for_jesus/jews_for_jesus6.html Keeping Faith.

==Reconciliation between Judaism and Christian groups==
{{Main|Christian-Jewish reconciliation}}
In recent years there has been much to note in the way of reconciliation between some Christian groups and the Jews. Most of this reconciliation has occurred between the Jewish community and the Catholic Church, and evangelical Christian organizations.

The '''Boeing''' (formerly '''McDonnell Douglas''') '''C-17 Globemaster III''' is a large [[military transport aircraft]]. Developed for the [[United States Air Force]] from the 1980s to the early 1990s by [[McDonnell Douglas]], the C-17 is used for rapid [[airlift|strategic airlift]] of troops and [[cargo]] to [[Main Operating Base|main operating bases]] or [[forward operating base]]s throughout the world; it can also perform tactical airlift, [[medical evacuation]] and [[airdrop]] missions.&lt;ref name=AF_fact&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.af.mil/information/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=86 |title = C-17 fact sheet |publisher = US Air Force |date = 22 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The C-17 carries the name of two previous, unrelated U.S. military cargo aircraft, the [[Douglas C-74 Globemaster]] and the [[Douglas C-124 Globemaster II]].

The C-17 is operated by the U.S. Air Force, the [[Royal Air Force|United Kingdom]], [[Royal Australian Air Force|Australia]], [[Canadian Forces Air Command|Canada]],&lt;ref name=&quot;CF_C-17&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.boeing.com/defense-space/military/c17/news/2007/q3/070808c_nr.html |title = Boeing Delivers Canada's First C-17 |publisher = Boeing |date = 8 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[NATO]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://boeing.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=43&amp;item=764 |title = Multinational Alliance's 1st Boeing C-17 Joins Heavy Airlift Wing in Hungary |publisher = Boeing |date =  27 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Qatar]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Boe_Qatar_1st&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = http://boeing.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=43&amp;item=787 |title = Boeing Delivers Qatar's 1st C-17 Globemaster III |publisher = Boeing |date = 11 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Arab Emirates]] has aircraft on order, and [[India]] has a preliminary agreement to order the aircraft.

==Development==
===Background===
In the 1970s, the U.S. Air Force began looking for a replacement for the [[C-130 Hercules]] tactical airlifter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/djreprints/access/72923084.html?dids=72923084:72923084&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Nov+13%2C+1972&amp;author=&amp;pub=Wall+Street+Journal&amp;desc=Air+Force+Lets+Advanced+STOL+Prototype+Work&amp;pqatl=google |title = Air Force Lets Advanced STOL Prototype Work |publisher = Wall Street Journal |date = 13 November 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Advanced Medium STOL Transport]] (AMST) competition was held, with [[Boeing Integrated Defense Systems|Boeing]] proposing the [[Boeing YC-14|YC-14]], and [[McDonnell Douglas]] proposing the [[McDonnell Douglas YC-15|YC-15]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/660687842.html?dids=660687842:660687842&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Nov+11%2C+1972&amp;author=&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times&amp;desc=McDonnell%2C+Boeing+to+Compete+for+Lockheed+C-130+Successor&amp;pqatl=google |title = McDonnell, Boeing to Compete for Lockheed C-130 Successor |publisher = Los Angeles Times |first = Marvin |last = Miles |date = 11 November 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though both entrants exceeded specified requirements, the AMST competition was canceled before a winner had been selected. The Air Force started the C-X program in November 1979 to develop a larger AMST with longer range to augment its strategic airlift.&lt;ref name=&quot;kennedy_part1&quot;&gt;Kennedy 2004, pp. 3-20, 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Yc15-1 072.jpg|thumb|left|The [[McDonnell Douglas]] [[McDonnell Douglas YC-15|YC-15]] design was used as the basis for the C-17.|alt=Top view of cargo aircraft in-flight, trialed by a fighter chase plane. Under each wing are two engines suspended forward ahead the leading edge. ]]

By 1980, the USAF found itself with a large fleet of aging [[C-141 Starlifter]] cargo aircraft. Compounding matters, USAF historically never possessed sufficient strategic airlift capabilities to fulfill its airlift requirements. The USAF set mission requirements and released a request for proposals (RFP) for C-X in October 1980. McDonnell Douglas elected to develop a new aircraft based on the YC-15; Boeing bid an enlarged three-engine version of its AMST YC-14. Lockheed submitted two designs, a C-5-based design and an enlarged C-141 design. On 28 August 1981, McDonnell Douglas was chosen to build its proposed aircraft, by then designated ''C-17''. The new aircraft differed in having swept wings, increased size, and more powerful engines.&lt;ref name=&quot;norton p12-3&quot;&gt;Norton 2001, pp. 12–13.&lt;/ref&gt; This would allow it to perform all work performed by the C-141, but to also fulfill some of the duties of the [[C-5 Galaxy]], freeing the C-5 fleet for outsize cargo.&lt;ref name=&quot;norton p12-3&quot;/&gt;

The C-5 has a lower LCN than the C-17, although the U.S. Air Force places both in the same broad Load Classification Group (LCG). When considering runway dimensions and their load ratings, the C-17's worldwide runway advantage over the C-5 shrank from 6,400 to 911 airfields.&lt;ref name=&quot;airfields&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = http://archive.gao.gov/t2pbat3/152088.pdf |title = Comparison of C-5 and C-17 Airfield Availability |publisher = United States General Accounting Office |date=July 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the C-17's ability to use lower quality, austere airfields was not considered.&lt;ref name=&quot;airfields&quot;/&gt;

A January 1995 GAO report revealed that while the original C-17 budget was US$41.8 billion for 210 aircraft, the 120 aircraft already ordered at that point had already cost US$39.5 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.gao.gov/archive/1995/ns95026.pdf |title = C-17 Aircraft – Cost and Performance Issues |publisher = United States General Accounting Office |date=January 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1994, the U.S. Army had decided it no longer needed the {{convert|60000|lb|abbr=on}} [[Low Altitude Parachute Extraction System]] (LAPES) delivery that the C-17 was supposed to provide, feeling that the {{convert|42000|lb|abbr=on}} capability of the C-130 Hercules was sufficient. It was decided not to conduct C-17 LAPES training beyond the testing of a {{convert|42000|lb|abbr=on}} LAPES delivery. There were still airflow problems that prevented the C-17 from meeting its airdrop requirements. A February 1997 GAO Report revealed that a C-17 with a full payload could not land on {{convert|3000|ft|-2|abbr=on}} wet runways, for simulations suggested {{convert|5000|ft|abbr=on}} was required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.gao.gov/archive/1997/ns97050.pdf |title = C-17 Globemaster – Support of Operation Joint Endevour |publisher = United States General Accounting Office |date=February 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[McDonnell Douglas YC-15|YC-15]] was transferred out of [[Pima Air &amp; Space Museum]] to [[309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group|AMARC]] to be made flightworthy again for further flight tests for the C-17 program in March 1997.&lt;ref name=&quot;BFS&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Bonny, Danny; Barry Fryer; and Martyn Swann |title=AMARC MASDC III, The Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Center, Davis-Monthan AFB, AZ, 1997–2005 |publisher=British Aviation Research Group, |location = Surry, England |year=2006 |isbn=0-906339-07-3, 978-0-906339-07-7 |page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
[[File:C-17 OtwartaRampa.jpg|thumb|Interior of a C-17|alt=The rear cargo door of a C-17 is opening, revealing the huge interior volume of the aircraft.]]

The C-17 is {{convert|174|ft|m}} long and has a wingspan of about {{convert|170|ft|m}}. It can airlift cargo fairly close to a battle area. The size and weight of U.S. mechanized firepower and equipment have grown in recent decades from increased air mobility requirements, particularly for large or heavy non-palletized [[outsize cargo]].

The C-17 is powered by four fully [[Thrust reversal|reversible]], [[Pratt &amp; Whitney PW2000|F117-PW-100]] [[turbofan]] engines (the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] designation for the commercial Pratt and Whitney PW2040, used on the [[Boeing 757]]). Each engine is rated at 40,400&amp;nbsp;lb&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; (180&amp;nbsp;kN) of [[thrust]]. The thrust reversers direct air upward and forward, reducing the chance of [[foreign object damage]] and providing enough thrust to back the aircraft on the ground. The thrust reversers can also be used in flight at idle-reverse for added drag in maximum-rate descents.

[[File:C-17 no169 landing.jpg|thumb|left|C-17 landing, showing its landing gear]]

The aircraft requires a crew of three (pilot, copilot, and loadmaster) for cargo operations. Cargo is loaded through a large aft ramp that accommodates rolling stock, such a 69-ton (63-metric ton) [[M1 Abrams]] tank, other armored vehicles, trucks, and trailers, along with palletized cargo. The cargo compartment is 88 feet (26.82 m) long by 18 feet (5.49 m) wide by 12 feet 4&amp;nbsp;inches (3.76 m) high. The cargo floor has rollers for palletized cargo that can be flipped to provide a flat floor suitable for rolling stock.

Maximum payload of the C-17 is 170,900&amp;nbsp;lb (77,500&amp;nbsp;kg), and its [[Maximum Takeoff Weight]] is 585,000&amp;nbsp;lb (265,350&amp;nbsp;kg). With a payload of 160,000&amp;nbsp;lb (72,600&amp;nbsp;kg) and an initial cruise altitude of 28,000&amp;nbsp;ft (8,500 m), the C-17 has an unrefueled range of about 2,400 nautical miles (4,400&amp;nbsp;km) on the first 71 aircraft, and 2,800 nautical miles (5,200&amp;nbsp;km) on all subsequent extended-range models that include sealed center wing bay as a fuel tank. Boeing informally calls these planes the ''C-17 ER''.&lt;ref name=&quot;bids_c17_fml&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.boeing.com/commercial/airports/arff/arffc17.pdf |title = C-17/C-17 ER Flammable Material Locations |publisher = Boeing |date = 1 May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The C-17's cruise speed is about 450 knots (833&amp;nbsp;km/h) (0.76 Mach).&lt;ref name=AF_fact/&gt; The C-17 is designed to airdrop 102 [[paratrooper]]s and their equipment. The U.S. Army [[BCT Ground Combat Vehicle Program|BCT Ground Combat Vehicle]] is to be transported by the C-17.

[[File:C17 Reverse Thrust.JPG|thumb|A C-17 creates a visible [[vortex]] while using [[Thrust reversal|reverse thrust]] to push the aircraft backwards on a runway.]]

The C-17 is designed to operate from runways as short as 3,500&amp;nbsp;ft (1,064 m) and as narrow as 90&amp;nbsp;ft (27 m). In addition, the C-17 can operate from unpaved, unimproved runways (although with greater chance of damage to the aircraft).&lt;ref name=AF_fact /&gt; The thrust reversers can be used to back the aircraft and reverse direction on narrow taxiways using a three- (or more) point turn.&lt;ref name=AF_fact /&gt;

==Operational history==
===United States Air Force===

The first production model was delivered to [[Charleston Air Force Base]], [[South Carolina]] on 14 July 1993. The first squadron of C-17s, the [[17th Airlift Squadron]], was declared operationally ready on 17 January 1995.&lt;ref name=&quot;nort_units&quot;&gt;Norton 2001, pp. 94–95.&lt;/ref&gt; The C-17 has broken 22 records for oversized payloads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.boeing.com/defense-space/military/c17/news/2001/q4/nr_011128n.htm |title = Boeing C-17 Globemaster III Claims 13 World Records |publisher = Boeing |date = 28 November 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The C-17 was awarded US aviation's most prestigious award, the [[Collier Trophy]] in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.naa.aero/html/awards/index.cfm?cmsid=150 |title = Collier Trophy, 1990–1999 winners |publisher = National Aeronautic Association |accessdate = 1-04-2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:C-17 4.jpg|thumb|left|A USAF C-17 takes off]]

The Air Force originally programmed to buy a total of 120 C-17s, with the last one being scheduled for delivery in November 2004. The fiscal 2000 budget funded another 14 aircraft, primarily for [[Air Mobility Command]] (AMC) support of the [[United States Special Operations Command]] (USSOCOM). Basing of the original 120 C-17s was with the [[437th Airlift Wing]] and [[315th Airlift Wing]] at Charleston AFB, South Carolina, the [[62nd Airlift Wing]] and [[446th Airlift Wing]] at [[McChord Air Force Base]], Washington (first aircraft arrived in July 1999), the [[Air Education and Training Command]]'s (AETC) [[97th Air Mobility Wing]] at [[Altus Air Force Base|Altus AFB]], Oklahoma, and the [[Air Mobility Command]]-gained [[172nd Airlift Wing]] of the [[Mississippi Air National Guard]] at [[Jackson-Evers International Airport]]/ANGB, Mississippi. Although operationally-gained by the [[Air Mobility Command]], the C-17 aircraft assigned to the 172 AW are the only C-17s strictly under direct control of the [[Air National Guard]] (ANG).

[[File:Presidential limousine loaded in aircraft.jpg|thumb|On both domestic and foreign trips, the US [[Presidential state car (United States)|Presidential Limousine]] is transported in a [[C-17 Globemaster III]].]]

Basing of the additional 13 aircraft went to the [[305th Air Mobility Wing]] and [[514th Air Mobility Wing]] at [[McGuire Air Force Base]], New Jersey; the [[3rd Wing]] and [[176th Wing]] at [[Elmendorf Air Force Base]], Alaska; [[15th Airlift Wing]] and [[154th Wing]] at [[Hickam Air Force Base]], Hawaii; and [[60th Air Mobility Wing]] and [[349th Air Mobility Wing]] at [[Travis Air Force Base]], California. An additional 60 units were ordered in May 2002. In FY 2006, eight C-17s were delivered to [[March Joint Air Reserve Base]], California. Although operationally-gained by the [[Air Mobility Command]], these C-17s are the only aircraft strictly under direct control of the [[Air Force Reserve Command]] (AFRC). In 2007, Congress appropriated funds for 10 additional USAF C-17s, bringing the total planned fleet size (on order + delivered) to 190. Additional aircraft were subsequently assigned to [[Dover Air Force Base]], Delaware which had previously been strictly equipped with [[C-5 Galaxy]] aircraft.

The C-17 have been, and continue to be, used to deliver military goods and [[humanitarian aid]] during [[Operation Enduring Freedom]] in [[Afghanistan]] as well as [[Iraq War|Operation Iraqi Freedom]] in [[Iraq]]. On 26 March 2003, 15 USAF C-17s participated in the biggest combat airdrop since the [[United States invasion of Panama]] in December 1989: the night-time airdrop of 1,000 paratroopers from the [[173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team (United States)|173rd Airborne Brigade]] occurred over Bashur, [[Iraq]]. It opened the northern front to combat operations and constituted the largest formation airdrop carried out by the United States since World War II. USAF C-17s have also been used to assist US allies transport military equipment, including Canadian armored vehicles to Afghanistan in 2003 and the redeployment of Australian forces in Australia and the Solomon Islands during the [[Operation Astute|Australian-led military deployment to East Timor]] in 2006. In late September and early November 2006, USAF C-17s flew 15 Canadian [[Leopard_1#Canada2|Leopard C2 tanks]] from Kyrgyzstan into Kandahar in support of the Afghanistan NATO mission.

A C-17 also accompanies the President of the United States on his visits to both domestic and foreign arrangements, consultations, and meetings. The C-17 is used to transport the [[Presidential State Car (United States)|Presidential Limousine]] and security detachments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=NewsLibrary&amp;p_multi=APAB&amp;d_place=APAB&amp;p_theme=newslibrary2&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=10526128375A9604&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM |title = New Mexico Airport runway damaged by President's Cargo Plane |publisher = Associated Press |date = 1 September 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been several occasions where a C-17 has been used to transport the President himself, temporarily gaining the [[Air Force One]] callsign while doing so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=PD&amp;s_site=twincities&amp;p_multi=SP&amp;p_theme=realcities&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EDCB9D2E176DD80&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM |title = C-17 proves its worth in Bosnian Supply effort |publisher = St Paul Pioneer |date = 16 February 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been debate about follow-on orders for the C-17, with the Air Force requesting line shutdown, and members of [[United States Congress|Congress]] attempting to reinstate production. Furthermore, in [[Fiscal year|FY]]2007, the Air Force requested $1.6 billion to deal with what it termed &quot;excessive combat use&quot; on operational airframes.&lt;ref name=&quot;avweek_20060313&quot;&gt;{{cite web |coauthors = Fulghum, D., Butler, A., Barrie, D. |publisher = ''[[Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology]]'' |date = 13 March 2006 |page = 43 |url = http://www.aviationnow.com/search/AvnowSearchResult.do?reference=xml/awst_xml/2006/03/13/AW_03_13_2006_p43-01.xml |title = Boeing's C-17 wins against EADS' A400}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in testimony before a House of Representatives subcommittee on air and land forces, General [[Arthur Lichte]], USAF, the Commander of [[Air Mobility Command]] indicated extending production to another 15 aircraft, bringing the total to 205.

===United Kingdom===

Boeing has marketed the C-17 to many European nations including Belgium, Germany, France, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom. The [[Royal Air Force]] has established an aim of having interoperability and some weapons and capabilities commonality with the [[United States Air Force]]. The UK's 1998 [[Strategic Defence Review]] identified a requirement for a strategic airlifter. The Short-Term Strategic Airlift (STSA) competition commenced in September of that year, however tendering was canceled in August 1999 with some bids identified by ministers as too expensive, including the Boeing/[[British Aerospace|BAe]] C-17 bid, and others unsuitable.&lt;ref name=&quot;business&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first = Dominic |last = O'Connell |title = Political clash haunts MoD deal decision |work = The Business |publisher = Sunday Business Group |date= 5 December 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project continued, with the C-17 seen as the favorite.&lt;ref name=&quot;business&quot;/&gt; In the light of continuing delays to the [[Airbus A400M]] program, the UK [[Secretary of State for Defence|Defence Secretary]], [[Geoff Hoon]], announced in May 2000 that the RAF would lease four C-17s at an annual cost of [[Pound sterling|£]]100 million&lt;ref name=&quot;avweek_20060313&quot;/&gt; from Boeing for an initial seven years with an optional two year extension. At this point the RAF would have the option to buy the aircraft or return them to Boeing. The UK committed to upgrading the C-17s inline with the USAF so that in the event of their being returned to Boeing the USAF could adopt them.

The first C-17 was delivered to the RAF at Boeing's Long Beach facility on 17 May 2001 and flown to [[RAF Brize Norton]] by a crew from [[No. 99 Squadron RAF|No. 99 Squadron]] which had previously trained with USAF crews to gain competence on the type. The RAF's fourth C-17 was delivered on 24 August 2001. The RAF aircraft were some of the first to take advantage of the new center wing fuel tank found in Block 13 aircraft. In RAF service, the C-17 has not been given an [[British military aircraft designation systems|official designation]] (for example,, C-130J referred to as Hercules C4 or C5), but is referred to simply as the C-17 or &quot;C-17A Globemaster&quot;.

[[File:Royal Air Force C-17 August 2010.jpg|thumb|RAF C-17 at RAF Lakenheath, August 2010.]]
The RAF declared itself delighted with the C-17. Although the Globemaster fleet was to be a fallback for the A400M, the UK announced on 21 July 2004 that they had elected to buy their four C-17s at the end of the lease, even though the A400M appeared to be moving closer to production. They also announced there would be a follow-on order for one C-17, with possible additional purchases later.&lt;ref name=&quot;gdr_2003&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.global-defence.com/2003/globe_master.htm |title = RAF's Globe Master |publisher = ''[[Global Defence Review]]'' |year =  2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the A400M is described as a &quot;strategic&quot; airlifter, the C-17 gives the RAF true strategic capabilities that it would not wish to lose, for example a maximum payload of 169,500&amp;nbsp;lb (77,000&amp;nbsp;kg) compared to the Airbus' 82,000&amp;nbsp;lb (37,000&amp;nbsp;kg).&lt;ref name=&quot;avweek_20060313&quot;/&gt;

The [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] (MoD) announced on 4 August 2006 that they had ordered an additional C-17 and that the four aircraft on lease would be purchased at the end of the current contract in 2008. A fifth aircraft was delivered on 22 February 2008 and reported for duty on 7 April 2008 at [[RAF Brize Norton|Brize Norton air base]] in [[Oxfordshire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2008/04/07/222815/pictures-uk-receives-fifth-c-17-as-raf-fleet-passes-40000-flight.html |title = UK receives fifth C-17, as RAF fleet passes 40,000 flight hours |first = Craig |last = Hoyle |publisher = ''FlightGlobal.com'' |date = 14 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to fears that the A400M may suffer further delays, the MoD announced in 2006 that it planned to acquire three more C-17s, for a total of eight, with delivery in 2009–2010. On 26 July 2007, Defence Secretary [[Des Browne]] announced that the MoD intended to order a sixth C-17 to boost operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.&lt;ref name=&quot;UK_6th&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/DefenceNews/EquipmentAndLogistics/BrownePurchaseOfExtraC17WillsignificantlyBoostUkMilitaryOperations.htm |title = Browne: Purchase of extra C-17 will 'significantly boost' UK military operations |publisher = UK Ministry of Defence |date = 27 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 December 2007, the MoD announced a contract for a sixth C-17,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/DefenceNews/EquipmentAndLogistics/RafGetsSixthC17Globemaster.htm |title = RAF gets sixth C-17 Globemaster |publisher = UK Ministry of Defence |date = 4 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was received on 11 June 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.boeing.com/news/releases/2008/q2/080611c_nr.html |title = Boeing Delivers 6th C-17 to Royal Air Force |publisher = Boeing |date = 11 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
[[File:RAAF C-17 Afghanistan.jpg|thumb|An RAAF C-17 in Afghanistan, Dec 2010.]]

The [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) began investigating options to acquire heavy lift transport aircraft for strategic transport in 2005.&lt;ref name=&quot;McLaughlin_40-41&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=McLaughlin |first=Andrew |date=September 2008 |title=Big Mover |journal=Australian Aviation |publisher=Phantom Media |location=Canberra |volume= |pages=40–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2005 the then [[Minister for Defence (Australia)|Minister for Defence]] [[Robert Hill (Australian diplomat)|Robert Hill]] stated that the [[Australian Defence Force]] was considering such aircraft due to the limited availability of strategic airlift aircraft from partner nations and air freight companies. The C-17 was considered to be favoured over the A400M as it was a &quot;proven aircraft&quot; and was already in production. One major requirement from the RAAF was the ability to airlift the [[Australian Army|Army's]] new [[M1 Abrams]] [[main battle tank]]s; another requirement was immediate delivery. Though unstated, commonality with the USAF and the United Kingdom's RAF was also considered advantageous. The aircraft for the RAAF were ordered directly from the USAF production run, and are identical to American C-17 even in paint scheme, the only difference being the [[Military aircraft insignia|national marking]]s. This allowed delivery to commence within nine months of commitment to the program.&lt;ref name=&quot;awst_20061211&quot;&gt;&quot;Stock Standard&quot;. ''[[Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology]]. 11 December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===

Canada has had a long-standing need for strategic airlift for humanitarian and military operations around the world {{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}. The [[Canadian Forces]] (CF) had followed a pattern similar to the [[Luftwaffe]] in using rented [[Antonov]]s and [[Ilyushin]]s for many of their needs, including deploying the [[Disaster Assistance Response Team]] (DART) to tsunami-stricken [[Sri Lanka]] in 2005. The CF was forced to rely entirely on leased [[Antonov An-124|An-124 ''Ruslan'']] for a [[Operation Halo|deployment to Haiti]] in 2003,{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} as well as a combination of leased ''Ruslans'', Ilyushins and USAF C-17s for moving heavy equipment into [[Afghanistan]]. The Canadian Forces Future Strategic Airlifter Project was initiated in 2002 to study alternatives, including long-term leasing arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ploughshares.ca/libraries/monitor/monj05g.htm &quot;Strategic lift capacity for Canada&quot;]. The Ploughshares Monitor, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2009, 205 C-17s were on contract with the USAF. A contract for eight C-17s from the supplemental war funding bill has not yet been awarded. On 18 December 2009, the US Senate passed the FY 2010 DOD budget with funding for 10 C-17s and was signed into law by the President the following day. Total USAF C-17s contracted will be 223 once contracts are awarded, extending production until 2013.

In January 2010, the USAF announced that it would end Boeing's performance-based logistics contracts to maintain the aircraft, which was a key source for projected profit growth for the company.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2010/05/18/341939/why-is-usaf-bringing-maintenance-in-house.html Why is USAF bringing maintenance in-house?]&lt;/ref&gt;

===International===
In February 2009, the [[United Arab Emirates]] signed an agreement to purchase four C-17 airlifters.&lt;ref name=&quot;UAE_order&quot;&gt;Trimble, Stephen.

Flight International, 25 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2010, UAE signed a contract with Boeing for six C-17s (four C-17s in 2011, and two in 2012).&lt;ref name=UAE_order_6&gt;[http://www.indiastrategic.in/topstories461.htm &quot;Boeing, United Arab Emirates Announce Order for 6 C-17s&quot;]. indiastrategic.in, 6 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Boe_UAE_contract&gt;[http://boeing.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=43&amp;item=1019 &quot;Boeing, United Arab Emirates Announce Order for 6 C-17s&quot;].

In June 2009, the [[Indian Air Force]] (IAF) selected the C-17 to fulfill its ''Very Heavy Lift Transport Aircraft'' requirement. The C-17 is to replace the [[Ilyushin Il-76]] as the IAF's largest heavy lift transport aircraft in service.&lt;ref name=DNA&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report_russia-setting-us-rising-in-indian-air-force_1303530 |title= Russia setting, US rising in Indian air force |first= Josy |last= Joseph |publisher= DNA |date= 17 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.indiastrategic.in/topstories331.htm |title=IAF Chooses C 17 Globemaster III |last=Luthra |first=Gulshan |date=19 June 2009 |publisher= IndiaStrategic.in |accessdate= 15 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;C-17_orders_to_extend_line&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/pressReleasesMolt/idUSTRE55F3TC20090616 |title=Boeing says C-17 orders to extend line |date= 16 June 2009 |publisher= Reuters |accessdate= 20 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2010, the US Government received a request from India for 10 C-17s through the US Government's [[Foreign Military Sales]] program,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/generic/story.jsp?id=news/awx/2010/01/08/awx_01_08_2010_p0-195411.xml&amp;headline=India%20Requests%20Boeing%20C-17s&amp;channel=defense &quot;India Requests Boeing C-17s&quot;].

''Deccan Chronicle'', 2 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 June 2010, the Indian Air Force successfully test-landed a USAF C-17 at the Gaggal Airport, India. This completed the IAF's C-17 trials.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.janes.com/news/defence/jdw/jdw100705_1_n.shtml &quot;IAF completes C-17 test-flight&quot;].

During the summer 2008 it was reported that [[South Korea]] had allocated funds for the purchase of three or four C-17-class airplanes for use in supporting expeditionary deployments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/generic/story_generic.jsp?channel=aerospacedaily&amp;id=news/C17090308.xml&amp;headline=C-17%20In%20Contention%20For%20South%20Korean%20Transport |title= C-17 In Contention For South Korean Transport |last= Perrett |first= Bradley |date= 3 September 2008 |publisher=Aviation Week |accessdate=24 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2010, Kuwait requested the purchase of one C-17, spare parts and support through the U.S.'s [[Foreign Military Sales]] (FMS) program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dsca.mil/PressReleases/36-b/2010/Kuwait_10-51.pdf &quot;Kuwait C-17 Globemaster III Aircraft and Related Support&quot;]. U.S. Defense Security Cooperation Agency, 24 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2011, Australia's Minister for Defence [[Stephen Smith (Australian politician)|Stephen Smith]] announced that the nation had sent a Letter of Request to the United States about the possible purchase of a fifth C-17.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.minister.defence.gov.au/Smithtpl.cfm?CurrentId=11534 |title=C-17A Globemaster III Letter of Request |publisher=Australian Department of Defence |date=1 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Australia ordered its fifth C-17 through the FMS program on 18 April 2011, due to an increased demand for humanitarian and disaster relief missions. Due to urgent requirements, the RAAF will receive an aircraft in August originally slated for the USAF.&lt;ref&gt;[http://boeing.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=43&amp;item=1709 &quot;Boeing, Australia Announce Order for 5th C-17 Globemaster III&quot;] ''Boeing Press Release'' 18 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Production===
Due to a lack of sufficient orders, Boeing will deliver 13 C-17 Globemaster III airlifters in 2011. The company is transitioning to a lower production rate of 10 C-17s per year from a high of 16 per year in a bid to extend the production line through 2012 as it works to sign additional international orders. The C-17 production line was previously slated to be closed several times, but was extended due to new orders received.&lt;ref&gt;[http://boeing.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=43&amp;item=1588 &quot;Boeing C-17 Program Enters 2nd Phase of Production Rate and Work Force Reductions&quot;] ''Boeing Press Release'' 20 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The C-17 work force will be reduced by approximately 1,100 through the end of 2012, mostly through the elimination of a second shift at the C-17 final assembly facility in Long Beach.

There have been 230 production C-17s delivered, including 210 to the USAF.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2011/04/19/355726/australia-to-get-fifth-c-17-in-august.html &quot;Australia to get fifth C-17 in August&quot;] By Craig Hoyle, Flightglobal. 19 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt; This does not include the &quot;T-1&quot; prototype test aircraft, which is still used by the USAF for testing and development.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edwards.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123090905 &quot;Edwards T-1 reaches 1,000 flight milestone&quot;] by Senior Airman Stacy Sanchez, 95th Air Base Wing Public Affairs. 20 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

====Commercial interest====
In the mid-1990s, McDonnell Douglas began to market the C-17 to commercial civilian operators, under the name ''MD-17''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.boeing.com/news/releases/1997/news_release_970828n.html |title = MD-17 Receives FAA Certification |publisher = Boeing |date = 28 August 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to its high projected fuel, maintenance and depreciation cost for a low-cycle military design in commercial service, as well as a limited market dominated by the [[Antonov An-124|An-124]], very little interest was expressed. After McDonnell Douglas merged with Boeing, the commercial version was renamed ''BC-17''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.boeing.com/news/releases/2000/news_release_000928a.html |title = Boeing proposes BC-17X |publisher = Boeing |date = 28 September 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the aircraft received no orders and Boeing stopped offering the [[Commercial Application of Military Airlift Aircraft|BC-17 for sale]].

* On 10 September 1998, a U.S. Air Force C-17 (AF Serial No.''96-0006'') suffered a landing gear failure as it landed in Vestmannaeyjar, Iceland, a {{convert|3800|ft|m|adj=on}} runway, to deliver [[Keiko (orca)|Keiko]] the whale. After receiving temporary repairs, it was flown to another city in Iceland for further repairs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mcchordairmuseum.org/REV%20B%20OUR%20HISTORY%20%20NAME%20C-17%2096-0006%20SP%20OF%20BERLIN.htm C-17A S/N 96-0006]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_6712/is_24_203/ai_n28736153/ &quot;C-17 Accident During Whale Lift Due To Design Flaw&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; The total repair bill topped $1 million.

* On 6 August 2005, a U.S. Air Force C-17 (AF Serial No. ''01-0196'') ran off the runway at Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan while attempting to land, destroying the airplane's nose and main landing gear. At the time, it was the most extensively damaged C-17 to date.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defendamerica.mil/articles/aug2005/a080905wm5.html Bagram Runway Reopens After C-17 Incident  – DefendAmerica News Article]&lt;/ref&gt; A Boeing recovery team spent two months getting the aircraft ready to fly back to Boeing's Long Beach production facility.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boeing.com/news/frontiers/archive/2006/february/i_ids1.html &quot;The Big Fix&quot;], Boeing Frontiers Online, February 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The five-day flight back to the United States had to be performed by a [[test pilot]] because the temporary repairs caused numerous performance limitations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skypark.org/PilotsHonored.htm Skypark Pilots Honored], skypark.org&lt;/ref&gt; The repair was completed at Long Beach in October 2006 and the aircraft returned to service.

* On 30 January 2009, a U.S. Air Force C-17 (AF Serial No. ''96-0002'' – &quot;Spirit of the Air Force&quot;) made a gear-up [[belly landing]] at [[Bagram Air Base]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123133880 &quot;Bagram Air Base runway recovery&quot;].

U.S. Air Force, 7 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; By late April 2009, the C-17 was ferried from Bagram AB to Nova Scotia for an overnight stay after making several stops along the way.

In [[computer science]], '''garbage collection''' ('''GC''') is a form of automatic [[memory management]]. It is a special case of ''resource management'', in which the limited resource being managed is memory. The ''garbage collector'', or just ''collector'', attempts to reclaim ''[[garbage (computer science)|garbage]]'', or memory occupied by [[object (computer science)|objects]] that are no longer in use by the [[application software|program]]. Garbage collection was invented by [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]] around 1959 to solve problems in [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=367177.367199 |title=Recursive functions of symbolic expressions and their computation by machine |publisher=Portal.acm.org |date= |accessdate=2009-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/recursive.html|title=Recursive functions of symbolic expressions and their computation by machine, Part I|accessdate=2009-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Garbage collection is often portrayed as the opposite of [[manual memory management]], which requires the programmer to specify which objects to deallocate and return to the memory system. However, many systems use a combination of the two approaches, and other techniques such as stack allocation and [[region inference]] can carve off parts of the problem. There is an ambiguity of terms, as theory often uses the terms ''manual garbage collection'' and ''automatic garbage collection'' rather than ''manual memory management'' and ''garbage collection'', and does not restrict garbage collection to memory management, rather considering that any logical or physical [[resource (computer science)|resource]] may be garbage collected.

Garbage collection does not traditionally manage limited resources other than memory that typical programs use, such as network sockets, database handles, user interaction windows, and file and device descriptors. Methods used to manage such resources, particularly [[destructor (computer science)|destructors]], may suffice as well to manage memory, leaving no need for GC. Some GC systems allow such other resources to be associated with a region of memory that, when collected, causes the other resource to be reclaimed; this is called [[finalizer|''finalization'']]. Finalization may introduce complications limiting its usability, such as intolerable latency between disuse and reclaim of especially limited resources, or a lack of control over which thread performs the work of reclaiming.

== Principles ==

The basic principles of garbage collection are:

# Find data objects in a program that cannot be accessed in the future
# Reclaim the resources used by those objects

By making manual memory deallocation unnecessary (and often forbidding it), garbage collection frees the programmer from much of the worry about releasing objects that are no longer needed, which can otherwise consume substantial design effort. It also prevents some kinds of runtime errors.

Many [[programming language|computer language]]s require garbage collection, either as part of the language specification (e.g., [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]], and most [[scripting language]]s) or effectively for practical implementation (e.g., formal languages like [[lambda calculus]]); these are said to be '''garbage collected languages'''. Other languages were designed for use with manual memory management, but have garbage collected implementations available (e.g., [[C (programming language)|C]], [[C++]]). Some languages, like [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]], [[Modula-3]], and [[C++/CLI]] allow both garbage collection and [[manual memory management]] to co-exist in the same application by using separate [[Heap (data structure)|heaps]] for collected and manually managed objects; others, like [[D (programming language)|D]], are garbage collected but allow the user to manually delete objects and also entirely disable garbage collection when speed is required. While integrating garbage collection into the language's [[compiler]] and [[run time system|runtime]] system enables a much wider choice of methods,{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} ''post hoc'' GC systems exist, including some that do not require recompilation. (''Post-hoc'' GC is sometimes distinguished as ''litter collection''.) The garbage collector will almost always be closely integrated with the [[dynamic memory allocation|memory allocator]].

=== Benefits ===

Garbage collection frees the programmer from manually dealing with memory deallocation. As a result, certain categories of bugs are eliminated or substantially reduced:

* '''Dangling pointer bugs''', which occur when a piece of memory is freed while there are still pointers to it, and one of those pointers is then used. By then the memory may have been re-assigned to another use, with unpredictable results.
* '''Double free bugs''', which occur when the program tries to free a region of memory that has already been freed, and perhaps already been allocated again.
* Certain kinds of '''[[memory leak]]s''', in which a program fails to free memory occupied by objects that will not be used again, leading, over time, to memory exhaustion.

Some of these bugs can have security implications.

=== Disadvantages ===

Typically, garbage collection has certain disadvantages:

* Garbage collection consumes computing resources in deciding which memory to free, reconstructing facts that may have been known to the programmer. The penalty for the convenience of not annotating object lifetime manually in the source code is [[computational overhead|overhead]], often leading to decreased or uneven performance. Interaction with memory hierarchy effects can make this overhead intolerable in circumstances that are hard to predict or to detect in routine testing.
* The moment when the garbage is actually collected can be unpredictable, resulting in stalls scattered throughout a session. Unpredictable stalls can be unacceptable in [[real-time computing|real-time environments]] such as [[device driver]]s, in [[transaction processing]], or in interactive programs. This unpredictability also means that techniques such as [[RAII]], which allows for automatic cleaning up of resources (e.g. closing file handles, deleting temporary files, etc.), cannot be used, since the cleanup might happen too late. See the [[#Determinism|Determinism section]] for a detailed discussion.
* Memory may leak despite the presence of a garbage collector, if references to unused objects are not themselves manually disposed of. This is described as a ''logical'' memory leak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.virginia.edu/woda2004/papers/maebe.pdf |title=Maebe, Ronsse, and De Bosschere, &quot;Precise detection of memory leaks.&quot; |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[recursion (computer science)|recursive]] algorithms normally delay release of [[stack (data structure)|stack]] objects until after the final call has completed. [[Cache|Caching]] and [[memoizing]], common optimization techniques, commonly lead to such logical leaks. The belief that garbage collection eliminates all leaks leads many programmers not to guard against creating such leaks.
* In [[virtual memory]] environments typical of modern desktop computers, it can be difficult for the garbage collector to notice when collection is needed, resulting in large amounts of accumulated garbage, a long, disruptive collection phase, and other programs' data being swapped out.
* Programs that rely on garbage collectors often exhibit poor [[locality of reference|locality]] (interacting badly with cache and virtual memory systems), occupy more address space than the program actually uses at any one time, and touch otherwise idle pages. These may combine in a phenomenon called [[thrashing (computer science)|thrashing]], in which a program spends more time copying data between various grades of storage than performing useful work. They may make it impossible for a programmer to reason about the performance effects of design choices, making performance tuning difficult. They can lead garbage-collecting programs to interfere with other programs competing for resources.

== Tracing garbage collectors ==

Tracing garbage collectors are the most common type of garbage collector. They first determine which objects are ''reachable'' (or potentially reachable), and then discard all remaining objects.

=== Reachability of an object ===

Informally, a reachable object can be defined as an object for which there exists some variable in the program environment that leads to it, either directly or through references from other reachable objects. More precisely, objects can be reachable in only two ways:

# A distinguished set of objects are assumed to be reachable: these are known as the ''roots.'' Typically, these include all the objects referenced from anywhere in the [[call stack]] (that is, all local variables and parameters in the functions currently being invoked), and any global variables.
# Anything referenced from a reachable object is itself reachable; more formally, reachability is a [[transitive closure]].

The reachability definition of &quot;garbage&quot; is not optimal, insofar as the last time a program uses an object could be long before that object falls out of the environment scope. A distinction is sometimes drawn between ''syntactic garbage'', those objects the program cannot possibly reach, and ''semantic garbage'', those objects the program will in fact never again use. For example:
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
Object x = new Foo();
Object y = new Bar();
x = new Quux();
/* at this point, we know that the Foo object will
 * never be accessed: it is syntactic garbage
 */

if(x.check_something()) {
 x.do_something(y);
}
System.exit(0);
/* in the above block, y *could* be semantic garbage,
 * but we won't know until x.check_something() returns
 * some value: if it returns at all
 */
&lt;/source&gt;

The problem of precisely identifying semantic garbage can easily be shown to be [[decision problem|partially decidable]]: a program that allocates an object ''X'', runs an arbitrary input program ''P'', and uses ''X'' if and only if ''P'' finishes would require a semantic garbage collector to solve the [[halting problem]]. Although conservative heuristic methods for semantic garbage detection remain an active research area, essentially all practical garbage collectors focus on syntactic garbage.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

Another complication with this approach is that, in languages with both [[reference type]]s and unboxed [[value type]]s, the garbage collector needs to somehow be able to distinguish which variables on the stack or fields in an object are regular values and which are references: in memory, an integer and a reference might look alike. The garbage collector then needs to know whether to treat the element as a reference and follow it, or whether it is a primitive value. One common solution is the use of [[tagged pointer]]s.

=== Strong and weak references ===

The garbage collector can reclaim only objects that have no references. An object that is reachable cannot be garbage collected by the garbage collector. Such a reference is known as a [[strong reference]]. An object can also be referred to as a [[weak reference]], also known as the target. An object is eligible for garbage collection if it does not contain any strong references, irrespective of the number of weak references it contains. There are two types of weak references; a long weak reference tracks resurrection while a short weak reference does not. The primary advantage of maintaining weak references to an object is that it allows the garbage collector to collect or reclaim memory of the object if it runs out of memory in the managed heap.

=== Basic algorithm ===

Tracing collectors are so called because they trace through the working set of memory. These garbage collectors perform collection in cycles. A cycle is started when the collector decides (or is notified) that it needs to reclaim memory, which happens most often when the system is low on memory. The original method involves a naïve '''mark-and-sweep''' in which the entire memory set is touched several times.

==== Naïve mark-and-sweep ====

In the naïve mark-and-sweep method, each object in memory has a flag (typically a single bit) reserved for garbage collection use only. This flag is always ''cleared'', except during the collection cycle. The first stage of collection sweeps the entire 'root set', marking each accessible object as being 'in-use'. All objects transitively accessible from the root set are marked, as well. Finally, each object in memory is again examined; those with the in-use flag still cleared are not reachable by any program or data, and their memory is freed. (For objects which are marked in-use, the in-use flag is cleared again, preparing for the next cycle.)

This method has several disadvantages, the most notable being that the entire system must be suspended during collection; no mutation of the working set can be allowed. This will cause programs to 'freeze' periodically (and generally unpredictably), making real-time and time-critical applications impossible. In addition, the entire working memory must be examined, much of it twice, potentially causing problems in [[paged memory]] systems.

==== Tri-colour marking ====

Because of these pitfalls, most modern tracing garbage collectors implement some variant of the ''tri-colour marking'' [[abstraction (computer science)|abstraction]], but simple collectors (such as the ''mark-and-sweep'' collector) often do not make this abstraction explicit.
Tri-colour marking works as follows:

# Create initial white, grey, and black sets; these sets will be used to maintain progress during the cycle.
#* Initially the white set or ''condemned set'' is the set of objects that are candidates for having their memory recycled.
#* The black set is the set of objects that cheaply can be proven to have no references to objects in the white set; in many implementations the black set starts off empty.
#* The grey set is all the objects that are reachable from root references but the objects referenced by grey objects haven't been scanned yet. Grey objects are known to be reachable from the root, so cannot be garbage collected: grey objects will eventually end up in the black set. The grey state means we still need to check any objects that the object references.
#* The grey set is initialised to objects which are referenced directly at root level; typically all other objects are initially placed in the white set.
#* Objects can move from white to grey to black, never in the other direction.
# Pick an object from the grey set. ''Blacken'' this object (move it to the black set), by ''greying'' all the white objects it references directly. This confirms that this object cannot be garbage collected, and also that any objects it references cannot be garbage collected.
# Repeat the previous step until the grey set is empty.
# When there are no more objects in the grey set, then all the objects remaining in the white set have been demonstrated not to be reachable, and the storage occupied by them can be reclaimed.

The 3 sets [[partition of a set|partition]] memory; every object in the system, including the root set, is in precisely one set.

The tri-colour marking algorithm preserves an important invariant:
:No black object points directly to a white object.
This ensures that the white objects can be safely destroyed once the grey set is empty. (Some variations on the algorithm do not preserve the tricolour invariant but they use a modified form for which all the important properties hold.)

The tri-colour method has an important advantage: it can be performed 'on-the-fly', without halting the system for significant time periods. This is accomplished by marking objects as they are allocated and during mutation, maintaining the various sets. By monitoring the size of the sets, the system can perform garbage collection periodically, rather than as-needed. Also, the need to touch the entire working set each cycle is avoided.

=== Implementation strategies ===

In order to implement the basic tri-colour algorithm, several important design decisions must be made, which can significantly affect the performance characteristics of the garbage collector.

==== Moving vs. non-moving ====

Once the unreachable set has been determined, the garbage collector may simply release the [[unreachable object]]s and leave everything else as it is, or it may copy some or all of the reachable objects into a new area of memory, updating all references to those objects as needed. These are called &quot;non-moving&quot; and &quot;moving&quot; garbage collectors, respectively.

At first, a moving GC strategy may seem inefficient and costly compared to the non-moving approach, since much more work would appear to be required on each cycle. In fact, however, the moving GC strategy leads to several performance advantages, both during the garbage collection cycle itself and during actual program execution:
* No additional work is required to reclaim the space freed by dead objects; the entire region of memory from which reachable objects were moved can be considered free space. In contrast, a non-moving GC must visit each unreachable object and somehow record that the memory it alone occupied is available.
* Similarly, new objects can be allocated very quickly. Since large contiguous regions of memory are usually made available by the moving GC strategy, new objects can be allocated by simply incrementing a 'free memory' pointer. A non-moving strategy may, after some time, lead to a heavily [[fragmentation (computer)|fragmented]] heap, requiring expensive consultation of &quot;free lists&quot; of small available blocks of memory in order to allocate new objects.
* If an appropriate traversal order is used (such as cdr-first for list [[cons]]es), objects that refer to each other frequently can be moved very close to each other in memory, increasing the likelihood that they will be located in the same [[cache line]] or [[virtual memory]] page. This can significantly speed up access to these objects through these references.

One disadvantage of a moving garbage collector is that it only allows access through references that are managed by the garbage collected environment, and does not allow [[pointer (computing)|pointer arithmetic]]. This is because any native pointers to objects will be invalidated when the garbage collector moves the object (they become [[dangling pointer]]s). For [[interoperability]] with native code, the garbage collector must copy the object contents to a location outside of the garbage collected region of memory. An alternative approach is to '''pin''' the object in memory, preventing the garbage collector from moving it and allowing the memory to be directly shared with native pointers (and possibly allowing pointer arithmetic).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/23acw07k.aspx |title=Copying and Pinning |publisher=Msdn2.microsoft.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Copying vs. mark-and-sweep vs. mark-and-don't-sweep ====

To further refine the distinction, tracing collectors can also be divided by considering how the three sets of objects (white, grey, and black) are maintained during a collection cycle.

The most straightforward approach is the '''semi-space collector''', which dates to 1969. In this moving GC scheme, memory is partitioned into a &quot;from space&quot; and &quot;to space&quot;. Initially, objects are allocated into &quot;to space&quot; until they become full and a collection is triggered. At the start of a collection, the &quot;to space&quot; becomes the &quot;from space&quot;, and vice versa. The objects reachable from the root set are copied from the &quot;from space&quot; to the &quot;to space&quot;. These objects are scanned in turn, and all objects that they point to are copied into &quot;to space&quot;, until all reachable objects have been copied into &quot;to space&quot;. Once the program continues execution, new objects are once again allocated in the &quot;to space&quot; until it is once again full and the process is repeated. This approach has the advantage of conceptual simplicity (the three object color sets are implicitly constructed during the copying process), but the disadvantage that a (possibly) very large contiguous region of free memory is necessarily required on every collection cycle. This technique is also known as '''stop-and-copy'''. [[Cheney's algorithm]] is an improvement on the semi-space collector.

A '''mark and sweep''' garbage collector maintains a bit (or two) with each object to record whether it is white or black; the grey set is either maintained as a separate list (such as the process stack) or using another bit. As the reference tree is traversed during a collection cycle (the &quot;mark&quot; phase), these bits are manipulated by the collector to reflect the current state. A final &quot;sweep&quot; of the memory areas then frees white objects. The mark and sweep strategy has the advantage that, once the unreachable set is determined, either a moving or non-moving collection strategy can be pursued; this choice of strategy can even be made at runtime, as available memory permits. It has the disadvantage of &quot;bloating&quot; objects by a small amount.

A '''mark and don't sweep''' garbage collector, like the mark-and-sweep, maintains a bit with each object to record whether it is white or black; the gray set is either maintained as a separate list (such as the process stack) or using another bit. There are two key differences here. First, black and white mean different things than they do in the mark and sweep collector. In a &quot;mark and don't sweep&quot; system, all reachable objects are always black. An object is marked black at the time it is allocated, and it will stay black even if it becomes unreachable. A white object is unused memory and may be allocated. Second, the interpretation of the black/white bit can change. Initially, the black/white bit may have the sense of (0=white, 1=black). If an allocation operation ever fails to find any available (white) memory, that means all objects are marked used (black). The sense of the black/white bit is then inverted (for example, 0=black, 1=white). Everything becomes white. This momentarily breaks the invariant that reachable objects are black, but a full marking phase follows immediately, to mark them black again. Once this is done, all unreachable memory is white. No &quot;sweep&quot; phase is necessary.

==== Generational GC (ephemeral GC) ====

It has been empirically observed that in many programs, the most recently created objects are also those most likely to become unreachable quickly (known as ''infant mortality'' or the ''generational hypothesis''). &lt;!--
the following sentence is embarrassing without a reference, someone please find one

Experimental evidence shows that around 90% of objects die before their first garbage collection. --&gt; A generational GC (also known as ephemeral GC) divides objects into generations and, on most cycles, will place only the objects of a subset of generations into the initial white (condemned) set. Furthermore, the runtime system maintains knowledge of when references cross generations by observing the creation and overwriting of references. When the garbage collector runs, it may be able to use this knowledge to prove that some objects in the initial white set are unreachable without having to traverse the entire reference tree. If the generational hypothesis holds, this results in much faster collection cycles while still reclaiming most unreachable objects.

In order to implement this concept, many generational garbage collectors use separate memory regions for different ages of objects. When a region becomes full, those few objects that are referenced from older memory regions are promoted (copied) up to the next highest region, and the entire region can then be overwritten with fresh objects. This technique permits very fast incremental garbage collection, since the garbage collection of only one region at a time is all that is typically required.

Generational garbage collection is a [[heuristic (computer science)|heuristic]] approach, and some unreachable objects may not be reclaimed on each cycle. It may therefore occasionally be necessary to perform a full mark and sweep or copying garbage collection to reclaim all available space. In fact, runtime systems for modern programming languages (such as [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and the [[.NET Framework]]) usually use some hybrid of the various strategies that have been described thus far; for example, most collection cycles might look only at a few generations, while occasionally a mark-and-sweep is performed, and even more rarely a full copying is performed to combat fragmentation. The terms &quot;minor cycle&quot; and &quot;major cycle&quot; are sometimes used to describe these different levels of collector aggression.

==== Stop-the-world vs. incremental vs. concurrent ====

Simple ''stop-the-world'' garbage collectors completely halt execution of the program to run a collection cycle, thus guaranteeing that new objects are not allocated and objects do not suddenly become unreachable while the collector is running.

This has the obvious disadvantage that the program can perform no useful work while a collection cycle is running (sometimes called the &quot;embarrassing pause&quot;). Stop-the-world garbage collection is therefore mainly suitable for non-interactive programs. Its advantage is that it is both simpler to implement and faster than incremental garbage collection.

''Incremental'' and ''concurrent'' garbage collectors are designed to reduce this disruption by interleaving their work with activity from the main program. Incremental garbage collectors perform the garbage collection cycle in discrete phases, with program execution permitted between each phase (and sometimes during some phases). Concurrent garbage collectors do not stop program execution at all, except perhaps briefly when the program's execution stack is scanned. However, the sum of the incremental phases takes longer to complete than one batch garbage collection pass, so these garbage collectors may yield lower total throughput.

Careful design is necessary with these techniques to ensure that the main program does not interfere with the garbage collector and vice versa; for example, when the program needs to allocate a new object, the runtime system may either need to suspend it until the collection cycle is complete, or somehow notify the garbage collector that there exists a new, reachable object.

==== Precise vs. conservative and internal pointers ====

Some collectors can correctly identify all pointers (references) in an object; these are called ''precise'' (also ''exact'' or ''accurate'') collectors, the opposite being a ''conservative'' or ''partly conservative'' collector. Conservative collectors assume that any bit pattern in memory could be a pointer if, interpreted as a pointer, it would point into an allocated object. Conservative collectors may produce false positives, where unused memory is not released because of improper pointer identification. This is not always a problem in practice unless the program handles a lot of data that could easily be misidentified as a pointer. False positives are generally less problematic on 64-bit systems than on 32-bit systems because the range of valid memory addresses tends to be a tiny fraction of the range of 64-bit values. Thus, an arbitrary 64-bit pattern is unlikely to mimic a valid pointer. Whether a precise collector is practical usually depends on the type safety properties of the programming language in question. An example for which a conservative garbage collector would be needed is the [[C (programming language)|C language]], which allows typed (non-void) pointers to be type cast into untyped (void) pointers, and vice versa.

A related issue concerns ''internal pointers'', or pointers to fields within an object. If the semantics of a language allow internal pointers, then there may be many different addresses that can refer to parts of the same object, which complicates determining whether an object is garbage or not. An example for this is the [[C++]] language, in which multiple inheritance can cause pointers to base objects to have different addresses. Even in languages like [[Java (programming language)|Java]], internal pointers can exist during the computation of, say, an array element address. In a tightly-optimized program, the corresponding pointer to the object itself may have been overwritten in its register, so such internal pointers need to be scanned.

=== Performance implications ===

Tracing garbage collectors require some implicit runtime [[computational overhead|overhead]] that may be beyond the control of the programmer, and can sometimes lead to performance problems. For example, commonly used stop-the-world garbage collectors, which pause program execution at arbitrary times, may make garbage collection inappropriate for some [[embedded system]]s, high-performance [[server (computing)|server]] software, and applications with [[real-time computing|real-time]] needs.

; Manual heap allocation:
* search for best/first-fit block of sufficient size
* free list maintenance

; Garbage collection:
* locate reachable objects
* copy reachable objects for moving collectors
* read/write barriers for incremental collectors
* search for best/first-fit block and free list maintenance for non-moving collectors

It is difficult to compare the two cases directly, as their behavior depends on the situation. For example, in the best case for a garbage collecting system, allocation just increments a pointer, but in the best case for manual heap allocation, the allocator maintains freelists of specific sizes and allocation only requires following a pointer. However, this size segregation usually cause a large degree of external fragmentation, which can have an adverse impact on cache behaviour. Memory allocation in a garbage collected language may be implemented using heap allocation behind the scenes (rather than simply incrementing a pointer), so the performance advantages listed above don't necessarily apply in this case. In some situations, most notably [[embedded system]]s, it is possible to avoid both garbage collection and heap management overhead by preallocating pools of memory and using a custom, lightweight scheme for allocation/deallocation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eros-os.org/pipermail/cap-talk/2007-January/006795.html |title=Memory allocation in embedded systems |publisher=Eros-os.org |date= |accessdate=2009-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The overhead of write barriers is more likely to be noticeable in an [[imperative programming|imperative]]-style program which frequently writes pointers into existing data structures than in a [[functional programming|functional]]-style program which constructs data only once and never changes them.

Some advances in garbage collection can be understood as reactions to performance issues. Early collectors were stop-the-world collectors, but the performance of this approach was distracting in interactive applications. Incremental collection avoided this disruption, but at the cost of decreased efficiency due to the need for barriers. Generational collection techniques are used with both stop-the-world and incremental collectors to increase performance; the trade-off is that some garbage is not detected as such for longer than normal.

=== Determinism ===

Tracing garbage collection is not [[deterministic algorithm|deterministic]]. An object which becomes eligible for garbage collection will usually be cleaned up eventually, but there is no guarantee when (or even if) that will happen.

This can cause problems:
* Most environments with tracing GC require manual deallocation of limited non-memory resources, as an automatic deallocation during the garbage collection phase (usually using a [[finalizer]]) may run too late or in the wrong circumstances.
* The performance impact caused by GC is seemingly random and hard to predict.

== Reference counting ==
{{Main|Reference counting}}

Reference counting is a form of automatic memory management where each object has a count of the number of references to it. An object's reference count is incremented when a reference to it is created, and decremented when a reference is destroyed. The object's memory is reclaimed when the count reaches zero.

There are two major disadvantages to reference counting:

* If two or more objects refer to each other, they can create a cycle whereby neither will be collected as their mutual references never let their reference counts become zero. Some garbage collection systems using reference counting (like the one in [[CPython]]) use specific cycle-detecting algorithms to deal with this issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.python.org/doc/2.5.2/ext/refcounts.html|accessdate=2008-11-13|date=2008-02-21|title=Reference Counts|work=Extending and Embedding the Python Interpreter|quote=While Python uses the traditional reference counting implementation, it also offers a cycle detector that works to detect reference cycles.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In naive implementations, each assignment of a reference and each reference falling out of scope often require modifications of one or more reference counters. However, optimizations to this are [[reference counting#Dealing with inefficiency of updates|described in the literature]].{{Clarify|date=September 2008}} When used in a [[thread (computing)|multithreaded]] environment, these modifications (increment and decrement) may need to be interlocked. This may be an expensive operation for processors without atomic operations such as [[compare-and-swap]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

One important advantage of reference counting is that it provides deterministic garbage collection (as opposed to tracing GC).

== Escape analysis ==
{{Main|Escape analysis}}

[[Escape analysis]] can be used to convert heap allocations to stack allocations, thus reducing the amount of work needed to be done by the garbage collector.

== Availability ==

Generally speaking, [[high-level programming language|higher-level programming languages]] are more likely to have garbage collection as a standard feature. In languages that do not have built in garbage collection, it can often be added through a library, as with the [[Boehm garbage collector]] for C and C++. This approach is not without drawbacks, such as changing object creation and destruction mechanisms.

Most [[functional programming language]]s, such as [[ML (programming language)|ML]], [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]], and [[APL (programming language)|APL]], have garbage collection built in. [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]], which introduced [[functional programming]], is especially notable for introducing this mechanism.

Other dynamic languages, such as [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]] (but not [[Perl]] 5, or [[PHP]], which use reference counting), also tend to use GC. [[Object-oriented programming]] languages such as [[Smalltalk]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and [[ECMAScript]] usually provide integrated garbage collection. Notable exceptions are [[C++]] and [[Embarcadero Delphi|Delphi]] which have [[destructor (computer science)|destructors]]. [[Objective-C]] has not traditionally had it, but ObjC 2.0 as implemented by Apple for [[Mac OS X]] uses a runtime collector developed in-house, while the [[GNUstep]] project uses a Boehm collector.

Historically, languages intended for beginners, such as [[BASIC]] and [[Logo (programming language)|Logo]], have often used garbage collection for variable-length data types, such as strings and lists, so as not to burden programmers with manual memory management. On early microcomputers, with their limited memory and slow processors, BASIC garbage collection could often cause apparently random, inexplicable pauses in the midst of program operation.

== Limited environments ==

Garbage collection is rarely used on embedded or real-time systems because of the perceived need for very tight control over the use of limited resources. However, garbage collectors compatible with such limited environments have been developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=1140392&amp;type=pdf&amp;coll=GUIDE&amp;dl=GUIDE&amp;CFID=15151515&amp;CFTOKEN=6184618 |title=Wei Fu and Carl Hauser, &quot;A Real-Time Garbage Collection Framework for Embedded Systems&quot;. ACM SCOPES '05, 2005 |publisher=Portal.acm.org |date= |accessdate=2010-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Microsoft [[.NET Micro Framework]] and [[Java Platform, Micro Edition]] are embedded software platforms that, like their larger cousins, include garbage collection.

'''Canidae''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|k|æ|n|ɨ|d|iː}})
&lt;ref&gt;Canidae. Dictionary.com. The American Heritage Stedman's Medical Dictionary. Houghton Mifflin Company. http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Canidae (accessed: February 16, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;
is the [[family (biology)|biological family]] of [[carnivorous]] and [[omnivorous]] [[mammals]] that includes the [[wolf|wolves]], [[fox]]es, [[jackal]]s, [[coyote]]s, and the domestic [[dog]]; a member of this family is called a '''canid''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|eɪ|n|ɨ|d}}). The Canidae family is divided into the &quot;wolf-like&quot; and &quot;dog-like&quot; animals of the tribe Canini and the &quot;foxes&quot; of the tribe Vulpini. The two species of the basal Caninae are more primitive and do not fit into either tribe.

==Classification and relationship==
The subdivision of Canidae into &quot;foxes&quot; and &quot;true dogs&quot; may not be in accordance with the actual relations; also the [[alpha taxonomy|taxonomic]] classification of several canines is disputed. Recent [[DNA]] analysis shows that Canini (dogs) and Vulpini (foxes) are valid [[cladistics|clades]]. (See phylogeny below). Molecular data implies a North American origin of living Canidae and an African origin of wolf-like canines (''Canis'', ''Cuon'', and ''Lycaon'').&lt;ref name=Lindblad-toh2005&gt;{{cite journal | author = Lindblad-toh, K. | year = 2005 | title = Genome sequence, comparative analysis and haplotype structure of the domestic dog | journal = Nature | volume = 438 | issue = 7069 | pages = 803–819 | url = http://ccr.cancer.gov/resources/cop/nature04338.pdf | format=PDF | accessdate = 2008-04-27 | doi = 10.1038/nature04338 | pmid = 16341006 | last2 = Wade | first2 = CM | last3 = Mikkelsen | first3 = TS | last4 = Karlsson | first4 = EK | last5 = Jaffe | first5 = DB | last6 = Kamal | first6 = M | last7 = Clamp | first7 = M | last8 = Chang | first8 = JL | last9 = Kulbokas Ej | first9 = 3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, the [[dog|domestic dog]] is listed as a [[Subspecies of Canis lupus|subspecies of ''Canis lupus'']], ''C. l. familiaris'', and the [[Dingo]] (also considered a domestic dog) as ''C. l. dingo'', provisionally a separate subspecies from ''C. l. familiaris''; the [[Red Wolf]], [[Eastern Canadian Wolf]], and [[Indian Wolf]] are recognized as [[subspecies]].&lt;ref name=msw3/&gt; Many sources list the domestic dog as ''Canis familiaris'', but others, including the [[Smithsonian Institution]] and the [[American Society of Mammalogists]], more precisely list it as a subspecies of ''C. l. familiaris''; the Red Wolf, Eastern Canadian Wolf, and Indian Wolf may or may not be separate [[species]]; the [[Dingo]] has been in the past variously classified as ''Canis dingo'', ''Canis familiaris dingo'' and ''Canis lupus familiaris dingo''.

==Evolution==
{{clear-right}}
{{include timeline}}

===Eocene epoch===
[[Carnivorans]] evolved from [[miacoids]] about 55 million years ago during the late [[Paleocene]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://paleodb.org/cgi-bin/bridge.pl?action=checkTaxonInfo&amp;taxon_no=57534&amp;is_real_user=1]&lt;/ref&gt; Then, about 50 million years ago, the carnivorans split into two main divisions: [[caniforms]] (dog-like) and [[feliforms]] (cat-like). By 40 million years ago the first clearly identifiable member of the dog family Canidae had arisen. It was called ''[[Prohesperocyon wilsoni]]'' and was found in what is now southwestern Texas. This fossil species bears a combination of features that definitively mark it as a canid: teeth that include the loss of the upper third molar (a general trend toward a more shearing bite), and the characteristically enlarged bony [[bulla]] (the rounded covering over the middle ear). Based on what we know about its descendants, ''Prohesperocyon'' likely had slightly more elongated limbs than its predecessors, along with toes that were parallel and closely touching, rather than splayed, as in bears.&lt;ref name=Wang-Tedford&gt;{{cite journal| last = Wang| first = Xiaoming| year = 2008| title = How Dogs Came to Run the World| journal = Natural History Magazine| volume = July/August| url = http://www.naturalhistorymag.com/master.html?http://www.naturalhistorymag.com/0708/0708_feature.html| accessdate = 2008-11-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Canidae family soon subdivided into three subfamilies, each of which diverged during the Eocene: [[Hesperocyoninae]] (~39.74-15 Mya), [[Borophaginae]] (~34-2 Mya), and the [[Caninae]] (~34-0 Mya) lineage that led to present-day canids (wolves, foxes, coyotes, jackals, and domestic dogs). Each of these groups showed an [[cope's rule|increase in body mass with time]], and sometimes exhibited a specialised [[hypercarnivorous]] diet that made them prone to extinction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite doi|10.1126/science.1102417}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|Fig. 1}} Only the [[Caninae]] lineage, commonly referred to as &quot;canines&quot;, survived to the present day.

===Oligocene epoch===
The earliest branch of the Canidae was the Hesperocyoninae lineage, which included the coyote-sized ''[[Mesocyon]]'' of the Oligocene (38-24 Mya). These early canids probably evolved for fast pursuit of prey in a grassland habitat, and resembled modern [[civet]]s in appearance. Hesperocyonines became extinct except for the ''Nothocyon'' and ''Leptocyon'' branches. These branches led to the borophagine and canine radiations.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, L.D. 1989. Fossil history of the terrestrial carnivora. Pages 536 - 568 in J.L. Gittleman, editor. Carnivore Behavior, Ecology, and Evolution, Vol. 1. Comstock Publishing Associates: Ithaca.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Miocene epoch===
Around 9-10 Mya during the [[Late Miocene]], ''[[Canis]]'', ''[[Urocyon]]'', and ''[[Vulpes]]'' genera expanded from southwestern [[North America]]. This was the point where the canine radiation began. The success of these canines was related to the development of lower [[carnassial]]s that were capable of both [[mastication]] and shearing. Around 8 Mya, [[Beringia]] offered the canines a way to enter [[Eurasia]].

===Pliocene epoch===
During the [[Pliocene]] around (4-5 Mya) ''[[Johnston's Coyote|Canis lepophagus]]'' appeared in North America. This was small and sometimes coyote-like. Others were wolf-like in characteristics. It is theorized that ''Canis latrans'' (the coyote) descended from ''Canis lepophagus''.&lt;ref&gt;Nowak, R.M. 1979. North American Quaternary Canis. Monograph of the Museum of Natural History, University of Kansas 6:1 - 154.&lt;/ref&gt;

The formation of the [[Isthmus of Panama]] about 3 Mya joined [[South America]] to North America, allowing canids to [[Great American Interchange|invade the former]], where they diversified.

===Pleistocene epoch===
Around 1.5 to 1.8 Mya, a variety of wolves were present in Europe. Also, the North American wolf line appeared with ''[[Canis edwardii]]'', clearly identifiable as a wolf. ''[[Canis rufus]]'' appeared, possibly a direct descendent of ''Canis edwardii''. Around 0.8 Mya, ''[[Canis ambrusteri]]'' emerged in North America. A large wolf, it was found all over the continent. It is thought that this species migrated to South America where it became the ancestor of ''[[Canis dirus]]'', the dire wolf.

At 0.3 Mya ''[[Gray wolf|Canis lupus]]'' (the gray wolf) was fully developed and had spread throughout Europe and northern Asia. Beringia offered a way to North America.&lt;ref&gt;Nowak, R. 1992. Wolves: The great travelers of evolution. International Wolf 2(4):3 - 7.&lt;/ref&gt; At around 100,000 years ago, the dire wolf, one of the largest members of the dog family, had spread from South America to southern Canada and from coast to coast. The dire wolf shared its habitat with the gray wolf. Around 8,000 years ago the dire wolf became extinct.

==Characteristics==
Wild canids are found on every continent except Antarctica, and inhabit a wide range of different habitats, including [[deserts]], [[mountains]], [[forests]], and [[grassland]]. They vary in size from the [[Fennec Fox]] at {{convert|24|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, to the [[Gray Wolf]], which may be up to {{convert|2|m|ft|abbr=on }} long, and can weigh up to {{convert|80|kg|lb|abbr=on }}.

With the exceptions of the [[Bush Dog]], [[Raccoon Dog]] and some [[Dog breed|domestic breeds]], canids have relatively long legs and lithe bodies, adapted for chasing prey. All canids are [[digitigrade]], meaning that they walk on their toes. They possess bushy tails, non-retractile claws, and, excepting the [[African Wild Dog]] (''Lycaon pictus''), a [[dewclaw]] on the front feet. They possess a [[baculum]], which together with a cavernous body helps to create a copulatory tie during mating, locking the animals together for up to an hour. Young canids are born blind, with their eyes opening a few weeks after birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Macdonald, D.|year=1984 |title= The Encyclopedia of Mammals|publisher= Facts on File|location=New York|pages= 57|isbn= 0-87196-871-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social behavior===
Almost all canids are social animals and live together in groups. In most foxes and in many of the true dogs, a male and female pair work together to hunt and to raise their young. [[Gray wolves]] and some of the other larger canids live in larger groups called [[packs]]. [[African wild dog]]s have the largest packs, which can number as many as 90 animals. Some species form packs or live in small family groups depending on the circumstances, including the type of available food. In most species, there are also some individuals who live on their own. Within a canid pack, there is a system of dominance so that the strongest, most experienced animals lead the pack. In most cases, the dominant male and female are the only pack members to breed.

Canids communicate with each other by scent signals, by visual clues and gestures, and by vocalizations such as growls, barks, and howls. In most cases, groups have a home territory from which they drive out others. The territory is marked by leaving urine scent marks, which warn trespassing individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Nowak, R. M., and J. L. Paradiso. 1983. Walker's Mammals of the World. Baltimore, Maryland: The Johns Hopkins University Press. ISBN 0801825253.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most canids bear young once a year, from 1 to 16 or more (in the case of the African wild dog) at a time. The young are born small and helpless and require a long period of care. They are kept in a den, most often dug into the ground, for warmth and protection. When they begin eating solid food, both parents, and often other pack members, bring food back for them from the hunt. This is most often vomited up from the adult's stomach. Young canids may take a year to mature and learn the skills they need to survive.&lt;ref&gt;Voelker, W. 1986. The Natural History of Living Mammals. Medford, New Jersey: Plexus Publishing. ISBN 0937548081&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dentition===
[[File:Lupocranio.jpg|thumb|right|[[Italian wolf]] skull]] Most canids have 42 [[tooth|teeth]], with a [[dentition|dental formula]] of: {{DentalFormula|upper=3.1.4.2|lower=3.1.4.3}}. As in other members of [[Carnivora]], the upper fourth [[premolar]] and lower first [[Molar (tooth)|molar]] are adapted as [[carnassial]] teeth for slicing flesh. The molar teeth are strong in most species, allowing the animals to crack open bone to reach the [[bone marrow|marrow]]. The deciduous or baby teeth formula in canids is 3 1 3; molars are completely absent.

==Canids and humans==
[[Image:BedaleHunt2005.jpg|thumb|Traditional English [[fox hunt]]]]
One canid, the domestic dog, a subspecies of the Gray Wolf, long ago entered into a partnership with humans and today remains one of the most widely kept domestic animals in the world and serves humanity in a great many important ways.

Among canids, only the gray wolf has been known to prey on humans.&lt;ref&gt;Kruuk, H. 2002. Hunter and Hunted: Relationships between Carnivores and People. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press. ISBN 0521814103.&lt;/ref&gt; There are at least [[Coyote#Attacks_on_humans|two records]] of coyotes killing humans,&lt;ref name=&quot;AOH&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Coyote Attacks: An Increasing Suburban Problem | work = | publisher = | url = http://www.co.san-diego.ca.us/awm/docs/coyoteattacks.pdf | accessdate = 2007-08-19 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060224153601/http://www.co.san-diego.ca.us/awm/docs/coyoteattacks.pdf |archivedate = February 24, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and two of golden jackals killing children.&lt;ref name=&quot;CWC&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Canis aureus | work = | publisher = Animal Diversity Web | url = http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Canis_aureus.html | accessdate = 2007-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some canid species have also been trapped and hunted for their fur and, especially the Gray Wolf and the Red Fox, for sport. Some canids are now endangered in the wild due to hunting, habitat loss, and the introduction of diseases from domestic dogs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iucnredlist.org/ ICUN Red List]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Canis lupus''''' has 39 [[subspecies]] currently described, including two subspecies of domestic dog, [[Dingo|''Canis lupus dingo'']] and [[Dog|''Canis lupus familiaris'']], and many subspecies of [[wolf]] throughout the [[Northern hemisphere]]. The [[nominate subspecies]] is ''[[Canis lupus lupus]]''.

Canis lupus is assessed as [[Least Concern]] by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature|IUCN]], as its relatively widespread range and stable population trend mean that the species, at global level, does not meet, or nearly meet, any of the criteria for the [[Threatened species|threatened]] categories.&lt;ref name=&quot;iucn&quot;&gt;{{IUCN2006|assessors=Mech, L.D., Boitani, L. |year=2008 |id=3746 |title=Canis lupus |downloaded=2006-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biological [[Taxonomy of Life|taxonomy]] is not fixed, and placement of taxa is reviewed as a result of new research. The current categorization of subspecies of ''Canis lupus'' is shown below. Also included are synonyms, which are now discarded duplicate or incorrect namings. Common names are given but may vary, as they have no set meaning.

==Geographical variations==
Wolves show a great deal of [[dimorphism]] geographically, though they can interbreed. The Zoological Gardens of London for example once successfully managed to mate a male European wolf to an Indian female, resulting in a cub bearing an almost exact likeness to its sire.&lt;ref&gt;''The Living Age'', published by Littell, Son and Co., 1851&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===
European wolves tend to have coarse fur with less soft wool intermixed than American wolves. Their heads are narrower, their ears longer, higher placed and somewhat closer to each other. Their loins are more slender, their legs longer, their feet narrower, and their tails more thinly clothed with fur.&lt;ref name=&quot;rich1829&quot;/&gt; Pelt colour in European wolves ranges from white, cream, red, grey and black, sometimes with all colours combined. Wolves in central Europe tend to be more richly coloured than those in [[Northern Europe]]. Eastern European wolves tend to be shorter and more heavily built than Northern Russian ones.&lt;ref name=&quot;HAOAC&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author=  | title= Hutchinson's animals of all countries: the living animals of the world in picture and story. Volume I| year=1923 | id= | page= 384 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===North America===
North American wolves are generally the same size as European wolves, but have shorter legs, larger, rounder heads, broader, more obtuse muzzles, and a sensible depression at the union of nose and forehead, which is more arched and broad. Their ears are shorter and have a more conical form. They typically lack the black mark on the forelegs, as is the case in European races. They have long and comparatively fine fur, mixed with a shorter wooly hair, and are more robust.&lt;ref name=&quot;rich1829&quot;&gt;Richardson, J., Swainson, W., Kirby, W. (1829) ''Fauna Boreali-americana, Or, The Zoology of the Northern Parts of British America: Containing Descriptions of the Objects of Natural History Collected on the Late Northern Land Expeditions, Under Command of Captain Sir John Franklin, R.N.'' J. Murray, London [http://www.archive.org/details/faunaborealiamer01rich book preview]&lt;/ref&gt; Fur colour in American wolves ranges from white, black, red, yellow, brown, gray, and grizzled skins, and others representing every shade between, although usually each locality has its prevailing tint. There are pronounced differences in North American wolves of different localities; wolves from Texas and New Mexico are comparatively slim animals with small teeth.&lt;ref name=&quot;roos&quot;&gt;[http://www.fullbooks.com/Hunting-the-Grisly-and-Other-Sketches3.html Hunting the Grisly and Other Sketches by Theodore Roosevelt - Full Text Free Book (Part 3/3)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Mexican wolves in particular resemble some European wolves in stature, though their heads are usually broader, their necks thicker, their ears longer and their tails shorter.&lt;ref name=&quot;genera&quot;&gt;''The Natural History of Dogs: Canidæ Or Genus Canis of Authors.

London; and W. Curry, jun. and Co. Dublin., 1839&lt;/ref&gt; Wolves of the central and northern chains of the Rocky Mountains and coastal ranges are more formidable animals than the more southern plains wolves, and resemble Russian and Scandinavian wolves in size and proportions.&lt;ref name=&quot;roos&quot; /&gt;

=== Disputed subspecies and species ===
[[File:Lupo appenninico 3.jpg|thumb|Italian (Apennine) Wolf from the [[National Park of Abruzzo, Lazio e Molise]]]]
[[File:Canis Lupus Signatus.JPG|thumb|Iberian Wolves]]
Two subspecies not mentioned in the list above are the Italian Wolf (''Canis lupus italicus'') and the [[Iberian Wolf]] (''Canis lupus signatus''). The wolves of the Italian and Iberian peninsulas have [[Morphology (biology)|morphologically]] distinct features from other [[European wolf|Eurasian wolves]] and each are considered by their researchers to represent their own subspecies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.signatus.org/docs/situation.pdf The wolf in Spain]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.animalcorner.co.uk/wildlife/wolves/wolf_italian.html Canis lupus italicus]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Vos: ''Food habits and livestock depredation of two Iberian wolf packs (''Canis lupus signatus'') in the north of Portugal''. Journal of Zoology (2000), 251: 457-462 Cambridge University Press. [http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=54315 online abstract]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The genetic distinction of the Italian wolf subspecies was recently supported by analysis which consistently assigned all the wolf [[genotype]]s of a sample in [[Italy]] to a single group. This population also showed a unique [[mitochondrial DNA]] control-region [[haplotype]], the absence of private [[alleles]] and lower [[heterozygous|heterozygosity]] at microsatellite [[Locus (genetics)|loci]], as compared to other wolf populations.&lt;ref&gt;V. LUCCHINI, A. GALOV and E. RANDI'' Evidence of genetic distinction and long-term population decline in wolves (Canis lupus) in the Italian Apennines''. Molecular Ecology (2004) 13, 523–536. [http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/118794860/abstract abstract online]&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent genetic research suggests that the [[Indian Wolf]] populations in the [[Indian subcontinent]] may represent a distinct species from their [[conspecific]]s. Similar results were obtained for the [[Himalayan wolf]], which is traditionally placed under the [[Tibetan wolf]] (''Canis lupus laniger'').&lt;ref&gt;R. K. Aggarwal, T. Kivisild, J. Ramadevi, L. Singh:''Mitochondrial DNA coding region sequences support the phylogenetic distinction of two Indian wolf species.''

'''Central Asia''' is a core region of the [[Asia]]n [[continent]] from the [[Caspian Sea]] in the west, [[China]] in the east, [[Afghanistan]] in the south, and [[Russia]] in the north. It is also sometimes referred to as '''[[Middle Asia]]''', and, colloquially, &quot;the [[-stan|'stans]]&quot; (as the five countries generally considered to be within the region all have names ending with that suffix)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Paul McFedries |url=http://www.wordspy.com/words/stans.asp |title=stans |publisher=Word Spy |date=2001-10-25 |accessdate=2011-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is within the scope of the wider [[Eurasia]]n continent.

Various definitions of its exact composition exist, and no one definition is universally accepted. Despite this uncertainty in defining borders, it does have some important overall characteristics. For one, Central Asia has historically been closely tied to its [[nomad]]ic peoples and the [[Silk Road]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allempires.com/article/index.php?q=Central_Asia Steppe Nomads and Central Asia]&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, it has acted as a crossroads for the movement of people, goods, and ideas between [[Europe]], [[West Asia]], [[South Asia]], and [[East Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.silk-road.com/artl/srtravelmain.shtml Travelers on the Silk Road]&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern contexts,{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} all definitions of Central Asia consensually include these five{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} republics of the former [[Soviet Union]]: [[Kazakhstan]] (pop. 16.0 million), [[Kyrgyzstan]] (5.5 million), [[Tajikistan]] (7.3 million), [[Turkmenistan]] (5.1 million), and [[Uzbekistan]] (27.6 million), for a total population of 61.5 million as of 2009. Other areas often included are [[Mongolia]], [[Afghanistan]], northern and western [[Pakistan]], [[Khorasan Province|northeastern Iran]], [[Kashmir]], and sometimes [[Xinjiang]] in [[western China]] and southern [[Siberia]] in [[Russia]].

During pre-Islamic and early Islamic times, Central Asia was a predominantly [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]]&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Encyclopædia Iranica, &quot;CENTRAL ASIA: The Islamic period up to the mongols&quot;, C. Edmund Bosworth: &quot;In early Islamic times Persians tended to identify all the lands to the northeast of Khorasan and lying beyond the Oxus with the region of Turan, which in the Shahnama of Ferdowsi is regarded as the land allotted to Fereydun's son Tur. The denizens of Turan were held to include the Turks, in the first four centuries of Islam essentially those nomadizing beyond the Jaxartes, and behind them the Chinese (see Kowalski; Minorsky, &quot;Turan&quot;). Turan thus became both an ethnic and a diareeah term, but always containing ambiguities and contradictions, arising from the fact that all through Islamic times the lands immediately beyond the Oxus and along its lower reaches were the homes not of Turks but of Iranian peoples, such as the Sogdians and Khwarezmians.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C.E.

The ancient sedentary population played an important role in the history of Central Asia. After expansion by [[Turkic peoples]], Central Asia also became the homeland for many [[Turkic peoples]], including the [[Uzbeks]], [[Kazakhs]], [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]], and [[Uyghurs]], and Central Asia is sometimes referred to as [[Turkestan]].

==Definitions==
[[Image:Central Asia borders4.png|260px|thumb|Three sets of possible boundaries for the region]]
[[Image:Central Asia world region2.png|326px|thumb|Central Asia's location as a region of the world]]

The idea of Central Asia as a distinct region of the world was introduced in 1843 by the geographer [[Alexander von Humboldt]]. The borders of Central Asia are subject to multiple definitions. 

The most limited definition was the official one of the [[Soviet Union]], which defined Middle Asia as consisting solely of [[Uzbekistan]], [[Turkmenistan]], [[Tajikistan]] and [[Kyrgyzstan]]. This definition was also often used outside the USSR during this period.

However, the [[Russian culture]] has two distinct terms: ''Средняя Азия'' (''Srednjaja Azija'' or &quot;[[Middle Asia]]&quot;, the narrower definition, which includes only those traditionally non-Slavic, Central Asian lands that were incorporated within those borders of historical Russia) and ''Центральная Азия'' (''Central'naja Azija'' or &quot;Central Asia&quot;, the wider definition, which includes Central Asian lands that have never been part of historical Russia). 

Soon after independence, the leaders of the four former [[Soviet Central Asia|Soviet Central Asian Republics]] met in [[Tashkent]] and declared that the definition of Central Asia should include Kazakhstan as well as the original four included by the Soviets. Since then, this has become the most common definition of Central Asia.

The [[UNESCO]] general history of Central Asia, written just before the collapse of the USSR, defines the region based on climate and uses far larger borders. According to it, Central Asia includes [[Mongolia]], [[Tibet]], northeast [[Iran]] ([[Golestan Province|Golestan]], [[North Khorasan Province|North Khorasan]] and [[Razavi Khorasan Province|Razavi]] provinces), Afghanistan, [[Northern Areas]] and the [[N.W.F.P.]] province of [[Pakistan]], [[Kashmir]] and [[Ladakh]] of [[India]], central-east Russia south of the [[Taiga]], and the former Central Asian Soviet republics (the five &quot;Stans&quot; of the former [[Soviet Union]]).

An alternative method is to define the region based on ethnicity, and in particular, areas populated by Eastern [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]], Eastern [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]], or [[Mongols|Mongolian]] peoples. These areas include [[Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region]], the Turkic regions of southern [[Siberia]], the five republics, and [[Afghan Turkestan]]. Afghanistan as a whole, the Northern Areas of Pakistan and the [[Kashmir Valley]] may also be included. The [[Tibetans]] and [[Ladakhi]] are also included. Insofar, most of the mentioned peoples are considered the &quot;indigenous&quot; peoples of the vast region.

There are several places that claim to be the geographic center of Asia, for example [[Kyzyl]], the capital of [[Tuva]] in the [[Russian Federation]], and a village {{convert|200|mi|km|abbr=off|lk=off}} north of [[Ürümqi]], the capital of the [[Xinjiang]] region of China.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.confluence.org/confluence.php?visitid=12710 43°40'52&quot;N 87°19'52&quot;E] Degree Confluence Project.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
[[Image:Location-Asia-UNsubregions.png|thumb|225px|[[United Nations geoscheme for Asia]]:
{{legend|#0000E0|[[North Asia]]}}
{{legend|#E000E0|Central Asia}}
{{legend|#00E000|[[Southwest Asia]]}}
{{legend|#E00000|[[South Asia]]}}
{{legend|#FFFF20|[[East Asia]]}}
{{legend|#FFC000|[[Southeast Asia]]}}]]

Central Asia is an extremely large region of varied geography, including high passes and [[mountain ranges|mountains]] ([[Tian Shan]]), vast [[desert]]s ([[Kara Kum]], [[Kyzyl Kum]], [[Taklamakan]]), and especially treeless, grassy [[steppe]]s. The vast steppe areas of Central Asia are considered together with the steppes of [[Eastern Europe]] as a homogeneous geographical zone known as the [[Euro-Asian Steppe]].

Much of the land of Central Asia is too dry or too rugged for farming. The [[Gobi desert]] extends from the foot of the [[Pamir Mountains|Pamirs]], 77°&amp;nbsp;E, to the [[Great Khingan]] (Da Hinggan) Mountains, 116°–118°&amp;nbsp;E.

Central Asia has the following geographic extremes:
* The world's northernmost [[desert]] ([[dune|sand dunes]]), at Buurug Deliin Els, [[Mongolia]], 50°18′&amp;nbsp;N.
* The [[Northern Hemisphere|Northern Hemisphere's]] southernmost [[permafrost]], at Erdenetsogt sum, [[Mongolia]], 46°17′&amp;nbsp;N.
* The world's shortest distance between non-frozen [[desert]] and [[permafrost]]: {{convert|770|km|mi|abbr=on|lk=off}}.
* The Eurasian [[pole of inaccessibility]].

A majority of the people earn a living by herding livestock. Industrial activity centers in the region's cities.

Major rivers of the region include the [[Amu Darya]], the [[Syr Darya]] and the [[Hari River, Afghanistan|Hari River]]. Major bodies of water include the [[Aral Sea]] and [[Lake Balkhash]], both of which are part of the huge west-central Asian [[endorheic]] basin that also includes the [[Caspian Sea]].

Both of these bodies of water have shrunk significantly in recent decades due to diversion of water from rivers that feed them for irrigation and industrial purposes. Water is an extremely valuable resource in arid Central Asia and can lead to rather significant international disputes.

==Divisions==
The northern belt is part of the [[Eurasian Steppe]]. In the northwest, north of the Caspian Sea, Central Asia merges into the Russian Steppe. To the northeast, [[Dzungaria]] and the [[Tarim Basin]] may sometimes be included in Central Asia. Just west of Dzungaria, [[Zhetysu]], or Semirechye, is south of [[Lake Balkhash]] and north of the [[Tian Shan]] Mountains. [[Khorezm]] is south of the [[Aral Sea]] along the [[Amu Darya]]. Southeast of the Aral Sea, Maveranahr is between the Amu Darya and Syr Darya. [[Transoxiana]] is the land north of the middle and upper Amu Darya (Oxus). [[Bactria]] included northern Afghanistan and the upper Amu Darya. [[Sogdiana]] was north of Bactria and included the trading cities of Bukhara and Samarkhand. [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] and [[Margiana]] approximate northeastern Iran. The [[Kyzyl Kum]] Desert is northeast of the Amu Darya, and the [[Karakum Desert]] southwest of it.

===Climate===

Since Central Asia is not buffered by a large body of water, temperature fluctuations are more severe.

According to the [[Biome#WWF system|WWF Ecozones system]], Central Asia is part of the [[Palearctic]] [[ecozone]]. The largest [[biome]] in Central Asia is the [[Temperate grasslands, savannas, and shrublands]] biome. Central Asia also contains the [[Montane grasslands and shrublands]], [[Deserts and xeric shrublands]] and [[Temperate coniferous forests]] biomes.

==History==
{{Main|History of Central Asia}}
[[Image:Scythia-Parthia 100 BC.png|thumb|right|160px|Geographical extent of Iranian influence in the 1st century BC. [[Scythia]] (mostly [[Eastern Iranian languages|Eastern Iranian]]) is shown in orange.]]
[[Image:PazyrikHorseman.JPG|thumb|130px|A [[Scythian]] horseman from the general area of the [[Ili river]], [[Ukok Plateau|Pazyryk]], c. [[300 BCE]]]]
The history of Central Asia is defined by the area's climate and geography. The aridness of the region made [[Agriculture in Central Asia|agriculture]] difficult, and its distance from the sea cut it off from much trade. Thus, few major cities developed in the region; instead, the area was for millennia dominated by the nomadic horse peoples of the [[steppe]].

Relations between the [[Eurasian nomads|steppe nomads]] and the settled people in and around Central Asia were long marked by conflict. The nomadic lifestyle was well suited to [[war]]fare, and the steppe [[Horses in warfare|horse riders]] became some of the most militarily potent peoples in the world, limited only by their lack of internal unity. Any internal unity that was achieved was most probably due to the influence of the [[Silk Road]], which traveled along Central Asia. Periodically, great leaders or changing conditions would organize several tribes into one force and create an almost unstoppable power. These included the [[Huns|Hun]] invasion of Europe, the [[Wu Hu]] attacks on China and most notably the [[Timeline of Mongol conquests|Mongol conquest]] of much of [[Eurasia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfusd.k12.ca.us/schwww/sch618/Ibn_Battuta/Battuta's_Trip_Three.html A Land Conquered by the Mongols]&lt;/ref&gt;

During pre-Islamic and early Islamic times, southern Central Asia was inhabited predominantly by speakers of [[Iranian languages]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C.E. Bosworth, &quot;The Appearance of the Arabs in Central Asia under the Umayyads and the establishment of Islam&quot;, in ''History of Civilizations of Central Asia'', Vol. IV: The Age of Achievement: AD 750 to the End of the Fifteenth Century, Part One: The Historical, Social and Economic Setting, edited by M.

The main migration of [[Turkic peoples]] occurred between the 5th and 10th centuries, when they spread across most of Central Asia. During the 13th and 14th centuries, the [[Mongols]] conquered and ruled the largest contiguous empire in recorded history.

The dominance of the nomads ended in the 16th century, as [[firearm]]s allowed settled peoples to gain control of the region. [[Russia]], [[China]], and other powers expanded into the region and had captured the bulk of Central Asia by the end of the 19th century. After the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]], the Central Asian regions were incorporated into the Soviet Union. Mongolia remained independent but became a Soviet [[satellite state]]. However, Afghanistan remained independent of any influence by the Russian empire.

The Soviet areas of Central Asia saw much industrialization and construction of infrastructure, but also the suppression of local cultures, hundreds of thousands of deaths from failed collectivization programs, and a lasting legacy of ethnic tensions and environmental problems. Soviet authorities [[Population transfer in the Soviet Union|deported]] millions of people, including entire nationalities,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faqs.org/minorities/USSR/Deported-Nationalities.html Deported Nationalities]&lt;/ref&gt; from western areas of the USSR to Central Asia and [[Siberia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anneapplebaum.com/gulag/intro.html Anne Applebaum – Gulag: A History Intro]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Touraj Atabaki and Sanjyot Mehendale, &quot;From 1959 to 1970, about two million people from various parts of the Soviet Union migrated to Central Asia, of which about one million moved to Kazakhstan.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;''[http://books.google.com/books?id=zwKBZmpBo5YC&amp;pg=PA66&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Central Asia and the Caucasus: transnationalism and diaspora]''&quot;. Touraj Atabaki, Sanjyot Mehendale (2005). p.66. ISBN 0-415-33260-5&lt;/ref&gt;

With the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]], five countries gained independence. In nearly all the new states, former Communist Party officials retained power as local strongmen. None of the new republics could be considered functional democracies in the early days of independence, although it appears [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Kazakhstan]] and [[Mongolia]] have made great strides, unlike [[Uzbekistan]], [[Tajikistan]], and [[Turkmenistan]].{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

==Culture==
[[File:Ertugrul Gazi Mosque in Ashgabat, Turkmenistan.jpg|thumb|The [[Ertugrul gazi|Ärtogrul Gazy Mosque]] in [[Ashgabat]] named after the father of [[Osman I|Osman Ghazi]], the founder of the [[Ottoman Empire]]]]
===Religions===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Kashgar]] --&gt;
{{see|Islam in Central Asia}}
[[Islam]] is the religion most common in the [[Central Asian Republics]], [[Afghanistan]], Xinjiang and the peripheral western regions, such as [[Bashkiria]]. Most Central Asian Muslims are [[Sunni]], although there are sizable [[Shia Islam|Shia]] minorities in Afghanistan and Tajikistan.

[[Buddhism in Central Asia|Buddhism]] was prominent in Central Asia prior to the arrival of Islam, and the [[Silk Road transmission of Buddhism|transmission of Buddhism along the Silk Road]] eventually brought the religion to China. Amongst the [[Turkic peoples]], [[Tengriism|Tengrianism]] was the popular religion before arrival of Islam. [[Tibetan Buddhism]] is most common in Tibet, Mongolia, [[Ladakh]] and the southern Russian regions of Siberia, where [[Shamanism]] is also popular (including forms of [[divination]], such as [[Kumalak]]). Contact and migration with [[Han Chinese|Han people]] from China has brought [[Confucianism]] and other beliefs into the region.

[[Nestorianism]] was the form of Christianity most practiced in the region in previous centuries, but now the largest denomination is the [[Russian Orthodox Church]], with many members in Kazakhstan. The [[Bukharan Jews]] were once a sizable community in Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, but nearly all have emigrated since the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]].

===Arts===
{{see|Music of Central Asia}}
[[Image:Yama the Lord of Death.jpg|thumb|left|100px|[[Yama (Buddhism and Chinese mythology)|Yama]], the Lord of Death. Note the human skulls and severed heads that festoon Yama's crown and necklace, which give some concept of the size that Yama was expected to be when one faced him at one's death. This particular [[Dharmapala]] is painted wood, four feet high in total.]]
At the crossroads of Asia, shamanistic practices live alongside [[Buddhism]]. Thus, [[Yama (Buddhism and Chinese mythology)|Yama]], Lord of Death, was revered in Tibet as a spiritual guardian and judge. Mongolian Buddhism, in particular, influenced Tibetan Buddhism. The [[Qianlong]] Emperor of China in the 18th century was Tibetan Buddhist and would sometimes travel from [[Beijing]] to other cities for personal religious worship.

Central Asia also has an indigenous form of improvisational [[oral poetry]] that is over 1000 years old. It is principally practiced in Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan by ''akyns'', lyrical improvisationists. They engage in [[Freestyle battle|lyrical battles]], the ''aitysh'' or the ''alym sabak''. The tradition arose out of early bardic [[Oral history|oral historians]]. They are usually accompanied by a [[String instrument|stringed instrument]]—in Kyrgyzstan, a three-stringed ''[[komuz]]'', and in Kazakhstan, a similar two-stringed instrument.

Photography in Central Asia began to develop after 1882, when a [[Russian Mennonite]] [[photographer]] named Wilhelm Penner moved to the [[Khanate of Khiva]] during the Mennonite migration to Central Asia led by [[Claas Epp, Jr.]]. Upon his arrival to [[Khanate of Khiva]], Penner shared his photography skills with a local student Khudaybergen Divanov, who later became the founder of the [[Uzbek photography]].&lt;ref&gt;Walter Ratliff, &quot;Pilgrims on the Silk Road: A Muslim-Christian Encounter in Khiva&quot;, Wipf and Stock Publishers, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Some also learn to sing the ''[[Manas (epic)|Manas]]'', Kyrgyzstan's epic poem (those who learn the ''Manas'' exclusively but do not improvise are called ''manaschis''). During Soviet rule, ''akyn'' performance was co-opted by the authorities and subsequently declined in popularity. With the fall of the Soviet Union, it has enjoyed a resurgence, although ''akyns'' still do use their art to campaign for political candidates. A 2005 ''[[Washington Post]]'' article proposed a similarity between the improvisational art of ''akyns'' and modern [[freestyle rap]] performed in the West.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A10646-2005Mar5.html «In Central Asia, a Revival of an Ancient Form of Rap - Art of Ad-Libbing Oral History Draws New Devotees in Post-Communist Era» by Peter Finn, Washington Post Foreign Service, Sunday, March 6, 2005, p. A20.]&lt;/ref&gt;

As a consequence of Russian colonization, European fine arts - painting, sculpture and graphics - have developed in Central Asia. The first years of the Soviet regime saw the appearance of modernism, which took inspiration from the Russian avant-garde movement. Until the 80's Central Asian arts had developed along with general tendencies of Soviet arts. In the 90's, arts of the region underwent some significant changes. Institutionally speaking, some fields of arts were regulated by the birth of the art market, some stayed as representatives of official views, while many were sponsored by international organizations. The years of 1990 - 2000 were times for the establishment of contemporary arts. In the region, many important international exhibitions are taking place, Central Asian art is represented in European and American museums, and the Central Asian Pavilion at the Venice Biennale has been organized since 2005.

==Demographics==
{{Main|Demography of Central Asia}}
[[Image:Central Asia Ethnic en.svg|thumb|right|250px|The ethnolinguistic patchwork of Central Asia]]
By a broad definition including Mongolia and Afghanistan, but excluding Pakistan, more than 90 million people live in Central Asia, about 2% of Asia's total population. Of the regions of Asia, only [[North Asia]] has fewer people. It has a population density of 9 people per km², vastly less than the 80.5 people per km² of the continent as a whole.

===Languages===
&lt;!-- ''[[Central Asian Languages|Main Article]]'' --&gt;

[[Russian language|Russian]], as well as being spoken by around six million ethnic [[Russians]] and [[Ukrainians]] of Central Asia,&lt;ref&gt;Robert Greenall, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4420922.stm Russians left behind in Central Asia], [[BBC News]], 23 November 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; is the defacto [[lingua franca]] throughout the former Soviet [[Central Asian Republics]]. [[Chinese language|Mandarin Chinese]] has an equally dominant presence in [[Inner Mongolia]], [[Qinghai]] and [[Xinjiang]].

The languages of the majority of the inhabitants of the former Soviet [[Central Asian Republics]] come from the [[Turkic languages|Turkic language group]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hunmagyar.org/turan/ethno.html Ethnographic maps]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Turkmen language|Turkmen]], is mainly spoken in [[Turkmenistan]], and as a minority language in [[Afghanistan]], [[Iran]] and [[Turkey]]. [[Kazakh language|Kazakh]] and [[Kyrgyz language|Kyrgyz]] are related languages of the [[Kipchaks|Kypchak]] group of Turkic languages and are spoken throughout [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], and as a minority language in [[Tajikistan]], [[Afghanistan]] and [[Xinjiang]]. [[Uzbek language|Uzbek]] and [[Uyghur language|Uyghur]] are spoken in [[Uzbekistan]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Afghanistan]] and [[Xinjiang]].

The [[Turkic language]]s belong to the much larger, but controversial, [[Altaic language]] family, which includes [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]]. Mongolian is spoken throughout Mongolia and into Buryatia, Kalmyk, Tuva, Inner Mongolia, and Xinjiang.

[[Iranian languages]] were once spoken throughout Central Asia, such as the once prominent [[Sogdian language|Sogdian]], [[Khwarezmian language|Khwarezmian]], [[Bactrian language|Bactrian]] and [[Scythian language|Scythian]] languages are now extinct. The Eastern Iranian language of [[Pashto language|Pashto]] is still spoken in [[Afghanistan]] and northwestern [[Pakistan]], and other minor East Iranian languages, such as [[Shughni language|Shughni]], [[Munji language|Munji]], [[Ishkashimi language|Ishkashimi]], [[Sarikoli language|Sarikoli]], [[Wakhi language|Wakhi]], [[Yaghnobi language|Yaghnobi]] and [[Ossetic language|Ossetian]], are also spoken in various places in Central Asia. Varieties of [[Persian language|Persian]] are also spoken as a major language in the region. Locally known as [[Dari (Eastern Persian)|Darī]] (in Afghanistan), [[Tajik language|Tojikī]] (by Tajiks in Tajikistan), and [[Bukhori language|Bukhori]] (by the [[Bukharan Jews]] all over Central Asia).

Other languages and language groups include the [[Tibetan language]], spoken by around six million people across the [[Tibetan Plateau]] and into [[Qinghai]], [[Sichuan]] and Ladakh. [[Dardic languages]], such as [[Shina language|Shina]], [[Kashmiri language|Kashmiri]] and [[Khowar]], are predominant in the northern areas of Pakistan, as well as in Ladakh of [[India]] and NWFP of [[Pakistan]].

As a note, [[Tocharian languages|Tocharian]], an [[Indo-European]] language, was once spoken in [[Xinjiang]] and parts of [[Tokharistan|Afghanistan]], but is now extinct.

==Geostrategy==
{{Main|Geostrategy in Central Asia}}

Central Asia has long been a strategic location merely because of its proximity to several great powers on the Eurasian landmass. The region itself never held a dominant stationary population nor was able to make use of natural resources. Thus, it has rarely throughout history become the seat of power for an empire or influential state. Central Asia has been divided, redivided, conquered out of existence, and fragmented time and time again. Central Asia has served more as the battleground for outside powers than as a power in its own right.

Central Asia had both the advantage and disadvantage of a central location between four historical seats of power. From its central location, it has access to trade routes to and from all the regional powers. On the other hand, it has been continuously vulnerable to attack from all sides throughout its history, resulting in political fragmentation or outright power vacuum, as it is successively dominated.
[[Image:Great Game cartoon from 1878.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Political cartoon from the period of the [[The Great Game|Great Game]] showing the Afghan Amir Sher Ali with his &quot;friends&quot; Imperial Russia and the United Kingdom (1878)]]
* To the North, the steppe allowed for rapid mobility, first for nomadic horseback warriors like the Huns and Mongols, and later for Russian traders, eventually supported by railroads. As the Russian Empire expanded to the East, it would also push down into Central Asia towards the sea, in a search for warm water ports. The Soviet bloc would reinforce dominance from the North and attempt to project power as far south as Afghanistan.
* To the East, the demographic and cultural weight of Chinese empires continually pushed outward into Central Asia. The Manchu Qing dynasty would conquer Xinjiang and Tibet. However, with the Sino-Soviet split, China would project power into Central Asia, most notably in the case of Afghanistan, to counter Russian dominance of the region.
* To the Southeast, the demographic and cultural influence of India was felt in Central Asia, notably in Tibet, the Hindu Kush, and slightly beyond. Several historical Indian dynasties, especially those seated along the Indus River, would expand into Central Asia. India's ability to project power into Central Asia has been limited due to the mountain ranges in Pakistan, as well as the cultural differences between Hindu India and what would become a mostly Muslim Central Asia. From its base in India, the [[British Empire]] competed with the Russian Empire for influence in the region in the 19th and 20th centuries.
* To the Southwest, Western Asian powers have expanded into the southern areas of Central Asia (usually Uzbekistan, Afghanistan, and Pakistan). Several Persian empires would conquer and reconquer parts of Central Asia; Alexander the Great's Hellenic empire would extend into Central Asia; two Islamic empires would exert substantial influence throughout the region; and the modern state of Iran has projected influence throughout the region as well.

In the post–Cold War era, Central Asia is an ethnic cauldron, prone to instability and conflicts, without a sense of national identity, but rather a mess of historical cultural influences, tribal and clan loyalties, and religious fervor. Projecting influence into the area is no longer just Russia, but also Turkey, Iran, China, Pakistan, India and the United States:
* Russia continues to dominate political decision-making throughout the former SSRs; although, as other countries move into the area, Russia's influence has begun to wane.
* The United States, with its military involvement in the region and oil diplomacy, is also significantly involved in the region's politics. The United States and other NATO members are the main contributors to the [[International Security Assistance Force]] in Afghanistan and also exert considerable influence in other Central Asian nations.
* China has security ties with Central Asian states through the [[Shanghai Cooperation Organization]], and conducts energy trade [[bilaterally]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cfr.org/publication/10883/shanghai_cooperation_organization.html|title=The Shanghai Cooperation Organization|first=Andrew|last=Scheineson|date=2009-03-24|accessdate=2010-09-24|work=Backgrounder|publisher=[[Council on Foreign Relations]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* India has geographic proximity to the Central Asian region and, in addition, enjoys considerable influence on Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7492982.stm India: Afghanistan's influential ally]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1945666,00.html India, Pakistan and the Battle for Afghanista]&lt;/ref&gt; India maintains a military base at [[Farkhor Air Base|Farkhor]], Tajikistan, and also has extensive military relations with Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan.&lt;ref name=Reiter&gt;{{cite book

* Turkey also exerts considerable influence in the region on account of its ethnic and linguistic ties with the Turkic peoples of Central Asia and its involvement in the [[Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline|Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline]]. Political and economic relations are growing rapidly (e.g., Turkey recently eliminated visa requirements for citizens of the Central Asian Turkic republics).
* Iran, the seat of historical empires that controlled parts of Central Asia, has historical and cultural links to the region and is vying to construct an oil pipeline from the Caspian Sea to the Persian Gulf.
* [[Pakistan]], a nuclear-armed Islamic state, helped to sustain Taliban rule in Afghanistan and is termed capable of exercising influence. For some Central Asian nations, the shortest route to the ocean lies through Pakistan. Pakistan seeks [[natural gas]] from Central Asia and supports the development of pipelines from its countries.

===War on Terror===
In the context of the United States' [[War on Terror]], Central Asia has once again become the center of geostrategic calculations. Pakistan's status has been upgraded by the U.S. government to [[Major non-NATO ally]] because of its central role in serving as a staging point for the invasion of Afghanistan, providing intelligence on Al-Qaeda operations in the region, and leading the hunt on Osama bin Laden, believed to still be in the region.

Afghanistan, which had served as a haven and source of support for Al-Qaeda under the protection of Mullah Omar and the [[Taliban]], was the target of a [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|U.S. invasion]] in 2001 and ongoing reconstruction and drug-eradication efforts. U.S. military bases have also been established in Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan, causing both Russia and the People's Republic of China to voice their concern over a permanent U.S. military presence in the region.

Western governments have accused Russia, China and the former Soviet republics of justifying the suppression of separatist movements, and the associated ethnics and religion with the War on Terror.

| The capital and second largest city in Kazakhstan. After Kazakhstan gained its independence in 1991, the city and the region were renamed Aqmola. The name was often translated as &quot;White Tombstone&quot;, but actually means &quot;Holy Place&quot; or &quot;Holy Shrine&quot;. The &quot;White Tombstone&quot; literal translation was too appropriate for many visitors to escape notice in almost all guide books and travel accounts. In 1994, the city was designated as the future capital of the newly independent country and again renamed to the present Astana after the capital was officially moved from [[Almaty]] in 1997.

At the beginning of the 9th century (3rd century AH), Mashhad was a small village called Sanabad situated 24&amp;nbsp;km away from [[Tous, Iran|Tus]]. It was not considered a great city until [[Mongol raids]] in 1220 caused the destruction of many large cities in the [[Greater Khorasan]] territories, leaving Mashhad relatively intact. Thus, the survivors of the massacres migrated to Mashhad.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zabeth 1999 pp. 14-15&quot;&gt;Zabeth (1999) pp. 14-15&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Couscous''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|icon|ˈ|k|ʊ|s|k|ʊ|s}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|uː|s|k|uː|s}}) is a [[North Africa]]n dish of [[semolina]] traditionally served with a [[meat]] or [[vegetable]] [[stew]] spooned over it. Couscous is a staple food throughout West Africa, Sahel, France, Spain, and the Canary Islands, Portugal, Madeira, Italy (particularly in western Sicily's Province of Trapani), as well as in Turkey, Greece, Malta, Cyprus, the Middle East and India.

==Etymology==
The name is derived from [[Berber languages|Berber]] ''seksu''&lt;ref&gt;DALLET Jean.-Marie : ''Dictionnaire kabyle-française'', Paris, SELAF, 1982. p. 709.&lt;/ref&gt; (meaning ''well rolled'', ''well formed'', ''rounded'').&lt;ref&gt;CHAKER, Salem : ''Couscous : sur l’étymologie du mot''&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous different names and pronunciations for couscous exist around the world. Couscous is {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ʊ|s|k|ʊ|s}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|uː|s|k|uː|s}} in the [[United Kingdom]] and only the former in the [[United States]]. In [[Berber language|Berber]], it is known as ''Seksu'' and in {{lang-ar|كسكس}} pronounced ''Kuskus''. In [[Israel]], couscous is known as {{lang-he|קוסקוס}}. It is known as ''Kuskus'' in [[Morocco]], [[Algeria]], [[Turkey]], [[Libya]], ''Kuseksi'' in [[Tunisia]] and ''Kuskusi'' {{lang-ar|كسكسي}} in [[Egypt]]. The variant ''Keskesu'' is mainly used by the [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]].&lt;ref&gt;FOUCAULD Charles de : ''Dictionnaire touareg-français'', Paris, Imprimerie Nationale, 1950-52, p. 919&lt;/ref&gt; In Libya, it is commonly called &quot;Kusksi,&quot; though &quot;Kisksu&quot; is also used. In Malta, something called ''Kusksu'' is similar but much larger in size. At Trapani in Sicily, ''Cuscusu'' is served with fish, like trout or anchovies. A similar dish known as &quot;Migas de harina&quot; is typical of South Eastern Spain, particularly the regions of [[Almería]] and [[Murcia]].

==History==
One of the first written references is from an [[anonymous work|anonymous]] 13th-century Moroccan/Andalusian [[cookbook]], ''Kitāb al-tabǐkh fǐ al-Maghrib wa'l-Andalus'' ([[Arabic]]) &quot;The cookbook of the Maghreb and [[Al-Andalus]]&quot;, with a [http://www.daviddfriedman.com/Medieval/Cookbooks/Andalusian/andalusian8.htm recipe] for couscous that was 'known all over the world'. Couscous was known to the [[Nasrid dynasty|Nasrid]] royalty in [[Granada#Nasrid Emirate of Granada|Granada]] as well. And in the 13th century a [[Greater Syria|Syria]]n historian from [[Aleppo]] includes four references for couscous. These early mentions show that couscous spread rapidly, but generally that couscous was common from [[Tripolitania]] to the west, while from [[Cyrenaica]] to the east the main cuisine was Egyptian, with couscous as an occasional dish. Today, in Egypt and the Middle East, couscous is known, but in Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia and Western Libya couscous is a staple. Couscous was taken from Syria to [[Turkey]] in 16th century and is eaten in most of southern [[province]]s.

Couscous is a staple of Sicilian cuisine. In Rome [[Bartolomeo Scappi]]'s culinary guide of 1570 describes a Moorish dish, ''succussu''; in [[Tuscany]].&lt;ref&gt;John Dickie, ''Delizia! The Epic History of the Italians and Their Food'' (New York, 2008) pp. 15, 115, 264f.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the earliest references to couscous in [[Western Europe]] is in [[Brittany]], in a letter dated 12 January 1699. But it made an earlier appearance in [[Provence]], where the traveler [[Jean Jacques Bouchard]] wrote of eating it in [[Toulon]] in 1630.
Couscous was originally made from [[millet]].&lt;ref&gt;See numerous books describing couscous as boiled millet: http://www.google.com/search?tbo=p&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=millet+couscous&amp;tbs=,cdr:1,cd_min:Jan%203_2%201,cd_max:Dec%2031_2%201922&amp;num=10#q=millet+couscous&amp;hl=en&amp;tbs=bks:1,cdr:1,cd_min:Jan+3_2+1,cd_max:Dec+31_2+1922&amp;ei=vGxCTdLYEcPbgQeFnc2JAg&amp;start=0&amp;sa=N&amp;fp=64aa18c4243f0c16&lt;/ref&gt; Historians have different opinions as to when [[wheat]] began to replace the use of millet. The conversion seems to have occurred sometime in the 20th century, although many regions continue to use the traditional millet. Couscous seems to have a North African origin. Archaeological evidence dating back to the 9th century, consisting of kitchen utensils needed to prepare this dish, has been found in this part of the world.

In some regions couscous is made from coarsely ground [[barley]] or [[pearl millet]]. In [[Brazil]], the traditional couscous is made from [[cornmeal]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://revistagloborural.globo.com/GloboRural/0,6993,EEC533123-1488-4,00.html Receitas&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preparation==
The semolina is sprinkled with water and rolled with the hands to form small pellets, sprinkled with dry flour to keep them separate, and then sieved. Any pellets which are too large to be finished granules of couscous and fall through the sieve will be again rolled and sprinkled with dry semolina and rolled into pellets. This process continues until all the semolina has been formed into tiny granules of couscous. This process is very labour-intensive. In the traditional method of preparing couscous, groups of women would come together and make large batches over several days.[4] These would then be dried in the sun and used for several months. Couscous was traditionally made from the hard part of the durum, the part of the grain that resisted the grinding of the relatively primitive millstone. In modern times, couscous production is largely mechanized, and the product is sold in markets around the world.

In the [[Sahel]]ian countries of West Africa, such as [[Mali]] and [[Senegal]], [[pearl millet]] is pounded or milled to the size and consistency necessary for the couscous.&lt;ref&gt;Sivak MN. Starch: Basic Science to Biotechnology. Academic Press, 1998, ISBN 0-12-016441-8, p. 132&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Couscoussier.jpg|thumb|150px|right|A ''couscoussière'', a traditional steamer for couscous.]]

Properly cooked couscous is light and fluffy, not gummy or gritty. Traditionally, North Africans use a [[food steamer]] (called a كسكس ''kiskas'' in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] or a ''couscoussière'' in [[French language|French]]). The base is a tall metal pot shaped rather like an oil jar in which the meat and vegetables are cooked as a stew. On top of the base, a steamer sits where the couscous is cooked, absorbing the flavours from the stew. The lid to the steamer has holes around its edge so steam can escape. It is also possible to use a pot with a steamer insert. If the holes are too big the steamer can be lined with damp [[cheesecloth]]. There is little [[archaeology|archaeological]] evidence of early diets including couscous, possibly because the original ''couscoussière'' was probably made from organic materials which could not survive extended exposure to the elements.

==Instant couscous==
The couscous that is sold in most [[Western culture|Western]] supermarkets has been pre-steamed and dried, the package directions usually instruct to add 1.5 measures of boiling water or stock and butter to each measure of couscous and to cover tightly for 5 minutes. The couscous swells and within a few minutes it is ready to fluff with a fork and serve. Pre-steamed couscous takes less time to prepare than regular couscous, most dried [[pasta]], or dried grains (such as [[rice]]).

==Local variations==
[[File:Moroccan couscous2006.jpg|thumb|240px|right|Moroccan couscous with vegetables and raisins]]
In Libya, Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia, couscous is generally served with vegetables ([[carrot]]s, [[potatoes]], [[turnip]]s, ''[[wikt:etc.|etc.]]'') cooked in a spicy or mild [[broth]] or stew, and some meat (generally, [[chicken]], [[lamb and mutton|lamb]] or [[lamb and mutton|mutton]]).

In Libya, it is mostly served with meat, specifically [[beef]], lamb, or [[Camel#Cuisine|camel]]. In Tripoli and the western parts of Libya, but not during official ceremonies or weddings. Another way to eat couscous is as a dessert; it is prepared with dates, sesame, and pure honey, and locally referred to as &quot;maghrood&quot;.

In Tunisia, it is made mostly spicy with [[harissa]] sauce, it is served with almost everything, including lamb, beef, camel, and poultry. Fish couscous is Tunisian specialty, it can be also made with octopus in hot red spicy sauce. Couscous in Tunisia is served on every occasion; it is also served sweetened as dessert called masfouf, mostly during [[Ramadan]].

In Morocco and Algeria it is also served, sometimes at the end of a meal or just by itself, as a delicacy called ''&quot;seffa&quot;''. The couscous is usually steamed several times until it is very fluffy and pale in color. It is then sprinkled with [[almond]]s, [[cinnamon]] and [[sugar]]. Traditionally, this dessert will be served with milk perfumed with [[orange flower water]], or it can be served plain with [[buttermilk]] in a bowl as a cold light soup for supper.

In [[Egypt]], couscous is eaten more as a dessert. It is prepared with butter, sugar, cinnamon, raisins, nuts and topped with cream.

Couscous is also very popular in France, where it is now considered a traditional dish, and has also become popular in Spain, Portugal, Italy, and Greece. Indeed, many polls have indicated that it is often a favorite dish.&lt;ref name=&quot;2emeprefere&quot;&gt;[http://www.tns-sofres.com/etudes/pol/230306_platspreferes_r.htm &quot;Notre Temps&quot;] Study conducted on January 11 and 12, 2006 for the magazine Notre Temps based on face-to-face interviews with a sample of {{formatnum:1000}} people representative of the adult French population, stratified by age, sex, profession of the head of household, region and type of municipality.&lt;/ref&gt; Although introduced in France by the ''[[Pied-noir|pieds noirs]]'' (people of European descent who used to live in Algeria), many couscous restaurants are now owned by people originating from Algeria. In France, Spain, Italy, and Portugal, the word &quot;couscous&quot; (''cuscús'' in Spanish, Portuguese, and Italian) usually refers to couscous together with the stew. Packaged sets containing a box of quick-preparation couscous and a can of vegetables and, generally, meat are sold in French, Spanish, Italian, and Portuguese [[grocery store]]s and [[supermarket]]s. In France, it is generally served with [[harissa]] sauce, and in Italy, it can be served with [[marinara sauce]].

In [[North America]], [[Australia]], and the [[United Kingdom]]{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}, couscous is available most commonly as either plain or pre-flavoured, quick preparation boxes. In the United States, it is widely available, but largely confined to the [[ethnic group|ethnic]] or [[health food|health-food]] section of larger grocery stores.

There are [[recipe]]s from [[Brazil]] and other [[Latin America]]n countries that use boiled couscous molded into a [[Timbale (food)|timbale]] with other ingredients. In northeastern Brazil, ''cuzcuz'', a steamed cake of couscous and corn flour (a mixture called fubá, pronounced ''foo-BAH''), is a popular meal, served in many forms: With sugar and milk, with varied meats, with cheese and eggs, and so on. In [[Mexico]], there are two dishes called the ''couscous [[taco]]'' (''taco de cuscús'') and ''couscous [[burrito]]'' (''burrito de cuscús''), which consists of the addition of couscous to a traditional taco or burrito respectively, similar in fashion to a Moroccan pita.

==Nutrition==
Couscous is among the healthiest grain-based products. It has a [[glycemic load]] per gram 25% below that of [[pasta]]. It has a superior vitamin profile to pasta, containing twice as much [[riboflavin]], [[niacin]], [[vitamin B6]], and [[folate]], and containing four times as much [[thiamine]] and [[pantothenic acid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In terms of protein, couscous has 3.6&amp;nbsp;g for every 100 calories, equivalent to pasta, and well above the 2.6&amp;nbsp;g for every 100 calories of [[white rice]]. Furthermore, couscous contains a 1% fat-to-calorie ratio, compared to 3% for white rice, 5% for pasta, and 11.3% for [[rice pilaf]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Constantius II''' ({{lang-la|[[Flavius]] Julius Constantius Augustus}};&lt;ref&gt;In [[Classical Latin]], Constantius' name would be inscribed as &lt;small&gt;FLAVIVS IVLIVS CONSTANTIVS AVGVSTVS&lt;/small&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;CIL 06, 40776 = AE 1934, 00158 = AE 1950, 00174 = AE 1951, 00102 = AE 1982, 00011&lt;/ref&gt; August 7, 317 – November 3, 361), was [[Roman Emperor]] from 337 to 361. The second son of [[Constantine I]] and [[Fausta]], he ascended to the throne with his brothers [[Constantine II (emperor)|Constantine II]] and [[Constans]] upon their father's death. 

In 340, Constantius' brothers clashed over the western provinces of the empire. The resulting conflict left Constantine II dead and Constans as ruler of the west until he was overthrown and assassinated in 350 by the [[usurper]] [[Magnentius]]. Unwilling to accept Magnentius as co-ruler, Constantius marched against him. Magnentius was defeated at the battles of [[Battle of Mursa Major|Mursa Major]] and [[Battle of Mons Seleucus|Mons Seleucus]], committing suicide after the latter. This left Constantius as sole ruler of the empire. 

His subsequent military campaigns against Germanic tribes were successful: he defeated the [[Alamanni]] in 354, and campaigned across the [[Danube]] against the [[Quadi]] and [[Sarmatians]] in 357. Contrastingly, in the east, the two decade old war against the [[Sassanids]] continued with mixed results. 

As a consequence of the difficulty of managing the entire empire alone, Constantius elevated two of his cousins to the subordinate rank of [[Caesar (title)|Caesar]]. [[Constantius Gallus]], the eldest surviving son of Constantius' half-uncle, [[Julius Constantius]], was promoted in 351, but executed three years later for his supposedly violent and corrupt nature. Constantius then promoted Gallus' younger half-brother, Julian, who was Constantius' last surviving cousin and the man who would ultimately succeed him, in 355. 

However, the actions of Julian in claiming the rank of [[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]] in 360 led to war between the two. Ultimately, no battle ever took place as Constantius became ill and died late in 361, though not before naming his opponent as his successor.

==Early life==
[[File:Impero Romano da maggio a settembre 337.png|thumb|left|Division of the Roman Empire among the Caesars appointed by [[Constantine I]]: from left to right, the territories of [[Constantine II (emperor)|Constantine II]], [[Constans I]], [[Dalmatius]] and Constantius II. After the death of Constantine I (May 337), this was the formal division of the Empire, until Dalmatius was killed and his territory divided between Constans and Constantius.]]
Constantius was born in 317 at [[Sirmium]], [[Pannonia]]. He was the third son of [[Constantine the Great]], and second by his second wife [[Fausta]], the daughter of [[Maximian]]. Constantius was made [[Caesar (title)|Caesar]] by his father on 13 November 324.&lt;ref&gt;DiMaio Jr., M. &amp; Frakes, R. 'DIR-Constantius II' from De Imperatoribus Romanis [http://www.roman-emperors.org/constaii.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

When his father died at [[Constantinople]] on 22 May 337, Constantius was the nearest of his sons to that city. Although on campaign in the eastern provinces, he immediately returned to the city to oversee his father's funeral.&lt;ref&gt;Odahl, C.M., ''Constantine and the Christian Empire'' (2004), p. 275&lt;/ref&gt;

The role of Constantius in the massacre of his relatives descended from the second marriage of his paternal grandfather [[Constantius Chlorus]] and [[Flavia Maximiana Theodora|Theodora]]) is unclear.&lt;ref&gt;X. Lucien-Brun, &quot;Constance II et le massacre des princes,&quot; ''Bulletin de l'[[Association Guillaume Budé]]'' ser. 4 (1973): 585–602; Joe W.

Constantius, his older brother [[Constantine II (emperor)|Constantine II]], his younger brother [[Constans]], and three cousins [[Constantius Gallus|Gallus]], [[Julian the Apostate|Julian]] and [[Nepotianus]] were left as the only surviving male relatives of Constantine the Great.

Meeting at Sirmium not long after the massacre, the three brothers proceeded to divide the Roman Empire among them, according to their father's will. Constantius received the eastern provinces, including [[Roman Egypt|Egypt]], [[Roman Syria|Syria]], [[Roman Thrace|Thrace]], and [[Asia Minor]]. Constantine II received [[Roman Britain|Britannia]], [[Roman Gaul|Gaul]], [[Hispania]], and [[Mauretania Tingitana|Mauretania]]. Constans, though initially under the supervision of Constantine II, received [[Italia (Roman Empire)|Italy]], [[Africa Province|Africa]], [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]], [[Pannonia]], [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Macedonia]], and [[Achaea (Roman province)|Achaea]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Zosimus]], ''New History'' II.57&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reign in the East==

There are few details of the early years of Constantius' sole reign in the eastern provinces. He spent most of his time defending the eastern border against invasions by the aggressive [[Sassanid Empire]] under king [[Shapur II]]. These conflicts were mainly limited to Sassanid sieges of the major fortresses of [[Roman Mesopotamia]], including [[Nisibis]] ([[Nusaybin]]), [[Singara]], and [[Diyarbakir|Amida]] ([[Diyarbakir]]). Although Shapur seems to have been victorious in most of the confrontations, the Sassanids were able to achieve little.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;&gt;[[Festus (historian)|Festus]], ''Brevarium'' XXVII&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dignas, B. 2007 p. 89&quot;&gt;Dignas, B. &amp; Winter, E., ''Rome and Persia in Late Antiquity'' (2007), p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Romans won a decisive victory at the '''Battle of Narasara''', killing Shapur's brother, Narses.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Theophanes the Confessor|Theophanes]], ''Chronicle'' A.M. 5815&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, Constantius was able to push back the invasion, Shapur failing to make any significant gains.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dignas, B. 2007 p. 89&quot;/&gt; Meanwhile, his brother Constantine desired to retain control of Constans' realm – leading Constantius' two brothers into open conflict. Constantine was killed in 340 near [[Aquileia]] during an ambush.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; As a result, Constans took control of his deceased brother’s realms and became sole ruler of the Western two-thirds of the empire. This division lasted until 350, when Constans was assassinated by forces loyal to the [[Roman usurper|usurper]] [[Magnentius]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Zosimus]] ''New History'' II.58-9&lt;/ref&gt;

===War against Magnentius===
[[File:Bronze coin of Contantius II 337 361 found in Karghalik.jpg|thumb|Bronze coin of Constantius II (337-361), found in [[Karghalik]], modern [[China]].]]

This new state of affairs was unacceptable to Constantius, who felt that as the only surviving son of [[Constantine the Great]], the position of [[Roman Emperor|emperor]] was his alone.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zosimus, New History II.60&quot;&gt;Zosimus, ''New History'' II.60&lt;/ref&gt; He was determined to march west across the empire to fight the usurper. However, feeling that the east still required some sort of imperial presence, he elevated his cousin [[Constantius Gallus]] to Caesar of the eastern provinces. As an extra measure to ensure the loyalty of his cousin, he married the elder of his two sisters, [[Constantina]], to him.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zosimus, New History II.60&quot;/&gt;

Before facing Magnentius, Constantius first came to terms with [[Vetranio]], a loyal general in [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]] who had recently been acclaimed emperor by his soldiers. Vetranio immediately sent letters to Constantius pledging his loyalty, which Constantius may have accepted simply in order to stop Magnentius from gaining more support. These events may have been spurred by the action of Constantina, who had since traveled east to marry Gallus. Constantius subsequently sent Vetranio the imperial diadem and acknowledged the general‘s new position as ''[[Augustus (title)|Augustus]]''. However, when Constantius arrived Vetranio willingly resigned his position and accepted Constantius’ offer of a comfortable retirement in [[Bithynia]].&lt;ref&gt;Zosimus, ''New History'' II.59&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Double Centenionalis Magnentius-XR-s4017.jpg|200px|thumb|left|The defeat of [[Magnentius]] in 353 left Constantius as sole [[Roman Emperor]].]]

The following year, Constantius clashed with Magnentius in [[Pannonia]] with a large army. The ensuing [[Battle of Mursa Major]] was one of the largest and most bloody battles between two Roman armies in Roman history.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joannes Zonaras|Zonaras]], ''Extracts of History'' XIII.8.5–13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Julian the Apostate]], ''The Caesars'' XLII.9–10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Zosimus]], ''New History'' II.46.2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Eutropius (historian)|Eutropius]], ''Roman History'' X.12&lt;/ref&gt; The result was a victory for Constantius, but a costly one. However, Magnentius himself managed to survive the battle and, determined to fight on, withdrew into northern Italy. Rather than pursuing his opponent, Constantius then turned his attention to securing the Danubian border, where he spent the early months of 352 campaigning against the [[Sarmatians]] along the middle [[Danube]]. After having achieved his aims in that region, Constantius finally advanced on Magnentius in Italy. This action leading the cities of Italy to switch their allegiance to him and eject Magnentius’ garrisons. Again, Magnentius withdrew, this time to southern [[Roman Gaul|Gaul]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Potter, D.S. 2004 p. 474&quot;&gt;Potter, D.S., ''The Roman Empire at Bay: AD 180–395'' (2004), p. 474&lt;/ref&gt;

In 353, Constantius and Magnentius met for what would be the final time at the [[Battle of Mons Seleucus]] in southern Gaul, and again, Constantius emerged the victor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Potter, D.S. 2004 p. 474&quot;/&gt; Soon after, Magnentius, realizing the futility of continuing his position, committed suicide on 10 August 353.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eutropius (historian)|Eutropius]], ''Historiae Romanae Breviarium'' X.12&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sole ruler of the empire==
Constantius spent much of the rest of 353 and early 354 on campaign against the [[Alamanni]] on the Danube frontier. The campaign was successful and raiding by the Alamanni ceased temporarily. In the meantime, Constantius had been receiving some disturbing reports regarding the actions of his cousin Gallus.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ammianus Marcellinus]], ''Res Gestae'' 14.1.10&lt;/ref&gt; Possibly as a result of these reports, Constantius concluded a peace with the Alamanni, and traveled to [[Mediolanum]] ([[Milan]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[Ammianus Marcellinus]], ''Res Gestae'' XIV.10.16&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Solidus-Constantius Gallus-thessalonica RIC 149.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Constantius Gallus was a paternal cousin of Constantius. In 350, he was made [[Caesar (title)|Caesar]] by Constantius and was married to the Emperor's sister, [[Constantina]]. However, his mismanagement of the eastern provinces led to his downfall and death in 354.]]

Once there, he decided to first call [[Ursicinus (Roman general)|Ursicinus]], Gallus’ ''magister equitum'', to Mediolanum for reasons that remain unclear.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ammianus Marcellinus]], ''Res Gestae'' XIV.11.3–5&lt;/ref&gt; Constantius then requested the presence of Gallus and Constantina.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;&gt;[[Ammianus Marcellinus]], ''Res Gestae'' XIV.11.6&lt;/ref&gt; Although at first Gallus and Constantina complied with the order, when Constantina died in [[Bithynia]],&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;/&gt; Gallus began to hesitate. However, after some convincing by one of Constantius’ agents,&lt;ref&gt;[[Ammianus Marcellinus]], ''Res Gestae'' XIV.11.11–12&lt;/ref&gt; Gallus continued his journey west, passing through [[Constantinople]] and [[Thracia (Roman province)|Thrace]] to [[Poetovio]] ([[Ptuj]]) in [[Pannonia]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Ammianus Marcellinus]], ''Res Gestae'' XIV.11.19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;roman-emperors.org&quot;&gt;[http://www.roman-emperors.org/gallus.htm Banchich, T.M., 'DIR-Gallus' from De Imperatoribus Romanis]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Poetovio, Gallus was arrested by the soldiers of Constantius under the command of [[Barbatio]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Ammianus Marcellinus]], ''Res Gestae'' XIV.11.20&lt;/ref&gt; He was then moved to [[Pula|Pola]], and interrogated. Once there, Gallus claimed that it was Constantina who was to blame for all the trouble that had been caused while he was in charge of the eastern provinces.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ammianus Marcellinus]], ''Res Gestae'' XIV.11.22&lt;/ref&gt; At first, this so greatly angered Constantius that he immediately ordered Gallus' execution.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ammianus Marcellinus]], ''Res Gestae'' XIV.11.23&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after however, he changed his mind and recanted his order.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joannes Zonaras|Zonaras]], ''Extracts of History'' XIII.9.20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Libanius]], ''Orations'' XVIII.152&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately for Gallus, this order was delayed by [[Eusebius (praepositus sacri cubiculi)|Eusebius]], one of Constantius‘ eunuchs, and as a result Gallus was executed.&lt;ref name=&quot;roman-emperors.org&quot;/&gt;

===More usurpers and Julian===
On 11 August 355, the [[magister militum]] [[Claudius Silvanus]] revolted in Gaul. Silvanus had surrendered to Constantius after the [[Battle of Mursa Major]]. Constantius had made him magister militum in 353, with the purpose of blocking the German threats, a feat that Silvanus achieved by bribing the German tribes with the money he had collected. A plot organized by members of Constantius' court led the emperor to recall Silvanus. After Silvanus revolted, he received a letter by Constantius that recalled him to Milan, but which made no reference to the revolt. [[Ursicinus (Roman general)|Ursicinus]], who was meant to replace Silvanus, bribed some troops, and Silvanus was killed.

However, Constantius realised that too many threats still faced the Empire, and he could not possibly handle all of them by himself, so on 6 November 355,&lt;ref&gt;[[Ammianus Marcellinus]], ''Res Gestae'' XV.8.17&lt;/ref&gt; he elevated his last remaining relative, Julian, to the rank of [[Caesar (title)|Caesar]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Ammianus Marcellinus]], ''Res Gestae'' XV.8.5–16&lt;/ref&gt; A few days later, [[Julian the Apostate|Julian]] was married to [[Helena, wife of Julian|Helena]], the last surviving sister of Constantius.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ammianus Marcellinus]], ''Res Gestae'' XV.8.18&lt;/ref&gt; Not long after Constantius sent [[Julian the Apostate|Julian]] off to Gaul.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ammianus Marcellinus]], ''Res Gestae'' XV.8.18&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:07 constantius2Chrono354.png|thumb|right|300px|Constantius II depicted in the [[Chronography of 354]] dispensing largesse (a [[Renaissance]] copy of a [[Carolingian]] copy).]]
Constantius spent the next few years overseeing affairs in the western part of the empire primarily from his base at Mediolanum. In 357 he visited [[Rome]] for the first and only time in his life. The same year he forced [[Sarmatians|Sarmatian]] and [[Quadi]] invaders out of Pannonia and [[Moesia|Moesia Inferior]], then subsequently led a successful counter-attack across the Danube against the enemy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ammianus Marcellinus]], ''Res Gestae'' XVI.12&lt;/ref&gt;

In the winter of 357-8, Constantius received ambassadors from [[Shapur II]] who demanded that Rome restore the lands surrendered by [[Narseh]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Ammianus Marcellinus]], ''Res Gestae'' XVII.5.3–8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Joannes Zonaras|Zonaras]], ''Extracts of History'' XII.9.25-7&lt;/ref&gt; Despite rejecting these terms,&lt;ref&gt;[[Ammianus Marcellinus]], ''Res Gestae'' XVII.5.9–14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Joannes Zonaras|Zonaras]], ''Extracts of History'' XII.9.28-9&lt;/ref&gt; Constantius still tried to avert war with the [[Sassanid Empire]] by sending two embassies to [[Shapur II]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Libanius]], ''Epistle'' 331&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ammianus Marcellinus]], ''Res Gestae'' XVII.14.1–3 &amp; XVIII.6.17-8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Eunapius]], ''Lives of the Sophists'' VI. 5.1–10&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of Constantius' rejection of his terms, [[Shapur II]] launched another invasion of Roman Mesopotamia. In 360, when news reached Constantius that [[Shapur II]] had destroyed [[Singara]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Ammianus Marcellinus]], ''Res Gestae'' XX.6&lt;/ref&gt; and taken [[Hasankeyf|Kiphas]] ([[Hasankeyf]]),
[[Diyarbakır|Amida]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Ammianus Marcellinus]], ''Res Gestae'' XIX&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Cizre|Ad Tigris]] ([[Cizre]]),&lt;ref&gt;[[Ammianus Marcellinus]], ''Res Gestae'' XX.7.1–16&lt;/ref&gt; he decided to travel east to face the re-emergent threat.

===Usurpation of Julian and crises in the east===
In the meantime, Julian had won some victories against the [[Alamanni|Alemanni]] tribe, who had once again invaded [[Roman Gaul]]. However, when Constantius requested reinforcements from Julian’s army for the eastern campaign, the Gallic legions revolted and proclaimed Julian Augustus.&lt;ref&gt;[[Julian the Apostate]], ''Letter To The Senate And People of Athens'', X.12–17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Libanius]], ''Orations'' XII.58 &amp; XVIII.90-1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Eutropius (historian)|Eutropius]], ''Historiae Romanae Breviarium'' X.15.1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ammianus Marcellinus]], ''Res Gestae'' XX.4.1–2&lt;/ref&gt;

However, on account of the immediate Sassanid threat, Constantius was unable to directly respond to his cousin’s usurpation other than by sending missives by which he tried to convince Julian to resign the title of Augustus and be satisfied with that of Caesar. By 361, Constantius saw no alternative but to face the usurper with force; and yet the threat of the [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanids]] remained. Constantius had already spent part of early 361 unsuccessfully attempting to re-take the fortress of Ad Tigris.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ammianus Marcellinus]], ''Res Gestae'' XX.11.6–25&lt;/ref&gt; After a time he had withdrawn to [[Antioch]] to regroup and prepare for a confrontation with [[Shapur II]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Ammianus Marcellinus]], ''Res Gestae'' XXI.7.7 &amp; 13.1–5&lt;/ref&gt; However, the campaigns of the previous year had inflicted heavy losses on the Sassanids and they did not attempt another round of campaigns that year. This temporary respite in hostilities allowed Constantius to turn his full attention to facing Julian.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vagi, D.L. 2001 p. 508&quot;&gt;Vagi, D.L. &amp; Coquand, T., ''Coinage and History of the Roman Empire'' (2001), p. 508&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Constantius immediately gathered his forces and set off west. However, by the time he reached [[Mopsuestia]] in Cilicia, it was clear that he was fatally ill and would not survive to face Julian. Apparently, realising his death was near, Constantius had himself baptised by [[Arianism|Euzoius]], the [[Semi-Arianism|Semi-Arian]] bishop of [[Antioch]], and then declared that Julian was his rightful successor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vagi, D.L. 2001 p. 508&quot;/&gt; Constantius II died of fever on 3 November 361.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ammianus Marcellinus]], ''Res Gestae'' XXI.15.2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriages and children==
Constantius II was married three times:

First to a [[Daughter of Julius Constantius|daughter]] of his half-uncle [[Julius Constantius]], whose name is unknown. She was a full-sister of Gallus and a half-sister of Julian. She died c. 352/3.

Second, to Eusebia, a woman of [[Ancient Macedonians|Macedonian]] origin from the city of [[Thessaloniki]], whom Constantius married before his defeat of Magnentius in 353. She died in 360.

Third and lastly, in 360, to [[Faustina (empress)|Faustina]], who gave birth to Constantius' only child, a posthumous daughter named [[Flavia Maxima Constantia]], who later married Emperor [[Gratian]].

==Religious issues==
Constantius seems to have had a particular interest in the religious state of the [[Roman Empire]]. As a [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Roman Emperor]], Constantius made a concerted effort to promote [[Christianity]] at the expense of [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman polytheism]] (‘paganism’). As such, over the course of his reign, he issued a number of different edicts designed specifically to carry out this agenda (see below). Constantius also took an active part in attempting to shape the [[Christianity|Christian]] church.

===Paganism===
In spite of the some of the edicts issued by Constantius, it should be recognised that he was not fanatically anti-pagan – he never made any attempt to disband the various Roman priestly colleges or the [[Vestal Virgin]]s,&lt;ref name=&quot;Vasiliev, A.A 1958 p. 68&quot;&gt;Vasiliev, A.A, ''History of the Byzantine Empire 324–1453'' (1958), p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; he never acted against the various pagan schools, and, at times, he actually made some effort to protect paganism. In fact, he even ordered the election of a priest for Africa.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vasiliev, A.A 1958 p. 68&quot;/&gt; Also, he remained [[pontifex maximus]] until his death, and was deified by the Roman Senate after his death. The relative moderation of Constantius' actions toward paganism is reflected by the fact that it was not until over 20 years after Constantius' death, during the reign of [[Gratian]], that any pagan senators protested their religion's treatment.&lt;ref&gt;Salzman, M.R., ''The Making of a Christian Aristocracy: Social and Religious Change in the Western Roman Empire'' (2002), p. 182&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pagan-related edicts''' issued by Constantius (by himself or with others) included:
* The banning of sacrifices;&lt;ref&gt;[[Codex Theodosianus]] 16.10.2 &amp; 16.10.6&lt;/ref&gt;
* The closing of pagan temples;&lt;ref&gt;[[Codex Theodosianus]] 16.10.4 &amp; 16.10.6&lt;/ref&gt;
* Edicts against soothsayers and magicians.&lt;ref&gt;[[Codex Theodosianus]] 9.16.4, 9.16.5 &amp; 9.16.6&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christianity===
Although often considered an [[Arianism|Arian]],&lt;ref&gt;Jones, A.H.M, ''The Later Roman Empire, 284–602: a Social, Economic and Administrative Survey'' (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University, 1986), p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; Constantius ultimately preferred a third, compromise version that lay somewhere in between [[Arianism]] and the [[Nicene Creed]], retrospectively called [[Semi-Arianism]].&lt;ref&gt;Pelikan, J.J., ''The Christian Tradition'' (1989), pp. 209–10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gaddis, M., ''There is No Crime for Those who Have Christ'' (2005), p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; As such, during his reign, Constantius made a concerted attempt to mold the Christian church to follow this compromise position, and to this end, he convened several Christian councils during his reign, the most notable of which were one at [[Council of Rimini|Rimini]] and its twin at [[Silifke|Seleuca]], which met in 359 and 360 respectively. &quot;Unfortunately for his memory the theologians whose advice he took were ultimately discredited and the malcontents whom he pressed to conform emerged victorious,&quot; writes the historian [[A.H.M. Jones]]. &quot;The great councils of 359–60 are therefore not reckoned [[Ecumenical council|ecumenical]] in the tradition of the church, and Constantius II is not remembered as a restorer of unity, but as a [[Arianism|heretic]] who arbitrarily imposed his will on the church.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Jones, A.H.M 1986 p. 118&quot;&gt;Jones, A.H.M, ''The Later Roman Empire, 284–602: a Social, Economic and Administrative Survey'' (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University, 1986), p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Christian-related edicts''' issued by Constantius (by himself or with others) included:
* Exemption from compulsory public service for the clergy;&lt;ref&gt;[[Codex Theodosianus]] 16.2.9&lt;/ref&gt;
* Exemption from compulsory public service for the sons of clergy;&lt;ref&gt;[[Codex Theodosianus]] 16.2.11&lt;/ref&gt;
* Tax exemptions for clergy and their servants,&lt;ref&gt;[[Codex Theodosianus]] 16.2.8&lt;/ref&gt; and later for their family;&lt;ref&gt;[[Codex Theodosianus]] 16.2.14&lt;/ref&gt;
* Clergy and the issue of private property;&lt;ref&gt;[[Codex Theodosianus]] 16.2.15, 12.1.49 &amp; 8.4.7&lt;/ref&gt;
* Bishops exempted from being tried in secular courts;&lt;ref&gt;[[Codex Theodosianus]] 16.2.12&lt;/ref&gt;
* Christian prostitutes only able to be bought by Christians.&lt;ref&gt;[[Codex Theodosianus]] 15.8.1&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judaism===
Judaism faced some severe restrictions under Constantius, who seems to have followed an anti-Jewish policy in line with that of his father.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schäfer, P. 2003 pp. 180-1&quot;&gt;Schäfer, P., ''The History of the Jews in the Greco-Roman World'' (2003), pp. 180–1&lt;/ref&gt; Early in his reign, Constantius issued a double edict in concert with his brothers limiting the ownership of slaves by Jewish people&lt;ref name=&quot;Codex Theodosianus 16.9.2&quot;&gt;[[Codex Theodosianus]] 16.9.2&lt;/ref&gt; and banning marriages between Jews and Christian women.&lt;ref name=&quot;Codex Theodosianus 16.9.2&quot;/&gt; A later edict issued by Constantius after becoming sole emperor decreed that a person who was proven to have converted from Christianity to Judaism would have their entire property confiscated by the state.&lt;ref name=&quot;Codex Theodosianus 16.8.7&quot;&gt;[[Codex Theodosianus]] 16.8.7&lt;/ref&gt; However, it should be noted that Constantius' actions in this regard may not have been so much to do with Jewish religion as Jewish business; apparently, it was often the case that privately-owned Jewish businesses were in competition with state-owned businesses. As such, Constantius may have sought to provide as much of an advantage to the state-owned businesses as possible by limiting the skilled workers and the slaves available to the Jewish businesses.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schäfer, P. 2003 pp. 180-1&quot;/&gt;

'''Jew-related edicts''' issued by Constantius (by himself or with others) included:
* Weaving women who moved from working for the government to working for Jews, must be restored to the government; Jews may not marry Christian women; Jews may not attempt to convert Christian women;&lt;ref name=&quot;Codex Theodosianus 16.9.2&quot;/&gt;
* Any non-Jewish slave bought by a Jew will be confiscated by the state; if a Jew attempts to circumcise a non-Jewish slave, the slave will be freed and the Jew shall face capital punishment; any Christian slaves owned by a Jew will be taken away and freed;&lt;ref name=&quot;Codex Theodosianus 16.9.2&quot;/&gt;
* A person who is proven to have converted from Christianity to Judaism shall have their property confiscated by the state.&lt;ref name=&quot;Codex Theodosianus 16.8.7&quot;/&gt;

==Reputation==
Constantius II is a particularly difficult figure to judge properly, mainly as a result of the hostility of most sources that mentions him. A.H.M Jones writes that Constantius &quot;appears in the pages of [[Ammianus Marcellinus|Ammianus]] as a conscientious emperor but a vain and stupid man, an easy prey to flatterers. He was timid and suspicious, and interested persons could easily play on his fears for their own advantage.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Jones, A.H.M., ''Later Roman Empire'', p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Kent &amp; M. and A. Hirmer suggest that Constantius &quot;has suffered at the hands of unsympathetic authors, ecclesiastical and civil alike. To orthodox churchmen he was a bigoted supporter of the Arian heresy, to Julian the Apostate and the many who have subsequently taken his part he was a murderer, a tyrant and inept as a ruler&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kent, J.P.C. 1978 p. 54&quot;&gt;Kent, J.P.C., Hirmer, M. &amp; Hirmer, A. ''Roman Coins'' (1978), p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; They go on to add, &quot;Most contemporaries seem in fact to have held him in high esteem, and he certainly inspired loyalty in a way his brother could not&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kent, J.P.C. 1978 p. 54&quot;/&gt; In the military sphere, the campaigns of Constantius and his subordinates on the Rhine and Danube frontiers in the late 350s restored stability to those regions after the troubles caused by Magnentius' revolt.

'''Constans''' ({{lang-la|Flavius Julius Constans Augustus}})&lt;ref name=&quot;Jones, pg. 220&quot;&gt;Jones, pg. 220&lt;/ref&gt; (c.323&lt;ref name=&quot;Jones, pg. 220&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Victor, 41:23&lt;/ref&gt;–350), was [[Roman Emperor]] from 337 to 350. He defeated his brother [[Constantine II (emperor)|Constantine II]] in 340, but anger in the army over his personal life and preference for his barbarian bodyguards saw the general [[Magnentius]] rebel, resulting in Constans’ assassination in 350.

Constans was the third and youngest son of [[Constantine the Great]] and [[Fausta]], his father's second wife.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;DiMaio, ''Constans I (337–350 A.D.)''&lt;/ref&gt;  He was educated at the court of his father at [[Constantinople]] under the tutelage of the poet [[Aemilius Magnus Arborius]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Jones, pg. 220&quot;/&gt; 

On 25 December 333, Constantine I elevated Constans to the rank of ''[[Caesar (title)|Caesar]]'' at [[Constantinople]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Jones, pg. 220&quot;/&gt;  Prior to 337, Constans became engaged to Olympias, the daughter of the [[Praetorian Prefect]] Ablabius, although the marriage never came to pass.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;  With Constantine’s death in 337, Constans and his two brothers, [[Constantine II (emperor)|Constantine II]] and [[Constantius II]] divided the Roman world between themselves,&lt;ref name=&quot;Eutropius, 10:9&quot;&gt;Eutropius, 10:9&lt;/ref&gt; after first disposing of virtually all of the relatives of their father who could possibly have a claim on the throne.&lt;ref name=&quot;Victor, 41:20&quot;&gt;Victor, 41:20&lt;/ref&gt; The army proclaimed them ''[[Augustus (title)|Augusti]]'' on September 9, 337.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jones, pg. 220&quot;/&gt; Almost immediately, Constans was required to deal with a [[Sarmatian]] invasion in late 337, over whom he won a resounding victory.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Impero Romano da maggio a settembre 337.png|thumb|left|Division of the Roman Empire among the Caesars appointed by [[Constantine I]]: from left to right, the territories of [[Constantine II (emperor)|Constantine II]], Constans, [[Dalmatius]] and [[Constantius II]]. After the death of Constantine I (May 337), this was the formal division of the Empire, until Dalmatius was killed and his territory divided between Constans and Constantius.]]
At first, Constans was under the guardianship of Constantine II, and the original settlement saw Constans receiving the [[praetorian prefectures]] of [[praetorian prefecture of Italy|Italy and Africa]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Canduci, pg. 130&quot;&gt;Canduci, pg. 130&lt;/ref&gt;  Constans was unhappy with this division, and so the brothers met at [[Viminacium]] in 338 to revise the boundaries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Canduci, pg. 130&quot;/&gt;  Constans managed to extract the prefecture of [[Praetorian prefecture of Illyricum|Illyricum]] and the [[diocese of Thrace]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Canduci, pg. 130&quot;/&gt; provinces that were originally part of what was meant to be ruled by his cousin [[Dalmatius]] as per Constantine I’s proposed division of the empire after his death.&lt;ref name=&quot;Victor, 41:20&quot;/&gt;  Constans’ brother, Constantine II, soon complained that he had not received the amount of territory that was his due, stemming from his position as the eldest of Constantine’s sons.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gibbon, Ch. 18&quot;&gt;Gibbon, Ch. 18&lt;/ref&gt;  Annoyed that Constans had received Thrace and [[Diocese of Macedonia|Macedonia]] after the death of Dalmatius, Constantine demanded that Constans hand over the African provinces, which, in order to maintain a fragile peace, he agreed to do.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gibbon, Ch. 18&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Victor, 41:21&quot;&gt;Victor, 41:21&lt;/ref&gt;  Soon however, they began quarrelling over which parts of the African provinces belonged to [[Carthage]], and thus Constantine, and that which belonged it [[Italy]], and therefore Constans.&lt;ref&gt;Zosimus, 2:41-42&lt;/ref&gt;  This led to growing tensions between the two brothers, which were only heightened by Constans finally coming of age and Constantine refusing to give up his guardianship. The end result was that in 340, Constantine II invaded Italy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Victor, 41:21&quot;/&gt;  Constans, at that time in [[Dacia]], detached and sent a select and disciplined body of his Illyrian troops, stating that he would follow them in person with the remainder of his forces.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gibbon, Ch. 18&quot;/&gt;  Constantine was eventually trapped at [[Aquileia]], where he died, leaving Constans to inherit all of his brother’s former territories – [[Hispania]], [[Roman Britain|Britannia]] and [[Roman Gaul|Gaul]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Eutropius, 10:9&quot;/&gt;

According to the sources, Constans began his reign in an energetic fashion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eutropius, 10:9&quot;/&gt;  In 341-2, Constans led a successful campaign against the [[Franks]] and in the early months of 343 visited [[Roman Britain|Britain]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; The source for this visit, [[Julius Firmicus Maternus]], does not give a reason for this but the quick movement and the danger involved in  crossing the [[English Channel|channel]] in the dangerous winter months, suggests it was in response to a military emergency of some kind, possibly to repel the [[Picts]] and [[Gaels|Scots]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

Regarding religion, Constans was tolerant of Judaism but promulgated an edict banning pagan sacrifices in 341.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;  He suppressed [[Donatism]] in Africa and supported [[Nicene Christianity|Nicene orthodoxy]] against [[Arianism]], which was championed by his brother Constantius. Although Constans called the [[Council of Sardica]] in 343 to settle the conflict,&lt;ref&gt;Socrates Scholasticus, ''Church History'', book 2, chapter 20.&lt;/ref&gt; it was a complete failure&lt;ref&gt;Catholic Encyclopedia, 1930, Patrick J. Healy, Sardica&lt;/ref&gt; and by 346 the two emperors were on the point of open warfare over the creedal dispute.&lt;ref name=&quot;Canduci, pg. 131&quot;&gt;Canduci, pg. 131&lt;/ref&gt;  The conflict was only resolved with an interim agreement that allowed each emperor to support their preferred clergy within their own spheres of influence.&lt;ref name=&quot;Canduci, pg. 131&quot;/&gt;

==Death==
In the final years of his reign, Constans developed a reputation for cruelty and misrule.&lt;ref&gt;Zosimus, 2:42&lt;/ref&gt;  Dominated by favourites, offended by his homosexuality&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Canduci, pg. 131&quot;/&gt; and openly favouring his select bodyguard, he lost the support of the legions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gibbon, Ch. 18&quot;/&gt;  In 350, the general [[Magnentius]] declared himself emperor at [[Augustodunum]] with the support of the troops on the [[Rhine]] frontier - and later the western provinces of the empire.&lt;ref&gt;Eutropius, 10:9:4&lt;/ref&gt;  Constans was enjoying himself nearby when he was notified of the elevation of Magnentius.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gibbon, Ch. 18&quot;/&gt;  Lacking any support beyond his immediate household,&lt;ref name=&quot;Gibbon, Ch. 18&quot;/&gt; he was forced to flee for his life. Trying to reach either Italy or Spain, Magnentius' supporters cornered him in a fortification in [[Vicus Helena]] in the [[Pyrenees]], southwestern [[Roman Gaul|Gaul]],&lt;ref&gt;Victor, 41:21:23&lt;/ref&gt; where he was killed by Magnentius' assassins after seeking sanctuary in a temple.&lt;ref name=&quot;Canduci, pg. 131&quot;/&gt;

'''Cheerleading''' is a [[physical activity]], sometimes a competitive [[sport]], based on organized routines, usually ranging from one to three minutes, which contain the components of [[Tumbling (gymnastics)|tumbling]], [[dance]], [[List of cheerleading jumps|jumps]], [[cheering|cheers]], and [[List of cheerleading stunts|stunting]] to direct spectators of events to cheer on sports teams at games or to participate in competitions. The athlete involved is called a '''cheerleader'''. Cheerleading originated in the United States, and remains a predominantly American activity, with an estimated 1.5 million participants in all-star cheerleading. The growing presentation of cheerleading as a sport to a global audience has been led by the 1997 start of broadcasts of cheerleading competition by [[ESPN]] International and the worldwide release of the 2000 film ''[[Bring It On (film)|Bring it On]]''. Due in part to this recent exposure, there are now an estimated 100,000 participants scattered around the rest of the world in countries including Australia, Canada, China, Colombia, Finland, France, Germany, Japan,&lt;ref&gt;http://fjca.jp/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;japancheer&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last = Japan Echo, Inc | title=Three Cheers for the Champions! | work= Web Japan| date =2005-05-30 | url=http://web-japan.org/trends/sports/spo050530.html | accessdate=2007-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Netherlands, New Zealand and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name=&quot;nw20007&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Campo-Flores| first=Arian |title=A World of Cheer! |journal=[[Newsweek]] |date=2007-05-14 |url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/34924 |accessdate=2007-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:JCampbell.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Minnesota Golden Gophers Spirit Squads|Minnesota Gopher]] cheerleader Johnny Campbell]]
Princeton graduate [[Thomas Peebles]] introduced the idea of organized crowds cheering at football games to the [[Minnesota Golden Gophers Spirit Squads|University of Minnesota]]. However, it was not until 1898 that [[Minnesota Golden Gophers Spirit Squads|University of Minnesota]] student Johnny Campbell directed a crowd in cheering &quot;Rah, Rah, Rah! Ski-u-mah, Hoo-Rah! Hoo-Rah! Varsity! Varsity! Varsity, Minn-e-So-Tah!”, making Campbell the very first cheerleader and November 2, 1898 the official birth date of organized cheerleading. Soon after, the [[Minnesota Golden Gophers Spirit Squads|University of Minnesota]] organized a &quot;yell leader&quot; squad of 6 male students, who still use Campbell's original cheer.&lt;ref name=&quot;ICFHandbook&quot;&gt;{{Cite book | last=Neil | first=Randy L. | last2=Hart | first2 =Elaine | title=The Official Cheerleader's Handbook | publisher =[[Simon &amp; Schuster]] | year =1986 | edition =Revised Fireside Edition 1986 | isbn =0-671-61210-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1903 the first cheerleading [[fraternities and sororities|fraternity]], Gamma Sigma was founded.&lt;ref name=&quot;ACFeb2003&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Walker | first=Marisa | title=Cheer Milestones | journal=American Cheerleader | volume= 11 | issue=1 | pages=41–43 | date=February 2005 | id = ISSN 1079-9885 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cheerleading started out as an all-male activity, but females began participating in 1923, due to limited availability of female collegiate sports and men being drafted for war. At this time, gymnastics, tumbling, and [[megaphone]]s were incorporated into popular cheers, and are still used.&lt;ref name=&quot;ACFeb2003&quot;/&gt;  It is estimated that 97% of cheerleading participants overall are female, but males still make up 50% of cheering squads at the collegiate level.&lt;ref name=&quot;popwarner&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last=Balthaser | first=Joel D. | title=Cheerleading – Oh How far it has come! | publisher=[[Pop Warner Little Scholars|Pop Warner]] | date=2005-01-06 | url=http://www.popwarner.com/articles/phenomenon.asp | accessdate=2007-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:PostcardCornellUniversityCheerleader1906.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Cornell University]] cheerleader on a 1906 postcard]]

In 1948, Lawrence &quot;Herkie&quot; Herkimer, of Dallas, TX and a former cheerleader at [[Southern Methodist University]] formed the National Cheerleaders Association (NCA) as a way to hold cheerleading clinics. In 1949, The NCA held its first clinic in Huntsville, TX with 52 girls in attendance.&lt;ref name=&quot;popwarner&quot;/&gt; Herkimer contributed many firsts to the sport: the founding of the Cheerleader &amp; Danz Team [[cheerleading uniform]] supply company, inventing the [[herkie]], (where one leg is bent towards the ground and the other is out to the side as high as it will stretch in the toe-touch position)&lt;ref name=&quot;cheerleading.about&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Cheerleading Jump Herkie | url=http://cheerleading.about.com/cs/jumps/g/herkie.htm | accessdate=2007-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and creating the &quot;Spirit Stick&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ACFeb2003&quot;/&gt; By the 1960s, college cheerleaders began hosting workshops across the nation, teaching fundamental cheer skills to eager high-school-age girls. In 1965, Fred Gastoff invented the vinyl [[pom-pon]] and it was introduced into competitions by the International Cheerleading Foundation (now the World Cheerleading Association or WCA). Organized cheerleading competitions began to pop up with the first ranking of the &quot;Top Ten College Cheerleading Squads&quot; and &quot;Cheerleader All America&quot; awards given out by the International Cheerleading Foundation in 1967.  In 1978, America was introduced to competitive cheerleading by the first broadcast of [[Collegiate Cheerleading Championships]] on [[CBS]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ICFHandbook&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ACFeb2003&quot;/&gt;

In the 1960s [[National Football League]] (NFL) teams began to organize professional cheerleading teams.  The [[Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders]] soon gained the spotlight with their revealing outfits and sophisticated dance moves, which debuted in the 1972–1973 season, but were first seen widely in [[Super Bowl X]] (1976). This caused the image of cheerleaders to permanently change, with many other NFL teams emulating them.  Most of the professional teams' cheerleading squads would more accurately be described as dance teams by contemporary standards; as they rarely, if ever, actively encourage crowd noise or perform modern cheerleading moves.

The 1980s saw the onset of modern cheerleading with more difficult stunt sequences and gymnastics being incorporated into routines. All-star teams started to pop up, and with them the creation of the United States All-Star Federation (USASF) ESPN first broadcasted the National High School Cheerleading Competition nationwide in 1983. Cheerleading organizations such as the American Association of Cheerleading Coaches and Advisors (AACCA), founded in 1987, started applying universal safety standards to decrease the number of injuries and prevent dangerous stunts, pyramids and tumbling passes from being included in routines.&lt;ref name=&quot;AACCA&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=About the AACCA | url=http://www.aacca.org/about.asp | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061206110741/http://www.aacca.org/about.asp | archivedate=2006-12-06 | accessdate=2007-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, the National Council for Spirit Safety and Education (NCSSE) was formed to offer safety training for youth, school, all star and college coaches. The NCAA requires college cheer coaches to successfully complete a nationally recognized safety-training program. The NCSSE or AACCA certification programs are both recognized by the NCAA.

Even with its athletic and competitive development, cheerleading at the school level has retained its ties to the spirit leading traditions started back in the 1890s. Cheerleaders are seen as ambassadors for their schools, and leaders among the student body. At the college level, cheerleaders are often invited to help at university fundraisers.

Cheerleading is currently most closely associated with [[American football]] and [[basketball]]. Sports such as [[association football]] (soccer), [[ice hockey]], [[volleyball]], [[baseball]], and [[wrestling]] sometimes sponsor cheerleading squads. The ICC Twenty20 Cricket World Cup in South Africa in 2007 was the first international cricket event to have cheerleaders. The [[Florida Marlins]] were the first [[Major League Baseball]] team to have cheerleaders. Debuting in 2003, the &quot;Marlin Mermaids&quot; gained national exposure and have influenced other MLB teams to develop their own cheer/dance squads{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}.

==Types of teams in the world today==
=== School-sponsored ===
[[File:Georgia Tech cheerleaders 2006.jpg|thumb|right|200px| Collegiate cheerleaders at a [[college basketball]] game.]]
Most American middle schools, high schools, and colleges have organized cheerleading squads made up solely of students. Several colleges that compete at cheerleading competitions offer cheerleading scholarships. School-sponsored cheerleading promotes school spirit and motivate the players and fans. A cheerleading team may compete outside of sporting events (local, regional, and national competitions), and cheer for sporting events and encourage audience participation. Cheerleading is quickly becoming a year-round sport, starting with tryouts during the spring of the preceding school year, organized camp as a team, practices, attendance at various sporting events and ending with National competition season, typically from winter through spring.

School cheerleaders also compete with rec-style routines at many competitions year-round. They practice hard for them and come up with a 2 minute 30 second routine to show off at the competitions. Like other school-level athletes they compete to win their league title and  move on to bigger competitions eventually reaching nationals the ultimate title for a school squad.  The advantages to a school squad versus an all-star squad is cheering at various games. For some squads the level of competition on the weekends can equal that of an all-star squad.

The tryout process sometimes takes place over many days. The cheerleading coach usually arranges for a cheerleading clinic, during which basic materials are taught or reviewed before the final day of tryouts. The clinic gives returning cheerleaders and new cheerleaders an equal chance of becoming familiar with the material. Skills that coaches look for include jumps, tumbling, motions, and dance ability. Tryouts are usually in the spring, so that the coach has the team chosen in time to attend summer camp as a team.

====Middle school cheerleading====
[[Middle school]] cheerleading evolved shortly after high school squads started. In middle school, the squads serve mostly the same functions as high school squads and follow the same rules and regulations. Depending on how advanced the squad is, they usually do similar stunts as a high school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wcpss.net/athletics/middle_school/cheerleading.pdf |title=WCPSS.net |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The cheerleaders cheer at basketball, football, and other sports in their school. They also perform at pep rallies and compete against other schools from local competitions all the way to nationals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mmscheer.com/ |title=Martin Middle School Cheerleading Squad (4 Time National Champions) |publisher=Mmscheer.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cheerleading in middle school sometimes can be a two-season sport, fall and winter. However many middle school cheer squads will go all year round like high school squads. Middle school cheerleaders use the same cheerleading movements as their older counterparts, but perform less extreme stunts, ranging from simple elevators, knee stands, extensions to harder stunts such as the heel stretch and scorpion.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

====High school cheerleading====

In high school, there are usually two squads per school, [[varsity team]] and a [[junior varsity team]]. Some schools also include a freshman level of the sport in order to develop skills as the athletes mature. High school cheerleading contains aspects of school spirit as well as competition. These squads have become a part of a year-round sport, starting with tryouts in the spring, to year-round practice, to sporting events to cheer at in the [[fall]] and [[winter]], and to cheerleading competitions. Most teams practice at least three days a week for about two hours each practice during the summer. Many teams also attend separate tumbling sessions outside of practice. During the school year, cheerleading is usually a five- to six-days-a-week sport. During competition season it often becomes seven days with practice twice a day sometimes. The school spirit aspect of cheerleading involves cheering, supporting, and &quot;pumping up&quot; the crowd at football games, basketball games, and even wrestling meets. With this they also make posters, perform at pep rallies, and bring school spirit to the other students. In May 2009, the [[National Federation of State High School Associations]] released the results of their first true high school participation study. They estimated that the number of high school cheerleaders from public high schools is 394,694.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nfhs.org/web/2009/05/survey_indicates_nearly_400000.aspx NFHS.org]{{Dead link|date=May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Flick-Gator Cheerleaders.jpg|right|150px|thumb|Collegiate cheerleaders perform a high splits pyramid during a college [[American football|football]] game]]
Its competition aspect makes cheerleading its own sport. There is year-round practice, cheer camps, and competitions throughout the winter. There are different cheerleading organizations that put on these competitions, some of the major ones include state competitions and regional competitions. Many high schools host cheerleading competitions, bringing in IHSA judges. The regional competitions are the qualifiers for the national competitions, such as the [http://www.uca.varsity.com/ UCA (Universal Cheerleaders Association)] in [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]], [[Florida]] every year.&lt;ref&gt;Universal Cheerleaders Association (UCA) 2008. 7 December 2008. [http://uca.varsity.com Varsity.com]&lt;/ref&gt; The competition aspect of cheerleading can be very enduring; styles and rules changing every year make it important and difficult to find the newest and hottest routines.&lt;ref&gt;AACCA American Association of Cheerleading Coaches and Administrators. 2008. 7 December 2008. [http://www.aacca.org/ AACCA.org]&lt;/ref&gt; Most teams have a professional choreograph their routine in order to ensure they are not breaking any rules and they will be up to par with the other teams. For a list of rules visit [http://www.aacca.org/ AACCA (American Association of Cheerleading Coaches and Administrators)]. All high school coaches are required to attend an IHSA rules meeting at the beginning of the season. This ensures their knowledge of rules changes and their compliance with these rules. Routines usually last around 2 minutes and 30 seconds and require cheer, dance, jumps, tumbling, and stunting portions.

Not all high school cheerleading squads compete in competitions, but all support their schools. Cheerleaders also dress in matching uniforms. They do this to look &quot;together&quot; and like a team when performing.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;2008 Sun Prairie Coed ESPN Performance.&quot; YouTube. 2008. 7 December 2008. [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y4jFwmIwhY Youtube.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

====College cheerleading====
Most colleges and universities have a cheerleading squad. Most squads are coed (consisting of both men and women), but all-girl college squads are growing in rapid numbers in an effort to give female cheerleaders (especially female bases) who have cheered on an all-girl high school or all-star squads an opportunity to cheer at the collegiate level without making the transition to a coed squad. Unlike high school cheerleading, college squads can perform difficult stunts like rewinds, 2½ high pyramids, and flipping and twisting [[basket toss]]es. Most college squads compete at some level, and a handful of them compete nationally.

Many organizations that sponsor youth league [[American football|football]] or [[basketball]] sponsor cheerleading squads as well.  [[Pop Warner Little Scholars|Pop Warner]] and PPAL [pasco police athletic league] organizations are an example of this.  The [[YMCA]] (Young Men's Christian Association) is also a popular sponsor for youth cheerleading leagues, as well as numerous other sports leagues.  Many local communities are creating organizations to go along with their Youth Football leagues and Youth Basketball leagues.

===All-Star cheerleading===

In the early 1980s, cheerleading squads not associated with a schools or sports leagues, whose main objective was competition, began to emerge. The first organization to call themselves all stars and go to competitions were the Q94 Rockers from [[Richmond, Virginia]], founded in 1982.&lt;ref name=&quot;ACFeb2007&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Smith | first = Jennifer Renèe | title = The All-Star Chronicles | journal = American Cheerleader | volume = 13 | issue = 1 | pages = 40–42 | month=  February|year=2007 | id = ISSN 1079-9885 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  All-star teams competing prior to 1987 were placed into the same divisions as teams that represented schools and sports leagues. In 1986, the National Cheerleaders Association (NCA) addressed this situation by creating a separate division for teams lacking a sponsoring school or athletic association, calling it the All-Star Division and debuting it at their 1987 competitions.  As the popularity of this type of team grew, more and more of them were formed, attending competitions sponsored by many different organizations and companies, each using its own set of rules, regulations and divisions. This situation became a concern to gym owners because the inconsistencies caused coaches to keep their routines in a constant state of flux, detracting from time that could be better utilized for developing skills and providing personal attention to their athletes. More importantly, because the various companies were constantly vying for a competitive edge, safety standards had become more and more lax. In some cases, unqualified coaches and inexperienced squads were attempting dangerous stunts as a result of these expanded sets of rules.&lt;ref name=&quot;varsity2004&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = The Cheerleading Worlds Administered by the USASF | publisher = Varsity Brands, Inc. | url = http://www.varsity.com/index.asp?article=1514 | accessdate = 2007-09-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The USASF was formed in 2003 by the competition companies to act as the national governing body for all star cheerleading and to create a standard set of rules and judging standards to be followed by all competitions sanctioned by the Federation, ultimately leading to the Cheerleading Worlds. The USASF hosted the first Cheerleading Worlds on April 24, 2004.&lt;ref name=&quot;varsity2004&quot;/&gt; In 2009, the first All-Level Worlds was held. It included teams from all levels, with each winner continuing to the online championships, where teams from across the nation competed to win the Worlds Title. At the same time, cheerleading coaches from all over the country organized themselves for the same rule making purpose, calling themselves the National All Star Cheerleading Coaches Congress (NACCC). In 2005, the NACCC was absorbed by the USASF to become their rule making body.&lt;ref name=&quot;ACFeb2007&quot;/&gt; In late 2006, the [[United States All Star Federation|USASF]] facilitated the creation of the International All-Star Federation (IASF), the first international governing body for the sport of cheerleading.&lt;ref name=&quot;USASFDec06Newsletter&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = USASF Insider | url = https://secure.usasf.net/Documents/Newsletters/December%202006.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate =  2007-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:ToeTouches.jpg|left|250px|thumb|A cheerleading squad performing toe-touches during a routine]]

Currently all-star cheerleading as sanctioned by the USASF involves a squad of 6–36 females and/or males. The squad prepares year-round for many different competition appearances, but they only actually perform for up to 2½ minutes during their routines. The numbers of competitions a team participates in varies from team to team, but generally, most teams tend to participate in eight-twelve competitions a year. These competitions include locals, which are normally taken place in school gymnasiums or local venues, nationals, hosted in big venues all around the U.S. with national champions, and the Cheerleading Worlds, taken place at Disney World in Orlando, Florida. During a competition routine, a squad performs carefully choreographed stunting, tumbling, jumping and dancing to their own custom music. Teams create their routines to an eight-count system and apply that to the music so the team members execute the elements with precise timing and synchronization.

There are many different organizations that host their own state and national competitions. Some major companies include: Universal Spirit, AmeriCheer, Cheersport, Planet Spirit, Eastern Cheer and Dance Association, and the JAM Brands. This means that many gyms within the same area could be state and national champions for the same year and never have competed against each other. Currently, there is no system in place that awards only one state or national title.

Judges at the competition watch for illegal moves from the group or any individual member. Here, an illegal move is something that is not allowed in that division due to difficulty and safety restrictions. They look out for deductions, or things that go wrong, such as a dropped stunt. They also look for touch downs in tumbling for deductions. More generally, judges look at the difficulty and execution of jumps, stunts and tumbling, synchronization, creativity, the sharpness of the motions, showmanship, and overall routine execution.

All-star cheerleaders are placed into divisions, which are grouped based upon age, size of the team, gender of participants, and ability level. The age levels vary from under 4 year of age to 18 years and over. The divisions used by the [[United States All Star Federation|USASF/IASF]] are currently Tiny, Mini, Youth, Junior, Junior International, Junior Coed, Senior, Senior Coed, Special Needs, and Open International. The sport originally began with &quot;all girl&quot; teams and later co-ed teams began to gain popularity. That being said, the all girl squad remains the most prevalent.&lt;ref name=&quot;USASF_Ages_07-08&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = USASF All-Star Cheer Divisions for 2007–2008 | url = https://secure.usasf.net/Documents/Rules/07-08/Age%20Grid%2007-08%20--%20Rev%203-23-07.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate =  2007-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ROOSTERS CHEERGIRLS .jpg|150px|thumb|right|Cheergirls from Australia's [[National Rugby League]]]]
If a team places high enough at selected [[United States All Star Federation|USASF/IASF]] sanctioned national competitions, they could be included in the [[United States All Star Federation|Cheerleading Worlds]] and compete against teams from all over the world, as well as receive money for placing.&lt;ref name=&quot;nw20007&quot;/&gt; Each team receives a bid from another cheerleading company and goes in the name of that company. You must get a bid from a company in order to compete at the Cheerleading Worlds. For example, a team could get a bid from Cheersport, and they compete as a team representing that company. Cheerleading companies give out three types of bids to go to Cheerleading Worlds, Full Paid Bid, Parital Bid, or an Un-paid bid. The Cheerleading Worlds are only for teams that are level 5 and up.

===Professional spirit squads===
Professional cheerleaders and dancers cheer for sports such as [[football]], [[basketball]], [[baseball]], [[wrestling]], or [[hockey]].  There are only a few professional cheerleading leagues around the world; some professional leagues include the [[National Basketball Association Cheerleading|NBA Cheerleading League]], the [[National Football League Cheerleading|NFL Cheerleading League]], and the [[Canadian Football League Cheerleading|CFL Cheerleading League]].  Although professional cheerleading leagues exist in multiple countries, there are no [[Olympics|Olympic Teams]].

In addition to cheering at games and competing, professional cheerleaders also, as teams, do a lot of [[philanthropy]] and [[charity work]], [[model (person)|modeling]], [[motivational speaking]], [[reality television|television performances]], and [[advertising]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nflcheerleader.blogspot.com/2008/10/who-you-gonna-call-ghostbusters.html |title=Blogspot.com |publisher=Nflcheerleader.blogspot.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?#doc_editlinks|date=May 2010}}

The revamped and provocative Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders of the 1970s—and the many imitators that followed—firmly established the cheerleader as an American icon of wholesome sex appeal.  In response, a new subgenre of exploitation films suddenly sprang up with titles such as ''[[The Cheerleaders]]'' (1972), ''[[The Swinging Cheerleaders]]'' (1974), ''Revenge of the Cheerleaders'' (1975), ''The Pom Pom Girls'' (1976), ''[[Satan's Cheerleaders]]'' (1977), and ''Cheerleaders's Wild Weekend'' (1979).  In addition to R-rated sex comedies and horror films, cheerleaders became a staple of the adult film industry, starting with ''[[Debbie Does Dallas]]'' (1978) and its four sequels.

On television, the made-for-TV movie ''The Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders'' (which aired January 14, 1979) starring [[Jane Seymour (actress)|Jane Seymour]] was a highly-rated success, spawning the 1980 sequel ''The Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders II''.

The Dallas squad was in high demand during the late '70s with frequent appearances on network specials, awards shows, variety programs, commercials, the game show ''[[Family Feud]]'' and sitcoms such as ''[[The Love Boat]]''.  The sci-fi sitcom ''[[Mork &amp; Mindy]]'' also based a 1979 episode around the [[Denver Broncos]] cheerleaders with Mork ([[Robin Williams]]) trying out for the squad.

Cheerleading's increasing popularity in recent decades has made it a prominent feature in high-school themed movies and television shows. The 2000 film ''[[Bring It On (film)|Bring It On]]'', about a [[San Diego]] high school cheerleading squad called &quot;The Toros&quot;, starred real-life former cheerleader [[Kirsten Dunst]].  ''Bring It On'' was a surprise hit and earned nearly $70 million domestically.  It spawned five direct-to-video [[sequels]]: ''[[Bring It On Again]]'' in 2003, ''[[Bring It On: All or Nothing]]'' in 2006, ''[[Bring It On: In It to Win It]]'' in 2007, and [[Bring It On: Fight to the Finish]].  ''Bring It On'' was followed in 2001 by another teen cheerleading comedy, ''[[Sugar &amp; Spice]]''. In 1993, ''[[The Positively True Adventures of the Alleged Texas Cheerleader-Murdering Mom]]'' was a [[TV movie]] which told the true story of [[Wanda Holloway]], the Texas mother whose obsession with her daughter's cheerleading career made headline news.

In 2006, [[Hayden Panettiere]], star of ''Bring It On: All or Nothing'', took another cheerleading role as [[Claire Bennet]], the cheerleader with an accelerated [[healing factor]] on [[NBC]]'s hit [[sci-fi]] [[TV series]] [[Heroes (TV series)|''Heroes'']], launching cheerleading back into the limelight of pop culture.  Claire was the main focus of the show's first story arc, featuring the popular catchphrase, &quot;Save the cheerleader, save the world&quot;.  Her prominent, protagonist role in ''Heroes'' was supported by a strong fan-base and provided a positive image for high school cheerleading.

In 2009, Panettiere starred again as a cheerleader, this time as Beth Cooper in the film adaptation of the [[novel]] ''[[I Love You, Beth Cooper]]''.

In 2006, the reality show ''[[Cheerleader Nation]]'' was featured on the [[Lifetime (TV network)|Lifetime]] television channel. ''Cheerleader Nation'' is a 60 minute television series based on the [[Paul Laurence Dunbar High School]] cheerleading team's ups and downs on the way to nationals, of which they are the three time champions. The show also explains that cheerleading is a tough sport. The show takes place in [[Lexington, Kentucky]].

The 2007 series ''[[Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders: Making the Team]]'' shows the process of getting on the pro squad of the Dallas Cowboy cheerleaders. Everything from initial tryouts to workout routines and the difficulties involved is shown. The series was extended a year to show the process of getting the 2008 Cheerleaders ready.

In 2009, Universal Pictures signed music video and film director [[Billie Woodruff]] (''[[Barbershop (film)|Barbershop]]'', ''[[Honey (film)|Honey]]'') to direct the fifth film in the ''Bring It On'' series titled ''[[Bring It On: Fight to the Finish]]''. The film stars [[Christina Milian]] (who previously played cheerleaders in [[Love Don't Cost a Thing (film)|Love Don't Cost a Thing]] and [[Man of the House (2005 comedy film)|Man of the House]]) and Rachelle Brook Smith, and was released directly to DVD and Blu-ray on September 1, 2009.

The series ''[[Glee (TV Series)|Glee]]'', which began in 2009, features [[Dianna Agron]] as [[Quinn Fabray]], the captain of her high school cheerleading squad, the Cheerios. Quinn becomes pregnant, leading to her expulsion from the squad, but two of the other Cheerios, [[Santana Lopez]] and [[Brittany Pierce]] also feature heavily in the show. In &quot;[[The Power of Madonna]]&quot; [[Kurt Hummel]] joins the Cheerios along with [[Mercedes Jones]] after being fed up with getting no solos from Mr. [[Will Schuester]].

A new 2010 show, [[Hellcats]] was just released on the CW. It is about college cheerleading. It stars [[Ashley Tisdale]] and [[Alyson Michalka]] stars as Marty, a former gymnast who is forced to become a cheerleader after her academic scolarship is canceled. This show is about the ups and downs of being a cheerleader at Lancer University.

===Video games===
Nintendo has released a pair of video games in Japan for the [[Nintendo DS]], ''[[Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan]]'' and its sequel ''[[Moero! Nekketsu Rhythm Damashii Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan 2|Moero! Nekketsu Rhythm Damashii]]'' that star teams of male cheer squads, or [[Ouendan]] that practice a form of cheerleading. Each of the games' most difficult modes replaces the male characters with female cheer squads that dress in western cheerleading uniforms. The games task the cheer squads with assisting people in desperate need of help by cheering them on and giving them the motivation to succeed. There are also a ''All Star Cheerleader'' and ''[[We Cheer]]'' for the Wii in which you do routines at competitions with the Wiimote &amp; Nunchuck. All Star Cheerleader is also available for Nintendo DS.

==Sport debate==
There has been debate on whether or not cheerleading truly is a ''sport''. Supporters consider cheerleading, as a whole, a sport, citing the heavy use of athletic talents&lt;ref name=&quot;cheerleading1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title= The road to recognition |work=BCA resources|date=August 2, 2008|url=http://www.cheerleading.org.uk/news/recognition.htm |accessdate=August 2, 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080226060536/http://www.cheerleading.org.uk/news/recognition.htm |archivedate = February 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cheerleading in the USA: A sport and an industry |work=[[USA Today]]|date=April 26, 2002|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/_stories/2002-04-26-cheerleading-cover.htm |accessdate=December 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; while critics do not see it as deserving of that status since ''sport'' implies a competition among squads and not all squads compete, along with subjectivity of competitions where - as with [[gymnastics]], [[diving]], and [[figure skating]] - scores are assessed based on human judgment and not an objective goal or measurement of time.&lt;ref name=&quot;stanford&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Sport, not a sport: consider Dan the expert |work=[[The Stanford Daily]]|date=September 29, 2004|url=http://daily.stanford.edu/article/2004/9/29/sportNotASportConsiderDanTheExpert |accessdate=December 15, 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070104000827/http://daily.stanford.edu/article/2004/9/29/sportNotASportConsiderDanTheExpert |archivedate = January 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SFU&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title= No, Cheerleading is not a Sport|first=Jamie |last=Meades |work=SFU Cheer Resources|publisher=[[Simon Fraser University]]|date=September 29, 2004|url=http://www.sfucheerleading.ca/index.php?page=10&amp;sub=9&amp;method=view&amp;id=10 |accessdate=December 15, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.www.thequindecim.com/media/storage/paper618/news/2005/05/04/SportsAndWellness/Point.What.Makes.A.Sport.A.Sport-947338.shtml|title=Point: What Makes a Sport a Sport?|first=Tyler|last=Adams |work=The Quindecim |publisher=[[Goucher College]] |date=May 4, 2009 |accessdate=July 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dangers of cheerleading==
{{Expand section|date=March 2008}}
The risk of cheerleading was highlighted when Kristi Yamaoka, a cheerleader for Southern Illinois University, suffered from a fractured vertebra after she hit her head after falling from a [[human pyramid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.athleticmanagement.com/2007/02/13/cheer_bans_continue/index.php|title=Cheer Bans continue|work=Athletic Management|issue=August/September 2006|accessdate=May 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She also suffered from a concussion, and a bruised lung.&lt;ref name=CWT/&gt;  The fall occurred when Yamaoka lost her balance during a basketball game between [[Southern Illinois University]] and [[Bradley University]] at the [[Savvis Center]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] on March 5, 2006.&lt;ref name=CWT&gt;{{cite web

| accessdate=2007-09-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The fall gained &quot;national attention&quot;,&lt;ref name=CWT/&gt; because Yamaoka continued to perform from a stretcher as she was moved away from the game.&lt;ref name=CWT/&gt;  Yamaoka has since made a full recovery.

The accident caused the Missouri Valley Conference to ban its member schools from allowing cheerleaders to be &quot;launched or tossed and from taking part in formations higher than two levels&quot; for one week during a women's basketball conference tournament, and also resulted in a recommendation by the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] that conferences and tournaments do not allow pyramids two and one half levels high or higher, and a stunt known as basket tosses, during the rest of the men's and women's basketball season.&lt;ref name=&quot;aacca.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The committee unanimously voted for sweeping revisions to cheerleading safety rules, the most major of which restricts specific upper-level skills during basketball games. Basket tosses, 2½ high pyramids, one-arm stunts, stunts that involve twisting or flipping, and twisting tumbling skills may only be performed during halftime and post-game on a matted surface and are prohibited during game play or time-outs.&lt;ref name=&quot;aacca.org&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Out of the United States' 2.9 million female high school athletes, only 3% are cheerleaders, yet cheerleading accounts for 65% of all catastrophic injuries in girls' high school athletics. Since the NCAA has yet to recognize cheerleading as an official college sport, there are no solid numbers on college cheerleading, yet when it comes to injuries, 67% of female athlete injuries at the college level are due to cheerleading mishaps.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} LiveScience.com  recaps new evidence showing that the most dangerous sport for high school and college females is cheerleading: Another study found that between 1982 and 2007, there were 103 fatal, disabling or serious injuries recorded among female high school athletes, with the vast majority (67) occurring in cheerleading.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.evidencesoup.com/canopener/2009/06/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 2000s, cheerleading was considered one of the most dangerous school activities.  The main source of injuries comes from [[List of cheerleading stunts|stunting]], also known as pyramids.  These stunts are performed at games and pep rallies, as well as competitions.  Sometimes competition routines are focused solely around the use of difficult and risky stunts.  These stunts usually include a flyer (the person on top), along with one or two bases (the people on the bottom) and, one or two spotters in the front and back on the bottom.  The most common cheerleading related injuries are: sprained ankles, sprained wrists, back injuries, head injuries (sometimes concussions), broken arms, elbow injuries, knee injuries, broken noses, and broken collarbones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The journal ''[[Pediatrics (journal)|Pediatrics]]'' has reportedly said that the number of cheerleaders suffering from broken bones, concussions, and sprains has increased by over 100 percent between the years of 1990 and 2002, and that in 2001 there were 25,000 hospital visits reported for cheerleading injuries dealing with the shoulder, ankle, head, and neck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Cottingley Fairies 1.jpg|thumb|250px|alt=photo|The first of the five photographs, taken by Elsie Wright in 1917, shows Frances Griffiths with the alleged fairies.]]
The '''Cottingley Fairies''' appear in a series of five photographs taken by Elsie Wright and Frances Griffiths, two young cousins who lived in [[Cottingley, Bradford|Cottingley]], near [[Bradford]] in England. In 1917, when the first two photographs were taken, Elsie was 16 years old and Frances was 10. The pictures came to the attention of writer Sir [[Arthur Conan Doyle]], who used them to illustrate an article on [[fairies]] he had been commissioned to write for the Christmas 1920 edition of ''[[Strand Magazine|The Strand Magazine]]''. Conan Doyle, as a [[Spiritualism (religious movement)|spiritualist]], was enthusiastic about the photographs, and interpreted them as clear and visible evidence of [[psychic]] phenomena. Public reaction was mixed; some accepted the images as genuine, but others believed they had been faked.

Interest in the Cottingley Fairies gradually declined after 1921. Both girls grew up, married and lived abroad for a time. Yet the photographs continued to hold the public imagination; in 1966 a reporter from the ''[[Daily Express]]'' newspaper traced Elsie, who had by then returned to the UK. Elsie left open the possibility that she believed she had photographed her thoughts, and the media once again became interested in the story. In the early 1980s Elsie and Frances admitted that the photographs were faked using cardboard cutouts of fairies copied from a popular children's book of the time, but Frances continued to claim that the fifth and final photograph was genuine. 

The photographs and two of the cameras used are on display in the [[National Media Museum]] in Bradford.

==1917 photographs==
[[File:CottingleyBeck.jpg|thumb|upright||alt=Photo|Cottingley Beck, where Frances and Elsie claimed to have seen the fairies]]
In mid-1917 ten-year-old Frances Griffiths and her mother{{ndash}} both newly arrived in the UK from South Africa{{ndash}} were staying with Frances' aunt, Elsie Wright's mother, in the village of [[Cottingley, Bradford|Cottingley]] in [[West Yorkshire]]; Elsie was then 16 years old. The two girls often played together beside the beck (stream) at the bottom of the garden, much to their mothers' annoyance, because they frequently came back with wet feet and clothes. Frances and Elsie said they only went to the beck to see the fairies, and to prove it, Elsie borrowed her father's camera, a Midg [[Film format#Still photography film formats|quarter-plate]]. The girls returned about 30&amp;nbsp;minutes later, &quot;triumphant&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Magnusson|2006|pp=97–98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elsie's father, Arthur, was a keen amateur photographer, and had set up his own darkroom. The picture on the [[photographic plate]] he developed showed Frances behind a bush in the foreground, on which four fairies appeared to be dancing. Knowing his daughter's artistic ability, and that she had spent some time working in a photographer's studio, he dismissed the figures as cardboard cutouts. Two months later the girls borrowed his camera again, and this time returned with a photograph of Elsie sitting on the lawn holding out her hand to a {{convert|1|ft|cm|adj=on|disp=x|-tall (|)}} gnome. Exasperated by what he believed to be &quot;nothing but a prank&quot;,&lt;ref name=MagnussonP97/&gt; and convinced that the girls must have tampered with his camera in some way, Arthur Wright refused to lend it to them again.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prashad|2008|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; His wife Polly, however, believed the photographs to be authentic.&lt;ref name=MagnussonP97&gt;{{Harvnb|Magnusson|2006|p=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote box |width=25em |align=right |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=left |quote=I am learning French, Geometry, Cookery and Algebra at school now. Dad came home from France the other week after being there ten months, and we all think the war will be over in a few days&amp;nbsp;... I am sending two photos, both of me, one of me in a bathing costume in our back yard, while the other is me with some fairies. Elsie took that one.|source=Letter from Frances Griffiths to a friend in South Africa&lt;ref name=PrashadP40&gt;{{Harvnb|Prashad|2008|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Towards the end of 1918, Frances sent a letter to Johanna Parvin, a friend in [[Cape Town]], South Africa, where Frances had lived for most of her life, enclosing the photograph of her with the fairies. On the back she wrote &quot;It is funny, I never used to see them in Africa. It must be too hot for them there.&quot;&lt;ref name=PrashadP40/&gt;

The photographs became public in mid-1919, after Elsie's mother attended a meeting of the [[Theosophical Society]] in Bradford. The lecture that evening was on &quot;Fairy Life&quot;, and at the end of the meeting Polly Wright showed the two fairy photographs taken by her daughter and niece to the speaker. As a result, the photographs were displayed at the Society's annual conference in [[Harrogate]], held a few months later. There they came to the attention of a leading member of the Society, Edward Gardner.&lt;ref name=MagnussonPP98-99&gt;{{Harvnb|Magnusson|2006|pp=98–99}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the central beliefs of Theosophy is that humanity is undergoing a cycle of evolution, towards increasing &quot;perfection&quot;, and Gardner recognised the potential significance of the photographs for the movement:
{{quote|... the fact that two young girls had not only been able to see fairies, which others had done, but had actually for the first time ever been able to materialise them at a density sufficient for their images to be recorded on a photographic plate, meant that it was possible that the next cycle of evolution was underway.&lt;ref name=SmithP382&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|1997|p=382}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Initial examinations==
Gardner sent the prints along with the original glass-plate negatives to Harold Snelling, a photography expert. Snelling's opinion was that &quot;the two negatives are entirely genuine, unfaked photographs&amp;nbsp;... [with] no trace whatsoever of studio work involving card or paper models&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Magnusson|2006|p=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--important to retain the big difference between unretouched and 'showing faries'--&gt; He did not go so far as to say that the photographs showed fairies, stating only that &quot;these are straight forward photographs of whatever was in front of the camera at the time&quot;.&lt;ref name=SmithP389&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|1997|p=389}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gardner had the prints &quot;clarified&quot; by Snelling, and new negatives produced, &quot;more conducive to printing&quot;,&lt;ref name=MagnussonPP98-99/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|1997|p=382}}&lt;/ref&gt; for use in the illustrated lectures he gave around the UK.&lt;ref name=SmithP382/&gt; Snelling supplied the photographic prints which were available for sale at Gardner's lectures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|1997|p=401}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=crawley/&gt;

[[File:CottingleyFairies2.jpg|thumb|upright|left|alt=Photo|The second of the five photographs, showing Elsie with a winged gnome]]
Author and prominent [[Spiritualism (religious movement)|Spiritualist]] [[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]] learned of the photographs from the editor of the Spiritualists' publication ''Light''.&lt;ref name=SmithP383&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|1997|p=383}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had been commissioned by ''[[The Strand Magazine]]'' to write an article on fairies for their Christmas issue, and the fairy photographs &quot;must have seemed like a godsend&quot; according to broadcaster and historian [[Magnus Magnusson]]. Conan Doyle contacted Gardner in June 1920 to determine the background to the photographs, and wrote to Elsie and her father to request permission from the latter to use the prints in his article. Arthur Wright was &quot;obviously impressed&quot; that Conan Doyle was involved, and gave his permission for publication, but he refused payment on the grounds that, if genuine, the images should not be &quot;soiled&quot; by money.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Magnusson|2006|pp=99–100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gardner and Conan Doyle sought a second expert opinion from the photographic company [[Eastman Kodak|Kodak]]. Several of the company's technicians examined the enhanced prints, and although they agreed with Snelling that the pictures &quot;showed no signs of being faked&quot;, they concluded that &quot;this could not be taken as conclusive evidence&amp;nbsp;... that they were authentic photographs of fairies&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|1997|p=384}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kodak declined to issue a certificate of authenticity.&lt;ref name=MagnussonP101&gt;{{Harvnb|Magnusson|2006|p=101}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gardner believed that the Kodak technicians may not have examined the photographs entirely objectively, observing that one had commented &quot;after all, as fairies couldn't be true, the photographs must have been faked somehow&quot;.&lt;ref name=SmithP385&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|1997|p=385}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prints were also examined by another photographic company, [[Ilford Photo|Ilford]], who reported unequivocally that there was &quot;some evidence of faking&quot;.&lt;ref name=SmithP385/&gt; Gardner and Conan Doyle, perhaps rather optimistically, interpreted the results of the three expert evaluations as two in favour of the photographs' authenticity and one against.&lt;ref name=SmithP385/&gt;

Conan Doyle also showed the photographs to the [[physicist]] and pioneering [[parapsychology|psychical researcher]] [[Sir Oliver Lodge]], who believed the photographs to be fake. He suggested that a troupe of dancers had masqueraded as fairies, and expressed doubt as to their &quot;distinctly 'Parisienne{{'&quot;}} hairstyles.&lt;ref name=MagnussonP101/&gt;{{clear}}

==1920 photographs==

Conan Doyle was preoccupied with organising an imminent lecture tour of Australia, and in July 1920, sent Gardner to meet the Wright family. Frances was by then living with her parents in [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]],&lt;ref name=SmithP385/&gt; but Elsie's father told Gardner that he had been so certain the photographs were fakes that while the girls were away he searched their bedroom and the area around the beck (stream), looking for scraps of pictures or cutouts, but found nothing &quot;incriminating&quot;.&lt;ref name=MagnussonP102/&gt;

[[File:CottingleyFairies3.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Photo|''Frances and the Leaping Fairy'', the third photograph]]
Gardner believed the Wright family to be honest and respectable. To place the matter of the photographs' authenticity beyond doubt, he returned to Cottingley at the end of July with two Cameo cameras and 24&amp;nbsp;secretly marked photographic plates. Frances was invited to stay with the Wright family during the school summer holiday so that she and Elsie could take more pictures of the fairies.&lt;ref name=MagnussonP102&gt;{{Harvnb|Magnusson|2006|p=102}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gardner described his briefing in his 1945 ''Fairies: A Book of Real Fairies'':
{{imagequote|180|I went off, to Cottingley again, taking the two cameras and plates from London, and met the family and explained to the two girls the simple working of the cameras, giving one each to keep. The cameras were loaded, and my final advice was that they need go up to the glen only on fine days as they had been accustomed to do before and ''tice'' the fairies, as they called their way of attracting them, and see what they could get. I suggested only the most obvious and easy precautions about lighting and distance, for I knew it was essential they should feel free and unhampered and have no burden of responsibility. If nothing came of it all, I told them, they were not to mind a bit.&lt;ref name=Cooper/&gt;}}
Until 19&amp;nbsp;August the weather was unsuitable for photography. Because Frances and Elsie insisted that the fairies would not show themselves if others were watching, Elsie's mother was persuaded to visit her sister's for tea, leaving the girls alone. In her absence the girls took several photographs, two of which appeared to show fairies. In the first, ''Frances and the Leaping Fairy'', Frances is shown in profile with a winged fairy close by her nose. The second, ''Fairy offering Posy of [[Campanula rotundifolia|Harebells]] to Elsie'', shows a fairy either hovering or tiptoeing on a branch, and offering Elsie a flower. Two days later the girls took the last picture, ''Fairies and Their Sun-Bath''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Magnusson|2006|pp=102–103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The plates were packed in cotton wool and returned to Gardner in London, who sent an &quot;ecstatic&quot; telegram to Conan Doyle, by then in [[Melbourne]].&lt;ref name=MagnussonP103/&gt; Conan Doyle wrote back:
{{imagequote|180|My heart was gladdened when out here in far Australia I had your note and the three wonderful pictures which are confirmatory of our published results. When our fairies are admitted other psychic phenomena will find a more ready acceptance&amp;nbsp;... We have had continued messages at seances for some time that a visible sign was coming through.&lt;ref name=MagnussonP103&gt;{{Harvnb|Magnusson|2006|p=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}{{clear}}

==Publication and reaction==

[[File:CottingleyFairies4.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Photo|The fourth photograph, ''Fairy Offering Posy of Harebells to Elsie'']]
Conan Doyle's article in the December 1920 issue of ''The Strand'' contained two higher resolution prints of the 1917 photographs, and sold out within days of publication. To protect the girls' anonymity, Frances and Elsie were named as Alice and Iris respectively, and the Wright family was referred to as the Carpenters.&lt;ref name=SmithP388&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|1997|p=388}}&lt;/ref&gt; An enthusiastic and committed Spiritualist, Conan Doyle hoped that if the photographs convinced the  public of the existence of fairies, then they might more readily accept other psychic phenomena.&lt;ref name=Roden&gt;{{citation |last=Roden |first=Barbara |title=The Coming of the Fairies: An Alternative View of the Episode of the Cottingley Fairies |url=http://www.ash-tree.bc.ca/acdsfairies.htm |publisher=The Arthur Conan Doyle Society |accessdate=25&amp;nbsp;April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He ended his article with the words:
{{imagequote|180|The recognition of their existence will jolt the material twentieth century mind out of its heavy ruts in the mud, and will make it admit that there is a glamour and mystery to life. Having discovered this, the world will not find it so difficult to accept that spiritual message supported by physical facts which has already been put before it.&lt;ref name=Roden/&gt;}}
Early press coverage was &quot;mixed&quot;,&lt;ref name=SmithP390/&gt; generally a combination of &quot;embarrassment and puzzlement&quot;.&lt;ref name=SmithP391&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|1997|p=391}}&lt;/ref&gt; The historical novelist and poet [[Maurice Hewlett]] published a series of articles in the literary journal ''John O' London's Weekly'', in which he concluded: &quot;And knowing children, and knowing that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle has legs, I decide that the Miss Carpenters have pulled one of them.&quot;&lt;ref name=SmithP390/&gt; The Sydney newspaper ''[[Truth (Sydney newspaper)|Truth]]'' on 5&amp;nbsp;January 1921 expressed a similar view; &quot;For the true explanation of these fairy photographs what is wanted is not a knowledge of occult phenomena but a knowledge of children.&quot;&lt;ref name=Cooper/&gt; Some public figures were more sympathetic. [[Margaret McMillan]], the educational and social reformer, wrote: &quot;How wonderful that to these dear children such a wonderful gift has been vouchsafed.&quot;&lt;ref name=SmithP390/&gt; The novelist [[Henry de Vere Stacpoole]] decided to take the fairy photographs and the girls at face value.&lt;ref name=Cooper&gt;{{citation |last=Cooper |first=Joe |title=Cottingley: At Last the Truth |journal=The Unexplained |year=1982 |issue=117 |pages=2,338–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter to Gardner he wrote: &quot;Look at Alice's [Frances'] face. Look at Iris's [Elsie's] face. There is an extraordinary thing called TRUTH which has 10&amp;nbsp;million faces and forms{{ndash}} it is God's currency and the cleverest coiner or forger can't imitate it.&quot;

[[John Hall-Edwards|Major John Hall-Edwards]], a keen photographer and pioneer of medical X-ray treatments in Britain, was a particularly vigorous critic:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Major John Hall-Edwards |url=http://www.birmingham.gov.uk/xray |publisher=Birmingham City Council |accessdate=23&amp;nbsp;April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|On the evidence I have no hesitation in saying that these photographs could have been &quot;faked&quot;. I criticize the attitude of those who declared there is something supernatural in the circumstances attending to the taking of these pictures because, as a medical man, I believe that the inculcation of such absurd ideas into the minds of children will result in later life in manifestations and nervous disorder and mental disturbances.&lt;ref name=Cooper/&gt;}}
Conan Doyle used the later photographs in 1921 to illustrate a second article in ''The Strand'', in which he described other accounts of fairy sightings. The article formed the foundation for his 1922  book ''The Coming of the Fairies''.&lt;ref name=&quot;SmithP389&quot;/&gt; As before, the photographs were received with mixed credulity. Sceptics noted that the fairies &quot;looked suspiciously like the traditional fairies of nursery tales&quot; and that they had &quot;very fashionable hairstyles&quot;.&lt;ref name=Cooper/&gt;

==Gardner's final visit==
Gardner made a final visit to Cottingley in August 1921. He again brought cameras and photographic plates for Frances and Elsie, but was accompanied by the clairvoyant [[Geoffrey Hodson]]. Although neither of the girls claimed to see any fairies, and there were no more photographs, &quot;on the contrary, he [Hodson] saw them [fairies] everywhere&quot; and wrote voluminous notes on his observations.&lt;ref name=SmithP390&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|1997|p=390}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By now Elsie and Frances were tired of the whole fairy business. Years later Elsie looked at a photograph of herself and Frances taken with Hodson and said: &quot;Look at that, fed up with fairies!&quot; Both Elsie and Frances later admitted that they &quot;played along&quot; with Hodson &quot;out of mischief&quot;,&lt;ref name=MagnussonP105/&gt; and that they considered him &quot;a fake&quot;.&lt;ref name=SmithP390/&gt;

==Later investigations==
Public interest in the Cottingley Fairies gradually subsided after 1921. Elsie and Frances eventually married and lived abroad for many years.&lt;ref name=SmithP393&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|1997|p=393}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966, a reporter from the ''Daily Express'' newspaper traced Elsie, who was by then back in England. She admitted in an interview given that year that the fairies might have been &quot;figments of my imagination&quot;, but left open the possibility she believed that she had somehow managed to photograph her thoughts.&lt;ref name=MagnussonP104&gt;{{Harvnb|Magnusson|2006|p=104}}&lt;/ref&gt; The media subsequently once again became interested in Frances and Elsie's photographs.&lt;ref name=Cooper/&gt; [[BBC]] television's ''[[Nationwide (TV series)|Nationwide]]'' programme investigated the case in 1971, but Elsie stuck to her story: &quot;I've told you that they're photographs of figments of our imagination, and that's what I'm sticking to&quot;.&lt;ref name=MagnussonP104/&gt;

Elsie and Frances were interviewed by journalist [[Austin Mitchell]] in September 1976, for a programme broadcast on [[Yorkshire Television]]. When pressed, both women agreed that &quot;a rational person doesn't see fairies&quot;, but they denied having fabricated the photographs.&lt;ref name=MagnussonP105&gt;{{Harvnb|Magnusson|2006|p=105}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1978 the magician and [[scientific skepticism|scientific sceptic]] [[James Randi]] and a team from the [[Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal]] examined the photographs, using a &quot;computer enhancement process&quot;. They concluded that the photographs were fakes, and that strings could be seen supporting the fairies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|1997|pp=394–395}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Geoffrey Crawley]], editor of the ''British Journal of Photography'', undertook a &quot;major scientific investigation of the photographs and the events surrounding them&quot;, published between 1982 and 1983, &quot;the first major postwar analysis of the affair&quot;. He also concluded that the pictures were fakes.&lt;ref name=SmithP395&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|1997|p=395}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Confession==
[[File:Cottingley fairies illustration.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Three dancing figures|One of Claude Arthur Shepperson's illustrations of fairies, from ''Princess Mary's Gift Book'']]
In 1983, the cousins admitted in an article published in the magazine ''[[The Unexplained (magazine)|The Unexplained]]'' that the photographs had been faked, although both maintained that they really had seen fairies. Elsie had copied illustrations of fairies from a popular children's book of the time, ''Princess Mary's Gift Book'', published in 1914. They said they had then cut out the cardboard figures and supported them with hat pins, disposing of their props in the beck once the photograph had been taken.&lt;ref name=MagnussonP105/&gt; But the cousins disagreed about the fifth and final photograph, which Conan Doyle in his ''The Coming of the Fairies'' described in this way:
{{quote|Seated on the upper left hand edge with wing well displayed is an undraped fairy apparently considering whether it is time to get up. An earlier riser of more mature age is seen on the right possessing abundant hair and wonderful wings. Her slightly denser body can be glimpsed within her fairy dress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Conan Doyle|2006|p=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:CottingleyFairies-PrincessMary2 gobeirne.png|right|thumb|Comparison of Cottingley Fairies and illustrations from ''Princess Mary's Gift Book'']]

Elsie maintained it was a fake, just like all the others, but Frances insisted that it was genuine. In an interview given during the early 1980s Frances said:
{{quote|It was a wet Saturday afternoon and we were just mooching about with our cameras and Elsie had nothing prepared. I saw these fairies building up in the grasses and just aimed the camera and took a photograph.&lt;ref name=Cooper/&gt;}}

[[Image:Cottingley-sunbath.jpg|thumb|250px|left|alt=Photograph|''Fairies and Their Sun-Bath'', the fifth and last photograph of the Cottingley Fairies]]

In a 1985 television interview on ''[[Arthur C.

Frances' daughter, Christine Lynch, appeared in an episode of the television programme ''[[Antiques Roadshow]]'' in [[Belfast]], broadcast on [[BBC One]] in January 2009, with the photographs and one of the cameras given to the girls by Conan Doyle. Christine told the expert, [[Paul Atterbury]], that she believed, as her mother had done, that the fairies in the fifth photograph were genuine.

'''Cheka''' ('''ЧК''' - чрезвыча́йная коми́ссия ''Chrezvychaynaya Komissiya'', Extraordinary Commission {{IPA-ru|tɕɛ.ˈka}}) was the first of a succession of [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[state security]] organizations. It was created by a decree issued on December 20, 1917, by [[Vladimir Lenin]] and subsequently led by [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrat]] turned [[communist]] [[Felix Dzerzhinsky]].&lt;ref name=Stalinsleadership&gt;{{cite book |title=The Impact of Stalin's Leadership in the USSR,1924-1941 |authorlink=John Laver |year=2008 |publisher=Nelson Thornes |isbn=978-0-7487-8267-3 |pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; After 1922, the Cheka underwent [[Chronology of Soviet secret police agencies|a series of reorganization]]s into bodies whose members continued to be referred to as &quot;Chekisty&quot; (Chekists) into the late 1980s.&lt;ref name=&quot;lcweb2.loc.gov&quot;&gt;http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/soviet_union/su_glos.html#union&lt;/ref&gt;

From its founding, the Cheka was an important military and security arm of the Bolshevik communist government.  In 1921 the ''[[Internal Troops|Troops for the Internal Defense of the Republic]]'' (a branch of the Cheka) numbered 200,000. These troops policed [[labor camps]]; ran the [[Gulag]] system; conducted [[Prodrazvyorstka|requisitions of food]]; subjected political opponents (on both the right and the left) to [[torture]] and [[summary execution]]; and put down (peasant) rebellions, riots by workers, and mutinies in the desertion-plagued [[Red Army]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Black&quot;&gt;Nicolas Werth, Karel Bartošek, Jean-Louis Panné, Jean-Louis Margolin, Andrzej Paczkowski, [[Stéphane Courtois]], ''The [[Black Book of Communism]]: Crimes, Terror, Repression'', [[Harvard University Press]], 1999, hardcover, 858 pages, ISBN 0-674-07608-7&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name==
The name of the agency was originally ''The All-Russian Extraordinary Commission for Combating [[Anti-Soviet agitation|Counter-Revolution]] and [[Sabotage]]''&lt;ref name=Stalinsleadership/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;lcweb2.loc.gov&quot;/&gt;
({{lang-ru|Всероссийская чрезвычайная комиссия по борьбе с контрреволюцией и саботажем}}; ''Vserossiyskaya Chrezvychaynaya Komissiya po Bor'bye s Kontr-revolyutsiyei i Sabotazhem''), but was often shortened to ''Cheka'' or ''VCheka''. In 1918 its name was changed, becoming ''All-Russian Extraordinary Commission for Combating Counter-Revolution, [[Profiteering (business)|Profiteering]] and [[Political corruption|Corruption]].''

A member of Cheka was called a ''chekist''. Chekists of the years after the [[October Revolution]] wore leather jackets creating a fashion followed by Western [[communism|communist]]s{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}; they are pictured in several films in this apparel. Despite changes over time, Soviet secret policemen were often referred to as &quot;Chekists&quot; throughout the Soviet period. In ''[[The Gulag Archipelago]]'', [[Alexander Solzhenitsyn]] recalls that [[White_Sea-Baltic_Canal#Commemoration|zeks]] in the [[Gulag|labor camps]] used &quot;old ''Chekist''&quot; as &quot;a mark of special esteem&quot; for particularly experienced camp administrators.&lt;ref name=&quot;Solzhenitsyn cite&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=The Gulag Archipelago |last=Solzhenitsyn |first=Alexander |authorlink=Alexander Solzhenitsyn |coauthors= |year=1974 |publisher=[[Harper Perennial]] |location=New York, NY |isbn=006092103X |volume= II |pages= 537–38|quote=''An old Chekist''! Who has not heard these words, drawled with emphasis, as a mark of special esteem? If the zeks wish to distinguish a camp keeper from those who are inexperienced, inclined to fuss, and do not have a bulldog grip, they say: 'And the chief there is an o-o-old Chekist!' ... 'An old Chekist' — what that means  at the least is that he was well-regarded under [[Genrikh Yagoda|Yagoda]], [[Nikolai Yezhov|Yezhov]] and [[Lavrenti Beria|Beria]]. He was useful to them all.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is still found in use in [[Russia]] today (for example, President [[Vladimir Putin]] has been referred to in the Russian [[News media|media]] as a ''&quot;chekist&quot;'' due to his career in the [[KGB]]{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}).

==History==
===Creation===
[[File:Menzhinsky V 1921-2.jpg|thumb|Members of the [[presidium]] of VCheKa (left to right) [[Yakov Peters]], [[Józef Unszlicht]], [[A. Ya. Belenky]] (standing), Felix Dzerzhinsky, [[Vyacheslav Menzhinsky]], 1921]]

In the first month and half after the [[October Revolution]] the duties of &quot;extinguishing the resistance of exploiters&quot; were assigned to the Petrograd [[Military Revolutionary Committee]] (further VRK). It represented a temporary, extraordinary body working under directives of [[Sovnarkom]] and [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee]] of [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party|RDSRP]]([[Bolshevik|b]]). The VRK created new bodies of government{{Clarify|date=April 2011}}, organized food supply to cities and the Army, requisitioned products from ''[[bourgeoisie]]'', sent its emissaries and agitators to provinces. One of its most important  functions was the security of ''[[revolutionary]] order'' and the fight against ''[[counterrevolutionary]]'' activity (see [[Anti-Soviet agitation]]).

On December 1, 1917 the [[All-Russian Central Executive Committee]] (VTsIK or TsIK)&lt;ref&gt;[[All-Russian Central Executive Committee]] (VTsIK or TsIK) is not to be confused with the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee]] of [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party|RDSRP]]([[Bolshevik|b]])&lt;/ref&gt; reviewed a proposition of reorganization of the VRK and creation instead of it the department in the fight against counterrevolutionary. On December 5 the Petrograd VRK published an announcement of dissolution and transfer the functions to the department of TsIK in the fight against counterrevolutionary.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mozokhin&quot;&gt;[http://mozohin.ru/article/a-4.html Mozokhin, O.B. ''out of history of activities of VChK, OGPU, NKVD, MGB''. FSB archives.]{{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 6 the [[Sovnarkom]] reviewed an issue &quot;Possibility of strike by workers of government institutions on the All-Russian scale&quot;. It was decided to organize a special commission to find ways to fight such event by implementing the &quot;most energetically revolutionary&quot; measures. On the position of a chairman of the commission was offered a candidacy of [[Felix Dzerzhinsky]] (the Iron Felix) who was directed by [[Sovnarkom]] to its next meeting present a list of the commission members and compose measures in fight against sabotage. Dzerzhinsky invited the following people: V. K. Averin, V. N. Vasilevsky, D. G. Yevseyev, N. A. Zhydelev, I. K. Ksenofontov, [[Grigoriy Ordzhonikidze|G. K. Ordjonikidze]], [[Yakov Peters|Ya. Kh. Peters]], K. A. Peterson, [[Valentin Trifonov|V. A. Trifonov]].

[[File:Sankt Petersburg-Regierungssitz Smolny.jpg|thumb|left|[[Smolny Institute|Smolny]], the seat of the Soviet government, 1917]]
On December 7 all invited except Zhydelev and Vasilevsky have gathered in [[Smolny Institute|Smolny]] for a discussion on the issue of competence and structure of the commission in fight with counterrevolution and sabotage. The obligations of the commission were as following, &quot;liquidate to the root all of the counterrevolutionary and sabotage activities and all attempts to them in whole Russia, to hand over counter-revolutionaries and saboteurs to the [[revolutionary tribunal (Russia)|revolutionary tribunal]]s, develop measures to combat them and relentlessly apply them in life. The commission should only conduct a preliminary investigation&quot;. The commission should also observe the press and counterrevolutionary parties, sabotaging officials and other criminals. It was decided to create three sections: informational, organizational, and in fight against counterrevolutionary and sabotage. Upon the end of the meeting Dzerzhinsky reported to the [[Sovnarkom]] with the requested information. The commission was allowed to apply such measures of repression as 'confiscation, deprivation of ration cards, publication of lists of enemies of the people etc.'&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mozokhin&quot;/&gt; That day [[Sovnarkom]] officially confirmed the creation of VCheKa. The commission was created not under the VTsIK as it was previously anticipated, but rather under the Council of the People's Commissars.&lt;ref name=&quot;People's Commissars&quot;&gt;[http://memory.irk.ru/zp1.htm Partial protocol of the 21st session of the Council of the People's Commissars]&lt;/ref&gt;

The next day (December 8) some of the original members of the VCheka were replaced such as Averin, Ordzhonikidze, and Trifonov were replaced by V. V. Fomin, S. E. Shchukin, Ilyin, and Chernov.&lt;ref name=&quot;People's Commissars&quot;/&gt; On the meeting of December 8 the presidium of VChK was elected of five members chaired by Dzerzhinsky. Simultaneously an issue of [[speculation]] was raised at the same meeting which was handed over to Peters to solve and report with results to one of the next meetings of the commission. A circular published on {{OldStyleDate|December 28|1917|December 15}}, gave the address of VCheka's first headquarters as &quot;Petrograd, Gorokhovaya 2, 4th floor&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;People's Commissars&quot;/&gt; On December 11 Fomin was ordered to organize section in fight against speculation. And in the same day VCheKa offered Shchukin to conduct arrests of counterfeiters.

In January 1918 there was organized a subsection of the anti-counterrevolutionary in fight the crime against bank officials positions. The structure of VCheKa was changing repeatedly. By march 1918 at the time of arrival to Moscow it contained following sections: against counterrevolution, speculation, nonresidents, and informational. By the end of 1918-1919 were created secretly operative, investigatory, of transportation, military (special), operative, and instructional. Also there were informational bureau and control-revisionary collegiate. By 1921 it changed once again forming the following sections: directory of affairs, administrative-organizational, secretly operative, economical, and foreign affairs.

===First months===
[[File:Bonch-Bruevich.jpg|thumb|right|140px|Vladimir Bonch-Bruyevich]]
In the first months of its existence VCheKa consisted of only 40 officials. Under its subordination was a team of soldiers of the Sveaborgesky regiment and a group of Red Guardsmen. On January 14, 1918 Sovnarkom ordered Dzerzhinsky to organize teams of ''energetic and ideological'' ones out of sailors in the fight against speculation. So by the spring of 1918 the commission had several teams. Beside the Sveaborge team it had an intelligence team, a team of sailors, and a strike team. Through the winter of 1917-1918 all the activities of VCheKa encompassed mainly the city of Petrograd and was one of the several other commissions that fought against counterrevolution, speculation, banditry, and other dangerous crimes. Other organizations included: Bureau of Military Commissars and Army-Navy investigatory commission to fight a counterrevolutionary element in the [[RKKA|Army]]; Central requisite and unloading Commission to fight speculation; investigation of counterrevolutionary and major criminal offenses was conducting by the Investigatory Commission of Revtribunal. The most closely the functions of VCheKa intertwined with the Commission of [[Vladimir Bonch-Bruyevich|V. D. Bonch-Bruyevich]] which beside the fight against wine pogroms was engaged in the investigation of the most major political offenses (see [[Bonch-Bruyevich Commission]]).


[[Image:Petrovskiy Grigoriy.jpg|thumb|100px|Grigory Petrovsky]]
All results of its activities VCheKa had either transfer to the Investigatory Commission of Revtribunal or dismiss a case. The control of the commission's activity was provided by the [[Ministry of Justice (Soviet Union)|People's Commissariat for Justice]] (Narkomjust, at that time headed by Isidor Steinberg) and Internal Affairs (NKVD, at that time headed by [[Hryhoriy Petrovsky]]). Important fact is that VCheKa although was officially an independent organization from [[NKVD]] its main members such as Dzerzhinsky, [[Martin Latsis|Latsis]], [[Józef Unszlicht|Unszlicht]], and [[Moisei Uritsky|Uritsky]] (all main chekists) since November 1917 composed the collegiate of NKVD headed by Petrovsky. Petrovsky in his turn later (November 1918) was appointed as the head of the All-Ukrainian Central [[Military Revolutionary Committee]] during VCheKa's expansion to provinces and front-lines. At the time of political competition between Bolsheviks and SRs (January 1918), [[Left Socialist-Revolutionaries|Left SRs]] attempted to curb the rights of VCheKa and establish through the Narkomjust its control over its work. Having failed in attempts to subordinate the VCheKa to Narkomjust, the Left SRs were to seek control of the Extraordinary Commission in a different way. They requested that to the Central Committee of they party was granted the right to directly enter the VCheKa their representatives. Sovnarkom has recognized the desirability of including in the composition of collegiate of the Cheka five representatives of Left Socialist-Revolutionary faction of VTsIK. Left SRs were granted the post of a companion (deputy) chairman of VCheKa. However, Sovnarkom, in which the majority belonged to the representatives of RSDLP(b) retained the right to approve members of collegium of the VCheKa.

Originally, the members of the Cheka were exclusively [[Bolshevik]]; however, in January 1918, [[Left Socialist-Revolutionaries|left SRs]] also joined the organization&lt;ref&gt;Schapiro (1984).&lt;/ref&gt; The Left SRs were expelled or arrested later in 1918 following an attempted assassination against Lenin by an SR, [[Fanni Kaplan]].

===Consolidation of VCheKa and its all-national establishment===
By the end of January 1918 the Investigatory Commission of [[Petrograd Soviet]] (probably same as of Revtribunal) addressed [[Sovnarkom]] with a petition to delineate the role of detection and judicial-investigatory organs. It offered to leave for the VCheKa and the Commission of Bonch-Bruyevich only the functions of detection and suppression while investigative functions entirely transfer to it. The petition of the Investigatory Commission was supported. On January 31, 1918 Sovnarkom ordered to relieve VCheKa of the investigative functions, leaving for the commission only the functions of detection, suppression, and prevention of crimes. At the meeting of the Council of People's Commissars on January 31, 1918 was proposed merger of VCheKa and the Commission of Bonch-Bruyevich. The existence of both commissions VCheKa of Sovnarkom and the Commission of Bonch-Bruyevich of VTsIK with almost the same functions and equal rights has become impractical. However, no decision at this time was accepted. It followed only two weeks later.&lt;ref&gt;[[Izvestiya]]. February 28, 1918.&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 23, 1918 VCheKa sent a radio telegram to all soviets with a petition to immediately organize in areas of emergency commissions to combat counter-revolution, sabotage and speculation, if such were not organized yet. February 1918 saw the creation of local extraordinary commissions. One of the first was founded the [[Moscow]] Cheka. Following its example there were starting to be established sections and commissariats to combat counterrevolution in other cities. The Extraordinary Commissions arose, usually in the areas during the moments of the greatest aggravation of political situation. Such on February 25, 1918 in connection with the threat of armed intervention by the counterrevolutionary organization ''Union of front-liners'' was formed a section to combat counter-revolution at the executive committee of the [[Saratov]] Soviet. On March 7, 1918 because of transferring out of Petrograd to Moscow it was decided to create the [[Petrograd]] Cheka. On March 9 was created a section for combating counterrevolution at the [[Omsk]] Soviet. There were also created the extraordinary commissions in [[Penza]], [[Perm]], [[Novgorod]], [[Cherepovets]], [[Rostov]], [[Taganrog]]. On March 18 VCheKa adopted a resolution ''On the work of VCheKa on the All-Russian scale'' foreseeing the formation at all locations a single-type extraordinary commissions and sent a letter, which drew attention on the necessity for the widespread establishment of the Cheka in combating counterrevolution, speculation, and sabotage. Establishment of provincial extraordinary commissions largely was completed in August 1918. At this time in the Soviet Republic was 38 [[guberniya|gubernatorial]] Chekas (Gubcheks).

On June 12, 1918 the I All-Russian Conference of Cheka, adopted the ''Basic provisions on the organization of extraordinary commissions''. There was formulated the task to form extraordinary commissions, not only at [[oblast]] and [[guberniya]] levels, but also at the large [[uyezd]] soviets. In August 1918 in the Soviet Republic had accounted for some 75 uyezd extraordinary commissions. By the end of the year there were established 365 uyezd Cheka. In 1918 the All-Russia Extraordinary Commission and the Soviets managed to establish a local Cheka apparatus. It included oblast, guberniya, [[raion]], [[uyezd]], and [[volost]] Cheka, with raion and volost extraordinary commissioners. In addition, in the system of local Cheka bodies were included security-border Chekas.

In the autumn of 1918 in connection with the consolidation of the political situation of the republic there have appeared a question on the elimination of uyezd, raion, and volost Chekas as well as the institution of extraordinary commissioners. On January 20, 1919 VTsIK adopted a resolution prepared by VCheKa, ''On the abolition of uyezd extraordinary commissions''. On January 16 the presidium of VCheKa approved the draft on the establishment of the Politburo at uyezd [[militsiya]]. This decision was approved by the IV Conference of the Extraordinary Commission, held in early February 1920.

===Other types of Cheka===
On August 3, at VCheKa was created a section of combating counterrevolution, speculation and sabotage on railways. On August 7, 1918 [[Sovnarkom]] adopted a decree on the organization of the Railway section at VCheKa. Combating counterrevolution, speculation, and [[malfeasance]] on railroads was passed under the jurisdiction of the railway section of VCheKa and local Cheka. In August 1918 at Gubcheks have been formed railway sections. Formally, they were part of the non-resident sections, but in fact constituted a separate division, largely autonomous in their activities. The gubernatorial and oblast-type Chekas retained in relationship to the transportation sections only control-investigatory functions.

[[File:Soviet Union stamp 1988 CPA 6011.jpg|thumb|left|175px|[[Martin Latsis]] on the Soviet postage.]]
The beginning of a systematic work of organs of VCheKa in [[RKKA]] refers to July 1918, the period of extreme tension of the [[Russian Civil War|civil war]] and class struggle in the country. On July 16, 1918 the Council of People's Commissars formed the Extraordinary Commission for combating counterrevolution at the Czechoslovak (Eastern) Front led by [[Martin Latsis|M. I. Latsis]]. In the fall of 1918 there began to form extraordinary commissions to combat counterrevolution on the Southern (Ukraine) Front. In late November the II All-Russian Conference of the Extraordinary Commissions accepted a decision after the report of I. N. Polukarov to establish at all frontlines and armies sections of Cheka and granted them right to appoint their commissioners in military units. On December 9, 1918 the collegiate (presumably presidium) of VCheKa had decided to form a military section, headed by [[Mikhail Sergeevich Kedrov|M. S. Kedrov]] to lead the struggle against counterrevolution in the Army. In early 1919 the Military control and the Military section of VCheKa were merged into one body, the Special Section of the Republic. The head of it was appointed Kedrov. On January 1 he issued an order in which he informed on the establishment of the Special Section. Order instructed agencies everywhere to unite the Military control and the Military sections of Chekas and to forme special sections of frontlines, armies, military districts, and [[guberniya]]s.

In November 1920 the [[Soviet of Labor and Defense]] has laid on Special Section of VCheKa the security of the state border. For that purpose there have been set up special sections for protection of borders.

On February 6, 1922 after the IX All-Russian Soviet Congress the Cheka was dissolved by VTsIK &quot;with expressions of gratitude for heroic work.&quot;  It was replaced by the [[State Political Administration]] or [[Gosudarstvennoye Politicheskoye Upravlenie|GPU]], a section of the [[NKVD]] of the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] (RSFSR).

==Operations==
===Suppression of political opposition===
{{See also|Red Terror}}

Initially formed to fight against counter-revolutionaries and saboteurs as well as financial speculators, Cheka classified them in its own manner. Under the category of those counter-revolutionaries fell:
# any civil or military servicemen suspected of working for Imperial Russia,
# families of officers-volunteers (including children),
# any clergy,
# workers and peasants who are under suspicion of not supporting the Soviet government,
# and any other person whose private property was evaluated over 10,000 rubles.

Already according to its name (Extraordinary) the Commission had virtually unlimited powers and could interpret them in any way it wished.  No standard procedures were ever set up except that the Commission was supposed to sent the arrested to the Military-Revolutionary tribunals if outside of a War zone which also could have been interpreted in any way as the whole country was in total chaos. At the direction of Lenin, the Cheka performed mass arrests, imprisonments, and executions of &quot;[[enemies of the people]]&quot;. In this, the Cheka said that they targeted &quot;class enemies&quot; such as the [[bourgeoisie]], and members of the [[clergy]]; the first organized mass repression began against the libertarian Socialists of Petrograd in April 1918. Over the next few months 800 were arrested and shot without trial.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/RUSterror.htm Red Terror]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, within a month the Cheka had extended its repression to all political opponents of the communist government, including anarchists and others on the left.  On April 11–12, 1918, an attack on 26 anarchist political centres in Moscow occurred. 40 anarchists were killed by Cheka forces, about 500 arrested and jailed after a pitched battle took place between them. ( P.Avrich. G Maximoff)  In response to the anarchists' resistance, the Cheka orchestrated a massive retaliatory campaign of repression, executions, and arrests against all opponents of the Bolshevik government in what came to be known as ''[[Red Terror]]''.  The ''Red Terror'', implemented by Dzerzhinsky on September 5, 1918, was vividly described by the [[Red Army]] journal ''Krasnaya Gazeta'':{{quote|Without mercy, without sparing, we will kill our enemies in scores of hundreds. Let them be thousands, let them drown themselves in their own blood. For the blood of Lenin and [[Moisei Uritsky|Uritsky]] … let there be floods of blood of the bourgeoisie – more blood, as much as possible…&lt;ref&gt;page 9, Applebaum (2003).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On September 3, 1918 the newspaper ''[[Izvestiya]]'' published Dzerzhynsky own quote:{{quote|Let the working class squash with a '''mass terror''' the [[Lernaean Hydra|hydra]] of the [[counter-revolution]]! Let the enemies of the working class know that everyone stopped with weapon in arms will be shot in place, that everyone who dares to spread the smallest propaganda against the Soviet government will be promptly arrested and imprisoned in a concentration camp.}}

In the autumn of 1918 the Cheka has openly and proudly announced that it is the terrorist organization in the name of a working class. At the direction of Lenin and Trotsky, the Cheka and Red Army state security forces (later renamed the [[OGPU]]), shot, arrested, imprisoned, and executed thousands of persons, regardless of whether or not they had actually planned rebellion against the Bolshevik government.  Most of the survivors were later deported to Siberian labor camps.

An early Bolshevik [[Victor Serge]] described in his book ''Memoirs of a Revolutionary'':{{quote|Since the first massacres of Red prisoners by the Whites, the murders of Volodarsky and Uritsky and the attempt against Lenin (in the summer of 1918), the custom of arresting and, often, executing hostages had become generalized and legal. Already the Cheka, which made mass arrests of suspects, was tending to settle their fate independently, under formal control of the Party, but in reality without anybody's knowledge. The Party endeavoured to head it with incorruptible men like the former convict Dzerzhinsky, a sincere idealist, ruthless but chivalrous, with the emaciated profile of an [[Inquisitor]]: tall forehead, bony nose, untidy goatee, and an expression of weariness and austerity. But the Party had few men of this stamp and many Chekas. I believe that the formation of the Chekas was one of the gravest and most impermissible errors that the Bolshevik leaders committed in 1918 when plots, blockades, and interventions made them lose their heads. All evidence indicates that [[revolutionary tribunal (Russia)|revolutionary tribunal]]s, functioning in the light of day and admitting the right of defence, would have attained the same efficiency with far less abuse and depravity. Was it necessary to revert to the procedures of the Inquisition?&quot;}}

The Cheka was also used against the armed anarchist [[Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine|Black Army]] of [[Nestor Makhno]] in Ukraine.  After the Black Army had served its purpose in aiding the [[Red Army]] to stop the [[White Army|Whites]] under [[Denikin]], the Soviet communist government decided it must eliminate the anarchist forces.  In May 1919, two Cheka agents sent to assassinate Makhno were caught and executed.&lt;ref&gt;Avrich, Paul, ''Russian Anarchists and the Civil War'', Russian Review, Volume 27, Issue 3 (July 1968), pp. 296-306&lt;/ref&gt;

Many victims of Cheka repression were 'bourgeois hostages' rounded up and held in readiness for [[summary execution]] in reprisal for any alleged counter-revolutionary act. Lenin's dictum that it is better to arrest 100 innocent people than to risk one enemy going free ensured that wholesale, indiscriminate arrests became an integral part of the system.&lt;ref&gt;page 643, Figes (1996).&lt;/ref&gt;

It was during the [[Red Terror]] that the Cheka, hoping to avoid the bloody aftermath of having half-dead victims writhing on the floor, developed a technique for execution known later as the ''Nackenschuss'' or ''Genickschuss'', a shot to the nape of the neck, which caused minimal blood loss and instant death. The victim's head was bent forward and the executioner fired slightly downward at point blank range. This had become the standard method used later by the [[NKVD]] to liquidate [[Joseph Stalin]]'s [[Great Purge|purge]] victims and others.&lt;ref&gt;Paul, Allen. ''Katyn: Stalin's Massacre and the Seeds of Polish Resurrection''. [[United States Naval InstituteGreat Purge|Naval Institute Press]], 1996. ISBN 1557506701 pp. 111-112&lt;/ref&gt;

===Persecution of deserters===
It is believed that more than three million [[deserter]]s escaped from the Red Army in 1919 and 1920. Approximately 500,000 deserters were arrested in 1919 and close to 800,000 in 1920 by troops of the dreaded 'Special Punitive Department' of the Cheka, created to punish desertions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Black&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chamberlain, William Henry, ''The Russian Revolution: 1917-1921'', New York: Macmillan Co. (1957), p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; These troops were used to forcibly repatriate deserters, taking and shooting hostages to force compliance or to set an example. Throughout the course of the civil war, several thousand deserters were shot - a number comparable to that of belligerents during [[World War I]].

In September 1918, according to ''[[The Black Book of Communism]]'' in only twelve provinces of Russia, 48,735 deserters and 7,325 &quot;bandits&quot; were arrested, 1,826 were killed and 2,230 were executed.  The exact identity of these individuals is confused by the fact that the Soviet Bolshevik government used the term 'bandit' to cover ordinary criminals as well as armed and unarmed political opponents, such as the anarchists.

==Number of victims==
Estimates on Cheka executions vary widely. The lowest figures are provided by Dzerzhinsky’s lieutenant [[Martin Latsis|Martyn Latsis]], limited to RSFSR over the period 1918&amp;ndash;1920:

*''For the period 1918-July 1919, covering only twenty provinces of central Russia:''
::1918: 6,300; 1919 (up to July): 2,089; Total: 8,389

*''For the whole period 1918-19:''
::1918: 6,185; 1919: 3,456; Total: 9,641

*''For the whole period 1918-20:''
::January–June 1918: 22; July–December 1918: more than 6,000; 1918-20: 12,733

Experts generally agree these semi-official figures are vastly understated.&lt;ref&gt;pages 463-464, Leggett (1986).&lt;/ref&gt; Pioneering historian of the [[Red Terror]] [[Sergei Melgunov]] claims that this was done deliberately in an attempt to demonstrate the government's humanity. For example, he refutes the claim made by Latsis that only 22 executions were carried out in the first six months of the Cheka's existence by providing evidence that the true number was 884 executions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sergei Melgunov]] [http://www.paulbogdanor.com/left/soviet/redterror.pdf The Record of the Red Terror]&lt;/ref&gt; W. H. Chamberlin claims “it is simply impossible to believe that the Cheka only put to death 12,733 people in all of Russia up to the end of the civil war.”&lt;ref name=&quot;Chamberlin&quot;&gt;pages 74-75, Chamberlin (1935).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Donald Rayfield]] concurs, noting that &quot;plausible evidence reveals that the actual numbers . . . vastly exceeded the official figures.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald Rayfield]]. ''[[Stalin and His Hangmen]]: The Tyrant and Those Who Killed for Him.'' [[Random House]], 2004.

W. Norton &amp; Company; 1st American Ed edition, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Some believe it is possible more people were murdered by the Cheka than died in battle.&lt;ref&gt;page 649, Figes (1996).&lt;/ref&gt;

Lenin himself seemed unfazed by the killings. On 12 January 1920, while addressing trade union leaders, he said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;We did not hesitate to shoot thousands of people, and we shall not hesitate, and we shall save the country.&quot;
&lt;ref&gt;pages 72 &amp; 73, Volkogonov (1998).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On 14 May 1921, the [[Politburo]], chaired by Lenin, passed a motion &quot;broadening the rights of the [Cheka] in relation to the use of the [death penalty].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;page 238, Volkogonov (1994).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Atrocities==
{{Citations missing|section|date=February 2011}}
The Cheka is reported to have practiced [[torture]]. Victims were reportedly skinned alive, scalped, &quot;crowned&quot; with barbed wire, impaled, crucified, hanged, stoned to death, tied to planks and pushed slowly into furnaces or tanks of boiling water, and rolled around naked in internally nail-studded barrels. Chekists reportedly poured water on naked prisoners in the winter-bound streets until they became living ice statues. Others reportedly beheaded their victims by twisting their necks until their heads could be torn off. The [[Chinese in Russian Revolution|Chinese Cheka detachments]] stationed in [[Kiev]] reportedly would attach an iron tube to the torso of a bound victim and insert a rat into the other end which was then closed off with wire netting. The tube was then held over a flame until the rat began gnawing through the victim's guts in an effort to escape. [[Anton Denikin]]'s investigation discovered corpses whose lungs, throats, and mouths had been packed with earth.&lt;ref&gt;pages 177-179, Melg(o)unov (1925).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=R6HAJIJhNp4C&amp;pg=PA383&amp;dq=red+victory+cheka+torture+beatings&amp;ei=JPDrRvHBDY3goALEseCxDw&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;sig=Q2uKWqXLBGbGzwKVQYfnIR-LWaQ#PPA383,M1 pages 383-385], Lincoln (1999).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;page 646, Figes (1996).&lt;/ref&gt;

Women and children were also victims of Cheka terror. Women would sometimes be tortured and raped before being shot. Children between the ages of 8 and 16 were imprisoned and occasionally executed.&lt;ref&gt;page 198, Leggett (1986).&lt;/ref&gt;

All of these atrocities were published on numerous occasions in [[Pravda]] and [[Izvestiya]]: January 26, 1919 Izvestiya #18 articale ''Is it really a medieval imprisonment?'' («Неужели средневековый застенок?»); February 22, 1919 Pravda #12 publishes details of the [[Vladimir]] Cheka's tortures, September 21, 1922 ''Socialist Herald'' publishes details of series of tortures conducted by the [[Stavropol]] Cheka (hot basement, cold basement, scull measuring etc.).

The Chekists were also supplemented by the militarized Units of Special Purpose (the Party's Spetsnaz or {{lang-ru|ЧОН}}).

Cheka was actively and openly utilizing kidnapping methods.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mozohin.ru/article/a-10.html History of governmental bodies of Cheka] {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;В. П. Данилов. «Советская деревня глазами ВЧК-ОГПУ-НКВД», 1918—1922, М., 1998. // РГВА (Российский Государственный Военно-исторический Архив), 33987/3/32.&lt;/ref&gt; With kidnapping methods Cheka was able to extinguish numerous cases of discontent especially among the rural population. Among the notorious ones was the [[Tambov rebellion]].

Villages were bombarded to complete annihilation like in the case of Tretyaki, Novokhopersk uyezd, [[Voronezh Governorate]]. {{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

As a result of this relentless violence more than a few Chekists ended up with psychopathic disorders, which [[Nikolai Bukharin]] said were &quot;an occupational hazard of the Chekist profession.&quot; Many hardened themselves to the executions by heavy drinking and drug use. Some developed a gangster-like slang for the verb to kill in an attempt to distance themselves from the killings, such as 'shooting partridges', of 'sealing' a victim, or giving him a ''natsokal'' (onomatopoeia of the trigger action).&lt;ref&gt;page 647, Figes (1996).&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 30, 1992, by the initiative of the [[President of the Russian Federation]] the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation recognized the Red Terror as unlawful, which in turn led to suspension of the Communist Party of the RSFSR.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

In 1918, Cheka head Felix Dzerzhinsky issued the following instructions:

“Let all those who are assigned to conduct searches, take people into custody, and imprison them behave solicitously toward those being arrested or searched. Let them be much more courteous even than toward close friends. Let them remember that the incarcerated cannot defend themselves and that they are in our power. Each and every one must remember that they represent Soviet power, the workers’ and peasants’ government, and that any verbal abuse, rudeness, injustice, or impropriety is a blot upon the Soviet power.”&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Anton Antonov-Ovseyenko, The Time of Stalin (1981).&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dubious|date=January 2011}}

When a small Moscow journal, Cheka Weekly, published a letter calling for the use of torture, the Cheka responded, “The proletariat is merciless in its struggle. At the same time it is unshakable and strong. Not a single curse at our most wicked enemies. No tortures and torments!”{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} The Presidium of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee, the highest governmental body, passed a decree that read, “Although the Soviet regime resorts of necessity to the most drastic measures of conflict with the counterrevolutionary movement, and remembers that the conflict with the counterrevolution has taken the form of open armed conflict, in which the proletariat and poor peasants cannot renounce the use of terror, the Soviet regime fundamentally rejects the measures advocated in the indicated article, as despicable, dangerous, and contrary to the interests of the struggle for Communism”&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Roy A. Medvedev, Let History Judge (1972).&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dubious|date=January 2011}}

Cheka departments were organized not only in big cities and [[guberniya]] seats, but also in each [[uyezd]], at any front-lines and military formations. Nothing is known on what resources they were created. A lot who was hired to head those departments were so called ''nestlings of [[Alexander Kerensky|Kerensky]]'' ({{lang-ru|птенцы Керенского}}), the former convicts (political and criminal) that released by the Kerensky amnesty.

==In popular culture==
* The Cheka were popular staples in Soviet film and literature. This was partly due to a romanticization of the organisation in the post-Stalin period, and also because they provided a useful action/detection template. Films featuring the Cheka include [[Ostern]]s ''[[Miles of Fire]]'', [[Nikita Mikhalkov]]'s  ''[[At Home among Strangers]]'', the miniseries ''[[The Adjutant of His Excellency]]'', and also ''[[Dead Season]]'' starring [[Donatas Banionis]] and the [[1992 in film|1992]] [[cinema of Russia|Russian]] [[drama film]] ''[[The Chekist]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103949/ Chekist (1992)&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[Spain]], during the [[Spanish Civil War]], the detention and torture centers operated by the Communists were named ''checas'' after the Soviet organization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.firmaspress.com/285.htm International justice begins at home&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] and [[syntax]], a '''clitic''' is a [[morpheme]] that is grammatically independent, but [[phonology|phonologically]] dependent on another word or phrase.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sil.org/linguistics/GlossaryOfLinguisticTerms/WhatIsACliticGrammar.htm SIL Glossary of Linguistic Terms: What is a clitic?]
&lt;/ref&gt; It is pronounced like an [[affix]], but works at the [[phrase]] level.  

Clitics may belong to any grammatical category, though they are commonly [[pronoun]]s, [[Determiner_(linguistics)|determiner]]s, or [[adposition]]s.
Note that [[orthography]] is not a good guide for identifying clitics: clitics may be written as independent words, bound affixes, or separated by special characters (e.g., apostrophe).

==Classification==
There are a number of different clitics depending on their position in relation to the word that they are connected to.

===Proclitic===
A '''proclitic''' appears before its host.
*[[English language|English]]: '''an''' ''apple''
*[[French language|French]]: Je '''t''''''aime''.
::&quot;I '''you'''-''love''.&quot; = &quot;I love you.&quot;
*[[Ancient Greek]]: '''ὁ''' ''ἄνθρωπος''
:::&quot;'''the''' ''person''&quot;

===Enclitic===
An '''enclitic''' appears after its host.
*[[Latin]]: [[SPQR|Senatus ''Populus'''''que''' Romanus]]
::&quot;Senate ''people''-'''and''' Roman&quot; = &quot;The Roman Senate and people&quot;
*[[Ancient Greek]]: ''ánthrōpoí'' ('''te''') ''theoí'' '''te'''
:::&quot;''people'' ('''and''') ''gods'' '''and'''&quot; = &quot;men and gods&quot;

===Mesoclitic===
A '''mesoclitic''' appears between the [[Word stem|stem]] of the host and other affixes.
*[[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]: Ela ''levá''-'''lo'''-''ia''.
:::&quot;She ''take''-'''it'''-&lt;small&gt;''[[conditional mood|COND]]''&lt;/small&gt;.&quot; = &quot;She would take it.&quot;

===Endoclitic===
The '''endoclitic''' splits apart the root and is inserted between the two pieces. Endoclitics defy the [[Lexical Integrity Hypothesis]] ([[Inflection|Lexicalist Hypothesis]]) and so were long claimed to be impossible, but evidence from the [[Udi language]] suggests that they do exist.&lt;ref&gt;

==Properties==
Some clitics can be understood as elements undergoing a historical process of [[grammaticalization]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;
:lexical item → clitic → affix
According to this model, an autonomous lexical item in a particular context loses the properties of a fully independent word over time and acquires the properties of a morphological [[affix]] (prefix, suffix, infix, etc.). At any intermediate stage of this evolutionary process, the element in question can be described as a &quot;clitic&quot;. As a result, this term ends up being applied to a highly heterogeneous class of elements, presenting different combinations of word-like and affix-like properties.

===Prosody===
One characteristic shared by many clitics is a lack of [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosodic]] independence. A clitic attaches to an adjacent word, known as its ''host''. Orthographic conventions treat clitics in different ways: Some are written as separate words, some are written as one word with their hosts, and some are attached to their hosts, but set off by punctuation (a hyphen or an apostrophe, for example).

===Comparison with affixes===
Although the term &quot;clitic&quot; can be used descriptively to refer to any element whose grammatical status is somewhere in between a typical word and a typical affix, linguists have proposed various definitions of &quot;clitic&quot; as a technical term. One common approach is to treat clitics as words that are prosodically deficient: they cannot appear without a host, and they can only form an accentual unit in combination with their host. The term &quot;'''postlexical clitic'''&quot; is used for this narrower sense of the term.

Given this basic definition, further criteria are needed to establish a dividing line between postlexical clitics and morphological affixes, since both are characterized by a lack of prosodic autonomy. There is no natural, clear-cut boundary between the two categories (since from a historical point of view, a given form can move gradually from one to the other by morphologization). However, by identifying clusters of observable properties that are associated with core examples of clitics on the one hand, and core examples of affixes on the other, one can pick out a battery of tests that provide an empirical foundation for a clitic/affix distinction.

An affix syntactically and [[phonology|phonologically]] attaches to a base [[morpheme]] of a limited [[part of speech]], such as a verb, to form a new word.  A clitic syntactically functions above the word level, on the [[phrase]] or [[clause]] level, and attaches only phonetically to the first, last, or only word in the phrase or clause, whichever part of speech the word belongs to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;
The results of applying these criteria sometimes reveal that elements that have traditionally been called &quot;clitics&quot; actually have the status of affixes (e.g. the Romance pronominal clitics discussed [[#Romance languages|below]]).

===Word order===
Clitics do not always appear next to the word or phrase that they are associated with grammatically. They may be subject to global word order constraints that act on the entire sentence. Many [[Indo-European]] languages, for example, obey &quot;[[Jacob Wackernagel|Wackernagel]]'s Law&quot;, which requires clitics to appear in &quot;second position&quot;, after the first syntactic phrase or the first stressed word in a clause: 
*[[Czech language|Czech]]: ''Kde'' '''se''' to stalo? (&quot;''Where'' '''&lt;small&gt;REFL&lt;/small&gt;''' that happened&quot; = &quot;Where did that happen?&quot;)

Several clitics appearing in the same position (sharing the same host) form a &quot;clitic cluster&quot;. The relative order of clitics in a cluster is usually strictly fixed (just as affixes appear in a strict order within a single word):
*Czech: ''Nechtěli'' '''jsme''' '''vám''' '''ho''' dát. (&quot;''&lt;small&gt;NOT&lt;/small&gt;-wanted'' '''&lt;small&gt;1PL&lt;/small&gt;''' '''to-you''' '''it''' give&quot; = &quot;We didn't want to give it to you.&quot;)
*[[Polish language|Polish]]: Ty ''widział'''''byś''' '''go''' jutro. (&quot;you ''saw''-'''&lt;small&gt;COND-2sg&lt;/small&gt;''' '''him''' tomorrow&quot; = &quot;You would see him tomorrow.&quot;)

==Indo-European languages==
===Germanic languages===
====English====
[[English language|English]] enclitics include:
* The abbreviated forms of ''be'':
** ''’m'' in ''I'''’m'''''
** ''’re'' in ''you'''’re'''''
** ''’s'' in ''she'''’s'''''
* The abbreviated forms of [[auxiliary verb]]s:
** ''’ll'' in ''they'''’ll'''''
** ''’ve'' in ''they'''’ve'''''
* The [[genitive case]] (or &quot;possessive&quot;) marker, at least when used to mark an entire [[noun phrase]]: 
**''’s'' in ''The Queen of England's crown''

English proclitics include:
* ''a'' ____ in '''''a''' desk''
* ''an'' ____ in '''''an''' egg''
* ''the'' ____ in '''''the''' house''

The negative marker ''n’t'' as in ''couldn’t'' etc. is often thought to be a clitic developed from the lexical item ''not''. Linguists [[Arnold Zwicky]] and [[Geoffrey Pullum]] argue, however, that the form has the properties of an [[affix]] rather than a syntactically independent clitic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

 |issue= 3
 |author2= Pullum}}&lt;/ref&gt; In English, clitics must be unstressed, but ''not'' as a full word cannot be unstressed.
* I have ''not'' done it yet.
* I’ve ''not'' done it yet.
* I ''haven’t'' done it yet.
* I’ven’t done it yet. (dialectal non-standard)

A stressed word cannot be changed into a clitic:
* I don’t know who she ''is''. (*I don't know who she’s.)
* Have you done it? — Yes, I ''have''.  (*Yes, I’ve.)
* He’s not a fool. — He ''is'' a fool!  (*He’s a fool!)

====Other Germanic languages====
*[[Dutch language|Dutch]]: ''&amp;#39;t'' definite article of neuter nouns and third person singular neuter pronoun, ''&amp;#39;k'' first person pronoun, ''je'' second person singular pronoun, ''ie'' third person masculin singular pronoun, ''ze'' third person plural pronoun
* [[Plautdietsch]]: ''&quot;Deit'a't vondoag?&quot;'': &quot;Will he do it today?&quot;

===Romance languages===
In the [[Romance languages]], the articles and [[object (grammar)|direct and indirect object]] [[personal pronoun]] forms are clitics. In [[Spanish language|Spanish]], for example:

*'''''las''' aguas'' {{IPA|['''laˈs'''aɣwas]}} (&quot;'''the''' waters&quot;)
*'''''lo''' atamos'' {{IPA|['''lo'''aˈtamos]}} (&quot;'''it''' tied-&lt;small&gt;1PL&lt;/small&gt;&quot; = &quot;we tied it&quot;)
*''dá'''melo''''' {{IPA|[ˈda'''melo''']}} (&quot;give '''me it'''&quot;)

According to most criteria, in fact, the pronominal clitics in most of the Romance languages have already developed into affixes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

There is still some debate as to whether or not this change from clitic to affix has occurred with [[French personal pronouns#Subject pronouns|French subject pronouns]].  Subject pronouns, especially, are still considered clitics as they force a topicalized reading of a coindexed [[X-bar theory|XP]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

To illustrate this, consider the following sentences :

*''Je le prends et mange'' (litt. I take and eat it)
*''Je le prends et le mange'' (litt. I take it and eat it)
*''Je le prends et je le mange'' (litt. I take it and I eat it)

The first would be considered quite archaic; out of context, most modern speakers would understand it as &quot;''I take it and eat''&quot;. In this sense, ''le'' can be considered an affix. The second would be understood as is, but would be considered fairly formal. The third would be more informal (and &quot;''je le''&quot; would be likely to be pronounced as &quot;''j'le''&quot; or &quot;''je l'''&quot; here).

Although mesoclisis is extremely formal in [[Brazilian Portuguese]] and tends to be circumscribed in lesser formal registers by avoiding synthetical future/conditional verb forms, [[European Portuguese]] still allows clitic object pronouns to surface as mesoclitics in colloquial situations:&lt;ref&gt;

*''Ela levá-'''lo'''-ia'' (&quot;''She take-'''it'''-would''&quot; — &quot;She would take it&quot;).
*''Eles dar-'''no'''-'''lo'''-ão'' (&quot;''They give-'''us'''-'''it'''-will''&quot; — &quot;They will give it to us&quot;).

===Proto-Indo-European===
In the [[Indo-European language]]s, some clitics can be traced back to [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]]: for example, *''{{PIE|-kʷe}}'' is the original form of [[Sanskrit]] ''[[wikt:च|च]]'' (''-ca''), [[Greek language|Greek]] ''[[wikt:τε|τε]]'' (''-te''), and [[Latin]] ''[[wikt:que#Latin|-que]]''.
*Latin: ''[[wikt:-que#Latin|-que]]'' &quot;and&quot;, ''[[wikt:-ve#Latin|-ve]]'' &quot;or&quot;, ''[[wikt:-ne#Latin|-ne]]'' ([[yes-no question]])
*Greek: ''[[wikt:τε|τε]]'' &quot;and&quot;, ''[[wikt:δέ|δέ]]'' &quot;but&quot;, ''[[wikt:γάρ|γάρ]]'' &quot;for&quot; (in a logical argument), ''[[wikt:οὖν|οὖν]]'' &quot;therefore&quot;
*[[Gothic language|Gothic]]: Sentence clitics appear in second position in accordance with [[Wackernagel's Law]], including ''-u'' ([[yes-no question]]), ''-uh'' &quot;and&quot;, ''þan'' &quot;then&quot;, ''ƕa'' &quot;anything&quot;, for example ''ab-'''u''' þus silbin'' &quot;of thyself?&quot;. Multiple clitics can be stacked up, and will split a [[preverb]] from the rest of the verb if the preverb comes at the beginning of the clause, e.g. ''diz-'''uh-þan'''-sat ijōs'' &quot;and then he seized them (fem.)&quot;, ''ga-'''u-ƕa'''-sēƕi'' &quot;whether he saw anything&quot;.

===Slavic languages===
*[[Russian language|Russian]]: [[wikt:ли|ли]] (yes-no question), [[wikt:же|же]] (emphasis), то (emphasis), [[wikt:не|не]] &quot;not&quot; (proclitic), [[wikt:бы|бы]] (subjunctive)
* [[Czech language|Czech]]: special clitics: weak personal and reflexive pronouns (''mu'', &quot;him&quot;), certain auxiliary verbs (''by'', &quot;would&quot;), and various short particles and adverbs (''tu'', &quot;here&quot;; ''ale'', &quot;though&quot;). &quot;''Nepodařilo '''by se mi mu to''' dát''&quot; &quot;I would not succeed in giving it to him&quot;. In addition there are various simple clitics including short prepositions.

==Other languages==
*[[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]: the marker of indirect questions is ''-e:'' ''Nem tudja még, jön'''-e'''.'' &quot;He doesn't know yet '''if''' he'll come.&quot; This clitic can also mark direct questions with a falling intonation. ''Is'' (&quot;as well&quot;) and ''se'' (&quot;not... either&quot;) also function as clitics: although written separately, they are pronounced together with the preceding word, without stress: ''Ő is jön.'' &quot;He'll come too.&quot; ''Ő sem jön.'' &quot;He won't come, either.&quot;
*[[Japanese language|Japanese]]: all [[Japanese particles|particle]]s, such as the [[genitive case|genitive]] [[postposition]] [[wikt:の#Particle|の]] (''no'') and the [[topic (linguistics)|topic]] marker [[wikt:は#Particle|は]] (''wa'').
*[[Korean language|Korean]]: The copula [[wikt:이다|이다]] (''ida'') and the adjectival [[wikt:하다|하다]] (''hada''), as well as some nominal and verbal particles (e.g. [[wikt:는|는]], ''neun'').&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; However, alternative analysis suggests that the nominal particles do not function as clitics, but as phrasal affixes.&lt;ref name=uiuc_Korean_particles&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[formal language theory]], a '''context-free grammar''' ('''CFG''')
is a [[formal grammar]] in which every [[Production (computer science)|production rule]] is of the form
:''V'' &amp;rarr; ''w''
where ''V'' is a single [[nonterminal]] symbol, and ''w'' is a string of [[Terminal and nonterminal symbols|terminal]]s and/or nonterminals (''w'' can be empty).

The [[formal language|language]]s generated by context-free grammars are known as the [[context-free language]]s.

Context-free grammars are important in [[linguistics]] for describing the structure of sentences and words in [[natural language]], and in [[computer science]] for describing the structure of [[programming language]]s and other artificial languages.

In [[linguistics]], some authors use the term '''[[phrase structure grammar]]''' to refer to context-free grammars.
In [[computer science]], a popular notation for context-free grammars is [[Backus–Naur Form]], or ''BNF''.

== Background ==

Since the time of [[Pāṇini]], at least, linguists have described the [[grammar]]s of languages in terms of their [[block structure]], and described how sentences are [[recursion|recursively]] built up from smaller phrases, and eventually individual words or word elements.

An essential property of these block structures is that logical units never overlap. For example, the sentence:

:: John, whose blue car was in the garage, walked to the green store.

can be logically parenthesized as follows:

:: (John, ((whose blue car) (was (in the garage)))), (walked (to (the green store))).

A context-free grammar provides a simple and mathematically precise mechanism for describing the methods by which phrases in some natural language are built from smaller blocks, capturing the &quot;block structure&quot; of sentences in a natural way. Its simplicity makes the formalism amenable to rigorous mathematical study. Important features of natural language syntax such as [[agreement (linguistics)|agreement]] and [[reference]] are not part of the context free grammar, but the basic recursive structure of sentences, the way in which clauses nest inside other clauses, and the way in which lists of adjectives and adverbs are swallowed by nouns and verbs, is described exactly.

The formalism of context-free grammars was developed in the mid-1950s by [[Noam Chomsky]], and also their [[Chomsky hierarchy|classification as a special type]] of [[formal grammar]] (which he called [[phrase-structure grammar]]s).

In Chomsky's [[generative grammar]] framework, the syntax of natural language was described by a context-free rules combined with transformation rules.
In later work (e.g. Chomsky 1981), the idea of formulating a grammar consisting of explicit rewrite rules was abandoned. In other generative frameworks, e.g. Generalized Phrase Structure Grammar (Gazdar et al. 1985), context-free grammars were taken to be the mechanism for the entire syntax, eliminating transformations.

Block structure was introduced into computer [[programming language]]s by the [[Algol (programming language)|Algol]] project (1957-1960), which, as a consequence, also featured a context-free grammar to describe the resulting Algol syntax. This became a standard feature of computer languages, and the notation for grammars used in concrete descriptions of computer languages came to be known as [[Backus-Naur Form]], after two members of the Algol language design committee.

The &quot;block structure&quot; aspect that context-free grammars capture is so fundamental to grammar that the terms syntax and grammar are often identified with context-free grammar rules, especially in computer science. Formal constraints not captured by the grammar are then considered to be part of the &quot;semantics&quot; of the language.

Context-free grammars are simple enough to allow the construction of efficient [[list of algorithms#Parsing|parsing algorithm]]s which, for a given string, determine whether and how it can be generated from the grammar. An [[Earley parser]] is an example of such an algorithm, while the widely used [[LR parser|LR]] and [[LL parser]]s are simpler algorithms that deal only with more restrictive subsets of context-free grammars.

== Formal definitions ==
A context-free grammar ''G'' is defined by the 4-[[tuple]]:

&lt;math&gt;G = (V\,, \Sigma\,, R\,, S\,)&lt;/math&gt;
where

1. &lt;math&gt;V\, &lt;/math&gt; is a finite set; each element &lt;math&gt; v\in V&lt;/math&gt; is called ''a non-terminal character'' or a ''variable''. Each variable represents a different type of phrase or clause in the sentence. Variables are also sometimes called syntactic categories. Each variable defines a sub-language of the language defined by &lt;math&gt;G\, &lt;/math&gt;.

2. &lt;math&gt;\Sigma\,&lt;/math&gt; is a finite set of ''terminal''s, disjoint from &lt;math&gt;V\,&lt;/math&gt;, which make up the actual content of the sentence. The set of terminals is the alphabet of the language defined by the grammar &lt;math&gt;G\, &lt;/math&gt;.

3. &lt;math&gt;R\,&lt;/math&gt; is a finite relation from &lt;math&gt;V\,&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;(V\cup\Sigma)^{*}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\exist\, w\in (V\cup\Sigma)^{*}: (S,w)\in R&lt;/math&gt;. The members of &lt;math&gt;R\,&lt;/math&gt; are called the ''(rewrite) rule''s or ''production''s of the grammar.

4. &lt;math&gt;S\,&lt;/math&gt; is the start variable (or start symbol), used to represent the whole sentence (or program). It must be an element of &lt;math&gt;V\,&lt;/math&gt;.

The asterisk represents the [[Kleene star]] operation.

For any strings &lt;math&gt;u, v\in (V\cup\Sigma)^{*}&lt;/math&gt;, we say &lt;math&gt;u\,&lt;/math&gt; yields &lt;math&gt;v\,&lt;/math&gt;, written as &lt;math&gt;u\Rightarrow v\,&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;\exists (\alpha, \beta)\in R&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;u_{1}, u_{2}\in (V\cup\Sigma)^{*}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;u\,=u_{1}\alpha u_{2}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v\,=u_{1}\beta u_{2}&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, &lt;math&gt;\! v&lt;/math&gt; is the result of applying the rule &lt;math&gt;\! (\alpha, \beta)&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\! u&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Repetitive rule application ===
For any &lt;math&gt;u, v\in (V\cup\Sigma)^{*}, u\stackrel{*}{\Rightarrow} v&lt;/math&gt; (or &lt;math&gt;u\Rightarrow\Rightarrow v\,&lt;/math&gt; in some textbooks), if &lt;math&gt;\exists u_{1}, u_{2}, \cdots u_{k}\in (V\cup\Sigma)^{*}, k\geq 0&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;u\Rightarrow u_{1}\Rightarrow u_{2}\cdots\Rightarrow u_{k}\Rightarrow v&lt;/math&gt; 

=== Context-free language ===
The language of a grammar &lt;math&gt;G = (V\,, \Sigma\,, R\,, S\,)&lt;/math&gt; is the set
:&lt;math&gt;L(G) = \{ w\in\Sigma^{*} : S\stackrel{*}{\Rightarrow} w\}&lt;/math&gt;

A language &lt;math&gt;L\,&lt;/math&gt; is said to be a context-free language (CFL), if there exists a CFG &lt;math&gt;G\,&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;L\,=\,L(G)&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Proper CFGs ===
A context-free grammar is said to be ''proper'', if it has
* no ''inaccessible'' symbols: &lt;math&gt;\forall N \in V: \exists \alpha,\beta \in V^*: S \stackrel{*}{\Rightarrow} \alpha{N}\beta&lt;/math&gt;
* no ''unproductive'' symbols: &lt;math&gt;\forall N \in V: \exists w \in \Sigma^*: N \stackrel{*}{\Rightarrow} w&lt;/math&gt;
* no ε-productions: &lt;math&gt;\forall N \in V, w \in \Sigma^*: (N, w) \in R \Rightarrow w \neq&lt;/math&gt; ε
* no cycles: &lt;math&gt;\neg\exists N \in V: N \stackrel{*}{\Rightarrow} N&lt;/math&gt;

The grammar G = ({S} , {a, b}, S, P), with productions 
S —&gt; aSa, 
S -&gt; bSb, 
S —A, 
is context-free. A typical derivation in this grammar is 
S =t&gt; aSa =&gt; aaSaa =&gt; aabSbaa =&gt; aabbaa. 
This makes it clear that 
L(G) = {wwH:w?{a,b}*}. 
The language is context-free, but as shown in Example 4.8, it is not regular.

== Examples ==
=== Well-formed parentheses ===

The canonical example of a context free grammar is parenthesis matching, which is representative of the general case. There are two terminal symbols &quot;(&quot; and &quot;)&quot; and one nonterminal symbol S. The production rules are

:S &amp;rarr; SS
:S &amp;rarr; (S)
:S &amp;rarr; ()

The first rule allows Ss to multiply; the second rule allows Ss to become enclosed by matching parentheses; and the third rule terminates the recursion.

Starting with S, and applying the rules, one can construct:

:S &amp;rarr; SS &amp;rarr; SSS &amp;rarr; (S)SS &amp;rarr; ((S))SS &amp;rarr; ((SS))S(S)
:&amp;rarr; ((()S))S(S) &amp;rarr; ((()()))S(S) &amp;rarr; ((()()))()(S)
:&amp;rarr; ((()()))()(())

=== Well-formed nested parentheses and square brackets ===

A second canonical example is two different kinds of matching nested parentheses, described by the productions:

:S &amp;rarr; SS
:S &amp;rarr; ()
:S &amp;rarr; (S)
:S &amp;rarr; []
:S &amp;rarr; [S]

with terminal symbols [ ] ( ) and nonterminal S.

The following sequence can be derived in that grammar:
: ([ [ [ ()() [ ][ ] ] ]([ ]) ])

However, there is no context-free grammar for generating all sequences of two different types of parentheses, each separately balanced disregarding the other, but where the two types need not nest inside one another, for example:

: [ [ [ [(((( ] ] ] ]))))(([ ))(([ ))([ )( ])( ])( ])

=== A regular grammar ===
:S &amp;rarr; a
:S &amp;rarr; aS
:S &amp;rarr; bS

The terminals here are ''a'' and ''b'', while the only non-terminal is S.
The language described is all nonempty strings of &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;s and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;s that end in &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;.

This grammar is [[regular grammar|regular]]: no rule has more than one nonterminal in its right-hand side, and each of these nonterminals is at the same end of the right-hand side.

Every regular grammar corresponds directly to a [[nondeterministic finite automaton]], so we know that this is a [[regular language]].

It is common to list all right-hand sides for the same left-hand side on the same line, using | to separate them. Hence the grammar above can be described more tersely as follows:

:S &amp;rarr; a | aS | bS

=== Matching pairs ===
In a context-free grammar, we can pair up characters the way we do with [[bracket]]s. The simplest example:

:S &amp;rarr; aSb
:S &amp;rarr; ab

This grammar generates the language &lt;math&gt; \{ a^n b^n : n \ge 1 \} &lt;/math&gt;, which is not [[regular language|regular]] (according to the [[Pumping Lemma]] for regular languages).

The special character ε stands for the empty string. By changing the above grammar to
:S &amp;rarr; aSb | ε
we obtain a grammar generating the language &lt;math&gt; \{ a^n b^n : n \ge 0 \} &lt;/math&gt; instead. This differs only in that it contains the empty string while the original grammar did not.

=== Algebraic expressions ===
Here is a context-free grammar for syntactically correct [[Infix notation|infix]] algebraic expressions in the variables x, y and z:
# S → x
# S → y
# S → z
# S → S + S
# S → S - S
# S → S * S
# S → S / S
# S → ( S )

This grammar can, for example, generate the string

:( x + y ) * x - z * y / ( x + x )

as follows:

:S (the start symbol)
: &amp;rarr; S - S (by rule 5)
: &amp;rarr; S * S - S (by rule 6, applied to the leftmost S)
: &amp;rarr; S * S - S / S (by rule 7, applied to the rightmost S)
: &amp;rarr; ( S ) * S - S / S (by rule 8, applied to the leftmost S)
: &amp;rarr; ( S ) * S - S / ( S ) (by rule 8, applied to the rightmost S)
: &amp;rarr; ( S + S ) * S - S / ( S ) (etc.)
: &amp;rarr; ( S + S ) * S - S * S / ( S )
: &amp;rarr; ( S + S ) * S - S * S / ( S + S )
: &amp;rarr; ( x + S ) * S - S * S / ( S + S )
: &amp;rarr; ( x + y ) * S - S * S / ( S + S )
: &amp;rarr; ( x + y ) * x - S * y / ( S + S )
: &amp;rarr; ( x + y ) * x - S * y / ( x + S )
: &amp;rarr; ( x + y ) * x - z * y / ( x + S )
: &amp;rarr; ( x + y ) * x - z * y / ( x + x )

Note that many choices were made underway as to which rewrite was going to be performed next.
These choices look quite arbitrary. As a matter of fact, they are, in the sense that the string finally generated is always the same.  For example, the second and third rewrites

: &amp;rarr; S * S - S (by rule 6, applied to the leftmost S)
: &amp;rarr; S * S - S / S (by rule 7, applied to the rightmost S)

could be done in the opposite order:

: &amp;rarr; S - S / S (by rule 7, applied to the rightmost S)
: &amp;rarr; S * S - S / S (by rule 6, applied to the leftmost S)

Also, many choices were made on which rule to apply to each selected &lt;code&gt;S&lt;/code&gt;.
Changing the choices made and not only the order they were made in usually affects which terminal string comes out at the end.

Let's look at this in more detail.  Consider the [[parse tree]] of this derivation:
 
&lt;code language=&quot;asciitree&quot;&gt;

            S
            |
           /|\
          S - S
         /     \
        /|\    /|\
       S * S  S / S
      /    |  |    \
     /|\   x /|\   /|\
    ( S )   S * S ( S )
     /      |   |    \   
    /|\     z   y   /|\
   S + S           S + S
   |   |           |   |
   x   y           x   x

&lt;/code&gt;

Starting at the top, step by step, an S in the tree is expanded, until no more unexpanded &lt;code&gt;S&lt;/code&gt;es (non-terminals) remain.
Picking a different order of expansion will produce a different derivation, but the same parse tree.
The parse tree will only change if we pick a different rule to apply at some position in the tree.

But can a different parse tree still produce the same terminal string,
which is &lt;code&gt;( x + y ) * x - z * y / ( x + x )&lt;/code&gt; in this case?
Yes, for this particular grammar, this is possible.
Grammars with this property are called [[ambiguous grammar|ambiguous]].

For example, &lt;code&gt;x + y * z&lt;/code&gt; can be produced with these two different parse trees:
 
&lt;code language=&quot;asciitree&quot;&gt;

          S               S
          |               |
         /|\             /|\
        S * S           S + S    
       /     \         /     \
      /|\     z       x     /|\
     x + y                 y * z

&lt;/code&gt;

However, the ''language'' described by this grammar is not inherently ambiguous:
an alternative, unambiguous grammar can be given for the language, for example:

:T &amp;rarr; x
:T &amp;rarr; y
:T &amp;rarr; z
:S &amp;rarr; S + T
:S &amp;rarr; S - T
:S &amp;rarr; S * T
:S &amp;rarr; S / T
:T &amp;rarr; ( S )
:S &amp;rarr; T

(once again picking &lt;code&gt;S&lt;/code&gt; as the start symbol).

=== Further examples ===
==== Example 1 ====
A context-free grammar for the language consisting of all strings over {a,b} containing an unequal number of a's and b's:
:S &amp;rarr; U | V
:U &amp;rarr; TaU | TaT
:V &amp;rarr; TbV | TbT
:T &amp;rarr; aTbT | bTaT | &amp;epsilon;
Here, the nonterminal T can generate all strings with the same number of a's as b's, the nonterminal U generates all strings with more a's than b's and the nonterminal V generates all strings with fewer a's than b's.

==== Example 2 ====
Another example of a non-regular language is &lt;math&gt; \{ b^n a^m b^{2n} : n \ge 0, m \ge 0 \} &lt;/math&gt;. It is context-free as it can be generated by the following context-free grammar:
:S &amp;rarr; bSbb | A
:A &amp;rarr; aA | &amp;epsilon;

==== Other examples ====
The [[First-order_logic#Formation_rules|formation rules]] for the terms and formulas of formal logic fit the definition of context-free grammar, except that the set of symbols may be infinite and there may be more than one start symbol.

Context-free grammars are not limited in application to mathematical (&quot;formal&quot;) languages.
For example, it has been suggested that a class of [[Tamil language|Tamil]] poetry called [[Venpa]] is described by a context-free grammar.&lt;ref&gt;

=== Derivations and syntax trees ===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[LR parser]] --&gt;

A ''derivation'' of a string for a grammar is a sequence of grammar rule applications, that transforms the start symbol into the string.
A derivation proves that the string belongs to the grammar's language.

A derivation is fully determined by giving, for each step:
* the rule applied in that step
* the occurrence of its right hand side to which it is applied
For clarity, the intermediate string is usually given as well.

For instance, with the grammar:

  (1)  S &amp;rarr; S + S
  (2)  S &amp;rarr; 1
  (3)  S &amp;rarr; a

the string

  1 + 1 + a

can be derived with the derivation:

  S
     &amp;rarr; (rule 1 on first S)
  S+S
     &amp;rarr; (rule 1 on second S)
  S+S+S
     &amp;rarr; (rule 2 on second S)
  S+1+S
     &amp;rarr; (rule 3 on second S)
  S+1+a
     &amp;rarr; (rule 2 on first S)
  1+1+a

Often, a strategy is followed that deterministically determines the next nonterminal to rewrite:
* in a ''leftmost derivation'', it is always the leftmost nonterminal;
* in a ''rightmost derivation'', it is always the rightmost nonterminal.
Given such a strategy, a derivation is completely determined by the sequence of rules applied.  For instance, the leftmost derivation

  S
     &amp;rarr; (rule 1 on first S)
  S+S
     &amp;rarr; (rule 2 on first S)
  1+S
     &amp;rarr; (rule 1 on first S)
  1+S+S
     &amp;rarr; (rule 2 on first S)
  1+1+S
     &amp;rarr; (rule 3 on first S)
  1+1+a

can be summarized as

  rule 1, rule 2, rule 1, rule 2, rule 3

The distinction between leftmost derivation and rightmost derivation is important because in most [[parsing|parser]]s the transformation of the input is defined by giving a piece of code for every grammar rule that is executed whenever the rule is applied. Therefore it is important to know whether the parser determines a leftmost or a rightmost derivation because this determines the order in which the pieces of code will be executed. See for an example [[LL parser]]s and [[LR parser]]s.

A derivation also imposes in some sense a hierarchical structure on the string that is derived. For example, if the string &quot;1 + 1 + a&quot; is derived according to the leftmost derivation:

:S &amp;rarr; S + S (1)
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;rarr; S + S + S (1)
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;rarr; 1 + S + S (2)
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;rarr; 1 + 1 + S (2)
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;rarr; 1 + 1 + a (3)

the structure of the string would be:

: { { { 1 }&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; + { 1 }&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; }&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; + { a }&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; }&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;
where { ... }&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; indicates a substring recognized as belonging to S. This hierarchy can also be seen as a tree:

&lt;code language=&quot;asciitree&quot;&gt;
            S
           /|\
          / | \
         /  |  \
        S  '+'  S
       /|\      |
      / | \     |
     S '+' S   'a'
     |     |
    '1'   '1'
&lt;/code&gt;

This tree is called a ''concrete syntax tree'' (see also [[abstract syntax tree]]) of the string. In this case the presented leftmost and the rightmost derivations define the same syntax tree; however, there is another (rightmost) derivation of the same string

:S &amp;rarr; S + S (1)
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;rarr; S + a (3)
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;rarr; S + S + a (1)
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;rarr; S + 1 + a (2)
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;rarr; 1 + 1 + a (2)

and this defines the following syntax tree:

&lt;code language=&quot;asciitree&quot;&gt;
            S 
           /|\
          / | \
         /  |  \
        S  '+'  S
        |      /|\
        |     / | \
       '1'   S '+' S
             |     |
            '1'   'a'
&lt;/code&gt;

If, for certain strings in the language of the grammar, there is more than one parsing tree, then the grammar is said to be an ''[[ambiguous grammar]]''. Such grammars are usually hard to parse because the parser cannot always decide which grammar rule it has to apply. Usually, ambiguity is a feature of the grammar, not the language, and an unambiguous grammar can be found that generates the same context-free language. However, there are certain languages that can only be generated by ambiguous grammars; such languages are called inherently ambiguous.

== Normal forms ==
Every context-free grammar that does not generate the empty string can be transformed into one in which no rule has the empty string as a product [a rule with ε as a product is called an ε-production]. If it does generate the empty string, it will be necessary to include the rule &lt;math&gt;S \rarr \epsilon&lt;/math&gt;, but there need be no other ε-rule. Every context-free grammar with no ε-production has an equivalent grammar in [[Chomsky normal form]] or [[Greibach normal form]]. &quot;Equivalent&quot; here means that the two grammars generate the same language.

Because of the especially simple form of production rules in Chomsky Normal Form grammars, this normal form has both theoretical and practical implications. For instance, given a context-free grammar, one can use the Chomsky Normal Form to construct a [[polynomial-time]] algorithm that decides whether a given string is in the language represented by that grammar or not (the [[CYK algorithm]]).

== Undecidable problems ==
Some questions that are undecidable for wider classes of grammars become decidable for context-free grammars; e.g. the emptiness problem (whether the grammar generates any terminal strings at all), is undecidable for [[context-sensitive grammar]]s, but decidable for context-free grammars.

Still, many problems remain undecidable. Examples:

=== Universality ===

Given a CFG, does it generate the language of all strings over the alphabet of terminal symbols used in its rules? 

A reduction can be demonstrated to this problem from the well-known undecidable problem of determining whether a [[Turing machine]] accepts a particular input (the [[Halting problem]]). The reduction uses the concept of a ''[[computation history]]'', a string describing an entire computation of a [[Turing machine]]. We can construct a CFG that generates all strings that are not accepting computation histories for a particular Turing machine on a particular input, and thus it will accept all strings only, if the machine doesn't accept that input.

=== Language equality ===
Given two CFGs, do they generate the same language?

The undecidability of this problem is a direct consequence of the previous: we cannot even decide whether a CFG is equivalent to the trivial CFG defining the language of all strings.

=== Language inclusion ===
Given two CFGs, can the first generate all strings that the second can generate?

=== Being in a lower level of the Chomsky hierarchy ===
Given a [[context-sensitive grammar]], does it describe a context-free language?
Given a context-free grammar, does it describe a [[regular language]]?

Each of these problems is undecidable.

== Extensions ==
An obvious way to extend the context-free grammar formalism is to allow nonterminals to have arguments, the values of which are passed along within the rules. This allows natural language features such as [[Agreement (linguistics)|agreement]] and [[reference]], and programming language analogs such as the correct use and definition of identifiers, to be expressed in a natural way. E.g. we can now easily express that in English sentences, the subject and verb must agree in number.

In computer science, examples of this approach include [[affix grammar]]s, [[attribute grammar]]s, [[indexed grammar]]s, and Van Wijngaarden [[two-level grammar]]s.

Similar extensions exist in linguistics.

Another extension is to allow additional terminal symbols to appear at the left hand side of rules, constraining their application. This produces the formalism of [[context-sensitive grammar]]s.

== Restrictions ==

There are a number of important subclasses of the context-free grammars:

* [[LR parser|LR(''k'')]] grammars (also known as [[deterministic context-free grammar]]s) allow [[parsing]] (string recognition) with [[deterministic pushdown automaton|deterministic pushdown automata]], but they can only describe [[deterministic context-free language]]s.

* [[SLR grammar|Simple LR]], [[LALR parser|Look-Ahead LR]] grammars are subclasses that allow further simplification of parsing.

* [[LL parser|LL(''k'') and LL(''*'')]] grammars allow parsing by direct construction of a leftmost derivation as described above, and describe even fewer languages.

* [[Simple grammar]]s are a subclass of the LL(1) grammars mostly interesting for its theoretical property that language equality of simple grammars is decidable, while language inclusion is not.

* [[Bracketed grammar]]s have the property that the terminal symbols are divided into left and right bracket pairs that always match up in rules.

* [[Linear grammar]]s have no rules with more than one nonterminal in the right hand side.

* [[Regular grammar]]s are a subclass of the linear grammars and describe the [[regular language|regular]] languages, i.e. they correspond to [[finite automaton|finite automata]] and [[regular expression]]s.

LR parsing extends LL parsing to support a larger range of grammars; in turn, [[GLR parser|generalized LR parsing]] extends LR parsing to support arbitrary context-free grammars.  On LL grammars and LR grammars, it essentially performs LL parsing and LR parsing, respectively, while on nondeterministic grammars, it is as efficient as can be expected.  Although GLR parsing was developed in the 1980s, many new language definitions and [[parser generator]]s continue to be based on LL, LALR or LR parsing up to the present day.

==Linguistic applications==

[[Noam Chomsky|Chomsky]] initially hoped to overcome the limitations of context-free grammars by adding [[transformational grammar|transformation rules]].&lt;ref name=&quot;chomsky1956&quot;/&gt;

Such rules are another standard device in traditional linguistics; e.g. [[grammatical voice|passivization]] in English. Much of [[generative grammar]] has been devoted to finding ways of refining the descriptive mechanisms of phrase-structure grammar and transformation rules such that exactly the kinds of things can be expressed that natural language actually allows. Allowing arbitrary transformations doesn't meet that goal: they are much too powerful, being [[Turing complete]] unless significant restrictions are added (e.g. no transformations that introduce and then rewrite symbols in a context-free fashion).

Chomsky's general position regarding the non-context-freeness of natural language has held up since then,&lt;ref name=&quot;shieber1985&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | title=Evidence against the context-freeness of natural language | year=1985 | last=Shieber | first=Stuart | journal=Linguistics and Philosophy | volume=8 | pages=333–343 | url=http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~shieber/Biblio/Papers/shieber85.pdf | doi=10.1007/BF00630917 | issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; although his specific examples regarding the inadequacy of context-free grammars (CFGs) in terms of their weak generative capacity were later disproved.&lt;ref name=&quot;pullum-gazdar1982&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | title=Natural languages and context-free languages | year=1982 | last=Pullum | first=Geoffrey K. | coauthors=Gerald Gazdar | journal=Linguistics and Philosophy | volume=4 | pages=471–504 | doi=10.1007/BF00360802 | issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Gerald Gazdar]] and [[Geoffrey Pullum]] have argued that despite a few non-context-free constructions in natural language (such as [[cross-serial dependencies]] in [[Swiss German]]&lt;ref name=&quot;shieber1985&quot;/&gt; and [[reduplication]] in [[Bambara language|Bambara]]&lt;ref name=&quot;culy1985&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | title=The Complexity of the Vocabulary of Bambara | year=1985 | last=Culy | first=Christopher | journal=Linguistics and Philosophy | volume=8 | pages=345–351 | doi=10.1007/BF00630918 | issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;), the vast majority of forms in natural language are indeed context-free.&lt;ref name=&quot;pullum-gazdar1982&quot;/&gt;

'''Cryonics''' (from Greek ''kryos-'' meaning ''icy cold'') is the low-temperature preservation of [[human]]s and other [[animal]]s who can no longer be sustained by contemporary [[medicine]], with the hope that healing and [[wikt:resuscitate|resuscitation]] may be possible in the future. [[Cryopreservation]] of people or large animals is not reversible with current technology. The stated rationale for cryonics is that people who are considered dead by current legal or medical definitions may not necessarily be dead according to the more stringent [[Information-theoretic death|information-theoretic definition of death]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Whetstine L et al. 2005 538–542&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Whetstine L, Streat S, Darwin M, Crippen D |title=Pro/con ethics debate: when is dead really dead? |journal=Critical Care |volume=9 |issue=6 |pages=538–42 |year=2005 |pmid=16356234 |pmc=1414041 |doi=10.1186/cc3894}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is proposed that cryopreserved people might someday be recovered by using highly advanced future technology.&lt;ref name=&quot;Merkle RC 1992 6–16&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Merkle RC |title=The technical feasibility of cryonics |journal=Medical Hypotheses |volume=39 |issue=1 |pages=6–16 |year=1992 |month=September |pmid=1435395 |doi=10.1016/0306-9877(92)90133-W}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cryonics procedures ideally begin within minutes of [[cardiac arrest]], and use [[cryoprotectants]] to prevent ice formation during cryopreservation. However, the idea of cryonics also includes preservation of people after longer post-mortem delays because of the possibility that brain structures encoding memory and personality may still persist or be inferable. Whether sufficient brain information still exists for cryonics to work under some preservation conditions may be intrinsically unprovable by present knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Premises of cryonics==
A central [[premise]] of cryonics is that [[long-term memory]], personality, and [[Personal identity (philosophy)|identity]] are stored in durable [[Cell (biology)|cell]] structures and patterns within the [[Human brain|brain]] that do not require continuous brain activity to survive. This premise is generally accepted in medicine; it is known that under certain conditions the brain can stop functioning and still later recover with retention of long-term memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Cryonics is controversial because the technologies of premise (3) are so advanced that premises (1) and (2) are considered irrelevant by most scientists. Whether biological traces of memory or personhood might persist after clinical death is obviously a question of interest. Similarly, outside of cryonics there is no interest in the question of whether memory encoding might survive cryopreservation because the question is regarded as meaningless until cryopreservation can be reversed. At present only cells, tissues, and some small organs can be reversibly cryopreserved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Fahy GM, Wowk B, Wu J |title=Cryopreservation of complex systems: the missing link in the regenerative medicine supply chain |journal=Rejuvenation Research |volume=9 |issue=2 |pages=279–91 |year=2006 |pmid=16706656 |doi=10.1089/rej.2006.9.279}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.4161/org.5.3.9974 |author=Fahy GM, Wowk B, Pagotan R, ''et al.'' |title=Physical and biological aspects of renal vitrification |journal=Organogenesis |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=167–75 |year=2009 |month=July |pmid=20046680 |pmc=2781097}}&lt;/ref&gt; Medical science is primarily concerned with what is demonstrably achievable, not what is theoretically possible. There are therefore no established scientific specialties or [[academic journal|journals]] directly concerned with the scientific questions posed by cryonics.

Cryonics advocates claim that it is possible to preserve the fine cell structures of the brain in which memory and identity reside with present technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url = http://www.alcor.org/Library/html/braincryopreservation1.html| accessdate = 2006-03-17| title = Effect of Human Cryopreservation Protocol on the Ultrastructure of the Canine Brain| last = Platt| first = Charles| publisher = Alcor Life Extension Foundation| year = 1995| work = CryoCare Report| edition = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; They say that demonstrably reversible preservation is not necessary to achieve the present-day goal of cryonics, which is preservation of brain information that encodes memory and personal identity. They believe that current cryonics procedures can preserve the anatomical basis of mind,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Best BP |title=Scientific justification of cryonics practice |journal=Rejuvenation Research |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=493–503 |year=2008 |month=April |pmid=18321197 |doi=10.1089/rej.2008.0661}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that this should be sufficient to prevent [[information-theoretic death]] until future repairs might be possible.

A moral premise of cryonics is that cryopreserving people when there is no other hope is the right thing to do, sometimes even under poor conditions that make the scientific premises of cryonics highly uncertain. Some cryonicists believe as a matter of principle that anyone who would ordinarily be regarded as dead should instead be made a &quot;permanent patient&quot; subject to whatever future advances might bring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Obstacles to success==
=== Preservation injury===
Long-term cryopreservation can be achieved by cooling to near 77.15 [[Kelvin]], the [[boiling point]] of [[liquid nitrogen]]. It is a common mistaken belief that cells will lyse (burst) due to the formation of ice crystals within the cell, since this only occurs if the freezing rate exceeds the osmotic loss of water to the extracellular space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mazur P |title=Freezing of living cells: mechanisms and implications |journal=The American Journal of Physiology |volume=247 |issue=3 Pt 1 |pages=C125–42 |year=1984 |month=September |pmid=6383068 |url=http://ajpcell.physiology.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=reprint&amp;pmid=6383068}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, damage from freezing can still be serious; ice may still form between cells, causing mechanical and chemical damage. Cryonics organizations use [[cryoprotectant]]s to reduce this damage. Cryoprotectant solutions are circulated through blood vessels to remove and replace water inside cells with chemicals that prevent freezing. This can reduce damage greatly,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url = http://www.alcor.org/Library/html/braincryopreservation1.html| accessdate = 2006-03-17| title = New Brain Study Shows Reduced Tissue Damage| last = Platt| first = Charles| publisher = CryoCare Foundation| year = 1995| work = CryoCare Report| edition = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; but freezing of whole people still causes injuries that are not reversible with present technology.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

When used at high concentrations, cryoprotectants stop ice formation completely. Cooling and solidification without freezing is called [[Cryopreservation#Vitrification|vitrification]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Fahy GM, MacFarlane DR, Angell CA, Meryman HT |title=Vitrification as an approach to cryopreservation |journal=Cryobiology |volume=21 |issue=4 |pages=407–26 |year=1984 |month=August |pmid=6467964 |doi=10.1016/0011-2240(84)90079-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first cryoprotectant solutions able to vitrify at very slow cooling rates while still being compatible with tissue survival were developed in the late 1990s by [[Cryobiology|cryobiologists]] [[Greg Fahy|Gregory Fahy]] and [[Brian Wowk]] for the purpose of banking transplantable organs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Fahy GM, Wowk B, Wu J, ''et al.'' |title=Cryopreservation of organs by vitrification: perspectives and recent advances |journal=Cryobiology |volume=48 |issue=2 |pages=157–78 |year=2004 |month=April |pmid=15094092 |doi=10.1016/j.cryobiol.2004.02.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.cryobiol.2005.03.002 |title=Corrigendum to “Cryopreservation of organs by vitrification: perspectives and recent advances” [Cryobiology 48 (2004) 157–178] |year=2005 |last1=Fahy |first1=G |last2=Wowk |first2=B |last3=Wu |first3=J |last4=Phan |first4=J |last5=Rasch |first5=C |last6=Chang |first6=A |last7=Zendejas |first7=E |journal=Cryobiology |volume=50 |pages=344}}&lt;/ref&gt; These solutions were adopted for use in cryonics by the [[Alcor Life Extension Foundation]], for which they are believed to permit [[Cryopreservation#Vitrification|vitrification]] of some parts of the human body, especially the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = New Cryopreservation Technology | publisher = Alcor Life Extension Foundation | month= October | year= 2005 | url = http://www.alcor.org/Library/html/newtechnology.html | accessdate = 2007-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has allowed animal brains to be vitrified, warmed back up, and examined for ice damage using light and [[Electron microscope|electron microscopy]].

Vitrification in cryonics is different than vitrification in mainstream cryobiology because vitrification in cryonics is not reversible with current technology. It is only structural vitrification. When successful it can prevent freezing injury in some body parts, but at the price of toxicity caused by cryoprotectant chemicals. The nature of this toxicity is still poorly understood. Cryonicists assume that toxicity is more subtle and repairable than obvious structural damage that would otherwise be caused by freezing. If, for example, toxicity is due to [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denatured]] [[protein]]s, those proteins could be repaired or replaced.

=== Ischemic injury ===
[[Ischemia]] means inadequate or absent blood circulation that deprives tissue of oxygen and nutrients. At least several minutes of ischemia is a typical part of cryonics because of the common legal requirement that cryonics procedures do not begin until after blood circulation stops. The heart must stop beating so that [[legal death]] can be declared. When there is advance notice of impending [[clinical death]], it is sometimes possible to deploy a team of technicians to perform a “standby”. The team artificially restores blood circulation and breathing using techniques similar to [[CPR]] as soon as possible after the heart stops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Often in cryonics the brain is without oxygen for many minutes at warm temperatures, or even hours if the heart stops unexpectedly. This causes ischemic injury to the brain and other tissues that makes resuscitation impossible by present medical technology. Cryonicists justify preservation under such conditions by noting recent advances that allow brain resuscitation after longer periods of ischemia than the traditional 4-to-6-minute limit, and persistence of brain structure and even some brain cell function after long periods of [[clinical death]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Donaldson-1976&quot;&gt;{{cite book

===Revival===
Those who believe that revival may someday be possible generally look toward advanced [[bioengineering]], [[molecular nanotechnology]],&lt;ref&gt;Nanofactory Collaboration http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/Nanofactory&lt;/ref&gt; [[nanomedicine]],&lt;ref&gt;Robert A. Freitas Jr., Nanomedicine, Landes Bioscience; Vol I (1999), Vol IIA (2003) [http://www.nanomedicine.com Nanomedicine.com]&lt;/ref&gt; or [[mind uploading]] as key technologies. Revival requires repairing damage from lack of oxygen, cryoprotectant toxicity, thermal stress (fracturing), freezing in tissues that do not successfully vitrify, and reversing the effects that caused the patient's death. In many cases extensive [[Regeneration (biology)|tissue regeneration]] will be necessary. Hypothetical revival scenarios generally envision repairs being performed by vast numbers of microscopic organisms or devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

More radically, [[mind transfer]] has also been suggested as a possible revival approach if and when technology is ever developed to scan the memory contents of a preserved brain.

It has sometimes been written that cryonics revival will be a last-in-first-out process. In this view, preservation methods will get progressively better until eventually they are demonstrably reversible, after which medicine will begin to reach back and revive people cryopreserved by more primitive methods. Revival of people cryopreserved by early cryonics technology may require centuries, if it is possible at all.&lt;ref name = &quot;Donaldson-1976&quot;/&gt; People cryopreserved in the future, with better technology, may require less advanced technology to be revived because they will have been cryopreserved with better technology that caused less damage to tissue. The &quot;last in, first out&quot; view of cryonics has been criticized because the quality of cryopreservation depends on many factors other than the era in which cryopreservation takes place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Survival would then depend on whether preserved brain information was sufficient to permit restoration of all or part of the personal identity of the original person, with [[amnesia]] being the final dividing line between success and failure.

==Neuropreservation==
[[Neuropreservation]] is cryopreservation of the brain, often within the head, with surgical removal and disposal (usually cremation) of the rest of the body. Neuropreservation, sometimes called “neuro,” is one of two distinct preservation options in cryonics, the other being &quot;whole body&quot; preservation.

Neuropreservation is motivated by the [[Human brain|brain]]'s role as the primary repository of memory and personal identity. (For instance, spinal cord injury victims, organ transplant patients, and amputees retain their personal identity.) It is also motivated by the belief that reversing any type of cryonic preservation is so difficult and complex that any future technology capable of it must by its nature be capable of generalized [[regeneration (biology)|tissue regeneration]], including growth of a new body around a repaired brain. Some suggested revival scenarios for whole body patients even involve discarding the original body and regenerating a new body because tissues are so badly damaged by the preservation process. These considerations, along with lower costs, easier transportation in emergencies, and the specific focus on brain preservation quality, have motivated many cryonicists to choose neuropreservation.

The advantages and disadvantages of neuropreservation are often debated among cryonics advocates. Critics of neuropreservation note that the body is a record of much life experience, including learned motor skills ([[muscle memory]]). While few cryonicists doubt that a revived neuro patient would be the same person, there are wider questions about how a regenerated body might feel different from the original.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

| publisher = Alcor Life Extension Foundation
| accessdate = 2006-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Partly for these reasons (as well as for better public relations), the [[Cryonics Institute]] preserves only whole bodies. Some proponents of neuropreservation agree with these concerns, but still feel that lower costs and better brain preservation justify concentrating preservation efforts on the brain. About two-thirds of the patients stored at Alcor are neuropreservation patients. Although the [[American Cryonics Society]] no longer offers the neuropreservation option, about half of their patients are &quot;neuros&quot;.

==Financial issues==
Financing storage of a cryonics patient at a cryonics organization by an on-going payment system was done in the early days of cryonics, but this system proved to be unworkable. Cryonics patients are to be stored for many decades, if not a century or two or longer, and a reliable source of outside funding is highly unlikely. Pay-as-you go funding was part of the reason for the CSC Chatsworth financial failure described in the history section. All modern cryonics organizations require full payment for all future costs associated with storage &quot;in perpetuity&quot; before patient cryostorage will be accepted.

Costs of cryonics vary greatly, ranging from the basic fee of $10,000 for neuro (head or brain only) cryopreservation at the European cryonics company [[KrioRus]], to more than $200,000 for whole body cryopreservation by Alcor with overseas and last-minute fees.

The [[Cryonics Institute]] fee does not include “standby” (a team waits for death to occur and begins procedures at bedside), transportation costs, or funeral director expenses outside of Michigan, which must be purchased as extras.

While cryonics is sometimes suspected of being greatly profitable, the high expenses of doing cryonics are well documented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url = http://www.alcor.org/Library/html/CostOfCryonics.html| title = The Cost of Cryonics| last = Darwin| first = Mike| publisher = Alcor Life Extension Foundation| work = Cryonics| year = 1990| accessdate = 2006-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The expenses are comparable to major [[Organ transplantation|transplant]] surgeries. The two most expensive things are standby expenses (a team of 5+ people needs to be hired for up to several weeks) and the money that must be set aside to generate interest to pay for storage of the patient in liquid nitrogen in perpetuity (especially for whole body patients).

The most common method of paying for cryonics is [[life insurance]], which spreads the cost over many years. Cryonics advocates are quick to point out that such insurance is especially affordable for young people. Cryonics providers claim that even the most expensive cryonics plans are “affordable for the vast majority” of people in the industrialized world who really want it and plan for it in advance. With the advent of low-cost cryonics provided by companies such as KrioRus (so far in Europe only) cryonics becomes feasible even for last-minute cases.

==Philosophical and ethical considerations==
Cryonics is based on a view of dying as a process that can be stopped in the minutes, and perhaps hours, following [[clinical death]]. If death is not an event that happens suddenly when the heart stops, this raises philosophical questions about what exactly death is. In 2005 an ethics debate in the medical journal, Critical Care, noted “…few if any patients pronounced dead by today’s physicians are in fact truly dead by any scientifically rigorous criteria.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

[[Ethical]] and [[theological]] opinions of cryonics tend to pivot on the issue of whether cryonics is regarded as [[interment]] or [[medicine]]. If cryonics is interment, then religious beliefs about death and [[afterlife]] may come into consideration. Resuscitation may be deemed impossible by those with religious beliefs because the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] is gone, and according to most religions only [[God]] can resurrect the dead. Cryonics advocates complain that theological dismissal of cryonics because it is interment is a [[circular argument]] because calling cryonics &quot;interment&quot; presumes [[A priori and a posteriori (philosophy)|a priori]] that cryonics cannot work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

If cryonics is regarded as medicine, with [[legal death]] as a mere enabling mechanism, then cryonics is a long-term [[coma]] with uncertain prognosis. It is continuing to care for sick people when others have given up.

authored a paper entitled “Cryonic-Hibernation in Light of the Bioethical Principles of Beauchamp and Childress.” Dr. Tandy considered the four bioethical factors or principles articulated by philosophers Beauchamp and Childress as they apply to cryonics. These four principles are 1) respect for autonomy; 2) nonmaleficence; 3) beneficence; and 4) justice. Tandy concluded that in respect to all four principles “biomedical professionals have a strong (not weak) and actual (not prima facie, but binding) obligation to help insure cryonic-hibernation of the cryonics patient.” &lt;ref&gt;

In 1922 Alexander Yaroslavsky, member of Russian immortalists-biocosmists movement, wrote &quot;Anabiosys Poem&quot;. However, the modern era of cryonics began in 1962 when Michigan college physics teacher [[Robert Ettinger]] proposed in a privately published book, ''The Prospect of Immortality'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first= Robert C.W. | last= Ettinger|  year= 1964 | title= The Prospect of Immortality| edition= First | publisher= Doubleday|url = http://www.cryonics.org/book1.html | isbn= 097434723X}}&lt;/ref&gt; that freezing people may be a way to reach future medical technology. Even though freezing a person is apparently fatal, Ettinger argued that what appears to be fatal today may be reversible in the future. He applied the same argument to the process of dying itself, saying that the early stages of [[clinical death]] may be reversible in the future. Combining these two ideas, he suggested that freezing recently deceased people may be a way to save lives.

Slightly before Ettinger’s book was complete, Evan Cooper&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url = http://www.cryonet.org/cgi-bin/dsp.cgi?msg=23124
| title = Ev Cooper
| publisher = cryonet.org
| accessdate = 2006-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; (writing as Nathan Duhring) privately published a book called ''Immortality: Physically, Scientifically, Now'' that independently suggested the same idea. Cooper founded the Life Extension Society (LES) in 1964 to promote freezing people. Ettinger came to be credited as the originator of cryonics, perhaps because his book was republished by Doubleday in 1964 on recommendation of [[Isaac Asimov]] and [[Fred Pohl]], and received more publicity. Ettinger also stayed with the movement longer. Nevertheless, cryonics historian R. Michael Perry has written “Evan Cooper deserves the principal credit for forming an organized cryonics movement.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| title = Cryonics
| publisher = alcor.org
| accessdate = 2006-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Cooper’s [[Life Extension Society]] became the seed tree for cryonics societies throughout the country where local cryonics advocates would get together as a result of contact through the LES mailing list. The actual word “cryonics” was invented by Karl Werner, then a student in the studio of William Katavolos at Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, NY, in 1965 in conjunction with the founding of the Cryonics Society of New York (CSNY)&lt;ref name=&quot;perry history&quot;&gt;{{cite web

This was followed by the founding of the Cryonics Society of Michigan (CSM) and Cryonics Society of California (CSC) in 1966, and Bay Area Cryonics Society (BACS) in 1969 (renamed the [[American Cryonics Society]], or ACS, in 1985). Neither CSNY nor CSC are currently in operation. CSM eventually became the Immortalist Society, a non-profit affiliate of the [[Cryonics Institute]] (CI), a cryonics service organization founded by Ettinger in 1976. CI now has more current cryonics patients than any other organization.

Although there was at least one earlier aborted case, it is generally accepted that the first person frozen with intent of future resuscitation was Dr. [[James Bedford]], a 73-year-old psychology professor frozen under crude conditions by CSC on January 12, 1967. The case made the cover of a limited print run of ''[[Life Magazine]]'' before the presses were stopped to report the death of three astronauts in the ''[[Apollo 1]]'' fire instead. Bedford is still frozen today at Alcor.&lt;ref name=&quot;perry history&quot;/&gt;

Cryonics suffered a major setback in 1979 when it was discovered that nine bodies stored by the head of the CSC, Robert Nelson, in a cemetery in [[Chatsworth, California]], had thawed due to depletion of funds by relatives, after being maintained for a year and a half at the personal expense of Nelson.&lt;ref name=&quot;perry history&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thislife.org/Radio_Episode.aspx?episode=354 &quot;Mistakes Were Made&quot;], ''[[This American Life]]'', 18 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the bodies had apparently thawed years earlier without notification. Nelson was sued, and negative publicity slowed cryonics growth for years afterward. Of 17 documented cryonics cases between 1967 and 1973, only James Bedford remains [[cryopreservation|cryopreserved]] today. Strict financial controls and requirements adopted in response to the Chatsworth scandal have resulted in the successful maintenance of almost all cryonics cases since that era.

The largest cryonics organization today, in terms of membership, was established as a [[nonprofit organization]] by [[Fred and Linda Chamberlain]] in 1972 as the Alcor Society for Solid State Hypothermia ([[Alcor Life Extension Foundation|ALCOR]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;irs letter&quot;&gt;{{cite web

In 1982, the Institute for Advanced Biological Studies (IABS), founded by [[Mike Darwin]] and Steve Bridge in Indiana, merged with Alcor. During the 1980s, Darwin worked with [[UCLA]] cardiothoracic surgery researcher [[Jerry Leaf]] at Alcor to develop a medical model for cryonics procedures. They pioneered the first consistent use of a cryonics procedure now known as a “standby”, in which a team waits to begin life support procedures at the bedside of a cryonics patient as soon as possible after the heart stops.

The oldest incorporated cryonics society still in existence is the [[American Cryonics Society]] (ACS). This [[Tax exemption|tax-exempt]] [[501(c)(3)]] membership organization was incorporated in 1969 as the Bay Area Cryonics Society (BACS) by a group of cryonics advocates that included two prominent Bay Area physicians, Dr. M. Coleman Harris and Dr. Grace Talbot. The first suspensions under BACS auspices were performed in 1974 by Trans Time, Inc., a for-profit company started by BACS members. BACS researcher Dr. Paul Segall, working with Jerry Leaf of CryoVita, developed a medical model to induce hypothermia shortly after pronouncement of death. Dr. Segall later went on to pioneer blood substitutes for use in both cryonic suspension and in mainstream medicine.

Cryonics received new support in the 1980s when MIT engineer [[Eric Drexler]] started publishing papers and books foreseeing the new field of [[molecular nanotechnology]]. His 1986 book, ''[[Engines of Creation]]'', included an entire chapter on cryonics applications.&lt;ref name=&quot;Note7&quot;&gt;{{cite book

On July 24, 1988, a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in [[computer science]] named Kevin Brown started an [[electronic mailing list]] called ''CryoNet''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url = http://www.cryonet.org/
| title = CryoNet
| accessdate = 2006-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; that became a powerful tool of communication for the cryonics community.

There have been numerous, often transient, for-profit companies involved in cryonics. For-profit companies were often paired or affiliated with non-profit groups they served. Some of these companies, with non-profits they served in parentheses, were Cryonic Interment, Inc.

The cryonics field seems to have largely consolidated around three non-profit groups, Alcor Life Extension Foundation, Cryonics Institute (CI), and the American Cryonics Society (ACS), all deriving significant income from bequests and donations. A newly formed non-profit group called the [[Cryonics Society]] was formally incorporated in 2006 but is devoted solely to promotion and public education of the cryonics concept.

As research in the 1990s revealed in greater detail the damaging effects of freezing, there was a trend to use higher concentrations of glycerol [[cryoprotectant]] to prevent freezing injury. In 2001 Alcor began using [[Cryopreservation#Vitrification|vitrification]], a technology borrowed from mainstream organ preservation research, in an attempt to completely prevent ice formation during cooling. Initially the technology could only be applied to the head when separated from the body. In 2005 Alcor began treating the whole body with their vitrification solution in a procedure called &quot;neurovitrification with whole body cryoprotection&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Cryonics in popular culture ==

Procedures similar to cryonics have been featured in innumerable [[science fiction]] stories to aid space travel (in particular [[interstellar travel]]), or as means to transport a character from the past into the future. In addition to accomplishing whatever the character's primary task is in the future, he or she must cope with the strangeness of a new world, which may contain only traces of their previous surroundings. This prospect of alienation is often cited as a major reason for the unpopularity of cryonics.

Notable early science fiction short stories featuring human cryopreservation, deliberate or accidental, include [[Lydia Maria Child]]'s short story &quot;Hilda Silfverling, A Fantasy&quot; (1886),&lt;ref&gt;Full text of Lydia Maria Child's &quot;Hilda Silfverling, A Fantasy&quot; short story: [http://faculty.pittstate.edu/~knichols/hilda.html] Accessed March 9, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Jack London's first published work &quot;[[A Thousand Deaths]]&quot; (1899), V. Mayakovsky's &quot;Klop&quot; (1928),&lt;ref&gt;[http://briefly.ru/majakovskij/klop/ Briefly.ru]&lt;/ref&gt; H.P. Lovecraft's &quot;[[Cool Air]]&quot; (1928), and Edgar Rice Burroughs' &quot;[[The Resurrection of Jimber-Jaw]]&quot; (1937). Many of the subjects in these stories are unwilling ones, although a 1939 short story by [[Neil R. Jones]] called &quot;The Jameson Satellite&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Ettinger would later write a science fiction story called ''The Penultimate Trump'', published in 1948, in which the explicit idea of cryopreservation of legally dead persons for future repair of medical causes of death is promulgated.&lt;ref&gt;Full text of Ettinger's &quot;Penultimate Trump&quot; short story: [http://www.cryonics.org/Trump.html] Accessed June 8, 2007

Relatively few stories have been published concerning the primary objective and definition of cryonics, which is medical time travel. The most indepth novel based on contemporary cryonics is national best-seller ''[[The First Immortal]]'' by [[James L. Halperin]] (1998). Other novels include ''[[The Door into Summer]]'' by [[Robert A. Heinlein]] (1954), ''[[The Age of the Pussyfoot]]'' by [[Fred Pohl]] (1966) and ''[[Ubik]]'' by [[Philip K.

Fictional application of cryonics as rescue after freezing in space has continued since ''The Jameson Satellite'' in 1931. [[Arthur C. Clarke]]'s ''[[3001: The Final Odyssey]]'' reveals that [[Frank Poole]], murdered by [[HAL 9000]] in ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' was cryopreserved by his exposure to space, and found and revived a thousand years later. The [[Larry Niven]] short story &quot;Wait It Out&quot; depicts a sort of emergency self-cryopreservation by men marooned on Pluto. The 1992 Hugo-winning novel ''[[A Fire Upon the Deep]]'' by [[Vernor Vinge]] features a protagonist who is resuscitated by a superintelligence, thousands of years after a spaceship accident. [[Stanisław Lem]] described cryonic hibernation during space travel in his novel [[The Invincible]], and used cryonic preservation (using device named in a way to suggest [[vitrification]]) as a major plot element in his [[novel Fiasco]]. Cryonics has also been used in [[Eoin Colfer|Eoin Colfer's]] [[Artemis Fowl: The Eternity Code]] (referred as &quot;cryogenics&quot; in the book); [[Domovoi Butler]] was frozen by [[Artemis Fowl II|Artemis Fowl]] after being shot and then revived by [[Captain Holly Short]].&lt;ref&gt;{{AF Cite Book | publisher =Puffin Books | booknumber =3 | year =2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Movies featuring cryonics for medical purposes include the [[Woody Allen]] comedy, ''[[Sleeper (film)|Sleeper]]'', and the films ''[[Late for Dinner]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| publisher = IMDb
| accessdate = 2010-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Abre los Ojos]]'' (remade as ''[[Vanilla Sky]]'') and ''[[Wes Craven's Chiller]]''. One of the most famous movies regarding a cryonics-like process was 1992's ''[[Forever Young (film)|Forever Young]]'', starring Mel Gibson. A &quot;CryoPrison&quot; is where inmates are kept away from society and mentally reformed during their preservation in the film'' [[Demolition Man (film)|Demolition Man]]'', while cryopreservation is used during space travel in the James Cameron films ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'' and ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]''. 2009's ''[[Pandorum]]'' features a form of cryopreservation which, upon waking from, subjects are left disoriented, with amnesia lasting anywhere from days to months, and, in rare instances, suffering from &quot;Pandorum&quot; a type of psychosis. Although not about cryonics per se, the [[Ron Howard]] film ''[[Cocoon (film)|Cocoon]]'' has been hailed by cryonics advocates as expressing the values motivating cryonics better than any other film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

On television, cryonics has appeared occasionally since the late 1960s. An episode of ''[[The Saint]]'' called 'The Man Who Gambled With Life' was made in mid-1968 and focused on a dying multi-millionaire who has himself cryonically preserved. In 1977, an episode of ''[[Barney Miller]]'' included a member of the &quot;Metropolitan New York Cryonic Society.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|518997|Atomic Bomb}}&lt;/ref&gt; Producer [[David E. Kelley]] wrote well-researched portrayals of cryonics for the TV shows ''[[L.A. Law]]'' (1990),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Cryonics was also featured on ''[[Miami Vice]]'' (1987),&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|647118|The Big Thaw}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[SeaQuest DSV]]'' (1994),&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|696961|When We Dead Awaken}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' episode &quot;[[The Neutral Zone (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|The Neutral Zone]]&quot;. In the pilot episode of ''[[Misfits of Science]]'', Arnold &quot;Beef&quot; &quot;Ice Man&quot; Beifneiter was a cryopreserved subject from 1937 who, upon waking, is left simple-minded and with the power to freeze anything he touches, though vulnerable to warmer temperatures and kept cold in an ice cream truck. An episode of ''[[The Golden Girls]]'' includes all four eponymous women cryogenically preserved, but Dorothy, Blanche, and Rose saving only their heads. Sophia, whose body remains intact, informs them they needed &quot;to tip the guy&quot; to be fully preserved. On British TV, cryonics appeared in the last two television works of [[Dennis Potter]], ''[[Karaoke (TV serial)|Karaoke]]'' and ''[[Cold Lazarus]]'', and the long-running series ''[[Doctor Who]]'', as well as its spin-off ''[[Torchwood]]''. Cryonics was also satirized by the American comedy cartoon series ''[[Futurama]]'', with the main character Philip J. Fry accidentally being frozen for 1000 years, to later wake up in the year 2999. The title character [[Aang]] in the animated series ''[[Avatar: The Last Airbender]]'' and [[The Last Airbender|its live action film adaptation]] saved himself from drowning in a tempest by creating an ice bubble, preserving him for about a hundred years. Aurora &lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurora_(telenovela)&lt;/ref&gt; a Spanish-based telenovela by telemundo deals with cryonics. A 20 year old woman is frozen and revived 20 years later, to fall in love with the son of her past love.&lt;ref&gt;http://msnlatino.telemundo.com/novelas/Aurora&lt;/ref&gt;

The most famous known cryopreserved patient is baseball player [[Ted Williams]]. The popular [[urban legend]] that [[Walt Disney]] was cryopreserved is false; he was cremated, and interred at [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Glendale)|Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snopes.com/disney/info/wd-ice.htm Snopes.com]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert A. Heinlein]], who [[The Door into Summer|wrote enthusiastically]] of the concept, was cremated and had his ashes distributed over the [[Pacific Ocean]]. [[Timothy Leary]] was a long-time cryonics advocate, and signed up with a major cryonics provider. He changed his mind, however, shortly before his death, and so was not cryopreserved.

The '''EU patent''' or '''European Union patent''', formerly known as the '''Community patent''', '''European Community Patent''', or '''EC patent''' &lt;ref&gt;See for instance: European Patent Office (EPO) web site, [http://www.epo.org/topics/news/2009/20091208.html ''EU Council agrees on next steps regarding the Community patent (EU patent)''], News, December 8, 2009. Consulted on December 13, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes abbreviated as '''COMPAT''',&lt;ref name=&quot;Stakeholders debate&quot;&gt;European Commission, Internal Market, [http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/smn/smn42/docs/patents_en.pdf ''Stakeholders debate future policy on patents''], Single Market News, Nr. 42, July 2006 (pdf)&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[patent]] law measure being debated within the [[European Union]], which would allow individuals and companies to obtain a unitary patent throughout the European Union.

The EU patent should not be confused with [[European Patent Organisation|European patent]]s which are granted under the [[European Patent Convention]]. European patents, once granted, become a bundle of nationally enforceable patents, in the designated states. This can be expensive for both patentees and third parties in that enforcement must be carried out through national courts in individual countries, and revocation cannot be accomplished centrally once the nine-month [[Opposition procedure before the European Patent Office|opposition period]] has expired. The EU patent is intended to solve these problems, and also to provide a patent right that is consistent across Europe, thus fulfilling one of the key principles of the [[single market|Internal Market]] in that the same market conditions should exist wherever in Europe trade is carried out - different patent rights in different countries presents a distortion of this principle.

In view of the difficulties in reaching an agreement on the community patent,&lt;ref&gt;Axel H. Horns, [http://www.ipjur.com/blog2/index.php?/archives/138-A-Unified-European-Patent-System-The-Historical-Perspective.html#extended A Unified European Patent System - The Historical Perspective], IP::JUR blog, February 18, 2010. Consulted on February 20, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; other legal agreements have been proposed outside the European Union legal framework to reduce the cost of [[translation]] (of patents when granted) and [[lawsuit|litigation]], namely the [[London Agreement (2000)|London Agreement]], which entered into force on May 1, 2008—and which has reduced the number of countries requiring translation of European patents granted nowadays under the European Patent Convention, and the corresponding costs to obtain a European patent&lt;ref&gt;Bruno van Pottelsberghe de la Potterie, Malwina Mejer, [http://www.springerlink.com/content/f861125075v61964/ &quot;The London Agreement and the cost of patenting in Europe&quot;], [[European Journal of Law and Economics]], Vol. 29, Number 2, April, 2010, pages 211-237.&lt;/ref&gt;— and the [[European Patent Litigation Agreement]] (EPLA), which is as of 2010 only a proposal.

==1970s-1980s : Community Patent Convention==
Work on a Community patent started in the 1970s, but the resulting Community Patent Convention (CPC) was a failure.

The &quot;[[Luxembourg]] Conference on the Community Patent&quot; took place indeed in 1975 and the '''Convention for the European Patent for the common market''', or (Luxembourg) Community Patent Convention (CPC), was signed at Luxembourg on December 15, 1975, by the 9 member states of the [[European Economic Community]] at that time. However the CPC never entered into force. It was not ratified by enough countries.

Fourteen years later, the '''Agreement relating to Community patents''', done at Luxembourg on December 15, 1989, was an attempt to revive the project. This Agreement consisted in an amended version of the original Community Patent Convention. But this attempt failed again. Twelve states signed the Agreement, i.e. [[Belgium]], [[Denmark]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Greece]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Italy]], [[Luxembourg]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Portugal]], [[Spain]], and [[United Kingdom]], but only seven ratified it, i.e. [[Denmark]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Greece]], [[Luxembourg]], the [[Netherlands]], and [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Official Journal of the European Patent Office]] 4/2006 p. 328 [http://www.european-patent-office.org/epo/pubs/oj006/04_06/04_3086.pdf (pdf)]&lt;/ref&gt; All states would need to ratify the Agreement to cause it to enter into force.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:41989A0695(01):EN:NOT 89/695/EEC: Agreement relating to Community patents, Done at Luxembourg on 15 December 1989, Article 10]&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, as a minor consolation, a majority of member states of the EEC at that time introduced some harmonisation into their national patent laws in anticipation of the entry in force of the CPC. A more substantive harmonisation took place at around the same time to take account of the European Patent Convention and the [[Convention on the Unification of Certain Points of Substantive Law on Patents for Invention|Strasbourg Convention]].

==2000-2004: EU Regulation==
In 2000, renewed efforts from the European Union resulted in a Community Patent [[European Union regulation|Regulation]] proposal, sometimes abbreviated as '''CPR'''. It provides that the patent, once it has been granted by the European Patent Office (EPO) in one of its procedural languages (English, German or French) and published in that language, with a translation of the claims into the two other procedural languages, will be valid without any further translation. This proposal is aimed to achieve a considerable reduction in translation costs.

Nevertheless, additional translations could become necessary in legal proceedings against a suspected infringer. In such a situation, a suspected infringer who has been unable to consult the text of the patent in the official language of the Member State in which he is domiciled, is presumed, until proven otherwise, not to have knowingly infringed the patent. In order to protect a suspected infringer who, in such a situation, has not acted in a deliberate manner, it is provided that the proprietor of the patent will not be able to obtain damages in respect of the period prior to the translation of the patent being notified to the infringer.

The proposed Community Patent Regulation should also establish a court holding exclusive jurisdiction to invalidate issued patents; thus, a Community Patent's validity will be the same in all EU member states. This court will be attached to the present [[European Court of Justice]] and [[Court of First Instance]] through use of provisions in the [[Treaty of Nice]].

Discussion regarding the Community patent had made clear progress in 2003 when a political agreement was reached on March 3, 2003. However, one year later in March 2004 under the [[Ireland|Irish]] [[Presidency of the Council of the European Union|presidency]], the [[Council of the European Union#Configurations|Competitiveness Council]] failed to agree on the details of the Regulation. In particular the time delays for translating the claims and the authentic text of the claims in case of an [[patent infringement|infringement]] remained problematic issues throughout discussions and in the end proved insoluble.

===Reactions to the failure===
[[Image:ProdiBari.jpg|right|thumb|[[Romano Prodi]] (here on a picture taken in 2006) cited the failure to agree on a Europewide patent as a weak point of his five-year term as [[President of the European Commission]].]]
After the council in March 2004, [[European Commission|EU Commissioner]] [[Frits Bolkestein]] said that &quot;The failure to agree on the Community Patent I am afraid undermines the credibility of the whole enterprise to make Europe the most competitive economy in the world by 2010.&quot; Adding:

{{quote|It is a mystery to me how Ministers at the so-called 'Competitiveness Council' can keep a straight face when they adopt conclusions for the Spring European Council on making Europe more competitive and yet in the next breath backtrack on the political agreement already reached on the main principles of the Community Patent in March of last year. I can only hope that one day the vested, [[protectionism|protectionist]] interests that stand in the way of agreement on this vital measure will be sidelined by the over-riding importance and interests of European manufacturing industry and Europe's competitiveness. That day has not yet come.&lt;ref&gt;[http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=MEMO/04/58 Commission Press Communique, 12th March 2004, &quot;Results of the Competitiveness Council of Ministers, Brussels, 11th March 2004 Internal Market, Enterprise and Consumer Protection issues&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Jonathan Todd, Commission's Internal Market spokesman, declared:
{{quote|Normally, after the common political approach, the text of the regulation is agreed very quickly. Instead, some Member States appear to have changed their positions. (...) It is extremely unfortunate that European industry’s competitiveness, innovation and R&amp;D are being sacrificed for the sake of preserving narrow vested interests.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cordis.europa.eu/itt/itt-en/04-3/policy03.htm cordis.europa.eu, ''Patently unclear'', May 26, 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

European Commission President [[Romano Prodi]], asked to evaluate his five-year term, cites as his weak point the failure of many EU governments to implement the &quot;[[Lisbon Agenda]]&quot;, agreed in 2001. In particular, he cited the failure to agree on a Europewide patent, or even the languages to be used for such a patent, &quot;because member states did not accept a change in the rules; they were not coherent&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wall Street Journal]], October 25, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

===Support for the Regulation===
There is support for the Community patent from various quarters. From the point of view of the European Commission the Community Patent is an essential step towards creating a level playing field for trade within the European Union. For smaller businesses, if the Community patent achieves its aim of providing a relatively inexpensive way of obtaining patent protection across a wide trading area, then there is also support. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

For larger businesses, however, other issues come into play, which have tended to dilute overall support. In general, these businesses recognise that the current European Patent system provides the best possible protection given the need to satisfy national sovereignty requirements such as regarding translation and enforcement. The Community Patent proposal was generally supported if it would do away with both of these issues, but there was some concern about the level of competence of the proposed European Patent Court. A business would be reluctant to obtain a Europe-wide patent if it ran the risk of being revoked by an inexperienced judge. Also, the question of translations would not go away - unless the users of the system could see significant change in the position of some of the countries holding out for more of a patent specification to be translated on grant or before enforcement, it was understood that larger businesses (the bulk of the users of the patent system) would be unlikely to move away from the tried and tested European Patent. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

==2005-today: Stalemate and new debate==
[[Image:Charlie McCreevy portrait.jpg|thumb|left|In 2007, [[Charlie McCreevy]] was quoted as saying that the proposal for an EU-wide patent was stuck in the [[mud]].]]
Thus, in 2005, the Community patent looked unlikely to be implemented in the near future. However, on January 16, 2006 the [[European Commission]] &quot;launched a public consultation on how future action in patent policy to create an EU-wide system of protection can best take account of stakeholders' needs.&quot; The Community patent was one of the issues the consultation focused on.&lt;ref&gt;[http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/06/38&amp;format=HTML&amp;aged=0&amp;language=EN&amp;guiLanguage=en European Commission, Internal Market, ''Commission asks industry and other stakeholders for their views on future patent policy'', Brussels, 16 January 2006,]&lt;/ref&gt; More than 2500 replies were received.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stakeholders debate&quot;/&gt; According to the European Commission, the consultation showed that there is widespread support for the Community patent but not at any cost, and &quot;in particular not on the basis of the Common Political Approach reached by EU Ministers in 2003&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stakeholders debate&quot;/&gt;

In February 2007, [[European Commission|EU Commissioner]] [[Charlie McCreevy]] was quoted as saying:
{{quote|The proposal for an EU-wide patent is stuck in the mud. It is clear to me from discussions with member states that there is no consensus at present on how to improve the situation.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Jones, [http://www.eupolitix.com/EN/News/200702/7be97fa5-3cb6-403f-aadf-103ad99a9950.htm ''McCreevy backs plans for single EU-US market''], TheParliament.com, February 1, 2007. Consulted on February 2, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; }}

The European Commission released a white paper in April 2007 seeking to &quot;improve the patent system in Europe and revitalise the debate on this issue.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Commission of the European Communities,

Consulted on April 20, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; He further said that he believed this could be done within five years.&lt;ref name=&quot;epo 20.04.07&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[CORDIS]] News, [http://cordis.europa.eu/fetch?CALLER=EN_NEWS&amp;ACTION=D&amp;SESSION=&amp;RCN=27536 ''Forum on the future of IP vows to push ahead with Community Patent''], April 20, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2007, the Portuguese [[presidency of the Council of the European Union]] proposed a EU patent jurisdiction, &quot;borrowing heavily from the rejected draft European Patent Litigation Agreement (EPLA)&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Huw Jones, [http://www.reuters.com/article/governmentFilingsNews/idUSL1128205820071011 ''EU president Portugal proposes new patent courts''], Reuters, October 11, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2007, EU ministers were reported to have made some progress towards a community patent legal system, with &quot;some specific results&quot; expected in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Huw Jones, [http://www.guardian.co.uk/feedarticle?id=7097030 ''Ministers make progress along road to EU patent'']{{Dead link|date=September 2009}}, [[The Guardian]], November 22, 2007. Consulted on November 24, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the idea of using [[machine translation]]s to translate patents was proposed to solve the language issue, which is partially responsible for blocking progress on the community patent.&lt;ref&gt;James Nurton, [http://www.managingip.com/Article/1918807/Translation-breakthrough-for-Community-patent.html ''Translation breakthrough for Community patent''], [[Managing Intellectual Property]], Weekly News, April 26, 2008.

Consulted on May 7, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agreement in December 2009, and language issue===
In December 2009, it was reported that the Swedish EU presidency had achieved a breakthrough in negotiations concerning the community patent.

=== Enhanced cooperation ===
[[File:EU Patent.png|thumb|{{legend|#008000|EU patent participants}} {{legend|#0080ff|other EU members}}]]

In December 2010, the use of the [[enhanced cooperation]] procedure was proposed by twelve Member States, in order to set up a unitary patent applicable in all participating European Union Member States.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tait&quot;&gt; Nikki Tait, [http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/fa9b799a-0799-11e0-8d80-00144feabdc0.html#axzz18DVrohfy &quot;Brussels backs ‘single European patent’ plan&quot;], FT.com, December 14, 2010.

Twenty-five Member States have written to the European Commission requesting to participate, with just Spain and Italy remaining outside the enhanced cooperation process, primarily on the basis of ongoing concerns over translation issues. On 15 February, the European Parliament approved the use of the enhanced cooperation procedure by 471 votes to 160.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.europarl.europa.eu/en/pressroom/content/20110215IPR13680/html/EU-patent-Parliament-gives-go-ahead-for-enhanced-cooperation European patent: Parliament gives go ahead for enhanced cooperation], European Parliament, published: 15 February 2011.

{{Companies law}}

'''Companies law''' (or the law of '''business associations''') is the field of [[law]] concerning [[company|companies]] and other business [[organization]]s. This includes [[corporation]]s, [[partnership]]s and other associations which usually carry on some form of economic or charitable activity. The most prominent kind of company, usually referred to as a &quot;corporation&quot;, is a &quot;[[juristic person]]&quot;, i.e. it has separate legal personality, and those who [[shareholder|invest money]] into the business have [[limited liability]] for any losses the company makes, governed by [[corporate law]]. The largest companies are usually publicly listed on [[stock exchange]]s around the world. Even single individuals, also known as [[sole trader]]s may incorporate themselves and limit their liability in order to carry on a business. All different forms of companies depend on the particular law of the particular country in which they reside.

The law of business organizations originally derived from the [[common law]] of [[England]], but has evolved significantly in the 20th century. In common law countries today, the most commonly addressed forms are:

*[[Corporation]]
*[[Limited company]]
*[[Unlimited company]]
*[[Limited liability partnership]]
*[[Limited partnership]]
*[[Not-for-profit corporation]]
*[[Partnership]]
*[[Sole Proprietorship]]

The [[proprietary limited company]] is a statutory business form in several countries, including [[Australia]].

Many countries have forms of business entity unique to that country, although there are equivalents elsewhere. Examples are the [[Limited-liability company]] (LLC) and the [[limited liability limited partnership]] (LLLP) in the United States.

Other types of business organizations, such as [[cooperative]]s, [[credit unions]] and publicly owned enterprises, can be established with purposes that parallel, supersede, or even replace the [[profit maximization]] mandate of business corporations.

For a country-by-country listing of officially recognized forms of business organization, see [[Types of business entity]].

There are various types of company that can be formed in different jurisdictions, but the most common forms of company are:

*''a [[company limited by guarantee]]''. Commonly used where companies are formed for non-commercial purposes, such as clubs or charities. The members guarantee the payment of certain (usually nominal) amounts if the company goes into [[liquidation|insolvent liquidation]], but otherwise they have no economic rights in relation to the company .
*''a company limited by guarantee with a share capital''. A hybrid entity, usually used where the company is formed for non-commercial purposes, but the activities of the company are partly funded by investors who expect a return.
*''a [[Private limited company by shares|company limited by shares]]''. The most common form of company used for business ventures.
*''an [[Unlimited Company|unlimited company]]'' either with or without a share capital. This is a hybrid company, a company similar to its limited company (Ltd.) counterpart but where the members or shareholders do not benefit from limited liability should the company ever go into formal [[liquidation]].

There are, however, many specific categories of corporations and other business organizations which may be formed in various countries and [[jurisdiction]]s throughout the world.

==US companies law==
In the [[United States]], corporations are generally [[incorporation (business)|incorporated]], or organized, under the laws of a particular [[U.S. state|state]]. The corporate law of a corporation's state of incorporation generally governs that corporation's internal governance (even if the corporation's operations take place outside of that state). The corporate laws of the various states differ - in some cases significantly - from state to state. Because of these differences, corporate [[lawyers]] are often consulted in an effort to determine the most appropriate or advantageous state in which to incorporate, and a majority of public companies in the U.S. are [[Delaware corporation]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.state.de.us/corp/aboutagency.shtml Delaware Division of Corporations]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[federal law|federal laws of the United States]] and local law may also be applicable sources of corporate law.

==Companies law theory==
“A corporation is described to be a person in a political capacity created by the law, to endure in perpetual succession.”&lt;ref name=&quot;Wil&quot;&gt;Wilson, James. Lectures on Law, delivered 1790-91 at University of Pennsylvania, Vol. II, ch. X, “Of corporations.”&lt;/ref&gt; Americans in the 1790s knew of a variety of corporations established for various purposes, including those of commerce, education, and religion. As the law of corporations was articulated by the Supreme Court under [[John Marshall|Chief Justice Marshall]], over the first several decades of the new American state, emphasis fell, in a way which seems natural to us today, upon commercial corporations. Nonetheless, Wilson believed that, in all cases, corporations “should be erected with caution, and inspected with care.” The actions of corporations were clearly circumscribed: “To every corporation a name must be assigned; and by that name alone it can perform legal acts.” For non-binding external actions or transactions, corporations enjoyed the same latitude as private individuals; but it was with an eye to internal affairs that many saw principal advantage in incorporation. The power of making by-laws was “tacitly annexed to corporations by the very act of their establishment.”&lt;ref name=&quot;Wil&quot; /&gt; While they must not directly contradict the overarching laws of the land, the central or local government cannot be expected to regulate toward the peculiar circumstances of a given body, and so “they are invested with authority to make regulations for the management of their own interests and affairs.”&lt;ref name=&quot;Wil&quot; /&gt;

The question then arises: if corporations are to be inspected with care, what - if not the commercial or social conduct, or the by-laws - is to be inspected – and by whom? Do corporations have duties? Yes: “The general duties of every corporation may be collected from the nature and design of its institution: it should act agreeably to its nature, and fulfill the purposes for which it was formed.”&lt;ref name=&quot;Wil&quot; /&gt; Who sees that corporations are living up to those duties? “The law has provided proper persons with proper powers to visit those institutions, and to correct every irregularity, which may arise within them.”&lt;ref name=&quot;Wil&quot; /&gt; The Common Law provided for inspection by the court of king’s bench. In 1790, at least, “the powers of the court of king's bench [were] vested in the supreme court of Pennsylvania.”&lt;ref name=&quot;Wil&quot; /&gt; As for the dissolution of corporations, there seems not to have been much question that a corporation might “surrender its legal existence into the hands of that power, from which it was received. From such a surrender, the dissolution of the body corporate ensues.”&lt;ref name=&quot;Wil&quot; /&gt; Nor does there seem to have been much question that by “a judgment of forfeiture against a corporation itself, it may be dissolved.”&lt;ref name=&quot;Wil&quot; /&gt; However, Supreme Court Justice Wilson, lecturing in his unofficial capacity, at least, suggests his displeasure with the doctrine that corporate dissolution cannot be predicated “by a judgment of ouster against individuals. God forbid ― such is the sentiment of Mr. Justice Wilmot ― that the rights of the body should be lost or destroyed by the offenses of the members.”&lt;ref name=&quot;Wil&quot; /&gt;

As theorists such as [[Ronald Coase]] have pointed out, all business organizations represent an attempt to avoid certain costs associated with doing business. Each is meant to facilitate the contribution of specific resources - investment capital, knowledge, relationships, and so forth - towards a venture which will prove profitable to all contributors. Except for the partnership, all business forms are designed to provide [[limited liability]] to both members of the organization and external investors. Business organizations originated with [[agency (law)|agency law]], which permits an agent to act on behalf of a principal, in exchange for the principal assuming equal liability for the wrongful acts committed by the agent. For this reason, all partners in a typical general partnership may be held liable for the wrongs committed by one partner. Those forms that provide limited liability are able to do so because the state provides a mechanism by which businesses that follow certain guidelines will be able to escape the full liability imposed under agency law. The state provides these forms because it has an interest in the strength of the companies that provide jobs and services therein, but also has an interest in monitoring and regulating their behavior.

==Companies law study==
[[Law school]]s typically offer either a single upper level course on business organizations, or offer several courses covering different aspects of this area of law. The area of study examines issues such as how each major form of business entity may be formed, operated, and dissolved; the degree to which limited liability protects investors; the extent to which a business can be held liable for the acts of an [[Agent (law)|agent]] of the business; the relative advantages and disadvantages of different types of business organizations, and the structures established by governments to monitor the buying and selling of [[Stock|ownership interests]] in large corporations.

The basic theory behind all business organizations is that, by combining certain functions within a single entity, a business (usually called a [[wiktionary:firm|firm]] by economists) can operate more efficiently, and thereby realize a greater profit. Governments seek to facilitate investment in profitable operations by creating rules that protect investors in a business from being held personally liable for [[debts]] incurred by that business, either through mismanagement, or because of wrongful acts committed by the business{{cite}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{About|Commonwealth the term|the Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth of Nations|other uses}}

'''Commonwealth''' is a traditional English term for a political community founded for the common good. Historically, it has sometimes been synonymous with &quot;[[republic]]&quot;.

More recently it has been used for fraternal associations of some sovereign nations. Most notably, the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], an association primarily of former members of the [[British Empire]], is often referred to as simply &quot;the Commonwealth&quot;.

==Etymology==
The [[England|English]] noun ''commonwealth'' in the sense meaning &quot;public welfare; general good or advantage&quot; dates from the 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite |title=Commonwealth |journal=Oxford English Dictionary |publisher=dictionary.oed.com | date=1989, 2nd ed. | accessdate=13 March 2010 |url=http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50045157?query_type=word&amp;queryword=commonwealth&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10&amp;sort_type=alpha&amp;result_place=1&amp;search_id=Hr0v-iyV0EE-153&amp;hilite=50045157}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original phrase &quot;the common-wealth&quot; or &quot;the common weal&quot; (echoed in the modern synonym &quot;public weal&quot;) comes from the old meaning of &quot;wealth,&quot; which is &quot;well-being.&quot; The term literally meant &quot;common well-being&quot;. In the 17th century the definition of &quot;commonwealth&quot; expanded from its original sense of &quot;public welfare&quot; or &quot;commonweal,&quot; to mean &quot;a state in which the supreme power is vested in the people; a republic or democratic state.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot; Better things were done, and better managed ... under a Commonwealth than under a King.&quot; Pepys, ''Diary'' (1667)  {{cite |title=Commonwealth |journal=Oxford English Dictionary |publisher=dictionary.oed.com | date=1989, 2nd ed. | accessdate=13 March 2010 |url=http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50045157?query_type=word&amp;queryword=commonwealth&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10&amp;sort_type=alpha&amp;result_place=1&amp;search_id=Hr0v-iyV0EE-153&amp;hilite=50045157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historic usage==
===Iceland===
The [[Icelandic Commonwealth]] or the [[Icelandic Free State]] (Icelandic: Þjóðveldið) was the state existing in Iceland between the establishment of the [[Althing]] in 930 and the pledge of fealty to the [[King of Norway|Norwegian king]] in 1262. It was initially established by a public consisting largely of recent immigrants from [[Norway]] who had fled the unification of that country under [[King]] [[Harald Fairhair]].

===Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, Commonwealth of Poland===
{{Main|Rzeczpospolita}}
''Republic'' is still an alternative translation of the traditional name of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. [[Wincenty Kadłubek]] (Vincent Kadlubo, 1160–1223) used for the first time the original Latin term ''res publica'' in the context of Poland in his &quot;Chronicles of the Kings and Princes of Poland.&quot; The name was used officially for the confederal country formed by [[Poland]] and [[Lithuania]] 1569–1795.

It is also often referred as &quot;[[Golden Liberty|Nobles' Commonwealth]]&quot; (1505–1795, i.e. before the union).
In contemporary political doctrine of [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], &quot;our state is a Republic (Commonwealth) under presidency of the King.&quot; The commonwealth introduced a doctrine of religious tolerance (see [[Warsaw Confederation]]), had its own parliament ''[[Sejm]]'' (although elections were restricted to the gentry or ''[[szlachta]]'') and elected kings, who were bound to certain contracts ''[[Pacta conventa (Poland)|Pacta conventa]]'' from the beginning of the reign. The foundation stones of the Commonwealth (also called the Golden Freedoms) used to be
* [[Elective monarchy|free election]] of the king
* ''[[Pacta conventa (Poland)|Pacta conventa]]'', a binding pledge agreed to by the King on his election
* ''[[rokosz]]'', the right of rebellion against kings who did not rule in accordance with their pledge
* ''[[liberum veto]]'' (a later development), the right for a single representative to veto the entire proceedings of the Sejm
* ''[[Confederation (Poland)|confœderatio]]'' ([[confederation]]), a military organisation of the citizens for the attainment of common political aims.

&quot;A commonwealth of good counsaile&quot; was the title of
the 1607 English translation of the work of [[Wawrzyniec Grzymała Goślicki]] &quot;De optimo senatore&quot; that presented to English readers many of the ideas present in the political system of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.

===United Kingdom===
The [[Commonwealth of England]] was the official name of the political unit (de facto military rule in the name of parliamentary supremacy) that replaced the kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]] and [[Kingdom of England|England]] (after the [[English Civil War]]) from 1649 to 1653 and 1659 to 1660. Under the rule of [[Oliver Cromwell]] and his son and successor [[Richard Cromwell|Richard]] from 1653 to 1659, although still legally known as a Commonwealth, the republic operated under different institutions (at times as a ''de facto'' monarchy) and is known by historians as the Protectorate. The Commonwealth of England formed the first [[republic]] in the [[Anglosphere|English-speaking world]]. In a British context, it is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Old Commonwealth&quot;.

Labour MP [[Tony Benn]] introduced a [[Commonwealth of Britain Bill]] several times between 1991 and 2001, intended to abolish the monarchy and establish a British republic. It never reached [[second reading]].

==National==
===Australia===
The term also served when six Australian [[colony|colonies]] [[Federation of Australia|federated]] to form the [[Australia|Commonwealth of Australia]] in 1901. The [[Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act]] created a federal system, in which power is divided between the federal, or national, government and the [[States and territories of Australia|States]] — the evolved status of the colonies. The Constitution stipulated that Australia was a [[constitutional monarchy]], where the [[Head of State]] is the British (or, since 1942, Australian) monarch, who is represented at the federal level by a Governor-General, and at the state level by six Governors, one for each state. The [[Parliament of Australia]] was derived from the British and American systems to form a uniquely Australian system. It is largely based on the British [[Westminster System]], adopting many of its practices and precedents, but with a similar structure — [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], and [[Australian Senate|Senate]] — to the U.S. Congress. In an Australian context, the term &quot;Commonwealth&quot; (capitalised) thus refers to the [[Government of Australia|federal government]] and &quot;Commonwealth of Australia&quot; is the official name of the country.

===Dominica===
The small [[Caribbean]] republic of [[Dominica]] has used the official style ''Commonwealth of Dominica'' since 1970.

===The Bahamas===

[[The Bahamas]], a [[Commonwealth realm]], uses the official style ''Commonwealth of The Bahamas''.

==United States==
===U.S. states===

{{Main|Commonwealth (U.S. state)}}

Four [[U.S. state|states]] in the [[United States]] officially designate themselves as &quot;commonwealths&quot;:

*'''[[Kentucky]]''' is designated a commonwealth by the [[Kentucky Constitution]] and is known as the “Commonwealth of Kentucky”.&lt;ref&gt;http://kentucky.gov:  copyright 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''[[Massachusetts]]''' is a commonwealth,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mass.gov:  copyright 2009&lt;/ref&gt; declaring itself as such in its constitution, which states that &quot;The body politic is formed by a voluntary association of individuals: it is a social compact, by which the whole people covenants with each citizen, and each citizen with the whole people, that all shall be governed by certain laws for the common good.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.malegislature.gov/Laws/Constitution#cp00s00.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''[[Pennsylvania]]''' uses the &quot;Commonwealth of Pennsylvania&quot; as its official title.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pa.gov:  copyright 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''[[Virginia]]''' has been known as the &quot;Commonwealth of Virginia&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.virginia.gov:  copyright 2009&lt;/ref&gt; since before joining the United States.[http://www.virginia.gov]

===U.S. insular areas===
{{Main|Commonwealth (U.S. insular area)}}
&quot;Commonwealth&quot; is also used in the U.S. to describe the political relationship between the [[United States]] and the overseas [[incorporated territory|unincorporated territories]]:

* '''[[Commonwealth of the Philippines]]''' — formed in 1934, and became independent in 1946.

* '''[[Puerto Rico]]''' — became a commonwealth&lt;ref&gt;http://welcome.topuertorico.org/government.shtml:  copyright 2009&lt;/ref&gt; in 1952.

* '''[[Northern Mariana Islands]]''' — became a commonwealth in 1978.

==International==
===Commonwealth of Nations===
The [[Commonwealth of Nations]] — formerly the &quot;British Commonwealth&quot; — is a voluntary association of 54 independent sovereign states, most of which are former [[British Empire|British colonies]], or dependencies of these colonies with three exceptions, [[Mozambique]] (which was a [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese possession]]), [[Rwanda]] (which was a [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[League of Nations mandate|mandate]]) and [[Cameroon]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thecommonwealth.org/YearbookInternal/145151/history/&lt;/ref&gt; (which is a union of a [[France|French]] mandate and a British mandate) plus the United Kingdom itself. The Commonwealth's membership includes both republics and monarchies. The head of the Commonwealth of Nations is [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]]. She also reigns as monarch directly in a number of states, known as [[Commonwealth realm]]s, notably the [[United Kingdom]], [[Australia]], [[Barbados]], [[Canada]], [[Jamaica]], and [[New Zealand]]. The Commonwealth of Nations is sometimes referred to as the New Commonwealth in a British context.

===Commonwealth of Independent States===
The [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] (CIS) is a loose [[military alliance|alliance]] or confederation consisting of 10 of the 15 [[Post-Soviet states|former Soviet Republics]], the exceptions being [[Turkmenistan]](Associate Member), [[Lithuania]], [[Latvia]], [[Estonia]] and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] left the CIS in August 2008 after a clash with [[Russia]] over [[South Ossetia]]. Its creation signaled the dissolution of the [[Soviet Union]], its purpose being to &quot;allow a civilized divorce&quot; between the [[Republics of the Soviet Union|Soviet Republics]]. The CIS has developed as a forum by which the member-states can co-operate in [[economics]], [[Defense (military)|defense]] and [[foreign policy]].

      <comment>/* The drive head misalignment issue */  [[MOS:TITLE]]</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Commodore64 fdd1541 front demodified.jpg|thumb|Front view of the most common version of the '''Commodore 1541''' disk drive, with open disk slot. This version uses a Newtronics drive mechanism, and the rotating lever is used to hold the disk in place.]][[Image:Commodore64 fdd1541 back.jpg|thumb|Back panel view of the '''Commodore 1541''' disk drive.]]The '''Commodore 1541''' (aka '''CBM 1541''', and originally called '''VIC-1541'''), made by [[Commodore International]], was the best-known [[floppy disk]] drive for the [[Commodore 64]] [[home computer]]. The 1541 was a single-sided 170 [[kilobyte]] drive for 5¼&quot; disks. The 1541 followed the previous [[Commodore 1540]] (meant for the [[Commodore VIC-20|VIC-20]]).

The disk drive used [[Group Code Recording]] (GCR) and contained a [[MOS Technology|MOS]] [[MOS Technology 6502|6502]] microprocessor, doubling as a [[disk controller]] and on-board [[disk operating system]] processor. The number of sectors per track varied from 17 to 21 (an early implementation of [[Zone Bit Recording]]). The drive's built-in disk operating system was [[Commodore DOS|CBM DOS 2.6]].

==Disk capacity==
Each side of 170 [[kilobyte|kB]]s was split into 683 sectors on 35 tracks, each of the sectors holding 256 [[byte]]s; the [[file system]] made each sector individually rewritable.

However, since one track had to be used by the drive itself for directory and file allocation information (so-called BAM, [[Block allocation map|Block Allocation Map]]) and two bytes of each physical sector were used as a &quot;block&quot; pointer to the next physical track and sector (as to implement interleave for faster access), a logical block would hold 254 out of 256 bytes. 

If the disk was not otherwise prepared with a custom format, (e.g. for data disks), 664 blocks would be free after formatting, giving 168,656 bytes (or almost 165 kB) for user data.

By using custom formatting and load/save routines (sometimes included in third-party DOSes, see below), all of the mechanically possible 40 tracks could be used. The reason why Commodore decided not to use the upper five tracks by default (or at least more than 35) was the bad quality of some of the drive mechanisms which did not always work reliably at the highest tracks. So by reducing the number of tracks used and thus capacity, it was possible to further reduce cost - in contrast to Double Density drives used e.g. in [[IBM PC]] computers of the day which saved 180 kB on one side (by using a 40 tracks format).

The 1541 did not have an index hole sensor, making it straightforward to use the reverse side of a disk by flipping it. A disc could be converted to a &quot;flippy disk&quot; by simply cutting/punching a notch on the left-hand side, causing the drive to recognize both sides as writable. This would effectively double the storage capacity. The notch could be made with a [[knife]], single hole [[paper punch]], or &quot;disk notcher&quot; tool that was specifically designed for this task. To achieve the same effect on other drives would normally have also required an extra cut-out for the index hole — a harder modification.

For compatibility and ease of implementation, the 1571's Double Sided format of one logical disk side with 70 tracks later was created by putting together the 35 physical tracks on each of the physical sides rather than using two times 40 (or e.g. 38) tracks, even though there were no more quality problems with the mechanisms of those drives. The 1571 [[CP/M]] format, however, uses the full 360 kB available on that two R/W head drive.

==Introduction and early problems==
Priced at under [[United States dollar|US$]]400 at its introduction, the 1541 became widely popular. Although expensive by today's standards, a C64 plus a 1541 cost about $900, while an [[Apple II family|Apple II]] with no disk drive cost $1395. The demand caught Commodore by surprise, and they struggled to produce the drive in adequate quantities.

Failure rates on the 1541 initially were very high, and the drives were virtually impossible to find. The lead editorial in the December 1983 issue of ''[[Compute!'s Gazette]]'' lamented that four of the seven drives the magazine had in its editorial offices had failed. Eventually the problems subsided and the drive became nearly as widely available as the C64 itself.

The 1541 did not have dip switches to change the drive number. If a user added more than one drive to a system the user had to open the case and cut a trace in the circuit board to permanently change the drive's number, or hand-wire an external switch to allow it to be changed externally. It was also possible to change the number temporarily from the operating system.

The 1541 also had an internal power source, which generated some heat. The heat generation was a frequent source of humour. For example, series of humorous tips in ''[[MikroBitti]]'' 5/1989 said &quot;When programming late, [[coffee]] and [[kebab]] keep nicely warm on top of the 1541.&quot; The ''MikroBitti'' review of the 1541-II said that its external power source &quot;should end the jokes about toasters&quot;.

The early 1541's had a spring eject mechanism (Alps Drive), and the discs often failed to release. This style of drive had the popular nickname &quot;Toaster Drive&quot;, because it required the use of a knife or other thin object to pry out the stuck media just like a piece of toast stuck in a real toaster. This was fixed later, when Commodore changed the vendor of the drive mechanism ([[Mitsumi]]) and went to a flip handle that allowed extraction of the disc using your fingers, and no longer requiring the spring.

==Versions and third-party clones==
[[File:Commodore 1541 white.jpg|thumb|1541C, the first upgrade version]]
There were two versions of the 1541 mechanics. Early models used a drive mechanism made by [[Alps Electric]], distinguishable by its push-down drive door. Later models utilized a drive mechanism manufactured by Newtronics ([[Mitsumi]]), which used a lever release. All but the very earliest 1541s can use either the Alps or Newtronics mechanism. Visually, the first models, of the ''VIC-1541'' denomination, had an off-white color like the VIC-20 and VIC-1540. Then, to match the look of the C64, [[Commodore International|CBM]] changed the drive's color to brown-beige and the name to ''Commodore 1541''.

[[Image:C64-IMG 5372.jpg|thumb|'''Commodore 1541-II''', the second of two upgraded versions of the CBM 1541. The 1541-II has the more modern &quot;radial handle&quot; locking mechanism.]]
The 1541's numerous shortcomings opened a market for a number of third-party clones of the disk drive, a situation that continued for the lifetime of the C64. Well-known clones were the ''Oceanic OC-118'' aka ''Excelerator+'', ''MSD'' 's single and dual drives, the ''Enhancer 2000'', the ''Indus GT'', and ''[[Creative Micro Designs|CMD]]'' 's ''FD-2000'' and ''FD-4000''. Nevertheless, the 1541 became the first disk drive to see widespread use in the home and Commodore sold millions of the units.

In 1986, Commodore released the '''1541C''', a revised version that offered quieter and slightly more reliable operation and a light beige case matching the color scheme of the Commodore 64C. It was replaced in 1988 by the '''1541-II''', which used an external power supply to provide cooler operation and allow the drive to have a smaller desktop footprint (the power supply &quot;brick&quot; being placed elsewhere, typically on the floor).

==The serial computer interface==
The 1541 used a bit-serial version of the [[IEEE-488]] interface, the speedier parallel version of which was used on Commodore's earlier drives for the [[Commodore PET|PET/CBM]] range of personal/business computers. To ensure a ready supply of inexpensive cabling for its home computer peripherals, Commodore chose standard [[DIN connector]]s for the serial interface. Disk drives and other peripherals such as printers were connected to the computer via a [[Daisy chain (electrical engineering)|daisy chain]] scheme, necessitating only a single connector on the computer itself.

Initially, Commodore intended to use a hardware shift register (the [[MOS Technology 6522|6522 VIA]]) to maintain relatively brisk drive speeds with the new serial interface. However, a hardware bug with this chip prevented the initial design from working as anticipated, and the ROM code was hastily rewritten to handle the entire operation in software. According to [[Jim Butterfield]], this caused a speed reduction by a factor of five.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.binarydinosaurs.co.uk/Museum/Commodore/c64/c64notes.php&lt;/ref&gt;

As implemented on the [[VIC-20]] and [[Commodore 64]], [[Commodore DOS|CBM DOS]] could transfer only about 300 bytes per second, which translated to about 20 minutes to copy one disk&amp;mdash;10 minutes of reading time, and 10 minutes of writing time. However, since both the computer and the drive could easily be reprogrammed, third parties quickly wrote more efficient firmware that would speed up drive operations drastically. Without hardware modifications, some &quot;[[fast loader]]&quot; utilities managed to achieve speeds of up to 4 kB/s. The most common of these products were the [[Epyx FastLoad]], the [[The Final Cartridge III|Final Cartridge]], and the [[Action Replay (cartridge)|Action Replay]] plug-in [[cartridge (electronics)|cartridge]]s, which all had [[machine code monitor]] and [[disk editor]] software on board as well. The popular Commodore computer magazines of the era also entered the arena with type-in fast-load utilities, with ''[[Compute!'s Gazette]]'' publishing ''TurboDisk'' in 1985 and ''[[RUN (magazine)|RUN]]'' publishing ''Sizzle'' in 1987.

Even though each 1541 had its own on board disk controller and disk [[operating system]], it was not possible for a user to command two 1541 drives to copy a disk (one drive reading and the other writing) as with older dual drives like the [[Commodore 4040|4040]] and [[Commodore 8050|8050]] that were often found with the PET computer, and which the 1541 was backward compatible to (it could read 4040 disks but not write to them since its internal Operating System was essentially the same). Unfortunately, however, the routines in the 1541 disk operating system to enable disk copy were removed as it was intended to be a stand-alone unit. To copy from drive to drive, software running on the C64 was needed and it would first read from one drive into memory, then write out to the other. Only later when first [[Fast Hack'em]] then other disk backup programs were released was true drive to drive copying possible. One could then (in theory at least) unplug the C64 itself from the drives (i.e. from the first drive in the daisy chain) and do something else with the computer as the drives proceeded to copy the entire disk.  This is not a recommended practice as disconnecting the serial lead from a powered drive and/or computer frequently resulted in destruction of one or both of the port chips in the disk drive.

==Copy protection by read error==
Early [[copy protection]] schemes deliberately introduced read errors on the disk, the software refusing to load unless the correct error message was returned. The general idea was that the inbuilt disk copy command was incapable of copying the errors. When one of these errors was encountered, the disk drive (as do all disk drives) would attempt one or more re-read attempts after first resetting the head to track zero. Few of these schemes had much deterrent effect, as various software companies soon released &quot;nibbler&quot; utilities that enabled protected disks to be copied.

==The drive head misalignment issue==
The drive-head mechanism was notoriously easy to misalign, and had a tendency to make a &quot;machine-gun&quot; rattle when out of alignment or when formatting a new disk.  Some people even wrote code to vibrate the head at different frequencies to play simple tunes such as &quot;[[Daisy Bell]]&quot;, &quot;[[Amazing Grace]]&quot;, and, perhaps most appropriately, &quot;[[When I'm Sixty-Four]]&quot;.  The most common cause of the 1541's drive head knocking and subsequent misalignment, however, was copy protection schemes on commercial software.

The main cause of the problem was that the disk drive itself did not feature any means of detecting when the read/write head had reached track zero. Accordingly, when a disk was formatted or a disk error occurred, the unit would physically drive the head 40 tracks to track zero (although the 1541 DOS only used 35 tracks, the drive itself was a 40 track unit). Once track zero was reached, the head would be physically rammed against a solid stop. This ramming gave the characteristic &quot;machine gun&quot; noise and would, sooner or later, throw the head out of alignment.

There were at least one or two &quot;home remedy&quot; software products on the market during the heyday of the 1541 drive and Commodore 64 computer that could be used to re-align the drive yourself and save a costly trip to a repair center and down time. They generally consisted of a software program and a calibration disk. What the user would do is remove the drive from its case and then loosen the screws holding the stepper motor that moved the head. Then with the calibration disk in the drive gently turn the stepper motor back and forth until the program showed a good alignment. The screws were then tightened and the drive put back into its case. The real problem actually was that the sprocket which moved the head would slip on the stepper motor shaft after repeated hammering and this would put the drive gradually out of alignment.  

The later [[Commodore 1571|1571]] drive (which was 1541 compatible) incorporated track zero detection and was thus immune to the problem. A third-party fix for the 1541 appeared where the solid head stop was replaced by a sprung stop, giving the head a much easier life. Also, a software solution, which resided in the drive controller's ROM, could prevent the re-reads from occurring, though this could cause problems when genuine errors did occur.

==Commodore's successor products==
The [[Commodore 1570]] was an upgraded 1541 for use with the [[Commodore 128]], available in Europe. It offered [[Modified Frequency Modulation|MFM]] capability for accessing CP/M disks, improved speed, and somewhat quieter operation, but was only manufactured until Commodore got its production lines going with the double-sided [[Commodore 1571|1571]]. Finally, the small, external power supply, MFM-based [[Commodore 1581]] 3½&quot; drive was made, giving 800 KB access to the C128 and C64. By this time, however, many CBM users had shifted their attention to the 16/32-bit [[Amiga]], and the 1581 was mostly sold to remaining [[GEOS (8-bit operating system)|GEOS]] users.

The '''Commodore 1581''' is a 3½ inch [[double sided]] [[double density]] [[floppy disk]] drive made by [[Commodore International|Commodore Business Machines (CBM)]] primarily for its [[Commodore 64|C64]] and [[Commodore 128|C128]] [[home computer|home]]/[[personal computer]]s. The drive stores 800 [[kilobyte]]s using an [[Modified Frequency Modulation|MFM]] encoding&lt;ref name=dd81&gt;[http://personalpages.tds.net/~rcarlsen/cbm/1581.txt tds.net - 1581 DISK DRIVE DIAGNOSTICS, latest updates and corrections 7-13-05]&lt;/ref&gt; but format different from both [[MS-DOS]] (720 kB), and the [[Amiga]] (880 kB) formats. With special software it's possible to read C1581 disks on a x86 PC system. And read MS-DOS disks in the C1581 (Big blue reader) provided the PC floppy handles the &quot;720 kB&quot; size format.&lt;ref name=dd81/&gt; It was released in the summer of [[1987]] and quickly became popular with [[bulletin board system|bulletin board system (BBS)]] operators and other users.

Like the [[Commodore 1541|1541]] and [[Commodore 1571|1571]], the 1581 has an on board [[MOS Technology 6502]] CPU with its own ROM and RAM, and uses a serial version of the [[IEEE-488]] interface. Inexplicably, the drive's ROM contains commands for parallel use, although no parallel interface was available. Like the 1571, it can read various other disk formats using special software. This capability was most frequently used to read MS-DOS disks. However, unlike the 1571, which is nearly 100% backward-compatible with the 1541, the 1581 has limited compatibility with Commodore's earlier drives. Although it responds to the same DOS commands, most disk utilities written prior to 1987, most notably fast loaders, are so 1541-specific that they do not work with the 1581.

The version of [[Commodore DOS]] built into the 1581 added support for [[Disk partitioning|partitions]], which could also function as fixed-allocation [[Directory (file systems)|subdirectories]].  PC style subdirectories were rejected as being too difficult to work with in terms of  Block Allocation Maps, then still much in vogue, and which for some time had been the traditional way of inquiring into block availability.  When used together with the C128, it implements faster [[burst mode]] access than the [[Commodore 1571]] 5¼&quot; drive.  When using the 1581 together with the older C64, however, it is almost as slow as the older 1541 drive, due to limitations of the C64's ROM code. The 1581 provides a total of 3160 blocks free when formatted (a block being equal to 256 [[byte]]s). The number of permitted directory entries was also increased, to 288 entries. With a storage capacity of 800 KB, the 1581 was the highest capacity serial bus drive ever made by Commodore (the 1 MB SFD-1001 used the parallel IEEE-488), and the only 3½&quot; one.  However, starting in 1991, [[Creative Micro Designs|Creative Micro Designs (CMD)]] made the [[CMD FD-2000|FD-2000]] [[high density]] (1.6&amp;nbsp;MB) and [[CMD FD-4000|FD-4000]] [[extended density]] (3.2&amp;nbsp;MB) 3½&quot; drives, both of which offered not only a 1581 emulation mode but also 1541 and 1571 compatibility modes.

Like the [[Commodore 1541|1541]] and [[Commodore 1571|1571]], a nearly identical [[job queue]] is available to the User in [[Zero page]] (except for Job 0), providing for exceptional degrees of compatibility.

Unlike the case of the 1541 and 1571, the low-level disk format used by the 1581 is similar enough to the MS-DOS format as the 1581 is built around a [[Western Digital FD1771|WD1770]] FM/MFM floppy controller chip. PC Floppy controllers (ISA or onboard, but not USB floppy drives) are able to deal with the 1581 format without need for any special tricks. Thus, utilities to format, read, and write 1581-format disks in standard PC floppy drives under [[Linux]] or [[Microsoft Windows]] exist. This controller chip, however, was the seat of some early problems with 1581 drives when the first production runs were recalled due to a high failure rate; the problem was quickly corrected. Later versions of the 1581 drive had a smaller, more streamlined looking external power supply provided with them.

'''College football''' refers to [[American football]] played by teams of student athletes fielded by American universities, colleges, and [[United States military academies|military academies]], or [[Canadian football]] played by teams of student athletes fielded by Canadian universities. It was through college football play that American football rules first gained popularity in Canada and the United States.

==History==
{{Main|History of American football|History of Canadian football}}

[[Image:College football TT USNA.jpg|thumb|upright|A college football game between [[Texas Tech Red Raiders football|Texas Tech]] and [[Navy Midshipmen football|Navy]]]]

Modern North American football has its origins in various games, all known as &quot;[[American football|football]]&quot;, played at [[Public school (UK)|public schools]] in [[England]] in the mid-19th century. By the 1840s, students at [[Rugby School]] were playing a game in which players were able to pick up the ball and run with it, a sport later known as [[Rugby football]]. The game was taken to [[Canada]] by British soldiers stationed there and was soon being played at Canadian colleges. 
The first documented gridiron football match was a game played at University College, University of Toronto November 9, 1861 on the present site of University College (400 yards west of Queen's Park). One of the participants in the game involving University of Toronto students was (Sir) William Mulock, later Chancellor of the school. A football club was formed at the university soon afterward, although its rules of play at this stage are unclear.[2]

In 1864, at Trinity College, Toronto, F. Barlow Cumberland and Frederick A. Bethune devised rules based on rugby football. However, modern Canadian football is widely regarded as having originated with a game of rugby played in Montreal, in 1865, when British Army officers played local civilians.[2] The game gradually gained a following, and the Montreal Football Club was formed in 1868, the first recorded non-university football club in Canada.

The [[1869 college football season#First football game ever played|first game]] of intercollegiate &quot;[[American football|football]]&quot; between two colleges from the United States was an unfamiliar ancestor of today's college football, as it was played under 99-year-old [[soccer]]-style Association rules.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scarletknights.com/football/history/first-game.asp - note that the [[London Football Association]]'s rules were adopted at the time&lt;/ref&gt; [[1869 college football season#First football game ever played|The game]] was played between teams from [[Rutgers University]] and [[Princeton University]], which was called the College of New Jersey at the time. It took place on November 6, 1869 at College Field, which is now the site of the [[College Avenue Gymnasium]] at [[Rutgers University]] in [[New Brunswick, New Jersey]]. Rutgers won by a score of 6 &quot;runs&quot; to Princeton's 4.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nfl.com/history/chronology/1869-1910 NFL History] at the National Football League website, accessed 10 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ruweb.rutgers.edu/timeline/1800fr.htm Rutgers Through the Years] (timeline), published by Rutgers University (no further authorship information available), accessed 12 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scarletknights.com/tradition/tradition.asp Tradition] at www.scarletknights.com. Published by Rutgers University Athletic Department (no further authorship information available), accessed 10 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[1869 college football season#First football game ever played|The 1869 game]] between [[Rutgers University|Rutgers]] and [[Princeton University|Princeton]] is important in that it is the first documented game of intercollegiate football game ever played between two American colleges, and because of this, [[Rutgers University]] is often referred to as ''The Birthplace of College Football''. It is also notable in that it came a full-two years before a codified rugby game would be played in England. The Rutgers-Princeton game was undoubtedly different from what we today know as American football. Nonetheless it was the forerunner of what evolved into American football. Another similar game took place between [[Rutgers University]] and [[Columbia University]] in 1870 and the popularity of intercollegiate competition in football would spread throughout the country.
[[Image:1882RutgersFootballTeam.jpg|thumb|234px|The Rutgers College football team in 1882.]]

The American experience with the rugby-style game that led directly to present-day college football continued in 1874 at a meeting in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], [[Massachusetts]] between [[Harvard University]] and [[Montreal]]'s [[McGill University]]. The McGill team played a [[rugby union]]-style game, while Harvard played under a set of rules that allowed greater handling of the ball than soccer. The teams agreed to play under compromise rules. The Harvard students took to the rugby rules and adopted them as their own.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.athletics.mcgill.ca/varsity_sports_article.ch2?article_id=111 Infamous 1874 McGill-Harvard game turns 132] at McGill Athletics, published by McGill University (no further authorship information available). This article incorporates text from the ''McGill University Gazette'' (April 1874), two issues of ''The Montreal Gazette'' (14 May and 19 May 1874). Accessed 29 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Walter Camp - Project Gutenberg eText 18048.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Walter Camp]], the &quot;Father of American Football&quot;, pictured here in 1878 as the captain of the Yale Football team]]

The first intercollegiate football game that most resembles today's game was between [[Tufts University]] and Harvard on June 4, 1875 at Jarvis Field in Cambridge, Massachusetts, won by Tufts 1-0.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, R.A. &quot;Sports and Freedom: The Rise of Big-Time College Athletics&quot;, New York: Oxford University Press, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; A report of the outcome of this game appeared in the Boston Daily Globe of June 5, 1875. Jarvis Field was at the time a patch of land at the northern point of the Harvard campus, bordered by Everett and Jarvis Streets to the north and south, and Oxford Street and Massachusetts Avenue to the east and west. In the Tufts/Harvard game, participants were allowed to pick up the ball and run with it, each side fielded eleven men, the ball carrier was stopped by knocking him down or &quot;tackling&quot; him, and the inflated ball was egg-shaped &amp;ndash; the combination of which marks this game as the first game of American football. A photograph of the 1875 Tufts team commemorating this milestone hangs in the [[College Football Hall of Fame]] in [[South Bend, Indiana]]. Harvard and [[Yale University|Yale]] also began play in 1875 though under rules that made their game, as well as the aforementioned Princeton/Rutgers game, significantly different from what we know as American Football compared to the Tufts/Harvard contest which is more closely the antecedent to American Football than these other games. The [[The Rivalry (Lehigh–Lafayette)|longest running rivalry]] and most played game between two American colleges is between [[Lafayette College]] and [[Lehigh University]].

[[Walter Camp]], known as the &quot;Father of American Football&quot;, is credited with changing the game from a variation of rugby into a unique sport. Camp is responsible for pioneering the play from scrimmage (earlier games featured a rugby [[Scrum (rugby)|scrum]]), most of the modern elements of scoring, the eleven-man team, and the traditional offensive setup of the seven-man line and the four-man backfield. Camp also had a hand in popularizing the game. He published numerous articles in publications such as ''[[Collier's Weekly]]'' and ''[[Harper's Weekly]]'', and he chose the first [[College Football All-America Team]].[[Image:RobinsonThrowing.jpg|thumb|upright|1906 ''[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]'' photograph of [[Bradbury Robinson|Brad Robinson]], who threw the first legal forward pass]]

College football increased in popularity through the remainder of the 19th century. It also became increasingly violent. In 1905, President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] threatened to ban the sport following a series of player deaths from injuries suffered during games. The response to this was the formation of what became the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA), which set rules governing the sport. The rules committee considered widening the playing field to &quot;open up&quot; the game, but [[Harvard Stadium]] (the first large permanent football stadium) had recently been built at great expense; it would be rendered useless by a wider field.  The rules committee legalized the [[forward pass]] instead.  The first legal pass was thrown by [[Bradbury Robinson]] on September 5, 1906, playing for coach [[Eddie Cochems]], who developed an early but sophisticated passing offense at [[Saint Louis University]]. Another rule change banned &quot;mass momentum&quot; plays (many of which, like the infamous &quot;[[flying wedge]]&quot;, were sometimes literally deadly).

Even after the emergence of the professional [[National Football League]] (NFL), college football remained extremely popular throughout the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sev.prnewswire.com/sports/20070109/NYTU17309012007-1.html While Still the Nation's Favorite Sport, Professional Football Drops in Popularity - Baseball and college football are next in popularity] at the Harris Interactive website, accessed 28 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Although the college game has a much larger margin for talent than its pro counterpart, the sheer number of fans following major colleges provides a financial equalizer for the game, with Division I programs &amp;ndash; the highest level &amp;ndash; playing in huge stadiums, six of which have seating capacity exceeding 100,000. In many cases, college stadiums employ bench-style seating, as opposed to individual seats with backs and arm rests.  This allows them to seat more fans in a given amount of space than the typical professional stadium, which tends to have more features and comforts for fans.

College athletes, unlike professionals, are not permitted by the NCAA to be paid salaries. Many do receive [[athletic scholarship]]s and financial assistance from the university.

==Official rules and notable rule distinctions==
{{See also|American football rules}}
[[File:harvard crimsons v brown 2009.JPG|thumb|A night game between Harvard and Brown, September 25, 2009]]
Although rules for the high school, college, and NFL games are generally consistent, there are several minor differences. The NCAA Football Rules Committee determines the playing rules for Division I (both Bowl and Championship Subdivisions), II, and III games (the [[National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics]] (NAIA) is a separate organization, but uses the NCAA rules).
*A pass is ruled complete if one of the receiver's feet is inbounds at the time of the catch. In the NFL both feet must be inbounds.
*A player is considered down when any part of his body other than the feet or hands touches the ground or when the ball carrier is tackled or otherwise falls and loses possession of the ball as he contacts the ground with any part of his body, with the sole exception of the holder for field goal and extra point attempts. In the NFL a player is active until he is tackled or forced down by a member of the opposing team (down by contact).
*The clock stops after the offense completes a first down and begins again—assuming it is following a play in which the clock would not normally stop—once the referee declares the ball ready for play. In the NFL the clock does not explicitly stop for a first down.
*Overtime was introduced in 1996, eliminating ties. When a game goes to overtime, each team is given one possession from its opponent's twenty-five yard line with no game clock, despite the one timeout per period and use of play clock. The team leading after both possessions is declared the winner. If the teams remain tied, overtime periods continue, with a coin flip determining the first possession. Possessions alternate with each overtime, until one team leads the other at the end of the overtime. Starting with the third overtime, a one point PAT field goal after a touchdown is no longer allowed, forcing teams to attempt a two-point conversion after a touchdown. (In the NFL overtime is decided by a 15-minute [[Overtime (sports)#American and Canadian football|sudden-death quarter]], and regular season games can still end in a tie if neither team scores. Overtime for regular season games in the [[National Football League|NFL]] began with the [[1974 NFL Season|1974]] season. In the post-season, if the teams are still tied, teams will play additional overtime periods until either team scores.)
*[[Try (American Football)|Extra point tries]] are attempted from the three-yard line. The NFL uses the two-yard line. This counts as one point. Teams can also go for &quot;the [[two point conversion]]&quot; which is when a team will line up at the three yard line and try to score. If they are successful, they receive two points, if they are not, then they receive zero points. The two point conversion was not implemented in the NFL until 1994, but it had been previously used in the old American Football League (AFL) before it merged with the NFL in 1970.
*The defensive team may score two points on a point-after touchdown attempt by returning a blocked kick, fumble, or interception into the opposition's end zone. In addition, if the defensive team gains possession, but then moves backwards into the endzone and is stopped, a one point safety will be awarded to the offense, although, unlike a real safety, the offense kicks off, opposed to the team charged with the safety. This college rule was added in 1988. In the NFL, a conversion attempt ends when the defending team gains possession of the football.
*The [[two-minute warning]] is not used in college football, except in rare cases where the scoreboard clock has malfunctioned and is not being used.
*There is an option to use instant replay review of officiating decisions. Division I FBS (formerly Division I-A) schools use replay in virtually all games; replay is rarely used in lower division games. Every play is subject to booth review with coaches only having one challenge. In the NFL, challenges are only automatic in the final two minutes of each half.
*In the 2006 season, the game clock was started when the ball was declared ready for play after the defensive team (during a scrimmage down) or the kick-receiving team (during a free kick down) was awarded a first down (change of possession), reducing the time of games. This rule only lasted one year.
*In the 1984 season, the ball was placed on the 30 yard line (instead of the 20) if a kickoff sailed through the end zone on the fly and untouched. This rule was rescinded after one year.
*Among other rule changes to 2007, kickoffs have been moved from the 35 yard line back five yards to the 30 yard line to match that of the NFL. Some coaches and officials are questioning this rule change as it could lead to more injuries to the players as there will likely be more kickoff returns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Kickoffs from 30 yard line could create more returns, injuries | url=http://sports.yahoo.com/ncaaf/news?slug=ap-ncaa-rules&amp;prov=ap&amp;type=lgns | publisher=AP | date=April 16, 2007 | accessdate=2007-08-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rationale for the rule change was to help reduce dead time in the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=NCAA Football Rules Committee Votes To Restore Plays While Attempting To Maintain Shorter Overall Game Time | url=http://www2.ncaa.org/portal/media_and_events/press_room/2007/february/20070214_football_cmtee_rls.html | publisher=NCAA | date=2007-02-14 | accessdate=2007-08-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bowl games==
[[Image:2010 Bowls-USA-states.png|thumb|right|300px|Number of bowl games per state for the 2010-2011 season.]]
{{Main|Bowl game}}
Unlike most other sports—collegiate or professional—the [[Division I (NCAA)|Football Bowl Subdivision]], formerly known as Division I-A college football, does not employ a playoff system to determine a champion. Instead, it has a series of &quot;bowl games.&quot; The annual national champion is determined by a vote of sports writers and other non-players. This system has been challenged but little headway has been made given the entrenched vested economic interests in the various bowls.

A bowl game is a post-season college football game, typically in the [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I Bowl Subdivision]]. The first bowl game was the [[1902 Rose Bowl]], played between [[1902 Michigan Wolverines football team|Michigan]] and [[Stanford Cardinal football|Stanford]]; Michigan won 49-0. It ended when Stanford requested and Michigan agreed to end it with 8 minutes on the clock. That game was so lopsided that the game was not played annually until 1916, when the Tournament of Roses decided to reattempt the postseason game. The term &quot;bowl&quot; originates from the shape of the [[Rose Bowl (stadium)|Rose Bowl stadium]] in [[Pasadena, California]], which was built in 1923 and looked like a bowl. This is where the name came in to use, as it became known as the [[Rose Bowl Game]]. Other games came along and used the term &quot;bowl&quot;, whether the stadium was shaped like a bowl or not.

At the Division I FBS level, teams must earn the right to be [[bowl eligible]] by winning at least 6 games during the season. They are then invited to a bowl game based on their conference ranking and the tie-ins that the conference has to each bowl game. For the 2009 season, there were 34 bowl games, so 68 of the 120 Division I FBS teams were invited to play at a bowl. These games are played from mid-December to early January and most of the later bowl games are typically considered more prestigious.

After the Bowl Championship Series, additional all-star bowl games round out the post-season schedule through the beginning of February.

=== Bowl Championship Series (BCS) ===
{{Main|Bowl Championship Series}}
&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:Foxbcslogo.jpg|left|160px|Bowl Championship Series logo]] --&gt;
The NCAA created the Bowl Championship Series (BCS) in 1998 in order to create a definitive National Championship game for college football.  The series would include the four most prominent bowl games (Rose Bowl, Orange Bowl, Sugar Bowl, Fiesta Bowl), while the National Championship game would rotate each year between one of these venues.  If, for example, the Rose Bowl was to be played as the National Championship one year, the other three games of the series would still follow their normal procedures for picking teams, such as considering conference champions and at-large bids.  The ACC, Big 10, Big 12, Big East, Pac 10, and SEC Conference champions would all be guaranteed a spot in one of the BCS games, while the remaining spots would go to at-large teams.  The BCS selection committee uses a complicated, and often controversial, computer system to rank all Division 1-FBS teams and the top two teams at the end of the season play for the National Championship.  This computer system, which factors in newspaper polls, online polls, coaches’ polls, strength of schedule, and various other factors of a team’s season, has led to much dispute over whether the two best teams in the country are being selected to play in the National Championship game.  The BCS system was slightly adjusted in 2006, as the NCAA added a 5th game to the series, called the National Championship Game.  This would allow the four other BCS bowls to use their normal selection process to select the teams in their games while the top 2 teams in the BCS rankings would play in the new National Championship Game.

'''Ciprofloxacin''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]]) is a synthetic [[chemotherapeutic]] [[antibiotic]] of the [[fluoroquinolone]] drug class.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Nelson | first1 = JM. | last2 = Chiller | first2 = TM. | last3 = Powers | first3 = JH. | last4 = Angulo | first4 = FJ. | title = Fluoroquinolone-resistant Campylobacter species and the withdrawal of fluoroquinolones from use in poultry: a public health success story. | journal = Clin Infect Dis | volume = 44 | issue = 7 | pages = 977–80 | month = Apr | year = 2007 | doi = 10.1086/512369 | pmid = 17342653 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kawahara | first1 = S. | title = [Chemotherapeutic agents under study] | journal = Nippon Rinsho | volume = 56 | issue = 12 | pages = 3096–9 | month = Dec | year = 1998 | pmid = 9883617 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is a second-generation [[quinolone|fluoroquinolone]] antibacterial. It kills bacteria by interfering with the enzymes that cause DNA to rewind after being copied, which stops synthesis of DNA and of protein.

Ciprofloxacin is marketed worldwide with over three hundred different brand names. In the United States, Canada, and the UK, it is marketed as '''Baycip''', '''Ciloxan''', '''Ciflox''', '''Cipro''', '''Cipro XR''', '''Cipro XL''', '''Ciproxin''', '''Prociflor''', and most recently, '''Proquin'''. It is also marketed as '''Ciprex''' in India and Russia and &quot;Cetraxal&quot; in Spain. In addition, ciprofloxacin is available as a generic drug under a variety of different brand names and is also available for limited use in [[veterinary medicine]].

Ciprofloxacin was first patented in 1983 by [[Bayer|Bayer A.G.]] and subsequently approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) in 1987. Ciprofloxacin has 12 FDA-approved human uses and other veterinary uses, but it is often used for unapproved uses (off-label). Ciprofloxacin interacts with other drugs, herbal and natural supplements, and thyroid medications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Cooper JG, Harboe K, Frost SK, Skadberg Ø |title=Ciprofloxacin interacts with thyroid replacement therapy |journal=BMJ |volume=330 |issue=7498 |page=1002 |year=2005 |month=April |pmid=15860826 |pmc=557149 |doi=10.1136/bmj.330.7498.1002 |url= |first1=JG |first2=K |first3=SK |issn=0959-8138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2011 the FDA has added two [[black box warnings]] for this drug in reference to spontaneous tendon ruptures and the fact that ciprofloxacin may cause worsening of myasthenia gravis symptoms, including muscle weakness and breathing problems. Such an adverse reaction is a potentially life-threatening event and may require ventilatory support.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2011/019537s075,020780s033lbl.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical uses==
Ciprofloxacin is used to treat a number of infections including: infections of bones and joints, [[endocarditis]], [[gastroenteritis]], [[malignant otitis externa]], [[respiratory tract infections]], [[cellulitis]], [[urinary tract infections]], [[prostatitis]], [[anthrax]], [[chancroid]], among others.&lt;ref name=AHFS&gt;{{cite web|title=Ciprofloxacin-Hydrochloride|url=http://www.drugs.com/monograph/ciprofloxacin-hydrochloride.html|work=The American Society of Health-System Pharmacists|accessdate=3 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ciprofloxacin is not recommended to treat community acquired pneumonia (CAP) as a stand-alone first-line agent. The current guidelines (Infectious Diseases Society of America 2007) state, in very limited circumstances, ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin should be combined with other drugs such as a beta-lactam drug to treat specific CAP infections, but neither drug is recommended to be used separately as a stand-alone first-line agent. In addition, the current guidelines state: &quot;Data exist suggesting that resistance to macrolides and older fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin) results in clinical failure. Other studies have shown that repeated use of fluoroquinolones predicts an increased risk of infection with fluoroquinolone-resistant pneumococci....&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Mandell | first1 = LA. | last2 = Wunderink | first2 = RG. | last3 = Anzueto | first3 = A. | last4 = Bartlett | first4 = JG. | last5 = Campbell | first5 = GD. | last6 = Dean | first6 = NC. | last7 = Dowell | first7 = SF. | last8 = File | first8 = TM. | last9 = Musher | first9 = DM. | title = Infectious Diseases Society of America/American Thoracic Society consensus guidelines on the management of community-acquired pneumonia in adults. | journal = Clin Infect Dis | volume = 44 Suppl 2 | url = http://www.thoracic.org/sections/publications/statements/resources/idsaats-cap.pdf | format = PDF | pages = S27–72 | month = Mar | year = 2007 | doi = 10.1086/511159 | pmid = 17278083 }}{{dead link|date=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Note: Ciprofloxacin may be licensed for other uses, or restricted, by the various regulatory agencies worldwide.

===Availability===
Ciprofloxacin is available as tablets, intravenous solutions, eye and ear drops

==Contraindications==
As noted above, under licensed use, ciprofloxacin is also now considered to be contraindicated for the treatment of certain sexually transmitted diseases by some experts due to bacterial resistance.&lt;ref name=&quot;nycms.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author=Susan Blank |coauthors=Julia Schillinger |title=DOHMH ALERT #8:Fluoroquinolone-resistant gonorrhea, NYC |url=http://www.nycms.org/article_view.php3?view=947&amp;part=1 |publisher=New York County Medical Society |location=USA |date=14 May 2004 |accessdate=22 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are only four contraindications found within the 2009 package insert:&lt;ref name=&quot;accessdata.fda.gov&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Cipro Labeling Revision 02/25/2011 Supplement 075 |url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2011/019537s075,020780s033lbl.pdf |publisher=[[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) |date=2011-02-25 |accessdate=1 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*&quot;Coadministration of ciprofloxacin with other drugs primarily metabolized by [[CYP1A2]] results in increased plasma concentrations of these drugs and could lead to clinically significant adverse events of the coadministered drug.&quot;

*&quot;Concomitant administration with [[tizanidine]] is contraindicated.&quot;

*&quot;Ciprofloxacin is contraindicated in persons with a history of hypersensitivity to ciprofloxacin, any member of the quinolone class of antimicrobial agents, or any of the product components.&quot;

*&quot;Local I.V. site reactions are more frequent if the infusion time is 30 minutes or less. These may appear as local skin reactions that resolve rapidly upon completion of the infusion. Subsequent intravenous administration is not contraindicated unless the reactions recur or worsen.&quot;

Due to growing prevalence of antibiotic resistance to the fluoroquinolones in southeast Asia, the use of ciprofloxacin in patients having been to southeast Asia is increasingly being discouraged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Fluoroquinolone resistance in Neisseria gonorrhoeae—Colorado and Washington, 1995 |journal=MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. |volume=44 |issue=41 |pages=761–4 |year=1995 |month=October |pmid=7565558 |url=http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00039305.htm |issn=0149-2195 |author1=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ciprofloxacin is also considered to be contraindicated within the pediatric population (except for the indications outlined under licensed use above), [[pregnancy]], nursing mothers, and in patients with [[epilepsy]] or other seizure disorders.

*'''Pregnancy'''
The fluoroquinolones rapidly cross the blood-placenta and blood-milk barriers, and are extensively distributed into the fetal tissues. For this reason, the fluoroquinolones are contraindicated during pregnancy due to the risk of spontaneous abortions and birth defects. The fluoroquinolones have also been reported as being present in the mother's milk and are passed on to the nursing child, which may increases the risk of the child suffering from this syndrome as well, even though the child had never been prescribed or taken any of the drugs found within this class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Shin HC, Kim JC, Chung MK |title=Fetal and maternal tissue distribution of the new fluoroquinolone DW-116 in pregnant rats |journal=Comp.

*'''Pediatric population'''
Fluoroquinolones are not licensed by the U.S. FDA for use in children due to the risk of fatalities&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid1592498&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Karande SC, Kshirsagar NA |title=Adverse drug reaction monitoring of ciprofloxacin in pediatric practice |journal=Indian Pediatr |volume=29 |issue=2 |pages=181–8 |year=1992 |month=February |pmid=1592498 |first1=SC |first2=NA |issn=0019-6061 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as permanent injury to the musculoskeletal system, with two exceptions. Ciprofloxacin is being licensed for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections and pyelonephritis due to ''Escherichia coli'', and inhalational anthrax (postexposure), and levofloxacin was recently licensed for the treatment of inhalational anthrax (postexposure). However, the fluoroquinolones are licensed to treat lower respiratory infections in children with cystic fibrosis in the UK.

Within the studies submitted in response to a Pediatric Written Request (ciprofloxacin, circa 2004), the rate of atrophy was reported to be 9.3%.&lt;ref name=dospaidos&gt;{{cite web |author=Joette Meyer |coauthors=Renata Albrecht |title=Division of Special Pathogen and Immunologic Drug Products Summary of Clinical Review of Studies Submitted in Response to a Pediatric Written Request |url=http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/AC/05/briefing/2005-4152b1_03_03_Cipro%20medical.pdf |publisher=[[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) |date=16 March 2004 |accessdate=22 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Within the BPCA Pediatric Studies Summary for ciprofloxacin,&lt;ref name=dospaidos/&gt; it was stated that the overall incidence of adverse events at six weeks was 41%. This would be consistent with the safety profile found with the other fluoroquinolones studied in the pediatric population. As such, the current ban on the use of the fluoroquinolones in the pediatric population is both reasonable and supported by various clinical studies. The most recent long term study, ''BAY 0 9867 Cipro Pediatric Use Study (QUIP)'', which followed pediatric patients from 1999–2008,&lt;ref&gt;[http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/results/NCT00761462?show_out=all#all BAY 0 9867 Cipro Pediatric Use Study (QUIP) - Study Results - ClinicalTrials.gov&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; supports the current expert opinion that the risk of permanent injury continues to outweigh the potential benefits of ciprofloxacin therapy in the pediatric population.

Within the United States, the FDA has stated it is their intention to pursue the licensing of the fluoroquinolones for pediatric use in spite of the evidence presented at that 62 Meeting of the Anti-Infective Drugs Advisory Committee that the fluoroquinolones cause irreversible joint damage in the pediatric population.&lt;ref&gt;62 Meeting of the Anti-Infective Drugs Advisory Committee [http://fqresearch.org/pdf_files/62nd_fda_meeting.pdf FQresearch.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Special precautions==
The status of the patient's renal function and hepatic function must also be taken into consideration to avoid an accumulation that may lead to an overdose and the development of toxicity. Ciprofloxacin is eliminated primarily by renal excretion. However, the drug is also metabolized and partially cleared through the liver and the intestines. Modification of the dosage is ''recommended'' using the table found within the package insert for those with impaired liver or kidney function. However, since the drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidneys, the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. The duration of treatment depends upon the severity of infection and is usually 7 to 14 days.&lt;ref name=ctcos/&gt;

==Adverse effects==
{{See also|Adverse effects of fluoroquinolones}}
Serious adverse events occur more commonly with fluoroquinolones than with any other antibiotic drug classes. In most, adverse reactions are mild to moderate; however, occasionally serious adverse effects occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=15942881 |year=2005 |month=July |last1=Owens Rc |first1=Jr |last2=Ambrose |first2=PG |title=Antimicrobial safety: focus on fluoroquinolones. |volume=41 Suppl 2 |pages=S144–57 |issn=1058-4838 |doi=10.1086/428055 |journal=Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America |author2=Ambrose }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid11172695&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=De Sarro A, De Sarro G |title=Adverse reactions to fluoroquinolones. an overview on mechanistic aspects |journal=Curr.

Subsequent to this, on 25 June 2007, the U.S. FDA required manufacturers to add an additional warning to the package inserts that stated &quot;Other serious and sometimes fatal events, some due to hypersensitivity, and some due to uncertain etiology, have been reported in patients receiving therapy with quinolones, including ciprofloxacin.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Renata Albrecht |title=Cipro Labeling Revision Letter 06/19/2006 Supplement 062 |url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/appletter/2006/019537s62,020780s23,019847s37,019857s42,021473s16LTR.pdf |publisher=[[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) |date=19 June 2006 |accessdate=5 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until 2008, (four years later) that the label revisions for ciprofloxacin included any warnings concerning heart problems (prolonged QT interval / [[torsade de pointes]]).

This has led to a class action lawsuit by people harmed by the use of fluoroquinolones, as well as legal action by the consumer advocate group [[Public Citizen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Public Citizen Warns of Cipro Dangers |url=http://www.consumeraffairs.com/news04/2006/08/pubcit_cipro.html |publisher=Consumer affairs |location=USA |date=30 August 2006 |accessdate=7 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Partly as a result of the efforts of the State of Illinois and Public Citizen, the FDA ordered black box warnings on all fluoroquinolones advising consumers of the possible toxic effects of fluoroquinolones on tendons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/HEALTH/07/08/antibiotics.risk/index.html|title=FDA orders 'black box' label on some antibiotics |accessdate=2008-07-08 | work=CNN | date=8 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interactions==
The toxicity of drugs that are metabolised by the [[cytochrome P450]] system is enhanced by concomitant use of some quinolones. Coadministration may dangerously increase coumarin ([[warfarin]]) activity; INR should be monitored closely. They may also interact with the [[GABA A receptor]] and cause neurological symptoms; this effect is augmented by certain [[nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Brouwers JR |title=Drug interactions with quinolone antibacterials |journal=Drug Saf |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=268–81 |year=1992 |pmid=1524699 |doi=10.2165/00002018-199207040-00003 |month=July |first1=JR |issn=0114-5916 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Quercetin]], a flavonol, occasionally used as a [[dietary supplement]], may interact with fluoroquinolones, as quercetin competitively binds to bacterial DNA gyrase.

On 9 November 2005, the U.S. FDA required manufacturers to provide additional warnings within the package inserts concerning ciprofloxacin being an inhibitor of human cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) mediated metabolism. The new warning stated: &lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Coadministration of ciprofloxacin with other drugs primarily metabolized by CYP1A2 results in increased plasma concentrations of these drugs and could lead to clinically significant adverse events of the coadministered drug.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Renata Albrecht |title=Cipro Labeling Revision letter 11/09/2005 Supplement 060 |url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/appletter/2005/019537s60,019847s36,019857s41,020780s20,021473s13ltr.pdf |publisher=[[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) |date=2005-11-09 |accessdate=2009-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Concurrent administration of ciprofloxacin with magnesium or aluminum antacids, sucralfate or products containing calcium, iron, or zinc (including multivitamins or other dietary supplements) may substantially decrease the absorption of ciprofloxacin, resulting in serum and urine levels considerably lower than desired.&lt;ref name=&quot;FDA 81532304, R.1&quot;/&gt;

===Significant drug interactions===
Ciprofloxacin can alter and be altered by the metabolism and effects of other drugs, resulting in some significant drug-drug interactions that may affect the [[musculoskeletal]], [[central nervous system|central nervous]], [[renal]], and other systems.

Current or past treatment with oral [[corticosteroids]] is associated with an increased risk of [[achilles tendon]] rupture, especially in elderly patients who are also taking the [[fluoroquinolones]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=van der Linden PD, Sturkenboom MC, Herings RM, Leufkens HM, Rowlands S, Stricker BH |title=Increased risk of achilles tendon rupture with quinolone antibacterial use, especially in elderly patients taking oral corticosteroids |journal=Arch.

Med. |volume=163 |issue=15 |pages=1801–7 |year=2003 |pmid=12912715 |doi=10.1001/archinte.163.15.1801 |url=http://archinte.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/163/15/1801 |month=August |first1=PD |first2=MC |first3=RM |first4=HM |first5=S |first6=BH |issn=0003-9926}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the subject of [[Black box warning]]s in FDA and [[BNF]] labeling for quinolones.

The [[Committee on the Safety of Medicines]] and the FDA warn that [[central nervous system]] adverse effects, including seizure risk, may be increased when NSAIDs are combined with quinolones.&lt;ref name=ctcos/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[British National Formulary]] (BNF 57) |author=Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain |authorlink=Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain |publisher=BMJ Group and RPS Publishing |chapter=5 Infections |year=2009 |isbn=9780853698456 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The interaction between quinolones and NSAIDs is important, because it has the potential for considerable CNS toxicity. The mechanism for this interaction is believed to be due to a [[synergistic]] increased antagonism of GABA neurotransmission.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid11172695&quot;/&gt;

Ciprofloxacin's renal clearance may affect other drugs subject to renal clearance or otherwise affecting the kidney. The use of ciprofloxacin concomitantly with [[cyclosporine]] has also been associated with transient elevations in serum [[creatinine]]. Renal tubular transport of [[methotrexate]] may be inhibited by concomitant administration of ciprofloxacin, potentially leading to increased plasma levels of methotrexate and risk of methotrexate toxicity. [[Probenecid]] interferes with renal tubular secretion of ciprofloxacin and produces an increase in the level of ciprofloxacin in serum.&lt;ref name=ctcos/&gt;

Some quinolones, including ciprofloxacin, exert an inhibitory effect on the cytochrome P-450 enzyme CYP1A2, thereby reducing clearance, and thus increasing blood levels of [[tizanidine]] and [[methylxanthines]] (for example,, [[theophylline]] and [[caffeine]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Harder S, Fuhr U, Staib AH, Wolff T |title=Ciprofloxacin-caffeine: a drug interaction established using in vivo and in vitro investigations |journal=Am.

Ciprofloxacin can reduce effects of other drugs; for example, it has been shown to interact with thyroid medications ([[levothyroxine]]), resulting in unexplained [[hypothyroidism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Cooper JG, Harboe K, Frost SK, Skadberg Ø |title=Ciprofloxacin interacts with thyroid replacement therapy |journal=BMJ |volume=330 |issue=7498 |page=1002 |month=April |date=2005-04 |pmid=15860826 |pmc=557149 |doi=10.1136/bmj.330.7498.1002 |url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/330/7498/1002 |first1=JG |first2=K |first3=SK |issn=0959-8138}}&lt;/ref&gt; Altered serum levels of [[phenytoin]] (increased and decreased) have been reported in patients receiving concomitant ciprofloxacin.&lt;ref name=ctcos/&gt;

==Overdose==
Overdose of ciprofloxacin may result in reversible renal toxicity. Treatment of overdose includes emptying of the stomach via induced vomiting or by [[gastric lavage]]. Careful monitoring and supportive treatment, monitoring of renal function and maintaining adequate hydration is recommended by the manufacturer. Administration of magnesium, aluminum, or calcium containing antacids can reduce the absorption of ciprofloxacin. [[Hemodialysis]] or [[peritoneal dialysis]] removes only less than 10 percent of ciprofloxacin.&lt;ref name=&quot;FDA 81532304, R.1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Cipro Labeling Revision 04/06/2009 Supplement 073 |url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2009/019537s073,020780s030lbl.pdf |publisher=[[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) |date=2009-04-06 |accessdate=8 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ciprofloxacin may be quantitated in plasma or serum to monitor for drug accumulation in patients with hepatic dysfunction or to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in acute overdose victims.&lt;ref&gt;R.

==Mechanism of action==
Ciprofloxacin is a [[broad-spectrum antibiotic]] active against both [[Gram-positive]] and [[Gram-negative]] bacteria. It functions by inhibiting [[DNA gyrase]], a type II [[topoisomerase]], and topoisomerase IV,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Drlica K, Zhao X |title=DNA gyrase, topoisomerase IV, and the 4-quinolones |journal=Microbiol Mol Biol Rev. |volume=61 |issue=3 |pages=377–92 |pmid=9293187 |pmc=232616 |url=http://mmbr.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=9293187 |date= September 1, 1997 |first1=K |first2=X |issn=1092-2172}}&lt;/ref&gt; enzymes necessary to separate bacterial DNA, thereby inhibiting cell division.

This mechanism can also affect mammalian cell replication. In particular, some congeners of this drug family (for example those that contain the C-8 fluorine)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Robinson MJ, Martin BA, Gootz TD, McGuirk PR, Osheroff N |title=Effects of novel fluoroquinolones on the catalytic activities of eukaryotic topoisomerase II: Influence of the C-8 fluorine group |journal=Antimicrob.

Although quinolones are highly toxic to mammalian cells in culture, its mechanism of cytotoxic action is not known.

==History==
[[Image:Cipro 250 mg.JPG|thumb|Ciprofloxacin 250mg tablets from Ukraine]]
The patent history for ciprofloxacin makes reference to a 1982 European Patent (patent number 0049355), as well a German patent dated 21 January 1986. Bayer introduced ciprofloxacin in 1987 and it was later approved by the U.S. FDA on 22 October 1987 for use in the United States to treat specific bacterial infections. In 1991, the intravenous formulation was introduced. The current United States patent appears to be held by Bayer, being the assignee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Streuff, ''et al.'' |title=United States Patent 5,286,754 |url=http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?u=%2Fnetahtml%2Fsrchnum.htm&amp;Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;r=1&amp;l=50&amp;f=G&amp;d=PALL&amp;s1=5286754.PN.&amp;OS=PN/5286754&amp;RS=PN/5286754 |publisher=uspto.gov |location=USA |date=15 February 1994 |accessdate=30 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States patent was applied for in January 1987, but was not approved until 1996 according to the patent history.

In 1999, Bayer's gross sales of Cipro in the United States were approximately $1.04 billion.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Cipro |url=http://www.prescriptionaccess.org/lawsuitssettlements/past_lawsuits?id=0010 |publisher=Prescription Access |location=USA |accessdate=4 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sale of ciprofloxacin increased dramatically following the [[anthrax]] scare of 2001. On 24 October 2002, the Bush Administration (2001–2009) announced a deal between the government and Bayer Pharmaceuticals to purchase 100 million tablets of ciprofloxacin at a reduced price of $0.95 per pill. A full course of ciprofloxacin for postexposure prophylaxis (60 days) resulting from this arrangement costs the government $204 per person treated, compared with $12 per person treated with [[doxycycline]], the drug normally used to treat anthrax, a difference of $192.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Bayer Corporation |authorlink=Bayer |title=HHS, Bayer Agree to Cipro Purchase |url=http://www.hhs.gov/news/press/2001pres/20011024.html |publisher=U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services |location=USA |date=24 October 2001 |accessdate=4 September 2009}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Generic equivalents===

On 24 October 2001, The Prescription Access Litigation (PAL), filed suit to dissolve an agreement between Bayer and three of its competitors which produced [[Generic drugs|generic versions of drugs]] ([[Barr Pharmaceuticals|Barr Laboratories]], [[Watson Pharmaceuticals|Rugby Laboratories]], and [[Marion Merrell Dow|Hoechst-Marion-Roussel]]) that it claimed was blocking access to adequate supplies and cheaper, generic versions of ciprofloxacin. The plaintiffs charged that Bayer Corporation, a unit of Bayer AG, had unlawfully paid the three competing companies a total of $200 million to prevent cheaper, generic versions of ciprofloxacin from being brought to the market, as well as manipulating the price and supply of ciprofloxacin. Numerous other consumer advocacy groups joined the lawsuit. On 15 October 2008, five years after Bayer's patent had expired, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York granted Bayer's and the other defendants' motion for summary judgment, holding that any anticompetitive effects caused by the settlement agreements between Bayer and its codefendants were within the exclusionary zone of the patent and thus could not be redressed by federal antitrust law,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit |title=United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit |url=http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/opinions/08-1097.pdf |location=USA |format=PDF |year=2008 |accessdate=4 September 2009}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; in effect upholding Bayer's agreement with its competitors.

Musculoskeletal disorders attributed to use of quinolone antibiotics were first reported in the medical literature in 1972, as an adverse reaction to [[nalidixic acid]].&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated604&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bailey RR, Natale R, Linton AL |title=Nalidixic acid arthralgia |journal=Can Med Assoc J |volume=107 |issue=7 |pages=604 passim |year=1972 |month=October |pmid=4541768 |pmc=1940945 |first1=RR |first2=R |first3=AL |issn=0008-4409}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rheumatic disease after use of a fluoroquinolone ([[norfloxacin]]) was first reported 11 years later.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated590&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bailey RR, Kirk JA, Peddie BA |title=Norfloxacin-induced rheumatic disease |journal=N Z Med J |volume=96 |issue=736 |page=590 |year=1983 |month=July |pmid=6223241 |first1=RR |first2=JA |first3=BA |issn=0028-8446 |url= |format=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to a 1995 letter published in the ''[[New England Journal of Medicine]]'', representatives of the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) stated that the agency would &quot;update the labeling [package insert] for all marketed fluoroquinolones to include a warning about the possibility of tendon rupture.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated193&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Szarfman A, Chen M, Blum MD |title=More on fluoroquinolone antibiotics and tendon rupture |journal=N Engl J Med |volume=332 |issue=3 |page=193 |year=1995 |month=January |pmid=7800023 |format=letter |doi=10.1056/NEJM199501193320319 |first1=A |first2=M |first3=MD |issn=0028-4793}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By August 1996, the FDA had not taken action, and the consumer advocacy group [[Public Citizen]] filed a petition with the FDA prompting the agency to act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Petition to Require a Warning on All Fluoroquinolone Antibiotics (HRG Publication #1399) |date=August 1, 1996 |publisher=[[Public Citizen]] |url=http://www.citizen.org/publications/release.cfm?ID=6595}} Retrieved on December 27, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Two months later, the FDA published an alert in the ''FDA Medical Bulletin'' and requested that fluoroquinolone package inserts be amended to include information on this risk.&lt;ref name=FDA1996&gt;{{cite journal |title=Reports of adverse events with fluoroquinolones |journal=FDA Medical Bulletin |month=October | year=1996 |volume=26 |issue=3 |url=http://www.fqresearch.org/text_documents/FDA_Medical_Bulletin_1996.doc |format=Doc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

additional Black Box warning was added to all the drugs within this class, including ciprofloxacin, stating that the fluoroquinolone class may cause worsening of myasthenia gravis symptoms, including muscle weakness and breathing problems. Such an adverse reaction is a potentially life-threatening event and may require ventilatory support.

Review of the FDA website indicates that the majority of the generic versions of the fluoroquinolones have ''not'' been updated to include this Black Box Warning as of September 2009. Additionally there are numerous reports that this information has not been dessiminated to the pharmacist, the name brand products continue to contain the previous labels that are absent of this warning, and the Medication Guide has not been made available to the pharmicist or physician for distribution.

===FDA warning letters===
Additionally the manufacturers of ciprofloxacin (Bayer A.G.) received numerous warning letters from the United States [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|Food and Drug Administration]] regarding false advertising and failure to provide adequate warnings within their promotional materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=NDA #19-537 Cipro (ciprofloxacin) Tablets Macmis ID #7451 |accessdate=30 January 2009 |date=2 April 1999 |publisher=[[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA)|url=http://www.fqresearch.org/pdf_files/040299_bayer.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=RE: Cipro HC Otic Suspension (Ciprofloxacin Hydrochloride and Hydrocortisone Otic Suspension) NDA 20-805 Ciloxan (ciprofloxacin ophthalmic) Solution NDA 19-992 MACMIS ID# 11015 |date=18 July 2003 |accessdate=30 January 2009 |publisher=[[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) |url=http://www.fqresearch.org/pdf_files/11015.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Litigation==
'''Bayer AG'''
A class action was filed against Bayer AG on behalf of employees of the Brentwood Post Office in Washington, D.C., and workers at the U.S. Capitol, along with employees of American Media, Inc. in Florida and postal workers in general who alleged that they suffered serious adverse effects from taking the antibiotic ciprofloxacin (Cipro) in the aftermath of the anthrax attacks in 2001. The adverse effects included; tendon rupture, seizures, intestinal problems, tendonitis, anxiety, insomnia, muscle aches, depression and meniscus tears. The action alleged that Bayer failed to warn class members of the potential side effects of the drug, thereby violating the Pennsylvania Unfair Trade Practices and Consumer Protection Laws. According to the allegations within the complaint, exposed individuals were not informed of the true safety profile of ciprofloxacin, the high rate of adverse events associated with its use, or the availability of safer and equally effective alternative drugs. The complaint further alleged that, as a result of taking Cipro, many individuals suffered severe and debilitating injuries. The action sought funding for a medical monitoring program and compensatory damages for those workers who have suffered side effects. In 2004, the law firm of Goodell, DeVries, Leech &amp; Dann, LLP were retained as national counsel in this litigation. The class action was defeated and the litigation abandoned by the plaintiffs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Anthrax Scare Leaves Trail of Cipro Victims - Class Actions filed in Two States |url=http://www.sheller.com/NewsDetails.asp?NewsID=72 |publisher=Sheller Ludwig &amp; Sheller |location=USA |date=17 October 2003 |accessdate=9 September 2009}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Legal Brief of Postal Employees Cases (EEOC, MSPB, District Courts) |url=http://www.lunewsviews.com/legal_briefs_archives.htm#cipro |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071021073109/http://www.lunewsviews.com/legal_briefs_archives.htm#cipro |archivedate=2007-10-21 |publisher=Postal Reporter |location=USA |accessdate=9 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Charles P.

{{Communion}}
'''Consubstantiation''' is a theological doctrine that (like [[transubstantiation]]) attempts to describe the nature of the [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Eucharist]] in concrete [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] terms. It holds that during the [[sacrament]], the fundamental &quot;''[[Substance theory|substance]]''&quot; of the body and blood of [[Christ]] are present ''alongside'' the substance of the bread and wine, which remain present. The doctrine of consubstantiation is often held in contrast to the doctrine of [[transubstantiation]].

The doctrine of consubstantiation is erroneously identified as the eucharistic doctrine of [[Martin Luther]],&lt;ref&gt;F.L. Cross, ed., ''The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church'', second edition, (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1974), 340 ''sub loco''.&lt;/ref&gt; who defined his doctrine as the [[sacramental union]].&lt;ref&gt;''Weimar Ausgabe'' 26, 442; ''Luther's Works'' 37, 299-300.&lt;/ref&gt; While some Lutherans believe in consubstantiation, others reject the concept because it substitutes what they believe to be the biblical doctrine with a philosophical construct and implies, in their view, a natural, local inclusion of the body and blood of Christ in the consecrated bread and wine of the eucharist.&lt;ref&gt;J.T. Mueller, &lt;cite&gt;''hristian Dogmatics: A Handbook of Doctrinal Theology''&lt;/cite&gt;, (St. Louis: CPH, 1934), 519; cf. also Erwin L. Lueker, &lt;cite&gt;''Christian Cyclopedia''&lt;/cite&gt;, (St. Louis: CPH, 1975), under the entry &quot;consubstantiation.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and culture==
In [[England]] in the late 14th century, there was a political and religious movement known as [[Lollardy]]. Among much broader goals, the Lollards affirmed a form of consubstantiation—that the Eucharist remained physically bread and wine, while becoming spiritually the body and blood of Christ. Lollardy survived up until the time of the [[English Reformation]].

In literature the conflict between consubstantiation and transubstantiation was satirically described in [[Jonathan Swift]]'s ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'' as war between [[Lilliput and Blefuscu]].{{Fact|date=June 2008}}

'''Chlorophyta''' is a division of [[green algae]], informally called '''chlorophytes'''. The name is used in two very different senses so that care is needed to determine the use by a particular author. In older classification systems, it refers to a highly [[Paraphyly|paraphyletic]] group of ''all'' the green algae within the green plants ([[Viridiplantae]]), and thus includes about 7,000 [[species]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Hoek, Mann and Jahns 95&quot;&gt;'''Hoek, C. van den, Mann, D.G. and Jahns, H.M.''' 1995.

Like the [[land plants]] ([[bryophyte]]s and [[Tracheophyta|tracheophytes]]), green algae contain [[chlorophylls]] ''a'' and ''b'', and store food as [[starch]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Hoek, Mann and Jahns 95&quot;/&gt; in their [[plastids]].

In newer classifications, it refers to one of the two [[clades]] making up the Viridiplantae, which are the chlorophytes and the streptophytes or charophytes.&lt;ref name=&quot;LewisMcCourt2004&quot;&gt;{{Citation |last=Lewis |first=Louise A. |last2=McCourt |first2=R.M. |year=2004 |title=Green algae and the origin of land plants |journal=Am.

&lt;!-- This material needs to be checked to determine whether it is true of both senses of Chlorophyta or only one of them, and if the latter, which one.

The division contains both unicellular and multicellular species. While most species live in [[freshwater biology|freshwater habitats]] and a large number in [[marine biology|marine habitats]], other species are adapted to a wide range of environments. [[Watermelon snow]], or ''Chlamydomonas nivalis'', of the class Chlorophyceae, lives on summer alpine snowfields. Others live attached to rocks or woody parts of trees. Some [[lichen]]s are symbiotic relationships between fungi and green algae.

Members of the Chlorophyta also form symbiotic relationships with [[protozoa]], sponges and cnidarians. All are flagellated&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17272304&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kapraun DF |title=Nuclear DNA content estimates in green algal lineages: chlorophyta and streptophyta |journal=Ann.

Some conduct sexual reproduction, which is oogamous or isogamous.

==Fossil record and other species==
[[Image:Protohydrochoerus.jpg|thumb|left|Life restoration of the extinct ''Protohydrochoerus'']] A larger capybara called ''[[Neochoerus pinckneyi]]'' once existed in [[North America]], having invaded that continent during the [[Great American Interchange]] that followed formation of the [[Isthmus of Panama]].  Other fossil [[caviomorph]]s that were eight times the size of modern capybaras have been  called &quot;capybaras&quot; by the popular press, but were actually [[Dinomyidae|dinomyid]]s related to the [[pacarana]].&lt;ref name=&quot;rebsig-questionable-resource&quot;/&gt;
There is also an [[extant taxon|extant]] &quot;[[lesser capybara]]&quot;, ''Hydrochoerus isthmius'', with a disjoint range
in [[Colombia]], [[Venezuela]] and [[Panama]].&lt;ref name=&quot;UMichigan&quot;/&gt;

==Ecology==
[[Image:2007 02 Capybaras 05.jpg|thumb|left|A group of capybaras at [[Hato La Fe]] in the [[Los Llanos]] region of [[Venezuela]]]] 
Capybara are semi-aquatic mammals&lt;ref name=&quot;Palm Beach Zoo&quot;/&gt; found wild in much of South America (including Colombia, [[Ecuador]], [[Bolivia]], Venezuela, Brazil, [[Argentina]], [[Guyana]], [[Suriname]], [[French Guiana]], [[Uruguay]], [[Peru]], and [[Paraguay]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Bristol&quot;/&gt;) in densely [[forest]]ed areas near bodies of water, such as lakes, rivers, swamps, ponds and marshes,&lt;ref name=&quot;Smithsonian&quot;/&gt; as well as flooded [[savannah]] and along rivers in [[tropical forest]]. They roam in home [[range (biology)|range]]s of 25–50&amp;nbsp;[[acre]]s (10–20&amp;nbsp;ha).&lt;ref name=&quot;rebsig-questionable-resource&quot;/&gt;

Many escapees from captivity can also be found in similar watery habitats around the world. Sightings are fairly common in [[Florida]], although a breeding population has not yet been confirmed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://myfwc.com/wildlifehabitats/Nonnative_Capybara.htm  Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission: Capybara - ''Hydrochaeris hydrochaeris'']&lt;/ref&gt;  Though it has been erroneously stated that a population of capybara existed in the River [[Arno]] in [[Florence]], Italy, this was determined to be the nutria or [[coypu]] (''Myocastor coypus''), a considerably smaller South American aquatic rodent with a similar appearance.

===Diet and predation===
Capybaras are [[herbivore]]s, grazing mainly on grasses and [[aquatic plants]],&lt;ref name=&quot;RevBiolTrop&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Smithsonian&quot;/&gt; as well as [[fruit]] and tree bark.&lt;ref name=&quot;Palm Beach Zoo&quot;/&gt; An adult capybara will eat 6&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;8&amp;nbsp;pounds (2.7&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;3.6&amp;nbsp;kg) of grasses per day.&lt;ref name=&quot;rebsig-questionable-resource&quot;/&gt; Capybara are very selective feeders with four to six plant species making 75% of its diet.&lt;ref name= &quot;Quintana 1998&quot;&gt;Quintana, R. D., S. Monge, et al. (1998). &quot;Feeding patterns of capybara Hydrochaeris hypdrochaeris (Rodentia, Hydrochaeridae) and cattle in the non-insular area of the Lower Delta of the Parana River, Argentina.&quot; Mammalia 62(1): 37-52.&lt;/ref&gt; They will select the leaves of one species and disregard other species surrounding it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barreto 1998&quot;&gt;Barreto, G. R. and E. Herrera (1998). &quot;Foraging patterns of capybaras in a seasonally flooded savanna of venezuela.&quot; Journal of Tropical Ecology 14(1): 87-98.&lt;/ref&gt; Capybaras eat an even greater variety of plants during the dry season as there are fewer plants available. While they eat grass during the wet season, they have to switch to reeds during the dry season as they are more abundant.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barreto 1998&quot;/&gt; Plants that capybaras eat during the summer lose their nutritional value in the winter and the thus not consumed at that time.&lt;ref name= &quot;Quintana 1998&quot;/&gt; The capybara's jaw hinge is non-perpendicular and they thus chew food by grinding back and forth rather than side-to-side.&lt;ref name=&quot;SFZoo&quot;/&gt; Capybaras are [[coprophagous]], meaning they eat their own [[feces]] as a source of bacterial [[gut flora]] and to help [[digestion|digest]] the [[cellulose]] in the grass that forms their normal diet and extract the maximum protein from their food. They may also regurgitate food to masticate again, similar to cud-chewing by a cow.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lord-Rexford 1994&quot;/&gt;

Like its cousin the [[guinea pig]], the capybara does not have the capacity to synthesize [[vitamin C]], and capybaras unsupplemented with vitamin C in captivity have been reported to develop gum disease as a sign of [[scurvy]]. &lt;ref&gt;PMID 10682750&lt;/ref&gt;

Capybaras are very gregarious. While they do sometimes live solitarily they are more commonly found in groups that average 10-20 individuals. With 2-4 of them being adult males, 4-7 being adult females and the rest being juveniles.&lt;ref name= &quot;Alho 1987&quot;&gt;Alho, C. J. R. and N. L. Rondon (1987). &quot;Habitats, population densities, and social structure of capybaras (hydrochaeris hypdrochaeris rodentia) in the pantanal Brazil.&quot; ''Revista Brasileira de Zoologia'' 4(2): 139-149.&lt;/ref&gt; Capybara groups can consist of as many as 50 or 100 individuals during the dry season,&lt;ref name=&quot;Lord-Rexford 1994&quot;&gt;Lord-Rexford, D. (1994). &quot;A descriptive account of capybara behaviour.&quot; ''Studies on neotropical fauna and environment''. 29(1): 11-22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= &quot;Macdonald 1981&quot;&gt;Macdonald, D. W. (1981). &quot;Dwindling resources and the social behavior of Capybaras, (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris) (Mammalia).&quot; ''Journal of Zoology'' 194: 371-391.&lt;/ref&gt; when the animals gather around available water sources. Males are organized in stable, linear hierarchies. The dominant male in each group is significantly heavier than any of the subordinates, but among subordinates, status is not correlated with weight.&lt;ref name= &quot;Herrera 1993&quot;&gt;Herrera, E. and D. W. Macdonald (1993). &quot;Aggression, dominance, and mating success among capybara males (Hydrochaeris hypdrochaeris).&quot; ''Behavioral Ecology'' 4(2): 114-119.&lt;/ref&gt; The dominant male is positioned in the center of the group while subordinates are on the periphery. These hierarchies are established early in life among the young with play fights and mock copulations.&lt;ref name= &quot;Alho 1987&quot;/&gt; The most dominant males have access to the best resources.&lt;ref name= &quot;Herrera 1993&quot;/&gt; Capybaras are very vocal and, when in groups, chatter with each other to establish social bonds, dominance or general group census.&lt;ref name= &quot;Macdonald 1981&quot;/&gt; They can make a dog-like bark which is made when the animals are threatened or when females are herding young.&lt;ref name=&quot;Murphey 1985&quot;&gt;Murphey, R. M., J. S. Mariano, et al. (1985). &quot;Behavioral observations in a capybara colony (Hydrochaeris hypdrochaeris).&quot; ''Applied Animal Behaviour Science'' 14: 89-98.&lt;/ref&gt; The bark of a capybara is often mistaken for that of a dog.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lord-Rexford 1994&quot;/&gt;

Capybara have two different scent glands; a morillo, located on the snout, and an anal gland. Both sexes have those glands but males have larger morillos and their anal pockets can open more easily. The anal glands of males are also lined with detachable hairs. A crystalline form of scent secretion is coated on these hairs and are release when in contact with objects like plants. These hairs have a longer lasting scent mark and are tasted by other capybaras.&lt;ref name= &quot;Macdonald 1984&quot;&gt;Macdonald, D. W., K. Krantz, et al. (1984). &quot;Behavioral anatomical and chemical aspects of scent marking among capybaras Hydrochaeris-hypdrochaeris rodentia caviomorpha.&quot; ''Journal of Zoology'' 202(3): 341-360.&lt;/ref&gt; A capybaras marks by rubbing its morillo on an object or by walking over a scrub and marking with its anal gland. A cabypara can spread its scent further by urinating.&lt;ref name= &quot;Macdonald 1984&quot;/&gt; However females usually mark without urinating and mark less frequently than males overall. Females mark more often during the wet season when they are in [[estrus]]. In addition to objects, males will also mark females. &lt;ref name= &quot;Macdonald 1984&quot;/&gt;

[[Image:capibara_apenheul.jpg|thumb|right|Two capybaras in captivity in [[Apenheul_Primate_Park|Apenheul]] zoo]]
===Reproduction===
When in estrus, the female's scent changes subtly and nearby males begin pursuit.&lt;ref name= &quot;Herrera 1993&quot;/&gt; In addition, a female will alert males that she is in estrus by emitting a whistling noise though her nostrils.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lord-Rexford 1994&quot;/&gt; During mating, the female has the advantage and mating choice. Capybaras mate only in the water and if a female does not want to mate with a certain male she will either submerge or leave the water. &lt;ref name=&quot;Lord-Rexford 1994&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name= &quot;Macdonald 1981&quot;/&gt; Dominant males are highly protective of the females, however they usually can’t prevent all the subordinates from copulating.&lt;ref name= &quot;Herrera 1993&quot;/&gt; The larger the group, the harder it is for the male to watch all the females. Dominant males secure significantly more matings than each subordinate, but subordinate males, as a class, are responsible for more matings than each dominant male. &lt;ref name= &quot;Herrera 1993&quot;/&gt; The lifespan of the capybara's sperm is longer than that of other rodents.&lt;ref&gt;Paula, T. A. R., H. Chiarini-Garcia, et al. (1999). &quot;Seminiferous epithelium cycle and its duration in capybaras (Hydrochaeris hypdrochaeris).&quot; ''Tissue &amp; Cell'' 31(3): 327-334.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Capybara [[gestation]] is 130–150 days and usually produces a [[litter (animal)|litter]] of four capybara babies, but may produce between two and eight in a single litter.&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot;/&gt; Birth is on land and the female will rejoin the group within a few hours of delivering the [[newborn]] capybaras, who will join the group as soon as they are mobile. Within a week the young can eat grass, but will continue to [[suckle]] - from any female in the group - until weaned at about 16 weeks. Youngsters will form a group within the main group.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bristol&quot;/&gt; [[Alloparenting]] has been observed in this species. &lt;ref name= &quot;Macdonald 1981&quot;/&gt; The rainy season of April and May mark the peak breeding [[season]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Jungle&quot;/&gt; Like other rodents, the front teeth of capybaras grow continually to compensate for the constant wearing-down from eating grasses;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bristol&quot;/&gt; their cheek teeth also grow continuously.&lt;ref name=&quot;SFZoo&quot;/&gt; When fully grown, a capybara will have coarse hair that is sparsely spread over their skin, making the capybara prone to [[sunburn]]. To prevent this, they may roll in mud to protect their skin from the sun.&lt;ref name=&quot;rebsig-questionable-resource&quot;/&gt;

===Activities===
Capybaras are excellent swimmers and can survive completely underwater for up to five minutes,&lt;ref name=&quot;Smithsonian&quot;/&gt; an ability they will use to evade [[predator]]s.{{fact|date=November 2009}} If necessary, a capybara can sleep underwater, keeping its nose just over the waterline.{{fact|date=November 2009}}

During midday, as temperatures increase, capybaras wallow in water and graze in late afternoons and early evenings when it is cooler. They sleep little, usually dozing off and on throughout the day and grazing into and through the night.

==Conservation and human interaction==
Capybara are not on the [[IUCN]] list&lt;ref name=&quot;Chester&quot;/&gt; and therefore not considered a [[threatened species]]; their [[population]] is stable through most of their South American ranges, though in some areas hunting has reduced their numbers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bristol&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Smithsonian&quot;/&gt; 

Capybaras are hunted for their meat and [[Pelage|pelts]] in some areas,&lt;ref name=&quot;inRich&quot;/&gt; and otherwise killed by humans who see their grazing as competition for [[livestock]]. In some areas they are [[farming|farmed]], which has the effect of ensuring that the [[wetland]] [[habitats]] are protected. Their survival is aided by their ability to breed rapidly.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bristol&quot;/&gt;

Capybaras can be found in many areas in [[zoo]]s and [[park]]s,&lt;ref name=&quot;SFZoo&quot;&gt;[http://www.sfzoo.org/cgi-bin/animals.py?ID=90 San Francisco Zoo, Capybara]&lt;/ref&gt;and may live for 12 years in [[captivity (animal)|captivity]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bristol&quot;&gt;[http://www.bristolzoo.org.uk/learning/animals/mammals/capybara Bristol Zoo Gardens (UK) ''Capybara'']&lt;/ref&gt; Capybaras are gentle and will usually allow humans to pet and hand-feed them. 

The meat is said to look like pork.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jungle&quot;/&gt; During [[Lent]], capybara meat is especially popular in parts of South America, especially in [[Venezuela]], as it is claimed that the [[Catholic Church]], in a special dispensation, allowed capybara meat to be consumed on days that consumption of meat was otherwise not allowed.   There are differing accounts of how the dispensation arose.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jungle&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;rebsig-questionable-resource&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NYSun&quot;&gt;Ellsworth, Brian.

[[Image:Activemarker2.PNG|right|thumb|300px|An example of computer animation which is produced in the &quot;[[motion capture]]&quot; technique]]
{{Refimprove|date=November 2009}}
'''Computer animation''' is the process used for generating [[animation|animated images]] by using [[computer graphics]]. The more general term [[computer generated imagery]] encompasses both static scenes and dynamic images, while ''computer animation'' only refers to moving images.

Modern computer animation usually uses [[3D computer graphics]], although [[2D computer graphics]] are still used for stylistic, low bandwidth, and faster real-time renderings. Sometimes the target of the animation is the computer itself, but sometimes the target is another [[Recording medium|medium]], such as [[film]]. 

Computer animation is essentially a digital successor to the [[stop motion]] techniques used in [[traditional animation]] with 3D models and frame-by-frame animation of 2D illustrations. Computer generated animations are more controllable than other more physically based processes, such as constructing [[Miniature effect|miniatures]] for effects shots or hiring [[extra (drama)|extras]] for crowd scenes, and because it allows the creation of images that would not be feasible using any other technology. It can also allow a single graphic artist to produce such content without the use of actors, expensive set pieces, or props.

To create the illusion of movement, an image is displayed on the [[computer display|computer screen]] and repeatedly replaced by a new image that is similar to the previous image, but advanced slightly in the time domain (usually at a rate of 24 or 30 frames/second). This technique is identical to how the illusion of movement is achieved with [[television]] and [[film|motion pictures]]. 

For 3D animations, objects (models) are built on the computer monitor (modeled) and 3D figures are rigged with a virtual skeleton. For 2D figure animations, separate objects (illustrations) and separate transparent layers are used, with or without a virtual skeleton. Then the limbs, eyes, mouth, clothes, etc. of the figure are moved by the animator on [[key frame]]s. The differences in appearance between key frames are automatically calculated by the computer in a process known as [[tweening]] or [[morphing]]. Finally, the animation is [[Rendering (computer graphics)|rendered]]. 

For 3D animations, all frames must be rendered after modeling is complete. For 2D vector animations, the rendering process is the key frame illustration process, while tweened frames are rendered as needed. For pre-recorded presentations, the rendered frames are transferred to a different format or medium such as film or digital video. The frames may also be rendered in real time as they are presented to the end-user audience. Low bandwidth animations transmitted via the internet (e.g. [[Adobe Flash|2D Flash]], [[X3D]]) often use software on the end-users computer to render in real time as an alternative to [[streaming media|streaming]] or pre-loaded high bandwidth animations.

==A simple example==
 [[Image:CompAnimationExample.gif|right|146px|framed|Computer animation example]]
The screen is blanked to a background color, such as black. Then, a goat is drawn on the right of the screen. Next, the screen is blanked, but the goat is re-drawn or duplicated slightly to the left of its original position. This process is repeated, each time moving the goat a bit to the left. If this process is repeated fast enough, the goat will appear to move smoothly to the left. This basic procedure is used for all moving pictures in films and television.

The moving goat is an example of shifting the location of an object. More complex transformations of object properties such as size, shape, lighting effects often require calculations and [[computer rendering]] instead of simple re-drawing or duplication.

==Explanation==
To trick the [[Human eye|eye]] and [[Human brain|brain]] into thinking they are seeing a smoothly moving object, the pictures should be drawn at around 12 [[frame rate|frames per second]] (frame/s) or faster (a [[Film frame|frame]] is one complete image). With rates above 70 frames/s no improvement in realism or smoothness is perceivable due to the way the eye and brain process images. At rates below 12 frame/s most people can detect [[jerkiness]] associated with the drawing of new images which detracts from the illusion of realistic movement. Conventional hand-drawn cartoon animation often uses 15 frames/s in order to save on the number of drawings needed, but this is usually accepted because of the stylized nature of cartoons. Because it produces more realistic imagery computer animation demands higher frame rates to reinforce this realism.

Movie film seen in theaters in the United States runs at 24 frames per second, which is sufficient to create the illusion of continuous movement.

== History ==
{{Main|History of computer animation|}}
{{See also|Timeline of computer animation in film and television}}
One of the earliest steps in the [[history of computer animation]] was the 1973 movie ''[[Westworld]],'' a science-fiction film about a society in which robots live and work among humans, though the first use of 3D Wireframe imagery was in its sequel, ''[[Futureworld]]'' (1976), which featured a computer-generated hand and face created by then [[University of Utah]] graduate students [[Edwin Catmull]] and [[Fred Parke]].

Developments in CGI technologies are reported each year at [[SIGGRAPH]], an annual conference on computer graphics and interactive techniques, attended each year by tens of thousands of computer professionals.  Developers of computer games and 3D video cards strive to achieve the same visual quality on personal computers in real-time as is possible for CGI films and animation. With the rapid advancement of real-time rendering quality, artists began to use [[game engine]]s to render non-interactive movies. This art form is called ''[[machinima]]''.

==Methods of animating virtual characters==
[[Image:Stickwalkav.gif|thumb|left|In this [[Graphics Interchange Format|.gif]] of a 2D [[Adobe Flash|Flash]] animation, each 'stick' of the [[stick figure|figure]] is [[Keyframe#Animation by means of computer graphics|keyframed]] over time to create motion.]]
&lt;!--[[Image:FromRealToReal.jpg|thumb|200px|In [[motion capture]], the positions of the white dots on the actor's face and body are recorded in 3D, as shown here with ''Pirates of the Caribbean'' character Davy Jones.]] This is a non-free image and no rationale for it's use on this page exists --&gt;
In most 3D computer animation systems, an animator creates a simplified representation of a character's anatomy, analogous to a [[skeleton]] or [[stick figure]]. The position of each segment of the skeletal model is defined by ''animation variables'', or [[Avar (animation variable)|Avars]].
In human and animal characters, many parts of the skeletal model correspond to actual bones, but [[skeletal animation]] is also used to animate other things, such as facial features (though other methods for [[facial animation]] exist). The character &quot;Woody&quot; in ''[[Toy Story]]'', for example, uses 700 Avars, including 100 Avars in the face. The computer does not usually [[Rendering (computer graphics)|render]] the skeletal model directly (it is invisible), but uses the skeletal model to compute the exact position and orientation of the character, which is eventually rendered into an image. Thus by changing the values of Avars over time, the animator creates motion by making the character move from frame to frame.

There are several methods for generating the Avar values to obtain realistic motion. Traditionally, animators manipulate the Avars directly. Rather than set Avars for every frame, they usually set Avars at strategic points (frames) in time and let the computer interpolate or '[[tweening|tween]]' between them, a process called [[Keyframe#Animation by means of computer graphics|keyframing]]. Keyframing puts control in the hands of the animator, and has roots in hand-drawn [[traditional animation]].

In contrast, a newer method called [[motion capture]] makes use of [[live action]]. When computer animation is driven by motion capture, a real performer acts out the scene as if they were the character to be animated. His or her motion is recorded to a computer using [[video camera]]s and markers, and that performance is then applied to the animated character.

Each method has its advantages, and as of 2007, games and films are using either or both of these methods in productions. Keyframe animation can produce motions that would be difficult or impossible to act out, while motion capture can reproduce the subtleties of a particular actor. For example, in the 2006 film [[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest]], actor [[Bill Nighy]] provided the performance for the character [[Davy Jones (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Davy Jones]]. Even though Nighy himself doesn't appear in the film, the movie benefited from his performance by recording the nuances of his body language, posture, facial expressions, etc. Thus motion capture is appropriate in situations where believable, realistic behavior and action is required, but the types of characters required exceed what can be done through conventional costuming.

==Creating characters and objects on a computer==
3D computer animation combines 3D models of objects and programmed or hand &quot;keyframed&quot; movement. Models are constructed out of geometrical vertices, faces, and edges in a 3D coordinate system. Objects are sculpted much like real clay or plaster, working from general forms to specific details with various sculpting tools. A bone/joint animation system is set up to deform the CGI model (e.g., to make a humanoid model walk). In a process called rigging, the virtual marionette is given various controllers and handles for controlling movement. Animation data can be created using [[motion capture]], or [[keyframing]] by a human animator, or a combination of the two.

3D models rigged for animation may contain thousands of control points - for example, the character &quot;Woody&quot; in [[Pixar]]'s movie ''[[Toy Story]]'', uses 700 specialized animation controllers. [[Rhythm and Hues Studios]] labored for two years to create [[Aslan]] in the movie ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe]]'' which had about 1851 controllers, 742 in just the face alone. In the 2004 film ''[[The Day After Tomorrow]]'', designers had to design forces of extreme weather with the help of video references and accurate meteorological facts. For the [[King Kong (2005 film)|2005 remake]] of ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'', actor [[Andy Serkis]] was used to help designers pinpoint the gorilla's prime location in the shots and used his expressions to model &quot;human&quot; characteristics onto the creature. Serkis had earlier provided the voice and performance for [[Gollum]] in [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' trilogy.

==Computer animation development equipment==
[[Image:Jack-in-cube solid model, light background.gif|right|thumb|100px]]

Computer animation can be created with a computer and animation software. Some impressive animation can be achieved even with basic programs; however, the [[Rendering (computer graphics)|render]]ing can take a lot of time on an ordinary home computer. Because of this, [[video game]] animators tend to use low resolution, low polygon count renders, such that the graphics can be rendered in real time on a home computer. Photorealistic animation would be impractical in this context.

Professional animators of movies, television, and video sequences on computer games make photorealistic animation with high detail. This level of quality for movie animation would take tens to hundreds of years to create on a home computer. Many powerful [[workstation]] computers are used instead. Graphics workstation computers use two to four processors, and thus are a lot more powerful than a home computer, and are specialized for [[Rendering (computer graphics)|render]]ing. A large number of workstations (known as a [[render farm]]) are networked together to effectively act as a giant computer. The result is a computer-animated movie that can be completed in about one to five years (this process is not comprised solely of rendering, however). A workstation typically costs $2,000 to $16,000, with the more expensive stations being able to render much faster, due to the more technologically advanced hardware that they contain. [[Pixar]]'s [[Renderman]] is rendering software which is widely used as the movie animation industry standard, in competition with [[Mental Ray]]. It can be bought at the official Pixar website for about $3,500. It will work on [[Linux]], [[Mac OS X]], and [[Microsoft Windows]] based graphics workstations along with an animation program such as [[Autodesk Maya|Maya]] and Softimage XSI. Professionals also use digital [[movie camera]]s, [[motion capture]] or [[performance capture]], [[bluescreen]]s, [[List of video editing software|film editing software]], [[Theatrical property|prop]]s, and other tools for movie animation.

==Modeling human faces==
{{Main|Computer facial animation}}
The modeling of human facial features is both one of the most challenging and sought after elements in computer-generated imagery. [[Computer facial animation]] is a highly complex field where models typically include a very large number of [[Avar (animation variable)|animation variables]]. Historically speaking, the first [[SIGGRAPH]] tutorials on ''State of the art in Facial Animation'' in 1989 and 1990 proved to be a turning point in the field by bringing together and consolidating multiple research elements, and sparked interest among a number of researchers.&lt;ref&gt;''Computer facial animation'' by Frederic I. Parke, Keith Waters 2008 ISBN 1-56881-448-8 page xi&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Facial Action Coding System]] (with 46 ''action units'' such as &quot;lip bite&quot; or &quot;squint&quot;) which had been developed in 1976 became a popular basis for many systems.&lt;ref name=Magnenat122 &gt;'Handbook of Virtual Humans'' by Nadia Magnenat-Thalmann and Daniel Thalmann, 2004 ISBN 0-470-02316-3 pages 122&lt;/ref&gt; As early as 2001 [[MPEG-4]] included 68 facial animation parameters for lips, jaws, etc., and the field has made significant progress since then and the use of facial [[microexpression]] has increased.&lt;ref&gt;''The MPEG-4 book'' by Fernando C. N. Pereira, Touradj Ebrahimi 2002 ISBN 0-13-061621-4 page 404&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Magnenat122 /&gt;

In some cases, an [[Affect measures|affective space]] such as the [[PAD emotional state model]] can be used to assign specific emotions to the faces of [[avatar (computing)|avatars]]. In this approach the PAD model is used as a high level emotional space, and the lower level space is the [[MPEG-4]] Facial Animation Parameters (FAP). A mid-level Partial Expression Parameters (PEP) space is then used to in a two level structure: the PAD-PEP mapping and the PEP-FAP translation model.&lt;ref&gt;S. Zhang et. al ''Facial Expression Synthesis using PAD Emotional Parameters for a Chinese Expressive Avatar'' in &quot;Affective computing and intelligent interaction&quot; edited by Ana Paiva, Rui Prada, Rosalind W. Picard 2007 ISBN 3-540-74888-1 pages 24-33&lt;/ref&gt;

==The future==
One open challenge in computer animation is a photorealistic animation of humans. Currently, most computer-animated movies show animal characters (''[[A Bug's Life]]'', ''[[Finding Nemo]]'', ''[[Ratatouille (film)|Ratatouille]]'', ''[[Ice Age (movie)|Ice Age]]'', ''[[Over the Hedge (film)|Over the Hedge]]'', ''[[Open Season (film)|Open Season]]''), fantasy characters (''[[Monsters Inc.]]'', ''[[Shrek]]'', ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 4]]'', ''[[Monsters vs. Aliens]]''), [[anthropomorphic]] machines (''[[Cars (movie)|Cars]]'', ''[[WALL-E]]'', ''[[Robots (movie)|Robots]]'') or cartoon-like humans (''[[The Incredibles]]'', ''[[Despicable Me]]'', ''[[Up (2009 film)|Up]]''). The movie ''[[Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within]]'' is often cited as the first computer-generated movie to attempt to show realistic-looking humans. However, due to the enormous complexity of the human body, human motion, and human biomechanics, realistic simulation of humans remains largely an open problem. Another problem is the distasteful psychological response to viewing nearly perfect animation of humans, known as &quot;the [[uncanny valley]].&quot; It is one of the &quot;holy grails&quot; of computer animation. Eventually, the goal is to create software where the animator can generate a movie sequence showing a photorealistic human character, undergoing physically plausible motion, together with clothes, photorealistic hair, a complicated natural background, and possibly interacting with other simulated human characters. This could be done in a way that the viewer is no longer able to tell if a particular movie sequence is computer-generated, or created using real actors in front of movie cameras. Complete human realism is not likely to happen very soon,{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} but when it does it may have major repercussions for the film industry.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

For the moment it looks like three dimensional computer animation can be divided into two main directions; photorealistic and non-photorealistic rendering. Photorealistic computer animation can itself be divided into two subcategories; real photorealism (where [[performance capture]] is used in the creation of the virtual human characters) and stylized photorealism. Real photorealism is what Final Fantasy tried to achieve and will in the future most likely have the ability to give us live action fantasy features as ''[[The Dark Crystal]]'' without having to use advanced puppetry and animatronics, while ''[[Antz]]'' is an example on stylistic photorealism (in the future stylized photorealism will be able to replace traditional stop motion animation as in ''[[Corpse Bride]]''). None of these mentioned are perfected as of yet, but the progress continues.

The non-photorealistic/cartoonish direction is more like an extension of traditional animation, an attempt to make the animation look like a three dimensional version of a cartoon, still using and perfecting the main principles of animation articulated by the [[Nine Old Men]], such as squash and stretch. 

While a single frame from a photorealistic computer-animated feature will look like a photo if done right, a single frame vector from a cartoonish computer-animated feature will look like a painting (not to be confused with [[cel shading]], which produces an even simpler look).

==Detailed examples and pseudocode==
In 2D computer animation, moving objects are often referred to as “[[sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]]s.” A sprite is an image that has a location associated with it. The location of the sprite is changed slightly, between each displayed frame, to make the sprite appear to move. The following [[pseudocode]] makes a sprite move from left to right:

 '''var''' ''int'' x := 0, y := screenHeight / 2;
 '''while''' x &lt; screenWidth
 drawBackground()
 drawSpriteAtXY (x, y) ''// draw on top of the background''
 x := x + 5 ''// move to the right''

Computer animation uses different techniques to produce animations. Most frequently, sophisticated [[mathematics]] is used to manipulate complex three dimensional [[polygon]]s, apply “[[Texture mapping|texture]]s”, lighting and other effects to the polygons and finally [[Rendering (computer graphics)|rendering]] the complete image. A sophisticated [[graphical user interface]] may be used to create the animation and arrange its choreography. Another technique called [[constructive solid geometry]] defines objects by conducting boolean operations on regular shapes, and has the advantage that animations may be accurately produced at any resolution.

Let's step through the rendering of a simple image of a room with flat wood walls with a grey pyramid in the center of the room. The pyramid will have a spotlight shining on it. Each wall, the floor and the ceiling is a simple polygon, in this case, a rectangle. Each corner of the rectangles is defined by three values referred to as X, Y and Z. X is how far left and right the point is. Y is how far up and down the point is, and Z is far in and out of the screen the point is. The wall nearest us would be defined by four points: (in the order x, y, z). Below is a representation of how the wall is defined

&lt;pre&gt;
(0, 10, 0)                        (10, 10, 0)

(0,0,0)                           (10, 0, 0)
&lt;/pre&gt;

The far wall would be:
&lt;pre&gt;
(0, 10, 20)                        (10, 10, 20)

(0, 0, 20)                         (10, 0, 20)
&lt;/pre&gt;

The pyramid is made up of five polygons: the rectangular base, and four triangular sides. To draw this image the computer uses math to calculate how to project this image, defined by three dimensional data, onto a two dimensional computer screen.

First we must also define where our view point is, that is, from what vantage point will the scene be drawn. Our view point is inside the room a bit above the floor, directly in front of the pyramid. First the computer will calculate which polygons are visible. The near wall will not be displayed at all, as it is behind our view point. The far side of the pyramid will also not be drawn as it is hidden by the front of the pyramid.

Next each point is perspective projected onto the screen. The portions of the walls ‘furthest’ from the view point will appear to be shorter than the nearer areas due to perspective. To make the walls look like wood, a wood pattern, called a texture, will be drawn on them. To accomplish this, a technique called “[[texture mapping]]” is often used. A small drawing of wood that can be repeatedly drawn in a matching tiled pattern (like [[wallpaper]]) is stretched and drawn onto the walls' final shape. The pyramid is solid grey so its surfaces can just be rendered as grey. But we also have a spotlight. Where its light falls we lighten colors, where objects blocks the light we darken colors.

Next we render the complete scene on the computer screen. If the numbers describing the position of the pyramid were changed and this process repeated, the pyramid would appear to move.

==Movies==
CGI short films have been produced as [[independent animation]] since 1976, though the popularity of computer animation (especially in the field of [[special effect]]s) skyrocketed during the [[Modern animation in the United States|modern era of U.S. animation]]. The first completely computer-generated television series was ''[[ReBoot]]'', in 1994, and the first completely computer-generated animated movie was ''[[Toy Story]]'' ([[1995]]). &lt;!--Here must go a brief history--&gt; See [[List of computer-animated films]] for more.

==Amateur animation==
The popularity of [[website]]s which allows members to upload their own movies for others to view has created a growing community of [[amateur]] computer animators. With utilities and programs often included free with modern [[operating system]]s, many users can make their own animated movies and shorts. Several [[free and open source software|free and open source]] animation software applications exist as well. A popular amateur approach to animation is via the animated [[GIF]] format, which can be uploaded and seen on the web easily.

'''Ceawlin''' (also spelled '''Ceaulin''' and '''Caelin''', died ''ca.'' 593) was a King of [[Wessex]]. He may have been the son of [[Cynric of Wessex]] and the grandson of [[Cerdic of Wessex]], whom the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' represents as the leader of the first group of [[Saxons]] to come to the land which later became [[Wessex]]. Ceawlin was active during the last years of the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] invasion, with little of southern England remaining in the control of the native [[Britons (historic)|Britons]] by the time of his death.

The chronology of Ceawlin's life is highly uncertain. The historical accuracy and dating of many of the events in the later ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' have been called into question, and his reign is variously listed as lasting seven, seventeen, or thirty-two years.&lt;ref&gt;Stenton, p. 29, accepts the date given for Ceawlin's accession in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle of 560, but Barbara Yorke in her online DNB article on Ceawlin states that his reign seems to have been deliberately lengthened.&lt;/ref&gt; The Chronicle records several battles of Ceawlin's between the years 556 and 592, including the first record of a battle between different groups of Anglo-Saxons, and indicates that under Ceawlin Wessex acquired significant territory, some of which was later to be lost to other [[Heptarchy|Anglo-Saxon kingdoms]].  Ceawlin is also named as one of the eight &quot;''[[bretwalda]]s''&quot;, a title given in the Chronicle to eight rulers who had overlordship over southern Britain, although the extent of Ceawlin's control is not known.

Ceawlin died in 593, having been deposed the year before, possibly by his successor, [[Ceol of Wessex|Ceol]].  He is recorded in various sources as having two sons, Cutha and [[Cuthwine]], but the genealogies in which this information is found are known to be unreliable.

==Historical context==
The history of the [[sub-Roman Britain|sub-Roman period in Britain]] is poorly sourced and the subject of a number of important disagreements among historians.  It appears, however, that in the fifth century raids on Britain by continental peoples developed into migrations.  The newcomers included [[Angles]], [[Saxons]], [[Jutes]], and [[Frisians]].  These peoples captured territory in the east and south of England, but at about the end of the fifth century, a British victory at the battle of [[Mons Badonicus]] halted the Anglo-Saxon advance for fifty years.&lt;ref name=Blair_IASE_13&gt;Hunter Blair, ''An Introduction to Anglo-Saxon England'', pp. 13–16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Campbell_TAS_23&gt;Campbell et al., ''The Anglo-Saxons'', p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;  Near the year 550, however, the British began to lose ground once more, and within twenty-five years, it appears that control of almost all of southern England was in the hands of the invaders.&lt;ref name=Blair_RBaEE_204&gt;Hunter Blair (''Roman Britain'', p. 204) gives the twenty-five years from 550 to 575 as the dates of the final conquest.&lt;/ref&gt;

The peace following the battle of Mons Badonicus is attested partly by [[Gildas]], a monk, who  wrote ''[[De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae]]'' or ''On the Ruin and Conquest of Britain'' during the middle of the sixth century.  This essay is a polemic against corruption and Gildas provides little in the way of names and dates.  He appears, however, to state that peace had lasted from the year of his birth to the time he was writing.&lt;ref name=Stenton_2&gt;Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', pp. 2–7.&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' is the other main source that bears on this period, in particular in an entry for the year 827 that records a list of the kings who bore the title &quot;''[[bretwalda]]''&quot;, or &quot;Britain-ruler&quot;.  That list shows a gap in the early sixth century that matches Gildas's version of events.&lt;ref name=Swanton_60&gt;Swanton, ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', pp. 60–61&lt;/ref&gt;

Ceawlin's reign belongs to the period of Anglo-Saxon expansion at the end of the sixth century.  Though there are many unanswered questions about the chronology and activities of the early West Saxon rulers, it is clear that Ceawlin was one of the key figures in the final Anglo-Saxon conquest of southern Britain.&lt;ref name=Stenton_30&gt;Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early West Saxon sources==
The two main written sources for early West Saxon history are the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' and the West Saxon Genealogical Regnal List.  The ''Chronicle'' is a set of annals which were compiled near the year 890, during the reign of King [[Alfred the Great]] of [[Wessex]].&lt;ref name=KL_41&gt;Keynes and Lapidge, ''Alfred the Great'', p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;  They record earlier material for the older entries, which were assembled from earlier annals that no longer survive, as well as, from saga material that might have been transmitted orally.&lt;ref name=Swanton_xix&gt;Swanton, ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', p. xix&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Yorke_132&gt;Yorke, ''Kings and Kingdoms'', p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Chronicle dates the arrival of the future &quot;West Saxons&quot; in Britain to 495, when [[Cerdic]] and his son, [[Cynric]], land at ''Cerdices ora'', or Cerdic's shore. Almost twenty annals describing Cerdic's campaigns, and those of his descendants appear interspersed through the next hundred years of entries in the ''Chronicle''.&lt;ref name=Kirby_50&gt;Kirby, ''Earliest English Kings'', pp. 50–51.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Swanton_14&gt;Swanton, ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', pp. 14–21&lt;/ref&gt;  Although these annals provide most of what is known about Ceawlin, it also should be noted that the historicity of many of the entries is uncertain.&lt;ref name
