'). See also [[LSP dictionary]].

==Glossaries==
Another variant is the [[glossary]], an alphabetical list of defined terms in a specialised field, such as medicine or science. The simplest dictionary, a [[defining dictionary]], provides a [[core glossary]] of the simplest meanings of the simplest concepts. From these, other concepts can be explained and defined, in particular for those who are first learning a language. In English, the commercial defining dictionaries typically include only one or two meanings of under 2000 words. With these, the rest of English, and even the 4000 most common English [[idiom]]s and [[metaphor]]s, can be defined.

==Pronunciation==
{{Main|IPA chart for English dialects|Pronunciation respelling for English}}
Dictionaries for  languages for which the pronunciation of words is not apparent from their spelling, such as the English language, usually provide the pronunciation, often using the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]]. For example, the definition for the word ''dictionary'' might be followed by the phonemic spelling {{IPA-en|ˈdɪkʃənɛri|}}. American dictionaries, however, often use their own [[pronunciation spelling]] systems, for example ''dictionary'' [dĭkʹ shə nâr ē] while the IPA is more commonly used within the British Commonwealth countries. Yet others use an ''ad hoc'' notation; for example, ''dictionary'' may become [DIK-shuh-nair-ee]. Some on-line or electronic dictionaries provide recordings of words being spoken.

===Prescription and description===
Lexicographers apply two basic philosophies to the defining of words: [[Prescription and description|''prescriptive'' or ''descriptive'']].  [[Noah Webster]], intent on forging a distinct identity for the American language, altered spellings and accentuated differences in meaning and pronunciation of some words. This is why [[American English]] now uses the spelling ''color'' while the rest of the English-speaking world prefers ''colour''. (Similarly, [[British English]] subsequently underwent a few spelling changes that did not affect American English; see further at [[American and British English spelling differences]].)  Large 20th-century dictionaries such as the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (OED) and  [[Webster's Third New International Dictionary|Webster's Third]] are descriptive, and attempt to describe the actual use of words.

[[File:Dictionary through lens.JPG|thumb|left|250 px|A dictionary open at the word &quot;[[Internet]]&quot;, viewed through a [[Lens (optics)|lens]]]]
While descriptivists argue that prescriptivism is an unnatural attempt to dictate usage or curtail change, prescriptivists argue that to indiscriminately document &quot;improper&quot; or &quot;inferior&quot; usages sanctions those usages by default and causes language to deteriorate. Although the debate can become very heated, only a small number of controversial words are usually affected. But the softening of usage notations, from the previous edition, for two words, ''ain't'' and ''irregardless'', out of over 450,000 in Webster's Third in 1961, was enough to provoke outrage among many with prescriptivist leanings, who branded the dictionary as &quot;permissive.&quot;

The prescriptive/descriptive issue has been given much consideration in modern times. Most dictionaries of English now apply the descriptive method to a word's definition, and then, outside of the definition itself, add information alerting readers to attitudes which may influence their choices on words often considered vulgar, offensive, erroneous, or easily confused. ''[[Merriam-Webster]]'' is subtle, only adding italicized notations such as, ''sometimes offensive'' or ''nonstand'' (nonstandard.) [[American Heritage Dictionary|''American Heritage'']] goes further, discussing issues separately in numerous &quot;usage notes.&quot; [[Encarta Webster's Dictionary|''Encarta]]'' provides similar notes, but is more prescriptive, offering warnings and admonitions against the use of certain words considered by many to be offensive or illiterate, such as, &quot;an offensive term for...&quot; or &quot;a taboo term meaning...&quot;

Because of the widespread use of dictionaries, and their acceptance by many as language authorities, their treatment of the language does affect usage to some degree, even the most descriptive dictionaries providing conservative continuity. In the long run, however, the meanings of words in English are primarily determined by usage, and the language is being changed and created every day. As [[Jorge Luis Borges]] says in the prologue to &quot;El otro, el mismo&quot;: &quot;''It is often forgotten that (dictionaries) are artificial repositories, put together well after the languages they define. The roots of language are irrational and of a magical nature.''&quot;

'''David Director Friedman''' (born February 12, 1945) is an [[United States|American]] [[economist]], [[author]], and [[libertarianism|libertarian]] theorist. He is known as a leader in anarchist political theory, which is the subject of his most popular book, ''[[The Machinery of Freedom]]'' (1973, revised 1989). He has authored others, including ''Price Theory: An Intermediate Text'' (1986), ''Law's Order: What Economics Has to Do with Law and Why It Matters'' (2000), ''Hidden Order: The Economics of Everyday Life'' (1996), and ''Future Imperfect'' (2008).&lt;ref&gt;Free Market Mojo. [http://freemarketmojo.com/?p=5539 &quot;An Interview with David D. Friedman&quot;].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and work==

David Friedman is the son of economists [[Milton Friedman|Milton]] and [[Rose Friedman]]. His son, [[Patri Friedman]], has also written about anarcho-capitalism, particularly [[seasteading]]. David Friedman holds an [[Bachelor of Arts|A.B.]] from [[Harvard University]] and a [[Ph.D.]] in [[Physics]] from the [[University of Chicago]], although he is most known for work in other fields. He is currently a professor of law at [[Santa Clara University]], and a contributing editor for ''[[Liberty (1987)|Liberty]]'' magazine. He is an atheist.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, David D. [http://daviddfriedman.blogspot.com/2008/01/atheism-and-religion.html &quot;Atheism and Religion&quot;], ''Ideas''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anarcho-capitalism===
In his book ''The Machinery of Freedom'' (1973), Friedman sketched a form of [[anarcho-capitalism]] where all goods and services including law itself can be produced by the [[free market]]. This differs from the version proposed by [[Murray Rothbard]], where a legal code would first be consented to by the parties involved in setting up the anarcho-capitalist society. Friedman advocates an incrementalist approach to achieve anarcho-capitalism by gradual [[privatization]] of areas that government is involved in, ultimately privatizing law and order itself. In the book, he states his opposition to violent [[anarcho-capitalist revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Machinery of Freedom|pages=149–150|chapter=Revolution Is the Hell of It|author=Friedman, David D|isbn=0-8126-9069-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He uses a [[consequentialist]] version of anarcho-capitalism. Friedman's version of [[individualist anarchism]] is not based on the assumption of inviolable natural rights but rather rests on a [[cost-benefit analysis]] of state versus no state.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, Christopher. 1992. An Essay on the Modern State. Cambridge University Press. p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; It is contrasted with the [[deontological libertarianism|natural-rights]] approach as propounded most notably by [[Austrian School]] economist, libertarian theorist and anarcho-capitalist founder [[Murray Rothbard]].

==Non-academic interests==
Friedman is a longtime member of the [[Society for Creative Anachronism]], where he is known as ''Duke Cariadoc of the Bow''. He is known throughout the worldwide society for his articles on the philosophy of recreationism and practical historical recreations, especially those relating to the medieval [[Middle East]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.daviddfriedman.com/Medieval/Restructuring.html Friedman, David D. &quot;On Restructuring the SCA&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; His work is compiled in the popular ''Cariadoc's Miscellany''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pbm.com/~lindahl/cariadoc/miscellany.html Cariadoc's Miscellany]&lt;/ref&gt; He is sometimes credited with founding the largest and longest-running SCA event, the [[Pennsic War]]; as king of the Middle Kingdom he challenged the East Kingdom, and later as king of the East accepted the challenge…and lost.&lt;ref&gt;F.L. Watkins (Fólki Þorgilsson). 2005. ''HERSTAĐR-SAGA: An Incomplete History of Pennsic'' © Folump Enterprises&lt;/ref&gt; 

He is a long-time [[science fiction]] [[science fiction fandom|fan]], and has written a [[fantasy]] novel, ''Harald'' ([[Baen Books]], 2006).

'''Diatomic molecules''' are molecules composed only of two [[atom]]s, of either the same or different [[chemical element]]s. The prefix di- means two in Greek. Common diatomic molecules are [[hydrogen]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), [[nitrogen]] (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), [[oxygen]] (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and [[carbon monoxide]] (CO).  Seven elements exist in the diatomic state in the liquid and solid forms: H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
, N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Most elements (and many [[chemical compound]]s) aside from these form diatomic molecules when evaporated, although at very high temperatures, ''all'' materials disintegrate into atoms. The [[noble gases]] do not form diatomic molecules.

==Occurrence==
Hundreds of diatomic molecules have been characterized&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| author = Huber, K. P. and Herzberg, G. | title = Molecular Spectra and Molecular Structure IV. Constants of Diatomic Molecules | publisher = New York: Van Nostrand: Reinhold | year = 1979 | id= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the terrestrial environment, laboratory, and [[List of molecules in interstellar space|interstellar medium]].  About 99% of the [[Earth's atmosphere]] is composed of diatomic molecules, specifically oxygen and nitrogen at 21 and 78%, respectively.  The natural abundance of [[hydrogen| hydrogen (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)]] in the Earth's atmosphere is only on the order of parts per million, but H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is, in fact, the most abundant diatomic molecule seen in nature.  The interstellar medium is, indeed, dominated by hydrogen atoms.

Elements that consist of diatomic molecules, under typical laboratory conditions of 1 bar and 25 °C, include  hydrogen (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), nitrogen (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), oxygen (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and the halogens.&lt;ref&gt;Relative to the other halogens ([[fluorine]], [[chlorine]], [[bromine]], and [[iodine]]), [[astatine]] is so rare, with its most stable [[isotope]] having a [[half-life]] of only 8.3 hours, that it is usually not considered.{{Cite book| author = Emsley, J. | title = The Elements | publisher = Oxford: Clarendon Press | year = 1989 | pages = 22–23| id= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Again, many other diatomics are possible and form when elements are evaporated, but these diatomic species repolymerize at lower temperatures.  For example, heating (&quot;cracking&quot;) elemental phosphorus gives [[diphosphorus]].

If a diatomic molecule consists of two atoms of the same element, such as H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, then it is said to be [[Homonuclear molecule|homonuclear]], but otherwise it is [[Heteronuclear molecule|heteronuclear]], such as with CO or NO.  The bond in a homonuclear diatomic molecule is non-polar and [[Covalent bond|covalent]].  In most diatomic molecules, the elements are nonidentical.  Prominent examples include [[carbon monoxide]], [[nitric oxide]], and [[hydrogen chloride]], but other important examples include gaseous MgO, SiO, and many other species not normally considered diatomic because they [[polymerize]] at room temperature.

==Molecular geometry==
{{Main|molecular geometry}}

Diatomic molecules cannot have any [[molecular geometry|geometry]] but linear, as any two points always lie in a line. This is the simplest [[stereochemistry|spatial arrangement of atoms]] after the sphericity of single atoms.&lt;ref name = &quot;qpxlgb&quot;&gt;&quot;VSEPR - A Summary&quot;. University of Berkeley College of Chemistry. 20 January 2008. http://mc2.cchem.berkeley.edu/VSEPR/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical significance==
Diatomic elements played an important role in the elucidation of the concepts of element, atom, and molecule in the 19th century, because some of the most common elements, such as hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen, occur as diatomic molecules. [[John Dalton]]'s original atomic hypothesis assumed that all elements were monatomic and that the atoms in compounds would normally have the simplest atomic ratios with respect to one another. For example, Dalton assumed that water's formula was HO, giving the atomic weight of oxygen as 8 times that of hydrogen, instead of the modern value of about 16. As a consequence, confusion existed regarding atomic weights and molecular formulas for about half a century.

As early as 1805, [[Gay-Lussac]] and [[von Humboldt]] showed that water is formed of two volumes of hydrogen and one volume of oxygen, and by 1811 [[Amedeo Avogadro]] had arrived at the correct interpretation of water's composition, based on what is now called [[Avogadro's law]] and the assumption of diatomic elemental molecules.  However, these results were mostly ignored until 1860.  Part of this rejection was due to the belief that atoms of one element would have no [[chemical affinity]] towards atoms of the same element, and part was due to apparent exceptions to Avogadro's law that were not explained until later in terms of dissociating molecules.

At the 1860 [[Karlsruhe Congress]] on atomic weights, [[Cannizzaro]] resurrected Avogadro's ideas and used them to produce a consistent table of atomic weights, which mostly agree with modern values.  These weights were an important pre-requisite for the discovery of the [[periodic law]] by [[Dmitri Mendeleev]] and [[Lothar Meyer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| author = Ihde, Aaron J. | title = The Karlsruhe Congress: A centennial retrospective. | journal = Journal of Chemical Education | year = 1961 | volume = 38 | pages = 83–86 | url = http://search.jce.divched.org:8081/JCEIndex/FMPro?-db=jceindex.fp5&amp;-lay=wwwform&amp;combo=karlsruhe&amp;-find=&amp;-format=detail.html&amp;-skip=0&amp;-max=1&amp;-token.2=0&amp;-token.3=10 | accessdate=2007-08-24 | doi = 10.1021/ed038p83 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Energy levels==
It is convenient, and common, to represent a diatomic molecule as two point masses (the two atoms) connected by a massless spring.  The energies involved in the various motions of the molecule can then be broken down into three categories.

* The translational energies
* The rotational energies
* The vibrational energies

===Translational energies===
The translational energy of the molecule is simply given by the [[kinetic energy]] expression:

:&lt;math&gt;E_{trans}=\frac{1}{2}mv^2&lt;/math&gt;

where ''m'' is the mass of the molecule and ''v'' is its velocity.

===Rotational energies===
Classically, the kinetic energy of rotation is
::&lt;math&gt;E_{rot} = \frac{L^2}{2 I} \,&lt;/math&gt;
:where
::&lt;math&gt;L \,&lt;/math&gt; is the [[angular momentum]]
::&lt;math&gt;I \,&lt;/math&gt; is the [[moment of inertia]] of the molecule

For microscopic, atomic-level systems like a molecule, angular momentum can only have specific discrete values given by
::&lt;math&gt;L^2 = l(l+1) \hbar^2 \,&lt;/math&gt;
:where ''l'' is a non-negative integer and &lt;math&gt;\hbar&lt;/math&gt; is the [[reduced Planck constant]].

Also, for a diatomic molecule the moment of inertia is
::&lt;math&gt;I = \mu r_{0}^2 \,&lt;/math&gt;
:where
::&lt;math&gt;\mu \,&lt;/math&gt; is the [[reduced mass]] of the molecule and
::&lt;math&gt;r_{0} \,&lt;/math&gt; is the average distance between the two atoms in the molecule.

So, substituting the angular momentum and moment of inertia into E&lt;sub&gt;rot&lt;/sub&gt;, the rotational energy levels of a diatomic molecule are given by:
::&lt;math style&gt;E_{rot} = \frac{l(l+1) \hbar^2}{2 \mu r_{0}^2} \ \ \ \ \ l=0,1,2,... \,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

===Vibrational energies===
Another way a diatomic molecule can move is to have each atom oscillate - or [[Vibration|vibrate]] - along a line (the bond) connecting the two atoms.  The vibrational energy is approximately that of a [[quantum harmonic oscillator]]:

::&lt;math&gt;E_{vib} = \left(n+\frac{1}{2} \right)\hbar \omega \ \ \ \ \ n=0,1,2,.... \,&lt;/math&gt;
:where
::''n'' is an integer
::&lt;math&gt;\hbar&lt;/math&gt; is the [[reduced Planck constant]] and
::&lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is the [[angular frequency]] of the vibration.

===Comparison between rotational and vibrational energy spacings===
The lowest rotational energy level of a diatomic molecule occurs for &lt;math&gt;l=0&lt;/math&gt; and gives E&lt;sub&gt;rot&lt;/sub&gt; = 0. For O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the next highest quantum level (&lt;math&gt;l=1&lt;/math&gt;) has an energy of roughly:
::{|
|&lt;math&gt;E_{rot,1} \,&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;= \frac{\hbar^2}{2 m_{O_{2}} r_{0}^2} \,&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;\approx \frac{\left(1.05 \times 10^{-34} \  \mathrm{J\cdot s} \right)^2}{2 \left(27 \times 10^{-27} \ \mathrm{kg} \right) \left(10^{-10} \ \mathrm{m} \right)^2} \,&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;\approx 2 \times 10^{-23} \ \mathrm{J}. \,&lt;/math&gt;
|}

This spacing between the lowest two ''rotational'' energy levels of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is comparable to that of a [[photon]] in the [[microwave]] region of the electromagnetic spectrum.

The lowest ''vibrational'' energy level occurs for &lt;math&gt;n=0&lt;/math&gt;, and a typical vibration frequency is 5 x 10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; Hz.  Doing a calculation similar to that above gives:
::&lt;math&gt;E_{vib,0} \approx 3 \times 10^{-21} \ \mathrm{J}. \,&lt;/math&gt;

So the spacing, and the energy of a typical spectroscopic transition, between ''vibrational'' energy levels is about 100 times greater than that of a typical transition between ''[[rotational energy]]'' levels.

A true '''duopoly''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''dyo / δυο'' (two) + ''polein / πωλειν'' (to sell)) is a specific type of [[oligopoly]] where only two producers exist in one [[market]]. In reality, this definition is generally used where only two firms have dominant control over a [[market]]. In the field of [[industrial organization]], it is the most commonly studied form of oligopoly due to its simplicity.

==Duopoly models in economics==
There are two principal duopoly models, [[Cournot duopoly]] and [[Bertrand duopoly]]:

*The [[Cournot]] model, which shows that two firms assume each others output and treat this as a fixed amount, and produce in their own firm according to this.

*The [[Joseph Louis François Bertrand|Bertrand]] model, in which, in a game of two firms, each one of them will assume that the other will not change prices in response to its price cuts. When both firms use this logic, they will reach a [[Nash Equilibrium]].

==Politics==
Modern [[Politics of the United States|American politics]] has been described as a duopoly since the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] parties have dominated and framed [[policy]] debate as well as the public discourse on matters of national concern for about a century and a half. [[Third Parties]] have encountered various blocks in getting onto ballots at different levels of government as well as other electoral obstacles, more so in recent decades.

''See [[List of political parties in the United States]] for a more comprehensive look at the politics of the [[Two-party system]],  [[Duverger's law]].''

==Examples in business==
The most commonly cited duopoly is that between [[Visa Inc.|Visa]] and [[Mastercard]], who between them control a large proportion of the electronic payment processing market. In 2000 they were the defendants in a [[United States Department of Justice|US Department of Justice]] [[Sherman Antitrust Act|antitrust]] lawsuit.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.usdoj.gov/atr/cases/f1900/1973.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://mit.edu/thistle/www/v12/2/credit.html&lt;/ref&gt; An appeal was upheld in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4014599.stm&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples where two companies control a large proportion of a market are:

*[[Leitner-Poma]] and [[Doppelmayr CTEC]] in the [[chairlift]] industry.

==Media==
In Finland, the state-owned broadcasting company [[Yleisradio]] and the private broadcaster [[MTV3|Mainos-TV]] had a legal duopoly (in the economists' sense of the word) from the 1950s to 1993. No other broadcasters were allowed. Mainos-TV operated by leasing air time from Yleisradio, broadcasting in reserved blocks between Yleisradio's own programming on its two channels. This was a unique phenomenon in the world. Between 1986 and 1992 there was an independent third channel but it was jointly owned by Yle and MTV; only in 1993 did MTV get its own channel.
Safaricom mobile service provider and Zain in Kenya are perfect examples of Duopoly market in African telecommunication industry.

==Broadcasting==
{{Main|Duopoly (broadcasting)}}
[[Duopoly (broadcasting)|Duopoly]] is also used in the [[United States]] broadcast television and radio industry to refer to a single company owning two outlets in the same city.

This usage is technically incompatible with the normal definition of the word and leads to confusion, inasmuch as there are generally more than two owners of broadcast television stations in markets with broadcast duopolies. In [[Canada]], this definition is therefore more commonly called a &quot;[[twinstick]]&quot;.

==Board Games==
The board game [[Monopoly Junior]] is sometimes referred to as &quot;Duopoly&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

'''''Dungeons &amp; Dragons''''' (abbreviated as '''''D&amp;D'''''&lt;ref name=&quot;D&amp;Dfaq&quot;&gt;[[#refMead|Mead, Malcomson; ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' FAQ]]&lt;/ref&gt; or '''''DnD''''') is a [[fantasy]] [[role-playing game]] (RPG) originally designed by [[Gary Gygax]] and [[Dave Arneson]], and first published in 1974 by [[TSR, Inc.|Tactical Studies Rules, Inc.]] (TSR). The game has been published by [[Wizards of the Coast]] since 1997. It was derived from [[miniature wargaming|miniature wargames]] with a variation of the ''[[chainmail (game)|Chainmail]]'' game serving as the initial rule system.&lt;ref name=&quot;Banshee_Gygax&quot; /&gt; ''D&amp;D''{{'s}} publication is widely regarded as the beginning of modern role-playing games and the role-playing game industry.&lt;ref name=&quot;culture intro&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Williams|Hendricks|Winkler|2006}} introduction&lt;/ref&gt;

''D&amp;D'' departs from traditional wargaming and assigns each player a specific [[Player character|character]] to play instead of a [[military formation]]. These characters embark upon imaginary adventures within a fantasy [[setting (literature)|setting]]. A [[Dungeon Master]] serves as the game's referee and storyteller, while also maintaining the setting in which the adventures occur. The characters form a party that interacts with the setting's inhabitants (and each other). Together they solve dilemmas, engage in battles and gather treasure and knowledge.&lt;ref name=&quot;culture intro&quot;/&gt; In the process the characters earn [[experience points]] to become increasingly powerful over a series of sessions.

The early success of ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' led to a proliferation of similar game systems. Despite this competition, ''D&amp;D'' enjoys a dominant market position in the role-playing game industry.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Frankly, the difference in sales between Wizards and all other producers of roleplaying games is so staggering that even saying there is an 'RPG industry' at all may be generous.&quot; (Cook; The Open Game License as I see it){{Verify credibility|date=March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977, the game was split into two versions: the looser, more open framework game system of ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' and the much tighter and more structured game system of ''[[Editions of Dungeons &amp; Dragons#Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons|Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'' (abbreviated as ''AD&amp;D'' or ''ADnD'').&lt;ref name=&quot;D&amp;Dfaq&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dragon 26 Gygax&quot;&gt;Gygax; &quot;From the Sorcerer's Scroll&quot; in ''The Dragon'' #26&lt;/ref&gt; ''AD&amp;D'' 2nd Edition was published in 1989. In 2000, the original version of the game was discontinued and the ''AD&amp;D'' version was renamed simply ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' with the release of its 3rd edition.&lt;ref name=&quot;30Y p.253&quot;&gt;Johnson, ''et al.''; ''30 Years of Adventure'', p. 253&lt;/ref&gt; These rules formed the basis of the [[d20 System]] that is available under the [[Open Game License]] for use by other publishers. ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' version 3.5 was released in June 2003, with a 4th edition in June 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;excitingnews&quot;/&gt;

As of 2006, ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' remained the best-known&lt;ref&gt;According to a 1999 survey in the [[United States]], 6% of 12- to 35-year-olds have played role-playing games. Of those who play regularly, two thirds play ''D&amp;D''.

==Play overview==
[[Image:Dungeons and Dragons game.jpg|right|thumb|200px|A ''D&amp;D'' game session in progress]]
''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' is a structured yet open-ended role-playing game. It is normally played indoors with the participants seated around a tabletop. Typically, each player controls only a single character, which represents an individual in a fictional setting.&lt;ref&gt;Sometimes, if there are not enough players, one may control multiple characters. The ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons Basic Game|Basic Game]]'' suggests, “If there are characters left over, some players may play more than one (but they don't have to)”. (Tweet; ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons Basic Game'').&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Waskul, Lust; &quot;Role-Playing and Playing Roles&quot; in ''Caliber'' 27 (3)&lt;/ref&gt; When working together as a group, these [[player characters]] (PCs) are often described as a ‘party’ of adventurers, with each member often having his or her own areas of specialty that contribute to the success of the whole.&lt;ref&gt;Slavicsek, Baker; ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons for Dummies'' p. 268&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The results of the party's choices and the overall storyline for the game are determined by the [[Dungeon Master]] (DM) according to the rules of the game and the DM's interpretation of those rules.&lt;ref name=&quot;DMG 3.5 p.4&quot;&gt;Cook, Williams, Tweet; ''Dungeon Master's Guide'' v3.5., p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; The DM selects and describes the various [[non-player character]]s (NPCs), the party encounters, the settings in which these interactions occur, and the outcomes of those encounters based on the players' choices and actions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Culture chapter&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Slavicsek, Baker; ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons for Dummies'' p. 293&lt;/ref&gt; Encounters often take the form of battles with '[[monster]]s'&amp;nbsp;– a generic term used in ''D&amp;D'' to describe potentially hostile beings such as animals, aberrant beings or mythical creatures.

[[Image:Dnd v3 5 rulesbooks.png|thumb|200px|Release 3.5 of the three core rulebooks]]
The most recent versions of the game's rules are detailed in three [[Dungeons &amp; Dragons manuals|core rulebooks]]: The ''[[Player's Handbook]]'', the ''[[Dungeon Master's Guide]]'' and the ''[[Monster Manual]]''. A ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons Basic Game|Basic Game]]'' boxed set contains abbreviated rules to help beginners learn the game.&lt;ref&gt;As of 2007 there have been two version of the basic game. Both contained a cut down, introductory version of the ''D&amp;D'' v.3.5 rules, [[miniature figure (gaming)|miniatures]], [[Dice#Standard variations|dice]] and dungeon map tiles with a 1[[Inch|&quot;]] grid (Tweet; ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons Basic Game'' and Slavicsek, Sernett, ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons Basic Game''&lt;/ref&gt;

The only items required to play the game are the rulebooks, a character sheet for each player and a number of [[polyhedral dice]]. The current editions also assume, but do not require, the use of [[miniature figure (gaming)|miniature figures]] or markers on a gridded surface. Earlier editions did not make this assumption.&lt;ref&gt;Wizards of the Coast; What is D&amp;D?&lt;/ref&gt; Many optional accessories are available to enhance the game, such as expansion rulebooks, pre-designed [[Adventure (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|adventures]] and various [[Dungeons &amp; Dragons campaign settings|campaign settings]].&lt;ref&gt;Slavicsek, Baker; ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons for Dummies'' p. 363&lt;/ref&gt;

===Game mechanics===
{{Main|Dungeons &amp; Dragons game mechanics|Character class (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)}}
[[Image:DnD Dice Set.jpg|thumb|250px|left|''D&amp;D'' uses polyhedral dice to resolve random events. These are abbreviated as a 'd' followed by the number of sides. From left, d4, d6, d8, d12, d20 and two d10, both of which are used together to represent a d100, d%, or percentile die.]]

Before the game begins, each player [[character creation|creates]] his or her player character and records the details (described below) on a [[character sheet]]. First, a player determines his or her character's [[Game mechanics (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)#Ability scores|ability scores]],&lt;ref&gt;The original game used 3d6 in the order rolled (Gygax, Arneson; ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons''). Variants have since been included (Gygax; ''Dungeon Masters Guide'', p. 11) and the standard for 3rd edition is &quot;rolling four six-sided dice, ignoring the lowest die, and totaling the other three&quot; (Tweet, Cook, Williams; ''Player's Handbook'' [3.0], p. 4), arranging the results in any order desired.&lt;/ref&gt; which consist of Strength, Constitution, Dexterity, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. Each edition of the game has offered differing methods of determining these statistics; as of 4th Edition, players generally assign their ability scores from a list or use points to &quot;buy&quot; them.&lt;ref&gt;Given is the current standard order for ability scores, with the three physical scores before the three mental scores. Prior to the first edition of AD&amp;D they were ordered: Strength, Intelligence, Wisdom, Constitution, Dexterity, Charisma. In the first edition they were ordered: Strength, Intelligence, Wisdom, Dexterity, Constitution, and Charisma.&lt;/ref&gt; The player then chooses a [[Character race (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|race]] (species) such as Human or Elf, a [[Character class (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|character class]] (occupation) such as Fighter or Wizard, an [[Alignment (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|alignment]] (a moral and ethical outlook which may have a Good or Evil component, a Lawful or Chaotic component, or something in between), and a number of powers, skills and feats to enhance the character's basic abilities.&lt;ref&gt;Heinsoo, Collins, Wyatt; ''Player's Handbook'' p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Additional [[back-story|background history]], usually not covered by specific rules, is often also used to further develop the character.&lt;ref name=&quot;gygax1978&quot;&gt;Gygax; ''Player's Handbook'', p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

During the game, players describe their PC's intended actions, such as punching an opponent or picking a lock, and converse with the DM in character&amp;nbsp;– who then describes the result or response.&lt;ref&gt;Tweet; ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons Basic Game'' p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; Trivial actions, such as picking up a letter or opening an unlocked door, are usually automatically successful. The outcomes of more complex or risky actions are determined by rolling dice.&lt;ref name=&quot;Culture chapter&quot;/&gt; Factors contributing to the outcome include the character's ability scores, skills and the difficulty of the task.&lt;ref&gt;Tweet, Cook, Williams; ''Player's Handbook'' v3.5, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; In circumstances where a character does not have control of an event, such as when a trap or magical effect is triggered or a spell is cast, a [[saving throw]] can be used to determine whether the resulting damage is reduced or avoided.&lt;ref name=&quot;PHB p.136&quot;&gt;Tweet, Cook, Williams; ''Player's Handbook'' v3.5, p. 136&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;“Generally, when you are subject to an unusual or magical attack, you get a saving throw to avoid or reduce the effect.” There is identical language in sections titled ‘Saving Throws’ in (Tweet 2000:119).&lt;/ref&gt; In this case the odds of success are influenced by the character's class, levels and (with the 3rd and later editions) ability scores.&lt;ref name=&quot;PHB p.136&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tweet, Cook, Williams; ''Player's Handbook'' (3.0), pp. 119–120&lt;/ref&gt;

As the game is played, each PC changes over time and generally increases in capability. Characters gain (or sometimes lose) experience, skills&lt;ref&gt;Cook, Williams, Tweet; ''Dungeon Master's Guide'' v3.5., p. 197&lt;/ref&gt; and wealth, and may even alter their alignment&lt;ref&gt;Early editions did not allow or had severe penalties for changing alignment (Gygax; ''Dungeon Masters Guide'', p. 24) but more recent versions are more allowing of change. (Cook, Williams, Tweet; ''Dungeon Master's Guide'' v3.5., p. 134)&lt;/ref&gt; or add additional character classes.&lt;ref&gt;Tweet, Cook, Williams; ''Player's Handbook'' v3.5, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; The key way characters progress is by earning [[experience points]] (XP/EXP), which happens when they defeat an enemy or accomplish a difficult task.&lt;ref&gt;Gygax; ''Dungeon Masters Guide'', p. 84&lt;/ref&gt; Acquiring enough XP allows a PC to advance a [[Level up|level]], which grants the character improved class features, abilities and skills.&lt;ref&gt;Tweet, Cook, Williams; ''Player's Handbook'' v3.5, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; Up through the 3rd edition, XP can also be lost in some circumstances, such as encounters with creatures that drain life energy, or by use of certain magical powers that require payment of an XP cost.&lt;ref&gt;Cook, Williams, Tweet; ''Dungeon Master's Guide'' v3.5., p. 46&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hit point]]s (HP) are a measure of a character's vitality and health and are determined by the class, level and constitution of each character. They can be temporarily lost when a character sustains wounds in combat or otherwise comes to harm, and loss of HP is the most common way for a character to die in the game.&lt;ref&gt;Tweet, Cook, Williams; ''Player's Handbook'' v3.5, p. 145&lt;/ref&gt; Death can also result from the loss of key ability scores&lt;ref&gt;Cook, Williams, Tweet; ''Dungeon Master's Guide'' v3.5., p. 289&lt;/ref&gt; or character levels.&lt;ref&gt;Cook, Williams, Tweet; ''Dungeon Master's Guide'' v3.5., p. 296&lt;/ref&gt; When a PC dies, it is often possible for the dead character to be resurrected through magic, although some penalties may be imposed as a result. If resurrection is not possible or not desired, the player may instead create a new PC to resume playing the game.&lt;ref&gt;Cook, Williams, Tweet; ''Dungeon Master's Guide'' v3.5., p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adventures, campaigns, and modules===
{{Main|Adventure (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)}}

A typical ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' game consists of an 'adventure', which is roughly equivalent to a single story.&lt;ref&gt;Cook, Williams, Tweet; ''Dungeon Master's Guide'' v3.5., p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; The DM can either design an adventure on his or her own, or follow one of the many additional [[Adventure (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|pre-made adventures]] (previously known as &quot;modules&quot;) that have been published throughout the history of ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons''. Published adventures typically include a background story, illustrations, maps and goals for PCs to achieve. Some also include location descriptions and handouts. Although a small adventure entitled '[[Temple of the Frog]]' was included in the ''[[Blackmoor (supplement)|Blackmoor]]'' rules supplement in 1975, the first stand-alone ''D&amp;D'' module published by TSR was 1978’s ''[[Steading of the Hill Giant Chief]]'', written by Gygax.

A linked series of adventures is commonly referred to as a '[[campaign (role-playing games)|campaign]]'.&lt;ref&gt;“A D&amp;D campaign is an organized framework ... to provide a realistic setting for a series of fantastic adventures.” (Schend, Pickens, Warty; ''Rules Cyclopedia'', p. 256)&lt;/ref&gt; The locations where these adventures occur, such as a city, country, planet or an entire [[fictional universe]], are also sometimes called 'campaigns' but are more correctly referred to as 'worlds' or '[[campaign setting]]s'.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;It is important to distinguish between a campaign and a world, since the terms often seem to be used interchangeably ... A world is a fictional place in which a campaign is set. It's also often called a campaign setting.&quot; (Cook, Williams, Tweet; ''Dungeon Master's Guide'' v3.5., p. 129)&lt;/ref&gt; ''D&amp;D'' settings are based in various [[fantasy subgenres]] and feature varying levels of magic and technology.&lt;ref&gt;Williams ; ''Dungeon Master Option: High Level Campaigns'', p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; Popular commercially published [[Dungeons &amp; Dragons campaign settings|campaign settings for ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'']] include [[Greyhawk]], [[Dragonlance]], [[Forgotten Realms]], [[Mystara]], [[Spelljammer]], [[Ravenloft]], [[Dark Sun]], [[Planescape]], [[Birthright (campaign setting)|Birthright]], and [[Eberron]].&lt;ref&gt;Greyhawk, Dragonlance, Forgotten Realms, Mystara, Spelljammer, Ravenloft, Dark Sun and Planescape are the campaign settings given their own chapter in Johnson, ''et al.''; ''30 Years of Adventure''. Eberron was only released in 2004 and, as of 2007, is one of two campaign settings, the other being Forgotten Realms, still actively supported with new releases by Wizards of the Coast.&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, DMs may develop their own fictional worlds to use as campaign settings.

===Miniature figures===
{{Main|Miniature figure (gaming)}}
The [[wargaming|wargames]] from which ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' evolved used [[miniature figure (gaming)|miniature figure]]s to represent combatants. ''D&amp;D'' initially continued the use of miniatures in a fashion similar to its direct precursors. The original ''D&amp;D'' set of 1974 required the use of the ''[[Chainmail (game)|Chainmail]]'' miniatures game for combat resolution.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, ''et al.''; ''30 Years of Adventure'', p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; By the publication of the 1977 game editions, combat was mostly resolved verbally. Thus miniatures were no longer required for game play, although some players continued to use them as a visual reference.&lt;ref&gt;The first ''Dungeon Masters Guide'' gave only a quarter of a page out of a total 240 pages to discussing the option use of miniatures. (Gygax; ''Dungeon Masters Guide'', p. 10)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, numerous companies began to sell miniature figures specifically for ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' and similar games. Licensed miniature manufacturers who produced official figures include [[Grenadier Miniatures]] (1980–1983),&lt;ref&gt;Pope; Grenadier Models&lt;/ref&gt; [[Citadel Miniatures]] (1984–1986),&lt;ref&gt;Scott; Otherworld&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ral Partha]],&lt;ref&gt;Pope; Ral Partha&lt;/ref&gt; and TSR itself.&lt;ref&gt;Pope; TSR&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these miniatures used the 25&amp;nbsp;[[Millimetre|mm]] scale, with the exception of Ral Partha’s 15&amp;nbsp;mm scale miniatures for the 1st edition Battlesystem.&lt;ref&gt;Moore; 15mm Scale Fantasy Figures has a list of the 15&amp;nbsp;mm Ral Parthat Battlesystem figures.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McCuen; 15mm Battlesystem Paladin 1994 has a photographic example of a 15&amp;nbsp;mm Ral Partha Battlesystem figure.&lt;/ref&gt;

Periodically, ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' has returned to its wargaming roots with supplementary rules systems for miniatures-based wargaming. Supplements such as ''[[Battlesystem]]'' (1985 &amp; 1989) and a new edition of ''Chainmail'' (2001)&lt;ref&gt;Academy of Adventure Gaming Arts &amp; Design; List of Winners (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; provided rule systems to handle battles between armies by using miniatures.

''Dungeons &amp; Dragons 3rd Edition'' (2000) assumes the use of miniatures to represent combat situations in play, an aspect of the game that was further emphasized in the v3.5 revision. The ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons Miniatures Game]]'' (2003) is sold as sets of plastic, randomly assorted, pre-painted miniatures, and can be used as either part of a standard ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' game or as a stand-alone [[collectible miniatures game]].&lt;ref&gt;Tweet; What Are D&amp;D Miniatures?&lt;/ref&gt;

==Game history==
===Sources and influences===
{{Main|Sources and influences on the development of Dungeons &amp; Dragons}}

An immediate predecessor of ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' was a set of medieval miniature rules written by Jeff Perren. These were expanded by [[Gary Gygax]], whose additions included a fantasy supplement, before the game was published as ''[[Chainmail (game)|Chainmail]]''. When [[Dave Wesely]] entered the service in 1970, his friend and fellow Napoleonics wargamer [[Dave Arneson]] began a medieval variation of Wesely's Braunstein games, where players control individuals instead of armies.&lt;ref name=&quot;DW3&quot;&gt;Arneson; &quot;My Life and Role Playing&quot; in ''Different Worlds'' #3&lt;/ref&gt; Arneson used ''Chainmail'' to resolve combats.&lt;ref name=&quot;Banshee_Gygax&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Birnbaum|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; As play progressed, Arneson added such innovations as character classes, experience points, level advancement, armor class, and others.&lt;ref name=&quot;DW3&quot;/&gt; Having partnered previously with Gygax on ''[[Don't Give Up the Ship!]]'', Arneson introduced Gygax to his [[Blackmoor]] game and the two then collaborated on developing &quot;The Fantasy Game&quot;, the role-playing game (RPG) that became ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'', with the final writing and preparation of the text being done by Gygax.&lt;ref name=&quot;D&amp;Dfaq&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wired&quot;&gt;Kushner; Dungeon Master: The Life and Legacy of Gary Gygax&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;&gt;Wizards of the Coast; The History of TSR&lt;/ref&gt;

Many ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' elements also appear in hobbies of the mid-to-late 20th century (though these elements also existed previously). Character-based role playing, for example, can be seen in [[improvisational theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;Grigg; Albert Goes Narrative Contracting&lt;/ref&gt; Game-world simulations were well developed in [[wargaming]]. Fantasy milieus specifically designed for gaming could be seen in [[Glorantha]]’s board games among others.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schick 17-34&quot;&gt;Schick; ''Heroic Worlds'', pp. 17–34&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, however, ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' represents a unique blending of these elements.

The theme of ''D&amp;D'' was influenced by [[mythology]], [[pulp magazine|pulp fiction]], and contemporary fantasy authors of the 1960s and 1970s. The presence of [[halflings]], [[Elf (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|elves]], [[Dwarf (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|dwarves]], [[Half-elf (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|half-elves]], [[Orc (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|orcs]], [[Dragon (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|dragons]], and the like, often draw comparisons to the work of [[Tolkien|J.R.R. Tolkien]]. Gygax maintained that he was influenced very little by ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' (although the owners of that work’s copyright forced the name changes of hobbit to 'halfling', ent to 'treant', and balrog to 'Type VI demon [balor]'), stating that he included these elements as a marketing move to draw on the popularity of the work.&lt;ref&gt;Kuntz; &quot;Tolkien in Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; in ''Dragon'' #13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dragon95&quot;&gt;Gygax; &quot;On the Influence of J.R.R. Tolkien on the D&amp;D and AD&amp;D games&quot; in ''Dragon'' #95&lt;/ref&gt;

The magic system, in which wizards memorize spells that are used up once cast (and must be re-memorized the next day), was heavily influenced by the ''[[Dying Earth series|Dying Earth]]'' stories and novels of [[Jack Vance]].&lt;ref&gt;Gygax;
&quot;The Dungeons and Dragons Magic System&quot; in ''The Strategic Review'', Vol. 2, No. 2&lt;/ref&gt; The original alignment system (which grouped all players and creatures into ‘Law’, ‘Neutrality’ and ‘Chaos’) was derived from the novel ''[[Three Hearts and Three Lions]]'' by [[Poul Anderson]].&lt;ref name=&quot;lit_source&quot;/&gt; A troll described in this work also influenced the ''D&amp;D'' definition of that monster.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dragon95&quot;/&gt;

Other influences include the works of [[Robert E. Howard]], [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]], [[A. Merritt]], [[H. P. Lovecraft]], [[Fritz Leiber]], [[L. Sprague de Camp]], [[Fletcher Pratt]], [[Roger Zelazny]], and [[Michael Moorcock]].&lt;ref&gt;The first seven listed here are the “most immediate influences”. (Gygax; ''Dungeon Masters Guide'', p. 224)&lt;/ref&gt; Monsters, spells, and magic items used in the game have been inspired by hundreds of individual works ranging from [[Van vogt|A. E. van Vogt’s]] “Black Destroyer”, [[Coeurl]] (the [[Displacer Beast]]), [[Lewis Carroll]]’s “[[Jabberwocky]]” ([[vorpal]] sword) to the [[Book of Genesis]] (the clerical spell ‘Blade Barrier’ was inspired by the “flaming sword which turned every way” at the gates of [[Garden of Eden|Eden]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;lit_source&quot;&gt;DeVarque; Literary Sources of D&amp;D&lt;/ref&gt;

===Edition history===
{{Main|Editions of Dungeons &amp; Dragons}}

''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' has gone through several revisions. Parallel versions and inconsistent naming practices can make it difficult to distinguish between the different editions.

[[Image:D&amp;d Box1st.jpg|thumb|left|175px|The original ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' set.]]
The [[Dungeons &amp; Dragons (1974)|original ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'']], now referred to as OD&amp;D,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Carroll | first = Bart | last2 = Winter | first2 = Steve | date = 2009-02-06 | title = Name Level | periodical = [[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]] | publisher = [[Wizards of the Coast]] | publication-date = 2009-02-06 | issue = 372 | url = http://www.wizards.com/DnD/Article.aspx?x=dnd/4alum/20090206 | ref = harv | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; was a small box set of three booklets published in 1974. It was amateurish in production and written from a perspective that assumed the reader was familiar with wargaming. Nevertheless it grew rapidly in popularity, first among wargamers and then expanding to a more general audience of college and high school students. Roughly 1,000 copies of the game were sold in the first year followed by 4,000 in 1975, with sales increasing thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 | title=Warlocks and Warpdrive: contemporary fantasy entertainments with interactive and virtual environments
 | page=34 | publisher=McFarland | isbn=0-7864-0634-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This first set went through many printings and was supplemented with several official additions, such as the original [[Greyhawk (supplement)|Greyhawk]] and [[Blackmoor (supplement)|Blackmoor]] supplements (both 1975),&lt;ref&gt;Schick; ''Heroic Worlds'', pp. 132-153&lt;/ref&gt; as well as magazine articles in TSR’s official publications and countless [[fanzine]]s.

====Two-pronged strategy====
In 1977, TSR created the first element of a two-pronged strategy that would divide the ''D&amp;D'' game for over two decades. A ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons Basic Set]]'' boxed edition was introduced&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;/&gt; that cleaned up the presentation of the essential rules, made the system understandable to the general public, and was sold in a package that could be stocked in toy stores. In 1978, ''Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' (''AD&amp;D'') was published,&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot; /&gt; which brought together the various published rules, options and corrections, then expanded them into a definitive, unified game for hobbyist gamers. The basic set directed players who exhausted the possibilities of that game to switch to the advanced rules.

Unfortunately, almost from its inception, differences of design philosophy caused this dual marketing approach to go awry. Gygax, who wrote the advanced game, wanted an expansive game with rulings on any conceivable situation which might come up during play. J. Eric Holmes, the editor of the basic game, preferred a lighter tone with more room for personal improvisation. As a result, the basic game included many rules and concepts which contradicted comparable ones in the advanced game. Confusing matters further, the original ''D&amp;D'' boxed set remained in publication until 1979, since it remained a healthy seller for TSR.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schick 17-34&quot; /&gt;

''Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' was designed to create a tighter, more structured game system than the loose framework of the original game.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dragon 26 Gygax&quot;/&gt; While seen by many as a revision of the original ''D&amp;D'',&lt;ref name=&quot;30Y p.253&quot;/&gt; ''AD&amp;D'' was at the time declared to be &quot;neither an expansion nor a revision of the old game, it is a new game&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dragon 26 Gygax&quot;/&gt; The ''AD&amp;D'' game was not intended to be directly compatible with ''D&amp;D'' and it required some conversion to play between the rule sets.&lt;ref&gt;Schend, Pickens, Warty; ''Rules Cyclopedia'', p. 291&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''Advanced'' described the more complex rules and did not imply &quot;for higher-level gaming abilities&quot;. Between 1977 and 1979, three hardcover rulebooks, commonly referred to as the &quot;core rulebooks&quot;, were released: the ''[[Player's Handbook|Player’s Handbook]]'' (PHB), the ''[[Dungeon Master's Guide|Dungeon Master’s Guide]]'' (DMG), and the ''[[Monster Manual]]'' (MM). Several supplementary books were published throughout the 1980s, notably ''[[Unearthed Arcana]]'' (1985) that included a large number of new rules.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;/&gt;

====Revised editions====
In the 1980s, the rules for ''Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' and &quot;basic&quot; ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' remained separate, each developing along different paths.

In 1981, the &quot;basic&quot; version of ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' was revised by Tom Moldvay and split into several versions. This game was promoted as a continuation of the original ''D&amp;D'' tone, whereas ''AD&amp;D'' was promoted as advancement of the mechanics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dragon 26 Gygax&quot;/&gt; Although simpler overall than the ''Advanced'' game, it included rules for some situations not covered in ''AD&amp;D''. There were five sets: ''Basic'' (1977, revised in 1981 and again in 1983), ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons Expert Set|Expert]]'' (1981, revised in 1983), ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons Companion Set|Companion]]'' (1983), ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons Master Rules|Master]]'' (1985), and ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons Immortals Rules|Immortals]]'' (1986, revised in 1991). Each set covered game play for more powerful characters than the previous.&lt;ref&gt;Gygax; &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons: What Is It and Where Is It Going&quot; in ''The Dragon'' #21&lt;/ref&gt; The first four sets were later compiled as a single hardcover book, the ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons Rules Cyclopedia]]'' (1991).

[[Image:DungeonMasterGuide4Cover.jpg|thumbnail|right|200px|First edition ''Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons Dungeon Masters Guide''.]]

''Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2nd Edition'', sometimes referred to as ''AD&amp;D2'' or ''2nd Ed'', was published in 1989,&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;/&gt; again as three core rulebooks; the primary designer was [[David &quot;Zeb&quot; Cook]]. The ''Monster Manual'' was replaced by the ''[[Monstrous Compendium]]'', a loose-leaf binder that was subsequently replaced by the hardcover ''[[Monstrous Manual]]'' in 1993. In 1995, the core rulebooks were slightly revised, although still referred to by TSR as the 2nd Edition,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;This is not ''AD&amp;D'' 3rd edition&quot; Winter, Steven (in the forward to Cook; ''Player's Handbook'').&lt;/ref&gt; and a series of ''Player’s Option'' manuals were released as optional core rulebooks.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;/&gt;

The release of ''AD&amp;D2'' deliberately excluded some aspects of the game that had attracted negative publicity. References to demons and devils, sexually suggestive artwork, and playable, evil-aligned character types&amp;nbsp;– such as assassins and half-orcs&amp;nbsp;– were removed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dragon 154&quot;&gt;Ward; &quot;The Games Wizards: Angry Mothers From Heck (And what we do about them)&quot; in ''Dragon'' #154&lt;/ref&gt; The edition moved away from a theme of 1960s and 1970s &quot;sword and sorcery&quot; fantasy fiction to a mixture of medieval history and mythology.&lt;ref&gt;Cook; ''Player's Handbook'' (1989), pp. 25-41&lt;/ref&gt; The rules underwent minor changes, including the addition of non-weapon proficiencies&amp;nbsp;– skill-like abilities that originally appeared in 1st Edition supplements. The game's magic spells were divided into schools and spheres.&lt;ref name=&quot;D&amp;Dfaq&quot;/&gt; A major difference was the promotion of various game settings beyond that of traditional fantasy. This included blending fantasy with other genres, such as horror ([[Ravenloft]]), science fiction ([[Spelljammer]]), and apocalyptic ([[Dark Sun]]), as well as alternative historical and non-European mythological settings.&lt;ref&gt;Pryor, Herring, Tweet, Richie; ''[[Creative Campaigning]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

====Wizards of the Coast====
In 1997, a near-bankrupt TSR was purchased by [[Wizards of the Coast]]. Following three years of development, ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons 3rd Edition'' was released in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;After ... the idea of acquiring TSR began to swim in my mind it took me maybe thirty seconds to decide, We’ve got to do a third edition of Dungeons &amp; Dragons.&quot; ([[Peter Adkison|Adkison, Peter]] in Johnson, ''et al.''; ''30 Years of Adventure'', p. 250).&lt;/ref&gt; This game is referred to as ''D&amp;D3'' or ''3E'' and is not to be confused with the 1983 edition of the basic ''D&amp;D'' game, though the Player's Handbook and Dungeon Master's Guides of this edition simply state &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons.&quot; The new release folded the Basic and Advanced lines back into a single unified game. It was the largest revision of the ''D&amp;D'' rules to date, and also served as the basis for a multi-genre role-playing system designed around 20-sided dice, called the [[d20 System]].&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, ''et al.''; ''30 Years of Adventure'', p. 273&lt;/ref&gt; The 3rd Edition rules were designed to be internally consistent and less restrictive than previous editions of the game, allowing players more flexibility to create the characters they wanted to play.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, ''et al.''; ''30 Years of Adventure'', pp. 255-263&lt;/ref&gt; Skills and feats were introduced into the core rules to encourage further customization of characters.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Countdown to 3rd Edition: Feats and Fighters&quot; in ''Dragon'' #270&lt;/ref&gt; The new rules also standardized the mechanics of action resolution and combat.&lt;ref name=&quot;PHB p.4&quot;&gt;Tweet, Cook, Williams; ''Player's Handbook'' v3.5, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons v.3.5'', also known as Revised 3rd Edition or ''D&amp;D3.5'', was released as a revision of the 3rd Edition rules. This release incorporated hundreds of rule changes, mostly minor, and expanded the core rulebooks.&lt;ref name=&quot;PHB p.4&quot;/&gt;

In early 2005, Wizards of the Coast's R&amp;D team started to develop ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' 4th Edition, prompted mainly by the feedback obtained from the ''D&amp;D'' playing community and a desire to make the game faster, more intuitive, and with a better play experience than under the 3rd Edition. The new game was developed through a number of design phases spanning from May 2005 until its release.&lt;ref&gt;Carter, ''et al.''; ''Wizards presents races and classes'', pp. 6-9&lt;/ref&gt;

''Dungeons &amp; Dragons 4th Edition'' was announced at [[Gen Con]] in August 2007, and the initial three core books were released June 6, 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;excitingnews&quot;&gt;Slavicsek; Ampersand: Exciting News!&lt;/ref&gt; 4th Edition streamlined the game into a simplified form and introduced numerous rules changes. Many character abilities were restructured into &quot;Powers&quot;. These altered the spell-using classes by adding abilities that could be used at will, per encounter, or per day. Likewise, non-magic-using classes were provided with parallel sets of options. Wizards of the Coast is releasing other supplementary material virtually through their website,&lt;ref name=&quot;4-ward at Gen Con&quot;&gt;Wizards of the Coast; Dungeons &amp; Dragons Flashes 4-ward at Gen Con&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wizards of the Coast; Wizards of the Coast at Gen Con!&lt;/ref&gt; including player character and monster building programs.&lt;ref name=&quot;svensson&quot;/&gt;

===Acclaim and influence===
Beginning with a [[French language]] edition in 1982, ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' has been translated into many languages beyond the original English.&lt;ref name=&quot;D&amp;Dfaq&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;/&gt; By 2004, consumers had spent more than US$1&amp;nbsp;billion on ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' products and the game had been played by more than 20&amp;nbsp;million people.&lt;ref name=&quot;waters&quot;/&gt; As many as 6&amp;nbsp;million people played the game in 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;svensson&quot;&gt;Svensson; Dungeons &amp; Dragons reborn&lt;/ref&gt;

The various editions of ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' have won many [[Origins Award]]s, including ''All Time Best Roleplaying Rules of 1977'', ''Best Roleplaying Rules of 1989'', and ''Best Roleplaying Game of 2000'' for the three flagship editions of the game.&lt;ref&gt;Academy of Adventure Gaming Arts &amp; Design; Archive of List of Origins Award Winners&lt;/ref&gt; Both ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' and ''Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' are Origins Hall of Fame Games inductees as they were deemed sufficiently distinct to merit separate inclusion on different occasions.&lt;ref&gt;Academy of Adventure Gaming Arts and Design; Hall of Fame&lt;/ref&gt; The independent ''[[Games (magazine)|Games]]'' magazine placed ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' on their ''Games 100'' list from 1980 through 1983, then entered the game into the magazine’s Hall of Fame in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;Schick; ''Heroic Worlds'', pp. 414-418&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Games Magazine Online; Hall of Fame&lt;/ref&gt;

''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' was the first modern role-playing game and it established many of the conventions that have dominated the genre.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Although we have come a long way since D&amp;D, the essential concept is still the same, and is one that will endure.&quot; (Darlington; &quot;A History of Role-Playing Part IX&quot;).&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly notable are the use of dice as a [[game mechanic]], [[character sheet|character record sheets]], use of [[Statistic (role-playing games)|numerical attributes]] and gamemaster-centered group dynamics.&lt;ref&gt;Rilstone; Role-Playing Games: An Overview&lt;/ref&gt; Within months of ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons''’s release, new role-playing game writers and publishers began releasing their own role-playing games, with most of these being in the fantasy genre. Some of the earliest other role-playing games inspired by ''D&amp;D'' include ''[[Tunnels &amp; Trolls]]'' (1975),&lt;ref&gt;Schick; Heroic Worlds, pp. 223–244&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Tékumel|Empire of the Petal Throne]]'' (1975), and ''[[Chivalry &amp; Sorcery]]'' (1976).&lt;ref&gt;Fine; ''Shared Fantasy'', pp. 16-19&lt;/ref&gt;

The role-playing movement initiated by ''D&amp;D'' would lead to release of the science fiction game ''[[Traveller (roleplaying game)|Traveller]]'' (1977) and fantasy game ''[[RuneQuest]]'' (1978), and subsequent game systems such as [[Chaosium]]’s ''[[Call of Cthulhu (role-playing game)|Call of Cthulhu]]'' (1981), ''[[Champions (roleplaying game)|Champions]]'' (1982), ''[[GURPS]]'' (1986),&lt;ref&gt;Darlington; A History of Role-Playing Part V&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Vampire: The Masquerade]]'' (1991).&lt;ref name=&quot;Schick 17-34&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Darlington; A History of Role-Playing Part VIII&lt;/ref&gt; ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' and the games it influenced fed back into the genre’s origin&amp;nbsp;– miniatures wargames&amp;nbsp;– with combat strategy games like ''[[Warhammer Fantasy Battles]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Grady; In Genre&lt;/ref&gt; ''D&amp;D'' also had a large impact on modern [[video game]]s.&lt;ref&gt;PC Gamer; How Dungeons &amp; Dragons shaped the modern videogame&lt;/ref&gt;

Director [[Jon Favreau]] credits ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' with giving him &quot;...a really strong background in imagination, storytelling, understanding how to create tone and a sense of balance.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Boucher; Jon Favreau is the action figure behind 'Iron Man'.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Licensing===
{{See|Variant Dungeons &amp; Dragons games}}

Early in the game’s history, TSR took no action against small publishers' production of ''D&amp;D'' compatible material. This attitude changed in the mid 1980s when TSR took legal action to try to prevent others from publishing compatible material. This angered many fans and led to resentment by the other gaming companies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schick 17-34&quot; /&gt; Although TSR took legal action against several publishers in an attempt to restrict third-party usage, it never brought any court cases to completion, instead settling out of court in every instance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 | title=Games &amp; The Law, Part Seven: The D&amp;D Dilemma
 | accessdate=July 7, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; TSR itself also ran afoul of intellectual property law in several cases.&lt;ref&gt;Copyright conflicts with the [[Tolkien Estate]] lead to removal of references to [[Hobbit]]s, [[Ent]]s and others. (Hallford, Hallford; ''Swords &amp; Circuitry'')&lt;/ref&gt;

With the launch of ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons''’s [[Editions of Dungeons &amp; Dragons|3rd Edition]], Wizards of the Coast made the [[d20 System]] available under the [[Open Game License]] (OGL) and [[D20 System#Trademark license|d20 trademark license]]. Under these licenses, authors are free to use the d20 System when writing games and game supplements.&lt;ref&gt;Wizards of the Coast; The d20 System&lt;/ref&gt; The OGL and d20 Trademark License also made possible new games, some based on licensed products like ''[[Star Wars Roleplaying Game (Wizards of the Coast)|Star Wars]]'', and also new versions of older games, such as ''[[Call of Cthulhu (role-playing game)#d20 Call of Cthulhu|Call of Cthulhu]]''.

During the 2000s, there has been a trend towards recreating older editions of ''D&amp;D''. [[Necromancer Games]], with its slogan &quot;Third Edition Rules, First Edition Feel&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Necromancer Games; D20 Products with 3rd Edition Rules, 1st Edition Feel&lt;/ref&gt; and Goodman Games ''Dungeon Crawl Classics'' range&lt;ref&gt;Goodman Games; Dungeon Crawl Classics&lt;/ref&gt; are both examples of this in material for d20 System. Other companies have created complete game systems based on earlier editions of ''D&amp;D''. An example is ''[[HackMaster]]'' (2001) by [[Kenzer and Company]], a licensed, non-OGL, semi-satirical follow-on to 1st and 2nd Edition.&lt;ref&gt;Thorn; Review of Hackmaster 4th Edition&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Castles &amp; Crusades]]'' (2005), by [[Troll Lord Games]], is a reimagining of early editions by streamlining rules from OGL&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Castles &amp; Crusades is a fantasy RPG, clearly based upon the first edition of AD&amp;D but with streamlined d20-like rules.&quot; (Mythmere; Castles &amp; Crusades Players Handbook (4.6 stars))&lt;/ref&gt; that was supported by Gary Gygax prior to his death.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Gygax was writing an entire line of ''Castle Zagyg'' products for ''[[Castles &amp; Crusades]]''. (Troll Lord games; Castle Zagyg Product Page)&lt;/ref&gt;

With the release of the [[Editions of Dungeons &amp; Dragons#Dungeons &amp; Dragons 4th edition|fourth edition]], Wizards of the Coast has introduced its [[Game System License]], which represents a significant restriction compared to the very open policies embodied by the OGL. In part as a response to this, some publishers (such as [[Paizo Publishing]] with its ''[[Pathfinder Roleplaying Game]]'') who previously produced materials in support of the ''D&amp;D'' product line, have decided to continue supporting the 3rd Edition rules, thereby competing directly with Wizards of the Coast.&lt;ref&gt;Paizo Publishing; Paizo Publishing Announces the Pathfinder RPG&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pramas; Green Ronin and Fourth Edition D&amp;D&lt;/ref&gt; Others, such as [[Kenzer &amp; Company]], are returning to the practice of publishing unlicensed supplements and arguing that copyright law does not allow Wizards of the Coast to restrict third-party usage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Controversy and notoriety===
{{Main|Dungeons &amp; Dragons controversies}}

At various times in its history, ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' has received negative publicity, in particular from some [[Christian]] groups, for alleged promotion of such practices as [[Satanism#Theistic Satanism|devil worship]], [[witchcraft]], suicide, and murder, and for naked breasts in drawings of female humanoids in the original ''AD&amp;D'' manuals (mainly monsters such as [[Harpy (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|Harpies]], [[Succubus (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|Succubi]], and so on.).&lt;ref name=&quot;Moral Panic&quot;&gt;Waldron; Role-Playing Games and the Christian Right&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;attacks&quot;&gt;Cardwell; &quot;The Attacks on Role-Playing Games&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; These controversies led TSR to remove many potentially controversial references and artwork when releasing the 2nd Edition of ''AD&amp;D''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dragon 154&quot;/&gt; Many of these references, including the use of the names &quot;[[Devil (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|devils]]&quot; and &quot;[[Demon (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|demons]]&quot;, were reintroduced in the 3rd edition.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Tweet, Cook; ''Monster Manual'', pp. 41,47)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[moral panic]] over the game also led to problems for fans of ''D&amp;D'' who faced social ostracism, unfair treatment, and false association with the occult and [[Satanism]], regardless of an individual fan's actual religious affiliation and beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Gagne; Moral Panics Over Youth Culture and Video Games&lt;/ref&gt;

''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' has also been the subject of rumors regarding players having difficulty separating fantasy from reality, even leading to [[psychotic]] episodes.&lt;ref&gt;Darlington; A History of Role-Playing Part IV&lt;/ref&gt; The most notable of these was the saga of [[James Dallas Egbert III]],&lt;ref&gt;Hately; The Disappearance of James Dallas Egbert III (Part I)&lt;/ref&gt; the facts of which were fictionalized in the novel ''[[Mazes and Monsters (novel)|Mazes and Monsters]]'' and later made into a [[Mazes and Monsters|TV movie]].&lt;ref name=&quot;attacks&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor; TV: 'Mazes and Monsters,' Fantasy&lt;/ref&gt; The game was also blamed for some of the actions of [[Chris Pritchard]], who was convicted in 1990 of murdering his stepfather. Research by various psychologists,&lt;ref&gt;Svitavsky; &quot;Geek Culture&quot; in ''The Bulletin of Bibliography'' '''58''' 2&lt;/ref&gt; the first being that of Armando Simon, have concluded that no harmful effects are related to the playing of ''D&amp;D''.&lt;ref&gt;Armando; &quot;Emotional Stability Pertaining to Dungeons and Dragons&quot; in ''Psychology in the Schools'' '''84''' (4)&lt;/ref&gt;

The game’s commercial success was a factor that led to [[lawsuits]] regarding distribution of [[royalties]] between original creators Gygax and Arneson.&lt;ref&gt;Judges Guild; &quot;Interview with Dave Arneson&quot; in ''Pegasus'' #1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rausch; Dave Arneson Interview&lt;/ref&gt; Gygax later became embroiled in a political struggle for control of TSR which culminated in a court battle and Gygax’s decision to sell his ownership interest in the company in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;Gygax; Gygax FAQ&lt;/ref&gt;

''D&amp;D'' grew in popularity through the late 1970s and 1980s. Numerous games, films, and cultural references based on ''D&amp;D'' or ''D&amp;D''-like fantasies, characters or adventures have been ubiquitous since the end of the 1970s. ''D&amp;D'' players are (sometimes pejoratively) portrayed as the epitome of [[geek]]dom,&lt;ref&gt;Curell; Dungeons &amp; Dragons-30 Years and Going Strong&lt;/ref&gt; and have become the basis of much geek and gamer humor and satire.&lt;ref&gt;Onion; &quot;Bill Gates Grants Self 18 Dexterity, 20 Charisma&quot; in ''The Onion'' '''31''' (21)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Keler, Rogers; ''Anthology of Interest I''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Famous D&amp;D players]] include professional basketball player [[Tim Duncan]], comedian [[Stephen Colbert]], and actors [[Vin Diesel]] and [[Robin Williams]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

{{Criminal procedure (trial)}}
'''Double jeopardy''' is a [[procedural defense]] that forbids a [[defendant]] from being [[Trial|tried]] again on the same, or similar charges following a legitimate acquittal or conviction. At [[common law]] a defendant may plead '''''autrefois acquit''''' or '''''autrefois convict''''' (a [[peremptory plea]]), meaning the defendant has been acquitted or convicted of the same offense.&lt;ref name=&quot;Benét1864p97&quot;&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If this issue is raised, evidence will be placed before the court, which will normally rule as a preliminary matter whether the plea is substantiated, and if it so finds, the projected trial will be prevented from proceeding. In many countries the guarantee against being &quot;twice put in jeopardy&quot; is a [[constitution]]al right; these include [[Canada]], [[India]], [[Mexico]], and the [[United States]]. In other countries, the protection is afforded by [[Statutory law|statute law]].{{#Tag:Ref|e.g., in [[Western Australia]] protection against double jeopardy is provided by section 17 of the Criminal Code Act Compilation Act 1913.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slp.wa.gov.au/pco/prod/FileStore.nsf/Documents/MRDocument:20273P/$FILE/CrimCdActCompilationAct1913_16-a0-00.pdf?OpenElement Criminal Code Act Compilation Act 1913] (see p. 47; p. 51 of the PDF), [http://www.slp.wa.gov.au State Law Publisher of Western Australia].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Australia==
In contrast to other common law nations, Australian double jeopardy law has been held to extend to the prevention of prosecution for [[perjury]] following a previous acquittal where a finding of perjury would controvert the previous acquittal. This was confirmed in the case of ''[[R v Carroll]]'', where the police found new evidence convincingly disproving Carroll's sworn [[alibi]] two decades after he had been acquitted of murder charges in the death of [[Ipswich, Queensland|Ipswich]] child Deidre Kennedy, and successfully prosecuted him for perjury. Public outcry following the overturning of his conviction (for perjury) by the [[High Court of Australia|High Court]] has led to widespread calls for reform of the law along the lines of the UK legislation.

In December 2006, [[Premiers of New South Wales|New South Wales Premier]] [[Morris Iemma]] introduced legislation to scrap substantial parts of the double jeopardy law in that state. Retrials of serious cases with a minimum sentence of 20 years or more are now possible, even when the original trial preceded the 2006 reform.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/worldtoday/content/2006/s1735450.htm NSW seeks to scrap double jeopardy principle], The World Today.&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 October 2006, the NSW Parliament passed legislation abolishing the rule against double jeopardy in cases where:
*someone acquitted of a &quot;life sentence offence&quot; (murder, violent gang rapes, large commercial supply or production of illegal drugs) where there is &quot;fresh and compelling&quot; evidence of guilt;
*someone acquitted of a &quot;15 years or more sentence offence&quot; where the acquittal was tainted (by perjury, bribery or perversion of the course of justice); and,
*someone acquitted in a [[Bench trial|judge-only trial]] or where a judge [[Directed verdict|directed the jury]] to acquit.&lt;ref name=djUofNSW&gt;[http://www.nswccl.org.au/unswccl/issues/double%20jeopardy%20nsw.php NSW abolishes double jeopardy], University of NSW.&lt;/ref&gt; This largely grew out of the case of Raymond John Carroll.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nswccl.org.au/unswccl/issues/double%20jeopardy.php#carroll Double Jeopardy and the Carroll Case], University of NSW.&lt;/ref&gt;

South Australia currently is also in the process of reforming its laws which will see the principle of double jeopardy abolished for serious indictable offences.

On 18 October 2007, Queensland modified its double jeopardy laws to allow a retrial where fresh and compelling evidence becomes available after an acquittal for murder or a 'tainted acquittal' for a crime carrying a 25-year or more sentence. A 'tainted acquittal' requires a conviction for an administration of justice offence, such as perjury, that led to the original acquittal. Unlike reforms in the United Kingdom and New South Wales, this law does not have a retrospective effect, making its introduction less than fully appreciated by those who, over the years, have been advocating reform.

According to the University of New South Wales, the federal government is pushing hard for ‘reform’ of double jeopardy throughout Australia.&lt;ref name=djUofNSW /&gt;

==Canada==
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}
The [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] includes provisions such as [[Section Eleven of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 11(h)]] prohibiting double jeopardy. But often this prohibition applies only after the trial is finally concluded. [[Law of Canada|Canadian law]] allows the prosecution to appeal from an acquittal. If the acquittal is thrown out, the new trial is not considered to be double jeopardy because the first trial and its judgment would have been annulled. In rare circumstances, a court of appeal might also substitute a conviction for an acquittal. This is not considered to be double jeopardy either - in this case the appeal and subsequent conviction are deemed to be a continuation of the original trial.

For an appeal from an acquittal to be successful, the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] requires that the Crown show an error in law was made during the trial and that the error contributed to the verdict. It has been suggested that this test is unfairly beneficial to the prosecution. For instance, [[Martin Friedland|Martin L Friedland]], in his book ''My Life in Crime and Other Academic Adventures'', contends that the rule should be changed so that a retrial is granted only when the error is shown to be ''responsible'' for the verdict, not just one of many factors.

A notable example of this is the case of [[David Ahenakew]] or Colby Campbell, who were tried a second time after being acquitted.

==European Convention on Human Rights==
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}
[[Image:09CFREU-Article50.jpg|right|thumb|350px|Article 50 of the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union]] protects against double jeopardy.]]
All members of the [[Council of Europe]] (which includes nearly all European countries, and every member of the [[European Union]]) have signed the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], which protects against double jeopardy. The optional Seventh Protocol to the Convention, Article Four, says:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
No one shall be liable to be tried or punished again in criminal proceedings under the jurisdiction of the same State for an [[Offence (law)|offence]] for which he has already been finally [[acquittal|acquitted]] or [[Conviction|convicted]] in accordance with the law and penal procedure of that State.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Member states may, however, implement legislation which allows reopening of a case in the event that new evidence is found or if there was a fundamental defect in the previous proceedings.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The provisions of the preceding paragraph shall not prevent the reopening of the case in accordance with the law and penal procedure of the State concerned, if there is evidence of new or newly discovered facts, or if there has been a fundamental defect in the previous proceedings, which could affect the outcome of the case.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This optional protocol has been ratified by all EU states except five (namely [[Belgium]], [[Germany]], [[Spain]], the [[Netherlands]], and [[United Kingdom]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/Commun/ChercheSig.asp?NT=117&amp;CM=8&amp;DF=4/11/2007&amp;CL=ENG Protocol No. 7 to the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms], Council of Europe.&lt;/ref&gt; In those member states, national rules governing double jeopardy may or may not comply with the provision cited above.

In many European countries the prosecution may appeal an acquittal to a higher court (similar to the provisions of Canadian law) – this is not counted as double jeopardy but as a continuation of the same trial. This is allowed by the European Convention on Human Rights – note the word ''finally'' in the above quote.

==France==
Once all appeals have been exhausted on a case, the judgment is final and the action of the prosecution is closed (code of penal procedure, art. 6), except if the final ruling was [[forgery|forged]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCodeArticle.do?idArticle=LEGIARTI000006574827&amp;cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006071154 Code of penal procedure, article 6]&lt;/ref&gt; Prosecution for an already judged crime is impossible even though new incriminating evidence has been found. However, a person who has been convicted may request another trial on grounds of new exculpating evidence through a procedure known as ''révision''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCode.do?idSectionTA=LEGISCTA000006138099&amp;cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006071154 Code of penal procedure, articles 622-626]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Germany==
In [[Germany]], the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany]] provides protection against double jeopardy:

{{quotation|Nobody shall be punished multiple times for the same crime on the base of general criminal law.|Art. 103 (3) GG}}
Based on pre-constitutional case law, the clause is constructed to also protect against double jeopardy in the case of an acquittal. However, it is not considered double jeopardy if the prosecution appeals an acquittal.

The rule applies to the whole &quot;historical event, which is usually considered a single historical course of actions the separation of which would seem unnatural&quot;. This is true even if new facts occur that indicate other and/or much serious crimes.

The Penal Procedural Code (Strafprozessordnung - StPO) provides some exceptions to the double jeopardy rule:

{{quotation|A retrial not in favour of the defendant is permissible after a final judgment,
#if a document that was considered authentic during the trial was actually not authentic or forged,
#if a witness or authorised expert wilfully or negligently made a wrong deposition or willfully gave a wrong simple testimony,
#if a professional or lay judge, who made the decision, had committed a crime by violating his or her duties as a judge in the case
#if an acquitted defendant makes a credible confession in court or out of court.|§ 362 StPO}}

In the case of an order of summary punishment (Strafbefehl), which can be issued by the court without a trial for lesser misdemeanours (German: Vergehen), there is a further exception:
{{quotation|A retrial not in favour of the defendant is also permissible if the defendant has been convicted in a final order of summary punishment and new facts or evidence have been brought forward, which establish grounds for a conviction of a felony by themselves or in combination with earlier evidence.|§ 373a StPO}}
A felony (German: Verbrechen) is defined as a crime which has a usual minimum sanction of one year of imprisonment.

==India==
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}
A partial protection against double jeopardy is a [[Fundamental Rights in India|Fundamental Right]] guaranteed under Article 20 (3) of the [[Constitution of India]]. This states that &quot;&quot;No person shall be prosecuted and punished for the same offence more than once&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://indiacode.nic.in/coiweb/fullact1.asp?tfnm=00%2023 Article 20, Section 2] of the [http://indiacode.nic.in/coiweb/coifiles/part.htm Constitution of India] reads, &quot;No person shall be prosecuted and punished for the same offence more than once.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; This provision enshrines the concept of ''autrefois convict'', that no convicted of an offence can be tried or punished a second time. However it does not extend to ''autrefois acquit'', and so if a person is acquited of a crime he can be retried.

==International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights==

The 72 [[signatories]] and 166 [[parties]] to the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] recognise this rule, under Article 14 (7): No one shall be liable to be tried or punished again for an offence for which he has already been finally [[convicted]] or [[acquitted]] in accordance with the law and penal procedure of each country.

==Japan==
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}
The [[Constitution of Japan]] states in Article 39 that
:No person shall be held criminally liable for an act which was lawful at the time it was committed, or of which he has been acquitted, nor shall he be placed in double jeopardy.

However, in practice, if someone is acquitted in a lower District Court, then the prosecutor can appeal to the High Court, and then to the Supreme Court. Only the acquittal in the Supreme Court is the final acquittal which prevents any further retrial. This process sometimes takes decades.

==Netherlands==
In the Netherlands, the state prosecution can appeal against a not-guilty verdict at the bench. New evidence can be brought to bear during a retrial at a district court. Thus one can be tried twice for the same alleged crime. If one is convicted at the district court, the defence can make an appeal on procedural grounds to the supreme court. The supreme court might admit this complaint, and the case will be reopened yet again, at another district court. Again, new evidence might be introduced by the prosecution.

According to Dutch legal experts Crombag, Wagenaar, van Koppen, the Dutch system contravenes the provisions of the European Human Rights convention, in the imbalance between the power of the prosecution service and the defence.

==Pakistan==
{{Expand section|date=April 2011}}
Article 13 of the Constitution of Pakistan protects a person from being punished or prosecuted more than once for the same offence.

==Serbia==
{{Expand section|date=April 2011}}
This principle is incorporated in to the Constitution of the Republic of Serbia and further elaborated in its Criminal Procedure Act.&lt;ref&gt;Article 6. of the Criminal Procedure Act - ZAKONIK O KRIVIČNOM POSTUPKU (&quot;Sl. list SRJ&quot;, br. 70/2001 i 68/2002 i &quot;Sl. glasnik RS&quot;, br. 58/2004, 85/2005, 115/2005, 85/2005 - dr. zakon, 49/2007, 20/2009 - dr. zakon i 72/2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

==South Africa==
The [[Bill of Rights (South Africa)|Bill of Rights]] in the [[Constitution of South Africa]] forbids a retrial when there has already been an acquittal or a conviction.
{{quotation|Every accused person has a right to a fair trial, which includes the right ... not to be tried for an offence in respect of an act or omission for which that person has previously been either acquitted or convicted ...|Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996, s. 35(3)(m)}}

==United Kingdom==
===England and Wales===

Double jeopardy has been permitted in [[England and Wales]] since the [[Criminal Justice Act 2003]].

==== Pre-2003 ====
The doctrines of ''autrefois acquit'' and ''autrefois convict'' persisted as part of the [[common law]] from the time of the [[Norman conquest of England]]; they were regarded as essential elements of protection of the liberty of the subject and respect for [[due process]] of law in that there should be finality of proceedings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Benét1864p97&quot; /&gt; There were only three exceptions, all relatively recent, to the rules:
*The prosecution has a right of appeal against acquittal in summary cases if the decision appears to be wrong in law or in excess of jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 ss.28, 111; Supreme Court Act 1981 s.28&lt;/ref&gt;
*A retrial is permissible if the interests of justice so require, following appeal against conviction by a defendant.&lt;ref&gt;Criminal Appeal Act 1968 s.7&lt;/ref&gt;
*A &quot;tainted acquittal&quot;, where there has been an offence of interference with, or intimidation of, a juror or witness, can be challenged in the High Court.&lt;ref name=&quot;CPIA96&quot;&gt;Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996 s.54&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Connelly v DPP]] ([1964] AC 1254), the [[Law Lords]] ruled that a defendant could not be tried for any offence arising out of substantially the same set of facts relied upon in a previous charge of which he had been acquitted, unless there are &quot;special circumstances&quot; proven by the prosecution. There is little case law on the meaning of &quot;special circumstances&quot;, but it has been suggested that the emergence of new evidence would suffice.&lt;ref&gt;Attorney-General for Gibraltar v Leoni, Court of Appeal, 1999 (unreported) see Law Com CP No 156, para 2.24&lt;/ref&gt;

A defendant who had been convicted of an offence could be given a second trial for an aggravated form of that offence if the facts constituting the aggravation were discovered after the first conviction.&lt;ref&gt;R v Thomas [1950] 1 KB 26&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, a person who had been acquitted of a lesser offence could not be tried for an aggravated form even if new evidence became available.&lt;ref&gt;R v Beedie [1998] QB 356, Dingwall, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Post-2003 ====
Following the [[murder of Stephen Lawrence]], the [[Murder of Stephen Lawrence|MacPherson Report]] suggested that double jeopardy should be abrogated where &quot;fresh and viable&quot; new evidence came to light, and the [[Law Commission]] recommended in 2001 that it should be possible to subject an acquitted murder suspect to a second trial. The [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] implemented these recommendations by passing the [[Criminal Justice Act 2003]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2003/30044--k.htm Criminal Justice Act 2003 (c. 44).]&lt;/ref&gt; introduced by then [[Home Secretary]] [[David Blunkett]]. The double jeopardy provisions of the Act came into force in April 2005,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4406129.stm Double jeopardy law ushered out], BBC News.&lt;/ref&gt; but are applicable to crimes committed before then.

Under the 2003 Act, retrials are now allowed if there is &quot;new&quot; and &quot;compelling&quot; evidence for certain serious crimes, including [[murder]], [[manslaughter]], [[kidnapping]], [[rape]], [[robbery|armed robbery]], and serious [[Illegal drug trade|drug crimes]]. All such retrials must be approved by the [[Director of Public Prosecutions]], and the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]] must agree to quash the original acquittal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/section19/chapter_j.html The CPS : Retrial of Serious Offences]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 September 2006, William Dunlop became the first person to be convicted of murder after previously being acquitted. Twice he was tried for the murder of Julie Hogg in [[Billingham]] in 1989, but two juries failed to reach a verdict and he was formally acquitted in 1991. Some years later, he confessed to the crime, and was convicted of perjury. The case was re-investigated in early 2005, when the new law came into effect, and his case was referred to the Court of Appeal in November 2005 for permission for a new trial, which was granted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/tees/4426038.stm Man faces double jeopardy retrial], BBC News.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/tees/5150346.stm Murder conviction is legal first], BBC News.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/5333230.stm The law of 'double jeopardy'], BBC News.&lt;/ref&gt; Dunlop pleaded guilty to murdering Julie Hogg and raping her dead body repeatedly, and was sentenced to life imprisonment, with a recommendation he serve no less than 17 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/tees/5412264.stm Double jeopardy man is given life], BBC News.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 December 2010, Mark Weston became the first person to be convicted of murder after previously being found not guilty of the same offence, that of the murder of Vikki Thompson at [[Ascott-under-Wychwood]] on 12 August 1995. Weston's first trial was in 1996, when the jury found him not guilty. Following the discovery of compelling new evidence in 2009 – Thompson's blood on Weston's boots – Weston was arrested in 2009 and tried for a second time in December 2010, when he was found guilty of Thompson's murder, and sentenced to life imprisonment to serve a minimum of 13 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-oxfordshire-11982681 |title='Double jeopardy' man guilty of Vikki Thompson murder |date=13 December 2010 |work=BBC News Oxford |accessdate=13 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Scotland ===
The double jeopardy rule still applies in [[Scotland]], although the Scottish government on October 7, 2010 introduced legislation to remove the bar to retrials in cases of murder, rape, serious sexual crimes and culpable homicide. In March 2010 the [[Scottish Law Commission]] recommended revision of the ancient constitutional principle in cases of murder and rape, but the proposed legislation extends the repeal also to cases involving culpable homicide and serious sexual crimes (such as sexual crimes against children).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scotland.gov.uk/News/Releases/2010/10/08094209 &quot;Double Jeopardy Reforms,&quot;] Press Release of the Scottish Government, October 10, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The legislation provides for retroactive application so as to permit the retrial of Angus Sinclair for the [[World's End murders]] of Helen Scott and Christine Eadie.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-1097728 &quot;Double jeopardy law will be scrapped in Scotland,&quot;] BBC News, August 14, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Northern Ireland ===

In [[Northern Ireland]] the Criminal Justice Act of 2003, effective April 18, 2005,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nio.gov.uk/media-detail.htm?newsID=11277 &quot;Commencement of Provisions - Criminal Justice Act of 2003,&quot;] Northern Ireland Office.&lt;/ref&gt; makes certain &quot;qualifying offence&quot; (including murder, rape, kidnapping, specified sexual acts with young children, specified drug offences, defined acts of terrorism, as well as in certain cases attempts or conspiracies to commit the foregoing&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2003/ukpga_20030044_en_32#sch5 Schedule 5 Part 2] of the Criminal Justice Act of 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;) subject to retrial after acquittal (including acquittals obtained before passage of the Act) if there is a finding by the Court of Appeals that there is &quot;new and compelling evidence.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2003/ukpga_20030044_en_10#pt10 &quot;Retrial for serious offences,&quot;] Part 10 of Criminal Justice Act of 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2008}}
The ''double jeopardy'' rule arises from the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], the relevant clause of which reads: &quot;[no person shall] be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb&quot;.

This clause is intended to limit abuse by the [[government]] in repeated [[Prosecutor|prosecution]] for the same offense as a means of harassment or oppression. It is also in harmony with the [[common law]] concept of ''[[res judicata]]'' which prevents courts from relitigating issues which have already been the subject of a final judgment.

More specifically, as stated in ''[[Ashe v. Swenson]]'', 397 U.S. 436 (1970): &quot;...when an issue of ultimate fact has once been determined by a valid and final judgment, that issue cannot again be litigated between the same parties in any future lawsuit.&quot; ''Res judicata'' is a term of general application. Underneath that conceptual umbrella is the concept of [[collateral estoppel]]. As applied to double jeopardy, the court will use collateral ''estoppel'' as its basis for forming an opinion.

There are three essential protections included in the double jeopardy principle, which are:

*being tried for the same crime after an acquittal
*retrial after a conviction, unless the conviction has been reversed, vacated or otherwise nullified
*being punished multiple times for the same offense

This rule is occasionally referred to as a [[legal technicality]] because it allows [[defendant]]s a defense that does not address whether the crime was actually committed. For example, were police to uncover new evidence conclusively proving the guilt of someone previously acquitted, there is little they can do because the defendant may not be tried again—at least not on the same or a substantially similar charge. ''[[Fong Foo v. United States]]'', 369 U.S. 141 (1962).

Although the Fifth Amendment initially applied only to the federal government, the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] has ruled that the double jeopardy clause applies to the [[U.S. state|states]] as well through [[Due process#Incorporation|incorporation]] by the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] (''[[Benton v. Maryland]]'').

Jeopardy attaches in a [[jury trial]] once the jury and alternates are impaneled and sworn in. In a [[non-jury trial]] jeopardy attaches once the first evidence is put on which occurs when the first [[witness]] is sworn. {{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

==== Non-final judgments ====
As double jeopardy applies only to charges that were the subject of an earlier ''final'' judgment, there are many situations in which it does not apply despite the appearance of a retrial. For example, a second trial held after a [[Trial#Mistrials|mistrial]] does not violate the double jeopardy clause because a mistrial ends a trial prematurely without a judgment of guilty or not. Cases [[Involuntary dismissal|dismissed]] because of insufficient evidence may constitute a final judgment for these purposes though many state and federal laws allow for substantially limited prosecutorial appeals from these orders. Also, a retrial after a conviction has been set aside following the grant of a motion for [[trial|new trial]], has been reversed on appeal, or has been vacated in a collateral proceeding (such as habeas corpus), does not violate double jeopardy because the judgment in the first trial has been invalidated. In all of these cases, however, the previous trials do not entirely vanish. Testimony from them may be used in later retrials such as to impeach contradictory testimony given at any subsequent proceeding.

==== Fraudulent trials ====
There are two exceptions to the general rule that the prosecution cannot appeal an acquittal:

*If the earlier trial is proven to be a fraud or scam, double jeopardy will not prohibit a new trial. In the case of [[Harry Aleman]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F3/138/302/473725/  Harry Aleman, Petitioner-appellant, v. the Honorable Judges of the Circuit Court of Cook County, criminal Division, Illinois, Honorable Michael P. Toomin,judge Presiding, Honorable Richard Devine, State's Attorney of Cook County, Illinois, Ernesto Velasco, Executive Director, Cook County Department of Corrections,respondents-appellees]; United States Court of Appeals, Seventh Circuit. - 138 F.3d 302; Argued Dec. 2, 1997; Decided March 6, 1998; justia.com&lt;/ref&gt; an appeals court ruled that a man who [[bribery|bribed]] his trial judge and was acquitted of murder was allowed to be tried again because his bribe prevented his first trial from actually putting him in jeopardy.
*Prosecutors may appeal when a trial judge sets aside a jury verdict for conviction with a [[judgment notwithstanding verdict]] for the defendant. A successful appeal by the prosecution would simply reinstate the jury verdict and so would not place the defendant at risk of another trial.

The [[U.S. Supreme Court]] has also upheld laws allowing the government to appeal criminal sentences in limited circumstances (such as that of {{uscsub|18|3742|b}}). The Court ruled that sentences were not accorded the same constitutional finality as jury verdicts under the double jeopardy clause, and giving this right of appeal also did not put the defendant at risk of a succession of prosecutions.

Double jeopardy is also not implicated for separate offenses or in separate jurisdictions arising from the same act. For example, in ''[[United States v. Felix]]'' 503 U.S. 378 (1992), the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] ruled: &quot;a[n]...[[crime|offense]] and a [[Conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] to commit that offense are not the same offense for double jeopardy purposes.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Donofrio |first=Anthony J. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1993 |month= |title=The Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment: The Supreme Court's Cursory Treatment of Underlying Conduct in Successive Prosecutions |journal=Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology |volume=83 |issue=4 |pages=773–803 |doi=10.2307/1143871 |url= http://jstor.org/stable/1143871|accessdate= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Shindala |first=C. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1992 |month= |title=Where Conspiracy To Commit a Crime Is Based on Previously Prosecuted Overt Acts, No Double Jeopardy Violation Exists |journal=Mississippi Law Journal |volume=62 |issue=1 |pages=229–243 |issn=00266280 |url= |accessdate= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Separate sovereigns ====
The &quot;separate sovereigns&quot; exception to double jeopardy arises from the dual nature of the American Federal-State system, one in which states are [[sovereign]]s with [[plenary power]] that have relinquished a number of enumerated powers to the Federal government. Double jeopardy attaches only to prosecutions for the same criminal act by the same sovereign, but as separate sovereigns, both the federal and state governments can bring separate prosecutions for the same act.

As an example, a state might try a defendant for murder, after which the Federal government might try the same defendant for a Federal crime (perhaps a [[civil and political rights|civil rights violation]] or a [[kidnapping]]) connected to the same act. For example, the officers of the [[Los Angeles Police Department]] who were charged with [[assault]]ing [[Rodney King]] in 1991 were acquitted by a [[jury]] of the [[Superior Courts of California|Superior Court]], but some were later convicted and sentenced in Federal court for violating King's civil rights. Similar legal processes were used for prosecuting racially-motivated crimes in the [[Southern United States]] in the 1960s during the time of the [[Civil Rights movement]], when those crimes had not been actively prosecuted, or had resulted in acquittals by juries that were thought to be racist or overly-sympathetic with the accused in local courts.

Federal jurisdiction may apply because the defendant is a member of the armed forces. [[U.S. Army]] [[Master Sergeant]] Timothy B. Hennis was acquitted in state court in [[North Carolina]] for the murders in 1985 of Kathryn Eastburn (age 31) and her daughters Kara, age five, and Erin, age three, who were stabbed to death in their home near [[Fort Bragg, North Carolina]].&lt;ref&gt;Innocent Victims (Onyx True Crime, Je 357) by Scott Whisnant&lt;/ref&gt; Two decades later, Hennis was recalled to active duty, [[court-martial]]ed by the Army for the crime, and convicted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/2020/3rd-trial-master-sgt-timothy-hennis-guilty-1985/story?id=10324918 At 3rd Trial, Master Sgt. Timothy Hennis Guilty of 1985 Triple Murder - ABC News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, the &quot;separate sovereigns&quot; rule allows two states to prosecute for the same criminal act. For example, if a man stood in New York and shot and killed a man standing over the border in Connecticut, both New York and Connecticut could charge the shooter with murder.&lt;ref&gt;''[[United States v. Claiborne]]'', 92 F.Supp.2d  503  (E.D.Va.); tandem state-federal prosecutions ''not prohibited'' under &quot;sovereign rule&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Only the states and tribal jurisdictions&lt;ref&gt;[http://supreme.justia.com/us/435/313/ United States v. Wheeler], 435 U. S. 313 (1978), [http://supreme.justia.com supreme.justia.com].&lt;/ref&gt; are recognized as possessing a separate sovereignty, whereas territories, commonwealths (for example, [[Puerto Rico]]), the military and naval forces, and the [[capital city]] of [[Washington, D.C.]], are exclusively under Federal sovereignty. Acquittal in the court system of any of these entities would therefore preclude a re-trial (or a court-martial) in any court system under Federal jurisdiction.

==== Concerning different legal standards ====
Double jeopardy also does not apply if the later charge is civil rather than criminal in nature, which involves a different legal standard ([[crime]]s must be proven beyond a [[reasonable doubt]], whereas [[tort|civil wrongs]] need only be proven by [[preponderance of evidence]]). Acquittal in a criminal case does not prevent the defendant from being the defendant in a civil suit relating to the same incident (though ''[[res judicata]]'' operates within the [[Civil law (common law)|civil court]] system). For example, [[O. J. Simpson|O.J. Simpson]] was acquitted of a double homicide in a [[California]] criminal prosecution, but lost a civil [[wrongful death claim]] brought over the same victims.

If the defendant happened to be on [[parole]] from an earlier offense at the time, the act for which he or she was acquitted may also be the subject of a parole violation hearing, which is not considered to be a criminal trial. Since parolees are usually subject to restrictions not imposed on other citizens, evidence of actions that were not deemed to be criminal by the court may be re-considered by the parole board. This legal board could deem the same evidence to be proof of a parole violation. In addition, like civil trials parole violation hearings are also subject to a lower standard of proof so it is possible for a parolee to be punished by the parole board for criminal actions that he or she was acquitted of in court.

In the American military or naval [[court-martial|courts-martial]] are subject to the same law of double jeopardy, since the [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]] has incorporated all of the protections of the U.S. Constitution. The non-criminal proceeding [[nonjudicial punishment|non-judicial punishment]] (or NJP) is considered to be akin to a civil case and is subject to lower standards than a court-martial, which is the same as a civilian court of law. NJP proceedings are commonly used to correct or punish minor breaches of military discipline. However if a NJP proceeding fails to produce conclusive evidence, the commanding officer (or ranking official presiding over the NJP) is not allowed to prepare the same charge against the military member in question. In a court-martial, acquittal of the defendant means he is protected permanently from having those charges reinstated.

The most famous American court case invoking the claim of double jeopardy is probably the second murder trial in 1876 of [[Jack McCall]], killer of [[Wild Bill Hickok]]. McCall was acquitted in his first trial, which Federal authorities later ruled to be illegal because it took place in an illegal town, [[Deadwood, South Dakota|Deadwood]], then located in South Dakota Indian Territory. At the time Federal law prohibited all except for Native Americans from settling in the Indian Territory. McCall was retried in Federal Indian Territorial court, convicted, and hanged in 1877. He was the first person ever executed by Federal authorities in the [[Dakota Territory]].

Double jeopardy also does not apply if the defendant was never tried from the start. Charges that were dropped or put on hold for any reason can always be reinstated in the future—if not barred by some [[statute of limitations]].

{{Professional responsibility}}

'''Disbarment''' is the removal of a [[lawyer]] from a [[bar association]] and/or the [[practice of law]], thus revoking his or her [[law license]] and/or [[admission to practice law]]. Procedures vary depending on the [[law society]].

==In the U.S.==
===Overview===
Generally disbarment is imposed as a sanction for conduct indicating that an attorney is not fit to practice law, willfully disregarding the interests of a client, or engaging in fraud which impedes the administration of justice. In addition, any lawyer who is convicted of a [[felony]] is automatically disbarred in most jurisdictions, a policy that, although opposed by the [[American Bar Association]], has been described as a convicted felon's just desserts.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|volume=13|publisher=Hastings Const. L.Q.|pages=433|date=1985-1986|title=Automatic Disbarment: A Convicted Felon's Just Desserts|author=Gentile, Michael A.; McShea, Sarah Diane}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]] legal system, disbarment is specific to regions; one can be disbarred from some courts, while still being a member of the [[bar association|bar]] in another jurisdiction. However, under the [[American Bar Association]]'s [[American Bar Association Model Rules of Professional Conduct|Model Rules of Professional Conduct]], which have been adopted in most states, disbarment in one state or court is grounds for disbarment in a jurisdiction which has adopted the Model Rules.

Disbarment is quite rare.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} Instead, lawyers are usually sanctioned by their own clients through civil malpractice proceedings, or via fine, censure, suspension, or other punishments from the disciplinary boards. To be disbarred is considered a great embarrassment and shame, even if one no longer wishes to pursue a career in the law; it is akin, in effect, to a [[dishonorable discharge]] in a military situation.

Because disbarment rules vary by area, different rules can apply depending on where a lawyer is disbarred. Notably, the majority of US states have no procedure for permanently disbarring a person. Depending on the jurisdiction, a lawyer may reapply to the bar immediately, after five to seven years, or be banned for life.&lt;ref name=&quot;reapply&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3975/is_200707/ai_n19511820/pg_2 | work=The Georgetown Journal of Legal Ethics | title=Should Permanent Disbarment be Permanent? | year=2007 | first=Brian | last=Finkelstein}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Notable U.S. disbarments===
The 20th and the 21st centuries have seen one former U.S. [[President of the United States|president]] and one former U.S. [[Vice President of the United States|vice-president]] disbarred, and another president be both suspended from one bar and resign from another bar rather than face disbarment.

Former Vice President [[Spiro Agnew]], having pleaded [[nolo contendere|no contest]] (which subjects a person to the same criminal penalties as a guilty plea, but is not an admission of guilt for a civil suit) to charges of [[bribery]] and [[tax evasion]], was disbarred from [[Maryland]], the state of which he had previously been [[Governor of Maryland|governor]].

Former President [[Richard Nixon]] was disbarred from [[New York]] in 1976&lt;ref name=&quot;nixon&quot;&gt;http://www.history.com/exhibits/impeach/whthous1.html&lt;/ref&gt; for [[obstruction of justice]] related to the [[Watergate scandal]].

In 2000 the [[Arkansas Supreme Court]]'s Committee on Professional Conduct called for the disbarment of President [[Bill Clinton]], saying he lied about [[Lewinsky scandal|his affair with Monica Lewinsky]]. In January 2001 Clinton reached an agreement under which he was ordered to pay $25,000 in fines to Arkansas state's bar officials and his Arkansas law license was suspended for five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Clinton to contest Supreme Court suspension |publisher=CNN |date=October 2, 2001 |url=http://archives.cnn.com/2001/LAW/10/01/scotus.clinton/ |accessdate=December 21, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The agreement came on the condition that Whitewater prosecutors would not pursue federal [[perjury]] charges against him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bill Clinton Disbarment to End |publisher=AP/11alive.com |date=January 18, 2006 |url=http://www.11alive.com/rss/article.aspx?storyid=74815 |accessdate=December 21, 2006 }}{{dead link|date=September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clinton was suspended by the Supreme Court in October 2001, and, facing disbarment from that court, Clinton resigned from the Supreme Court bar in November.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Clinton asks to quit Supreme Court Bar |publisher=CNN.com |url=http://archives.cnn.com/2001/ALLPOLITICS/11/09/clinton.bar/ |date=November 9, 2001 |accessdate=September 20, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alger Hiss]] was disbarred for a felony conviction, but later became the first person reinstated to the bar in Massachusetts after disbarment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iwannagetthat.com/NewFiles/1948-alger-hiss.html iWannaGetThat - Retroville - 1948 - In the News - Alger Hiss&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jack Thompson (attorney)|Jack Thompson]], the Florida lawyer noted for his activism against video games, was permanently disbarred for various charges of misconduct. The action was the result of several grievances claiming that Thompson had made defamatory, false statements and attempted to humiliate, embarrass, harass or intimidate his opponents. The order was made on September 25, 2008, effective October 25. However, Thompson attempted to appeal to the higher courts in order to avoid the penalty actually taking effect.&lt;ref&gt;http://kotaku.com/5054772/jack-thompson-disbarred&lt;/ref&gt; Neither the US District court, nor the US Supreme Court&lt;ref&gt;http://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/042009zor.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; would hear his appeal, rendering the judgement of the Florida Supreme Court final.

[[F. Lee Bailey]], noted criminal defense attorney in the [[O.J. Simpson murder trial]], was disbarred by the state of Florida in 2001, with reciprocal disbarment in Massachusetts in 2002. The Florida disbarment was the result of his handling of stock in the DuBoc marijuana case. Bailey was found guilty of 7 counts of attorney misconduct by the Florida Supreme Court. Bailey had transferred a large portion of DuBoc's assets into his own accounts, using the interest gained on those assets to pay for personal expenses. In March 2005, Bailey filed to regain his law license in Massachusetts. The book ''Florida Pulp Nonfiction'' details the peculiar facts of the DuBoc case along with extended interviews with Bailey that include his own defense.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7153568/&lt;/ref&gt;

}}
A '''dog tag''' is the informal name for the identification tags worn by military personnel, because of their resemblance to actual [[dog tag]]s.  The tag is primarily used for the identification of dead and wounded along with providing religion (to provide for calling a Catholic Priest or Jewish Rabbi for Last Rites) and essential basic medical information for the treatment of the latter, such as [[blood type]]&lt;ref&gt;''U.S. Soldiers &quot;tagged&quot; for blood transfusion'', Popular Science, February 1942, p71, Scanned by Google Books: http://books.google.com/books?id=pScDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA71-IA1&lt;/ref&gt; and history of [[inoculation]]s. Dog tags are usually fabricated from a corrosion-resistant metal or alloy such as [[aluminum]], [[monel]] or [[stainless-steel]], although, during wartime, they have been made from whatever metals were available. In the US military, if the member has a medical condition that requires special attention, an additional, red tag with the pertinent information is issued and worn with the dog tags.

In the US Military, wearing of the tag is required at all times by soldiers in the field. It may contain two copies of the information and be designed to break easily into two pieces. This allows half the tag to be collected for notification while the other half remains with the body when battle conditions do not allow the casualty to be immediately recovered. Alternatively, in the US Military. two identical tags are issued. One is worn on a long chain around the neck; the second on a much smaller chain attached to the first chain. In the event the wearer is killed, the second tag is collected, and the first remains with the body.  Alternatively, some units allow or require each member to wear one laced into their boot in lieu of the second around the neck.

==History==
[[Image:Dog tags.jpg|thumb|250px|Dog tags of a U.S. Army soldier who served in World War II]]
During the [[American Civil War]] of 1861-1865, some soldiers pinned paper notes with their name and home address to the backs of their coats. Other soldiers stencilled identification on their knapsacks or scratched it in the soft lead backing of the Army belt buckle.

Manufacturers of identification badges recognized a market and began advertising in periodicals. Their pins were usually shaped to suggest a branch of service and engraved with the soldier's name and unit. Machine-stamped tags were also made of [[brass]] or [[lead]] with a hole and usually had (on one side) an eagle or shield and such phrases as &quot;War for the Union&quot; or &quot;Liberty, Union, and Equality&quot;.  The other side had the soldier's name and unit and sometimes a list of [[battle]]s in which he had participated.

A [[New York]]er named John Kennedy wrote to the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] in 1862, offering to furnish discs for all officers and men in the Federal Army, enclosing a design for the disc. The National Archives now has the letter along with the reply, a summary refusal without explanation.

In the [[Spanish-American War]], [[soldier]]s purchased crude stamped identification tags, sometimes with misleading information.

===Franco-Prussian War===
The [[Prussia]]n Army issued identification tags for its troops at the beginning of the [[Franco-Prussian War]] in 1870. They were nicknamed ''Hundemarken'' (the German equivalent of &quot;dog tags&quot;) and compared to a similar identification system instituted for dogs in the Prussian capital city of Berlin at about the same time.&lt;ref&gt;Law, Clive M. Article in Military Artifact, [[Service Publications]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===First World War===
[[Image:South African Navy WW2 dogtag.jpg|thumb|200px|One of the two identity discs issued by the South African Navy during WW2 with rank, surname, initials, force number and religious affiliation]]
The British Army and their Imperial forces in Canada, Australia and New Zealand issued identification tags from the beginning of the First World War. The tags were made of fibre, one in red and one in green, and suspended around the neck by butcher's twine. The same pattern was worn into the Second World War and the Korean War by Commonwealth forces.

The U.S. Army first authorized identification tags in War Department General Order No. 204, dated December 20, 1906, which essentially prescribes the Kennedy identification tag:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;An aluminum identification tag, the size of a silver half dollar and of suitable thickness, stamped with the name, [[military rank|rank]], [[company (military unit)|company]], [[regiment]], or [[corps]] of the wearer, will be worn by each officer and enlisted man of the Army whenever the field kit is worn, the tag to be suspended from the neck, underneath the clothing, by a cord or thong passed through a small hole in the tab. It is prescribed as a part of the uniform and when not worn as directed herein will be habitually kept in the possession of the owner. The tag will be issued by the Quartermaster's Department gratuitously to enlisted men and at cost price to officers...&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Army changed regulations on July 6, 1916, so that all soldiers were issued two tags: one to stay with the body and the other to go to the person in charge of the burial for record-keeping purposes. In 1918, the Army adopted and allotted the [[serial number]] system, and name and serial numbers were ordered stamped on the identification tags of all enlisted troops. (Serial number 1 was assigned to enlisted man Arthur B. Crane of Chicago in the course of his fifth enlistment period.) In 1969, the Army began transitioning (servicemen were issued both a SSN and SN) to the [[Social Security number]] for personnel identification. Some nations (e.g., Germany) instead had a single tag with identical information stamped on both sides of it, which could easily be broken off for the purpose of record keeping.

===World War II===
There is a recurring myth about the notch situated in one end of the dog tags issued to United States Army personnel during World War II. It was rumored that the notch's purpose was that, if a soldier found one of his comrades on the battlefield, he could take one tag to the commanding officer and stick the other between the teeth of the soldier to ensure that the tag would remain with the body and be identified.  In reality, the notch was designed to hold the tag in place when being imprinted on the carbon-paper medical form by the Model 70 [[Addressograph]] (a pistol-type imprinting machine used by the Medical Department during World War II). &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.armydogtags.com/a_PurposeNotch.php], retrieved 22 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose and use of the notch was verified by a [[Snopes]] article, in which Snopes consulted with [[US Army]] [[Mortuary Affairs]]. &lt;ref&gt;Barbara Mikkelson. [http://www.snopes.com/military/notch.asp &quot;Notch for the Faint Hearted&quot;,] ''Snopes.com'', 2 August 2007, retrieved 12 September 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

As a side note, it appears instructions that would confirm the notch's mythical use were issued at least unofficially by the [[Graves Registration Service]] during the [[Vietnam War]] to Army troops headed overseas. &lt;ref&gt;Col. David G. Fitz-Enz (Ret.): ''Why A Soldier? A Signal Corpsman's Tour from Vietnam to the Moscow Hotline'', page 166. Ballantine, 2000. ISBN 0-8041-1938-4&lt;/ref&gt;

Following World War II, the US Navy Department adopted the dog tags used by the US Army and Air Force, so a single shape and size became the American standard.

===Vietnam===
In the [[Vietnam War]], American soldiers were allowed to place rubber silencers on their dog tags so the enemy would not hear the metallic clanking. Others chose to tape the two tags together with black tape.  Still others chose to wear one tag around the neck and the other tag on the lace of one boot.  All three variations were commonly seen among U.S. troops.

Dog tags are traditionally part of the makeshift battlefield memorials soldiers created for their fallen comrades. The casualty's rifle with [[bayonet]] affixed is stood vertically atop the empty boots, with the helmet over the stock of the rifle. The dog tags hang from the rifle's handle or trigger guard.

==Non-military use==
[[Image:Personalizeddogtags.jpg|right|200px|thumbnail|Close-up of a teenager wearing custom-made dog tags]]
Dog tags have recently found their way into youth fashion by way of [[Chic: M-Z#Military chic|military chic]]. Originally worn as a part of a military uniform by youths wishing to present a tough or militaristic image, dog tags have since seeped out into wider fashion circles. They may be inscribed with a person's details, their beliefs or tastes, a favorite quote, or may bear the name or logo of a band or performer. Some people also prefer to have the information on their tags transferred to a smaller, sometimes golden or silver tag by a jeweler, as the original tag can be considered too large and bulky by some. Some are also used for health problems, such as heart problems or epilepsy.

====Fashion====
Since the late 1990s, custom dog tags have become fashionable amongst musicians (particularly rappers), and as a marketing giveaway item. Numerous companies &lt;!-- do not list examples - not notable --&gt; offer customers the opportunity to create their own personalized dog tags with their own photos, logos, and text. Even high end jewelers such as [[Cartier SA|Cartier]] and [[Tiffany &amp; Co.|Tiffany]] have featured gold and silver dog tags encrusted with diamonds and other jewels.

==National variations==

===Argentina===
Argentinian ID tags are long, rectangular metal pieces with oval ends.  Four lines of information are required:
*Family Name and First Name
*8-digit DNI Number
*GS (blood group, e.g., G.S O RH +)
*Military class (e.g., F.W CS-10-81)

===Austria===
The Austrian &quot;Bundesheer&quot; utilized a single long, rectangular tag with oval ends, stamped with blood group &amp; Rh factor at the end, with ID number underneath.  Two slots &amp; a hole stamped beneath the number allow the tag to be broken in half, and the long bottom portion has both the ID number and a series of holes which allow sthe tag to be inserted into a dosimeter.  This has been replaced with a more conventional, wider &amp; rounded rectangle which can still be halved, but lacks the dosimeter reading holes.

===Australia===
The Australian Defence Force issues soldiers two tags of different shapes: Number 1 Tag (the octagonal shaped disc) and Number 2 Tag (the circular disc). The format is as follows:
*AS [denoting Australia]
*PMKeyS Number [The Australian Defence Force stopped issuing service numbers to members. Some older members also have a service number.]
*Initial
*Last Name 
*Religious Preference [RC - Roman Catholic, ANG - Anglican, just to name a few]
*Blood Group
Example:
*AS
*8549302
*D
*SMITH 
*RC
*A POS
The information is printed exactly the same on both discs.

===Belgium===
Belgian Forces identity tags are, like the Canadian and Norwegian, designed to be broken in two in case of fatality; the lower half is returned to Belgian Defence Headquarters, while the upper half remains on the body. The tags contain the following information:

*Upper half:
**Belgisch Leger (Belgian Army)
**Service number
**Surname
**Gender
**Date of birth
**Religion and blood group with RH factor

*Lower half: identical.

===Canada===
[[File:CFID.JPG|thumb|250px|Canadian Forces ID Disk. Name, rank, and service number are redacted.]]
[[Canadian Forces]] identity discs (abbreviated &quot;I discs&quot;) are designed to be broken in two in the case of fatality; the lower half is returned to [[National Defence Headquarters]] with the member's personal documents, while the upper half remains on the body. The tags contain the following information:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.admfincs.forces.gc.ca/admfincs/subjects/cfao/026-04_e.asp Canadian Forces Administrative Order 26-4 - Identity Discs] Canadian Forces Finance &amp; Corporate Services website&lt;/ref&gt;
*Upper half:
**[[Service number#Canada|Service Number (SN)]]
**Initials and surname
**Religion (or &quot;NRE&quot; if none) and blood group with RH factor
**The legend &quot;CDN FORCES CDN&quot; (or for foreign nationals, the name of the country the individual represents)
**The text &quot;DO NOT REMOVE / NE PAS ENLEVER&quot; on the reverse
*Lower half: identical, except it does not contain the blood type, and the reverse is blank.

Before the Service Number was introduced in the 1990s, military personnel were identified on the I discs (as well as other documents) by their [[Social Insurance Number]].

===Colombia===

The &quot;Ejército Nacional de Colombia&quot; uses long, rectangular metal tags with oval ends tags stamped with the following information:
*Family Name
*First Name
*Military ID Number
*Blood Type
*Branch of Service

Duplicate tags are issued. Often, tags are issued with a prayer inscribed on the reverse.

===Cyprus===
In Cyprus, identification tags include the following information:
*[[family name|Surname]]
*First name
*Service number (E.g., 11111/00/00B, where the first five digits are the ID, the second two are the year the soldier turned 18 years old, the last two digits are the year the soldier enlisted, and the letter is the enlistment group, either A or B)
*[[Blood Group]]

===Denmark===
[[Military of Denmark|Danish]] dog tags are a small metallic plate, designed to be broken in two. The information on the tag is:
*[[Personal identification number (Denmark)|Personal identification number]]
*Surname
*First name
On the right hand side of the tag it says ''Danmark'', the Danish word for &quot;Denmark&quot;.

===East Germany===
The National Volksarmee used a tag nearly identical with that used by both the Wehrmacht and the (West) German Bundeswehr.  The oval aluminum tag was stamped &quot;DDR&quot; (Deutsche Demokratische Republik) above the personal ID number; this information was repeated on the bottom half, which was intended to be broken off in case of death.  Oddly, the tag was not worn, but required to be kept in a plastic sleeve in the back of the WDA identity booklet.    

===Ecuador===
The &quot;Placas de identificación de campaña&quot; consists of 2 long, rectangular steel or aluminum tags with rounded corners &amp; a single hole punched in one end.  It is stamped in 3 lines with: Family Name &amp; First Name; Identification Number; and Blood Group, plus &quot;RH&quot; and &quot;+&quot; or &quot;-&quot;. It is suspended by a US-type ball chain, with a shorter chain for the second tag. 

===Finland===
[[File:Suomalainen tuntolevy.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Blank Finnish dog tag]]
[[Finnish Defence Forces|Finnish]] dog tags are also designed to be broken in two; however, the only text on it is the [[National identification number#Finland|personal identification number]] and the letters ''SF'', which stands for Suomi Finland, within a [[Finnish Defence Forces|tower]] stamped atop of the upper half.

===France===
France issues either a metallic rounded rectangle (Army) or disk (Navy), designed to be broken in half, bearing Family Name &amp; First Name above the ID number. 

===Germany===
[[File:Erkennungsmarke BW.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Frontside of a German ID tag from 1961]]
German [[Bundeswehr]] ID tags are a oval-shaped discs designed to be broken in half. The two sides contain different informations which are mirrored upside-down on the lower half of the ID tag. They feature the following information on segmented and numbered fields:

On the frontside
*Field 1: blank
*Field 2: DEU (for Deutschland)(GE (for Germany) only on older ID tags)
*Field 3: Religious preference (usually &quot;rk&quot; for Roman Catholic, or &quot;ev&quot; for Protestant)
*Field 4: Personenkennziffer (service number: birth date in DDMMYY format, dash, capitalized first letter of last name, dash, and five-digit number based on soldier's home military administrative district, number of persons with the mentioned last name and same birthday, and an error-checking number but without dashes), ex. 101281-S-455(-)6(-)8

On the backside
*Field 5: Blood group (ABO)
*Field 6: [[Rhesus factor]]
*Field 7: Vaccination status
*Fields 8 - 10: blank

===Greece===
In Greece, identification tags include the following information:
*[[family name|Surname]]
*First name
*Service number (where date of birth is included as &quot;class&quot;)
*[[Blood Group]]
Not all corps in the Greek forces are given ID tags (for example, soldiers in the engineer corps are not issued tags, while those in the Infantry and Artillery are).

===Hungary===
The [[Military of Hungary|Hungarian]] army dog tag is made out of steel, forming a 25×35&amp;nbsp;mm tag designed to split diagonally. Both sides contain the same information: the soldier's personal identity code, blood group and the word HUNGARIA. Some may not have the blood group on them. These are only issued to soldiers who are serving outside of the country. If the soldier should die, one side is removed and kept for the army's official records, while the other side is left attached to the body.

===Iraq===
The Saddam-era Iraqi Army utilized a single, long, rectangular metal tag with oval ends, inscribed (usually by hand) with Name and Number or Unit, and occasionally Blood Type.

===Israel===
[[Israel Defense Forces|Israeli]] dog tags are designed to be broken in two. The information appears in three lines (twice):
*Army identification number (&quot;mispar ishi&quot;, literally: personal number. A seven-digit number that is different from the nine-digit [[Teudat Zehut|identification number]] for citizens).
*Last name
*First Name

In case of capture, Israeli soldiers are instructed to provide the information that appears on the dog tag and their rank only.
Another dog tag is kept inside the military boot in order to identify dead soldiers.

Originally the IDF issued two circular aluminum tags (1948 - late 1950s) stamped in 3 lines with Serial number, Family Name, and First Name. The tags were threaded together through a single hole onto a cord worn around the neck.

===Malaysia===
[[Malaysian Armed Forces]] have two identical oval tags with this information:
*[[National identification number|A 12-digit number]] (The last digit is an odd number for a male soldier, while an even number is given for a female soldier.)
*Service number
*Full name
*[[Blood type]]
*Religion
*Branch (e.g., [[Royal Malaysian Navy|TLDM]])

If more information needed, another two oval wrist tags are provided.  The term ''wrist tags'' can be used to refer to the [[bracelet]]-like [[wristwatch]]. The additional tags only need to be worn on the wrist, with the main tags still on the neck. All personnel are allowed to attach a small religious [[pendant]] or [[locket]]; this makes a quick identifiable reference for their funeral services.

===Mexico===
The Ejército de Mexico uses a single long, rectangular metal tag with oval ends, embossed with Name, serial number, and blood type plus Rh factor.

===Netherlands===
[[Military of the Netherlands]] identity tags, like the Canadian and Norwegian ones, are designed to be broken in two in case of fatality; the lower half is returned to Dutch Defence Headquarters, while the upper half remains on the body. There is a difference in the Army and Airforce service number and the Navy service number:
*[[Army number]] is made up of the date of birth in YY.MM.DD. format, for example 83.01.15, and a three-digit number, such as 123.
*Navy number is made up out of random five- or six-digit numbers.

The tags contain the following information:
*Upper half:
**Name and family name
**Service number
**Nationality (NL) and religion
**Blood group with [[Rhesus blood group system|RH]] factor

*Lower half: identical.

===Norway===
[[Norway|Norwegian]] dog tags are designed to be broken in two like the Canadian version:
* The top half contains the nationality, [[National_identification_number#Norway|the eleven-digit birth number]] and the blood type.
* The bottom half contains the nationality and birth number and has a hole so the broken-off half can be hung on a ring.

===Poland===
The first dog tags were issued in Poland following the order of the General Staff of December 12, 1920. The earliest design (dubbed ''kapala'' in Polish, more properly called &quot;kapsel legitymacyjny&quot; or &quot;ID cap&quot;) consisted of a tin-made 30×50&amp;nbsp;mm rectangular frame and a rectangular cap fitting into the frame. Soldiers' details were filled in a small ID card placed inside the frame, as well as on the inside of the frame itself. The dog tag was similar to the tags used by the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] during [[World War I]]. In case the soldier died, the frame was left with his body, while the lid was returned to his unit together with a note on his death. The ID card was handed over to the chaplain or the rabbi.

In 1928, a new type of dog tag was proposed by [[generał brygady|gen. bryg.]] [[Stanisław Rouppert]], Poland's representative at the [[International Red Cross]]. It was slightly modified and adopted in 1931 under the name of Nieśmiertelnik wz. 1931 (literally, Immortalizer mark 1931). The new design consisted of an oval piece of metal (ideally steel, but in most cases aluminium alloy was used), roughly 40 by 50 milimetres. There were two notches on both sides of the tag, as well as two rectangular holes in the middle to allow for easier breaking of the tag in two halves. The halves contained the same set of data and were identical, except the upper half had two holes for a string or twine to go through. The data stamped on the dog tag included:

* Obverse
** Name
** Surname
** Optionally: abbreviation of soldiers' religion (KAT for Roman Catholics, GR-KAT for Greek Catholics, PRAW for Orthodox, MOJ for Jewish, AUG for Lutherans, ANG for Anglicans and MAH for Muslims)
* Reverse
** Soldiers' ID card number and first letter of the [[powiat]] the soldier came from
** Name of the Recruitment Commission (usually name of the town or city the soldier was attached to)
** Year of birth

Sometimes the rank of the soldier was added to the reverse, and most members of the medical corps had a tiny cross stamped near the string holes, regardless of their religion.

===Rhodesia===

The former Republic of Rhodesia used two WW2 British-style compressed asbestos fiber tags, a No. 1 octagonal (green) tag and a No. 2 circular (red) tag, stamped with identical information.  The red tag was supposedly fireproof and the green tag rotproof.  The following information was stamped on the tags: Number, Name, Initials, &amp; Religion; Blood Type was stamped on reverse.  The Air Force &amp; BSAP often stamped their service on the reverse side above the blood group.  

Many soldiers state they were issued blank tags and told to punch the information in themselves. 

===Russia===
[[File:Dog-tag-modern-russia.jpg|thumb|A dog tag used by the Russian armed forces]]

[[Russian Armed Forces]] use dog tags with only &quot;ВС РОССИИ&quot; ({{lang-ru|Russian Armed Forces}}) and the unique serviceman ID on it. Each soldier receives two identical dog tags, issued by either the [[military commissariat]] or his home station.

Before the dissolution of the [[Soviet Union]], the [[Red Army]] used dog tags similar to modern Russian ones, but with &quot;ВС СССР&quot; ({{lang-ru|USSR Armed Forces}}) engraved upon them.

===Singapore===
The [[Singapore Armed Forces]]-issued dog tags are inscribed (not embossed) with up to four items:
* [[NRIC number]]
* Blood type
* Religion
* Drug allergies (if any; inscribed on the reverse)

The dog tags consist of two metal pieces, one oval with two holes and one round with one hole. A synthetic lanyard is threaded through both holes in the oval piece and tied around the wearer's neck. The round piece is tied to the main loop on a shorter loop.

When a soldier is killed in action, the round piece is removed by cutting the short loop with a bayonet, while the oval piece remains with the body.

===South Africa===
The former South African Defense Force used two long, rectangular aluminum tags with oval ends, stamped with Serial Number, Name and Initials, and Religion.

===South Korea===
The South Korean army issues two long, rectangular tags with oval ends, stamped (in Korean letters) with &quot;Ryuk Gun&quot; (&quot;Army&quot;) above personal number, with name below that and blood group at bottom.

===Spain===
Issues a single metal oval, worn vertically, stamped &quot;ESPAÑA&quot; above and below the 3-slot horizontal break line. It is stamped in 4 lines with:
*1st line - Religion
*2nd line - left side = blood group, right side = any medical allergies (SI or NO)
*3rd line - military service (ET, EA ...)
*4th (longest) line = DNI military number.
All information is repeated on the bottom half of the tag, which is to be broken off and returned to the unit in case of death or injury in combat.

===Sweden===
[[Image:Swedogtag.jpg|thumb|Swedish civilian dog tag (1970s)]]
Swedish dog tags are designed to be able to break apart. The information on them is:
* [[Personal identity number (Sweden)|Personal identity number]] (twice, once in the upper part and once below)
* Full name
* Place of birth
* Blood type (only on some)

The dog tags during the Cold War were issued to everyone, often soon after birth. However in the late 90s the Swedish government decided that the dog tags were not needed anymore, most probably because of the Cold War had ended.

The blood type is generally not stamped on the dog tags as it may change (rare) and that, in combat situations, they give standard blood (type 0) and, in hospitals, it is easier to check the blood than the tag.

===Switzerland===
[[Swiss Armed Forces]] ID tags are oval-shaped and are designed to be broken in two. In case of fatality, the tag will be completely removed. They contain the following information:
* Social insurance number
* Surname
* First name
* Date of birth in DD.MM.YY format

===United Kingdom===

The UK Armed Forces utilize two circular stainless steel tags embossed with the &quot;Big 6&quot;: Blood Group; Service Number; Surname; Initials; 2-letter Religious code (e.g. CE for Church of England, RC for Catholic, OD for Other Denomination, etc.); &amp; Force (e.g. RN, Army, or RAF).  One tag is suspended 6 inches below main tag. 

===United States===
US Armed Forces typically carry two identical oval tags containing:

:[[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] Format 1:&lt;ref name=&quot;USAF&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=AFI 36-3103|url=http://www.e-publishing.af.mil/shared/media/epubs/AFI36-3103.pdf|date=1 May 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:*Surname, first name, middle initial
:*Social Security number, followed by &quot;AF&quot; indicating branch of service
:*Blood Group
:*&quot;blank&quot;
:*Religion (or &quot;NO RELIGIOUS PREF&quot; if none)

:U.S. Air Force Format 2:&lt;ref name=&quot;USAF&quot;/&gt;
:*Surname
:*First name and middle initial
:*Social Security number, followed by &quot;AF&quot; indicating branch of service
:*Blood Group
:*Religion (or &quot;NO RELIGIOUS PREF&quot; if none)

:[[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine Corps]]:
:*Surname
:*First and middle initials, blood group
:*Social Security number with no dashes and no spaces
:*Branch (&quot;USMC&quot;), Gas mask size (S-small, M-medium, L-large)
:*Religious preference (or &quot;NO PREFERENCE&quot;), or medical allergy if red medical tag

:[[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]]:
:*Surname, first name, middle initial
:*Social Security number with no dashes or spaces followed immediately by &quot;USN&quot;, space, blood group
:*&quot;blank&quot;
:*Religion (or &quot;NORELPREF&quot; if none)

:[[United States Army|U.S. Army]]:
:*Surname
:*First name, middle initial
:*Social Security number
:*Blood type
:*Religion

:[[United States Coast Guard|U.S. Coast Guard]]:
:*Surname, first name, middle initial
:*Social Security number, no dashes or spaces, followed immediately by branch (i.e., 123456789 USCG)
:*Blood group
:*&quot;blank&quot;
:*Religion

Recently, the U.S. Army stopped using the term ''dog tags'', replacing it with ''ID tags''.

US Forces are also permitted to wear a small religious medallion, usually provided for them, on the smaller chain (e.g., a [[Christian Cross|Cross]] or [[Star of David]]). This provides a quick, easily identifiable reference for a chaplain should his services be required.

====US military ID tag ball chain specifications and lore====
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2009}}
Standard US military dog tags are issued with one 2.5&amp;nbsp;mm, 24-inch neck chain and one 2.5&amp;nbsp;mm, 4-inch duplicate chain. The secondary chain and duplicate tag are recovered if needed. The primary chain and tag remain with the soldier at all times.

Ball chain may be upgraded to 3&amp;nbsp;mm diameter by individual soldiers. Chains smaller than 2.5&amp;nbsp;mm and larger than 3&amp;nbsp;mm are not generally authorized due to the risk of breakage/loss or inability to recover the duplicate tag from larger chains.

Dog tag ball chains were once thought to have been clipped to length to help captured soldiers count time in the event they were captured. The large chain was counted to 365 ball links, and the small chain was counted to 52 ball links. A soldier could then bite or break off one link from the large chain each day and remove one link from the small chain each week. This accounted for one year of time before the cycle consumed the chain completely. No verified comparison between the standard 24&quot; and 4&quot; chain lengths and number of &quot;beads&quot; per length has been performed. The typical length of 365/52 however, is adequate for mounting and wearing standard I.D. tags.  This however is not true as a U.S. Air Force 210 bead chain is 27.5&quot; long (which hangs in the middle of ones chest).  A 365 bead chain is approximately 47.25&quot;, which hangs down too far on the average person.

===Viet Nam===

The former Army of the Republic of Viet Nam (South Viet Nam) used two US-style ID tags, in either stainless steel or aluminum, stamped or inscribed with: 
*Name
*SQ (So Quân, e.g., Service number) a 2-digit year number, followed by a military serial number
*LM (loai máu, e.g., Blood Group, no rH factor)

Some tags added religion, e.g., Công Giáo for Catholic

The '''drum''' is a member of the [[percussion instrument|percussion]] group of musical instruments, technically classified as the [[Artificial membrane|membranous]].&lt;ref name=grove&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians|The New Grove Encyclopædia of Music and Musicians]]|edition=2nd|first=George|last=Grove|authorlink=George Grove|editor=[[Stanley Sadie]]|year=2001|month=January|publisher=Grove's Dictionaries of Music|pages=Volume 5, pp638&amp;ndash;649|isbn=1561592390}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drums consist of at least one [[Artificial membrane|membrane]], called a [[drumhead]] or drum skin, that is stretched over a shell and struck, either directly with the player's hands, or with a [[drumstick]], to produce [[sound]]. There is usually a &quot;resonance head&quot; on the underside of the drum, these are usually tuned to a slightly lower pitch than the top drumhead. Other techniques have been used to cause drums to make sound, such as the [[Tambourine#Thumb_roll|thumb roll]].  Drums are the world's oldest and most ubiquitous musical instruments, and the basic design has remained virtually unchanged for thousands of years.&lt;ref name=grove&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians|The New Grove Encyclopædia of Music and Musicians]]|edition=2nd|first=George|last=Grove|authorlink=George Grove|editor=[[Stanley Sadie]]|year=2001|month=January|publisher=Grove's Dictionaries of Music|pages=Volume 4, pp638&amp;ndash;649|isbn=1561592390}}
&lt;/ref&gt; 

A few types of  drums such as [[timpani]] are always tuned to a certain pitch. Often, several drums, other than timpani drums, can be arranged together to create a [[drum kit]].&lt;ref name=Black&gt;{{cite book|title=Drumset Independence and Syncopation

==Construction==
[[Image:DrumMozartRegiment.jpg|thumb|Drum carried by [[John Unger]], Company B, 40th Regiment New York Veteran Volunteer Infantry Mozart Regiment, December 20, 1863]]
The shell almost invariably has a circular opening over which the drumhead is stretched, but the shape of the remainder of the shell varies widely. In the western musical tradition, the most usual shape is a [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]], although [[timpani]], for example, use [[bowl (vessel)|bowl]]-shaped shells.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt; Other shapes include a frame design ([[tar (drum)|tar]], [[Bodhrán]]), truncated cones ([[bongo drum]]s, [[Ashiko]]), [[Goblet drum|goblet shaped]] ([[djembe]]), and joined truncated cones ([[talking drum]]).

Drums with cylindrical shells can be open at one end (as is the case with [[timbales]]), or can have two drum heads. Single-headed drums normally consist of a skin which is stretched over an enclosed space, or over one of the ends of a hollow vessel. Drums with two heads covering both ends of a cylindrical shell often have a small hole somewhat halfway between the two heads; the shell forms a [[resonance|resonating]] chamber for the resulting sound. Exceptions include the African [[slit drum]], also known as a log drum as it is made from a hollowed-out tree trunk, and the [[steel drum|Caribbean steel drum]], made from a metal barrel. Drums with two heads can also have a set of wires, called snares, held across the bottom head, top head, or both heads, hence the name [[snare drum]].&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;

On modern [[band (music)|band]] and [[orchestral]] drums, the drumhead is placed over the opening of the drum, which in turn is held onto the shell by a &quot;counterhoop&quot; (or &quot;rim), which is then held by means of a number of tuning screws called &quot;tension rods&quot; which screw into lugs placed evenly around the circumference. The head's tension can be adjusted by loosening or tightening the rods. Many such drums have six to ten tension rods. The sound of a drum depends on several variables, including shape, size and thickness of its shell, materials from which the shell was made, counterhoop material, type of drumhead used and tension applied to it, position of the drum, location, and the velocity and angle in which it is struck.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;

Prior to the invention of tension rods drum skins were attached and tuned by rope systems such as that used on the [[Djembe]] or pegs and ropes such as that used on [[Ewe music|Ewe Drums]], a system rarely used today, although sometimes seen on regimental marching band snare drums.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;

==Sound of a drum==
[[Image:Drums for sale at the National Museum of the American Indian.jpg|thumb|right|Several [[Amerindians|American Indian]]-style drums for sale at the [[National Museum of the American Indian]].]]
Several factors determine the sound a drum produces, including the type, shape and construction of the drum shell, the type of [[drum head]]s it has, and the tension of these drumheads.  Different drum sounds have different uses in music. Take, for example, the modern [[Tom-tom drum]]. A [[jazz]] drummer may want drums that are high pitched, resonant and quiet whereas a [[Rock music|rock]] drummer may prefer drums that are loud, dry and low-pitched. Since these drummers want different sounds, their drums will be constructed a little differently.

The drum head has the most effect on how a drum sounds. Each type of drum head serves its own musical purpose and has its own unique sound. Double-ply drumheads dampen high frequency harmonics since they are heavier and they are suited to heavy playing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.drumbook.org Drum Lessons] - Drumbook.org&lt;/ref&gt; Drum heads with a white, textured coating on them muffle the [[overtone]]s of the drum head slightly, producing a less diverse [[Pitch (music)|pitch]].  Drum heads with central silver or black dots tend to muffle the overtones even more.  And drum heads with [[perimeter]] sound rings mostly eliminate overtones (Howie 2005). Some jazz drummers avoid using thick drum heads, preferring single ply drum heads or drum heads with no muffling.  Rock drummers often prefer the thicker or coated drum heads.

The second biggest factor affecting the sound produced by a drum is the tension at which the drum head is held against the shell of the drum.  When the hoop is placed around the drum head and shell and tightened down with tension rods, the tension of the head can be adjusted. When the tension is increased, the [[amplitude]] of the sound is reduced  and the [[frequency]] is increased, making the pitch higher and the volume lower.

The type of shell also affects the sound of a drum. Because the vibrations [[Resonance|resonate]] in the shell of the drum, the shell can be used to increase the volume and to manipulate the type of sound produced. The larger the diameter of the shell, the lower the pitch. The larger the depth of the drum, the louder the volume. Shell thickness also determines the volume of drums. Thicker shells produce louder drums. [[Mahogany]] raises the frequency of low pitches and keeps higher frequencies at about the same speed. When choosing a set of shells, a jazz drummer may want smaller maple shells, while a rock drummer may want larger birch shells.

==Uses==
Drums are usually played by the hand, or by one or two sticks. In many traditional cultures drums have a symbolic function and are often used in religious ceremonies. Drums are often used in [[music therapy]], especially hand drums, because of their tactile nature and easy use by a wide variety of people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

Within the realm of [[popular music]] and [[jazz]], &quot;drums&quot; usually refers to a [[drum kit]] or a set of drums (with some [[cymbals]]) and &quot;[[drummer]]&quot; to the actual band member or person who plays them.

Drums acquired even divine status in places such as [[Burundi]], where the ''[[karyenda]]'' was a symbol of the power of the king.

===Animal drumming===
[[Macaque monkey]]s drum objects in a rhythmic way to show [[social dominance]] and this has been shown to be processed in a similar way in their brains to vocalizations suggesting an evolutionary origin to drumming as part of social communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Remedios | first1 = R | last2 = Logothetis | first2 = NK | last3 = Kayser | first3 = C | title = Monkey drumming reveals common networks for perceiving vocal and nonvocal communication sounds. | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 106 | issue = 42 | pages = 18010–5 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19805199 | pmc = 2755465 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0909756106 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other [[primate]]s make drumming sounds by chest beating or hand clapping,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Clark Arcadi | first1 = A | last2 = Robert | first2 = D | last3 = Mugurusi | first3 = F | title = A comparison of buttress drumming by male chimpanzees from two populations. | journal = Primates; journal of primatology | volume = 45 | issue = 2 | pages = 135–9 | year = 2004 | pmid = 14735390 | doi = 10.1007/s10329-003-0070-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1007/s10329-009-0130-9 | last1 = Kalan | first1 = AK | last2 = Rainey | first2 = HJ. | year = 2009 | title = Hand-clapping as a communicative gesture by wild female swamp gorillas | url = | journal = Primates | volume = 50 | issue = 3| pages = 273–5 | pmid = 19221858 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[rodent]]s such as [[kangaroo rat]]s also make similar sounds using their paws on the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Randall | first1 = JA. | year = 2001 | title = Evolution and Function of Drumming as Communication in Mammals | url = http://intl-icb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/41/5/1143 | journal = American Zoologist | volume = 41 | issue = 5| pages = 1143–1156 | doi = 10.1668/0003-1569(2001)041[1143:EAFODA]2.0.CO;2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Talking drums===
In the past drums have been used not only for their musical qualities, but also as a means of [[drum (communication)|communication]], especially through signals. The [[talking drum]]s of Africa can imitate the inflections and pitch variations of a spoken language and are used for [[communication|communicating]] over great distances. Throughout [[History of Sri Lanka|Sri Lankan history]] drums have been used for communication between the state and the community, and Sri Lankan drums have a history stretching back over 2500 years.

Chinese troops used [[tàigǔ]] drums to motivate troops, to help set a marching pace, and to call out orders or announcements. For example, during a war between Qi and Lu in 684 BC,  the effect of drum on soldier's morale is employed to change  the  result of a major battle. Fife-and-drum corps of [[Switzerland|Swiss]] mercenary foot soldiers also used drums. They used an early version of the [[snare drum]] carried over the player's right shoulder, suspended by a strap (typically played with one hand using [[traditional grip]]). It is to this instrument that the English word &quot;drum&quot; was first used. Similarly, during the [[English Civil War]] rope-tension drums would be carried by junior officers as a means to relay commands from senior officers over the noise of battle. These were also hung over the shoulder of the drummer and typically played with two drum sticks. Different [[regiment]]s and companies would have distinctive and unique drum beats which only they would recognize. In the mid-19th century, the Scottish military started incorporating [[pipe band]]s into their Highland Regiments.&lt;ref&gt;Chatto, Allan. (1996).

'''Delphi''' ({{IPA-en|ˈdɛlfaɪ}} or {{IPA-en|ˈdɛlfi|}}, [[Greek language|Greek]] {{polytonic|Δελφοί}}, {{IPA-el|ðelˈfi|}}&lt;ref&gt;In English, the name ''Delphi'' is pronounced either as {{IPA-en|ˈdɛlfaɪ|}} or, in a more the Greek-like manner, as {{IPA|/ˈdɛlfiː}}.  The Greek spelling transliterates as &quot;Delphoi&quot; &quot;Delphi&quot;, in Greece, means &quot;Perfect to god/godess&quot; (with an o); [[Ancient Greek dialects|dialectal]] forms include '''Belphoi''' &amp;ndash; [[Aeolic Greek|Aeolian]] form, '''Dalphoi''' &amp;ndash; [[Phocian]] form, as if well as [http://www.travel-to-delphi.com/page.php?id=3&amp;back=delphi.php other Greek dialectal varieties]&lt;/ref&gt;) is both an [[archaeology|archaeological]] site and a modern town in [[Greece]] on the south-western spur of [[Mount Parnassus]] in the valley of [[Phocis]]. 

In [[Greek mythology]], Delphi was the site of the [[Pythia|Delphic oracle]], the most important [[oracle]] in the classical Greek world, and a major site for the worship of the god [[Apollo]] after he slew the [[Python (mythology)|Python]], a deity who lived there and protected the [[Omphalos|navel]] of the [[Gaia (mythology)|Earth]].  Python (derived from the verb pythein, &quot;to rot&quot;) is claimed by some to be the original name of the site in recognition of the Python that Apollo defeated.&lt;ref name=&quot;miller95&quot;&gt;Miller, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Homeric Hymns|Homeric Hymn to Delphic Apollo]] recalled that the ancient name of this site had been ''Krisa''.&lt;ref&gt;''Hymn to Pythian Apollo'', l. 254&amp;ndash;74: [[Telphousa]] recommends to Apollo to build his oracle temple at the site of &quot;Krisa below the glades of [[Parnassus]]&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Apollo's sacred precinct in Delphi was a panhellenic sanctuary, where every four years, starting in 586 BC&lt;ref name=&quot;miller96&quot;&gt;Miller, p.96&lt;/ref&gt; athletes from all over the Greek world competed in the [[Pythian Games]], one of the four [[Panhellenic Games|panhellenic]] (or stephanitic) [[Panhellenic Games|games]], precursors of the [[Modern Olympics]].  The victors at Delphi were presented with a laurel crown which was ceremonially cut from a tree by a boy who re-enacted the slaying of the Python.&lt;ref name=&quot;miller96&quot;/&gt; Delphi was set apart from the other games sites because it hosted the mousikos agon, musical competitions.&lt;ref name=&quot;miller95&quot;/&gt; These Pythian Games rank second among the four stephanitic games chronologically and based on importance.&lt;ref name=&quot;miller96&quot;/&gt;  These games, though, were different from the games at Olympia in that they were not of such vast Importance to the city of Delphi as the games at Olympia were to the city of Olympia.  Delphi would have been a renowned city whether or not it hosted these games; it had other attractions that led to it being labeled the &quot;omphalos&quot; (navel) of the earth, in other words, the center of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, pp. 96&amp;ndash;7&lt;/ref&gt;

In the inner ''hestia'' (&quot;hearth&quot;) of the Temple of Apollo, an [[eternal flame]] burned.  After the [[battle of Plataea]], the Greek cities extinguished their fires and brought new fire from the hearth of Greece, at Delphi; in the [[foundation story|foundation stories]] of several Greek colonies, the founding colonists were first dedicated at Delphi.&lt;ref&gt;Burkert 1985, pp. 61, 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
&lt;!-- [[Image:Map Greek sanctuaries-en.svg|thumb|200px|Delphi among the main Greek sanctuaries]] --&gt;
[[Image:Map Greek sanctuaries Delphi.gif|thumb|'''Delphi'''(left center) is north of the [[Gulf of Corinth]] in central [[Greece]].]]

The site of Delphi is located in lower central Greece, on multiple plateaux/terraces along the slope of [[Mount Parnassus]], and includes the Sanctuary of Apollo, the site of the ancient [[Oracle]]. This semicircular spur is known as [[Phaedriades]], and overlooks the Pleistos Valley. Southwest of Delphi, about {{convert|15|km|mi|abbr=on|lk=off}} away, is the harbor-city of [[Kirrha]] on the [[Corinthian Gulf]].

==Dedication to Apollo==
{{Main|Apollo}}

The name ''Delphoi'' comes from the same root as δελφύς ''delphys'', &quot;womb&quot; and may indicate archaic veneration of [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]], Grandmother [[Earth]], and the [[Earth Goddess]] at the site.&lt;ref&gt;Fontenrose, Joseph, ''The Delphic Oracle: Its Responses and Operations, with a Catalogue of Responses'' (1978). pp. 3&amp;ndash;4. &quot;Such was its prestige that most Hellenes after 500 B.C. placed its foundation in the earliest days of the world: before Apollo took possession, they said, Ge (Earth) (''Gaia'') and her daughter Themis had spoken oracles at Pytho. Such has been the strength of the tradition that many historians and others have accepted as historical fact the ancient statement that Ge and Themis spoke oracles before it became Apollo's establishment. Yet nothing but the myth supports this statement. In the earliest account that we have of the Delphic Oracle's beginnings, the story found in the Homeric Hymn to Apollo (281&amp;ndash;374), there was no [[Oracle]] before Apollo came and killed the great she-dragon, Pytho's only inhabitant. This was apparently the Delphic myth of the sixth century&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
Farnell, Lewis Richard, ''The Cults of the Greek States'', v.III, pp. 8&amp;ndash;10, onwards. &quot;The earth is the abode of the dead, therefore the earth-deity has power over the ghostly world: the shapes of [[dream]]s, which often foreshadowed the future, were supposed to ascend from the world below, therefore the earth-deity might acquire an oracular function, especially through the process of incubation, in which the consultant slept in a holy shrine with his ear upon the ground. That such conceptions attached to Gaia is shown by the records of her cults at Delphi, Athens, and Aegae. A recently discovered inscription speaks of a temple of Ge at Delphi. ... As regards Gaia, we also can accept it. It is confirmed by certain features in the latter Delphic divination, and also by the story of the Python.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Apollo is connected with the site by his [[epithet]] Δελφίνιος ''Delphinios'', &quot;the Delphinian&quot;. The epithet is connected with [[dolphin]]s (Greek δελφίς,-ῖνος) in the [[Homeric hymns|Homeric ''Hymn to Apollo'']] (line 400), recounting the legend of how Apollo first came to Delphi in the shape of a dolphin, carrying [[Crete|Cretan]] priests on his back. The [[Homer]]ic name of the oracle is ''Pytho'' (''Πυθώ'').&lt;ref&gt;[[Odyssey]], VIII, 80&lt;/ref&gt;

Another legend held that Apollo walked to Delphi from the north and stopped at [[Vale of Tempe|Tempe]], a city in [[Thessaly]], to pick laurel, a plant sacred to him (also known in English as the [[Bay laurel|bay tree]]). In commemoration of this legend, the winners at the [[Pythian Games]] received a wreath of laurel (bay leaves) picked in the Temple.

[[Image:Ancient athletics stadium at Delphi.JPG|200px|thumb|View of the mountain-top stadium of the Delphi sanctuary, used for the [[Pythian Games]]. The stone steps/seats at right were added under the Romans.]]

Delphi became the site of a major temple to [[Phoebus Apollo]], as well as the [[Pythian Games]] and the famous prehistoric oracle. Even in Roman times, hundreds of votive statues remained, described by [[Pliny the Younger]] and seen by [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]]. Supposedly carved into the temple were three phrases: {{polytonic|γνῶθι σεαυτόν}} (''gnōthi seautón'' = &quot;[[know thyself]]&quot;) and {{polytonic|μηδέν άγαν}} (''mēdén ágan'' = &quot;nothing in excess&quot;), and  {{polytonic|Ἑγγύα πάρα δ'ἄτη}} (''engýa pára d'atē'' = &quot;make a pledge and [[Atë|mischief]] is nigh&quot;),&lt;ref&gt;Plato, [[Charmides (dialogue)|''Charmides'']] 164d&amp;ndash;165a.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a large letter [[Epsilon|E]].&lt;ref&gt;Hodge, A. Trevor. &quot;The Mystery of Apollo's E at Delphi,&quot; ''American Journal of Archaeology'', Vol. 85, No. 1. (Jan., 1981), pp. 83&amp;ndash;84.&lt;/ref&gt; Among other things epsilon signifies the number [[5 (number)|5]].  [[Plutarch]]'s essay on the meaning of the ''&quot;E at Delphi&quot;'' is the only literary source for the inscription. In ancient times, the origin of these phrases was attributed to one or more of the [[Seven Sages of Greece]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Plato]], [[Protagoras (dialogue)|''Protagoras'']] 343a&amp;ndash;b.&lt;/ref&gt; though ancient as well as modern scholars have doubted the legitimacy of such ascriptions.&lt;ref&gt;H. Parke and D. Wormell, ''The Delphic Oracle'', (Basil Blackwell, 1956), vol. 1, pp. 387&amp;ndash;389.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to one pair of scholars, &quot;The actual authorship of the three maxims set up on the Delphian temple may be left uncertain. Most likely they were popular proverbs, which tended later to be attributed to particular sages.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Parke &amp; Wormell, p. 389.&lt;/ref&gt; 

From a late myth that deviates from much older ones, when young, Apollo killed the chthonic [[serpent (symbolism)|serpent]] [[Python (mythology)|Python]], named Pythia in older myths, but according to some later accounts his wife, [[Pythia]], who lived beside the [[Castalian Spring]], according to some because Python had attempted to rape [[Leto]] while she was pregnant with Apollo and [[Artemis]]. The bodies of the pair were draped around his Rod, which with the wings created the [[caduceus]] symbolic of the god. This spring flowed toward the temple but disappeared beneath, creating a cleft which emitted vapors that caused the Oracle at Delphi to give her prophecies. Apollo killed Python but had to be punished for it, since she was a child of Gaia. The shrine dedicated to Apollo was originally dedicated to Gaia and then possibly to [[Poseidon]]. The name [[Pythia]] remained as the title of the Delphic [[Oracle]]. As punishment for this murder Apollo was sent to serve at menial tasks for eight years. A festival, the Septeria, was performed annually portraying the slaying of the serpent, the flight, the atonement and the return of the God. The Pythian Games took place every four years to commemorate his victory.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Seyffert, ''Dictionary of Classic Antiquities'', [http://www.ancientlibrary.com/seyffert/0178.html article on &quot;Delphic Oracle&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; Another regular Delphi festival was the &quot;[[Theophany|Theophania]]&quot; (Θεοφάνεια), an annual festival in spring celebrating the return of Apollo from his winter quarters in [[Hyperborea]]. The culmination of the festival was a display of an image of the gods, usually hidden in the [[sanctuary]], to worshippers.&lt;ref&gt;James Hall, ''A History of Ideas and Images in Italian Art'', pp 70&amp;ndash;71, 1983, John Murray, London, ISBN 0719539714&lt;/ref&gt;   The &quot;Theoxenia&quot; was held each summer, centred on a feast for &quot;gods and ambassadors from other states&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=EiyDaZ5DWx0C&amp;pg=PA138&amp;dq=Delphi+theoxenia&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=0rrfSeOlJJbyygTwrvjaBA Google books] Stehle, Eva.

[[Erwin Rohde]] wrote that the [[Python (mythology)|Python]] was an earth spirit, who was conquered by Apollo, and buried under the [[Omphalos]], and that it is a case of one deity setting up a temple on the grave of another.&lt;ref&gt;Rodhe, E (1925), &quot;Psyche: The Cult of Souls and the Belief in Immortality among the Greeks&quot;, trans. from the 8th edn. by W.

The [[Etruscans]] coming from northern [[Anatolia]] also worshipped Apollo, and it may be that he was originally identical with [[Mesopotamian mythology|Mesopotamian]] Aplu, an [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] title meaning &quot;son&quot;, originally given to the plague God [[Nergal]], son of [[Enlil]].

==Oracle==
{{main|Pythia}}
[[File:Delphi-2.jpg|thumb|left|View of Delphi.]]

Delphi is perhaps best-known for the [[oracle]] at the sanctuary that was dedicated to Apollo during the classical period. According to [[Aeschylus]] in the prologue of the ''[[Oresteia#The Eumenides|Eumenides]]'', it had origins in prehistoric times and the worship of [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]]. In the last quarter of the 8th century BC there is a steady increase in artifacts found at the settlement site in Delphi, which was a new, post-Mycenaean settlement of the late 9th century. Pottery and bronze work as well as tripod dedications continue in a steady stream, in comparison to [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]]. Neither the range of objects nor the presence of prestigious dedications proves that Delphi was a focus of attention for a wide range of worshippers, but the large quantity of high value goods, found in no other mainland sanctuary, certainly encourages that view.

[[Apollo]] spoke through his oracle: the sibyl or priestess of the oracle at Delphi was known as the [[Pythia]]; she had to be an older woman of blameless life chosen from among the peasants of the area. She sat on a tripod seat over an opening in the earth. When Apollo slew Python, its body fell into this fissure, according to legend, and fumes arose from its decomposing body. Intoxicated by the vapors, the sibyl would fall into a trance, allowing Apollo to possess her spirit. In this state she prophesied. It has been postulated that a gas high in [[ethylene]], known to produce violent trances, came out of this opening, though this theory remains debatable.&lt;ref&gt;See Spiller, Hale, and de Boer (2000).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Roach&gt;{{cite news|title= Delphic Oracle's Lips May Have Been Loosened by Gas Vapors|author=John Roach|publisher=National Geographic|date=2001-08-14|url= http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2001/08/0814_delphioracle.html |accessdate=March 8, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While in a trance the Pythia &quot;raved&quot; &amp;ndash; probably a form of ecstatic speech &amp;ndash; and her ravings were &quot;translated&quot; by the priests of the temple into elegant hexameters. People consulted the Delphic oracle on everything from important matters of public policy to personal affairs. The oracle could not be consulted during the winter months, for this was traditionally the time when Apollo would live among the [[Hyperboreans]]. [[Dionysus]] would inhabit the temple during his absence.&lt;ref&gt;See (e.g.) Fearn 2007, 182.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
H.W. Parke writes that the foundation of Delphi and its oracle took place before recorded history and its origins are obscure, but dating to the worship of the [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]], [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]].&lt;ref&gt;Herbert William Parke, ''The Delphic Oracle'', v.1, p.3. &quot;The foundation of Delphi and its oracle took place before the times of recorded history. It would be foolish to look for a clear statement of origin from any ancient authority, but one might hope for a plain account of the primitive traditions. Actually this is not what we find. The foundation of the oracle is described by three early writers: the author of the ''Homeric Hymn to Apollo'', [[Aeschylus]] in the prologue to the ''Eumenides'', and [[Euripides]] in a chorus in the ''Iphigeneia in Tauris''. All three versions, instead of being simple and traditional, are already selective and tendentious. They disagree with each other basically, but have been superficially combined in the conventional version of late classical times.&quot; Parke goes on to say, &quot;This version [Euripides] evidently reproduces in a sophisticated form the primitive tradition which Aeschylus for his own purposes had been at pains to contradict: the belief that Apollo came to Delphi as an invader and appropriated for himself a previously existing oracle of [[Gaia (mythology)|Earth]]. The slaying of the serpent is the act of conquest which secures his possession; not as in the ''Homeric Hymn'', a merely secondary work of improvement on the site. Another difference is also noticeable. The ''Homeric Hymn'', as we saw, implied that the method of prophecy used there was similar to that of [[Dodona]]: both Aeschylus and Euripides, writing in the fifth century, attribute to primeval times the same methods as used at Delphi in their own day. So much is implied by their allusions to tripods and prophetic seats.&quot; Continuing on p.6, &quot;Another very archaic feature at Delphi also confirms the ancient associations of the place with the Earth goddess. This was the Omphalos, an egg-shaped stone which was situated in the innermost sanctuary of the temple in historic times. Classical legend asserted that it marked the 'navel' (Omphalos) or center of the Earth and explained that this spot was determined by [[Zeus]] who had released two eagles to fly from opposite sides of the earth and that they had met exactly over this place&quot;. On p.7 he writes further, &quot;So Delphi was originally devoted to the worship of the Earth goddess whom the Greeks called Ge, or [[Gaia (mythology)]]. [[Themis]], who is associated with her in tradition as her daughter and partner or successor, is really another manifestation of the same deity: an identity which Aeschylus himself recognized in another context. The worship of these two, as one or distinguished, was displaced by the introduction of Apollo. His origin has been the subject of much learned controversy: it is sufficient for our purpose to take him as the ''Homeric Hymn'' represents him &amp;ndash; a northern intruder &amp;ndash; and his arrival must have occurred in the dark interval between Mycenaean and Hellenic times. His conflict with Ge for the possession of the cult site was represented under the legend of his slaying the serpent.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

The Oracle exerted considerable influence throughout the Greek world, and she was consulted before all major undertakings: wars, the founding of colonies, and so forth. She also was respected by the semi-Hellenic countries around the Greek world, such as [[Lydia]], [[Caria]], and even [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]].  The oracle was also known to the early Romans.  Rome's seventh and last king, [[Lucius Tarquinius Superbus]], after witnessing a snake near his palace, sent a delegation including two of his sons to consult the oracle.&lt;ref&gt;Livy, [[Ab urbe condita (book)|Ab urbe condita]], 1.56&lt;/ref&gt;

:''For a list of some of the most noted oracular pronouncements of the Pythia, go to [[Famous Oracular Statements from Delphi]].

The Oracle benefited from the Macedonian Kings. Later it was placed under the protection of the Aetolians. After a brief period the influence of the Romans started to emerge, and they protected the Oracle from a dangerous barbarian invasion in 109 BC and 105 BC. A major reorganization was initiated, but was interrupted by the [[Mithridatic Wars]] and the wars of [[Sulla]] who took many rich offerings from the Oracle. Invading barbarian invasions burned the Temple, which had been severely damaged by an earthquake in 83 BC. Thus the Oracle fell in decay and the surrounding area became impoverished. The sparse local population led to difficulties in filling the posts required. The Oracle's credibility waned due to doubtful predictions. When [[Nero]] came to Greece in AD 66, he took away over 500 of the best statues from Delphi to Rome. Subsequent Roman emperors of the [[Flavian dynasty]] contributed significantly towards its restoration. [[Hadrian]] offered complete autonomy. Also [[Plutarch]] was a significant factor by his presence as a chief priest. However barbarian raids during the reign of [[Marcus Aurelius]] and removal of statues and other riches (in effect looting) by [[Constantine I]] caused it to decay. The short reign of [[Julian]] could not improve matters. However the Oracle continued until it was closed by emperor [[Theodosius I]] in AD 395. The site was abandoned for almost 100 years, until Christians started to settle permanently in the area: they established the small town of Kastri in about AD 600.

==The &quot;Delphic Sibyl&quot;==
{{Main|Delphic Sibyl}}

The [[Delphic Sibyl]] was a legendary prophetic figure who was said to have given prophecies at Delphi shortly after the [[Trojan War]]. The prophecies attributed to her circulated in written collections of prophetic sayings, along with the oracles of figures such as [[Bakis]]. The Sibyl had no connection to the oracle of Apollo, and should not be confused with the [[Pythia]].&lt;ref&gt;Bowden, Hugh, [http://books.google.com/books?id=SoSJLj3O3tYC&amp;printsec=frontcover ''Classical Athens and the Delphic Oracle. Divination and Democracy'']. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005. ISBN 0-521-53081-4. Cf. p.14. &quot;They may learn about the mysterious Delphic Sibyl, a mythical prophetess unrelated to the traditions of the oracle itself.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buildings and structures==
[[Image:Santuario de Apolo Pitio.gif|thumb|left|200px|Site plan of the Sanctuary of Apollo, Delphi]]

Occupation
e Mycenaean period (1600&amp;ndash;1100 BC). Most of the ruins that survive today date from the most intense period of activity at the site in the 6th century BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;a&quot;&gt;[http://www.ancient-greece.org/archaeology/delphi-archaeology.html Delphi Archaeological Site], Ancient-Greece.org&lt;/ref&gt;

===Temple of Apollo===
The ruins of the Temple of Delphi visible today date from the 4th century BC are of a [[peripteral]] [[Doric order|Doric]] building. It was erected on the remains of an earlier temple, dated to the 6th century BC which itself was erected on the site of a 7th century BC construction attributed to the architects Trophonios and Agamedes.&lt;ref name=&quot;b&quot;&gt;[http://www.ancient-greece.org/architecture/delphi-temple-of-apollo.html Temple of Apollo at Delphi], Ancient-Greece.org&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Delphi tempel.JPG|thumb|200px|Temple of Apollo at Delphi.]]

The 6th century BC temple was named the &quot;Temple of Alcmeonidae&quot; in tribute to the Athenian family which funded its reconstruction following a fire, which had destroyed the original structure. The new building was a Doric [[hexastyle]] temple of 6 by 15 columns. This temple was destroyed in 373 BC by an earthquake with a third temple completed on the site by 330 BC. The third temple is attributed to Corinthian architects Spintharos, Xenodoros, and Agathon.&lt;ref name=&quot;b&quot;/&gt;
[[Image:Columns of the Temple of Apollo at Delphi, Greece.jpeg|thumb|200px|Columns of the Temple of Apollo at Delphi, Greece]]
The [[pediment]] sculptures are a tribute to [[Praxias]] and [[Androsthenes]] of [[Athens]]. Of a similar proportion to the second temple it retained the 6 by 15 column pattern around the [[stylobate]].&lt;ref name=&quot;b&quot;/&gt; Inside was the [[adyton]], the centre of the Delphic oracle and seat of Pythia. The monument was partly restored during 1938(?)&amp;ndash;1300.

The temple survived until 390 AD, when the Christian emperor [[Theodosius I]] silenced the oracle by destroying the temple and most of the statues and works of art in the name of Christianity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ringp185&quot;&gt;Trudy Ring, Robert M. Salkin, Sharon La Bod, ''International Dictionary of Historic Places: Southern Europe''; Page 185; [http://books.google.com/books?id=74JI2UlcU8AC&amp;pg=PA185&amp;dq=Temple+of+Apollo+delphi++theodosius&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=6BgCTKTLFcH68AafmNnBDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Temple%20of%20Apollo%20delphi%20%20theodosius&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; The site was completely destroyed by zealous Christians in an attempt to remove all traces of Paganism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ringp185&quot;/&gt;

===Amphictyonic Council===
The Amphictyonic Council was a council of representatives from six Greek tribes that controlled Delphi and also the quadrennial Pythian Games. They met biannually and came from Thessaly and central Greece. Over time, the town of Delphi gained more control of itself and the council lost much of its influence.

===Treasuries===
[[Image:Treasury of Athens at Delphi.jpg|thumb|200px|The reconstructed Treasury of Athens, built to commemorate their victory at the [[Battle of Marathon]]]]

From the entrance of the site, continuing up the slope almost to the temple itself, are a large number of [[votive deposit|votive]] statues, and numerous treasuries. These were built by the various Greek city states — those overseas as well as those on the mainland — to commemorate victories and to thank the oracle for her advice, which was thought to have contributed to those victories. They are called &quot;treasuries&quot; because they held the offerings made to Apollo; these were frequently a &quot;tithe&quot; or tenth of the spoils of a battle. The most impressive is the now-restored [[Athenian Treasury]], built to commemorate the Athenians' victory at the [[Battle of Salamis]]. According to Pausanias, the Athenians had previously been given the advice by the oracle to put their faith in their &quot;wooden walls&quot; — taking this advice to mean their navy, they won a famous battle at [[Battle of Salamis|Salamis]]. Several of the treasuries can be identified, among them the [[Siphnian Treasury]], dedicated by the city of [[Siphnos]] whose citizens gave a tithe of the yield from their gold mines until the mines came to an abrupt end when the sea flooded the workings.

Other identifiable treasuries are those of the Sikyonians, the Boetians and the Thebans. One of the largest of the treasuries was that of Argos. Built in the late Doric period, the Argives took great pride in establishing their place amongst the other city states. Completed in the year 380, the treasury draws inspiration mostly from the Temple of Hera located in the Argolis, the acropolis of the city. However, recent analysis of the Archaic elements of the treasury suggest that its founding preceded this.

As a result of these treasuries, through the protection of the [[Amphictyonic League]], Delphi came to function as the de-facto [[Central Bank]] of [[Ancient Greece]]. It was the abuse of these treasuries by [[Philip of Macedon]] and the later sacking of the Treasuries, first by the [[Celts]], and later by [[Sulla]], the [[Roman History|Roman]] [[Dictator]], that led to the eclipse of Greek civilization and the eventual growth of Rome.

===Altar of the Chians===
Located in front of the Temple of Apollo, the main altar of the sanctuary was paid for and built by the people of [[Chios]]. It is dated to the 5th century BC by the inscription on its [[cornice]]. Made entirely of black marble, except for the base and cornice, the altar would have made a striking impressions. It was restored in 1920.&lt;ref name=&quot;ministry&quot;&gt;[http://www.culture.gr/2/21/211/21110a/e211ja01.html Delphi], Hellenic Ministry of Culture.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stoa of the Athenians===
The [[stoa]] leads off north-east from the main sanctuary. It was built in the [[Ionic order]] and consists of seven fluted columns, unusually carved from single pieces of stone (most columns were constructed from a series of discs joined together). The inscription on the [[stylobate]] indicates that it was built by the Athenians after their naval victory over the Persians in 478 BC, to house their war trophies.&lt;ref name=&quot;ministry&quot;/&gt; The rear wall of the stoa contains nearly a thousand inscriptions; supposedly any slave manumitted in Athens was obliged to record a short biography here, explaining why he had deserved his freedom.

===Athletic statues===
Delphi is famous for its many preserved athletic statues. It is known that Olympia originally housed far more of these statues, but time brought ruin to many of them, leaving Delphi as the main site of athletic statues.&lt;ref name=&quot;miller98&quot;&gt;Miller, p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kleobis and Biton]], two brothers renowned for their strength, are modeled in two of the earliest known athletic statues at Delphi. The statues commemorate their feat of pulling their mother's cart several miles to the Sanctuary of Hera in the absence of oxen. The neighbors were most impressed and their mother asked Hera to grant them the greatest gift. When they entered Hera's temple, they fell into a slumber and never woke, dying at the height of their admiration, the perfect gift.&lt;ref name=&quot;miller98&quot;/&gt;
The [[Charioteer of Delphi]] is another ancient relic that has withstood the centuries. It is one of the best known statues from antiquity. The charioteer has lost many features, including his chariot and his left arm, but he stands as a tribute to athletic art of antiquity.&lt;ref name=&quot;miller98&quot;/&gt;

===Polygonal wall===
The retaining wall was built to support the terrace housing the construction of the second temple of Apollo in 548 BC. Its name is taken from the [[polygon]]al masonry of which it is constructed.&lt;ref name=&quot;ministry&quot;/&gt;

===Gymnasium===
The [[Gymnasium (ancient Greece)|gymnasium]], which is half a mile away from the main sanctuary, was a series of buildings used by the youth of Delphi. The building consisted of two levels: a [[stoa]] on the upper level providing open space, and a [[palaestra]], pool and baths on lower floor. These pools and baths were said to have magical powers, and imparted the ability to communicate to Apollo himself.&lt;ref name=&quot;ministry&quot;/&gt;

===Hippodrome===
The hippodrome of Delphi was the location where the running events took place during the Pythian Games.  No trace of it has been found, but the location of the stadium and some remnants of retaining walls lead to the conclusion that is was set on a plain apart from the main part of the city and well away from the Peribolos of Apollo.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt;

===Castalian spring===
[[Image:Delphi stadium DSC06305.jpg|thumb|200px|The mountain-top stadium at Delphi, far above the temples/theater below.]]

[[File:Athina Pronaia Sanctuary at Delphi.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Athena Pronaia Sanctuary at Delphi]]

[[Image:Delphi tholos cazzul.JPG|right |thumb| The [[Tholos]] at base of [[Mount Parnassus]]: 3 of 20 [[Doric column]]s.]]

The sacred spring of Delphi lies in the ravine of the Phaedriades. The preserved remains of two monumental fountains that received the water from the spring date to the [[Archaic period in Greece|Archaic]] period and the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]], with the later cut into the rock.

===Stadium===

The [[stadium]] is located further up the hill, beyond the ''via sacra'' and the theatre. It was originally built in the 5th century BC but was altered in later centuries. The last major remodeling took place in the 2nd century AD under the patronage of [[Herodus Atticus]] when the stone seating was built and (arched) entrance. It could seat 6500 spectators and the track was 177 metres long and 25.5 metres wide.&lt;ref name=&quot;d&quot;&gt;[http://www.ancient-greece.org/architecture/delphi-stadium.html Delphi Stadium] at Ancient-Greece.org.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theatre===
The ancient [[theatre]] at Delphi was built further up the hill from the [[Temple of Apollo]] giving spectators a view of the entire sanctuary and the valley below. It was originally built in the 4th century BC but was remodeled on several occasions since. Its 35 rows can seat 5,000 spectators.&lt;ref name=&quot;b&quot;&gt;[http://www.ancient-greece.org/architecture/delphi-theater.html Delphi Theater] at Ancient-Greece.org.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tholos===
The [[Tholos]] at the sanctuary of [[Athena]] Pronaia is a circular building that was constructed between 380 and 360 BC. It consisted of 20 [[Doric order|Doric]] columns arranged with an exterior diameter of 14.76 meters, with 10 [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] columns in the interior. 

The Tholos is located approximately a half a mile (800 m) from the main ruins at Delphi. Three of the Doric columns have been restored, making it the most popular site at Delphi for tourists to take photographs.

[[Vitruvius]] (vii, introduction) notes [[Theodorus the Phocian]] as the architect of the Round Building which is at Delphi.

===Sibyl rock===
The [[Sibyl rock]] is a pulpit-like outcrop of rock between the Athenian Treasury and the [[stoa of the Athenians]] upon the sacred way which leads up to the [[temple of Apollo]] in the archaeological area of Delphi. It is claimed to be where the Sibyl sat to deliver her prophecies.

==Excavations==
The site had been occupied by the village of [[Kastri]] since medieval times.  Before a systematic excavation of the site could be undertaken, the village had to be relocated but the residents understandably resisted. The opportunity to relocate the village occurred when it was substantially damaged by an earthquake, with villagers offered a completely new village in exchange for the old site.&lt;!-- &lt;&lt;== Told by state licenced guide during a tour--&gt; In 1893 the [[French School at Athens|French Archaeological School]] removed vast quantities of soil from numerous landslides to reveal both the major buildings and structures of the sanctuary of Apollo and of Athena Pronaia along with thousands of objects, inscriptions and sculptures.&lt;ref name=&quot;ministry&quot;/&gt;

The whole site is now an archaeological one, and one of the most popular tourist destinations. It is easily accessible from Athens within a day trip, and is often combined with the [[winter sports]] facilities available on Mount Parnassus, as well as the beaches and summer sports facilities of the nearby coast of [[Phocis]]. The site is also protected as a site of extraordinary natural beauty, and the views from it are also [[protected view|protected]]: no industrial artefacts are to be seen from Delphi other than roads and traditional architecture residences (for example HT power lines and the like are routed as to be invisible from the area of the sanctuary).

Modern Delphi is situated immediately west of the archaeological site and hence is a popular tourist destination. It is on a major highway linking [[Amfissa]] along with [[Itea, Greece|Itea]] and [[Arachova]]. There are many hotels and guest houses in the town, and many taverns and bars. The main streets are narrow, and often one-way. Delphi also has a school, a lyceum, a church and a square (''[[plateia]]''). The [[Trans European Footpath E4]] passes through the east end of the town. In addition to the archaeological interest, Delphi attracts tourists visiting the Parnassus Ski Center and the popular coastal towns of the region. 

In [[Middle Ages|medieval times]] Delphi was also called Kastri and was built on the archaeological site. The residents had used the marble columns and structures as support beams and roofs for their improvised houses, a usual way of rebuilding towns that were partially or totally destroyed, especially after the earthquake in 1580, which demolished several towns in Phocis. In 1893 archaeologists from the [[École française d'Athènes]] finally located the actual site&lt;ref&gt;(see [http://google.com/search?q=cache:VBH7i4wfeucJ:www.greeka.com/greece-archaeological-sites.htm+french+archaeological+school+athens+delphi&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=uk&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=2 link])&lt;/ref&gt; of ancient Delphi and the village was moved to a new location, west of the site of the temples.

The [[Delphi Archaeological Museum]] is at the foot of the main archaeological complex, on the east side of the village, and on the north side of the main road. The museum houses an impressive collection associated with ancient Delphi, including the earliest known notation of a melody, the famous Charioteer, golden treasures discovered beneath the Sacred Way, and fragments of reliefs from the Siphnian Treasury. Immediately adjacent to the exit (and overlooked by most tour guides) is the inscription that mentions the Roman proconsul [[Gallio]].

Entries to the museum and to the main complex are separate and chargeable, and a reduced rate ticket gets entry to both. There is a small cafe, and a post office by the museum. Slightly further east, on the south side of the main road, is the [[Gymnasium (ancient Greece)|Gymnasium]] and the [[Tholos]]. Entry to these is free.

==Municipality==
The municipality Delphi was formed at the 2011 local government reform by the merger of the following 8 former municipalities, that became municipal units:&lt;ref name=Kallikratis&gt;[http://www.kedke.gr/uploads2010/FEKB129211082010_kallikratis.pdf Kallikratis law] Greece Ministry of Interior {{el icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The administrative seat of the municipality is in the largest town, Amfissa. The total population of the municipality is 32,263. The town Delphi has a population of 2,373 people while the population of the municipal unit of Delphi, including [[Chrisso, Phocis|Chrisso]] (ancient Krissa), is 3,511.&lt;ref name=Kallikratis/&gt;

'''Digital Equipment Corporation''' was an [[United States|American]] company in the [[computer]] industry and a leading vendor of computer systems, [[software]] and [[computer peripheral|peripherals]] from the 1960s to the 1990s. Also known as '''DEC''' &lt;ref&gt;&quot;DEC used by Digital itself:&quot; ''PDP11 Processor Handbook'' (1973): page 8, &quot;DEC, PDP, UNIBUS are registered trademarks of Digital Equipment Corporation;&quot; page 1-4, &quot;Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) designs and manufactures many of the peripheral devices offered with [[PDP-11]]'s. As a designer and manufacturer of peripherals, DEC can offer extremely reliable equipment... The LA30 DECwriter, a totally DEC-designed and built teleprinter, can serve as an alternative to the Teletype.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; and using the trademark '''DIGITAL''', its [[Programmed Data Processor|PDP]] and [[VAX]] products were arguably the most popular [[minicomputer]]s for the scientific and engineering communities during the 1970s and 1980s.

From 1957 until 1992 its headquarters was located in an old wool mill in [[Maynard, Massachusetts]]. DEC was acquired in June 1998 by [[Compaq]], which subsequently merged with [[Hewlett-Packard]] in May 2002. Some parts of DEC, especially the compiler business and the [[Hudson, Massachusetts]] facility, were sold to [[Intel]].

Digital Equipment Corporation should not be confused with the unrelated companies [[Digital Research|Digital Research, Inc]] or [[Western Digital]] (despite the latter manufacturing the [[LSI-11]] chipsets used in DEC's low end [[PDP-11]]/03 computers).

==Overview==
Initially focusing on the small-end of the computer market allowed DEC to grow without its potential competitors making serious efforts to compete with them. Their PDP series of machines became popular in the 1960s, especially the [[PDP-8]], widely considered to be the first successful [[minicomputer]]. Looking to simplify and update their line, DEC replaced most of their smaller machines with the [[PDP-11]] in 1970, eventually selling over 600,000 units and cementing DECs position in the industry. Originally designed as a follow-on to the PDP-11, DEC's [[VAX|VAX-11]] series was the first widely used [[32-bit]] minicomputer, sometimes referred to as &quot;[[Superminicomputer|superminis]]&quot;. These were able to compete in many roles with larger [[mainframe computer]]s, such as the [[IBM System/370]]. The VAX was a best-seller, with over 400,000 sold, and its sales through the 1980s propelled the company into the second largest in the industry. At its peak, DEC was the second largest employer in Massachusetts, second only to the state government.

The rapid rise of the business [[microcomputer]] in the late 1980s, and especially the introduction of powerful 32-bit systems in the 1990s, quickly eroded the value of DEC's systems. DEC's last major attempt to find a space in the rapidly changing market was the [[DEC Alpha]] [[64-bit]] [[RISC]] [[processor architecture]]. DEC initially started work on Alpha as a way to re-implement their VAX series, but also employed it in a range of high-performance [[workstations]]. Although the Alpha processor family met both of these goals, and, for most of its lifetime, was the fastest processor family on the market, it did little to affect the bottom line or repair the company's status.

The company was acquired in June 1998 by [[Compaq]], in what was at that time the largest merger in the history of the computer industry. At the time, Compaq was focused on the enterprise market and had recently purchased several other large vendors. DEC was a major player overseas where Compaq had less presence. However, Compaq had little idea what to do with its acquisitions, and soon found itself in financial difficulty of its own. The company subsequently merged with [[Hewlett-Packard]] in May 2002. {{As of|2007}} some of DEC's product lines were still produced under the HP name.

==History==
===Origins===
[[Ken Olsen]] and [[Harlan Anderson]] were two engineers who had been working at [[MIT]] [[Lincoln Laboratory]] on the lab's various computer projects. The Lab is best known for their work on what would today be known as &quot;interactivity&quot;, and their machines were among the first where operators had direct control over programs running in real-time. These had started in 1944 with the famed [[Whirlwind (computer)|Whirlwind]] which was originally developed to make a [[flight simulator]] for the [[US Navy]], although this was never completed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mitre.org/news/releases/09/whirlwind_07_01_2009.html &quot;MITRE's Project Whirlwind Computer Collection Transferred to MIT&quot;], MITRE, 1 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, this effort evolved into the [[Semi Automatic Ground Environment|SAGE]] system for the [[US Air Force]], which used large screens and [[light gun]]s to allow operators to interact with [[radar]] data stored in the computer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mitre.org/about/sage.html &quot;Semi-Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE)&quot;], MITRE, 25 January 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Air Force project wound down, the Lab turned their attention to an effort to build a version of the Whirlwind using [[transistor]]s in place of [[vacuum tube]]s. In order to test their new circuitry, they first built a small [[18-bit]] machine known as [[TX-0]] which first ran in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.computerhistory.org/collections/accession/XD154.75 &quot;TX-0 Computer&quot;], Computer History Museum&lt;/ref&gt; When the TX-0 successfully proved the basic concepts, attention turned to a much larger system, the [[36-bit word length|36-bit]] [[TX-2]] with a then-enormous 64 kWords of [[core memory]]. Core was so expensive that parts of TX-0's memory were stripped for the TX-2, and what remained of the TX-0 was then given to [[MIT]] on permanent loan.&lt;ref name=cm&gt;[http://ed-thelen.org/comp-hist/TheCompMusRep/TCMR-V08.html Highlights from ''The Computer Museum Report'' Volume 8 Spring 1984], [[The Computer Museum]], Boston, MA, archived at ed-thelen.org, retrieved 2010-2-19&lt;/ref&gt;

At MIT, Olsen and Anderson noticed something odd: students would line up for hours to get a turn to use the stripped-down TX-0, while largely ignoring a faster [[IBM]] machine that was also available. The two decided that the draw of interactive computing was so strong that they felt there was a market for a small machine dedicated to this role, essentially a commercialized TX-0. They could sell this to users where graphical output or realtime operation would be more important than outright performance. Additionally, as the machine would cost much less than the larger systems then available, it would also be able to serve users that needed a lower-cost solution dedicated to a specific task, where a larger 36-bit machine wouldn't be needed.&lt;ref name=companyhistory/&gt;

In 1957 when the pair and Ken's brother Stan went looking for capital, they found that the American business community was hostile to investing in computer companies. Many smaller computer companies had come and gone in the 1950s, wiped out when new technical developments rendered their platforms obsolete, and even large companies like [[RCA]] and [[General Electric]] were failing to make a profit in the market. The only serious expression of interest came from [[Georges Doriot]] and his [[American Research and Development Corporation]] (AR&amp;D). Worried that a new computer company would find it difficult to arrange further financing, Doriot suggested the fledgling company change its business plan to focus less on computers, and even change their name from &quot;Digital Computer Corporation&quot;.&lt;ref name=companyhistory/&gt;

The pair returned with an updated [[business plan]] that outlined two-phases for the company's development. They would start by selling [[computer module]]s as stand-alone devices that could be purchased separately and wired together to produce a number of different digital systems for lab use. Then, if these &quot;digital modules&quot; were able to build a self-sustaining business, the company would be free to use them to develop a complete computer in their Phase II.&lt;ref name=proposal&gt;[http://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/text/dec/pdp-1/DEC.pdp_1.1957.102664472.pdf &quot;A Proposal to American Research and Development Corporation 27 May 1957&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; The newly christened DEC received $70,000 from AR&amp;D for a 70% share of the company,&lt;ref name=companyhistory/&gt; and began operations in a [[American Civil War|Civil War]] era textile mill in [[Maynard, Massachusetts]], where plenty of inexpensive manufacturing space was available.

===Digital modules===
[[Image:Dec SYSTEM BUILDING BLOCKS 1103.jpg|thumb|System Building Blocks 1103 hex-inverter card (both sides)]]
In early 1958 DEC shipped its first products, the &quot;Digital Laboratory Module&quot; line. The Modules consisted of a number of individual electronic components and [[Bipolar_junction_transistor#Germanium_transistors|germanium transistors]] mounted to a [[circuit board]], the actual circuits being based on those from the TX-2.&lt;ref name=modules&gt;Richard Best, Russell Doane and John McNamara, [http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/gbell/computer_engineering/00000125.htm&quot;Digital Modules, The Basis for Computers&quot;], ''Computer Engineering, A DEC view of hardware systems design&quot;, Digital Press, 1978&lt;/ref&gt;

The Laboratory Modules were packaged in an extruded aluminum housing,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.computerhistory.org/collections/accession/102633142 &quot;DEC Laboratory Module – FLIP-FLOP 201&quot;], Computer History Museum&lt;/ref&gt; intended to sit on an engineer's workbench. They were then connected together using [[4 mm plug|banana plug]] [[patch cord]]s inserted at the front of the modules. Three versions were offered, running at 5&amp;nbsp;MHz (1957), 500&amp;nbsp;kHz (1959), or 10&amp;nbsp;MHz (1960).&lt;ref name=modules&gt;Richard Best, Russell Doane and John McNamara, [http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/gbell/computer_engineering/00000125.htm&quot;Digital Modules, The Basis for Computers&quot;], in ''Computer Engineering, A DEC view of hardware systems design&quot;, Digital Press, 1978&lt;/ref&gt; The Modules proved to be in high demand in other computer companies, who used them to build equipment to test their own systems. Despite the recession of the late 1950s, the company sold $94,000 worth of these modules during 1958 alone, turning a profit at the end of its first year.&lt;ref name=companyhistory/&gt;

The original Laboratory Modules were soon supplemented with the &quot;Digital Systems Module&quot; line, which were identical internally but packaged differently. The Systems Modules were designed with all of the connections at the back of the module using 22-pin Amphenol connectors, and were attached to each other by inserting them into a custom [[19-inch rack]]. These versions allowed 25 modules be to inserted into a single 5-1/4&amp;nbsp;inch section of racking, and allowed the high densities needed to build a computer.&lt;ref name=modules/&gt; DEC used the Systems Modules to build their &quot;Memory Test&quot; machine for testing core memory systems, selling about 50 of these pre-packaged units over the next eight years.&lt;ref name=present3&gt;''Present'' 1978, pg. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

Modules were part of DEC's product line into the 1970s, although they went through several evolutions during this time as technology changed. The same circuits were then packaged as the first &quot;R&quot; (red) series &quot;[[Flip Chip (trademark)|Flip-Chip]]&quot; modules. Later, other module series provided additional speed, much higher logic density, and industrial I/O capabilities.&lt;ref name=present10/&gt; Digital published extensive data about the modules in free catalogs that became very popular.

===PDP-1 family===
[[Image:Vs-dec-pdp-1.jpg|thumb|PDP-1|220px|right|One of the Computer History Museum's [[PDP-1]] systems. This is a canonical example of the type, with the CPU and main control panel on the left, the Type 30 display in the center, and the Soroban typewriter console on the right.]]

With the company established and a successful product on the market, DEC turned its attention to the computer market once again as part of its planned &quot;Phase II&quot;.&lt;ref name=proposal/&gt; In August 1959, Ben Gurley started design of the company's first computer, the [[PDP-1]]. In keeping with Doriot's instructions, the name was an [[initialism]] for &quot;[[Programmable Data Processor]]&quot;, leaving off the term &quot;computer&quot;. As Gurley put it, &quot;We aren't building computers, we're building 'Programmable Data Processors'.&quot; The prototype was first shown publicly at the Joint Computer Conference in Boston in December 1959.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.computerhistory.org/collections/accession/102634161 Eastern Joint Computer Conference and Exhibition], official program of 1959 meeting in Boston&lt;/ref&gt;

The PDP-1 design was based on a number of System Building Blocks packaged into several 19-inch racks to form an [[18-bit]] word computer, supplied standard with 4 kWords of [[core memory]] and running at a basic speed of 100,000 operations per second. The racks were themselves packaged into a single large mainframe case, with a hexagonal control panel containing switches and lights mounted to lay at table-top height at one end of the mainframe. Above the control panel was the system's standard [[input/output]] solution, a [[punch tape]] reader and writer. Most systems were purchased with two [[peripherals]], the Type 30 [[vector graphics]] display, and a [[Soroban Engineering]] modified [[IBM Electric typewriter|IBM Model B Electric typewriter]] that was used as a [[printer (computing)|printer]]. The Soroban system was notoriously unreliable, and often replaced with a modified [[Friden Flexowriter]], which also contained its own punch tape system. A variety of more-expensive add-ons followed, including [[magnetic tape]] systems, [[punched card]] readers and writers, and faster punch tape and printer systems.

The first PDP-1 was delivered to [[Bolt, Beranek and Newman]] in November 1960,&lt;ref&gt;[http://vt100.net/timeline/1960.html &quot;DIGITAL Computing Timeline, 1960&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; and formally accepted the next April.&lt;ref&gt;''Computers and Automation'', April 1961, pg. 8B&lt;/ref&gt; In 1962 DEC donated the prototype PDP-1 to MIT, where it was placed in the room next to the TX-0. In this setting the PDP-1 quickly replaced the TX-0 as the favourite machine among the budding [[Hacker (programmer subculture)|hacker]] culture, and served as the platform for a wide variety of &quot;firsts&quot; in the computing world. Perhaps best known among these is the first computerized video game, ''[[Spacewar!]]'', but among the list are the first [[text editor]], [[word processor]], interactive [[debugger]], the first credible [[computer chess]] program, and some of the earliest computerized music.&lt;ref&gt;Judith Strebel and Rebekah Kim,[http://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/text/FindingAids/102660913.PDP_1.pdf &quot;Guide to the Collection of Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-1 Computer Materials&quot;], Computer History Museum, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The PDP-1 sold in basic form for $120,000, or about $780,000 in 2005-era USD.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.westegg.com/inflation/infl.cgi &quot;Inflation Calculator, 1961–2005&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; BBN's system was quickly followed by orders from [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory|Lawrence Livermore]] and [[Atomic Energy of Canada]] (AECL), and eventually 53 PDP-1s were delivered until production ended in 1969.&lt;ref name=present3/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;History of Computing&quot;, Lexikon Services, ISBN 0944601782&lt;/ref&gt; All of these machines were still being actively used in 1970, and several were eventually saved. MIT's example was donated to [[The Computer Museum, Boston]], and from there ended up at the [[Computer History Museum]] (CHM). A late version of ''Spacewar!'' on paper tape was still tucked into the case. PDP-1 #44 was found in a barn in [[Wichita, Kansas]] in 1988, apparently formerly owned by one of the many aviation companies in the area, and rescued for the Digital Historical Collection, also eventually ending up at the CHM.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Bergin, [http://www.computinghistorymuseum.org/teaching/lectures/pptlectures/10-dec.ppt &quot;Digital Equipment Corporation&quot;], Computer History Museum&lt;/ref&gt; AECLs was sent to [[Science North]], but was later scrapped.

When DEC introduced the PDP-1, they also mentioned larger machines at 24, 30 and 36-bits, based on the same design.&lt;ref&gt;''Datamation'', Volume 5 Number 6 (November/December), pg. 24&lt;/ref&gt; During construction of the prototype PDP-1, some design work was carried out on a 24-bit PDP-2, and the 36-bit PDP-3. Although the PDP-2 never proceeded beyond the initial design, the PDP-3 found some interest and was designed in full.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/29461 &quot;Preliminary Specifications: Programmed Data Processor Model Three (PDP-3)&quot;], DEC, October 1960&lt;/ref&gt; Only one PDP-3 appears to have been built, in 1960, by the CIA's Scientific Engineering Institute (SEI) in [[Waltham, Massachusetts]]. According to the limited information available, they used it to process radar cross section data for the [[Lockheed A-12]] [[reconnaissance aircraft]]. [[Gordon Bell]] remembered that it was being used in [[Oregon]] some time later, but could not recall who was using it.&lt;ref&gt;Posting in [http://www.decconnection.org/announcements.htm &quot;Announcements from The DEC Connection&quot;], ''The DEC Connection'', 14 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1962 DEC introduced the $65,000 [[PDP-4]]. The PDP-4 was similar to the PDP-1 and used a similar instruction set, but used slower memory and different packaging to lower the price. Like the PDP-1, about 54 PDP-4's were eventually sold, most to a customer base similar to the original PDP-1.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon Bell, [http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/gbell/digital/timeline/1962-1.htm &quot;DIGITAL Computing Timeline, 1962, PDP-4&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964 DEC introduced its new [[Flip Chip (trademark)|Flip Chip]] module design, and used it to re-implement the PDP-4 as the [[PDP-7]]. The PDP-7 was introduced in December 1964, and about 120 were eventually produced.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon Bell, [http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/gbell/digital/timeline/1964-3.htm &quot;DIGITAL Computing Timeline, 1964, PDP-7&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; An upgrade to the Flip Chip led to the R series, which in turn led to the PDP-7A in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon Bell, [http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/gbell/digital/timeline/1964-3.htm &quot;DIGITAL Computing Timeline, 1965, PDP-7A&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; The PDP-7 is most famous as the original machine for the [[Unix]] operating system.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Steven Raymond, [http://www.faqs.org/docs/artu/ch02s01.html &quot;Origins and History of Unix, 1969–1995&quot;], 19 September 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

A more dramatic upgrade to the PDP-1 series was introduced in August 1966, the [[PDP-9]].&lt;ref&gt;Gordon Bell, [http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/gbell/digital/timeline/1966-1.htm &quot;DIGITAL Computing Timeline, 1965, PDP-9&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; The PDP-9 was instruction compatible with the PDP-4 and −7, but ran about twice as fast as the −7 and was intended to be used in larger deployments. At only $19,900 in 1968,&lt;ref&gt;DEC Advertisement, ''Chemical and Engineering News'', Volume 46 (1968), pg. 85&lt;/ref&gt; the PDP-9 was a big seller, eventually selling 445 machines, more than all of the earlier models combined.&lt;ref name=miller452&gt;Miller 1997, pg. 452&lt;/ref&gt;

Even while the PDP-9 was being introduced, its replacement was being designed, and was introduced as 1969's [[PDP-15]], which re-implemented the PDP-9 using [[integrated circuits]] in place of modules. Much faster than the PDP-9 even in basic form, the PDP-15 also included a [[floating point unit]] and a separate [[input/output]] processor for further performance gains. Over 400 PDP-15's were ordered in the first eight months of production, and production eventually amounted to 790 examples in 12 basic models.&lt;ref name=miller452/&gt; However, by this time other machines in DEC's lineup could fill the same niche at even lower price points, and the PDP-15 would be the last of the 18-bit series.

===PDP-8 family===
[[Image:PDP-8.jpg|thumb|right|A PDP-8 on display at the [[Smithsonian]]'s [[National Museum of American History]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]. This example is from the first generation of PDP-8s, built with discrete transistors and later known as the ''Straight 8''.]]

In 1962, [[Lincoln Laboratory]] used a selection of System Building Blocks to implement a small 12-bit machine, and attached it to a variety of [[analog-to-digital]] (A to D) [[input/output]] (I/O) devices that made it easy to interface with various analog lab equipment. The [[LINC]] proved to attract intense interest in the scientific community, and has since been referred to as the first real [[minicomputer]],&lt;ref&gt;Wesley Clark, [http://www.historyofscience.com/G2I/timeline/index.php?id=1006 &quot;The Linc, Perhaps the First Mini-Computer&quot;], From Cave Paintings to the Internet&lt;/ref&gt; a machine that was small and inexpensive enough to be dedicated to a single task even in a small lab.

Seeing the success of the LINC, in 1963 DEC took the basic logic design but stripped away the extensive A to D systems to produce the [[PDP-5]]. The new machine, the first outside the PDP-1 mould, was introduced at [[WESTCON]] on 11 August 1963. A 1964 ad expressed the main advantage of the PDP-5, &quot;Now you can own the PDP-5 computer for what a core memory alone used to cost: $27,000&quot;&lt;ref name=faqpdp8&gt;[http://www.faqs.org/faqs/dec-faq/pdp8-models/section-1.html &quot;DEC FAQ: What is a PDP-8?&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; 116 PDP-5s were produced until the lines were shut down in early 1967. Like the PDP-1 before it, the PDP-5 inspired a series of newer models based on the same basic design that would go on to be more famous than its parent.

On 22 March 1965, DEC introduced the [[PDP-8]], which replaced the PDP-5's modules with the new R-series modules using Flip Chips. The machine was re-packaged into a small tabletop case, which remains distinctive for its use of smoked plastic over the CPU which allowed one to easily see the wire-wrapped internals of the CPU. Sold standard with 4 kWords of 12-bit core memory and a [[ASR-33 Teletype]] for basic input/output, the machine listed for only $18,000. The PDP-8 is referred to as the first ''real'' [[minicomputer]] because of its sub-$25,000 price.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/objects/computing_and_data_processing/1982-960.aspx &quot;DEC PDP-8 minicomputer, 1965&quot;], ''The Science Museum''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.computerhistory.org/internet_history/ &quot;Internet History:1965&quot;], Computer History Museum&lt;/ref&gt; Sales were, unsurprisingly, very strong, and helped by the fact that several competitors had just entered the market with machines aimed directly at the PDP-5's market space, which the PDP-8 trounced. This gave the company two years of unrestricted leadership,&lt;ref&gt;''Present'' 1978, pg. 7&lt;/ref&gt; and eventually 1450 &quot;straight eight&quot; machines were produced before it was replaced by newer implementations of the same basic design.&lt;ref name=faqpdp8/&gt;

DEC hit an even lower price-point with the PDP-8/S, the S for &quot;serial&quot;. As the name implies the /S used a serial arithmetic unit, which was much slower but reduced costs so much that the system sold for under $10,000.&lt;ref&gt;''Present'' 1978, pg. 8&lt;/ref&gt; DEC then used the new PDP-8 design as the basis for a new LINC, the two-processor [[LINC-8]]. The LINC-8 used one PDP-8 CPU and a separate LINC CPU, and included instructions to switch from one to the other. This allowed customers to run their existing LINC programs, or &quot;upgrade&quot; to the PDP-8, all in software. Although not a huge seller, 142 LINK-8s were sold starting at $38,500.&lt;ref name=faqpdp8/&gt; Like the original LINC to PDP-5 evolution, the LINC-8 was then modified into the single-processor [[PDP-12]], adding another 1000 machines to the 12-bit family.&lt;ref name=faqpdp8/&gt;&lt;ref name=miller456&gt;Miller 1997, pg. 456&lt;/ref&gt; Newer circuitry designs led to the PDP-8/I and PDP-8/L in 1968.&lt;ref name=present10&gt;''Present'' 1978, pg. 10&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975, one year after an agreement between Digital and [[Intersil]], the [[Intersil 6100]] chip was launched, effectively a PDP-8 on a chip. This was a way to allow PDP-8 software to be run even after the official end-of-life announcement for the Digital PDP-8 product line.

===PDP-10 family===
[[Image:KA10 mod end.jpg|thumb|right|A &quot;B&quot; (blue) series Flip Chip module containing nine transistors, 1971]]

While the PDP-5 introduced a lower-cost line, 1963's [[PDP-6]] was intended to take DEC into the [[Mainframe computer|mainframe]] market with a [[36-bit]] machine. However, the PDP-6 proved to be a &quot;hard sell&quot; with customers, as it offered few advantages over similar machines from the better established vendors like [[IBM]] or [[Honeywell]], in spite of its low cost around $300,000. Only 23 were sold,&lt;ref name=miller457&gt;Miller 1997, pg. 457&lt;/ref&gt; or 26 depending on the source,&lt;ref&gt;Gordon Bell, [http://research.microsoft.com/~gbell/Digital/timeline/1964-1.htm &quot;DIGITAL Computing Timeline, 1964, PDP-6&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; and unlike earlier models the low sales meant the PDP-6 was not improved with intermediate versions. However, the PDP-6 is historically important as the platform that introduced &quot;Monitor&quot;, an early [[time-sharing]] [[operating system]] that would evolve into the widely used [[TOPS-10]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/dec/pdp6/PDP-6_TimsharingBroch.pdf &quot;PDP-6 Timesharing Software&quot;], DEC Publication F-61B&lt;/ref&gt;

In spite of the PDP-6's limited commercial success, it introduced many features that clearly had commercial benefit. When the Flip Chip packaging allowed the PDP-6 to be re-implemented at a much lower cost, DEC took the opportunity to carry out a similar evolution of their 36-bit design and introduced the [[PDP-10]] in 1968. The PDP-10 was as much a success as the PDP-6 was a failure; during its lifetime about 700 mainframe PDP-10s were sold before production ended in 1984.&lt;ref name=miller457/&gt; The PDP-10 was widely used in university settings, and thus was the basis of many advances in computing and operating system design during the 1970s. DEC later re-branded all of the models in the 36-bit series as the &quot;DECsystem-10&quot;, and PDP-10s are generally referred to by the model of their CPU, like &quot;KA10&quot;. Later upgrades produced the compatible [[DECSYSTEM-20]], along with [[TOPS-20]] that included [[virtual memory]].

One of the most unusual peripherals produced for the PDP-10 was the [[DECtape]]. The DECtape was a length of standard magnetic tape wound on 5-in reels. However, the recording format was a 10-track approach using fixed-length numbered 'blocks' organized into a standard file structure, including a directory. Files could be written, read, changed, and deleted on a DECtape as though it were a disk. In fact, some PDP-10 systems had no disks at all, using DECtapes alone for their primary data storage. For greater efficiency, the DECtape drive could read and write to a DECtape in both directions.

===PDP-11===
In 1968 DEC was working on a PDP machine that would be based on 8-bit [[byte]]s instead of 6-bit characters. Known as the &quot;PDP-X&quot;, the project was eventually cancelled. Several team members decamped and set up [[Data General]] in May 1968, and rapidly brought the 16-bit [[Data General Nova|NOVA]] minicomputer to market. DEC immediately found itself behind in the industry transition to 8-bit bytes, and soon lost its crown as the largest minicomputer vendor.

The [[PDP-11]] 16-bit computer was designed in a crash program by Harold McFarland, [[Gordon Bell]], Roger Cady, and others.&lt;ref name=birth&gt;Larry McGowan, [http://hampage.hu/pdp-11/birth.html &quot;How the PDP-11 Was Born (according to Larry McGowan)], 19 August 1998&lt;/ref&gt; The project was able to leap forward in design with the arrival of Harold McFarland, who had been researching 16-bit designs at [[Carnegie Mellon University]]. One of his simpler designs became the PDP-11, although when they first presented it, management was not impressed and almost cancelled it.&lt;ref name=birth/&gt;

In particular, the new design did not include many of the addressing modes that were intended to make programs smaller in memory, a technique that was widely used on other DEC machines and [[CISC]] designs in general. This would mean the machine would spend more time accessing memory, which would slow it down. However, the machine also introduced the idea of &quot;General Registers&quot;, which gave the programmer flexibility to use these high-speed memory caches as they needed, potentially addressing the performance issues.

A major advance in the PDP-11 design was [[UNIBUS]], which supported all peripherals through [[memory mapping]]. This allowed new devices to be added easily, generally only requiring some sort of hardware interface and then writing software that examined the mapped memory to control them. This spawned a huge market of 3rd party add-ons for the PDP-11, which made the machine even more useful.

Its numerous architectural innovations proved superior to all competitors and the &quot;11&quot; architecture was soon the industry leader, propelling DEC back to their leadership position. The design was later expanded to allow [[Paging|paged physical memory]] and [[memory protection]] features, useful for [[multitasking]] and [[time-sharing]], and some models supported separate instruction and data spaces for an effective virtual address size of 128 kB within a physical address size of up to 4 MB. PDP-11s, implemented as single-chip CPUs, continued to be produced until 1996, by which time over 600,000 had been sold.&lt;ref name=miller452/&gt;

The PDP-11 supported several operating systems, including [[Bell Labs|Bell Labs']] new [[Unix]] operating system as well as DEC's [[DOS-11]], [[RSX-11]], IAS, [[RT-11]], DSM-11, and [[RSTS/E]]. Many early PDP-11 applications were developed using standalone paper-tape utilities. DOS-11 was the PDP-11's first disk operating system, but was soon supplanted by more capable systems. RSX provided a general-purpose [[computer multitasking|multitasking]] environment and supported a wide variety of [[programming language]]s. IAS was a [[time-sharing]] version of RSX-11D. Both RSTS and Unix were time-sharing systems available to educational institutions at little or no cost, and these PDP-11 systems were destined to be the sandbox for a generation of engineers and computer scientists. Large numbers of 11/70s were deployed in telecommunications and industrial control applications. AT&amp;T became DEC's largest customer.

RT-11 provided a practical real-time operating system, allowing the PDP-11 to continue Digital's critical role as a computer supplier for [[embedded system]]s. RT-11 served as the inspiration for many microcomputer OS's, as these were generally being written by programmers who cut their teeth on one of the many PDP-11 models. [[CP/M]] used a command syntax similar to RT-11's, and even retained the awkward [[Peripheral Interchange Program|PIP]] program used to copy other programs. DEC's use of &quot;/&quot; for &quot;switches&quot; (command-line options) would lead to the adoption of &quot;\&quot; for pathnames in [[MS-DOS]] and [[Microsoft Windows]] as opposed to &quot;/&quot; in [[Unix]].&lt;ref name=&quot;afu-faq&quot;&gt;[http://www.netwhatever.com/faq/inicio.html#queIII15 alt.folklore.computers List of Frequently Asked Questions]&lt;/ref&gt;

The evolution of the PDP-11 followed earlier systems, eventually evolving into a single-user deskside [[personal computer]] form in the microPDP. 600,000 PDP-11's of all models were eventually sold. Many PDP-11-like machines were also introduced, and a wide variety of peripheral vendors entered the ecosystem. The PDP-11 series was cloned in [[Council for Mutual Economic Assistance|COMECON]] countries as the [[SM EVM]] series, and was produced in quantities comparable to original PDP-11 production.

===VAX===
[[Image:Vax780 small.jpeg|thumb|right|A representative VAX-11/780 system configuration]]

In 1976, DEC decided to extend the [[PDP-11]] architecture to [[32-bit]]s while adding a complete [[virtual memory]] system to the simple paging and memory protection of the PDP-11. The result was the [[VAX]] architecture. The first computer to use a VAX CPU was the [[VAX-11/780]], which DEC referred to as a ''[[superminicomputer]]''. Although it was not the first 32-bit minicomputer, the VAX-11/780's combination of features, price, and marketing almost immediately propelled it to a leadership position in the market after it was released in 1978. VAX systems were so successful that in 1983, DEC canceled its [[Jupiter project]], which had been intended to build a successor to the PDP-10 mainframe, and instead focused on promoting the VAX as their the single computer architecture for the company.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.ca/books?id=W7skAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=dec+Jupiter+project+vax&amp;dq=dec+Jupiter+project+vax&amp;client=safari&amp;cd=4 &quot;The day Jupiter went out of orbit&quot;], ''Electronic Business'', Volume 10 (1984), pg. 76–79&lt;/ref&gt;

Supporting the VAX's success was the [[VT52]], one of the most successful [[smart terminal]]s. Building on earlier less successful models (the [[VT05]] and [[VT50]]), the VT52 was the first terminal that did everything one might want in a single chassis. The VT52 was followed by the even more successful [[VT100]] and its follow-ons, making DEC one of the largest terminal vendors in the industry. With the VT series, DEC could now offer a complete top-to-bottom system from computer to all peripherals, which formerly required collecting the required devices from different suppliers.

The VAX processor architecture and family of systems evolved and expanded through several generations during the 1980s, culminating in the [[NVAX]] [[microprocessor]] implementation and [[VAX 7000/10000]] series in the early 1990s.&lt;ref name=&quot;nvax&quot;&gt;[http://simh.trailing-edge.com/semi/nvax.html DEC Microprocessors: NVAX (1991)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early microcomputers===
The introduction of the first general purpose [[microprocessor]]s inevitably led to the first [[microcomputers]] around 1975. At the time these systems were of limited utility, and Ken Olsen famously derided them in 1977, stating &quot;There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Olsen later claimed he was referring to home automation, see [http://www.snopes.com/quotes/kenolsen.asp &quot;Ken Olsen&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; Unsurprisingly, DEC did not put much effort into the microcomputer area in the early days of the market. At the beginning of the 1980s, DEC built the [[VT180]] (codenamed &quot;Robin&quot;), which was a [[VT100]] terminal with an added [[Zilog Z80|Z80]]-based microcomputer running [[CP/M]], but this product was initially available only to DEC employees.&lt;ref name=Croxton&gt;{{cite web|last=Croxton|first=Greg|title=DEC Robin (VT-180) &amp; documentation|url=http://www.digibarn.com/collections/systems/dec-robin/|work=DigiBarn Computer Museum|accessdate=2011-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was only after IBM had successfully launched the [[IBM PC]] in 1981 that DEC responded with their own systems. In 1982, Digital introduced not one, but three incompatible machines which were each tied to different [[Proprietary hardware|proprietary]] architectures. The first, the [[DEC Professional (computer)|DEC Professional]], was based on the PDP-11/23 (and later, the 11/73) running the [[RSX-11|RSX-11M+]] derived, but menu-driven, P/OS (&quot;Professional Operating System&quot;). This DEC machine easily outperformed the PC, but was more expensive than, and completely incompatible with IBM PC hardware and software, offering far fewer options for customizing a system. In addition, a new user would have to learn an awkward, slow, and inflexible menu-based user interface which appeared to be radically different from [[PC-DOS]] or [[CP/M]], which were more commonly used on the 8080 and 8088 based microcomputers of the time. A second offering, the [[DECmate|DECmate II]] was the latest version of the PDP-8 based word processors, but not really suited to general computing, nor competitive with [[Wang Laboratories]]' popular word processing equipment.

The best known of DEC's early microcomputers was the [[Rainbow 100]], which ran an implementation of [[CP/M-86|CP/M]] on the [[Intel 8086]] processor. Applications from standard CP/M could be re-compiled for the Rainbow, but by this time users were expecting custom-built (pre-compiled binary) applications such as [[Lotus 1-2-3]], which was eventually ported along with [[MS-DOS]] 2.0 and introduced in late 1983. Although the Rainbow generated some press, it was unsuccessful due to its high price and lack of marketing and sales support.&lt;ref name=&quot;rainbow-faq&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=The Rainbow 100 Frequently Asked Questions|url=http://rainbow-100.com/faq/question/1/|work=Drive W|publisher=Approximatrix, LLC|accessdate=15 December 2010|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The way the DEC standard RX50&lt;ref name=Stravers&gt;{{cite web|last=Stravers|first=Kees|title=The RX50 FAQ|url=http://users.bart.nl/users/pb0aia/vax/rx50.html|work=Kees's VAX page|accessdate=2011-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[floppy disk drive]] supported DEC's initial offerings seemed to encapsulate their approach to the personal computer market. Although the mechanical drive hardware was nearly identical to other [[5.25&quot; floppy disk]] drives available on competing systems,&lt;ref name=GeekHist&gt;{{cite web|last=&quot;Geek Historian&quot;|title=MP01482 RX50 EngrDrws Jul82|url=http://www.scribd.com/doc/881906/Tech-History-Digital-Equipment-Corporation-MP01482-RX50-EngrDrws-Jul82|work=Tech History - Digital Equipment Corporation|accessdate=2011-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; DEC sought to differentiate their product by using a proprietary disk format for the data written on the disk. The DEC format had a higher capacity for data, but the RX50 drives were incompatible with other PC floppy drives. This required DEC owners to buy higher-priced, specially-formatted floppy media, which was harder to obtain through standard distribution channels. DEC attempted to enforce exclusive control over its floppy media sales by [[copyright]]ing its proprietary disk format, and requiring a negotiated license agreement and royalty payments from anybody selling compatible media. The proprietary data format meant that RX50 floppies were not interchangeable with other PC floppies, further isolating DEC products from the developing de facto standard PC market. Hardware hackers and DEC enthusiasts eventually reverse-engineered the RX50 format,&lt;ref name=Stravers /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wilson|first=John|title=PUTR.COM V2.01|url=http://www.dbit.com/pub/putr/|accessdate=2011-03-21}} This relatively-recent work is a well-developed example of programs to enhance interchange of data between DEC formatted media and standard PC systems&lt;/ref&gt; but the damage had already been done, in terms of market confusion and isolation.

A further system was introduced in 1986 as the [[VAXmate]], which included [[Microsoft Windows 1.0]] and used [[VAX/VMS]]-based file and print servers along with integration into DEC's own [[DECnet]]-family, providing LAN/WAN connection from PC to mainframe or supermini. The VAXmate replaced the Rainbow, and in its standard form was the first widely marketed diskless workstation.

===Networking and clusters===
In 1984, DEC launched its first 10 Mbit/s Ethernet. Ethernet allowed scalable networking, and [[VAXcluster]] allowed scalable computing. Combined with [[DECnet]] and Ethernet-based terminal servers ([[Local Area Transport|LAT]]), DEC had produced a networked storage architecture which allowed them to compete directly with IBM. Ethernet replaced [[token ring]], and went on to become the dominant networking model in use today.

In September 1985, DEC became the [[List of the oldest currently-registered Internet domain names|fifth company to register]] a [[.com]] [[domain name]] (dec.com).

Along with the hardware and protocols, DEC also introduced the [[VAXcluster]] concept, which allowed several VAX machines to be tied together into a single larger storage system. VAXclusters allowed a DEC-based company to scale their services by adding new machines to the cluster at any time, as opposed to buying a faster machine and using that to replace a slower one. The flexibility this offered was compelling, and allowed DEC to attack high-end markets formerly out of their reach.

===Diversification===
Although their microcomputer efforts were eventually considered failures, the PDP-11 and VAX lines continued to sell in record numbers. Better yet, DEC was competing very well against the market leader, IBM, taking an estimated $2 billion away from them in the mid-80s. In 1986, Digital's profits rose 38 percent when the rest of the computer industry experienced a downturn, and by 1987 the company was threatening IBM's number one position in the computer industry.&lt;ref name=companyhistory&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/digital-equipment-corporation &quot;Digital Equipment Corporation&quot;], ''International Directory of Company Histories'', Volume 6, St. James Press, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

At its peak, Digital was the second-largest computer company in the world, with over 100,000 employees. It was during this time that the company branched out development into a wide variety of projects that were far from its core business in computer equipment. The company invested heavily in custom software. In the 1970s and earlier most software was custom-written to serve a specific task, but by the 1980s the introduction of [[relational databases]] and similar systems allowed powerful software to be built in a modular fashion, potentially saving enormous amounts of development time. Software companies like [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]] became the new darlings of the industry, and DEC started their own efforts in every &quot;hot&quot; niche, in some cases several projects for the same niche. Some of these products competed with DEC's own partners, notably [[Rdb]] which competed with Oracle's products on the VAX, part of a major partnership only a few years earlier.

Although many of these products were well designed, most of them were DEC-only or DEC-centric, and customers frequently ignored them and used third-party products instead. This problem was further exacerbated by Olsen's aversion to traditional advertising and his belief that well-engineered products would sell themselves. Hundreds of millions of dollars were spent on these projects, at the same time that workstations using [[RISC]] microprocessors were starting to approach VAX CPUs in performance.

===Faltering in the market===
As microprocessors continued to improve in the 1980s, it soon became clear that the next generation would offer performance and features equal to the best of DECs low-end minicomputer lineup. Worse, the [[Berkeley RISC]] and [[MIPS architecture|Stanford MIPS]] designs were aiming to introduce 32-bit designs that would outperform the fastest members of the VAX family, DEC's [[cash cow]].&lt;ref&gt;John Hennessy, David Patterson and David Goldberg, [http://books.google.com/books?id=XX69oNsazH4C&amp;pg=PA152 &quot;Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach&quot;], Morgan Kaufmann, 2003, pg. 152&lt;/ref&gt;

Constrained by the huge success of their [[VAX]]/[[OpenVMS|VMS]] products, which followed the proprietary model, the company was very late to respond to these threats. In the early 1990s, DEC found its sales faltering and its first layoffs followed. The company that created the minicomputer, a dominant networking technology, and arguably the first computers for personal use, had abandoned the &quot;low end&quot; market, whose dominance with the PDP-8 had built the company in a previous generation. Decisions about what to do about this threat led to infighting within the company that seriously delayed their responses.

One group suggested that every possible development in the industry be poured into the construction of a new VAX family that would leapfrog the performance of the existing machines. This would limit the market erosion in the top-end segment, where [[profit margin]]s were maximized and DEC could continue to survive as a minicomputer vendor. This line of thought led, eventually, to the [[VAX 9000]] series, which were plagued with problems when they were first introduced in October 1989, already two years late.&lt;ref&gt;John Markoff, &quot;Market Place; Digital Finally Follows a Trend&quot;, ''The New York Times'', 16 July 1990&lt;/ref&gt; The problems took so long to work out, and the prices of the systems were so high, that DEC was never able to make the line the success they hoped.

Others within the company felt that the proper response was to introduce their own RISC designs and use those to build new machines. However, there was little official support for these efforts, and no less than four separate small projects ran in parallel at various labs around the US. Eventually these were gathered into the [[DEC PRISM]] project, which delivered a credible 32-bit design with some unique features allowing it to serve as the basis of a new VAX implementation.&lt;ref&gt;Dileep Bhandarkar et al., [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=63667 &quot;High performance issue oriented architecture&quot;], ''Proceedings of Compcon Spring '90'', pg. 153–160&lt;/ref&gt; Infighting with teams dedicated to DEC's big iron made funding difficult, and the design was not finalized until April 1988, and then cancelled shortly thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Smotherman, [http://www.cs.clemson.edu/~mark/prism.html &quot;PRISM (Parallel Reduced Instruction Set Machine)&quot;], Clemson University School of Computing, October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Another group concluded that new [[workstation]]s like those from [[Sun Microsystems]] and [[Silicon Graphics]] would take away a large part of DEC's existing customer base before the new VAX systems could address the issues, and that the company needed its own Unix workstation as soon as possible. Fed up with slow progress on both the RISC and VAX fronts, a group in [[Palo Alto, California|Palo Alto]] started a [[skunkworks project]] to introduce their own systems. Selecting the MIPS processor, which was widely available, introducing the new [[DECstation]] series with the model 3100 on 11 January 1989.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Furlong et al., [http://www.dtjcd.vmsresource.org.uk/pdfs/dtj_v02-02_1990.pdf &quot;Development of the DECstation 3100&quot;], ''Digital Technical Journal'', Volume 2 Number 2 (Spring 1990), pg. 84–88&lt;/ref&gt; These systems would see some success in the market, but were later displaced by similar models running the Alpha.

===32-bit MIPS and 64-bit Alpha systems===
[[Image:AlphaServer-2100-guts.jpg|thumb|Inside view of AlphaServer 2100.]]

Eventually, in 1992, DEC launched the [[Alpha 21064|DECchip 21064]] processor, the first implementation of their [[DEC Alpha|Alpha]] [[instruction set architecture]], initially named Alpha&amp;nbsp;AXP (the &quot;AXP&quot; was a &quot;non-acronym&quot; and was later dropped). This was a [[64-bit]] [[RISC]] architecture (as opposed to the 32-bit [[Complex instruction set computer|CISC]] architecture used in the VAX) and one of the first &quot;pure&quot; (not an extension of an earlier 32-bit architecture) 64-bit [[microprocessor]] architectures and implementations. The Alpha offered class-leading performance at its launch, and subsequent variants continued to do so into the 2000s. An AlphaServer SC45 supercomputer was still ranked #6 in the world in November 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.top500.org/lists/2004/11 www.top500.org Top 10 Supercomputing Sites, November 2004]&lt;/ref&gt; Alpha-based computers (the DEC AXP series, later the [[AlphaStation]] and [[AlphaServer]] series) superseded both the VAX and MIPS architecture in DEC's product lines, and could run [[OpenVMS]], DEC [[OSF/1]] AXP (later, Digital Unix or Tru64 UNIX) and Microsoft's then-new operating system, [[Windows NT]].

In 1998, following the takeover by Compaq Computers, a decision was made that Microsoft would no longer support and develop Windows NT for the Alpha series computers, a decision that was seen as the beginning of the end for the Alpha series computers.

DEC tried to compete in the Unix market by adding [[POSIX]]-compatibility features to the VAX/VMS operating system (becoming &quot;OpenVMS&quot;) and by selling its own version of Unix ([[Ultrix]] on PDP-11, VAX and MIPS architectures; OSF/1 on Alpha), and began to advertise more aggressively. DEC was simply not prepared to sell into a crowded Unix market however, and the low end PC-servers running NT (based on [[Intel]] processors) took market share from Alpha-based computers. DEC's workstation and server line never gained much popularity beyond former DEC customers.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

===StrongARM===
In the mid-1990s, Digital Semiconductor collaborated with [[ARM Limited]] to produce the [[StrongARM]] microprocessor. This was based in part on ARM7 and in part on DEC technologies like Alpha, and was targeted at [[embedded system]]s and portable devices. It was highly compatible with the ARMv4 architecture and was very successful, competing effectively against rivals such as the [[SuperH]] and [[MIPS architecture]]s in the [[portable digital assistant]] market. [[Microsoft]] subsequently dropped support for these other architectures in their [[Pocket PC]] platform. In 1997, as part of a lawsuit settlement, the [[StrongARM]] intellectual property was sold to [[Intel]]. They continued to produce [[StrongARM]], as well as developing it into the [[XScale]] architecture. Intel subsequently sold this business to [[Marvell Technology Group]] in 2006.

===Designing solutions===
Beyond DECsystem-10/20, PDP, VAX and Alpha, Digital was well respected for its communication subsystem designs, such as Ethernet, DNA (Digital Network Architecture – predominantly DECnet products), DSA (Digital Storage Architecture – disks/tapes/controllers), and its &quot;dumb terminal&quot; subsystems including VT100 and DECserver products.&lt;ref&gt;For in-depth articles regarding Digital technologies, refer to the archived [http://www.hpl.hp.com/hpjournal/dtj/past.htm Digital Technical Journal]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Final years===
[[Image:Digital Equipment Corporation 1993 logo.png|New 1993 corporate logo|thumb]]
In June 1992, [[Ken Olsen]] was replaced by [[Robert Palmer (computer businessman)|Robert Palmer]] as the company's president. Digital's board of directors also granted Palmer the title of chief executive officer (&quot;CEO&quot;), a title that had never been used during Digital's 35-year existence. Palmer had joined DEC in 1985 to run Semiconductor Engineering and Manufacturing. His relentless campaign to be CEO, and success with the Alpha microprocessor family, made him a candidate to succeed Olsen. At the same time a more modern logo was designed&lt;ref&gt;[[Ned Batchelder]] and [http://vt100.net/dec/logo Vt100.net].&lt;/ref&gt;

During the profitable years up until the early 1990s, DEC was a company that boasted that it never had a general layoff;&lt;ref&gt;Schein, ''et al'', pp. 67, 109.&lt;/ref&gt; following the 1992 economic downturn, layoffs became regular events as the company continually downsized to try to stay afloat.&lt;ref&gt;Schein, ''et al'', p. 233.&lt;/ref&gt; Palmer was tasked with the goal of bringing DEC back to profitability, which he attempted to do by changing the established DEC business culture, hiring new executives from outside the company, and selling off various non-core business units:&lt;ref&gt;Schein, ''et al'', pp. 128, 144, 234.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Worldwide training was spun off to form an independent/new company called Global Knowledge Network.
* [[Oracle Rdb|Rdb]], DEC's database product, was sold to [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]].
* Rights to the [[PDP-11]] line and several PDP-11 operating systems were sold to Mentec in 1994, though DEC continued to produce some PDP-11 hardware for a few years.&lt;ref&gt;http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20060813131029/http://www.mentec-inc.com/&lt;/ref&gt;
* Disk and [[Digital Linear Tape|DLT]] technologies was sold to [[Quantum Corporation]] in 1994, immediately propelling Quantum to the No1 spot in disk manufacturing.
* [[Text terminal]] business ([[VT100]] and its successors) was sold in August 1995 to [[Boundless Technologies]].
* [[CORBA]]-based product, ObjectBroker, and its messaging software, MessageQ, were sold to [[BEA Systems|BEA Systems, Inc]] in March 1997.
* In May 1997, DEC sued [[Intel]] for allegedly infringing on its Alpha patents in designing the [[Original Intel Pentium (P5 microarchitecture)|original Pentium]], [[Pentium Pro]], and [[Pentium II]] chips.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;DEC, Cyrix sue Intel&quot;, by Gale Bradley and Jim Detar, ''Electronic News'' '''43''', #2168 (May 19, 1997), ISSN 1061-6624.&lt;/ref&gt; As part of a settlement, much of DEC's chip design and fabrication business was sold to Intel. This included DEC's [[StrongARM]] implementation of the [[ARM architecture|ARM computer architecture]], which Intel marketed as the [[Intel XScale|XScale]] processors commonly used in [[Pocket PC]]s. The core of Digital Semiconductor, the Alpha microprocessor group, remained with DEC, while the associated office buildings went to Intel as part of the Hudson, Mass. fabrication site.
* Printer business was sold in 1997 to [[GENICOM]] (now TallyGenicom), which then produced models bearing the Digital logo.
* Networking business was sold c.1997 to [[Cabletron Systems]], and subsequently spun off as [[Digital Network Products Group]].
* [[DECtalk]] and [[DECvoice]] voice products were spun off, and eventually arrived at [[Fonix]].

By 1997 Digital had subsidiary companies in more than two dozen countries including Austria, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China (People's Republic), Colombia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Israel, Japan, Jersey States, New Zealand, Netherlands, Norway, Russia, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.secinfo.com/dsvRx.83Pe.7.htm SEC Web site] retrieved January 22, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, on January 26, 1998, what remained of the company (including Digital's multivendor global services organization and customer support centers) was sold to [[Compaq]], which was acquired by [[Hewlett-Packard]] in 2002. The remainder of Digital Semiconductor (the Alpha microprocessor group) was sold to Intel, which placed those employees back in their Hudson, Mass. office which they had vacated when the site was sold to Intel in 1997. Compaq, and later HP, continued to sell many of the former Digital products but rebranded with their own logos. For example, HP now sells what were formerly Digital's StorageWorks disk/tape products,&lt;ref&gt;[http://h18006.www1.hp.com/storage/ HP StorageWorks – Data and Network Storage Products and Solutions&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; as a result of the Compaq acquisition.

The Digital logo survived for a while after the company ceased to exist, as the logo of Digital GlobalSoft, an IT services company in India (which was a 51 percent subsidiary of Compaq). Digital GlobalSoft was later renamed &quot;HP GlobalSoft&quot; (also known as the &quot;HP Global Delivery India Center&quot; or HP GDIC) and no longer uses the Digital logo.

The digital.com and DEC.com domain names are now owned by Hewlett-Packard and redirect to their US website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digital.com/ Digital.com], [http://www.Dec.com/ DEC.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Digital once held the [[Classful network|Class A]] [[IP address]] block 16.0.0.0/8.

The [[Digital Federal Credit Union]] (DCU, now DFCU), which was chartered in 1979 for employees of DEC, is now open to essentially everyone. DFCU has over 700 different sponsors, including the companies that acquired pieces of DEC.

==Research==
DEC's Research Laboratories (or Research Labs, as they were commonly known) conducted Digital's corporate research. Some of them were operated by [[Compaq]] and are still operated by [[Hewlett-Packard]]. The laboratories were:

* [[Western Research Laboratory]] (WRL) in [[Palo Alto, California]], USA
* [[DEC Systems Research Center|Systems Research Center]] (SRC) in [[Palo Alto, California]], USA
* [[Network Systems Laboratory]] (NSL) in [[Palo Alto, California]], USA
* [[Cambridge Research Laboratory]] (CRL) in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], USA
* [[Paris Research Laboratory]] (PRL) in [[Paris, France]]
* [[MetroWest Technology Campus]] (MTC) in [[Maynard, Massachusetts]], USA

Some of the former employees of Digital's Research Labs or Digital's R&amp;D in general include:

* [[Gordon Bell]]
* [[Leonard Bosack]]
* [[Henry Burkhardt III]], co-founder of [[Data General|Data General Corporation]] and [[Kendall Square Research]]
* [[Michael Burrows|Mike Burrows]]
* [[Luca Cardelli]]
* [[Dave Cutler]]
* [[Edson deCastro|Ed deCastro]], co-founder of [[Data General|Data General Corporation]]
* [[Jim Gettys]]
* [[Henri Gouraud (computer scientist)|Henri Gouraud]]
* [[Jim Gray (computer scientist)|Jim Gray]]
* [[Alan Kotok]]
* [[Leslie Lamport]]
* [[Butler Lampson]]
* [[Louis Monier]]
* [[Isaac Nassi]]
* [[Radia Perlman]]
* [[Marcus J. Ranum|Marcus Ranum]]
* [[Brian Reid (computer scientist)|Brian Reid]]
* [[Paul Vixie]]

Some of the work of the Research Labs was published in the ''Digital Technical Journal'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hpl.hp.com/hpjournal/dtj/past.htm Digital Technical Journal – Online Issues]&lt;/ref&gt; which was in published from 1985 until 1998.&lt;ref&gt;At least some of the research reports are available online at [ftp://ftp.digital.com/pub/DEC/ ftp.digital.com], in the subdirectories WRL, SRC, NSL, CRL, PRL (see [[Digital Equipment Corporation#Research|Research]] section). Verified July 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accomplishments==
Digital supported the [[American National Standards Institute|ANSI]] standards, especially the [[ASCII]] character set, which survives in [[Unicode]] and the [[ISO 8859]] character set family. Digital's own [[Multinational Character Set]] also had a large influence on [[ISO 8859-1]] (Latin-1) and, by extension, [[Unicode]].

The first versions of the [[C (programming language)|C]] language and the [[Unix]] operating system ran on Digital's [[Programmed Data Processor|PDP]] series of computers (first on a PDP-7, then the [[PDP-11]]'s), which were among the first commercially viable [[minicomputer]]s, although for several years Digital itself did not encourage the use of Unix.

Digital also produced the popular [[VAX]] computer family, the first pure 64-bit microprocessor architecture ([[DEC Alpha|Alpha AXP]]), the first commercially successful workstation (the VT-78), and some commercially unsuccessful personal computers. The central computing system of the Soviet reusable [[Buran (spacecraft)|Buran]] spaceship was based on two MicroVAX computers.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

Digital produced widely used interactive operating systems, including [[OS/8|OS-8]], [[TOPS-10]], [[TOPS-20]], [[RSTS/E]], [[RSX-11]], [[RT-11]], and [[OpenVMS]]. PDP computers, in particular the [[PDP-11]] model, inspired a generation of programmers and software developers. Some [[PDP-11]] systems more than 25 years old (software and hardware) are still being used to control and monitor factories, transportation systems and nuclear plants. Digital was an early champion of [[time-sharing]] systems.

Digital was to the command-line interface (CLI) what Apple was to the GUI {{Dubious|date=March 2009}}: there was history before and innovation after, but it was Digital's operating systems that put it together in a complete and definitive form {{Dubious|date=March 2009}}. The command-line interfaces found in Digital's systems, eventually codified as [[DIGITAL Command Language|DCL]], would look familiar to any user of modern microcomputer CLIs; those used in earlier systems, such as [[Compatible Time-Sharing System|CTSS]], [[IBM]]'s [[Job Control Language|JCL]], or [[Univac]]'s time-sharing systems, would look utterly alien. Many features of the CP/M and MS-DOS CLI show a recognizable family resemblance to Digital's OSes, including command names such as DIR and HELP and the &quot;name-dot-extension&quot; file naming conventions.

VAX and [[MicroVAX]] computers (very widespread in the 1980s) running [[Virtual Memory System|VMS]] formed one of the most important proprietary networks, [[DECnet]], which linked business and research facilities. The [[DECnet]] protocols formed one of the first peer-to-peer networking standards, with DECnet phase I being released in the mid-1970s. Email, file sharing, and distributed collaborative projects existed within the company long before their value was recognized in the market.

Digital, Intel and Xerox through their collaboration to create the DIX standard, were champions of [[Ethernet]], but Digital is the company that made Ethernet commercially successful. Initially, Ethernet-based DECnet and [[Local Area Transport|LAT]] protocols interconnected VAXes with DECserver terminal servers. Starting with the UNIBUS to Ethernet adapter, multiple generations of Ethernet controllers from Digital were the de facto standard. The CI &quot;computer interconnect&quot; adapter was the industry's first network interface controller to use separate transmit and receive &quot;rings&quot;.

Digital also invented [[Computer cluster|clustering]], an operating system technology that treated multiple machines as one logical entity. Clustering permitted sharing of pooled disk and tape storage via the HSC50/70/90 and later series of Hierarchical Storage Controllers. HSCs delivered the first hardware RAID 0 and 1 capabilities and the first serial interconnects of multiple storage technologies. This technology was the forerunner to systems like [[Network of Workstations]] which are used for massively cooperative tasks such as web-searches and drug research.

The LA36 and LA120 dot matrix printers became industry standards and may have hastened the demise of the [[teleprinter|Teletype Corporation]].

The [[VT100]] [[computer terminal]] became the industry standard, implementing a useful subset of the [[ANSI X3.64]] standard, and even today terminal emulators such as [[HyperACCESS|HyperTerminal]], [[PuTTY]] and [[Xterm]] still emulate a VT100 (or its more capable successor, the [[VT220]]).

The [[X Window System]], the network transparent window system used on UNIX and Linux, and also available on other operating systems, was developed at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] jointly between [[Project Athena]] and the [[Laboratory for Computer Science]]. Digital was the primary sponsor for this project, which was one of the first large scale free software projects,{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}&lt;!-- need reliable sources for &quot;one of the first&quot;, and &quot;free software&quot;, the latter since &quot;free&quot; was perhaps not an original goal --&gt; a contemporary of the [[GNU Project]] but not associated with it.

[[Dave Cutler]], who led the development of [[RSX-11]]M, [[RSX-11]]M+, [[Virtual Memory System|VMS]] and then [[VAXeln]], left Digital in 1988 to lead the development of [[Windows NT]] which was initially intended to be an &quot;open&quot; [[operating system]] that would run on more powerful processors than the existing predominant [[x86]] architecture. While DEC did see value in continuing its [[X Window System]] environment to support engineering customers, it understood that future mid-range based customers would demand a faster and more user friendly [[Graphical User Interface]] (GUI), potentially offered through the Windows environment.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} As Microsoft had experience, technology and patents that would give them upper hand in advancing GUI technology, DEC opted to partner with Microsoft's development of Windows NT for mid-range processors and share in the R&amp;D process of creating faster computers using their [[RISC]] [[DEC Alpha|Alpha]] processors.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} Microsoft was not exclusively bound to the Alpha chip so it pursued other processor makers such as IBM with the [[PowerPC]] architecture and eventually capitalized on the emerging strength of the Intel x86 based processors. While most would say that the market determined its own course through the more cost efficient processors produced by Intel, DEC quickly came to realize that its loose partnership with Microsoft would lead to its own undoing in terms of being a major player in the mid-range processor market.

Notes-11 and its follow-on product, VAXnotes, were two of the first examples of online collaboration software, a category that has become to be known as [[Collaborative software|groupware]]. [[Len Kawell]], one of the original Notes-11 developers later joined [[Lotus Development Corporation]] and contributed to their [[Lotus Notes]] product.

Digital was one of the first businesses connected to the [[Internet]] with ''dec.com'', registered in 1985,&lt;ref&gt;[http://research.microsoft.com/Users/gbell/Digital/timeline/1985-6.htm dec.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; being one of the first of the now ubiquitous ''.com'' domains. ''gatekeeper.dec.com'' was a well-known software repository during the pre-[[WWW|World Wide Web]] days, and Digital was also the first computer vendor to open a public website, on October 1, [[1993]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9402&amp;L=dectei-l&amp;T=0&amp;P=200 DECTEI-L Archives – February 1994 (#2)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The popular [[AltaVista]], created by Digital, was one of the first comprehensive Internet [[Search engine (computing)|search engine]]s. (Although [[Lycos]] was earlier, it was much more limited.)

DEC invented [[Digital Linear Tape]] (DLT), formerly known as CompacTape, which began as a compact backup medium for MicroVAX systems, and later grew to capacities of 800 gigabytes.

Work on the first hard-disk-based [[MP3]]-player, the [[Personal Jukebox]], started at the [[DEC Systems Research Center]]. (The project was started about a month before the merger into [[Compaq]] was completed.)

DEC's Western Research Lab created the [[Itsy Pocket Computer]]. This was developed into the Compaq [[iPaq]] line of [[Personal digital assistant|PDA]]s, which replaced the [[Compaq Aero]] PDA.

==User organizations==
Originally the [[users' group]] was called [[DECUS]] (Digital Equipment Computer User Society) during the 1960s to 1990s. When [[Compaq]] acquired Digital in 1998, the users group was renamed CUO, the Compaq Users' Organisation. When [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]] acquired [[Compaq]] in 2002, CUO became [[HP-Interex]], although there are still DECUS groups in several countries. In the [[United States]], the organization is represented by the [[Encompass]] organization.

'''Dead Kennedys''' are an American [[punk rock]] band formed in [[San Francisco]], [[California]] in 1978. The band are pioneers of [[hardcore punk]] during the 1980s. They gained a large [[Underground music|underground]] fanbase in the international punk music scene.

Their music mixed the more experimental elements of British 1970s punk with the raw energy of the 1980s American hardcore punk scene. Dead Kennedys' songs mixed deliberately extreme lyrics with [[satire]], [[sarcasm]], and [[irony]] of social and political issues of the 1980s.

In the late 1980s, the band was embroiled in an obscenity trial in the United States over the artwork of their album ''[[Frankenchrist]]'' (1985), which included the explicit titular subject of [[H. R. Giger]]'s ''[[Penis Landscape]]''. The band was charged with distribution of harmful matter to minors, but the trial ended with a [[hung jury]].

Dead Kennedys released five studio albums before disbanding in 1986. In 2001, the band reformed without original singer [[Jello Biafra]], who had been in a legal dispute with the other members over royalties.

The band played three performances in October 2010.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.livenation.com/Dead-Kennedys-tickets/artist/842801?tm_link=edp_Artist_Name&lt;/ref&gt; At one of the concerts, they debuted their first new song since 1986, &quot;You're Such a Fake&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;newmaterial&quot;&gt;[http://dcheavymetal.com/2010/10/18/a-post-about-the-dead-kennedys A Post About The Dead Kennedys]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the dissolution of Dead Kennedys, Biafra has continued to collaborate and record with other artists, including [[Mojo Nixon]], [[Al Jourgensen]] of [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]], and the [[Melvins]], and has become a [[spoken word]] performer, covering political topics in particular.

==History==
===Formation of the band (1978)===
Dead Kennedys formed in June 1978 in [[San Francisco, California]], when [[East Bay Ray]] (Raymond Pepperell) advertised for bandmates in the newspaper ''[[The Recycler]]'', after seeing a [[ska-punk]] show at [[Mabuhay Gardens]] in San Francisco. The original band lineup consisted of [[Jello Biafra]] (Eric Reed Boucher) on vocals, East Bay Ray on guitar, [[Klaus Flouride]] (Geoffrey Lyall) on bass, and [[6025 (musician)|6025]] (Carlos Cadona) on drums and percussion. This lineup recorded their [[The 1978 Demos|first demos]]. In early July, the band wanted a more experienced drummer, so they recruited [[Ted (musician)|Ted]] (Bruce Slesinger). 6025 left the band, however he was invited back as secondary guitarist. Their first show was on July 19, 1978, at the Mabuhay Gardens in San Francisco, California.

Dead Kennedys played numerous shows at local venues afterwards. Due to the provocative name of the band, they sometimes played under [[pseudonym]]s, including &quot;The Sharks&quot;, &quot;The Creamsicles&quot; and &quot;The Pink Twinkies&quot;. The name generated controversy. Wrote ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' columnist [[Herb Caen]] in November 1978, &quot;Just when you think tastelessness has reached its nadir, along comes a punk rock group called The Dead Kennedys, which will play at [[Mabuhay Gardens]] on Nov. 22, the 15th anniversary of John F. Kennedy's assassination. Despite mounting protests, the owner of Mabuhay says 'I can't cancel them NOW &amp;mdash; there's a contract.' Not, apparently, the kind of contract some people have in mind.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Caen, Herb (November 17, 1978) &quot;On the Rotunda.&quot; ''San Francisco Chronicle.''&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite popular belief, the name was not meant to insult the [[Kennedy family]], but to quote Biafra, &quot;to bring attention to the end of the American Dream&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Pfeiffer.&lt;/ref&gt; 6025 left the band in March 1979. In June, the band released their first single, &quot;[[California Über Alles]]&quot;, on the [[independent label]] [[Alternative Tentacles]]. The band followed with a well received [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] tour.

===Disruption of music awards show (1980)===
{{Details|Pull My Strings}}
&lt;!-- Commented out: [[Image:Pullmystrings.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Dead Kennedys at the Bay Area Music Awards]] --&gt;On March 25, 1980, Dead Kennedys were invited to perform at the Bay Area Music Awards in San Francisco to major record label artists to give the event some &quot;New Wave credibility&quot;, in the words of the organizers. The day of the performance was spent practicing the song they were asked to play, the underground hit, &quot;California Über Alles&quot;. In typically [[Subversion (political)|subversive]], perverse style, the band became the talking point of the ceremony when after about 15 seconds into the song, Biafra said, &quot;Hold it! We've gotta prove that we're adults now. We're not a punk rock band, we're a [[New Wave music|new wave]] band.&quot;

The band, who all wore white shirts with a big, black S painted on the front, pulled black ties from around the backs of their necks to form a dollar sign, then started playing a new song entitled &quot;Pull My Strings&quot;, a barbed, [[Satire|satirical]] attack on the ethics of the mainstream music industry, which contained the lyrics, &quot;Is my cock big enough, is my brain small enough, for you to make me a star?&quot;. The song also referenced [[The Knack]]'s song &quot;[[My Sharona]]&quot;. &quot;Pull My Strings&quot; was never recorded for a studio release, though the performance at the Bay Area Music Awards, which was the first and only time the song was ever performed, was released on the band's compilation album ''[[Give Me Convenience or Give Me Death]]''.

===&quot;Holiday in Cambodia&quot; and ''Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables'' (1980–1981)===
In early 1980, they recorded and released the single &quot;[[Holiday in Cambodia]]&quot;. Later that year, the band released their debut album, ''[[Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables]]''. The album reached number 33 on the [[UK Albums Chart]]. In January 1981, Ted announced that he wanted to leave to pursue a career in architecture and would help look for a replacement. He played his last concert in February of 1981. His replacement was [[D.H. Peligro]] (Darren Henley).

Around the same time, East Bay Ray had tried to pressure the rest of the band to sign to the major record label [[Polydor Records]]; Biafra stated that he was prepared to leave the group if the rest of the band wanted to sign to the label,&lt;ref name=&quot;polydor&quot;&gt;Nardwuar the Human Serviette, December 2005 interview with Jello Biafra and The Melvins, as reproduced in [http://www.alternativetentacles.com/batcasts/batcast-013-2006_04_25.m4a Alternative Tentacles Batcast #15, April 25, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; though East Bay Ray asserts that he recommended against signing with Polydor. Polydor decided to not sign the band after they learned that the Dead Kennedys were planning their next single to be &quot;[[Too Drunk to Fuck]]&quot;.

In May, the band released the single &quot;Too Drunk to Fuck&quot;. The song caused much controversy in the UK as BBC feared the single would reach the Top 30; this would require a mention of the song on ''[[Top of the Pops]]''. However, this never came to be as the single peaked at number 36.

===''In God We Trust, Inc.'', ''Plastic Surgery Disasters'' and Alternative Tentacles Records (1981–1985)===
After Peligro's joined the band, the extended play ''[[In God We Trust, Inc.]]'' (1981) saw them moving toward full on hardcore/thrash. In addition to the EP's controversial artwork depicting a gold Christ figure on a cross of dollar bills, the lyrics contained Biafra's most biting social and political commentary yet, and songs such as &quot;[[Moral Majority]]&quot;, &quot;[[Nazi Punks Fuck Off!]]&quot; and &quot;[[We've Got a Bigger Problem Now]]&quot; placed the Dead Kennedys as the leaders of a social movement, while &quot;Dog Bite&quot;, a cover version of ''[[Rawhide (song)|Rawhide]]'' and various joke introductions showed a much more whimsical side. In 1982, they released their second studio album, ''[[Plastic Surgery Disasters]]''. The album's cover features a withered starving African child's hand being held and dwarfed by a white man's hand. This picture won the World Press Photo award in 1980, and was taken in Karamoja district in [[Uganda]] by Mike Wells.

The band's music had evolved much in a short time, moving away from hardcore formulas toward a more innovative jazz-informed style, featuring musicianship and dynamics far beyond other bands in the genre. By now the group had become a de-facto political force, pitting itself against rising elements of American social and political life such as the religious right, Ronald Reagan and the idle rich. The band continued touring all over the United States, as well as Europe and Australia, and gained a large underground following. While they continued to play live shows during 1983 and 1984, they took a break from releasing new records to concentrate on the [[Alternative Tentacles]] record label, which would become synonymous with DIY alternative culture. The band continued to write and perform new material during this time, which would appear on their next album (some of these early performances can be seen in the ''[[Live at DMPO's on Broadway]]'' video, originally released by [[Dirk Dirksen]] and later reissued on Rhino).

===''Frankenchrist'' and obscenity trial (1985–1986)===
The release of the album ''[[Frankenchrist]]'' in 1985 showed the band had grown in terms of musical proficiency and lyrical maturity.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} While there were still a number of loud/fast songs, much of the music featured an eclectic mix of instruments including trumpets and synthesizers. Around this time [[Klaus Flouride]] released the similarly experimental solo EP ''[[Cha Cha Cha With Mr. Flouride]]''. Lyrically, the band continued their trademark social commentary, with songs such as &quot;[[M.T.V. − Get off the Air|MTV Get Off The Air]]&quot; and &quot;[[Jock-o-rama]]&quot; poking fun at mainstream America. In some ways the album represented an artistic peak.

However, the album also heralded in an era of prolonged legal trouble for the band. The artwork caused a furor with the newly formed Parents Music Resource Center ([[PMRC]]). In December 1985 a teenage girl purchased the album at the Wherehouse Records store in [[Los Angeles, CA|Los Angeles County]].&lt;ref name=WishniaNation&gt;Wishnia, Steven. &quot;Of Punk and Pornography: Rockin' With the First Amendment&quot;. ''The Nation''. October 24, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; The girl's mother wrote letters of complaint to the [[California Attorney General]] and to Los Angeles [[prosecutors]].&lt;ref name=WishniaNation/&gt;  In 1986 members of the band, along with other parties involved in the distribution of ''Frankenchrist'', were charged criminally with distribution of harmful matter to minors. The store where the teen actually purchased the album was never named in the lawsuit.&lt;ref name=WishniaNation/&gt; The criminal charges focused on an illustration by [[H.R. Giger]], titled &quot;Work 219: Landscape XX&quot; (also known as ''[[Penis Landscape]]''). Included as a poster with the album, ''Penis Landscape'' depicts nine copulating penises.&lt;ref&gt;Deflem, Matthieu [http://www.cas.sc.edu/socy/faculty/deflem/zzcens97.htm &quot;RAP, ROCK AND CENSORSHIP: Popular Culture and the Technologies of Justice&quot;] March 2001 revision of a paper presented originally to the Law and Society Association, Chicago, May 30-27 30, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of the band and others in the chain of distribution were charged with violating the California Penal Code&lt;ref name=&quot;penalcode&quot;&gt;[http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/calaw.html California Penal Code] at leginfo.ca.gov&lt;/ref&gt; on a [[misdemeanor]] charge carrying a maximum penalty of up to a year in county jail and a base fine of up to $2,000. Biafra says that during this time government agents invaded and searched his home. The prosecution tried to present the poster to the jury in isolation for consideration as obscene material, but Judge Susan Isacoff ruled that the poster must be considered along with the music and lyrics.&lt;ref&gt;Staff, [http://www.metnews.com/articles/2004/reti052804.htm &quot;Judge Isacoff, Commissioner Duffey Slate July Retirements&quot;] Metropolitan News-Enterprise. Friday, May 28, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The charges against three of the original defendants, Ruth Schwartz (owner of [[Mordam Records]]), Steve Boudreau (a distributor involved in supplying ''Frankenchrist'' to the Los Angeles Wherehouse store), and Salvatore Alberti (owner of the factory where the record was pressed), were dismissed for lack of evidence.&lt;ref name=WishniaNation/&gt;

In August 1987, the criminal trial was submitted to the jury with the two remaining defendants: Jello Biafra and Michael Bonanno (former Alternative Tentacles label manager).&lt;ref name=WishniaNation/&gt; In August 1987, the criminal trial ended with a hung jury. The split on the jury was 7 to 5 in favor of acquittal for all of the [[defendant]]s. [[District Attorney]]s Michael Guarino and Ira Riener made a motion for a retrial which was denied by Judge Isacoff, [[Superior Court]] Judge for the County of Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;Drozdowski, Ted.

Jello Biafra brought up the court case after the break-up of the band on [[The Oprah Winfrey Show]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode | url=http://www.oprah.com/oprah_show.html | airdate=1990-03-07 | season=5 | title=Jello Biafra on The Oprah Winfrey Show | transcripturl=http://lemming.mahost.org/library/jello_oprah.txt}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biafra was on the show with [[Tipper Gore]] as part of a panel discussion on the issues of &quot;controversial music lyrics&quot; and censorship.

===''Bedtime for Democracy'' and break-up (1986)===
In addition to the obscenity lawsuit and being ignored by the mainstream media (MTV and most radio stations gave such groups scant notice, not to mention airplay), the band became increasingly disillusioned with the underground scene as well. The hardcore scene, which had been a haven for free-thinking intellectuals and downtrodden nonconformists, was increasingly attracting hooligans who came to punk concerts looking only to slam dance and fight to violent music.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} In earlier years the band had criticized neo-Nazi skinheads for trying to ruin the punk scene, but just as big a problem was the increasing popularity of thrash metal and stereotypical macho &quot;post-1982 hardcore&quot; which brought the group (and their genre) an audience that had little to do with the ideas/ideals they stood for. In January 1986, frustrated and alienated from their own scene, the DKs decided to break up to pursue other interests and played their last concert on February 21. The band continued to work on songs, with Biafra penning songs such as &quot;[[Chickenshit Conformist]]&quot; and &quot;[[Anarchy for Sale]]&quot;, which articulated their feelings about the &quot;dumbing down&quot; of punk rock.

During the summer they recorded these songs for their final album, ''[[Bedtime for Democracy]]'', which was released in November. The artwork, depicting a defaced [[Statue of Liberty]] overrun with Nazis, media, opportunists, Klan members, corrupt government officials, and religious zombies, echoed the idea that the punk scene was no longer a safe haven for &quot;your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free&quot;. The album contains a number of fast/short songs interspersed with jazz (&quot;D.M.S.O.&quot;), spoken word (&quot;A Commercial&quot;) and psychedelia (&quot;Cesspools In Eden&quot;). The lyrical focus is more introspective and earnest (&quot;Where Do Ya Draw The Line?&quot;&quot;), with an anti-war, anti-violence (&quot;Rambozo The Clown&quot;) bent, moving away from the violent imagery of their early records, while remaining as subversive as ever (&quot;I Spy&quot;, &quot;D.M.S.O.&quot;). In December, the band announced their split. Biafra went on to speak about his political beliefs on numerous television shows and he released a number of [[spoken-word]] albums. Ray, Flouride, and Peligro also went on to solo careers.

===Legal conflicts===
====Lawsuits over royalty payments====
{{No footnotes|date=September 2008}}
In the late 1990s, former band members discovered problems with the amount of payments which each band member had received from their record label [[Alternative Tentacles]]. Former band members claimed that Jello Biafra had conspired to pay less royalty rates to the band members. Although both sides agreed that the failure to pay these royalties was an accounting mistake, they were upset that Biafra failed to inform the band of the mistake after he and his co-workers discovered it.

Biafra claims that their lawyers had told him only to correspond through lawyers and not directly with the band, as the conflict over payment had apparently arisen before the accounting mistake was discovered. Both sides claim they attempted to resolve the matter without legal action, but the ultimately complicated legal dispute (involving royalties, publishing rights, and a number of other issues) soon led to the courts, where Biafra was found liable for the royalties and guilty of [[fraud]] and [[malice (legal term)|malice]], and was ordered to pay damages of nearly $200,000, including $20,000 in punitive damages, to the band members.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Malice was defined for the jury as &quot;conduct which is intended to cause injury or despicable conduct which is carried with a willful and conscious disregard for the rights of others&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;bs1&quot;&gt;[http://mi2n.com/press.php3?press_nb=17130 ''Music Industry News Network'']&lt;/ref&gt; Biafra's appeal was denied; he had to pay the outstanding royalties and punitive damages,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phillaw.com/casepdfs/Dead%20Kennedys%20Superior%20Court.pdf Dead Kennedys v. Jello Biafra Verdict], Cal.App.1 Dist.,2003 A094272&lt;/ref&gt; and was forced to hand over the rights to the majority of Dead Kennedys' back catalogue to the Decay Music partnership.

The jury and judges also noted, in their words, that Biafra “lacked credibility” on the songwriting issue and found from evidence presented by both sides that the songwriting credits were due to the entire band, using a clause in the band's written partnership giving a small share of every Dead Kennedys song royalty directly to the band partnership.&lt;ref&gt;FN4, [http://www.phillaw.com/casepdfs/Dead%20Kennedys%20Superior%20Court.pdf Dead Kennedys v. Jello Biafra Verdict], Cal.App.1 Dist.,2003 A094272&lt;/ref&gt;

Biafra had received sole songwriting credit for most Dead Kennedys songs on all released albums for the last 20 years or so without complaints from the band, though a minority of songs had given credit to certain group members or the entire band as a whole, indicating a system designed to reflect the primary composers rather than a regimented system like the [[Jagger/Richards]] partnership; today, most Kennedys reissues list the songwriters as &quot;Biafra, Dead Kennedys&quot;, indicating Biafra's lyrical contributions—which the band doesn't dispute, or else simply as &quot;Dead Kennedys&quot;). Ray, Flouride and Peligro found new distribution through another label, [[Manifesto Records]].

This dispute was hotly contested by all concerned who felt passionately for their cause, and the case caused minor waves within punk circles. Biafra claims that guitarist [[East Bay Ray]] had long expressed displeasure with Alternative Tentacles and with the amount of money he received from them, thus the original incentive for the discovery of the back payments. It was found out that Alternative Tentacles was paying Dead Kennedys less per CD than all the other bands, including Biafra himself, and not informing his other bandmates, which was the fraud. Biafra accused the band of wanting to license the famous Dead Kennedys song &quot;[[Holiday in Cambodia]]&quot; for use in a [[Levi's]] jeans commercial, which the band denied.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Biafra apparently pushed this issue in court, although there was no hard evidence and the jurors were apparently unconcerned with corporate use of independently produced political music. Biafra would later complain that the jury was not sympathetic toward underground music and punk culture. The song never appeared in a Levi's commercial, although in interviews Biafra described the situation surrounding the commercial in detail and was able to give specifics about the advertisement, including the name of the advertising agency that had created the commercial's script.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Biafra's former bandmates maintain that they sued because of Jello Biafra's deliberate withholding of money, though when pressed they have acknowledged that the payment was an accounting mistake, but insist that Biafra was wrong in failing to inform the band directly. Details about this issue remain scarce. The band also maintains that the Levi's story was completely fictitious and invented by Biafra to discredit them. Ultimately, these issues have led to a souring of relationships with the erstwhile bandmates, who still have not resolved their personal differences as of 2008.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

====Disputes over new commercial activities====
Matters were stirred up even further when the three bandmates invited Jello Biafra to &quot;bury the hatchet&quot; in the form of a band reunion. Jello Biafra felt it was unprofessional because no one contacted him directly. In addition, Biafra was disdainful of the reunion, and having long expressed his disdain for nostalgia and rock reunion/oldies tours in particular, argued that the whole affair was motivated by greed. {{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

Several DVDs, re-issues, and live albums have been released since the departure of Biafra most recently on Manifesto Records. According to Biafra, the live albums are &quot;cash-ins&quot; on Dead Kennedys' name and his music. Biafra also accused the releases of the new live material of having poor sound quality. Furthermore he has stated he is not receiving any royalties from the sale of any Manifesto Records releases. Consequently, he has discouraged fans from buying any Dead Kennedy reissues. The other band members denied Biafra's accusations regarding the live releases, and have defended the mixes as an effort of hard work. Biafra dismissed the new group as &quot;the world's greediest karaoke band.&quot; Nevertheless, in 2003, [[Klaus Flouride]], bassist for the band, had this to say of performances without the band's former frontman: &quot;There hasn't been a show yet that people didn't really like.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.citizinemag.com/music/music-0309_klausflouride.htm &quot;Interview with Dead Kennedys' Klaus Flouride&quot;] by Mark Prindle, ''Citizine'', September 1, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Biafra further criticized them for advertising shows using his own image taken from the original '80s incarnation of the band, which he labeled as false advertising. He recently attacked the reformed Dead Kennedys in a song called &quot;[[Those Dumb Punk Kids (Will Buy Anything)]]&quot;, which appears on his second collaboration with sludge metal band [[The Melvins]], ''[[Sieg Howdy!]]''.

Biafra told an audience at a speaking gig in [[Trenton, New Jersey|Trenton]], [[New Jersey]], that the remaining Dead Kennedys have licensed their single &quot;Too Drunk to Fuck&quot; to be used in a rape scene in a [[Robert Rodriguez]] movie. The reference is to a lounge cover of the song, recorded by the band [[Nouvelle Vague (band)|Nouvelle Vague]], played during a scene in the ''[[Planet Terror]]'' segment of ''[[Grindhouse (film)|Grindhouse]]'', although no rape takes place, and in fact the would-be rapist is killed by the would-be victim. The scene in ''Planet Terror'' has would-be rapist, &quot;Rapist #1&quot; ([[Quentin Tarantino]]) order one-legged stripper &quot;Cherry Darlin&quot; ([[Rose McGowan]]) to get up off the floor and dance. At this point Tarantino hits play on a cassette recorder and Nouvelle Vague's cover of &quot;Too Drunk To Fuck&quot; plays.

Jello, clearly disapproving of the situation, later wrote, &quot;This is their lowest point since Levi's… This goes against everything the Dead Kennedys stands for in spades… The terrified woman later 'wins' by killing Tarantino, but that excuse does not rescue this at all. I wrote every note of that song and this is not what it was meant for…. Some people will do anything for money. I can't help but think back to how prudish Klaus Flouride was when he objected to H.R. Giger's painting on the &quot;[[Frankenchrist]]&quot; (sic) poster, saying he couldn't bear to show it to his parents. I'd sure love to be a fly on the wall when he tries to explain putting a song in a rape scene for money to his teenage daughter… The deal was pushed through by a new business manager the other three hired.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alternativetentacles.com/news.php?page=3&amp;news_section=JELLO&amp;window_size=15&amp;sd=iIdfyzSpZwkE0A3pVRu &quot;Greedy ex-DKs okay song for rape scene in new Tarantino Movie&quot;] Alternative Tentacles news page, March 15, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reforming of new band line-up===
The reformed Dead Kennedys followed their court victory by announcing a number of tour dates, releasing reissues of all Dead Kennedys albums (except ''[[Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables]]'', to which they did not have the rights until 2005), releasing several new archival concert DVDs, and licensing several songs to ''[[The Manchurian Candidate (2004 film)|The Manchurian Candidate]]'' remake and the [[Tony Hawk Pro Skater]] video game. [[East Bay Ray]] claims he received a fax from Alternative Tentacles purporting Biafra approved the licensing for the game,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deadkennedysnews.com/images/tonyhawk.jpg Fax from Uli Elser], previous manager of Alternative Tentacles, May 5, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; which Biafra denies happening.

The band claims on their website that they still pay close attention to an [[anti-corporate]] ideology, despite performing on September 5, 2003 at a festival in [[Turkey]] that was sponsored by [[Coca-Cola]], noting that they have since pulled out of a show in Los Angeles when they found that it was being sponsored by [[Coors Brewing Company|Coors]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.deadkennedys.com/news.htm#100605 DKs Pull Out of “Waking the Dead” Show]&quot; ''DeadKennedys.com''. October 6, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Biafra claims the above mentioned licensing deals prove otherwise. Some have found difficulty reconciling this claim when Biafra also licensed to major corporations, approving with the other band members use of Dead Kennedys’ songs in major studio film releases such as ''[[Neighbors (film)|Neighbors]]'', ''[[Freddy Got Fingered]]'', and ''[[Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (film)|Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb name|1389065}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, Ray, Peligro, and Flouride chose former [[Dr. Know (band)|Dr. Know]] singer [[Brandon Cruz]] to replace Biafra on vocals. The band played under name &quot;DK Kennedys&quot; for a few concerts, but later reverted to &quot;Dead Kennedys&quot; permanently. They played across the continental United States, Europe, Asia, South America, and Russia. Brandon Cruz left the band in May 2003 and was replaced by [[Jeff Penalty]]. The band has released two live albums of archival performances on Manifesto Records: ''[[Mutiny on the Bay]]'', compiled from various live shows including a recording from their last show with Biafra in 1986, and ''[[Live at the Deaf Club]]'', a recording of a 1979 performance at the Deaf Club in [[San Francisco]] which was greeted with more enthusiasm.

On October 9, 2007, a best-of album entitled ''[[Milking the Sacred Cow]]'' was released. It includes two previously unreleased live versions of &quot;Soup Is Good Food&quot; and &quot;Jock-O-Rama&quot;, originally found on ''Frankenchrist''.

Jeff Penalty left the band in March, 2008 in what he describes as a &quot;not amicable split.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Punknews.org [http://www.punknews.org/article/28168] retrieved March 21, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; He was replaced by former [[Wynona Riders]] singer Ron &quot;Skip&quot; Greer.  D.H. also left the band to &quot;take some personal time off&quot;. He was replaced for a tour by [[Translator (band)|Translator]] drummer [[Dave Scheff]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deadkennedys.com/news.html#032408 Welcome To The Official Website For Dead Kennedys&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Break from touring===
On August 21, 2008, the band announced an extended break from touring due to the health-related issues of Flouride and Peligro. They stated their plans to collaborate on new projects. The band performed a gig in [[Santa Rosa, California]] in June 2009, with Peligro returning to the drum kit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deadkennedys.com/tours.html Official Dead Kennedys web site]&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2010 the Dead Kennedys announced plans for a short East Coast tour.  This lineup assembled for this tour contained East Bay Ray, Peligro, Greer, and bassist Greg Reeves replacing Flouride, who was taking &quot;personal time off&quot; from the band.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deadkennedys.com/news.html#081110 Official web page news section]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://serviette.ca/radio_show/2011/nw20110211.mp3 Nardwuar interview with Jello Biafra],February 11, 2011, accessed April 5, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The tour dates will include performances in [[Philadelphia]], [[New York City]], [[Boston]], [[Washington, D.C.]], [[Portland, Maine]] and [[Hawaii]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.punknews.org/article/39114 Dead Kennedy's 2010 tour]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Possible new material===
The Dead Kennedys performed what appears to be their first new song in 24 years, &quot;You're Such a Fake&quot;, during their October 16, 2010, concert at the Rock and Roll Hotel in [[Washington, D.C.]]. In addition, the band played a reworked version of the old song &quot;MTV Get Off the Air&quot;, now re-titled &quot;MP3 Get Off the Web&quot;, with lyrics that were &quot;changed to be about people downloading MP3s and how much they suck for doing it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;newmaterial&quot;/&gt;

==&quot;DK&quot; logo==
[[Image:DK logo.jpg|thumb|right|70px|&quot;DK&quot; logo]]The original logo was created by [[Winston Smith (artist)|Winston Smith]]. He later contributed artwork for the covers of ''[[In God We Trust, Inc.]]'', ''[[Plastic Surgery Disasters]]'', ''[[Frankenchrist]]'', ''[[Bedtime for Democracy]]'', ''[[Give Me Convenience or Give Me Death]]'', the back cover of the &quot;[[Kill the Poor]]&quot; single and the [[Alternative Tentacles]] logo. When asked about the &quot;DK&quot; logo in an interview, Jello Biafra explained, &quot;...I wanted to make sure it was something simple and easy to spray-paint so people would graffiti it all over the place, and then I showed it to Winston Smith. He played around with it, came back with a bunch of designs that had the circle and slightly 3-D looking letters and he had ones with different patterns behind it. I liked the one with bricks, but ultimately I thought simple red behind it was the boldest and the best.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://trembleunderboomlights.blogspot.com/2007/05/interview-with-jello-biafra.html Tremble Under Boom Lights: Interview with Jello Biafra&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lyrics==
Dead Kennedys are noted for the harshness of their lyrics, which generally combined biting social satire while expressing a staunchly left-wing view of contemporary America.&lt;ref&gt;music.msn.com/music/artist/dead-kennedys.1/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;search.barnesandnoble.com/Dead-Kennedys/.../9780867193121&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike other leftist punk bands who use more direct sloganeering, Dead Kennedys' lyrics are often snide. &quot;[[Holiday in Cambodia]]&quot; is a multi-layered satire targeting both the liberal elite and [[Cambodia]]'s then-current [[Khmer Rouge]] regime.

[[File:ADN animation.gif|thumb|The structure of part of a DNA [[double helix]]]]

'''Deoxyribonucleic acid''' ({{IPA-en|diˌɒksiˌraɪbɵ.njuːˌkleɪ.ɨk ˈæsɪd||en-us-Deoxyribonucleic_acid.ogg}}), or '''DNA''', is a [[nucleic acid]] that contains the [[genetics|genetic]] instructions used in the development and functioning of all known living [[organism]]s (with the exception of [[RNA virus]]es). The main role of DNA [[molecule]]s is the long-term storage of [[information]]. DNA is often compared to a set of [[blueprint]]s, like a recipe or a code, since it contains the instructions needed to construct other components of [[cell (biology)|cells]], such as [[protein]]s and [[RNA]] molecules. The DNA segments that carry this genetic information are called [[gene]]s, but other DNA sequences have structural purposes, or are involved in regulating the use of this genetic information.

DNA consists of two long [[polymers]] of simple units called [[nucleotide]]s, with [[backbone chain|backbone]]s made of [[Monosaccharide|sugar]]s and [[phosphate]] groups joined by [[ester]] bonds. These two strands run in opposite directions to each other and are therefore [[antiparallel (biochemistry)|anti-parallel]]. Attached to each sugar is one of four types of molecules called [[nucleobase|bases]]. It is the sequence of these four bases along the backbone that encodes information. This information is read using the [[genetic code]], which specifies the sequence of the [[amino acid]]s within proteins. The code is read by copying stretches of DNA into the related nucleic acid RNA, in a process called [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]].

Within cells, DNA is organized into long structures called [[chromosome]]s. These chromosomes are duplicated before cells [[cell division|divide]], in a process called [[DNA replication]]. [[Eukaryote|Eukaryotic organisms]] ([[animal]]s, [[plant]]s, [[Fungus|fungi]], and [[protist]]s) store most of their DNA inside the [[cell nucleus]] and some of their DNA in [[organelle]]s, such as [[mitochondria]] or [[chloroplasts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Russell | first = Peter | title = iGenetics | publisher = Benjamin Cummings | location = New York | year = 2001 | isbn = 0-8053-4553-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, [[prokaryote]]s ([[bacteria]] and [[archaea]]) store their DNA only in the [[cytoplasm]]. Within the chromosomes, [[chromatin]] proteins such as [[histone]]s compact and organize DNA. These compact structures guide the interactions between DNA and other proteins, helping control which parts of the DNA are transcribed.

Watson]] and [[Francis Crick]], the structure of DNA of all species comprises two helical chains each coiled round the same axis, and each with a pitch of 34&amp;nbsp;[[Ångström]]s (3.4&amp;nbsp;[[nanometre]]s) and a radius of 10&amp;nbsp;[[Ångström]]s (1.0&amp;nbsp;[[nanometre]]s).&lt;ref name=FWPUB&gt;{{cite journal| author = Watson J.D. and Crick F.H.C. | pmid=13054692 | doi = 10.1038/171737a0 | url= http://www.nature.com/nature/dna50/watsoncrick.pdf | title=A Structure for Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid | journal=Nature | volume=171 | pages=737–738 | year=1953 | format=PDF| issue = 4356}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to another study, when measured in a particular solution, the DNA chain measured 22 to 26&amp;nbsp;[[Ångström]]s wide (2.2 to 2.6&amp;nbsp;[[nanometre]]s), and one nucleotide unit measured 3.3&amp;nbsp;Å (0.33&amp;nbsp;nm) long.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mandelkern M, Elias J, Eden D, Crothers D |title=The dimensions of DNA in solution |journal=J Mol Biol |volume=152 |issue=1 |pages=153–61 |year=1981 |pmid=7338906 |doi=10.1016/0022-2836(81)90099-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although each individual repeating unit is very small, DNA polymers can be very large molecules containing millions of nucleotides. For instance, the largest [[human chromosome]], chromosome number 1, is approximately 220 million [[base pair]]s long.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gregory S |title=The DNA sequence and biological annotation of human chromosome 1 |journal=Nature |volume=441 |issue=7091 |pages=315–21 |year=2006 |pmid=16710414 | doi = 10.1038/nature04727 |last2=Barlow |first2=KF |last3=McLay |first3=KE |last4=Kaul |first4=R |last5=Swarbreck |first5=D |last6=Dunham |first6=A |last7=Scott |first7=CE |last8=Howe |first8=KL |last9=Woodfine |first9=K}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In living organisms, DNA does not usually exist as a single molecule, but instead as a pair of molecules that are held tightly together.&lt;ref name=FWPUB&gt;{{cite journal| author = Watson J.D. and Crick F.H.C. | pmid=13054692 | doi = 10.1038/171737a0 | url= http://www.nature.com/nature/dna50/watsoncrick.pdf | title=A Structure for Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid | journal=Nature | volume=171 | pages=737–738 | year=1953 | accessdate=4 May 2009|format=PDF| issue = 4356}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=berg&gt;Berg J., Tymoczko J. and Stryer L. (2002) ''Biochemistry.'' W. H. Freeman and Company ISBN 0-7167-4955-6&lt;/ref&gt; These two long strands entwine like vines, in the shape of a [[double helix]]. The nucleotide repeats contain both the segment of the backbone of the molecule, which holds the chain together, and a base, which interacts with the other DNA strand in the helix. A base linked to a sugar is called a [[nucleoside]] and a base linked to a sugar and one or more phosphate groups is called a [[nucleotide]]. If multiple nucleotides are linked together, as in DNA, this polymer is called a [[polynucleotide]].&lt;ref name=IUPAC&gt;[http://www.chem.qmul.ac.uk/iupac/misc/naabb.html Abbreviations and Symbols for Nucleic Acids, Polynucleotides and their Constituents] IUPAC-IUB Commission on Biochemical Nomenclature (CBN). Retrieved 03 January 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The backbone of the DNA strand is made from alternating [[phosphate]] and [[carbohydrate|sugar]] residues.&lt;ref name=Ghosh&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ghosh A, Bansal M |title=A glossary of DNA structures from A to Z |journal=Acta Crystallogr D Biol Crystallogr |volume=59 |issue=Pt 4 |pages=620–6 |year=2003 |pmid=12657780 |doi=10.1107/S0907444903003251}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sugar in DNA is [[deoxyribose|2-deoxyribose]], which is a [[pentose]] (five-[[carbon]]) sugar. The sugars are joined together by phosphate groups that form [[phosphodiester bond]]s between the third and fifth carbon [[atom]]s of adjacent sugar rings. These asymmetric [[covalent bond|bonds]] mean a strand of DNA has a direction. In a double helix the direction of the nucleotides in one strand is opposite to their direction in the other strand: the strands are ''antiparallel''. The asymmetric ends of DNA strands are called the [[directionality (molecular biology)|5′]] (''five prime'') and [[directionality (molecular biology)|3′]] (''three prime'') ends, with the 5' end having a terminal phosphate group and the 3' end a terminal hydroxyl group. One major difference between DNA and RNA is the sugar, with the 2-deoxyribose in DNA being replaced by the alternative pentose sugar [[ribose]] in RNA.&lt;ref name=berg/&gt;

The DNA double helix is stabilized primarily by two forces: [[hydrogen bond]]s between nucleotides and [[Stacking (chemistry)|base-stacking]] interactions among the [[aromatic]] bases.&lt;ref name=&quot;Yakovchuk2006&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Yakovchuk P, Protozanova E, Frank-Kamenetskii MD |title=Base-stacking and base-pairing contributions into thermal stability of the DNA double helix |journal=Nucleic Acids Res. |volume=34 |issue=2 |pages=564–74 |year=2006 |pmid=16449200 |pmc=1360284 |doi=10.1093/nar/gkj454 |url=http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=16449200}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the aqueous environment of the cell, the conjugated [[Pi bond|π bonds]] of nucleotide bases align perpendicular to the axis of the DNA molecule, minimizing their interaction with the [[solvation shell]] and therefore, the [[Gibbs free energy]].  The four bases found in DNA are [[adenine]] (abbreviated A), [[cytosine]] (C), [[guanine]] (G) and [[thymine]] (T). These four bases are attached to the sugar/phosphate to form the complete nucleotide, as shown for [[adenosine monophosphate]].

These bases are classified into two types; adenine and guanine are fused five- and six-membered [[heterocyclic compound]]s called [[purine]]s, while cytosine and thymine are six-membered rings called [[pyrimidine]]s.&lt;ref name=berg/&gt; A fifth pyrimidine base, called [[uracil]] (U), usually takes the place of thymine in RNA and differs from thymine by lacking a [[methyl group]] on its ring. Uracil is not usually found in DNA, occurring only as a breakdown product of cytosine. In addition to RNA and DNA, a large number of artificial [[nucleic acid analogues]] have also been created to study the proprieties of nucleic acids, or for use in biotechnology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Verma S, Eckstein F |title=Modified oligonucleotides: synthesis and strategy for users |journal=Annu. Rev. Biochem. |volume=67 |issue= |pages=99–134 |year=1998 |pmid=9759484 |doi=10.1146/annurev.biochem.67.1.99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:DNA-ligand-by-Abalone.png|left|thumb|Major and minor grooves of DNA. Minor groove is a binding site for the dye [[Hoechst stain|Hoechst 33258]].]]

===Grooves===

Twin helical strands form the DNA backbone. Another double helix may be found by tracing the spaces, or grooves, between the strands. These voids are adjacent to the base pairs and may provide a [[binding site]]. As the strands are not directly opposite each other, the grooves are unequally sized. One groove, the major groove, is 22&amp;nbsp;Å wide and the other, the minor groove, is 12&amp;nbsp;Å wide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wing R, Drew H, Takano T, Broka C, Tanaka S, Itakura K, Dickerson R |title=Crystal structure analysis of a complete turn of B-DNA |journal=Nature |volume=287 |issue=5784 |pages=755–8 |year=1980 |pmid=7432492 |doi=10.1038/287755a0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The narrowness of the minor groove means that the edges of the bases are more accessible in the major groove. As a result, proteins like [[transcription factor]]s that can bind to specific sequences in double-stranded DNA usually make contacts to the sides of the bases exposed in the major groove.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pabo C, Sauer R |title=Protein-DNA recognition |journal=Annu Rev Biochem |volume=53 |pages=293–321 |year=1984 |pmid=6236744 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.bi.53.070184.001453}}&lt;/ref&gt; This situation varies in unusual conformations of DNA within the cell ''(see below)'', but the major and minor grooves are always named to reflect the differences in size that would be seen if the DNA is twisted back into the ordinary B form.

===Base pairing===
{{Further|[[Base pair]]}}

Each type of base on one strand forms a bond with just one type of base on the other strand. This is called complementary [[base pair]]ing. Here, purines form [[hydrogen bond]]s to pyrimidines, with A bonding only to T, and C bonding only to G. This arrangement of two nucleotides binding together across the double helix is called a base pair. As hydrogen bonds are not [[covalent bond|covalent]], they can be broken and rejoined relatively easily. The two strands of DNA in a double helix can therefore be pulled apart like a zipper, either by a mechanical force or high [[temperature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Clausen-Schaumann H, Rief M, Tolksdorf C, Gaub H |title=Mechanical stability of single DNA molecules |pmc=1300792 |journal=Biophys J |volume=78 |issue=4 |pages=1997–2007 |year=2000 |pmid=10733978 |doi=10.1016/S0006-3495(00)76747-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this complementarity, all the information in the double-stranded sequence of a DNA helix is duplicated on each strand, which is vital in DNA replication. Indeed, this reversible and specific interaction between complementary base pairs is critical for all the functions of DNA in living organisms.&lt;ref name=Alberts/&gt;

Bottom, an '''AT''' base pair with two hydrogen bonds. Non-covalent hydrogen bonds between the pairs are shown as dashed lines.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
The two types of base pairs form different numbers of hydrogen bonds, AT forming two hydrogen bonds, and GC forming three hydrogen bonds (see figures, left).
DNA with high [[GC-content]] is more stable than DNA with low GC-content, due to the added stability of an additional hydrogen bond.

As a result, it is both the percentage of GC base pairs and the overall length of a DNA double helix that determine the strength of the association between the two strands of DNA. Long DNA helices with a high GC content have stronger-interacting strands, while short helices with high AT content have weaker-interacting strands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Chalikian T, Völker J, Plum G, Breslauer K |title=A more unified picture for the thermodynamics of nucleic acid duplex melting: a characterization by calorimetric and volumetric techniques |pmc=22151 |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA |volume=96 |issue=14 |pages=7853–8 |year=1999 |pmid=10393911 |doi=10.1073/pnas.96.14.7853}}&lt;/ref&gt; In biology, parts of the DNA double helix that need to separate easily, such as the TATAAT [[Pribnow box]] in some [[promoter (biology)|promoter]]s, tend to have a high AT content, making the strands easier to pull apart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=deHaseth P, Helmann J |title=Open complex formation by Escherichia coli RNA polymerase: the mechanism of polymerase-induced strand separation of double helical DNA |journal=Mol Microbiol |volume=16 |issue=5 |pages=817–24 |year=1995 |pmid=7476180 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2958.1995.tb02309.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the laboratory, the strength of this interaction can be measured by finding the temperature required to break the hydrogen bonds, their [[DNA melting|melting temperature]] (also called ''T&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' value). When all the base pairs in a DNA double helix melt, the strands separate and exist in solution as two entirely independent molecules. These {{Anchor|ssDNA}}single-stranded DNA molecules (''ssDNA'') have no single common shape, but some conformations are more stable than others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Isaksson J, Acharya S, Barman J, Cheruku P, Chattopadhyaya J |title=Single-stranded adenine-rich DNA and RNA retain structural characteristics of their respective double-stranded conformations and show directional differences in stacking pattern |journal=Biochemistry |volume=43 |issue=51 |pages=15996–6010 |year=2004 |pmid=15609994 | doi = 10.1021/bi048221v}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sense and antisense===
{{Further|[[Sense (molecular biology)]]}}

A DNA sequence is called &quot;sense&quot; if its sequence is the same as that of a [[messenger RNA]] copy that is translated into protein.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chem.qmul.ac.uk/iubmb/newsletter/misc/DNA.html Designation of the two strands of DNA] JCBN/NC-IUB Newsletter 1989, Accessed 07 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The sequence on the opposite strand is called the &quot;antisense&quot; sequence. Both sense and antisense sequences can exist on different parts of the same strand of DNA (i.e. both strands contain both sense and antisense sequences). In both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, antisense RNA sequences are produced, but the functions of these RNAs are not entirely clear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hüttenhofer A, Schattner P, Polacek N |title=Non-coding RNAs: hope or hype? |journal=Trends Genet |volume=21 |issue=5 |pages=289–97 |year=2005 |pmid=15851066 |doi=10.1016/j.tig.2005.03.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; One proposal is that antisense RNAs are involved in regulating [[gene expression]] through RNA-RNA base pairing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Munroe S |title=Diversity of antisense regulation in eukaryotes: multiple mechanisms, emerging patterns |journal=J Cell Biochem |volume=93 |issue=4 |pages=664–71 |year=2004 |pmid=15389973 | doi = 10.1002/jcb.20252}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few DNA sequences in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, and more in [[plasmid]]s and [[virus]]es, blur the distinction between sense and antisense strands by having overlapping genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Makalowska I, Lin C, Makalowski W |title=Overlapping genes in vertebrate genomes |journal=Comput Biol Chem |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=1–12 |year=2005 |pmid=15680581 |doi=10.1016/j.compbiolchem.2004.12.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these cases, some DNA sequences do double duty, encoding one protein when read along one strand, and a second protein when read in the opposite direction along the other strand. In [[bacteria]], this overlap may be involved in the regulation of gene transcription,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Johnson Z, Chisholm S |title=Properties of overlapping genes are conserved across microbial genomes |journal=Genome Res |volume=14 |issue=11 |pages=2268–72 |year=2004 |pmid=15520290 | doi = 10.1101/gr.2433104 |pmc=525685}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in viruses, overlapping genes increase the amount of information that can be encoded within the small viral genome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lamb R, Horvath C |title=Diversity of coding strategies in influenza viruses |journal=Trends Genet |volume=7 |issue=8 |pages=261–6 |year=1991 |pmid=1771674}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Supercoiling===
{{Further|[[DNA supercoil]]}}
DNA can be twisted like a rope in a process called [[DNA supercoil]]ing. With DNA in its &quot;relaxed&quot; state, a strand usually circles the axis of the double helix once every 10.4 base pairs, but if the DNA is twisted the strands become more tightly or more loosely wound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Benham C, Mielke S |title=DNA mechanics |journal= Annu Rev Biomed Eng |volume=7 |pages=21–53 |year=2005 |pmid=16004565 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.bioeng.6.062403.132016}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the DNA is twisted in the direction of the helix, this is positive supercoiling, and the bases are held more tightly together.

===Alternate DNA chemistry===
For a number of years exobiologists have proposed the existence of a [[shadow biosphere]], a postulated microbial biosphere of Earth that uses radically different biochemical and molecular processes than currently known life. One of the proposals was the existence of lifeforms that use [[Arsenic DNA|arsenic instead of phosphorus in DNA]].

A December 2010 [[NASA]] press conference revealed that the [[bacterium]] [[GFAJ-1]], which has evolved in an arsenic-rich environment, is the first terrestrial lifeform found which may have this ability. The bacterium was found in [[Mono Lake]], east of [[Yosemite National Park]]. GFAJ-1 is a [[rod]]-shaped [[extremophile]] bacterium in the family [[Halomonadaceae]] that, when starved of [[phosphorus]], may be capable of incorporating the usually poisonous element [[arsenic]] in its DNA.&lt;ref name='arsenic extremophile'&gt;{{cite news | first = Jason Palmer | title = Arsenic-loving bacteria may help in hunt for alien life | date = December 2, 2010 | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-11886943 | work = BBC News | accessdate = 2010-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; This discovery may lend weight to the long-standing idea that [[life on other planets|extraterrestrial life]] could have a [[Hypothetical types of biochemistry|different chemical makeup]] from life on [[Earth]].&lt;ref name='arsenic extremophile'/&gt;&lt;ref name=Space&gt;{{cite news | last = Bortman | first = Henry | title = Arsenic-Eating Bacteria Opens New Possibilities for Alien Life | date = 2010-12-02 | publisher = Space.com | url = http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/arsenic-bacteria-alien-life-101202.html | work = [http://www.space.com/ Space.Com web site] | accessdate = 2010-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The research was carried out by a team led by [[Felisa Wolfe-Simon]], a [[geomicrobiologist]] and [[geobiochemistry|geobiochemist]], a Postdoctoral Fellow of the [[NASA Astrobiology Institute]] with [[Arizona State University]].

===Quadruplex structures===

At the ends of the linear chromosomes are specialized regions of DNA called [[telomere]]s. The main function of these regions is to allow the cell to replicate chromosome ends using the enzyme [[telomerase]], as the enzymes that normally replicate DNA cannot copy the extreme 3′ ends of chromosomes.&lt;ref name=Greider&gt;{{cite journal |author=Greider C, Blackburn E |title=Identification of a specific telomere terminal transferase activity in Tetrahymena extracts | journal=Cell |volume=43 |issue=2 Pt 1 | pages=405–13 |year=1985 |pmid=3907856 |doi=10.1016/0092-8674(85)90170-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; These specialized chromosome caps also help protect the DNA ends, and stop the [[DNA repair]] systems in the cell from treating them as damage to be corrected.&lt;ref name=Nugent&gt;{{cite journal |author=Nugent C, Lundblad V |title=The telomerase reverse transcriptase: components and regulation | url=http://www.genesdev.org/cgi/content/full/12/8/1073 | journal=Genes Dev |volume=12 |issue=8 | pages=1073–85 |year=1998 |pmid=9553037 |doi=10.1101/gad.12.8.1073}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[List of distinct cell types in the adult human body|human cells]], telomeres are usually lengths of single-stranded DNA containing several thousand repeats of a simple TTAGGG sequence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wright W, Tesmer V, Huffman K, Levene S, Shay J |title=Normal human chromosomes have long G-rich telomeric overhangs at one end | url=http://www.genesdev.org/cgi/content/full/11/21/2801 | journal=Genes Dev |volume=11 |issue=21 | pages=2801–9 |year=1997 |pmid=9353250 |doi=10.1101/gad.11.21.2801 |pmc=316649}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These guanine-rich sequences may stabilize chromosome ends by forming structures of stacked sets of four-base units, rather than the usual base pairs found in other DNA molecules. Here, four guanine bases form a flat plate and these flat four-base units then stack on top of each other, to form a stable ''[[G-quadruplex]]'' structure.&lt;ref name=Burge&gt;{{cite journal |author=Burge S, Parkinson G, Hazel P, Todd A, Neidle S |title=Quadruplex DNA: sequence, topology and structure | journal=Nucleic Acids Res |volume=34 |issue=19 | pages=5402–15 |year=2006 |pmid=17012276 |pmc=1636468 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkl655 |url=http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=17012276}}&lt;/ref&gt; These structures are stabilized by hydrogen bonding between the edges of the bases and [[chelation]] of a metal ion in the centre of each four-base unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Parkinson G, Lee M, Neidle S |title=Crystal structure of parallel quadruplexes from human telomeric DNA | journal=Nature |volume=417 |issue=6891 | pages=876–80 |year=2002 |pmid=12050675 | doi = 10.1038/nature755}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other structures can also be formed, with the central set of four bases coming from either a single strand folded around the bases, or several different parallel strands, each contributing one base to the central structure.

In addition to these stacked structures, telomeres also form large loop structures called telomere loops, or T-loops. Here, the single-stranded DNA curls around in a long circle stabilized by telomere-binding proteins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Griffith J, Comeau L, Rosenfield S, Stansel R, Bianchi A, Moss H, de Lange T |title=Mammalian telomeres end in a large duplex loop | journal=Cell |volume=97 |issue=4 | pages=503–14 |year=1999 |pmid=10338214 |doi=10.1016/S0092-8674(00)80760-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the very end of the T-loop, the single-stranded telomere DNA is held onto a region of double-stranded DNA by the telomere strand disrupting the double-helical DNA and base pairing to one of the two strands. This [[Triple-stranded DNA|triple-stranded]] structure is called a displacement loop or [[D-loop]].&lt;ref name=Burge/&gt;

In DNA [[DNA end#Frayed ends|fraying]] occurs when non-complementary regions exist at the end of an otherwise complementary double-strand of DNA. However, branched DNA can occur if a third strand of DNA is introduced and contains adjoining regions able to hybridize with the frayed regions of the pre-existing double-strand. Although the simplest example of branched DNA involves only three strands of DNA, complexes involving additional strands and multiple branches are also possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Seeman NC |title=DNA enables nanoscale control of the structure of matter |journal=Q.

===Base modifications===
{{Further|[[DNA methylation]]}}
The expression of genes is influenced by how the DNA is packaged in chromosomes, in a structure called [[chromatin]]. Base modifications can be involved in packaging, with regions that have low or no gene expression usually containing high levels of [[methylation]] of [[cytosine]] bases. For example, cytosine methylation, produces [[5-Methylcytosine|5-methylcytosine]], which is important for [[X-inactivation|X-chromosome inactivation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Klose R, Bird A |title=Genomic DNA methylation: the mark and its mediators | journal=Trends Biochem Sci |volume=31 |issue=2 | pages=89–97 |year=2006 |pmid=16403636 |doi=10.1016/j.tibs.2005.12.008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The average level of methylation varies between organisms – the worm ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]'' lacks cytosine methylation, while [[vertebrate]]s have higher levels, with up to 1% of their DNA containing 5-methylcytosine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bird A |title=DNA methylation patterns and epigenetic memory | journal=Genes Dev |volume=16 |issue=1 | pages=6–21 |year=2002 |pmid=11782440 |doi=10.1101/gad.947102}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the importance of 5-methylcytosine, it can [[deamination|deaminate]] to leave a thymine base, so methylated cytosines are particularly prone to [[mutation]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Walsh C, Xu G |title=Cytosine methylation and DNA repair | journal=Curr Top Microbiol Immunol |volume=301 | pages=283–315 |year=2006|pmid=16570853 |doi=10.1007/3-540-31390-7_11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other base modifications include adenine methylation in bacteria, the presence of [[5-hydroxymethylcytosine]] in the [[brain]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kriaucionis S, Heintz N |title=The nuclear DNA base 5-hydroxymethylcytosine is present in Purkinje neurons and the brain |journal=Science |volume=324 |issue=5929 |pages=929–30 |year=2009 |month=May |pmid=19372393 |doi=10.1126/science.1169786}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[glycosylation]] of uracil to produce the &quot;J-base&quot; in [[kinetoplastid]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ratel D, Ravanat J, Berger F, Wion D |title=N6-methyladenine: the other methylated base of DNA | journal=Bioessays |volume=28 |issue=3 | pages=309–15 |year=2006 |pmid=16479578 | doi = 10.1002/bies.20342 |pmc=2754416}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gommers-Ampt J, Van Leeuwen F, de Beer A, Vliegenthart J, Dizdaroglu M, Kowalak J, Crain P, Borst P |title=beta-D-glucosyl-hydroxymethyluracil: a novel modified base present in the DNA of the parasitic protozoan T. brucei | journal=Cell |volume=75 |issue=6 | pages=1129–36 |year=1993 |pmid=8261512 |doi=10.1016/0092-8674(93)90322-H}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DNA can be damaged by many sorts of [[mutagen]]s, which change the DNA sequence. Mutagens include [[oxidizing agent]]s, [[Alkylation|alkylating agents]] and also high-energy [[electromagnetic radiation]] such as [[ultraviolet]] light and [[X-ray]]s. The type of DNA damage produced depends on the type of mutagen. For example, UV light can damage DNA by producing [[thymine dimer]]s, which are cross-links between pyrimidine bases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Douki T, Reynaud-Angelin A, Cadet J, Sage E |title=Bipyrimidine photoproducts rather than oxidative lesions are the main type of DNA damage involved in the genotoxic effect of solar UVA radiation | journal=Biochemistry |volume=42 |issue=30 | pages=9221–6 |year=2003 |pmid=12885257 | doi = 10.1021/bi034593c}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, oxidants such as [[Radical (chemistry)|free radicals]] or [[hydrogen peroxide]] produce multiple forms of damage, including base modifications, particularly of guanosine, and double-strand breaks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Cadet J, Delatour T, Douki T, Gasparutto D, Pouget J, Ravanat J, Sauvaigo S |title=Hydroxyl radicals and DNA base damage | journal=Mutat Res |volume=424 |issue=1–2 | pages=9–21 |year=1999 |pmid=10064846}}&lt;/ref&gt; A typical human cell contains about 150,000 bases that have suffered oxidative damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Beckman KB, Ames BN |title=Oxidative decay of DNA |journal=J.

Many mutagens fit into the space between two adjacent base pairs, this is called [[intercalation (chemistry)|''intercalation'']]. Most intercalators are [[aromaticity|aromatic]] and planar molecules; examples include [[ethidium bromide]], [[Daunorubicin|daunomycin]], and [[doxorubicin]]. In order for an intercalator to fit between base pairs, the bases must separate, distorting the DNA strands by unwinding of the double helix. This inhibits both transcription and DNA replication, causing toxicity and mutations. As a result, DNA intercalators are often [[carcinogen]]s, and [[benzo(a)pyrene|benzo[''a'']pyrene diol epoxide]], [[acridine]]s, [[aflatoxin]] and [[ethidium bromide]] are well-known examples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ferguson L, Denny W |title=The genetic toxicology of acridines | journal=Mutat Res |volume=258 |issue=2 | pages=123–60 |year=1991 |pmid=1881402}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jeffrey A |title=DNA modification by chemical carcinogens | journal=Pharmacol Ther |volume=28 |issue=2 | pages=237–72 |year=1985 |pmid=3936066 |doi=10.1016/0163-7258(85)90013-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Stephens T, Bunde C, Fillmore B |title=Mechanism of action in thalidomide teratogenesis |journal=Biochem Pharmacol |volume=59 |issue=12 |pages=1489–99 |year=2000 |pmid=10799645 |doi=10.1016/S0006-2952(99)00388-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, due to their ability to inhibit DNA transcription and replication, other similar toxins are also used in [[chemotherapy]] to inhibit rapidly growing [[cancer]] cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Braña M, Cacho M, Gradillas A, de Pascual-Teresa B, Ramos A |title=Intercalators as anticancer drugs | journal=Curr Pharm Des |volume=7 |issue=17 | pages=1745–80 |year=2001 |pmid=11562309 |doi=10.2174/1381612013397113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biological functions==
DNA usually occurs as linear [[chromosome]]s in [[eukaryote]]s, and circular chromosomes in [[prokaryote]]s. The set of chromosomes in a cell makes up its [[genome]]; the [[human genome]] has approximately 3 billion base pairs of DNA arranged into 46 chromosomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Venter J |title=The sequence of the human genome | journal=Science |volume=291 |issue=5507 | pages=1304–51 |year=2001 |pmid=11181995 |doi=10.1126/science.1058040 |last2=Adams |first2=MD |last3=Myers |first3=EW |last4=Li |first4=PW |last5=Mural |first5=RJ |last6=Sutton |first6=GG |last7=Smith |first7=HO |last8=Yandell |first8=M |last9=Evans |first9=CA}}&lt;/ref&gt; The information carried by DNA is held in the [[DNA sequence|sequence]] of pieces of DNA called [[gene]]s. [[Transmission (genetics)|Transmission]] of genetic information in genes is achieved via complementary base pairing. For example, in transcription, when a cell uses the information in a gene, the DNA sequence is copied into a complementary RNA sequence through the attraction between the DNA and the correct RNA nucleotides. Usually, this RNA copy is then used to make a matching [[Peptide sequence|protein sequence]] in a process called [[Translation (biology)|translation]], which depends on the same interaction between RNA nucleotides. In alternative fashion, a cell may simply copy its genetic information in a process called DNA replication. The details of these functions are covered in other articles; here we focus on the interactions between DNA and other molecules that mediate the function of the genome.

===Genes and genomes===
{{Further|[[Cell nucleus]], [[Chromatin]], [[Chromosome]], [[Gene]], [[Noncoding DNA]]}}
Genomic DNA is tightly and orderly packed in the process called [[DNA condensation]] to fit the small available volumes of the cell. In eukaryotes, DNA is located in the [[cell nucleus]], as well as small amounts in [[mitochondrion|mitochondria]] and [[chloroplast]]s. In prokaryotes, the DNA is held within an irregularly shaped body in the cytoplasm called the [[nucleoid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Thanbichler M, Wang S, Shapiro L |title=The bacterial nucleoid: a highly organized and dynamic structure | journal=J Cell Biochem |volume=96 |issue=3 | pages=506–21 |year=2005 |pmid=15988757 | doi = 10.1002/jcb.20519}}&lt;/ref&gt; The genetic information in a genome is held within genes, and the complete set of this information in an organism is called its [[genotype]]. A gene is a unit of [[heredity]] and is a region of DNA that influences a particular characteristic in an organism. Genes contain an [[open reading frame]] that can be transcribed, as well as [[regulatory sequence]]s such as [[promoter (biology)|promoter]]s and [[enhancer (genetics)|enhancers]], which control the transcription of the open reading frame.

In many [[species]], only a small fraction of the total sequence of the [[genome]] encodes protein. For example, only about 1.5% of the human genome consists of protein-coding [[exon]]s, with over 50% of human DNA consisting of non-coding [[repeated sequence (DNA)|repetitive sequences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wolfsberg T, McEntyre J, Schuler G |title=Guide to the draft human genome | journal=Nature |volume=409 |issue=6822 | pages=824–6 |year=2001 |pmid=11236998 | doi = 10.1038/35057000}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reasons for the presence of so much [[noncoding DNA]] in eukaryotic genomes and the extraordinary differences in [[genome size]], or ''[[C-value]]'', among species represent a long-standing puzzle known as the &quot;[[C-value enigma]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gregory T |title=The C-value enigma in plants and animals: a review of parallels and an appeal for partnership | url=http://aob.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/95/1/133 | journal=Ann Bot (Lond) |volume=95 |issue=1 | pages=133–46 |year=2005 |pmid=15596463 |doi=10.1093/aob/mci009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, DNA sequences that do not code protein may still encode functional [[non-coding RNA]] molecules, which are involved in the [[regulation of gene expression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=The ENCODE Project Consortium |title=Identification and analysis of functional elements in 1% of the human genome by the ENCODE pilot project |journal=Nature |volume=447 |issue=7146 | pages =799–816 |year=2007 |doi=10.1038/nature05874 |pmid=17571346 |pmc=2212820}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some noncoding DNA sequences play structural roles in chromosomes. [[Telomere]]s and [[centromere]]s typically contain few genes, but are important for the function and stability of chromosomes.&lt;ref name=Nugent/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pidoux A, Allshire R |title=The role of heterochromatin in centromere function | pmc=1569473 | journal=Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci |volume=360 |issue=1455 | pages=569–79 |year=2005 |pmid=15905142 | doi = 10.1098/rstb.2004.1611}}&lt;/ref&gt; An abundant form of noncoding DNA in humans are [[pseudogene]]s, which are copies of genes that have been disabled by mutation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Harrison P, Hegyi H, Balasubramanian S, Luscombe N, Bertone P, Echols N, Johnson T, Gerstein M |title=Molecular fossils in the human genome: identification and analysis of the pseudogenes in chromosomes 21 and 22 | url=http://www.genome.org/cgi/content/full/12/2/272 | journal=Genome Res |volume=12 |issue=2 | pages=272–80 |year=2002 |pmid=11827946 |doi=10.1101/gr.207102 |pmc=155275}}&lt;/ref&gt; These sequences are usually just molecular [[fossil]]s, although they can occasionally serve as raw genetic material for the creation of new genes through the process of [[gene duplication]] and [[divergent evolution|divergence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Harrison P, Gerstein M |title=Studying genomes through the aeons: protein families, pseudogenes and proteome evolution | journal=J Mol Biol |volume=318 |issue=5 | pages=1155–74 |year=2002 |pmid=12083509 |doi=10.1016/S0022-2836(02)00109-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transcription and translation===
{{Further|[[Genetic code]], [[Transcription (genetics)]], [[Protein biosynthesis]]}}
A gene is a sequence of DNA that contains genetic information and can influence the [[phenotype]] of an organism. Within a gene, the sequence of bases along a DNA strand defines a [[messenger RNA]] sequence, which then defines one or more protein sequences. The relationship between the nucleotide sequences of genes and the [[amino acid|amino-acid]] sequences of proteins is determined by the rules of [[Translation (biology)|translation]], known collectively as the [[genetic code]]. The genetic code consists of three-letter 'words' called ''codons'' formed from a sequence of three nucleotides (e.g. ACT, CAG, TTT).

In transcription, the codons of a gene are copied into messenger RNA by [[RNA polymerase]]. This RNA copy is then decoded by a [[ribosome]] that reads the RNA sequence by base-pairing the messenger RNA to [[transfer RNA]], which carries amino acids. Since there are 4 bases in 3-letter combinations, there are 64 possible codons (&lt;math&gt;4^3&lt;/math&gt; combinations). These encode the twenty [[list of standard amino acids|standard amino acids]], giving most amino acids more than one possible codon. There are also three 'stop' or 'nonsense' codons signifying the end of the coding region; these are the TAA, TGA and TAG codons.

[[File:DNA replication en.svg|thumb|450px|right|DNA replication. The double helix is unwound by a [[helicase]] and [[topoisomerase]]. Next, one [[DNA polymerase]] produces the [[Replication fork|leading strand]] copy. Another DNA polymerase binds to the [[Replication fork|lagging strand]]. This enzyme makes discontinuous segments (called [[Okazaki fragment]]s) before [[DNA ligase]] joins them together.]]

===Replication===
{{Further|[[DNA replication]]}}

[[Cell division]] is essential for an organism to grow, but, when a cell divides, it must replicate the DNA in its genome so that the two daughter cells have the same genetic information as their parent. The double-stranded structure of DNA provides a simple mechanism for [[DNA replication]]. Here, the two strands are separated and then each strand's [[complementary DNA]] sequence is recreated by an [[enzyme]] called [[DNA polymerase]]. This enzyme makes the complementary strand by finding the correct base through complementary base pairing, and bonding it onto the original strand. As DNA polymerases can only extend a DNA strand in a 5′ to 3′ direction, different mechanisms are used to copy the antiparallel strands of the double helix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Albà M |title=Replicative DNA polymerases | journal=Genome Biol |volume=2 |issue=1 | pages=REVIEWS3002 |year=2001 |pmid=11178285 |pmc=150442 |url=http://genomebiology.com/1465-6906/2/REVIEWS3002 |doi=10.1186/gb-2001-2-1-reviews3002 |nopp=true}}{{dead link|date=February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, the base on the old strand dictates which base appears on the new strand, and the cell ends up with a perfect copy of its DNA.

==Interactions with proteins==
All the functions of DNA depend on interactions with proteins. These [[protein interactions]] can be non-specific, or the protein can bind specifically to a single DNA sequence. Enzymes can also bind to DNA and of these, the polymerases that copy the DNA base sequence in transcription and DNA replication are particularly important.

Structural proteins that bind DNA are well-understood examples of non-specific DNA-protein interactions. Within chromosomes, DNA is held in complexes with structural proteins. These proteins organize the DNA into a compact structure called [[chromatin]]. In eukaryotes this structure involves DNA binding to a complex of small basic proteins called [[histone]]s, while in prokaryotes multiple types of proteins are involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sandman K, Pereira S, Reeve J |title=Diversity of prokaryotic chromosomal proteins and the origin of the nucleosome | journal=Cell Mol Life Sci |volume=54 |issue=12 | pages=1350–64 |year=1998 |pmid=9893710 |doi=10.1007/s000180050259}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dame RT |title=The role of nucleoid-associated proteins in the organization and compaction of bacterial chromatin |journal=Mol.

These non-specific interactions are formed through basic residues in the histones making [[ionic bond]]s to the acidic sugar-phosphate backbone of the DNA, and are therefore largely independent of the base sequence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Luger K, Mäder A, Richmond R, Sargent D, Richmond T |title=Crystal structure of the nucleosome core particle at 2.8 A resolution | journal=Nature |volume=389 |issue=6648 | pages=251–60 |year=1997 |pmid=9305837 | doi = 10.1038/38444}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chemical modifications of these basic amino acid residues include [[methylation]], [[phosphorylation]] and [[acetylation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jenuwein T, Allis C |title=Translating the histone code | journal=Science |volume=293 |issue=5532 | pages=1074–80 |year=2001 |pmid=11498575 |doi=10.1126/science.1063127}}&lt;/ref&gt; These chemical changes alter the strength of the interaction between the DNA and the histones, making the DNA more or less accessible to [[transcription factor]]s and changing the rate of transcription.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ito T |title=Nucleosome assembly and remodelling | journal=Curr Top Microbiol Immunol |volume=274 | pages=1–22 |pmid=12596902 |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other non-specific DNA-binding proteins in chromatin include the high-mobility group proteins, which bind to bent or distorted DNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Thomas J |title=HMG1 and 2: architectural DNA-binding proteins | journal=Biochem Soc Trans |volume=29 |issue=Pt 4 | pages=395–401 |year=2001 |pmid=11497996 |doi=10.1042/BST0290395}}&lt;/ref&gt; These proteins are important in bending arrays of nucleosomes and arranging them into the larger structures that make up chromosomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Grosschedl R, Giese K, Pagel J |title=HMG domain proteins: architectural elements in the assembly of nucleoprotein structures | journal=Trends Genet |volume=10 |issue=3 | pages=94–100 |year=1994 |pmid=8178371 |doi=10.1016/0168-9525(94)90232-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A distinct group of DNA-binding proteins are the DNA-binding proteins that specifically bind single-stranded DNA. In humans, replication [[protein A]] is the best-understood member of this family and is used in processes where the double helix is separated, including DNA replication, recombination and DNA repair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Iftode C, Daniely Y, Borowiec J |title=Replication protein A (RPA): the eukaryotic SSB | journal=Crit Rev Biochem Mol Biol |volume=34 |issue=3 | pages=141–80 |year=1999 |pmid=10473346 |doi=10.1080/10409239991209255}}&lt;/ref&gt; These binding proteins seem to stabilize single-stranded DNA and protect it from forming [[stem-loop]]s or being degraded by [[nuclease]]s.

In contrast, other proteins have evolved to bind to particular DNA sequences. The most intensively studied of these are the various [[transcription factor]]s, which are proteins that regulate transcription. Each transcription factor binds to one particular set of DNA sequences and activates or inhibits the transcription of genes that have these sequences close to their promoters. The transcription factors do this in two ways. Firstly, they can bind the RNA polymerase responsible for transcription, either directly or through other mediator proteins; this locates the polymerase at the promoter and allows it to begin transcription.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Myers L, Kornberg R |title=Mediator of transcriptional regulation | journal=Annu Rev Biochem |volume=69 | pages=729–49 |year=2000 |pmid=10966474 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.biochem.69.1.729}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, transcription factors can bind [[enzyme]]s that modify the histones at the promoter; this will change the accessibility of the DNA template to the polymerase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Spiegelman B, Heinrich R |title=Biological control through regulated transcriptional coactivators | journal=Cell |volume=119 |issue=2 | pages=157–67 |year=2004 |pmid=15479634 |doi=10.1016/j.cell.2004.09.037}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As these DNA targets can occur throughout an organism's genome, changes in the activity of one type of transcription factor can affect thousands of genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Li Z, Van Calcar S, Qu C, Cavenee W, Zhang M, Ren B |title=A global transcriptional regulatory role for c-Myc in Burkitt's lymphoma cells | journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA |volume=100 |issue=14 | pages=8164–9 |year=2003 |pmid=12808131 |pmc=166200 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1332764100 |url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=12808131}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, these proteins are often the targets of the [[signal transduction]] processes that control responses to environmental changes or [[cellular differentiation]] and development. The specificity of these transcription factors' interactions with DNA come from the proteins making multiple contacts to the edges of the DNA bases, allowing them to &quot;read&quot; the DNA sequence. Most of these base-interactions are made in the major groove, where the bases are most accessible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pabo C, Sauer R |title=Protein-DNA recognition | journal=Annu Rev Biochem |volume=53 | pages=293–321 |year=1984 |pmid=6236744 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.bi.53.070184.001453}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===DNA-modifying enzymes===
====Nucleases and ligases====
[[Nuclease]]s are [[enzyme]]s that cut DNA strands by catalyzing the [[hydrolysis]] of the [[phosphodiester bond]]s. Nucleases that hydrolyse nucleotides from the ends of DNA strands are called [[exonuclease]]s, while [[endonuclease]]s cut within strands. The most frequently used nucleases in [[molecular biology]] are the [[restriction enzyme|restriction endonucleases]], which cut DNA at specific sequences. For instance, the EcoRV enzyme shown to the left recognizes the 6-base sequence 5′-GAT|ATC-3′ and makes a cut at the vertical line. In nature, these enzymes protect [[bacteria]] against [[Bacteriophage|phage]] infection by digesting the phage DNA when it enters the bacterial cell, acting as part of the [[restriction modification system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bickle T, Krüger D |title=Biology of DNA restriction |pmc=372918 | journal=Microbiol Rev |volume=57 |issue=2 | pages=434–50 |year=1993 |pmid=8336674}}&lt;/ref&gt; In technology, these sequence-specific nucleases are used in [[molecular cloning]] and [[Genetic fingerprinting|DNA fingerprinting]].

Enzymes called [[DNA ligase]]s can rejoin cut or broken DNA strands.&lt;ref name=Doherty&gt;{{cite journal |author=Doherty A, Suh S |title=Structural and mechanistic conservation in DNA ligases | journal=Nucleic Acids Res |volume=28 |issue=21 | pages=4051–8 |year=2000 |pmid=11058099 |pmc=113121 |doi=10.1093/nar/28.21.4051 |url=http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=11058099}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ligases are particularly important in [[Replication fork|lagging strand]] DNA replication, as they join together the short segments of DNA produced at the [[replication fork]] into a complete copy of the DNA template. They are also used in [[DNA repair]] and [[genetic recombination]].&lt;ref name=Doherty/&gt;

====Topoisomerases and helicases====
[[Topoisomerase]]s are enzymes with both nuclease and ligase activity. These proteins change the amount of [[DNA supercoil|supercoiling]] in DNA. Some of these enzymes work by cutting the DNA helix and allowing one section to rotate, thereby reducing its level of supercoiling; the enzyme then seals the DNA break.&lt;ref name=Champoux/&gt; Other types of these enzymes are capable of cutting one DNA helix and then passing a second strand of DNA through this break, before rejoining the helix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Schoeffler A, Berger J |title=Recent advances in understanding structure-function relationships in the type II topoisomerase mechanism | journal=Biochem Soc Trans |volume=33 |issue=Pt 6 | pages=1465–70 |year=2005 |pmid=16246147 |doi=10.1042/BST20051465}}&lt;/ref&gt; Topoisomerases are required for many processes involving DNA, such as DNA replication and transcription.&lt;ref name=Wang/&gt;

[[Helicase]]s are proteins that are a type of [[molecular motor]]. They use the chemical energy in [[nucleoside triphosphate]]s, predominantly [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]], to break hydrogen bonds between bases and unwind the DNA double helix into single strands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Tuteja N, Tuteja R |title=Unraveling DNA helicases. Motif, structure, mechanism and function | doi= 10.1111/j.1432-1033.2004.04094.x | journal=Eur J Biochem |volume=271 |issue=10 | pages=1849–63 |year=2004 |pmid=15128295}}&lt;/ref&gt; These enzymes are essential for most processes where enzymes need to access the DNA bases.

====Polymerases====
[[Polymerase]]s are [[enzyme]]s that synthesize polynucleotide chains from [[nucleoside triphosphate]]s. The sequence of their products are copies of existing polynucleotide chains – which are called ''templates''. These enzymes function by adding nucleotides onto the 3′ [[hydroxyl|hydroxyl group]] of the previous nucleotide in a DNA strand. As a consequence, all polymerases work in a 5′ to 3′ direction.&lt;ref name=Joyce&gt;{{cite journal |author=Joyce C, Steitz T |title=Polymerase structures and function: variations on a theme? |pmc=177480 | journal=J Bacteriol |volume=177 |issue=22 | pages=6321–9 |year=1995 |pmid=7592405}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[active site]] of these enzymes, the incoming nucleoside triphosphate base-pairs to the template: this allows polymerases to accurately synthesize the complementary strand of their template. Polymerases are classified according to the type of template that they use.

In DNA replication, a DNA-dependent [[DNA polymerase]] makes a copy of a DNA sequence. Accuracy is vital in this process, so many of these polymerases have a [[Proofreading (Biology)|proofreading]] activity. Here, the polymerase recognizes the occasional mistakes in the synthesis reaction by the lack of base pairing between the mismatched nucleotides. If a mismatch is detected, a 3′ to 5′ [[exonuclease]] activity is activated and the incorrect base removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hubscher U, Maga G, Spadari S |title=Eukaryotic DNA polymerases | journal=Annu Rev Biochem |volume=71 | pages=133–63 |year=2002 |pmid=12045093 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.biochem.71.090501.150041}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most organisms, DNA polymerases function in a large complex called the [[replisome]] that contains multiple accessory subunits, such as the [[DNA clamp]] or [[helicase]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Johnson A, O'Donnell M |title=Cellular DNA replicases: components and dynamics at the replication fork | journal=Annu Rev Biochem |volume=74 | pages=283–315 |year=2005 |pmid=15952889 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.biochem.73.011303.073859}}&lt;/ref&gt;

RNA-dependent DNA polymerases are a specialized class of polymerases that copy the sequence of an RNA strand into DNA. They include [[reverse transcriptase]], which is a [[virus|viral]] enzyme involved in the infection of cells by [[retrovirus]]es, and [[telomerase]], which is required for the replication of telomeres.&lt;ref name=Greider/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Tarrago-Litvak L, Andréola M, Nevinsky G, Sarih-Cottin L, Litvak S |title=The reverse transcriptase of HIV-1: from enzymology to therapeutic intervention | url=http://www.fasebj.org/cgi/reprint/8/8/497 | journal=FASEB J |volume=8 |issue=8 | pages=497–503 |date=1 May 1994|pmid=7514143 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Telomerase is an unusual polymerase because it contains its own RNA template as part of its structure.&lt;ref name=Nugent/&gt;

Transcription is carried out by a DNA-dependent [[RNA polymerase]] that copies the sequence of a DNA strand into RNA. To begin transcribing a gene, the RNA polymerase binds to a sequence of DNA called a promoter and separates the DNA strands. It then copies the gene sequence into a [[messenger RNA]] transcript until it reaches a region of DNA called the [[terminator (genetics)|terminator]], where it halts and detaches from the DNA. As with human DNA-dependent DNA polymerases, [[RNA polymerase II]], the enzyme that transcribes most of the genes in the human genome, operates as part of a large [[protein complex]] with multiple regulatory and accessory subunits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Martinez E |title=Multi-protein complexes in eukaryotic gene transcription | journal=Plant Mol Biol |volume=50 |issue=6 | pages=925–47 |year=2002 |pmid=12516863 |doi=10.1023/A:1021258713850}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Further|[[Genetic recombination]]}}
[[File:Chromosomal Recombination.svg|thumb|250px|left|Recombination involves the breakage and rejoining of two chromosomes (M and F) to produce two re-arranged chromosomes (C1 and C2).]]

A DNA helix usually does not interact with other segments of DNA, and in human cells the different chromosomes even occupy separate areas in the nucleus called &quot;chromosome territories&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Cremer T, Cremer C |title=Chromosome territories, nuclear architecture and gene regulation in mammalian cells | journal=Nat Rev Genet |volume=2 |issue=4 | pages=292–301 |year=2001 |pmid=11283701 | doi = 10.1038/35066075}}&lt;/ref&gt; This physical separation of different chromosomes is important for the ability of DNA to function as a stable repository for information, as one of the few times chromosomes interact is during [[chromosomal crossover]] when they [[genetic recombination|recombine]]. Chromosomal crossover is when two DNA helices break, swap a section and then rejoin.

Recombination allows chromosomes to exchange genetic information and produces new combinations of genes, which increases the efficiency of [[natural selection]] and can be important in the rapid evolution of new proteins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pál C, Papp B, Lercher M |title=An integrated view of protein evolution | journal=Nat Rev Genet |volume=7 |issue=5 | pages=337–48 |year=2006 |pmid=16619049 | doi = 10.1038/nrg1838}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genetic recombination can also be involved in DNA repair, particularly in the cell's response to double-strand breaks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=O'Driscoll M, Jeggo P |title=The role of double-strand break repair – insights from human genetics | journal=Nat Rev Genet |volume=7 |issue=1 | pages=45–54 |year=2006 |pmid=16369571 | doi = 10.1038/nrg1746}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common form of chromosomal crossover is [[homologous recombination]], where the two chromosomes involved share very similar sequences. Non-homologous recombination can be damaging to cells, as it can produce [[chromosomal translocation]]s and genetic abnormalities. The recombination reaction is catalyzed by enzymes known as [[recombinase]]s, such as [[RAD51]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Vispé S, Defais M |title=Mammalian Rad51 protein: a RecA homologue with pleiotropic functions |journal=Biochimie |volume=79 |issue=9–10 |pages=587–92 |year=1997 |pmid=9466696 |doi=10.1016/S0300-9084(97)82007-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first step in recombination is a double-stranded break either caused by an [[endonuclease]] or damage to the DNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Neale MJ, Keeney S |title=Clarifying the mechanics of DNA strand exchange in meiotic recombination |journal=Nature |volume=442 |issue=7099 |pages=153–8 |year=2006 |pmid=16838012 | doi = 10.1038/nature04885}}&lt;/ref&gt; A series of steps catalyzed in part by the recombinase then leads to joining of the two helices by at least one [[Holliday junction]], in which a segment of a single strand in each helix is annealed to the complementary strand in the other helix. The Holliday junction is a tetrahedral junction structure that can be moved along the pair of chromosomes, swapping one strand for another. The recombination reaction is then halted by cleavage of the junction and re-ligation of the released DNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dickman M, Ingleston S, Sedelnikova S, Rafferty J, Lloyd R, Grasby J, Hornby D |title=The RuvABC resolvasome | journal=Eur J Biochem |volume=269 |issue=22 | pages=5492–501 |year=2002 |pmid=12423347 |doi=10.1046/j.1432-1033.2002.03250.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution==
{{Further|[[RNA world hypothesis]]}}
DNA contains the genetic information that allows all modern living things to function, grow and reproduce. However, it is unclear how long in the 4-billion-year [[Timeline of evolution|history of life]] DNA has performed this function, as it has been proposed that the earliest forms of life may have used RNA as their genetic material.&lt;ref name=Joyce&gt;{{cite journal |author=Joyce G |title=The antiquity of RNA-based evolution |journal=Nature |volume=418 |issue=6894 |pages=214–21 |year=2002 |pmid=12110897 | doi = 10.1038/418214a}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Orgel L |title=Prebiotic chemistry and the origin of the RNA world | url=http://www.crbmb.com/cgi/reprint/39/2/99.pdf |journal=Crit Rev Biochem Mol Biol |volume=39 |issue=2 |pages=99–123 |pmid=15217990 | doi = 10.1080/10409230490460765|format=PDF |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; RNA may have acted as the central part of early [[cell metabolism]] as it can both transmit genetic information and carry out [[catalysis]] as part of [[ribozyme]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Davenport R |title=Ribozymes.

This would occur, since the number of different bases in such an organism is a trade-off between a small number of bases increasing replication accuracy and a large number of bases increasing the catalytic efficiency of ribozymes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Szathmáry E |title=What is the optimum size for the genetic alphabet? |url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/reprint/89/7/2614.pdf |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA |volume=89 |issue=7 |pages=2614–8 |year=1992 |pmid=1372984 |doi=10.1073/pnas.89.7.2614|format=PDF |pmc=48712}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there is no direct evidence of ancient genetic systems, as recovery of DNA from most fossils is impossible. This is because DNA will survive in the environment for less than one million years and slowly degrades into short fragments in solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lindahl T |title=Instability and decay of the primary structure of DNA |journal=Nature |volume=362 |issue=6422 |pages=709–15 |year=1993 |pmid=8469282 | doi = 10.1038/362709a0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Claims for older DNA have been made, most notably a report of the isolation of a viable bacterium from a salt crystal 250 million years old,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Vreeland R, Rosenzweig W, Powers D |title=Isolation of a 250 million-year-old halotolerant bacterium from a primary salt crystal |journal=Nature |volume=407 |issue=6806 |pages=897–900 |year=2000 |pmid=11057666 | doi = 10.1038/35038060}}&lt;/ref&gt; but these claims are controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hebsgaard M, Phillips M, Willerslev E |title=Geologically ancient DNA: fact or artefact? |journal=Trends Microbiol |volume=13 |issue=5 |pages=212–20 |year=2005 |pmid=15866038 |doi=10.1016/j.tim.2005.03.010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Nickle D, Learn G, Rain M, Mullins J, Mittler J |title=Curiously modern DNA for a &quot;250 million-year-old&quot; bacterium |journal=J Mol Evol |volume=54 |issue=1 |pages=134–7 |year=2002 |pmid=11734907 | doi = 10.1007/s00239-001-0025-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses in technology==
===Genetic engineering===
{{Further|[[Molecular biology]], [[nucleic acid methods]] and [[genetic engineering]]}}
Methods have been developed to purify DNA from organisms, such as [[phenol-chloroform extraction]], and to manipulate it in the laboratory, such as [[restriction digest]]s and the [[polymerase chain reaction]]. Modern [[biology]] and [[biochemistry]] make intensive use of these techniques in recombinant DNA technology. [[Recombinant DNA]] is a man-made DNA sequence that has been assembled from other DNA sequences. They can be [[transformation (genetics)|transformed]] into organisms in the form of [[plasmid]]s or in the appropriate format, by using a [[viral vector]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Goff SP, Berg P |title=Construction of hybrid viruses containing SV40 and lambda phage DNA segments and their propagation in cultured monkey cells |journal=Cell |volume=9 |issue=4 PT 2 |pages=695–705 |year=1976 |pmid=189942 |doi=10.1016/0092-8674(76)90133-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[genetic engineering|genetically modified]] organisms produced can be used to produce products such as recombinant [[protein]]s, used in [[medical research]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Houdebine L |title=Transgenic animal models in biomedical research |journal=Methods Mol Biol |volume=360 |pages=163–202 |pmid=17172731 |year=2007 |doi=10.1385/1-59745-165-7:163}}&lt;/ref&gt; or be grown in [[agriculture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Daniell H, Dhingra A |title=Multigene engineering: dawn of an exciting new era in biotechnology |journal=Curr Opin Biotechnol |volume=13 |issue=2 |pages=136–41 |year=2002 |pmid=11950565 |doi=10.1016/S0958-1669(02)00297-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Job D |title=Plant biotechnology in agriculture |journal=Biochimie |volume=84 |issue=11 |pages=1105–10 |year=2002 |pmid=12595138 |doi=10.1016/S0300-9084(02)00013-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Forensics===
{{Further|[[DNA profiling]]}}

[[Forensic science|Forensic scientists]] can use DNA in [[blood]], [[semen]], [[skin]], [[saliva]] or [[hair]] found at a [[crime scene]] to identify a matching DNA of an individual, such as a perpetrator. This process is formally termed [[DNA profiling]], but may also be called &quot;[[genetic fingerprinting]]&quot;. In DNA profiling, the lengths of variable sections of repetitive DNA, such as [[short tandem repeat]]s and [[minisatellite]]s, are compared between people. This method is usually an extremely reliable technique for identifying a matching DNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Collins A, Morton N |title=Likelihood ratios for DNA identification | url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/reprint/91/13/6007.pdf | journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA |volume=91 |issue=13 | pages=6007–11 |year=1994 |pmid=8016106 |doi=10.1073/pnas.91.13.6007|format=PDF |pmc=44126}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, identification can be complicated if the scene is contaminated with DNA from several people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Weir B, Triggs C, Starling L, Stowell L, Walsh K, Buckleton J |title=Interpreting DNA mixtures | journal=J Forensic Sci |volume=42 |issue=2 | pages=213–22 |year=1997 |pmid=9068179}}&lt;/ref&gt; DNA profiling was developed in 1984 by British geneticist Sir [[Alec Jeffreys]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jeffreys A, Wilson V, Thein S |title=Individual-specific 'fingerprints' of human DNA | journal=Nature |volume=316 |issue=6023 | pages=76–9 |year=1985|pmid=2989708 |doi=10.1038/316076a0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and first used in forensic science to convict Colin Pitchfork in the 1988 [[Colin Pitchfork|Enderby murders]] case.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20061214004903/http://www.forensic.gov.uk/forensic_t/inside/news/list_casefiles.php?case=1 Colin Pitchfork — first murder conviction on DNA evidence also clears the prime suspect] Forensic Science Service Accessed 23 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

People convicted of certain types of crimes may be required to provide a sample of DNA for a database. This has helped investigators solve old cases where only a DNA sample was obtained from the scene. DNA profiling can also be used to identify victims of mass casualty incidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://massfatality.dna.gov/Introduction/ |title=DNA Identification in Mass Fatality Incidents |month=September | year=2006 |publisher=National Institute of Justice}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, many convicted people have been released from prison on the basis of DNA techniques, which were not available when a crime had originally been committed.

===Bioinformatics===
{{Further|[[Bioinformatics]]}}
[[Bioinformatics]] involves the manipulation, searching, and [[data mining]] of biological data, and this includes DNA sequence data. The development of techniques to store and search DNA sequences have led to widely applied advances in [[computer science]], especially [[string searching algorithm]]s, [[machine learning]] and [[database theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1=Baldi|first1= Pierre|author1-link=Pierre Baldi|last2= Brunak|first2= Soren | title=Bioinformatics: The Machine Learning Approach | publisher= MIT Press | year=2001| isbn=978-0-262-02506-5 | oclc=45951728 | author=Pierre Baldi; Søren Brunak.}}&lt;/ref&gt; String searching or matching algorithms, which find an occurrence of a sequence of letters inside a larger sequence of letters, were developed to search for specific sequences of nucleotides.&lt;ref&gt;Gusfield, Dan.

ISBN 978-0-521-58519-4.&lt;/ref&gt;  The DNA sequenced may be [[sequence alignment|aligned]] with other DNA sequences to identify [[homology (biology)|homologous]] sequences and locate the specific [[mutation]]s that make them distinct.

Regions of DNA sequence that have the characteristic patterns associated with protein- or RNA-coding genes can be identified by [[Gene prediction|gene finding]] algorithms, which allow researchers to predict the presence of particular [[gene product]]s and their possible functions in an organism even before they have been isolated experimentally.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mount&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author = Mount DM |title=Bioinformatics: Sequence and Genome Analysis | edition = 2 | publisher = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press | year = 2004 | isbn = 0-87969-712-1|oclc = 55106399|location=Cold Spring Harbor, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Entire genomes may also be compared which can shed light on the evolutionary history of particular organism and permit the examination of complex evolutionary events.

===History and anthropology===

DNA was first isolated by the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] physician [[Friedrich Miescher]] who, in 1869, discovered a microscopic substance in the [[pus]] of discarded surgical bandages. As it resided in the nuclei of cells, he called it &quot;nuclein&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dahm R |title=Discovering DNA: Friedrich Miescher and the early years of nucleic acid research |journal=Hum.

However, Levene thought the chain was short and the bases repeated in a fixed order.

In 1928, [[Frederick Griffith]] discovered that [[trait (biology)|traits]] of the &quot;smooth&quot; form of the ''Pneumococcus'' could be transferred to the &quot;rough&quot; form of the same bacteria by mixing killed &quot;smooth&quot; bacteria with the live &quot;rough&quot; form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lorenz MG, Wackernagel W |title=Bacterial gene transfer by natural genetic transformation in the environment |journal=Microbiol.

In 1953, [[James D.

In an influential presentation in 1957, Crick laid out the [[central dogma of molecular biology]], which foretold the relationship between DNA, RNA, and proteins, and articulated the &quot;adaptor hypothesis&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Crick, F.H.C.

In the [[United States]], the phrase '''Kennedy family''' commonly refers to the family descending from the marriage of the [[Irish American|Irish-Americans]] [[Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr.]] and [[Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy|Rose Elizabeth Fitzgerald]] that was prominent in [[Politics of the United States|American politics]] and government. Their political involvement has revolved around the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. [[Harvard University]] educations have been common among them, and they have contributed heavily to that university's [[John F. Kennedy School of Government]]. The wealth, glamour &lt;!--&quot;glamour&quot; is probably the more-common u.s. spelling (as in &quot;Glamour&quot; magazine)--&gt; and photogenic quality of the family members, as well as their extensive and continuing commitment to public service, has elevated them to [[Cultural icon|iconic]] status over the past half-century and has led to their reputation as &quot;America's Royal Family.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-86872042.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/08/21/sorensen.kennedy.family/index.html | work=CNN | title=Commentary: Kennedy family's remarkable story - CNN.com | accessdate=May 7, 2010 | date=August 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.capecodonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/section?category=SPECIAL18&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[United States presidential election, 1960|1960 election]] of [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[John F. Kennedy]], he and his two younger brothers, [[Robert F. Kennedy]] and [[Ted Kennedy|Edward M. Kennedy]], soon all held prominent positions in the federal government, and received intensive publicity, often emphasizing their youth (relative to comparably influential politicians), allure, education and collective future in politics. From 1947, when John F. Kennedy was first elected to Congress, to 2011, when [[Patrick J. Kennedy]] departed Congress, there was a 64-year run of a Kennedy family member holding an elective office in Washington.&lt;ref name=&quot;bg021310&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/rhode_island/articles/2010/02/13/pondering_a_congress_without_kennedys/ |title=Pondering a Congress without Kennedys |author=Levenson, Michael |newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=February 13, 2010 |accessdate=March 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This spans more than a quarter of the nation's existence.&lt;ref name=&quot;bg021310&quot;/&gt;

The family has suffered numerous tragedies known as &quot;[[Kennedy tragedies|the Kennedy curse]]&quot;, including the assassination of brothers [[John F. Kennedy assassination|John]] and [[Robert F. Kennedy assassination|Robert]], the controversial [[Chappaquiddick incident]], and four airplane crashes ([[Joseph P. Kennedy, Jr.|Joe, Jr.]], [[Kathleen Cavendish, Marchioness of Hartington|Kathleen]], Ted and [[John F. Kennedy, Jr.|John, Jr.]], all but Ted were fatal).

{{Kennedy family tree}}&lt;!--August 31, 2009 - this editor updated family tree template to include 2nd wife of Ted; however, did not yet update to include his 2 stepchildren - see hidden note in template article--&gt; 
----
===First generation===	
The family [[patriarch]] was [[P. J. Kennedy|Patrick J. Kennedy]] (1858–1929), a [[Immigrant generations#First generation immigrant|first-generation]] American who married [[Mary Augusta Hickey Kennedy|Mary Augusta Hickey]] (1857–1923). He was a politician involved in the local Democratic Party.

===Second generation===
In 1914, their son, [[Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr.]] (1888–1969) married [[Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy|Rose Fitzgerald]] (1890–1995), the daughter of [[List of mayors of Boston|Boston (Massachusetts) Mayor]] [[John F. Fitzgerald]]. Joseph served as the first chairman of the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] and as the [[United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom|U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom]] in the years leading up to [[World War II]].

===Third generation===
Together Joseph and Rose Kennedy had nine children:

{{Forms of government}}
{{Democracy}} 
'''Democracy''' is a form of government in which all citizens have an equal say in the decisions that affect their lives. Ideally, this includes equal (and more or less direct) participation in the proposal, development and passage of legislation into law. It can also encompass social, economic and cultural conditions that enable the free and equal practice of [[political freedom|political self-determination]]. The term comes from the {{lang-el|δημοκρατία}} – (''dēmokratía'') &quot;rule of the people&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20070914202111/http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0057:entry%3d%2324422 Demokratia, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, &quot;A Greek-English Lexicon&quot;, at Perseus]&lt;/ref&gt; which was coined from δῆμος (''dêmos'') &quot;people&quot; and κράτος (''Kratos'') &quot;power&quot;, in the middle of the 5th-4th century BC to denote the [[political systems]] then existing in some Greek city-states, notably [[Classical Athens|Athens]] following a popular uprising in [[508 BC]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC1&quot;&gt;Democracy is people who rule the government directly.[http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/greeks/greekdemocracy_01.shtml BBC History of democracy]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to some theories of democracy, [[popular sovereignty]] is the founding principle of such a system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Liberal Democracy and Political Islam: the Search for Common Ground|last=Benhenda|first=M.|url=http://ssrn.com/abstract=1475928|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the democratic principle has also been expressed as &quot;the freedom to call something into being which did not exist before, which was not given… and which therefore, strictly speaking, could not be known.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, &quot;What is Freedom?&quot;, ''Between Past and Future: Eight Exercises in Political Thought'', (New York: Penguin, 1993).&lt;/ref&gt; This type of freedom, which is connected to human &quot;natality,&quot; or the capacity to begin anew, sees democracy as &quot;not only a political system… [but] an ideal, an aspiration, really, intimately connected to and dependent upon a picture of what it is to be human—of what it is a human should be to be fully human.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Nikolas Kompridis, &quot;[http://www.parrhesiajournal.org/parrhesia08/parrhesia08_kompridis.pdf Technology's Challenge to Democracy,&quot; ''Parrhesia'' 8 (2009)], 31.&lt;/ref&gt; 

While there is no specific, universally accepted definition of 'democracy',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/markets/rankings/displaystory.cfm?story_id=8908438 Liberty and justice for some] at [[The Economist|Economist.com]]&lt;/ref&gt; equality and freedom have both been identified as important characteristics of democracy since ancient times.&lt;ref name=&quot;AristotlePol1317b&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0058%3Abook%3D6%3Asection%3D1317b |title=Aristotle, Politics.1317b (Book 6, Part II) |publisher=Perseus.tufts.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; These principles are reflected in all citizens being [[Equality before the law|equal before the law]] and having equal access to legislative processes. For example, in a representative democracy, every vote has equal weight, no unreasonable restrictions can apply to anyone seeking to become a representative, and the freedom of its citizens is secured by legitimized rights and liberties which are generally protected by a constitution.&lt;ref name=&quot;BKMIT&quot;&gt;R. Alan Dahl, I. Shapiro, J. A.

Hénaff, T. B. Strong, ''Public Space and Democracy'', University of Minnesota Press, ISBN 0816633878&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several varieties of democracy, some of which provide better representation and more freedom for their citizens than others.&lt;ref&gt;G. F. Gaus, C. Kukathas, ''Handbook of Political Theory'', SAGE, 2004, p. 143-145, ISBN 0761967877, [http://books.google.com/books?id=RGisaLxA6eMC Google Books link]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Judge in a Democracy'', Princeton University Press, 2006, p. 26, ISBN 069112017X, [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=3HX7mAbjGOYC Google Books link]&lt;/ref&gt; However, if any democracy is not structured so as to prohibit the government from excluding the people from the legislative process, or any branch of government from altering the [[separation of powers]] in its own favor, then a branch of the system can accumulate too much power and destroy the democracy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barak40&quot;&gt;A. Barak, ''The Judge in a Democracy'', Princeton University Press, 2006, p. 40, ISBN 069112017X, [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=3HX7mAbjGOYC Google Books link]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;T. R. Williamson, ''Problems in American Democracy'', Kessinger Publishing, 2004, p. 36, ISBN 1419143166, [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=NrUlR8nc9Q8C Google Books link]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;U. K. Preuss, &quot;Perspectives of Democracy and the Rule of Law.&quot; ''Journal of Law and Society'', 18:3 (1991). pp. 353–364&lt;/ref&gt; [[Representative Democracy]], [[Consensus Democracy]], and [[Deliberative Democracy]] are all major examples of attempts at a form of government that is both practical and responsive to the needs and desires of citizens.

Many people use the term &quot;democracy&quot; as shorthand for [[liberal democracy]], which may include elements such as [[political pluralism]]; [[rule of law|equality before the law]]; the [[right to petition]] elected officials for redress of grievances; [[due process]]; [[civil liberties]]; [[human rights]]; and elements of [[civil society]] outside the government. In the United States, separation of powers is often cited as a central attribute, but in other countries, such as the United Kingdom, the dominant principle is that of [[parliamentary sovereignty]] (though in practice [[judicial independence]] is generally maintained). In other cases, &quot;democracy&quot; is used to mean [[direct democracy]]. Though the term &quot;democracy&quot; is typically used in the context of a [[state (polity)|political state]], the principles are applicable to private [[organization]]s and other groups as well.

[[Majority rule]] is often listed as a characteristic of democracy. However, it is also possible for a [[minority]] to be oppressed by a &quot;[[tyranny of the majority]]&quot; in the absence of governmental or constitutional protections of individual and/or group rights. An essential part of an &quot;ideal&quot; representative democracy is competitive [[elections]] that are fair both substantively&lt;ref&gt;Substantive fairness means equality among all citizens in all relevant respects, i.e. equality of opportunity, social conditions, etc.&lt;/ref&gt; and procedurally.&lt;ref&gt;Procedural fairness means that the rules of the elections are clear, set out in advance, and do not privilege any group or individual over another.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, [[freedom (political)|freedom of political expression]], [[freedom of speech]], and [[freedom of the press]] are considered to be essential, so that citizens are adequately informed and able to vote according to their own best interests as they see them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barak27&quot;&gt;A. Barak,''The Judge in a Democracy'', Princeton University Press, 2006, p. 27, ISBN 069112017X, [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=3HX7mAbjGOYC Google Books link]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H. Kelsen, ''Ethics'', Vol. 66, No. 1, Part 2: Foundations of Democracy (Oct., 1955), pp. 1–101&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been suggested that a basic feature of democracy is the capacity of individuals to participate freely and fully in the life of their society.&lt;ref&gt;Martha Nussbaum, ''Women and human development: the capabilities approach'' (Cambridge University Press, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of democracy==
{{Main|History of democracy}}

===Ancient origins===
The term ''democracy'' first appeared in ancient Greek political and philosophical thought. The [[philosopher]] [[Plato]] contrasted democracy, the system of &quot;rule by the governed&quot;, with the alternative systems of [[monarchy]] (rule by one individual), [[oligarchy]] (rule by a small élite class) and [[timocracy]] (ruling class of property owners). Today Classical [[Athenian democracy]] is considered by many to have been a [[direct democracy]]. Originally it had two distinguishing features: first the [[sortition|allotment]] (selection by lot) of ordinary citizens to the few government offices and the courts,&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle Book 6&lt;/ref&gt; and secondarily the assembly of all the citizens.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.socionauki.ru/book/early_state_en/  Grinin L. E. Early State and Democraсy]&lt;/ref&gt;

All citizens were eligible to speak and vote in the assembly, which set the laws of the city-state. However,  Athenian citizens were all-male, born from parents who were born in Athens, and excluded [[women]], [[slaves]], foreigners (μέτοικοι / metoikoi) and males under 20 years old. Of the perhaps 250,000 inhabitants only a small [[plurality]] were citizens. The (elected) generals often held influence in the assembly. [[Pericles]] was, during his many years of de-facto political leadership, once elected general 15 years in a row.

A possible example of primitive democracy may have been the early [[Sumer]]ian city-states.&lt;ref name=Jacobsen&gt;Jacobsen, T. (July 1943), &quot;Primitive Democracy in Ancient Mesopotamia&quot;, ''[[Journal of Near Eastern Studies]]'' '''2'''(3): 159–72&lt;/ref&gt; A similar proto-democracy or oligarchy existed temporarily among the [[Medes]] (ancient Iranian people) in the 6th century BC, but which came to an end after the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid]] (Persian) Emperor [[Darius I of Persia|Darius the Great]] declared that the best monarchy was better than the best oligarchy or best democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Flight and Freedom in the Ancient Near East|first=Daniel C.|last=Snell|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|year=2001|isbn=9004120106|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the term &quot;democracy&quot; is not often used for civilizations outside of Europe in ancient times there were organizations of government very akin to democracy in some [[History of Africa|African]] societies&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=AxXE65flKPwC&amp;pg=PA555&amp;lpg=PA555&amp;dq=ancient+Africa+democracy&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=P7a2RVBWOK&amp;sig=UPNgjXDwmKNnE6mQLURfFticEgA&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=7hyrTZylJIm90QHUpsD5CA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=12&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwCw#v=onepage&amp;q=ancient%20Africa%20democracy&amp;f=false African intellectual heritage: a book of sources.

Paper presented at the Fourth Annual Kent State University Symposium on Democracy. by Apollos O. Nwauwa]&lt;/ref&gt;

A serious claim for early democratic institutions comes from the independent &quot;republics&quot; of [[India]], ''[[sangha]]s'' and ''[[gana]]s'', which existed as early as the 6th century BC and persisted in some areas until the 4th century AD.&lt;ref name=Muhlberger2011&gt;{{cite book|last=Steven Muhlberger, Republics and Quasi-Democratic Institutions in Ancient India in Ben Isakhan and Stephen Stockwell|title=The Secret History of Democracy|year=2011|publisher=Palgrave MacMillan |location=London| isbn=978-0-230-24421-4| pages=49–59}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The evidence is scattered and no pure historical source exists for that period. In addition, [[Diodorus]] (a Greek historian at the time of [[Alexander the Great]]'s excursion of India), without offering any detail, mentions that independent and democratic states existed in India.&lt;ref&gt;Dio. 2.39&lt;/ref&gt;  However, modern scholars note that the word ''democracy'' at the 3rd century BC and later had been degraded and could mean any autonomous state no matter how oligarchic it was.&lt;ref&gt;Larsen, 1973, pp. 45–46&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;de Sainte, 2006, pp. 321–3&lt;/ref&gt;  The lack of the concept of citizen equality across caste system boundaries has led many scholars to believe that the true nature of ''ganas'' and ''sanghas'' would not be comparable to that of truly democratic institutions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sharma&quot;&gt;Sharma 1968, pp. 109–22&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though the [[Roman Republic]] contributed significantly to certain aspects of democracy, only a minority of Romans were citizens with votes in elections for representatives. The votes of the powerful were given more weight through a system of [[Gerrymandering]], so most high officials, including members of the [[Roman Senate|Senate]], came from a few wealthy and noble families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://annourbis.com/Ancient-Rome/8rome10.html |title=Ancient Rome from the earliest times down to 476 A.D |publisher=Annourbis.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many notable exceptions did occur.

===Middle Ages===
During the [[Middle Ages]], there were various systems involving elections or assemblies, although often only involving a small amount of the population, the election of [[Gopala (Pala king)|Gopala]] in [[Bengal]], the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], the [[Althing]] in [[Iceland]], the [[Løgting]] in the [[Faroe Islands]], certain [[medieval Italy|medieval Italian]] city-states such as [[Venice]], the [[tuatha]] system in early medieval Ireland, the [[Veche]] in [[Novgorod Republic|Novgorod]] and [[Pskov Republic]]s of medieval Russia, [[Scandinavia]]n [[Thing (assembly)|Things]], [[The States]] in [[German Tyrol|Tirol]] and [[Switzerland]] and the autonomous merchant city of [[Sakai, Osaka|Sakai]] in the 16th century in Japan. However, participation was often restricted to a minority, and so may be better classified as [[oligarchy]]. Most regions in medieval Europe were ruled by clergy or feudal lords.

The [[Kouroukan Fouga]] or Kurukan Fuga is purported to be the [[constitution]] of the [[Mali Empire]] (mid-thirteenth century to c. 1645 CE), created after the [[Battle of Krina]] by an assembly of notables to create a government for the newly established empire. It was first alluded to in print in [[Djibril Tamsir Niane]]'s book, ''[[Epic of Sundiata|Soundjata, ou la Epoupée Mandingue]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Djibril Tamsir Niane, ''Soundjata ou l'Epoupée Mandingue'' (Paris, 1960).  English translation by G. D. Pickett as ''Sundiata:  An Epic of Old Mali'' (London, 1965) and subsequent reprinted editions.&lt;/ref&gt; The Kouroukan Fouga divided the new empire into ruling clans (lineages) that were represented at a great assembly called the ''Gbara''. However, the charter made Mali more similar to a [[constitutional monarchy]] than a democratic republic.

A little closer to modern democracy were the Cossack republics of Ukraine in the 16th–17th centuries: [[Cossack Hetmanate]] and [[Zaporizhian Sich]]. The highest post – the [[Hetmans of Ukrainian Cossacks|Hetman]] – was elected by the representatives from the country's districts. Because these states were very militarised, the right to participate in Hetman's elections was largely restricted to those who served in the Cossack Army and over time was curtailed effectively limiting these rights to higher army ranks.

[[Image:Magna Carta.jpg|right|200px|thumb|[[Magna Carta]], 1215, England]]
The [[Parliament of England]] had its roots in the restrictions on the power of kings written into [[Magna Carta]], explicitly protected certain rights of the King's subjects, whether free or fettered — and implicitly supported what became English writ of [[habeas corpus]], safeguarding individual freedom against unlawful imprisonment with right to appeal. The first elected parliament was [[De Montfort's Parliament]] in England in 1265.

However only a small minority actually had a voice; Parliament was elected by only a few percent of the population, (less than 3% as late as 1780&lt;ref name = &quot;nationalarchives&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pathways/citizenship/rise_parliament/making_history_rise.htm |title=Exhibitions &amp; Learning online &amp;#124; Citizenship &amp;#124; Struggle for democracy |publisher=The National Archives |date= |accessdate=2010-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and the power to call parliament was at the pleasure of the monarch (usually when he or she needed funds).  The power of Parliament increased in stages over the succeeding centuries.  After the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688, the [[English Bill of Rights]] of 1689 was enacted, which codified certain rights and increased the influence of Parliament.&lt;ref name = &quot;nationalarchives&quot;/&gt; The franchise was slowly increased and Parliament gradually gained more power until the monarch became largely a figurehead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pathways/citizenship/struggle_democracy/getting_vote.htm |title=Exhibitions &amp; Learning online &amp;#124; Citizenship &amp;#124; Rise of Parliament |publisher=The National Archives |date= |accessdate=2010-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As the franchise was increased, it also was made more uniform, as many so-called [[rotten boroughs]], with a handful of voters electing a Member of Parliament, were eliminated in the [[Reform Act of 1832]].

Democracy was also seen to a certain extent in [[band society|bands]] and [[tribe]]s such as the [[Iroquois Confederacy]]. However, in the Iroquois Confederacy only the males of certain clans could be leaders and some clans were excluded. Only the oldest females from the same clans could choose and remove the leaders. This excluded most of the population. An interesting detail is that there should be consensus among the leaders, not majority support decided by [[voting]], when making decisions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iroquoisdemocracy.pdx.edu/html/activity4.htm Activity Four]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rousseau|first=David|date=3 September 1995|title=Peaceful Democrats or Pragmatic Realists?: Revisiting the Iroquois League|journal=Annual Meeting of the American Political Science Association|url=http://www.ssc.upenn.edu/~rousseau/IRO.PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Band societies]], such as the [[Bushmen]], which usually number 20-50 people in the band often do not have leaders and make decisions based on consensus among the majority. In [[Melanesia]], farming village communities have traditionally been egalitarian and lacking in a rigid, authoritarian hierarchy. Although a [[Big man (anthropology)|&quot;Big man&quot;]] or &quot;Big woman&quot; could gain influence, that influence was conditional on a continued demonstration of leadership skills, and on the willingness of the community. Every person was expected to share in communal duties, and entitled to participate in communal decisions. However, strong social pressure encouraged conformity and discouraged individualism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://anglicanhistory.org/oceania/whonsbon-aston1961.html &quot;Melanesia Historical and Geographical: the Solomon Islands and the New Hebrides&quot;], ''Southern Cross'' n°1, London: 1950&lt;/ref&gt;

===18th and 19th centuries===
[[Image:Number of nations 1800-2003 scoring 8 or higher on Polity IV scale.png|thumb|right|350px|Number of nations 1800–2003 scoring 8 or higher on [[Polity IV]] scale, another widely used measure of democracy.]]
The first nation in modern history to adopt a democratic [[constitution]] was the short-lived [[Corsican Republic]] in 1755. This [[Corsican Constitution]] was the first based on [[Enlightenment]] principles and even allowed for [[female suffrage]], something that was granted in other democracies only by the twentieth century. Although not described as a democracy by the [[founding fathers of the united states|founding fathers]], the United States founders also shared a determination to root the American experiment in the principle of natural freedom and equality.
&lt;ref&gt;Jacqueline Newmyer, [http://www.oxonianreview.org/issues/2-2/2-2-6.htm &quot;Present from the start: John Adams and America&quot;], ''Oxonian Review of Books'', 2005, vol 4 issue 2&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[United States Constitution]], adopted in 1788, provided for an elected government and protected civil rights and liberties for some.

In the colonial period before 1776, and for some time after, only adult white male property owners could vote; enslaved Africans, free black people and women were not extended the franchise. On the [[Frontier Thesis|American frontier]], democracy became a way of life, with widespread social, economic and political equality.&lt;ref&gt;Ray Allen Billington, ''America's Frontier Heritage'' (1974) 117–158. ISBN 0826303102&lt;/ref&gt; However, slavery was a social and economic institution, particularly in eleven states in the American South, that a variety of organizations were established advocating the movement of black people from the United States to locations where they would enjoy greater freedom and equality.&lt;ref name=AFP&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fcnl.org/issues/item.php?item_id=731&amp;issue_id=75|title=Background on conflict in Liberia [[Paul Cuffee]] believed that African Americans could more easily &quot;rise to be a people&quot; in Africa than in the U.S. where slavery and legislated limits on black freedom were still in place. Although Cuffee died in 1817, his early efforts to help repatriate African Americans encouraged the [[American Colonization Society]] (ACS) to lead further settlements. The ACS was made up mostly of Quakers and slaveholders, who disagreed on the issue of slavery but found common ground in support of repatriation. Friends opposed slavery but believed blacks would face better chances for freedom in Africa than in the U.S. The slaveholders opposed freedom for blacks, but saw [[repatriation]] as a way of avoiding rebellions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1820s and 1830s the [[American Colonization Society]] (A.C.S.) was the primary vehicle for proposals to return black Americans to freedom in Africa, and in 1821 the A.C.S. established the colony of [[Liberia]], assisting thousands of former African-American slaves and free black people to move there from the United States.&lt;ref name=AFP/&gt; By the 1840s almost all property restrictions were ended and nearly all white adult male citizens could vote; and turnout averaged 60–80% in frequent elections for local, state and national officials. The system gradually evolved, from [[Jeffersonian Democracy]] to [[Jacksonian Democracy]] and beyond. In the [[1860 United States Census]] the slave population in the United States had grown to four million,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itd.nps.gov/cwss/manassas/social/introsoc.htm |title=Introduction – Social Aspects of the Civil War |publisher=Itd.nps.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] after the Civil War (late 1860s) the newly freed [[Abolitionism|slaves]] became citizens with (in the case of men) a nominal right to vote. Full enfranchisement of citizens was not secured until after the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955–1968)]]  gained passage by the United States Congress of the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]].

[[Image:Suffrage universel 1848.jpg|thumb|300px|The establishment of [[Universal suffrage|universal male suffrage]] in France in 1848 was an important milestone in the history of democracy.]]
In 1789, [[Revolutionary France]] adopted the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] and, although short-lived, the [[National Convention]] was elected by all males in 1792.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mars.wnec.edu/~grempel/courses/wc2/lectures/rev892.html |title=The French Revolution II |publisher=Mars.wnec.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Universal suffrage|Universal male suffrage]] was definitely established in [[France]] in March 1848 in the wake of the [[French Revolution of 1848]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Fr icon}} {{cite web |url=http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/histoire/suffrage_universel/suffrage-1848.asp|title=1848 &quot; Désormais le bulletin de vote doit remplacer le fusil &quot;|author=French National Assembly|accessdate=2009-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1848, several [[Revolutions of 1848|revolutions broke out in Europe]] as rulers were confronted with popular demands for liberal constitutions and more democratic government.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.iun.edu/~hisdcl/h114_2002/democracy.htm Movement toward greater democracy in Europe]&quot;. Indiana University Northwest.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Australian colonies became democratic during the mid-19th century, with [[South Australia]] being the first government in the world to introduce women's suffrage in 1861.  (It was argued that as women would vote the same as their husbands, this essentially gave married men two votes, which was not unreasonable.)

[[New Zealand]] granted suffrage to (native) [[Māori people|Māori]] men in 1867, white men in 1879, and women in 1893, thus becoming the first major nation to achieve [[universal suffrage]]. However, women were not eligible to stand for parliament until 1919.

Liberal democracies were few and often short-lived before the late 19th century, and various nations and territories have also claimed to be the first with [[universal suffrage]].

===20th and 21st centuries===
20th century transitions to liberal democracy have come in successive &quot;waves of democracy,&quot; variously resulting from wars, revolutions, [[decolonization]], [http://www.prc.utexas.edu/prec/en/publications/articles/index.html religious and economic circumstances]. [[World War I]] and the dissolution of the [[Ottoman empire|Ottoman]] and [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] empires resulted in the creation of new nation-states from Europe, most of them at least nominally democratic.

In the 1920s democracy flourished, but the [[Great Depression]] brought disenchantment, and most of the countries of Europe, Latin America, and Asia turned to strong-man rule or dictatorships. [[Fascism]] and dictatorships flourished in [[Nazi Germany]], [[Italy]], [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]], as well as nondemocratic regimes in the [[Baltics]], the [[Balkans]], [[Brazil]], [[Cuba]], [[China]], and [[Japan]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://72.14.205.104/search?q=cache:jCe2MTKLhzAJ:www.snl.depaul.edu/contents/current/syllabi/HC_314.doc+Stalin+1930%27s+%22Age+of+Dictators%22&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=1&amp;lr=lang_en Age of Dictators: Totalitarianism in the inter-war period]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[World War II]] brought a definitive reversal of this trend in western Europe. The successful democratization of the [[Allied Control Council|American, British, and French sectors of occupied Germany]] (disputed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.org/publications/tir/article.asp?a=599 |title=Did the United States Create Democracy in Germany?: The Independent Review: The Independent Institute |publisher=Independent.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;), Austria, Italy, and the [[occupied Japan]] served as a model for the later theory of [[regime change]].

However, most of [[Eastern Europe]], including the [[German Democratic Republic|Soviet sector of Germany]] was forced into the non-democratic [[Soviet bloc]]. The war was followed by [[decolonization]], and again most of the new independent states had nominally democratic constitutions. [[India]] emerged as the world's largest democracy and continues to be so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/country_profiles/1154019.stm |title=World &amp;#124; South Asia &amp;#124; Country profiles &amp;#124; Country profile: India |publisher=BBC News |date=2010-06-07 |accessdate=2010-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1960, the vast majority of country-states were nominally democracies, although the majority of the world's populations lived in nations that experienced sham elections, and other forms of subterfuge (particularly in Communist nations and the former colonies.)

[[Image:Freedom in the world.svg|thumb|350px|This graph shows [[Freedom House]]'s evaluation of the number of nations in the different categories given above for the period for which there are surveys, 1972–2005]]
A subsequent wave of [[democratization]] brought substantial gains toward true liberal democracy for many nations. [[Spanish democratic transition|Spain]], [[Portuguese transition to democracy|Portugal]] (1974), and several of the military dictatorships in South America returned to civilian rule in the late 1970s and early 1980s ([[Argentine transition to democracy|Argentina in 1983]], [[History of Bolivia|Bolivia]], [[History of Uruguay|Uruguay in 1984]], [[History of Brazil (1985–present)|Brazil in 1985]], and [[Chilean transition to democracy|Chile in the early 1990s]]). This was followed by nations in [[East Asia|East]] and [[South Asia]] by the mid-to-late 1980s.

Economic malaise in the 1980s, along with resentment of communist oppression, contributed to the [[History of the Soviet Union (1985-1991)|collapse of the Soviet Union]], the associated end of the [[Cold War]], and the democratization and [[liberalization]] of the former [[Eastern bloc]] countries. The most successful of the new democracies were those geographically and culturally closest to western Europe, and they are now members or candidate members of the [[European Union]]{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} &lt;!-- should include more details explaining difficulties of some of former Eastern Bloc countries, and why some transitions were more successful in some of these countries than others --&gt;. Some researchers consider that in contemporary Russia there is no real democracy and one of forms of dictatorship takes place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zagraevsky.com/democracy_engl.htm |title=Dr. Sergey Zagraevsky.

[[Image:Democracy Index 2010.png|thumb|right|350px|'' The [[Economist Intelligence Unit]]'''s [[Democracy Index]] as published in December 2010. The palest blue countries get a score above 9 out of 10 (with [[Norway]] being the most democratic country at 9.80), while the black countries score below 3 (with [[North Korea]] being the least democratic at 1.08).]]

The liberal trend spread to some nations in Africa in the 1990s, most prominently in South Africa. Some recent examples of attempts of liberalization include the [[Indonesian Revolution of 1998]], the [[5th October Overthrow|Bulldozer Revolution]] in [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], the [[Rose Revolution]] in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], the [[Orange Revolution]] in [[Ukraine]], the [[Cedar Revolution]] in [[Lebanon]], the [[Tulip Revolution]] in [[Kyrgyzstan]], and the [[2010–2011 Tunisian revolution|Jasmine Revolution]] in [[Tunisia]].

According to [[Freedom House]], in 2007 there were 123 electoral democracies (up from 40 in 1972).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freedomhouse.org/template.cfm?page=368&amp;year=2007 |title=Tables and Charts |publisher=Freedomhouse.org |date=2004-05-10 |accessdate=2010-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[World Forum on Democracy]], electoral democracies now represent 120 of the 192 existing countries and constitute 58.2 percent of the world's population. At the same time liberal democracies i.e. countries Freedom House regards as free and respectful of basic human rights and the rule of law are 85 in number and represent 38 percent of the global population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fordemocracy.net/electoral.shtml# List of Electoral Democracies]&lt;/ref&gt;

As such, it has been speculated that this trend may continue in the future to the point where liberal democratic nation-states become the universal standard form of human [[society]]. This prediction forms the core of [[Francis Fukayama]]'s &quot;[[The End of History and the Last Man|End of History]]&quot; controversial theory. These theories are criticized by those who fear an evolution of liberal democracies to [[post-democracy]], and others who point out the high number of [[illiberal democracies]].

==Forms==
{{Main|Varieties of democracy|List of types of democracy}}

Democracy has taken a number of forms, both in theory and practice. The following kinds are not exclusive of one another: many specify details of aspects that are independent of one another and can co-exist in a single system.

[[File:2009 Freedom House world map.svg|thumb|350px|Political ratings of countries according to [[Freedom House]]’s [http://freedomhouse.org/template.cfm?page=463 Freedom in the World] survey, 2009:{{legend|#179C86|Free}}{{legend|#F6DD4F|Partly Free}}{{legend|#706EA4|Not Free}}]]

[[File:Electoral democracies.png|thumb|350px|Countries highlighted in &lt;span style=&quot;color: navy&quot;&gt;'''blue'''&lt;/span&gt; are designated &quot;electoral democracies&quot; in [[Freedom House]]'s 2010 survey [http://www.freedomhouse.org/uploads/fiw10/FIW_2010_Tables_and_Graphs.pdf Freedom in the World] ]]

===Representative===
{{Main|Representative democracy}}
[[Representative democracy]] involves the selection of government officials by the people being represented. If the head of state is also [[Democratically-elected government|democratically elected]] then it is called a democratic [[republic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wsu.edu/~dee/REV/RADICAL.HTM |title=Radical Revolution - The Thermidorean Reaction |publisher=Wsu.edu |date=1999-06-06 |accessdate=2010-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common mechanisms involve election of the candidate with a majority or a [[Plurality (voting)|plurality]] of the votes.

Representatives may be elected or become diplomatic representatives by a particular district (or [[constituency]]), or represent the entire electorate proportionally [[Proportional representation|proportional]] systems, with some using a combination of the two. Some representative democracies also incorporate elements of direct democracy, such as [[referendum]]s. A characteristic of representative democracy is that while the representatives are elected by the people to act in their interest, they retain the freedom to exercise their own judgment as how best to do so.

====Parliamentary====
{{Main|Parliamentary system}}
[[Parliamentary democracy]] is a representative democracy where government is appointed by parliamentary representatives as opposed to a 'presidential rule' wherein the President is both head of state and the head of government and is elected by the voters. Under a parliamentary democracy, government is exercised by delegation to an executive ministry and subject to ongoing review, checks and balances by the legislative parliament elected by the people.&lt;ref&gt;Keen, Benjamin, A History of Latin America.

====Liberal====
A [[Liberal democracy]] is a representative democracy in which the ability of the elected representatives to exercise decision-making power is subject to the [[rule of law]], and usually moderated by a constitution that emphasizes the protection of the rights and freedoms of individuals, and which places constraints on the leaders and on the extent to which the will of the majority can be exercised against the rights of minorities (see civil liberties). In a liberal democracy, it is possible for some large-scale decisions to [[Emergent democracy | emerge]] from the many individual decisions that citizens are free to make. In other words, citizens can &quot;vote with their feet&quot; or &quot;vote with their dollars&quot;, resulting in significant informal government-by-the-masses that exercises many &quot;powers&quot; associated with formal government elsewhere.

===Constitutional===
::''See: [[Constitutional democracy]]''

===Direct===
{{Main|Direct democracy}}
[[Direct democracy]] is a political system where the citizens participate in the decision-making personally, contrary to relying on intermediaries or representatives. The supporters of direct democracy argue that democracy is more than merely a procedural issue. A direct democracy gives the voting population the power to:

# Change constitutional laws,
# Put forth initiatives, referendums and suggestions for laws,
# Give binding orders to elective officials, such as revoking them before the end of their elected term, or initiating a lawsuit for breaking a campaign promise.

Of the three measures mentioned, most operate in developed democracies today. This is part of a gradual shift towards direct democracies. Examples of this include the extensive use of [[referendum]]s in [[California]] with more than 20 million voters, and (i.e., voting).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themercury.co.za/index.php?fArticleId=3985561 |title=Article on direct democracy by Imraan Buccus |publisher=Themercury.co.za |date= |accessdate=2010-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Switzerland]], where five million voters decide on national referendums and [[initiative]]s two to four times a year; direct democratic instruments are also well established at the cantonal and communal level. [[Vermont]] towns have been known for their yearly town meetings, held every March to decide on local issues. No direct democracy is in existence outside the framework of a different overarching form of government. Most direct democracies to date have been weak forms, relatively small communities, usually [[city-state]]s. The world is yet to see a large, fundamental, working example of direct democracy as of yet, with most examples being small and weak forms.

::''See: [[List of direct democracy parties]]''

===Inclusive democracy===
{{Main|Inclusive Democracy}}
[[Inclusive democracy]] is a political theory and political project that aims for [[direct democracy]] in all fields of social life: political democracy in the form of face-to-face assemblies which are confederated, [[economic democracy]] in a [[Stateless society|stateless]], moneyless and marketless economy, democracy in the social realm, i.e.[[self-management]] in places of work and education, and ecological democracy which aims to reintegrate society and nature. The theoretical project of inclusive democracy emerged from the work of political philosopher [[Takis Fotopoulos]] in &quot;Towards An Inclusive Democracy&quot; and was further developed in the journal ''[[Democracy &amp; Nature]]' and its successor ''The International Journal of Inclusive Democracy''.

The basic unit of decision making in an inclusive democracy is the demotic assembly, i.e. the assembly of demos, the citizen body in a given geographical area which may encompass a town and the surrounding villages, or even neighbourhoods of large cities. An inclusive democracy today can only take the form of a confederal democracy that is based on a network of administrative councils whose members or delegates are elected from popular face-to-face democratic assemblies in the various demoi. Thus, their role is purely administrative and practical, not one of policy-making like that of representatives in representative democracy.The citizen body is advised by experts but it is the citizen body which functions as the ultimate decision-taker . Authority can be delegated to a segment of the citizen body to carry out specific duties, for example to serve as members of popular courts, or of regional and confederal councils. Such delegation is made, in principle, by lot, on a rotation basis, and is always recallable by the citizen body. Delegates to regional and confederal bodies should have specific mandates.

===Participatory===
{{Main|Participatory politics}}
A [[Parpolity]] or Participatory Polity is a theoretical form of democracy that is ruled by a [[Parpolity#|Nested Council]] structure. The guiding philosophy is that people should have decision making power in proportion to how much they are affected by the decision. Local councils of 25–50 people are completely autonomous on issues that affect only them, and these councils send delegates to higher level councils who are again autonomous regarding issues that affect only the population affected by that council.

A council court of randomly chosen citizens serves as a check on the tyranny of the majority, and rules on which body gets to vote on which issue. Delegates can vote differently than their sending council might wish, but are mandated to communicate the wishes of their sending council. Delegates are recallable at any time. Referendums are possible at any time via votes of the majority of lower level councils, however, not everything is a referendum as this is most likely a waste of time. A parpolity is meant to work in tandem with a [[participatory economy]].

===Socialist===
{{quote|&quot;Democracy cannot consist solely of elections that are nearly always fictitious and managed by rich landowners and professional politicians.&quot;| [[Che Guevara]], Marxist revolutionary&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/guevara/1961/08/08.htm &quot;Economics Cannot be Separated from Politics&quot;] speech by Che Guevara to the ministerial meeting of the Inter-American Economic and Social Council (CIES), in Punta del Este, Uruguay on August 8, 1961&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Socialism|Socialist]] thought has several different views on democracy. [[Social democracy]], [[democratic socialism]], and the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] (usually exercised through [[Soviet democracy]]) are some examples. Many democratic socialists and social democrats believe in a form of [[participatory democracy]] and [[workplace democracy]] combined with a [[representative democracy]].

Within [[Democracy in Marxist theory|Marxist orthodoxy]] there is a hostility to what is commonly called &quot;liberal democracy&quot;, which they simply refer to as parliamentary democracy because of its often centralized nature. Because of their desire to eliminate the political elitism they see in capitalism, [[Marxism|Marxists]], [[Leninism|Leninists]] and [[Trotskyism|Trotskyists]] believe in [[direct democracy]] implemented though a system of [[commune (Socialism)|communes]] (which are sometimes called [[Soviet (council)|soviets]]). This system ultimately manifests itself as council democracy and begins with workplace democracy. (See [[Democracy in Marxism]])

===Anarchist===
Anarchists are split in this domain, depending on whether they believe that a majority-rule is tyrannic or not.
The only form of democracy considered acceptable to many [[Anarchism|anarchists]] is [[direct democracy]]. [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] argued that the only acceptable form of direct democracy is one in which it is recognized that majority decisions are not binding on the minority, even when unanimous.&lt;ref&gt;Pierre-Joseph Proudhon. ''General Idea of the Revolution'' See also commentary by [[Robert Graham (historian)|Graham, Robert]]. [http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/ANARCHIST_ARCHIVES/proudhon/grahamproudhon.html ''The General Idea of Proudhon's Revolution'']&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[anarcho-communist]] [[Murray Bookchin]] criticized [[individualist anarchists]] for opposing democracy,&lt;ref&gt;Bookchin, Murray. Communalism: The Democratic Dimensions of Social Anarchism. Anarchism, Marxism and the Future of the Left: Interviews and Essays, 1993–1998, AK Press 1999, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; and says &quot;majority rule&quot; is consistent with anarchism.&lt;ref&gt;Bookchin, Murray. [http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/anarchist_archives/bookchin/soclife.html Social Anarchism or Lifestyle Anarchism: An Unbridgeable Chasm]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some anarcho-communists oppose the majoritarian nature of direct democracy, feeling that it can impede individual liberty and opt in favour of a non-majoritarian form of [[consensus democracy]], similar to Proudhon's position on direct democracy.&lt;ref&gt;Graeber, David and Grubacic, Andrej. ''Anarchism, Or The Revolutionary Movement Of The Twenty-first Century''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henry David Thoreau]], who did not self-identify as an anarchist but argued for &quot;a better government&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;disobedience&quot;&gt;Thoreau, H. D. ''[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/71/71.txt On the Duty of Civil Disobedience]''&lt;/ref&gt; and is cited as an inspiration by some anarchists, argued that people should not be in the position of ruling others or being ruled when there is no consent.

===Iroquois===
[[Iroquois]] society had a form of participatory democracy and representative democracy.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;''Iroquois Contributions to Modern Democracy and Communism.'' Bagley, Carol L.; Ruckman, Jo Ann. American Indian Culture and Research Journal, v7 n2 p53-72 1983&lt;/ref&gt;  Elizabeth Tooker, a [[Temple University]] professor of anthropology and an authority on the culture and history of the Northern Iroquois, has reviewed the claim that the Iroquois inspired the American Confederation and concluded they are myth rather than fact.  The relationship between the Iroquois League and the Constitution is based on a portion of a letter written by [[Benjamin Franklin]] and a speech by the Iroquois chief [[Canasatego]] in 1744.  Tooker concluded that the documents only indicate that some groups of Iroquois and white settlers realized the advantages of uniting against a common enemy, and that ultimately there is little evidence to support the idea that 18th century colonists were knowledgeable regarding the Iroquois system of governance.  What little evidence there is regarding this system indicates chiefs of different tribes were permitted representation in the Iroquois League council, and this ability to represent the tribe was hereditary.  The council itself did not practice representative government, and there were no elections; deceased chiefs' successors were selected by the most senior woman within the hereditary lineage, in consultation with other women in the clan.  Decision making occurred through lengthy discussion and decisions were unanimous, with topics discussed being introduced by a single tribe.  Tooker concludes that &quot;...there is virtually no evidence that the framers [of the Constitution] borrowed from the Iroquois&quot; and that the myth that this was the case is the result of exaggerations and misunderstandings of a claim made by Iroquois linguist and ethnographer [[John Napoleon Brinton Hewitt|J.N.B. Hewitt]] after his death in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=Clifton JA |title=The Invented Indian: cultural fictions and government policies |publisher=Transaction Publishers |location=New Brunswick, N.J., U.S.A |year=1990 |pages= [http://books.google.com/books?id=PVSY2wFW-yoC&amp;pg=PA107#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 107–128] | chapter = The United States Constitution and the Iroquois League |isbn=1-56000-745-1 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate= | author = Tooker E}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sortition===
{{Main|Sortition}}
Sometimes called &quot;democracy without elections&quot;, [[sortition]] is the process of choosing decision makers via a random process. The intention is that those chosen will be representative of the opinions and interests of the people at large, and be more fair and impartial than an elected official. The technique was in widespread use in [[Athenian Democracy]] and is still used in modern [[jury selection]].

===Consensus===
{{Main|Consensus democracy}}
[[Consensus democracy]] requires varying degrees of consensus rather than just a mere democratic majority. It typically attempts to protect minority rights from domination by majority rule.

===Supranational===
[[Qualified majority voting]] (QMV) is designed by the [[Treaty of Rome]] to be the principal method of reaching decisions in the [[European Council of Ministers]]. This system allocates votes to member states in part according to their population, but heavily weighted in favour of the smaller states. This might be seen as a form of representative democracy, but representatives to the Council might be appointed rather than directly elected.

Some might consider the &quot;individuals&quot; being democratically represented to be states rather than people, as with many other [[international organization]]s. [[European Parliament]] members are democratically directly elected on the basis of universal suffrage, may be seen as an example of a [[supranational]] democratic institution.

===Cosmopolitan===
{{Main|Cosmopolitan democracy}}
{{quote|Democracy is not only a political system… It is an ideal, an aspiration, really, intimately connected to and dependent upon a picture of what it is to be human—of what it is a human should be to be fully human.| [[Nikolas Kompridis]]&lt;ref&gt;Nikolas Kompridis, &quot;[http://www.parrhesiajournal.org/parrhesia08/parrhesia08_kompridis.pdf Technology's Challenge to Democracy,&quot; ''Parrhesia'' 8 (2009)], 31.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Cosmopolitan democracy]], also known as [[Global democracy]] or [[World Federalism]], is a political system in which democracy is implemented on a global scale, either directly or through representatives. An important justification for this kind of system is that the decisions made in national or regional democracies often affect people outside the constituency who, by definition, cannot vote. By contrast, in a cosmopolitan democracy, the people who are affected by decisions also have a say in them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.danielearchibugi.org/downloads/papers/CD_and_critics_A_review.pdf |title=Article on Cosmopolitan democracy by Daniele Archibugi |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;According to its supporters, any attempt to solve global problems is undemocratic without some form of cosmopolitan democracy. The general principle of cosmopolitan democracy is to expand some or all of the values and norms of democracy, including the rule of law; the non-violent resolution of conflicts; and equality among citizens, beyond the limits of the state. To be fully implemented, this would require reforming existing [[international organizations]], e.g. the [[United Nations]], as well as the creation of new institutions such as a [[World Parliament]], which ideally would enhance public control over, and accountability in, international politics.

Cosmopolitan Democracy has been promoted, among others, by physicist Albert Einstein,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/~ah297/un-esa/ws1997-letter-einstein.html |title=letter by Einstein – &quot;To the General Assembly of the United Nations&quot; |publisher=Columbia.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; writer Kurt Vonnegut, columnist George Monbiot, and professors [[David Held]] and [[Daniele Archibugi]].&lt;ref&gt;Daniele Archibugi &amp; David Held, eds., ''Cosmopolitan Democracy. An Agenda for a New World Order'', Polity Press, Cambridge, 1995; David Held, ''Democracy and the Global Order'', Polity Press, Cambridge, 1995, Daniele Archibugi, [http://press.princeton.edu/titles/8737.html ''The Global Commonwealth of Citizens. Toward Cosmopolitan Democracy''], Princeton University Press, Princeton, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The creation of the [[International Criminal Court]] in 2003 was seen as a major step forward by many supporters of this type of cosmopolitan democracy.

===Non-governmental===
Aside from the public sphere, similar democratic principles and mechanisms of voting and representation have been used to govern other kinds of communities and organizations.
*Many [[non-governmental organizations]] decide policy and leadership by voting.
*Most [[trade union]]s choose their leadership through democratic elections.
*[[Cooperatives]] are enterprises owned and democratically controlled by their customers or workers.

==Theory==
===Aristotle===
[[File:Aristotle Altemps Inv8575.jpg|thumb|right|A marble sculpture of [[Aristotle]].]]
[[Aristotle]] contrasted rule by the many (democracy/[[polity]]), with rule by the few ([[oligarchy]]/[[aristocracy]]), and with rule by a single person ([[tyranny]] or today [[autocracy]]/[[monarchy]]). He also thought that there was a good and a bad variant of each system (he considered democracy to be the degenerate counterpart to polity).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humanities.mq.edu.au/Ockham/y6704.html |title=Aristotle, The Politics |publisher=Humanities.mq.edu.au |date= |accessdate=2010-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/a/aristotl.htm Aristotle (384–322 BC): General Introduction] [[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]&lt;/ref&gt;

For Aristotle the underlying principle of democracy is freedom, since only in a democracy the citizens can have a share in freedom. In essence, he argues that this is what every democracy should make its aim. There are two main aspects of freedom: being ruled and ruling in turn, since everyone is equal according to number, not merit, and to be able to live as one pleases.

{{quote|Now a fundamental principle of the democratic form of constitution is liberty—that is what is usually asserted, implying that only under this constitution do men participate in liberty, for they assert this as the aim of every democracy. But one factor of liberty is to govern and be governed in turn; for the popular principle of justice is to have equality according to number, not worth, and if this is the principle of justice prevailing, the multitude must of necessity be sovereign and the decision of the majority must be final and must constitute justice, for they say that each of the citizens ought to have an equal share; so that it results that in democracies the poor are more powerful than the rich, because there are more of them and whatever is decided by the majority is sovereign. This then is one mark of liberty which all democrats set down as a principle of the constitution. And one is for a man to live as he likes; for they say that this is the function of liberty, inasmuch as to live not as one likes is the life of a man that is a slave. This is the second principle of democracy, and from it has come the claim not to be governed, preferably not by anybody, or failing that, to govern and be governed in turns; and this is the way in which the second principle contributes to equalitarian liberty.&lt;ref name=&quot;AristotlePol1317b&quot;/&gt;}}

===Conceptions===
Among political theorists, there are many contending conceptions of democracy.
*''Aggregative democracy'' uses democratic processes to solicit citizens’ preferences and then aggregate them together to determine what social policies society should adopt. Therefore, proponents of this view hold that democratic participation should primarily focus on [[voting]], where the policy with the most votes gets implemented. There are different variants of this:
**Under ''minimalism'', democracy is a system of government in which citizens give teams of political leaders the right to rule in periodic elections. According to this minimalist conception, citizens cannot and should not “rule” because, for example, on most issues, most of the time, they have no clear views or their views are not well-founded. [[Joseph Schumpeter]] articulated this view most famously in his book ''Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Schumpeter]], (1950). ''Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy''. Harper Perennial. ISBN 0-06-133008-6.&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary proponents of minimalism include [[William H. Riker]], [[Adam Przeworski]], [[Richard Posner]].
**[[Direct democracy]], on the other hand, holds that citizens should participate directly, not through their representatives, in making laws and policies. Proponents of direct democracy offer varied reasons to support this view. Political activity can be valuable in itself, it socializes and educates citizens, and popular participation can check powerful elites. Most importantly, citizens do not really rule themselves unless they directly decide laws and policies.
**Governments will tend to produce laws and policies that are close to the views of the median voter{{ndash}} with half to his left and the other half to his right. This is not actually a desirable outcome as it represents the action of self-interested and somewhat unaccountable political elites competing for votes. Downs suggests that ideological political parties are necessary to act as a mediating broker between individual and governments. [[Anthony Downs]] laid out this view in his 1957 book ''An Economic Theory of Democracy''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Anthony Downs]], (1957). ''An Economic Theory of Democracy''. Harpercollins College. ISBN 0-06-041750-1.&lt;/ref&gt;
**[[Robert A. Dahl]] argues that the fundamental democratic principle is that, when it comes to binding collective decisions, each person in a political community is entitled to have his/her interests be given equal consideration (not necessarily that all people are equally satisfied by the collective decision). He uses the term [[polyarchy]] to refer to societies in which there exists a certain set of institutions and procedures which are perceived as leading to such democracy. First and foremost among these institutions is the regular occurrence of free and open [[elections]] which are used to select representatives who then manage all or most of the public policy of the society. However, these polyarchic procedures may not create a full democracy if, for example, poverty prevents political participation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert A. Dahl|Dahl, Robert]], (1989). ''Democracy and its Critics.'' New Haven: Yale University Press. ISBN 0300049382&lt;/ref&gt; Some{{Who|date=November 2009}} see a problem with the wealthy having more influence and therefore argue for reforms like [[campaign finance reform]]. Some{{Who|date=November 2009}} may see it as a problem that the majority of the voters decide policy, as opposed to majority rule of the entire population. This can be used as an argument for making political participation mandatory, like compulsory [[voting]] &lt;!-- hiding, need info about publisher of this article, please fix&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apsanet.org/imgtest/verba.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt; or for making it more patient (non-compulsory) by simply refusing power to the government until the full majority feels inclined to speak their minds.
*''[[Deliberative democracy]]'' is based on the notion that democracy is government by discussion. Deliberative democrats contend that laws and policies should be based upon reasons that all citizens can accept. The political arena should be one in which leaders and citizens make arguments, listen, and change their minds.
*''[[Radical democracy]]'' is based on the idea that there are hierarchical and oppressive power relations that exist in society. Democracy's role is to make visible and challenge those relations by allowing for difference, dissent and antagonisms in decision making processes.

===Republic===
{{Main|Republicanism}}
In contemporary usage, the term ''democracy'' refers to a government chosen by the people, whether it is direct or representative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/democracy |title=Democracy – Definition from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary |publisher=M-w.com |date=2007-04-25 |accessdate=2010-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''[[republic]]'' has many different meanings, but today often refers to a representative democracy with an elected [[head of state]], such as a [[president]], serving for a limited term, in contrast to states with a hereditary [[monarch]] as a head of state, even if these states also are representative democracies with an elected or appointed [[head of government]] such as a [[Prime Minister|prime minister]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/republic |title=Republic – Definition from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary |publisher=M-w.com |date=2007-04-25 |accessdate=2010-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Founding Fathers of the United States]] rarely praised and often criticized democracy, which in their time tended to specifically mean [[direct democracy]]; [[James Madison]] argued, especially in [[Federalist No. 10|''The Federalist'' No. 10]], that what distinguished a ''democracy'' from a ''republic'' was that the former became weaker as it got larger and suffered more violently from the effects of faction, whereas a republic could get stronger as it got larger and combats faction by its very structure.

What was critical to American values, [[John Adams]] insisted,&lt;ref&gt;Novanglus, no. 7, 6 Mar. 1775&lt;/ref&gt; was that the government be &quot;bound by fixed laws, which the people have a voice in making, and a right to defend.&quot; As Benjamin Franklin was exiting after writing the U.S. constitution, a woman asked him &quot;Well, Doctor, what have we got—a republic or a monarchy?&quot;. He replied &quot;A republic—if you can keep it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/v1ch18I.html |title='&amp;#39;The Founders' Constitution: Volume 1, Chapter 18, Introduction'&amp;#39;, &quot;Epilogue: Securing the Republic&quot; |publisher=Press-pubs.uchicago.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Constitutional monarchs and upper chambers===
Initially after the American and French revolutions the question was open whether a democracy, in order to restrain unchecked majority rule, should have an elitist [[upper chamber]], the members perhaps appointed meritorious experts or having lifetime tenures, or should have a [[constitutional monarch]] with limited but real powers. Some countries (as Britain, the Netherlands, Belgium, Scandinavian countries, Thailand, Japan and Bhutan) turned powerful monarchs into constitutional monarchs with limited or, often gradually, merely symbolic roles.

Often the monarchy was abolished along with the aristocratic system (as in France, China, Russia, Germany, Austria, Hungary, Italy, Greece and Egypt). Many nations had elite upper houses of legislatures which often had lifetime tenure, but eventually these lost power (as in Britain) or else became elective and remained powerful (as in the United States).

==Development of democracy==
Several philosophers and researchers outlined historical and social factors supporting the evolution of democracy.
''Cultural factors'' like ''Protestantism'' influenced the development of democracy, rule of law, human rights and political liberty (the faithful elected priests, religious freedom and tolerance has been practiced).

Others mentioned the influence of ''wealth'' (e.g. S. M. Lipset, 1959). In a related theory, [[Ronald Inglehart]] suggests that the increase in living standards has convinced people that they can take their basic survival for granted, and led to increased emphasis on [[self-expression values]], which is highly correlated to democracy.&lt;ref&gt;Inglehart, Ronald. Welzel, Christian ''Modernization, Cultural Change and Democracy: The Human Development Sequence'', 2005. Cambridge: [[Cambridge University Press]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently established theories stress the relevance of ''education'' and ''human capital'' and within them of ''cognitive ability''. They increase tolerance, rationality, political literacy and participation. Two effects of education and cognitive ability are distinguished: a cognitive effect (competence to make rational choices, better information processing) and an ethical effect (support of democratic values, freedom, human rights etc.), which itself depends on intelligence (cognitive development being a prerequisite for moral development; Glaeser et al., 2007; Deary et al., 2008; Rindermann, 2008).
&lt;ref&gt;Glaeser, E., Ponzetto, G. &amp; Shleifer, A. (2007). Why does democracy need education? Journal of Economic Growth, 12(2), 77–99. Deary, I. J., Batty, G. D. &amp; Gale, C. R. (2008). Bright children become enlightened adults. Psychological Science, 19(1), 1–6. Rindermann, H. (2008). Relevance of education and intelligence for the political development of nations: Democracy, rule of law and political liberty. Intelligence, 36(4), 306–322.&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence that is consistent with conventional theories of why democracy emerges and is sustained has been hard to come by. Recent statistical analyses have challenged modernization theory by demonstrating that there is no reliable evidence for the claim that democracy is more likely to emerge when countries become wealthier, more educated, or less unequal (Albertus and Menaldo, Forthcoming).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1618909 |title=Albertus, Michael and Victor Menaldo. Forthcoming. &quot;Coercive Capacity and the Prospects for Democratization&quot; Comparative Politics}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither is there convincing evidence that increased reliance on oil revenues prevents democratization, despite a vast theoretical literature called &quot;The Resource Curse&quot; that asserts that oil revenues sever the link between citizen taxation and government accountability, the key to representative democracy (Haber and Menaldo, Forthcoming).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plawlotic.com/?p=8 |title=The Resource Curse: Does the Emperor Have no Clothes?}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of evidence for these conventional theories of democratization have led researchers to search for the &quot;deep&quot; determinants of contemporary political institutions, be they geographical or demographic (Engerman and Sokoloff 1997; Acemoglu and Robinson 2008; Haber and Menaldo 2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plawlotic.com/?p=102 |title=Rainfall and Democracy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facts==
In practice it may not pay the incumbents to conduct fair elections in countries that have no history of democracy. A study showed that incumbents who rig elections stay in office 2.5 times as long as those who permit fair elections.&lt;ref name=&quot;wp091108&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/11/06/AR2009110601906.html |title=5 myths about the beauty of the ballot box |accessdate= |author=Paul Collier |authorlink=Paul Collier |coauthors= |date=2009-11-08 |year= |month= |work= Washington Post |publisher=Washington Post |pages=B2 |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Above $2,700 per capita democracies have been found to be less prone to violence, but below that threshold, more violence.&lt;ref name=&quot;wp091108&quot;/&gt; The same study shows that election misconduct is more likely in countries with low per capita incomes, small populations, rich in natural resources, and a lack of institutional checks and balances. Sub-Saharan countries, as well as Afghanistan, all tend to fall into that category.&lt;ref name=&quot;wp091108&quot;/&gt;

Governments that have frequent elections averaged over the political cycle &lt;!---no. I don't know what that means---&gt; have significantly better economic policies than those who don't. This does not apply to governments with fraudulent elections, however.&lt;ref name=&quot;wp091108&quot;/&gt;

==Opposition to democracy==
{{Main|Opposition to democracy}}
Democracy in modern times has almost always faced opposition from the existing government. The implementation of a democratic government within a non-democratic state is typically brought about by [[democratic revolution]]. [[Monarchy]] had traditionally been opposed to democracy, and to this day remains opposed to [[abolition of monarchy|its abolition]], although often political [[compromise]] has been reached in the form of [[shared government]].

Currently, opposition to democracy exists most notably in [[communist state]]s, and absolute [[monarchy|monarchies]] which appear to have various reasons for opposing the implementation of democracy or democratic reforms.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

==Criticism of democracy==
{{Main|Criticism of democracy}}
Economists since [[Milton Friedman]] have strongly criticized the efficiency of democracy. They base this on their premise of the irrational voter. Their argument is that voters are highly uninformed about many political issues, especially relating to economics, and have a strong bias about the few issues on which they are fairly knowledgeable.

===Mob rule===
[[Plato]]'s ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'' presents a critical view of democracy through the narration of [[Socrates]]: &quot;Democracy, which is a charming form of government, full of variety and disorder, and dispensing a sort of equality to equals and unequaled alike.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''the Republic of Plato'' (London: J.M Dent &amp; Sons LTD.; New York: E.P. Dutton &amp; Co. Inc.), 558-C.&lt;/ref&gt; In his work, Plato lists 5 forms of government from best to worst. Assuming that ''the Republic'' was intended to be a serious critique of the political thought in Athens, Plato argues that only [[Kallipolis]], an aristocracy led by the unwilling philosopher-kings (the wisest men) is a just form of government.

===Political instability===
More recently, democracy is criticised for not offering enough political stability. As governments are frequently elected on and off there tends to be frequent changes in the policies of democratic countries both domestically and internationally. Even if a political party maintains power, vociferous, headline grabbing protests and harsh criticism from the mass media are often enough to force sudden, unexpected political change. Frequent policy changes with regard to business and immigration are likely to deter investment and so hinder economic growth. For this reason, many people have put forward the idea that democracy is undesirable for a developing country in which economic growth and the reduction of poverty are top priority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/7671283.stm | work=BBC News | title=Head to head: African democracy | date=2008-10-16 | accessdate=2010-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This opportunist alliance not only has the handicap of having to cater to too many ideologically opposing factions, but it is usually short lived since any perceived or actual imbalance in the treatment of coalition partners, or changes to leadership in the coalition partners themselves, can very easily result in the coalition partner withdrawing its support from the government.

===Popular rule as a façade===
The 20th Century Italian thinkers [[Vilfredo Pareto]] and [[Gaetano Mosca]] (independently) argued that democracy was illusory, and served only to mask the reality of elite rule. Indeed, they argued that elite oligarchy is the unbendable law of human nature, due largely to the apathy and division of the masses (as opposed to the drive, initiative and unity of the elites), and that democratic institutions would do no more than shift the exercise of power from oppression to manipulation.&lt;ref&gt;Femia, Joseph V. &quot;Against the Masses&quot;, Oxford 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[logic]] and [[mathematics]], a two-place [[logical operator]] '''or''', is a '''logical disjunction''', also known as '''inclusive disjunction''' or '''alternation''', that results in true whenever ''one or more'' of its operands are true. E.g. in this context, &quot;''A'' or ''B''&quot; is true [[if]] ''A'' is true, or if ''B'' is true, or if both ''A'' and ''B'' are true. In [[grammar]], '''or''' is a [[Grammatical conjunction|coordinating conjunction]]. In ordinary language &quot;or&quot; sometimes has the meaning of [[exclusive disjunction]].

== Notation ==

'''Or''' is usually expressed with the prefix operator '''A''', or with an infix operator. In mathematics and logic, the infix operator is usually '''∨'''; in electronics, '''+'''; and in programming languages, '''|''' or '''or'''.  Some programming languages have a related [[control structure]], the [[short-circuit evaluation|short-circuit or]], written '''||''', '''or else''', etc.

== Definition ==

'''Logical disjunction''' is an [[logical operation|operation]] on two [[logical value]]s, typically the values of two [[proposition]]s, that produces a value of ''false'' if and only if both of its operands are false. More generally a disjunction is a logical formula that can have one or more [[literal (mathematical logic)|literal]]s separated only by ORs. A single literal is often considered to be a degenerate disjunction.

'''truth-preserving: yes'''&lt;br&gt;
When all inputs are true, the output is true.

'''falsehood-preserving: yes'''&lt;br&gt;
When all inputs are false, the output is false.


If using [[binary numeral system|binary]] values for true (1) and false (0), then ''logical disjunction'' works exactly like [[multiplication]] [[Modular arithmetic|modulo]] 2.

== Symbol ==
The mathematical symbol for logical disjunction varies in the literature.  In addition to the word &quot;or&quot;, and the formula &quot;A''pq''&quot;, the symbol &quot;&lt;math&gt;\or&lt;/math&gt;&quot;, deriving from the Latin word ''vel'' for &quot;or&quot;, is commonly used for disjunction.  For example: &quot;''A'' &lt;math&gt;\or&lt;/math&gt; ''B''&amp;nbsp;&quot; is read as &quot;''A'' or ''B''&amp;nbsp;&quot;.  Such a disjunction is false if both ''A'' and ''B'' are false.  In all other cases it is true.

All of the following are disjunctions:
: &lt;math&gt;A \or B&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\neg A \or B&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;A \or \neg B \or \neg C \or D \or \neg E.&lt;/math&gt;

The corresponding operation in set theory is the [[union (set theory)|set-theoretic union]].

== Applications in computer science ==
[[File:Or-gate-en.svg|thumb|right|150px|OR [[logic gate]]]]
[[Operator (programming)|Operators]] corresponding to logical disjunction exist in most [[programming language]]s.
=== Bitwise operation ===
Disjunction is often used for bitwise operations. Examples:

* 0 or 0 = 0
* 0 or 1 = 1
* 1 or 0 = 1
* 1 or 1 = 1
* 1010 or 1100 = 1110

The &lt;code&gt;or&lt;/code&gt; operator can be used to set bits in a [[bitfield]] to 1, by &lt;code&gt;or&lt;/code&gt;-ing the field with a constant field with the relevant bits set to 1.

=== Logical operation ===
Many languages distinguish between bitwise and logical disjunction by providing two distinct operators; in languages following C, bitwise disjunction is performed with the single pipe (&lt;code&gt;|&lt;/code&gt;) and logical disjunction with the double pipe (&lt;code&gt;||&lt;/code&gt;) operators.

Logical disjunction is usually [[Short-circuit evaluation|short-circuited]]; that is, if the first (left) operand evaluates to &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; then the second (right) operand is not evaluated.  The logical disjunction operator thus usually constitutes a [[sequence point]].

Although in most languages the type of a logical disjunction expression is boolean and thus can only have the value &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;, in some (such as [[Python programming language|Python]] and [[JavaScript]]) the logical disjunction operator returns one of its operands: the first operand if it evaluates to a true value, and the second operand otherwise.

===Constructive disjunction===
The [[Curry-Howard correspondence]] relates a [[constructivism (mathematics)|constructivist]] form of disjunction to [[tagged union]] types.

== Union ==
The [[union (set theory)|union]] used in [[set theory]] is defined in terms of a logical disjunction: ''x'' ∈ ''A'' ∪ ''B'' if and only if (''x'' ∈ ''A'') ∨ (''x'' ∈ ''B'').  Because of this, logical disjunction satisfies many of the same identities as set-theoretic union, such as associativity, commutativity, distributivity, and [[de Morgan's laws]].

== Notes ==
* [[Boole]], closely following analogy with ordinary mathematics, premised, as a necessary condition to the definition of &quot;x + y&quot;, that x and y were mutually exclusive.  [[William Stanley Jevons|Jevons]], and practically all mathematical logicians after him, advocated, on various grounds, the definition of &quot;logical addition&quot; in a form which does not necessitate mutual exclusiveness.

A '''disjunctive syllogism''', historically known as ''modus tollendo ponens'',&lt;ref&gt;Sanford, David Hawley. 2003. ''If P, Then Q: Conditionals and the Foundations of Reasoning''. London, UK: Routledge: 39&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[classical logic|classically]] [[validity|valid]], simple [[argument form]]:

: A is B or C
: A is not C
: Therefore, A is B

In [[logical operator]] notation:
:&lt;math&gt; P \lor Q, \lnot P \vdash Q &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\vdash&lt;/math&gt; represents the [[logical assertion]].

Roughly speaking, we are told that at least one of two statements is true; then we are told that it is not the former that is true; so we infer that it has to be the latter that is true.  The reason this is called &quot;disjunctive syllogism&quot; is that, first, it is a [[syllogism]]--a three-step [[argument]]--and second, it contains a [[disjunction]], which means simply an  &quot;or&quot; statement.  &quot;Either P or Q&quot; is a disjunction; P and Q are called the statement's ''disjuncts''.

Note that the disjunctive syllogism works whether 'or' is considered 'exclusive' or 'inclusive' disjunction. See below for the definitions of these terms.

Here is an example:
:Either I will choose soup or I will choose salad.
:I will not choose soup.
:Therefore, I will choose salad.

Here is another example:
:It is either red or blue.
:It is not blue.
:Therefore, it is red.

==Inclusive versus exclusive disjunction==

There are two kinds of logical disjunction:

* ''[[logical disjunction|inclusive]]'' means &quot;and/or&quot;  - at least one of them is true, or maybe both.
* ''[[xor|exclusive]]'' (&quot;xor&quot;) means exactly one must be true, but they cannot both be.

The widely used English language concept of ''or'' is often ambiguous between these two meanings, but the difference is pivotal in evaluating disjunctive arguments. 

This argument:
:Either P or Q.
:Not P.
:Therefore, Q.

is valid and indifferent between both meanings. However, only in the ''exclusive'' meaning is the following form valid:

:Either P or Q (exclusive).
:P.
:Therefore, not Q.

With the ''inclusive'' meaning you could draw no conclusion from the first two premises of that argument. See [[affirming a disjunct]].

==Related argument forms==

Unlike [[modus ponendo ponens]] and [[modus ponendo tollens]], with which it should not be confused, disjunctive syllogism is often not made an explicit rule or axiom of [[logical system]]s, as the above arguments can be proven with a (slightly devious) combination of [[reductio ad absurdum]] and [[disjunction elimination]].

''Other forms of syllogism:'' 
*[[hypothetical syllogism]]
*[[categorical syllogism]]

Disjunctive syllogism holds in classical propositional logic and [[intuitionistic logic]], but not in some [[paraconsistent logic]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Mortensen, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mathematics-inconsistent/ Inconsistent Mathematics], ''Stanford encyclopedia of philosophy'', First published Tue Jul 2, 1996; substantive revision Thu Jul 31, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Other uses}}
A '''definition''' is a passage that explains the [[Meaning (linguistic)|meaning]] of a term (a [[word]], [[phrase]] or other set of [[symbol]]s), or a type of thing. The term to be defined is the ''[[wikt:definiendum|definiendum]]''. A term may have many different senses or meanings. For each such specific sense, a ''[[wikt:definiens|definiens]]'' is a cluster of words that defines that term.

A chief difficulty in managing definition is the need to use other terms that are already understood or whose definitions are easily obtainable. The use of the term in a simple example may suffice.  By contrast, a [[dictionary definition]] has additional details, typically including an [[etymology]] showing snapshots of the earlier meanings and the parent language. 

Like other words, the term ''definition'' has subtly different meanings in different contexts. A definition may be ''descriptive'' of the general use meaning, or ''stipulative'' of the speaker's immediate intentional meaning. For example, in formal languages like mathematics, a 'stipulative' definition guides a specific discussion.  A descriptive definition can be shown to be &quot;right&quot; or &quot;wrong&quot; by comparison to general usage, but a stipulative definition can only be disproved by showing a logical contradiction [http://www.sfu.ca/philosophy/swartz/definitions.htm#part5.1].

A ''[[precising definition]]'' extends the descriptive dictionary definition (lexical definition) of a term for a specific purpose by including additional criteria that narrow down the set of things meeting the definition.

[[Charles Stevenson|C.L. Stevenson]] has identified ''[[persuasive definition]]'' as a form of stipulative definition which purports to describe the &quot;true&quot; or &quot;commonly accepted&quot; meaning of a term, while in reality stipulating an altered use, perhaps as an argument for some specific view.

Stevenson has also noted that some definitions are &quot;legal&quot; or &quot;coercive&quot;, whose object is to create or alter rights, duties or crimes.&lt;ref&gt;Stevenson, C.L., ''Ethics and Language'', Connecticut 1944&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intension and extension==
{{Main|Intension|Extension (semantics)}}

An [[intensional definition]], also called a ''coactive'' definition, specifies the [[necessary and sufficient conditions]] for a thing being a member of a specific [[Set (mathematics)|set]]. Any definition that attempts to set out the essence of something, such as that by [[Genus-differentia definition|genus and differentia]], is an intensional definition.

An ''[[extensional definition]]'', also called a ''denotative'' definition, of a concept or term specifies its ''[[extension (semantics)|extension]]''. It is a list naming every [[object (philosophy)|object]] that is a member of a specific [[Set (mathematics)|set]].

So, for example, an intensional definition of '[[Prime Minister]]' might be ''the most senior minister of a cabinet in the executive branch of government in a parliamentary system''. An extensional definition would be a [[Prime minister#Lists of prime ministers|list of all past, present]] ''and future'' [[prime minister]]s.

One important form of the extensional definition is ''[[ostensive definition]]''. This gives the meaning of a term by pointing, in the case of an individual, to the thing itself, or in the case of a class, to examples of the right kind. So you can explain who ''Alice'' (an individual) is by pointing her out to me; or what a ''rabbit'' (a class) is by pointing at several and expecting me to 'catch on'. The process of ostensive definition itself was critically appraised by [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]].&lt;ref&gt;''Philosophical investigations'', Part 1 §27-34&lt;/ref&gt;

An ''[[enumerative definition]]'' of a concept or term is an ''[[extensional definition]]'' that gives an explicit and exhaustive listing of all the [[object (philosophy)|object]]s that fall under the concept or term in question.  Enumerative definitions are only possible for finite sets and only practical for relatively small sets.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

===''Divisio'' and ''partitio''===
''Divisio'' and ''partitio'' are [[Classics|classical]] terms for definitions. A ''partitio'' is simply an intensional definition. A ''divisio'' is not an extensional definition. ''Divisio'' is an exhaustive list of [[subset]]s of a set, in the sense that every member of the &quot;divided&quot; set is a member of one of the subsets. An extreme form of ''divisio'' lists all sets whose only member is a member of the &quot;divided&quot; set. The difference between this and an extensional definition is that extensional definitions list ''members'', and not sets.&lt;ref&gt;Katerina Ierodiakonou, &quot;The Stoic Division of Philosophy&quot;, in ''Phronesis: A Journal for Ancient Philosophy'', Volume 38, Number 1, 1993 , pp. 57-74.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition by genus and differentia==
{{Biological classification}}
{{Main|Genus-differentia definition}}
A new definition can be composed by two parts:
# '''a [[genus]]''' (or family): An existing definition that serves as a portion of the new definition; all definitions with the same genus are considered members of that genus, and a definition can be composed of multiple '''genera''' (more than one genus).
# '''the differentia''': The portion of the new definition that is not provided by the genera.
For example, consider these two definitions:
* ''a [[triangle]]'': A plane figure bounded by 3 straight sides.
* ''a [[quadrilateral]]'': A plane figure bounded by 4 straight sides.
Those definitions can be expressed as a genus and 2 '''differentiae''':
# ''a genus'': A plane figure.
# ''2 differentiae'':
#* ''the differentia for a triangle'': bounded by 3 straight sides.
#* ''the differentia for a quadrilateral'': bounded by 4 straight sides.
Continuing the process of '''differentiation''':
* ''a [[rectangle]]'': a quadrilateral with 4 right angles.
* ''a [[rhombus]]'': a quadrilateral with all 4 sides having the same length.
Importantly, differentiae can include genera. For instance, consider the following:
* ''a [[square (geometry)|square]]'': a rectangle where all 4 sides are the same length.
This definition could be recast as follows:
* ''a square'': a rectangle that is a rhombus.
* ''a square'': a rhombus that is a rectangle.
* ''a square'': a quadrilateral that is both a rectangle ''and'' a rhombus.
* ''a square'': both a rectangle ''and'' a rhombus.
In other words, a genus of a definition provides a means by which to specify an [[is-a]] relationship, and the non-genus portion of the differentia of a definition provides a means by which to specify a [[has-a]] relationship.

When a system of definitions is constructed with genera and differentiae, the definitions can be thought of as nodes forming a [[hierarchy]] or—more generally—a [[directed acyclic graph]]; a node that has no [[Directed graph|predecessors]] is ''a most general definition''; each node along a directed path is ''more '''differentiated''''' (or ''more '''derived''''') than its predecessors, and a node with no [[Directed graph|successors]] is ''a most differentiated'' (or ''a most derived'') ''definition''. When a definition, ''S'', is the [[Directed graph|tail]] of all of its successors (that is, ''S'' has at least one successor and all of the [[Directed graph|direct successors]] of ''S'' are most differentiated definitions), then ''S'' is often called ''a '''[[species]]''''' and each of its direct successors is often called ''an '''[[individual]]''''' or ''an '''[[entity]]'''''; the differentia of an individual is called ''an '''[[Identity (philosophy)|identity]]'''''. For instance:
* ''&amp;#91;the&amp;#93; Mfwitten'': a Wikipedia user with the account name 'Mfwitten'.
The identity itself (or some part of it) is often used to refer to the entire individual, a phenomenon that is known in [[linguistics]] as a [[pars pro toto]] [[synechdoche]].

===Rules for definition by genus and differentia===
{{Main|Fallacies of definition}}

Certain rules have traditionally been given for this particular type of definition.&lt;ref&gt;Copi 1982 pp 165-169&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Joyce, Ch. X&quot;&gt;Joyce, Ch. X&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, Ch. V&lt;/ref&gt;
#A definition must set out the essential attributes of the thing defined.
#Definitions should avoid circularity.  To define a horse as 'a member of the species ''equus''' would convey no information whatsoever.  For this reason, Locking{{specify|date=November 2010}} adds that a definition of a term must not comprise of terms which are synonymous with it.  This would be a circular definition, a ''circulus in definiendo''.  Note, however, that it is acceptable to define two relative terms in respect of each other.  Clearly, we cannot define 'antecedent' without using the term 'consequent', nor conversely.
#The definition must not be too wide or too narrow.  It must be applicable to everything to which the defined term applies (i.e. not miss anything out), and to nothing else (i.e. not include any things to which the defined term would not truly apply).
#The definition must not be obscure.  The purpose of a definition is to explain the meaning of a term which may be obscure or difficult, by the use of terms that are commonly understood and whose meaning is clear.  The violation of this rule is known by the Latin term ''obscurum per obscurius''.  However, sometimes scientific and philosophical terms are difficult to define without obscurity. (See the definition of [[Free will]] in Wikipedia, for instance).
#A definition should not be negative where it can be positive.  We should not define 'wisdom' as the absence of folly, or a healthy thing as whatever is not sick.  Sometimes this is unavoidable, however.  We cannot define a point except as 'something with no parts', nor blindness except as 'the absence of sight in a creature that is normally sighted'.

===Essence===
{{Main|Essence}}

In classical thought, a definition was taken to be a statement of the essence of a thing. [[Aristotle]] had it that an object's essential attributes form its &quot;essential nature&quot;, and that a definition of the object must include these essential attributes.&lt;ref&gt;[[Posterior Analytics]], Bk 1 c. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea that a definition should state the essence of a thing led to the distinction between ''nominal'' and ''real'' essence, originating with Aristotle. In a passage from the [[Posterior Analytics]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Posterior Analytics]] Bk 2 c. 7&lt;/ref&gt; he says that we can know the meaning of a made-up name (he gives the example 'goat stag'), without knowing what he calls the 'essential nature' of the thing that the name would denote, if there were such a thing.  This led medieval logicians to distinguish between what they called the ''quid nominis'' or 'whatness of the name', and the underlying nature common to all the things it names, which they called the ''quid rei'' or 'whatness of the thing'. (Early modern philosophers like Locke used the corresponding English terms 'nominal essence' and 'real essence'). The name '[[hobbit]]', for example, is perfectly meaningful. It has a ''quid nominis''. But we could not know the real nature of hobbits, even if there were such things, and so we cannot know the real nature or ''quid rei'' of hobbits. By contrast, the name 'man' denotes real things (men) that have a certain ''quid rei''. The meaning of a name is distinct from the nature that thing must have in order that the name apply to it.

This leads to a corresponding distinction between ''nominal'' and ''real'' definition. A nominal definition is the definition explaining what a word means, i.e. which says what the 'nominal essence' is, and is definition in the classical sense as given above.  A real definition, by contrast, is one expressing the real nature or ''quid rei'' of the thing.

This preoccupation with essence dissipated in much of modern philosophy. [[Analytic philosophy]] in particular is critical of attempts to elucidate the essence of a thing. [[Bertrand Russell|Russell]] described it as &quot;a hopelessly muddle-headed notion&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''A history of Western Philosophy'', p. 210&lt;/ref&gt; 

More recently [[Kripke semantics|Kripke's]] formalisation of [[possible world]] semantics in [[modal logic]] led to a new approach to [[essentialism]]. Insofar as the essential properties of a thing are ''necessary'' to it, they are those things it possesses in all possible worlds. Kripke refers to names used in this way as [[rigid designator]]s.

==Recursive definitions==
A [[recursive definition]], sometimes also called an ''inductive'' definition, is one that defines a word in terms of itself, so to speak, albeit in a useful way.  Normally this consists of three steps:
# At least one thing is stated to be a member of the set being defined; this is sometimes called a &quot;base set&quot;.
# All things bearing a certain relation to other members of the set are also to count as members of the set. It is this step that makes the definition [[Recursion|recursive]].
# All other things are excluded from the set

For instance, we could define [[natural number]] as follows (after [[Peano axioms|Peano]]): 
# &quot;0&quot; is a natural number.
# Each natural number has a distinct successor, such that:
#* the successor of a natural number is also a natural number, and
#* no natural number is succeeded by &quot;0&quot;.
# Nothing else is a natural number.

So &quot;0&quot; will have exactly one successor, which for convenience we can call &quot;1&quot;. In turn, &quot;1&quot; will have exactly one successor, which we would call &quot;2&quot;, and so on. Notice that the second condition in the definition itself refers to natural numbers, and hence involves [[self-reference]]. Although this sort of definition involves a form of [[Circular definition|circularity]], it is not [[Vicious circle principle|vicious]], and the definition has been quite successful.

==Working definitions==
A working definition is either chosen for an occasion and may not fully conform with established or authoritative definitions. Not knowing of established definitions would be grounds for selecting or devising a working definition. Or it refers to a definition being developed; a tentative definition that can be tailored to create an authoritative definition.
==Limitations of definition==
Given that a [[natural language]] such as [[English language|English]] contains, at any given time, a finite number of words, any comprehensive list of definitions must either be circular or rely upon [[primitive notion]]s. If every term of every ''definiens'' must itself be defined, &quot;where at last should we stop?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Locke, ''Essay'', [http://books.google.com/books?id=0OoNAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA33&amp;dq=%22where+at+last+should+we+stop%22+inauthor:locke&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0 Bk. III, Ch. iv, 5]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;This problem parallels the [[diallelus]], but leads to scepticism about meaning rather than knowledge.&lt;/ref&gt; A dictionary, for instance, insofar as it is a comprehensive list of [[lexical definition]]s, must resort to [[Symbol grounding|circularity]].&lt;ref&gt;Generally [[Lexicography|lexicographers]] seek to avoid circularity wherever possible, but the definitions of words such as &quot;the&quot; and &quot;a&quot; use those words and are therefore circular. [http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/the] [http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/a] Lexicographer [[Sidney I. Landau]]'s essay &quot;''Sexual Intercourse in American College Dictionaries''&quot; provides other examples of circularity in dictionary definitions. (McKean, p. 73-77)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;An exercise suggested by [[J. L. Austin]] involved taking up a dictionary and finding a selection of terms relating to the key concept, then looking up each of the words in the explanation of their meaning. Then, iterating this process until the list of words begins to repeat, closing in a “family circle” of words relating to the key concept.&lt;br&gt;(''[http://www.ditext.com/austin/plea.html A plea for excuses]'' in Philosophical Papers. Ed. [[J. O. Urmson]] and [[Geoffrey Warnock|G. J. Warnock]]. Oxford: Oxford UP, 1961. 1979.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In the game of [[Vish (game)|Vish]], players compete to find circularity in a dictionary.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many philosophers have chosen instead to leave some terms undefined. The [[Scholasticism|scholastic philosophers]] claimed that the highest genera (the so-called ten ''generalissima'') cannot be defined, since we cannot assign any higher genus under which they may fall.  Thus we cannot define [[being]], unity and similar concepts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Joyce, Ch. X&quot;&gt;Joyce, Ch. X&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Locke|Locke]] supposes in ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]''&lt;ref&gt;Locke, ''Essay'', Bk. III, Ch. iv&lt;/ref&gt; that the names of simple concepts do not admit of any definition.  More recently [[Bertrand Russell]] sought to develop a formal language based on [[Logical atomism|logical atoms]]. Other philosophers, notably [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]], rejected the need for any undefined simples. Wittgenstein pointed out in his ''[[Philosophical Investigations]]'' that what counts as a &quot;simple&quot; in one circumstance might not do so in another.&lt;ref&gt;See especially ''[[Philosophical Investigations]]'' Part 1 §48&lt;/ref&gt; He rejected the very idea that every explanation of the meaning of a term needed itself to be explained: &quot;As though an explanation hung in the air unless supported by another one&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;He continues: &quot;Whereas an explanation may indeed rest on another one that has been given, but none stands in need of another - unless ''we'' require it to prevent a misunderstanding. One might say: an explanation serves to remove or to avert a misunderstanding - one, that is, that would occur but for the explanation; not every one I can imagine.&quot; [[Philosophical Investigations]], Part 1 §87, italics in original&lt;/ref&gt; claiming instead that explanation of a term is only needed when we need to avoid misunderstanding.

Locke and [[John Stuart Mill|Mill]] also argued that we cannot define [[Principle of individuation|individuals]].  We learn names by connecting an idea with a sound, so that speaker and hearer have the same idea when the same word is used.&lt;ref&gt;This theory of meaning is one of the targets of the [[private language argument]]&lt;/ref&gt;  This is not possible when no one else is acquainted with the particular thing that has &quot;fallen under our notice&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Locke, ''Essay'', Bk. III, Ch. iii, 3&lt;/ref&gt;  Russell offered his [[theory of descriptions]] in part as a way of defining a proper name, the definition being given by a [[definite description]] that &quot;picks out&quot; exactly one individual. [[Saul Kripke]] pointed to difficulties with this approach, especially in relation to [[modal logic|modality]], in his book ''Naming and Necessity''.

There is a presumption in the classic example of a definition that the ''definiens'' can be stated. Wittgenstein argued that for some terms this is not the case.&lt;ref&gt;''Philosophical Investigations&lt;/ref&gt; The examples he used include ''game'', ''number'' and ''family''. In such cases, he argued, there is no fixed boundary that can be used to provide a definition. Rather, the items are grouped together because of a [[family resemblance]]. For terms such as these it is not possible and indeed not necessary to state a definition; rather, one simply comes to understand the ''use'' of the term.

==In medicine==
In [[medical dictionaries]], definitions should to the greatest extent possible be:
*Simple and easy to understand,&lt;ref name=McPherson1998&gt;{{cite pmid|9714637}}&lt;/ref&gt; preferably even by the general public&lt;ref name=Morse1992&gt;{{cite doi|10.1001/jama.1992.03490080086030}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Useful clinically&lt;ref name=Morse1992/&gt; or in related areas where the definition will be used.&lt;ref name=McPherson1998/&gt;
*Specific,&lt;ref name=McPherson1998/&gt; that is, by reading the definition only, it should ideally not be possible to refer to any other entity than the definiendum.

'''Disco''' is a genre of [[dance music]]. Its popularity peaked during the middle to late 1970s. It had its roots in clubs that catered to [[African American]], [[gay]], [[psychedelic]] and other communities in [[New York City]] and [[Philadelphia]] during the late 1960s and early 1970s. Disco was used as a reaction by New York City's [[gay]]s as well as [[black people|blacks]], [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Latinos]] and [[heterosexuals]] against both the domination of rock music and the demonisation of dance music by the [[counterculture]] during this period. Women embraced disco as well, and the music eventually expanded to several other popular groups of the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;alternative to rock'n'roll&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Scaruffi/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Partylikeits1975&quot;&gt;[http://www.villagevoice.com/2001-07-10/news/disco-double-take/2 Disco Double Take: New York Parties Like It’s 1975] – [[Village Voice]].com.

Musical influences include [[funk]], [[Latin music|Latin]] and [[soul music]]. The disco sound has soaring, often reverberated vocals over a steady [[four-on-the-floor (music)|&quot;four-on-the-floor&quot;]] beat, an [[eighth note]] (quaver) or 16th note (semi-quaver) [[hi-hat]] pattern with an open hi-hat on the off-beat, and a prominent, [[syncopated]] [[bass guitar|electric bass]] line sometimes consisting of octaves. The [[Fender Jazz Bass]] is often associated with disco bass lines, because the instrument itself has a very prominent 'voice' in the musical mix. In most disco tracks, strings, horns, electric pianos, and electric guitars create a lush background sound. Orchestral instruments such as the flute are often used for solo melodies, and unlike in rock, [[lead guitar]] is rarely used.

Well-known late 1970s disco performers included [[Donna Summer]], The [[Bee Gees]], [[KC and the Sunshine Band]], [[Chic (band)|Chic]], and [[The Jackson 5|The Jacksons]]. Summer would become the first well-known and most popular disco artist, giving her the title 'The Queen of Disco', and also played a part in pioneering the electronic sound that later became a part of disco (see below). While performers and singers garnered the lion's share of public attention, the behind-the-scenes producers played an equal, if not more important role in disco, since they often usually wrote the songs and created the innovative sounds and production techniques that were part of the &quot;disco sound&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allmusic.com/explore/style/d16 Disco], allmusic&lt;/ref&gt; Many non-disco artists recorded disco songs at the height of disco's popularity, and films such as ''[[Saturday Night Fever]]'' and ''[[Thank God It's Friday]]'' contributed to disco's rise in mainstream popularity.

According to music writer [[Piero Scaruffi]] the disco phenomenon spread quickly because the &quot;collective ecstasy&quot; of disco was cathartic and regenerative and led to freedom of expression.&lt;ref name=Scaruffi/&gt; Disco was the last mass popular music movement that was driven by the [[baby boom generation]].&lt;ref name=ComiskyThriller/&gt;

An angry [[backlash (sociology)|backlash]] against disco music and culture emerged in the United States, hitting its peak with the July 1979 [[Disco Demolition Night]] riot. While the popularity of disco in the United States declined markedly as a result of the backlash, the genre continued to be popular elsewhere during the 1980s.

Because the term &quot;disco&quot; became unfashionable at the start of the 1980s it was replaced by &quot;dance music&quot; and &quot;dance pop&quot; which described music powered by the basic disco beat.&lt;ref name=allmusicdisco/&gt; In the decades since, dance clubs have remained highly popular, and the disco beat has informed the sound of many of music's biggest stars. Disco has been influential on several dance music genres that have emerged since, such as [[House Music|House]], [[Nu-Disco]], [[Hi-NRG]], [[Italo Disco]], [[Eurodisco]], Disco-Funk and [[Latin Freestyle]].&lt;ref name=allmusicdisco/&gt;

== History ==
===1966–1974: Early history===
The disco sound, style and ethos has its roots in the early 1960s, as record hops and radio DJ's began to replace live bands with recorded music. Discos were first popular in Europe (where the term &quot;Discotheque&quot; was initially coined) and quickly spread to America.

During the 60s and 70s in New York City, musicians and audiences from the female, gay, black, and Latino communities, who were marginalized at the time, adopted several traits from the [[hippies]] and [[psychedelia]]. They included overwhelming sound, free-form dancing, &quot;trippy&quot; lighting, colorful costumes, and [[hallucinogens]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Scaruffi&quot;&gt;[http://www.scaruffi.com/history/cpt34.html The History of Rock and Dance Music by Piero Scaruffi]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Partylikeits1975&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cambridge/&gt;&lt;ref name=Traces/&gt; [[Psychedelic soul]] groups like the [[Chambers Brothers]] and especially [[Sly and The Family Stone]] influenced proto-disco acts such as [[Isaac Hayes]], [[Willie Hutch]] and the Philadelphia Sound.&lt;ref&gt;[{{Allmusic|class=explore|id=essay/|pure_url=yes}} Psychedelic Soul Allmusic]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the positivity, lack of irony, and earnestness of the [[hippies]] informed proto-disco music like [[M.F.S.B.]]'s &quot;Love Is the Message&quot;.&lt;ref name=Partylikeits1975/&gt;

[[Philadelphia soul|Philly]] and New York soul were evolutions of the [[Motown sound]]. The Philly Sound is typified by lavish [[percussion instrument|percussion]] and lush strings, which became a prominent part of mid-1970s disco songs. Early songs with disco elements include &quot;[[You Keep Me Hangin' On]]&quot; ([[The Supremes]], 1966), &quot;[[Only the Strong Survive (Jerry Butler song)|Only the Strong Survive]]&quot; ([[Jerry Butler (singer)|Jerry Butler]], 1968), &quot;[[Message to Love (song)|Message to Love]]&quot; ([[The Jimi Hendrix Experience]], 1969),&lt;ref&gt;[http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/Artists/H/Hendrix_Jimi/AlbumReviews/2000/10/18/771075.html CANOE – JAM! Music – Artists – Album Review: THE JIMI HENDRIX EXPERIENCE]. Canoe.ca: JAM! Music – Artists – Album Review: THE JIMI HENDRIX EXPERIENCE. ''Retrieved on August 4, 2009''.&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;[[Soul Makossa]]&quot; ([[Manu Dibango]], 1972) and &quot;[[The Love I Lost]]&quot; ([[Harold Melvin &amp; The Blue Notes]], 1973).

The early disco sound was largely an urban American phenomenon with producers and labels such as SalSoul Records (Ken, Joe and Stanley Cayre), West End Records (Mel Cheren), Casablanca (Neil Bogart), and Prelude (Marvin Schlachter) to name a few.

The disco sound was also shaped by [[Tom Moulton]] who wanted to extend the enjoyment of the music — thus creating the extended mix or &quot;[[Remix]]&quot;. This has influenced many other latter genres such as [[techno]], and [[pop music|pop]]. DJs and remixers would often remix (that is,, re-edit) existing songs using reel-to-reel tape machines. Their remixed versions would add in percussion breaks, new sections, and new sounds. Other influential DJs and remixers who helped to establish what became known as the &quot;disco sound&quot; included [[David Mancuso]], [[Nicky Siano]], [[Shep Pettibone]], the legendary and much-sought-after [[Larry Levan]], [[Walter Gibbons]], and later, New York–born Chicago &quot;Godfather of House&quot; [[Frankie Knuckles]].

Disco was also shaped by nightclub DJs such as Francis Grasso, who used multiple record players to seamlessly mix tracks from genres such as soul, funk and pop music at discothèques, and was the forerunner to later styles such as house. Women also played important roles at the turntable. Karen Cook, the first female disco DJ in the United States, spun the vinyl hits from 1974 to 1977 at 'Elan, Houston, TX, and also programmed music for clubs throughout the US that were owned by McFaddin Ventures.

Disco hit the television airwaves with [[Soul Train]] in 1971 hosted by [[Don Cornelius]], then Marty Angelo's ''[[Disco Step-by-Step Television Show]]'' in 1975, Steve Marcus' ''Disco Magic/Disco 77'', Eddie Rivera's ''Soap Factory'' and [[Merv Griffin]]'s, ''[[Dance Fever]]'', hosted by [[Deney Terrio]],The National disco champs winners of the 1977 American Bandstand, Brother and sister Dance team Gary and Gloria Poole who is credited with teaching actor [[John Travolta]] to dance for his upcoming role in the hit movie ''[[Saturday Night Fever]]''.

===1974–1978: Chart-topping songs ===
From 1974 through 1978, Disco music continued to increase in popularity as many disco songs topped the charts. The [[Hues Corporation]]'s 1974 &quot;[[Rock the Boat (Hues Corporation song)|Rock The Boat]]&quot;, a U.S. #1 [[single (music)|single]] and million-seller, was one of the early disco songs to hit #1. Another early disco hit &quot;[[Kung Fu Fighting]]&quot;, produced by [[Biddu]] and sung by [[Carl Douglas]], reached #1 in the UK and US that same year, and became the best-selling single of the year,&lt;ref name=&quot;The Book of Golden Discs&quot;&gt;{{cite book| first= Joseph| last= Murrells| year= 1978| title= The Book of Golden Discs| edition= 2nd| publisher= Barrie and Jenkins Ltd | location= London| page= 344| isbn= 0-214-20512-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; selling nine million records worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Allmusic|album|r715583|Kung Fu Fighting Remixes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other chart-topping disco hits that year included &quot;[[Walking in Rhythm]]&quot; by [[The Blackbyrds]], &quot;[[Rock Your Baby]]&quot; by [[George McCrae]], and &quot;[[Love's Theme]]&quot; by [[Barry White]]'s [[Love Unlimited Orchestra]]. Also in 1974, [[Gloria Gaynor]] released the first side-long [[disco mix]] [[gramophone record|vinyl]] [[album]], which included a remake of [[The Jackson 5]]'s &quot;[[Never Can Say Goodbye]]&quot; and two other songs, &quot;[[Honey Bee]]&quot; and &quot;[[Reach Out (I'll Be There)]]&quot;. Also significant during this early disco period was [[Miami]]'s [[KC and the Sunshine Band]]. Formed by [[Harry Wayne Casey]] (&quot;KC&quot;) and Richard Finch, KC and the Sunshine Band had a string of disco-definitive top-five hits between 1975 and 1977, including &quot;[[Get Down Tonight]]&quot;, &quot;[[That's the Way (I Like It)]]&quot;, &quot;[[(Shake, Shake, Shake) Shake Your Booty]]&quot;, &quot;[[I'm Your Boogie Man]]&quot; and &quot;[[Keep It Comin' Love]]&quot;.

The [[Bee Gees]] used [[Barry Gibb]]'s [[falsetto]] to garner hits such as &quot;[[You Should Be Dancing]]&quot;, &quot;[[Stayin' Alive]]&quot;, &quot;[[Night Fever]]&quot; and &quot;[[More Than a Woman (Bee Gees song)|More Than A Woman]]&quot;. [[Andy Gibb]], a younger brother to the Bee Gees, followed with similarly-styled solo hits such as &quot;[[I Just Want to Be Your Everything]],&quot; &quot;[[(Love Is) Thicker Than Water]]&quot; and &quot;[[Shadow Dancing (song)|Shadow Dancing]].&quot; In 1975, hits such as [[Van McCoy]]'s &quot;[[The Hustle (song)|The Hustle]]&quot; and [[Donna Summer]]'s &quot;[[Love to Love You Baby]]&quot; and &quot;[[Could It Be Magic]]&quot; brought disco further into the mainstream. Other notable early disco hits include [[The Jacksons]]’s &quot;[[Dancing Machine]]&quot; (1974), [[Barry White]]’s &quot;[[You're the First, the Last, My Everything]]&quot; (1974), [[Labelle|LaBelle]]’s &quot;[[Lady Marmalade]]&quot; (1975) and [[Silver Convention]]’s &quot;[[Fly Robin Fly]]&quot; (1975). [[Chic (band)|Chic]]'s &quot;[[Le Freak]]&quot; (1978) became a classic and is heard almost everywhere disco is mentioned; other hits by Chic include the often-sampled &quot;[[Good Times (Chic song)|Good Times]]&quot; (1979) and &quot;[[Everybody Dance (song)|Everybody Dance]]&quot; (1978).  [[Michael Jackson]] also scored his first chart-topping solo hit in the disco genre with &quot;[[Don't Stop 'til You Get Enough]]&quot; (1979). Martin Dow, an influential DJ at the time in Key West, FL was the resident DJ at The Monster, who pioneered the NYC sound across the state and was a recipient of the IRAA Gold Record for the Atlantic Records hit single &quot;Dance, Dance, Dance&quot; by Chic. He was influenced by Roy Thode, a NYC DJ who played in many NYC clubs at the time and was a close friend of Jim Burgess. Roy and Martin were notable for their ability to phase and mix three turntables simultaneously.

[[Diana Ross]] was one of the first [[Motown]] artists to embrace the disco sound with her hugely successful 1976 outing &quot;[[Love Hangover]]&quot; from her self-entitled album. Ross would continue to score disco hits for the rest of the Disco era, including the 1980 dance classics &quot;[[Upside Down]]&quot; and &quot;[[I'm Coming Out]]&quot;, (the latter immediately becoming a favorite in the gay community). Ironically enough, the group Ross led to superstardom during the 1960s, [[The Supremes]], scored a handful of hits in the disco clubs themselves, most notably 1976's &quot;[[I'm Gonna Let My Heart Do The Walking]]&quot; and, their last charted single before disbanding, 1977's '[[You're My Driving Wheel]]&quot;.  Also noteworthy are [[Cheryl Lynn]]'s &quot;[[Got to Be Real]]&quot; (1978), [[Evelyn &quot;Champagne&quot; King]]'s &quot;[[Shame]]&quot;, (also 1978), [[Cher]]'s &quot;[[Take Me Home (Cher song)|Take Me Home]]&quot; (1979), [[Sister Sledge]]'s &quot;[[We Are Family (song)|We Are Family]]&quot; (also 1979), [[Geraldine Hunt]]'s  &quot;[[Can't Fake The Feeling]]&quot; and [[Walter Murphy]]'s various attempts to bring [[classical music]] to the mainstream, most notably his hit &quot;[[A Fifth of Beethoven]]&quot; (1976).

The rich orchestral accompaniment that became identified with the disco era conjured up the memories of the [[big band]] era which brought out several artists that recorded and disco-ized some Big Band Music including [[Perry Como]], who re-recorded his 1929 and 1939 hit, Temptation, in 1975, as well as [[Ethel Merman]], who released an album of disco songs entitled ''[[The Ethel Merman Disco Album]]'' in 1979. The disco fad was even picked up by more unexpected musicians, such as country artists [[Bill Anderson (singer)|Bill Anderson]] (Double S), [[Connie Smith]] (with her cover of Andy Gibb's &quot;[[I Just Want to Be Your Everything]]&quot; and [[Ronnie Milsap]] ([[High Heel Sneakers]]). [[Myron Floren]], second-in-command on ''[[The Lawrence Welk Show]]'', released a recording of the [[Clarinet Polka]] entitled &quot;Disco Accordion.&quot; Even the ''[[I Love Lucy]]'' theme wasn't spared from being disco-ized. Other notable disco hits based on movie and television themes included the medley from Star Wars, &quot;[[Star Wars Theme/Cantina Band]]&quot; (1977), by [[Meco]], and &quot;Twilight Zone/Twilight Tone&quot; by [[The Manhattan Transfer]] (1979).

Prominent European [[Pop music|pop]] and disco groups were [[Luv']] from the Netherlands and [[Boney M]], a group of four West Indian singers and dancers masterminded by West German record producer [[Frank Farian]]. [[Boney M]] charted worldwide hits with such songs as &quot;[[Daddy Cool (Boney M. song)|Daddy Cool]]&quot;, &quot;[[Ma Baker]]&quot; and &quot;[[Rivers of Babylon]]&quot;. In France, [[Claude Francois]] who re-invented himself as the king of French disco, released &quot;[[La plus belle chose du monde]]&quot; a French version of the [[Bee Gees]] hit record, &quot;[[Massachusetts (Bee Gees song)|Massachusetts]]&quot; which became a big hit in [[Canada]] and [[Europe]] and &quot;[[Alexandrie Alexandra]]&quot; was posthumously released on the day of his burial which became a worldwide hit; &quot;[[Dalida]] released &quot;[[J'attendrai]]&quot;, which became a big hit in Canada and [[Japan]], and [[Cerrone]]'s early hit songs – &quot;[[Love In C Minor]]&quot;, &quot;[[Give Me Love]]&quot; and &quot;[[Supernature (Cerrone song)|Supernature]]&quot; – became major hits in the U.S. and Europe.

As one of the first movies to be scored with disco music before ''[[Saturday Night Fever]]'', the [[James Bond film series|James Bond film]] ''[[The Spy Who Loved Me (film)|The Spy Who Loved Me]]'' garnered great popularity from composer Marvin Hamlisch's score, especially the disco-flavored ''Bond 77'' opening track.

=== Eurodisco===
{{Main|Eurodisco}}
Eurodisco was not as funky, more pop oriented and less [[soul music|soul]] influenced than American styled disco. European acts [[Silver Convention]],  [[Love and Kisses]], [[Munich Machine]], and American acts [[Donna Summer]],  and the [[Village People]] were acts that defined the late 1970's Eurodisco sound. Producers [[Giorgio Moroder]] whom [[Allmusic]] described as &quot;one of the principal architects of the disco sound&quot; and [[Jean-Marc Cerrone]] were involved with Eurodisco.&lt;ref&gt;[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p23915|pure_url=yes}} Giorgio Moroder] Allmusic.com&lt;/ref&gt; The highly influential German group [[Kraftwerk]] is regarded by some as the first Eurodisco act.&lt;ref name=allmusicdisco/&gt; Disco lasted several years longer in Europe than it did in the United States; while disco had faded from favor by 1980 in the United States, the UK was still producing disco albums, including the [[Royal Philharmonic Orchestra]]'s famous ''[[Hooked on Classics]]'' series, which paralleled American composer Walter Murphy's earlier combinations of disco with classical music.

===1978–1980: Pop pre-eminence===
In December 1977 the film ''[[Saturday Night Fever]]'' was released. The film was marketed specifically to broaden disco's popularity beyond its primarily gay and black audience. It was a huge success, helping to make disco a worldwide phenomenon, and became the best-selling soundtrack of all time.&lt;ref name=Scaruffi/&gt; 

Disco's popularity led many non-disco artists to record disco songs at the height of its popularity. Many of their songs were not &quot;pure&quot; disco, but were instead rock or pop songs with (sometimes inescapable) disco influence or overtones. Notable examples include [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]]'s &quot;[[Heart of Glass (song)|&quot;Heart of Glass]]&quot; (1978), [[Cher]]'s &quot;[[Hell on Wheels]]&quot; (1979), [[The Rolling Stones]]' [[Miss You (The Rolling Stones song)|&quot;Miss You]]&quot; (1978), [[Barry Manilow]]’s &quot;[[Copacabana (song)|Copacabana]]&quot; (1978), [[David Bowie]] &quot;John I'm Only Dancing (Again)&quot; (1975), [[Rod Stewart]]'s &quot;[[Da Ya Think I'm Sexy?]]&quot; (1979), [[Electric Light Orchestra]]’s &quot;[[Shine a Little Love]]&quot;, &quot;[[Don't Bring Me Down]]&quot;, and &quot;[[Last Train to London]]&quot; (1979), [[George Benson]]'s &quot;[[Give Me the Night]]&quot; (1980), [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s &quot;[[Another One Bites the Dust]]&quot; (1980), [[Paul McCartney &amp; Wings]]' &quot;[[Goodnight Tonight]]&quot; (1979), [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]]' &quot;[[I Was Made For Lovin' You]]&quot; (1979) and [[Pink Floyd]]'s [[Another Brick In The Wall]] (1979).

Several parodies of the disco style were created, most notably &quot;[[Disco Duck]]&quot; and &quot;[[Dancin' Fool]]&quot;. [[Rick Dees]], at the time a radio DJ in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], recorded &quot;Disco Duck&quot;; [[Frank Zappa]] parodied the lifestyles of disco dancers in &quot;Dancin' Fool&quot; on his 1979 [[Sheik Yerbouti]] album.

=== 1979–1981 Backlash and decline===
{{See also|Disco Demolition Night}}
Though disco music had enjoyed several years of popularity, an anti-disco sentiment manifested itself, particularly in America. Many musicians and fans of a variety of rock music styles expressed strong disapproval of disco throughout the height of its popularity.&lt;ref name=allmusicdisco/&gt; Among these critics, the slogans &quot;disco sucks&quot; and &quot;death to disco&quot;&lt;ref name=allmusicdisco/&gt; were common by the late 1970s and appeared in written form in places ranging from tee shirts to graffiti.&lt;ref&gt;(2001) &quot;Encyclopedia of Contemporary American Culture&quot;, ISBN 978-0-415-16161-9, 9780415161619, p.217: &quot;In fact, by 1977, before punk spread, there was a &quot;disco sucks&quot; movement sponsored by radio stations that attracted suburban white youth, who insisted that disco was escapist, synthetic and overproduced.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Christgau&quot;&gt;[http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/pnj/pj78.php Robert Christgau: Pazz &amp; Jop 1978: New Wave Hegemony and the Bebop Question] [[Robert Christgau]] for the [[Village Voice]] Pop &amp; Jop Poll 1978  January 22, 1979&lt;/ref&gt; Radio DJs organized mass burnings of [[Bee Gees]] albums and posters.&lt;ref name=&quot;BeeGees&quot;&gt;[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p3652|pure_url=yes}} Allmusic BeeGees bio]&lt;/ref&gt; Rock artists such as [[Rod Stewart]] and [[David Bowie]] who added disco elements to their music were accused of being [[sell out]]s.&lt;ref name=Christgau/&gt;&lt;ref name=espn/&gt;

The [[punk subculture]] both in the United States and United Kingdom&lt;ref name=allmusicdisco&gt;[http://www.allmusic.com/explore/essay/disco-t2151 Allmusic Disco Genre]&lt;/ref&gt; was often very critical of disco, even to the point of being downright hostile. [[Jello Biafra]] of [[The Dead Kennedys]] likened disco to the cabaret culture of [[Weimar Germany]] for its apathy towards government policy and its escapism (which Biafra saw as delusional). He sang about this in the song &quot;Saturday Night Holocaust&quot;, the B-side of the song &quot;[[Halloween (Dead Kennedys song)|Halloween]]&quot;. [[Mark Mothersbaugh]] of [[Devo]] has said that Disco was &quot;like a beautiful woman with a great body and no brains&quot; and a product of political apathy of that era.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.juicemagazine.com/devo.html DEVO and the evolution of The Wipeouters interview with MARK MOTHERSBAUGH Juice Magazine]&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from Mothersbaugh's and Biafra's criticism, punk fans shared the &quot;disco sucks&quot; sentiment of other rock fans. New Jersey rock critic [[Jim Testa]] wrote &quot;[[Put a Bullet Through The Jukebox]]&quot;, a vitriolic screed attacking disco that was a punk call to arms.&lt;ref name=&quot;Testa&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mark Andersen|author2=Mark Jenkins|title=Dance of days: two decades of punk in the nation's capital|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=CU1jKq0TlvQC&amp;pg=PA17|accessdate=21 March 2011|date=1 August 2003|publisher=Akashic Books|isbn=9781888451443|pages=17–}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Rich-in-70s.jpg|thumb|Man wearing ''Disco Sucks'' T-Shirt]]

July 12, 1979 became known as &quot;the day disco died&quot; because of an anti-disco demonstration that was held in Chicago.&lt;ref name=Campion&gt;Campoin (2009), p.&amp;nbsp;82–84.&lt;/ref&gt; Rock station DJs [[Steve Dahl]] and [[Garry Meier]], along with [[Michael Veeck]], son of [[Chicago White Sox]] owner [[Bill Veeck]], staged ''[[Disco Demolition Night]],'' a promotional event with an anti-disco theme, between games at a White Sox doubleheader for disgruntled rock fans. During this event, which involved exploding disco records, the raucous crowd tore out seats and turf in the field and did other damage to [[Comiskey Park]]. It ended in a riot in which police made numerous arrests. The damage done to the field forced the Sox to forfeit the second game to the [[Detroit Tigers]] who won the first game. The stadium suffered thousands of dollars in damage.

On July 21—six days after the riot—the top six records on the U.S. charts were of the disco genre. By September 22, there were no disco records in the top 10. The media, in celebratory tones, declared disco dead and rock revived.&lt;ref name=&quot;ComiskyThriller&quot;&gt;[http://blogs.wnyc.org/culture/2009/07/13/from-comiskey-park-to-thriller-how-the-pop-music-audience-was-torn-apart-and-then-put-back-together/ From Comiskey Park to Thriller: The Effect of “Disco Sucks” on Pop] by [[Steve Greenberg (record producer)|Steve Greenberg]] founder and CEO of [[S-Curve Records]] July 10, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The anti-disco backlash, combined with other societal and radio industry factors, changed the face of pop radio in the years following disco-demolition night. [[Top 40]] radio stations avoided playing music by black artists in an effort to prevent their stations from being labeled with the dreaded &quot;disco&quot; tag.  One of the more popular of these formats, [[country music]], rose into favor when ''[[Saturday Night Fever]]'' star [[John Travolta]] had a hit with the film ''[[Urban Cowboy]]'', a movie that has been perceived as a rejection of disco.{{dead|date=April 2011}}

The television industry—taking a cue from the music industry—responded with an anti-disco agenda as well. A recurring theme on the television show ''[[WKRP in Cincinnati]]'' was a hateful attitude towards disco music.

It was during this backlash and decline that several record companies were folded, reorganized or sold. In 1979, [[MCA Records]] bought [[ABC Records]] and shut it down. [[Casablanca Records]]' founder [[Neil Bogart]] was forced out in 1980 by label owner [[PolyGram]]. [[RSO Records]] founder [[Robert Stigwood]] left the label in 1981. [[TK Records]] closed in 1981. [[Salsoul Records]] managed to hang on until 1984.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.disco-disco.com/labels/salsoul.shtml Salsoul Records @]. Disco-disco.com. Retrieved on 2011-03-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Factors  ====
A bad economy, political chaos that would lead to the election of [[Ronald Reagan]],&lt;ref name=BeeGees/&gt; and [[burnout (psychology)|burnout]] brought on by the hedonistic lifestyles led by participants (along with the emergence of [[AIDS]]) also have been cited as factors leading to the decline of the genre .&lt;ref name=BeeGees/&gt; According to [[Gloria Gaynor]], the music industry supported the destruction of disco because rock music producers were losing money and rock musicians were losing the spotlight.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emplive.org/exhibits/index.asp?articleID=622 empsfm.org – EXHIBITIONS – Featured Exhibitions]&lt;/ref&gt; Disco was criticized for being [[elitism|elitist]]. Songs such as [[Frank Zappa]]'s satirical song [[Sheik Yerbouti|&quot;Dancin' Fool&quot;]] and Steve Dahl's &quot;Do Ya Think I'm Disco?&quot; described patrons of exclusive discos as being overdressed and vapid.&lt;ref name=espn/&gt;

In January 1979 rock critic [[Robert Christgau]] wrote that [[homophobia]] and most likely [[racism]] were reasons behind the backlash.&lt;ref name=Christgau/&gt; a conclusion seconded by [[John Rockwell]] in ''[[The New York Times]]''. In the years since Disco Demolition night, social critics have described the backlash as implicitly macho and bigoted and an attack on non-white and non-heterosexual cultures.&lt;ref name=allmusicdisco/&gt;&lt;ref name=espn/&gt;&lt;ref name=Campion/&gt; [[Legs McNeil]], founder of the [[fanzine]] [[Punk (magazine)|''Punk'']], was quoted in an interview as saying, &quot;the hippies always wanted to be black.

===1990–Present: Resurgence===

In the late 1980s and increasingly through the 1990s, a revival of the original disco style began to emerge. The disco influence can be heard in such songs as [[Rick Astley]]'s &quot;[[Never Gonna Give You Up]]&quot; (1988),&lt;ref&gt;Rick Astley [http://www.allmusic.com/song/never-gonna-give-you-up-t1906428 Never Gonna Give You Up. Song review] Allmusic&lt;/ref&gt; [[Deee-Lite]]'s [[Groove Is in the Heart]] (1990), [[Gloria Estefan]]'s &quot;[[Get On Your Feet]]&quot; (1991), [[Paula Abdul]]'s &quot;[[Vibeology]]&quot; (1992), [[Whitney Houston]]'s &quot;[[I'm Every Woman]]&quot; (1993), [[U2]]’s &quot;[[Lemon (U2 song)|Lemon]]&quot; (1993), [[Diana Ross]]'s &quot;[[Take Me Higher]]&quot; (1995), [[France Joli]]'s &quot;Touch&quot; (1996), [[Spice Girls]]' &quot;[[Who Do You Think You Are]]&quot; (1997), [[Gloria Estefan]]'s &quot;[[Heaven's What I Feel]]&quot; (1998) &amp; &quot;[[Don't Let This Moment End]]&quot; (1999), [[George Michael]]'s [[Outside (George Michael song)|Outside]] (1998), [[Cher]]’s &quot;[[Strong Enough (Cher song)|Strong Enough]]&quot; (1998), and [[Jamiroquai]]'s &quot;[[Canned Heat (song)|Canned Heat]]&quot; (1999).

The trend continued in the 2000s with hit songs such as [[Kylie Minogue]]'s &quot;[[Spinning Around]]&quot; (2000) as well as her album &quot;[[Light Years (Kylie Minogue album)|Light Years]]&quot; (2000), [[Sheena Easton]]'s &quot;Givin' Up, Givin' In&quot; (2001), [[Michael Jackson]]'s &quot;[[You Rock My World]]&quot; (2001), [[Sophie Ellis-Bextor]]'s &quot;[[Murder on the Dancefloor]]&quot; (2001), [[Mýa]]'s &quot;[[Free (Mýa song)|Free]]&quot; (2001) [[RuPaul]]'s &quot;[[Looking Good, Feeling Gorgeous]]&quot;, (2004) [[Janet Jackson]]'s &quot;[[R&amp;B Junkie]]&quot;, (2004) [[La Toya Jackson]]'s &quot;[[Just Wanna Dance]]&quot; (2004) &amp; &quot;[[Free the World]]&quot; (2005). [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s 2005 album ''[[Confessions on a Dance Floor]]'' echoes traditional disco themes, particularly in the single &quot;[[Hung Up]]&quot;, which samples [[ABBA]]'s &quot;[[Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)]]&quot;. Madonna continued doing disco music in her 2008 release, &quot;[[Hard Candy (Madonna album)|Hard Candy]]&quot;, this time experimenting with the old days of funk- and soul-influenced disco in songs like &quot;Beat Goes On&quot; and &quot;Dance 2nite&quot;.

In the early 2000s, the genre of music known as [[dance-punk]] enjoyed increased popularity. Dance-punk bands like [[The Rapture (band)|The Rapture]], [[!!!]], and [[LCD Soundsystem]] fused elements of [[punk rock]] with different forms of dance music, especially disco. 

In the mid-late part of the decade, many disco songs have been released, becoming hits, including (2005) [[Gorillaz]]'s &quot;[[DARE (song)|Dare]]&quot;, [[Ultra Nate]]'s &quot;Love's The Only Drug&quot; (2006), [[Gina G]]'s &quot;Tonight's The Night&quot; (2006), The Shapeshifters' &quot;Back To Basics&quot; (2006), Michael Gray's &quot;Borderline&quot; (2006), [[Irene Cara]]'s &quot;Forever My Love&quot; (2006), [[Bananarama]]'s &quot;[[Look on the Floor (Hypnotic Tango)]]&quot;, the [[Freemasons (band)|Freemasons]] &quot;Rain Down Love&quot; (2007), [[Claudja Barry]]'s &quot;I Will Stand&quot; (2006), [[Pepper Mashay]]'s &quot;Lost Yo Mind&quot; (2007), [[Sophie Ellis-Bextor]]’s &quot;[[Me and My Imagination]]&quot; (2007), [[Maroon 5]]'s &quot;[[Makes Me Wonder]]&quot; (2007) [[Justice (French band)|Justice]]’s &quot;[[D.A.N.C.E.]]&quot;, &quot;[[Phantom (song)|Phantom (Part II)]]&quot; (2007), [[Dannii Minogue]]'s &quot;[[Touch Me Like That]]&quot; (2007), [[Cerrone]]'s &quot;Misunderstanding&quot; and &quot;Tattoo Woman&quot; (2008), [[Sean Ensign]]'s &quot;I Wanna Be With You&quot; (2008), [[Donna Summer]]'s &quot;[[I'm a Fire]]&quot; (2008), [[Jody Watley]]'s &quot;A Beautiful Life&quot; (2008), [[Crystal Waters]]'s &quot;Dancefloor&quot; (2008), [[Alcazar (band)|Alcazar]]'s comeback single &quot;[[We Keep on Rockin']]&quot; (2008), [[RuPaul]]'s &quot;[[Jealous Of My Boogie]]&quot; (2009)&quot;, [[Shakira]]'s &quot;[[She Wolf (song)|She Wolf]]&quot; (2009), [[Whitney Houston]]'s &quot;[[Million Dollar Bill]]&quot; (2009), [[Lady Gaga]]'s &quot;[[Alejandro (song)|Alejandro]]&quot; (2010), and [[Katy Perry]]'s song &quot;[[California Gurls]]&quot; (2010). Music producer, [[Ian Levine]] has  also produced many new songs with such singers as George Daniel Long, [[Hazell Dean]], [[Sheila Ferguson]], [[Steve Brookstein]] and [[Tina Charles (singer)|Tina Charles]] among others for the compilation album titled, ''[[Disco 2008]]'', a tribute to Disco music using original material.

In the 2000s, artists such as [[Duck Sauce (band)|Duck Sauce]], [[DE SIGNER]], [[Ali Love]], [[Hercules and Love Affair]] and producer [[JMV]] have revived the disco sound helping bring further mainstream interest and success. Disco tributes continue to be popular draws. The [[World's Largest Disco]], an annual celebration held over [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]] weekend in [[Buffalo, New York]], draws thousands of disco fans in 1970s-era attire. In addition to playing disco hits of the era, live performers from the 1970s make appearances. One surprising place disco arrived and then never went away is English Junior schools. By 1975 discos began for young children and are still an annual feature in many schools today.

The &quot;disco sound&quot;, while unique, almost defies a unified description, as it is an ultra-inclusive art form that draws on as many influences as it produces interpretations. [[Jazz]], [[classical music|classical]], [[Calypso music|calypso]], [[Rock music|rock]], [[Latin music|Latin]], [[Soul music|soul]], [[funk]], and new technologies — just to name a few of the obvious — were all mingled with aplomb. Vocals can be frivolous or serious love intrigues — all the way to extremely serious socially-conscious commentary.

The music tended to layer soaring, often-reverberated vocals, which are often doubled by horns, over a background &quot;pad&quot; of electric pianos and wah-pedaled &quot;chicken-scratch&quot; guitars. Other backing keyboard instruments include the [[piano]], organ (during early years), string synth, and electroacoustic keyboards such as the Fender Rhodes piano, Wurlitzer electric piano, and Hohner Clavinet. Synthesizers are also fairly common in disco, especially in the late 1970s. The rhythm is laid down by prominent, syncopated basslines (with heavy use of octaves) played on the [[bass guitar]] and by drummers using a [[drum kit]], African/[[Latin percussion]], and [[electronic drum]]s such as Simmons and [[Roland Corporation|Roland]] [[sound module|drum modules]]). The sound is enriched with solo lines and harmony parts played by a variety of orchestral instruments, such as [[harp]], [[violin]], [[viola]], [[cello]], [[trumpet]], [[saxophone]], [[trombone]], [[clarinet]], [[flugelhorn]], [[French horn]], [[tuba]], [[English horn]], [[oboe]], [[flute]] (sometimes especially the [[alto flute]] and occasionally [[bass flute]]), [[piccolo]], [[timpani]] and [[synthesizer|synth strings]] or a full-blown [[string orchestra]].

Most disco songs have a steady [[four-on-the-floor (music)|four-on-the-floor]] beat, a [[quaver]] or semi-quaver [[hi-hat]] pattern with an open hi-hat on the off-beat, and a heavy, syncopated bass line. This basic beat would appear to be related to the Dominican [[Merengue music|merengue]] rhythm. Other Latin rhythms such as the rhumba, the samba and the cha-cha-cha are also found in disco recordings, and Latin [[polyrhythm]]s, such as a rhumba beat layered over a merengue, are commonplace. The quaver pattern is often supported by other instruments such as the rhythm guitar and may be implied rather than explicitly present. It often involves [[syncopation]], rarely occurring on the beat unless a [[synthesizer]] is used to replace the bass guitar. In general, the difference between a disco, or any dance song, and a rock or popular song is that in dance music the bass hits ''four to the floor'', at least once a beat (which in 4/4 time is 4 beats per measure), whereas in rock the bass hits on one and three and lets the snare take the lead on two and four. Disco is further characterized by a 16th note division of the quarter notes established by the bass as shown in the second drum pattern below, after a typical rock drum pattern.

The orchestral sound usually known as &quot;disco sound&quot; relies heavily on strings and horns playing linear phrases, in unison with the soaring, often reverberated vocals or playing instrumental fills, while electric pianos and chicken-scratch guitars create the background &quot;pad&quot; sound defining the harmony progression. Typically, a rich &quot;[[wall of sound]]&quot; results. There are, however, more minimalistic flavors of disco with reduced, transparent instrumentation, pioneered by Chic.

In 1977, [[Giorgio Moroder]] again became responsible for a development in disco. Alongside [[Donna Summer]] and [[Pete Bellotte]] he wrote the song &quot;[[I Feel Love]]&quot; for Summer to perform. It became the first well-known disco hit to have a completely synthesised backing track. The song is still considered to have been well ahead of its time. Other disco producers, most famously [[Tom Moulton]], grabbed ideas and techniques from dub music (which came with the increased [[Jamaican]] migration to New York City in the seventies) to provide alternatives to the four on the floor style that dominated. [[Larry Levan]] utilized style keys from [[Dub music|dub]] and [[jazz]] and more as one of the most successful remixers of all time to create early versions of [[house music]] that sparked the genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Production===
The &quot;disco sound&quot; was much more costly to produce than many of the other popular music genres from the 1970s. Unlike the simpler, four-piece band sound of the funk, soul of the late 1960s, or the small [[jazz]] [[organ trio]]s, disco music often included a large pop band, with several chordal instruments (guitar, keyboards, synthesizer), several drum or percussion instruments (drumkit, Latin percussion, electronic drums), a [[horn section]], a [[string orchestra]], and a variety of &quot;classical&quot; solo instruments (for example,, flute, piccolo, and so on.).

Disco songs were [[arrangement|arranged]] and composed by experienced arrangers and [[orchestration|orchestrators]], and producers added their creative touches to the overall sound. Recording complex arrangements with such a large number of instruments and sections required a team that included a [[Conductor (music)|conductor]], [[copyist]]s, [[record producer]]s, and [[audio engineering|mixing engineers]]. Mixing engineers had an important role in the disco production process, because disco songs used as many as 64 [[sound recording|tracks]] of vocals and instruments. Mixing engineers compiled these tracks into a fluid composition of verses, bridges, and refrains, complete with [[orchestral build]]s and [[break (music)|breaks]]. Mixing engineers helped to develop the &quot;disco sound&quot; by creating a distinctive-sounding [[disco mix]].

Early records were the &quot;standard&quot; 3&amp;nbsp;minute version until [[Tom Moulton]] came up with a way to make songs longer, wanting to take a crowd to another level that was impossible with 45-RPM vinyl discs of the time (which could usually hold no more than 5&amp;nbsp;minutes of good-quality music). With the help of José Rodriguez, his remasterer, he pressed a single on a 10&quot; disc instead of 7&quot;. They cut the next single on a 12&quot; disc, the same format as a standard album. This method fast became the standard format for all DJs of the genre.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.disco-disco.com/disco/history.shtml The Disco History page !], Disco-Disco.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Because record sales were often dependent on floor play in clubs, [[disc jockey|DJs]] were also important to the development and popularization of disco music. Notable DJs include Rex Potts (Loft Lounge, Sarasota, Florida), Karen Cook, [[Jim Burgess (producer)|Jim Burgess]], [[Walter Gibbons]], [[John &quot;Jellybean&quot; Benitez]], Richie Kaczar of [[Studio 54]], Rick Gianatos, [[Francis Grasso]] of Sanctuary, [[Larry Levan]], [[Ian Levine]], Neil &quot;Raz&quot; Rasmussen &amp; Mike Pace of L'amour Disco in Brooklyn, Preston Powell of Magique, Jennie Costa of Lemontrees, Tee Scott, Tony Smith of [[Xenon]], John Luongo, Robert Ouimet of [[The Limelight]], and [[David Mancuso]].

==Disco clubs and culture==
In October 1975 notable discos included &quot;Studio One&quot; in Los Angeles, &quot;Leviticus&quot; in New York and &quot;The Library&quot; in Atlanta.&lt;ref name=Disco197510/&gt;

[[File:Blue disco quad roller skates.jpg|Blue disco quad roller skates|thumb]]
By the late 1970s most major U.S. cities had thriving disco club scenes, but the largest scenes were in [[San Francisco]], [[Miami]], and most notably [[New York City]]. The scene was centered on [[discotheque]]s, nightclubs, and private loft parties where [[DJ]]s would play disco hits through powerful [[PA system]]s for the patrons who came to dance. The DJs played &quot;...a smooth mix of long single records to keep people 'dancing all night long'&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/courier/2000_07/uk/doss13.htm The Body and soul of club culture]&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the most prestigious clubs had elaborate lighting systems that throbbed to the beat of the music.

At the height of the disco era, McFaddin Ventures were operating many successful and profitable nightclubs. In an effort to maximize profit, McFaddin Ventures in Houston, Texas commissioned a study on the stimulation of males and females during the playing of music. They accordingly custom tuned their speakers to make their numerous clubs more exciting. Their programmer/disc jockey, '''[http://www.facebook.com/karenmixoncook Karen Cook]''', was the first female disco DJ in the states {{Confirmation by Lance McFaddin, Principal of McFaddin Ventures and Judy Meyer}} and trained other McFaddin Ventures discjockeys to work their music format (6 up, 3 down) which was designed to sell more drinks. Karen is currently Producer/Director at [http://www.VividMix.com VividMix].

In the late 1970s, [[Studio 54]] was arguably the most well known nightclub in the world. This club played a major formative role in the growth of disco music and [[nightclub]] culture in general.

=== Disco dancing ===
In the early years dancers in discos danced in a &quot;hang loose&quot; style. Popular dances included &quot;Bump&quot;, &quot;Penguin&quot;, &quot;Boogaloo, &quot;Watergate&quot; and the &quot;Robot&quot;. By October 1975 [[Hustle (dance)|The Hustle]] reigned. It was highly stylized, sophisticated and sexy. Variations included the [[Brooklyn Hustle]], [[New York Hustle]] and [[Latin Hustle]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Disco197510&quot;&gt;[http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=gQQ1AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Fk8KAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=840,3518488&amp;dq=disco+music&amp;hl=en Everybody's Doing The hustle], Associated Press, October 16, 1975&lt;/ref&gt;

During the disco era, many nightclubs would commonly host disco dance competitions or offer free instructional lessons. Some cities had disco dance instructors or dance schools which taught people how to do popular disco dances such as &quot;[[touch dancing]]&quot;, &quot;the hustle&quot; and &quot;[[Cha-cha-cha (dance)|the cha cha]]&quot;. The pioneer of disco dance instruction was '''Karen Lustgarten''' in San Francisco in 1973. Her book '''The Complete Guide to Disco Dancing''' (Warner Books, 1978) was the first to name, break down and codify popular disco dances as a dance form and distinguish between disco freestyle, partner and line dances. The book hit the New York Times Best Seller List for 13 weeks and was translated into Chinese, German and French.

Some notable professional dance troupes of the 1970s included [[Pan's People]] and [[Hot Gossip]]. For many dancers, the primary influence of the 1970s disco age is still predominantly the film ''[[Saturday Night Fever]]'' (1977). This developed into the music and dance style of such films as ''[[Fame (1980 film)|Fame]]'' (1980), ''[[Flashdance]]'' (1983),&quot;[[The Last Days of Disco]]&quot;(1998). It also helped spawn dance competition TV shows such as [[Dance Fever]] (1979).

=== Disco fashion ===
Disco fashions were very trendy in the late 1970s. Discothèque-goers often wore expensive and extravagant fashions for nights out at their local disco, such as sheer, flowing [[Halston]] dresses for women and shiny polyester [[Qiana]] shirts for men with pointy collars, preferably open at the chest, often worn with [[double-knit]] polyester shirt jackets with matching trousers known as the leisure suit. [[Necklace]]s and [[medal]]lions were a common [[fashion accessory]].

=== Hedonism: drug subculture and sexual promiscuity ===
In addition to the dance and fashion aspects of the disco club scene, there was also a thriving drug [[subculture]], particularly for drugs that would enhance the experience of dancing to the loud music and the flashing lights, such as [[cocaine]]&lt;ref&gt;Gootenberg, Paul 1954–
– Between Coca and Cocaine: A Century or More of U.S.-Peruvian Drug Paradoxes, 1860–1980
– Hispanic American Historical Review – 83:1, February 2003, pp. 119–150. &quot;The relationship of cocaine to 1970s disco culture cannot be stressed enough ...&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; (nicknamed &quot;blow&quot;), amyl nitrite &quot;[[poppers]]&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Amyl, butyl and isobutyl nitrite (collectively known as alkyl nitrites) are clear, yellow liquids which are inhaled for their intoxicating effects. Nitrites originally came as small glass capsules that were popped open. This led to nitrites being given the name 'poppers' but this form of the drug is rarely found in the UK. The drug became popular in the UK first on the disco/club scene of the 1970s and then at dance and rave venues in the 1980s and 1990s.&lt;/ref&gt; and the &quot;...other quintessential 1970s club drug [[Quaalude]], which suspended [[motor coordination]] and gave the sensation that one’s arms and legs had turned to [[Jell-O]].&quot;&lt;ref name=r1&gt;Peter Braunstein [http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/1999/7/1999_7_43.shtml DISCO], American Heritage Magazine&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Peter Braunstein]], the &quot;massive quantities of drugs ingested in discotheques produced the next [[cultural phenomenon]] of the disco era: rampant [[promiscuity]] and [[public sex]]. While the dance floor was the central arena of [[seduction]], actual sex usually took place in the nether regions of the disco: bathroom stalls, exit [[stairwell]]s, and so on. In other cases the disco became a kind of 'main course' in a [[hedonism|hedonist’s]] menu for a night out.&quot;&lt;ref name=r1/&gt;

Famous disco bars included the very important [[Paradise Garage]] and [[Crisco Disco]] as well as &quot;...cocaine-filled [[celebrity|celeb]] hangouts such as [[Manhattan]]'s [[Studio 54]]&quot;, which was operated by [[Steve Rubell]] and [[Ian Schrager]]. Studio 54 was notorious for the [[hedonism]] that went on within; the balconies were known for [[sexual encounters]], and drug use was rampant. Its dance floor was decorated with an image of the &quot;[[Man in the Moon]]&quot; that included an animated [[cocaine spoon]].

==Influence on other music==
===1982–1990: Post disco and dance===
{{Main|Post Disco}}
The transition from the late-1970s disco styles to the early-1980s dance styles was marked primarily by the change from complex arrangements performed by [[big band|large ensembles]] of studio session musicians (including a [[horn section]] and an orchestral [[string section]]), to a leaner sound, in which one or two singers would perform to the accompaniment of [[synthesizer]] [[Keyboard instrument|keyboards]] and [[drum machine]]s.

In addition, [[dance music]] during the 1981–83 period borrowed elements from [[blues]] and [[jazz]], creating a style different from the disco of the 1970s. This emerging music was still known as disco for a short time, as the word had become associated with any kind of dance music played in [[discothèque]]s. Examples of early 1980s dance sound performers include [[D. Train]], [[Kashif (musician)|Kashif]], and [[Patrice Rushen]]. These changes were influenced by some of the notable R&amp;B and jazz musicians of the 1970s, such as Stevie Wonder, Kashif and [[Herbie Hancock]], who had pioneered &quot;[[Multi-instrumentalist|one-man-band]]&quot;-type keyboard techniques. Some of these influences had already begun to emerge during the mid-1970s, at the height of disco’s popularity.

Songs such as [[Gloria Gaynor]]’s &quot;[[Never Can Say Goodbye]]&quot; (1974), [[Thelma Houston]]’s &quot;[[Don't Leave Me This Way]]&quot; (1976), [[Donna Summer]]’s &quot;[[Spring Affair]]&quot; (1977), [[Rod Stewart]]’s &quot;[[Do Ya Think I'm Sexy?]]&amp;amp;quot; (1978), [[Donna Summer]]’s &quot;[[Bad Girls (song)|Bad Girls]]&quot; (1979), and [[The Bee Gees]]’ &quot;[[Love You Inside Out]]&quot; (1979) foreshadowed the dramatic change in dance music styles which was to follow in the 1980s.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the first years of the 1980s, the &quot;disco sound&quot; began to be phased out, and faster tempos and synthesized effects, accompanied by guitar and simplified backgrounds, moved dance music toward the funk and pop genres. This trend can be seen in singer [[Billy Ocean]]'s recordings between 1979 and 1981. Whereas Ocean's 1979 song ''American Hearts'' was backed with an orchestral arrangement played by the [[Los Angeles Symphony Orchestra]], his 1981 song ''&quot;One of Those Nights (Feel Like Gettin' Down)&quot;'' had a more bare, stripped-down sound, with no orchestration or [[symphonic]] arrangements. This drift from the original disco sound is called [[post-disco]]. In this music scene there are rooted sub-genres, such as [[italo-disco]], [[techno]], [[house music|house]], [[dance-pop]], [[boogie (genre)|boogie]], and early [[alternative dance]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AMG1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=explore|id=style/d13417|pure_url=yes}}|title=Explore music…Genre: Post-disco|publisher=Allmusic|accessdate=2009-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early 1980s, dance music dropped the complicated melodic structure and orchestration which typified the &quot;disco sound&quot;. Examples of well-known songs which illustrate this difference include [[Kool &amp; the Gang]]’s &quot;[[Celebration (song)|Celebration]]&quot; (1980), [[Rick James]]’ &quot;[[Super Freak]]&quot; (1981), [[Grace Jones]]'s &quot;[[Pull Up to the Bumper]]&quot; (1981), [[Carol Jiani]]'s &quot;Hit N' Run Lover&quot; (1981), [[Laura Branigan]]'s &quot;[[Gloria (Umberto Tozzi/Laura Branigan song)|Gloria]]&quot; (1982), [[The Pointer Sisters]]’ &quot;[[I'm So Excited]]&quot; (1982), [[Prince (musician)|Prince]]’s &quot;[[1999 (song)|1999]]&quot; (1982), [[The Weather Girls]]'s &quot;[[It's Raining Men]]&quot; (1982), [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]’s &quot;[[Holiday (Madonna song)|Holiday]]&quot; (1983), [[Irene Cara]]'s &quot;[[Flashdance (What A Feeling)]]&quot; (1983), [[Angela Bofill]]'s &quot;Too Tough&quot; (1983), [[Miquel Brown]]'s &quot;[[So Many Men, So Little Time]]&quot; (1983), [[Michael Jackson]]’s &quot;[[Thriller (song)|Thriller]]&quot; (1983), [[Stevie Nicks]]' &quot;[[Stand Back]]&quot; (1983), [[Cerrone]]'s &quot;Back Track&quot; (1984), [[Jocelyn Brown]]'s &quot;Somebody Else's Guy&quot; (1984), and [[Klymaxx]]'s &quot;Meeting in the Ladies Room&quot; (1984).

===TV themes===
During the 1970s, many TV theme songs were produced (or older themes updated) with disco influenced music. Examples include ''[[S.W.A.T. (TV Series)|S.W.A.T.]]'' (1975), ''[[Charlie's Angels]]'' (1976), ''NBC Saturday Night At The Movies'' (1976), ''[[The Love Boat]]'' (1977), ''[[The Donahue Show]]'' (1977), ''[[CHiPs]]'' (1977), ''The Professionals'' (1977), ''[[Dallas (TV series)|Dallas]]'' (1978), ''[[Kojak]]'' (1978), and ''20/20'' or [[Mike Post]] &amp; [[Pete Carpenter]]'s ''Showtime'' (1983) from ''[[The A-Team]]'', which kept the disco sound throughout the 1980s. The British Science Fiction program ''[[Space: 1999]]'' (1975) also featured a soundtrack strongly influenced by disco. This was especially evident in the show's second season.

===DJ culture===
The rising popularity of disco came in tandem with developments in [[turntablism]] and the use of records to create a continuous mix of songs. The resulting [[DJ mix]] differed from previous forms of dance music, which were oriented towards live performances by musicians. This in turn affected the arrangement of dance music, with songs since the disco era typically containing beginnings and endings marked by a simple beat or riff that can be easily slipped into the mix.

===Rave culture===
{{main|Rave}}
As the Disco era came to a close in the late 70's, [[Rave]] culture began to see significant growth. Rave culture incorporated Disco culture's same love of dance music, drug exploration, sexual promiscuity, and [[hedonism]]. Although disco culture had thrived in the mainsteam, the rave culture would make an effort to stay underground to avoid the animosity that was still surrounding disco and dance music.

===Hip hop and electro===
The disco sound had a strong influence on early [[hip hop music|hip hop]]. Most of the early rap/hip-hop songs were created by isolating existing disco bass-guitar lines and dubbing over them with MC rhymes. [[The Sugarhill Gang]] used [[Chic (band)|Chic]]'s &quot;[[Good Times (Chic song)|Good Times]]&quot; as the foundation for their 1979 hit &quot;[[Rapper's Delight]]&quot;, generally considered to be the song that first popularized Rap music in the United States and around the world. In 1982, [[Afrika Bambataa]] released the single &quot;[[Planet Rock (song)|Planet Rock]]&quot;, which incorporated electronica elements from [[Kraftwerk]]'s &quot;[[Trans-Europe Express (album)|Trans-Europe Express]]&quot; and &quot;Numbers.&quot; The &quot;Planet Rock&quot; sound also spawned a [[hip-hop]] electronic dance trend ([[electro music]]), which included such songs as [[Planet Patrol]]'s &quot;Play At Your Own Risk&quot; (1982), C Bank's &quot;One More Shot&quot; (1982), [[Cerrone]]'s &quot;Club Underworld&quot; (1984), [[Shannon (singer)|Shannon]]'s &quot;[[Let the Music Play (song)|Let the Music Play]]&quot; (1983), [[Freeez]]'s &quot;I.O.U.&quot; (1983), [[Midnight Star]]'s &quot;Freak-A-Zoid&quot; (1983), [[Chaka Khan]]'s &quot;[[I Feel For You]]&quot; (1984).

===Post Punk===
{{Main|Post Punk}}
The [[Post Punk]] movement that originated in the late 1970s both supported [[Punk Rock]]'s rule breaking while rejecting its back to raw [[rock music]] element.&lt;ref name=Reynolds/&gt; Post Punk's mantra of constantly moving forward lent itself to both openness to and experimentation with elements of disco and other styles.&lt;ref name=Reynolds/&gt; [[Public Image Limited]] is considered the first Post Punk group.&lt;ref name=Reynolds/&gt; The group's second album [[Metal Box]] fully embraced the studio as instrument methodology of disco.&lt;ref name=Reynolds/&gt; The group's founder [[John Lydon]] told the press that disco was the only music he cared for at the time. [[No Wave]] was a sub genre of post punk centered in New York City.&lt;ref name=Reynolds/&gt; For shock value, [[James Chance]] who was a notable member of the No Wave scene penned an article in the [[East Village Eye]] urging his readers to move uptown and get &quot;trancin' with some superadioactive disco voodoo funk&quot;. His band [[James White and the Blacks]] wrote a disco album [[Off White]].&lt;ref name=Reynolds/&gt; Their performances resembled those of disco performers (horn section, dancers and so on.).&lt;ref name=Reynolds/&gt; In 1981 [[ZE Records]] led the transition from No Wave into the more subtle [[Mutant disco]] ([[post-disco#DanceRock|post-disco/punk]]) genre.&lt;ref name=Reynolds/&gt; Mutant disco acts such as [[Kid Creole and the Coconuts]], [[Was Not Was]], [[ESG (band)|ESG]] and [[Liquid Liquid]] influenced several British Post Punk acts such as [[New Order]], [[Orange Juice]] and [[A Certain Ratio]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Reynolds&quot;&gt;Rip It Up and Start Again POSTPUNK 1978–1984 by [[Simon Reynolds]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nu-disco===
{{main|Nu-disco}}
Nu-disco is a 21st century dance music genre associated with the renewed interest in 1970s and early 1980s disco,&lt;ref name=&quot;reynolds2001&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Village Voice|title=Disco Double Take: New York Parties Like It's 1975|date=2001-07-11|accessdate=2008-12-17|last=Reynolds|first=Simon|url=http://energyflashbysimonreynolds.blogspot.com/2008/06/disco-double-take-new-york-parties-like.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; mid-1980s Italo disco, and the synthesizer-heavy Eurodisco aesthetics.&lt;ref name=&quot;spin200802&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Beta |first=Andy |coauthors= |year=2008 |month=February |title=Boogie Children: A new generation of DJs and producers revive the spaced-out, synthetic sound of Eurodisco |journal=Spin |page=44 |url=http://spin-cdnsrc.texterity.com/spin/200802/?pg=48 |accessdate=2008-08-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The moniker appeared in print as early as 2002, and by mid-2008 was used by record shops such as the online retailers Juno and Beatport.&lt;ref name=&quot;beatport&quot;&gt;{{cite press release

It is also used to describe the music on several American labels that were previously associated with the genres [[electroclash]] and [[deep house]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Donegal fiddle tradition''' is a type of [[Folk music of Ireland|Irish traditional music]], based on a two-hundred year-old tradition (or possibly set of coexisting traditions) of playing the [[Musical styles (violin)#Fiddle|fiddle]] in [[County Donegal]], [[Ireland]].&lt;ref name=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last = Vallely|first = Fintan|year = 1999|title= The Companion to Irish Traditional Music|publisher=Cork University Press|isbn=0-8147-8802-5|page=2|postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Donegal is a partly [[Irish language|Irish]]-speaking highland-county in northwestern Ireland and one of the three counties of the northern Irish province of [[Ulster]] that are part of the [[Republic of Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|title=Atlas of the Irish Rural Landscape (Hardcover)|author=F. H. A. Aalen et al.|date=1997-07-19|isbn=978-0802042941|publisher=University of Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tradition has several distinguishing traits, most of which involves styles of [[Bow (music)|bowing]] and the [[Ornament (music)|ornamentation]] of the music, as well as the [[rhythm]]. Another characteristic of the style is the rapid pace at which it tends to proceed.&lt;ref name=&quot;intro&quot;/&gt; Modern players, such as the fiddle group [[Altan (band)|Altan]], continue to be popular due to a variety of reasons.&lt;ref name=&quot;international&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=The Companion to Irish Traditional Music|author=Fintan Vallely|publisher=New York University Press|year=1999|isbn=0814788025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Paddy-moran.jpg|alt=Seated man playing a fiddle in a studio, wearing earphones.|right|thumb|[[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] fiddler Paddy Moran]]
Donegal styles has its roots in ancient Irish music styles, although the accent on the Donegal fiddle tradition is also somewhat related to the Scots tradition.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Between the Jigs and the Reels: The Donegal Fiddle Tradition C Mac Aoidh - 1994 - Drumlin Publications&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Donegal and Shetland Fiddle Music D McLaughlin, Irish Traditional Music Society - 1992 - Irish Traditional Music Society, University College, Cork&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;jrqigj&quot;&gt;Changing cultural landscapes: the co-existence of musical genres in Irish culture and education. M McCarthy - Irish Studies Review, 2004 - Taylor &amp; Francis&lt;/ref&gt; Like some Scottish fiddlers (who, like Donegal fiddlers, tend to use a short bow and play in a straight-ahead fashion), some Donegal fiddlers worked at imitating the sound of the [[bagpipes]]. Workers from Donegal would bring their music to Scotland and also bring back Scottish tunes with them such music of J. Scott Skinner and Mackenzie Murdoch.&lt;ref name=&quot;mustrad&quot;&gt;{{Cite document|unused_data=DUPLICATE DATA: publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|title=Changing cultural landscapes: the co-existence of musical genres in Irish culture and education|first=M.|last=McCarthy|publisher=Irish Studies Review|year=2004|page=134|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The historical connection between the west coast of Donegal and [[Scotland]] is an ancient one which was furthered by [[immigration]] from Donegal to Scotland in the 19th century&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indigo.ie/~donances/FrameSet3.html|title=Some Donegal Surnames|accessdate=2008-03-08|publisher=Donegal Ancestry}}&lt;/ref&gt; (the regions share common names of dances), as can be heard in the volume of strathspeys, [[schottische]]s, [[march (music)|marches]], and Donegal's own strong piping tradition, has influenced and been influenced by music, and by the sounds, ornaments, and repertoire of the [[Piob Mhor|Píob Mhór]], the traditional bagpipes of Ireland and Scotland.&lt;ref name=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.standingstones.com/donegalf.html|title=The Fiddle Music of Donegal|accessdate=2008-03-08|author=Michael Robinson|publisher=The Standing Stones}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are other differences between the Donegal style and the rest of Ireland. Instruments such as the tin whistle, flute, concertina and accordion were very rare in Donegal until modern times.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; Traditionally the píob mór and the fiddle were the only instruments used and the use of pipe or fiddle music was common in old wedding customs. Migrant workers carried their music to Scotland and also brought back a number of tunes of Scottish origin.&lt;ref name = &quot;jrqigj&quot;/&gt; The Donegal fiddlers may well have been the route by which Scottish tunes such as Lucy Campbell, Tarbolton Lodge (Tarbolton) and The Flagon (The Flogging Reel), that entered the Irish repertoire.&lt;ref name = &quot;jrqigj&quot;/&gt; These players prided themselves on their technical abilities, which included playing in higher positions (fairly uncommon among traditional Irish fiddlers), and sought out material which would demonstrate their skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishfiddle.com/mcguireinterview.html|title=Sean McGuire: Master of The Irish Violin|accessdate=2008-03-08|author=Ken Perlman|publisher=The Irish Fiddle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description of style==
[[File:Donegalfiddle.PNG|thumb|left|An example of the described musical styles.]]
The Donegal style of fiddling is a label often applied to music from this area, though one also might plausibly identify several different, but related, styles within the county.&lt;ref name=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.standingstones.com/donegalf.html|title=The Fiddle Music of Donegal|author=Michael Robinson|publisher=The Standing Stones|accessdate=2008-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; To the extent to which there is one common style in the county, it is characterized by a rapid pace; a tendency to be more un-[[Swung note|swung]] in the playing of the fast dance tune types ([[reel (dance)|reel]] and [[jig]]s); short (non-[[Slur (music)|slurred]]), aggressive bowing, sparse ornamentation, the use of bowed [[Tuplet|triplets]] more often than [[Trill consonant|trills]] as [[musical ornament|ornaments]], the use of [[double stop]]s and droning; and the occurrence of &quot;playing the octave&quot;, with one player playing the melody and the other playing the melody an octave lower. None of these characteristics is universal, and there is some disagreement as to the extent to which there is a common style at all. In general, however, the style is rather aggressive.&lt;ref name=&quot;intro&quot;/&gt;

Another feature of Donegal fiddling that makes it distinctive among Irish musical traditions is the variety of rare tune types that are played. Highlands, a type of tune in [[4/4 time]] with some similarities to Scottish [[strathspey (dance)|strathspeys]], which are also played in Donegal, are one of the most commonly played types of tune in the county. Other tune types common solely in the county include barndances, also called &quot;Germans,&quot; and [[mazurka]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;ma&quot; /&gt;

==Fiddlers of the Donegal tradition==
===Historical===
[[File:Donegalmap.jpg|alt=Map of County Donegal showing mountainous regions and lowlands adjacent to the water.|right|thumb|Map showing the geography and some of the different regions of Donegal.]]There are a number of different strands to the history of fiddle playing in County Donegal.&lt;ref name=&quot;ma&quot;&gt;{{Cite document|title=Between the Jigs and the Reels: The Donegal Fiddle Tradition|first=C. |last=MacAoidh|year=1994|publisher=Drumlin Publications|page=125|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the best-known and, in the last half of the twentieth century, the most influential has been that of the Doherty family.&lt;ref name=&quot;mustrad&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiddlesessions.com/oct06/mccarrick.html|title=Famous Fiddlers, General Knowledge and Where to Get It Part Three|accessdate=2008-03-08|author=Tim McCarrick|publisher=Mel Bay Publications, Inc.}} {{dead link| date=June 2010 | bot=DASHBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hugh Doherty (musician)|Hugh Doherty]] is the first known musician of this family. Born in 1790, he headed an unbroken tradition of fiddlers and pipers in the Doherty family until the death, in 1980, of perhaps the best-known Donegal fiddler, [[John Doherty (musician)|John Doherty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Johnny Doherty|url=http://www.iol.ie/~ronolan/doherty.html|accessdate=2008-03-08|publisher=Rambling House|date=2007-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; John, a travelling tinsmith, was known for his extremely precise and fast finger- and bow-work and vast repertoire, and is considered to be one of the greatest Irish fiddlers ever recorded.&lt;ref name=&quot;mustrad&quot;/&gt; John's older brother, Mickey, was also recorded and, though Mickey was another of the great Irish fiddlers, his reputation has been overshadowed by John's.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document|title=Donegal and Shetland Fiddle Music|first=D.|last=McLaughlin|publisher=Irish Traditional Music Society|year=1992|city=Cork|page=58|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no single Donegal style but several distinctive styles. These styles traditionally come from the geographical isolated regions of Donegal including [[Inishowen]], eastern Donegal, [[The Rosses]] and [[Gweedore]], [[Croaghs]], [[Teelin]], [[Kilcar]], [[Glencolmcille]], [[Ballyshannon]] and [[Bundoran]]. Even with improved communications and transport, these regions still have recognisably different ways of fiddle playing. Notable deceased players of the older Donegal styles include Neillidh (&quot;Neilly&quot;) Boyle, Francie Byrne, Con Cassidy, and Frank Cassidy. Currently living Donegal fiddlers, include [[James Byrne (musician)|James Byrne]], [[Vincent Campbell]], [[John Gallagher (fiddler)|John Gallagher]], [[Paddy Glackin]], [[Danny O'Donnell (fiddler)|Danny O'Donnell]], and [[Tommy Peoples]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ma&quot; /&gt;

===Modern===
Fiddle playing continues to be popular in Donegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.efxstudio.com/studio/Music%20Articles/encyclopedic/donegal_fiddle.htm|title=The Donegal Fiddle Tradition|accessdate=2008-03-08|author=Larry Sanger|publisher=EFX Studio}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three fiddlers of the Donegal &quot;supergroup&quot; [[Altan (band)|Altan]], [[Mairéad Ní Mhaonaigh]], [[Paul O'Shaughnessy]], [[Dinny McLaughlin]], and [[Ciarán Tourish]], are generally admired within Donegal.&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, Allen, and Eamonn O'Doherty.

The fiddle, and traditional music in general, remained popular in Donegal not only because of the international coverage of certain artists&lt;ref name=&quot;international&quot;/&gt; but because of local pride in the music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dun-na-ngall.com/nw76.html|title=Nuacht Vol. 8 No.4|publisher=County Donegal|accessdate=2008-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional music ''[[Irish traditional music session|Seisiúns]]'' are still common place both in [[pubs]] and in houses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document|title=Field Guide to the Irish Music Session (Hardcover)|last=Foy|first=Barry|year=1999|month=March|isbn=978-1570982415|publisher=Roberts Rinehart Publishers|page=89|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Donegal fiddle music has been influenced by [[Sound recording and reproduction|recorded music]], but this is claimed to have had a positive impact on the tradition.&lt;ref name=&quot;imr&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishmusicreview.com/donegalfiddle.htm|title=The Donegal Fiddle|accessdate=2008-01-29|publisher=Irish Music Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern Donegal fiddle music is often played in concerts and recorded on albums.&lt;ref name=&quot;imr&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiddle.com/issues/sum06.html|accessdate=2008-03-08|title=Summer 2006|publisher=Fiddler Magazine|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080615214458/http://www.fiddle.com/issues/sum06.html |archivedate = June 15, 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">:''&quot;Double barrel&quot; redirects here. For the song by Dave and Ansell Collins, see [[Double Barrel]].''

[[Image:ShotgunAction.JPG|thumb|A view of the break-action of a typical side-by-side double-barrelled shotgun, with the [[Anson &amp; Deeley boxlock action]] open and the extractor visible. The opening lever and the [[Safety (firearms)|safety catch]] can also be clearly seen.]]

A '''double-barreled shotgun''' is a [[shotgun]] or [[combination gun]] with two parallel barrels, allowing two shots to be fired in quick succession.

==Construction==
Double-barreled shotguns, often known as ''doubles'', are almost universally [[break open]] actions, with the barrels tilting up at the rear to expose the breech ends of the barrels for unloading and reloading.  Since there is no reciprocating action needed to eject and reload the [[shotgun shell|shells]], doubles are more compact than repeating designs such as [[pump action shotgun|pump action]] or [[Semi-automatic shotgun|semi-automatic]] shotguns. 
===Barrel configuration===
{{seealso|coach gun|sawed-off shotgun}}
Doubles come in two basic configurations, the ''side by side'' or ''SxS'' and the ''over/under'' or ''O/U'', indicating the arrangement of barrels.  The original double barreled guns were nearly all SxS designs, which was a more practical design in the days of [[muzzle-loading]] [[firearm]]s.  Early [[cartridge (firearms)|cartridge]] shotguns also used the SxS action, because they kept the exposed hammers of the earlier muzzle-loading shotguns they evolved from.  When [[hammerless]] designs started to become common, the O/U design was introduced, and most modern sporting doubles are O/U designs

One significant advantage that doubles have over single barrel repeating shotguns is the ability to use more than one choke at a time.  Some shotgun sports, such as [[Skeet shooting|skeet]], use crossing targets presented in a narrow range of distance, and only require one level of choke. Others, like [[sporting clays]], give the shooter targets at differing ranges, and targets that might approach or recede from the shooter, and so must be engaged at differing ranges.  Having two barrels lets the shooter use a more open choke for near targets, and a tighter choke for distant targets, providing the optimal shot pattern for each distance.

Their disadvantage lies in the fact that the barrels of a double barreled shotgun, whether  ''O/U'' or ''SxS'', are not parallel, but, slightly angled so that shots from the barrels converge, usually at &quot;40 yards out&quot;. For the ''SxS'' configuration, the shotstring continues on its path to the opposite side of the rib after the converging point; for example, the left barrel's discharge travels on the left of the rib till it hits dead center at 40 yards out, after that, the discharge continues on to the right. In the ''O/U'' configuration with a parallel rib, both barrels' discharges will keep to the dead center, but the discharge from the &quot;under&quot; barrel will shoot higher than the discharge from the &quot;over&quot; barrel after 40 yards. Thus, double barrel shotguns are accurate only in very short ranges, though the range of their ammunition easily exceeds four to six times that range.

===Trigger mechanism===
The early doubles used two triggers, one for each barrel.  These were located front to back inside the trigger guard, the index finger being used to pull either trigger, as having two fingers inside the trigger guard can cause a recoil induced double-discharge.  In double trigger designs, it is often possible to pull both triggers at once, firing both barrels simultaneously, though this is generally not recommended as it doubles the recoil, battering both shooter and shotgun. Discharging both barrels at the same time has long been a hunting trick employed by hunters using 8 gauge &quot;elephant&quot; shotguns, firing the two two-ounce slugs for sheer stopping power at close range.

Later models used a single trigger that would alternately fire both barrels, called a ''single selective trigger'' or ''SST''.  The SST does not allow firing of both barrels at once, since it must be pulled twice in order to fire both barrels.  The change from one barrel to the other may be done by a [[clockwork]] type system, where a cam alternates between barrels, or by an [[inertia]]l system where the recoil of firing the first barrel selects the next barrel. Generally there is a method of selecting the order in which the barrels of an SST shotgun fire; commonly this is done through manipulation of the [[Safety (firearms)|safety]], pushing to one side to select top barrel first and the other side to select bottom barrel first.

One of the advantages of the double, with double triggers or SST, is that a second shot can be taken almost immediately after the first. Pump-action and semiautomatic guns require that the fired round be ejected and a new one be loaded, which takes time.  Even the few [[automatic shotgun|fully automatic]] shotguns which have been built, such as the [[USAS-12]] have cyclic rates that can be exceeded by a quick shooter with a double.

===Regulation===
'''''Regulation''''' is a term used for multi-barreled firearms that indicates how close to the same point of aim the barrels will shoot.  Regulation is very important, because a poorly regulated gun may hit consistently with one barrel, but miss consistently with the other, making the gun nearly useless for anything requiring two shots.  Fortunately, the short ranges and spread of shot provide a significant overlap, so a small error in regulation in a double will often be too small to be noticed.  Generally the shotguns are regulated to hit the point of aim at a given distance, usually the maximum expected range since that is the range at which a full choke would be used, and where precise regulation matters most.

==Regional use==
The double-barreled shotgun is seen as a weapon of prestige in rural parts of [[North India]], where it is seen as a weapon of authority and is known as 'a dunali', literally meaning &quot;two pipes&quot;. It is especially common in [[Bihar]], [[Purvanchal]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[Haryana]] and [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]].{{fact|date=August 2009}}

{{distinguish|desert}}

In [[Western culture]], '''dessert''' is a course that typically comes at the end of a meal, usually consisting of sweet [[food]]. The word comes from the French language as ''dessert'' and this from [[Old French]] ''desservir'', &quot;to clear the table&quot; and &quot;to serve.&quot; Common desserts include [[cake]]s, [[cookie]]s, [[Gelatin dessert|gelatin]],  [[pastry|pastries]], [[ice cream]], [[pie]], and [[candy|candies]].  [[Fruit]] may also be eaten with the dessert. 
In Russia, breakfast foods such as Bliny, Oladi, and Syrniki served with honey and jam are also popular as desserts.

The word ''dessert'' is most commonly used for this course in [[American English|U.S.]], [[Canadian English|Canada]], [[Australian English|Australia]], New Zealand and [[Hiberno-English|Ireland]], while '''sweet''', [[pudding]] or '''afters''' may be alternative terms used in the [[British English|UK]] and some other Commonwealth countries, including [[India]]. In England, the term ''pudding'' is usually used among the Upper and Upper-middle classes, with ''dessert'' only used if the course consists of fruit or sweetmeats, after the cheese and biscuits course (See [[U and non-U English]]).
 
Desserts are often eaten with a [[dessert spoon]], intermediate in size between a [[teaspoon]] and a [[tablespoon]].

Elimination of dessert foods may be a strategy used in [[dieting]], in order to reduce the amount of calories, carbohydrates, or fat consumed.

==History==
The first desserts were candies, made from raw honeycomb and dried dates. It was not until the Middle Ages, when sugar was manufactured, that people began to enjoy more sweets but even then sugar was so expensive that it was only for the wealthy on special occasions.&lt;ref&gt;http://gourmet.lovetoknow.com/History_of_Desserts&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Data Encryption Standard''' ('''DES''') is a [[block cipher]] that uses [[shared secret]] [[encrypt]]ion. It was selected by the [[National Bureau of Standards]] as an official [[Federal Information Processing Standard]] (FIPS) for the [[United States]] in 1976 and which has subsequently enjoyed widespread use internationally. It is based on a [[symmetric-key algorithm]] that uses a 56-bit key. The [[algorithm]] was initially controversial because of [[classified information|classified]] design elements, a relatively short [[key length]], and suspicions about a [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) [[backdoor (computing)|backdoor]]. DES consequently came under intense academic scrutiny which motivated the modern understanding of [[block cipher]]s and their [[cryptanalysis]].

DES is now considered to be insecure for many applications. This is chiefly due to the 56-bit key size being too small; in January, 1999, [[distributed.net]] and the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] collaborated to publicly break a DES key in 22 hours and 15 minutes (see [[Data Encryption Standard#Chronology|chronology]]). There are also some analytical results which demonstrate theoretical weaknesses in the cipher, although they are infeasible to mount in practice. The algorithm is believed to be practically secure in the form of [[Triple DES]], although there are theoretical attacks. In recent years, the cipher has been superseded by the [[Advanced Encryption Standard]] (AES). Furthermore, DES has been withdrawn as a standard by the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (formerly the National Bureau of Standards).

In some documentation, a distinction is made between DES as a standard and DES the algorithm which is referred to as the '''DEA''' (the '''Data Encryption Algorithm'''). When spoken, &quot;DES&quot; is either spelled out as an [[abbreviation]] ({{IPA-en|ˌdiːˌiːˈɛs|}}), or pronounced as a one-syllable [[acronym]] ({{IPA-en|ˈdɛz|}}).

== History of DES ==
The origins of DES go back to the early 1970s. In 1972, after concluding a study on the US government's [[computer security]] needs, the US standards body NBS (National Bureau of Standards)&amp;nbsp;— now named [[NIST]] (National Institute of Standards and Technology)&amp;nbsp;— identified a need for a government-wide standard for encrypting unclassified, sensitive information.&lt;ref&gt;It created by IBM (International Business machine ){{cite conference|author=Walter Tuchman|title=A brief history of the data encryption standard|booktitle=Internet besieged: countering cyberspace scofflaws|publisher=	
ACM Press/Addison-Wesley Publishing Co. New York, NY, USA|pages=275–280|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, on 15 May 1973, after consulting with the NSA, NBS solicited proposals for a cipher that would meet rigorous design criteria. None of the submissions, however, turned out to be suitable. A second request was issued on 27 August 1974. This time, [[International Business Machines|IBM]] submitted a candidate which was deemed acceptable&amp;nbsp;— a cipher developed during the period 1973–1974 based on an earlier algorithm, [[Horst Feistel]]'s [[Lucifer (cipher)|Lucifer]] cipher. The team at IBM involved in cipher design and analysis included Feistel, [[Walter Tuchman]], [[Don Coppersmith]], Alan Konheim, Carl Meyer, Mike Matyas, Roy Adler, [[Edna Grossman]], Bill Notz, Lynn Smith, and [[Bryant Tuckerman]].

=== NSA's involvement in the design ===
On 17 March 1975, the proposed DES was published in the ''[[Federal Register]]''. Public comments were requested, and in the following year two open workshops were held to discuss the proposed standard. There was some criticism from various parties, including from [[public-key cryptography]] pioneers [[Martin Hellman]] and [[Whitfield Diffie]], citing a shortened [[key length]] and the mysterious &quot;[[Substitution box|S-boxes]]&quot; as evidence of improper interference from the NSA. The suspicion was that the algorithm had been covertly weakened by the intelligence agency so that they&amp;nbsp;— but no-one else&amp;nbsp;— could easily read encrypted messages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsa.com/rsalabs/node.asp?id=2227|title=Has DES been broken?|author=RSA Laboratories|accessdate=2009-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alan Konheim (one of the designers of DES) commented, &quot;We sent the S-boxes off to Washington. They came back and were all different.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schneier|title=Applied Cryptography|edition=2nd|page=280}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence]] reviewed the NSA's actions to determine whether there had been any improper involvement. In the unclassified summary of their findings, published in 1978, the Committee wrote:
{{quote|In the development of DES, NSA convinced [[IBM]] that a reduced key size was sufficient; indirectly assisted in the development of the S-box structures; and certified that the final DES algorithm was, to the best of their knowledge, free from any statistical or mathematical weakness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=D.W.|last=Davies|coauthors=W.L. Price|title=Security for computer networks, 2nd ed.|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
However, it also found that
{{quote|NSA did not tamper with the design of the algorithm in any way. IBM invented and designed the algorithm, made all pertinent decisions regarding it, and concurred that the agreed upon key size was more than adequate for all commercial applications for which the DES was intended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Robert Sugarman (editor)|title=On foiling computer crime|journal=IEEE Spectrum|month=July | year=1979|publisher=[[IEEE]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Another member of the DES team, Walter Tuchman, stated &quot;We developed the DES algorithm entirely within IBM using IBMers. The NSA did not dictate a single wire!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=P. Kinnucan|title=Data Encryption Gurus: Tuchman and Meyer|journal=Cryptologia|volume=2|issue=4|month=October | year=1978|doi=10.1080/0161-117891853270|page=371}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In contrast, a declassified NSA book on cryptologic history states:
{{quote|In 1973 NBS solicited private industry for a data encryption standard (DES). The first offerings were disappointing, so NSA began working on its own algorithm. Then Howard Rosenblum, deputy director for research and engineering, discovered that Walter Tuchman of IBM was working on a modification to Lucifer for general use. NSA gave Tuchman a clearance and brought him in to work jointly with the Agency on his Lucifer modification.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Thomas R. Johnson|title=American Cryptology during the Cold War, 1945-1989.Book III: Retrenchment and Reform, 1972-1980|journal=United States Cryptologic History|volume=5|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
and
{{quote|NSA worked closely with IBM to strengthen the algorithm against all except brute force attacks and to strengthen substitution tables, called S-boxes. Conversely, NSA tried to convince IBM to reduce the length of the key from 64 to 48 bits. Ultimately they compromised on a 56-bit key.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cryptome.org/0001/nsa-meyer.htm|title=American Cryptology during the Cold War, 1945-1989.Book III: Retrenchment and Reform, 1972-1980, page 232 |author = Thomas R. Johnson| accessdate=2010-01-03 |publisher = [[NSA]], DOCID 3417193 (file released on 2009-12-18, hosted at cryptome.org)| date= 2009-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Some of the suspicions about hidden weaknesses in the S-boxes were allayed in 1990, with the independent discovery and open publication by [[Eli Biham]] and [[Adi Shamir]] of [[differential cryptanalysis]], a general method for breaking block ciphers. The S-boxes of DES were much more resistant to the attack than if they had been chosen at random, strongly suggesting that IBM knew about the technique in the 1970s. This was indeed the case; in 1994, Don Coppersmith published some of the original design criteria for the S-boxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Konheim|title=Computer Security and Cryptography|page=301}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Steven Levy]], IBM Watson researchers discovered differential cryptanalytic attacks in 1974 and were asked by the NSA to keep the technique secret.&lt;ref name=Levy&gt;Levy, ''Crypto'', p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; Coppersmith explains IBM's secrecy decision by saying, &quot;that was because [differential cryptanalysis] can be a very powerful tool, used against many schemes, and there was concern that such information in the public domain could adversely affect national security.&quot; Levy quotes Walter Tuchman: &quot;[t]hey asked us to stamp all our documents confidential... We actually put a number on each one and locked them up in safes, because they were considered U.S. government classified. They said do it. So I did it&quot;.&lt;ref name=Levy/&gt; Bruce Schneier observed that &quot;It took the academic community two decades to figure out that the NSA 'tweaks' actually improved the security of DES.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;schneier20040927&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Schneier|first=Bruce|title=Saluting the data encryption legacy|url=http://news.cnet.com/Saluting-the-data-encryption-legacy/2010-1029_3-5381232.html|accessdate=2010-10-28|newspaper=CNet|date=2004-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The algorithm as a standard ===
Despite the criticisms, DES was approved as a federal standard in November 1976, and published on 15 January 1977 as '''[[Federal Information Processing Standard|FIPS]] PUB 46''', authorized for use on all unclassified data. It was subsequently reaffirmed as the standard in 1983, 1988 (revised as '''FIPS-46-1'''), 1993 ('''FIPS-46-2'''), and again in 1999 ('''FIPS-46-3'''), the latter prescribing &quot;[[Triple DES]]&quot; (see below). On 26 May 2002, DES was finally superseded by the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), following [[Advanced Encryption Standard process|a public competition]]. On 19 May 2005, FIPS 46-3 was officially withdrawn, but [[NIST]] has approved [[Triple DES]] through the year 2030 for sensitive government information.&lt;ref name=SP800-67&gt;[[National Institute of Standards and Technology]], [http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-67/SP800-67.pdf NIST Special Publication 800-67 ''Recommendation for the Triple Data Encryption Algorithm (TDEA) Block Cipher'', Version 1.1]&lt;/ref&gt;

The algorithm is also specified in ANSI X3.92,&lt;ref&gt;[[American National Standards Institute]], ANSI X3.92-1981 ''American National Standard, Data Encryption Algorithm''&lt;/ref&gt; NIST SP 800-67&lt;ref name=SP800-67/&gt; and ISO/IEC 18033-3&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=37972 |title=ISO/IEC 18033-3:2005 Information technology&amp;nbsp;— Security techniques&amp;nbsp;— Encryption algorithms&amp;nbsp;— Part 3: Block ciphers |publisher=Iso.org |date=2008-10-15 |accessdate=2009-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; (as a component of [[TDEA]]).

Another theoretical attack, linear cryptanalysis, was published in 1994, but it was a [[brute force attack]] in 1998 that demonstrated that DES could be attacked very practically, and highlighted the need for a replacement algorithm. These and other methods of [[cryptanalysis]] are discussed in more detail later in the article.

The introduction of DES is considered to have been a catalyst for the academic study of cryptography, particularly of methods to crack block ciphers. According to a NIST retrospective about DES,
:The DES can be said to have &quot;jump started&quot; the nonmilitary study and development of encryption algorithms. In the 1970s there were very few cryptographers, except for those in military or intelligence organizations, and little academic study of cryptography. There are now many active academic cryptologists, mathematics departments with strong programs in cryptography, and commercial information security companies and consultants. A generation of cryptanalysts has cut its teeth analyzing (that is trying to &quot;crack&quot;) the DES algorithm. In the words of cryptographer [[Bruce Schneier]],&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Schneier, Applied Cryptography, Protocols, Algorithms, and Source Code in C, Second edition, John Wiley and Sons, New York (1996) p. 267&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;DES did more to galvanize the field of cryptanalysis than anything else. Now there was an algorithm to study.&quot; An astonishing share of the open literature in cryptography in the 1970s and 1980s dealt with the DES, and the DES is the standard against which every symmetric key algorithm since has been compared.&lt;ref&gt;William E. Burr, &quot;Data Encryption Standard&quot;, in NIST's anthology &quot;A Century of Excellence in Measurements, Standards, and Technology: A Chronicle of Selected NBS/NIST Publications, 1901–2000.

== Replacement algorithms ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2009}}
Concerns about security and the relatively slow operation of DES in [[software]] motivated researchers to propose a variety of alternative [[block cipher]] designs, which started to appear in the late 1980s and early 1990s: examples include [[RC5]], [[Blowfish (cipher)|Blowfish]], [[International Data Encryption Algorithm|IDEA]], [[NewDES]], [[SAFER]], [[CAST5]] and [[FEAL]]. Most of these designs kept the 64-bit block size of DES, and could act as a &quot;drop-in&quot; replacement, although they typically used a 64-bit or 128-bit key. In the [[USSR]] the [[GOST 28147-89]] algorithm was introduced, with a 64-bit block size and a 256-bit key, which was also used in [[Russia]] later.

DES itself can be adapted and reused in a more secure scheme. Many former DES users now use [[Triple DES]] (TDES) which was described and analysed by one of DES's patentees (see [[Federal Information Processing Standard|FIPS]] Pub 46-3); it involves applying DES three times with two (2TDES) or three (3TDES) different keys. TDES is regarded as adequately secure, although it is quite slow. A less computationally expensive alternative is [[DES-X]], which increases the key size by XORing extra key material before and after DES. [[GDES]] was a DES variant proposed as a way to speed up encryption, but it was shown to be susceptible to differential cryptanalysis.

In 2001, after an international competition, NIST selected a new cipher, the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), as a replacement. The algorithm which was selected as the AES was submitted by its designers under the name [[Rijndael]]. Other finalists in the NIST [[AES competition]] included [[RC6]], [[Serpent (cipher)|Serpent]], [[MARS (cryptography)|MARS]] and [[Twofish]].

:''For brevity, the following description omits the exact transformations and permutations which specify the algorithm; for reference, the details can be found in [[DES supplementary material]].''
DES is the archetypal [[block cipher]]&amp;nbsp;— an [[algorithm]] that takes a fixed-length string of [[plaintext]] bits and transforms it through a series of complicated operations into another [[ciphertext]] bitstring of the same length. In the case of DES, the [[block size (cryptography)|block size]] is 64 bits. DES also uses a [[key (cryptography)|key]] to customize the transformation, so that decryption can supposedly only be performed by those who know the particular key used to encrypt. The key ostensibly consists of 64 bits; however, only 56 of these are actually used by the algorithm. Eight bits are used solely for checking [[parity bit|parity]], and are thereafter discarded. Hence the effective [[key length]] is 56 bits, and it is never quoted as such. Every 8th bit of the selected key is discarded, that is, positions 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64 are removed from the 64 bit key leaving behind only the 56 bit key.

Like other block ciphers, DES by itself is not a secure means of encryption but must instead be used in a [[block cipher mode of operation|mode of operation]]. FIPS-81 specifies several modes for use with DES.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itl.nist.gov/fipspubs/fip81.htm |title=FIPS 81 - Des Modes of Operation |publisher=Itl.nist.gov |date= |accessdate=2009-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further comments on the usage of DES are contained in FIPS-74.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itl.nist.gov/fipspubs/fip74.htm |title=FIPS 74 - Guidelines for Implementing and Using the NBS Data |publisher=Itl.nist.gov |date= |accessdate=2009-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Overall structure ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2009}}
The algorithm's overall structure is shown in Figure 1: there are 16 identical stages of processing, termed ''rounds''. There is also an initial and final [[permutation]], termed ''IP'' and ''FP'', which are [[inverse (function)|inverses]] (IP &quot;undoes&quot; the action of FP, and vice versa). IP and FP have almost no cryptographic significance, but were apparently included in order to facilitate loading blocks in and out of mid-1970s hardware.

Before the main rounds, the block is divided into two 32-bit halves and processed alternately; this criss-crossing is known as the [[Feistel scheme]]. The Feistel structure ensures that decryption and encryption are very similar processes&amp;nbsp;— the only difference is that the subkeys are applied in the reverse order when decrypting. The rest of the algorithm is identical. This greatly simplifies implementation, particularly in hardware, as there is no need for separate encryption and decryption algorithms.

The ⊕ symbol denotes the [[XOR|exclusive-OR]] (XOR) operation. The ''F-function'' scrambles half a block together with some of the key. The output from the F-function is then combined with the other half of the block, and the halves are swapped before the next round. After the final round, the halves are not swapped; this is a feature of the Feistel structure which makes encryption and decryption similar processes.

=== The Feistel (F) function ===
The F-function, depicted in Figure 2, operates on half a block (32 bits) at a time and consists of four stages:

&lt;/imagemap&gt;
# ''Expansion''&amp;nbsp;— the 32-bit half-block is expanded to 48 bits using the ''expansion permutation'', denoted ''E'' in the diagram, by duplicating half of the bits. The output consists of eight 6-bit(8*6=48bits) pieces, each containing a copy of 4 corresponding input bits, plus a copy of the immediately adjacent bit from each of the input pieces to either side.
# ''Key mixing''&amp;nbsp;— the result is combined with a ''subkey'' using an XOR operation. 16 48-bit subkeys&amp;nbsp;— one for each round&amp;nbsp;— are derived from the main key using the ''[[key schedule]]'' (described below).
# ''Substitution''&amp;nbsp;— after mixing in the subkey, the block is divided into eight 6-bit pieces before processing by the ''[[Substitution box|S-boxes]]'', or ''substitution boxes''. Each of the eight S-boxes replaces its six input bits with four output bits according to a non-linear transformation, provided in the form of a [[lookup table]]. The S-boxes provide the core of the security of DES&amp;nbsp;— without them, the cipher would be linear, and trivially breakable.
# ''Permutation''&amp;nbsp;— finally, the 32 outputs from the S-boxes are rearranged according to a fixed [[permutation]], the ''P-box''. This is designed so that, after expansion, each S-box's output bits are spread across 6 different S boxes in the next round.

The alternation of substitution from the S-boxes, and permutation of bits from the P-box and E-expansion provides so-called &quot;[[confusion and diffusion]]&quot; respectively, a concept identified by [[Claude Shannon]] in the 1940s as a necessary condition for a secure yet practical cipher.

&lt;/imagemap&gt;
Figure 3 illustrates the ''key schedule'' for encryption &amp;nbsp;— the algorithm which generates the subkeys. Initially, 56 bits of the key are selected from the initial 64 by ''Permuted Choice 1'' (''PC-1'')&amp;nbsp;— the remaining eight bits are either discarded or used as [[parity bit|parity]] check bits. The 56 bits are then divided into two 28-bit halves; each half is thereafter treated separately. In successive rounds, both halves are rotated left by one or two bits (specified for each round), and then 48 subkey bits are selected by ''Permuted Choice 2'' (''PC-2'')&amp;nbsp;— 24 bits from the left half, and 24 from the right. The rotations (denoted by &quot;&lt;&lt;&lt;&quot; in the diagram) mean that a different set of bits is used in each subkey; each bit is used in approximately 14 out of the 16 subkeys.

The key schedule for decryption is similar&amp;nbsp;— the subkeys are in reverse order compared to encryption. Apart from that change, the process is the same as for encryption. The same 28 bits are passed to all rotation boxes.

== Security and cryptanalysis ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2009}}
Although more information has been published on the cryptanalysis of DES than any other block cipher, the most practical attack to date is still a brute force approach. Various minor cryptanalytic properties are known, and three theoretical attacks are possible which, while having a theoretical complexity less than a brute force attack, require an unrealistic number of [[known plaintext|known]] or [[chosen plaintext]]s to carry out, and are not a concern in practice.

=== Brute force attack ===
For any cipher, the most basic method of attack is [[brute force attack|brute force]]&amp;nbsp;— trying every possible key in turn. The [[key length|length of the key]] determines the number of possible keys, and hence the feasibility of this approach. For DES, questions were raised about the adequacy of its key size early on, even before it was adopted as a standard, and it was the small key size, rather than theoretical cryptanalysis, which dictated a need for a replacement algorithm. As a result of discussions involving external consultants including the NSA, the key size was reduced from 128 bits to 56 bits to fit on a single chip.&lt;ref name=&quot;stallings-2006&quot;&gt;Stallings, W. ''Cryptography and network security: principles and practice''. Prentice Hall, 2006. p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Board300.jpg|thumb|The [[Electronic Frontier Foundation|EFF]]'s US$250,000 [[EFF DES cracker|DES cracking machine]] contained 1,856 custom chips and could brute force a DES key in a matter of days&amp;nbsp;— the photo shows a DES Cracker circuit board fitted with several Deep Crack chips.]]

In academia, various proposals for a DES-cracking machine were advanced. In 1977, Diffie and Hellman proposed a machine costing an estimated US$20 million which could find a DES key in a single day. By 1993, Wiener had proposed a key-search machine costing US$1 million which would find a key within 7 hours. However, none of these early proposals were ever implemented—or, at least, no implementations were publicly acknowledged. The vulnerability of DES was practically demonstrated in the late 1990s. In 1997, [[RSA Security]] sponsored a series of contests, offering a $10,000 prize to the first team that broke a message encrypted with DES for the contest. That contest was won by the [[DESCHALL Project]], led by Rocke Verser, [[Matt Curtin]], and Justin Dolske, using idle cycles of thousands of computers across the Internet. The feasibility of cracking DES quickly was demonstrated in 1998 when a custom DES-cracker was built by the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] (EFF), a cyberspace civil rights group, at the cost of approximately US$250,000 (see [[EFF DES cracker]]). Their motivation was to show that DES was breakable in practice as well as in theory: &quot;''There are many people who will not believe a truth until they can see it with their own eyes. Showing them a physical machine that can crack DES in a few days is the only way to convince some people that they really cannot trust their security to DES.''&quot; The machine brute-forced a key in a little more than 2 days search.

The next confirmed DES cracker was the COPACOBANA machine built in 2006 by teams of the [[Ruhr University|Universities of Bochum]] and [[University of Kiel|Kiel]], both in [[Germany]]. Unlike the EFF machine, COPACOBANA consists of commercially available, reconfigurable integrated circuits. 120 of these [[Field-programmable gate array]]s (FPGAs) of type XILINX Spartan3-1000 run in parallel. They are grouped in 20 DIMM modules, each containing 6 FPGAs. The use of reconfigurable hardware makes the machine applicable to other code breaking tasks as well. One of the more interesting aspects of COPACOBANA is its cost factor. One machine can be built for approximately $10,000. The cost decrease by roughly a factor of 25 over the EFF machine is an impressive example for the continuous improvement of [[digital hardware]]. Adjusting for inflation over 8 years yields an even higher improvement of about 30x. Since 2007, SciEngines GmbH, a spin-off company of the two project partners of COPACOBANA has enhanced and developed successors of COPACOBANA. In 2008 their COPACOBANA RIVYERA reduced the time to break DES to less than one day, using 128 Spartan-3 5000's. Currently SciEngines RIVYERA holds the record in brute-force breaking DES utilizing 128 Spartan-3 5000 FPGAs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciengines.com/company/news-a-events/74-des-in-1-day.html Break DES in less than a single day] [Press release of Firm, demonstrated on 2009 Workshop]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Attacks faster than brute-force ===
There are three attacks known that can break the full 16 rounds of DES with less complexity than a brute-force search: [[differential cryptanalysis]] (DC), linear cryptanalysis (LC), and [[Davies' attack]]. However, the attacks are theoretical and are unfeasible to mount in practice{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}; these types of attack are sometimes termed certificational weaknesses.

* [[Differential cryptanalysis]] was rediscovered in the late 1980s by [[Eli Biham]] and [[Adi Shamir]]; it was known earlier to both IBM and the NSA and kept secret. To break the full 16 rounds, differential cryptanalysis requires 2&lt;sup&gt;47&lt;/sup&gt; [[chosen plaintext]]s.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} DES was designed to be resistant to DC.
* [[Linear cryptanalysis]] was discovered by [[Mitsuru Matsui]], and needs 2&lt;sup&gt;43&lt;/sup&gt; [[known plaintext]]s (Matsui, 1993); the method was implemented (Matsui, 1994), and was the first experimental cryptanalysis of DES to be reported. There is no evidence that DES was tailored to be resistant to this type of attack. A generalization of LC&amp;nbsp;— ''multiple linear cryptanalysis''&amp;nbsp;— was suggested in 1994 (Kaliski and Robshaw), and was further refined by Biryukov and others. (2004); their analysis suggests that multiple linear approximations could be used to reduce the data requirements of the attack by at least a factor of 4 (that is, 2&lt;sup&gt;41&lt;/sup&gt; instead of 2&lt;sup&gt;43&lt;/sup&gt;). A similar reduction in data complexity can be obtained in a chosen-plaintext variant of linear cryptanalysis (Knudsen and Mathiassen, 2000). Junod (2001) performed several experiments to determine the actual time complexity of linear cryptanalysis, and reported that it was somewhat faster than predicted, requiring time equivalent to 2&lt;sup&gt;39&lt;/sup&gt;–2&lt;sup&gt;41&lt;/sup&gt; DES evaluations.
* ''Improved Davies' attack'': while linear and differential cryptanalysis are general techniques and can be applied to a number of schemes, Davies' attack is a specialized technique for DES, first suggested by [[Donald Davies]] in the eighties, and improved by Biham and [[Alex Biryukov|Biryukov]] (1997). The most powerful form of the attack requires 2&lt;sup&gt;50&lt;/sup&gt; [[known plaintext]]s, has a computational complexity of 2&lt;sup&gt;50&lt;/sup&gt;, and has a 51% success rate.

There have also been attacks proposed against reduced-round versions of the cipher, that is, versions of DES with fewer than 16 rounds. Such analysis gives an insight into how many rounds are needed for safety, and how much of a &quot;security margin&quot; the full version retains. [[Differential-linear cryptanalysis]] was proposed by Langford and Hellman in 1994, and combines differential and linear cryptanalysis into a single attack. An enhanced version of the attack can break 9-round DES with 2&lt;sup&gt;15.8&lt;/sup&gt; known plaintexts and has a 2&lt;sup&gt;29.2&lt;/sup&gt; time complexity (Biham and others., 2002).

=== Minor cryptanalytic properties ===
DES exhibits the complementation property, namely that
:&lt;math&gt;E_K(P)=C \Leftrightarrow E_\overline{K}(\overline{P})=\overline{C}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\overline{x}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[bitwise complement]] of &lt;math&gt;x.&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;E_K&lt;/math&gt; denotes encryption with key &lt;math&gt;K.&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; denote plaintext and ciphertext blocks respectively. The complementation property means that the work for a [[brute force attack]] could be reduced by a factor of 2 (or a single bit) under a [[chosen-plaintext attack|chosen-plaintext]] assumption.

DES also has four so-called ''[[Weak key#Weak_keys_in_DES|weak keys]]''. Encryption (''E'') and decryption (''D'') under a weak key have the same effect (see [[involution (mathematics)|involution]]):
:&lt;math&gt;E_K(E_K(P)) = P&lt;/math&gt; or equivalently, &lt;math&gt;E_K = D_K&lt;/math&gt;
There are also six pairs of ''semi-weak keys''. Encryption with one of the pair of semiweak keys, &lt;math&gt;K_1&lt;/math&gt;, operates identically to decryption with the other, &lt;math&gt;K_2&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;E_{K_1}(E_{K_2}(P)) = P&lt;/math&gt; or equivalently, &lt;math&gt;E_{K_2} = D_{K_1}.&lt;/math&gt;
It is easy enough to avoid the weak and semiweak keys in an implementation, either by testing for them explicitly, or simply by choosing keys randomly; the odds of picking a weak or semiweak key by chance are negligible. The keys are not really any weaker than any other keys anyway, as they do not give an attack any advantage.

DES has also been proved not to be a [[group (mathematics)|group]], or more precisely, the set &lt;math&gt;\{E_K\}&lt;/math&gt; (for all possible keys &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;) under [[functional composition]] is not a group, nor &quot;close&quot; to being a group (Campbell and Wiener, 1992). This was an open question for some time, and if it had been the case, it would have been possible to break DES, and multiple encryption modes such as [[Triple DES]] would not increase the security.

It is known that the maximum cryptographic security of DES is limited to about 64 bits, even when independently choosing all round subkeys instead of deriving them from a key, which would otherwise permit a security of 768 bits.

[[Image:FountainSoda.jpg|thumb|upright=.7|A [[carbonated]] beverage.]]
A '''drink''', or '''beverage''', is a [[liquid]] which is specifically prepared for [[human]] consumption. In addition to filling a basic human need, beverages form part of the [[culture]] of [[human society]].

==Water==
{{Main|Drinking water}}
Despite the fact that all beverages contain [[water]], water itself is not classed as a beverage. The word ''[[wikt:beverage|beverage]]'' has traditionally been defined as not referring to water.

==Alcoholic beverages==
{{Main|Alcoholic beverage}}
An alcoholic beverage is a drink that contains [[ethanol]], commonly known as [[alcohol]] (although in [[chemistry]] the definition of &quot;alcohol&quot; includes many other compounds).

[[Beer]] has been a part of human culture for 8,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Origin and History of Beer and Brewing: From Prehistoric Times to the Beginning of Brewing Science and Technology |last=Arnold |first=John P |year=2005 |edition=Reprint |publisher=BeerBooks.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Germany]], [[Ireland]], the [[United Kingdom]], and many other European countries, drinking beer (and other [[alcoholic beverage]]s) in a local [[Bar (establishment)|bar]] or [[pub]] is a cultural tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Drinking Life: A Memoir |last=Hamill |first=Pete |year=1994 |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Asian countries (e.g., [[Sri Lanka]] and [[India]]) produce several varieties of alcoholic beverages (e.g., [[palm wine]]).

==Non-alcoholic beverages==
{{Main|Non-alcoholic beverage}}
A non-alcoholic beverage is one that contains little or no [[Ethanol|alcohol]]. This category includes [[low-alcohol beer]], non-alcoholic [[wine]], and [[apple cider]] if they contain less than 0.5% [[alcohol by volume]].

==Soft drinks==
{{Main|Soft drink}}
The term &quot;soft drink&quot; specifies the absence of alcohol in contrast to &quot;hard drink&quot; and &quot;drink&quot;. &quot;Drink&quot; is nominally neutral but often connotes alcoholic content.

Beverages such as soda pop, [[sparkling water]], [[iced tea]], [[lemonade]], [[squash (drink)|squash]], and [[fruit punch]] are the most common soft drinks. Milk, hot chocolate, tea, coffee, milkshakes, and tap water are not considered to be soft drinks.

Some carbonated soft drinks are available in versions that are sweetened with a [[sugar substitute]].

==Fruit juice==
[[Image:Oranges and orange juice.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Orange (fruit)|Orange]] [[juice]] is usually served cold.]]
[[Fruit]] juice is a natural product that contains few additives, or none. Citrus products such as [[orange juice]] and [[tangerine]] juice are very familiar breakfast beverages. [[Grapefruit juice]], pineapple, apple, grape, lime, and lemon juice are also familiar products. [[Coconut water]] is a highly nutritious and refreshing juice.

Many kinds of berries are crushed and their juices mixed with water and sometimes sweetened. Raspberry, blackberry and currants are often popular juices drinks but the percentage of water also determines their nutritive value. Juices were probably humankind's earliest drinks besides water. Grapes juice that was allowed to ferment produced the alcoholic drink [[wine]].

Fruits are highly perishable and so the ability to create juices and store them was of significant value. Some fruits are highly acidic and mixing them with additional water and sugars or honey was often necessary to make them palatable. Early storage of fruit juices was labor intensive, requiring the crushing of the fruits and the mixing of the resulting pure juices with sugars before bottling and capping them.

Orange juice and coconut water remain by far the most highly consumed juices on the market and are there because of their valuable nutrients and hydration abilities.

==Hot beverages==
[[Image:A small cup of coffee.JPG|thumb|A cup of [[coffee]].]]
A hot beverage is any beverage which is normally served heated. This may be through the addition of a heated liquid, such as water or milk, or by directly heating the beverage itself. Some examples of hot beverages are:
* [[Coffee]]-based beverages
** [[Café au lait]]
** [[Cappuccino]]
** [[Coffee]]
** [[Espresso]]
** [[Greek frappe coffee|Frappé]]
** Flavored [[coffee]]s ([[Cafe mocha|mocha]] etc.)
** [[Latte]]
* [[Hot chocolate]]
* [[Horlicks]]
* [[cider|Hot cider]]
** Mulled [[cider]]
* [[Glühwein]]
* [[Tea]]-based beverages
** Flavored [[tea]]s ([[chai]] etc.)
** [[Green tea]]
** [[Pearl milk tea]]
** [[Tea]]
* [[Herbal tea]]s
** [[Yerba Mate]]
* [[Roasted grain beverage]]s
** [[Sanka]]

==Miscellaneous==
[[Image:Masala Buttermilk.JPG|thumb|right|250px|[[Masala]] [[buttermilk]].]]
Some substances may be called either food or drink, and accordingly may be eaten with a [[spoon]] or drunk, depending upon their thickness and solutes.
* [[Buttermilk]]
* [[Soup]]
* [[Yogurt]]

'''Dill''' (''Anethum graveolens'') is a [[perennial plant|perennial]] [[herbaceous|herb]]. It is the sole species of the genus ''Anethum'', though classified by some botanists in a related genus as ''Peucedanum graveolens'' (L.) C.B.Clarke.

==Growth==

{{convert|40|-|60|cm|in|abbr=on|lk=off}}, with slender stems and alternate, finely divided, softly delicate [[leaf|leaves]] {{convert|10|-|20|cm|in|abbr=on|lk=off}} long. The ultimate leaf divisions are {{convert|1|-|2|mm|in|abbr=on|lk=off}} broad, slightly broader than the similar leaves of [[fennel]], which are threadlike, less than {{convert|1|mm|in|abbr=on}} broad, but harder in texture. The [[flower]]s are white to yellow, in small [[umbel]]s {{convert|2|-|9|cm|in|abbr=on|lk=off}} diameter. The [[seed]]s are {{convert|4|-|5|mm|in|abbr=on|lk=off}} long and {{convert|1|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick, and straight to slightly curved with a longitudinally ridged surface.

==Origins and history==
[[Image:Dill dried umbel.jpg|left|thumb|130px|Dried dill umbel]]
Dill originated in Eastern Europe {{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}. Zohary and Hopf remark that &quot;wild and weedy types of dill are widespread in the Mediterranean basin and in West Asia.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Zohary and Hopf, page 206.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although several twigs of dill were found in the tomb of [[Amenhotep II]], they report that the earliest archeological evidence for its cultivation comes from late [[Neolithic]] lake shore settlements in Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Domestication of plants in the Old World |last=Zohary |first=Daniel |authorlink= |coauthors=Hopf, Maria |year=2000 |edition=3rd |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=0198503571 |pages=206 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Traces have been found in [[Roman Empire|Roman]] ruins in [[Great Britain]].

In [[Semitic languages]] it is known by the name of '''Shubit'''. In Marathi, it is known as ''shepu'' The [[Talmud]] requires that [[tithe]]s shall be paid on the seeds, leaves, and stem of dill.

==Nomenclature and taxonomy==
The name ''dill'' comes from Old English ''dile'', thought to have originated from a Norse or Anglo-Saxon word ''dylle'' meaning to soothe or lull {{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}, the plant having the [[carminative]] property of relieving gas. In Sanskrit, this herb is called Shatapushpa. In Gujrati it is called  as hariz.
{{Expand section|date=July 2009}}

==Uses==
Fresh and dried dill leaves (sometimes called &quot;dill weed&quot; to distinguish it from dill seed) are used as [[herb]]s, mainly in Sweden, the Baltic, in Russia, and in central Asia.

Like [[caraway]], its fernlike leaves are aromatic and are used to flavor many [[food]]s, such as [[gravlax]] (cured [[salmon]]), [[borscht]] and other [[soup]]s, and [[Pickled cucumber|pickle]]s (where the dill flower is sometimes used).  Dill is best when used fresh, as it loses its flavor rapidly if dried; however, [[Freeze drying|freeze-dried]] dill leaves preserve their flavor relatively well for a few months.

Dill seed is used as a [[spice]], with a flavor somewhat similar to caraway but also resembling that of fresh or dried dill weed.  Dill seeds were traditionally used to soothe the stomach after meals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whfoods.com/genpage.php?tname=foodspice&amp;dbid=71#historyuse Whole Foods Profile]&lt;/ref&gt; And, [[dill oil]] can be extracted from the leaves, stems and seeds of the plant.

In Arabic, dill seed is called ''ain jaradeh'' (means cricket eye) used as a spice in cold dishes like [[fattosh]] and pickles. In [[Lao cuisine]] and parts of northern [[Isan|Thailand]] and [[Vietnam]], dill is known in English as '''Laotian coriander'''&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, A. (2003). [http://books.google.com/books?id=8nhfSFs79fUC&amp;pg=PA216&amp;lpg=PA216&amp;dq=laotian+coriander&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=HChuB7GgBB&amp;sig=90upJ_JfrC4HWGuG10Z0LQZgnWg&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=E457SoDIDZKmNoOR1JwE&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6#v=onepage&amp;q=laotian%20coriander&amp;f=false Seafood of South-East Asia], 2nd edition. Ten Speed Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and '''Lao cilantro''' ({{lang-lo|ຜັກຊີ}}, {{lang-th|ผักชีลาว}}, {{lang-vi|Thì là}}).  In the [[Lao language]], it is called ''Phak See'', and in [[Thai language|Thai]], it is known as ''Phak Chee Lao''.&lt;ref&gt;Ling, K. F. (2002). [http://books.google.com/books?id=oNPaeFOk7ykC&amp;pg=RA1-PA155&amp;lpg=RA1-PA155&amp;dq=laotian+coriander&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=UFOCMyobhe&amp;sig=v78Ob8F1lvxhuusIL13j2pp-jvM&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=UZB7Sv2kNpKmNpSR1JwE&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2#v=onepage&amp;q=laotian%20coriander&amp;f=false The Food of Asia]. Periplus Editions.&lt;/ref&gt;  In Lao cuisine, the herb is typically used in [[mok pa]] (steamed fish in banana leaf) and several coconut milk-based curries that contain fish or [[prawn]]s.  Lao coriander is also an essential ingredient in [[Vietnamese cuisine|Vietnamese]] dishes like [[chả cá]] and ''canh cá thì là''.

In Iran, dill is known as &quot;Shevid&quot; and is sometimes used with rice and called &quot;Shevid-Polo&quot;. In India, dill is known as 'Savaa' in Hindi or 'Soa' not related to Soy, in Punjabi. In Telugu it is called soya and soya-kura (for herb greens). It is also called 'sapsige soppu' (ಸಪ್ಸಿಗೆ ಸೊಪ್ಪು) in [[Kannada]].

In Gujarat, India, dill is prepared in the manner of yellow Moong dal as a main-course dish.  It is considered to have very good anti-gas properties, and hence it is used as mukhwas, or an after-meal digestive.  It is also traditionally given to mothers immediately after childbirth.

==Cultivation==

Successful cultivation requires warm to hot summers with high sunshine levels; even partial shade will reduce the yield substantially. It also prefers rich, well drained soil. The seeds are viable for 3–10 years.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}.

The seed is harvested by cutting the flower heads off the stalks when the seed is beginning to ripen. The seed heads are placed upside down in a paper bag and left in a warm dry place for a week. The seeds then separate from the stems easily for storage in an airtight container.

==Companion Planting==

When used as a [[companion plant]]ing, dill draws in many beneficial insects as the umbrella flower heads go to seed.  Fittingly, it makes a good companion plant for cucumbers. It is a poor companion for carrots and tomatoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://theselfsufficientgardener.com/2010/08/14/episode-17-my-favorite-herbs-dill/|title=The Self-Sufficient Gardener Podcast Episode 17 My Favorite Herbs - Dill}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[mathematics]], any [[vector space]], ''V'', has a corresponding '''dual vector space''' (or just '''dual space''' for short) consisting of all [[linear functional]]s on ''V''. Dual vector spaces defined on finite-dimensional vector spaces can be used for defining [[tensors]] which are studied in [[tensor algebra]]. When applied to vector spaces of functions (which typically are infinite-dimensional), dual spaces are employed for defining and studying concepts like [[Measure (mathematics)|measures]], [[Distribution (mathematics)|distributions]], and [[Hilbert space]]s. Consequently, the dual space is an important concept in the study of [[functional analysis]].

There are two types of dual spaces: the algebraic dual space, and the continuous dual space. The algebraic dual space is defined for all vector spaces.  When defined for a [[topological vector space]] there is a subspace of this dual space, corresponding to continuous linear functionals, which constitutes a ''continuous dual space''.

== Algebraic dual space ==
Given any [[vector space]] ''V'' over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] ''F'', the '''dual space''' ''V*'' is defined as the set of all [[linear map]]s {{nowrap|''φ'': ''V'' → ''F''}} ([[linear functional]]s). The dual space ''V*'' itself becomes a vector space over ''F'' when equipped with the following addition and scalar multiplication:
: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
    &amp; (\phi + \psi)(x) = \phi(x) + \psi(x) \\
    &amp; (a \phi)(x) = a \phi(x)
  \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
for all ''φ'', ''ψ'' ∈ ''V*'', ''x'' ∈ ''V'', and ''a'' ∈ ''F''. Elements of the algebraic dual space ''V*'' are sometimes called '''covectors''' or '''[[one-form]]s'''.

The pairing of a functional ''φ'' in the dual space ''V*'' and an element ''x'' of ''V'' is sometimes denoted by a bracket: {{nowrap|''φ''(''x'') {{=}} [''φ, x'']}} &lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Halmos|1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;
or {{nowrap|''φ''(''x'') {{=}} ⟨''φ, x''⟩}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Misner|Thorne|Wheeler|1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The pairing defines a nondegenerate [[bilinear mapping]]&lt;ref&gt;In many areas, such as [[quantum mechanics]], ⟨·,·⟩ is reserved for a [[sesquilinear form]] defined on {{nowrap|''V × V''}}.&lt;/ref&gt; {{nowrap|[·,·] : ''V* × V'' → ''F''}}.

=== Finite-dimensional case ===

If ''V'' is [[finite-dimensional]], then ''V*'' has the same dimension as ''V''. Given a [[basis of a vector space|basis]] {{nowrap|{'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}}} in ''V'', it is possible to construct a specific basis in ''V*'', called the '''[[dual basis]]'''. This dual basis is a set {{nowrap|{'''e'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, ..., '''e'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}} of linear functionals on ''V'', defined by the relation
: &lt;math&gt;
    \mathbf{e}^i(c_1 \mathbf{e}_1+\cdots+c_n\mathbf{e}_n) = c_i, \quad i=1,\ldots,n
  &lt;/math&gt;
for any choice of coefficients {{nowrap|''c&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' ∈ ''F''}}. In particular, letting in turn each one of those coefficients be equal to one and the other coefficients zero, gives the system of equations
: &lt;math&gt;
    \mathbf{e}^i(\mathbf{e}_j) = \delta_{ij}
      = \begin{cases}
          1, &amp; \text{if } i = j \\
          0, &amp; \text{if } i \ne j
        \end{cases}
  &lt;/math&gt;
where ''δ&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the [[Kronecker delta]] symbol. For example if ''V'' is the '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and its basis chosen to be {{nowrap|{'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} (1, 0), '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} (0, 1)}}}, then '''e'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; and '''e'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; are [[one-form]]s (functions which map a vector to a scalar) such that {{nowrap|'''e'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;('''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) {{=}} 1}}, {{nowrap|'''e'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;('''e'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) {{=}} 0}}, {{nowrap|'''e'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;('''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) {{=}} 0}}, and {{nowrap|'''e'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;('''e'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) {{=}} 1}}. (Note: The superscript here is the index, not an exponent).

In particular, if we interpret '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; as the space of columns of ''n'' [[real number]]s, its dual space is typically written as the space of ''rows'' of ''n'' real numbers. Such a row acts on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; as a linear functional by ordinary [[matrix multiplication]].

If ''V'' consists of the space of geometrical [[Vector (geometric)|vector]]s (arrows) in the plane, then the level curves of an element of ''V*'' form a family of parallel lines in ''V''. So an element of ''V*'' can be intuitively thought of as a particular family of parallel lines covering the plane. To compute the value of a functional on a given vector, one needs only to determine which of the lines the vector lies on. Or, informally, one &quot;counts&quot; how many lines the vector crosses. More generally, if ''V'' is a vector space of any dimension, then the level sets of a linear functional in ''V*'' are parallel hyperplanes in ''V'', and the action of a linear functional on a vector can be visualized in terms of these hyperplanes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Misner|Thorne|Wheeler|1973|loc=§2.5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Infinite-dimensional case ===
If ''V'' is not finite-dimensional but has a [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]]&lt;ref name=&quot;choice&quot;&gt;Several assertions in this article require the [[axiom of choice]] for their justification. The axiom of choice is needed to show that an arbitrary vector space has a basis: in particular it is needed to show that '''R&lt;sup&gt;N&lt;/sup&gt;''' has a basis. It is also needed to show that the dual of an infinite-dimensional vector space ''V'' is nonzero, and hence that the natural map from ''V'' to its double dual is injective.&lt;/ref&gt; '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''α''&lt;/sub&gt; indexed by an infinite set ''A'', then the same construction as in the finite-dimensional case yields [[linearly independent]] elements '''e'''&lt;sup&gt;''α''&lt;/sup&gt; ({{nowrap|''α'' ∈ ''A''}}) of the dual space, but they will not form a basis.

Consider, for instance, the space '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;, whose elements are those [[sequence]]s of real numbers which have only finitely many non-zero entries, which has a basis indexed by the natural numbers '''N''': for {{nowrap|''i'' ∈ '''N'''}}, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is the sequence which is zero apart from the ''i''th term, which is one. The dual space of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt; is '''R&lt;sup&gt;N&lt;/sup&gt;''', the space of all sequences of real numbers: such a sequence (''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'') is applied to an element (''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'') of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt; to give the number ∑''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'', which is a finite sum because there are only finitely many nonzero ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''. The [[dimension (vector space)|dimension]] of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt; is countably infinite, whereas '''R&lt;sup&gt;N&lt;/sup&gt;''' does not have a countable basis.

This observation generalizes to any&lt;ref name =&quot;choice&quot;/&gt; infinite-dimensional vector space ''V'' over any field ''F'': a choice of basis {{nowrap|{'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''α''&lt;/sub&gt; : ''α'' ∈ ''A''}}} identifies ''V'' with the space (''F&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt;'')&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; of functions {{nowrap|''ƒ'' : ''A → F''}} such that {{nowrap|''ƒ&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} ''ƒ''(''α'')}} is nonzero for only finitely many {{nowrap|''α'' ∈ ''A''}}, where such a function ''ƒ'' is identified with the vector
: &lt;math&gt;
    \sum_{\alpha\in A} f_\alpha\mathbf{e}_\alpha
  &lt;/math&gt;
in ''V'' (the sum is finite by the assumption on ''ƒ'', and any {{nowrap|''v'' ∈ ''V''}} may be written in this way by the definition of the basis).

The dual space of ''V'' may then be identified with the space ''F&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt;'' of ''all'' functions from ''A'' to ''F'': a linear functional ''T'' on ''V'' is uniquely determined by the values {{nowrap|''θ&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} ''T''('''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''α''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} it takes on the basis of ''V'', and any function {{nowrap|''θ'' : ''A → F''}} (with {{nowrap|''θ''(''α'') {{=}} ''θ&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;''}}) defines a linear functional ''T'' on ''V'' by
: &lt;math&gt;
    T\biggl(\sum_{\alpha\in A} f_\alpha \mathbf{e}_\alpha\biggr) = \sum_{\alpha\in A} \theta_\alpha f_\alpha.
  &lt;/math&gt;
Again the sum is finite because ''ƒ&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;'' is nonzero for only finitely many ''α''.

Note that (''F&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt;'')&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; may be identified (essentially by definition) with the [[Direct sum of modules|direct sum]]
of infinitely many copies of ''F'' (viewed as a 1-dimensional vector space over itself) indexed by ''A'', i.e., there are linear isomorphisms
: &lt;math&gt;
    V\cong (F^A)_0\cong\bigoplus_{\alpha\in A} {F}.
  &lt;/math&gt;

On the other hand ''F&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt;'' is (again by definition), the [[direct product]] of infinitely many copies of ''F'' indexed by ''A'', and so the identification
: &lt;math&gt;
    V^* \cong
    \biggl(\bigoplus_{\alpha\in A}F\biggr)^* \cong
    \prod_{\alpha\in A}F^* \cong
    \prod_{\alpha\in A}F \cong
    F^A
  &lt;/math&gt;
is a special case of a [[Direct sum of modules#Properties|general result]] relating direct sums (of modules) to direct products.

Thus if the basis is infinite, then there are ''always'' more vectors in the dual space than in the original vector space. This is in marked contrast to the case of the continuous dual space, discussed below, which may be [[isomorphic]] to the original vector space even if the latter is infinite-dimensional.

=== Bilinear products and dual spaces ===

If ''V'' is finite-dimensional, then ''V'' is isomorphic to ''V*''. But there is in general no [[natural isomorphism]] between these two spaces {{harv|MacLane|Birkhoff|1999|loc=§VI.4}}.   Any [[bilinear form]] ⟨•,•⟩ on ''V'' gives a mapping of ''V'' into its dual space via

:&lt;math&gt;v\mapsto \langle v, \cdot\rangle&lt;/math&gt;

where the right hand side is defined as the functional on ''V'' taking each {{nowrap|''w'' ∈ ''V''}} to ⟨''v'',''w''⟩.  In other words, the bilinear form determines a linear mapping

:&lt;math&gt;\Phi_{\langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle} : V\to V^*&lt;/math&gt;

defined by

:&lt;math&gt;[\Phi_{\langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle}(v),w] = \langle v, w\rangle.&lt;/math&gt;

If the bilinear form is assumed to be [[nondegenerate form|nondegenerate]], then this is an isomorphism onto a subspace of ''V*''.  If ''V'' is finite-dimensional, then this is an isomorphism onto all of ''V*''.  Conversely, any isomorphism Φ from ''V'' to a subspace of ''V*'' (resp., all of ''V*'') defines a unique nondegenerate bilinear form ⟨•,•⟩&lt;sub&gt;Φ&lt;/sub&gt; on ''V'' by

:&lt;math&gt; \langle v,w \rangle_\Phi = (\Phi (v))(w) = [\Phi (v),w].\,&lt;/math&gt;

Thus there is a one-to-one correspondence between isomorphisms of ''V'' to subspaces of (resp., all of) ''V*'' and nondegenerate bilinear forms on ''V''.

If the vector space ''V'' is over the [[complex numbers|complex]] field, then sometimes it is more natural to consider [[sesquilinear form]]s instead of bilinear forms.  In that case, a given sesquilinear form ⟨•,•⟩ determines an isomorphism of ''V'' with the [[Complex conjugate vector space|complex conjugate]] of the dual space
: &lt;math&gt;
    \Phi_{\langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle} : V\to \overline{V}^*.
  &lt;/math&gt;
The conjugate space ''&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:overline&quot;&gt;V&lt;/span&gt;*'' can be identified with the set of all additive complex-valued functionals {{nowrap|''ƒ''&amp;thinsp;: ''V'' → '''C'''}} such that
: &lt;math&gt;
    f(\alpha v) = \overline{\alpha}f(v).
  &lt;/math&gt;

=== Injection into the double-dual ===
There is a [[natural transformation|natural]] [[linear map|homomorphism]] Ψ from ''V'' into the double dual ''V**'', defined by {{nowrap|(Ψ(''v''))(''φ'') {{=}} ''φ''(''v'')}} for all {{nowrap|''v'' ∈ ''V''}}, {{nowrap|''φ'' ∈ ''V*''}}.  This map Ψ is always [[injective]];&lt;ref name=&quot;choice&quot;/&gt; it is an [[isomorphism]] if and only if ''V'' is finite-dimensional. (Infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces are not a counterexample to this, as they are isomorphic to their continuous duals, not to their algebraic duals.)

=== Transpose of a linear map ===   &lt;!-- this section is linked to in [[matrix (mathematics)]] and [[transpose]] --&gt;
If {{nowrap|''ƒ'' : ''V → W''}} is a [[linear map]], then the ''[[Transpose#Transpose of linear maps|transpose]]'' (or ''dual'') {{nowrap|''ƒ*'' : ''W* → V*''}} is defined by
: &lt;math&gt;
    f^*(\varphi) = \varphi \circ f \,
  &lt;/math&gt;
for every {{nowrap|''φ'' ∈ ''W*''}}. The resulting functional ''ƒ*''(''φ'') is in ''V*'', and is called as the ''[[pullback (differential geometry)|pullback]]'' of ''φ'' along ''ƒ''.

The following identity holds for all {{nowrap|''φ'' ∈ ''W*''}} and {{nowrap|''v'' ∈ ''V''}}:
: &lt;math&gt;
    [f^*(\varphi),\, v] = [\varphi,\, f(v)],
  &lt;/math&gt;
where the bracket [•,•] on the left is the duality pairing of ''V'' with its dual space, and that on the right is the duality pairing of ''W'' with its dual.  This identity characterizes the transpose,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Halmos|1974|loc=§44}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is formally similar to the definition of the [[adjoint of an operator|adjoint]].

The assignment {{nowrap|''ƒ'' ↦ ''ƒ*''}} produces an [[injective]] linear map between the space of linear operators from ''V'' to ''W'' and the space of linear operators from ''W*'' to ''V*''; this homomorphism is an [[isomorphism]] if and only if ''W'' is finite-dimensional. If {{nowrap|''V'' {{=}} ''W''}} then the space of linear maps is actually an [[algebra over a field|algebra]] under [[composition of maps]], and the assignment is then an [[antihomomorphism]] of algebras, meaning that {{nowrap|(''ƒg'')* {{=}} ''g*ƒ*''}}. In the language of [[category theory]], taking the dual of vector spaces and the transpose of linear maps is therefore a [[contravariant functor]] from the category of vector spaces over ''F'' to itself. Note that one can identify  (''ƒ*'')* with ''ƒ'' using the natural injection into the double dual.

If the linear map ''ƒ'' is represented by the [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] ''A'' with respect to two bases of ''V'' and ''W'', then ''ƒ*'' is represented by the [[transpose]] matrix ''A''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; with respect to the dual bases of ''W*'' and ''V*'', hence the name. Alternatively, as ''ƒ'' is represented by ''A'' acting on the left on column vectors, ''ƒ*'' is represented by the same matrix acting on the right on row vectors. These points of view are related by the canonical inner product on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, which identifies the space of column vectors with the dual space of row vectors.

=== Quotient spaces and annihilators ===
Let ''S'' be a subset of ''V''. The '''[[annihilator (ring theory)|annihilator]]''' of ''S'' in ''V*'', denoted here ''S&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;'', is the collection of linear functionals {{nowrap|''ƒ'' ∈ ''V*''}} such that {{nowrap|[''ƒ'', ''s''] {{=}} 0}} for all {{nowrap|''s'' ∈ ''S''}}. That is, ''S&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;'' consists of all linear functionals {{nowrap|''ƒ'' : ''V → F''}} such that the restriction to ''S'' vanishes: {{nowrap|''ƒ''{{!}}&lt;sub&gt;''S''&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 0}}.

The annihilator of a subset is itself a vector space. In particular, {{nowrap|∅&lt;sup&gt;''o''&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} ''V*''}} is all of ''V*'' ([[vacuously true|vacuously]]), whereas {{nowrap|''V&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;'' {{=}} 0}} is the zero subspace. Furthermore, the assignment of an annihilator to a subset of ''V'' reverses inclusions, so that if {{nowrap|''S'' ⊂ ''T'' ⊂ ''V''}}, then
: &lt;math&gt;
    0 \subset T^o \subset S^o \subset V^*.
  &lt;/math&gt;

Moreover, if ''A'' and ''B'' are two subsets of ''V'', then
: &lt;math&gt;
    (A \cap B)^o \supseteq A^o + B^o,
  &lt;/math&gt;
and equality holds provided ''V'' is finite-dimensional. If ''A&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is any family of subsets of ''V'' indexed by ''i'' belonging to some index set ''I'', then
: &lt;math&gt;
    \left(\bigcup_{i\in I} A_i\right)^o = \bigcap_{i\in I} A_i^o.
  &lt;/math&gt;
In particular if ''A'' and ''B'' are subspaces of ''V'', it follows that
: &lt;math&gt;
    (A + B)^o = A^o \cap B^o.\,
  &lt;/math&gt;

If ''V'' is finite-dimensional, and ''W'' is a [[vector subspace]], then
: &lt;math&gt;
    W^{oo} = W \,
  &lt;/math&gt;
after identifying ''W'' with its image in the second dual space under the double duality isomorphism {{nowrap|''V'' ≈ ''V**''}}.  Thus, in particular, forming the annihilator is a [[Galois connection]] on the lattice of subsets of a finite-dimensional vector space.

If ''W'' is a subspace of ''V'' then the [[quotient space (linear algebra)|quotient space]] ''V''/''W'' is a vector space in its own right, and so has a dual.  By the [[first isomorphism theorem]], a functional {{nowrap|''ƒ'' : ''V → F''}} factors through ''V''/''W'' if and only if ''W'' is in the [[kernel (mathematics)|kernel]] of ''ƒ''.  There is thus an isomorphism
: &lt;math&gt;
    (V/W)^* \cong W^o.
  &lt;/math&gt;
As a particular consequence, if ''V'' is a [[Direct sum of modules|direct sum]] of two subspaces ''A'' and ''B'', then ''V*'' is a direct sum of ''A&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;'' and ''B&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;''.

== Continuous dual space ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Reflexive space]] --&gt;
When dealing with [[topological vector space]]s, one is typically only interested in the [[continuous function (topology)|continuous]] linear functionals from the space into the base field. This gives rise to the notion of the{{q|continuous dual space}} which is a linear subspace of the algebraic dual space ''V*'', denoted {{nowrap|''V′''}}. For any ''finite-dimensional'' normed vector space or topological vector space, such as [[Euclidean space|Euclidean ''n-''space]], the continuous dual and the algebraic dual coincide. This is however false for any infinite-dimensional normed space, as shown by the example of [[discontinuous linear map]]s.

The continuous dual {{nowrap|''V′''}} of a [[normed vector space]] ''V'' (e.g., a [[Banach space]] or a [[Hilbert space]]) forms a normed vector space. A norm ||''φ''|| of a continuous linear functional on ''V'' is defined by
: &lt;math&gt;
    \|\varphi\| = \sup \{ |\varphi(x)| : \|x\| \le 1 \}.
  &lt;/math&gt;
This turns the continuous dual into a normed vector space, indeed into a Banach space so long as the underlying field is complete, which is often included in the definition of the normed vector space.  In other words, this dual of a normed space over a complete field is necessarily complete.

The continuous dual can be used to define a new topology on ''V'', called the [[weak topology]].

=== Examples ===
Let 1 &lt; ''p'' &lt; ∞ be a real number and consider the Banach space [[Lp space|''ℓ&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;p&lt;/sup&gt;'']] of all [[sequence]]s {{nowrap|'''a''' {{=}} (''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} for which
: &lt;math&gt;
    \|\mathbf{a}\|_p = \left ( \sum_{n=0}^\infty |a_n|^p \right) ^{1/p}
  &lt;/math&gt;
is finite. Define the number ''q'' by {{nowrap|1/''p'' + 1/''q'' {{=}} 1}}.  Then the continuous dual of ''ℓ&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;p&lt;/sup&gt;'' is naturally identified with ''ℓ&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;q&lt;/sup&gt;'': given an element {{nowrap|''φ'' ∈ (''ℓ&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;p&lt;/sup&gt;'')′}}, the corresponding element of {{nowrap|''ℓ&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;q&lt;/sup&gt;''}} is the sequence (''φ''('''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)) where '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; denotes the sequence whose ''n-''th term is 1 and all others are zero. Conversely, given an element {{nowrap|'''a''' {{=}} (''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'') ∈ ''ℓ&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;q&lt;/sup&gt;''}}, the corresponding continuous linear functional ''φ'' on {{nowrap|''ℓ&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;p&lt;/sup&gt;''}} is defined by {{nowrap|''φ''('''b''') {{=}} ∑&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;b&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} for all {{nowrap|'''b''' {{=}} (''b&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'') ∈ ''ℓ&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;p&lt;/sup&gt;''}} (see [[Hölder's inequality]]).

In a similar manner, the continuous dual of {{nowrap|''ℓ''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;1&lt;/sup&gt;}} is naturally identified with {{nowrap|''ℓ''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;∞&lt;/sup&gt;}} (the space of bounded sequences). Furthermore, the continuous duals of the Banach spaces ''c'' (consisting of all [[limit of a sequence|convergent]] sequences, with the [[supremum norm]]) and ''c''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; (the sequences converging to zero) are both naturally identified with {{nowrap|''ℓ''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;1&lt;/sup&gt;}}.

By the [[Riesz representation theorem]], the continuous dual of a Hilbert space is again a Hilbert space which is anti-isomorphic to the original space. This gives rise to the [[bra-ket notation]] used by physicists in the mathematical formulation of [[quantum mechanics]].

=== Transpose of a continuous linear map ===
If {{nowrap|''T'' : ''V → W''}} is a continuous linear map between two topological vector spaces, then the (continuous) transpose  {{nowrap|''T′'' : ''W′ → V′''}} is defined by the same formula as before:
: &lt;math&gt;
    T'(\varphi) = \varphi \circ T, \quad \varphi \in W'. \,
  &lt;/math&gt;
The resulting functional {{nowrap|''T′''(''φ'')}} is in{{nowrap| ''V′''}}. The assignment {{nowrap|''T → T′''}} produces a linear map between the space of continuous linear maps from ''V'' to ''W'' and the space of linear maps from {{nowrap|''W′''}} to {{nowrap|''V′''}}.  When ''T'' and ''U'' are composable continuous linear maps, then
: &lt;math&gt;
    (U \circ T)' = T' \circ U'. \,
  &lt;/math&gt;

When ''V'' and ''W'' are normed spaces, the norm of the transpose in{{nowrap| ''L''(''W′'', ''V′'')}} is equal to that of ''T'' in{{nowrap| ''L''(''V'', ''W'')}}. Several properties of transposition depend upon the [[Hahn–Banach theorem]]. For example, the bounded linear map ''T'' has dense range if and only if the transpose {{nowrap|''T′''}} is injective.

When ''T'' is a [[Compact operator|compact]] linear map between two Banach spaces ''V'' and ''W'', then the transpose {{nowrap|''T′''}} is compact. This can be proved using the [[Arzelà–Ascoli theorem]].

When ''V'' is a Hilbert space, there is an antilinear isomorphism ''i&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;'' from ''V'' onto its continuous dual{{nowrap| ''V′''}}. For every bounded linear map ''T'' on ''V'', the transpose and the [[Hermitian adjoint|adjoint]] operators are linked by
: &lt;math&gt;
    i_V \circ T^* = T' \circ i_V. \,
  &lt;/math&gt;

When ''T'' is a continuous linear map between two topological vector spaces ''V'' and ''W'', then the transpose {{nowrap|''T′''}} is continuous when {{nowrap|''W′''}} and {{nowrap|''V′''}} are equipped with{{q|compatible}} topologies: for example when, for {{nowrap|''X'' {{=}} ''V''}} and {{nowrap|''X'' {{=}} ''W''}}, both duals {{nowrap|''X′''}} have the [[Strong topology (polar topology)|strong topology]] {{nowrap|''β''(''X′'', ''X'')}} of uniform convergence on bounded sets of ''X'', or both have the weak-∗ topology {{nowrap|''σ''(''X′'', ''X'')}} of pointwise convergence on&amp;nbsp;''X''.  The transpose {{nowrap|''T′''}} is continuous from {{nowrap|''β''(''W′'', ''W'')}} to {{nowrap|''β''(''V′'', ''V'')}}, or from {{nowrap|''σ''(''W′'', ''W'')}} to {{nowrap|''σ''(''V′'', ''V'')}}.

=== Annihilators ===
Assume that ''W'' is a closed linear subspace of a normed space&amp;nbsp;''V'', and consider the annihilator of ''W'' in{{nowrap| ''V′''}},
: &lt;math&gt;
    W^\perp = \{ \varphi \in V' : W \subset \ker \varphi\}. \,
  &lt;/math&gt;
Then, the dual of the quotient {{nowrap|''V''&amp;thinsp;/&amp;thinsp;''W''&amp;thinsp;}} can be identified with ''W''&lt;sup&gt;⊥&lt;/sup&gt;, and the dual of ''W'' can be identified with the quotient {{nowrap|''V′''&amp;thinsp;/&amp;thinsp;''W''&lt;sup&gt;⊥&lt;/sup&gt;}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Rudin|1991|loc=chapter 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, let ''P'' denote the canonical [[surjection]] from ''V'' onto the quotient {{nowrap|''V''&amp;thinsp;/&amp;thinsp;''W''&amp;thinsp;}}; then, the transpose {{nowrap|''P′''}} is an isometric isomorphism from {{nowrap|(''V''&amp;thinsp;/&amp;thinsp;''W''&amp;thinsp;)′}} into{{nowrap| ''V′''}}, with range equal to ''W''&lt;sup&gt;⊥&lt;/sup&gt;. If ''j'' denotes the injection map from ''W'' into ''V'', then the kernel of the transpose {{nowrap|''j′''}} is the annihilator of ''W'':
:&lt;math&gt;\ker (j') = W^\perp&lt;/math&gt;
and it follows from the [[Hahn–Banach theorem]] that {{nowrap|''j′''}} induces an isometric isomorphism
{{nowrap|''V′''&amp;thinsp;/&amp;thinsp;''W''&lt;sup&gt;⊥&lt;/sup&gt; → ''W′''}}.

=== Further properties ===
If the dual of a normed space ''V'' is [[separable space|separable]], then so is the space ''V'' itself. The converse is not true: for example the space {{nowrap|''ℓ''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;1&lt;/sup&gt;}} is separable, but its dual is {{nowrap|''ℓ''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;∞&lt;/sup&gt;}} is not.

=== Double dual ===
In analogy with the case of the algebraic double dual, there is always a naturally defined continuous linear operator {{nowrap|Ψ : ''V'' → ''V′′''}} from a normed space ''V'' into its continuous double dual{{nowrap| ''V′′''}}, defined by
: &lt;math&gt;
    \Psi(x)(\varphi) = \varphi(x), \quad x \in V, \ \varphi \in V'. \,
  &lt;/math&gt;

As a consequence of the [[Hahn–Banach theorem]], this map is in fact an [[isometry]], meaning {{nowrap|{{!!}}Ψ(''x''){{!!}} {{=}} {{!!}}''x''{{!!}}}} for all ''x'' in&amp;nbsp;''V''. Normed spaces for which the map Ψ is a [[bijection]] are called [[reflexive space|reflexive]].

When ''V'' is a [[topological vector space]], one can still define Ψ(''x'') by the same formula, for every {{nowrap|''x'' ∈ ''V''}}, however several difficulties arise. First, when ''V'' is not [[Locally convex topological vector space|locally convex]], the continuous dual may be equal to {0} and the map Ψ trivial.  However, if ''V'' is [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] and locally convex, the map Ψ is injective from ''V'' to the algebraic dual {{nowrap|''V′*''}} of the continuous dual, again as a consequence of the Hahn–Banach theorem.&lt;ref&gt;If ''V'' is locally convex but not Hausdorff, the [[kernel (mathematics)|kernel]] of Ψ is the smallest closed subspace containing {0}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Second, even in the locally convex setting, several natural vector space topologies can be defined on the continuous dual {{nowrap|''V′''}}, so that the continuous double dual {{nowrap|''V′′''}} is not uniquely defined as a set. Saying that Ψ maps from ''V'' to {{nowrap|''V′′''}}, or in other words, that Ψ(''x'') is continuous on {{nowrap|''V′''}} for every {{nowrap|''x'' ∈ ''V''}}, is a reasonable minimal requirement on the topology of {{nowrap|''V′''}}, namely that the evaluation mappings
: &lt;math&gt;
    \varphi \in V' \mapsto \varphi(x), \quad x \in V, \,
  &lt;/math&gt;
be continuous for the chosen topology on {{nowrap|''V′''}}. Further, there is still a choice of a topology on {{nowrap|''V′′''}}, and continuity of Ψ depends upon this choice. As a consequence, defining [[Reflexive space#Locally convex spaces|reflexivity]] in this framework is more involved than in the normed case.

'''Dianetics''' is a set of ideas and practices regarding the metaphysical relationship between the mind and body that was invented by the science fiction author [[L. Ron Hubbard]] and is practiced by followers of [[Scientology]].  Hubbard coined ''Dianetics'' from the [[Greek language|Greek]] stems ''dia'', meaning through, and ''nous'', meaning [[mind]].

Dianetics explores the existence of a mind with three parts: the conscious &quot;analytical mind,&quot; the subconscious &quot;[[reactive mind]]&quot;, and the somatic mind.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of Religious Freedom, Catharine Cookson, Taylor &amp; Francis, 2003, ISBN 0-415-94181-4.(page 430/431)&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of Dianetics is to remove the so-called &quot;reactive mind&quot; that scientologists believe prevents people from becoming more ethical, more aware, happier and saner. The Dianetics procedure to achieve this is called &quot;auditing&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Philosophers and Religious Leaders: An Encyclopedia of People Who Changed the World, Christian D. Von Dehsen &amp; Scott L. Harris, Greenwood Publishing Group, 1999, ISBN 1-57356-152-5. (page 90).&lt;/ref&gt; Auditing is a process whereby a series of questions are asked by the Scientology auditor, in an attempt to rid the auditee of the painful experiences of the past which scientologists believe to be the cause of the &quot;reactive mind&quot;.

Dianetics grew out of Hubbard's personal experiences and experiments and has been described as a mix of &quot;Western technology and Oriental philosophy&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;James R. Lewis 1997, page 287&quot;&gt;James R. Lewis, &quot;Clearing the Planet: Utopian Idealism and the Church of Scientology&quot; in: Syzygy, Journal of Alternative Religion and Culture, Vol.6:1-2, 1997, page 287; ISSN 1059-6860&lt;/ref&gt; Hubbard stated that Dianetics &quot;forms a bridge between&quot; [[cybernetics]] and [[General Semantics]], a set of ideas about education originated by [[Alfred Korzybski]] that was receiving much attention in the science fiction world in the 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, &quot;[http://www.dianetics.org/en_US/l-ron-hubbard/articles/terra/ Terra Incognita: The Mind],&quot; ''The Explorers Journal'', winter 1949 / spring 1950 (on the bridge between cybernetics and general semantics)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Kendig, editor ''Alfred Korzybski: Collected Writings, 1920-1950'', ch. 12, Institute of [[General Semantics]], 1990 ISBN 0-910780-08-0. (Presented at the First American Congress for General Semantics, May 1935).&lt;/ref&gt; Hubbard claimed that Dianetics can increase intelligence, eliminate unwanted emotions and alleviate a wide range of illnesses he believed to be [[psychosomatic]]. Among the conditions purportedly treated against are arthritis, allergies, asthma, some coronary difficulties, eye trouble, ulcers, migraine headaches, sex deviations and even death.&lt;ref name=TwoMinds&gt;{{cite web | title = Of Two Minds | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,812852,00.html | work = [[Time (magazine)|TIME Magazine]] | date = 1950-07-24 | accessdate = 2008-07-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dianetics predates Hubbard's classification of [[Scientology]] as &quot;applied religious philosophy&quot;. Early in 1951, he expanded his writings to include teachings related to the soul, or &quot;[[thetan]]&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

Dianetics is also practiced by independent groups, collectively called the [[Free Zone (Scientology)|Free Zone]]. The Church of Scientology disapproves of Free Zone activities and has prosecuted them in court for misappropriation of Scientology/Dianetics copyrights and trademarks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salon.com/tech/feature/1999/07/22/scientology/print.html Copyright -- or wrong?, Salon.com, July 22, 1999]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

{{Main|History of Dianetics}}

Hubbard always claimed that his ideas of Dianetics originated in the 1920s and 1930s. By his own account, he spent a great deal of time in the [[Naval Hospital Oakland|Oak Knoll Naval Hospital's]] library, where he would have encountered the work of Freud and other [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalysts]]. In April 1950, Hubbard and several others established the Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation in [[Elizabeth, New Jersey]] to coordinate work related for the forthcoming publication. Hubbard first introduced Dianetics to the public in the article ''[[Dianetics: The Evolution of a Science]]'' published in the May 1950 issue of the magazine ''[[Astounding Science Fiction]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Creation&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.solitarytrees.net/pubs/skent/creation.htm?FACTNet#txtref02 | title = The Creation of 'Religious' Scientology | publisher = Religious Studies and Theology | accessdate = 2006-05-08}} Originally published by Stephen A. Kent in December, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Hubbard wrote ''[[Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health]]'' at that time, allegedly completing the 180,000-word book in six weeks.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;L.R.H. Biography,&quot; Sea Org Flag Information Letter 67, 31 October 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

The success of selling ''Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health'' brought in a flood of money, which Hubbard used to establish Dianetics foundations in six major American cities. The scientific and medical communities were far less enthusiastic about Dianetics, viewing it with bemusement, concern, or outright derision. Complaints were made against local Dianetics practitioners for allegedly practicing medicine without a license. This eventually prompted Dianetics advocates to disclaim any medicinal benefits in order to avoid regulation.

Hubbard explained the backlash as a response from various entities trying to co-opt Dianetics for their own use. Hubbard blamed the hostile press coverage in particular on a plot by the [[American Communist Party]]. In later years, Hubbard decided that the psychiatric profession was the origin of all of the criticism of Dianetics, as he believed it secretly controlled most of the world's governments.&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, &quot;Ron's Journal 67,&quot; taped message of 20 September 1969&lt;/ref&gt;

By the autumn of 1950, financial problems had developed, and by November 1950, the six Foundations had spent around one million dollars and were more than $200,000 in debt.&lt;ref&gt;''Dianetics and the Professions'', A.E. van Vogt, 1953&lt;/ref&gt; Disagreements emerged over the direction of the Dianetic Foundation's work, and relations between the board members became strained, with several leaving, even to support causes critical of Dianetics. One example was [[Harvey Jackins]], founder of [[Re-evaluation Counseling#Origins of RC as an adaptation of Dianetics|Re-evaluation Counselling]], originally a sort of discrete reworking of Dianetics, which L Ron Hubbard later declared [[Suppressive Person|suppressive]] to Scientology.

In January 1951, the New Jersey Board of Medical Examiners instituted proceedings against the Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation in Elizabeth for teaching medicine without a licence.&lt;ref&gt;''Bulletin of the Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation'', Elizabeth, NJ. January 1951&lt;/ref&gt; The Foundation closed its doors, causing the proceedings to be vacated, but its creditors began to demand settlement of its outstanding debts. Don Purcell, a millionaire Dianeticist from [[Wichita, Kansas]], offered a brief respite from bankruptcy, but the Foundation's finances failed again in 1952.&lt;ref name=&quot;barefaced&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author=Miller, Russell | authorlink=Russell Miller| title=Bare-faced Messiah, The True Story of L. Ron Hubbard | publisher=Henry Holt &amp; Co | location=New York | edition=First American Edition | year=1987 | isbn=0-8050-0654-0 | pages = 305–306 | url = http://www.clambake.org/archive/books/bfm/bfmconte.htm |chapter=11. Bankrolling and Bankruptcy | chapterurl=http://www.clambake.org/archive/books/bfm/bfm11.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of a sale of assets resulting from the bankruptcy, Hubbard no longer owned the rights to the name &quot;Dianetics&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;barefaced&quot;/&gt; but its philosophical framework still provided the seed for [[Scientology]] to grow. Scientologists refer to the book ''Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health'' as &quot;Book One.&quot; In 1952, Hubbard published a new set of teachings as &quot;Scientology, a religious philosophy.&quot; Scientology did not replace Dianetics but extended it to cover new areas. Where the goal of Dianetics is to rid the individual of his [[reactive mind]] [[engram (Dianetics)|engrams]], the stated goal of Scientology is to rehabilitate the individual's spiritual nature so that he may reach his full potential.

In 1978, Hubbard released ''New Era Dianetics'' (NED), a revised version supposed to produce better results in a shorter period of time. The course consists of 11 [[rundown (Scientology)|rundowns]] and requires a specifically trained auditor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.auditing.org/13-ned.htm| title=New Era Dianetics Auditing| accessdate=2006-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is run (processed) exactly like Standard Dianetics (once very widely practiced before the advent of NED) except the pre-clear (parishioner) is encouraged to find the &quot;postulate&quot; he made before the incident occurred.&lt;ref&gt;L. Ron Hubbard ''New Era Dianetics Series 7RA'', HCOB 28 June 1978RA revised 15 September 1978, Hubbard Communications Office (HCO).&lt;/ref&gt;  (&quot;Postulate&quot; in Dianetics and Scientology has the meaning of &quot;a conclusion, decision or resolution made by the individual himself; to conclude, decide or resolve a problem or to set a pattern for the future or to nullify a pattern of the past&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scientology.ie/p_jpg/wis/wiseng/gloss.htm#p The Official Scientology and Dianetics Glossary&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; in contrast to its conventional meanings.)

New Era Dianetics is really only a prelude to what is available at the high levels of the Bridge including the [[incident (Scientology)|incidents]]: New Era Dianetics for [[OT (Scientology)|OTs]] also known as [[NOTs|NOTS]]. It is available after [[Xenu]] and the now well known [[Operating Thetan#OT III: The Wall of Fire|First Wall of Fire]]. NOTS is also known as the [[Operating Thetan#OT V: New Era Dianetics for OTs|Second Wall of Fire]]. [[Free Zone (Scientology)]] offers a version of it in the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/NOTs/aa5b.html Advanced level 5] - The NOTs(New Era Dianetics for Operating Thetans)Scholars Home Page (Scientology) - Dave Touretzky's Page&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basic concepts==
In the book, ''[[Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health]]'', Hubbard describes techniques that he suggests can rid individuals of fears and psychosomatic illnesses. A basic idea in Dianetics is that the mind consists of two parts: the &quot;analytical mind&quot; and the &quot;[[reactive mind]].&quot; The &quot;reactive mind&quot; (or, &quot;unconscious mind&quot;) acts as a record of shock, trauma, pain, and otherwise harmful memories. Experiences such as these, stored in the &quot;reactive mind&quot; are dubbed &quot;[[engram (Dianetics)|engrams]]&quot;. Dianetics is a proposed method to erase these &quot;engrams&quot; in the &quot;reactive mind&quot; to achieve what is referred to in Scientology as a state of &quot;Clear&quot;. A &quot;Clear&quot; is one who is thought to no longer possess his reactive mind.&lt;ref name=&quot;James R. Lewis 1997, page 287&quot;/&gt;

By his own admission, Hubbard made what he considered was one of the greatest mistakes of his life when he used the biological definition of engram as a &quot;trace on a cell&quot;. Science would eventually be able to debunk the false definition in [[Biology]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Pitirim Alexandrovich Sorokin]] ''The Ways and Power of Love'', pp. 186-187, Templeton Foundation Press, 2002 ISBN 978-1-890151-86-7; first edition 1954: Harvard Research Center in Creative Altruism&lt;/ref&gt;

Hubbard described Dianetics as &quot;an organized science of thought built on definite axioms: statements of [[natural law]]s on the order of those of the physical sciences&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Winter, J.A. ''Dianetics: A Doctor's Report'', p. 18 (Julian Press, 1987 reprint)&lt;/ref&gt; These Dianetic &quot;axioms&quot; can be found in Hubbard books such as ''Scientology 0-8: The Book of Basics'' and ''Advanced Procedures and Axioms''. Unlike conventional therapies, Hubbard said, Dianetics would work every time if applied properly and &quot;will invariably cure all psychosomatic ills and human aberrations.&quot;{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} In April 1950, before the public release of Dianetics, he wrote: &quot;To date, over two hundred patients have been treated; of those two hundred, two hundred cures have been obtained.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, &quot;Dianetics&quot;. ''Astounding Science Fiction'', May 1950.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Dianetics, the unconscious or reactive mind is described as a collection of &quot;mental image pictures,&quot; which contain the recorded experience of past moments of unconsciousness, including all sensory perceptions and feelings involved, ranging from [[pre-natal]] experiences, infancy and childhood, even the traumatic feelings associated events from past lives and alien cultures. The type of mental image picture created during a period of [[unconsciousness]] involves the exact recording of a painful experience. Hubbard called this phenomenon an [[engram (Dianetics)|engram]], and defined it as &quot;a complete recording of a moment of unconsciousness containing physical pain or painful emotion and all perceptions.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health]] page 79 and Glossary&lt;/ref&gt;

Hubbard proposed that, via pain, physical or mental traumas caused &quot;aberrations&quot; (deviations from rational thinking) in the mind, which produced adverse physical and emotional effects. The conscious or analytical mind, out of a desire for survival, would instinctively shut down during moments of stress. The memories recorded during this period would be stored as engrams in the unconscious or reactive mind.  (In Hubbard's earliest publications on the subject, engrams were variously referred to as &quot;Norns&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Creation&quot;/&gt; &quot;Impediments,&quot; and &quot;comanomes&quot; before &quot;engram&quot; was adapted from its existing usage at the suggestion of [[Joseph Winter]].)&lt;ref name=&quot;Blue Sky&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Atack | first = Jon | authorlink = Jon Atack | year = 1990 | title = A Piece of Blue Sky | publisher = Carol Publishing Group | location = New York, NY | isbn = 0-8184-0499-X| pages=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some commentators noted Dianetics' blend of science fiction and [[occult]] orientations at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Creation&quot;/&gt;

Dianetics claims that these engrams are the cause of almost all psychological and physical problems. In addition to containing the experience of physical pain, engrams can also include words or phrases overheard by the patient while he was unconscious. For instance, Winter cites the example of a patient with a persistent headache supposedly tracing the problem to a doctor saying &quot;Take him now&quot; during the preclear's birth.&lt;ref&gt;Winter, ''Dianetics: A Doctor's Report'', p. 165&lt;/ref&gt;  Hubbard similarly claims that the cause of [[leukemia]] is traceable to &quot;an engram containing the phrase 'It turns my blood to water.'&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, ''A History of Man'', p.20. American Saint Hill Organization, 1968&lt;/ref&gt;  While it is sometimes claimed that the Church of Scientology no longer stands by Hubbard's claims that Dianetics can treat physical conditions, it still publishes them:  &quot;... when the knee injuries of the past are located and discharged, the [[arthritis]] ceases, no other injury takes its place and the person is finished with arthritis of the knee.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, L. Ron. [http://www.smi.org/route/page06.htm &quot;The Discoveries of Dianetics&quot;].  Retrieved 22 April 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;[The reactive mind] can give a man arthritis, [[bursitis]], [[asthma]], [[allergy|allergies]], [[sinusitis]], [[Coronary circulation|coronary]] trouble, high [[blood pressure]] ... And it is the only thing in the human being which can produce these effects ... Discharge the content of [the reactive mind] and the arthritis vanishes, [[myopia]] gets better, heart illness decreases, asthma disappears, stomachs function properly and the whole catalog of ills goes away and stays away.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, L. Ron. [http://www.dianetics.org/en_US/info/01/pg003.html &quot;What is the Reactive Mind?&quot;].  Retrieved 28 April 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the [[psychometrics|psychometric]] ideas in Dianetics can be traced to [[Sigmund Freud]], whom Hubbard credited as an inspiration and was said to have used as a source.&lt;ref&gt;Letter from John W. Campbell, cited in Winter, p. 3 - &quot;His approach is, actually, based on some very early work of Freud&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Freud had speculated 40 years previously that traumas with similar content join together in &quot;chains,&quot; embedded in the unconscious mind, to cause irrational responses in the individual. Such a chain would be relieved by inducing the patient to remember the earliest trauma, &quot;with an accompanying expression of emotion.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Breuer and Sigmund Freud, &quot;Studies in Hysteria&quot;, Vol II of the ''Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud''. Hogarth Press, London (1955).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;L. Ron Hubbard ''A Critique of Psychoanalysis'', PAB 92, 10 July 1956.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Bent Corydon, Hubbard created the illusion that Dianetics was the first [[psychotherapy]] to address [[traumatic experience]]s in their own time, but others had done so as standard procedure.

One treatment method Hubbard drew from in developing Dianetics was [[abreaction therapy]].  [[Abreaction]] is a [[psychoanalytical]] [[technical terminology|term]] that means bringing to [[consciousness]], and thus adequate expression, material that has been unconscious.&quot; It includes not only the recollection of forgotten memories and [[experience]], but also their reliving with appropriate emotional display and discharge of effect. This process is usually facilitated by the patient's gaining awareness of the [[causal relationship]] between the previously undischarged [[emotion]] and his [[symptom]]s.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bent Corydon ''L. Ron Hubbard, Messiah or Madman?'', pp. 283-4, Barricade Books Inc., 1992 ISBN 0-942637-57-7&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Hubbard, before Dianetics psychotherapists may have been able to deal with very light and superficial incidents (e.g. an incident that reminds you of a moment of loss), but with Dianetic therapy, the patient can actually erase moments of pain and unconsciousness. He emphasizes: &quot;The discovery of the engram is entirely the property of Dianetics. Methods of its erasure are also owned entirely by Dianetics...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''A Critique of Psychoanalysis'', ibid. Pab 92&lt;/ref&gt;

With the use of Dianetics techniques, Hubbard claimed, the reactive mind could be processed and all stored engrams could be refiled as experience. The central technique was &quot;auditing,&quot; a two-person [[talk therapy|question-and-answer therapy]] designed to isolate and dissipate engrams (or &quot;mental masses&quot;). An auditor addresses questions to a subject, observes and records the subject's responses, and returns repeatedly to experiences or areas under discussion that appear painful until the troubling experience has been identified and confronted. Through repeated applications of this method, the reactive mind could be &quot;cleared&quot; of its content having outlived its usefulness in the [[Process (science)|process]] of [[evolution]]; a person who has completed this process would be &quot;Clear&quot;.

The benefits of going Clear, according to Hubbard, were dramatic. A Clear would have no compulsions, repressions, [[psychosis|psychoses]] or [[neurosis|neuroses]], and would enjoy a near-perfect memory as well as a rise in [[IQ]] of as much as 50 points. He also claimed that &quot;the atheist is activated by engrams as thoroughly as the zealot&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, &quot;Dianetics and Religion,&quot; ''Dianetic Auditor's Bulletin'' vol. 1 no. 4, October 1950&lt;/ref&gt; He further believed that widespread application of Dianetics would result in &quot;A world without [[insanity]], without criminals and without war.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, ''Science of Survival: Prediction of Human Behavior'' p. 1, Bridge Publications, 1990 (reissue).&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Scientology journal ''The Auditor'', the total number of &quot;Clears&quot; as of May 2006 stands at 50,311.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Auditor,&quot; The Monthly Journal of Scientology, published by the American Saint Hill Organization, 1413 L. Ron Hubbard Way, Los Angeles, CA 90027, Issue 330, May 2006, page 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific evaluation and criticisms==

Hubbard's original book on Dianetics attracted highly critical reviews from science and medical writers and organizations. The [[American Psychological Association]] passed a resolution in 1950 calling &quot;attention to the fact that these claims are not supported by [[empiricism|empirical]] evidence of the sort required for the establishment of scientific generalizations.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Psychologists Act Against Dianetics&quot;, ''New York Times'', 9 September 1950&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=timeapa&gt;{{cite web | title = Tests &amp;amp; Poison | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,813284,00.html | work = [[Time (magazine)|TIME Magazine]] | date = 1950-09-18 | accessdate = 2008-02-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, Dianetics has achieved no acceptance as a [[scientific theory]] and scientists cite Dianetics as an example of a [[pseudoscience]].&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. Gardner, ''[[Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science]]''; Bauer, ''Scientific Literacy and the Myth of the Scientific Method'' and ''Science Or Pseudoscience: Magnetic Healing, Psychic Phenomena, and Other Heterodoxies''; Corsini ''et al.'', ''The Dictionary of Psychology''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Demise of the Dogmatic Universe|title=Historical Encyclopedia of Natural and Mathematical Sciences|author=Ari Ben-Menahem|isbn=978-3-540-68831-0|year=2009|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|doi=10.1007/978-3-540-68832-7|pages=4301–4302}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Few scientific investigations into the effectiveness of Dianetics have been published. Professor John A. Lee states in his 1970 evaluation of Dianetics:

:Objective experimental verification of Hubbard's [[physiology|physiological]] and psychological doctrines is lacking. To date, no regular scientific agency has established the validity of his theories of prenatal perception and engrams, or cellular memory, or Dianetic reverie, or the effects of Scientology auditing routines. Existing knowledge contradicts Hubbard's theory of recording of perceptions during periods of unconsciousness.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, John A. ''Sectarian Healers and Hypnotherapy'', 1970, Ontario&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[MEDLINE]] database records two independent scientific studies on Dianetics, both conducted in the 1950s under the auspices of [[New York University]]. Harvey Jay Fischer tested Dianetics therapy against three claims made by proponents and found it does not effect any significant changes in intellectual functioning, mathematical ability, or the degree of personality conflicts;&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, Harvey Jay. &quot;Dianetic therapy: an experimental evaluation. A statistical analysis of the effect of dianetic therapy as measured by group tests of intelligence, mathematics and personality.&quot; Abstract of Ph.D. thesis, 1953, New York University ([http://home.snafu.de/tilman/krasel/dianetics_test2.html Excerpt])&lt;/ref&gt; Jack Fox tested Hubbard's thesis regarding recall of engrams, with the assistance of the Dianetic Research Foundation, and could not substantiate it.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, J.; Davis, A.E.; Lebovits, B. &quot;An experimental investigation of Hubbard's engram hypothesis (dianetics)&quot;. ''Psychological Newsletter'', New York University. 10 1959, 131-134&lt;/ref&gt;

Hubbard claimed, in an interview with the ''[[New York Times]]'' in November 1950, that &quot;he had already submitted proof of claims made in the book to a number of scientists and associations.&quot; He added that the public as well as proper organizations were entitled to such proof and that he was ready and willing to give such proof in detail.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Psychologists Act Against Dianetics&quot;, New York Times, 9 September 1950&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1951, the Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation of [[Elizabeth, NJ]] published ''Dianetic Processing: A Brief Survey of Research Projects and Preliminary Results'', a booklet providing the results of psychometric tests conducted on 88 people undergoing Dianetics therapy. It presents case histories and a number of [[X-ray]] plates to support claims that Dianetics had cured &quot;aberrations&quot; including [[Bipolar disorder|manic depression]], asthma, [[arthritis]], [[colitis]] and &quot;overt homosexuality,&quot; and that after Dianetic processing, test subjects experienced significantly increased scores on a standardized IQ test. The report's subjects are not identified by name, but one of them is clearly Hubbard himself (&quot;Case 1080A, R. L.&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;Benton, Peggy; Ibanex, Dalmyra.; Southon, Gordon; Southon, Peggy. ''Dianetic Processing: A Brief Survey of Research Projects and Preliminary Results'', Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation, 1951&lt;/ref&gt;

The authors provide no qualifications, although they are described in Hubbard's book ''Science of Survival'' (where some results of the same study were reprinted) as psychotherapists. Critics of Dianetics are skeptical of this study, both because of the bias of the source and because the researchers appear to ascribe all physical benefits to Dianetics without considering possible outside factors; in other words, the report lacks any [[scientific control]]s.  J.A. Winter, M.D., originally an associate of Hubbard and an early adopter of Dianetics, had by the end of 1950 cut his ties with Hubbard and written an account of his personal experiences with Dianetics. He described Hubbard as &quot;absolutistic and authoritarian&quot;,&lt;ref name=departure/&gt; and criticized the Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation for failing to undertake &quot;precise scientific research into the functioning of the mind&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Winter, ''Dianetics: A Doctor's Report'', p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; He also recommended that auditing be done by experts only and that it was dangerous for laymen to audit each other.&lt;ref name=departure&gt;{{cite web | title = Departure in Dianetics | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,821638,00.html | work = [[Time (magazine)|TIME Magazine]] | date = 1951-09-03 | accessdate = 2008-02-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hubbard writes: &quot;Again, Dianetics is not being released to a profession, for no profession could encompass it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;L. Ron Hubbard ''Dianetics: the Modernd Science of Mental Health'', p. 204, Bridge Publications Inc., 2007 ISBN 978-1-4031-4484-3; 1st ed. 1950&lt;/ref&gt;

Commentators from a variety of backgrounds have described Dianetics as an example of pseudoscience&amp;mdash;that is, information presented as scientific that fails to meet the basic criteria for science.  For example, [[philosophy]] professor [[Robert Todd Carroll|Robert Carroll]] points to Dianetics' lack of empirical evidence:

:What Hubbard touts as a science of mind lacks one key element that is expected of a science: empirical testing of claims. The key elements of Hubbard's so-called science don't seem testable, yet he repeatedly claims that he is asserting only scientific facts and data from many experiments. It isn't even clear what such &quot;data&quot; would look like. Most of his data is in the form of anecdotes and speculations ... Such speculation is appropriate in fiction, but not in science.&lt;ref&gt;Carroll, Robert T. [http://skepdic.com/dianetic.html &quot;Dianetics&quot;], ''Skeptics Dictionary''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[W. Sumner Davis]] similarly comments that

:Dianetics is nothing more than an example of pseudoscience trying to legitimize itself ... Hubbard, had he indeed been a scientist, would have known that truth is not built on axioms, and facts cannot be found from some a-priori knowledge. A true science is constructed on [[hypothesis|hypotheses]], which are arrived at by the virtue of observed phenomena. Scientific knowledge is gained by observation and testing, not believing from some [[subconscious]] stipulation, as Hubbard would have us believe.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, W. Sumner. ''Just Smoke and Mirrors: Religion, Fear and Superstition in Our Modern World'', Writers Club Press, 2001 (ISBN 0-595-26523-5)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Procedure in practice==
[[File:Dianetics demo at Union Station.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Scientologist]]s promoting Dianetics at [[Union Station (Washington, D.C.)|Union Station]] in Washington, D.C.]]
The procedure of Dianetics therapy (known as ''auditing'') is a two-person activity. One person, the &quot;auditor&quot;, guides the other person, the &quot;preclear&quot;. The preclear's job is to look at the mind and talk to the auditor. The auditor acknowledges what the preclear says and controls the process so the preclear may put his full attention on his work.

The auditor and preclear sit down in chairs facing each other. The process then follows in eleven distinct steps:&lt;ref&gt;This description is based on &quot;[http://www.rehabilitatenz.co.nz/pages/dianetics-auditing-steps.html The Dianetics Procedure - 10 Simple Steps]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

:1. The auditor assures the preclear that he will be fully aware of everything that happens during the session.

:2. The preclear is instructed to close his eyes for the session, entering a state of &quot;dianetic reverie&quot;, signified by &quot;a tremble of the lashes&quot;. During the session, the preclear remains in full possession of his will and retains full recall thereafter.

:3. The auditor installs a &quot;canceller&quot;, an instruction intended to absolutely cancel any form of positive suggestion that could accidentally occur. This is done by saying &quot;In the future, when I utter the word 'cancelled,' everything I have said to you while you are in a therapy session will be cancelled and will have no force with you. Any suggestion I may have made to you will be without force when I say the word 'cancelled.' Do you understand?&quot;

:4. The auditor then asks the preclear to locate an exact record of something that happened to the preclear in his past: &quot;Locate an incident that you feel you can comfortably face.&quot;

:5. The preclear is invited by the auditor to &quot;Go through the incident and say what is happening as you go along.&quot;

:6a. The auditor instructs the preclear to recall as much as possible of the incident, going over it several times &quot;until the preclear is cheerful about it&quot;.

:6b. When the preclear is cheerful about an incident, the auditor instructs the preclear to locate another incident: &quot;Let's find another incident that you feel you can comfortably face.&quot; The process outlined at steps 5 and 6a then repeats until the auditing session's time limit (usually two hours or so) is reached.

:7. The preclear is instructed to &quot;return to present time&quot;.

:8. The auditor checks to make sure that the preclear feels himself to be in &quot;present time&quot;, i.e. not still recalling a past incident.

:9. The auditor gives the preclear the canceller word: &quot;Very good. Cancelled.&quot;

:10. The auditor tells the preclear to feel alert and return to full awareness of his surroundings: &quot;When I count from five to one and snap my fingers you will feel alert. Five, four, three, two, one.&quot; (snaps fingers)

Auditing sessions are kept confidential. This has come into question, though, that confidential information has been used to blackmail possible defectors (see [[Fair Game Scientology]]) However, a few transcripts of auditing sessions with [[Sanitization (classified information)|confidential information removed]] have been published as demonstration examples. Some extracts can be found in Dr. J.A. Winter's book ''[[Dianetics: A Doctor's Report]]''. Other, more comprehensive, transcripts of auditing sessions carried out by Hubbard himself can be found in volume 1 of the ''Research &amp; Discovery Series'' (Bridge Publications, 1980). Examples of public group processing sessions can be found throughout the Congress Lecture series.

According to Hubbard, auditing enables the preclear to &quot;contact&quot; and &quot;release&quot; engrams stored in the reactive mind, relieving him of the physical and mental aberrations connected with them. The preclear is asked to inspect and familiarize himself with the exact details of his own experience; the auditor may not tell him anything about his case or evaluate any of the information the preclear finds.

The validity and practice of auditing have been questioned by a variety of non-Scientologist commentators. Commenting on the example cited by Winter, the science writer [[Martin Gardner]] asserts that &quot;nothing could be clearer from the above dialogue than the fact that the dianetic explanation for the headache existed only in the mind of the therapist, and that it was with considerable difficulty that the patient was maneuvered into accepting it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, Martin. '' Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science''. Dover, 1957&lt;/ref&gt;

Other critics and medical experts have suggested that Dianetic auditing is a form of [[hypnosis]],&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Never believe a hypnotist - An investigation of L. Ron Hubbard's statements about hypnosis and its relationship to his Dianetics.&quot;, Jon Atack&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Psychologist says church appeared to use hypnosis&quot;, ''Irish Times'', 13 March 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The 'Scientology Organization' (SO) as of July 2003&quot;, chapter 2, Landesamt für Verfassungsschutz Baden-Wuerttemberg, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; although the Church of Scientology has strongly denied that hypnosis forms any part of Dianetics.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.scientology.org/en_US/news-media/faq/pg005.html What is auditing?]&quot;, Church of Scientology International&lt;/ref&gt; To the contrary, L. Ron Hubbard expressedly warns not to use any hypnosis or hypnosis-like methods, because a person under hypnosis would be receptive to suggestions. This would decrease his self-determinism instead of increasing it, which is one of the prime goals of Dianetics.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Science of Survival]]&quot;, L. Ron Hubbard, p. 461 (2007 edition).&lt;/ref&gt; Winter [1950] comments that the leading nature of the questions asked of a preclear &quot;encourage fantasy&quot;, a common issue also encountered with hypnosis, which can be used to form [[confabulation|false memories]]. The auditor is instructed not to make any assessment of a recalled memory's reality or accuracy, but instead to treat it as if it were objectively real. Professor [[Richard Ofshe|Richard J. Ofshe]], a leading expert on false memories, suggests that the feeling of well-being reported by preclears at the end of an auditing session may be induced by post-hypnotic [[suggestion]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;A Very Brief Overview of Scientology&quot;, Richard E. Ofshe, Ph.D.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Hubbard: &quot;Laughter is definitely the relief of painful emotion.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Dianetics: the Modern Science of Mental Health'', ibid. p. 147&lt;/ref&gt;

==Autocontrol==
According to Hubbard, the majority of the people interested in the subject believed they could accomplish therapy alone. &quot;It cannot be done&quot; and he adds: &quot;If a patient places himself in [[hypnosis#Self-hypnosis|autohypnosis]] and regresses himself in an effort to reach illness or birth or prenatals, the only thing he will get is ill&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Dianetics: the Modern Science of Mental Health -5oth anniversary edition- pp. 443-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''data warehouse''' ('''DW''') is a database used for reporting. The data is uploaded from the operational systems for reporting. The data may pass through an [[operational data store]] for additional operations before it is used in the DW for reporting.  

A data warehouse maintains its functions in three layers: staging, integration, and access. ''Staging'' is used to store raw data for use by developers (analysis and support). The ''integration'' layer is used to integrate data and to have a level of abstraction from users. The ''access'' layer is for getting data out for users.

This definition of the data warehouse focuses on data storage. The main source of the data is cleaned, transformed, catalogued and made available for use by managers and other business professionals for [[data mining]], [[OLAP|online analytical processing]], market research and decision support (Marakas &amp; OBrien 2009).  However, the means to retrieve and analyze data, to [[Extract, transform, load|extract, transform and load]] data, and to manage the [[data dictionary]] are also considered essential components of a data warehousing system. Many references to data warehousing use this broader context. Thus, an expanded definition for data warehousing includes [[business intelligence tools]], tools to extract, transform and load data into the repository, and tools to manage and retrieve [[metadata]].

==History==
The concept of data warehousing dates back to the late 1980s &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.computerworld.com/databasetopics/data/story/0,10801,70102,00.html|title=The Story So Far|date=2002-04-15|accessdate=2008-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; when IBM researchers Barry Devlin and Paul Murphy developed the &quot;business data warehouse&quot;. In essence, the data warehousing concept was intended to provide an architectural model for the flow of data from operational systems to [[decision support system|decision support environments]]. The concept attempted to address the various problems associated with this flow, mainly the high costs associated with it. In the absence of a data warehousing architecture, an enormous amount of redundancy was required to support multiple decision support environments. In larger corporations it was typical for multiple decision support environments to operate independently. Though each environment served different users, they often required much of the same stored data. The process of gathering, cleaning and integrating data from various sources, usually from long-term existing operational systems (usually referred to as [[legacy system]]s), was typically in part replicated for each environment. Moreover, the operational systems were frequently reexamined as new decision support requirements emerged. Often new requirements necessitated gathering, cleaning and integrating new data from &quot;[[data mart]]s&quot; that were tailored for ready access by users.

Key developments in early years of data warehousing were:

==Architecture==
; Operational database layer: The source data for the data warehouse&amp;nbsp;— An organization's [[Enterprise Resource Planning]] systems fall into this layer.
; Data access layer: The interface between the operational and informational access layer&amp;nbsp;— Tools to [[extract, transform, load]] data into the warehouse fall into this layer.
; Metadata layer: The [[data dictionary]]&amp;nbsp;— This is usually more detailed than an operational system data dictionary. There are dictionaries for the entire warehouse and sometimes dictionaries for the data that can be accessed by a particular reporting and analysis tool.
; Informational access layer: The data accessed for reporting and analyzing and the tools for reporting and analyzing data&amp;nbsp;— This is also called the [[data mart]]. [[Business intelligence]] tools fall into this layer. The Inmon-Kimball differences about design methodology, discussed later in this article, have to do with this layer

==Conforming information==
Another important fact in designing a data warehouse is which data to conform and how to conform the data. For example, one operational system feeding data into the data warehouse may use &quot;M&quot; and &quot;F&quot; to denote sex of an employee while another operational system may use &quot;Male&quot; and &quot;Female&quot;. Though this is a simple example, much of the work in implementing a data warehouse is devoted to making similar meaning data consistent when they are stored in the data warehouse. Typically, [[extract, transform, load]] tools are used in this work.

[[Master data management]] has the aim of conforming data that could be considered &quot;dimensions&quot;.

==Normalized versus dimensional approach for storage of data==
There are two leading approaches to storing data in a data warehouse&amp;nbsp;— the dimensional approach and the normalized approach.
The dimensional approach, whose supporters are referred to as “Kimballites”, believe in Ralph Kimball’s approach in which it is stated that the data warehouse should be modeled using a Dimensional Model/star schema. The normalized approach, also called the 3NF model, whose supporters are referred to as “Inmonites”, believe in Bill Inmon's approach in which it is stated that the data warehouse should be modeled using an E-R model/normalized model.

In a [[Star schema|dimensional approach]], transaction data are partitioned into either &quot;facts&quot;, which are generally numeric transaction data, or &quot;dimensions&quot;, which are the reference information that gives context to the facts. For example, a sales transaction can be broken up into facts such as the number of products ordered and the price paid for the products, and into dimensions such as order date, customer name, product number, order ship-to and bill-to locations, and salesperson responsible for receiving the order. 

A key advantage of a dimensional approach is that the data warehouse is easier for the user to understand and to use. Also, the retrieval of data from the data warehouse tends to operate very quickly. Dimensional structures are easy to understand for business users, because the structure is divided into measurements/facts and context/dimensions. Facts are related to the organization’s business processes and operational system whereas the dimensions surrounding them contain context about the measurement (Kimball, Ralph 2008). 

The main disadvantages of the dimensional approach are:
# In order to maintain the integrity of facts and dimensions, loading the data warehouse with data from different operational systems is complicated, and
# It is difficult to modify the data warehouse structure if the organization adopting the dimensional approach changes the way in which it does business.

In the normalized approach, the data in the data warehouse are stored following, to a degree, [[database normalization]] rules. Tables are grouped together by ''subject areas'' that reflect general data categories (e.g., data on customers, products, finance, etc.). The normalized structure divides data into entities, which creates several tables in a relational database. When applied in large enterprises the result is dozens of tables that are linked together by a web of joins. Furthermore, each of the created entities is converted into separate physical tables when the database is implemented (Kimball, Ralph 2008). 
The main advantage of this approach is that it is straightforward to add information into the database. A disadvantage of this approach is that, because of the number of tables involved, it can be difficult for users both to:
# join data from different sources into meaningful information and then
# access the information without a precise understanding of the sources of data and of the [[data structure]] of the data warehouse.

It should be noted that both normalized – and dimensional models can be represented in entity-relationship diagrams as both contain jointed relational tables. The difference between the two models is the degree of normalization. 

These approaches are not mutually exclusive, and there are other approaches. Dimensional approaches can involve normalizing data to a degree (Kimball, Ralph 2008).

==Top-down versus bottom-up design methodologies==
=== Bottom-up design ===
[[Ralph Kimball]], a well-known author on data warehousing,&lt;ref name=&quot;kimball310&quot;&gt;Kimball 2002, pg. 310&lt;/ref&gt; is a proponent of an approach to data warehouse design which he describes as ''bottom-up''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.intelligententerprise.com/030917/615warehouse1_1.jhtml|title=The Bottom-Up Misnomer|date=2003-09-17|accessdate=2008-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''bottom-up'' approach [[data mart]]s are first created to provide reporting and analytical capabilities for specific [[business process]]es. Though it is important to note that in Kimball methodology, the bottom-up process is the result of an initial business oriented Top-down analysis of the relevant business processes to be modelled.

Data marts contain, primarily, dimensions and facts. Facts can contain either atomic data and, if necessary, summarized data.
The single data mart often models a specific business area such as &quot;Sales&quot; or &quot;Production.&quot; These data marts can eventually be integrated to create a comprehensive data warehouse. The integration of data marts is managed through the implementation of what Kimball calls &quot;a data warehouse bus architecture&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ericsson28 9&quot;&gt;Ericsson 2004, pp. 28-29&lt;/ref&gt;
The data warehouse bus architecture is primarily an implementation of &quot;the bus&quot;, a collection of [[Dimension_(data_warehouse)#Types|conformed dimension]]s, which are dimensions that are shared (in a specific way) between facts in two or more data marts.

The integration of the data marts in the data warehouse is centered on the conformed dimensions (residing in &quot;the bus&quot;) that define the possible integration &quot;points&quot; between data marts. The actual integration of two or more data marts is then done by a process known as &quot;Drill across&quot;. A drill-across works by grouping (summarizing) the data along the keys of the (shared) conformed dimensions of each fact participating in the &quot;drill across&quot; followed by a join on the keys of these grouped (summarized) facts.

Maintaining tight management over the data warehouse bus architecture is fundamental to maintaining the integrity of the data warehouse. The most important management task is making sure dimensions among data marts are consistent. In Kimball's words, this means that the dimensions &quot;conform&quot;.

Some consider it an advantage of the Kimball method, that the data warehouse ends up being &quot;segmented&quot; into a number of logically self contained (up to and including The Bus) and consistent data marts, rather than a big and often complex centralized model.
Business value can be returned as quickly as the first [[data mart]]s can be created, and the method gives itself well to an exploratory and iterative approach to building data warehouses. For example, the data warehousing effort might start in the &quot;Sales&quot; department, by building a Sales-data mart. Upon completion of the Sales-data mart, The business might then decide to expand the warehousing activities into the, say, &quot;Production department&quot; resulting in a Production data mart.
The requirement for the Sales data mart and the Production data mart to be integrable, is that they share the same &quot;Bus&quot;, that will be, that the data warehousing team has made the effort to identify and implement the conformed dimensions in the bus, and that the individual data marts  links that information from the bus. Note that this does not require 100% awareness from the onset of the data warehousing effort, no master plan is required upfront. The Sales-data mart is good as it is (assuming that the bus is complete) and the production data mart can be constructed virtually independent of the sales data mart (but not independent of the Bus).

If integration via the bus is achieved, the data warehouse, through its two data marts, will not only be able to deliver  the specific information that the individual data marts are designed to do, in this example either &quot;Sales&quot; or &quot;Production&quot; information, but can deliver integrated Sales-Production information, which, often, is of critical business value. An integration (possibly) achieved in a flexible and iterative fashion.

===Top-down design===
[[Bill Inmon]], one of the first authors on the subject of data warehousing, has defined a data warehouse as a centralized repository for the entire enterprise.&lt;ref name=&quot;ericsson28 9&quot; /&gt; Inmon is one of the leading proponents of the ''top-down'' approach to data warehouse design, in which the data warehouse is designed using a normalized enterprise [[data model]]. [[Data element|&quot;Atomic&quot; data]], that is, data at the lowest level of detail, are stored in the data warehouse. Dimensional data marts containing data needed for specific business processes or specific departments are created from the data warehouse. In the Inmon vision the data warehouse is at the center of the &quot;Corporate Information Factory&quot; (CIF), which provides a logical framework for delivering business intelligence (BI) and business management capabilities.

Inmon states that the data warehouse is:
; Subject-oriented : The data in the data warehouse is organized so that all the data elements relating to the same real-world event or object are linked together.
; Non-volatile : Data in the data warehouse are never over-written or deleted&amp;nbsp;— once committed, the data are static, read-only, and retained for future reporting.
; Integrated : The data warehouse contains data from most or all of an organization's operational systems and these data are made consistent.
; Time-variant

The top-down design methodology generates highly consistent dimensional views of data across data marts since all data marts are loaded from the centralized repository. Top-down design has also proven to be robust against business changes. Generating new dimensional data marts against the data stored in the data warehouse is a relatively simple task. The main disadvantage to the top-down methodology is that it represents a very large project with a very broad scope. The up-front cost for implementing a data warehouse using the top-down methodology is significant, and the duration of time from the start of project to the point that end users experience initial benefits can be substantial. In addition, the top-down methodology can be inflexible and unresponsive to changing departmental needs during the implementation phases.&lt;ref name=&quot;ericsson28 9&quot; /&gt;

===Hybrid design===
Data warehouse (DW) solutions often resemble [[hub and spoke architecture]]. Legacy systems feeding the DW/BI solution often include [[customer relationship management]] (CRM) and [[enterprise resource planning]] solutions (ERP), generating large amounts of data. To consolidate these various data models, and facilitate the [[extract transform load]] (ETL) process, DW solutions often make use of an [[operational data store]] (ODS). The information from the ODS is then parsed into the actual DW. To reduce data redundancy, larger systems will often store the data in a normalized way. Data marts for specific reports can then be built on top of the DW solution. 

It is important to note that the DW database in a hybrid solution is kept on third normal form to eliminate data redundancy. A normal relational database however, is not efficient for business intelligence reports where dimensional modelling is prevalent. Small data marts can shop for data from the consolidated warehouse and use the filtered, specific data for the fact tables and dimensions required. 
The DW effectively provides a single source of information from which the data marts can read from, creating a highly flexible solution from a BI point of view. The hybrid architecture allows a DW to be replaced with a [[master data management]] solution where operational, not static information could reside.

The Data Vault Modeling components follow [[hub and spoke architecture]].  This modeling style is a hybrid design, consisting of the best of breed practices from both 3rd normal form and star schema.  The Data Vault model is not a true 3rd normal form, and breaks some of the rules that 3NF dictates be followed.  It is however, a top-down architecture with a bottom up design.  The Data Vault model is geared to be strictly a data warehouse.  It is not geared to be end-user accessible, which when built, still requires the use of a data mart or star schema based release area for business purposes.

==Data warehouses versus operational systems==
Operational systems are optimized for preservation of [[data integrity]] and speed of recording of business transactions through use of [[database normalization]] and an [[entity-relationship model]]. Operational system designers generally follow the [[Edgar F. Codd|Codd]] rules of [[database normalization]] in order to ensure data integrity. Codd defined five increasingly stringent rules of normalization.Fully normalized database designs (that is, those satisfying all five Codd rules) often result in information from a business transaction being stored in dozens to hundreds of tables. [[Relational database]]s are efficient at managing the relationships between these tables. The databases have very fast insert/update performance because only a small amount of data in those tables is affected each time a transaction is processed. Finally, in order to improve performance, older data are usually periodically purged from operational systems.

Data warehouses are optimized for speed of data analysis. Frequently data in data warehouses are [[denormalization|denormalised]] via a [[star schema|dimension-based model]]. Also, to speed data retrieval, data warehouse data are often stored multiple times—in their most granular form and in summarized forms called aggregates. Data warehouse data are gathered from the operational systems and held in the data warehouse even after the data has been purged from the operational systems.

==Evolution in organization use==
These terms refer to the level of sophistication of a data warehouse:

; Offline operational data warehouse: Data warehouses in this initial stage are developed by simply copying the data off of an operational system to another server where the processing load of reporting against the copied data does not impact the operational system's performance.
; Offline data warehouse : Data warehouses at this stage are updated from data in the operational systems on a regular basis and the data warehouse data are stored in a data structure designed to facilitate reporting.
; Real-time data warehouse : Data warehouses at this stage are updated every time an operational system performs a transaction (e.g. an order or a delivery or a booking).
; Integrated data warehouse : These data warehouses assemble data from different areas of business, so users can look up the information they need across other systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tech-faq.com/data-warehouse.html |title=Data Warehouse }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits==
Some of the benefits that a data warehouse provides are as follows:&lt;ref name=&quot;WHIPSAdvantages&quot;&gt;Yang, Jun. ''WareHouse Information Prototype at Stanford (WHIPS)''. [http://infolab.stanford.edu/warehousing/warehouse.html]. Stanford University. July 7, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ISBN 9789726184799&quot;&gt;Caldeira, C. &quot;Data Warehousing&amp;nbsp;— Conceitos e Modelos&quot;. Edições Sílabo. 2008. ISBN 978-972-618-479-9&lt;/ref&gt;

* A data warehouse provides a common data model for all data of interest regardless of the data's source. This makes it easier to report and analyze information than it would be if multiple data models were used to retrieve information such as sales invoices, order receipts, general ledger charges, etc.
* Prior to loading data into the data warehouse, inconsistencies are identified and resolved. This greatly simplifies reporting and analysis.
* Information in the data warehouse is under the control of data warehouse users so that, even if the source system data are purged over time, the information in the warehouse can be stored safely for extended periods of time.
* Because they are separate from [[operational system]]s, data warehouses provide retrieval of data without slowing down operational systems.
* Data warehouses can work in conjunction with and, hence, enhance the value of operational business applications, notably [[customer relationship management]] (CRM) systems.
* Data warehouses facilitate decision support system applications such as trend reports (e.g., the items with the most sales in a particular area within the last two years), exception reports, and reports that show actual performance versus goals.
* Data warehouses can record historical information for data source tables that are not set up to save an update history.

==Sample applications==
Some of the applications data warehousing can be used for are:
* Decision support
* Trend analysis
* Financial forecasting
* [[churn rate|Churn]] Prediction for Telecom subscribers, Credit Card users etc.
* Insurance fraud analysis
* Call record analysis
* Logistics and Inventory management
* Agriculture &lt;ref name=&quot;ahsan&quot; /&gt;

==Future==
Data warehousing, like any technology, has a history of innovations that did not receive market acceptance.&lt;ref&gt;Pendse, Nigel and Bange, Carsten &quot;The Missing Next Big Things&quot;, http://www.olapreport.com/Faileddozen.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2009 Gartner Group paper predicted these developments in business intelligence/data warehousing market.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Gartner Reveals Five Business Intelligence Predictions for 2009 and Beyond&quot;, http://www.gartner.com/it/page.jsp?id=856714&lt;/ref&gt;
* Because of lack of information, processes, and tools, through 2012, more than 35 percent of the top 5,000 global companies will regularly fail to make insightful decisions about significant changes in their business and markets.
* By 2012, [[business unit]]s will control at least 40 percent of the total budget for business intelligence.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}
* By 2010, 20 percent of organizations will have an industry-specific analytic application delivered via [[software as a service]] as a standard component of their business intelligence portfolio.
* In 2009, [[Group decision making|collaborative decision making]] will emerge as a new product category that combines [[social software]] with business intelligence platform capabilities.
* By 2012, one-third of analytic applications applied to business processes will be delivered through [[Granularity|coarse-grained]] application [[mashup (web application hybrid)|mashups]].

P. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Where an extractor requires that every event gets the same [[probability]] under the [[Continuous uniform distribution|uniform distribution]] and the extracted distribution, only the latter is required for a disperser. So for a disperser, an event &lt;math&gt;A \subseteq \{0,1\}^{m}&lt;/math&gt; we have:
&lt;math&gt;Pr_{U_{m}}[A] &gt; 1 - \epsilon&lt;/math&gt;

An '''(''N'', ''M'', ''D'', ''K'', ''e'')-disperser''' is a [[bipartite graph]] with ''N'' vertices on the left side, each with degree ''D'', and ''M'' vertices on the right side, such that every [[subset]] of ''K'' vertices on the left side is connected to more than (1&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''e'')''M'' vertices on the right.

An [[Extractor (mathematics)|extractor]] is a related type of graph that guarantees an even stronger property; every '''(''N'', ''M'', ''D'', ''K'', ''e'')-extractor''' is also an '''(''N'', ''M'', ''D'', ''K'', ''e'')-disperser'''.

The '''Devonian''' is a [[geologic period|geologic period and system]] of the [[Paleozoic]] Era spanning from {{Ma|416|359.2}} {{ICS 2004}}.  It is named after [[Devon]], [[England]], where rocks from this period were first studied.

During the Devonian Period the pectoral and pelvic fins of [[lobe-finned fish]] evolved into [[Leg (anatomy)|legs]]&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Tiktaalik]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; as they started to walk on [[Landform|land]] as [[tetrapod]]s around 397 [[Mega-annum|Ma]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/8443879.stm] Fossil tracks record 'oldest land-walkers' - BBC News&lt;/ref&gt; Various terrestrial [[arthropod]]s also became well-established.&lt;!--Arthropods had been on the land since the Silu/Ordovican. See Tumblagooda sandstone.--&gt;

The first [[Spermatophyte|seed-bearing plants]] spread across dry land, forming huge [[forest]]s. In the [[ocean]]s, primitive [[shark]]s became more numerous than in the [[Silurian]] and the [[late Ordovician]], and the first [[Actinopterygii|ray finned]] and [[Sarcopterygii|lobe-finned]] [[bony fish]] evolved. The first [[ammonite]] [[mollusk]]s appeared, and [[trilobite]]s, the mollusc-like [[brachiopod]]s, as well as great [[coral reef]]s were still common. The [[Late Devonian extinction]] severely affected marine life.

The [[paleogeography]] was dominated by the [[supercontinent]] of [[Gondwana]] to the south, the [[continent]] of [[Siberia (continent)|Siberia]] to the north, and the early formation of the small supercontinent of [[Euramerica]] in between.

== History ==
The period is named after [[Devon]], a county in southwestern England, where Devonian outcrops are common. While the [[stratum|rock bed]]s that define the start and end of the period are well identified, the exact dates are uncertain. According to the [[International Commission on Stratigraphy]] ([[#References|Ogg, 2004]]), the Devonian extends from the end of the [[Silurian]] Period 416.0 ± 2.8 [[annum|Mya]], to the beginning of the [[Carboniferous]] Period 359.9 ± 2.5 Mya (in [[North America]], the beginning of the [[Mississippian]] subperiod of the Carboniferous) (ICS 2004).

In nineteenth-century texts the Devonian has been called the &quot;Old Red Age&quot;, after the red and brown terrestrial deposits known in the United Kingdom as the [[Old Red Sandstone]] in which early fossil  discoveries were found. Another common term is &quot;Age of the Fishes&quot;, referring to the evolution of several major groups of [[fish]] that took place during the period.  Older literature on the Anglo-Welsh basin divides it into the Downtonian, Dittonian, Breconian and Farlovian stages, the latter three of which are place in the Devonian.&lt;ref&gt;Barclay, W.J. 1989. ''Geology of the South Wales Coalfield Pt II, the country around Abergavenny'', 3rd edn. Memoir of the British Geological Survey Sheet 232 (Eng &amp; Wales) pp18-19&lt;/ref&gt;

The Devonian has also erroneously been characterized as a &quot;greenhouse age&quot;, due to [[sampling bias]]: most of the early Devonian-age discoveries came from the [[stratum|strata]] of [[western Europe]] and eastern [[North America]], which at the time straddled the [[Equator]] as part of the supercontinent of Euramerica where [[fossil]] signatures of widespread reefs indicate  tropical  [[climate]]s that were warm and moderately humid but in fact the climate in the Devonian differed greatly between [[Geologic time scale|epoch]]s and geographic regions. For example, during the [[Early Devonian]], arid conditions were prevalent through much of the world including Siberia, Australia, North America, and China, but Africa and [[South America]] had a warm [[temperate climate]]. In the [[Late Devonian]], by contrast, arid conditions were less prevalent across the world and [[temperate]] climates were more common.

== Subdivisions{{anchor|subdivisions}} ==
{{include timeline}}
The Devonian Period is formally broken into Early, Middle, and Late subdivisions. The rocks corresponding to these [[series (stratigraphy)|epoch]]s are referred to as belonging to the Lower, Middle and Upper parts of the Devonian System.

The Early Devonian lasts from {{period span|Early devonian}} and begins with the Lochkovian stage, which lasts until the Pragian.  This spans from {{period span|Pragian}}, and is followed by the Emsian, which lasts until the Middle Devonian begins, {{ma|middle devonian|error=show}}.
The Middle Devonian comprises two subdivisions, the Eifelian giving way to the Givetian {{Mya|Givetian|error=show}}.
During this time the armoured jawless [[ostracoderm]] fish were declining in diversity; the jawed fish were thriving and increasing in diversity in both the oceans and freshwater. The shallow, warm, oxygen-depleted waters of Devonian inland lakes, surrounded by primitive plants, provided the environment necessary for certain early fish to develop essential characteristics such as well developed lungs, and the ability to crawl out of the water and onto the land for short periods of time.

Finally, the Late Devonian starts with the Frasnian, {{period span|Frasnian}}, during which the first forests were taking shape on land.  The first tetrapods appear in the fossil record in the ensuing Famennian subdivision, the beginning and end of which are marked with extinction events. This lasted until the end of the Devonian, {{Mya|Carboniferous|error=show}}.

== Climate ==
The Devonian was a relatively warm period, and probably lacked any glaciers.&lt;ref name=Joachimskia2009/&gt;  Reconstruction of tropical sea surface temperature from [[conodont]] [[apatite]] implies an average value of {{convert|30|C|F|0|abbr=on}} in the Early Devonian.&lt;ref name=Joachimskia2009/&gt;  {{Co2}} levels dropped steeply throughout the Devonian period as the burial of the newly-evolved forests drew carbon out of the atmosphere into sediments; this may be reflected by a Mid-Devonian cooling of around {{convert|5|C-change|F-change|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=Joachimskia2009/&gt;  The Late Devonian warmed to levels equivalent to the Early Devonian; while there is no corresponding increase in {{co2}} concentrations, continental weathering increases (as predicted by warmer temperatures); further, a range of evidence, such as plant distribution, points to Late Devonian warming.&lt;ref name=Joachimskia2009&gt;{{cite doi|10.1016/j.epsl.2009.05.028}} - [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=MiamiCaptionURL&amp;_method=retrieve&amp;_udi=B6V61-4WJG8RT-3&amp;_image=fig7&amp;_ba=7&amp;_user=994540&amp;_coverDate=06%2F18%2F2009&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=full&amp;_orig=search&amp;_cdi=5801&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000050024&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=994540&amp;md5=c2a44da1f24f5dbcd2fca38aa1e133ac Graph of palaeotemperature from Conodont apatite]&lt;/ref&gt;  The climate would have affected the dominant organisms in [[reefs]]; [[microbes]] would have been the main reef-forming organisms in warm periods, with corals and [[stromatoporoid]] sponges taking the dominant role in cooler times.  The warming at the end of the Devonian may even have contributed to the extinction of the stromatoporoids.

The Devonian period was a time of great [[Plate tectonics|tectonic]] activity, as [[Euramerica]] and [[Gondwana]]land drew closer together.

The continent [[Euramerica]] (or Laurussia) was created in the early Devonian by the collision of [[Laurentia]] and [[Baltica]], which rotated into the natural dry zone along the [[Tropic of Capricorn]], which is formed as much in Paleozoic times as nowadays by the convergence of two great air-masses, the [[Hadley cell]] and the [[Ferrel cell]]. In these near-deserts, the [[Old Red Sandstone]] sedimentary beds formed, made red by the oxidized iron ([[hematite]]) characteristic of drought conditions.

Near the [[equator]], the [[Tectonic plates|plate]] of Euramerica and Gondwana were starting to meet, beginning the early stages of assembling [[Pangaea]]. This activity further raised the northern [[Appalachian Mountains]] and formed the [[Caledonian orogeny|Caledonian Mountains]] in [[Great Britain]] and [[Scandinavia]].

The west coast of Devonian North America, by contrast, was a passive margin with deep silty embayments, river deltas and estuaries, in today's [[Idaho]] and [[Nevada]]; an approaching volcanic [[island arc]] reached the steep slope of the continental shelf in Late Devonian times and began to uplift deep water deposits, a collision that was the prelude to the mountain-building episode of Mississippian times called the [[Antler orogeny]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://jan.ucc.nau.edu/~rcb7/devpaleo.html Devonian Paleogeography&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sea levels were high worldwide, and much of the land lay submerged under shallow seas, where tropical [[reef]] organisms lived. The deep, enormous [[Panthalassa]] (the &quot;universal ocean&quot;) covered the rest of the [[planet]]. Other minor oceans were [[Paleo-Tethys]], [[Proto-Tethys]], [[Rheic Ocean]], and [[Ural Ocean]] (which was closed during the collision with [[Siberia (continent)|Siberia]] and Baltica).

== Biota ==
=== Marine biota ===
Sea levels in the Devonian were generally high. Marine faunas continued to be dominated by [[bryozoa]], diverse and abundant [[brachiopoda|brachiopods]], the enigmatic [[hederellid|hederelloids]], [[microconchids]] and [[coral]]s. Lily-like [[crinoids]] were abundant, and [[trilobite]]s were still fairly common. Among vertebrates, jaw-less armored fish ([[ostracoderms]]) declined in diversity, while the jawed fish (gnathostomes) simultaneously increased in both the sea and [[fresh water]]. Armored [[placoderms]] were numerous during the lower stages of the Devonian Period and became extinct in the Late Devonian, perhaps because of competition for food against the other fish species. Early cartilaginous ([[Chondrichthyes]]) and bony fishes ([[Osteichthyes]]) also become diverse and played a large role within the Devonian seas. The first abundant genus of shark,  ''[[Cladoselache]]'', appeared in the oceans during the Devonian Period. The great diversity of fish around at the time, have led to the Devonian being given the name &quot;The Age of Fish&quot; in popular culture.

The first [[ammonite]]s also appeared during or slightly before the early Devonian Period around 400 [[annum|Mya]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.palaeos.com/Paleozoic/Devonian/Devonian.2.htm#Life Palaeos Paleozoic: Devonian: The Devonian Period - 2&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;

=== Reefs ===
A now dry barrier reef, located in present day [[Kimberley Basin]] of northwest [[Australia]], once extended a thousand kilometers, fringing a Devonian continent. Reefs in general are built by various [[carbonate]]-secreting organisms that have the ability to erect wave-resistant frameworks close to sea level. The main contributors of the Devonian reefs were unlike modern reefs, which are constructed mainly by corals and calcareous [[algae]]. They were composed of calcareous algae and coral-like [[Stromatoporoidea|stromatoporoids]], and tabulate and [[Rugosa|rugose corals]], in that order of importance.{{Clarify|reason= Difference between  &quot;corals and calcareous [[algae]]&quot; and &quot;calcareous algae and coral-like [[Stromatoporoidea|stromatoporoids]] [and corals]&quot;|date=December 2010}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

=== Terrestrial biota ===
By the Devonian Period, life was well underway in its colonization of the land. The [[moss]] forests and [[bacteria]]l and algal mats of the [[Silurian]] were joined early in the period by primitive rooted [[plant]]s that created the first stable [[soil]]s and harbored arthropods like [[mite]]s, [[scorpion]]s and [[myriapod]]s (although arthropods appeared on land much earlier than in the [[Early Devonian]] and the existence of fossils such as ''[[Climactichnites]]'' suggest that land arthropods may have appeared as early as the [[Cambrian]] period). Also the first possible fossils of [[insects]] appeared around 416 [[Mega-annum|Mya]] in the Early Devonian. The first [[tetrapods]] evolving from [[lobe-finned fish]], appeared in the coastal water no later than middle Devonian, and give rise to the first Amphibians.&lt;ref&gt;Niedźwiedzki &amp; al. (2010): Tetrapod trackways from the early Middle Devonian period of Poland. ''[[Nature]]'' no 463, pp 43-48 DOI: 10.1038/&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The greening of land ====
[[Image:Devonianscene-green.jpg|thumb|275px|The Devonian period marks the beginning of extensive land colonization by [[plant]]s. With large [[herbivorous]] land-animals not yet being present, large forests could grow and shape the landscape.]]
[[Early Devonian]] plants did not have roots or leaves like the plants most common today, and many had no vascular tissue at all. They probably spread largely by vegetative growth, and did not grow much more than a few centimeters tall. By far the greatest land organism was ''[[Prototaxites]]'', the fruiting body of an enormous fungus that stood more than 8 meters tall, towering over the low, carpet-like vegetation. By [[Middle Devonian]], shrub-like forests of primitive plants existed: [[lycophyte]]s, [[horsetails]], [[fern]]s, and progymnosperms had [[Evolution|evolved]]. Most of these plants had true roots and leaves, and many were quite tall. The earliest known trees, from the genus ''[[Wattieza]]'', appeared in the Late Devonian around 380 [[Mega-annum|Ma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/science/article1674051.ece | work=The Times | location=London | title=Fossil from a forest that gave Earth its breath of fresh air | first=Lewis | last=Smith | date=April 19, 2007 | accessdate=May 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Late Devonian]], the tree-like ancestral fern ''[[Archaeopteris]]'' and the giant [[cladoxylopsid]] trees grew&lt;ref&gt;C.Michael Hogan. 2010.

Washington DC.&lt;/ref&gt; with true [[wood]]. (See also: [[lignin]].) These are the oldest known trees of the world's first forests. By the end of the Devonian, the first seed-forming plants had appeared. This rapid appearance of so many plant groups and growth forms has been called the &quot;Devonian Explosion&quot;.

The 'greening' of the continents{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} acted as a [[carbon dioxide]] [[Carbon dioxide sink|sink]], and [[Earth's atmosphere|atmospheric]] levels of this [[greenhouse gas]] may have dropped. This may have cooled the climate and led to a massive [[extinction event]]. See [[Late Devonian extinction]].

==== Animals and the first soils ====
Primitive arthropods co-evolved with this diversified terrestrial vegetation structure. The evolving co-dependence of insects and seed-plants that characterizes a recognizably modern world had its genesis in the Late Devonian. The development of soils and plant root systems probably led to changes in the speed and pattern of [[erosion]] and sediment deposition. The rapid evolution of a terrestrial ecosystem containing copious animals opened the way for the first [[vertebrate]]s to seek out a terrestrial living. By the end of the Devonian, arthropods were solidly established on the land.

== Late Devonian extinction ==
[[Image:Extinction Intensity.svg|thumb|The Late Devonian is characterised by three episodes of extinction (&quot;Late D&quot;)]]
{{Main|Late Devonian extinction}}

A major extinction occurred at the beginning of the last phase of the Devonian period, the Famennian faunal stage, (the Frasnian-Famennian boundary), about 364 Mya, when all the fossil [[agnathan]] fishes, save for the [[psammosteid]] [[heterostracan]]s, suddenly disappeared. A second strong pulse closed the Devonian period. The Late Devonian extinction was one of five major extinction events in the history of the Earth's biota, more drastic than the familiar extinction event that closed the Cretaceous.

The Devonian extinction crisis primarily affected the marine community, and selectively affected shallow warm-water organisms rather than cool-water organisms. The most important group to be affected by this extinction event were the reef-builders of the great Devonian reef-systems .

Amongst the severely affected marine groups were the [[brachiopod]]s, trilobites, [[ammonite]]s, [[conodont]]s, and [[acritarch]]s, as well as jawless fish, and all placoderms. Land plants as well as freshwater species, such as our tetrapod ancestors, were relatively unaffected by the Late Devonian extinction event.

The reasons for the Late Devonian extinctions are still unknown, and all explanations remain speculative. [[Canada|Canadian]] [[paleontologist]] [[Digby McLaren]] suggested in 1969 that the Devonian extinction events were caused by an asteroid impact. However, while there were Late Devonian collision events (see the [[Alamo bolide impact]]), little evidence supports the existence of a Devonian crater large enough.

'''David Thompson''' (April 30, 1770 – February 10, 1857) was an [[English-Canadian]] fur trader, surveyor, and map-maker, known to some native peoples as &quot;Koo-Koo-Sint&quot; or &quot;the Stargazer&quot;. Over his career he mapped over 3.9 million square kilometers of North America and for this has been described as the &quot;greatest land geographer who ever lived.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;tyrell&quot;/&gt;

==Biography==
===Early life===
Thompson was born in [[Westminster]] to recent [[Wales|Welsh]] migrants, David and Ann Thompson. When Thompson was two, his father died and the financial hardship of this occurrence resulted in his and his brother's placement in the [[Grey Coat Hospital]], a school for the disadvantaged of Westminster. He eventually graduated to the Grey Coat mathematical school and was introduced to basic navigation skills which would form the basis of his future career. In 1784, at the age of 14, he entered a seven-year apprenticeship with the [[Hudson's Bay Company]]. He set sail on May 28 of that year, and left England forever.&lt;ref name=&quot;vanherk&quot;&gt;Aritha Van Herk, ''Travels with Charlotte'', Canadian Geographic Magazine, July/August 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Hudson's Bay Company (HBC)===
He arrived in [[Churchill, Manitoba|Churchill]] (now in [[Manitoba]]) and was put to work copying the personal papers of the governor of Fort Churchill, [[Samuel Hearne]]. The next year he was transferred to nearby [[York Factory, Manitoba|York Factory]], and over the next few years spent time as a clerk at Cumberland House and South Branch House before arriving at Manchester House in 1787. On December 23, 1788, Thompson seriously fractured his leg, forcing him to spend the next two winters at Cumberland House convalescing. It was during this time he greatly refined and expanded his mathematical, astronomical and surveying skills under the tutelage of Hudson's Bay Company surveyor [[Philip Turnor]]. It was also during this time that he lost sight in his right eye &lt;ref name=&quot;gottfred&quot;&gt;J. &amp; A. Gottfred, &quot;Art. I. The Life of David Thompson&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1790 with his apprenticeship nearing its end, Thompson made the unusual request of a set of surveying tools in place of the typical parting gift of fine clothes offered by the company to those completing their indenture. He received both. He then entered the employ of the Hudson's Bay Company as a fur trader and in 1792 completed his first significant survey, mapping a route to [[Lake Athabasca]] (presently straddling the [[Alberta]]/[[Saskatchewan]] border). In recognition of his map-making skills, the company promoted him to surveyor in 1794. Thompson continued working for the Hudson's Bay Company until May 23, 1797 when, frustrated with the Hudson's Bay Company's policies, he left and walked 80 miles in the snow to enter the employ of the competition, the [[North West Company]] where he continued to work as a fur trader and surveyor.

===North West Company===
 [[Image:David Thompson (explorer).jpg|thumb|200px|An artist's impression of Thompson based on historical accounts]]Thompson's decision to defect to the [[North West Company]] in 1797 without providing the customary one-year notice was not well received by his former employers. However, joining the North West Company allowed Thompson to pursue his interest in surveying and work on mapping the interior of what was to become Canada. In 1797, Thompson was sent south by his employers to survey part of Canada-U.S. boundary along the water routes from [[Lake Superior]] to [[Lake of the Woods]] to satisfy unresolved questions of territory arising from the [[Jay Treaty]] between [[Great Britain]] and the [[United States]]. By 1798 Thompson had completed a survey of {{convert|6750|km|mi|abbr=on|lk=off}} from Grand Portage, through Lake Winnipeg, to the headwaters of the [[Assiniboine River|Assiniboine]] and [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] Rivers, as well as two sides of Lake Superior.&lt;ref name=&quot;vanherk&quot;/&gt; In 1798, the company sent him to [[Red Deer Lake (Alberta)|Red Deer Lake]] (in present-day [[Alberta]]) to establish a trading post. Thompson spent the next few seasons trading based in Fort George (now in Alberta), and during this time led several expeditions into the [[Rocky Mountains]].

In 1804, at the annual meeting of the North West Company in [[Fort Kaministiquia|Kaministiquia]], Thompson was made a full partner of the company and spent the next few seasons based there managing the fur trading operations but still finding time to expand his surveys of the waterways around [[Lake Superior]]. However, a decision was made at the 1806 company meeting to send Thompson back out into the interior. Concern over the [[United States|American]]-backed expedition of [[Lewis and Clark Expedition|Lewis and Clark]] prompted the North West Company to charge Thompson with the task of finding a route to the [[Pacific]] in order to open up the lucrative trading territories of the [[Pacific Northwest]].

===Columbia travels===
After the general meeting in 1806, Thompson travelled to [[Rocky Mountain House]] and prepared for an expedition to follow the [[Columbia River]] to the Pacific. In June 1807 Thompson crossed the Rocky Mountains and spent the summer surveying the Columbia basin and continuing to survey the area over the next few seasons. Thompson mapped and established trading posts in Northwestern [[Montana]], [[Idaho]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], and Western Canada; including [[Kootenae House]] and [[Saleesh House]]; the first trading post west of the Rockies in Montana extending North West Company fur trading territories. The maps he made of the Columbia River basin east of the [[Cascade Mountains]] were of such high quality and detail that they continued to be regarded as authoritative well into the mid-20th century. in fact, Thompson’s drawings of the upper portion of the Missouri River were incorporated into a map for the Lewis and Clark expedition that followed seven years later.[[Image:Columbiarivermap.png|thumb|400px|David Thompson navigated the entire length of Columbia River in 1811. Map of Columbia and its tributaries showing modern political boundaries]]

In early 1810, Thompson was returning eastward towards [[Montreal]] but while on route at [[Rainy Lake]], received orders to return to the Rocky Mountains and establish a route to the mouth of the Columbia. This was a response by the North West Company to the plans of [[John Jacob Astor]] to send a ship around the Americas to establish a fur trading post. During his return, Thompson was delayed by an angry group of [[Peigan]] natives which ultimately forced him to seek a new route across the Rocky Mountains through the [[Athabasca Pass]].

David Thompson was the first European to navigate the full length of the Columbia River. During Thompson's 1811 voyage down the Columbia River he camped at the junction with the [[Snake River]] on July 9, 1811, and erected a pole and a notice claiming the country for Great Britain and stating the intention of the North West Company to build a trading post at the site. This notice was found later that year by Astorians looking to establish an inland fur post, contributing to their selection of a more northerly site at [[Fort Okanogan]]. The North West Company's [[Fort Nez Percés]] was established near the Snake River junction several years later. Continuing down the Columbia, Thompson passed the barrier of [[The Dalles, Oregon|The Dalles]] with much less difficulty than experienced by [[Lewis and Clark Expedition|Lewis and Clark]], as high water obscured [[Celilo Falls]] and many of the rapids. On July 14, 1811, Thompson reached the partially constructed [[Fort Astoria]] at the mouth of the Columbia, arriving two months after the [[Pacific Fur Company]]'s ship, the ''[[Tonquin]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Meinig |first= D.W. |authorlink= D.W. Meinig |title= The Great Columbia Plain |origyear= 1968 |edition= Weyerhaeuser Environmental Classic edition |year= 1995 |publisher= University of Washington Press |isbn= 0-295-97485-0 |pages= 37–38, 50}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Before returning upriver and across the mountains, Thompson hired [[Naukane]], a [[Native Hawaiians|Native Hawaiian]] laborer brought to Fort Astoria by the Pacific Fur Company's ship ''Tonquin''. Naukane, known as Coxe to Thompson, accompanied Thompson across the continent to [[Lake Superior]] before journeying on to [[England]]. 

Thompson wintered at Saleesh House before beginning his final journey back to Montreal in 1812.

In his published journals, Thompson recorded seeing large footprints near what is now [[Jasper, Alberta]], in 1811. It has been suggested that these prints were similar to what has since been called the [[sasquatch]]. However, Thompson noted that these tracks showed &quot;a small Nail at the end of each [toe]&quot;, and stated that these tracks &quot;very much resembles a large Bear's Track&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, David. ''Columbia Journals''. Edited by Barbara Belyea. McGill-Queen's University Press, 1994, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marriage and children===
He married [[Charlotte Small]] on June 10, 1799 at [[Île-à-la-Crosse, Saskatchewan|Île-à-la-Crosse]], a mixed-blood child of a Scottish fur trader and a [[Cree]] mother. Their marriage was formalized at the Scotch Presbyterian Church in [[Montreal]] on October 30, 1812. He and Charlotte had 13 children together; five of them were born before he left the fur trade. The family did not adjust easily to life in Eastern Canada and two of the children, John (aged 5) and Emma (aged 7) died of round worms, a common parasite.&lt;ref name=&quot;vanherk&quot;/&gt; Their marriage lasted 58 years, the longest Canadian pre-Confederation marriage known.&lt;ref name=&quot;vanherk&quot;/&gt;

===Later years===
Upon his arrival back in [[Montreal]], Thompson retired with a generous pension from the [[North West Company]]. He settled in nearby [[Terrebonne, Quebec|Terrebonne]] and worked on completing his great map, a summary of his lifetime of exploring and surveying the interior of North America. The map covered the wide area stretching from [[Lake Superior]] to the [[Pacific]], and was given by Thompson to the North West Company. Thompson's 1814 map, his greatest achievement, was so accurate that 100 years later it was still the basis for many of the maps issued by the Canadian government. It now resides in the Archives of Ontario.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archives.gov.on.ca/english/exhibits/thompson/records.htm David Thompson Records Held by the [[Archives of Ontario]]&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1815, Thompson moved his family to [[Williamstown, Ontario|Williamstown, Upper Canada]] and a few years later was employed to survey the newly established borders with the [[United States]] from [[Lake of the Woods]] to the [[Eastern Townships]] of [[Quebec]], established by [[Treaty of Ghent]] after the [[War of 1812]]. In 1843 Thompson completed his atlas of the region from [[Hudson Bay]] to the Pacific Ocean. 

Afterwards, Thompson returned to a life as a land owner, but soon financial misfortune would ruin him. By 1831 he was so deeply in debt he was forced to take up a position as a surveyor for the British American Land Company to provide for his family. His luck continued to worsen and he was forced to move in with this daughter and son-in-law in 1845. He began work on a manuscript chronicling his life exploring the continent, but this project was left unfinished when his sight failed him completely in 1851.

===Death and afterward===
[[Image:Stamp-Thompson-1957.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Postage stamp commemorating David Thompson's life]]
The land mass mapped by Thompson amounted to 3.9 million square kilometres of wilderness (one-fifth of the continent). His contemporary, the great explorer [[Alexander Mackenzie (explorer)|Alexander Mackenzie]], remarked that Thompson did more in ten months than he would have thought possible in two years.

Despite these significant achievements, Thompson died in Montreal in near obscurity on February 10, 1857, his accomplishments almost unrecognized. He never finished the book of his 28 years in the fur trade, based on his 77 field notebooks, before he died. In the 1890s geologist [[Joseph Tyrrell|J.B. Tyrrell]] resurrected Thompson's notes and in 1916 published them as ''David Thompson's Narrative''.&lt;ref&gt;Rick Boychuk, ''David Thompson's living legacy'', Canadian Geographic Magazine, July/August 2007, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

Thompson's body was interred in Montreal's [[Mount Royal Cemetery]] in an unmarked grave. It was not until 1926 that efforts by [[Joseph Tyrrell|J.B. Tyrell]] and the Canadian Historical Society resulted in the placing of a tombstone to mark his grave. 

In 1957, one hundred years after his death, the Canadian government honoured him with his image on a [[List of people on stamps of Canada|Canadian postage stamp]]. The [[David Thompson Highway]] in [[Alberta]] was named in his honour, along with David Thompson High School situated on the side of the highway near [[Leslieville, Alberta]]. His prowess as a geographer is now well-recognized. He has been called &quot;the greatest land geographer who ever lived.&quot;&lt;ref name=tyrell&gt;''[http://link.library.utoronto.ca/champlain/item_record.cfm?Idno=9_96855&amp;lang=eng&amp;query=thompson%20AND%20david&amp;searchtype=Author&amp;startrow=1&amp;Limit=All David Thompson's narrative of his explorations in western America, 1784–1812]'' (edited by J.B.

[[Image:LLB Thompson statue.jpg|thumb|right|200px|David Thompson and two guides on the shore of [[Lac la Biche (Alberta)|Lac la Biche]], which he discovered, in [[Lac La Biche, Alberta]].]]
There is a monument dedicated to David Thompson (maintained by the state of [[North Dakota]]) near the former town site of the ghost town, [[Verendrye, North Dakota]], located approximately two miles north and one mile west of [[Karlsruhe, North Dakota]]. [[Thompson Falls, Montana]] and British Columbia's [[Thompson River]] are also named after the explorer.

The year 2007 marked the 150th year of Thompson's death and the 200th anniversary of his first crossing of the Rocky Mountains. Commemorative events and exhibits are planned across Canada and the United States from 2007 to 2011 as a celebration of his accomplishments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.davidthompson200.org/ David Thompson Bicentennials&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dioscoreales''' is a [[botanical name]] for an order of [[flowering plants]].  Of necessity it contains the family [[Dioscoreaceae]].

In the [[APG II system]], of 2003, this order was placed in the clade [[monocots]] and comprised the families [[Burmanniaceae]], [[Dioscoreaceae]] and [[Nartheciaceae]].

Under the [[APG system]] of 1998, the order was placed in the clade monocots and comprised the families Burmanniaceae, Dioscoreaceae, [[Taccaceae]], [[Thismiaceae]] and [[Trichopodaceae]]

In APG II, the family Thismiaceae has been included in family Burmanniaceae and the families Taccaceae and Trichopodaceae have been included in family Dioscoreaceae. Therefore the change is not as large as might appear, and the only plants to have moved across the borders of the order are those belonging to family Nartheciaceae.

The [[Cronquist system]], of 1981, did not recognise such an order, but placed most such plants in order [[Liliales]] in subclass [[Liliidae]] in class [[Liliopsida]] (monocotyledons) of division [[Magnoliophyta]] (angiosperms).

Under the [[Dahlgren system]], Dioscoreales was placed in the superorder [[Lilianae]] in subclass [[Liliidae]] (monocotyledons) of class [[Magnoliopsida]] (angiosperms) and comprised the families Dioscoreaceae, [[Petermanniaceae]], [[Rhipogonaceae]], [[Smilacaceae]], [[Stemonaceae]], Taccaceae, Trichopodaceae and [[Trilliaceae]].

'''Dentistry''' is the branch of [[medicine]] that is involved in the study, [[diagnosis]], prevention, and treatment of [[diseases]], disorders and conditions of the [[mouth|oral cavity]], maxillofacial area and the adjacent and associated structures and their impact on the human body.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ada.org/495.aspx Dentistry Definitions], hosted on the American Dental Association website. Page accessed 30 May 2010. This definition was adopted the association's House of Delegates in 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Dentistry is widely considered necessary for complete overall health. Doctors who practice dentistry are known as [[dentist]]s. The dentist's [[Dental auxiliary|supporting team]] aids in providing oral health services, which includes [[dental assistant]]s, [[dental hygienist]]s, [[dental technician]]s, and [[dental therapist]]s.

==Overview==
[[Image:Tooth Section.svg|thumb|200px|[[Sagittal]] section of a tooth]]

===Dental surgery and treatments===
Dentistry usually encompasses very important practices related to the oral cavity. Oral diseases are major public health problems due to their high incidence and prevalence across the globe with the disadvantaged affected more than other socio-economic groups.&lt;ref&gt;The World Oral Health Report 2003: continuous improvement of oral health in the 21st century – the approach of the WHO Global Oral Health Programme&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of dental treatments are carried out to prevent or treat the two most common oral diseases which are [[dental caries]] (tooth decay) and [[periodontal disease]] (gum disease or pyorrhea). Common treatments involve the [[dental restoration|restoration of teeth]] as a treatment for dental caries (fillings), [[dental extraction|extraction]] or surgical removal of teeth which cannot be restored, [[scaling and root planing|scaling]] of teeth to treat periodontal problems and endodontic [[endodontic therapy|root canal]] treatment to treat abscessed teeth.

All dentists train for around 5 or 6 years at University and qualify as a 'dental surgeon'. By nature of their general training they can carry out the majority of dental treatments such as restorative (fillings, [[crown (dentistry)|crowns]], [[bridge (dentistry)|bridges]]), prosthetic ([[dentures]]), endodontic (root canal) therapy, periodontal (gum) therapy, and exodontia (extraction of teeth), as well as performing examinations, radiographs (x-rays) and diagnosis. Dentists can also prescribe certain medications such as [[antibiotic]]s, [[fluoride]]s, and [[sedative]]s but they are not able to prescribe the full range that physicians can.

Dentists need to take additional qualifications or training to carry out more complex treatments such as [[sedation]], [[oral and maxillofacial surgery]], and [[dental implant|implants]]. Whilst the majority of oral diseases are unique and self limiting, some can indicate poor general health, tumours, blood [[dyscrasia]]s and abnormalities including genetic problems.

===Prevention===
Dentists also encourage prevention of dental caries through proper [[hygiene]] ([[tooth brushing]] and [[flossing]]), [[fluoride]], and [[tooth polishing]]. [[Dental sealant]]s are plastic materials applied to one or more teeth, for the intended purpose of preventing dental caries (cavities) or other forms of tooth decay. Recognized but less conventional preventive agents include [[xylitol]], which is [[bacteriostatic]],&lt;ref name=&quot;aapd&quot;&gt;American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry.

==Education and licensing==
[[Image:Early dental chair, Shamrock, TX IMG 6151.JPG|200px|right|thumb|Early dental chair in [[Pioneer West Museum]] in [[Shamrock, Texas|Shamrock]], [[Texas]]]]

The first dental school, [[Baltimore College of Dental Surgery]], opened in Baltimore, Maryland, USA in 1840. Philadelphia Dental College was founded in 1863 and is the second in the United States. In 1907 Temple University accepted a bid to incorporate the school.

Studies showed that dentists graduated from different countries,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Zadik Yehuda, Levin Liran |title=Clinical decision making in restorative dentistry, endodontics, and antibiotic prescription |journal=J Dent Educ |volume=72 |issue=1 |pages=81–6 |year=2008 |month=January |pmid=18172239 |doi= |url= |accessdate=2008-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; or even from different dental schools in one country,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Zadik Yehuda, Levin Liran |title=Decision making of Hebrew University and Tel Aviv University Dental Schools graduates in every day dentistry--is there a difference? |journal=J Isr Dent Assoc |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=19–23 |year=2006 |month=April |pmid=16886872 |doi= |url= |accessdate=2008-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; may have different clinical decisions for the same clinical condition. For example, dentists graduated from [[Israel]]i dental schools may recommend more often for the removal of asymptomatic impacted [[third molar]] (wisdom teeth) than dentists graduated from Latin American or Eastern European dental schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Zadik Yehuda, Levin Liran |title=Decision making of Israeli, East European, and South American dental school graduates in third molar surgery: is there a difference? |journal=J Oral Maxillofac Surg |volume=65 |issue=4 |pages=658–62 |year=2007 |month=April |pmid=17368360 |doi= 10.1016/j.joms.2006.09.002|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6WKF-4N8JDW3-J&amp;_user=10&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=734474d0fe654970b56c219106722fb6 |accessdate=2008-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United Kingdom]], the 1878 British Dentists Act and 1879 Dentists Register limited the title of &quot;dentist&quot; and &quot;dental surgeon&quot; to qualified and registered practitioners.&lt;ref name=&quot;125years&quot;&gt;Gelbier, Stanley.

The 1879 register is referred to as the &quot;Dental Register&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bdatimeline&quot; /&gt; However, others could legally describe themselves as &quot;dental experts&quot; or &quot;dental consultants&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2507&amp;dat=19550208&amp;id=Ihc1AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=9aULAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2264,3628076|title=Failure of Act|publisher=[[The Glasgow Herald]]|date=8 February 1955|accessdate=2 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice of dentistry in the United Kingdom became fully regulated with the 1921 Dentists Act, which required the registration of anyone practicing dentistry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rcsed.ac.uk/site/682/default.aspx History of Dental Surgery in Edinburgh], hosted on the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh website.

In Korea, Taiwan, Japan, Sweden, Germany, the United States, and Canada, a dentist is a healthcare professional qualified to practice dentistry after graduating with a degree of either Doctor of Dental Surgery ([[Doctor of Dental Surgery|DDS]]) or Doctor of Dental Medicine ([[Doctor of Dental Medicine|DMD]]). This is equivalent to the Bachelor of Dental Surgery/Baccalaureus Dentalis Chirurgiae ([[Bachelor of Dental Surgery|BDS, BDent, BChD, BDSc]]) that is awarded in the UK and British Commonwealth countries. In most western countries, to become a qualified dentist one must usually complete at least four years of postgraduate study{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}; within the [[European Union]] the education has to be at least five years. Dentists usually complete between five and eight years of post-secondary education before practising. Though not mandatory, many dentists choose to complete an internship or residency focusing on specific aspects of dental care after they have received their dental degree.

==History==
[[Image:Johann Liss 002a.jpg|thumb|left|''Farmer at the dentist'', [[Johann Liss]], c. 1616-17.]]

The [[Indus Valley Civilization]] has yielded evidence of dentistry being practiced as far back as 7000 BC.&lt;ref name=Coppa&gt;Coppa, A. et al. 2006. [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v440/n7085/pdf/440755a.pdf ''Early Neolithic tradition of dentistry'']. ''Nature''. Volume 440. 6 April 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; This earliest form of dentistry involved curing tooth related disorders with [[bow drill]]s operated, perhaps, by skilled bead craftsmen.&lt;ref&gt;BBC (2006). [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4882968.stm ''Stone age man used dentist drill''].&lt;/ref&gt; The reconstruction of this ancient form of dentistry showed that the methods used were reliable and effective.&lt;ref&gt;MSNBC (2008). [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/12168308/ ''Dig uncovers ancient roots of dentistry''].&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] text from 5000 BC describes a &quot;tooth worm&quot; as the cause of [[dental caries]].&lt;ref name=&quot;adahistory&quot;&gt;[http://www.ada.org/public/resources/history/timeline_ancient.asp History of Dentistry: Ancient Origins], hosted on the [http://www.ada.org American Dental Association] website. Page accessed 9 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence of this belief has also been found in ancient [[India]], [[Egypt]], [[Japan]], and [[China]]. The legend of the worm is also found in the writings of [[Homer]], and as late as the 14th century AD the surgeon [[Guy de Chauliac]] still promoted the belief that worms cause tooth decay.&lt;ref name=&quot;suddickhistorical&quot;&gt;Suddick, Richard P. and Norman O. Harris. [http://crobm.iadrjournals.org/cgi/reprint/1/2/135.pdf &quot;Historical Perspectives of Oral Biology: A Series&quot;]. Critical Reviews in Oral Biology and Medicine, 1(2), pages 135-151, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Edwin Smith Papyrus]], written in the 17th century BC but which may reflect previous manuscripts from as early as 3000 BC, includes the treatment of several dental ailments.&lt;ref&gt;Arab, M. Sameh. [http://www.arabworldbooks.com/articles8c.htm Medicine in Ancient Egypt].

[[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] scholars [[Hippocrates]] and [[Aristotle]] wrote about dentistry, including the eruption pattern of teeth, treating decayed teeth and [[gum disease]], extracting teeth with [[forceps]], and using wires to stabilize loose teeth and fractured jaws.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ada.org/public/resources/history/timeline_ancient.asp History of Dentistry Ancient Origins]{{Dead link|date=April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some say the first use of dental appliances or [[bridge (dentistry)|bridges]] comes from the [[Etruscans]] from as early as 700 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rcpsg.ac.uk/hdrg/2006May8.htm |title=History of Dentistry Research Page, Newsletter |publisher=Rcpsg.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further research suggested that 3000 B.C. In ancient Egypt, Hesi-Re is the first named “dentist” (greatest of the teeth). The Egyptians bind replacement teeth together with gold wire. [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] medical writer [[Cornelius Celsus]] wrote extensively of oral diseases as well as dental treatments such as narcotic-containing emollients and astringents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://science.jrank.org/pages/1995/Dentistry-Skill-superstition.html |title=Dentistry - Skill And Superstition |publisher=Science.jrank.org |date= |accessdate=2010-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dentaltreatment.org.uk/history.html |title=Dental Treatment in the Ancient Times |publisher=Dentaltreatment.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, dental extractions have been used to treat a variety of illnesses. During the [[Middle Ages]] and throughout the 19th century, dentistry was not a profession in itself, and often dental procedures were performed by barbers or general [[physician]]s. [[Barber]]s usually limited their practice to extracting teeth which alleviated [[pain]] and associated chronic tooth [[infection]]. Instruments used for dental extractions date back several centuries. In the 14th century, [[Guy de Chauliac]] invented the dental pelican&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dmd.co.il/antiques |title=Antique Dental Instruments |publisher=Dmd.co.il |date= |accessdate=2010-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; (resembling a [[pelican]]'s beak) which was used up until the late 18th century. The pelican was replaced by the [[dental key]]&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt; which, in turn, was replaced by modern forceps in the 20th century.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}
[[Image:Dental office.jpg|thumb|right|A modern Dentist's chair]]
The first book focused solely on dentistry was the &quot;Artzney Buchlein&quot; in 1530,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ada.org/public/resources/history/timeline_midlage.asp History of Dentistry Middle Ages]{{Dead link|date=April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the first dental textbook written in English was called &quot;Operator for the Teeth&quot; by Charles Allen in 1685.&lt;ref name=&quot;bdatimeline&quot;&gt;[http://www.bda.org/museum/the-story-of-dentistry/timeline.aspx The story of dentistry: Dental History Timeline], hosted on the British Dental Association website. Page accessed 2 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; It was between 1650 and 1800 that the science of modern dentistry developed. It is said that the 17th century French physician [[Pierre Fauchard]] started dentistry science as we know it today, and he has been named ''&quot;the father of modern dentistry&quot;''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fauchard.org/publications/history/history.htm History of Dentistry Articles]{{Dead link|date=April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among many of his developments were the extensive use of [[Prosthodontics|dental prosthesis]], the introduction of [[dental fillings]] as a treatment for [[dental caries]] and the statement that sugar derivative acids such as [[tartaric acid]] are responsible for dental decay.

There has been a problem of [[quackery]] in the history of dentistry, and accusations of quackery among some dental practitioners persist today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ring|first=Malvin E|year=1998|title=Quackery in Dentistry -- Past and Present|journal=Journal of the California Dental Association|url=http://www.cda.org/library/cda_member/pubs/journal/jour1198/quackery.html|accessdate=21 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Priority patients==
UK NHS priority patients include patients with congenital abnormalities (such as [[cleft palates]] and [[hypodontia]]), patients who have suffered orofacial trauma and those being treated for [[cancer]] in the head and neck region. These are treated in a multidisciplinary team approach with other hospital based dental specialities [[orthodontics]] and [[maxillofacial surgery]]. Other priority patients include those with infections (either third molars or necrotic teeth) or avulsed permanent teeth, as well as patients with a history of smoking or smokeless tobacco with ulcers in the oral cavity also.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{about||the notion of diameter in graph theory|Distance (graph theory)|the computer network protocol|Diameter (protocol)}}

[[Image:CIRCLE 1.svg|thumb|right|Diameter]]In [[geometry]], a '''diameter''' of a [[circle]] is any straight [[line segment]] that passes through the center of the circle and whose endpoints are on the circle. The diameters are the longest [[chord (geometry)|chords]] of the circle. The word &quot;diameter&quot; derives from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''διάμετρος'' (''diametros''), &quot;diagonal of a circle&quot;, from ''δια-'' (''dia-''), &quot;across, through&quot; + ''μέτρον'' (''metron''), &quot;a measure&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=diameter Online Etymology Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;).

In more modern usage, the length of a diameter is also called the '''diameter'''. In this sense one speaks of ''the'' diameter rather than ''a'' diameter, because all diameters of a [[circle]] have the same length, this being twice the [[radius]].

For a [[convex set|convex shape]] in the plane, the diameter is defined to be the largest distance that can be formed between two opposite parallel lines tangent to its boundary, and the ''width'' is defined to be the smallest such distance. For a [[curve of constant width]] such as the [[Reuleaux triangle]], the width and diameter are the same because all such pairs of parallel tangent lines have the same distance.  See also [[Tangent lines to circles]].

==Generalizations==
The three definitions given above are special cases of a more general definition. The '''diameter''' of a [[subset]] of a [[metric space]] is the [[supremum|least upper bound]] of the distances between pairs of points in the subset. So, if ''A'' is the subset, the diameter is
:[[supremum|sup]] { d(''x'', ''y'') | ''x'', ''y'' ∈ ''A'' } .
Some authors prefer to treat the [[empty set]] (&lt;math&gt;A=\emptyset &lt;/math&gt;) as a special case.&lt;ref&gt;[http://at.yorku.ca/cgi-bin/bbqa?forum=ask_a_topologist_2004;task=show_msg;msg=0860.0002 Re: diameter of an empty set]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[differential geometry]], the diameter is an important global [[Riemannian geometry|Riemannian]] [[invariant (mathematics)|invariant]]. In plane and coordinate geometry, a diameter of a [[conic section]] is any chord which passes through the conic's centre; such diameters are not necessarily of uniform length, except in the case of the circle, which has [[eccentricity (mathematics)|eccentricity]]&amp;nbsp;''e''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.

In medical [[Idiom#Parlance|parlance]] the diameter of a [[lesion]] is the longest line segment whose endpoints are within the lesion.

==Diameter symbol==
[[Image:Sign diameter.png|thumb|150px|Sign {{Unicode|⌀}} from [[Autocad]] drawing]]
{{distinguish2|the Scandinavian letter &quot;[[Ø]]&quot; or the [[Empty set]] symbol &quot;''{{Unicode|∅}}''&quot;}}

The [[symbol]] or [[variable (mathematics)|variable]] for diameter, {{Unicode|⌀}}, is [[Homoglyph|similar in size and design]] to [[ø]], the Latin small letter o with stroke.  [[Unicode]] provides character number 8960 ([[hexadecimal]] 2300) for the symbol, which can be encoded in [[HTML]] webpages as &lt;tt&gt;&amp;amp;#8960;&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;&amp;amp;#x2300;&lt;/tt&gt;. The character can be obtained in [[Microsoft Windows]] by holding the &lt;tt&gt;[Alt]&lt;/tt&gt; key down while entering {{nowrap|&lt;tt&gt;8 9 6 0&lt;/tt&gt;}} on the [[numeric keypad]]. On an [[Apple, Inc.|Apple]] [[Macintosh]], the diameter symbol can be entered via the character palette (this is opened by pressing [[option key|{{Unicode|⌥}}]][[command key|{{Unicode|⌘}}]]T in most applications), where it can be found in the Technical Symbols category.

The character often will not display correctly, however, since most [[Typeface|font]]s do not include it. In most situations the letter ø is acceptable, which is unicode 0248 (hexadecimal 00F8). It can be obtained in UNIX-like operating systems using a [[Compose key]] by pressing, in sequence, &lt;tt&gt;Compose / o&lt;/tt&gt; and on a Macintosh by pressing {{Unicode|⌥O}} (in both cases, that is the letter [[o]], not the number [[0 (number)|0]]).

In [[LaTeX]] the symbol is achieved with the command \diameter which is part of the wasysym package.

The diameter symbol {{Unicode|&amp;#x2300;}} is distinct from the [[empty set]] symbol {{Unicode|∅}}, from an uppercase [[Phi (letter)|phi]] Φ, and the Nordic vowel Ø.

The diameter also refers to the approximate size of the corner of a frame of any given object to the nearest flat surface it represents.

{{Evidence law}}The '''Direct Examination''' or '''Examination-in-Chief''' is one stage in the process of adducing evidence from witnesses in a [[court of law]]. Direct examination is the questioning of a witness by the party who called him or her, in a [[trial (law)|trial]].  Direct examination is usually performed to elicit [[evidence (law)|evidence]] in support of facts which will satisfy a required element of a party's claim or defense.

In direct examination, one is generally prohibited from asking [[leading question]]s. This prevents a lawyer from feeding answers to a favorable witness. An exception to this rule occurs if one side has called a witness, but it is either understood, or soon becomes plain, that the witness is hostile to the questioner's side of the controversy. The lawyer may then ask the court to declare the person he or she has called to the stand a [[hostile witness]]. If the court does so, the lawyer may thereafter ply the witness with leading questions during direct examination.
