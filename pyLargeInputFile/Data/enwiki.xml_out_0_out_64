duced the ''[[Capitulary for the Jews]]'', a draconian prohibition on Jews engaging in money-lending.

In addition to this macro-oriented reform of the economy of his empire, Charlemagne also performed a significant number of microeconomic reforms, such as direct control of prices and levies on certain goods and commodities.

Charlemagne applied the system to much of the European continent, and Offa's standard was voluntarily adopted by much of [[England]]. After Charlemagne's death, continental coinage degraded, and most of Europe resorted to using the continued high-quality English coin until about 1100.

===Education reforms===
A part of Charlemagne's success as warrior and administrator can be traced to his admiration for learning. His reign and the era it ushered in are often referred to as the [[Carolingian Renaissance]] because of the flowering of scholarship, literature, art, and [[architecture]] which characterize it. Charlemagne, brought into contact with the culture and learning of other countries (especially Visigothic Spain, Anglo-Saxon England, and Lombard Italy) due to his vast conquests, greatly increased the provision of monastic schools and scriptoria (centres for book-copying) in Francia. Most of the presently surviving works of classical Latin were copied and preserved by Carolingian scholars. Indeed, the earliest manuscripts available for many ancient texts are Carolingian. It is almost certain that a text which survived to the Carolingian age survives still. The pan-European nature of Charlemagne's influence is indicated by the origins of many of the men who worked for him: [[Alcuin]], an [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] from [[York]]; [[Theodulf]], a [[Visigoths|Visigoth]], probably from [[Septimania]]; [[Paul the Deacon]], Lombard; [[Peter of Pisa]] and [[Saint Paulinus II|Paulinus of Aquileia]], [[Italians]]; and [[Angilbert]], [[Angilram]], [[Einhard]], and [[Waldo of Reichenau]], Franks.

Charlemagne took a serious interest in scholarship, promoting the [[liberal arts]] at the court, ordering that his children and grandchildren be well-educated, and even studying himself (in a time when even leaders who promoted education did not take time to learn themselves) under the tutelage of Paul the Deacon, from whom he learned grammar; Alcuin, with whom he studied rhetoric, dialectic (logic), and astronomy (he was particularly interested in the movements of the stars); and Einhard, who assisted him in his studies of arithmetic. His great scholarly failure, as Einhard relates, was his inability to write: when in his old age he began attempts to learn—practicing the formation of letters in his bed during his free time on books and wax tablets he hid under his pillow—&quot;his effort came too late in life and achieved little success&quot;, and his ability to read – which Einhard is silent about, and which no contemporary source supports—has also been called into question.&lt;ref&gt;Dutton, Paul Edward, ''Charlemagne's Mustache''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 800, Charlemagne enlarged the hostel at the [[Muristan]] in [[Jerusalem]] and added a library to it. He certainly had not been personally in Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;Karl der Grosse und das Erbe der Kulturen, Band 1999, Franz-Reiner Erkens, Akademie Verlag, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Saint-Denis zwischen Adel und König, Rolf Große, Thorbecke, Stuttgart 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Church reforms===
{{See also|Charlemagne and church music}}

===Writing reforms===
[[File:Codexaureus 04.jpg|left|thumb|Page from the [[Lorsch Gospels]] of Charlemagne's reign]]

During Charles' reign, the [[uncial|Roman half uncial]] script and its cursive version, which had given rise to various continental [[Minuscule cursive|minuscule]] scripts, were combined with features from the [[insular script]]s that were being used in [[Ireland|Irish]] and [[England|English]] monasteries. [[Carolingian minuscule]] was created partly under the patronage of Charlemagne. Alcuin of York, who ran the palace school and [[scriptorium]] at Aachen, was probably a chief influence in this. The revolutionary character of the Carolingian reform, however, can be over-emphasised; efforts at taming the crabbed Merovingian and Germanic hands had been underway before Alcuin arrived at Aachen. The new minuscule was disseminated first from Aachen and later from the influential scriptorium at [[Tours]], where Alcuin retired as an abbot.

===Political reforms===
Charlemagne engaged in many reforms of Frankish governance, but he continued also in many traditional practices, such as the division of the kingdom among sons.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

====Organization====
{{Main|Government of the Carolingian Empire}}
The Carolingian king exercised the ''[[bannum]]'', the right to rule and command. He had supreme jurisdiction in judicial matters, made legislation, led the army, and protected both the Church and the poor. His administration was an attempt to organise the kingdom, church, and nobility around him. However, the effort was heavily dependent upon the efficiency, loyalty, and support of his subjects.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

====Imperial coronation====
[[File:AachenerDomKarlsthron 1661a.jpg|thumb|right|Throne of Charlemagne and the subsequent German Kings in Aachen Cathedral]]

Historians have debated for centuries whether Charlemagne was aware of the Pope's intent to crown him Emperor prior to the coronation (Charlemagne declared that he would not have entered Saint Peter's had he known), but that debate has often obscured the more significant question of ''why'' the Pope granted the title and why Charlemagne chose to accept it once he did.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

[[Roger Collins]] points out&lt;ref&gt;Collins, ''Charlemagne'', p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;That the motivation behind the acceptance of the imperial title was a romantic and antiquarian interest in reviving the Roman empire is highly unlikely.&quot; For one thing, such romance would not have appealed either to Franks or Roman Catholics at the turn of the ninth century, both of whom viewed the [[Classical antiquity|Classical]] heritage of the Roman Empire with distrust. The Franks took pride in having &quot;fought against and thrown from their shoulders the heavy yoke of the Romans&quot; and &quot;from the knowledge gained in baptism, clothed in gold and precious stones the bodies of the holy martyrs whom the Romans had killed by fire, by the sword and by wild animals&quot;, as Pippin III described it in a law of 763 or 764 (Collins 151). Furthermore, the new title—carrying with it the risk that the new emperor would &quot;make drastic changes to the traditional styles and procedures of government&quot; or &quot;concentrate his attentions on Italy or on Mediterranean concerns more generally&quot;—risked alienating the Frankish leadership.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, ''Charlemagne'', p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt;

For both the Pope and Charlemagne, the Roman Empire remained a significant power in European politics at this time, and continued to hold a substantial portion of Italy, with borders not very far south of the city of Rome itself—this is the empire historiography has labelled the Byzantine Empire, for its capital was Constantinople (ancient Byzantium) and its people and rulers were [[Byzantine Empire|Greek]]; it was a thoroughly Hellenic state. Indeed, Charlemagne was usurping the prerogatives of the Roman Emperor in Constantinople simply by sitting in judgement over the Pope in the first place:

{{quote|By whom, however, could he [the Pope] be tried? Who, in other words, was qualified to pass judgement on the Vicar of Christ? In normal circumstances the only conceivable answer to that question would have been the Emperor at Constantinople; but the imperial throne was at this moment occupied by Irene. That the Empress was notorious for having blinded and murdered her own son was, in the minds of both Leo and Charles, almost immaterial: it was enough that she was a woman. The female sex was known to be incapable of governing, and by the old Salic tradition was debarred from doing so. As far as Western Europe was concerned, the Throne of the Emperors was vacant: Irene's claim to it was merely an additional proof, if any were needed, of the degradation into which the so-called Roman Empire had fallen.|[[John Julius Norwich]]|Byzantium: The Early Centuries, pg. 378}}
[[File:Karl 1 mit papst gelasius gregor1 sacramentar v karl d kahlen.jpg|thumb|left|Coronation of an idealised king, depicted in the Sacramentary of [[Charles the Bald]] (about 870)]]

For the Pope, then, there was &quot;no living Emperor at the that time&quot; (Norwich 379), though [[Henri Pirenne]] (''Mohammed and Charlemagne'', pg. 234n) disputes this saying that the coronation &quot;was not in any sense explained by the fact that at this moment a woman was reigning in Constantinople.&quot;  Nonetheless, the Pope took the extraordinary step of creating one. The papacy had since 727 been in conflict with Irene's predecessors in Constantinople over a number of issues, chiefly the continued Byzantine adherence to the doctrine of iconoclasm, the destruction of Christian images; while from 750, the secular power of the Byzantine Empire in central Italy had been nullified. By bestowing the Imperial crown upon Charlemagne, the Pope arrogated to himself &quot;the right to appoint ... the Emperor of the Romans, ... establishing the imperial crown as his own personal gift but simultaneously granting himself implicit superiority over the Emperor whom he had created.&quot; And &quot;because the Byzantines had proved so unsatisfactory from every point of view—political, military and doctrinal—he would select a westerner: the one man who by his wisdom and statesmanship and the vastness of his dominions ... stood out head and shoulders above his contemporaries.&quot;

With Charlemagne's coronation, therefore, &quot;the Roman Empire remained, so far as either of them [Charlemagne and Leo] were concerned, one and indivisible, with Charles as its Emperor&quot;, though there can have been &quot;little doubt that the coronation, with all that it implied, would be furiously contested in Constantinople.&quot; (Norwich, ''Byzantium: The Apogee'', pg. 3)  How realistic either Charlemagne or the Pope felt it to be that the people of Constantinople would ever accept the King of the Franks as their Emperor, we cannot know; Alcuin speaks hopefully in his letters of an ''Imperium Christianum'' (&quot;Christian Empire&quot;), wherein, &quot;just as the inhabitants of the [Roman Empire] had been united by a common Roman citizenship&quot;, presumably this new empire would be united by a common Christian faith (Collins 151), certainly this is the view of Pirenne when he says &quot;Charles was the Emperor of the ''ecclesia'' as the Pope conceived it, of the Roman Church, regarded as the universal Church&quot; (Pirenne 233).
[[File:Charlemagne1.gif|thumb|right|19th century depiction of the imperial [[coronation]] of Charlemagne]]
What is known, from the Byzantine chronicler [[Theophanes the Confessor|Theophanes]] (Collins 153), is that Charlemagne's reaction to his coronation was to take the initial steps toward securing the Constantinopolitan throne by sending envoys of marriage to Irene, and that Irene reacted somewhat favorably to them.  Only when the people of Constantinople reacted to Irene's failure to immediately rebuff the proposal by deposing her and replacing her with one of her ministers, Nicephorus I, did Charlemagne drop any ambitions toward the Byzantine throne and begin minimising his new Imperial title,{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} and instead return to describing himself primarily as ''rex Francorum et Langobardum''.

The title of emperor remained in his family for years to come, however, as brothers fought over who had the supremacy in the Frankish state. The papacy itself never forgot the title nor abandoned the right to bestow it. When the family of Charles ceased to produce worthy heirs, the pope gladly crowned whichever Italian magnate could best protect him from his local enemies. This devolution led, as could have been expected, to the dormancy of the title for almost forty years (924–962). Finally, in 962, in a radically different Europe from Charlemagne's, a new Roman Emperor was crowned in Rome by a grateful pope.  This emperor, [[Otto the Great]], brought the title into the hands of the kings of Germany for almost a millennium, for it was to become the Holy Roman Empire, a true imperial successor to Charles, if not [[Augustus]].

====Divisio regnorum====
In 806, Charlemagne first made provision for the traditional division of the empire on his death. For Charles the Younger he designated Austrasia and Neustria, Saxony, Burgundy, and [[Thuringia]]. To Pippin he gave Italy, Bavaria, and [[Swabia]]. Louis received Aquitaine, the Spanish March, and [[Provence]]. There was no mention of the imperial title however, which has led to the suggestion that, at that particular time, Charlemagne regarded the title as an honorary achievement which held no hereditary significance.

This division might have worked, but it was never to be tested. Pippin died in 810 and Charles in 811. Charlemagne then reconsidered the matter, and in 813, crowned his youngest son, Louis, co-emperor and co-King of the Franks, granting him a half-share of the empire and the rest upon Charlemagne's own death. The only part of the Empire which Louis was not promised was Italy, which Charlemagne specifically bestowed upon Pippin's illegitimate son [[Bernard of Italy|Bernard]].

==Cultural uses==
Charlemagne had an immediate afterlife. The author of the ''[[Visio Karoli Magni]]'' written around 865 uses facts gathered apparently from Einhard and his own observations on the decline of Charlemagne's family after the dissensions war (840–43) as the basis for a visionary tale of Charles' meeting with a prophetic spectre in a dream.

[[File:Charlemagne Agostino Cornacchini Vatican 2.jpg|thumb|upright|Statue of Charlemagne by [[Agostino Cornacchini]] (1725), [[St. Peter's Basilica]], Vatican, Italy.]]
Charlemagne, being a model [[knight]] as one of the [[Nine Worthies]], enjoyed an important afterlife in European culture. One of the great medieval [[literary cycle]]s, the Charlemagne cycle or the ''[[Matter of France]]'', centres on the deeds of Charlemagne—the Emperor with the Flowing Beard  of ''[[Song of Roland|Roland]]'' fame—and his historical commander of the border with [[Brittany]], [[Roland]], and the [[paladin]]s who are analogous to the knights of the [[Round Table (Camelot)|Round Table]] or [[King Arthur]]'s court. Their tales constitute the first ''[[chanson de geste|chansons de geste]]''.

Charlemagne himself was accorded sainthood inside the Holy Roman Empire after the twelfth century. His [[canonisation]] by [[Antipope Paschal III]], to gain the favour of [[Frederick Barbarossa]] in 1165, was never recognised by the [[Holy See]], which annulled all of Paschal's ordinances at the [[Third Lateran Council]] in 1179. However, his [[beatification]] has been acknowledged as ''[[Historical process of beatification and canonization#Confirmation of cult|cultus confirmed]]'' and is celebrated on January 28. In [[the Divine Comedy]] the spirit of Charlemagne appears to Dante in the Heaven of Mars, among the other &quot;warriors of the faith.&quot;

Charlemagne is sometimes credited with supporting the insertion of the ''[[filioque]]'' into the [[Nicene Creed]]. The Franks had inherited a Visigothic tradition of referring to the Holy Spirit as deriving from God the Father ''and Son'' (''Filioque''), and under Charlemagne, the Franks challenged the 381 Council of Constantinople proclamation that the Holy Spirit proceeded from the Father alone. [[Pope Leo III]] rejected this notion, and had the Nicene Creed carved into the doors of [[Old St. Peter's Basilica]] without the offending phrase; the Frankish insistence led to bad relations between Rome and Francia. Later, the [[Roman Catholic Church]] would adopt the phrase, leading to dispute between Rome and Constantinople. Some see this as one of many pre-cursors to the [[East-West Schism]] centuries later.&lt;ref&gt;Riche, Pierre, ''The Carolingians'', p.124&lt;/ref&gt;

French volunteers in the Wehrmacht and later Waffen-SS during World War II were organised in a unit called ''[[33rd Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS Charlemagne (1st French)]]''. A German Waffen-SS unit used &quot;Karl der Große&quot; for some time in 1943, but then chose the name ''[[10th SS Panzer Division Frundsberg]]'' instead.

The city of Aachen has, since 1949, awarded an international prize (called the ''[[Karlspreis]] der Stadt Aachen'') in honour of Charlemagne. It is awarded annually to &quot;personages of merit who have promoted the idea of western unity by their political, economic and literary endeavours.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Chamberlin, Russell, ''The Emperor Charlemagne'', p. ???&lt;/ref&gt; Winners of the prize include [[Richard Nikolaus Graf Coudenhove-Kalergi|Count Richard Coudenhove-Kalergi]], the founder of the pan-European movement, [[Alcide De Gasperi]], and [[Winston Churchill]].

Charlemagne is quoted by Dr Henry Jones Sr. (played by [[Sean Connery]]) in ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]''. After using his umbrella to induce a flock of seagulls to smash through the glass cockpit of a pursuing German fighter plane, Henry Jones remarks, &quot;I suddenly remembered my Charlemagne: 'Let my armies be the rocks and the trees and the birds in the sky'.&quot; Despite the quote's popularity since the movie, there is no evidence that Charlemagne actually said this.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.quidplura.com/?p=29 Quid plura? | &quot;Flying birds, excellent birds...&quot;&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Economist]]'', the weekly news and international affairs newspaper, features a one-page article every week entitled &quot;Charlemagne&quot;, focusing generally on European affairs and, more usually and specifically, on the [[European Union]] and its politics. While ''Economist'' writers are all technically anonymous, the column is known to be written by [[David Rennie (columnist)|David Rennie]], who took the position in 2007.

There is a play named &quot;Carelman Charitham&quot; in the [[India]]n art-form [[Chavittu Nadakam]] which is based on the life of Charlemagne.

==Family==
===Marriages and heirs===
Charlemagne had twenty children over the course of his life with eight of his ten known wives or concubines. Nonetheless, he only had four legitimate grandsons, the four sons of his third son, Louis. In addition, he had a grandson ([[Bernard of Italy]], the only son of his third son, [[Pippin of Italy]]), who was born illegitimate but included in the line of inheritance. So, despite twenty children, the claimants to his inheritance were few.
*His first relationship was with [[Himiltrude]]. The nature of this relationship is variously described as [[concubine|concubinage]], a legal marriage, or a [[Friedelehe]].&lt;ref&gt;Charlemagne's biographer [[Einhard]] (Vita Karoli Magni, ch. 20) calls her a &quot;concubine&quot; and [[Paulus Diaconus]] speaks of Pippin's birth &quot;before legal marriage&quot;, whereas a letter by [[Pope Stephen III]] refers to Charlemagne and his brother Carloman as being already married (to Himiltrude and [[Gerberga, wife of Carloman I|Gerberga]]), and advises them not to dismiss their wives. Historians have interpreted the information in different ways. Some, such as [[Pierre Riché]] (''The Carolingians'', p.86.), follow Einhard in describing Himiltrude as a concubine. Others, for example Dieter Hägemann (''Karl der Große. Herrscher des Abendlands'', p. 82f.), consider Himiltrude a wife in the full sense. Still others subscribe to the idea that the relationship between the two was &quot;something more than concubinage, less than marriage&quot; and describe it as a [[Friedelehe]], a form of marriage unrecognized by the Church and easily dissolvable. Russell Chamberlin (''The Emperor Charlemagne'', p. 61.), for instance, compared it with the English system of common-law marriage. This form of relationship is often seen in a conflict between Christian marriage and more flexible Germanic concepts.&lt;/ref&gt; (Charlemagne put her aside when he married Desiderata.) The union with Himiltrude produced two children:
**Amaudru, a daughter&lt;ref name=&quot;Treffer&quot;&gt;Gerd Treffer, ''Die französischen Königinnen. Von Bertrada bis Marie Antoinette (8.-18. Jahrhundert)'' [http://www.mittelalter-genealogie.de/karolinger_familie_karls/himiltrud_frankenkoenigin_769.html p. 30].&lt;/ref&gt;
**[[Pippin the Hunchback]] (ca. 769–811)
*After her, his first wife was [[Desiderata, wife of Charlemagne|Desiderata]], daughter of [[Desiderius]], king of the [[Lombards]]; married in 770, annulled in 771.
*His second wife was [[Hildegard, wife of Charlemagne|Hildegard]] (757 or 758–783), married 771, died 783. By her he had nine children:
**[[Charles the Younger, son of Charlemagne|Charles the Younger]] (ca. 772–4 December 811), Duke of Maine, and crowned [[King of the Franks]] on 25 December 800
**[[Pippin of Italy|Carloman, renamed Pippin]] (April 777–8 July 810), [[King of Italy]]
**Adalhaid (774), who was born whilst her parents were on campaign in Italy. She was sent back to Francia, but died before reaching Lyons
**[[Rotrude]] (or Hruodrud) (775–6 June 810)
**[[Louis the Pious|Louis]] (778–20 June 840), twin of Lothair, [[King of Aquitaine]] since 781, crowned [[List of Frankish kings|King of the Franks/co-emperor]] in 813, senior Emperor from 814
**Lothair (778–6 February 779/780), twin of Louis, he died in infancy&lt;ref&gt;&quot;By [Hildigard] Charlemagne had four sons and four daughters, according to Paul the Deacon: one son, the twin of Lewis, called Lothar, died as a baby and is not mentioned by Einhard; two daughters, Hildigard and Adelhaid, died as babies, so that Einhard appears to err in one of his names, unless there were really five daughters.&quot; Thorpe, Lewis, ''Two Lives of Charlemagne'', p.185&lt;/ref&gt;
**[[Bertha, daughter of Charlemagne|Bertha]] (779–826)
**[[Gisela, daughter of Charlemagne|Gisela]] (781–808)
**Hildegarde (782–783)
*His third wife was [[Fastrada]], married 784, died 794. By her he had:
**[[Theodrada]] (b.784), [[abbess]] of [[Argenteuil]]
**Hiltrude (b.787)
*His fourth wife was [[Luitgard]], married 794, died childless.

===Concubinages and illegitimate children===
*His first known concubine was [[Gersuinda]]. By her he had:
**Adaltrude (b.774)
*His second known concubine was [[Madelgard]]. By her he had:
**[[Ruodhaid, daughter of Charlemagne|Ruodhaid]] (775–810), [[abbess]] of [[Abbey of Faremoutiers|Faremoutiers]]
*His third known concubine was [[Amaltrud of Vienne]]. By her he had:
**Alpaida (b.794)
*His fourth known concubine was [[Regina (concubine)|Regina]]. By her he had:
**[[Drogo of Metz|Drogo]] (801–855), [[Bishop of Metz]] from 823 and abbot of [[Luxeuil Abbey]]
**[[Hugh, son of Charlemagne|Hugh]] (802–844), [[archchancellor]] of the Empire
*His fifth known concubine was [[Ethelind]]. By her he had:
**[[Richbod, son of Charlemagne|Richbod]] (805–844), [[Abbott of Saint-Riquier]]
**[[Theodoric, son to Charlemagne|Theodoric]] (b. 807)

{{Html series}}
[[HTML]] (&lt;u&gt;H&lt;/u&gt;yper&lt;u&gt;t&lt;/u&gt;ext &lt;u&gt;M&lt;/u&gt;arkup &lt;u&gt;L&lt;/u&gt;anguage) has been in use since 1991, but HTML 4.0 (December 1997) was the first standardized version where international [[character (computing)|character]]s were given reasonably complete treatment. When an HTML document includes special characters outside the range of seven-bit [[ASCII]] two goals are worth considering: the information's [[integrity]], and universal [[Web browser|browser]] display.

==Specifying the document's character encoding==
There are several ways to specify which character encoding is used in the document. First, the [[web server]] can include the character encoding or &quot;&lt;code&gt;charset&lt;/code&gt;&quot; in the [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]] (HTTP) &lt;code&gt;Content-Type&lt;/code&gt; header, which would typically look like this:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-14.17 |chapter=Content-Type |title=Hypertext Transfer Protocol – HTTP/1.1 |first1=R. |last1=Fielding |authorlink1=Roy Fielding |first2=J. |last2=Gettys |authorlink2=Jim Gettys |first3=J. |last3=Mogul |first4=H. |last4=Frystyk |authorlink4=Henrik Frystyk Nielsen |first5=L. |last5=Masinter |first6=P. |last6=Leach |first7=T. |last7=Berners-Lee |authorlink7=Tim Berners-Lee |publisher=[[IETF]] |date=June 1999 |accessdate=8 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 Content-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1

For HTML it is possible to include this information inside the &lt;code&gt;head&lt;/code&gt; element near the top of the document:&lt;ref name=html5charset/&gt;
&lt;source lang=html4strict&gt;
&lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;Content-Type&quot; content=&quot;text/html; charset=utf-8&quot;&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;	

[[HTML5]] also allows the following syntax to mean exactly the same:&lt;ref name=html5charset&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.whatwg.org/html/#charset |chapter=Specifying the document's character encoding |title=HTML5 |first=I. |last=Hickson |authorlink=Ian Hickson |publisher=[[WHATWG]] |date=5 March 2010 |accessdate=8 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;source lang=html4strict&gt;
&lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

[[XHTML]] documents have a third option: to express the character encoding via [[XML]] declaration, as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/#sec-prolog-dtd |chapter=Prolog and Document Type Declaration |title=XML |first1=T. |last1=Bray |authorlink1=Tim Bray |first2=J. |last2=Paoli |first3=C. |last3=Sperberg-McQueen |authorlink3=Michael Sperberg-McQueen |first4=E. |last4=Maler |first5=F. |last5=Yergeau |publisher=[[W3C]] |date=26 November 2008 |accessdate=8 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;source lang=xml&gt;
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;ISO-8859-1&quot;?&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

A known misconception about &lt;tt&gt;&amp;lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;Content-Type&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/tt&gt; is that this attribute of [[meta element]] is intended to be interpreted directly by a browser, like an ordinary HTML tag. According to WWW Consortium, it helps the HTTP server&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/global.html#edef-META The global structure of an HTML document: The META element]&lt;/ref&gt; to generate corresponding [[header (computing)|headers]] when it serves the document. The [[HTTP/1.1]] header specification for a HTML document must label an appropriate encoding in the Content-Type header,&lt;ref&gt;RFC 2616 [http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-3.7.1 3.7.1 Canonicalization and Text Defaults]&lt;/ref&gt; missing &lt;tt&gt;charset=&lt;/tt&gt; parameter results in acceptance of [[ISO-8859-1]] (so HTTP/1.1 formally does not offer such option as an unspecified character encoding), and this specification supersedes all HTML (or XHTML) meta element ones. This can pose a problem if the server generates an incorrect header and one does not have the access or the knowledge to change them.

As each of these methods explain to the receiver how the file being sent should be interpreted, it would be inappropriate for these declarations not to match the actual character encoding used. Because a server usually can't know how a document is encoded—especially if documents are created on different platforms or in different regions—many servers{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} simply do not include a reference to the &quot;&lt;code&gt;charset&lt;/code&gt;&quot; in the &lt;code&gt;Content-Type&lt;/code&gt; header, thus avoiding making false promises. However, if the document does not specify the encoding either, this may result in the equally bad situation where the [[user agent]] displays [[mojibake]] because it cannot find out which character encoding was used. Due to widespread and persistent ignorance of HTTP &lt;tt&gt;charset=&lt;/tt&gt; over the Internet (at its server side), WWW Consortium disappointed in HTTP/1.1’s strict approach&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/charset.html#h-5.2.2 HTML 4, HTML Document Representation: Specifying the character encoding]&lt;/ref&gt; and encourage browser developers to use some fixes in violation of RFC 2616.

If a user agent reads a document with no character encoding information, it can fall back to using some other information. For example, it can rely on the user's settings, either browser-wide or specific for a given document, or it can pick a default encoding based on the user's language. For Western European languages, it is typical and fairly safe to assume [[Windows-1252]], which is similar to ISO-8859-1 but has printable characters in place of some control codes. The consequence of choosing incorrectly is that characters outside the printable ASCII range (32 to 126) usually appear incorrectly. This presents few problems for [[English language|English]]-speaking users, but other languages regularly—in some cases, always—require characters outside that range. In [[CJK]] environments where there are several different multi-byte encodings in use, auto-detection is also often employed. Finally, browsers usually permit the user to override ''incorrect'' charset label manually as well. 

It is increasingly common for multilingual websites and websites in non-Western languages to use [[UTF-8]], which allows use of the same encoding for all languages. [[UTF-16]] or [[UTF-32]], which can be used for all languages as well, are less widely used because they can be harder to handle in programming languages that assume a [[byte-oriented]] ASCII superset encoding, and they are less efficient for text with a high frequency of ASCII characters, which is usually the case for HTML documents. 

Successful viewing of a page is not necessarily an indication that its encoding is specified correctly. If the page's creator and reader are both assuming some platform-specific character encoding, and the server does not send any identifying information, then the reader will nonetheless see the page as the creator intended, but other readers on different platforms or with different native languages will not see the page as intended.

==Character references==
{{Main|Character entity reference|Numeric character reference}}

In addition to native character encodings, characters can also be encoded as ''character references'', which can be ''numeric character references'' ([[decimal]] or [[hexadecimal]]) or ''character entity references''. Character entity references are also sometimes referred to as ''named entities'', or ''HTML entities'' for HTML. HTML's usage of character references derives from [[SGML]]. 

===HTML character references===
Numeric character references can be in decimal format, &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;#''DD'';&lt;/code&gt;, where &lt;code&gt;''DD''&lt;/code&gt; is a variable number of decimal digits. Similarly there is a hexadecimal format, &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;#x''HHHH'';&lt;/code&gt;, where &lt;code&gt;''HHHH''&lt;/code&gt; is a variable number of hexadecimal digits. Hexadecimal character references are case-insensitive in HTML. For example, the character 'λ' can be represented as &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;#955;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;#x03BB;&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;#X03bb;&lt;/code&gt;. Numeric references ''always'' refer to [[Unicode]] code points, regardless of the page's encoding. Using numeric references that refer to permanently undefined characters and control characters is forbidden, with the exception of the linefeed, tab, and carriage return characters. That is, characters in the hexadecimal ranges 00–08, 0B–0C, 0E–1F, 7F, and 80–9F cannot be used in an HTML document, ''not even by reference'', so &quot;&amp;amp;#153;&quot;, for example, is not allowed. However, for backward compatibility with early HTML authors and browsers that ignored this restriction, raw characters and numeric character references in the 80–9F range are interpreted by some browsers as representing the characters mapped to bytes 80–9F in the Windows-1252 encoding. 

Character entity references have the format &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;''name'';&lt;/code&gt; where &quot;name&quot; is a case-sensitive alphanumeric string. For example, 'λ' can also be encoded as &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;lambda;&lt;/code&gt; in an HTML document. The character entity references &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;lt;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt; are predefined in HTML and SGML, because &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&quot;&lt;/code&gt;  and &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt; are already used to delimit markup. This notably does not include XML's &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;apos;&lt;/code&gt; (') entity. For a list of all named HTML character entity references, see '''[[List of XML and HTML character entity references]]''' (approximately 250 entries).

Unnecessary use of HTML character references may significantly reduce HTML readability. If the character encoding for a web page is chosen appropriately then HTML character references are usually only required for a markup delimiting characters mentioned above, and for a few special characters (or not at all if a native [[Unicode]] encoding like [[UTF-8]] is used). However, to prevent HTML injection attacks like [[Cross Site Scripting]] you should be very careful to use HTML entity escaping properly. If HTML attributes are not fully quoted, then you must entity encode whitespace like space, tab, and others. Other HTML contexts like javascript, css styles, and URLs require different escaping formats. See http://www.owasp.org/index.php/XSS_(Cross_Site_Scripting)_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet for details on each of the different contexts.

===XML character references===
Unlike traditional HTML with its large range of character entity references, in [[XML]] there are only five predefined character entity references. These are used to escape characters that are markup sensitive in certain contexts:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/#sec-references |chapter=Character and Entity References |title=XML |first1=T. |last1=Bray |authorlink1=Tim Bray |first2=J. |last2=Paoli |first3=C. |last3=Sperberg-McQueen |authorlink3=Michael Sperberg-McQueen |first4=E. |last4=Maler |first5=F. |last5=Yergeau |publisher=[[W3C]] |date=26 November 2008 |accessdate=8 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*&lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt;  → &amp; ([[ampersand]], U+0026)
*&lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;lt;&lt;/code&gt;   → &lt; (less-than sign, U+003C)
*&lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;   → &gt; (greater-than sign, U+003E)
*&lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; → &quot; (quotation mark, U+0022)
*&lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;apos;&lt;/code&gt; → ' (apostrophe, U+0027)

All other character entity references have to be defined before they can be used. For example, use of &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;eacute;&lt;/code&gt; (which gives é, Latin lower-case E with acute accent, U+00E9 in Unicode) in an XML document will generate an error unless the entity has already been defined. XML also requires that the &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; in hexadecimal numeric references be in lowercase: for example &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;#xA1b&lt;/code&gt; rather than &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;#XA1b&lt;/code&gt;. [[XHTML]], which is an XML application, supports the HTML entity set, along with XML's predefined entities.

However, use of &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;apos;&lt;/code&gt; in XHTML should generally be avoided for compatibility reasons. &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;#39;&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;#x0027;&lt;/code&gt; may be used instead.

&lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt; has the special problem that it starts with the character to be escaped. A simple Internet search finds thousands of sequences &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp; ...&lt;/code&gt; in HTML pages for which the algorithm to replace an ampersand by the corresponding character entity reference was applied too often.

'''Carbon nanotubes''' ('''CNTs''') are [[allotropes of carbon]] with a cylindrical nanostructure. Nanotubes have been constructed with length-to-diameter ratio of up to 132,000,000:1,&lt;ref name=&quot;Longest&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|first=X.|last=Wang|title=Fabrication of Ultralong and Electrically Uniform Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes on Clean Substrates|volume=9 |pages=3137–3141|year=2009|doi=10.1021/nl901260b|journal=Nano Letters|last2=Li|first2=Q.|last3=Xie|first3=J.|last4=Jin|first4=Z.|last5=Wang|first5=J.|last6=Li|first6=Y.|last7=Jiang|first7=K.|last8=Fan|first8=S.|issue=9|pmid=19650638
|bibcode = 2009NanoL...9.3137W }}&lt;/ref&gt; significantly larger than any other material. These cylindrical [[carbon]] [[molecule]]s have novel [[chemical property|properties]], making them potentially useful in many applications in [[nanotechnology]], [[electronics]], [[optics]], and other fields of [[materials science]], as well as potential uses in [[architecture|architectural]] fields.  They may also have applications in the construction of [[body armor]]. They exhibit extraordinary strength and unique [[electricity|electrical]] properties, and are efficient [[Conduction (heat)|thermal conductors]].

Nanotubes are members of the [[fullerene]] structural family, which also includes the spherical [[Fullerene#Buckyballs|buckyballs]]. The ends of a nanotube may be capped with a hemisphere of the buckyball structure. Their name is derived from their size, since the diameter of a nanotube is on the order of a few nanometers (approximately 1/50,000th of the width of a human hair), while they can be up to 18 centimeters in length (as of 2010).&lt;ref name=&quot;Longest&quot;/&gt; Nanotubes are categorized as [[#Single-walled|single-walled nanotubes]] (SWNTs) and [[#Multi-walled|multi-walled nanotubes]] (MWNTs).

Applied [[quantum chemistry]], specifically, [[orbital hybridization]] best describes chemical bonding in nanotubes. The [[chemical bonding]] of nanotubes is composed entirely of [[orbital hybridisation#sp2 hybrids|''sp''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; bonds]], similar to those of [[graphite]]. These bonds, which are stronger than the [[orbital hybridisation#sp3 hybrids|''sp''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; bonds]] found in [[alkane]]s, provide nanotubules with their unique strength. Moreover, nanotubes naturally align themselves into &quot;ropes&quot; held together by [[van der Waals force]]s.

'''T''' denotes the tube axis, and '''a'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and '''a'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are the unit vectors of graphene in real space.]]
[[File:Chiraltube.gif|thumb|An [[scanning tunneling microscope|STM]] image of single-walled carbon nanotube]]
[[Image:CntHAADF.jpg|thumb|Transmission electron microscopy image showing a single-walled carbon nanotube]]

Most single-walled nanotubes (SWNT) have a diameter of close to 1&amp;nbsp;nanometer, with a tube length that can be many millions of times longer. The structure of a SWNT can be conceptualized by wrapping a one-atom-thick layer of graphite called graphene into a seamless cylinder. The way the graphene sheet is wrapped is represented by a pair of indices (''n'',''m'') called the chiral vector. The integers ''n'' and ''m'' denote the number of unit [[Vector (geometric)|vectors]] along two directions in the honeycomb [[crystal lattice]] of graphene. If ''m'' = 0, the nanotubes are called zigzag. If ''n'' = ''m'', the nanotubes are called armchair. Otherwise, they are called chiral.  The diameter of a nanotube can be calculated from its (n,m) indices as follows

: &lt;math&gt; d = \frac{a}{\pi} \sqrt{(n^2 + nm + m^2)}.&lt;/math&gt;

where ''a'' = 0.246&amp;nbsp;nm.

Single-walled nanotubes are an important variety of carbon nanotube because they exhibit electric properties that are not shared by the multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWNT) variants. In particular, their [[band gap]] can vary from zero to about 2 eV and their electrical conductivity can show metallic or semiconducting behavior, whereas MWNTs are zero-gap metals. Single-walled nanotubes are the most likely candidate for miniaturizing electronics beyond the micro electromechanical scale currently used in electronics. The most basic building block of these systems is the electric wire, and SWNTs can be excellent conductors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=J.W.|last=Mintmire|title=Are Fullerene Tubules Metallic?|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=68|pages=631–634|date=3 February 1992|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.68.631|pmid=10045950|last2=Dunlap|first2=BI|last3=White|first3=CT|issue=5|bibcode=1992PhRvL..68..631M}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dekker|first=Cees|title=Carbon nanotubes as molecular quantum wires|year=1999|journal=Physics Today|volume=52|pages=22–28|url=http://www.physicstoday.org/vol-56/iss-2/pdf/vol52no5p22-28.pdf |format=PDF|doi=10.1063/1.882658|issue=5|bibcode = 1999PhT....52e..22D }}&lt;/ref&gt; One useful application of SWNTs is in the development of the first intramolecular [[field effect transistors]] (FET).

This results in a single SWNT that acts as a NOT logic gate with both p and n-type FETs within the same molecule.

Single-walled nanotubes are dropping precipitously in price, from around $1500 per gram as of 2000 to retail prices of around $50 per gram of as-produced 40–60% by weight SWNTs as of March 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Carbon Solutions, Inc.|url=http://www.carbonsolution.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=CarboLex|url=http://carbolex.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multi-walled===
[[File:CNTSEM.JPG|thumb|[[Scanning electron microscope|SEM]] image of carbon nanotubes bundles.]]
[[File:Multi-walled Carbon Nanotube.png|thumb|Triple-walled armchair carbon nanotube]]
Multi-walled nanotubes (MWNT) consist of multiple rolled layers (concentric tubes) of graphite. There are two models which can be used to describe the structures of multi-walled nanotubes. In the ''[[Matryoshka doll|Russian Doll]]'' model, sheets of graphite are arranged in concentric cylinders, e.g. a (0,8) single-walled nanotube (SWNT) within a larger (0,17) single-walled nanotube. In the ''[[Scroll (parchment)|Parchment]]'' model, a single sheet of graphite is rolled in around itself, resembling a scroll of parchment or a rolled newspaper. The interlayer distance in multi-walled nanotubes is close to the distance between graphene layers in graphite, approximately 3.4 Å.

The special place of double-walled carbon nanotubes (DWNT) must be emphasized here because their morphology and properties are similar to SWNT but their resistance to chemicals is significantly improved. This is especially important when [[Surface functionalization|functionalization]] is required (this means grafting of chemical functions at the surface of the nanotubes) to add new properties to the CNT. In the case of SWNT, covalent functionalization will break some C=C [[double bond]]s, leaving &quot;holes&quot; in the structure on the nanotube and thus modifying both its mechanical and electrical properties. In the case of DWNT, only the outer wall is modified. DWNT synthesis on the gram-scale was first proposed in 2003&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=E.|last=Flahaut|year=2003|title=Gram-Scale CCVD Synthesis of Double-Walled Carbon Nanotubes|journal=Chemical Communications|volume=12|pages=1442–1443|doi=10.1039/b301514a|pmid=12841282|last2=Bacsa|first2=R|last3=Peigney|first3=A|last4=Laurent|first4=C|issue=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the CCVD technique, from the selective reduction of oxide solutions in methane and hydrogen.

===Torus===
[[Image:NanoBud.JPG|thumb|A stable [[Carbon nanobud|nanobud]] structure]]
In theory, a nanotorus is a carbon nanotube bent into a [[torus]] (doughnut shape). Nanotori are predicted to have many unique properties, such as magnetic moments 1000 times larger than previously expected for certain specific radii.&lt;ref name=&quot;nanotori&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Liu|first=Lei|title=Colossal Paramagnetic Moments in Metallic Carbon Nanotori|year=2002|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=88|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.88.217206|page=217206|last2=Guo|first2=G.

===Nanobud===
[[Carbon nanobud]]s are a newly created material combining two previously discovered allotropes of carbon: carbon nanotubes and fullerenes. In this new material, fullerene-like &quot;buds&quot; are covalently bonded to the outer sidewalls of the underlying carbon nanotube. This hybrid material has useful properties of both fullerenes and carbon nanotubes. In particular, they have been found to be exceptionally good field emitters. In composite materials, the attached fullerene molecules may function as molecular anchors preventing slipping of the nanotubes, thus improving the composite’s mechanical properties.

===Cup stacked carbon nanotubes===
Cup-stacked carbon nanotubes (CSCNTs) differ from other  quasi-1D carbon structures, which normally behave as quasi-metallic conductors of electrons. CSCNTs exhibit semiconducting behaviors due to the stacking microstructure of graphene layers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://carbon.imr.ac.cn/file/Journal/2009/1249016438117.pdf|last1=Liu|journal=Carbon|first1=Q|volume=47|last2=Ren|pages=731|first2=W|last3=Chen|first3=Z|last4=Yin|first4=L|last5=Li|first5=F|last6=Cong|first6=H|last7=Cheng|first7=H |title=Semiconducting properties of cup-stacked carbon nanotubes|year=2009|doi=10.1016/j.carbon.2008.11.005|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Extreme carbon nanotubes===
[[File:Cycloparaphenylene.PNG|thumb|Cycloparaphenylene]]

The observation of the ''longest'' carbon nanotubes (18.5&amp;nbsp;cm long) was reported in 2009. These nanotubes were grown on Si substrates using an improved [[chemical vapor deposition]] (CVD) method and represent electrically uniform arrays of single-walled carbon nanotubes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Longest&quot;/&gt;

The ''shortest'' carbon nanotube is the organic compound cycloparaphenylene which was synthesized in early 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newscenter.lbl.gov/feature-stories/2009/01/05/better-way-to-make-nanotubes/|title=A Better Way to Make Nanotubes|date=January 5, 2009|publisher=Berkeley Lab.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lbl.gov/msd/assets/docs/highlights/09-Bertozzi.pdf|title=Carbon Nanohoops: Shortest Segment of a Carbon Nanotube Synthesized|publisher=Berkeley Lab.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.nature.com/naturejobs/2009/091008/full/nj0264.html#a-centre-of-chemistry-excellence|chapter=Synthetic organic chemistry|title=A centre of chemistry excellence|publisher=Nature|date=October 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''thinnest'' carbon nanotube is armchair (2,2) CNT with a diameter of 3 Å. This nanotube was grown inside a multi-walled carbon nanotube. Assigning of carbon nanotube type was done by combination of [[high-resolution transmission electron microscopy]] (HRTEM), [[Raman spectroscopy]] and [[density functional theory]] (DFT) calculations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smallest_at_MWCNT&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|first=X.|last=Zhao|title=Smallest Carbon Nanotube is 3 Å in Diameter|volume=92|pages=125502|year=2004|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.92.125502|journal=Physical Review Letters|last2=Liu|first2=Y.|last3=Inoue|first3=S.|last4=Suzuki|first4=T.|last5=Jones|first5=R.

The ''thinnest freestanding'' single-walled carbon nanotube is about 4.3 Å in diameter.

==Properties==
===Strength===
{{See also|Mechanical properties of carbon nanotubes}}

Carbon nanotubes are the strongest and stiffest materials yet discovered in terms of [[tensile strength]] and [[elastic modulus]] respectively. This strength results from the covalent sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; bonds formed between the individual carbon atoms. In 2000, a multi-walled carbon nanotube was tested to have a tensile strength of 63&amp;nbsp;[[Pascal (unit)|gigapascals]] (GPa).&lt;ref name=&quot;Strength and Breaking&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Yu|first = Min-Feng|last2 = Lourie|first2 = Oleg|last3 = Dyer|first3 = Mark J.|last4 = Moloni|first4 = Katerina|last5 = Kelly|first5 = Thomas F.|last6 = Ruoff|first6 = Rodney S.|date=28 January 2000|title=Strength and Breaking Mechanism of Multiwalled Carbon Nanotubes Under Tensile Load|journal=Science|volume=287|issue=5453|pages=637–640|pmid=10649994|doi=10.1126/science.287.5453.637|bibcode = 2000Sci...287..637Y }}&lt;/ref&gt; (For illustration, this translates into the ability to endure tension of a weight equivalent to 6422&amp;nbsp;kg on a cable with cross-section of 1 [[millimetre|mm]]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.)

Under excessive tensile strain, the tubes will undergo [[Deformation_(engineering)#Plastic_deformation|plastic deformation]], which means the deformation is permanent. This deformation begins at strains of approximately 5% and can increase the maximum strain the tubes undergo before fracture by releasing strain energy.

CNTs are not nearly as strong under compression. Because of their hollow structure and high aspect ratio, they tend to undergo [[buckling]] when placed under compressive, torsional or bending stress.&lt;ref&gt;K. Jensen, W. Mickelson, A. Kis, and A. Zettl. Buckling and kinking force measurements on individual multiwalled carbon nanotubes. Phys. Rev. B 76, 195436 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;sup&gt;E&lt;/sup&gt;Experimental observation; &lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;Theoretical prediction

The above discussion referred to axial properties of the nanotube, whereas simple geometrical considerations suggest that carbon nanotubes should be much softer in the radial direction than along the tube axis. Indeed, [[Transmission electron microscopy|TEM]] observation of radial elasticity suggested that even the van der Waals forces can deform two adjacent nanotubes.&lt;ref&gt;R. S. Ruoff, et al., &quot;Radial deformation of carbon nanotubes by van der Waals forces&quot; [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v364/n6437/abs/364514a0.html Nature 364, 514 (1993)]&lt;/ref&gt; Nanoindentation experiments, performed by several groups on multiwalled carbon nanotubes &lt;ref&gt;I.

===Hardness===
Standard single walled carbon nanotubes can withstand a pressure up to 24GPa without deformation.  They then undergo a transformation to superhard phase nanotubes.  Maximum pressures measured using current experimental techniques are around 55GPa.  However, these new superhard phase nanotubes collapse at an even higher, albeit unknown, pressure.

The [[bulk modulus]] of superhard phase nanotubes is 462 to 546 GPa, even higher than that of diamond(420 GPa for single diamond crystal).

===Kinetic===
Multi-walled nanotubes are multiple concentric nanotubes precisely nested within one another.  These exhibit a striking telescoping property whereby an inner nanotube core may slide, almost without friction, within its outer nanotube shell, thus creating an atomically perfect linear or rotational bearing.
This is one of the first true examples of [[molecular nanotechnology]], the precise positioning of atoms to create useful machines. Already, this property has been utilized to create the world's smallest rotational [[Synthetic molecular motors|motor]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2003/07/23_motor.shtml 07.23.2003 - Physicists build world's smallest motor using nanotubes and etched silicon]&lt;/ref&gt;
Future applications such as a gigahertz mechanical oscillator are also envisaged.

===Electrical===
[[File:Carbon nanotube bands.gif|thumb|Band structures computed using tight binding approximation for (6,0) CNT (zigzag, metallic) (10,2) CNT (semiconducting) and (10,10) CNT (armchair, metallic).]]
Because of the symmetry and unique electronic structure of graphene, the structure of a nanotube strongly affects its electrical properties. For a given (''n'',''m'') nanotube, if ''n'' = ''m'', the nanotube is metallic; if ''n'' − ''m'' is a multiple of 3, then the nanotube is semiconducting with a very small band gap, otherwise the nanotube is a moderate [[semiconductor]]. Thus all armchair (''n'' = ''m'') nanotubes are metallic, and nanotubes (6,4), (9,1), etc. are semiconducting.&lt;ref name=&quot;Curvature&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|first=X.|last=Lu|first2=Z.|title=Curved Pi-Conjugation, Aromaticity, and the Related Chemistry of Small Fullerenes (&lt;C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;) and Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes|journal=[[Chemical Reviews]]|volume=105|pages=3643–3696|year=2005|doi=10.1021/cr030093d|issue=10|last2=Chen|pmid=16218563}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, this rule has exceptions, because curvature effects in small diameter carbon nanotubes can influence strongly electrical properties. Thus, a (5,0) SWCNT that should be semiconducting in fact is metallic according to the calculations.   Likewise, ''vice versa''-- zigzag and chiral SWCNTs with small diameters that should be metallic have finite gap (armchair nanotubes remain metallic).&lt;ref name=&quot;Curvature&quot;/&gt; In theory, metallic nanotubes can carry an electric current density of 4 × 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; A/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; which is more than 1,000 times greater than metals such as [[copper]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Seunghun|last=Hong|year=2007|title=Nanotube Electronics: A flexible approach to mobility|journal=Nature Nanotechnology|volume=2|pages=207–208|doi=10.1038/nnano.2007.89|pmid=18654263|last2=Myung|first2=S|issue=4|bibcode = 2007NatNa...2..207H }}&lt;/ref&gt; where for copper interconnects current densities are limited by [[electromigration]].

Multiwalled carbon nanotubes with interconnected inner shells show [[superconductivity]] with a relatively high transition temperature T&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; = 12 [[Kelvin|K]]. In contrast, the T&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; value is an order of magnitude lower for ropes of single-walled carbon nanotubes or for MWNTs with usual, non-interconnected shells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=J.

The temperature stability of carbon nanotubes is estimated to be up to 2800&amp;nbsp;°C in [[vacuum]] and about 750&amp;nbsp;°C in air.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Erik|last=Thostenson|year=2005|title=Nanocomposites in context|journal=Composites Science and Technology|volume=65|pages=491–516|doi=10.1016/j.compscitech.2004.11.003|last2=Li|first2=C|last3=Chou|first3=T|issue=3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Defects===
As with any material, the existence of a [[crystallographic defect]] affects the material properties. Defects can occur in the form of atomic [[Vacancy defect|vacancies]]. High levels of such defects can lower the tensile strength by up to 85%. Another form of carbon nanotube defect is the [[Stone Wales defect]], which creates a pentagon and heptagon pair by rearrangement of the bonds. Because of the very small structure of CNTs, the tensile strength of the tube is dependent on its weakest segment in a similar manner to a chain, where the strength of the weakest link becomes the maximum strength of the chain.

Crystallographic defects also affect the tube's electrical properties. A common result is lowered conductivity through the defective region of the tube. A defect in armchair-type tubes (which can conduct electricity) can cause the surrounding region to become semiconducting, and single monoatomic vacancies induce magnetic properties.&lt;ref&gt;Carbon-Based Magnetism: An Overview of the Magnetism of Metal Free Carbon-based Compounds and Materials, edited by Tatiana Makarova and Fernando Palacio (Elsevier 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

Crystallographic defects strongly affect the tube's thermal properties. Such defects lead to [[phonon]] scattering, which in turn increases the relaxation rate of the phonons. This reduces the [[mean free path]] and reduces the thermal conductivity of nanotube structures. Phonon transport simulations indicate that substitutional defects such as nitrogen or boron will primarily lead to scattering of high-frequency optical phonons. However, larger-scale defects such as [[Stone Wales defect]]s cause phonon scattering over a wide range of frequencies, leading to a greater reduction in thermal conductivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=N.|last=Mingo|year=2008|title=Phonon transmission through defects in carbon nanotubes from first principles|journal=Physical Review B|volume=77|page=033418|doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.77.033418|last2=Stewart|first2=D. A.|last3=Broido|first3=D. A.|last4=Srivastava|first4=D.|issue=3|bibcode = 2008PhRvB..77c3418M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===One-dimensional transport===
Because of the nanoscale dimensions, electrons propagate only along the tube's axis and electron transport involves many quantum effects. Because of this, carbon nanotubes are frequently referred to as “one-dimensional”.

===Toxicity===
The toxicity of carbon nanotubes has been an important question in nanotechnology. Such research has just begun.  The data are still fragmentary and subject to criticism.  Preliminary results highlight the difficulties in evaluating the toxicity of this heterogeneous material.  Parameters such as structure, size [[Frequency distribution|distribution]], [[surface area]], surface chemistry, [[surface charge]], and [[agglomeration]] state as well as purity of the samples, have considerable impact on the [[Reactivity (chemistry)|reactivity]] of carbon nanotubes. However, available data clearly show that, under some conditions, nanotubes can cross membrane barriers, which suggests that if raw materials reach the organs they can induce harmful effects such as inflammatory and fibrotic reactions.&lt;ref name=tox1&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kolosnjaj J, Szwarc H, Moussa F |title=Toxicity studies of carbon nanotubes |journal=Adv Exp Med Biol. |volume=620 |pages=181–204 |year=2007 |pmid=18217344 |doi=10.1007/978-0-387-76713-0_14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study led by Alexandra Porter from the [[University of Cambridge]] shows that CNTs can enter human cells and accumulate in the [[cytoplasm]], causing cell death.&lt;ref name=&quot;tox2&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Porter|first=Alexandra|title=Direct imaging of single-walled carbon nanotubes in cells|journal=Nature Nanotechnology|year=2007|volume=2|page=713|doi=10.1038/nnano.2007.347|last2=Gass|first2=Mhairi|last3=Muller|first3=Karin|last4=Skepper|first4=Jeremy N.|last5=Midgley|first5=Paul A.|last6=Welland|first6=Mark|pmid=18654411|issue=11|bibcode = 2007NatNa...2..713P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Results of rodent studies collectively show that regardless of the process by which CNTs were synthesized and the types and amounts of metals they contained, CNTs were capable of producing [[inflammation]], [[Granuloma|epithelioid granulomas]] (microscopic nodules), [[fibrosis]], and biochemical/toxicological changes in the lungs.&lt;ref&gt;Zumwalde, Ralph and Laura Hodson (March 2009).

National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. NIOSH (DHHS) Publication 2009-125.&lt;/ref&gt; Comparative toxicity studies in which mice were given equal weights of test materials showed that SWCNTs were more toxic than [[quartz]], which is considered a serious occupational health hazard when chronically inhaled. As a control, ultrafine [[carbon black]] was shown to produce minimal lung responses.&lt;ref name=tox3&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lam CW, James JT, McCluskey R, Arepalli S, Hunter RL |title=A review of carbon nanotube toxicity and assessment of potential occupational and environmental health risks |journal=Crit Rev Toxicol.|volume=36|pages=189–217 |year=2006 |pmid=16686422 |doi=10.1080/10408440600570233 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The needle-like fiber shape of CNTs is similar to [[asbestos fibers]].  This raises the idea that widespread use of carbon nanotubes may lead to [[mesothelioma]], which is a cancer of the lining of the lungs often caused by exposure to asbestos. A recently-published pilot study supports this prediction.&lt;ref name=&quot;tox5&quot;/&gt; Scientists exposed the [[mesothelial]] lining of the body cavity of mice to long multiwalled carbon nanotubes and observed asbestos-like, length-dependent, pathogenic behavior which included inflammation and formation of lesions known as [[granulomas]].
Authors of the study conclude:
:&quot;This is of considerable importance, because research and business communities continue to invest heavily in carbon nanotubes for a wide range of products under the assumption that they are no more hazardous than graphite. Our results suggest the need for further research and great caution before introducing such products into the market if long-term harm is to be avoided.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;tox5&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Poland|first=CA|title=Carbon nanotubes introduced into the abdominal cavity of mice show asbestos-like pathogenicity in a pilot study|journal=Nature Nanotechnology|year=2008|volume=3|page=423|doi=10.1038/nnano.2008.111|last2=Duffin|first2=Rodger|last3=Kinloch|first3=Ian|last4=Maynard|first4=Andrew|last5=Wallace|first5=William A.

According to co-author Dr. Andrew Maynard:
:&quot;This study is exactly the kind of strategic, highly focused research needed to ensure the safe and responsible development of nanotechnology. It looks at a specific nanoscale material expected to have widespread commercial applications and asks specific questions about a specific health hazard. Even though scientists have been raising concerns about the safety of long, thin carbon nanotubes for over a decade, none of the research needs in the current U.S. federal nanotechnology environment, health and safety risk research strategy address this question.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nanotechproject.org/news/archive/mwcnt/ Carbon Nanotubes That Look Like Asbestos, Behave Like Asbestos]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although further research is required, the available data suggests that under certain conditions, especially those involving chronic exposure, carbon nanotubes can pose a serious risk to human health.&lt;ref name=tox1/&gt;&lt;ref name=tox2/&gt;&lt;ref name=tox3/&gt;&lt;ref name=tox5/&gt;

==Synthesis==
[[Image:Mutr-nanotubes1.jpg|thumb|Powder of carbon nanotubes]]
Techniques have been developed to produce nanotubes in sizeable quantities, including [[Electric arc|arc discharge]], [[laser ablation]], high pressure carbon monoxide ([[HiPco]]), and [[chemical vapor deposition]] (CVD). Most of these processes take place in vacuum or with process gases. CVD growth of CNTs can occur in vacuum or at atmospheric pressure. Large quantities of nanotubes can be synthesized by these methods; advances in catalysis and continuous growth processes are making CNTs more commercially viable.

===Arc discharge===
Nanotubes were observed in 1991 in the carbon soot of graphite [[electrode]]s during an arc discharge, by using a current of 100 [[ampere|amps]], that was intended to produce fullerenes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Sumio|last=Iijima|year=1991|title=Helical microtubules of graphitic carbon|journal=Nature|volume=354|pages=56–58|doi=10.1038/354056a0|issue=6348|bibcode = 1991Natur.354...56I }}&lt;/ref&gt; However the first [[macroscopic]] production of carbon nanotubes was made in 1992 by two researchers at [[NEC]]'s Fundamental Research Laboratory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=T. W.|last=Ebbesen|year=1992|title=Large-scale synthesis of carbon nanotubes|journal=Nature|volume=358|pages=220–222|doi=10.1038/358220a0|last2=Ajayan|first2=P. M.|issue=6383|bibcode = 1992Natur.358..220E }}&lt;/ref&gt; The method used was the same as in 1991. During this process, the carbon contained in the negative electrode sublimates because of the high discharge temperatures. Because nanotubes were initially discovered using this technique, it has been the most widely-used method of nanotube synthesis.

The yield for this method is up to 30 percent by weight and it produces both single- and multi-walled nanotubes with lengths of up to 50 micrometers with few structural defects.&lt;ref name=&quot;nanotubes for electronics&quot; /&gt;

===Laser ablation===
In the laser ablation process, a [[pulsed laser]] vaporizes a graphite target in a high-temperature reactor while an [[inert gas]] is bled into the chamber. Nanotubes develop on the cooler surfaces of the reactor as the vaporized carbon condenses. A water-cooled surface may be included in the system to collect the nanotubes.

This process was developed by Dr. [[Richard Smalley]] and co-workers at [[Rice University]], who at the time of the discovery of carbon nanotubes, were blasting metals with a laser to produce various metal molecules. When they heard of the existence of nanotubes they replaced the metals with graphite to create multi-walled carbon nanotubes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guo|first=Ting|title=Self-Assembly of Tubular Fullerenes|url=http://www.pa.msu.edu/cmp/csc/eprint/DT085.pdf|year=1995|journal=J.

Phys. Lett.|year=1995|volume=243|pages=49–54|url=http://www.orgchem.science.ru.nl/molmat/mm-web/education/caput-college/ChemPhysLett-1995-243-49.pdf |format=PDF| doi=10.1016/0009-2614(95)00825-O|last2=Nikolaev|first2=P|last3=Thess|first3=A|last4=Colbert|first4=D|last5=Smalley|first5=R|bibcode = 1995CPL...243...49B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The laser ablation method yields around 70% and produces primarily single-walled carbon nanotubes with a controllable diameter determined by the reaction [[temperature]]. However, it is more expensive than either arc discharge or chemical vapor deposition.&lt;ref name=&quot;nanotubes for electronics&quot; /&gt;

===Chemical vapor deposition (CVD)===
[[Image:PICT0111.JPG|thumb|Nanotubes being grown by plasma enhanced [[chemical vapor deposition]]]]
The catalytic vapor phase deposition of carbon was first reported in 1959,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=P. L.|last=Walker Jr.|journal=J. Phys. Chem.|volume=63|pages=133|year=1959|title=Carbon Formation from Carbon Monoxide-Hydrogen Mixtures over Iron Catalysts. I.

R.|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it was not until 1993&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=M.|last=José-Yacamán|title=Catalytic growth of carbon microtubules with fullerene structure|journal=Appl. Phys. Lett.|volume=62|page=657|year=1993|doi=10.1063/1.108857|last2=Miki-Yoshida|first2=M.|last3=Rendón|first3=L.|last4=Santiesteban|first4=J. G.|issue=6|bibcode = 1993ApPhL..62..657J }}&lt;/ref&gt; that carbon nanotubes were formed by this process. In 2007, researchers at the [[University of Cincinnati]] (UC) developed a process to grow aligned carbon nanotube arrays of 18&amp;nbsp;mm length on a FirstNano ET3000 carbon nanotube growth system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=UC Researchers Shatter World Records with Length of Carbon Nanotube Arrays|date=2007-04-27|last=Beckman|first=Wendy|publisher=University of Cincinnati|url=http://www.uc.edu/news/NR.asp?id=5700}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During CVD, a substrate is prepared with a layer of metal catalyst particles, most commonly nickel, cobalt,&lt;ref&gt;N.

The diameters of the nanotubes that are to be grown are related to the size of the metal particles. This can be controlled by patterned (or masked) deposition of the metal, annealing, or by plasma etching of a metal layer. The substrate is heated to approximately 700°C. To initiate the growth of nanotubes, two gases are bled into the reactor: a process gas (such as [[ammonia]], [[nitrogen]] or [[hydrogen]]) and a carbon-containing gas (such as [[acetylene]], [[ethylene]], [[ethanol]] or [[methane]]). Nanotubes grow at the sites of the metal catalyst; the carbon-containing gas is broken apart at the surface of the catalyst particle, and the carbon is transported to the edges of the particle, where it forms the nanotubes. This mechanism is still being studied. The catalyst particles can stay at the tips of the growing nanotube during the growth process, or remain at the nanotube base, depending on the adhesion between the catalyst particle and the substrate. Thermal catalytic decomposition of hydrocarbon has become an active area of research and can be a promising route for the bulk production of CNTs. Fluidised bed reactor is the most widely used reactor for CNT preparation. Scale-up of the reactor is the major challenge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pinilla | first1 = JL | author-separator =, | author-name-separator=  | last2 = Moliner | first2 = R| year = 2007 | last3 = Suelves | first3 = I | last4 = Lazaro | first4 = M | last5 = Echegoyen | first5 = Y | last6 = Palacios | first6 = J | title = Production of hydrogen and carbon nanofibers by thermal decomposition of methane using metal catalysts in a fluidized bed reactor | url = | journal = International Journal of Hydrogen Energy | volume = 32 | issue = 18| page = 4821 | doi = 10.1016/j.ijhydene.2007.08.013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

CVD is a common method for the commercial production of carbon nanotubes. For this purpose, the metal nanoparticles are mixed with a catalyst support such as MgO or Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to increase the surface area for higher yield of the catalytic reaction of the carbon feedstock with the metal particles. One issue in this synthesis route is the removal of the catalyst support via an acid treatment, which sometimes could destroy the original structure of the carbon nanotubes. However, alternative catalyst supports that are soluble in water have proven effective for nanotube growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=A.|last=Eftekhari|title=High-yield synthesis of carbon nanotubes using a water-soluble catalyst support in catalytic chemical vapor deposition|doi=10.1016/j.carbon.2005.12.006|journal=Carbon|volume=44|page=1343|year=2006|last2=Jafarkhani|first2=P|last3=Moztarzadeh|first3=F|issue=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If a [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] is generated by the application of a strong electric field during the growth process (plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition*), then the nanotube growth will follow the direction of the electric field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Z. F.|last=Ren|title=Synthesis of Large Arrays of Well-Aligned Carbon Nanotubes on Glass|journal=Science|volume=282|page=1105|year=1998|doi=10.1126/science.282.5391.1105|pmid=9804545|last2=Huang|first2=ZP|last3=Xu|first3=JW|last4=Wang|first4=JH|last5=Bush|first5=P|last6=Siegal|first6=MP|last7=Provencio|first7=PN|issue=5391|bibcode = 1998Sci...282.1105R }}&lt;/ref&gt; By adjusting the geometry of the reactor it is possible to synthesize vertically aligned carbon nanotubes&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nano-lab.com/imagegallery.html SEM images &amp; TEM images of carbon nanotubes, aligned carbon nanotube arrays, and nanoparticles]&lt;/ref&gt; (i.e., perpendicular to the substrate), a morphology that has been of interest to researchers interested in the electron emission from nanotubes. Without the plasma, the resulting nanotubes are often randomly oriented. Under certain reaction conditions, even in the absence of a plasma, closely spaced nanotubes will maintain a vertical growth direction resulting in a dense array of tubes resembling a carpet or forest.

Of the various means for nanotube synthesis, CVD shows the most promise for industrial-scale deposition, because of its price/unit ratio, and because CVD is capable of growing nanotubes directly on a desired substrate, whereas the nanotubes must be collected in the other growth techniques. The growth sites are controllable by careful deposition of the catalyst. In 2007, a team from [[Meijo University]] demonstrated a high-efficiency CVD technique for growing carbon nanotubes from [[camphor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Carbon Nanotubes from Camphor: An Environment-Friendly Nanotechnology|journal=Journal of Physics: Conference Series|volume=61|year=2007| page=643|url=http://www.iop.org/EJ/article/1742-6596/61/1/129/jpconf7_61_129.pdf  |bibcode = 2007JPhCS..61..643K |doi = 10.1088/1742-6596/61/1/129 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers at Rice University, until recently led by the late [[Richard Smalley]], have concentrated upon finding methods to produce large, pure amounts of particular types of nanotubes. Their approach grows long fibers from many small seeds cut from a single nanotube; all of the resulting fibers were found to be of the same diameter as the original nanotube and are expected to be of the same type as the original nanotube.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Jade|last=Boyd|title=Rice chemists create, grow nanotube seeds|publisher=Rice University|date=2006-11-17|url=http://www.media.rice.edu/media/NewsBot.asp?MODE=VIEW&amp;ID=9070}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Super-growth CVD====
[[Image:CNTBB structure.jpg|thumb|SEM photo of SWNT forests produced by super-growth]]

Super-growth CVD (water-assisted chemical vapour deposition) process was developed by Kenji Hata, [[Sumio Iijima]] and co-workers at [[National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology|AIST]], Japan.&lt;ref&gt;

Dense millimeter-tall nanotube &quot;forests&quot;, aligned normal to the substrate, were produced. The forests growth rate could be expressed, as

: &lt;math&gt; H(t) = {\beta}{\tau}_o ({1 - e^{-t / {\tau}_o}}) .&lt;/math&gt;

In this equation, β is the initial growth rate and &lt;math&gt; {\tau}_o &lt;/math&gt; is the characteristic catalyst lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;

The time required to make SWNT forests of the height of 2.5&amp;nbsp;mm by this method was 10 minutes in 2004. Those SWNT forests can be easily separated from the catalyst, yielding clean SWNT material (purity &gt;99.98%) without further purification. For comparison, the as-grown HiPco CNTs contain about 5-35%&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Unidym product sheet SWNT|url=http://www.unidym.com/files/Unidym_Product_Sheet_SWNT.pdf  }}&lt;/ref&gt; of metal impurities; it is therefore purified through dispersion and centrifugation that damages the nanotubes. The super-growth process avoids this problem. Patterned highly organized single-walled nanotube structures were successfully fabricated using the super-growth technique.

The [[mass density]] of super-growth CNTs is about 0.037 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Characteristic of Carbon nanotubes by super-growth method|language=japanese|url=http://www.nanocarbon.jp/sg/002.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;K.Hata&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|author=K.Hata|title=From Highly Efficient Impurity-Free CNT Synthesis to DWNT forests, CNTsolids and Super-Capacitors|url=http://www.nanocarbon.jp/english/research/image/review.pdf  }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is much lower than that of conventional CNT powders (~1.34 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), probably because the latter contain metals and [[amorphous carbon]]. 

The super-growth method is basically a variation of CVD. Therefore, it is possible to grow material containing SWNT, DWNTs and MWNTs, and to alter their ratios by tuning the growth conditions.&lt;ref&gt;

The vertically aligned nanotube forests originate from a &quot;zipping effect&quot; when they are immersed in a solvent and dried. The zipping effect is caused by the surface tension of the solvent and the van der Waals forces between the carbon nanotubes. It aligns the nanotubes into a dense material, which can be formed in various shapes, such as sheets and bars, by applying weak compression during the process. Densification increases the [[Vickers hardness]] by about 70 times and density is 0.55 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. The packed carbon nanotubes are more than 1&amp;nbsp;mm long and have a carbon purity of 99.9% or higher; they also retain the desirable alignment properties of the nanotubes forest.&lt;ref&gt;

Many electronic applications of carbon nanotubes crucially rely on techniques of selectively producing either semiconducting or metallic CNTs, preferably of a certain chirality. Several methods of separating semiconducting and metallic CNTs are known, but most of them are not yet suitable for large-scale technological processes. The most efficient method relies on density-gradient ultracentrifugation which separates surfactant-wrapped nanotubes by the minute difference in their density. This density difference often translates into difference in the nanotube diameter and (semi)conducting properties.&lt;ref name=grad/&gt; Another method of separation uses a sequence of freezing, thawing, and compression of SWNTs embedded in [[agarose]] gel. This process results in a solution containing 70% metallic SWNTs and leaves a gel containing 95% semiconducting SWNTs. The diluted solutions separated by this method show various colors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Takeshi Tanaka ''et al.''|title=Simple and Scalable Gel-Based Separation of Metallic and Semiconducting Carbon Nanotubes|journal=[[Nano Letters]]|volume=9|pages=1497–1500|year=2009|doi=10.1021/nl8034866 |pmid=19243112 |issue=4|bibcode = 2009NanoL...9.1497T }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=T.Tanaka|title=New, Simple Method for Separation of Metallic and Semiconducting Carbon Nanotubes|url=http://www.aist.go.jp/aist_e/latest_research/2009/20090406/20090406.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, SWNTs can be separated by the [[column chromatography]] method.

In addition to separation of semiconducting and metallic SWNTs, it is possible to sort SWNTs by length, diameter, and chirality. The highest resolution length sorting, with length variation of &lt;10%, has thus far been achieved by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) of DNA-dispersed carbon nanotubes (DNA-SWNT).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Huang, X  ''et al.''|title=High-Resolution Length Sorting and Purification of DNA-Wrapped Carbon Nanotubes by Size-Exclusion Chromatography|journal=[[Anal.

An alternative to separation is development of a selective growth of semiconducting or metallic CNTs. Recently, a new CVD recipe was announced which involves a combination of ethanol and methanol gases and quartz substrates resulting in horizontally aligned arrays of 95–98% semiconducting nanotubes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/nl803496s|title=Selective Growth of Well-Aligned Semiconducting Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes|year=2009|last1=Ding|first1=Lei|last2=Tselev|first2=Alexander|last3=Wang|first3=Jinyong|last4=Yuan|first4=Dongning|last5=Chu|first5=Haibin|last6=McNicholas|first6=Thomas P.|last7=Li|first7=Yan|last8=Liu|first8=Jie|journal=Nano Letters|volume=9|pages=800–5|pmid=19159186|issue=2|bibcode = 2009NanoL...9..800D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nanotubes are usually grown on nanoparticles of magnetic metal (Fe, Co), which facilitates production of electronic ([[spintronic]]) devices. In particular control of current through a field-effect transistor by magnetic field has been demonstrated in such a single-tube nanostructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=M.A. Mohamed|title=Fabrication of spintronics device by direct synthesis of single-walled carbon nanotubes from ferromagnetic electrodes|journal=Sci.

==Current applications==
Current use and application of nanotubes has mostly been limited to the use of bulk nanotubes, which is a mass of rather unorganized fragments of nanotubes. Bulk nanotube materials may never achieve a tensile strength similar to that of individual tubes, but such composites may nevertheless yield strengths sufficient for many applications. Bulk carbon nanotubes have already been used as composite fibers in [[polymers]] to improve the mechanical, thermal and electrical properties of the bulk product.

The strength and flexibility of carbon nanotubes makes them of potential use in controlling other nanoscale structures, which suggests they will have an important role in [[nanotechnology]] engineering.

===Structural===
Because of the carbon nanotube's superior mechanical properties, many structures have been proposed ranging from everyday items like clothes and sports gear to combat jackets and [[space elevator]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Space Elevator|first=Brad C.|last=Edwards|publisher=BC Edwards|year=2003|isbn=0974651710}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the space elevator will require further efforts in refining carbon nanotube technology, as the practical tensile strength of carbon nanotubes can still be greatly improved.&lt;ref name=&quot;nanotubes for electronics&quot; /&gt;

For perspective, outstanding breakthroughs have already been made. Pioneering work led by Ray H. Baughman at the NanoTech Institute has shown that single and multi-walled nanotubes can produce materials with toughness unmatched in the man-made and natural worlds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zhang|first=Mei|title=Strong, Transparent, Multifunctional, Carbon Nanotube Sheets|journal=Science|year=2005|volume=309|pages=1215–1219|doi=10.1126/science.1115311|pmid=16109875|last2=Fang|first2=S|last3=Zakhidov|first3=AA|last4=Lee|first4=SB|last5=Aliev|first5=AE|last6=Williams|first6=CD|last7=Atkinson|first7=KR|last8=Baughman|first8=RH|issue=5738|bibcode = 2005Sci...309.1215Z }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dalton|first=Alan B.|title=Super-tough carbon-nanotube fibres|doi=10.1038/423703a|journal=Nature|year=2003|volume=423|page=703|last2=Su|first2=Tian|last3=Horng|first3=Tiffany|last4=Chow|first4=Amy|last5=Akira|first5=Shizuo|last6=Medzhitov|first6=Ruslan|pmid=18297073|issue=4|last7=Coleman|first7=Jonathan N.|last8=Kim|first8=Bog G.|last9=Baughman|first9=Ray H.|bibcode = 2003Natur.423..703D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carbon nanotubes are also a promising material as building blocks in bio-mimetic hierarchical composite materials given their exceptional mechanical properties (~1TPa in modulus, and ~100 GPa in strength). Initial attempts to incorporate CNTs into hierarchical structures lead to mechanical properties which were significantly lower than these achievable limits.  Windle et al. have used an ''in situ'' chemical vapor deposition (CVD) spinning method to produce continuous CNT yarns from CVD grown CNT aerogels&lt;ref&gt;P. Miaudet, S. Badaire, M. Maugey, A. Derre, V. Pichot, P. Launois, P. Poulin, C. Zakri, Nano Letters 2005, 5, 2212.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Y.-L. Li, I. Kinloch, A. Windle, Science 2004, 304, 276.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Motta, A. Moisala, I. Kinloch, A. Windle, Adv. Mater 2007, 19, 3721-3726.&lt;/ref&gt;. With this technology, they fabricated CNT yarns with strengths as high as ~9 GPa at small gage lengths of ~1 mm, however, defects resulted in a reduction of specific strength to ~1 GPa at 20 mm gage length&lt;ref&gt;M. Motta, A. Moisala, I. Kinloch, A. Windle, Adv. Mater 2007, 19, 3721-3726.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;K. L. Stano, K. Koziol, M. Pick, M. S. Motta, A. Moisala, J. J. Vilatela, S. Frasier, A. H. Windle, International Journal of Material Forming 2008, 1, 4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;K. Koziol, J. Vilatela, A. Moisala, M. Motta, P. Cunniff, M. Sennett, A. Windle, Science 2007, 318, 1892.&lt;/ref&gt;. Espinosa et al. developed high performance DWNT-polymer composite yarns by twisting and stretching ribbons of randomly oriented bundles of DWNTs thinly coated with polymeric organic compounds. These DWNT-polymer yarns exhibited ''unprecedented'' high energy to failure of ~100 Jg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; (comparable to one of the toughest natural materials – spider silk&lt;ref&gt;Y. Yang, X. Chen, Z. Shao, P. Zhou, D. Porter, D. P. Knight, F. Vollrath, Adv. Mater. 2005, 17.&lt;/ref&gt;), and strength as high as ~1.4 GPa&lt;ref&gt;M. Naraghi, T. Filleter, A. Moravsky, M. Locasio, R. O. Loufty, H. D. Espinosa, ACS Nano 2010, 4, 6463.&lt;/ref&gt;. Effort is ongoing to produce CNT composites which incorporate tougher matrix materials, such as Kevlar©, to further improve on the mechanical properties towards those of individual CNTs.

Because of the high mechanical strength of carbon nanotubes, research is being made into weaving them into clothes to create stab-proof and bulletproof clothing. The nanotubes would effectively stop the bullet from penetrating the body, although the bullet's kinetic energy would likely cause broken bones and internal bleeding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=T.|last=Yildirim|year=2000|title=Pressure-induced interlinking of carbon nanotubes|journal=[[Physical Review]] B|volume=62|pages=19|doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.62.12648|last2=Gülseren|first2=O.|last3=Kılıç|first3=Ç.|last4=Ciraci|first4=S.|issue=19|arxiv = cond-mat/0008476 |bibcode = 2000PhRvB..6212648Y }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In electrical circuits===
Nanotube-based [[transistor]]s, also known as [[carbon nanotube field-effect transistor]]s (CNFETs), have been made that operate at room temperature and that are capable of digital switching using a single electron.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Postma|first=Henk W.

In 2001 IBM researchers demonstrated how metallic nanotubes can be destroyed, leaving semiconducting ones behind for use as transistors. Their process is called &quot;constructive destruction&quot; which includes the automatic destruction of defective nanotubes on the [[wafer (electronics)|wafer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Philip G.|last=Collins|title=Engineering Carbon Nanotubes and Nanotube Circuits Using Electrical Breakdown|journal=Science|volume=292|year=2001|pages=706–709|doi=10.1126/science.1058782|pmid=11326094|last2=Arnold|first2=MS|last3=Avouris|first3=P|issue=5517|bibcode = 2001Sci...292..706C }}&lt;/ref&gt; This process, however, only gives control over the electrical properties on a statistical scale.

The potential of carbon nanotubes was demonstrated in 2003 when room-temperature ballistic transistors with ohmic metal contacts and [[High-k dielectric|high-k gate]] dielectric were reported, showing 20–30x higher ON current than state-of-the-art Si [[MOSFET]]s. This presented an important advance in the field as CNT was shown to potentially outperform Si. At the time, a major challenge was ohmic metal contact formation.

The first nanotube integrated memory circuit was made in 2004. One of the main challenges has been regulating the conductivity of nanotubes. Depending on subtle surface features a nanotube may act as a plain [[Electrical conductor|conductor]] or as a semiconductor. A fully automated method has however been developed to remove non-semiconductor tubes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Yu-Chih|last=Tseng|title=Monolithic Integration of Carbon Nanotube Devices with Silicon MOS Technology|journal=Nano Letters|volume=4|year=2004|pages=123–127|doi=10.1021/nl0349707|last2=Xuan|first2=Peiqi|last3=Javey|first3=Ali|last4=Malloy|first4=Ryan|last5=Wang|first5=Qian|last6=Bokor|first6=Jeffrey|last7=Dai|first7=Hongjie|author7-link=Hongjie Dai|bibcode = 2004NanoL...4..123T }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Large structures of carbon nanotubes can be used for thermal management of electronic circuits. An approximately 1&amp;nbsp;mm–thick carbon nanotube layer was used as a special material to fabricate coolers, this materials has very low density, ~20 times lower weight than a similar copper structure, while the cooling properties are similar for the two materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=K.

Overall, incorporating carbon nanotubes as transistors into logic-gate circuits with densities comparable to modern CMOS technology has not yet been demonstrated.

===As paper batteries===
A [[paper battery]] is a [[Battery (electricity)|battery]] engineered to use a paper-thin sheet of [[cellulose]] (which is the major constituent of regular paper, among other things) infused with aligned [[carbon nanotubes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2007-08/rpi-bbs080907.php|title=Beyond Batteries: Storing Power in a Sheet of Paper|publisher=Eurekalert.org|date =August 13, 2007|accessdate=2008-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nanotubes act as [[electrodes]]; allowing the storage devices to conduct electricity. The battery, which functions as both a lithium-ion battery and a [[supercapacitor]], can provide a long, steady power output comparable to a conventional battery, as well as a supercapacitor’s quick burst of high energy—and while a conventional battery contains a number of separate components, the paper battery integrates all of the battery components in a single structure, making it more energy efficient.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

===Solar cells===
Solar cells developed at the [[New Jersey Institute of Technology]] use a carbon nanotube complex, formed by a mixture of carbon nanotubes and carbon [[buckyball]]s (known as [[fullerene]]s) to form snake-like structures. Buckyballs trap electrons, although they can't make electrons flow. Add sunlight to excite the [[polymer]]s, and the buckyballs will grab the electrons. Nanotubes, behaving like copper wires, will then be able to make the electrons or current flow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/07/070719011151.htm|title=New Flexible Plastic Solar Panels Are Inexpensive And Easy To Make|publisher=ScienceDaily|date=July 19, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ultracapacitors===
MIT Laboratory for Electromagnetic and Electronic Systems uses nanotubes to improve [[ultracapacitors]]. The activated charcoal used in conventional ultracapacitors has many small hollow spaces of various size, which create together a large surface to store electric charge. But as charge is quantized into elementary charges, i.e. electrons, and each such elementary charge needs a minimum space, a significant fraction of the electrode surface is not available for storage because the hollow spaces are not compatible with the charge's requirements. With a nanotube electrode the spaces may be tailored to size—few too large or too small—and consequently the capacity should be increased considerably.&lt;ref name=&quot;MIT&quot;&gt;[http://lees.mit.edu/lees/battery_001.htm MIT LEES on Batteries]. MIT press release, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other applications===
[[File:AlignedCNTs.jpg|thumb|Aligned nanotubes are preferred for many applications.]]
Carbon nanotubes have been implemented in nanoelectromechanical systems, including mechanical memory elements ([[Nano-RAM|NRAM]] being developed by [[Nantero|Nantero Inc.]]) and nanoscale electric motors (see [[Nanomotor]] or [[Nanotube nanomotor]]).

In May 2005, Nanomix Inc placed on the market a hydrogen sensor which integrated carbon nanotubes on a silicon platform. Since then Nanomix has been patenting many such sensor applications such as in the field of carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, glucose, DNA detection, etc.

Researchers at Rice University, Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre and University of California, Riverside have shown that carbon nanotubes and their polymer nanocomposites are suitable scaffold materials for bone cell proliferation &lt;ref name=&quot;http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/nl051861e&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Haddon|first=Robert C.|coauthors=Laura P.

[[Eikos|Eikos Inc]] of [[Franklin, Massachusetts|Franklin]], [[Massachusetts]] and Unidym Inc. of [[Silicon Valley]], California are developing transparent, electrically conductive films of carbon nanotubes to replace [[indium tin oxide]] (ITO). Carbon nanotube films are substantially more mechanically robust than ITO films, making them ideal for high-reliability [[touchscreen]]s and flexible displays. Printable water-based inks of carbon nanotubes are desired to enable the production of these films to replace ITO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Simmons |first=Trevor |year=2007 |title=Large Area-Aligned Arrays from Direct Deposition of Single-Wall Carbon Nanotubes |journal=J. Am. Chem. Soc.|volume=129|pages=10088–10089|doi=10.1021/ja073745e |pmid=17663555 |last2=Hashim |first2=D |last3=Vajtai |first3=R |last4=Ajayan |first4=PM |issue=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nanotube films show promise for use in displays for computers, cell phones, [[Personal digital assistant|PDAs]], and [[Automated teller machine|ATMs]].

A [[nanoradio]], a radio receiver consisting of a single nanotube, was demonstrated in 2007. In 2008 it was shown that a sheet of nanotubes can operate as a loudspeaker if an alternating current is applied. The sound is not produced through vibration but [[thermoacoustics|thermoacoustically]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://technology.newscientist.com/article/dn15098-hot-nanotube-sheets-produce-music-on-demand.html Hot nanotube sheets produce music on demand], ''New Scientists News'', 31 October 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[flywheel]] made of carbon nanotubes could be spun at extremely high velocity on a floating magnetic axis in a vacuum, and potentially store energy at a [[Energy density|density]] approaching that of conventional fossil fuels. Since energy can be added to and removed from flywheels very efficiently in the form of electricity, this might offer a way of [[Grid energy storage|storing electricity]], making the electrical grid more efficient and variable power suppliers (like wind turbines) more useful in meeting energy needs. The practicality of this depends heavily upon the cost of making massive, unbroken nanotube structures, and their failure rate under stress.

Ultra-short SWNTs (US-tubes) have been used as nanoscaled capsules for delivering MRI contrast agents in vivo.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.future-science.com/doi/abs/10.4155/fmc.10.3 Nanotechnology and MRI contrast enhancement], Future Medicinal Chemistry March 2010, Vol. 2, No. 3, Pages 491-502&lt;/ref&gt;

Nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes may replace [[platinum]] catalysts used to reduce oxygen in [[fuel cell]]s. A forest of vertically-aligned nanotubes can reduce oxygen in alkaline solution more effectively than platinum, which has been used in such applications since the 1960s. The nanotubes have the added benefit of not being subject to carbon monoxide poisoning.&lt;ref&gt;[[Chemical &amp; Engineering News]], 9 February 2009, &quot;Nanotube Catalysts&quot;, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery==
{{See also|Timeline of carbon nanotubes}}
A 2006 editorial written by Marc Monthioux and Vladimir Kuznetsov in the journal ''Carbon'' described the interesting and often misstated origin of the carbon nanotube. A large percentage of academic and popular literature attributes the discovery of hollow, nanometer-size tubes composed of graphitic carbon to [[Sumio Iijima]] of [[NEC]] in 1991.&lt;ref name=&quot;carbon&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Who should be given the credit for the discovery of carbon nanotubes?|doi=10.1016/j.carbon.2006.03.019|first=Marc|last=Monthioux|journal=Carbon|volume=44|year=2006|url=http://www.cemes.fr/fichpdf/GuestEditorial.pdf |format=PDF|page=1621|last2=Kuznetsov|first2=V|issue=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1952 L. V. Radushkevich and V. M. Lukyanovich published clear images of 50 nanometer diameter tubes made of carbon in the Soviet ''Journal of Physical Chemistry''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Радушкевич|first=Л. В.|year=1952|title=О Структуре Углерода, Образующегося При Термическом Разложении Окиси Углерода На Железном Контакте|journal=Журнал Физической Химии|volume=26|pages=88–95|url=http://carbon.phys.msu.ru/publications/1952-radushkevich-lukyanovich.pdf|format=PDF|language=Russian}}(dead link)&lt;/ref&gt; This discovery was largely unnoticed, as the article was published in the Russian language, and Western scientists' access to Soviet press was limited during the [[Cold War]]. It is likely that carbon nanotubes were produced before this date, but the invention of the [[transmission electron microscope]] (TEM) allowed direct visualization of these structures.

Carbon nanotubes have been produced and observed under a variety of conditions prior to 1991. A paper by Oberlin, Endo, and Koyama published in 1976 clearly showed hollow carbon fibers with nanometer-scale diameters using a vapor-growth technique.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Filamentous growth of carbon through benzene decomposition|doi=10.1016/0022-0248(76)90115-9|first=A.|last=Oberlin|year=1976|volume=32|pages=335–349|journal=Journal of Crystal Growth|issue=3|bibcode = 1976JCrGr..32..335O }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the authors show a TEM image of a nanotube consisting of a single wall of graphene. Later, Endo has referred to this image as a single-walled nanotube.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Carbon Fibers and Carbon Nanotubes (Interview, Nagano, Japan)| last=Endo|first=Morinobu|last2=Dresselhaus|first2=M. S.|date=October 26, 2002|url=http://web.mit.edu/tinytech/Nanostructures/Spring2003/MDresselhaus/i789.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979 John Abrahamson presented evidence of carbon nanotubes at the 14th Biennial Conference of Carbon at [[Pennsylvania State University]]. The conference paper described carbon nanotubes as carbon fibers which were produced on carbon anodes during arc discharge. A characterization of these fibers was given as well as hypotheses for their growth in a nitrogen atmosphere at low pressures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Structure of Carbon Fibers Found on Carbon Arc Anodes|journal=Carbon|volume=37|year=1999|pages=1873|last=Abrahamson|first=John|last2=Wiles|first2=Peter G.|last3=Rhoades|first3=Brian L.|doi=10.1016/S0008-6223(99)00199-2|issue=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981 a group of Soviet scientists published the results of chemical and structural characterization of carbon nanoparticles produced by a thermocatalytical disproportionation of carbon monoxide. Using TEM images and [[X-ray scattering techniques|XRD]] patterns, the authors suggested that their “carbon multi-layer tubular crystals” were formed by rolling graphene layers into cylinders. They speculated that by rolling graphene layers into a cylinder, many different arrangements of graphene hexagonal nets are possible. They suggested two possibilities of such arrangements: circular arrangement (armchair nanotube) and a spiral, helical arrangement (chiral tube).&lt;ref&gt;Izvestiya Akademii Nauk SSSR, Metals. 1982, #3, pp.12–17 (in Russian)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, Howard G. Tennett of Hyperion Catalysis was issued a U.S. patent for the production of &quot;cylindrical discrete carbon fibrils&quot; with a &quot;constant diameter between about 3.5 and about 70&amp;nbsp;nanometers..., length 10&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; times the diameter, and an outer region of multiple essentially continuous layers of ordered carbon atoms and a distinct inner core....&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Ref patent|country=US|number=4663230|title=Carbon fibrils, method for producing same and compositions containing same|gdate=1987-05-05|fdate=1984-12-06|invent1=Tennent, Howard G.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Iijima's discovery of multi-walled carbon nanotubes in the insoluble material of arc-burned graphite rods in 1991&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Sumio|last=Iijima|title=Helical microtubules of graphitic carbon|journal=Nature|volume=354|pages=56–58|date=7 November 1991|doi=10.1038/354056a0|issue=6348|bibcode = 1991Natur.354...56I }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Mintmire, Dunlap, and White's independent prediction that if single-walled carbon nanotubes could be made, then they would exhibit remarkable conducting properties &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=J.W.|last=Mintmire|title=Are Fullerene Tubules Metallic?|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=68|pages=631–634|year=1992|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.68.631|pmid=10045950|last2=Dunlap|first2=BI|last3=White|first3=CT|issue=5|bibcode=1992PhRvL..68..631M}}&lt;/ref&gt; helped create the initial buzz that is now associated with carbon nanotubes. Nanotube research accelerated greatly following the independent discoveries&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=D.

The arc discharge technique was well-known to produce the famed Buckminster fullerene on a preparative scale,&lt;ref name=&quot;Kratschmer-C60&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|first=W.|last=Krätschmer|year=1990|title=Solid C60: a new form of carbon|journal=Nature|volume=347|pages=354–358|doi=10.1038/347354a0|last2=Lamb|first2=Lowell D.|last3=Fostiropoulos|first3=K.|last4=Huffman|first4=Donald R.|issue=6291|bibcode = 1990Natur.347..354K }}&lt;/ref&gt; and these results appeared to extend the run of accidental discoveries relating to fullerenes. The original observation of fullerenes in mass spectrometry was not anticipated,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=H. W.|last=Kroto|year=1985|title=C60: Buckminsterfullerene|doi=10.1038/318162a0|journal=Nature|volume=318|pages=162–163|last2=Heath|first2=J. R.|last3=O'Brien|first3=S. C.|last4=Curl|first4=R. F.|last5=Smalley|first5=R. E.|issue=6042|bibcode = 1985Natur.318..162K }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the first mass-production technique by Krätschmer and Huffman was used for several years before realizing that it produced fullerenes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kratschmer-C60&quot; /&gt;

The discovery of nanotubes remains a contentious issue. Many believe that Iijima's report in 1991 is of particular importance because it brought carbon nanotubes into the awareness of the scientific community as a whole.&lt;ref name=&quot;carbon&quot;/&gt;

The Czech Republic has been a member of [[NATO]] since 1999 and of the [[European Union]] since 2004. The Czech Republic is also a member of the [[Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe]] (OSCE). As an OSCE participating State, the Czech Republic’s international commitments are subject to monitoring under the mandate of the [[U.S. Helsinki Commission]]. From 1 January 2009 to 30 June 2009, the Czech Republic held the [[Presidency of the Council of the European Union]].

The Czech state, or [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown]] as it was known until 1918, was formed in the late 9th century. The country reached its greatest territorial extent during the 13th and 14th century, under the rule of the [[Přemyslid]] and [[House of Luxembourg|Luxembourg]] dynasties. Following the [[Battle of Mohács]] in 1526, the Kingdom of Bohemia was integrated into the [[Habsburg monarchy]] as one of its three principal parts{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} alongside Austria and Hungary. The independent Republic of [[Czechoslovakia]] was formed in 1918, following the collapse of the [[Austro-Hungarian empire]] after World War I. After the [[Munich Agreement]] (signed by [[Nazi Germany]], [[France]], [[United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland|Britain]] and [[Italy]]), [[Zaolzie#Part of Poland (1938–1939)|Polish annexation of Zaolzie]] and [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia]] and the consequent disillusion with the Western response and gratitude for the liberation of the major portion of Czechoslovakia by the [[Soviet Union|Red Army]], the [[Communist Party of Czechoslovakia|Communist]] party won plurality (38%)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.libri.cz/databaze/dejiny/text/t98.html Libri.cz] {{cs icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Czechoslovakian parliamentary election, 1946|1946 elections]].

In a 1948 coup d'état, Czechoslovakia became a communist-ruled state. In 1968, the increasing dissatisfaction culminated in attempts to reform the communist regime. The events, known as the [[Prague Spring]] of 1968, ended with an invasion by the armies of the [[Warsaw Pact]] countries (with the exception of [[Romania]]); the troops remained in the country until the 1989 [[Velvet Revolution]], when the communist regime collapsed. On 1 January 1993, Czechoslovakia [[Dissolution of Czechoslovakia|peacefully dissolved]] into its constituent states, the Czech Republic and [[Slovakia]].

The Czech Republic is a pluralist multi-party [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] [[representative democracy]]. President [[Václav Klaus]] is the current head of state. The [[List of Prime Ministers of the Czech Republic|Prime Minister]] is the [[head of government]] (currently [[Petr Nečas]]). The Parliament has two chambers: the [[Chamber of Deputies of the Czech Republic|Chamber of Deputies]] and the [[Senate of the Czech Republic|Senate]]. It is also a member of the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD), the [[Council of Europe]] and the [[Visegrád Group]].

The Czech Republic made economic reforms such as fast [[privatization]]s. Annual [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) growth stood at around 6% until the outbreak of the recent [[financial crisis of 2007–2010|global economic crisis]]. The country is the first former member of the [[Comecon]] to achieve the status of a [[developed country]] according to the [[World Bank]] (2006).&lt;ref name=&quot;worldbank06&quot;&gt;{{Cite web| last = Velinger| first = Jan | title = World Bank Marks Czech Republic's Graduation to 'Developed' Status | publisher=Radio Prague| url = http://www.radio.cz/en/article/76314| date = 28 February 2006| accessdate = 22 January 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, The Czech Republic has the highest [[human development index|human development]] in [[Eastern Europe]],&lt;ref name=&quot;hdi09&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/HDR_2009_EN_Complete.pdf |title=UNDP.org |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=25 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ranking as a &quot;Very High Human Development&quot; nation.

==Etymology==
{{Main|Name of the Czech Republic}}
The current Czech Republic comprises 3 historical lands: [[Bohemia]] (Čechy) in the West, [[Moravia]] (Morava) in the South-East, and [[Czech Silesia]] (Slezsko; the smaller, south-eastern part of [[Silesia|historical Silesia]], most of which is located within modern [[Poland]]) in the North-East. Jointly, these historic regions are described as &quot;Czech lands&quot; (former &quot;Lands of the Bohemian Crown&quot;), with the Czech language being spoken in all three. When the Czech nation regained its independence in 1918, the new state of ''Czechoslovakia'' was constituted to reflect the union of the Czech and Slovak territories that were merged together after World War I (in addition, a [[Carpathian Ruthenia|small western part]] of present Ukraine was included as well).

The word ''Czech'' itself came into English later via [[Polish language|Polish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/view/entry/m_en_gb0201690#m_en_gb0201690 |title=Oxford English Dictionary |publisher=Askoxford.com |date= |accessdate=4 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current English spelling is similar to an antiquated Czech spelling (''Cžechy'', ''Cžech''), however it is unlike the modern ''Čechy'' and ''Česko''. This discrepancy arises from a 15th century [[Orthographia Bohemica|reform]] of Czech priest Magister [[John Huss]].

Following the dissolution of [[Czechoslovakia]] at the end of 1992, the Czech part of the former nation found itself without a common single-word name in English. In 1993, the Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs suggested the name '''Czechia''' as an official alternative in all situations other than formal official documents and the full names of government institutions; however, this has not become widespread in English, even though most other languages have single-word names for the country (usually their own variants of &quot;Czechia&quot;).

== History ==
{{Main|History of the Czech lands}}

===Prehistory===
Archaeologists have found evidence of prehistoric human settlements in the area, dating back to the [[Neolithic]] era. In the [[classical era]], from the 3rd century BC [[Celts|Celtic]] migrations, the [[Boii]] (see [[Bohemia]]) and later in the 1st century, Germanic tribes of [[Marcomanni]] and [[Quadi]] settled there. During the [[Migration Period]] around the 5th century, many Germanic tribes moved westwards and southwards out of Central Europe.

[[Slavic people]] from the [[Black Sea]] and [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathian]] regions settled in the area (a movement that was also stimulated by the onslaught of peoples from Siberia and Eastern Europe: [[Huns]], [[Eurasian Avars|Avars]], [[Bulgars]] and [[Hungarian people|Magyars]]). Following in the Germans' wake, they moved southwards into Bohemia, Moravia and some of present day Austria. During the 7th century, the Frankish merchant, [[Samo]], supporting the Slavs fighting their Avar rulers, became the ruler of the first known Slav state in Central Europe. The Moravian principality arose in the 8th century (see [[Great Moravia]]).

===Bohemia===
[[Image:Premysl2Gelnhausen.jpg|thumb|upright|Ottokar II Přemysl at miniature from Gulhausen kodex.]]

The [[History of the Czech lands|Bohemian or Czech state]] emerged in the late 9th century, when it was unified by the [[Přemyslid dynasty]]. The kingdom of [[Bohemia]] was, as the only one kingdom in the Empire, a significant regional power during the [[Middle Ages]]. It was part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] during the entire existence of that confederation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.czech.cz/en/czech-republic/history/all-about-czech-history/the-premyslid-dynasty/ The Přemyslid Dynasty – Czech republic]{{Dead link|date=April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1212, King [[Ottokar I of Bohemia|Přemysl Otakar I]] (1198–1230), bearing the title “king“ already since 1198, extracted a [[Golden Bull of Sicily]] (a formal edict) from the emperor, confirming the royal title for Otakar and his descendants. The 13th century was also a period of large-scale [[Germans|German]] immigration. The Germans populated towns and mining districts on the Bohemian periphery and, in some cases, formed German colonies in the interior of the Czech lands. In 1235, the mighty [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] army launched an [[Mongol invasion of Europe|invasion of Europe]] and after the [[Battle of Legnica]], the Mongols carried their devastating raid into [[Moravia]], but they were beaten by the Czech royal army in a batte of Olomouc and contunied into Hungarian Lands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.impub.co.uk/dlug3.html |title=The Annals of Jan Dlugosz |publisher=Impub.co.uk |date= |accessdate=25 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

King [[Ottokar II of Bohemia|Přemysl Otakar II]] (1253–1278) earned the nickname of &quot;the King of Gold and Iron&quot; due to his military power and wealth. He acquired Austria, Styria and Carinthia thus spreading the Bohemian territory to the Adriatic sea. He met his death at the [[Battle on the Marchfeld]] in 1278, in a war with his rival, the Roman king [[Rudolph I of Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archiv.radio.cz/history/history03.html |title=The rise and fall of the Przemyslid Dynasty |publisher=Archiv.radio.cz |date= |accessdate=25 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ottokar's son [[Wenceslaus II of Bohemia|Wenceslaus II]] acquired the Polish crown in 1300 for himself and the Hungarian crown for his son. In 1306, the las King of Přemyslid line was murder by two polish assassins in Olomouc and, after a series of dynastic wars, the [[House of Luxembourg]] gained the Bohemian crown.

The 14th century, particularly the reign of [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] (1342–1378), is considered the Golden Age of Czech history. Of particular significance was the founding of [[Charles University in Prague]] in 1348. The [[Black Death]], which had raged in Europe from 1347 to 1352, decimated the Kingdom of Bohemia in 1380,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.arts.gla.ac.uk/Slavonic/Czech_Hist4.html |title=The flowering and the decline of the Czech medieval state |publisher=Arts.gla.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=25 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; killing about 10% of the population.&lt;ref&gt;''&quot;[http://books.google.com/books?id=3u3rNCWtv0MC&amp;pg=PA49&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Plague epidemics in Czech countries]&quot;''. E. Strouhal. p.49.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 15th century, the religious and social reformer [[Jan Hus]] formed a movement, later named after him. Although Hus was named a heretic and burnt in Constanz in 1415, his followers seceded from the Catholic Church and in the [[Hussite Wars]] (1419–1434) defeated five crusades organized against them by the Holy Roman Emperor [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]]. [[Petr Chelčický]] continued with Czech Hussite Reformation movement.

During the next two centuries, 90% of the inhabitants converted to the Hussite form of Protestantism. After 1526 Bohemia came increasingly under [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] control as the Habsburgs became first the elected and then the hereditary rulers of Bohemia. The [[Defenestration of Prague]] and subsequent revolt against the Habsburgs in 1618 marked the start of the [[Thirty Years' War]], which quickly spread throughout Central Europe. In 1620, the rebellion in Bohemia was crushed at the [[Battle of White Mountain]] and the ties between Bohemia and Habsburgs' hereditary lands in Austria were strengthened. The war had a devastating effect on the local population; the people were given the choice either to convert to Catholicism or leave the country.

[[File:Schlacht-Kolin-1.jpg|thumb|Frederick II of Prussia was defeated in the [[Battle of Kolin]], as a result of which he had to evacuate Bohemia.]]

The following period, from 1620 to the late 18th century, has been often called the &quot;Dark Age&quot;. The population of the Czech lands declined by a third due to war, disease, famine and the expulsion of the Protestant Czechs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.czech.cz/en/czech-republic/history/all-about-czech-history/the-thirty-years-war/ Czech.cz], The Thirty Years' War – Czech republic&lt;/ref&gt; The Habsburgs banned all religions other than Catholicism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archiv.radio.cz/history_96/history07.html |title=RP's History Online – Habsburgs |publisher=Archiv.radio.cz |date= |accessdate=25 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]] and [[Crimean Khanate|Tatars]] invaded Moravia in 1663,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;''[http://books.google.com/books?id=j08L5xLOQKwC&amp;pg=PA557&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false History of the Mongols from the 9th to the 19th Century.

The reigns of [[Maria Theresa of Austria]] (1740–80) and her son [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] (1780–90), Holy Roman Emperor and co-regent from 1765, were characterized by [[enlightened absolutism]]. In 1742, most of [[Silesia]], then the possession of the Bohemian crown, was seized by King [[Frederick II of Prussia]] in the [[War of the Austrian Succession]]. The [[Famines in Czech lands|Great Famine]], which lasted from 1770 until 1771, killed about one tenth of the Czech population, or 250,000 inhabitants, and radicalized countrysides leading to peasant uprisings.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;''The Cambridge economic history of Europe: The economic organization of early modern Europe''&quot;.

After the fall of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], Bohemia became part of the [[Austrian Empire]] and later of [[Austria–Hungary]]. [[Serfdom]] was not completely abolished until 1848. After the [[Revolutions of 1848]], Emperor [[Franz Josef I of Austria]] instituted an [[absolute monarchy|absolute monarch]] in an effort to balance competing ethnic interests in the empire.

This new country incorporated regions of [[Bohemia]], [[Moravia]], [[Czech Silesia|Silesia]], [[Slovakia]] and the [[Carpathian Ruthenia]] (known as the Subcarpathian Rus at the time) with significant [[Germans in Czechoslovakia (1918–1938)|German]], [[Hungarians in Slovakia|Hungarian]], [[Polish minority in the Czech Republic|Polish]] and [[Ruthenia]]n speaking minorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Tab. 3 Národnost československých státních příslušníků podle žup a zemí k 15.2.1921|url=http://www.czso.cz/sldb/sldb.nsf/i/8BE4678613181F2AC1256E66004C77DD/$File/tab3_21.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=[[Czech Statistical Office]]|language=Czech|accessdate=2 June 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070605105429/http://www.czso.cz/sldb/sldb.nsf/i/8BE4678613181F2AC1256E66004C77DD/$File/tab3_21.pdf |archivedate = 5 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tomáš G Masaryk1918.jpg|thumb|right|185px|[[Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk]], first president of [[Czechoslovakia]].]]
Although Czechoslovakia was a [[unitary state]], it provided what were at the time rather extensive rights to its minorities. However, it did not grant its minorities any territorial political autonomy. The failure to do so resulted in discontent and strong support among some of the minorities for a break from Czechoslovakia. [[Adolf Hitler]] took advantage of this opportunity and, supported by [[Konrad Henlein]]'s [[Sudeten German Party]], gained the largely [[Germans in Czechoslovakia (1918–1938)|German]] speaking [[Sudetenland]] (and its substantial [[Maginot Line]] like [[Czechoslovak border fortifications|border fortifications]]), through the 1938 [[Munich Agreement]]. Poland annexed the [[Zaolzie]] area around [[Český Těšín]]. [[Hungary]] gained parts of Slovakia and the Subcarpathian Rus as a result of the [[First Vienna Award]] in November 1938.

The remainders of Slovakia and the Subcarpathian Rus gained greater autonomy, with the state renamed to &quot;Czecho-Slovakia&quot; (The Second Republic; see [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia]]). After Nazi Germany threatened to annex part of Slovakia, allowing the remaining regions to be partitioned by Hungary and Poland, Slovakia chose to maintain its national and territorial integrity, seceding from Czecho-Slovakia in March 1939, and allying itself, as demanded by Germany, with Hitler's coalition.&lt;ref&gt;Gerhard L. Weinberg, ''The Foreign Policy of Hitler's Germany: Starting World War II, 1937–1939'' (Chicago, 1980), pp. 470–481.&lt;/ref&gt;

The remaining Czech territory was occupied by Germany, which transformed it into the so-called [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]]. The Protectorate was proclaimed part of the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]] and the President and Prime Minister were subordinate to the Nazi ''[[Protector (title)|Reichsprotektor]]'' (&quot;imperial protector&quot;). Subcarpathian Rus declared independence as the Republic of [[Carpatho-Ukraine]] on 15 March 1939, but was invaded by Hungary the same day and formally annexed the next day. Approximately 345,000 Czechoslovak citizens, including 277,000 Jews, were killed or executed, while hundreds of thousands of others were sent to prisons and [[Internment|concentration camps]] or used as forced labour. Perhaps two–thirds of the Czech nation was destined either for extermination or removal.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen A. Garrett (1996). &quot;''[http://books.google.com/books?id=lF9NBUZlh0AC&amp;pg=PA60&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Conscience and power: an examination of dirty hands and political leadership]''&quot;. Palgrave Macmillan. p.60. ISBN 0312159080&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Nazism|Nazi]] concentration camp existed at [[Terezín]], to the north of Prague.

There was [[Czech resistance to Nazi occupation]], both at home and abroad, most notably with the assassination of Nazi leader [[Reinhard Heydrich]] in a Prague suburb on 27 May 1942. The [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia#Czechoslovak Government-in-Exile|Czechoslovak government-in-exile]] and its army fighting against the Germans were acknowledged by the Allies; Czechoslovak troops fought in the UK, North Africa, the Middle East and the [[Soviet Union]]. The German occupation ended on 9 May 1945, with the arrival of the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] and American armies and the [[Prague uprising]]. An estimated 140,000 Soviet soldiers died in the fighting for the liberation of Czechoslovakia.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;''[http://books.google.com/books?id=JyN0hlKcfTcC&amp;pg=PA409&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false A Companion to Russian History]''&quot;. Abbott Gleason (2009). Wiley-Blackwell. p.409. ISBN 1-4051-3560-3&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1945–1946, almost the entire German minority in Czechoslovakia, about 2.7&amp;nbsp;million people, [[Expulsion of Germans after World War II#Czechoslovakia|were expelled]] to Germany and [[Austria]]. During this time, thousands of Germans were held in prisons and detention camps, or used as forced labour. In the summer of 1945, there were several massacres. The only Germans not expelled were some 250,000, who had been active in the resistance against the Nazis or were considered economically important, though many of these emigrated later. Following a Soviet-organised referendum, the Subcarpathian Rus never returned under Czechoslovak rule, but became part of the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]], as the [[Zakarpattia Oblast]] in 1946.

Czechoslovakia uneasily tried to play the role of a &quot;bridge&quot; between the West and East. However, the [[Communist Party of Czechoslovakia]] rapidly increased in popularity, with a general disillusionment with the West, due to the pre-war [[Munich Agreement]], and a favourable popular attitude towards the [[Soviet Union]], due to the Soviets' role in liberating Czechoslovakia from German rule. In the [[Czechoslovakian parliamentary election, 1946|1946 elections]], the Communists gained 38% of the votes and became the largest party in the Czechoslovak parliament. They formed a coalition government with other parties of the [[National Front (Czechoslovakia)|National Front]] and moved quickly to consolidate power. The decisive step took place in February 1948, during a series of events characterized by Communists as a &quot;revolution&quot; and by anti-Communists as a &quot;takeover&quot;, the Communist [[People's Militias (Czechoslovakia)|People's Militias]] secured control of key locations in Prague, and a new, all-Communist government was formed.

[[File:Memorial lidice children (2007)-commons.JPG|thumb|A memorial to 82 [[Lidice]] children killed by the Nazis in Chelmno.]]

For the next 41 years, Czechoslovakia was a Communist state within the [[Eastern Bloc]] (see [[History of Czechoslovakia (1948–1989)]]). This period was marked by a variety of social developments. The Communist government completely [[Nationalization|nationalized]] the [[means of production]] and established a [[Planned economy|command economy]]. The economy grew rapidly during the 1950s and 1960s, but slowed down in the 1970s, with increasing problems during the 1980s. The political climate was highly repressive during the 1950s, including numerous [[show trial]]s, but became more open and tolerant in the 1960s, culminating in [[Alexander Dubček]]'s leadership in the 1968 [[Prague Spring]], which tried to create &quot;socialism with a human face&quot; and perhaps even introduce political [[pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralism]]. This was forcibly ended by 21 August 1968 [[Warsaw Pact]] invasion.

The invasion was followed by a harsh program of &quot;[[Normalization (Czechoslovakia)|Normalization]]&quot; in the late 1960s and the 1970s. Until 1989, the political establishment relied on censorship of the opposition, though using more &quot;carrot&quot; than &quot;whip&quot; to secure the populace's passivity. Dissidents published [[Charter 77]] in 1977 and the first of a new wave of protests were seen in 1988. Between 1948 and 1989 more than 250,000 Czechs and Slovaks were sent to prison for &quot;anti-state activities&quot;, and over 400,000 emigrated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4388764.stm Czech schools revisit communism].

[[File:Tratado de Lisboa 13 12 2007 (081).jpg|thumb|right|The Czech Republic became a member of the European Union in 2004, signed the [[Lisbon Treaty]] in 2007 and [[Signing of the Treaty of Lisbon|ratified]] it in 2009 as the last EU member.]]

=== Velvet revolution and independence ===
{{main|Velvet Revolution}}
In November 1989, Czechoslovakia returned to a liberal democracy through the peaceful &quot;[[Velvet Revolution]]&quot;. However, Slovak national aspirations strengthened and on 1 January 1993, the [[Dissolution of Czechoslovakia|country peacefully split]] into the independent Czech Republic and [[Slovakia]]. Both countries went through economic reforms and [[privatisation]]s, with the intention of creating a [[capitalism|capitalist economy]]. This process was largely successful, as in 2006, the Czech Republic was recognised by the World Bank as a &quot;developed country&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;worldbank06&quot;/&gt; and in 2009, the [[Human Development Index]] ranked it as a nation of &quot;Very High Human Development&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;hdi09&quot;/&gt;

From 1991, the Czech Republic, originally as part of Czechoslovakia and now in its own right, has been a member of the [[Visegrád Group]] and from 1995, the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]]. The Czech Republic joined [[NATO]] on 12 March 1999 and the European Union on 1 May 2004. It held the [[Presidency of the Council of the European Union|Presidency of the European Union]] for the first half of 2009.

== Politics ==
{{Main|Politics of the Czech Republic}}
[[File:Václav Havel.jpg|thumb|right|205px|[[Václav Havel]], the first President of the Czech Republic.]]
[[File:Vaclav Klaus headshot.jpg|thumb|170px|[[Václav Klaus]], current President of the Czech Republic.]]

The Czech Republic is a pluralist multi-party [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] [[representative democracy]], with the [[List of Prime Ministers of the Czech Republic|Prime Minister]] as [[head of government]]. The [[Parliament of the Czech Republic|Parliament]] (''Parlament České republiky'') is bicameral, with the [[Chamber of Deputies of the Czech Republic|Chamber of Deputies]] ({{lang-cs|Poslanecká sněmovna}}) (200 members) and the [[Senate of the Czech Republic|Senate]] (''Senát'') (81 members).

The [[President of the Czech Republic]] is selected by a joint session of the parliament for a five-year term, with no more than two consecutive terms. The president is a formal [[head of state]] with limited specific powers, most importantly to return bills to the parliament, nominate [[Constitutional court]] judges for the Senate's approval and dissolve the parliament under certain special and unusual circumstances. He also appoints the [[List of Prime Ministers of the Czech Republic|prime minister]], as well the other members of the cabinet on a proposal by the prime minister.

The [[List of Prime Ministers of the Czech Republic|Prime Minister]] is the head of government and wields considerable powers, including the right to set the agenda for most foreign and domestic policy, mobilize the parliamentary majority and choose government ministers.

The members of the Chamber of Deputies are elected for a four year term by [[proportional representation]], with a 5% [[election threshold]]. There are 14 voting districts, identical to the country's administrative regions. The Chamber of Deputies, the successor to the [[Czech National Council]], has the powers and responsibilities of the now defunct federal parliament of the former [[Czechoslovakia]].

The members of the Senate are elected in single-seat [[constituency|constituencies]] by two-round [[Two-round system|runoff voting]] for a six-year term, with one-third elected every even year in the autumn. The first election was in 1996, for differing terms. This arrangement is modeled on the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]], but each constituency is roughly the same size and the voting system used is a two-round runoff. The Senate is unpopular among the public and suffers from low election turnout, overall roughly 30% in the first round and 20% in the second.

=== Foreign relations ===
{{Main|Foreign relations of the Czech Republic}}
[[File:Czech ISAF (6).jpg|left|thumb|120px|Czech soldier in [[Afghanistan]]]]
Membership in the European Union is central in Czech Republic's foreign policy. The Czech Republic held the [[Presidency of the Council of the European Union]] for the first half of 2009.

=== Military ===
{{Main|Military of the Czech Republic}}
The Czech armed forces consist of the [[Military of the Czech Republic|Army]], [[Czech Air Force|Air Force]] and of specialized support units. In 2004, the Czech armed forces completely phased out [[conscription]] and transformed into a fully [[volunteer military]] army and air force. The country has been a member of [[NATO]], since 12 March 1999. Defence spending is around 1.8% of the GDP (2006).

=== Administrative divisions ===
{{See also|Regions of the Czech Republic|Districts of the Czech Republic}}
Since 2000, the Czech Republic is divided into [[List of regions of the Czech Republic|thirteen regions]] ([[Czech language|Czech]]: [[wikt:en:kraj#Czech|''kraje'', singular ''kraj'']]) and the capital city of [[Prague]]. Each region has its own elected Regional Assembly (''krajské zastupitelstvo'') and ''hejtman'' (usually translated as [[hetman]] or &quot;president&quot;). In Prague, their powers are executed by the city council and the mayor.

The older seventy-six [[districts of the Czech Republic|districts]] (''okresy'', singular ''[[okres]]'') including three &quot;statutory cities&quot; (without Prague, which had special status) lost most of their importance in 1999 in an administrative reform; they remain as territorial divisions and seats of various branches of state administration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radio.cz/en/article/36046 The death of the districts], [[Radio Prague]] 3 January 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geography ==
{{See also|Geography of the Czech Republic|Protected Areas of the Czech Republic}}
[[File:Ez-map.png|thumb|left|General map of the Czech Republic]]
The Czech Republic lies mostly between latitudes [[48th parallel north|48°]] and [[51st parallel north|51° N]] (a small area lies north of 51°), and longitudes [[12th meridian east|12°]] and [[19th meridian east|19° E]].

The Czech landscape is exceedingly varied. [[Bohemia]], to the west, consists of a basin drained by the [[Elbe]] ({{lang-cs|Labe}}) and the [[Vltava]] (or Moldau) rivers, surrounded by mostly low mountains, such as the [[Krkonoše]] range of the [[Sudetes]]. The highest point in the country, [[Sněžka]] at {{convert|1602|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, is located here. [[Moravia]], the eastern part of the country, is also quite hilly. It is drained mainly by the [[Morava River]], but it also contains the source of the [[Oder River]] ({{lang-cs|Odra}}).

Water from the landlocked Czech Republic flows to three different seas: the [[North Sea]], [[Baltic Sea]] and [[Black Sea]]. The Czech Republic also leases the [[Moldauhafen]], a {{convert|30000|m2|acre|sing=on}} [[lot (real estate)|lot]] in the middle of the [[Hamburg]] Docks, which was awarded to Czechoslovakia by Article 363 of the [[Treaty of Versailles]], to allow the landlocked country a place where goods transported down river could be transferred to seagoing ships. The territory reverts to Germany in 2028.

[[Phytogeography|Phytogeographically]], the Czech Republic belongs to the Central European province of the [[Circumboreal Region]], within the [[Boreal Kingdom]]. According to the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]], the territory of the Czech Republic can be subdivided into four [[ecoregion]]s: the Central European mixed forests, Pannonian mixed forests, [[Western European broadleaf forests]] and Carpathian montane conifer forests.

There are four [[national park]]s in the Czech Republic. The oldest is
[[Krkonoše National Park]] ([[Biosphere Reserve]]), [[Šumava National Park]] (Biosphere Reserve), National Park Podyjí, České Švýcarsko National Park.

=== Climate ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2010}}
[[File:Smrk a rameno Šance 1.jpg|thumb|left|210px|[[Šance Dam]], part of the [[Moravian-Silesian Beskids]]]]
The Czech Republic has a temperate [[continental climate]], with relatively hot summers and cold, cloudy and snowy winters. Most rain falls during the summer. The temperature difference between summer and winter is relatively high, due to the landlocked geographical position.

Within the Czech Republic, temperatures vary greatly, depending on the [[elevation]]. In general, at higher altitudes, the temperatures decrease and [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] increases. The wettest area in the Czech Republic is found around [[Bílý Potok (Liberec District)|Bílý Potok]] in [[Jizera Mountains]] and the driest region is the [[Louny District]] to the northwest of Prague. Another important factor is the distribution of the mountains; therefore, the climate is quite varied.

At the highest peak of [[Sněžka]] ({{convert|1602|m|ft|abbr=on|0|disp=/}}), the average temperature is only {{convert|-0.4|C|F|2}}, whereas in the lowlands of the [[South Moravian Region]], the average temperature is as high as {{convert|10|C|F}}. The country's capital, [[Prague]], has a similar average temperature, although this is influenced by urban factors.

[[File:Kralicky-Sneznik-03.jpg|thumb|right|230px|Rolling hills of [[Králický Sněžník]]]]
The coldest month is usually January, followed by February and December. During these months, there is usually snow in the mountains and sometimes in the major cities and lowlands. During March, April and May, the temperature usually increases rapidly, especially during April, when the temperature and weather tends to vary widely during the day. Spring is also characterized by high water levels in the rivers, due to melting snow with occasional flooding.

The warmest month of the year is July, followed by August and June. On average, summer temperatures are about 20 degrees higher than during winter. Especially in the last decade,{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} temperatures above {{convert|30|C|F}} are not unusual. Summer is also characterized by rain and storms.

Autumn generally begins in September, which is still relatively warm and dry. During October, temperatures usually fall below {{convert|15|C|F}} or {{convert|10|C|F}} and [[deciduous|deciduous trees]] begin to shed their leaves. By the end of November, temperatures usually range around the freezing point.

On 1 January 2009, former Czech PM, [[Mirek Topolánek]], declared that on 1 November 2009, the Czech government will announce a fixed date for euro adoption, since the country &quot;currently fulfils all criteria for adoption of the euro&quot;, however his subsequent deposition has rendered this deadline moot.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Czech PM: On Nov&amp;nbsp;1 Govt Will Set Euro Adoption Date|url=http://www.fxstreet.com/news/forex-news/article.aspx?StoryId=82909ae5-94b8-4124-8dcf-d9a1203ea4fb|accessdate=1 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are several challenges, however. The rate of corruption remains one of the highest among the other developed [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] countries and the public budgets remain in deficit despite strong growth of the economy in recent years. However, the 2007 deficit has been 1.58% GDP and the 2008 deficit is expected at 1.2% GDP,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Czech 2008 budget gap much lower than expected|url=http://www.forbes.com/afxnewslimited/feeds/afx/2009/01/01/afx5872811.html|accessdate=1 February 2009 | work=Forbes|date=1 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; according to [http://circa.europa.eu/irc/dsis/nfaccount/info/data/esa95/en/esa95en.htm EU accounting rules], far better than original projections.

The [[Programme for International Student Assessment]], coordinated by the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]], currently ranks the Czech education system as the 15th best in the world, higher than the OECD average.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/42/8/39700724.pdf |title=OECD.org |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=25 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Transport in the Czech Republic}}
[[File:Dobříň, City Elefant 971 022-9.jpg|thumb|left|230px|Commuter trains called [[ČD Class 471|CityElefant]] made by [[Škoda Works]] operate near larger cities]]
[[Ruzyně International Airport]] is the main international airport in the country. In 2007, it handled 12.4&amp;nbsp;million passengers, which makes it one of the busiest airports in Central Europe. In total, Czech Republic has 46 airports with paved runways, six of which provide international air services.

[[České dráhy]] (the Czech railways) is the main railway operator in the Czech Republic, with about 180&amp;nbsp;million passengers carried yearly. Its cargo division, ČD Cargo, is the fifth largest railway cargo operator in the European Union. With {{convert|9505|km|2|abbr=on|lk=out}} of tracks, the Czech Republic has one of the densest railway networks in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/index.php/Transport_infrastructure_at_regional_level#Railways |title=Transport infrastructure at regional level – Statistics explained |publisher=Epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=25 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; From that number, {{convert|2926|km|2|abbr=on|lk=out}} is electrified, {{convert|7617|km|2|abbr=on|lk=out}} are single-line tracks and {{convert|1866|km|2|abbr=on|lk=out}} are double and multiple-line tracks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://provoz.szdc.cz/portal/Show.aspx?oid=185802 |title=SZDC.cz |date= |accessdate=9 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, according to the Czech Statistical Office, 65.4% of electricity was produced in steam, combined and combustion power plants (mostly coal); 30% in [[nuclear power|nuclear plants]]; and 4.6% from renewable sources, including hydropower. Russia, via pipelines through Ukraine and to a lesser extent, Norway, via pipelines through Germany, supply the Czech Republic with liquid and natural gas.

[[File:Czech.highways.png|thumb|right|Czech motorway network]]
The Czech Republic is reducing its dependence on highly polluting low-grade [[Lignite|brown coal]] as a source of energy. [[Nuclear energy]] presently provides about 30% of the total power needs, its share is projected to increase to 40%. Natural gas is procured from [[Russia]]n [[Gazprom]], roughly three-fourths of domestic consumption and from [[Norway|Norwegian]] companies, which make up most of the remaining one-fourth. Russian gas is imported via Ukraine ([[Druzhba pipeline]]), Norwegian gas is transported through Germany. Gas consumption (approx. 100 TWh in 2003–2005) is almost two times higher than the electricity consumption. South Moravia has small [[Oil and gas deposits in the Czech Republic|oil and gas deposits]].

The road network in Czech Republic is {{convert|55653|km|2|abbr=on|lk=out}} long.&lt;ref&gt;{{cs icon}} [http://www.rsd.cz/rsd/rsd.nsf/0/80345976071FCBACC12575CF004E133E/$file/RSD2009en.pdf RSD.cz]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Communications ===
{{Main|Internet in the Czech Republic}}
The Czech Republic has the most [[Wi-Fi]] subscribers in the European Union.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ey.com/global/content.nsf/Czech_Republic_E/2007_WiFi_survey_EN 2007 WiFi survey EN&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{Dead link|date=October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.volweb.cz/horvitz/os-info/czech.html |title=Openspectrum.info – Czech Republic |publisher=Volweb.cz |date= |accessdate=25 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the beginning of 2008, there was over 800 mostly local WISPs,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Wi-Fi: Poskytovatelé bezdrátového připojení|url=http://translate.google.com/translate?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.internetprovsechny.cz%2Fwifi-poskytovatele.php&amp;hl=cs&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;sl=cs&amp;tl=en|publisher=internetprovsechny.cz|accessdate=17 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Bezdrátové připojení k internetu|url=http://translate.google.com/translate?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bezdratovepripojeni.cz&amp;hl=cs&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;sl=cs&amp;tl=en|publisher=bezdratovepripojeni.cz|accessdate=18 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; with about 350,000 subscribers in 2007. Mobile internet is very popular. Plans based on either [[General Packet Radio Service|GPRS]], [[Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution|EDGE]], [[Universal Mobile Telecommunications System|UMTS]] or [[CDMA2000]] are being offered by all three mobile phone operators ([[T-Mobile]], [[Vodafone]], [[Telefónica|Telefonica O2]]) and internet provider U:fon. Government-owned Český Telecom slowed down broadband penetration. At the beginning of 2004, [[local-loop unbundling]] began and alternative operators started to offer ADSL and also SDSL. This and later privatisation of Český Telecom helped drive down prices.

On 1 July 2006, Český Telecom was acquired by globalized company (Spain owned) Telefonica group and adopted new name [[Telefónica O2 Czech Republic]]. As of January 2006, ADSL2+ is offered in many variants, both with data limit and without with speeds up to 10 Mbit/s. Cable internet is gaining popularity with its higher download speeds beginning at 2 Mbit/s up to 100 Mbit/s. The largest ISP{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}, UPC (which acquired another CATV internet provider Karneval in 2007), provides its service in all major cities.

=== Science ===
The Czech Republic has a rich scientific tradition. Important inventions include the modern [[contact lens]], the separation of modern [[blood type]]s, and the production of the [[Semtex]] [[plastic explosive]]. Prominent scientists who lived and worked in historically Czech lands include:

* [[John Amos Comenius|Jan Amos Komenský]] (1592–1670), educator and national hero, often considered the founder of modern education for his work in [[pedagogy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;science1&quot;&gt;[http://www.czech.cz/en/economy-business-science/science/ingenious-inventions?i=1 Czech.cz – Ingenious inventions].

* [[Otto Wichterle]] (1913–1998) and [[Drahoslav Lím]] (1925–2003), Czech [[chemist]]s responsible for the invention of the modern [[contact lens]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eyetopics.com/articles/18/1/The-History-of-Contact-Lenses.html The History of Contact Lenses]. Retrieved 3 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
A number of other scientists are also connected in some way with the Czech Lands, including astronomers [[Johannes Kepler]] and [[Tycho Brahe]], the founder of the [[psychoanalytic school]] of psychiatry [[Sigmund Freud]], physicists [[Ernst Mach]], [[Albert Einstein]], engineer [[Viktor Kaplan]] and logician [[Kurt Gödel]].

=== Tourism ===
{{Main|Tourism in the Czech Republic}}
[[File:2464028806 34b50134bf o.jpg|thumb|Since the fall of [[Iron Curtain]] in 1989, [[Prague]] has become one of the most visited cities in Europe.]]
The Czech economy gets a substantial income from tourism. In 2001, the total earnings from tourism reached 118.13&amp;nbsp;billion [[Czech koruna|CZK]], making up 5.5% of [[Measures of national income and output|GNP]] and 9.3% of overall export earnings. The industry employs more than 110,000 people – over 1% of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.czechtourism.com/index.php?show=001006&amp;lang=3|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070328141615/http://www.czechtourism.com/index.php?show=001006&amp;lang=3|archivedate=28 March 2007|title=Promotion Strategy of the Czech Republic in 2004–2010|accessdate=19 December 2006|publisher=Czech Tourism}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, however, there was a slump in tourist numbers in [[Prague]], possibly due to the strong Czech koruna (crown) making the country too expensive for visitors, compared to the level of services that were available.&lt;ref name=&quot;radio&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|author=20:36 UTC |url=http://www.radio.cz/en/article/106877 |title=Prague sees significant dip in tourist numbers |publisher=Radio.cz |date=21 April 2010 |accessdate=25 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The country's reputation has also suffered with guidebooks and tourists reporting overcharging by taxi drivers and pickpocketing problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;radio&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;indy&quot;&gt;[http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/prague-mayor-goes-undercover-to-expose-the-great-taxi-ripoff-486682.html Prague mayor goes undercover to expose the great taxi rip-off], 15 January 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2005, Prague's mayor, [[Pavel Bém]], has worked to improve this reputation by cracking down on petty crime&lt;ref name=&quot;indy&quot; /&gt; and, aside from these problems, Prague is a safe city.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.myczechrepublic.com/prague/safety.html Tips on Staying Safe in Prague], myczechrepublic.com&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the Czech Republic as a whole generally has a low crime rate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1099.html#crime Czech Republic – Country Specific Information], U.S. Department of State&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several centres of tourist activity. The historic city of Prague is the primary tourist attraction, as the city is also the most common point of entry for tourists visiting other parts of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.discoverczech.com/czech-sights.php4|title=Czech sights|accessdate=19 December 2006|publisher=Discover Czech}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most other cities in the country attract significant numbers of tourists, but the spa towns, such as [[Karlovy Vary]], [[Mariánské Lázně]] and [[Františkovy Lázně]], are particularly popular holiday destinations. Other popular tourist sites are the many castles and chateaux, such as those at [[Karlštejn|Karlštejn Castle]], [[Český Krumlov]] and the [[Lednice–Valtice Cultural Landscape|Lednice–Valtice area]]. Away from the towns, areas such as [[Bohemian Paradise|Český ráj]], [[Bohemian Forest|Šumava]] and the [[Krkonoše|Krkonoše Mountains]] attract visitors seeking outdoor pursuits.

The country is also famous for its love of [[puppeteer|puppetry]] and [[marionette]]s with a number of puppet [[theatre festival|festivals]] throughout the country.

The [[Pilsener]] style beer originated in western Bohemian city of [[Plzeň]], and further south the town of [[Budweis]] lent its name to its beer, eventually known as [[Budweiser Bier Bürgerbräu]] thus [[Budweiser]]. The tourism is slowly sparkling around the Southern Moravian region too, which is producing 94% of the Czech Republics wineyard.

The Czech Republic has one of the least religious populations on Earth. Historically, the Czech people have been characterised as &quot;tolerant and even indifferent towards religion&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Felix Staar, Communist regimes in Eastern Europe, Issue 269, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; According to the 2001 census, 59% of the country is [[agnosticism|agnostic]], [[atheism|atheist]] or [[Irreligion by country|irreligious]], 26.8% is Roman Catholic and 2.5% is [[Protestantism|Protestant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.czso.cz/csu/2003edicniplan.nsf/o/4110-03--obyvatelstvo_hlasici_se_k_jednotlivym_cirkvim_a_nabozenskym_spolecnostem|title=Obyvatelstvo hlásící se k jednotlivým církvím a náboženským společnostem|language=Czech|accessdate=19 December 2006|publisher=Czech Statistical Office}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1991 to 2001, the number of people identifying with no religion increased by 19.1%, or two million people, representing the largest group increase. Adherence to Christianity decreased by over one million persons.

== Culture ==
{{Main|Culture of the Czech Republic}}

=== Music ===
[[File:PragueSpring.jpg‎|thumb|right|Festival &quot;Prague Spring&quot; at [[Obecní dům]] in Prague]]
{{Main|Music of the Czech Republic}}
Music in the Czech Republic has its roots in more than 1000 years old [[sacred music]] (first preserved references come from the end of 10th century), in [[traditional music|traditional]] folk music of [[Bohemia]], [[Moravia]] and [[Silesia]] and in long-term high-culture classical music tradition. Since early eras of artificial music, Czech musicians and composers have been often influenced by genuine folk music. Notable Czech composers include [[Adam Michna]], [[Jan Dismas Zelenka]], [[Josef Mysliveček]], [[Bedřich Smetana]], [[Leoš Janáček]], [[Antonín Dvořák]], [[Bohuslav Martinů]] and [[Petr Eben]]. The most famous music festival is &quot;Prague Spring&quot; ([[Prague Spring International Music Festival|
Pražské jaro]]), that has been annually organized since [[1946]].

=== Literature ===
{{Main|Czech literature}}

[[Czech literature]] is the literature written by [[Czechs]] or other inhabitants of the Czech state, mostly in the [[Czech language]], although other languages like [[Old Church Slavonic]], [[Latin]] or German have been also used, especially in the past. Czech authors who had written in the German language, such as [[Franz Kafka]], are usually excluded from the corpus of Czech literature, regardless of their own national self-identification.

Czech literature is divided into several main time periods: the Middle Ages; the Hussite period; the years of re-Catholicization and the baroque; the Enlightenment and Czech reawakening in the 19th century; the avantgarde of the interwar period; the years under Communism and the Prague Spring; and the literature of the post-Communist Czech Republic. Czech literature and culture played a major role on at least two occasions, when Czechs lived under oppression and political activity was suppressed. On both of these occasions, in the early 19th century and then again in the 1960s, the Czechs used their cultural and literary effort to strive for political freedom, establishing a confident, politically aware nation.

=== Theatre ===
{{Main|Theatre of the Czech Republic}}

[[Theatre of the Czech Republic]] has rich tradition with roots in the Middle Ages. In the 19th century, the theatre played an important role in the national awakening movement and later, in the 20th century it became a part of the modern European theatre art.

=== Cuisine ===
{{Main|Czech cuisine}}
[[File:VeproKnedloZelo-00.jpg|thumb|right|''Vepřo-knedlo-zelo'' (Roast pork with [[dumpling]]s and [[sauerkraut]]).]]
Czech cuisine is marked by a strong emphasis on meat dishes. Pork is quite common; beef and chicken are also popular. Goose, duck, rabbit and wild game are served. Fish is rare, with the occasional exception of fresh [[trout]] and [[carp]], which is served at Christmas.

Aside from [[Slivovitz]], [[Czech beer]] and [[Czech wine|wine]], Czechs also produce two uniquely Czech liquors, [[Fernet Stock]] and [[Becherovka]]. [[Kofola]] is a non-alcoholic domestic [[cola]] [[soft drink]] which competes with [[Coca Cola]] and [[Pepsi]] in popularity.

The national dish is Vepřo-knedlo-zelo (as pictured) or svíčková na smetaně (beef with creamy-vegetable sauce). Czech desserts aren't particularly sweet, and frequently are with poppy seeds.

=== Sports ===
{{See also|Sport in the Czech Republic|Czech Republic men's national ice hockey team|Czech Republic national football team}}
Sports play a part in the life of many [[Czechs]], who are generally loyal supporters of their favourite teams or individuals. The two leading sports in the Czech Republic are [[Association football|football]] (soccer) and [[ice hockey]], both drawing the largest attention of both the media and supporters. Tennis is also a very big sport in the Czech Republic. The many other sports with professional leagues and structures include basketball, volleyball, [[team handball]], [[track and field athletics]] and [[floorball]].

Sport is a source of strong waves of [[patriotism]], usually rising several days or weeks before an event and sinking several days after.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} The events considered the most important by Czech fans{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} are: the [[Ice Hockey World Championships]], Olympic Ice hockey tournament, [[UEFA European Football Championship]], [[FIFA World Cup]] and qualification matches for such events. In general, any international match of the Czech ice hockey or football national team draws attention, especially when played against a traditional rival:{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} Germany and [[Netherlands]] in football; [[Russia]], [[Finland]], [[Sweden]] and [[Canada]] in ice hockey; and [[Slovakia]] in both.

From 1939 to 1945, the state did not [[de facto]] exist because of its forced division and partial incorporation into [[Nazi Germany]], but the [[Czechoslovak government-in-exile]] nevertheless continued to exist during this period. In 1945, the eastern part of [[Carpathian Ruthenia]] was taken over by the [[Soviet Union]]. On 1 January 1993, Czechoslovakia [[dissolution of Czechoslovakia|peacefully split]] into the '''[[Czech Republic]] '''and '''[[Slovakia]]'''.

==Basic characteristics==
'''Form of state''':
*1918&amp;ndash;1938: A [[democratic]] republic.
*1938&amp;ndash;1939: After annexation of [[Sudetenland]] by [[Germany]] in 1938, the region gradually turned into a state with loosened connections between Czech, Slovak, and Ruthenian parts. A large strip of southern Slovakia and [[Ruthenia]] was annexed by [[Hungary]], and the [[Zaolzie]] region was annexed by [[Poland]].
*1939&amp;ndash;1945: The region split into the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]] and the [[Slovak Republic (1939-1945)|Slovak Republic]]. A [[Czechoslovak Government-in-Exile|government-in-exile]] continued to exist in London, supported by the United Kingdom, United States and its Allies; after German invasion of Russia, it was also recognised by the [[USSR]]. Czechoslovakia was part of [[Declaration by United Nations]] and was a founding member of [[United Nations]].
*1946&amp;ndash;1948: The country was governed by a coalition government with [[Communist]] ministers, with the prime minister and the minister of interior. [[Carpathian Ruthenia]] was ceded to the USSR.
*1948&amp;ndash;1989: The country became a [[communist state]] with a centrally [[planned economy]]. In 1960, the country officially became a [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|socialist republic]].
*1969&amp;ndash;1990: The [[Federation|federal]] republic consisted of the ''[[Czech Socialist Republic]]'' and the ''[[Slovak Socialist Republic]]''.
*1990&amp;ndash;1992: The [[Federation|federal]] [[democratic]] republic consisted of the ''Czech Republic'' and the ''Slovak Republic''.

'''Neighbours''': [[Germany]], 1945&amp;ndash;1990, [[West Germany|West]] and [[East Germany]]; 
[[Poland]], from 1945; 
Soviet Union (1992: [[Ukraine]]); 
[[Romania]] (until 1939); [[Hungary]]; [[Austria]].

'''Topography''': The country was of generally irregular terrain. The western area was part of north-central European uplands. The eastern region was composed of northern reaches of [[Carpathian Mountains]] and [[Danube River]] basin lands. 

'''Climate''': The weather was predominantly continental, but varied from the moderate temperature of [[Western Europe]] in the west, to more severe weather of [[Eastern Europe]] and the western Soviet Union in the east.

==History==
{{Main|History of Czechoslovakia}}

===Foundation===
====Origins====
{{Main|Origins of Czechoslovakia}}
The area was long a part of the [[Austro Hungarian Empire]] until the Empire collapsed at the end of World War I. A new state was born with Tomáš Masaryk (1850–1937) serving as the first president from 1918 to 1935. He was succeeded by his close ally, Edvard Benes (1884–1948).

The roots of Czech nationalism go back to the 19th century, when philologists and educators, influenced by [[Romanticism]], promoted the Czech language and pride in the Czech nation. Nationalism became a mass movement in the last half of the 19th century. Taking advantage of the opportunities for limited participation in political life available under the Austrian rule, Czech leaders such as historian František Palacký (1798–1878) founded many patriotic, self-help organizations which provided a chance for many of their compatriots to participate in communal life prior to independence. At first, Palacky supported Austro-Slavism and worked for reorganized, federal, and Slavic-dominated Austrian Empire, which would protect Slavs against Russian and German threats. The failure of the Revolution of 1848, however, crushed his hopes for Austro-Slavism. 

An advocate of democratic reform and Czech autonomy within Austria-Hungary, Masaryk was elected twice in 1891 and 1907 to the Austrian parliament. In 1900, he founded the Progressive (or Realist) party. With the outbreak of World War I, Masaryk began working for Czech independence in union with Slovakia. With Benes and Milan Stefanik, Masaryk visited several Western countries and won support from influential publicists.&lt;ref&gt;Z. A. B. Zeman,  ''The Masaryks:  The Making of Czechoslovakia'' (1976)&lt;/ref&gt; 

Bohemia and Moravia, under Austrian rule, were Czech-speaking industrial centers, while Slovakia, which was part of Hungary, was an undeveloped agrarian region. Conditions were much better for the development of a mass national movement in the Czech lands than in Slovakia. Nevertheless, the two regions united and created a new nation.

====Founding====
{{Main|History of Czechoslovakia (1918–1938)}}
[[File:Czechoslovakia01.png|thumb|400px|Czechoslovakia in 1928]]
Czechoslovakia was founded in October 1918, as one of the successor states of [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]] at the end of [[World War I]] and as part of the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. It consisted of the present day territories of the [[Czech Republic]], [[Slovakia]] and [[Carpathian Ruthenia]]. Its territory included some of the most industrialized regions of the former Austria-Hungary.

====Ethnicity====
The new country was a multi-ethnic state. The population consisted of Czechs (51%), Slovaks (16%), Germans (22%), Hungarians (5%) and [[Rusyns]] (4%).&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The War of the World&quot;, Niall Ferguson Allen Lane 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the Germans, Hungarians, Ruthenians and Poles&lt;ref name = &quot;pp&quot;&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20080630084718/http://www.praguepost.com/articles/2005/07/06/playing-the-blame-game.php Playing the blame game], ''[[Prague Post]]'', 6 July 2005&lt;/ref&gt; and some Slovaks, felt oppressed, however, because the political elite did not generally allow political autonomy for minority ethnic groups. This policy, combined with increasing Nazi propaganda especially in the industrialized German speaking Sudetenland, led to unrest among the non-Czech population.

The state nonetheless proclaimed the official ideology that there are no Czechs and Slovaks, but only one nation of Czechoslovaks (see [[Czechoslovakism]]), to the disagreement of Slovaks and other ethnic groups. Once a unified Czechoslovakia was restored after World War II (after the country had been divided during the war), the conflict between the [[Czechs]] and the [[Slovaks]] surfaced again.

===Interwar===
The period between the two world wars saw the flowering of democracy in Czechoslovakia. Of all the new states established in central Europe after 1918, only Czechoslovakia preserved a democratic government until the war broke out. The persistence of democracy suggests that Czechoslovakia was better prepared to maintain democracy than were other countries in the region. Thus, despite regional disparities, its level of development was much higher than that of neighboring states. The population was generally literate, and contained fewer alienated groups. The impact of these conditions was augmented by the political values of Czechoslovakia's leaders and the policies they adopted. Under [[Tomas Masaryk|Masaryk]], Czech and Slovak politicians promoted progressive social and economic conditions that served to defuse discontent.

Foreign minister Beneš became the prime architect of the Czechoslovak-Romanian-Yugoslav alliance (the &quot;[[Little Entente]]&quot;, 1921–38) directed against Hungarian attempts to reclaim lost areas. Beneš worked closely with France. Far more dangerous was the German element, which after 1933 became allied with the Nazis in Germany. The increasing feeling of inferiority among the Slovaks, who were hostile to the more numerous Czechs, weakened the country in the late 1930s. Many Slovaks supported an extreme nationalist movement and welcomed the puppet Slovak state set up under Hitler's control in 1939.

===Munich ===
{{Main|German occupation of Czechoslovakia}}
[[File:Lidice massacred men.jpg|thumb|Innocent&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lidice-memorial.cz/history_en.aspx History of Lidice]&lt;/ref&gt; civilians massacred by Nazis in village [[Lidice]], 10 June 1942, ]]
In 1938, [[Hitler]] demanded control of the [[Sudetenland]]. Britain, and France at the [[Munich Conference]] ceded the control in the [[Appeasement]], ignoring the military alliance Czechoslovakia had with France. In 1939, the remainder (&quot;rump&quot;) of Czechoslovakia was invaded by [[Nazi Germany]] and divided into the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]] and the puppet [[Slovak State]]. Much of Slovakia and all of [[Subcarpathian Ruthenia]] were annexed by Hungary. Poland occupied [[Zaolzie]], an area with Polish minority, in October 1938).

The eventual goal of German the state under Nazi leadership was to eradicate Czech nationality through assimilation, deportation, and extermination of the Czech intelligentsia; the intellectual elites and middle class made up a considerable number of the 200,000 people who passed through concentration camps and the 250,000 who died during German occupation.&lt;ref&gt;Universities in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries (1800-1945)Walter Rüegg Cambridge University Press (October 28, 2004) page 353&lt;/ref&gt; Under [[Generalplan Ost]], it was assumed that around 50% Czechs would be fit for [[Germanization]]. The Czech intellectual elites were to be removed not only from Czech territories but from [[Europe]] completely. The authors of Generalplan Ost believed it would be best if they emigrated overseas, as even in [[Siberia]] they were considered a threat to German rule. Just like Jews, Poles, Serbs, and several other nations, Czechs were considered to be [[untermenschen]] by the Nazi state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dac.neu.edu/holocaust/Hitlers_Plans.htm HITLER'S PLANS FOR EASTERN EUROPE Selections from Janusz Gumkowkski and Kazimierz Leszczynski POLAND UNDER NAZI OCCUPATION]&lt;/ref&gt;

The deportation of Jews to concentration camps was organized, and the fortress town of [[Theresienstadt concentration camp|Terezín]] was made into a ghetto way station for Jewish families. On June 4, 1942, Heydrich died after being wounded by an assassin in [[Operation Anthropoid]]. Heydrich's successor, Colonel General [[Kurt Daluege]], ordered mass arrests and executions and the destruction of the villages of [[Lidice]] and [[Ležáky]]. In 1943 the German war effort was accelerated. Under the authority of [[Karl Hermann Frank]], German minister of state for Bohemia and Moravia, some 350,000 Czech labourers were dispatched to the Reich. Within the protectorate, all non-war-related industry was prohibited. Most of the Czech population obeyed quiescently up until the final months preceding the end of the war, while thousands were involved in the [[resistance movement]].

For the Czechs of the Protectorate Bohemia and Moravia, [[Occupation of Czechoslovakia|German occupation]] was a period of brutal oppression.Czech losses resulting from political persecution and deaths in concentration camps totalled between 36,000 and 55,000. The Jewish population of Bohemia and Moravia (118,000 according to the 1930 census) was virtually annihilated. Many Jews emigrated after 1939; more than 70,000 were killed; 8,000 survived at Terezín. Several thousand Jews managed to live in freedom or in hiding throughout the occupation.

===Communist Czechoslovakia===
{{Main|History of Czechoslovakia (1948–1989)}}
[[image:Spartakiáda - 1960.JPG|thumb|200|[[Spartakiad (Czechoslovakia)|Spartakiad]] in 1960.]]
After World War II, prewar Czechoslovakia was re-established, with the exception of Subcarpathian Ruthenia, which was annexed by the [[Soviet Union]] and incorporated into the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]]. The [[Beneš decrees]] were promulgated concerning ethnic Germans (see [[Potsdam Agreement]]) and ethnic Hungarians. Under the decrees, [[citizenship]] was abrogated for people of German and Hungarian [[ethnic origin]], who had accepted German or Hungarian citizenship during the occupations. In 1948, this provision was canceled for the Hungarians, but only partially for the Germans. The government then confiscated the property of the Germans and [[Expulsion of Germans after World War II|expelled about 90% of the ethnic German population]], over 2 million people. Those who remained were [[Collective accountability|collectively accused]] of supporting the Nazis after the [[Munich Agreement]], as 97.32% of Sudeten Germans voted for the [[NSDAP]] in the December 1938 elections. Almost every decree explicitly stated that the sanctions did not apply to antifascists, although the term ''antifascist'' was not explicitly defined&lt;!-- typically it was up to decision of local municipalities --&gt;. Some 250,000 Germans, many married to Czechs, some antifascists, and also those required for the post-war reconstruction of the country, remained in Czechoslovakia. The Beneš Decrees still cause controversy among [[nationalist]] groups in the [[Czech Republic]], [[Germany]], [[Austria]] and [[Hungary]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.nyu.edu/eecr/vol11num1_2/special/rupnik.html East European Constitutional Review&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Carpathian Ruthenia]] was occupied by (and in June 1945 formally ceded to) the Soviet Union. In the 1946 parliamentary election, the [[Communist Party of Czechoslovakia]] was the winner in the [[Czech lands]], and the [[Democratic Party (Slovakia)|Democratic Party]] won in [[Slovakia]]. In February 1948 the Communists seized power. Although they would maintain the fiction of political pluralism through the existence of the [[National Front (Czechoslovakia)|National Front]], except for a short period in the late 1960s (the [[Prague Spring]]) the country was characterised by the absence of [[liberal democracy]]. While its economy remained more advanced than those of its neighbours in [[Eastern Europe]], Czechoslovakia grew increasingly economically weak relative to [[Western Europe]].

[[File:Czechoslovakia.png|thumb|400px|left|Czechoslovakia in 1969]]
In 1968, when the reformer [[Alexander Dubcek]] was appointed to the key post of First Secretary of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, there was a brief period of liberalization known as the [[Prague Spring]]. In response, after failing to persuade the Czechoslovak leaders to change course, five other [[Eastern Bloc]]  members of the Warsaw Pact invaded. Soviet tanks rolled into Czechoslovakia on the night of 20–21 August 1968.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.upi.com/Audio/Year_in_Review/Events-of-1968/N.-Korea-Seize-U.S.-Ship/12303153093431-9/#title &quot;Russia Invades Czechoslovakia: 1968 Year in Review, UPI.com&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; The General Secretary of the Soviet Communist Party [[Leonid Brezhnev]] viewed this intervention as vital to the preservation of the Soviet, socialist system and vowed to intervene in any state that sought to replace [[Marxism]]-[[Leninism]] with capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;John Lewis Gaddis, The Cold War: A New History (New York: The Penguin Press),150.&lt;/ref&gt; In the week after the invasion there was a spontaneous campaign of [[civil resistance]] against the occupation. This resistance involved a wide range of acts of non-cooperation and defiance: this was followed by a period in which the Czechoslovak Communist Party leadership, having been forced in Moscow to make concessions to the Soviet Union, gradually put the brakes on their earlier liberal policies.&lt;ref&gt;Philip WIndsor and [[Adam Roberts (scholar)|Adam Roberts]], ''Czechoslovakia 1968: Reform, Repression and Resistance'' (London: Chatto &amp; Windus, 1969), pp. 97-143.&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1969 Dubcek was finally dismissed from the First Secretaryship of the Czechoslovak Communist Party. Meanwhile, one plank of the reform programme had been carried out: in 1968-9, Czechoslovakia was turned into a [[federation]] of the [[Czech Socialist Republic]] and [[Slovak Socialist Republic]]. The theory was that under the federation, social and economic inequities between the Czech and Slovak halves of the state would be largely eliminated. A number of ministries, such as education, now became two formally equal bodies in the two formally equal republics. However, the centralised political control by the Czechoslovak Communist Party severely limited the effects of federalisation.

The 1970s saw the rise of the [[dissident]] movement in Czechoslovakia, represented (among others) by [[Václav Havel]]. The movement sought greater political participation and expression in the face of official disapproval, manifested in limitations on work activities, which went as far as a ban on professional employment, the refusal of higher education for the dissidents' children, police harassment and prison.

===After 1989===
{{Main|History of Czechoslovakia (1989–1992)}}
In 1989, the [[Velvet Revolution]] restored democracy. This occurred at around the same time as the fall of communism in [[Romania]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Hungary]] and [[Poland]]. Within three years communist rule was extirpated from [[Europe]]. 

Unlike [[Yugoslavia]] and the [[Soviet Union]], the end of communism in this country did not automatically mean the end of the &quot;communist&quot; name: the word &quot;socialist&quot; was removed from the name on 29 March 1990 and replaced by &quot;federal&quot;.

In 1992, because of growing nationalist tensions, Czechoslovakia was [[dissolution of Czechoslovakia|peacefully dissolved]] by parliament. On 1 January 1993 it formally separated into two completely independent countries: the [[Czech Republic]] and the [[Slovak Republic]].

==Administrative divisions==
{{Main|Administrative divisions of Czechoslovakia}}
*1918&amp;ndash;1923: Different systems in former Austrian territory ([[Bohemia]], [[Moravia]], a small part of [[Silesia]]) compared to former Hungarian territory ([[Slovakia]] and [[Ruthenia]]): three lands (''země'') (also called district units (''obvody'')): Bohemia, Moravia, Silesia, plus 21 counties (''župy'') in today's Slovakia and two(?) counties in today's Ruthenia; both lands and counties were divided into districts (''[[okres]]y'').
*1923&amp;ndash;1927: As above, except that the Slovak and Ruthenian counties were replaced by six (grand) counties (''(veľ)župy'') in Slovakia and one (grand) county in Ruthenia, and the numbers and boundaries of the ''okresy'' were changed in those two territories.
*1928&amp;ndash;1938: Four lands (Czech: ''země'', Slovak: ''krajiny''): Bohemia, Moravia-Silesia, Slovakia and Subcarpathian Ruthenia, divided into districts (''okresy'').
*Late 1938&amp;ndash;March 1939: As above, but Slovakia and Ruthenia gained the status of &quot;autonomous lands&quot;.
*1945&amp;ndash;1948: As in 1928&amp;ndash;1938, except that Ruthenia became part of the Soviet Union.
*1949&amp;ndash;1960: 19 regions (''kraje'') divided into 270 ''okresy''.
* 1960&amp;ndash;1992: 10 ''kraje'', [[Prague]], and (from 1970) [[Bratislava]] (capital of Slovakia); these were divided into 109&amp;ndash;114 okresy; the kraje were abolished temporarily in Slovakia in 1969&amp;ndash;1970 and for many purposes from 1991 in Czechoslovakia; in addition, the Czech Socialist Republic and the Slovak Socialist Republic were established in 1969 (without the word ''Socialist'' from 1990).

==Population and ethnic groups==
{{Main|Demographics of Czechoslovakia}}

==Politics==
{{Main|History of Czechoslovakia (1918–1938)}} {{Main|Politics of Communist Czechoslovakia}}

After WWII, a political monopoly was held by the [[Communist Party of Czechoslovakia]] (KSC). [[Gustáv Husák]] was elected first secretary of the KSC in 1969 (changed to general secretary in 1971) and president of Czechoslovakia in 1975. Other parties and organizations existed but functioned in subordinate roles to the KSC. All political parties, as well as numerous mass organizations, were grouped under umbrella of the [[National Front (Czechoslovakia)|National Front]]. Human rights activists and religious activists were severely repressed.

==Constitutional development==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Constitution of Czechoslovakia]] --&gt;
Czechoslovakia had the following [[constitution]]s during its history (1918&amp;ndash;1992):
* Temporary constitution of 14 November 1918 (democratic): see [[History of Czechoslovakia (1918–1938)]]
* The [[Czechoslovak Constitution of 1920|1920 constitution]] (The Constitutional Document of the Czechoslovak Republic), democratic, in force until 1948, several amendments
* The Communist 1948 [[Ninth-of-May Constitution]]
* The Communist [[1960 constitution of Czechoslovakia|1960 Constitution of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic]] with major amendments in 1968 ([[Constitutional Law of Federation]]), 1971, 1975, 1978, and 1989 (at which point the leading role of the Communist Party was abolished). It was amended several more times during 1990–1992 (for example, 1990, name change to [[Czecho-Slovakia]], 1991 incorporation of the human rights charter)

==Economy==
{{Main|Economy of Communist Czechoslovakia}}

After WWII, the economy was centrally planned, with command links controlled by the communist party, similarly to the [[Soviet Union]]. The large metallurgical industry was dependent on imports of iron and non-ferrous ores. 

*Industry: Extractive industry and manufacturing dominated the sector, including machinery, chemicals, food processing, metallurgy, and textiles. The sector was wasteful in its use of energy, materials, and labor and was slow to upgrade technology, but the country was a major supplier of high-quality machinery, instruments, electronics, aircraft, airplane engines and arms to other communist countries.
*Agriculture: Agriculture was a minor sector, but collectivized farms of large acreage and relatively efficient mode of production enabled the country to be relatively self-sufficient in food supply. The country depended on imports of grains (mainly for livestock feed) in years of adverse weather. Meat production was constrained by shortage of feed, but the country still recorded high per capita consumption of meat.
*Foreign trade: Exports were estimated at US$17.8 billion in 1985. Exports were machinery (55%), fuel and materials (14%), and manufactured consumer goods (16%). Imports stood at estimated US$17.9 billion in 1985, including fuel and materials (41%), machinery (33%), and agricultural and forestry products (12%). In 1986, about 80% of foreign trade was with other communist countries.
*Exchange rate: Official, or commercial, rate was crowns (Kčs) 5.4 per US$1 in 1987. Tourist, or non-commercial, rate was Kčs 10.5 per US$1. Neither rate reflected purchasing power. The exchange rate on the [[black market]] was around Kčs 30 per US$1, which became the official rate once the currency became convertible in the early 1990s.
*Fiscal year: Calendar year.
*Fiscal policy: The state was the exclusive owner of means of production in most cases. Revenue from state enterprises was the primary source of revenues followed by [[turnover tax]]. The government spent heavily on social programs, subsidies, and investment. Budget was usually balanced or left small surplus.

==Resource base==
{{Main|Resource base of Communist Czechoslovakia}}

After WWII, the country was short of energy, relying on imported crude oil and natural gas from Soviet Union, domestic brown coal, and nuclear and hydroelectric energy. Energy constraints a major factor in 1980s.

==Transportation and communications==
{{Main|Transportation in Czechoslovakia}}

==Society and social groups==

==Education==
{{Main|Education in Czechoslovakia}}
Education free at all levels and compulsory from age six to 15. Vast majority of population literate. Highly developed system of apprenticeship training and vocational schools supplemented general secondary schools and institutions of higher education.

==Religion==
{{Main|Religion in Czechoslovakia (1948-1989)}}

In 1991: [[Roman Catholics]] 46.4%, [[Lutheranism|Evangelic Lutheran]] 5.3%, [[Atheist]] 29.5%, n/a 16.7%, but there were huge differences between the two constituent republics &amp;ndash; see [[Czech Republic]] and [[Slovakia]]

==Health, social welfare and housing==
{{Main|Health and Social Welfare in Communist Czechoslovakia}}

After WWII, [[Universal Healthcare|free health care]] was available to all citizens. National health planning emphasized preventive medicine; factory and local health care centers supplemented hospitals and other inpatient institutions. There was substantial improvement in [[rural]] [[health care]] during the 1960s and 1970s.

==Mass media==
{{Main|Mass media in Communist Czechoslovakia}}

During Communist rule, the mass media in Czechoslovakia were controlled by the Communist Party. Private ownership of any publication or agency of the mass media was generally forbidden, although churches and other organizations published small periodicals and newspapers. Even with this information monopoly in the hands of organizations under KSČ control, all publications were [[Censorship|reviewed]] by the government's ''Office for Press and Information''.

==Sports==
The [[Czechoslovakia national football team]] was a consistent performer on the international scene, with 8 appearances in the [[FIFA World Cup|FIFA World Cup Finals]], finishing in second place in [[1934 FIFA World Cup|1934]] and [[1962 FIFA World Cup|1962]]. The team also won the [[UEFA European Football Championship|European Football Championship]] in [[UEFA Euro 1976|1976]], came in third in [[UEFA Euro 1980|1980]] and won the Olympic gold 1980.

The [[Czechoslovak national ice hockey team]] won many medals from the world championships and Olympic Games. [[Peter Šťastný]], [[Jaromír Jágr]], [[Peter Bondra]], [[Petr Klíma]], [[Marián Gáborík]], and [[Pavol Demitra]] all come from Czechoslovakia.

[[Emil Zátopek]], winner of four [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] gold medals in [[athletics (sport)|athletics]], is considered one of the top athletes in history.

[[Věra Čáslavská]] was an Olympic gold medallist in gymnastics, winning seven gold medals and four silver medals, and represented Czechoslovakia in three consecutive Olympics. 

The famous [[tennis]] players [[Ivan Lendl]], [[Miloslav Mečíř]], [[Daniela Hantuchová]] and [[Martina Navrátilová]] were born in Czechoslovakia.

&lt;div class=&quot;thumbcaption&quot;&gt;Computer science deals with the theoretical foundations of information and computation, and with practical techniques for their implementation and application.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
'''Computer science''' or '''computing science''' (abbreviated '''CS''') is the study of the theoretical foundations of [[information]] and [[computation]] and of practical techniques for their implementation and application in [[computer]] systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite doi|10.1145/63238.63239}} &quot;Computer science and engineering is the systematic study of algorithmic processes-their theory, analysis, design, efficiency, implementation, and application-that describe and transform information.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|author=Wegner, P.|title=Research paradigms in computer science|booktitle=Proceedings of the 2nd international Conference on Software Engineering |location=San Francisco, California, United States| date=October 13–15, 1976|publisher=IEEE Computer Society Press, Los Alamitos, CA|quote=Computer science is the study of information structures}}&lt;/ref&gt; Computer scientists invent [[algorithm]]ic processes that create, describe, and transform information and formulate suitable [[abstraction (computer science)|abstraction]]s to model complex systems.

Computer science has many [[List of computer science fields|sub-fields]]; some, such as [[computational complexity theory]], study the properties of [[computational problem]]s, while others, such as [[computer graphics]], emphasize the computation of specific results. Still others focus on the challenges in implementing computations. For example, [[programming language theory]] studies approaches to describe computations, while [[computer programming]] applies specific [[programming language]]s to solve specific computational problems, and [[human-computer interaction]] focuses on the challenges in making computers and computations useful, usable, and universally accessible to [[humans]].

The general public sometimes confuses computer science with careers that deal with computers (such as [[information technology]]), or think that it relates to their own experience of computers, which typically involves activities such as gaming, web-browsing, and word-processing. However, the focus of computer science is more on understanding the properties of the programs used to implement software such as games and web-browsers, and using that understanding to create new programs or improve existing ones.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;''Common myths and preconceptions about Cambridge Computer Science''&quot; [http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/admissions/undergraduate/myths/ Computer Science Department], [[University of Cambridge]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{Main| History of computer science}}
The early foundations of what would become computer science predate the invention of the modern [[digital computer]]. Machines for calculating fixed numerical tasks, such as the [[abacus]], have existed since antiquity. [[Wilhelm Schickard]] designed the first mechanical calculator in 1623, but did not complete its construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Nigel Tout|title=Calculator Timeline|url=http://www.vintagecalculators.com/html/calculator_time-line.html|work=Vintage Calculator Web Museum|year=2006|accessdate=2006-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Blaise Pascal]] designed and constructed the first working mechanical calculator, the [[Pascal's calculator|Pascaline]], in 1642. [[Charles Babbage]] designed a [[difference engine]] and then a general-purpose [[Analytical Engine]] in [[Victorian era|Victorian]] times&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/on-line/babbage/index.asp | title=Science Museum - Introduction to Babbage | accessdate=2006-09-24 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060908054017/http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/on-line/babbage/index.asp &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;, for which [[Ada Lovelace]] wrote a manual. Because of this work she is regarded today as the world's first [[programmer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.scottlan.edu/Lriddle/women/ada-love.htm| title=A Selection and Adaptation From Ada's Notes found in &quot;Ada, The Enchantress of Numbers,&quot; by Betty Alexandra Toole Ed.D. Strawberry Press, Mill Valley, CA | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1900, [[Unit record equipment|punched card machines]] were introduced. 

During the 1940s, as newer and more powerful computing machines were developed, the term ''computer'' came to refer to the machines rather than their human predecessors.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Association for Computing Machinery]] (ACM) was founded in 1947.&lt;/ref&gt; As it became clear that computers could be used for more than just mathematical calculations, the field of computer science broadened to study [[computation]] in general. Computer science began to be established as a distinct academic discipline in the 1950s and early 1960s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Denning_cs_discipline&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/conference/EDSAC99/statistics.html CAM.ac.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; The world's first computer science degree program, the [[Cambridge Diploma in Computer Science]], began at the [[University of Cambridge]] Computer Laboratory in 1953. The first computer science degree program in the United States was formed at [[Purdue University]] in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.purdue.edu/feature/conte.html Computer science pioneer Samuel D. Conte dies at 85] July 1, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Since practical computers became available, many applications of computing have become distinct areas of study in their own right.

Although many initially believed it was impossible that computers themselves could actually be a scientific field of study, in the late fifties it gradually became accepted among the greater academic population.&lt;ref name=&quot;Levy1984&quot;&gt;{{cite book | authorlink = Steven Levy | last = Levy | first = Steven | title = [[Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution]] | year = 1984 | isbn = 0-385-19195-2 | publisher = Doubleday }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the now well-known [[IBM]] brand that formed part of the computer science revolution during this time. IBM (short for International Business Machines) released the IBM 704 and later the IBM 709 computers, which were widely used during the exploration period of such devices. &quot;Still, working with the IBM [computer] was frustrating...if you had misplaced as much as one letter in one instruction, the program would crash, and you would have to start the whole process over again&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Levy1984&quot;/&gt; During the late 1950s, the computer science discipline was very much in its developmental stages, and such issues were commonplace.

Time has seen significant improvements in the usability and effectiveness of computer science technology. Modern society has seen a significant shift from computers being used solely by experts or professionals to a more widespread user base. Initially, computers were quite costly, and for their most-effective use, some degree of human aid was needed, in part by professional computer operators. However, as computers became widespread and far more affordable, less human assistance was needed, although residues of the original assistance still remained.

The latter includes essential design software for integrated circuits.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

== Philosophy ==
{{main|Philosophy of computer science}}
Following [[Peter Wegner]], Amnon H. Eden proposes that there are three [[paradigm]]s at work in various areas of computer science:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite doi|10.1007/s11023-007-9060-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* a &quot;rationalist paradigm&quot;, which treats computer science as branch of mathematics, which is prevalent in theoretical computer science, and mainly employs [[deductive reasoning]],
* a &quot;technocratic paradigm&quot;, readily identifiable with [[engineering]] approaches, most prominent in software engineering, and
* a &quot;scientific paradigm&quot;, which approaches computer-related artifacts from the empirical perspective of [[natural science]]s, and identifiable in some branches of artificial intelligence (the study of [[artificial life]] for instance).

== Fields of computer science ==

As a discipline, computer science spans a range of topics from theoretical studies of algorithms and the limits of computation to the practical issues of implementing computing systems in hardware and software.&lt;ref name=&quot;CSAB1997&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Computing Sciences Accreditation Board|title=Computer Science as a Profession|url=http://www.csab.org/comp_sci_profession.html  |date=28 May 1997| accessdate=2010-05-23 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080617030847/http://www.csab.org/comp_sci_profession.html |archivedate = 2008-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Committee on the Fundamentals of Computer Science: Challenges and Opportunities, National Research Council |title=Computer Science: Reflections on the Field, Reflections from the Field|url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=11106#toc|publisher=National Academies Press|isbn=978-0-309-09301-9|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[CSAB (professional organization)|CSAB]], formerly called ''Computing Sciences Accreditation Board'' – which is made up of representatives of the [[Association for Computing Machinery]] (ACM), and the [[IEEE Computer Society]] (IEEE-CS)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csab.org/ CSAB, Inc.]&lt;/ref&gt; – identifies four areas that it considers crucial to the discipline of computer science: ''theory of computation'', ''algorithms and data structures'', ''programming methodology and languages'', and ''computer elements and architecture''. In addition to these four areas, CSAB also identifies fields such as software engineering, artificial intelligence, computer networking and communication, database systems, parallel computation, distributed computation, computer-human interaction, computer graphics, operating systems, and numerical and symbolic computation as being important areas of computer science.&lt;ref name=&quot;CSAB1997&quot;/&gt;

=== Theoretical computer science ===
{{main|Theoretical computer science}}
The broader field of [[theoretical computer science]] encompasses both the classical theory of computation and a wide range of other topics that focus on the more abstract, logical, and mathematical aspects of computing.

==== Theory of computation ====
{{main|Theory of computation}}
According to [[Peter J. Denning]], the fundamental question underlying computer science is, ''&quot;What can be (efficiently) automated?&quot;''&lt;ref name=&quot;Denning_cs_discipline&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last=Denning | first=P.J. | authorlink=Peter J. Denning | year=2000 | title=Computer Science: The Discipline | url=http://www.idi.ntnu.no/emner/dif8916/denning.pdf  | journal=Encyclopedia of Computer Science|format=PDF |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060525195404/http://www.idi.ntnu.no/emner/dif8916/denning.pdf |archivedate = 2006-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study of the [[theory of computation]] is focused on answering fundamental questions about what can be computed and what amount of resources are required to perform those computations. In an effort to answer the first question, [[Computability theory (computer science)|computability theory]] examines which computational problems are solvable on various theoretical [[models of computation]]. The second question is addressed by [[computational complexity theory]], which studies the time and space costs associated with different approaches to solving a multitude of computational problem.

The famous &quot;[[P = NP problem|P=NP?]]&quot; problem, one of the [[Millennium Prize Problems]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.claymath.org/millennium/P_vs_NP/ Clay Mathematics Institute] P=NP&lt;/ref&gt; is an open problem in the theory of computation.

==== Information and coding theory ====
{{main|Information theory|Coding theory}}
{{Expand section|date=March 2011}}
Information theory is related to the quantification of information.This was developed by Claude E. Shannon to find 
fundamental limits on signal processing operations such as compressing data and on reliably storing and communicating data.
Coding theory is the study of the properties of codes and their fitness for a specific application. Codes are used for data compression, cryptography, error-correction and more recently also for network coding. Codes are studied for the purpose of designing efficient and reliable data transmission methods.

==== Programming language theory ====
{{main|Programming language theory}}
Programming language theory is a branch of computer science that deals with the design, implementation, analysis, characterization, and classification of [[programming language]]s and their individual [[Programming language#Elements|features]].  It falls within the discipline of computer science, both depending on and affecting [[mathematics]], [[software engineering]] and [[linguistics]].  It is a well-recognized branch of computer science, and an active research area, with results published in numerous [[Academic journal|journals]] dedicated to PLT, as well as in general computer science and engineering publications.

==== Formal methods ====
{{main|Formal methods}}
Formal methods are a particular kind of [[mathematically]]-based techniques for the [[formal specification|specification]], development and [[formal verification|verification]] of [[software]] and [[hardware]] systems. The use of formal methods for software and hardware design is motivated by the expectation that, as in other engineering disciplines, performing appropriate mathematical analysis can contribute to the reliability and robustness of a design. However, the high cost of using formal methods means that they are usually only used in the development of high-integrity systems, where [[safety]] or [[security]] is of utmost importance. Formal methods are best described as the application of a fairly broad variety of [[theoretical computer science]] fundamentals, in particular [[logic in computer science|logic]] calculi, [[formal language]]s, [[automata]] theory, and [[program semantics]], but also [[type systems]] and [[algebraic data types]] to problems in software and hardware specification and verification.

==== Concurrent, parallel and distributed systems ====
{{main|Concurrency (computer science)|Distributed computing}}
Concurrency is a property of systems in which several computations are executing simultaneously, and potentially interacting with each other. A number of mathematical models have been developed for general concurrent computation including [[Petri nets]], [[process calculi]] and the [[Parallel Random Access Machine]] model. A distributed system extends the idea of concurrency onto multiple computers connected through a network. Computers within the same distributed system have their own private memory, and information is often exchanged amongst themselves to achieve a common goal.

==== Databases and information retrieval ====
{{main|Database|Database management systems}}
A database is intended to organize, store, and retrieve large amounts of data easily. Digital databases are managed using database management systems to store, create, maintain, and search data, through [[database models]] and [[query languages]].

=== Applied computer science ===

Despite its name, a significant amount of computer science does not involve the study of computers themselves. Because of this, several alternative names have been proposed. Certain departments of major universities prefer the term ''computing science'', to emphasize precisely that difference. Danish scientist [[Peter Naur]] suggested the term ''datalogy'', to reflect the fact that the scientific discipline revolves around data and data treatment, while not necessarily involving computers. The first scientific institution to use the term was the Department of Datalogy at the University of Copenhagen, founded in 1969, with Peter Naur being the first professor in datalogy. The term is used mainly in the Scandinavian countries. Also, in the early days of computing, a number of terms for the practitioners of the field of computing were suggested in the ''Communications of the ACM'' – ''turingineer'', ''turologist'', ''flow-charts-man'', ''applied meta-mathematician'', and ''applied epistemologist''.&lt;ref&gt;Communications of the ACM 1(4):p.6&lt;/ref&gt; Three months later in the same journal, ''comptologist'' was suggested, followed next year by ''hypologist''.&lt;ref&gt;Communications of the ACM 2(1):p.4&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''computics'' has also been suggested.&lt;ref&gt;IEEE Computer 28(12):p.136&lt;/ref&gt; In continental Europe, names such as ''informatique'' (French), ''Informatik'' (German) or ''informatika'' ([[Slavic languages]]), derived from information and possibly mathematics or automatic, are more common than names derived from computer/computation.

Renowned computer scientist [[Edsger W. Dijkstra|Edsger Dijkstra]] once stated: &quot;Computer science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes.&quot; The design and deployment of computers and computer systems is generally considered the province of disciplines other than computer science. For example, the study of [[computer hardware]] is usually considered part of [[computer engineering]], while the study of commercial [[computer system]]s and their deployment is often called [[information technology]] or [[information systems]]. However, there has been much cross-fertilization of ideas between the various computer-related disciplines. Computer science research has also often crossed into other disciplines, such as [[philosophy]], [[cognitive science]], [[linguistics]], [[mathematics]], [[physics]], [[computational statistics|statistics]], and [[computational economics|economics]].

Computer science is considered by some to have a much closer relationship with mathematics than many scientific disciplines, with some observers saying that computing is a mathematical science.&lt;ref name=&quot;Denning_cs_discipline&quot; /&gt; Early computer science was strongly influenced by the work of mathematicians such as [[Kurt Gödel]] and [[Alan Turing]], and there continues to be a useful interchange of ideas between the two fields in areas such as [[mathematical logic]], [[category theory]], [[domain theory]], and [[algebra]].

The relationship between computer science and [[software engineering]] is a contentious issue, which is further muddied by [[Debates within software engineering|disputes]] over what the term &quot;software engineering&quot; means, and how computer science is defined. [[David Parnas]], taking a cue from the relationship between other engineering and science disciplines, has claimed that the principal focus of computer science is studying the properties of computation in general, while the principal focus of software engineering is the design of specific computations to achieve practical goals, making the two separate but complementary disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite doi|10.1023/A:1018949113292}}, p. 19: &quot;Rather than treat software engineering as a subfield of computer science, I treat it as an element of the set, Civil Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Chemical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, [...]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

The academic, political, and funding aspects of computer science tend to depend on whether a department formed with a mathematical emphasis or with an engineering emphasis. Computer science departments with a mathematics emphasis and with a numerical orientation consider alignment with [[computational science]]. Both types of departments tend to make efforts to bridge the field educationally if not across all research.

==== Artificial intelligence ====
{{main|Artificial intelligence}}
This branch of computer science aims to create synthetic systems which solve computational problems, reason and/or communicate like animals and humans do. This theoretical and applied subfield requires a very rigorous and integrated expertise in multiple subject areas such as [[applied mathematics]], [[logic]], [[semiotics]], [[electrical engineering]], [[philosophy of mind]], [[neurophysiology]], and [[social intelligence]] which can be used to advance the field of intelligence research or be applied to other subject areas which require computational understanding and modelling such as in [[finance]] or the [[physical sciences]]. This field started in full earnest when [[Alan Turing]], the pioneer of computer science and [[artificial intelligence]], proposed the [[Turing Test]] for the purpose of answering the ultimate question... &quot;Can computers think ?&quot;.

==== Computer architecture and engineering ====
{{main|Computer architecture|Computer engineering}}
Computer architecture, or digital computer organization, is the conceptual design and fundamental operational structure of a computer system. It focuses largely on the way by which the central processing unit performs internally and accesses addresses in memory. The field often involves disciplines of computer engineering and electrical engineering, selecting and interconnection hardware components to create computers that meet functional, performance, and cost goals.

==== Computer graphics and visualization ====
{{main|Computer graphics (computer science)}}
Computer graphics is the study of digital visual contents, and involves syntheses and manipulations of image data. The study is connected to many other fields in computer science, including [[computer vision]], [[image processing]], and [[computational geometry]], and are heavily applied in the fields of [[special effects]] and [[video games]].

==== Computer security and cryptography ====
{{main|Computer security|Cryptography}}
Computer security is a branch of computer technology, whose objective includes protection of information from unauthorized access, disruption, or modification while maintaining the accessibility and usability of the system for its intended users. Cryptography is the practice and study of hiding (encryption) and therefore deciphering (decryption) information. Modern cryptography is largely related to computer science, for many encryption and decryption algorithms are based on their computational complexity.

==== Computational science ====

[[Computational science]] (or [[scientific computing]]) is the field of study concerned with constructing [[scientific modelling|mathematical model]]s and [[numerical analysis|quantitative analysis]] techniques and using computers to analyse and solve [[scientific]] problems. In practical use, it is typically the application of [[computer simulation]] and other forms of [[computation]] to problems in various scientific disciplines.

== Education ==

Some universities teach computer science as a theoretical study of computation and algorithmic reasoning. These programs often feature the [[theory of computation]], [[analysis of algorithms]], [[formal methods]], [[Concurrency (computer science)|concurrency theory]], [[databases]], [[computer graphics]], and [[systems analysis]], among others. They typically also teach [[computer programming]], but treat it as a vessel for the support of other fields of computer science rather than a central focus of high-level study.

Other colleges and universities, as well as [[secondary school]]s and vocational programs that teach computer science, emphasize the practice of advanced programming rather than the theory of algorithms and computation in their computer science curricula. Such curricula tend to focus on those skills that are important to workers entering the software industry. The process aspects of computer programming are often referred to as [[software engineering]].

Yet while computer science professions increasingly drive the U.S. economy, computer science education is absent in most American K-12 curricula. A report entitled [http://www.acm.org/runningonempty/ &quot;Running on Empty: The Failure to Teach K-12 Computer Science in the Digital Age&quot;] was released in October 2010 by [http://www.acm.org/ Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)] and [http://csta.acm.org/ Computer Science Teachers Association (CSTA)], and revealed that only 14 states have adopted significant education standards for high school computer science. The report also found that only nine states count high school computer science courses as a core academic subject in their graduation requirements. In tandem with &quot;Running on Empty,&quot; a new, non-partisan advocacy coalition--[http://www.computinginthecore.org/ Computing in the Core (CinC)]--was founded to influence federal and state policy, such as the [http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h111-5929&amp;tab=summary Computer Science Education Act], which calls for grants to states to develop plans for improving computer science education and supporting computer science teachers.

{{cite web|url = http://www.cis.org.uk/resources/articles/making-your-mind-up-about-the-how-of-creation|quote=But Christians often disagree on the HOW. There are three main viewpoints held by evangelical Christians who hold to a high view of Scripture. Theistic evolutionism is an acceptance of evolution as the best current scientific description of the way that God made the world. It is the dominant viewpoint amongst Christians active in academic science or theology (see refs 1,2,3). Young Earth Creationism is a rejection of mainstream science in favour of an interpretation of the Genesis account that takes the 6 days of creation literally (see refs 4,5). Intelligent Design represents a range of views. In contrast to Theistic evolution or Young Earth Creationism, it is not concerned with Biblical interpretation (see refs 6,7,8). This is often viewed as middle ground for Christians, but is very controversial, for a mixture of theological, philosophical and scientific reasons. Most proponents of intelligent design would accept an old earth (c. 4.5 billion years), but reject the theory of evolution on two grounds: 1) that there is not enough evidence for evolution, and 2) complex biological systems are evidence for a designer. The Intelligent Design movement also use the evidence for fine tuning in cosmology that many theistic evolutionists talk about, so there is some common ground here.|title =Making your mind up about the HOW of creation|publisher = [[Christians in Science]]|author=Ruth Bancewicz|accessdate = 2007–10–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of creationism}}
The history of creationism is part of the [[history of religion]]s, though the term itself is modern. In the 1920s the term became particularly associated with Christian fundamentalist movements that insisted on a literalist interpretation of the Genesis creation narrative and likewise opposed the idea of [[human evolution]]. These groups succeeded in getting teaching of evolution banned in United States [[Public school (government funded)|public schools]], then from the mid-1960s the young Earth creationists promoted the teaching of &quot;scientific creationism&quot; using &quot;[[Flood geology]]&quot; in public school science classes as support for a purely literal reading of Genesis.&lt;ref name=encarta&gt;&quot;[http://encarta.msn.com/text_761580511___0/Creationism.html Creationism]&quot; Contributed By: Ronald L. Numbers, William Coleman: Microsoft Encarta Online Encyclopedia 2007. [http://www.webcitation.org/query?id=1257023127596318 Archived] 2009-10-31.&lt;/ref&gt; After the legal judgment of the case ''[[Daniel v. Waters]]'' (1975) ruled that teaching creationism in public schools contravened the [[Establishment Clause]] of the First Amendment, the content was stripped of overt biblical references and renamed [[creation science]]. When the court case ''[[Edwards v. Aguillard]]'' (1987) ruled that creation science similarly contravened the constitution, all references to &quot;creation&quot; in a draft school textbook were changed to refer to [[intelligent design]], which was subsequently claimed to be a new scientific theory. The ''[[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District|Kitzmiller v. Dover]]'' (2005) ruling concluded that intelligent design is not science and contravenes the constitutional restriction on teaching religion in public school science classes.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot; /&gt;

===Judaism and early and medieval Christianity===
The Genesis creation narrative appears in the [[Judaism|Jewish]] [[Torah]]. Early Jewish teachers believed that the biblical text contained layers of meaning, with the spiritual and [[allegorical interpretations of Genesis]] often being seen as more important than the literal. The first century Jewish writer [[Philo]] admired the literal narrative of passages concerning the [[Patriarch]]s, but in other passages viewed the literal interpretation as being for those unable to see an underlying deeper meaning. For example, he noted that [[Moses]] said the world was created in six days, but did not consider this as a length of time as &quot;we must think of God as doing all things simultaneously&quot; and the six days were mentioned because of a need for order and according with a [[perfect number]]. Genesis was about real events, but God through Moses described them in figurative or allegorical language. The tradition of such writers as [[Abraham ibn Ezra]] consistently rejected overly literal understandings of Genesis, and [[Maimonides]] described the story of [[Eve]] and the serpent as &quot;most absurd in its literal sense; but as an allegory it contains wonderful wisdom, and fully agrees with the real facts&quot;.&lt;ref name=rsf/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/yonge/index-2.html The Works of Philo Judaeus], translated from the Greek by [[Charles Duke Yonge]]:&lt;br&gt;[http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/yonge/book2.html Philo: Allegorical Interpretation, I]&lt;/ref&gt;

To a large extent, the early Christian [[Church Fathers]] read creation history as an allegory, and followed Philo's ideas of time beginning with an instantaneous creation, with days not meant literally. Christian orthodoxy rejected the second century [[Gnostic]] belief that Genesis was purely allegorical, but without taking a purely literal view of the texts. Thus [[Origen]] believed that the physical world is ‘literally’ a creation of God, but did not take the chronology or the days as ‘literal’. Similarly, [[Saint Basil]] in the fourth century while literal in many ways, described creation as instantaneous and timeless, being immeasurable and indivisible.&lt;ref name=rsf/&gt;

[[Augustine of Hippo]] in ''The Literal Meaning of Genesis'' was insistent that Genesis describes the creation of physical things, but also shows creation occurring simultaneously, with the days of creation being categories for didactic reasons, a logical framework which has nothing to do with time. For him, light was the illumination of angels rather than visible light, and spiritual light was just as literal as physical light. Augustine emphasized that the text was difficult to understand and should be reinterpreted as new knowledge became available. In particular, Christians should not make absurd dogmatic interpretations of scripture which contradict what people know from physical evidence.&lt;ref name=AUGUSTINE&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.asa3.org/ASA/PSCF/1988/PSCF3-88Young.html |title=The contemporary relevance of Augustine  |author=Davis A. Young |year=1988 |work=Perspectives on Science and Christian Faith |publisher= |pages= |accessdate=2008-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 13th century [[Thomas Aquinas]], like Augustine, asserted the need to hold the truth of Scripture without wavering while cautioning &quot;that since Holy Scripture can be explained in a multiplicity of senses, one should not adhere to a particular explanation, only in such measure as to be ready to abandon it if it be proved with certainty to be false; lest holy Scripture be exposed to the ridicule of unbelievers, and obstacles be placed to their believing.&quot;&lt;ref name=rsf/&gt;

===Natural theology===
{{Main|Natural theology}}
From 1517 the [[Protestant Reformation]] brought a new emphasis on lay literacy, with [[Martin Luther]] advocating the idea that creation took six literal days about [[dating creation|6000 years ago]], and claiming that &quot;Moses wrote that uneducated men might have clear accounts of creation&quot;, though a German peasant listening to a translation would have different perceptions from a [[Jew]] familiar with early Jewish language and culture, and Luther still had to refer to allegorical understandings such as the meaning of the serpent. [[John Calvin]] also rejected instantaneous creation, but criticised those who, contradicting the contemporary understanding of nature, asserted that there are &quot;waters above the heavens&quot;.&lt;ref name=rsf/&gt;

Discoveries of new lands brought knowledge of a huge diversity of life, and a new belief developed that each of these biological species had been individually created by God. In 1605 [[Francis Bacon]] emphasized that the works of God in nature teach us how to interpret the word of God in the Bible, and his [[Baconian method]] introduced the empirical approach which became central to modern science.&lt;ref name=moore&gt;{{cite web| last = Moore | first = James | authorlink = James Moore (biographer) | title = Evolution and Wonder - Understanding Charles Darwin | work = Speaking of Faith (Radio Program) | publisher = American Public Media | url =http://speakingoffaith.publicradio.org/programs/darwin/transcript.shtml | accessdate = 2007-06-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Natural theology]] developed the study of nature with the expectation of finding evidence supporting Christianity, and numerous attempts were made to reconcile new knowledge with the biblical [[Deluge myth]] and story of [[Noah's Ark]].&lt;ref name=floodgeol&gt;[http://www.bringyou.to/apologetics/p82.htm History of the Collapse of &quot;Flood Geology&quot; and a Young Earth], adapted from ''The Biblical Flood: A Case Study of the Church's Response to Extrabiblical Evidence'' (Eerdmans, 1995) by Davis A. Young. Retrieved 2007-06-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1650 the [[Archbishop]] of [[Armagh]], [[James Ussher]], published the [[Ussher chronology]] based on Bible history giving a date for Creation of 4004 BC. This was generally accepted, but the development of modern [[geology]] in the 18th and 19th centuries found [[geological strata]] and [[fossilization|fossil]] sequences indicating an ancient Earth. [[Catastrophism]] was favoured in England as supporting the Biblical flood, but this was found to be untenable&lt;ref name=floodgeol/&gt; and by 1850 all geologists and most Evangelical Christians had adopted various forms of [[old Earth creationism]], while continuing to firmly reject [[evolution]].&lt;ref name=rsf/&gt;{{failed verification|date=December 2010}}

===Growing evidence for evolution===
{{Main|History of evolutionary thought}}
{{See also|History of science}}
From around the start of the 19th century, ideas such as [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck|Jean-Baptiste Lamarck's]] concept of [[transmutation of species]] had gained a small number of supporters in Paris and [[Edinburgh]], mostly amongst anatomists.&lt;ref name=rsf/&gt; Britain at that time was enmeshed in the [[Napoleonic Wars]], and fears of republican revolutions such as the [[American Revolution]] and [[French Revolution]] led to a harsh repression of such evolutionary ideas, which challenged the divine hierarchy justifying the monarchy.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} [[Charles Darwin|Charles Darwin's]] [[inception of Darwin's theory|development of his theory]] of [[natural selection]] at this time was kept closely secret.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} Repression eased and the anonymous publication of ''[[Vestiges of Creation]]'' in 1844 aroused wide public interest with support from [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]] and [[Unitarianism|Unitarians]], but was strongly criticised by the [[scientific community]], which emphasized the need for solidly backed science.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} In 1859 Darwin's ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' provided that evidence from an authoritative and respected source, and gradually convinced scientists that [[evolution]] occurs.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} This acceptance was resisted by conservative evangelicals in the [[Church of England]], but their attention quickly turned to the much greater uproar about ''[[Essays and Reviews]]'' by [[Liberal Christianity|liberal Anglican theologians]], which introduced into the controversy &quot;[[the higher criticism]]&quot; begun by [[Desiderius Erasmus|Erasmus]] centuries earlier. This book re-examined the Bible and cast doubt on a literal interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Desmond | first = Adrian | last2 = Moore | first2 = James | author2-link = James Moore (biographer) | year = 1991 | title = Darwin | place = London | publisher =Michael Joseph, Penguin Group | isbn = 0-7181-3430-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1875 most American [[natural history|naturalists]] supported ideas of [[theistic evolution]], often involving [[special creation]] of human beings.&lt;ref name=encarta/&gt;

At this time those holding that [[species]] had been separately created were generally called &quot;advocates of creation&quot;, but they were occasionally called &quot;creationists&quot; in private correspondence between [[Charles Darwin]] and his friends.&lt;ref name=num /&gt; The term appears in letters Darwin wrote between 1856 and 1863,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/entry-1919 |title=Letter 1919 — Darwin, C.

===Theistic evolution===
{{Main|Theistic evolution}}
Through the 19th century the term ''creationism'' most commonly referred to [[Creationism (soul)|direct creation of individual souls]], in contrast to [[traducianism]]. Following the publication of ''[[Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation|Vestiges]]'' there was interest in ideas of Creation by divine law. In particular, the [[liberal Christianity|liberal theologian]] [[Baden Powell (mathematician)|Baden Powell]] argued that this illustrated the Creator's power better than the idea of miraculous creation, which he thought ridiculous.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bowler|2003|p=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; When ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' was published, the cleric [[Charles Kingsley]] wrote of evolution as &quot;just as noble a conception of Deity&quot;.&lt;ref name=Darwinanddesign&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/content/view/110/104/ |title=Darwin and design: historical essay |year=2007 |publisher=Darwin Correspondence Project |accessdate=2008-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-2534.html|title=Darwin Correspondence Project - Letter 2534 — Kingsley, Charles to Darwin, C.

Eventually it was realised that supernatural intervention could not be a scientific explanation, and naturalistic mechanisms such as [[neo-Lamarckism]] were favoured as being more compatible with purpose than natural selection.&lt;ref name=bowl202&gt;{{harvnb|Bowler|2003|pp=202–208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some theists took the general view that, instead of faith being in opposition to biological evolution, some or all classical religious teachings about [[Christian God]] and [[creation myth|creation]] are compatible with some or all of modern [[scientific theory]], including specifically [[evolution]]; it is also known as &quot;evolutionary creation&quot;. In Evolution versus Creationism, [[Eugenie Scott]] and Niles Eldredge state that it is in fact a type of evolution.&lt;ref&gt;''Evolution Vs. Creationism'', [[Eugenie Scott]], Niles Eldredge, p62-63&lt;/ref&gt;

It generally views evolution as a tool used by God, who is both the [[first cause]] and [[Immanence|immanent]] sustainer/upholder of the universe; it is therefore well accepted by people of strong [[theism|theistic]] (as opposed to [[deism|deistic]]) convictions. Theistic evolution can synthesize with the [[day-age creationism|day-age]] interpretation of the [[Genesis creation narrative]]; however most adherents consider that the first chapters of Genesis should not be interpreted as a &quot;literal&quot; description, but rather as a [[framework view|literary framework]] or [[allegory]].

From a theistic viewpoint, the underlying laws of nature were designed by God for a purpose, and are so self-sufficient that the complexity of the entire physical universe evolved from fundamental particles in processes such as [[stellar evolution]], life forms developed in biological evolution, and in the same way the [[Abiogenesis|origin of life by natural causes]] has resulted from these laws.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Origin of Life&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/abioprob/originoflife.html#intro |title=The Origin of Life |author=Albrecht Moritz |date=October 31, 2006 |publisher=[[TalkOrigins Archive]] |accessdate=2008-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one form or another, theistic evolution is the view of creation taught at the majority of mainline [[Protestantism|Protestant]] seminaries&lt;ref&gt;[http://ncse.com/evolution/education/science-religion-evolution Science, Religion, and Evolution] by [[Eugenie Scott]] (accessed at 2007-07-09).&lt;/ref&gt; For Catholics, [[human evolution]] is not a matter of religious teaching, and must stand or fall on its own scientific merits. [[Evolution and the Roman Catholic Church]] are not in conflict. The [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] comments positively on the theory of evolution, which is neither precluded nor required by the sources of faith, stating that scientific studies &quot;have splendidly enriched our knowledge of the age and dimensions of the cosmos, the development of life-forms and the appearance of man.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Akin| first = Jimmy| title=Evolution and the Magisterium| newspaper =This Rock| date=January 2004| url =http://www.catholic.com/thisrock/2004/0401bt.asp| accessdate =2007-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roman Catholic schools teach evolution without controversy on the basis that scientific knowledge does not extend beyond the physical, and scientific truth and religious truth cannot be in conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1141/is_21_41/ai_n13592804/print |title=National Catholic Reporter: Catholic schools steer clear of anti-evolution bias |accessdate=2007-08-15 |author=Jeff Severns Guntzel | work=National Catholic Reporter | year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theistic evolution can be described as &quot;creationism&quot; in holding that divine intervention brought about the origin of life or that divine Laws govern formation of species, though many creationists (in the strict sense) would deny that the position is creationism at all. In the [[creation-evolution controversy]] its proponents generally take the &quot;evolutionist&quot; side. This sentiment was expressed by Fr. [[George Coyne]], (Vatican's chief astronomer between 1978 and 2006):&lt;blockquote&gt;...in America, creationism has come to mean some fundamentalistic, literal, scientific interpretation of Genesis. Judaic-Christian faith is radically creationist, but in a totally different sense.

While supporting the [[naturalism (philosophy)|methodological naturalism]] inherent in modern science, the proponents of theistic evolution reject the implication taken by some [[atheism|atheists]] that this gives credence to [[Ontology|ontological]] [[materialism]].

===Views in the United States===
{{See also|Intelligent Design|Creation science}}
In the [[United States of America|United States]] some religious communities have refused to accept, as [[theistic evolution]]ists have accepted, naturalistic explanations and tried instead to counter them. The term started to become associated with [[fundamentalist Christianity|Christian fundamentalist]] opposition to [[human evolution]] and belief in a [[Young Earth creationism|young Earth]] in 1929.&lt;ref name=num&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.counterbalance.net/history/anticreat-frame.html |title=Antievolutionists and Creationists |accessdate=2007-08-15 |author=Ronald L.

Numbers |work=Creationism History |publisher=Counterbalance Meta-Library }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several U.S. states passed laws against the teaching of evolution in [[Public school (government funded)|public schools]], as upheld in the [[Scopes Trial]]. Evolution was omitted entirely from school textbooks in much of the United States until the 1960s. Since then, renewed [[Creation and evolution in public education|efforts to introduce teaching creationism in American public schools]] in the form of [[flood geology]], [[creation science]], and [[intelligent design]] have been consistently held to contravene the [[U.S. Constitution|constitutional]] [[separation of Church and State]] by a succession of legal judgments.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;&gt;[http://www.talkreason.org/articles/HistoryID.cfm Creationism/ID, A Short Legal History] By Lenny Flank, Talk Reason&lt;/ref&gt; The meaning of the term creationism was contested, but by the 1980s it had been co-opted by proponents of creation science and flood geology.&lt;ref name=num/&gt;

Such beliefs include [[Young Earth creationism]], proponents of which believe that the Earth is thousands rather than billions of years old, and typically believe that the days in chapter one of Genesis are 24 hours in length. While [[Old Earth creationism]] accepts [[geology|geological findings]] and other methods of dating the earth and believes that these findings do not contradict Genesis, but reject evolution. The term ''[[theistic evolution]]'' has been coined to refer to beliefs in creationism which are more compatible with the scientific view of evolution and the age of the Earth. Alternatively, there are other religious people who support creationism, but in terms of allegorical interpretations of Genesis.

By the start of the twentieth century, evolution was widely accepted and was beginning to be taught in U.S. [[Public school (government funded)|public schools]]. After [[World War I]], popular belief that German aggression resulted from a Darwinian doctrine of &quot;[[survival of the fittest]]&quot; inspired [[William Jennings Bryan]] to campaign against the teaching of Darwinian ideas of [[human evolution]].&lt;ref name=encarta/&gt; In the 1920s, the [[Fundamentalist-Modernist Controversy]] led to an upsurge of [[Fundamentalist Christianity|fundamentalist]] religious fervor in which schools were prevented from teaching evolution through state laws such as Tennessee’s 1925 [[Butler Act]],&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District/2:Context#Page 19 of 139]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{PDFlink|[http://www.centerforinquiry.net/uploads/attachments/Forrest_Paper.pdf Understanding the Intelligent Design Creationist Movement: Its True Nature and Goals.]|413&amp;nbsp;KB}} A Position Paper from the Center for Inquiry, Office of Public Policy Barbara Forrest.

In 1961 in the United States, an attempt to repeal the Butler Act failed.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot; /&gt; ''[[The Genesis Flood]]'' by the Baptist engineer [[Henry M. Morris]] brought the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventist]] [[Bible|biblically]] literal [[flood geology]] of [[George McCready Price]] to a wider audience, popularizing a novel idea of [[Young Earth creationism]],&lt;ref name=rsf/&gt; and by 1965 the term &quot;scientific creationism&quot; had gained currency.&lt;ref name=mclean&gt;[http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/mclean-v-arkansas.html McLean v. Arkansas Board of Education], Decision January 5, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1968 ''[[Epperson v. Arkansas]]'' judgment ruled that state laws prohibiting the teaching of evolution violate the [[Establishment Clause of the First Amendment]] of the [[U.S. Constitution]] which prohibits state aid to religion.&lt;ref name=eva&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/edwards-v-aguillard.html |title=Edwards v. Aguillard |publisher=Talkorigins.org |date= |accessdate=2011-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and when in 1975 ''[[Daniel v. Waters]]'' ruled that a state law requiring biology textbooks discussing &quot;origins or creation of man and his world&quot; to give equal treatment to creation as per ''[[Book of Genesis]]'' was unconstitutional, a new group identifying themselves as creationists promoted a &quot;[[Creation science]]&quot; which omitted explicit biblical references.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot; /&gt;

In 1981 the state of Arkansas passed a law, Act 590, mandating that &quot;creation science&quot; be given equal time in public schools with evolution, and defining creation science as positing the “creation of the universe, energy, and life from nothing,” as well as explaining the earth’s geology by &quot;the occurrence of a worldwide flood&quot;.&lt;ref name=mclean/&gt; This was ruled unconstitutional at ''[[McLean v. Arkansas]]'' in January 1982 as the creationists' methods were not scientific but took the literal wording of the Book of Genesis and attempted to find scientific support for it.&lt;ref name=mclean/&gt; Undaunted, Louisiana introduced similar legislation that year. A series of judgments and appeals led to the 1987 Supreme Court ruling in ''[[Edwards v. Aguillard]]'' that it too violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt;

&quot;Creation science&quot; could no longer be taught in public schools, and in drafts of the creation science school textbook ''[[Of Pandas and People]]'' all references to creation or creationism were changed to refer to [[intelligent design]].&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt; Proponents of the [[intelligent design movement]] organised widespread campaigning to considerable effect.

Retrieved 2007-07-01&lt;/ref&gt; but in ''[[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District|Kitzmiller v.

However, the percentage of people in the USA who accept the idea of evolution declined from 45% in 1985, to 40% in 2005.&lt;ref name=&quot;Science survey&quot;/&gt; A [[Gallup]] poll reported that percentage of people in the US that believe in a strict interpretation of creationism had fallen to 40% in 2010 after a high of 46% in 2006. The highest the percentage has risen between 1982 and 2010 was 47% in 1994 and 2000 according to the report. The report found that Americans who are less educated are more likely to hold a creationist view while those with a college education are more likely to hold a view involving evolution. 47% of those with no more than a high school education believe in creationism while 22% of those with a post graduate education hold that view. The poll also found that church attendance dramatically increased adherence to a strict creationist view (22% for those who do not attend church, 60% for those who attend weekly).&lt;ref name=gallup&gt;{{cite news|title=Four in 10 Americans Believe in Strict Creationism|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/145286/Four-Americans-Believe-Strict-Creationism.aspx|newspaper=Gallup|date=December 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The higher percentage of Republicans who identified with a creationist view is described as evidence of the strong relationship between religion and politics the United States. Republicans also attend church weekly more than Democratic or independent voters. Non-Republican voters are twice as likely to hold a strictly scientific view of evolution than Republican voters.&lt;ref name=gallup /&gt;

==Movements==
Creationist movements exist among peoples with various religious perspectives such as [[Judaism]], [[Hinduism]], [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]].

===Bahá'í Faith===
{{Main|Bahá'í Faith and science}}
The [[Bahá'í Faith]] holds the harmony of religion and science as a fundamental principle. Bahá'ís regards the biblical account of creation as symbolic, albeit important and full of symbolic meaning.&lt;ref name=&quot;matthews&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| last =  Matthews  | first = Gary L.  | title = The Challenge of Baha'u'llah  | publisher = US Baha'i Publishing Trust  | year = 2005  | pages = 90–5  | url = http://books.google.com/?id=EGbZMLCmE1IC&amp;lpg=PA90&amp;pg=PA90#v=onepage&amp;q  | isbn = 9781931847162 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Far from accepting the idea of a [[Young Earth creationism|Young Earth]], Bahá'í theology regards the Earth as ancient.&lt;ref name=&quot;brown-evo&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| editor-last = Brown | editor-first = Keven | editor2-last = Von Kitzing | editor2-first =Eberhard| last =  | first = |last2 =  | first2 =  | author2-link = | title = Evolution and Bahá'í belief: ʻAbduʾl-Bahá's response to nineteenth-century Darwinism; Volume 12 of Studies in the Bábí and Bahá'í religions |publisher = Kalimat Press | year = 2001 | location = | pages = 6, 17, 117, etc. | url = http://books.google.com/?id=egDAfpkONRsC | isbn = 9781890688080}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Humanity, Bahá'ís hold, has changed in physical form over time. Bahá'í theology holds that humanity is a species essence - an essential reality and part of God's eternal creation; as a biological species, however, humanity has gone through numerous physical changes and adaptations in time.&lt;ref name=&quot;brown-evo&quot;/&gt; The Bahá'í faith regards evolution (as a progress of physical form) and the act of divine creation as related processes or even as the same process viewed in different contexts. However, Bahá'í literature maintains that humanity is distinct from other parts of creation on Earth - that only mankind has a soul, and is capable of abstract thought and of spiritual development.&lt;ref name=&quot;brown-evo&quot;/&gt;

===Judaism and Christianity===
{{Main|Jewish views on evolution}}
{{As of | 2006}} most Christians around the world accepted evolution as the most likely explanation for the origins of species, and did not take a literal view of the [[Genesis creation narrative]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Science survey&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Miller JD, Scott EC, Okamoto S |title=Science communication.

But in the United States belief in religious fundamentalism was much more likely to affect attitudes{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} towards evolution than for believers elsewhere. Political partisanship affecting religious belief may be a factor because whilst political partisanship in the U.S. is highly correlated with fundamentalist thinking - this is not so in Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;Science survey&quot;/&gt;

According to the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], [[Rowan Williams]], &quot;...for most of the history of Christianity (and I think this is fair enough) an awareness that a belief that everything depends on the creative act of God, is quite compatible with a degree of uncertainty or latitude about how precisely that unfolds in creative time.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archbishopofcanterbury.org/354 |title='&amp;#39;'Archbishop of Canterbury'&amp;#39;', Transcript of interview with the Guardian |publisher=Archbishopofcanterbury.org |date=2006-03-21 |accessdate=2011-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
churches have made statements in favor of evolutionary theory, as have scholars such as the physicist [[John Polkinghorne]], who argues that evolution is one of the principles through which God created living beings. Earlier supporters of evolutionary theory include [[Frederick Temple]], Asa Gray and [[Charles Kingsley]] who were enthusiastic supporters of Darwin's theories upon their publication,&lt;ref&gt;see eg [[John Polkinghorne]]'s ''Science and Theology'' pp6-7&lt;/ref&gt; and the French Jesuit priest and [[geology|geologist]] [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]] saw evolution as confirmation of his Christian beliefs, despite condemnation from Church authorities for his more speculative theories. Another example is that of [[Liberal Christianity|Liberal theology]], not providing any creation models, but instead focusing on the [[symbol]]ism in beliefs of the time of authoring Genesis, the cultural environment, and comparison to non-Jewish &quot;cosmologies&quot; of that age.{{Clarify|date=February 2009}} In fact, both Jews and Christians had been considering the idea of the creation history as an allegory (instead of a historical description) long before the development of Darwin's theory of evolution. Two notable examples are the first century Jewish neoplatonic philosopher Philo of Alexandria and Saint Augustine of the late fourth century who was also a former neoplatonist. Philo wrote that it would be a mistake to think that creation happened in six days, or in any set amount of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/yonge/book2.html |title='&amp;#39;The Works of Philo Judaeus'&amp;#39;, Chapter 2, translated by Charles Duke Yonge |publisher=Earlychristianwritings.com |date=2006-02-02 |accessdate=2011-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Augustine argued that everything in the universe was created by God at the same moment in time (and not in six days as a literal reading of Genesis would seem to require);&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asa3.org/ASA/topics/Bible-Science/PSCF3-88Young.html ASA3.org], Davis A. Young, &quot;The Contemporary Relevance of Augustine's View of Creation&quot; (From: Perspectives on Science and Christian Faith 40.1:42-45 (3/1988)), The American Scientific Affiliation&lt;/ref&gt; It appears that both Philo and Augustine felt uncomfortable with the idea of a seven day creation because it detracted from the notion of God's omnipotence.

However, in the United States, an inversion has happened. Few Jews today (17%) are likely to accept the [[Biblical literalism|Biblical literal]] interpretation of the creation and favor an alternative explanation. However evangelical Christians have continued to believe the literal claims of Genesis. Members of Protestant (70%), Mormon (76%) and [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] (90%) denominations are those most likely to reject the evolutionary interpretation of the origins of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://religions.pewforum.org/pdf/report2religious-landscape-study-chapter-2.pdf |title=Pugh Forum findings Page 95 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The historic Christian literal interpretation of creation requires the harmonization of the two creation stories, Genesis 1:1-2:3 and Genesis 2:4-25, for there to be a consistent interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apologeticspress.org/articles/2194 |title= Are There Two Creation Accounts in Genesis? |author=Wayne Jackson |accessdate=2007-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/paulntobin/creationint.html |title=The Creation Myths: Internal Difficulties |accessdate=2007-05-23|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080715071138/http://www.geocities.com/paulntobin/creationint.html|archivedate=2008-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; They sometimes seek to ensure that their belief is taught in [[science]] classes, mainly in American schools (see [[Young Earth Creationism]], for example). Opponents reject the claim that the literalistic Biblical view meets the criteria required to be considered scientific.

Many religious sects teach that God created the Cosmos. From the days of the early [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Church Fathers]] there were allegorical interpretations of Genesis as well as literal aspects.&lt;ref name=rsf&gt;{{Cite book| last= Forster| first= Roger| last2= Marston| first2=Dr Paul| year=2001| title=Reason Science and Faith| place=Chester, England| publisher=Monarch Books| contribution=Chapter 7 - Genesis Through History| isbn =1854244418| url=http://www.ivycottage.org/group/group.aspx?id=6826| accessdate =2007-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Types of Biblical creationism====
Several attempts have been made to categorize the different types of creationism, and create a &quot;[[taxonomy]]&quot; of creationists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ncse.com/creationism/general/creationevolution-continuum ''The Creation/Evolution Continuum''], [[Eugenie Scott]],

Creationism covers a spectrum of beliefs which have been categorized into the broad types listed below. As a matter of popular belief and characterizations by the media, most people labeled &quot;creationists&quot; are those who object to specific parts of science for religious reasons; however many (if not most) people who believe in a divine act of creation do not categorically reject those parts of science.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

=====Young Earth creationism=====
{{Main|Young Earth creationism}}
Young Earth creationism is the belief that the Earth was created by [[God]] within the last ten thousand years, literally as described in [[Genesis creation narrative]], within the approximate time frame of biblical genealogies (detailed for example in the [[Ussher chronology]]). Most Young Earth creationists believe that the [[Universe]] has a similar age as the Earth. A few assign a much older age to the [[Universe]] than to Earth. [[Creationist cosmologies]] are attempts by some creationist thinkers to give the universe an age consistent with the Ussher chronology and other Young-Earth time frames. Other Young-Earth creationists believe that the Earth and the universe were created with the appearance of age, so that the world appears to be much older than it is, and that this appearance is what gives the geological findings and other methods of dating the earth and the universe their much longer [[timeline]]s.

The Christian organizations [[Institute for Creation Research]] (ICR) and the [[Creation Research Society]] (CRS) both promote Young Earth Creationism in the USA. Another organization with similar views, [[Answers in Genesis]] (AIG) Ministries based in both the US and United Kingdom, has opened a [[Answers in Genesis#Creation Museum|Creation Museum]] to promote Young Earth Creationism. [[Creation Ministries International]] promotes Young Earth views in Australia, Canada, South Africa, New Zealand, the United States, and the United Kingdom. Among Catholics, the [[List of Catholic creationist organisations|Kolbe Center]] for the Study of Creation promotes similar ideas.

=====Modern geocentrism=====
{{Main|Modern geocentrism}}
Modern geocentrism holds that God recently created a spherical world, and placed it in the center of the universe. The [[Sun]], [[planets]] and everything else in the universe revolve around it.

=====Omphalos hypothesis=====
{{Main|Omphalos hypothesis}}
The Omphalos hypothesis argues that in order for the world to be functional, God must have created a mature [[Earth]] with mountains and canyons, rock strata, trees with growth rings, and so on; therefore ''no'' evidence that we can see of the presumed age of the earth and [[age of the universe|universe]] can be taken as reliable.&lt;ref&gt;Gosse, Henry Philip, 1857. Omphalos: An Attempt to Untie the Geological Knot. J. Van Voorst, London
&lt;/ref&gt; The idea has seen some revival in the twentieth century by some modern creationists, who have extended the argument to light that appears to originate in far-off [[star]]s and [[galaxy|galaxies]] (see [[Starlight problem]]).

=====Creation science=====
{{Main|Creation science}}
Creation science is the attempt to present scientific evidence interpreted with Genesis axioms that supports the claims of creationism. Various claims of creation scientists include such ideas as [[creationist cosmologies]] which accommodate a universe on the order of thousands of years old, attacks on the science of [[radiometric dating]] through a technical argument about [[radiohalo]]s, explanations for the [[fossil record]] as a record of the destruction of the [[global flood]] recorded in [[Book of Genesis]] (see [[flood geology]]), and explanations for the present [[biodiversity|diversity]] as a result of pre-designed genetic variability and partially due to the rapid degradation of the perfect [[genome]]s God placed in &quot;[[created kinds]]&quot; or &quot;Baramin&quot; (see [[creation biology]]) due to [[mutations]].

=====Old Earth creationism=====
{{Main|Old Earth creationism}}
Old Earth creationism holds that the [[universe|physical universe]] was created by God, but that the creation event of Genesis is not to be taken strictly literally. This group generally believes that the [[age of the Universe]] and the age of the Earth are as described by [[astronomers]] and [[geologists]], but that details of [[evolution|modern evolutionary theory]] are questionable.

Old-Earth creationism itself comes in at least three types:

=====Gap creationism=====
{{Main|Gap creationism}}
Gap creationism, also called &quot;Restitution creationism&quot;, holds that life was recently created on a pre-existing old Earth. This theory relies on a particular interpretation of {{bibleverse||Genesis|1:1-2}}. It is considered that the words ''formless'' and ''void'' in fact denote waste and ruin, taking into account the original Hebrew and other places these words are used in the [[Old Testament]]. Genesis 1:1-2 is consequently translated:

: &quot;In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.&quot; (Original act of creation.)
: &quot;And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.&quot;

Thus, the six days of creation (verse 3 onwards) start sometime after the Earth was &quot;without form and void.&quot; This allows an indefinite &quot;gap&quot; of time to be inserted after the original creation of the universe, but prior to creation according to the [[Genesis creation narrative]](when present biological species and humanity were created). Gap theorists can therefore agree with the scientific consensus regarding the age of the Earth and universe, while maintaining a literal interpretation of the biblical text.

Some gap theorists expand the basic theory by proposing a &quot;primordial creation&quot; of biological life within the &quot;gap&quot; of time. This is thought to be &quot;the world that then was&quot; mentioned in [[2 Peter]] 3:3-7.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = The Holy Bible, King James Version  | url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=68&amp;chapter=3&amp;version=9 | accessdate = 2006-12-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Discoveries of [[fossil]]s and archaeological ruins older than 10,000 years are generally ascribed to this &quot;world that then was&quot;, which may also be associated with [[Lucifer]]'s rebellion. These views became popular with publications of Hebrew Lexicons such as the [[Strong's Concordance]], and Bible commentaries such as the ''[[Scofield Reference Bible]]'' and the [[E. W. Bullinger|Companion Bible]].

=====Day-Age creationism=====
{{Main|Day-Age creationism}}
Day-Age creationism states that the &quot;six days&quot; of [[Book of Genesis]] are not ordinary 24-hour days, but rather much longer periods (for instance, each &quot;day&quot; could be the equivalent of millions, or billions of years of human time). This theory often states that the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word &quot;yôm&quot;, in the context of Genesis 1, can be properly interpreted as &quot;age.&quot; Some adherents claim we are still living in the seventh age (&quot;seventh day&quot;).

Strictly speaking, Day-Age creationism is not so much a creationist theory as a [[hermeneutic]] option which may be combined with theories such as progressive creationism.

=====Progressive creationism=====
{{Main|Progressive creationism}}
Progressive creationism holds that species have changed or evolved in a process continuously guided by God, with various ideas as to how the process operated—though it is generally taken that God directly intervened in the natural order at key moments in Earth/life's history. This view accepts most of modern physical science including the [[age of the earth]], but rejects much of modern [[evolutionary biology]] or looks to it for evidence that [[evolution]] by [[natural selection]] alone is incorrect.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} Organizations such as [[Reasons to Believe]], founded by [[Hugh Ross (creationist)|Hugh Ross]], promote this theory.

Progressive creationism can be held in conjunction with [[hermeneutic]] approaches to [[book of Genesis|Genesis]] chapter 1 such as the [[Day-age creationism|day-age theory]] or [[Framework view|framework]]/metaphoric/poetic views.

=====Neo-Creationism=====
{{Main|Neo-Creationism}}
Neo-Creationists intentionally distance themselves from other forms of creationism, preferring to be known as wholly separate from creationism as a philosophy. Its goal is to restate creationism in terms more likely to be well received by the public, education policy makers and the [[scientific community]]. It aims to re-frame the debate over the [[Creation myth|origins of life]] in non-religious terms and without appeals to scripture, and to bring the debate before the public.

One of its principal claims is that ostensibly [[Objectivity (science)|objective]] orthodox science is actually a dogmatically [[atheism|atheistic]] [[religion]]. Neo-Creationists argue that the [[scientific method]] excludes certain explanations of phenomena, particularly where they point towards supernatural elements. They argue that this effectively excludes any possible religious insight from contributing to a scientific understanding of the [[universe]]. Neo-Creationists also argue that science, as an &quot;atheistic enterprise,&quot; is at the root of many of contemporary society's ills including social unrest and family breakdown.

The [[Intelligent Design movement]] arguably represents the most recognized form of Neo-Creationism in the United States. Unlike their philosophical forebears, Neo-Creationists largely do not believe in many of the traditional cornerstones of creationism such as a [[Young Earth creationism|young Earth]], or in a dogmatically [[Biblical inerrancy|literal interpretation of the Bible]]. Common to all forms of Neo-Creationism is a rejection of [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]]{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}, usually made together with a tacit admission of [[supernaturalism]], and an open and often hostile opposition to what they term &quot;[[Darwinism]]&quot;, which generally is meant to refer to [[evolution]].

=====Intelligent design=====
{{Main|Intelligent design}}

Intelligent design (ID) is the claim that &quot;certain features of the universe and of living things are best explained by an intelligent cause, not an undirected process such as [[natural selection]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=DIposition&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discovery.org/csc/topQuestions.php#questionsAboutIntelligentDesign|title=Top Questions-1.What is the theory of intelligent design?|publisher=[[Discovery Institute]]|accessdate=2007-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of its leading proponents are associated with the [[Discovery Institute]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/dover/day6pm.html Kitzmiller v.

Pennock, p. 645-667 of ''Intelligent Design Creationism and Its Critics: Philosophical, Theological, and Scientific Perspectives'', Robert T.

ID originated as a re-branding of [[creation science]] in an attempt to get round a series of court decisions ruling out the teaching of creationism in U.S. public schools, and the Discovery Institute has run [[Discovery Institute intelligent design campaigns|a series of campaigns]] to change school curricula.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;/&gt; In Australia, where curricula are under the control of State governments rather than local school boards, there was a public outcry when the notion of ID being taught in science classes was raised by the Federal Education Minister [[Brendan Nelson]]; the minister quickly conceded that the correct forum for ID, if it were to be taught, is in religious or philosophy classes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/intelligent-design-not-science-experts/2005/10/20/1129775902661.html ''Intelligent design not science: experts''], Deborah Smith Science Editor, [[Sydney Morning Herald]], October 21, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, teaching of Intelligent Design in public schools has been decisively ruled by a Federal District court to be in violation of the [[Establishment Clause]] of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]]. In [[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]], the court found that intelligent design is not science and &quot;cannot uncouple itself from its creationist, and thus religious, antecedents.&quot;, and hence cannot be taught as an alternative to [[Evolution]] in public school science classrooms under the jurisdiction of that court. This sets a [[persuasive precedent]], based on previous Supreme Court decisions in [[Edwards v. Aguillard]] and [[Epperson v. Arkansas]], and by the application of the [[Lemon v. Kurtzman|Lemon test]], that creates a legal hurdle to teaching Intelligent Design in public school districts in other Federal court jurisdictions.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=kitz&gt;[[s:Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District et al.|Full text of Judge Jones' ruling, dated December 20, 2005]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hinduism===
{{Main|Hindu views on evolution}}
Some Hindus find support for, or foreshadowing of evolutionary ideas in [[Hindu scriptures|scriptures]], namely the [[Vedas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.well.com/user/jct/science.html | title=Science and spirituality: Any Points of Contact?

===Islam===
{{Main|Islamic creationism}}

Islamic creationism is the belief that the [[universe]] (including [[human race|humanity]]) was directly created by [[God in Islam|God]] as explained in the [[Qur'an]]. It usually views Genesis as a corrupted version of God's message. The creation myths in the Qur'an are vaguer and allow for a wider range of interpretations similar to those in other [[Abrahamic religions]]. Most Muslims accept the scientific positions on the age of the earth and the age of the universe.

Islam also has its own school of [[Evolutionary creation]]/Theistic evolutionism, which holds that mainstream scientific analysis of the origin of the universe is supported by the Qur'an. Some Muslims believe in evolutionary creation, especially among [[Liberal movements within Islam]].

[[Khalid Anees]], president of the [[Islamic Society of Britain]], at a conference called 'Creationism: Science and Faith in Schools', made points including the following:&lt;ref name=guardian0104&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://education.guardian.co.uk/conferences/story/0,,1117752,00.html|title=Creationism: Science and Faith in Schools|date=2004-01-07|work=Guardian|first=David |last=Papineau |accessdate=2008-07-18 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no contradiction between what is revealed in the [[Koran]] and [[natural selection]] and [[survival of the fittest]]. However, some Muslims, such as [[Adnan Oktar]], do not agree that one species can develop from another.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrizeforFossil&quot;&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/creationist-offers-prize-for-fossil-proof-of-evolution-945289.html | title=Creationist offers prize for fossil proof of evolution | publisher=[[The Independent]] |date= 29 September 2008  | first= Toby| last=  Green| accessdate =2007-05-17 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

But there is also a growing movement of [[Islamic creationism]]. Similar to Christian creationism, there is concern regarding the perceived conflicts between the [[Qur'an]] and the main points of [[evolution]]ary theory. The main location for this has been in Turkey, where fewer than 25% of people believe in evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.templeton-cambridge.org/fellows/showfellow.php?fellow=36 |title=Templeton-Cambridge.org |publisher=Templeton-Cambridge.org |date= |accessdate=2011-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several verses in the Qur'an which some modern writers have interpreted as being compatible with the [[Metric expansion of space|expansion of the universe]], [[Big Bang]] and [[Big Crunch]] theories:&lt;ref&gt;[[Harun Yahya]], [http://www.harunyahya.com/articles/70big_bang.html The Big Bang Echoes through the Map of the Galaxy]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Maurice Bucaille]] (1990), ''The Bible the Qur'an and Science'', &quot;The Quran and Modern Science&quot;, ISBN 8171011322.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. Abd-Allah, [http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/scislam.html The Qur'an, Knowledge, and Science], [[University of Southern California]].&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Do not the Unbelievers see that the skies (space) and the earth were joined together, then We (Allah) clove them asunder and We (Allah) created every living thing out of the water. Will they not then believe?&quot;{{Quran-usc|21|30}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Then turned He to the sky (space) when it was smoke, and said unto it and unto the earth: Come both of you, willingly or loth. They said: We come, obedient.&quot;{{Quran-usc|41|11}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;And it is We (Allah) Who have constructed the sky (space) with might, and it is We (Allah) Who are steadily expanding it.&quot;{{Quran-usc|51|47}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;On the day when We (Allah) will roll up the sky (space) like the rolling up of the scroll for writings, as We (Allah) originated the first creation, (so) We (Allah) shall reproduce it; a promise (binding on Us); surely We will bring it about.&quot;{{Quran-usc|21|104}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Ahmadiyya]] Movement is perhaps the only denomination in Islam that actively promotes [[evolution]]ary theory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://textonly.itl-usa.org/ahmadi/ahmadi13.html ITL: Jesus and the Indian Messiah - Every Wind of Doctrine]{{dead link|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Ahmadis interpret scripture from the Quran to support the concept of [[macroevolution]] and give precedence to scientific theories. Furthermore, unlike more orthodox Muslims, Ahmadis believe that mankind has gradually evolved from different species. Ahmadis regard [[Adam and Eve|Adam]] as being the first Prophet of God{{ndash}} as opposed to him being the first man on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20090130070102/http://textonly.itl-usa.org/ahmadi/ahmadi13.html ]&lt;/ref&gt;
Rather than wholly adopting the theory of [[natural selection]], Ahmadis promote the idea of a &quot;guided evolution&quot;, viewing each stage of the evolutionary process as having been selectively woven by God.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.alislam.org/library/articles/Guided_evolution_and_punctuated_equilibrium-20081104MN.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mirza Tahir Ahmad]], Fourth [[Khalifatul Masih|Caliph]] of the [[Ahmadiyya Muslim Community]] has stated in his magnum opus ''[[Revelation, Rationality, Knowledge &amp; Truth]]'' that evolution did occur but only through [[God]] being the One who brings it about. It does not occur itself, according to the [[Ahmadiyya Muslim Community]].

===Judaism===
{{Main|Judaism and evolution}}

Judaism has a continuum of views about creation, the origin of life and the role of evolution in the formation of species. The major [[Jewish denominations]], including many Orthodox Jewish groups, accept evolutionary creation or theistic evolution. Many Conservative Rabbis follow theistic evolution, although Conservative Judaism does not have an official view on the subject. Conservative Judaism however, does generally embrace science and therefore finds it a &quot;challenge to traditional Jewish theology.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/jewsevolution.html Judaism and Evolution], Jewish Virtual Library&lt;/ref&gt; Reform Judaism does not take the [[Torah]] as a literal text, but rather as a symbolic or open-ended work. For Orthodox Jews who seek to reconcile discrepancies between science and the Bible, the notion that science and the Bible should even be reconciled through traditional scientific means is questioned. To these groups, science is as true as the Torah and if there seems to be a problem, our own [[epistemological]] limits are to blame for any apparent irreconcilable point. They point to various discrepancies between what is expected and what actually is to demonstrate that things are not always as they appear. They point out the fact that the even root word for &quot;world&quot; in the [[Hebrew language]] — עולם (Olam) — means hidden — נעלם (Neh-Eh-Lahm). Just as they believe God created man and trees and the light on its way from the stars in their adult state, so too can they believe that the world was created in its &quot;adult&quot; state, with the understanding that there are, and can be, no physical ways to verify it. This belief has been advanced by Rabbi Dr. Dovid Gottlieb, former philosophy professor at Johns Hopkins University. Also, relatively old Kabbalistic sources from well before the scientifically apparent age of the universe was first determined are in close concord with modern scientific estimates of the age of the universe, according to Rabbi [[Aryeh Kaplan]], and based on Sefer Temunah, an early kabbalistic work attributed to the 1st century [[Tannaim|Tanna]] Nehunya ben ha-Kanah. Many kabbalists accepted the teachings of the Sefer Temunah, including the [[Nahmanides|Ramban]], his close student [[Isaac ben Samuel of Acre|Yitzhak of Akko]], and the [[David ben Solomon ibn Abi Zimra|RADBAZ]]. Other interesting parallels are derived, among other sources, from [[Nachmanides]], who expounds that there was a [[Neanderthal]]-like species with which [[Adam and Eve|Adam]] mated (he did this long before Neanderthals had even been discovered scientifically).&lt;ref&gt;Aviezer, Nathan.

Most vocal literalist creationists are from the United States, and strict creationist views are much less common in other developed countries.

===Canada===
A 2008 Canadian poll revealed that &quot;58 percent accept evolution, while 22 percent think that God created humans in their present form within the last 10,000 years.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://ncse.com/news/2008/08/polling-creationism-canada-001375 | title=Polling creationism in Canada | publisher=[[National Center for Science Education]] |date= August 8, 2008|accessdate =2008-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===
In Europe, literalist creationism is less well accepted, though regular opinion polls are not available. Most people accept that evolution is the most widely accepted scientific theory as taught in most schools. In countries with a [[Roman Catholic]] majority, [[Evolution and the Roman Catholic Church|papal acceptance of evolutionary creationism]] as worthy of study has essentially ended debate on the matter for many people.

In the [[United Kingdom]], the Archbishop of Canterbury [[Rowan Williams]], head of the worldwide [[Anglican Communion]], views the idea of teaching creationism in schools as a mistake.&lt;ref&gt;[http://education.guardian.co.uk/schools/story/0,,1735731,00.html ''Archbishop: stop teaching creationism-Williams backs science over Bible''], Stephen Bates, religious affairs correspondent, The Guardian, Tuesday March 21, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; A 2006 poll on the &quot;origin and development of life&quot; asked participants to choose between three different perspectives on the origin of life: 22% chose creationism, 17% opted for intelligent design, 48% selected evolutionary theory, and the rest did not know.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4648598.stm &quot;Britons unconvinced on evolution&quot;], ''[[BBC News]]'', 26 January 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/poll.aspx?oItemId=262 &quot;BBC Survey On The Origins Of Life&quot;], [[Ipsos MORI]] for ''[[BBC Horizon]]'', 30 January 2006&lt;/ref&gt; A subsequent November 2010 [[Yougov]] poll on the Origin of Humans found that now 9% opted for creationism, 12% intelligent design, 65% evolutionary theory and 13% didn't know.&lt;ref&gt;http://today.yougov.co.uk/sites/today.yougov.co.uk/files/YG-Archives-Pol-Prospect-Evolution-181110.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Exceptionally, in the United Kingdom the [[Emmanuel Schools Foundation]] (previously the Vardy Foundation), which runs three government-funded 13 to 19 schools in the north of England (out of several thousand in the country) teaches that creationism and evolution are equally valid &quot;faith positions&quot;. One exam board (OCR) also specifically mentions and deals with creationism in its biology syllabus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Donald MacLeod |url=http://education.guardian.co.uk/schools/story/0,,1728235,00.html |title=Exam board brings creationism into science class |publisher=Education.guardian.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this deals with it as a historical belief and addresses hostility towards evolution rather than promoting it as an alternative to naturalistic evolution. Mainstream scientific accounts are expressed as fact. In Italy, prime minister [[Silvio Berlusconi]] wanted to retire evolution from schools in the middle level; after one week of massive protests, he reversed his opinion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,1188423,00.html Italy Keeps Darwin in its Classrooms], [[Deutsche Welle]], 3 May 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

There continues to be scattered and possibly mounting efforts on the part of religious fundamentalists throughout Europe to introduce creationism into public education.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/world/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9036706 ''In the beginning: The debate over creation and evolution, once most conspicuous in America, is fast going global''], ISTANBUL, MOSCOW AND ROME, Evolution and religion, ''The Economist'', April 19th 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In response, the Parliamentary Assembly of the [[Council of Europe]] has released a draft report entitled ''The dangers of creationism in education'' on June 8, 2007,&lt;ref&gt;[http://assembly.coe.int/main.asp?Link=/documents/workingdocs/doc07/edoc11297.htm ''The dangers of creationism in education''], Committee on Culture, Science and Education, Rapporteur: Mr Guy LENGAGNE, France, Socialist Group, Doc. 11297, Parliamentary Assemble Council of Europe, June 8, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; reinforced by a further proposal of banning it in schools dated October 4, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://assembly.coe.int/Main.asp?link=/Documents/AdoptedText/ta07/ERES1580.htm ''The dangers of creationism in education - Resolution 1580''], Committee on Culture, Science and Education, Rapporteur: Mr Guy LENGAGNE, France, Socialist Group, Doc. 11297, Parliamentary Assemble Council of Europe, October 4, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Serbia]] suspended the teaching of evolution for one week in September 2004, under education minister [[Ljiljana Čolić]], only allowing schools to reintroduce evolution into the curriculum if they also taught creationism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1471367/Darwin-is-off-the-curriculum-for-Serbian-schools.html &quot;Darwin is off the curriculum for Serbian schools&quot;], [[telegraph.co.uk]], 9 September 2004&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;After a deluge of protest from scientists, teachers and opposition parties&quot; says the BBC report, Čolić's deputy made the statement, &quot;I have come here to confirm Charles Darwin is still alive&quot; and announced that the decision was reversed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3642460.stm &quot;Serbia reverses Darwin suspension&quot;], ''[[BBC News]]'', 9 September 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Čolić resigned after the government said that she had caused &quot;problems that had started to reflect on the work of the entire government.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3663196.stm &quot;'Anti-Darwin' Serb minister quits&quot;], ''[[BBC News]]'', 16 September 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Poland]] saw a major controversy over creationism in 2006 when the deputy education minister, [[Mirosław Orzechowski]], denounced evolution as &quot;one of many lies&quot; taught in Polish schools. His superior, Minister of Education [[Roman Giertych]], has stated that the theory of evolution would continue to be taught in Polish schools, &quot;as long as most scientists in our country say that it is the right theory.&quot; Giertych's father, [[Member of the European Parliament]] [[Maciej Giertych]], has opposed the teaching of evolution and has claimed that [[dinosaur]]s and humans co-existed.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.wbj.pl/?command=article&amp;id=35336&amp;type=wbj And finally...]&quot;, ''[[Warsaw Business Journal]]'', 18 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
[[Image:Creationist car.jpg|230px|right|thumb|Anti-evolution car in [[Athens, Georgia]]]]
According to a 2001 [[Gallup poll]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallup2007&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/14107/Third-Americans-Say-Evidence-Has-Supported-Darwins-Evolution-Theory.aspx |title=Majority of Americans Doubt Theory of Evolution |publisher=Gallup.com |date=2004-11-19 |accessdate=2011-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; about 45% of Americans believe that &quot;God created human beings pretty much in their present form at one time within the last 10,000 years or so.&quot; Another 37% believe that &quot;human beings have developed over millions of years from less advanced forms of life, but God guided this process&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;poll2001Gallup&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unl.edu/rhames/courses/current/creation/evol-poll.htm |title=Substantial Numbers of Americans Continue to Doubt Evolution as Explanation for Origin of Humans |publisher=Unl.edu |date=2001-03-05 |accessdate=2011-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 14% believe that &quot;human beings have developed over millions of years from less advanced forms of life, but God had no part in this process&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallup2007&quot;/&gt;

Belief in creationism is inversely correlated to education; of those with [[postgraduate degree]]s, 74% accept evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Newport, [http://www.gallup.com/video/27838/Evolution-Beliefs.aspx &quot;Evolution Beliefs.&quot;] Gallup Organization, June 11, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.religioustolerance.org/ev_publi.htm &quot;Public beliefs about evolution and creation.&quot;] From: religioustolerance.org.

A 2000 poll for [[People for the American Way]] found 70% of the [[United States]] public felt that evolution was compatible with a belief in God.&lt;ref name=&quot;pfaw&quot;&gt;{{PDFlink|[http://media.pfaw.org/pdf/creationism/creationism-poll.pdf Evolution and Creationism In Public Education: An In-depth Reading Of Public Opinion]|481&amp;nbsp;KB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a study published in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', between 1985 and 2005 the number of adult North Americans who accept evolution declined from 45% to 40%, the number of adults who reject evolution declined from 48% to 39% and the number of people who were unsure increased from 7% to 21%. Besides the United States the study also compared data from 32 European countries, Turkey, and Japan. The only country where acceptance of evolution was lower than in the United States was Turkey (25%).&lt;ref name=&quot;Science survey&quot;/&gt;

====Education controversies====
[[File:Truth fish.jpg|thumb|right|The Truth fish, one of the many creationist responses to the [[Parodies of the ichthys symbol|Darwin fish]].]]
{{Main|Creation-evolution controversy}}
In the United States, creationism has become centered in the [[politics|political]] [[creation-evolution controversy|controversy]] over [[creation and evolution in public education]], and whether teaching creationism in science classes conflicts with the [[separation of church and state]]. Currently, the controversy comes in the form of whether advocates of the [[Intelligent Design movement]] who wish to &quot;[[Teach the Controversy]]&quot; in science classes have conflated [[religion and science|science with religion]].&lt;ref name=&quot;kitz&quot;/&gt;

[[People for the American Way]] polled 1500 North Americans about the teaching of evolution and creationism in November and December 1999. They found that most North Americans were not familiar with Creationism, and most North Americans had heard of evolution, but many did not fully understand the basics of the theory. The main findings were:
{{bar box

{{bar percent|Public schools should teach evolution only|silver|60|20%}}

{{bar percent|No opinion|silver|3|1%}}
}}

In such political contexts, creationists argue that their particular religiously based origin belief is superior to those of other [[belief systems]], in particular those made through secular or scientific rationale. Political creationists are opposed by many individuals and organizations who have made detailed critiques and given testimony in various court cases that the [[objections to evolution|alternatives to scientific reasoning offered by creationists]] are opposed by the [[scientific consensus|consensus]] of the [[scientific community]].&lt;ref name=&quot;aaas&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aaas.org/news/releases/2006/pdf/0219boardstatement.pdf|title=Statement on the Teaching of Evolution|publisher=American Association for the Advancement of Science|format=PDF|year=2006|accessdate=2007-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;99.9 percent of scientists accept evolution&quot; [http://www.nih.gov/nihrecord/07_28_2006/story03.htm Finding the Evolution in Medicine] [[National Institutes of Health]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christian criticism==
Many Christians disagree with the teaching of creationism. Several religious organizations, among them the [[Catholic Church and evolution|Catholic Church]], hold that their faith does not conflict with the scientific consensus regarding evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ncse.com/media/voices/religion |title=National Center for Science Education: Statements from Religious Organizations |publisher=Ncse.com |date=2003-10-14 |accessdate=2011-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Clergy Letter Project]], which has collected more than 13,000 signatures, is an &quot;endeavor designed to demonstrate that religion and science can be compatible&quot;.

In his 2002 article &quot;Intelligent Design as a Theological Problem&quot;, George Murphy argues against the view that [[life on Earth]], in all its forms, is direct evidence of God's act of creation (Murphy quotes Phillip Johnson's claim that he is speaking &quot;of a God who acted openly and left his fingerprints on all the evidence.&quot;). Murphy argues that this view of God is incompatible with the Christian understanding of God as &quot;the one revealed in the cross and resurrection of [[Jesus]].&quot; The basis of this theology is [[Isaiah]] 45:15, &quot;Truly, thou art a God who hidest thyself, O God of Israel, the Savior.&quot;

Murphy observes that the execution of a Jewish carpenter by Roman authorities is in and of itself an ordinary event and did not require Divine action. On the contrary, for the crucifixion to occur, God had to limit or &quot;empty&quot; Himself. It was for this reason that Paul wrote, in Philippians 2:5-8,
:Have this mind among yourselves, which is yours in Christ Jesus, who, though he was in the form of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied himself, taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men. And being found in human form he humbled himself and became obedient unto death, even death on a cross.

Murphy concludes that,&lt;blockquote&gt;Just as the son of God limited himself by taking human form and dying on the cross, God limits divine action in the world to be in accord with rational laws God has chosen. This enables us to understand the world on its own terms, but it also means that natural processes hide God from scientific observation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;For Murphy, a theology of the cross requires that Christians accept a [[Methodological naturalism|''methodological'' naturalism]], meaning that one cannot invoke God to explain natural phenomena, while recognizing that such acceptance does not require one to accept a [[Metaphysical naturalism|''metaphysical'' naturalism]], which proposes that nature is all that there is.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, George L., 2002, &quot;Intelligent Design as a Theological Problem,&quot; in ''Covalence: the Bulletin of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America Alliance for Faith, Science, and Technology''&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Christians have expressed qualms about teaching creationism. In March 2006, Archbishop of Canterbury [[Rowan Williams]], the leader of the world's Anglicans, stated his discomfort about teaching creationism, saying that creationism was &quot;a kind of [[category mistake]], as if the Bible were a theory like other theories&quot;. He also said: &quot;My worry is creationism can end up reducing the doctrine of creation rather than enhancing it.&quot; The views of the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]] - a major American-based branch of the [[Anglican Communion]] - on teaching creationism resemble those of Williams.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/religion/Story/0,,1735730,00.html '''The Guardian''', Archbishop: Stop teaching creationism, Williams backs science over Bible] See transcript of Guardian interview for primary source&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2010 the [[American Academy of Religion]] issued ''Guidelines for Teaching About Religion in K‐12 Public Schools in the United States'' which included guidance that [[creation science]] or [[intelligent design]] should not be taught in science classes, as &quot;Creation science and intelligent design represent worldviews that fall outside of the realm of science that is defined as (and limited to) a method of inquiry based on gathering observable and measurable evidence subject to specific principles of reasoning.&quot; However, they, as well as other &quot;worldviews that focus on speculation regarding the origins of life represent another important and relevant form of human inquiry that is appropriately studied in literature or social sciences courses. Such study, however, must include a diversity of worldviews representing a variety of religious and philosophical perspectives and must avoid privileging one view as more legitimate than others.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ncse.com/news/2010/07/american-academy-religion-teaching-creationism-005712 |title=American Academy of Religion on teaching creationism |date=July 23, 2010 |publisher=National Center for Science Education |quote= |accessdate=2010-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific criticism==
{{Main|Creation&amp;ndash;evolution controversy}}

Science is a system of knowledge based on observation, empirical evidence and testable explanations and predictions of natural phenomena. By contrast, creationism is based on literal interpretations of the narratives of particular religious texts. Some creationist beliefs involve purported forces that lie outside of nature, such as supernatural intervention, and often do not allow predictions at all. Therefore, these can neither be confirmed nor disproved by scientists.&lt;ref name=SEaC&gt;{{Cite book|author=Committee on Revising Science and Creationism: A View from the National Academy of Sciences, National Academy of Sciences and Institute of Medicine of the National Academies |authorlink=United States National Academies |editor= |others= |title=Science, Evolution, and Creationism |edition=free pdf download |publisher=[[National Academies Press]] |location=Washington, D.C. |year=2008 |origyear= |pages=10–12 |quote=In science, explanations must be based on naturally occurring phenomena.

[[Protoscience|Early science]] incorporated elements of these beliefs, but as science developed these beliefs were gradually [[Falsifiability|falsified]] and were replaced with understandings based on accumulated and reproducible evidence that often allows the accurate prediction of future results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/index.html |title=An Index to Creationist Claims |work= |accessdate=2008-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biologi.kva.se/arkiv/FutuymaCh22final.pdf |title=Evolutionary Science, Creationism, and Society |format=PDF |work=&quot;Evolution&quot; (2005)|last=Futuyma |first=Douglas J. |accessdate=2008-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scientists, such as [[Stephen Jay Gould]],&lt;ref name=RoA&gt;Gould, S. J. (2002). ''[[Rocks of Ages|Rocks of Ages: Science and Religion in the Fullness of Life]]''. New York: Ballantine Books.&lt;/ref&gt; consider science and religion to be two compatible and complementary fields, with authorities in distinct areas of human experience, so-called [[non-overlapping magisteria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first = Stephen Jay|last = Gould|year = 1997|url = http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/gould_noma.html|title = Nonoverlapping Magisteria|journal = Natural History|volume = 106|pages = 16–22|issue = 3|ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view is also held by many theologians, who believe that [[primum movens|ultimate origins]] and [[meaning of life|meaning]] are addressed by religion, but favour verifiable scientific explanations of natural phenomena over those of creationist beliefs. Other scientists, such as [[Richard Dawkins]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The God Delusion |last=Dawkins |first=Richard |year=2006 |publisher=Transworld Publishers |isbn=0-5930-5548-9 |location= |page=5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; reject the non-overlapping magisteria and argue that, in disproving literal interpretations of creationists, the scientific method also undermines religious texts as a source of truth. Irrespective of this diversity in viewpoints, since creationist beliefs are not supported by empirical evidence, the [[scientific consensus]] is that any attempt to teach creationism as science should be rejected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title =Royal Society statement on evolution, creationism and intelligent design  | publisher =The Royal Society  | date =2006-04-11 | url =http://www.royalsoc.ac.uk/news.asp?year=&amp;id=4298  | accessdate =2007-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = 10 Significant Court Decisions Regarding Evolution/Creationism  | publisher =[[National Center for Science Education]] |last= Matsumura |first=Molleen |coauthors=Mead, Louise  | date =2007-07-31 | url = http://ncse.com/taking-action/ten-major-court-cases-evolution-creationism  | accessdate =2008-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| title = Ann Coulter: No Evidence for Evolution? | publisher = ScienceBlogs | journal = Pharyngula |last= Myers |first= PZ | date =2006-02-15 | url = http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2006/06/ann_coulter_no_evidence_for_ev.php  | accessdate =2007-09-12   | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Chad''' ({{lang-ar|تشاد }}; {{lang-fr|Tchad}}), officially the '''Republic of Chad''', is a [[landlocked]] country in [[Central Africa]]. It borders [[Libya]] to the north, [[Sudan]] to the east, the [[Central African Republic]] to the south, [[Cameroon]] and [[Nigeria]] to the southwest, and [[Niger]] to the west. Due to its distance from the sea and its largely [[desert]] climate, the country is sometimes referred to as the [http://www.guernicamag.com/features/199/swarms_at_the_border/ &quot;Dead Heart of Africa&quot;].

}}&lt;/ref&gt; A possibly [[hominid]] [[hominid skull|skull]] has been found in 2002 in [[Borkou]] that is more than 7 million years old; it has been given the name [[Sahelanthropus tchadensis]]. In 1996 a hominid [[jaw]] was found and given the scientific name [[Australopithecus bahrelghazali]] and unofficially dubbed [[Abel (hominid)|Abel]]. It was dated using Berylium based Radiometric dating as living circa. 3.6 million years ago. 

During the [[7th millennium]] [[Anno Domini|BC]], the northern half of Chad was part of a broad expanse of land, stretching from the [[Indus River]] in the east to the [[Atlantic Ocean]] in the west, in which [[ecology|ecological]] conditions favored early human settlement. [[Rock art]] of the &quot;Round Head&quot; style, found in the [[Ennedi]] region, has been dated to before the 7th millennium BC and, because of the tools with which the rocks were carved and the scenes they depict, may represent the oldest evidence in the [[Sahara]] of [[Neolithic]] industries. Many of the [[pottery]]-making and Neolithic activities in Ennedi date back further than any of those of the [[Nile]] Valley to the east.&lt;ref name=&quot;locchad&quot; /&gt;

In the [[prehistory|prehistoric]] period, Chad was much wetter than it is today, as evidenced by large game animals depicted in [[Cave painting|rock paintings]] in the [[Tibesti]] and Borkou regions.&lt;ref name=&quot;locchad&quot; /&gt;

Recent linguistic research suggests that all of [[Africa]]'s languages south of the Sahara Desert (except [[Khoisan languages|Khoisan]]) originated in prehistoric times in a narrow band between [[Lake Chad]] and the Nile Valley. The origins of Chad's peoples, however, remain unclear. Several of the proven archaeological sites have been only partially studied, and other sites of great potential have yet to be mapped.&lt;ref name=&quot;locchad&quot; /&gt;

==Era of Empires (AD 900&amp;ndash;1900)==
Toward the end of the 1st millennium AD, the formation of states began across central Chad in the [[sahel]]ian zone between the [[desert]] and the [[savanna]]. For almost the next 1,000 years, these states, their relations with each other, and their effects on the peoples who lived in stateless societies along their peripheries dominated Chad's political history. Recent research suggests that indigenous [[History of Africa|Africans]] founded most of these states, not migrating [[Arabic language|Arabic-speaking]] groups, as was believed previously. Nonetheless, immigrants, [[Arab]]ic-speaking or otherwise, played a significant role, along with [[Islam]], in the formation and early evolution of these states.&lt;ref name=&quot;locchad14&quot;&gt;Collier 1990 p.14&lt;/ref&gt;

Most states began as [[monarchy|kingdoms]], in which the [[monarch|king]] was considered divine and endowed with temporal and spiritual powers. All states were [[militarism|militaristic]] (or they did not survive long), but none was able to expand far into southern Chad, where forests and the [[tsetse fly]] complicated the use of [[cavalry]]. Control over the [[trans-Saharan trade]] routes that passed through the region formed the economic basis of these kingdoms. Although many states rose and fell, the most important and durable of the empires were [[Kanem Empire|Kanem-Bornu]], [[Kingdom of Baguirmi|Baguirmi]], and [[Ouaddai Empire|Ouaddai]], according to most written sources (mainly [[Noble court|court]] [[chronicle]]s and writings of Arab [[merchant|traders]] and travelers).&lt;ref name=&quot;locchad14&quot; /&gt;[http://countrystudies.us/chad/5.htm]

===Kanem-Bornu===
{{main|Kanem-Bornu Empire}}
The Kanem Empire originated in the 9th century AD to the northeast of [[Lake Chad]]. Historians agree that the leaders of the new state were ancestors of the [[Kanem Empire|Kanembu]] people. Toward the end of the 11th century the [[Sayfawa dynasty|Sayfawa]] king (or ''mai'', the title of the Sayfawa rulers) [[Hummay]], converted to Islam. In the following century the Sayfawa rulers expandeded southward into [[Kanem (region)|Kanem]], where was to rise their first capital, [[Njimi]]. Kanem's expansion peaked during the long and energetic reign of Mai [[Dunama Dabbalemi]] (c. 1221&amp;ndash;1259).&lt;ref name=&quot;locchad15&quot;&gt;Collier 1990 p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Group of Kanem-Bu warriors.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Group of Kanem-Bu warriors]]

By the end of the 14th century, internal struggles and external attacks had torn Kanem apart. Finally, around 1396 the [[Bulala]] invaders forced ''Mai'' [[Umar Idrismi]] to abandon Njimi and move the Kanembu people to [[Borno State|Bornu]] on the western edge of Lake Chad. Over time, the intermarriage of the Kanembu and Bornu peoples created a new people and language, the [[Kanuri people|Kanuri]], and founded a new capital, [[Ngazargamu]].&lt;ref name=&quot;locchad15&quot; /&gt;

Kanem-Bornu peaked during the reign of the outstanding statesman ''Mai'' [[Idris Aluma]] (c. 1571&amp;ndash;1603). Aluma is remembered for his military skills, administrative reforms, and Islamic piety. The administrative reforms and military brilliance of Aluma sustained the empire until the mid-17th century, when its power began to fade. By the early 19th century, Kanem-Bornu was clearly an empire in decline, and in 1808 [[Fulani Empire|Fulani]] warriors conquered Ngazargamu. Bornu survived, but the Sayfawa dynasty ended in 1846 and the Empire itself fell in 1893.&lt;ref name=&quot;locchad15&quot; /&gt;

===Baguirmi and Ouaddai===
{{main|kingdom of Baguirmi|Ouaddai Kingdom}}
In addition to Kanem-Bornu, two other states in the region, [[Kingdom of Baguirmi|Baguirmi]] and [[Ouaddai Kingdom|Ouaddai]], achieved historical prominence. Baguirmi emerged to the southeast of Kanem-Bornu in the 16th century. [[Islam]] was adopted, and the state became a [[sultan]]ate. Absorbed into Kanem-Bornu, Baguirmi broke free later in the 17th century, only to be returned to [[tribute|tributary]] status in the mid-18th century. Early in the 19th century, Baguirmi fell into decay and was threatened militarily by the nearby kingdom of Ouaddai. Although Baguirmi resisted, it accepted tributary status in order to obtain help from Ouaddai in putting down internal dissension. When the capital was burned in 1893, the sultan sought and received [[protectorate]] status from the [[French colonial empires|French]].&lt;ref name=&quot;locchad16&quot;&gt;Collier 1990 p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

Located northeast of Baguirmi, Ouaddai was a non-Muslim kingdom that emerged in the 16th century as an offshoot of the state of [[Darfur]] (in present-day [[Sudan]]). Early in the 17th century, groups in the region rallied to [[Abd al-Karim of Ouaddai|Abd al-Karim]], who overthrew the ruling [[Tunjur]] group, transforming Ouaddai in an Islamic [[sultan]]ate. During much of the 18th century, Ouaddai resisted reincorporation into Darfur.&lt;ref name=&quot;locchad16&quot; /&gt;

In about 1800, under the rule of [[Sabun]], the sultanate began to expand its power. A new trade route north was discovered, and Sabun outfitted royal caravans to take advantage of it. He began minting his own coinage and imported [[chain mail]], [[firearm]]s, and military advisers from [[North Africa]]. Sabun's successors were less able than he, and Darfur took advantage of a disputed political succession in 1838 to put its own candidate in power. This tactic backfired when Darfur's choice, [[Muhammad Sharif of Ouaddai|Muhammad Sharif]], rejected Darfur and asserted his own authority. In doing so, he gained acceptance from Ouaddai's various factions and went on to become Ouaddai's ablest ruler. Sharif eventually established Ouaddai's hegemony over Baguirmi and kingdoms as far away as the [[Chari River]]. The Ouaddai opposed French domination until well into the 20th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;locchad16&quot; /&gt;

==Colonialism (1900&amp;ndash;40)==
{{main|Colonial Chad}}
[[Image:Mort du Commandant Lamy.jpg|thumb|200px|Death of Commander Lamy of France, 1900]]The [[France|French]] first penetrated Chad in 1891, establishing their authority through military expeditions primarily against the Muslim kingdoms. The decisive colonial battle for Chad was fought on April 22, 1900 at [[Battle of Kousséri]] between forces of French [[Major]] [[Amédée-François Lamy]] and forces of the [[Sudan]]ese warlord [[Rabih az-Zubayr]]. Both leaders were killed in the battle.

In 1905, administrative responsibility for Chad was placed under a [[governor-general]] stationed at [[Brazzaville]], capital of [[French Equatorial Africa]] (AEF). Chad did not have a separate colonial status until 1920, when it was placed under a [[lieutenant-governor]] stationed in [[Fort-Lamy]] (today N'Djamena).&lt;ref name=&quot;locchad17&quot;&gt;Collier 1990 p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

Two fundamental themes dominated Chad's colonial experience with the French: an absence of policies designed to unify the territory and an exceptionally slow pace of [[modernization]]. In the French scale of priorities, the [[colony]] of Chad ranked near the bottom, and the French came to perceive Chad primarily as a source of raw [[cotton]] and [[manual labour|untrained labour]] to be used in the more productive colonies to the south.&lt;ref name=&quot;locchad17&quot; /&gt;

Throughout the colonial period, large areas of Chad were never governed effectively: in the huge [[BET Prefecture]], the handful of French military administrators usually left the people alone, and in central Chad, French rule was only slightly more substantive. Truly speaking, France managed to govern effectively only the south.&lt;ref name=&quot;locchad17&quot; /&gt;

==Decolonization (1940&amp;ndash;60)==
{{main|Decolonization in Chad}}
[[Image:Eboue wwII prop 03-0118a.jpg|thumb|200px|Félix Éboué in a contemporary World War II cartoon]]During [[World War II]], Chad was the first French [[colony]] to rejoin the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] (August 26, 1940), after the [[Battle of France|defeat of France by Germany]]. Under the administration of [[Félix Éboué]], France's first black colonial governor, a military column, commanded by Colonel [[Philippe Leclerc de Hauteclocque]], and including two battalions of [[Sara people|Sara]] troops, moved north from [[N'Djamena]] (then Fort Lamy) to engage [[Axis powers of World War II|Axis]] forces in [[Libya]], where, in partnership with the British Army's [[Long Range Desert Group]], they captured [[Kufra]].

After the war ended local parties started to develop in Chad. The first to be born was the conservative [[Chadian Democratic Union]] (UDT), which represented French commercial interests and a bloc of traditional leaders composed primarily of Muslim and [[Ouaddai Kingdom|Ouaddaïan]] nobility. Shortly after a more radical formation was created, the [[Chadian Progressive Party]] (PPT), eventually headed by [[François Tombalbaye]], which was to win the pre-independence elections. The confrontation between the PPT and UDT was more than simply ideological; it represented different regional identities, with the PPT representing the Christian and [[Animism|animist]] south and the UDT the Islamic north. 

After a referendum on territorial autonomy (September 28, 1958), French Equatorial Africa was dissolved, and its four constituent states &amp;ndash; [[Gabon]], [[Republic of the Congo|Congo (Brazzaville)]], the [[Central African Republic]], and Chad became autonomous members of the [[French Community]] (November 28, 1958). On August 11, 1960, Chad became an independent nation under its first president, François Tombalbaye.

==The Tombalbaye era (1960&amp;ndash;75)==
{{main|The Tombalbaye Regime}}
One of the most prominent aspects of Tombalbaye's rule to prove itself was his authoritarianism and distrust of democracy. Already in January 1962 he banned all political parties except his own PPT, and started immediately concentrating all power in his own hands. His treatment of opponents, real or imagined, was extremely harsh, filling the prisons with thousands of political prisoners.

What was even worse was his constant discrimination against the central and northern regions of Chad, where the southern Chadian administrators came to be perceived as arrogant and incompetent. This resentment at last exploded in a tax revolt on November 1, 1965, in the [[Guéra Prefecture|Guéra]] [[Prefectures of Chad|Prefecture]], causing 500 deaths. The year after saw the birth in [[Sudan]] of the [[FROLINAT|National Liberation Front of Chad]] (FROLINAT), created to militarily oust Tombalbaye and the Southern dominance. It was the start of a bloody civil war.

Tombalbaye resorted to calling in French troops; while moderately successful, they were not fully able to quell the insurgency. Proving more fortunate was his choice to break with the French and seek friendly ties with [[Libya]]n president [[Muammar al-Gaddafi|Qaddafi]], taking away the rebels' principal source of supplies.

But while he had reported some success against the rebels, Tombalbaye started behaving more and more irrationally and brutally, continuously eroding his consensus among the southern elites, which dominated all key positions in the army, the civil service and the ruling party. As a consequence on April 13, 1975, several units of N'Djamena's [[gendarmerie]] [[Chadian coup of 1975|killed Tombalbaye during a coup]].

==Military rule (1975&amp;ndash;78)==
{{main|Malloum's military government}}
The [[coup d'état]] that terminated Tombalbaye's government received an enthusiastic response in [[N'Djamena]]. The southerner [[General]] [[Félix Malloum]] emerged early as the chairman of the new ''[[Military dictatorship|junta]]''.

The new military leaders were unable to retain for long the popularity that they had gained through their overthrow of Tombalbaye. Malloum proved himself unable to cope with the [[FROLINAT]] and at the end decided his only chance was in coopting some of the rebels: in 1978 he allied himself with the insurgent leader [[Hissène Habré]], who entered the government as prime minister.

==Civil war (1979-82)==
{{main|Transitional Government of National Unity}}
Internal dissent within the government led Prime Minister Habré to send his forces against Malloum's national army in the capital in February 1979. Malloum was ousted from the presidency, but the resulting civil war amongst the 11 emergent factions was so widespread that it rendered the central government largely irrelevant. At that point, other African governments decided to intervene.

A series of four international conferences held first under Nigerian and then [[Organization of African Unity]] (OAU) sponsorship attempted to bring the Chadian factions together. At the fourth conference, held in [[Lagos]], [[Nigeria]], in August 1979, the Lagos Accord was signed. This accord established a transitional government pending national elections. In November 1979, the [[Transitional Government of National Unity]] (GUNT) was created with a mandate to govern for 18 months. [[Goukouni Oueddei]], a northerner, was named President; Colonel [[Wadel Abdelkader Kamougué|Kamougué]], a southerner, Vice President; and Habré, Minister of Defense. This coalition proved fragile; in January 1980, fighting broke out again between Goukouni's and Habré's forces. With assistance from [[Libya]], Goukouni regained control of the capital and other urban centers by year’s end. However, Goukouni’s January 1981 statement that Chad and [[Libya]] had agreed to work for the realization of complete unity between the two countries generated intense international pressure and Goukouni's subsequent call for the complete withdrawal of external forces.

==The Habré era (1982&amp;ndash;90)==
:''see: [[Chadian-Libyan conflict]]''
Libya's partial withdrawal to the [[Aozou Strip]] in northern Chad cleared the way for Habré's forces to enter N’Djamena in June. French troops and an OAU peacekeeping force of 3,500 Nigerian, [[Senegal]]ese, and [[Zaire|Zairian]] troops (partially funded by the [[United States]]) remained neutral during the conflict.
[[File:Tschad GUNT.jpg|thumb|The [[Aozou Strip]] (dark green), claimed and occupied by Libya between 1976 and 1987, and territories held by Libyan-backed GUNT-forces (light green)]]

Habré continued to face armed opposition on various fronts, and was brutal in his repression of suspected opponents, massacring and torturing many during his rule. In the summer of 1983, GUNT forces launched an offensive against government positions in northern and eastern Chad with heavy Libyan support. In response to Libya's direct intervention, French and Zairian forces intervened to defend Habré, pushing Libyan and rebel forces north of the [[16th parallel north|16th parallel]]. In September 1984, the French and the Libyan governments announced an agreement for the mutual withdrawal of their forces from Chad. By the end of the year, all French and Zairian troops were withdrawn. Libya did not honor the withdrawal accord, and its forces continued to occupy the northern third of Chad.

Rebel commando groups ([[Codos]]) in southern Chad were broken up by government massacres in 1984. In 1985 Habré briefly reconciled with some of his opponents, including the [[Democratic Front of Chad]] (FDT) and the [[Coordinating Action Committee of the Democratic Revolutionary Council]]. Goukouni also began to rally toward Habré, and with his support Habré successfully expelled Libyan forces from most of Chadian territory. A cease-fire between Chad and Libya held from 1987 to 1988, and negotiations over the next several years led to the 1994 International Court of Justice decision granting Chad sovereignty over the Aouzou strip, effectively ending Libyan occupation.

==The Déby era==
===Rise to power===
However, rivalry between [[Hadjerai]], [[Zaghawa people|Zaghawa]] and [[Gorane]] groups within the government grew in the late 1980s. In April 1989, [[Idriss Déby]], one of Habré's leading generals and a Zaghawa, defected and fled to [[Darfur]] in Sudan, from which he mounted a Zaghawa-supported series of attacks on Habré (a Gorane). In December 1990, with Libyan assistance and no opposition from French troops stationed in Chad, Déby’s forces successfully marched on N’Djamena. After 3 months of provisional government, Déby’s [[Patriotic Salvation Movement]] (MPS) approved a national charter on February 28, 1991, with Déby as president.

During the next two years, Déby faced at least two coup attempts. Government forces clashed violently with rebel forces, including the Movement for Democracy and Development, MDD, National Revival Committee for Peace and Democracy (CSNPD), Chadian National Front (FNT) and the Western Armed Forces (FAO), near [[Lake Chad]] and in southern regions of the country. Earlier French demands for the country to hold a National Conference resulted in the gathering of 750 delegates representing political parties (which were legalized in 1992), the government, trade unions and the army to discuss the creation of a pluralist democratic regime.

However, unrest continued, sparked in part by large-scale killings of civilians in southern Chad. The CSNPD, led by [[Kette Moise]] and other southern groups entered into a peace agreement with government forces in 1994, which later broke down. Two new groups, the Armed Forces for a Federal Republic (FARF) led by former Kette ally [[Laokein Barde]] and the Democratic Front for Renewal (FDR), and a reformulated MDD clashed with government forces from 1994 to 1995.

===Multiparty elections===
Talks with political opponents in early 1996 did not go well, but Déby announced his intent to hold presidential elections in June. Déby won the country’s first multi-party presidential elections with support in the second round from opposition leader Kebzabo, defeating General Kamougue (leader of the 1975 coup against Tombalbaye). Déby’s MPS party won 63 of 125 seats in the January 1997 legislative elections. International observers noted numerous serious irregularities in presidential and legislative election proceedings.

By mid-1997 the government signed peace deals with FARF and the MDD leadership and succeeded in cutting off the groups from their rear bases in the Central African Republic and Cameroon. Agreements also were struck with rebels from the National Front of Chad (FNT) and Movement for Social Justice and Democracy in October 1997. However, peace was short-lived, as FARF rebels clashed with government soldiers, finally surrendering to government forces in May 1998. Barde was killed in the fighting, as were hundreds of other southerners, most civilians.

Since October 1998, Chadian Movement for Justice and Democracy (MDJT) rebels, led by [[Youssuf Togoimi]] until his death in September 2002, have skirmished with government troops in the Tibesti region, resulting in hundreds of civilian, government, and rebel casualties, but little ground won or lost. No active armed opposition has emerged in other parts of Chad, although Kette Moise, following senior postings at the Ministry of Interior, mounted a smallscale local operation near [[Moundou]] which was quickly and violently suppressed by government forces in late 2000.

Déby, in the mid-1990s, gradually restored basic functions of government and entered into agreements with the [[World Bank]] and [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] to carry out substantial economic reforms. Oil exploitation in the southern Doba region began in June 2000, with World Bank Board approval to finance a small portion of a project, the [[Chad-Cameroon Petroleum Development Project]], aimed at transport of Chadian crude through a 1000-km. buried pipeline through Cameroon to the [[Gulf of Guinea]]. The project established unique mechanisms for World Bank, private sector, government, and civil society collaboration to guarantee that future oil revenues benefit local populations and result in poverty alleviation. Success of the project depended on [http://go.worldbank.org/5MGHQ1ZQ01 multiple  monitoring efforts]&lt;ref&gt;International Advisory Group, External Compliance Monitoring Group, Collège de Contrôle et de Surveillance des Revenues Pétroliers (CCSRP),  World Bank Inspection Panel, Comité Technique National de Suivi et de Contrôle (CTNSC).&lt;/ref&gt; to ensure that all parties keep their commitments. These &quot;unique&quot; mechanisms for monitoring and revenue management have faced intense criticism from the beginning.&lt;ref&gt;[http://crs.org/publications/showpdf.cfm?pdf_id=187 Gary, Ian (Catholic Relief Services) and Nikki Reisch (Bank Information Center). Chad's Oil: Miracle or Mirage?]&lt;/ref&gt; Debt relief was accorded to Chad in May 2001.

Déby won a flawed 63% first-round victory in May 2001 presidential elections after legislative elections were postponed until spring 2002. Having accused the government of fraud, six opposition leaders were arrested (twice) and one opposition party activist was killed following the announcement of election results. However, despite claims of government corruption, favoritism of Zaghawas, and abuses by the security forces, opposition party and labor union calls for general strikes and more active demonstrations against the government have been unsuccessful. Despite movement toward democratic reform, power remains in the hands of a northern ethnic oligarchy.

In 2003, Chad began receiving refugees from the [[Darfur]] region of western Sudan. More than 200,000 refugees fled the fighting between two rebel groups and government-supported militias known as [[Janjaweed]]. A number of border incidents led to the [[Chadian-Sudanese War]].

===War in the East===
{{main|War in Chad (2005–present)}}
[[Image:Civil war in Chad.png|thumb|200px|Hot spots in the present civil war.]]The war started on December 23, 2005, when the [[Politics of Chad|government of Chad]] declared a [[state of war]] with [[Sudan]] and called for the citizens of [[Chad]] to mobilize themselves against the &quot;common enemy,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/4556576.stm Chad in 'state of war' with Sudan] by Stephanie Hancock, [[BBC News]].&lt;/ref&gt; which the Chadian government sees as the [[Rally for Democracy and Liberty]] (RDL) militants, Chadian rebels, backed by the [[Sudanese]] government, and Sudanese militiamen. Militants have attacked villages and towns in eastern Chad, stealing cattle, murdering citizens, and burning houses. Over 200,000 refugees from the [[Darfur]] region of northwestern Sudan currently claim asylum in eastern Chad. Chadian president [[Idriss Déby]] accuses Sudanese President [[Omar Hasan Ahmad al-Bashir]] of trying to &quot;destabilize our country, to drive our people into misery, to create disorder and export the war from Darfur to Chad.&quot;

An attack on the Chadian town of [[Adre, Chad|Adre]] near the Sudanese border led to the deaths of either one hundred rebels, as every news source other than [[CNN]] has reported, or three hundred rebels. The Sudanese government was blamed for the attack, which was the second in the region in three days,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/4544352.stm Chad fightback 'kills 300 rebels'], [[BBC News]].&lt;/ref&gt; but Sudanese foreign ministry spokesman [[Jamal Mohammed Ibrahim]] denies any Sudanese involvement, &quot;We are not for any escalation with Chad. We technically deny involvement in Chadian internal affairs.&quot; This attack was the final straw that led to the declaration of war by Chad and the alleged deployment of the Chadian airforce into Sudanese airspace, which the Chadian government denies.&lt;ref&gt;Al Jazeera&lt;/ref&gt;

An attack on N'Djamena was defeated on April 13, 2006 in the [[Battle of N'Djamena (2006)|Battle of N'Djamena]]. The President on national radio stated that the situation was under control, but residents, diplomats and journalists reportedly heard shots of weapons fire.

On November 25, 2006, rebels captured the eastern town of [[Abeche]], capital of the [[Ouaddaï Region]] and center for humanitarian aid to the [[Darfur]] region in [[Sudan]]. On the same day, a separate rebel group [[Rally of Democratic Forces]] had captured [[Biltine, Chad|Biltine]]. On November 26, 2006, the Chadian government claimed to have recaptured both towns, although rebels still claimed control of [[Biltine, Chad|Biltine]]. Government buildings and humanitarian aid offices in Abeche were said to have been looted. The Chadian government denied a warning issued by the French Embassy in [[N'Djamena]] that a group of rebels was making its way through the [[Batha Prefecture]] in central Chad. Chad insists that both rebel groups are supported by the Sudanese government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= Chad denies rebel move on capital| date=November 26, 2006 | publisher=[[BBC]] | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6185074.stm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rebel attack on Ndjamena ===
{{Main|Battle of N'Djamena (2008)}}
On Friday, February 1, 2008, rebels, an opposition alliance of leaders [[Mahamat Nouri]], a former defense minister, and [[Timane Erdimi]], a nephew of [[Idriss Déby]] who was his chief of staff, attacked the Chadian capital of [[Ndjamena]] - even surrounding the Presidential Palace. But Idris Deby with government troops fought back. French forces flew in ammunition for Chadian government troops but took no active part in the fighting. UN has said that up to 20,000 people left the region, taking refuge in nearby [[Cameroon]] and [[Nigeria]]. Hundreds of people were killed, mostly civilians. The rebels accuse Deby of corruption and embezzling millions in oil revenue. While many Chadians may share that assessment, the uprising appears to be a power struggle within the elite that has long controlled [[Chad]]. The French government believes that the opposition has regrouped east of the capital. Déby has blamed [[Sudan]] for the current unrest in Chad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=  Chad's leader asserts he is control| date=February 6, 2008 | publisher=[[Associated Press|AP]] | url=http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080206/ap_on_re_af/chad }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== International orphanage scandal ===
Nearly 100 children at the center of an international scandal that left them stranded at an orphanage in remote eastern Chad returned home after nearly five months March 14, 2008. The 97 children were taken from their homes in October 2007 by a then-obscure French charity, [[Zoé's Ark]], which claimed they were orphans from [[Sudan]]'s [[War in Darfur|war-torn Darfur region]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=  Kidnapped Chadian kids reunited with their families| date=March 14, 2008 | publisher=[[CNN]] | url=http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/africa/03/14/chad.children/index.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{MapLibrary|Chad_sat.jpg|Chad}}
'''[[Chad]]''' is a land-locked country in north central [[Africa]] measuring {{convert|1284000|km2|sqmi|0|sp=us}}, roughly three times the size of [[California]]. Most of its ethnically and linguistically diverse population lives in the south, with densities ranging from 54 persons per square kilometers in the Logone River basin to 0.1 persons in the northern B.E.T. desert region, which is larger than France. The capital city of [[N'Djaména]], situated at the confluence of the [[Chari River|Chari]] and [[Logone River]]s, is cosmopolitan in nature, with a current population in excess of 700,000 people.

Chad has four bioclimatic zones. The northernmost Saharan zone averages less than {{convert|200|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} of rainfall annually. The sparse human population is largely nomadic, with some livestock, mostly small ruminants and camels. The central Sahelian zone receives between {{convert|200|and|600|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} rainfall and has vegetation ranging from grass/shrub [[steppe]] to thorny, open savanna. The southern zone, often referred to as the Sudanian zone, receives between {{convert|600|and|1000|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}, with woodland [[savanna]] and deciduous forests for vegetation. Rainfall in the Guinea zone, located in Chad's southwestern tip, ranges between {{convert|1000|and|1200|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}.

The country's topography is generally flat, with the elevation gradually rising as one moves north and east away from [[Lake Chad]]. The highest point in Chad is [[Emi Koussi]], a mountain that rises {{convert|3100|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} in the northern [[Tibesti Mountains]]. The [[Ennedi Plateau]] and the [[Ouaddaï highlands]] in the east complete the image of a gradually sloping basin, which descends towards Lake Chad. There are also central highlands in the Guera region rising to {{convert|1500|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}.

[[Lake Chad]] is the second largest lake in west Africa and is one of the most important wetlands on the continent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/6261447.stm BBC News - Lake Chad fishermen pack up their nets]&lt;/ref&gt; Home to 120 species of fish and at least that many species of birds, the lake has shrunk dramatically in the last four decades due to the increased water from an [[overpopulation|expanding population]] usage and low rainfall. Bordered by Chad, [[Niger]], [[Nigeria]], and [[Cameroon]], Lake Chad currently covers only 1350 square kilometers, down from 25,000 square kilometers in 1963. The Chari and Logone Rivers, both of which originate in the Central African Republic and flow northward, provide most of the surface water entering Lake Chad.

==Geographical setting==
[[Image:Chad nasa satellite.png|thumb|Satellite image of Chad]]
[[Image:Chad Topography.png|thumb|Topographic map of Chad]]
Located in north-central Africa, Chad stretches for about 1,800 kilometers from its northernmost point to its southern boundary. Except in the far northwest and south, where its borders converge, Chad's average width is about 800 kilometers. Its area of 1,284,000 square kilometers is roughly equal to the combined areas of [[Idaho]], [[Wyoming]], [[Utah]], [[Nevada]], and [[Arizona]]. Chad's neighbors include [[Libya]] to the north, [[Niger]] and [[Nigeria]] to the west, [[Sudan]] to the east, [[Central African Republic]] to the south, and [[Cameroon]] to the southwest.

Chad exhibits two striking geographical characteristics. First, the country is landlocked. [[N'Djamena]], the capital, is located more than 1,100 kilometers northeast of the [[Atlantic Ocean]]; [[Abéché]], a major city in the east, lies 2,650 kilometers from the [[Red Sea]]; and [[Faya-Largeau]], a much smaller but strategically important center in the north, is in the middle of the [[Sahara Desert]], 1,550 kilometers from the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. These vast distances from the sea have had a profound impact on Chad's historical and contemporary development. The second noteworthy characteristic is that the country borders on very different parts of the African continent: [[North Africa]], with its [[Islamic culture]] and economic orientation toward the [[Mediterranean Basin]]; [[West Africa]], with its diverse religions and cultures and its history of highly developed states and regional economies; [[Horn of Africa|Northeast Africa]], oriented toward the [[Nile|Nile Valley]] and Red Sea region; and Central or Equatorial Africa, some of whose people have retained classical African religions while others have adopted [[Christianity]], and whose economies were part of the great [[Congo River]] system. Although much of Chad's distinctiveness comes from this diversity of influences, since independence the diversity has also been an obstacle to the creation of a national identity.

==The Land==
Although Chadian society is economically, socially, and culturally fragmented, the country's geography is unified by the Lake Chad Basin. Once a huge inland sea (the Pale-Chadian Sea) whose only remnant is shallow Lake Chad, this vast depression extends west into Nigeria and Niger. The larger, northern portion of the basin is bounded within Chad by the Tibesti Mountains in the northwest, the Ennedi Plateau in the northeast, the Ouaddaï Highlands in the east along the border with Sudan, the Guéra Massif in central Chad, and the Mandara Mountains along Chad's southwestern border with Cameroon. The smaller, southern part of the basin falls almost exclusively in Chad. It is delimited in the north by the Guéra Massif, in the south by highlands 250 kilometers south of the border with Central African Republic, and in the southwest by the Mandara Mountains.

Lake Chad, located in the southwestern part of the basin at an altitude of 282 meters, surprisingly does not mark the basin's lowest point; instead, this is found in the [[Bodele]] and Djourab regions in the north-central and northeastern parts of the country, respectively. This oddity arises because the great stationary dunes (ergs) of the Kanem region create a dam, preventing lake waters from flowing to the basin's lowest point. At various times in the past, and as late as the 1870s, the Bahr el Ghazal Depression, which extends from the northeastern part of the lake to the Djourab, acted as an overflow canal; since independence, climatic conditions have made overflows impossible.

North and northeast of Lake Chad, the basin extends for more than 800 kilometers, passing through regions characterized by great rolling dunes separated by very deep depressions. Although vegetation holds the dunes in place in the Kanem region, farther north they are bare and have a fluid, rippling character. From its low point in the Djourab, the basin then rises to the plateaus and peaks of the Tibesti Mountains in the north. The summit of this formation—as well as the highest point in the Sahara Desert—is Emi Koussi, a dormant volcano that reaches 3,414 meters above sea level. 

The basin's northeastern limit is the Ennedi Plateau, whose limestone bed rises in steps etched by erosion. East of the lake, the basin rises gradually to the Ouaddaï Highlands, which mark Chad's eastern border and also divide the Chad and Nile watersheds. These highland areas are part of the [[East Saharan montane xeric woodlands]] [[ecoregion]].

Southeast of Lake Chad, the regular contours of the terrain are broken by the Guéra Massif, which divides the basin into its northern and southern parts. South of the lake lie the floodplains of the Chari and Logone rivers, much of which are inundated during the rainy season. Farther south, the basin floor slopes upward, forming a series of low sand and clay plateaus, called koros, which eventually climb to 615 meters above sea level. South of the Chadian border, the koros divide the Lake Chad Basin from the Ubangi-Zaire river system.

==Water systems==
Permanent streams do not exist in northern or central Chad. Following infrequent rains in the Ennedi Plateau and Ouaddaï Highlands, water may flow through depressions called enneris and wadis. Often the result of flash floods, such streams usually dry out within a few days as the remaining puddles seep into the sandy clay soil. The most important of these streams is the Batha, which in the rainy season carries water west from the Ouaddaï Highlands and the Guéra Massif to Lake Fitri.

[[Image:Chari River.jpg|thumb|240px|right|Chari River]]Chad's major rivers are the [[Chari River|Chari]] and the [[Logone River|Logone]] and their tributaries, which flow from the southeast into Lake Chad. Both river systems rise in the highlands of Central African Republic and Cameroon, regions that receive more than 1,250 millimeters of rainfall annually. Fed by rivers of Central African Republic, as well as by the Bahr Salamat, [[Bahr Aouk]], and Bahr Sara rivers of southeastern Chad, the Chari River is about 1,200 kilometers long. From its origins near the city of Sarh, the middle course of the Chari makes its way through swampy terrain; the lower Chari is joined by the Logone River near N'Djamena. The Chari's volume varies greatly, from 17 cubic meters per second during the dry season to 340 cubic meters per second during the wettest part of the year.

The Logone River is formed by tributaries flowing from Cameroon and Central African Republic. Both shorter and smaller in volume than the Chari, it flows northeast for 960 kilometers; its volume ranges from five to eighty-five cubic meters per second. At N'Djamena the Logone empties into the Chari, and the combined rivers flow together for thirty kilometers through a large delta and into Lake Chad. At the end of the rainy season in the fall, the river overflows its banks and creates a huge floodplain in the delta.

The seventh largest lake in the world (and the fourth largest in Africa), [[Lake Chad]] is located in the sahelian zone, a region just south of the Sahara Desert. The Chari River contributes 95 percent of Lake Chad's water, an average annual volume of 40 billion cubic meters, 95% of which is lost to evaporation. The size of the lake is determined by rains in the southern highlands bordering the basin and by temperatures in the Sahel. Fluctuations in both cause the lake to change dramatically in size, from 9,800 square kilometers in the dry season to 25,500 at the end of the rainy season. Lake Chad also changes greatly in size from one year to another. In 1870 its maximum area was 28,000 square kilometers. The measurement dropped to 12,700 in 1908. In the 1940s and 1950s, the lake remained small, but it grew again to 26,000 square kilometers in 1963. The droughts of the late 1960s, early 1970s, and mid-1980s caused Lake Chad to shrink once again, however. The only other lakes of importance in Chad are Lake Fitri, in Batha Prefecture, and Lake Iro, in the marshy southeast.

==Climate==
{{See also|Chad#Climate|l1=Climate}}
 
The Lake Chad Basin embraces a great range of tropical climates from north to south, although most of these climates tend to be dry. Apart from the far north, most regions are characterized by a cycle of alternating rainy and dry seasons. In any given year, the duration of each season is determined largely by the positions of two great air masses—a maritime mass over the Atlantic Ocean to the southwest and a much drier continental mass. During the rainy season, winds from the southwest push the moister maritime system north over the African continent where it meets and slips under the continental mass along a front called the &quot;intertropical convergence zone&quot;. At the height of the rainy season, the front may reach as far as Kanem Prefecture. By the middle of the dry season, the intertropical convergence zone moves south of Chad, taking the rain with it. This weather system contributes to the formation of three major regions of climate and vegetation.

===Saharan region===
[[Image:Sand strom Chad.jpg|thumb|240px|Sandstorm at Abéché airport, Chad (2005).]]The Saharan region covers roughly the northern third of the country, including Borkou-Ennedi-Tibesti Prefecture along with the northern parts of Kanem, Batha, and Biltine prefectures. Much of this area receives only traces of rain during the entire year; at Faya Largeau, for example, annual rainfall averages less than {{convert|30|mm|in|2|sp=us}}. Scattered small oases and occasional wells provide water for a few date palms or small plots of millet and garden crops. In much of the north, the average daily maximum temperature is about {{convert|32|°C|1}} during January, the coolest month of the year, and about {{convert|45|°C}} during May, the hottest month. On occasion, strong winds from the northeast produce violent sandstorms. In northern Biltine Prefecture, a region called the Mortcha plays a major role in animal husbandry. Dry for nine months of the year, it receives {{convert|350|mm|in|1|sp=us}} or more of rain, mostly during July and August. A carpet of green springs from the desert during this brief wet season, attracting herders from throughout the region who come to pasture their cattle and camels. Because very few wells and springs have water throughout the year, the herders leave with the end of the rains, turning over the land to the antelopes, gazelles, and ostriches that can survive with little groundwater.

===Sahelian region===
The semiarid sahelian zone, or Sahel, forms a belt about {{convert|500|km|mi|0|sp=us}} wide that runs from Lac and Chari-Baguirmi prefectures eastward through Guéra, Ouaddaï, and northern Salamat prefectures to the Sudanese frontier. The climate in this transition zone between the desert and the southern soudanian zone is divided into a rainy season (from June to early September) and a dry period (from October to May). In the northern Sahel, thorny shrubs and acacia trees grow wild, while date palms, cereals, and garden crops are raised in scattered oases. Outside these settlements, nomads tend their flocks during the rainy season, moving southward as forage and surface water disappear with the onset of the dry part of the year. The central Sahel is characterized by drought-resistant grasses and small woods. Rainfall is more abundant there than in the Saharan region. For example, N'Djamena records a maximum annual average rainfall of {{convert|580|mm|in|1|sp=us}}, while Ouaddaï Prefecture receives just a bit less. During the hot season, in April and May, maximum temperatures frequently rise above {{convert|40|°C}}. In the southern part of the Sahel, rainfall is sufficient to permit crop production on unirrigated land, and millet and sorghum are grown. Agriculture is also common in the marshlands east of Lake Chad and near swamps or wells. Many farmers in the region combine subsistence agriculture with the raising of cattle, sheep, goats, and poultry.

===Soudanian region===
The humid ''soudanian'' zone includes the southern prefectures of Mayo-Kebbi, Tandjilé, Logone Occidental, Logone Oriental, Moyen-Chari, and southern Salamat. Between April and October, the rainy season brings between {{convert|750|and|1250|mm|in|1|sp=us}} of precipitation. Temperatures are high throughout the year. Daytime readings in Moundou, the major city in the southwest, range from {{convert|27|°C|1}} in the middle of the cool season in January to about {{convert|40|°C}} in the hot months of March, April, and May.

The soudanian region is predominantly [[East Sudanian savanna]], or plains covered with a mixture of tropical or subtropical grasses and woodlands. The growth is lush during the rainy season but turns brown and dormant during the five-month dry season between November and March. Over a large part of the region, however, natural vegetation has yielded to agriculture.

===2010 drought===
{{Main|2010 Sahel drought}} 
On 22  June, the temperature reached {{convert|47.6|°C|°F}} in Faya, breaking a record set in 1961 at the same location. Similar temperature rises were also reported in [[Niger]], which began to enter a famine situation.&lt;ref name=&quot;MastersNOAA&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Masters|first=Jeff|title=NOAA: June 2010 the globe's 4th consecutive warmest month on record|url=http://www.wunderground.com/blog/JeffMasters/comment.html?entrynum=1544|work=Weather Underground|publisher=Jeff Masters' WunderBlog|accessdate=21 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Chad-demography.png|thumb|right|Demographics of Chad, Data of [[Food and Agriculture Organization|FAO]], year 2005 ; Number of inhabitants in thousands.]]
The people of [[Chad]] speak more than 100 different languages and divide themselves into many ethnic groups. However, language and ethnicity are not the same. Moreover, neither element can be tied to a particular physical type. In Chad, [[Europe]]an conquest and administration intensified feelings of ethnic separateness by drawing local boundaries along perceived ethnic lines. The Europeans also appointed chiefs and other local African authorities who had little legitimacy over the groups they were to lead. In general, the [[France|French]] favored southerners over northerners and settled populations over nomads. This bias continued after independence and has been an important element in internecine conflict. 

Although the possession of a common language shows that its speakers have lived together and have a common history, peoples also change languages. This is particularly so in Chad, where the openness of the terrain, marginal rainfall, frequent drought and famine, and low population densities have encouraged physical and linguistic mobility. Slave raids among non-Muslim peoples, internal slave trade, and exports of captives northward from the ninth to the twentieth centuries also have resulted in language changes. 

Anthropologists view ethnicity as being more than genetics. Like language, ethnicity implies a shared heritage, partly economic, where people of the same ethnic group may share a livelihood, and partly social, taking the form of shared ways of doing things and organizing relations among individuals and groups. Ethnicity also involves a cultural component made up of shared values and a common worldview. Like language, ethnicity is not immutable. Shared ways of doing things change over time and alter a group's perception of its own identity. 

Not only do the social aspects of ethnic identity change but the biological composition (or gene pool) also may change over time. Although most ethnic groups emphasize intermarriage, people are often proscribed from seeking partners among close relatives -- a prohibition that promotes biological variation. In all groups, the departure of some individuals or groups and the integration of others also changes the biological component. 

The Chadian government has avoided official recognition of ethnicity. With the exception of a few surveys conducted shortly after independence, little data were available on this important aspect of Chadian society. Nonetheless, ethnic identity was a significant component of life in Chad. 

Chad's languages fall into ten major groups, each of which belongs to either the 
[[Nilo-Saharan]], [[Afro-Asiatic]], or [[Congo-Kordofanian]] language family. These represent three of the four major language families in Africa; only the [[Khoisan]] languages of southern Africa are not represented. The presence of such different languages suggests that the [[Lake Chad]] Basin may have been an important point of dispersal in ancient times.

==Religions==
{{main|Religion in Chad}}
The separation of religion from social structure in Chad represents a false dichotomy, for they are perceived as two sides of the same coin. Three religious traditions coexist in Chad-- classical African religions, [[Islam]] (see [[Islam in Chad]]), and [[Christianity]]. None is monolithic. The first tradition includes a variety of ancestor and/or place-oriented religions whose expression is highly specific. Islam, although characterized by an orthodox set of beliefs and observances, also is expressed in diverse ways. Christianity arrived in Chad much more recently with the arrival of Europeans. Its followers are divided into Roman Catholics and Protestants (including several denominations); as with Chadian Islam, Chadian Christianity retains aspects of pre-Christian religious belief. 

The number of followers of each tradition in Chad is unknown. Estimates made in 1962 suggested that 35 percent of Chadians practiced classical African religions, 55 percent were [[Islam|Muslims]], and 10 percent were [[Christianity|Christians]]. In the 1970s and 1980s, this distribution undoubtedly changed. Observers report that Islam has spread among the [[Hajerai]] and among other non-Muslim populations of the Saharan and sahelian zones. However, the proportion of Muslims may have fallen because the birthrate among the followers of traditional religions and Christians in southern Chad is thought to be higher than that among Muslims. In addition, the upheavals since the mid-1970s have resulted in the departure of some missionaries; whether or not Chadian Christians have been numerous enough and organized enough to have attracted more converts since that time is unknown.

{{Politics of Chad}}
'''Politics of Chad''' takes place in a framework of a [[presidential system|presidential]] [[republic]], whereby the [[President of Chad]] is both [[head of state]] and [[head of government]]. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the [[government]] and parliament. [[Chad]] is one of the [[Corruption Perceptions Index|most corrupt countries]] in the world.

==Executive branch==

A strong executive branch headed by President [[Idriss Déby]] dominates the [[Chad]]ian political system. Following his military overthrow of [[Hissène Habré]] in December 1990, Déby won presidential elections in 1996 and 2001. The constitutional basis for the government is the 1996 constitution, under which the president was limited to two terms of office until Déby had that provision repealed in 2005. The president has the power to appoint the prime minister and the Council of State (or cabinet), and exercises considerable influence over appointments of judges, generals, provincial officials and heads of Chad’s parastatal firms. In cases of grave and immediate threat, the president, in consultation with the National Assembly President and Council of State, may declare a state of emergency. Most of the Déby's key advisors are members of the [[Zaghawa people|Zaghawa]] clan, although some southern and opposition personalities are represented in his government.

==Legislative branch==
According to the 1996 constitution, the [[National Assembly of Chad|National Assembly]] deputies are elected by universal suffrage for 4-year terms. Parliamentary elections are scheduled for spring 2002. The Assembly holds regular sessions twice a year, starting in March and October, and can hold special sessions as necessary and called by the prime minister. Deputies elect a president of the National Assembly every 2 years. Assembly deputies or members of the executive branch may introduce legislation; once passed by the Assembly, the president must take action to either sign or reject the law within 15 days. The National Assembly must approve the prime minister’s plan of government and may force the prime minister to resign through a majority vote of no-confidence. However, if the National Assembly rejects the executive branch’s program twice in one year, the president may disband the Assembly and call for new legislative elections. In practice, the president exercises considerable influence over the National Assembly through the MPS party structure.

==Judicial branch==
Despite the constitution’s guarantee of judicial independence from the executive branch, the president names most key judicial officials. The Supreme Court is made up of a chief justice, named by the president, and 15 councilors chosen by the president and National Assembly; appointments are for life. The Constitutional Council, with nine judges elected to 9-year terms, has the power to review all legislation, treaties and international agreements prior to their adoption. The constitution recognizes customary and traditional law in locales where it is recognized and to the extent it does not interfere with public order or constitutional guarantees of equality for all citizens.

Landlocked '''[[Chad]]''''s economic development suffers from its geographic remoteness, drought, lack of infrastructure, and political turmoil. About 85% of the population depends on [[agriculture]], including the herding of [[livestock]]. Of Africa's Francophone countries, Chad benefited least from the 50% devaluation of their currencies in January 1994. Financial aid from the [[World Bank]], the [[African Development Bank]], and other sources is directed largely at the improvement of agriculture, especially livestock production. Because of lack of financing, the development of [[oil field]]s near [[Doba]], originally due to finish in 2000, was delayed until 2003. It was finally developed and is now operated by Exxon Mobil Corporation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ersdac.or.jp/todayData/038/pict_e.html Doba Oil Field&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Economic statistics]] for Chad must be treated with caution. Significant trade with neighbouring countries, for example, exports of [[camel]]s and other livestock to neighbouring states, such as [[Libya]], and imports of [[manufactured goods]], are conducted &quot;informally&quot; and probably not fully recorded.

[http://earthtrends.wri.org/text/economics-business/variable-638.html Current GDP per capita] of Chad grew 23% in the Sixties reaching a peak growth of 80% in the Seventies. But this proved unsustainable and growth consequently scaled back to 30% in the Eighties. Finally, it shrank by 40% in the Nineties.

Mean wages were $0.68 per manhour in 2009.

==Structure and sectors==

In 2000, Chad's nominal [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] was estimated at just over $1.43 billion with [[per capita income]] at approximately $188. Oil production started in 2003; by 2008, oil accounted for 47 percent of GDP and oil revenues had risen to 41 percent of GDP. Economic growth has been subdued in 2007 and 2008, with a ¼ percent growth in real GDP in 2007 due to weak non-oil growth, marked by weak agricultural production, and a sharp decline in oil production owing to technical problems in several fields. Real GDP in 2008 is expected to decline by ½ percent because of a further drop in oil production and the impact of the 2008 February rebel attack on economic activity over the first half of the year. Positive growth rates are not expected until 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfw4a.org/chad/chad-financial-sector-profile.html MFW4A]&lt;/ref&gt; Cotton, cattle and gum arabic are Chad’s major exports. More than 80% of the work force is involved in agriculture (subsistence farming, herding, and fishing). Like many other developing countries, Chad has a small formal sector and a large, thriving informal sector. Government statistics indicate the following distribution: Agriculture—38% (farming—23%, livestock—12%, fishing—3%); industry—13%; and services—45%. Chad is highly dependent on foreign assistance. Its principal donors include the European Union, France, and the multilateral lending agencies.

==Exports==
[[Image:2006Chadian exports.PNG|thumb|240px|left|Chadian exports in 2006]]Primary markets for Chadian exports include neighboring Cameroon and Nigeria and France, Germany, and Portugal. Until [[crude oil]] production began in 2003, [[cotton]] played the dominant role, accounting for 40% of total exports in 1999 and remains important. Rehabilitation of [[Cotontchad]], the major cotton company that suffered from a decline in world cotton prices, has been financed by [[France]], the [[Netherlands]], the [[European Economic Community]] (EC), and the [[International Bank for Reconstruction and Development]] (IBRD). As of January 2002, the [[parastatal]] was undergoing [[privatization]].

The other major export is livestock, herded to neighboring countries. Herdsmen in the Sudanic and Sahelian zones raise [[cattle]], [[sheep]], [[goat]]s, and, among the non-Muslims, a few [[pig]]s. In the Saharan region, only camels and a few hardy goats can survive. Chad also sells [[smoked fish|smoked]] and [[dried fish]] to its neighbors and exports several million dollars worth of [[gum arabic]] to Europe and the U.S. each year. Other food crops include [[pearl millet]], [[sorghum]], [[peanut]]s, [[rice]], [[sweet potatoes]], [[manioc]], [[cassava]], and [[Yam (vegetable)|yam]]s.

==Instability and uncertainty==
[[Image:Abeche market.jpg|thumb|240px|left|Local market in [[Abeche]]]]Chad’s economic performance continues to depend on fluctuations in [[rainfall]] and in prices of its principal export commodities, especially cotton. Between 1996 and 1998, the Chadian economy averaged 4.7% growth from. However, unfavorable weather conditions contributed to disappointing harvests in 1999-2000, and GDP grew only by 1% and 0.6% respectively. Inflation was estimated 3.7% in 2000 after prices fell by 8% in 1999.

The effects on foreign investment of years of civil war are still felt today, as investors who left Chad between 1979-82 have only recently begun to regain confidence in the country's future. By early 1983, the return of internal security and a successful Geneva donors' conference had prompted a number of international business representatives to make exploratory visits to Chad. By far the most important venture to date is the [[oil extraction]] project in southern Chad.

As of 2004 the economy of Chad has been subjected to further pressure due to fleeing [[refugees]] from the conflict in the neighbouring [[Darfur]] region of [[Sudan]].

==Oil production==
[[Image:Chad-Logone Oriental region.png|thumb|left|180px|The Doba oil field, located in southern Chad, offers substantial promise of foreign income.]]
Beginning in late 2000, the Doba Basin oil project has stimulated major investments into Chad and it is expected to double government tax revenues by 2004. It is hoped that this project will serve as a catalyst for the entire economy by helping to reduce energy costs and attract additional trade and investment in other sectors. The question remains whether Chad will continue to consolidate its economic reforms and invest its oil revenues wisely in order to encourage a wider range of economic initiatives. Recent political controversy surrounding the contested 2001 presidential election and a continuing rebellion in northern Chad have continued to dampen Chad's economic prospects by exposing the weaknesses in Chad's political institutions.

The [[International Monetary Fund]] has projected high growth rates during the next 3 years, as the Doba basin oil project in southern Chad accelerates. The [[Exxon Mobil]]-led project will pump oil from reserves in Chad through an underground pipeline to coastal Cameroon, where it will be loaded onto tankers. Following a crucial World Bank financing decision in June 2000, the Doba project officially began its construction phase in October 2000. Between 2000 and 2003, an American-led consortium invested $3.7 billion into the project, approximately $2 billion of which was invested in Chad. By the year 2003-04 the consortium planned to produce between 150,000 to 250,000 barrels of oil a day from three fields in southern Chad. The project is expected to provide between $80 and $100 million in annual government revenues during the 25-year production phase. However, despite this economic growth, some environmentalists and African NGOs fear that the project will lead to grave environmental damage and the dominance of the Chadian economy by foreign powers.

==Diversification==
In 2007, cotton and hydrocarbon industries accounted for well over 95% of the Chadian economy. Diversification of the economy into manufacturing industries remain a long-term issue.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Transport infrastructure within [[Chad]]''' is generally poor, especially in the north and east of the country.  There are no railways and river transport is limited to the south-west corner.

Roads are mostly unsurfaced and are likely to be impassable during the [[wet season]], especially in the southern half of the country.  In the north, roads are merely tracks across the [[desert]] and [[land mines]] continue to present a danger.  Draft animals ([[horse]]s, [[donkey]]s and [[camel]]s) remain important in much of the country.

Fuel supplies can be erratic, even in the south-west of the country, and are expensive.  Elsewhere they are practically non-existent.

== Railways ==

Chad has no railways, but Libya is contemplating extending its naiscent railway network to sub-Saharan Africa, perhaps via Chad on its way to other countries.  This link would be standard gauge ({{railgauge|1435}}). &lt;ref&gt; http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0BQQ/is_1_41/ai_69709357 &lt;/ref&gt;

== Highways ==
''total:''
33,400&amp;nbsp;km

''paved:''
Approximately 500&amp;nbsp;km.  Some, but not all of the roads in N'Djamena are paved.  The country has one paved road outside of N'Djamena, which runs from Massakory in the north, through N'Djamena and then south, through the cities of Guelendeng, Bongor, Kelo and Moundou, with a short spur leading in the direction of Kousseri, Cameroon, near N'Djamena.  Expansion of the road towards Cameroon via Pala and Lere is reportedly in the preparatory stages.
&lt;br&gt;''unpaved:''
33,133&amp;nbsp;km (1999 est.)

== Waterways ==
Most rivers flow but intermittently. On the [[Chari River|Chari]], between N’Djamena and [[Lake Chad]], transportation is possible all year round. In September and October, the [[Logone River|Logone]] is navigable between N’Djamena and [[Moundou]], and the [[Shari]] between N’Djamena and Sarh. Total waterways cover 4,800 km (3,000 mi), of which 2,000 km (1,250 mi) are navigable all year.

&lt;br&gt;''note'': Chari and Logone Rivers are navigable only in wet season (2002).  Both flow northwards, from the south of Chad, into [[Lake Chad]].

==Pipelines==
Since 2003, a 1,070&amp;nbsp;km pipeline has been used to export [[crude oil]] from the [[oilfield]]s around [[Doba]] to offshore oil-loading facilities on [[Cameroon]]'s [[Atlantic ocean|Atlantic]] coast at {{flagicon|Cameroon}} [[Kribi]]. [http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/AFRICAEXT/EXTREGINI/EXTCHADCAMPIPELINE/0,,contentMDK:20516071~menuPK:843292~pagePK:64168445~piPK:64168309~theSitePK:843238,00.html]

== Seaports and harbors ==
None ([[landlocked]])

Chad's main routes to the sea are:-

* From [[N'Djamena]] and the south west of Chad:
** By road to [[Ngaoundéré]], in Cameroon, and then by rail to [[Douala]]
** By road to [[Maiduguri]], in [[Nigeria]], and then by rail to [[Port Harcourt]]
* From the north and east of Chad:
** By road across the [[Sahara]] desert to [[Libya]]

In colonial times, the main access was by road to [[Bangui]], in the [[Central African Republic]], then by river boat to [[Brazzaville]], and onwards by rail from Brazzaville to [[Pointe Noire]], on [[Republic of Congo|Congo's]] [[Atlantic]] coast. This route is now little used.

There is also a route across [[Sudan]], to the [[Red Sea]], but very little trade goes this way.

Links with [[Niger]], north of Lake Chad, are practically nonexistent; it is easier to reach Niger via Cameroon and Nigeria.

== Airports ==
Chad had an estimated 50 airports in 2004, only 7 of which had paved runways as of 2005. [[Air Tchad]] (60 percent state owned) provides internal service to 12 locations but suffers from lack of fuel and equipment. The international airport at N’Djamena was damaged in fighting in 1981, but is now served by several international carriers including [[Air Afrique]], which is partly owned by Chad. Another major airport, developed as a military staging area, is located at [[Sarh]]. In 2003, scheduled airlines in Chad carried about 46,000 passengers on domestic and international flights.

The '''[[Military]] of [[Chad]]''' consists of the Armed Forces (includes Ground Force, [[Chad Air Force|Air Force]], and Gendarmerie), Republican Guard, Rapid Intervention Force, [[Police]], and [[National and Nomadic Guard]] (GNNT). Currently the main task of the Chadian military is to combat the various rebel forces inside the country.

==History==
{{More footnotes|section|date=September 2009}}
{{Main|History of the military of Chad}}
[[File:Chadian soldiers in Toyota pickup truck.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Chadian soldiers in a Technical]]
From independence through the period of the presidency of Félix Malloum (1975–79), the official national army was known as the [[Chadian Armed Forces]] (Forces Armées Tchadiennes—FAT). Composed mainly of soldiers from southern Chad, FAT had its roots in the army recruited by France and had military traditions dating back to World War I. FAT lost its status as the legal state army when Malloum's civil and military administration disintegrated in 1979. Although it remained a distinct military body for several years, FAT was eventually reduced to the status of a regional army representing the south.

After Habré consolidated his authority and assumed the presidency in 1982, his victorious army, the Armed Forces of the North (Forces Armées du Nord—FAN), became the nucleus of a new national army. The force was officially constituted in January 1983, when the various pro-Habré contingents were merged and renamed FANT.

The Military of Chad was dominated by members of [[Toubou]], [[Zaghawa people|Zaghawa]], [[Kanembou]], [[Hadjerai]], and [[Massa (African ethnic group)|Massa]] ethnic groups during the presidency of [[Hissène Habré]]. Current [[Chad]]ian president [[Idriss Déby]], revolted and fled to the [[Sudan]], taking with him many Zaghawa and Hadjerai soldiers in 1989.

Chad's armed forces numbered about 36,000 at the end of the Habré regime, but swelled to an estimated 50,000 in the early days of Déby's rule. With [[France|French]] support, a reorganization of the armed forces was initiated early in 1991 with the goal of reducing its numbers and making its ethnic composition reflective of the country as a whole. Neither of these goals was achieved, and the military is still dominated by the Zaghawa.

In 2004, the government discovered that many of the soldiers it was paying did not exist and that there were only about 19,000 soldiers in the army, as opposed to the 24,000 that had been previously believed. Government crackdowns against the practice are thought to have been a factor in a failed military mutiny in May 2004.

The current conflict, in which the Chadian military is involved, is the civil war against Sudanese-backed rebels. Chad successfully manages to repel the rebel movements, but recently, with some losses (see [[Battle of N'Djamena (2008)]]). The army uses its [[artillery]] systems and tanks, but well-equipped insurgents have probably managed to destroy over 20 of Chad's 60 tanks, and probably shot down a [[Mi-24 Hind]] [[gunship]], which has bombed enemy positions near the border with [[Sudan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://africa.reuters.com/top/news/usnBAN032261.html Reuters - Rebels down a Chadian gunship]&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2006 [[Libya]] supplied Chad with four [[Aermacchi SF.260]]W light attack planes. They are used to strike enemy positions by the Chadian Air Force, but one has been shot down by rebels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.siai-marchetti.nl/sf260mil.html siai-marchetti.nl - SF.260 military customers]&lt;/ref&gt; During the last battle of [[N'Djamena]] gunships and tanks have been put to good use, pushing armed militia forces back from the Presidential palace.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.voanews.com/english/archive/2008-02/2008-02-03-voa4.cfm?CFID=13686609&amp;CFTOKEN=56670733 Chadian Army Helicopters, Tanks Battle Rebels Besieging Presidential Palace]&lt;/ref&gt; The battle impacted the highest levels of the army leadership, as [[Daoud Soumain]], its [[Chief of Army Staff|Chief of Staff]], was killed.&lt;ref&gt;[[Radio Netherlands Worldwide]]: [http://www.radionetherlands.nl/news/international/5627058/Chad-rebels-kill-army-chief-of-staff  Chad rebels kill army chief of staff]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spending==
The CIA World Factbook estimates the military budget of Chad to be 4,2% of GDP as of 2006.[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/cd.html]. Given the current GDP ($7.095 bln) of the country, military spending is roughly estimated to be $297,990,000.

{{Politics of Chad}}
The '''Foreign relations of Chad''' are motivated primarily by the desire for outside investment in [[Chad]]ian industry and support for [[Chadian President]] [[Idriss Déby]]. Chad is officially non-aligned but has close relations with [[France]], the former colonial power. Relations with neighbouring [[Libya]], and [[Sudan]] vary periodically. Lately, the Idris Déby regime has been waging an intermittent [[proxy war]] with Sudan. Aside from those two countries, Chad generally enjoys good relations with its neighbouring states.

==Relations with other African and Arab states==
Although relations with Libya improved with the presidency of [[Idriss Déby]], strains persist. Chad has been an active champion of regional cooperation through the Central African Economic and Customs Union, the Lake Chad and Niger River Basin Commissions, and the Interstate Commission for the Fight Against the Drought in the Sahel.

Delimitation of international boundaries in the vicinity of [[Lake Chad]], the lack of which led to border incidents in the past, has been completed and awaits ratification by [[Cameroon]], [[Chad]], [[Niger]], and [[Nigeria]].

Despite centuries-old cultural ties to the [[Arab World]], the Chadian Government maintained few significant ties Arab states in North Africa or Southwest Asia in the 1980s. However, Chad has not recognised the State of [[Israel]] since former [[Chadian President]] [[François (Ngarta) Tombalbaye]] broke off relations in September 1972 as an act of solidarity with the Palestinians, and other Arabs under Israeli occupation. President Habré hoped to pursue closer relations with Arab states as a potential opportunity to break out of his Chad's post-imperial dependence on France, and to assert Chad's unwillingness to serve as an arena for superpower rivalries. In addition, as a northern Christian, Habré represented a constituency that favored co-operation and solidarity with Arabs, both African, and Asian. For these reasons, he was expected to seize opportunities during the 1990s to pursue closer ties with the Arab World. In 1988, Chad recognized the [[State of Palestine]], which maintains a mission in N'Djamena.

During the 1980s, Arab opinion on the Chadian-Libyan conflict over the Aozou Strip was divided. Several Arab states supported Libyan territorial claims to the Strip, among the most outspoken of which was Algeria, which provided training for anti-Habré forces, although most recruits for its training programs were from Nigeria or Cameroon, recruited and flown to Algeria by Libya. Lebanon's Progressive Socialist Party also sent troops to support Qadhafi's efforts against Chad in 1987. In contrast, numerous other Arab states opposed the Libyan actions, and expressed their desire to see the dispute over the Aozou Strip settled peacefully. By the end of 1987, Algiers and N'Djamena were negotiating to improve relations.

===Sudan===
{{main|Chad-Sudan relations}}
{{main|Battle of Amdjereme}}
On December 24, 2005, Chad declared itself as in a &quot;state of belligerance&quot; with neighboring Sudan. The conflict in the border region of Darfur has become an increasingly bi-national affair as increasing numbers of Sudanese flee to refugee camps in Chad, and Sudanese government troops and militias cross the borders to strike at both these camps and specific ethnic groups. Although the [[Government of Chad]] and the [[Government of Sudan]] signed the [[Tripoli Agreement]] on February 8, 2006, officially ending hostilities, fighting continues. On 11 August 2006, Chad and Sudan resumed relations at the behest of Libyan president [[Muammar al-Gaddafi]]. &lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4775111.stm&lt;/ref&gt;

Chad broke diplomatic relations with [[Sudan]] at least twice in 2006 because it believed the [[Sudanese government]] was supporting [[Janjaweed]] and [[UFDC]] rebels financially and with arms. Two accords were signed, the [[Tripoli Accord]], which was signed on February 8 and failed to end the fighting, and the more recently signed [[N'Djamena Agreement]]. On May 11, 2008 Sudan announced it was cutting diplomatic relations with Chad, claiming that it was helping rebels in [[Darfur]] to attack the Sudanese capital [[Khartoum]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/7394422.stm Sudan cuts Chad ties over attack]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Libya===
{{main|Chad-Libya relations}}

Chadian-Libyan relations were ameliorated when Libyan-supported [[Idriss Déby]] unseated Habré on December 2. Gaddafi was the first head of state to recognize the new regime, and he also signed treaties of friendship and cooperation on various levels; but regarding the Aouzou Strip Déby followed his predecessor, declaring that if necessary he would fight to keep the strip out of Libya's hands.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Chad The Devil Behind the Scenes| newspaper =[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|year= |date=1990-12-17|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,971950,00.html?iid=chix-sphere|postscript=&lt;!--none--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Azevedo, p. 150&lt;/ref&gt;

The Aouzou dispute was concluded for good on February 3, 1994, when the judges of the ICJ by a majority of 16 to 1 decided that the Aouzou Strip belonged to Chad. The court's judgement was implemented without delay, the two parties signing as early as April 4 an agreement concerning the practical modalities for the implementation of the judgement. Monitored by international observers, the withdrawal of Libyan troops from the Strip began on April 15 and was completed by May 10. The formal and final transfer of the Strip from Libya to Chad took place on May 30, when the sides signed a joint declaration stating that the Libyan withdrawal had been effected.&lt;ref&gt;G. Simons, p. 78&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nigeria===
{{main|Chad-Nigeria relations}}

Nigeria's 1983 economic austerity campaign produced strains with neighboring states, including Chad. Nigeria expelled several hundred thousand foreign workers, mostly from its oil industry, which faced drastic cuts as a result of declining world oil prices. At least 30,000 of those expelled were Chadians. Despite these strains, however, Nigerians had assisted in the halting process of achieving stability in Chad, and both nations reaffirmed their intention to maintain close ties.

==Relations with Western countries==
Chad is officially non-aligned but has close relations with [[France]], the former colonial power, which has about 1,200 troops stationed in the capital [[N'Djamena]]. It receives economic aid from countries of the European Community, the [[United States]], and various international organizations. [[Libya]] supplies aid and has an [[ambassador]] resident in [[N'Djamena]]. Traditionally strong ties with the [[Western world|Western]] community have weakened over the past two years due to a dispute between the [[Government of Chad]] and the [[World Bank]] over how the profits from Chad's [[petroleum]] reserves are allocated. Although oil output to the West has resumed and the dispute has officially been resolved, resentment towards, what the Déby administration considered, foreign meddling lingers.

===France===
{{main|Chad-France relations}}

[[France]] was [[Chad]]'s most important [[foreign aid|foreign donor]] and patron for the first three decades following [[Decolonization_in_Chad#French_federation_versus_full_independence|independence]] in 1960. At the end of the 1980s, economic ties were still strong, and France provided development assistance in the form of loans and grants. It was no longer Chad's leading customer for [[Agriculture in Chad|agricultural exports]], but it continued to provide substantial military support.

Chad remained a member of the [[African Financial Community]] (Communauté Financière Africaine—CFA), which linked the value of its currency, the [[CFA franc]], to the [[French franc]]. French private and government investors owned a substantial portion of Chad's industrial and financial institutions, and the French treasury backed the [[Bank of Central African States]] (Banque des Etats de l'Afrique Centrale—BEAC), which served as the central bank for Chad and six other member nations. Chad's dependence on France declined slightly during [[Habré]]'s tenure as president, in part because other foreign donors and investors returned as the war subsided and also because increased rainfall since 1985 improved food production. French official attitudes toward Chad had changed from the 1970s policies under the leadership of [[Giscard d'Estaing]] to those of the [[Mitterrand]] era of the 1980s. Economic, political, and strategic goals, which had emphasized maintaining French influence in Africa, exploiting Chad's natural resources, and bolstering [[francophone Africa]]'s status as a bulwark against the spread of [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] influence, had been replaced by nominally [[anticolonialist]] attitudes. The [[French legislative election, 1981|election]] in France of the [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist]] government in 1981 had coincided with [[History_of_Chad#The_Habr.C3.A9_era_.281982.E2.80.9390.29|conditions of near-anarchy in Chad]], leading France's Socialist Party to reaffirm its ideological stance against high-profile intervention in Africa. Hoping to avoid a confrontation with [[Libya]], another important client state in the region, President Mitterrand limited French military involvement to a defense of the region surrounding [[N'Djamena]] in 1983 and 1984. Then, gradually increasing its commitment to reinforce Habré's presidency, France once again increased its military activity in Chad.

===United States===
{{main|Chad-United States relations}}

The American embassy in [[N'Djamena]], established at Chadian independence in 1960, was closed from the onset of the heavy fighting in the city in 1980 until the withdrawal of the [[Libya]]n forces at the end of 1981. It was reopened in January 1982. The [[U.S. Agency for International Development]] (USAID) and the [[U.S. Information Service]] (USIS) offices resumed activities in Chad in September 1983. The United States Department of State issued a travel advisory to U.S. citizens in 2009, recommending that citizens not affiliated with humanitarian efforts avoid all travel to eastern Chad and the Chad/[[Central African Republic]] border area due to insecurity caused by banditry, recent clashes between Chadian government and rebel forces, and political tension between Chad and [[Sudan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;USStateWarning&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/tw/tw_2876.html | title = Travel Warning - Chad | publisher = U.S. Department of State Bureau of Consular Affairs | date = June 2, 2009 | accessdate = August 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Romania===
{{main|Chad–Romania relations}}

Chad–Romania relations were established on 15 July 1969. However, neither country has an embassy in the other's capital, and although an agreement on trade was signed in 1969, followed by an agreement on economic and technical cooperation in 1971, {{Asof|2007|lc=on}}, the volume of bilateral trade remained insignificant.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.mae.ro/index.php?unde=doc&amp;id=5530|publisher=Minister of Foreign Affairs|publication-place=Romania|month=May|year=2008|accessdate=2009-03-26|title=Republica CIAD|postscript=&lt;!--none--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2007, Romania announced that they would deploy 120 troops to Chad and the [[Central African Republic]] in connection with [[United Nations Mission in the Central African Republic and Chad|a European Union peacekeeping mission]] there.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Romanian prime minister approves mission to Chad|date=2008-01-30|accessdate=2009-03-26|url=http://www.eubusiness.com/news-eu/1201722422.02/|agency=AFP|periodical=EUBusiness.com|postscript=&lt;!--none--&gt;}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Romania continued to condemn violence in Chad and blamed it on rebel groups.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC&quot;&gt;{{citation|title=Romanian Foreign Ministry concerned about developments in Chad|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=NewsLibrary&amp;p_multi=BBAB&amp;d_place=BBAB&amp;p_theme=newslibrary2&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=11EA69384BEB0298&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM|date=2008-02-05|accessdate=2009-03-26|periodical=BBC News|postscript=&lt;!--none--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, by mid-2008, Romanian defence minister [[Teodor Meleşcanu]] indicated that his country would not send further troops to the mission in Chad, stating that they had reached their limits and did not want involvement in a war theatre.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Romania not sending troops to 2009 EU Chad mission|periodical=BBC News|date=2008-07-01|accessdate=2009-03-26|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=NewsLibrary&amp;p_multi=BBAB&amp;d_place=BBAB&amp;p_theme=newslibrary2&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=121A8477A1DEFD70&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM|postscript=&lt;!--none--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relations with Asian countries==
Chad and the [[Republic of China]] (Taiwan) had [[foreign relations of the Republic of China|relations]] from 1962 to 1972 and 1997 to 2006 when, for financial and security reasons, Chad announced its intention to recognize the [[People's Republic of China]]. Taiwan broke off relations with Chad on August 5, 2006 (hours before a scheduled official visit by Premier [[Su Tseng-chang]]) and Chad formally recognized the PRC on August 6.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cna.com.tw/eng/topread.php?id=200608060023&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Milk.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Milk]] is an [[emulsion|emulsified]] colloid of liquid [[butterfat]] globules dispersed within a [[water]]-based liquid.]]
A '''colloid''' is a substance microscopically dispersed evenly throughout another substance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
|publisher = Britannica Online Encyclopedia|url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/125898/colloid 
|title=Colloid|accessdate = 2009-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A colloidal system consists of two separate phases: a ''dispersed phase'' (or ''internal phase'') and a ''continuous phase'' (or ''dispersion medium''). A colloidal system may be [[solid]], [[liquid]], or [[gas]]eous. 

Many familiar substances are colloids, as shown in the [[Colloid#Classification of colloids|chart]] below. In addition to these naturally occurring colloids, modern chemical process industries utilize [[High shear mixer|high shear mixing technology]] to create novel colloids.

The dispersed-phase particles have a diameter of between approximately 5 and 200 [[nanometre|nanometers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Levine|first=Ira N.|coauthors=|authorlink=|title=Physical Chemistry|edition=5th|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=Boston|year=2001|isbn=0-07-231808-2|series=}}, p. 955&lt;/ref&gt; Such particles are normally invisible in an optical [[microscope]], though their presence can be confirmed with the use of an [[ultramicroscope]] or an [[electron microscope]]. [[Homogeneous (chemistry)|Homogeneous]] mixtures with a dispersed phase in this size range may be called ''colloidal aerosols'', ''colloidal emulsions'', ''colloidal foams'', ''colloidal dispersions'', or ''hydrosols''. The dispersed-phase particles or droplets are affected largely by the [[surface science|surface chemistry]] present in the colloid.

Some colloids are translucent because of the [[Tyndall effect]], which is the scattering of light by particles in the colloid. Other colloids may be opaque or have a slight color.

Colloidal solutions (also called colloidal solutions or colloidal suspensions) are the subject of [[interface and colloid science]]. This field of study was introduced in 1861 by [[Scotland|Scottish]] scientist [[Thomas Graham (chemist)|Thomas Graham]].

==Classification of colloids==
Because the size of the dispersed phase may be difficult to measure, and because colloids have the appearance of [[solution]]s, colloids are sometimes identified and characterized by their physico-chemical and transport properties. For example, if a colloid consists of a solid phase dispersed in a liquid, the solid particles will not [[Molecular diffusion|diffuse]] through a membrane, whereas with a true solution the dissolved ions or molecules will diffuse through a membrane. Because of the size exclusion, the colloidal particles are unable to pass through the pores of an ultrafiltration membrane with a size smaller than their own dimension. The smaller the size of the pore of the ultrafiltration membrane, the lower the concentration of the dispersed colloidal particules remaining in the ultrafiltred liquid. The exact value of the concentration of a truly dissolved species will thus depend on the experimental conditions applied to separate it from the colloidal particles also dispersed in the liquid. This is, a.o., particularly important for [[solubility]] studies of readily [[hydrolysed]] species such as Al, Eu, Am, Cm, ... or [[organic matter]] [[complexation|complexing]] these species. 

Colloids can be classified as follows:
&lt;table class=&quot;wikitable&quot;&gt;

 &lt;td&gt;&lt;center&gt;'''Solid aerosol'''&lt;br /&gt;Examples: [[smoke]], [[cloud]], [[particulate|air particulates]]
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;Liquid&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;center&gt;'''[[Foam]]'''&lt;br /&gt;Example: [[whipped cream]], [[Shaving cream]]&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;center&gt;'''[[Emulsion]]'''&lt;br /&gt;Examples: [[milk]], [[mayonnaise]], [[soap|hand cream]]&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;center&gt;'''[[Sol (colloid)|Sol]]'''&lt;br /&gt;Examples: [[ink|pigmented ink]], [[blood]]&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;Solid&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;center&gt;'''Solid foam'''&lt;br /&gt;Examples: [[aerogel]], [[styrofoam]], [[pumice]]&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;center&gt;'''[[Gel]]'''&lt;br /&gt;Examples: [[agar]], [[gelatin]], [[Fruit preserves|jelly]], [[opal]]&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;center&gt;'''Solid sol'''&lt;br /&gt;Example: [[cranberry glass]]&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

In some cases, a colloid can be considered as a homogeneous mixture. This is because the distinction between &quot;dissolved&quot; and &quot;particulate&quot; matter can be sometimes a matter of approach, which affects whether or not it is homogeneous or heterogeneous.

==Hydrocolloids==
A '''hydrocolloid''' is defined as a colloid system wherein the colloid particles are dispersed in [[water]]. A hydrocolloid has colloid particles spread throughout water, and depending on the quantity of water available that can take place in different states, e.g., [[gel]] or [[sol (colloid)|sol]] (liquid). Hydrocolloids can be either [[irreversibility|irreversible]] (single-state) or [[reversibility|reversible]]. For example, [[agar]], a reversible hydrocolloid of [[seaweed]] extract, can exist in a gel and sol state, and alternate between states with the addition or elimination of heat. 

Many hydrocolloids are derived from natural sources. For example, [[agar-agar]] and [[carrageenan]] are extracted from seaweed, [[gelatin]] is produced by hydrolysis of proteins of [[bovinae|bovine]] and fish origins, and [[pectin]] is extracted from [[citrus]] peel and apple [[pomace]].

[[Gelatin dessert]]s like jelly or [[Jell-O]] are made from gelatin powder, another effective hydrocolloid. Hydrocolloids are employed in food mainly to influence [[Mouthfeel|texture]] or [[viscosity]] (e.g., a sauce). Hydrocolloid-based [[dressing (medical)|medical dressing]]s are used for [[Human skin|skin]] and [[wound]] treatment.

Other main hydrocolloids are [[xanthan gum]], [[gum arabic]], [[guar gum]], [[locust bean gum]], cellulose derivatives as [[carboxymethyl cellulose]], [[alginate]] and [[starch]].

==Interaction between colloid particles==
The following forces play an important role in the interaction of colloid particles:
*[[Excluded volume|Excluded volume repulsion]]: This refers to the impossibility of any overlap between hard particles.
*[[Coulomb's law|Electrostatic interaction]]: Colloidal particles often carry an electrical charge and therefore attract or repel each other. The charge of both the continuous and the dispersed phase, as well as the mobility of the phases are factors affecting this interaction.
*[[van der Waals force]]s: This is due to interaction between two dipoles that are either permanent or induced. Even if the particles do not have a permanent dipole, fluctuations of the electron density gives rise to a temporary dipole in a particle. This temporary dipole induces a dipole in particles nearby. The temporary dipole and the induced dipoles are then attracted to each other. This is known as van der Waals force, and is always present (unless the refractive indexes of the dispersed and continuous phases are matched), is short-range, and is attractive.
*[[Entropic force]]s: According to the second law of thermodynamics, a system progresses to a state in which entropy is maximized. This can result in effective forces even between hard spheres.
*[[Steric effects|Steric forces]] between polymer-covered surfaces or in solutions containing non-adsorbing polymer can modulate interparticle forces, producing an additional steric repulsive force (which is predominantly entropic in origin) or an attractive depletion force between them. Such an effect is specifically searched for with tailor-made [[superplasticizer]]s developed to increase the workability of concrete and to reduce its [[water reducer|water content]].

==Preparation of colloids&lt;ref&gt;http://www.substech.com/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=preparation_of_colloids&lt;/ref&gt; ==
There are two principal ways of preparation of colloids:
* Dispersion of large particles to the colloidal dimensions;
* Condensation of molecules dissolved in a true solution into larger colloidal particles.

==Stabilization of a colloidal dispersion (peptization)==
Stabilization serves to prevent colloids from aggregating. Steric stabilization and [[DLVO theory|electrostatic stabilization]] are the two main mechanisms for colloid stabilization. Electrostatic stabilization is based on the mutual repulsion of like electrical charges. In general, different phases have different charge affinities, so that a [[electrical double layer]] forms at any interface. Small particle sizes lead to enormous surface areas, and this effect is greatly amplified in colloids. In a stable colloid, mass of a dispersed phase is so low that its [[buoyancy]] or [[kinetic energy]] is too weak to overcome the electrostatic repulsion between charged layers of the dispersing phase. The charge on the dispersed particles can be observed by applying an electric field: All particles migrate to the same electrode and therefore must all have the same sign charge.

==Destabilizing a colloidal dispersion (flocculation)==
Unstable colloidal dispersions form [[flocculation|flocs]] as the particles aggregate due to interparticle attractions. In this way photonic glasses can be grown. This can be accomplished by a number of different methods:
*Removal of the electrostatic barrier that prevents aggregation of the particles. This can be accomplished by the addition of salt to a suspension or changing the pH of a suspension to effectively neutralize or &quot;screen&quot; the surface charge of the particles in suspension. This removes the repulsive forces that keep colloidal particles separate and allows for coagulation due to van der Waals forces.
*Addition of a charged polymer flocculant. Polymer flocculants can bridge individual colloidal particles by attractive electrostatic interactions. For example, negatively-charged colloidal silica or clay particles can be flocculated by the addition of a positively-charged polymer.
*Addition of non-adsorbed polymers called depletants that cause aggregation due to entropic effects.
*Physical deformation of the particle (e.g., stretching) may increase the van der Waals forces more than stabilization forces (such as electrostatic), resulting coagulation of colloids at certain orientations.

Unstable colloidal suspensions of low-volume fraction form clustered liquid suspensions, wherein individual clusters of particles fall to the bottom of the suspension (or float to the top if the particles are less dense than the suspending medium) once the clusters are of sufficient size for the [[Brownian motion|Brownian forces]] that work to keep the particles in suspension to be overcome by gravitational forces. However, colloidal suspensions of higher-volume fraction form colloidal gels with viscoelastic properties. Viscoelastic colloidal gels, such as [[bentonite]] and [[toothpaste]], flow like liquids under shear, but maintain their shape when shear is removed. It is for this reason that toothpaste can be squeezed from a toothpaste tube, but stays on the toothbrush after it is applied.

===Technique monitoring colloidal stability===
[[Image:MLS scan.gif|thumb|Measurement principle of multiple light scattering coupled with vertical scanning]]

Multiple light scattering coupled with vertical scanning is the most widely used technique to monitor the dispersion state of a product, hence identifying and quantifying destabilisation phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0378-5173(03)00364-8|title=Systematic characterization of oil-in-water emulsions for formulation design|year=2003|last1=Roland|first1=I|journal=International Journal of Pharmaceutics|volume=263|pages=85|pmid=12954183|last2=Piel|first2=G|last3=Delattre|first3=L|last4=Evrard|first4=B|issue=1-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1023/A:1025017502379|year=2003|last1=Lemarchand|first1=Caroline|last2=Couvreur|first2=Patrick|last3=Besnard|first3=Madeleine|last4=Costantini|first4=Dominique|last5=Gref|first5=Ruxandra|journal=Pharmaceutical Research|volume=20|pages=1284|pmid=12948027|title=Novel polyester-polysaccharide nanoparticles.|issue=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0927-7757(98)00680-3|title=Characterisation of instability of concentrated dispersions by a new optical analyser: the TURBISCAN MA 1000|year=1999|last1=Mengual|first1=O|journal=Colloids and Surfaces A: Physicochemical and Engineering Aspects|volume=152|pages=111 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=P. Bru ''et al.''|title= Particle sizing and characterisation|editor=T. Provder and J. Texter|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; It works on concentrated dispersions without dilution. When light is sent through the sample, it is backscattered by the particles / droplets. The backscattering intensity is directly proportional to the size and volume fraction of the dispersed phase. Therefore, local changes in concentration (''e.g.''[[Creaming (chemistry)|Creaming]] and [[Sedimentation]]) and global changes in size (''e.g.'' [[flocculation]], [[coalescence (chemistry)|coalescence]]) are detected and monitored.

===Accelerating methods for shelf life prediction===
The kinetic process of destabilisation can be rather long (up to several months or even years for some products) and it is often required for the formulator to use further accelerating methods in order to reach reasonable development time for new product design. Thermal methods are the most commonly used and consists in increasing temperature to accelerate destabilisation (below critical temperatures of phase inversion or chemical degradation). Temperature affects not only the viscosity, but also interfacial tension in the case of non-ionic surfactants or more generally interactions forces inside the system. Storing a dispersion at high temperatures enables to simulate real life conditions for a product (e.g. tube of sunscreen cream in a car in the summer), but also to accelerate destabilisation processes up to 200 times.
Mechanical acceleration including vibration, [[centrifugation]] and agitation are sometimes used. They subject the product to different forces that pushes the particles / droplets against one another, hence helping in the film drainage. However, some emulsions would never coalesce in normal gravity, while they do under artificial gravity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=hDOS5OfL_pQC&amp;pg=PA89&amp;lpg=PA89|page=89|author= J-L Salager|title=Pharmaceutical emulsions and suspensions|editor=Françoise Nielloud,Gilberte Marti-Mestres|year=2000|isbn=0824703049|publisher=CRC press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover segregation of different populations of particles have been highlighted when using centrifugation and vibration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/la802459u|title=Size Segregation in a Fluid-like or Gel-like Suspension Settling under Gravity or in a Centrifuge|year=2008|last1=Snabre|first1=Patrick|last2=Pouligny|first2=Bernard|journal=Langmuir|volume=24|pages=13338|pmid=18986182|issue=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Colloids as a model system for atoms==
In [[physics]], colloids are an interesting model system for [[atom]]s. Micrometre-scale colloidal particles are large enough to be observed by optical techniques such as [[confocal microscopy]]. Many of the forces that govern the structure and behavior of matter, such as excluded volume interactions or electrostatic forces, govern the structure and behavior of colloidal suspensions. For example, the same techniques used to model ideal gases can be applied to [[Scientific modelling|model]] the behavior of a hard sphere colloidal suspension. In addition, phase transitions in colloidal suspensions can be studied in real time using optical techniques, and are analogous to phase transitions in liquids.

==Colloidal crystals==

{{Main|Colloidal crystal}}

A colloidal crystal is a highly [[Order (crystal lattice)|ordered]] array of particles that can be formed over a very long range (typically on the order of a few [[millimeters]] to one [[centimeter]]) and that appear [[analogous]] to their atomic or molecular counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author =Pieranski, P.|year =1983| title = Colloidal Crystals| journal= Contemporary Physics| volume= 24| page =25|doi =10.1080/00107518308227471|bibcode = 1983ConPh..24...25P }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the finest [[natural]] examples of this ordering phenomenon can be found in precious [[opal]], in which brilliant regions of pure [[spectral]] [[color]] result from [[close-packed]] domains of [[amorphous]] colloidal spheres of [[silicon dioxide]] (or [[silica]], SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author = Sanders, J.V.|year =1964|title = Structure of Opal|journal = Nature |volume=204|page =1151|doi=10.1038/204990a0|last2 = Sanders|first2 = J. V.|last3 = Segnit|first3 = E. R.|bibcode = 1964Natur.204..990J|issue=4962}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author = Darragh, P.J., ''et al.''|year =1976|journal = Scientific American|volume=234|page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; These spherical particles [[precipitate]] in highly [[siliceous]] pools in [[Australia]] and elsewhere, and form these highly ordered arrays after years of [[sedimentation]] and [[compression (physical)|compression]] under [[hydrostatic]] and gravitational forces. The periodic arrays of submicrometre spherical particles provide similar arrays of [[interstitial defect|interstitial]] [[voids]], which act as a natural [[diffraction grating]] for [[visible]] [[light]] [[waves]], particularly when the interstitial spacing is of the same [[order of magnitude]] as the [[incident]] lightwave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= Luck, W. ''et al.''| title = Ber. Busenges|year =1963|journal = Phys. Chem.|volume=67|page = 84}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author = Hiltner, P.A. and Krieger, I.M.|year =1969|title = Diffraction of light by ordered suspensions|journal=J. Phys. Chem.|volume=73|page=2306|doi = 10.1021/j100727a049}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, it has been known for many years that, due to [[Coulomb's Law|repulsive]] [[Coulombic]] interactions, [[electrically charged]] [[macromolecules]] in an [[aqueous]] environment can exhibit long-range [[crystal]]-like correlations with interparticle separation distances, often being considerably greater than the individual particle diameter. In all of these cases in nature, the same brilliant [[iridescence]] (or play of colors) can be attributed to the diffraction and [[constructive interference]] of visible lightwaves that satisfy [[Bragg’s law]], in a matter analogous to the [[scattering]] of [[X-rays]] in crystalline solids.

The large number of experiments exploring the [[physics]] and [[chemistry]] of these so-called &quot;colloidal crystals&quot; has emerged as a result of the relatively simple methods that have evolved in the last 20 years for preparing synthetic monodisperse colloids (both polymer and mineral) and, through various mechanisms, implementing and preserving their long-range order formation.

==Colloids in biology==
In the early 20th century, before [[enzyme|enzymology]] was well understood, colloids were thought to be the key to the operation of [[enzyme]]s; i.e., the addition of small quantities of an enzyme to a quantity of water would, in some fashion yet to be specified, subtly alter the properties of the water so that it would break down the enzyme's specific [[Enzyme substrate|substrate]],{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} such as a solution of [[ATPase]] breaking down [[adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]. Furthermore, [[life]] itself was explainable in terms of the aggregate properties of all the colloidal substances that make up an [[organism]]. As more detailed knowledge of [[biology]] and [[biochemistry]] developed, the colloidal theory was replaced by the [[macromolecule|macromolecular]] theory, which explains an enzyme as a collection of identical huge [[molecule]]s that act as very tiny [[machine]]s, freely moving about between the water molecules of the solution and individually operating on the substrate, no more mysterious than a [[factory]] full of machinery. The properties of the water in the solution are not altered, other than the simple [[osmosis|osmotic]] changes that would be caused by the presence of any [[solution|solute]]. In humans, both the [[thyroid gland]] and the [[intermediate lobe]] (''pars intermedia'') of the [[pituitary gland]] contain colloid follicles.

==Use in intravenous therapy==
Colloid solutions used in [[intravenous therapy]] belong to a major group of [[volume expander]]s, and can be used for intravenous [[fluid replacement]]. Colloids preserve a high [[colloid osmotic pressure]] in the blood,&lt;ref name=gregory&gt;[http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/503138 An Update on Intravenous Fluids] by Gregory S. Martin, MD, MSc&lt;/ref&gt; and therefore, they should theoretically preferentially increase the [[intravascular volume]], whereas other types of volume expanders called [[crystalloid]]s also increases the [[interstitial volume]] and [[intracellular volume]]. However, there is still controversy to the actual difference in efficacy by this difference.&lt;ref name=gregory/&gt; Another difference is that crystalloids generally are much cheaper than colloids.&lt;ref name=gregory/&gt;
Recently, however, it has been determined that the use of colloids was bolstered by faked research studies [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/8360667/Millions-of-surgery-patients-at-risk-in-drug-research-fraud-scandal.html]

[[File:Indians Attacking a Stage-Coach BAH-p243.png|thumb|right|200px|Riding shotgun]]
'''Riding shotgun''' refers to the practice of sitting alongside the driver in a moving vehicle.

The expression was applied originally to the movie depiction of [[stagecoach]]es and wagons in the [[Wild West]], in danger of being robbed or attacked. An employee or passenger would sit beside the driver, carrying a [[shotgun]] or [[rifle]], to provide an armed response in case of threat to the cargo or passengers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/riding-shotgun.html|title=Riding shotgun|work=phrases.org.uk|accessdate=1 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, the term has been applied to a game, typically played by groups of friends to determine who rides beside the driver in a car. Typically, this involves claiming the right to ride shotgun by calling out 'shotgun' first.  There may be elaborate rules involved in the game, such as a requirement that the vehicle be in sight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bored.com/shotgunguide/index.htm|title=Shotgun Rules|work=bored.com|accessdate=1 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joshua Pearson, Thomas Reuter, William Henderson. [http://www.shotgunrules.com/ &quot;Official Shotgun Rules&quot;] Retrieved on 2010-07-08&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also used to mean giving actual or figurative support or aid to someone in a situation or project, i.e. to &quot;watch their back&quot;.

Furthermore, they are not always in agreement on various figures including population and GDP, even (on occasion) when supposedly taken from the same year.  If you notice a discrepancy, it's probably best to use the more cautious figure.

[[user:-- April]] suggested adding bits on contentious relationships between countries, including e.g. the U.S. and Afghanistan, but not including the more U.S.-centric bits about countries with amicable relations (e.g. location of U.S. embassies in Jamaica, Ireland, etc.)

'''Cooking''' is the process of preparing [[food]] by use of [[heat]].  Cooking techniques and ingredients vary widely across the world, reflecting unique environmental, economic, and cultural traditions. Cooks themselves also vary widely in skill and training.

[[File:BBQ Food.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Chicken]], [[pork]] and [[bacon]]-wrapped [[Maize|corn]] cooked in a [[barbecue]] smoker]]

[[Control of fire by early humans|Preparing food with heat or fire]] is an activity unique to humans, and some scientists believe the advent of cooking played an important role in human evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2009/02/090213-human-diet-cooking.html |title=? |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most anthropologists believe that cooking fires first developed around 250,000 years ago. The development of [[agriculture]], commerce and transportation between civilizations in different regions offered cooks many new ingredients. New inventions and technologies, such as [[pottery]] for holding and boiling water, expanded cooking techniques. Some modern cooks apply advanced scientific techniques to food preparation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=a-new-spin-on-cooking |title=A New Spin on Cooking |author=W. Wayt Gibbs and Nathan Myhrvold |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of cooking ==
[[Image:Jean-François Millet (II) 005.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Historical [[Oven]] cooking depicted in a painting by [[Jean-François Millet]]]]
[[Image:Foods.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Cooking utilizes many [[foods]].]]
{{See also|Culinary arts}}

There is no clear evidence as to when cooking was invented. [[Primatologist]] [[Richard Wrangham]] stated that cooking was invented as far back as 1.8 million to 2.3 million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amazon.com/Catching-Fire-Cooking-Made-Human/dp/0465013627 Catching Fire: How Cooking Made Us Human]&lt;/ref&gt; Other researchers believe that cooking was invented as late as 40,000 or 10,000 years ago. Evidence of fire is inconclusive, as wildfires started by lightning-strikes are still common in East Africa and other wild areas, and it is difficult to determine when fire was first used for cooking, as opposed to just being used for warmth or for keeping predators away. Most anthropologists contend that cooking fires began in earnest barely 250,000 years ago, when ancient hearths, earth ovens, burnt animal bones, and flint appear across Europe and the middle East. The only evidence of human use of fire more than two million years ago is burnt earth with human remains, which most anthropologists consider coincidence rather than evidence of intentional.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

However, some  [[Fire-cracked rock]], such as that in Central Texas (United States) are burned rock [[midden]]s, or enormous piles fire-damaged rock dated to c. 3,500 years ago. These may represent the remains of earth ovens used in cooking since they contain evidence of ''[[Dasylirion wheeleri]]'' bulbs and other plants. In [[Great Britain]] similar [[Neolithic]], [[Bronze Age]] and [[Iron Age]] features exist, but are commonly called 'burnt mounds'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Ingredients in cooking==
Most ingredients in cooking are derived from [[organism|living things.]] Vegetables, fruits, grains and nuts come from plants, while meat, eggs, and dairy products come from animals. Mushrooms and the yeast used in baking are kinds of [[fungi]]. Cooks also utilize water and minerals such as salt. Cooks can also use [[wine]], an alcohol-based liquid from the fermentation of juices of grapes or other fruits.

Naturally occurring ingredients contain various amounts of molecules called ''proteins'', ''carbohydrates'' and ''fats''. They also contain water and minerals. Cooking involves a manipulation of the chemical properties of these molecules.

=== Proteins ===
[[Image:Meatfoodgroup.jpg|thumb|left|340px|Various raw [[meat]]s]]
[[Image:Kidney beans.jpg|thumb|right|Red [[kidney beans]] contain protein.]]
{{Main|Protein}}

Edible animal material, including [[muscle]], [[offal]], [[milk]], [[egg (food)|eggs]] and [[egg white]]s, contains substantial amounts of protein. Almost all [[vegetable]] matter (in particular [[legumes]] and [[seeds]]) also includes proteins, although generally in smaller amounts. These may also be a source of [[essential amino acid]]s. When [[protein]]s are heated they become denatured and change texture. In many cases, this causes the structure of the material to become softer or more [[friable]] - meat becomes ''cooked''. In some cases, proteins can form more rigid structures, such as the coagulation of [[albumen]] in egg whites. The formation of a relatively rigid but flexible matrix from egg white provides an important component of much [[cake]] cookery, and also underpins many desserts based on [[meringue]].

=== Carbohydrates ===
[[Image:starchy-foods..jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[cereal|Grain]] products are often [[bake]]d, and are rich sources of [[Complex carbohydrates|complex]] and [[simple carbohydrates]].]]

{{Main|Carbohydrates}}

Carbohydrates include the common sugar, [[sucrose]] (table sugar), a disaccharide, and such simple [[sugar]]s as [[glucose]] (from the digestion of table sugar) and [[fructose]] (from fruit), and [[starch]]es from sources such as cereal flour, [[rice]], [[arrowroot]], [[potato]]. The interaction of heat and carbohydrate is complex.

[[Polysaccharide|Long-chain sugars]] such as [[starch]] tend to break down into [[Monosaccharide|simpler sugar]]s when cooked, while simple sugars can form [[syrup]]s. If sugars are heated so that all water of [[crystallisation]] is driven off, then [[caramelization]] starts, with the sugar undergoing thermal decomposition with the formation of [[carbon]], and other breakdown products producing [[caramel]]. Similarly, the heating of sugars and proteins elicits the [[Maillard reaction]], a basic flavor-enhancing technique.

An [[emulsion]] of starch with fat or water can, when gently heated, provide thickening to the dish being cooked. In [[Europe]]an cooking, a mixture of [[butter]] and [[flour]] called a [[roux]] is used to thicken liquids to make stews or sauces. In [[Asia]]n cooking, a similar effect is obtained from a mixture of [[rice]] or [[corn starch]] and water. These techniques rely on the properties of starches to create simpler mucilaginous [[saccharide]]s during cooking, which causes the familiar thickening of [[sauce]]s. This thickening will break down, however, under additional heat.

=== Fats ===
[[Image:Gambas a la gabardina-2009.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Tempura]] [[Deep fried]] [[shrimp]] is usually cooked in [[vegetable oil]] and is often served with [[Soy Sauce]].]]
{{Main|Fat}}
Types of fat include [[vegetable oil]]s and animal products such as [[butter]] and [[lard]]. Fats can reach temperatures higher than the boiling point of water, and are often used to conduct high heat to other ingredients, such as in frying or sautéing.

=== Water ===
[[Image:Cuisson des pates.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Water is often used to cook foods such as [[noodles]].]]
{{Main|Water}}
Cooking often involves [[water]], which is frequently present in other [[liquids]], both added in order to immerse the substances being cooked (typically [[water]], [[stock (food)|stock]] or [[wine]]), and released from the foods themselves. Liquids are so important to cooking that the name of the cooking method used is often based on how the liquid is combined with the food, as in [[steaming]], [[simmer]]ing, [[boiling]], [[braising]], and [[blanching (cooking)|blanching]]. Heating liquid in an open container results in rapidly increased [[evaporation]], which [[concentrate]]s the remaining [[flavor]] and ingredients - this is a critical component of both [[stewing]] and sauce making.

=== Vitamins and minerals ===
{{Main|Vitamins|Minerals}}
Vitamins are materials required for normal [[metabolism]] but which the body cannot manufacture itself and which must therefore come from soil. Vitamins come from a number of sources including fresh fruit and vegetables ([[Vitamin C]]), [[carrot]]s, [[liver]] ([[Vitamin A]]), cereal bran, bread, liver e ( B vitamins), fish liver oil ([[Vitamin D]]) and fresh green vegetables ([[Vitamin K]]). Many minerals are also essential in small quantities including [[iron]], [[calcium]], [[magnesium]] and [[sulphur]]; and in very small quantities [[copper]], [[zinc]] and [[selenium]]. The micronutrients, minerals, and vitamins&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brighthub.com/health/diet-nutrition/articles/44825.aspx Loss of nutrients when vegetables are cooked]&lt;/ref&gt; in fruit and vegetables may be destroyed or eluted by cooking. Vitamin C is especially prone to oxidation during cooking and may be completely destroyed by protracted cooking.&lt;ref name=&quot;news.bbc.co.uk&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/359175.stm | work=BBC News | title=Cooking vegetables 'improves benefits' | date=1999-06-02 | accessdate=2010-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods of cooking==
There are very many methods of cooking, most of which have been known since antiquity. These include baking, roasting, frying, grilling, barbecuing, smoking, boiling, steaming and braising. A more recent innovation is microwaving. Various methods use differing levels of heat and moisture and vary in cooking time. The method chosen greatly affects the end result. Some foods are more appropriate to some methods than others. Some major hot cooking techniques include:

===Roasting===
: [[Roasting]] - [[Barbecuing]] - [[Grilling]] - [[Rotisserie]] - [[Searing]]

When heat is used in the preparation of food, it can kill or inactivate potentially harmful organisms including [[bacteria]] and [[virus]]es.

The effect will depend on temperature, cooking time, and technique used. The temperature range from 41 °F to 135 °F (5 °C to 57 °C) is the &quot;[[Danger zone (food safety)|food danger zone]].&quot; Between these temperatures bacteria can grow rapidly. Under optimal conditions, ''[[E. coli]]'', for example, can double in number every twenty minutes. The food may not appear any different or spoiled but can be harmful to anyone who eats it. [[Meat]], [[poultry]], dairy products, and other prepared food must be kept outside of the &quot;food danger zone&quot; to remain safe to eat. [[Refrigeration]] and freezing do not kill bacteria, but only slow their growth. When cooling hot food, it should not be left standing or in a [[blast chiller]] for more than 90 minutes.
[[Cutting board]]s are a potential breeding ground for [[bacteria]], and can be quite hazardous unless safety precautions are taken.  Plastic cutting boards are less porous than wood and have conventionally been assumed to be far less likely to harbor bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ag.arizona.edu/pubs/health/foodsafety/az1076.html|title=Cutting Boards (Plastic Versus Wood)|publisher=Cooperative Extension, College of Agriculture &amp; Life Sciences, the University of Arizona|work=Food Safety, Preparation and Storage Tips|year=1998|accessdate=2006-06-21 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060613074257/http://ag.arizona.edu/pubs/health/foodsafety/az1076.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been debated, and some research has shown wooden boards are far better.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReluctantGourmet&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reluctantgourmet.com/cutting_board.htm|title=Cutting Boards - wood or plastic?|work=ReluctantGourmet.com|accessdate=2006-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Washing and [[sanitize|sanitizing]] cutting boards is highly recommended, especially after use with raw meat, poultry, or seafood.  Hot water and soap followed by a rinse with an antibacterial cleaner (dilute bleach is common in a mixture of 1 [[tablespoon]] per [[gallon]] of water, as at that dilution it is considered food safe, though some professionals choose not to use this method because they believe it could taint some foods), or a trip through a dishwasher with a &quot;sanitize&quot; cycle, are effective methods for reducing the risk of illness due to contaminated cooking implements.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReluctantGourmet&quot;/

Cooking prevents many [[foodborne illness]]es that would otherwise occur if the raw food was eaten. Cooking also increases the digestibility of some foods such as grains. Many foods are inedible raw. For example [[kidney beans]] are toxic when raw, due to the chemical [[phytohaemagglutinin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Noah ND, Bender AE, Reaidi GB, Gilbert RJ |title=Food poisoning from raw red kidney beans |journal=Br Med J |volume=281 |issue=6234 |pages=236–7 |year=1980 |month=Jul |pmid=7407532 |doi= |url= |pmc=1713670}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Effects on nutritional content of food ===

Proponents of [[Raw foodism]] argue that cooking food increases the risk of some of the detrimental effects on food or health. They point out that the cooking of vegetables and fruit containing [[vitamin C]] both elutes the vitamin into the cooking water and degrades the vitamin through oxidation.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} Peeling vegetables can also substantially reduce the vitamin C content, especially in the case of [[potato]]es where most vitamin C is in the skin.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} However, research has also suggested that a greater proportion of nutrients present in food is absorbed from cooked foods than from uncooked foods.&lt;ref name=&quot;news.bbc.co.uk&quot;/&gt;

Baking, grilling or broiling food, especially starchy foods, until a toasted crust is formed generates significant concentrations of [[acrylamide]], a possible [[carcinogen]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

Cooking dairy products may reduce a protective effect against colon cancer. Researchers at the [[University of Toronto]] suggest that ingesting uncooked or unpasteurized [[dairy|dairy products]] (see also [[Raw milk]]) may reduce the risk of [[colorectal cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/01635589509514381 |author=Corpet DE, Yin Y, Zhang XM, ''et al.'' |title=Colonic protein fermentation and promotion of colon carcinogenesis by thermolyzed casein |journal=Nutr Cancer |volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=271–81 |year=1995 |pmid=7603887 |pmc=2518970 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mice and rats fed uncooked sucrose, casein, and beef tallow had one-third to one-fifth the incidence of [[adenoma|microadenoma]]s as the mice and rats fed the same ingredients cooked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Corpet DE, Stamp D, Medline A, Minkin S, Archer MC, Bruce WR |title=Promotion of colonic microadenoma growth in mice and rats fed cooked sugar or cooked casein and fat |journal=Cancer Res. |volume=50 |issue=21 |pages=6955–8 |year=1990 |month=November |pmid=2208161 |url=http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=2208161}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/jnci/84.13.1026 |author=Zhang XM, Stamp D, Minkin S, ''et al.'' |title=Promotion of aberrant crypt foci and cancer in rat colon by thermolyzed protein |journal=J.

According to the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|Food and Drug Administration]] of the United States, health benefits claimed by raw milk advocates do not exist. &quot;The small quantities of antibodies in milk are not absorbed in the human intestinal tract,&quot; says Barbara Ingham, Ph.D., associate professor and extension food scientist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. &quot;There is no scientific evidence that raw milk contains an anti-arthritis factor or that it enhances resistance to other diseases.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/fdac/features/2004/504_milk.html &quot;Got Milk?&quot;] by Linda Bren. ''FDA Consumer''.  Sept-Oct 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several studies published since 1990 indicate that cooking muscle meat creates [[heterocyclic amine]]s (HCAs), which are thought to increase cancer risk in humans. Researchers at the [[National Cancer Institute]] found that human subjects who ate beef rare or medium-rare had less than one third the risk of stomach cancer than those who ate beef medium-well or well-done.&lt;ref name=amines&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Risk/heterocyclic-amines |title=Heterocyclic Amines in Cooked Meats |author= |date= |work= |publisher=[[National Cancer Institute]] |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; While eating meat raw may be the only way to avoid HCAs fully, the National Cancer Institute states that cooking meat below {{convert|212|F|lk=on}} creates &quot;negligible amounts&quot; of HCAs. Also, [[microwaving]] meat before cooking may reduce HCAs by 90%.&lt;ref name=amines/&gt; [[Nitrosamine]]s, present in processed and cooked foods, have also been noted as being carcinogenic, being linked to colon cancer.

Research has shown that grilling or barbecuing meat and fish increases levels of carcinogenic [[Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons]] (PAH). However, meat and fish only contribute a small proportion of dietary PAH intake - most intake comes from cereals, oils and fats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/food/fs/sc/scf/out154_en.pdf |title=Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons - Occurrence in foods, dietary exposure and health effects |author=Scientific Committee on Food |date=4 December 2002 |work= |publisher=[[European Commission]] |accessdate=21 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Germany|German]] research in 2003 showed significant benefits in reducing [[breast cancer]] risk when large amounts of raw vegetable matter are included in the diet. The authors attribute some of this effect to heat-labile [[phytonutrients]].&lt;ref&gt;Nutr Cancer. 2003;46(2):131-7&lt;/ref&gt;

Heating sugars with proteins or fats can produce [[Advanced glycation end product]]s (&quot;glycotoxins&quot;).&lt;ref name=kosch&gt;{{Cite journal| author = Koschinsky T, He CJ, Mitsuhashi T, Bucala R, Liu C, Buenting C, Heitmann K, Vlassara H | title = Orally absorbed reactive glycation products (glycotoxins): an environmental risk factor in diabetic nephropathy | journal =Proc.

== Science of cooking ==
[[Image:Küche.JPG|thumb|left|270px|A [[restaurant]] [[kitchen]] in Munich, Germany (Haxnbauer restaurant).]]
[[Image:Chinesische Küche.jpg|thumb|270px|A kitchen in [[Beijing]], [[China]] with an assortment of foods.]]

The application of [[scientific knowledge]] to cooking and [[gastronomy]] has become known as [[molecular gastronomy]]. This is a subdiscipline of [[food science]]. Important contributions have been made by scientists, chefs and authors such as [[Herve This]] (chemist), [[Nicholas Kurti]] (physicist), [[Peter Barham]] (physicist), [[Harold McGee]] (author), [[Shirley Corriher]] (biochemist, author), [[Heston Blumenthal]] (chef), [[Ferran Adria]] (chef), [[Robert Wolke]] (chemist, author) and [[Pierre Gagnaire]] (chef).

Chemical processes central to cooking include the [[Maillard reaction]] - a form of non-enzymatic browning involving an amino acid, a reducing sugar and heat.

== Home-cooking vs. factory cooking ==
Although cooking has traditionally been a process carried out informally at home or around a communal fire, cooking is often, and increasingly, carried out outside the home. [[Bakeries]] were an early form of cooking outside the home, and bakeries in the past often offered the cooking of foods provided by their customers as an additional service. In the present day, factory food preparation is rapidly becoming the norm, with many &quot;ready-to-eat&quot; foods being prepared and cooked in factories.

&quot;Home-cooking&quot; may be associated with comfort food, and some commercially produced foods are presented as having been &quot;home-cooked&quot;, regardless of their actual origin.

&lt;!--This article will describe the general mechanics of card games: that is, those rules which are so widely known that they are often omitted in rules of card games, because the author assumes that &quot;everyone&quot; knows them.
The statements given here are general ones. There are countless exceptions to them. Indeed, it would be possible to suffix almost every statement in this section with the words &quot;an exception is provided by the game of such-and-such&quot;. They should therefore not be taken as rules; rather they should be used as default rules if you are trying to play a game from an incomplete set of rules which omits the general mechanics.--&gt;
A '''card game''' is any [[game]] using [[playing card]]s as the primary device with which the game is played, be they traditional or game-specific. Countless card games exist, including families of related games (such as [[poker]]). A small number of card games played with traditional decks have formally standardized rules, but most are folk games whose rules vary by region, culture, and person.

Many games that are not generally placed in the family of card games do in fact use cards for some aspect of their gameplay. Similarly, some games that are placed in the card game genre involve a board. The distinction is that the gameplay of a card game primarily depends on the use of the cards by players (the board is simply a guide for scorekeeping or for card placement), while [[board games]] (the principal non-card game genre to use cards) generally focus on the players' positions on the board, and use the cards for some secondary purpose.

==Playing cards==
{{main|Playing card}}
[[File:15thCenturySpanishCardDeck.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Three Spanish playing cards, c.1500]]
[[File:Mamluk playing card 7.jpg|thumb|right|Mamluk playing card (king of cups), c.15th century]]
A card game is played with a ''deck'' or ''pack'' of [[playing card]]s which are identical in size and shape. Each card has two sides, the ''face'' and the ''back''. Normally the backs of the cards are indistinguishable. The faces of the cards may all be unique, or there can be duplicates. The composition of a deck is known to each player. In some cases several decks are shuffled together to form a single ''pack'' or ''shoe''.

The same kind of games can also be played with tiles made of wood, plastic, bone, or similar materials. The most notable examples of such tile sets are [[dominoes]], [[mahjong tiles]] and [[Rummikub]] tiles. [[Chinese dominoes]] are also available as playing cards. It is not clear whether [[Emperor Muzong of Liao]] really played with domino cards as early as 969, though.&lt;ref name=parlett/&gt;{{rp|39}}&lt;ref name=lo&gt;{{Citation |last=Lo |first=Andrew |title=The Game of Leaves: An Inquiry into the origin of Chinese playing cards |year=2000 |volume=63 |journal=Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London |pages=389–406}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Legend dates the invention of dominoes in the year 1112, and the earliest known domino rules are from the following decade. 500 years later domino cards were reported as a new invention.&lt;ref name=lo/&gt;

The earliest definite mention of playing cards is in a judgement on gambling by [[Kublai Khan]] on 17 July 1294.&lt;ref name=lo/&gt; A precise description of Chinese money playing cards (in four suits) survived from the 15th century. Mahjong tiles are a 19th century invention based on three-suited money playing card decks, similar to the way in which Rummikub tiles were derived recently from modern Western playing cards.&lt;ref name=parlett/&gt;

Nowadays, the best-known deck internationally is the French-suited deck with English styling. This deck contains 4&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;13&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;52 unique cards – one for each combination of the four French ''[[suit (cards)|suits]]'' ''spades'', ''hearts'', ''diamonds'' and ''clubs'' and the thirteen ''ranks'' running from ''king'', ''queen'', ''jack'', ''ten'', ''nine'' down to ''two'' (or ''deuce'') and ''ace''. Optionally, such decks may come with up to four additional suitless cards known as [[Joker (playing card)|joker]]s. In many European countries, French-suited decks are used with different local styling. As many continental European games are played with less than 52 cards, smaller decks that lack the highest or lowest numerical ranks (other than the ace) are more common than 52-card decks in some countries. Most notably, the French-suited 32-card [[piquet deck]] only has the ranks from king, queen etc. down to seven and ace.

The French suits came up around 1480 and were cheaper to pring. In France they mostly replaced the earlier Latin suits ''swords'', ''clubs'', ''cups'' and ''coins'',&lt;ref name=parlett&gt;* {{Citation |last=Parlett |first=David |title=The Oxford guide to card games: a historical survey |year=1990 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-214165-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|43}} which are still common in Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking countries as well as in some northern regions of Italy.&lt;ref name=parlett/&gt;{{rp|30f}} A full Latin-suited deck generally consists of only 48 cards, lacking the tens. Instead of queens it has ''knights'' or ''cavaliers'', and instead of jacks it has ''servants'' or ''valets''. But nowadays the most common Latin-suited deck has only 40 cards, dropping ranks eight to ten.&lt;ref name=parlett/&gt;{{rp|30f}}

Playing cards first appeared in Europe in the last quarter of the 14th century.&lt;ref name=parlett/&gt;{{rp|35}} The earliest European references speak of a [[Saracen]] or [[Moors|Moorish]] game called ''naib'', and in fact an almost complete [[Mamluk]] Egyptian deck of 52 cards in a distinct oriental design has survived from around the same time, with the four suits ''swords'', ''polo sticks'', ''cups'' and ''coins'' and the ranks ''king'', ''governor'', ''second governor'', and ''ten'' to ''one''.&lt;ref name=parlett/&gt;{{rp|40f}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Some remarks on Mamluk playing cards |last1=Dummett |first1=Michael |last2=Abu-Deeb |first2=Kamal |journal=Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes |volume=63 |year=1973 |pages=106–128}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional playing cards in [[Central Europe]] have German suits and are generally more similar to Latin-suited cards than to French-suited cards. Switzerland has a distinct variant of German suits. However, in many areas German-suited cards have been replaced by French-suited cards.

The 1430s in Italy saw the invention of the [[tarot deck]], a full Latin-suited deck augmented by suitless cards with painted motifs that played a special role as trumps. [[Tarot, tarock and tarocchi games]] are still played with (subsets of) these decks in parts of Central Europe. The replacement of these decks by French-suited tarot decks in France is a relatively recent development.

In Japan, a distinct 48-card [[hanafuda]] deck is popular. It is derived from 16th century Portuguese decks. Apart from general-purpose decks of playing cards, dedicated decks are manufactured for various purposes.

==Typical structure of card games==
===Number and association of players===
[[Image:Paul Cézanne, Les joueurs de carte (1892-95).jpg|thumb|''The Card Players - a painting by [[Paul Cézanne]], 1895.'']]
Any specific card game imposes restrictions on the number of players. The most significant dividing lines run between one-player games and two-player games, and between two-player games and multi-player games. Card games for one player are known as ''solitaire'' or ''patience'' card games. (See [[list of solitaire card games]].) Generally speaking, they are in many ways special and atypical, although some of them have given rise to two- or multi-player games such as [[Spite and Malice]].

In card games for two players, usually not all cards are distributed to the players, as they would otherwise have perfect information about the game state. Two-player games have always been immensely popular and include some of the most significant card games such as [[piquet]], [[bezique]], [[sixty-six (card game)|sixty-six]], [[klaberjass]], [[gin rummy]] and [[cribbage]]. Many multi-player games started as two-player games that were adapted to a greater number of players. For such adaptations a number of non-obvious choices must be made beginning with the choice of a game orientation.

One way of extending a two-player game to more players is by building two teams of equal size. A common case is four players in two fixed partnerships, sitting crosswise as in [[whist]] and [[contract bridge]]. Partners sit opposite to each other and cannot see each other's hands. If communication between the partners is allowed at all, then it is usually restricted to a specific list of permitted signs and signals. 17th century French partnership games such as [[triomphe]] were special in that partners sat next to each other and were allowed to communicate freely so long as they did not exchange cards or played out of order.

Another way of extending a two-player game to more players is as a ''cut-throat'' game, in which all players fight on their own, and win or lose alone. Most cut-throat card games are ''round games'', i.e. they can be played by any number of players starting from two or three, so long as there are enough cards for all.

For some of the most interesting games such as [[ombre]], [[tarot, tarock and tarocchi games|tarot]] and [[skat (card game)]], the associations between players change from hand to hand. Ultimately players all play on their own, but for each hand, some game mechanism divides the players into two teams. Most typically these are ''solo games'', i.e. games in which one player becomes the soloist and has to achieve some objective against the others, who form a team and win or lose all their points jointly. But in games for more than three players, there may also be a mechanism that selects two players who then have to play against the others.

===Direction of play===
The players of a card game normally form a circle around a table or other space that can hold cards. The ''game orientation'' or ''direction of play'', which obviously is only relevant for three or more players, can be either clockwise or counter-clockwise. It is the direction in which various roles in the game proceed. Most regions have a traditional direction of play, such as:
*Counter-clockwise in most of Asia and in South America.
*Clockwise in North America and Australia.
Europe is roughly divided into a clockwise area in the north and a counter-clockwise area in the south. The boundary runs between France, Germany, Austria (mostly), the Czech Republic, Poland, Ukraine and Russia (clockwise) and Portugal, Spain, Switzerland, Italy, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania, Turkey (counter-clockwise).

Games that originate in a region with a strong preference are often initially played in the original direction, even in regions that prefer the opposite direction. For games that have official rules and are played in tournaments, the direction of play is often prescribed in those rules.

===Determining who deals===
Most games have some form of asymmetry between players. The roles of players are normally expressed in terms of the ''dealer'', i.e. the player whose task it is to shuffle the cards and distribute them to the players. Being the dealer can be a (minor or major) advantage or disadvantage, depending on the game. Therefore, after each played hand, the deal normally passes to the next player according to the game orientation.

As it can still be an advantage or disadvantage to be the first dealer, there are some standard methods for determining who is the first dealer. A common method is by cutting, which works as follows. One player shuffles the deck and places it on the table. Each player lifts a packet of cards from the top, reveals its bottom card, and returns it to the deck. The player who reveals the highest (or lowest) card becomes dealer. In case of a tie, the process is repeated by the tied players. For some games such as whist this process of cutting is part of the official rules, and the hierarchy of cards for the purpose of cutting (which need not be the same as that used otherwise in the game) is also specified. But in general any method can be used, such as tossing a coin in case of a two-player game, drawing cards until one player draws an ace, or rolling dice.

===Hands, rounds and games===
&lt;!-- [[Elder hand]] redirects here. Update redirect if title changes. --&gt;
A ''hand'' is a unit of the game that begins with the dealer shuffling and dealing the cards as described below, and ends with the players scoring and the next dealer being determined. The set of cards that each player receives and holds in his or her hands is also known as that player's hand. The hand is over when the players have finished playing their hands. Most often this occurs when one player (or all) has no cards left. The player who sits after the dealer in the direction of play is known as ''eldest hand'' (or in two-player games as ''elder hand''). A ''game round'' consists of as many hands as their are players. After each hand, the deal is passed on in the direction of play, i.e. the previous eldest hand becomes the new dealer. Normally players score points after each hand. A game may consist of a fixed number of rounds. Alternatively it can be played for a fixed number of points. In this case it is over with the hand in which a player reaches the target score.

===Shuffling===
{{main|Shuffling}}
Shuffling is the process of bringing the cards of a pack into a random order. There is a large number of techniques with various advantages and disadvantages. ''Riffle shuffling'' is a method in which the deck is divided into two roughly equal-sized halves that are bended and then released, so that the cards interlace. Repeating this process several times randomizes the deck well, but the method is harder to learn than some others and may damage the cards. The ''overhand shuffle'' and the ''Hindu shuffle'' are two techniques that work by taking batches of cards from the top of the deck and reassembling them in the opposite order. They are easier to learn but must be repeated more often. A method suitable for small children consists in spreading the cards on a large surface and moving them around before picking up the deck again. This is also the most common method for shuffling tiles such as dominoes.

For casino games that are played for large sums it is vital that the cards are properly randomised, but for many games this is less critical, and in fact player experience can suffer when the cards are shuffled too well. The official [[skat (card game)|skat]] rules stipulate that the cards are ''shuffled well'', but according to a decision of the German skat court, a one-handed player should ask another player to do the shuffling, rather than use a [[shuffling machine]], as it would shuffle the cards ''too'' well. French [[belote]] rules go so far as to prescribe that the deck is never shuffled between hands.

===Deal===
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Spit (card game)]] --&gt; 
In games where cards are distributed among players, the &quot;deal&quot; is the act of that distribution. 

The dealer takes all of the cards in the pack, arranges them so that they are in a uniform stack, and [[shuffle]]s them. In strict play, the dealer then offers the deck to the previous player (in the sense of the game direction) for ''[[cut (playing cards)|cutting]]''. If the deal is clockwise, this is the player to the dealer's right; if counterclockwise, it is the player to the dealer's left. The invitation to cut is made by placing the pack, face downward, on the table near the player who is to cut: who then lifts the upper portion of the pack clear of the lower portion and places it alongside. (Normally the two portions have about equal size. Strict rules often indicate that each portion must contain a certain minimum number of cards, such as three or five.) The formerly lower portion is then replaced on top of the formerly upper portion. Instead of cutting, one may also knock on the deck to indicate that on trusts the dealer to have shuffled fairly.

The actual ''deal'' (distribution of cards) is done in the direction of play, beginning with eldest hand. The dealer holds the pack, face down, in one hand, and removes cards from the top of it with his or her other hand to distribute to the players, placing them face down on the table in front of the players to whom they are dealt. The cards may be dealt one at a time, or in batches of more than one card; and all or a determined amount of cards are dealt out. The undealt cards, if any, are left face down in the middle of the table, forming the ''stock'' (also called talon, widow or skat). 

Throughout the shuffle, cut, and deal, the dealer should prevent the players from seeing the faces of any of the cards. The players should not try to see any of the faces. Should a player accidentally see a card, other than one's own, proper etiquette would be to admit this. It is also dishonest to try to see cards as they are dealt, or to take advantage of having seen a card. Should a card accidentally become exposed, (visible to all), then, normally, any player can demand a redeal (all the cards are gathered up, and the shuffle, cut, and deal are repeated). 

When the deal is complete, all players pick up their cards, or 'hand', and hold them in such a way that the faces can be seen by the holder of the cards but not the other players, or vice versa depending on the game. It is helpful to fan one's cards out so that if they have corner indices all their values can be seen at once. In most games, it is also useful to sort one's hand, rearranging the cards in a way appropriate to the game. For example, in a [[trick-taking game]] it may be easier to have all one's cards of the same suit together, whereas in a [[rummy]] game one might sort them by rank or by potential combinations.

==Rules==
[[Image:Copertina-manuale-Mah-Jongg.jpg|thumb|125px|right|Manual of [[Mahjong|Mah-Jongg rules]], Madrid 1923.]]

A new card game starts in a small way, either as someone's invention, or as a modification of an existing game. Those playing it may agree to change the rules as they wish. The rules that they agree on become the &quot;house rules&quot; under which they play the game. A set of house rules may be accepted as valid by a group of players wherever they play, as it may also be accepted as governing all play within a particular house, café, or club.

When a game becomes sufficiently popular, so that people often play it with strangers, there is a need for a generally accepted set of rules. This need is often met when a particular set of house rules becomes generally recognized. For example, when [[Whist]] became popular in 18th-century [[England]], players in the [[Portland Club]] agreed on a set of house rules for use on its premises. Players in some other clubs then agreed to follow the &quot;Portland Club&quot; rules, rather than go to the trouble of codifying and printing their own sets of rules. The Portland Club rules eventually became generally accepted throughout England and Western cultures.

It should be noted that there is nothing static or &quot;official&quot; about this process. For the majority of games, there is no one set of universal rules by which the game is played, and the most common ruleset is no more or less than that. Many widely played card games, such as [[Canasta]] and [[Pinochle]], have no official regulating body. The most common ruleset is often determined by the most popular distribution of rulebooks for card games. Perhaps the original compilation of popular playing card games was collected by [[Edmund Hoyle]], a self-made authority on many popular parlor games. The [[U.S. Playing Card Company]] now owns the eponymous Hoyle brand, and publishes a series of rulebooks for various families of card games that have largely standardized the games' rules in countries and languages where the rulebooks are widely distributed. However, players are free to, and often do, invent &quot;house rules&quot; to supplement or even largely replace the &quot;standard&quot; rules.

If there is a sense in which a card game can have an &quot;official&quot; set of rules, it is when that card game has an &quot;official&quot; governing body. For example, the rules of tournament [[contract bridge|bridge]] are governed by the World Bridge Federation, and by local bodies in various countries such as the [[American Contract Bridge League]] in the U.S., and the [[English Bridge Union]] in England. The rules of [[Skat (card game)|skat]] are governed by  [[The International Skat Players Association]] and in [[Germany]]  by the [[Deutscher Skatverband]] which publishes the ''Skatordnung''. The rules of [[French tarot]] are governed by the [[Fédération Française de Tarot]]. The rules of [[Poker]]'s variants are largely traditional, but enforced by the [[World Series of Poker]] and the [[World Poker Tour]] organizations which sponsor tournament play. Even in these cases, the rules must only be followed exactly at games sanctioned by these governing bodies; players in less formal settings are free to implement agreed-upon supplemental or substitute rules at will.

===Rule infractions===
An infraction is any action which is against the rules of the game, such as playing a card when it is not one's turn to play or the accidental exposure of a card. 

In many official sets of rules for card games, the rules specifying the penalties for various infractions occupy more pages than the rules specifying how to play correctly. This is tedious, but necessary for games that are played seriously. Players who intend to play a card game at a high level generally ensure before beginning that all agree on the penalties to be used. When playing privately, this will normally be a question of agreeing house rules. In a tournament there will probably be a tournament director who will enforce the rules when required and arbitrate in cases of doubt. 

If a player breaks the rules of a game deliberately, this is cheating. Most card players would refuse to play cards with a known cheat. The rest of this section is therefore about accidental infractions, caused by ignorance, clumsiness, inattention, etc. 

As the same game is played repeatedly among a group of players, precedents build up about how a particular infraction of the rules should be handled. For example, &quot;Sheila just led a card when it wasn't her turn. Last week when Jo did that, we agreed ... etc.&quot; Sets of such precedents tend to become established among groups of players, and to be regarded as part of the house rules. Sets of house rules become formalized, as described in the previous section. Therefore, for some games, there is a &quot;proper&quot; way of handling infractions of the rules. But for many games, without governing bodies, there is no standard way of handling infractions. 

In many circumstances, there is no need for special rules dealing with what happens after an infraction. As a general principle, the person who broke a rule should not benefit by it, and the other players should not lose by it. An exception to this may be made in games with fixed partnerships, in which it may be felt that the partner(s) of the person who broke a rule should also not benefit. The penalty for an accidental infraction should be as mild as reasonable, consistent with there being no possible benefit to the person responsible.

==Types==
===Trick-taking games===
{{See also|List of trick-taking games}}
The object of a [[trick-taking game]] is based on the play of multiple rounds, or tricks, in each of which each player plays a single card from their hand, and based on the values of played cards one player wins or &quot;takes&quot; the trick. The specific object varies with each game and can include taking as many tricks as possible, taking as many scoring cards (or as few penalty cards) within the tricks won as possible, taking as few tricks as possible, or taking an exact number of tricks. [[Contract bridge|Bridge]], [[Whist]], [[Euchre]], [[Spades]], [[Hearts (card game)|Hearts]], [[Twenty-eight (card game)|Twenty-eight]] or Twenty Nine and the various [[Tarot card games]] are popular examples.

===Matching games===
{{see also|Category:Matching card games}}
The object of [[Rummy]], and various other melding or matching games, is to acquire the required groups of matching cards before an opponent can do so. In [[Rummy]], this is done through drawing and discarding, and the groups are called melds. [[Mahjong]] is a very similar game played with tiles instead of cards. Non-Rummy examples of match-type games generally fall into the &quot;fishing&quot; genre and include the children's games [[Go Fish]] and [[Old Maid]].

===Shedding games===
{{see also|Category:Shedding-type card games}}
In a [[Shedding-type game|shedding game]], players start with a hand of cards, and the object of the game is to be the first player to discard all cards from one's hand. Some matching-type games are also shedding-type games; some variants of Rummy such as ''[[Phase 10]]'' and ''[[Rummikub]]'', as well as the children's game [[Old Maid]], fall into both categories.

===Accumulating games===
{{see also|Category:Accumulating-type card games}}
The object of an accumulating game is to acquire all cards in the deck. Examples include most [[War (card game)|War]] type games, and games involving slapping a discard pile. [[Egyptian War]] has both of these features.

===Fishing games===
{{see also|Category:Fishing card games}}
In fishing games, cards from the hand are played against cards in a layout on the table, capturing table cards if they match.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pagat.com/fishing/ Pagat.com]&lt;/ref&gt;  Fishing games are popular in many nations, including China, where there are many diverse fishing games.  [[Scopa]] is considered one of the national card games of Italy.  [[Cassino (card game)|Cassino]] is the only fishing game to be widely played in English-speaking countries.

===Comparing games===
{{see also|Category:Comparing card games}}
Comparing card games are those where hand values are compared to determine the winner, also known as &quot;vying&quot; or &quot;showdown&quot; games. [[Poker]], [[blackjack]], and [[baccarat]] are examples of comparing card games.

===Solitaire (Patience) games===
Solitaire games are designed to be played by one player. Most games begin with a specific layout of cards, called a tableau, and the object is then either to construct a more elaborate final layout, or to clear the tableau and/or the draw pile or ''stock'' by moving all cards to one or more &quot;discard&quot; or &quot;foundation&quot; piles.
{{See also|Solitaire|Category:Solitaire card games}}

===Drinking card games===
{{See also|Category:Drinking card games}}
Drinking card games are, true to their name, a subset of [[drinking game]]s using cards, in which the object in playing the game is either to drink or to force others to drink. Many games are simply ordinary card games with the establishment of &quot;drinking rules&quot;; [[Asshole (game)|Asshole (Presidents)]], for instance, is virtually identical to [[Daihinmin]] but with additional rules governing drinking. Poker can also be played using a number of drinks as the wager. Some card games are designed specifically to be played as drinking games.

===Multi-genre games===
Many games borrow elements from more than one type of game. The most common combination is that of matching and shedding, as in some variants of Rummy, [[Old Maid]] and [[Go Fish]]. However, many multi-genre games involve different stages of play for each hand. The most common multi-stage combination is a &quot;trick-and-meld&quot; game, such as [[Pinochle]] or [[Belote]]. Other multi-stage, multi-genre games include [[Poke (game)|Poke]], [[Flaps Card Game|Flaps]], [[Skitgubbe]] and [[Tichu]].  Vici is an example of a multi-genre card game which combines elements of 5-card hands and bluffing techniques from poker, with gathering and matching strategies from rummy and certain partnering aspects from bridge.

===Collectible card games (CCGs)===
{{see also|Collectible card game|List of collectible card games|Category:Collectible card games}}
Collectible card games are defined by the use of decks of proprietary cards that differ between players. The contents of these decks are a subset of a very large pool of available cards which have differing effects, costs, and art. A player accumulates his or her deck through purchase or trade for desirable cards, and each player uses their own deck to play against the other. ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh!]]'', ''[[Magic: The Gathering]]'' and ''[[Pk cards]]'' are well-known collectible card games. Such games are also created to capitalize on the popularity of other forms of entertainment, such as ''[[Pokémon]]'' and ''[[Marvel Comics]]'' which both have had CCGs created around them.

===Casino or gambling card games===
{{See also|casino|gambling}}
These games revolve around wagers of money. Though virtually any game in which there are winning and losing outcomes can be wagered on, these games are specifically designed to make the betting process a strategic part of the game. Some of these games involve players betting against each other, such as poker, while in others, like [[blackjack]], players wager against the house.

====Poker games====
{{see also|List of poker variants|Category:Poker variants}}
Poker is a family of gambling games in which players bet into a pool, called the pot, that the value of their hand will beat all others according to the [[list of poker hands|ranking system]]. Variants largely differ on how cards are dealt and the methods by which players can improve a hand. For many reasons, including its age and its popularity among Western militaries, it is one of the most universally known card games in existence.

===Other card games===
{{see also|Category:Dedicated deck card games}}
Many other card games have been designed and published on a commercial or amateur basis. In some cases, the game uses the standard 52-card deck, but the object is unique. In [[Eleusis (game)|Eleusis]], for example, players play single cards, and are told whether the play was legal or illegal, in an attempt to discover the underlying rules made up by the dealer. 

Most of these games however typically use a specially made deck of cards designed specifically for the game (or variations of it). The decks are thus usually proprietary, but may be created by the game's players.

===Fictional card games===
{{see also|List of fictional games#Card games}}
Many games, including card games, are fabricated by [[science fiction]] authors and screenwriters to distance a culture depicted in the story from present-day Western culture. They are commonly used as filler to depict background activities in an atmosphere like a bar or rec room, but sometimes the drama revolves around the play of the game. Some of these games, such as Pyramid from ''[[Battlestar Galactica (1978 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]'', become real card games as the holder of the intellectual property develops and markets a suitable deck and ruleset for the game, while others, such as &quot;Exploding Snap&quot; from the [[Harry Potter]] franchise, lack sufficient descriptions of rules, or depend on cards or other hardware that are infeasible or physically impossible.

      <text xml:space="preserve">:''This article is about the embroidery style called cross-stitch or counted cross-stitch.  For specific crossed stitches used in needlework, see'' [[cross stitches]].
[[Image:Stickmuster 1735.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Cross-stitch [[Sampler (needlework)|sampler]], [[Germany]], 1735.]]
'''Cross-stitch''' is a popular form of [[counted-thread embroidery|counted-thread]] [[embroidery]] in which X-shaped stitches in a tiled, [[raster graphics|raster-like]] pattern are used to form a picture. Cross-stitch is usually executed on easily countable evenweave fabric called [[aida cloth]]. The stitcher counts the threads in each direction so that the stitches are of uniform size and appearance. This form of cross-stitch is also called '''counted cross-stitch''' in order to distinguish it from other forms of cross-stitch. Sometimes cross-stitch is done on designs printed on the fabric ('''stamped cross-stitch'''); the stitcher simply stitches over the printed pattern.

==History==
[[Image:Cross stitch detail.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Detail of floral border pattern in cotton. Tea cloth (small tablecloth), [[Hungary]], mid-twentieth century]]

Cross-stitch is one of the oldest forms of embroidery and can be found all over the world.&lt;ref&gt;Gillow, John, and Bryan Sentance: ''World Textiles'', Bulfinch Press/Little, Brown, 1999, ISBN 0-8212-2621-5, p. 181&lt;/ref&gt; Many folk museums show examples of clothing decorated with cross-stitch, especially from continental [[Europe]] and [[Asia]].

Two-dimensional (unshaded) cross-stitch in floral and geometric patterns, usually worked in black and red cotton floss on linen, is characteristic of folk embroidery in [[Eastern Europe|Eastern]] and [[Central Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;''Threads'' (magazine), Issue 11, June/July 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the earliest known cross-stitch sampler is currently housed at [[Pilgrim Hall]] in [[Plymouth, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pilgrimhall.org/s_sampler.htm Loara Standish Sampler&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The sampler was created by Loara Standish,  daughter of Captain [[Myles Standish]] and pioneer of the Leviathan stitch, circa 1653.

Multicoloured, shaded, painting-like patterns as we know them today are a recent development, deriving from similar shaded patterns of [[Berlin wool work]] of the mid-nineteenth century.

Traditionally, cross-stitch was used to embellish items like dishcloths, household linens, and [[doilies]] (only a small portion of which would actually be embroidered, such as a border). Although there are many cross-stitchers who still employ it in this fashion, especially in Europe, it is now increasingly popular to simply embroider pieces of fabric and hang them on the wall for decoration. 

There are many cross-stitching &quot;[[guilds]]&quot; across the United States and Europe which offer classes, collaborate on large projects, stitch for charity, and provide other ways for local cross-stitchers to get to know one another.

Today cotton floss is the most common embroidery thread. It is a thread made of [[mercerized cotton]], composed of six strands that are only loosely twisted together and easily separable. Other materials used are pearl cotton, Danish flower thread, [[silk]] and  [[Rayon]]. Sometimes different wool threads, metallic threads or other speciality threads are used, sometimes for the whole work, sometimes for accents and embellishments. Hand dyed cross stitch floss is created just as the name implies - it is dyed by hand. Because of this, there are variations in the amount of color throughout the thread. Some variations can be subtle, while some can be a huge contrast. Some also have more than one color per thread, which in the right project, creates amazing results.

==Related stitches and forms of embroidery==

[[Image:Ukrainian girls.jpg|thumb|right|Ukrainian girls in traditional embroidered costumes]]
{{main|cross stitches}}
Other stitches are also often used in cross-stitch, among them ¼, ½, and ¾ stitches and backstitches. 

Cross-stitch is often used together with other stitches.  a cross stich can come in a variety of prostational forms It is sometimes used in [[crewel embroidery]], especially in its more modern derivatives. It is also often used in [[needlepoint]].

A specialized historical form of embroidery using cross-stitch is [[Assisi embroidery]].

There are many stitches which are related to cross-stitch and were used in similar ways in earlier times. The best known are Italian cross-stitch, [[Celtic Cross Stitch]], [[Irish Cross Stitch]], long-armed cross-stitch, Ukrainian cross-stitch and Montenegrin stitch. Italian cross-stitch and Montenegrin stitch are reversible, meaning the work looks the same on both sides. These styles have a slightly different look than ordinary cross-stitch. These more difficult stitches are rarely used in mainstream embroidery, but they are still used to recreate historical pieces of embroidery or by the creative and adventurous stitcher. 

The double cross-stitch, also known as a Leviathan stitch or Smyrna cross stitch, combines a cross-stitch with an upright cross-stitch.

[[Berlin wool work]] and similar [[petit point]] stitchery resembles the heavily shaded, opulent styles of cross-stitch, and sometimes also used charted patterns on paper.

Cross-stitch is often combined with other popular forms of embroidery, such as [[Hardanger embroidery]] or [[blackwork embroidery]]. Cross-stitch may also be combined with other work, such as [[canvaswork]] or [[drawn thread work]]. [[Beadwork]] and other embellishments such as paillettes, charms, small buttons and speciality threads of various kinds may also be used.

A recent style of contemporary cross stitch is termed urban cross stitch, which uses retro images or contemporary sayings designed to shock or rebel against the traditional image of cross stitching.

==Recent trends in the UK==
Cross-stitch has become increasingly popular with the younger generation of the [[United Kingdom]] in recent years&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crossstitchermagazine.co.uk/page/crossstitch?entry=the_manbroidering_revolution Cross Stitcher&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;. The [[recession of 2008|recession of post-2008]] has also seen renewal of interest in home crafts. Retailers such as [[John Lewis (department store)|John Lewis]] experienced a 17% rise in sales of haberdashery products between 2009 and 2010&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/8224494.stm BBC NEWS | Business | The modern 'make do and mend'&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;. [[Hobbycraft]], a chain of stores selling craft supplies, also enjoyed an 11% increase in sales over the past year&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/retailandconsumer/7020201/Hobbycraft-sews-up-strong-sales.html Hobbycraft sews up strong sales - Telegraph&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;. The chain is said{{by whom|date=March 2011}} to have benefited from the &quot;make do and mend&quot; mentality of the credit crisis, which has driven people to make their own cards and gifts.

[[Knitting]] and cross stitching have become more popular hobbies for a younger market, in contrast to its traditional reputation as a hobby for retirees&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2006/may/29/gender Eithne Farry on the women who are making sewing subversive | Life and style | The Guardian&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;. Sewing and craft groups such as [[Stitch and Bitch London]] have resurrected the idea of the traditional craft club&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iknit.org.uk/stitchnbitchday.html I Knit London, the UK's First Official Stitch 'n Bitch Day&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;. At [[Clothes Show Live]] 2010 there was a new area called &quot;Sknitch&quot; promoting modern sewing, knitting and embroidery&lt;ref&gt;http://www.clothesshowlive.com/sknitch&lt;/ref&gt;.

In a departure from the traditional designs associated with cross stitch, there is a current trend for more [[postmodern]] or tongue-in-cheek designs featuring retro images or contemporary sayings&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/features/article2440693.ece Why cross-stitch is achingly hip again | The Sun |Features&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;. It is linked to a concept known as 'subversive cross stitch', which involves more risque designs, often fusing the traditional sampler style with sayings designed to shock or be incongruous with the old-fashioned image of cross stitch.

{{distinguish|Cassino (card game)}}
[[Game]]s available in most [[casino]]s are commonly called '''casino games'''. In a casino game, the players [[gambling|gamble]] [[casino token|casino chips]] on various possible [[random]] outcomes or combinations of outcomes. Casino games are available in [[online casino]]s, where permitted by law.{{citation needed|date=May 2009}} Casino games can also be played outside of casinos for entertainment purposes, some on machines that simulate gambling.

==Categories of casino games==
There are three general categories of casino games: table games, [[slot machines|electronic gaming machines]], and random number ticket games such as [[Keno]] and simulated racing. Gaming machines, such as [[slot machine]]s and [[pachinko]], are usually played by one player at a time and do not require the involvement of casino employees to play. [[Random number]] games are based upon the selection of random numbers, either from a computerized [[random number generator]] or from other gaming equipment. Random number games may be played at a table, such as [[roulette]], or through the purchase of paper tickets or cards, such as [[keno]] or [[Bingo (U.S.)|bingo]].

==House advantage &lt;!-- Redirect target heading --&gt; ==
Casino games generally provide a predictable long-term advantage to the casino, or &quot;house&quot;, while offering the player the possibility of a large short-term payout. Some casino games have a skill element, where the player makes decisions; such games are called &quot;random with a tactical element&quot;. While it is possible through skillful play to minimize the house advantage, it is extremely rare that a player has sufficient skill to completely eliminate his inherent long-term disadvantage (the '''house edge''' (HE) or house [[vigorish]]) in a casino game. Such a skill set would involve years of training, an extraordinary memory and numeracy, and/or acute visual or even aural observation, as in the case of [[Eudaemons|wheel clocking]] in Roulette.

The player's disadvantage is a result of the casino not paying winning wagers according to the game's &quot;true odds&quot;, which are the payouts that would be expected considering the odds of a wager either winning or losing. For example, if a game is played by wagering on the number that would result from the roll of one die, true odds would be 6 times the amount wagered since there is a 1 in 6 chance of any single number appearing. However, the casino may only pay 5 times the amount wagered for a winning wager. 

The house edge or vigorish is defined as the casino profit expressed as a percentage of the player's original bet. (In games such as [[Blackjack]] or [[Spanish 21]], the final bet may be several times the original bet, if the player double and splits.) 

Example: In American [[Roulette]], there are two zeroes and 36 non-zero numbers (18 red and 18 black). If a player bets 1 unit on red, his chance of winning 1 unit is therefore 18/38 and his chance of losing 1 unit (or winning -1) is 20/38. 

The player's expected value, EV = (18/38 x 1) + (20/38 x -1) = 18/38 - 20/38 = -2/38 = -5.26%. Therefore, the house edge is 5.26%. After 10 rounds, play 1 per round, the average house profit will be 10 x 1 x 5.26% = 0.53. Of course, it is not possible for the casino to win exactly 53 cents; this figure is the average casino profit from each player if it had millions of players each betting 10 rounds at 1 unit per round.

The house edge of casino games vary greatly with the game. [[Keno]] can have house edges up to 25%, slot machines can have up to 15%, while most [[Pontoon (card game)|Australian Pontoon]] games have house edges between 0.3% and 0.4%.

The calculation of the Roulette house edge was a trivial exercise; for other games, this is not usually the case. Combinatorial analysis and/or computer simulation is necessary to complete the task.

In games which have a skill element, such as [[Blackjack]] or [[Spanish 21]], the house edge is defined as the house advantage from optimal play (without the use of advanced techniques such as [[card counting]]), on the first hand of the shoe (the container that holds the cards). The set of the optimal plays for all possible hands is known as &quot;[[Blackjack#Basic_strategy|basic strategy]]&quot; and is highly dependent on the specific rules, and even the number of decks used. Good [[Blackjack]] and [[Spanish 21]] games have house edges below 0.5%.

===Standard deviation===
The luck factor in a casino game is quantified using [[standard deviations]] (SD). The standard deviation of a simple game like Roulette can be calculated using the [[binomial distribution]]. In the binomial distribution, SD = sqrt (''npq'' ), where ''n'' = number of rounds played, ''p'' = probability of winning, and ''q'' = probability of losing. The binomial distribution assumes a result of 1 unit for a win, and 0 units for a loss, rather than -1 units for a loss, which doubles the range of possible outcomes. Furthermore, if we flat bet at 10 units per round instead of 1 unit, the range of possible outcomes increases 10 fold. 

SD (Roulette, even-money bet) = 2''b'' sqrt(''npq'' ), where ''b'' = flat bet per round, ''n'' = number of rounds, ''p'' = 18/38, and ''q'' = 20/38.

For example, after 10 rounds at 1 unit per round, the standard deviation will be 2 x 1 x sqrt(10 x 18/38 x 20/38) = 3.16 units. After 10 rounds, the expected loss will be 10 x 1 x 5.26% = 0.53. As you can see, standard deviation is many times the magnitude of the expected loss. 

The standard deviation for [[Pai Gow poker]] is the lowest out of all common casinos. Many, particularly slots, have extremely high standard deviations. As the size of the potential payouts increase, so does the standard deviation.

As the number of rounds increases, eventually, the expected loss will exceed the standard deviation, many times over. From the formula, we can see the standard deviation is proportional to the square root of the number of rounds played, while the expected loss is proportional to the number of rounds played. As the number of rounds increases, the expected loss increases at a much faster rate. This is why it is impossible for a gambler to win in the long term. It is the high ratio of short-term standard deviation to expected loss that fools gamblers into thinking that they can win. 

It is important for a casino to know both the house edge and variance for all of their games. The house edge tells them what kind of profit they will make as percentage of turnover, and the variance tells them how much they need in the way of cash reserves. The mathematicians and computer programmers that do this kind of work are called [[gaming mathematics|gaming mathematicians]] and gaming analysts. Casinos do not have in-house expertise in this field, so outsource their requirements to experts in the gaming analysis field, such as [[Michael Shackleford|Mike Shackleford]], the &quot;Wizard of Odds&quot;.

{{Video Games}}

A '''video game''' is an [[electronic game]] that involves interaction with a [[user interface]] to generate visual feedback on a [[video|video device]]. The word ''video'' in ''video game'' traditionally referred to a [[raster graphics|raster]] display device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.freepatentsonline.com/3659285.html |title= Television gaming apparatus and method | accessdate=2008-06-25 |work=
United States Patents }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, with the popular use of the term &quot;video game&quot;, it now implies any type of [[display device]]. The electronic systems used to play video games are known as platforms; examples of these are [[personal computer]]s and [[video game console]]s. These platforms range from large [[mainframe computer]]s to small [[handheld device]]s. Specialized video games such as [[arcade game]]s, while previously common, have gradually declined in use.

The [[input device]] used to manipulate video games is called a [[game controller]], and varies across platforms. For example, a dedicated console controller might consist of only a button and a [[joystick]]. Another may feature a dozen buttons and one or more joysticks. Early personal computer games often needed a [[computer keyboard|keyboard]] for [[gameplay]], or more commonly, required the user to buy a separate joystick with at least one button.&lt;ref&gt;*Patrick Stack. [http://www.time.com/time/covers/1101050523/console_timeline &quot;History of video game consoles&quot;] ''Time Magazine website'' 2005 &lt;!-- accessed August 23, 2009 --&gt;/&lt;/ref&gt; Many modern computer games allow, or even require, the player to use a keyboard and [[Mouse (computing)|mouse]] simultaneously.

Video games typically also use other ways of providing interaction and information to the player. Audio is almost universal, using [[Sound recording and reproduction|sound reproduction]] devices, such as [[Computer speaker|speakers]] and [[headphones]]. Other feedback may come via [[haptic technology|haptic]] [[peripheral]]s, such as vibration or [[force feedback]], with vibration sometimes used to simulate force feedback.

==History==
{{Main|History of video games}}
{{See also|First video game}}

[[File:Tennis for Two.jpg|right|thumb|256px|''Tennis for Two'', an early [[analog computer]] game that used an [[oscilloscope]] for a display]]

Early games used interactive electronic devices with various display formats. The earliest example is from 1947—a &quot;[[Cathode ray tube]] Amusement Device&quot; was filed for a patent on January 25, 1947, by [[Thomas T. Goldsmith Jr.]] and Estle Ray Mann, and issued on December 14, 1948, as U.S. Patent 2455992.&lt;ref&gt;{{US Patent|2455992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inspired by radar display tech, it consisted of an analog device that allowed a user to control a vector-drawn dot on the screen to simulate a missile being fired at targets, which were drawings fixed to the screen.&lt;ref name=&quot;PongStory&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.pong-story.com/intro.htm| title = Welcome to Pong-Story - Introduction| publisher = PONG-Story.com| accessdate = 2007-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other early examples include:

* The [[Nimrod (computing)|NIMROD]] computer at the 1951 [[Festival of Britain]]
* ''[[OXO]]'' a [[tic-tac-toe]] Computer game by [[A.S. Douglas|Alexander S. Douglas]] for the [[EDSAC]] in 1952
* ''[[Tennis for Two]]'', an interactive game engineered by [[William Higinbotham]] in 1958
* ''[[Spacewar!]]'', written by [[MIT]] students Martin Graetz, Steve Russell, and Wayne Wiitanen's on a DEC [[PDP-1]] computer in 1961.

Each game used different means of display: NIMROD used a panel of lights to play the game of [[Nim]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.goodeveca.net/nimrod/| title = Welcome to... NIMROD!| publisher = | accessdate = 2007-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; OXO used a graphical display to play tic-tac-toe &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=David |last=Winter |url=http://www.pong-story.com/1952.htm |title=A.S.Douglas' 1952 Noughts and Crosses game |publisher=PONG-Story |accessdate=2009-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Tennis for Two'' used an oscilloscope to display a side view of a tennis court,&lt;ref name=&quot;PongStory&quot;/&gt; and ''Spacewar!'' used the [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]]  PDP-1's vector display to have two [[spaceships]] battle each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Rabin| first= Steve| title= Introduction to Game Development| publisher= Charles River Media| location= Massachusetts| isbn=1-58450-377-7 |year= 2005| origyear= 2005-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971, ''[[Computer Space]]'', created by [[Nolan Bushnell]] and [[Ted Dabney]], was the first commercially sold, coin-operated video game. It used a black-and-white [[television]] for its display, and the computer system was made of [[7400 series|74 series]] [[Transistor-transistor logic|TTL]] [[integrated circuit|chips]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was featured in the 1973 science fiction film ''[[Soylent Green]]''. ''Computer Space'' was followed in 1972 by the [[Magnavox Odyssey]], the first home console. Modeled after a late 1960s prototype console developed by [[Ralph H. Baer]] called the &quot;Brown Box&quot;, it also used a standard television.&lt;ref name=&quot;PongStory&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Console Portraits: A 40-Year Pictorial History of Gaming| date = 2007-05-15| author = Orlando, Greg| url = http://www.wired.com/gaming/gamingreviews/multimedia/2007/05/gallery_game_history| publisher = [[Wired News]]| accessdate = 2007-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were followed by two versions of [[Atari, Inc.|Atari]]'s ''[[Pong]]''; an arcade version in 1972 and a home version in 1975.&lt;ref name=&quot;PBS-GameRev-Time&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title = History of Gaming - Interactive Timeline of Game History| url = http://www.pbs.org/kcts/videogamerevolution/history/timeline_flash.html| publisher = [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]| accessdate = 2007-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The commercial success of ''Pong'' led numerous other companies to develop ''Pong'' clones and their own systems, spawning the [[video game industry]].&lt;ref name=&quot;InformIT&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author = Miller, Michael| url = http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=378141| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071012152258/http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=378141| archivedate = 2007-10-12| title = A History of Home Video Game Consoles| publisher = [[InformIT]]| date = 2005-04-01| accessdate = 2007-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
===Platforms===
{{See also|History of video games}}

The term &quot;platform&quot; refers to the specific combination of electronic or computer [[hardware]] which, in conjunction with low-level software, allows a video game to operate.&lt;ref name=&quot;platformdef&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title =platform - Definitions from Dictionary.com | publisher =Dictionary.com | url =http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/platform | accessdate =2007-11-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term &quot;system&quot; is also commonly used. As well, newer video game platforms are also known as next &quot;gen&quot; consoles.

In common use a &quot;[[personal computer game|PC game]]&quot; refers to a form of media that involves a player interacting with a [[personal computer]] connected to a high-resolution [[video monitor]]. A &quot;[[console game]]&quot; is played on a specialized electronic device that connects to a common [[television set]] or [[Composite monitor|composite video monitor]]. A &quot;[[Handheld game console|handheld]]&quot; gaming device is a self contained electronic device that is portable and can be held in a user's hands. &quot;[[Arcade game]]&quot; generally refers to a game played on an even more specialized type of electronic device that is typically designed to play only one game and is encased in a special [[arcade cabinet|cabinet]]. These distinctions are not always clear and there may be games that bridge one or more platforms. There are also devices with screens which have the ability to play games but are not dedicated video game machines (examples are [[mobile phone]]s, [[PDA]]s and [[graphing calculator]]s).

===Genres===
{{Main|Video game genres}}

A video game, like most other forms of media, may be categorized into [[Video game genres|genres]] based on many factors such as method of game play, types of goals, art style and more. Because genres are dependent on content for definition, genres have changed and evolved as newer styles of video games have come into existence. Ever advancing technology and production values related to video game development have fostered more life-like and complex games which have in turn introduced or enhanced genre possibilities (e.g., virtual pets), pushed the boundaries of existing video gaming or in some cases add new possibilities in play (such as that seen with titles specifically designed for devices like Sony's [[PlayStation Eye|EyeToy]]). Some genres represent combinations of others, such as [[massively multiplayer online role-playing game]]s, or, more commonly, MMORPGs. It is also common to see higher level genre terms that are collective in nature across all other genres such as with action, music/rhythm or horror-themed video games.

===Classifications===
====Core games====

In general, discussion about video gaming in both the press and politics revolves around titles found in the core games classification; historically, consisting of video games developed for play on [[Personal computer game|personal computers]], dedicated [[video game console]]s or [[handheld game console]]s.

Core games are generally defined by their intensity, depth of play or scale of production involved in their creation and can include games across a wide spectrum of genres. For example the [[Bit.Trip]] series for WiiWare, the [[Fallout (series)|Fallout series]] for PC and console or [[LittleBigPlanet]] for the PS3, all fall within the core games classification. Core games are sometimes considered demanding in their gameplay and typically do not appeal to the casual gamer.

====Casual games====
{{Main|Casual game}}

Casual games derive their name from their ease of accessibility, simple to understand gameplay and quick to grasp rule sets. Additionally, casual games frequently support the ability to jump in and out of play on demand. Casual games as a format existed long before the term was coined and include video games such as Solitaire or Minesweeper which can commonly be found pre-installed with many versions of the [[Microsoft Windows]] operating system.

Examples of genres within this category are [[Video game genres#Casual gaming genres|hidden object]], match three, time management, tetris or many of the [[tower defense]] style games. Casual games are generally sold through online retailers such as [[PopCap Games|PopCap]], [[Zylom]] and [[GameHouse]] or provided for free play through [[web portal]]s such as [[Newgrounds]] or [[AddictingGames]].

While casual games are most commonly played on personal computers, cellphones or PDAs, they can also be found on many of the on-line console system download services (e.g., [[Xbox Live]], [[PlayStation Network]], or [[WiiWare]]).

====Serious games====
{{Main|Serious game}}

Serious games are games that are designed primarily to convey information or a learning experience of some sort to the player. Some serious games may even fail to qualify as a video game in the traditional sense of the term. Also, educational software does not typically fall under this category (e.g., [[touch typing]] tutors, language learning, etc.) and the primary distinction would appear to be based on the title's primary goal as well as target age demographics. As with the other categories, this description is more of a guideline than a rule.

Serious games are games generally made for reasons beyond simple entertainment and as with the core and casual games may include works from any given genre, although some such as [[exergaming|exergames]], [[educational game]]s, or [[propaganda]] games may have a higher representation in this group due to their subject matter. These games are typically designed to be played by professionals as part of a specific job or for skill set improvement. They can also be created to convey social-political awareness on a specific subject.

One of the longest running serious games franchises would be [[Microsoft Flight Simulator]] first published in 1982 under that name. The United States military uses virtual reality based simulations for training exercises,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://science.howstuffworks.com/virtual-military.htm |title= How Virtual Reality Military Applications Work | accessdate=2009-11-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as do a growing number of first responder roles (e.g., police, fire fighter, EMT).&lt;ref&gt;*Anne Derryberry, [http://www.adobe.com/resources/elearning/pdfs/serious_games_wp.pdf &quot;Definition of Serious games] ''Adobe.com'' August 2007 &lt;!-- accessed August 23, 2009 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; One example of a non-game environment utilized as a platform for serious game development would be the virtual world of [[Second Life]], which is currently used by several United States governmental departments (e.g., [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|NOAA]], [[NASA]], [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory|JPL]]), Universities (e.g., [[Ohio University]], [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]]) for educational and remote learning programs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.b-eye-network.com/view/4163 |title= Serious Games in Virtual Worlds: The Future of Enterprise Business Intelligence | accessdate=2009-11-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and businesses (e.g., [[IBM]], [[Cisco Systems]]) for meetings and training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.informationweek.com/blog/main/archives/2007/04/using_second_li_2.html |title= Using Second Life As A Business-To-Business Tool
 | accessdate=2009-11-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tactical media]] in video games plays a crucial role in making a statement or conveying a message on important relevant issues. This form of media allows for a broader audience to be able to receive and gain access to certain information that otherwise may not have reached such people. An example of tactical media in video games would be [[newsgame]]s. These are short games related to contemporary events designed to illustrate a point.&lt;ref name=&quot;DiGRA&quot;&gt;[http://www.wingchunsantacruz.com/gamesandart/research/newsgames-DiGRA2009.pdf &quot;Newsgames: Procedural Rhetoric meets Political Cartoons&quot; by Mike Treanor and Michael Mateas]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, TAKE ACTION games is a game studio collective that was co-founded by Susana Ruiz and has made very successful and powerful serious games. Some of these games include ''[[Darfur is Dying]]'', ''Finding Zoe'', and ''In The Balance''. All of these games bring awareness to important issues and events in an intelligent and well thought out manner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://takeactiongames.com/TAG/HOME.html TAKE ACTION games&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Educational games===

On September 23, 2009, U.S. President Barack Obama launched a campaign called &quot;Educate to Innovate&quot; aimed at improving the technological, mathematical, scientific and engineering abilities of American students. This campaign states that it plans to harness the power of interactive games to help achieve the goal of students excelling in these departments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whitehouse.gov/issues/education/educate-innovate Educate to Innovate | The White House&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/president-obama-launches-educate-innovate-campaign-excellence-science-technology-en President Obama Launches &quot;Educate to Innovate&quot; Campaign for Excellence in Science, Technology, Engineering &amp; Math (Stem) Education | The White House&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; This campaign has stemmed into many new and exciting opportunities for the video game realm and has contributed to many new competitions. Some of these competitions include the STEM NATIONAL VIDEO GAME COMPETITION and the [[Imagine Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/video-game-competitions-to-expand-stem-learning-in-the-united-states-71656557.html Video Game Competitions to Expand Stem Learning in the United States]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20080822015626/http://imaginecup.com/support/faq.aspx#Question1.1 Imagine Cup Student Competition - Support FAQ's&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these examples are events that bring a focus to relevant and important current issues that are able to be addressed in the sense of video games to educate and spread knowledge in a new form of media. www.NobelPrize.org uses games to entice the user to learn about information pertaining to the Nobel prize achievements while engaging in a fun to play video game.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nobelprize.org/educational/ Educational Games&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; There are many different types and styles of educational games all the way from counting to spelling to games for kids and games for adults. Some other games do not have any particular targeted audience in mind and intended to simply educate or inform whoever views or plays the game.

==Development==
{{Main|Game development}}
{{See also|Video game industry practices}}
[[Image:Virtual-camera-system.png|thumb||Developers use various tools to create video games, here an editor to fine tune the [[virtual camera system]].]]
Video game development and authorship, much like any other form of entertainment, is frequently a cross-disciplinary field. [[Video game developer]]s, as employees within this industry are commonly referred, primarily include [[game programmer|programmers]] and [[graphic design]]ers. Over the years this has expanded to include almost every type of skill that one might see prevalent in the creation of any movie or television program, including [[sound design]]ers, [[musician]]s, and other technicians; as well as skills that are specific to video games, such as the [[game designer]]. All of these are managed by [[game producer|producers]].

In the early days of the industry, it was more common for a single person to manage all of the roles needed to create a video game. As platforms have become more complex and powerful in the type of material they can present, larger teams have been needed to generate all of the art, programming, cinematography, and more. This is not to say that the age of the &quot;one-man shop&quot; is gone, as this is still sometimes found in the casual gaming and handheld markets,&lt;ref name=&quot;numberofdevs&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title =The Edge of Reason? | publisher =eurogamer.net | url =http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/the-edge-of-reason | accessdate =2009-11-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; where smaller games are prevalent due to technical limitations such as limited [[RAM]] or lack of dedicated 3D graphics rendering capabilities on the target platform (e.g., some cellphones and [[PDAs]]).{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

With the growth of the size of development teams in the industry, the problem of cost has increased. Development studios need to be able to pay their staff a competitive wage in order to attract and retain the best talent, while publishers are constantly looking to keep costs down in order to maintain profitability on their investment. Typically, a video game console development team can range in sizes of anywhere from 5 to 50 people, with some teams exceeding 100. In May 2009, one game project was reported to have a development staff of 450.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nowgamer.com/news/513/assassins-creed-ii-triples-size-of-dev-team &quot;Assassin's Creed II dev team triples in size&quot;], Christopher Reynolds, 18 May 2009, NOW Gamer.&lt;/ref&gt;  The growth of team size combined with greater pressure to get completed projects into the market to begin recouping production costs has led to a greater occurrence of missed deadlines and unfinished products.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

===Modifications===
{{Main|Mod (computer gaming)}}

Many games produced for the PC are designed such that technically oriented consumers can modify the game.  These [[mod (computer gaming)|mods]] can add an extra dimension of replayability and interest. Developers such as [[id Software]], [[Valve Software]], [[Crytek]], [[Bethesda Softworks|Bethesda]], [[Epic Games]] and [[Blizzard Entertainment]] ship their games with some of the development tools used to make the game, along with documentation to assist mod developers. The [[Internet]] provides an inexpensive medium to promote and distribute mods, and they may be a factor in the commercial success of some games.&lt;ref name=&quot;lombardi&quot;&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20080506004712/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1000484956 Hollywood Reporter interviewing Doug Lombardi, Quote: &quot;Mods absolutely helped us drive huge sales to 'Half-Life,{{' &quot;}}].&lt;/ref&gt; This allows for the kind of success seen by popular mods such as the ''[[Half-Life (video game)|Half-Life]]'' mod ''[[Counter-Strike]]''.

===Cheating===
{{Main|Cheating (video games)}}

Cheating in computer games may involve [[cheat codes]] and hidden spots implemented by the game developers,&lt;ref name=&quot;WashPost&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title = In Game World, Cheaters Proudly Prosper| url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/27/AR2006082701059.html| publisher = Washington Post| author = Vargas, Jose Antonio| date = 2006-08-28| accessdate = 2007-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;KonamiCode&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3108751&amp;did=1| title =  Cracking the Code: The Konami Code| publisher = [[1UP.com]]| author = 1UP Staff| accessdate = 2007-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; modification of game code by third parties,&lt;ref name=&quot;AboutCheatCodes&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title = Video Game Cheats and Codes - What Are Cheat Codes?| url = http://vgstrategies.about.com/od/faqglossary/a/WhatAreCheats.htm| publisher = [[About.com]]| author = Rybka, Jason| accessdate = 2007-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Why Use Cheats and Codes for Console and PC Games?| url = http://vgstrategies.about.com/od/basicgamingtipstricks/a/whyusecheats.htm| publisher = About.com| author = Rybka, Jason| accessdate = 2007-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; or players exploiting a software glitch. Modifications are facilitated by either [[cheat cartridge]] hardware or a software [[trainer (games)|trainer]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AboutCheatCodes&quot;/&gt; Cheats usually make the game [[Difficulty level|easier]] by providing an unlimited amount of some resource; for example  weapons, health, or ammunition; or perhaps the ability to walk through walls.&lt;ref name=&quot;KonamiCode&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AboutCheatCodes&quot;/&gt; Other cheats might give access to otherwise unplayable levels or provide unusual or amusing features, like altered game colors or other graphical appearances.

===Glitches===

[[File:UMK3 Fighter Glitch.png|thumb|190px|Example of a color glitch from the video game ''[[Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3]]'']]
{{Main|Glitch}}

Software errors not detected by software testers during development can find their way into released versions of computer and video games. This may happen because the glitch only occurs under unusual circumstances in the game, was deemed too minor to correct, or because the game development was hurried to meet a publication deadline. Glitches can range from minor graphical errors to serious bugs that can delete saved data or cause the game to malfunction. In some cases publishers will release updates (referred to as ''patches'') to repair glitches. Sometimes a glitch may be beneficial to the player, these are often referred to as [[Exploit (online gaming)|exploits]].

==Theory==
{{Main|Game studies}}

Although departments of computer science have been studying the technical aspects of video games for years, theories that examine games as an artistic medium are a relatively recent development in the humanities. The two most visible schools in this emerging field are [[ludology]] and [[narratology]]. Narrativists approach video games in the context of what [[Janet Murray]] calls &quot;Cyberdrama&quot;. That is to say, their major concern is with video games as a storytelling medium, one that arises out of interactive fiction. Murray puts video games in the context of the [[Holodeck]], a fictional piece of technology from ''[[Star Trek]]'', arguing for the video game as a medium in which we get to become another person, and to act out in another world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Murray | first = Janet | authorlink = Janet Murray | year = 1998 | title = Hamlet on the Holodeck | publisher = MIT Press | isbn = 0262631873}}&lt;/ref&gt; This image of video games received early widespread popular support, and forms the basis of films such as ''[[Tron (film)|Tron]]'', ''[[eXistenZ]]'', and ''[[The Last Starfighter]]''.

Ludologists break sharply and radically from this idea. They argue that a video game is first and foremost a game, which must be understood in terms of its rules, interface, and the concept of play that it deploys. [[Espen J. Aarseth]] argues that, although games certainly have plots, characters, and aspects of traditional narratives, these aspects are incidental to gameplay. For example, Aarseth is critical of the widespread attention that narrativists have given to the heroine of the game ''[[Tomb Raider]]'', saying that &quot;the dimensions of [[Lara Croft]]'s body, already analyzed to death by [[film theory|film theorists]], are irrelevant to me as a player, because a different-looking body would not make me play differently... When I play, I don't even see her body, but see through it and past it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Aarseth| first = Espen J.| authorlink = Espen J. Aarseth|date=2004-05-21| url = http://www.electronicbookreview.com/thread/firstperson/vigilant| title = Genre Trouble| publisher = Electronic Book Review | accessdate = 2006-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simply put, ludologists reject traditional theories of art because they claim that the artistic and socially relevant qualities of a video game are primarily determined by the underlying set of rules, demands, and expectations imposed on the player.

While many games rely on [[Emergence|emergent principles]], video games commonly present simulated story worlds where emergent behavior occurs within the context of the game.  The term &quot;emergent narrative&quot; has been used to describe how, in a simulated environment, storyline can be created simply by &quot;what happens to the player.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://xbox.ign.com/articles/502/502409p1.html IGN: GDC 2004: Warren Spector Talks Games Narrative&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; However, emergent behavior is not limited to sophisticated games. In general, any place where event-driven instructions occur for [[AI]] in a game, emergent behavior will exist. For instance, take a racing game in which cars are programmed to avoid crashing, and they encounter an obstacle in the track: the cars might then maneuver to avoid the obstacle causing the cars behind them to slow and/or maneuver to accommodate the cars in front of them and the obstacle. The programmer never wrote code to specifically create a traffic jam, yet one now exists in the game.

==Social aspects==
===Demographics===

The November 2005 Nielsen Active Gamer Study, taking a survey of 2,000 regular gamers, found that the U.S. games market is diversifying. The age group among male players has expanded significantly up into the 25–40 age group. For casual online puzzle-style and simple mobile [[cell phone]] games, the gender divide is more or less equal between males and females. Females have also been found to show an attraction to online multi-player games where there is a communal experience.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} More recently there has been a growing segment of female players engaged with the aggressive style of games historically considered to fall within traditionally male genres (e.g., [[first-person shooter]]s). According to the ESRB almost 41% of PC gamers are women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Guy, Hannah |year=2007 | url = http://www.pcworld.ca/news/column/a7fe9b8a0a010408019ac931643ebf2c/pg0.htm | title = Women video gamers: Not just solitaire |archiveurl= http://www.asiancanadian.net/2007/03/women-video-gamers-not-just-solitaire.html |archivedate= 2007-03-12 |publisher= ''[[PC World (magazine)|PC World]]'' [[Canada]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When comparing today's industry climate with that of 20 years ago, women and many adults are more inclined to be using products in the industry. While the market for teen and young adult men is still a strong market, it is the other demographics which are posting significant growth. In 2008, the average American gamer has been playing for 12 years, and is now, on average, 35 years of age.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibisworld.com/industry/default.aspx?indid=2003 ''US Video Games Industry Report&quot;] IBISWorld, August 2008''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multiplayer===
{{Main|Multiplayer video game}}

Video gaming has traditionally been a social experience. [[Multiplayer game|Multiplayer video games]] are those that can be played either competitively, sometimes in [[Electronic Sports]], or cooperatively by using either multiple input devices, or by [[Hotseat (multiplayer mode)|hotseating]]. ''[[Tennis for Two]]'', arguably the first video game, was a two player game, as was its successor ''[[Pong]]''. The first commercially available game console, the [[Magnavox Odyssey]], had two controller inputs.

Since then, most consoles have been shipped with two or four controller inputs. Some have had the ability to expand to four, eight or as many as twelve inputs with additional adapters, such as the [[Multitap]]. Multiplayer [[arcade game]]s typically feature play for two to four players, sometimes tilting the monitor on its back for a top-down viewing experience allowing players to sit opposite one another.

Many early computer games for non-PC descendant based platforms featured multiplayer support. Personal computer systems from [[Atari]] and [[Commodore International|Commodore]] both regularly featured at least two game ports. PC-based computer games started with a lower availability of multiplayer options because of technical limitations. PCs typically had either one or no game ports at all. Network games for these early personal computers were generally limited to only text based adventures or [[MUD]]s that were played remotely on a dedicated server. This was due both to the slow speed of modems (300-1200-bit/s), and the prohibitive cost involved with putting a computer online in such a way where multiple visitors could make use of it. However, with the advent of widespread [[local area network]]ing technologies and Internet based online capabilities, the number of players in modern games can be 32 or higher, sometimes featuring integrated text and/or voice chat. [[Massively multiplayer online game|MMOs]] can offer extremely high numbers of simultaneous players; ''[[Eve Online]]'' set a record with 54,446 players on a single server in 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;MMORPGdotCOMReport32955PCU&quot;&gt;[http://www.strategyinformer.com/news/6545/ccp-reveals-new-eve-online-record-with-54446-concurrent-users CCP reveals new EVE Online record with 54,446 concurrent users]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Benefits===
{{Main|Video game behavioral effects}}

It has been shown that action video game players have better [[hand-eye coordination]] and [[Motor coordination|visuo-motor skill]]s, such as their resistance to [[distraction]], their sensitivity to information in the [[peripheral vision]] and their ability to count briefly presented objects, than nonplayers.&lt;ref&gt;

Researchers found that such enhanced abilities could be acquired by training with action games, involving challenges that switch attention between different locations, but not with games requiring concentration on single objects.
It has been suggested by a few studies that online/offline video gaming can be used as a therapeutic tool in the treatment of different mental health concerns.{{Which?|date=August 2009}}

In [[Steven Berlin Johnson|Steven Johnson]]'s book, ''[[Everything Bad Is Good for You]]'', he argues that video games in fact demand far more from a player than traditional games like ''[[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]]''. To experience the game, the player must first determine the objectives, as well as how to complete them. They must then learn the game controls and how the human-machine interface works, including menus and [[HUD (computer gaming)|HUDs]]. Beyond such skills, which after some time become quite fundamental and are taken for granted by many gamers, video games are based upon the player navigating (and eventually mastering) a highly complex system with many variables. This requires a strong analytical ability, as well as flexibility and adaptability. He argues that the process of learning the boundaries, goals, and controls of a given game is often a highly demanding one that calls on many different areas of cognitive function. Indeed, most games require a great deal of patience and focus from the player, and, contrary to the popular perception that games provide instant gratification, games actually delay gratification far longer than other forms of entertainment such as film or even many books.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2005/05/16/050516crbo_books Brain Candy: The New Yorker&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Some research suggests video games may even increase players' attention capacities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Daphne Bavelier ''et al.'' | year = 2003 | url = http://www.bcs.rochester.edu/people/daphne/GreenandBavelier.pdf | title = Action video game modifies visual selective attention | publisher = Nature/University of Rochester | accessdate = April 29, 2006 |format=PDF |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060329174957/http://www.bcs.rochester.edu/people/daphne/GreenandBavelier.pdf |archivedate = March 29, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Learning principles found in video games have been identified as possible techniques with which to reform the U.S. education system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Gee | first = James Paul | title = What Video Games Have to Teach us About Literacy and Learning | publisher = Palgrave Macmillan | year = 2003 | isbn = 1403961697 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been noticed that gamers adopt an attitude while playing that is of such high concentration, they do not realize they are learning, and that if the same attitude could be adopted at school, education would enjoy significant benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = James Paul Gee ''et al.'' | year = 2007 | url = http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/11.05/view.html | title = Wired 11.05: View | publisher = Codenet, Inc. | accessdate = December 4, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Students are found to be &quot;learning by doing&quot; while playing video games while fostering creative thinking.&lt;ref&gt;

According to research discussed at the 2008 Convention of the American Psychological Association, certain types of video games can improve the gamers' [[dexterity]] as well as their ability to problem-solve. A study of 33 laparoscopic surgeons found that those who played video games were 27 percent faster at advanced surgical procedures and made 37 percent fewer errors compared to those who did not play video games. A second study of 303 laparoscopic surgeons (82 percent men; 18 percent women) also showed that surgeons who played video games requiring spatial skills and hand dexterity and then performed a drill testing these skills were significantly faster at their first attempt and across all 10 trials than the surgeons who did not play the video games first.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newswise.com/articles/view/543366/ Playing Video Games Offers Learning Across Life Span] Newswise, Retrieved on August 17, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whilst many studies have detected superior mental aptitudes amongst habitual gamers, research by Walter Boot at the University of Illinois found that non-gamers showed no improvement in memory or multitasking abilities after 20 hours of playing three different games. The researchers suggested that &quot;individuals with superior abilities are more likely to choose video gaming as an activity in the first place&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=New Scientist|title=One less excuse to play video games|date=November 1, 2008|issue=2680|page=23|publisher=Reed Business Information|url=http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20026805.700-video-games-dont-train-your-brain.html|accessdate = 2008-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversy===
{{Main|Video game controversy}}

Like related forms of media, computer and video games have been the subject of frequent controversy and [[censorship]], due to the depiction of graphic [[violence]], [[Sex|sexual themes]], [[advergaming]] (a form of [[advertising]] in games), consumption of [[Recreational drug use|drugs]], consumption of [[Alcoholic beverage|alcohol]] or [[tobacco]], [[propaganda]], or [[profanity]] in some games. Among others, critics of video games often include parents' groups, [[politician]]s, organized [[religious]] groups, and other [[advocacy group]]s, even though all of these can be found in all forms of entertainment and media. Various games have been accused of causing [[video game addiction|addiction]] and even violent behavior, though how much ground this holds is debatable. &quot;Video game censorship&quot; is defined as the use of state or group power to control the playing, distribution, purchase, or sale of video games or computer games. Video game controversy comes in many forms, and censorship is a controversial subject. Proponents and opponents of censorship are often very passionate about their individual views.

Various national content rating organizations, such as the [[Entertainment Software Ratings Board]] or ESRB in North America, rate software for certain age groups and with certain content warnings. Some of these organizations are optional industry self-regulation (such as the ESRB), while others are part of national government censorship organizations. Most video games display their rating on the front side of their packaging. However, parents are not always aware of the existence of these ratings. Not all ratings are considered accurate. Organizations such as ''What They Play'' and ''Common Sense Media'' aim to provide guidance and advice for parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher = Console Watcher | year = 2006 | url = http://www.consolewatcher.com/2006/01/grand-theft-auto-makers-sued-by-la-attorney-for-hidden-porn/ | title = Grand Theft Auto Makers Sued By LA Attorney For Hidden Porn | accessdate = October 26, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Game sales===
{{See also|List of best-selling video games}}

[[File:Videogameretaildisplay.jpg|thumb|220px|A typical retail display (in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]]) with a large selection of games for several major consoles]]

The three largest producers of and markets for computer and video games (in order) are [[North America]] (US and Canada), [[Japan]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. Other significant markets include [[Australia]], [[Spain]], [[Germany]], [[South Korea]], [[Mexico]], [[France]] and [[Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20080624233600/http://www.elspa.com/assets/files/c/computerandvideogamesabritishphenomenonaroundthewo_174.pdf Computer And Video Games: A British Phenomena Around the World] ([[Portable Document Format|PDF]])&lt;/ref&gt;  Both [[India]] and [[People's Republic of China|China]] are considered emerging markets in the video game industry and sales are expected to rise significantly in the coming years. [[Ireland|Irish]] are the largest per capita consumers of video games.&lt;ref&gt;Global Entertainment and Media Outlook:2009-2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Sales of different types of games vary widely between these markets due to local preferences. Japanese consumers tend to purchase console games over computer games, with a strong preference for games catering to local tastes. In South Korea, computer games are preferred, especially [[Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|MMORPG]] games and [[real-time strategy]] games. There are over 20,000 [[Internet café]]s in South Korea where computer games can be played for an hourly charge.

The [[NPD Group]] tracks computer and video game sales in the United States. It reported in 2004 that:

* Console and portable software sales: $6.2&amp;nbsp;billion, up 8% from 2003&lt;ref name=&quot;sales&quot;&gt;{{cite web | date = January 18, 2005 | url = http://gameinfowire.com/news.asp?nid=5650 | title = U.S. video game industry sales dip in 2004 | publisher = Game Info Wire | accessdate = February 12, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Console and portable hardware and accessory sales: $3.7&amp;nbsp;billion, down 35% from 2003&lt;ref name=&quot;sales&quot; /&gt;
* PC game sales: $1.1&amp;nbsp;billion, down 15% from 2006&lt;ref name=&quot;ussales&quot;&gt;{{cite web|publisher = Entertainment Software Association (ESA)|year=2004|url=http://www.theesa.com/facts/salesandgenre.asp|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060208194822/http://www.theesa.com/facts/sales_genre_data.php|archivedate=8 February 2006|title=Sales &amp; Genre data|accessdate=12 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PC games that are [[digital distribution|digitally distributed]] either directly or by networks such as [[Steam (software)|Steam]] are not tracked by the NPD, and Steam does not list sales numbers for games downloaded through their service. [[Copyright infringement of software|Unauthorized distribution]] is also rampant on the PC.&lt;ref name=&quot;forbes&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=DiCarlo|first=Lisa|title =Do Game Publishers Ignore Piracy?|publisher=Forbes.com|date=18 July 2005|url=http://www.forbes.com/2005/07/18/videogame-piracy-worldwide-cx_ld_0718piracy.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080103014804/http://www.forbes.com/2005/07/18/videogame-piracy-worldwide-cx_ld_0718piracy.html|archivedate=2008-01-03|accessdate=29 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These figures are sales in dollars, not units, Unit shipments for each category were higher than the dollar sales numbers indicate, because more software and hardware was discounted than in 2003. But with the release of the next-generation consoles in 2006, these numbers increased dramatically. The game and film industries are also becoming increasingly intertwined, with companies like [[Sony]] having significant stakes in both. A large number of summer blockbuster films spawn a companion game, often launching at the same time to share the marketing costs.

The global market for console games has seen an average of 6.9 percent compound annual growth rate and is expected to become a $34.7 billion market in 2012.Online game sales are expected to grow at a larger rate of 16.9 percent, escalating from $6.6 billion in 2008 to $14.4 billion by 2012. The largest channel for growth, however, is in mobile gaming with a growth rate of 19 percent; growing from $5.6 billion to $13.5 billion in four years.&lt;ref name=&quot;digital media wire&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Bond|first=Paul|title=Video game sales on winning streak, study projects|publisher=reuters|date=2008-06-18|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2008/06/18/us-videogames-idUSN1840038320080618?pageNumber=1&amp;virtualBrandChannel=0|accessdate=2011-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism===

In [[Australia]], the [[United Kingdom]] and other [[PAL region]]s, generally when compared to the US, PAL gamers pay 40% to 50% more for the same product.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}. The reason for this is not due to the costs of translation, as English is the main language in Australia and the UK. The differences between PAL and [[NTSC]] are these days irrelevant; most video displays run at least 60[[Hertz|Hz]]. There is also a problem of [[regional lockout]] in Australia, as while most DVD players are sold [[DVD region code#Legal concerns|region-free]] to accommodate local consumer rights legislation,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/sinodisp/au/cases/cth/HCA/2005/58.html &quot;High Court of Australia enforcing region free&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; video game consoles are still sold fully region protected. Some effort has been made to increase awareness of the issue, specifically to [[Nintendo]] of Australia,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nintendo.com.au/ Nintendo Australia]&lt;/ref&gt; in the form of a formal report outlining the issues, published by Aaron Rex Davies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://homepages.ihug.co.nz/~aaronights/2007-8-11_report_into_software_releases.pdf &quot;Research report into excessive delays in release of Wii software by [[Nintendo]] in Australia and New Zealand regions&quot;] by Aaron Rex Davies ([[Portable Document Format|PDF]])&lt;/ref&gt; The report has gone on to gain a lot of attention in the public media.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aussie-nintendo.com/?v=news&amp;p=16776 &quot;Australia to Nintendo: Knock It Off&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Video game museums==
There are many video game museums around the world, for example Museum of Soviet Arcade Machines in [[Moscow]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.15kop.ru/en/ Museum of Soviet arcade machines]&lt;/ref&gt; or Computer Game Museum in [[Berlin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.computerspielemuseum.de/index.php?lg=en Computerspielemuseum - Berlin]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Cambrian''' is the first [[geological period]] of the [[Paleozoic]] Era, lasting from {{period span|Cambrian}} {{ICS 2004}}; it is succeeded by the [[Ordovician]].  Its subdivisions, and indeed its base, are somewhat in flux.  The period was established by [[Adam Sedgwick]], who named it after [[Cambria]], the [[Latin]] name for [[Wales]], where Britain's Cambrian rocks are best exposed.&lt;ref name=Sedgwick1852&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1144/GSL.JGS.1852.008.01-02.20|author=Sedgwick, A. |year=1852|title=On the classification and nomenclature of the Lower Paleozoic rocks of England and Wales|journal=Q. J. Geol. Soc. Land. |volume=8|pages=136–138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cambrian is unique in its unusually high proportion of [[lagerstätten]].  These are sites of exceptional preservation, where 'soft' parts of organisms are preserved as well as their more resistant shells.  This means that our understanding of the Cambrian biology surpasses that of some later periods.&lt;ref name=Orr2003&gt;{{cite doi|10.1130/G19193.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cambrian Period marked a profound change in [[life on Earth]]; prior to the Cambrian era, life was on the whole small and simple.  Complex organisms gradually became more common in the millions of years immediately preceding the Cambrian, but it was not until this period that mineralised&amp;nbsp;— hence readily fossilised&amp;nbsp;— organisms became common.&lt;ref name=Butterfield2007&gt;{{cite doi|10.1111/j.1475-4983.2006.00613.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This diversification of lifeforms was relatively rapid, and is termed the [[Cambrian explosion]].  This vast increase in diverse forms of life produced the first representatives of many modern phyla, representing the evolutionary stems of modern groups of species. While life prospered in the oceans, the land was barren&amp;nbsp;— with nothing more than a microbial 'crud' known as [[soil crust]] covering the land.  Apart from some tentative evidence suggesting that a few animals foundered around on land, most of the [[continent]]s resembled deserts spanning from horizon to horizon.  Shallow seas flanked the margins of several continents created during the breakup of the [[supercontinent]] [[Pannotia]]. The seas were relatively warm, and polar ice was absent for much of the era.

The United States [[Federal Geographic Data Committee]] uses a &quot;barred capital C&quot; character similar to the capital letter [[Ukrainian Ye]] ‹Є› to represent the Cambrian Period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

== Stratigraphy ==
{{See|Stratigraphy of the Cambrian}}
{{Include timeline}}
Despite the long recognition of its distinction from younger [[Ordovician]] rocks and older [[Precambrian]] rocks, it was not until 1994 that this time period was internationally ratified. The base of the Cambrian is defined on a complex assemblage of [[trace fossils]] known as the ''[[Treptichnus pedum]]'' assemblage.&lt;ref name=Knoll2004a&gt;A. Knoll, M. Walter, G. Narbonne, and N. Christie-Blick (2004) &quot;[http://www.stratigraphy.org/bak/ediacaran/Knoll_et_al_2004a.pdf The Ediacaran Period: A New Addition to the Geologic Time Scale.]&quot; Submitted on Behalf of the Terminal Proterozoic Subcommission of the International Commission on Stratigraphy.&lt;/ref&gt;
Nevertheless, the usage of ''Treptichnus pedum'', a reference ichnofossil for the lower boundary of the Cambrian, for the stratigraphic detection of this boundary is always risky because of occurrence of very similar trace fossils belonging to the Treptichnids group well below the ''T. pedum'' in [[Namibia]], [[Spain]] and [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]], and possibly, in the western [[USA]]. The stratigraphic range of ''T. pedum'' overlaps the range of the [[Ediacaran]] fossils in Namibia, and probably in Spain.&lt;ref name=Fedonkin2007&gt;M.A. Fedonkin, B.S.

=== Subdivisions {{anchor|Subdivisions}} ===
The Cambrian period follows the [[Ediacaran]] and is followed by the [[Ordovician]] period. The Cambrian is divided into four [[epoch (geology)|epochs]] or [[series (stratigraphy)|series]] and ten [[age (geology)|ages]] or [[stage (stratigraphy)|stages]]. Currently only two series and four stages are named and have a [[GSSP]].

Because the international stratigraphic subdivision is not yet complete, many local subdivisions are still widely used. In some of these subdivisions the Cambrian is divided into three epochs with locally differing names&amp;nbsp;— the [[Early Cambrian]] (Caerfai or Waucoban, {{period span|early cambrian}}), [[Middle Cambrian]] (St Davids or Albertian, {{period span|middle cambrian}}) and [[Furongian]] ({{period span|late cambrian}} ; also known as Late Cambrian, Merioneth or Croixan). Rocks of these epochs are referred to as belonging to the Lower, Middle, or Upper Cambrian.

[[Trilobite zones]] allow biostratigraphic correlation in the Cambrian.

Each of the local epochs is divided into several stages. The Cambrian is divided into several regional [[faunal stages]] of which the Russian-Kazakhian system is most used in international parlance:

=== Cambrian dating ===
[[Image:Archeocyathids.JPG|thumb|[[Archeocyathid]]s from the [[Poleta formation]] in the [[Death Valley]] area]]
The time range for the Cambrian has classically been thought to have been from about 570 [[annum|Mya]] to about 500 Mya. The lower boundary of the Cambrian was traditionally set at the earliest appearance of [[trilobite]]s and also unusual forms known as [[Archeocyatha|archeocyathids]] (literally 'ancient cup') that are thought to be the earliest sponges and also the first non-microbial [[reef]] builders.

The end of the period was eventually set at a fairly definite faunal change now identified as an [[extinction event]]. [[Fossil]] discoveries and [[radiometric dating]] in the last quarter of the 20th century have called these dates into question. Date inconsistencies as large as 20 [[Mega-annum|Mya]] are common between authors. Framing dates of ''ca.'' 545 to 490 Mya were proposed by the International Subcommission on Global Stratigraphy as recently as 2002.

A radiometric date from [[New Brunswick]] puts the end of the Lower Cambrian around 511 Mya. This leaves 21 Mya for the other two series/epochs of the Cambrian.

A more precise date of 542 ± 0.3 Mya for the extinction event at the beginning of the Cambrian has recently been submitted.&lt;ref name=Gradstein2004&gt;{{cite book
 | author = Gradstein, F.M.
 | coauthors = Ogg, J.G., Smith, A.G., others
 | year = 2004
 | title = A Geologic Time Scale 2004
 | publisher = Cambridge University Press
 | isbn = 
 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rationale for this precise dating is interesting in itself as an example of [[Paleontology|paleological]] [[deductive reasoning]]. Exactly at the Cambrian boundary there is a marked fall in the abundance of [[carbon-13]], a &quot;reverse spike&quot; that [[paleontologist]]s call an ''excursion''. It is so widespread that it is the best indicator of the position of the Precambrian-Cambrian boundary in [[stratigraphic]] sequences of roughly this age. One of the places that this well-established carbon-13 excursion occurs is in [[Oman]]. Amthor (2003) describes evidence from Oman that indicates the [[carbon]]-[[isotope]] excursion relates to a mass extinction: the disappearance of distinctive fossils from the [[Precambrian]] coincides exactly with the carbon-13 anomaly. Fortunately, in the Oman sequence, so too does a [[volcanic ash]] horizon from which [[zircon]]s provide a very precise age of 542 ± 0.3 Mya (calculated on the decay rate of [[uranium]] to [[lead]]). This new and precise date tallies with the less precise dates for the carbon-13 anomaly, derived from sequences in [[Siberia]] and [[Namibia]]. It is presented here as likely to become accepted as the definitive age for the start of the Phanerozoic eon, and thus the start of the Paleozoic era and the Cambrian period.

Soc.|issue=Special publication}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– the sea level was high, which led to large areas of the continents being flooded in warm, shallow seas ideal for thriving life.  The sea levels fluctuated somewhat, suggesting that there were 'ice ages', associated with pulses of expansion and contraction of a south polar [[ice cap]].&lt;ref name=p32009&gt;{{cite doi|10.1016/j.palaeo.2009.02.010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Cambrian period was, on the whole, rather warm, it was not entirely without glaciation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite doi|10.1016/j.palaeo.2009.11.009    }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fauna ==
{{Main| Cambrian explosion }}

The Cambrian marked a steep change in the diversity and composition of Earth's biosphere.  The incumbent [[Ediacaran biota]] suffered a mass extinction at the base of the period, which corresponds to an increase in the abundance and complexity of burrowing behaviour.  This behaviour had a [[Cambrian substrate revolution|profound and irreversible effect on the substrate]] which transformed the [[seabed]] [[ecosystem]]s. Before Cambrian, the sea floor was covered by [[microbial mat]]s. By the end of the period, burrowing animals had destroyed the mats through [[bioturbation]], and gradually turned the seabeds into what they are today. As a consequence, many of those organisms who were dependent on the mats went extinct, while the other species adapted to the changed environment who now offered new ecological niches.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencenews.org/view/feature/id/48630/title/As_the_worms_churn As the worms churn]&lt;/ref&gt;
Around the same time there was a seemingly rapid appearance of representatives of all the  mineralized [[phylum|phyla]].&lt;ref name=Landing2010&gt;{{Cite doi|10.1130/G30870.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many of these phyla were represented only by stem-group forms; and since mineralized phyla generally have a benthic origin, they may not be a good proxy for (more abundant) non-mineralized phyla.&lt;ref name=Budd2000&gt;{{BuddJensen2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also suggestions that some Cambrian organisms ventured onto land, producing the trace fossils ''[[Protichnites]]'' and ''[[Climactichnites]]''.

In contrast to later periods, the Cambrian fauna was somewhat restricted; free-floating organisms were rare, with the majority living on or close to the sea floor;&lt;ref name=Munnecke2010&gt;{{Cite doi|10.1016/j.palaeo.2010.08.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; and mineralizing animals were rarer than in future periods, in part due to the unfavourable ocean chemistry.&lt;ref name=Munnecke2010/&gt;  (Most Cambrian carbonates were formed by microbial or non-biological processes.)&lt;ref name=Munnecke2010/&gt;

Many modes of preservation are unique to the Cambrian period, resulting in an abundance of [[lagerstätte]]; see the list at the end of the article.

== Flora ==
Generally it is accepted that there were no [[land plants]] at this time, although it is likely that a microbial &quot;scum&quot; comprising [[fungi]], [[algae]], and possibly [[lichens]] covered the land.&lt;ref name=Gray1985&gt;{{cite journal

In [[metaphysics]] (in particular, [[ontology]]), the different kinds or ways of [[being]] are called '''categories of being''' or simply ''categories.'' To investigate the categories of being is to determine the most fundamental and the broadest [[class (philosophy)|class]]es of entities. A distinction between such categories, in making the categories or applying them, is called an '''ontological distinction'''.

==Categorical distinctions==
The common or dominant ways to view categories as of the end of the 20th century.
#via [[bundle theory]] as bundles of properties - categories reflect differences in these
#via peer-to-peer comparisons or [[dialectic]]s - categories are formed by conflict/debate
#via [[value theory]] as leading to specific ends - categories are formed by choosing ends
#via [[conceptual metaphor]]s as arising from characteristics of human [[cognition]] itself - categories are found via [[cognitive science]] and other study of that biological system

Any of these ways can be criticized for...
*for seeking to make distinctions that aren't as universal as claimed ([[greedy reductionism]])
*for serious [[bias]] in point of view ([[subject-object problem]] or [[God's eye view]])
*for relying on theological or spiritual claims [[A priori and a posteriori (philosophy)|a priori]], for relying too much on surface conflict or current investigative priorities to point out differences
*for ignoring [[action (philosophy)|action]]
*for ignoring [[environmentalism (psychology)|the perceived]] or [[Gaia philosophy|biospheric]] context, or [[embodied philosophy|the cognitive mechanisms that perceive and invent categories]]
*or for relying on a complex empirical process of investigation that is poorly understood and only recently embarked upon.
In [[process philosophy]], this last is the only possibility, but historically philosophers have been loath to conclude that nothing exists but process.

===Intuition as evasion===
A seemingly simpler way to view categories is as arising only from intuition.  Philosophers argue this evades the issue.  What it means to take the category [[physical object]] seriously as a category of being is to assert that the concept of physical objecthood cannot be reduced to or explicated in any other terms - not, for example, in terms of [[bundle theory|bundles of properties]] but only in terms of other items in that category.

In this way, many ontological controversies can be understood as controversies about exactly which categories should be seen as fundamental, irreducible, or primitive.  To refer to intuition as the source of distinctions and thus categories doesn't resolve this.

====Ideology, dogma, theory====
Modern theories give weight to intuition, perceptually observed properties, comparisons of categories among persons, and the direction of investigation towards known specified ends, to determine what [[human]]ity in its present state of being needs to consider irreducible.  They seek to explain why certain beliefs about categories would appear in [[political science]] as [[ideology]], in [[religion]] as [[dogma]], or in [[science]] as [[theory]].

===as metaphors===
A set of ontological distinctions related by a single [[conceptual metaphor]] was called an [[ontological metaphor]] by [[George Lakoff]] and [[Mark Johnson (professor)|Mark Johnson]], who claimed that such metaphors arising from [[experience]] were more basic than any properties or symbol-based comparisons.  Their [[cognitive science of mathematics]] was a study of the embodiment of basic symbols and properties including those studied in the [[philosophy of mathematics]], via [[embodied philosophy]], using [[cognitive science]].  This theory comes after several thousand years of inquiry into patterns and [[cognitive bias]] of humanity.

==Categories of being==
Philosophers have many differing views on what the fundamental categories of being are. In no particular order, here are at least ''some'' items that have been regarded as categories of being by someone or other:

===Physical objects===
[[Physical object]]s are beings; certainly they are said to ''be'' in the simple sense that they ''exist'' all around us. So a house is a being, a person's body is a being, a tree is a being, a cloud is a being, and so on. They are beings because, and in the sense that, they are physical objects. One might also call them [[body|bodies]], or physical [[particular]]s, or [[concrete]] things, or [[matter]], or maybe [[Substance theory|substance]]s (but bear in mind the word 'substance' has some special philosophical meanings).

===Minds===
[[Mind]]s -- those &quot;parts&quot; of us that think and perceive—are considered beings by some philosophers. Each of us, according to [[common sense]] anyway, &quot;has&quot; a mind. Of course, philosophers rarely just assume that minds occupy a different category of beings from physical objects. Some, like [[René Descartes]], have thought that this is so (this view is known as [[dualism]], and [[Functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism]] also considers the mind as distinct from the body), while others have thought that concepts of the mental can be [[Reduction (philosophy)|reduced]] to physical concepts (this is the view of [[physicalism]] or [[materialism]]). Still others maintain though &quot;mind&quot; is a noun, it is not necessarily the &quot;name of a thing&quot; distinct within the whole person. In this view the relationship between mental properties and physical properties is one of [[supervenience]] &amp;ndash; similar to how &quot;banks&quot; supervene upon certain buildings. See [[Philosophy of mind]].

===Classes===
We can talk about all human beings, and the planets, and all engines as belonging to [[class (philosophy)|class]]es. Within the class of human beings are all of the human beings, or the [[extension (semantics)|extension]] of the term 'human being'. In the class of [[planet]]s would be Mercury, Venus, the Earth, and all the other planets that there might be in the universe. Classes, in addition to each of their members, are often taken to be beings. Surely we can say that in some sense, the class of planets ''is'', or has being. Classes are usually taken to be [[abstract objects]], like sets; 'class' is often regarded as equivalent, or nearly equivalent, in meaning to '[[Set (mathematics)|set]]'. Denying that classes and sets exist is the contemporary meaning of [[nominalism]].

===Properties===
The redness of a red apple, or more to the point, the redness all red things share, is a ''[[property (philosophy)|property]]''. One could also call it an ''attribute'' of the apple. Very roughly put, a property is just a quality that describes an object. This will not do as a definition of the word 'property' because, like 'attribute', 'quality' is a near-synonym of 'property'. But these synonyms can at least help us to get a fix on the concept we are talking about. Whenever one talks about the size, color, weight, composition, and so forth, of an object, one is talking about the properties of that object. Some—though this is a point of severe contention in the [[problem of universals]] -- believe that properties are beings; the redness of all apples is something that ''is.'' To deny that universals exist is the [[Scholastic philosophy|scholastic]] variant of [[nominalism]].

===Relations===
An apple sitting on a table is in a [[logic of relatives|relation]] to the table it sits on. So we can say that there is a relation between the apple and the table: namely, the relation of sitting-on. So, some say, we can say that that relation has being. For another example, the [[Washington Monument]] is taller than the [[White House]]. Being-taller-than is a relation between the two buildings. We can say that ''that'' relation has being as well. This, too, is a point of contention in the [[problem of universals]].

===Space and Time===
Space and time are what physical objects are extended into. There is debate as to whether time exists [[presentism (philosophy of time)|only in the present]] or whether far away times are [[eternalism (philosophy of time)|just as real as far away spaces]], and there is debate as to whether [[Curved space|space is curved]]. Many contemporary thinkers actually suggest that [[spacetime|time is the fourth dimension]], thus reducing space and time to one distinct ontological entity, the [[spacetime|space-time continuum]].

===Propositions===
[[Proposition (philosophy)|Proposition]]s are units of meaning. They should not be confused with [[declarative sentence]]s, which are just sets of words in languages that refer to propositions. Declarative sentences, ontologically speaking, are thus ideas, a property of substances (minds), rather than a distinct ontological category. For instance, the English declarative sentence &quot;snow is white&quot; refers to the same proposition as the equivalent French declarative sentence &quot;la neige est blanche&quot;; two sentences, one proposition. Similarly, one declarative sentence can refer to many propositions; for instance, &quot;I am hungry&quot; changes meaning (i.e. refers to different propositions) depending on the person uttering it.

===Events===
Events are that which can be said to occur. To illustrate, consider the claim &quot;John went to a ballgame&quot;; if true, then we must ontologically account for every entity in the sentence. &quot;John&quot; refers to a substance. But what does &quot;went to a ballgame&quot; refer to? It seems wrong to say that &quot;went to a ballgame&quot; is a property that instantiates John, because &quot;went to a ballgame&quot; does not seem to be the same ontological kind of thing as, for instance, redness. Thus, events arguably deserve their own ontological category.

Properties, relations, and classes are supposed to be ''[[Abstraction|abstract]],'' rather than ''[[Concrete (philosophy)|concrete]].'' Many philosophers say that properties and relations have an abstract existence, and that physical objects have a concrete existence. That, perhaps, is the [[paradigm case]] of a difference in ways in which items can be said to ''be,'' or to have being.

Many philosophers have attempted to reduce the number of distinct ontological categories. For instance,  [[David Hume]] famously regarded Space and Time as nothing more than psychological facts about human beings, which would effectively reduce Space and Time to ideas, which are properties of humans (substances). [[Nominalists]] and [[Philosophical realism|realists]] argue over the existence of properties and relations. Finally, events and propositions have been argued to be reducible to sets (classes) of substances and other such categories.

==History==
===Aristotle===
{{Main|Categories (Aristotle)}}

''Category'' came into use with [[Aristotle]]'s essay ''[[Categories (Aristotle)|Categories]]'', in which he discussed univocal and [[equivocal]] terms, predication, and ten categories:&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/2412/2412-h/2412-h.htm Categories]'', translated by [[Ella Mary Edghill|E. M. Edghill]]. For the Greek terms, see ''[http://meta.montclair.edu/ancient/greek/aristotle_greek/ The Complete Works of Aristotle in Greek]'' (requires DjVu), Book 1 (''Organon''), ''Categories'' Section 4 (DjVu file's page 6).&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Substance theory|Substance]]''', essence (''&lt;span lang=grc&gt;[[ousia]]&lt;/span&gt;'') — examples of primary substance: this man, this horse; secondary substance (species, genera): man, horse
*'''[[Quantity]]''' (''&lt;span lang=grc&gt;poson&lt;/span&gt;'', how much), discrete or continuous — examples: two cubits long, number, space, (length of) time.
*'''[[Quality (philosophy)|Quality]]''' (''&lt;span lang=grc&gt;poion&lt;/span&gt;'', of what kind or description) — examples: white, black, grammatical, hot, sweet, curved, straight.
*'''[[Finitary relation|Relation]]''' (''&lt;span lang=grc&gt;pros ti&lt;/span&gt;'', toward something) — examples: double, half, large, master, knowledge.
*'''[[Place (mathematics)|Place]]''' (''&lt;span lang=grc&gt;pou&lt;/span&gt;'', where) — examples: in a marketplace, in the Lyceum
*'''[[Time]]''' (''&lt;span lang=grc&gt;pote&lt;/span&gt;'', when) — examples: yesterday, last year
*'''[[Human position|Position]]''', posture, attitude (''&lt;span lang=grc&gt;keisthai&lt;/span&gt;'', to lie) — examples: sitting, lying, standing
*'''State''', condition (''&lt;span lang=grc&gt;echein&lt;/span&gt;'', to have or be) — examples: shod, armed
*'''[[Action (philosophy)|Action]]''' (''&lt;span lang=grc&gt;poiein&lt;/span&gt;'', to make or do) — examples: to lance, to heat, to cool (something)
*'''[[Affection (philosophy)|Affection]]''', passion (''&lt;span lang=grc&gt;paschein&lt;/span&gt;'', to suffer or undergo) — examples: to be lanced, to be heated, to be cooled

===Kant===
In his ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', [[Kant]] proposed the following system:
*[[Quantity]]
**Unity
**Plurality
**[[Totality]]
*[[Quality (philosophy)|Quality]]
**[[Reality]]
**[[Negation]]
**[[Limitation]]
*[[Relation of Ideas|Relation]]
**[[Inherence]] and [[Subsistence]] ([[Substance theory|substance]] and [[accident]])
**[[Causality]] and Dependence ([[cause]] and [[effect]])
**Community (reciprocity)
*[[Modality]]
**[[Possibility]]
**[[Existence]]
**[[Necessity]]

===Peirce &amp; Husserl===
[[Charles Sanders Peirce]], who had read Kant closely and who also had some knowledge of Aristotle, proposed a system of merely three phenomenological categories: ''Firstness'', ''Secondness'', and ''Thirdness'', which he repeatedly invoked in his subsequent writings.

[[Edmund Husserl]] (1962, 2000) wrote extensively about categorial systems as part of his [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]].

For [[Gilbert Ryle]] (1949), a category (in particular a &quot;[[category mistake]]&quot;) is an important semantic concept, but one having only loose affinities to an ontological category.

===Others===
Contemporary systems of categories have been proposed by [[Wilfrid Sellars]] (1974), Grossman (1983), Johansson (1989), Hoffman and Rosenkrantz (1994), [[Roderick Chisholm]] (1996), [[Barry Smith (ontologist)]] (2003), and [[Jonathan Lowe]] (2006).

'''Concrete''' is a [[composite material|composite]] construction material, composed of [[cement]] (commonly [[Portland cement]]) and other cementitious materials such as [[fly ash]] and [[slag cement]], [[construction aggregate|aggregate]] (generally a coarse aggregate made of gravel or crushed rocks such as [[limestone]], or [[granite]], plus a fine aggregate such as [[sand]]), [[water (properties)|water]], and [[Chemistry|chemical]] admixtures.

The word concrete comes from the Latin word &quot;concretus&quot; (meaning compact or condensed), the perfect passive participle of &quot;concrescere&quot;, from &quot;con-&quot; (together) and &quot;crescere&quot; (to grow).

Concrete solidifies and hardens after mixing with water and placement due to a [[Chemical reaction|chemical process]] known as [[mineral hydration|hydration]]. The water reacts with the cement, which bonds the other components together, eventually creating a robust stone-like material. Concrete is used to make [[Sidewalk|pavements]], pipe, [[architectural structure]]s, [[foundation (engineering)|foundations]], [[motorway]]s/[[road]]s, [[bridge]]s/[[overpass]]es, [[parking]] structures, [[brick]]/[[Concrete masonry unit|block]] walls and [[foundation (engineering)|footings]] for gates, [[fence]]s and [[Utility pole|poles]].

Concrete is used more than any other man-made material in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World|authorlink=Bjørn Lomborg|last=Lomborg|first=Bjørn|year=2001|isbn=978-0-521-80447-9|page=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2006, about 7.5 cubic kilometres of concrete are made each year—more than one cubic metre for every person on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Minerals commodity summary - cement - 2007 | publisher=US [[United States Geographic Service]]|date=2007-06-01|url=http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/cement/index.html|accessdate=2008-01-16}}&lt;!--Computed by taking 2007 figure for world concrete production, and the mix at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concrete#Regular_concrete and computing the volume--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Concrete powers a {{US$|35 billion}} industry, employing more than two million workers in the [[United States]] alone.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} More than {{convert|55000|mi|km}} of [[highway]]s in the United States are paved with this material. [[Reinforced concrete]], [[prestressed concrete]] and [[precast concrete]] are the most widely used types of concrete functional extensions in modern days.

==History==
Concrete has been used for construction in various ancient structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Ancient Concrete Structures|author=Stella L. Marusin|publisher=Concrete International|volume=18|issue=1|pages=56–58|date=January 1, 1996|postscript=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An analysis of ancient [[Egyptian pyramids]] has shown that concrete may have been employed in their construction, although its composition would have differed from modern concrete.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Ancient Egyptian Pyramids--Concrete or Rock|author=Donald H. Campbell and Robert L. Folk|journal=Concrete International|volume=13|issue=8|pages=28 &amp; 30–39|postscript=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Did the Great Pyramids' builders use concrete?|author= Colin Nickerson|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/23/world/africa/23iht-pyramid.1.12259608.html |newspaper= New York Times|date= 23 April 2008|accessdate=10 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Roman Empire]], [[Roman concrete]] (or ''[[opus caementicium]]'') was made from [[quicklime]], [[pozzolana]], and an aggregate of [[pumice]]. Its widespread use in many [[Architecture of ancient Rome|Roman structures]], a key event in the [[history of architecture]] termed the [[Roman Architectural Revolution]], freed [[Roman engineering|Roman construction]] from the restrictions of stone and brick material and allowed for revolutionary new designs in terms of both structural complexity and dimension.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Lancaster| first = Lynne| title = Concrete Vaulted Construction in Imperial Rome.

[[File:Pantheon rome 2005may.jpg|thumb|[[Hadrian]]'s [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] in Rome is an example of Roman concrete construction.]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;Concrete, as the Romans knew it, was a new and revolutionary material. Laid in the shape of [[arch]]es, [[Vault (architecture)|vaults]] and [[List of Roman domes|domes]], it quickly hardened into a rigid mass, free from many of the internal thrusts and strains that trouble the builders of similar structures in stone or brick.&lt;ref&gt;D.S. Robertson: ''Greek and Roman Architecture'', Cambridge, 1969, p. 233&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Modern tests show that ''opus caementicium'' had as much compressive strength as modern Portland-cement concrete (ca. 200&amp;nbsp;kg/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;Henry Cowan: The Masterbuilders, New York 1977, p. 56, ISBN 978-0-471-02740-9&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to the absence of [[Reinforced concrete|steel reinforcement]], its tensile strength was far lower and its mode of application was also different:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Modern structural concrete differs from Roman concrete in two important details. First, its mix consistency is fluid and homogeneous, allowing it to be poured into forms rather than requiring hand-layering together with the placement of aggregate, which, in Roman practice, often consisted of [[rubble]]. Second, integral reinforcing steel gives modern concrete assemblies great strength in tension, whereas Roman concrete could depend only upon the strength of the concrete bonding to resist tension.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Mark, Paul Hutchinson: &quot;On the Structure of the Roman Pantheon&quot;, ''Art Bulletin'', Vol. 68, No. 1 (1986), p. 26, fn. 5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The widespread use of concrete in many Roman structures has ensured that many survive to the present day. The [[Baths of Caracalla]] in [[Rome]] are just one example. Many [[Roman aqueduct]]s and [[bridge]]s have masonry cladding on a concrete core, as does the dome of the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]].

Some have stated that the secret of concrete was lost for 13 centuries until 1756, when the [[United Kingdom|British]] engineer [[John Smeaton]] pioneered the use of [[hydraulic lime]] in concrete, using pebbles and powdered brick as aggregate. However, the [[Canal du Midi]] was built using concrete in 1670.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/0/2/0/1/2/p20122_index.html The Politics of Rediscovery in the History of Science: Tacit Knowledge of Concrete before its Discovery]&lt;/ref&gt;  Likewise there are concrete structures in Finland that date back to the 16th century.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} [[Portland cement]] was first used in concrete in the early 1840s.

===Additives===
Concrete [[additive]]s have been used since Roman and Egyptian times, when it was discovered that adding volcanic ash to the mix allowed it to set under water. Similarly, the Romans knew that adding [[Horsehair|horse hair]] made concrete less liable to crack while it hardened, and adding blood made it more frost-resistant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.djc.com/special/concrete/10003364.htm Brief history of concrete]&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently the use of recycled materials as concrete ingredients has been gaining popularity because of increasingly stringent environmental legislation. The most conspicuous of these is [[fly ash]], a by-product of [[coal]]-fired power plants. This use reduces the amount of quarrying and landfill space required, and, as the ash acts as a cement replacement, reduces the amount of cement required.

In modern times, researchers have experimented with the addition of other materials to create concrete with improved properties, such as higher strength or electrical conductivity.  [[Marconite]] is one example.

==Composition==
There are many [[types of concrete]] available, created by varying the proportions of the main ingredients below. In this way or by substitution for the cemetitious and aggregate phases, the finished product can be tailored to its application with varying strength, density, or chemical and thermal resistance properties.

The ''[[types of concrete#Mix design|mix design]]'' depends on the type of structure being built, how the concrete will be mixed and delivered, and how it will be placed to form this structure.

===Cement===
Portland cement is the most common type of cement in general usage. It is a basic ingredient of concrete, [[mortar (masonry)|mortar]], and [[plaster]]. English masonry worker [[Joseph Aspdin]] patented Portland cement in 1824; it was named because of its similarity in colour to [[Portland stone|Portland limestone]], quarried from the English [[Isle of Portland]] and used extensively in [[London]] architecture. It consists of a mixture of oxides of [[calcium oxide|calcium]], [[silicon dioxide|silicon]] and [[aluminium oxide|aluminium]]. Portland cement and similar materials are made by heating [[limestone]] (a source of calcium) with clay, and grinding this product (called ''[[clinker (cement)|clinker]]'') with a source of [[sulfate]] (most commonly [[gypsum]]).

===Water===
Combining water with a cementitious material forms a cement paste by the process of hydration. The cement paste glues the aggregate together, fills voids within it, and allows it to flow more freely.

Less water in the cement paste will yield a stronger, more durable concrete; more water will give an freer-flowing concrete with a higher [[Concrete#Workability|slump]]. Impure water used to make concrete can cause problems when setting or in causing premature failure of the structure.

Hydration involves many different reactions, often occurring at the same time. As the reactions proceed, the products of the cement hydration process gradually bond together the individual sand and gravel particles, and other components of the concrete, to form a solid mass.

Reaction:
:[[Cement chemist notation]]: C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S + H → C-S-H + CH &lt;!-- Yes, this is correct --&gt;
:Standard notation: Ca&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → (CaO)·(SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)·(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)(gel) + Ca(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
:Balanced: 2Ca&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; + 7H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → 3(CaO)·2(SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)·4(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)(gel) + 3Ca(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

===Aggregates===
[[File:CementMixingWithSand.jpg|thumb|Cement and sand ready to be mixed.]]
Fine and coarse aggregates make up the bulk of a concrete mixture. [[Sand]], natural gravel and [[crushed stone]] are used mainly for this purpose. Recycled aggregates (from construction, demolition and excavation waste) are increasingly used as partial replacements of natural aggregates, while a number of manufactured aggregates, including air-cooled [[blast furnace]] slag and [[bottom ash]] are also permitted.

Decorative stones such as [[quartzite]], small river stones or crushed glass are sometimes added to the surface of concrete for a decorative &quot;exposed aggregate&quot; finish, popular among landscape designers.

The presence of aggregate greatly increases the robustness of concrete above that of cement, which otherwise is a brittle material, and thus concrete is a true composite material.

Redistribution of aggregates after compaction often creates inhomogeneity due to the influence of vibration. This can lead to strength gradients.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference

===Reinforcement===
[[File:Concrete rebar 0030.jpg|thumb|Installing [[rebar]] in a floor slab during a concrete pour.]]
Concrete is strong in [[compression (physical)|compression]], as the aggregate efficiently carries the compression load. However, it is weak in tension as the cement holding the aggregate in place can crack, allowing the structure to fail. [[Reinforced concrete]] solves these problems by adding either [[rebar|steel reinforcing bars]], steel fibres, glass fibre, or plastic fibre to carry [[tension (physics)|tensile loads]]. Thereafter the concrete is reinforced to withstand the tensile loads upon it.

===Chemical admixtures===
''[[Chemistry|Chemical]] admixtures'' are materials in the form of powder or fluids that are added to the concrete to give it certain characteristics not obtainable with plain concrete mixes. In normal use, admixture dosages are less than 5% by mass of cement, and are added to the concrete at the time of batching/mixing.&lt;ref name = &quot;FHWA Admixtures&quot;&gt;{{cite web | author = U.S. Federal Highway Administration | authorlink = Federal Highway Administration | title = Admixtures | url = http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/materialsgrp/admixture.html | accessdate = 2007-01-25 | date = 14 June 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; The common types of admixtures&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Cement Admixture Association | url = http://www.admixtures.org.uk/types.asp | title = Admixture Types | accessdate = 2010-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; are as follows.
* [[Accelerant|Accelerators]] speed up the hydration (hardening) of the concrete. Typical materials used are [[calcium chloride|{{chem|CaCl|2}}]], [[Calcium nitrate|Ca(NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[Sodium nitrate|NaNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]]. However, use of chlorides may cause corrosion in steel reinforcing and is prohibited in some countries, so that nitrates may be favoured.
* [[Retarder (chemistry)|Retarders]] slow the hydration of concrete, and are used in large or difficult pours where partial setting before the pour is complete is undesirable. Typical polyol retarders are sugar, sucrose, sodium gluconate, glucose, citric acid, and tartaric acid.
* [[Air entrainment]]s add and entrain tiny air bubbles in the concrete, which will reduce damage during [[Weathering|freeze-thaw]] cycles, thereby increasing the concrete's durability. However, entrained air entails a trade off with strength, as each 1% of air may result in 5% decrease in compressive strength.
* [[Plasticizer]]s increase the workability of plastic or &quot;fresh&quot; concrete, allowing it be placed more easily, with less consolidating effort. A typical plasticizer is lignosulfonate. Plasticizers can be used to reduce the water content of a concrete while maintaining workability, and are sometimes called ''water-reducers'' due to this use.  Such treatment improves its strength and durability characteristics. [[Superplasticizer]]s (also called ''high-range water-reducers'') are a class of plasticizers that have fewer deleterious effects, and can be used to increase workability more than is practical with traditional plasticizers. Compounds used as superplasticizers include sulfonated naphthalene formaldehyde condensate, sulfonated melamine formaldehyde condensate, acetone formaldehyde condensate, and polycarboxylate ethers.
* [[Pigment]]s can be used to change the colour of concrete, for aesthetics.
* [[Corrosion inhibitor]]s are used to minimize the corrosion of steel and steel bars in concrete.
* Bonding agents are used to create a bond between old and new concrete.
* Pumping aids improve pumpability, thicken the paste, and reduce separation and bleeding.

===Mineral admixtures and blended cements===
There are inorganic materials that also have [[pozzolan]]ic or latent hydraulic properties. These very [[Granularity|fine-grained]] materials are added to the concrete mix to improve the properties of concrete (mineral admixtures),&lt;ref name = &quot;FHWA Admixtures&quot;/&gt; or as a replacement for Portland cement (blended cements).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Kosmatka, S.H. | coauthors = Panarese, W.C. | title = Design and Control of Concrete Mixtures | publisher = Portland Cement Association | year = 1988 | location = Skokie, IL, USA | pages = 17, 42, 70, 184 | isbn = 978-0-89312-087-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Fly ash]]: A by-product of coal-fired [[power station|electric generating plants]], it is used to partially replace Portland cement (by up to 60% by mass). The properties of fly ash depend on the type of coal burnt. In general, siliceous fly ash is pozzolanic, while [[calcareous]] fly ash has latent hydraulic properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = U.S. Federal Highway Administration | authorlink = Federal Highway Administration | title = Fly Ash | url = http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/materialsgrp/flyash.htm | accessdate = 2007-01-24 | date = 14 June 1999 | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5QDfIot5I | archivedate = 2007-07-09| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Ground granulated blast furnace slag]] (GGBFS or GGBS): A by-product of [[steel]] production is used to partially replace Portland cement (by up to 80% by mass). It has latent hydraulic properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = U.S. Federal Highway Administration | authorlink = Federal Highway Administration | title = Ground Granulated Blast-Furnace Slag | url = http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/materialsgrp/ggbfs.htm | accessdate = 2007-01-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Silica fume]]: A by-product of the production of silicon and [[ferrosilicon]] alloys. Silica fume is similar to fly ash, but has a particle size 100 times smaller. This results in a higher surface to volume ratio and a much faster pozzolanic reaction. Silica fume is used to increase strength and durability of concrete, but generally requires the use of superplasticizers for workability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = U.S. Federal Highway Administration | authorlink = Federal Highway Administration | title = Silica Fume | url = http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/materialsgrp/silica.htm | accessdate = 2007-01-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* High reactivity [[Metakaolin]] (HRM): Metakaolin produces concrete with strength and durability similar to concrete made with silica fume. While silica fume is usually dark gray or black in colour, high-reactivity metakaolin is usually bright white in colour, making it the preferred choice for architectural concrete where appearance is important.

==Concrete production==
[[File:Osthafen-lieferbeton-ffm001.jpg|thumb|Concrete plant facility (background) with concrete delivery trucks.]]

The processes used vary dramatically, from hand tools to heavy industry, but result in the concrete being placed where it cures into a final form. Wide range of technological factors may occur during production of concrete elements and their influence to basic characteristics may vary&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.concreteresearch.org/PDFsandsoon/Bulavytskyi%20Ukraine.pdf article of Maksym Bulavytskyi (Ukraine)]&lt;/ref&gt;

When initially mixed together, Portland cement and water rapidly form a [[gel]], formed of tangled chains of interlocking crystals. These continue to react over time, with the initially fluid gel often aiding in placement by improving workability. As the concrete sets, the chains of crystals join and form a rigid structure, gluing the aggregate particles in place. During curing, more of the cement reacts with the residual water ([[hydration reaction|hydration]]).

This curing process develops physical and [[Chemical property|chemical properties]]. Among these qualities are [[Strength of materials|mechanical strength]], low moisture permeability, and chemical and volumetric stability.

[[File:Mixing concrete.jpg|thumb|Cement being mixed with sand and water to form concrete.]]

===Mixing concrete===
Thorough mixing is essential for the production of uniform, high quality concrete. For this reason equipment and methods should be capable of effectively mixing concrete materials containing the largest specified aggregate to produce ''uniform mixtures'' of the lowest slump practical for the work.

''Separate paste mixing'' has shown that the mixing of [[cement]] and water into a paste before combining these materials with [[Construction aggregate|aggregates]] can increase the [[compressive strength]] of the resulting concrete.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.concreteinternational.com/pages/featured_article.asp?ID=3491 Premixed Cement Paste]&lt;/ref&gt; The paste is generally mixed in a ''high-speed'', shear-type mixer at a [[Water-cement ratio|w/cm]] (water to cement ratio) of 0.30 to 0.45 by mass. The cement paste premix may include admixtures such as accelerators or retarders, plasticizers, [[pigment]]s, or [[silica fume]].  The premixed paste is then blended with aggregates and any remaining batch water, and final mixing is completed in conventional concrete mixing equipment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.concrete.org/COMMITTEES/committeehome.asp?committee_code=0000304-00 Measuring, Mixing, Transporting, and Placing Concrete]&lt;/ref&gt;

High-energy mixed (HEM) concrete is produced by means of high-speed mixing of cement, water, and sand with net [[Energy density|specific energy]] consumption of at least 5 kilojoules per kilogram of the mix. A [[plasticizer]] or a [[superplasticizer]] is then added to the activated mixture, which can later be mixed with aggregates in a conventional [[concrete mixer]]. In this process, sand provides dissipation of energy and creates high shear conditions on the surface of cement particles. This results in the full volume of water interacting with cement. The liquid activated mixture can be used by itself or foamed (expanded) for lightweight concrete.&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent|5443313}} - Method for producing construction mixture for concrete&lt;/ref&gt; HEM concrete hardens in low and subzero temperature conditions and possesses an increased volume of gel, which drastically reduces [[capillarity]] in solid and porous materials.

[[File:Curing-concrete.jpg|thumb|A concrete slab ponded while curing.]]

===Workability===
{{Main|Concrete slump test}}
''Workability'' is the ability of a fresh (plastic) concrete mix to fill the form/molud properly with the desired work (vibration) and without reducing the concrete's quality. Workability depends on water content, aggregate (shape and size distribution), cementitious content and age (level of [[hydration reaction|hydration]]), and can be modified by adding chemical admixtures, like superplasticizer. Raising the water content or adding chemical admixtures will increase concrete workability. Excessive water will lead to increased bleeding ([[surface water]]) and/or segregation of aggregates (when the cement and aggregates start to separate), with the resulting concrete having reduced quality. The use of an aggregate with an undesirable gradation can result in a very harsh mix design with a very low slump, which cannot be readily made more workable by addition of reasonable amounts of water.

Workability can be measured by the [[concrete slump test]], a simplistic measure of the plasticity of a fresh batch of concrete following the [[ASTM]] C 143 or EN 12350-2 test standards. Slump is normally measured by filling an &quot;[[Duff Abrams|Abrams cone]]&quot; with a sample from a fresh batch of concrete. The cone is placed with the wide end down onto a level, non-absorptive surface. It is then filled in three layers of equal volume, with each layer being tamped with a steel rod in order to consolidate the layer. When the cone is carefully lifted off, the enclosed material will slump a certain amount due to gravity. A relatively dry sample will slump very little, having a slump value of one or two inches (25 or 50&amp;nbsp;mm). A relatively wet concrete sample may slump as much as eight inches. Workability can also be measured by using the [[flow table test]].

Slump can be increased by addition of chemical admixtures such as plasticizer or superplasticizer without changing the [[water-cement ratio]]. Some other admixtures, especially air-entraining admixture, can increase the slump of a mix.

High-flow concrete, like [[Concrete#Self-consolidating concretes|self-consolidating concrete]], is tested by other flow-measuring methods. One of these methods includes placing the cone on the narrow end and observing how the mix flows through the cone while it is gradually lifted.

After mixing, concrete is a fluid and can be pumped to the location where needed.

===Curing===

In all but the least critical applications, care needs to be taken to properly ''cure'' concrete, to achieve best strength and hardness. This happens after the concrete has been placed. Cement requires a moist, controlled environment to gain strength and harden fully. The cement paste hardens over time, initially setting and becoming rigid though very weak, and gaining in strength in the weeks following. In around 3 weeks, typically over 90% of the final strength is reached, though strengthening may continue for decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Concrete Testing | url=http://technology.calumet.purdue.edu/cnt/rbennet/concrete%20lab.htm | accessdate=2008-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conversion of [[calcium hydroxide]] in the concrete into [[calcium carbonate]] from absorption of [[carbon dioxide|CO2]] over several decades further strengthen the concrete and making it more resilient to damage. However, this reaction, called [[carbonation]], lowers the pH of the cement pore solution and can cause the reinforcement bars to corrode.

Hydration and hardening of concrete during the first three days is critical. Abnormally fast drying and shrinkage due to factors such as evaporation from wind during placement may lead to increased tensile stresses at a time when it has not yet gained sufficient strength, resulting in greater shrinkage cracking. The early strength of the concrete can be increased if it is kept damp during the curing process. Minimizing stress prior to curing minimizes cracking. High-early-strength concrete is designed to hydrate faster, often by increased use of cement that increases shrinkage and cracking. Strength of concrete changes (increases) up to three years. It depends on cross-section dimension of elements and conditions of structure exploitation.&lt;ref&gt;Resulting strength distribution in vertical elements researched and presented at the article [http://www.concreteresearch.org/PDFsandsoon/Inhomog%20Denver.pdf &quot;Concrete Inhomogeneity of Vertical Cast-In-Place Elements In Skeleton-Type Buildings&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

During this period concrete needs to be kept under controlled temperature and humid atmosphere. In practice, this is achieved by spraying or ponding the concrete surface with water, thereby protecting the concrete mass from ill effects of ambient conditions. The pictures to the right show two of many ways to achieve this, ponding&amp;nbsp;– submerging setting concrete in water, and wrapping in plastic to contain the water in the mix.

Properly curing concrete leads to increased strength and lower permeability, and avoids cracking where the surface dries out prematurely. Care must also be taken to avoid freezing, or overheating due to the [[exothermic]] setting of cement (the [[Hoover Dam]] used pipes carrying coolant during setting to avoid damaging overheating). Improper curing can cause scaling, reduced strength, poor abrasion resistance, and cracking.

==Properties==
{{Main|Properties of concrete}}
Concrete has relatively high [[compressive strength]], but much lower [[tensile strength]], and for this reason is usually reinforced with materials that are strong in tension (often steel). The elasticity of concrete is relatively constant at low stress levels but starts decreasing at higher stress levels as matrix cracking develops. Concrete has a very low [[coefficient of thermal expansion]], and shrinks as it matures. All concrete structures will crack to some extent, due to shrinkage and tension. Concrete that is subjected to long-duration forces is prone to [[Creep (deformation)|creep]].

Tests can be made to ensure the properties of concrete correspond to specifications for the application.

==Environmental concerns==
:''For the environmental impact of cement production see [[Cement#Environmental and social impacts|Cement]]''

===Carbon dioxide emissions and climate change===
The [[cement]] industry is one of two primary producers of carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), creating up to 5% of worldwide man-made emissions of this gas, of which 50% is from the chemical process, and 40% from burning fuel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wbcsd.org/includes/getTarget.asp?type=d&amp;id=ODY3MA The Cement Sustainability Initiative: Progress report], ''[[World Business Council for Sustainable Development]]'', published 2002-06-01&lt;/ref&gt; The embodied carbon dioxide (ECO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) of one tonne of concrete is around 100&amp;nbsp;kg/tonne.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Cement manufacture contributes greenhouse gases both directly through the production of carbon dioxide when [[calcium carbonate]] is thermally decomposed, producing [[lime (material)|lime]] and [[carbon dioxide]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/1605/ggrpt/carbon.html EIA - Emissions of Greenhouse Gases in the U.S. 2006-Carbon Dioxide Emissions]&lt;/ref&gt; and also through the use of energy, particularly from the combustion of [[fossil fuel]]s. However, some companies have recognized the problem and are envisaging solutions to counter their CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions. The principle of [[carbon capture and storage]] consists of directly capturing the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at the outlet of the cement kiln in order to transport it and to store the captured CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in an adequate and deep geological formation.

===Surface runoff===
[[Surface runoff]], when water runs off [[impervious surface]]s, such as non-porous concrete, can cause heavy soil erosion.

===Urban heat===
Both concrete and [[asphalt]] are the primary contributors to what is known as the [[urban heat island]] effect.

Using light-coloured concrete has proven effective in reflecting up to 50% more light than asphalt and reducing ambient temperature.&lt;ref name=&quot;coolpave&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Cool Pavement Report | url=http://www.epa.gov/heatisland/resources/pdf/CoolPavementReport_Former%20Guide_complete.pdf | format=PDF |date = June 2005| publisher=[[Environmental Protection Agency]] | accessdate=2009-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; A low [[albedo]] value, characteristic of black asphalt, absorbs a large percentage of solar heat and contributes to the warming of cities. By paving with light coloured concrete, in addition to replacing asphalt with light-coloured concrete, communities can lower their average temperature.&lt;ref name=&quot;worldchange&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author=Gore, A | coauthors=Steffen, A | title=World Changing: A User's Giode for the 21st Century | publisher=Abrams | location=New York | year=2008 | page= 258}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many U.S. cities, pavement covers about 30-40% of the surface area.&lt;ref name=&quot;coolpave&quot;/&gt; This directly affects the temperature of the city, and contributes to the [[urban heat island]] effect. Paving with light-coloured concrete would lower temperatures of paved areas and improve night-time visibility.&lt;ref name=&quot;coolpave&quot;/&gt; The potential of energy saving within an area is also high. With lower temperatures, the demand for air conditioning decreases, saving energy.

Atlanta has tried to mitigate the heat-island effect. City officials noted that when using heat-reflecting concrete, their average city temperature decreased by 6&amp;nbsp;°F.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.concreteresources.net/categories/4F26A962-D021-233F-FCC5EF707CBD860A/fun_facts.html | title=Concrete facts | publisher=Pacific Southwest Concrete Alliance | accessdate=2009-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Design Trust for Public Space found that by slightly raising the albedo value in New York City, beneficial effects such as energy savings could be achieved.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} It was concluded that this could be accomplished by the replacement of black asphalt with light-coloured concrete.

However, in winter this may be a disadvantage as ice will form more easily and remain longer on the light coloured surfaces as they will be colder due to less energy absorbed from the reduced amount of sunlight in winter.&lt;ref name=&quot;worldchange&quot;/&gt;

===Concrete dust===
Building demolition and natural disasters such as earthquakes often release a large amount of concrete dust into the local atmosphere. Concrete dust was concluded to be the major source of dangerous air pollution following the [[Great Hanshin earthquake]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

==Health concerns==
The presence of some substances in concrete, including useful and unwanted additives, can cause health concerns. Natural [[radioactive]] elements (K, U and Th) can be present in various concentration in concrete dwellings, depending on the source of the raw materials used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6VB2-4FJTP9H-1&amp;_user=10&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=3c616658c5ed5a169e1fb4f3d1b997a3 Radionuclide content of concrete building blocks and radiation dose rates in some dwellings in Ibadan, Nigeria] {{dead link|date=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Toxic substances may also be added to the mixture for making concrete by unscrupulous makers. Dust from rubble or broken concrete upon demolition or crumbling may cause serious health concerns depending also on what had been incorporated in the concrete.

===Concrete handling/safety precautions===
Handling of wet concrete must always be done with proper protective equipment. Contact with wet concrete can cause skin [[chemical burn]]s due to the [[Corrosive substance|caustic]] nature of the mixture of cement and water. Indeed, the pH of fresh cement water is highly [[alkaline]] due to the presence of free [[potassium hydroxide|potassium]] and [[sodium hydroxide]]s in solution (pH ~&amp;nbsp;13.5). Eyes, hands and feet must be correctly protected to avoid any direct contact with wet concrete and washed without delay if necessary.

Concrete can be damaged by many processes, such as the expansion of [[corrosion]] products of the steel [[rebar|reinforcement bars]], freezing of trapped water, fire or radiant heat, aggregate expansion, sea water effects, bacterial corrosion, leaching, erosion by fast-flowing water, physical damage and chemical damage (from carbonation, chlorides, sulphates and distillate water).{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

==Concrete repair==

Concrete pavement preservation (CPP) and concrete pavement restoration (CPR) are techniques used to manage the rate of pavement deterioration on concrete streets, highways and airports. Without changing concrete grade, this non-overlay method is used to repair isolated areas of distress.  [[International Grooving &amp; Grinding Association|CPP and CPR]] techniques include slab stabilization, full- and partial-depth repair, dowel bar retrofit, cross stitching longitudinal cracks or joints, diamond grinding and joint and crack resealing. CPR methods, developed over the last 40 years, are utilized in lieu of short-lived asphalt overlays and bituminous patches to repair roads. These methods are often less expensive {{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}than an asphalt overlay but last three times longer and provide a greener solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CPR techniques can be used to address specific problems or bring a pavement back to its original quality. When repairing a road, design data, construction data, traffic data, environmental data, previous CPR activities and pavement condition, must all be taken into account. Pavements repaired using CPR methods usually last 15 years. The methods are described below.
* [[Road#Repair Techniques|Slab stabilization]] restores support to concrete slabs by filling small voids that develop underneath the concrete slab at joints, cracks or the pavement edge.
* Full-depth repairs fixes cracked slabs and joint deterioration by removing at least a portion of the existing slab and replacing it with new concrete.
* Partial-depth repairs corrects surface distress and joint-crack deterioration in the upper third of the concrete slab. Placing a partial-depth repair involves removing the deteriorated concrete, cleaning the patch area and placing new concrete.
* [[Dowel bar retrofit]] consists of cutting slots in the pavement across the joint or crack, cleaning the slots, placing the dowel bars and backfilling the slots with new concrete. Dowel bar retrofits link slabs together at transverse cracks and joints so that the load is evenly distributed across the crack or joint.
* Cross-stitching longitudinal cracks or joints repairs low-severity longitudinal cracks. This method adds reinforcing steel to hold the crack together tightly.
* [[Diamond blade#Diamond grinding of pavement|Diamond grinding]], by removing faulting, slab warping, studded tire wear and unevenness resulting from patches, diamond grinding creates a smooth, uniform pavement profile. Diamond grinding reduces road noise by providing a longitudinal texture, which is quieter than transverse textures. The longitudinal texture also enhances surface texture and skid resistance in polished pavements.
* [[Road#Repair Techniques|Joint and crack sealing]] minimizes the infiltration of surface water and incompressible material into the joint system. Minimizing water entering the joint reduces sub-grade softening, slows pumping and erosion of the sub-base fines, and may limit dowel-bar corrosion caused by de-icing chemicals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.airportbiz.com/online/article.jsp?id=845&amp;siteSection=1 AirportBusiness.com » Article » Grooving &amp; Grinding] Airport Business&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concrete recycling==
{{Main|Concrete recycling}}
Concrete recycling is an increasingly common method of disposing of concrete structures. Concrete debris was once routinely shipped to [[landfill]]s for disposal, but recycling is increasing due to improved environmental awareness, governmental laws, and economic benefits.

Concrete, which must be free of trash, wood, paper and other such materials, is collected from demolition sites and put through a [[crusher|crushing machine]], often along with asphalt, bricks, and rocks.

Reinforced concrete contains [[rebar]] and other metallic reinforcements, which are removed with [[magnet]]s and recycled elsewhere. The remaining aggregate chunks are sorted by size. Larger chunks may go through the crusher again. Smaller pieces of concrete are used as gravel for new construction projects. [[Aggregate base]] gravel is laid down as the lowest layer in a road, with fresh concrete or asphalt placed over it. Crushed recycled concrete can sometimes be used as the dry aggregate for brand new concrete if it is free of contaminants, though the use of recycled concrete limits strength and is not allowed in many jurisdictions. On March 3, 1983, a government funded research team (the VIRL research.codep) approximated that almost 17% of worldwide landfill was by-products of concrete based waste.

Recycling concrete provides environmental benefits, conserving landfill space and use as [[Construction aggregate|aggregate]] reduces the need for [[open-pit mining|gravel mining]].

==World records==
The world record for the largest concrete pour in a single project is the [[Three Gorges Dam]] in [[Hubei]] Province, China by the Three Gorges Corporation. The amount of concrete used in the construction of the dam is estimated at 16 million cubic meters over 17 years. The previous record was 3.2 million cubic meters held by [[Itaipu Dam|Itaipu hydropower station]] in Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Concrete pumping===
The world record was set at on 7 August 2009 during the construction of the [[Parbati River (Himachal Pradesh)|Parbati]] Hydroelectric Project, near the village of Suind, [[Himachal Pradesh]], India, when the concrete mix was pumped through a vertical height of {{convert|715|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.masterbuilder.co.in/ci/293/Concrete-Pumping/ |title=Concrete Pumping to 715&amp;nbsp;m Vertical - A New World Record Parbati Hydroelectric Project Inclined Pressure Shaft Himachal Pradesh - A case Study |publisher=The Masterbuilder |accessdate=21 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbmcw.com/articles/equipment-a-machinery/5470-schwing-stetter-launches-new-truck-mounted-concrete-pump-s-36.html |title=SCHWING Stetter Launches New Truck mounted Concrete Pump S-36 |date = October 2009|publisher=NBM&amp;CW (New Building Materials and Construction World)|accessdate=21 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Continuous pours===
The world record for largest continuously poured concrete raft was achieved in August 2007 in Abu Dhabi by contracting firm Al Habtoor-CCC Joint Venture.
The pour (a part of the foundation for the Abu Dhabi's [[The Landmark (Abu Dhabi)|Landmark Tower]]) was 16,000 cubic meters of concrete poured within a two day period.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leighton.com.au/verve/_resources/AlHabtoorIssue24.pdf Al Habtoor Engineering] - ''Abu Dhabi - Landmark Tower has a record-breaking pour'' - September/October 2007, Page 7.&lt;/ref&gt; The previous record (close to 10,500 cubic meters) was held by Dubai Contracting Company and achieved March 23, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arabianbusiness.com/10764-record-concrete-pour-takes-place-on-al-durrah Record concrete pour takes place on Al Durrah]&lt;/ref&gt;

The world record for largest continuously poured concrete floor was completed November 8, 1997, in [[Louisville, Kentucky]] by design-build firm EXXCEL Project Management.  The monolithic placement consisted of {{convert|225000|sqft|m2}} of concrete placed within a 30 hour period, finished to a flatness tolerance of F&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; 54.60 and a levelness tolerance of F&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; 43.83.

==Use of concrete in infrastructure==
===Mass concrete structures===
These include [[gravity dam]]s such as the [[Hoover Dam]], the [[Itaipu Dam]], and the [[Three Gorges Dam]] and large [[breakwater (structure)|breakwaters]]. Concrete that is poured all at once in one block (so that there are no weak points where the concrete is &quot;welded&quot; together) is used for [[tornado shelter]]s.

===Reinforced concrete structures===
{{Main|Reinforced concrete}}

Reinforced concrete contains steel reinforcing that is designed and placed in the structure at specific positions to cater for all the stress conditions that the structure is required to accommodate.

===Pre-stressed concrete structures===
{{Main|Pre-stressed concrete}}
'''Pre-stressed concrete''' is a form of reinforced concrete that builds in [[compressive stress]]es during construction to oppose those found when in use. This can greatly reduce the weight of beams or slabs, by better distributing the stresses in the structure to make optimal use of the reinforcement. For example a horizontal beam will tend to sag down. If the reinforcement along the bottom of the beam is pre-stressed, it can counteract this.

In pre-tensioned concrete, the pre-stressing is achieved by using steel or polymer tendons or bars that are subjected to a tensile force prior to casting, or for post-tensioned concrete, after casting.

===Concrete textures===
When one thinks of concrete, the image of a dull, gray concrete wall often comes to mind. With the use of [[form liner]], concrete can be cast and moulded into different textures and used for [[decorative concrete]] applications. Sound/retaining walls, bridges, office buildings and more serve as the optimal canvases for concrete art. For example, the Pima Freeway/Loop 101 retaining and sound walls in Scottsdale, Arizona, feature desert flora and fauna, a {{convert|67|ft|m|adj=on}} lizard and {{convert|40|ft|m|adj=on}} cacti along the {{convert|8|mi|km|adj=on}} stretch. The project, titled &quot;The Path Most Travelled,&quot; is one example of how concrete can be shaped using elastomeric form liner.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

==Building with concrete==

Concrete is one of the most durable building materials. It provides superior fire resistance compared with wooden construction, can gain strength over time. Structures made of concrete can have a long service life.  Concrete is the most widely used construction material in the world with annual consumption estimated at between 21 and 31 billion tonnes.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

===Environmentally sustainable===
With its 100-year service life, concrete conserves resources by reducing the need for reconstruction. Its ingredients are cement and readily available natural materials: water, aggregate (sand and gravel or crushed stone).  Concrete does not require any CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; absorbing trees to be cut down. The land required to extract the materials needed to make concrete is only a fraction of that used to harvest forests for [[lumber]].

[[File:BathsOfCaracalla.jpg|thumb|The [[Baths of Caracalla]], [[Rome]], [[Italy]], in 2003.]]

Concrete absorbs CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; throughout its lifetime through carbonation, helping reduce its carbon footprint. A recent study &lt;ref&gt;Nordic Innovation Centre Project 03018 http://www.nordicinnovation.net/img/03018_carbon_dioxide_uptake_in_demolished_and_crushed_concrete.pdf {{dead link|date=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; indicates that in countries with the most favourable recycling practices, it is realistic to assume that approximately 86% of the concrete is carbonated after 100 years. During this time, the concrete will absorb approximately 57% of the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emitted during the original calcination.  About 50% of the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is absorbed within a short time after concrete is crushed during recycling operations.

Concrete consists of between 7% and 15% cement, its only energy-intensive ingredient.  A study &lt;ref&gt;Pentalla, Vesa, Concrete and Sustainable Development, ACI Materials Journal, September- October 1997, American Concrete Institute, Farmington Hills, MI, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;  comparing the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions of several different building materials for construction of residential and commercial buildings found that concrete accounted for 147&amp;nbsp;kg of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; per 1000&amp;nbsp;kg used, metals accounted for 3000&amp;nbsp;kg of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and wood accounted for 127&amp;nbsp;kg of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The quantity of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; generated during the cement manufacturing process can be reduced by changing the raw materials used in its manufacture.

A new environmentally friendly blend of cement known as Portland-limestone cement (PLC) is gaining ground all over the world. It contains up to 15% limestone, rather than the 5% in regular Portland cement and results in 10% less CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions from production with no impact on product performance. Concrete made with PLC performs similarly to concrete made with regular cement and thus PLC-based concrete can be widely used as a replacement. In Europe, PLC-based concrete has replaced about 40% of general use concrete. In Canada, PLC will be included in the National Building Code in 2010. The approval of PLC is still under consideration in the United States.

===Energy efficiency===
Energy requirements for transportation of concrete are low because it is produced locally from local resources, typically manufactured within 100 kilometres of the job site. Once in place, concrete offers significant energy efficiency over the lifetime of a building.&lt;ref&gt;Gajda, John, Energy Use of Single Family Houses with Various Exterior Walls, Construction Technology Laboratories Inc, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Concrete walls leak air far less than those made of wood-frames. Air leakage accounts for a large percentage of energy loss from a home. The thermal mass properties of concrete increase the efficiency of both residential and commercial buildings. By storing and releasing the energy needed for heating or cooling, concrete's thermal mass delivers year-round benefits by reducing temperature swings inside and minimizing heating and cooling costs. While insulation reduces energy loss through the building envelope, thermal mass uses walls to store and release energy. Modern concrete wall systems use both insulation and thermal mass to create an energy-efficient building. Insulating Concrete Forms (ICFs) are hollow blocks or panels made of either insulating foam or [[rastra]] that are stacked to form the shape of the walls of a building and then filled with reinforced concrete to create the structure.

[[File:Lentos-Betonporsche Linz 09 crop.jpg|thumb|Models of [[Porsche]] automobiles, made out of concrete, part of an exhibition, &quot;Best of Austria,&quot; in the Lentos Museum in [[Linz, Austria]] in 2009.]]

===Fire safety and quality of life===
Concrete buildings are more resistant to fire than those constructed using wood or steel frames. Since concrete does not burn and stops fire from spreading, it offers total fire protection for occupants and their property. Concrete reduces the risk of structural collapse and is an effective fire shield, providing safe means of escape for occupants and protection for fire fighters. Furthermore, it does not produce any smoke or toxic gases and does not drip molten particles, which can spread fire. Neither heat, flames nor the water used to extinguish a fire seriously affect the structure of concrete walls and floors making repairs after a fire a relatively simple task.

A study{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} was conducted in Sweden by Olle Lundberg on the cost of fire damage associated with larger fires in multi-unit buildings, based on statistics from the insurance association in Sweden (Försäkringsförbundet). The study was limited to buildings with an insured value greater than €150,000. It covered 125 fires that occurred between 1995 and 2004, about 10% of the fires in multi-family homes, but 56% of the major fires. The results showed that:

* the average insurance payout per fire, per unit in wood frame buildings was around five times that of fires in concrete buildings (approximately €50,000 compared with €10,000)
* a major fire is more than 11 times more likely to develop in a wood-frame house than in one built using concrete
* among the burned houses, 50% of those made with wood had to be demolished, whereas only 9% of the concrete ones were beyond repair
* the fire spread to neighbouring apartments in only three of the 55 fires in concrete houses
* of those 55 fires, 45 were in attics and roofing

Options for non-combustible construction include floors, ceilings and roofs made of cast-in-place and hollow-core precast concrete. For walls, concrete masonry technology and Insulating Concrete Forms (ICFs) are additional options. ICFs are hollow blocks or panels made of fire-proof insulating foam that are stacked to form the shape of the walls of a building and then filled with reinforced concrete to create the structure.

“Fire-wall” tests, in which ICF walls were subjected to a continuous gas flame with a temperature of more than 1000&amp;nbsp;°C for as long as 4 hours showed no significant breaks in the concrete layer or dangerous transmission of heat. In comparison, wood frame walls normally collapse in an hour or less under these conditions. Concrete provides stable compartmentation in large industrial and multi-storey buildings so a fire starting in one section does not spread to others.

Using concrete to construct buildings offers the best possible protection and safety in fires:
[[File:Concrete_construction.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Multi-story residential buildings constructed using concrete in Chile.]]
* it does not burn or add to fire load
* it has high resistance to fire, preventing it from spreading thus reduces resulting environmental pollution
* it does not produce any smoke, toxic gases or drip molten particles
* it reduces the risk of structural collapse
* it provides safe means of escape for occupants and access for fire fighters as it is an effective fire shield
* it is not affected by the water used to put out a fire
* it is easy to repair after a fire and thus helps residents and businesses recover sooner
* it resists extreme fire conditions, making it ideal for storage facilities with a high fire load
* it provides complete fire protection so there is normally no need for additional measures
[[File:Crushed Concrete Granular Fill.jpg|thumb|Recycled crushed concrete being loaded into a semi-dump truck to be used as granular fill.]]
Concrete also provides the best resistance of any building material to high winds, hurricanes, tornadoes due to its lateral stiffness that  results in minimal horizontal movement.  When properly designed for ductility, it also provides superior resistance to seismic events.  It does not rust, rot or sustain growth of mould and stands up well to the freeze – thaw cycle. As a result of all these benefits, insurance for concrete homes is often 15 to 25 percent lower than for comparable wood frame homes.

Concrete buildings also have excellent indoor air quality with no off-gassing, toxicity and release of volatile organic compounds so they are generally healthier to live in than those made of wood or steel. As it is practically inert and waterproof, concrete does not need volatile organic-based preservatives, special coatings or sealers. Concrete can be easily cleaned with organic, non-toxic substances. Its sound insulating properties make buildings and homes a quiet and comfortable living environment. After accounting for sound passing through windows, a concrete home is about two-thirds quieter than a comparable wood-frame home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Noise Control in Buildings: A Guide for Architects and Engineers|author=Cyril M. Harris|publisher=Mcgraw-Hill|year=1993|isbn=978-0-07-026887-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the long life of concrete structures, their impacts on the environment are negligible. Once built, they have minimal maintenance requirements and as a result minimal social disruption. Using concrete reduces construction waste as it is used on an as-required basis, thereby minimizing the waste put into landfills.

===Recycling and recyclable===

A nearly inert material, concrete is suitable as a medium for recycling waste and industrial by-products. Fly ash, slag and silica fume are used in making concrete, which helps reduce embodied energy, carbon footprint and quantity of landfill materials.
The process of making cement also uses waste materials. Tires have high energy content and can supplement coal as fuel in the kiln. Industrial by-products such as ash from coal combustion, fly ash from power stations as well as mill scale and foundry sand from steel casting provide the silica, calcium, alumina and iron needed for making cement. Even kiln dust, a solid waste generated by cement manufacturing, is often recycled back into the kiln as a raw material.
Old concrete that has reached the end of its service life can be recycled and reused as granular fill for road beds.

'''Coitus interruptus''', also known as the '''withdrawal''' or '''pull-out method''', is a method of birth-control in which a man, during intercourse withdraws his penis from a woman's vagina prior to [[ejaculation]].  The man then directs his ejaculate ([[semen]]) away from his partner's [[vagina]] in an effort to avoid [[insemination]]. 

This method of [[contraception]], widely used for at least two millennia, is still in use today. This method was used by an estimated thirty-eight million couples worldwide in 1991.&lt;!--

==History==
Perhaps the oldest documentation of the use of the withdrawal method to avoid pregnancy is the story of [[Onan]] in the [[Torah]].  This text is believed to have been written down over 2,500 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Adams |first=Cecil |authorlink=Cecil Adams |title=Who wrote the Bible? (Part 1) |work=The Straight Dope |publisher=Creative Loafing Media, Inc. |date=2002-01-07 |url=http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/1985/who-wrote-the-bible-part-1 |accessdate=2009-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Societies in the ancient civilizations of [[Ancient Greece|Greece]] and [[Roman Empire|Rome]] preferred small families and are known to have practiced a variety of birth control methods.&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot;/&gt;{{rp|12,16-17}}  There are references that have led historians to believe withdrawal was sometimes used as birth control.&lt;ref name=&quot;eobc&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Bullough, Vern L. |title=Encyclopedia of birth control |publisher=ABC-CLIO |location=Santa Barbara, Calif |year=2001 |pages=74&amp;ndash;75 |isbn=1-57607-181-2 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=XuX-MGTZnJoC&amp;pg=PA74&amp;lpg=PA74 |accessdate=2009-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, these societies viewed birth control as a woman's responsibility, and the only well-documented contraception methods were female-controlled devices (both possibly effective, such as [[pessary|pessaries]], and ineffective, such as [[amulet]]s).&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot;&gt;{{cite book | first=Aine | last=Collier | year=2007 | title=The Humble Little Condom: A History | publisher=Prometheus Books | location=Amherst, NY | isbn=978-1-59102-556-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|17,23}}

After the [[decline of the Roman Empire]] in the 5th century, contraceptive practices fell out of use in Europe; the use of contraceptive pessaries, for example, is not documented again until the 15th century. If withdrawal were used during the Roman Empire, knowledge of the practice may have been lost during its decline.&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot;/&gt;{{rp|33,42}} 

From the 18th century until the development of modern methods, withdrawal was one of the most popular methods of birth-control in Europe, North America, and elsewhere.&lt;ref name=&quot;eobc&quot;/&gt;

Most Muslim scholars say withdrawal (عزل or 'Azl) must be done with the consent of the wife, stating that the wife has the right to conceive.{{citation needed|date=October 2010}}

== Effect ==
Like many methods of birth control, reliable effect is achieved only by correct and consistent use. Observed failure rates of withdrawal vary depending on the population being studied: studies have found actual failure rates of 15-28% per year.&lt;!--

For couples that use coitus interruptus correctly at every act of intercourse, the failure rate is 4% per year. In comparison the pill has a perfect-use failure rate of 0.3%, and the I.U.D. has a perfect-use failure rate of 0.6%.  The condom has a perfect-use failure rate of 2%.&lt;!--

It has been suggested that the [[pre-ejaculate]] (&quot;[[Cowper's fluid]]&quot;) emitted by the penis prior to ejaculation normally contains [[Spermatozoon|spermatozoa]] (sperm cells), which would compromise the effectiveness of the method.&lt;!--

== Advantages ==
The advantage of coitus interruptus is that it can be used by people who have objections to or do not have access to other forms of contraception. Some men prefer it so they can avoid possible adverse effects of hormonal contraceptives on their partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ortayli, N|title=Why Withdrawal? Why not withdrawal? Men's perspectives|journal=Reproductive Health Matters|year=2005|issue=13|volume=25|pages=164–73|pmid=16035610|doi=10.1016/S0968-8080(05)25175-3|last2=Bulut|first2=A|last3=Ozugurlu|first3=M|last4=Cokar|first4=M}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some women also prefer this method over hormonal contraception to avoid adverse effects such as depression, mood swings, vaginal dryness, decreased libido, weight gain, and headaches, among others.  It has no direct monetary cost, requires no artificial devices, has no physical side effects, can be practiced without a prescription or medical consultation, and provides no barriers to stimulation.

== Disadvantages ==

Compared to the other common reversible methods of contraception such as IUDs, hormonal contraceptives and male condoms, coitus interruptus is less effective at preventing pregnancy.&lt;ref name=&quot;cont tech 18&quot; /&gt;  As a result, it is also less cost-effective than many more effective methods: although the method itself has little direct cost, users have a greater chance of incurring the risks and expenses of either abortion or pregnancy and child-birth.  Only models that assume all couples practice perfect use of the method find cost savings associated with the choice of withdrawal as a birth control method.&lt;ref name=Trusell95&gt;{{cite journal|journal = American Journal of Public Health|title=Economic value of contraception|author = James Trusell|date = April 1995|volume = 85|issue = 4|pages= 494–503|url=http://www.ajph.org/cgi/reprint/85/4/494.pdf|doi = 10.2105/AJPH.85.4.494|pmid = 7702112|last2 = Leveque|first2 = JA|last3 = Koenig|first3 = JD|last4 = London|first4 = R|last5 = Borden|first5 = S|last6 = Henneberry|first6 = J|last7 = Laguardia|first7 = KD|last8 = Stewart|first8 = F|last9 = Wilson|first9 = TG|pmc = 1615115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The method is largely ineffective in the prevention of [[STDs]], like [[HIV]], since [[pre-ejaculate]] may carry viral particles or bacteria which may infect the partner if this fluid comes in contact with mucous membranes.  However, a reduction in the volume of bodily fluids exchanged during intercourse may reduce the likelihood of disease transmission compared to using no method due to the smaller number of pathogens present.&lt;ref name=&quot;HIV study&quot; /&gt;

The method may be difficult for some couples to use. The interruption of intercourse may leave some couples sexually frustrated or dissatisfied.&lt;!--
 --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Coitus Interruptus (Withdrawal) |work=Abstinence &amp; Natural Birth Control Methods |publisher=Sexually Transmitted Disease Resource |year=2006 |url=http://www.sexual-health-resource.org/natural_birth_control.htm#withdrawal |accessdate=2006-09-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Masters and Johnson]] considered withdrawal as a means to developing [[sexual dysfunction|sexual problems]], e.g. [[premature ejaculation]] and [[erectile dysfunction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Masters, W.H., &amp; Johnson, V.E.|year=1970|title=Human sexual inadequacy|location=Boston|publisher=Little, Brown and Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prevalence ==
Worldwide, 3% of women of childbearing age rely on withdrawal as their primary method of contraception.  Regional popularity of the method varies widely, from a low of 1% on the African continent to 16% in Western Asia. (Data from surveys during the late 1990s).&lt;!--

In the United States, studies have indicated 56% of women of reproductive age have had a partner use withdrawal by 2002 only 2.5% were using withdrawal as their primary method of contraception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chandra |first1=A |last2=Martinez |first2=GM |last3=Mosher |first3=WD |last4=Abma |first4=JC |last5=Jones |first5=J |title=Fertility, Family Planning, and Reproductive Health of U.S. Women: Data From the 2002 National Survey of Family Growth |publisher=National Center for Health Statistics | journal = Vital Health Stat | volume = 23 | issue = 25 |year=2005 |url=http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/series/sr_23/sr23_025.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2007-05-20 }} See Tables 53 and 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

A leading exponent of withdrawal in the mid-nineteenth century was the [[Oneida community]] in New York.  To minimize the incidence of pregnancy, teenage males were not permitted to engage in [[sexual intercourse]] except with [[postmenopausal]] women until such time as they mastered the withdrawal technique.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}

A '''condom''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|k|ɒ|n|d|əm}} or {{IPAc-en|uk|ˈ|k|ɒ|n|d|ɒ|m}}) is a [[Barrier contraception|barrier device]] most commonly used during [[sexual intercourse]] to reduce the probability of [[pregnancy]] and spreading [[sexually transmitted diseases]] (STDs—such as [[gonorrhea]], [[syphilis]], and [[HIV]]). It is put on a man's erect [[penis]] and physically blocks ejaculated semen from entering the body of a sexual partner. Because condoms are waterproof, elastic, and durable, they are also used in a variety of secondary applications. These include collection of semen for use in infertility treatment as well as non-sexual uses such as creating waterproof microphones and protecting rifle barrels from clogging.

In the modern age, condoms are most often made from [[latex]], but some are made from other materials such as [[polyurethane]], [[polyisoprene]], or lamb intestine. A [[female condom]] is also available, most often made of polyurethane. As a method of [[birth control]], male condoms have the advantage of being inexpensive, easy to use, having few side effects, and of offering protection against sexually transmitted diseases. 

However, according to a study in the Sexually Transmitted Diseases Journal of the American Sexually Transmitted Diseases Association condoms have a breakage rate of 2.3% and a slippage rate of 1.3% which &quot;may translate into a high risk for individuals who are very sexually active.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sexually Transmitted Diseases&quot;&gt;{{cite article| last=Macaluso| first=Maurizio MD, DrPH| title=Mechanical Failure of the Latex Condom in a Cohort of Women at High STD Risk | publisher=Wolters Kluwer Health | date=1999-09-01 | accessdate=2011-03-13 | url=http://journals.lww.com/stdjournal/Fulltext/1999/09000/Mechanical_Failure_of_the_Latex_Condom_in_a_Cohort.6.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; With proper knowledge and application technique—and use at every act of intercourse—women whose partners use male condoms experience a 2% per-year pregnancy rate with perfect use and a 15% per-year pregnancy rate with typical use.&lt;ref name=&quot;Summary table of contraceptive efficacy&quot;&gt;{{cite article| last=Trussell| first=J| title=Contraceptive efficacy | publisher=Ardent Media | date=2007 | accessdate=2011-03-13 | url=http://www.contraceptivetechnology.org/table.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Condoms have been used for at least 400 years. Since the 19th century, they have been one of the most popular methods of contraception in the world. While widely accepted in modern times, condoms have generated some controversy, primarily over what role they should play in [[sex education]] classes. They are considered unacceptable in almost all situations by certain religions, notably the [[Catholic_teachings_on_sexual_morality#Use_of_condoms|Catholic church]].

Condoms interfere with the process of [[paternal tolerance]], by which exposure of a woman's immune system to semen during unprotected sex may decrease the risk of [[pregnancy complications]] in subsequent pregnancies.&lt;ref name=NewScientist&gt;{{cite news | last=Fox | first=Douglas | title=Gentle Persuasion | publisher=The New Scientist | date=2002-02-09 | accessdate=2007-06-17 | url=http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg17323294.200-gentle-persuasion.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|History of condoms}}

=== Before the 19th century ===
Whether condoms were used in ancient civilizations is debated by archaeologists and historians.&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot;&gt;{{cite book | first=Aine | last=Collier | year=2007 | title=The Humble Little Condom: A History | publisher=Prometheus Books | location=Amherst, NY | isbn=978-1-59102-556-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|11}} In ancient Egypt, Greece, and Rome, pregnancy prevention was generally seen as a woman's responsibility, and the only well documented contraception methods were female-controlled devices.&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|17,23}} In Asia before the 15th century, some use of [[glans]] condoms (devices covering only the head of the penis) is recorded. Condoms seem to have been used for contraception, and to have been known only by members of the upper classes. In China, glans condoms may have been made of oiled silk paper, or of lamb intestines. In Japan, they were made of tortoise shell or animal horn.&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|60-1}}

In 16th century Italy, [[Gabriele Falloppio]] wrote a treatise on [[syphilis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|51,54-5}} The earliest documented strain of syphilis, first appearing in Europe in a 1490s outbreak, caused severe symptoms and often death within a few months of contracting the disease.&lt;ref name=Scars_of_Venus&gt;{{cite book | author=Oriel, JD | title=The Scars of Venus: A History of Venereology | location=London | publisher= Springer-Verlag | year=1994 |isbn=0-387-19844-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Diamond1&gt;{{cite book | author=Diamond, Jared | year=1997 | title=Guns, Germs and Steel | location=New York | publisher=W.W. Norton | page=210 |isbn=0-393-03891-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Falloppio's treatise is the earliest uncontested description of condom use: it describes linen sheaths soaked in a chemical solution and allowed to dry before use. The cloths he described were sized to cover the [[Glans penis|glans]] of the penis, and were held on with a ribbon.&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|51,54-5}}&lt;ref name=pai&gt;{{cite web |title=Special Topic: History of Condom Use |publisher=Population Action International |year=2002 |url=http://www.populationaction.org/Publications/Reports/Condoms_Count/Special_Topic_History_of_Condom_Use.shtml |accessdate=2008-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Falloppio claimed that an experimental trial of the linen sheath demonstrated protection against syphilis.&lt;ref name=&quot;youssef&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Youssef |first=H |date=1 April 1993|title=The history of the condom | journal = Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine | volume = 86 |pages=226–228 | accessdate=2008-06-03 | pmid = 7802734|issue=4|pmc=1293956}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After this, the use of penis coverings to protect from disease is described in a wide variety of literature throughout Europe. The first indication that these devices were used for birth control, rather than disease prevention, is the 1605 theological publication ''De iustitia et iure'' (On justice and law) by Catholic theologian [[Leonardus Lessius]], who condemned them as immoral.&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|56}} In 1666, the English Birth Rate Commission attributed a recent downward fertility rate to use of &quot;condons&quot;, the first documented use of that word (or any similar spelling).&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|66-8}}

[[File:Condom 1900.jpg|left|thumb|A condom made from animal intestine circa 1900.]]
In addition to linen, condoms during the [[Renaissance]] were made out of intestines and bladder. In the late 15th century, Dutch traders introduced condoms made from &quot;fine leather&quot; to Japan. Unlike the horn condoms used previously, these leather condoms covered the entire penis.&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|61}}

[[File:Condoomgebruik in de 19e eeuw.png|right|thumb|170px|[[Giacomo Casanova]] tests his condom for holes by inflating it]]

[[Giacomo Casanova|Casanova]] in the 18th century was one of the first reported using &quot;assurance caps&quot; to prevent impregnating his mistresses.&lt;ref&gt;Fryer P. (1965) 'the Birth controllers', London: Secker and Warburg and Dingwall EJ. (1953) 'Early contraceptive sheaths' BMJ, Jan 1: 40-1 in Lewis M. 'A Brief history of condoms' in Mindel A. (2000) 'Condoms', BMJ books&lt;/ref&gt; 

From at least the 18th century, condom use was opposed in some legal, religious, and medical circles for essentially the same reasons that are given today: condoms reduce the likelihood of pregnancy, which some thought immoral or undesirable for the nation; they do not provide full protection against sexually transmitted infections, while belief in their protective powers was thought to encourage sexual promiscuity; and they are not used consistently due to inconvenience, expense, or loss of sensation.&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|73,86-8,92}}

Despite some opposition, the condom market grew rapidly. In the 18th century, condoms were available in a variety of qualities and sizes, made from either linen treated with chemicals, or &quot;skin&quot; (bladder or intestine softened by treatment with [[sulfur]] and [[lye]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|94-5}} They were sold at pubs, barbershops, chemist shops, open-air markets, and at the theater throughout Europe and Russia.&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|90-2,97,104}} They later spread to America, although in every place there were generally used only by the middle and upper classes, due to both expense and lack of sex education.&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|116-21}}

=== 1800 through 1920s ===
The early 19th century saw contraceptives promoted to the poorer classes for the first time. Writers on contraception tended to prefer other methods of birth control. Feminists of this time period wanted birth control to be exclusively in the hands of women, and disapproved of male-controlled methods such as the condom.&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|129,152-3}} Other writers cited both the expense of condoms and their unreliability (they were often riddled with holes, and often fell off or broke), but they discussed condoms as a good option for some, and as the only contraceptive that also protected from disease.&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|88,90,125,129-30}} 

Many countries passed laws impeding the manufacture and promotion of contraceptives.&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|144,163-4,168-71,193}} In spite of these restrictions, condoms were promoted by traveling lecturers and in newspaper advertisements, using euphemisms in places where such ads were illegal.&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|127,130-2,138,146-7}} Instructions on how to make condoms at home were distributed in the United States and Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|126,136}} Despite social and legal opposition, at the end of the 19th century the condom was the Western world's most popular birth control method.&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|173-4}}

[[File:Surgeon Sage Says.jpg|left|thumb|During World War I, the U.S. military was the only one that did not promote condom use. Posters such as these were intended to promote abstinence.]]
Beginning in the second half of the 19th century, American rates of sexually transmitted diseases skyrocketed. Causes cited by historians include effects of the [[American Civil War]], and the ignorance of prevention methods promoted by the [[Comstock laws]].&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|137-8,159}} To fight the growing epidemic, sex education classes were introduced to public schools for the first time, teaching about venereal diseases and how they were transmitted. They generally taught that abstinence was the only way to avoid sexually transmitted diseases.&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|179-80}} Condoms were not promoted for disease prevention because the medical community and moral watchdogs considered STDs to be punishment for sexual misbehavior. The stigma against victims of these diseases was so great that many hospitals refused to treat people who had syphilis.&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|176}}

The German military was the first to promote condom use among its soldiers, beginning in the later 19th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|169,181}} Early 20th century experiments by the American military concluded that providing condoms to soldiers significantly lowered rates of sexually transmitted diseases.&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|180-3}} During [[World War I]], the United States and (at the beginning of the war only) Britain were the only countries with soldiers in Europe who did not provide condoms and promote their use.&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|187-90}}

In the decades after World War I, there remained social and legal obstacles to condom use throughout the U.S. and Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|208-10}} Founder of psychoanalysis [[Sigmund Freud]] opposed all methods of birth control on the grounds that their failure rates were too high. Freud was especially opposed to the condom because he thought it cut down on sexual pleasure. Some feminists continued to oppose male-controlled contraceptives such as condoms. In 1920 the Church of England's [[Lambeth Conferences#Sixth Conference (1920)|Lambeth Conference]] condemned all &quot;unnatural means of conception avoidance.&quot; London's Bishop [[Arthur Winnington-Ingram]] complained of the huge number of condoms discarded in alleyways and parks, especially after weekends and holidays.&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|211-2}} 

However, European militaries continued to provide condoms to their members for disease protection, even in countries where they were illegal for the general population.&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|213-4}} Through the 1920s, catchy names and slick packaging became an increasingly important marketing technique for many consumer items, including condoms and cigarettes.&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|197}} Quality testing became more common, involving filling each condom with air followed by one of several methods intended to detect loss of pressure.&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|204,206,221-2}} Worldwide, condom sales doubled in the 1920s.&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|210}}

=== Rubber and manufacturing advances ===
In 1839, [[Charles Goodyear]] discovered a way of processing natural [[rubber]], which is too stiff when cold and too soft when warm, in such a way as to make it elastic. This proved to have advantages for the manufacture of condoms; unlike the sheeps' gut condoms, they could stretch and did not tear quickly when used. The [[vulcanized rubber|rubber vulcanization]] process was patented by Goodyear in 1844.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Reprinted from ''India Rubber World'' |title=CHARLES GOODYEAR—The life and discoveries of the inventor of vulcanized India rubber | journal = Scientific American Supplement | issue = 787 |publisher=Munn &amp; Co.  |location=New York  |date= 1891-01-31 |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/14009 |accessdate=2008-06-08}}&lt;br /&gt;

 --&gt;&lt;ref name=billy&gt;{{cite web |title=Rubbers haven't always been made of rubber |work=Billy Boy: The excitingly different condom |url=http://www.billy-boy.com/english/info/ |accessdate=2006-09-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest rubber condoms had a seam and were as thick as a bicycle inner tube. Besides this type, small rubber condoms covering only the [[glans]] were often used in England and the United States. There was more risk of losing them and if the rubber ring was too tight, it would constrict the penis. This type of condom was the original &quot;capote&quot; (French for condom), perhaps because of its resemblance to a woman's bonnet worn at that time, also called a [[capote]]. 

For many decades, rubber condoms were manufactured by wrapping strips of raw rubber around penis-shaped molds, then dipping the wrapped molds in a chemical solution to cure the rubber.&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|148}} In 1912, a Polish Jew named [[Julius Fromm]] developed a new, improved manufacturing technique for condoms: dipping glass molds into a raw rubber solution.&lt;ref name=&quot;billy&quot; /&gt; Called ''cement dipping'', this method required adding gasoline or benzene to the rubber to make it liquid.&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|200}} [[Latex]], rubber suspended in water, was invented in 1920. Latex condoms required less labor to produce than cement-dipped rubber condoms, which had to be smoothed by rubbing and trimming. The use of water to suspend the rubber instead of [[gasoline]] and [[benzene]] eliminated the fire hazard previously associated with all condom factories. Latex condoms also performed better for the consumer: they were stronger and thinner than rubber condoms, and had a shelf life of five years (compared to three months for rubber).&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|199-200}} 

Until the twenties, all condoms were individually hand-dipped by semiskilled workers. Throughout the decade of the 1920s, advances in the automation of the condom assembly line were made. The first fully automated line was patented in 1930. Major condom manufacturers bought or leased conveyor systems, and small manufacturers were driven out of business.&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|201-3}} The skin condom, now significantly more expensive than the latex variety, became restricted to a niche high-end market.&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|220}}

=== 1930 to present ===
In 1930 the Anglican Church's [[Lambeth Conferences#Seventh Conference (1930)|Lambeth Conference]] sanctioned the use of birth control by married couples. In 1931 the [[National Council of Churches|Federal Council of Churches]] in the U.S. issued a similar statement.&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|227}} The Roman Catholic Church responded by issuing the encyclical ''[[Casti Connubii]]'' affirming its opposition to all contraceptives, a stance it has never reversed.&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|228-9}}

In the 1930s, legal restrictions on condoms began to be relaxed.&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|216,226,234}}&lt;ref name=&quot;note&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Biographical Note |work=The Margaret Sanger Papers |publisher=Sophia Smith Collection, Smith College, Northampton, Mass. |year=1995 |url=http://asteria.fivecolleges.edu/findaids/sophiasmith/mnsss43_bioghist.html |accessdate=2006-10-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; But during this period [[Italian fascism|Fascist Italy]] and [[Nazi Germany]] increased restrictions on condoms (limited sales as disease preventatives were still allowed).&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|252,254-5}} During the Depression, condom lines by Schmid gained in popularity. Schmid still used the cement-dipping method of manufacture which had two advantages over the latex variety. Firstly, cement-dipped condoms could be safely used with oil-based [[Personal lubricant|lubricants]]. Secondly, while less comfortable, these older-style rubber condoms could be reused and so were more economical, a valued feature in hard times.&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|217-9}} More attention was brought to quality issues in the 1930s, and the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] began to regulate the quality of condoms sold in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|223-5}}

Throughout [[World War II]], condoms were not only distributed to male U.S. military members, but also heavily promoted with films, posters, and lectures.&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|236-8,259}} European and Asian militaries on both sides of the conflict also provided condoms to their troops throughout the war, even Germany which outlawed all civilian use of condoms in 1941.&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|252-4,257-8}} In part because condoms were readily available, soldiers found a number of [[#Other uses|non-sexual uses]] for the devices, many of which continue to this day.

After the war, condom sales continued to grow. From 1955–1965, 42% of Americans of reproductive age relied on condoms for birth control. In Britain from 1950–1960, 60% of married couples used condoms. The [[combined oral contraceptive pill|birth control pill]] became the world's most popular method of birth control in the years after its 1960 début, but condoms remained a strong second. The U.S. [[United States Agency for International Development|Agency for International Development]] pushed condom use in developing countries to help solve the &quot;world population crises&quot;: by 1970 hundreds of millions of condoms were being used each year in India alone.&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|267-9,272-5}} (This number has grown in recent decades: in 2004, the government of India purchased 1.9 billion condoms for distribution at family planning clinics.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = AP | last = Sharma | title = Annual Report of the Tariff Commission | page = 9 | publisher = India government | year = 2006 | url = http://tc.nic.in/areports/annualreport-2005-06.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2009-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 20th century the invention of plastic and other man-made materials did not lead to an improvement in the quality of condoms. However the deterioration of the rubber became less rapid. Condoms became not only thinner but also more reliable. In 1995, plastic condoms went on the market in the USA.

In the 1960s and 1970s quality regulations tightened,&lt;ref&gt;Collier, pp.267,285&lt;/ref&gt; and more legal barriers to condom use were removed.&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|276-9}} In Ireland, legal condom sales were allowed for the first time in 1978.&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|329-30}} Advertising, however was one area that continued to have legal restrictions. In the late 1950s, the American [[National Association of Broadcasters]] banned condom advertisements from national television: this policy remained in place until 1979.&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|273-4,285}}

After learning in the early 1980s that [[AIDS]] can be a sexually transmitted infection,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=A Cluster of Kaposi's Sarcoma and Pneumocystis carinii Pneumonia among Homosexual Male Residents of Los Angeles and range Counties, California | journal = Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report | volume = 31 | issue = 23 |pages=305–7 |publisher= Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |date= 1982-06-18 |url=http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00001114.htm |accessdate=2008-06-15 |pmid=6811844 |author1=Centers for Disease Control (CDC)}}&lt;/ref&gt; the use of condoms was encouraged to prevent transmission of [[HIV]]. Despite opposition by some political, religious, and other figures, national condom promotion campaigns occurred in the U.S. and Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|299,301,306-7,312-8}} These campaigns increased condom use significantly.&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|309-17}}

Due to increased demand and greater social acceptance, condoms began to be sold in a wider variety of retail outlets, including in supermarkets and in discount department stores such as [[Wal-Mart]].&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|305}} Condom sales increased every year until 1994, when media attention to the AIDS pandemic began to decline.&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|303-4}} The phenomenon of decreasing use of condoms as disease preventatives has been called ''prevention fatigue'' or ''[[condom fatigue]]''.

In March 2010, Switzerland announced that its government was planning to manufacture smaller condoms meant for boys of 12–14 years old. Called the Hotshot, the condom has been produced after government research showed 12 to 14-year-olds did not use sufficient protection when having sex. A standard condom has a diameter of 2&amp;nbsp;inches (5.2&amp;nbsp;cm) in comparison with the Hotshot's diameter of 1.7&amp;nbsp;inches (4.5&amp;nbsp;cm). Both are the same length – 7.4&amp;nbsp;inches (19&amp;nbsp;cm). According to a German study of 12,970 13 to 20-year-olds, a quarter of those surveyed said a standard condom was too large. Family planning groups and the Swiss Aids Federation campaigned to have the Hotshot produced after a number of studies, including the government study researched at the Centre for Development and Personality Psychology at Basel University&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/7361181/Extra-small-condoms-for-12-year-old-boys-go-on-sale-in-Switzerland.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | title=Extra small condoms for 12 year-old boys go on sale in Switzerland  				 				 					Extra small condoms for boys as young as 12 are going on sale in Switzerland. | first=Alexandra | last=Williams | date=2010-03-03 | accessdate=2010-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology and other terms ==
The term ''condom'' first appears in the early 18th century. Its etymology is unknown.
In popular tradition, the invention and naming of the condom came to be attributed to an associate of England's [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]], one &quot;Dr. Condom&quot; or &quot;Earl of Condom&quot;. There is however '''no evidence''' of the existence of such a person, and condoms had been used for over one hundred years before King Charles II ascended to the throne.&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|54,68}}

A variety of unproven Latin etymologies have been proposed, including ''condon'' (receptacle),&lt;!--

== Varieties ==

Most condoms have a reservoir tip or teat end, making it easier to accommodate the man's ejaculate. Condoms come in different sizes, from oversized to snug and they also come in a variety of surfaces intended to stimulate the user's partner. Condoms are usually supplied with a [[Personal lubricant|lubricant]] coating to facilitate penetration, while flavored condoms are principally used for oral sex. As mentioned above, most condoms are made of latex, but [[#Synthetic|polyurethane]] and [[#Lambskin|lambskin]] condoms are also widely available.

==== Natural latex ====
[[File:Condom unrolled durex.jpg|thumb|375px|An unrolled latex condom]]

Latex has outstanding elastic properties: Its [[tensile strength]] exceeds 30&amp;nbsp;MPa, and latex condoms may be stretched in excess of 800% before breaking.&lt;!--
 --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=|title=Relationship of condom strength to failure during use | journal = PIACT Prod News | volume = 2 | issue = 2 |pages=1–2 |year=1980 | pmid = 12264044 |author1=Program for the Introduction and Adaptation of Contraceptive Technology PIACT}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990 the [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] set standards for condom production (ISO 4074, Natural latex rubber condoms), and the [[European Union|EU]] followed suit with its [[European Committee for Standardization|CEN]] standard (Directive 93/42/EEC concerning medical devices). Every latex condom is tested for holes with an electrical current. If the condom passes, it is rolled and packaged. In addition, a portion of each batch of condoms is subject to water leak and air burst testing.&lt;!--

While the advantages of latex have made it the most popular condom material, it does have some drawbacks. Latex condoms are damaged when used with oil-based substances as [[Personal lubricant|lubricants]], such as [[petroleum jelly]], [[cooking oil]], [[baby oil]], [[mineral oil]], [[skin lotion]]s, [[Sunscreen|suntan lotions]], [[cold cream]]s, [[butter]] or [[margarine]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://info.k4health.org/pubs/ect/chapter11.pdf Essentials of Contraceptive Technology &gt; Chapter 11 Condoms] From the Knowledge for Health Project, The Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Retrieved July, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Contact with oil makes latex condoms more likely to break or slip off due to loss of elasticity caused by the oils.&lt;!--

In May 2009 the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] granted approval for the production of condoms composed of [[Vytex]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=FDA Clearance for Envy Natural Rubber Latex Condom Made with Vytex NRL |publisher=Vystar |date=2009-05-06 |url=http://www.vytex.com/BizDocs/R-EnvyFDA_Clearance.pdf |accessdate=2009-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; latex that has been treated to remove 90% of the [[antibody generator|proteins responsible for allergic reactions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=How Vytex Works |publisher=Vystar |year=2009 |url=http://www.vytex.com/Consumers/howvytexworks.aspx?pageid=C8 |accessdate=2009-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; An allergen-free condom made of synthetic latex (polyisoprene) is also available.&lt;ref name=&quot;isoprenepr&quot; /&gt;

==== Synthetic ====
The most common non-latex condoms are made from [[polyurethane]]. Condoms may also be made from other synthetic materials, such as [[AT-10 resin]], and most recently [[polyisoprene]].&lt;ref name=&quot;isoprenepr&quot;&gt;{{cite press release | title = Lifestyles Condoms Introduces Polyisoprene Non-latex | publisher = HealthNewsDigest.com | date = 2008-07-31 | url = http://healthnewsdigest.com/news/New_Product_460/Lifestyles_Condoms_printer.shtml | accessdate = 2008-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Polyurethane condoms tend to be the same width and thickness as latex condoms, with most polyurethane condoms between 0.04&amp;nbsp;mm and 0.07&amp;nbsp;mm thick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Condoms |work=Condom Statistics and Sizes |date=2008-03-12 |url=http://www.condomman.com/articles/condom-use/all-you-need-to-know-on-condom-statistics-and-sizes/ |accessdate=2008-03-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Polyurethane is also the material of many [[female condom]]s.

Polyurethane can be considered better than latex in several ways: it conducts heat better than latex, is not as sensitive to temperature and ultraviolet light (and so has less rigid storage requirements and a longer shelf life), can be used with oil-based [[Personal lubricant|lubricants]], is less allergenic than latex, and does not have an odor.&lt;ref name=&quot;nonlatex&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title=Nonlatex vs Latex Condoms: An Update | journal = The Contraception Report | volume = 14 | issue = 2 |publisher=Contraception Online |month=September | year=2003 |url=http://www.contraceptiononline.org/contrareport/article01.cfm?art=243 |accessdate=2006-08-14 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060926035226/http://www.contraceptiononline.org/contrareport/article01.cfm?art=243 |archivedate = September 26, 2006|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polyurethane condoms have gained [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] approval for sale in the United States as an effective method of contraception and HIV prevention, and under laboratory conditions have been shown to be just as effective as latex for these purposes.&lt;ref name=&quot;AlicePolyLatex&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Are polyurethane condoms as effective as latex ones? |publisher=[[Go Ask Alice!]] |date=February 22, 2005 |url=http://www.goaskalice.columbia.edu/1842.html |accessdate=2007-05-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, polyurethane condoms are less elastic than latex ones, and may be more likely to slip or break than latex,&lt;ref name=&quot;nonlatex&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AlicePoly&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Prefers polyurethane protection |publisher=[[Go Ask Alice!]]  |date=March 4, 2005 |url=http://www.goaskalice.columbia.edu/1203.html |accessdate=2007-05-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and are more expensive. 

Polyisoprene is a synthetic version of natural rubber latex. While significantly more expensive,&lt;ref name=&quot;isopreneglove&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Polyisoprene Surgical Gloves | publisher = SurgicalGlove.net | year = 2008 | url = http://www.surgicalglove.net/polyisoprene.html | accessdate = 2008-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; it has the advantages of latex (such as being softer and more elastic than polyurethane condoms)&lt;ref name=&quot;isoprenepr&quot; /&gt; without the protein which is responsible for latex allergies.&lt;ref name=&quot;isopreneglove&quot; /&gt;

==== Lambskin ====
Condoms made from [[sheep]] [[intestine]]s, labeled &quot;lambskin&quot;, are also available, although they have been clinically shown not to necessarily keep out [[STD]]s compared to latex because of pores in the material, which are thought to be large enough to allow infectious agents to pass through; sperm is still blocked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Boston Women's Health Book Collective |title=Our Bodies, Ourselves: A New Edition for a New Era |publisher=Touchstone |location=New York, NY |year=2005 |isbn=0-7432-5611-5 |page=333}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lambskin provides more sensation and are less allergenic than latex, but because of their comparatively less-safe nature, other hypoallergenic materials such as [[polyurethane]] are recommended for latex-allergic users and/or partners. Lambskin condoms are also significantly more expensive than other types, similar to polyurethane's comparative expense to latex.

=== Spermicidal ===
Some latex condoms are lubricated at the manufacturer with a small amount of a [[nonoxynol-9]], a [[spermicide|spermicidal chemical]]. According to [[Consumer Reports]], condoms lubricated with spermicide have no additional benefit in preventing pregnancy, have a shorter shelf life, and may cause [[urinary tract infection|urinary-tract infections]] in women.&lt;!-- 
--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Condoms: Extra protection |work=ConsumerReports.org |month=February | year=2005 |url=http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/cu-press-room/pressroom/archive/2005/02/eng0502tcv.htm?resultPageIndex=1&amp;resultIndex=1&amp;searchTerm=condom |accessdate=2009-07-26 }} {{dead link| date=June 2010 | bot=DASHBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, application of separately packaged spermicide ''is'' believed to increase the contraceptive efficacy of condoms.&lt;ref name=&quot;simultaneous&quot; /&gt; 

Nonoxynol-9 was once believed to offer additional protection against STDs (including HIV) but recent studies have shown that, with frequent use, nonoxynol-9 may increase the risk of HIV transmission.&lt;!--
 --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Nonoxynol-9 and the Risk of HIV Transmission |work=HIV/AIDS Epi Update |publisher=Health Canada, Centre for Infectious Disease Prevention and Control |month=April | year=2003 |url=http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/publicat/epiu-aepi/hiv-vih/nonoxynol-eng.php |accessdate=2006-08-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Health Organization]] says that spermicidally lubricated condoms should no longer be promoted. However, it recommends using a [[nonoxynol-9]] lubricated condom over no condom at all.&lt;!--
 --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Nonoxynol-9 ineffective in preventing HIV infection |work=World Health Organization |year=2006 |url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/notes/release55/en/index.html |accessdate=2009-07-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2005, nine condom manufacturers have stopped manufacturing condoms with nonoxynol-9 and [[Planned Parenthood]] has discontinued the distribution of condoms so lubricated.&lt;!--

=== Textured ===
Textured condoms include studded and ribbed condoms which can provide extra sensations to both partners. The studs or ribs can be located on the inside, outside, or both; alternatively, they are located in specific sections to provide directed stimulation to either the [[g-spot]] or [[Frenulum of prepuce of penis|frenulum]]. Many textured condoms which advertise &quot;mutual pleasure&quot; also are bulb-shaped at the top, to provide extra stimulation to the male.&lt;ref name=&quot;about&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Condom Types: A look at different condom styles |url=http://contraception.about.com/od/malecondom/tp/CondomTypes.htm |last=Stacey |first=Dawn |authorurl=http://contraception.about.com/bio/Dawn-Stacey-M-Ed-LMHC-24387.htm |accessdate=2008-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some women experience irritation during vaginal intercourse with studded condoms.

=== Other ===

The [[Anti-rape device|anti-rape condom]] is another variation designed to be worn by women. It is designed to cause pain to the attacker, hopefully allowing the victim a chance to escape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Rape-aXe: Questions and answers |publisher=Rape-aXe |year=2006 |url=http://www.antirape.co.za/questions.htm |accessdate=2009-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[#Infertility treatment|collection condom]] is used to collect semen for fertility treatments or sperm analysis. These condoms are designed to maximize sperm life.

Some condom-like devices are intended for entertainment only, such [[novelties|novelty]] condoms may not provide protection against pregnancy and STDs.&lt;ref name=&quot;planned parenthood&quot;/&gt;

== Female condom ==
[[File:Préservatif féminin.jpg|thumb|right|Female condom]]
{{main|Female condom}}

Male condoms have a tight ring to form a seal around the penis while female condoms typically have a large stiff ring to keep them from slipping into the [[body orifice]]. The Female Health Company produced a female condom that was initially made of polyurethane, but newer versions are made of [[nitrile rubber|nitrile]]. Medtech Products produces a female condom made of latex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avert.org/female-condom.htm|title=The Female Condom|publisher=AVERT|accessdate=2009-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effectiveness ==
=== In preventing pregnancy ===
{{see also|Comparison of birth control methods#Effectiveness of various methods|l1=Comparison of birth control methods: Effectiveness of various methods}}
The effectiveness of condoms, as of most forms of [[birth control|contraception]], can be assessed two ways. ''Perfect use'' or ''method'' effectiveness rates only include people who use condoms properly and consistently. ''Actual use'', or ''typical use'' effectiveness rates are of all condom users, including those who use condoms incorrectly or do not use condoms at every act of intercourse. Rates are generally presented for the first year of use.&lt;ref name=&quot;hatcher&quot;&gt;{{cite book |first=RA |last=Hatcher |coauthors=Trussel, J; Nelson, AL; et al. |year=2007 |title=Contraceptive Technology |edition=19th |publisher=Ardent Media | location=New York | isbn=1-59708-001-2 | url=http://www.contraceptivetechnology.com/table.html |accessdate=2009-07-26|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080531095926/http://www.contraceptivetechnology.com/table.html |archivedate = May 31, 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most commonly the [[Pearl Index]] is used to calculate effectiveness rates, but some studies use [[decrement table]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;kippley&quot;&gt;{{cite book | first=John | last=Kippley | coauthors=Kippley, Sheila | year=1996 | title=The Art of Natural Family Planning | edition=4th addition | publisher=The Couple to Couple League | location=Cincinnati, OH | isbn=0-926412-13-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|141}}

{{see also|Safe sex}}
Condoms are widely recommended for the prevention of [[sexually transmitted diseases]] (STDs). They have been shown to be effective in reducing infection rates in both men and women. While not perfect, the condom is effective at reducing the transmission of organisms that cause [[AIDS]], [[Herpes genitalis|genital herpes]], [[cervical cancer]], [[genital wart]]s, [[syphilis]], [[chlamydia infection|chlamydia]], [[gonorrhea]], and other diseases.&lt;ref name=&quot;planned parenthood&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Condom |publisher=Planned Parenthood | year=2008 |url=http://www.plannedparenthood.org/health-topics/birth-control/condom-10187.htm |accessdate=2007-11-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Condoms are often recommended as an adjunct to more effective birth control methods (such as [[IUD]]) in situations where STD protection is also desired.&lt;ref name=DualProtection&gt;{{cite journal|author=Cates, W., Steiner, M.

According to a 2000 report by the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH), correct and consistent use of latex condoms reduces the risk of [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]] transmission by approximately 85% relative to risk when unprotected, putting the seroconversion rate (infection rate) at 0.9 per 100 person-years with condom, down from 6.7 per 100 person-years.&lt;!--

The 2000 NIH review concluded that condom use significantly reduces the risk of [[gonorrhea]] for men.&lt;ref name=&quot;workshop&quot;/&gt; A 2006 study reports that proper condom use decreases the risk of transmission of [[human papillomavirus]] to women by approximately 70%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Winer, R; Hughes, J; Feng, Q; O'Reilly, S; Kiviat, N; Holmes, K; Koutsky, L |title=Condom use and the risk of genital human papillomavirus infection in young women  | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa053284|journal=N Engl J Med |volume=354 |issue=25 |pages=2645–54 |year=2006 |pmid=16790697 |url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/354/25/2645 |accessdate=2007-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study in the same year found consistent condom use was effective at reducing transmission of [[Herpes simplex virus|herpes simplex virus-2]] also known as genital [[Herpes simplex|herpes]], in both men and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wald |first=Anna |title=The Relationship between Condom Use and Herpes Simplex Virus Acquisition| journal = Annals of Internal Medicine| volume = 143|pages=707–713|year=2005 |pmid=16287791 | url=http://www.annals.org/cgi/content/full/143/10/707 |accessdate=2007-04-07 |last2=Langenberg |first2=AG |last3=Krantz |first3=E |last4=Douglas Jr |first4=JM |last5=Handsfield |first5=HH |last6=Dicarlo |first6=RP |last7=Adimora |first7=AA |last8=Izu |first8=AE |last9=Morrow |first9=RA |issue=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although a condom is effective in limiting exposure, some disease transmission may occur even with a condom. Infectious areas of the genitals, especially when symptoms are present, may not be covered by a condom, and as a result, some diseases can be transmitted by direct contact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Villhauer |first=Tanya |title=Condoms Preventing HPV? |publisher=University of Iowa Student Health Service/Health Iowa |date=2005-05-20 |url=http://www.uistudenthealth.com/question/default.aspx?q=738 |accessdate=2009-07-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary effectiveness issue with using condoms to prevent STDs, however, is inconsistent use.&lt;ref name=&quot;badnews&quot; /&gt;

Condoms may also be useful in treating potentially [[cervical cancer|precancerous cervical changes]]. Exposure to human papillomavirus, even in individuals already infected with the virus, appears to increase the risk of precancerous changes. The use of condoms helps promote regression of these changes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hogewoning2003&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hogewoning |first1=Cornelis J |last2=Bleeker |first2=MC |last3=van den Bruler |first3=AJ |last4=Voorhorst |first4=Feja J |last5=Snijders |first5=Peter JF |last6=Berkhof |first6=Johannes |last7=Westenend |first7=Pieter J |last8=Meijer |first8=Chris JLM |title=Condom use Promotes the Regression of Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia and Clearance of HPV: Randomized Clinical Trial | journal = International Journal of Cancer | volume = 107 |pages=811–816 |year=2003| pmid = 14566832 | doi = 10.1002/ijc.11474 |issue= 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, researchers in the UK suggest that a hormone in semen can aggravate existing cervical cancer, condom use during sex can prevent exposure to the hormone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Semen can worsen cervical cancer | date= | publisher=[[Medical Research Council (UK)]] | url =http://www.mrc.ac.uk/NewsViewsAndEvents/News/MRC002621 |work=|pages=|accessdate=2007-12-02 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Different modes of condom failure result in different levels of semen exposure. If a failure occurs during application, the damaged condom may be disposed of and a new condom applied before intercourse begins&amp;nbsp;— such failures generally pose no risk to the user.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Richters, J; Donovan, B; Gerofi, J |title=How often do condoms break or slip off in use? |journal=Int J STD AIDS |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=90–4 |year= 1993|pmid=8476971}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study found that semen exposure from a broken condom was about half that of unprotected intercourse; semen exposure from a slipped condom was about one-fifth that of unprotected intercourse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Walsh, T; Frezieres, R; Peacock, K; Nelson, A; Clark, V; Bernstein, L; Wraxall, B |title=Use of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) to measure semen exposure resulting from male condom failures: implications for contraceptive efficacy and the prevention of sexually transmitted disease |journal=Contraception |volume=67 |issue=2 |pages=139–50 |year=2003 |pmid=12586324 |doi=10.1016/S0010-7824(02)00478-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among people who intend condoms to be their form of birth control, pregnancy may occur when the user has sex without a condom. The person may have run out of condoms, or be traveling and not have a condom with them, or simply dislike the feel of condoms and decide to &quot;take a chance.&quot; This type of behavior is the primary cause of typical use failure (as opposed to method or perfect use failure).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Steiner, M; Cates, W; Warner, L |title=The real problem with male condoms is nonuse | journal = Sex Transm Dis | volume = 26 | issue = 8 |pages=459–62 |year=1999 | pmid = 10494937 | doi = 10.1097/00007435-199909000-00007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prevalence ==
The prevalence of condom use varies greatly between countries. Most surveys of contraceptive use are among married women, or women in informal unions. Japan has the highest rate of condom usage in the world: in that country, condoms account for almost 80% of contraceptive use by married women. On average, in developed countries, condoms are the most popular method of birth control: 28% of married contraceptive users rely on condoms. In the average less-developed country, condoms are less common: only 6-8% of married contraceptive users choose condoms.&lt;!--

Note: percent of married contraceptive users using condoms calculated by dividing % of married women using condoms by percent of married women using any method of contraception --&gt;

Condom use for disease prevention also varies. Among gay men in the United States, one survey found that 35% had used two condoms at the same time, a practice called &quot;double bagging&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wolitski, RJ; Halkitis, PN; Parsons, JT; Gómez, CA |title=Awareness and use of untested barrier methods by HIV-seropositive gay and bisexual men |journal=AIDS Educ Prev |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=291–301 |year=2001 |month=August |pmid=11565589 |doi= 10.1521/aeap.13.4.291.21430|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While intended to provide extra protection, double bagging actually [[#Causes of failure|increases the risk of condom failure]].

== Use ==
[[File:CondomUse2 alternative.jpg|thumb|How to put on a condom]]
Male condoms are usually packaged inside a foil wrapper, in a rolled-up form, and are designed to be applied to the tip of the penis and then unrolled over the [[erection|erect]] penis. It is important that some space be left in the tip of the condom so that semen has a place to collect; otherwise it may be forced out of the base of the device. After use, it is recommended the condom be wrapped in tissue or tied in a knot, then disposed of in a trash receptacle.&lt;ref name=&quot;AliceDisposal&quot; /&gt;

Some couples find that putting on a condom interrupts sex, although others incorporate condom application as part of their foreplay. Some men and women find the physical barrier of a condom dulls sensation. Advantages of dulled sensation can include prolonged erection and delayed ejaculation; disadvantages might include a loss of some sexual excitement.&lt;ref name=&quot;planned parenthood&quot; /&gt; Advocates of condom use also cite their advantages of being inexpensive, easy to use, and having few side effects.&lt;ref name=&quot;planned parenthood&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;fwhc&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Male Condom |publisher=Feminist Women's Health Center  |date=October 18, 2007 |url=http://www.fwhc.org/birth-control/condom.htm |accessdate=2007-11-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Role in sex education ===
Condoms are often used in [[sex education]] programs, because they have the capability to reduce the chances of pregnancy and the spread of some sexually transmitted diseases when used correctly. A recent [[American Psychological Association]] (APA) press release supported the inclusion of information about condoms in sex education, saying &quot;''comprehensive sexuality education programs... discuss the appropriate use of condoms''&quot;, and &quot;''promote condom use for those who are sexually active''.&quot;&lt;!--

In the United States, teaching about condoms in public schools is opposed by some religious organizations.&lt;!--

=== Infertility treatment {{anchor|Infertility treatment}} ===
&lt;!-- [[Conception device]] links to anchor Infertility treatment --&gt;
Common procedures in [[infertility]] treatment such as [[semen analysis]] and [[Artificial insemination|intrauterine insemination]] (IUI) require collection of semen samples. These are most commonly obtained through [[masturbation]], but an alternative to masturbation is use of a special ''collection condom'' to collect semen during sexual intercourse.

Collection condoms are made from silicone or polyurethane, as latex is somewhat harmful to sperm. Many men prefer collection condoms to masturbation, and some religions prohibit masturbation entirely. Also, compared with samples obtained from masturbation, semen samples from collection condoms have higher total sperm counts, sperm motility, and percentage of sperm with normal morphology. For this reason, they are believed to give more accurate results when used for semen analysis, and to improve the chances of pregnancy when used in procedures such as intracervical or intrauterine [[Artificial insemination|insemination]].&lt;!--

However, for fertiltiy treatments, a collection condom is only used to collect semen during [[sexual intercourse]] where the semen is provided by the woman's partner or by a private donor, and it will not be used where semen is produced at a sperm bank or fertility clinic. After collection, the semen must be transported in order to be processed and used. This in turn reduces the fecundity of the sperm. Specially designed containers can be used which may extend the life of the sperm and enable it to be transported to a clinic or a recipient woman.

''Condom therapy'' is sometimes prescribed to infertile couples when the female has high levels of antisperm antibodies. The theory is that preventing exposure to her partner's semen will lower her level of antisperm antibodies, and thus increase her chances of pregnancy when condom therapy is discontinued. However, condom therapy has not been shown to increase subsequent pregnancy rates.&lt;!--

The smuggler would then use a [[syringe]] to fill the tubing and condom with up to three [[liter]]s of raw alcohol, which the prisoner would then smuggle back into the camp. When back in the barracks, the other prisoners would suspend him upside down until all the spirit had been drained out.

== Debate and criticism ==
There do exist some criticisms of condoms both on the [[moral]] level and on the [[scientific]] level despite the many proven benefits of condoms by [[scientific consensus]] and sexual health experts, particularly over the last century when direct and concentrated research on condoms has increased.

===Criticism within sexual situations===

Condom criticism is not limited to external parties; sometimes the very people who use them have problems with them as well. An entirely subjective but still potentially notable criticism sometimes levelled at the male condom by partners, especially [[heterosexual]] partners, who are actually engaging in sexual activity while using them, has in recent history consisted of an aggregate of the following general ideas, or some combination thereof:

* &quot;Condoms are too heavy&quot;, i.e., their material significantly decreases sensation both in the [[penis]] and in the ability of the [[vagina]]'s walls to properly feel the penis, because of the material barrier. In general, this complaint has been responded to by condom manufacturers via the production of &quot;thin&quot; and even &quot;ultra-thin&quot; condom types; however, even the &quot;thin&quot; types are sometimes claimed by men or women (or both) to not &quot;feel as good&quot; as [[sexual intercourse]] without a condom.

* Some men genuinely cannot properly maintain an [[erection]] while a condom is on, even if they always are able to do so during sexual play without a condom. There are those who claim that men who experience this problem simply need to &quot;train themselves&quot; to maintain erections while attempting intercourse with a condom (such as by [[masturbating]] while wearing a condom, and other strategies), but some of these men counter that they are physically unable to do so regardless of how much they try.

* Some men can properly maintain an erection but cannot [[ejaculate]] with a condom on. This has the potential of defeating the purpose of using the condom in the first place, considering its main purpose during sexual intercourse is to prevent passage of [[semen]] into the vagina, and taking the condom off just before ejaculating essentially invalidates that purpose. A potential 'opposite' strategy, i.e. stimulating the penis to near-orgasm without a condom and then hurriedly applying the condom at the last possible moment before ejaculation, is typically either logistically impossible or prone to some other type of failure.

* [[Sociology|Sociologically]], the desire not to use condoms is sometimes culturally seen among [[post-feminist]] condom-accepting cultures as occurring almost exclusively in men rather than women; as involving 'male' perspectives; and as being essentially a personal aversion to condom use among males, while their female partners always or almost-always want to use condoms, at least by comparison. However, this view fails to take into account the reality that some women, on their own and from their own views, do not want to use condoms. Common justifications among such women include the idea that sexual intercourse without a condom is more [[sexual intimacy|intimate]]; that sex without a condom is &quot;uninterrupted&quot; whereas sex with a condom takes &quot;work&quot; and ruins [[sexual arousal|the mood]]; and perhaps more importantly, that sex with a condom either feels significantly less pleasurable or even actively irritates their vaginal walls and leaves the vagina sore and/or irritated whereas condomless sex does not.

The [[Roman Catholic Church]] opposes all sexual acts outside of marriage, as well as any sexual act in which the chance of successful conception has been reduced by [[direct and intentional]] acts (for example,, [[Sterilization (surgical procedure)|surgery to prevent conception]]) or foreign objects (for example,, condoms).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Humanæ Vitæ |author=[[Pope Paul VI]] |date=1968-07-25 |url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/paul_vi/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-vi_enc_25071968_humanae-vitae_en.html |accessdate=2009-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of condoms to prevent STD transmission is not specifically addressed by Catholic doctrine, and is currently a topic of debate among theologians and high-ranking Catholic authorities. A few, such as Belgian Cardinal [[Godfried Danneels]], believe the Catholic Church should actively support condoms used to prevent disease, especially serious diseases such as [[AIDS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Hooper |first1=John |last2=Osborn |first2=Andrew |title=Cardinal backs use of condoms |work=The Guardian |date=2004-01-13 |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2004/jan/13/religion.catholicism |accessdate=2009-08-26 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the majority view—including all statements from the Vatican—is that condom-promotion programs encourage promiscuity, thereby actually increasing STD transmission.&lt;!--

However, [[Federico Lombardi]], spokesman of the vatican, clarified that it applied to heterosexual and transsexual prostitutes, whether male or female, as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/24/world/europe/24pope.html | work=The New York Times | first1=Rachel | last1=Donadio | first2=Laurie | last2=Goodstein | title=Vatican Confirms Shift on Condoms as AIDS Prevention | date=2010-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; He did, however, also clarify that the vatican's principles on sexuality and preservatives had not been changed.

===Scientific and environmental===

More generally, some scientific researchers have expressed objective concern over certain ingredients sometimes added to condoms, notably [[talc]] and [[nitrosamine]]s. Dry dusting powders are applied to latex condoms before packaging to prevent the condom from sticking to itself when rolled up. Previously, talc was used by most manufacturers, but [[cornstarch]] is currently the most popular dusting powder.&lt;!--

Cornstarch is generally believed to be safe, however some researchers have raised concerns over its use as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;fhi4&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wright, H; Wheeler, J; Woods, J; Hesford, J; Taylor, P; Edlich, R |title=Potential toxicity of retrograde uterine passage of particulate matter |journal=J Long Term Eff Med Implants |volume=6 |issue=3–4 |pages=199–206 |year=1996 |pmid=10167361}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the large-scale use of disposable condoms has resulted in concerns over their environmental impact, like via [[littering]] and in [[landfills]], where they can eventually wind up in [[wildlife]] environments if not [[incinerated]] or otherwise permanently disposed of first. Polyurethane condoms in particular, given they are a form of [[plastic]], are not [[biodegradable]], and latex condoms take a very long time to break down. Experts, such as [[AVERT]], recommend condoms be disposed of in a garbage receptacle, as flushing them down the toilet (which some people do) may cause plumbing blockages and other problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;AliceDisposal&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Environmentally-friendly condom disposal |publisher=[[Go Ask Alice!]] |date=December 20, 2002 |url=http://www.goaskalice.columbia.edu/2311.html |accessdate=2007-10-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avert.org/condom.htm |title=Using Condoms, Condom Types &amp; Condom Sizes |publisher=AVERT |accessdate=2009-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plastic and foil wrappers condoms are packaged in are also not biodegradable. However, the benefits condoms offer are widely considered to offset their small landfill mass.&lt;ref name=&quot;AliceDisposal&quot; /&gt; Frequent condom or wrapper disposal in public areas such as a parks have been seen as a persistent litter problem.&lt;ref name=&quot;power&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Power |first=Robert |title=The black plastic bag of qualitative research | work = BMJ.com |url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/eletters/318/7175/48#1918 |accessdate=2007-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While biodegradable,&lt;ref name=&quot;AliceDisposal&quot; /&gt; latex condoms damage the environment when disposed of improperly. According to the Ocean Conservancy, condoms, along with certain other types of trash, cover the [[coral reef]]s and smother [[sea grass]] and other bottom dwellers. The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] also has expressed concerns that many animals might mistake the litter for food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hightower |first1=Eve |last2=Hall |first2=Phoebe |title=Clean sex, wasteful computers and dangerous mascara - Ask E | journal = E - the environmental magazine |date=March–April 2003 |url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1594/is_2_14/ai_98469962 |accessdate=2007-10-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health problems===
Condoms may increase the risk of [[pregnancy complications]] such as [[pre-eclampsia]] and [[miscarriage]] by interfering with the process of [[paternal tolerance]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NewScientist&quot;/&gt;

== Cultural barriers to condom use ==

In much of the [[Western world]], the introduction of [[combined oral contraceptive pill|the pill]] in the 1960s was associated with a decline in condom use.&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|267-9,272-5}} In [[Japan]], oral contraceptives were not approved for use until September 1999, and even then access was more restricted than in other industrialized nations.&lt;!--
  --&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cbs&quot;&gt;{{cite news |author=Hayashi, Aiko |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/08/20/health/main637523.shtml |title=Japanese Women Shun The Pill |publisher=CBS News |date=2004-08-20 |accessdate=2006-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps because of this restricted access to hormonal contraception, Japan has the highest rate of condom usage in the world: in 2008, 80% of contraceptive users relied on condoms.&lt;ref name=&quot;factsheet&quot;/&gt;

Cultural attitudes toward [[gender roles]], [[contraception]], and [[sexual activity]] vary greatly around the world, and range from extremely conservative to extremely liberal. But in places where condoms are misunderstood, mischracterised, demonised, or looked upon with overall cultural disapproval, the prevalence of condom use is directly affected. In less-developed countries and among less-educated populations, misperceptions about how disease transmission and conception work negatively affect the use of condoms; additionally, in cultures with more traditional gender roles, women may feel uncomfortable demanding that their partners use condoms.

As an example, [[latino]] immigrants in the [[United States]] often face cultural barriers to condom use. A study on female HIV prevention published in the ''Journal of Sex Health Research'' asserts that Latino women often lack the attitudes needed to negotiate safe sex due to traditional gender-role norms in the Latino community, and may be afraid to bring up the subject of condom use with their partners. Women who participated in the study often reported that because of the general [[machismo]] subtly encouraged in latino culture, their male partners would be angry or possibly [[domestic violence|violent]] at the woman's suggestion that they use condoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gomez |first=Cynthia A |year=1996 |title=Gender, Culture, and Power: Barriers to HIV-Prevention Strategies for Women |journal=The Journal of Sex Research |volume=33 |issue=4 |pages=355–362 |author2=Marín |doi=10.1080/00224499609551853 |jstor=3813287}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar phenomenon has been noted in a survey of low-income [[African-American|American black]] women; the women in this study also reported a fear of violence at the suggestion to their male partners that condoms be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kalichman |first1=SC |last2=Williams |first2=EA |last3=Cherry |first3=C |last4=Belcher |first4=L |last5=Nachimson |first5=D |date=April 1998 |title=Sexual coercion, domestic violence, and negotiating condom use among low-income African American women |journal=Journal of Women's Health |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=371–378 |url=http://md1.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?requester=gs&amp;collection=ENV&amp;recid=4306315 |doi=10.1089/jwh.1998.7.371}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps even more troubling is the apparent fact of a telephone survey conducted by [[Rand Corporation]] and [[Oregon State University]] and published in the ''[[Journal of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromes]]'' that showed that belief in [[AIDS conspiracy theories]] among United States black men is linked to rates of condom use. As conspiracy beliefs about AIDS grow in a given sector of these black men, consistent condom use drops in that same sector. Female use of condoms, interestingly, was not similarly affected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sexualhealth.e-healthsource.com/?p=news1&amp;id=523594|title=AIDS Conspiracy Theory Belief Linked to Less Condom Use|last=Dotinga|first=Randy|publisher=SexualHealth.com|accessdate=2009-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the African continent, condom promotion in some areas has been impeded by anti-condom campaigns by some Muslim&lt;ref name=&quot;northeast kenya&quot;/&gt; and Catholic clerics.&lt;ref name=&quot;catholicafrica&quot;/&gt; Among the [[Maasai people|Maasai]] in [[Tanzania]], condom use is hampered by an aversion to &quot;wasting&quot; sperm, which is given sociocultural importance beyond reproduction. Sperm is believed to be an &quot;elixir&quot; to women and to have beneficial health effects. Maasai women believe that, after conceiving a child, they must have sexual intercourse repeatedly so that the additional sperm aids the child's development. Frequent condom use is also considered by some Maasai to cause impotence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Coast |first=Ernestina |year=2007 |title=Wasting semen: context and condom use among the Maasai |journal=Culture, health, and sexuality |url=http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/2502/1/Wasting_semen-context_and_condom_use_among_the_Maasai(LSERO).pdf |accessdate=2009-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some women in Africa believe that condoms are &quot;for prostitutes&quot; and that respectable women should not use them.&lt;ref name=&quot;northeast kenya&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plusnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=74336|title=Muslim opposition to condoms limits distribution |date=Sept. 17, 2007|publisher=PlusNews|accessdate=2009-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few clerics even promote the idea that condoms are deliberately laced with HIV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/pius-kamau/islam-condoms-and-aids_b_120418.html |title=Islam, Condoms and AIDS |last=Kamau |first=Pius |date=August 24, 2008 |publisher=The Huffington Post |accessdate=2009-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Major manufacturers ==

One analyst described the size of the condom market as something that &quot;boggles the mind&quot;. Numerous small manufacturers, nonprofit groups, and government-run manufacturing plants exist around the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|322,328}} Within the condom market, there are several major contributors, among them both for-profit businesses and philanthropic organizations. Most large manufacturers have ties to the business that reach back to the end of the 19th century.

* Julius Schmid, Inc. was founded in 1882 and began the Sheik and Ramses brands of condoms.&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|154-6}} The London Rubber Company began manufacturing latex condoms in 1932, under the [[Durex]] brand.&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|199,201,218}} Both companies are now part of [[SSL International|Seton Scholl Limited]].&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|327}}
* Youngs Rubber Company, founded by Merle Youngs in late 19th century America, introduced the [[Trojan (condoms)|Trojan]] line of condoms&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|191}} now owned by [[Church and Dwight]].&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|323-4}}
* [[Dunlop Rubber]] began manufacturing condoms in Australia in the 1890s. In 1905, Dunlop sold its condom-making equipment to one of its employees, Eric Ansell, who founded [[Ansell|Ansell Rubber]]. In 1969, Ansell was sold back to Dunlop.&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|327}} In 1987, English business magnate [[Richard Branson]] contracted with Ansell to help in a campaign against HIV and AIDS. Ansell agreed to manufacture the Mates brand of condom, to be sold at little or no profit in order to encourage condom use. Branson soon sold the Mates brand to Ansell, with royalty payments made annually to the charity [[Virgin Unite]].&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|309,311}}&lt;ref&gt;The Healthcare Foundation, started by [[Virgin Group]], changed names in 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to its Mates brand, Ansell currently manufactures Lifestyles for the U.S. market.&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|333}}
* In 1934 the Kokusia Rubber Company was founded in Japan. It is now known as the Okamoto Rubber Manufacturing Company.&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|257}}
* In 1970 Tim Black and [[Phil Harvey|Philip Harvey]] founded Population Planning Associates (now known as [[Adam &amp; Eve (business)|Adam &amp; Eve]]). Population Planning Associates was a mail-order business that marketed condoms to American college students. Black and Harvey used the profits from their company to start a non-profit organization [[Population Services International]],&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|286-7,337-9}} and Harvey later also founded another nonprofit company, [[DKT International]], that annually sells millions of condoms at discounted rates in developing countries around the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|286-7,337-9}}

A [[spray-on condom]] made of latex is intended to be easier to apply and more successful in preventing the transmission of diseases. As of 2009, the spray-on condom was not going to market because the drying time could not be reduced below two to three minutes.&lt;ref name=&quot;time&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last = Lefevre | first = Callie | title = Spray-On Condoms: Still a Hard Sell | work = TIME Magazine | date = 2008-08-13 | url = http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1832445,00.html | accessdate = 2009-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;spraytv&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sf.tv/var/videoplayer.php?videourl=http%3A%2F%2Freal.xobix.ch%2Framgen%2Fsfdrs%2F10vor10%2F2006%2F10vor10_29112006.rm%3Fstart%3D0%3A23%3A35.732%26amp%3Bend%3D0%3A27%3A02.140 |title=Spray-On-Condom |accessdate=2006-12-03 |publisher=Schweizer Fernsehen News |date=November 29, 2006 |format=streaming video [Real format]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;spray&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spraykondom.de/spraycondom/index.php? |title=Spray-On-Condom |accessdate=2006-12-03 |publisher=Institut für Kondom-Beratung |year=2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Invisible Condom, developed at [[Université Laval]] in Québec, Canada, is a gel that hardens upon increased temperature after insertion into the vagina or rectum. In the lab, it has been shown to effectively block HIV and herpes simplex virus. The barrier breaks down and liquefies after several hours. As of 2005, the invisible condom is in the clinical trial phase, and has not yet been approved for use.&lt;!-- --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Safety, Tolerance and Acceptability Trial of the Invisible Condom in Healthy Women |work=ClinicalTrials.gov |publisher=U.S. National Institutes of Health |month=August | year=2005 |url=http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct/gui/show/NCT00136643?order=6 |accessdate=2006-08-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also developed in 2005 is a condom treated with an erectogenic compound. The drug-treated condom is intended to help the wearer maintain his erection, which should also help reduce slippage. If approved, the condom would be marketed under the Durex brand. As of 2007, it was still in clinical trials.&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|345}} In 2009, Ansell Healthcare, the makers of Lifestyle condoms, introduced the X2 condom lubricated with &quot;Excite Gel&quot; which contains the amino acid l-arginine and is intended to improve the strength of the erectile response.

[[File:Oceania without Asian country codes.jpg|thumb|right|220px|[[Oceania]] without [[Asia]]n country codes]]
'''Country codes''' are short alphabetic or numeric [[geography|geographical]] [[code]]s ([[geocode]]s) developed to represent [[country|countries]] and [[dependent area]]s, for use in [[data processing]] and [[communication]]s. Several different systems have been developed to do this. The best known of these is [[ISO 3166-1]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} The term ''country code'' frequently refers to international dialing codes, the [[E.164]] [[list of country calling codes|country calling codes]].

==ISO 3166-1==
{{main|ISO 3166-1}}

This standard defines for most of the countries and dependent areas in the world:
*a two letter ([[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]])
*a three-letter ([[ISO 3166-1 alpha-3]]), and
*a three-digit numeric ([[ISO 3166-1 numeric]]) code.

The two-letter codes are used as the basis for some other codes or applications, for example,
*for [[ISO 4217]] [[currency]] codes and
*with deviations, for country code [[top-level domain]] names (ccTLDs) on the Internet: [[list of Internet TLDs]].
For more applications see [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]].

==Other country codes==
*The [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) three letter codes used in sporting events: [[list of IOC country codes]]
*The Fédération Internationale de Football Association ([[FIFA]]) assigns a three-letter code (dubbed FIFA Trigramme) to each of its member and non-member countries: [[List of FIFA country codes]]
*The [[North Atlantic Treaty Organisation]] (NATO) used two-letter codes of its own: [[list of NATO country codes]]. They were largely borrowed from the FIPS 10-4 codes mentioned below. In 2003, the eighth edition of the Standardisation Agreement (STANAG) adopted the ISO 3166 three-letter codes with one exception (the code for Macedonia). With the ninth edition, NATO is transitioning to four- and six-letter codes based on ISO 3166 with a few exceptions and additions.
*The coding system for car [[license plate]]s under the 1949 and 1968 United Nations Road Traffic Conventions (distinguishing signs of vehicles in international traffic): [[List of international license plate codes]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unece.org/trans/conventn/Distsigns_Sept2003.pdf UNECE.org]&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[World Meteorological Organization]] (WMO) has its own list of country codes, used in reporting meteorological observations.
*The [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP) also has its own list of [[List of UNDP country codes|trigram country codes]].
*The [[Federal Information Processing Standard]] (FIPS) [[FIPS 10-4|10-4]] defined two letter codes used by the [[United States|US]] government and in the [[CIA World Factbook]]: [[list of FIPS country codes]]. On September 2, 2008, FIPS 10-4 was one of ten standards withdrawn by [[NIST]] as a Federal Information Processing Standard.&lt;ref&gt;Federal Register, September 2, 2008 (Volume 73, Number 170), page 51276&lt;/ref&gt;
*The coding system for [[diplomatic license plates in the United States]], assigned by the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]].
*From the [[International Telecommunication Union]] (ITU):
**the [[E.164]] international telephone dialling codes: [[list of country calling codes]] with 1-3 digits,
**the [[IMSI|E.212]] [[mobile country codes]] (MCC), for mobile/wireless phone addresses,
**the first few characters of call signs of radio stations (maritime, aeronautical, [[amateur radio]], broadcasting, and so on) define the country: the [[ITU prefix]],
**[[ITU letter codes]] for member-countries,
**Three-digit codes used to identify countries in maritime mobile radio transmissions, known as [[maritime identification digits]]
*[[European Union]]:
**Before the [[Enlargement of the European Union|2004 EU enlargement]] the EU used the UN Road Traffic Conventions [[List of international license plate codes|license plate codes]]; since then, it uses [[ISO 3166-1]], with 2 exceptions: ''EL'' (not ''GR'') is used for [[Greece]], and ''UK'' (not ''GB'') is used for the [[United Kingdom]]. [http://publications.europa.eu/code/en/en-370100.htm]

**nationality letters for location indicators.
* From the [[International Union of Railways]] (UIC):
**[[UIC Country Code]]
* [[GOST 7.67]]
* [[ITU prefix - amateur and experimental stations]] - The [[International Telecommunications Union]] (ITU) assigns national telecommuncation prefixes for [[amateur radio|amateur]] and experimantal radio use, so that operators can be identified by their country of origin. These prefixes are legally administered by the national entity to which prefix ranges are assigned.

The developers of ISO 3166 intended that in time it would replace other coding systems in existence.

==Other codings==

'''Cladistics''' ([[Ancient Greek]]: ''{{Polytonic|κλάδος}}'', ''klados'', &quot;branch&quot;) is a method of classifying species of organisms into groups called '''[[clade]]s''', which consist of an ancestor organism and all its descendants (and nothing else). For example, birds, dinosaurs, crocodiles, and all descendants (living or extinct) of their most recent common ancestor form a clade.&lt;ref&gt;[http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/glossary/glossary_popup.php?word=clade Glossary entry &quot;clade&quot;] Understanding Evolution. 2010. University of California Museum of Paleontology.&lt;/ref&gt; In the terms of [[systematics|biological systematics]], a clade is a single &quot;branch&quot; on the &quot;[[Tree of life (science)|tree of life]]&quot;, a [[monophyletic]] group.

Cladistics can be distinguished from other [[taxonomic]] systems, such as [[phenetics]], by its focus on shared derived characters ([[Synapomorphy|synapomorphies]]). Systems developed earlier usually employed overall morphological similarity to group species into genera, families and other higher level groups ([[Taxon|taxa]]); cladistic classifications (usually in the form of trees called [[cladogram]]s) are intended to reflect the relative recency of common ancestry or the sharing of [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] features. Cladistics is also distinguished by an emphasis on [[maximum parsimony|parsimony]] and hypothesis testing (particularly [[falsificationism]]), leading to a claim that cladistics is more objective than systems which rely on subjective judgements of relationship based on similarity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Phillips|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cladistics originated in the work of the German [[entomologist]] [[Willi Hennig]], who referred to it as &quot;phylogenetic systematics&quot; (also the name of his 1966 book); the use of the terms &quot;cladistics&quot; and &quot;clade&quot; was popularized by other researchers. The technique and sometimes the name have been successfully applied in other disciplines: for example, to determine the relationships between the surviving manuscripts of the ''[[Canterbury Tales]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Canterbury Tales Project |url=http://www.canterburytalesproject.org|accessdate=4 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cladists use ''[[cladogram]]s'' — diagrams which show ancestral relations between species — to represent the monophyletic relationships of species, termed [[sister-group]] relationships. This is interpreted as representing phylogeny, or evolutionary relationships. Although traditionally such cladograms were generated largely on the basis of morphological characters, [[genetic sequencing]] data and [[computational phylogenetics]] are now very commonly used in the generation of cladograms.

Cladistics, either generally or in specific applications, has been criticized from its beginnings. A decision as to whether a particular character is a synapomorphy or not may be challenged as involving subjective judgements,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|James|Pourtless IV|2009|p=21ff.}}&lt;/ref&gt; raising the issue of whether cladistics as actually practised is as objective as has been claimed. Formal classifications based on cladistic reasoning are said to emphasize ancestry at the expense of descriptive characteristics, and thus ignore biologically sensible, clearly defined groups which do not fall into clades (e.g. reptiles as traditionally defined or [[prokaryotes]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mayr|1974|p=104}}: &quot;Since birds and crocodilians (excluding all other living reptiles) are derived from a common ancestor, his method [cladistics] forces the cladist to recognize a taxon for birds and crocodilians together, even though this is a useless assemblage.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of cladistics==
The term ''[[clade]]'' was introduced in 1958 by [[Julian Huxley]], ''cladistic'' by Cain and Harrison in 1960, and ''cladist'' (for an adherent of Hennig's school) by Mayr in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dupuis|1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hennig referred to his own approach as ''phylogenetic systematics''. From the time of his original formulation until the end of the 1980s cladistics remained a minority approach to classification. However, in the 1990s it rapidly became the dominant method of classification in evolutionary biology. [[Computer]]s made it possible to process large quantities of data about organisms and their characteristics. At about the same time the development of effective [[polymerase chain reaction]] techniques made it possible to apply cladistic methods of analysis to [[biochemical]] and [[molecular genetics|molecular genetic]] features of organisms as well as to anatomical ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Baron|Høeg|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cladistics as a successor to phenetics===
For some decades in the mid to late twentieth century, a commonly used methodology was [[phenetics]] (&quot;numerical taxonomy&quot;). This can be seen as a predecessor&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mayr|1982|p=221}}&lt;/ref&gt; to some methods of today's cladistics (namely [[Distance matrices in phylogeny|distance matrix]] methods such as [[neighbor-joining]]), but made no attempt to resolve [[phylogeny]], only similarities.

==Clades==
[[File:Phylogenetic-Groups-Rev.svg.png|thumb|400px|right|The yellow group ([[sauropsids]]) is [[Monophyly|monophyletic]], the blue group (traditional [[reptiles]]) is [[Paraphyly|paraphyletic]], and the red group (warm-blooded animals) is [[Polyphyly|polyphyletic]].]]
{{Main|Clade}}

A clade is a group of [[taxon|taxa]] consisting only of an ancestor taxon and all of its descendant taxa. In the diagram provided (a '''cladogram'''), it is hypothesized that all vertebrates, including ray-finned fishes ([[Actinopterygii]]), had a common ancestor, and so form a clade. Within the vertebrates, all tetrapods, including amphibians, mammals, reptiles (as traditionally defined) and birds, are hypothesized to have had a common ancestor, and so also form a clade. The tetrapod ancestor was a descendant of the original vertebrate ancestor, but is not an ancestor of any ray-finned fish living today.

An important caution is that any cladogram is a provisional [[hypothesis]]. Although unlikely, future genetic or morphological evidence might suggest that ray-finned fish and amphibians share a common ancestor that was not an ancestor of the other tetrapods. The new information would cause us to define a ray-finned-fish-and-amphibian clade, altering the cladogram.

The relationship between clades can be described in several ways:
* A clade is ''[[Basal (phylogenetics)|basal]]'' to another clade if it contains that other clade as a subset within it. In the example, the vertebrate clade is basal to the tetrapod and ray-finned fish clades. (Some authors have used &quot;basal&quot; differently to mean a clade that is less species-rich than a sister clade, with such a deficit being taken as an indication of 'primitiveness'. Others consider this usage to be incorrect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Krell|Cranston|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;)
* A clade located within a clade is said to be ''nested'' within that clade. In the diagram, the tetrapod clade is nested within the vertebrate clade.
* Two clades are ''sisters'' if they have an immediate common ancestor. In the diagram, crocodiles and birds are sister clades, as are [[Lissamphibia|modern amphibians]] and amniotes.

===Terminology for characters===
