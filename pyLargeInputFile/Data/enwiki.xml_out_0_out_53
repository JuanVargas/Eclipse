'''Bipolar disorder''' or '''manic-depressive disorder''', also referred to as '''bipolar [[Affect (psychology)|affective]] disorder''' or '''manic depression''', is a [[Classification of mental disorders|psychiatric diagnosis]] that describes a category of [[mood disorders]] defined by the presence of one or more episodes of abnormally elevated energy levels, [[cognition]], and [[Mood (psychology)|mood]] with or without one or more depressive episodes. The elevated moods are clinically referred to as [[mania]] or, if milder, [[hypomania]]. Individuals who experience manic episodes also commonly experience [[major depressive episode|depressive]] episodes, or symptoms, or [[mixed episodes]] in which features of both mania and depression are present at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Basco | first = Monica Ramirez | title = The Bipolar Workbook: Tools for Controlling Your Mood Swings | publisher = The Guilford Press | location = New York | year = 2006 | isbn = 1593851626 |page = viii}}&lt;/ref&gt; These episodes are usually separated by periods of &quot;normal&quot; [[mood (psychology)|mood]]; but, in some individuals, depression and mania may rapidly alternate, which is known as [[rapid cycling]]. Extreme manic episodes can sometimes lead to such [[psychotic]] symptoms as [[delusions]] and [[hallucinations]]. The disorder has been subdivided into [[bipolar I|bipolar&amp;nbsp;I]], [[bipolar II|bipolar&amp;nbsp;II]], [[cyclothymia]], and other types, based on the nature and severity of mood episodes experienced; the range is often described as the [[bipolar spectrum]].

Data from the United States on [[lifetime prevalence]] varies; but it indicates a rate of around 1% for bipolar I, 0.5%–1% for bipolar II or [[cyclothymia]], and 2%–5% for subthreshold cases meeting some, but not all, criteria.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} The onset of full [[symptom]]s generally occurs in late adolescence or young adulthood. Diagnosis is based on the person's self-reported experiences, as well as observed behavior. Episodes of abnormality are associated with distress and disruption and an elevated risk of [[suicide]], especially during depressive episodes. In some cases, it can be a devastating long-lasting disorder. In others, it has also been associated with creativity, goal striving, and positive achievements. There is significant evidence to suggest that [[list of people affected by bipolar disorder|many people]] with creative talents have also suffered from some form of bipolar disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite doi|10.1016/S0165-0327(02)00462-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is often suggested that [[creativity and bipolar disorder]] is linked.

[[Genetics|Genetic factors]] contribute substantially to the likelihood of developing bipolar disorder, and environmental factors are also implicated. Bipolar disorder is often treated with [[mood stabilizing medication]]s and, sometimes, other psychiatric drugs. [[Psychotherapy]] also has a role, often when there has been some recovery of the subject's stability. In serious cases, in which there is a risk of harm to oneself or others, [[involuntary commitment]] may be used. These cases generally involve severe manic episodes with dangerous behavior or depressive episodes with [[suicidal ideation]]. There are widespread problems with [[social stigma]], [[stereotypes]], and [[prejudice]] against individuals with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stigma and Bipolar Disorder&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bipolar.about.com/od/stigma/Stigma.htm|publisher=NIMH|title=Stigma and Bipolar Disorder|date=February 21, 2009|accessdate=2010-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; People with bipolar disorder exhibiting psychotic symptoms can sometimes be misdiagnosed as having [[schizophrenia]], another serious mental illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/bipolar-disorder/what-are-the-symptoms-of-bipolar-disorder.shtml|publisher=NIMH|title=What are the symptoms of bipolar disorder?|date=April 15, 2009|accessdate=2010-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current term &quot;bipolar disorder&quot; is of fairly recent origin and refers to the cycling between high and low episodes (poles). A relationship between mania and [[melancholia]] had long been observed, although the basis of the current conceptualisation can be traced back to French psychiatrists in the 1850s. The term &quot;manic-depressive illness&quot; or psychosis was coined by German psychiatrist [[Emil Kraepelin]] in the late nineteenth century, originally referring to all kinds of mood disorder. German psychiatrist [[Karl Leonhard]] split the classification again in 1957, employing the terms [[unipolar disorder]] ([[major depressive disorder]]) and bipolar disorder.

==Signs and symptoms==
Bipolar disorder is a condition in which people experience abnormally elevated (manic or hypomanic) and, in many cases, abnormally depressed states for periods of time in a way that interferes with functioning. Not everyone's symptoms are the same, and there is no simple physiological test to confirm the disorder. Bipolar disorder can appear to be [[unipolar depression]].  Diagnosing bipolar disorder is often difficult, even for mental health professionals.  What distinguishes bipolar disorder from unipolar depression is that the affected person experiences states of mania and depression. Often bipolar is inconsistent among patients because some people feel depressed more often than not and experience little mania whereas others experience predominantly manic symptoms.  Additionally, the younger the age of onset—bipolar disorder starts in childhood or early adulthood in most patients—the more likely the first few episodes are to be depression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowden&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ps.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/52/1/51|title=Strategies to Reduce Misdiagnosis of Bipolar Depression|last=Bowden|first=Charles L., M.D.|publisher=[[American Psychiatric Association]]|date=January 2001|accessdate=2010-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because a bipolar diagnosis requires a manic or hypomanic episode, many patients are initially diagnosed and treated as having major depression.

===Depressive episode===
{{Main|Major depressive episode}}
Signs and symptoms of the depressive phase of bipolar disorder include persistent feelings of [[sadness]], [[anxiety]], [[guilt]], [[anger]], [[isolation]], or [[hopelessness]]; disturbances in sleep and appetite; fatigue  and loss of interest in usually enjoyable activities; problems concentrating; loneliness, self-loathing, apathy or indifference; [[depersonalization]]; loss of interest in sexual activity; shyness or [[social anxiety]]; irritability, chronic pain (with or without a known cause); lack of motivation; and morbid suicidal ideation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mayo-dsection2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/bipolar-disorder/DS00356/DSECTION=2 |title=Bipolar Disorder: Signs and symptoms |publisher=Mayo Clinic |accessdate= |work= }}{{dead link|date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In severe cases, the individual may become [[psychotic]], a condition also known as severe bipolar depression with psychotic features. These symptoms include [[delusion]]s or, less commonly, [[hallucination]]s, usually unpleasant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb |American Psychiatric Association|2000a| p=412}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A major depressive episode persists for at least two weeks, and may continue for over six months if left untreated.&lt;ref name=APA349&gt;{{Harvnb |American Psychiatric Association|2000a| p=349}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manic episode===
{{Main|Mania}}
Mania is the signature characteristic of bipolar disorder and, depending on its severity, is how the disorder is classified. Mania is generally characterized by a distinct period of an elevated mood, which can take the form of euphoria. People commonly experience an increase in energy and a decreased need for sleep, with many often getting as little as 3 or 4 hours of sleep per night, while others can go days without sleeping.&lt;ref&gt;American Psychiatric Association (1994). Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (4th edition). Washington, DC. pp357.&lt;/ref&gt; A person may exhibit [[pressured speech]], with [[racing thoughts|thoughts experienced as racing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bipolar.about.com/od/maniahypomani1/a/mania.htm |title=Warning Signs of Mania |last=Read |first=Kimberly |publisher=About.com |date=2010-02-27 |accessdate=2010-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attention span is low, and a person in a manic state may be easily distracted. Judgment may become impaired, and sufferers may go on spending sprees or engage in behavior that is quite abnormal for them. They may indulge in substance abuse, particularly alcohol or other depressants, cocaine or other stimulants, or sleeping pills. Their behavior may become aggressive, intolerant, or intrusive. People may feel out of control or unstoppable, or as if they have been &quot;chosen&quot; and are &quot;on a special mission&quot; or have other grandiose or delusional ideas. Sexual drive may increase. At more extreme phases of bipolar I, a person in a manic state can begin to experience [[psychosis]], or a break with reality, where thinking is affected along with mood.&lt;ref name=&quot;NIHpublication08-3679&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/bipolar-disorder/complete-publication.shtml |title=NIMH · Bipolar Disorder: NIH Publication 08-3679, Revised 2008 |publisher=Nimh.nih.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some people in a manic state experience severe [[anxiety]] and are very irritable (to the point of rage), while others are [[euphoria (emotion)|euphoric]] and grandiose.

To be diagnosed with mania according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), a person must experience this state of elevated or irritable mood, as well as other symptoms, for at least one week, less if hospitalization is required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Severity of manic symptoms can be measured by rating scales such as self-reported  [[Altman Self-Rating Mania Scale]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 9359982 | doi=10.1016/S0006-3223(96)00548-3 | volume=42 | issue=10 | title=The Altman Self-Rating Mania Scale | year=1997 | month=November | pages=948–55 | author=Altman EG, Hedeker D, Peterson JL, Davis JM}}&lt;/ref&gt; and clinician-based  [[Young Mania Rating Scale]].&lt;ref name=&quot;YMRS_paper&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Young RC, Biggs JT, Ziegler VE, Meyer DA |title=A rating scale for mania: reliability, validity and sensitivity |journal=Br J Psychiatry |volume=133 |pages=429–35 |year=1978 |month=Nov |pmid=728692 |url=http://bjp.rcpsych.org/cgi/content/abstract/133/5/429 |doi=10.1192/bjp.133.5.429}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hypomanic episode===
{{Main|Hypomanic episode}}
Hypomania is generally a mild to moderate level of mania, characterized by optimism, pressure of speech and activity, and decreased need for sleep. Generally, hypomania does not inhibit functioning like mania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/bipolar-disorder/guide/hypomania-mania-symptoms|title=Hypomania and Mania Symptoms in Bipolar Disorder|publisher=WebMD.com|date=January 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many people with hypomania are actually in fact more productive than usual, while manic individuals have difficulty completing tasks due to a shortened attention span. Some people have increased creativity while others demonstrate poor judgment and irritability. Many people experience signature [[hypersexuality]]. These persons generally have increased energy and tend to become more active than usual. They do not, however, have [[delusions]] or hallucinations. Hypomania can be difficult to diagnose because it may masquerade as mere happiness, though it carries the same risks as mania.

Hypomania may feel good to the person who experiences it. Thus, even when family and friends learn to recognize the mood swings, the individual often will deny that anything is wrong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pueblo.gsa.gov/cic_text/health/bipolar/bipolar.htm |title=Bipolar Disorder: NIH Publication No. 95-3679|publisher=U.S. National Institutes of Health|date=September 1995 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080429204140/http://www.pueblo.gsa.gov/cic_text/health/bipolar/bipolar.htm |archivedate = 2008-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, the individual may not be able to recall the events that took place while they were experiencing hypomania.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowden&quot;/&gt; What might be called a &quot;hypomanic event&quot;, if not accompanied by complementary depressive episodes (&quot;downs&quot;, etc.), is not typically deemed as problematic: The &quot;problem&quot; arises when mood changes are uncontrollable and, more importantly, volatile or &quot;mercurial&quot;. If unaccompanied by depressive counterpart episodes or otherwise general [[irritability]], this behavior is typically called [[hyperthymia]], or [[happiness]], which is, of course, perfectly normal. Indeed, the most elementary definition of bipolar disorder is an often &quot;violent&quot; or &quot;jarring&quot; state of essentially uncontrollable [[oscillation]] between [[hyperthymia]] and [[dysthymia]].  If left untreated, an episode of hypomania can last anywhere from a few days to several years. Most commonly, symptoms continue for a few weeks to a few months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/bipolar-disorder/guide/bipolar-2-disorder|title=Bipolar II Disorder Symptoms and Signs|publisher=[[Web M.D.]]|accessdate=2010-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mixed affective episode===
{{Main|Mixed state (psychiatry)}}
In the context of bipolar disorder, a mixed state is a condition during which symptoms of [[mania]] and [[clinical depression]] occur simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/bipolar-disorder/DS00356/DSECTION=7 |title=Bipolar Disorder: Complications |accessdate= |publisher=Mayo Clinic}}{{dead link|date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Typical examples include tearfulness during a manic episode or racing thoughts during a depressive episode. Individuals may also feel incredibly frustrated in this state, since one may feel like a failure and at the same time have a [[flight of ideas]]. Mixed states are often the most dangerous period of mood disorders, during which [[substance abuse]], [[panic disorder]], [[suicide]] attempts, and other complications increase greatly.&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, E. (1999). Severe Anxiety, Agitation are Warning Signals of Suicide in Bipolar Patients. ''Clin Psychiatr News''. pg 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Associated features===
{{Main|Associated features of bipolar disorder}}
Associated features are clinical phenomena that often accompany the disorder but are not part of the diagnostic criteria for the disorder. There are several childhood precursors in children who later receive a diagnosis of bipolar disorder. They may show subtle early traits such as mood abnormalities, full major depressive episodes, and [[ADHD]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid2504732&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Andreoli TE |title=Molecular aspects of endocrinology |journal=Hosp. Pract. (Off. Ed.) |volume=24 |issue=8 |pages=11–2 |year=1989 |month=August |pmid=2504732 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; BD is also accompanied by changes in [[Cognition|cognitive]] processes and abilities. This include reduced [[attention]]al and [[Executive functions|executive]] capabilities and impaired [[memory]]. How the individual processes the world also depends on the phase of the disorder, with differential characteristics between the manic, hypomanic and depressive states.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mansell2008&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 17825463 | doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2007.07.010 | volume=28 | issue=3 | journal = Clinical Psychology Review | year=2008 | title = The ascent into mania: A review of psychological processes associated with the development of manic symptoms | month=March | pages=494–520 | author=Mansell W, Pedley R | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some studies have found a significant association between bipolar disorder and [[creativity]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid20936438&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Srivastava S, Ketter TA |title=The link between bipolar disorders and creativity: evidence from personality and temperament studies |journal=Curr Psychiatry Rep |volume=12 |issue=6 |pages=522–30 |year=2010 |month=December |pmid=20936438 |doi=10.1007/s11920-010-0159-x |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
The causes of bipolar disorder likely vary between individuals. [[Twin studies]] have been limited by relatively small sample sizes but have indicated a substantial genetic contribution, as well as environmental influence. For bipolar I, the (probandwise) [[concordance (genetics)|concordance]] rates in modern studies have been consistently put at around 40% in [[monozygotic]] twins (same genes), compared to 0 to 10% in [[dizygotic]] twins.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kieseppa_2004&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Kieseppä T, Partonen T, Haukka J, Kaprio J, Lönnqvist J |title=High concordance of bipolar I disorder in a nationwide sample of twins |journal=Am J Psychiatry |volume=161 |issue=10 |pages=1814–21 |year=2004 |month=October |pmid=15465978 |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.161.10.1814 |url=|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; A combination of bipolar I, II and [[cyclothymia]] produced concordance rates of 42% vs 11%, with a relatively lower ratio for bipolar II that likely reflects heterogeneity. The overall [[heritability]] of the [[bipolar spectrum]] has been put at 0.71.&lt;ref name=&quot;Edvardsen2008&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 17692389 | doi=10.1016/j.jad.2007.07.001 | volume=106 | issue=3 | journal = Journal of Affective Disorders | year=2008 | title = Heritability of bipolar spectrum disorders. Unity or heterogeneity | month=March | pages=229–40 | author=Edvardsen J, Torgersen S, Røysamb E, ''et al.'' | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is overlap with [[unipolar depression]] and if this is also counted in the co-twin the concordance with bipolar disorder rises to 67% in monozigotic twins and 19% in dizigotic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last = McGuffin | first = P | last2 = Rijsdijk | first2 = F | last3 = Andrew | first3 = M | last4 = Sham | first4 = P | last5 = Katz | first5 = R | last6 = Cardno | first6 = A | title = The Heritability of Bipolar Affective Disorder and the Genetic Relationship to Unipolar Depression | journal = Archives of General Psychiatry | volume = 60 | issue = 5 | pages = 497–502 | year = 2003 | url = http://archpsyc.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/60/5/497 | doi = 10.1001/archpsyc.60.5.497 | pmid = 12742871| ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The relatively low concordance between dizygotic twins brought up together suggests that shared family environmental effects are limited, although the ability to detect them has been limited by small sample sizes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Edvardsen2008&quot; /&gt;

===Genetic===
Genetic studies have suggested many [[chromosomal]] regions and [[candidate gene]]s appearing to relate to the development of bipolar disorder, but the results are not consistent and often not replicated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 17239033 | doi=10.1111/j.1440-1819.2007.01604.x | volume=61 | issue=1 | journal = Psychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences | year=2007 | title = Molecular genetics of bipolar disorder and depression | month=February | pages=3–19 | author=Kato T | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Although the first [[genetic linkage]] finding for mania was in 1969,&lt;ref&gt;Reich, T., P. J. Clayton and G. Winokur (1969). &quot;Family history studies-V  The genetics of Mania.&quot; American Journal of Psychiatry l25: l358–1369.&lt;/ref&gt; the linkage studies have been inconsistent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Burmeister2008&quot; /&gt; Meta-analyses of linkage studies detected either no significant genome-wide findings or, using a different methodology, only two genome-wide significant peaks, on chromosome 6q and on 8q21.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} Genome-wide [[genetic association|association]] studies neither brought a consistent focus&amp;nbsp;— each has identified new loci.&lt;ref name=&quot;Burmeister2008&quot;&gt;Margit Burmeister, Melvin G. McInnis, &amp; Sebastian Zöllner [http://www.nature.com/nrg/journal/v9/n7/abs/nrg2381.html Psychiatric genetics: progress amid controversy] Nature Reviews Genetics 9, 527–540 (July 2008) | doi:10.1038/nrg2381&lt;/ref&gt;

Findings point strongly to heterogeneity, with different genes being implicated in different families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Segurado R, Detera-Wadleigh SD, Levinson DF, Lewis CM, Gill M, Nurnberger JI Jr, Craddock N ''et al.'' | year = 2003 | title = Genome Scan Meta-Analysis of Schizophrenia and Bipolar Disorder, Part III: Bipolar Disorder | url = | journal = Am J Hum Genet | volume = 73 | issue = 1| pages = 49–62 | pmid = 12802785 | pmc = 1180589 | doi=10.1086/376547 | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; A review seeking to identify the more consistent findings suggested several genes related to [[serotonin]] (SLC6A4 and TPH2), [[dopamine]] (DRD4 and SLC6A3), [[glutamate]] (DAOA and DTNBP1), and cell growth and/or maintenance pathways (NRG1, DISC1 and [[BDNF]]), although noting a high risk of false positives in the published literature. It was also suggested that individual genes are likely to have only a small effect and to be involved in some aspect related to the disorder (and a broad range of &quot;normal&quot; human behavior) rather than the disorder per se.&lt;ref name=&quot;Serretti&quot; /&gt;

[[Paternal age effect|Advanced paternal age]] has been linked to a somewhat increased chance of bipolar disorder in offspring, consistent with a hypothesis of increased new [[genetic mutations]].&lt;ref&gt;Frans, E., Sandin, S., Reichenberg, A., Lichtenstein, P., Langstrom, N., Hultman, C. (2008) [http://archpsyc.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/short/65/9/1034 Advancing Paternal Age and Bipolar Disorder] Arch Gen Psychiatry. 2008;65(9):1034–1040.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Physiological===
Abnormalities in the structure and/or function of certain brain circuits could underlie bipolar. Two meta-analyses of MRI studies in bipolar disorder report a increase in the volume of the [[lateral ventricles]], [[globus pallidus]] and increase in the rates of deep white matter [[hyperintensities]].&lt;ref&gt;Kempton, M.J., Geddes, J.R, Ettinger, U. et al.

The &quot;kindling&quot; theory asserts that people who are genetically predisposed toward bipolar disorder can experience a series of stressful events,&lt;ref name=&quot;kindling&quot;&gt;[http://www.bpinfo.net/kindling_theory.htm Link and reference involving kindling theory]&lt;/ref&gt; each of which lowers the threshold at which mood changes occur. Eventually, a mood episode can start (and become recurrent) by itself. There is evidence of [[hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis]] (HPA axis) abnormalities in bipolar disorder due to [[stress (biological)|stress]].&lt;ref&gt;Brian Koehler, Ph.D., The International Society for the Psychological Treatment Of Schizophrenia and Other Psychoses, [http://www.isps-us.org/koehler/bipolar_stress.htm Bipolar Disorder, Stress, and the HPA Axis], 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other brain components which have been proposed to play a role are the [[mitochondria]],&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16027739&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Stork C, Renshaw PF |title=Mitochondrial dysfunction in bipolar disorder: evidence from magnetic resonance spectroscopy research |journal=Mol.

===Environmental===
Evidence suggests that environmental factors play a significant role in the development and course of bipolar disorder, and that individual psychosocial variables may interact with genetic dispositions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Serretti&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 18332878 | doi=10.1038/mp.2008.29 | volume=13 | issue=8 | journal = Molecular Psychiatry | year=2008 | title = The genetics of bipolar disorder: genome ‘hot regions,’ genes, new potential candidates and future directions | month=August | pages=742–71 | author=Serretti A, Mandelli L | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is fairly consistent evidence from prospective studies that recent life events and interpersonal relationships contribute to the likelihood of onsets and recurrences of bipolar mood episodes, as they do for onsets and recurrences of unipolar depression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alloy2005&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 16140445 | doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2005.06.006 | volume=25 | issue=8 | journal = Clinical Psychology Review | year=2005 | title = The psychosocial context of bipolar disorder: Environmental, cognitive, and developmental risk factors | month=December | pages=1043–75 | author=Alloy LB, Abramson LY, Urosevic S, Walshaw PD, Nusslock R, Neeren AM | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been repeated findings that between a third and a half of adults diagnosed with bipolar disorder report traumatic/abusive experiences in childhood, which is associated on average with earlier onset, a worse course, and more co-occurring disorders such as [[PTSD]].&lt;ref&gt;Gabriele S Leverich a, Robert M Post [http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(06)68450-X/fulltext Course of bipolar illness after history of childhood trauma] The Lancet, Volume 367, Issue 9516, Pages 1040–1042, April 1, 2006 doi:10.1016/S0140-6736(06)68450-XCite&lt;/ref&gt; The total number of reported stressful events in childhood is higher in those with an adult diagnosis of bipolar spectrum disorder compared to those without, particularly events stemming from a harsh environment rather than from the child's own behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Louisa D.

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis is based on the self-reported experiences of an individual as well as abnormalities in behavior reported by family members, friends or co-workers, followed by secondary signs observed by a [[psychiatrist]], [[nurse]], [[social worker]], [[clinical psychologist]] or other clinician in a clinical assessment.  There are lists of criteria for someone to be so diagnosed. These depend on both the presence and duration of certain signs and symptoms. Assessment is usually done on an outpatient basis; admission to an inpatient facility is considered if there is a risk to oneself or others. The most widely used criteria for diagnosing bipolar disorder are from the American Psychiatric Association's [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]], the current version being DSM-IV-TR, and the [[World Health Organization|World Health Organization's]] [[ICD|International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems]], currently the ICD-10. The latter criteria are typically used in Europe and other regions while the DSM criteria are used in the USA and other regions, as well as prevailing in research studies.

An initial assessment may include a physical exam by a physician. Although there are no biological tests which confirm bipolar disorder, tests may be carried out to exclude medical illnesses such as [[hypothyroidism|hypo-]] or [[hyperthyroidism]], metabolic disturbance, a systemic infection or chronic disease, and [[syphilis]] or [[HIV]] infection. An [[Electroencephalography|EEG]] may be used to exclude [[epilepsy]], and a [[Computed tomography|CT scan]] of the head to exclude brain lesions. Investigations are not generally repeated for relapse unless there is a specific ''medical'' indication.

Several [[rating scale]]s for the [[Screening (medicine)|screening]] and evaluation of BD exist, such as the [[Bipolar spectrum diagnostic scale]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid19122534&quot;/&gt; The use of evaluation scales can not substitute a full clinical interview but they serve to systematize the recollection of symptoms.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid19122534&quot;/&gt;  On the other hand instruments for the screening of BD have low [[sensitivity]] and limited diagnostic [[Validity (statistics)|validity]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid19122534&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Picardi A |title=Rating scales in bipolar disorder |journal=Curr Opin Psychiatry |volume=22 |issue=1 |pages=42–9 |year=2009 |month=January |pmid=19122534 |doi=10.1097/YCO.0b013e328315a4d2 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criteria and subtypes===
There is no clear consensus as to how many types of bipolar disorder exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Akiskal HS, Benazzi F | year = 2006 | month = May | title = The DSM-IV and ICD-10 categories of recurrent [major] depressive and bipolar II disorders: evidence that they lie on a dimensional spectrum | journal = J Affect Disord. | volume = 92 | issue = 1 | pages = 45–54 | pmid = 16488021 | doi = 10.1016/j.jad.2005.12.035|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[DSM-IV-TR]] and [[ICD-10]], bipolar disorder is conceptualized as a [[Bipolar spectrum|spectrum of disorders]] occurring on a continuum. The DSM-IV-TR lists three specific subtypes and one for non-specified:&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite book |title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders |edition=4th, text revision ([[DSM-IV-TR]]) |author=American Psychiatric Association |year=2000 |isbn=0-89042-025-4 |ref=DSM-IV-TR |publisher=&lt;!-- pacify Citation bot --&gt; |location=&lt;!-- pacify Citation bot --&gt; }} {{vcite book |chapter=Bipolar Disorder |chapterurl=http://www.behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/bipdis.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

; [[Bipolar I disorder]]: One or more [[manic episodes]]. Subcategories specify whether there has been more than one episode, and the type of the most recent episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite book |title=DSM-IV-TR |chapter=Bipolar I Disorder |chapterurl=http://www.behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/bip1dis.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; A depressive or hypomanic episode is not required for diagnosis, but it frequently occurs.
; [[Bipolar II disorder]]: No manic episodes, but one or more [[hypomanic]] episodes and one or more [[major depressive episode]].&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite book |title=DSM-IV-TR |chapter=Diagnostic criteria for 296.89 Bipolar II Disorder |chapterurl=http://www.behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/bip2dis.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a bipolar II diagnosis is not a guarantee that they will not eventually suffer from such an episode in the future.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Hypomanic episodes do not go to the full extremes of mania (''i.e.'', do not usually cause severe social or occupational impairment, and are without [[psychosis]]), and this can make bipolar II more difficult to diagnose, since the hypomanic episodes may simply appear as a period of successful high productivity and is reported less frequently than a distressing, crippling depression.
; [[Cyclothymia]]: A history of hypomanic episodes with periods of [[Clinical depression|depression]] that do not meet criteria for [[major depressive episode]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite book |title=DSM-IV-TR |chapter=Diagnostic criteria for 301.13 Cyclothimic Disorder |chapterurl=http://www.behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/cclthymcdis.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a low-grade cycling of mood which appears to the observer as a personality trait, and interferes with functioning.
; [[Bipolar NOS|Bipolar Disorder NOS]] (Not Otherwise Specified): This is a catchall category, diagnosed when the disorder does not fall within a specific subtype.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite book |title=DSM-IV-TR |chapter=Not Otherwise Specified (NOS) |chapterurl=http://www.behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/nos.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bipolar NOS]] can still significantly impair and adversely affect the quality of life of the patient.

The bipolar I and II categories have specifiers that indicate the presentation and course of the disorder. For example, the &quot;with full interepisode recovery&quot; specifier applies if there was full remission between the two most recent episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite book |title=DSM-IV-TR |chapter=Longitudinal course specifiers for mood disorders |chapterurl=http://www.behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/clcs.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rapid cycling====
Most people who meet criteria for bipolar disorder experience a number of episodes, on average 0.4 to 0.7 per year, lasting three to six months.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Angst | first = J | last2 = Selloro | first2 = R | title = Historical perspectives and natural history of bipolar disorder | journal = Biological Psychiatry | volume = 48 | issue = 6 | pages = 445–457 | date = September 15, 2000 | doi = 10.1016/S0006-3223(00)00909-4 | pmid = 11018218| ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Rapid cycling'', however, is a course specifier that may be applied to any of the above subtypes. It is defined as having four or more episodes per year and is found in a significant fraction of individuals with bipolar disorder. The definition of rapid cycling most frequently cited in the literature (including the DSM) is that of Dunner and Fieve: at least four major depressive, manic, hypomanic or mixed episodes are required to have occurred during a 12-month period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Mackin | first = P | last2 = Young | first2 = AH | title = Rapid cycling bipolar disorder: historical overview and focus on emerging treatments | journal = Bipolar Disorders | volume = 6 | issue =   6| pages = 523–529 | year = 2004 | doi = 10.1111/j.1399-5618.2004.00156.x | pmid = 15541068| ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultra-rapid (days) or ultra-ultra rapid or [[ultradian]] (within a day) cycling have also been described.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid14642014&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Tillman R, Geller B |title=Definitions of rapid, ultrarapid, and ultradian cycling and of episode duration in pediatric and adult bipolar disorders: a proposal to distinguish episodes from cycles |journal=J Child Adolesc Psychopharmacol |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=267–71 |year=2003 |pmid=14642014 |doi=10.1089/104454603322572598 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Differential diagnosis===
There are several other mental disorders which may involve similar symptoms to bipolar disorder. These include [[schizophrenia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Pope HG |year=1983 |title=Distinguishing bipolar disorder from schizophrenia in clinical practice: guidelines and case reports |journal=Hospital and Community Psychiatry |volume=34|pages=322–28|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[schizoaffective disorder]], drug intoxication, brief drug-induced psychosis, [[schizophreniform disorder]] and [[borderline personality disorder]]. Both borderline personality and bipolar disorder can involve what are referred to as &quot;mood swings&quot;. In bipolar disorder, the term refers to the cyclic episodes of elevated and depressed mood which generally last weeks or months. The term in borderline personality refers to the marked [[Affective lability|lability]] and reactivity of mood, known as [[emotional dysregulation]], due to response to external psychosocial and intrapsychic stressors; these may arise or subside suddenly and dramatically and last for seconds, minutes, hours or days. A bipolar depression is generally more pervasive with sleep, appetite disturbance and nonreactive mood, whereas the mood in dysthymia of borderline personality remains markedly reactive and sleep disturbance not acute.&lt;ref&gt;Goodwin &amp; Jamison. pp. 108–110.&lt;/ref&gt; Some hold that borderline personality disorder represents a subthreshold form of mood disorder while others maintain the distinctness, though noting they often coexist.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15453104&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Magill CA |title=The boundary between borderline personality disorder and bipolar disorder: current concepts and challenges |journal=Can J Psychiatry |volume=49 |issue=8 |pages=551–6 |year=2004 |month=August |pmid=15453104 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Challenges===
The experiences and behaviors involved in bipolar disorder are often not understood by individuals or recognized by mental health professionals, so diagnosis may sometimes be delayed for over 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.familyaware.org/expertprofiles/drghaemi4.asp|title=Bipolar Disorder: How long does it usually take for someone to be diagnosed for bipolar disorder?|author=S. Nassir Ghaemi|year=2001|accessdate = February 20, 2007| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061207224847/http://www.familyaware.org/expertprofiles/drghaemi4.asp| archivedate = December 7, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The treatment lag is apparently not decreasing, even though there is increased public awareness of the condition. 

Individuals are commonly misdiagnosed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Misdiagnosis of Bipolar Disorder|author=Roy H. Perlis|journal=American Journal of Managed Care|url=http://www.ajmc.com/Article.cfm?Menu=1&amp;ID=2969|year=2005|accessdate = February 20, 2007|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; An individual may appear simply depressed when they are seen by a health professional. This can result in misdiagnosis of [[Major Depressive Disorder]]. However, there is also a long-standing issue in the research literature as to whether a categorical classificatory divide between unipolar and bipolar depression is actually valid, or whether it is more accurate to talk of a continuum involving dimensions of depression and mania.&lt;ref&gt;Amy K. Cuellar, Sheri L. Johnson and Ray Winters (2005) Distinctions between bipolar and unipolar depression ''Clinical Psychology Review'', Vol 25, 3, May, P 307-339 {{PMID|15792852}} {{doi|10.1016/j.cpr.2004.12.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benazzi F. (2007) Is there a continuity between bipolar and depressive disorders? ''Psychother Psychosom'' 76(2):70-6. {{PMID|17230047}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been noted that the bipolar disorder diagnosis is officially characterised in historical terms such that, technically, anyone with a history of (hypo)mania and depression has bipolar disorder whatever their current or future functioning and vulnerability. This has been described as &quot;an ethical and methodological issue&quot;, as it means no one can be considered as being recovered (only &quot;in [[remission (medicine)|remission]]&quot;) from bipolar disorder according to the official criteria. This is considered especially problematic given that brief hypomanic episodes are widespread among people generally and not necessarily associated with dysfunction.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mansell2008&quot; /&gt;

Flux is the fundamental nature of bipolar disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dbsalliance.org/site/PageServer?pagename=about_MDOverview |title=Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance: About Mood Disorders |publisher=Dbsalliance.org |date= |accessdate=2011-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals with the illness have continual changes in energy, [[mood (psychology)|mood]], thought, sleep, and activity. The [[medical diagnosis|diagnostic]] subtypes of bipolar disorder are thus static descriptions—snapshots, perhaps—of an illness in continual flux, with a great diversity of symptoms and varying degrees of severity. Individuals may stay in one subtype, or change into another, over the course of their illness.&lt;ref&gt;Goodwin &amp; Jamison, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[DSM-V]], to be published in 2013, will likely include further and more accurate sub-typing (Akiskal and Ghaemi, 2006).

The diagnosis of bipolar disorder can be complicated by coexisting psychiatric conditions such as [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]], [[social anxiety disorder|social phobia]], [[panic disorder]], or [[attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder]]. [[Substance abuse]] may predate the appearance of bipolar symptoms, further complicating the diagnosis. A careful longitudinal analysis of symptoms and episodes, enriched if possible by discussions with friends and family members, is crucial to establishing a treatment plan where these comorbidities exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Sagman D and Tohen M |title=Comorbidity in Bipolar Disorder: The Complexity of Diagnosis and Treatment |journal=Psychiatric Times |volume= |issue= |year=2009 |url=http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/display/article/10168/1391541|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management==
{{Main|Treatment of bipolar disorder}}
There are a number of [[pharmacological]] and [[psychotherapeutic]] techniques used to treat bipolar disorder. Individuals may use [[self-help groups for mental health|self-help]] and pursue [[recovery model|recovery]].

Hospitalization may be required especially with the manic episodes present in bipolar I. This can be voluntary or (if mental health legislation allows and varying state-to-state regulations in the USA) involuntary (called civil or [[involuntary commitment]]). Long-term inpatient stays are now less common due to [[deinstitutionalization]], although these can still occur.&lt;ref name=&quot;BeckerKilian2006&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Becker T, Kilian R | year = 2006 | title = Psychiatric services for people with severe mental illness across western Europe: what can be generalized from current knowledge about differences in provision, costs and outcomes of mental health care? | url = | journal = [[Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica]] Supplement | volume = 429 | issue =  429| pages = 9–16 | pmid = 16445476 | doi=10.1111/j.1600-0447.2005.00711.x | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following (or in lieu of) a hospital admission, support services available can include drop-in centers, visits from members of a community mental health team or [[Assertive Community Treatment]] team, supported employment and patient-led support groups, intensive outpatient programs.  These are sometimes referred to partial-inpatient programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 17329468 | doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.164.3.437 | volume=164 | issue=3 | journal = American Journal of Psychiatry | year=2007 | title = Cognitive Training for Supported Employment: 2-3 Year Outcomes of a Randomized Controlled Trial | month=March | pages=437–41 | author=McGurk SR, Mueser KT, Feldman K, Wolfe R, Pascaris A | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychosocial===
[[Psychotherapy]] is aimed at alleviating core symptoms, recognizing episode triggers, reducing negative expressed emotion in relationships, recognizing [[prodromal]] symptoms before full-blown recurrence, and, practicing the factors that lead to maintenance of [[remission (medicine)|remission]]&lt;ref&gt;Lam et al., 1999; Johnson &amp; Leahy, 2004; Basco &amp; Rush, 2005; Miklowitz &amp; Goldstein, 1997; Frank, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cognitive behavioural therapy]], [[family therapy|family-focused therapy]], and [[psychoeducation]] have the most evidence for efficacy in regard to relapse prevention, while [[interpersonal and social rhythm therapy]] and cognitive-behavioural therapy appear the most effective in regard to residual depressive symptoms. Most studies have been based only on bipolar I, however, and treatment during the acute phase can be a particular challenge.&lt;ref&gt;Zaretsky AE, Rizvi S, &amp; Parikh SV. (2007). [http://publications.cpa-apc.org/media.php?mid=343 How well do psychosocial interventions work in bipolar disorder?] Can J Psychiatry, January;52(1):14–21.&lt;/ref&gt; Some clinicians emphasize the need to talk with individuals experiencing mania, to develop a [[therapeutic alliance]] in support of [[recovery model|recovery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 16170918 | volume=59 | journal = American journal of psychotherapy | issue=2 | title = Existential despair and bipolar disorder: the therapeutic alliance as a mood stabilizer. | year=2005 | pages=137–47 | author=Havens LL, Ghaemi SN | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medication===
[[File:Sodium-valproate-2D-skeletal.png|thumb|[[Sodium valproate]] is a common mood stabilizer]]
The mainstay of treatment is a [[mood stabilizer]]s such as [[lithium carbonate]] or [[lamotrigine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Geddes JR, Burgess S, Hawton K, Jamison K, Goodwin GM |title=Long-term lithium therapy for bipolar disorder: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials |journal=Am J Psychiatry |volume=161 |issue=2 |pages=217–22 |year=2004 |month=February |pmid=14754766 |doi= 10.1176/appi.ajp.161.2.217|url=|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Bauer MS, Mitchner L |title=What is a &quot;mood stabilizer&quot;?

==Prognosis==
For many individuals with bipolar disorder a good [[prognosis]] results from good treatment, which, in turn, results from an accurate [[medical diagnosis|diagnosis]]. Because bipolar disorder can have a high rate of both under-diagnosis and [[misdiagnosis]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowden&quot;/&gt; it is often difficult for individuals with the condition to receive timely and competent treatment.

Bipolar disorder can be a severely disabling medical condition. However, many individuals with bipolar disorder can live full and satisfying lives. Quite often, medication is needed to enable this. Persons with bipolar disorder may have periods of normal or near normal functioning between episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Riding the Roller Coaster: Living with Mood Disorders |author=Bergen M |year=1999 |publisher=Wood Lake Publishing Inc.|url=http://books.google.com/?id=s4dVLeND9l0C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=riding%20the%20roller%20coaster%2C%20living%20with%20mood&amp;pg=PA26#v=onepage&amp;q= |isbn=9781896836317}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prognosis depends on many factors such as the right medicines and dosage, comprehensive knowledge of the disease and its effects; a positive relationship with a competent medical doctor and therapist; and good physical health, which includes exercise, nutrition, and a regulated stress level. There are other factors that lead to a good prognosis, such as being very aware of small changes in a person's energy, mood, sleep and eating behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Introduction|url=http://www.cs.umd.edu/class/spring2004/cmsc434/teams/rise/Introduction.htm|publisher=cs.umd.edu|accessdate=February 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Functioning===
A recent 20-year prospective study on bipolar I and II found that functioning varied over time along a spectrum from good to fair to poor. During periods of [[major depression]] or mania (in BPI), functioning was on average poor, with depression being more persistently associated with disability than mania. Functioning between episodes was on average good&amp;nbsp;— more or less normal. Subthreshold symptoms were generally still substantially impairing, however, except for hypomania (below or above threshold) which was associated with improved functioning.&lt;ref&gt;Judd Lewis L.; Aksikal Hagop S.; Schettler Pamela J. ; Endicott Jean; Leon Andrew C.; Solomon David A.; Coryell William; Maser Jack D.; Keller Martin B.

Another study confirmed the seriousness of the disorder as &quot;the standardized all-cause mortality ratio among patients with BD is increased approximately two-fold.&quot; Bipolar disorder is currently regarded &quot;as possibly the most costly category of mental disorders in the United States.&quot; Episodes of abnormality are associated with distress and disruption, and an elevated risk of [[suicide]], especially during depressive episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Ösby | first = U | last2 = Brandt | first2 = L | last3 = Correia | first3 = N | last4 = Ekbom | first4 = A | last5 = Sparén | first5 = P | title = Excess Mortality in Bipolar and Unipolar Disorder in Sweden | journal = Archives of General Psychiatry | volume = 58 | issue = 9 | pages = 844–850 | year = 2001 | url = http://archpsyc.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/58/9/844 | doi = 10.1001/archpsyc.58.9.844 | pmid = 11545667| ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recovery and recurrence===
A naturalistic study from first admission for mania or mixed episode (representing the hospitalized and therefore most severe cases) found that 50% achieved syndromal recovery (no longer meeting criteria for the diagnosis) within six weeks and 98% within two years. 72% achieved symptomatic recovery (no symptoms at all) and 43% achieved functional recovery (regaining of prior occupational and residential status). However, 40% went on to experience a new episode of mania or depression within 2 years of syndromal recovery, and 19% switched phases without recovery.&lt;ref&gt;Tohen M, Zarate CA Jr, Hennen J, Khalsa HM, Strakowski SM, Gebre-Medhin P, Salvatore P, Baldessarini RJ.

==History==
{{Main|History of bipolar disorder}}
Variations in moods and energy levels have been observed as part of the human experience since time immemorial. The words &quot;[[melancholia]]&quot; (an old word for [[depression (mood)|depression]]) and &quot;mania&quot; have their [[etymologies]] in [[Ancient Greek]]. The word melancholia is derived from ''melas''/μελας, meaning &quot;black&quot;, and ''chole''/χολη, meaning &quot;bile&quot; or &quot;gall&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Liddell 1980&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| author = [[Henry George Liddell|Liddell, Henry George]] and [[Robert Scott (philologist)|Robert Scott]] | year = 1980 | title = [[A Greek-English Lexicon]] (Abridged Edition) | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | location = United Kingdom | isbn = 0-19-910207-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; indicative of the term's origins in pre-[[Hippocrates|Hippocratic]] [[humoral]] theories. Within the humoral theories, mania was viewed as arising from an excess of [[yellow bile]], or a mixture of black and yellow bile. The [[linguistics|linguistic]] origins of mania, however, are not so clear-cut. Several etymologies are proposed by the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] physician [[Caelius Aurelianus]], including the Greek word ‘ania’, meaning to produce great mental anguish, and ‘manos’, meaning relaxed or loose, which would contextually approximate to an excessive relaxing of the mind or soul (Angst and Marneros 2001). There are at least five other candidates, and part of the confusion surrounding the exact etymology of the word mania is its varied usage in the pre-Hippocratic [[poetry]] and [[mythology|mythologies]] (Angst and Marneros 2001).

The basis of the current conceptualisation of manic-depressive illness can be traced back to the 1850s; on January 31, 1854, [[Jules Baillarger]] described to the French Imperial [[Academy of Medicine]] a [[biphasic]] [[mental illness]] causing recurrent oscillations between mania and depression, which he termed ''folie à double forme'' (‘dual-form insanity’).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15506718 |title=Circular insanity, 150 years on |accessdate=2008-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two weeks later, on February 14, 1854, [[Jean-Pierre Falret]] presented a description to the Academy on what was essentially the same disorder, and designated ''folie circulaire'' (‘circular [[insanity]]’) by him.(Sedler 1983) The two bitterly disputed as to who had been the first to conceptualise the condition.

These concepts were developed by the German [[psychiatrist]] [[Emil Kraepelin]] (1856–1926), who, using [[Karl Ludwig Kahlbaum|Kahlbaum]]'s concept of [[cyclothymia]],&lt;ref name=&quot;millon&quot;&gt;{{Cite book

He coined the term ''manic depressive [[psychosis]]'', after noting that periods of acute illness, manic or depressive, were generally punctuated by relatively symptom-free intervals where the patient was able to function normally.&lt;ref&gt;[[Emil Kraepelin|Kraepelin, Emil]] (1921) ''Manic-depressive Insanity and Paranoia'' ISBN 0-405-07441-7&lt;/ref&gt;

The term &quot;manic-depressive ''reaction''&quot; appeared in the first [[American Psychiatric Association]] Diagnostic Manual in 1952, influenced by the legacy of [[Adolf Meyer (psychiatrist)|Adolf Meyer]] who had introduced the paradigm illness as a reaction of biogenetic factors to psychological and social influences.&lt;ref&gt;Goodwin &amp; Jamison. pp. 60–61.&lt;/ref&gt; Subclassification of bipolar disorder was first proposed by German psychiatrist [[Karl Leonhard]] in 1957; he was also the first to introduce the terms ''bipolar'' (for those with mania) and ''unipolar'' (for those with depressive episodes only).&lt;ref&gt;Goodwin &amp; Jamison. p62&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kay Redfield Jamison]], a clinical psychologist and Professor of Psychiatry at the [[Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine]], profiled her own bipolar disorder in her memoir ''[[An Unquiet Mind]]'' (1995).&lt;ref name=&quot;unquiet&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Jamison|first=Kay Redfield|title=An Unquiet Mind: A Memoir of Moods and Madness|publisher=Knopf.|location=New York|year=1995|isbn=0-330-34651-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her book, ''[[Touched with Fire]]'' (1993), she argued for a connection between bipolar disorder and artistic creativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Jamison |first=Kay Redfield|title=Touched With Fire: Manic-Depressive Illness and the Artistic Temperament|publisher=The Free Press: Macmillian, Inc.|location=New York|year=1996|isbn=0-684-83183-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several films have portrayed characters with traits suggestive of the diagnosis that has been the subject of discussion by psychiatrists and film experts alike. A notable example is ''[[Mr. Jones (film)|Mr. Jones]]'' (1993), in which Mr. Jones ([[Richard Gere]]) swings from a manic episode into a depressive phase and back again, spending time in a psychiatric hospital and displaying many of the features of the syndrome.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Reel Psychiatry:Movie Portrayals of Psychiatric Conditions|author=Robinson DJ |year= 2003|publisher=Rapid Psychler Press |location=Port Huron, Michigan |isbn=1-894328-07-8|pages=78–81}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The Mosquito Coast]]'' (1986), Allie Fox ([[Harrison Ford]]) displays some features including recklessness, grandiosity, increased goal-directed activity and mood lability, as well as some paranoia.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson (''Reel Psychiatry:Movie Portrayals of Psychiatric Conditions''), p. 84–85&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Australian TV drama ''Stingers'', Detective Luke Harris (Gary Sweet) is portrayed as having bipolar disorder and shows how his paranoia interfered with his work. As research for the role, Sweet visited a psychiatrist to learn about manic-depressive illness. He said that he left the sessions convinced he had the condition.
[[TV special]]s, for example the [[BBC]]'s ''[[The Secret Life of the Manic Depressive]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/health/tv_and_radio/secretlife_index.shtml|title=The Secret Life of the Manic Depressive|publisher=BBC|year=2006|accessdate = February 20, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; MTV's ''[[True Life]]: I'm Bipolar'', talk shows, and public radio shows, and the greater willingness of public figures to discuss their own bipolar disorder, have focused on psychiatric conditions, thereby, raising public awareness.

On April 7, 2009, the nighttime drama ''[[90210 (TV series)|90210]]'' on the [[The CW|CW]] network, aired a [[very special episode|special episode]] where the character Silver was diagnosed with bipolar disorder.  A public service announcement ([[Public service announcement|PSA]]) aired after the episode, directing teens and young adults to the Child and Adolescent Bipolar Foundation website for information and to chat with other teens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bpkids.org/90210|title=Child and Adolescent Bipolar Foundation special 90210 website|publisher=CABF|year=2009|accessdate=April 7, 2009}}{{dead link|date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stacey Slater]], a character from the popular BBC soap [[EastEnders]], has been diagnosed with the disorder. After losing her friend Danielle Jones, Stacey began acting strangely; and the character had to come to terms with the prospect that, like her mother, [[Jean Slater]], she suffers from bipolar disorder. The high-profile storyline was developed as part of the BBC's Headroom campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2009/05_may/14/stacey.shtml|title=EastEnders' Stacey faces bipolar disorder|publisher=BBC Press Office|date=May 14, 2009|accessdate=May 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Channel 4]] soap ''[[Brookside]]'' had earlier featured a story about bipolar disorder when the character [[Jimmy Corkhill]] was diagnosed with the condition.&lt;ref name=Echo14May2003&gt;{{Cite news|title= The Brookie boys who shone at soap awards show|publisher= Mirror Group Newspapers|work= Liverpool Echo|first= Rachael|last= Tinniswood|date= May 14, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dean Sullivan]], the actor who played Jimmy, was presented with a Special Achievement Award at the 2003 [[British Soap Awards]] for the role.&lt;ref name=Echo14May2003/&gt;

[[Emil Kraepelin]] in the 1920s noted that mania episodes were rare before puberty.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17195735&quot;/&gt; In general BD in children was not recognized in the first half of the XX century this issue diminishing with an increased following of the DSM criteria in the last part of the XXth century.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17195735&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-7610.1960.tb01979.x | last1 = Anthony | first1 =  James| last2 = Scott | first2 =  Peter| year = 1960 | title = Manic-depressive psychosis in childhood | url = | journal = Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 53–72 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While in adults the course of BD is characterized by discrete episodes of depression and mania with no clear symptomatology between them, in chidren and adolescents very fast mood changes or even chronic symptoms are the norm.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17716034&quot;/&gt; On the other hand pediactric BD instead of [[euphoria|euphoric]] [[mania]] commonly develops with outbursts of anger, irritability and [[psychosis]], less common in adults.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17195735&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17716034&quot;/&gt;

The diagnosis of childhood BD is controversial,&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17716034&quot;/&gt; although it is not under discussion that BD typical symptoms have negative consequences for minors suffering them.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17195735&quot;/&gt; Main discussion is centered on whether what is called BD in children refers to the same disorder than when diagnosing adults,&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17195735&quot;/&gt; and the related question on whether adults criteria for diagnosis are useful and accurate when applied to children.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17716034&quot;/&gt; Regarding diagnosis of children some experts recommend to follow the DSM criteria.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17716034&quot;/&gt; Others believe that these criteria do not separate correctly children with BD from other problems such as ADHD, and emphasize fast mood cycles.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17716034&quot;/&gt; Still others argue that what accurately differentiates children with BD is irritability.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17716034&quot;/&gt; The practice parameters of the [[American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry|AACAP]] encourage the first strategy.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17195735&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17716034&quot;/&gt; American children and adolescents diagnosed of BD in community hospitals increased 4-fold reaching rates of up to 40% in 10 years around the beginning of the current century, while in [[outpatient]] clinics it doubled reaching the 6%.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17716034&quot;/&gt; The data suggest that doctors had been more aggressively applying the [[medical diagnosis|diagnosis]] to children.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} The reasons for this increase are unclear.

===In the elderly===
There is a relative lack of knowledge about bipolar disorder in late life. There is evidence that it becomes less prevalent with age but nevertheless accounts for a similar percentage of psychiatric admissions; that older bipolar patients had first experienced symptoms at a later age; that later onset of mania is associated with more neurologic impairment; that substance abuse is considerably less common in older groups; and that there is probably a greater degree of variation in presentation and course, for instance individuals may develop new-onset mania associated with vascular changes, or become manic only after recurrent depressive episodes, or may have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder at an early age and still meet criteria. There is also some weak evidence that mania is less intense and there is a higher prevalence of mixed episodes, although there may be a reduced response to treatment. Overall there are likely more similarities than differences from younger adults.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15383127&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Depp CA, Jeste DV |title=Bipolar disorder in older adults: a critical review |journal=Bipolar Disord |volume=6 |issue=5 |pages=343–67 |year=2004 |month=October |pmid=15383127 |doi=10.1111/j.1399-5618.2004.00139.x |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the elderly, recognition and treatment of bipolar disorder may be complicated by the presence of [[dementia]] or the side effects of medications being taken for other conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Trinh NH, Forester B|title=Bipolar Disorder in the Elderly: Differential Diagnosis and Treatment |journal=Psychiatric Times|volume=24 |issue=14 |year=2007 |url=http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/bipolar-disorder/article/10168/54481|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}

'''Burton Stephen &quot;Burt&quot; Lancaster''' (November 2, 1913{{ndash}} October 20, 1994) was an American film actor noted for his athletic physique and distinctive smile (which he called &quot;The Grin&quot;). Later he took roles that went against his initial &quot;tough guy&quot; image. In the late 1950s Lancaster abandoned his &quot;all-American&quot; image and came to be regarded as one of the best actors of his generation.  

Lancaster was nominated four times for [[Academy Award]]s and won once — for his work in ''[[Elmer Gantry (film)|Elmer Gantry]]'' in 1960. He also won a [[Golden Globe]] for that performance and [[BAFTA Award]]s for ''[[Birdman of Alcatraz (film)|The Birdman of Alcatraz]]'' (1962) and ''[[Atlantic City (1980 film)|Atlantic City]]'' (1980).  His production company, Hecht-Hill-Lancaster, was the most successful and innovative star-driven independent production company in Hollywood of the 1950s, making movies such as ''[[Marty]]'' (1955), ''[[Trapeze (film)|Trapeze]]'' (1956), and ''[[Sweet Smell of Success]]'' (1957).

Lancaster also directed two films: ''[[The Kentuckian]]'' (1955) and ''[[The Midnight Man (1974 film)|The Midnight Man]]'' (1974). 

In 1999, the [[American Film Institute]] named Lancaster nineteenth among the [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Stars|greatest male stars of all time]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://connect.afi.com/site/DocServer/stars50.pdf?docID=262 |title=America's Greatest Legends |publisher=[[American Film Institute]] |accessdate=July 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Lancaster was born in New York City, at his parents' home at 209 East 106th Street, between Second and Third Avenues, today the site of Benjamin Franklin Plaza.  Lancaster was the son of Elizabeth (née Roberts) and James Henry Lancaster, who was a postman.&lt;ref name=&quot;buford&quot;&gt;{{cite book

  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both of his parents were [[Protestantism|Protestant]]s of working-class [[Irish people|Irish]] origin. Lancaster's grandparents were immigrants to the U.S. from [[Belfast]] and descendants of English immigrants to [[Ireland]].&lt;ref name=&quot;buford&quot;/&gt; Lancaster's family believed themselves to be related to [[Frederick Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts]]. Lancaster grew up in [[East Harlem]] and spent much of his time on the streets, where he developed great interest and skill in gymnastics while attending the [[DeWitt Clinton High School]],&lt;ref name=&quot;buford&quot;/&gt; where he was a basketball star. Before he graduated from DeWitt Clinton, his mother died of a cerebral hemorrhage. Lancaster was accepted into [[New York University]] with an athletics scholarship but subsequently dropped out.

==Circus career and military==
At the age of 9, Lancaster met [[Nick Cravat]], with whom he continued to work throughout his life. Together they learned to act in local theater productions and circus arts at [[Union Settlement Association|Union Settlement]], one of the city's oldest settlement houses.&lt;ref name=&quot;buford&quot;/&gt; They formed the acrobat duo &quot;Lang and Cravat&quot; and soon joined the Kay Brothers circus. However, in 1939 an injury forced Lancaster to give up the profession, with great regret. (He would later be reunited with Cravat in nine films: ''[[The Flame and the Arrow]]'', ''[[The Crimson Pirate]]'', ''[[Run Silent, Run Deep]]'', ''[[The Scalphunters]]'', ''[[Airport (1970 film)|Airport]]'', ''[[Valdez Is Coming]]'', ''[[Ulzana's Raid]]'', ''[[The Midnight Man (1974 film)|The Midnight Man]]'' and ''[[The Island of Dr. Moreau (1977 film)|The Island of Dr. Moreau]]''.) He then found temporary work until 1942 — first as a salesman for [[Marshall Fields]], and then as a singing waiter in various restaurants.

The United States having then entered World War II, Lancaster joined the [[United States Army]] and performed with the Army's Twenty-First [[Special Services (entertainment)|Special Services]] Division, one of the military groups organized to follow the troops on the ground and provide [[USO]] entertainment to keep up morale. He served with [[Mark W. Clark|General Mark Clark's]] [[United States Army North|Fifth Army]] in Italy from 1943–1945.

==Film career==
===Acting===
[[File:Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr in From Here to Eternity trailer.jpg|left|thumb|with [[Deborah Kerr]] in ''[[From Here to Eternity]]'' (1953)]]
Though initially unenthusiastic about acting, he returned from service, auditioned for a Broadway play, and was offered a role. Although [[Harry Brown (writer)|Harry Brown]]'s ''A Sound of Hunting'' was not successful, Lancaster's performance drew the attention of a Hollywood agent, [[Harold Hecht]], who introduced him to [[Hal Wallis]], who  cast Lancaster in ''[[The Killers (1946 film)|The Killers]]'' (1946). (Hecht and Lancaster later formed several production companies in the 1950s to give Lancaster greater creative control.) The tall, muscular actor won significant acclaim and appeared in two more films the following year. Subsequently, he played in a variety of films, especially in dramas, [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]]s, and military and adventure films. In two, ''[[The Flame and the Arrow]]'' and ''[[The Crimson Pirate]],'' a friend from his circus years, [[Nick Cravat]], played a key supporting role, and both actors impressed audiences with their acrobatic prowess. 

In 1953, Lancaster played one of his best remembered roles with [[Deborah Kerr]] in ''[[From Here to Eternity]].'' The [[American Film Institute]] acknowledged the iconic status of the scene from that film in which he and Deborah Kerr make love on a Hawaiian beach amid the crashing waves. The organization named it one of &quot;AFI's top 100 Most Romantic Films&quot; of all time. 

Lancaster won the 1960 [[Academy Award for Best Actor]], a [[Golden Globe Award]], and the [[New York Film Critics Award]] for his performance in ''[[Elmer Gantry (film)|Elmer Gantry]].'' 

In 1968, at the age of 54, Lancaster appeared nude in director [[Frank Perry]]'s film, ''[[The Swimmer (film)|The Swimmer]]''.

During the latter part of his career, Lancaster left adventure and acrobatic movies behind and portrayed more distinguished characters. This period brought him work on several European productions, with directors such as [[Luchino Visconti]] and [[Bernardo Bertolucci]]. Lancaster sought demanding roles, and if he liked a part or a director, he was prepared to work for much lower pay than he might have earned elsewhere. He even helped to finance movies the artistic value of which he believed in. He also mentored directors such as [[Sydney Pollack]] and [[John Frankenheimer]] and appeared in several TV films.

For his contribution to the motion picture industry, Lancaster has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 6801 Hollywood Boulevard.

===Directing and producing===
Lancaster was an early and successful actor/producer. In 1952, Lancaster co-produced ''{{sortname|The|Crimson Pirate}}'' with producer [[Harold Hecht]] (who had previously produced three Lancaster films under his own production company Norma Productions; ''[[Kiss the Blood Off My Hands]]'' (1948), ''[[The Flame and the Arrow]]'' (1950) and ''[[Ten Tall Men]]'' (1951)). In 1954, they collaborated again on ''[[His Majesty O'Keefe]]'', with Lancaster acting and Hecht producing. The writer for this film was [[James Hill]]. The trio started a production company, originally with Hill as a silent partner, under the name &quot;Hecht-Lancaster&quot;. The name was later extended to include all three with &quot;Hecht-Hill-Lancaster&quot;. Together they produced the films ''[[Apache (film)|Apache]]'' (1954), ''[[Vera Cruz (film)|Vera Cruz]]'' (1954), ''[[Marty (film)|Marty]]'' (1955), ''[[The Kentuckian]]'' (1955), ''[[Trapeze (film)|Trapeze]]'' (1956), ''[[The Bachelor Party]]'' (1956), ''[[Sweet Smell of Success]]'' (1957), ''[[Run Silent, Run Deep]]'' (1958), ''[[Separate Tables (film)|Separate Tables]]'' (1958), ''{{sortname|The|Devil's Disciple|The Devil's Disciple (1959 film)}}'' (1959), ''[[Take a Giant Step]]'' (1959), ''[[Summer of the Seventeenth Doll]]'' (1960) and ''{{sortname|The|Unforgiven|The Unforgiven (1960 film)}}'' (1960). The company dissolved in 1960, but Hecht would produce two more films in which Lancaster acted, under Norma Productions, ''{{sortname|The|Young Savages}}'' (1961) and ''[[Birdman of Alcatraz (film)|Birdman of Alcatraz]]'' (1962). Twelve years later, Hecht and Lancaster produced ''[[Ulzana's Raid]]'' (1972) together.

In the late 1960s, Lancaster teamed with [[Roland Kibbee]] to form &quot;Norlan Productions&quot; and produce ''{{sortname|The|Scalphunters}}'' (1968), ''[[Valdez Is Coming]]'' (1971) and ''[[The Midnight Man (1974 film)|The Midnight Man]]'' (1974).

In addition, Lancaster directed two films. ''[[The Kentuckian]]'' in 1955 and ''[[The Midnight Man (1974 film)|The Midnight Man]]'' in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;Buford, Kate (2008). ''Burt Lancaster: An American Life''. Aurum Press. ISBN 1845133854.&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;The Midnight Man&quot; was in fact starred in, co-written, produced, and directed by Lancaster.

===Frequent collaborations===
Apart from acting in a total of seventeen films produced by [[Harold Hecht]], Lancaster also appeared in eight films produced by [[Hal B. Wallis]].

Lancaster made six films over the years with [[Kirk Douglas]], including ''[[I Walk Alone]]'' (1948), ''[[Gunfight at the O.K. Corral (film)|Gunfight at the O.K. Corral]]'' (1957), ''[[The Devil's Disciple (1959 film)|The Devil's Disciple]]'' (1959), ''[[The List of Adrian Messenger]]'' (1963), ''[[Seven Days in May]]'' (1964) and ''[[Tough Guys (1986 film)|Tough Guys]]'' (1986) which fixed the notion of the pair as something of a team in the public imagination. The connection was firmly cemented by the time Lancaster and Douglas reteamed for their final movie, ''[[Tough Guys (1986 film)|Tough Guys]]'' (1986). Although Douglas was always second billed under Lancaster in these films, with the exceptions of ''I Walk Alone,'' in which Douglas played a villain, and ''[[The List of Adrian Messenger]]'' (1963), for which Lancaster rendered a brief cameo, their roles were usually more or less the same size.

He also often asked his close friend [[Nick Cravat]] to appear in his films. They co-starred together in nine films; [[The Flame and the Arrow]] (1952), ''[[Ten Tall Men]]'' (1951), ''{{sortname|The|Crimson Pirate}}'' (1952), ''[[Run Silent, Run Deep]]'' (1958), ''{{sortname|The|Scalphunters}}'' (1968), ''[[Airport (1970 film)|Airport]]'' (1970), ''[[Valdez Is Coming]]'' (1971), ''[[Ulzana's Raid]]'' (1972), ''[[The Midnight Man (1974 film)|The Midnight Man]]'' (1974) and ''{{sortname|The|Island of Dr. Moreau |The Island of Dr. Moreau (1977 film)}}'' (1977).

In addition, [[John Frankenheimer]] directed five films with Lancaster; ''[[The Young Savages]]'' (1961), ''[[Birdman of Alcatraz]]'' (1962), ''[[Seven Days in May]]'' (1964), ''[[The Train (film)|The Train]]'' (1964) and ''[[The Gypsy Moths]]'' (1969).

Lancaster used make-up veteran Robert Schiffer in twenty credited films. Lancaster hired Schiffer on nearly all the films he produced.

==Personal life==
===Marriages and relationships===
Lancaster vigorously guarded his private life. He was married three times. His first two marriages ended in divorce — to June Ernst from 1935 to 1946 and to Norma Anderson from 1946 to 1969. His third marriage, to Susan Martin, was from September 1990 until his death in 1994. All five of his children were with Norma Anderson: [[Bill Lancaster|Bill]] (who became a screenwriter), James, Susan, Joanna, and Sighle (pronounced Sheila). He claims he was romantically involved with [[Deborah Kerr]] during the filming of ''[[From Here to Eternity]]'' in 1953.&lt;ref name=&quot;buford&quot;/&gt; However Ms. Kerr had stated that while there was a spark of attraction, nothing ever happened.  He also had an affair with [[Joan Blondell]]. In her 1980 autobiography, actress [[Shelley Winters]] claimed to have had a long affair with him.

===Political views===
Lancaster was a vocal supporter of [[liberalism|liberal]] political causes, and frequently spoke out in support of [[racial minorities]]. He was a vocal opponent of the [[Vietnam War]] and political movements such as  [[McCarthyism]], and he helped pay for the successful defense of a soldier accused of &quot;[[fragging]]&quot; (murdering) another soldier during the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;buford&quot;/&gt; In 1968, Lancaster actively supported the presidential candidacy of [[antiwar]] Senator [[Eugene McCarthy]] of [[Minnesota]], and frequently spoke on his behalf during the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] primaries. In 1985, Lancaster, a longtime supporter of [[gay rights]], joined the fight against AIDS after his close friend, [[Rock Hudson]], contracted the disease. He campaigned for [[Michael Dukakis]] in the [[U.S. presidential election, 1988|1988 presidential election]].

===Health problems and death===

As Lancaster grew older, heart trouble increasingly hindered him from working. He nearly died during a routine [[gall bladder]] operation in January 1980. Following two minor heart attacks he had to undergo an emergency quadruple [[heart bypass]] in 1983, after which he was in frail health. He suffered a severe stroke in November 1990, which left him partly [[paralysis|paralyzed]] and with restricted speech. Lancaster died in his [[Century City]] apartment in Los Angeles from a third heart attack on October 20, 1994 at the age of 80.

{{Indo-European topics|283}}

The '''Balts''' or '''Baltic peoples''' (People who live by the [[Baltic Sea#Etymology|Baltic Sea]]), defined as speakers of one of the [[Baltic languages]], a branch of the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European language]] family, are descended from  a group of [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European]] tribes who settled the area between the [[Jutland]] peninsula in the west and [[Moscow River|Moscow]], [[Oka River|Oka]] and [[Volga]] rivers basins in the east. One of the features of Baltic languages is the number of conservative or archaic features retained.&lt;ref&gt;Bojtár page 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the Baltic peoples are modern [[Lithuanians]], [[Latvians]] (including [[Latgalians (modern)|Latgalians]]) — all Eastern Balts — as well as the [[Old Prussians|Prussians]], [[Yotvingians]] and [[Galindians]] — the Western Balts — whose languages and cultures are now extinct.

[[Adam of Bremen]] was the first writer to use the term Baltic in its modern sense to mean the sea of that name.&lt;ref name=Bot_9&gt;Bojtár page 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Although he must have been familiar with the ancient name, Balcia,&lt;ref&gt;Balcia, Abalcia, Abalus, Basilia, Balisia. The linguistic problem with these names is that Balcia cannot become Baltia by known rule.&lt;/ref&gt;  meaning a supposed island in the Baltic Sea,&lt;ref name=Bot_9/&gt; and although he may have been aware of the Baltic words containing the stem balt-, &quot;white&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{lang-lv|balti}}; {{lang-lt|baltai}}; [[Latgalian language|Latgalian]]: ''bolti'', lit. ''&quot;white&quot;''.&lt;/ref&gt; as &quot;swamp&quot;, he reports that he followed the local use of balticus from baelt (&quot;belt&quot;) because the sea stretches to the east &quot;in modum baltei&quot; (&quot;in the manner of a belt&quot;). This is the first reference to &quot;the Baltic or Barbarian Sea, a day's journey from [[Hamburg]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bojtár cites ''Bremensis'' I,60 and IV,10.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Germanics, however, preferred some form of &quot;East Sea&quot; (in different languages) until after about 1600, when they began to use forms of &quot;Baltic Sea.&quot; Around 1840 the German nobles of the [[Governorate of Livonia]] devised the term &quot;Balts&quot; to mean themselves, the German upper classes of Livonia, excluding the Latvian and Estonian lower classes. They spoke an exclusive dialect, baltisch-deutsch, legally spoken by them alone. For all practical purposes that was the Baltic language until 1919.&lt;ref&gt;Bojtár page 10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The New Eastern Europe|first=Ralph|last=Butler|year=1919|pages=3, 21, 22, 23, 24|publisher=Longmans, Green and Co.|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Scandinavians]] begin settling in Western Baltic lands in [[Lithuania]] and [[Latvia]].

Meanwhile in 1845 [[Georg Heinrich Ferdinand Nesselmann]] proposed a distinct language group for [[Latvian language|Latvian]] and [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] to be called Baltic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=William R.|last=Schmalstieg|title=A. Sabaliauskas. Mes Baltai (We Balts)|journal=Lituanus: Lithuanian Quarterly Journal of Arts and Sciences|volume=33|date=Fall 1987|publisher=Lituanus Foundation Incorporated|url=http://www.lituanus.org/1987/87_3_09.htm|accessdate=2008-09-06|issue=3}} Book review.&lt;/ref&gt; It found some credence among linguists but was not generally adopted until the creation of the [[Baltic states]] as part of the settlement of [[World War I]] in 1919. Gradually the non-Baltic [[Estonian language|Estonian]] was excluded from the [[linguistic meaning]] of Baltic, as was [[Livonians|Livonian]], a now rare [[Finnic peoples|Finnic language]] in Latvia, while [[Old Prussian]] — long recognized as close to Lithuanian and Latvian — was added. [[Estonia]] remained, however, among the [[Baltic states]] in the geopolitical sense.

==Prehistory==
===Indo-European arrivals===
[[Image:Corded Ware culture.png|thumb|250px|left|[[Corded Ware culture]] in Europe]]
It is ''possible'' that around 3,500-2,500 B.C., there was massive migration of peoples representing the [[Corded Ware culture]]. They came from the southeast and spread all across Eastern and Central Europe, reaching even southern Finland. It is believed that [[Corded Ware culture]] peoples were [[Indo-European]] ancestors of many Europeans, including Balts. It is thought that those Indo-European newcomers were quite numerous and in the Eastern Baltic assimilated earlier indigenous cultures (Europidic cultures - [[Narva culture]] and [[Neman culture]]). Over time the new people formed the Baltic peoples and they spread in the area from the Baltic sea in the west to the [[Volga]] in the east.

===Formation of a Baltic homeland===
The Balts or Baltic peoples, defined as speakers of one of the Baltic languages, a branch of the Indo-European language family, are descended from a group of Indo-European tribes who settled the area between the lower Vistula and upper Daugava and Dnieper rivers on the southeast shore of the Baltic Sea. Because the thousands of lakes and swamps in this area contributed to the Balts' geographical isolation, the Baltic languages retain a number of conservative or archaic features.

Some of the major authorities on Balts, such as [[Kazimieras Būga|Būga]], [[Max Vasmer|Vasmer]], [[Toporov]] and Trubachov, in conducting etymological studies of eastern European river names, were able to identify in certain regions names of specifically Baltic provenance, which most likely indicate where the Balts lived in prehistoric times. This information is summarized and synthesized by [[Marija Gimbutas]] in ''The Balts'' (1963) to obtain a likely proto-Baltic homeland. Its borders are approximately: from a line on the [[Pomerania]]n coast eastward to include or nearly include the present-day sites of [[Warsaw]], [[Kiev]], and [[Kursk]], northward through [[Moscow]] to the River Berzha, westward in an irregular line to the coast of the Gulf of Riga, north of [[Riga]].

==Proto-history==
In 98 AD [[Tacitus]] described one of the tribes living near the Baltic Sea (''Mare Svebicum'') as ''Aestiorum gentes'', or [[amber]] gatherers. It is believed that these peoples were inhabitants of the [[Sambia (Baltic)|Sambian]] peninsula, although no other contemporary sources exist.

This homeland includes all historical Balts and every location where Balts are thought to have been at different periods in time. Over time the huge area of Baltic habitation shrank, due to assimilations with other groups and invasions. It is interesting to point out that according to one of the theories, which has gained considerable traction over the years, one of the western Baltic tribes, [[Galindians]], [[Galindae|Baltic occupation of Western Russia]], Goliad migrated to the Eastern end of Baltic realm around the 4th century AD and settled around modern day Moscow, Russia. Finally, according to Slavic chronicles of the time they were warring with [[Slavic peoples|Slavs]], and perhaps, were defeated and assimilated some time in 11-13 centuries.

Balts differentiated into Western and Eastern Balts in late centuries BC. The eastern Baltic was inhabited by ancestors of [[Western Balts]] - [[Old Prussians]], [[Sudovians]]/[[Jotvingians]], [[Scalvians]], [[Nadruvians]], and [[Curonians]]. On the other hand, Eastern Balts were living in modern day Belarus, Ukraine and Russia. Subsequent [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] and [[Goths|Gothic]] domination of first half of the first millennium AD in the Northern and Eastern Europe, as well as later Slavic expansion caused large migration of the Balts. First, [[Galindae]] or [[Galindians]] to the East and, later, Eastern Balts to the West, until they reached the ethnographic area of the Balts as we know since 13th-14th centuries. Many other eastern and Southern Balts either  assimilated with other Balts or contributed to the formation of the Slavs in the 4th-7th centuries, and later gradually were slavicized.

==History==

In the 12th and the 13th centuries, internal struggles, as well as invasions by [[Ruthenians]] and [[Poles]] and later the expansion of the [[Teutonic Order]] resulted in an almost complete annihilation of the Galindians, Curonians, and Yotvingians. Gradually Old Prussians became [[germanization|Germanized]] or some Lithuanized during 15 -17 c., especially after the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] in [[Prussia]]. The cultures of the Lithuanians and Latgalians/Latvians survived and became the ancestors of the populations of the modern countries of [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]].

Old Prussian was closely related to the other extinct Western [[Baltic language]]s, [[Curonian language|Curonian]], [[Galindian language|Galindian]] and [[Sudovian language|Sudovian]]. It is more distantly related to the surviving Eastern [[Baltic language]]s, [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] and [[Latvian language|Latvian]]. Compare the Prussian word ''seme'' (''zemē''),&lt;ref name = &quot;Lie&quot;&gt;Mikkels Klussis. ''Bāziscas prûsiskai-laîtawiskas wirdeîns per tālaisin laksikis rekreaciônin [http://donelaitis.vdu.lt/prussian/Lie.pdf Donelaitis.vdu.lt] (Lithuanian version of [http://donelaitis.vdu.lt/prussian/Engl.pdf Donelaitis.vdu.lt).]&lt;/ref&gt; the Latvian ''zeme'', the Lithuanian ''žemė''.

Old Prussian contained a few borrowings specifically from [[Gothic language|Gothic]] (e.g., Old Prussian ''ylo'' &quot;awl,&quot; as with Lithuanian ''ýla'', Latvian ''īlens'') and even [[Scandinavian languages]].

'''Burnt-in timecode''' (often abbreviated to '''BITC''' by analogy to [[Timecode/Vertical interval timecode|VITC]]) is a [[human-readable]] on-screen version of the [[timecode]] information for a piece of material superimposed on a video image. BITC is sometimes used in conjunction with &quot;real&quot; machine-readable timecode, but more often used in copies of original material on to a non-broadcast format such as VHS, so that the VHS copies can be traced back to their master tape and the original time codes easily located. 

Many professional [[VTR]]s can &quot;burn&quot; (overlay) the tape timecode onto one of their [[composite video|composite]] outputs. This output (which usually also displays the setup menu or [[on-screen display]]) is known as the ''super out'' or ''monitor out''. The ''character'' switch or menu item turns this behaviour on or off. The ''character'' function is also used to display the timecode on the preview monitors in [[linear video editing|linear editing]] suites.

Videotapes that are recorded with timecode numbers overlaid on the video are referred to as ''window dubs'', named after the &quot;window&quot; that displays the burnt-in timecode on-screen.

Timecode can also be superimposed on video using a dedicated overlay device, often called a &quot;window dub inserter&quot;.  This inputs a video signal and its separate timecode audio signal, reads the timecode, superimposes the timecode display over the video, and outputs the combined display (usually via composite), all in real time.  Stand-alone timecode generator / readers often have the window dub function built-in.  

Some consumer cameras, in particular DV cameras, can &quot;burn&quot; (overlay) the tape timecode onto the composite output. This output typically is semi-transparent and may include other tape information. It is usually activated by turning on the 'display' info in one of the camera's sub-menus. While not as 'professional' as an overlay as created by a professional [[VCR]]s, it is a cheap alternative that is just as accurate.

Timecode is stored in the metadata areas of captured DV AVI files, and some software is able to &quot;burn&quot; (overlay) this into the video frames. For example, DVMP Pro&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dvmp.co.uk/dv-media-player-pro.htm DVMP Pro] - Software for burning in timecode and other items of metadata for DV AVI files.&lt;/ref&gt; is able to &quot;burn&quot; timecode or other items of DV metadata (such as date and time, iris, shutter speed, gain, white balance mode etc) into DV AVI files.

Some modern editing systems can use [[Optical character recognition|OCR]] techniques to read BITC in situations where other forms of timecode are not available.

BITC can also be referred to as Viz-Code.{{citation needed|date=October 2010}}

{{Quantum mechanics|cTopic=Background}}

'''Bra-ket notation''' is a standard notation for describing [[quantum state]]s in the theory of [[quantum mechanics]] composed of [[bracket|angle brackets]] and [[vertical bar]]s. It can also be used to denote abstract [[vector space|vectors]] and [[linear functional]]s in [[mathematics]]. It is so called because the [[inner product]] (or [[dot product]]) of two states is denoted by a '''bra'''c'''ket''', &lt;math&gt;\langle\phi|\psi\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, consisting of a left part, &lt;math&gt;\langle\phi|&lt;/math&gt;, called the '''bra''' ({{IPA-en|ˈbrɑː|pron}}), and a right part, &lt;math&gt;|\psi\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, called the '''ket''' ({{IPA-en|ˈkɛt|pron}}). The notation was introduced in 1930 by [[Paul Dirac]],&lt;ref name=Dirac&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; and is also known as '''Dirac notation'''.

Bra-ket notation is widespread in [[quantum mechanics]]: almost every phenomenon that is explained using quantum mechanics—including a large proportion of [[modern physics]]—is usually explained with the help of bra-ket notation. The expression &lt;math&gt;\langle\phi|\psi\rangle&lt;/math&gt; is typically interpreted as the [[probability amplitude]] for the state &lt;math&gt;\psi\!&lt;/math&gt; to [[wavefunction collapse|collapse]] into the state &lt;math&gt;\phi.\!&lt;/math&gt;

==Bras and kets==
=== Usage in quantum mechanics ===

In [[quantum mechanics]], the state of a [[physics|physical]] system is identified with a [[Line (geometry)#Ray|ray]] in a [[complex number|complex]] [[separable space|separable]] [[Hilbert space]], &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt;, or, equivalently, by a point in the [[projective Hilbert space]] of the system. Each [[vector space|vector]] in the ray is called a &quot;'''ket'''&quot; and written as &lt;math&gt;|\psi\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, which would be read as &quot;''ket [[psi (letter)|psi]]''&quot;. (The &lt;math&gt;\psi\!&lt;/math&gt; can be replaced by any symbols, letters, numbers, or even words—whatever serves as a convenient label for the ket.)
&lt;!-- // I think this is a generally accepted definition and doesn't need citing. ~~~ //

The '''ket''' can be viewed as a column vector and (given a basis for the Hilbert space) written out in coordinates,

:&lt;math&gt;|\psi\rangle = [ c_0 \; c_1 \; c_2 \; \dots ] ^T, &lt;/math&gt;

when the considered Hilbert space is finite-dimensional. In infinite-dimensional spaces there are infinitely many coordinates and the '''ket''' may be written in complex function notation, by prepending it with a '''bra''' (see below). For example,

:&lt;math&gt;\langle x|\psi\rangle = \psi(x) .&lt;/math&gt;

Every ket &lt;math&gt;|\psi\rangle&lt;/math&gt; has a [[dual vector|dual]] '''bra''', written as &lt;math&gt;\langle\psi|&lt;/math&gt;. For example, the bra corresponding to the '''ket''' &lt;math&gt;|\psi\rangle&lt;/math&gt; above would be the row vector

:&lt;math&gt;\langle\psi| = [c_0^* \; c_1^* \; c_2^* \; \dots] .&lt;/math&gt;

This is a continuous [[linear functional]] from &lt;math&gt;\mathcal H&lt;/math&gt; to the complex numbers &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt;, defined by:

:&lt;math&gt;\langle\psi| : \mathcal H \to \mathbb{C}: \langle \psi | \left( |\rho\rangle \right) = \operatorname{IP}\left( |\psi\rangle \;,\; |\rho\rangle \right),&lt;/math&gt;

for all kets &lt;math&gt;|\rho\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{IP}( \cdot , \cdot )&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[inner product]] defined on the [[Hilbert space]]. Here the origin of the bra-ket notation becomes clear: when we drop the parentheses (as is common with linear functionals) and meld the bars together we get &lt;math&gt;\langle\psi|\rho\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, which is common notation for an inner product in a Hilbert space. This combination of a bra with a ket to form a complex number is called a ''bra-ket'' or ''bracket''.

The bra is simply the [[conjugate transpose]] (also called the [[Hermitian conjugate]]) of the ket and vice versa. The notation is justified by the [[Riesz representation theorem]], which states that a Hilbert space and its [[dual space]] are isometrically conjugate isomorphic. Thus, each bra corresponds to exactly one ket, and vice versa. More precisely, if

:&lt;math&gt;J: \mathcal H \rightarrow \mathcal H^*&lt;/math&gt;

is the [[Riesz isomorphism]] between &lt;math&gt;\mathcal H&lt;/math&gt; and its dual space, then 

:&lt;math&gt;\forall \phi \in \mathcal H: \; \langle\phi| = J(|\phi\rangle).&lt;/math&gt;

Note that this only applies to states that are actually vectors in the Hilbert space. Non-[[normalisable wavefunction|normalizable]] states, such as those whose [[wavefunction]]s are [[Dirac delta function]]s or infinite [[plane wave]]s, do not technically belong to the Hilbert space. So if such a state is written as a ket, it will not have a corresponding bra according to the above definition. This problem can be dealt with in either of two ways. First, since all ''physical'' quantum states are normalizable, one can carefully avoid non-normalizable states. Alternatively, the underlying theory can be modified and generalized to accommodate such states, as in the [[Gelfand-Naimark-Segal construction]] or [[rigged Hilbert space]]s. In fact, physicists routinely use bra-ket notation for non-normalizable states, taking the second approach either implicitly or explicitly.

In quantum mechanics the expression &lt;math&gt;\langle\phi|\psi\rangle&lt;/math&gt; (mathematically: the coefficient for the projection of &lt;math&gt;\psi\!&lt;/math&gt; onto &lt;math&gt;\phi\!&lt;/math&gt;) is typically interpreted as the [[probability amplitude]] for the state &lt;math&gt;\psi\!&lt;/math&gt; to [[wavefunction collapse|collapse]] into the state &lt;math&gt;\phi.\!&lt;/math&gt;

The advantage of the bra-ket notation over explicit wave function algebra is the possibility of expressing operations on quantum states independent of a basis. For example the time-independent [[Schrödinger equation]] is simply expressed as

:&lt;math&gt;\hat H|\Psi\rangle=E |\Psi\rangle.&lt;/math&gt;

The operators can be conveniently expressed in different bases (see next section for the operations used in these formulas : action of a linear operator, outer product of a ket and a bra):

:&lt;math&gt;\hat p=\int \frac{\mathrm{d} p}{2\pi} |p\rangle p \langle p| = \int \mathrm{d} x |x\rangle (- \mathrm{i} \hbar \part_x) \langle x |&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\hat x=\int \mathrm{d} x |x\rangle x \langle x| = \int \frac{\mathrm{d} p}{2\pi} |p\rangle \left(+\mathrm{i}\hbar \part_p\right) \langle p |.&lt;/math&gt;

(For a rigorous definition of basis with a continuous set of indices and consequently for a rigorous definition of position and momentum basis see &lt;ref name=Carfi-Characterizations&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carfì|first=David|title=TOPOLOGICAL CHARACTERIZATIONS OF S-LINEARITY|journal=AAPP-PHYSICAL, MATHEMATICAL AND NATURAL SCIENCES|year=2007|volume=85|issue=2|pages=1–16|doi=10.1478/C1A0702005|url=http://cab.unime.it/journals/index.php/AAPP/article/view/407}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

(For a rigorous statement of the expansion of an S-diagonalizable operator - observable - in its eigenbasis or in another basis see &lt;ref name=Carfi-Glasnik&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carfì|first=David|title=S-DIAGONALIZABLE OPERATORS IN QUANTUM MECHANICS|journal=Glasnik Matematicki|year=2005|volume=40|issue=2|pages=261–301|doi=10.3336/gm.40.2.08|url=http://web.math.hr/glasnik/vol_40/no2_08.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;)
 
 
The wave functions in real, momentum or reciprocal space can be retrieved as needed:
:&lt;math&gt;\Psi(x)=\langle x | \Psi \rangle, \Psi_p=\langle p | \Psi \rangle, \Psi_k=\langle k | \Psi \rangle&lt;/math&gt;
and all basis conversions can be performed via the relations such as
:&lt;math&gt;\langle k|x \rangle = \mathrm{e}^{-\mathrm{i}kx}, \langle p|x \rangle = \mathrm{e}^{-\mathrm{i}\frac{p}{\hbar}x}&lt;/math&gt;

(for a rigorous treatment of the Dirac inner product of non-normalizable states see the definition given by D. Carfì in &lt;ref name=Carfi-Dirac&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carfì|first=David|title=Dirac-orthogonality in the space of tempered distributions|journal=Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics|year=2003|month=April|volume=153|issue=1-2|pages=99–107|doi=10.1016/S0377-0427(02)00634-9|url=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=774918|bibcode = 2003JCoAM.153...99C }}&lt;/ref&gt; and &lt;ref name=Carfi-Germanà&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carfì|first=David|title=Some properties of a new product in the space of tempered distributions|journal=Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics|year=2003|month=April|volume=153|issue=1-2|pages=109–118|doi=10.1016/S0377-0427(02)00635-0|url=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=774919|bibcode = 2003JCoAM.153..109C }}&lt;/ref&gt;)

=== More general uses ===

Bra-ket notation can be used even if the vector space is not a [[Hilbert space]]. In any [[Banach space]] ''B'', the vectors may be notated by kets and the continuous [[linear functional]]s by bras. Over any vector space without [[topology]], we may also notate the vectors by kets and the linear functionals by bras. In these more general contexts, the bracket does not have the meaning of an inner product, because the Riesz representation theorem does not apply.

==Linear operators==
If ''A'' : ''H'' → ''H'' is a [[linear operator]], we can apply ''A'' to the ket &lt;math&gt;|\psi\rangle&lt;/math&gt; to obtain the ket &lt;math&gt;(A|\psi\rangle)&lt;/math&gt;. Linear operators are ubiquitous in the theory of quantum mechanics. For example, observable physical quantities are represented by [[self-adjoint operator]]s, such as [[energy]] or [[momentum]], whereas transformative processes are represented by [[unitary operator|unitary]] linear operators such as rotation or the progression of time.

Operators can also be viewed as acting on bras ''from the right hand side''. Composing the bra &lt;math&gt;\langle\phi|&lt;/math&gt; with the operator ''A'' results in the bra &lt;math&gt;\bigg(\langle\phi|A\bigg)&lt;/math&gt;, defined as a linear functional on ''H'' by the rule

:&lt;math&gt;\bigg(\langle\phi|A\bigg) \; |\psi\rangle = \langle\phi| \; \bigg(A|\psi\rangle\bigg)&lt;/math&gt;.

This expression is commonly written as (cf. [[energy inner product]]) 

:&lt;math&gt;\langle\phi|A|\psi\rangle.&lt;/math&gt;

Note that the second symbol | is completely optional, i.e. &lt;math&gt;\langle\phi|A|\psi\rangle=\langle\phi|A\psi\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, since &lt;math&gt;A|\psi\rangle&lt;/math&gt; is in itself a ket and may be written &lt;math&gt;|A\psi\rangle&lt;/math&gt;.

If the same state vector appears on both bra and ket side, this expression gives the [[expectation value (quantum mechanics)|expectation value]], or mean or average value, of the observable represented by operator A for the physical system in the state &lt;math&gt;|\psi\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, written as

:&lt;math&gt;\langle\psi|A|\psi\rangle.&lt;/math&gt;

A convenient way to define linear operators on ''H'' is given by the [[outer product]]: if &lt;math&gt;\langle\phi|&lt;/math&gt; is a bra and &lt;math&gt;|\psi\rangle&lt;/math&gt; is a ket, the outer product

:&lt;math&gt; |\phi\rang \lang \psi| &lt;/math&gt;

denotes the [[finite rank operator|rank-one operator]] that maps the ket &lt;math&gt;|\rho\rangle&lt;/math&gt; to the ket &lt;math&gt;|\phi\rangle\langle\psi|\rho\rangle&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;\langle\psi|\rho\rangle&lt;/math&gt; is a scalar multiplying the vector &lt;math&gt;|\phi\rangle&lt;/math&gt;). One of the uses of the outer product is to construct [[projection operator]]s. Given a ket &lt;math&gt;|\psi\rangle&lt;/math&gt; of norm 1, the orthogonal projection onto the [[Linear subspace|subspace]] spanned by &lt;math&gt;|\psi\rangle&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt;|\psi\rangle\langle\psi|.&lt;/math&gt;

Just as kets and bras can be transformed into each other (making &lt;math&gt;|\psi\rangle&lt;/math&gt; into &lt;math&gt;\langle\psi|&lt;/math&gt;) the element from the dual space corresponding with &lt;math&gt;A|\psi\rangle&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\langle \psi | A^\dagger&lt;/math&gt; where ''A&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt;'' denotes the [[Hermitian conjugate]] of the operator ''A''.

It is usually taken as a [[postulate]] or [[axiom]] of [[quantum mechanics]], that any operator corresponding to an [[observable]] [[quantity]] (shortly called ''observable'') is self-adjoint, that is, it satisfies ''A&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt; = A''. Then the identity
:&lt;math&gt; \langle \psi | A | \psi \rangle^\star = \langle \psi |A^\dagger |\psi \rangle = \langle \psi | A | \psi \rangle &lt;/math&gt;
holds (for the first equality, use the scalar product's [[Inner product space|conjugate symmetry]] and the conversion rule from the 
preceding paragraph).
This implies that [[Expectation value (quantum mechanics)|expectation values]] of observables are real.

==Properties==
Bra-ket notation was designed to facilitate the formal manipulation of linear-algebraic expressions. Some of the properties that allow this manipulation are listed herein. In what follows, ''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''c''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; denote arbitrary [[complex number]]s, c* denotes the [[complex conjugate]] of c, ''A'' and ''B'' denote arbitrary linear operators, and these properties are to hold for any choice of bras and kets.

===Linearity===
* Since bras are linear functionals,

::&lt;math&gt;\langle\phi| \; \bigg( c_1|\psi_1\rangle + c_2|\psi_2\rangle \bigg) = c_1\langle\phi|\psi_1\rangle + c_2\langle\phi|\psi_2\rangle. &lt;/math&gt;

* By the definition of addition and scalar multiplication of linear functionals in the [[dual space]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://bohr.physics.berkeley.edu/classes/221/0708/notes/hilbert.pdf Lecture notes by Robert Littlejohn], eqns 12 and 13&lt;/ref&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\bigg(c_1 \langle\phi_1| + c_2 \langle\phi_2|\bigg) \; |\psi\rangle = c_1 \langle\phi_1|\psi\rangle + c_2 \langle\phi_2|\psi\rangle. &lt;/math&gt;

===Associativity===
Given any expression involving complex numbers, bras, kets, inner products, outer products, and/or linear operators (but not addition), written in bra-ket notation, the parenthetical groupings do not matter (i.e., the [[associative property]] holds). For example:
::&lt;math&gt; \lang \psi| (A |\phi\rang) = (\lang \psi|A)|\phi\rang&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt; (A|\psi\rang)\lang \phi| = A(|\psi\rang \lang \phi|)&lt;/math&gt;
and so forth. The expressions can thus be written, unambiguously, with no parentheses whatsoever. Note that the associative property does ''not'' hold for expressions that include non-linear operators, such as the [[antilinear]] [[T-symmetry|time reversal operator]] in physics.

===Hermitian conjugation===
Bra-ket notation makes it particularly easy to compute the Hermitian conjugate (also called ''dagger'', and denoted †) of expressions. The formal rules are:
* The Hermitian conjugate of a bra is the corresponding ket, and vice-versa.
* The Hermitian conjugate of a complex number is its complex conjugate.
* The Hermitian conjugate of the Hermitian conjugate of anything (linear operators, bras, kets, numbers) is itself—i.e.,
::&lt;math&gt;(x^\dagger)^\dagger=x&lt;/math&gt;.
* Given any combination of complex numbers, bras, kets, inner products, outer products, and/or linear operators, written in bra-ket notation, its Hermitian conjugate can be computed by reversing the order of the components, and taking the Hermitian conjugate of each.

These rules are sufficient to formally write the Hermitian conjugate of any such expression; some examples are as follows:
* Kets:
::&lt;math&gt;
\left(c_1|\psi_1\rangle + c_2|\psi_2\rangle\right)^\dagger = c_1^* \langle\psi_1| + c_2^* \langle\psi_2|.
&lt;/math&gt;
* Inner products:
::&lt;math&gt;\lang \phi | \psi \rang^* = \lang \psi|\phi\rang&lt;/math&gt;
* Matrix elements:
::&lt;math&gt;\lang \phi| A | \psi \rang^* = \lang \psi | A^\dagger |\phi \rang&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\lang \phi| A^\dagger B^\dagger | \psi \rang^* = \lang \psi | BA |\phi \rang&lt;/math&gt;
* Outer products:
::&lt;math&gt;\left((c_1|\phi_1\rang\lang \psi_1|) + (c_2|\phi_2\rang\lang\psi_2|)\right)^\dagger = (c_1^* |\psi_1\rang\lang \phi_1|) + (c_2^*|\psi_2\rang\lang\phi_2|)&lt;/math&gt;

==Composite bras and kets==
Two Hilbert spaces ''V'' and ''W'' may form a third space &lt;math&gt;V \otimes W&lt;/math&gt; by a [[tensor product]]. In quantum mechanics, this is used for describing composite systems. If a system is composed of two subsystems described in ''V'' and ''W'' respectively, then the Hilbert space of the entire system is the tensor product of the two spaces. (The exception to this is if the subsystems are actually [[identical particles]]. In that case, the situation is a little more complicated.)

If &lt;math&gt;|\psi\rangle&lt;/math&gt; is a ket in V and &lt;math&gt;|\phi\rangle&lt;/math&gt; is a ket in W, the direct product of the two kets is a ket in &lt;math&gt;V \otimes W&lt;/math&gt;. This is written variously as

:&lt;math&gt;|\psi\rangle|\phi\rangle&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;|\psi\rangle \otimes |\phi\rangle&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;|\psi \phi\rangle&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;|\psi ,\phi\rangle.&lt;/math&gt;

==Representations in terms of bras and kets==
In quantum mechanics, it is often convenient to work with the projections of state vectors onto a particular basis, rather than the vectors themselves. The reason is that the former are simply [[complex number]]s, and can be formulated in terms of [[partial differential equation]]s (see, for example, the derivation of the position-basis [[Schrödinger equation]]). This process is very similar to the use of [[coordinates vector|coordinate vectors]] in [[linear algebra]].

For instance, the Hilbert space of a zero-[[spin (physics)|spin]] point particle is spanned by a position basis &lt;math&gt;\lbrace|\mathbf{x}\rangle\rbrace&lt;/math&gt;, where the label '''x''' extends over the set of position vectors.  Starting from any ket &lt;math&gt;|\psi\rangle&lt;/math&gt; in this Hilbert space, we can ''define'' a complex scalar function of '''x''', known as a [[wavefunction]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\psi(\mathbf{x}) \ \stackrel{\text{def}}{=}\ \lang \mathbf{x}|\psi\rang.&lt;/math&gt;

It is then customary to define linear operators acting on wavefunctions in terms of linear operators acting on kets, by

:&lt;math&gt;A \psi(\mathbf{x}) \ \stackrel{\text{def}}{=}\  \lang \mathbf{x}|A|\psi\rang.&lt;/math&gt;

For instance, the [[momentum]] operator '''p''' has the following form:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p} \psi(\mathbf{x}) \ \stackrel{\text{def}}{=}\  \lang \mathbf{x} |\mathbf{p}|\psi\rang = - i \hbar \nabla \psi(\mathbf{x}).&lt;/math&gt;

One occasionally encounters an expression like

:&lt;math&gt; - i \hbar \nabla |\psi\rang.&lt;/math&gt;

This is something of an [[abuse of notation]], though a fairly common one. The differential operator must be understood to be an abstract operator, acting on kets, that has the effect of differentiating wavefunctions once the expression is projected into the position basis:

:&lt;math&gt; - i \hbar \nabla \lang\mathbf{x}|\psi\rang.&lt;/math&gt;

''For further details, see [[rigged Hilbert space]].''

==The unit operator==
Consider a complete [[orthonormal]] system (''[[Basis (linear algebra)|basis]]''), &lt;math&gt;\{ e_i \  | \  i \in \mathbb{N} \}&lt;/math&gt;, for a Hilbert space ''H'', with respect to the norm from an inner product &lt;math&gt;\langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle&lt;/math&gt;. From basic [[functional analysis]] we know that any ket &lt;math&gt;|\psi\rangle&lt;/math&gt; can be written as 
:&lt;math&gt;|\psi\rangle = \sum_{i \in \mathbb{N}} \langle e_i | \psi \rangle | e_i \rangle,&lt;/math&gt;
with &lt;math&gt;\langle\cdot|\cdot\rangle&lt;/math&gt; the inner product on the Hilbert space. From the commutativity of kets with (complex) scalars now follows that
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i \in \mathbb{N}} | e_i \rangle \langle e_i | = \hat{1}&lt;/math&gt;
must be the unit operator, which sends each vector to itself. This can be inserted in any expression without affecting its value, for example
:&lt;math&gt; \langle v | w \rangle = \langle v | \sum_{i \in \mathbb{N}} | e_i \rangle \langle e_i | w \rangle = \langle v | \sum_{i \in \mathbb{N}} | e_i \rangle \langle e_i | \sum_{j \in \mathbb{N}} | e_j \rangle \langle e_j | w \rangle = \langle v | e_i \rangle \langle e_i | e_j \rangle \langle e_j | w \rangle &lt;/math&gt;
where in the last identity [[Einstein summation convention]] has been used.

In [[quantum mechanics]] it often occurs that little or no information about the inner product &lt;math&gt;\langle\psi|\phi\rangle&lt;/math&gt; of two arbitrary (state) kets is present, while it is possible to say something about the expansion coefficients &lt;math&gt;\langle\psi|e_i\rangle = \langle e_i|\psi\rangle^*&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\langle e_i|\phi\rangle&lt;/math&gt; of those vectors with respect to a chosen (orthonormalized) basis. In this case it is particularly useful to insert the unit operator into the bracket one time or more (for more information see [[Resolution of the identity]]).

== Notation used by mathematicians ==

The object physicists are considering when using the &quot;bra-ket&quot; notation is a [[Hilbert space]] (a [[Complete metric space|complete]] [[inner product space]]). 

Let &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{H} &lt;/math&gt; be a Hilbert space and &lt;math&gt; h\in\mathcal{H} &lt;/math&gt; is a vector in &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{H} &lt;/math&gt;. What physicists would denote as &lt;math&gt; |h\rangle &lt;/math&gt; is the vector itself. That is 

::&lt;math&gt; (|h\rangle)\in \mathcal{H} &lt;/math&gt;.

Let &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{H}^* &lt;/math&gt; be the dual space of &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{H} &lt;/math&gt;. This is the space of linear functionals on &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt;. The isomorphism &lt;math&gt; \Phi:\mathcal{H}\to\mathcal{H}^* &lt;/math&gt; is defined by &lt;math&gt; \Phi(h) = \phi_h &lt;/math&gt; where for all &lt;math&gt; g\in\mathcal{H} &lt;/math&gt; we have 
::&lt;math&gt; \phi_h(g) = \mbox{IP}(h,g) = (h,g) = \langle h,g \rangle  = \langle h|g \rangle &lt;/math&gt;,
Where 
:: &lt;math&gt; \mbox{IP}(\cdot,\cdot), (\cdot,\cdot),\langle \cdot,\cdot \rangle, \langle \cdot | \cdot \rangle &lt;/math&gt;
are just different notations for expressing an inner product between two elements in a Hilbert space (or for the first three, in ''any'' inner product space). Notational confusion arises when identifying &lt;math&gt; \phi_h &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; g &lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt; \langle h | &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;|g \rangle &lt;/math&gt; respectively. This is because of literal symbolic substitutions. Let &lt;math&gt; \phi_h = H = \langle h| &lt;/math&gt; and let &lt;math&gt; g=G=|g\rangle &lt;/math&gt;. This gives

::&lt;math&gt; \phi_h(g) = H(g) = H(G)=\langle h|(G) = \langle h|(
|g\rangle). &lt;/math&gt;

One ignores the parentheses and removes the double bars. Some properties of this notation are convenient since we are dealing with linear operators and composition acts like a [[Ring (mathematics)|ring]] multiplication.

The [[English language]] commonly uses &quot;blue&quot; to refer to any colour from [[navy blue]] to [[cyan]]. The word itself is derived from the [[Old French]] word ''bleu''.

==Etymology and definitions==

The [[modern English]] word ''blue'' comes from [[Middle English]] ''bleu'' or ''blewe'', from [[Old French]] ''bleu'', ''bleve'', ''blöe'', a word of [[Germanic language|Germanic]] origin ([[Old Frankish|Frankish]] or possibly [[Old High German]] ''blāo'', &quot;blue&quot;). ''Bleu'' replaced Old English ''blāw'' &quot;blue&quot; and ''blǣwen'' &quot;light blue&quot;. The root of all these variations is Proto-Germanic ''blǣwaz'', from Proto-Indo-European *''bhlāw-, *bhlēw-'' &quot;light-coloured, yellow, grey, blue&quot;, from *''bhel-'' &quot;to shine, be light or bright&quot;, also the root of [[Old Norse]] ''blār'' and the modern [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] ''blár'', and the [[North Germanic languages|Scandinavian]] word ''blå'', which can also refer to other non blue colours. &lt;!-- It can also be green or orange occasionally (blue). --&gt; A [[Scots language|Scots]] and [[Scottish English]] word for &quot;blue-grey&quot; is ''blae'', from the Middle English ''bla'' (&quot;dark blue&quot;, from [[Old Norse]] ''blār''). Also related is the English word ''blee'' meaning &quot;colour, complexion&quot;. Ancient Greek lacked a word for blue and [[Homer]] called the colour of the sea &quot;wine dark&quot;, except that the word ''kyanos'' (cyan) was used for dark blue enamel.
As a curiosity, ''blue'' is thought to be cognate with ''[[black]]'', ''[[blond]]'', and [[bleach]], in the sense of ''[[wikt:blank|blank]]'', and through the Germanic word. Through a [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] root, it is also linked with Latin ''flavus'' (&quot;yellow&quot;; see ''[[flavescent]]'' and ''[[flavine]]''), with Greek ''phalos'' (white), French ''blanc'' (white, blank) (borrowed from [[Old Frankish language|Old Frankish]]), and with Russian белый, ''belyi'' (&quot;white,&quot; see ''[[Beluga (whale)|beluga]]''), and Welsh ''blawr'' (grey) all of which derive (according to the ''[[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language|American Heritage Dictionary]]'') from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] [[Root (linguistics)|root]] ''*bhel-'' meaning &quot;to shine, flash or burn&quot;, (more specifically the word bhle-was, which meant light coloured, blue, blond, or yellow), whence came the names of various bright colours, and that of colour black from a derivation meaning &quot;burnt&quot; (other words derived from the root ''*bhel-'' include ''bleach, ''bleak'', ''blind'', ''blink'', ''blank'', ''blush'', ''blaze'', ''flame'', ''fulminate'', ''flagrant'' and ''phlegm'').

In the English language, blue may refer to the feeling of sadness. &quot;He was feeling blue&quot;. This is because blue was related to rain, or storms, and in Greek mythology, the god [[Zeus]] would make rain when he was sad (crying), and a storm when he was angry. ''Kyanos'' was a name used in [[Ancient Greek]] to refer to ''dark blue tile'' (in English it means blue-green or [[cyan]]).&lt;ref&gt;''Merriam-Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary'' Springfield, Mass.:1984--Merriam-Webster Page 319&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase &quot;feeling blue&quot; is linked also to a custom among many old deepwater sailing ships. If the ship lost the captain or any of the officers during its voyage, she would fly blue flags and have a blue band painted along her entire hull when returning to home port.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.navy.mil/navydata/traditions/html/navyterm.html#feelblue  &quot;US Navy - origins of Navy Terminology&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many languages do not have [[Distinguishing blue from green in language|separate terms for blue and or green]], instead using a cover term for both (when the issue is discussed in linguistics, this cover term is sometimes called ''[[Grue and bleen|grue]]'' in English).

==In science==
===Pigments and dyes===
Traditionally, blue has been considered a primary colour in painting, with the secondary colour [[orange (colour)|orange]] as its complement.

Blue pigments include [[azurite]] ({{chem|Cu|3|(CO|3|)|2|(OH)|2|)}}, [[ultramarine]] ({{chem|Na&lt;sub&gt;8-10&lt;/sub&gt;||Al|6|Si|6|O|24|S&lt;sub&gt;2-4&lt;/sub&gt;}}), [[cerulean blue]] (primarily cobalt (II) stanate: {{chem|Co|2|SnO|4}}), [[cobalt blue]] (cobalt(II) aluminate: {{chem|CoAl|2|O|4}}), and [[Prussian blue]] (milori blue: primarily {{chem|Fe|7|(CN)|18}}).

Traditionally [[natural dyes]] such as [[woad]] and [[Indigofera tinctoria|true indigo]] were used to produce [[indigo dye]] used to colour fabrics blue or [[indigo]]. These have now largely been replaced by synthetic [[dyes]].

===Scientific natural standards for blue===
* Emission spectrum of {{chem|link=Copper|Cu|2+}}
* Electronic spectrum of aqua-ions {{chem|Cu(H|2|O)|6|2+}}

===Animals===

[[File:Cyanocitta cristata blue jay.jpg|left|thumb|alt=A blue and white bird, with a crest on its head.|[[Blue Jay]]]]
*When an animal's coat is described as &quot;blue&quot;, it usually refers to a shade of grey that takes on a bluish tint, a diluted variant of a pure black coat.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} This designation is used for a variety of animals, including [[coat (dog)|dog coats]], some rat coats, [[cat coat genetics|cat coats]], some chicken breeds, some [[equine coat color|horse coat colours]] and rabbit coat colours. Some animals, such as giraffes and lizards, also have blue tongues.

==In culture==
===Symbolic language===
* In the English language, blue often represents the human emotion of sadness, for example, &quot;He was feeling blue&quot;. In German, on the other hand, to be &quot;blue&quot; (''blau sein'') is to be drunk. This derives from the ancient use of urine (which is produced copiously by the human body after drinking alcohol) in dyeing cloth blue with woad or indigo.&lt;ref&gt;Heller, Eva.  ''Wie Farben wirken: Farbpsychologie, Farbsymbolik, kreative Farbgestaltung''.  Berlin: Rowohlt, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; It may also be in relation to rain, which is usually regarded as a trigger of depressive emotions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theweatherprediction.com/habyhints2/469/ Top 10 weather complaints]&lt;/ref&gt;

*Conversely blue, a very popular colour&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.joehallock.com/edu/COM498/preferences.html Preferences - Favorite Color]&lt;/ref&gt; can represent happiness and optimism&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.precisionintermedia.com/color.html Psychology of Color]&lt;/ref&gt; as days with clearer, blue skies tend to be considered times where these emotions are more easily expressed. Many artistic contributions have been made referencing clear days with blue skies as part of the happiness or as a symbolism of the happiness the artist felt, such as [[Tony Bennett]]'s Put on a Happy Face.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stlyrics.com/lyrics/byebyebirdie/putonahappyface.htm &quot;Put on a Happy Face&quot; lyrics]&lt;/ref&gt; If this were untrue there would obviously be more complaints about days with clear blue skies.

*Blue is commonly used in the Western hemisphere to symbolize the male gender in contrast to [[pink]] used for females, although in the early 1900s, blue was the colour for girls (as it had traditionally been the colour of the [[Virgin Mary]] in [[Western Art]]) and pink was for boys (as it was akin to the colour [[red]], considered a masculine colour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Should we not dress girls in pink?|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/7817496.stm|work=BBC Magazine|publisher=BBC|accessdate=28 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The [[Blue House]] is the residence of the [[President of South Korea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite |url = http://english.president.go.kr/tours/place_buildings/main_office.php | title = Cheong Wa Dae / The Blue House | quote = The Main Building and its two annexes are covered with a total of 150,000 traditional Korean blue roof tiles (hence, the name &quot;Blue House&quot; is also commonly used when referring to Cheongwadae). }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Blue has been associated with a variety of political positions, often differentiated from [[Communism|communist]] red or [[anarchism|anarchist]] black. During the [[War in the Vendée|revolt in the Vendée]] against the [[French Revolution]], blues stood for the revolutionary forces, and white for the counter-revolutionaries. Later movements like the [[Breton blues]] used the colour to signify allegiance to the ideals of the revolution.
* The [[blueshirts]] was a quasi-[[fascist]] political organisation active in Ireland during the 1930s (the name comes from the fact that [[St. Patrick's Blue]] is one of the traditional colours of Ireland).
* Blue is the colour of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] in Britain and [[Conservative Party of Canada]]. Television coverage in the United States since the 2000 presidential election has made it fashionable to link the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] to &quot;blue&quot; and the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] to &quot;red&quot; (especially in reference to &quot;[[red states and blue states]]&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brooks|first=David|title=One Nation, Slightly Divisible |url=http://www.theatlantic.com/past/docs/issues/2001/12/brooks.htm|work=The Atlantic Monthly |accessdate=2 November 2010| date=December 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Brazil, blue states are the ones in which the [[Brazilian Social Democratic Party|Social Democratic Party]] has the majority, in opposition to the [[Workers' Party (Brazil)|Workers' Party]], usually represented by red.

* A [[blue law]] is a type of law, typically found in the United States and Canada, designed to enforce religious standards, particularly the observance of Sunday as a day of worship or rest, and a restriction on Sunday shopping. The word ''blue'' was used in the 17th century as a disparaging reference to rigid moral codes and those who observed them, particularly in ''blue-stocking'', a reference to Oliver Cromwell's supporters in the parliament of 1653.
* Blue is associated with numerous [[centre-right]] [[liberalism|liberal]] political parties in [[Europe]], Including the [[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]] (Netherlands), the [[Mouvement Réformateur|Reformist Movement]] and [[Open Vlaamse Liberalen en Democraten|Open VLD]] (Belgium), the [[Democratic Party (Luxembourg)|Democratic Party]] (Luxembourg), [[Venstre (Denmark)|Liberal Party]] (Denmark) and [[Liberal People's Party (Sweden)|Liberal People's Party]] (Sweden).

===Religion===
* Blue is associated in Christianity generally and Catholicism in particular, with the [[Virgin Mary]].{{fact|date=May 2011}}
* Blue in Hinduism: Many of the gods are depicted as having blue-coloured skin, particularly those associated with [[Vishnu]], who is said to be the Preserver of the world and thus intimately connected to water. [[Krishna]] and [[Rama|Ram]], Vishnu's avatars, are usually blue. [[Shiva]], the Destroyer, is also depicted in light blue tones and is called ''neela kantha'', or blue-throated, for having swallowed poison in an attempt to turn the tide of a battle between the gods and demons in the gods' favour.
* [[Blue in Judaism]]: In the [[Torah]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] 15:38.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Israelites]] were commanded to put fringes, ''[[tzitzit]]'', on the corners of their garments, and to weave within these fringes a &quot;twisted thread of blue (''tekhelet'')&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tekhelet.com Tekhelet.com], the Ptil Tekhelet Organization&lt;/ref&gt; In ancient days, this blue thread was made from a dye extracted from a Mediterranean snail called the ''hilazon''. [[Maimonides]] claimed that this blue was the colour of &quot;the clear noonday sky&quot;; [[Rashi]], the colour of the evening sky.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Mishneh Torah]]'', ''Tzitzit'' 2:1; Commentary on Numbers 15:38.&lt;/ref&gt; According to several rabbinic sages, blue is the colour of God's Glory.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Numbers Rabbah]]'' 14:3; ''[[Hullin]]'' 89a.&lt;/ref&gt; Staring at this colour aids in mediation, bringing us a glimpse of the &quot;pavement of sapphire, like the very sky for purity&quot;, which is a likeness of the Throne of God.&lt;ref&gt;[[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 24:10; [[Ezekiel]] 1:26; ''[[Hullin]]'' 89a.&lt;/ref&gt; (The [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word for glory.) Many items in the ''[[Mishkan]]'', the portable sanctuary in the wilderness, such as the ''[[Menorah (Temple)|menorah]]'', many of the vessels, and the [[Ark of the Covenant]], were covered with blue cloth when transported from place to place.&lt;ref&gt;[[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] 4:6-12.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Blue in [[Islam]]: In verse [[Ta-Ha|20]]:102 of the [[Qur’an]], the word زرق ''zurq'' (plural of ''azraq'' 'blue') is used metaphorically for evildoers whose eyes are glazed with fear, as if the [[sclera]] is filmed over with a bluish tint.

===Symbolism===
* In Thailand, blue is associated with Friday on the [[Thai solar calendar]]. Anyone may wear blue on Fridays and anyone born on a Friday may adopt blue as their colour. The [[Thai language]], however, is one that has had trouble distinguishing blue from green. The default word for Blue was recently สีน้ำเงิน literally, the colour of silver, a poetical reference to the silvery sheen of the deep blue sea. It now means navy blue, and the default word is now สีฟ้า literally, the colour of the sky.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Blind Willie McTell''' (May 5, 1898 – August 19, 1959) was an influential [[African-American]] [[blues]] [[musician]] and [[songwriter]] who sang and accompanied himself on the guitar. He was a [[12-string guitar|twelve-string]] [[fingerstyle|finger picking]] [[Piedmont blues|Piedmont]] and [[country blues]] guitarist who recorded 149 songs between 1927 and 1956.

==Biography==
Born '''William Samuel McTier''' (or McTear)&lt;ref&gt;http://toto.lib.unca.edu/sounds/piedmontblues/mctell.html University of North Carolina&lt;/ref&gt;) in [[Thomson, Georgia|Thomson]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[blindness|blind]] in one eye, McTell had lost his remaining vision by late childhood but became an adept reader of [[Braille]]. He showed proficiency in music from an early age and learned to play the six-string guitar as soon as he could. His father left the family when McTell was still young, and when his mother died in the 1920s, he left his hometown and became a wandering [[busking|busker]]. He began his recording career in 1927 for [[Victor Records]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]].&lt;ref name=green&gt;Justin Green - Musical Legends (ISBN 0-86719-587-8)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years before [[World War II]], he traveled and performed widely, recording for a number of labels under many different names, including Blind Willie McTell (Victor and Decca), Blind Sammie (Columbia), Georgia Bill (Okeh), Hot Shot Willie (Victor), Blind Willie (Vocalion and Bluebird), Barrelhouse Sammie (Atlantic), and Pig &amp; Whistle Red (Regal).The &quot;Pig 'n Whistle&quot; appellation was a reference to a chain of Atlanta Bar-B-Que restaurants, one of which was located on the south side of East Ponce de Leon between Boulevard and Moreland Avenue. Blind Willie frequently played for tips in the parking lot of this location, which later became the Krispy Kreme. He was also known to play behind the nearby building that later became Ray Lee's Blue Lantern Lounge. His style was singular: a form of country blues bridging the gap between the raw blues of the early part of the 20th century and the more refined east coast &quot;Piedmont&quot; sound. He took on the less common and more unwieldy 12-string guitar because of its loudness. The style is well documented on [[John Lomax]]'s 1940 recordings of McTell for the [[Library of Congress]], for which McTell earned ten dollars (the modern equivalent of [http://www.dollartimes.com/calculators/inflation.htm $154.25]).&lt;ref name=green /&gt;

McTell is unusual, if not unique, among country bluesmen for his ability to play the guitar in both a complex, fingerpicking ragtime style similar to [[Blind Blake]] or [[Blind Boy Fuller]] (see, for example, his recording of &quot;Georgia Rag,&quot; a cover of Blake's &quot;Wabash Rag&quot;) and a heavier bottleneck blues style (&quot;Three Women Blues&quot;). His playing in both idioms is masterly, fluid, and inventive; based on multiple recordings of the same song (for example, &quot;Broke Down Engine&quot;), he never played a song the same way twice. His style could almost be called &quot;stream of consciousness,&quot; as he would vary the bar pattern and sometimes even the rhythm and chord progression from verse to verse. McTell was also an excellent accompanist and recorded many songs with his longtime musical companion, [[Curley Weaver]]; their recordings are some of the most outstanding examples of country blues guitar duets. See, for example, &quot;It's a Good Little Thing&quot; or &quot;You Were Born to Die.&quot;

In 1934, he married Ruthy Kate Williams (now better known as [[Kate McTell]]).&lt;ref&gt;http://bluesnet.hub.org/readings/mctell.html&lt;/ref&gt; She accompanied him on stage and on several recordings before becoming a nurse in 1939. Most of their marriage from 1942 until his death was spent apart, with her living in [[Fort Gordon]] near Augusta and him working around Atlanta.

Postwar, he recorded for [[Atlantic Records]] and [[Regal Records (1946)|Regal Records]] in 1949, but these recordings met with less commercial success than his previous works. He continued to perform around Atlanta, but his career was cut short by ill health, predominantly [[diabetes]] and alcoholism.

In 1956, an Atlanta record store manager, Edward Rhodes, discovered McTell playing in the street for quarters and enticed him with a bottle of corn liquor into his store, where he captured a few final performances on a tape recorder. These were released posthumously on Prestige/[[Bluesville Records]] as Last Session.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=2006-11-17
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McTell died in [[Milledgeville, Georgia]], of a [[stroke]] in 1959. He was buried at Jones Grove Church, near Thomson, Georgia, his birthplace. A fan paid to have a gravestone erected on his resting place.

He was inducted into the [[Blues Foundation]]'s [[Blues Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blues.org/halloffame/inductees.php4?YearId=24 Blues Foundation :: Inductees]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==

[[File:StatesboroBlues.jpg|thumb|right]]
One of McTell's most famous songs, &quot;[[Statesboro Blues]],&quot; was frequently covered by [[The Allman Brothers Band]] and is considered one of their earliest signature songs{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}. A short list of some of the artists who also perform it includes [[Taj Mahal (musician)|Taj Mahal]], [[David Bromberg]], and [[Ralph McTell]], who changed his name on account of liking the song.&lt;ref&gt;Hockenhull, Chris. &quot;Streets of London: The Official Biography of Ralph McTell&quot;, p. 40. Northdown, 1997. ISBN 1-900711-02-8.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jack White (musician)|Jack White]] of [[The White Stripes]] considers McTell an influence, as their 2000 album ''[[De Stijl (album)|De Stijl]]'' was dedicated to him and featured a cover of his song &quot;Southern Can Mama&quot;. The White Stipes also covered McTell's &quot;[[Lord, Send Me an Angel]]&quot;, releasing it as a single in 2000.

[[Bob Dylan]] has paid tribute to McTell on at least four occasions: Firstly, in his 1965 song &quot;[[Highway 61 Revisited]]&quot;, the second verse begins with &quot;Georgia Sam he had a bloody nose&quot;, referring to one of Blind Willie McTell's many recording names; later in his song &quot;[[Blind Willie McTell (song)|Blind Willie McTell]]&quot;, recorded in 1983 but released in 1991 on ''[[The Bootleg Series Volumes 1-3]]''; then with covers of McTell's &quot;Broke Down Engine&quot; and &quot;Delia&quot; on his 1993 album, ''[[World Gone Wrong]]''.&lt;ref&gt;In his sleeve notes for ''World Gone Wrong'', Dylan wrote: &quot;'Broke Down Engine' is a Blind Willie McTell masterpiece... it's about Ambiguity, the fortunes of the privileged elite, flood control — watching the red dawn not bothering to dress.(sic)'&lt;/ref&gt;; also, in his song &quot;Po'Boy&quot;, on 2001's ''[[&quot;Love &amp; Theft&quot;]]'', which contains the lyric, &quot;had to go to Florida dodging them Georgia laws&quot;, which comes from McTell's &quot;Kill It Kid&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Kill it Kid, Last Session, Bluesville BV 1040, Released 1962&lt;/ref&gt;

A blues bar in Atlanta is named after him and regularly features blues musicians and bands{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}. A blues festival in McTell's honor is held annually in his birthplace, Thomson, Georgia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blindwilliesblues.com/ Blindwillieblues.com]&lt;/ref&gt; A new stage production about Blind Willie McTell will premier at the Averritt Arts Center in Willie's hometown of Statesboro, Georgia, in the summer of 2011. The show is entitled &quot;Blind Willie: The Musical&quot;{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}.

'''BDSM''' is a continuum of erotic practice and expression involving the consensual use of restraint, intense sensory stimulation, and fantasy [[role-play]]. The compound [[acronym]], BDSM, is derived from the terms [[Bondage (BDSM)|bondage]] and [[Discipline (BDSM)|discipline]] (B&amp;D or B/D), [[dominance and submission]] (D&amp;S or D/s), and [[Sadomasochism|sadism and masochism]] (S&amp;M or S/M). BDSM includes a wide spectrum of activities, forms of [[interpersonal relationship]]s, and distinct [[subculture]]s.

Activities and relationships within a BDSM context are characterized by the fact that the participants usually take on complementary, but unequal roles, thus the idea of consent of both the partners becomes essential. Typically participants who are active – applying the activity or exercising control over others – are known as [[Top (BDSM)|tops or dominants]]. Those participants who are recipients of the activities, or who are controlled by their partners are typically known as [[Bottom (BDSM)|bottoms or submissives]]. Individuals who assume either top/dominant or bottom/submissive roles — whether from relationship to relationship or within a given relationship — are known as [[Switch (BDSM)|switches]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Terms&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Grau|first=Johnson|url=http://www.leathernroses.com/generalbdsm/ssbbfaqdefines.htm|title=What do B&amp;D, S&amp;M, D&amp;S, &quot;top&quot;, &quot;bottom&quot; mean|publisher=Leather Roses|date=1995,`1997|accessdate=2008-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fundamentals ==
[[File:Mairne in the Basement Bondage.jpg|thumb|A woman is chained to the wall in bondage.]]

The term BDSM has become a broad term for eroticized behavior between consenting adults. There is little that unites all the disparate [[subculture]]s which are grouped under the umbrella term BDSM. Interpersonal relationships which are based on the [[Convention (norm)|social conventions]] of one of the BDSM subcultures, exist in marked contrast with the current [[Western world|Western]] ideal of such relationships being based on a partnership between equals.

While the terminology for roles varies widely within the various BDSM subcultures, [[Top (BDSM)|Top]] and [[Top (BDSM)|Dominant]] are widely recognized terms for those partner(s) in the relationship or activity which are respectively the physically active or controlling participants, and [[Bottom (BDSM)|Bottom]] and [[Bottom (BDSM)|Submissive]] are widely recognized terms for those partner(s) in the relationship or activity which are respectively the physically receptive or controlled participants. The interaction between Tops and Bottoms, where physical and/or mental control of the Bottom is surrendered to the Top – whether in the context of a short term encounter typically referred to as a [[Scene (BDSM)|scene]], or in the context of a longer-term relationship – is sometime known as [[Power exchange (BDSM)|power exchange]].

BDSM actions can often take place during a specific period of time agreed to by both parties, referred to as &quot;play&quot;, &quot;a scene&quot; or &quot;a session&quot;. Parties involved usually derive pleasure from this, even though many of the practices that are performed, such as inflicting pain, [[humiliation]] or being restrained would be considered unpleasant under normal circumstances. [[Sexual intercourse]], be it [[Oral sex|oral]], [[Anal Sex|anal]] or [[Vaginal sex|vaginal]], may occur within a session, but is not essential.&lt;ref&gt;Phillip Miller, Molly Devon, William A. Granzig : ''Screw the Roses, Send Me the Thorns: The Romance and Sexual Sorcery of Sadomasochism.'', page 55, Mystic Rose Books 1995, ISBN 978-0-9645960-0-9&lt;/ref&gt; Such explicit sexual interaction is seen only extremely rarely in public play spaces, and is often a violation of the standing rules in most spaces.

The fundamental principles for the exercise of BDSM require that it should be performed by responsible partners, of their own volition, and in a safe way. Since the 1980s these basic principles have been condensed into the motto &quot;Safe, sane and consensual&quot;, abbreviated as SSC, which means that everything is based on safe, sane and consenting behavior of all involved parties.&lt;ref&gt;Bill Henkin, Sybil Holiday: Consensual Sadomasochism : How to Talk About It and How to Do It Safely, Page 64, Publisher: Daedalus Publishing Company 2006, ISBN 978-1-881943-12-9&lt;/ref&gt; This mutual consent makes a clear legal and ethical distinction between BDSM and crimes such as sexual assault or [[domestic violence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://sexsupport.org/abusevsere.html|title = VICSS / Difference between Abuse and Power Exchange by the NLA, Dutch SM Media Information Center and Powerrotics|accessdate = 2007-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some BDSM practitioners prefer a code of behavior that differs from &quot;SSC&quot; and described as &quot;Risk Aware Consensual Kink&quot; (RACK), indicating a preference of a style in which the ''individual'' responsibility of the involved parties is emphasized more strongly, with each participant being responsible for his or her own well-being. RACK focuses primarily upon awareness and informed consent, rather than accepted safe practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.withinreality.com/rackssc.html|title = Rack vs. SSC|accessdate = 2006-11-13|year = 2003|work = Within Reality}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Informed consent#Sex|Consent]] is the most important criterion here. The consent and compliance for a sadomasochistic situation can be granted only by people who are able to judge the potential results. For their consent, they must have relevant information (extent to which the scene will go, potential risks, if a safeword will be used, what that is, and so on.) at hand and the necessary mental capacity to judge. The resulting consent and understanding can often be summarized in a written &quot;[[Contract (BDSM)|contract]]&quot;; an agreement of what can and cannot take place.&lt;ref&gt;Dossie Easton, Janet W. Hardy: The New Topping Book, Greenery Press (CA) 2002, ISBN 978-1-890159-36-8&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, it must be possible for the consenting partner to withdraw his or her consent;&lt;ref&gt;Dossie Easton, Janet W. Hardy: The New Topping Book. Page 72, Greenery Press (CA) 2002, ISBN 978-1-890159-36-8&lt;/ref&gt; for example, by using a [[safeword]] that was agreed on in advance.&lt;ref name=sm101&gt;{{Cite book |authorlink=Jay Wiseman |last=Wiseman |first=Jay |title=SM 101: A Realistic Introduction |publisher=Greenery Press |location=California |year=1998 |isbn=978-0-9639763-8-3 |postscript= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dossie Easton, Janet W. Hardy: The New Topping Book. Page 71, Greenery Press (CA) 2002,&lt;/ref&gt; Failure to honor a safeword is considered serious misconduct and could even change the sexual consent situation into a crime, depending on the relevant law,&lt;ref name=sm101 /&gt; since the bottom has explicitly revoked his or her consent to any actions which follow the use of the safeword (see [[BDSM#Legal status|Legal status]]).

===Safety===
{{See also|Negotiation (BDSM)|Risk-aware consensual kink}}
Aside from the general advice related to [[safe sex]], BDSM sessions often require a wider array of safety precautions than typical [[vanilla sex]] (sexual behavior without BDSM elements).&lt;ref name=sm101 /&gt;

To ensure consensus related to BDSM activity, pre-play [[Negotiation (BDSM)|negotiations]] are commonplace, especially among partners who do not know each other very well. These negotiations concern the interests and fantasies of each partner and establish a framework.&lt;ref&gt;David Stein: ''S/M’s Copernican Revolution:From a Closed World to the Infinite Universe'' and ''Safe Sane Consensual: The Evolution of a Shibboleth'' available at [http://www.lthredge.com/ds/history.htm s/m-leather history] {{dead link|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This kind of discussion is a typical &quot;unique selling proposition&quot; of BDSM sessions and quite commonplace.&lt;ref&gt;Bill Henkin, Sybil Holiday: Consensual Sadomasochism : How to Talk About It and How to Do It Safely, pages 80–94, Daedalus Publishing Company 1996, ISBN 978-1-881943-12-9&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[safeword]]s are often arranged to provide for an immediate stop of any activity if any participant should so desire.&lt;ref&gt;Deborah Cameron, Don Kulick: Language and Sexuality, Page 24, Cambridge University Press 2003, ISBN 978-0-521-00969-0&lt;/ref&gt; [[Safeword]]s are, by definition, not commonly used words during any kind of play. Such things as &quot;no&quot;, &quot;stop&quot;, and &quot;don't&quot;, are not appropriate as a safeword due to the tendency for people to say those things without meaning it. A safeword needs to be something one can remember and call to mind when things are either not going as planned or have crossed a threshold one cannot handle. The most common used form of safewords are &quot;green&quot;, &quot;yellow&quot;, and &quot;red&quot;. &quot;Red&quot; meaning to stop and there would be no further play. &quot;Yellow&quot; being, &quot;This is getting too intense&quot;. &quot;Green&quot; meaning that everything is okay.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

Participants of BDSM understand practical safety aspects; for instance they recognize which parts of the human body have a risk of damage to nerves and blood vessels by [[contusion]] or have a high risk of scar development. Using [[Crop (implement)|crops]], [[whip]]s, or [[Cat of nine tails|floggers]], the top's fine motor skills and anatomical knowledge can make the difference between a satisfying session for the bottom, and a highly unpleasant experience that may even entail severe physical harm.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph W. Bean: Flogging, Greenery Press (CA), 2000, ISBN 978-1-890159-27-6&lt;/ref&gt; The very broad range of different [[Sex toy|BDSM &quot;toys&quot;]] and physical and psychological control techniques often requires a far-reaching knowledge of details related to the requirements of the individual session, such as [[anatomy]], [[physics]], and [[psychology]].&lt;ref&gt;Jack Rinella: The Toybag Guide Series, Greenery Press (CA), e.g. The Toybag Guide to Hot Wax and Temperature Play, ISBN 978-1-890159-57-3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arne Hoffmann, ''Das Lexikon des Sadomasochismus. Der Inside-Führer zur dunklen Erotik: Praktiken und Instrumente, Personen und Institutionen, Literatur und Film, Politik und Philosophie.'', Page 42, Schwarzkopf &amp; Schwarzkopf 2000, ISBN 978-3-89602-290-5 (German)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Phillip Miller, Molly Devon, William A. Granzig : ''Screw the Roses, Send Me the Thorns: The Romance and Sexual Sorcery of Sadomasochism.'', PP. 95, Mystic Rose Books 1995, ISBN 978-0-9645960-0-9&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these risks, BDSM activities usually result in far less severe injuries than sports like boxing and football, and BDSM practitioners do not visit emergency rooms more often than the general population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Barker|Iantaffi|Gupta|2007|pp=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is necessary to be able to identify each person's psychological [[wikt:Squick|squicks]] or ''&quot;freakouts&quot;'' in advance in order to avoid them. Such losses of emotional balance due to sensory or emotional overload are a fairly common issue. It is important to follow their reactions [[Empathy|empathetically]] and continue or stop accordingly.&lt;ref name=sm101 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dossie Easton, Janet W. Hardy: The New Topping Book. Page 111&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aspects ==
The initialism BDSM includes psychological and physiological facets:

* Bondage &amp; Discipline (''B&amp;D'')
* Dominance &amp; Submission (''D&amp;S'')
* Sadism &amp; Masochism (or Sadomasochism) (''S&amp;M'')
* Types of Play

This model for differentiating among these three aspects of BDSM is increasingly used in literature today.&lt;ref name=&quot;Terms&quot;/&gt; Nevertheless, it is only an attempt at phenomenological differentiation. Individual tastes and preferences in the area of sexuality may overlap among these areas, which are discussed separately here.

=== Bondage and discipline ===
{{Main|Bondage (sexual)|Discipline (BDSM)|l1=Bondage|l2=Discipline}}
[[File:Tapegag (Bondage) 2 girls in rubber-leather.jpg|thumb|right|Two women tapegagged and cuffed to iron bars]]
Bondage and Discipline are two aspects of BDSM that do not seem to relate to one another because of the type of the activities involved, but they have conceptual similarities, and that is why they appear jointly. Contrary to the other two types, B/D does not define the Tops and Bottoms itself, and is used to describe the general activities with either partner being the receiver and the giver.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zakfar, A Professional Dominatrix 2010&quot;&gt;Zakfar, A Professional Dominatrix, 2010, Lulu.com, ISBN 978-0-557-64184-0.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term &quot;Bondage&quot; describes the practice of Physical restraining. Bondage is usually, but not always, a sexual practice.&lt;ref&gt;Matthias T. J. Grimme: ''Das Bondage-Handbuch. Anleitung zum erotischen Fesseln''. Charon-Verlag, Hamburg 1999, ISBN 978-3-931406-16-5. (German)&lt;/ref&gt; While bondage is a very popular variation within the larger field of BDSM, it is nevertheless sometimes differentiated from the rest of this field.&lt;ref&gt;Lee &quot;Bridgett&quot;Harrington: Shibari You Can Use: Japanese Rope Bondage and Erotic Macramé, Mystic Productions 2007, ISBN 978-0-615-14490-0.&lt;/ref&gt; Studies among BDSM practitioners in the U.S. have shown that about half of all men find the idea of bondage to be erotic; many women do as well. Strictly speaking, bondage means binding the partner by tying their appendages together; for example, by the use of handcuffs or by lashing their arms to an object. Bondage can also be achieved by spreading the appendages and fastening them with chains to a [[Saint Andrew's Cross (BDSM)|St. Andrews cross]] or [[spreader bar]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Jay |last=Wiseman |title=Jay Wiseman's Erotic Bondage Handbook |publisher=Greenery Press |location=CA |year=2000 |isbn=978-1-890159-13-9 |postscript= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term &quot;Discipline&quot; describes the Psychological restraining, with the use of rules and punishment to control overt behavior.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zakfar, A Professional Dominatrix 2010&quot;/&gt; Punishment can be pain caused physically (such as caning), humiliation caused psychologically (such as a public flagellation) or loss of freedom caused physically (for example, chaining the Bottom to the foot of a bed). Another aspect is the structured training of the Bottom.&lt;ref&gt;Bill Henkin, Sybil Holiday: Consensual Sadomasochism: How to Talk About It and How to Do It Safely, Page 71. Daedalus Publishing Company, 1996, ISBN 978-1-881943-12-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dominance and submission ===
{{Main|Dominance and submission (BDSM)}}
&quot;Dominance and submission&quot; (also known as '''D&amp;s''', '''Ds''' or '''D/s''') is a set of behaviors, customs and rituals relating to the giving and accepting of control of one individual over another in an erotic or [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] context. It explores the more mental aspect of BDSM. This is also the case in many relationships not considering themselves as sadomasochistic; it is considered to be a part of BDSM if it is practiced purposefully. The range of its individual characteristics is thereby wide.&lt;ref name=BBC20050922 &gt;{{cite news |title=Face to face: Dominatrix and submissive |date=22 September 2005 |newspaper=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/4271098.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bent forward strappado.jpg|thumb|right|[[Strappado bondage|Strappado]] with rope and a spreader bar. This practice has a distinct effect of immobilization and pain.]]

Examples of mentally oriented practices are ''education games'', during which the dominant requires certain forms of behavior from the submissive. Special forms include erotic roleplay like [[ageplay]], in which a difference in age, either real or enacted, formulates the background; or [[Human animal roleplay|petplay]]. Concerted deployed sexual rejection exercised on the partner can be an aspect of ''Dominance and Submission'' as well (see [[Cuckold#Cuckoldry as a fetish|cuckoldry]]). The most established and probably most cliché set form of dominance and submission is ''Dominance and slavery''. These can be administered for the short duration of a session among otherwise-emancipated partners, but also can be integrated into everyday life indefinitely. In a few relationships, it leads as far as total submission of one partner in the truest sense of the phrase ''total power exchange''. Compensating elements of the total dominance and submission are care and devotion complementing one another, thus facilitating stable relationships. The consensual submission of the sub is sometimes demonstrated to others by symbols indicating his/her belonging to the dom, such as [[Collar (BDSM)|wearing a collar]], special [[tattoo]]s, [[Body piercing|piercings]], a very short haircut or a bald head.

Often, &quot;[[Contract (BDSM)|slave contracts]]&quot; are set out in writing to record the formal consent of the parties to the power exchange, stating their common vision of the relationship dynamic. The purpose of this kind of agreement is primarily to encourage discussion and negotiation in advance, and then to document that understanding for the benefit of all parties. Such documents have not been recognized as being legally binding, nor are they intended to be. These agreements are binding in the sense that the parties have the expectation that the negotiated rules will be followed. Often other friends and community members may witness the signing of such a document in a ceremony, and so parties violating their agreement can result in loss of face, respect or status with their friends in the community.

In general as compared to conventional relationships, BDSM participants go to great lengths to negotiate the important aspects of their relationships in advance, and to take great care in learning about and following safe practices.

=== Sadomasochism ===
[[File:spank2.jpg|thumb|Erotic spanking on a male Bottom.]]

{{Main|Sadomasochism}}

The term ''sadomasochism'' is derived from the words ''sadism'' and ''masochism'' (see [[BDSM#Etymology|Etymology]]). In the context of consensual sexual activities, sadism and masochism are not strictly accurate terms; there is a significant difference from the medical or psychological usage of both terms. Sadomasochism refers to the physical aspects of BDSM. Sadism describes sexual pleasure derived by inflicting [[pain]], degradation, or humiliation on another person. On the other hand, the masochist enjoys being bound, spanked or suffering within the consensual scenario. Sadomasochism does not imply enjoyment through causing or receiving pain in other situations (for example, accidental injury, medical procedures). Discipline often incorporates sadomasochistic aspects. Sadomasochism is practiced in isolation relatively rarely, although certain practices BDSM can be performed solo, such as [[self-bondage]] and [[Erotic asphyxiation|autoerotic asphyxia]], but such practices can be dangerous, at times resulting in injury or death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Autoerotic Fatalities|first=Robert|last=Hazelwood|isbn=978-0-669-04716-5|publisher=Lexington Books|year=1983|coauthors=Dietz, Park Elliot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both, D/S and S/M self define the Top and Bottom, with Dominant/Sadist being the Top and Submissive/Masochist being the Bottom. Whereas in B/D the declaration of the Top/Bottom is required.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zakfar, A Professional Dominatrix 2010&quot;/&gt;

=== Physical aspects ===
[[File:Wax play on back.jpg|thumb|A woman's back covered with different colored waxes.]]
[[File:Cuffed ankles and toes.JPG|thumb|Use of hand and thumbcuffs on the feet with a [[Wartenberg wheel]]]]

On a physical level BDSM is commonly misconceived to be &quot;all about pain&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;barker13&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Barker|Iantaffi|Gupta|2007|pp=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most often though BDSM practitioners are primarily concerned with power, humiliation, and pleasure.&lt;ref name=&quot;barker13&quot;/&gt; Of the three categories of BDSM only sadomasochism specifically requires pain, but this is typically a vehicle for feelings of humiliation, dominance, and the such. The aspects of D/S and B/D may not include physical suffering at all, but include the sensations inherited by different emotions of the mind.&lt;ref name=&quot;barker13&quot;/&gt; Dominance &amp; Submission of power is an entirely different experience, and is not always psychologically associated with physical pain. Many BDSM activities might not involve any kind of pain or humiliation, but just the exchange of Powers (Power Exchange).&lt;ref name=&quot;Zakfar, A Professional Dominatrix 2010&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;barker13&quot;/&gt; During the activities, the practitioners feel [[endorphin]]s to the so-called &quot;runner’s high&quot; or to the afterglow of [[orgasm]].&lt;ref&gt;Goldberg, Jeff (1988). Anatomy of a Scientific Discovery. Bantam Books, 1988.

Some use the term &quot;body stress&quot; to describe this physiological sensation.&lt;ref&gt;Fries, DS (2002). Opioid Analgesics. In Williams DA, Lemke TL. Foye's Principles of Medicinal Chemistry (5th ed.). Philadelphia: Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins. ISBN 978-0-683-30737-5&lt;/ref&gt; This experience of [[algolagnia]] is important, but is not the only motivation for many BDSM practitioners. The philosopher [[Edmund Burke]] defines this sensation of pleasure derived from pain by the word ''sublime''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document |title=On Taste: On the Sublime and Beautiful; Reflections on the French Revolution; A Letter to a Noble Lord; with Introduction, Notes and Illustrations |first=Edmund |last=Burke |publisher=P. F. Collier &amp; son |year=1909 |postscript= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a wide array of BDSM practitioners who take part in sessions for which they do not receive any personal gratification. They enter such situations solely with the intention to allow their partners to fulfill their own needs and/or [[Sexual fetishism|fetishes]]. They do this in exchange of money for the session activities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zakfar, A Professional Dominatrix 2010&quot;/&gt;

In some BDSM sessions, the Top exposes the Bottom to a wide range of sensual impressions, for example: pinching, biting, scratching with fingernails, [[spanking]] or the use of various objects such as [[Crop (implement)|crops]], [[whip]]s, liquid [[wax]], [[Ice cube|icecubes]], [[Wartenberg wheel]]s, [[erotic electrostimulation]] or others.&lt;ref&gt;William Brame, Gloria Brame: Different Loving: The World of Sexual Dominance and Submission (Paperback), Villard , 1996, ISBN 978-0-679-76956-9&lt;/ref&gt; Fixation by [[handcuff]]s, [[rope]]s or [[chain]]s may be used as well. The repertoire of possible &quot;toys&quot; is limited only by the imagination of both partners. To some extent, everyday items like [[Clothespin|clothes-pins]], [[wooden spoon]]s or [[plastic wrap]] are used as [[pervertible]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Claudia Varrin: The Art Of Sensual Female Dominance: A Guide for Women, Citadel, 2000, ISBN 978-0-8065-2089-6&lt;/ref&gt; It is commonly considered that a pleasurable BDSM experience during a session is very strongly dependent upon the top's competence and experience and the bottom's physical and mental state at the time of the session. Trust and [[sexual arousal]] help the partners enter a shared mindset.&lt;ref&gt;John Warren, Ph. D: The Loving Dominant, Greenery Press (CA), 2nd Rev Ed, ISBN 978-1-890159-20-7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bill Henkin, Sybil Holiday: Consensual Sadomasochism : How to Talk About It and How to Do It Safely, Daedalus Publishing Company 1996, ISBN 978-1-881943-12-9&lt;/ref&gt; Some BDSM practitioners compare related sensations with musical compositions and representation, in which single sensual impressions are the musical notes of the situation. From this point of view, different sensuous impressions are combined to create a total experience leaving a lasting impression.

== Relationships ==
=== Roles ===
==== Top and bottom ====
[[File:Collar 01.JPG|thumb|A typical slave collar with ring for possible attachment of a leash. Such or comparable models are sometimes used by bottoms as a symbol of ownership to their tops.]]
{{Main|Top (BDSM)|Bottom (BDSM)}}
In a BDSM relationship the partner who has the active (i.e. controlling) role in a session or in the entire relationship is described as the &quot;top&quot;, a role that often involves inflicting pain, degradation or subjugation. The partner referred to as the &quot;bottom&quot;, or more frequently as the ''sub'' (short for submissive), submits voluntarily to the actions of the top. Although the top usually is the dominant and the bottom the submissive partner, it is not inevitably so. In some cases the top follows instructions, i.e., he &quot;tops&quot; the bottom according to the bottom's desires and in a way the bottom expressly requires. A top only having apparent control, while in reality conforming to the instructions given by the bottom, is referred to as a ''service top''. In contrast a dominant top controls their submissive partner by using physical or psychological techniques. If desired the top can even instruct the submissive partner to exercise temporary control. The Japanese words 'Seme' and 'Uke' can respectively be used to describe the 'top' or 'bottom' within a BDSM relationship, or in [[yaoi]] to refer to the partner that is penetrating, and the partner that is being penetrated.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

A similar distinction also may apply to bottoms. At one end of the spectrum are those who are indifferent to, or even reject physical stimulation. At the other end of the spectrum are bottoms who enjoy physical and psychological stimulation but are not willing to be subordinate to the person who applies it. The bottom is frequently the partner who specifies the basic conditions of the session and gives instructions, directly or indirectly, in the prelude to the session, while the top often respects this guidance. Other bottoms try to incur punishment from their top by provoking them or &quot;misbehaving&quot;. Nevertheless a small, very puristic &quot;school&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.submissiveguide.com/2009/01/5-ways-to-recognize-topping-from-the-bottom/ 5 Ways to Recognize Topping from the Bottom]&lt;/ref&gt; exists within the BDSM community, which regards such &quot;topping from the bottom&quot; as incompatible with the standards of BDSM relations.

==== Switch ====
{{Main|Switch (BDSM)}}
BDSM practitioners may also be a &quot;switch&quot;, meaning they play either or both roles, top or bottom, depending on the actual session's setting. They may practice this within one specific session or take these different roles in different sessions with the same or different partners. There are many reasons for this. Sometimes a switch lives in a relationship with a partner of the same primary preference (for example, two tops), so switching represents the only possibility of being able to fulfill all of his or her BDSM needs within the relationship. Some people change roles without regarding themselves as switches since they do it very irregularly, or only under certain circumstances.

=== Types of relationships ===
==== Play ====
[[File:Sling.jpg|thumb|A typical BDSM &quot;sling&quot; .]]

BDSM practitioners sometimes regard the practice of BDSM in their sex life as [[sexual roleplaying|role playing]] and so often use the terms &quot;Play&quot; and &quot;Playing&quot; to describe activities where they're in their perspective roles. Play of this sort for a specified period of time is often called a &quot;Session&quot;, and the contents and the circumstances of play are often referred to as the &quot;Scene&quot;. It is also common in personal relationships to use the term &quot;Kink Play&quot; for BDSM activities, or more specific terms for the type of activity. The relationships can be of varied types.

==== Long term ====
Early writings on BDSM both by the academic and BDSM community spoke little of long-term relationships with some in the Gay Leather community suggesting short-term play relationships to be the only feasible relationship models, and recommending people to get married and &quot;play&quot; with BDSM outside of marriage. In recent times though writers of BDSM and sites for BDSM have been more focused on long-term relationships.

A 2003 study, the first to look at these relationships, fully demonstrated that &quot;quality long-term functioning relationships&quot; exist among practitioners of BDSM, with either sex being the top or bottom (homosexual couples were not looked at).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cutler|2003|pp=99}}&lt;/ref&gt; Respondents in the study expressed their BDSM orientation to be built into who they are, but considered exploring their BDSM interests an ongoing task, and showed flexibility and adaptability in order to match their interests with their partners.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;{{Harvnb|Cutler|2003|pp=102}}&lt;/ref&gt; The &quot;perfect match&quot; where both in the relationship shared the same tastes and desires was rare, and most relationships required both partners to take up or put away some of their desires.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; The BDSM activities that the couples partook in varied in sexual to nonsexual significance for the partners who reported doing certain BDSM activities for &quot;couple bonding, stress release, and spiritual quests&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cutler|2003|pp=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The most reported issue amongst respondents was not finding enough time to be in role with most adopting a 24/7 lifestyle wherein both partners maintain their dominant or submissive role throughout the day.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{Harvnb|Cutler|2003|pp=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amongst the respondents it was typically the bottoms who wanted to play harder, and be more restricted into their roles when there was a difference in desire to play in the relationship.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{Harvnb|Cutler|2003|pp=107}}&lt;/ref&gt; The author of the study, Bert Cutler, speculated that tops may be less often in the mood to play due to the increased demand for responsibility on their part: being aware of the safety of the situation and prepared to remove the bottom from a dangerous scenario, being conscious of the desires and limits of the bottom, and so on.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; The author of the study stressed that successful long-term BDSM relationships came after &quot;early and thorough disclosure&quot; from both parties of their BDSM interests.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

Many of those engaged in long-term BDSM relationships learned their skills from larger BDSM organizations and communities&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cutler|2003|pp=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a lot of discussion by the respondents on the amount of control the top possessed in the relationships with almost non-existent discussion of the top &quot;being better, or smarter, or of more value&quot; than the bottom.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{Harvnb|Cutler|2003|pp=109}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Couples were generally of the same mind of whether or not they were in 24/7 relationship, but noted that in such cases the bottom is not locked up 24/7, but that their role in the context of the relationship was always present, even when the top is doing non-dominant activities such as household chores: cleaning, taking out the trash, and so on., or the bottom being in a more dominant position.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; In its conclusion the study states:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''The respondents valued themselves, their partners, and their relationships.  All couples expressed considerable good will toward their partners.  The power exchange between the cohorts appears to be serving purposes beyond any sexual satisfaction, including experiencing a sense of being taken care of and bonding with a partner.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cutler|2003|pp=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The study further goes on to list three aspects that made the successful relationships work: early disclosure of interests and continued transparency, a commitment to personal growth, and the use of the dominant/submissive roles as a tool to maintain the relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cutler|2003|pp=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his closing remarks the author of the study theorizes that due to the serious potential for harm that couples in BDSM relationships develop increased communication that may be higher than in mainstream relationships&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cutler|2003|pp=112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== 24/7 lifestyle =====
[[File:Folsom 2003 bondage demo.jpg|thumb|Demonstration of [[Japanese bondage|Shibari]] bondage techniques at the Folsom 2003 street fair.]]

A subset of long-term BDSM relationships are relationships in which everyday life is clearly framed by the concept of BDSM even outside of sexual activities.&lt;ref name=sm101 /&gt; The partners involved maintain in their daily life an appropriate balance of power and accordingly make aspects of BDSM a consistent part of their lifestyle. Here, BDSM cannot be designated a merely sexual phenomenon. The term &quot;[[24/7]] relationship&quot; is derived from 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Another term for such behavior is &quot;D/s&quot;, derived from &quot;Dominant/submissive&quot;. The dominant partner controls most aspects of the submissive's life. Particular areas of life such as work, family, or friends can be excluded from the D/s relationship and not be placed under control of the dominant partner. Some D/s relationships, however, cover all areas of life; such constellations are designated as a &quot;[[Total Power Exchange]]&quot; (TPE). In D/s, and especially in TPE relationships, changes in the balance of power (so-called &quot;Switching&quot;) only rarely take place. TPE relationships probably represent the least common role behavior within the BDSM spectrum. One such [[Matriarchal]] community that promotes this is the [[Other World Kingdom]] community.

==== Professional services ====
A professional [[dominatrix]] or [[professional dominant]], often referred to within the culture as a &quot;pro-domme&quot;, offers services encompassing the range of bondage, discipline, and dominance in exchange for money. Such professional services might not include sexual intercourse, and may and may not include masturbation or ejaculation of semen by other means. In many cases, the gratification or climax of the client does not include direct orgasm, and is dealt respectively. It is common among dominatrices to separate themselves from [[Prostitution|prostitutes]], though there are plenty of prostitutes who also work as professional dominatrices.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zakfar, A Professional Dominatrix 2010&quot;/&gt;

The term &quot;Dominatrix&quot; is little-used within the non-professional BDSM scene. A non-professional dominant woman is more commonly referred to simply as a &quot;Domme&quot;, &quot;Dominant&quot;, or &quot;Femdom&quot;. There are also services provided by professional female submissives (&quot;pro-subs&quot;). A professional submissive consents to her client's dominant behavior within negotiated limits, and often works within a professional [[dungeon (BDSM)|dungeon]]. Although far more rare [[professional submissive]]s do exist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.professionalsubmissives.com/ Directory of Professional Submssives]&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the people who work as subs normally have tendencies towards such activities, especially when sadomasochism is involved.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} Males also work as professional &quot;Tops&quot; in BDSM, and are called &quot;Doms&quot; or &quot;Maledoms&quot;. However it is much more rare to find a male in this profession. (It should also be noted that a male &quot;pro-dom&quot; typically only works with male clientele)&lt;ref name=&quot;Zakfar, A Professional Dominatrix 2010&quot;/&gt;

== Scene: subculture and public ==
{{See also|BDSM in culture and media}}
[[File:S&amp;M Dungeon 2 by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|Spanking with a [[paddle (spanking)|paddle]] in a BDSM dungeon in New York City.]]

Today the BDSM culture exists in most western countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldwidebdsm.com/Club-&amp;amp-Munch-Directory |title=Worldwide Club and Munch Directory|accessdate=2007-12-11|work=www.worldwidebdsm.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; This offers BDSM practitioners the opportunity to discuss BDSM relevant topics and problems with like-minded people. This culture is often viewed as a [[subculture]], mainly because BDSM is often still regarded as &quot;unusual&quot; by some of the public. Many people hide their leaning from society since they are afraid of the incomprehension and of social exclusion. It is commonly known in the BDSM culture that there are practitioners living on all continents, but there is no documented evidence for many countries (due to restrictive laws and censorship motivated by politics or religion) except their presence in online BDSM communities and dating sites.

This scene appears particularly on the [[Internet]], in publications, and in meetings such as SM parties, gatherings called [[Munch (BDSM)|munches]], and erotic fairs. The annual ''[[Folsom Street Fair]]'' is the world's largest BDSM event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://folsomstreetfair.org/|title=Folsom Street Fair|accessdate=2007-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has its roots in the gay leather movement. There are also conventions like [[National Leather Association International|''Living in Leather'']], ''[[TESfest]]' Shibaricon, Spankfest, and [[Black Rose (BDSM organization)|Black Rose]]. North American cities that have large BDSM communities include [[New York City]], [[Atlanta]], [[Seattle]], [[Denver]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Boston]], [[Chicago]], [[Houston]], [[Philadelphia]], [[San Francisco]], [[San Diego]], [[Dallas]], [[Minneapolis]], [[Toronto]], [[Winnipeg]], and [[Vancouver]]. European cities with large BDSM communities include [[London]], [[Paris]], [[Berlin]], [[Amsterdam]], [[Munich]], [[Cologne]], [[Hamburg]] and [[Rome]].

=== Symbols ===
[[File:Leather, Latex, and BDSM pride.svg|thumb|The [[Leather Pride flag]], a symbol of the BDSM and Fetish subculture.]]
[[File:BDSM logo.svg|thumb|[[Triskelion]]-type BDSM emblem.]]
BDSM and fetish items and styles have been spread widely in western societies' everyday life by different factors, such as [[avant-garde]] [[fashion]], [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]], [[goth subculture]], and [[science fiction]] TV series,&lt;ref&gt;Fuentes Rodríguez, César: ''Mundo Gótico''. (Quarentena Ediciones, 2007, ISBN 978-84-933891-6-1)&lt;/ref&gt; and are often not consciously connected with their BDSM roots by many people. While it was mainly confined to the [[Punk subculture|Punk]] and BDSM subcultures in the 1990s, it has since spread into wider parts of western societies.

The ''[[Leather Pride flag]]'' is a symbol for the Leather subculture and also widely used within BDSM. In continental Europe the ''[[Ring of O]]'' is widespread among BDSM practitioners. The [[Triskele|Triskelion]], is common in English-speaking communities.

[[File:BDSM-rights-flag-Tanos.svg|120px|alt=BDSM Rights Flag colour]]
[[File:BDSM Rights Flag Black and White.svg|100px|alt=BDSM Rights Flag Black and White]]

The BDSM Rights Flag intended to represent the belief that people whose sexuality or relationship preferences include Bondage and Discipline, Dominance and Submission, or Sadism and Masochism (&quot;BDSM&quot;) deserve the same human rights as everyone else, and should not be discriminated against for pursuing BDSM with consenting adults.

The flag is inspired by the Leather Pride Flag and Quagmyr's BDSM Emblem, but is specifically intended to represent the concept of BDSM Rights and to be without the other symbols' restrictions against commercial use. It's designed to be recognisable by people familiar with either the Leather Pride Flag or BDSM Triskelion (or Triskele) as &quot;something to do with BDSM&quot;; and to be distinctive whether reproduced in full colour, or in black and white (or another pair of colours.)&lt;ref name=&quot;bdsmrights&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title= BDSMrights.com |url=http://www.bdsmrights.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Prejudices ===
[[File:CSD 2006 Cologne BDSM 07.jpg|thumb|upright|''Exhibition'' of a male sub in [[Zentai]] and chains at the [[Cologne Gay Pride]] festival, 2006.]]
Understanding of BDSM culture and practices remains intertwined with [[prejudice]]s, [[cliché]]s and [[stereotype]]s. Misunderstandings may arise from general lack of knowledge concerning sexuality and sexual practices as well as misconceptions on how one's personal life and public persona can vary greatly. For example, it is sometimes assumed that a submissive would prefer to experience pain and degradation in their everyday life, or conversely, that they would prefer to have exactly the opposite. There is no clear correlation between the position in everyday life and BDSM preferences. A further misunderstanding is that members of BDSM communities want only to be hurt or to inflict physical, psychological and mental pain, which diminishes and disparages the emotional and spiritual relationships that develop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bccla.org/othercontent/06BDSM.pdf |title=BCCLA Position Paper Sexuality and Civil Rights |accessdate=2007-12-10 |work=Cases involving prejudices against BDSM practitioners |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another misconception is the idea of women generally being the dominant party in BDSM relationships. Quite often the picture of BDSM is reduced to the idea of crude corporal punishment, neglecting the broad spectrum of behaviors within the culture. Along with the whip-swinging dominatrix, the sadomasochist in full leather regalia is another common cliché. While overlaps between different kinds of [[Sexual fetishism|fetishism]] can exist, there is no inevitable connection between BDSM and fetishism (for example,: latex, PVC or leather). The frequent occurrence of such clothing can be partly explained by its function as a quasi-formalized dress code.

Since the term BDSM covers a broad range of human behavior, the arising spectrum of individual interests and personalities is large and extremely diverse. Due to the lack of information in the total population and the reluctance with many to [[coming out|come out]] about matters of an extremely personal nature leads to situations in which actions and statements of individual BDSM practitioners are accredited to the community at large just as the larger [[LGBT]] community has been characterized by [[drag queen]]s and other minority communities similarly mischaracterized.

At least in the western, industrialized countries and Japan, since the 1980s sadomasochists have begun to form information exchange and support groups to counter discriminatory images. This has happened independently in the [[United States]] and in several European countries. With the advent of the web, international cooperation has started to develop—for example ''[[Datenschlag]]'' is a joint effort of sadomasochists in the three major [[German-speaking]] countries, and the mailing list ''Schlagworte'' uses the model of a [[news agency]] to connect six countries. Some credit highly publicized events like [[Operation Spanner]] and the International leather contests with fostering international cooperation and collaboration.

=== Coming out ===
{{Main|Coming out}}

[[File:Ponygirl folsom2005.jpg|thumb|Carriage drawn by a Pony-Girl, ''[[Petplay]]'' at the ''Folsom Parade'' 2005.]]

Some people who feel attracted by the situations usually compiled under the term BDSM reach a point where they decide to come out of the closet, though many sadomasochists keep themselves [[closet(ed)|closeted]]. Even so, depending upon a survey's participants, about 5 to 25 percent of the US-American population show affinity to the subject.&lt;ref&gt;Janus, Samuel S. / Janus, Cynthia L., 1994 ''The Janus Report on Sexual Behavior'', Wiley, New York, ISBN 978-0-471-01614-4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;elliott&quot;&gt;Elliott, Leland / Brantley, Cynthia, ''Sex on Campus'', 1997, Random House, New York&lt;/ref&gt; Other than a few artists, practically no celebrities are publicly known as sadomasochists.

Public knowledge of one's BDSM lifestyle can have devastating vocational and social effects ([[Persona non grata]]) for sadomasochists. The reason for this is seen by some authors as primarily a lack of public educational advertising, exacerbated by overly lurid and sensationalized media coverage.

Within feminist circles the discussion has been split roughly into two camps: some who see BDSM as an aspect or reflection of oppression (for example, [[Alice Schwarzer]]) and, on the other side, pro-BDSM feminists, often grouped under the banner of [[sex-positive feminism]] (see [[Samois]]); both of them can be traced back to the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Alice Schwarzer: &quot;Weiblicher Masochismus ist Kollaboration!&quot; from EMMA Heft 2, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

Some feminists have criticized BDSM for eroticizing power and violence, and for reinforcing [[misogyny]]. They argue that women who engage in BDSM are making a choice that is ultimately bad for women.&lt;ref&gt;Alice Schwarzer, Emma Heft 2, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist defenders of BDSM argue that consensual BDSM activities are enjoyed by many women and validate the sexual inclinations of these women.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.columbia.edu/cu/sister/BDSM.html BDSM and Feminism: An Insider's View by Tammy Jo Eckhart] {{dead link|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; They argue that feminists should not attack other woman's sexual desires as being &quot;anti-feminist&quot;, and point out that there is no connection between consensual kinky activities and sex crimes. The main point of feminism is giving an individual woman free choices in her life; that includes her sexual desire. While some radical feminists suggest connections between consensual BDSM [[Scene (BDSM)|scenes]] and non-consensual [[rape]] and [[sexual assault]], sex-positive feminists may tend to find this insulting to women.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gayle Rubin]]: ''Thinking Sex: Notes for a Radical Theory of the Politics of Sexuality''. In Carole S. Vance (Ed.), ''Pleasure and Danger: exploring female sexuality'', pp. 267–319. Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, Boston 1984.

It is often mentioned that in BDSM, roles are not fixed to [[gender]], but personal preferences. Several studies on the correlation of BDSM pornography and the violence against women recapitulate that there is no correlation. [[Japan]] is a useful example: a country which has the lowest rate of sexual crimes of all industrialized nations while being well known for its comprehensive BDSM and bondage pornography (see [[Pornography in Japan]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Diamond|first=Milton|coauthors=Uchiyama; Ayako|title=Pornography, Rape and Sex Crimes in Japan|journal=International Journal of Law and Psychiatry|url=http://www.hawaii.edu/PCSS/online_artcls/pornography/prngrphy_rape_jp.html|volume=22|issue=1|pages=1–22|year=1999|doi=10.1016/S0160-2527(98)00035-1|authorlink=Milton Diamond|pmid=10086287}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991 a lateral survey came to the conclusion that between 1964 and 1984, despite the increase in amount and availability of sadomasochistic pornography in the US, [[Germany]], [[Denmark]] and [[Sweden]] there is no correlation with the national number of rapes to be found.&lt;ref&gt;[[Berl Kutchinsky]], ''Pornography and Rape: Theory and Practice?'' in: International Journal of Law and Psychiatry, Vol. 14, 1991, P. 47–66&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Operation Spanner]] in the UK proves that BDSM practitioners still run the risk of being [[Social stigma|stigmatized]] as criminals. In 2003, the media coverage of [[Jack McGeorge]] showed that simply participating and working in BDSM support groups poses risks to one's job, even in countries where no law restricts it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Pleasure, Pain, and Saddam Hussein |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2074821/ |periodical=[[Slate.com]] |first=Timothy Noah |date=3 December 2002 |accessdate=2008-11-09 |postscript= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Here a clear difference can be seen to the situation of [[homosexuality|homosexuals]].{{Clarify|date=January 2011}} The psychological strain appearing in some individual cases is normally neither articulated nor acknowledged in public. Nevertheless it leads to a difficult psychological situation in which the person concerned can be exposed to high levels of emotional stress.&lt;ref name=&quot;moser&quot;&gt;[[Charles Allen Moser|Charles Moser]], in ''Journal of Social Work and Human Sexuality'' 1988, (7;1, S.43–56)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the stages of &quot;self awareness&quot; , he or she realizes their desires related to BDSM scenarios and/or decides to be open for such. Some authors call this ''internal coming-out''. Two separate surveys on this topic independently came to the conclusion that 58 percent and 67 percent of the sample respectively, had realized their disposition before their 19th birthday. Other surveys on this topic show comparable results.&lt;ref&gt;[[Andreas Spengler|Spengler, Andreas]]: ''Sadomasochisten und ihre Subkulturen'', Campus Verlag, 1979, Frankfurt am Main / New York (German)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.datenschlag.org/umfrage/dpb1_ergebnisse.html [[Datenschlag]] survey (German)]&lt;/ref&gt; Independent of age, coming-out can potentially result in a difficult life crisis, sometimes leading to thoughts or acts of [[suicide]]. While homosexuals have created support networks in the last decades, sadomasochistic support networks are just starting to develop in most countries. In German speaking countries they are only moderately more developed.&lt;ref&gt;Eva Daschek und Axel Konrad: ''Empirische Untersuchung über den Zusammenhang zwischen ausgewählten Faktoren und inklinierendem sexuellem Sadomasochismus'', online [http://www.schlagabtausch-hd.de/sm-studie.php sm-study] (German)&lt;/ref&gt; The internet is the prime contact point for support groups today, allowing for local and international networking. In the US [[Kink Aware Professionals]] (KAP) a privately funded, non-profit service provides the community with referrals to psychotherapeutic, medical, and legal professionals who are knowledgeable about and sensitive to the BDSM, fetish, and leather community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncsfreedom.org/kap/index.php?option=com_keyword&amp;id=270 ncsfreedom.org]&lt;/ref&gt; In the USA and the UK, the [[Woodhull Freedom Foundation &amp; Federation]], [[National Coalition for Sexual Freedom]] (NCSF) and [[Sexual Freedom Coalition]] (SFC) have emerged to represent the interests of sadomasochists. The German Bundesvereinigung Sadomasochismus e.V. is committed to the same aim of providing information and driving press relations. In 1996 the website and mailing list [[Datenschlag]] went online in German and English providing the largest [[bibliography]], as well as one of the most extensive historical collections of sources related to BDSM.

=== Parties and clubs ===
[[File:Andreaskreuz mit Model Monique.jpg|thumb|A young female Bottom on a [[Saint Andrew's Cross (BDSM)|St. Andrew's cross]].]]

BDSM parties are events on which BDSM practitioners and other similarly interested people meet in order to communicate, share experiences and knowledge, and to &quot;play&quot; in an erotic atmosphere. The parties show similarities with ones in the [[dark culture]], being based on a more or less strictly enforced [[Dresscode (BDSM)|dress code]]; most often clothing made of latex, leather or vinyl/PVC, lycra and so on., emphasizing the body's shape and the primary and secondary sexual characteristic. The requirement for such dress codes differ. While some events have none, others have a policy in order to create a more coherent atmosphere and to prevent voyeurs from taking part.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.datenschlag.org/txt/smpabes.html datenschlag.org] (German)&lt;/ref&gt;

At these parties, BDSM can be publicly performed on a stage, or more privately in separate &quot;[[Dungeon (BDSM)|dungeons]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Dossie Easton, Janet W. Hardy: ''The New Topping Book''. Page 163&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual intercourse is only rarely seen, and almost taboo within most public play spaces. A reason for the relatively fast spread of this kind of event is the opportunity to use a wide range of &quot;playing equipment&quot;, which in most apartments or houses is unavailable. Slings, St. Andrews crosses (or similar restraining constructs), spanking benches, and punishing supports or cages are often made available. The problem of noise disturbance is also lessened at these events, while in the home setting many BDSM activities can be limited by this factor. In addition, such parties offer both [[Exhibitionism|exhibitionists]] and [[Voyeurism|voyeurs]] a forum to indulge their inclinations without social opprobrium. In order to ensure the maximum safety and comfort for the participants certain standards of behavior have evolved, these include aspects of [[courtesy]], [[privacy]], respect and [[safeword]]s among others.&lt;ref name=sm101 /&gt; Today BDSM parties are taking place in most of the larger cities in the western world.

In some cities there are specialized BDSM clubs with a more or less structured program schedule, in which theme parties alternate with topic-free &quot;play evenings&quot;, similar to the business concepts of more conventional [[nightclub]]s. Social control of these parties and/or in the clubs is far higher than in a normal discothèque. Consensuality in the public BDSM sessions is strictly monitored and enforced. Apart from commercial events there are also privately organized or only moderately profit-oriented parties, which are organized by BDSM groups and individuals. [[Minor (law)|Minors]] are not allowed at parties or clubs, even though intercourse and drinking are usually not found in these parties.

The percentage of women is significantly higher than that of most behavior patterns formally considered to be [[paraphilia]]s. Estimation on the overall percentage of BDSM related sexual behavior in the general population range from 5 to 25 percent, depending on the scientific objectives.

A non-representative survey on the sexual behavior of American students published in 1997 and based on questionnaires had a response rate of about 8–9%. It results showed 15% of openly homosexual males, 21% of openly lesbian and female bisexual students, 11% of heterosexual males and 9% of female heterosexual students committed to BDSM related fantasies.&lt;ref name=&quot;elliott&quot; /&gt; In all groups the level of practical BDSM experiences varied about 6%. Within the group of openly female bisexuals and lesbians the quote was significantly higher, at 21%. Independent of their sexual orientation, about 12% of all questioned students, 16% of the outed female lesbians and bisexuals and 8% of the male heterosexuals articulated an interest in spanking. Experience with this sexual behavior was indicated by 30% of male heterosexuals, 33% of female bisexuals and lesbians, and 24% of the male gay and bisexual men and female heterosexual women.&lt;ref name=&quot;elliott&quot; /&gt; Even if this study were not considered representative, other surveys indicate similar dimensions in a differing target groups.&lt;ref&gt;Brokmann, Angela: ''Macht und Erotik'', 1996, Sexologisches Institut e.

In a representative study published in 1999 by the German Institut für rationale Psychologie, about two thirds of the interviewed women stated a desire to be at the mercy of their sexual partners from time to time. 69% admitted to fantasies dealing with sexual submissiveness, 42% stated interest in explicit BDSM techniques, 25% in bondage.&lt;ref&gt;Arne Hoffmann, ''Lexikon der Tabubrüche'', Schwarzkopf&amp;Schwarzkopf, 2003, ISBN 978-3-89602-517-3 (German)&lt;/ref&gt; A 1976 study in the general U.S. population suggests three percent have had positive experiences with Bondage or master-slave role playing.

[http://www.kinseyinstitute.org/resources/FAQ.html#bdsm kinseyinstitute.org]&lt;/ref&gt; Some elements of BDSM have been popularized through increased media coverage since the middle 1990s. Thus both black leather clothing, sexual jewellery such as chains and dominance role play appear increasingly outside of BDSM contexts.

[[File:Ring der o.jpg|thumb|The [[Ring of O]] as a finger ring.]]
According to a 2005 survey of 317,000 people in 41 countries, about 20% of the surveyed people have at least once used masks, blindfolds or other bondage utilities, and 5% explicitly connected themselves with BDSM.&lt;ref name=&quot;Durex&quot;&gt;Durex Global Sex Survey 2005, P.15 Online [http://www.durex.com/cm/gss2005results.asp Durex Global Sex Survey 2005] {{dead link|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, 19% mentioned spanking as one of their practices and 22% confirmed the use of blindfolds and/or handcuffs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Durex&quot;/&gt; Some BDSM accessories, like the ''Ring of O'', have been integrated into the jewelry collections of internationally well known designers like [[Calvin Klein]].

=== Psychological categorization ===
In the past, many activities and fantasies related to BDSM were generally attributed to [[Sadism and masochism as medical terms|sadism or masochism]] and were regarded by [[psychiatrist]]s as an illness. Following the [[International Classification of Diseases]] (ICD-10) ''sadomasochism'' is categorized a &quot;Disorder of sexual preference&quot; ([[ICD-10 Chapter V: Mental and behavioral disorders#.28F60-F69.29 Disorders of adult personality and behaviour|F65.5]]) and described as follows: ''&quot;A preference for sexual activity which involves the infliction of pain or humiliation, or bondage. If the subject prefers to be the recipient of such stimulation this is called masochism; if the provider, sadism. Often an individual obtains sexual excitement from both sadistic and masochistic activities.&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;ICD-10 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

With the publication of the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM-IV) in 1994 new criteria of diagnosis were available describing BDSM clearly not as disorders of sexual preferences. They are no longer regarded as illnesses in and of themselves. The DSM-IV asserts that ''&quot;The fantasies, sexual urges, or behaviors&quot;'' must ''&quot;cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning&quot;'' in order for sexual [[Sadomasochism|sadism or masochism]] to be considered a disorder. In an [[Journal of Sex Education and Therapy|AASECT article]] providing guidelines for therapists working with BDSM clients, sexologists [[Charles Allen Moser]] and [[Peggy Kleinplatz]] highlight that distress can occur in BDSM patients due to stigma and discrimination surrounding BDSM, and that in these circumstances the role of the therapist is to ''&quot;validate the distress rather than to &quot;cure&quot; the BDSM desires.&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;[[Peggy Kleinplatz|Kleinplatz, Peggy]], and [[Charles Allen Moser|Charles Moser]]. &quot;Toward Clinical Guidelines for Working with BDSM Clients.&quot; Contemporary Sexuality 38.6 (2004): 1-4. Academic Search Premier. EBSCO. Web. 2 Jan. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The DSM-IVs' latest edition (DSM-IV-TR) further requires that the activity must be the sole means of sexual gratification for a period of six (6) months, and either cause &quot;clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning&quot; or involve a violation of &quot;[[Consent (criminal)|consent]]&quot; to be diagnosed as a paraphilia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/159/7/1249 Letter to the Editor of The American Journal of Psychiatry: Change in Criterion for Paraphilias in DSM-IV-TR.] Russell B. Hilliard, Robert L. Spitzer. 2002. Retrieved: 23 November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Overlays of sexual preference disorders and the practice of BDSM practices can occur, however.

In Europe, an organization called [[ReviseF65]] has worked towards this purpose in the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Reiersøl O, Skeid S |title=The ICD diagnoses of fetishism and sadomasochism |journal=Journal of homosexuality |volume=50 |issue=2–3 |pages=243–62 |year=2006 |pmid=16803767 |doi=10.1300/J082v50n02_12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, Denmark became the first [[European Union]] country to have completely removed sadomasochism from its national classification of diseases. This was followed by Sweden in 2009 and Norway in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.revisef65.org/Sweden.html|title=Fetish and SM diagnoses deleted in Sweden|publisher=ReviseF65|date=17 November 2008|accessdate=4 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.revisef65.org/friskmelding_eng.html|title=SM and fetish off the Norwegian sick list|publisher=[[ReviseF65]]|date=6 February 2010|accessdate=4 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent surveys on the spread of BDSM fantasies and practices show strong variations in the range of their results.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fakten&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Nackte Fakten – Statistik für Zahlenfetischisten |language=German |accessdate=2008-11-09 |url=http://www.datenschlag.org/txt/statistik.html |postscript= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless it can be stated that the vast majority of the researchers assume 5 to 25 percent of the population showing sexual behavior related to joyfully experienced pain or dominance and submission. The population with related fantasies is considered even higher.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fakten&quot;/&gt;

There are only a few studies researching the psychological aspects of BDSM using modern scientific standards. A pivotal survey on the subject was published by US-American psychotherapist [[Charles Allen Moser|Charles Moser]] in 1988 in the ''Journal of Social Work and Human Sexuality''.&lt;ref name=&quot;moser&quot; /&gt; His conclusion was that while there is a general lack of data on the psychological problems of BDSM practitioners, some fundamental results are obvious. He emphasizes that there is no evidence for the theory that BDSM has common symptoms or ''any'' common psychopathology; Clinical literature, though does not give a consistent picture of BDSM practitioners. Moser emphasizes that there is no evidence at all supporting the theory of BDSM practitioners having any special psychiatric problems or even problems based solely on their preferences.

Moser's results were supported by data presented to the 2007 [[World Congress of Sexology]] by Juliet Richters, Richard De Visser, Andrew Grulich, and [[Christropher Rissel]]. The researchers found that BDSM practitioners were no more likely to have experienced sexual assault than the control group, and were not more likely to feel unhappy or anxious. The BDSM males reported higher levels of psychological well-being than the controls. It was concluded that &quot;BDSM is simply a sexual interest attractive to a minority, not a pathological symptom of past abuse or difficulty with normal sex.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Richters, Juliet; Visser, Richard De; Grulich, Andrew; and [[Christopher Rissel|Rissel, Chris]] (2008). &quot;Selected Abstracts of Presentations During the World Congress of Sexology, 2007: Demographic and Psychosocial Features of Participants in BDSM Sex: Data From a National Survey,&quot; ''Journal of Sex Research'', 45(2), pp. 90–117.&lt;/ref&gt;

Problems do sometimes occur in the area of self classification by the person concerned. During the phase of the &quot;coming-out&quot;, self questioning related to one's own &quot;normality&quot; is quite common. According to Moser, the discovery of BDSM preferences ''can'' result in fear of the current non-BDSM relationship's destruction. This, combined with the fear of discrimination in everyday life, leads in some cases to a double life which can be highly burdensome. At the same time, the denial of BDSM preferences can induce stress and dissatisfaction with one's own &quot;vanilla&quot;-lifestyle, feeding the apprehension of finding no partner. Moser states that BDSM practitioners having problems finding BDSM partners would probably have problems in finding a non-BDSM partner as well. The wish to remove BDSM preferences is another possible reason for psychological problems since it is not possible in most cases. Finally, the scientist states that BDSM practitioners seldom commit violent crimes. From his point of view, crimes of BDSM practitioners usually have no connection with the BDSM components existing in their life. Moser's study comes to the conclusion that there is no scientific evidence, which could give reason to refuse members of this group work- or safety certificates, adoption possibilities, custody or other social rights or privileges. The Swiss psychoanalyst Fritz Morgenthaler shares a similar perspective in his book, ''Homosexuality, Heterosexuality, Perversion'' (1988). He states that possible problems result not necessarily from the non-normative behavior, but in most cases primarily from the real or feared reactions of the social environment towards the own preferences.&lt;ref&gt;Fritz Morgenthaler: ''Homosexuality, Heterosexuality, Perversion'', Analytic, April 1988, ISBN 978-0-88163-060-2&lt;/ref&gt; In 1940 psychoanalyst [[Theodor Reik]] reached implicitly the same conclusion in his standard work ''Aus Leiden Freuden. Masochismus und Gesellschaft''.&lt;ref&gt;Theodor Reik: ''Aus Leiden Freuden. Masochismus und Gesellschaft'', Fischer ,1983, ISBN 978-3-596-26768-2 (German)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Origins ===
[[File:Tomba Della Fustigazione.jpg|thumb|''[[Tomba della Fustigazione]]'' (Tomb of Flogging), latter sixth century b.c..]]
[[File:Sm2.jpg|thumb|Copper engraving, about 1780.]]
[[File:Édouard-Henri Avril (8).jpg|thumb|Flagellation scene, illustration to [[Fanny Hill]] by [[Édouard-Henri Avril]].]]

The historical origins of BDSM are obscure. During the ninth century BC, [[Flagellation#Association with religion|ritual flagellations]] were performed in [[Artemis Orthia]], one of the most important religious areas of ancient [[Sparta]], where the [[Cult of Orthia]], a pre[[Olympic Gods|olympic]] religion, was practiced. Here ritual flagellation called ''diamastigosis'' took place on a regular basis. One of the oldest graphical proofs of sadomasochistic activities is found in an [[Etruscans|Etruscan]] burial site in [[Tarquinia]]. Inside the [[Tomba della Fustigazione]] (''Tomb of Flogging''), in the latter sixth century B.C., two men are portrayed flagellating a woman with a cane and a hand during an erotic situation.&lt;ref&gt;Mario Moretti/Leonard von Matt: Etruskische Malerei in Tarquinia. Cologne 1974, Page 90, figs. 762-63, ISBN 978-3-7701-0541-0&lt;/ref&gt; Another reference related to flagellation is to be found in the sixth book of the ''Satires'' of the ancient Roman Poet [[Juvenal]] (1st–2nd century A.D.),&lt;ref&gt;[[Juvenal]]: [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/juvenal-satvi.html Satires 6, Lines 474–511]&lt;/ref&gt; further reference can be found in [[Petronius]]'s ''[[Satyricon]]'' where a delinquent is whipped for sexual arousal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/petronius.html Petronius: Satyricon] (lat.)&lt;/ref&gt; Anecdotal narratives related to humans who have had themselves voluntary bound, flagellated or whipped as a substitute for sex or as part of foreplay reach back to the third and fourth century.

The ''[[Kama Sutra]]'' describes four different kinds of hitting during lovemaking, the allowed regions of the human body to target and different kinds of joyful &quot;cries of pain&quot; practiced by bottoms. The collection of historic texts related to sensuous experiences explicitly emphasizes that [[impact play]], biting and pinching during sexual activities should only be performed consensually since only some women consider such behavior to be joyful. From this perspective the Kama Sutra can be considered as one of the first written resources dealing with sadomasochistic activities and safety rules. Further texts with sadomasochistic connotation appear worldwide during the following centuries on a regular basis.&lt;ref&gt;Kamasutra by Mallanaga Vatsyayana, translated by Wendy Doniger, Oxford University Press 2003, ISBN 978-0-19-283982-4 Book II: Chapters 4,5,7,8, Pages 45–64.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are anecdotal reports of people willingly being bound or whipped, as a prelude to or substitute for sex, during the 14th century. The medieval phenomenon of [[courtly love]] in all of its slavish devotion and ambivalence has been suggested by some writers to be a precursor of BDSM.&lt;ref&gt;Denis de Rougemont (1956), Love in the Western World: Describing the ideal of chast love influenced by the [[Cathar]] doctrines&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arne Hoffmann: ''In Leder gebunden. Der Sadomasochismus in der Weltliteratur'', Page 11, Ubooks 2007, ISBN 978-3-86608-078-2 (German)&lt;/ref&gt; Some sources claim that BDSM as a distinct form of sexual behavior originated at the beginning of the 18th century when Western civilization began medically and legally categorizing sexual behavior (see [[BDSM#Etymology|Etymology]]). There are reports of brothels specializing in flagellation as early as 1769, and John Cleland's novel ''[[Fanny Hill]]'', published in 1749, mentions a flagellation scene.&lt;ref&gt;John Cleland: Fanny Hill: Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure, Penguin Classics, (January 7, 1986), ISBN 978-0-14-043249-7 Page 180 ff&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources give a broader definition, citing BDSM-like behavior in earlier times and other cultures, such as the medieval flagellates and the physical [[ordeal ritual]]s of some [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] societies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/ordeals1.html. European medieval ordeals]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the names of the [[Marquis de Sade]] and [[Leopold von Sacher-Masoch]] are attached to the terms sadism and masochism respectively, the scenes described in Sade's works do not meet modern BDSM standards of informed consent.&lt;ref&gt;cp: Marquis de Sade: The 120 Days of Sodom, Pbl. ReadHowYouWant, (December 1, 2006), ISBN 978-1-4250-3448-1, pages 407–409 &quot;'You'll have no further use for these,' he muttered, casting each article into a large grate. 'No further need for this mantelet, this dress, these stockings, this bodice, no,' said he when all had been consumed, 'all you'll need now is a coffin.'&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; BDSM is solely based on consensual activities, and based on its system and laws, the concepts presented by Marquis de Sade are not agreed upon the BDSM culture, even though they are sadistic in nature.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zakfar, A Professional Dominatrix 2010&quot;/&gt; BDSM ideas and imagery have existed on the fringes of Western culture throughout the twentieth century. Robert Bienvenu attributes the origins of modern BDSM to three sources, which he names as &quot;European Fetish&quot; (from 1928), &quot;American Fetish&quot; (from 1934), and &quot;Gay Leather&quot; (from 1950).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanfetish.net/sexresearch.us/Dissertation.html Robert Bienvenu: Doctoral Dissertation – The Development of Sadomasochism as a Cultural Style in the Twentieth-Century United States] {{dead link|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another source are the [[sexual game]]s played in [[brothel]]s, which go back into the 19th century if not earlier. [[Irving Klaw]], during the 1950s and 1960s, produced some of the first commercial film and photography with a BDSM theme (most notably with [[Bettie Page]]) and published comics by the now-iconic bondage artists [[John Willie]] and [[Eric Stanton]].

Stanton's model Bettie Page became at the same time one of the first successful models in the area of fetish photography and one of the most famous [[pin-up girl]]s of American mainstream culture. Italian author and designer [[Guido Crepax]] was deeply influenced by him, coining the style and development of European adult comics in the second half of the twentieth century. The artists [[Helmut Newton]] and [[Robert Mapplethorpe]] are the most prominent examples of the increasing use of BDSM-related motives in modern photography and the public discussions still resulting from this.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20021112205909/http://www.uce.ac.uk/mapplethorpe/ University of Central England in Birmingham]: Attempted Confiscation of Mapplethorn book by Officials in 1997 for being obscene.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Leather movement ===
{{Main|Leather subculture}}
[[File:Leather Contingent Pride 2004.jpg|thumb|Start of the Leather contingent at the 2004 [[San Francisco]] [[gay pride]] [[pride parade|parade]].]]
Much of the BDSM ethos can be traced back to the gay male [[leather subculture|leather culture]], which formalized itself out of the group of men who were soldiers returning home after [[World War II]] (1939–1945).&lt;ref&gt;Robert Bienvenu, ''The Development of Sadomasochism as a Cultural Style in the Twentieth-Century United States'', 2003, Doctoral Dissertation, Online as PDF on [http://www.americanfetish.net/ Sadomasochism as a Cultural Style]&lt;/ref&gt; This subculture is epitomized by the ''Leatherman's Handbook'' by [[Larry Townsend]], published in 1972, which describes in detail the practices and culture of gay male sadomasochists in the late 1960s and early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Townsend, Larry ''The Leatherman's Handbook'' 1972 Olympia Press, seventh edition 2004 available from L.T. Publications P.O. Box 302, Beverly Hills, CA 90213-0302&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;compare [[Pat Califia]] (Edit.), Robin Sweeney (Edit.): ''The Second Coming: A Leatherdyke Reader.'' Alyson Pubns, 1996, ISBN 978-1-55583-281-0&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981, however, the publication of ''[[Coming to Power]]'' by lesbian-feminist group [[Samois]] led to a greater knowledge and acceptance of BDSM in the lesbian community.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gayle Rubin]]: ''Samois'', Leather Times, 21:3–7., 2004, available from: [http://www.leatherarchives.org/resources/issue21.pdf leatherarchives.org]&lt;/ref&gt;
They got into conflict with fundamentalist part of the feminist movement which considered BDSM to be the base of misogyny and violent porn.

Today the Leather Movement is generally seen as a part of the BDSM-culture instead as a development deriving from gay subculture, even if a huge part of the BDSM-subculture was gay in the past. In the 1990s the so called [[New Guard leather|New Guard]] [[leather subculture]] evolved. This new orientation started to integrate psychological aspects into their play.

===Internet===
In the late-eighties, the [[Internet]] provided a way of finding people with specialized interests around the world as well as on a local level, and communicating with them anonymously.&lt;ref name=sm101 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buzzle.com/articles/alternate-lifestyles-what-they-had-to-do-with-msn-chat.html Roy D'Silva, Published 17 September 2007: Alternate Lifestyles: What they had to do with MSN-chat]&lt;/ref&gt; This brought about an explosion of interest and knowledge of BDSM, particularly on the [[usenet]] group [[alt.sex.bondage]]. When that group became too cluttered with [[spamming|spam]], the focus moved to [http://groups.google.com/groups?q=soc.subculture.bondage-bdsm&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;btnG=Google+Search soc.subculture.bondage-bdsm].

In addition to traditional sex shops, which sell sex paraphernalia, there has also been an explosive growth of online [[adult toy]] companies that specialize in leather/latex gear and BDSM toys. Once a very [[niche market]], there are now very few [[sex toy]] companies that do not offer some sort of BDSM or [[Sexual fetishism|fetish]] gear in their catalog. Kinky elements seem to have worked their way into &quot;[[Vanilla sex|vanilla]]&quot; markets. The former niche expanded to an important pillar of the business with adult accessories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Birch|first=Dr Robert W.|url=http://www.leathernroses.com/generalbdsm/drbirchsextoys.htm|title=Adult Sex Toys|publisher=Leather Roses|accessdate=2008-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today practically all suppliers of sex toys do offer items which originally found usage in the BDSM subculture. Padded handcuffs, latex and leather garments, as well as more exotic items like soft whips for fondling and TENS for erotic electro stimulation can be found in catalog aiming on classical vanilla target groups, indicating that former boundaries increasingly seem to shift.

During the last years the Internet also provides a central platform for networking among individuals who are interested in the subject. Besides countless private and commercial choices there is an increasing number of local networks and support groups emerging. These groups often offer comprehensive background and health related information for people who have been unwillingly outed as well as contact lists with information on [[psychologist]]s, [[physician]]s and [[lawyer]]s who are familiar with BDSM related topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leathernroses.com/generalbdsm/generalbdsm.htm#toys|title=Implements/Toys|publisher=Leather Roses|accessdate=2008-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Etymology ===
[[File:Sade (van Loo).png|thumb|''Portrait of [[Marquis de Sade]]'' by Charles-Amédée-Philippe van Loo (1761)]]

The terms &quot;Sadism&quot; and &quot;Masochism&quot; are derived from the names of the [[Marquis de Sade]] and [[Leopold von Sacher-Masoch]], based on the content of the authors' works. In 1843 the Hungarian physician Heinrich Kaan published ''Psychopathia sexualis'' (&quot;Psychopathy of Sex&quot;), a writing in which he converts the sin conceptions of Christianity into medical diagnoses. With his work the originally theological terms &quot;perversion&quot;, &quot;aberration&quot; and &quot;deviation&quot; became part of the scientific terminology for the first time.{{Dubious|date=January 2011}} The German psychiatrist [[Richard Freiherr von Krafft-Ebing|Richard von Krafft Ebing]] introduced the terms &quot;Sadism&quot; and &quot;Masochism&quot; to the medical community in his work ''Neue Forschungen auf dem Gebiet der Psychopathia sexualis'' (&quot;New research in the area of Psychopathy of Sex&quot;) in 1890.&lt;ref&gt;Details describing the development of the theoretical construct &quot;Perversion&quot; by Krafft-Ebing and his relation to this terms, see Andrea Beckmann, ''Journal of Criminal Justice and Popular Culture'', 8(2) (2001) 66–95 online at [http://www.albany.edu/scj/jcjpc/vol8is2/beckmann.html Deconstructing Myths]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1905 [[Sigmund Freud]] described &quot;Sadism&quot; and &quot;Masochism&quot; in his ''Drei Abhandlungen zur Sexualtheorie'' (&quot;Three papers on Sexual theory&quot;) as diseases developing from an incorrect development of the child psyche and laid the groundwork for the scientific perspective on the subject in the following decades. This led to the first time use of the compound term ''Sado-Masochism'' (German &quot;Sado-Masochismus&quot;)) by the Viennese Psychoanalytic [[Isidor Isaak Sadger]] in its work ''Über den sado-masochistischen Komplex'' (&quot;Regarding the sadomasochistic complex&quot;) in 1913.&lt;ref&gt;Isidor Isaak Sadger: ''Über den sado-masochistischen Komplex.'' in: Jahrbuch für psychoanalytische und psychopathologische Forschungen, Bd. 5, 1913, S. 157–232 (German)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past BDSM activists turned repeatedly against these conceptual models, originally deriving from singular historical figures and implying a clear [[Psychopathology|pathological]] connotation. They argued that there is no common sense in attributing a phenomenon as complex as BDSM to two individual humans, as well one might speak of &quot;[[Leonardo da Vinci|Leonardism]]&quot; instead of [[Homosexuality]]. The BDSM scene tried to distinguish themselves with the expression &quot;B&amp;D&quot; for bondage and discipline from the sometimes pejorative connotations of the term &quot;S&amp;M&quot;. The abbreviation BDSM itself was probably coined in the early 1990s in the subculture connected with the [[Usenet]] newsgroup [[alt.sex.bondage]]. The earliest posting with the term which is now preserved in Google Groups dates from June 1991. Later the dominance and submission dimension was integrated into the connotation of BDSM, creating the compound [[acronym]] common today.

== Legal status ==
{{Main|BDSM and the law}}
[[File:Fettered Hands on Model.png|thumb|right|[[Bondage cuffs]]]]
[[File:Gags bit 01.JPG|thumb|A bit [[Gag (BDSM)|gag]] used in BDSM made of leather, steel and wood]]

It is entirely dependent on the legal situation in individual countries whether the practice of BDSM has any criminal relevance or legal consequences. Criminalization of consensually implemented BDSM practices is usually not with explicit reference to BDSM, but results from the fact that such behavior as spanking or cuffing someone could be considered a breach of personal rights, which in principle constitutes a criminal offense.

In [[Germany]], [[Netherlands]], [[Japan]] and [[Scandinavia]] such behavior is legal in principle. In [[Austria]] the legal status is unclear, while in [[Switzerland]] certain BDSM practices can be considered criminal. Spectacular incidents like the US-American scandal of ''[[People v. Jovanovic]]'' and the British [[Operation Spanner]] demonstrate the degree to which difficult grey areas can pose a problem for the individuals and authorities involved. For these reasons it is important for practitioners of BDSM to learn the legal status concerning BDSM activities in the country they reside in.

=== Germany ===
The practice of BDSM is not generally penalized in Germany if it is conducted with the mutual consent of the partners involved. To fulfill the charge of coercion the use of violence, or the threat of a &quot;severe mistreatment&quot; must involve an endangerment to life and limb. In cases where the continued application of the treatment could be ended through the use of a [[safeword]], neither coercion nor sexual coercion may be charged. Similar principles apply for charges of sexual abuse of people incapable of resistance. In such cases taking advantage of a person's inability to resist in order to perform sexual acts on that person would be clearly punishable. The potential use of the safeword is considered to be sufficient possibility for resistance since this would lead to the cessation of the act, so a true inability to resist is not considered to be in effect.

According to §194 the charge of insult (slander) can only be prosecuted if the defamed person chooses to press charges. False imprisonment can be charged if the victim—when applying an objective view—can be considered to be impaired in his or her rights of free movement. According to §228 of the German criminal code a person inflicting a bodily injury on another person with that person's permission violates the law only in cases where the act can be considered to have violated good morals in spite of permission having been given. On 26 May 2004 the Criminal Panel #2 of the [[Bundesgerichtshof]] (German Federal Court) ruled that sado-masochistically motivated physical injuries are not per se indecent and thus subject to §228.&lt;ref&gt;Decision of the Bundesgerichtshof, 26 May 2004, 2 StR 505/03, which may be found at: BGHSt 49, 166 ([http://juris.bundesgerichtshof.de/cgi-bin/rechtsprechung/document.py?Gericht=bgh&amp;Art=en&amp;Datum=2004-5&amp;Seite=0&amp;client=12&amp;nr=29672&amp;pos=19&amp;anz=244&amp;Blank=1.pdf bundesgerichtshof.de])&lt;/ref&gt;

Still, this ruling makes the question of indecency dependent on the degree to which the bodily injury might be likely to impair the health of the receiving party. According to the BGH, the line of [[indecency]] is definitively crossed when &quot;under an objectively prescient consideration of all relevant circumstances the party granting consent could be brought into concrete danger of death by the act of bodily injury.&quot; In its ruling the court overturned a verdict by the Provincial Court of Kassel, according to which a man who had accidentally strangled his partner to death had been sentenced to probation for negligent manslaughter. The court had rejected a conviction on charges of bodily injury leading to death on the grounds that the victim had, in its opinion, consented to the act.

Following cases in which sado-masochistic practices had been repeatedly used as pressure tactics against former partners in custody cases, the Appeals Court of [[Hamm]] ruled in February 2006 that sexual inclinations toward sado-masochism are no indication of a lack of capabilities for successful child-raising.&lt;ref&gt;Appeals Court of Hamm in its judgement of 1 February 2006, case number 10 UF 147/04, available online at the [http://www.justiz.nrw.de/ses/nrwesearch.php# Portal of the North Rhine-Westfalian Ministry of Justice] (German)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United Kingdom ===
[[United Kingdom|British]] law does not recognize the possibility of consenting to bodily injury. Such acts are illegal, even between consenting adults, and these laws are enforced ([[R v Brown]] being the leading case).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spannertrust.org/documents/sexualoffencesreview.asp|title=Spanner Trust submission to the Home Office Review Board on Sexual Offences|publisher=The Spanner Trust|accessdate=2008-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly consensual activities in the UK may not constitute &quot;assault occasioning actual or grievous bodily harm&quot; in law. The [[Spanner Trust]] states that this is defined as activities which have caused injury &quot;of a lasting nature&quot; but that only a slight duration or injury might be considered &quot;lasting&quot; in law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The History of the Spanner Case|url=http://www.spannertrust.org/documents/spannerhistory.asp|publisher=[[Spanner Trust]]|accessdate=2011-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision contrasts with the later case of [[R v Wilson]] in which conviction for non-sexual consensual branding within a marriage was overturned, the appeal court ruling that R v Brown was not an authority in all cases of consensual injury and criticizing the decision to prosecute.&lt;ref&gt;R v Wilson (1996). Text of ruling online at: {{cite web|title=R v Wilson (1996) 2 Cr App Rep 241|url=http://www.lawteacher.net/criminal-law/cases/consent-Wilson.php|publisher=LawTeacher.com|accessdate=2011-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Operation Spanner the [[European Court of Human Rights]] ruled in January 1999 in [[Laskey, Jaggard and Brown v. United Kingdom]] that no violation of [[Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights|Article 8]] occurred because the amount of physical or psychological harm that the law allows between any two people, even consenting adults, is to be determined by the [[jurisdiction (area)|jurisdiction]] the individuals live in, as it is the State's responsibility to balance the concerns of [[public health]] and well-being with the amount of control a State should be allowed to exercise over its citizens. In the Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill 2007, the British Government cited the Spanner case as justification for criminalizing images of consensual acts, as part of its proposed criminalization of possession of ''&quot;[[extreme pornography]]&quot;''.&lt;ref&gt;House of Commons: ''[http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmbills/130/en/07130x-n.htm#index_link_206 Criminal Justice And Immigration Bill]''&lt;/ref&gt;  

=== Italy ===
In Italian law BDSM is right on the border between crime and legality, and everything lies in the interpretation of the legal code by the judge. This concept is that anyone willingly causing &quot;injury&quot; to another person is to be punished. In this context though &quot;injury&quot; is legally defined as &quot;anything causing a condition of illness&quot;, and &quot;illness&quot; is ill-defined itself in two different legal ways. The first is &quot;any anatomical or functional alteration of the organism&quot; (thus technically including little scratches and bruises too); The second is &quot;a significant worsening of a previous condition relevant to organic and relational processes, requiring any kind of therapy&quot;. This could make it somewhat risky to play with someone as later the &quot;victim&quot; may call foul play citing even an insignificant mark as evidence against the partner. Also any injury requiring over 20 days of medical care must be denounced by the professional medic who discovers it, leading to automatic indictment of the person who caused it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ayzad.com/ Ayzad], ''BDSM – Guida per esploratori dell'erotismo estremo'', Castelvecchi, 2004 ISBN 978-88-7615-025-8&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Austria ===
§90 of the criminal code declares bodily injury (§§ 83, 84) or the endangerment of physical security (§89) to not be subject to penalty in cases in which the &quot;victim&quot; has consented and the injury or endangerment does not offend moral sensibilities. Case law from the Austrian Supreme Court has consistently shown that bodily injury is only offensive to moral sensibilities, thus it is only punishable when a &quot;serious injury&quot; (a damage to health or an employment disability lasting more than 24 days) or the death of the &quot;victim&quot; results. A ''light injury'' is generally considered ''permissible'' when the &quot;victim&quot; has consented to it. In cases of threats to bodily well-being the standard depends on the probability that an injury will actually occur. If serious injury or even death would be a likely result of a threat being carried out, then even the threat itself is considered punishable.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}
&lt;!--
Zum konkreten Fall der Körperverletzung durch Handlungen im BDSM-Bereich gibt es allerdings keine gefestigte Rechtsprechung. Es kann durchaus sein, dass der Oberste Gerichtshof im BDSM-Bereich auch leichte Körperverletzung als sittenwidrig und somit als strafbar ansieht. Ob eine Handlung gegen die guten Sitten verstößt, hängt in Österreich nämlich davon ab, ob einem vorbildlichen Menschen die Sorge um die Gesundheit des „Opfers“ wichtiger wäre als die Rücksicht auf dessen Wünsche. Es besteht also keine Rechtssicherheit.--&gt;

=== Switzerland ===
The age of consent in Switzerland is 16 years which also applies for BDSM play. Minors (i.e. those under 16) are not subject to punishment for BDSM play as long as the age difference between them is less than three years. Certain practices however require granting consent for light injuries with only those over 18 permitted to give consent. On 1 April 2002 Articles 135 and 197 of the Swiss Criminal Code were tightened to make ownership of ''&quot;objects or demonstrations [...] which depict sexual acts with violent content&quot;'' a punishable offense. This law amounts to a general criminalization of sado-masochism since nearly every sado-masochist will have some kind of media which fulfills this criteria. Critics also object to the wording of the law which puts sado-masochists in the same category as [[pedophilia|pedophiles]] and [[pederasty|pederasts]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.datenschlag.org/dachs/dachs2000_2004.html5. datenschlag.org(Oktober 2001)] (German) {{dead link|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ig-bdsm.ch/index.php?pid=24 Interessengemeinschaft BDSM Schweiz] (German)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nordic countries ===
In September 2010 a Swedish court acquitted a 32 year old man of assault for engaging in consensual BDSM play with a 16 year old woman (the [[age of consent]] in Sweden is 15).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelocal.se/29302/20100928 Man freed in landmark S&amp;M case]&lt;/ref&gt; Norway's legal system has likewise taken a similar position,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.revisef65.org/loven.html SM og loven] (Norwegian)&lt;/ref&gt; that safe and consensual BDSM play should not be subject to criminal prosecution. This parallels the stance of the mental health professions in the Nordic countries which have removed sadomasochism from their respective lists of psychiatric illnesses.

== BDSM and culture ==
{{main|Sadism and masochism in fiction}}

=== Theatre ===
Although it would be possible to establish certain elements related to BDSM in classical theater, not until the emergence of contemporary theatre could you see such topics as the main theme in the performing arts. Exemplifying this are two works: one Austrian, one German, in which BDSM is not only incorporated, but integral to the storyline of the play.

'''Worauf sich Körper kaprizieren''', [[Austria]]. Peter Kern directs and writes the script for this [[comedy]] which is a present day adaption of Jean Genet's 1950 film, A chant d'amour. A marriage in which the wife (film veteran '''Miriam Goldschmidt''') submits her husband ('''Heinrich Herkie''') and the butler ('''Günter Bubbnik''') to her sadistic treatment, until two new characters take their places.&lt;ref&gt;[[Der Standard]], edición del 03.09.2006&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ach, Hilde''' (Oh, Hilda), [[Germany]]. A play by Anna Schwemmer that premiered in [[Berlin]]. A young Hilde becomes pregnant, and after being abandoned by her boyfriend she decides to become a professional dominatrix to earn money. The play carefully crafts a playful and frivolous picture of the field of professional dominatrices.&lt;ref&gt;[[BILD]]-Zeitung, Berlín, 15 de marzo de 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Film ===
:''With film, the human being reaches the fullness of their status as voyeur. The film almost needs not mention it, an indivisible part of the human condition since the beginning of the century and millennium.''&lt;ref&gt;Revista Cinefagia, noviembre 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from films that are part of the commercial pornography circuit, cinema has been treated since its inception with in depth BDSM relationships, from 1909 to the present decade. The current decade in particular has an abundance of examples: ''[[Sade]]'', ''[[Quills]]'', ''[[The Piano Teacher]]'', ''[[Beyond Vanilla]]'', ''[[Secretary (film)|Secretary]]'', ''[[Wir leben]]'', among others.

Naturally, there are thousands of movies that touch on or contain accents of BDSM or generic sadomasocism, or contain scenes of BDSM scenarios: ''[[Last Tango in Paris]]'', ''[[Emmanuelle (film)|Emmanuelle]]'', ''[[Personal Services]]'', ''[[Basic Instinct]]'', ''[[Eyes Wide Shut]]'', not to mention many others, but these are not seen as part of the filmography of BDSM.

=== Literature ===
{{See also|List of BDSM authors}}
With regard to the history of BDSM in literature, it should be noted that in defining what literature constitutes being &quot;BDSM literature&quot; a list of books that write about one of the component parts of BDSM: sadomasochism, caning, D/s, and so on., is insufficient for determining what makes up works of BDSM. Such a list would be enormous in scope, and would not generate the integrating element that gives meaning to BDSM: the concept of consent and awareness on the part of the practitioners. Although examples of literature catering to BDSM and fetishistic taste was created in earlier periods, BDSM literature as it exists today cannot be found much earlier than [[World War II]].

A central work in BDSM literature is undoubtedly the [[Story of O]](1954) by [[Anne Desclos]] (under the pseudonym [[Pauline Réage]]) in addition to: ''9 ½ weeks''(1978) by '''Elizabeth McNeill''', ''Dezemberkind''(2003, 2004) by '''Leander Sukov''', some works of the writer '''Anne Rice''' (''Exit to Eden'', ''The Claiming of Sleeping Beauty'' (1983), ''Beauty's Punishment'' (1984) and ''Beauty's Release'' (1985)), ''Jeanne de Berg'' (''L'Image''(1956) dedicated to [[Pauline Réage]]), and the novel ''Topping from Below''(1999) by '''Laura Reese'''. More recently, the novels of '''Marthe Blau''': ''Submission'' and ''Between Your Hands''(2005). Works from the GOR series by [[John Norman]], and naturally all the works of [[Pat Califia]], [[Gloria Brame]], the group Samois and many of the writer [[Georges Bataille]] (Histoire de l'oeil-Story of the Eye, &quot;Madame Edwarda, 1937), as well as Bob ''Flanagan: Slave Sonnets'' (1986), ''Fuck Journal'' (1987), ''A Taste of Honey'' (1990). A common part of many of the poems of [[Pablo Neruda]] is a reflection on feelings and sensations arising from the relations of EPE or erotic exchange of power.

==== A new subgenre: BDSM romance====
The exponential increase in the BDSM community in the last 10 years has led to the emergence of a literary subgenre that previously did not exist: ''BDSM romance''. There have always been stories of bondage, sadomasochism, and so on.., observable since at least the 14th century, and earlier in mediums that poorly explored the area in this regard (see the ''Cantar de Mio Cid''), but this as a genre emerged in the twenty-first century.

In 2005 there were many authors dedicated to write prolifically, at least half a dozen novels per year, and in some cases based on own experience as practitioners of BDSM, or in other cases entering from an outside genre, and established BDSM writers becoming more frequent in authoring works.&lt;ref&gt;BISAM, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Art ===
{{See also|List of BDSM artists|List of BDSM photographers}}
As in the case of literature a list of BDSM art should not include works of the early history depicting sadomasochism, flogging, fetishism, and so on., but should start when the integrative aspects of BDSM become visible. In this sense figures such as those from Venus de Kostienki, Russia (3000&amp;nbsp;BC) or engraved on the tomb and the sarcophagus of the Egyptian aristocrat Bastret (1376&amp;nbsp;BC) are not considered BDSM art(as depicting BDSM was not their primary purpose).
For art which is undeniably BDSM art, it follows that the artist has spent most or part of their work dealing with BDSM, so an image of flogging by an artist who does many BDSM works is probably depicting BDSM, while the same image done by a historic maritime artist depicting life aboard a British vessel would probably not be considered BDSM art(although context, and the work itself would usually ultimately determine what the subject matter is discussing). Examples include:

* In [[Photography]]: '''Eric Kroll''' and '''Irving Klaw''' (with Bettie Page, the first bondage model), and Japanese photographer [[Araki Nobuyoshi]], whose works are exhibited in several major art museums, galleries and private collections, such as the Baroness Marion Lambert, the world's largest holder of contemporary photographic art. Also [[Robert Mapplethorpe]] who has dealt with BDSM themes in many of his works.

* Comic book drawings: [[Guido Crepax]] with ''Histoire d'O'' (1975), ''Justine'' (1979) and ''Venere in Pelliccia'' (1984); inspired by the work of [[Pauline Reage]], [[Marquis de Sade|Sade]] and [[Leopold von Sacher-Masoch]]. '''John Willie''' and the ''Adventures of Sweet Gwendoline''(1984) which was the basis for the film ''Gwendolyn''.

* In graphic design: [[Eric Stanton]] and his work on dominance and female bondage, as well as '''Hajime Sorayama''', '''Robert Bishop''' and '''Dolcetto'''.

&lt;/ref&gt; it has been distributed widely as the shell for the [[GNU operating system]] and as the default shell on [[Linux]], [[Mac OS X]] and [[Darwin (operating system)|Darwin]].  It has been ported to [[Microsoft Windows]] and distributed with [[Cygwin]] and [[MinGW]], to [[DOS]] by the [[DJGPP]] project and to [[Novell NetWare]].

Bash is a [[Command-line interpreter|command processor]] that's typically run in a text window, allowing the user to type commands which cause actions.  Bash can also read commands from a file, called a [[Shell script|script]].  Like all Unix shells, it supports  filename [[Wildcard character|wildcarding]], [[Pipeline (Unix)|piping]], [[here document]]s, [[command substitution]], [[Variable (programming)|variables]] and [[control flow|control structures]] for [[Conditional (programming)|condition-testing]] and [[iteration]].  The [[Keyword (computer programming)|keywords]], [[Syntax (programming languages)|syntax]] and other basic features of the [[Language (computer science)|language]] were all copied from sh.  Other features, e.g, [[C shell#history|history]], were copied from [[C shell|csh]] and [[Korn shell|ksh]].  Bash is a [[POSIX]] shell but with a number of extensions.

The name itself is an [[acronym]], a [[pun]] and descriptive.  As an acronym, it stands for ''Bourne-again shell'', referring to its objective as a free replacement for the Bourne shell.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ddj.com/cpp/184404693 C Programming] by Al Stevens, [[Dr. Dobb's Journal]], July 1, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;
As a pun, it expressed that objective in a phrase that sounds the same as ''[[Born again (Christianity)|born again]]'', a term for spiritual rebirth.&lt;ref&gt;

==Features==

The Bash [[command (computing)|command]] syntax is a [[superset]] of the Bourne shell command syntax. The vast majority of Bourne shell scripts can be executed by Bash without modification, with the exception of Bourne shell scripts stumbling into fringe syntax behavior interpreted differently in Bash or attempting to run a system command matching a newer Bash builtin, etc.  Bash command syntax includes ideas drawn from the [[Korn shell]] (ksh) and the [[C shell]] (csh) such as command line editing, [[command history]], the directory stack, the &lt;tt&gt;$RANDOM&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;$PPID&lt;/tt&gt; variables, and POSIX [[command substitution]] syntax &lt;tt&gt;$(…)&lt;/tt&gt;. When used as an interactive command shell and pressing the [[tab key]], Bash automatically uses [[command line completion]] to match partly typed program names, filenames and variable names.  The Bash commmand-line completion system is very flexible and customizable, and is often packaged with functions that complete arguments and filenames for specific programs and tasks.

Bash's syntax has many extensions which the Bourne shell lacks. Bash can perform integer calculations without spawning external processes, unlike the Bourne shell. Bash uses the &lt;tt&gt;((…))&lt;/tt&gt; command and the &lt;tt&gt;$((…))&lt;/tt&gt; variable syntax for this purpose. Bash syntax simplifies [[redirection (computing)|I/O redirection]] in ways that are not possible in the traditional Bourne shell. For example, Bash can redirect [[standard streams#Standard output (stdout)|standard output]] (stdout) and [[standard streams#Standard error (stderr)|standard error]] (stderr) at the same time using the &lt;tt&gt;&amp;&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; operator. This is simpler to type than the Bourne shell equivalent '&lt;tt&gt;command &gt; file 2&gt;&amp;1&lt;/tt&gt;'.
When using the 'function' keyword, Bash function declarations are not compatible with Bourne/Korn/POSIX scripts (the Korn shell has the same problem when using 'function'), but Bash accepts the same function declaration syntax as the Bourne and Korn shells, and is POSIX conformant.  Due to these and other differences, Bash shell scripts are rarely runnable under the Bourne or Korn shell interpreters unless deliberately written with that compatibility in mind, which is becoming less common as Linux becomes more widespread.  But in POSIX mode,&lt;ref name=&quot;GNUBASHREF&quot;&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Bash conformance with POSIX is nearly perfect.

Bash supports [[here document]]s just as the Bourne shell always has. However, since version 2.05b Bash can redirect [[standard streams#Standard input (stdin)|standard input]] (stdin) from a &quot;here string&quot; using the &lt;tt&gt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;/tt&gt; operator.

Bash 3.0 supports in-process [[regular expression]] matching using a syntax reminiscent of [[Perl]].&lt;ref&gt;The syntax matches that shown on the &lt;code&gt;[http://www.tin.org/bin/man.cgi?section=7&amp;topic=regex regex(7)]&lt;/code&gt; [[man page]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Bash 4.0 supports associative arrays &lt;ref name=GNUBASHREF/&gt; allowing faked support for multi-dimensional arrays, in a similar way to awk:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
declare -A a         # declare an associative array 'a'
i=1; j=2             # initialize some indices
a[$i,$j]=5           # associate value &quot;5&quot; to key &quot;$i,$j&quot; (i.e. &quot;1,2&quot;)
echo ${a[$i,$j]}     # print the stored value at key &quot;$i,$j&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

===Brace expansion===

Brace expansion, also called alternation, is a feature copied from the [[C shell]] that generates the set of alternative combinations. The generated results need not exist as files. The results of each expanded string are not sorted and left to right order is preserved:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
echo a{p,c,d,b}e # ape ace ade abe
echo {a,b,c}{d,e,f} # ad ae af bd be bf cd ce cf
&lt;/source&gt;
Brace expansions should not be used in portable shell scripts, because the Bourne shell will not produce the same output.

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
# A traditional shell does not produce the same output
echo a{p,c,d,b}e # a{p,c,d,b}e
&lt;/source&gt;

When brace expansion is combined with wildcards, the braces are expanded first, then the resulting wildcards are substituted normally.  Hence, a listing of JPEG and PNG images in the current directory could be obtained with:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
ls *.{jpg,jpeg,png}    # expands to *.jpg *.jpeg *.png - after which,
                       # the wildcards are processed
&lt;/source&gt;

===Startup scripts===
When Bash starts, it executes the commands in a variety of different scripts.

When Bash is invoked as an interactive login shell, it first reads and executes commands from the file &lt;tt&gt;/etc/profile&lt;/tt&gt;, if that file exists. After reading that file, it looks for &lt;tt&gt;~/.bash_profile&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;~/.bash_login&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;~/.profile&lt;/tt&gt;, in that order, and reads and executes commands from the first one that exists and is readable.

When a login shell exits, Bash reads and executes commands from the file &lt;tt&gt;~/.bash_logout&lt;/tt&gt;, if it exists.

When an interactive shell that is not a login shell is started, Bash reads and executes commands from &lt;tt&gt;~/.bashrc&lt;/tt&gt;, if that file exists. This may be inhibited by using the &lt;tt&gt;--norc&lt;/tt&gt; option. The &lt;tt&gt;--rcfile file&lt;/tt&gt; option will force Bash to read and execute commands from &lt;tt&gt;file&lt;/tt&gt; instead of &lt;tt&gt;~/.bashrc&lt;/tt&gt;.

Some versions of Unix have especially contorted system scripts for Bash which will effectively violate the documented script load order by loading scripts too early or attempting to combine Bash startup with the startup scripts for other shells in various ways.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

===Portability===
Shell scripts written with  Bash-specific features (''bashisms'') will not function on a system using the Bourne shell or one of its replacements, unless Bash is also installed and the script begins with a &quot;[[Shebang (Unix)|''shebang'']] ''line''&quot; of ''#![[/bin]]/bash'' [[interpreter directive]] instead of ''#!/bin/sh''.

===Keyboard shortcuts===
The following shortcuts work when using default ([[Emacs]]) key bindings. [[Vim (text editor)|Vi]]-bindings can be enabled by running &lt;code&gt;set -o vi&lt;/code&gt;.

{{See also|Readline}}

* {{Keypress|TAB}} : [[Autocomplete]]s from the cursor position.
* {{Keypress|Ctrl|a}} : moves the cursor to the line start (equivalent to the key {{keypress|[[home key|Home]]}}).
* {{Keypress|Ctrl|e}} : ([[wikt:end|end]]) moves the cursor to the line end (equivalent to the key {{keypress|[[end key|End]]}}).
* {{Keypress|Ctrl|p}} : ([[wikt:previous|previous]]) recalls the prior command (equivalent to the key {{keypress|[[arrow keys|Up]]}}).
* {{Keypress|Ctrl|n}} : ([[wikt:next|next]]) recalls the next command (equivalent to the key {{keypress|[[arrow keys|Down]]}}).
* {{Keypress|Ctrl|r}} : ([[wikt:research|research]]) recalls the last command including the specified character(s). A second {{keypress|Ctrl|r}} recalls the next anterior command which corresponds to the research
* {{Keypress|Ctrl|s}} : Go back to the next more recent command of the research (beware to not execute it from a terminal because this command also launches its XOFF). If you changed that XOFF setting, use {{Keypress|Ctrl|q}} to return.
* {{Keypress|Ctrl|o}} : executes the found command from research.
* {{Keypress|Ctrl|l}} : clears the screen content (equivalent to the command &lt;code&gt;[[clear (Unix)|clear]]&lt;/code&gt;).
* {{Keypress|Ctrl|u}} : clears the line content before the cursor and copies it into the [[clipboard (software)|clipboard]].
* {{Keypress|Ctrl|k}} : clears the line content after the cursor and copies it into the [[clipboard (software)|clipboard]].
* {{Keypress|Ctrl|w}} : clears the word before the cursor and copies it into the [[clipboard (software)|clipboard]].
* {{Keypress|Ctrl|y}} : ([[wikt:yank|yank]]) adds the [[clipboard (software)|clipboard]] content from the cursor position.
* {{Keypress|Ctrl|d}} : sends an EOF marker, which (unless disabled by an option) closes the current [[shell (computing)|shell]] (equivalent to the command &lt;code&gt;[[exit (command)|exit]]&lt;/code&gt;). (Only if there is no text on the current line)
* {{Keypress|Ctrl|c}} : sends the signal [[SIGINT (POSIX)|SIGINT]] to the current task, which aborts and closes it.
* {{Keypress|Ctrl|z}} : sends the signal [[SIGTSTP]] to the current task, which suspends it. To execute it in background one can enter &lt;code&gt;bg&lt;/code&gt;. To bring it back from background or suspension &lt;code&gt;fg ['process name or job id']&lt;/code&gt; ([[wikt:foreground|foreground]]) can be issued.
* {{Keypress|Ctrl|x}} {{Keypress|Ctrl|x}} : (because x has a crossing shape) alternates the cursor with its old position.
* {{Keypress|Ctrl|x}} {{Keypress|Ctrl|e}} : edits the current line in the $EDITOR program, or [[vi]] if undefined.
* {{Keypress|Alt|f}} : ([[wikt:forward|forward]]) moves forward the cursor of one word.

{{Weather}}
A '''blizzard'''  is a severe [[snowstorm]], characterized by strong winds. By definition, the difference between blizzard and a [[Winter_storm#Snow|snowstorm]] is the strength of the wind. To be a blizzard, a snow storm must have winds in excess of {{convert|56|km/h|abbr=on}} with blowing or drifting snow which reduces visibility to 400 meters or ¼ mile or less and must last for a prolonged period of time — typically three hours or more.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.weather.gov/glossary/index.php?letter=b ''Blizzard'' at the US National Weather Service glossary]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ground blizzards'' require high winds to stir up already fallen snow.

Blizzards can bring near-whiteout conditions, and can paralyze regions for days at a time, particularly where snowfall is unusual or rare. The [[1972 Iran blizzard]], which caused approximately 4000 deaths, was the deadliest in recorded history.

[[File:Bikini Model Jassi 3.jpg|thumb|Woman wearing a bikini]]
The '''bikini''' is a women's two-piece [[swimsuit]]. One part of the attire covers the [[breast]]s; the other the [[groin]] and part or all of the [[buttocks]], leaving an uncovered area between the two. The bikini is often worn in hot weather, while swimming or sunbathing. The shapes of both parts of a bikini resemble women's underwear, and the lower part can range from revealing [[thong (clothing)|thong]] or [[g-string]] to briefs. 

While two-piece bathing suits had been worn on the beach before, the modern bikini was invented by French engineer [[Louis Réard]] in 1946. He named it after [[Bikini Atoll]] in the Pacific, the site of the [[Operation Crossroads]] nuclear weapon tests in July that year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swimsuit-style.com/bikini.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.omg-facts.com/view/Facts/9262]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.co.in/books?id=T5pPpJl8E5wC&amp;pg=PA259&amp;dq=NAMED+AFTER+BIKINI+ATOLL&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=IQLRTdrvFc3rrQfA38zCCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CGAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=NAMED%20AFTER%20BIKINI%20ATOLL&amp;f=false]The Pacific Islands: an encyclopedia, Volume 1,By Brij V.

The bikini is perhaps the most popular female beachwear around the globe, according to French fashion historian Olivier Saillard due to &quot;the power of women, and not the power of fashion&quot;. As he explains, &quot;The emancipation of swimwear has always been linked to the emancipation of women.&quot;&lt;ref name=BBCW&gt;Kathryn Westcott, &quot;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/5130460.stm The Bikini: Not a brief affair]&quot;, BBC News, 2006-06-05&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid 2000s bikinis had become a $811 million business annually, according to the [[NPD Group]], a consumer and retail information company.&lt;ref name=SFC&gt;Sylvia Rubin, &quot;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2006/07/02/BIKINI.TMP&amp;type=printable Fashion shocker of '46: the naked belly button]&quot;, ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', 2006-07-02&lt;/ref&gt; The bikini has boosted spin-off services like [[bikini wax]]ing and the suntanning industries.&lt;ref name=AgeL&gt;Lorna Edwards, &quot;[http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2006/06/02/1148956539436.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap1 You've still got it, babe], ''[[The Age]]'', 2006-06-03&lt;/ref&gt;

A statue of Venus in a bikini was found in a cupboard in the southwest corner in Casa della Venere, others were found in the front hall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stoa.org/gallery/allison Pompeian Households], [http://www.stoa.org/gallery/albums.php Stoa Image Gallery], [http://www.stoa.org/ The Stoa Consortium]&lt;/ref&gt; A statue of Venus was recovered from the ''[[tablinum]]'' of the [[House of Julia Felix]],&lt;ref&gt;Mary Beard &amp; John Henderson, ''Classical Art'', page 116, Oxford University Press, 2001, ISBN 0192842374&lt;/ref&gt; and another from an [[Atrium (architecture)|atrium]] at the garden at [[House of Loreius Tiburtinus|Via Dell'Abbondanza]].&lt;ref&gt;Elisabeth B. MacDougall, Wilhelmina Mary Feemster Jashemski &amp; Dumbarton Oaks, ''Ancient Roman Gardens'', page 38, Dumbarton Oaks, 1979, ISBN 0884021009&lt;/ref&gt;

The groundwork for the modern bikini began to be laid in 1907, when Australian swimmer and performer [[Annette Kellerman]] was arrested on a [[Boston]] beach for wearing a form-fitting one-piece swimsuit, which became an accepted beach attire for women by 1910. In 1913, inspired by the introduction of women into Olympic swimming, designer [[Carl Jantzen]] made the first functional two-piece [[swimwear]], a close-fitting one-piece with shorts on the bottom and short sleeves on top.&lt;ref name=heritage&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/web/20060705-bikini-swimming-suit-louis-reard-micheline-bernardini-paris-brigitte-bardot.shtml|accessdate=2007-11-13|publisher=American Heritage Inc.|title=60 Years of Bikinis|author=Hoover, Elizabeth D.|date=2006-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1930s, necklines plunged at the back, sleeves disappeared and sides were cut away. Hollywood endorsed the new glamour with films such as ''[[Neptune's Daughter (1949 film)|Neptune's Daughter]]'' in which [[Esther Williams]] wore provocatively named costumes such as &quot;Double Entendre&quot; and &quot;Honey Child&quot;.&lt;ref name=notting&gt;David Sandhu, &quot;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/sunandsea/728059/Nottingham-Bathed-in-nostalgia.html Nottingham: Bathed in nostalgia]&quot;, ''The Telegraph'' (UK), 2003-08-04&lt;/ref&gt; With new materials like [[latex]] and [[nylon]], by 1934 the swimsuit started hugging the body and had shoulder straps to lower for tanning.&lt;ref name=carnival&gt;[http://www.carnaval.com/bikini/#In%20Brazil History of the Bikini], Carnival&lt;/ref&gt;

By the early 1940s two-piece swimsuits were frequent on American beaches. [[Hollywood]] stars such as [[Ava Gardner]], [[Rita Hayworth]] and [[Lana Turner]] tried similar swimwear or beachwear.&lt;ref name=3X24&gt;James Kitchling, [http://www.3x24.com/short-history-of-bikinis-and-swimsuits/801764 Short History of Bikinis and Swimsuits], 3X24 News Magazine&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pin up]]s of Hayworth and [[Esther Williams]] in the costume were widely distributed.&lt;ref name=heritage/&gt;

Finally, the modern bikini was introduced by French engineer [[Louis Réard]] and fashion designer [[Jacques Heim]] in Paris in 1946.  Réard was a car engineer but by 1946 he was running his mother's lingerie boutique near [[Folies Bergère|Les Folies Bergères]] in Paris.&lt;ref name=TimA&gt;Adam Sage, &quot;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article705414.ece Happy birthday: the 'shocking and immoral' bikini hits 60]&quot;, ''[[The Times]]'', 2006-04-16&lt;/ref&gt; Heim was working on a new kind of beach costume. It comprised two pieces, the bottom large enough to cover its wearer's navel. In May 1946, he advertised it as the world's &quot;smallest bathing suit&quot;. Réard named his swimsuit the &quot;bikini&quot;, taking the name from the [[Bikini Atoll]], one of a series of islands in the South Pacific where testing on the new atomic bomb was occurring that summer.  Historians assume Reard termed his swimsuit the &quot;bikini&quot; because he believed its revealing style would create reactions among people similar to those created by America’s atomic bomb in Japan just one summer earlier.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.randomhistory.com/1-50/002bikini.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Réard sliced the top off the bottoms and advertised it as &quot;smaller than the smallest swimsuit&quot;.&lt;ref name=Guard&gt;Paula Cocozza, &quot;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/2006/jun/10/sttropez.filminspiredtravel.france.culturaltrips?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=travel A little piece of history]&quot;, ''[[The Guardian]]'', 2006-06-10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lil&gt;[http://www.lilith-ezine.com/articles/2006/The-Bikini.html The Bikini Turns 60], 1946 to 2006: 60 Years of Bikini Bathing Beauties, ''Lilith E-Zine''&lt;/ref&gt; Réard could not find a model to wear his design. He ended up hiring [[Micheline Bernardini]], a [[stripper|nude dancer]] from the Casino de Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bikiniscience.com/chronology/1945-1950_SS/LR4601_S/LR4601.html | title = Michele Bernadini: The First Bikini | first = Judson | last = Rosebush | work = Bikini Science | date = | accessdate = 2007-09-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; That bikini, a [[#String bikini|string bikini]] with a [[g-string]] back of {{convert|30|sqin|cm2|0}} of cloth with newspaper type printed across, was introduced on July 5 at [[Piscine Molitor]], a public pool in Paris.&lt;ref name=heritage/&gt;&lt;ref name=HistC&gt;[http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history.do?action=VideoArticle&amp;id=6949 Bikini Introduced], This Day in History, ''[[History Channel]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Heim's design was the first worn on the beach, but clothing was given its name by Réard.&lt;ref name=BBCW/&gt;

From a 1949 ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' report: &quot;The bathing beauty queen—blond [[BeBe Shopp|Bebe Shopp]], 18, of Hopkins, Minn.—got an enthusiastic welcome in Paris, but she said she hasn't changed her mind about French swim suits. ...

==Bikini variants==
{{main|Bikini variant}}
[[File:Woman in black thong bikini with tattoo and wearing bracelets and wrist cuff.jpg|thumb|left|String bikini]]
[[File:Red polka tankini.jpg|thumb|Tankini]]

The bikini has spawned many stylistic variations. A regular bikini is defined as a two pieces of garments that cover the groin and buttocks at the lower end and the breasts in the upper end. Some bikinis can offer a large amount of coverage, while other bikinis provide only the barest minimum. Topless variants may still be considered bikinis, although technically no longer two-piece swimsuits.&lt;ref name=SStyle&gt;[http://www.swimsuit-style.com/bikini-swimsuit.html Bikini], Swimsuit Styles&lt;/ref&gt; Along with a variation in designs, the term ''bikini'' was followed by an often hilarious lexicon including the monokini (top part missing), seekini (transparent bikini), tankini (tank top, bikini bottom), camikini ([[camisole]] top and bikini bottom) and hikini.&lt;ref&gt;Barry J. Blake, ''Playing with Words: Humour in the English Language'', page 59, Equinox, 2007, ISBN 1845533305&lt;/ref&gt; Since fashions of different centuries exist beside one another in early 21st century, though it is possible to imagine a woman combining a bikini and a 1910 bathing costume.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Laurent &amp; Cécil Saint-Laurent, ''A History of Ladies Underwear'', page 214, Joseph, 1968, ISBN 0718106245&lt;/ref&gt;

Bikini tops come in different styles and cuts, including a halter-style neck that offers more coverage and support, a strapless [[bandeau]], a rectangular strip of fabric covering the breasts that minimizes large breasts, a top with cups similar to a [[Brassiere designs#&quot;Push-up&quot; bras|push-up bra]], and the more traditional triangle cups that lift and shape the breasts. Bikini bottoms vary in style and cut and in the amount of coverage they offer, coverage ranging anywhere from complete underwear-style coverage, as in the case of more modest bottom pieces like briefs, shorts, or briefs with a small skirt-panel attached, to almost full exposure, as in the case of the thong bikini. Skimpier styles have narrow sides, including V-cut (in front), French cut (with high-cut sides) and low-cut string (with string sides).&lt;ref name=SStyle/&gt; In just one major fashion show in 1985 were two-piece suits with [[Crop top|cropped tank tops]] instead of the usual skimpy bandeaux, suits that are bikinis in front and one-piece in back, [[Suspenders|suspender straps]], [[ruffle]]s, and daring, navel-baring cutouts.&lt;ref&gt;Fashion Correspondent, &quot;[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=PI&amp;s_site=philly&amp;p_multi=PI&amp;p_theme=realcities&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB29A230AE055D5&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM Swimsuits take some inspiration from the past]&quot;, ''Philadelphia Inquirer'', 1985-11-10&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent variations on the theme include the monokini, tankini, string bikini, thong, slingshot, minimini, teardrop, and micro.&lt;ref&gt;David Diefendorf &amp; James Randi, ''Amazing... But False!: Hundreds of &quot;Facts&quot; You Thought Were True, But Aren't'', page 33, Sterling, 2007, ISBN 1402737912&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bikini underwear===
Types of underwear worn by both men and women are identified as '''bikini underwear''', similar in size and revealing nature to the bottom half of a bikini bathing suit. For women, bikini underwear can refer to virtually any tight, skimpy, or revealing undergarment that provides less coverage to the midsection than traditional underwear, [[panties]] or [[knickers]]. For men, a bikini is a type of undergarment that is smaller and more revealing than men's briefs.

These bikinis are designed with functionality rather than fashion in mind.

In 1994, the bikini became the official uniform of women's Olympic [[beach volleyball]], sparking controversy, with some sports officials considering it exploitative and unpractical in colder weather,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/sport/591787.stm Aussies opt for bikini cover-up]&lt;/ref&gt; and athletes admitting that the regulation uniform is intended to be &quot;sexy&quot; and to draw attention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/olympics/article4357036.ece?print=yes&amp;randnum=1151003209000 Denise Johns: There is more to beach volleyball than girls in bikinis]&lt;/ref&gt; Dancers, sex appeal and bikinis worn by women players as much as athletic ability made beach volleyball the fifth largest television audience of all the sports at the Games at [[Bondi Beach, New South Wales|Bondi Beach]] in Australia in 2000 Olympics.&lt;ref&gt;Stuff Writer, &quot;[http://sports.espn.go.com/oly/summer04/gen/news/story?id=1860176 Beach volleyball a popular spectator sport]&quot;, ''ESPN'', 2004-08-16&lt;/ref&gt; The popularity of ''[[Dead or Alive: Xtreme Beach Volleyball]]'', a video game for [[Xbox]], was attributed to the scantily clad women.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Harold, [http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C00E1DD1731F934A3575BC0A9659C8B63 GAME THEORY; It's Hot-Potato Season: Call In the String Bikinis], New York Times, 2003-08-07; Retrieved: 2008-03-12&lt;/ref&gt;

===Athletics===
Often the women in [[athletics (sport)|athletics]] also wear bikinis, not much larger than in beach volleyball.

==Men's bikini==
[[File:František Huf.jpg|thumb|Posing brief in a [[bodybuilding]] contest]]
[[File:Mankini (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|80px|Mankini]]

The term '''men's bikini''' is used to describe types of [[Swim briefs|men's swimsuits]], men's underwear, or similar garments. Men's bikinis can have both high or low side panels, string sides or tie sides, and most lack a button or flap front. Many do not have a visible waistband like briefs. Suits less than 1.5&amp;nbsp;inches wide at the hips are less common for sporting purposes and are most often worn for recreation, [[fashion]], and [[sun tanning]]. An example of this style, known as the posing brief, is the standard for competitions in the sport of [[bodybuilding]]. Male [[punk rock]] musicians have performed on the stage wearing women's bikini briefs.&lt;ref&gt;A. W. Richard Sipe, ''A Secret World'', page 25, Psychology Press, 1990, ISBN 0876305850&lt;/ref&gt; The 2000 [[Bollywood]] film ''[[Hera Pheri (2000 film)|Hera Pheri]]'' shows men sunbathing in bikinis, who were mistakenly believed to be girls from a distance by the protagonist.&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Vanita, ''Queering India'', page 207, Routledge, 2002, ISBN 0415929504&lt;/ref&gt;

Swimsuits shown in men's wear collections by [[Giorgio Armani]], [[Dolce &amp; Gabbana]] or [[Paul Smith (fashion designer)|Paul Smith]] have tended to be black and snug fitting, throwbacks to the designs of the 1930s and '40s, while [[Gianni Versace]]'s ads with their heroic depictions of Miami bathers in contrast to popular, sports-inspired beach wear—bright and baggy Bermudas or boxer shorts. The Greek designer [[Nikos Apostolopoulos]] put a different spin on his bathing suits (for both sexes, but with the focus on the male), making them anatomical creations, cut and stitched to outline the body and its sexual characteristics.&lt;ref name=menkes&gt;Suzy Menkes, &quot;[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE7D81430F93BA25754C0A965958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=2 Runways: Remembrance of Thongs Past]&quot;, ''The New York Times'', 1993-07-18&lt;/ref&gt;
Bikini tops for men are seen as an amusement factor.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Karnasiewicz, [http://www.salon.com/mwt/broadsheet/2006/01/19/mr_saugus/ Here she comes, &quot;Mr. Saugus High School&quot;], Salon.com&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mankini===
'''Mankini''' is a type of sling bikini worn by men. It was popularized by [[Sacha Baron Cohen]] when he donned one in the film ''[[Borat]]''. The buzz around the film started building during the [[Cannes Film Festival]] in May 2006, when Baron Cohen posed in character on the beach in a neon green mankini, alongside four models.&lt;ref&gt;Josh Friedman &amp; Lorenza Munoz, &quot;[http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/1150656071.html?dids=1150656071:1150656071&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=Oct+25%2C+2006&amp;author=Josh+Friedman+and+Lorenza+Munoz&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times&amp;desc=Fox+scales+back+%60Borat%27+movie%27s+opening%3B+The+comedy+will+first+be+shown+in+800+theaters%2C+down+from+2%2C000%2C+amid+a+lack+of+awareness.&amp;pqatl=google Fox scales back `Borat' movie's opening; The comedy will first be shown in 800 theaters, down from 2,000, amid a lack of awareness]&quot;, ''The Los Angeles Times'', page C1, 2006-10-25&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Zahir ud-din Muhammad Babur'''({{lang-ur|ظہیرالدین محمد بابر}})({{lang-hi|ज़हीरुद्दीन मुहम्मद बाबर}}), more commonly known as '''Babur''', ({{OldStyleDate|February 23|1483|February 14}} — {{OldStyleDate|January 5|1531|December 26, 1530}}) was a military adventurer from [[Central Asia]] who rose to power at [[Kabul]] (present-day [[Afghanistan]]) after establishing his first kingdom in 1504. From there he built an army and conquered nearby regions until 1526, when he invaded the [[Lodi dynasty|Lodi Afghan Empire]] of [[South Asia]] and laid the basis for the [[Mughal Empire]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Loc-Afghanistan&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+af0009) |title=Mughal-Safavid Rivalry, ca. 1500-1747 |year=1997 |publisher=[[Library of Congress Country Studies]]: Afghanistan |accessdate=2011-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Babur was a descendant of [[Timur]] through his father, and [[Genghis Khan]] through his mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/47524/Babur |title=Babur |publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |accessdate=2011-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; He identified his lineage as [[Timurid dynasty|Timurid]] and [[Chagatai Khanate|Chaghatay-Turkic]], while his origin, milieu, training, and culture were steeped in [[Persian culture]] and so he was largely responsible for the fostering of this culture by his descendants, and for the expansion of [[Persianate society|Persian cultural influence]] in the [[Indian subcontinent]], with brilliant [[Persian literature|literary]], [[Persian art|artistic]], and historiographical results.&lt;ref name=&quot;Iranica&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Lehmann |first=F. |url=http://www.iranica.com/newsite/index.isc?Article=http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/unicode/v3f3/v3f3a066.html |title= Memoirs of Zehīr-ed-Dīn Muhammed Bābur |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopaedia Iranica]] |accessdate=2008-04-02 |quote=His origin, milieu, training, and culture were steeped in Persian culture and so Babur was largely responsible for the fostering of this culture by his descendants, the Mughals of India, and for the expansion of Persian cultural influence in the Indian subcontinent, with brilliant literary, artistic, and historiographical results. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert L.

==Overview==
===Babur's name===
Ẓahīr ud-Dīn Muḥammad ('''محمد ظهير الدين''', also known by his royal titles as ''al-ṣultānu 'l-ʿaẓam wa 'l-ḫāqān al-mukkarram pādshāh-e ghāzī''), is more commonly known by his nickname, ''Bābur'' ('''&lt;big&gt;بابر&lt;/big&gt;''').

According to Stephen Frederic Dale, the name ''Babur'' is derived from the Persian word ''babr'', meaning  &quot;tiger&quot;, a word that repeatedly appears in [[Ferdowsi|Firdawsī's]] [[Shahnameh|Shāhnāma]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Dale2004&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
An example from the section where Houshang, the son of Siamak is described:
ترا بود باید همی پیشرو
که من رفتنی‌ام تو سالار نو
پری و پلنگ انجمن کرد و شیر
ز درندگان گرگ و ببر دلیر
Shahnameh, the Moscow edition.&lt;/ref&gt; and had also been borrowed by the Turkic languages of Central Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Chisholm, Hugh (1910), The Encyclopedia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thumb, Albert, ''Handbuch des Sanskrit, mit Texten und Glossar'', German original, ed. C. Winter, 1953, [http://books.google.de/books?id=_kMeAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=babr+sanskrit&amp;dq=babr+sanskrit&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;pgis=1 Snippet, p.318]&lt;/ref&gt; This thesis is supported by the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland, explaining that the Turko-Mongol name ''Timur'' underwent a similar evolution, from the Sanskrit word ''cimara'' (&quot;iron&quot;) via a modified version ''*čimr'' to the final Turkicized version ''timür'', with ''-ür'' replacing ''-r'' due to the Turkish vowel harmony (hence ''babr'' → ''babür'').&lt;ref&gt;''Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain &amp; Ireland'', Cambridge University Press, 1972. [http://books.google.de/books?id=W_ssAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=babr+babur+tiger&amp;dq=babr+babur+tiger&amp;pgis=1 Snippet, p.104].&lt;/ref&gt;

| style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; | &quot;At that time the Chaghatái (descendants of [[Genghis Khan]]) were very rude and uncultured (''bázári''), and not refined (''buzurg'') as they are now; thus they found Zahir-ud-Din Muhammad difficult to pronounce, and for this reason gave him the name of Bábar. In the public prayers (''[[khutba]]'') and in royal mandates he is always styled 'Zahir-ud-Din Bábar Muhammad,' but he is best known by the name of Bábar Pádisháh.&quot;
|-
| style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; |—Babur's cousin, [[Mirza Mohammad Haydar|Mirzā Muḥammad Haydar]]&lt;ref name=&quot;tarikh&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Tarikh-i-Rashidi: A History of the Moghuls of Central Asia |others=Elias and Denison Ross (ed. and trans.) |year=1898, reprinted 1972 |isbn=0700700218 }} {{Google books|eikPAAAAYAAJ|Full text}}.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;
|}
Contradicting these views, W.M. Thackston argues that the name cannot be taken from ''babr'' and instead must be derived from a word that has evolved out of the Indo-European word for ''beaver'', pointing to the fact that the name is pronounced ''bāh-bor''&lt;ref name=&quot;baburnama&quot;/&gt; in both Persian and Turkic, similar to the Russian word for beaver (бобр - ''bobr'').

===Sources for the biography===
The main source for Babur's biography is a written account of his life, written by Babur himself. His memoirs are known as the ''[[Baburnama]]'' and are considered the first true [[autobiography]] in Islamic literature.
He wrote the ''Bāburnāma'' in [[Chagatai language|Chaghatai Turkic]], his mother-tongue, though his prose was highly Persianized in its sentence structure, morphology, and vocabulary.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dale2004&quot;&gt;{{cite book |first=Stephen Frederic |last=Dale |title=The garden of the eight paradises: Bābur and the culture of Empire in Central Asia, Afghanistan and India (1483-1530) |publisher=Brill |year=2004 |pages=15, 150 |isbn=9004137076 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The work gives a valuable impression of Babur's surrounding environment.&lt;ref name=&quot;baburnama&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title=The Baburnama: Memoirs of Babur, Prince and Emperor |publisher=Modern Library |isbn=0-375-76137-3 |year=2002 |author=Babur, Emperor of Hindustan |others=translated, edited and annotated by W.M.

====History of the text and translations====
The memoirs were originally much more extensive than they are now. The gaps in the text, particularly those between 1508 to 1519 and from 1520 to 1525, are likely the result of quires during a storm. A year before his death Babur was reworking parts of his memoirs in 1528-29. His son and successor Humāyūn knew Chaghatay well and read his father's memoirs. Babur corresponded with him in that language, correcting his spelling and commenting on his style. His grandson [[Akbar the Great|Akbar]] was enthroned at the age of fourteen when Humayun died in 1556. The young emperor was raised by the regent, [[Bayram Khan|Bayram Khān]], an Iranian statesman whose father and grandfather had joined Babur's service. Bayram Khān himself wrote poetry in Chaghatay and Persian. His son, Abdul-Rahim, was fluent in Chaghatay, Urdu, and Persian and composed in all three languages. Using Babur's own text, he translated the ''Bāburnāma'' into Persian. The Chaghatay original was last seen in the imperial library sometime between 1628 and 1638 during Shah Jahāngīr's reign.

Although Babur hailed from the [[Barlas]] tribe which was of [[Mongol]] origin, his tribe had embraced [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.eb.com/eb/article-524 Babur] at [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Persian culture]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Iranica&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=The Columbia Encyclopedia |title=Timurids |url=http://www.bartleby.com/65/ti/Timurids.html |edition=6th Ed. |publisher=[[Columbia University]] |location=New York |accessdate=2006-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For more information about the medieval Turko-Persian society of Central Asia and Iran, see [[Turko-Persian Tradition]] and [[Persianate society]].&lt;/ref&gt; converted to [[Islam]] and resided in [[Turkestan]] and [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]]. His mother tongue was the [[Chaghatai language]] (known to Babur as ''Turkī'', &quot;Turkic&quot;) and he was equally at home in [[Persian language|Persian]], the ''[[lingua franca]]'' of the Timurid elite.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-32175 Iran: The Timurids and Turkmen] at [[Encyclopædia Britannica]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Hence Babur, though nominally a Mongol (or ''Moghul'' in Persian language), drew much of his support from the local Turkic and Iranian peoples of Central Asia, and his army was diverse in its ethnic makeup, including [[Tājik people|Tajiks]] (''[[Sart]]s'' as called by Babur),&lt;ref name=&quot;baburnama&quot; /&gt; [[Pashtun people|Pashtuns]] (''[[Afghan (name)|Afghans]]''), [[Arabs]], as well as Barlas and Chaghatayid Turco-Mongols from Central Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Central Asia in Historical Perspective |last=Manz |first=Beatrice Forbes |chapter=The Symbiosis of Turk and Tajik |publisher=Boulder, Colorado &amp; Oxford |year=1994 |page=58 |accessdate=2006-11-10 |isbn=0-8133-3638-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Babur's army also included [[Qizilbash|Qizilbāsh]]{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} fighters, a militant religious order of [[Shi'a Islam|Shi'a]] ''[[Sufism|Sufis]]'' from [[Safavid Empire|Safavid Persia]] who later became one of the most influential groups in the Mughal court.

Babur is said to have been extremely strong and physically fit. He could allegedly carry two men, one on each of his shoulders, and then climb slopes on the run, just for exercise. Legend holds that Babur swam across every major [[river]] he encountered, including twice across the [[Ganges River]] in [[North India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Elliot |first=Henry Miers |others=John Dowson (ed.) |title=The History of India, as Told by Its Own Historians |chapter=The Muhammadan Period |chapterurl=http://persian.packhum.org/persian//pf?file=80201014&amp;ct=56 |accessdate=2008-04-02 |date=1867–1877 |publisher=Trubner |location=London |quote=...and on the same journey, he swam twice across the Ganges, as he said he had done with every other river he had met with. }}&lt;/ref&gt; His passions could be equally strong.

Though religion had a central place in his life, Babur also approvingly quoted a line of poetry by one of his contemporaries: ''&quot;I am drunk, officer. Punish me when I am sober.&quot;'' Babur related that one of his uncles ''&quot;was addicted to vice and debauchery. He kept a lot of catamites. In his realm, wherever there was a comely, beardless youth, he did everything he could to turn him into one. During his time this vice was so widespread, that to keep catamites was considered a virtue.&quot;

He gave up drinking alcohol only two years before his death for health reasons, and demanded that his court do the same. But he did not stop chewing narcotic preparations, and did not lose his sense of irony. He wrote:&lt;ref&gt;Pope, Hugh (2005).

In 1495, At only twelve years of age, Babur obtained his first power position, succeeding his father as ruler of [[Farghana]], in present-day [[Uzbekistan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Other Routes: 1500 Years of African and Asian Travel Writing |pages=162 |last=Khair |first=Tabish |isbn=1-904955-11-8 |publisher=Signal Books |date=2006-01-06 |accessdate=2006-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; His uncles were relentless in their attempts to dislodge him from this position as well as many of his other territorial possessions to come.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Domesticity and Power in the Early Mughal World |last=Lal |first=Ruby |isbn=0-521-85022-3 |date=2005-09-25 |accessdate=2006-11-08 |pages=69 |quote=It was over these possessions, provinces controlled by uncles, or cousins of varying degrees, that Babur fought with close and distant relatives for much of his life.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Babur spent a large portion of his life shelterless and in [[exile]], aided only by friends and [[peasant]]s. In 1497, Babur attacked the Uzbek city of [[Samarkand]] and after seven months succeeded in capturing the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;Afghanistan&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title= Afghanistan: A Short History of Its People and Politics |last=Ewans |first=Martin |isbn=0-06-050508-7 |publisher=HarperCollins |month=September | year=2002 |pages=26–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, a rebellion amongst nobles back home approximately 350&amp;nbsp;kilometers (200&amp;nbsp;miles) away robbed him of [[Farghana Valley|Farghana]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Afghanistan&quot; /&gt; As he was marching to recover it, Babur's troops deserted in Samarkand, leaving him with neither Samarkand nor Fergana.

By 1501, he was ready again to regain control of Samarkand, but was shortly thereafter defeated by his most formidable enemy, [[Muhammad Shaybani]], [[Khan (title)|khan]] of the [[Uzbeks]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Afghanistan&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://depts.washington.edu/silkroad/texts/babur/babur1.html |quote=After being driven out of Samarkand in 1501 by the Uzbek Shaibanids... |title=The Memoirs of Babur |accessdate=2006-11-08 |publisher=Walter Chapin Center for the Humanities at the University of Washington |work=Silk Road Seattle}}&lt;/ref&gt; Samarkand, his lifelong obsession, was lost again. Escaping with a small band of followers from Fergana, for three years Babur concentrated on building up a strong army, recruiting widely amongst the Tajiks of [[Badakhshan]] in particular. In 1504, he was able to cross the snowy [[Hindu Kush]] mountains and capture [[Kabul]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Afghanistan&quot; /&gt; from the [[Arghun Dynasty|Arghunids]], who were forced to retreat to [[Kandahar]]. With this move, he gained a wealthy new kingdom and re-established his fortunes and assumed the title of ''[[Padshah]]''. In the following year, Babur united with [[Husayn Bayqarah]] of [[Herat]], a fellow [[Timurid Dynasty|Timurid]] and distant relative, against the [[usurper]] Muhammad Shaybani.&lt;ref name=&quot;perspect&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Perspectives on Persian Painting: Illustrations to Amir Khusrau's Khamsah |last=Brend |first=Barbara |date=2002-12-20 |isbn=0-7007-1467-7 |publisher=Routledge (UK) |pages=188 |accessdate=2006-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the death of Husayn Bayqarah in 1506 delayed that venture. Babur instead occupied his allies' city of [[Herat]], spending just two months there before being forced to leave due to diminishing resources.&lt;ref name=&quot;perspect&quot; /&gt; Nevertheless, he marvelled at the intellectual abundance in Herat, which he stated was &quot;filled with learned and matched men.&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Sewing Circles of Herat: A Personal Voyage Through Afghanistan |last=Lamb |first=Christina |pages=153 |isbn=0-06-050527-3 |publisher=HarperCollins |month=February | year=2004 |accessdate=2006-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and became acquainted with the work of the [[Uzbek people|Uzbek]] poet [[Mir Ali Shir Nava'i]], who encouraged the use of [[Chagatai language|Chagatai]] as a [[literary language]].

A brewing rebellion finally induced him to return to [[Kabul]] from [[Herat]], [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]]. He prevailed on that occasion, but two years later a revolt among some of his leading generals drove him out of Kabul. Escaping with very few companions, Babur soon returned to the city, capturing Kabul again and regaining the allegiance of the rebels. [[Muhammad Shaybani]] was defeated and killed by [[Ismail I]], Shah of [[Shia Islam|Shia]] [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid Persia]], in 1510,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Merriam-Webster's Encyclopedia of World Religions |last=Doniger |first=Wendy |isbn=0-87779-044-2 |month=September | year=1999 |pages=539 |publisher=Merriam-Webster |accessdate=2006-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Babur used this opportunity to attempt to reconquer his ancestral Timurid territories. Over the following few years, Babur and [[Shah]] Ismail would form a partnership in an attempt to take over parts of [[Central Asia]]. In return for Ismail's assistance, Babur permitted the Safavids to act as a [[suzerainty|suzerain]] over him and his followers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Islamic World in Ascendancy: From the Arab Conquests to the Siege in Vienna |last=Sicker |first=Martin |isbn=0-275-96892-8 |month=August | year=2000 |pages=189 |accessdate=2006-11-10 |quote=Ismail was quite prepared to lend his support to the displaced Timurid prince, Zahir ad-Din Babur, who offered to accept Safavid suzerainty in return for help in regaining control of Transoxiana.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, Shah Ismail reunited Babur with his sister Khānzāda, who had been imprisoned by and forced to marry the recently deceased [[Muhammad Shaybani|Shaybani]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=History of the Rise of the Mahomedan Power in India Till the Year A.

Coins were to be struck in Ismail's name, and the [[Khutba]] at the Mosque was also to be read in his name. In effect, Babur was supposed to be holding Samarkand as a vassal territory for the Persian Shah, though in Kabul, coins and the Khutba would remain in Babur's name.

With this assistance, Babur marched on Bukhara, where his army were apparently treated as liberators, Babur having greater legitimacy as a Timurid, unlike the Uzbegs. Towns and villages are said to have emptied in order to greet him, and aid and feed his army. At this point, Babur dismissed his Persian aide, believing them no longer needed. In October 1511 Babur made a triumphant re-entry into Samarkand, ending a ten year absence. Bazaars were draped in gold, and again villages and towns emptied to greet the liberator.

===Conquest of the Lodi Empire===
{{Main|Lodi dynasty|Delhi Sultanate}}
{{Citations missing|date=August 2008}}
Writing in retrospect, Babur suggested his failure in attaining Samarkand was the greatest gift Allah bestowed him.  Babur had now resigned all hopes of recovering Fergana, and although he dreaded an invasion from the Uzbeks to his West, his attention increasingly turned towards India and its lands in the east, especially the rich lands of the [[Delhi Sultanate]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Economist]]'', &quot;[http://www.economist.com/node/17723207 Babu, the First Moghul Emperor:  Wine and Tulips in Kabul]&quot;, 16 December 2010, pp. 80-82.&lt;/ref&gt;

Babur claimed to be the true and rightful Monarch of the lands of the [[Lodi dynasty]]. He believed himself the rightful heir to the throne of [[Timur]], and it was Timur who had originally left [[Khizr Khan]] in charge of his vassal in the Punjab, who became the leader, or Sultan, of the [[Delhi Sultanate]], founding the [[Sayyid dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;Francis Robinson, The Mughal Emperors and the Islamic Dynasties of India, Iran and Central Asia, Page 103&lt;/ref&gt;
The Sayyid dynasty, however, had been ousted by [[Ibrahim Lodi]], a [[Ghilzai]] [[Pashtuns|Afghan]], and Babur wanted it returned to the Timurids.  Indeed, while actively building up the troop numbers for an invasion of the [[Punjab region|Punjab]] he sent a request to Ibrahim; &quot;I sent him a [[Northern Goshawk|goshawk]] and asked for the countries which from old had depended on the Turk,&quot; the 'countries' referred to were the lands of the Delhi Sultanate.

Following the unsurprising reluctance of Ibrahim to accept the terms of this &quot;offer,&quot; and though in no hurry to launch an actual invasion, Babur made several preliminary incursions and also seized Kandahar — a strategic city if he was to fight off attacks on Kabul from the west while he was occupied in India - from the Arghunids. The siege of Kandahar, however, lasted far longer than anticipated, and it was only almost three years later that Kandahar and its Citadel (backed by enormous natural features) were taken, and that minor assaults in India recommenced. During this series of skirmishes and battles an opportunity for a more extended expedition presented itself.

Upon entering the Punjab plains, Babur's chief allies, namely ''Langar Khan Niazi'' advised Babur to engage the powerful [[Janjua|Janjua Rajputs]] to join his conquest. The tribe's rebellious stance to the throne of Delhi was well known. Upon meeting their chiefs, ''Malik Hast (Asad)'' and ''Raja Sanghar Khan'', Babur made mention of the Janjua's popularity as traditional rulers of their kingdom and their ancestral support for his patriarch [[Timur|Amir Timur]] during his conquest of Hind.
Babur aided them in defeating their enemies, the [[Gakhars]] in 1521, thus cementing their alliance. Babur employed them as Generals in his campaign for [[Delhi]], the conquer of ''Rana Sanga'' and the conquest of India.

The section of Babur's memoirs covering the period between 1508 and 1519 is missing. During these years Shah [[Ismail I]] suffered a large defeat when his large cavalry-based army was obliterated at the [[Battle of Chaldiran]] by the [[Ottoman Empire]]'s new weapon, the [[matchlock|matchlock musket]]. Both Shah Ismail and Babur, it appears, were swift in acquiring this new technology for themselves.  Somewhere during these years Babur introduced [[matchlock]]s into his army, and allowed an [[Ottoman Turks|Ottoman]], Ustad Ali, to train his troops, who were then known as Matchlockmen, in their use.  Babur's memoirs give accounts of battles where the opposition forces mocked his troops, never having seen a gun before, because of the noise they made and the way no arrows, spears, etc. appeared to come from the weapon when fired.

These guns allowed small armies to make large gains on enemy territory. Small parties of skirmishers who had been dispatched simply to test enemy positions and tactics, were making inroads into India. Babur, however, had survived two revolts, one in Kandahar and another in Kabul, and was careful to pacify the local population after victories, following local traditions and aiding widows and orphans.

====First battle of Panipat====
{{Main|First battle of Panipat}}
[[File:Schlacht von Panipat.jpg|thumb|upright|[[First battle of Panipat]]]]
However, while the Timurids were united, the Lodi armies were far from unified. [[Ibrahim Lodi|Ibrahim]] was widely detested, even amongst his nobles, and it was several of his Afghan nobles who were to invite Babur's intervention. Babur assembled a 12,000-man army, and advanced into India. This number actually increased as Babur advanced, as members of the local population joined the invading army. The first major clash between the two sides was fought in late February 1526.  Babur's son, [[Humayun]] (then aged 17), led the Timurid army into battle against the first of Ibrahim's advance parties.  Humayun's victory was harder fought than the previous skirmishes, but it was still a decisive victory. Over one hundred [[prisoners of war]] were captured along with around eight [[war elephants]]. However, unlike after previous battles, these prisoners were not bonded or freed; by decree from Humayun, they were shot. In his memoirs, Babur recorded that &quot;Ustad Ali-quli and the matchlockmen were ordered to shoot all the prisoners, by way of example; this had been Humayun's first affair, his first experience of battle; it was an excellent omen!&quot;  This is perhaps the earliest example of [[execution by firing squad]].

Ibrahim Lodi advanced against him with 100,000 soldiers and 100 elephants; and though Babur's army had grown, it was still less than half the size of his opponents, possibly as few as 25,000 men. This was to be their main engagement, the [[First battle of Panipat]], and was fought on 21 April 1526. Ibrahim Lodi was slain and his army was routed; Babur quickly took possession of both Delhi and Agra. That very day Babur ordered Humayun to ride to Agra (Ibrahim's former capital) and secure its national treasures and resources from looting. Humayun found the family of the Raja of Gwalior there — the Raja himself having died at Panipat — sheltering from the invaders, fearing the dreadful nature of the 'Mongols' from the stories that preceded their arrival. After their safety was guaranteed they gave Humayun their family's most valuable jewel, a very large diamond, which some believe to be the diamond which came to be called the ''[[Koh-i-Noor]]'' or &quot;Mountain of Light'. It is thought that they did this to retain their Kingdom. Whether it was because of the gift or not, the family remained the rulers of Gwalior, though now under their new rulers the Timurids.

Babur, meanwhile, marched onward to Delhi reaching it three days after the battle. He celebrated his arrival with a festival on the [[river Jumna]], and remained there at least until Friday ([[Jum'ah]]), when Muslim congregational prayers were said and he heard the [[Khutba]], (sermon), read in his name in the ''[[Friday Mosque|Jama Masjid]]'', a sign of the assumption of sovereignty. He then marched to Agra to join Humayun. Upon arrival Babur was presented with the fabulous diamond, and Babur reports that &quot;I just gave it back to him&quot;, adding, &quot;an expert in jewels said its value would provide two and a half days food for the whole world.&quot;

====Battles with the Rajputs====
[[File:Image of babur.jpg|thumb|Babur as Emperor, receiving a [[courtier]]]]
Although master of Delhi and Agra, Babur records in his memoirs that he had sleepless nights because of continuing worries over Raja Hasan Khan, ''Mewatpatti'' (title, Lord of Mewat), the Khanzada ruler of Mewat, [[Rana Sanga]], the [[Rajput]] ruler of [[Mewar]].

In A.D. 1526 a new power appeared in India. Babar, who claimed to be the representative of Timur Lang, after winning the battle of Panipat, took possession of Dehli and Agra ; and determined that his enterprise should not be a mere raid like Timur's, but the foundation of a new and
lasting empire. Then it was that the Rajputs made their last great struggle for independence. They were led by Rana Sankha, a chief of Mewar, who invited the Mewatti chief, Hasan Khan, to aid the nation from which he had sprung in resisting the new horde of Musalmans from the north.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gazetteer of Ulwur&quot;&gt;Gazetteer of Ulwur&lt;/ref&gt;

The political position of Hasan Khan at this time was a very important one. Babar, in his autobiography, speaks of him as the prime mover in all the confusions and insurrections of the period. He had, he states, vainly shown Hasan Khan distinguished marks of favour, but the affections of the infidel lay all on the side of the natives i.e., the Hindus ( Indians ) ; and the propinquity of his country to Dehli, no doubt, made his opposition especially dangerous. Hasan Khan's seat at this time was at Ulwur, but local tradition says that he was originally established at Bahadarpur, eight miles from Ulwur.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gazetteer of Ulwur&quot;/&gt;

The Emperor Babur, speaking of Hasan Khan of Mewat, who was one of his opponents at the great battle of Khanwa, says that he &quot;had received the government of Mewat from his ancestors, who had governed it in uninterrupted succession for nearly 200 years.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Baber's Memoirs, pp. 368-69.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Emperor Babur, in his autobiography THE BABUR-NAMA, speaks
{{quote|Marching on from that ground, and after halting on two nights, we reached Biana. Countless numbers of the bodies of pagans and ''apostates'' who had fallen in their flight, lay on the road as far as Biana, indeed as far as ''Alur'' and ''Miwat''...

Near Dihli lies the Miwat country...Hasan Khan ''Miwati'' and his ancestors one after another had ruled it with absolute sway for a hundred years or two...|From ''The Babur-nama in English ( Memoirs of Babur) Translated from the original Turki Text OF Zahiru'd-din Muhammad Babur Padshah Ghazi  ''&lt;ref name=Babur/&gt;}}

''apostates'' - Babur so-calls both Hasan and his followers, presumably because they followed their race sympathies, as of Rajput origin, and fought against co-religionists. Though Hasan's subjects,Meos, were nominally Muhammadans, it appears that they practised some Hindu customs. For an account of Miwat, see Gazetteer of Ulvur (Alwar, Alur) by Major P. W. Powlett.&lt;ref name=Babur&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/baburnamainengli02babuuoft#page/n6/mode/1up|title=The Babur-nama in English (Memoirs of Babur)|year=1922}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Miwat'' - Alwar being in Miwat, Babur may mean that bodies were found beyond that town in the main portion of the Miwat country which lies north of Alwar towards Dihli.&lt;ref name=Babur/&gt;

''Miwati'' - This word appears to have been restricted in its use to the Khan-zadas of the ruling
house in Miwat, and was not used for their subjects, the Meos (Powlett I.e. Cap. I.,Gazetteeer of Ulwur). The uses of &quot; Miwati &quot; and &quot; Meo &quot; suggest something analogous with those of &quot;Chaghatai&quot; and &quot; Mughul &quot; in Babur's time. The resemblance includes mutual dislike and distrust (Powlett I.e.,Gazetter of Ulwur).&lt;ref name=Babur/&gt;

The Emperor Babur, in his autobiography THE BABUR-NAMA, speaks &quot;Hasan Khan of Miwat was enrolled in the list of the dead by the force of a matchlock (zarb-i-tufak) ; most of those headstrong chiefs of tribes were slain likewise, and ended their days by arrow and matchlock (tir u tufak).&quot;&lt;ref name=Babur/&gt;

The Rana Sankha escaped from [[Battle of Khanwa]]. He died in this year, not without suspicion of poison. &quot;aichimni khali qildim&quot;, a seeming equivalent for English, &quot;I poured out my spleen.&quot;&lt;ref name=Babur/&gt;

Baber says that the ancestors of his opponent Hasan Khan had governed Mewat in uninterrupted succession for nearly 200 years, and that Tejara was their capital.&lt;ref&gt;Babur's Memoirs, pp. 368-69.&lt;/ref&gt; In another place he calls him Raja Hasan Khan Mewati, an infidel, who was the prime mover and agitator in the insurrection against the Mughals.&lt;ref&gt;Babur's Memoirs, p. 335.&lt;/ref&gt; The title of Raja and the term &quot; infidel &quot; show that Baber was aware of Hasan Khan's Hindu descent, and the period of '* nearly 200 years&quot; most probably refers to the date when his ancestor became a Muhammadan in the reign of Firoz Shah between A.H. 752 and 790.&lt;ref&gt;Archaelogical Survey of India Reports&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rajput lords had, prior to Babur's intervention, succeeded in conquering some of the Sultanate's territory. They ruled an area directly to the southwest of Babur's new dominions, commonly known as [[Rajputana]] as well as fortified dominions in other parts of northern India. It was not a unified kingdom, but rather a confederacy of [[Principality|principalities]], under the informal suzerainty of Rana Sanga, head of the senior Rajput dynasty.

The Rajputs had possibly heard word of the heavy casualties inflicted by Lodi on Babur's forces, and believed that they could capture Delhi, and possibly all [[Hindustan]]. They hoped to bring it back into Hindu Rajput hands for the first time in almost three hundred and fifty years since [[Muhammad of Ghor|Sultan Shah-al Din Muhammad of Ghor]] defeated the Rajput [[Chauhan]] King [[Prithviraj III]] in 1192.

Furthermore, the Rajputs were well aware that there was dissent within the ranks of Babar's army. The hot Indian summer was upon them, and many troops wanted to return home to the cooler climes of [[Central Asia]]. The Rajputs' reputation for [[Courage|valour]] preceded them, and their superior numbers no doubt further contributed to the desire of Babur's army to retreat.According to Babur's own calculations the potential strength of the Rajput army was much larger than that deployed by the Lodis at [[Panipat]].  Babur resolved to make this an extended battle, and decided to push further into India, into lands never previously claimed by the Timurids. He needed his troops to defeat the Rajputs.

Despite the unwillingness of his troops to engage in further warfare, Babur was convinced he could overcome the Rajputs and gain complete control over Hindustan.  He made great [[propaganda]] of the fact that for the first time he was to battle non-Muslims, the ''[[Kafir]]'', to the extent of taking a vow to abstain from drinking (a common fraction among his people) for the rest of his life to win divine favour, and declared the war against, [[Rana Sanga]].

[[File:Kabul Baghe Babur tomb.jpg|thumb|Tomb site of Babur inside the [[Bagh-e Babur]] (Babur Gardens) in [[Kabul]], [[Afghanistan]].]]
After Babar fell seriously ill, Humayun was told of a plot by the senior nobles of Babur's court to bypass the leader's sons and appoint [[Mahdi Khwaja]], Babur's sister's husband, as his successor. He rushed to Agra and arrived there to see his father was well enough again, although Mahdi Khwaja had lost all hope of becoming ruler after arrogantly exceeding his authority during Babur's illness. Upon his arrival in Agra it was Humayun himself who fell ill, and was close to dying.

Babar is said to have circled the sick-bed, crying to God to take his life and not his son's.  The traditions that follow this tell that Babur soon fell ill with a fever and Humayun began to get better again. His last words apparently being to his son, Humayun, &quot;Do nothing against your brothers, even though they may deserve it.&quot;

He died at the age of 47 on {{OldStyleDate|January 5|1531|26 December 1530}}, and was succeeded by his eldest son, [[Humayun]]. Though he wished to be buried in his favourite garden in Kabul, a city he had always loved, he was first buried in a [[Mausoleum]] in the capital city of [[Agra]]. Roughly nine years later his wishes were fulfilled by [[Sher Shah Suri]]{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} and Babur was buried in [[Bagh-e Babur]] (Babur Gardens) in Kabul, [[Afghanistan]]. The inscription on his tomb reads (in [[Persian Language|Persian]]):
{{bquote|If there is a paradise on earth, it is this, it is this, it is this!&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Studies in Mughal History |last=Agrawal |first=Ashvini |isbn=81-208-2326-5 |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publisher |date=1983-12-01 |accessdate=2006-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Babur is considered a national hero in [[Uzbekistan]] and [[Kyrgyzstan]],&lt;ref&gt;Dust in the Wind: Retracing Dharma Master Xuanzang's Western Pilgrimage By 經典雜誌編著, Zhihong Wang, pg. 121&lt;/ref&gt; and is held in high esteem in Afghanistan where he is buried. In October 2005 the [[Pakistan military]] developed the [[Babur (cruise missile)]], named in honour of him.

===Impact on architecture===
[[File:babri rearview.jpg|thumb|A view of the [[Babri Mosque]], before its demolition by radical Hindu organizations. The Mosque is believed to have been commissioned by Babur.]]
Babar travelled the country, taking in much of the land and its scenery, and began building a series of structures which mixed the pre-existing Hindu intricacies of carved detail with the traditional Muslim designs used by Persians and Turks. He described with awe the buildings in Chanderi, a village carved from rock, and the palace of [[Raja Man Singh]] in [[Gwalior]]. He, was, however, disgusted by the [[Jain]] &quot;deities&quot; carved into the rock face below the fortress at Gwalior. Fortunately, the statues were not destroyed entirely, rather the faces and genitalia of the offending pieces were removed. (Modern sculptors have restored the faces).

To remind himself of the lands he had left behind, Babur began a process of creating exquisite gardens in every palace and province, where he would often sit shaded from the fierce Indian sun. He tried to recreate the gardens of Kabul, which he believed were the most beautiful in the world, and in one of which he would eventually be buried. Almost thirty pages of Babur's memoirs are taken up describing the [[Fauna and flora of India|fauna and flora]] of his Hindustan.

===Babri mosque===

Babur is popularly believed to have built [[Babri Masjid]] in [[Ayodhya]].However from the three inscriptions which once adorned the surface of the mosque it becomes apparent that the mosque was constructed during his reign on the orders of [[Mir Baqi]], who was one of the generals of Babur's forces sent towards this region. In 2003, The Archaeological Survey of India was asked to conduct a more in-depth study and an excavation to ascertain the type of structure that was beneath the rubble of babari masjid.&lt;ref&gt;Ratnagar, Shereen (2004) &quot;CA Forum on Anthropology in Public: Archaeology at the Heart of a Political Confrontation: The Case of Ayodhya&quot; ''Current Anthropology'' 45(2): pp. 239-259, p. 239&lt;/ref&gt;  The summary of the ASI report &lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20050323101829/http://www.the-week.com/23sep07/events1.htm Prasannan, R.

'''Bernard of Clairvaux''', [[Cistercians|O.Cist]] (1090 – August 20, 1153) was a [[French people|French]] [[abbot]] and the primary builder of the reforming [[Cistercian]] order.

After the death of his mother, Bernard sought admission into the Cistercian order. Three years later, he was sent to found a new abbey at an isolated clearing in a glen known as the ''Val d'Absinthe'', about 15&amp;nbsp;km southeast of [[Bar-sur-Aube]]. According to tradition, Bernard founded the monastery on 25 June 1115, naming it ''Claire Vallée'', which evolved into ''Clairvaux.'' There Bernard would preach an immediate faith, in which the intercessor was the [[Virgin Mary]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} In the year 1128, Bernard assisted at the [[Council of Troyes]], at which he traced the outlines of the Rule of the [[Knights Templar]], who soon became the ideal of Christian nobility.

On the death of [[Pope Honorius II]] a schism broke out in the Church. [[Louis VI of France]] convened a national council of the French bishops at [[Étampes]], and Bernard was chosen to judge between the rivals for pope. In 1139, Bernard assisted at the [[Second Council of the Lateran]].
Bernard denounced the teachings of [[Peter Abelard]] to the Pope, who called a council at Sens in 1141 to settle the matter. Bernard soon saw one of his disciples, [[Pope Eugenius III|Bernard of Pisa]], elected Pope. Having previously helped end the schism within the Church, Bernard was now called upon to combat heresy. In June 1145, Bernard traveled in Southern France and his preaching there helped strengthen support against heresy.

Following the Christian defeat at the [[Siege of Edessa]], the Pope commissioned Bernard to preach the [[Second Crusade]]. The last years of Bernard's life were saddened by the failure of the crusaders, the entire responsibility for which was thrown upon him. Bernard died at age 63, after 40 years spent in the cloister. He was the first Cistercian monk placed on the [[calendar of saints]], and was [[canonized]] by [[Pope Alexander III]] on 18 January 1174. [[Pope Pius VIII]] bestowed upon him the title &quot;[[Doctor of the Church]]&quot;.

==Early life (1090–1113)==
Bernard's parents were Tescelin, lord of [[Fontaine-lès-Dijon|Fontaines]], and Aleth of Montbard, both belonging to the highest nobility of [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]]. Bernard was the third of a family of seven children, six of whom were sons. At the age of nine years, Bernard was sent to school at [[Châtillon-sur-Seine]], run by the [[secular canons]] of Saint-Vorles. Bernard had a great taste for literature and devoted himself for some time to poetry. His success in his studies won the admiration of his teachers. Bernard wanted to excel in literature in order to take up the study of the [[Bible]]. He had a special devotion to the [[Blessed Virgin Mary (Roman Catholic)|Virgin Mary]], and he would later write several works about the [[Queen of Heaven]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cedis&quot; /&gt;

[[File:Fra bartolomeo 02 Vision of St Bernard with Sts Benedict and John the Evangelist.jpg|thumb|left|''The Vision of St Bernard'', by [[Fra Bartolommeo]], c. 1504 ([[Uffizi]]).]]
Bernard would expand upon [[Anselm of Canterbury]]'s role in transmuting the sacramentally ritual Christianity of the [[Early Middle Ages]] into a new, more personally held faith, with the life of Christ as a model and a new emphasis on the Virgin Mary. In opposition to the rational approach to divine understanding that the [[scholastics]] adopted, Bernard would preach an immediate faith, in which the intercessor was the Virgin Mary.
Bernard played the leading role in the development of the cult of the Virgin, which is one of the most important manifestations of the popular piety of the twelfth century. In early medieval thought, the Virgin Mary had played a minor role, and it was only with the rise of emotional Christianity in the eleventh century that she became the prime intercessor for humanity with the deity.&lt;ref&gt;Cantor (1993) p.341.&lt;/ref&gt;
Bernard was only nineteen years of age when his mother died. During his youth, he did not escape trying temptations and around this time he thought of retiring from the world and living a life of solitude and prayer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bunson 1998 p.129&quot;&gt;Bunson (1998) p.129.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1098, Saint [[Robert of Molesme]] had founded [[Cîteaux Abbey]], near [[Dijon]], with the purpose of restoring the [[Rule of St Benedict]] in all its rigour. Returning to Molesme, he left the government of the new abbey to Saint [[Alberic of Cîteaux|Alberic]], who died in the year 1109. In 1113, Saint [[Stephen Harding]] had just succeeded him as third [[Abbot of Cîteaux]] when Bernard and thirty other young noblemen of Burgundy sought admission into the [[Cistercians|Cistercian]] order.&lt;ref&gt;McManners (1990) p.204.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abbot of Clairvaux (1113–28)==
[[Image:Jorg Breu Sr St Bernhard Zwettl.jpg|thumb|Bernard exorcising a possession, altarpiece by [[Jörg Breu the Elder]], c. 1500.]]
The little community of reformed [[Benedictines]] at Cîteaux, which would have so profound an influence on Western [[monasticism]], grew rapidly. Three years later, Bernard was sent with a band of twelve monks to found a new house at Vallée d'Absinthe, in the [[Diocese of Langres]]. This Bernard named Claire Vallée, or Clairvaux, on June 25, 1115, and the names of Bernard and Clairvaux would soon become inseparable.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bunson 1998 p.129&quot;/&gt; During the absence of the [[Bishop of Langres]], Bernard was blessed as [[abbot]] by [[William of Champeaux]], [[Bishop of Châlons-sur-Marne]]. From that moment a strong friendship sprang up between the abbot and the bishop, who was professor of theology at [[Notre Dame of Paris]], and the founder of the [[Abbey of St. Victor, Paris|Abbey of St. Victor]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cedis&quot;&gt;{{ws|&quot;[[s:Catholic Encyclopedia (1913)/St. Bernard of Clairvaux|St Bernard of Clairvaux]]&quot; in the 1913 &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The beginnings of [[Clairvaux Abbey]] were trying and painful. The regime was so austere that Bernard became ill, and only the influence of his friend William of Champeaux and the authority of the General Chapter could make him mitigate the austerities. The monastery, however, made rapid progress. Disciples flocked to it in great numbers and put themselves under the direction of Bernard. His father and all his brothers entered Clairvaux as to pursue religious life, leaving only Humbeline, his sister, in the secular world. She, with the consent of her husband, soon took the veil in the [[Benedictine]] [[nunnery]] of [[Jully-les-Nonnains]]. [[Gerard of Clairvaux]], Bernard's older brother, became the [[Obedientiaries|cellarer]] of Citeaux. The abbey became too small for its members and it was necessary to send out bands to found new houses. In 1118, [[Trois-Fontaines Abbey]] was founded in the [[Diocese of Châlons]], in 1119, [[Fontenay Abbey]] in the [[Diocese of Autun]] and in 1121, [[Foigny Abbey]] near [[Vervins]], in the [[Diocese of Laon]]. In addition to these victories, Bernard also had his trials. During an absence from Clairvaux, the Grand Prior of Cluny went to Clairvaux and enticed away Bernard's cousin, [[Robert of Châtillon]]. This was the occasion of the longest and most emotional of Bernard's letters.&lt;ref name=&quot;cedis&quot; /&gt;

[[Image:Dehio 212 Cluny.jpg|thumb|left|The abbey of Cluny as it would have looked in Bernard's time.]]&lt;!--not sure why this pic is here, as the design of this church has little or nothing to do with this particular article--&gt;
In the year 1119, Bernard was present at the first general chapter of the order convoked by Stephen of Cîteaux. Though not yet 30 years old, Bernard was listened to with the greatest attention and respect, especially when he developed his thoughts upon the revival of the primitive spirit of regularity and fervour in all the monastic orders. It was this general chapter that gave definitive form to the constitutions of the order and the regulations of the ''&quot;Charter of Charity&quot;'' which [[Pope Callixtus II]] confirmed December 23, 1119. In 1120, Bernard authored his first work ''&quot;De Gradibus Superbiae et Humilitatis&quot;'' and his homilies which he entitled ''&quot;De Laudibus Mariae.&quot;'' The monks of the [[abbey of Cluny]] were unhappy to see Cîteaux take the lead rôle among the religious orders of the Roman Catholic Church. For this reason, the [[Black Monks]] attempted to make it appear that the rules of the new order were impracticable. At the solicitation of William of St. Thierry, Bernard defended the order by publishing his ''&quot;Apology&quot;'' which was divided into two parts. In the first part, he proved himself innocent of the charges of Cluny and in the second he gave his reasons for his counterattacks. He protested his profound esteem for the Benedictines of Cluny whom he declared he loved equally as well as the other religious orders. [[Peter the Venerable]], [[Abbot of Cluny]], answered Bernard and assured him of his great admiration and sincere friendship. In the meantime Cluny established a reform, and [[Abbot Suger]], the minister of [[Louis VI of France]], was converted by the ''Apology'' of Bernard. He hastened to terminate his worldly life and restore discipline in his monastery. The zeal of Bernard  extended to the bishops, the clergy, and lay people. Bernard's letter to the [[Archbishop of Sens]] was seen as a real treatise, ''&quot;De Officiis Episcoporum.&quot;'' About the same time he wrote his work on ''Grace and Free Will''.&lt;ref name=&quot;cedis&quot; /&gt;

==Doctor of the Church (1128–46)==
{{Christian Mysticism }}
In the year 1128, Bernard participated in the [[Council of Troyes]], which had been convoked by [[Pope Honorius II]], and was presided over by [[Matthew of Albano|Cardinal Matthew]], [[Bishop of Albano]]. The purpose of this council was to settle certain disputes of the [[Bishop of Paris|bishops of Paris]], and regulate other matters of the [[Church of France]]. The bishops made Bernard secretary of the council, and charged him with drawing up the synodal statutes. After the council, the [[Bishop of Verdun]] was deposed. It was at this council that Bernard traced the outlines of the Rule of the [[Knights Templar]] who soon became the ideal of Christian nobility. He later praised them in his ''&quot;[[De Laude Novae Militiae]]&quot;.''&lt;ref&gt;Durant (1950) p.593.&lt;/ref&gt;

Again reproaches arose against Bernard and he was denounced, even in Rome. He was accused of being a monk who meddled with matters that did not concern him. [[Cardinal Harmeric]], on behalf of the pope, wrote Bernard a sharp letter of remonstrance stating, &quot;It is not fitting that noisy and troublesome frogs should come out of their marshes to trouble the Holy See and the cardinals.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;cedis&quot; /&gt;

Bernard answered the letter by saying that, if he had assisted at the council, it was because he had been dragged to it by force. In his response Bernard wrote,

{{quote|Now illustrious Harmeric if you so wished, who would have been more capable of freeing me from the necessity of assisting at the council than yourself? Forbid those noisy troublesome frogs to come out of their holes, to leave their marshes . . . Then your friend will no longer be exposed to the accusations of pride and presumption.&lt;ref name=&quot;cedis&quot; /&gt;}}

This letter made a positive impression on Harmeric, and in the Vatican.

===Schism===
Bernard's influence was soon felt in provincial affairs. He defended the rights of the Church against the encroachments of kings and princes, and recalled to their duty [[Henri Sanglier]], Archbishop of Sens and [[Stephen of Senlis]], Bishop of Paris. On the death of [[Pope Honorius II]], which occurred on February 14, 1130, a schism broke out in the Church by the election of two popes, [[Pope Innocent II]] and [[Antipope Anacletus II|Pope Anacletus II]]. Innocent II, having been banished from Rome by Anacletus, took refuge in France. King Louis VI convened a national council of the French bishops at [[Étampes]], and Bernard, summoned there by consent of the bishops, was chosen to judge between the rival popes. He decided in favour of Innocent II. This caused the Pope to be recognized by all the great powers. He then went with him into Italy and reconciled [[Pisa]] with [[Genoa]], and [[Milan]] with the Pope. The same year Bernard was again at the [[Council of Reims]] at the side of Innocent II. He then went to [[Aquitaine]] where he succeeded for the time in detaching [[William X of Aquitaine]], [[Count of Poitiers]], from the cause of Anacletus.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bunson 1998 p.129&quot;/&gt;
[[Image:Bernhard von Clairvaux (Initiale-B).jpg|thumb|left|St Bernard in a medieval [[illuminated manuscript]]]]

In 1132, Bernard accompanied Innocent II into Italy, and at Cluny the Pope abolished the dues which Clairvaux used to pay to that abbey. This action gave rise to a quarrel between the [[Cistercians|White Monks]] and the Black Monks which lasted 20 years. In May of that year, the Pope supported by the army of Emperor [[Lothair III, Holy Roman Emperor|Lothair III]], entered Rome, but Lothair, feeling himself too weak to resist the partisans of Anacletus, retired beyond the Alps, and Innocent sought refuge in Pisa in September 1133. Bernard had returned to France in June, and was continuing the work of peacemaking which he had commenced in 1130. Towards the end of 1134, he made a second journey into Aquitaine, where William X had relapsed into schism. Bernard invited William to the Mass which he celebrated in the Church of La Couldre. At the [[Eucharist]], he &quot;admonished the Duke not to despise God as he did His servants&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;cedis&quot; /&gt; William yielded and the schism ended. Bernard went again to Italy, where [[Roger II of Sicily]] was endeavouring to withdraw the Pisans from their allegiance to Innocent. He recalled the city of Milan to obedience to the Pope as they had followed the deposed [[Anselm V, Archbishop of Milan]]. For this, he was offered, and he refused, the [[Archbishop of Milan|Archbishopric of Milan]]. He then returned to Clairvaux. Believing himself at last secure in his cloister, Bernard devoted himself with renewed vigour to the composition of the works which would win for him the title of &quot;[[Doctor of the Church]]&quot;. He wrote at this time his sermons on the ''&quot;[[Song of Songs]]&quot;.'' In 1137 he was again forced to leave his solitude by order of the Pope to put an end to the quarrel between Lothair and Roger of Sicily. At the conference held at Palermo, Bernard succeeded in convincing Roger of the rights of Innocent II. He also silenced the final supporters who sustained the schism. Anacletus died of &quot;grief and disappointment&quot; in 1138, and with him the schism ended.&lt;ref name=&quot;cedis&quot; /&gt;

In 1139, Bernard assisted at the [[Second Council of the Lateran]], in which the surviving adherents of the schism were definitively condemned. About the same time, Bernard was visited at Clairvaux by [[Saint Malachy]], [[Primate of All Ireland]], and a very close friendship formed between them. Malachy wanted to become a Cistercian, but the Pope would not give his permission. Malachy would die at Clairvaux in 1148.&lt;ref name=&quot;cedis&quot; /&gt;

===Contest with Abelard===
Towards the close of the 11th century, a spirit of independence flourished within schools of [[philosophy]] and [[theology]]. This led for a time to the exaltation of human reason and rationalism. The movement found an ardent and powerful advocate in [[Peter Abelard]]. Abelard's treatise on the [[Trinity]] had been condemned as heretical in 1121, and he himself had thrown his book into the fire. However, Abelard continued to develop his teachings, which were controversial in some quarters. Bernard, informed of this by [[William of St-Thierry]], is said to have held a meeting with Abelard intended to persuade him to amend his writings, during which Abelard repented and promised to do so. But once out of Bernard's presence, he reneged.&lt;ref name=&quot;Evans 2000 p.115 - 123&quot;&gt;Evans (2000) p.115 – 123.&lt;/ref&gt; Bernard then denounced Abelard to the Pope and cardinals of the [[Roman Curia|Curia]]. Abelard sought a debate with Bernard, but Bernard initially declined, saying he didn't feel matters of such importance should be settled by logical analyses. Bernard's letters to William of St-Thierry also express his apprehension about confronting the preeminent logician. Abelard continued to press for a public debate, and made his challenge widely known, making it hard for Bernard to decline. In 1141, at the urgings of Abelard, the archbishop of Sens called a council of bishops, where Abelard and Bernard were to put their respective cases so Abelard would have a chance to clear his name.&lt;ref name=&quot;Evans 2000 p.115 - 123&quot;/&gt; Bernard lobbied the prelates on the evening before the debate, swaying many of them to his view. The next day, after Bernard made his opening statement, Abelard decided to retire without attempting to answer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Evans 2000 p.115 - 123&quot;/&gt; The council found in favour of Bernard and their judgment was confirmed by the Pope. Abelard submitted without resistance, and he retired to Cluny to live under the protection of Peter the Venerable, where he died two years later.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bunson 1998 p.129&quot;/&gt;

===Cistercian Order and heresy===
Bernard had occupied himself in sending bands of monks from his overcrowded monastery into Germany, Sweden, England, Ireland, Portugal, Switzerland, and Italy. Some of these, at the command of Innocent II, took possession of Three Fountains Abbey, from which [[Pope Eugenius III]] would be chosen in 1145. Pope Innocent II died in the year 1143. His two successors, [[Pope Celestine II]] and [[Pope Lucius II]], reigned only a short time, and then Bernard saw one of his disciples, Bernard of Pisa, and known thereafter as Eugenius III, raised to the [[Chair of Saint Peter]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bunson 1998 p.130&quot;&gt;Bunson (1998) p.130.&lt;/ref&gt; Bernard sent him, at the Pope's own request, various instructions which comprise the ''&quot;Book of Considerations,&quot;'' the predominating idea of which is that the reformation of the Church ought to commence with the sanctity of the Pope. Temporal matters are merely accessories,  the principals according to Bernard's work were piety, and meditation which was to precede action.&lt;ref&gt;McManners (1990) p.210.&lt;/ref&gt;

Having previously helped end the schism within the Church, Bernard was now called upon to combat heresy. [[Henry of Lausanne]], a former [[Cluny Abbey|Cluniac]] monk, had adopted the teachings of the Petrobrusians, followers of [[Peter of Bruys]] and spread them in a modified form after Peter's death.&lt;ref name=&quot;eb11&quot;&gt;{{cite book  | title =Henry of Lausanne  | work =Encyclopædia Britannica  | publisher =Encyclopædia Britannica  | year =1911  | url =  | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Henry of Lausanne's followers became known as Henricians. In June 1145, at the invitation of Cardinal [[Alberic of Ostia]], Bernard traveled in Southern France.&lt;ref&gt;McManners (1990) p.211.&lt;/ref&gt; His preaching, aided by his ascetic looks and simple attire, helped doom the new sects. Both the Henrician and the Petrobrusian faiths began to die out by the end of that year. Soon afterwards, Henry of Lausanne was arrested, brought before the [[Bishop of Toulouse]], and probably imprisoned for life. In a letter to the people of Toulouse, undoubtedly written at the end of 1146, Bernard calls upon them to extirpate the last remnants of the heresy. He also preached against the [[Catharism|Cathars]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bunson 1998 p.130&quot;/&gt;

==Second Crusade (1146–49)==
News came at this time from the [[Holy Land]] that alarmed [[Christendom]]. Christians had been defeated at the [[Siege of Edessa]] and most of the county had fallen into the hands of the [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuk Turks]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Riley-Smith 1991 p.48&quot;&gt;Riley-Smith (1991) p.48&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] and the other [[Crusader states]] were threatened with similar disaster. Deputations of the bishops of [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia|Armenia]] solicited aid from the Pope, and the King of France also sent ambassadors. The Pope commissioned Bernard to preach a [[Second Crusade]] and granted the same indulgences for it which [[Pope Urban II]] had accorded to the [[First Crusade]]&lt;!--what were they? 1st Crusade article doesn't mention--&gt;.&lt;ref name=&quot;d594&quot;&gt;Durant (1950) p.594.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Heiligenkreuz.Bernard of Clervaux.jpg|thumb|left|Bernard of Clairvaux, true effigy by [[Georg Andreas Wasshuber]] (1650–1732)]]
There was at first virtually no popular enthusiasm for the crusade as there had been in 1095. Bernard found it expedient to dwell upon the taking of the cross as a potent means of gaining absolution for sin and attaining grace. On 31 March, with King Louis present, he preached to an enormous crowd in a field at [[Vézelay]]. When Bernard was finished the crowd enlisted en masse; they supposedly ran out of cloth to make crosses. Bernard is said to have given his own outer garments to be cut up to make more.&lt;ref name=&quot;d594&quot; /&gt; Unlike the First Crusade, the new venture attracted Royalty, such as [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]], then Queen of France; [[Thierry of Alsace]], [[Count of Flanders]]; [[Henry I of Champagne|Henry]], the future [[Count of Champagne]]; Louis’ brother [[Robert I of Dreux]]; [[Alphonse I of Toulouse]]; [[William II of Nevers]]; [[William de Warenne, 3rd Earl of Surrey]]; [[Hugh VII of Lusignan]]; and numerous other nobles and bishops. But an even greater show of support came from the common people. Bernard wrote to the Pope a few days afterwards, &quot;Cities and castles are now empty. There is not left  one man to seven women, and everywhere there are widows to still living husbands.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;d594&quot; /&gt;

Bernard then passed into Germany, and the reported miracles which multiplied almost at his every step undoubtedly contributed to the success of his mission. [[Conrad III of Germany]] and his nephew [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]], received the cross from the hand of Bernard.&lt;ref name=&quot;Riley-Smith 1991 p.48&quot;/&gt; Pope Eugenius came in person to France to encourage the enterprise. As in the First Crusade, the preaching inadvertently led to attacks on [[Jews]]; a fanatical French monk named [[Radulphe]] was apparently inspiring massacres of Jews in the Rhineland, [[Cologne]], [[Mainz]], [[Worms, Germany|Worms]], and [[Speyer]], with Radulphe claiming Jews were not contributing financially to the rescue of the Holy Land. The [[Archbishop of Cologne]] and the [[Archbishop of Mainz]] were vehemently opposed to these attacks and asked Bernard to denounce them. This he did, but when the campaign continued, Bernard traveled from Flanders to Germany to deal with the problems in person. He then found Radulphe in Mainz and was able to silence him, returning him to his monastery.&lt;ref&gt;Durant (1950) p. 391.&lt;/ref&gt;

The last years of Bernard's life were saddened by the failure of the Second Crusade he had preached, the entire responsibility for which was thrown upon him.&lt;ref&gt;Bunson (1998) p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt; Bernard considered it his duty to send an apology to the Pope and it is inserted in the second part of his ''&quot;Book of Considerations.&quot;'' There he explains how the sins of the crusaders were the cause of their misfortune and failures. When his attempt to call a new crusade failed, he tried to disassociate himself from the fiasco of the Second Crusade altogether.&lt;ref&gt;Runciman (1952) pp. 232–4 and pg. 277.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Final years (1149–53)==
[[Image:BernhardClairvaux Lactatio SourceUnknown.jpg|thumb|Bernard receiving milk from the breast of the Virgin Mary. The scene is a legend which allegedly took place at [[Speyer Cathedral]] in 1146.]]
The death of his contemporaries served as a warning to Bernard of his own approaching end. The first to die was Suger in 1152, of whom Bernard wrote to Eugenius III, &quot;If there is any precious vase adorning the palace of the King of Kings it is the soul of the venerable Suger&quot;. Conrad III and his son Henry died the same year. From the beginning of the year 1153, Bernard felt his death approaching. The passing of Pope Eugenius had struck the fatal blow by taking from him one whom he considered his greatest friend and consoler. Bernard died at age sixty-three on August 20, 1153, after forty years spent in the cloister.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bunson 1998 p.130&quot;/&gt; He was buried at the Clairvaux Abbey, but after its dissolution in 1792 by the [[French Revolution|French revolutionary government]], his remains were translated to the [[Troyes Cathedral]].

==Theology==
{{Main|Doctor Mellifluus}}

At the 800th anniversary of his death, [[Pope Pius XII]] issued an encyclical on Bernard, [[Doctor Mellifluus]] in which he labeled  him ''&quot;The Last of the Fathers.&quot;'' Bernard did not reject human philosophy which is genuine philosophy, which leads to God; he differentiates between different kinds of knowledge; the highest being theological. Three central elements of Bernard's mariology are: how he explained the [[Virginity]] of Mary, ''the &quot;Star of the Sea&quot;'', how the faithful should pray on the Virgin Mary, and how he relied on the Virgin Mary as [[Mediatrix]].

Bernard also held some doctrines which the Reformers would later rekindle at the beginnings of the Protestant movement. Some people have therefore equated him with a Protestant before there were Protestants. In truth he held to a mix of the Reformers' doctrines and the doctrines of the Roman Catholic Church of his day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=ZWRKAAAAYAAJ&amp;lpg=RA1-PA188&amp;ots=4ML1vBsosK&amp;dq=Epist.%20174%20Bernard&amp;pg=RA1-PA188#v=onepage&amp;q=Epist.%20174%20Bernard&amp;f=false Bernard of Clairvaux: The Times, the Man, and His Work]&lt;/ref&gt; Bernard fought against the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception of Mary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=ZWRKAAAAYAAJ&amp;lpg=RA1-PA188&amp;ots=4ML1vBsosK&amp;dq=Epist.%20174%20Bernard&amp;pg=RA1-PA188#v=onepage&amp;q=Epist.%20174%20Bernard&amp;f=false Epistle 174]&lt;/ref&gt; Also of great importance to the Reformers would be Bernard's conception of justification. Calvin quotes Bernard several times to show the historical valididy of [[Sola fide|Sola Fide]]{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}, which Luther described as 'the article upon which the church stands or falls'{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}. Calvin also quotes him extensively in setting forth his doctrine of a forensic alien righteousness,or as it is commonly called [[imputed righteousness]]{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}.

==Legacy==
[[Image:Stained glass St Bernard MNMA Cl3273.jpg|thumb|left|Stained glass representing Bernard. Upper Rhine, ca. 1450.]]

Bernard's theology and [[Mariology(RC)|Mariology]] continue to be of major importance, particularly within the Cistercian and Trappist orders.&lt;ref&gt;His texts are prescribed readings in Cistercian congregations&lt;/ref&gt; Bernard led to the foundation of 163 monasteries in different parts of Europe. At his death, they numbered 343. His influence led [[Pope Alexander III]] to launch reforms that would lead to the establishment of [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Duffy101&quot;&gt;Duffy (1997) p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; He was the first Cistercian monk placed on the [[calendar of saints]] and was [[canonized]] by [[Pope Alexander III]] January 18, 1174. [[Pope Pius VIII]] bestowed on him the title of Doctor of the Church. He is fondly remembered as the ''&quot;Mellifluous Doctor,&quot;'' (the Honey-Sweet Doctor), for his eloquence. The Cistercians honour him as only the founders of orders are honoured, because of the widespread activity which he gave to the order.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bunson 1998 p.130&quot;/&gt; The works of Bernard are as follows:

* ''&quot;De Gradibus Superbiae,&quot;'' his first treatise.

* Homilies on the Gospel ''&quot;Missus est&quot;'' written in 1120.

* ''&quot;Apology to William of St. Thierry&quot;'' against the claims of the monks of Cluny.

* ''&quot;On the Conversion of Clerics,&quot;'' a book addressed to the young ecclesiastics of Paris written in 1122.

* ''&quot;De Laude Novae Militiae,&quot;'' addressed to [[Hugues de Payens]], first Grand Master and Prior of Jerusalem (1129). This is a eulogy of the military order instituted in 1118, and an exhortation to the knights to conduct themselves with courage in their several stations.

* ''&quot;De amore Dei&quot;'' wherein Bernard argues that the manner of loving God is to love without measure and gives the different degree of this love.

* ''&quot;Book of Precepts and Dispensations&quot;'' (1131), which contains answers to questions upon certain points of the Rule of St Benedict from which the abbot can, or cannot, dispense.

* ''&quot;De Gratiâ et Libero Arbitrio&quot;'' in which the Roman Catholic dogma of grace and free will was defended according to the principles of St Augustine.
* [http://books.google.com/books?id=kkoJAQAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22Saint+Bernard+On+consideration%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ubhoTZnSHsTflgeZk9mBAg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''&quot;De Consideratione&quot;'' (&quot;''On Consideration&quot;'')], addressed to Pope Eugenius III.

* ''&quot;De Officiis Episcoporum,&quot;'' addressed to Henry, Archbishop of Sens.

[[File:StBernardFS.jpg|thumb|An engraving of The Lactation of Saint Bernard of Clairvaux. Virgin Mary is shooting milk into the eye of Saint Bernard of Clairvaux from her left breast which allegedly miraculously cured an eye affliction.]]
His sermons are also numerous:

* On Psalm 90, ''&quot;Qui habitat,&quot;'' written about 1125.

* ''&quot;On the Song of Songs''&quot;. [with an autobiographical passage, sermon 26, mourning the death of his brother, Gerard]&lt;ref&gt;Wim Verbaal, &quot;Preaching the Dead from Their Graves: Bernard of Clairvaux's Lament on His Brother Gerard,&quot; in: ''Speculum Sermonis: Interdisciplinary Reflections on the Medieval Sermon'', ed. Georgiana Donavin, Cary J. Nederman, and Richard Utz. Turnhout: Brepols, 2004. Pp. 113-39&lt;/ref&gt;

* There are also 86 ''&quot;Sermons for the Whole Year.&quot;''

* 530 letters survive.

Many letters, treatises, and other works, falsely attributed to him survive, such as the ''l'Echelle du Cloître'', ''les Méditations'', and ''l'Edification de la Maison intérieure''.

Saint Bernard's [[Prayer to the shoulder wound of Jesus]] is often published in Catholic prayer books.

Saint Bernard's views on the Virgin Mary also influenced other saints, e.g. in the classic text on [[Roman Catholic Mariology|Mariology]], ''[[The Glories of Mary]]'', [[Saint Alphonsus Liguori]] based his analysis of Mary as the &quot;''Gate to Heaven''&quot; on Saint Bernard's statement:&lt;ref&gt;[[Saint Alphonsus Liguori]], ''[[The Glories of Mary]]'', Liguori Publications, 2000, ISBN 0-7648-0664-5&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
No one can enter Heaven unless by Mary, as though through a door.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Dante Alighieri]]'s &quot;[[Divine Comedy]]&quot; places him as the last guide for Dante, as he travels through the Empyrean (''[[Paradiso]]'', cantos XXXI–XXXIII). Dante's choice appears to be based on Bernard's contemplative mysticism, his devotion to Mary, and his reputation for eloquence.&lt;ref&gt;Botterill (1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

He is also the attributed author of the poem often translated in English hymnals as [[O Sacred Head, Now Wounded]].

'''Bishkek''' (in [[Kyrgyz language|Kyrgyz]] and Russian: Бишкек), formerly '''Pishpek''' and '''Frunze''', is the capital and the largest city of [[Kyrgyzstan]].
Bishkek is also the administrative centre of [[Chuy Province]] which surrounds the city, even though the city itself is not part of the province but rather a province-level unit of Kyrgyzstan.

The name is thought to derive from a [[Kyrgyz language|Kyrgyz]] word for a churn used to make fermented mare's milk ([[kumis]]), the Kyrgyz national drink. Founded in 1825 as the Kyrgyz-Khokand fortress of &quot;Bishkek&quot;, then, in 1862, named as the Russian fortress ''Pishpek'' (крепость Пишпек),&lt;ref&gt;282 Гвардейский Краснознаменный мотострелковый полк имени М. В. Фрунзе в/ч 73809 п/о Подгорное Кой-Таш [http://blogs.mail.ru/mail/73809.18/]&lt;/ref&gt; in 1926 the city was renamed ''Frunze'' (Фрунзе), after the [[Bolshevik]] military leader [[Mikhail Frunze]]. In 1991, the Kyrgyz parliament restored the city's historical name.

Bishkek is situated at about {{convert|800|m}} altitude just off the northern fringe of the [[Kyrgyz Ala-Too]] range, an extension of the [[Tian Shan]] mountain range, which rises up to {{convert|4855|m}} and provides a spectacular backdrop to the city. North of the city, a fertile and gently undulating steppe extends far north into neighboring [[Kazakhstan]]. The [[Chui River]] drains most of the area. Bishkek is connected to the [[Turkestan-Siberia Railway]] by a [[spur line]].

Bishkek is a city of wide boulevards and marble-faced public buildings combined with numerous [[Khrushchyovka|Soviet-style]] apartment blocks surrounding interior courtyards and, especially outside the city centre, thousands of smaller privately built houses. It is laid out on a grid pattern, with most streets flanked on both sides by narrow irrigation channels that water the innumerable trees which provide shade in the hot summers.

==History==
Originally a caravan rest stop (possibly founded by the [[Sogdians]]) on one of the branches of the [[Silk Road]] through the [[Tian Shan]] range, the location was fortified in 1825 by the [[Uzbekistan|Uzbek]] khan of [[Kokhand]] with a mud fort.

The Kyrgyz legend says that the place was a burial site of the hero Bishkek, the local Kyrgyz war lord who fought for the Kyrgyz independence in the 18th century.

In 1862, the fort was conquered and razed when [[Imperial Russia|Tsarist Russia]] annexed the area. The site became a Russian garrison and was redeveloped and named &quot;Pishpek&quot; from 1877 onward by the Russian government, which encouraged the settlement of Russian peasants by giving them fertile [[black soil]] farms to develop. In 1926, the city became the capital of the newly established [[Kirghiz Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|Kirghiz ASSR]] and was renamed &quot;Frunze&quot; after [[Mikhail Frunze]], [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin's]] close associate who was born in Bishkek and played key roles during the [[Russian Revolution of 1905|1905]] and [[Russian Revolution of 1917|1917 revolutions]] and during the [[Russian civil war]] of the early 1920s.

The early 1990s were tumultuous. In June 1990, a state of emergency was declared following severe riots in southern Kyrgyzstan which threatened to spread to the capital. The city was renamed Bishkek on 5 February 1991 and Kyrgyzstan achieved independence later that year during the [[History of the Soviet Union (1985-1991)|breakup of the Soviet Union]]. Before independence, Bishkek was a &quot;Russified&quot; city, the majority of its population being ethnic [[Russian people|Russians]]. In 2004, Russians made up approximately 20% of the city's population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3681/is_200407/ai_n9472919 Residential Real Estate Market in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan: Current Conditions and Prospects]&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, Bishkek is a rapidly modernizing city, with many restaurants and cafes and lots of second-hand European and Japanese cars and minibuses crowding its streets. At the same time Bishkek still preserves its former Soviet feel, with Soviet-period buildings and gardens prevailing over newer structures.

Bishkek is also the country's financial centre, with all of the country's 21 commercial banks featuring offices in the city. During the Soviet era, the city was home to a large number of industrial plants, but most have been shut down or operate today on a much reduced scale. One of today's Bishkek's largest employment centres is [[Dordoy Bazaar]], which is one the major [[entrepôt]]s for Chinese goods imported into [[CIS]] countries.

==Geography==
===Orientation===
Though the city is relatively young, the surrounding area has some sites of interest dating from prehistory, the [[Greco-Buddhist]] period, the period of [[Nestorian]] influence, the era of the Central Asian ''[[khanate]]s'', and the Soviet period.

[[File:Bishkek church 01.jpg|thumb|right|Bishkek [[Orthodox Church]]]]
[[File:Bishkek historical museum.jpg|thumb|right|National Historical Museum]]

The central part of the city is primarily built on a rectangular grid plan. The city's main street is the east-west Chui Avenue (''Prospekt Chui''), named after the region's [[Chui River|main river]]. In the Soviet era, it was called [[Lenin]] Avenue. Along, or within a block or two from it, many of the most important government buildings, universities, the Academy of Sciences compound, and so on, are to be found. The westernmost section of the avenue is known as [[Deng Xiaoping]] Avenue.

The main north-south axis is [[Yusup Abdrakhmanov]] Street, still (2007) commonly referred to by its old name, ''Sovietskaya Street''. Its northern and southern sections are called, respectively, Yelebesov and Baityk Batyr Streets. Several major shopping centres are located along it, and in the north it provides access to [[Dordoy Bazaar]].

Erkindik (&quot;Freedom&quot;) Boulevard runs north-south, from the main railroad station (Bishkek II) south of Chui Avenue to the museum quarter and sculpture park just north of Chui Avenue, and further north toward the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In the past, it was called Dzerzhinsky Boulevard—named after [[Communism|Communist]] revolutionary, [[Felix Edmundovich Dzerzhinsky|Felix Dzerzhinsky]]—and its northern continuation is still called Dzerzhinsky Street.

An important east-west street is Jibek Jolu ('[[Silk Road]]'). It runs parallel to Chui Avenue about a mile north of it, and is part of the main east-west road of [[Chui Province]]. Both the Eastern and Western bus terminals are located along Jibek Jolu.

There is a Roman Catholic church located at ul. Vasiljeva 197 (near Rynok Bayat). This is the only Catholic Cathedral in Kyrgyzstan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholic-kyrgyzstan.org/ Catholic Church in Kyrgyzstan]&lt;/ref&gt;

===City centre===
* State Historical Museum, located in [[Ala-Too Square]], the main city square
* State Museum of Applied Arts, containing examples of Kyrgyz traditional [[handicraft]]s
* Frunze House Museum
* Statue of [[Ivan Panfilov]] stands in the park near the [[White House (Bishkek)|White House]].
* An [[equestrian statue]] of [[Mikhail Frunze]] still stands in a large park (Boulevard Erkindik) across from the train station.
* The train station itself was built in 1946 by German prisoners of war and has survived since then without further renovation or repairs; most of those who built it perished and were buried in unmarked pits near the station.
* The main government building, the [[White House (Bishkek)|White House]], is a huge, seven story marble block and the former headquarters of the Communist Party of the [[Kirghiz Soviet Socialist Republic|Kirghiz SSR]]
* At Ala-Too Square, there is an Independence monument where the changing of the guards may be watched.
* [[Osh bazaar]], west of the downtown area, is a large, picturesque produce market

===Outer neighbourhoods===
The [[Dordoy Bazaar]], just inside the bypass highway on the north-eastern edge of the city, is a major retail and wholesale market.

===Outside the city===
The [[Kyrgyz Ala-Too]] mountain range, some {{convert|40|km}} away, provides a spectacular backdrop to the city; the [[Ala Archa National Park]] is only a 30 to 45 minutes drive away.

===Climate===
Bishkek has a [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''[[Humid continental climate#Dfa/Dwa/Dsa: Hot (or very warm) summer subtype|Dsa]]''&lt;ref&gt;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2e/Asia_Koppen_Map.png&lt;/ref&gt;) averaging 322 clear days annually due to its mountainous location. Average [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] is around {{convert|440|mm}} per year. Average daily [[temperature]]s range from {{convert|−3|°C|1}} in January to about {{convert|25|°C|1}} during July.&lt;ref name = Pogoda /&gt; The summer months are dominated by dry periods experiencing the occasional [[thunderstorm]] which produces strong gusty winds and rare [[dust storm]]s. The [[mountain]]s to the [[south]] provide a natural boundary to provide protection from much of the damaging weather along with the smaller chain which runs NW to SE. In the winter months, sparse [[Winter storm|snow storms]] and frequent heavy [[fog]] are the dominating features. When an inversion sets up, the fog can last for days at a time.

==Ecology and Environment==
===Air Quality===
Emissions of air pollutants in Bishkek amounted to 21.9 thousand tons in 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;meteo.ktnet.kg&quot;&gt;http://www.meteo.ktnet.kg/unzps/unzps.php Kyrgyz State Agency on Hydrometeorology (in Russian)&lt;/ref&gt; Of all other cities of Kyrgyzstan, the level of air pollution in Bishkek is the highest with occasional exceeding maximum allowable concentrations by several times, especially in the city's center.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.kg/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=18&amp;Itemid=11&amp;lang=ru Web-site of the State Agency on Environment Protection and Forestry: Assessment of Air Pollution]&lt;/ref&gt;

Responsibility for ambient air quality monitoring in Bishkek lies on Kyrgyz State Agency on Hydrometeorology. In total, there are 7 air quality monitoring stations in Bishkek, measuring levels of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, formaldehyde, and ammonia.&lt;ref name=&quot;meteo.ktnet.kg&quot;/&gt;

==Economy==
{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}
[[File:E7919-Dordoy-Bazaar-clothing.jpg|thumb|left|[[Dordoy Bazaar]]]]
Bishkek uses the Kyrgystan currency, the [[Kyrgyzstani som|som]]. The som's value fluctuates regularly, but averages around 47 som per U.S. Dollar as of March 2011. The economy in Bishkek is primarily agricultural with the mass amounts of fruits, vegetables and livestock providing a co-existing system of bartering in the outlying regions. The streets of Bishkek are regularly lined with produce vendors in a market style venue. In the major portions of downtown there is a more urban cityscape with banks, stores, markets and malls. The most sought after of the goods are the prevalent hand-crafted artisan pieces; these include statues, carvings, paintings and many nature based sculptures.
[[File:Bishkek White House.JPG|thumb|right|The Bishkek White House, seat of the Kyrgyzstan government, president and parliament.]]

==Government==
Local government is administered by the Bishkek Mayor's Office. [[Askarbek Salymbekov]] was mayor until his resignation in August 2005, following which his deputy [[Arstanbek Nogoev]] took over the mayorship. Nogoev was in turn removed from his position in October 2007 through a decree of President [[Kurmanbek Bakiyev]] and replaced by businessman and former first deputy prime minister [[Daniar Usenov]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesca.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=182916&amp;Itemid=7|publisher=The Times of Central Asia|title=New mayor of Bishkek promises to solve capital’s problems|date=17 October 2007|accessdate=18 October 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071024001610/http://www.timesca.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=182916&amp;Itemid=7 |archivedate = October 24, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://jamestown.org/edm/article.php?article_id=2372503|journal=Eurasia Daily Monitor|publisher=The Jamestown Foundation|volume=4|issue=190|last=Marat|first=Erica|title=Upcoming referendum sinks Kyrgyzstan deeper into crisis|date=15 October 2007|accessdate=18 October 2007  |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071022122621/http://jamestown.org/edm/article.php?article_id=2372503 |archivedate = October 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kyrgyz capital gets new mayor|url=http://www.hri.org/news/balkans/rferl/2005/05-08-22.rferl.html#20|publisher=Radio Free Europe|date=22 August 2005|accessdate=18 October 2007|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uKgVssqi |archivedate = 2010-11-18|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2008 former head of the Kyrgyz Railways [[Nariman Tuleyev]] was appointed mayor, who was unscrupulously displaced by the interim government after 7 April 2010.

===Mass public transport===
There is public transportation available, including buses, electric [[trolley bus]]es, and public vans (known in Russian as ''[[marshrutka]]'').
Taxi cabs can be found throughout the city.

There is no subway in Bishkek, but the city is considering designing and building a light rail system ([[:ru:Бишкекское лёгкое метро|Бишкекское лёгкое метро]]).

===Commuter and long-distance buses===
There are two main bus stations in Bishkek. The smaller old Eastern Bus Station is primarily the terminal for minibuses to various destinations within or just beyond the eastern suburbs, such as [[Kant]], [[Tokmok]], [[Kemin]], [[Issyk Ata]], or the [[Korday]] border crossing.

Long-distance regular bus and minibus services to all parts of the country, as well as to [[Almaty]] (the largest city in neighboring [[Kazakhstan]]) and [[Kashgar]], China, run mostly from the newer grand Western Bus Station; only a smaller minority of them runs from the Eastern Station.

The Dordoy Bazaar on the north-eastern outskirts of the city also contains makeshift terminals for frequent minibuses to suburban towns in all directions (from [[Sokuluk]] in the west to [[Tokmak]] in the east) and to some buses taking traders to Kazakhstan and Siberia.

As of 2007, the Bishkek railway station sees only a few trains a day. It offers a popular three-day train service from Bishkek to Moscow.

There are also long-distance trains that leave for Siberia ([[Novosibirsk]] and [[Novokuznetsk]]), via [[Almaty]], over the [[Turksib]] route, and to [[Yekaterinburg]] (Sverdlovsk) in the Urals, via [[Astana]]. These services are remarkably slow (over 48 hours to Yekaterinburg), due to long stops at the border and the indirect route (the trains first have to go west for more than a {{convert|100|km}} before they enter the main [[Turksib]] line and can continue to the east or north). for example,, as of the fall of 2008, train No. 305 Bishkek-Yekaterinburg was scheduled to take 11 hours to reach the [[Shu, Kazakhstan|Shu]] junction—a distance of some {{convert|269|km}} by rail, and less than half of that by road.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.poezda.net/ru/train_timetable?st_code=2708000&amp;order=&amp;forDate=03-10-2008&amp;tr_code=770229% Schedule for train No. 305, Bishkek-Yekaterinburg] {{Ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Air===
The city is served by [[Manas International Airport]] ([[International Air Transport Association|IATA]] code FRU), located approximately {{convert|25|km}} northwest of the city centre, and readily reachable by taxi.

In 2002, the United States obtained the right to use the nearby [[Manas International Airport]] as an [[Manas Air Base|air base]] for its military operations in [[Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq]]. Russia subsequently (2003) established an air base of its own ([[Kant (air base)|Kant Air Base]]) near [[Kant, Kyrgyzstan|Kant]] some {{convert|20|km}} east of Bishkek. It is based at a facility that used to be home to a major Soviet military pilot training school; one of its students, [[Hosni Mubarak]], later became president of [[Egypt]].

'''''Braveheart''''' is a 1995 [[epic film|epic]] [[List of historical drama films|historical]] [[drama film]] directed by and starring [[Mel Gibson]]. The film was written for the screen and then novelized by [[Randall Wallace]]. Gibson portrays [[Sir William Wallace]], a 13th century [[Scottish people|Scottish]] [[knight]] who gained recognition when he came to the forefront of the [[First War of Scottish Independence]] by opposing King [[Edward I of England]], also known as &quot;Longshanks&quot; ([[Patrick McGoohan]]).

The film won five [[Academy Awards]] at the [[68th Academy Awards]], including the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], and was nominated for an additional five.

==Plot==
In the 13th Century England, after several years of political unrest in Scotland, the land is open to an invasion from the south. King Edward I of England (Patrick McGoohan) decided to conquer Scotland. After invading Scotland and winning the war by 1280 A.D., Edward (known as 'Longshanks') granted areas of land in Scotland to his nobility which they were to rule, along with the traditional privileges. One of these privileges was [[Droit de seigneur|Primae Noctis]], the right for the lord to take a newly married Scottish woman into his bed and spend the wedding night with the bride.

William Wallace (Mel Gibson) grows up in this atmosphere of repression and fear and survives the death of his father and brother. Wallace is taken abroad by his uncle (Brian Cox). They travel to Europe and Wallace learns to read, write and speak Latin and French. When he returns home, he falls in love with his childhood sweetheart Murron MacClannough (Catherine McCormack), and they marry in secret so that she does not have to spend a night in the bed of the English lord.

The Scots continue to live under the iron fist of Longshanks' cruel laws. Wallace intends on living as a farmer and avoiding involvement in the ongoing &quot;troubles&quot;. When an English soldier tries to rape Murron, Wallace fights off several soldiers and the two attempt to flee, but the village sheriff captures Murron and publicly executes her by slitting her throat, proclaiming &quot;an assault on the King's soldiers is the same as an assault on the King himself.&quot; In retribution, Wallace and several villagers slaughter the English garrison, executing the sheriff in the same manner that he executed Murron.

After this, Wallace is compelled to fight against the English, and in response to Wallace's exploits, the commoners of Scotland rise in revolt against England. As his legend spreads, hundreds of Scots from the surrounding clans volunteer to join Wallace's militia. Wallace leads his army through a series of successful battles against the English, including the [[Battle of Stirling Bridge]] on September 11, 1297, and the sacking of the city of York. All the while, Wallace seeks the assistance of young Robert the Bruce (Angus Macfadyen), son of the leper noble Robert the Elder (Ian Bannen) and the chief contender for the Scottish crown. However, Robert is dominated by his scheming father, who wishes to secure the throne of Scotland to his son by bowing down to the English, despite his son's growing admiration for Wallace and his cause.

King Edward Longshanks, worried enough by the threat of the rebellion, poses to send the French princess Isabelle (Sophie Marceau) to try and negotiate peace with Wallace. Princess Isabelle is the wife of Prince Edward (Peter Hanly), the Prince of Wales and Longshanks's oldest son. The King sends her because his son is a weak-willed man and would not be imposing enough to negotiate, but she is a strong leader. Longshanks also knows that if Wallace kills her, the French king will declare war on Wallace in revenge. Isabelle meets with Wallace, but having heard of him beforehand and after meeting him in person, she becomes enamored with him and secretly assists him in his fight. Eventually, she and Wallace make love, after which she becomes pregnant.

For Wallace to continue fighting, he needs the Scottish nobility on his side, contributing troops and food. But Wallace has problems convincing the nobility that they have a real chance to take back the country from the English. The nobles are more interested in their own welfare, assisted by British privileges and bribes, than the welfare of their subjects. Eventually, two of these nobles, Lochlan and Mornay, betray Wallace at the bloody [[Battle of Falkirk]] the following year on July 22, 1298 as a new and larger English army invades Scotland led by Edward Longshanks himself. The Scots lose the battle, and Wallace nearly loses his life when, in a last desperate act, he furiously breaks ranks and charges toward Longshanks to kill him personally. He is intercepted by one of the king's lancers, who turns out to be Robert the Bruce, but in an act of remorse Bruce is able to get Wallace to safety just before the English can capture him. Over the next seven years, Wallace goes into hiding and wages a protracted guerilla war against the English. In order to repay Mornay and Lochlan for their betrayals, Wallace brutally murders both men.

Robert the Bruce contacts Wallace to set up a meeting, where the Bruce intends to declare his intent to join Wallace and commit troops to the war. Still believing there is some good in the nobility of his country, Wallace eventually agrees to meet with Robert the Bruce in Edinburgh. However, Robert's father has conspired with the other nobles to set a trap, and Wallace is caught and handed over to the English. Learning of his father's treachery, the younger Robert Bruce disowns his father. Isabelle has her own revenge on the now terminally ill Longshanks by quietly confessing to him that she is pregnant with another's child and that she will end Longshank's line and rule following his death.

In London, Wallace is brought before the English magistrates, tried for high treason, and sentenced to execution by public torture and beheading at the Tower of London. Even under horrible pain, Wallace refuses to submit to the king and beg for mercy. Awed by Wallace's courage, the Londoners watching the execution begin to yell for mercy, and the magistrate offers him one final chance for mercy. Using the last strength in his body, the defiant William instead shouts, &quot;Freedom!&quot; Just as he is about to be beheaded, Wallace sees an image of Murron in the crowd smiling at him, before the blow is struck.

Epilogue. In 1314, nine years after Wallace's death, Robert the Bruce, now a Scottish king and still guilt-ridden over his involvement Wallace's betrayal, leads a strong Scottish army and faces a ceremonial line of English troops at the fields of Bannockburn where the English under their new king are to accept him as the rightful ruler of Scotland. Just as he is about to ride to accept the English endorsement, the Bruce turns back to his troops. Invoking Wallace's memory, he urges his charges to fight with him as they did with Wallace. Robert then turns toward the English troop line and leads a charge toward the English, who were not expecting to fight. The film ends with Mel Gibson's voice intoning that the Scottish won their freedom in this battle.

==Cast==
* [[Mel Gibson]] as [[William Wallace]], the film's [[tragic hero]]. When his father and brother are killed fighting English soldiers, he leaves Scotland and travels abroad with his uncle. Upon returning, he marries his childhood friend Murron. After Murron is summarily executed by an English [[magistrate]], Wallace leads an uprising demanding justice that leads to the [[Wars of Scottish Independence]].
* [[Patrick McGoohan]] as King [[Edward I of England]], the primary [[antagonist]]. Nicknamed &quot;Longshanks&quot; for his height over 6 feet, the King is depicted as a tyrannical [[psychopath]]. He is also shown to be emotionally and physically abusive to his son. Determined to ruthlessly put down the Scottish uprising, he intends to ensure his rule over all of [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. Despite serving as the film's villain, he and Wallace do not share a single scene throughout.
* [[Angus Macfadyen]] as [[Robert I of Scotland|Robert, 17th Earl of Bruce]], son of the elder Bruce and claimant to the throne of Scotland, he is inspired by Wallace's dedication and bravery.
* [[Brendan Gleeson]] as Hamish Campbell. Wallace's childhood friend and captain in Wallace's army, he is often short-sighted and thinks with his fists.
* [[Sophie Marceau]] as [[Isabella of France|Princess Isabelle of France]], who sympathizes with the Scottish and admires Wallace.
* [[Peter Hanly]] as Prince [[Edward II of England|Edward, Prince of Wales]]. The son of King Edward and husband of Princess Isabelle through an arranged marriage. A homosexual, he suffers from emotional and physical abuse at the hands of his father. The Prince's male lover Phillip is killed by King Edward by being thrown out of a castle window.
* [[Ian Bannen]] as [[Robert de Brus, 6th Lord of Annandale|the elder Robert the Bruce]]. Unable to seek the throne personally due to his disfiguring [[leprosy]], he [[sociopath]]ically plots to make his son the next King of Scotland despite the claims of the [[John of Scotland|Balliol clan]] to the throne.
* [[James Cosmo]] as Campbell the Elder. The father of Hamish Campbell and captain in Wallace's army.
* [[Catherine McCormack]] as [[Murron MacClannough]], the murdered wife of Wallace. Her name was changed from [[Blind Harry]]'s [[Marion Braidfute]] in the script so as to not be confused with the [[Maid Marian]] of [[Robin Hood]] legend.
* [[David O'Hara]] as Stephen. An Irish recruit to the Scottish army, he endears himself to Wallace with his humor, which may or may not be insanity, and his knowledge of guerrilla warfare. He professes to be the most wanted man on &quot;my island,&quot; and claims to speak to God personally. He becomes one of Wallace's captains and quasi-bodyguard, saving his life several times.
* [[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]] as Argyle Wallace. A [[Roman Catholic]] priest and uncle to William. After the death of Wallace's father and brother, Argyle takes Wallace as a child into his care. Promising to teach the boy how to use a sword after he learns to use his head, he teaches Wallace to speak and read fluent French and Latin. He is also described as having taken his nephew on [[pilgrimage]] to the [[Holy See]].
* James Robinson as young William Wallace. The 10-year old actor reportedly spent weeks trying to copy Gibson's mannerisms for the film.

==Conception==
The script for ''Braveheart'' was based mainly on [[Blind Harry]]'s 15th century [[epic poem]], ''The Actes and Deidis of the Illustre and Vallyeant Campioun Schir William Wallace''. In defending his script against criticism, Randall Wallace has said, &quot;Is Blind Harry true? I don't know. I know that it spoke to my heart and that's what matters to me, that it spoke to my heart.&quot;&lt;ref name = anderson&gt;Anderson, Lin. &quot;Braveheart: From Hollywood to Holyrood.&quot; Luath Press Ltd. (2005): 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
Gibson's [[production company|company]] [[Icon Productions]] had difficulty raising enough money even if he were to star in the film. [[Warner Bros.]] was willing to fund the project on the condition that Gibson sign for another ''[[Lethal Weapon]]'' sequel, which he refused. [[Paramount Pictures]] only agreed to American and Canadian distribution of ''Braveheart'' after [[20th Century Fox]] partnered for international rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117926430.html | title =
Mel tongue-ties studios| author = Michael Fleming | publisher = [[Daily Variety]] | date = 2005-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the crew spent six weeks shooting on location in Scotland, the major battle scenes were shot in [[Ireland]] using members of the [[Reserve Defence Forces|Irish Army Reserve]] as extras. To lower costs, Gibson had the same extras portray both armies. The opposing armies are made up of reservists, up to 1,600 in some scenes, who had been given permission to grow beards and swapped their drab uniforms for medieval garb.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unison.ie/meath_chronicle/stories.php3?ca=41&amp;si=1031035&amp;issue_id=9666 Braveheart 10th Chance To Boost Tourism In Trim]{{dead link|date=March 2011}}, Meath Chronicle, August 28, 2003 . Retrieved 30 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Gibson, he was inspired by the big screen epics he had loved as a child, such as [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s [[Spartacus (film)|''Spartacus'']] and [[William Wyler]]'s ''[[The Big Country]]''.

The film was shot in the [[anamorphic format]] with [[Panavision]] C- and E-Series lenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Chris Probst | title=Cinematic Transcendence| journal=[[American Cinematographer]] | publisher=[[American Society of Cinematographers]] | volume=77 | issue=6 | page=76 | location=[[Los Angeles, California]], United States | date=1996-06-01 | issn=0002-7928 | accessdate=2010-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gibson toned down the film's battle scenes to avoid an [[NC-17]] rating from the [[MPAA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.magicdragon.com/Wallace/Brave5.html | title = Mel talks to Seoras Wallace | accessdate = 2010-06-19 | publisher = Magic Dragon Multimedia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was Rated R for &quot;brutal medieval warfare.&quot;

In addition to English being the film's primary language, French, Latin, and [[Scottish Gaelic]] are also spoken.

==Release and reception==
===Box office===
On its opening weekend, grossed US$9,938,276 in the United States and $75.6 million in its box office run in the United States and Canada.&lt;ref name=&quot;boxofficemojo1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=braveheart.htm |title=Braveheart (1995) |publisher=Boxofficemojo.com |date= |accessdate=2009-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Worldwide, the movie grossed $210,409,945 and was the 18th highest grossing film of 1995.&lt;ref name=&quot;boxofficemojo1&quot; /&gt;

===Cultural effects===
The film is credited by [[Lin Anderson]], author of ''Braveheart: From Hollywood To Holyrood'' as having played a significant role in affecting the [[Scottish political landscape]] in the mid to late 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Boztas |first=Senay |url=http://www.braveheart.info/news/2005/sunday_herald/2007-07-31/51063.html |title=Wallace movie ‘helped Scots get devolution’ - [Sunday Herald&amp;#93; |publisher=Braveheart.info |date=2005-07-31 |accessdate=2009-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wallace Monument===
[[File:BraveStatue 1200x1600.jpg|thumb|right|Tom Church's 'Freedom' statue.]]
In 1997, a 12-ton [[sandstone]] statue depicting Mel Gibson as William Wallace in ''Braveheart'' was placed in the car park of the [[Wallace Monument]] near [[Stirling]], [[Scotland]]. The statue, which was the work of Tom Church, a monumental mason from [[Brechin]],&lt;ref name=&quot;courer&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecourier.co.uk/output/2009/10/16/newsstory13954661t0.asp |work=[[The Courier]] |title=Wallace statue back at home of sculptor|accessdate=17 October 2009|date=16 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; included the word &quot;Braveheart&quot; on Wallace's shield. The installation became the cause of much controversy, one local resident stated that it was wrong to &quot;desecrate the main memorial to Wallace with a lump of crap.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=By Hal G.P. Colebatch on 8.8.06 @ 12:07AM |url=http://www.spectator.org/dsp_article.asp?art_id=10191 |title=The American Spectator |publisher=Spectator.org |date= |accessdate=2009-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998 the face on the statue was vandalised by someone wielding a hammer. After repairs were made, the statue was encased in a cage every night to prevent further vandalism. This only incited more calls for the statue to be removed as it then appeared that the Gibson/Wallace figure was imprisoned.

== Historical accuracy ==
Randall Wallace, the writer of the novel, has acknowledged [[Blind Harry]]'s 15th century [[epic poem]] ''The Acts and Deeds of Sir William Wallace, Knight of Elderslie'' as a major source of inspiration for the film.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Anderson, Lin. ''Braveheart: From Hollywood to Holyrood''. Luath Press Ltd. (2005), p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian Elizabeth Ewan describes ''Braveheart''  as a film which &quot;almost totally sacrifices historical accuracy for epic adventure&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;ewan&quot;&gt;Ewan, Elizabeth. &quot;Braveheart.&quot; American Historical Review 100, no. 4 (October 1995): 1219–21.&lt;/ref&gt; The title of the film is also historically inaccurate as the &quot;brave heart&quot; refers in Scottish history to that of [[Robert the Bruce]], and an attribution by [[William Edmondstoune Aytoun]], in his poem ''Heart of Bruce'', to [[Sir James the Good]]: ''&quot;Pass thee first, thou dauntless heart, As thou wert wont of yore!&quot;'', prior to Douglas's demise at the [[Battle of Teba]] in [[Andalusia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://infomotions.com/etexts/gutenberg/dirs/1/0/9/4/10945/10945.htm Lays of the Scottish Cavaliers and Other Poems / Aytoun, W. E. (William Edmondstoune), 1813-1865&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
The scenes depicting Princess Isabella and her hand maiden speaking French while at the English court for privacy are inaccurate.
From the time of the Norman invasion the language spoken by the English royal court and the vast majority of the nobility, at least at court, would have been French. The Norman dialect was the dominant tongue until the time of King Henry II who introduced a more mainstream French conversational dialect due to his Angevin upbringing. Edward Longshanks was only 3 generations removed as he was Henry II's great-grandson. 
Historian Alex von Tunzelmann writing in ''[[The Guardian]]'' noted several historical inaccuracies: William Wallace never met Princess [[Isabella of France|Isabella]], as she married [[King Edward II]] three years after Wallace's death (and was no older than ten when Wallace died), thus she never slept with him. Also, as her marriage to Edward took place after he had ascended the throne, she never held the title Princess of Wales. The infamous [[primae noctis]] (&quot;law of the first night&quot;) decree, seen in action early in the film, was never used by King Edward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = von Tunzelmann | first = Alex

Historian Sharon Krossa notes that the film contains numerous historical errors, beginning with the wearing of [[belted plaid]] by Wallace and his men. She points out that in the period in question, &quot;... no Scots ... wore belted plaids (let alone [[kilt]]s of any kind).&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;pvefbc&quot;&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the film was second on a list of &quot;most historically inaccurate movies&quot; in ''[[The Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =White | first =Caroline | title =The 10 most historically inaccurate movies | publisher = The Times | url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/film/article6738785.ece | date=August 4, 2009 | accessdate=2009-08-05 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final scenes of the film also suggest that William Wallace and [[Edward I of England]] died at exactly the same moment, which is false. Wallace was executed in 1305 and Edward I died in 1307.
===Portrayal of Robert the Bruce===
[[Image:Brave mel.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Mel Gibson as William Wallace wearing [[Isatis tinctoria|woad]].]]
The portrayal of [[Robert I of Scotland]] (Robert the Bruce) in the film is considered by historians to be wildly inaccurate. In particular his taking the field on the English side in the battle of [[Falkirk]] is completely fictitious; Bruce was not present at [[Falkirk]]. Although he repeatedly changed alliances between the rebels and the [[England|English]], mostly for political reasons, Bruce never betrayed Wallace directly, and Wallace was not known to have been a staunch supporter of Bruce.  The film's depiction of the Battle of Stirling Bridge shows the Scots facing off the English on a flat plain on equal terms, when in reality, it took place at a bridge where the outnumbered Scots were able to concentrate their forces on the overextended English who were in the process of crossing the bridge.

The film also has the Bruce starting the [[Battle of Bannockburn]] immediately after hearing of Wallace's death.  

In the 2007 humorous non-fictional historiography ''An Utterly Impartial History of Britain'', author [[John O'Farrell]] notes that ''Braveheart'' could not have been more historically inaccurate, even if a &quot;[[Plasticine]] dog&quot; had been inserted in the film and the title changed to ''William [[Wallace and Gromit]]''.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

Screenwriter Randall Wallace is very vocal about defending his script from historians who have dismissed the film as a Hollywood perversion of actual events.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} In the DVD audio commentary of ''Braveheart'', director Mel Gibson acknowledges many of the historical inaccuracies{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} but defends his choices as director, noting that the way events were portrayed in the film were much more &quot;cinematically compelling&quot; than the historical fact or conventional mythos. In truth the film is remarkably loyal to Randall Wallace's book and much of the criticism aimed at the filmmakers could be more appropriately aimed at the author's work, who opens his novel by claiming to be related to William Wallace in some way.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

===Portrayal of Prince Edward===
The depiction of [[Edward II of England|Prince Edward]] as an effeminate [[homosexual]] in the film drew accusations of [[homophobia]] against Gibson, particularly since the real [[Edward II]] fathered five children by two different women (although is strongly implied to have been at least bisexual due to his relationships with [[Piers Gaveston]], apparently favouring Gaveston over even his wife in several regards, and later [[Hugh Despenser the Younger|Hugh Despenser]]). Gibson replied that &quot;The fact that King Edward throws this character out a window has nothing to do with him being gay. ... He's terrible to his son, to everybody.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

  | accessdate = February 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gibson defended his depiction of Prince Edward as weak and ineffectual, saying,
{{quote|I'm just trying to respond to history. You can cite other examples – [[Alexander the Great]], for example, who conquered the entire world, was also a homosexual. But this story isn't about Alexander the Great. It's about Edward II.&lt;ref&gt;The San Francisco Chronicle, May 21, 1995, “Mel Gibson Dons Kilt and Directs” by Ruth Stein&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Gibson asserted that the reason that Longshanks kills his son’s lover is because the king is a “[[Psychopathy|psychopath]],”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dallasobserver.com/Issues/1995-05-25/film/film_3.html | title=Mel Gibson talks about Braveheart, movie stardom, and media treachery | author=Matt Zoller Seitz | publisher=Dallas Observer | accessdate=2008-01-27}}{{dead link|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he expressed bewilderment that some filmgoers would laugh at this murder:
{{quote|We cut a scene out, unfortunately . . . where you really got to know that character (Edward II) and to understand his plight and his pain. . . . But it just stopped the film in the first act so much that you thought, 'When's this story going to start?'&lt;ref&gt;USA Today, May 24, 1995, “Gibson has faith in family and freedom” by Marco R. della Cava&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Anglophobia===

''Braveheart'' has been accused of [[Anglophobia]].  The film was referred to in ''[[The Economist]]'' as &quot;[[xenophobic]]&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/PrinterFriendly.cfm?story_id=6941798 |title=Economist.com |publisher=Economist.com |date=2006-05-18 |accessdate=2009-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[John Sutherland (author)|John Sutherland]] writing in the ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' stated that, &quot;Braveheart gave full rein to a toxic Anglophobia&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2003/aug/11/religion.world | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=John Sutherland | date=2003-08-11 | accessdate=2010-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colin MacArthur, author of ''Brigadoon, Braveheart and the Scots: Distortions of Scotland in Hollywood Cinema'' calls it &quot;a fuckin' atrocious film&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;timesonline1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/scotland/article546776.ece |title=Braveheart battle cry is now but a whisper |publisher=Times Online |date= 2005-07-24|accessdate=2009-02-27 | location=London }}&lt;/ref&gt; and writes that a worrying aspect of the film is its appeal to &quot;(neo-)[[fascist]] groups and the attendant psyche.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

It’s a xenophobic film.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;timesonline1&quot;/&gt;   ''[[The Independent]]'' has noted, &quot;The ''Braveheart'' phenomenon, a Hollywood-inspired rise in Scottish nationalism, has been linked to a rise in anti-English prejudice&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/most-race-attack-victims-are-white-the-english-exiles-1069506.html |title=Most race attack victims `are white': The English Exiles - News |publisher=The Independent |date=1999-02-08 |accessdate=2009-02-27 | location=London | first=Ian | last=Burrell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Soundtrack ==
The soundtrack for Braveheart was composed and conducted by [[James Horner]], and performed by the [[London Symphony Orchestra]]. The  soundtrack, comprising 77 minutes of background music taken from significant scenes in the film, was noticeably successful, and album co-producer Simon Rhodes produced a follow-up soundtrack in 1997 titled ''More Music from Braveheart''. International and French versions of the soundtrack have also been released. {{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}

'''Brian Wilson Aldiss''', [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] (born 18 August 1925) is an English author of both general fiction and [[science fiction]]. His byline reads either '''Brian W. Aldiss''' or simply '''Brian Aldiss'''. Greatly influenced by science fiction pioneer [[H. G. Wells]], Aldiss is a vice-president of the international [[H. G. Wells Society]]. He is also (with [[Harry Harrison]]) co-president of the [[Birmingham Science Fiction Group]]. His writings have been compared to those of [[Isaac Asimov]], [[Greg Bear]] and [[Arthur C. Clarke]]. His influential works include the short story &quot;[[Super-Toys Last All Summer Long]]&quot;, the basis for the [[Stanley Kubrick]]-developed [[Steven Spielberg]] film ''[[A.I. Artificial Intelligence]]''.

== Biography ==
Aldiss's father ran a department store that his grandfather had established, and the family lived above it. At the age of 6, Brian was sent to board at [[West Buckland School]] in Devon, which he attended until his late teens. In 1943, he joined the [[Royal Signals]] regiment, and saw action in [[Myanmar|Burma]]; his encounters with tropical rainforests at that time may have been at least a partial inspiration for ''[[Hothouse (novel)|Hothouse]]'', as his Army experience inspired the Horatio Stubbs second and third books.

After [[World War II]], he worked as a bookseller in [[Oxford]]. Besides short science fiction for various magazines, he wrote a number of short pieces for a booksellers trade journal about life in a fictitious bookshop, and this attracted the attention of Charles Monteith, an editor at the British publishers [[Faber and Faber]]. As a result of this, Aldiss's first book was ''The Brightfount Diaries'' (1955), a novel in diary form about the life of a sales assistant in a bookshop.

In 1955, ''[[The Observer]]'' newspaper ran a competition for a short story set in the year 2500, which Aldiss won with a story entitled &quot;Not For An Age&quot;. ''The Brightfount Diaries'' had been a minor success, and Faber asked Aldiss if he had any more writing that they could look at with a view to publishing. Aldiss confessed to being a science fiction author, to the delight of the publishers, who had a number of science fiction fans in high places, and so his first science fiction book, a collection of short stories entitled ''Space, Time and Nathaniel'' was published. By this time, his earnings from writing equalled the wages he got in the bookshop, so he made the decision to become a full-time writer.

He was voted the Most Promising New Author at the [[Worldcon|World Science Fiction Convention]] in 1958, and elected President of the [[British Science Fiction Association]] in 1960. He was the literary editor of the ''Oxford Mail'' newspaper during the 1960s. Around 1964 he and his long-time collaborator [[Harry Harrison]] started the first ever journal of science fiction criticism, ''Science Fiction Horizons'', which during its brief span of two issues published articles and reviews by such authors as [[James Blish]], and featured a discussion among Aldiss, [[C. S. Lewis]], and [[Kingsley Amis]] in the first issues, and an interview with [[William S. Burroughs]] in the second.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Scifi omnibus.JPG|thumb|175px|The Penguin Science Fiction Omnibus - 1975 paperback edition. 36 stories - 616 pages]] --&gt;
Besides his own writings, he has had great success as an anthologist. For Faber he edited ''Introducing SF'', a collection of stories typifying various themes of science fiction, and ''Best Fantasy Stories''. In 1961 he edited an anthology of reprinted short science fiction for the British paperback publisher [[Penguin Books]] under the title ''Penguin Science Fiction''. This was remarkably successful, going into numerous reprints, and was followed up by two further anthologies, ''More Penguin Science Fiction'' (1963), and ''Yet More Penguin Science Fiction'' (1964). The later anthologies enjoyed the same success as the first, and all three were eventually published together as ''The Penguin Science Fiction Omnibus'' (1973), which also went into a number of reprints. In the 1970s, he produced several large collections of classic grand-scale science fiction, under the titles ''Space Opera'' (1974), ''Space Odysseys'' (1975), ''Galactic Empires'' (1976), ''Evil Earths'' (1976), and ''Perilous Planets'' (1978) which were quite successful. Around this time, he edited a large-format volume ''Science Fiction Art'' (1975), with selections of artwork from the magazines and [[pulp magazines|pulps]].

In response to the results from the [[Space probe|planetary probes]] of the 1960s and 1970s, which showed that [[Venus]] was completely unlike the hot, tropical jungle usually depicted in science fiction, he and Harry Harrison edited an anthology ''Farewell, Fantastic Venus!'', reprinting stories based on the pre-probe ideas of Venus. He also edited, with Harrison, a series of anthologies ''The Year's Best Science Fiction'' (1968-1976?) 

Brian Aldiss also invented a form of extremely short story called the [[Minisaga]]. The Daily Telegraph hosted a competition for the best Minisaga for several years and Aldiss was the judge.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/4717359/Your-chance-to-enter-the-Daily-Telegraph-Mini-saga-Competition-1999.html&lt;/ref&gt; He has edited several anthologies of the best Minisagas.

He traveled to Yugoslavia, where he met Yugoslav fans in Ljubljana, Slovenia; he published a travel book about Yugoslavia; he published an alternative-history fantasy story about Serbian kings in the Middle Ages; and he wrote a novel called  ''The Malacia Tapestry'', about an alternative Dalmatia. 

He has achieved the honor of &quot;Permanent Special Guest&quot; at [[ICFA]], the conference for the [http://www.iafa.org/ International Association for the Fantastic in the Arts], which he attends annually.

He was awarded the title of Officer of the [[Order of the British Empire]] (OBE) for services to literature in HM [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II's]] Birthday Honours list, announced on 11 June 2005.

In January 2007 he appeared on [[Desert Island Discs]]. His choice of record to 'save' was ''Old Rivers'' sung by [[Walter Brennan]], his choice of book was [[John Halpern]]’s biography of [[John Osborne]], and his luxury a banjo. The full selection of eight favourite records is on the BBC website [http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/features/desert-island-discs/castaway/fab50882#p0093tnd].

On 1 July 2008 he was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Liverpool in recognition of his contribution to literature.&lt;ref name=&quot;HonDoc&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.liv.ac.uk/news/press_releases/2008/06/honorary-graduates.htm|title=University of Liverpool announces 2008 honours|accessdate=2 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 he published his latest collection of poetry, ''Mortal Morning'' (published by Flambard Press). The cover art was taken from one of Brian's own paintings.

* ''[[Hothouse (novel)|Hothouse]]'' (1962) Set in a far future Earth, where the earth has stopped rotating, the Sun has increased output, and plants are engaged in a constant frenzy of growth and decay, like a tropical forest enhanced a thousandfold; a few small groups of elvish humans still live on the edge of extinction, beneath the giant [[banyan]] tree that covers the day side of the earth.

* ''[[An Age]]'' (1967: also published in the US as  ''Cryptozoic!'') a dystopic time-travel novel.
* ''Report On Probability A'' (1968) Described by Aldiss as an 'anti-novel', this book had its origins some years earlier, before being serialised in [[New Worlds (magazine)|New Worlds]] under [[Michael Moorcock]]'s editorship. The bulk of the book is the Report, describing in minute, obsessive and often repetitive detail, three characters G, S, and C as they secretly watch a house, each from a separate outbuilding with peripheral views of the house's windows, catching occasional glimpses of its occupant, Mrs Mary. As the Report is being read by a character called &quot;Domoladossa'&quot;, he is secretly being observed from other universes, and these observers in their turn are being observed, all of them engaged in futile speculation about the exact nature of Probability A, and the exact meaning of the Victorian [[painting]], ''[[The Hireling Shepherd]]'' (by [[Pre-Raphaelite]] [[William Holman Hunt]]; Holman Hunt's paintings also feature in Aldiss's short story ''The Secret of Holman Hunt and the Crude Death Rate'', published in 1975), which occurs in the Report. Later we learn that Mrs. Mary is watching a screen of her own, although this may just be a television set, and it is suggested that the painting may be a window into a world where time is standing still.
*  ed. ''[[Farewell Fantastic Venus]]'' (1968)
* ''[[Barefoot in the Head]]'' (1969) Perhaps Aldiss's most experimental work, this first appeared in several parts as the 'Acid Head War' series in New Worlds. Set in a Europe some years after a flare-up in the Middle East led to Europe being attacked with bombs releasing huge quantities of long-lived hallucinogenic drugs. Into an England with a population barely maintaining a grip on reality comes a young [[Serbs|Serb]], who himself starts coming under the influence of the ambient aerosols, and finds himself leading a messianic [[crusade]]. The narration and dialogue reflects the shattering of language under the influence of the drugs, in mutating phrases and puns and allusions, in a deliberate echo of ''[[Finnegans Wake]]''.

{{Campaignbox North Sea 1914-1918}}

The '''Battle of Jutland''' ({{lang-de|Skagerrakschlacht}}; {{lang-da|Søslaget ved Jylland / Søslaget om Skagerrak}}) was a naval battle between the [[Royal Navy]]'s [[Grand Fleet]] and the [[Imperial German Navy]]'s [[High Seas Fleet]] during the First World War. It was fought on 31 May and 1 June 1916 in the [[North Sea]] near [[Jutland]], Denmark. The battle was the largest [[naval battle]] and the only full-scale clash of [[battleship]]s in the war. It was also only the third major fleet action between steel battleships following the battles of the [[Battle of the Yellow Sea|Yellow Sea]] and [[Battle of Tsushima|Tsushima]] during the [[Russo-Japanese War]].

The German fleet was commanded by [[Reinhard Scheer|Vice-Admiral Reinhard Scheer]], and the [[Royal Navy]]'s [[Grand Fleet]] by [[John Jellicoe, 1st Earl Jellicoe|Admiral Sir John Jellicoe]]. The German fleet's intention was to lure out, trap, and destroy a portion of the Grand Fleet, as they believed that their smaller number of ships would be insufficient to engage the entire British fleet. This formed part of a larger strategy to break the British [[blockade of Germany]] and to allow German mercantile shipping to operate. Meanwhile, the Royal Navy was attempting to engage and destroy the High Seas Fleet, or keep the German force contained and away from Britain's [[Sea lines of communication|own shipping lanes]].

The Germans' plan was to use [[Franz von Hipper|Vice-Admiral Franz Hipper's]] fast scouting group of five modern battlecruisers to lure [[David Beatty, 1st Earl Beatty|Vice-Admiral Sir David Beatty's]] [[battlecruiser]] squadrons through a submarine picket line and into the path of the main German [[naval fleet|fleet]]. However, the British learned from signal intercepts that a major fleet operation was likely, so on 30 May, Jellicoe sailed with the Grand Fleet to rendezvous with Beatty, passing over the locations of the German submarine picket lines while they were unprepared.

On the afternoon of 31 May, Beatty encountered Hipper's battlecruiser force long before the Germans had expected, which eliminated any submarine influence. In a running battle, Hipper successfully drew the British vanguard into the path of the High Seas Fleet. By the time Beatty sighted the larger force and turned back towards the British main fleet, he had lost two battlecruisers from a force of six battlecruisers and four battleships, against the five ships commanded by Hipper. The battleships, commanded by Rear-Admiral [[Hugh Evan-Thomas|Sir Hugh Evan-Thomas]], were the last to turn and formed a [[rearguard]] as Beatty withdrew, drawing the German fleet in pursuit towards the main British positions. Between 18:30, when the sun was lowering on the western horizon, backlighting the German forces, and nightfall at about 20:30, the two huge fleets – totaling 250 ships between them – directly engaged each other twice.

Fourteen British and eleven German ships were sunk with great loss of life. After sunset, and throughout the night, Jellicoe manoeuvred to cut the Germans off from their base, in hopes of continuing the battle next morning, but under the cover of darkness, Scheer sailed behind the British fleet and returned to port.

Both sides claimed victory. The British lost more ships and twice as many sailors, and the British press criticised the Grand Fleet's failure to force a decisive outcome, but Scheer's plan of destroying a substantial portion of the British fleet also failed. The Germans [[fleet in being|continued to pose a threat]], requiring the British to keep their battleships concentrated in the North Sea, but the battle confirmed the German policy of avoiding all fleet-to-fleet contact, and instead, the German Navy turned its efforts and resources to [[unrestricted submarine warfare]] and the destruction of Allied and neutral shipping. Subsequent reviews commissioned by the Royal Navy generated strong disagreement between supporters of Jellicoe and Beatty, and the two admirals' performance in the battle; this debate continues today.

==Background and planning==
===German planning===
With 16 [[dreadnought]] class battleships, compared with the Royal Navy's 28, the [[German High Seas Fleet]] stood little chance of winning a head-to-head clash. The Germans therefore adopted a divide-and-conquer strategy: staging raids into the North Sea and bombarding the English coast. The aim was to lure out small British squadrons and pickets, which could then be destroyed by superior forces or submarines.

In January 1916, Admiral [[Hugo von Pohl|von Pohl]], commander of the German Fleet, fell ill. He was replaced by Scheer, who believed that the fleet had been used too defensively, had better ships and men than the British, and ought to take the war to them.&lt;ref&gt;Tarrant p.49&lt;/ref&gt; According to Scheer, the German [[naval strategy]] should be:

{{quote |to damage the English Fleet by offensive raids against the naval forces engaged in watching and blockading the [[Heligoland Bight|German Bight]], as well as by [[naval mine|mine]]-laying on the British coast and [[submarine]] attack, whenever possible. After an equality of strength had been realised as a result of these operations, and all our forces had been made ready and concentrated, an attempt was to be made with our fleet to seek battle under circumstances unfavourable to the enemy.}}
[[Image:Scheer.JPG|thumb|right|upright|[[Reinhard Scheer]], German fleet commander]]

On 25 April, a decision was made by the German admiralty to halt indiscriminate attacks by submarine on merchant shipping. This followed protests from neutral countries, notably the United States, that their nationals had been the victims of attacks. Germany agreed that future attacks would only take place in accord with internationally agreed prize rules, which required an attacker to give a warning and allow the crews of vessels time to escape, and not to attack at all neutral vessels. Scheer believed that it would not be possible to continue attacks on these terms, which took away the advantage of secret approach by submarines and left them vulnerable to even relatively small guns on the target ships. Instead, he set about deploying the submarine fleet against military vessels.&lt;ref&gt;Tarrant p.55&lt;/ref&gt;

It was hoped that, following a successful German submarine attack, fast British escorts, such as [[destroyers]], would be tied down by anti-submarine operations. If the Germans could catch the British in the expected locations, there were thought to be good prospects of at least partially redressing the balance of forces between the fleets. &quot;After the British sortied in response to the raiding attack force&quot; the Royal Navy's centuries-old instincts for aggressive action could be exploited to draw its weakened units towards the main German fleet under Scheer. The hope was that Scheer would thus be able to ambush a section of the British fleet and destroy it.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

====Submarine deployments====
A plan was devised to station submarines offshore from British naval bases, and then stage some action that would draw out the British ships to the waiting submarines. The battlecruiser ''Seydlitz'' had been damaged in a previous engagement, but was due to be repaired by mid May, so an operation was scheduled for 17 May. At the start of May, difficulties with condensers were discovered on ships of the III battleship squadron, so the operation was put back to 23 May. Ten submarines – ''U-24'', ''U-32'', ''U-43'', ''U-44'', U-47, ''U-51'', ''U-52'', ''U-63'', ''U-66'', and ''U-70'' – were given orders first to patrol in the central north sea between 17 and 22 May, and then to take up waiting positions. ''U-43'' and ''U-44'' were stationed in the Pentland Firth, which the Grand Fleet was likely to cross leaving Scapa Flow, while the remainder proceeded to the Firth of Forth, awaiting battlecruisers departing Rosyth. Each boat had an allocated area, which they could move around as necessary to avoid detection but they were instructed to keep within it. During the initial North sea patrol the ships were instructed to sail only north-south so that any enemy who chanced to encounter one would believe they were departing or returning from operations on the west coast (which required them to pass around the north of Britain). Once at their final positions, the ships were under strict orders to avoid premature detection that might give away the operation. It was arranged that a coded signal would be transmitted to alert the submarines exactly when the operation commenced, 'Take into account the enemy's forces may be putting to sea'.&lt;ref&gt;Tarrant p. 56-57&lt;/ref&gt; 

Additionally, ''UB-27'' was sent out on 20 May with instructions to work her way into the Firth of Forth past May Island. ''U-46'' was ordered to patrol the coast of [[Sunderland, Tyne and Wear|Sunderland]], which had been chosen for the diversionary attack, but because of engine problems she was unable to leave port and ''U-47'' was diverted to this task. On 13 May, ''U-72'' was sent to lay mines in the Firth of Forth, on 23rd ''U-74'' departed to lay mines in the Moray Firth, and on the 24th, ''U-75'' was dispatched similarly west of the Orkney islands. ''UB-21'' and ''UB-22'' were sent to patrol the Humber, where (incorrect) reports had suggested the presence of British warships. ''U-22'', ''U-46'' and ''U-67'' were positioned north of Terschelling to protect against intervention by British light forces stationed at Harwich.&lt;ref&gt;Tarrant p.57-58&lt;/ref&gt;  

On 22 May, it was discovered that ''Seydlitz'' was still not watertight after repairs and would not now be ready until the 29th. The ambush submarines were now on station and experiencing difficulties of their own: visibility near the coast was frequently poor due to fog, and sea conditions were either so calm the slightest ripple, as from the periscope, could give away their position, or so rough as to make it very hard to keep the vessel at a steady depth. The British had become aware of unusual submarine activity, and had begun counter patrols that forced the submarines out of position. ''UB-27'' passed Bell Rock on the night of 23 May on its way into the Firth of Forth as planned, but was halted by engine trouble. After repairs she continued to approach, following behind merchant vessels and reached Largo Bay on 25 May. There the ship became entangled in nets that fouled one of the propellers, forcing them to abandon the operation and return home. ''U-74'' was detected by four armed trawlers on 27 May and sunk {{convert|25|mi|nmi km|lk=on|abbr=on}} south east of Peterhead. ''U75'' laid her mines off the Orkney islands, which although they played no part in the battle, were responsible later for sinking the cruiser ''Hampshire'' carrying Lord Kitchener (head of the army) on a mission to Russia on 5 June. ''U-72'' was forced to abandon her mission without laying any mines when an oil leak meant she was laying a visible surface trail astern.&lt;ref&gt;Tarrant p.58-60&lt;/ref&gt;

====Zeppelins====
The Germans maintained a fleet of [[Zeppelin]]s that they used for aerial reconnaissance and occasional bombing raids. The planned raid on Sunderland intended using Zeppelins to watch out for the British fleet approaching from the north, which might otherwise surprise the raiders.

By 28 May, strong north easterly winds meant that it would not be possible to send out the Zeppelins, so the raid again had to be postponed. The submarines could only stay on station until 1 June before their supplies would be exhausted and they had orders to return, so a decision had to be made quickly about the raid.

It was decided to use an alternative plan, abandoning the attack on Sunderland but instead sending a patrol of battlecruisers to the [[Skagerrak]] (the sea between Norway and Denmark) where it was likely they would encounter merchant ships carrying British cargo and British cruiser patrols. It was felt this could be done without air support, because the action would now be much closer to Germany, relying instead on cruiser and torpedo boat patrols for reconnaissance.

Orders for the alternative plan were issued on 28 May, though still hoping that last minute improvements in the weather would allow the original plan to go ahead. The German fleet assembled in the [[Jade (river)|Jade river]] and at [[Wilhelmshaven]] was instructed to raise steam and be ready for action from midnight on 28 May.&lt;ref&gt;Tarrant p.61&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R10687, Vizeadmiral Hipper mit Stab cropped.png|thumb|left|upright|[[Franz von Hipper|Franz Hipper]], commander of the German battlecruiser squadron]]

By 14:00 on 30 May, the wind was still too strong and the final decision was made to go with the alternative plan. The coded signal '31 May G.G.2490' was transmitted to the fleet to inform them the Skagerrak attack would start on 31 May. The pre-arranged signal to the waiting submarines was transmitted throughout the day from the E-Dienst radio station at [[Brugges]], and the U-boat tender ''Arcona'' anchored at [[Emden]]. Only two of the waiting submarines, ''[[SM U-66|U-66]]'' and ''[[SM U-32 (Germany)|U-32]]'' received the order.&lt;ref&gt;Tarrant p.62, 60,65&lt;/ref&gt;

===British response===
Unfortunately for the German plan, the British had obtained a copy of the main German code book from the light cruiser {{SMS|Magdeburg||6}}, which had been boarded by the [[Russian Navy]] after the ship ran aground in Russian [[territorial waters]] in 1914. German naval radio communications could therefore usually be quickly deciphered, and the British [[Admiralty]] usually knew about German activities.

The British Admiralty's [[Room 40]] maintained [[direction finding]] and interception of German naval signals. It had intercepted and decrypted a German signal on 28 May ordering all ships to be ready for sea on the 30th.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Further signals were intercepted and although they were not decrypted it was clear that a major operation was likely. At 11:00 on 30 May, Jellicoe was warned that the German fleet seemed prepared to sail the following morning. By 17:00, the Admiralty had intercepted the signal from Scheer, '31 May G.G.2490', making it clear something significant was imminent.&lt;ref&gt;Tarrant p.63-64&lt;/ref&gt;

Not knowing the Germans' objective, Jellicoe and his staff decided to position the fleet to head off any attempt by the Germans to enter the North Atlantic, or the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] through the Skagerrak, by taking up a position off Norway where they could possibly cut off any German raid into the shipping lanes of the Atlantic, or prevent the Germans from heading into the Baltic. A position further west was unnecessary as that area of the [[North Sea]] could be patrolled by air using blimps and scouting aircraft.
[[Image:John Jellicoe - Project Gutenberg eText 16363.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[John Jellicoe, 1st Earl Jellicoe|John Jellicoe]], British fleet commander]]

Consequently, Admiral Jellicoe led the 16 dreadnought battleships of the 1st and 4th Battle Squadrons of the Grand Fleet and three battlecruisers of the 3rd Battlecruiser Squadron eastwards out of [[Scapa Flow]] at 22:30 on 30 May. He was to meet the 2nd battle squadron of eight more dreadnought battleships commanded by Vice-Admiral [[Martyn Jerram]] coming from Cromarty. Hipper's raiding force did not leave the [[Jade Estuary|Outer Jade Roads]] until 01:00 on 31 May heading west of Heligoland island following a cleared channel through the minefields, heading north at {{convert|16|kn|mph km/h|lk=on|abbr=on}}. The main German fleet of 16 dreadnought battleships of I and III Battle Squadrons left the jade at 02:30, being joined off Heligoland at 04:00 by the six pre-dreadnoughts of the II Battle Squadron coming from the Elbe river. Beatty's faster force of six ships of the 1st and 4th battlecruiser squadrons plus the 5th battle squadron of four fast battleships left the [[Firth of Forth]] on the next day,{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} and Jellicoe's intention was to rendezvous with him {{convert|90|mi|nmi km|abbr=on}} west of the mouth of the Skagerrak off the coast of Jutland and wait for the Germans or for their intentions to become clear. The planned position gave him the widest range of responses to likely German intentions.&lt;ref&gt;Tarrant p.64&lt;/ref&gt;

==Naval tactics in 1916==

The principle of [[Force concentration|concentration of force]] was fundamental to the fleet tactics of this period (as in earlier periods). Tactical doctrine called for a fleet approaching battle to be in a compact formation of parallel columns, allowing relatively easy manoeuvring, and giving shortened sight lines within the formation, which made easier the passing of the signals necessary for command and control.

It was a fundamental advantage of such a formation that a fleet formed in several short columns could change its heading faster than one formed in a single long column. Since most command signals in this era were made by visible means, usually made with [[flag]]s or shuttered [[searchlight]]s between ships, the flagship was usually placed at the head of the centre column so that its signals might be more easily seen by the many ships of the formation. Wireless telegraphy was in use though security (radio direction finding), encryption, and the limitation of the radio sets, made their extensive use more problematic. Command and control of such huge fleets remained incredibly difficult.&lt;ref&gt;Sutherland, Cramwell, p.13&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, it might take a very long time for a signal from the flagship to be relayed to the entire formation. It was usually necessary for a signal to be confirmed by each ship before it could be relayed to other ships, and an order for a fleet movement would have to be received and acknowledged by every ship before it could be executed. In a large single-column formation, a signal could take 10 minutes or more to be passed from one end of the line to the other, whereas in a formation of parallel columns, visibility across the diagonals was often better (and always shorter) than in a single long column, and the diagonals gave signal &quot;redundancy&quot;, increasing the probability that a message would be quickly seen and correctly interpreted.
[[Image:Grand Fleet sails.jpg|thumb|The British Grand Fleet steaming in parallel columns at the outbreak of war in 1914]]

However, before battle was joined the heavy units of the fleet would, if possible, deploy into a single column. To form the battle-line in the correct orientation relative to the enemy, the commanding admiral had to know the enemy fleet's distance, bearing, heading, and speed. It was the task of the scouting forces, consisting primarily of [[battlecruiser]]s and [[cruiser]]s, to find the enemy and to report this information in sufficient time, and, if possible, to deny the enemy's scouting forces the opportunity of obtaining the equivalent information.

Ideally, the battle-line would cross the intended path of the enemy column so that the maximum number of [[gun]]s could be brought to bear, while the enemy could fire only with the forward guns of the leading ships, a manoeuvre known as &quot;[[crossing the T]]&quot;. Admiral [[Tōgō Heihachirō|Tōgō]], commander of the Japanese battleship fleet had achieved this against Admiral [[Rozhestvensky]]'s Russian battleships in 1905 at the [[Battle of Tsushima]], with devastating results.&lt;ref&gt;Forczyk p. 58-62&lt;/ref&gt; Jellicoe was to achieve this twice in one hour against the High Seas Fleet at Jutland, but on both occasions Scheer managed to turn away and disengage, thereby avoiding a decisive action.

===Ship design===
Within the existing technological limits, a trade-off had to be made between the weight and size of guns, the weight of armour protecting the ship, and the maximum speed. Battleships sacrificed speed for armour and heavy naval guns ({{convert|11|in|mm|abbr=on}} or larger). British battlecruisers sacrificed weight of armour for greater speed, while their German counterparts were armed with lighter guns. These weight savings allowed them to escape danger or catch other ships. Generally, the larger guns mounted on British ships allowed an engagement at greater range. In theory, a lightly armoured ship could stay out of range of a slower opponent while still scoring hits. The fast pace of development in the pre-war years meant that every few years a new generation of ships rendered its predecessors obsolete. Thus, fairly young ships could still be obsolete compared to the newest ships, and fare badly in an engagement against them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Castles666&quot;&gt;'Castles of Steel' p. 666&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Fisher, 1st Baron Fisher|Admiral John Fisher]], responsible for reconstruction of the British fleet in the pre-war period, favoured large guns and speed. [[Alfred von Tirpitz|Admiral Tirpitz]], responsible for the German fleet, favoured unsinkable ships and chose to sacrifice some gun size for improved armour. The German battlecruiser ''Derfflinger'' had [[belt armour]] equivalent in thickness – though not in terms of comprehensiveness – to the British battleship ''Iron Duke'', significantly better than on the British battlecruisers such as ''Tiger''. German ships had better internal subdivision and had fewer doors and other weak points in their [[bulkhead (partition)|bulkheads]], but with the disadvantage that space for crew was greatly reduced.&lt;ref name=&quot;Castles666&quot;/&gt; As they were only designed for cruises in the North Sea, they did not need to be as habitable as the British vessels, and their crews could live in barracks ashore when in harbour.&lt;ref&gt;Marder III p.168&lt;/ref&gt;

Jellicoe's [[Grand Fleet]] was split into two sections. The dreadnought Battle Fleet with which he sailed formed the main force and was composed of 24 battleships and three battlecruisers. The battleships were formed into three squadrons of eight ships, further subdivided into divisions of four, each led by a [[flag officer]]. Accompanying them were eight [[armoured cruiser]]s (classified by the Royal Navy since 1913 as &quot;cruisers&quot;), eight [[light cruiser]]s, four [[scout cruiser]]s, 51 [[destroyer]]s, and one [[destroyer-minelayer]].&lt;ref&gt;Jellicoe, Joe, The Grand Fleet, 1914–1916, London, Cassell, 1919&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Nw beatty 01.png|thumb|left|upright|[[David Beatty, 1st Earl Beatty|David Beatty]] commander British battlecruiser squadron]]

The Grand Fleet sailed without three of its battleships: ''Emperor of India'' in refit at Invergordon, ''Queen Elizabeth'' drydocked at [[Rosyth Dockyard|Rosyth]] and ''Dreadnought'' in refit at Devonport. The brand new ''Royal Sovereign'' was left behind, with only three weeks in service, her untrained crew judged unready for battle.

British [[reconnaissance]] was provided by the Battlecruiser Fleet under David Beatty: six battlecruisers, four fast [[Queen Elizabeth class battleship|''Queen Elizabeth''-class battleship]]s, 14 light cruisers and 27 destroyers. Air scouting was provided for by the attachment of the [[seaplane tender]] {{HMS|Engadine|1911|6}}, one of the first [[aircraft carrier]]s in history to participate in a naval engagement.&lt;ref name=Camp-26&gt;{{cite book |title=Analysis |last=Campbell |pages=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The German High Seas Fleet under Scheer was also split into a main force and a separate reconnaissance force. Scheer's main battle fleet was composed of 16 battleships and six [[Pre-dreadnought battleship|pre-dreadnought]] battleships arranged in an identical manner to the British. With them were six light cruisers and 31 [[torpedo-boat]]s.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

The German scouting force, commanded by Franz Hipper, consisted of five battlecruisers, five light cruisers and 30 torpedo-boats. The Germans had no equivalent to ''Engadine'', and no [[aircraft|heavier-than-air aircraft]] to operate with the fleet, but had the Imperial German Naval Airship Service's force of [[rigid airship]]s available to patrol the North Sea.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

The British capital ships carried a larger number of guns and a correspondingly larger weight of broadside than their German counterparts; {{convert|332360|lb|kg|abbr=on}} as compared to {{convert|134216|lb|kg|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;Tarrant p.65&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the battleships and battlecruisers on both sides also carried [[torpedo]]es of various sizes, as did the lighter craft.&lt;ref name=Camp-26/&gt;

The German battle fleet was hampered by the slow speed and relatively poor armament of the six pre-dreadnoughts of II Squadron, which limited maximum fleet speed to {{convert|18|kn|mph km/h|abbr=on}}, compared to maximum British fleet speed of {{convert|21|kn|mph km/h|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=Camp-16&gt;{{cite book |title=Analysis |last=Campbell |pages=16–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the British side, the eight armoured cruisers were deficient in both speed and armour protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Analysis |last=Campbell |pages=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these obsolete squadrons were notably vulnerable to attacks by more modern enemy ships.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

==Battlecruiser action==
The route of the British battlecruiser fleet took it through the patrol sector allocated to ''U-32''. After receiving the order to commence the operation, ''U-32'' moved to a position {{convert|80|mi|nmi km|abbr=on}} east of May Island at dawn on 31 May. At 03:40, she sighted the cruisers {{HMS|Galatea|1914|6}} and {{HMS|Phaeton|1914|2}} leaving the Forth at {{convert|18|kn|mph km/h|abbr=on}}. She fired one torpedo at the leading cruiser at a range of {{convert|1000|yd|m|abbr=on}}, but her periscope jammed 'up', giving away the position of the submarine as she manoeuvred to fire a second. The lead cruiser turned away to dodge the torpedo, while the second turned towards the submarine attempting to ram. ''U-32'' crash-dived, and on raising periscope at 04:10 saw two battlecruisers (the 2nd Battlecruiser Squadron) heading southeast. They were too far away to attack, but ''Kapitänleutnant'' von Spiegel reported the sighting of two battleships and two cruisers to Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Tarrant p.65-66&lt;/ref&gt;

''U-66'' was also supposed to be patrolling off the Firth of Forth, but had been forced north to a position {{convert|60|mi|nmi km|abbr=on}} off Peterhead by patrolling British vessels. This now brought her into contact with the 2nd Battle Squadron, coming from the Moray Firth. At 05:00, she had to crash dive when the cruiser {{HMS|Duke of Edinburgh||2}} appeared from the mist heading toward her. This was followed by another cruiser {{HMS|Boadicea|1908|2}} and eight battleships. ''U-66'' got within {{convert|350|yd|m|abbr=on}} of the battleships preparing to fire, but was forced to dive by an approaching destroyer and missed the opportunity. At 06:35, she reported eight battleships and cruisers heading north.&lt;ref&gt;Tarrant p. 66-67&lt;/ref&gt;

The courses reported by both submarines were incorrect, because they reflected one leg of a zig-zag being used by British ships to avoid submarines. Taken with a wireless intercept of more ships leaving Scapa Flow earlier in the night, the impression was given in the German high command that the British fleet, whatever it was doing, was split into separate sections moving apart, which was precisely as the Germans wished to meet it.&lt;ref&gt;Tarrant p.67&lt;/ref&gt;

Jellicoe's ships proceeded to their rendezvous undamaged and undiscovered. However, he was now misled by an Admiralty [[intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]] report, advising that the German main battlefleet was still in port.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Analysis |last=Campbell |pages=28–29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Director of Operations Division, Rear Admiral [[Thomas Jackson (Royal Navy officer)|Thomas Jackson]] had asked the intelligence division, [[Room 40]], for the current location of German call sign DK, used by Admiral Scheer. They had replied that it was currently transmitting from [[Wilhelmshaven]]. It was known to the intelligence staff that Scheer deliberately used a different call sign when at sea, but no one asked for this information or explained the reason behind the query, to locate the German fleet.&lt;ref&gt;Marder III p.41-42&lt;/ref&gt;

The German battlecruisers cleared the minefields surrounding the Amrum swept channel by 09:00. They then proceeded northwest, passing {{convert|35|mi|nmi km|abbr=on}} west of the Horn's Reef lightship heading for the [[Little Fisher Bank]] at the mouth of the Skagerrak. The High Seas Fleet followed some {{convert|50|mi|nmi km|abbr=on}} behind. The battlecruisers were in line ahead, with the four cruisers of the II scouting group plus supporting torpedo boats ranged in an arc {{convert|8|mi|nmi km|abbr=on}} ahead and to either side. The IX torpedo boat flotilla formed close support immediately surrounding the battlecruisers. The High Seas Fleet similarly adopted a line ahead formation, with close screening by torpedo boats either side and a further screen of five cruisers surrounding the column {{convert|5|-|8|mi|nmi km|abbr=on}} away. Winds had finally moderated so that Zepelins could be used, and by 11:30 five had been sent out: ''L14'' to the Skagerrak, ''L23'' {{convert|240|mi|nmi km|abbr=on}} east of Noss Head in the Pentland Firth, ''L21'' {{convert|120|mi|nmi km|abbr=on}} off Peterhead, ''L9'' {{convert|100|mi|nmi km|abbr=on}} off Sunderland, and ''L16'' {{convert|80|mi|nmi km|abbr=on}} east of Flamborough Head. Visibility, however, was still bad with cloud down to {{convert|1000|ft|m|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;Tarrant p.69-70&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contact===
By around 14:00, Beatty's ships were proceeding eastward at roughly the same latitude as Hipper's squadron, which was heading north. Had the courses remained unchanged, Beatty would have passed between the two German fleets, {{convert|40|mi|nmi km|abbr=on}} south of the battlecruisers and {{convert|20|mi|nmi km|abbr=on}} north of the High Seas Fleet at around 16:30, possibly trapping his ships just as the German plan envisioned. However, his orders were to stop his scouting patrol when he reached a point {{convert|260|mi|nmi km|abbr=on}} east of Britain and then turn north to meet Jellicoe, which he did at this time. Beatty's ships were divided into three columns, with the two battlecruiser squadrons leading in parallel lines {{convert|3|mi|nmi km|abbr=on}} apart. The 5th Battle Squadron was stationed {{convert|5|mi|nmi km|abbr=on}} to the northwest, on the side furthest away from any expected enemy contact, while a screen of cruisers and destroyers was spread southeast of the battlecruisers. After the turn, the 5th Battle Squadron was now leading the British ships in the west-most column, Beatty's squadron was centre and rearmost, with the 2nd BCS to the west.&lt;ref&gt;Tarrant p.70-71&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Jutland battlecruiser action.png|400px|thumb|(1) 15:22 hrs, Hipper sights Beatty. &lt;br/&gt;(2) 15:48 hrs, First shots fired by Hipper's squadron.&lt;br/&gt;(3) 16:00 hrs-16:05 hrs, ''Indefatigable'' explodes, leaving two survivors. &lt;br/&gt;(4) 16:25 hrs, ''Queen Mary'' explodes, nine survive. &lt;br/&gt;(5) 16:45 hrs, Beatty's battlecruisers move out of range of Hipper.&lt;br/&gt;(6) 16:54 hrs, Evan-Thomas' battleships turn north behind Beatty.]]

At 14:20 on 31 May, despite heavy haze and [[Scud (cloud)|scuds]] of fog giving poor visibility, scouts from Beatty's force reported enemy ships to the southeast; the British light units, investigating a neutral Danish [[Steamboat|steamer]] (''N J Fjord''), which was stopped between the two fleets, had found two German [[destroyer]]s engaged in the same mission (''B109'' and ''B110''). The first shots of the battle were fired at 14:28 when {{HMS|Galatea|1914|6}} and {{HMS|Phaeton|1914|2}} of the British 1st Light [[Cruiser Squadron]] opened on the German destroyers, which withdrew toward their own approaching light cruisers. At 14:36, the Germans scored the first hit of the battle when {{SMS|Elbing||6}}, of Rear-Admiral [[Friedrich Bödicker]]'s Scouting Group II, hit her British counterpart ''Galatea'' at extreme range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Analysis |last=Campbell |pages=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile Beatty began to move his battlecruisers and supporting forces southeastwards and then east to cut the German ships off from their base, and ordered ''Engadine'' to launch a [[seaplane]] to try to get more information about the size and location of the German forces. This was the first time in history that a carrier-based aeroplane was used for reconnaissance in naval combat. ''Engadine''{{'}}s plane did locate and report some German light cruisers just before 15:30, and received anti-aircraft gunfire, but attempts to relay the plane's reports failed.&lt;ref name=Camp-35&gt;{{cite book |title=Analysis |last=Campbell |pages=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unfortunately for Beatty, his initial course changes at 14:32 were not received by [[Hugh Evan-Thomas|Sir Hugh Evan-Thomas's]] [[5th Battle Squadron]] (it being too far away to read his flags), because the battlecruiser {{HMS|Tiger|1913|6}} – the last ship in his column – was no longer in a position where it could relay signals by searchlight to Evan-Thomas, as it had previously been ordered to do. Whereas before the north turn, ''Tiger'' had been the closest ship to Evan-Thomas, she was now further away than Beatty on ''Lion''. Matters were aggravated because Evan-Thomas had not been briefed regarding standing orders within Beatty's Squadron, as his squadron normally operated with the Grand Fleet. Fleet ships were expected to obey movement orders precisely and not deviate from them. Beatty's standing instructions expected his officers to use initiative and keep position with the flagship.&lt;ref&gt;'Marder' III p.55&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the four ''Queen Elizabeth''-class battleships – which were the fastest and most heavily-armed in the world at that time – remained on the previous course for several minutes, ending up {{convert|10|mi|nmi km|abbr=on}} behind rather than five.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Analysis |last=Campbell |pages=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beatty also had opportunity during the previous hours to concentrate his forces, and no reason not to do so, whereas he steamed ahead at full speed faster than the battleships could manage. Dividing the force had serious consequences for the British, costing them what would have been an overwhelming advantage in ships and firepower during the first half-hour of the coming battle.&lt;ref name=Camp-35/&gt;

With visibility favouring the Germans, at 15:22 Hipper's battlecruisers steaming approximately northwest, sighted Beatty's squadron at a range of about {{convert|15|mi|nmi km|abbr=on}}, while Beatty's forces did not identify Hipper's battlecruisers until 15:30. &lt;span style=&quot;background: lightblue&quot;&gt;(position 1 on map)&lt;/span&gt;. At 15:45, Hipper turned southeast to lead Beatty toward [[Reinhard Scheer|Scheer]], who was {{convert|46|mi|nmi km|abbr=on}} southeast with the main force of the High Seas Fleet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Analysis |last=Campbell |pages=34–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Run to the South===
Beatty's conduct during the next 15 minutes has received a great deal of criticism, as his ships out-ranged and outnumbered the German squadron, yet he held his fire for over 10 minutes with the German ships in range. He also failed to use the time available to rearrange his battlecruisers into a fighting formation, with the result that they were still manoeuvring when the battle started.&lt;ref&gt;Brooks p. 234-237&lt;/ref&gt;

At 15:48, with the opposing forces roughly parallel at {{convert|15000|yd|m|abbr=on}}, with the British to the southwest of the Germans (i.e. on the right side), Hipper opened fire, followed by the British ships as their guns came to bear upon targets &lt;span style=&quot;background:lightblue&quot;&gt;(position 2)&lt;/span&gt;. Thus began the opening phase of the battlecruiser action, known as the &quot;Run to the South&quot;, in which the British chased the Germans, and Hipper intentionally led Beatty toward Scheer. During the first minutes of the ensuing battle, all the British ships except ''Princess Royal'' fired far over their German opponents, due to adverse visibility conditions, before finally getting the range. Only ''Lion'' and ''Princess Royal'' had settled into formation, so the other four ships were hampered in aiming by their own turning. Beatty was to windward of Hipper, and therefore funnel and gun smoke from his own ships tended to obscure his targets, while Hipper's smoke blew clear. Also, the eastern sky was overcast and the grey German ships were indistinct and difficult to range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Analysis |last=Campbell |pages=38–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beatty had ordered his ships to engage in a line, one British ship engaging with one German and his [[flagship]] {{HMS|Lion|1910|6}} doubling on the German flagship {{SMS|Lützow||6}}. However, due to another mistake with signalling by flag, and possibly that ''Queen Mary'' and ''Tiger'' were unable to see the German lead ship because of smoke,&lt;ref&gt;Brooks p. 239&lt;/ref&gt; the second German ship, ''Derfflinger'', was left unengaged and free to fire without disruption. {{SMS|Moltke|1910|6}} drew fire from two of Beatty's battlecruisers, but still fired with deadly accuracy during this time, putting nine shells into ''Tiger'' in the first 12 minutes. The Germans drew first blood. Aided by superior visibility, Hipper's five battlecruisers quickly registered hits on three of the six British battlecruisers. Seven minutes passed before the British managed to score their first hit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Analysis |last=Campbell |pages=39–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first near-kill of the Run to the South occurred at 16:00, when a {{convert|12|in|mm|abbr=on}} salvo from ''Lützow'' wrecked the &quot;Q&quot; turret amidships on Beatty's flagship ''Lion''. Dozens of crewmen were instantly killed, but far larger destruction was averted when the mortally wounded turret commander – Major [[Francis John William Harvey|Francis Harvey]] of the [[Royal Marines]] – promptly ordered the magazine doors shut and the magazine flooded. This prevented a massive magazine explosion at 16:28, when a flash fire ignited ready cordite charges beneath the turret and killed everyone in the chambers outside &quot;Q&quot; magazine. ''Lion'' was saved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Analysis |last=Campbell |pages=64–66}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{HMS|Indefatigable|1909|6}} was not so lucky; at 16:02, just 14 minutes into the slugging match, she was smashed aft by three {{convert|11|in|mm|abbr=on}} shells from {{SMS|Von der Tann||6}}, causing damage sufficient to knock her out of line and detonating &quot;X&quot; magazine aft. Soon after, despite the near-maximum range, ''Von der Tann'' put another {{convert|11|in|mm|abbr=on}} salvo on ''Indefatigable''{{'}}s &quot;A&quot; turret forward. The plunging shells probably pierced the thin upper armour and seconds later ''Indefatigable'' was ripped apart by another magazine explosion, sinking immediately with her crew of 1,019 officers and men, leaving only two survivors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Analysis |last=Campbell |pages=60–61}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;background:lightblue&quot;&gt;(position 3)&lt;/span&gt;.

Hipper's position deteriorated somewhat by 16:15 as the 5th Battle Squadron finally came into range, so that he had to contend with gunfire from the four battleships astern as well as Beatty's five remaining battlecruisers to starboard. But he knew his baiting mission was close to completion, as his force was rapidly closing with Scheer's main body. At 16:08, the lead battleship of the 5th Battle Squadron, {{HMS|Barham|1914|6}}, caught up with Hipper and opened fire at extreme range, scoring a {{convert|15|in|mm|abbr=on}} hit on ''Von der Tann'' within 60 seconds. Still, it was 16:15 before all the battleships of the 5th were able to fully engage at long range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Analysis |last=Campbell |pages=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At 16:25, the battlecruiser action intensified again when {{HMS|Queen Mary||6}} was hit by what may have been a combined salvo from ''Derfflinger'' and {{SMS|Seydlitz||2}}; she disintegrated when both forward magazines exploded, sinking with all but nine of her 1,275 man crew lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Analysis |last=Campbell |pages=62–64}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;background:lightblue&quot;&gt;(position 4)&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;!-- Campbell p. 47 says 20 survivors picked up but that would mean a crew of 1286 since he says 1266 were lost. --&gt;Commander von Hase, the first gunnery officer aboard ''Derfflingler'', noted that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The enemy was shooting superbly. Twice the ''Derfflinger'' came under their infernal hail and each time she was hit. But the ''Queen Mary'' was having a bad time; engaged by the ''Seydlitz'' as well as the ''Derfflinger'', she met her doom at 1626. A vivid red flame shot up from her forepart; then came an explosion forward, followed by a much heavier explosion amidships. Immediately afterwards, she blew up with a terrific explosion, the masts collapsing inwards and the smoke hiding everything.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, p187&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During the Run to the South, from 15:48 to 16:54, the German battlecruisers made an estimated total of forty-two {{convert|11|in|mm|abbr=on}} and {{convert|12|in|mm|abbr=on}} hits on the British battlecruisers (nine on ''Lion'', six on ''Princess Royal'', seven on ''Queen Mary'', 14 on ''Tiger'', one on ''New Zealand'', five on ''Indefatigable''), and two more on the battleship ''Barham'', compared with only eleven {{convert|13.5|in|mm|abbr=on}} hits by the British battlecruisers (four on ''Lützow'', four on ''Seydlitz'', two on ''Moltke'', one on ''von der Tann''), and six {{convert|15|in|mm|abbr=on}} hits by the battleships (one on ''Seydlitz'', four on ''Moltke'', one on ''von der Tann'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Analysis |last=Campbell |pages=78, 94}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:HMS Lion (1910).jpg|thumb|left|[[David Beatty, 1st Earl Beatty|Beatty's]] flagship ''Lion'' burning after being hit by a salvo from ''Lützow'']]

===Two points to port===
Shortly after, a salvo struck on or around {{HMS|Princess Royal|1911|6}}, which was obscured by spray and smoke from shell bursts. A signalman promptly leapt onto the bridge of ''Lion'' and announced &quot;''Princess Royal''{{'}}s blown up, Sir.&quot; Beatty famously turned to his [[flag captain]], saying &quot;[[Ernle Chatfield, 1st Baron Chatfield|Chatfield]], there seems to be something wrong with our bloody ships today.&quot; (In popular legend, Beatty also immediately ordered his ships to &quot;turn two points to port&quot;, i.e. two [[Compass point|points]] nearer the enemy, but there is no official record of any such command or course change.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Castles |last=Massie |pages=596}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Princess Royal'', as it turned out, was still afloat after the spray cleared.

At 16:30, Scheer's leading battleships sighted the distant battlecruiser action; soon after, {{HMS|Southampton|1912|6}} of Beatty's 2nd [[Light Cruiser]] Squadron led by Commodore [[William Goodenough]] sighted the main body of Scheer's High Seas Fleet, dodging numerous heavy-calibre salvos to report in detail the German strength: 16 dreadnoughts with six older battleships. This was the first news that Beatty and Jellicoe had that Scheer and his battlefleet were even at sea. Simultaneously, an all-out destroyer action raged in the space between the opposing battlecruiser forces, as British and German destroyers fought with each other and attempted to torpedo the larger enemy ships. Each side fired many torpedoes, but both battlecruiser forces turned away from the attacks and all escaped harm except ''Seydlitz'', which was hit forward at 16:57 by a torpedo fired by the British destroyer {{HMS|Petard|1916|6}}. Though taking on water, ''Seydlitz'' maintained speed. The destroyer {{HMS|Nestor|1915|6}}, under the command of [[Edward Bingham|Captain Barry Bingham]], led the British attacks. The British disabled the German torpedo boat ''V27'', which the Germans soon abandoned and sank, and ''Petard'' then torpedoed and sank ''V29'', her second score of the day. ''S35'' and ''V26'' rescued the crews of their sunken sister ships. But ''Nestor'' and another British destroyer – {{HMS|Nomad|1916|6}} – were immobilised by shell hits, and were later sunk by Scheer's passing dreadnoughts. Bingham was rescued, and won the Victoria Cross for his leadership in the destroyer action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Analysis |last=Campbell |pages=50–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Run to the North===
As soon as he himself sighted the vanguard of Scheer's distant battleship line {{convert|12|mi|nmi km|abbr=on}} away, at 16:40, Beatty turned his battlecruiser force 180°, heading north to draw the Germans toward Jellicoe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Analysis |last=Campbell |pages=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;background:lightblue&quot;&gt;(position 5)&lt;/span&gt;. Beatty's withdrawal toward Jellicoe is called the &quot;Run to the North&quot;, in which the tables turned and the Germans chased the British. Because Beatty once again failed to signal his intentions adequately, the battleships of the 5th Battle Squadron – which were too far behind to read his flags – found themselves passing the battlecruisers on an opposing course and heading directly toward the approaching main body of the High Seas Fleet. At 16:48, at extreme range, Scheer's leading battleships opened fire.&lt;ref name=Camp-54&gt;{{cite book |title=Analysis |last=Campbell |pages=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, at 16:47, having received Goodenough's signal and knowing that Beatty was now leading the German battlefleet north to him, Jellicoe signalled to his own forces that the fleet action they had waited so long for was finally imminent; at 16:51, by radio, he so informed the Admiralty in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Analysis |last=Campbell |pages=58–59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The difficulties of the 5th Battle Squadron were compounded when Beatty repeated the order to Evan-Thomas to &quot;turn in succession&quot; (rather than &quot;turn together&quot;) at 16:48 as the battleships passed him. Evan-Thomas acknowledged the signal, but [[Lieutenant-Commander]] [[Ralph Seymour (naval officer)|Ralph Seymour]], Beatty's [[flag lieutenant]], aggravated the situation when he did not haul down the flags (to execute the signal) for some minutes. At 16:55, when the 5BS had moved within range of the enemy battleships, Evan-Thomas issued his own flag command warning his squadron to expect sudden manoeuvres and to follow his lead, before starting to turn on his own initiative. The order to turn in succession would have resulted in all four ships turning in the same patch of sea as they reached it one by one, giving the High Seas Fleet repeated opportunity with ample time to find the proper range. In the event, the captain of the trailing ship ({{HMS|Malaya|1915|6}}) turned early, mitigating the adverse results.&lt;ref name=Camp-54/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Massie, pp. 600–601&lt;/ref&gt;

For the next hour, the 5th Battle Squadron acted as Beatty's rearguard, drawing fire from all the German ships within range, while by 17:10 Beatty had deliberately eased his own squadron out of range of Hipper's now-superior battlecruiser force to give his damaged ships a respite from the accurate and deadly fire of his foes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Analysis |last=Campbell |pages=96–97}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since visibility and firepower now favoured the Germans, there was no incentive for Beatty to risk further battlecruiser losses when his own gunnery could not be effective: illustrating the imbalance, Beatty's battlecruisers did not score any hits on the Germans in this phase until 17:45,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Analysis |last=Campbell |pages=135 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but they had rapidly received five more before he opened the range (four on ''Lion'', of which three were by ''Lützow'', and one on ''Tiger'' by ''Seydlitz'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Analysis |last=Campbell |pages=124–125, p. 145}}&lt;/ref&gt; Now the only targets the Germans could reach, the ships of the 5th Battle Squadron received simultaneous fire from Hipper's battlecruisers to the east (which HMS ''Barham'' and {{HMS|Valiant|1914|2}} engaged), and from Scheer's leading battleships to the southeast (which {{HMS|Warspite|03|6}} and {{HMS|Malaya||2}} engaged).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Analysis |last=Campbell |pages=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three took hits: ''Barham'' (four by ''Derfflinger''), ''Warspite'' (two by ''Seydlitz''), and ''Malaya'' (seven by the German battleships). Only ''Valiant'' was unscathed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Analysis |last=Campbell |pages=126–133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The four battleships were far better suited to take this sort of pounding than the battlecruisers, and none were lost, though ''Malaya'' suffered heavy damage, an ammunition fire, and heavy crew casualties. At the same time, the {{convert|15|in|mm|abbr=on}} fire of the four British ships was accurate and effective. As the two British squadrons headed north at top speed, eagerly chased by the entire German fleet, the 5th Battle Squadron scored 13 hits on the enemy battlecruisers (four on ''Lützow'', three on ''Derfflinger'', six on ''Seydlitz'') and five on battleships (though only one, on {{SMS|Markgraf||6}}, did any serious damage).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Analysis |last=Campbell |pages=134–145}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;background:lightblue&quot;&gt;(position 6)&lt;/span&gt;.

===The fleets converge===
Jellicoe was now aware that full fleet engagement was nearing, but had insufficient information on the position and course of the Germans. To assist Beatty, early in the battle at about 16:05, Jellicoe had ordered [[Rear-Admiral]] [[Horace Hood]]'s [[3rd Battlecruiser Squadron (United Kingdom)|3rd Battlecruiser Squadron]] to speed ahead to find and support Beatty's force, and Hood was now racing SSE well in advance of Jellicoe's northern force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Analysis |last=Campbell |pages=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sir Robert Arbuthnot, 4th Baronet|Rear-Admiral Arbuthnot]]'s 1st Cruiser Squadron patrolled the van of Jellicoe's main battleship force as it advanced steadily to the southeast.

At 17:33, the armoured cruiser {{HMS|Black Prince|1904|6}} of Arbuthnot's squadron, on the far southwest flank of Jellicoe's force, came within view of {{HMS|Falmouth|1910|6}}, which was about {{convert|5|mi|nmi km|abbr=on}} ahead of Beatty with the 3rd Light Cruiser Squadron, establishing the first visual link between the converging bodies of the Grand Fleet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Analysis |last=Campbell |pages=118}}&lt;/ref&gt; At 17:38, the scout cruiser {{HMS|Chester|1915|6}}, screening Hood's oncoming battlecruisers, was intercepted by the van of the German scouting forces under Rear-Admiral Bödicker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Analysis |last=Campbell |pages=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heavily outnumbered by Bödicker's four light cruisers, ''Chester'' was pounded before being relieved by Hood's heavy units, which swung westward for that purpose. Hood's flagship {{HMS|Invincible|1907|6}} disabled the light cruiser {{SMS|Wiesbaden||6}} shortly after 17:56. ''Wiesbaden'' became a sitting target for most of the British fleet during the next hour, but remained afloat and fired some torpedoes at the passing enemy battleships from long range. Meanwhile, Bödicker's other ships fled toward Hipper and Scheer in the mistaken belief that Hood was leading a larger force of British capital ships from the north and east. A chaotic destroyer action in mist and smoke ensued as German torpedo boats attempted to blunt the arrival of this new formation, but Hood's battlecruisers dodged all the torpedoes fired at them. In this action, after leading a torpedo counterattack, the British destroyer {{HMS|Shark|1912|6}} was disabled, but continued to return fire at numerous passing enemy ships for the next hour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Analysis |last=Campbell |pages=111–115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The fleet action==
===Deployment===
[[Image:Jutland fleet action.png|right|thumb|425px|(1) 18:00 Battlecruisers rejoin respective fleets&lt;br/&gt;(2) 18:15 British fleet deploys into battle line &lt;/br&gt;(3) 18:30 German fleet under fire turns away&lt;/br&gt;(4) 19:00 German fleet turns back&lt;br/&gt;(5) 19:15 German fleet turns away for second time &lt;br/&gt;(6) 20:00&lt;br/&gt;(7) 21:00 Nightfall: Jellicoe assumes night cruising formation]]

In the meantime, Beatty and Evan-Thomas had resumed their engagement with Hipper's battlecruisers, this time with the visual conditions to their advantage. With several of his ships damaged, Hipper turned back toward Scheer at around 18:00, just as Beatty's flagship ''Lion'' was finally sighted from Jellicoe's flagship ''Iron Duke''. Jellicoe twice demanded the latest position of the German battlefleet from Beatty, who could not see the German battleships and failed to respond to the question until 18:14. Meanwhile, Jellicoe received confusing sighting reports of varying accuracy and limited usefulness from light cruisers and battleships on the starboard (southern) flank of his force.&lt;ref name=Camp-120&gt;{{cite book |title=Analysis |last=Campbell |pages=120–121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jellicoe was in a worrying position. He needed to know the location of the German fleet to judge when and how to deploy his battleships from their cruising formation (six columns of four ships each) into a single battle-line. The deployment could be on either the westernmost or the easternmost column, and had to be carried out before the Germans arrived; but early deployment could mean losing any chance of a decisive encounter. Deploying to the west would bring his fleet closer to Scheer, gaining valuable time as dusk approached, but the Germans might arrive before the manoeuvre was complete. Deploying to the east would take the force away from Scheer, but Jellicoe's ships might be able to [[crossing the T|cross the &quot;T&quot;]], and visibility would strongly favour British gunnery – Scheer's forces would be silhouetted against the setting sun to the west, while the Grand Fleet would be indistinct against the dark skies to the north and east, and would be hidden by reflection of the low sunlight off intervening haze and smoke. Deployment would take twenty irreplaceable minutes, and the fleets were closing at speed. In one of the most critical and difficult tactical command decisions of the entire war, Jellicoe ordered deployment to the east at 18:15.&lt;ref name=Camp-120/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Castles |last=Massie |pages=612–613}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Windy Corner===
Meanwhile, Hipper had rejoined Scheer, and the combined High Seas Fleet was heading north, directly toward Jellicoe. Scheer had no indication that Jellicoe was at sea, let alone that he was bearing down from the northwest, and was distracted by the intervention of Hood's ships to his north and east. Beatty's four surviving battlecruisers were now crossing the van of the British dreadnoughts to join Hood's three battlecruisers; at this time, Rear-Admiral Arbuthnot's flagship, the armoured cruiser {{HMS|Defence|1907|6}}, and her squadron-mate {{HMS|Warrior|1905|6}} both charged across Beatty's bows, and ''Lion'' narrowly avoided a collision with ''Warrior''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Analysis |last=Campbell |pages=115}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearby, numerous British light cruisers and destroyers on the southwestern flank of the deploying battleships were also crossing each others' courses in attempts to reach their proper stations, often barely escaping collisions, and under fire from some of the approaching German ships. This period of peril and heavy traffic attending the merger and deployment of the British forces later became known as &quot;Windy Corner&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Massie, p. 614&lt;/ref&gt;

Arbuthnot's armoured cruisers had no real place in the coming clash between modern dreadnoughts, but he was attracted by the drifting hull of the crippled ''Wiesbaden''. With ''Warrior'', ''Defence'' closed in for the kill, only to blunder right into the gun sights of Hipper's and Scheer's oncoming capital ships. ''Defence'' was deluged by heavy-calibre gunfire from many German battleships, which detonated her magazines in a spectacular explosion viewed by most of the deploying Grand Fleet; she sank with all hands (903 officers and men). ''Warrior'' was also hit badly, but she was spared destruction by a mishap to the nearby battleship ''Warspite''. ''Warspite'' had her steering gear overheat and jam under heavy load at high speed as the 5th Battle Squadron made a turn to the north at 18:19.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Analysis |last=Campbell |pages=153, p. 179}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steaming at top speed in wide circles, ''Warspite'' appeared as a juicy target to the German dreadnoughts and took 13 hits, inadvertently drawing fire from the hapless ''Warrior''. ''Warspite'' was brought back under control and survived the onslaught, but was badly damaged, had to reduce speed, and withdrew northward; later (at 21:07), she was ordered back to port by Evan-Thomas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Analysis |last=Campbell |pages=259}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Warspite'' went on to a long and illustrious career, serving also in [[World War II]]. ''Warrior'' on the other hand, was abandoned and sank the next day after her crew was taken off at 08:25 on 1 June by ''Engadine'', which towed the sinking armoured cruiser {{convert|100|mi|nmi km|abbr=on}} during the night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Analysis |last=Campbell |pages=319}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As ''Defence'' sank and ''Warspite'' circled, at about 18:19, Hipper moved within range of Rear-Admiral Hood's 3rd Battlecruiser Squadron, but was still also within range of Beatty's ships. At first, visibility favoured the British: {{HMS|Indomitable|1907|6}} hit ''Derfflinger'' three times and ''Seydlitz'' once,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Analysis |last=Campbell |pages=185–187}}&lt;/ref&gt; while ''Lützow'' quickly took 10 hits from ''Lion'', {{HMS|Inflexible|1907|2}} and ''Invincible'', including two below-waterline hits forward by ''Invincible'' that would ultimately doom Hipper's flagship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Analysis |last=Campbell |pages=183}}&lt;/ref&gt; But at 18:30, ''Invincible'' abruptly appeared as a clear target before ''Lützow'' and ''Derfflinger''. The two German ships then fired three salvoes each at ''Invincible'', and sank her in 90 seconds. A {{convert|12|in|mm|abbr=on}} shell from the third salvo struck ''Invincible''{{'}}s Q-turret amidships, flash detonated the magazines below, and the ship blew up and split in two, killing all but six of her crew of 1,032 officers and men, including Rear-Admiral Hood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Analysis |last=Campbell |pages=159}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the remaining British battlecruisers, only ''Princess Royal'' received heavy-calibre hits at this time (two {{convert|12|in|mm|abbr=on}} by the battleship ''Markgraf''). ''Lützow'', flooding forward and unable to communicate by radio, was now out of action and began to attempt to withdraw; therefore Hipper left his flagship and transferred to the destroyer {{SMS|G39||6}}, hoping to board one of the other battlecruisers later.

===Crossing the T===
By 18:30, the main battlefleet action was joined for the first time, with Jellicoe effectively &quot;crossing Scheer's T&quot;. The officers on the lead German battleships, and Scheer himself, were taken completely by surprise when they emerged from drifting clouds of smoky mist to suddenly find themselves facing the massed firepower of the entire Grand Fleet main battle line, which they did not know was even at sea.&lt;ref name=Massie-621&gt;{{cite book |title=Castles |last=Massie |pages=621}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jellicoe's flagship ''Iron Duke'' quickly scored seven hits on the lead German dreadnought, {{SMS|König||6}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Analysis |last=Campbell |pages=187–188}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in this brief exchange, which lasted only minutes, as few as 10 of the Grand Fleet's 24 dreadnoughts actually opened fire. The Germans were hampered by poor visibility, in addition to being in an unfavourable tactical position, just as Jellicoe had intended. Realizing he was heading into a death trap, Scheer ordered his fleet to turn and flee at 18:33. Under a pall of smoke and mist, Scheer's forces succeeded in disengaging by an expertly executed 180° turn in unison (&quot;battle about turn to starboard&quot;), which was a well-practiced emergency manoeuvre of the High Seas Fleet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Castles |last=Massie |pages=622}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote |It was now obvious that we were confronted by a large portion of the English fleet. The entire arc stretching from north to east was a sea of fire. The flash from the muzzles of the guns was seen distinctly through the mist and smoke on the horizon, although the ships themselves were not distinguishable. |Vice-Admiral Reinhard Scheer |&lt;ref name=Massie-621/&gt;}}

Conscious of the risks to his capital ships posed by torpedoes, Jellicoe did not chase directly but headed south, determined to keep the High Seas Fleet west of him. Starting at 18:40, battleships at the rear of Jellicoe's line were in fact sighting and avoiding torpedoes, and at 18:54 {{HMS|Marlborough|1912|6}} was hit by a torpedo (probably from the disabled ''Wiesbaden''), which reduced her speed to {{convert|16|mi|nmi km|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Analysis |last=Campbell |pages=167}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Scheer, knowing that it was not yet dark enough to escape and that his fleet would suffer terribly in a stern chase, doubled back to the east at 18:55. In his memoirs he wrote, &quot;the manœuvre would be bound to surprise the enemy, to upset his plans for the rest of the day, and if the blow fell heavily it would facilitate the breaking loose at night.&quot; But the turn to the east took his ships, again, directly towards Jellicoe's fully-deployed battle line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Castles |last=Massie |pages=624–625}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Simultaneously, the disabled British destroyer ''Shark'' fought desperately against a group of four enemy destroyers and disabled {{SMS|V48||6}} with gunfire, but was finally torpedoed and sunk at 19:02 by the German destroyer ''S54''. ''Shark''{{'}}s [[Loftus William Jones|Captain Loftus Jones]] won the Victoria Cross for his heroism in continuing to fight against all odds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Analysis |last=Campbell |pages=162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''&quot;Gefechtskehrtwendung&quot;''===
Commodore Goodenough's 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron dodged the fire of German battleships for a second time to re-establish contact with the High Seas Fleet shortly after 19:00. By 19:15, Jellicoe had crossed Scheer's &quot;T&quot; again. This time his arc of fire was tighter and deadlier, causing severe damage to the German battleships, particularly Rear-Admiral Behncke's leading 3rd Squadron (SMS ''Konig'', {{SMS|Großer Kurfürst|1913|2}}, ''Markgraf'', and {{SMS|Kaiser|1911|2}} all being hit, along with {{SMS|Helgoland||6}} of the 1st Squadron),&lt;ref name=Camp-246&gt;{{cite book |title=Analysis |last=Campbell |pages=246}}&lt;/ref&gt; while on the British side, only the battlecruiser {{HMS|Colossus|1910|6}} was hit (twice by {{SMS|Seydlitz||6}}, with little damage done).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Analysis |last=Campbell |pages=218}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At 19:17, for the second time in less than an hour, Scheer turned his outnumbered and outgunned fleet to the west using the &quot;battle about turn&quot; (German ''Gefechtskehrtwendung''), but this time it was executed only with difficulty as the High Seas Fleet's lead squadrons began to lose formation under concentrated gunfire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Analysis |last=Campbell |pages=200–201}}&lt;/ref&gt; To deter a British chase, Scheer ordered a major torpedo attack by his destroyers and a potentially sacrificial charge by Scouting Group I's four remaining battlecruisers. Hipper was still aboard the destroyer ''G39'' and was unable to command his squadron for this attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Analysis |last=Campbell |pages=197 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, {{SMS|Derfflinger||6}}, under Captain Hartog, led the already heavily-damaged German battlecruisers directly into &quot;the greatest concentration of naval gunfire any fleet commander had ever faced&quot;, at ranges down to {{convert|4|mi|nmi km|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=Massie-627-8&gt;{{cite book |title=Castles |last=Massie |pages=627–628}}&lt;/ref&gt; In what became known as the &quot;death ride&quot;, all the battlecruisers except {{SMS|Moltke|1910|6}} were hit and further damaged, as 18 of the British battleships fired at them simultaneously.&lt;ref name=Camp-246/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Analysis |last=Campbell |pages=205}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Derfflinger'' had two main gun turrets destroyed, with most of their crews killed, but survived the pounding and veered away with the other battlecruisers once Scheer was out of trouble and the German destroyers were moving in to attack.&lt;ref name=Massie-627-8/&gt; In this brief but intense portion of the engagement, from about 19:05 to about 19:30, the Germans sustained a total of 37 heavy hits while inflicting only two, ''Derfflinger'' alone receiving 14.&lt;ref name=Camp-246/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Analysis |last=Campbell |pages=220}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While his battlecruisers drew the fire of the British fleet, Scheer slipped away, laying smoke screens. Meanwhile, from about 19:16 to about 19:40, the British battleships were also engaging Scheer's destroyers, which executed several waves of torpedo attacks to cover his withdrawal. Jellicoe's ships turned away from the attacks and successfully evaded all 31 of the torpedoes launched at them – though in several cases, only just barely – and sank the German destroyer {{SMS|S35||6}}. British light forces also sank ''V48'', which had previously been disabled by {{HMS|Shark|1912|6}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Analysis |last=Campbell |pages=211–216}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Castles |last=Massie |pages=629–630}}&lt;/ref&gt; This action, and the turn away, cost the British critical time and range in the last hour of daylight, as Scheer intended, allowing him to get his heavy ships out of immediate danger.

The last major exchanges between capital ships in this battle took place just after sunset, from about 20:19 to about 20:35, as the surviving British battlecruisers caught up with their German counterparts, which were briefly relieved by Rear-Admiral Mauve's obsolete pre-dreadnoughts (the German 2nd Squadron).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Analysis |last=Campbell |pages=252–254}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British received one heavy hit on ''Princess Royal'' but scored five more on ''Seydlitz'' and three on other German ships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Analysis |last=Campbell |pages=272}}&lt;/ref&gt; As twilight faded to night and {{HMS|King George V|1911|6}} exchanged a few final shots with {{SMS|Westfalen||6}}, neither side could have imagined that the only encounter between British and German dreadnoughts in the entire war was already concluded.

==Night action and German withdrawal==
{{Main|Night action at the Battle of Jutland}}

At 21:00, Jellicoe, conscious of the Grand Fleet's deficiencies in night-fighting, decided to try to avoid a major engagement until early dawn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Castles |last=Massie |pages=635–636}}&lt;/ref&gt; He placed a screen of cruisers and destroyers {{convert|5|mi|nmi km|abbr=on}} behind his battle fleet to patrol the rear as he headed south to guard Scheer's expected escape route.&lt;ref&gt;Massie, p.637&lt;/ref&gt; In reality, Scheer opted to cross Jellicoe's wake and escape via [[Horns Reef]]. Luckily for Scheer, most of the light forces in Jellicoe's rearguard failed to report the seven separate encounters with the German fleet during the night;&lt;ref name=Massie-645&gt;Massie, p.645&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marder p.140-145&lt;/ref&gt; the very few radio reports that were sent to the British flagship were never received, possibly because the Germans were jamming British frequencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Castles |last=Massie |pages=647}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the destroyers failed to make the most of their opportunities to attack discovered ships, despite Jellicoe's expectations that the destroyer forces would, if necessary, be able to block the path of the German fleet.&lt;ref&gt;Marder p.146&lt;/ref&gt; Jellicoe and his commanders did not understand that the furious gunfire and explosions to the north (seen and heard for hours by all the British battleships) indicated that the German heavy ships were breaking through the screen astern of the British fleet.&lt;ref name=Massie-645/&gt; Instead, it was believed that the fighting was the result of night attacks by German destroyers.&lt;ref&gt;Marder p. 159&lt;/ref&gt; The most powerful British ships of all (the 15-inch-gunned [[British 5th Battle Squadron|5th Battle Squadron]]) directly observed German battleships crossing astern of them in action with British light forces, at ranges of {{convert|3|mi|nmi km|abbr=on}} or less, and gunners on the {{HMS|Malaya||6}} made ready to fire, but her captain declined,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Castles |last=Massie |pages=645–646}}&lt;/ref&gt; deferring to the authority of Rear-Admiral Evan-Thomas – and neither commander reported the sightings to Jellicoe, assuming that he could see for himself and that revealing the fleet's position by radio signals or gunfire was unwise.

While the nature of Scheer's escape, and Jellicoe's inaction, indicate the overall German superiority in night-fighting, the results of the night action were no more clear-cut than were those of the battle as a whole. In the first of many surprise encounters by darkened ships at point-blank range, ''Southampton'', Commodore Goodenough's flagship, which had scouted so proficiently, was heavily damaged in action with a German Scouting Group composed of light cruisers, but managed to torpedo the {{SMS|Frauenlob||6}} which went down at 22:23 with all hands (320 officers and men).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Castles |last=Massie |pages=639–640}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 23:20 to approximately 02:15, several British destroyer [[flotilla]]s launched torpedo attacks on the German battlefleet in a series of violent and chaotic engagements at extremely short range (often under {{convert|.5|mi|nmi km|abbr=on}}).&lt;ref name=Massie-642-647&gt;{{cite book |title=Castles |last=Massie |pages=642–645, pp. 647–648}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the cost of five destroyers sunk and some others damaged, they managed to torpedo the light cruiser {{SMS|Rostock||6}}, which sank several hours later, and the pre-dreadnought {{SMS|Pommern||6}}, which blew up and sank with all hands (839 officers and men) at 03:10 during the last wave of attacks before dawn.&lt;ref name=Massie-642-647/&gt; Three of the British destroyers collided in the chaos, and the German battleship {{SMS|Nassau||6}} rammed the British destroyer {{HMS|Spitfire|1912|6}}, blowing away most of the British ship's superstructure merely with the muzzle blast of its big guns, which could not be aimed low enough to hit the ship. ''Nassau'' was left with a {{convert|11|ft|m|abbr=on}} hole in her side, reducing her maximum speed to {{convert|15|kn|mph km/h|abbr=on}}, while the removed plating was left lying on ''Spitfire''{{'}}s deck.&lt;ref&gt;Marder p. 142&lt;/ref&gt; ''Spitfire'' survived and made it back to port.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Castles |last=Massie |pages=643}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another German cruiser, {{SMS|Elbing||6}}, was accidentally rammed by the dreadnought {{SMS|Posen||2}} and abandoned, sinking early the next day. Of the British destroyers, {{HMS|Tipperary|1915|6}}, {{HMS|Ardent|1913|2}}, {{HMS|Fortune|1913|2}}, {{HMS|Sparrowhawk|1912|2}} and {{HMS|Turbulent|1916|2}} were lost during the night fighting.

Just after midnight on 1 June, {{SMS|Thüringen||6}} and other German battleships sank the {{HMS|Black Prince|1904|6}} of the ill-fated 1st Cruiser Squadron, which had blundered into the German battle line. ''Black Prince'' was overwhelmed by point-blank gunfire, and blew up with all hands (857 officers and men) as her squadron leader ''Defence'' had done hours earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Analysis |last=Campbell |pages=290}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lost in the darkness, the battlecruisers {{SMS|Moltke|1910|6}} and {{SMS|Seydlitz||2}} had similar point-blank encounters with the British battle line and were recognized, but were spared the fate of ''Black Prince'' when the captains of the British ships, again, declined to open fire, reluctant to reveal their fleet's position.&lt;ref name=Massie-651&gt;{{cite book |title=Castles |last=Massie |pages=651–652}}&lt;/ref&gt; At 01:45, the sinking battlecruiser ''Lützow'' – fatally damaged by ''Invincible'' during the main action – was torpedoed by the destroyer {{SMS|G38||6}} on orders of ''Lützow''{{'}}s Captain Viktor von Harder after the surviving crew of 1,150 transferred to destroyers that came alongside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Castles |last=Massie |pages=650–651}}&lt;/ref&gt; At 02:15, the German destroyer {{SMS|V4||6}} suddenly had its bow blown off; ''V2'' and ''V6'' came alongside and took off the remaining crew and the ''V2'' then sank the hulk. Since there was no enemy nearby, it was assumed that she had hit a mine or a had been torpedoed by a submarine.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=German Perspective |last=Tarrant |pages=245}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At 02:15, five British ships of the 13th Destroyer Flotilla under Captain James Uchtred Farie regrouped and headed south. At 02:25, they sighted the rear of the German line. [[Marksman class destroyer|HMS ''Marksman'']] inquired of the leader {{HMS|Champion|1915|2}} as to whether he thought they were British or German ships. Answering that he thought they were German, Farie then veered off to the east and away from the German line. All but ''Moresby'' in the rear followed, as through the gloom she sighted what she thought were four pre-dreadnought battleships {{convert|2|mi|nmi km|abbr=on}} away. She hoisted a flag signal indicating that the enemy was to the west and then closed to firing range, letting off a torpedo set for high-running at 02:37 then veering off to rejoin her flotilla. The four pre-dreadnought battleships were in fact two pre-dreadnoughts, ''Schleswig-Holstein'' and ''Schlesien'', and the battlecruisers ''Von der Tann'' and ''Derfflinger''. ''Von der Tann'' sighted the torpedo and was forced to steer hard a starboard to avoid it as it passed close to her bows. ''Moresby'' rejoined ''Champion'' convinced she had scored a hit.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt;

Finally, at 05:20, as Scheer's fleet was safely on its way home, the battleship {{SMS|Ostfriesland||6}} struck a British mine on her starboard side, killing one man and wounding ten, but was able to make port.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=German Perspective |last=Tarrant |pages=259 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Seydlitz'', critically damaged and very nearly sinking, barely survived the return voyage and after grounding and taking on even more water in the evening of 1 June, had to be assisted in to port stern first, where she dropped anchor at 07:30 on the morning of 2 June.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=German Perspective |pages=260–261}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Germans were helped in their escape by the failure of the British admiralty in London to pass on seven critical radio intercepts obtained by naval intelligence indicating the true position, course and intentions of the High Seas Fleet during the night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Castles |last=Massie |pages=6342}}&lt;/ref&gt; One message was transmitted to Jellicoe at 23:15 that accurately reported the German fleets course and speed as of 21:14. However, the erroneous signal from earlier in the day that reported the German fleet still in port, and an intelligence signal received at 22:45 giving another unlikely position for the German fleet, had reduced his confidence in intelligence reports. Had the other messages been forwarded, which confirmed the information received at 23:15, or had British ships reported accurately sightings and engagements with German destroyers, cruisers and battleships, then Jellicoe could have altered course to intercept Scheer at the Horns Reef. The unsent intercepted messages had been duly filed by the junior officer left on duty that night, who failed to appreciate their significance.&lt;ref&gt;Marder p.148-151&lt;/ref&gt; By the time Jellicoe finally learned of Scheer's whereabouts at 04:15, Scheer was too far away to catch and it was clear that the battle could no longer be resumed.

==The outcome==
===Reporting===
On 3 June, the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' reported the German Director of the Naval Department had told the ''Reichstag'': &quot;The result of the fighting is a significant success for our forces against a much stronger adversary&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBCMirror&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/worldwars/wwone/mirror03_06.shtml |title=Daily Mirror Headlines: The Battle of Jutland, Published 3&amp;nbsp;June&amp;nbsp;1916 |work=BBC  – History}}&lt;/ref&gt; as part of their communique to the press, the British Admiralty had said &quot;...The British ships on which the brunt of the fighting fell were the battlecruiser fleet and some cruisers and light cruisers, supported by four fast battleships. Among these the losses were heavy.&quot;&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBCMirror&quot;/&gt;

===Assessments===
[[Image:SMS Seydlitz damage.jpg|thumb|SMS ''Seydlitz'' was heavily damaged in the battle, hit by twenty-one main calibre shells, several secondary calibre and one torpedo. 98 men were killed and 55 injured]]
[[Image:Marynarz Wilhelmshaven SMS Westfalen.jpg|thumb|upright|A crew member of SMS ''Westfalen'']]

At Jutland, the Germans, with a 99-strong fleet, sank {{convert|115000|LT|t|lk=on|abbr=on}} of British ships, while a 151-strong British fleet sank {{convert|62000|LT|t|abbr=on}} of German ships. The British lost 6,094 seamen; the Germans 2,551. Several other ships were badly damaged, such as {{HMS|Lion|1910|2}} and {{SMS|Seydlitz||2}}. On the other hand, the British fleet remained in control of the North Sea at the end of the battle.

At a strategic level, the outcome has been the subject of a huge literature, with no clear consensus. In the immediate aftermath, the view of the battle as indecisive was widely held, and remains influential.

Despite numerical superiority, the British had been disappointed in their hopes for a decisive victory comparable to [[Trafalgar]] and the objective of the influential strategic doctrines of [[Alfred Mahan]]. The High Seas Fleet survived as a [[fleet in being]]. Most of its losses were made good within a month – even ''Seydlitz'', the most badly damaged ship to survive the battle, was repaired by October and officially back in service by November. The Germans had failed in their objective of destroying a substantial portion of the British Fleet. No progress had been made towards the goal of allowing the High Seas Fleet to operate in the Atlantic Ocean.

Subsequently there has been considerable support for the view of Jutland as a strategic victory for the British. While the British had not destroyed the German fleet and had lost more ships than their enemy, the Germans had retreated to harbour and at the end of the battle the British were in command of the area. The German fleet would only sortie into the North Sea twice more, with a [[Action of 19 August 1916|raid on 19 August]] and in October 1916. Apart from these two (abortive) operations the High Seas Fleet – unwilling to risk another encounter with the British fleet – confined its actvities to the Baltic sea for the remainder of the war. Jutland thus ended the German challenge to British naval supremacy. A German naval expert, writing publicly about Jutland in November 1918 commented, &quot;Our Fleet losses were severe. On 1 June 1916 it was clear to every thinking person that this battle must, and would be, the last one&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Marder III p.206 citing Captain Persius, [[Berliner Tageblatt]], 18 November 1918&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the battle, the British had maintained their numerical superiority and had 23 dreadnoughts ready and four battlecruisers still able to fight, while the Germans had 10.&lt;ref name=Massie-665&gt;{{cite book |title=Castles |last=Massie |pages=665}}&lt;/ref&gt; The damaged dreadnoughts ''Warspite'' and ''Malaya'' went in for repairs, ''Queen Elizabeth'' and ''Emperor of India'' joined the fleet and ''Resolution'' and ''Ramillies'' shortly after that. ''Princess Royal'' and ''Tiger'' in dockyard were replaced by ''Australia''. One month after the battle, the Grand Fleet was stronger than it had been before sailing to Jutland.&lt;ref name=Massie-665/&gt; 

A third view, presented in a number of recent evaluations is that Jutland, the last major fleet action between battleships, illustrated the irrelevance of battleship fleets following the development of the submarine, mine and torpedo.&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn0-14-101155-6&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Kennedy |title=The Rise and Fall |pages=257}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this view, the most important consequence of Jutland was the decision of the Germans to engage in unrestricted submarine warfare. Although large numbers of battleships were constructed in the decades between the wars, it has been argued that this outcome reflected the social dominance, among naval decision-makers, of battleship advocates who constrained technological choices to fit traditional paradigms of fleet action.&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn0-8018-6486-0&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=McBride, William Leon |title=Technological change and the United States Navy, 1865–1945 |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |location=Baltimore |year=2000 |isbn=0-8018-6486-0 |oclc= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the event &lt;!-- Do not alter this line, it is correct for British English. --&gt;, battleships played a relatively minor role in World War II, in which the aircraft carrier emerged as the dominant offensive weapon of naval warfare.&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn1-57488-663-0&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Polmar, Norman |title=Aircraft Carriers: A History of Carrier Aviation and Its Influence on World Events, Volume 1: 1909–1945 |publisher=Potomac Books |location=Washington |year=2006 |isbn=1-57488-663-0 |oclc= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===British self critique===
The official British Admiralty examination of the Grand Fleet's performance recognised two main problems:
*Their armour-piercing shells exploded outside the German armour rather than penetrating and exploding within. As a result, some German ships with only {{convert|8|in|cm|abbr=on}}-thick armour survived hits from 15-inch (381&amp;nbsp;mm) shells. Had these shells penetrated through the armour and then exploded, German losses would probably have been far greater.
*Communication between ships and the British commander-in-chief were comparatively poor. For most of the battle, Jellicoe had no idea where the German ships were, even though British ships were in contact. They failed to report enemy positions, contrary to the Grand Fleet's Battle Plan. Some of the most important signalling was carried out solely by flag instead of wireless or using redundant methods to ensure communications— a questionable procedure given the mixture of haze and smoke that obscured the battlefield, and a foreshadowing of similar failures by habit-bound and conservatively-minded professional officers of rank to take advantage of new technology in World War II.&lt;!--This paragraph is nonsense. What Admiralty examination refers to communications? What instances of &quot;important signalling being carried solely by flag&quot; are there, other than those notably perpetrated by Beatty's Flag Lieutenant? Unless anyone has something in defence of this, it's going in a week. ~~~~---&gt;

====Shell performance====
German [[Armour-piercing shot and shell|armour-piercing shells]] were far more effective than the British shells, which often failed to penetrate heavy armour.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, pp. 386–387&lt;/ref&gt; The issue particularly concerned shells striking at oblique angles, which became increasingly the case at long range.&lt;ref&gt;Marder III p.170&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue of poorly performing shells had been known to Jellicoe, who as third sea lord from 1908–1910 had ordered new shells to be designed. However, the matter had not been followed through after his posting to sea and new shells had never been thoroughly tested.&lt;ref&gt;'Castles' p.61.&lt;/ref&gt; Beatty discovered the problem at a party aboard ''Lion'' a short time after the battle, where a Swedish Naval officer was present. He had recently visited Berlin, where the German navy had scoffed at how British shells had broken up on their ships' armour.&lt;ref name=Castles668&gt;'Castles' p. 668&lt;/ref&gt; The question of shell effectiveness had also been raised after the [[Battle of Dogger Bank]], but no action had been taken.&lt;ref&gt;Marder III p.171&lt;/ref&gt; Hipper later commented, 'it was nothing but the poor quality of their bursting charges which saved us from disaster'.&lt;ref&gt;'Castles' p. 671 citing Marder Vol. III p.81&lt;/ref&gt;

Admiral Dreyer, writing later about the battle where he had been captain of the flagship, ''Iron Duke'', estimated that effective shells as later introduced would have led to the sinking of six more German capital ships, based upon the actual number of hits achieved in the battle.&lt;ref&gt;Marder p. 169&lt;/ref&gt; The system of testing shells, which remained in use up to 1944, meant that, statistically, a batch of shells of which 70% were faulty stood an even chance of being accepted. Indeed, even shells that failed this relatively mild test had still been issued to ships. Analysis of the test results afterwards by the ordnance board suggested the likelihood that 30–70% of shells would not have passed the standard penetration test specified by the admiralty.&lt;ref&gt;Marder III p. 171&lt;/ref&gt;

Efforts to replace the shells were initially resisted by the admiralty and action was not taken until Jellicoe became first sea lord in December 1916. As an initial response the worst of the existing shells were withdrawn from ships in early 1917 and replaced from reserve supplies.&lt;ref&gt;Marder III, p.215&lt;/ref&gt; New shells were designed, but did not arrive until April 1918, and were never used in action.&lt;ref name=Castles668/&gt;

====Battlecruiser losses====
The British battlecruisers were designed to chase and destroy enemy cruisers from a range at which cruisers could not reply. They were not designed to be [[ship of the line|ships of the line]] and exchange [[broadside]]s with the enemy. Although one German and three British battlecruisers were sunk, none of them were destroyed by enemy shells penetrating the belt armour and detonating the magazines. Each of the British battlecruisers were penetrated through a turret roof and her magazines ignited by flash fires passing through the turret and shell handling rooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Castles |last=Massie |pages=666–667}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Lützow'' sustained 24 hits and her flooding could not be contained. She was eventually sunk by her escorts' torpedoes after her crew had been safely removed. ''Derfflinger'' and ''Seydlitz'' sustained 22 hits each but made it to port (though ''Seydlitz'' just barely).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Castles |last=Massie |pages=666}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The disturbing feature of the battlecruiser action is the fact that five German battlecruisers engaging six British vessels of this class, supported after the first twenty minutes, although at great range, by the fire of four battleships of the &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; class, were yet able to sink 'Queen Mary' and 'Indefatigable' … The facts which contributed to the British losses, first, were the indifferent armour protection of our battlecruisers, particularly as regards turret armour, and, second, deck plating and the disadvantage under which our vessels laboured in regard to the light.|Sir John Jellicoe|''Jellicoe's official despatch''}}

An impression was given by Jellicoe and Beatty, as well as other senior officers that the loss of the Battlecruisers was caused by weak armour, despite reports by two committees, and earlier statements by Jellicoe and other senior officers that Cordite and its management were to blame. This led to calls for armour to be increased and an additional {{convert|1|in|cm|abbr=on}} was placed over the relatively thin decks above magazines. To compensate for the increase in weight, ships had to carry correspondingly less fuel, water and other supplies. Whether or not thin deck armour was a potential weakness of British ships, the battle provided no evidence that it was the case. At least amongst the surviving ships, no enemy shell was found to have penetrated deck armour anywhere.&lt;ref&gt;Marder III p.218&lt;/ref&gt; The design of a new battlecruiser {{HMS|Hood|1918|6}} (which had started building at the time of the battle) was altered to give her {{convert|5000|LT|t|abbr=on}} of additional armour.&lt;ref&gt;Marder III p. 219&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ammunition handling====
British and German [[propellant]] charges differed in packaging, handling, and chemistry. The British propellant was of two types, MK1 and MD. The Mark 1 cordite had a formula 37% nitrocellulose, 58% nitroglycerine and 5% petroleum jelly. It was a good propellant but burned hot and caused an erosion problem in gun barrels. The petroleum jelly served as both a lubricant and a stabilizer. Cordite MD was developed to reduce barrel wear its formula being 65% nitrocellulose, 30% nitroglycerine and 5% petroleum jelly. While cordite MD solved the gun barrel erosion issue, it did nothing to improve its storage properties which were poor. Cordite was very sensitive to variations of temperature and acid propagation/cordite deterioration would take place at a very rapid rate. Cordite MD also had a property that it would shed micro-dust particles of nitrocellulose and iron pyrite.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.navweaps.com/index_tech/tech-100.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  While cordite propellant was manageable it required a vigilant gunnery officer, strict cordite lot control, and frequent testing of the cordite lots in the ships' magazines.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldwar1.co.uk/grant.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

British [[cordite]] propellant (handled in exposed silk bags) tended to burn violently, causing uncontrollable &quot;flash fires&quot; when ignited by nearby shell hits. In 1945, a test was conducted by the U.S.N. Bureau of Ordnance Bulletin of Ordnance Information, No.245, pp.&amp;nbsp;54–60.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.warship.org/loss_of_hms_hood__part_3.htm#68&lt;/ref&gt; testing the sensitivity of Cordite to then current U.S. Naval propellant powders against a measurable and repeatable flash source finding that the result was that cordite would ignite at 530&amp;nbsp;mm/22&quot; from the flash and the current U.S. powder at 120&amp;nbsp;mm,/5&quot; the U.S. flashless powder at 25&amp;nbsp;mm./1&quot; The result was that about 75 times the propellant would immediately ignite exposed to flash as compared to the U.S. powder. British ships had inadequate protection against these flash fires. German propellant (''RP C/12'', handled in brass cartridge cases) was less vulnerable and less volatile in composition.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, pp. 377–378&lt;/ref&gt;  German propellants show that they were not that different in composition from cordite with one major exception. Centralite was symmetrical Diethyl Diphenyl Urea and served as a stabilizer that was superior to the petroleum jelly used in British practice. It stored better and burned but did not explode. stored and used in brass cases it proved much less sensitive to flash. RP C/12 – 64.13% nitrocellulose, 29.77% nitroglycerine, 5.75% centralite, 0.25% magnesium oxide and 0.10% graphite.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.navweaps.com/index_tech/tech-100.htm&lt;/ref&gt;   

The Royal Navy Battle Cruiser Fleet had also emphasized speed in ammunition handling over established safety protocol. By staging charges in the chambers between the gun turret and magazine, the Royal Navy enhanced their rate of fire but left their ships vulnerable to chain reaction ammunition fires and magazine explosions.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, pp. 371–372&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldwar1.co.uk/grant.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  The British cordite charges were stored two silk bags to a metal cylindrical container with a 16-oz gunpowder igniter charge which was covered with a thick paper wad, some four charges being used on each projectile. The gun crews were removing the charges from their containers and removing the paper covering over the gunpowder igniter charges. The effect of having eight loads at the ready was to have {{convert|4|ST|kg|abbr=on}} of exposed explosive and each charge leaking small amounts of gunpowder from the igniter bags. The gun crews and therefor packed the turret to the magazines with an explosive train and one shell hit to a battlecruiser turret was enough to end a ship.&lt;ref&gt;British Battlecruisers 1914–18, Lawrence Burr, Tony Bryan p.41-42&lt;/ref&gt; 


During the summer of 2003, a diving expedition examined the wrecks of ''Invincible'', ''Queen Mary'', ''Defence'', and ''Lützow'' to investigate the cause of the British ships' tendency to suffer from internal explosions. From this evidence, a major part of the blame may be laid on lax handling of the cordite propellant for the shells of the main guns. This, in turn, was a product of contemporary British naval doctrine, which emphasized a rapid rate of fire. The wreck of the ''Queen Mary'' reveals that the working chamber of the X turret stacked with cordite containers instead of the magazine.&lt;ref&gt;British Battlecruisers 1914–18, Lawrence Burr, Tony Bryan p.43&lt;/ref&gt;

In practice-drills that emphasized firing speed, cordite could not be supplied to the guns rapidly enough through the hoists and hatches. To bring up the propellant in good time to load for the next broadside, many safety doors were kept open that should have been shut to safeguard against flash fires. Bags of cordite were also stocked and kept locally, creating a total breakdown of safety design features. This 'bad safety habit' carried over into real battle practices.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldwar1.co.uk/grant.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, the doctrine of a high rate of fire also led to the decision in 1913 to increase the supply of shells and cordite held on the British ships by 50%, for fear of running out of ammunition. When this exceeded the capacity of the ships' magazines, cordite was stored in insecure places.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lambert |title=Bloody Ships |pages=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was a further difference in the propellant itself. While ''RP C/12'' burned when exposed to fire, it did not explode, as opposed to cordite. ''RP C/12'' was extensively studied by the British and, after World War I, would form the basis of the later Cordite SC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNGER_projectiles.htm |title=German Ammunition, Guns and Mountings Definitions |accessdate=19 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The memoirs of Alexander Grant, Gunner on ''Lion'', suggest that some British officers were aware of the dangers of careless handling of cordite:

{{quote|&quot;With the introduction of cordite to replace powder for firing guns, regulations regarding the necessary precautions for handling explosives became unconsciously considerably relaxed, even I regret to say, to a dangerous degree throughout the Service. The gradual lapse in the regulations on board ship seemed to be due to two factors. First, cordite is a much safer explosive to handle than gun-powder. Second, but more important, the altered construction of the magazines on board led to a feeling of false security … The iron or steel deck, the disappearance of the wood lining, the electric lights fitted inside, the steel doors, open because there was now no chute for passing cartridges out; all this gave officers and men a comparative easiness of mind regarding the precautions necessary with explosive material&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldwar1.co.uk/grant.htm Memoir of Gunnery Officer Alexander Grant]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Grant had already introduced measures onboard ''Lion'' to limit the number of cartridges kept outside the magazine and to ensure doors were kept closed, probably contributing to her survival.&lt;ref&gt;marder III p.174&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 June 1916, the First Lord of the Admiralty advised Cabinet Members that the three Battle-cruisers had been lost due to unsafe cordite management.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lawrence Burr p.40&quot;&gt;British Battlecruisers 1914–18, Lawrence Burr, Tony Bryan p.40&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 November 1916, the Third Sea Lord, Rear Admiral Tudor, issued a report after detailed interviews of the survivors of the destroyed Battle-Cruisers detailing the stacking of charges by the gun crews in the handling rooms to speed up loading of the guns.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lawrence Burr p.40&quot;/&gt;

After the battle, the B.C.F Gunnery Committee issued a report (at the command of Admiral David Beatty) advocating immediate changes in flash protection and change handling reporting that among other things:
*Some vent plates in magazines allowed flash into the magazines and should be retro-fitted to a new standard.

The United States Navy in 1939 had quantities of Cordite N (a much improved Canadian propellant) and its [[Bureau of Ordnance]] objected strongly to its use on-board U.S. Warships considering it unsuitable as a naval propellant due to its inclusion of nitroglycerin.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.navweaps.com/index_tech/tech-100.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gunnery====
British gunnery control systems, based on [[Frederic Charles Dreyer|Dreyer tables]] were well in advance of the German ones, as demonstrated by the proportion of main calibre hits under manœuvre and were fitted to the majority of British capital ships by May, 1916.&lt;ref&gt;Brooks p.224&lt;/ref&gt; The Royal Navy used centralised [[fire control system]]s on their capital ships, directed from a point high up on the ship where fall of shells could best be seen, utilising a director sight for both training and elevating the guns. This had been installed on ships progressively as the war went on because of its demonstrated advantages, and was installed on the main guns of all but two of the Grand Fleet's capital ships. The German battlecruisers controlled the fire of turrets using a training-only director, which also did not fire the guns at once. The rest of the German capital ships were without this innovation. German range finding equipment was generally superior to the British {{convert|9|ft|m|1|abbr=on}} FT24, as its operators were trained to a higher standard due to the complexity of the Zeiss {{convert|3|m|ft|abbr=on}} rangefinders. Their [[Stereoscopic rangefinder|stereoscopic]] design meant that in certain conditions they could range on a target enshrouded by smoke.&lt;ref&gt;Brooks, pp. 221–222&lt;/ref&gt; The German equipment was not superior in range to the British [[Barr &amp; Stroud]] {{convert|15|ft|m|abbr=on}} rangefinder found in the newest British capital ships, and unlike the British rangefinders, the German rangetakers had to be replaced as often as every thirty minutes as their eyesight became impaired, affecting the ranges provided to their gunnery equipment.&lt;ref&gt;Brooks, p. 223&lt;/ref&gt;

The results of the battle confirmed the value of centralised director firing of guns. The Royal Navy was prompted to install director firing systems to cruisers and destroyers where it had not thus far been used, and to secondary armament on battleships.&lt;ref&gt;Marder III p.213-214&lt;/ref&gt;

German ships were perceived to have been quicker in determining the correct range and thus obtained an early advantage. The British used a 'bracket system', whereby a salvo was fired at the best guess range and depending where it landed the range was progressively corrected up or down until successive shots were landing in front of and behind the enemy. The Germans used a 'ladder system' whereby an initial volley of three shots at different ranges was used, with the centre shot at the best guess range. The ladder system allowed the gunners to get ranging information from the three shots more quickly than the bracket system, which required waiting between shots to see how the last had landed. British ships adopted the German system.&lt;ref&gt;Marder III p.166, 214&lt;/ref&gt;

It was determined that {{convert|41|ft|6|in|m|abbr=on}}9-foot (2.7 m) rangefinders of the sort issued to most British ships were not adequate at long range and did not perform as well as the 15-foot (4.5 m) rangefinders on some of the most modern ships. In 1917, rangefinders of base lengths of {{convert|25|ft|m|1|abbr=on}} and {{convert|30|ft|m|1|abbr=on}} were introduced on the battleships to improve accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;Marder p. 215&lt;/ref&gt;

====Signalling====
Throughout the battle, British ships experienced difficulties with communications, whereas the Germans did not suffer such problems. The British preferred signalling by ship to ship flag and lamp signals, avoiding wireless, whereas the Germans used wireless successfully. One conclusion drawn was that flag signals were not a satisfactory way to control the fleet. Experience using lamps, particularly at night when issuing challenges to other ships, demonstrated this was an excellent way to advertise your precise location to an enemy, inviting a reply by gunfire. Recognition signals by lamp once seen could also easily be copied in future engagements.&lt;ref&gt;Marder III p.175-176&lt;/ref&gt;

British ships both failed to report engagements with the enemy, but also in the case of cruisers and destroyers failed to actively seek out the enemy. A culture had arisen within the fleet of not acting without orders, which could prove fatal when any circumstances prevented orders being sent or received. Commanders failed to engage the enemy because they believed other more senior officers must also be aware of the enemy nearby, and would have given orders to act if this was expected. Wireless, the most direct way to pass messages across the fleet (although it was being jammed by German ships) was avoided either for perceived reasons of not giving away the presence of ships, or for fear of cluttering up the airwaves with unnecessary reports.&lt;ref&gt;Marder III p.176-178&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fleet Standing Orders====
Naval operations were governed by standing orders issued to all the ships. These attempted to set out what ships should do in all circumstances, particularly in situations where ships would have to react without referring to higher authority, or when communications failed. A number of changes were introduced as a result of experience gained in the battle.

A new signal was introduced instructing squadron commanders to act independently as they thought best while still supporting the main fleet, particularly for use when circumstances would make it difficult to send detailed orders. The description stressed that this was not intended to be the only time commanders might take independent action, but was intended to make plain times when they definitely should. Similarly, instructions on what to do if the fleet was instructed to take evasive action against torpedoes were amended. Commanders were given discretion that if their part of the fleet was not under immediate attack, they should continue engaging the enemy rather than turning away with the rest of the fleet. In this battle, when the fleet turned away from Scheer's destroyer attack covering his retreat, not all the British ships had been affected, and could have continued to engage the enemy more closely.&lt;ref&gt;MarderIII p.222&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of opportunities to attack enemy ship by torpedo had presented themselves but been missed. All ships, not just the destroyers armed principally with torpedoes but also battleships, were reminded that they carried torpedoes intended to be used whenever an opportunity arose. Destroyers were instructed to close the enemy fleet to fire torpedoes as soon as engagements between the main ships on either side would keep enemy guns busy directed at larger targets. Destroyers should also be ready to immediately engage enemy destroyers if they should launch an attack, endeavouring to disrupt their chances of launching torpedoes and keep them away from the main fleet.&lt;ref&gt;Marder III p.224-225&lt;/ref&gt;

A new signal was provided for deploying the fleet to the centre, rather than as previously only either to left or right of the standard closed-up formation for travelling, to add some flexibility when deploying for attack. The fast and powerful 5th Battle Squadron was moved to the front of the cruising formation so it would have the option of deploying left or right depending upon the enemy position. In the event of engagements at night, although the fleet still preferred to avoid night fighting, a destroyer and cruiser squadron would be specifically detailed to seek out the enemy and launch destroyer attacks.&lt;ref&gt;Marder III p.226&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
At the time, Jellicoe was criticised for his caution and for allowing Scheer to escape.&lt;ref name=Massie-631&gt;Massie, p. 631&lt;/ref&gt; Beatty, in particular, was convinced that Jellicoe had missed a tremendous opportunity to annihilate the High Seas Fleet&lt;ref&gt;Massie, p. 670&lt;/ref&gt; and win what would amount to another [[battle of Trafalgar|Trafalgar]]. Jellicoe was promoted away from active command to become First Sea Lord, the professional head of the Royal Navy, while Beatty replaced him as commander of the Grand Fleet.

The controversy raged within the navy and in public for about a decade after the war. Criticism focused on Jellicoe's decision at 19:15. Scheer had ordered his cruisers and destroyers forward in a torpedo attack to cover the turning away of his battleships. Jellicoe chose to turn to the southeast, and so keep out of range of the torpedoes. If, instead, he had turned to the west, could his ships have dodged the torpedoes and destroyed the German fleet?&lt;ref name=Massie-631/&gt; Supporters of Jellicoe, including the historian [[Cyril Falls]], pointed to the folly of risking defeat in battle when you already have [[command of the sea]].&lt;ref name=Massie-675&gt;{{cite book |title=Castles |last=Massie |pages=675}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jellicoe himself, in a letter to the Admiralty months before the battle, had stated that he intended to turn his fleet away from any mass torpedo attack (that being the universally accepted proper tactical response to such attacks, practiced by all the major navies of the world&lt;ref name=Massie-675/&gt;), and that in the event of a fleet engagement in which the enemy turned away he would assume that the intention was to draw him over mines or submarines and that he would decline to be so drawn. The Admiralty approved this plan and expressed full confidence in Jellicoe at the time (Oct. 1914).&lt;ref&gt;Massie, p. 632&lt;/ref&gt;

The stakes were high, the pressure on Jellicoe immense, and his caution certainly understandable. His judgment might have been that even 90% odds in favour were not good enough to bet the British Empire. The former [[First Lord of the Admiralty]] [[Winston Churchill]] said of the battle that Jellicoe &quot;was the only man on either side who could have lost the war in an afternoon.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Castles |last=Massie |page=681}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The criticism of Jellicoe also fails to sufficiently credit Scheer, who was determined to preserve his fleet by avoiding the full British battle line, and who showed great skill in effecting his escape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Castles |last=Massie |page=672}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Beatty's actions===
On the other hand, some of Jellicoe's supporters condemned the actions of Beatty for the British failure to achieve a complete victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Castles |last=Massie |pages=670, 679}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Beatty was undeniably brave, his mismanagement of the initial encounter with Hipper's squadron and the High Seas Fleet cost considerable advantage in the first hours of the battle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Castles |last=Massie |pages=673–674}}&lt;/ref&gt; His most glaring failure was in not providing Jellicoe with periodic information on the position, course and speed of the High Seas Fleet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Castles |last=Massie |pages=674}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beatty, aboard the battlecruiser ''Lion'', left behind the four fast battleships of the 5th Battle Squadron – the most powerful warships in the world at the time – engaging with six ships when better control would have given him 10 against Hipper's five. Though Beatty's larger {{convert|13.5|in|mm|abbr=on}} guns outranged Hipper's {{convert|11|in|mm|abbr=on}} and {{convert|12|in|mm|abbr=on}} guns by thousands of yards, Beatty held his fire for 10 minutes and closed the enemy squadron until within range of the Germans' superior gunnery, under lighting conditions that favoured the Germans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Castles |last=Massie |pages=589–590}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the British losses in tonnage occurred in Beatty's force.

==Status of the survivors and wrecks==
On the 90th anniversary of the battle, in 2006, the Ministry of Defence announced that the 14 British vessels lost in the battle were being designated as ''protected places'' under the [[Protection of Military Remains Act]]. The last surviving veteran of the battle, [[Henry Allingham]], a British [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] (originally [[Royal Naval Air Service|RNAS]]) airman, died on 18 July 2009 aged 113; by which time he was the oldest documented man in the world and one of the last surviving veterans of the whole war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/5098174.stm |title=Britain's oldest veteran recalls WWI |accessdate=19 May 2008 |work=BBC News   | date=26 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One ship survives and is still in commission as a [[Royal Naval Reserve]] depot in [[Belfast]], [[Northern Ireland]]: the [[light cruiser]] [[HMS Caroline (1914)|HMS ''Caroline'']].

==Remembrance==
The Battle of Jutland was annually celebrated as a great victory by the right wing in Weimar Germany. This &quot;victory&quot; was used to repress the memory of the dreadful role of the German navy in the [[German Revolution of 1918–19]] as well as the memory of the defeat in World War I in general. (The celebrations of the [[Battle of Tannenberg]] played a similar role in the [[Weimar Republic]].) This is especially true for the city of [[Wilhelmshaven]], where wreath-laying ceremonies and torch-lit parades were performed until the end of the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Götz: Remembering the Battle, p. 360&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bambara''', more correctly known as '''Bamanankan (ߓߡߊߣߊ߲ߞߊ߲)''', its designation in the language itself (literally 'Bamana(n) sound'), is a [[language]] spoken in [[Mali]] by as many as six million people (including second language users). The Bambara language is the mother tongue of the [[Bambara ethnic group]], numbering about 4,000,000 people, but serves also as a [[lingua franca]] in Mali (it is estimated that about 80% of the population speaks it as a first or second language). It is an [[Subject Object Verb|SOV]] language and has two [[tone (tonal language)|tone]]s.

==Classification==
Bambara belongs to a group of closely-related languages called [[Manding languages|Manding]], within the larger [[Mande languages|Mandé]] group. It is closely related to [[Dioula language|Dioula]] (or Jula), a language spoken or understood by fewer people in [[Burkina Faso]], [[Côte d'Ivoire]] and [[The Gambia]].

==Orthography and literature==
It uses seven vowels a, e, {{IPA|ɛ}}, i, o, {{IPA|ɔ}} and u (the letters approximate their [[help:IPA|IPA]] equivalents).
Writing was introduced during the [[French colonial empire|French]] occupation and literacy is limited, especially in rural areas. Although written literature is only slowly evolving (due to the predominance of French as the &quot;language of the educated&quot;), there exists a wealth of [[oral history|oral literature]], which is often tales of kings and heroes. This oral literature is mainly tradited by the &quot;[[Griot]]s&quot; (''Jɛliw'' in Bambara) who are a mixture of [[storytelling|storyteller]]s, [[praise singer]]s and human history books who have studied the trade of singing and reciting for many years. Many of their songs are very old and are said to date back to the old kingdom of Mali.

==Geographical distribution==
Bambara is a national language of Mali, and also the most widely understood language in Mali.

==Dialects==
The main dialect is standard Bamara, which has significant influence from [[Western Maninkakan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;eth&quot; /&gt; Bambara has many local dialects. Some dialect variants: Somono, Segou, San, Beledugu, Ganadugu, Wasulu and Sikasso.&lt;ref name=&quot;eth&quot; /&gt;

[[Dioula language|Jula]] is a dialect in the [[Manding languages|Manding linguistic continuum]] and is closely related to Bambara. It is a widely-used trade language in [[West Africa]].

==Writing==
Since the 1970s Bambara has mostly been written in the Latin alphabet, using some additional phonetic characters. The vowels are ''a, e, {{unicode|ɛ}}'' (formerly ''è''), ''i, o, {{unicode|ɔ}}'' (formerly ''ò''), ''u''; accents can be used to indicate tonality. The former digraph ''ny'' is now written ''{{unicode|ɲ}}'' or ''ñ'' (Senegal). The ambiguous digraph &quot;ng&quot; represented both the {{IPA|[ŋɡ]}} sound of English &quot;fi''ng''er&quot; and the {{IPA|[ŋ]}} of &quot;si''ng''er&quot;. The 1966 Bamako spelling conventions render the latter sound as &quot;ŋ&quot;.

The [[N'Ko]] (ߒ'ߞߏ) alphabet is a script devised by [[Solomana Kante]] in 1949 as a writing system for the Mande languages of West Africa; N’Ko means 'I say' in all Mande languages. Kante created N’Ko in response to what he felt were beliefs that Africans were a &quot;cultureless people&quot; since prior to this time there had been no indigenous African writing system for his language. N'ko came first into use in Kankan, Guinea as a Maninka alphabet and disseminated from there into other Mande-speaking parts of West Africa. N'ko and the [[Arabic script]] are still in use for Bambara, although the Latin alphabet is much more common.
&lt;!--
There are some or just one? [[User:Guaka|G-u-a-k-@]] hasn't found any yet, after nearly 3 months in Bamako.. :(  newspapers in Bambara. --&gt;

==Grammar==
Bambara belongs to a group of closely-related languages called Manding (related to [[Mandinka language|Mandinka]], [[Mande]] language group). It is an [[Subject Object Verb|SOV]] language and has two (mid/standard and high) [[tone (tonal language)|tone]]s; e.g. ''sa'' 'death' vs. ''sá'' 'snake.' The typical argument structure of the language consists of a subject, followed by an aspectival auxiliary, followed by the direct object, and finally a transitive verb.  Naturally, if the verb is intransitive, the direct object is not found.

Bambara does not inflect for gender. Gender for a noun can be specified by adding a suffix, ''-ce'' or ''-ke'' for male and ''-muso'' for female. The plural is formed by attaching ''-w'' to words.

Bambara uses postpositions in much the same manner as languages like English and French use prepositions. These postpositions are found after the verb and are used to express direction, location, and in some cases, possession.

===Loan words===
In urban areas, many Bambara conjunctions have been replaced in everyday use by French borrowings that often mark code-switches. The [[Bamako]] dialect makes use of sentences like: ''N taara Kita mais il n'y avait personne là-bas.'' : ''I went to Kita [Bambara] but there was no one there [French].'' The sentence in Bambara alone would be ''{{unicode|N taara Kita nka mɔgɔsi tuntɛ yen}}.'' The French proposition &quot;est-ce-que&quot; is also used in Bambara; however, it is pronounced more slowly and as three syllables, {{IPA|[ɛsəkə]}}.

Bambara uses many French loan words. For example, some people might say:
''{{unicode|I ka kulosi ye jauni ye}}'': &quot;Your skirt is yellow&quot; (using a derivation of the French word for yellow, jaune.)

However, one could also say:
''{{unicode|I ka kulosi ye neremuguman ye}}'', also meaning &quot;your skirt is yellow.&quot; The original Bambara word for yellow comes from &quot;''neremugu'',&quot; ''mugu'' being flour made from [[nere]], a seed from a long seed pod. Neremugu is often used in sauces in Southern Mali.

Most French loan words are suffixed with the sound 'i'; this is particularly common when using French words which have a meaning not traditionally found in Mali. For example, the Bambara word for [[snow]] is ''niegei'', based on the French word for snow ''neige''. As there has never been snow in Mali, there has not been a traditional meaning for the word and thus no unique word in Bambara to describe it.

===Examples===
;''{{unicode|N bɛ bamanankan mɛn dɔɔni-dɔɔni}}''
:I understand/hear a little bit of Bambara (lit: I ''aux positive'' Bambara hear small-small)

;''{{unicode|I tɛna dumuni ke wa}}?''
:Aren't you going to eat? (lit: you ''aux negative future'' eating do ''question particle'')

;''{{unicode|Dou Mara be ameriki ali bi wa?}}''
:Is Dou Mara still living in the USA? (lit: Dou Mara still America in live ''question particle'')
Macire nana MALI la wa ? (did Macire come to Mali?)

==Music==
Malian artists such as [[Oumou Sangaré]], [[Rokia Traoré]], [[Ali Farka Toure]], [[Salif Keita]], [[Habib Koité]], and the blind couple [[Amadou &amp; Mariam]] often sing in Bambara. [[Mory Kante]] (He was born in Guinea to Malian Mother) Most famous song to date Yeke Yeke
[[Alpha Blondy]] often sings in Dioula, as does Aïda of the band, [[Métisse]].
Lyrics in Bambara occur on [[Stevie Wonder]]'s soundtrack [[Journey through the Secret Life of Plants]].
[[Tiken Jah Fakoly]] (reggae) often sings in Dioula and French.

'''Baku''' ({{lang-az|Bakı}}), sometimes spelled as '''Baki''' or '''Bakou''', is the capital, largest city, and largest port of [[Azerbaijan]] and the [[Caucasus]] region. It is located on the southern shore of the [[Absheron|Absheron Peninsula]], that projects into the Caspian Sea. The city consists of two principal parts: the downtown and the old [[Old City (Baku)|Inner City]] (21.5 [[hectare|ha]]). Baku's [[urban population]] at the beginning of 2009 was estimated at just over two million people.&lt;ref name=&quot;pop&quot;&gt;{{cite web

|title=Population by economic and administrative regions, urban settlements  at the beginning of the 2009
|accessdate=2009-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baku is divided into [[Baku#Governance|eleven administrative districts]] (raions) and 48 townships. Among these are the townships on islands in the [[Bay of Baku|Baku Bay]] and the town of [[Oil Rocks]] built on stilts in the [[Caspian Sea]], {{convert|60|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} away from Baku. The Inner City of Baku along with the [[Palace of the Shirvanshahs|Shirvanshah's Palace]] and [[Maiden Tower (Baku)|Maiden Tower]] were inscribed as a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] in 2000. According to the [[Lonely Planet]]'s ranking Baku is also amongst the world's top ten destinations for urban nightlife.&lt;ref name=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;{{cite news

The city also serves as the main economic hub of Azerbaijan. Many sizeable Azerbaijani institutions have their headquarters there, including [[State Oil Company of Azerbaijan Republic|SOCAR]], one of the world's top 100 companies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.turkishweekly.net/columnist/2487/state-oil-company-of-azerbaijan-republic-transition-from-national-to-transnational-company-or-demand-of-time.html State Oil Company of Azerbaijan Republic: Transition from National to Transnational Company or Demand of Time?]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Baku International Sea Trade Port]], sheltered by the islands of the [[Baku Archipelago]] to the east and the [[Absheron Peninsula]] to the north, is capable of handling two million tons of general and dry bulk cargoes per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldportsource.com/ports/AZE_Port_of_Baku_2192.php|title=Port of Baku|publisher =World Port Source|accessdate=2010-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==

The name Baku is widely believed to be derived from the old [[Persian language|Persian]] names of the city باد-کوبه ''Bād-kube'', meaning &quot;Wind-pounded city&quot;, in which ''bād'' means &quot;wind&quot; and ''kube'' is rooted in the verb کوبیدن ''kubidan'', &quot;to pound&quot;, thus referring to a place where wind is strong and pounding. Indeed, the city is renowned for its fierce winter snow storms and harsh winds.&lt;ref name=&quot;Web.archive.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iranchamber.com/podium/culture/020920_politicizing_linguistics.php |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071013212555/http://iranchamber.com/podium/culture/020920_politicizing_linguistics.php |archivedate=2007-10-13 |title=Culture &amp; Religion on Podium: Politicizing Linguistics |publisher=Web.archive.org |date= |accessdate=2009-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also believed that Baku refers to ''Baghkuh'', meaning &quot;Mount of God&quot;. ''Baga'' (now ''باغ'' ''bagh'') and ''kaufa'' (now ''kuh'') are the [[Old Persian language|Old Persian]] words for &quot;god&quot; and &quot;mountain&quot; respectively; the name ''Baghkuh'' may be compared with ''[[Baghdad|Baghdād]]'' (&quot;God-given&quot;) in which ''dād'' is the Old Persian word for &quot;give&quot;. [[Arabic language|Arabic]] sources refer to the city as ''Baku'', ''Bakukh'', ''Bakuya'', and ''Bakuye'', all of which seem to come from a Persian name.

Various different hypotheses were also proposed to explain the etymology of the word ''Baku''. According to L.G.Lopatinski&lt;ref&gt;Ган К.Ф. Oпыть объяснения кавказских географических названий. Тифлис, 1909&lt;/ref&gt; and Ali Huseynzade&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;.[http://window2baku.com/eng/9002toponimbaku.htm The Name “Baku”]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Baku'' is derived from [[Turkic language|Turkic]] word for &quot;hill&quot;. Caucasian history specialist [[Kerope Patkanov]] also explains the name as &quot;hill&quot; but in the [[Lak language]].&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt; The Turkish ''Islamic Encyclopedia'' presents the origin of the word ''Baku'' as being derived from the words ''Bey-Kyoy'', which mean &quot;the main city&quot; in Turkic. Also another theory suggest that the name Baku is derived from the ancient [[Caucasian Albania]]n city which present was called Baguan.

[[File:Atesgah.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The ancient site of [[Ateshgah of Baku|Fire Temple at Surakhany]] and its surroundings]]
The first written evidence for Baku dates to the 1st century AD&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worldheritage.heindorffhus.dk/frame-AzerbaijanBaku.htm|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080102011734/http://worldheritage.heindorffhus.dk/frame-AzerbaijanBaku.htm|archivedate=2008-01-02  |title=Azerbaijan - Walled City of Baku with the Shirvanshah's Palace...|author= |accessdate=2007-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of its history since that time has been linked to various [[Achaemenid Empire]].

The city became important after an earthquake destroyed [[Şamaxı|Shamakhy]] in the 12th century, when the ruling [[Shirvanshah]], [[Ahsitan I]], chose Baku as the new capital. In 1501, [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid]] [[Ismail I|Shah Ismail I]] laid siege to Baku. At this time the city was however enclosed within the lines of strong walls, which were washed by the sea on one side and protected by a wide trench on land. In 1540 Baku was again captured by the Safavid troops. In 1604 the Baku fortress was destroyed by Safavid shah [[Abbas I of Persia|Abbas I]].

On 26 June 1723, after a lasting siege using cannons, Baku surrendered to the Russians. According to [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]]'s decree the soldiers of two regiments (2,382 people) were left in the Baku garrison under the command of Prince Baryatyanski, the commandant of the city. In 1795, Baku was invaded by [[Mohammad Khan Qajar|Agha Muhammad Khan]] Qajar to defend against [[tsar]]ist Russia's ambitions to subjugate the South Caucasus. In the spring of 1796, by [[Catherine II of Russia|Catherine II]]'s order, General Zubov's troops began a major campaign in Transcaucasia. Baku surrendered after the first demand of Zubov who had sent 6,000 troops to capture the city. On 13 June 1796 the Russian flotilla entered Baku Bay and a garrison of Russian troops was placed in the city. General [[Pavel Tsitsianov]] was appointed Baku's commandant. Later, however, Czar [[Paul I of Russia|Paul I]] ordered him to cease the campaign and withdraw Russian forces. In March 1797 the tsarist troops left Baku but a new tsar, [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]], began to show a special interest in capturing Baku. In 1803, Tsitsianov reached an agreement with the Baku khan to compromise, but the agreement was soon annulled. On 8 February 1806, upon the surrendering of Baku, [[Baku Khanate|Huseyngulu khan]] of Baku stabbed and killed Tsitsianov at the gates of the city.

In 1813, Russia signed the [[Treaty of Gulistan]] with Persia, which provided for the cession of Baku and most of the [[Caucasus]] from [[Iran]] and their annexation by Russia.

===Oil boom===
{{further|[[Petroleum industry in Azerbaijan]]}}
[[File:102 329 nobel oilwells.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Nobel Brothers]]' oil wells in [[Balaxanı|Balakhani]], a suburb of Baku. In late 19th century.]]
Professor A.B. Wiliams Jackson of Columbia University in his work &quot;From Constantinople to the home of Omar Khayyam&quot; (1911) writes: ''&quot;Baku is a city founded upon oil, for to its inexhaustible founts of naphtha it owes its very existence, its maintenance, its prosperity...At present Baku produces one-fifth of the oil that is used in the world, and the immense output in crude petroleum from this single city far surpasses that in any other district where oil is found.^ Verily, the words of the Scriptures find illustration here : &quot;the rock poured me out rivers of oil.&quot; 

Oil is in the air one breathes, in one's nostrils, in one's eyes, in the water of the morning bath (though not in the drinking- water, for that is brought in bottles from distant mineral 
springs), in one's starched linen — everywhere. This is the impression one carries away from Baku, and it is certainly true in the environs.&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;Abraham Valentine Williams Jackson. {{cite web|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/fromconstantino00jackgoog#page/n10/mode/2up|title=From Constantinople to the Home of Omar Khayyam|publisher=The Macmillan Company, 1911, p. 26|accessdate = 10 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The first [[oil well]] was mechanically drilled in the [[Bibi-Heybat Mosque|Bibi-Heybat]] suburb of Baku in 1846, though a number of hand-dug wells predate it. Large-scale oil exploration started in 1872, when Russian imperial authorities auctioned the parcels of oil-rich land around Baku to private investors. Within a short period of time Swiss, British, French, Belgian, German, Swedish and American investors appeared in Baku, among them were the firms of the [[Robert Nobel|Nobel brothers]] together with the family [[Schuch|von Börtzell-Szuch]] (Carl Knut Börtzell, who also owned the [[Livadia Palace]]) and the [[Rothschild family]]. An industrial oil belt, better known as Black City, was established near Baku. By the beginning of the 20th century almost half of world production was being extracted in Baku.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.window2baku.com/eng/9001history_3.htm |title=Window2Baku.com |publisher=Window2Baku.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1917, after the [[October Revolution|October revolution]] and amidst the turmoil of World War I and the breakup of the [[Russian Empire]], Baku came under the control of the [[26 Baku Commissars|Baku Commune]], which was led by veteran Bolshevik [[Stepan Shahumyan|Stepan Shaumyan]]. Seeking to capitalize on the existing inter-ethnic conflicts, by spring 1918, Bolsheviks inspired and condoned civil warfare in and around Baku. During the infamous [[March Days]], Bolsheviks and [[Armenian Revolutionary Federation|Dashnaks]] seeking to establish control over the Baku streets, faced with armed Muslim groups. Muslims suffered a crushing defeat by the united forces of the Baku Soviet and then felt the whole unbridled ferocity of Dashnak teams. Some 12 000 Azeri became the victims of the massacre carried out by radical Armenians and Bolshevik troops.&lt;ref&gt;F. Kazemzadeh.

On 28 May 1918, the Azerbaijani faction of the [[Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic|Transcaucasian Sejm]] proclaimed the independent [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic]] (ADR) in [[Ganja, Azerbaijan|Ganja]]. Shortly after, Azerbaijani forces, with support of the [[Ottoman Army of Islam]] led by [[Nuri Killigil|Nuru Pasha]], started their advance into Baku, eventually capturing the city from the loose coalition of [[Bolshevik]]s, [[Socialist-Revolutionary Party|Esers]], [[Armenian Revolutionary Federation|Dashnaks]], [[Menshevik]]s and British forces under the command of General [[Lionel Dunsterville]] on 15 September 1918. Thousands of Armenians in the city were massacred in revenge for the earlier [[March Days]].&lt;ref&gt;Furuz Kazemzadeh, ''Struggle For Transcaucasia (1917 - 1921)'', New York Philosophical Library, 1951, p. 143-144&lt;/ref&gt; Baku became the capital of the ADR. On 28 April 1920, the [[11th Army (Soviet Union)|11th Red Army]] invaded Baku and reinstalled the Bolsheviks, making Baku the capital of the [[Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic]].

Baku is situated on the western coast of [[Caspian Sea]]. In the vicinity of the city there are a number of [[mud volcano]]es (Keyraki, Bogkh-bogkha, [[Lokbatan]] and others) and [[salt lake]]s ([[Lake Boyukshor|Boyukshor]], Khodasan and so on).

==Geography==

===Climate===
Baku has a [[semi-arid climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]]: ''BSk'') with hot and dry summers and cold and occasionally wet winters and strong winds all year long. However, unlike many other cities with this climate, Baku does not see extremely hot summers. This is basically due to its northerly [[latitude]] and the fact that it is located on a peninsula on the shore of the Caspian Sea.
Baku and the [[Absheron Peninsula]] on which it is situated, is the most arid part of Azerbaijan ([[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] here is around or less than {{convert|200|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} a year). The majority of the light annual precipitation occurs outside summer, but none of these months are particularly wet.
During Soviet times, Baku with its long hours of sunshine and dry healthy climate, was a vacation destination where citizens could enjoy beaches or relax in now-dilapidated [[destination spa|spa]] complexes overlooking the Caspian Sea. The city's past as a Soviet industrial center has left it as one of the most polluted cities in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;ForbesPollution&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.forbes.com/2008/02/26/pollution-baku-oil-biz-logistics-cx_tl_0226dirtycities.html |title=The World's Dirtiest Cities |publisher=Forbes.com |author=Tiffany M. Luck |date=2008-02-26 |accessdate=2010-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time Baku is noted as a very windy city throughout the year, and gale-force winds, the cold northern wind ''[[khazri]]'' and the warm southern wind ''[[gilavar]]'' are typical here in all seasons. Indeed, the city is renowned for its fierce winter snow storms and harsh winds.&lt;ref name=&quot;Web.archive.org&quot;/&gt;
The speed of the ''khazri'' sometimes reaches 144 kph (89&amp;nbsp;mph), which can cause damage to crops, trees and roof tiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.global-ict.mincom.gov.az/aboutazerb.php |title=Global ICT Conference : 25-28, November, 2004 : Baku, Azerbaijan |publisher=Global-ict.mincom.gov.az |date= |accessdate=2010-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The daily mean temperature in July and August averages {{convert|26.4|°C|°F}}, and there is very little rainfall during that season. During summer the ''khazri'' sweeps through which brings desired coolness in summer. Winter is cold and occasionally wet, with the daily mean temperature in January and February averaging {{convert|4.3|°C|°F}}. During winter the ''khazri'' sweeps through; driven by masses of polar air, temperatures on the coast frequently drop below freezing and makes it feel bitterly cold. Winter snow storms do occur, but are rare and snow usually remains only for a few days after each snowfall.

The average annual temperature in Baku and that of the Earth differ by less than {{convert|0.1|C-change|2|abbr=on}} : it is {{convert|14.2|°C|°F}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.window2baku.com/eng/9000capital.htm |title=Window to Baku |publisher=Window2baku.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 1988 Baku had very large Armenian, Russian, and Jewish populations which contributed to [[cultural diversity]] and added in various ways (music, literature, architecture) to Baku's history.
Under [[Communism]], the Soviets took over the majority of Jewish property in Baku and Kuba. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, [[President of Azerbaijan|Azerbaijani President]] [[Heydar Aliyev|Heydar Aliev]] has returned several synagogues and a Jewish college nationalized by the Soviets to the [[Jews|Jewish]] community. He has encouraged the restoration of these buildings and is well liked by the Jews of Azerbaijan. Renovation has begun on seven of the original 11 synagogues, including the Gilah synagogue, built in 1896, and the large Kruei Synagogue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Azerbaijan.html |title=JewishVirtualLibrary.org |publisher=JewishVirtualLibrary.org |date=2006-07-10 |accessdate=2010-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new [[Constitution of Azerbaijan|Azerbaijan constitution]] grants [[freedom of religion|religious freedom]] and asserts that there is no [[state religion]].

Today the vast majority of the population of Baku are ethnic [[Azerbaijani people|Azerbaijanis]] (more than 90%). The intensive growth of the population started in the middle of the 19th century when Baku was a small town with the population of about 7 thousand people. The population increased again from about 13,000 in the 1860s to 112,000 in 1897 and 215,000 in 1913, making Baku the largest city in the Caucasus region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-946.html |title=Country-data.com |publisher=Country-data.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baku has been a cosmopolitan city at certain times during its history, meaning ethnic Azerbaijanis did not constitute the majority of population.&lt;ref&gt;Audrey Altstadt, Conflict, Cleavage, and Change in Central Asia and the Caucasus, [[Cambridge University Press]], 1997, p. 112, table 4.1, Ethnic composition of Baku, 1897, 1903,1913&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003 Baku additionally had 153,400 [[internally displaced person]]s and 93,400 refugees.&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}}{{cite web|url=http://www.baku-online.com/ru/baku.htm|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070701132551/http://www.baku-online.com/ru/baku.htm|archivedate=2007-07-01|title=Баку|author= |accessdate=2007-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===
[[File:Bibi Heybat Mosque Baku 1.jpg|thumb|right|The 13th century [[Bibi-Heybat Mosque]]. The mosque was built over the tomb of a descendant of the Prophet [[Muhammad]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bibi&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Sharifov|first=Azad|title=Legend of the Bibi-Heybat Mosque|url=http://azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/63_folder/63_articles/63_bibiheybat.html|publisher=Azerbaijan International Magazine|accessdate=11 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The urban landscape of Baku is shaped by many communities. The religion with the largest community of followers is [[Islam]]. The majority of the Muslims are [[Shia Islam|Shia Muslims]], and the Republic of Azerbaijan has the second highest Shia population percentage in the world after [[Iran]].&lt;ref&gt;Juan Eduardo Campo,''Encyclopedia of Islam'', p.625&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zoroastrianism]] had a long history in Azerbaijan, evident in sites such as the [[Fire Temple of Baku]]&lt;ref&gt;Meena Iyer, ''Faith &amp; philosophy of Zoroastrianism'' (2009), p.323&lt;/ref&gt; or ceremonies like [[Nowruz]], and along with [[Manichaeism|Manichean]]. The city's notable mosques includes [[Juma Mosque (Baku)|Juma Mosque]], [[Taza Pir Mosque]], [[Bibi-Heybat Mosque]], [[Muhammad Mosque (Baku)|Muhammad Mosque]] and [[Taza Pir Mosque]].

There are some other faiths practiced among the different ethnic groups within the country. By article 48 of its [[Constitution of Azerbaijan|Constitution]], Azerbaijan is a [[secular state]] and ensures religious freedom. Religious minorities include [[Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodox Christians]], [[Levant|Catholic Levantines]] and [[Azerbaijani Jews|Ashkenazi]] [[Jews]].

==Economy==

Baku's largest industry is [[petroleum]], and its petroleum exports make it a large contributor to the Azerbaijan's [[balance of payments]]. The existence of petroleum has been known since the 8th century. In the 10th century, the Arabian traveler, Marudee, reported that both white and black oil were being extracted naturally from Baku.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/22_folder/22_articles/22_historyofoil.html |title=The History of Oil in Azerbaijan by Natig Aliyev |publisher=Azer.com |date= |accessdate=2009-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 15th century, oil for lamps was obtained from hand-dug surface wells.
Commercial exploitation began in 1872, and by the beginning of the 20th century the [[Petroleum industry in Azerbaijan|Baku oil fields]] were the largest in the world. Towards the end of the 20th century much of the onshore petroleum had been exhausted, and drilling had extended into the sea offshore. By the end of the 19th century [[skilled worker]]s and specialists flocked to Baku. By 1900 the city had more than 3,000 oil wells, of which 2,000 were producing oil at industrial levels. Baku ranked as one of the largest centres for the production of [[Petroleum industry|oil industry]] equipment before World War II. The World War II [[Battle of Stalingrad]] was fought to determine who would have control of the Baku oil fields. Fifty years before the battle, Baku produced half of the world's oil supply: Azerbaijan and the United States are the only two countries ever to have been the world's majority oil producer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Aghazade|first=Emil|title=Азербайджан: сто лет надежд|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/russian/business/newsid_4649000/4649873.stm|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=12 May 2011|date=2005-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Currently the oil economy of Baku is undergoing a resurgence, with the development of the massive [[Azeri–Chirag–Guneshli|Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli]] field (Shallow water Gunashli by [[State Oil Company of Azerbaijan Republic|SOCAR]], deeper areas by a consortium led by [[BP]]), development of the [[Shah Deniz gas field]], the expansion of the [[Sangachal Terminal]] and the construction of the [[Baku–Tbilisi–Ceyhan pipeline|BTC Pipeline]].

The [[Baku Stock Exchange]] is Azerbaijan's largest [[stock exchange]], and largest in the [[Caucasus|Caucasian]] region by [[market capitalization]]. A relatively large number of transnational companies are headquartered in Baku. International banks with branches in Baku include [[HSBC]], [[Société Générale]] and [[Credit Suisse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Abdullayev|first=Rovshan|title=Which foreign banks has Azerbaijan capital been trusted in? |url=http://www.nhmt-az.org/ts_general/eng/news/n-6.htm|accessdate=6 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Bloomberg BusinessWeek]], Baku ranks as one of the most expensive cities in the world, alongside [[Vienna]] and Berlin in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://images.businessweek.com/ss/09/06/0615_most_expensive_cities/21.htm |title=World's Most Expensive Cities 2009 |publisher=Images.businessweek.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vz.ru/news/2009/6/21/299609.html Назван самый дорогой город СНГ] {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tourism and shopping===
Baku is one of Caucasus most important tourist destinations; with hotels in city earning 7 million euros in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://azerbaijan24.com/component/content/article/1-latest-news/224-hotels-in-baku.html |title=Hotels in Baku earned 6,8 million euros last year |publisher=Azerbaijan24.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many sizeable world [[hotel chain]]s have presence in the city. Baku boasts many popular tourist and entertainment spots, such as the downtown [[Fountains Square, Baku|Fountains Square]], the One and Thousand Nights Beach, [[Shikhov Beach]] and [[Oil Rocks]]. Baku's vicinities feature [[Yanar Dag]], an ever-blazing spot of natural gas. On 2 September 2010, with the innauguration of [[National Flag Square]], Baku became home to world's tallest [[flagpole]], included to the [[Guinness Book of Records]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Azerbaijani flag flies on world's tallest flagpole |url=http://news.az/articles/22041 |publisher=news.az |accessdate=2 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=İşte dünyanın en yüksek bayrak direği |url=http://www.ntvmsnbc.com/id/25128411/ |language=Turkish |publisher=ntvmsnbc.com |accessdate=2 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baku has several [[shopping mall]]s, including [[Park Bulvar]] and the Amay Shopping Center, Azerbaijan's largest inner city shopping mall. The retail areas contain shops from chain stores up to high-end boutiques such as [[Gucci]], [[Armani|Emporio Armani]], [[Versace]], [[Burberry]], [[Salvatore Ferragamo]], [[Dolce &amp; Gabbana]] and [[Bulgari]].

==Culture==
[[File:Nizami Ganjavi Museum - Baku.jpg|thumb|right|[[Nizami Museum of Azerbaijan Literature]]]]
The city has many amenities that offer a wide range of cultural activities, drawing both from a rich local dramatic portfolio and an international repertoire. It also boasts many museums, most notably featuring historical artifacts and [[art museum|art]]. Many of the city's cultural sites were celebrated in 2009 when Baku was designated an Islamic Culture Capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://abc.az/eng/news/41154.html| title=Closing ceremony of Cultural Year &quot;Baku- Islamic Culture Capital-2009&quot; conducted in Azerbaijan| author=Azerbaijan Business Center| accessdate=5 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baku also chosen to host [[Eurovision Dance Contest 2010]].

Among Baku's prestigious cultural venues are [[Azerbaijan State Philharmonic Hall]], [[Azerbaijan State Academic Opera and Ballet Theatre]]. The main [[movie theater|movie theatre]] is Azerbaijan Cinema.
Festivals include the Baku International Film Festival, [[Baku International Jazz Festival]], Novruz Festival, ''Gül Bayramı'' (Flower Festival) and the National Theater Festival.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news.bakililar.az/news_v_azerbayjane_otmechayut_35946.html В Азербайджане отмечают праздник цветов.] {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zaman.com.tr/haber.do?haberno=982418&amp;title=azerbaycanda-gul-bayrami-ve-aliyevin-dogum-gunu-kutlaniyor Azerbaycan'da Gül Bayramı ve Aliyev'in doğum günü kutlanıyor] {{tr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; International and local exhibitions are provided in [[Baku Expo Center]].

===Architecture===
{{Main|Architecture in Baku}}

Baku has wildly varying architecture, ranging from the [[Old City (Baku)|Old City]] core to modern buildings and the spacious layout of Baku port. Many of the city's most impressive buildings were built during the [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic]] period, when architectural elements of the European styles were combined in [[eclecticism|eclectic]] style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/24_folder/24_articles/24_architecture.html |title=Baku's Architecture:A Fusion of East and West |publisher=Azer.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baku thus has an original and unique appearance, earning it a reputation as the 'Paris of the East'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.window2baku.com/006development.htm Архитектурное развитие города] {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Late modern and postmodern architecture began to appear in the early 2000s. With economic development, old buildings such as Atlant House were razed to make way for new ones. Buildings with all-glass shells have appeared around the city, the most prominent examples being the [[SOCAR Tower]] and [[Flame Towers]]. These projects also brought attention of international media as notable programs as [[Discovery Channel]]'s [[Extreme Engineering]] featured changes in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Heydar Aliyev Cultural Center And Flame Towers|url=http://science.discovery.com/tv/build-bigger/projects/azerbaijan/heydar-aliyev-cultural-center.html|publisher=Discovery Communications|accessdate=25 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

====Historical core====
[[File:Baku08.jpg|thumb|right|Part of the [[Walled City of Baku]].]]
{{main|Inner City (Baku)|Palace of the Shirvanshahs|Maiden Tower (Baku)}}
Most of the walls and towers, strengthened after the Russian conquest in 1806, survived. This section is picturesque, with its maze of narrow alleys and ancient buildings: the cobbled streets past the [[Palace of the Shirvanshahs]], two [[Caravanserai|caravansaries]], the baths and the [[Friday Mosque|Juma Mosque]] (which used to house the [[Azerbaijan National Carpet Museum|Azerbaijan National Carpet and Arts Museum]], but is now a [[mosque]] again).

The '''balalaika''' ({{lang-ru|балала́йка}}, {{IPA-ru|bəlɐˈlajkə|pron}}) is a [[string instrument|stringed]] [[musical instrument]] of [[Russians|Russian]] origin, with a characteristic [[triangle|triangular]] body and three strings.

The balalaika ''family of instruments'' includes, from the highest-pitched to the lowest, the prima balalaika, secunda balalaika, alto balalaika, bass balalaika and contrabass balalaika. All have three-sided bodies, spruce or fir tops, backs made of 3-9 wooden sections, and usually three strings. The prima balalaika is played with the fingers, the sekunda and alto either with the fingers or a plectrum, depending on the music being played, and the basses and contrabasses (equipped with extension legs which rest on the floor) are played with leather plectrums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.balalaika.org/_instruments.htm| title= The Washington Balalaika Society | publisher=www.balalaika.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==

The earliest mention of the term ''balalaika'' dates back to an AD 1688 Russian document.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skaz1.com/balalaika.engl.html  Balalaika - article by Dmitry Belinskiy from the newspaper ''Krymskaya Pravda''. Balalaika music, video]&lt;/ref&gt;
The term became widely used in Ukrainian language documents from 1717-1732. According to one theory, it is thought that the term was borrowed into Russian where, in literary language, it first appeared in a poem by V. Maikov &quot;Elysei&quot; in 1771.

==Types==
[[image:Contrabassbalalaika.jpg|thumb|A contrabass Balalaika]]

The modern balalaika is found in the following sizes:

*piccolo (rare)
*prima
*sekunda
*alto
*bass
*contrabass

The most common [[solo (music)|solo]] instrument is the [[prima]], which is tuned E-E-A (the two lower [[strings (music)|strings]] being [[tune]]d to the same pitch). Sometimes the balalaika is tuned &quot;guitar style&quot; to G-B-D (mimicking the three highest strings of the [[Russian guitar]]), making it easier to play for Russian guitar players, although balalaika purists frown on this tuning. It can also be tuned to E-A-D, like its cousin, the [[domra]], to make it easier for domra soloists to play the instrument, and still have a balalaika sound. The folk (pre-Andreev) tuning is D-F#-A, making it easier to play certain riffs.

Factory-made six-string prima balalaikas with three sets of double courses are also common and popular, particularly in Ukraine. These instruments have three double courses similar to the stringing of the [[mandolin]] and use a &quot;guitar&quot; tuning. Four string alto balalaikas are also encountered and are used in the orchestra of the [[Piatnistky Folk Choir]].

The piccolo, prima, and secunda balalaikas were originally strung with gut with the thinnest melody string made of stainless steel. Today, [[nylon]] strings are usually used in place of gut.

===Technique===

An important part of balalaika technique is the use of the left thumb to fret notes on the lower string, particularly on the prima, where it is used to form [[chord (music)|chord]]s.  The side of the [[index finger]] of the right hand is used to sound notes on the prima, while a [[plectrum]] is used on the larger sizes. One can play the prima with a plectrum, but it is considered rather [[heterodox]] to do so.

Due to the gigantic size of the contrabass's strings, it is not uncommon for the plectrum to be made of a leather shoe or boot [[heel (shoe)|heel]]. The bass and contrabass balalaika rest on the ground on a wooden or metal pin drilled into one of its corners.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://stringedinstrumentdatabase.110mb.com/a.htm The Stringed Instrument Database]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===The pre-Andreyev period===
Early representations of the balalaika show it with anywhere from two to six strings, which resembles certain Central Asian instruments.  Similarly, [[fret]]s on earlier balalaikas were made of animal gut and tied to the neck so that they could be moved around by the player at will (as is the case with the modern [[baglama|saz]], which allows for the [[microtonal]] playing distinctive to Turkish and Central Asian music).

The term first appeared in the Ukrainian documents in the 18th century in documents from 1717-1732. It is thought that the term was borrowed into Russian where it first appeared a poem by V. Maikov &quot;Elysei&quot; in 1771. 
In the 19th century the balalaika evolved into a triangular instrument with a neck substantially shorter than its Asian counterparts.  It was popular as a village instrument for centuries, particularly with the ''[[skomorokh]]s'', sort of free-lance musical [[jester]]s whose tunes ridiculed the [[Tsar]], the [[Russian Orthodox Church]], and Russian society in general.  

A popular notion is that the three sides and the strings of the balalaika are supposed to represent the Holy Trinity.  This idea, while whimsical, is quite difficult to reconcile when one is confronted with the fact that at various times in Russian history, the playing of the balalaika was banned because of its use by the ''[[skomorokhi]]'', who were generally highly irritating to both Church and State. Musical instruments are not allowed in Russian Orthodox liturgy. A likelier reason for the triangular shape is given by the writer and historian [[Nikolai Gogol]] in his unfinished novel ''Dead Souls.'' He states that a balalaika was made by peasants out of a pumpkin. If you quarter a pumpkin, you are left with a balalaika shape. Another theory is: Before Tsar [[Peter The Great|Peter I]], instruments were not allowed in Russia. When Peter allowed them, only the boat builders knew how to work with wood. The balalaika looks a little like the front of a boat, if held horizontally. Another theory comes from a Russian tale: during the [[Mongol invasion of Rus]], a Russian man from [[Nizhny Novgorod]] was captured by Mongols, but the Mongol Khan liked him because of his musical talent, released him and gave him a guitar. When the Russian man returned home, he took three of the strings out of the guitar, so that he would be able to repair his guitar if he breaks one of the strings, and that way he was left with a three-string guitar.

===The Andreyev period===
In the 1880s [[Vasily Vasilievich Andreyev]] developed a standardized balalaika made with the assistance of violin maker V. Ivanov. A few years later St. Petersburg craftsman Paserbsky made a balalaika with a chromatic set of frets and also a number of balalaikas in orchestral sizes with the same tunings found in modern instruments. Andreyev arranged many traditional Russian folk songs and melodies for the orchestra and also composed many tunes of his own.

===The balalaika outside of Russia===
Interest in Russian folk instruments has grown outside of Russia. Orchestras of Russian folk instruments exist in many countries of western Europe, Scandinavia, USA, Canada, Australia and Japan. Some of the groups include ethnic Russians, however in recent times the growth in interest in the Balalaika by non-ethnic Russians has been considerable.

Interests in the balalaika first started after Andreyev's tour of North America in the early 20th century. A number of Andreyev's students also toured the west in 1909-12. In 1957 the Scandinavian Balalaika Association was formed. In 1977 a similar organization was formed in the USA.

Oleg Bernov of the Russian-American rock band the [[Red Elvises]] plays a red electrified contrabass balalaika during the band's North American tours.

Australian band, VulgarGrad, fronted by actor [[Jacek Koman]], which plays songs of the Russian criminal underground, uses a contrabass balalaika.

Norwegian all-girl pop band [[Katzenjammer (band)|Katzenjammer]] uses two contrabass balalaikas, both of which have cat faces painted on the front. They are named Børge and Akerø.

[[Ian Anderson (musician)|Ian Anderson]] plays balalaika on two songs from the 1969 [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]] album ''[[Stand Up (Jethro Tull album)|Stand Up]]'': &quot;Jeffrey Goes To Leicester Square&quot; and &quot;Fat Man&quot;.

Balalaikas of all sizes are prominently displayed in the official video for [[Basement Jaxx]]'s 2006 single &quot;Take Me Back To Yor Place&quot;.

The balalaika is mentioned in both [[The Beatles]]' song &quot;[[Back in the U.S.S.R.]]&quot; and the [[Scorpions (band)|Scorpions]]' song &quot;[[Wind of Change (song)|Wind of Change]]&quot;.

==Balalaika orchestra==
[[Image:Balalaika.jpg|thumb|A souvenir balalaika]]
The end result of Andreyev's labours was the development of a strong orchestral tradition in Tsarist Russia, and, later, the [[Soviet Union]].  The balalaika orchestra in its full form—balalaikas, [[domra]]s, [[gusli]], [[bayan (music)|bayan]], [[kugikla]]s, [[Vladimir Shepherd's Horns]], [[garmoshka]]s and several types of [[percussion instrument]]s -- has a distinctive sound: strangely familiar to the ear, yet decidedly not entirely Western. 

Russian folk music had its roots in the village. With the establishment of the Soviet system and a Proletarian cultural direction - the culture of the working classes, which included that of village labourers was actively supported by the Soviet establishment. 
Not surprisingly, the concept of the balalaika orchestra was adopted wholeheartedly by the Soviet government as something distinctively proletarian (that is, from the working classes) and also progressive. Enormous amounts of energy and time were devoted by the Soviet government to foster conservatory study of the balalaika, from which highly skilled ensemble groups such as the [[Osipov State Balalaika Orchestra]] emerged. Balalaika virtuosi such as [[Boris Feoktistov]] and [[Pavel Necheporenko]] became stars both inside and outside the Soviet Union. The movement was so powerful that even the renowned [[Red Army Choir]] which initially used a normal symphonic orchestra, changed its instrumentation replacing [[violin]]s, [[viola]]s and [[violoncello]]s with orchestral balalaikas and [[domra]]s.

The '''Bank of China Tower''' (abbreviated '''BOC Tower''') is one of the most recognisable skyscrapers in [[Central, Hong Kong|Central]], Hong Kong. It houses the headquarters for the [[Bank of China (Hong Kong) Limited]]. The building is located at 1 Garden Road, in [[Central and Western District]] on Hong Kong Island.&lt;ref name=bochk /&gt;

Designed by [[I. M. Pei]], the building is {{convert|307|m|ft|1|abbr=on}} high with two masts reaching {{convert|360.9|m|ft|1|abbr=on}} high.&lt;ref name=bochk /&gt;
It was the tallest building in Hong Kong and Asia from 1989 to 1992, and it was the first building outside the United States to break the 305 m (1,000&amp;nbsp;ft) mark. It is now the fourth tallest skyscraper in Hong Kong, after [[International Commerce Centre]], [[Two International Finance Centre]] and [[Central Plaza]].

==Plot history==
The 6,700m² site on which the building is constructed was formerly the location of [[Murray House]]. After its brick-by-brick relocation to [[Stanley, Hong Kong|Stanley]], the site was sold by the Government for &quot;only HK$1 billion&quot; in August 1982 amidst growing concern over the future of Hong Kong in the run-up to the [[Transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong|transfer of sovereignty]].

Once developed, gross floor area was expected to be 100,000 m².&lt;ref name=&quot;dearfriends&quot;&gt;Philip Bowring &amp; Mary Lee, [http://sunzi1.lib.hku.hk/newspaper/view/25_01.02/19852.pdf Dear friends...], pg 114 ''[[Far Eastern Economic Review]]'', 13 August 1982&lt;/ref&gt; The original project was intended for completion on the [[Numbers in Chinese culture|auspicious]] date of 8 August 1988. However, owing to project delays, groundbreaking took place in March 1985, almost two years late. It was topped out in 1989, and occupied on 15 June 1990.&lt;!--from Chinese article --&gt;

The building was initially built by the Hong Kong Branch of the Bank of China; its Garden Road entrance continues to display the name &quot;Bank of China&quot;, rather than BOCHK. The top four and the bottom 19 stories are used by the Bank, while the other floors are leased out.&lt;!--from Chinese article --&gt; Ownership has since been transferred to BOCHK, although the Bank of China has leased back several floors for use by its own operations in Hong Kong.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}

===Favouritism controversy===
The Government had apparently given preferential treatment to Chinese companies, and was again criticised for the apparent preferential treatment to the BOCHK.&lt;ref name=dearfriends/&gt;

The price paid was half the amount of the 6,250 m² Admiralty II plot, for which the [[MTR Corporation]] paid HK$1.82 billion in cash. The BOC would make initial payment of $60 million, with the rest payable over 13 years at 6% interest. The announcement of the sale was also poorly handled, and a dive in business confidence ensued. The [[Hang Seng Index]] fell 80 points, and the [[Hong Kong dollar|HK$]] lost 1.5% of its value the next day.&lt;ref name=dearfriends/&gt;

== Design and feng shui ==

Designed by [[Pritzker Prize]]-winning architect [[I. M. Pei]], the building is 305.0 metres (1,000.7&amp;nbsp;ft) high with two masts reaching 357.4 metres (1,205.4&amp;nbsp;ft) high. The 72 story building is located near [[Central (MTR)|Central MTR station]]. This was the tallest building in Hong Kong and Asia from 1989 to 1992, the first building outside the United States to break the 305 m (1,000&amp;nbsp;ft) mark, and  the first composite [[space frame]] high-rise building. That also means it was the tallest outside the United States from its completion year, 1990. It is now the fourth tallest skyscraper in Hong Kong, after [[International Commerce Centre]], [[Two International Finance Centre]] and [[Central Plaza]].

A small observation deck on the 43rd floor of the building is open to the public.

The [[structural expressionism]] adopted in the design of this building resembles growing bamboo shoots, symbolising livelihood and prosperity. The whole structure is supported by the five steel columns at the corners of the building, with the triangular frameworks transferring the weight of the structure onto these five columns. It is covered with glass curtain walls.  While its distinctive look makes it one of Hong Kong's most identifiable landmarks today, it was the source of some controversy at one time, as the bank is the only major building in Hong Kong to have bypassed the  convention of consulting with [[feng shui]] masters on matters of design prior to construction.

The building has been criticised by some practitioners of feng shui for its sharp edges and its negative symbolism by the numerous 'X' shapes in its original design, though Pei modified the design to some degree before construction following this feedback. The building's profile from some angles resembles that of a [[Cleaver (knife)|meat cleaver]]. In Feng Shui, this is described as a ''cleaver building'' and it is not difficult to observe that it is facing the [[HSBC Hong Kong headquarters building]] in this guise.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}

== Cultural references ==
The BOC Tower's bold futuristic design has made it into popular culture. It is the only Hong Kong landmark included in the city-building/simulation computer games ''[[SimCity 3000]]'' and ''[[SimCity 4]]''. The digitally modified facade of the building is featured in the science fiction television series ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'' as the [[Starfleet]] &quot;Communications Research Center&quot;. The building features alongside the Emirates Towers in the racing game '[[Burnout Paradise]]' In the film [[Category 7: The End of the World]], the tower is destroyed by a tornado.

'''&quot;Blind&quot; Lemon Jefferson''' (September 24, 1893{{ndash}}December 19, 1929) was a [[blues]] [[singer]] and [[guitar]]ist from [[Texas]]. He was one of the most popular blues singers of the 1920s, and has been titled &quot;Father of the [[Texas Blues]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Dicaire, 140, 143.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Jefferson's singing and self-accompaniment were distinctive as a result of his high-pitched voice and originality on the guitar.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dicaire, 144&quot;&gt;Dicaire, 144.&lt;/ref&gt; He was not influential on some younger blues singers of his generation, as they did not seek to imitate him as they did other commercially successful artists.&lt;ref&gt;Charters.&lt;/ref&gt; However, later blues and rock and roll musicians attempted to imitate both his songs and his musical style.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dicaire, 144&quot; /&gt; His recordings would later influence such legends as [[B.B. King]], [[T-Bone Walker]], [[Lightnin' Hopkins]], [[Canned Heat]], [[Son House]] and [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]].

==Biography==
===Early life===
Lemon Jefferson was born [[blindness|blind]] near [[Coutchman, Texas]] in [[Freestone County, Texas|Freestone County]], near present-day [[Wortham, Texas]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Dicaire, 140&quot;&gt;Dicaire, 140.&lt;/ref&gt; Jefferson was one of eight children born to [[sharecroppers]] Alex and Clarissa Jefferson.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dicaire, 140&quot; /&gt; Disputes regarding his exact birth date derive from contradictory census records and draft registration records. By 1900, the family was farming southeast of [[Streetman, Texas]], and Lemon Jefferson's birth date is indicated as September 1893 in the [[1900 census]].&lt;ref&gt;1900 US Census; Census Place: Justice Precinct 5, Freestone, Texas; Roll: T623 1636; Page: 3A; Enumeration District: 37.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[1910 United States Census|1910 census]], taken in May before his birthday, further confirms his birth year as 1893, and indicated the family was farming northwest of Wortham, near Lemon Jefferson's birthplace.&lt;ref&gt;1910 US Census; Census Place: Justice Precinct 6, Navarro, Texas; Roll: T624_1580; Page: 17B; Enumeration District: 98; Image: 982.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In his 1917 [[Conscription in the United States|draft registration]], Jefferson gave his birth date as October 26, 1894, further stating that he then lived in [[Dallas, Texas]], and that he had been blind from birth.&lt;ref&gt;World War I Draft Registration records; Dallas County, Texas; Roll: 1952850; Draft Board: 2&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[1920 United States Census|1920 Census]], he is recorded as having returned to the Freestone County area, and he was living with his half-brother Kit Banks on a farm between Wortham and Streetman.&lt;ref&gt;1920 US Census;Census Place: Kirvin, Freestone, Texas; Roll: T625_1805; Page: 3A; Enumeration District: 24; Image: 231.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Jefferson began playing the guitar in his early teens, and soon after he began performing at [[picnics]] and parties.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dicaire, 140&quot; /&gt; He also became a [[busking|street musician]], playing in [[East Texas]] towns in front of [[barber]]shops and on corners.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dicaire, 140&quot; /&gt; According to his cousin, Alec Jefferson, quoted in the notes for ''Blind Lemon Jefferson, Classic Sides'':
{{quote|They were rough. Men were [[prostitution|hustling women]] and selling [[bootleg liquor|bootleg]] and Lemon was singing for them all night... he'd start singing about eight and go on until four in the morning... mostly it would be just him sitting there and playing and singing all night.''}}

By the early 1910s, Jefferson began traveling frequently to Dallas, where he met and played with fellow blues musician [[Leadbelly]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Dicaire, 141&quot;&gt;Dicaire, 141.&lt;/ref&gt; In Dallas, Jefferson was one of the earliest and most prominent figures in the blues movement developing in the [[Deep Ellum]] area of Dallas. Jefferson likely moved to Deep Ellum in a more permanent fashion by 1917, where he met Aaron Thibeaux Walker, also known as [[T-Bone Walker]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Dicaire, 141&quot; /&gt; Jefferson taught Walker the basics of blues guitar, in exchange for Walker's occasional services as a guide.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dicaire, 141&quot; /&gt; Also, by the early 1920s, Jefferson was earning enough money for his musical performances to support a wife, and possibly a child.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dicaire, 141&quot; /&gt; However, firm evidence for both his marriage and any offspring is unavailable.

===The beginning of the recording career===
Until Jefferson, very few artists had recorded solo voice and blues guitar, the first of which was vocalist [[Sara Martin]] and guitarist Sylvester Weaver. Jefferson's music is uninhibited and represented the classic sounds of everyday life from a [[honky-tonk]] to a country picnic to street corner blues to work in the burgeoning oil fields, a reflection too of his interest in mechanical things.&lt;ref&gt;Joe W. Specht, [[McMurry University]], [[Abilene, Texas|Abilene]], [[Texas]], &quot;Oil Well Blues: African-American Oil Patch Songs&quot;, joint meeting of [[East Texas Historical Association]] and [[West Texas Historical Association]], annual meeting in [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]], February 27, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Jefferson did what very few had ever done; became a successful solo guitarist and male vocalist in the commercial recording world.&lt;ref name=&quot;Evans 2000 83–116&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|title=Music Innovation in the Blues of Blind Lemon Jefferson|journal=Black Music Research Journal |year=2000|first=David|last=Evans|coauthors= |volume=20|issue=1|pages=83–116|id= |url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/779317|format=|accessdate=2010-02-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   
Unlike many artists who were &quot;discovered&quot; and recorded in their normal venues, in December 1925 or January 1926, he was taken to [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], to record his first tracks. Uncharacteristically, Jefferson's first two recordings from this session were [[Gospel music|gospel]] songs (&quot;I Want to be like Jesus in my Heart&quot; and &quot;All I Want is that Pure Religion&quot;), released under the name '''Deacon L. J. Bates'''. This led to a second recording session in March 1926. His first releases under his own name, &quot;Booster Blues&quot; and &quot;Dry Southern Blues,&quot; were hits; this led to the release of the other two songs from that session, &quot;Got the Blues&quot; and &quot;Long Lonesome Blues,&quot; which became a runaway success, with sales in six figures. He recorded about 100 tracks between 1926 and 1929; 43 [[gramophone record|records]] were issued, all but one for [[Paramount Records]]. Unfortunately, Paramount Records' studio techniques and quality were bad, and the resulting recordings sound no better than if they had been recorded in a hotel room. In fact, in May 1926, Paramount had Jefferson re-record his hits &quot;Got the Blues&quot; and &quot;Long Lonesome Blues&quot; in the superior facilities at [[Autograph Records|Marsh Laboratories]], and subsequent releases used that version. Both versions appear on compilation albums and may be compared.

===Success with Paramount Records===
[[File:ParamountLabelBLJefferson.jpg|thumb|Label of a Blind Lemon Jefferson Paramount record from 1926]] 
It was largely due to the popularity of artists such as Blind Lemon Jefferson and contemporaries such as [[Blind Blake]] and [[Ma Rainey]] that Paramount became the leading recording company for the blues in the 1920s.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} Jefferson's earnings reputedly enabled him to buy a car and employ chauffeurs (although there is debate over the reliability of this as well); he was given a Ford car &quot;worth over $700&quot; by [[Mayo Williams]], Paramount's connection with the black community. This was a frequently seen compensation for recording rights in that market. Jefferson is known to have done an unusual amount of traveling for the time in the American South, which is reflected in the difficulty of pigeonholing his music into one regional category.&lt;ref&gt;It was Jefferson’s “old-fashioned sound and confident musicianship that made him easy to market.  His skillful guitar playing and impressive vocal ranges opened the door to a new era of opportunity for future solo male recording artists such as Furry Lewis, Charlie Patton, and Barbecue Bob.&lt;/ref&gt; It was Jefferson's “old-fashioned sound and confident musicianship that made him easy to market. His skillful guitar playing and impressive vocal ranges opened the door for a new generation of male solo blues performers such as Furry Lewis, Charlie Patton, and Barbecue Bob.&lt;ref name=&quot;Evans 2000 83–116&quot;/&gt; He sticks to no musical conventions, varying his [[riff]]s and rhythm and singing complex and expressive lyrics in a manner exceptional at the time for a &quot;simple country blues singer.&quot; According to North Carolina musician Walter Davis, Jefferson played on the streets in [[Johnson City, Tennessee]], during the early 1920s at which time Davis and fellow entertainer Clarence Greene learned the art of blues guitar.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Walter Davis: Fist and Skull Banjo,&quot; by Wayne Erbsen, Bluegrass Unlimited: March 1981, 22-26&lt;/ref&gt; 

Jefferson was reputedly unhappy with his royalties (although Williams said that Jefferson had a bank account containing as much as $1500). In 1927, when Williams moved to [[OKeh Records]], he took Jefferson with him, and OKeh quickly recorded and released Jefferson's &quot;Matchbox Blues&quot; backed with &quot;Black Snake Moan,&quot; which was to be his only OKeh recording, probably because of contractual obligations with Paramount. Jefferson's two songs released on Okeh have considerably better sound quality than on his Paramount records at the time. When he had returned to Paramount a few months later, &quot;Matchbox Blues&quot; had already become such a hit that Paramount re-recorded and released two new versions, under [[record producer|producer]] [[Arthur Laibly]].

In 1927, Jefferson recorded another of his now classic songs, the haunting &quot;[[See That My Grave Is Kept Clean]]&quot; (once again using the pseudonym Deacon L. J. Bates) along with two other uncharacteristically spiritual songs, &quot;He Arose from the Dead&quot; and &quot;Where Shall I Be.&quot; Of the three, &quot;See That My Grave Is Kept Clean&quot; became such a big hit that it was re-recorded and re-released in 1928.

===Stories===
As his fame grew, so did the tales regarding his life, often personally involving the teller. [[T-Bone Walker]] states that as a boy, he was employed by Jefferson to lead him around the streets of Dallas; he would have been of the appropriate age at the time. A Paramount employee told biographer [[Orrin Keepnews]] that Jefferson was a womanizing sloppy drunk; on the other hand, Jefferson's neighbor in Chicago, [[Romeo Nelson]], reports him as being &quot;warm and cordial,&quot; and singer [[Rube Lacy]] states that Jefferson always refused to play on a Sunday, &quot;even if you give me two hundred.&quot; He is claimed to have earned money wrestling before his musical success, which is further claimed as proof that he was not blind at the time. [[Victoria Spivey]] elliptically credits Jefferson as someone who &quot;could sure ''feel'' his way around.&quot;

===Death and grave===
Jefferson died in Chicago at 10am on 19 December 1929, of what his death certificate called &quot;probably acute myocarditis&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; For many years, apocryphal rumors circulated that a jealous lover had poisoned his coffee, but a more likely scenario is that he died of a heart attack after becoming disoriented during a snowstorm (i.e., he froze to death). Some have said that Jefferson died from a heart attack after being attacked by a dog in the middle of the night. More recently, the book, &quot;Tolbert's Texas,&quot; claimed that he was killed while being robbed of a large royalty cash payment by a guide escorting him to Union Station to catch a train home to Texas. Paramount Records paid for the return of his body to Texas by train, accompanied by pianist [[Will Ezell]]. Jefferson was buried at Wortham Negro Cemetery (later Wortham Black Cemetery). Far from his grave being kept clean, it was unmarked until 1967, when a Texas Historical Marker was erected in the general area of his plot, the precise location being unknown. By 1996, the cemetery and marker were in poor condition, but a new granite headstone was erected in 1997. In 2007, the cemetery's name was changed to Blind Lemon Memorial Cemetery and his gravesite is kept clean by a cemetery committee in Wortham, Texas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/view/JJ/fje1.html &quot;Jefferson, Blind Lemon&quot;], ''Handbook of Texas Online'', [[Texas State Historical Association]], May 30, 2010. Published by the Texas State Historical Association
and distributed in partnership with the [[University of North Texas]]. &quot;In 2007 the name of the cemetery was changed to Blind Lemon Memorial Cemetery.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discography and awards==
{{See also|Blind Lemon Jefferson discography}}

Jefferson had an intricate and fast style of guitar playing and a particularly high-pitched voice. He was a founder of the [[Texas blues]] sound and an important influence on other blues singers and guitarists, including [[Lead Belly]] and [[Lightnin' Hopkins]]. The white North Carolina performer [[Doc Watson|Arthel &quot;Doc&quot; Watson]] credited listening to Jefferson's recordings as his first exposure to the blues, which would powerfully influence his own style.

He was the author of many tunes covered by later musicians, including the classic &quot;[[See That My Grave Is Kept Clean]]&quot;. Another of his tunes, &quot;[[Matchbox (song)|Matchbox Blues]]&quot;, was recorded more than 30 years later by [[The Beatles]], albeit in a [[rockabilly]] version credited to [[Carl Perkins]], who himself did not credit Jefferson on his 1955 recording. Given this influence, it is unfortunate that many of the details of his life remain shrouded in mystery, perhaps forever; even the only known picture of him, shown above, is heavily retouched, with a fake tie painted in by hand. However, at the time, &quot;[[race music]]&quot; and its white cousin, &quot;[[hillbilly music]]&quot;, were not considered to be worthy of consideration as art, rather as a low-cost product to be sold and soon forgotten.

:''For other uses, see [[Baku (disambiguation)]].''

{{nihongo|'''Baku'''|獏 or 貘}} are [[Japan]]ese supernatural beings that devour dreams and nightmares. They have a long history in Japanese [[folklore]] and art, and more recently have appeared in Japanese [[anime]] and [[manga]] (see examples cited below).

The Japanese term ''baku'' has two current meanings, referring to both the traditional dream-devouring creature and to the zoological [[tapir]] (e.g., the [[Malaysia]]n tapir).&lt;ref name=&quot;nakagawa&quot;&gt;Nakagawa Masako 1999 ''Sankai ibutsu: An early seventeenth-century Japanese illustrated manuscript''. Sino-Japanese Studies, 11:24-38. pages 33-34.&lt;/ref&gt;  In recent years, there have been changes in how the baku is depicted.

== History and Description ==

The traditional Japanese nightmare-devouring baku originates in [[Chinese folklore]] and was familiar in Japan as early as the [[Muromachi]] period (14th-15th century).&lt;ref&gt;Hori Tadao 2005 &quot;Cultural note on dreaming and dream study in the future: Release from nightmare and development of dream control technique,&quot; ''Sleep and Biological Rhythms'' 3 (2), 49–55.&lt;/ref&gt; Hori Tadao (2005) has described the dream-eating abilities attributed to the traditional baku and relates them to other preventatives against nightmare like the use of [[amulet]]s. [[Kaii-Yōkai Denshō Database]], citing a 1957 paper, and Mizuki (2004) also describe the dream-devouring capacities of the traditional baku.

An early 17th century Japanese manuscript, the ''Sankai Ibutsu'' (山海異物), describes the baku as a Chinese mythical [[Chimera (mythology)|chimera]] with an [[elephant]]’s trunk, [[rhinoceros]] eyes, an [[ox]] tail, and [[tiger]] paws, which in belief protected against pestilence and evil, although eating nightmares was not included among its abilities.&lt;ref name=&quot;nakagawa&quot;/&gt; However, in a 1791 Japanese wood-block illustration, a specifically dream-destroying baku is depicted with an elephant’s head, tusks, and trunk, with horns and tiger’s claws.&lt;ref&gt;Kern, Adam L. 2007 ''Manga from the Floating World: Comicbook culture and the kibyoshi of Edo Japan''. Cambridge: Harvard University Asian Center. page 236, figure 4.26.&lt;/ref&gt; The elephant’s head, trunk, and tusks are characteristic of baku portrayed in classical era (pre-[[Meiji period|Meiji]]) Japanese wood-block prints (see illustration) and in shrine, temple, and [[netsuke]] carvings.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sirasaki.co.jp/baku/baku.html. (Accessed September 5, 2007.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fv20070216a1.html. (Accessed September 8, 2007.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.onmarkproductions.com/html/shrine-guide-2.shtml. (Accessed September 8, 2007.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tokugawaantiques.com/product.php?productid=579. (Accessed September 8, 2007.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lacma.org/programs/ArtWorkMonth0306.aspx. (Accessed September 8, 2007.)&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in the Meiji era, [[Lafcadio Hearn]] (1902) described a baku with very similar attributes that was also able to devour nightmares.&lt;ref&gt;Hearn, Lafcadio 1902 Kottō: ''Being Japanese Curios, with Sundry Cobwebs''. Macmillan &amp; Co., Ltd. pages 245-248. ISBN 4-8613-3027-0.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern Representations ==

Since the 1980s, the baku appears not as a chimera of an elephant and tiger but as a zoologically recognizable tapir. Examples include [[Oshii Mamoru]]’s 1984 animated film ''[[Urusei Yatsura 2: Beautiful Dreamer|Beautiful Dreamer]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Oshii Mamoru 1984 ''Beautiful Dreamer.'' New York:US Manga Corp. ASIN: B0001Y4MRW.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ruh, Brian 2004 &lt;i&gt;Stray Dog of Anime: The Films of Mamoru Oshii.&lt;/i&gt; New York: Palgrave Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt; which is based on an episode of [[Rumiko Takahashi]]'s manga ''[[Urusei Yatsura]]'' (1978-1987) that depicts the baku as a tapir.&lt;ref&gt;Takahashi Rumiko 1995 ''Waking to a nightmare.'' In: ''The Return of Lum: Urusei Yatsura''. San Francisco: Viz. Pp. 141-156.&lt;/ref&gt; Tapir baku appear in [[Digimon]], which features a character called [[Bakumon]] or [[Tapirmon]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://digimon.net/cat-digimon-dictionary/06-ha/bakumon/index.html ''Digimon Dictionary'': Bakumon]&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Haruhiko Mikimoto]]'s manga ''[[Marionette Generation]]'' (2001, original 1990).&lt;ref&gt;Mikimoto Haruhiko 2001 (original 1990) ''A Profile of the Heart''. In: ''Marionette Generation, Volume 1'', San Francisco: Viz Communications. pages 159-178.&lt;/ref&gt; However, not all modern baku/yumekui are tapirs (&quot;yumekui&quot; means &quot;dream-eater&quot;). In Satoshi Kon’s 2007 animated film “[[Paprika (2006 film)|Paprika]],” Paprika, a young woman who is kami of the Dreamtime, is a baku/yumekui who devours a dream-villain at the film’s climax.&lt;ref&gt;Kon Satoshi 2007 ''Paprika''. Tokyo: Sony Pictures. ASIN B000O58V8O.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Perper, Timothy and Martha Cornog. 2009 &quot;Psychoanalytic Cyberpunk Midsummer-Night’s Dreamtime: Kon Satoshi’s &lt;i&gt;Paprika&lt;/i&gt;.&quot; Mechademia: An Annual Forum for Anime, Manga and the Fan Arts, 4:326-329.&lt;/ref&gt; Hakase Mizuki's 2007 manga &lt;i&gt;Ba_ku&lt;/i&gt; (''sic'') and Shin Mashiba's 2008 manga ''[[Nightmare Inspector]]: [[Yumekui Kenbun]]'' are also about baku/yumekui who are not tapirs.&lt;ref&gt;Hakase Mizuki 2007 ''Ba_ku.'' Los Angeles, CA: TokyoPop. (The underscore is correct; it's in the original title.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mashiba, Shin 2008 ''Nightmare Inspector: Yumekui Kenbun.'' San Francisco: Viz Media. ISBN 978-1-4215-1758-2.&lt;/ref&gt; Dream-eating, tapir-shaped baku have also entered non-Japanese popular culture. The picture book &quot;The Dream Eater&quot; by Christian Garrison tells the story of a young boy, Yukio, who meets a baku and brings it to his village &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Dream Eater |last=Garrison |first=Christian |year=1978 |publisher=Bradbury Press |location=Scarsdale, NY |isbn=0-87888-134-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.  A non-Japanese video game featuring a dream-eating tapir also exists (see external link).

'''Edward Teach''' (c. 1680 – 22&amp;nbsp;November 1718), better known as '''Blackbeard''', was a notorious English [[Piracy|pirate]] who operated around the [[West Indies]] and the eastern coast of the [[European colonization of the Americas|American colonies]].

Teach was most likely born in [[Bristol]], although little is known about his early life.  In 1716 he joined the crew of [[Benjamin Hornigold]], a pirate who operated from the [[Caribbean]] island of [[New Providence]].  He quickly acquired his own ship, ''[[Queen Anne's Revenge]]'', and from 1717 to 1718 became a renowned pirate.  His [[cognomen]], Blackbeard, was derived from his thick black beard and fearsome appearance; he was reported to have tied lit fuses under his hat to frighten his enemies.

After parting company with Hornigold, Teach formed an alliance of pirates and with his cohort blockaded the port of [[Charleston, South Carolina]].  He successfully ransomed its inhabitants and then soon after, ran his ship aground on a sandbar near Beaufort, North Carolina.  Teach accepted a royal pardon but was soon back at sea, where he attracted the attention of the [[Governor of Virginia]], [[Alexander Spotswood]].  Spotswood arranged for a party of soldiers and sailors to find and capture the pirate, which they did on 22&amp;nbsp;November 1718.  During a ferocious battle, Teach was killed by a small force of sailors led by Lieutenant [[Robert Maynard]].

A shrewd and calculating leader, Teach avoided the use of force, relying instead on his fearsome image to elicit the response he desired from those he robbed.  Contrary to the modern-day picture of the traditional tyrannical pirate, he commanded his vessels with the permission of their crews and there are no known accounts of his ever having harmed or murdered those he held captive.  He was romanticised after his death, and became the inspiration for a number of pirate-themed works of fiction across a range of genres.

==Early life==
Little is known about Blackbeard's early life.  It is commonly believed that at the time of his death he was between 35 and 40, and thus born in about 1680.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Perry|2006|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Konstam&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Konstam|2007|pp=10–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In contemporary records his name is most often given as Blackbeard, Edward Thatch, or Edward Teach, and it is the latter which today is most often used, but several spellings of his surname exist—Thatch, Thach, Thache, Thack, Tack, Thatche, and Theach.  One early claim was that his surname was Drummond, but the lack of any supporting documentation makes this unlikely.  It was the custom of pirates to use fictitious surnames while engaging in the business of piracy, so as not to tarnish the family name, and Teach's real name will likely never be known.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lee|1974|pp=3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ONDB-Blackbeard&quot;&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/27097|title=Teach, Edward &lt;nowiki&gt;[Blackbeard]&lt;/nowiki&gt; (d. 1718) {{subscription}}|last=Wood|first=Peter H|year=2004|work=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=2009-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 17th-century rise of Britain's [[American colonies]] and the rapid 18th-century expansion of the [[Atlantic slave trade]] had made [[Bristol]] an important international sea port, and Teach was most likely raised in what was the second-largest city in England.  Teach could almost certainly read and write; he communicated with merchants and on his death had in his possession a letter addressed to him by the Chief Justice and Secretary of the [[Province of Carolina]], Tobias Knight.  The author Robert Lee speculated that Teach may therefore have been born into a respectable, wealthy family.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lee|1974|pp=4–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Teach may have arrived in the Caribbean in the last years of the 17th century, on a merchant vessel (possibly a [[slave ship]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Konstam|2007|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 18th-century author [[Captain Charles Johnson|Charles Johnson]] claimed that Teach was for some time a sailor operating from [[Jamaica]] on privateer ships during [[Queen Anne's War]], and that &quot;he had often distinguished himself for his uncommon boldness and personal courage&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnson 1724 70&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Johnson|1724|p=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At what point during the war Teach joined the fighting is, like most of his life before he became a pirate, unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lee|1974|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Providence==
With its history of colonialism, trade and piracy, the [[West Indies]] was the setting for a great many maritime incidents during the 17th and 18th centuries.  The privateer-turned-pirate [[Henry Jennings]] and his followers had early in the 18th century decided to use the then empty island of [[New Providence]] as a base for their operations; the island was within easy reach of the [[Florida Strait]] and its busy shipping lanes filled with European vessels going to and from Europe.  New Providence's harbour could easily accommodate hundreds of ships, and was too shallow for the [[Royal Navy]]'s larger vessels to navigate.  The island then was not the popular tourist destination it later became; the author George Woodbury described it as &quot;no city of homes; it was a place of temporary sojourn and refreshment for a literally floating population,&quot; continuing, &quot;The only permanent residents were the piratical camp followers, the traders, and the hangers-on; all others were transient.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Woodbury|1951|pp=71–72}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Law and order were unheard of; in New Providence the pirates found a welcome respite.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lee|1974|pp=9–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Teach was one of those who came to enjoy the island's benefits.  Probably shortly after the signing of the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] he moved there from [[Jamaica]], and along with most of those who had been [[privateer]]s during the war became involved in piracy.  Possibly about 1716, Teach joined the crew of Captain [[Benjamin Hornigold]], a renowned pirate who operated from New Providence's safe waters.  In 1716 he placed Teach in charge of a [[sloop]] he had taken as a prize.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lee|1974|pp=11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In early 1717, Hornigold and Teach, each captaining a sloop, set out for the mainland.  They captured a boat carrying 120&amp;nbsp;barrels of flour out of [[Havana]], and shortly thereafter took 100&amp;nbsp;barrels of wine from a sloop from [[Bermuda]].  A few days later they stopped a vessel sailing from [[Madeira]] to [[Charleston, South Carolina]].  Teach and his quartermaster, William Howard,{{#tag:ref|Benjamin Hornigold may at this time have already parted company with Teach and his two vessels.  If this was the case, William Howard would have been left in command of Teach's other sloop.|group=&quot;nb&quot;}} may at this time have been struggling to control their crews.  By then they had probably developed a taste for [[Madeira wine]], and on 29&amp;nbsp;September near [[Cape Charles, Virginia|Cape Charles]] all they took from the ''Betty'' of Virginia was her cargo of Madeira, before they [[scuttling|scuttled]] her with the remaining cargo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Konstam|2007|pp=68–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was during this cruise with Hornigold that the earliest known report of Teach was made—recorded as a pirate in his own right, and in command of a large crew.  In a report made by a Captain Mathew Munthe on an anti-piracy patrol for North Carolina, &quot;Thatch&quot; was described as operating &quot;a sloop 6 gunns [sic] and about 70 men&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Konstam|2007|p=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In September Teach and Hornigold encountered [[Stede Bonnet]].  A landowner and military officer from a wealthy family, he had turned to piracy earlier that year but his crew of about 70&amp;nbsp;were reportedly dissatisfied with his command.  With Bonnet's permission, Teach took control of his ship ''Revenge''.  The pirate flotilla now consisted of three ships; Teach on ''Revenge'', accompanied by his old sloop, and Hornigold's ''Ranger''.  By October, another vessel had been captured and added to the small fleet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Konstam|2007|pp=78–79}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The sloops ''Robert'' of [[Philadelphia]] and ''Good Intent'' of [[Dublin]] were stopped on 22&amp;nbsp;October 1717, and their cargo holds emptied.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lee|1974|pp=13–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a former British privateer, Hornigold attacked only his former enemies.  For his crew, the sight of British vessels filled with valuable cargo passing by unharmed became too much, and at some point toward the end of 1717 he was demoted.  Whether Teach had any involvement in this decision is unknown,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Konstam|2007|pp=66–67}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Hornigold quickly retired from piracy.  He took ''Ranger'' and one of the sloops, leaving Teach with ''Revenge'' and the remaining sloop.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Konstam|2007|p=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The two never met again, and with many other occupants of New Providence Hornigold accepted the King's pardon from [[Woodes Rogers]] in June the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Woodbury|1951|p=155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28&amp;nbsp;November Teach's two ships attacked a French merchant vessel off the coast of [[Saint Vincent (island)|Saint Vincent]].  They each fired a [[broadside]] across its bulwarks, killing several of its crew, and forcing its captain to surrender.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lee|1974|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ship turned out to be ''La Concorde'' of [[Saint-Malo]], a large French guineaman carrying a cargo of slaves.  Teach and his crews sailed the vessel south along [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]], to [[Bequia]], where they disembarked her crew and cargo, and converted the ship for their own use.  The smaller of Teach's two sloops was left for the crew of ''La Concorde'', who renamed her ''Mauvaise Rencontre'' (Bad Meeting) and sailed for Martinique.  Teach may have recruited some of the slaves, but the remainder were left on the island and were later recaptured by the returning crew of ''Mauvaise Recontre''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Konstam|2007|pp=81–88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Teach immediately renamed ''La Concorde'' as ''[[Queen Anne's Revenge]]'' and equipped her with 40&amp;nbsp;guns.  In late November he attacked the ''Great Allen'', near Saint Vincent.  Teach forced the large and well-armed merchant ship to surrender after a lengthy engagement.  He ordered the ''Great Allen'' to move closer to the shore, disembarked her crew and emptied her cargo holds.  The ship was then burned and sunk.  The incident was chronicled in the ''Boston News Letter'', which described Teach as in command of a &quot;French ship of 32&amp;nbsp;Guns, a Briganteen of 10&amp;nbsp;guns and a Sloop of 12&amp;nbsp;guns.&quot;  When or where Teach collected the ten gun Briganteen is unknown, but by this time it is estimated he was in command of at least 150&amp;nbsp;men, split between three vessels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lee|1974|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Konstam|2007|p=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5&amp;nbsp;December 1717 Teach stopped the merchant sloop ''Margaret'' off the coast of Crab Island, near [[Anguilla]].  Captain Henry Bostock and his crew remained Teach's prisoners for about eight hours, and were forced to watch as their sloop was ransacked.  Bostock, who had been held unharmed aboard ''Queen Anne's Revenge'', was returned to ''Margaret'' and was allowed to leave with his crew.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Konstam|2007|pp=154–155}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He returned to his base of operations on [[Saint Christopher Island]] and reported the matter to Governor Walter Hamilton, who requested that he sign an [[affidavit]] explaining the encounter.  Bostock's deposition details Teach's command of two vessels: a sloop and a large French guineaman, Dutch-built, with 36&amp;nbsp;cannon and a crew of 300&amp;nbsp;men.  The captain believed that the larger ship carried valuable gold dust, silver plate, and &quot;a very fine cup&quot; supposedly taken from the commander of ''Great Allen''.{{#tag:ref|Konstam (2007) considers this unlikely and that the pirates were almost certainly &quot;teasing the captive with tall stories.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Konstam|2007|pp=90–91}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=&quot;nb&quot;}}  Teach's crew informed Bostock that they had destroyed several other vessels and that they intended to sail to [[Hispaniola]] and lie in wait for an expected Spanish armada, supposedly laden with money to pay the garrisons.  Teach questioned Bostock about the movements of local ships, but seemed unsurprised when Bostock told him of an expected royal pardon from London for all pirates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lee|1974|pp=27–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote box |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center | quote = So our Heroe, Captain ''Teach'', assumed the Cognomen of ''Black-beard'', from that large Quantity of Hair, which, like a frightful Meteor, covered his whole Face, and frightened ''America'' more than any Comet that has appeared there a long Time.

Bostock's deposition describes Teach as a &quot;tall spare man with a very black beard which he wore very long&quot;.  This provides the first recorded account of Teach's appearance and is the source of his cognomen, Blackbeard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Konstam|2007|p=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Later descriptions mention that his thick black beard was braided into pigtails, sometimes tied in with small coloured ribbons.  Johnson (1724) described Teach as &quot;such a figure that imagination cannot form an idea of a fury from hell to look more frightful.&quot;  Whether Johnson's description of Teach was entirely truthful or embellished is unclear, but it seems likely that Teach understood the value of appearances; better to strike fear into the heart of one's enemies, than rely on bluster alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Konstam|2007|p=155}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Teach was tall, with broad shoulders.  He wore knee-length boots and dark clothing, topped with a wide hat and sometimes a long coat of brightly-coloured silk or velvet.  Johnson also described Teach in times of battle as wearing &quot;a sling over his shoulders, with three brace of pistols, hanging in holsters like bandoliers; and stuck lighted matches under his hat&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnsonp87&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Johnson|1724|p=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|Lee (1974) describes these matches as &quot;fuses made of hemp cord about the thickness of a pencil and dipped in a solution of saltpeter and lime water.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lee|1974|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=&quot;nb&quot;}} the latter apparently to emphasise the fearsome appearance he wished to present to his enemies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnsonp57&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Johnson|1724|p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lee|1974|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite his ferocious reputation, there are no verified accounts of his ever having murdered or harmed those he held captive.{{#tag:ref|For Teach, at least, this policy paid off.  According to historian Angus Konstam, until Teach's final battle, he had not so much as killed a single man.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Konstam|2007|p=157}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to economist Peter Leeson at the University of Chicago, he apparently did not need to.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Leeson | first = Peter T. | title = Pirational Choice: The Economics of Infamous Pirate Practices | url = http://www.peterleeson.com/Papers.html | page = 21 | accessdate = 21&amp;nbsp;April 2010 | year = 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=&quot;nb&quot;}}  Teach may also have used other aliases; on 30&amp;nbsp;November, the ''Monserrat Merchant'' encountered two ships and a sloop, commanded by a Captain Kentish and Captain Edwards (the latter a known alias of Stede Bonnet).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Konstam|2007|pp=88–89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Enlargement of Teach's fleet===
Teach's movements from late 1717 to early 1718 are not known.  He and Bonnet were probably responsible for an attack off [[Saint Eustatius]] in December 1717.  Henry Bostock claimed to have heard the pirates say they would head toward the Spanish-controlled [[Samaná Bay]] in [[Hispaniola]], but a cursory search revealed no pirate activity.  Captain Hume of [[HMS Scarborough|HMS ''Scarborough'']] reported on 6&amp;nbsp;February that a &quot;Pyrate Ship of 36&amp;nbsp;Guns and 250&amp;nbsp;men, and a Sloop of 10&amp;nbsp;Guns and 100&amp;nbsp;men were Said to be Cruizing amongst the Leeward Islands&quot;.  Hume reinforced his crew with [[musket]]-armed soldiers and joined up with [[HMS Seaford|HMS ''Seaford'']] to track the two ships, to no avail.  They did however discern that the two ships had sunk a French vessel off [[Saint Kitts|St Christopher Island]], and reported also that they had last been seen &quot;gone down the North side of Hispaniola&quot;.  Although no confirmation exists that these two ships were controlled by Teach and Bonnet, author Angus Konstam believes it very likely they were.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Konstam|2007|pp=124–126}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

&lt;!-- Teach may have accepted a royal pardon in January 1718.{{#tag:ref|Owing to the use of the [[Julian Calendar]] by England, January 1717 would, after 1752, be written as January 1718.  All dates in this article are presented in the old-style calendar.|group=&quot;nb&quot;}}  Pardons were often made when England was on the verge of war; the services of pirates were a valuable commodity at such times.  Teach may have understood this and surrendered to a pardon of 5&amp;nbsp;September 1717.  The proclamation offered rewards to those persons who captured pirates who refused to surrender, covered incidences of murder committed during acts of piracy and allowed those who had suffered the theft of their property the right to recover their goods—but only through legal channels.  Teach therefore would have been under no obligation to surrender his loot to the Crown.  According to Lee (1974), if Teach did surrender, ''Queen Anne's Revenge'' would likely have been anchored at [[Ocracoke Inlet]], from which place he would have travelled to [[Bath, North Carolina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lee|1974|pp=28–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;
In March 1718, while taking on water at [[Turneffe Island]] east of [[Belize]], both ships spotted ''Adventure'' (a sloop from Jamaica) making for the harbour.  The sloop was quickly stopped and its captain, David Harriot, invited to join the pirates.  Harriot and his crew agreed and Teach sent over a crew to run ''Adventure''.  They sailed for the Bay of Honduras, where they added another ship and four sloops to their flotilla.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lee|1974|pp=30–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Konstam|2007|pp=127–128}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 9&amp;nbsp;April Teach's enlarged fleet of ships looted and burnt ''Protestant Caesar''.  His fleet then sailed to [[Grand Cayman]] where they captured a &quot;small turtler&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lee|1974|pp=36–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Teach probably sailed toward [[Havana]], where he may have captured a small Spanish vessel that had left the Cuban port.  They then sailed to the wrecks of the [[1715 Treasure Fleet|1715 Spanish fleet]], off the western coast of [[Florida]].  There he disembarked the crew of the captured Spanish sloop, before proceeding north to the port of [[Charleston, South Carolina]], attacking three vessels along the way.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Konstam|2007|p=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Blockade of Charleston===
Late in May 1718 Teach's flotilla of ships blockaded the port of [[Charleston, South Carolina]].  By then he had awarded himself the rank of [[Commodore (rank)|Commodore]] and was at the height of his power.  All vessels entering or leaving the port were stopped.  Charleston (known then as Charles Town) had no [[guard ship]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Konstam|2007|p=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its [[pilot boat]] was the first to be captured.  Over the next five or six days about nine vessels were stopped and ransacked as they attempted to sail past [[Charleston Bar]], where Teach's fleet was anchored.  One such ship, headed for London with a group of prominent Charleston citizens which included Samuel Wragg (a member of the Council of the Province of Carolina), was the ''Crowley''.  Its passengers were questioned about the vessels still in port and then locked below decks for about half a day.  Teach informed the prisoners that his fleet required medical supplies from the colonial government of South Carolina, and that if none were forthcoming, all prisoners would be executed, their heads sent to the Governor and all captured ships burnt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lee|1974|pp=39–42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wragg agreed to Teach's demands.  A Mr. Marks and two pirates were given two days to collect the drugs.  Teach moved his fleet, and the captured ships, within about five or six [[League (unit)|leagues]] from land.  Three days later a messenger, sent by Marks, returned to the fleet; Marks's boat had capsized and delayed their arrival in Charleston.  Teach granted a reprieve of two days, but still the party did not return.  Teach then called a meeting of his fellow sailors and moved eight ships were into the harbour.  General panic within the town ensued before Marks's small boat finally approached the fleet.  He had presented the pirates' demands to the Governor and the drugs were quickly gathered.  Marks's escort had not been so easy to find; they had been busy drinking with friends and were finally discovered, drunk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lee|1974|pp=42–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Teach kept to his side of the bargain and released the captured ships and his prisoners—albeit relieved of their valuables, including the fine clothing some had worn.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lee|1974|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Beaufort Inlet===
Whilst at Charleston, Teach had learnt that [[Woodes Rogers]] had left England with several [[Man-of-war|men-of-war]], with orders to purge the West Indies of pirates. Teach's flotilla of ships sailed northward along the Atlantic coast and into [[Topsail Inlet]] (commonly known as Beaufort Inlet), on the coast of North Carolina, to [[Careening|careen]] the ships for the purpose of scraping their hulls. ''Queen Anne's Revenge'' ran aground on a sandbar, cracking her [[main-mast]] and severely damaging many of her timbers. Teach then ordered several sloops to throw ropes across the flagship in an attempt to free her from the obstruction. One of the sloops, commanded by Israel Hands of ''Adventure'', also ran aground; both vessels appeared to be damaged beyond repair,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lee|1974|pp=50–51}}&lt;/ref&gt; leaving only ''Revenge'' and the captured Spanish sloop.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Konstam|2007|p=183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Teach had at some stage learnt of the offer of a royal pardon and probably confided in Bonnet that he intended to accept it.  The pardon was open to all pirates who surrendered on or before 5&amp;nbsp;September 1718, but contained a caveat which stipulated that immunity was offered only against crimes committed before 5&amp;nbsp;January.  Although in theory this left Bonnet and Teach at risk of hanging for their actions at Charleston Bar, most authorities could waive such conditions.  Teach thought that Governor [[Charles Eden]] was a man he could trust, but to make sure he waited to see what would happen to another captain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Konstam|2007|pp=183–185}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bonnet left immediately for [[Bath, North Carolina|Bath Town]] on a small sailing boat{{#tag:ref|Possibly a longboat from ''Queen Anne's Revenge''|group=&quot;nb&quot;}} where he surrendered to Governor Eden and received his pardon.  He then travelled back to Beaufort Inlet to collect the ''Revenge'' and the remainder of his crew, intending to sail to [[Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands|Saint Thomas Island]] where he would receive his commission.  Unfortunately for him, Teach had stripped the vessel of all its valuables and provisions and marooned its crew; Bonnet set out for revenge, but was unable to find him.  He and his crew returned to piracy and were captured on 27&amp;nbsp;September 1718 at the mouth of the [[Cape Fear River]].  All but four of those caught were later tried and hanged in Charleston.  The captured ''Revenge'' was later included in a fleet of ships commanded by the Governor of South Carolina, which made a ferocious attack on a group of pirates near the entrance to Charleston Harbour, resulting in the execution of 49&amp;nbsp;pirates inside a month.  Their bodies were hung in [[gibbet]]s near [[Battery Park (Charleston)|White Point]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lee|1974|pp=52–54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The author Robert Lee surmised that Teach and Hands ran both ships aground on purpose, to reduce the crew complement of the fleet and therefore increase their share of the spoils.  During the trial of Bonnet's crew ''Revenge''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s [[boatswain]] Ignatius Pell testified that &quot;the ship was run ashore and lost, which Thatch [Teach] caused to be done.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cobbett|Howell|Howell|1816|p=1249}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lee also considers it plausible that Teach let Bonnet in on his plan, which was to accept a pardon from Governor Eden.  He suggested Bonnet do the same and to consider taking a privateer's commission from England in prospect of a threatened war between the [[Quadruple Alliance|Quadruple Alliance of 1718]] and [[Spain]].  Teach offered Bonnet the return of his ship, ''Revenge''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lee|1974|pp=51–52}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Konstam (2007) proposes a similar idea, explaining that Teach began to see ''Queen Anne's Revenge'' as something of a liability; while anchored, news of a pirate fleet would be sent to neighbouring towns and colonies, and any vessels nearby would delay sailing.  It was prudent therefore for Teach not to linger for too long, although wrecking the ship was a somewhat extreme measure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Konstam|2007|pp=150,&amp;nbsp;167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pardon===
[[File:Ocracoke inlet north carolina 1775.jpg|right|thumb|300px|A map of the area around [[Ocracoke Inlet]], 1775]]
Before sailing northward on his remaining sloop to [[Ocracoke Inlet]], Teach marooned about 25&amp;nbsp;men (presumably they had guessed their captain's plans and had protested; Bonnet rescued them two days later)&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Konstam|2007|p=187}}&lt;/ref&gt; on a small sandy island about a league from the mainland.  He continued on to Bath, where in June 1718—only days after Bonnet had departed with his pardon—he and his much-reduced crew received their pardon from Governor Eden.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lee|1974|pp=52–53,&amp;nbsp;56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Teach settled in Bath, on the eastern side of Bath Creek at Plum Point, near the home of Eden.  During July and August he travelled between his base in the town and his sloop off Ocracoke.  Johnson's account stated that he married the daughter of a local plantation owner, although his is the only known evidence for this.  Eden gave Teach permission to sail to St Thomas to seek a commission as a privateer (a useful way of removing bored and troublesome pirates from the small settlement), and Teach was given official title to his remaining sloop, which he renamed ''Adventure''.  By the end of August, Teach had returned to piracy and in the same month the Governor of Pennsylvania issued a warrant for his arrest, but by this time Teach was probably operating in [[Delaware Bay]], some distance from the colony.  Teach then took two French ships leaving the Caribbean, moved one crew across to the other, and took the remaining ship back to Ocracoke.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Konstam|2007|pp=198–202}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In September 1718 he told Eden that he had found the French ship at sea, deserted.  A [[Vice admiralty court|Vice Admiralty Court]] was quickly convened, presided over by Tobias Knight and the [[Collector of Customs]].  The ship was judged as a derelict found at sea, 20&amp;nbsp;[[hogshead]]s of sugar were awarded to Knight, and sixty&amp;nbsp;to Eden; Teach and his crew were given the rest of the boat's cargo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lee|1974|p=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ocracoke Inlet was Teach's favourite anchorage.  It was a perfect location from which to view ships travelling between the settlements of northeast Carolina, and it was from this vantage point that Teach first spotted the approaching ship of another English pirate, [[Charles Vane]].  Vane had rejected the pardon brought by Woodes Rogers and escaped the men-of-war the English Captain brought with him to [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]], on 26&amp;nbsp;July 1718.  He had also been pursued by Benjamin Hornigold (Teach's old commander, now turned pirate-hunter).  The two captains spent several nights on the southern tip of Ocracoke Island, accompanied by such notorious figures as Israel Hands, Robert Deal and [[Calico Jack]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lee|1974|pp=85,&amp;nbsp;88–90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alexander Spotswood===
News of Teach and Vane's impromptu party spread throughout the neighbouring colonies, worrying the Governor of Pennsylvania enough to send out two sloops to capture the pirates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Konstam|2007|pp=204–205}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They were unsuccessful, but [[Governor of Virginia]] [[Alexander Spotswood]] was also concerned that the supposedly retired freebooter and his crew were living in nearby North Carolina.  Some of Teach's former crew had already moved to several Virginian seaport towns, and on 10&amp;nbsp;July 1718 Spotswood had issued a proclamation requiring all former pirates to make themselves known to the authorities, to give up their arms and to not travel in groups larger than three.  As head of a [[Crown colony]], Spotswood viewed the [[proprietary colony]] of North Carolina with contempt; he had little faith in the ability of the Carolinians to control the pirates, who he suspected would be back to their old ways, disrupting Virginian commerce, as soon as their money ran out.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lee|1974|pp=94–95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spotswood learnt that William Howard, the former quartermaster of ''Queen Anne's Revenge'', was in the area, and believing that he might know of Teach's whereabouts had the pirate and his two slaves arrested.  However, Spotswood had no legal authority to have pirates tried,{{#tag:ref|Colonial governors were given the power to try pirates outside England by their monarch, but that authority was said to have ended with the death of that monarch.  Spotswood did not receive a new commission, from [[George I of Great Britain|George I]], until December 1718.|group=&quot;nb&quot;}} and Howard's attorney, John Holloway, brought charges against Captain Brand of [[HMS Lyme|HMS ''Lyme'']] (where Howard was imprisoned).  He also sued on Howard's behalf for damages of £500, claiming wrongful arrest.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leepp98101&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Lee|1974|pp=98–101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spotswood's council claimed that Teach's presence was a crisis and that under a statute of [[William III of England|William III]] the governor was entitled to try Howard without a jury present.  The charges referred to several acts of piracy supposedly committed after the cut-off date of the pardon, in &quot;a sloop belonging to ye subjects of the King of Spain&quot;, but ignored the fact that they took place outside Spotswood's jurisdiction and in a vessel now legally owned.  Another charge cited two attacks, one of which was the capture of a slave ship off Charleston Bar from which one of Howard's slaves was presumed to have come.  Howard was sent to await trial before a Court of Vice-Admiralty on the charge of piracy, but Captain Brand and his colleague, Captain Gordon (of [[HMS Pearl|HMS ''Pearl'']]) refused to serve with Holloway present.{{#tag:ref|The two Captains refused as Holloway was involved in the civil action.|group=&quot;nb&quot;}}  Incensed, Holloway had no option but to stand down, and was replaced by the [[Attorney General of Virginia]], John Clayton, who Spotswood described as &quot;an honester man [than Holloway]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lee|1974|p=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Howard was found guilty and sentenced to be hanged, but was saved, however, by a commission from London which directed Spotswood to pardon all acts of piracy committed by surrendering pirates before 23&amp;nbsp;July 1718.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lee|1974|pp=104–105}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Konstam|2007|pp=205–207}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, Spotswood had obtained from Howard valuable information on Teach's whereabouts,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lee|1974|p=105}}&lt;/ref&gt; and planned to send his forces across the border into North Carolina to capture him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lee|1974|p=106}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Spotswood gained the support of two men keen to discredit North Carolina's Governor—Edward Moseley and Colonel Maurice Moore.  He also wrote to the Lords of Trade, suggesting that the Crown might benefit financially from Teach's capture.  Spotswood personally financed the operation, possibly believing that Teach had fabulous treasures hidden away.  He ordered Captains Gordon and Brand of HMS ''Pearl'' and HMS ''Lyme'' to travel overland to Bath.  Robert Maynard of HMS ''Pearl'' would take charge of two commandeered sloops and approach the town from the sea.{{#tag:ref|HMS ''Peal'' and HMS ''Lyme'' drew too much water and were therefore unable to navigate the sandbars around Ocracoke.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Konstam|2007|p=241}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=&quot;nb&quot;}}  Extra incentive for Teach's capture was given by the offer of a reward from the Assembly of Virginia, over and above any that might be received from the Crown.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lee|1974|pp=108–110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- bits about piracy legislation in here?  Lee p111 --&gt;
Lieutenant Maynard took command of the two armed sloops on 17&amp;nbsp;November.  He was given 57&amp;nbsp;men—33&amp;nbsp;from HMS ''Pearl'' and 24 from HMS ''Lyme''.  Maynard and the detachment from HMS ''Pearl'' took the larger of the two vessels and named her ''Jane''; the rest took ''Ranger'', commanded by one of Maynard's officers, a Mister Hyde.  Some of the civilian crews of the two ships remained aboard.  They sailed out from [[Kecoughtan, Virginia|Kecoughtan]], along the [[James River (Virginia)|James River]], on 17&amp;nbsp;November.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Konstam|2007|pp=242–244}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The two sloops moved slowly, to allow Brand's force time to reach Bath.  Brand set out for North Carolina six days later, arriving within three miles of Bath on 23&amp;nbsp;November.  They had with them Colonel Moore and Captain Jeremiah Vail, along with a number of other North Carolinians, to dissuade the locals from objecting to the presence of foreign soldiers.  Moore went into the town to see if Teach was there,  reporting back that he was not, but that he was expected at &quot;every minute.&quot;  Brand then went to Governor Eden's home and informed him of his purpose.  The next day, Brand sent two canoes down [[Pamlico River]] to Ocracoke Inlet, to see if Teach could be seen.  They returned two days later and reported on what had transpired.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lee|1974|pp=111–112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Last battle===
[[Robert Maynard|Lieutenant Maynard]] found the pirates anchored on the inner side of [[Ocracoke Island]], on the evening of 21&amp;nbsp;November.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Woodard|2007|pp=289–290}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He had ascertained their position from ships he had stopped along his journey, but unfamiliar with the local channels and shoals he decided to wait until the following morning to make his attack.  He stopped all traffic from entering the inlet—preventing any warning of his presence—and posted a lookout on both sloops to ensure that Teach could not escape out to sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lee|1974|p=113}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Teach, on the other side of the island, was busy entertaining guests and had not set a lookout.  With Israel Hands ashore in Bath with about 24 of ''Adventure'''s sailors, he now had a much-reduced crew.  Johnson (1724) reported that the pirate had &quot;no more than twenty-five men on board&quot; and that he &quot;gave out to all the vessels that he spoke with that he had forty&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Johnson|1724|p=81}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Thirteen white and six Negroes&quot;, was the number later reported by Brand to the Admiralty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lee|1974|p=210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At daybreak Maynard's two sloops entered the channel, just behind a small boat taking soundings for the two larger vessels.  It was quickly spotted by ''Adventure'' and fired upon as soon as it was within range of her guns.  The boat made a quick retreat to the ''Jane'', while Teach cut the ''Adventure'''s anchor cable.  As his crew hoisted the sails, the ''Adventure'' manoeuvred to point her starboard guns toward Maynard's sloops, which were now slowly closing the gap.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Konstam|2007|pp=246–248}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hyde moved ''Ranger'' to the port side of ''Jane'' and the [[Union flag]] was unfurled on each ship.  ''Adventure'' then turned toward the beach of Ocracoke Island, heading for a narrow channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lee|1974|pp=115–117}}&lt;/ref&gt;  What happened next is uncertain.  Johnson claimed that there was an exchange of small-arms fire before ''Adventure'' ran aground, while Maynard anchored and then lightened his ship to pass over the [[sandbar]].  Another version claimed that ''Jane'' and ''Ranger'' ran aground, but Maynard made no mention of this in his log.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Konstam|2007|p=252}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote box |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center | quote = ''Damn you for Villains, who are you?  And, from whence came you?''  The Lieutenant made him Answer, ''You may see by our Colours we are no Pyrates.  Black-beard'' bid him send his Boat on Board, that he might see who he was; but Mr. ''Maynard'' reply'd thus; ''I cannot spare my Boat, but I will come aboard of you as soon as I can, with my Sloop.''  Upon this, ''Black-beard'' took a Glass of Liquor and drank to him with these Words: ''Damnation seize my Soul if I give you Quarters, or take any from you''.  In Answer to which, Mr. ''Maynard'' told him, ''That he expected no Quarters from him, nor should he give him any''. | source = Reported exchange of views between Teach and Maynard&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Johnson|1724|p=82}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|No separate account of this exchange exists and Johnson's account may be considered a literary decoration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Konstam|2007|p=251}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=&quot;nb&quot;}} | align = right | width = 33%}}
What is certain though is that ''Adventure'' turned her guns on the two ships and fired.  The broadside was devastating; in an instant, Maynard had lost as much as a third of his forces.  About 20&amp;nbsp;on ''Jane'' were either wounded or killed and 9&amp;nbsp;on ''Ranger''.  Hyde was dead and his second and third officers either dead or seriously injured.  His sloop was so badly damaged that it played no further role in the attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lee|1974|p=118}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Again, contemporary accounts of what happened next are confused, but small-arms fire from ''Jane'' may have cut ''Adventure'''s [[jib sheet]], causing her to lose control and run onto the sandbar.  In the aftermath of Teach's overwhelming attack, ''Jane'' and ''Ranger'' may also have been grounded; the battle thenceforth would have become a race to see who could float their ship first.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Konstam|2007|p=253}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lieutenant had kept many of his men below deck and in anticipation of being boarded told them to prepare for close fighting.  Teach watched as the gap between the vessels closed,  and ordered his men to be ready.  The two vessels contacted one another as the ''Adventure''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s grappling hooks hit their target and several grenades, made from powder and shot-filled bottles and ignited by fuses, broke across the sloop's deck.  As the smoke cleared, Teach led his men aboard, buoyant at the sight of Maynard's apparently empty ship, his men firing at the small group formed by Maynard and his men, at the [[stern]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lee|1974|pp=119–120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Capture-of-Blackbeard.jpg|thumb|left|250px|''Capture of the Pirate, Blackbeard, 1718'', [[Jean Leon Gerome Ferris]]]]
The rest of Maynard's men then burst from the hold, shouting and firing.  The plan to surprise Teach and his crew worked; the pirates were apparently taken aback at the assault.  Teach rallied his men and the two groups fought across the deck, which was already slick with blood from those killed or injured by Teach's broadside.  Maynard and Teach fired their [[flintlock]]s at each other, before throwing them away.  Teach drew his cutlass and managed to break Maynard's sword.  Against superior training and a slight advantage in numbers, the pirates were pushed back toward the bow, allowing the ''Jane'''s crew to surround Maynard and Teach, the latter now isolated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Konstam|2007|pp=255–257}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As Maynard drew back to fire once again, Teach moved in to attack him, but was slashed across the neck by one of Maynard's men.  Badly wounded, Teach was then attacked and killed by several more of Maynard's crew.  The remaining pirates quickly surrendered.  Those left on the ''Adventure'' were captured by the crew of ''Ranger'', including one who planned to set fire to the powder room and blow up the ship.  Varying accounts exist of the battle's list of casualties; Maynard reported that 8 of his men and 12&amp;nbsp;pirates were killed.  Captain Brand reported that 10&amp;nbsp;pirates and 11&amp;nbsp;of Maynard's men were killed.  Spotswood claimed ten&amp;nbsp;pirates and ten&amp;nbsp;of the King's men dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lee|1974|pp=120–123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Blackbeard's head.jpg|thumb|right|Edward Teach's severed head hangs from Maynard's bowsprit, as pictured in Charles Elles's ''The Pirates Own Book'' (1837)]]
Maynard later examined Teach's body, noting that it had been shot no fewer than five times and cut about twenty.  He also found several items of correspondence, including a letter to the pirate from Tobias Knight.  The decapitated corpse was then thrown into the inlet and its head suspended from the [[bowsprit]] of Maynard's sloop (to enable the reward to be collected).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lee|1974|pp=122, 124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Lieutenant Maynard remained at Ocracoke for several more days, making repairs and burying the dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Konstam|2007|p=259}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Teach's loot—sugar, cocoa, [[Indigo dye|indigo]] and cotton—found &quot;in pirate sloops and ashore in a tent where the sloops lay&quot;, was sold at auction along with sugar and cotton found in Tobias Knight's barn, for £2,238.  Governor Spotswood used a portion of this to pay for the operation.  The prize money for capturing Teach was to be about £400, but was split between the crews of both HMS ''Lyme'' and HMS ''Pearl''.  Maynard thought this extremely unfair as Captain Brand and his troops had not been the ones fighting for their lives.  Maynard lost much of his support when it was discovered that he and his crew had helped themselves to about £90 of Teach's booty.  The two companies did not receive their prize money for another four years,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lee|1974|p=139}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Leepp125126&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Lee|1974|pp=125–126}}&lt;/ref&gt; and despite his bravery Maynard was not promoted; instead he faded into obscurity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Konstam|2007|pp=272–274}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The remainder of Teach's crew and former associates were found by Brand, in Bath,&lt;ref name=&quot;Leepp125126&quot;/&gt; and transported to [[Williamsburg, Virginia]], where they were jailed on charges of piracy.  Several were black and Spotswood asked his council if anything could be done about &quot;the Circumstances of these Negroes to exempt them from undergoing the same Tryal as other pirates.&quot;  This request was refused and they were tried with their comrades in Williamsburg's Capitol building, under admiralty law, on 12&amp;nbsp;March 1719.  No records of the day's proceedings remain but 14&amp;nbsp;of the 16&amp;nbsp;accused were found guilty; one was found not guilty, having proven that although he had partaken of the fight out of necessity, he had been on Teach's ship only as a guest at a drinking party the night before and was not a pirate.  Israel Hands, not present at the fight, claimed that during a drinking session he had been shot by Teach in the knee, and that he was still covered by the royal pardon.  He was found not guilty.{{#tag:ref|Konstam (2007) suggests that while imprisoned, Hands was an informant for Spotswood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Konstam|2007|p=271}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=&quot;nb&quot;}} The remaining 13&amp;nbsp;pirates were [[Hanging#Short_drop|hanged]] and left to rot in gibbets along Williamsburg's Capitol Landing Road (later known as Gallows Road).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lee|1974|pp=136–138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Governor Eden was certainly embarrassed by Spotswood's invasion of North Carolina.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lee|1974|p=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Spotswood disavowed himself of any part of the seizure.  He defended his actions, writing to [[John Carteret, 2nd Earl Granville|Lord Carteret]], a shareholder of the Province of Carolina, that he might benefit from the sale of the seized property and reminding the Earl of the number of Virginians who had died to protect his interests.  He defended the secrecy of the operation by suggesting that Eden &quot;could contribute nothing to the Success of the Design&quot;, and told Eden that his authority to capture the pirates came from the King.  Eden was heavily criticised for his involvement with Teach and was accused of being his accomplice.  By criticising Eden, Spotswood intended to bolster the legitimacy of his invasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Konstam|2007|p=233}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lee (1974) concludes that although Spotswood may have thought that the ends justified the means, he had no legal authority to invade North Carolina, to capture the pirates and to seize and auction their goods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lee|1974|pp=127–135}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Eden doubtless shared the same view.  As Spotswood had also accused Tobias Knight of being in league with Teach, Eden had Knight brought in for questioning on 4&amp;nbsp;April 1719.  Israel Hands had, weeks earlier, testified that Knight had been on board the ''Adventure'' in August 1718, shortly after Teach had brought a French ship to North Carolina as a prize.  Four pirates had testified that with Teach, they had visited Knight's home to give him presents.  This testimony and the letter found on Teach's body by Maynard appeared compelling, but Knight conducted his defence with competence.  Despite being very sick and dying, he questioned the reliability of Spotswood's witnesses.  Israel Hands he claimed had given information under duress, and the other witness, an African, was under North Carolinian law unable to offer his testimony.  The sugar, he argued, was stored at his house legally and Teach had visited him only on business in his official capacity.  The board found Knight innocent of all charges and he died later that year.&lt;!-- Can't think of a good replacement right now; &quot;middle of the year&quot; seems off, considering we're already in August; does the source narrow it down?--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lee|1974|pp=143–153}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Konstam|2007|pp=274–277}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eden was annoyed that the accusations against Knight had arisen during a trial in which he played no part.  The goods which Captain Brand had seized were officially North Carolinian property and Eden considered him a thief.  The argument raged back and forth between the colonies until 17&amp;nbsp;March 1722, when Eden died.  His will named one of Spotswood's opponents, John Holloway, a beneficiary.  In the same year Spotswood, who for years had fought his enemies in the [[House of Burgesses]] and the Council, was finally replaced by [[Hugh Drysdale]], once [[Robert Walpole]] was convinced to act.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leepp98101&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Konstam|2007|pp=276–280}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Official views on pirates were sometimes quite different from those held by contemporary authors, who often described their subjects as despicable rogues of the sea.  Privateers who became pirates were generally considered by the English government to be reserve naval forces, and were sometimes given active encouragement; as far back as 1545 [[Francis Drake]] was knighted by [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]], when he returned to England from a round-the-world expedition with plunder worth an estimated £1,500,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lee|1974|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Royal pardons were regularly issued, usually when England was on the verge of going to war.  Public sentiment was often on the side of the pirates also, many considering them to be akin to patrons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lee|1974|p=168}}&lt;/ref&gt;  University of Chicago economist Peter Leeson believes that pirates were generally shrewd businessmen, far removed from the modern romanticised view of them as murderous tyrants.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leeson&quot;/&gt;  After Woodes Rogers landed in 1718 at New Providence and succeeded in putting an end to the former pirate republic however, piracy in the West Indies fell into terminal decline.  With no easily accessible outlet to fence their stolen goods, pirates were reduced to a subsistence livelihood.  Following almost a century of naval warfare between the British, French and Spanish—during which sailors could find easy employment—lone privateers became easily outnumbered by the powerful ships employed by the [[British Empire]] to defend its merchant fleets.  The popularity of the slave trade helped bring to an end the frontier condition of the West Indies and under such circumstances, piracy could no longer flourish as it once did.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Woodbury|1951|pp=201–208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the end of this so-called [[golden age of piracy]], Teach and his exploits have become the stuff of lore, inspiring books, films and amusement park rides.  Much of what is known about him can be sourced to [[Captain Charles Johnson|Charles Johnson]]'s ''[[A General Historie of the Robberies and Murders of the Most Notorious Pyrates]]'', published in Britain in 1724.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Woodard|2007|p=325}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A recognised authority on the pirates of his time, Johnson's descriptions of such figures as [[Anne Bonny]] and [[Mary Read]] were for years required reading for those interested in the subject.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leepp89&quot;/&gt;  Readers were titillated by his stories and a second edition was quickly published, however author Angus Konstam suspects that Johnson's &quot;version of Blackbeard's life was coloured a little to make a more sensational story.&quot;{{#tag:ref|Amongst many questionable &quot;facts&quot; in Johnson's account is the encounter between Teach and [[HMS Scarborough (1711)|HMS ''Scarborough'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Konstam|2007|p=90}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Neither the log of the ''Scarborough'' nor the letters of its captain mention such an encounter; historian Colin Woodard believes that Johnson confused and conflated two actual events: the ''Scarborough''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s battle against John Martel's band and Blackbeard's close encounter with another warship, [[HMS Seaford (1697)|HMS ''Seaford'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Woodard|2007|pp=222–223}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=&quot;nb&quot;}}  ''A General Historie'' is, however, generally considered to be a reliable source.&lt;ref name=&quot;Konstamp4&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Konstam|2007|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Konstampp12&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Konstam|2007|pp=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Johnson may have been an assumed alias.  Lee (1974) considers that whoever the author was, he had some access to official correspondence as his accounts have been corroborated in personal and official dispatches.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leepp89&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Lee|1974|pp=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Konstam speculates further, suggesting that Johnson may have been the English playwright [[Charles Johnson (writer)|Charles Johnson]], the British publisher [[Charles Rivington]], or the writer [[Daniel Defoe]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Konstampp12&quot;/&gt;  In his 1951 work ''The Great Days of Piracy'', author George Woodbury wrote that Johnson is &quot;obviously a pseudonym&quot;, continuing &quot;one cannot help suspecting that he may have been a pirate himself.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Woodbury|1051|p=198}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

[[File:Pirate Flag of Blackbeard (Edward Teach).svg|left|thumb|Teach's flag depicted a skeleton spearing a heart, while toasting the devil. Flying such a flag was designed to intimidate one's enemies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Konstam|2007|pp=176–177}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Despite his infamy, Teach was not the most successful of pirates.  [[Henry Every]] captured a fortune and retired on the proceeds, and [[Bartholomew Roberts]] took an estimated five times the amount Teach stole.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Konstam|2006|p=viii}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Treasure hunters have long busied themselves searching for any trace of his rumoured hoard of gold and silver, but nothing found in the numerous sites explored along the east coast of the US has ever been connected to Teach.  Some tales suggest that pirates often killed a prisoner on the spot where they buried their loot.  Teach is no exception in these stories,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Ross | first = I. | title = Blackbeard | publisher = United States Naval Institute Proceedings | date = October 1974 | pages=72–74}}&lt;/ref&gt; but that no finds have come to light is not exceptional—buried pirate treasure is often considered a modern myth for which almost no supporting evidence exists.  In the available records about pirates there is nothing to suggest that the burial of treasure was a common practice, except in the imaginations of the writers of such fictional accounts as ''[[Treasure Island]]''.  Such hoards would necessitate a wealthy owner, and their supposed existence ignores the command structure of a pirate vessel, in which the crew often served by free suffrage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Woodbury|1951|pp=131–133}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The only pirate ever known to bury treasure was [[William Kidd]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Konstam|2007|p=285}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the only treasure so far recovered from Teach's exploits is the wreckage of the ''Queen Anne's Revenge''.  In 1997, it was found and excavated,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = In Shipwreck Linked to Pirate, State Sees a Tourism Treasure | publisher = The New York Times, hosted at nytimes.com | url = http://www.nytimes.com/1997/11/09/us/in-shipwreck-linked-to-pirate-state-sees-a-tourism-treasure.html | date = 9&amp;nbsp;November 1997 | accessdate = 21&amp;nbsp;April 2010 | page = 134}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as of 2007 more than 15,000&amp;nbsp;objects have been rescued and preserved, some of which are on display at the [[North Carolina Maritime Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Konstam|2007|p=288}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various [[Credulity|superstitious]] tales exist of Teach's ghost.  Unexplainable lights at sea are often referred to as &quot;Teach's light&quot; and some recitals claim that the notorious pirate now roams the afterlife searching for his head, for fear that his friends, and the Devil, will not recognise him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lee|1974|p=174}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A North Carolinian tale holds that Teach's skull was used as the basis for a silver drinking chalice; a local judge even claimed to have drunk from it one night in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Whedbee|1989|pp=32–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The name of Blackbeard has been attached to many local attractions, such as Charleston's Blackbeard's Cove.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Blackbeard's Cove | url = http://www.blackbeardscove.net/ | publisher = blackbeardscove.net | year = 2007 | accessdate = 21&amp;nbsp;April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blackbeard's name and persona have featured heavily in literature.  He is the main subject of Matilda Douglas's fictional 1835 work ''Blackbeard: A page from the colonial history of Philadelphia''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Douglas|1835|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[Gregory Keyes]]' fictional ''[[The Age of Unreason]]'', Blackbeard appears as the governor of a colony, and [[Tim Powers]]' 1988 novel ''[[On Stranger Tides]]'' has him forming an alliance of pirates.  Film renditions of his life include ''[[Blackbeard the Pirate]]'' (1952), ''[[Blackbeard's Ghost]]'' (1968), [[Blackbeard (2005 film)|''Blackbeard: Terror at Sea'']] (2005), and the 2006 [[Hallmark Channel]] miniseries ''[[Blackbeard (film)|Blackbeard]]''.  Parallels have also been drawn between Johnson's Blackbeard and the character of [[Captain Jack Sparrow]] in the 2003 adventure film, ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Konstam|2007|pp=284–285}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bugzilla''' is a [[World Wide Web|Web]]-based general-purpose [[bugtracker]] and [[Test automation|testing tool]] originally developed and used by the [[Mozilla]] project, and [[software license|licensed]] under the [[Mozilla Public License]]. Released as [[open source software]] by [[Netscape Communications]] in 1998, it has been adopted by a variety of organizations for use as a [[bug tracking system]] and occasionally as a data source to a [[project management software]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.projzilla.com/&lt;/ref&gt; It is used for both [[free and open source software]] and [[proprietary software|proprietary]] projects and products.

== History ==
Bugzilla was originally written by Terry Weissman in 1998 for the nascent [[Mozilla.org]] project, as an [[open source]] application to replace the in-house system then in use at Netscape Communications for tracking defects in the [[Netscape Communicator]] suite. Originally written in [[Tcl]], Terry decided to port Bugzilla to [[Perl]] before its release as part of Netscape's early open source code drops, with the hopes that more people would be able to contribute to it as Perl seemed to be a more popular language at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url = http://www.bugzilla.org/status/roadmap.html#history | title = Brief History | work = Development Roadmap | publisher = Mozilla.org | accessdate = 2006-11-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bugzilla 2.0 was the result of that port to Perl, and the first version released to the public via anonymous [[Concurrent Versions System|CVS]]. In April 2000, Weissman handed off control of the Bugzilla project to Tara Hernandez. Under Tara's leadership, some of the regular contributors were coerced into taking more responsibility, and Bugzilla development became more community-driven. In July 2001, facing distraction from her other responsibilities in Netscape, Tara handed off control to [[Dave Miller (software developer)|Dave Miller]], who was still in charge {{as of|2007|lc=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;bugzilla-dev-profiles&quot;&gt;{{ cite web | url = http://www.bugzilla.org/developers/profiles.html | title = Developer Profiles | work = Bugzilla Website | publisher = Mozilla.org | accessdate = 2007-02-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bugzilla 3.0 was released on May 10, 2007 and brought refreshed [[UI]], [[XML-RPC]] interface, custom fields and resolutions, [[mod_perl]]&lt;!-- THE UNDERSCORE IS DELIBERATE --&gt; support, shared saved searches, improved [[UTF-8]] support and others.

Bugzilla 4.0 was released on February 15, 2011.

&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web |url = http://www.bugzilla.org/releases/ |title = Release Dates |work=Release Information |publisher=Mozilla.org |accessdate=2011-03-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Requirements ==
Bugzilla's [[system requirements]] include:

* A compatible [[database management system]]
* A suitable release of [[Perl]] 5
* An assortment of Perl modules
* A compatible [[web server]]
* A suitable [[mail transfer agent]], or any [[SMTP]] server

Currently supported database systems are [[MySQL]], [[PostgreSQL]], and [[Oracle Database|Oracle]]. Bugzilla is usually installed on [[Linux]] and runs using the [[Apache HTTP Server]], but [[Microsoft Internet Information Services]] or any web server that supports [[Common Gateway Interface|CGI]] can be used. Bugzilla's installation process is [[command line]] driven and runs through a series of stages where system requirements and software capabilities are checked.

== Design ==
[[Image:Bugzilla Lifecycle color-aqua.svg|thumb|270px|The lifecycle of a Bugzilla bug]]

While the potential exists in the code to turn Bugzilla into a technical support ticket system, task management tool, or project management tool, Bugzilla's developers have chosen to focus on the task of designing a system to track software defects. Mandated design requirements include:&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url = http://www.bugzilla.org/status/roadmap.html#design | title = Design Principles | work = Development Roadmap | publisher = Mozilla.org | accessdate = 2006-11-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The ability to run on freely available, open source tools. While Bugzilla development includes work to support commercial databases, tools, and operating systems, this is not intended to come at the expense of open source ones.
* The maintenance of speed and efficiency at all costs. One of Bugzilla's major attractions to developers is its lightweight implementation and speed, so calls into the database are minimized whenever possible, data fetching is kept as light as possible, and generation of heavy [[HTML]] is avoided. Bugzilla does not support [[Lightweight markup language|markup]].&lt;ref name='Bugzilla documentation: Autolinkification'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bugzilla.org/docs/4.0/en/html/hintsandtips.html | title = Hints and Tips | accessdate = 2011-01-28 | publisher = Bugzilla | quote = Bugzilla comments are plain text [...] However, Bugzilla will automatically make hyperlinks out of certain sorts of text in comments.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Tickets. For instance, Mozilla.org and the [[MediaWiki]] project use it to track feature requests as well. Bugs can be submitted by anybody, and will be assigned to a particular developer. Various status updates for each bug are allowed, together with user notes and bug examples. In practice, most Bugzilla projects allowing the public to file bugs — such as the  Bugzilla bug database for Bugzilla itself — assign all bugs to a gatekeeper, whose job it is to assign responsibility and priority level.

== Zarro Boogs ==
By design, Bugzilla is programmed to return the string &quot;zarro boogs found&quot; instead of &quot;0 bugs found&quot; when a search for bugs returns no results.&lt;ref name=&quot;zarro&quot;&gt;{{ cite web | url = http://www.bugzilla.org/docs/3.0/html/glossary.html#gloss-zarro | title = Bugzilla Guide glossary entry for ''Zarro Boogs Found'' | work = Glossary | publisher = Bugzilla.org | accessdate = 2008-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Zarro Boogs&quot; is a facetious meta-statement about the nature of software [[software bug|debugging]]. [[Bug tracking system]]s like Bugzilla readily describe how many ''known'' bugs are outstanding. The response &quot;zarro boogs&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Coined by [[Michael Toy]] as explained by Tara Hernandez in the [[PBS]] documentary {{cite video | [[David Winton]] (Director) | title=[[Code Rush]] | time=18:21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is intended as a buggy statement itself (a misspelling of &quot;zero bugs&quot;), implying that even when no bugs have been identified, software is still likely to contain bugs that haven't yet been identified.&lt;ref name=&quot;zarro&quot; /&gt;

A '''ballad''' is a form of verse, often a [[narrative]] set to [[music]]. Ballads were particularly characteristic of [[United Kingdom|British]] and [[Ireland|Irish]] popular poetry and song from the later [[medieval]] period until the 19th century and used extensively across [[Europe]] and later the [[Americas]], [[Australia]] and [[North Africa]]. Many ballads were written and sold as single sheet [[Broadside (music)|broadsides]]. The form was often used by [[poet]]s and [[composer]]s from the 18th century onwards to produce lyrical ballads. In the later 19th century it took on the meaning of a slow form of popular love song and the term is now often used as synonymous with any love song, particularly the pop or rock ''power ballad''. 
[[File:The-Twa-Corbies.jpg|right|thumb|Illustration by [[Arthur Rackham]] of the ballad ''[[The Twa Corbies]]'']]

==Origins==
The ballad probably derives its name from medieval [[French language|French]] dance songs or &quot;ballares&quot; (from which we also get ballet), as did the alternative rival form that became the French [[Ballade]]. In theme and function they may originate from [[Scandinavia]]n and [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] traditions of storytelling that can be seen in poems such as [[Beowulf]].&lt;ref name=Houseman1952&gt;J. E. Housman, ''British Popular Ballads'' (1952, London: Ayer Publishing, 1969), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest example we have of a recognisable ballad in form in England is ‘[[Judas (ballad)|Judas]]’ in a 13th-century [[manuscript]].&lt;ref name=&quot;N. Bold, 1979 p. 5&quot;&gt;A. N. Bold, ''The Ballad'' (Routledge, 1979), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ballad form==
Most, but not all, northern and west European ballads are written in [[ballad stanza]]s or [[quatrains]] (four-line [[stanzas]]) of alternating lines of [[iambic]] (an unstressed followed by a stressed syllable) [[tetrameter]] (eight syllables) and iambic [[trimeter]] (six syllables), known as [[Common metre#Variants|ballad meter]]. Usually, only the second and fourth line of a quatrain are rhymed (in the scheme a, b, c, b), which has been taken to suggest that, originally, ballads consisted of couplets (two lines) of rhymed verse, each of 14 syllables.&lt;ref name=&quot;I. Ousby, 2006 p. 66&quot;&gt;D. Head and I. Ousby, ''The Cambridge Guide to Literature in English'' (Cambridge University Press, 2006), p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; As can be seen in this stanza from ‘[[Lord Thomas and Fair Annet]]’:

The '''horse'''| fair '''Ann'''|et '''rode'''| up'''on'''|&lt;br /&gt;
He '''amb'''|led '''like'''| the '''wind'''|,&lt;br /&gt;
With '''sil'''|ver '''he'''| was '''shod'''| be'''fore''',&lt;br /&gt;
With '''burn'''|ing '''gold'''| be'''hind'''|.&lt;ref name=Houseman1952/&gt;

However, there is considerable variation on this pattern in almost every respect, including length, number of lines and rhyming scheme, making the strict definition of a ballad extremely difficult. In southern and eastern Europe, and in countries that derive their tradition from them, ballad structure differs significantly, like Spanish ''romanceros'', which are [[octosyllabic]] and use [[Literary consonance|consonance]] rather than rhyme.&lt;ref&gt;T. A. Green, ''Folklore: An Encyclopedia of Beliefs, Customs, Tales, Music, and Art'' ([[ABC-CLIO]], 1997), p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In all traditions most ballads are narrative in nature, with a self-contained story, often concise and relying on imagery, rather than description, which can be tragic, historical, romantic or comic.&lt;ref name=&quot;I. Ousby, 2006 p. 66&quot;/&gt; Another common feature of ballads is repetition, sometimes of fourth lines in succeeding stanzas, as a [[refrain]], sometimes of third and fourth lines of a stanza and sometimes of entire stanzas.&lt;ref name=Houseman1952/&gt;

==Composition==
Scholars of ballads are often divided into two camps, the ‘communalists’ who, following the line established by the German scholar [[Johann Gottfried Herder]] (1744–1803) and the [[Brothers Grimm]], argue that ballads arose by a combined communal effort and did not have a single author, and ‘individualists’, following the thinking of English collector [[Cecil Sharp]], who assert that there was a single original author.&lt;ref name=&quot;N. Bold, 1979 p. 5&quot;/&gt; The communalist position tends to lead to the view that more recent, particularly printed broadside ballads, where we may even know the author, are a debased form of the genre. The individualists position has tended to lead to the view that later changes in the words of ballads are corruptions of an original text.&lt;ref&gt;M. Hawkins-Dady, ''Reader's Guide to Literature in English'' (Taylor &amp; Francis, 1996), p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently scholars have pointed to the interchange of oral and written forms of the ballad.&lt;ref name=&quot;A. Green, 1997 p. 353&quot;&gt;T. A. Green, ''Folklore: An Encyclopedia of Beliefs, Customs, Tales, Music, and Art'' (ABC-CLIO, 1997), p. 353.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
[[File:012-O-Waken,-Waken,-Burd-Isbel-q75-404x500.jpg|right|thumb|Illustration by [[Arthur Rackham]] to ''[[Young Bekie]].'']] European Ballads have been generally classified into three major groups: traditional, broadside and literary. In America a distinction is drawn between ballads that are versions of European, particularly British and Irish songs, and 'native American ballads', developed without reference to earlier songs. A further development was the evolution of the blues ballad, which mixed the genre with Afro-American music. For the late 19th century the music publishing industry found a market for what are often termed sentimental ballads, and these are the origin of the modern use of the term ballad to mean a slow love song.

===Traditional ballads===
{{See also|Child Ballads}}
The traditional, classical or popular (meaning of the people) ballad has been seen as originating with the wandering [[minstrels]] of late medieval Europe.&lt;ref name=Houseman1952/&gt; From the end of the 15th century we have printed [[ballads]] that suggest a rich tradition of popular music. We know from a reference in [[William Langland]]'s ''[[Piers Plowman]]'', that ballads about [[Robin Hood]] were being sung from at least the late 14th century and the oldest detailed material we have is [[Wynkyn de Worde]]'s collection of Robin Hood ballads printed about 1495.&lt;ref name=Sweers2005&gt;B. Sweers, ''Electric Folk: The Changing Face of English Traditional Music'' (Oxford University Press, 2005), p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early collections of ballads were made by [[Samuel Pepys]] (1633–1703) and in the [[Roxburghe Ballads]] collected by [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer|Robert Harley]], 1st Earl of Oxford and Mortimer (1661–1724).&lt;ref name=Sweers2005/&gt; In the 18th century there were increasing numbers of such collections, including [[Thomas D'Urfey]]'s ''Wit and Mirth: or, Pills to Purge Melancholy'' (1719–20) and Bishop [[Thomas Percy (Bishop of Dromore)|Thomas Percy]]'s ''Reliques of Ancient English Poetry'' (1765).&lt;ref name=Sweers2005/&gt; The last of these also contained some oral material and by the end of the 18th century this was becoming increasingly common, with collections including John Ritson's, ''The Bishopric Garland'' (1784), which paralleled the work of figures like [[Robert Burns]] and [[Walter Scott]] in Scotland.&lt;ref name=Sweers2005/&gt;

Key work on the traditional ballad was undertaken in the late 19th century in Denmark by [[Svend Grundtvig]] and for England and Scotland by the Harvard professor [[Francis James Child]].&lt;ref name=&quot;N. Bold, 1979 p. 5&quot;/&gt; They attempted to record and classify all the known ballads and variants in their chosen regions. Unfortunately since Child died before writing a commentary on his work it is uncertain exactly how and why he differentiated the 305 ballads printed that would be published as ''[[The English and Scottish Popular Ballads]]''.&lt;ref&gt;T. A. Green, ''Folklore: An Encyclopedia of Beliefs, Customs, Tales, Music, and Art'' (ABC-CLIO, 1997), p. 352.&lt;/ref&gt; 

There have been many different and contradictory attempts to classify traditional ballads by theme, but commonly identified types are the religious, supernatural, tragic, love ballads, historic, legendary and humorous.&lt;ref name=Houseman1952/&gt;

===Broadsides===
{{Main|Broadside (music)}}
[[File:Tragical Ballad 18th century.png|right|thumb|An 18th-century broadside ballad: ''The tragical ballad: or, the lady who fell in love with her serving-man''.]]

Broadside ballads (also known as 'roadsheet’, ‘stall’, ‘vulgar’ or ‘come all ye’ ballads) were a product of the development of cheap print from the 16th century. They were generally printed on one side of a medium to large sheet of poor quality paper. This could also be cut in half lengthways to make ‘broadslips’, or folded to make [[chapbooks]].&lt;ref&gt;G. Newman and L. E. Brown, ''Britain in the Hanoverian Age, 1714-1837: An Encyclopedia'' (Taylor &amp; Francis, 1997), pp. 39-40.&lt;/ref&gt; They were produced in huge numbers, with over 400,000 being sold in England annually by the 1660s.&lt;ref&gt;B. Capp, ‘Popular literature’, in B. Reay, ed., ''Popular Culture in Seventeenth-Century England'' (Routledge, 1985), p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt; Many were sold by travelling [[chapmen]] in city streets or at fairs.&lt;ref&gt;M. Spufford, ''Small Books and Pleasant Histories: Popular Fiction and Its Readership in Seventeenth-Century England'' (Cambridge University Press, 1985), pp. 111-128.&lt;/ref&gt; The subject matter varied from what has been defined as the traditional ballad, although many traditional ballads were printed as broadsides. Among the topics were love, religion, drinking-songs, legends, and early journalism, which included disasters, political events and signs, wonders and prodigies.&lt;ref&gt;B. Capp, ‘Popular literature’, in B. Reay, ed., ''Popular Culture in Seventeenth-Century England'' (Routledge, 1985), p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literary ballads===
Literary or lyrical ballads grew out of an increasing interest in the ballad form among social elites and intellectuals, particularly in the [[Romantic movement]] from the later 18th century. Respected literary figures like [[Robert Burns]] and [[Sir Walter Scott]] in Scotland both collected and wrote their own ballads, using the form to create an artistic product. Similarly in England [[William Wordsworth]] and [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] produced a collection of [[Lyrical Ballads]] in 1798, including Coleridge’s ‘[[The Rime of the Ancient Mariner]]’. At the same time in Germany [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]] cooperated with [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]] on a series of ballads, some of which were later set to music by [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]].&lt;ref&gt;J. R. Williams, ''The Life of Goethe'' (Blackwell Publishing, 2001), pp. 106-8.&lt;/ref&gt; Later important examples of the poetic form included Rudyard Kipling’s ‘[[Barrack Room Ballads]]’ (1892-6) and [[Oscar Wilde]]’s ‘[[Ballad of Reading Gaol]]’ (1897).&lt;ref&gt;S. Ledger, S. McCracken, ''Cultural Politics at the Fin de Siècle'' (Cambridge University Press, 1995), p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ballad operas==
{{Main|Ballad opera}}
[[Image:William Hogarth 016.jpg|thumb|200px|Painting based on ''[[The Beggar's Opera]]'', Act III Scene 2, [[William Hogarth]], c. 1728]]In the 18th century ballad operas developed as a form of [[England|English]] [[stage play|stage entertainment]], partly in opposition to the Italian domination of the London operatic scene.&lt;ref&gt;M. Lubbock, ''The Complete Book of Light Opera'' (New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts, 1962) pp. 467-68.&lt;/ref&gt; It consisted of racy and often [[Satire|satirical]] spoken (English) dialogue, interspersed with songs that are deliberately kept very short to minimize disruptions to the flow of the story. Subject matter involved the lower, often criminal, orders, and typically showed a suspension (or inversion) of the high moral values of the Italian opera of the period. The first, most important and successful was ''[[The Beggar's Opera]]'' of 1728, with a libretto by [[John Gay]] and music arranged by [[John Christopher Pepusch]], both of whom probably influenced by [[Paris]]ian vaudeville and the burlesques and musical plays of [[Thomas D'Urfey]] (1653–1723), a number of whose collected ballads they used in their work.&lt;ref&gt;F. Kidson, ''The Beggar's Opera: Its Predecessors and Successors'' (Cambridge University Press, 1969), p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; Gay produced further works in this style, including a sequel under the title ''Polly''. [[Henry Fielding]], [[Colley Cibber]], Arne, Dibdin, Arnold, Shield, Jackson of Exeter, Hook and many others produced ballad operas that enjoyed great popularity.&lt;ref&gt;M. Lubbock, ''The Complete Book of Light Opera'' (New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts, 1962), pp. 467-68.&lt;/ref&gt; Ballad opera was attempted in America and Prussia. Later it moved into a more pastoral form, like [[Isaac Bickerstaffe]]'s ''Love in a Village'' (1763) and [[William Shield|Shield’s]] ''Rosina'' (1781), using more original music that imitated, rather than reproduced, existing ballads. Although the form declined in popularity towards the end of the 18th century its influence can be seen in light operas like that of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s early works like ''[[The Sorcerer]]''.&lt;ref&gt;G. Wren, ''A Most Ingenious Paradox: The Art of Gilbert and Sullivan'' (Oxford University Press, 2006), p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 20th century, one of the most influential plays, [[Kurt Weill]] and [[Bertolt Brecht]]'s (1928) ''[[The Threepenny Opera]]'' was a reworking of ''The Beggar's Opera'', setting a similar story with the same characters, and containing much of the same satirical bite, but only using one tune from the original.&lt;ref&gt;K. Lawrence, ''Decolonizing Tradition: New Views of Twentieth-century &quot;British&quot; Literary Canons'' (University of Illinois Press, 1992), p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; The term ballad opera has also been used to describe musicals using folk music, such as ''The Martins and the Coys'' in 1944, and [[Peter Bellamy]]'s ''The Transports'' in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;A. J. Aby and P. Gruchow, ''The North Star State: A Minnesota History Reader'', (Minnesota Historical Society Press, 2002), p. 461.&lt;/ref&gt; The satiric elements of ballad opera can be seen in some modern musicals such as ''[[Chicago (musical)|Chicago]]'' and ''[[Cabaret (musical)|Cabaret]]''.&lt;ref&gt;L. Lehrman, ''Marc Blitzstein: A Bio-bibliography'' (Greenwood, 2005), p. 568.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beyond Europe==
===Native American ballads===
Native American ballads are ballads that are native to North America (not to be confused with ballads performed by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|native Americans]]).&lt;ref name=Cohen2005/&gt; Some 300 ballads sung in North America have been identified as having origins in British traditional or broadside ballads.&lt;ref name=Cohen2005&gt;N. Cohen, ''Folk Music: a Regional Exploration'' (Greenwood, 2005), pp. 14-29.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include ‘[[The Streets of Laredo]]’, which was found in Britain and Ireland as ‘The Unfortunate Rake’; however, a further 400 have been identified as originating in North America, including among the best known, ‘[[The Ballad of Davy Crockett]]' and '[[Jesse James in music|Jesse James]]'.&lt;ref name=Cohen2005/&gt; They became an increasing area of interest for scholars in the 19th century and most were recorded or catalogued by [[George Malcolm Laws]], although some have since been found to have British origins and additional songs have since been collected.&lt;ref name=Cohen2005/&gt; They are usually considered closest in form to British broadside ballads and in terms of style are largely indistinguishable, however, they demonstrate a particular concern with occupations, journalistic style and often lack the ribaldry of British broadside ballads.&lt;ref name=&quot;A. Green, 1997 p. 353&quot;/&gt;

===Blues ballads===
{{Main|Blues ballad}}
The blues ballad has been seen as a fusion of Anglo-American and Afro-American styles of music from the 19th century. Blues ballads tend to deal with active protagonists, often anti-heroes, resisting adversity and authority, but frequently lacking a strong narrative and emphasising character instead.&lt;ref name=Cohen2005/&gt; They were often accompanied by banjo and guitar which followed [[the blues]] musical format.&lt;ref name=&quot;A. Green, 1997 p. 353&quot;/&gt; The most famous blues ballads include those about [[John Henry (folklore)|John Henry]] and [[Casey Jones]].&lt;ref name=Cohen2005/&gt;

===Bush ballads===
{{Main|Bush ballad}}
[[File:The Old Bush Songs by Banio Paterson.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Cover to [[Banjo Paterson]]'s seminal 1905 collection of bush ballads, entitled ''The Old Bush Songs'']]
The ballad was taken to Australia by early settlers from Britain and Ireland and gained particular foothold in the rural [[outback]]. The rhyming songs, [[poems]] and tales written in the form of ballads often relate to the itinerant and rebellious spirit of Australia in [[The Bush]], and the authors and performers are often referred to as bush bards.&lt;ref name=&quot;abc.net.au&quot;&gt;Kerry O'Brien December 10, 2003 7:30 Report, [http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2003/s1007523.htm abc.net.au]&lt;/ref&gt; The 19th century was the golden age of bush ballads. Several collectors have catalogued the songs including [[John Meredith (folklorist)|John Meredith]] whose recording in the 1950s became the basis of the collection in the [[National Library of Australia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;abc.net.au&quot;/&gt; The songs tell personal stories of life in the wide open country of Australia. Typical subjects include mining, raising and droving cattle, [[sheep shearing]], wanderings, war stories, the [[1891 Australian shearers' strike]], class conflicts between the landless working class and the [[Squatting (pastoral)|squatters]] (landowners), and outlaws such as [[Ned Kelly]], as well as love interests and more modern fare such as [[Truck driver|trucking]].&lt;ref&gt;G. Smith, ''Singing Australian: A History of Folk and Country Music'' (Pluto Press Australia, 2005), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sentimental ballads==
Now the most commonly understood meaning of the term ballad, sentimental ballads, sometimes called &quot;tear-jerkers&quot; or &quot;drawing-room ballads&quot; owing to their popularity with the middle classes, had their origins in the early ‘[[Tin Pan Alley]]’ music industry of the later 19th century. They were generally sentimental, narrative, strophic songs published separately or as part of an [[opera]] (descendants perhaps of [[broadside (music)|broadside ballads]], but with [[sheet music|printed music]], and usually newly composed. Such songs include &quot;Little Rosewood Casket&quot; (1870), &quot;[[After the Ball (song)|After the Ball]]&quot; (1892) and &quot;[[Danny Boy]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=Cohen2005/&gt; By the [[Victorian era]], ''ballad'' had come to mean any sentimental popular song, especially so-called &quot;royalty ballads&quot;, which publishers would pay popular singers to perform in Britain and the [[United States]] in &quot;ballad concerts.&quot; Some of [[Stephen Foster]]'s songs exemplify this genre.&lt;ref&gt;Temperley (II,2).&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1920s, composers of [[Tin Pan Alley]] and [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] used ''ballad'' to signify a slow, sentimental tune or love song, often written in a fairly standardized form (see below). Jazz musicians sometimes broaden the term still further to embrace all slow-tempo pieces.&lt;ref&gt;Witmer. See also Middleton (I,4,i).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jazz, blues and traditional pop===
As new genres of music, such as [[ragtime]], [[blues]] and [[jazz]], began to emerge in the early 20th century the popularity of the genre faded, but the association with sentimentality led to the term ballad being used for a slow love song from the 1950s onwards.&lt;ref name=Cohen2005/&gt; Most [[traditional pop music|pop standard]] and jazz ballads are built from a single, introductory ''verse''; usually around 16 [[bar (music)|bars]] in length, and ending on the [[dominant (music)|dominant]]; the ''chorus'' or ''[[refrain]]'', usually it is 16 or 32 bars long, and in [[AABA form]] (though other forms such as ABAC are not uncommon). In AABA forms, the B section is usually referred to as the ''[[bridge (music)|bridge]]''; often a brief ''[[coda (music)|coda]]'', sometimes based on material from the bridge, was added as in &quot;[[Over the Rainbow]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Randel 1986, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; Other key traditional pop and jazz ballads include: &quot;[[Body and Soul (song)|Body and Soul]]&quot; by [[Johnny Green]]; &quot;[[Misty (song)|Misty]]&quot; by [[Erroll Garner]]; &quot;[[The Man I Love (song)|The Man I Love]]&quot; by [[George Gershwin]]; &quot;[[My Funny Valentine]]&quot; by [[Rodgers and Hart]], &quot;[[God Bless the Child (Billie Holiday song)|God Bless the Child]]&quot; by [[Billie Holiday]], &quot;[[Ev'ry Time We Say Goodbye]]&quot; by [[Cole Porter]], the instrumental ballad &quot;[[Naima]]&quot; by [[John Coltrane]], &quot;[[In a Sentimental Mood]]&quot; by [[Duke Ellington]] and &quot;[[Always (song)|Always]]&quot; by [[Irving Berlin]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Forte, ''The American Popular Ballad of the Golden Era, 1924-1950'' (Princeton University Press, 1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pop and rock ballads===

The most common use of the term ballad in modern [[pop music]] is for an emotional love song.&lt;ref name=Cohen2005p297&gt;N. Cohen, ''Folk Music: a Regional Exploration'' (Greenwood, 2005), p. 297.&lt;/ref&gt; When the word ''ballad'' appears in the title of a song, as for example in [[The Beatles]]'s &quot;[[The Ballad of John and Yoko]]&quot; or [[Billy Joel]]'s &quot;[[The Ballad of Billy the Kid]]&quot;, the folk-music sense is generally implied. ''Ballad'' is also sometimes applied to strophic story-songs more generally, such as [[Don McLean]]'s &quot;[[American Pie (song)|American Pie]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;D. R.

[[Simon Frith]] identifies the origins of the power ballad in the emotional singing of soul artists, particularly [[Ray Charles]] and the adaptation of this style by figures such as [[Eric Burdon]], [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]] and [[Joe Cocker]] to produce slow tempo songs often building to a loud and emotive chorus backed by drums, electric guitars and sometimes choirs.&lt;ref name=Frithpop/&gt; According to Charles Aaron, power ballads came into existence in the early 1970s, when rock stars attempted to convey profound messages to audiences.&lt;ref name=aaron&gt;{{cite book|last=Aaron|first=Charles|editors=Jonathan Lethem, Paul Bresnick|title=Da Capo Best Music Writing 2002: The Year's Finest Writing on Rock, Pop, Jazz, Country, and More|publisher=[[Da Capo Press]]|chapter=Don't Fight the Power|year=2002|isbn=0306811669, 9780306811661|page=132}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that the power ballad broke into the mainstream of American consciousness in 1976 as FM radio gave a new lease of life to earlier songs like [[Led Zeppelin]]'s &quot;[[Stairway to Heaven]]&quot; (1971), [[Aerosmith]]'s &quot;[[Dream On (Aerosmith song)|Dream On]]&quot; (1973), and [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]]'s &quot;[[Free Bird]]&quot; (1974).&lt;ref name=aaron/&gt; Other notable examples include [[Nazareth (band)|Nazareth]]'s version of &quot;[[Love Hurts]]&quot; (1975), [[Foreigner (band)|Foreigner]]'s &quot;[[I Want to Know What Love Is]]&quot;,&lt;ref name=Frithpop&gt;S.

'''Blue Öyster Cult''', often abbreviated '''BÖC''', is an American [[rock music|rock]] band, most of whose members first came together in New York in 1967 as the band ''Soft White Underbelly''. The group is well known for songs including &quot;[[(Don't Fear) The Reaper]]&quot;, &quot;[[Burnin' for You]]&quot;, &quot;[[Godzilla (song)|Godzilla]]&quot;, &quot;[[Cities on Flame with Rock and Roll]]&quot;, &quot;[[Veteran of the Psychic Wars]]&quot;, &quot;[[Astronomy (song)|Astronomy]]&quot; and &quot;[[This Ain't the Summer of Love]]&quot;. They have sold over 24 million albums worldwide – including 7 million in the US.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

==History==
The band originated as a group called ''Soft White Underbelly'' (a name the band would later occasionally use in the 1970s and 80s to play small club gigs around the U.S.) in 1967 in the vicinity of [[Stony Brook University]] on [[Long Island, New York]], at the prompting of critic and manager [[Sandy Pearlman]].&lt;ref name = &quot;ecfjhn&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Berelian |first=Essi |title=The Rough Guide to Heavy Metal |publisher=Rough Guides |isbn=1-84353-415-0 |page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pearlman wanted the group to be the American answer to [[Black Sabbath]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://classicrock.about.com/od/artistsae1/a/eric_bloom.htm |title=Interview with Eric Bloom of Blue Oyster Cult |publisher=Classicrock.about.com |date=2010-06-11 |accessdate=2010-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pearlman was very important to the band—he was able to get them [[concert|gigs]], recording contracts with [[Elektra Records|Elektra]] and [[Columbia Records|Columbia]], and he provided them with his [[poetry]] for use as lyrics for many of their songs, including &quot;Astronomy&quot;. Writer [[Richard Meltzer]] also provided the band with lyrics from their early days up through their most recent studio album. The band (with original lead vocalist [[Les Braunstein]] and bassist [[Andrew Winters]]) recorded an album's worth of material for [[Elektra Records]] in 1968. When Braunstein departed in early 1969, Elektra shelved the album.

[[Eric Bloom]] (formerly the band's acoustic engineer) replaced Braunstein, and the band continued to perform as Soft White Underbelly. However, a bad review of a 1969 Fillmore East show caused Pearlman to change the name of the band - first to [[Oaxaca]], then to the Stalk-Forrest Group. The band recorded yet another album's worth of material for Elektra, but only one single (&quot;What Is Quicksand?&quot; b/w &quot;Arthur Comics&quot;) was released (and only in a promo edition of 300 copies) on [[Elektra Records]]. (This album was eventually released, with additional outtakes, by Rhino Handmade Records as ''[[St. Cecilia: The Elektra Recordings]]'' in 2001). After a few more temporary band names, including the Santos Sisters, the band settled on Blue Öyster Cult in 1971. (see [[#Band name|&quot;band name&quot;]] section below for its origin).

New York producer and jingle writer David Lucas saw the band perform and took them into his Warehouse Recording Studio and produced a demo, with which Pearlman was able to get the renamed band another audition with [[Columbia Records]]. [[Clive Davis]] liked what he heard, and signed the band to the label. The first album was subsequently recorded on eight track at Lucas' studio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blueoystercult.com/Studio/SWbios.html#Lucas |title='David Lucas' in band-relations bio page|publisher=Official BÖC website |date= |accessdate=2011-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Black and white years===
Their debut album ''[[Blue Öyster Cult (album)|Blue Öyster Cult]]'' was released in January 1972, with a black and white cover designed by artist Bill Gawlik. The album featured the songs &quot;[[Cities on Flame with Rock and Roll]]&quot;, &quot;Stairway to the Stars,&quot; and &quot;Then Came the Last Days of May&quot;. The album sold well, and Blue Öyster Cult toured with artists such as the [[Byrds]], [[Mahavishnu Orchestra]], and [[Alice Cooper]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Perry |first=Shawn |url=http://www.vintagerock.com/ebloom_interview.aspx |title=The Eric Bloom Interview |publisher=Vintagerock.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their next album ''[[Tyranny and Mutation]]'', released in 1973, was written while the band was on tour for their first LP. It contained songs such as &quot;The Red and The Black&quot; (an ode to the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] and basically a sped-up rewrite of &quot;I'm On The Lamb&quot;, from the debut album), &quot;Hot Rails To Hell&quot;, and &quot;Baby Ice Dog&quot;, the first of the band's many collaborations with [[Patti Smith]].

The band's third album, ''[[Secret Treaties]]'' (1974) received positive reviews, featuring songs such as &quot;Career of Evil&quot; (also co-written by Patti Smith), &quot;Dominance and Submission&quot; and &quot;[[Astronomy (song)|Astronomy]]&quot;. As a result of constant touring, the band was now capable of headlining arenas.

===Commercial success===
The band's first live album ''[[On Your Feet or on Your Knees]]'' (1975) achieved greater success and went gold, and was followed up by their first platinum album, ''[[Agents of Fortune]]'' (1976). It contained the hit single &quot;[[(Don't Fear) The Reaper]]&quot;, which reached number 12 on the Billboard charts and has become a classic of the genre. Other major songs on the album were &quot;(This Ain't) The Summer of Love,&quot; &quot;E.T.I. (Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence),&quot; and &quot;The Revenge of Vera Gemini.&quot; For the tour, the band added lasers to their light show, for which they became known.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blueoystercult.com/History/history6.html|publisher=Blue Oyster Cult.com|title=The History of BÖC|accessdate=2008-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their next album, ''[[Spectres (album)|Spectres]]'' (1977), had the FM radio hit &quot;[[Godzilla (song)|Godzilla]]&quot;, but its sales were not as strong as those for the previous album.

The band then released another live album, ''[[Some Enchanted Evening (Blue Öyster Cult album)|Some Enchanted Evening]]'' (1978). Though it was intended as another double-live album in the vein of ''[[On Your Feet Or On Your Knees]]'', Columbia insisted that it be edited down to single-album length. It became Blue Öyster Cult's most popular album, eventually selling over 2 million copies.

It was followed by the studio album ''[[Mirrors (Blue Öyster Cult album)|Mirrors]]'' (1979). For ''Mirrors'', instead of working with previous producers Pearlman (who instead went on to manage [[Black Sabbath]]) and Krugman, Blue Öyster Cult chose [[Tom Werman]], who had worked with acts such as [[Cheap Trick]] and [[Ted Nugent]]. However, the resulting album sales were disappointing.

Pearlman's association with Black Sabbath was tapped for the next Blue Öyster Cult album, which resulted in Sabbath's ''[[Heaven and Hell (Black Sabbath album)|Heaven and Hell]]'' producer [[Martin Birch]] being hired for the next Blue Öyster Cult record. The result was positive, with ''[[Cultösaurus Erectus]]'' (1980) receiving good reviews. The album went to number 12 in the UK, but did not do as well in the U.S. One of the notable songs on the album was &quot;Black Blade,&quot; which was written by Bloom with lyrics by sci-fi and fantasy author [[Michael Moorcock]]. The song is a kind of retelling of Moorcock's epic [[Elric of Melniboné]]-Saga. The band also did a co-headlining tour with Black Sabbath in support of the album, calling the tour &quot;[[Black and Blue (video)|Black and Blue]]&quot;.

Birch produced the band's next album as well, ''[[Fire of Unknown Origin]]'' (1981). The biggest hit on this album was the Top 40 hit &quot;[[Burnin' for You]]&quot;, a song Dharma had written with a [[Richard Meltzer]] lyric. He had intended to use it on his 1982 solo album, ''[[Flat Out Album|Flat Out]]'', but he was convinced to use it on the Blue Öyster Cult album instead. The album went platinum, and contained other fan favorites such as &quot;Joan Crawford&quot; (inspired by the book and film [[Mommie Dearest]]) and &quot;[[Veteran of the Psychic Wars]]&quot;, another song co-written by Moorcock. Several of the songs had been written for the animated film ''[[Heavy Metal (film)|Heavy Metal]]'', but only &quot;Veteran of the Psychic Wars&quot; (which, ironically, was not written for ''[[Heavy Metal (film)|Heavy Metal]]'') was actually used in the movie. After this album, [[Albert Bouchard]] had a falling out with the others and left the band, and Rick Downey (formerly the band's lighting designer) replaced him on drums.

===Decline and fall===
After leaving the band, Albert Bouchard spent five years working on a solo album based on Sandy Pearlman's poem ''&quot;Imaginos.&quot;'' Blue Öyster Cult released a live album ''[[Extraterrestrial Live]]'', then went to the studio for the next album, with [[Bruce Fairbairn]] as producer, the 1983 release ''[[The Revölution by Night]]''. Its highest-charting single was &quot;Shooting Shark,&quot; co-written by Patti Smith, which reached number 83 on the charts. &quot;Shooting Shark&quot; also featured [[Randy Jackson]] on bass. After ''Revölution'', Rick Downey left, leaving Blue Öyster Cult without a drummer.

The band re-united with Albert Bouchard for a California tour in February 1985, infamously known as the &quot;Albert Returns&quot; Tour. This arrangement was only temporary, and caused more tensions between the band and Bouchard, as he had thought he would be staying on permanently, which was not the case. The band had only intended to use him as a last-minute fill-in until another drummer could come on board, which resulted in Bouchard's leaving after the tour. Allen Lanier also quit the band shortly thereafter, leaving the band without a keyboardist.

Blue Öyster Cult hired drummer Jimmy Wilcox and keyboardist Tommy Zvoncheck to finish the ''[[Club Ninja]]'' album, which was poorly received, with only &quot;Dancing In The Ruins&quot; -- one of several songs on the record written entirely by outside songwriters—enjoying minimal success on radio and [[MTV]]. The highlight of the album was &quot;Perfect Water&quot; written by Dharma and [[Jim Carroll]] (noted author of ''[[The Basketball Diaries]]'').

The band toured in Germany, after which bassist Joe Bouchard left, leaving only two original members, Eric Bloom and Donald Roeser—some referred to the band as &quot;Two Öyster Cult&quot; during this period. Jon Rogers was hired to replace Joe, and this version of the band finished out the 1986 tour. After the tour wound up that year, the band took a temporary break from recording and touring, its future uncertain.

===''Imaginos'' and continued touring===
[[File:Blue Öyster Cult Sweden Rock 2008.jpg|thumb|Blue Öyster Cult performing at the [[Sweden Rock Festival]], 2008.]]
When Blue Öyster Cult received an offer to tour in Greece in the early summer of 1987, the band sprang back into action. The new line-up contained founding members [[Eric Bloom]], [[Donald &quot;Buck Dharma&quot; Roeser]] and [[Allen Lanier]], with Jon Rogers returning on bass, and Ron Riddle on drums. [[Columbia Records]] was not interested in releasing the ''[[Imaginos]]'' project as an Albert Bouchard solo album, so Pearlman arranged for it to be released in 1988 by Columbia as a Blue Öyster Cult album, with some new vocal and instrumental overdubs from Bloom and Roeser. The album did not sell very well (despite a positive review in Rolling Stone magazine), and though Blue Öyster Cult did tour to promote ''Imaginos'', promotion by the label was virtually non-existent. When Columbia Records' parent company [[CBS Records]] was purchased by [[Sony]], Blue Öyster Cult were dropped from the label.

The band spent the next 11 years touring without releasing an album, though they did contribute two new songs to the ''[[Bad Channels]]'' movie soundtrack, released in 1992. Riddle quit in 1991 and was followed by a series of other drummers including
Chuck Burgi (1991–1992, 1992–1995, 1996–1997), John Miceli (1992, 1995, 2008), John O'Reilly (1995–1996) and Bobby Rondinelli (1997–2004, 2008). Jules Radino joined in 2004, and is the band's current drummer. Rogers left in 1995, and was replaced by [[Danny Miranda (bassist)|Danny Miranda]]. Miranda left in 2004 and ended up as the bassist for [[Queen + Paul Rodgers]] - and Richie Castellano replaced him.
[[File:Allenlanier.JPG|right|thumb|Blue Öyster Cult live in 2006]]
[[Allen Lanier]] retired from live performances in 2007 after not appearing with the band since late 2006. Castellano has switched to rhythm guitar and keyboards (Castellano also filled in on lead guitar and vocals for an ailing [[Buck Dharma]] in two shows in 2005), and the band has employed three &quot;guest bassists&quot; on a rotating basis: [[Danny Miranda (bassist)|Danny Miranda]], Jon Rogers and [[Rudy Sarzo]] (ex-[[Quiet Riot]], ex-[[Ozzy Osbourne]], ex-[[Whitesnake]], and ex-[[Dio (band)|Dio]]).

In December 2008, BÖC management announced that Roeser had fallen down a staircase in his [[Florida]] home and injured his shoulder. As a result, several tour dates in December 2008 and January 2009 were canceled or postponed. The band returned to touring by the fall of 2009.

===CMC/Sanctuary years===
In the late 1990s, Blue Öyster Cult secured a recording contract with CMC Records (later purchased by [[Sanctuary Records]]), and continued to tour frequently. Two studio albums were released, 1998's ''[[Heaven Forbid]]'' and ''[[Curse of the Hidden Mirror]]'' from 2001. Both albums featured songs co-written by cyberpunk/horror novelist [[John Shirley]]. Another live record, ''[[A Long Day's Night]]'' and DVD (same title), followed in 2002, both drawn from one concert in Chicago.

Blue Öyster Cult have since had a falling out with [[Sanctuary Records]], and currently have no record deal.

===Sony Legacy remasters===
In 2001, Sony/Columbia's reissue arm, [[Legacy Records]] issued expanded versions of the first four Blue Öyster Cult studio albums, including some previously unreleased demos and outtakes from album sessions, live recordings (from the Live 72 ep), and post-St. Cecilia tunes from the Stalk-Forrest Group era.

In February 2007, the Sony Legacy remaster series continued, releasing expanded versions of studio album ''[[Spectres (album)|Spectres]]'' and live album ''[[Some Enchanted Evening (Blue Öyster Cult album)|Some Enchanted Evening (album)]]'', leaving the first live album ''[[On Your Feet Or On Your Knees]]'' still without the treatment. However, the liner notes for the second round of remasters differ from the photos and in-depth analysis of the first four releases, and did not include lyrics as the earlier releases had.

==Band name==
[[File:Hook-and-cross white.svg|thumb|170px|The hook-and-cross logo]]
The name &quot;Blue Öyster Cult&quot; came from a 1960s poem written by manager [[Sandy Pearlman]]. It was part of his &quot;Imaginos&quot; poetry, later used more extensively in their 1988 album ''[[Imaginos]]''. Pearlman had also come up with the band's earlier name, &quot;Soft White Underbelly&quot;, from a phrase used by [[Winston Churchill]] in describing [[Italy]] during [[World War II]]. In Pearlman's poetry, the &quot;Blue Oyster Cult&quot; was a group of aliens who had assembled to secretly guide Earth's history. &quot;Initially, the band was not happy with the name, but settled for it, and went to work preparing to record their first release...&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;blueoystercult.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blueoystercult.com/History/history3.html |title=The History of BÖC |publisher=Blueoystercult.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview published in the U.K. music magazine Zig Zag in 1976, Pearlman told the story explaining the origin of the band's name was an anagram of 'Cully Stout Beer'.

The addition of the [[Heavy metal umlaut|umlaut]] was suggested by [[Allen Lanier]], but rock critic [[Richard Meltzer]] claims to have suggested it just after Pearlman came up with the name, reportedly &quot;because of the [[Richard Wagner|Wagnerian]] aspect of Metal.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rateyourmusic.com/lists/list_view?list_id=35734&amp;show=25&amp;start=25 |title=Why are they called Duran Duran? A guide to band name etymologies |publisher=Rate Your Music |date=1916-02-05 |accessdate=2010-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;From a linguistic viewpoint, this might be regarded as a [[Diaeresis (diacritic)|diaeresis]], rather than as an umlaut,&quot;{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}&lt;ref name=&quot;blueoystercult.com&quot;/&gt; Other bands later copied the practice of using umlauts or diacritic marks in their own band logos (see [[heavy metal umlaut]]), such as [[Motörhead]], [[Mötley Crüe]], [[Queensrÿche]], and the parody band [[Spinal Tap (band)|Spın̈al Tap]].&lt;ref name=faq&gt;{{cite web|url=http://members.aol.com/bocfaqman/boc_faq.html|title=BOC FAQ|date=2001-12-10|author=John Swartz|accessdate=2007-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hook-and-cross logo was designed by Bill Gawlik&lt;ref name=&quot;ecfjhn&quot;/&gt; in January 1972,&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blueoystercult.com/History/history4.html |title=The History of BÖC |publisher=Blueoystercult.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and appears on all of the band's albums.&lt;ref name=faq/&gt; Reports that the logo is made from three exclamation marks and a backwards question mark are false. In Greek mythology, &quot;...the hook-and-cross symbol is that of [[Cronus|Kronos (Cronus)]], the king of the Titans and father of Zeus...and is the alchemical symbol for lead (a heavy metal), one of the heaviest of metals.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dinesh.com/history_of_logos/rock_band_logos/blue_oyster_cult_logo_-_design_and_history.html |title=Blue Oyster Cult Logo - Design and History |publisher=Dinesh.com |date=2010-08-25 |accessdate=2010-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sandy Pearlman considered this, combined with the heavy and distorted guitar sound of the band and decided the description &quot;[[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]]&quot;&lt;ref&gt;The term &quot;heavy metal&quot; was first used by [[Mike Saunders]] in 1970.[http://www.headheritage.co.uk/unsung/albumofthemonth/1430]&lt;/ref&gt; would be aptly applied to Blue Öyster Cult's musical sound. In Roman mythology, the hook-and-cross symbol represents [[Planets in astrology|Saturn]], the God of agriculture and fertility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.loggia.com/myth/saturn.html |title=Mythography &amp;#124; The Roman God Saturn in Myth and Art |publisher=Loggia.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hook and cross symbol also resembles the [[sickle]], which is associated with both Kronos (Cronus) and Saturn (both the [[Saturn|planet]] and the Roman God).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wordsources.info/saturn.html |title=Saturn, Roman god of the harvest and a planet |publisher=Wordsources.info |date= |accessdate=2010-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The logo's &quot;...metaphysical, alchemical and mythological connotations, combined with its similarity to some religious symbols gave it a flair of decadence and mystery...&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

The band was billed, for the only time, as ''The'' Blue Öyster Cult on the cover and label of their second album, ''[[Tyranny And Mutation]]''.

==Legacy and influence==
{{Original research|section|date=May 2011}}
Due to their unique sound and diversity, Blue Öyster Cult has been very influential to many modern bands that span many genres, and are often viewed as important pioneers of several different styles of rock music that came to prominence in the 1980s and 1990s. Many heavy metal bands have cited them as a major influence, and bands such as [[Metallica]] and [[Iced Earth]] have covered their songs on studio recordings and during live performances. The song &quot;[[(Don't Fear) The Reaper]]&quot; has also been covered by many diverse artists, notably [[Evanescence]], [[The Goo Goo Dolls]], [[The Beautiful South]], [[Wilco]], [[Big Country]], and deceased [[singer-songwriter]] [[Elliott Smith]]. The bands [[Minutemen (band)|The Minutemen]] and [[fIREHOSE]], featuring bassist [[Mike Watt]], frequently performed versions of &quot;The Red &amp; The Black&quot; during their career.The song &quot;[[ Burnin' for You]]&quot; was covered by [[Shiny Toy Guns]] for a 2010 Lincoln MKS commercial.  They were also quite influential to several early [[punk rock]] bands. They are seen as one of the main influences by [[rock noir]] bands such as the genre originators [[Belladonna (band)|Belladonna]]. The [[Australian]] punk band [[Radio Birdman]] named their debut album ''[[Radios Appear]]'' after a Blue Öyster Cult lyric from the song &quot;Dominance and Submission&quot;. Blue Öyster Cult's song &quot;[[Godzilla]]&quot; has been covered by a wide variety of bands, including [[Racer X (band)|Racer X]], [[Fu Manchu]], [[The Smashing Pumpkins]], [[Sebastian Bach]], and more.

Blue Öyster Cult has also been an influence on many of the harder-edged, psychedelic bands in the modern [[jam band]] scene because of their intimate live shows and extended improvisations. Out of these bands, fellow New Yorkers [[moe.]] have cited Blue Öyster Cult as one of their primary influences. They have been greatly influenced by Blue Öyster Cult in their style of guitar-driven jamming, their elaborate light shows, slightly tongue-in-cheek and eclectic songwriting, and the intimate atmosphere of their live performances. moe. also frequently covers Blue Öyster Cult classics in their sets, and members of Blue Öyster Cult have appeared on-stage with the band several times in the past few years, including the 2002 [[Jammy Awards]]. A photo of the performance can be seen here.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.blueoystercult.com/Road/RoadImages/jammys.jpg&lt;/ref&gt;

The un-authored [[Allmusic]] page for stoner metal states: '&quot;[[Stoner metal]] bands updated the long, mind-bending jams and ultra-heavy riffs of bands like [[Black Sabbath]], [[Blue Cheer]], Blue Oyster Cult, and [[Hawkwind]] by filtering their psychedelia-tinged metal and acid rock through the buzzing sound of early Sub Pop-style grunge.&quot;'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=explore|id=style/d11953|pure_url=yes}} |title=allmusic |publisher=allmusic |date= |accessdate=2010-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heavy metal journalist [[Martin Popoff]] has stated that Blue Öyster Cult is one of his favorite bands. He has written a book entitled ''Blue Öyster Cult: Secrets Revealed'' about the discography. It is a compiled track-by-track analysis of the entire output of the group that uses period and recent interviews with band members and those close to the band. It is complete up to Curse of the Hidden Mirror.

Their hit single &quot;(Don't Fear) The Reaper&quot; was featured in the famous ''Saturday Night Live'' sketch, &quot;[[More cowbell]]&quot;. The original recording was produced at The Record Plant in New York and produced by David Lucas who sang background vocals with Roeser and played the now famous cowbell part. Manager Sandy Pearlman mixed the record.

'''Battery Park City''' is a 92-acre (0.4&amp;nbsp;km²) [[planned community]] at the southwestern tip of [[lower Manhattan]] in [[New York City]], [[United States]]. The land upon which it stands was created on the [[Hudson River]] using 1.2 million cubic yards (917,000 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) of soil and rocks excavated during the construction of the [[World Trade Center]] and certain other construction projects, as well as from sand dredged from New York Harbor off Staten Island.&lt;ref&gt;Howe, Arthur.
