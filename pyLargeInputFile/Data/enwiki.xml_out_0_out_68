 restitution of property and acceptance to the reconstruction assistance programmes. Combined with lacking economic opportunities in the rural areas of [[RSK|former Krajina]], the return process is highly troubled.

At the time of Croatia's application to the European Union, three EU countries were yet to ratify the Stabilization and Association Agreement: the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Netherlands]] and [[Italy]].

The new [[Ivo Sanader|Sanader]] government repeated the assurances that Croatia will fulfill the missing political obligations, and expedited the extradition of several ICTY indictees.

The European Commission replied to the answers of the questionnaire sent to Croatia on April 20, 2004 with a positive opinion. The country was finally accepted as EU candidate in July 2004. Italy and Britain ratified the Stabilization and Association Agreement shortly thereafter, while the ten EU countries that were admitted to membership that year ratified it en masse at a [[European Council|European Summit]].

In December 2004, the EU leaders announced that accession negotiations with Croatia would start on March 17, 2005 provided that Croatian government cooperates fully with the ICTY. The main issue, the flight of general [[Ante Gotovina|Gotovina]], however, remained unsolved and despite the agreement on an accession negotiation framework, the negotiations did not begin in March 2005.

On October 4, 2005 Croatia finally received green light for accession negotiations after the Chief Prosecutor of the ICTY, [[Carla Del Ponte]] officially stated that Croatia is fully cooperating with the Tribunal. This has been the main condition demanded by EU foreign ministers for accession negotiations. The ICTY called upon other southern European states to follow Croatia's good example. Thanks to the consistent position of [[Austria]] during the meeting of EU foreign ministers, a long period of instability and the questioning of the determination of the Croatian government to surrender war criminals has ended successfully. The Croatian Prime minister declared that full cooperation with the Hague Tribunal will continue.

As of 2010, the following states have not extended diplomatic recognition to Croatia:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mvpei.hr/MVP.asp?pcpid=1621 |title=MVPEI |publisher=Mvpei.hr |date= |accessdate=2010-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current events==
The main objective of the Croatian foreign policy is admittance to the European Union. It applied in 2003, and began with accession negotiations in 2005 (see also: [[Accession of Croatia to the European Union]]).

Government officials in charge of foreign policy include the [[Foreign minister|Minister of Foreign Affairs and European Integration]], currently [[Gordan Jandroković]], and the [[President of Croatia|President of the Republic]], currently [[Ivo Josipović]]. The chief EU negotiator is [[Vladimir Drobnjak]].

As of 2004, Croatia has [[diplomatic mission]]s in 124 locations around the world, including two permanent missions to the [[United Nations]].
A complete listing of Croatian [[diplomatic mission|embassies]] in foreign countries is available at &quot;[http://www.mfa.hr/MVP.asp?pcpid=1613 Diplomatic Missions and Consular Offices]&quot; at the web site of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

==Foreign support==
Croatia receives support from donor programs of:
* [[European Bank for Reconstruction and Development]] (EBRD)
* [[European Union]]
* [[International Bank for Reconstruction and Development]]
* [[International Monetary Fund]]
* [[USAID]]

Between 1991 and 2003, the EBRD had directly invested a total of 1,212,039,000 [[Euro|EUR]] into projects in Croatia.

In 1998, U.S. support to Croatia came through the Southeastern European Economic Development Program (SEED), whose funding in Croatia totaled $23.25 million. More than half of that money was used to fund programs encouraging sustainable returns of refugees and displaced persons. About one-third of the assistance was used for democratization efforts, and another 5% funded financial sector restructuring.

In 2003 USAID considered Croatia to be on a &quot;glide path for graduation&quot; along with [[Bulgaria]]. Its 2002/2003/2004 funding includes around $10 million for economic development, up to $5 million for the development of democratic institutions, about $5 million for the return of population affected by war and between 2 and 3 million dollars for the &quot;mitigation of adverse social conditions and trends&quot;. A rising amount of funding is given to cross-cutting programs in anti-[[political corruption|corruption]], slightly under one million dollars.

The European Commission has proposed to assist Croatia's efforts to join the European Union with 245 million euros from [[PHARE]], [[ISPA]] and [[SAPARD]] aid programs over the course of 2005 and 2006.

==International disputes==
Relations with neighbouring states have normalized somewhat since the breakup of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]. Work has begun — bilaterally and within the [[Stability Pact for South Eastern Europe]] since 1999 — on political and economic cooperation in the region.

===Bosnia and Herzegovina===
{{main|Bosnia and Herzegovina–Croatia relations}}
Discussions continue between Croatia and [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] on various sections of the border, the longest border with another country for each of these countries.

Sections of the [[Una (Sava)|Una]] river and villages at the base of Mount [[Plješevica]] are in Croatia, while some are in Bosnia, which causes an excessive number of border crossings on a single route and impedes any serious development in the region. The [[Zagreb]]-[[Bihać]]-[[Split (city)|Split]] railway line is still closed for major traffic due to this issue.

The border on the Una river between Hrvatska [[Kostajnica]] on the northern, Croatian side of the river, and Bosanska [[Kostajnica]] on the southern, Bosnian side, is also being discussed. A river island between the two towns is under Croatian control, but is also claimed by Bosnia. A shared border crossing point has been built and has been functioning since 2003, and is used without hindrance by either party.

The Herzegovinian [[municipality]] of [[Neum]] in the south makes the southernmost part of Croatia an [[exclave]] and the two countries are negotiating special transit rules through Neum to compensate for that. Recently Croatia has opted to build a [[Pelješac bridge|bridge to the Pelješac peninsula]] to connect the Croatian mainland with the exclave but Bosnia and Herzegovina has protested that it will close their way to [[international waters]] (although Croatian territory and [[territorial waters]] surround Bosnian-Herzegovinan ones completely) and has suggested that the bridge must be higher than 55 meters for free passage of all types of ships. Negotiations are still being held.

===Slovenia===
{{main|Croatia–Slovenia relations|Croatia–Slovenia border disputes}}

Croatia and [[Slovenia]] have several land and [[maritime boundary]] disputes.
Slovenia claims that the maritime border in [[gulf of Piran|Piran Bay]] does not go through the middle of the bay, while Croatia claims it does. This is causing problems for fishermen due to there being an undefined area where the naval police of each country may patrol. Related to the border in Piran Bay is Slovenian access to international waters in the form of a corridor which would require Croatia to cede its exclusive rights over at least some of its territorial waters to the west of [[Umag]].

A small number of pockets of land on the right-hand side of the river [[Dragonja]] in [[Istria]] have remained under Croatian jurisdiction after the river was re-routed after the [[Second World War]]. This area is located near the Sečovlje-Plovanija official border crossing point (set up by an interim agreement of the two countries in the 1990s).

The area around the peak of the [[Žumberačka gora|Žumberak]] mountain is assigned partly to Slovenia and partly to Croatia (the [[Sveta Gera]] area). However, an old [[Yugoslav People's Army]] barracks building on the Croatian part of the border is still occupied by a small number of [[Slovenian army]] personnel.

Slovenia is disputing Croatia's claim to establish an economic section of the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]], requiring direct access to the international waters. Croatia decided to pursue a policy of stricter control over fishing and other economic use of the sea. This policy has been in place since late 2004 but excludes the EU countries (namely, Slovenia and Italy).

Other issues that have yet to be fully resolved include:
* Joint management of the [[Krško Nuclear Power Plant]]
* [[Property|property rights]]
* Croatian depositors' savings in Ljubljanska banka from [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|SFRY]] times. This is related to the loss of savings deposited in the [[Zagreb]] branch of the former Ljubljanska Banka.

===Montenegro===
[[Image:Vicinity-of-Prevlaka-in-Croatia-and-Montenegro.PNG|thumb]]
In late 2002, Croatia and [[Serbia and Montenegro]] adopted an interim agreement to settle the disputed [[Prevlaka]] peninsula at the entrance of the [[Boka Kotorska|Bay of Kotor]] in Croatia's favour, allowing the withdrawal of the [[United Nations Mission of Observers in Prevlaka|UN monitoring mission]]. This agreement applies to [[Montenegro]] since its independence. Countries agreed to settle all possible disputes at International Court of Justice in Hague.

===Serbia===
{{main|Croatia – Serbia relations}}

Due to the [[meander]]ing of the [[Danube]], the eastern border of [[Baranja region|Baranja]] with [[Serbia]] according to cadastral delineation is not followed, as each country controls territory on their side of the main river flow.
Further south, near [[Vukovar]] and near [[Šarengrad]], there are two river islands ([[Island of Vukovar|Vukovarska ada]] and [[Island of Šarengrad|Šarengradska ada]]) which have been part of SR Croatia (during Yugoslavia) but during the war they came under Serbian control.
Croatia is asking that the islands be returned because of the [[Badinter Arbitration Committee]] decision from 1991 that all internal borders between Yugoslav republics have become international. [[Serbia]] is refusing to return the islands (and disregards the committee decision) with the explanation that they are nearer to the Serbian side of the river so they are Serbian.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dnevnik.rs/arhiva/30-07-2002/Strane/spec.htm ]{{dead link|date=June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Military occupation of the islands ended recently after an incident in which Serbian military opened fire and arrested the mayor of [[Vukovar]] [[Vladimir Štengel]] with 19 other Croatian civilians and 8 children who were going to visit [[Zvezdan Kisić]] the [[mayor]] of the Serbian town [[Bačka Palanka]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hsp1861.hr/vijesti2/020729tp.htm |title=Slobodna Dalmacija: 29 |publisher=Hsp1861.hr |date= |accessdate=2010-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; These islands are now under Serbian police control.

===Italy===
{{main|Croatia – Italy relations}}
{{mergeinto|Croatia – Italy relations|date=February 2011}}

Croatia and [[Italy]] continue to debate bilateral property and [[ethnic minority]] rights issues stemming from border changes after [[World War II]].

There are a number of people who are Italian citizens but who had previously been citizens of Yugoslavia before they opted to Italy, shortly after World War II - known as the ''esuli'' (exiles) or ''optanti'' (volunteers). A later contract between [[SFR Yugoslavia]] and Italy prevented the restitution of their property since a deal was made that treated this seized property as [[war reparations]].

Nevertheless, there are now at least two groups of people dissatisfied with the situation:
* people who were exiled during a period not covered by the aforementioned agreement (post 1956?) who demand that their property be returned
* the people who were exiled and/or their children who wish to buy real-estate in the same areas (if not the same buildings or land)
Neither of these was allowed to pursue in Croatia legally. However, after adoption of the new laws in Croatia (that were required for the accession of Croatia to the EU), it is now allowed to citizens of all member states of the EU to buy real-estate in Croatia.

Another problem that arose a couple of years ago deals with the fishing zones in the Adriatic sea. Italy denies the right of Croatia to proclaim its own fishing zone before January 1, 2008, because that would break an earlier agreement with Italy and Slovenia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/newsbriefs/setimes/newsbriefs/2007/12/12/nb-05 |title=Croatia's Mesic suggests modification of proposed fishing zone likely |publisher=SETimes.com |date=2008-01-01 |accessdate=2010-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time Italy, without breaking the agreement, has proclaimed its own zone.

The '''known history of [[Cuba]]''', the largest of the [[Caribbean]] islands, predates [[Christopher Columbus]]' sighting of the island during his first voyage of discovery on 27 October 1492. Evidence suggests that, before Columbus' arrival, the indigenous [[Guanajatabey]], who had inhabited the island for centuries, were driven to the west of Cuba by the arrival of two subsequent waves of migrants, the [[Taíno]] and [[Ciboney]]. These groups are sometimes referred to as [[neo-Taíno nations]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gott&quot;&gt;[[Richard Gott|Gott, Richard]] Cuba: A new history, Yale University Press: 2004, Chapter 1.&lt;/ref&gt; These new peoples had migrated north along the Caribbean island chain and mostly used stone tools, yet they were familiar with [[gold]] (which they called ''caona'') and [[copper]] (''guanín'').

The Taíno and Ciboney were part of a cultural group commonly called the [[Arawak peoples|Arawak]], which extended far into [[South America]]. Initially, the new arrivals inhabited the eastern area of [[Baracoa]], before expanding across the island. Traveling [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] clergyman and writer [[Bartolome de las Casas]] estimated that the Cuban population of the neo-Taíno people had reached 350,000 by the time of the late 15th century. The Taíno cultivated the [[cassava|yuca]] root, harvested it and baked it to produce cassava bread. They also grew [[cotton]] and tobacco, and ate [[maize]] and [[sweet potatoes]]. According to Las Casas, they had &quot;everything they needed for living; they had many crops, well arranged&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Historia de las Indias'', vol 3 Biblioteca Ayacucho, Caracus, 1986, pp. 81–101.&lt;/ref&gt;

After Columbus discovered it, Cuba became a [[Spanish colony]], ruled by a [[Colonial Heads of Cuba|Spanish governor]] in [[Havana]], though in 1762 this city was briefly held by [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]] before being returned in exchange for [[Florida]]. A series of [[rebellions]] during the 19th century failed to end Spanish rule. However, increased tensions between Spain and the United States, resulting in the [[Spanish-American War]], finally led to Spanish [[withdrawal]], and in 1902, Cuba gained formal independence.

Post-independence, Cuba saw significant economic development, but also political corruption and a succession of despotic leaders, culminating in the overthrow of the dictator [[Fulgencio Batista]] by the [[communist]] revolutionary [[Fidel Castro]] during the 1953-9 [[Cuban Revolution]]. Cuba has since been ruled by Castro's [[Communist Party of Cuba]], although Castro himself stepped down from leadership of the country in 2006, to be replaced by his brother [[Raúl Castro]].
			
In his book ''A History of Cuba and its relations with The United States'', historian Philip S. Foner writes that Cuba's history
&quot;has a significance out of proportion to its size. The story of Cuba's struggle for liberation from four-hundred years of Spanish domination is one of the great epics in history. The struggle for over half a century to change its status from a theoretically independent state, dominated by American imperialism, into a truly independent country is equally inspiring.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Foner, Philip S., A History of Cuba and its relations with The United States, Vol. 1.,1962&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--undue weight (WP:UNDUE) to have this rare quotation in the lede section.--&gt;

==Early Spanish colonization==

[[Image:Havana 1639b.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Havana Bay, c. 1639.]]
The first sighting of a Spanish boat approaching the island was on 28 October 1492, probably at Baracoa on the eastern point of the island.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gott&quot;/&gt; [[Christopher Columbus]], on his first voyage to the Americas, sailed south from what is now [[the Bahamas]] to explore the northeast coast of Cuba and the northern coast of [[Hispaniola]]. Columbus discovered the island believing it to be a peninsula of the Asian mainland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

During a second voyage in 1494, Columbus passed along the south coast of the island, landing at various inlets including what was to become [[Guantánamo Bay]]. With the [[Inter caetera|Papal Bull of 1493]], [[Pope Alexander VI]] commanded Spain to conquer, colonize and convert the [[Paganism|Pagans]] of the [[New World]] to [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]].&lt;ref&gt;Bakewell, Peter. ''A History of Latin America''. Blackwell Publishers, pp. 129–130.&lt;/ref&gt; On arrival, Columbus observed the Taíno dwellings, describing them as “looking like tents in a camp. All were of palm branches, beautifully constructed”.&lt;ref&gt;Willis Fletcher Johnson, ''The History of Cuba'' Volume 1, New York, 1920 p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Spanish began to create permanent settlements on the island of [[Hispaniola]], east of Cuba, soon after Columbus' arrival in the Caribbean, but it wasn't until 1509 that the coast of Cuba was fully mapped by [[Sebastián de Ocampo]].&lt;ref name=&quot;historia_naval&quot;&gt;[http://www.ipen.org.br/webpages/noticiasS.htm Historia de la Construcción Naval en Cuba]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1511, [[Diego Velázquez de Cuéllar]] set out from Hispaniola to form the first Spanish settlement in Cuba, with orders from Spain to conquer the island. The settlement was at Baracoa, but the new settlers were to be greeted with stiff resistance from the local Taíno population. The Taínos were initially organized by [[cacique]] (''chieftain'') [[Hatuey]], who had himself relocated from Hispaniola to escape the brutalities of Spanish rule on that island. After a prolonged [[guerrilla]] campaign, Hatuey and successive chieftains were captured and burnt alive, and within three years the Spanish had gained control of the island. In 1514, a settlement was founded in what was to become [[Havana]].

Clergyman [[Bartolomé de Las Casas]] observed a number of massacres initiated by the invaders as the Spanish swept over the island, notably the massacre near [[Camagüey, Cuba]], of the inhabitants of [[Caonao]]. According to his account, some three thousand villagers had traveled to Manzanillo to greet the Spanish with loaves, fishes and other foodstuffs and were &quot;without provocation, butchered&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Las Casas, ''A Short Account'', p.29&lt;/ref&gt; The surviving indigenous groups fled to the mountains or the small surrounding islands before being captured and forced into reservations. One such reservation was [[Guanabacoa]], which is today a suburb of Havana.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas1&quot;&gt;Thomas, Hugh: ''Cuba: The Pursuit of Freedom'', 2nd edition, p.14.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Hatuey monument, Baracoa, Cuba.JPG|thumb|200px|A monument to Taíno chieftain Hatuey, in [[Baracoa]], Cuba]]
In 1513, [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] issued a decree establishing the [[encomienda]] land settlement system that was to be incorporated throughout the Spanish Americas. Velázquez, who had become Governor of Cuba relocating from Baracoa to [[Santiago de Cuba]], was given the task of apportioning both the land and the indigenous Cubans to groups throughout the new colony. The scheme was not a success, however, as the Cubans either succumbed to diseases brought from Spain such as [[measles]] and [[smallpox]], or simply refused to work, preferring to slip away into the mountains.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gott&quot;/&gt; Desperate for labor to toil the new agricultural settlements, the Conquistadors sought slaves from surrounding islands and the continental mainland. But these new arrivals followed the indigenous Cubans by also dispersing into the wilderness or suffering a similar fate at the hands of disease.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gott&quot;/&gt;

Despite the difficult relations between the local Cubans and the new Europeans, some cooperation was in evidence.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} The Spanish were shown by the Native Cubans how to nurture [[tobacco]] and consume it in the form of [[cigar]]s. There were also many unions between the largely male Spanish colonists and indigenous women. Their children were called [[mestizo]]s, but the Native Cubans called them ''Guajiro'', which translates as &quot;one of us&quot;. Modern-day studies have revealed traces of Taíno [[DNA]] in individuals throughout Cuba,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/41/310.html Cuban Site Casts Light on an Extinct People] Anthony DePalma, The New York Times, 5 July 1998&lt;/ref&gt; although the population was largely destroyed as a culture and civilization after 1550. With the Spanish New Laws (1552), Cuban Indians were freed from encomienda and some seven Indian towns were set up. There are descendant Cuban Indian (Taino) families in several places, mostly in eastern Cuba. The Indian community at Caridad de los Indios, Guantanamo, is one such nuclei. An association of Indian families in Jiguani, near Santiago, is also active. The local Indian population left their mark also on the language with some 400 Taino terms and placenames of the island. Among various cults and religions, such as Danza del Cordon and in Afro-Cuban religion incorporate Taino spiritual practices. The name of ''Cuba'' itself, ''Havana'',  ''Camagüey'', and many others were derived from neo-Taino languare, and Indian words such as ''Tobacco'', ''Hurricane'' and ''Canoe'' were transferred to English and are used today.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas1&quot;/&gt;

==Arrival of African slaves==

{{Ref improve section|date=August 2009}}
The Spanish established kurtrice and [[tobacco]] as [[Cuba|Cuba's]] primary products, and the island soon supplanted Hispaniola as the prime Spanish base in the Caribbean.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Bakewell. A History of Latin America. Bakewell books. p.74.&lt;/ref&gt; Further field labor was required. African [[Slavery|slaves]] were then imported to work the plantations as field labor. However, restrictive Spanish trade laws made it difficult for Cubans to keep up with the 17th and 18th century advances in processing [[sugar cane]] pioneered in British [[History of Barbados|Barbados]] and French [[Saint Domingue]] ([[Haiti]]). Spain also restricted Cuba's access to the [[slave trade]], which was dominated by the British, French, and Dutch. One important turning point came in the [[Seven Years' War]], when the British conquered the port of Havana and introduced thousands of slaves in a ten month period. Another key event was the [[Haitian Revolution]] in nearby Saint-Domingue, from 1791 to 1804. Thousands of French refugees, fleeing the slave rebellion in Saint Domingue, brought slaves and expertise in sugar refining and [[coffee]] growing into eastern Cuba in the 1790 and early 19th century.

In the 19th century, Cuban sugar plantations became the most important world producer of sugar, thanks to the expansion of slavery and a relentless focus on improving the island's sugar technology. Use of modern refining techniques was especially important because the British [[Slave Trade Act 1807]] abolished the [[slave trade]] in the [[British Empire]] (but [[slavery]] itself remained legal until the [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833]]). Cubans were torn between the profits generated by sugar and a repugnance for slavery, which they saw as morally, politically, and racially dangerous to their society. By the end of the 19th century, slavery was abolished.

However, leading up to the abolition of slavery, Cuba gained great prosperity from its [[sugar trade]]. Originally, the Spanish had ordered regulations on trade with Cuba, which kept the island from becoming a dominant sugar producer. The Spanish were interested in keeping their trade routes and slave trade routes protected. Nevertheless, Cuba's vast size and abundance of natural resources made it an ideal place for becoming a booming sugar producer. When Spain opened the Cuban trade ports, it quickly became a popular place. New technology allowed a much more effective and efficient means of producing sugar. They began to use water mills, enclosed furnaces, and steam engines to produce a higher quality of sugar at a much more efficient pace than elsewhere in the Caribbean.

The boom in Cuba's sugar industry in the 19th century made it necessary for Cuba to improve its means of transportation. Planters needed safe and efficient ways to transport the sugar from the plantations to the ports, in order to maximize their returns. Many new roads were built, and old roads were quickly repaired. Railroads were built early and changed the way that perishable sugar cane (within one or two days after the cane is cut easily crystallizable sucrose sugar has &quot;inverted&quot; to turn into far less recoverable glucose and fructose sugars) is collected and allowing more rapid and effective sugar transportation. It was now possible for plantations all over this large island to have their sugar shipped quickly and easily. The prosperity seen from the boom in sugar production is a major reason that Cuban ethnicity became further enriched by new influx of Spanish migrants. Many Spaniards immigrated to Cuba, calling it a place of refuge.

==Sugar plantations==

Cuba failed to prosper before the 1760s due to Spanish trade regulations. Spain had set up a monopoly in the Caribbean and their primary objective was to protect this. They did not allow the islands to trade with any foreign ships. Spain was primarily interested in the Caribbean for its gold. The Spanish crown thought that if the colonies traded with other countries it would not itself benefit from it. This slowed the growth of the Spanish Caribbean. This effect was particularly bad in Cuba because Spain kept a tight grasp on it. It held great strategic importance in the Caribbean. As soon as Spain opened Cuba's ports up to foreign ships, a great sugar boom began that lasted until the 1880s. The Island was perfect for growing sugar. It is dominated by rolling plains, with rich soil and adequate rainfall. It is the largest island in the Caribbean. Its relatively low mountains and large plains are suitable for roads and railroads, and it has the best ports in the area. By 1860, Cuba was devoted to growing sugar. The country had to import all other necessary goods. They were dependent on the United States who bought 82 percent of the sugar. Cubans resented the economic policy Spain implemented in Cuba, which was to help Spain and hurt Cuba. In 1820, Spain abolished the slave trade, hurting the Cuban economy even more and forcing planters to buy more expensive, illegal, and troublesome slaves (as demonstrated by the events surrounding the ship [[Amistad (case)|Amistad]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

==Cuba under attack==
[[Image:British fleet entering Havana.jpg|thumb|250px|The British fleet closing in on Havana in 1762]]
[[Image:El Morro.jpg|250px|thumb|[[Morro Castle (fortress)|El Morro fortress]] in Havana, built in 1589]]
Cuba had long been a target of [[buccaneer]]s, [[pirate]]s and French [[corsair]]s seeking Spain's [[New World]] riches. Repeated raids meant that defences were bolstered throughout the island during the 16th century. Havana was furnished with the fortress of [[Castillo de los Tres Reyes Magos del Morro]] to deter potential invaders, which included the English [[privateer]] [[Francis Drake]], who sailed within sight of Havana harbour but did not disembark on the island.&lt;ref name=&quot;Drake&quot;&gt;Gott, Richard: Cuba, A  A new history, Yale University Press: 2004, p 32&lt;/ref&gt; Havana's inability to resist invaders was dramatically exposed in 1628, when a Dutch fleet led by [[Piet Heyn]] plundered the Spanish ships in the city's harbor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heyn and Myngs&quot;&gt;Gott, Richard: Cuba, A  A new history, Yale University Press: 2004, p 34-35&lt;/ref&gt; In 1662, on the eastern part of the island, English admiral and pirate [[Christopher Myngs]] captured and briefly occupied [[Santiago de Cuba]] in an effort to open up Cuba's protected trade with neighbouring [[Jamaica]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Heyn and Myngs&quot;/&gt;

Nearly a century later, the English were to invade in earnest, taking [[Guantánamo Bay (Cuba)|Guantánamo Bay]] in 1741 during the [[War of Jenkins' Ear]] with Spain. [[Edward Vernon]], the British admiral who devised the scheme, saw his 4,000 occupying troops capitulate to local [[guerilla]] resistance, and more critically, a disease epidemic, forcing him to withdraw his fleet to British-owned Jamaica.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vernon&quot;&gt;Gott, Richard: Cuba, A  new history, Yale University Press: 2004, p 39-41&lt;/ref&gt; Seven years later, in 1748, tensions between the three dominant colonial powers, Britain, France and Spain, were transported to the Caribbean. A skirmish between British and Spanish squadrons off the coast of Cuba became known as the [[Battle of Havana (1748)|Battle of Havana]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Vernon&quot;/&gt;

The [[Seven Years' War]], which erupted in 1754 across three continents, eventually arrived in the Spanish Caribbean. Spain's alliance with the French pitched them into direct conflict with the British, and in 1762 a British [[British expedition against Cuba|expedition]] of 5 warships and 4,000 troops set out from [[Portsmouth]] to capture Cuba. The British arrived on 6 June, and by August had Havana under [[siege]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Siege&quot;&gt;Thomas, Hugh: Cuba: The Pursuit of Freedom 2nd edition. Chapter One&lt;/ref&gt;
When Havana surrendered, the admiral of the British fleet, [[George Keppel, 3rd Earl of Albemarle|George Keppel]], the 3rd [[Earl of Albemarle]], entered the city as a conquering new governor and took control of the whole western part of the island.
The arrival of the British immediately opened up trade with their North American and Caribbean colonies, causing a rapid transformation of Cuban society. Food, horses and other goods flooded into the city, and thousands of slaves from West Africa were transported to the island to work on the undermanned sugar plantations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Siege&quot;/&gt; Though Havana, which had become the third largest city in the Americas, was to enter an era of sustained development and closening ties with North America, the British occupation was not to last. Pressure from [[London]] sugar merchants fearing a decline in sugar prices forced a series of negotiations with the Spanish over colonial territories. Less than a year after Havana was seized, the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Peace of Paris]] was signed by the three warring powers, ending the Seven Years' War. The treaty gave Britain [[Florida]] in exchange for Cuba on the recommendation of the French, who advised that declining the offer could result in Spain losing [[Mexico]] and much of the South American mainland to the British.&lt;ref name=&quot;Siege&quot;/&gt; This led to disappointment in Britain, as many believed that Florida was a poor return for Cuba and [[Great Britain in the Seven Years War|Britain's other gains in the war]].

==The 19th century: years of upheaval==
In the early 19th century, three major political currents took shape in Cuba: '''reformism''', '''annexation''' and '''independence'''. In addition, there were spontaneous and isolated actions carried out from time to time, adding a current of '''abolitionism'''.

The [[US independence|declaration of independence]] by the [[13 colonies|13 British colonies]] of North America, and the victory of the [[French Revolution]] of 1789, influenced early Cuban liberation movements, as did the successful revolt of black slaves in [[Haiti]]. One of the first, headed by a free [[Black people|black]], [[Nicolás Morales]], was aimed at the equality between &quot;mulattos and whites&quot; and the abolition of sales taxes and other burdens that oppressed the poor; Morales' plot was discovered in 1795 in [[Bayamo]], and the conspirators were jailed.

===Reform, autonomy and separatist movements===
As a result of the political upheavals caused by the [[Peninsular War|Iberian Peninsular War]] and the removal of [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Ferdinand VII]] from the Spanish throne, a separatist rebellion emerged among the Cuban Creole aristocracy in 1809 and 1810. One of its leaders, [[Joaquín Infante]], drafted Cuba's first [[constitution]], declaring the island a sovereign state, presuming the rule of the countries' wealthy, maintaining slavery as long as it was necessary for agriculture, establishing a social classification based on skin colour and declaring [[Catholicism]] the official religion. This conspiracy also failed and the main leaders were sentenced to prison and deported to Spain.&lt;ref name = &quot;xrhsoz&quot;&gt;Cantón Navarro, José and Juan Jacomino. ''History of Cuba: The Challenge of the Yoke and the Star: Biography of a People''. Havana, Editoral SI-MAR, 1998, p. 35, ISBN 959-705-419-1.&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1812, a mixed-race abolitionist conspiracy arose, organized by [[José Antonio Aponte]], a free black carpenter in Havana. He and others were executed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

The main reason for the lack of support for these efforts was that the vast majority of Creoles, especially the plantation owners, rejected any kind of separatism, considering Spain's power essential to the maintainence of slavery. The [[Spanish Constitution of 1812]], and the legislation passed by the [[Cádiz Cortes]] after it was set up in 1808, created a number of liberal political and commercial policies, which were welcomed in Cuba but also curtailed a number of previous political and commercial liberties. Between 1810 and 1814, the island elected six representatives to the Cortes, in addition to forming a locally-elected Provincial Deputation.&lt;ref&gt;Rieu-Millan, Marie Laure. ''Los diputados americanos en las Cortes de Cádiz: Igualdad o independencia.'' Madrid: Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas, 1990, 41. ISBN 978-8400070915&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the liberal regime and the Constitution proved to be ephemeral: they were suppressed by Ferdinand VII when he returned to the throne in 1814. Therefore, by the end of the decade, some Cubans were inspired by the successes of [[Simón Bolívar]], despite the fact that the Spanish Constitution was restored in 1820. Numerous secret societies emerged, of which the most important was the so-called &quot;Soles y Rayos Bolívar&quot;, founded in 1821 and led by [[José Francisco Lemus]]. Its aim was to establish the free Republic of Cubanacán, and it had branches in five districts of the island. In 1823, the society's leaders were arrested and condemned to exile. In the same year, Ferdinand VII, with French help and the approval of the [[Quintuple Alliance]], managed to abolish constitutional rule in Spain yet again and reestablish [[Absolute monarchy|absolutism]]. As a result, the national militia of Cuba, established by the Constitution and a potential instrument for liberal agitation, was dissolved, a permanent executive military commission under the orders of the governor was created, newspapers were closed, elected provincial representatives were removed and other liberties suppressed.

This suppression and the success of independence movements in the former Spanish colonies on the North American mainland led to a rise of Cuban nationalism, and a number of independence conspiracies took place during the 1820s and 1830s, but all failed. Among these were the &quot;Expedición de los Trece&quot; (Expedition of the 13) in 1826, the &quot;Gran Legión del Aguila Negra&quot; (Great Legion of the Black Eagle) in 1829, the &quot;Cadena Triangular&quot; (Triangular Chain) and the &quot;Soles de la Libertad&quot; (Suns of Liberty) in 1837. Leading national figures in these years included [[Félix Varela]] and Cuba's first revolutionary poet, [[José María Heredia]].&lt;ref&gt;Navarro, José Cantón: History of Cuba, La Habana, 1998, p. 36-38, ISBN 959-705-19-1&lt;/ref&gt; The US also opposed possible agreements between Spain and England.

===Antislavery and independence movements===
In 1836, the first armed uprising for independence took place in Puerto Príncipe ([[Camagüey]] Province), led by [[Francisco de Agüero]] and [[Andrés Manuel Sánchez]]. Agüero (a white man) and Sánchez (a [[mulatto]]) were both executed, becoming the first popular martyrs of the Cuban independence movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

The 1830s saw a surge of the reformist movement, whose main leader was José Antonio Saco, standing out for his criticism of Spanish despotism and the slave trade. Nevertheless, this surge bore no fruit; Cubans remained deprived of the right to send representatives to the Spanish parliament, and [[Madrid]] stepped up repression.

Nonetheless, Spain had long been under pressure to end the slave trade. In 1817, it signed a first treaty, to which it did not adhere. With the abolishment of slavery altogether in their colonies, the British forced Spain to sign another treaty in 1835. In this context, black revolts in Cuba increased, and were put down with mass executions.
One of the most significant was the [[Conspiración de La Escalera]] (Ladder Conspiracy), which started in March 1843 and continued until 1844. The conspiracy took its name from a torture method, in which blacks were tied to a ladder and whipped until they confessed or died. The Ladder Conspiracy involved free blacks and slaves, as well as white intellectuals and professionals. It is estimated that 300 blacks and mulattos died from torture, 78 were executed, over 600 were imprisoned and over 400 expelled from the island.&lt;ref name = &quot;kotrhz&quot;&gt;Cantón Navarro, José.

Following the 1868-1878 rebellion of the [[Ten Years' War]], all slavery was abolished by 1884, making Cuba the second-to-last country in the Western Hemisphere to abolish slavery, with [[Brazil]] being the last. Instead of blacks, slave traders looked for others sources of cheap labour, such as [[Chinese people|Chinese]] colonists and Indians from [[Yucatán]]. Another feature of the population was the number of Spanish-born colonists, known as ''peninsulares'', who were mostly adult males; they constituted between ten and twenty per cent of the population between the middle of the 19th century and the [[Great Depression|great depression of the 1930s]].

===The possibility of annexation===
Black unrest and British pressure to abolish slavery motivated many Creoles to advocate Cuba's annexation by the United States, where slavery was still legal. Other Cubans supported the idea, because they longed for what they considered higher development and democratic freedom. The annexation of Cuba was repeatedly supported by the US. In 1805 President [[Thomas Jefferson]] considered possessing Cuba for strategic reasons, sending secret agents to the island to negotiate with Governor Someruelos.

In April 1823, [[US Secretary of State]] [[John Quincy Adams]] discussed the rules of political gravitation, in a theory often referred to as the &quot;ripe fruit theory&quot;. Adams wrote, “There are laws of political as well as physical gravitation; and if an apple severed by its native tree cannot choose but fall to the ground, Cuba, forcibly disjoined from its own unnatural connection with Spain, and incapable of self-support, can gravitate only towards the North American Union which by the same law of nature, cannot cast her off its bosom.” &lt;ref&gt;“Worthington, Chauncey Ford: Writings of John Quincy Adams vol. VII,
Boston, MA, 2001, p372&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;
He furthermore warned that “the transfer of Cuba to Great Britain would be an event unpropitious to the interest of this Union.”&lt;ref&gt;“Worthington, Chauncey Ford: Writings of John Quincy Adams vol. VII,  Boston, MA, 2001, p373&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Adams voiced concern that a country outside of North America would attempt to occupy Cuba upon its separation from Spain. He wrote, “The question both of our right and our power to prevent it, if necessary, by force, already obtrudes itself upon our councils, and the administration is called upon, in the performance of its duties to the nation, at least to use all the means with the competency to guard against and forefend it.” &lt;ref&gt;&quot;Worthington, Chauncey Ford: Writings of John Quincy Adams vol. VII,  Boston, MA, 2001, p379&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 December 1823, US President [[James Monroe]] specifically addressed Cuba and other European colonies in his proclamation of the [[Monroe Doctrine]]. Cuba, located just {{convert|94|mi}} from the US city of [[Key West]], was of interest to the doctrine’s founders, as they warned European forces to leave &quot;America for the Americans&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Díez de Medina, Raul: Autopsy of the Monroe doctrine’ The strange story of inter-American relations, New York, NY, 1934, p.21”&lt;/ref&gt;

The most outstanding attempts in support of annexation were made by [[Spanish Army]] General [[Narciso López]], who prepared four [[filibuster (military)|filibuster]] expeditions to Cuba in the US. The first two, in 1848 and 1849, failed before departure due to US opposition. The third, made up of some 600 men, managed to land in Cuba and take the central city of [[Cárdenas]], but failed eventually due to a lack of popular support. López's fourth expedition landed in Pinar del Río province with around 400 men in August 1851; the invaders were defeated by Spanish troops and López was executed.

===The independence struggle resumed===
{{See also|Little War (Cuba)}}
In the 1860s, Cuba had two more liberal-minded governors, Serrano and Dulce, who encouraged the creation of a Reformist Party, despite the fact that political parties were forbidden. But they were followed by a reactionary governor, Francisco Lersundi, who suppressed all liberties granted by the previous governors and maintained a pro-slavery regime.&lt;ref&gt;Cantón Navarro, José. ''History of Cuba'', p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 October 1868, landowner [[Carlos Manuel de Céspedes]] made the &quot;Grito de Yara&quot;, the &quot;Cry of Yara&quot;, declaring Cuban independence and freedom for his slaves. This began the &quot;[[Ten Years' War]]&quot;, which lasted from 1868 to 1878, and eventually contributed to the abolition of slavery.

==The War of 1895==
===Build-up to the war===
{{See also|Cuban War of Independence}}
====Social, political and economic change====
In the years of the so-called “Rewarding Truce”, lasting for 17&amp;nbsp;years from the end of the [[Ten Years War]] in 1878, there were fundamental changes in Cuban society. With the abolition of slavery in October 1886, former slaves joined the ranks of farmers and urban working class. Most wealthy Cubans lost their properties and many of them joined the urban middle class. The number of sugar mills dropped and efficiency increased with only companies and the most powerful plantation owners owning them. The numbers of [[Peasant|campesinos]] and tenant farmers rose considerably. It is the period when U.S. capital began flowing into Cuba, mostly into the sugar and tobacco businesses and mining. By 1895 investments reached 50&amp;nbsp;million U.S. dollars. Although Cuba remained Spanish politically, economically it started to depend on the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Cantón Navarro, José. ''History of Cuba'', p. 53-55.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the conditions were very difficult, these changes entailed the rise of labour movements; the first organisation was created in 1878 being the Cigar Makers Guild, followed by the Central Board of Artisans in 1879 and many more across the island.&lt;ref&gt;Cantón Navarro, José. ''History of Cuba'', p. 55-57.&lt;/ref&gt;

Abroad, a new trend of aggressive U.S. ''influence'' emerged, evident in Secretary of State [[James G. Blaine]]’s expressed ideals that all of Central and South America would some day fall to the U.S. Blaine placed particular importance on the control of Cuba. “That rich island,” he wrote on 1 December 1881, “the key to the Gulf of Mexico, is, though in the hands of Spain, a part of the American commercial system… If ever ceasing to be Spanish, Cuba must necessarily become American and not fall under any other European domination.” &lt;ref name = &quot;wqswxw&quot;&gt;[http://www.historyofcuba.com/history/scaw/scaw1.htm Spanish-Cuban-American War - History of Cuba&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Blaine’s vision did not allow the existence of an independent Cuba. “Martí noticed with alarm the movement to annex Hawaii, viewing it as establishing a pattern for Cuba…”&lt;ref name = &quot;wfbftj&quot;/&gt;

====Martí's insurrection and the start of the war====
After his second deportation to Spain in 1878, [[José Martí]] moved to the U.S. in 1881 where he took up mobilizing the support of the Cuban exile community, especially in [[Ybor City]] in the Tampa, Florida, area and [[Key West]], Florida. He was working for a revolution and independence from Spain, but also lobbying to oppose U.S. annexation of Cuba, which some American and Cuban politicians desired. After deliberations with patriotic clubs across the U.S., the Antilles and Latin America &quot;El Partido Revolucionario Cubano&quot; (The Cuban Revolutionary Party), with the purpose of gaining independence for both Cuba and Puerto Rico, was officially proclaimed on April 10, 1892. Martí was elected delegate, the highest party position. By the end of 1894 the basic conditions for launching the revolution were set.&lt;ref&gt;Cantón Navarro, José. ''History of Cuba'', p. 59-60.&lt;/ref&gt;“Martí’s impatience to start the revolution for independence was affected by his growing fear that the imperialist forces in the United States would succeed in annexing Cuba before the revolution could liberate the island from Spain.”&lt;ref name = &quot;wfbftj&quot;&gt;Foner, Philip: The Spanish-Cuban-American War and the Birth of American Imperialism quoted in: http://www.historyofcuba.com/history/scaw/scaw1.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 December 1895, three ships loaded with fighters and weapons, the ''Lagonda'', the ''Almadis'' and the ''Baracoa'', set sail for Cuba from Fernandina Beach, Florida; the weapons and supplies they carried had been difficult and costly to obtain. Two of the ships were seized by U.S. authorities in early January, who also alerted the Spanish government, but the proceedings went ahead.

The insurrection began on 24 February 1895, with uprisings all across the island. In Oriente the most important ones took place in Santiago, Guantánamo, Jiguaní, San Luis, El Cobre, El Caney, Alto Songo, Bayate and Baire. The uprisings in the central part of the island, such as Ibarra, Jagüey Grande and Aguada, suffered from poor co-ordination and failed; the leaders were captured, some of them deported and some executed. In the province of Havana the insurrection was discovered before it got off and the leaders detained. Thus, the insurgents further west in Pinar del Río were ordered to wait.

Martí, on his way to Cuba, proclaimed the [[Proclamation of Monecristi|Manifesto de Montecristi]] in [[Santo Domingo]], outlining the policy for Cuba’s war of independence: the war was to be waged by blacks and whites alike; participation of all blacks was crucial for victory; Spaniards who did not object to the war effort should be spared, private rural properties should not be damaged; and the revolution should bring new economic life to Cuba.&lt;ref name = &quot;wqswxw&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cantón Navarro, José. ''History of Cuba'', p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 1 and 11, 1895, the main Mambi leaders landed on two expeditions in Oriente: Major Antonio Maceo and 22 members near [[Baracoa]] and Martí, [[Máximo Gomez]] and four other members in Playitas. Around that time, Spanish forces in Cuba numbered about 80,000, of which 20,000 were regular troops,and 60,000 were Spanish and Cuban volunteers. The latter were a locally-enlisted force that took care of most of the ''guard and police'' duties on the island. Wealthy landowners would ''volunteer'' a number of their slaves to serve in this force, which was under local control and not under official military command. By December 98,412 regular troops had been sent to the island and the number of volunteers increased to 63,000 men. By the end of 1897 there were 240,000 regulars and 60,000 irregulars on the island. The revolutionaries were far outnumbered.&lt;ref name = &quot;wqswxw&quot;/&gt;

The Mambises were named after the Negro Spanish officer, [[Juan Ethninius Mamby]], who joined the Dominicans in the fight for independence in 1846. The Spanish soldiers referred to the insurgents as ''the men of Mamby'' and ''Mambies''. When Cuba’s first war of independence (known as the Ten Year War) broke out in 1868, some of the same soldiers were assigned to the island, importing what had by then become a derogatory Spanish slur. The Cubans adopted the name with pride.

After the Ten-Year War, possession of weapons by private individuals had been prohibited. Thus, from the very beginning of the war one of the most serious problems for the rebels was the acquisition of suitable weapons. This lack of arms led to the guerrilla-style war using the environment, the element of surprise, a fast horse and a machete. Most of the weapons were acquired in raids on the Spaniards. Between 11 June 1895, and 30 November 1897, out of 60 attempts to bring weapons and supplies to the rebels from outside the country, only one succeeded through the protection of the British. 28 were prevented already within U.S.territory; five were intercepted by the U.S. Navy, four by the Spanish Navy, two were wrecked, one was driven back to port by storm, the fate of another is unknown.&lt;ref name = &quot;wqswxw&quot;/&gt;

===Escalation of the war===
Martí was killed only shortly after his landing on 19 May 1895, at Dos Rios; but Máximo Gomez and Antonio Maceo fought on, taking the war to all parts of Oriente. By the end of June all of [[Camagüey]] was at war. Continuing west they were met by 1868 war veterans, Polish internationalists, Gen. [[Carlos Roloff]] and Serafín Sánchez in Las Villas, adding weapons, men and experience.

In mid-September representatives of the five Liberation Army Corps assembled in [[Jimaguayú]], Camagüey, to approve the ''Jimaguayú Constitution''. This constitution established a central government, which grouped the executive and legislative powers into one entity named the ''Government Council'', headed by [[Salvador Cisneros]] and [[Bartolomé Masó]].

After a period of consolidation in the three eastern provinces, the liberation armies headed for Camagüey and then for [[Matanzas]], outmanoeuvring and deceiving the Spanish Army several times, defeating the Spanish general [[Arsenio Martínez Campos]], himself the victor of the Ten Year War, and killing his most trusted general at [[Peralejo]]. Campos tried the same strategy he had employed in the Ten Year War, constructing a broad belt across the island, called the ''trocha'', about {{convert|80|km}} long and {{convert|200|m}} wide. This defense line was to limit rebel activities to the eastern provinces. The belt consisted of a [[railroad]], from Jucaro in the south to Moron in the north, on which to move armoured railcars. At various points along this railroad there were fortifications, at intervals of {{convert|12|m}} there were posts and at intervals of {{convert|400|m}} there was barbed wire. In addition, [[booby trap]]s were placed at the locations most likely to be attacked.

For the rebels, it was essential to bring the war to the western provinces of Matanzas, Havana and Pinar del Rio, where the island's government and wealth was located. The Ten Year War failed because it had not managed to proceed beyond the eastern provinces.&lt;ref name = &quot;wqswxw&quot;/&gt; In a successful cavalry campaign, overcoming the ''trochas'', the rebels invaded every province. Surrounding all the larger cities and well-fortified towns, they arrived at the westernmost tip of the island on 22 January 1896, exactly three months after the invasion near Baraguá.&lt;ref name=spanamwar-timeline&gt;{{Cite web

Campos was replaced by [[Valeriano Weyler|Gen. Valeriano Weyler y Nicolau]] (nicknamed ''The Butcher''), who reacted to these rebel successes by introducing terror methods: periodic executions, mass exiles, and the destruction of farms and crops. These methods reached their height on October 21, 1896, when he ordered all countryside residents and their livestock to gather in various fortified areas and towns occupied by his troops within eight days. Hundreds of thousands of people had to leave their homes, creating appalling conditions of overcrowding in the towns and cities. It is estimated that this measure caused the death of at least one-third of Cuba’s rural population.&lt;ref&gt;Canalejas, José in Cantón Navarro, José. ''History of Cuba'', p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; The forced relocation policy was maintained until March 1898.&lt;ref name = &quot;wqswxw&quot;/&gt;

Since the early 1880s, Spain had also been suppressing an independence movement in the [[Philippines]], which was intensifying; Spain was thus now fighting two wars, which placed a heavy burden on its economy. In secret negotiations in 1896, Spain turned down U.S. offers to buy Cuba.

Maceo was killed on 7 December 1896 in Havana province, while returning from the west.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.spanamwar.com/maceodeath.htm|title= The Death Of Cuban General Antonio Maceo|publisher=spanamwar.com, Contributed by Larry Daley |accessdate=2007-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the war continued, the major obstacle to Cuban success was weapons supply. Although weapons and funding came from within the U.S., the supply operation violated American laws, which were enforced by the [[U.S. Coast Guard]]; of 71 resupply missions, only 27 got through, with 5 being stopped by the Spanish and 33 by the U.S. Coast Guard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

In 1897, the liberation army maintained a privileged position in Camagüey and Oriente, where the Spanish only controlled a few cities. Spanish liberal leader Praxedes Sagasta admitted in May 1897: “After having sent 200,000 men and shed so much blood, we don’t own more land on the island than what our soldiers are stepping on”.&lt;ref&gt;Cantón Navarro, José. ''History of Cuba'', p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; The rebel force of 3,000 defeated the Spanish in various encounters, such as the battle of La Reforma and the surrender of Las Tunas on 30 August, and the Spaniards were kept on the defensive. Las Tunas had been guarded by over 1,000 well-armed and well-supplied men.

As stipulated at the Jimaguayú Assembly two years earlier, a second Constituent Assembly met in La Yaya, Camagüey, on 10 October 1897. The newly-adopted constitution decreed that a military command be subordinated to civilian rule. The government was confirmed, naming Bartolomé Masó as president and Dr. Domingo Méndez Capote vice as president.

[[Madrid]] decided to change its policy toward Cuba, replacing Weyler, drawing up a colonial constitution for Cuba and [[Puerto Rico]], and installing a new government in Havana. But with half the country out of its control, and the other half in arms, the new government was powerless and rejected by the rebels.

===The ''Maine'' incident===
[[Image:USSMaine.jpg|thumb|285px|right|Wreckage of the ''Maine'', 1898]]
The Cuban struggle for independence had captured the American imagination for years and newspapers had been agitating for intervention with sensational stories of Spanish atrocities against the native Cuban population, intentionally sensationalized and exaggerated. Americans believed that Cuba's battle with Spain resembled America's Revolutionary War.

This continued even after Spain replaced Weyler and changed its policies and American public opinion was very much in favour of intervening in favour of the Cubans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

In January 1898, a riot by Cuban Spanish loyalists against the new autonomous government broke out in Havana leading to the destruction of the printing presses of four local newspapers for publishing articles critical of Spanish Army atrocities. The US Consul-General cabled Washington with fears for the lives of Americans living in Havana. In response the battleship [[USS Maine (ACR-1)|USS ''Maine'']] was sent to [[Havana]] in the last week of January. On 15 February 1898 the Maine was rocked by an explosion, killing 268 of the crew and sinking the ship in the harbour. The cause of the explosion has not been clearly established to this day.

In an attempt to appease the US the colonial government took two steps that had been demanded by President [[William McKinley]]: it ended the forced relocation and offered negotiations with the independence fighters. But the truce was rejected by the rebels.

==The Spanish-American War / the Cuban theatre==
{{Main|Spanish-American War}}

The explosion of the Maine sparked a wave of indignation in the US. Newspaper owners such as [[William R. Hearst]] leapt to the conclusion that Spanish officials in Cuba were to blame, and they widely publicized the conspiracy although Spain could have had no interest in getting the US involved in the conflict.&lt;ref name = &quot;webhmz&quot;&gt;Cantón Navarro, José. ''History of Cuba'', p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yellow journalism]] fuelled American anger by publishing &quot;atrocities&quot; committed by Spain in Cuba. Hearst, when informed by [[Frederic Remington]], whom he had hired to furnish illustrations for his newspaper, that conditions in Cuba were not bad enough to warrant hostilities, allegedly replied, &quot;You furnish the pictures and I'll furnish the war.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://academic2.american.edu/~wjc/wjc3/notlikely.htm|title=Not likely sent: The Remington-Hearst &quot;telegrams&quot;|author=W. Joseph Campbell|date=summer 2000|publisher=Journalism and Mass Communication Quarterly}}&lt;/ref&gt;
McKinley, Speaker of the House [[Thomas Brackett Reed]], and the business community opposed the growing public demand for war, which was lashed to fury by yellow journalism. The American cry of the hour became, ''Remember the Maine, To Hell with Spain!''

The decisive event was probably the speech of Senator [[Redfield Proctor]] delivered on 17 March, analyzing the situation and concluding that war was the only answer. The business and religious communities switched sides, leaving McKinley and Reed almost alone in their opposition to the war.&lt;ref&gt;Offner 1992 pp 131–35; Michelle Bray Davis and Rollin W. Quimby, &quot;Senator Proctor's Cuban Speech: Speculations on a Cause of the Spanish-American War&quot;, ''Quarterly Journal of Speech'' 1969 55(2): 131–41. ISSN 0033-5630.&lt;/ref&gt; “Faced with a revved up, war-ready population, and all the editorial encouragement the two competitors could muster, the US jumped at the opportunity to get involved and showcase its new steam-powered Navy”.&lt;ref name = &quot;wqswxw&quot; /&gt; On 11 April McKinley asked Congress for authority to send American troops to Cuba for the purpose of ending the civil war there. On 19 April Congress passed [[joint resolution]]s (by a vote of 311 to 6 in the House and 42 to 35 in the Senate) supporting Cuban independence and disclaiming any intention to annex Cuba, demanding Spanish withdrawal, and authorizing the president to use as much military force as he thought necessary to help Cuban patriots gain independence from Spain. This was adopted by resolution of Congress and included from Senator [[Henry Teller]] the [[Teller Amendment]], which passed unanimously, stipulating that “the island of Cuba is, and by right should be, free and independent”.&lt;ref name = &quot;webhmz&quot;/&gt; The amendment disclaimed any intention on the part of the US to exercise jurisdiction or control over Cuba for other than pacification reasons, and confirmed that the armed forces would be removed once the war is over. Senate and Congress passed the amendment on 19 April, McKinley signed the joint resolution on 20 April and the ultimatum was forwarded to Spain. War was declared on 20/21 April 1898.

“It's been suggested that a major reason for the US war against Spain was the fierce competition emerging between Joseph Pulitzer's New York World and William Randolph Hearst's New York Journal.” Joseph E. Wisan wrote in an essay titled &quot;The Cuban Crisis As Reflected In The New York Press”, published in “American Imperialism” in 1898: “In the opinion of the writer, the Spanish-American War would not have occurred had not the appearance of Hearst in New York journalism precipitated a bitter battle for newspaper circulation.” It has also been argued that the main reason the U.S. entered the war was the failed secret attempt, in 1896, to purchase Cuba from a weaker, war-depleted Spain.&lt;ref name = &quot;wqswxw&quot;/&gt; {{See|Propaganda of the Spanish American War}}

Hostilities started hours after the declaration of war when a US contingent under Admiral William T. Sampson blockaded several Cuban ports. The Americans decided to invade Cuba and to start in Oriente where the Cubans had almost absolute control and were able to co-operate, for example, by establishing a [[beachhead]] and protecting the US landing in Daiquiri. The first US objective was to capture the city of Santiago de Cuba in order to destroy Linares' army and Cervera's fleet. To reach Santiago they had to pass through concentrated Spanish defences in the San Juan Hills and a small town in [[El Caney]]. Between 22 and 24 June the Americans landed under General [[William R. Shafter]] at [[Daiquirí]] and [[Siboney, Cuba|Siboney]], east of Santiago, and established a base.
The port of Santiago became the main target of naval operations. The US fleet attacking Santiago needed shelter from the summer hurricane season. Thus nearby [[Guantánamo Bay]] with its excellent harbour was chosen for this purpose and attacked on 6 June ([[1898 invasion of Guantánamo Bay]]). The [[Battle of Santiago de Cuba]], on 3 July 1898, was the largest naval engagement during the Spanish-American War resulting in the destruction of the Spanish Caribbean Squadron (Flota de Ultramar).

Resistance in Santiago consolidated around Fort Canosa,&lt;ref&gt;Daley#, L. 2000. El Fortin Canosa en la Cuba del 1898. in Los Ultimos Dias del Comienzo. Ensayos sobre la Guerra Hispano-Cubana-Estadounidense. B. E. Aguirre and E. Espina eds. RiL Editores, Santiago de Chile pp. 161–71.&lt;/ref&gt; all the while major battles between Spaniards and Americans took place at Las Guasimas ([[Battle of Las Guasimas]]) on 24 June El Caney [[Battle of El Caney]] and San Juan Hill [[Battle of San Juan Hill]] on 1 July 1898 outside of Santiago &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.homeofheroes.com/wallofhonor/spanish_am/10_sanjuan.html The Battles at El Caney and San Juan Hills] at HomeOfHeroes.com.&lt;/ref&gt; after which the American advance ground to a halt. Spanish troops successfully defended Fort Canosa, allowing them to stabilize their line and bar the entry to Santiago. The Americans and Cubans forcibly began a bloody, strangling siege of the city&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Daley|2000|pp=161–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; which eventually surrendered on 16 July after the defeat of the Spanish Caribbean Squadron. Thus, Oriente was under control of Americans and the Cubans, but US General [[Nelson A. Miles]] would not allow Cuban troops to enter Santiago, claiming that he wanted to prevent clashes between Cubans and Spaniards. Thus, Cuban General [[Calixto Carcía]], head of the mambi forces in the Eastern department, ordered his troops to hold their respective areas and resigned, writing a letter of protest to General Shafter.&lt;ref name = &quot;webhmz&quot;/&gt;

After losing the Philippines and Puerto Rico, which had also been invaded by the US, and with no hope of holding on to Cuba, Spain sued for peace on 17 July 1898.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.spanamwar.com/|title=The Spanish American War Centennial Website!| publisher=spanamwar.com|accessdate=2007-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 August the US and Spain signed a protocol of Peace in which Spain agreed to relinquish all claim of sovereignty over and title of Cuba.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

The treaty set no time limit for US occupation and the [[Isla de la Juventud|Isle of Pines]] was excluded from Cuba.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cantón Navarro p. 77&quot;&gt;Cantón Navarro, José. ''History of Cuba'', p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt;
Although the treaty officially granted Cuba's independence, US General William R. Shafter refused to allow Cuban General Calixto García and his rebel forces to participate in the surrender ceremonies in Santiago de Cuba.

==The first US occupation / Platt amendment==
After the Spanish troops left the island in December 1898, the government of Cuba was handed over to the United States on 1 January 1899. The first governor was General [[John R. Brooke]]. Unlike [[Guam]], [[Puerto Rico]], and the [[Philippines]], the United States did not annex Cuba because of the restrictions imposed in the [[Teller Amendment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url= http://www.etsu.edu/cas/history/docs/teller.htm|title=The Teller Amendment|year=1898|publisher=East Tennessee State University|accessdate=2007-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political changes===
The US administration was undecided on Cuba’s future status. Once it had been pried away from the Spaniards it was to be assured that it moved and remained in the US sphere. How this was to be achieved was a matter of intense discussion and annexation was an option, not only on the mainland but also in Cuba. McKinley spoke about the links that should exist between the two nations.&lt;ref&gt;Cantón Navarro, José. ''History of Cuba'', p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;

Brooke set up a civilian government, also placed US governors in seven newly created departments and named civilian governors in the provinces as well as mayors and representatives in municipalities. Many Spanish colonial government officials were kept in their posts. People were ordered to disarm and, ignoring the Mambi Army, Brooke created the Rural Guard and municipal police corps at the service of the occupation forces. Judicial powers and courts remained legally based on the same codes of the Spanish government. Tomás Estrada Palma, successor of Martí as delegate of the Cuban Revolutionary Party, dissolved the party a few days after the signing of the Paris Treaty in December 1898, claiming that the objectives of the party had been met. The revolutionary Assembly of Representatives was disregarded and also dissolved. Thus, the three representative institutions of the national liberation movement disappeared.&lt;ref&gt;Cantón Navarro, José. ''History of Cuba'', p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic changes===
Before the US officially took over the government, it had already begun cutting tariffs on US goods entering Cuba without granting the same rights to Cuban goods going to the US.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cantón Navarro p. 75&quot;&gt;Cantón Navarro, José. ''History of Cuba'', p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; Government payments had to be made in US dollars.&lt;ref&gt;Cantón Navarro, José. ''History of Cuba'', p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of the [[Foraker Amendment]], prohibiting the US occupation government from granting privileges and concessions to US investors, the Cuban economy, facilitated by the occupation government, was soon dominated by US capital.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cantón Navarro p. 75&quot;/&gt; The growth of US sugar estates was so quick that in 1905 nearly 10% of Cuba’s total land area belonged to US citizens. By 1902 US companies controlled 80% of Cuba’s ore exports and owned most of the sugar and cigarette factories.&lt;ref&gt;Cantón Navarro, José. ''History of Cuba'', p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;

The US Army also began a massive public health program to fight endemic diseases, mainly [[yellow fever]], and an education system was organized at all levels, increasing the number of primary schools fourfold.

===Elections and independence===
Voices soon began to be heard, demanding a Constituent Assembly.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cantón Navarro p. 77&quot;/&gt; In December 1899 the US War Secretary assured that the occupation was temporary, that municipal elections would be held, that a Constituent Assembly would be set up, followed by general elections and that sovereignty would be handed to Cubans. Brooke was replaced by General Leonard Wood to oversee the transition. Parties were created, including the [[Cuban National Party]], the [[Federal Republican Party of Las Villas]], the [[Republican Party of Havana]] and the [[Democratic Union Party (Cuba)|Democratic Union Party]].

[[Cuban local elections, 1900|The first elections]] for mayors, treasurers and attorneys of the country’s 110 municipalities for a one-year-term took place on 16 June 1900 but balloting was limited to literate Cubans older than 21 and with properties worth more than 250 US dollars. Only members of the dissolved Liberation Army were exempt from these conditions. Thus, the number of about 418,000 male citizens over 21 was reduced to about 151,000. 360,000 women were totally excluded. The same elections were held one year later, again for a one-year-term.

Elections for 31 delegates to a Constituent Assembly were held on 15 September 1900 with the same balloting restrictions. In all three elections pro-independence candidates including a large number of mambi delegates won the overwhelming majority.&lt;ref name = &quot;diwapu&quot;&gt;Cantón Navarro, José. ''History of Cuba'', p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; The Constitution was drawn up from November 1900 to February 1901 and then passed by the Assembly. It established the republican form of government, proclaimed internationally recognized individual rights and liberties, freedom of religion, separation between Church and State and the composition, structure and functions of state powers.

On 2 March 1901 the US-Congress passed the [[Army Appropriations Act (1901)|Army Appropriations Act]] stipulating the conditions for the withdrawal of United States troops remaining in [[Cuba]] since the [[Spanish-American War]]. As a [[rider (politics)|rider]] this act included the '''[[Platt Amendment]]''', which defined the terms of Cuban-US relations until 1934. It replaced the earlier [[Teller Amendment]]. The amendment provided for a number of rules heavily infringing on Cuba’s sovereignty:
*Cuba would not transfer Cuban land to any power other than the United States.
*Cuba would contract no [[foreign debt]] without guarantees that the interest could be served from ordinary revenues.
*The right to US intervention in Cuban affairs and military occupation when the US authorities considered that the life, properties and rights of US citizens were in danger,
*Cuba was prohibited from negotiating treaties with any country other than the United States &quot;which will impair or to impair the independence of Cuba&quot;.
*Cuba was prohibited to &quot;permit any foreign power or powers to obtain … lodgement in or control over any portion&quot; of Cuba.
*The Isle of Pines (now called [[Isla de la Juventud]]) was deemed outside the boundaries of Cuba until the title to it was adjusted in a future treaty.
*The sale or lease to the United States of &quot;lands necessary for coaling or naval stations at certain specified points to be agreed upon.&quot; The amendment ceded to the United States the naval base in Cuba ([[Guantanamo Bay Naval Base|Guantánamo Bay]]) and granted the right to use a number of other naval bases as coal stations.

As a precondition to Cuba’s independence the US demanded that this amendment be approved fully and without changes by the Constituent Assembly as an appendix to the new constitution. Faced with this alternative the appendix was approved after heated debating with a margin of 4 votes. Governor Wood admitted: “Little or no independence had been left to Cuba with the Platt Amendment and the only thing appropriate was to seek annexation”&lt;ref name = &quot;diwapu&quot;/&gt;

In the following presidential elections on 31 December 1901 [[Tomás Estrada Palma]], a US citizen still living in the United States, was the only candidate. His adversary, General [[Barolomé Masó]], withdrew his candidacy in protest against US favoritism and the manipulation of the political machine by Palma’s followers. Palma was elected to be the Republic’s first President and only returned to Cuba four months after the election. US occupation officially ended when Palma took office on 20 May 1902.&lt;ref&gt;Cantón Navarro, José. ''History of Cuba'', p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cuba in the early 20th century==
In 1902, the United States handed over control to a Cuban government that as a condition of the transfer had included in its constitution provisions implementing the requirements of the [[Platt Amendment]], which among other things gave the United States the right to intervene militarily in Cuba.

President [[Tomás Estrada Palma]] was elected in 1902, and Cuba was declared independent, though [[Guantánamo Bay, Cuba|Guantanamo Bay]] was leased to the United States as part of the Platt Amendment. The status of the [[Isla de la Juventud|Isle of Pines]] as Cuban territory was left undefined until 1925 when the United States finally recognized Cuban sovereignty over the island. Estrada Palma, a frugal man, governed successfully for his four year term; yet when he tried to extend his time in office, a revolt ensued. In 1906, the United States representative [[William Howard Taft]], notably with the personal diplomacy of [[Frederick Funston]], negotiated an end of the successful revolt led by able young general [[Enrique Loynaz del Castillo]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

For three decades, the country was led by former [[List of Presidents of Cuba|War of Independence leaders]], who after being elected did not serve more than two constitutional terms. The Cuban presidential succession was as follows: [[José Miguel Gómez]] (1908–1912); [[Mario Garcia Menocal]] (1913–1920); [[Alfredo Zayas]] (1921–25).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

In [[World War I]], Cuba declared war on [[Imperial Germany]] on 7 April 1917, the day after the US entered the war. Despite being unable to send troops to fight in Europe, Cuba played a significant role as a base to protect the West Indies from U-Boat attacks. A draft law was instituted, and 25,000 Cuban troops raised, but the war ended before they could be sent into action.

===After World War I===
President [[Gerardo Machado]] was elected by popular vote in 1925, but he was constitutionally barred from reelection. Machado, who determined to modernize Cuba, set in motion several massive civil works projects such as the Central Highway, but at the end of his constitutional term he held on to power. The United States, despite the Platt Amendment, decided not to interfere militarily. The communists of the PCC did very little to resist Machado in his dictator phase; however, numerous other groups did. In the late 1920s and early 1930s a number of Cuban action groups, including some Mambí, staged a series of uprisings that either failed or did not affect the capital. After much complex rebellion, Machado was asked to leave by the Cuban Army and senior Cuban civil leaders in 1933. After Machado was deposed there was a short, confused interregnum.

About six months later still, in September 1933, there was a successful mutiny by enlisted soldiers and non-commissioned officers, taking the lower ranks of the Cuban Army to power. A key figure in the process was [[Fulgencio Batista]], an army sergeant holding a key post as a telegraph officer. Batista, with his straight Taíno hair and very dark skin, often lightened in later photographs, was known as &quot;El Mulato Lindo&quot;. He was the first and only mulatto leader in Cuban history.&lt;ref&gt;Argote-Freyre, Frank. 2006. ''Fulgencio Batista: Volume 1, From revolutionary to strongman''.

===The 1940 constitution and the Batista era===
[[Image:Prio Socarras 1948.jpg|thumb|right|120px|President [[Carlos Prío Socarrás]] (left), with US president [[Harry S. Truman]] in Washington, 1948.]]

====The rise of Batista====
In 1940, Cuba had free and fair elections.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bethell-Cuba&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sweig-Inside&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Inside the Cuban Revolution|author=Julia E. Sweig|isbn=9780674016125|year=2004|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Mass.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Batista, endorsed by Communists,&lt;ref name=&quot;Dominquez-Cuba&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cuba|author=Jorge I. Domínguez}}&lt;/ref&gt; won the election. Communists attacked the anti-Batista opposition, saying that Ramón Grau and others were &quot;fascists&quot;, &quot;reactionaries&quot;, and &quot;[[Trotskyist]]s&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dominquez-Cuba&quot;/&gt; The [[Constitution of Cuba|1940 Constitution]], which Julia E. Sweig describes as extraordinarily [[progressivist]], was adopted by Batista administration.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bethell-Cuba&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cuba|author=Leslie Bethell|isbn=9780521436823|year=1993|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sweig-Inside&quot;/&gt; The constitution denied Batista the possibility to run consecutively in the 1944 election.

Rather than endorsing Batista's hand-picked successor Carlos Zayas, the Cuban people elected Dr. [[Ramón Grau San Martín]] in 1944. A populist physician, who had briefly held the presidency in the 1933 revolutionary process, Grau made a deal with [[labor union]]s to continue Batista's pro-labour policies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dominquez-Cuba&quot;/&gt; Grau's administration coincided with the end of World War II, and he inherited an economic boom as sugar production and prices rose. He inaugurated a program of public works and school construction. Social security benefits were increased, and economic development and agricultural production were encouraged. But increased prosperity brought increased corruption. [[Nepotism]] and favoritism flourished, and urban violence, a legacy of the early 1930s, reappeared now with tragic proportions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.answers.com/topic/grau-san-mart-n-ram-n&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dominquez-Cuba&quot;/&gt; The country was also steadily gaining a reputation as a base for organized crime, with the [[Havana Conference]] of 1946 seeing leading Mafia mobsters descend upon the city.&lt;ref&gt;[http://crimemagazine.com/havana.htm Havana Conference&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Grau was followed by [[Carlos Prío Socarrás]], also elected democratically, but whose government was tainted by increasing corruption and violent incidents among political factions. Around the same time [[Fidel Castro]] had become a public figure at the University of Havana. [[Eduardo Chibás]] was the leader of the [[Partido Ortodoxo]] (Orthodox Party), a liberal democratic group, who was widely expected to win in 1952 on an anticorruption platform. Chibás committed suicide before he could run for the presidency, and the opposition was left without its major leader.

Taking advantage of the opportunity, Batista, who was running for president in the 1952 elections, but was only expected to get a small minority of votes, seized power in an almost bloodless coup three months before the election was to take place. President Prío did nothing to stop the coup, and was forced to leave the island. Due to the corruption of the past two administrations, the general public reaction to the coup was somewhat accepting at first. However, Batista soon encountered stiff opposition when he temporarily suspended the balloting and the constitution, and attempted to rule by decree. Elections were held in 1953 and Batista was elected. Opposition parties mounted a blistering campaign, and continued to do so, using the Cuban free press during all of Batista's tenure in office.

====Economic expansion====
Although Batista was intent on lining his pockets, Cuba did flourish economically during his regime. Cuba's wages were among the world's highest;&lt;ref name=&quot;gonzalez&quot;/&gt; according to the [[International Labor Organization]], the average industrial salary in Cuba was the world's 8th highest in 1958, and the average agricultural wage was higher than in [[developed nations]] such as [[Denmark]], [[West Germany]], [[Belgium]], or [[France]].&lt;ref name=&quot;gonzalez&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Secret Fidel Castro|author=Servando Gonzalez}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;beforecastro&quot;/&gt; Although a third of the population still lived in poverty, Cuba was one of the five most developed countries in Latin America.&lt;ref name=&quot;heroic&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|title=The Cuban revolution at 50: Heroic myth and prosaic failure|date=30 December 2008|publisher=The Economist|url=http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12851254}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only 44% of the population was rural.&lt;ref name=&quot;Paterson-Contesting&quot;/&gt;

[[Gross domestic product]] per capita was already about equal to that of [[Italy]] and significantly higher than that of countries such as [[Japan]] at the time, although Cuba's GDP was still only a sixth as large as that of the US.&lt;ref name=&quot;gonzalez&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;garcia&quot;/&gt; According to the United Nations at the time, &quot;one feature of the Cuban social structure [was] a large middle class&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;garcia&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Andy Garcia's Thought Crime|url=http://frontpagemagazine.com/Articles/Read.aspx?GUID=7F7FD12F-91C7-4DD3-8630-DA804216B600}}&lt;/ref&gt; Labour rights were also favourable - an [[eight-hour day]] had been established in 1933, long before other countries, and Cuban workers had a months's paid holiday, nine days' sick leave with pay, and six weeks' holiday before and after [[childbirth]].&lt;ref name=&quot;unnecessary&quot;/&gt;

Cuba also had Latin America's highest per capita consumption rates of meat, vegetables, cereals, automobiles, telephones and radios.&lt;ref name=&quot;beforecastro&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;unnecessary&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Cuba: The Unnecessary Revolution|url=http://www.neoliberalismo.com/unnecesary.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lewis&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|[http://books.google.com/books?id{{=}}LAvw-YXm4TsC&amp;pg{{=}}PA186 186]}} Televisions per capita was the fifth highest in the world, and despite Cuba's small size, it had the world's 8th highest number of radio stations (160). According to the United Nations, Cubans read 58 daily newspapers during the late 1950s, with more newspapers being read only in three much more populous countries: [[Brazil]], [[Argentina]] and [[Mexico]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cubafacts43&quot;/&gt; People migrated to Havana at fast pace. Havana was the world's fourth most expensive city at the time,&lt;ref name=&quot;Bethell-Cuba&quot;/&gt; and had more [[cinemas]] than New York.&lt;ref name=&quot;heroic&quot;/&gt; The economy could not always keep up with demand, however - under Batista, Cuba had the highest telephone penetration in Latin America, but thousands of citizens were still waiting to be connected to the phone network, causing mass frustration.&lt;ref name=&quot;Paterson-Contesting&quot;/&gt;

Moreover, Cuba's health service was remarkably developed. It had one of the highest numbers of doctors per capita - more than in the [[United Kingdom]] - and the third-lowest adult mortality rate in the world. According to the [[World Health Organization]], the island had the lowest [[infant mortality rate]] in Latin America and the 13th lowest in the world - better than in [[France]], [[Belgium]], [[West Germany]], [[Israel]], [[Japan]], [[Austria]], [[Italy]], [[Spain]], and [[Portugal]].&lt;ref name=&quot;beforecastro&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Cuba Before Fidel Castro|url=http://www.fiu.edu/~fcf/cubaprecastro21698.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;comparison&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lanic.utexas.edu/la/ca/cuba/asce/cuba8/30smith.pdf|format=PDF|title=Renaissance and decay: A comparison of socioeconomic indicators in pre-castro and current-day Cuba|author=Kirby Smith and Hugo Llorens|accessdate=2009-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;stuckoncastro&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.reason.com/news/show/125095.html|title=Still Stuck on Castro - How the press handled a tyrant's farewell}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Education spending in Cuba was, relatively, the highest in Latin America.&lt;ref name=&quot;beforecastro&quot;/&gt; Cuba had the 4th highest literacy rate in the region at almost 80% according to the United Nations, higher than that of Spain.&lt;ref name=&quot;cubafacts43&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ctp.iccas.miami.edu/FACTS_Web/Cuba%20Facts%20Issue%2043%20December.htm|title=Cuba facts issue 43|date=December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;comparison&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;stuckoncastro&quot;/&gt;

====Stagnation and dissatisfaction====
However, the United States was the frame of reference, not Latin America.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bethell-Cuba&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Paterson-Contesting&quot;/&gt; Cubans travelled to America, read American newspapers, listened to American radio, watched American television, and were attracted to American culture.&lt;ref name=&quot;Paterson-Contesting&quot;/&gt; Middle class Cubans dreamed of the American economy and the gap between Cuba and the US increasingly frustrated many in the mid-1950s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bethell-Cuba&quot;/&gt; The middle class became increasingly dissatisfied with the administration, while labour unions supported Batista until the very end.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bethell-Cuba&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dominquez-Cuba&quot;/&gt;

There were large income disparities that were a result of the fact that Cuba's unionized workers enjoyed perhaps the most extensive privileges in Latin America.&lt;ref name=&quot;baklanoff&quot;/&gt; Cuban labour unions had established limitations on mechanization and even bans on dismissals.&lt;ref name=&quot;unnecessary&quot;/&gt; The labour unions' privileges were obtained in large measure &quot;at the cost of the unemployed and the peasants&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;baklanoff&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Cuba on the eve of the socialist transition: A reassessment of the backwardness-stagnation thesis|author=Eric N. Baklanoff|format=PDF|journal=Cuba in Transition|url=http://lanic.utexas.edu/la/ca/cuba/asce/cuba8/31baklanoff.pdf|accessdate=2009-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cuba's labour regulations ultimately caused economic stagnation. Hugh Thomas asserts that &quot;militant unions succeded in maintaining the position of unionized workers and, consequently, made it difficult for capital to improve efficiency.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas-Cuba&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cuba, The Pursuit of Freedom|author=Hugh Thomas|page=1173)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1933 and 1958, Cuba increased economic regulation enormously.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dominquez-Cuba&quot;/&gt; The regulation led to declining investment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dominquez-Cuba&quot;/&gt; The [[World Bank]] also complained that the Batista administration raised the tax burden without assessing its impact. Unemployment was high; many [[university]] graduates could not find jobs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dominquez-Cuba&quot;/&gt; After its earlier meteroic rise, the Cuban gross domestic product grew at only 1% annually on average between 1950 and 1958.&lt;ref name=&quot;Paterson-Contesting&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Contesting Castro|author=Thomas G. Paterson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Cuban revolution==
{{Main|Cuban Revolution}}

[[Fidel Castro]], a young lawyer from a rich family, who was running for a seat in the Chamber of Representatives for the Partido Ortodoxo, circulated a petition to depose Batista's government on the grounds that it had illegitimately suspended the electoral process. However, the petition was not acted upon by the courts. On 26 July 1953 Castro led a historic attack on the [[Moncada Barracks]] near [[Santiago de Cuba]], but failed. Many soldiers were killed by Castro's forces. Castro was captured, tried and sentenced to 15&amp;nbsp;years in prison. However, he was released by the Batista government in 1956, when amnesty was given to many political prisoners, including the ones that assaulted the Moncada barracks. Castro subsequently went into exile in Mexico where he met [[Ernesto &quot;Che&quot; Guevara]]. While in Mexico, he organized the [[26th of July Movement]] with the goal of overthrowing Batista. A group of 82 men sailed to Cuba on board the yacht ''[[Granma (yacht)|Granma]]'', landing in the eastern part of the island in December 1956. Despite a pre-landing rising in Santiago by [[Frank Pais]] and his followers of the urban pro-Castro movement, most of Castro's men were promptly killed, dispersed or taken prisoner by Batista's forces.

Castro managed to escape to the [[Sierra Maestra]] mountains with about 12-17 effectives, aided by the urban and rural opposition, including Celia Sanchez and the bandits of Cresencio Perez's family, he began a guerrilla campaign against the regime. Castro's main forces supported by numerous poorly armed escopeteros, and with support from the well armed fighters of the [[Frank Pais]] urban organization who at times went to the mountains the rebel army grew more and more effective. The country was soon driven to chaos conducted in the cities by diverse groups of the anti-Batista resistance and notably a bloodily crushed rising by the Batista Navy personnel in Cienfuegos. At the same time, rival guerrilla groups in the Escambray Mountains also grew more and more effective. Castro attempted to arrange a general strike in 1958, but did not get support from Communists or labor unions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lewis&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Authoritarian regimes in Latin America|author=Paul H. Lewis}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=July 2009}}

United States imposed trade restrictions on the Batista administration and sent an envoy which attempted to persuade Batista to leave the country voluntarily.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bethell-Cuba&quot;/&gt; The middle class was dissatisfied with the unemployment and wanted to restore the 1940 constitution. Batista fled on 1 January 1959.

Castro took over. Within months of taking control, Castro moved to consolidate power by brutally marginalizing other resistance groups and figures and imprisoning and executing opponents and former supporters. As the revolution became more radical and continued its persecution of those who did not agree with its direction, hundreds of thousands of Cubans fled the island.

==Castro's Cuba==
===Politics===
Fidel Castro quickly purged political opponents from the administration. Loyalty to Castro became the primary criterion for all appointments.&lt;ref name=&quot;Staten-Cuba&quot;/&gt; Groups such as labour unions were made illegal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lewis&quot;/&gt;{{Page needed|date=July 2009}}

By the end of 1960, all opposition newspaper had been closed down and all radio and television stations were in state control.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lewis&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|[http://books.google.com/books?id{{=}}LAvw-YXm4TsC&amp;pg{{=}}PA189 189]}} Teachers and professors were purged.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lewis&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|[http://books.google.com/books?id{{=}}LAvw-YXm4TsC&amp;pg{{=}}PA189 189]}} The Communist Party strengthened its one-party rule, with Castro as the supreme leader.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lewis&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|[http://books.google.com/books?id{{=}}LAvw-YXm4TsC&amp;pg{{=}}PA189 189]}} Moderates were arrested.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lewis&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|[http://books.google.com/books?id{{=}}LAvw-YXm4TsC&amp;pg{{=}}PA189 189]}} Fidel's brother Raul Castro became the commander of the army.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lewis&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|[http://books.google.com/books?id{{=}}LAvw-YXm4TsC&amp;pg{{=}}PA189 189]}} In September 1960, the [[neighborhood watch]] networks known as [[committees for the defense of the revolution]] (CDR) were created.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lewis&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|[http://books.google.com/books?id{{=}}LAvw-YXm4TsC&amp;pg{{=}}PA189 189]}}

In July 1961, two years after the 1959 Revolution, the ''[[Integrated Revolutionary Organizations]] (IRO)'' was formed by the merger of Fidel Castro's [[26th of July Movement]], the ''[[Popular Socialist Party (Cuba)|Popular Socialist Party]]'' led by [[Blas Roca]] and the ''[[Revolutionary Directory March 13th]]'' led by [[Faure Chomón]]. On March 26, 1962 the IRO became the ''United Party of the Cuban Socialist Revolution'' (PURSC) which, in turn, became the [[Communist Party of Cuba]] on October 3, 1965 with Castro as [[General Secretary|First Secretary]]. As of 2011, the Communist Party remains the only recognized political party in Cuba. Other parties, though not illegal, are unable to campaign or conduct any activities on the island that could be deemed [[counter-revolutionary]].

===Break with the United States===
====Castro's resentment of US influence====
The US recognized the Castro government on 7 January, only six days after Batista fled Cuba. President Eisenhower sent a new ambassador, [[Philip Bonsal]], to replace [[Earl Smith]], who had been close to Batista. The [[Eisenhower administration]], in agreement with the [[US media]] and the [[US Congress|Congress]] (Republicans and Democrats alike), did this with the assumption that “Cuba must remain in the US sphere of influence”. If Castro accepted these parameters, he would be allowed to stay in power. Otherwise he would be overthrown.&lt;ref&gt;Gleijeses, Piero: Conflicting Missions, Havana, Washington and Africa, 1959–1976, The University of North Carolina Press, 2002, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the opponents of Batista there were many who wanted to accommodate the US. However, Castro belonged to a faction who, to the astonishment of Eisenhower and many [[North Americans]], was repulsed by US domination and paternalism. Castro did not forgive the US supply of arms to Batista during the revolution. On 5 June 1958, he wrote: “The Americans are going to pay dearly for what they are doing. When the war is over, I’ll start a much longer and bigger war of my own: the war I’m going to fight against them. That will be my true destiny.”&lt;ref&gt;Castro to Celia Sanches, 5 June 1958 in Franqui: Diary, p. 338.&lt;/ref&gt; (The US had stopped supplies to Batista in March 1958, but left its Military Advisory Group in Cuba&lt;ref&gt;Paterson in: Contesting Castro, p. 242.&lt;/ref&gt;). Thus, Castro had no intention to bow to the US. “Even though he did not have a clear blueprint of the Cuba he wanted to create, Castro dreamed of a sweeping revolution that would uproot his country’s oppressive socioeconomic structure and of a Cuba that would be free of the United States”.&lt;ref&gt;Quotations from “Unofficial Visit of Prime Minister Castro of Cuba to Washington – A Tentative Evaluation”, enclosed in Herter to Eisenhower, April 23, 1959, jFRUS 1958–60, 6:483, and Special NIE in: “The Situation in the Caribbean through 1959”, 30 June 1959, p. 3, NSA&lt;/ref&gt;

====Breakdown of relations====
Only six months after Castro seized power, the Eisenhower administration began to plot his ouster. The [[United Kingdom]] was persuaded to cancel the sale of [[Hawker Hunter]] [[fighter aircraft]] to Cuba.

At the same meeting [[Roy R. Rubottom, Jr.]], [[Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs|Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs]], summarized the evolution of [[Cuba–United States relations]] since January: &quot;The period from January to March might be characterized as the honeymoon period of the Castro government. In April a downward trend in US-Cuban relations had been evident…In June we had reached the decision that it was not possible to achieve our objectives with Castro in power and had agreed to undertake the program referred to by Mr. Merchant. In July and August we had been busy drawing up a program to replace Castro. However some US companies reported to us during this time that they were making some progress in negotiations, a factor that caused us to slow the implementation of our program. The hope expressed by these companies did not materialize. October was a period of clarification…   On 31 October in agreement with [[Central Intelligence Agency]], the Department had recommended to the President approval of a program along the lines referred to by Mr. Merchant. The approved program authorized us to support elements in Cuba opposed to the Castro government while making Castro’s downfall seem to be the result of his own mistakes.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;NSC meeting, 14 January 1960, FRUS 1958-60, 6:742–43.&lt;/ref&gt; “It was probably as part of this program that Cuban exiles mounted sea borne raids against Cuba from [[Florida|US territory]] and that unidentified planes attacked economic targets on the island, leading the US to warn Washington that the population was “becoming aroused” against the United States”.&lt;ref&gt;Braddock to SecState, Havana, 1 February 1960, FRUS 1958–60, 6:778.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gleijeses, Piero in: Conflicting Missions, Havana, Washington and Africa, 1959–1976, The University of North Carolina Press, 2002, pp. 14–5.&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1960, CIA Chief [[Allen Dulles]] proposed to sabotage sugar refineries on Cuba. Eisenhower considered such undertakings timely and felt that more ambitious programs should be implemented. In his view “it was probably now the time to move against Castro in a positive and aggressive way which went beyond pure harassment”. He asked the CIA to develop an enlarged program which was presented in March 1960.&lt;ref&gt;Gray (Eisenhower’s special assistant for national security affairs) to Wilson (assistant director, DDEL), 3 December 1974, p. 1, Gray Papers, box 2, DDEL.&lt;/ref&gt; This program led to the invasion in the Bay of Pigs.&lt;ref&gt;Kornbluh: Bay of Pigs.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blight and Kornbluh in: Politics&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vandenbroucke in: Perilous Options, p. 9-50&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bissell: Reflections, pp. 152–204&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1960, the [[France|French]] ship ''[[La Coubre]]'' was blown up in [[Havana Harbor]] as it unloaded munitions, killing dozens.

Relations between the United States and Cuba deteriorated rapidly as the Cuban government, in reaction to the refusal of [[Royal Dutch Shell]], [[Standard Oil]] and [[Texaco]] to refine [[petroleum]] from the [[Soviet Union]] in Cuban refineries under their control, took control of those refineries in July 1960. The Eisenhower administration promoted a [[boycott]] of Cuba by [[oil companies]], to which Cuba responded by nationalizing the refineries in August 1960. Both sides continued to escalate the dispute. Cuba expropriated more US-owned properties, notably those belonging to the [[ITT Corporation|International Telephone and Telegraph Company]] (ITT) and the [[United Fruit Company]].

In the Castro government’s first [[agrarian reform]] law, on 17 May 1959, it sought to limit the size of land holdings, and to distribute that land to small farmers in &quot;Vital Minimum&quot; tracts.

====Formal disconnection====
The US broke diplomatic relations on 3 January 1961 and imposed the [[US embargo against Cuba]] on 3 February 1962.

The [[Organization of American States]], under pressure from the United States, suspended Cuba's membership in the body on 22 January 1962, and the [[United States Government|US Government]] banned all US-Cuban trade a couple of weeks later on 7 February. The Kennedy administration extended this on 8 February 1963 making travel, financial and commercial transactions by US citizens to Cuba illegal.&lt;ref&gt;Priestland, Jane (editor) 2003 British Archives on Cuba: Cuba under Castro 1959-1962. Archival Publications International Limited, 2003, London ISBN 1-903008-20-4&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2009, US President [[Barack Obama]] expressed his intention to relax the existing travel restrictions by making it legal for Americans to travel to Cuba. However, on September 2, 2010, Obama extended the embargo through September 14, 2011, determining that the embargo &quot;is in the national interest of the United States.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Presidential Memorandum-Continuation of Authorities Under the Trading With the Enemy Act: http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2010/09/02/presidential-memorandum-continuation-authorities-under-trading-with-enem&lt;/ref&gt;

The embargo is still in effect {{As of|2011|lc=on}}, although some [[humanitarian]] trade in food and medicines is now allowed. At first, the embargo did not extend to other countries and Cuba traded with most [[Europe]]an, [[Asia]]n and Latin American countries and especially [[Canada]]. But now the United States pressures other nations and US companies with foreign subsidiaries to restrict trade with Cuba. Also, the [[Helms-Burton Act]] of 1996 makes it very difficult for companies doing business with Cuba to also do business in the United States, forcing internationals to choose between the two.

The '''Bay of Pigs Invasion''' (known as ''La Batalla de Girón'' in Cuba), was an unsuccessful attempt by a U.S.-trained force of [[Cuban exile]]s to invade southern Cuba with support from U.S. government armed forces to overthrow the Cuban government of [[Fidel Castro]]. The plan was launched in April 1961, less than three months after [[John F. Kennedy]] assumed the presidency in the [[United States]]. The Cuban armed forces, trained and equipped by [[Eastern Bloc]] nations, defeated the exile combatants in three days. The strained [[Cuban-American relations]] were exacerbated the following year by the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]].

===The Cuban missile crisis===
{{Main|Cuban missile crisis}}
Tensions between the two governments peaked again during the October 1962 [[Cuban missile crisis]]. The United States had a much larger arsenal of long-range nuclear weapons than the Soviet Union, as well as medium-range ballistic missiles ([[MRBM]]s) in Turkey, whereas the Soviet Union had a large stockpile of medium-range nuclear weapons which were primarily located in Europe. Cuba agreed to let the Soviets secretly place SS-4 ''Sandal'' and SS-5 ''Skean'' MRBMs on their territory. Reports from inside Cuba to exile sources questioned the need for large amounts of ice going to rural areas&lt;!-- apparently the ships were reported as carrying ice? need source --&gt;, which led to the discovery of the missiles, confirmed by [[Lockheed U-2]] photos. The United States responded by establishing a cordon in international waters to stop Soviet ships from bringing in more missiles (designated a [[quarantine]] rather than a [[blockade]] to avoid issues with [[international law]]). At the same time, Castro was getting a little too extreme for the liking of Moscow, so at the last moment the Soviets called back their ships. In addition, they agreed to remove the missiles already there in exchange for an agreement that the United States would not invade Cuba. Only after the fall of the Soviet Union was it revealed that another part of the agreement was the removal of US missiles from Turkey. It also turned out that some submarines that the US Navy blocked were carrying nuclear missiles and that communication with Moscow was tenuous, effectively leaving the decision of firing the missiles at the discretion of the captains of those submarines. In addition, following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the Russian government revealed that FROGs (Free Rocket Over Ground) armed with nuclear warheads and [[Ilyushin Il-28]] ''Beagle'' bombers armed with nuclear bombs had also been deployed in Cuba.

===Military build-up===
In the 1961 [[New Year's Day]] parade, the Communist administration exhibited Soviet tanks and other weapons.&lt;ref name=&quot;Staten-Cuba&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=The history of Cuba|author=Clifford L. Staten}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1982, Cuba possessed the second largest armed forces in Latin America, second only to [[Brazil]], though it was thought not to have the ability to invade another nation (apart from perhaps small Caribbean nations).&lt;ref name=&quot;cubamilitary&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|format=PDF|url=http://www.disam.dsca.mil/pubs/Vol%205-2/Cuban.pdf|title=CUBAN ARMED FORCES AND THE SOVIET MILITARY PRESENCE|accessdate=2009-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Repressions===

[[Military Units to Aid Production]] or UMAP’s (Unidades Militares para la Ayuda de Producción) ([[forced labor]] [[concentration camp]]s) were established in 1965 as a way to eliminate alleged &quot;[[bourgeois]]&quot; and &quot;[[counter-revolutionary]]&quot; values in the Cuban population. In July 1968 the name &quot;UMAP&quot; was erased and paperwork associated with the UMAP was destroyed. The camps continued as &quot;Military Units&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;castrogenocideplan&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.amigospais-guaracabuya.org/oagaq003.php|title=UMAP: Castro's genocide plan|author=Agustín Blázquezwith the collaboration of Jaums Sutton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Emigration===
{{Main|Cuban exile}}

The establishment of a [[socialist]] system in Cuba led to the fleeing of many hundreds of thousands of upper- and middle-class Cubans to the United States and other countries since Castro's rise to power.

By 1961, thousands of Cubans had fled Cuba for the United States. On 22 March an exile council was formed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bethell-Cuba&quot;/&gt; After defeating the Communist regime, the council planned to form a provisional government in which [[José Miró Cardona]] (who had become a noted leader in the civil opposition to President Fulgencio Batista) would have served as the temporary president until elections.

From 1959 through 1993, some 1.2&amp;nbsp;million Cubans (about 10% of the current population) left the island for the United States,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.census.gov/Press-Release/www/releases/archives/facts_for_features_special_editions/000797.html US Census Press Releases&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; often by sea in small boats and fragile rafts. In the early years a number of those who could claim dual Spanish-Cuban citizenship left for [[Spain]]. Over time a number of [[Cuban Jews]] were allowed to emigrate to [[Israel]] after quiet negotiations; the majority of the 10,000 or so Jews who were in Cuba in 1959 have left. After the collapse of the Soviet Union many Cubans now reside in a diverse number of countries, some ending up in countries of the [[European Union]]. A large number of Cubans live in [[Mexico]] and [[Canada]].

One major exception to the embargo was made on 6 November 1965 when Cuba and the United States formally agreed to start an airlift for Cubans who wanted to go to the United States. The first of these so-called [[Freedom Flights]] left Cuba on 1 December 1965 and by 1971 over 250,000 Cubans had flown to the United States. In 1980, another 125,000 came to US during six-months period in the [[Mariel boat lift]], some of them criminals and people with psychiatric diagnoses. It was discovered that the Cuban government was using the event to rid Cuba of the unwanted segments of its society. Currently, there is an immigration lottery allowing 20,000 Cubans seeking political asylum to go to the United States legally every year.

The closest points between Key West and Cuba are at a distance of ninety-four statue miles apart.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_West,_Florida&lt;/ref&gt; The ocean separating the two destinations is known for its changing currents and high concentrations of sharks. [[Volusia County]] of Florida neighbors the Atlantic Ocean and is considered the &quot;Shark Capital of the World&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://volusia.org/beach/shark_facts.htm Shark Facts&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, a thousand or more Cuban natives take the risk of traveling by small raft or boat to [[Key West]], the southern most part of the continental US.

===Cuban involvement in Third World conflicts===
From the very beginning the Cuban Revolution defined itself as [[internationalist]] and focused on the whole world. Thus, out of this idealism and also as a strategy for survival, already one year after the victory of revolution on Cuba the country took on civil and military assignments in the [[southern hemisphere]]. Although still a third world country itself Cuba supported African, Central American and Asian countries in the fields of military development, health and education. These “overseas adventures” not only irritated the USA but quite often were a “major headache” for Cuba's ostensible allies in the [[Kremlin]].&lt;ref&gt;Jim Lobe http://www.strategypage.com/militaryforums/50-9.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Sandinista National Liberation Front|Sandinista]] insurgency in [[Nicaragua]], which lead to the demise of the [[Somoza]] dictatorship in 1979, was openly supported by Cuba. However, it was on the African continent where Cuba was most active, supporting a total of 17 liberation movements or leftist governments, in countries including [[Angola]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Guinea-Bissau]] and [[Mozambique]]. Its Angolan involvement was particularly intense and noteworthy, ultimately assisting the Marxist-Leninist [[MPLA]] to victory in the [[Angolan Civil War]].

====Angola====
Cuba's [[Cuba in Angola|involvement in Angola]] began in the 1960s when relations were established with the leftist Movement for the Popular Liberation of Angola ([[MPLA]]). The MPLA was one of three organisations struggling to liberate Angola from Portugal, the other two being [[UNITA]] and the [[FNLA]]. In August and October 1975, South African Defence Forces (SADF) invaded Angola in support of the UNITA and FNLA. On 5 November 1975, without consulting the [[USSR]], the Cuban government opted for an all out intervention with combat troops ([[Operation Carlota]]) in support of the MPLA.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;France 2006&quot;&gt;“Une Odyssee Africaine”  (France, 2006, 59mn) directed by: Jihan El Tahri&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987-1988, South Africa again sent military forces to Angola to stop an advance of Angolan government forces (FAPLA) against UNITA leading to the [[Battle of Cuito Cuanavale]], and again, without consulting the USSR, Cuba stepped in.

Cuba directly participated in the negotiations between Angola and South Africa. On 22 December 1988 Angola, Cuba and South Africa signed the [[Tripartite Accord (Angola)|Tripartite Accord]] in New York arranging for the retreat of South Africa, the withdrawal of Cuban troops within 30&amp;nbsp;months and the implementation of the 10-year old [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 435|UN Security Council Resolution 435]] for the independence of [[Namibia]]. The Cuban intervention, for a short time, turned Cuba into a “global player” in the midst of the [[Cold War]]. It ended with the independence of [[Namibia]] and sounded the bell for the decline of the [[Apartheid]] regime in South Africa. The withdrawal of the Cubans ended 13&amp;nbsp;years of military presence in Angola. At the same time they removed their troops from Pointe Noire [[Republic of the Congo]] and [[Ethiopia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;France 2006&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2886.htm Cuba (11/07)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

====North Africa====
As early as 1961, Cuba supported the [[FLN]] in [[Algeria]] against [[France]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Gleijeses, Piero: Conflicting Missions: Havana, Washington, and Africa, (The University of North Carolina Press)&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after Algerian independence, [[Morocco]] started a border dispute in October 1963 in which Cuba sent troops to help Algeria (see: [[Sand War]]). From a Memorandum of 20 October 1963 by Major [[Raúl Castro]], it can be seen that great importance was attached to the decent behaviour of the troops, with strict instructions being given on their proper conduct during foreign interventions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB67/gleijeses10.pdf (Document from the Centro de Informacion de la Defensa de las Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias, CIDFAR, [Information Centre of the Revolutionary Armed Forces])&lt;/ref&gt;

====Congo====
In 1965 Cuba supported the [[Simba Rebellion]] of adherents of [[Lumumba]] in Congo-Leopoldville (today the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; Among the insurgents was also [[Laurent-Désiré Kabila]] who, 30&amp;nbsp;years later, would overthrow long-time dictator [[Mobutu]]. This secret Cuban mission turned out to be a complete failure.&lt;ref&gt;Ernesto Che Guevara: &quot;The African Dream&quot; The Diaries of the Revolutionary War in the Congo. With an Introduction by Richard Gott (New York: Grove Press, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ethiopia====
Fidel Castro was a friend of the [[Marxist-Leninist]] dictator [[Mengistu Haile Mariam]], whose regime killed hundreds of thousands during the [[Red Terror (Ethiopia)|Ethiopian Red Terror]] of the late 1970s and who was later convicted of [[genocide]] and [[crimes against humanity]]. Castro backed Mengistu Haile Mariam even when the latter had a war with the [[Somalia]]n Marxist-Leninist dictator [[Siad Barre]].&lt;ref name=&quot;westad&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Superpower diplomacy in the Horn of Africa|author=Samuel M. Makinda}}&lt;/ref&gt; Castro explained this to [[Erich Honecker]], communist dictator of [[East Germany]], by saying that Siad Barre was &quot;above all a chauvinist&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;westad&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=The global Cold War|author=Odd Arne Westad}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Escalation of foreign interventions====
In the 1970s and 1980s Cuba stepped up its military presence abroad, especially in Africa. It had up to 50,000 men stationed in Angola, 24,000 in [[Ethiopia]] and hundreds in other countries. Cuban forces played a key role in the [[Ogaden War]] 1977/78 between Ethiopia and [[Somalia]] and kept a substantial garrison stationed in Ethiopia. In the [[Mozambican Civil War]] beginning in 1977 and in Congo-Brazzaville (today [[Republic of the Congo]]) Cubans acted as advisors. Congo-Brazzaville acted as a supply base for the Angola mission.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

===Cooperation between Cuban and Soviet intelligence services===
As early as September 1959, Valdim Kotchergin (or Kochergin), a [[KGB]] agent, was seen in Cuba.&lt;ref&gt;(British Foreign Office. Chancery American Department, Foreign Office, London 2 September 1959 (2181/59) to British Embassy Havana classified as restricted Released 2000 by among British Foreign Office papers FOREIGN OFFICES FILES FOR CUBA Part 1: Revolution in Cuba “in our letter 1011/59 May 6 we mentioned that a Russian workers' delegation had been invited to participate in the May Day celebrations here, but had been delayed.

The Soviet Union saw the new revolutionary government in Cuba as an excellent proxy agent in areas of the world where Soviet involvement was not popular on a local level. [[Nikolai Leninov]], the KGB Chief in [[Mexico City]], was one of the first Soviet officials to recognize [[Fidel Castro]]'s potential as a revolutionary and urged the Soviet Union to strengthen ties with the new Cuban leader. The USSR saw Cuba as having far more appeal with new revolutionary movements, western intellectuals, and members of the [[New Left]], given Cuba's perceived [[Goliath (Bible)|David and Goliath]] struggle against US &quot;imperialism&quot;. Shortly after the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] in 1963, 1,500 DI agents, including [[Che Guevara]], were invited to the USSR for intensive training in intelligence operations.

==Cuba after the Soviet Union==
{{See also|Special Period}}
{{Ref improve section|date=June 2006}}
Starting from the mid-1980s and the collapse of Soviet Union,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cuba's second economy|author=Jorge F. Pérez-López}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cuba experienced a crisis referred to as the &quot;[[Special Period]]&quot;. In 2008, Fidel Castro transferred power to his brother, [[Raúl Castro]]. Cuba remains one of the few [[socialist state]]s in the world. Although contacts between Cubans and foreign visitors were made legal in 1997,&lt;ref name=&quot;rennie&quot;&gt;Rennie, David. [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2002/06/08/wcuba08.xml Cuba 'apartheid' as Castro pulls in the tourists], ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', 08/06/2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=corbett&gt;{{Cite book|title=This Is Cuba: An Outlaw Culture Survives|first=Ben|last=Corbett|year=2004|publisher=Westview Press|isbn=0813338263|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Censorship in Cuba|extensive censorship]] has isolated it from the rest of the world.

When the Soviet Union broke up in late 1991, a major boost to Cuba's economy was lost, leaving it essentially paralyzed because of the economy's narrow basis, focused on just a few products with just a few buyers. Also, supplies (including oil) almost dried up. Over 80% of Cuba's trade was lost and living conditions worsened. A [[Special Period|&quot;Special Period in Peacetime&quot;]] was declared, which included cutbacks on transport and electricity and even food rationing. In response, the United States tightened up its trade embargo, hoping it would lead to Castro's downfall. But Castro tapped into a pre-revolutionary source of income and opened the country to tourism, entering into several joint ventures with foreign companies for hotel, agricultural and industrial projects. As a result, the use of US dollars was legalized in 1994, with special stores being opened which only sold in dollars. There were two separate economies, dollar-economy and the peso-economy, creating a social split in the island because those in the dollar-economy made much more money (as in the tourist-industry). However, in October 2004, the Cuban government announced an end to this policy: from November US dollars would no longer be legal tender in Cuba, but would instead be exchanged for [[Cuban convertible peso|convertible pesos]] (since April 2005 at the exchange rate of $1.08) with a 10% tax payable to the state on the exchange of US dollars cash — though not on other forms of exchange.

A [[Canadian Medical Association Journal]] paper states that &quot;The famine in Cuba during the Special Period was caused by political and economic factors similar to the ones that caused a famine in North Korea in the mid-1990s. Both countries were run by authoritarian regimes that denied ordinary people the food to which they were entitled when the public food distribution collapsed; priority was given to the elite classes and the military.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;cmaj&quot;/&gt; The government did not accept American donations of food, medicines and cash until 1993.&lt;ref name=&quot;cmaj&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=2474886|title=Health consequences of Cuba's Special Period|publisher=Canadian Medical Association Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cubans had to resort to eating anything they could find. In the Havana zoo, the [[peacock]]s, the [[american bison|buffalo]] and even the [[Rhea (bird)|rhea]] were reported to have disappeared.&lt;ref name=&quot;parrotdiplomacy&quot;/&gt; Cuban [[domestic cat]]s disappeared from streets to dinner tables.&lt;ref name=&quot;parrotdiplomacy&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=11792274|title=Parrot diplomacy|publisher=The Economist|date=24 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Extreme shortages of food and other goods as well as electrical blackouts led to a brief period of unrest, including numerous anti-government protests and widespread increases in crime. In response, the Cuban Communist party government formed hundreds of “rapid-action brigades” to confront protesters. According to the Communist Party daily, ''[[Granma (newspaper)|Granma]],'' &quot;delinquents and anti-social elements who try to create disorder and an atmosphere of mistrust and impunity in our society will receive a crushing reply from the people.&quot;

The [[Tugboat massacre]] in July 1994 was a massacre of fleeing Cubans.&lt;ref name=&quot;werlau-tugboatmassacre&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cubaarchive.org/13_DE_MARZO_TUGBOAT_MASSACRE.pdf|format=PDF|title=Cuba: The Tugboat Massacre of July 13, 1994|author=Maria C. Werlau|accessdate=2009-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thousands of Cubans protested in Havana and chanted &quot;Libertad!&quot; during the [[Maleconazo uprising]] on August 5, 1994. The regime's security forces dispersed them soon.&lt;ref name=&quot;cancubachange&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.journalofdemocracy.org/articles/gratis/Gutierrez-20-1.pdf|title=Can Cuba Change?|author=Carl Gershman and Orlando Gutierrez|journal=Journal of Democracy January 2009, Volume 20, Number 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; A paper published in the ''Journal of Democracy'' states this was the closest that the Cuban opposition could come to asserting itself decisively.&lt;ref name=&quot;cancubachange&quot;/&gt;

In 1997, a group led by [[Vladimiro Roca]], a decorated veteran of the [[Angola]]n war and the son of the founder of the [[Cuban Communist Party]], sent a petition, entitled ''La Patria es de Todos'' (&quot;the homeland belongs to all&quot;) to the Cuban general assembly requesting democratic and human rights reforms. As a result, Roca and his three associates were sentenced to jail, from which they were eventually released.

In 2001, a group of activists collected thousands of signatures for the [[Varela Project]], a petition requesting a referendum on the island's political process was openly supported by former US president [[Jimmy Carter]] during his historic 2002 visit to Cuba. The petition gathered sufficient signatures, but was rejected on an alleged technicality. Instead, a [[plebiscite]] was held in which it was formally proclaimed that Castro's brand of socialism would be perpetual.

In 2003, Castro cracked down on independent journalists and other dissidents, which became known as the &quot;[[Black Spring (Cuba)|Black Spring]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;longblackspring&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cpj.org/reports/2008/03/cuba-press-crackdown.php|title=Cuba's Long Black Spring|author=Carlos Lauria, Monica Campbell, and María Salazar|publisher=The Committee To Protect Journalists|date=18 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cpj.org/blog/2009/03/the-black-spring-of-2003-a-former-cuban-prisoner-s.php|title=Black Spring of 2003: A former Cuban prisoner speaks|publisher=The Committee to Protect Journalists}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=16771|title=Three years after &quot;black spring&quot; the independent press refuses to remain in the dark|publisher=The Reporters Without Borders}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rsf.org/IMG/pdf/Cuba_report.pdf|title=Cuba - No surrender by independent journalists, five years on from “black spring”|format=PDF|publisher=The Reporters Without Borders|date=March 2008|accessdate=2009-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government imprisoned 75 dissident thinkers, including 29 journalists,&lt;ref name=&quot;longblackspring&quot;/&gt; librarians, human rights activists and democracy activists, on the basis that they were acting as agents of the United States by accepting aid from the US government.

In 2006 Fidel Castro took ill and moved out of the public light and into a hospital, and in 2007 Raul Castro became Acting President. In a letter dated 18 February 2008, Castro announced that he would not accept the positions of president and commander in chief at the 24 February 2008 National Assembly meetings, saying &quot;I will not aspire nor accept—I repeat I will not aspire or accept—the post of President of the Council of State and Commander in Chief.&quot; See [[Fidel Castro]].

The '''economy of [[Cuba]]''' is a largely [[state (polity)|state]]-controlled, centrally [[planned economy]] overseen by the [[Cuba]]n government, though there remains significant foreign investment and private enterprise in Cuba. Most of the means of production are owned and run by the government, and most of the labor force is employed by the state. In the year 2000, public sector employment was 76% and private sector employment was 23% compared to the 1981 ratio of 91% to 8%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfamamerica.org/newsandpublications/publications/research_reports/art3670.html/pdfs/social_policy.pdf Social Policy at the Crossroads] Oxfam America Report&lt;/ref&gt; Capital investment is restricted and requires approval by the government. The Cuban government sets most prices and rations goods to citizens. In 2009, Cuba ranked 51st out of 182 with an [[Human Development Index|HDI]] of 0.863; remarkably high considering its GDP per capita only places it 95th.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hdrstats.undp.org/en/countries/country_fact_sheets/cty_fs_CUB.html] UNDP 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Cuba also significantly outperforms the rest of Latin America in terms of infant and child mortality, morbidity, educational attainment and an array of other social and health indicators.&lt;ref&gt;[http://multinationalmonitor.org/hyper/issues/1989/04/zimbalist.html] Multinationalmonitor&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950s, Cuba had a vibrant but extremely unequal economy, with large capital outflows to foreign investors.&lt;ref&gt;[Mehrotra, Santosh. (1997) Human Development in Cuba: Growing Risk of Reversal in Development with a Human Face: Experience in Social Achievement and Economic Growth Ed. Santosh Mehrotra and Richard Jolly, Clarendon Press, Oxford]&lt;/ref&gt; The country has made significant progress since the Revolution towards a more even distribution of income. Despite the economic embargo by the United States, the economy grew at a rate higher than the rest of Latin America until the collapse of the Soviet Union, its main trading partner. Between 1990 and 1993, Cuba's GDP declined by 33%.&lt;ref&gt;[Brundenius, Claes (2009) Revolutionary Cuba at 50: Growth with Equity revisited Latin American Perspectives Vol. 36 No. 2 March 2009 pp.31-48]&lt;/ref&gt; Yet Cuba has managed to retain levels of healthcare and education,&lt;ref&gt;[Ritter, A.R.M (2004) The Cuban Economy Pittsburgh, University of Pittsburgh Press]&lt;/ref&gt; and since 2000 the economy is rapidly recovering.&lt;ref name=&quot;Monitor&quot;&gt;http://multinationalmonitor.org/hyper/issues/1989/04/zimbalist.html&lt;/ref&gt; Cuba has a highly-developed service industry with one of the largest professional workforce in the world. Its number of doctors per capita is ranked #1 in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;Monitor&quot;/&gt;

Cubans receive low housing and transportation costs, free education, and health care and food subsidies.&lt;ref&gt;http://upsidedownworld.org/main/content/view/42/43/&lt;/ref&gt; Corruption is common, though far lower than in most other countries in Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last =Schweimler| first =Daniel| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/1311962.stm| title =Cuba's anti-corruption ministry| publisher =BBC News| accessdate =2006-07-09 | date=May 4, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Cuba prior to the Revolution had a one-crop economy whose domestic market was constricted. Its population was characterized by chronic unemployment and deep poverty. [[United States]] monopolies like Bethlehem Steel Corporation and Speyer and Company gained control over Cuba's national resources, from which they made huge profits. The banks and the country's entire financial system, all electric power production, and most industry was dominated by US capital. US monopolies owned 25 percent of the best land in Cuba, and more than 80 of all farm lands were occupied by sugar and livestock-raising latifundia. 90 percent of the country's raw sugar and tobacco exports was sent to the USA. Before the Revolution, most Cuban children were not included in the school system. There was almost no machine-building industry in Cuba.&lt;ref&gt;http://slovari.yandex.ru/dict/bse/article/00039/54700.htm?text=%D0%9A%D1%83%D0%B1%D0%B0&amp;encid=bse&amp;stpar3=1.1&lt;/ref&gt; 

87 percent of urban homes had electricity, but only 10 percent of rural homes did. Only 15 percent of rural homes had running water. Nearly half the rural population was illiterate, as was about 25 percent of the total population. Poverty and unemployment in the rural areas forced desperate residents to migrate to Havana, where there was high levels of crime and prostitution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=3BDH9FK6grMC&amp;pg=PA170&amp;dq=Cuba+poverty+batista&amp;ei=CcbrSq0iipCVBMypragM#v=onepage&amp;q=Cuba%20poverty%20batista&amp;f=false Bacardi and the long fight for Cuba: the biography of a cause By Tom Gjelten]&lt;/ref&gt; More than 40 percent of the Cuban workforce in 1958 was either underemployed or unemployed. Schools for blacks and mulattoes were vastly inferior with those for whites. Afro-Cubans had the worst living conditions and held the lowest paid jobs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=LjKoLe9jWKoC&amp;pg=PA8&amp;dq=Batista+cuba+unemployment+rate&amp;lr=&amp;ei=jcfrStDIIJqIlQSj66T9Cw#v=onepage&amp;q=Batista%20cuba%20unemployment%20rate&amp;f=false A contemporary Cuba reader: reinventing the Revolution By Philip Brenner]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Cuba ranked ahead of other countries in Latin America purely in average GDP, a third of the population lived in poverty.&lt;ref name=&quot;heroic&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=The Cuban revolution at 50: Heroic myth and prosaic failure|date=December 30, 2008|publisher=The Economist|url=http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12851254}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cuban Revolution===

Following the Cuban Revolution, the country made economic progress. In the period 1960-85, real income growth per capita averaged 3.1 percent per year, compared to 1.8 percent in the rest of Latin America. As a result of this growth, Cuba's per capita income in 1987 exceeded $3500, compared to only $2200 in the rest of Latin America.&lt;ref name=&quot;Monitor&quot;/&gt;

Unemployment in Cuba was minimal. Basic services for Cuban citizens have been maintained and improved. Lower income groups have experienced a rise in their wages and state-set prices have remained stable for Cubans.&lt;ref name=&quot;Monitor&quot;/&gt; President [[Raúl Castro]] has recently fired half-a-million workers from state-run economy to increase discipline. 

The share of agriculture in the GDP fell from 25 percent to only 10 percent in 1985. The country has had immense industrial growth, with manufacturing's share in the GDP rising from 23 to 36 percent. In the 1980s, with the exception of Argentina, Cuba's manufacturing share was the highest in Latin America. Branches of industry such as machinery and transport equipment have had significant growth, as their share of manufacturing output rose from under 2 percent in 1961 to over 20 percent in 1986.&lt;ref name=&quot;Monitor&quot;/&gt;

Between 1980 and 1985, Cuba introduced over 100 new products for export and had significant growth in exports of citrus fruits, steel products, gas stoves, paper products, transport material, radios, batteries, among others.&lt;ref name=&quot;Monitor&quot;/&gt;

Cuba also has succeeded in reducing poverty and equalizing the distribution of wealth. According to the United Nation's Economic Commission for Latin America, the decile ratio (share of total income for the top 10 percent of wage earners divided by the bottom 10 percent) in Latin America was 45 to 1, while that of Cuba was only 4 to 1. Cuba's income distribution was more than 10 times more equal than the rest of Latin America in the 1980s. Before the Revolution, Cuba's decile ratio was 65 to 1.&lt;ref name=&quot;Monitor&quot;/&gt;

During the Revolutionary period, Cuba was one of the few developing countries to provide foreign aid. Foreign aid began with the construction of six hospitals in Peru in the early 1970s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Monitor2&quot;&gt;http://multinationalmonitor.org/hyper/issues/1989/04/eckstein.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Foreign aid expanded later in the 1970s to the point where some 8000 Cubans worked in overseas assignments. Cubans built housing, roads, airports, schools, and other facilities in Angola, Ethiopia, Laos, Guinea, Tanzania, and other countries. By the end of 1985, 35,000 Cuban workers had helped build projects in some 20 Asian, African and Latin American countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Monitor2&quot;/&gt;

For Nicaragua, Cuba pledged to provide over $130 million worth of agricultural and machinery equipment, as well as some 4000 technicians, doctors, and teachers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Monitor2&quot;/&gt;

Some have attributed the Cuban economic success to Soviet subsidies. However, comparative economic data has shown that the amount of Soviet aid is comparable to that received by U.S.-backed regimes in the rest of Latin America, such as [[Chile]] under [[Augusto Pinochet]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Soviet aid to Cuba in per capita terms or as a share of national income is in line with the amount of Western aid to many Latin American countries.&quot; http://multinationalmonitor.org/hyper/issues/1989/04/zimbalist.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Special Period===
{{Main|Special Period}}
The Cuban economy is still recovering from a decline in [[gross domestic product]] of at least 35% between 1989 and 1993 due to the loss of 80% of its trading partners{{Clarify|date=August 2009}} and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[subsidy|subsidies]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/cuba/economy.htm&lt;/ref&gt; This era was referred to as the &quot;Special Period in Peacetime&quot; later shortened to &quot;[[Special Period]]&quot;. A [[Canadian Medical Association Journal]] paper states that &quot;The famine in Cuba during the Special Period was caused by political and economic factors similar to the ones that caused a famine in North Korea in the mid-1990s. Both countries were run by authoritarian regimes that denied ordinary people the food to which they were entitled when the public food distribution collapsed; priority was given to the elite classes and the military.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;cmaj&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=2474886|title=Health Consequences of Cuba's Special Period|publisher=Canadian Medical Association Journal|date=July 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cubans had to resort to eating anything they could find, from Havana Zoo animals to [[domestic cat]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;parrotdiplomacy&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=11792274|title=Parrot diplomacy|publisher=The Economist|date=July 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the collapse of socialism in the Soviet Union and other countries of the Eastern bloc, Cuba experienced economic difficulties, which led to a drop in calories per day from 3052 in 1989 to 2600 in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.treehugger.com/files/2006/08/cubas_organic_r.php&lt;/ref&gt;

The government has undertaken several reforms in recent years{{When|date=August 2009}} to stem excess [[liquidity]], increase labour incentives, and alleviate serious shortages of food, [[consumer good]]s, and services. To alleviate the economic crisis, the government introduced a few [[market economy|market]]-oriented reforms including opening to [[tourism]], allowing [[Foreign Direct Investment|foreign investment]], legalizing the [[U.S. dollar]], and authorizing self-employment for some 150 occupations. (This policy was later partially reversed, so that while the U.S. dollar is no longer accepted in businesses, it remains legal for Cubans to hold the currency.) These measures resulted in modest [[economic growth]]. The [[free market|liberalized]] [[agriculture|agricultural]] markets introduced in October 1994, at which state and private farmers sell above-quota production at [[free market]] prices, have broadened legal consumption alternatives and reduced [[black market]] prices.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

Government efforts to lower subsidies to unprofitable enterprises and to shrink the money supply caused the semi-official [[exchange rate]] for the [[Cuban peso]] to move from a peak of 120 to the dollar in the summer of 1994 to 21 to the dollar by year-end 1999. [[Living conditions]] in 1999 remained well below the 1989 level. New [[taxation|taxes]] introduced in 1996 have helped drive down the number of [[self-employment|self-employed]] workers from 208,000 in January 1996. {{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

Havana announced in 1995 that GDP declined by 35% during 1989-93, the result of lost Soviet aid and domestic inefficiencies. The drop in GDP apparently halted in 1994, when Cuba reported 0.7% growth, followed by increases of 2.5% in 1995 and 7.8% in 1996. Growth slowed again in 1997 and 1998 to 2.5% and 1.2% respectively. One of the key reasons given was the failure to notice that sugar production had become dramatically uneconomic. Reflecting on the Special period Cuban president [[Fidel Castro]] later admitted that many mistakes had been made, “The country had many economists and it is not my intention to criticize them, but I would like to ask why we hadn’t discovered earlier that maintaining our levels of sugar production would be impossible. The Soviet Union had collapsed, oil was costing $40 a barrel, sugar prices were at basement levels, so why did we not rationalize the industry?&quot; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mg.co.za/articlePage.aspx?articleid=270631&amp;area=/insight/insight__international/ Castro's new soldiers - Mail &amp; Guardian Online]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recovery===

Due to the continued growth of tourism, growth began in 1999 with a 6.2% increase in GDP {{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}. Growth in recent years has picked up significantly, with a growth in GDP of 11.8% in 2005 according to official Cuban information {{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}. In 2007 the Cuban economy grew by 7.5%, below the expected 10%, but higher than the Latin American average rate of growth. Accordingly, the cumulative growth in GDP since 2004 stood at 42.5 %.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.granma.cu/ingles/2008/enero/mar1/Cuban-Economy.html granma.cu - Cuban Economy Grows 7.5 Per Cent]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=40680 CHALLENGES 2007-2008: Cuban Economy in Need of Nourishment]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-Fidel reforms===
In 2007, Raúl Castro's administration hinted that the purchase of computers, DVD players and microwaves would become legal. However, monthly wages remain less than 20 U.S. dollars.&lt;ref name=&quot;iht&quot;/&gt; Mobile phones, which have been restricted to Cubans working for foreign companies and government officials, have become legalized. The new program could put phones in the hands of hundreds of thousands of Cubans.&lt;ref name=&quot;iht&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/03/28/news/Cuba-Cell-Phones.php|title=Cell phones, microwaves: New access to gizmos could deflect calls for deeper change in Cuba|date=March 28, 2008|publisher=International Herald Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Energy production==
Due to the reliance on declining Soviet era [[electricity]] generators, many areas of Cuba suffered{{When|date=August 2009}} frequent [[Power blackout|blackout]]s and [[power outage|brownouts]] for extended periods, creating additional pressure on society. To counter these problems, the government has put Cuba through an &quot;Energy Revolution&quot;, which has placed increased emphasis on the efficient use of electrical energy and more efficient, {{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} small-power generators linked in a synchronized network. The country has increased the number of solar- and wind-powered generators. Citizens are also encouraged to swap their old, electricity consumptive lamps with those of newer model to reduce consumption, which is also complemented with a new power tariff, which imposes economically punitive measurements on inefficient use of power.&lt;ref&gt;Laurie Guevara-Stone [http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2009/04/la-revolucion-energetica-cubas-energy-revolution &quot;La Revolucion Energetica: Cuba's Energy Revolution&quot;], Renewable Energy World International Magazine, September 28, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Though development was hampered by large-scale damage created by [[Hurricane Dennis]] and [[Hurricane Wilma]], which cut Cuba's electricity generation capacity by half in the areas most affected, Cuba now exceeds the government set demand in electricity production.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.granma.cu/INGLES/2007/octubre/juev4/41demanda-i.html&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|reason=Did this end the brownouts and blackouts?|date=August 2009}} Raul Castro told Cubans in his July 26 speech in 2007, that the [[Special Period]] is not yet over.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.granma.cu/INGLES/2007/julio/vier27/raul26.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government policies==
{{See|Rationing in Cuba|Corruption in Cuba|Sociolismo}}

[[Rationing in Cuba]] refers to the system of food distribution known in [[Cuba]] as the ''Libreta de Abastecimiento'' (&quot;Supplies booklet&quot;). The system establishes the [[ration]]s each person is allowed to buy through that system, and the frequency of supplies. It is rumoured that the rationing card, and the whole rationing system, will be abolished. The abolishment of the rationing system will become official at the next [[Communist Party of Cuba]]'s party congress set for April 2011.&lt;ref&gt;http://english.eluniversal.com/2010/11/19/en_ing_esp_chavez-supports-in_19A4751451.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

On top of rationing, the average wage at the end of 2005 was 334 regular pesos per month ($16.70 per month) and average monthly pension was $9.&lt;ref name=&quot;carmelo&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allbusiness.com/public-administration/national-security-international/3974438-1.html|title=The end of rationing?|author=Mesa-Lago, Carmelo|date=September 22, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A person can get more jail time for killing a cow (10 years in prison) than killing a human. Those who sell beef without government permission can get three to eight years in prison. Eaters of illegal beef can get three months to one year in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalexchange.org/countries/americas/cuba/2169.html|title=Drought and slaughter hurt Cuba's once-rich beef, milk industries}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the 1959 Cuban Revolution, citizens were not required to pay a personal [[income tax]] (their salaries being regarded as net of any taxes). However, from 1996, the State started to impose income taxes on Cubans earning hard currency, primarily the self-employed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D00EEDA1039F935A15752C1A963958260 |author=New York Times |month=November |year=1995 |title= Well-to-Do in Cuba to Pay an Income Tax |accessdate=2007-01-29 | work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Corruption Perceptions Index]] ranks Cuba 65th (from best to worst) out of 180 countries, better than most other countries in Central or Latin America.

==Agriculture==
{{Main|Agriculture in Cuba}}
As a result of inefficient state-run agriculture, Cuba imports up to 80% of the food it rations to the public.&lt;ref name=&quot;cnnfood&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/americas/04/16/cuba.farming/index.html|title=Cuban leader looks to boost food production|publisher=CNN | date=April 17, 2008 | accessdate=May 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; After coming to power, Raúl Castro, Fidel Castro's brother, has ridiculed the bureaucracy that shackles the agriculture sector.&lt;ref name=&quot;cnnfood&quot;/&gt;

==Industry==
[[Image:Oljepumpe cuba.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Oil pumps in Cuba]]
In total, industrial production accounted for almost 37% of the Cuban GDP, or US$6.9 billion, and employs 24% of the population, or 2,671,440 people, in 1996. {{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

More recently Cuba's world-class biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry is gaining in its importance to the economy. It has been claimed that soon it will become Cuba's main source of foreign exchange. Among the products sold internationally are vaccines against various viral and bacterial pathogens, and promising anti-cancer vaccines are undergoing exhaustive clinical trials. Some Cuban scientists, like V. Verez-Bencomo, have been awarded international prizes for their contributions in biotechnology and Sugar Cane. Cuban vaccines are sold, among other countries, in Russia, China, India, Pakistan, and several Latin American countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diplomatist.com/dipo1st07/story_03.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tertiary industries==
===Tourism===
[[Image:Varaderobeach.jpg|thumb|right|200px|White sand beach in [[Varadero, Cuba|Varadero]] ]]
{{Main|Tourism in Cuba}}
In the mid 1990s tourism surpassed [[sugar]], long the mainstay of the Cuban economy, as the primary source of foreign exchange. Tourism figures prominently in the Cuban Government's plans for development, and a top official cast it as the &quot;heart of the economy&quot;. Havana devotes significant resources to building new tourist facilities and renovating historic structures for use in the tourism sector. Cuban officials estimate roughly 1.6 million tourists visited Cuba in 1999 with about $1.9 [[1000000000 (number)|billion]] in gross revenues. In 2000, 1,773,986 foreign visitors arrived in Cuba. Revenue from tourism reached US $1.7 billion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/Americas/Cuba-TOURISM-TRAVEL-AND-RECREATION.html Cuba - Tourism, travel, and recreation&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The rapid growth of tourism has had widespread social and economic repercussions in Cuba. This has led to speculation of the emergence of a two-tier economy&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uiowa.edu/ifdebook/conferences/cuba/TLCP/Volume%201/Facio.pdf Tourism in Cuba during the Special Period]&lt;/ref&gt; and the fostering of a state of [[tourist segregation|tourist apartheid]] on the island. This situation was exacerbated by the influx of dollars into the Cuban economy during the 1990s, potentially creating a dual economy based on the dollar (the currency of tourists) on the one hand, and the peso on the other. Scarce imported goods - and even some of local manufacture, such as [[rum]] and [[coffee]]- could be had at dollars-only stores, but were hard to find or unavailable at peso prices. As a result, Cubans who earned only in the peso economy, outside the tourist sector, were at an economic disadvantage. Those with dollar incomes based upon the service industry began to live more comfortably. This widened the gulf between Cubans' material standards of living, in conflict with the Cuban Government's long term [[socialist]] policies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://traveloutward.com/articles/caribbean/6-03_cuba.shtml Lessons From Cuba] Travel Outward&lt;/ref&gt;

===Retail===

Cuba has a very poorly developed retail sector. There are no large shopping centers and the commercial districts that existed before the revolution are largely shut down. Those that remain carry few and poorly made products that are priced in dollars and are too expensive for the average Cuban to purchase. The majority of the stores are small dollar stores, bodegas, agro-mercados (farmers' markets) and street stands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/economies/Americas/Cuba.html Cuba - Monetary unit:, Chief exports:, Chief imports:, Gross domestic product:, Balance of trade:&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Poverty==
Typical wages range from factory worker's 400 non-convertible Cuban pesos a month to doctor's 700. That is only around 17-30 U.S. dollars a month. However, the Human Development Index of Cuba still ranks much higher than the vast majority of Latin American nations.&lt;ref name=&quot;comandate&quot;&gt;{{cite web|date=February 21, 2008|publisher=The Economist|title=Cuba - The comandante's last move|url=http://www.economist.com/displayStory.cfm?story_id=10727899}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Cuba lost subsidies in 1991, malnutrition resulted in an outbreak of diseases and general hunger.&lt;ref name=&quot;cordova&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=The situation of Cuban workers during the “Special Period in peacetime”|author=Efrén Córdova|url=http://lanic.utexas.edu/la/cb/cuba/asce/cuba6/45Cordova.fm.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, the poverty level reported by the government is one of the lowest in the developing world, ranking 6th out of 108 countries, 4th in Latin America, and 48th among all countries.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_Human_Development_Index#Complete_list_of_countries&lt;/ref&gt; Pensions are among the smallest in the Western hemisphere at $9.50. In 2009, Raul Castro increased minimum pensions by 2 dollars, which he said was to recompense for those who have &quot;dedicated a great part of their lives to working... and who remain firm in defense of socialism&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7370304.stm|title=Raul Castro raises state pension|publisher=BBC | date=April 27, 2008 | accessdate=January 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International trade==
The [[Netherlands]] receives the largest share of Cuban exports (24%), 70 to 80% of which go through Fondel Finance, a company owned by the [[Van 't Wout]] family who have close personal ties with Fidel Castro. Currently, this trend can be seen in other colonial Caribbean communities who have direct political ties with the global economy. (for example, British West Indies, United States Virgin Islands, French outer-territories, and so on). The second largest trade partner is Canada, with a 22% share of the Cuban export market.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/cuba/canada-cuba-trade.html FAQs on Canada-Cuba trade] CBC&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foreign investment==
Since the Special Period, Cuba has actively courted foreign investment. All would be foreign investors are required to form joint ventures with the Cuban government. The sole exception to this rule are Venezuelans, who are allowed to hold 100% ownership in businesses due to an economic agreement between Cuba and Venezuela. Cuban officials said in early 1998 that there were a total of 332 [[joint venture]]s. Many of these are loans or contracts for management, supplies, or services normally not considered equity investment in Western economies. Investors are constrained by the U.S.-Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act which provides sanctions for those who &quot;traffic&quot; in property expropriated from U.S. citizens. As of March 1998, 15 executives of three foreign companies have been excluded from entry into the United States. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Over a dozen companies have pulled out of Cuba or altered their plans to invest there due to the threat of action under the Libertad Act.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}
[[Image:Cuba006.jpg|thumb|right|270px|[[Tobacco]] plantation, [[Pinar del Río]].]]

===US Dollar===
In 1993 the Cuban Government made it legal for its people to possess and use the U.S. dollar. From then until 2004, the dollar became a major currency. To capture the hard currency flowing into the island through tourism and [[remittances]] - estimated at $500–800 million annually - the government set up state-run &quot;dollar stores&quot; throughout Cuba that sold 'luxury' food, household, and clothing items, compared with basic necessities, which were bought using the [[Cuban peso]]. As such, a gap in the standard of living developed between those with access to dollars and those without. Jobs that could earn dollar salaries or tips from foreign businesses and tourists became highly desirable. It was common to meet [[physician|doctors]], [[engineer]]s, [[scientist]]s, and other [[professional]]s working in [[restaurant]]s or as [[taxicab driver]]s.

However, in response to stricter [[U.S. embargo against Cuba|economic sanctions by the US]], and because the authorities were pleased with Cuba's economic recovery, the Cuban government decided in October 2004 to remove the American dollar from circulation. In its place, the [[Cuban convertible peso]] is now used, which although not internationally traded, has a value pegged to that of the dollar. As a source of additional revenue, a 10% surcharge is levied for conversions from US dollars to the convertible peso; this surcharge does not apply to other currencies, so it acts as an encouragement for tourists to bring currencies like [[Euro]]s, [[pound sterling|pounds sterling]] or [[Canadian dollar]]s into Cuba. Indeed, an increasing number of tourist zones now also accept Euros directly for many transactions.

==Self-employment==
To provide jobs for workers laid off due to the economic crisis that the government was having difficulty providing, and to try to bring some forms of black market activity into legal, and regulated, channels, Havana in 1993 legalized self-employment for some 150 occupations. The government tightly controls the small private sector, which has fluctuated in size from 150,000 to 209,000, by regulating and taxing it. For example, owners of small private restaurants (''[[paladar]]es'') can seat no more than 12 people&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Set monthly fees must be paid regardless of income earned and frequent inspections yield stiff fines when any of the many self-employment regulations are violated. Rather than expanding private sector opportunities, in recent years, the government has been attempting to squeeze more of these private sector entrepreneurs out of business and back to the public sector. Many have opted to enter the informal economy or black market. In recent years there has developed what is called &quot;[[urban agriculture]]&quot;, production which takes place on small parcels of land in the cities. Growing [[organopónicos]] (organic gardens) in the private sector has been attractive to city dwelling small producers who get to sell their products in the same place where they produce them, avoiding taxes and enjoying a measure of government help from the Ministry of Agriculture (MINAGRI) in the form of seed houses and advisers.

==Connection with Venezuela==
The relationship cultivated between [[Cuba]] and [[Venezuela]] in recent years has resulted in agreements in which Venezuela provides cheap oil in exchange for Cuban &quot;missions&quot; of doctors to bolster the Venezuelan health care system. Cuba, with the second-highest per capita number of physicians in the world (behind [[Italy]]), sends tens of thousands of doctors to other countries as aid, as well as to obtain favorable economic terms of trade.

'''Transportation in [[Cuba]]''' is composed of a system of railways, roads, airports, waterways, ports and harbours:

==Railways==
{{Main|Ferrocarriles de Cuba}}
[[Image:Ferrocarriles de cuba map.gif|250px|right|thumb|Railway network in Cuba]]
* ''total:'' 11,968&amp;nbsp;km (4,226&amp;nbsp;km + 7,742&amp;nbsp;km)
* ''[[standard gauge]]:'' 4,226&amp;nbsp;km {{RailGauge|sg}} gauge (140&amp;nbsp;km electrified)
* ''note:'' an additional 7,742&amp;nbsp;km of track is used by sugar plantations; about 65% of this track is standard gauge; the rest is [[Narrow gauge railway|narrow gauge]] (2003)

Cuba built the first railway system in the Spanish empire, before [[History of rail transport in Spain|the 1848 start in the Iberian peninsula]]. While the rail infrastructure dates from colonial and early republican times, passenger service along the principal Havana to Santiago corridor is increasingly reliable and popular with tourists who can purchase tickets in [[Cuban convertible peso]]s. As with most public transport in Cuba, the vehicles used are second hand, and the flagship ''Tren Francés'' (&quot;French train&quot;) between [[Havana]] and [[Santiago de Cuba]] is operated by coaches originally used in Europe between [[Paris]] and [[Amsterdam]] on the ex-[[Trans Europ Express|TEE]] express. The train is formed by 12 coaches and a [[People's Republic of China|Chinese]]-built [[locomotive]].

With the order of 12 new Chinese locomotives, built specially for Cuban Railways at [[China Northern Locomotives and Rolling Stock Works]], services have been improving in reliability. Those benefiting the most are long distance freight services with the French train Havana-Santiago being the only passenger train using one of the new Chinese locomotives regularly.  Various orders are in place for 100 locomotives from China and various freight wagons and passenger coaches.

==Roads==
[[Image:Via Blanca-Matanzas.JPG|250px|thumb|right|Via Blanca highway near [[Matanzas, Cuba|Matanzas]]]]
The total length of Cuba's highways is 60,858&amp;nbsp;km, including
*''paved:'' 29,820&amp;nbsp;km (including 638&amp;nbsp;km of expressway)
*''unpaved:'' 31,038&amp;nbsp;km (1999 est.)

Expressways ([[autopista]]s) include
*the Autopista Nacional (A1) from Havana to [[Santa Clara, Cuba|Santa Clara]] and [[Sancti Spiritus, Cuba|Sancti Spiritus]], with additional short sections near [[Santiago de Cuba|Santiago]] and [[Guantanamo]]
*the Autopista Este-Oeste (A4) from Havana to [[Pinar del Rio]]
*the Autopista del Mediodia from Havana to [[San Antonio de los Baños]]
*an autopista from Havana to [[Melena del Sur]]
*an autopista from Havana to [[Mariel]]
*the Havana ring road ({{lang-es|1er anillo de La Habana}}), which starts at a [[:es:Túnel de La Habana|tunnel]] under the entrance to [[Havana Harbor]]
*the section of the [[Via Blanca (Cuba)|Via Blanca]] from [[Matanzas]] to [[Varadero]] (toll road)

Older roads include the [[Carretera Central (Cuba)|Carretera Central]], and the Via Blanca from Havana to Matanzas.

==Long-distance and inter-municipality buses in Cuba==
There are two national bus companies in Cuba. Viazul operate a fleet of modern and comfortable coaches on longer distance routes designed principally for tourists. Slower and less reliable services are provided by Astro Bus, generally with much older vehicles, many imported from the [[Soviet Union]]. These services are significantly cheaper than Viazul, and are therefore increasingly popular with budget conscious tourists and visitors to Cuba. However, ASTRO (Asociacion de Transporte por Omnibus) has recently{{when|date=May 2011}} purchased from the Chinese manufacturer Yutong Bus a fleet of nearly 1000 air-conditioned units. They are being used on most of the long distance routes nationwide and some services have been increased. However, the ticket price was also raised recently{{when|date=May 2011}}, making it less affordable for the regular Cuban that chooses ASTRO to travel. Routes that have benefited most so far are those from Havana to each of the 13 provincial capitals of the country.

On 27 June 2007 it was reported that Cuba will start assembling the 200 first Yutong buses for inter-municipal transportation starting the second half of 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cubaheadlines.com/2007/06/27/4110/cuba_to_assemble_chinese_buses.html Cuba to assemble chinese buses | Cuba News Headlines.

==Urban buses==

[[Image:Ferro bus.jpg|thumb|Ferro Bus in Levisa near [[Mayarí]] in [[Holguín Province]]]]
[[Image:Autobus de TUSSAM en La Habana.jpg|thumb|A decommissioned bus from [[Seville]], now operating in Havana]]
In Havana urban transportation is provided by a colourful selection of buses imported from the [[Soviet Union]] or [[Canada]]. Many of these vehicles are second hand (such as the 1500 decommissioned Dutch buses, which the [[Netherlands]] donated to Cuba in the mid 1990s) and despite the United States trade embargo, American-style [[yellow school bus]]es (imported second-hand from Canada) are increasingly common sights. On seven key lines in and out of the city, service is provided by ''camellos'' (&quot;camels&quot; or &quot;dromedaries&quot;, after their &quot;humps&quot;), [[trailer bus]]es that haul as many as two hundred passengers in a passenger carrying trailer. The camellos will be phased out in April 2008 with [[China|Chinese]] [[Zhengzhou Yutong Bus]]es.

After the upgrading of [[Seville]]'s public bus fleet to [[Compressed natural gas|CNG-powered]] and new vehicles, many of the [[IVECO|decommissioned ones]] were donated to the city of Havana. These bright orange buses still display the name of ''Transportes Urbanos de Sevilla, S.A.M.'', their former owner, and Seville's coat of arms as a sign of gratitude.&lt;ref&gt;The last lot was delivered in 2006: [http://www.sevilla.org/impe/sevilla/contenido?pag=/contenidos/centro_prensa/noticias_2006/Julio/28_07_2006_m&amp;vE=D4268,9,15 &quot;Entrega de 16 autobuses de TUSSAM a la Habana como gesto solidario&quot;], nota de prensa del Ayuntamiento de Sevilla&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br clear=left&gt;

On 18 July 2007 it was reported that Cuba will receive 100 urban buses from Belarus before years end, destined for use in Havana.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cubaheadlines.com/2007/07/18/4520/belarus_to_ship_100_urban_buses_to_cuba_by_late_2007.html Belarus to ship 100 urban buses to Cuba by late 2007 | Cuba News Headlines. Cuban Daily News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Cuban State Council Vice President Carlos Lage declared in 2007 that Cuba would receive 1,142 more Chinese buses for urban transport before years end&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/bizchina/2007-10/03/content_6151768.htm Cuba praises high quality of Chinese-made buses&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Automobiles ==
Cuba is famous for its old cars and trucks, which can be seen in daily use throughout the country. For the first part of the 20th century, most new vehicles came to Cuba from the United States. The flow stopped in late 1959 when economic reforms by the then-new government of Fidel Castro prevented Cubans from buying cars on credit.&lt;ref&gt;Don't blame Dwight. (http://caristas.blogspot.com/2008/12/its-widely-held-that-flow-of-american.html&lt;/ref&gt; A subsequent U.S. trade embargo, instituted in October 1960 in response to Cuba's seizure of U.S.-owned properties,&lt;ref&gt;Gebler, Carlo. Driving Through Cuba (an East-West Journey). London. Hamish Hamilton Ltd., 1988. ISBN 0-241-12286-4 p.12&lt;/ref&gt; not only ensured that new vehicle exports would remain halted, but also denied Cuban motorists a direct source of replacement parts. As a result, Cubans became expert at adapting or fabricating parts to keep on the road cars that in other countries would long since have been recycled.&lt;ref&gt;Schweid, Richard. Che's Chevrolet, Fidel's Oldsmobile (On the Road in Cuba). Chapel Hill, London. University of North Carolina Press, 2004. ISBN 0-8078-2892-0 p.196&lt;/ref&gt;

As well, the Castro government found an alternate source for vehicles in its new patron, the Soviet Union, which supplied the island with Volgas, Moskvich 1500s, Ladas and other Eastern Bloc cars, mainly for state use. The Soviet Union also sent heavy trucks such as the ubiquitous ZIL and the rugged KrAZ.&lt;ref&gt;http://caristas.blogspot.com/2010/12/kraz-king-kong-of-trucks.html&lt;/ref&gt; Cars also trickled in from Europe and, in later years, Asia. Since 2009, Cuba has imported sedans from Chinese automaker Geely to serve as police cars, taxis and rental vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;http://caristas.blogspot.com/2011/01/geely-prounced-jee-lee-or-in-cuba-heely.html&lt;/ref&gt;

While many older Soviet and European cars remain in service in Cuba, they are largely eclipsed by the island's great 1950s Cadillacs, Packards,  De Sotos and similar products from one of the most ornate styling periods in U.S. auto history. Their pastel colours, tall fins and extensive chrome make them a favouriste subject for tourist photographs.

As many as 60,000 American vehicles are in use on the island,&lt;ref&gt; Schweid, Richard. Che's Chevrolet, Fidel's Oldsmobile (On the Road in Cuba). Chapel Hill, London. University of North Carolina Press, 2004. ISBN 0-8078-2892-0 &lt;/ref&gt; nearly all in private hands. Pre-1960 vehicles remain the property of their original owners and descendents, and can be sold to other Cubans providing the proper ''traspaso'' certificate is in place. Such transactions can be difficult,&lt;ref&gt;http://caristas.blogspot.com/2009/04/and-sometimes-their-money-is-no-good.html&lt;/ref&gt; but in 2010, reforms approved by a Communist Party congress were expected to legalize the sale between Cuban citizens of all cars, as well as real estate.&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press, May 9, 2011, &quot;Cuba publishes awaited details of economic changes,&quot; http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5h58oM9YBK_FAA4jVfqAnYftEVKcA?docId=981469f3f267429fb37d216f40bb94c6&lt;/ref&gt;

Of Cuba's vintage American cars, any have been modified with newer engines, disc brakes and other parts, often scavenged from Soviet cars, and most bear the marks of decades of use.&lt;ref&gt;Schweid, Richard. Che's Chevrolet, Fidel's Oldsmobile (On the Road in Cuba). Chapel Hill, London. University of North Carolina Press, 2004. ISBN 0-8078-2892-0  p.196&lt;/ref&gt; A Others, however, have been lovingly preserved in their original condition, and would be coveted by collectors in other countries.&lt;ref&gt;http://caristas.blogspot.com/2011/01/sweetest-55-in-cuba.html&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from a brief period in the 1990s, however, the Castro government has forbidden the sale of Cuban vehicles to foreigners.

=== Hitchhiking and carpooling ===
Since the start of the &quot;[[Special Period]]&quot; in 1991 ([[energy shortages]] caused by the loss of the [[Soviet Union]] as a trading partner), hitchhiking and carpooling have become important parts of Cuba's transportation system and society in general.  In 1999, an article in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine claimed &quot;In Cuba[...] hitchhiking is custom. Hitchhiking is essential. Hitchhiking is what makes Cuba move.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,36287,00.html#ixzz1Ch67vm4p&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cuba]]'s once-ambitious foreign policy has been down sized as a result of [[economy|economic hardship]] after the collapse of the [[Soviet bloc]]. Without massive Soviet subsidies and its primary [[trade|trading]] partner Cuba was comparatively isolated in the 1990s, but has since entered bilateral co-operation with several South American countries, most notably [[Venezuela]] and [[Bolivia]].

In all, Cuba continues to have formal relations with 160 nations, and provided civilian assistance workers - principally medical - in more than 20 nations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.state.gov/outofdate/bgn/c/13238.htm Cuba (09/01)] US Department of State report&lt;/ref&gt; More than [[Cuban exiles|two million exiles]] have escaped to foreign countries.

Cuba is currently a lead country on the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]], and is a founding member of the anti-American organization known as the [[Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas]], a member of the [[Latin American Integration Association]] and the [[United Nations]]. Cuba is a member of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] and hosted its September 2006 summit.

==History==
===Spanish colonial period===
Prior to achieving its independence, Cuba was a colony of Spain.

===1898-1959===
Prior to the triumph of the [[Cuban Revolution]], Cuba maintained strong economic and political ties to the United States. From 1902 until its abrogation in 1934, the [[Platt Amendment]] authorized the US to use military force to preserve Cuba's independence.

In 1917, Cuba entered World War I on the side of the allies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emayzine.com/lectures/HISTOR~7.htm History of Cuba&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Cuba joined the [[League of Nations]] in 1920.

In 1941, Cuba declared war on Italy, Germany, and Japan.

Cuba joined the United Nations in 1945.

Cuba joined the [[Organization of American States]] (OAS) in 1948.

During the Presidency of [[Fulgencio Batista]], Cuba did not initially face trade restrictions. In mid-1958, the United States imposed an arms embargo on the Batista administration.

===The Cold War===

[[Image:Castro Khrushchev.jpg|thumb|right|275px|Fidel Castro embracing former [[Soviet Union]] Premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]].]]

Following the establishment of diplomatic ties to the Soviet Union, and after the Cuban Missile Crisis, Cuba became increasingly dependent on Soviet markets and military and economic aid. Castro was able to build a formidable military force with the help of Soviet equipment and military advisors. The KGB kept in close touch with Havana, and Castro tightened Communist Party control over all levels of government, the media, and the educational system, while developing a Soviet-style internal police force.

Castro's alliance with the Soviet Union caused something of a split between him and Guevara. In 1966, Guevara left for [[Bolivia]] in an ill-fated attempt to stir up revolution against the country's government.

On August 23, 1968, Castro made a public gesture to the USSR that caused the Soviet leadership to reaffirm their support for him. Two days after [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia|the Soviet invasion of]] [[Czechoslovakia]] to repress the [[Prague Spring]], Castro took to the airwaves and publicly denounced the Czech rebellion. Castro warned the Cuban people about the Czechoslovakian 'counterrevolutionaries', who &quot;were moving Czechoslovakia towards capitalism and into the arms of [[imperialism|imperialists]]&quot;. He called the leaders of the rebellion &quot;the agents of [[West Germany]] and [[fascist]] reactionary rabble.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Castro | first = Fidel | authorlink = | coauthors = |date= | year = 1968 | month = August | url = http://lanic.utexas.edu/la/cb/cuba/castro/1968/19680824 | title = Castro comments on Czechoslovakia crisis | work = | pages = | publisher = FBIS| accessdate =}}&lt;/ref&gt; In return for his public backing of the invasion, at a time when some Soviet allies were deeming the invasion an infringement of Czechoslovakia's sovereignty, the Soviets bailed out the Cuban economy with extra loans and an immediate increase in oil exports.

The relationship between the Soviet Union's KGB and the Cuban [[Intelligence Directorate]] was complex and marked by times of extremely close cooperation and times of extreme competition. The Soviet Union saw the new revolutionary government in Cuba as an excellent proxy agent in areas of the world where Soviet involvement was not popular on a local level. [[Nikolai Leninov]], the KGB Chief in [[Mexico City]], was one of the first Soviet officials to recognize [[Fidel Castro]]'s potential as a revolutionary and urged the Soviet Union to strengthen ties with the new Cuban leader. Moscow saw Cuba as having far more appeal with new revolutionary movements, western intellectuals, and members of the [[New Left]] with Cuba's perceived [[Goliath (Bible)|David and Goliath]] struggle against [[US imperialism]]. Shortly after the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] in 1963, Moscow invited 1,500 DI agents, including [[Che Guevara]], to the KGB's [[Moscow Center]] for intensive training in intelligence operations.

After the [[Cuban revolution|revolution]] of 1959, Cuba soon took actions inimical to American trade interests on the island. In response, the U.S. stopped buying Cuban sugar and refused to supply its former trading partner with much needed oil. Relations between the countries deteriorated rapidly. In April 1961, following air attacks preparing for the [[Bay of Pigs invasion]] by CIA-trained [[Cuban exile]]s, prime minister Fidel Castro declared Cuba to be a [[socialist republic]], and moved quickly to develop the growing relations between Cuba and the Soviet Union.

In 1962, Cuba was expelled from the [[Organization of American States]] - Thereafter, many nations throughout Latin America broke ties with Cuba.

Following the establishment of diplomatic ties, and after the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] in 1962, Cuba became increasingly dependent on Soviet markets and military and economic aid. Cuba was able to build a large military force with the help of Soviet equipment and military advisors. The Soviets also kept in close touch with Havana, sharing varying close relations until the collapse of the bloc in 1990.

===Russia===
See [[Cuba–Russia relations]]

Relations between the two countries suffered somewhat during the [[Boris Yeltsin]] administration, as Cuba was forced to look for new major allies, such as China, after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Relations improved when [[Vladimir Putin]] was elected as the new Russian President. Putin, and later [[Dmitry Medvedev]], emphasized re-establishing strong relations with old Soviet allies. In 2008, Medvedev visited Havana and [[Raúl Castro]] made a week long trip to Moscow. In that same year the two governments signed multiple economic agreements and Russia sent tons of humanitarian aid to Cuba. Cuba, meanwhile, gave staunch political support for Russia during the [[2008 South Ossetia war]]. Relations between the two nations are currently at a post-Soviet high, and talks about potentially re-establishing a Russian military presence in Cuba are even beginning to surface.

====Relations in Latin America and Africa during the Cold War====
{{quote|&quot;Cuba has a unique symbolic allure. It is the small country that confronted the U.S. empire and has survived despite the attempts by all U.S. presidents since to subdue its communist government. It is the island with iconic leaders like Fidel Castro and [[Che Guevara]], and the Latin American country that in the language of revolutionaries everywhere embodies the struggle of socialist humanism against the materialism of capitalist societies. Cuba is also the small nation that in the past sent its troops to die in faraway lands in Latin America and even Africa fighting for the poor.&quot;| [[Moisés Naím]], ''[[Newsweek]]'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsweek.com/id/201752 The Havana Obsession: Why All Eyes are on a Bankrupt Island] by Moisés Naím, ''Newsweek'', June 22, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;}}

During the cold war, Cuba's influence in the Americas was inhibited by the [[Monroe Doctrine]] and the dominance of the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;foreignaffairs&quot;&gt;[http://www.foreignaffairs.org/19870601faessay7856/pamela-s-falk/cuba-in-africa.html Cuba in Africa] Foreign Affairs magazine 1987&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this Fidel Castro became an influential figurehead for leftist groups in the region, extending support to Marxist Revolutionary movements throughout Latin America, most notably aiding the [[Sandinista]]s in overthrowing [[Somoza]] in [[Nicaragua]] in 1979. In 1971, Fidel Castro took a month-long visit to [[Chile]]. The visit, in which Castro participated actively in the internal politics of the country, holding massive rallies and giving public advice to [[Salvador Allende]], was seen by those on the political right as proof to support their view that &quot;The Chilean Way to Socialism&quot; was an effort to put Chile on the same path as Cuba.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Quirk|first=Robert|authorlink=|coauthors=|date=|year=1995|month=August|url=|title=Fidel Castro|work=|pages=|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cuba's intervention in Africa, which began in the mid-1970s, was more substantial leading to involvement in 17 African nations and three African insurgencies soon leading Cuban soldiers engaging in frontline military combat.&lt;ref name=&quot;foreignaffairs&quot;/&gt; In doing so Castro aligned Cuba with African insurgencies against colonial vestiges and specifically against South Africa.&lt;ref name=&quot;foreignaffairs&quot;/&gt; By providing military aid Cuba won trading partners for the Soviet bloc and potential converts to [[Marxism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;foreignaffairs&quot;/&gt;

On November 4, 1975, Castro ordered the deployment of Cuban troops to [[Angola]] to aid the Marxist [[Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola|MPLA]] government against [[UNITA]] forces, which were being supported by the [[People's Republic of China]], and later the United States, [[Israel]], and South Africa (see: [[Cuba in Angola]]). After two months on their own, Moscow aided the Cuban mission with the USSR engaging in a massive airlift of Cuban forces into Angola. On this, [[Nelson Mandela]] is said to have remarked &quot;Cuban internationalists have done so much for African independence, freedom, and justice.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mandela|first=Nelson|date=|url=http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Nelson_Mandela|title=Attributed quotes of Nelson Mandela|publisher=Wikiquote.org|accessdate=2006-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cuban troops were also sent to Marxist [[Ethiopia]] to assist Ethiopian forces in the [[Ogaden War]] with Somalia in 1977. Cuba sent troops along with the Soviet Union to aid the [[Mozambican Liberation Front|FRELIMO]] and MPLA governments in [[Mozambique]] and Angola, respectively, while they were fighting U.S. and South African-backed insurgent groups [[Mozambican National Resistance|RENAMO]] (supported by [[Rhodesia]] as well) and [[National Union for Total Independence of Angola|UNITA]]. He also aided the government of [[Mengistu Haile Mariam]] in Ethiopia during its conflict with [[Somalia]]. Overall, an estimated 14,000 Cubans were killed in Cuban military actions abroad.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grady2005&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=O'Grady|first=Mary Anastasia|date=2005-10-30|url=http://www.cubacenter.org/media/news_articles/countingcastrosvictims.php|title=Counting Castro's Victims|publisher=Wallstreet Journal, Center for a Free Cuba|accessdate=2006-05-11 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060418094333/http://www.cubacenter.org/media/news_articles/countingcastrosvictims.php &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Castro never disclosed the amount of casualties in Soviet African wars, but one estimate is 14,000, a high number for the small country.&lt;ref&gt;''Return to Havana'' by Maurice Halperin&lt;/ref&gt;

Cuban troops were also sent to Marxist [[Ethiopia]] to assist Ethiopian forces in the Ogaden War with Somalia in 1977. In addition, Castro extended support to [[Marxist]] Revolutionary movements throughout Latin America, such as aiding the [[Sandinista]]s in overthrowing the [[Anastasio Somoza Debayle|Somoza]] government in [[Nicaragua]] in 1979. It has been claimed by the [[Carthage Foundation]]-funded Center for a Free Cuba&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=2006-08-25 | url = http://www.mediatransparency.org/recipientgrants.php?recipientID=1892 | title = Recipient Grants: Center for a Free Cuba | accessdate = 2006-08-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that an estimated 14,000 Cubans were killed in Cuban military actions abroad.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grady2005&quot; /&gt;

====Post–Cold War relations====
[[Image:Vladimir Putin in Cuba 14-17 December 2000-12.jpg|thumb|right|Fidel Castro with Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]], December 2000]]
In the post–Cold War environment Cuban support for guerrilla warfare in Latin America has largely subsided, though the Cuban government continued to provide political assistance and support for left leaning groups and parties in the developing Western Hemisphere.

When Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] visited Cuba in 1989, the comradely relationship between Havana and Moscow was strained by Gorbachev's implementation of economic and political reforms in the USSR. &quot;We are witnessing sad things in other socialist countries, very sad things&quot;, lamented Castro in November 1989, in reference to the changes that were sweeping such communist allies as the Soviet Union, [[East Germany]], Hungary, and Poland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=1989-11-09 | url = http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?r101:S17NO9-1592: | title = Castro Laments 'Very Sad Things' in Bloc |publisher = Washington Post |accessdate = 2006-05-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The subsequent [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991 had an immediate and devastating effect on Cuba.

Cuba today works with a growing bloc of Latin American politicians opposed to the &quot;[[Washington consensus]]&quot;, the American-led doctrine that [[free trade]], open markets, and [[privatization]] will lift poor third world countries out of economic stagnation. The Cuban government have condemned [[neoliberalism]] as a destructive force in the developing world, creating an alliance with Presidents [[Hugo Chávez]] of [[Venezuela]] and [[Evo Morales]] of [[Bolivia]] in opposing such policies.&lt;ref&gt;Reel, Monte.

Currently, Cuba has diplomatically friendly relationships with Presidents [[Hugo Chávez]] of Venezuela, [[Lula da Silva]] of [[Brazil]], and [[Cristina Fernández]] of [[Argentina]], with Chávez as perhaps his staunchest ally in the post-Soviet era. Cuba has sent thousands of teachers and medical personnel to Venezuela to assist Chávez's [[socialism|socialist]] oriented economic programs. Chávez, in turn provides Cuba with lower priced petroleum. Cuba's debt for oil to Venezuela is believed to be on the order of one billion US dollars.&lt;ref&gt;http://havanajournal.com/business_comments/A1221_0_4_0_M/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relations with Caribbean Community (CARICOM)==
Ties between the nations of the [[Caribbean Community]] (CARICOM) and Cuba have remained cordial over the course of the later half of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationnews.com/story/284896411769321.php Arthur points out ties that bind] ''The Nation'' newspaper&lt;/ref&gt; Formal diplomatic relations between the CARICOM economic giants: [[Barbados]], [[Jamaica]], [[Guyana]] and [[Trinidad and Tobago]] have existed since 1972,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barbadosadvocate.com/NewViewNewsleft.cfm?Record=23679 Advocate&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/news/html/20051207t210000-0500_94154_obs_all_set_for_cuba_caricom_summit.asp All set for Cuba/Caricom Summit - JAMAICAOBSERVER.COM&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and have over time led to an increase in cooperation between the [[CARICOM Heads of Government]] and Cuba. At a summit meeting of sixteen Caribbean countries in 1998, Fidel Castro called for regional unity, saying that only strengthened cooperation between Caribbean countries would prevent their domination by rich nations in a global economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | month = August 21 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/156312.stm | title = Castro calls for Caribbean unity | format =| work = | pages = | publisher = BBC New | language = | accessdate = 2006-05-21 | date=1998-08-21 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cuba, for many years regionally isolated, increased grants and scholarships to the Caribbean countries.

To celebrate ties between the Caribbean Community and Cuba in 2002 the Heads of Government of Cuba and CARICOM have designated the day of December 8 to be called 'CARICOM-Cuba Day'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caribbeannetnews.com/2004/12/07/sanders.htm Caribbean Net News: CARICOM-Cuba Day: 8 December - A time for Celebration&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The day is the exact date of the formal opening of diplomatic relations between the first CARICOM-four and Cuba.

In December 2005, during the second CARICOM/CUBA summit held in Barbados, heads of CARICOM and Cuba agreed to deepen their ties in the areas of socio-economic and political cooperation in addition to medical care assistance. Since the meeting, Cuba has opened four additional embassies in the Caribbean Community including: [[Antigua and Barbuda]], [[Dominica]], [[Suriname]], and [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]]. This development makes Cuba the only nation to have embassies in all independent countries of the Caribbean Community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caribbeannetnews.com/cgi-script/csArticles/articles/000008/000823.htm Caribbean Net News: Cuba opens more Caribbean embassies&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; CARICOM and Canadian politicians&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caricom.org/jsp/pressreleases/pres21_98.htm New focus on CARICOM/Canada relations&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; have jointly maintained that through the International inclusion of Cuba, a more positive change might indeed be brought about there (politically) as has been witnessed in the [[People's Republic of China]].

Cuban cooperation with the Caribbean was extended by a joint health programme between Cuba and Venezuela named [[Healthcare of Cuba#Operaci.C3.B3n Milagro|Operación Milagro]], set up in 2005. The initiative is part of the Sandino commitment, which sees both countries coming together with the aim of offering free ophthalmology operations to an estimated 4.5 million people in Latin America and the Caribbean over a ten-year period.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.scotsman.com/health.cfm?id=2305142005 Havana's Operation Miracle helps eye patients see light] News.

In 1998 Trinidad Prime Minister [[Patrick Manning]] had a heart valve replacement surgery in Cuba and returned in 2004 to have a pacemaker implanted.&lt;ref name=&quot;Caribbean&quot;&gt;[http://www.seattlepi.com/national/1102AP_Cuba_Friendly_Neighbors.html Cuba enjoys ties with Caribbean neighbor ASSOCIATED PRESS]&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Fidel Castro's illness and temporary [[2006 Cuban transfer of presidential duties|transfer of power]] Caribbean leaders sent get-well-soon messages to Castro. Leaders included Prime Minister [[Kenny Anthony]] of [[St. Lucia]] who announced: &quot;We pray for President Castro and we wish him God's blessings&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Caribbean&quot;/&gt; [[Grenada]]n Prime Minister [[Keith Mitchell]] stated &quot;Cuba has been a long-standing friend to the entire Caribbean&quot;, and Trinidad Prime Minister Patrick Manning issued a statement extending Castro his &quot;best wishes for a prompt recovery.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Caribbean&quot;/&gt; Additionally the Cuban-Barbadian Friendship Association (CBFA) and the social movement known as the [[Clement Payne Movement]] also extended a press release stating &quot;We will lead the process for all progressive organisations in Barbados to hold a solidarity meeting with the government and people of the Republic of Cuba on August 13 at the Clement Payne Cultural Centre&quot;. Both organizations stated they would be planning to send a delegation to Cuba to celebrate with Fidel Castro his 80th birthday, in addition to the annual observance on October 6 of [[Cubana Flight 455]] which was bombed off the coast of Barbados in 1976 via a [[CIA]]-linked plot.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationnews.com/story/341433360958481.php The Nation Newspaper | Get-well wishes for Castro&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2008 the CARICOM Heads of Government opened the third Cuba-CARICOM Summit in Cuba. The summit is to look at closer integration of the Caribbean Community and Cuba.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cananews.net/news/131/ARTICLE/32294/2008-12-08.html TIES THAT BIND: CUBA/CARICOM leaders talk closer cooperation] - Caribbean News Agency (CANA) - Monday, 08 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt; During the summit the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) bestowed Fidel Castro with the highest honour of CARICOM, [[Order of the Caribbean Community|The Honorary Order of the Caribbean Community]] which is presented in exceptional circumstances to those who have offered their services in an outstanding way and have made significant contributions to the region.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.granma.cu/ingles/2008/diciembre/mar9/50orden-i.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trinidadexpress.com/index.pl/article_news?id=161410291 Caricom's highest honour for Fidel] - Trinidad and Tobago Express Newspaper - December 7, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Cuba has supported a number of leftist groups and parties in Latin America and the Caribbean since the 1959 revolution. In the 1960s Cuba established close ties with the emerging [[Guatemala]]n social movement led by Luis Augusto Turcios Lima, and supported the establishment of the [[Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity|URNG]], a militant organization that has evolved into one of Guatemala's current political parties. In the 1980s Cuba backed the [[Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front|FMLN]] in [[El Salvador]], providing military and intelligence training, weapons, guidance, and organizational support.

===Brazil===
{{Main|Brazilian–Cuban relations}}

With the electoral win of the President of Brazil, [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]] in 2002 ties between Cuba and Brazil have steadily warmed. Brazil continues to play its part in trying to revive and upgrade the offshore oil and gas infrastructure of Cuba.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/3266509.stm | work=BBC News | title=Cuba's new oil industry | date=2003-11-13 | accessdate=2010-05-02 | first=Tom | last=Fawthrop}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, talks led by Brazil are underway seeking to develop a framework for Cuba to become a normalised affiliate member of the [[Mercosur]] bloc of countries.

===Canada===
{{Main|Canada-Cuba Relations}}

Canada has maintained consistently cordial relations with Cuba, in spite of considerable pressure from the United States, and the island is also one of the most popular travel destinations for Canadian citizens. Canada-Cuba relations can be traced back to the 18th century, when vessels from the [[Atlantic provinces]] of Canada traded codfish and beer for rum and sugar. Cuba was the first country in the Caribbean selected by Canada for a diplomatic mission. Official diplomatic relations were established in 1945, when [[Emile Vaillancourt]], a noted writer and historian, was designated Canada's representative in Cuba. Canada and Mexico were the only two countries in the hemisphere to maintain uninterrupted diplomatic relations with Cuba following the Cuban Revolution in 1959.

In 1994, a joint venture was formed between the [[Cuban Nickel Union]] and the Canadian firm [[Sherritt International]], which operates a mining and processing plant on the island in [[Moa, Cuba|Moa]]. A second enterprise, [[Cobalt Refinery Co. Inc.]], was created in Alberta for nickel refining. Canada has been critical of the U.S. trade embargo against Cuba, and strongly objected to the [[Helms-Burton Act]]. In 1996 Foreign Affairs Minister [[Lloyd Axworthy]] stated: &quot;Canada shares the U.S. objectives of improving human rights standards and moving to more representative government in Cuba. But we are concerned that the Helms-Burton Act takes the wrong approach. That is why we have been working with other countries to uphold the principles of international law&quot;. In 1996 a [[Private Member's Bill]] was introduced, but not made law, in the [[Canadian parliament]]; this law called the [[Godfrey-Milliken Bill]] was in response to the extraterritoriality of the aforementioned Act.

Former Prime Minister [[Pierre Trudeau]] and Fidel Castro were personal friends. Castro was among Pierre Trudeau's pallbearers at [[State funeral of Pierre Trudeau|his funeral]] in 2000. Former Prime Minister [[Jean Chrétien]] and Fidel Castro also maintained a close relationship.

===Chile===
{{Main|Chile–Cuba relations}}

Cuba has been since the 1960s a reference point to [[left wing]] politicians in Chile. Recently relations to Cuba has been hot subject in [[Concert of Parties for Democracy|Concertación]] politics since the [[Christian Democrat Party of Chile]], member of the Concertación, has supported a  harder line in the diplomatic relations with Cuba while the [[Socialist Party of Chile]] has opposed this.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

In 1971, despite an [[Organization of American States]] convention that no nation in the Western Hemisphere would have a relationship with Cuba (the only exception being Mexico, which had refused to adopt that convention), Castro took a month-long visit to Chile, following the re-establishment of diplomatic relations with Cuba. The visit, in which Castro participated actively in the internal politics of the country, holding massive rallies and giving public advice to [[Salvador Allende]], was seen by those on the political right as proof to support their view that &quot;The Chilean Way to Socialism&quot; was an effort to put Chile on the same path as Cuba.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Quirk | first = Robert | authorlink = | coauthors = |date= | year = 1995 | month = August | url = | title = Fidel Castro | work = | pages = | publisher = W.

===Colombia===
During the Cold War, Cuba gave training, money, medicines, weapons and safe haven to members of [[Colombian people|Colombian]] guerrilla movements, especially to the [[National Liberation Army (Colombia)|ELN]] and also to members of the [[Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia|FARC]], both of which were founded in the early 1960s. In recent years, Fidel Castro has made gestures of reconciliation with different Colombian government administrations, and has been considered responsible for facilitating talks between them and the opposing guerrilla groups.

===Costa Rica===
[[Costa Rica]] broke relations with Cuba in 1961 to protest Cuban support of the left in Central America and renewed formal diplomatic ties with Fidel Castro's government in March, 2009. In 1995, Costa Rica established a [[consular office]] in [[Havana]]. Cuba opened a consular office in Costa Rica in 2001, but relations continued to be difficult. In 2006, shortly after the death of [[Augusto Pinochet]], Costa Rican President [[Óscar Arias]] compared Fidel Castro's human rights record to that of the former Chilean president. In response, Cuban officials released a statement describing the Washington aligned Arias as a &quot;vulgar mercenary&quot; of U.S. officials, and asserting that Washington &quot;always had on hand another opportunistic clown ready to follow its aggressive plans against Cuba.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mlive.com/newsflash/international/index.ssf?/base/international-10/11672682008600.xml&amp;storylist=international] Cuba slams Costa Rican leader's remarks.

===El Salvador===
Cuba and [[El Salvador]] resumed diplomatic relations on June 1, 2009. El Salvador previously suspended diplomatic relations with Cuba 50 years ago due to the Cuban Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jdUQFbECZYRXiqkl75Rzs3cPsH6w El Salvador and Cuba reestablish diplomatic ties]&lt;/ref&gt; Diplomatic ties were resumed after El Salvador's new president [[Mauricio Funes]], who had pledged to reestablish them, was sworn into office. El Salvador is also the very last Latin American nation to resume diplomatic relations with Cuba.

===Mexico===
Cuba had held good relations with Mexico since the Revolution. Also, when Cuba was expelled from the [[Organization of American States]], Mexico did not support this resolution and abstained. Relations were stable from 1934 to 1998.

Although the relationship between Cuba and Mexico remains strained, each side appears to make attempts to improve it. In 1998, Fidel Castro apologized for remarks he made about Mickey Mouse which led Mexico to recall its ambassador from Havana. He said he intended no offense when he said earlier that Mexican children would find it easier to name Disney characters than to recount key figures in Mexican history. Rather, he said, his words were meant to underscore the cultural dominance of the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=1998-12-19 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/238827.stm | title = Castro says sorry to Mexico | publisher = BBC News | accessdate = 2006-05-21 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mexican president [[Vicente Fox]] apologized to Fidel Castro in 2002 over statements by Castro, who had taped their telephone conversation, to the effect that Fox forced him to leave a United Nations summit in Mexico so that he would not be in the presence of President Bush, who also attended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=2002-04-25 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/1946089.stm | title = Mexico's Fox apologises to Castro | publisher = BBC News | accessdate = 2006-05-21 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nicaragua===
Cuba developed close relations with the 1979 [[Sandinista]] government in [[Nicaragua]] (having supported the Sandinista insurgency against Anastasio Somoza's rule). Cuba proved to be the organization's chief international ally in the civil war against the U.S.-backed [[Contra (guerrillas)|Contras]]. Cuba transported weapons to [[Panama]]. From Panama, the Cuban weapons would be taken through Costa Rica to Nicaragua{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}. Cuba continues to have close relations with the [[Sandinista National Liberation Front]], since being re-elected in 2006 for the first time since 1984, they are again the governing party of Nicaragua.

===Panama===
Cuba and [[Panama]] have restored diplomatic ties after breaking them off in 2004 when Panama's former president pardoned four Cuban exiles accused of attempting to assassinate Cuban President Fidel Castro. The foreign minister of each country re-established official diplomatic relations in Havana by signing a document describing a spirit of fraternity that has long linked both nations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cuba and Panama restore relations&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last = Gibbs| first = Stephen| authorlink = | coauthors = | month = August 21 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4170374.stm | title = Cuba and Panama restore relations | format = | work = | pages = | publisher = BBC News | language = | accessdate = 2006-05-21 | date=2005-08-21 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cuba, once shunned by many of its Latin American neighbours, now has full diplomatic relations with all but Costa Rica and El Salvador.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cuba and Panama restore relations&quot;/&gt; However, in March 2009, both governments of Costa Rica and El Salvador announced that they plan on re-establishing full diplomatic relations with Cuba.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7951908.stm|title=Cuba neighbours to restore ties |publisher= BBC News|date=2009-03-18|accessdate=2009-03-19 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Venezuela===
{{Main|Cuba–Venezuela relations}}

Relations between Cuba and Venezuela have significantly improved during the [[Presidency of Hugo Chávez]]. Chávez has formed a major alliance with Cuban president Fidel Castro and significant trade relationship with Cuba since his election in 1999.The warm relationship between the two countries continued to intensify.&lt;ref name=BRITANNICA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9403289/Cuba|title=Cuba|author=Daniel P.

Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez is a close ally of Fidel Castro, and has described the Fidel Castro–Hugo Chávez–[[Evo Morales]] relationship as an &quot;[[Axis of good]]&quot;. Chávez's formulation is a play on the &quot;[[axis of evil]]&quot; phrase used by President Bush when describing governments such as those of [[Iraq]], [[Iran]], and [[North Korea]] in his 2002 State of the Union Address. The [[Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela]] has agreed to barter Venezuelan oil, in exchange for Cuban medical assistance.

On December 15, 2004, an agreement called the ALBA ([[Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas]]) was signed to eliminate tariffs and import duties and promote investment as well as technical and educational cooperation between the two countries. Venezuela and Cuba have been close trading partners since a cooperative agreement was signed between them on October 30, 2000. The new agreement meant that Cuban goods and services were to be paid for with Venezuela products and currency. Venezuela will transfer technology, finance development projects in the agriculture, service, energy and infrastructures sectors. Cuba, in addition to providing over 15,000 medical professionals who participate in [[Barrio Adentro]], a social program which provides [[healthcare of Cuba|Cuban healthcare]] treatment to Venezuelans and trains doctors and specialists, will grant 2,000 annual scholarships to Venezuelan students. Also, the agreement commits the two countries to work together with other Latin American countries to fight [[illiteracy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.venezuelanalysis.com/news.php?newsno=1447 Venezuela and Cuba Sign New Cooperation Agreements]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 the two countries also signed cooperation agreements in the area of energy and electricity, an accord between Venezuela's oil company [[PDVSA]] and its Cuban counterpart [[Cupet]] to buy and sell crude oil and a crude oil storage agreement between the two companies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bilaterals.org/article.php3?id_article=1835 Cuba and Venezuela sign millionaire bilateral trade agreement]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hugo Chávez, who says he is one of the few people in the world who knows Castro's illness from July 31, 2006, has helped Cuba undermine a strict U.S. embargo by sending cheap oil and boosting commercial relations. Agreements between Cuba and Venezuela, the world's No. 5 oil exporter, have brought more than 20,000 Cuban doctors to Venezuela to provide medical services for the poor. The program, one of numerous oil-funded social projects, has helped Chávez build a strong political support base and he was widely expected to win a reelection bid in December 2006.&lt;ref name=reuters-09-03&gt;{{cite news|title=Castro recovering and giving orders: Chavez|date=2006-09-03

A White House point man on plans for a post-Castro transition, Caleb McCarry, recently told The Miami Herald that U.S. estimates of total Venezuelan subsidies to Cuba per year &quot;are up to the $2 billion figure.&quot; This is comparable to the $4 billion to $6 billion that the Soviet Union once pumped into Cuba per year.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.miami.com/mld/miamiherald/news/world/cuba/15395148.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
{{Main|Cuba – United States relations}}

Since the [[Cuban revolution]] of 1959 relations deteriorated substantially and have subsequently been marked by tension and confrontations. The United States does not have formal diplomatic relations with Cuba and has maintained an [[United States embargo against Cuba|embargo]] which makes it illegal for U.S. corporations to do business with Cuba. This includes travel restrictions. These measures were further strengthened by the implementation by the U.S. of the [[Helms-Burton Act]] of 1996 which attempted to punish any foreign companies operating in Cuba, especially those using expropriated US assets. US diplomatic representation in Cuba is handled by the [[United States Interests Section in Havana]], and a similar &quot;Cuban Interests Section&quot; remains in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]. Both are officially part of the respective embassies of Switzerland.

===Angola===
{{Main|Angola–Cuba relations}}

Angola-Cuba diplomatic relations are, for [[Angola]], second only to [[Angola-United States relations|relations with the United States]]. During [[Angola's civil war]], Cuban forces fought to install a Marxist-Leninist MPLA-PT government;  against [[Western world|Western]]-backed [[UNITA]] and [[FLNA]] guerrillas and an invading army of the [[South African]] [[South Africa under apartheid|apartheid]] state. For the time being South African forces were repelled though the UNITA insurgency continued; eventually Cuban forces withdrew from the country, especially as Cuba faced tremendous economic difficulties as a result of the Soviet Union's collapse. The outcome of Cuban withdrawal and the peace accords resulted in the MPLA changing from a Marxist-Leninist party to a Multi-Party Democratic system based on [[free market]] principles (the MPLA also dropped the &quot;PT&quot; extension to their name as a clear sign of dropping their Communist aspirations).  From an economic stand point, Cuba has lost its preferred status among Angolans and South Africa has become the biggest single investor and trading partner with Angola (outside of oil sales).

===Namibia===
 {{main|Cuba–Namibia relations}}
Cuban-Namibian relations began during the [[Namibian War of Independence]] when Cuba politically, militarily and diplomatically supported the [[Namibia]]n rebel organization and future ruling party, [[South West Africa People's Organization]] (SWAPO) against the [[Military of South Africa|military]] of [[Apartheid]] South Africa.&lt;ref name=&quot;radiohc.cu&quot;&gt;[http://www.radiohc.cu/ingles/noticias/julio05/5julio/cuba7.htm Cuba-Namibia Joint Commission Meeting Kicks off in Havana], Radio Habana, Cuba, 5 July 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Since independence, Namibia and Cuba have held joint meetings every two years for Economic, Scientific-Technical and Commercial Cooperation. In 2005, it was reported that 1,460 Cuban professionals had worked in Namibia, including 208 in 2005.&lt;ref name=&quot;radiohc.cu&quot;/&gt;

==Europe==
===European Union===
{{Main|Cuba–European Union relations}}
[[European Union]] (EU) relations with Cuba are governed by the Common Position, as approved by the [[European Council of Ministers]] in 1996, which is updated every six months following regular evaluations. According to the Common Position &quot;the objective of the European Union in its relations with Cuba is to encourage a process of transition to a pluralist democracy and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, as well as sustainable recovery and improvement in the living standards of the Cuban people&quot;. Cuba rejects the Common Position as interference in its internal affairs. There is an EU Delegation in Havana that works under the responsibility of the EC Delegation in [[Santo Domingo]], [[Dominican Republic]].

Cuba benefits from the GPS (Generalized Preference System) preferential treatment for its exports. Furthermore, Cuba does not benefit from the ACP-EU Sugar Protocol but from a sugar quota granted by the EU (some 59,000 tonnes per year; duty paid on this quota is EUR 98/t).&lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/comm/development/body/country/country_home_en.cfm?cid=cu&amp;status=new&lt;/ref&gt;

Cuba consistently supported Iraq at the [[UN]] against sanctions and threats made by the United States.&lt;ref name=CubaIraqRelations&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cubanet.org/opi/11099901.htm |title=The Encephalitis Outbreak, Hussein And Castro: A Cia /Cdc Cover-Up? |accessdate=2008-08-14 |publisher=cubanet.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The thirteen year [[sanction against Iraq]] prevented much trade between Havana and [[Baghdad]]. Iraq has an embassy in Havana. Cuba has an embassy in Baghdad&lt;ref&gt;[http://cuba.visahq.com/embassy/Iraq/ Embassy of Cuba in Iraq]&lt;/ref&gt; Both countries are full members of the [[Group of 77]].

===Kazakhstan===
* Cuba has an embassy in [[Astana]].
* Kazakhstan has a consulate-general in Havana.

===Pakistan===
{{Main|Cuba–Pakistan relations}}

The relations between the two countries strengthened after Cuba provided humanitarian assistance to the victims of the [[2005 Kashmir earthquake]]. Both nations continue to strengthen the bilateral relations especially in the fields of higher education, agriculture, industry and science and technology and have also held talks for military cooperation.

In March 2008, ambassador [[Gustavo Machin Gomez]] met General [[Tariq Majid]], the [[Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (Pakistan)|Chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC)]] at Joint Staff Headquarters and discussed issues related to military cooperation. Both of them expressed positive views over the increasing relations between the two nations and were optimistic that the bilateral cooperation will expand in different fields. Majid stressed that Pakistan has formed strong defence infrastructure both in defence production and in shape of military academies to provide help and cooperation to the [[Military of Cuba]]. He also said that both countries should use their capacity for expanding military cooperation.

===People's Republic of China===
{{Main|People's Republic of China – Cuba relations}}

As the economy of the Soviet Union fell into a decline during the 1990s, the [[People's Republic of China]] has emerged as a new a key partner for Cuba's foreign relations and the guardian of socialist countries around the world. Relations between Cuba and China continue to grow including deals for China to set up a possible military base in Cuba, similar to the [[Bejucal]] Base and an agreement was signed between China and Cuba for China open more factories producing local goods such as televisions. Cuba has also purchased from China a wide range of items including bicycles, rice cookers, energy-saving lightbulbs and diesel-electric locomotives with the aim of providing a boost to Cuba's national infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caribbeannetnews.com/2006/01/16/trains.shtml Cuba gets China's first trains exported to Latin America] Caribbean Net News&lt;/ref&gt;

===Organization of American States===
{{Main|Cuban relations with the Organization of American States}}
Cuba was formerly excluded from participation in the [[Organization of American States]] under a decision adopted by the Eighth Meeting of Consultation in [[Punta del Este]], [[Uruguay]], on 21 January 1962. The resolution stated that as Cuba had officially identified itself as a Marxist-Leninist government, is was incompatible with &quot;the principles and objectives of the inter-American system.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cidh.oas.org/countryrep/Cuba79eng/intro.htm&lt;/ref&gt; This stance was frequently questioned by some member states. This situation came to an end on 3 June 2009, when foreign ministers assembled in [[San Pedro Sula]], [[Honduras]], for the OAS's 39th [[General Assembly of the Organization of American States|General Assembly]], passed a vote to lift Cuba's suspension from the OAS. In its resolution ([http://www.oas.org/consejo/sp/AG/ag04632e01.doc AG/RES 2438]), the General Assembly decided that:
#Resolution VI, [...] which excluded the Government of Cuba from its participation in the Inter-American system, hereby ceases to have effect
#The participation of the Republic of Cuba in the OAS will be the result of a process of dialogue initiated at the request of the Government of Cuba, and in accordance with the practices, purposes, and principles of the OAS.

The reincorporation of Cuba as an active member had arisen regularly as a topic within the inter-American system (e.g., it was intimated by the outgoing ambassador of Mexico in 1998)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oas.org/OASpage/press2002/en/Press98/020498ce.htm OAS: Mexico Calls for Cuba's Reinstatement into the OAS&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; but most observers did not see it as a serious possibility while the Socialist government remained in power. On 6 May 2005, [[President of Cuba|President]] Fidel Castro reiterated that the island nation would not &quot;be part of a disgraceful institution that has only humiliated the honor of Latin American nations&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plenglish.com/article.asp?ID=%7B2355B35C-068E-4DFE-879E-3E8836A38EA4%7D&amp;language=EN Fidel Castro: OAS Is an Instrument of the US - Prensa Latina&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In an editorial published by ''[[Granma (newspaper)|Granma]]'', Fidel Castro applauded the Assembly's &quot;rebellious&quot; move and said that the date would &quot;be recalled by future generations.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.granma.cu/ingles/2009/junio/mier3/Reflections-2june.html |title=The Trojan horse |author=Fidel Castro |work=[[Granma (newspaper)|Granma]] |date=2009-06-02 |accessdate=2009-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a Declaration of the Revolutionary Government dated 8 June 2009 stated that while Cuba welcomed the Assembly's gesture, in light of the Organization's historical record  &quot;Cuba will not return to the OAS&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.granma.cu/ingles/2009/junio/lun8/Declaration.html |title=Declaration of the Revolutionary Government |work=[[Granma (newspaper)|Granma]] |date=2009-06-08 |accessdate=2009-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cuba joined the [[Latin American Integration Association]] becoming the tenth member (out of 12) on 26 August 1999. The organization was set up in 1980 to encourage trade integration association. Its main objective is the establishment of a common market, in pursuit of the economic and social development of the region.

On September 15, 2006, Cuba officially took over leadership of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] during the 14th summit of the organization in Havana.&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory?id=2448962&amp;CMP=OTC-RSSFeeds0312 ABC News: ABC News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cuban intervention abroad: 1959 - Early 1990s==
{{Ref improve section|date=June 2006}}

Aided by a massive buildup of Soviet advisors, military personnel, and advanced weaponry during the Cold War, Cuba became a staunch ally of the USSR during Castro's rule, modeling its political structure after that of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|CPSU]]. Due to this huge amount of support, Cuba became a major sponsor of Marxist &quot;wars of national liberation&quot; not only in Latin America, but worldwide.

===Black Panthers===
In the '60s and '70s, Cuba openly supported the black nationalist and Marxist-oriented [[Black Panther Party]] of the U.S. Many members found their way into Cuba for political asylum, where Cuba welcomed them after they had been convicted of crimes in the U.S.

===Palestinians===
Cuba has also lent support to [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] [[nationalism|nationalist]] groups against [[Israel]]. Fidel Castro claims Israel practices &quot;[[Zionism|Zionist]] Fascism.&quot; Cuba has also lent support to the prominent [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] (PLO) and the lesser-known [[Marxism-Leninism|Marxist-Leninist]] [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine]] (PFLP) both received training from Cuba's General Intelligence Directorate, as well as financial and diplomatic support from the Cuban government.

Cuba, along with North Korea and Venezuela, are the only non-Islamic states in the world that do not recognise the state of Israel.

In 2010, Castro indicated that he strongly supported Israel's right to exist. [http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gTESm0GlM9yQizdmGzrIOoEGdq0w]

===Irish Republicans===
The [[Irish Republican]] political party, [[Sinn Féin]] is also known to have close political links to the Cuban government. In the past Fidel Castro has expressed support for the Irish Republican cause of a [[United Ireland]]. The Cuban government supported and still supports the Republican cause, but opposed the attacks which took place on civilian targets by Sinn Féin's military ally, the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] and of course attacks on civilians by their [[Ulster loyalist|loyalist]] enemies such as the [[Ulster Volunteer Force]] and [[Ulster Defence Association]].

==Humanitarian aid==
Since the establishment of the Revolutionary Government of Cuba in 1959, the country has sent more than 52,000 medical workers abroad to work in needy countries, including countries affected by the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]] and the [[2005 Kashmir earthquake]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.irna.ir/en/news/view/menu-236/0607178261185837.htm&lt;/ref&gt; There are currently about 20,000 Cuban doctors working in 68 countries across three continents, including a 135-strong medical team in [[Java]], [[Indonesia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4792071.stm | work=BBC News | title=Cuba doctors popular in quake-stricken Java | date=2006-08-18 | accessdate=2010-05-02 | first=Tom | last=Fawthrop}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==US Accusations of supporting terrorism==
The [[U.S. list of state sponsors of international terrorism]] includes Cuba. According to the US, the Cuban Government has taken no action against [[al-Qaida]] or other terrorist groups. The Government of Cuba maintains close relationships with Iran and North Korea, and has provided safe haven to members of [[ETA]] after an agreement with the Spanish government (under [[Felipe González]]),&lt;ref name=&quot;Cuban&quot;&gt;''[http://www3.itu.int/MISSIONS/Cuba/Atlapa.htm Conferencia de Prensa] ofrecida por [[Felipe Pérez Roque]], Ministro de Relaciones Exteriores de Cuba. Centro de Convenciones &quot;[[Atlapa]]&quot; de la Ciudad de Panamá''. 7 November 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; [[FARC]], and the [[National Liberation Army (Colombia)|ELN]]. U.S. fugitives from justice and ETA members are living legally in Cuba. The [[United States Department of State]] has no information on their activities on Cuban territory.&lt;ref name=&quot;DoS&quot;&gt;[http://www.state.gov/s/ct/rls/crt/2005/64337.htm Country Reports on Terrorism: Released by the Office of the Coordinator for Counterterrorism] (April 28, 2006): ''The Government of Cuba maintains close relationships with other state sponsors of terrorism such as [[Iran]] and [[North Korea]], and has provided safe haven to members of'' ETA'', FARC, and the [[National Liberation Army (Colombia)|ELN]].'' There is no information concerning activities of these or other organizations on Cuban territory.  Press reports indicate that fugitives from US justice and ETA members are living legally in Cuba, just like fugitives from Cuban justice live legally in the US.  The United States says it is not aware of specific terrorist enclaves in the country.&lt;/ref&gt; Cuba refuses to extradite U.S. fugitives by stating that approval would be contingent upon the U.S. returning wanted Cuban criminals and that it will no longer provide safe haven to new U.S. fugitives who may enter Cuba.&lt;ref name=&quot;DoS&quot;/&gt;

==Etymology==
The etymology of the Greek name ''Kypros'' is unknown.
Suggestions include:
*the Greek word for the [[Cupressus|Mediterranean cypress tree]] (''[[Cupressus sempervirens]]''), ''κυπάρισσος'' (''kypárissos'')
*the Greek name of the [[henna]] plant (''Lawsonia alba''), ''κύπρος'' (''kýpros'')
* an [[Eteocypriot]] word for [[copper]]. Georges Dossin, for example, suggests that it has roots in the [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] word for [[copper]] (''zubar'') or for [[bronze]] (''kubar''), from the large deposits of copper ore found on the island.

The earliest attested reference to ''Cyprus'' is the [[Mycenaean Greek]] ''ku-pi-ri-jo'', meaning &quot;Cypriot&quot;, written in [[Linear B]] syllabic script.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.palaeolexicon.com/ Palaeolexicon], Word study tool of ancient languages&lt;/ref&gt;

Through overseas trade, the island has given its name to the [[Classical Latin]] word for copper through the phrase ''aes Cyprium'', &quot;metal of Cyprus&quot;, later shortened to ''Cuprum''.&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, Fred H. ''Cyprus: Our New Colony And What We Know About It''. London: George Routledge and Sons 1878, pp. 13–14.&lt;/ref&gt;
Cyprus, more specifically the shores of [[Paphos]], was also one of the birthplaces of [[Aphrodite]] given in Greek mythology, who was known as ''Kupria'', since according to [[Canaanite religion|Phoenician mythology]], [[Astarte]], goddess of love and beauty, was later [[interpretatio graeca|identified with]] Aphrodite.

The standard [[demonym]] relating to Cyprus or its people or culture is ''[[Cypriot]]''. The terms ''Cypriote'' and ''[[Cyprian (disambiguation)|Cyprian]]'' are also, less frequently, used.

Cyprus was ruled by [[Assyrian empire|Assyria]] for a century starting in 708 BC, before a brief spell under Egyptian rule and eventually [[Persian people|Persian]] rule in 545 BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;lcweb2.loc.gov&quot;/&gt; The Cypriots, led by [[Onesilus]], king of [[Salamis, Cyprus|Salamis]], joined their fellow Greeks in the [[Ionia]]n cities during the unsuccessful [[Ionian Revolt]] in 499 BC against the [[Achaemenid Empire]]. The revolt was suppressed, but Cyprus managed to maintain a high degree of autonomy and remained oriented towards the Greek world.&lt;ref name=&quot;lcweb2.loc.gov&quot;/&gt;

The island was brought under permanent Greek rule by [[Alexander the Great]] and the [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemies]] of Egypt following his death. Full [[Hellenization]] took place during the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic]] period, which ended when Cyprus was annexed by the [[Roman Republic]] in 58 BC.

===Middle Ages===
{{Main|Cyprus in the Middle Ages}}
[[File:Portrait of Caterina Coronaro 1542 uffizi florence Titian.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of [[Catherine Cornaro]], Queen of Cyprus.]]

When the [[Roman Empire]] was divided into Eastern and Western parts in 395, Cyprus became part of the East Roman, or [[Byzantine Empire]], and would remain part of it until the crusades some 800 years later. Under Byzantine rule, the Greek orientation that had been prominent since antiquity developed the strong Hellenistic-Christian character that continues to be a hallmark of the Greek Cypriot community.&lt;ref name=&quot;lcweb2.loc.gov&quot;/&gt; Beginning in 649, Cyprus suffered from devastating raids launched from the [[Levant]], which continued for the next 300 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;lcweb2.loc.gov&quot;/&gt; Many were quick piratical raids, but others were large-scale attacks in which many Cypriots were slaughtered and great wealth carried off or destroyed.&lt;ref name=&quot;lcweb2.loc.gov&quot;/&gt;

No Byzantine churches survive from this period, thousands of people were killed, and many cities – such as Salamis - were destroyed and never rebuilt.&lt;ref name=&quot;lcweb2.loc.gov&quot;/&gt; Byzantine rule was restored in 965, when Emperor [[Nikephoros II Phokas]] scored decisive victories on land and sea.&lt;ref name=&quot;lcweb2.loc.gov&quot;/&gt; In 1191, during the [[Third Crusade]], [[Richard I of England]] captured the island from [[Isaac Komnenos of Cyprus]]&lt;ref&gt;Riddle, J.M. ''A History of the Middle Ages.'' Lanham, MD, USA: Rowman &amp; Littlefield 2008. p. 326. [http://books.google.com/books?id=rhWpPr93KjMC&amp;pg=PA326&amp;dq=cyprus%2Bmiddle+ages#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; He used it as a major supply base that was relatively safe from the [[Saracen]]s. A year later Richard sold the island to the [[Knights Templar]], who, following a bloody revolt, in turn sold it to [[Guy of Lusignan]]. His brother and successor [[Amalric II of Jerusalem|Amalric]] was recognized as [[Kingdom of Cyprus|King of Cyprus]] by [[Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor]].&lt;ref name=&quot;lcweb2.loc.gov&quot;/&gt;

Following the death in 1473 of [[James II of Cyprus|James II]], the last Lusignan king, the [[Republic of Venice]] assumed control of the island, while the late king's Venetian widow, Queen [[Catherine Cornaro]], reigned as figurehead. Venice formally annexed Cyprus in 1489, following the abdication of Caterina.&lt;ref name=&quot;lcweb2.loc.gov&quot;/&gt; The Venetians fortified [[Nicosia]] by building the famous Venetian Walls, and used it as an important commercial hub. Throughout Venetian rule, the [[Ottoman Empire]] frequently raided Cyprus. In 1539 the [[Ottomans]] destroyed [[Limassol]] and so fearing the worst, the Venetians also fortified [[Famagusta]] and [[Kyrenia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;lcweb2.loc.gov&quot;/&gt;

During the almost four centuries of Latin rule, there existed two societies on Cyprus. The first consisted of Frankish nobles and their retinue, as well as Italian merchants and their families. The second, the majority of the population, consisted of Greek Cypriots, serfs and laborers. Although a determined effort was made to supplant native traditions and culture, the effort failed.&lt;ref name=&quot;lcweb2.loc.gov&quot;/&gt;

===Ottoman Empire===
{{Main|Ottoman Cyprus}}
[[File:Cyprus by Piri Reis.jpg|thumb|Historical map of Cyprus by [[Piri Reis]]]]

In 1570, a full scale Ottoman assault with 60,000 troops brought the island under Ottoman control, despite stiff resistance by the inhabitants of [[Nicosia]] and [[Famagusta]]. 20,000 Nicosians were [[Capital punishment|put to death]], and every church, public building, and palace was looted.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cyprus - OTTOMAN RULE&quot;&gt;[http://countrystudies.us/cyprus/7.htm Cyprus – OTTOMAN RULE], ''U.S. Library of Congress''&lt;/ref&gt; The previous Latin elite was destroyed and the first significant demographic change since antiquity took place when Ottoman [[Janissaries]] were settled on the island.&lt;ref name=Mallinson&gt;{{cite book | last = Mallinson | first = William | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Cyprus: A Modern History | publisher = I.

The Ottomans abolished the [[feudal]] system previously in place and applied the [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|millet system]] to Cyprus, under which non-[[Muslim]] peoples were governed by their own religious authorities. In a reversal from the days of Latin rule, the head of the [[Church of Cyprus]] was invested as leader of the Greek Cypriot population and acted as mediator between Christian Greek Cypriots and the Ottoman authorities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cyprus - OTTOMAN RULE&quot;/&gt; Ottoman rule of Cyprus was at times indifferent, at times oppressive, depending on the temperaments of the sultans and local officials, and during this period the island fell into economic decline.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cyprus - OTTOMAN RULE&quot;/&gt;

Reaction to Ottoman misrule led to uprisings by both Greek and Turkish Cypriots, although none were successful. By 1872, the population of the island had risen to 144,000 comprising 44,000 Muslims and 100,000 Christians.&lt;ref&gt;''Osmanli Nufusu 1830–1914'' by [[Kemal Karpat]], ISBN 975-333-169-X and ''Die Völker des Osmanischen'' by Ritter zur Helle von Samo.&lt;/ref&gt; Centuries of neglect by the Turks, the unrelenting poverty of most of the people, and the ever-present tax collectors fuelled Greek nationalism, and by 19th century the idea of ''[[enosis]]'', or union, with newly independent [[Greece]] was firmly rooted among Greek Cypriots.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cyprus - OTTOMAN RULE&quot;/&gt;

===British Empire===

[[File:Hosting the Birtish flag at Nicosia.jpg|thumb|upright|Hoisting the British flag at Nicosia]]

In the aftermath of the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)]] and the [[Congress of Berlin]], Cyprus was [[Cyprus Convention|leased]] to the [[British Empire]] which [[de facto]] took over its administration in 1878 (though, in terms of [[sovereignty]], it remained a [[de jure]] Ottoman territory until 1914, together with [[Khedivate of Egypt|Egypt and Sudan]]) in exchange for guarantees that Britain would use the island as a base to protect the Ottoman Empire against possible Russian aggression.&lt;ref name=&quot;lcweb2.loc.gov&quot;/&gt; The island would serve Britain as a key military base in its colonial routes. By 1906, when the Famagusta harbour was completed, Cyprus was a strategic naval outpost overlooking the [[Suez Canal]], the crucial main route to India which was then Britain's most important colony. Following the outbreak of [[World War I]] and the entry of the Ottoman Empire on the side of the [[Central Powers]], [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain]] formally annexed the island on 5 November 1914.&lt;ref name=&quot;lcweb2.loc.gov&quot;/&gt;

In 1915, Britain offered Cyprus to [[Constantine I of Greece]] on condition that Greece join the war on the side of the British, which he declined. In 1923, under the [[Treaty of Lausanne]], the nascent [[Turkey|Turkish republic]] relinquished any claim to Cyprus and in 1925 it was declared a British [[crown colony]].&lt;ref name=&quot;lcweb2.loc.gov&quot;/&gt; Many Greek Cypriots fought in the [[British Army]] during both World Wars, in the hope that Cyprus would eventually be united with [[Greece]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Ertl, Alan W. |title= Toward an Understanding of Europe: A Political Economic Précis of Continental Integration |publisher= Universal-Publishers|year= 2008 |url= http://books.google.com/?id=X9PGRaZt-zcC&amp;dq= | page = 418 |isbn= 9781599429830}}&lt;/ref&gt; During [[World War II]] many enlisted in the [[Cyprus Regiment]].

On 16 August 1960, Cyprus attained independence after the [[Zürich and London Agreement]] between the United Kingdom, Greece and Turkey. The UK retained the two [[Sovereign Base Areas]] of [[Akrotiri and Dhekelia]] while government posts and public offices were allocated by ethnic quotas giving the minority Turkish Cypriots a permanent veto, 30% in parliament and administration, and granting the three mother-states guarantor rights.

In 1963 inter-communal violence broke out, partially sponsored by both &quot;motherlands&quot; with Turkish Cypriots being forced into [[Turkish Cypriot enclaves|enclaves]] and Cypriot President Archbishop [[Makarios III]] calling for unilateral [[Zürich and London Agreement#13 Amendments proposed by Makarios III|constitutional changes]] as a means to ease tensions over the whole island.

The Turkish air force began bombing Greek positions on Cyprus, hundreds of paratroops were dropped in the area between Nicosia and [[Kyrenia]], where well-armed Turkish Cypriot enclaves had been long-established, while off the Kyrenia coast 30 Turkish troop ships protected by destroyers landed 6,000 men as well as tanks, trucks, and armored vehicles.

Three days later, when a ceasefire had been agreed, Turkey had landed 30,000 troops on the island and captured Kyrenia, the corridor linking Kyrenia to Nicosia, and Turkish Cypriot quarter of Nicosia itself. The junta in Athens, and then the Sampson regime in Cyprus fell from power. In Nicosia Glafkos Clerides assumed the presidency and constitutional order was restored; ostensibly removing the pretext the Turks gave for the invasion. The Turks used a period of negotiations to reinforce their Kyrenia bridgehead and prepare for the second phase of the invasion, which began on 14 August and resulted in the seizure of Morphou, Karpasia, Ammochostos and the Mesaoria. The Greek forces were unable to resist the Turkish advance.

International pressure led to a ceasefire at which point 37% of the island had been taken over by the Turks and 180,000 Greek Cypriots were evicted from their homes in the north.&lt;ref&gt; U.S. Congressional Record, V. 147, Pt. 3, March 8, 2001 to March 26, 2001 [http://books.google.com/books?id=fJ9DhiRRtIoC&amp;pg=PA4095&amp;dq=%22greek+cypriots%22+%2B+evicted&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=BC3bTajzN4v4swO-uMW-Dg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22greek%20cypriots%22%20%2B%20evicted&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, around 50,000 Turkish Cypriots moved to the areas under the control of the Turkish Forces and settled in the properties of the displaced Greek Cypriots.

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Cyprus}}
[[File:Cyprus lrg.jpg|thumb|right|Topographic image of Cyprus.]]

Cyprus is the third largest [[island]] in the [[Mediterranean Sea]], after the [[Italy|Italian]] islands of [[Sicily]] and [[Sardinia]] (both in terms of area and population). It is also the [[List of islands by area|world's 81st largest by area]] and [[List of islands by population|world's 49th largest by population]]. It measures {{convert|240|km|mi|0}} long from end to end and {{convert|100|km|mi|0}} wide at its widest point, with Turkey {{convert|75|km|mi|0}} to the north. It lies between latitudes [[34th parallel north|34°]] and [[36th parallel north|36° N]], and longitudes [[32nd meridian east|32°]] and [[35th meridian east|35° E]].

Other neighbouring territories include [[Syria]] and [[Lebanon]] to the east ({{convert|105|km|mi|0}} and {{convert|108|km|mi|0}}, respectively), [[Israel]] {{convert|200|km|mi|0}} to the southeast, [[Egypt]] {{convert|380|km|mi|0}} to the south, and [[Greece]] to the northwest: {{convert|280|km|mi|0}} to the small [[Dodecanese|Dodecanesian]] island of [[Kastelorizo]] (Megisti), {{convert|400|km|mi|0}} to [[Rhodes]], and {{convert|800|km|mi|0}} to the Greek mainland.

[[File:Konnos bay Protaras Cyprus in early July.jpg|thumb|left|[[Paralimni]]]]
The physical relief of the island is dominated by two mountain ranges, the [[Troodos Mountains]] and the smaller [[Kyrenia Mountains|Kyrenia Range]], and the central plain they encompass, the [[Mesaoria]]. The Troodos Mountains cover most of the southern and western portions of the island and account for roughly half its area. The highest point on Cyprus is [[Mount Olympus (Cyprus)|Mount Olympus]] at {{convert|1952|m|abbr=on}}, located in the centre of the Troodos range. The narrow Kyrenia Range, extending along the northern coastline, occupies substantially less area, and elevations are lower, reaching a maximum of {{convert|1024|m|abbr=on}}.

[[Geopolitics|Geopolitically]], the island is subdivided into four main segments. The Republic of Cyprus, the internationally recognized government, occupies the southern two-thirds of the island (59.74%). The [[Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus]] occupies the northern third (34.85%) of the island and is recognized only by Turkey, as it consists of the Turkish-occupied areas. The [[United Nations]]-controlled [[Green Line (Cyprus)|Green Line]] is a buffer zone that separates the two and covers 2.67% of the island. Lastly, [[Sovereign Base Areas|two bases under British sovereignty]] are located on the island: [[Akrotiri and Dhekelia]], covering the remaining 2.74%.

===Biodiversity===
{{Main|Wildlife of Cyprus}}
[[File:Cyprus wild mouflon Agrino.jpg|thumb|The [[mouflon]] is a national symbol]]
One of the unique features of Cyprus' habitats is the wild and sharp differences in elevations and habitats in different parts of the island as well as different climate conditions, all of which supply a diverse habitat for a unique array of fauna and flora. The number of plant species and sub-species of wild plant in Cyprus is possibly in the thousands, many of them being endemic. Wildlife can be seen in Troodos Mountains, Larnaca salt lake, Akrotiri salt lake and undoubtedly Akamas national park.
Cyprus is home to Cyprus mouflon which is a [[national symbol]] of the country. The mouflon is protected and can be seen in [[Paphos]] forests towards the Troodos Mountains.

===Climate===
{{Main|Climate of Cyprus}}
Cyprus has a [[Subtropics|subtropical climate]] - [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean]] and [[Semi-arid climate|Semi-arid]] type (in the north-eastern part of island) - according to [[Köppen climate classification]] signes ''Csa'' and ''Bsh'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Peel, M.

Snow is possible only in the Troodos Mountains in the central part of island. Rain occurs mainly in winter, with summer being generally dry.

Cyprus has the warmest climate (and warmest winters) in the Mediterranean part of the European Union. The average annual temperature on the coast is around {{convert|24|°C|°F|abbr=on}} during the day and {{convert|14|°C|°F|abbr=on}} at night. Generally – summer's/holiday season lasts about 8 months, begins in April with average temperatures of {{convert|21|-|23|C|F}} during the day and {{convert|11|-|13|C|F}} at night, ends in November with average temperatures of {{convert|22|-|23|C|F}} during the day and {{convert|12|-|14|C|F}} at night, although also in remaining 4 months temperatures sometimes exceeds {{convert|20|°C|0|abbr=on}}. Among all cities in the Mediterranean part of the European Union, Limassol has the warmest winters, in the period January–February average temperature is {{convert|17|-|18|C|F}} during the day and {{convert|8|-|9|C|F}} at night, in other coastal locations in Cyprus is generally {{convert|16|-|17|C|F}} during the day and {{convert|7|-|9|C|F}} at night. In March and December in Limassol average temperatures is {{convert|19|-|20|C|F}} during the day and {{convert|10|-|11|C|F}} at night, in other coastal locations in Cyprus is generally {{convert|17|-|19|C|F}} during the day and {{convert|8|-|11|C|F}} at night. Middle of summer is hot - in July and August on the coast the average temperature is usually around {{convert|33|°C|°F|abbr=on}} during the day and around {{convert|23|°C|°F|abbr=on}} at night (inside the island, in the highlands average temperature exceeds {{convert|35|°C|°F|abbr=on}}) while in the June and September on the coast the average temperature is usually around {{convert|30|°C|°F|abbr=on}} during the day and around {{convert|20|°C|°F|abbr=on}} at night. Large fluctuations in temperature are rare. Temperatures inside the island are more stringent, with colder winters and more hot summers compared with the coast of the island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Average annual temperature of sea is {{convert|21|-|22|C|F}}, from {{convert|17|°C|°F|abbr=on}} in February to {{convert|27|-|28|C|F}} in August (depending on the location). In total 7 months - from May to November - the average sea temperature exceeds {{convert|20|°C|°F|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;weather2travel&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weather2travel.com/climate-guides/cyprus/ |title=Cyprus Climate Guide |accessdate=5 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Water supply===
[[File:Kouris.jpg|thumb|[[Kouris Dam]] is the largest of a network of 107 dams in Cyprus]]

Cyprus is suffering from an ongoing shortage of water. The country relies heavily on rain to provide household water and for many years now, the average annual rainfall seemed to be falling. Between 2001 and 2004, exceptionally heavy annual rainfall pushed water reserves up, with supply exceeding demand, allowing total storage in the island's reservoirs to rise to an all time high by the start of 2005.
However, since then demand has increased annually - a result of local population growth, foreigners relocating to Cyprus and the number of visiting tourists - while supply has fallen. Cyprus has a total of 107 dams (plus one currently under construction) and reservoirs, with a total water storage capacity of about {{convert|330000000|m3|-9|abbr=on|lk=out}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moa.gov.cy/moa/wdd/Wdd.nsf/All/F1C37F7EC2249715C2256CC50039DDD5?OpenDocument&amp;highlight=108%20dams Dams of Cyprus] Water Development Department, Republic of Cyprus.&lt;/ref&gt; Dams remain the principal source of water both for domestic and agricultural use. Water desalination plants are gradually being constructed in order to deal with recent years of prolonged drought.
The Government has invested heavily in the creation of water desalination plants which have supplied almost 50 percent of domestic water since 2001. Efforts have also been made to raise public awareness of the situation and to encourage domestic water users to take more responsibility for the conservation of this increasingly scarce commodity.

==Politics==
{{Main|Politics of Cyprus}}
Cyprus is a [[Presidential republic]]. The head of state and of the government is elected by a process of [[Universal suffrage]] for a five-year term. Executive power is exercised by the government with legislative power vested in the House of Representatives whilst the Judiciary is independent of both the executive and the legislature.
[[File:presidential-palace.jpg|thumb|left|The Presidential Palace (Residence) in [[Nicosia]].]]
The 1960 Constitution provided for a presidential system of government with independent executive, legislative and judicial branches as well as a complex system of checks and balances including a weighted power-sharing ratio designed to protect the interests of the Turkish Cypriots. The executive was led by a Greek Cypriot president and a Turkish Cypriot vice president elected by their respective communities for five-year terms and each possessing a right of veto over certain types of legislation and executive decisions. Legislative power rested on the House of Representatives who were also elected on the basis of separate voters' rolls.

Following clashes between the two communities the [[Turkish Cypriot]] seats in the House remain vacant since 1965. Turkish Cypriots refused to establish the state of affairs before the invasion of Cyprus as is evident in the Secretary-General of the United Nations who said &quot;The Turkish Cypriot leaders have adhered to a rigid stand against any measures which might involve having members of the two communities live and work together, or which might place Turkish Cypriots in situations where they would have to acknowledge the authority of Government agents. Indeed, since the Turkish Cypriot leadership is committed to physical and geographical separation of the communities as a political goal, it is not likely to encourage activities by Turkish Cypriots which may be interpreted as demonstrating the merits of an alternative policy. The result has been a seemingly deliberate policy of self-segregation by the Turkish Cypriots.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Coe1&quot;&gt;Quotation from 1965 in a report submitted by Cyprus in the framework of the Convention for the Protectino of Mational Minorities citing [http://www.humanrights.coe.int/minorities/eng/FrameworkConvention/StateReports/1999/cyprus/B.htm United Nations Secretary General Report S/6426]{{dead link|date=April 2011}}, 10 June 1965&lt;/ref&gt; By 1974 the two communities had returned to a more tolerant state of living.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coe1&quot; /&gt;

In 1974 Cyprus was divided ''de facto'' when the Turkish army occupied the northern third of the island. The Turkish Cypriots subsequently declared independence in 1983 as the [[Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus]] but were recognized only by [[Turkey]]. In 1985 the TRNC adopted a constitution and held its first elections. The United Nations recognises the sovereignty of the Republic of Cyprus over the entire island of Cyprus.

The House of Representatives currently has 59 members elected for a five year term, 56 members by [[proportional representation]] and 3 observer members representing the [[Armenians in Cyprus|Armenian]], [[Roman Catholicism in Cyprus|Latin]] and [[Maronites in Cyprus|Maronite]] minorities. 24 seats are allocated to the [[Turkish people|Turkish]] community but remain vacant since 1964. The political environment is dominated by the communist [[Progressive Party of Working People|AKEL]], the liberal conservative [[Democratic Rally]], the [[centrism|centrist]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=DotNetNuke |url=http://www.diko.org.cy/DesktopDefault.aspx?tabid=24 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070611174508/http://www.diko.org.cy/DesktopDefault.aspx?tabid=24 |archivedate=2007-06-11 |title=Democratic Party (DH.KO) &gt; Το Κόμμα &gt; Διακήρυξη |publisher=Diko.org.cy |date= |accessdate=6 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Democratic Party (Cyprus)|Democratic Party]], the [[social democracy|social-democratic]] [[Movement for Social Democracy|EDEK]] and the centrist [[European Party (Cyprus)|EURO.KO]].
On 17 February 2008 [[Dimitris Christofias]] of the [[Progressive Party of Working People|AKEL]] was elected President of Cyprus, on AKEL's first electoral victory without being part of a wider coalition. Christofias took over government from [[Tassos Papadopoulos]] of the [[Democratic Party (Cyprus)|Democratic Party]] who had been in office since February 2003.

===Administrative divisions===
{{Main|Districts of Cyprus|List of cities, towns and villages in Cyprus}}

===Exclaves and enclaves===
[[File:20061019 Episkopi Bay.jpg|thumb|right|[[Episkopi Cantonment]] in south-southwest Cyprus.]]

Cyprus has four [[exclave]]s, all in territory that belongs to the [[Akrotiri and Dhekelia|British Sovereign Base Area of Dhekelia]]. The first two are the villages of [[Ormidhia]] and [[Xylotymvou]]. The third is the Dhekelia Power Station which is divided by a British road into two parts. The northern part is an exclave, like the two villages, whereas the southern part is located by the sea and therefore not an exclave although it has no [[territorial waters]] of its own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geosite.jankrogh.com/cyprus.htm |title=Cyprus |publisher=Geosite.jankrogh.com |date= |accessdate=6 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UN buffer zone runs up against Dhekelia and picks up again from its east side off [[Ayios Nikolaos (Cyprus)|Ayios Nikolaos]] and is connected to the rest of Dhekelia by a thin land corridor. In that sense the buffer zone turns the [[Paralimni]] area on the southeast corner of the island into a ''de facto'', though not ''[[de jure]]'', exclave.

The [[Cypriot National Guard]] is the main military institution of the Republic of Cyprus. It is a &lt;!-- all Greek  : If it is Greek then refs must be provided. I suspect that this is meant to say ethnic Greek.--&gt;[[combined arms]] force, with land, air and naval elements. The National Guard is a required 24 month service for all men upon completing their 18th birthday.The land forces of the Cypriot National Guard comprise the following units:
*First Infantry Division (Ιη Μεραρχία ΠΖ)

==Economy==
{{Main|Economy of Cyprus}}
[[File:Lemesospa.jpg|thumb|The city of [[Limassol]] is a major port and touristic hub in the Mediterranean.]]

The Cypriot economy is prosperous and has diversified in recent years.&lt;ref name=econ/&gt; According to the latest [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] estimates, its [[List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita|per capita GDP]] (adjusted for [[purchasing power parity|purchasing power]]) at [[international dollar|$]]28,381 is just above the average of the European Union.&lt;ref&gt;List of countries by future GDP (PPP) per capita estimates&lt;/ref&gt; Cyprus has been sought as a base for several offshore businesses for its highly developed infrastructure.
Economic policy of the Cyprus government has focused on meeting the criteria for admission to the European Union. The Cypriot government adopted the [[euro]] as the national currency on 1 January 2008.&lt;ref name=econ&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cyprus.gov.cy/portal/portal.nsf/All/2E23E22A811DE449C2256EBD004F3BEB?OpenDocument |title=Cyprus Economy |accessdate=4 May 2007 |work=Republic of Cyprus |publisher=www.cyprus.gov.cy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Euro banknotes.png|thumb|left|Cyprus has been part of the [[Eurozone]] since 2008.]]

The economy of the Turkish-occupied areas operates on a [[free market|free-market]] basis although it continues to be handicapped by the lack of private and public investment, high freight costs and shortages of skilled labor. Despite these constraints the economy turned in an impressive performance in 2003 and 2004 with growth rates of 9.6% and 11.4%. The average income in the area was $15,984 (S₣16,289) in 2008.&lt;ref name=TRNC-Economy&gt;[http://www.devplan.org/GSMH/En/GNP%201.pdf ''Economic and Social Indicators 1977  (S₣43)–2008'']{{dead link|date=April 2011}}, TRNC State Planning Organization.&lt;/ref&gt; Growth has been buoyed by the relative stability of the [[Turkish new lira]] and by a boom in the education and construction sectors.
The island has witnessed a massive growth in tourism over the years and as such the property rental market in Cyprus has grown alongside.
Added to this is the capital growth in property that has been created from the demand of incoming investors and property buyers to the island.&lt;ref name=tourism&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.apropertyincyprus.com/cyprus/ |title=Growth in tourism has stimulated the property market in Cyprus |accessdate=15 December 2008 |date=10 November 2008 |publisher=www.apropertyincyprus.com |work=Property Abroad}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[euro]] was introduced in 2008. Three different designs were selected for the Cypriot coins, chosen from entrants in a competition in 2005. The €2 (S₣2.59) coin is a legacy of an old national practice of minting silver and gold commemorative coins. To commemorate this event, a €5 (S₣6.48) collector coin was also issued. Unlike normal issues these coins are not legal tender in all of the eurozone and so cannot be used in any other country but Cyprus.

In 1999, Cyprus had six heliports and two international airports: [[Larnaca International Airport]] and [[Paphos International Airport]]. [[Nicosia International Airport]] has been closed since 1974 and although Ercan airport was still in use it was only for flights from Turkey.

Per capita private car ownership is the 5th highest in the world. In 2006 extensive plans were announced to improve and expand bus services and restructure public transport throughout Cyprus, with the financial backing of the [[European Union]] Development Bank. In 2010 the new revised and expanded bus network got implemented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cyprusbybus.com/|title=Cyprus By Bus|work=Cyprus By Bus|accessdate=16 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main [[harbour]]s of the island are ''[[Limassol Port|Limassol]] harbour'' and ''[[Larnaca]] harbour'', which service cargo, passenger, and [[cruise ship]]s.

===Communications===
{{Main|Communications in Cyprus}}
[[Cyta]], the [[Public ownership|state-owned]] telecommunications company, manages most [[Telecommunications]] and [[Internet]] connections on the island. However, following the recent [[liberalisation]] of the sector, a few private telecommunications companies have emerged including [[MTN Group|MTN]], [[Cablenet]], [[TelePassport]], [[OTEnet Telecom]], [[Omega Telecom]] and [[PrimeTel]]. In the Turkish-controlled area of Cyprus, three companies are also present. These are [[Turkcell]], [[Vodafone]] and [[Turk Telekom]].

According to the first population census after the declaration of independence, carried out in December 1960 and covering the entire island, Cyprus had a total population of 573,566; of whom 442,138 (77.1%) were Greek Cypriots, 104,320 (18.2%) Turkish Cypriots, and 27,108 (4.7%) others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |last=Hatay|first=Mete|year=2007|title=Is the Turkish Cypriot Population Shrinking?|url=http://www.prio.no/upload/Is%20the%20Turkish%20Cypriot%20Population%20Shrinking.pdf|location=|publisher=International Peace Research Institute|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://countrystudies.us/cyprus/21.htm Eric Solsten, ed.

Due to the inter-communal ethnic tensions between 1963 and 1974, an island-wide census was regarded as impossible. Nevertheless, the Greek Cypriots conducted one in 1973, without the Turkish Cypriot populace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=St John-Jones|first=L.W.|year=1983|title=The Population of Cyprus: Demographic Trends and Socio-Economic Influences|place=London|publisher=Maurice Temple Smith Ltd|page=17|isbn=0851172326}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this census, the Greek Cypriot population was 482,000. One year later, in 1974, the Cypriot government's Department of Statistics and Research estimated the total population of Cyprus at 641,000; of whom 506,000 (78.9%) were Greek Cypriots, and 118,000 (18.4%) Turkish Cypriots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |author=Cyprus Ministry of Interior|year=1992|title=The Demographic Structure of Cyprus|url=http://www.moi.gov.cy/moi/pio/pio.nsf/All/20C7614D06858E9FC2256DC200380113/$file/cuco%20report.pdf?OpenElement|location=|publisher=Parliamentary Assembly|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the partition of the island in 1974, Greek Cypriots conducted four more censuses: in 1976, 1982, 1992 and 2001; these excluded the Turkish Cypriot population which was resident in the northern part of the island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hatay|first=Mete|year=2007|title=Is the Turkish Cypriot Population Shrinking?|url=http://www.prio.no/upload/Is%20the%20Turkish%20Cypriot%20Population%20Shrinking.pdf|location=|publisher=International Peace Research Institute|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Republic of Cyprus's latest estimate, in 2005, the number of Cypriot citizens currently living in the Republic of Cyprus is around 656,200. In addition to this the Republic of Cyprus is home to 110,200 foreign permanent residents&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |author=Republic of Cyprus Statistical Service|year=2006|title=Demographic Report 2005|url=|location=Nicosia|publisher=Republic of Cyprus Statistical Service|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an estimated 10,000-30,000 undocumented illegal immigrants currently living in the south of the island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |last1=Nicos|first1=Trimikliniotis|last2=Demetriou|first2=Corina |year=2007|title=Active Civic Participation of Immigrants in Cyprus|url=http://www.politis-europe.uni-oldenburg.de/download/Cyprus.pdf|location=|publisher=POLITIS|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the 2006 census carried out by Northern Cyprus, there were 256,644 ([[de jure]]) people living in Northern Cyprus. 178,031 were citizens of Northern Cyprus, of which 147,405 were born in Cyprus (112,534 from the north; 32,538 from the south; 371 did not indicate what part of Cyprus they were from); 27,333 born in Turkey; 2,482 born in the UK and 913 born in Bulgaria. Of the 147,405 citizens born in Cyprus, 120,031 say both parents were born in Cyprus; 16,824 say both parents born in Turkey; 10,361 have one parent born in Turkey and one parent born in Cyprus.&lt;ref name=TRNC2006&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nufussayimi.devplan.org/Census%202006.pdf |title=Census.XLS |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=25 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Human Y-chromosome DNA haplogroup|Y-Dna haplogroups]] are found at the following frequencies in Cyprus : [[Haplogroup J (Y-DNA)|J]] (43.07% including 6.20% J1), [[Haplogroup E1b1b (Y-DNA)|E1b1b]] (20.00%), [[Haplogroup R1 (Y-DNA)|R1]] (12.30% including 9.2% R1b), [[Haplogroup F (Y-DNA)|F]] (9.20%), [[Haplogroup I (Y-DNA)|I]] (7.70%), [[Haplogroup K (Y-DNA)|K]] (4.60%), [[Haplogroup A (Y-DNA)|A]] (3.10%).&lt;ref&gt;(n=65), [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16626331 Population structure in the Mediterranean basin: a Y chromosome perspective], Capelli et al. 2005&lt;/ref&gt; J, K, F and E1b1b haplogroups consist of lineages with differential distribution within [[Middle East]], [[North Africa]] and [[Europe]] while R1 and I are typical in West European populations.

Outside Cyprus there is a significant and thriving [[Greek Cypriot diaspora]] and [[Turkish Cypriot diaspora]] in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Australia]], [[Canada]], the [[United States]], [[Greece]] and [[Turkey]].

===Education===
{{For|a complete list|List of universities and colleges in Cyprus}}
[[File:Indoorstadiumunicy.jpg|thumb|left|[[University of Cyprus]] modern facilities.]]
[[File:Faneromeni School.jpg|thumb|[[Faneromeni School]], the oldest functioning all-girl primary school in Cyprus.]]

Cyprus has a highly developed system of primary and [[secondary education]] offering both public and [[private school|private education]]. The high quality of instruction can be attributed to a large extent to the above-average competence of the teachers{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} but also to the fact that nearly 7% of the GDP is spent on education which makes Cyprus one of the top three spenders of education in the EU along with Denmark and Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.childinfo.org/files/IND_Cyprus.pdf UNICEF, Division of Policy and Practice, Statistics and Monitoring Section] childinfo.org, May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[State school]]s are generally seen as equivalent in quality of education to private-sector institutions. However, the value of a state high-school diploma is limited by the fact that the grades obtained account for only around 25% of the final grade for each topic, with the remaining 75% assigned by the teacher during the semester, in a minimally transparent way. Cypriot universities (like universities in Greece) ignore high school grades almost entirely for admissions purposes. While a high-school diploma is mandatory for university attendance, admissions are decided almost exclusively on the basis of scores at centrally administered university entrance examinations that all university candidates are required to take.

The majority of Cypriots receive their higher education at Greek, British, Turkish, other European and North American universities. It is noteworthy that Cyprus currently has the highest percentage of citizens of [[Legal working age|working age]] who have higher-level education in the EU at 30% which is ahead of Finland's 29.5%. In addition 47% of its population aged 25–34 have tertiary education, which is the highest in the EU. The body of Cypriot students is highly mobile, with 78.7% studying in a university outside Cyprus.

==Culture==
{{POV-section|date=January 2011}}
The culture of Cyprus is divided between the two distinct cultures of Greek and Turkish Cypriots. Each community maintains its own culture, linked to the cultures of Greece and Turkey, and there is little cultural interchange between the two groups. Due to the complex history of the island, cultures have shifted over time. The Greek culture first became prominent in the running of the island in the 1400s. The Turkish culture arrived with the invasion of the Ottoman Empire in 1570, and it was under this rule that the divide between the two communities became prominent and encouraged by government policies. The British did nothing to change this, leaving the island in its divided state with no unified culture.&lt;ref name=&quot;CyprusinEurope&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law.vanderbilt.edu/publications/journal-of-transnational-law/archives/volume-35-number-1/download.aspx?id=2001 |title=Cyprus in Europe: Seizing the Momentum of Nice |author=Patrick R. Hugg |publisher=Vanderbilt Journal of Transnational Law |date=November 2001 |accessdate=26 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Art===

The art history of Cyprus can be said to stretch back up to 10,000 years, following the discovery of a series of [[Chalcolithic]] period carved figures in the villages of [[Khoirokoitia]] and [[Lempa (Lemba)|Lempa]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arcl.ed.ac.uk/arch/lemba/homepage.html |title=Lemba Archaeological Research Centre |publisher=Arcl.ed.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=25 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the island is also the home to numerous examples of high quality religious [[icon painting]] from the [[Middle Ages]]. Cypriot architecture was heavily influenced by [[French Gothic architecture|French Gothic]] and Italian [[renaissance architecture|renaissance]] introduced in the island during the era of Latin domination (1191-1571).
[[File:Aphrodite.jpeg|thumb|upright|left|[[Aphrodite]]; Greek goddess of love, beauty and sexuality is said to be born in Cyprus.]]

In modern times Cypriot art history begins with the painter Vassilis Vryonides (1883–1958) who studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in Venice.&lt;ref&gt;Chrysanthos Christou, ''A short History of Modern and Contemporary Cypriot Art,'' Nicosia 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; Arguably the two founding fathers of modern Cypriot art were Adamantios Diamantis (1900–1994) who studied at London's [[Royal College of Art]] and Christopheros Savva (1924–1968) who also studied in London, at [[St Martins School of Art]].&lt;ref&gt;Ministry of Education and Culture, ''State Gallery of Contemporary Cypriot Art'' (Nicosia: MOEC,1998)&lt;/ref&gt; In many ways these two artists set the template for subsequent Cypriot art and both their artistic styles and the patterns of their education remain influential to this day. In particular the majority of Cypriot artists still train in [[England]]&lt;ref&gt;Michael Paraskos, 'The Art of Modern Cyprus', in ''Sunjet,'' Spring 2002, 62f&lt;/ref&gt; although art schools in [[Greece]] are also popular and local art institutions such as the [[Cyprus College of Art]], [[University of Nicosia]] and the [[Frederick Institute of Technology]] are becoming more popular.

One of the features of Cypriot art is a tendency towards figurative painting although [[conceptual art]] is being rigorously promoted by a number of art “institutions” and most notably the Nicosia Municipal Art Centre [http://www.nimac.com.cy/]. Municipal art galleries exist in all the main towns and there is a large and lively commercial art scene. Cyprus was due to host the international art festival [[Manifesta]] in 2006 but this was cancelled at the last minute following a dispute between the Dutch organizers of Manifesta and the Cyprus Ministry of Education and Culture over the location of some of the Manifesta events in the Turkish sector of the capital [[Nicosia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;schools out&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.frieze.com/issue/article/schools_out | title= Schools Out | date=2006-09 | publisher=[http://www.frieze.com/]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Manifestaartnet&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.artnet.com/magazineus/news/zenakos/zenakos6-5-06.asp | title= Manifesta no more | publisher=[http://www.artnet.com/]}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- The ensuing furore over this event resulted in questions in Cyprus as to whether Manifesta was a [[CIA]]-backed plot to undermine the Greek Cypriot side in on-going negotiations over the reunification of Cyprus.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Paraskos, 'Was Manifesta a CIA Plot?' in ''Artcyprus,'' issue 2, Autumn 2006, 2&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dead link|date=February 2011}} : see chat--&gt;

Other notable Cypriot artists include Rhea Bailey, Mihail Kkasialos, Ioannis Kissonergis, Theodoulos Gregoriou, [[Helene Black]], George Skoteinos, [[Kalopedis family]], [[Nicos Nicolaides]], [[Stass Paraskos]], [[Arestís Stasí]], [[Telemachos Kanthos]], [[Konstantia Sofokleous]] and [[Chris Achilleos]].

===Music===
{{Main|Music of Cyprus}}
[[File:Trichordobouzouki-upright.jpg|right|80px|thumb|[[Bouzouki]], the mainstay of most Cypriot folk music.]]

The traditional [[folk music]] of Cyprus has several common elements with [[Music of Greece|Greek]], [[Music of Turkey|Turkish]], and [[Arabic Music|Arabic]] music including Greco-Turkish dances such as the ''[[sousta]]'', ''[[syrtos]]'', ''[[zeibekikos]]'', ''tatsia'', and ''kartsilamas'' as well as the [[Middle Eastern]]-inspired ''[[tsifteteli]]'' and ''arapie''. There is also a form of musical poetry known as ''chattista'' which is often performed at traditional feasts and celebrations. The instruments commonly associated with Cyprus folk music are the [[bouzouki]] (''pictured''), [[oud]] (&quot;outi&quot;), [[violin]] (&quot;fkiolin&quot;), [[lute]] (&quot;laouto&quot;), [[accordion]], Cyprus [[flute]] (&quot;pithkiavlin&quot;) and [[percussion]] (including the &quot;[[goblet drum|toumperleki]]&quot;). Composers associated with traditional Cypriot music include [[Evagoras Karageorgis]], [[Marios Tokas]], Solon Michaelides and Savvas Salides.

[[Popular music]] in Cyprus is generally influenced by the Greek ''[[Laïka]]'' scene with several artists including [[Anna Vissi]], [[Evridiki]], and [[Sarbel]] earning widespread popularity in Cyprus, Greece and parts of the [[Middle Eastern music|Middle East]]. [[Hip Hop]], [[R&amp;B]] and [[reggae]] are also very popular genres on the island and have been supported by the emergence of Cypriot [[rap music|rap]] and the [[urban music]] scene at [[Ayia Napa]]. Cypriot [[rock music]] and ''[[Éntekhno]]'' rock is often associated with artists such as [[Michalis Hatzigiannis]] and [[Alkinoos Ioannidis]]. [[Heavy metal music|Metal]] also has a small following in Cyprus represented by bands such as [[Winter's Verge]] and Quadraphonic.

===Literature===
{{Main|Cypriot literature}}
[[File:Zeno of Citium pushkin.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Zeno of Citium]], founder of the [[Stoicism|Stoic]] school of philosophy.]]

Literary production of the antiquity includes the [[Cypria]], an [[epic poetry|epic poem]], probably composed in the late seventh century BC and attributed to [[Stasinus]]. The [[Cypria]] is one of the very first specimens of Greek and European poetry.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;An indication that at least the main contents of the ''Cypria'' were known around 650 BCE is provided by the representation of the [[Judgment of Paris]] on the [[Chigi vase]]&quot; (Burkert 1992:103). On the [[proto-Corinthian]] [[ewer]] of ca. 640 BCE known as the [http://www.wisc.edu/arth/ah300/13-myth/33.image.html Chigi &quot;vase&quot;]{{dead link|date=April 2011}}, Paris is identified as ''Alexandros'', as he was apparently called in ''Cypria''.&lt;/ref&gt; The Cypriot [[Zeno of Citium]] was the founder of the Stoic School of Philosophy.

Epic poetry, notably the &quot;acritic songs&quot;, flourished during [[Middle Ages]]. Two chronicles, one written by [[Leontios Machairas]] and the other by Georgios Voustronios, cover the entire Middle Ages until the end of Frankish rule (4th century - 1489). Poèmes d'amour written in medieval Greek Cypriot date back from 16th century. Some of them are actual translations of poems written by [[Petrarch]], [[Bembo]], [[Ariosto]] and G. [[Sannazzaro]].&lt;ref&gt;Th. Siapkaras- Pitsillidés, Le Pétrarchisme en Cypre. Poèmes d' amour en dialecte Chypriote d' après un manuscript du XVIe siècle, Athènes 1975 (2ème édition)&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern literary figures from Cyprus include the poet and writer Kostas Montis, poet [[Kyriakos Charalambides]], poet Michalis Pasiardis, writer [[Nicos Nicolaides]], [[Stylianos Atteshlis]], [[Altheides]], Loukis Akritas&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philatelism.com/details.php?issueid=256|title=Cyprus Stamp Issue: Loukis Akritas}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Demetris Th. Gotsis. [[Dimitris Lipertis]], [[Vasilis Michaelides]] and Pavlos Liasides are folk poets who wrote poems mainly in the [[Cypriot Greek|Cypriot-Greek]] dialect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philatelism.com/details.php?issueid=91|title=Cyprus Stamp Issue: Cyprus Poets}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philatelism.com/details.php?issueid=252|title=Cyprus Stamp Issue: Centenary Birthday Anniversary of Poet Pavlos Liasides}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lawrence Durrell]] lived in Northern Cyprus from 1952 until 26 August 1956 and wrote the book [[Bitter Lemons]] concerning his time there which won the second [[Duff Cooper Prize]] in 1957. The majority of the play ''[[Othello]]'' by [[William Shakespeare]] is set on the island of Cyprus. Cyprus also figures in religious literature such as the [[Acts of the Apostles]] according to which the Apostles [[Barnabas]] and Paul preached on the island.

Halloumi (Hellim) is commonly served sliced, either fresh or grilled, as an appetiser.

[[File:Luntza und Hieromeri.jpg|thumb|upright|Meat meze with sliced luntza, chiromeri, onions and olives]]

Seafood and fish dishes of Cyprus include [[squid]], [[octopus]], [[red mullet]], and [[European seabass|sea bass]]. Cucumber and tomato are used widely in salads. Common vegetable preparations include potatoes in olive oil and parsley, pickled [[cauliflower]] and [[beets]], [[asparagus]] and ''[[Taro]]''. Other traditional delicacies of the island are meat marinated in dried coriander, seeds and wine, and eventually dried and smoked, such as ''lountza'' (smoked [[pork loin]]), charcoal-grilled lamb, [[souvlaki]] (pork and chicken cooked over charcoal), and [[sheftalia]] (minced meat wrapped in [[mesentery]]). ''Pourgouri'' ([[bulgur]], cracked wheat) is the traditional carbohydrate other than bread, and is used to make the Cypriot delicacy [[Kibbeh|koubes]].

Fresh vegetables and fruits are common ingredients in Cypriot cuisine.

The '''geography of Cyprus''' entails the [[physical geography|physical]] and [[human geography]] of [[Cyprus]], an [[island country]] situated in the Eastern Basin of the [[Mediterranean Sea]].  The third largest [[island]] in the Mediterranean (after the [[Italy|Italian]] islands of [[Sicily]] and [[Sardinia]]) and the [[List of islands by area|world's 81st largest]], it is located south of the [[Anatolia]]n [[peninsula]] (Asia Minor), or modern-day [[Turkey]], of the [[Asia]]n (or [[Eurasia]]n) mainland.  As such, it may be included in [[Southwest Asia|Western Asia]]&lt;ref&gt;http://millenniumindicators.un.org/unsd/methods/m49/m49regin.htm#asia UN&lt;/ref&gt; or the [[Middle East]]:&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/cy.html CIA World Factbook&lt;/ref&gt;  At a confluence of Western Asia, [[Southern Europe]], and [[Northern Africa]], Cyprus has had lengthy periods of mainly [[Greece|Greek]] and intermittent Anatolian, [[Levant]]ine, [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]], and [[United Kingdom|British]] influences.  It is sometimes included in [[Europe]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/195686/Europe Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt; and has been a [[member state of the European Union]] since 1 May 2004.

Cyprus measures 240 kilometres [[Transversality|latitudinally]] and {{convert|100|km|0|abbr=on}} longitudinally, with Turkey {{convert|75|km|0|abbr=on}} to the north.  Other neighbouring territories include [[Syria]] and [[Lebanon]] to the east (105&amp;nbsp;km and {{convert|108|km|0|abbr=on}}, respectively), [[Israel]] {{convert|200|km|0|abbr=on}} to the southeast, [[Egypt]] {{convert|380|km|0|abbr=on}} to the south, and [[Greece]] to the west-northwest: {{convert|280|km|0|abbr=on}} to the small [[Dodecanese|Dodecanesian]] island of [[Kastellórizo|Kastellórizo (Meyísti)]], {{convert|400|km|0|abbr=on}} to [[Rhodes]], and {{convert|800|km|0|abbr=on}} to the Greek mainland.

The physical setting for life on the island is dominated by the mountain masses and the central plain they encompass, the [[Mesaoria]]. The [[Troodos Mountains]] cover most of the southern and western portions of the island and account for roughly half its area. The narrow [[Kyrenia Mountains|Kyrenia Range]], extending along the northern coastline, occupies substantially less area, and elevations are lower. The two mountain systems run generally parallel to the [[Taurus Mountains]] on the Turkish mainland, whose silhouette is visible from northern Cyprus. Coastal lowlands, varying in width, surround the island.

[[Geopolitics|Geopolitically]], the island is subdivided into four main segments.  The Republic of Cyprus, the internationally recognized government, occupies the southern two-thirds of the island.  The [[Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus]] occupies the northern third of the island and is recognised only by Turkey.  The [[United Nations]]-controlled [[Green Line (Cyprus)|Green Line]] is a buffer zone that separates the two.  Lastly, [[Sovereign Base Areas|two bases under British sovereignty]] are located on the island: [[Akrotiri and Dhekelia]].

==Terrain==
[[Image:Satellite image of Cyprus, cropped.jpg|300px|thumb|This image, acquired by [[Terra (satellite)|NASA's Terra satellite]] on 30 January 2001, shows the three distinct geologic regions of the island. In the central and western part of the island is the Troodos Massif, a mountain range whose surface layer is mostly basaltic lava rock, and whose maximum elevation is {{convert|1952|m|ft|0|abbr-on}}. Running in a thin arc along the northeast margin of the island is Cyprus's second mountain range, a limestone formation called the Kyrenia Range. The space between these ranges is home to the capital [[Nicosia]], visible as a grayish-brown patch near the image's center.]]
[[Image:Cyprus topo.png|300px|thumb|Topography]]
The rugged [[Troodos Mountains]], whose principal range stretches from Pomos Point in the northwest almost to Larnaca Bay on the east, are the single most conspicuous feature of the landscape. Intensive uplifting and folding in the formative period left the area highly fragmented, so that subordinate ranges and spurs veer off at many angles, their slopes incised by steep-sided valleys. In the southwest, the mountains descend in a series of stepped foothills to the coastal plain.

While the Troodos Mountains are a massif formed of molten igneous rock, the Kyrenia Range is a narrow limestone ridge that rises suddenly from the plains. Its easternmost extension becomes a series of foothills on the [[Karpass Peninsula]]. That peninsula points toward Asia Minor, to which Cyprus belongs geologically.

Even the highest peaks of the [[Kyrenia Range]] are hardly more than half the height of the great dome of the Troodos massif, [[Mount Olympus (Cyprus)|Mount Olympus]] ({{convert|1952|m|ft|0|abbr=on|disp=s}}),&lt;ref name=&quot;Embassy climate&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title = Country Profile: Climate|publisher = Official Website of the Embassy of the Republic of Cyprus in Washington D.C.|url = http://www.cyprusembassy.net/home/index.php?module=page&amp;pid=11|accessdate = 2006-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; but their seemingly inaccessible, jagged slopes make them considerably more spectacular. [[United Kingdom|British]] writer [[Lawrence Durrell]], in Bitter Lemons, wrote of the Troodos as &quot;an unlovely jumble of crags and heavyweight rocks&quot; and of the Kyrenia Range as belonging to &quot;the world of [[Gothic art|Gothic]] [[Europe]], its lofty crags studded with crusader castles.&quot;

Rich copper deposits were discovered in antiquity on the slopes of the Troodos. The massive sulfide deposits formed as a part of an [[ophiolite]] complex at a [[Mid-ocean ridge|spreading center]] under the Mediterranean Sea which was [[Tectonics|tectonically]] uplifted during the [[Pleistocene]] and emplaced in its current location.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.moa.gov.cy/moa/gsd/gsd.nsf/dmlTroodos_en/dmlTroodos_en?OpenDocument Cyprus Geologic Survey&lt;/ref&gt;

==Drainage==
In much of the island, access to a year-round supply of water is difficult. This is traditionally attributed to deforestation which damaged the island's drainage system through erosion, but Grove and Rackham question this view.&lt;ref&gt;A.T. Grove, Oliver Rackham, ''The Nature of Mediterranean Europe: An Ecological History'', Yale, 2001.  ISBN 0300084439.&lt;/ref&gt; A network of winter rivers rises in the Troodos Mountains and flows out from them in all directions. The Yialias River and the [[Pedieos|Pedhieos River]] flow eastward across the Mesaoria into Famagusta Bay; the Serraghis River flows northwest through the [[Morphou]] plain. All of the island's rivers, however, are dry in the summer. An extensive system of dams and waterways has been constructed to bring water to farming areas.

The Mesaoria is the agricultural heartland of the island, but its productiveness for wheat and barley depends very much on winter rainfall; other crops are grown under irrigation. Little evidence remains that this broad, central plain, open to the sea at either end, was once covered with rich forests whose timber was coveted by ancient conquerors for their sailing vessels. The now-divided capital of the island, Nicosia, lies in the middle of this central plain.

== Natural vegetation ==

Notwithstanding its small size, Cyprus has a variety of natural vegetation. This includes forests of conifers and broadleaved trees such as ''[[Pinus brutia]]'', [[Cedrus|cedar]], [[cypress]]es and [[oak]]s. Ancient authors write that most of Cyprus, even Messaoria, was heavily forested, and there are still considerable forests on the Troodos and Kyrenia ranges, and locally at lower altitudes. About 17% of the whole island is being classified as woodland. Where there is no forest, tall shrub communities of [[golden oak]] (''Quercus alnifolia''), strawberry tree (''[[Arbutus andrachne]]''), terebinth (''[[Pistacia terebinthus]]''), olive (''[[Olea europaea]]''), kermes oak (''[[Quercus coccifera]]'') and styrax (''[[Styrax officinalis]]'') are found, but such [[Maquis shrubland|maquis]] is uncommon. Over most of the island untilled ground bears a grazed covering of [[garrigue]], largely composed of low bushes of [[Cistus]], ''[[Genista sphacelata]]'', ''[[Calycotoime villosa]]'', ''[[Lithospermum hispidulum]]'', ''[[Phaganalon rupestre]]'' and, locally, ''[[Pistacia lentiscus]]''. Where grazing is excessive this covering is soon reduced, and an impoverished [[Garrigue|batha]] remains, consisting principally of ''[[Thymus capitatus]]'', ''[[Sarcopoterium spinosum]]'', and a few stunted herbs.

==Climate==

[[Image:Cyprus.A2002292.1045.500m.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Dust storm|Sandstorm]] in the [[Levant]], October 19, 2002]]
The [[Mediterranean climate]], warm and rather dry, with rainfall mainly between November and March, favors agriculture. In general, the island experiences mild wet winters and dry hot summers. Variations in temperature and rainfall are governed by altitude and, to a lesser extent, distance from the coast. Hot, dry summers from mid-May to mid-September and rainy, rather changeable winters from November to mid-March are separated by short autumn and spring seasons.

The '''Demographics of Cyprus''' is about the [[demographics|demographic]] features of the [[population]] of [[Cyprus]], including population growth, [[population density]], [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]], education level, health, economic status, religious affiliations, and other aspects of the population.

The people of Cyprus are broadly divided into two main ethnic communities, Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots, who share many customs but maintain distinct identities based on ethnicity, religion, language, and close ties with their respective motherlands. Before the dispute started in 1964 the peoples of Cyprus (then 77% Greek Cypriots, 18% Turkish Cypriots, 5% other nationalities, including [[Armenians in Cyprus|Armenians]] and [[Maronite Church|Maronites]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://countrystudies.us/cyprus/21.htm Eric Solsten, ed. ''Cyprus: A Country Study''], Library of Congress, Washington, DC, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; were dispersed over the entire island. The [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus]] in 1974 [[de facto]] partitioned the island into two political areas: 99.5% of Greek Cypriots now live in the Republic of Cyprus, while 98.7% of Turkish Cypriots live in Northern Cyprus (of other nationalities, 99.2% live in the Greek Cypriot area in the south).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldpress.org/profiles/cyprus.cfm Cyprus Facts] on Worldpress.org. Retrieved 29 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt; [[Greek language|Greek]] is predominantly spoken in the South, where the majority are Greek Cypriots, [[Turkish language|Turkish]] in the north, where the majority are Turkish Cypriots &lt;!-- and immigrants from [[Turkey]] : see chat --&gt;. [[English language|English]] is widely used over all of the island. 

The total population of Cyprus as of the end of 2006 is slightly over 1 million, comprising 789,300 in the territory controlled by the government of the Republic of Cyprus&lt;ref name=&quot;DEMOGRAPHIC REPORT 2007&quot;&gt;Statistical Service of the Republic of Cyprus, [http://www.mof.gov.cy/mof/cystat/statistics.nsf/All/1A87FF0C4E254CC1C22571FE002D4AD4/$file/DEMOGRAPHIC_REPORT-2007.pdf DEMOGRAPHIC REPORT 2007] (p. 12)&lt;/ref&gt; and 265,100 in Northern Cyprus. The population of Northern Cyprus includes some 150,000-160,000 Turkish immigrants who are regarded as &quot;illegal settlers&quot; by the Republic of Cyprus government and are not included in the population statistics of the Republic of Cyprus Statistical Service.&lt;ref name=cyportal&gt;[http://www.cyprus.gov.cy/portal/portal.nsf/All/817E9279C04E4480C2257023002B858C?OpenDocument&amp;a=4&amp;z= Cyprus Government web portal: Towns and Population].

==Immigration==
Large-scale demographic changes have been caused since 1964 by the movements of peoples across the island and the later influx of settlers from Turkey to Northern Cyprus. The South has seen an influx of British and Arab (mostly [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] and [[Lebanon|Lebanese]]) immigration, as well as migrant workers from [[Poland]], [[Russia]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Nigeria]], [[China]] and the [[Philippines]]. According to the 2007 Demographic report there were 125,300 non-Cypriot residents about 14.3% of the total population of Cyprus as stated by the Cyprus government which does not include Northern Cyprus.&lt;ref name=&quot;DEMOGRAPHIC REPORT 2007&quot;/&gt; &lt;!--  The demographic changes in society have led to some racist incidents,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cyprus-mail.com/news/main.php?id=43171 &quot;My girl thought she was going to die&quot;]{{Dead link|date=December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cyprus-mail.com/news/main.php?id=34878&amp;cat_id=1 &quot;Why the Republic of Cyprus is institutionally racist&quot;]{{Dead link|date=December 2009}}&lt;/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cyprus-mail.com/news/main.php?id=44660 &quot;Teen says beaten and mocked by police in racist incident&quot;]{{Dead link|date=December 2009}}&lt;/&lt;/ref&gt; and the formation of the charity [[KISA (NGO)|KISA]] in response. : see chat--&gt;

The demographic character of [[Northern Cyprus]] changed after the [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus|Turkish invasion]] in 1974 and especially during the last 10–15 years. The TRNC census carried out in April 2006 showed that out of a total de jure (permanent) population of 256,644 in Northern Cyprus, 132,635, or 52%, were Turkish Cypriots in the sense that they were born in Cyprus of at least one Cyprus-born parent (for 120,007 of these both parents were Cyprus-born). In addition, 43,062 TRNC citizens (17%) had at least one non-Cypriot Turkish-born parent, 2,334 TRNC citizens (1%) had parents born in other countries, 70,525 residents (27%) had Turkish citizenship, and 8,088 (3%) were citizens of other countries (mainly UK, Bulgaria, and Iran).&lt;ref name=TRNC2006/&gt; Based on these census data, it can be argued that 113,687 TRNC residents, or 44% of the population, are not Turkish Cypriots properly speaking, but are in fact &quot;Turkish immigrants&quot; or &quot;Turkish settlers&quot; from Anatolia. Alternative sources suggest that there are 146,122 Turkish settlers from Anatolia in TRNC (2007 figures)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.calisma.gov.tr/ Çalışma Sosyal Güvenlik Bakanlığı&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=March 2009}} and that the Turkish Cypriots in Northern Cyprus are today outnumbered by the Turkish settlers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Turkish Settlers in Northern Cyprus |publisher=www.cyprus-conflict.net}}, quoting &quot;Fresh Tension for Cyprus: Counting the Newcomers&quot; in ''The New York Times'', January 23, 1991. {{wayback |url=http://web.archive.org/web/20080325092512/http://www.cyprus-conflict.net/turkish_settlers.htm |date=20080325092512}}&lt;/ref&gt; contrary to the picture presented by the 2006 TRNC census.

Almost one-third of the Turkish settlers in Northern Cyprus have been granted TRNC citizenship by the authorities of Northern Cyprus and have thus been naturalized.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zaman.com/?bl=hotnews&amp;alt=&amp;trh=20060506&amp;hn=32847 Today'S Zaman&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=March 2009}} Settlement in Northern Cyprus, especially if accompanied by naturalization, is a violation to the [[Geneva Conventions]] Protocol of 1977, since the Turkish occupation has been declared illegal by the UN. The Republic of Cyprus government regards these Turkish immigrants as &quot;illegal settlers&quot; and does not include them in the population estimates for the entire island published by the Republic of Cyprus Statistical Service.&lt;ref name=2007abstract/&gt;

==Religion==
{{Main|Religion in Cyprus}}
The Greek Cypriot community adheres to the [[Autocephalous]] Greek Orthodox [[Church of Cyprus]] and the Turkish Cypriot community adheres to [[Islam]]. The religious groups of Armenians, Maronites and Latins (about 9,000 people in total) opted, in accordance with the [[Constitution of Cyprus|1960 constitution]], to belong to the Greek Cypriot community.&lt;ref name=cyportal/&gt;

According to the 2001 census carried out in the Government controlled area,&lt;ref name=2001census/&gt; 94.8% of the population are [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Christian Orthodox]], 0.9% [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenians]] and [[Maronite Church|Maronites]], 1.5% [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]], 1.0% [[Church of England]], and 0.6% [[Muslim]]s. The remaining 1.3% adhere to other religious denominations or did not state their religion.

==Education==
{{See|Cyprus#Education}}
[[Cyprus]] has a well-developed system of primary and secondary education. The majority of Cypriots earn their higher education at Greek, Turkish, British, or American universities, while there are also sizeable emigrant communities in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Australia]]. Private colleges and state-supported universities have been developed by both the Turkish and Greek communities.

{{Refimprove|date=August 2007}}
'''Politics of the Republic of Cyprus''' takes place in a framework of a [[presidential system|presidential]] [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] [[republic]], whereby the [[President of Cyprus]] is both [[head of state]] and [[head of government]], and of a  [[multi-party system]]. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government.  [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the [[government]] and the [[House of Representatives of Cyprus|House of Representatives]]. The [[Judiciary]] is independent of the executive and the legislature.
[[Cyprus]] is a divided island. Since 1974, the legal government (The [[Cyprus|Republic of Cyprus]]) has controlled the south two thirds, and the [[Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus]] the northern one-third. The Government of the [[Cyprus|Republic of Cyprus]] has continued as the sole internationally-recognized authority on the island (as well as the UK being internationally recognized with respect to the [[Sovereign Base Area|SBA]]s), though in practice its power extends only to the government controlled area.

==United Cyprus==
The 1960 Cypriot [[Constitution]] provided for a [[presidential system]] of government with [[separation of powers|independent]] [[executive (government)|executive]], [[legislative]], and [[judicial]] branches, as well as a complex system of checks and balances including a weighted power-sharing ratio designed to protect the interests of the [[Turkish Cypriots]]. The executive, for example, was headed by a Greek Cypriot president, [[Archbishop Makarios]] III, and a Turkish Cypriot vice president, [[Fazil Kucuk|Dr Fazıl Küçük]], elected by their respective communities for 5-year terms and each possessing a right of veto over certain types of legislation and executive decisions. 

The House of Representatives was elected on the basis of separate voters' rolls. Since 1964, following clashes between the two communities, the Turkish Cypriot seats in the House remained vacant, while the Greek Cypriot Communal Chamber was abolished. The responsibilities of the chamber were transferred to the newfounded Ministry of Education.

By 1967, when a [[Greek military junta of 1967-1974|military junta]] had seized power in Greece, the political impetus for enosis had faded, partly as a result of the non-aligned foreign policy of Cypriot President Makarios. Enosis remained an ideological goal, despite being pushed significantly further down the political agenda. Dissatisfaction in Greece with Makarios convinced the Greek colonels to sponsor the 1974 coup in Nicosia.

Turkey responded by launching a military operation on Cyprus in a move not approved by the other two international guarantor powers, Greece and the United Kingdom using as a pretext the protection of the Turkish minority from Greek militias. The invasion is called &quot;Cyprus Peace Operation&quot; by the Turkish side. Turkish forces captured the northern part of the island. Many thousands of others, from both sides, left the island entirely. In addition to many of the Greek Cypriot refugees (a third of the population), many Turkish Cypriots (on whose pretext Turkey invaded) also moved to the UK and other countries where for the past 30 years they have lived as neighbours with the Greek Cypriots. In the meantime Turkey illegally imported Turkish colonists to populate the occupied territories, thereby altering the ethnic make up of the occupied north. Under the [[Geneva conventions|Geneva Conventions]] of 1949, it is a war crime to transfer, directly or indirectly, the civilian population of a country power onto land under that country's military occupation.

Subsequently, the Turkish Cypriots established their own separatist institutions with a popularly elected ''[[de facto]]'' President and a Prime Minister responsible to the National Assembly exercising joint executive powers. In 1983, the Turkish Cypriots declared an independent state called the [[Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus]] (TRNC), an action opposed by the United Nations Security Council. In 1985, the TRNC adopted a constitution and held its first elections.

==Division of Cyprus==
[[Image:buffer zone.jpg|thumbnail|right|180px|The capital Nicosia remains divided since 1973. The UN buffer zone separates the two sectors.]]

In 1974, following a coup sponsored by the [[Greek military junta of 1967-1974]] and executed by the [[Cypriot National Guard]] the [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus|invasion of troops from Turkey]] (citing its authority as one of the three guarantor powers established by the Constitution), the Turkish Cypriots formally set up their own institutions with a popularly-elected [[separatist]] president and a Prime Minister, responsible to the National Assembly, exercising joint executive powers.  Cyprus has been divided, ''de facto'', into the Greek Cypriot controlled southern two-thirds of the island and the Turkish-occupied northern third.  The '''Republic of Cyprus''' is the internationally-recognised government of the Republic of Cyprus, that controls the southern two-thirds of the island. Aside from Turkey, all foreign governments and the United Nations recognise the sovereignty of the Republic of Cyprus over the whole island of Cyprus. 

Turkey, which does not recognise the Republic of Cyprus, and the Turkish Cypriot administration of the northern part of the island, do not accept the Republic's rule over the whole island and refer to it not by its international name, but as the &quot;Greek Cypriot Administration of Southern Cyprus&quot;. Its territory, a result of the Turkish invasion of 1974 and whose status remains disputed, extends over the northern third of the island.

The north proclaimed its independence in 1975. In 1983, the Turkish Cypriots declared an independent &quot;Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus&quot;, which has never been [[non-recognized nations|recognized by any country]] except [[Turkey]]. In 1985, they adopted a constitution and held elections—an arrangement recognized only by Turkey.  For information pertaining to this, see [[Politics of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus]]. The [[Organization of the Islamic Conference]] granted it observer member status under the name of &quot;Turkish Cypriot State&quot;.

==Political conditions==
The division of Cyprus has remained an [[intractable conflict|intractable]] political problem plaguing relations between Greece and [[Turkey]], and drawing in [[NATO]], of which both Greece and Turkey are members, and latterly the [[European Union]], which has admitted Greece and Cyprus and which Turkey has been seeking to join for over twenty years.

The most recent developments on the island have included the reopening of the [[Green Line (Cyprus)|border]] between the two sides, and the failure of an attempt to reunify the island under the terms of a [[Annan Plan for Cyprus|United Nations-sponsored initiative]] guided by the UN [[Secretary-General]], [[Kofi Annan]]. 

None of the Greek Cypriot parties has been able to elect a president by itself or dominate the 56-seat House of Representatives. The 165,000 Greek [[Cypriot refugees]] are also a potent political force, along with the independent [[Orthodox Church of Cyprus]], which has some influence in temporal as well as ecclesiastical matters.

The working of the Cypriot state was fraught with difficulty from the very early days after independence in 1960, and intercommunal tension and occasionally violence was, regrettably, a feature of the first decade of Cypriot independence. In 1963, the Cypriot president, [[Makarios III|Makarios]], proposed 13 amendments to the Constitution in order to solve intractable difficulties in filling government posts. Whether this was an attempt to foster increasing unity by dissolving legal boundaries between communities, or to effect domination of the Turkish Cypriots by the majority Greek Cypriots, remains controversial. Whatever Makarios's intentions, violence erupted between Greek and Turkish Cypriots in December 1963 and by the following year the [[United Nations]] agreed to undertake peacekeeping operations ([[United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus|UNFICYP]]).

[[United Nations|UN]]-sponsored negotiations to develop institutional arrangements acceptable to the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities began in 1968; several sets of negotiations and other initiatives followed.

After the 1974 [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus|invasion]] following a Greek [[Military dictatorship|junta]]-based [[coup d'état|coup]] attempt, Makarios secured international recognition of his Greek Cypriot government as the sole legal authority on Cyprus, which has proved to be a very significant strategic advantage for the Greek Cypriots in the decades since. Negotiations continued in the years after 1974 with varying degrees of regularity and success, but none resulted in a full reunification. 
On 15 November 1983 the Turkish Cypriot North declared independence and the formation of the [[Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus]] (TRNC), which has been [[non-recognized nations|recognized]] only by [[Turkey]]. Both sides publicly call for the resolution of intercommunal differences and creation of a new [[federation|federal system]] (Greek Cypriot position) or [[confederation|confederate system]] (Turkish Cypriot position) of government.

Following the [[Cypriot presidential election, 1998|1998 presidential election]], [[Glafkos Klerides|Klerides]] tried to form a government of national unity, by including six ministers from Klerides' [[Democratic Rally]] party, two ministers from the [[socialism|socialist]] [[Movement for Social Democracy|EDEK]], three from the [[Democratic Party (Cyprus)|Democratic Party]] (who broke ranks with party leader [[Spyros Kyprianou]]) and one from the [[United Democrats]]. However, a national unity government was not achieved do to the leftist [[AKEL]] and centrist Democratic Party rejecting the offer, preferring to remain opposition parties.

==Reunification, the Annan Plan and EU entry==
The results of early negotiations between the Greek and Turkish politicians resulted in a broad agreement in principle to reunification as a bicameral, bi-zonal [[federation]] with territory allocated to the Greek and Turkish communities within a united island. However, agreement was never reached on the finer details, and the two sides often met deadlock over the following points, among others:

The Greek side:
* took a strong line on the right of return for refugees to properties vacated in the 1974 displacement of Cypriots on both sides, which was based on both UN Resolutions and decisions of the European Court of Human Rights;
* took a dim view of any proposals which did not allow for the repatriation of Turkish settlers from the mainland who had emigrated to Cyprus since 1974; and
* supported a stronger central government.

The Turkish side:
* favoured a weak central government presiding over two sovereign states in voluntary association, a legacy of earlier fears of domination by the majority Greek Cypriots; and
* opposed plans for demilitarisation, citing security concerns.

The continued difficulties in finding a settlement presented a potential obstacle to Cypriot entry to the [[European Union]], for which the government had applied in 1997. UN-sponsored talks between the Greek and Turkish leaders, [[Glafkos Klerides]] and [[Rauf Denktaş]], continued intensively in 2002, but without resolution. In December 2002, the EU formally invited Cyprus to join in 2004, insisting that EU membership would apply to the whole island and hoping that it would provide a significant enticement for reunification resulting from the outcome of ongoing talks. However, weeks before the UN deadline, Klerides was defeated in presidential elections by centre candidate [[Tassos Papadopoulos]]. Papadopoulos had a reputation as a hard-liner on reunification and based his stance on international law and human rights. By mid-March, the UN declared that the talks had failed.

A United Nations plan sponsored by [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|Secretary-General]] [[Kofi Annan]] was announced on 31 March 2004, based on what progress had been made during the talks in Switzerland and fleshed out by the UN, was put for the first time to civilians on both sides in separate referendums on 24 April 2004. The Greek side overwhelmingly rejected the [[Annan Plan for Cyprus|Annan Plan]], and the Turkish side voted in favour.

{{quote|Communal federalists seem to be supportive of bi-zonality in its strongest
form even at the expense of serious limitations on individual rights. Strong bizonality requires a minimal effort for the territorial coexistence of the Cypriot
communities, a feature especially important for the Turkish-Cypriot community
to form a clear majority in its constituent state. Thus, limiting the number
of Greek-Cypriots in the Turkish-Cypriot constituent unit, and preventing
them from using their political rights in the north, appears to be a necessary
territorial mechanism that would secure bi-zonality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In May 2004, Cyprus entered divided the EU, although in practice membership only applies to the southern part of the island which is in the control of the Republic of Cyprus. In acknowledgment of the Turkish Cypriot community's support for reunification, however, the EU made it clear that trade concessions would be reached to stimulate economic growth in the north, and remains committed to reunification under acceptable terms. Though some trade restrictions were lifted on the north to alleviate economic isolation for the Turkish Cypriots, further negotiations have not been a priority. There is now a focus on convincing Turkey to recognise the government of Cyprus, a requirement for Turkish admission advocated most strongly by Cyprus and France.

==Constitution==
The 16 August 1960 constitution envisioned power sharing between the Greek Cypriots and [[Turkish Cypriots]].  Efforts to amends the constitution sparked the intercommunal strife in 1963.  This constitution is still in force, though there is no Turkish Cypriot presence in the Cypriot government.

The president, elected by popular vote for a five-year term, is both the chief of state and head of government; post of vice president is currently vacant; under the 1960 constitution, the post is reserved for a Turkish Cypriot. The Council of Ministers is appointed jointly by the president and vice president.

Currently there are eleven ministries: 
#Ministry of Agriculture, Natural Resources and the Environment
#Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Tourism
#Ministry of Communications and Works
#Ministry of Defence
#Ministry of Education and Culture
#Ministry of Finance 
#Ministry of Foreign Affairs
#Ministry of Health

#Ministry of Justice and Public Order
#Ministry of Labour and Social Insurance

==Legislative branch==
The [[House of Representatives of Cyprus|House of Representatives]] (''Vouli Antiprosópon/Temsilciler Meclisi'') has 59 members elected for a five-year term: 56 Greek Cypriot members chosen by [[proportional representation]] and 3 observer members representing the [[Maronite]], [[Roman Catholic]] and [[Armenians|Armenian]] minorities. 24 seats are allocated to the Turkish community, but are currently vacant.

==Political parties and elections==
{{elect|List of political parties in Cyprus|Elections in Cyprus}}

==Political pressure groups and leaders==
Confederation of Cypriot Workers or SEK (pro-West); Confederation of Revolutionary Labor Unions or Dev-Is; Pan-Cyprian Labor Federation or PEO (Communist controlled)

==Administrative divisions==
6 districts; [[Famagusta]] (Ammochostos), [[Kyrenia]], [[Larnaca]], [[Limassol]] (Lemesos), [[Nicosia]] (Lefkosia), [[Paphos]]; note - occupied area's administrative divisions include Kyrenia, all but a small part of Famagusta (Ammochostos), and small parts of Lefkosia (Nicosia) and Larnaca.

==Exclaves and enclaves==
Cyprus has four [[exclave]]s, all in territory that belongs to the [[Akrotiri and Dhekelia|British Sovereign Base Area of Dhekelia]]. The first two are the villages of [[Ormidhia]] and [[Xylotymvou]]. Additionally there is the Dhekelia Power Station, which is divided by a British road into two parts. The northern part is an enclave, like the two villages, whereas the southern part is located by the sea and therefore not an enclave &amp;mdash;although it has no territorial waters of its own [http://geosite.jankrogh.com/cyprus.htm].

The UN buffer zone separating the territory controlled by the Turkish Cypriot administration from the rest of Cyprus runs up against Dhekelia and picks up again from its east side, off of [[Ayios Nikolaos, SBA|Ayios Nikolaos]] (connected to the rest of Dhekelia by a thin land corridor). In that sense, the buffer zone turns the south-east corner of the island, the [[Paralimni]] area, into a ''de facto'', though not ''[[de jure]]'', exclave.

==International organization participation==

Economic affairs in [[Cyprus]] are dominated by the division of the country into the southern area controlled by the Cyprus Government and the north area of Cyprus, illegally administered by Turkish army. 

The Cypriot economy was a prosperous one. In 2008 it was classified by the IMF amongst the 32 ''advanced economies'' of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2008/01/weodata/groups.htm#ae |title=IMF Advanced Economies List. World Economic Outlook, Database—WEO Groups and Aggregates Information, April 2008 |publisher=Imf.org |date=2008-04-09 |accessdate=2009-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IMF forecasts that Cyprus will be the only developed economy to enjoy continuous growth rates through the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2010|2009 financial crisis.]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thewest.com.au/default.aspx?MenuId=9&amp;ContentID=138338 ]{{dead link|date=August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Erratic growth rates in the 1990s reflect the economy's vulnerability to swings in tourist arrivals, caused by political instability on the island and fluctuations in economic conditions in [[Western Europe]]. From 1 January 2008, the country entered the [[Eurozone]] and adopted the [[euro]] and monetary policy is dictated by the [[European Central Bank]]. The irrevocable fixed exchange rate of CYP 0.585274 per EUR 1.00 was set.

The economy of Turkish Cypriots is about one-fifth of the Greek Cypriots population and one-third the per capita GDP of the south. Because the Turkish-Cypriot de facto administration is recognized only by [[Turkey]], it has had much difficulty arranging foreign financing, and foreign firms have hesitated to invest there. The economy mainly revolves around the agricultural sector and government service, which together employ about half of the work force. The tourism sector also contributes substantially into the economy. Moreover, the small economy has seen some downfalls because the [[Turkish new lira|Turkish lira]] is [[legal tender]]. To compensate for the economy's weakness, Turkey has been known to provide significant financial aid. In both sectors, water shortage is a growing problem, and several [[desalination plant]]s are planned.

==Economy in the Government-controlled sector==
[[File:Nicosia makariou avenue.jpg|thumb|left|Nicosia, the economic heart of Cyprus]]
Cyprus has an open, free-market, service-based economy with some light [[manufacturing]]. The Cypriots are among the most prosperous people in the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] region. Internationally, Cyprus promotes its geographical location as a &quot;bridge&quot; between West and East, along with its educated [[English language|English-speaking]] population, moderate local costs, good airline connections, and telecommunications.

Throughout the post-Independence period, Cyprus has had a record of successful economic performance, reflected in rapid growth, full employment conditions and external and internal stability. The underdeveloped economy, inherited from Colonial Rule in 1960, has been transformed into a modern economy, with dynamic services, industrial and agricultural sectors and advanced physical and social infrastructure. 

Cyprus is classified among the high-income countries, with a per capita income of CY£9,477 in 2004 . It has a standard of living that is even higher than some other European Union member-states and the performance of the economy compares favourably with that of most other EU countries. Cyprus holds 16th place worldwide in terms of per capita income. The average annual rate of growth in the past five years was about 3.8%, while inflation stood at 2.9% and unemployment at 3.4% over that period.

These achievements appear all the more striking, bearing in mind the severe economic and social dislocation created by the [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus|Turkish invasion]] of 1974 and the continuing occupation of the northern part of the island by [[Turkey]]. The Turkish invasion inflicted a serious blow to the Cyprus economy and in particular to agriculture, [[Tourism in Cyprus|tourism]], mining and quarrying: 70 percent of the island’s rich producing resources were lost, the tourist industry lost 65 percent of its hotels and tourist accommodation, the industrial sector lost 46 percent, and mining and quarrying lost 56 percent of production. The loss of the Port of [[Famagusta]], which handled 83 percent of the general cargo, and the closure of the [[Nicosia]] International Airport, in the [[United Nations Buffer Zone in Cyprus|buffer zone]], were additional blows.
[[File:Spectacular view of Nicosia by night, Cyprus.JPG|thumb|left|Downtown [[Nicosia]] by night]]
The success of Cyprus in the economic sphere is attributed, inter alia, to the adoption of a market oriented economic system, the pursuance of sound macroeconomic policies by the government as well as the existence of a dynamic and flexible entrepreneurship and a highly educated labour force. Moreover, the economy benefited from the close cooperation between the public sector and the social partners.

In the past 20 years, the economy has shifted from agriculture to light manufacturing and services. The service sector, including tourism, contributes 70% to the GDP and employs 62% of the labor force. Industry and construction contribute 24% and employ 25% of labor. Manufactured goods account for approximately 69% of domestic exports. Agriculture is responsible for 6% of GDP and 12% of the labor force. Potatoes and citrus are the principal export crops.

After robust growth rates in the 1980s (average annual growth was 6.1%), economic performance in the 1990s has been mixed: Real GDP growth was 9.7% in 1992, 1.7% in 1993, 6.0% in 1994, 6.0% in 1995, 1.9% in 1996 and 2.3% in 1997. This pattern underlines the economy's vulnerability to swings in tourist arrivals (i.e., to economic and political conditions in Cyprus, [[Western Europe]], and the [[Middle East]]) and the need to restructure the economy. Declining competitiveness in tourism and especially in manufacturing will act as a drag on growth until structural changes are effected. Overvaluation of the Cypriot pound had kept inflation in check.

Trade is vital to the Cypriot economy—the island is not self-sufficient in food and has few natural resources—and the trade deficit continues to grow. Exports rose by 1.3% in 1997, while imports rose by 2.2%, resulting in a trade deficit of $2.1 billion (2.7% higher than the previous year). Cyprus must import fuels, most raw materials, heavy machinery, and transportation equipment. More than 50% of its trade is with the European Union (especially the [[United Kingdom|UK]]); the Middle East receives 20% of exports. EU accession negotiations started on 31 March 1998. In 1991, Cyprus introduced a [[Value Added Tax]] (VAT), which is currently 15% in line with the EU minimum. Cyprus ratified the new world trade agreement ([[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]], GATT) in 1995 and began implementing it fully on 1 January 1996.

On 1 May 2004, Cyprus became a full member of the EU.

Cyprus has the fourth-largest [[Cyprus Merchant Marine|ship registry]] in the world, with 2,758 ships and 25.5 million [[Gross Register Tonnage|gross registered tons]] (GRTs). It is an open registry and includes ships from more than 43 countries, including [[Greece]], [[Germany]], and [[Russia]].

===Export opportunities===
Cyprus has been liberalizing its trade regime by eliminating import quotas and licenses and lowering tariffs on most products as a result of its obligations under the new world trade agreement and its Customs Union agreement with the European Union. As a result, U.S. products are becoming more competitive in Cyprus and prospects for further expansion of bilateral trade ties are excellent.

[[e-Government|Government computerization]] and telecommunications development, two of the priorities of the government's 5-year development plan (1994–1998), provide excellent opportunities for U.S. exports. Sales of computer-assisted design systems, new capital equipment for textile, clothing, footwear production, medical equipment, environmental equipment, and services are also expected to grow. [[United States|U.S.]] pressure resulted in the adoption of a new copyright law in 1994 and a new patent law in 1998.

===Investment climate===

In February 1997, the government revised its policy on foreign direct investment, permitting 100% foreign ownership in certain cases. Regulations on foreign portfolio investment in the Cyprus Stock Exchange also have been liberalized. Additionally, Cyprus passed a modern banking law in July 1997, incorporating all the provisions and directives of the EU for the prudential supervision of credit institutions.

Cyprus has concluded treaties on double taxation with 26 countries, including the U.S., and has removed exchange restrictions on current international transactions. Non-residents and foreign investors may freely repatriate proceeds from investments in Cyprus.

===Offshore sector===
The 1,049 full-fledged offshore companies—which are located in Cyprus but conduct business abroad only—qualify for various tax- and duty-free concessions. Foreign exchange earnings from offshore companies rose to $346 million in 1997. There are about 40 U.S.-owned firms in Cyprus; about half operate exclusively on an offshore basis.

U.S. firms are mainly engaged in the regional marketing of [[computer]]s, computer graphics, [[telecommunications]], [[printing]] equipment, household products, and soft drinks. Since 1994, re-entry visa provisions have been streamlined and 3-year work permits have been introduced for offshore employees.

===Trade between Cyprus and the United States===

The U.S. embassy in [[Nicosia]] sponsors a popular pavilion for American products at the annual Cyprus International State Fair, hosts the Commercial Awards dinner, and organizes other events to promote U.S. products throughout the year. Total U.S. exports to Cyprus were about $700 million in 1997 (compared with $670 million in 1996), making the U.S. Cyprus' number-one supplier of total imports for the third year in a row. Exports include American tobacco and tobacco products, automatic data processing and other machinery, and cereals. Principal U.S. imports from Cyprus consist of clothing, footwear, steel tubes and pipes, dairy products, and various food items.

==Turkish Cypriot economy==
The economic disparity between the two communities is pronounced. Although the Cypriot Turkish army occupied area operates on a free-market basis, the lack of private and governmental investment, shortages of skilled labor and experienced managers, plus inflation and the devaluation of the Turkish lira (which the [[Turkish Cypriots]] use as their currency) continue to plague the economy.

Turkey is, by far, the main trading partner of the Turkish army occupied area, &quot;T.R.N.C.,&quot; supplying 55% of imports and absorbing 48% of exports. In a landmark case, the [[European Court of Justice]] (ECJ) ruled on 5 July 1994, against the British practice of importing produce from Turkish army occupied area based on certificates of origin and phytosanitary certificates granted by &quot;T.R.N.C.&quot; authorities. The ECJ decision stated that only goods bearing certificates of origin from the Government of Cyprus could be recognized for trade by EU member countries. That decision resulted in a considerable decrease of Turkish Cypriot exports to the EU: from $36.4 million (or 66.7% of total Turkish Cypriot exports) in 1993 to $24.7 million in 1996 (or 35% of total exports) in 1996. Even so, the EU continues to be the &quot;T.R.N.C.'s&quot; second-largest trading partner, with a 24.7% share of total imports and 35% share of total exports.

Assistance from Turkey is the mainstay of the Turkish Cypriot economy. Under the latest economic protocol (signed 3 January 1997), Turkey undertakes to provide Turkish Cypriots loans totaling $250 million for the purpose of implementing projects included in the protocol related to public finance, tourism, banking, and privatization. Fluctuation in the [[Turkish lira]], which suffered from [[hyperinflation]] every year until its replacement by the [[New Turkish Lira]] in 2005, exerted downward pressure on the Turkish Cypriot standard of living for many years.

The Turkish Cypriot de facto authorities have instituted a free market in foreign exchange and permit residents to hold foreign-currency denominated bank accounts. This encourages transfers from Turkish Cypriots living abroad.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Because [[Cyprus]] has no working [[railway]] system, various other methods of [[transportation]] are  needed to ensure the proper delivery of any cargo, be it human or freight.  Since [[Cyprus Government Railway|the last railway]] was dismantled in 1952, the only remaining modes of transport are by [[motorway]]s, by sea, and by air.

[[Image:A1 Motorway Cyprus.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Night view between [[Agios Athanasios junction]] and [[Mesa Geitonia junction]] in [[Limassol]]]]

Of the 12,118 km of roads in the areas still controlled by the Republic of Cyprus in 2006, 7,850 km were paved, while 4,268 km were unpaved. In 1996, the Turkish Cypriot area showed a close, but smaller ratio of paved to unpaved with about 1,370 km out of 2,350 km paved and 980 km unpaved. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mcw.gov.cy/mcw/PWD/pwd.nsf/All/0A49EACB1E1CA73FC2257354003B6922?Opendocument Τμήμα Δημοσίων Έργων - Στατιστικά Στοιχεία - Συντήρηση Δρόμων 2006&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; A remnant of British occupation, Cyprus is one of the few EU nations in which vehicles drive on the [[Driving on the left or right|left side of the road]].

===Public buses===
In 2006 extensive plans were announced to improve and expand bus services and restructure public transport throughout Cyprus, with the financial backing of the European Union Development Bank. In 2010 the new revised and expanded bus network got implemented.

==Licensed vehicles==

Road transport is the dominant form of transport on the island. Figures released by the [[International Road Federation]] in 2007 show that Cyprus holds the highest car ownership rate in the world with 742 cars per 1,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Public transport in Cyprus is limited to privately run bus services (except in [[Nicosia]]), taxis, and interurban 'shared' taxi services (locally referred to as ''service taxis''). Thus, private car ownership in the country is the fifth highest per capita in the world. However in 2006 extensive plans were announced to expand and improve bus services and restructure public transport throughout Cyprus, with the financial backing of the [[European Union]] Development Bank

== Ports and harbours ==

The ports of Cyprus are operated and maintained by the [[Cyprus Ports Authority]]. Major [[harbour]]s of the island are ''[[Limassol Port|Limassol]] harbour'', and ''[[Larnaca]] harbour'', which service cargo, passenger, and cruise ships. Limassol is the larger of the two, and handles a large volume of both cargo and cruise vessels. Larnaca is primarily a cargo port but played a big part in the evacuation of foreign nationals from [[Lebanon]] in 2006, and in the subsequent humanitarian aid effort. A smaller cargo dock also exists at [[Vasilikos]], near [[Zygi]] (a small town between Larnaca and Limassol). Smaller vessels and private yachts can dock at Marinas in Cyprus.

== Airports ==
[[Image:LCA_Airport_1.jpg|thumb|right|Larnaca Airport]]
In 1999, Cyprus had 12 airports with paved runways. Of them, seven had runways of lengths between 2,438 and 3,047 metres, one had a length between 1,524 and 2,437 metres, three had lengths between 914 and 1524 metres, and one had a length less than 914 metres.

Of the three airports with unpaved runways, two had lengths less than 914 metres and one had a length between 914 and 1524 metres.

In 1999, Cyprus had six heliports and two international airports: [[Larnaca International Airport]] and [[Paphos International Airport]]. [[Nicosia International Airport]] has been closed since 1974.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Politics of Cyprus}}
'''Cyprus''' is a member of the [[United Nations]]&lt;ref name='S/4469'&gt; {{Cite web|url=http://daccessdds.un.org/doc/RESOLUTION/GEN/NR0/157/44/IMG/NR015744.pdf?OpenElement |title=UN Security Council Resolution 155 (1960) |accessdate=January 29, 2007 |date=August 23, 1960 |format=PDF |publisher=United Nations}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with most of its agencies as well as the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], [[World Bank]], [[International Monetary Fund]] and [[Council of Europe]]. In addition, the country has signed the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT) and the ''Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency Agreement'' (MIGA).

==Non-alignment==
[[File:Cyprus stub.svg|thumb|left]]
[[Cyprus]] has historically followed a non-aligned foreign policy, although it increasingly identifies with the West in its cultural affinities and trade patterns, and maintains close relations with [[Greece]].

The prime originator of Cypriot non-alignment was [[Makarios III]], the first [[Presidents of Cyprus|President]] (1960–1977) of the independent republic of Cyprus. Prior to independence, Makarios - by virtue of his post as [[List of Archbishops of Cyprus|Archbishop of Cyprus]] and head of the [[Cypriot Orthodox Church]] - was the [[Greek Cypriot Ethnarch]], or [[de facto]] leader of the community. A highly influential figure well before independence, he participated in the 1955 [[Bandung Conference]]. After independence, Makarios took part in the 1961 founding meeting of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] in [[Belgrade]].

[[Image:Cyprus representations.png|thumb|right|350px|Cyprus representations abroad{{legend|#008000|resident embassy}} {{legend|#00ff00|non-resident embassy}} {{legend|#0080ff|diplomatic relations only, but no mission}}&lt;br&gt;{{legend|#ff0000|states that don't recognise the [[Republic of Cyprus]]}}]]

Reasons for this neutrality may lie in the extreme pressures exerted on the infant Republic by its larger neighbours, Turkey and Greece. [[Cyprus dispute|Intercommunal rivalries]] and movements for [[enosis|union with Greece]] or partial union with Turkey may have persuaded Makarios to steer clear of close affiliation with either side. In any case Cyprus became a high-profile member of the Non-Aligned Movement and retained its membership until its entry into the [[European Union]] in 2004. At the non-governmental level, Cyprus has also been a member of the popular extension of the Non-Aligned Movement, the [[Afro-Asian Peoples' Solidarity Organisation]] hosting several high-level meetings.

Immediately after the 1974 Greek-sponsored [[coup d'état]] and the [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus|Turkish invasion]], Makarios secured international recognition of his administration as the legitimate government of the whole island. This was disputed only by [[Turkey]], which currently recognises only the [[Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus]], established in 1983.

Since the 1974 crisis, the chief aim of the foreign policy of the Republic of Cyprus has been to secure the withdrawal of Turkish forces and the reunification of the island under the most favourable constitutional and territorial settlement possible. This campaign has been pursued primarily through international forums such as the [[United Nations]] and the [[Non-Aligned Movement]], and in recent years through the European Union.

Cyprus is expanding relations with [[Russia]], [[Israel]], and [[Syria]], from which it purchases most of its oil. In the past it had some difficulty with both [[Israel]] and [[Egypt]].

[[File:Demetris Christofias with Obamas.jpg|thumb|Cyprus president [[Dimitris Christofias]] and Cyprus first lady with U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] and [[Michelle Obama]]]]

==Israel==
Cyprus has frequently expressed concern over Israel's close defense relationship with Turkey. In the case of Israel, Cyprus has occasionally outwardly backed the [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]]s in the [[Arab-Israeli conflict]], to the annoyance of some in the Israeli government. Cyprus, like over 100 other countries, officially recognizes Palestine as a de facto state.
The island is also host to a number of Palestinian and Lebanese refugees.

Relations between the two countries continued to suffer when Cypriot first lady Antroulla Vasiliou, the wife of President [[George Vasiliou]], was declared [[Persona Non Grata]] in Israel when a delegation she was leading attempted to meet with [[Yasser Arafat]], who was under house arrest.

Controversy and public outcry arose in the early 2000s, when members of the Cypriot branch of the [[Greek Orthodox Church]] were accused of selling church-owned land in the [[West Bank]] to Israeli developers, putting Cypriot commitment to the Palestinian cause at question.
The expulsion of two alleged Israeli spies from the island in 1998 also caused tension between the two governments.

The two countries now appear to be on improving terms, there has been coopertation on numerous areas but mostly on agriculture, military and tourism. The Cypriot government has also been reported to be making deals with both Israel and Egypt in exploring for oil off the southern Cyprus coast.

Israeli foreign minister [[Avigdor Lieberman]] visited Cyprus at the invitation of his Cypriot counterpart when Netanyahu was in Washington for the direct talks with the Palestinian leader. Lieberman and Cyprus foreign minister Kyprianou have met several times this year in an effort to strengthen relations between their countries.

==Turkey==
[[Turkey]] flatly refuses to recognize the government of the Republic of Cyprus, stating that the Republic - as established by the Constitution of 1960 - ceased to exist when the intercommunal violence that commenced in December 1963 ended Turkish Cypriot participation in the Cypriot government. The attempted coup in July 1974 - engineered by Greece - was responded to by Turkey by a full military invasion, which resulted in the northern third of the island being occupied by Turkish military forces. This portion of Cyprus unilaterally declared independence in November 1983 as the [[Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus]] (TRNC), which Turkey recognizes. Turkey refers to the Republic of Cyprus government as &quot;The Greek Cypriot Administration of South Cyprus&quot;.

Cyprus takes the view that the TRNC government is a puppet administration, and thus prefers to negotiate with Turkey over the resolution of the Cyprus Problem. Turkey insists that the TRNC government is the institution that the RoC government must refer to in negotiations.

Cyprus' accession to the European Union has had a negative impact on Turkey in regards to its own accession negotiations. The refusal of Turkey to allow Cypriot-flagged ships to access Turkish ports has resulted in a partial suspension of its accession negotiations. However Cyprus is in favor of Turkey's Accession to the EU with the hope it will facilitate a viable and just solution of the Cyprus Problem.&lt;ref&gt;Stephanos Constantinides and Jean Catsiapis Cyprus, Greece, Turkey. From The Summit of Helsinki to The Summit of Nice, ''Etudes helléniques / Hellenic Studies'', 9 (2), Spring 2001. ISSN 0824-8621&lt;/ref&gt;

==Europe==
[[File:Birger Jarlsgatan 37.JPG|thumb|Cyprus embassy in [[Stockholm]]]]
[[File:Povarskaya 9 by I.S.Kuznetsov1910d.jpg|thumb|left|Cyprus embassy in [[Moscow]]]]
Cyprus' 1990 application for full [[European Union|EU]] membership caused a storm in the Turkish Cypriot community, which argued that the move required their consent. Following the December 1997 EU Summit decisions on [[EU enlargement]], accession negotiations began March 31, 1998. Cyprus joined the European Union on May 1, 2004. To fulfil its commitment as a member of the European Union, Cyprus withdrew from the Non-Aligned Movement on accession, retaining observer status.

Several Cypriot villages remain enclaved in the areas, and there have been numerous arrests of anti-British demonstrators over the past few years. These activists assert that the UK should not continue to hold territory in another EU state.

Canadian bilateral political relations with Cyprus stemmed initially from Cypriot Commonwealth membership at independence in 1960 (that had followed a guerrilla struggle with Britain). These relations quickly expanded in 1964 when [[Canada]] became a major troop contributor to [[UNFICYP]]. The participation lasted for the next 29 years, during which 50,000 Canadian soldiers served and 28 were killed. In large measure Canadian relations with Cyprus continue to revolve around support for the ongoing efforts of the [[UN]], [[G8]] and others to resolve the Island's divided status. Contacts with Cyprus on other issues also take place in international organizations such as the UN, the [[OSCE]] and the [[Commonwealth of Nations]].

==Disputes - international==
[[File:Rice speaks with troops after landing in Larnaca July 24 2006.jpg|thumb|[[Condoleezza Rice]] by US ambassadors in [[Larnaca International Airport]], Cyprus]]
The 1974 invasion of the Turkish army divided the [[island nation]] into two. The internationally recognised Republic of Cyprus currently has effective control in the south of the island (59% of the island's land area) while its area not under its effective control makes up 37% of the island. Turkey utilising the territory occupied during the [[Turkish Invasion of Cyprus|invasion]] recognizes a declared [[separatism|separatist]]&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Hitchens, Uncorking the Genie: The Cyprus Question and Turkey's Military Rule MERIP Reports, No. 122, Turkey under Military Rule (Mar. - Apr., 1984), pp. 25-27, doi:10.2307/3011799&lt;/ref&gt; [[Declaration of Independence of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus|UDI]] of Turkish Cypriots in 1983, contrary to multiple United Nations Security Council Resolutions. The two territories of the Republic are separated by a [[United Nations Buffer Zone in Cyprus|United Nations Buffer Zone]] (4% of the island); there are two [[Sovereign Base Areas|UK sovereign base areas]] mostly within the Greek Cypriot portion of the island.

==Illicit drugs==
Cyprus is a minor transit point for [[heroin]] and [[hashish]] via air routes and container traffic to [[Europe]], especially from [[Lebanon]] and [[Turkey]]; some [[cocaine]] transits as well. The island has also been criticised for supposedly lax arms control legislation.

The '''Cretaceous''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|k|r|ɪ|ˈ|t|eɪ|ʃ|ə|s}}), derived from the [[Latin language|Latin]] &quot;creta&quot; (chalk), usually abbreviated '''K''' for its [[German language|German]] translation ''Kreide'' (chalk), is a [[geologic period|geologic period and system]] from circa {{ma|cretaceous|{{period start error|cretaceous}}}} to {{Ma|paleocene|{{period end error|Cretaceous}}}} million years ([[Megaannum#SI_prefix_multipliers|Ma]]) ago. In the [[geologic timescale]], the Cretaceous follows the [[Jurassic]] Period and is followed by the [[Paleogene]] Period of the [[Cenozoic]] Era. It is the youngest period of the [[Mesozoic]] [[Era]], and at 80 million years long, the longest period of the [[Phanerozoic]] [[Eon]]. The end of the Cretaceous defines the boundary between the Mesozoic and [[Cenozoic]] [[era (geology)|eras]]. In many languages this period is known as &quot;chalk period&quot;.

The Cretaceous was a period with a relatively warm [[climate]] and high [[Sea level#Sea level and dry land|eustatic sea level]]. The oceans and seas were populated with now [[extinct]] [[marine reptile]]s, [[ammonites]] and [[rudists]]; and the land by [[dinosaurs]]. At the same time, new groups of [[mammal]]s and [[birds]] as well as [[flowering plants]] appeared. The Cretaceous ended with one of the largest [[mass extinction]]s in [[Earth history]], the [[Cretaceous–Tertiary extinction event|K-T extinction]], when many species, including non-avian dinosaurs, [[pterosaur]]s, and large marine reptiles, disappeared.
[[File:Conguillio llaima.jpg|260px|thumb|Although the first representatives of leafy trees and true grasses emerged in the Cretaceous, the flora was still dominated by conifers like [[Auracaria]] (Here: Modern ''Araucaria araucana'' in Chile).]]

==The Cretaceous world==
===Paleogeography===
During the Cretaceous, the late-[[Paleozoic]]-to-early-Mesozoic [[supercontinent]] of [[Pangaea]] completed its [[Plate tectonics|tectonic]] breakup into present day [[continent]]s, although their positions were substantially different at the time. As the [[Atlantic Ocean]] widened, the convergent-margin [[orogeny|orogenies]] that had begun during the [[Jurassic]] continued in the [[American cordillera|North American Cordillera]], as the [[Nevadan orogeny]] was followed by the [[Sevier orogeny|Sevier]] and [[Laramide orogeny|Laramide orogenies]].

[[File:US cretaceous general.png|thumb|275px|Geography of the US in the Late Cretaceous Period]]
Though [[Gondwana]] was still intact in the beginning of the Cretaceous, it broke up as [[South America]], [[Antarctica]] and [[Australia]] rifted away from [[Africa]] (though [[India]] and [[Madagascar]] remained attached to each other); thus, the South Atlantic and [[Indian Ocean]]s were newly formed. Such active rifting lifted great undersea mountain chains along the welts, raising [[Sea level#Sea level and dry land|eustatic sea levels]] worldwide. To the north of Africa the [[Tethys Sea]] continued to narrow. Broad shallow seas advanced across central [[North America]] (the [[Western Interior Seaway]]) and Europe, then receded late in the period, leaving thick marine deposits sandwiched between [[coal]] beds. At the peak of the Cretaceous [[transgression (geology)|transgression]], one-third of Earth's present land area was submerged.&lt;ref&gt;Dougal Dixon et al., ''Atlas of Life on Earth'', (New York: Barnes &amp; Noble Books, 2001), p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cretaceous is justly famous for its [[chalk]]; indeed, more chalk formed in the Cretaceous than in any other period in the [[Phanerozoic]].&lt;ref&gt;Stanley, Steven M. ''Earth System History.'' New York: W.H. Freeman and Company, 1999. ISBN 0-7167-2882-6 p. 280&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mid-ocean ridge]] activity—or rather, the circulation of seawater through the enlarged ridges—enriched the oceans in calcium; this made the oceans more saturated, as well as increased the bioavailability of the element for [[Coccolithophores|calcareous nanoplankton]].&lt;ref&gt;Stanley, pp. 279&amp;ndash;81&lt;/ref&gt; These widespread [[carbonate]]s and other [[sedimentary rock|sedimentary deposits]] make the Cretaceous rock record especially fine. Famous [[Geologic formation|formations]] from North America include the rich marine fossils of [[Kansas]]'s [[Smoky Hill Chalk]] Member and the terrestrial fauna of the late Cretaceous [[Hell Creek Formation]]. Other important Cretaceous exposures occur in [[Europe]] (e.g., the [[Weald]]) and [[China]] (the [[Yixian Formation]]). In the area that is now India, massive lava beds called the [[Deccan Traps]] were erupted in the very late Cretaceous and early Paleocene.

===Climate===
The [[Berriasian]] epoch showed a cooling trend that had been seen in the last epoch of the Jurassic. There is evidence that snowfalls were common in the higher latitudes and the tropics became wetter than during the Triassic and Jurassic.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Berriasian Age&quot;&gt;[http://www.palaeos.com/Mesozoic/Cretaceous/Berriasian.html The Berriasian Age]&lt;/ref&gt; Glaciation was however restricted to alpine [[glacier]]s on some high-[[latitude]] mountains, though seasonal snow may have existed farther south. Rafting by ice of stones into marine environments occurred during much of the Cretaceous but evidence of deposition directly from glaciers is limited to the Early Cretaceous of the Eromanga Basin in southern Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Alley, N.F. and Frakes, L.A. 2003. &quot;First known Cretaceous glaciation: Livingston Tillite, South Australia&quot;. ''Australian Journal of Earth Science'' '''50''':134–150.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frakes, L.A. and Francis, J. E. 1988. &quot;A guide to Phanerozoic cold climates from high latitude ice rafting in the Cretaceous&quot;. ''Nature'' '''333''':547–549.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the end of the Berriasian, however, temperatures increased again, and these conditions were almost constant until the end of the period.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Berriasian Age&quot;/&gt; This trend was due to intense [[volcanic activity]] which produced large quantities of [[carbon dioxide]]. The production of large quantities of magma, variously attributed to [[mantle plume]]s or to extensional tectonics,&lt;ref name=Foulger&gt;{{cite book |title=Plates vs. Plumes: A Geological Controversy |author=Foulger, G.R. |url=http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1405161485.html |year=2010 |isbn=978-1-4051-6148-0 |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell}}&lt;/ref&gt; further pushed sea levels up, so that large areas of the continental crust were covered with shallow seas. The [[Tethys Sea]] connecting the tropical oceans east to west also helped in warming the global climate. Warm-adapted [[plant fossil]]s are known from localities as far north as [[Alaska]] and [[Greenland]], while [[dinosaur]] fossils have been found within 15 degrees of the Cretaceous [[south pole]].&lt;ref&gt;Stanley, pp. 480&amp;ndash;2&lt;/ref&gt;

A very gentle [[temperature gradient]] from the [[equator]] to the poles meant weaker global winds, contributing to less [[upwelling]] and more stagnant [[ocean]]s than today. This is evidenced by widespread black [[shale]] deposition and frequent [[anoxic event]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley, pp. 481&amp;ndash;2&lt;/ref&gt; Sediment cores show that tropical [[sea surface temperature]]s may have briefly been as warm as 42 °C (107 °F), 17 °C (31 °F) warmer than at present, and that they averaged around 37 °C (99 °F). Meanwhile deep ocean temperatures were as much as 15 to 20 °C (27 to 36 °F) higher than today's.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.physorg.com/news10978.html|&quot;Warmer than a Hot Tub: Atlantic Ocean Temperatures Much Higher in the Past&quot;] [[PhysOrg.com]].

==Geology==
{{Cretaceous graphical timeline}}
===Research history===
The Cretaceous as a separate period was first defined by a Belgian geologist [[Jean Baptiste Julien d'Omalius d'Halloy|Jean d'Omalius d'Halloy]] in 1822, using [[stratum|strata]] in the [[Paris Basin (geology)|Paris Basin]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]]|publisher=Sovetskaya Enciklopediya|edition=3rd|pages=vol. 16, p. 50|year=1974|location=Moscow|language=Russian|nopp=true}}&lt;/ref&gt; and named for the extensive beds of [[chalk]] ([[calcium carbonate]] deposited by the shells of marine [[invertebrate]]s, principally [[coccoliths]]), found in the upper Cretaceous of western [[Europe]]. The name Cretaceous was derived from [[Latin]] ''creta'', meaning ''chalk''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Glossary of Geology|publisher=American Geological Institute|edition=3rd|pages= 165|year=1972|location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name of the island [[Crete]] has the same origin.

===Stratigraphic subdivisions===
The Cretaceous is divided into [[Early Cretaceous|Early]] and [[Late Cretaceous]] [[epoch (geology)|epochs]] or Lower and Upper Cretaceous [[series (stratigraphy)|series]]. In older literature the Cretaceous is sometimes divided into three series: [[Neocomian]] (lower/early), Gallic (middle) and [[Senonian]] (upper/late). A subdivision in eleven [[stage (stratigraphy)|stages]], all origining from European stratigraphy, is now used worldwide. In many parts of the world, alternative local subdivisions are still in use.

As with other older geologic periods, the rock beds of the Cretaceous are well identified but the exact ages of the system's top and base are uncertain by a few million years. No great [[extinction]] or burst of diversity separates the Cretaceous from the Jurassic. However, the top of the system is sharply defined, being placed at an [[iridium]]-rich layer found worldwide that is believed to be associated with the [[Chicxulub Crater|Chicxulub impact crater]] in [[Yucatan]] and the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. This layer has been tightly dated at 65.5 Ma.&lt;ref&gt;The official geologic timescale of the ICS (in 2008) gives 65.5 Ma as upper boundary of the Cretaceous, new callibrations by Kuiper ''et al.'' (2008) yield 65.9 Ma&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rock formations===
[[Image:MosasaurusHoffmann.jpg|thumb|left|Drawing of fossil jaws of ''[[Mosasaurus|Mosasaurus hoffmanni]]'', from the [[Maastrichtian]] of [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Dutch Limburg]], by Dutch geologist [[Pieter Harting]] (1866).]]
The high eustatic sea level and warm climate of the Cretaceous meant a large area of the continents was covered by warm shallow seas. The Cretaceous was named for the extensive chalk deposits of this age in Europe, but in many parts of the world, the Cretaceous system consists for a major part of [[Sediment#Shores and shallow seas|marine]] [[limestone]], a rock type that is formed under warm, shallow marine circumstances. Due to the high sea level there was extensive accommodation space for [[sedimentation]] so that thick deposits could form. Because of the relatively young age and great thickness of the system, Cretaceous rocks crop out in many areas worldwide.

[[Chalk]] is a rock type characteristic for (but not restricted to) the Cretaceous. It consists of [[coccolith]]s, microscopically small [[calcite]] skeletons of [[coccolithophore]]s, a type of [[algae]] that prospered in the Cretaceous seas.

In northwestern Europe, chalk deposits from the Upper Cretaceous are characteristic for the [[Chalk Group]], which forms the [[white cliffs of Dover]] on the south coast of [[England]] and similar cliffs on the [[France|French]] [[Normandy|Normandian]] coast. The [[group (stratigraphy)|group]] is found in England, northern France, the [[low countries]], northern [[Germany]], [[Denmark]] and in the subsurface of the southern part of the [[North Sea]]. Chalk is not easily [[Consolidation (soil)|consolidated]] and the Chalk Group still consists of loose sediments in many places. The group also has other [[limestone]]s and [[arenite]]s. Among the fossils it contains are [[sea urchin]]s, [[belemnite]]s, [[ammonites]] and sea reptiles such as ''[[Mosasaurus]]''.

In southern Europe, the Cretaceous is usually a marine system consisting of [[Competence (geology)|competent]] limestone beds or incompetent [[marl]]s. Because the [[Alpine orogeny|Alpine mountain chains]] did not yet exist in the Cretaceous, these deposits formed on the southern edge of the European [[continental shelf]], at the margin of the [[Tethys Ocean]].

Stagnation of deep sea currents in middle Cretaceous times caused anoxic conditions in the sea water. In many places around the world, dark anoxic [[shale]]s were formed during this interval.&lt;ref&gt;See Stanley (1999), pp. 481&amp;ndash;482&lt;/ref&gt; These shales are an important [[source rock]] for oil and gas, for example in the subsurface of the North Sea.

==Life==
===Plants===
Flowering plants ([[angiosperms]]) spread during this period, although they did not become predominant until the [[Campanian]] stage near the end of the epoch. Their evolution was aided by the appearance of [[bee]]s; in fact angiosperms and insects are a good example of [[coevolution]]. The first representatives of many leafy trees, including [[ficus|fig]]s, [[Platanus|planes]] and [[magnolia]]s, appeared in the Cretaceous. At the same time, some earlier Mesozoic [[gymnosperm]]s like [[Conifer]]s continued to thrive; pehuéns (Monkey Puzzle trees, ''[[Araucaria]]'') and other [[conifer]]s being notably plentiful and widespread. Some fern orders such as Gleicheniales&lt;ref&gt;C.Michael Hogan. 2010. [http://www.eoearth.org/article/Fern ''Fern''. Encyclopedia of Earth. National council for Science and the Environment]. Washington, DC&lt;/ref&gt; appeared as early in the fossil record as the Cretaceous, and achieved an early broad distribution. Gymnosperm taxa like [[Bennettitales]] died out before the end of the period. {{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}

===Terrestrial fauna===

Image:Coloborhynchus piscator jconway.jpg|A [[pterosaur]], ''[[Anhanguera (pterosaur)|Anhanguera piscator]]''
&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
On land, [[mammal]]s were a small and still relatively minor component of the [[Fauna (animals)|fauna]]. Early [[marsupial]] mammals evolved in the Early Cretaceous, with true [[placentals]] emerging in the Late Cretaceous period. The fauna was dominated by [[archosaur]]ian [[reptile]]s, especially [[dinosaur]]s, which were at their most diverse stage. [[Pterosaur]]s were common in the early and middle Cretaceous, but as the Cretaceous proceeded they faced growing competition from the [[adaptive radiation]] of [[bird]]s, and by the end of the period only two highly specialized [[Family (biology)|families]] remained.

The [[Liaoning]] [[lagerstätte]] ([[Chaomidianzi formation]]) in China provides a glimpse of life in the Early Cretaceous, where preserved remains of numerous types of small dinosaurs, birds, and mammals have been found. The [[coelurosaur]] dinosaurs found there represent types of the group [[Maniraptor]]a, which is transitional between dinosaurs and birds, and are notable for the presence of hair-like [[feather]]s.

During the Cretaceous, [[insect]]s began to diversify, and the oldest known [[ant]]s, [[termite]]s and some [[lepidoptera]]ns, akin to [[butterflies]] and [[moths]], appeared. [[Aphid]]s, [[grasshopper]]s, and [[gall wasp]]s appeared.&lt;ref name=&quot;UCMP&quot; /&gt;

===Marine fauna===

&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
In the seas, [[batoidea|rays]], modern [[shark]]s and [[teleost]]s became common.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.talkorigins.org/origins/geo_timeline.html&lt;/ref&gt; Marine reptiles included [[ichthyosaur]]s in the early and middle of the Cretaceous, becoming extinct during the late Cretaceous, [[plesiosaur]]s throughout the entire period, and [[mosasaur]]s appearing in the Late Cretaceous.

''[[Baculites]]'', an [[ammonite]] genus with a straight shell, flourished in the seas along with reef-building [[rudist]] clams. The [[Hesperornithiformes]] were flightless, marine diving birds that swam like [[grebe]]s. Globotruncanid [[Foraminifera]] and [[echinoderms]] such as sea urchins and [[Asteroidea|starfish (sea stars)]] thrived. The first radiation of the [[diatom]]s (generally [[silicon dioxide|siliceous]], rather than [[calcareous]]) in the oceans occurred during the Cretaceous; freshwater diatoms did not appear until the [[Miocene]].&lt;ref name=&quot;UCMP&quot;&gt;http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/mesozoic/cretaceous/cretlife.html&lt;/ref&gt; The Cretaceous was also an important interval in the evolution of [[bioerosion]], the production of borings and scrapings in rocks, [[hardgrounds]] and shells (Taylor and Wilson, 2003).

===Extinction===
[[Image:Impact event.jpg|thumb|The impact of a [[meteorite]] or [[comet]] is today widely accepted as the main reason for the [[Cretaceous-Tertiary extinction event]].]]
{{main|Cretaceous–Tertiary extinction event}}
There was a progressive decline in [[biodiversity]] during the Maastrichtian stage of the Cretaceous Period prior to the suggested [[ecological crisis]] induced by events at the [[K–T boundary]]. Furthermore, biodiversity required a substantial amount of time to recover from the K-T event, despite the probable existence of an abundance of vacant [[ecological niche]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacLeod&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author=MacLeod, N, Rawson, PF, Forey, PL, Banner, FT, Boudagher-Fadel, MK, Bown, PR, Burnett, JA, Chambers, P, Culver, S, Evans, SE, Jeffery, C, Kaminski, MA, Lord, AR, Milner, AC, Milner, AR, Morris, N, Owen, E, Rosen, BR, Smith, AB, Taylor, PD, Urquhart, E &amp; Young, JR|title=The Cretaceous–Tertiary biotic transition|year=1997|journal=Journal of the Geological Society|volume=154|issue=2|pages=265–292|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3721/is_199703/ai_n8738406/print|doi=10.1144/gsjgs.154.2.0265}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the severity of this boundary event, there was significant variability in the rate of extinction between and within different [[clades]]. Species which depended on [[photosynthesis]] declined or became extinct because of the reduction in [[solar energy]] reaching the Earth's surface due to atmospheric particles blocking the sunlight. As is the case today, photosynthesizing organisms, such as [[phytoplankton]] and land [[plant]]s, formed the primary part of the [[food chain]] in the late Cretaceous. Evidence suggests that [[Herbivores|herbivorous]] animals, which depended on plants and plankton as their food, died out as their food sources became scarce; consequently, top [[predator]]s such as ''[[Tyrannosaurus|Tyrannosaurus rex]]'' also perished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Wilf, P &amp; Johnson KR|title=Land plant extinction at the end of the Cretaceous: a quantitative analysis of the North Dakota megafloral record|journal=Paleobiology|year=2004|volume=30|issue=3|pages=347–368|doi = 10.1666/0094-8373(2004)030&lt;0347:LPEATE&gt;2.0.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Coccolithophorids]] and [[mollusc]]s, including [[ammonite]]s, [[rudist]]s, freshwater [[snail]]s and [[mussel]]s, as well as organisms whose [[food chain]] included these shell builders, became extinct or suffered heavy losses. For example, it is thought that ammonites were the principal food of [[mosasaur]]s, a group of giant marine reptiles that became extinct at the boundary.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kauffman&quot;&gt;{{cite journal| last =Kauffman| first =E| authorlink =| coauthors =| title =Mosasaur Predation on Upper Cretaceous Nautiloids and Ammonites from the United States Pacific Coast | journal =PALAIOS| volume =19| issue =1| pages =96–100| publisher =Society for Sedimentary Geology| year =2004| url=http://palaios.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/reprint/19/1/96 | doi = 10.1669/0883-1351(2004)019&lt;0096:MPOUCN&gt;2.0.CO;2|accessdate=2007-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Omnivores]], [[insectivores]] and [[carrion]]-eaters survived the extinction event, perhaps because of the increased availability of their food sources. At the end of the Cretaceous there seem to have been no purely herbivorous or [[carnivore|carnivorous]] [[mammal]]s. Mammals and birds which survived the extinction fed on [[insect]]s, [[larva]]e, [[worm]]s, and snails, which in turn fed on dead plant and animal matter. Scientists theorise that these organisms survived the collapse of plant-based food chains because they fed on [[Detritus (biology)|detritus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;SheehanHansen&quot;&gt;{{cite journal| author=Shehan, P &amp; Hansen, TA | title =Detritus feeding as a buffer to extinction at the end of the Cretaceous| journal =Geology| volume =14| issue =10| pages =868–870| year =1986| url =http://geology.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/content/abstract/14/10/868| doi =10.1130/0091-7613(1986)14&lt;868:DFAABT&gt;2.0.CO;2| id =| accessdate =2007-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MacLeod&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Faunal evidence for reduced productivity and uncoordinated recovery in Southern Hemisphere Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary sections|author=Aberhan, M, Weidemeyer, S, Kieesling, W, Scasso, RA, &amp; Medina, FA|year=2007|journal=Geology|volume=35|issue=3|pages=227–230|doi=10.1130/G23197A.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[stream]] [[Biocoenosis|communities]], few groups of animals became extinct. Stream communities rely less on food from living plants and more on detritus that washes in from land. This particular ecological niche buffered them from extinction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Major extinctions of land-dwelling vertebrates at the Cretaceous–Tertiary boundary, eastern Montana|author=Sheehan, PM &amp; Fastovsky, DE|year=1992|journal=Geology|volume=20|issue=6| pages=556–560|url=http://www.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/georef/1992034409|accessdate=2007-06-22|doi=10.1130/0091-7613(1992)020&lt;0556:MEOLDV&gt;2.3.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar, but more complex patterns have been found in the oceans. Extinction was more severe among animals living in the [[Pelagic zone|water column]], than among animals living on or in the sea floor. Animals in the water column are almost entirely dependent on [[primary production]] from living phytoplankton, while animals living on or in the [[ocean floor]] feed on detritus or can switch to detritus feeding.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacLeod&quot;/&gt;

The largest air-breathing survivors of the event, [[crocodilian]]s and [[Choristodera|champsosaurs]], were semi-aquatic and had access to detritus. Modern crocodilians can live as scavengers and can survive for months without food and go into hibernation when conditions are unfavourable, and their young are small, grow slowly, and feed largely on invertebrates and dead organisms or fragments of organisms for their first few years. These characteristics have been linked to crocodilian survival at the end of the Cretaceous.&lt;ref name=&quot;SheehanHansen&quot;/&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; CJD is at times called a human form of [[mad cow disease]], given the fact that [[bovine spongiform encephalopathy]] is believed to be the cause of variant Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease in humans.&lt;ref name=&quot;British Medical Journal&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title = Bovine spongiform encephalopathy and variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease |author=Paul Brown |url = http://www.bmj.com/content/322/7290/841.full |publisher = [[BMJ]] |date = 2001-07-04 |accessdate = 2011-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; In CJD, the brain tissue develops holes and takes on a sponge-like texture. This is due to a type of infectious protein called a [[prion]]. Prions are [[Protein folding|misfolded]] proteins which replicate by converting their properly folded counterparts.

==Signs and symptoms==
&lt;!--
[[Image:http://pathology.mc.duke.edu/neuropath/CNSlecture2/cjd.jpg]] The spongiform look of the cortex cross-section is characteristic of CJD. --&gt;
The first [[symptom]] of CJD is rapidly progressive [[dementia]], leading to [[memory]] loss, [[Personality psychology|personality]] changes and [[hallucinations]]. This is accompanied by physical problems such as [[Speech communication|speech]] impairment, jerky movements ([[myoclonus]]), balance and coordination dysfunction ([[ataxia]]), changes in [[gait (human)|gait]], rigid [[Human position|posture]], and [[seizures]]. The duration of the disease varies greatly, but sporadic (non-inherited) CJD can be fatal within months or even weeks (Johnson, 1998). In some people, the symptoms can continue for years. In most patients, these symptoms are followed by involuntary movements and the appearance of an atypical diagnostic [[electroencephalogram]] tracing. Most victims die 6 months after initial symptoms appear, often of pneumonia due to impaired coughing reflexes. About 15% of patients survive 2 or more years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gambetti&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Gambetti|first=Pierluigi|title=Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD)|url=http://www.merckmanuals.com/home/sec06/ch090/ch090b.html|publisher=The Merck Manuals: Online Medical Library|accessdate=4/6/11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The symptoms of CJD are caused by the progressive [[cell death|death]] of the brain's [[neuron|nerve cells]], which is associated with the build-up of abnormal [[prion]] proteins forming [[amyloids]]. When brain tissue from a CJD patient is examined under a [[microscope]], many tiny holes can be seen where whole areas of nerve cells have died. The word &quot;spongiform&quot; in &quot;[[transmissible spongiform encephalopathies]]&quot; refers to the sponge-like appearance of the brain tissue.

==Cause==
Transmissible spongiform encephalopathy diseases are caused by [[prion]]s. The diseases are thus sometimes called ''prion diseases''. Other prion diseases include [[Gerstmann–Sträussler–Scheinker syndrome]] (GSS), [[fatal familial insomnia]] (FFI) and [[kuru (disease)|kuru]] in humans, as well as [[bovine spongiform encephalopathy]] (BSE, commonly known as mad cow disease) in cattle, [[chronic wasting disease]] (CWD) in elk and deer, and [[scrapie]] in sheep. [[Alpers' syndrome]] in infants is also thought to be a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy caused by a prion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt;

The prion that is believed to cause Creutzfeldt&amp;ndash;Jakob exhibits at least two stable [[chemical conformation|conformations]]. One, the native state, is water-soluble and present in healthy cells. {{As of|2007}}, its biological function is presumably in transmembrane transport or signaling. The other conformational state is relatively water-insoluble and readily forms protein aggregates.

People can also acquire CJD genetically through a mutation of the gene that codes for the prion protein (PRNP).
This occurs in only 5–10% of all CJD cases.

The CJD prion is dangerous because it promotes [[Protein folding|refolding]] of native proteins into the diseased state{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}. The number of misfolded protein molecules will [[exponential growth|increase exponentially]] and the process leads to a large quantity of insoluble protein in affected [[cell (biology)|cells]]. This mass of misfolded proteins disrupts cell function and causes cell death. Mutations in the gene for the prion protein can cause a misfolding of the dominantly alpha helical regions into beta pleated sheets. This change in conformation disables the ability of the protein to undergo digestion. Once the prion is transmitted, the defective proteins invade the brain and are produced in a self-sustaining [[feedback loop]].

[[Stanley B. Prusiner]] of the [http://prusinerlab.ucsf.edu/index.php University of California, San Francisco (UCSF)] was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine]] in 1997 for his discovery of prions. For more than a decade, [[Yale University]] [[neuropathologist]] [[Laura Manuelidis]] has been challenging this explanation for the disease. In January 2007, she and her colleagues published an article in the ''[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Science]]'' and reported that they have found a [[virus]]-like particle (but without finding [[nucleic acid]]s so far) in less than 10% of the cells a scrapie-infected cell line and in a mouse cell line infected by a human CJD agent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Manuelidis2007&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transmission===
The defective protein can be transmitted by contaminated harvested human brain products, Immunoglobulins ([[IVIG]]), [[cornea]]l grafts, dural grafts or [[electrode]] implants (acquired or [[Iatrogenesis|iatrogenic]] form: iCJD); it can be inherited (hereditary or familial form: fCJD); or it may appear for the first time in the patient (sporadic form: sCJD). In the hereditary form, a [[mutation]] occurs in the [[gene]] for PrP, [[PRNP]]. Ten to 15 percent of CJD cases are inherited. (CDC)

The disease has also been shown to result from use of [[Human Growth Hormone]] obtained from the [[pituitary gland]]s of persons who died from Creutzfeldt&amp;ndash;Jakob Disease,&lt;ref name=&quot;titleHGH Linked to Brain Eater&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the known incidence of this cause is (as of April 2004) quite small. The risk of infection via cadaveric HGH in the US ceased when the medication was withdrawn in 1985.

It is thought that humans can contract the disease by consuming material from animals infected with the bovine form of the disease. The only suspected cases to arise thus far have been vCJD, although there are fears—based on animal studies—that consuming beef or beef products containing prion particles can also cause the development of classic CJD. When BSE material infects humans, the resulting disease is known as (new) variant CJD (nvCJD).&lt;ref name=&quot;nwanebuafrican1&quot;/&gt;

[[Cannibalism]] has also been implicated as a transmission mechanism for abnormal prions, causing the disease known as kuru, once found primarily among women and children of the [[Fore Tribe|Fore tribe]] in [[Papua New Guinea]]. While the men of the tribe ate the body of the deceased and rarely contracted the disease, the women and children, who ate the less desirable body parts, including the brain, were 8 times more likely than men to contract kuru from infected tissue.

Prions, the [[infectious agent]] of CJD, may not be inactivated by means of routine [[surgical instrument]] [[Autoclave|sterilization]] procedures. The [[World Health Organization]] and the US [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] recommend that instrumentation used in such cases be immediately destroyed after use; short of destruction, it is recommended that heat and chemical decontamination be used in combination to process instruments that come in contact with high-infectivity tissues. No cases of iatrogenic transmission of CJD have been reported subsequent to the adoption of current sterilization procedures, or since 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title =Questions and Answers: Creutzfeldt–Jakob Disease Infection-Control Practices|work =Infection Control Practices/CJD (Creutzfeldt–Jakob Disease, Classic)|publisher =Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|date =January 4, 2007|url = http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/cjd/qa_cjd_infection_control.htm#sterilization|accessdate = 2007-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title =WHO Infection Control Guidelines for Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies|publisher =World Health Organization: Communicable Disease Surveillance and Control|date =26 March 1999|url =http://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/bse/WHO_CDS_CSR_APH_2000_3/en/|accessdate = 2007-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===Blood donor restrictions===
In 2004 a new report published in the ''[[The Lancet|Lancet]]'' medical journal showed that vCJD can be transmitted by [[blood transfusion]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15302196&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Peden AH, Head MW, Ritchie DL, Bell JE, Ironside JW |title=Preclinical vCJD after blood transfusion in a PRNP codon 129 heterozygous patient |journal=Lancet |volume=364 |issue=9433 |pages=527–9 |year=2004 |pmid=15302196 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(04)16811-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The finding alarmed healthcare officials because a large [[epidemic]] of the disease could result in the near future. There is no test to determine if a [[blood donor]] is [[infection|infected]] with vCJD.

On May 28, 2002, the [[United States]] [[Food and Drug Administration]] instituted a policy that excludes from donation anyone who spent at least six months in certain European countries, (or three months in the United Kingdom), from 1980 to 1996. Given the large number of U.S. military personnel and their dependents residing in Europe, it was expected that over 7% of donors would be deferred due to the policy. Later changes to this policy have relaxed the restriction to a cumulative total of five years or more of civilian travel in European countries (six months or more if military). The three-month restriction on travel to the UK, however, has not been changed.&lt;ref name=&quot;titleIn-Depth Discussion of Variant Creutzfeld–Jacob Disease and Blood Donation&quot;&gt;{{cite web

The [[American Red Cross]]' policy is as follows:
During the period January 1, 1980, to December 31, 1996, spending a total time of three months or more in the [[Channel Islands]], [[England]], the [[Falkland Islands]], the [[Isle of Man]], [[Gibraltar]], [[Northern Ireland]], [[Scotland]], and [[Wales]] precludes individuals from donating. Moreover, spending a total time of five years or more after January 1, 1980 (to present), in the above-mentioned countries and/or any country in Europe (except the former USSR), also precludes donation. People with a biologic relative who has been diagnosed with CJD or vCJD are unable to donate. Biologic relative in this setting means mother, father, sibling, grandparent, aunt, uncle or children. (For complete listing, please go to [http://www.redcrossblood.org/donating-blood/eligibility-requirements/eligibility-criteria-alphabetical-listing#arc5 Redcross.org])

A similar policy applies to potential donors to the [[Australian Red Cross]]' [[Australian Red Cross Blood Service|Blood Service]], precluding people who have spent a cumulative time of six months or more in the United Kingdom between 1980 and 1996.

The [[Singapore Red Cross]] precludes potential donors who have spent a cumulative time of three months or more in the United Kingdom between 1980 and 1996.

In New Zealand, anyone who has lived in the UK, France or the Republic of Ireland for a total of six months or more between 1980 and 1996 is prohibited from donating blood.

Similar regulations are in place in Germany, where anyone who has spent six months or more living in the UK between January 1980 and December 1996 is permanently barred from donating blood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

As of 1999, [[Health Canada]] announced a policy to defer individuals from donating blood if they have lived within the United Kingdom for one month or more from January 1, 1980, to December 31, 1996. In 2000, the same policy was applied to people who have resided in France, for at least three months from January 1980 to December 1996.

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis of CJD is suspected when there are typical clinical symptoms and signs such as rapidly progressing dementia with myoclonus. Further investigation can then be performed to support the diagnosis including
* [[Electroencephalography]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; often has characteristic triphasic spikes
* [[Cerebrospinal fluid]] analysis for [[14-3-3 protein]]
* [[MRI]] of the brain&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; often shows high signal intensity in the caudate nucleus and putamen bilaterally on T2-weighted images.
* Research in 2010 and 2011 identified a possible blood test for CJD. The test attempts to identify the prion responsible for the disease. However, it was unable to detect the prions in those in early stages of the disease.&lt;ref name=&quot;MSNBC Rettner&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title = Blood test may screen for human form of mad cow |author=By Rachael Rettner |url = http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/41406612/ns/health-infectious_diseases/ |publisher = [[MSNBC]] |date = 2011-02-03 |accessdate = 2011-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Diffusion Weighted Imaging (DWI) images are the most sensitive. In about 24% of cases DWI shows only cortical hyperintensity; in 68%, cortical and subcortical abnormalities; and in 5%, only subcortical anomalies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Young|first= Geoffrey S.|title=Diffusion-Weighted and Fluid-Attenuated Inversion Recovery Imaging in Creutzfeldt–Jakob Disease: High Sensitivity and Specificity for Diagnosis|journal=American Journal of Neuroradiology|volume= 26|pages=1551–1562|date=June–July 2005|publisher=American Society of Neuroradiology|url=http://www.ajnr.org/cgi/content/full/26/6/1551| accessdate =  2007-10-30|pmid=15956529|issue= 6|author2= G|author3= F|author4= M|author5= H|author6= L|author7= L|author8= W|author9= L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clinical testing for CJD has always been an issue. Diagnosis has mostly been based on clinical and physical examination of symptoms. In recent years, studies have shown that the tumour marker Neuron-specific enolase (NSE) is often elevated in CJD cases, however its diagnostic utility is primarily seen when combined with a test for the [[14-3-3 protein]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1212/01.wnl.0000230159.67128.00 |title=CSF tests in the differential diagnosis of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease |author=Sanchez-Juan, P., Green, A., Ladogana, A., et al. |year=2006 |journal=Neurology |volume=67 |issue=4 |pages=637–643 |pmid=16924018}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2010}}, screening tests to identify infected asymptomatic individuals, such as blood donors, are not yet available, though methods have been proposed and evaluated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1537-2995.2010.02731.x|title=A highly sensitive immunoassay for the detection of prion-infected material in whole human blood without the use of proteinase K|author=Tattum, M.

In one third of patients with sporadic CJD, deposits of &quot;prion protein (scrapie),&quot; [[PrpSc|PrP&lt;SUP&gt;Sc&lt;/SUP&gt;]], can be found in the skeletal muscle and/or the spleen{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}. Diagnosis of vCJD can be supported by biopsy of the tonsils, which harbour significant amounts of PrPSc; however, [[biopsy]] of brain tissue is the definitive diagnostic test. Due to its invasiveness, biopsy will not be done if clinical suspicion is sufficiently high or low. A negative biopsy does not rule out CJD, since it may predominate in a specific part of the brain &lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Sternberg's Diagnostic Surgical Pathology, 5th edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:SpongiformChangeCJD.jpg|thumbnail|right|Spongiform change in CJD]]
The classic histologic appearance is spongiform change in the gray matter: the presence of many round vacuoles from one to 50 micrometres in the [[neuropil]], in all six cortical layers in the cerebral cortex or with diffuse involvement of the cerebellar molecular layer. These vacuoles appear glassy or eosinophilic and may coalesce. Neuronal loss and gliosis are also seen.&lt;ref&gt;http://library.med.utah.edu/WebPath/TUTORIAL/CNS/CNSDG.html&lt;/ref&gt; Plaques of amyloid-like material can be seen in the neocortex in new-variant CJD.

Unfortunately, vacuolization can be seen in other disease states. Diffuse cortical vacuolization occurs in Alzheimer's, and superficial cortical vacuolization occurs in ischemia and frontotemporal dementia. These vacuoles appear clear and punched-out. Larger vacuoles encircling neurons, vessels, and glia are a possible processing artifact.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

Both [[amphotericin B]] and [[doxorubicin]] have been investigated as potentially effective against CJD, but as yet there is no strong evidence that either drug is effective in stopping the disease. Further study has been taken with other medical drugs, but none are effective. However, drugs to reduce suffering do exist, and include Valproate, an anticonvulsant, and Clonazepam, to reduce muscle jerks.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gambetti&quot;/&gt;  

Dr. Michael Geschwind, Dr. Bruce Miller and Dr. Stanley Prusiner from [[University of California, San Francisco]] are currently running a [http://memory.ucsf.edu/cjd/research/current/quinacrine treatment trial for sporadic CJD] using [[quinacrine]], a medicine originally created for malaria. Pilot studies showed quinacrine permanently cleared abnormal prion proteins from cell cultures, but results have not yet been published on the clinical study.

==Epidemiology==
[[File:Global mad cow cases map.PNG|thumb|Dark green areas are countries that have confirmed human cases of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and light green are countries that have bovine spongiform encephalopathy cases.]]
Although CJD is the most common human prion disease, it is still rare, occurring in about one out of every one million people every year. It usually affects people aged 45–75, most commonly appearing in people between the ages of 60–65. The exception to this is the more recently-recognised 'variant' CJD (vCJD), which occurs in younger people.

CDC monitors the occurrence of CJD in the United States through periodic reviews of national mortality data. According to the CDC:
* CJD occurs worldwide at a rate of about 1 case per million population per year.
* On the basis of mortality surveillance from 1979 to 1994, the annual [[incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] of CJD remained stable at approximately 1 case per [[million]] persons in the United States.
* In the United States, CJD deaths among persons younger than 30 years of age are extremely rare (fewer than five deaths per [[1000000000 (number)|billion]] per year{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}).
* The disease is found most frequently in patients 55–65 years of age, but cases can occur in people older than 90 years and younger than 55 years of age.
* In more than 85% of cases, the duration of CJD is less than 1 year (median: four months) after onset of symptoms.&lt;ref name=&quot;CDC1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;VCJD1&quot;&gt;{{cite web

===New concerns===
In ''The Lancet'' (June 2006), a University College London team suggested that it may take more than 50 years for vCJD to develop, from their studies of kuru, a similar disease in Papua New Guinea.&lt;ref name = &quot;titleForbes.com&quot;/&gt; The reasoning behind the claim is that kuru was possibly transmitted through cannibalism in Papua New Guinea when family members would eat the body of a dead relative as a sign of [[mourning]]. In the 1950s, cannibalism was banned. In the late 20th century, however, kuru reached epidemic proportions in certain Papua New Guinean communities, therefore suggesting that vCJD may also have a similar [[incubation period]] of 30 to 50 years. A critique to this theory is that while mortuary cannibalism was banned in Papua New Guinea in the 1950s, that does not necessarily mean that the practice ended. 15 years later [[Jared Diamond]] was informed by Papuans that the practice continued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt; Kuru may have passed to the Fore through the preparing of the dead body for burial.

These researchers noticed a genetic variation in some kuru patients that has been known to promote long incubation periods. They have also proposed that individuals who contracted CJD in the early 1990s represent a distinct genetic subpopulation, with unusually short incubation periods for BSE. This means that there may be many more vCJD patients who have longer incubation periods, which may surface many years later.&lt;ref name=&quot;titleForbes.com&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

==History==
The disease was first described by German [[neurologist]] [[Hans Gerhard Creutzfeldt]] in 1920 and shortly afterwards by [[Alfons Maria Jakob]], giving it the name Creutzfeldt&amp;ndash;Jakob. Some of the clinical findings described in their first papers do not match current criteria for Creutzfeldt&amp;ndash;Jakob disease, and it has been speculated that at least two of the patients in initial studies were suffering from a different ailment.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} An early description of familial CJD stems from the German psychiatrist and neurologist [[Friedrich Meggendorfer]] (1880–1953).&lt;ref&gt;Meggendorfer F.

'''Cyril Northcote Parkinson''' (30 July 1909 – 9 March 1993) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] naval historian and author of some sixty books, the most famous of which was his bestseller ''[[Parkinson's Law]]'', which led him  to be also considered as an important [[scholar]] within the field of [[public administration]].

==Early life and education==

The youngest son of William Edward Parkinson (1871–1927), an art master at North East County School and from 1913 principal of York School of Arts and Crafts, and his wife, Rose Emily Mary Curnow (born 1877),  the young Parkinson attended [[St. Peter's School, York]], where in 1929 he won an Exhibition to study history at [[Emmanuel College, Cambridge|Emmanuel College]] at the [[University of Cambridge]].  He received a BA degree in 1932.  As an undergraduate, Parkinson developed an interest in [[naval history]], which he pursued when the Pellew family gave him access to family papers at the recently established [[National Maritime Museum]].  The papers formed the basis of his first book, ''[[Edward Pellew]], Viscount Exmouth, Admiral of the Red''.  In 1934, then enrolled as a graduate student at [[King's College London]], he wrote his Ph.D. thesis on ''Trade and War in the Eastern Seas, 1803-1810'', which was awarded the [[Julian Corbett Prize in Naval History]] for 1935.

==Academic and military career==

While still a graduate student in 1934, Parkinson was commissioned into the [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] as a member of the 22nd London Regiment (The Queen's), was promoted [[Lieutenant]] later the same year, and commanded an infantry company at the jubilee of [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]] in 1935. In the same year, [[Emmanuel College, Cambridge]] elected him a research fellow. While at Cambridge, he commanded an infantry unity of the Cambridge University Officers' Training Corps. He was promoted [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|Captain]] in 1937.

From 1938 to 1945, he held a succession of positions, first becoming senior history master at [[Blundell's School]] in [[Tiverton, Devon]] in 1938 (and also a Captain in the school's OTC), then instructor at the [[Royal Naval College, Dartmouth]] in 1939.  In 1940, he joined the [[Queen's Royal Regiment]] as a Captain and undertook a range of staff and military teaching positions in Britain. In 1943 he married Ethelwyn Edith Graves (born 1915), a nurse tutor at Middlesex Hospital, with whom he was to have two children. 

Demobilized as a [[Major]] in 1945, he was appointed lecturer in history at the [[University of Liverpool]] from 1946 to 1949. In 1950, he was appointed Raffles Professor of History at the newly-established [[University of Malaya]] in [[Singapore]].  While there, he initiated an important series of historical monographs on the history of [[Peninsular Malaysia|Malaya]], publishing the very first of the series in 1960. A movement developed in the mid-1950s to establish two campuses, one in [[Kuala Lumpur]] and one in [[Singapore]]. Parkinson actively attempted to persuade the authorities to avoid dividing the university, but to maintain it to serve both Singapore and Malaya in [[Johor Bahru]]. His efforts were unsuccessful and the two campuses were established in 1959. The original Singapore campus, where Parkinson taught, later became the [[University of Singapore]].

Parkinson and his wife divorced in 1952 and he married the writer and journalist Ann Fry (1921–1983), with whom he had two sons and a daughter. In 1958, while still in Singapore, Parkinson published his most famous work ''[[Parkinson's Law]]'', a book that expanded upon a humorous article that he had first published in the ''Economist'' magazine in November 1955, satirizing government bureaucracies. The 100-page book, first published in the United States and then in Britain, was illustrated by [[Osbert Lancaster]] and became an instant best seller. This collection of short studies explained the inevitability of bureaucratic expansion, arguing that 'work expands to fill the time available for its completion'. Typical of his satire and cynical humour, the book included a discourse on [[Parkinson's Law of Triviality]] (debates about expenses for a nuclear plant, a bicycle shed, and refreshments), a note on why [[driving on the left]] side of the road (see [[road transport]]) is natural, and suggested that the [[Royal Navy]] would eventually have more admirals than ships. After serving as visiting professor at [[Harvard University]] in 1958, and the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign|University of Illinois]] and the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 1959–60, he resigned his post in Singapore at the [[University of Malaya]] to become an independent writer and celebrity. To avoid high taxation in Britain, he moved to the [[Channel Islands]] and settled at [[St Martin's, Guernsey]], where he purchased Les Caches Hall and later restored Annesville Manor. His writings from this period included a series of historical novels, featuring a fictional naval officer from [[Guernsey]], [[Richard Delancey (fictional character)|Richard Delancey]], during the [[Napoleonic era]].

After the death of his second wife in 1984, he married a third time, in 1985 to Iris Hilda Waters (d. 1994) and moved to the [[Isle of Man]]. After two years there, they moved to [[Canterbury]], [[Kent]],&lt;ref&gt;{{openplaque|3292}}&lt;/ref&gt; where Parkinson died in March 1993, at the age of 83. He was buried in Canterbury.

[[Image:IMG RoyalCanalnrKinnegad5706w.jpg|thumb|The [[Royal Canal]] in Ireland.]]
'''Canals''' are man-made channels for water. There are two types of canal:

#[[Aqueduct]]s: [[water supply]] canals that are used for the conveyance and delivery of [[potable]] water for human consumption, [[municipal]] uses, and [[agriculture]] [[irrigation]]. [[Rill]]s and [[acequia]]s are small versions.
#[[Waterway]]s: [[navigable]] [[transport]]ation canals used for carrying ships and boats shipping goods and conveying people.
*Those connected to existing [[lake]]s, [[river]]s, or [[ocean]]s. Included are inter-basin canals, such as the [[Suez Canal]], [[Erie Canal]], and the [[Panama Canal]].
*Those connected in a city network: such as the ''[[Grand Canal (Venice)|Canal Grande]]'' and others of [[Venice]] [[Italy]]; the ''[[gracht]]'' of [[Amsterdam]], and the waterways of [[Bangkok]].

==Types of artificial waterways==
[[Image:MurtfaltalrDanubeChannel.JPG|190px|right|thumb|The [[Danube-Black Sea Canal]] in [[Romania]]]]
Canals are created in one of three ways, or a combination of the three, depending on available water and available path:
* A canal can be created where no stream presently exists. Either the body of the canal is dug or the sides of the canal are created by piling dirt, stone, concrete, or other building materials. The water for the canal must be provided from an external source like other streams or reservoirs. Examples include canals that connect valleys over a higher body of land, like [[Canal du Midi]] and [[Canal de Briare]].
* A stream can be ''[[canalized]]'' to make its navigable path more predictable and easier to maneuver. [[canalized|Canalization]] modifies the stream to more safely carry traffic by controlling the flow of the stream with dredging, damming, and modifying its path. Examples include [[Basse Saône]], [[Canal de Mines de Fer de la Moselle]], and [[Aisne (river)#Canalized portion|Aisne River]]. [[Riparian zone restoration]] may be required.
* When a stream is too difficult to modify with ''[[canalized|canalization]]'', a second stream can be created next to the existing stream. This is called a ''[[lateral canal]]''. The existing stream usually acts as the water source and its banks provide a path for the new body. Examples include the [[Chesapeake and Ohio Canal]], [[Canal latéral à la Loire]], [[Garonne Lateral Canal]], and [[Canal latéral à l'Aisne]].

Smaller transportation canals can carry [[barge]]s or [[narrowboat]]s, while [[ship canal]]s allow seagoing [[ship]]s to travel to an inland port (e.g., [[Manchester Ship Canal]]), or from one sea or ocean to another (e.g., [[Caledonian Canal]], [[Panama Canal]]).

==Features==

On the right is a path and on both sides grass and vegetation.|thumb|left|The flight of 16 consecutive locks at [[Caen Hill Locks|Caen Hill]] on the [[Kennet and Avon Canal]], [[Wiltshire]], [[England]]]]
[[Image:pontcysyllte aqueduct arp.jpg|thumb|left|A canal boat traverses the longest and highest aqueduct in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], at [[Pontcysyllte Aqueduct|Pontcysyllte]] in [[Denbighshire]], [[Wales]]]]

At their simplest, canals consist of a trench filled with water. Depending on the [[stratum]] the canal passes through, it may be necessary to line the cut with some form of watertight material such as clay or concrete. When this is done with clay this is known as [[Puddling (engineering)|puddling]].

Canals need to be level, and, while small irregularities in the lie of the land can be dealt with through cuttings and embankments, for larger deviations, other approaches have been adopted. The most common is the [[pound lock]], which consists of a chamber within which the water level can be raised or lowered connecting either two pieces of canal at a different level or the canal with a river or the sea. When there is a hill to be climbed, flights of many locks in short succession may be used.

Prior to the development of the pound lock in 984AD in China by Chhaio Wei-Yo&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hadfield|1986|p=22.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later in Europe in the 15th century, either [[Canal lock#Flash locks|flash lock]]s consisting of a single gate were used or ramps, sometimes equipped with rollers, were used to change level. Flash locks were only practical where there was plenty of water available.

Locks use a lot of water, so builders have adopted other approaches. These include [[boat lift]]s, such as the [[Falkirk wheel]], which use a [[Caisson (water transport)|caisson]] of water in which boats float while being moved between two levels; and [[canal inclined plane|inclined plane]]s where a caisson is hauled up a steep railway.

To cross a stream or road, the solution is usually to bridge with an [[aqueduct]]. To cross a wide valley (where the journey delay caused by a flight of locks at either side would be unacceptable) the centre of the valley can be spanned by an aqueduct - a famous example in Wales is the [[Pontcysyllte]] aqueduct across the valley of the River [[Dee]].

Another option for dealing with hills is to tunnel through them. An example of this approach is the [[Harecastle Tunnel]] on the [[Trent and Mersey Canal]]. Tunnels are only practical for smaller canals.

Some canals attempted to keep changes in level down to a minimum. These canals known as [[contour canal]]s would take longer winding routes, along which the land was a uniform altitude. Other generally later canals took more direct routes requiring the use of various methods to deal with the change in level.

Canals have various features to tackle the problem of water supply. In some cases such as the Suez Canal the canal is simply open to the sea. Where the canal is not at sea level a number of approaches have been adopted. Taking water from existing rivers or springs was an option in some cases, sometimes supplemented by other methods to deal with seasonal variations in flow. Where such sources were unavailable, [[reservoirs]] - either separate from the canal or built into its course - and [[back pumping]] were used to provide the required water. In other cases, water pumped from mines was used to feed the canal. In certain cases, extensive &quot;feeder canals&quot; were built to bring water from sources located far from the canal. 

Where large amounts of goods are loaded or unloaded such as at the end of a canal a [[canal basin]] may be built. This would normally be a section of water wider than the general canal. In some cases, the canal basins contain [[wharf]]s and cranes to assist with movement of goods.

When a section of the canal needs to be sealed off so it can be drained for maintenance [[stop planks]] are frequently used. These consist of planks of wood placed across the canal to form a dam. They are generally placed in pre existing grooves in the canal bank. On more modern canals, &quot;guard locks&quot; or gates were sometimes placed to allow a section of canal to be quickly closed off, either for maintenance, or to prevent a major loss of water due to a canal breach.

==History==
===Ancient canals===
{{See also|List of Roman canals}}
[[Image:Kaiserkanal01.jpg|thumb|right|The Grand Canal of China at Suzhou]]
The oldest known canals were [[irrigation]] canals, built in [[Mesopotamia]] circa 4000 BC, in what is now modern day [[Iraq]] and [[Syria]]. The [[Indus Valley Civilization]], in [[Pakistan]] and [[North India]], (circa 2600 BC) had sophisticated irrigation and storage systems developed, including the [[reservoir]]s built at [[Girnar]] in 3000 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rodda|2004|p=161.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Egypt]], canals date back at least to the time of [[Pepi I Meryre]] (reigned 2332–2283 BC), who ordered a canal built to bypass the [[Cataracts of the Nile|cataract]] on the Nile near [[Aswan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hadfield|1986|p=16.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[ancient China]], large canals for river transport were established as far back as the [[Warring States]] (481–221 BC), the longest one of that period being the Hong Gou (Canal of the Wild Geese), which according to the ancient [[historian]] [[Sima Qian]] connected the old states of Song, Zhang, Chen, Cai, Cao, and Wei.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Needham|1971|p=269.}}&lt;/ref&gt; By far the longest canal was the [[Grand Canal of China]], still the longest canal in the world today. It is {{convert|1794|km|mi}} long and was built to carry the [[Emperor Yang of Sui China|Emperor Yang Guang]] between [[Beijing]] and [[Hangzhou]]. The project began in 605 and was completed in 609, although much of the work combined older canals, the oldest section of the canal existing since at least 486 BC. Even in its narrowest urban sections it is rarely less than {{convert|30|m|ft}} wide.

[[Greek engineering|Greek engineers]] were the first to use [[Lock (water transport)|canal locks]], by which they regulated the water flow in the [[Ancient Suez Canal]] as early as the 3rd&amp;nbsp;century&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, Frank Gardner (1950): &quot;Three Canal Projects, Roman and Byzantine&quot;, ''[[American Journal of Archaeology]]'', Vol. 54, No. 2, pp. 97–111 (99–101)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Froriep 1986, 46&quot;&gt;Froriep, Siegfried (1986): &quot;Ein Wasserweg in Bithynien.

===Canals in the Middle Ages===
[[File:Thal Canal.JPG|right|250px|thumb|Thal Canal, [[Punjab Pakistan|Punjab]], Pakistan.]]

In the [[Middle Ages]], water transport was cheaper and faster than transport overland. This was because roads were unpaved and in poor condition and greater amounts could be transported by ship. The first artificial canal in [[Christendom|Christian Europe]] was the [[Fossa Carolina]] built at the end of the 8th Century under personal supervision of [[Charlemagne]]. More lasting and of more economic impact were canals like the [[Naviglio Grande]] built between 1127 and 1257, the most important of the [[Lombardy|lombard]] “[[navigli]]”,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Calvert|1963|p=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, canals were built in the [[Netherlands]] and [[Flanders]] to drain the [[polder]]s and assist the transportation of goods.

Canal building was revived in this age because of commercial expansion from the 12th century AD. River navigations were improved progressively by the use of single, or [[flash lock]]s. Taking boats through these used large amounts of water leading to conflicts with [[watermill]] owners and to correct this, the [[Pound lock|pound]] or chamber lock first appeared, in 10th century AD in China and in Europe in 1373 in [[Vreeswijk]], Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = The International Canal Monuments List | url = http://www.icomos.org/studies/canals.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2008-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another important development was the [[mitre gate]], which was, it is presumed, introduced in Italy by Bertola da Novate in the 16th century. This allowed wider gates and also removed the height restriction of [[guillotine lock]]s.

To break out of the limitations caused by river valleys, the first [[summit level canal]]s were developed with the [[Grand Canal of China]] in 581–617 AD whilst in Europe the first, also using single locks, was the [[Stecknitz Canal]] in Germany in 1398. The first to use pound locks was the [[Briare Canal]] connecting the [[Loire]] and [[Seine]] (1642), followed by the more ambitious [[Canal du Midi]] (1683) connecting the [[Atlantic]] to the [[Mediterranean]]. This included a staircase of 8 locks at Béziers, a {{convert|157|m|ft}} tunnel and three major [[aqueduct]]s.

Canal building progressed steadily in Germany in the 17th and 18th centuries with three great rivers, the [[Elbe]], [[Oder]] and [[Weser]] being linked by canals. In post-Roman Britain, the first canal built appears to have been the [[Exeter Canal]], which opened in 1563. The oldest canal built for industrial purposes in North America is [[Mother Brook]] in [[Dedham, MA]]. It was constructed in 1639 to provide water power for mills. In [[Russia]], the [[Volga-Baltic Waterway]], a nationwide canal system connecting the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] and [[Caspian sea]]s via the [[Neva]] and [[Volga]] rivers, was opened in 1718.

===Industrial revolution===
[[Image:Canal system in Lowell, Massachusetts.png|thumb|right|200px|Lowell's power canal system]]
:{{See also|History of the British canal system}}
Canals were important for industrial development. The greatest stimulus to canal system building came from the [[Industrial Revolution]] with its need for cheap transport of unprecedented quantities of raw materials and manufactured items.

In Europe, particularly Britain and Ireland, and then in the young United States and the Canadian colonies, inland canals preceded the development of [[railroad]]s during the earliest phase of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. The opening of the [[Sankey Canal]] in 1757, followed by the [[Bridgewater Canal]] in 1761, which halved the price of coal in [[Liverpool]] and [[Manchester]], respectively, triggered a period of &quot;canal mania&quot; in Britain so that between 1760 and 1820 over one hundred canals were built.

As well as industrial uses, the [[Royal Military Canal]] on the Romney Marsh was built so as create a barrier against invading troops, and hiding places for British troops during the Napoleonic Wars&lt;ref&gt;http://www.royalmilitarycanal.com/pages/history.asp&lt;/ref&gt;.

The [[Blackstone Canal]] in [[Massachusetts]] and [[Rhode Island]] fulfilled a similar role in the early industrial revolution between 1828–48. The [[Blackstone Valley]] was a major contributor of the American Industrial Revolution where [[Samuel Slater]] built his first mill.

In addition to their transportation purposes, parts of the United States, particularly in the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]], had enough fast-flowing rivers that [[water power]] was the primary means of powering factories (usually textile mills) until after the [[American Civil War]]. For example, [[Lowell, Massachusetts]], considered to be &quot;The Cradle of the American Industrial Revolution,&quot; has {{convert|6|mi| km}} of canals, built from around 1790 to 1850, that provided water power and a means of transportation for the city. The output of the system is estimated at 10,000 [[horsepower]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.nps.gov/archive/lowe/loweweb/Lowell%20History/prologue.htm | title = Lowell National Historical Park — Lowell History Prologue | publisher = | accessdate = 2008-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other cities with extensive power canal systems include [[Lawrence, Massachusetts]], [[Holyoke, Massachusetts]], [[Manchester, New Hampshire]], and [[Augusta Canal|Augusta, Georgia]].

===The 19th century===
[[Image:Canals USA 1825.png|thumb|right|US canals circa 1825]]
Competition from the railway network from the 1830s, and in the 20th century the roads, made the smaller canals obsolete for most commercial transportation, and many of the British canals fell into decay. Only the [[Manchester Ship Canal]] and the [[Aire and Calder Canal]] bucked this trend. Yet in other countries canals grew in size as construction techniques improved. During the 19th century in the US, the length of canals grew from {{convert|100|mi|km|0}} to over 4,000, with a complex network making the [[Great Lakes]] navigable, in conjunction with [[Canada]], although some canals were later drained and used as railroad [[Right-of-way (railroad)|rights-of-way]].

In the United States, navigable canals reached into isolated areas and brought them in touch with the world beyond. By 1825 the [[Erie Canal]], {{convert|363|mi|km}} long with 82 locks, opened up a connection from the populated Northeast to the [[Great Lakes]]. Settlers flooded into regions serviced by such canals, since access to markets was available. The Erie Canal (as well as other canals) was instrumental in lowering the differences in commodity prices between these various markets across America. The canals caused price convergence between different regions because of their reduction in transportation costs, which allowed Americans to ship and buy goods from farther distances for much lower prices compared to before. Ohio built many miles of canal, Indiana had working canals for a few decades, and the [[Illinois and Michigan Canal]] connected the Great Lakes to the [[Mississippi River]] system until replaced by a channelized river waterway.

Three major canals with very different purposes were built in what is now Canada. The first [[Welland Canal]], which opened in 1829 between [[Lake Ontario]] and [[Lake Erie]], bypassing [[Niagara Falls]] and the [[Lachine Canal]] (1825), which allowed ships to skirt the nearly impassable rapids on the [[St. Lawrence River]] at [[Montreal]] were built for commerce. The [[Rideau Canal]], completed in 1832, connects [[Ottawa]], on the [[Ottawa River]] to [[Kingston, Ontario]] on [[Lake Ontario]]. The Rideau Canal was built as a result of the [[War of 1812]] to provide military transportation between the British colonies of [[Upper Canada]] and [[Lower Canada]] as an alternative to part of the St. Lawrence River, which was susceptible to blockade by the United States.

In France, a steady linking of all the river systems&amp;mdash;[[Rhine]], [[Rhône]], [[Saône]], and [[Seine]]&amp;mdash;and the North Sea was boosted in 1879 by the establishment of the [[Freycinet gauge]], which specified the minimum size of locks so that canal traffic doubled in the first decades of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Edwards|2002|p=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many notable sea canals were completed in this period, starting with the [[Suez Canal]] (1869), and the [[Kiel Canal]] (1897), which carries tonnage many times that of most other canals, though the [[Panama Canal]] was not opened until 1914.

In the 19th century, a number of canals were built in Japan including the [[Biwako canal]] and the [[Tone canal]]. These canals were partially built with the help of engineers from the Netherlands and other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hadfield|1986|p=191.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern uses===
[[File:Viewing man-made canals in the marsh in Louisiana, Barataria Basin.jpg|right|thumb|Canals can disrupt water circulation in marsh systems.]]
Large-scale ship canals such as the [[Panama Canal]] and [[Suez Canal]] continue to operate for cargo transportation, as do European barge canals. Due to [[globalization]], they are becoming increasingly important, resulting in expansion projects such as the [[Panama Canal expansion project]].

The narrow early industrial canals, however, have ceased to carry significant amounts of trade and many have been abandoned to navigation, but may still be used as a system for transportation of untreated water. In some cases railways have been built along the canal route, an example being the [[Croydon Canal]].

A movement that began in Britain and France to use the early industrial canals for pleasure boats, such as [[hotel barge]]s, has spurred rehabilitation of stretches of historic canals. In some cases, abandoned canals such as the [[Kennet and Avon Canal]] have been restored and are now used by pleasure boaters. In Britain, canalside housing has also proven popular in recent years.

The [[Seine-Nord Europe Canal]] is being developed into a major transportation waterway, linking [[France]] with [[Belgium]], [[Germany]], and the [[Netherlands]].

Canals have found another use in the 21st century, as [[easement]]s for the installation of [[fibre optic]] [[telecommunications]] network cabling, avoiding having them buried in roadways while facilitating access and reducing the hazard of being damaged from digging equipment.

Canals are still used to provide water for agriculture. An extensive canal system exists within the [[Imperial Valley]] in the Southern California desert to provide irrigation to agriculture within the area.

==Cities on water==
[[Image:KeizersgrachtReguliersgrachtAmsterdam.jpg|thumb|left|An intersection of two canals ([[Gracht]]en) in [[Amsterdam]], [[Netherlands]].]]
[[File:Griboyedov Canal 2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Griboyedov Canal]] in [[St. Petersburg]], [[Russia]].]]
Canals are so deeply identified with [[Venice]] that many canal cities have been nicknamed &quot;the Venice of…&quot;. The city is built on marshy islands, with wooden piles supporting the buildings, so that the land is man-made rather than the waterways. The islands have a long history of settlement; by the 12th century, Venice was a powerful [[city state]].

[[Amsterdam]] was built in a similar way, with buildings on wooden piles. It became a city around 1300.

Other cities with extensive canal networks include: [[Alkmaar]], [[Amersfoort]], [[Bolsward]], [[Brielle]], [[Delft]], [[Den Bosch]], [[Dokkum]], [[Dordrecht]], [[Enkhuizen]], [[Franeker]], [[Gouda]], [[Haarlem]], [[Harlingen]], [[Leeuwarden]], [[Leiden]], [[Sneek]] and [[Utrecht]] in the [[Netherlands]], [[Brugge]] and [[Gent]] in [[Flanders]], [[Belgium]], [[Birmingham]] in [[England]] — which has 35 miles of canals, to Venice's 26 miles —, [[Saint Petersburg]] in [[Russia]], [[Hamburg]] in [[Germany]], [[Berlin]] in [[Germany]] , [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida]], and [[Cape Coral, Florida]] in the [[United States]].

[[Liverpool Maritime Mercantile City]] is a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] near the centre of [[Liverpool]], England, where a system of intertwining waterways and docks now being developed for mainly residential and leisure use.

Canal Estates (commonly known as bayous) are a form of [[Subdivision (land)|subdivision]] popular in cities like [[Miami, Florida]], [[Texas City, Texas]] and the [[Gold Coast, Queensland]]; the Gold Coast has over 700&amp;nbsp;km of residential canals. [[Wetlands]] are difficult areas upon which to build housing estates, so [[dredging]] part of the wetland down to a [[navigable]] channel provides fill to build up another part of the wetland above the flood level for houses. Land is built up in a finger pattern that provides a suburban street layout of waterfront housing blocks.

==Boats==
[[Image:Panama Canal Miraflores Locks.jpg|thumb|right|Two [[Panamax]] ships in the [[Miraflores (Panama)|Miraflores Locks]] on the [[Panama Canal]], [[Panama]].]]
Inland canals have often had boats specifically built for them. An example of this is the British [[narrowboat]], which is up to {{convert|72|ft|m|2}} long and {{convert|7|ft|m|2}} wide and was primarily built for British Midland canals. In this case the limiting factor was the size of the locks. This is also the limiting factor on the Panama canal where [[Panamax]] ships are limited to a length of {{convert|294.1|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} and a width of {{convert|32.3|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}. For the lockless [[Suez Canal]] the limiting factor for [[Suezmax]] ships is generally draft, which is limited to {{convert|16|m|ft|1|abbr=on}}. At the other end of the scale, tub-boat canals such as the [[Bude Canal]] were limited to boats of under 10 tons for much of their length due to the capacity of their inclined planes or boat lifts. Most canals have a limit on height imposed either by [[bridge]]s or by [[tunnel]]s.

{{science}}
'''Cognitive science''' is the interdisciplinary scientific study of minds as information processors.  It includes research on how information is processed (in faculties such as perception, language, reasoning, and emotion), represented, and transformed in a (human or other animal) nervous system or machine (e.g., computer). Cognitive science consists of multiple research disciplines, including [[psychology]], [[artificial intelligence]], [[philosophy]], [[neuroscience]], [[linguistics]], [[anthropology]], [[sociology]], and [[education]].&lt;ref&gt;Thagard, Paul, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2008/entries/cognitive-science/ Cognitive Science], The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2008 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.).&lt;/ref&gt; It spans many levels of analysis, from low-level learning and decision mechanisms to high-level logic and planning; from neural circuitry to modular brain organization. The term ''cognitive science'' was coined by [[H. Christopher Longuet-Higgins|Christopher Longuet-Higgins]] in his 1973 commentary on the [[Lighthill report]], which concerned the then-current state of [[Artificial Intelligence]] research.&lt;ref&gt;
Longuet-Higgins, H. C. (1973). &quot;Comments on the Lighthill Report and the Sutherland Reply&quot;, in ''Artificial Intelligence: a paper symposium'', Science Research Council, 35-37&lt;/ref&gt; In the same decade, the journal ''[[Cognitive Science (journal)|Cognitive Science]]'' and the [[Cognitive Science Society]] were founded.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cognitivesciencesociety.org/about_description.html Cognitive Science Society]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Cognitive science has a pre-history traceable back to ancient Greek philosophical texts (see Plato's [[Meno]]); and certainly must include writers such as [[Descartes]], [[David Hume]], [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Benedict de Spinoza]], [[Nicolas Malebranche]], [[Pierre Cabanis]], [[Leibniz]] and [[John Locke]].  But, although these early writers contributed greatly to the philosophical discovery of [[mind]] and this would ultimately lead to the development of psychology, they were working with an entirely different set of tools and core concepts than those of the cognitive scientist.

The modern culture of cognitive science can be traced back to the early [[cybernetics|cyberneticists]] in the 1930s and 1940s, such as [[Warren McCulloch]] and [[Walter Pitts]], who sought to understand the organizing principles of the mind. McCulloch and Pitts developed the first variants of what are now known as [[artificial neural networks]], models of computation inspired by the structure of [[biological neural networks]].

Another precursor was the early development of the [[theory of computation]] and the [[digital computer]] in the 1940s and 1950s. [[Alan Turing]] and [[John von Neumann]] were instrumental in these developments. The modern computer, or [[Von Neumann machine]], would play a central role in cognitive science, both as a metaphor for the mind, and as a tool for investigation.

In 1959, [[Noam Chomsky]] published a scathing review of [[B. F. Skinner]]'s book [[Verbal Behavior]]. At the time, Skinner's [[behaviorist]] paradigm dominated psychology: Most psychologists focused on functional relations between stimulus and response, without positing internal representations. Chomsky argued that in order to explain language, we needed a theory like [[generative grammar]], which not only attributed internal representations but characterized their underlying order.

In the 1970s and early 1980s, much cognitive science research focused on the possibility of [[artificial intelligence]]. Researchers such as [[Marvin Minsky]] would write computer programs in languages such as [[LISP]] to attempt to formally characterize the steps that human beings went through, for instance, in making decisions and solving problems, in the hope of better understanding human thought, and also in the hope of creating artificial minds. This approach is known as &quot;symbolic AI&quot;.

Eventually the limits of the symbolic AI research program became apparent. For instance, it seemed to be unrealistic to comprehensively list human knowledge in a form usable by a symbolic computer program. The late 80s and 90s saw the rise of [[neural networks]] and [[connectionism]] as a research paradigm. Under this point of view, often attributed to [[James McClelland (psychologist)|James McClelland]] and [[David Rumelhart]], the mind could be characterized as a set of complex associations, represented as a layered network.  Critics argue that there are some phenomena which are better captured by symbolic models, and that connectionist models are often so complex as to have little explanatory power. Recently symbolic and connectionist models have been combined, making it possible to take advantage of both forms of explanation.&lt;ref&gt;Artur S. d'Avila Garcez, Luis C. Lamb and Dov M. Gabbay. Neural-Symbolic Cognitive Reasoning. Cognitive Technologies. Springer, 2008, ISBN 978-3-540-73245-7, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principles==
===Levels of analysis===
A central tenet of cognitive science is that a complete understanding of the mind/brain cannot be attained by studying only a single level. An example would be the problem of remembering a phone number and recalling it later. One approach to understanding this process would be to study behavior through direct observation. A person could be presented with a phone number, asked to recall it after some delay. Then the accuracy of the response could be measured. Another approach would be to study the firings of individual neurons while a person is trying to remember the phone number. Neither of these experiments on their own would fully explain how the process of remembering a phone number works. Even if the technology to map out every neuron in the brain in real-time were available, and it were known when each neuron was firing, it would still be impossible to know how a particular firing of neurons translates into the observed behavior. Thus an understanding of how these two levels relate to each other is needed. This can be provided by a functional level account of the process. Studying a particular phenomenon from multiple levels creates a better understanding of the processes that occur in the brain to give rise to a particular behavior.
[[David Marr (psychologist)|Marr]]&lt;ref&gt;Marr, D. (1982). ''Vision: A Computational Investigation into the Human Representation and Processing of Visual Information''. W. H. Freeman.&lt;/ref&gt; gave a famous description of three levels of analysis:

# the ''computational theory'', specifying the goals of the computation;
# ''representation and algorithm'', giving a representation of the input and output and the algorithm which transforms one into the other; and
# the ''hardware implementation'', how algorithm and representation may be physically realized.

(See also the entry on [[Functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism]].)

===Interdisciplinary nature===
Cognitive science is an interdisciplinary field with contributors from various fields, including [[psychology]], [[neuroscience]], [[linguistics]], [[philosophy of mind]], [[computer science]], [[anthropology]], [[sociology]], and [[biology]].  Cognitive science tends to view the world outside the mind much as other sciences do. Thus it too has an objective, observer-independent existence. The field is usually seen as compatible with the physical sciences, and uses the [[scientific method]] as well as [[simulation]] or [[model (abstract)|modeling]], often comparing the output of models with aspects of human behavior. Some doubt whether there is a unified cognitive science, and prefer to speak of the cognitive sciences in plural.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, G. A. (2003). The cognitive revolution: a historical perspective. Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 7, 141-144.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many, but not all, who consider themselves cognitive scientists have a [[functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalist]] view of the mind&amp;mdash;the view that mental states are classified functionally, such that any system that performs the proper function for some mental state is considered to be in that mental state.  According to some versions of functionalism, even non-human systems, such as other animal species, alien life forms, or advanced computers can, in principle, have mental states.

===''Cognitive'' science: the term===
The term &quot;cognitive&quot; in &quot;cognitive science&quot; is &quot;used for any kind of mental operation or structure that can be studied in precise terms&quot; ([[George Lakoff|Lakoff]] and [[Mark Johnson (professor)|Johnson]], 1999). This conceptualization is very broad, and should not be confused with how &quot;cognitive&quot; is used in some traditions of [[analytic philosophy]], where &quot;cognitive&quot; has to do only with formal rules and truth conditional semantics.

The earliest entries for the word &quot;''cognitive''&quot; in the [[Oxford English Dictionary|OED]] take it to mean roughly ''pertaining &quot;to the action or process of knowing&quot;''. The first entry, from 1586, shows the word was at one time used in the context of discussions of [[Plato]]nic theories of [[knowledge]]. Most in cognitive science, however, presumably do not believe their field is the study of anything as certain as the knowledge sought by Plato.

==Scope==
Cognitive science is a large field, and covers a wide array of topics on cognition. However, it should be recognized that cognitive science is not equally concerned with every topic that might bear on the nature and operation of the mind or intelligence. Social and cultural factors, emotion, consciousness, [[animal cognition]], [[comparative psychology|comparative]] and [[evolutionary psychology|evolutionary]] approaches are frequently de-emphasized or excluded outright, often based on key philosophical conflicts. Another important mind-related subject that the cognitive sciences tend to avoid is the existence of [[qualia]], with discussions over this issue being sometimes limited to only mentioning qualia as a philosophically-open matter. Some within the cognitive science community, however, consider these to be vital topics, and advocate the importance of investigating them.&lt;ref&gt;A number of authors consider the qualia problem to be part of the cognitive science field, e.g. [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=166791.166844 Some philosophical issues in cognitive science: qualia, intentionality, and the mind-body problem], [http://chil.rice.edu/byrne/Pubs/cogsci96.pdf Qualia: The Hard Problem], and indeed the entire discipline of philosophy as being part of the cog sci field, e.g. [http://ls.berkeley.edu/ugis/cogsci/major/about.php What is Cognitive Science?], while other reputable sources that cover both qualia and cog sci do not draw any obvious connection between them, e.g. the [http://plato.stanford.edu Stanford encyclopedia of philosophy] (Jan 2008 online edition) does have full-size articles on both [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qualia/ qualia] and [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/cognitive-science/ cog sci], but qualia are not even mentioned in the cog sci article while cog sci is not mentioned in the qualia article.&lt;/ref&gt;

Below are some of the main topics that cognitive science is concerned with. This is not an exhaustive list, but is meant to cover the wide range of intelligent behaviors. See [[List of cognitive science topics]] for a list of various aspects of the field.

===Artificial intelligence===
{{Main|Artificial intelligence}}

''&quot;... One major contribution of AI and cognitive science to psychology has been the information processing model of human thinking in which the metaphor of brain-as-computer is taken quite literally.
.&quot;'' [http://www.aaai.org/AITopics/html/cogsci.html#simon AAAI Web pages].

Artificial intelligence (AI) involves the study of cognitive phenomena in machines. One of the practical goals of AI is to implement aspects of human intelligence in computers. Computers are also widely used as a tool with which to study cognitive phenomena. [[computer model|Computational modeling]] uses simulations to study how human intelligence may be structured.&lt;ref&gt;Sun, Ron (ed.) (2008). The Cambridge Handbook of Computational Psychology. Cambridge University Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; (See the section on computational modeling in the Research Methods section.)

There is some debate in the field as to whether the mind is best viewed as a huge array of small but individually feeble elements (i.e. neurons), or as a collection of higher-level structures such as symbols, schemas, plans, and rules. The former view uses [[connectionism]] to study the mind, whereas the latter emphasizes symbolic computations. One way to view the issue is whether it is possible to accurately simulate a human brain on a computer without accurately simulating the neurons that make up the human brain.

===Attention===
{{Main|Attention}}

Attention is the selection of important information.  The human mind is bombarded with millions of stimuli and it must have a way of deciding which of this information to process.  Attention is sometimes seen as a spotlight, meaning one can only shine the light on a particular set of information.  Experiments that support this metaphor include the [[dichotic listening]] task (Cherry, 1957) and studies of inattentional blindness (Mack and Rock, 1998).  In the dichotic listening task, subjects are bombarded with two different messages, one in each ear, and told to focus on only one of the messages.  At the end of the experiment, when asked about the content of the unattended message, subjects cannot report it.

===Knowledge, and Processing, of Language===
[[Image:Cgisf-tgg.svg|thumb|230px||A [[Colorless green ideas sleep furiously|well known example]] of a [[Phrase structure rules|Phrase structure tree]]. This is one way of representing human language that shows how different components are organized hierarchically. ]]
{{Main|Theoretical linguistics|Cognitive linguistics|Language|Linguistics|Psycholinguistics}}

The ability to learn and understand language is an extremely complex process. Language is acquired within the first few years of life, and all humans under normal circumstances are able to acquire language proficiently. A major driving force in the theoretical linguistic field is discovering the nature that language must have in the abstract in order to be learned in such a fashion. Some of the driving research questions in studying how the brain itself processes language include: (1) To what extent is linguistic knowledge innate or learned?, (2) Why is it more difficult for adults to acquire a second-language than it is for infants to acquire their first-language?, and (3) How are humans able to understand novel sentences?

The study of language processing ranges from the investigation of the sound patterns of speech to the meaning of words and whole sentences. [[Linguistics]] often divides language processing into [[orthography]], [[phonology]] and [[phonetics]], [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], [[syntax]], [[semantics]], and [[pragmatics]]. Many aspects of language can be studied from each of these components and from their interaction.

The study of language processing in '''cognitive science''' is closely tied to the field of linguistics. Linguistics was traditionally studied as a part of the humanities, including studies of history, art and literature. In the last fifty years or so, more and more researchers have studied knowledge and use of language as a cognitive phenomenon, the main problems being how knowledge of language can be acquired and used, and what precisely it consists of. [[Linguistics|Linguists]] have found that, while humans form sentences in ways apparently governed by very complex systems, they are remarkably unaware of the rules that govern their own speech. Thus linguists must resort to indirect methods to determine what those rules might be, if indeed rules as such exist. In any event, if speech is indeed governed by rules, they appear to be opaque to any conscious consideration.

===Learning and development===
{{Main|Learning|Developmental psychology}}

Learning and development are the processes by which we acquire knowledge and information over time. Infants are born with little or no knowledge (depending on how knowledge is defined), yet they rapidly acquire the ability to use language, walk, and recognize people and objects. Research in learning and development aims to explain the mechanisms by which these processes might take place.

A major question in the study of cognitive development is the extent to which certain abilities are [[innate]] or learned. This is often framed in terms of the [[nature versus nurture]] debate. The [[Psychological nativism|nativist]] view emphasizes that certain features are innate to an organism and are determined by its [[genetics|genetic]] endowment. The [[Empiricism|empiricist]] view, on the other hand, emphasizes that certain abilities are learned from the environment. Although clearly both genetic and environmental input is needed for a child to develop normally, considerable debate remains about ''how'' genetic information might guide cognitive development. In the area of [[language acquisition]], for example, some (such as [[Steven Pinker]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Pinker S., Bloom P.|title=Natural language and natural selection|year=1990|journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences|issue=4|pages=707–784|volume=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; have argued that specific information containing universal grammatical rules must be contained in the genes, whereas others (such as Jeffrey Elman and colleagues in [[Rethinking Innateness]]) have argued that Pinker's claims are biologically unrealistic. They argue that genes determine the architecture of a learning system, but that specific &quot;facts&quot; about how grammar works can only be learned as a result of experience.

===Memory===
{{Main|Memory}}

Memory allows us to store information for later retrieval. Memory is often thought of consisting of both a long-term and short-term store. Long-term memory allows us to store information over prolonged periods (days, weeks, years). We do not yet know the practical limit of long-term memory capacity. Short-term memory allows us to store information over short time scales (seconds or minutes).

Memory is also often grouped into declarative and procedural forms. [[Declarative memory]]--grouped into subsets of [[Semantic memory|semantic]] and [[Episodic memory|episodic forms of memory]]--refers to our memory for facts and specific knowledge, specific meanings, and specific experiences (e.g., Who was the first president of the U.S.A.?, or &quot;What did I eat for breakfast four days ago?). [[Procedural memory]] allows us to remember actions and motor sequences (e.g. how to ride a bicycle) and is often dubbed implicit knowledge or memory .

Cognitive scientists study memory just as psychologists do, but tend to focus in more on how memory bears on [[cognitive process]]es, and the interrelationship between cognition and memory. One example of this could be, what mental processes does a person go through to retrieve a long-lost memory? Or, what differentiates between the cognitive process of recognition (seeing hints of something before remembering it, or memory in context) and recall (retrieving a memory, as in &quot;fill-in-the-blank&quot;)?

===Perception and action===
[[Image:Necker cube.svg|thumb|150px|The Necker cube, an example of an optical illusion]]

{{Main|Perception}}

Perception is the ability to take in information via the [[senses]], and process it in some way. [[Visual perception|Vision]] and [[Hearing (sense)|hearing]] are two dominant senses that allow us to perceive the environment. Some questions in the study of visual perception, for example, include: (1) How are we able to recognize objects?, (2) Why do we perceive a continuous visual environment, even though we only see small bits of it at any one time? One tool for studying visual perception is by looking at how people process [[optical illusion]]s. The image on the right of a Necker cube is an example of a bistable percept, that is, the cube can be interpreted as being oriented in two different directions.

The study of [[Haptic perception|haptic]] ([[tactile]]), [[olfactory]], and [[gustatory]] stimuli also fall into the domain of perception.

Action is taken to refer to the output of a system. In humans, this is accomplished through motor responses. Spatial planning and movement, speech production, and complex motor movements are all aspects of action.

==Research methods==
Many different methodologies are used to study cognitive science. As the field is highly interdisciplinary, research often cuts across multiple areas of study, drawing on research methods from [[psychology]], [[neuroscience]], [[computer science]] and [[systems theory]].

===Behavioral experiments===
In order to have a description of what constitutes intelligent behavior, one must study behavior itself. This type of research is closely tied to that in [[cognitive psychology]] and [[psychophysics]]. By measuring behavioral responses to different stimuli, one can understand something about how those stimuli are processed. Lewandowski and Strohmetz (2009) review a collection of innovative uses of behavioral measurement in psychology including behavioral traces, behavioral observations, and behavioral choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| title = Actions can speak as loud as words: Measuring behavior in psychological science | first1 = Gary | last1 = Lewandowski | first2 = David | last2 = Strohmetz | journal = Social and Personality Psychology Compass | volume = 3 | issue = 6 | year = 2009| pages = 992–1002 | doi = 10.1111/j.1751-9004.2009.00229  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Behavioral traces are pieces of evidence that indicate behavior occurred , but the actor is not present (e.g., litter in a parking lot or readings on an electric meter). Behavioral observations involve the direct witnessing of the actor engaging in the behavior (e.g., watching how close a person sits next to another person). Behavioral choices are when a person selects between two or more options (e.g., voting behavior, choice of a punishment for another participant). 

* ''Reaction time.'' The time between the presentation of a stimulus and an appropriate response can indicate differences between two cognitive processes, and can indicate some things about their nature. For example, if in a search task the reaction times vary proportionally with the number of elements, then it is evident that this cognitive process of searching involves serial instead of parallel processing.

* ''Psychophysical responses.'' Psychophysical experiments are an old psychological technique, which has been adopted by cognitive psychology. They typically involve making judgments of some physical property, e.g. the loudness of a sound. Correlation of subjective scales between individuals can show cognitive or sensory biases as compared to actual physical measurements. Some examples include:
** sameness judgments for colors, tones, textures, etc.
** threshold differences for colors, tones, textures, etc.

* ''[[Eye tracking]].'' This methodology is used to study a variety of cognitive processes, most notably visual perception and language processing. The fixation point of the eyes is linked to an individual's focus of attention. Thus, by monitoring eye movements, we can study what information is being processed at a given time. Eye tracking allows us to study cognitive processes on extremely short time scales. Eye movements reflect online decision making during a task, and they provide us with some insight into the ways in which those decisions may be processed.

===Brain imaging===
{{Main|Neuroimaging}}

[[Image:Hypothalamus.jpg|thumb|150px||Image of the human head with the brain. The arrow indicates the position of the [[hypothalamus]].]]

Brain imaging involves analyzing activity within the brain while performing various cognitive tasks. This allows us to link behavior and brain function to help understand how information is processed. Different types of imaging techniques vary in their temporal (time-based) and spatial (location-based) resolution. Brain imaging is often used in [[cognitive neuroscience]].

* ''[[Single photon emission computed tomography]]'' and ''[[Positron emission tomography]]''. SPECT and PET use radioactive isotopes, which are injected into the subject's bloodstream and taken up by the brain. By observing which areas of the brain take up the radioactive isotope, we can see which areas of the brain are more active than other areas. PET has similar spatial resolution to fMRI, but it has extremely poor temporal resolution.

* ''[[Electroencephalography]]''. EEG measures the electrical fields generated by large populations of neurons in the cortex by placing a series of electrodes on the scalp of the subject. This technique has an extremely high temporal resolution, but a relatively poor spatial resolution.

* ''[[Functional magnetic resonance imaging]]''. fMRI measures the relative amount of oxygenated blood flowing to different parts of the brain. More oxygenated blood in a particular region is assumed to correlate with an increase in neural activity in that part of the brain. This allows us to localize particular functions within different brain regions. fMRI has moderate spatial and temporal resolution.

* ''[[Optical imaging]]''. This technique uses infrared transmitters and receivers to measure the amount of light reflectance by blood near different areas of the brain. Since oxygenated and deoxygenated blood reflects light by different amounts, we can study which areas are more active (i.e., those that have more oxygenated blood). Optical imaging has moderate temporal resolution, but poor spatial resolution. It also has the advantage that it is extremely safe and can be used to study infants' brains.

*''[[Magnetoencephalography]].'' MEG measures magnetic fields resulting from cortical activity. It is similar to [[Electroencephalography|EEG]], except that it has improved spatial resolution since the magnetic fields it measures are not as blurred or attenuated by the scalp, meninges and so forth as the electrical activity measured in EEG is. MEG uses SQUID sensors to detect tiny magnetic fields.

===Computational modeling===
[[Image:MultiLayerNeuralNetwork english.png|thumb|200px|A Neural network with two layers.]]

[[computer model|Computational models]] require a mathematically and logically formal representation of a problem. Computer models are used in the simulation and experimental verification of different specific and general [[property|properties]] of [[intelligence]].  Computational modeling can help us to understand the functional organization of a particular cognitive phenomenon.
There are two basic approaches to cognitive modeling. The first is focused on abstract mental functions of an intelligent mind and operates using symbols, and the second, which follows the neural and associative properties of the human brain, and is called subsymbolic.

* ''Symbolic modeling'' evolved from the computer science paradigms using the technologies of [[Knowledge-based systems]], as well as a philosophical perspective, see for example &quot;Good Old-Fashioned Artificial Intelligence&quot; ([[GOFAI]]). They are developed by the first cognitive researchers and later used in [[information engineering]] for [[expert system]]s . Since the early 1990s it was generalized in [[systemics]] for the investigation of functional human-like intelligence models, such as [[personoid]]s, and, in parallel, developed as the [[Soar (cognitive architecture)|SOAR]] environment. Recently, especially in the context of cognitive decision making, symbolic cognitive modeling is extended to [[socio-cognitive]] approach including social and organization cognition interrelated with a sub-symbolic not conscious layer.
* ''Subsymbolic modeling'' includes ''[[Connectionism|Connectionist/neural network models]].'' Connectionism relies on the idea that the mind/brain is composed of simple nodes and that the power of the system comes primarily from the existence and manner of connections between the simple nodes. [[Neural nets]] are textbook implementations of this approach. Some critics of this approach feel that while these models approach biological reality as a representation of how the system works, they lack explanatory powers because complicated systems of connections with even simple rules are extremely complex and often less interpretable than the system they model.

Other approaches gaining in popularity include the use of [[Dynamical systems]] theory and also techniques putting symbolic models and connectionist models into correspondence (Neural-symbolic integration). [[Bayesian cognitive science|Bayesian models]], often drawn from [[machine learning]], are also gaining popularity.

All the above approaches tend to be generalized to the form of integrated computational models of a synthetic/abstract intelligence, in order to be applied to the explanation and improvement of individual and social/organizational [[decision-making]] and [[Psychology of reasoning|reasoning]].

===Neurobiological methods===
Research methods borrowed directly from [[neuroscience]] and [[neuropsychology]] can also help us to understand aspects of intelligence. These methods allow us to understand how intelligent behavior is implemented in a physical system.

* [[Single-cell recording]]
* [[Transcranial direct current stimulation|Direct brain stimulation]]
* [[Animal models]]
* [[Postmortem studies]]

==Key findings==
Cognitive science has much to its credit. Among other accomplishments, it has given rise to models of human [[cognitive bias]] and [[risk]] perception, and has been influential in the development of [[behavioral finance]], part of [[economics]].  It has also given rise to a new theory of the [[philosophy of mathematics]], and many theories of [[artificial intelligence]], [[persuasion]] and [[coercion]]. It has made its presence firmly known in the [[philosophy of language]] and [[epistemology]] - a modern revival of rationalism - as well as constituting a substantial wing of modern [[linguistics]]. Fields of cognitive science have been influential in understanding the brain's particular functional systems (and functional deficits) ranging from speech production to auditory processing and visual perception. It has made progress in understanding how damage to particular areas of the brain affect cognition, and it has helped to uncover the root causes and results of specific disfunction, such as [[dyslexia]], [[anopia]], and [[hemispatial neglect]].

==Criticism==
{{See also|Functionalism (philosophy of mind)#Criticism}}
In a paper written shortly before his death, [[B.F. Skinner]] stated that &quot;cognitive science is the [[creationism|creation science]] of [[psychology]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;B. F. Skinner, &quot;Can Psychology be a Science of Mind?&quot;, ''American Psychologist'', November 1990, page 1209, [http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/amp/45/11/1206.html At the APA Web Site] Successfully accessed 29 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable researchers==
{{See also|List of cognitive scientists}}

Some of the more recognized names in cognitive science are usually either the most controversial or the most cited. Within philosophy familiar names include [[Daniel Dennett]] who writes from a computational systems perspective, [[John Searle]] known for his controversial [[Chinese Room]], Jerry Fodor who advocates [[Functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism]], and [[Douglas Hofstadter]], famous for writing ''[[Gödel, Escher, Bach]]'', which questions the nature of words and thought. In the realm of linguistics, [[Noam Chomsky]] and [[George Lakoff]] have been influential (both have also become notable as political commentators). In [[Artificial intelligence]] [[Marvin Minsky]], [[Herbert Simon]], [[Allen Newell]], and [[Kevin Warwick]] are prominent. Popular names in the discipline of psychology include [[James McClelland (psychologist)|James McClelland]] and [[Steven Pinker]]. Anthropologists [[Dan Sperber]], [[Edwin Hutchins]], [[Scott Atran]],  [[Pascal Boyer]] and [[Joseph Henrich]] have been involved in collaborative projects with cognitive and social psychologists, political scientists and evolutionary biologists in attempts to develop general theories of culture formation, religion and political association.

The academic field of cognitive science in its own right is very recently established.  The [[University of California, San Diego]] was the first university in the world to establish a cognitive science department. [[UCSD]]'s Department continues to be a pioneer in the field of Cognitive Science, with notable researchers such as Jeff Elman, Jim Hollan, [[Edwin Hutchins]], Terry L. Jernigan, David Kirsh, [[Marta Kutas]], [[Jean M. Mandler]], Ayse P. Saygin, Douglas A Nitz, Rafael Núñez, Jaime Pineda, and many others. The first Ph.D. in cognitive science was awarded to Agneta Gulz of [[Lund University]] in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.linguistlist.org/issues/19/19-2813.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cogsci.ucsd.edu/index.php?cat=about&amp;page=overview&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lucs.lu.se/Agneta.Gulz/&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[linguistics]], a '''copula''' (plural: '''copulae''') is a word used to link the [[subject (grammar)|subject]] of a [[sentence (linguistics)|sentence]] with a [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]] (a [[Complement (linguistics)#Subject complements|subject complement]]). The word ''copula'' derives from the [[Latin]] [[noun]] for a ''link'' or ''tie'' that connects two different things.&lt;ref&gt;See the appendix to Moro 1997 and the references cited there for a short history of the copula.&lt;/ref&gt;

A copula is often a [[verb]] or a verb-like word, though this is not universally the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Pustet |first=Regina |title=Copulas: Universals in the Categorization of the Lexicon |series=Oxford studies in typology and linguistic theory |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2005 |isbn=0199281807}}&lt;/ref&gt; A verb that is a copula is sometimes called a '''copulative''' or '''copular verb'''.  In English [[primary education]] [[grammar]] courses, a copula is often called a '''linking verb'''. Other copulae show more resemblances to [[pronoun]]s. This is the case for [[Chinese language|Chinese]] and [[Guarani language|Guarani]], for instance. In highly [[synthetic language]]s, copulae are often [[suffix]]es attached to a noun that may still behave otherwise like ordinary verbs, for example ''-u-'' in [[Eskimo languages]]. In some other languages, such as [[Beja language|Beja]] and [[Ket language|Ket]], the copula takes the form of suffixes that attach to a noun but are distinct from the [[grammatical conjugation|person agreement markers]] used on [[predicative verb]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Stassen |first=Leon |year=1997 |title=Intransitive Predication |series=Oxford studies in typology and linguistic theory |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=39 |isbn=0199258932}}&lt;/ref&gt; This phenomenon is known as ''[[nonverbal person agreement]]'' or ''[[nonverbal subject agreement]]'' and the relevant markers are always established as deriving from [[clitic]]ised independent pronouns.

In general, the term ''copula'' is used to refer to the main copular verb(s) in a language. In the case of English, this is the verb ''to be''. The term can also be used to refer to some other verbs in the language that fulfill similar functions. Other English copulae include ''to become'', ''to get'', ''to feel'', and ''to seem''.  Other verbs can have secondary uses as copulative verbs. In the following example, the past tense of the verb ''to fall'' is used as a copula: &quot;The zebra ''fell'' victim to the lion.&quot; These extra copulae are sometimes called &quot;semi-copulae&quot; or &quot;pseudo-copulae&quot;.

Most languages have one main copula, but some languages, like [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Thai language|Thai]], have more than one, and some have none.

==English==
Copulae have multiple uses.

===Use===
Several uses of the copula can be categorized:
*Identity: &quot;I only want ''to be'' myself.&quot; &quot;When the area behind the dam fills, it ''will be'' a lake.&quot; &quot;The Morning Star ''is'' the Evening Star.&quot; &quot;Boys ''will be'' boys.&quot;
 
*Class membership. To belong to a set or class: &quot;She could ''be'' married.&quot; &quot;Dogs ''are'' canines.&quot; &quot;Moscow ''is'' a large city.&quot; Depending on one's point of view, all other uses can be considered derivatives of this use, including the following non-copular uses in English, as they all express a [[subset]] relationship.

*Predication (property and relation attribution): &quot;It hurts to ''be'' blue.&quot; &quot;Will that house ''be'' big enough?&quot; &quot;The hen ''is'' next to the cockerel.&quot; &quot;I ''am'' confused.&quot; Such attributes may also relate to temporary conditions as well as inherent qualities: &quot;I will ''be'' tired after running.&quot; &quot;Will you ''be'' going to the play tomorrow?&quot; but please note that a linking verb has nothing to do with these so called &quot;Be&quot;- verbs.(see below)

===Non-copular uses===
*As an [[auxiliary verb]]:
**To form the passive voice: &quot;I ''was told'' that you wanted to see me&quot;
**To form progressive tenses in English: &quot;It ''is raining''&quot;
*Meaning &quot;to exist&quot; (existential verb): &quot;I want only to ''be'', and that is enough.&quot; &quot;There's no sense in making a scientific inquiry about what species the Loch Ness Monster is, without first establishing that the Loch Ness Monster indeed ''is.''&quot; &quot;To be or not to be, that is the question.&quot; &quot;I think therefore I am.&quot;
The auxiliary verb function derives from the copular function; and, depending on one's point of view, one can still interpret the verb as a copula and the following verbal form as being adjectival. [[Abelard]] in his Dialectica made an argument against the idea that the copula can express existence based on a ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Kneale - Kneale 1962 and Moro 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unified theory of copular sentences===
Along with canonical copular constructions wherein the canonical order of predication is displayed - that is, the [[Subject (grammar)|subject]] precedes the [[Predicate (grammar)|predicate]] - as in &quot;a picture of the wall is the cause of the riot,&quot; there can also be a symmetric type wherein the order of the two [[noun phrases]] is mirrored as in &quot;the cause of the riot is a picture of the wall&quot; (cf. Everaert et al. 2006). Although these two sentences are superficially very similar, it can be shown that they embody very different properties. So, for example, it is possible to form a sentence like &quot;which riot do you think that a picture of the wall is the cause of&quot; but not &quot;*which wall do you think that the cause of the riot was a picture of&quot;. The distinction between these two types of sentences, in the technical sense referred to as &quot;canonical&quot; vs. [[inverse copula]]r sentences, respectively - and the unified theory of copular sentences associated to it - has been proven to be valid across-languages and has led to some refinement of the theory of clause structure. In particular, it challenges one of the major dogmas of the theory of clause structure, i.e., that the two basic constituents of a sentence Noun Phrase and Verb Phrase are associated to the logical/grammatical functions of subject and predicate (cf. [[phrase structure rules]] and [[sentence (linguistics)]]).

In fact, copular sentences show that this axiom is not adequate on empirical grounds, since the [[Noun Phrase]] that cooccurs with the [[Verb Phrase]] in a copular sentence can be the predicate and the subject be contained in the Verb Phrase. It has been suggested that inverse copular sentences appear to play a sharp role in setting the [[pro-drop]] parameter. In Italian, for example, in sentences of the type Noun Phrase verb Noun Phrase, the verb, in general, agrees with the Noun Phrase on the left with one exception: inverse copular sentences. One can construe minimal pairs like ''the cause of the riot is/*are these pictures of the wall'' vs. ''la causa della rivolta sono/*è queste foto del muro'': The two sentences are one the gloss of the other with only one difference: The copula is singular in Italian and plural in English. If one does not want to give up the idea that agreement is on the left, then the only option is to assume that pro occurs between the copula and the Noun Phrase on the left. That pro can occur as a predicate must be in fact independently assumed to assign a proper structure to sentences like ''sono io'' (am I: &quot;it's me&quot;), which can by no means be considered a transformation of *''io sono'', which has no meaning.

===Copula omission===
In informal speech of English, the copula may be dropped. This is a feature of [[African American Vernacular English]] but is also used by a variety of English speakers in informal contexts.&lt;ref&gt;Bender, Emily (2000) Syntactic Variation and Linguistic Competence: The Case of AAVE Copula Absence. Ph.D. Dissertation, Stanford University&lt;/ref&gt; An example: &quot;Where you at? We at the store.&quot;

===Double copula===
The [[double copula]] is the use of two successive copulae when only one is necessary. Use of the double copula is one of the [[disputes in English grammar]].

===Conjugation===
As in most [[Indo-European language]]s, the English copula is the most irregular verb because of constant use. Most English verbs (traditionally known as &quot;[[Weak inflection|weak verbs]]&quot;) have just four separate forms, e.g., &quot;start&quot;, &quot;starts&quot;, &quot;starting&quot;, &quot;started&quot;. A sizable minority (traditionally known as &quot;[[Strong inflection|strong verbs]]&quot;) have five separate forms, e.g., &quot;begin&quot;, &quot;begins&quot;, &quot;beginning&quot;, &quot;began&quot;, &quot;begun&quot;. &quot;To be&quot; is a very special case in having eight forms: &quot;be&quot;, &quot;am&quot;, &quot;is&quot;, &quot;are&quot;, &quot;being&quot;, &quot;was&quot;, &quot;were&quot;, &quot;been&quot;. At one time, it had even more, including &quot;art&quot;, &quot;wast&quot;, &quot;wert&quot;, and, on occasion, &quot;beest&quot; as a [[subjunctive]].

===Subset relator===
From one perspective, the copula always relates two things as subsets. Take the following examples:
#''John is a doctor.''
#''John and Mary are doctors.''
#''Doctors are educated.''
#''Mary is running.''
#''Running is fun.''

Example 1 includes John in the set of all doctors. Example 2 includes John and Mary both in the set of all doctors. Example 3 includes the set of doctors in the set of those who are educated.

Example 4 is different. Example 4 includes Mary's [[Stative verb|state]] at the time of utterance in the [[Dynamic verb|set of states consistent with running]]. Example 5 then includes the set of states consistent with running in the set of states consistent with fun.

===Distinguishing between a copula and an action verb===
A copula and an [[action verb]] can generally be differentiated by trying to substitute the verb with a form of &quot;to seem&quot; or &quot;to be&quot;.

* ''Example of an Action Verb'': Sam '''looks''' at lettuce. Sam '''seems''' at lettuce? Sam '''is''' at lettuce? The latter two don't make sense, so &quot;looks&quot; in this case is being used as an action verb.

* ''Example of a Copula'': Sam '''looks''' happy. Sam '''seems''' happy? Sam '''is''' happy? The latter two make sense; &quot;looks&quot; is used as a copula in this case.

Note that this approach falters, in part, with the verb &quot;to appear&quot;. In the sentence &quot;Sam appears to be happy&quot;, &quot;appears&quot; is a copula. Yet, &quot;seems&quot; but not &quot;is&quot; can be substituted: &quot;Sam is to be happy&quot; means something else entirely.

==Copulae in other languages==
In [[Indo-European language]]s, the words meaning &quot;to be&quot; often sound similar to each other. Due to the high frequency of their use, their inflection retains a considerable degree of similarity in some cases. Thus, for example, the English form ''is'' is an apparent [[cognate]] of German ''ist'', Latin ''est'' and Russian ''&lt;nowiki&gt;jest'&lt;/nowiki&gt;'', even though the Germanic, Italic, and Slavic language groups split at least three thousand years ago. The origins of the [[Indo-European copula]]e can be traced back to four different stems ''*es-'' (''*h&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;es-''), ''*sta-'' (''*steh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-''), ''*wes-'' and ''*bhu-'' (''*bʰuH-'') in most Indo-European languages.

===Georgian and English===
As in English, the verb &quot;to be&quot; (''qopna'') is irregular in [[Georgian language|Georgian]] (a [[South Caucasian languages|Kartvelian language]]); different verb roots are employed in different tenses. The roots -''ar''-, -''kn''-, -''qav''-, and -''qop''- (past participle) are used in the present tense, future tense, past tense and the perfective tenses respectively. Examples:

:{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;2&quot; cellpadding=&quot;1&quot;
| align=left |  || align=right |  || align=left | 
|-
| ''Masc'avlebeli v''ar.
| &quot;I ''am'' a teacher.&quot;
|-
| ''Masc'avlebeli vi''kn''ebi''.
| &quot;I ''will be'' a teacher.&quot;
|-
| ''Masc'avlebeli vi''qav''i''.
| &quot;I ''was'' a teacher.&quot;
|-
| ''Masc'avlebeli v''qop''ilv''ar.
| &quot;I ''have been'' a teacher.&quot;
|-
| ''Masc'avlebeli v''qop''ili''qav''i''.
| &quot;I ''had been'' a teacher.&quot;
|}

Note that, in the last two examples (perfect and pluperfect), two roots are used in one verb compound. In the perfective tense, the root ''qop'' (which is the expected root for the perfective tense) is followed by the root ''ar'', which is the root for the present tense. In the pluperfective tense, again, the root ''qop'' is followed by the past tense root ''qav''. This formation is very similar to [[German language|German]] (an [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European language]]), where the perfective and the pluperfective are expressed in the following way:

:{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;2&quot; cellpadding=&quot;1&quot;
| align=left |  || align=right |  || align=left | 
|-
| ''Ich'' bin ''Lehrer'' gewesen.
| &quot;I have been a teacher&quot;, literally &quot;I ''am'' teacher ''been''.&quot;
|-
| ''Ich'' war ''Lehrer'' gewesen.
| &quot;I had been a teacher&quot;, literally &quot;I ''was'' teacher ''been''.&quot;
|}

Here, ''gewesen'' is the past participle of ''sein'' (&quot;to be&quot;) in German. In both examples, as in Georgian, this participle is used together with the present and the past forms of the verb in order to conjugate for the perfect and the pluperfect aspects.

===Zero copula (Semitic languages, Quechuan languages, Hungarian, Russian, Ancient Greek)===
{{main|Zero copula}}
In some languages, copula omission occurs within a particular grammatical context. For example, speakers of [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], and [[Quechuan languages]] consistently drop the copula in present tense: Russian: я&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; человек, ''ya&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; chelovek'' &quot;I (am) a human&quot;; Hungarian: ''ő ember'', &quot;he (is) a human&quot;; Hebrew: ''אני בן-אדם'' &quot;I (am a) human&quot;, Arabic: أنا إنسان ''ʔænæː insæːn'' &quot;I am human&quot;; Southern Quechua: ''payqa runam'' &quot;s/he (is) a human&quot;.  This usage is known generically as the zero copula. Note that in other tenses (sometimes in other persons besides third singular) the copula usually reappears.

In Ancient Greek, when an adjective precedes a noun with an article, the copula is understood.  Thus, ὁ οἴκος ἐστὶ μακρός, &quot;the house is large,&quot; can be written μακρός ὁ οἴκος, &quot;large the house (is).&quot;

In Quechua —[[Southern Quechua]] used for the examples—, zero copula is restricted to present tense in third person singular only (''kan''): ''Payqa runam'' &amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; &quot;(s)he is a human&quot;; but: ''(paykuna) runakunam kanku'' &quot;(they) are human&quot;.

In Hungarian, zero copula is restricted to present tense in third person singular and plural: ''Ő ember''/''Ők emberek''&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; &quot;s/he is a human&quot;/&quot;they are humans&quot;; but: ''(én) ember vagyok'' &quot;I am a human&quot;, ''(te) ember vagy'' &quot;you are a human&quot;, ''mi emberek vagyunk'' &quot;we are humans&quot;, ''(ti) emberek vagytok'' &quot;you (all) are humans&quot;. The copula also reappears for stating locations: ''az emberek a házban vannak'', &quot;the people are in the house,&quot; and for stating time: ''hat óra van'', &quot;it is six o'clock.&quot; However, the copula may optionally get omitted in colloquial language: ''hat óra (van),'' &quot;it is six o'clock.&quot;

Hungarian uses a copula to say ''Itt van Róbert'' &quot;Bob is here&quot; (and this not only with regard to third person singular/plural), but not to say ''Róbert öreg'' &quot;Bob is old&quot;. This is to relate a subject to a more temporary condition/state taking place in ''space'' (very often in the sense of [[Lojban]] ''zvati'': ''la rabyrt. zvati ne'i le zdani'' &quot;Robert is in the house&quot;).

Further restrictions may apply before omission is permitted. For example, in the [[Irish language]], ''is'', the present tense of the copula, may be omitted when the [[Predicate (grammar)|predicate]] is a noun. ''Ba'' the past/conditional cannot be deleted. If the present copula is omitted, the following pronoun ''é, í, iad'' preceding the noun is omitted as well.

===Essence versus state===
[[Romance copula]]e usually consist of two different verbs that can be translated as &quot;to be&quot;, the main one from the [[Latin]] ''esse'' (derived from ''*es-''), and a secondary one from ''stare'' (derived from ''*sta-'') . This is found in Spanish, Catalan, Portuguese, and to a lesser extent Italian.  The difference is that the first usually refers to essential characteristics, while the second refers to states and situations, e.g., &quot;Bob is old&quot; versus &quot;Bob is well&quot;. A similar division is found in the non-Romance Basque language (viz. ''egon'' and ''izan''). (Note that the English words just used, &quot;essential&quot; and &quot;state&quot;, are also cognate with the Latin infinitives ''esse'' and ''stare''.) In Spanish, the high degree of verbal [[inflection]], plus the existence of two copulae (''ser'' and ''estar''), means that there are 105 separate forms to express the eight in English, and the one in Chinese.

| ''Bob'' sta ''bene''. || ''Bob'' está ''bien''. || &quot;Bob is well.&quot;
|}

In some cases, the verb itself changes the meaning of the adjective/sentence. The following examples are from Portuguese:

|- align=left
! align=left | ''Sto''-derived
| ''O Bob'' está ''bom''. || &quot;Bob is feeling good.&quot; || ''O Bob'' está ''parvo''. || &quot;Bob is acting/being silly.&quot;
|}

In certain languages, not only are there two copulae but the [[syntax]] is also changed when one is distinguishing between states or situation and essential characteristics. For example, in Irish and Scottish Gaelic, describing the subject's state or situation typically uses the normal [[Verb Subject Object|VSO ordering]] with the verb ''bí''. The copula ''is'', which is used to state essential characteristics or equivalences, requires a change in word order so that the subject does not immediately follow the copula (see [[Irish syntax]]).

In [[Slavic language]]s, a similar distinction is made by putting a state in the [[instrumental case]], while characteristics are in the [[nominative case|nominative]]. This is used with all the copulae (e.g., &quot;become&quot; is normally used with the instrumental). It also allows the distinction to be made when the copula is omitted (zero copula) in East Slavic languages (in other Slavic languages the copula is not omitted).

===Irish===
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2010}}
In Irish, the copula is used for things that are in a permanent state. 

:{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;2&quot; cellpadding=&quot;1&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot;
| align=left valign=top|  || align=right valign=top |  || align=left valign=top | 
|- 
|''Is fear Liam''|| &quot;Liam is a man&quot; ||(lit., is man Liam)
|- 
|''Is leabhar &amp;eacute; sin''|| &quot;That is a book&quot; ||(lit., is book it that) 

|}

The word &quot;is&quot; is the copula (rhymes with the English word &quot;hiss&quot;).  
The pronoun used with the copula is different from the normal pronoune.  For a masculine singular noun, &quot;&amp;eacute;&quot; is used (for &quot;he&quot; or &quot;it&quot;), as opposed to the normal pronoun &quot;s&amp;eacute;&quot;; for a feminine singular noun, &quot;&amp;iacute;&quot; is used (for &quot;she&quot; or &quot;it&quot;), as opposed to normal pronoun &quot;s&amp;iacute;&quot;; for plural nouns, &quot;iad&quot; is used (for &quot;they&quot; or &quot;those&quot;), as opposed to the normal pronoun &quot;siad&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Myles Dillon and Donncha &amp;oacute; Cr&amp;oacute;in&amp;iacute;n, Irish, Teach Yourself Books, Saint Paul's House, Warwick Lane London EC4. Lesson VIII, &quot;The Copula&quot;, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;

To describe non-permanent states, &quot;to be&quot; is used, e.g., ''Tá mé ag rith'' &quot;I am running&quot;

This system resembles the [[Copula_(linguistics)#Essence_versus_state|Essence versus state]] distinction of the Romance copula

===Haitian Creole===
[[Haitian Creole language|Haitian Creole]], a [[French-based creole language]], has a reputation as being rather exotic from a linguistic standpoint when compared to French and the other Romance languages; and it lives up to this reputation with its copula system.  It has three forms of the copula: ''se'', ''ye'', and the [[zero copula]], no word at all (the position of which will be indicated with ''Ø'', just for purposes of illustration).

Although no textual record exists of Haitian at its earliest stages of development from French, ''se'' is derived from French ''c'est'' ({{IPA-fr|se|}}), which is the normal French contraction of ''ce'' (that) and the copula ''est'' (third-person singular of the present indicative of the verb ''être'', ultimately from Latin ''sum''). As Latin ''sto''  became ''ester'' in Old French and ''sum'' became ''estre'', these two verbs merged into modern ''être'' before the colonization of Haiti and therefore ''sto'' does not appear in Haitian Creole.

The derivation of ''ye'' is less obvious; but we can assume that the French source was ''il est'' (&quot;he/it is&quot;), which, in rapidly spoken French, is very commonly pronounced as ''y est'' (IPA {{IPA|[je]}}).

The use of a zero copula is unknown in French, and it is thought to be an innovation from the early days when Haitian was first developing as a Romance-based [[pidgin]].  Latin also sometimes used a zero copula.

Which of ''se''/''ye''/''Ø'' is used in any given copula clause depends on complex syntactic factors that we can superficially summarize in the following four rules:

1. Use ''Ø'' (i.e., no word at all) in declarative sentences where the complement is an adjective phrase, prepositional phrase, or adverb phrase:

:{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;2&quot; cellpadding=&quot;1&quot;
| align=left |  || align=right |  || align=left | 
|-
| ''Li te Ø an Ayiti.''
| &quot;She was in Haiti.&quot; || (she ''past-tense'' in Haiti)
|-
| ''Liv-la Ø jon.''
| &quot;The book is yellow.&quot; || (book-the yellow)
|-
| ''Timoun-yo Ø lakay.''
| &quot;The kids are [at] home.&quot; || (kids-the home)
|}

2. Use ''se'' when the complement is a noun phrase.  But note that, whereas other verbs come ''after'' any tense/mood/aspect particles (like ''pa'' to mark negation, or ''te'' to explicitly mark past tense, or ''ap'' to mark progressive aspect), ''se'' comes ''before'' any such particles:

:{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;2&quot; cellpadding=&quot;1&quot;
| align=left |  || align=right |  || align=left | 
|-
| ''Chal se ekriven.''
| &quot;Charles is writer.&quot;
|-
| ''Chal se pa ekriven.''
| &quot;Charles is not writer.&quot; cf. with the verb ''kouri'' (&quot;run&quot;): ''Chal pa kouri'', not ''Chal kouri pa.''
|-
| ''Chal, ki se ekriven, pa vini.''
| &quot;Charles, who is writer, not come.&quot;
|}

3. Use ''se'' where French and English have a [[dummy pronoun|dummy &quot;it&quot;]] subject:

:{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;2&quot; cellpadding=&quot;1&quot;
| align=left |  || align=right |  || align=left | 
|-
| ''Se mwen!''
| &quot;It's me!&quot; French ''C'est moi!''
|-
| ''Se pa fasil.''
| &quot;It's not easy,&quot; colloquial French ''C'est pas facile.''
|}

4. Finally, use the other copula form ''ye'' in situations where the sentence's syntax leaves the copula at the end of a phrase:

:{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;2&quot; cellpadding=&quot;1&quot;
| align=left |  || align=right |  || align=left | 
|-
| ''Kijan ou ye?''
| &quot;How you are?&quot;
|-
| ''Pou kimoun liv-la te ye?''
| &quot;Whose book was it?&quot; || (of who book-the ''past-tense'' is?)
|-
| ''M pa konnen kimoun li ye.''
| &quot;I don't know who he is.&quot; || (I not know who he is)
|-
| ''Se yon ekriven Chal ye.''
| &quot;Charles is a ''writer''!&quot; || (it's a writer Charles is; cf. French ''C'est un écrivain qu'il est.'')
|}

The above is, however, only a simplified analysis.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Howe90|Howe 1990]]. Source for most of the Haitian data in this article; for more details on syntactic conditions as well as Haitian-specific copula constructions, such as ''se kouri m ap kouri'' (It's run I ''progressive'' run; &quot;I'm really running!&quot;), see the grammar sketch in this publication.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Vald88|Valdman &amp; Rosemond 1988]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japanese and Korean ===
[[Japanese language|Japanese]] and [[Korean language|Korean]] have copulae that would most often be translated as one of the so-called be-verbs of English, the two languages being grammatically very similar but with entirely different vocabulary and some difference in phonetic range. 

The following is for description of the Japanese copulae, but, if simply exchanged with corresponding Korean words in Korean Hangul script, it would equally serve well for the Korean ones, except the last paragraph, which is concerned with a habit peculiar to Japanese speakers. 

The '''Japanese copula''' has many forms. The words ''da'' and ''desu'' are used to [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]] sentences, while ''na'' and ''de'' are particles used within sentences to modify or connect.

Japanese sentences with copulae most often equate one thing with another, that is, they are of the form &quot;A is B.&quot; Examples:

:{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;2&quot; cellpadding=&quot;1&quot;
| align=left |  || align=right |  || align=left | 
|-
| 私は学生だ。
| ''Watashi wa gakusei da.'' || &quot;I'm a student.&quot; || (lit., I &lt;small&gt;TOPIC&lt;/small&gt; student &lt;small&gt;COPULA&lt;/small&gt;)
|-
| これはペンです。
| ''Kore wa pen desu.'' || &quot;This is a pen.&quot; || (lit., this &lt;small&gt;TOPIC&lt;/small&gt; pen &lt;small&gt;COPULA-POLITE&lt;/small&gt;)
|}

The difference between ''da'' and ''desu'' appears simple. For instance ''desu'' is [[Honorific speech in Japanese|more formal and polite]] than ''da''. Thus, many sentences such as the ones below are almost identical in meaning and differ in the speaker's politeness to the [[addressee]] and in nuance of how assured the person is of their statement. However, ''desu'' may never come before the end of a sentence, and ''da'' is used exclusively to delineate subordinate clauses. In addition, ''da'' is always declarative, never interrogative.

:{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;2&quot; cellpadding=&quot;1&quot;
| align=left |  || align=right |  || align=left | 
|-
| あれはホテルだ。
| ''Are wa hoteru da''. || &quot;That's a hotel.&quot; || (lit., that &lt;small&gt;TOPIC&lt;/small&gt; hotel &lt;small&gt;COPULA&lt;/small&gt;)
|-
| あれはホテルです。
| ''Are wa hoteru desu''. || &quot;That is a hotel.&quot; || (lit., that &lt;small&gt;TOPIC&lt;/small&gt; hotel &lt;small&gt;COPULA-POLITE&lt;/small&gt;)
|}

Japanese sentences may be predicated with copulae or with verbs. However, ''desu'' may not always be a predicate. In some cases, its only function is to make a sentence predicated with a [[stative verb]] more polite.  However, ''da'' always functions as a predicate, so it cannot be combined with a stative verb, because sentences need only one predicate. See the examples below.

:{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;2&quot; cellpadding=&quot;1&quot;
| align=left |  || align=right |  || align=left | 
|-
| このビールはおいしい。
| ''Kono bīru wa oishii.'' || &quot;This beer is delicious.&quot; || (lit., this beer &lt;small&gt;TOPIC&lt;/small&gt; be-tasty)
|-
| このビールはおいしいです。
| ''Kono bīru wa oishii desu.'' || &quot;This beer is good.&quot; || (lit., this beer &lt;small&gt;TOPIC&lt;/small&gt; be-tasty &lt;small&gt;POLITE&lt;/small&gt;)
|-
| &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;このビールはおいしいだ。
| &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;''Kono bīru wa oishii da.'' || colspan=2 | This is unacceptable because ''da'' may only serve as a predicate.
|}

There are several theories as to the origin of ''desu''; one is that it is a shortened form of であります ''de arimasu'', which is a polite form of である ''de aru''. In general, both forms are used in only writing and more formal situations. Another form, でございます ''de gozaimasu'', which is the more formal version of ''de arimasu'', in the etymological sense a conjugation of でござる ''de gozaru'' and an honorific suffix -ます ''-masu'', is also used in some situations and is very polite. Note that ''de aru'' and ''de gozaru'' are considered to be compounds of a particle で ''de'', and existential verbs ''aru'' and ''gozaru''. です ''desu'' may be pronounced っす ''ssu'' in colloquial speech. The copula is subject to dialectal variation throughout Japan, resulting in forms such as や ''ya'' (in [[Kansai dialect|Kansai]]) and じゃ ''ja'' (in [[Hiroshima]]).

Japanese also has two verbs corresponding to English &quot;to be&quot;: ''aru'' and ''iru''. They are not copulae but existential verbs. ''Aru'' is used for inanimate objects, including plants, whereas ''iru'' is used for people and animals, though there are exceptions to this generalization.

:{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;2&quot; cellpadding=&quot;1&quot;
| align=left |  || align=right |  || align=left | 
|-
| 本はテーブルにある。
| ''Hon wa tēburu ni aru''. || &quot;The book is on a table.&quot;
|-
| キムさんはここにいる。
| ''Kimu-san wa koko ni iru''. || &quot;Kim is here.&quot;
|}

Japanese people, when learning English, usually drop the auxiliary verbs &quot;be&quot; and &quot;do&quot; due to believing incorrectly that &quot;be&quot; is a semantically empty copula equivalent to &quot;desu&quot; and &quot;da&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal = TESL Working Paper Series | title = The English Copula Be: Japanese Learners’ Confusion | author = Sayuri Kusutani | volume = 4 | issue = 2 | date = Fall 2006 | url = http://web1.hpu.edu/images/GraduateStudies/TESL_WPS/04Kusutani_Syntax_a17235.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chinese===
&lt;small&gt;N.B. The characters used are [[Simplified Chinese|simplified]] ones, and the transcriptions given in italics reflect [[Standard Chinese]] pronunciation, using the [[Pinyin]] system.&lt;/small&gt;

In [[Chinese language|Chinese]] languages, both states and qualities are, in general, expressed with [[stative verb]]s (SV) with no need for a copula, e.g., in Mandarin, &quot;to be tired&quot; (累 ''lèi''), &quot;to be hungry&quot; (饿 ''è''), &quot;to be located at&quot; (在 ''zài''), &quot;to be stupid&quot; (笨 ''bèn'') and so forth. These verbs are usually preceded by an adverb such as 很 ''hěn'' (&quot;very&quot;) or 不 ''bù'' (&quot;not&quot;). It could also simply be the pronoun and verb. e.g. 我饿。 ''wǒ è.'' &quot;I am hungry.&quot;

Only sentences with a noun as the complement (e.g., &quot;this is my sister&quot;) use the verb &quot;to be&quot;: 是 ''shì''. This is used frequently: For example, instead of having a verb meaning &quot;to be Chinese&quot;, the usual expression is &quot;to be a Chinese person&quot;, using 是 ''shì''.  Some scholars call this verb form an equative verb (EV), as published in some Yale Chinese textbooks.

The history of the Chinese copula 是 is a controversial subject.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} Before the [[Han Dynasty]], the character served as a [[demonstrative pronoun]] meaning &quot;this&quot; (this usage survives in some idioms and proverbs, as well as in Japanese). Some linguists argue that 是 developed into a copula because it often appeared, as a repetitive subject, after the subject of a sentence (in [[classical Chinese]] we can say, for example: &quot;George W. Bush, ''this'' president of the United States&quot; meaning &quot;George W. Bush ''is'' the president of the United States).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pulleyblank|first=Edwin G.|title=Outline of Classical Chinese Grammar|publisher=UBC Press|year=1995|location=Vancouver|isbn=0-7748-0541-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars do not completely accept the explanation, proposing that 是 served as a demonstrative pronoun and a copula at the same time in ancient Chinese.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} [[Etymology|Etymologically]], 是 developed from the meaning of &quot;straight&quot;; in modern Chinese, however, it can be combined with the modifier 的 ''de'' to mean &quot;yes&quot; or to show agreement.
e.g. Question: 你的汽车是不是红色的？ ''nǐ de qìchē shì bú shì hóngsè de?'' &quot;Is your car red?&quot;
Response: 是的。 ''shì de.'' &quot;Yes.&quot; (Shows positive agreement towards the question, in the sense that the responder is saying &quot;It is.&quot;)

A more common way of showing that the person asking the question is correct is by simply saying &quot;right&quot; or &quot;correct&quot;, which would be 对 ''duì'', which would drop the modifer 的 ''de''.

[[Cantonese]] uses 係 ([[Jyutping]]: hai6) instead of 是.

===Siouan languages===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Medicine man]] --&gt;
In Siouan languages like [[Lakota language|Lakota]], in principle almost all words — according to their structure — are verbs. So, not very unlike in Lojban (see below), not only (transitive, intransitive and so-called 'stative') verbs but even nouns often behave like verbs and do not need to have copulae.

For example, the word ''wičháša'' refers to a man, and the verb &quot;to-be-a-man&quot; is expressed as ''wimáčhaša/winíčhaša/wičháša'' (I am/you are/he is a man). Yet there also is a copula ''héčha'' (to be a ...) that in most cases is used: ''wičháša hemáčha/heníčha/héčha'' (I am/you are/he is a man).

In order to express the statement &quot;I am a doctor of profession,&quot; one has to say ''pezuta wičháša hemáčha''. But, in order to express that that person is THE doctor (say, that had been phoned to help), one must use another copula ''iyé'' (to be the one): ''pežúta wičháša (kiŋ) miyé yeló'' (medicine-man DEF ART I-am-the-one MALE ASSERT).

In order to refer to space (e.g., Robert is in the house), various verbs are used, e.g., ''yaŋkÁ'' (lit.: to sit) for humans, or ''háŋ/hé'' (to stand upright) for inanimate objects of a certain shape. &quot;Robert is in the house&quot; could be translated as ''Robert thimáhel yaŋké (yeló)'', whereas &quot;there's one restaurant next to the gas station&quot; translates as &quot;owótethipi wígli-oínažiŋ kiŋ hél isákhib waŋ hé&quot;.

===Constructed languages===
The [[constructed language]] [[Lojban]] has copulae, but they are rarely used, and are sometimes viewed with distaste in the Lojban community, because all words that express a predicate can be used as verbs. The three sentences &quot;Bob runs&quot;, &quot;Bob is old&quot;, and &quot;Bob is a fireman&quot;, for instance, would all have the same form in Lojban: ''la bob. bajra'', ''la bob. tolcitno'', and ''la bob. fagdirpre''. There are several different copulae: ''me'' turns whatever follows the word ''me'' into a verb that means ''to be'' what it follows. For example, ''me la bob.'' means ''to be Bob.'' Another copula is ''du'', which is a verb that means all its arguments are the same thing (equal).&lt;ref&gt;[http://ptolemy.tlg.uci.edu/~opoudjis/lojbanbrochure/lessons/less12eq.html Lojban For Beginners]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[E-Prime]] language, based on English, simply avoids the issue by not having a generic copula. It requires instead a specific form such as &quot;remains&quot;, &quot;becomes&quot;, &quot;lies&quot;, or &quot;equals&quot;.

[[Esperanto]] uses the copula much as English. The infinitive is ''esti'', and the whole conjugation is regular (as with all Esperanto verbs). In addition, adjectival roots can be turned into stative verbs: ''La ĉielo bluas.'' &quot;The sky is blue.&quot;

Likewise, [[Ido]] has a copula that works as English &quot;to be&quot;. Its infinitive is ''esar'', and, as is the case in Esperanto, all of its forms are regular: The simple present is ''esas'' for all persons; the simple past is ''esis'', the simple future is ''esos'', and the imperative is ''esez'', among a few more forms. However, Ido also has an alternative irregular form for the simple present (&quot;es&quot;), which some Idists frown upon. The possibility to turn adjectives and even nouns into verbs also exist, although this is mostly done by means of an affix, on top of the verbal endings. The affix is &quot;-es-&quot;. So, &quot;The sky is blue.&quot; can be said as &quot;La cielo bluesas&quot;. As can be seen, the suffix &quot;-es-&quot; plus the verbal desinence &quot;-as&quot; are simply the verb &quot;to be&quot; annexed to the adjectival or nominal root.

[[Interlingua]] speakers use copulae with the same freedom as speakers of Slavic, Germanic, and Romance languages. In addition to combinations with ''esser'' ('to be'), expressions such as ''cader prede'' ('to fall prey') are common. ''Esser'' is stated, rather than omitted as in Russian.

==Existential usage==
The existential usage of &quot;to be&quot; is distinct from and yet, in some languages, intimately related to its copulative usage. In language as opposed to formal logic, existence is a predicate rather than a quantifier, and the passage from copulative to existential usage can be subtle. In modern linguistics, one commonly speaks of existential constructions - prototypically involving an [[expletive]] like ''there'' - rather than existential use of the verb itself. So, for example in English, a sentence like &quot;there is a problem&quot; would be considered an instance of existential construction. Relying on unified theory of copular sentences, it has been proposed that ''there''-sentences are subtypes of inverse copular sentences (see Moro 1997 and &quot;existential sentences and expletive ''there''&quot; in Everaert et al. 2006 for a detailed discussion of this issue and a historical survey of the major proposals).

For example:
*'''Arabic''': يمكنه أنّ يبدو أنّ '''يكون''' ذكياً &amp;ndash; ''Yumkinuhu ʼan yabdu ʼan '''yakūna''' ḏakiyyan.'' &amp;mdash; He can appear (to be) smart.
*'''Japanese''': 吾輩は猫'''である'''。名前はまだ'''ない'''。 ''Wagahai wa neko '''de aru'''. Namae wa mada '''nai''''' &amp;ndash; ''[[I am a Cat|I '''am''' a cat]]. As yet, I '''have no''' name''. &amp;mdash; [[Natsume Sōseki]]
*'''English''': '''''To be''' or not '''to be''', that ''is'' the question''. &amp;mdash; [[William Shakespeare]]
*'''English''': ''[Why climb Mount Everest?] Because '''it is there'''''. &amp;mdash; [[George Mallory]]
*'''Hebrew''': [[I am that I am|אהיה אשר אהיה]] ''Ehyeh asher ehyeh.'' &amp;ndash; '''''I am''' that '''I am'''''. &amp;mdash; [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 3:14.
*'''Russian''': ''Страна, которую ищут дети, '''есть'''.'' &amp;ndash; ''Strana, kotoroju iščut deti, '''&lt;nowiki&gt;jest'&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''.'' &amp;ndash; ''The country, which children are looking for,  '''exists'''.'' &amp;mdash; [[Mikhail Prishvin]]
*'''French''': ''Je pense, donc '''je suis'''.'' &amp;ndash; ''I think; therefore, '''I am'''''. &amp;mdash; [[Descartes]]
*'''Latin''': ''[[Cogito ergo sum|Cogito ergo '''sum''']].'' &amp;ndash; ''I think; therefore, '''I am'''''. &amp;mdash; [[Descartes]]
*'''Hungarian''': ''Gondolkodom, tehát '''vagyok'''.'' &amp;ndash; ''I think; therefore, '''I am'''''. &amp;mdash; [[Descartes]]
*'''Turkish''': ''Düşünüyorum, öyleyse '''varım'''.'' &amp;ndash; ''I think; therefore, '''I am'''''. &amp;mdash; [[Descartes]]
*'''Finnish''': ''Ajattelen, siis '''olen'''.'' &amp;ndash; ''I think; therefore, '''I am'''''. &amp;mdash; [[Descartes]]
*'''Filipino/Tagalog''': ''Ang kahalagahan ng '''pagiging''' seryoso.'' &amp;ndash; ''The importance of '''being''' Earnest.'' &amp;mdash; [[Oscar Wilde]]

Other languages prefer to keep the existential usage entirely separate from the copula. Swedish, for example, reserves ''vara'' (to be) for the copula, keeping ''bli'' (to become) and ''finnas'' (to exist, lit. to be found) for becoming and existing, respectively.
*'''Swedish''': ''Vem vill '''bli''' miljonär?'' &amp;ndash; ''Who wants '''to be''' a millionaire?''. (Literally &quot;Who wants '''to become''' millionaire?&quot;) &amp;mdash; [[Bengt Magnusson]]
*'''Swedish''': ''Varför bestiga Mt. Everest? Därför att det '''finns''' där.'' &amp;ndash; ''Why climb Mt. Everest? Because it '''is''' there''. (Literally &quot;Why climb Mt. Everest? Because it '''is found''' there&quot;) &amp;mdash; [[George Mallory]]

In Spanish, ''ser'' (to be) is the copula, and ''estar'' (to be, to remain) and ''existir'' (to exist) are for being in a place and existing, respectively.
*'''Spanish''': ''Pienso, luego '''existo'''.'' &amp;ndash; ''I think; therefore, '''I am'''''. &amp;mdash; [[Descartes]]

In [[ontology]], philosophical discussions of the word &quot;be&quot; and its conjugations takes place over the meaning of the word ''is,'' the third person singular form of 'be', and whether the other senses can be [[Reduction (philosophy)|reduced]] to one sense. For example, it is sometimes suggested that the &quot;is&quot; of existence is reducible to the &quot;is&quot; of property attribution or class membership; to be, [[Aristotle]] held, is to be ''something''. Of course, the gerund form of &quot;be&quot;, ''being'', is its own (vexed) topic: see [[being]] and [[existence]].

'''Christopher Columbus''' (c. 31 October 1451 – 20 May 1506) was an [[explorer]], [[colonialist|colonizer]], and [[navigator]], born in the [[Republic of Genoa]], in northwestern [[History of Italy#Renaissance (15th to 16th c.)|Italy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EB-online&quot;&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/127070/Christopher-Columbus%20 Britannica] &quot;Christopher Columbus.&quot; Encyclopædia Britannica. 2010.

Those voyages, and his efforts to establish permanent settlements in the island of  [[Hispaniola]], initiated the process of [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish colonization]], which foreshadowed the general [[European colonization of the Americas|European colonization]] of the &quot;[[New World]].&quot;

In the context of emerging western [[imperialism]] and [[Competition (economics)|economic competition]] between European kingdoms seeking wealth though the establishment of [[trade route]]s and [[Colonialism|colonies]], Columbus's far-fetched proposal to reach the [[East Indies]] by sailing westward received the support of the Spanish crown, which saw in it a promise, however remote, of gaining the upper hand over rival powers in the contest for the lucrative [[spice trade]] with [[Asia]].  During his first voyage in 1492, instead of reaching [[Japan]] as he had intended, Columbus landed in the [[The Bahamas|Bahamas archipelago]], at a locale he named ''San Salvador''.  Over the course of three more voyages, Columbus visited the [[Greater Antilles|Greater]] and [[Lesser Antilles]], as well as the [[Caribbean Sea|Caribbean]] coast of [[Venezuela]] and [[Central America]], claiming them for the [[Spanish Empire]].

Though Columbus was not the first [[Europe]]an explorer to reach the [[Americas]], having been preceded, five centuries earlier, by the [[Norsemen|Norse]] expedition, led by [[Leif Ericson]], that established the short-lived colony of [[Vinland]] in what is now [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pc.gc.ca/lhn-nhs/nl/meadows/index_e.asp|title=Parks Canada — L'Anse aux Meadows National Historic Site of Canada|publisher=Pc.gc.ca|date=2009-04-24|accessdate=2009-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Columbus's voyages led to the first lasting European contact with America and inaugurated a period of European exploration and colonization of foreign lands that lasted for several centuries and had, therefore, an enormous impact in the historical development of the modern [[Western world]].  Columbus himself saw his accomplishments primarily in the light of the spreading of the [[Christianity|Christian religion]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EB-online&quot; /&gt; 

Never admitting that he had reached a continent previously unknown to Europeans, rather than the East Indies he had set out for, Columbus called the inhabitants of the lands he visited ''indios'' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] for &quot;[[India]]ns&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;Hoxie, Frederic E. ed.

==Early life==
&lt;!--THIS SECTION IS LARGELY BASED ON BRITANNICA AND MORISON's ''Christopher Columbus''--&gt;
{{See also|Origin theories of Christopher Columbus}}

The name ''Christopher Columbus'' is the Anglicisation of the [[Latin]] '''Christophorus Columbus'''. His name in Italian is '''Cristoforo Colombo''' and in Spanish it is '''Cristóbal Colón'''. Columbus was born between 25 August and 31 October 1451 in [[Genoa]], part of modern [[Italy|Italian Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, William D., and Carla Rahn Phillips. ''The Worlds of Christopher Columbus''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1992. Page 9.&lt;br&gt;&quot;''Even with less than a complete record, however, scholars can state with assurance that Columbus was born in the republic of Genoa in northern Italy, although perhaps not in the city itself, and that his family made a living in the wool business as weavers and merchants...The two main early biographies of Columbus have been taken as literal truth by hundreds of writers, in large part because they were written by individual closely connected to Columbus or his writings. ...Both biographies have serious shortcomings as evidence.''&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; His father was [[Domenico Colombo]], a middle-class [[wool]] [[Weaving|weaver]] who worked both in Genoa and [[Savona]] and who also owned a [[cheese]] stand at which young Christopher worked as a helper. Christopher's mother was [[Susanna Fontanarossa]]. Bartolomeo, Giovanni Pellegrino and Giacomo were his brothers. Bartolomeo worked in a [[cartography]] workshop in [[Lisbon]] for at least part of his adulthood.&lt;ref name= britannica&gt;Encyclopedia Britannica, 1993 ed., Vol. 16, pp. 605ff / Morison, ''Christopher Columbus'', 1955 ed., pp. 14ff&lt;/ref&gt;

Columbus never wrote in his native language, which is presumed to have been a [[Genoese dialect|Genoese variety of Ligurian]]. In one of his writings, Columbus claims to have gone to the sea at the age of 10. In 1470 the Columbus family moved to Savona, where Domenico took over a tavern. In the same year, Columbus was on a Genoese ship hired in the service of [[René of Anjou|René I of Anjou]] to support his attempt to conquer the [[Kingdom of Naples]]. Some modern historians have argued that Columbus was not from Genoa, but instead, from Catalonia,&lt;ref&gt;Telegraph, 14 Oct 2009, [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/spain/6326698/Christopher-Columbus-writings-prove-he-was-Spanish-claims-study.html Georgetown University team led by Professor Estelle Irizarry claims that Christopher Columbus was Catalan]&lt;/ref&gt; Portugal,&lt;ref&gt;da Silva, Manuel Luciano and Silvia Jorge da Silva, 2008. ''Christopher Columbus was Portuguese''. Express Printers, [[Fall River, Massachusetts|Fall River]]. ISBN 9781607028246.&lt;/ref&gt; or Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://explore.georgetown.edu/people/irizarry/?action=viewpublications|title=Georgetown University |publisher=Explore.georgetown.edu|date= |accessdate=2010-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; These competing hypotheses have generally been discounted by mainstream scholars.

[[Image:ColombusNotesToMarcoPolo.jpg|thumb|Columbus' notes in Latin, on the margins of his copy of ''[[The Travels of Marco Polo]]'']]
In 1473 Columbus began his apprenticeship as business agent for the important Centurione, Di Negro and [[Spinola Family|Spinola families]] of Genoa. Later he allegedly made a trip to [[Chios]], a Genoese colony in the [[Aegean Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://web.archive.org/web/20080705111026/http://www.millersville.edu/~columbus/columbus.html Christopher Columbus]&quot;. Thomas C. Tirado, Ph.D. Professor History. Millersville University.&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1476, he took part in an armed convoy sent by Genoa to carry a valuable cargo to northern Europe. He docked in [[Bristol]], England;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;It is most probable that Columbus visited Bristol, where he was introduced to English commerce with Iceland.&quot; [[Silvio Bedini|Bedini, Silvio A.]] and David Buisseret (1992). The Christopher Columbus encyclopedia, Volume 1, University of Michigan press, republished by Simon &amp; Schuster, ISBN 0-13-142670-2, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; [[Galway]], Ireland and was possibly in [[Iceland]] in 1477. In 1479 Columbus reached his brother Bartolomeo in [[Lisbon]], while continuing trading for the Centurione family. He married [[Filipa Moniz Perestrelo]], daughter of the [[Porto Santo]] governor and Portuguese nobleman of Genoese origin [[Bartolomeu Perestrello]]. In 1479 or 1480, his son [[Diego Columbus]] was born. Between 1482 and 1485 Columbus traded along the coasts of [[West Africa]], reaching the Portuguese trading post of [[Elmina]] at the Guinea coast.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/127070/Christopher-Columbus Christopher Columbus (Italian explorer)]&quot;. Encyclopædia Britannica Online.&lt;/ref&gt; Some records report that Filipa died in 1485. It is also speculated that Columbus may have simply left his first wife. In either case Columbus found a [[Mistress (lover)|mistress]] in Spain in 1487, a 20-year-old orphan named [[Beatriz Enríquez de Arana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://columbus-day.123holiday.net/christopher_columbus_2.html|title=Christopher Columbus Biography Page 2|publisher=Columbus-day.123holiday.net |date= |accessdate=2009-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Intelligent and ambitious, Columbus eventually learned [[Latin]], as well as [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[Spanish language|Castilian]], and read widely about [[astronomy]], [[geography]], and history, including the works of [[Ptolemy]], Cardinal [[Pierre d'Ailly]]'s ''Imago Mundi'', the travels of [[Marco Polo]] and Sir [[John Mandeville]], [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]]'s ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'', and [[Pope Pius II]]'s ''Historia Rerum Ubique Gestarum''. According to historian [[Edmund Morgan]],

{{quote|Columbus was not a scholarly man. Yet he studied these books, made hundreds of marginal notations in them and came out with ideas about the world that were characteristically simple and strong and sometimes wrong, the kind of ideas that the self-educated person gains from independent reading and clings to in defiance of what anyone else tries to tell him.&lt;ref name= &quot;ESMorgan&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Edmund S.|last=Morgan|title=Columbus' Confusion About the New World|journal=[[Smithsonian Magazine]]|year=2009|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/people-places/Presence-of-Mind-A-World-Too-New.html?c=y&amp;page=1#ixzz0ydVfdyrA}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Throughout his life, Columbus also showed a keen interest in the [[Bible]] and in [[Bible prophecy|biblical prophecies]], and would often quote biblical texts in his letters and logs. For example, part of the argument that he submitted to the Spanish [[Catholic Monarchs]] when he sought their support for his proposed expedition to reach the Indies by sailing west was based on his reading of the [[2 Esdras|Second Book of Esdras]] (see [http://www.biblestudytools.com/tmba/2-esdras/6-42.html 2 Esdras 6:42], which Columbus took to mean that the Earth is made of six parts of land to one of water). Towards the end of life, Columbus produced a ''[[Book of Prophecies]]'' in which his career as an explorer is interpreted in the light of [[Christian eschatology]] and of [[apocalypticism]].&lt;ref name=britannica /&gt;

==Quest for Asia==
[[Image:ColombusMap.jpg|thumb|&quot;Columbus map&quot;, drawn ca. 1490 in the [[Lisbon]] workshop of Bartolomeo and Christopher Columbus&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Marco Polo et le Livre des Merveilles&quot;, ISBN 978-2-35404-007-9 p.37&lt;/ref&gt;]]

===Background===
Under the [[hegemony]] over Asia of the [[Mongol Empire]] (the so-called ''[[Pax Mongolica]]'', or ''Mongol peace'') Europeans had long enjoyed a safe land passage, the so-called &quot;[[Silk Road]]&quot;, to China and India, which were sources of valuable goods such as [[silk]], [[spices]], and [[opium|opiates]]. With the [[fall of Constantinople]] to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]] in 1453, the land route to Asia became much more difficult and dangerous. Portuguese navigators, under the leadership of King [[John II of Portugal|John II]], sought to reach Asia by sailing around [[Africa]]. Major progress in this quest was achieved in 1488, when [[Bartolomeu Dias]] reached the [[Cape of Good Hope]], in what is now [[South Africa]]. Meanwhile, in the 1480s the Columbus brothers had developed a different plan to reach the Indies (then construed roughly as all of south and east Asia) by sailing west across the &quot;Ocean Sea&quot;, ''i.e.,'' the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]].

===Geographical considerations===
[[Washington Irving]]'s 1828 biography of Columbus popularized the idea that Columbus had difficulty obtaining support for his plan because [[Myth of the Flat Earth|Christian theologians insisted]] that the [[Flat Earth|Earth was flat]].&lt;ref name=book3&gt;{{Cite book|first=Paul F|last=Boller|title=Not So!:Popular Myths about America from Columbus to Clinton|year=1995|isbn= 9780195091861|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, most educated Westerners had understood that the Earth was [[Spherical Earth|spherical]] at least since the time of [[Aristotle]], who lived in the 4th century BC and whose works were widely studied and revered in [[Middle Ages|Medieval Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Jeffrey Burton 1991. ''[[Inventing the Flat Earth]]. Columbus and modern historians'', Praeger, New York, Westport, London 1991;&lt;br&gt;Zinn, Howard 1980. ''A People's History of the United States'', HarperCollins 2001. p.2&lt;/ref&gt; The sphericity of the Earth is also accounted for in the work of [[Ptolemy]], on which [[Geocentric model|ancient astronomy]] was largely based. Christian writers whose works clearly reflect the conviction that the Earth is spherical include Saint [[Bede]] the Venerable in his ''Reckoning of Time'', written around AD 723. In Columbus' time, the techniques of [[celestial navigation]], which use the position of the Sun and the Stars in the sky, together with the understanding that the Earth is a sphere, were beginning to be widely used by mariners.

Where Columbus did differ from the view accepted by scholars in his day was in his estimate of the westward distance from Europe to Asia. Columbus' ideas in this regard were based on three factors: his low estimate of the size of the Earth, his high estimate of the size of the [[Eurasia]]n landmass, and his belief that [[Japan]] and other inhabited islands lay far to the east of the coast of [[China]]. In all three of these issues Columbus was both wrong and at odds with the scholarly consensus of his day.

As far back as the 3rd century BC, [[Eratosthenes]] had correctly computed the circumference of the Earth by using simple geometry and studying the shadows cast by objects at two different locations: [[Alexandria]] and Syene (modern-day [[Aswan]]).&lt;ref name= &quot;Sagan 40,04147&quot;&gt;Sagan, Carl. ''Cosmos''; the mean circumference of the Earth is 40,041.47 km.&lt;/ref&gt; Eratosthenes's results were confirmed by a comparison of stellar observations at Alexandria and [[Rhodes]], carried out by [[Posidonius]] in the 1st century BC. These measurements were widely known among scholars, but confusion about the old-fashioned units of distance in which they were expressed had led, in Columbus's day, to some debate about the exact size of the Earth.

[[File:Atlantic Ocean, Toscanelli, 1474.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Paolo dal Pozzo Toscanelli|Toscanelli]]'s notions of the geography of the [[Atlantic Ocean]], which directly influenced Columbus' plans]]
From d'Ailly's ''Imago Mundi'' Columbus learned of [[Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Kathīr al-Farghānī|Alfraganus]]'s estimate that a degree of [[latitude]] (or a degree of longitude along the [[Equator]]) spanned 56 ⅔ miles, but did not realize that this was expressed in the Arabic mile (about 1,830 m) rather than the shorter [[Roman mile]] with which he was familiar (1,480 m).&lt;ref&gt;Morison ([[#CITEREFMorison1942|1942, pp.65,93]]).&lt;/ref&gt; He therefore estimated the circumference of the Earth to be about 30,200&amp;nbsp;km, whereas the correct value is 40,000&amp;nbsp;km (25,000&amp;nbsp;mi).

Furthermore, most scholars accepted [[Ptolemy]]'s estimate that [[Eurasia]] spanned 180° [[longitude]], rather than the actual 130° (to the Chinese mainland) or 150° (to Japan at the latitude of Spain). Columbus, for his part, believed the even higher estimate of [[Marinus of Tyre]], which put the longitudinal span of the Eurasian landmass at 225°, leaving only 135° of water. He also believed that Japan (which he called &quot;Cipangu&quot;, following Marco Polo) was much larger, further to the east from [[China]] (&quot;Cathay&quot;), and closer to the Equator than it is, and that there were inhabited islands even further to the east than Japan, including the mythical [[Antillia]], which he thought might lie not much further to the west than the [[Azores]]. In this he was influenced by the ideas of Florentine physician [[Paolo dal Pozzo Toscanelli]], who corresponded with Columbus before his death in 1482 and who also defended the feasibility of a westward route to Asia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Morison-Admiral&quot;&gt;[[Samuel Eliot Morison]], ''Admiral of the Ocean Sea: The Life of Christopher Columbus'', (Boston: Atlantic-Little, Brown, 1942). Reissued by the Morison Press, 2007.  ISBN 1406750271&lt;/ref&gt;

Columbus therefore estimated the distance from the [[Canary Islands]] to Japan to be about 3,000 Italian miles (3,700&amp;nbsp;km, or 2,300 statute miles), while the correct figure is 19,600&amp;nbsp;km (12,200&amp;nbsp;mi){{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}, or about 12,000&amp;nbsp;km along a [[great circle]]. No ship in the 15th century could carry enough food and fresh water for such a long voyage and the dangers involved in navigating through the uncharted ocean would have been formidable. Most European navigators reasonably concluded that a westward voyage from Europe to Asia was unfeasible. The [[Catholic Monarchs]], however, having completed [[Reconquista|an expensive war]] in the [[Iberian Peninsula]], were desperate for a competitive edge over other European countries in the quest for trade with the Indies. Columbus promised such an advantage.

===Nautical considerations===
Though Columbus was wrong about the number of degrees of longitude that separated Europe from the [[Far East]] and about the distance that each degree represented, he did possess valuable knowledge about the [[trade winds]], which would prove to be the key to his successful navigation of the Atlantic Ocean. During his first voyage in 1492, the brisk trade winds from the east, commonly called &quot;[[easterlies]]&quot;, propelled Columbus' fleet for five weeks, from the [[Canary Islands]] to [[The Bahamas]]. To return to Spain against this prevailing wind would have required several months of an arduous sailing technique, called [[Sailing#Beating or &quot;working&quot;|beating]], during which food and drinkable water would probably have been exhausted.

Instead, Columbus returned home by following the curving trade winds northeastward to the middle latitudes of the [[North Atlantic]], where he was able to catch the &quot;[[westerlies]]&quot; that blow eastward to the coast of Western Europe. There, in turn, the winds curve southward towards the Iberian Peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.columbusnavigation.com/v1a.shtml|title=The First Voyage Log|accessdate=2008-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucalgary.ca/applied_history/tutor/eurvoya/columbus.html|title=Christopher Columbus and the Spanish Empire|accessdate=2008-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://earthguide.ucsd.edu/virtualmuseum/climatechange1/08_1.shtml|title=Trade Winds and the Hadley Cell|accessdate=2008-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is unclear whether Columbus learned about the winds from his own sailing experience or if he had heard about them from others. The corresponding technique for efficient travel in the Atlantic appears to have been discovered first by the Portuguese, who referred to it as the ''[[Volta do mar]]'' (&quot;turn of the sea&quot;). Columbus' knowledge of the Atlantic wind patterns was, however, imperfect at the time of his first voyage. By sailing directly due west from the Canary Islands during [[List of Atlantic hurricane seasons|hurricane season]], skirting the so-called [[horse latitudes]] of the mid-Atlantic, Columbus risked either being becalmed or running into a [[tropical cyclone]], both of which he luckily avoided.&lt;ref name=&quot;Morison-Admiral&quot; /&gt;

===Funding campaign===
In 1485, Columbus presented his plans to [[John II of Portugal|John II]], [[King of Portugal]]. He proposed the king equip three sturdy ships and grant Columbus one year's time to sail out into the Atlantic, search for a western route to the [[Orient]], and return.

Columbus also requested he be made &quot;Great Admiral of the Ocean&quot;, appointed governor of any and all lands he discovered, and given one-tenth of all revenue from those lands.

The king submitted Columbus' proposal to his experts, who rejected it. It was their considered opinion that Columbus' estimation of a travel distance of {{convert|2400|mi|km|-1}} was, in fact, far too short.&lt;ref name=&quot;Morison-Admiral&quot;/&gt;

In 1488 Columbus appealed to the court of Portugal once again, and once again John II invited him to an audience. It also proved unsuccessful, in part because not long afterwards [[Bartolomeu Dias]] returned to Portugal following a successful rounding of the southern tip of Africa. Now that it looked like Portugal could soon have the eastern sea route to Asia under its control, King John was no longer interested in Columbus' project.

Columbus traveled from Portugal to both [[Republic of Genoa|Genoa]] and [[Republic of Venice|Venice]], but he received encouragement from neither. Previously he had his brother sound out [[Henry VII of England]], to see if the [[English monarch]] might not be more amenable to Columbus's proposal. After much carefully considered hesitation, Henry's invitation came too late. Columbus had already committed himself to Spain.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

He had sought an audience from the monarchs [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|Ferdinand II]] of [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]] and [[Isabella I of Castile]], who had united many kingdoms in the Iberian Peninsula by marrying, and were ruling together. On 1 May 1486, permission having been granted, Columbus presented his plans to Queen Isabella, who, in turn, referred it to a committee. After the passing of much time, the [[expert|savants]] of Spain, like their counterparts in [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]], reported back that Columbus had judged the distance to [[Asia]] much too short. They pronounced the idea impractical, and advised their Royal Highnesses to pass on the proposed venture.

However, to keep Columbus from taking his ideas elsewhere, and perhaps to keep their options open, the [[Catholic Monarchs]] gave him an annual allowance of 12,000 ''[[maravedis]]'' and in 1489 furnished him with a letter ordering all cities and towns under their domain to provide him food and lodging at no cost.&lt;ref&gt;Durant, Will ''The Story of Civilization'' vol. vi, &quot;The Reformation&quot;.

U.S. stamps reflecting the most commonly held view as to what Columbus' first fleet might have looked like. The ''[[Santa Maria (ship)|Santa Maria]]'', the flagship of Columbus' fleet, was a [[carrack]]—a merchant ship of between 400 and 600 tons, {{convert|75|ft|m}} long, with a beam of {{convert|25|ft|m}}, allowing it to carry more people and cargo. It had a deep draft of {{convert|6|ft|m}}. The vessel had three masts: a mainmast, a foremast, and a mizzenmast. Five sails altogether were attached to these masts. Each mast carried one large sail. The foresail and mainsail were square; the sail on the mizzen was a triangular sail known as a lateen mizzen. The ship had a smaller topsail on the mainmast above the mainsail and on the foremast above the foresail. In addition, the ship carried a small square sail, a [[spritsail (square-rigged)|spritsail]], on the [[bowsprit]].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elizabethan-era.org.uk/christopher-columbus-ships.htm|title=Christopher Columbus Ships|publisher= Elizabethan-era.org.uk|date= |accessdate=2010-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.evgschool.org/Columbus%27s%20Sailing%20Ships.htm|title=Columbus's Sailing Ships|publisher=Evgschool.org|date= |accessdate=2010-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

After continually lobbying at the Spanish court and two years of negotiations, he finally had success in 1492. Ferdinand and Isabella had just conquered [[Granada]], the last [[Al-Andalus|Muslim stronghold]] on the Iberian Peninsula, and they received Columbus in [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]], in the ''[[Alcázar de los Reyes Cristianos|Alcázar]]'' castle. Isabella turned Columbus down on the advice of her [[confessor]], and he was leaving town by mule in despair, when Ferdinand intervened. Isabella then sent a royal guard to fetch him and Ferdinand later claimed credit for being &quot;the principal cause why those islands were discovered&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Phillips|first1=William D.|last2=Phillips|first2=Carla Rahn|title=The Worlds of Christopher Columbus|year= 1993|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0521446525|page=132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About half of the financing was to come from private Italian investors, whom Columbus had already lined up. Financially broke after the Granada campaign, the monarchs left it to the royal treasurer to shift funds among various royal accounts on behalf of the enterprise. Columbus was to be made &quot;Admiral of the Seas&quot; and would receive a portion of all profits. The terms were unusually generous, but as his son later wrote,{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} the monarchs did not really expect him to return.

According to the contract that Columbus made with King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella, if Columbus discovered any new islands or mainland, he would receive many high rewards. In terms of power, he would be given the rank of Admiral of the Ocean Sea and appointed Viceroy and Governor of all the new lands. He had the right to nominate three persons, from whom the sovereigns would choose one, for any office in the new lands. He would be entitled to 10% of all the revenues from the new lands in perpetuity; this part was denied to him in the contract, although it was one of his demands. Additionally, he would also have the option of buying one-eighth interest in any commercial venture with the new lands and receive one-eighth of the profits.&lt;ref name=&quot;Morison-Admiral&quot;&gt;[[Samuel Eliot Morison]], ''Admiral of the Ocean Sea: The Life of Christopher Columbus'', (Boston: Atlantic-Little, Brown, 1942) p. 105.

Columbus was later arrested in 1500 and supplanted from these posts. After his death, his sons Diego and Fernando took legal action to enforce their father's contract. Many of the smears against Columbus were initiated by the [[Crown of Castile|Castilian crown]] during these lengthy court cases, known as the ''[[pleitos colombinos]]''. The family had some success in their first litigation, as a judgment of 1511 confirmed Diego's position as Viceroy, but reduced his powers. Diego resumed litigation in 1512, which lasted until 1536, and further disputes continued until 1790.&lt;ref&gt;Mark McDonald, &quot;Ferdinand Columbus, Renaissance Collector (1488-1539)&quot;, 2005, British Museum Press, ISBN 978-0-7141-2644-9&lt;/ref&gt;

==Voyages==
{{Main|Voyages of Christopher Columbus}}
[[Image:Viajes de colon en.svg|thumb|300px|Voyages of Christopher Columbus]]
Between 1492 and 1503, Columbus completed four round-trip voyages between Spain and the Americas, all of them under the sponsorship of the [[Crown of Castile]]. These voyages marked the beginning of the [[European ethnic groups|European]] [[Age of Discovery|exploration]] and [[History of colonialism|colonization]] of [[Americas|the American continents]], and are thus of enormous significance in [[Western history]]. Columbus himself always insisted, in the face of mounting evidence to the contrary, that the lands that he visited during those voyages were part of the [[Asia]]n continent, as previously described by [[Marco Polo]] and other European travelers.&lt;ref name=britannica /&gt; Columbus' refusal to accept that the lands he had visited and claimed for Spain were not part of Asia might explain, in part, why the American continent was named after the [[Florence|Florentine]] explorer [[Amerigo Vespucci]] and not after Columbus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umc.sunysb.edu/surgery/america.html|title=The Naming of America|publisher=Umc.sunysb.edu|date= |accessdate=2011-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===First voyage===
On the evening of 3 August 1492, Columbus departed from [[Palos de la Frontera]] with three ships; one larger [[carrack]], ''[[Santa María (ship)|Santa María]]'', nicknamed ''Gallega'' (''the Galician''), and two smaller [[caravel]]s, ''[[Pinta (ship)|Pinta]]'' (''the Painted'') and ''Santa Clara'', nicknamed ''[[Niña]]'' after her owner Juan Niño of Moguer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenina.com/the_original_nina.htm The Original Nina] The Columbus Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt; They were property of [[Juan de la Cosa]] and the [[Pinzón brothers]] ([[Martín Alonso Pinzón|Martín Alonso]] and [[Vicente Yáñez Pinzón|Vicente Yáñez]]), but the monarchs forced the [[Palos de la Frontera|Palos]] inhabitants to contribute to the expedition. Columbus first sailed to the [[Canary Islands]], which were owned by [[Crown of Castile|Castile]], where he restocked the provisions and made repairs. On 6 September he departed [[San Sebastián de La Gomera]] for what turned out to be a five-week voyage across the ocean.

A lookout on the ''Pinta'', [[Rodrigo de Triana]] (also known as Juan Rodriguez Bermeo), spotted land about 2 a.m. on the morning of October 12, and immediately alerted the rest of the crew with a shout. Thereupon, the captain of the ''Pinta'', Juan Alonso Pinzón, verified the discovery and alerted Columbus by firing a lombard.&lt;ref&gt;Morison ([[#CITEREFMorison1942|1942]], p.226); Lopez, ([[#CITEREFLopez1990|1990]], [http://books.google.com.au/books?id=wyh9-rhsaQgC&amp;pg=PT14#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.14]); Columbus &amp; Toscanelli ([[#CITEREFColumbusToscanelli2010|2010]], [http://books.google.com.au/books?id=MI7dzFQZHOoC&amp;pg=PA35 p.35])&lt;/ref&gt; Columbus later maintained that he himself had already seen a light on the land a few hours earlier, thereby claiming for himself the lifetime pension promised by Ferdinand and Isabella to the first person to sight land.&lt;ref&gt;Lopez, ([[#CITEREFLopez1990|1990]], [http://books.google.com.au/books?id=wyh9-rhsaQgC&amp;pg=PT15#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.15])&lt;/ref&gt;

Columbus called the island (in what is now [[The Bahamas]]) ''San Salvador''; the natives called it [[Guanahani]]. Exactly which island in the Bahamas this corresponds to is an unresolved topic; prime candidates are [[Samana Cay]], [[Plana Cays]], or [[San Salvador Island]] (so named in 1925 in the belief that it was Columbus's San Salvador). The [[Indigenous Peoples of the Americas|indigenous people]] he encountered, the [[Lucayan]], [[Taíno]] or [[Arawak peoples|Arawak]], were peaceful and friendly. From the 12 October 1492 entry in his journal he wrote of them, &quot;Many of the men I have seen have scars on their bodies, and when I made signs to them to find out how this happened, they indicated that people from other nearby islands come to San Salvador to capture them; they defend themselves the best they can. I believe that people from the mainland come here to take them as slaves. They ought to make good and skilled servants, for they repeat very quickly whatever we say to them. I think they can very easily be made Christians, for they seem to have no religion. If it pleases our Lord, I will take six of them to Your Highnesses when I depart, in order that they may learn our language.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Robert H. Fuson, ed ''The Log of Christopher Columbus'', Tab Books, 1992, International Marine Publishing, ISBN 0-87742-316-4.&lt;/ref&gt; He remarked that their lack of modern weaponry and even metal-forged swords or pikes was a tactical vulnerability, writing, &quot;I could conquer the whole of them with 50 men, and govern them as I pleased.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.www.michigandaily.com/media/storage/paper851/news/2004/10/12/News/Columbus.Day.Sparks.Debate.Over.Explorers.Legacy-1425748.shtml|title=Columbus Day sparks debate over explorer's legacy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Columbus1.PNG|thumb|300px|First voyage]]
Columbus also explored the northeast coast of [[Cuba]] (landed on 28 October) and the northern coast of [[Hispaniola]], by 5 December. Here, the ''[[Santa Maria (ship)|Santa Maria]]'' ran aground on [[Christmas]] morning 1492 and had to be abandoned. He was received by the native [[cacique]] [[Guacanagari]], who gave him permission to leave some of his men behind. Columbus left 39 men and founded the settlement of ''[[La Navidad]]'' at the site of present-day [[Môle-Saint-Nicolas]], [[Haiti]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Maclean, Frances|title=The Lost Fort of Columbus|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/fort-of-columbus-200801.html|publisher=[[Smithsonian Magazine]]|month=January|year=2008|accessdate=2008-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 January 1493 Columbus made his last stop in the New World. He landed on the [[Samaná Peninsula]] where he met the hostile Ciguayos who presented him with his only violent resistance during his first voyage to the Americas. Because of this, and the Ciguayos' use of arrows, he called the inlet where he met them [[Bay of Arrows|the Bay of Arrows (or Gulf of Arrows)]].&lt;ref&gt;Oliver Dunn and James Kelly, The Diario of Christopher Columbus’s First Voyage to America (London: University of Oklahoma Press), 333-343.&lt;/ref&gt; Today the place is called the Bay of Rincon, in Samaná, the [[Dominican Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Fuson, The Log of Christopher Columbus (Camden, International Marine, 1987) 173.&lt;/ref&gt; Columbus kidnapped about 10 to 25 natives and took them back with him (only seven or eight of the native ''Indians'' arrived in Spain alive, but they made quite an impression on [[Seville]]).&lt;ref name=book2&gt;{{cite book|author=James W. Loewen|title=Lies My Teacher Told Me: Everything Your American History Textbook Got Wrong|id={{ASIN|1402579373}}|unused_data=Touchstone Books (1995)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Columbus headed for Spain, but another storm forced him into [[Lisbon]]. He anchored next to the King's harbor patrol ship on 4 March 1493 in Portugal. After spending more than one week in Portugal, he set sail for Spain. He crossed the bar of Saltes and entered the harbor of [[Palos de la Frontera|Palos]] on 15 March 1493. Word of his finding new lands [[Columbus's Letter on the First Voyage|rapidly spread throughout Europe]].

===Second voyage===
Columbus left [[Cadiz]] on 24 September 1493 to find new territories, with 17 ships carrying supplies, and about 1,200 men to colonize the region. The colonists included priests, farmers, and soldiers. This was part of a new policy — not just &quot;colonies of exploitation&quot;, but &quot;colonies of settlement&quot; and conversion of the natives to Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Baccus, M. Kazim ''Utilization, Misuse, and Development of Human Resources in the Early West Ind Colonies'' Wilfrid Laurier University Press (2 January 2000) ISBN 978-0-88920-982-4 pp.6-7&lt;/ref&gt; The crew members may have included free black [[Africa]]ns who arrived in the New World about a decade before the slave trade began.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/05/17/AR2009051701885.html Who Went With Columbus? Dental Studies Give Clues.]&quot;. [[The Washington Post]]. May 18, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 October the ships left the [[Canary Islands]] as they had on the first voyage, following a more southerly course.

On 3 November 1493, Columbus sighted a rugged island that he named [[Dominica]] (Latin for Sunday); later that day, he landed at [[Marie-Galante]], which he named Santa Maria la Galante. After sailing past [[Les Saintes]] (Los Santos, The Saints), he arrived at [[Guadeloupe]] [[Santa María de Guadalupe]] de Extremadura, after the image of the Virgin Mary venerated at the Spanish monastery of [[Villuercas]], in [[Guadalupe, Spain|Guadalupe]] (Spain), which he explored between 4 November and 10 November 1493.

Michele da Cuneo, Columbus’s childhood friend from Savona, sailed with Columbus during the second voyage and wrote: &quot;In my opinion, since Genoa was Genoa, there was never born a man so well equipped and expert in the art of navigation as the said lord Admiral.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Felipe Fernández-Armesto, ''Columbus,'' Oxford Univ. Press, (1991) pp. 103-104&lt;/ref&gt; Columbus named the small island of &quot;[[Saona]]&amp;nbsp;... to honor Michele da Cuneo, his friend from Savona.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Paolo Emilio Taviani, ''Columbus the Great Adventure,'' Orion Books, New York (1991) p. 185&lt;/ref&gt; The father of [[Bartholomé de Las Casas]] also accompanied Colombus on this voyage.&lt;ref name=&quot;traboulay&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Traboulay|first=David M.|title=Columbus and Las Casas|year=1994|publisher=University Press of America|isbn=0-8191-9642-8|page=48|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=7Jmi4Wb1DdsC&amp;pg=PA48&amp;dq=pedro+de+las+casas+columbus&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=CevYTITsApDCsAOa0dSDCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=pedro%20de%20las%20casas%20columbus&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Columbus2.PNG|thumb|300px|Second voyage]]
The exact course of his voyage through the [[Lesser Antilles]] is debated, but it seems likely that he turned north, sighting and naming several islands, including:
* [[Montserrat]] (for Santa Maria de Montserrate, after the Blessed Virgin of the [[Monastery of Montserrat]], which is located on the Mountain of Montserrat, in Catalonia, Spain),
* [[Antigua]] (after a church in [[Seville]], Spain, called Santa Maria la Antigua, meaning &quot;Old St. Mary's&quot;),
* [[Redonda]] (for Santa Maria la Redonda, Spanish for &quot;round&quot;, owing to the island's shape),
* [[Nevis]] (derived from the Spanish, Nuestra Señora de las Nieves, meaning &quot;Our Lady of the Snows&quot;, because Columbus thought the clouds over Nevis Peak made the island resemble a snow-capped mountain),
* [[Saint Kitts]] (for [[St. Christopher]], patron of sailors and travelers),
* [[Saint Eustatius]] (for the early Roman martyr, [[Saint Eustace|St. Eustachius]]),
* [[Saba]] (also for St. Christopher?),
* [[Saint Martin]] (San Martin), and
* [[Saint Croix]] (from the Spanish ''Santa Cruz'', meaning &quot;[[Christian cross|Holy Cross]]&quot;). He also sighted the island chain of the [[Virgin Islands]] (and named them Islas de Santa Ursula y las Once Mil Virgenes, [[Saint Ursula]] and the 11,000 Virgins, a cumbersome name that was usually shortened, both on maps of the time and in common parlance, to Islas Virgenes), and he also named the islands of [[Virgin Gorda]] (the fat virgin), [[Tortola]], and [[Peter Island]] (San Pedro).

He continued to the [[Greater Antilles]], and landed at [[Puerto Rico]] (originally San Juan Bautista, in honor of Saint John the Baptist, a name that was later supplanted by Puerto Rico (English: Rich Port) while the capital retained the name, San Juan) on 19 November 1493. One of the first skirmishes between native Americans and Europeans since the time of the Vikings&lt;ref name=book1&gt;{{Cite book|author=Phillips, Jr., William D. &amp; Carla Rahn Phillips|title=The Worlds of Christopher Columbus|year=1992|isbn= 9780521350976|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt; took place when Columbus's men rescued two boys who had just been castrated by their captors.

On 22 November Columbus returned to Hispaniola, where he intended to visit [[La Navidad|Fuerte de la Navidad]] (Christmas Fort), built during his first voyage, and located on the northern coast of [[Haiti]]. Columbus found Fuerte de la Navidad in ruins, destroyed by the native [[Taino]] people. Among the ruins were the corpses of 11 of the first 39 Spanish to have attempted New World colonization. Columbus then moved more than 100 kilometers eastwards, establishing a new settlement, which he called [[La Isabela]], likewise on the northern coast of [[Hispaniola]], in the present-day [[Dominican Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/03/090319132954.htm Teeth Of Columbus' Crew Flesh Out Tale Of New World Discovery]&quot;. ''ScienceDaily''. March 20, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[La Isabela]] proved to be a poorly chosen location, and the settlement was short-lived.

He left Hispaniola on 24 April 1494, arrived at [[Cuba]] (naming it Juana) on 30 April. He explored the southern coast of Cuba, which he believed to be a peninsula rather than an island, and several nearby islands, including the [[Isla de la Juventud‎|Isle of Pines]] (Isla de las Pinas, later known as La Evangelista, The Evangelist). He reached [[Jamaica]] on 5 May.{{cn|date=May 2011}} He retraced his route to Hispaniola, arriving on 20 August, before he finally returned to Spain.

===Third voyage===
[[Image:Columbus3.PNG|thumb|300px|Third voyage]]
On 30 May 1498, Columbus left with six ships from [[Sanlúcar de Barrameda|Sanlúcar, Spain]], for his third trip to the New World.

Columbus led the fleet to the Portuguese island of [[Porto Santo]], his wife's native land. He then sailed to [[Madeira]] and spent some time there with the Portuguese captain João Gonçalves da Camara before sailing to the [[Canary Islands]] and [[Cape Verde]]. Columbus landed on the south coast of the island of [[Trinidad]] on 31 July. From 4 August through 12 August he explored the [[Gulf of Paria]] which separates [[Trinidad]] from [[Venezuela]]. He explored the mainland of South America, including the [[Orinoco|Orinoco River]]. He also sailed to the islands of [[Chacachacare]] and [[Margarita Island]] and sighted and named [[Tobago]] (Bella Forma) and [[Grenada]] (Concepcion).

Columbus returned to [[Hispaniola]] on 19 August to find that many of the Spanish settlers of the new colony were discontented, having been misled by Columbus about the supposedly bountiful riches of the new world. An entry in his journal from September 1498 reads, &quot;From here one might send, in the name of the Holy Trinity, as many slaves as could be sold...&quot; Since Columbus supported the enslavement of the Hispaniola natives for economic reasons, he ultimately refused to baptize them, as Catholic law forbade the enslavement of Christians.&lt;ref name = &quot;csmonitor_varela&quot;&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/1017/p05s01-woeu.html Who really sailed the ocean blue in 1492?], [[Christian Science Monitor]], 17 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

He had some of his crew hanged for disobeying him. A number of returning settlers and sailors lobbied against Columbus at the Spanish court, accusing him and his brothers of gross mismanagement. On his return he was arrested for a period (see Governorship and arrest section below).

===Fourth voyage===
[[Image:Columbus4.PNG|thumb|300px|Fourth voyage]]
Before leaving for his fourth voyage, Columbus wrote a letter to the Governors of the Bank of St. George, Genoa, dated at Seville, 2 April 1502.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=TKgKAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA128|title='Letter from Christopher Columbus to the Governors of the Bank of St. George, Genoa. Dated at Seville, April 2nd, 1502'|publisher=Books.google.com|date= |accessdate= 2011-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote &quot;Although my body is here my heart is always near you.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=TKgKAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA129|title=The authentic letters of Columbus - Google Books|publisher=Books.google.com|date= |accessdate=2010-07-29|year=1894}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Columbus made a fourth voyage nominally in search of the [[Strait of Malacca]] to the [[Indian Ocean]]. Accompanied by his brother [[Bartolomeo Columbus|Bartolomeo]] and his 13-year-old son [[Fernando Colón|Fernando]], he left [[Cadiz]], (modern Spain), on 11 May 1502, with the ships ''Capitana'', ''Gallega'', ''Vizcaína'' and ''Santiago de Palos''. He sailed to [[Arzila]] on the Moroccan coast to rescue [[Portugal|Portuguese]] soldiers whom he had heard were under siege by the [[Moors]]. On 15 June they landed at Carbet on the island of [[Martinique]] (''Martinica''). A [[hurricane]] was brewing, so he continued on, hoping to find shelter on [[Hispaniola]]. He arrived at [[Santo Domingo]] on 29 June but was denied port, and the new governor refused to listen to his storm prediction. Instead, while Columbus's ships sheltered at the mouth of the [[Rio Jaina]], the first Spanish treasure fleet sailed into the hurricane. Columbus's ships survived with only minor damage, while 29 of the 30 ships in the governor's fleet were lost to [[1492-1524 Atlantic hurricane seasons|the 1 July storm]]. In addition to the ships, 500 lives (including that of the governor, [[Francisco de Bobadilla]]) and an immense cargo of gold were surrendered to the sea.

After a brief stop at [[Jamaica]], Columbus sailed to [[Central America]], arriving at [[Guanaja|Guanaja (Isla de Pinos)]] in the [[Islas de la Bahía department|Bay Islands]] off the coast of [[Honduras]] on 30 July. Here Bartolomeo found native merchants and a large canoe, which was described as &quot;long as a galley&quot; and was filled with cargo. On 14 August he landed on the continental mainland at Puerto Castilla, near [[Trujillo, Honduras]]. He spent two months exploring the coasts of Honduras, [[Nicaragua]], and [[Costa Rica]], before arriving in Almirante Bay, [[Panama]] on 16 October.

[[Image:Eclipse Chistophe Colomb.jpg|thumb|Columbus impresses natives by predicting [[lunar eclipse]].]]
On 5 December 1502, Columbus and his crew found themselves in a storm unlike any they had ever experienced. In his journal Columbus writes,
&lt;blockquote&gt; For nine days I was as one lost, without hope of life. Eyes never beheld the sea so angry, so high, so covered with foam. The wind not only prevented our progress, but offered no opportunity to run behind any headland for shelter; hence we were forced to keep out in this bloody ocean, seething like a pot on a hot fire. Never did the sky look more terrible; for one whole day and night it blazed like a furnace, and the lightning broke with such violence that each time I wondered if it had carried off my spars and sails; the flashes came with such fury and frightfulness that we all thought that the ship would be blasted. All this time the water never ceased to fall from the sky; I do not say it rained, for it was like another deluge. The men were so worn out that they longed for death to end their dreadful suffering.&lt;ref&gt;Morison, Samuel Eliot,''Admiral of the Ocean Sea: A Life of Christopher Columbus'', Boston, 1942, page 617.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In Panama, Columbus learned from the natives of gold and a strait to another ocean. After much exploration, in January 1503 he established a garrison at the mouth of the [[Rio Belen]]. On 6 April one of the ships became stranded in the river. At the same time, the garrison was attacked, and the other ships were damaged (Shipworms also damaged the ships in tropical waters.&lt;ref&gt;The History Channel. Columbus: The Lost Voyage.&lt;/ref&gt;). Columbus left for Hispaniola on 16 April heading north. On 10 May he sighted the [[Cayman Islands]], naming them &quot;''Las Tortugas''&quot; after the numerous [[sea turtle]]s there. His ships next sustained more damage in a storm off the coast of Cuba. Unable to travel farther, on 25 June 1503 they were beached in [[Saint Ann Parish, Jamaica|St. Ann's Bay, Jamaica]].

For a year Columbus and his men remained stranded on Jamaica. A Spaniard, Diego Mendez, and some natives paddled a [[canoe]] to get help from [[Hispaniola]]. That island's governor, [[Nicolás de Ovando y Cáceres]], detested Columbus and obstructed all efforts to rescue him and his men. In the meantime Columbus, in a desperate effort to induce the natives to continue provisioning him and his hungry men, successfully won the favor of the natives by correctly predicting a [[February 1504 lunar eclipse|lunar eclipse for 29 February 1504]], using the ''[[Ephemeris]]'' of the German astronomer [[Regiomontanus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Samuel Eliot Morison]], ''Admiral of the Ocean Sea: A Life of Christopher Columbus'', 1942, pp. 653–54. [[Samuel Eliot Morison]], ''Christopher Columbus, Mariner'', 1955, pp. 184-92.&lt;/ref&gt; Help finally arrived, no thanks to the governor, on 29 June 1504, and Columbus and his men arrived in [[Sanlúcar de Barrameda|Sanlúcar, Spain]], on 7 November.

==Governorship and arrest==
Under the terms of the [[Capitulations of Santa Fe]], after his first voyage Columbus was appointed Viceroy and Governor of the Indies, which in practice entailed primarily the administration of the colonies in the island of [[Hispaniola]], whose capital was established in [[Santo Domingo]]. By the end of his third voyage, Columbus was physically and mentally exhausted: his body was wracked by [[arthritis]] and his eyes by [[ophthalmia]]. In October 1499, he sent two ships to Spain, asking the Court of Spain to appoint a royal commissioner to help him govern. By then, accusations of tyranny and incompetence on the part of Columbus had also reached the Court.

The Court appointed [[Francisco de Bobadilla]], a member of the [[Order of Calatrava]], but not as the aide that Columbus had requested. Instead, Bobadilla was given complete control as governor from 1500 until his death in 1502. Arriving in Santo Domingo while Columbus was away, Bobadilla was immediately peppered with complaints about all three Columbus brothers: Christopher, Bartolomé, and Diego. Consuelo Varela, a Spanish historian, states: &quot;Even those who loved him [Columbus] had to admit the atrocities that had taken place.&quot;&lt;ref name=newspaper1&gt;{{Cite news|author=Giles Tremlett|title=Lost document reveals Columbus as tyrant of the Caribbean|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/spain/article/0,,1838823,00.html?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=12|publisher=The Guardian| date=2006-08-07|accessdate=2006-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bobadilla's 48-page report—derived from the testimonies of 23 people who had seen or heard about the treatment meted out by Columbus and his brothers—had originally been lost for centuries, but was rediscovered in 2005 in the Spanish archives in [[Valladolid]]. It contained an account of Columbus's seven-year reign as the first [[Governor of the Indies]].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Emanuel Gottlieb Leutze - Columbus Before the Queen.JPG|thumb|''Columbus before the Queen'', imagined&lt;ref&gt;The Brooklyn Museum catalogue notes that the most likely source for Leutze's trio of Columbus paintings is [[Washington Irving]]’s best-selling ''Life and Voyages of Columbus'' (1828).&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Emanuel Gottlieb Leutze]], 1843]]
As a result of these testimonies and without being allowed a word in his own defense, Columbus, upon his return, had manacles placed on his arms and chains on his feet and was cast into prison to await return to Spain. He was 48 years old.

On 1 October 1500, Columbus and his two brothers, likewise in chains, were sent back to Spain. Once in Cadiz, a grieving Columbus wrote to a friend at court:

{{quote|It is now seventeen years since I came to serve these princes with the Enterprise of the Indies. They made me pass eight of them in discussion, and at the end rejected it as a thing of jest. Nevertheless I persisted therein... Over there I have placed under their sovereignty more land than there is in Africa and Europe, and more than 1,700 islands... In seven years I, by the divine will, made that conquest. At a time when I was entitled to expect rewards and retirement, I was incontinently arrested and sent home loaded with chains... The accusation was brought out of malice on the basis of charges made by civilians who had revolted and wished to take possession on the land....

I beg your graces, with the zeal of faithful Christians in whom their Highnesses have confidence, to read all my papers, and to consider how I, who came from so far to serve these princes... now at the end of my days have been despoiled of my honor and my property without cause, wherein is neither justice nor mercy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Samuel Eliot Morison]], ''Admiral of the Ocean Sea: A Life of Christopher Columbus'', p. 576.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to an uncatalogued document supposedly discovered very late in history purporting to be a record of Columbus's trial which contained the alleged testimony of 23 witnesses, Columbus regularly used barbaric acts of torture to govern Hispaniola.&lt;ref name=&quot;csmonitor_varela&quot;/&gt;

Columbus and his brothers lingered in jail for six weeks before busy King Ferdinand ordered their release. Not long after, the king and queen summoned the Columbus brothers to the [[Alhambra]] palace in [[Granada]]. There the royal couple heard the brothers' pleas; restored their freedom and wealth; and, after much persuasion, agreed to fund Columbus's fourth voyage. But the door was firmly shut on Columbus's role as governor. Henceforth [[Nicolás de Ovando y Cáceres]] was to be the new governor of the West Indies.

While Columbus had always given the conversion of non-believers as one reason for his explorations, he grew increasingly religious in his later years. Probably with the assistance of his son Diego and his friend the [[Carthusian]] monk Gaspar Gorricio, Columbus produced two books during his later years: a ''[[Book of Privileges]]'' (1502), detailing and documenting the rewards from the [[Monarchy of Spain|Spanish Crown]] to which he believed he and his heirs were entitled, and a ''[[Book of Prophecies]]'' (1505), in which passages from the Bible were used to place his achievements as an explorer in the context of [[Christian eschatology]].&lt;ref name=britannica /&gt;

In his later years, Columbus demanded that the Spanish Crown give him 10% of all profits made in the new lands, as stipulated in the [[Capitulations of Santa Fe]]. Because he had been relieved of his duties as governor, the crown did not feel bound by that contract and his demands were rejected. After his death, his heirs sued the Crown for a part of the profits from trade with America, as well as other rewards. This led to a protracted series of legal disputes known as the ''[[pleitos colombinos]]'' (&quot;Columbian lawsuits&quot;).

On 20 May 1506, at about age 55, Columbus died in [[Valladolid]], fairly wealthy from the gold his men had accumulated in [[Hispaniola]]. At his death, he was still convinced that his journeys had been along the east coast of Asia. According to a study, published in February 2007, by Antonio Rodriguez Cuartero, Department of Internal Medicine of the [[University of Granada]], he died of a heart attack caused by [[reactive arthritis]]. According to his personal diaries and notes by contemporaries, the symptoms of this illness (burning pain during urination, pain and swelling of the knees, and [[conjunctivitis]]) were clearly evident in his last three years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/notas/408828.html|title=Cause of the death of Columbus (in Spanish)|publisher=Eluniversal.com.mx|date= |accessdate=2009-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Columbus' remains were first interred at Valladolid, then at the monastery of [[La Cartuja]] in [[Seville]] (southern Spain) by the will of his son [[Diego Colón|Diego]], who had been governor of [[Hispaniola]]. In 1542 the remains were transferred to [[Ciudad Colonial (Santo Domingo)|Colonial Santo Domingo]], in the present-day [[Dominican Republic]]. In 1795, when France took over the entire island of [[Hispaniola]], Columbus' remains were moved to [[Havana]], [[Cuba]]. After Cuba became independent following the [[Spanish-American War]] in 1898, the remains were moved back to Spain, to the [[Cathedral of Seville]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/servlet/SirveObras/12368307610158273876213/p0000001.htm|title='&amp;#39;Cristóbal Colón: traslación de sus restos mortales a la ciudad de Sevilla'&amp;#39; at Fundación Biblioteca Virtual Miguel de Cervantes|publisher= Cervantesvirtual.com|date= |accessdate=2009-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; where they were placed on an elaborate [[catafalque]].

However, a [[lead]] box bearing an inscription identifying &quot;Don Christopher Columbus&quot; and containing bone fragments and a bullet was discovered at [[Santo Domingo]] in 1877.

To lay to rest claims that the wrong relics had been moved to Havana and that Columbus' remains had been left buried in the cathedral at [[Santo Domingo]], [[DNA]] samples of the corpse resting in [[Seville]] were taken in June 2003 (''History Today'' August 2003) as well as other DNA samples from the remaining of his sons Diego and [[Ferdinand Columbus|Fernando Colón]]. Initial observations suggested that the bones did not appear to belong to somebody with the physique or age at death associated with Columbus.&lt;ref&gt;Giles Tremlett, [http://www.guardian.co.uk/spain/article/0,2763,1280590,00.html Young bones lay Columbus myth to rest], ''[[The Guardian]]'', August 11, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; DNA extraction proved difficult; only short fragments of [[mitochondrial DNA]] could be isolated.

The [[World Columbian Exposition]] in Chicago, 1893, commemorated the 400th anniversary of the landing of Christopher Columbus in the Americas. Over 27 million people attended the exposition during its six-month duration.

The [[U.S. Postal Service]] participated in the celebration issuing the first US [[Commemorative stamp|''commemorative postage stamps]],  a series of 16 postage issues depicting Columbus, Queen Isabella and others in the various stages of his several voyages. The issues range in value from the 1-cent to the 5-dollar denominations. Under Benjamin Harrison and his Postmaster General [[John Wanamaker]] the Columbian commemorative stamps were made available and were first issued at the [[World Columbian Exposition]] in Chicago, Illinois, in 1893. Wanamaker originally introduced the idea of issuing the nation's first commemorative stamp to Harrison, the Congress and the U.S. Post Office. To demonstrate his confidence in the new Columbian commemorative issues Wanamaker purchased $10,000 worth of stamps with his own money.

Identical to the first [[Columbian Issue]] of 1893 a second Columbian issue was released in 1982, commemorating the 500th anniversary. These issues were made from the original dies of which the first engraved issues of 1893 were produced. In 1992 along with the United States, Spain also issued an almost identical series of Columbian issues, (using 'Spain' instead of 'United States of America') celebrating the 500th anniversary of the voyages. The Columbian Exposition lasted several months and by the time it was over more than $40 million dollars had been generated in commemorative postage stamp sales alone.&lt;ref name=&quot;Columbian Exposition&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;JOHN WANAMAKER PMG&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usps.com/postalhistory/_rtf/PMGWanamaker.rtf. |publisher=United States Postal Service |title=JOHN WANAMAKER, Postmaster General |accessdate=19 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 400th anniversary Columbian issues were very popular in the United States; more than a billion of the two-cent editions were printed. &lt;ref&gt;[[Scott catalogue|Scott's United States Stamp Catalogue, Commemorative index, quantities issued]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Although among non-Native Americans Christopher Columbus is traditionally considered the discoverer of America, Columbus was preceded by the various cultures and civilizations of the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]], as well as the [[Western world]]'s [[Vikings]] at [[L'Anse aux Meadows]]. He is regarded more accurately as the person who brought the Americas into the forefront of Western attention. &quot;Columbus's claim to fame isn't that he got there first,&quot; explains historian Martin Dugard, &quot;it's that he stayed.&quot;&lt;ref name=dugard&gt;Dugard, Martin. The Last Voyage of Columbus. Little, Brown and Company: New York, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The popular idea that he was first person to envision a rounded earth is false. The [[Spherical Earth|rounded shape of the earth]] has already been known since [[classical antiquity|antiquity]].

[[Amerigo Vespucci]]'s travel journals, published 1502-4, convinced [[Martin Waldseemüller]] that the discovered place was not India, as Columbus always believed, but a new [[continent]], and in 1507, a year after Columbus's death, Waldseemüller published a world map [[America (name)|calling the new continent]] ''America'' from Vespucci's Latinized name &quot;Americus&quot;. According to Paul Lunde, &quot;The preoccupation of European courts with the rise of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]] in the East partly explains their relative lack of interest in Columbus's discoveries in the West.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/199203/piri.reis.and.the.columbus.map.htm Piri Reis and the Columbus Map]&quot;.

Historically, the British had downplayed Columbus and emphasized the role of the Venetian [[John Cabot]] as a pioneer explorer, but for the emerging United States, Cabot made for a poor national hero. Veneration of Columbus in America dates back to colonial times. The name [[Columbia (name)|Columbia]] for &quot;America&quot; first appeared in a 1738 weekly publication of the debates of the British Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bodley.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/ilej/image1.pl?item=page&amp;seq=5&amp;size=1&amp;id=gm.1738.6.x.8.x.x.285a The Gentleman's Magazine, Vol. 8, June 1738, p. 285].&lt;/ref&gt; The use of Columbus as a founding figure of New World nations and the use of the word 'Columbia', or simply the name 'Columbus', spread rapidly after the American Revolution. In 1812, the name 'Columbus' was given to the newly founded capital of Ohio. During the last two decades of the 18th century the name &quot;Columbia&quot; was given to the federal capital [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]], South Carolina's new capital city [[Columbia, South Carolina|Columbia]], the [[Columbia River]], and numerous other places. Columbia is also the name of [[NASA]]'s first [[Space Shuttle Columbia|Space shuttle]] and was the first to launch into orbit. Outside the United States the name was used in 1819 for the [[Gran Colombia]], a precursor of the modern [[Republic of Colombia]]. The main plaza in [[Mayagüez, Puerto Rico]] is called [[Plaza Colón]] in honor of the Admiral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Plaza Colón|url=http://www.mayaguezpr.gov/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=191&amp;Itemid=163|accessdate=2009-07-27|language=Spanish}}{{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rigau|first=Jorge|coauthors=|year=2009|title=Puerto Rico Then and Now|publisher= Thunder Bay Press|location=San Diego, California|id= |pages=74–75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A candidate for sainthood in the Catholic Church in 1866, celebration of Columbus's legacy perhaps reached a zenith in 1892 when the 400th anniversary of his first arrival in the Americas occurred. Monuments to Columbus like the [[World's Columbian Exposition|Columbian Exposition]] in [[Chicago]] were erected throughout the United States and [[Latin America]] extolling him. Numerous cities, towns, counties, and streets have been named after him, including the [[capital city|capital cities]] of two U.S. [[State (United States)|states]]: [[Ohio]] and [[South Carolina]].

In 1909, descendants of Columbus undertook to dismantle the Columbus family chapel in Spain and move it to [[Boalsburg]] near [[State College]], Pennsylvania, where it may now be visited by the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanderkrogt.net/statues/object.php?webpage=CO&amp;record=uspa14|title=Columbus Monuments Pages: Boalsburg|accessdate=2010-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the museum associated with the chapel, there are a number of Columbus relics worthy of note, including the armchair which the &quot;Admiral of the Ocean Sea&quot; used at his chart table.

More recent views of Columbus, particularly those of Native Americans, have tended to be much more critical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.newhumanist.com/md2.html|title=Christopher Columbus and the Indians|author=Howard Zinn|publisher=Newhumanist.com|date= |accessdate=2008-09-05|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080729234240/http://www.newhumanist.com/md2.html&lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt;|archivedate=2008-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hartford-hwp.com/Taino/docs/columbus.html|title=Jack Weatherford, Examining the reputation of Christopher Columbus|publisher=Hartford-hwp.com|date=2001-04-20|accessdate=2009-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/43a/100.html|title=Pre-Columbian Hispaniola — Arawak/Taino Indians|publisher=Hartford-hwp.com|date=2001-09-15|accessdate=2009-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because the native Taino of Hispaniola, where Columbus began a rudimentary tribute system for gold and cotton, disappeared so rapidly after contact with the Spanish, due to overwork and especially, after 1519, when the first [[pandemic]] struck Hispaniola,&lt;ref&gt;Alfred W.

ISBN 0-521-55203-6.&lt;/ref&gt; The native Taino people of the island were systematically enslaved via the [[encomienda]] system. The pre-Columbian population is estimated to have been perhaps 250,000-300,000. According to the historian [[Gonzalo Fernandez de Oviedo y Valdes]] by 1548, 56 years after Columbus landed, less than five hundred Taino were left on the island.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Crosby, ''The Columbian Exchange'' (Westport, 1972) p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; In another hundred years, perhaps only a handful remained. However, some analyses of the question of Columbus's legacy for Native Americans do not clearly distinguish between the actions of Columbus himself, who died well before the first pandemic to hit Hispaniola or the height of the encomienda system, and those of later European governors and colonists on Hispaniola.

The anniversary of Columbus's 1492 landing in the Americas is usually observed as [[Columbus Day]] on 12 October in [[Spain]] and throughout the Americas, except [[Canada]]. In the [[United States]] it is observed annually on the second Monday in October.

The term &quot;[[pre-Columbian]]&quot; is usually used to refer to the peoples and cultures of the Americas before the arrival of Columbus and his European successors.

*In 1958, the Italian playwright [[Dario Fo]] wrote a satirical play about Columbus titled ''Isabella, tre caravelle e un cacciaballe'' (Isabella, three tall ships and a con man). In 1997 Fo was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]. The play was translated into English in 1988 by [[Ed Emery]] and is downloadable on the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/dariofoarchive/isabella.html|title=Dario Fo Archives online | accessdate = 2009-10-12|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20091021210924/http://geocities.com/dariofoarchive/isabella.html|archivedate=2009-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1991, author [[Salman Rushdie]] published a fictional representation of Columbus in ''[[The New Yorker]]'', &quot;Christopher Columbus and Queen Isabella of Spain Consummate Their Relationship, Santa Fe, January, 1492&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The New Yorker]]'', 17 June 1991, p.&amp;nbsp;32.&lt;/ref&gt;
*In ''[[Pastwatch: The Redemption of Christopher Columbus]]'' (1996) [[science fiction]] novelist [[Orson Scott Card]] focuses on Columbus' life and activities, but the novel's action also deals with a group of scientists from the future who travel back to the 15th century with the goal of changing the pattern of European contact with the Americas.
*British author [[Stephen Baxter]] includes Columbus' quest for royal sponsorship as a crucial historical event in his 2007 science fiction novel ''Navigator'' (ISBN 978-0-441-01559-7), the third entry in the author's ''Time's Tapestry Series''.

;In music
*Christopher Columbus is regularly referred to by singers and musical groups in the [[Rastafari movement]] as an example of a European oppressor. The detractors include [[Burning Spear]] (''Christopher Columbus''), [[Culture (band)|Culture]] (''Capture Rasta''), and [[Peter Tosh]] (''You Can't Blame The Youth'', ''Here Comes The Judge'').

;Onscreen
*''[[Christopher Columbus (film)|Christopher Columbus]]'' is a 1949 film starring [[Fredric March]] as Columbus.
*The 1985 TV [[mini-series]], ''[[Christopher Columbus (TV series)|Christopher Columbus]]'', features [[Gabriel Byrne]] as Columbus.
*Columbus was portrayed by [[Gérard Depardieu]] in the 1992 film by [[Ridley Scott]], ''[[1492: Conquest of Paradise]]''. Scott presented Columbus as a forward-thinking idealist, as opposed to the view that he was ruthless and responsible for the misfortune of Native Americans.
*''[[Carry On Columbus]]'' is a 1992 comedy.
*''[[Christopher Columbus: The Discovery]]'', is a 1992 [[biopic]] film by [[Alexander Salkind]].
*The 42nd episode of ''[[The Sopranos]]'', titled &quot;[[Christopher (The Sopranos)|Christopher]]&quot; (2002), addresses the controversies surrounding Columbus' legacy from the perspectives of numerous identity group members.

[[File:Julie Perkins at LLNL.jpg|right|frame|A chemist pours from a [[round-bottom flask]].]]
A '''chemist''' is a [[scientist]] trained in the study of [[chemistry]]. Chemists study the composition of matter and its properties such as density and acidity. Chemists carefully describe the properties they study in terms of quantities, with detail on the level of [[molecule]]s and their component [[atom]]s. Chemists carefully measure substance proportions, [[Chemical reaction|reaction]] rates, and other [[chemical properties]].

Chemists use this knowledge to learn the composition, and properties of unfamiliar substances, as well as to reproduce and synthesize large quantities of useful naturally occurring substances and create new artificial substances and useful processes. Chemists may specialize in any number of [[Chemistry#Subdisciplines|subdisciplines of chemistry]]. [[Materials science|Materials scientists]] and metallurgists share much of the same education and skills with chemists. [[Chemical engineer]]s are concerned with the physical processes necessary to carry out industrial reactions (heating, cooling, mixing, diffusion etc.) and to separate and purify the products, and work with industrial chemists on the development of new processes.

==History==
{{main|History of chemistry}}

The roots of chemistry can be traced to the phenomenon of [[combustion|burning]]. [[Fire]] was a mystical force that transformed one substance into another and thus was of primary interest to mankind. It was fire that led to the discovery of [[iron]] and [[glass]]. After [[gold]] was discovered and became a precious metal, many people were interested to find a method that could convert other substances into gold. This led to the [[protoscience]] called [[Alchemy]]. The word ''chemist'' is derived from the [[New Latin]] noun ''chimista'', an abbreviation of ''alchimista'' ([[Alchemy|alchemist]]).  Alchemists discovered many [[chemical process]]es that led to the development of modern chemistry. Chemistry as we know it today, was invented by [[Antoine Lavoisier]] with his law of [[Conservation of mass]] in 1783. The [[discoveries of the chemical elements]] has a long history culminating in the creation of the [[periodic table]] by [[Dmitri Mendeleev]]. The [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] created in 1901 gives an excellent overview of chemical discovery since the start of the 20th century.

==Education==
Jobs for chemists usually require at least a [[bachelor's degree]], but many positions, especially those in research, require a [[Ph.D]]. Most undergraduate programs emphasize [[mathematics]] and [[physics]] as well as chemistry, partly because chemistry is also known as &quot;[[the central science]]&quot;, thus chemists ought to have a well-rounded knowledge about science. At the [[Master's degree|Master's]] level and higher, students tend to specialize in a particular field.  Fields of specialization include [[biochemistry]], [[nuclear chemistry]], [[organic chemistry]], [[inorganic chemistry]], [[analytical chemistry]], [[theoretical chemistry]], [[quantum chemistry]], [[environmental chemistry]], and [[physical chemistry]].  [[Postdoctoral]] experience may be required for certain positions.

==Employment==
The three major employers of chemists are academic institutions, industry, especially the [[chemical industry]] and the [[pharmaceutical industry]], and government laboratories.

Chemistry typically is divided into several major sub-disciplines. There are also several main cross-disciplinary and more specialized fields of chemistry.  There is a great deal of overlap between different branches of chemistry, as well as with other scientific fields such as biology, medicine, physics, and several engineering disciplines.

*[[Analytical chemistry]] is the analysis of material samples to gain an understanding of their [[chemical composition]] and [[structure]]. Analytical chemistry incorporates standardized experimental methods in chemistry. These methods may be used in all subdisciplines of chemistry, excluding purely theoretical chemistry.

*[[Biochemistry]] is the study of the [[chemical compound|chemicals]], [[chemical reaction]]s and [[chemical interaction]]s that take place in living [[organism]]s. Biochemistry and organic chemistry are closely related, for example, in [[medicinal chemistry]]. 

[[File:Laura Miller at ANL.jpg|right|frame|A chemist prepares a new [[fuel cell]] for testing.]]

*[[Inorganic chemistry]] is the study of the properties and reactions of inorganic compounds. The distinction between organic and inorganic disciplines is not absolute and there is much overlap, most importantly in the sub-discipline of [[organometallic chemistry]].  Inorganic chemistry is also the study of atomic and molecular structure and bonding.

*[[Medicinal chemistry]] is the science involved with designing, synthesizing and developing pharmaceutical drugs. Medicinal chemistry involves the identification, synthesis and development of new chemical entities suitable for therapeutic use. It also includes the study of existing drugs, their biological properties, and their quantitative structure-activity relationships.

*[[Organic chemistry]] is the study of the structure, properties, composition, mechanisms, and chemical reaction of organic compounds.

*[[Physical chemistry]] is the study of the physical fundamental basis of chemical systems and processes.  In particular, the energetics and dynamics  of such systems and processes are of interest to physical chemists.  Important areas of study include chemical thermodynamics, chemical kinetics, electrochemistry, quantum chemistry, statistical mechanics, and spectroscopy.  Physical chemistry has large overlap with theoretical chemistry and molecular physics. Physical chemistry involves the use of calculus in deriving equations.

*[[Theoretical chemistry]] is the study of chemistry via theoretical reasoning (usually within [[mathematics]] or [[physics]]).  In particular the application of [[quantum mechanics]] to chemistry is called [[quantum chemistry]].  Since the end of the Second World War, the development of computers has allowed a systematic development of [[computational chemistry]], which is the art of developing and applying [[computer program]]s for solving chemical problems.  Theoretical chemistry has large overlap with [[condensed matter physics]] and [[molecular physics]].See [[Reductionism]]. 

All the above major areas of chemistry employ chemists. Other fields where chemical degrees are useful include [[Astrochemistry]] (and [[Cosmochemistry]]), [[Atmospheric chemistry]], [[Chemical Engineering]], [[Chemo-informatics]], [[Electrochemistry]], [[Environmental science]], [[Forensic science]], [[Geochemistry]], [[Green chemistry]], [[History of chemistry]], [[Materials science]], [[Medical science]], [[Molecular Biology]], [[Molecular genetics]], [[Nanotechnology]], [[Nuclear chemistry]], [[Oenology]], [[Organometallic chemistry]], [[Petrochemistry]], [[Pharmacology]], [[Photochemistry]], [[Phytochemistry]], [[Polymer chemistry]], [[Supramolecular chemistry]] and [[Surface chemistry]].

It has been suggested that chemists going into employment in scientific research should honour a [[Hippocratic Oath for Scientists]] which is required as a [[Professional Chemist]].

==Honors and awards==
The highest honor awarded to chemists is the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]], awarded since 1901, by the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]].

'''Cypress Hill''' is an American [[hip hop music|hip hop]] group from [[South Gate, California]]. Cypress Hill was the first Latino hip-hop group to have [[RIAA certification|platinum]] and multi-platinum albums, selling over 18 million albums worldwide. They are one of the most well known groups in [[West Coast rap]] and are critically acclaimed for their first three groundbreaking albums.&lt;ref name=&quot;Edwards&quot;&gt;Edwards, Paul, 2009, ''[[How to Rap]]: The Art &amp; Science of the Hip-Hop MC'', Chicago Review Press, p. 316.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Early works and mainstream success (1989–1995)===
Originally called '''DVX''', the name was changed after [[Mellow Man Ace]] left to go solo in 1988.&lt;ref name=&quot;Biography&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p22/biography|pure_url=yes}}|title=Cypress Hill - Biography|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|publisher=Rovi Corporation, Allmusic.com|accessdate=22 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; After recording a demo in 1989, Cypress Hill signed a record deal with the [[major label]], [[Columbia Records]]. Their [[Cypress Hill (album)|self-titled first album]] was released in August 1991. The lead single was the double [[A-side]] &quot;[[The Phuncky Feel One]]&quot;/&quot;[[How I Could Just Kill a Man]]&quot; which received heavy airplay on urban and college radio. The other two singles released from the album were &quot;Hand on the Pump&quot; and &quot;Latin Lingo&quot;, the latter of which combined English and Spanish lyrics. The success of these singles led to the album selling two million copies in the US alone. The group made their first appearance at [[Lollapalooza]] on the side stage in 1992.

''[[Black Sunday (album)|Black Sunday]]'', the group's second album, debuted at number one on the [[Billboard 200]] in 1993, recording the highest [[Soundscan]] for a rap group up until that time. Also, with their debut still in the charts, they became the first rap group to have 2 albums in the top 10 of the [[Billboard 200]] at the same time. With &quot;[[Insane in the Brain]]&quot; becoming a crossover hit, the album went triple platinum in the U.S. and sold about 3.25 million copies.

Cypress Hill was banned from ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' after Muggs smoked a joint on-air and the group trashed their instruments while playing their second single &quot;I Ain't Goin' Out Like That&quot;. The band headlined the [[Soul Assassins]] tour with [[House of Pain]] and [[Funkdoobiest]] as support, then performed on a college tour with [[Rage Against the Machine]] and [[Seven Year Bitch]]. In 1993, Cypress Hill also had two tracks on the ''[[Judgment Night (film)|Judgment Night]]'' soundtrack, teaming up with [[Pearl Jam]] on the track &quot;Real Thing&quot; and [[Sonic Youth]] on &quot;I Love You Mary Jane&quot;.

The group played at the 1994 [[Woodstock Festival]], introducing new member Eric Bobo, son of [[Willie Bobo]] and formerly a percussionist with the [[Beastie Boys]]. ''Rolling Stone'' magazine named the group as the best rap group in their music awards voted by critics and readers. Cypress Hill played at [[Lollapalooza]] for two successive years, topping the bill in 1995. They also appeared on the &quot;[[Homerpalooza]]&quot; episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]''. Prior to Bobo joining the crew, Panchito &quot;Ponch&quot; Gomez sat in as a percussionist when not acting.

Their third album ''[[III: Temples of Boom]]'' was released in 1995, selling 1.5 million copies and reaching number 3 on the Billboard 200 on the strength of the hit single &quot;Throw Your Set in the Air&quot; {{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}. Cypress Hill also contributed a track &quot;I Wanna Get High&quot; to the [[High Times]] sponsored ''[[Hempilation]]'' album to support [[National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws|NORML]].

===Continued career (1996–2002)===
Sen Dog took a break from the band to form a Los Angeles based rap rock band [[SX-10]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=''SX10 tocara hoy en el DanZoo'' |url=http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2003/05/24/21an2esp.php?printver=1&amp;fly=2 |publisher=''[[La Jornada]]'' |location=Mexico City |date=May 24, 2003 |accessdate=December 31, 2008 |language=Spanish }}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile in 1996, Cypress Hill appeared on the first 'Smokin' Grooves' tour, featuring [[Ziggy Marley]], [[The Fugees]], [[Busta Rhymes]] and [[A Tribe Called Quest]]. The band also released a nine track EP ''[[Unreleased and Revamped]]'' with rare mixes.  In 1997, band members focused on their solo careers. Muggs released ''Muggs Presents ... the Soul Assassins'' featuring contributions [[Dr. Dre]], [[KRS-One]], [[Wyclef Jean]] and [[Mobb Deep]]. B-Real appeared with Busta Rhymes, [[Coolio]], [[LL Cool J]] and [[Method Man]] on &quot;Hit Em High&quot; from the multi-platinum ''[[Space Jam (soundtrack)|Space Jam Soundtrack]]''. He also appeared with [[RBX]], [[Nas]] and KRS-One on &quot;East Coast Killer, West Coast Killer&quot; on Dr. Dre's ''[[Dr. Dre Presents the Aftermath]]'' album, and contributed to an album entitled &quot;The Psycho Realm&quot; with the band of the same name. Though the focus that year was not on Cypress Hill, the band played Smokin' Grooves with [[George Clinton (funk musician)|George Clinton]] and [[Erykah Badu]].

Cypress Hill released ''[[IV (Cypress Hill album)|IV]]'' in 1998 which went gold in the U.S., on the backs of hit singles &quot;Tequila Sunrise&quot; and another tribute to smoking cannabis &quot;Dr. Greenthumb.&quot; Sen Dog also released the ''Get Wood'' sampler as part of SX-10 on the label Flip.  In 1999, Cypress Hill helped with the [[Personal computer|PC]] crime/very mature video game ''[[Kingpin: Life of Crime]]''. Three of their songs from the 1998 ''IV'' album were in the game ( &quot;16 Men Till There's No Men Left&quot;, &quot;Checkmate&quot; and &quot;Lightning Strikes&quot;). B-Real also did some of the voices of the people in the game.  Also in 1999, the band released a greatest-hits album in Spanish, ''[[Los grandes éxitos en español]]''. In 2000, Cypress Hill then fused genres with their fifth album, ''[[Skull &amp; Bones (album)|Skull &amp; Bones]]'', which was a two-disc album. The first disc, &quot;Skull&quot; was composed of rap tracks while &quot;Bones&quot; explored further the group's forays into rock. The album reached the Top 5 on the [[Billboard magazine|Billboard]] 200 and number 3 in Canada. The first single was &quot;Rock Superstar&quot; for rock radio and &quot;Rap Superstar&quot; for urban radio. Following the release of the album, Cypress Hill (along with [[MxPx]]) landed a slot opening for [[The Offspring]] on the ''[[Conspiracy of One]]'' tour. The band also released ''[[Live at the Fillmore (Cypress Hill album)|Live at the Fillmore]]'', a concert disc recorded at the [[Fillmore]] (in San Francisco) in 2000. Cypress Hill continued their experimentation with rock on the ''[[Stoned Raiders]]'' album in 2001. However, its sales were a disappointment, as the disc did not even reach the top 50 of the U.S. album charts. In 2001, the group appeared in the film ''[[How High]]''.

===''Till Death Do Us Part'' (2003–2007)===
Cypress Hill recorded &quot;Just Another Victim&quot; for [[WWE]] as a theme song for [[Tazz]]. At the time, WWE was using original music for almost all of the wrestlers, so this was an unusual step for the company to take, but it remains one of the more memorable songs to emerge from the wrestling organization.  The band released ''[[Till Death Do Us Part (Cypress Hill album)|Till Death Do Us Part]]'' on March 23, 2004. The album saw the band experiment with [[reggae]] especially on the lead single &quot;What's Your Number&quot;. The track features [[Tim Armstrong]] of [[Rancid (band)|Rancid]] on guitar and backup vocals. It is based on the classic song &quot;[[The Guns of Brixton]]&quot; on [[The Clash]]'s ''[[London Calling]]'' and has proven to be a success on the modern rock charts. However, the album represented a further departure from the signature sound of their first four albums. The album also features appearances by [[Damian Marley]], son of [[Bob Marley]], Prodigy and Twin of [[Mobb Deep]] and producer [[The Alchemist (producer)|the Alchemist]].

In 2004, the song ''How I Could Just Kill A Man'' was included in the popular [[videogame]] [[Grand Theft Auto San Andreas]] created by [[Rockstar Games]], playing on [[West Coast hip hop]] radio station [[Radio Los Santos]].  In December 2005 a best of [[compilation album]] titled [[Greatest Hits From the Bong]] was released including 9 hits from previous albums and 2 new tracks. The group's next album was tentatively scheduled for an early 2007 release.  In the summer of 2006, B-Real appeared on [[Snoop Dogg]]'s single &quot;[[Vato]]&quot;, produced by [[Pharrell Williams]].

In 2007 Cypress Hill toured with their full line up as a part of the [[Rock the Bells]] tour, held by Guerilla Union, and headlined with [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]], [[Wu-Tang Clan]], [[Nas]], and a reunited [[Rage Against the Machine]]. Other acts included [[Immortal Technique]], [[Mos Def]], [[Talib Kweli]], [[The Roots]], [[EPMD]], [[Pharoahe Monch]], [[Jedi Mind Tricks]], [[Erykah Badu]], [[MF Doom]], [[Sage Francis]], [[Brother Ali]], [[The Coup]], [[Blue Print]], Lucky I Am, [[Living Legends]], [[Felt]], [[Cage (rapper)|Cage]], [[Mr. Lif]], Grouch &amp; Eligh, Slightly Stoopid, and [[Hangar 18]].

===Departure from Sony and ''Rise Up'' (2008–present)===
On July 25, 2008, Cypress Hill performed at a benefit concert at the House of Blues Chicago, where a majority of the proceeds went to the Chicago Alliance to End Homelessness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theblackspotlight.com/news/Cypress_Hill_To_Perform_At_Benefit_To_End_Homelessness.html |title=Cypress Hill To Perform At Benefit of Homelessness in youth dance event for euphoria and aid relief |publisher=Theblackspotlight.com |date= |accessdate=2011-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2009, a new song by Cypress Hill, titled &quot;Get 'Em Up&quot;, was made available on iTunes. The song is featured on the Madden NFL 2010 video game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/224562-madden-2010-soundtrack-revealed|title=Madden 2010 Soundtrack Revealed|date=2009-07-26|publisher=Bleacher Report, Inc.|accessdate=22 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2009, a new version of [[Guns N' Roses]] classic &quot;[[Paradise City]]&quot; performed by Cypress Hill, [[Slash (musician)|Slash]] and [[Stacy Ferguson|Fergie]] was made available as a bonus track to Slash's single &quot;[[Sahara (Slash song)|Sahara]]&quot; off Slash's solo album ''[[Slash (album)|Slash]]''.

Cypress Hill's eighth studio album, ''[[Rise Up (Cypress Hill album)|Rise Up]]'', features contributions from [[Everlast (musician)|Everlast]], [[Tom Morello]], [[Daron Malakian]], [[Pitbull (rapper)|Pitbull]], [[Marc Anthony]] and [[Mike Shinoda]].&lt;ref name=&quot;RiseUp&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsroom.mtv.com/2008/10/03/cypress-hill-to-return-with-help-from-slash-tom-morello-and-mike-shinoda/|title=Cypress Hill to Return With Help From Slash, Tom Morello and Mike Shinoda|accessdate=September 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album was released on [[Priority Records|Priority Records/EMI Entertainment]], as the group was signed to the label by new Creative Chairman [[Snoop Dogg]] on January 15, 2010. The album was finally released on April 20, 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;Priority&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allhiphop.com/stories/news/archive/2010/01/15/22097556.aspx|title=Snoop Dogg Signs Cypress Hill To Priority|last=Wolfe|first=Roman|date=2010-01-15|publisher=Infinity, Allhiphop.com, Inc.|accessdate=22 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The album's introduction single, &quot;It Ain't Nothin'&quot; was released as a free download from the group's official website. The song &quot;Rise Up&quot; was featured at [[WWE|WWE's]] pay-per-view, [[Elimination Chamber (2010)|Elimination Chamber]], as the official theme song for that event, and was released as the third single for the album, with &quot;Armada Latina&quot; being fourth. The song also appeared in the trailer of the upcoming movie ''[[The Green Hornet (2011 film)|The Green Hornet]]''

Cypress Hill commenced its Rise Up tour in Philadelphia on April 10, 2010. DJ Muggs was noticeably absent and it appears that [[Julio G]] has replaced DJ Muggs for the tour. DJ Muggs has been absent due to working on several other projects, including separate albums with B-Real and Sen Dog.  The group was supposed to stop in Tucson, Arizona but canceled the show in protest of the recent immigration legislation. At the [[Rock en Seine]] festival in [[Paris]] on August 27, 2010 they said in an [[interview]] that they would wait and see what happens with the [[legislation]] before going back there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.english.rfi.fr/visiting-france/20100828-cypress-hill-love-snails-and-dope-not-arizonas-law |title=Cypress Hill - Love the snails and the dope, but not Arizona's law &amp;#124; RFI |publisher=| |date= |accessdate=2011-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cypress Hill performed at the [[Reading and Leeds Festivals]] in late August 2010, on the 28th at Leeds and the 29th at Reading.

==Style==
===Rapping===
One of the band's most striking aspects is B-Real's exaggeratedly high-pitched nasal vocals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Biography&quot; /&gt; In the book ''[[Check the Technique]]'' B-Real describes his nasal style, saying his rapping voice is &quot;high and annoying... the nasal style I have was just something that I developed... my more natural style wasn't so pleasing to [DJ Muggs and Sen Dog's] ears&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Coleman&quot;&gt;Coleman, Brian. ''[[Check The Technique]]: Liner Notes For Hip-Hop Junkies''. New York: Villard/Random House, 2007, pp. 122-123.&lt;/ref&gt; and talking about the nasal style in the book ''[[How to Rap]]'', B-Real says, &quot;you want to stand out from the others and just be distinct... when you got something that can separate you from everybody else, you gotta use it to your advantage.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Edwards&quot; /&gt; Sen Dog's voice is deeper, more violent and often shouted alongside the rapping; his vocals are often emphasized by adding an additional background/choir voice to say them. Sen Dog's style is in contrast to B-Real's, who says, &quot;[Sen's] voice is so strong&quot;, and &quot;it all blends together&quot; when they are both on the same track.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coleman&quot; /&gt;

Both B-Real and Sen Dog started writing lyrics in both Spanish and English and B-Real was inspired to start writing raps from watching Sen Dog and [[Mellow Man Ace]] writing their lyrics,&lt;ref name=&quot;Coleman&quot; /&gt; and originally B-Real was going to just be the writer for the group rather than a rapper.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coleman&quot; /&gt; Their lyrics are noted for bringing a &quot;cartoonish&quot; approach to violence by [[Peter Shapiro (journalist)|Peter Shapiro]] and Allmusic&lt;ref name=&quot;Biography&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Shapiro&quot;&gt;Shapiro, Peter, 2005, ''The Rough Guide To Hip-Hop'', 2nd Edition, Penguin, pp. 73-74.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Production===
The sound and groove of their music, produced by Muggs, is notable for its spooky sounds and stoned aesthetic; with its bass-heavy rhythms and odd sample loops (&quot;Insane in the Brain&quot; is notable for having a pitched-altered horse neigh looped in its chorus), it carries a psychedelic value, which lessened in the later albums.&lt;ref name=&quot;Biography&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Shapiro&quot; /&gt;

The band is also known for involving rock instruments and  in their songs – this has caused the band to sometimes be classified as a [[Rapcore]] group.&lt;ref name=&quot;Biography&quot; /&gt; The double album ''Skull &amp; Bones'' consists of a pure rap album (&quot;Skull&quot;) and an entire CD of rap/rock songs (&quot;Bones&quot;). Also in ''IV'', there is ''Lightning Strikes'' which doesn't truly use electric guitars, but a synthesized version of it. In the live album &quot;Live at The Fillmore&quot; some of the old classics are played in a rock/metal version, with Sen Dog's band SX-10 and [[Eric Bobo]] playing the rock instruments.

The band's music is constantly subject to change: while the first album and ''Black Sunday'' follow a more minimalistic and funky sound, ''III (Temples of Boom)'' has a very dark, spooky atmosphere and heavy beats, sometimes approaching [[hardcore rap]]. ''IV'' introduced more diverse sounds on the beats while maintaining the hardcore edge. The first albums are mostly influenced by psychedelic music, but the band eventually got closer to modern rap as it is today while still experimenting with rock from time to time, like on &quot;Skull and Bones&quot; and &quot;Stoned Raiders&quot;.

The band involves horns in their songs, and often have guitar and horns together in the instrumentals. ''What's Your Number?'', ''Trouble'', ''Tequila Sunrise'', and ''(Rock) Superstar'' have become some of the bands most popular songs featuring these elements.

==Side and solo projects==

Eric Bobo is part of the group Sol Invicto with producer [[Richie Londres]] and [[Stephen Carpenter]] of the Deftones. Eric Bobo is also a main member of [[Cultura Londres Proyecto]] which is a Spanish Hip Hop group from London, England.

2009 saw the releases of both B-Real and Sen Dog's solo efforts [[Smoke N Mirrors]] and [[Diary of a Mad Dog]]. B-Real is also part of a super-group called Serial Killaz with both [[Xzibit]] and his protege [[Young De]]. B-Real started his own production company called Audio Hustlaz, with which he has worked and featured on tracks with [[Kurupt]], Young De, Xzibit, [[Adil Omar]], [[Snoop Dogg]], [[Bitza]] and others, and has also done guest appearances for [[La Coka Nostra]], [[Ill Bill]], [[Akrobatik]], [[The Outlawz]], [[Nipsey Hussle]] and [[Apathy (rapper)|Apathy]].

Other notable side projects include B-Real's [[rap metal]] group [[Kush (band)|Kush]] with members from [[Deftones]] and [[Fear Factory]] who are as yet to release any official material.

[[File:Et baal.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[flame]]s caused as a result of a [[fuel]] undergoing combustion (burning)]]
'''Combustion''' ({{IPA-en|kəmˈbʌs.tʃən }}) or '''burning''' is the sequence of [[exothermic]] chemical reactions between a [[fuel]] and an [[oxidant]] accompanied by the production of [[heat]] and conversion of chemical species. The release of heat can result in the production of [[light]] in the form of either [[smouldering|glowing]] or a [[flame]]. Fuels of interest often include organic compounds (especially [[hydrocarbon]]s) in the gas, [[liquid]] or solid phase.

In a complete combustion reaction, a compound reacts with an oxidizing element, such as [[oxygen]] or [[fluorine]], and the products are compounds of each element in the fuel with the oxidizing element. For example:

:{{chem|CH|4}} + 2 {{chem|O|2}} → {{chem|CO|2}} + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + energy
:CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S + 6 {{chem|F|2}} → {{chem|CF|4}} + 2 {{chem|HF}} + {{chem|SF|6}}

A simple example can be seen in the combustion of [[hydrogen]] and [[oxygen]], which is a commonly used reaction in [[rocket engines]]:

:2 {{chem|H|2}} + {{chem|O|2}} → 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O(g) + heat
The result is water vapor.

Complete combustion is almost impossible to achieve. In reality, as actual combustion reactions come to [[Chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]], a wide variety of major and minor species will be present such as [[carbon monoxide]] and pure [[carbon]] ([[soot]] or ash).  Additionally, any combustion in [[Atmosphere|atmospheric]] [[air]], which is 78% [[nitrogen]], will also create several forms of [[nitrogen oxides]].

==Types==
===Complete vs. incomplete===
{{seealso|pyrolysis}}
In complete combustion, the reactant burns in oxygen, producing a limited number of products. When a [[hydrocarbon]] burns in oxygen, the reaction will only yield carbon dioxide and water.  When elements are burned, the products are primarily the most common oxides. Carbon will yield [[carbon dioxide]], nitrogen will yield [[nitrogen dioxide]], sulfur will yield [[sulfur dioxide]], and iron will yield [[iron(III) oxide]].

Combustion is not necessarily favorable to the maximum degree of oxidation and it can be temperature-dependent. For example, [[sulfur trioxide]] is not produced quantitatively in combustion of sulfur. Nitrogen oxides start to form above {{convert|2800|F|C}} and more nitrogen oxides are produced at higher temperatures. Below this temperature, molecular nitrogen (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is favored. It is also a function of oxygen excess.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alentecinc.com/papers/NOx/The%20formation%20of%20NOx_files/The%20formation%20of%20NOx.htm The formation of NOx]. Alentecinc.com. Retrieved on 2010-09-28.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In most industrial applications and in [[fire]]s, [[air]] is the source of oxygen (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).  In air, each [[Kilogram|kg]] ([[Pound (mass)|lbm]]) of oxygen is mixed with approximately 3.76&amp;nbsp;kg&amp;nbsp;(lbm) of [[nitrogen]].  Nitrogen does not take part in combustion, but at high temperatures, some nitrogen will be converted to [[NOx#Thermal|NO&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;]], usually between 1% and 0.002% (2 ppm).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.northeastchp.org/nac/businesses/emissions.htm CHP Emissions]. Northeastchp.org. Retrieved on 2010-09-28.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, when there is any incomplete combustion, some of carbon is converted to [[carbon monoxide]]. A more complete set of equations for combustion of methane in air is therefore:

:{{chem|CH|4}} + 2 {{chem|O|2}} → {{chem|CO|2}} + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
:2 {{chem|CH|4}} + 3 {{chem|O|2}} → 2 {{chem|CO}} + 4 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
:{{chem|N|2}} + {{chem|O|2}}  → 2 {{chem|NO}}
:{{chem|N|2}} + 2 {{chem|O|2}}  → 2 {{chem|NO|2}}

===Incomplete===
Incomplete combustion will only occur when there isn't enough oxygen to allow the fuel to react completely to produce carbon dioxide and water. It also happens when the combustion is quenched by a heat sink such as a solid surface or flame trap. 

For most fuels, such as diesel oil, coal or wood, [[pyrolysis]] occurs before combustion. In incomplete combustion, products of pyrolysis remain unburnt and contaminate the smoke with noxious particulate matter and gases. Partially oxidized compounds are also a concern; partial oxidation of ethanol can produce harmful [[acetaldehyde]], and carbon can produce toxic [[carbon monoxide]].

The quality of combustion can be improved by design of combustion devices, such as [[Oil burner|burner]]s and [[internal combustion engines]]. Further improvements are achievable by [[catalytic]] after-burning devices (such as [[catalytic converter]]s) or by the simple partial return of the exhaust gases into the combustion process. Such devices are required by [[environmental legislation]] for cars in most countries, and may be necessary in large combustion devices, such as [[thermal power plants]], to reach legal [[emission standards]].

The degree of combustion can be measured and analyzed, with test equipment. [[HVAC]] contractors, [[Firefighter|firemen]] and [[engineers]] use combustion analyzers to test the [[Fuel efficiency|efficiency]] of a burner during the combustion process. In addition, the efficiency of an internal combustion engine can be measured in this way, and some states and local municipalities are using combustion analysis to define and rate the efficiency of vehicles on the road today.

===Smoldering===
[[Smoldering]] is the slow, low-temperature, flameless form of combustion, sustained by the heat evolved when oxygen directly attacks the surface of a condensed-phase fuel. It is a typically incomplete combustion reaction. Solid materials that can sustain a smoldering reaction include coal, cellulose, wood, cotton, tobacco, peat, duff, humus, synthetic foams, charring polymers including polyurethane foam, and  dust. Common examples of smoldering phenomena are the initiation of residential fires on upholstered furniture by weak heat sources (e.g., a cigarette, a short-circuited wire), and the persistent combustion of biomass behind the flaming front of wildfires

===Rapid===
[[Image:Water cooler bottle ignition.jpg|thumb|alt=Container of ethanol vapour mixed with air, undergoing rapid combustion|Container of ethanol vapour mixed with air, undergoing rapid combustion]]
Rapid combustion is a form of combustion, otherwise known as a [[fire]], in which large amounts of heat and [[light]] energy are released, which often results in a [[flame]]. This is used in a form of machinery such as [[internal combustion engine]]s and in [[thermobaric weapon]]s. Sometimes, a large volume of gas is liberated in combustion besides the production of heat and light. The sudden evolution of large quantities of gas creates excessive pressure that produces a loud noise. Such a combustion is known as an [[explosion]]. Combustion need not involve oxygen; e.g., hydrogen burns in chlorine to form hydrogen chloride with the liberation of heat and light characteristic of combustion.

===Turbulent===
Combustion resulting in a turbulent flame is the most used for industrial application (e.g. gas turbines, gasoline engines, etc.) because the turbulence helps the mixing process between the fuel and oxidizer.

===Microgravity===
[[Image:Microgravity Burning.jpg|thumb|Colourized gray-scale composite image of the individual frames from a video of a backlit fuel droplet burning in microgravity.]]

Combustion processes behave differently in a [[microgravity environment]] than in Earth-gravity conditions due to the lack of [[buoyancy]]. For example, a candle's flame takes the shape of a sphere.&lt;ref&gt;[http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/history/shuttle-mir/science/mg/nm21460011.htm Shuttle-Mir History/Science/Microgravity/Candle Flame in Microgravity (CFM) – MGBX]. Spaceflight.nasa.gov (1999-07-16). Retrieved on 2010-09-28.&lt;/ref&gt; Microgravity combustion research contributes to understanding of spacecraft fire safety and diverse aspects of combustion physics.

==Micro Combustion==
Combustion processes which happen in very small volume are considered as [[micro combustion]]. [[Quenching]] distance plays a vital role in stabilizing the flame in such combustion chambers.

==Chemical Equation==

Generally, the [[chemical equation]] for [[Stoichiometry|stoichiometric]] burning of [[hydrocarbon]] in oxygen is
:&lt;math&gt;C_xH_y + \left( x + \frac{y}{4} \right) O_2 \rightarrow \; xCO_2 + \left( \frac{y}{2} \right) H_2O&lt;/math&gt;

For example, the burning of [[propane]] is
:&lt;math&gt;C_3H_8 + 5O_2 \rightarrow \; 3CO_2 + 4H_2O&lt;/math&gt;

Generally, the [[chemical equation]] for [[Stoichiometry|stoichiometric]] incomplete combustion of [[hydrocarbon]] in oxygen is as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;\left( z \right) C_xH_y + \left( z \left(\frac{x}{2} + \frac{y}{4} \right) \right) O_2 \rightarrow \; z \cdot xCO + \left( \frac{z \cdot y}{2} \right) H_2O&lt;/math&gt;

For example, the incomplete combustion of [[propane]] is:
:&lt;math&gt;2C_3H_8 + 7O_2 \rightarrow \; 2C + 2CO + 8H_2O + 2CO_2&lt;/math&gt;

The simple word equation for the combustion of a hydrocarbon in oxygen is:
:&lt;math&gt;\textrm{Fuel} + \textrm{Oxygen} \rightarrow \; \textrm{Heat} + \textrm{Water} + \textrm{Carbon\ dioxide}&lt;/math&gt;

If the combustion takes place using air as the oxygen source, the nitrogen can be added to the equation,as and although it does not react, to show the composition of the flue gas:
:&lt;math&gt;C_xH_y + \left( x+ \frac{y}{4} \right) O_2 + 3.76 \left( x+ \frac{y}{4} \right) N_2 \rightarrow \; xCO_2 + \left( \frac{y}{2} \right) H_2O + 3.76 \left( x + \frac{y}{4} \right) N_2&lt;/math&gt;

For example, the burning of [[propane]] is:
:&lt;math&gt;C_3H_8 + 5O_2 + 18.8N_2 \rightarrow \; 3CO_2 + 4H_2O + 18.8N_2&lt;/math&gt;

The simple word equation for this type of combustion is hydrocarbon in air:
:&lt;math&gt;\textrm{Fuel} + \textrm{Air} \rightarrow \; \textrm{Heat} + \textrm{Water} + \textrm{Carbon\ dioxide} + \textrm{Nitrogen}&lt;/math&gt;

Nitrogen may also oxidize when there is an excess of oxygen. The reaction is thermodynamically favored only at high temperatures. [[Diesel engines]] are run with an excess of oxygen to combust small particles that tend to form with only a stoichiometric amount of oxygen, necessarily producing nitrogen oxide emissions. Both the United States and European Union are planning to impose limits to nitrogen oxide emissions, which necessitate the use of a special [[catalytic converter]] or treatment of the exhaust with [[urea]].

==Fuels==
===Liquid fuels===

Combustion of a liquid fuel in an oxidizing atmosphere actually happens in the gas phase. It is the vapour that burns, not the liquid. Therefore, a liquid will normally catch fire only above a certain temperature: its [[flash point]]. The flash point of a liquid fuel is the lowest temperature at which it can form an ignitable mix with air. It is also the minimum temperature at which there is enough evaporated fuel in the air to start combustion.

===Solid fuels===

The act of combustion consists of three relatively distinct but overlapping phases:
* '''Preheating phase''', when the unburned [[fuel]] is heated up to its flash point and then [[fire point]]. Flammable gases start being evolved in a process similar to [[dry distillation]].
* '''Distillation phase''' or '''gaseous phase''', when the mix of evolved flammable gases with oxygen is ignited. Energy is produced in the form of heat and light. [[Flame]]s are often visible. Heat transfer from the combustion to the solid maintains the evolution of flammable vapours.
* '''Charcoal phase''' or '''solid phase''', when the output of flammable gases from the material is too low for persistent presence of flame and the [[charring|charred]] fuel does not burn rapidly anymore but just glows and later only [[smoulder]]s.

[[File:disfig1.svg|thumb|centre|450px|A general scheme of [[polymer]] combustion]]

==Reaction mechanism==
Combustion in oxygen is a [[Radical (chemistry)|radical]] chain reaction where many distinct radical intermediates participate.

The high energy required for initiation is explained by the unusual structure of the dioxygen molecule. The lowest-energy configuration of the dioxygen molecule is a stable, relatively unreactive diradical in a [[triplet oxygen|triplet spin state]]. Bonding can be described with three bonding electron pairs and two antibonding electrons, whose [[Spin (physics)|spin]]s are aligned, such that the molecule has nonzero total angular momentum. Most fuels, on the other hand, are in a singlet state, with paired spins and zero total angular momentum. Interaction between the two is quantum mechanically a &quot;[[forbidden transition]]&quot;, i.e. possible with a very low probability. To initiate combustion, energy is required to force dioxygen into a spin-paired state, or [[singlet oxygen]]. This intermediate is extremely reactive. The energy is supplied as [[heat]]. The reaction produces heat, which keeps it going.

Combustion of hydrocarbons is thought to be initiated by hydrogen atom abstraction (not proton abstraction) from the fuel to oxygen, to give a hydroperoxide radical (HOO). This reacts further to give hydroperoxides, which break up to give [[hydroxyl radical]]s. There are a great variety of these processes that produce fuel radicals and oxidizing radicals. Oxidizing species include singlet oxygen, hydroxyl, monatomic oxygen, and [[hydroperoxyl]]. Such intermediates are short-lived and cannot be isolated. However, non-radical intermediates are stable and are produced in incomplete combustion. An example is [[acetaldehyde]] produced in the combustion of [[ethanol]]. An intermediate in the combustion of carbon and hydrocarbons, [[carbon monoxide]], is of special importance because it is a [[Poison|poisonous gas]], but also economically useful for the production of [[syngas]].

Solid fuels also undergo a great number of [[pyrolysis]] reactions that give more easily oxidized, gaseous fuels. These reactions are endothermic and require constant energy input from the combustion reactions. A lack of oxygen or other poorly designed conditions result in these noxious and carcinogenic pyrolysis products being emitted as thick, black smoke.

==Temperature==
Assuming perfect combustion conditions, such as complete combustion under [[adiabatic]] conditions (i.e., no heat loss or gain), the adiabatic combustion temperature can be determined. The formula that yields this temperature is based on the [[first law of thermodynamics]] and takes note of the fact that the [[heat of combustion]] is used entirely for heating the fuel, the combustion air or oxygen, and the combustion product gases (commonly referred to as the ''[[flue gas]]'').

In the case of fossil fuels burnt in air, the combustion temperature depends on all of the following:
* the [[Heat of combustion|heating value]];
* the [[air-fuel ratio|stoichiometric air to fuel ratio]] &lt;math&gt;{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt;;
* the [[specific heat capacity]] of fuel and air;
* the air and fuel inlet temperatures.

The adiabatic combustion temperature (also known as the ''[[adiabatic flame temperature]]'') increases for higher heating values and inlet air and fuel temperatures and for stoichiometric air ratios approaching one.

Most commonly, the adiabatic combustion temperatures for coals are around {{convert|2200|C|0|abbr=on}} (for inlet air and fuel at ambient temperatures and for &lt;math&gt;\lambda = 1.0&lt;/math&gt;), around {{convert|2150|C|0|abbr=on}} for oil and {{convert|2000|C|0|abbr=on}} for [[natural gas]].

In industrial [[furnace|fired heaters]], [[power plant]] steam generators, and large [[gas turbine|gas-fired turbines]], the more common way of expressing the usage of more than the stoichiometric combustion air is ''percent excess combustion air''. For example, excess combustion air of 15 percent means that 15 percent more than the required stoichiometric air is being used.

==Instabilities==

Combustion instabilities are typically violent pressure oscillations in a combustion chamber. These pressure oscillations can be as high as 180 dB, and long term exposure to these cyclic pressure and thermal loads reduces the life of engine components. In rockets, such as the F1 used in the Saturn V program, instabilities led to massive damage of the combustion chamber and surrounding components. This problem was solved by re-designing the fuel injector. In liquid jet engines the droplet size and distribution can be used to attenuate the instabilities. Combustion instabilities are a major concern in ground-based gas turbine engines because of NOx emissions. The tendency is to run lean, an equivalence ratio less than 1, to reduce the combustion temperature and thus reduce the NOx emissions; however, running the combustion lean makes it very susceptible to combustion instabilities.

The [[Thermoacoustic hot air engine|Rayleigh Criterion]] is the basis for analysis of thermoacoustic combustion instabilities and is evaluated using the Rayleigh Index over one cycle of instability:{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}

:&lt;math&gt;G(x)=\frac{1}{T}\int_{T}q'(x,t)p'(x,t)dt&lt;/math&gt;

where q' is the heat release rate perturbation and p' is the pressure fluctuation.&lt;ref&gt;A. A. Putnam and W. C. Dennis (1953) &quot;Organ-pipe oscillations in a flame-filled tube,&quot; ''Fourth Symposium (International) on Combustion'', The Combustion Institute, pp. 566–574.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E. C. Fernandes and M. V. Heitor, [http://books.google.com/books?id=Je_hG6UfnogC&amp;printsec=copyright&amp;dq=rayleigh+thermoacoustic+&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;source=gbs_toc_s&amp;cad=1#PPA4,M1 “Unsteady flames and the Rayleigh criterion”] in F. Culick,  M. V. Heitor, and J. H. Whitelaw, ed.s, ''Unsteady Combustion'' (Dordrecht, the Netherlands:  Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1996), p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;
When the heat release oscillations are in phase with the pressure oscillations, the Rayleigh Index is positive and the magnitude of the thermo acoustic instability increases. On the other hand, if the Rayleigh Index is negative, then thermoacoustic damping occurs. The Rayleigh Criterion implies that a thermoacoustic instability can be optimally controlled by having heat release oscillations 180 degrees out of phase with pressure oscillations at the same frequency. This minimizes the Rayleigh Index.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}

==Rate of Combustion==

Rate of combustion is the amount of mass of a material that goes through combustion over an amount of time. It can be expressed in g/s or kg/s.

The '''Cyrillic alphabet''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|s|ɨ|ˈ|r|ɪ|l|ɪ|k}}) or '''azbuka''' is an alphabetic [[writing system]] developed in the [[First Bulgarian Empire]] during the 10th century AD at the [[Preslav Literary School]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul Cubberley (1996) &quot;The Slavic Alphabets&quot; and later finalized and spread by disciples Kliment and Naum in Ohrid and Preslav schools of Tsar Boris' Bulgaria. In Daniels and Bright, eds. The World's Writing Systems. Oxford University Press. ISBN 0-19-507993-0.&lt;/ref&gt; It is used in various languages, past and present, of Eastern Europe and Asia, especially those of [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] origin, and also non-Slavic languages influenced by Russian.

The alphabet is derived from the [[Greek alphabet|Ancient Greek uncial script]], augmented by [[Typographic ligature|ligature]]s and consonants from the older [[Glagolitic alphabet]] for sounds not found in Ancient Greek. It is named in honor of the two [[Byzantine Greeks|Byzantine Greek]] brothers, [[Saints Cyril and Methodius]], who created the [[Glagolitic alphabet]] earlier on. Modern scholars consider that Cyrillic was developed and formalized by early disciples of Cyril and Methodius (such as [[St Clement of Ohrid|Clement of Ohrid]]).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ohridnews.com/index.php?servis=7wonders&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;http://www.omniglot.com/writing/cyrillic.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

With the [[accession of Bulgaria to the European Union]] on 1 January 2007, Cyrillic became the third official alphabet of the [[European Union]], following the [[Latin alphabet|Latin]] and [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] alphabets.

==Letters==
As the Cyrillic alphabet spread throughout the East and South Slavic territories, it was adopted for writing local languages, such as [[Old East Slavic language|Old East Slavic]]. Its adaptation to the characteristics of local languages led to the development of its many modern variants, below.

Yeri (Ы) was originally a [[ligature (typography)|ligature]] of Yer and I (Ꙑ). [[Iotation]] was indicated by ligatures formed with the letter I: [[Iotated A (Cyrillic)|Ꙗ]] (not ancestor of modern ya, Я, which is derived from Ѧ), {{Unicode|Ѥ}}, Ю (ligature of I and ОУ), {{Unicode|Ѩ}}, {{Unicode|Ѭ}}. Many letters had variant forms and commonly used ligatures, for example И = І = Ї, {{Unicode|Ѡ}} = {{Unicode|Ѻ}}, Оу ⁄ ОУ = {{Unicode|Ѹ}}, {{Unicode|ѠТ}} = {{Unicode|Ѿ}}.

The letters also had numeric values, based not on the native Cyrillic alphabetical order, but inherited from the letters' [[Greek numerals|Greek ancestors]].

The early Cyrillic alphabet is difficult to represent on computers. Many of the letterforms differed from modern Cyrillic, varied a great deal in [[manuscript]]s, and changed over time. Few fonts include adequate [[glyph]]s to reproduce the alphabet. In accordance with [[Unicode]] policy, the standard does not include letterform variations or [[Ligature (typography)|ligatures]] found in manuscript sources unless they can be shown to conform to the Unicode definition of a character.

The Unicode 5.1 standard, released on 4 April 2008, greatly improves computer support for the early Cyrillic and the modern [[Church Slavonic]] language.

==Letterforms and typography==
The development of Cyrillic [[typography]] passed directly from the [[medieval]] stage to the late [[Baroque]], without a [[Renaissance]] phase as in [[Western Europe]]. Late Medieval Cyrillic letters (still found on many [[icon]] inscriptions even today) show a marked tendency to be very tall and narrow; strokes are often shared between adjacent letters.

[[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]], Tsar of Russia, mandated the use of westernized letter forms in the early 18th century. Over time, these were largely adopted in the other languages that use the alphabet. Thus, unlike the majority of modern Greek fonts that retained their own set of design principles for their lower case letters (such as the placement of [[serif]]s, the shapes of stroke ends, and stroke-thickness rules, although Greek capital letters do use Latin design principles), modern Cyrillic fonts are much the same as modern Latin fonts of the same font family. The development of some Cyrillic computer typefaces from Latin ones has also contributed to the visual Latinization of Cyrillic type.

Cyrillic [[Capital letters|uppercase]] and [[Lower case|lowercase]] letterforms are not as differentiated as in Latin typography. Upright Cyrillic lowercase letters are essentially [[small caps|small capitals]] (with exceptions: Cyrillic ‹а, е, р, and у› adopted Western lowercase shapes, lowercase ‹ф› is typically designed under the influence of Latin ‹p›, lowercase ‹б› is a traditional handwritten form), although a good-quality Cyrillic typeface will still include separate small-caps glyphs.&lt;ref&gt;Bringhurst (2002) writes &quot;in Cyrillic, the difference between normal lower case and small caps is more subtle than it is in the Latin or Greek alphabets,...&quot; (p 32) and &quot;in most Cyrillic faces, the lower case is close in color and shape to Latin small caps&quot; (p 107).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Cyrillic upright-cursive.png|frame|right|Comparison of some upright and hand-written letters (Ge, De, I, I kratkoye, Em, Te and Tse. Top row is set in Georgia font, bottom in Kisty CY)]]
Cyrillic fonts, as well as Latin ones, have [[Roman type|roman]] and [[Italic type|italic]] type (practically all popular modern fonts include parallel sets of Latin and Cyrillic letters, where many glyphs, uppercase as well as lowercase, are simply shared by both). However, the native font terminology in Slavic languages (for example, in Russian) does not use the words &quot;roman&quot; and &quot;italic&quot; in this sense.&lt;ref&gt;Name ''ital'yanskiy shrift'' (Italian font) in Russian refers to a particular font family [http://citforum.univ.kiev.ua/open_source/fonts/theory/thumbs/ris320.jpg], whereas ''rimskiy shrift'' (roman font) is just a synonym for Latin font, Latin alphabet.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, the nomenclature follows German naming patterns:

* A roman type is called ''pryamoy shrift'' (&quot;upright type&quot;)—compare with ''Normalschrift'' (&quot;regular type&quot;) in German
* An italic type is called ''kursiv'' (&quot;cursive&quot;) or ''kursivniy shrift'' (&quot;cursive type&quot;)—from the German word ''Kursive'', meaning italic typefaces and not cursive writing
* [[Cursive handwriting]] is ''rukopisniy shrift'' (&quot;hand-written type&quot;) in Russian—in German: ''[[:de:Kurrentschrift|Kurrentschrift]]'' or ''Laufschrift'', both meaning literally ‘running type’

Similarly to Latin fonts, italic and cursive types of many Cyrillic letters (typically lowercase; uppercase only for hand-written or stylish types) are very different from their upright roman types. In certain cases, the correspondence between uppercase and lowercase glyphs does not coincide in Latin and Cyrillic fonts: for example, italic Cyrillic ‹&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: larger&quot;&gt;''т''&lt;/span&gt;› is the lowercase counterpart of ‹''Т''› not of ‹''М''›.

[[Image:Special Cyrillics.png|thumb|The standard Cyrillic letters compared to the ones used in Serbian and Macedonian, in regular shape and italic/cursive]]
As in Latin typography, a [[sans-serif]] face may have a mechanically sloped oblique type (''naklonniy shrift''—&quot;sloped,&quot; or &quot;slanted type&quot;) instead of italic.

A boldfaced type is called ''poluzhirniy shrift'' (&quot;semi-bold type&quot;), because there existed fully boldfaced shapes which are out of use since the beginning of the 20th century.

A bold italic combination (bold slanted) does not exist for all font families.

In Serbian, as well as in Macedonian,&lt;ref&gt;[http://jankojs.tripod.com/SerbianCyr.htm ''Serbian Cyrillic Letters BE, GHE, DE, PE, TE''], Janko Stamenovic (collection of selected commented answers received in Unicode mailing list (unicode@unicode.org) between 29.12.1999 and 17.01.2000).&lt;/ref&gt; some italic and cursive letters are different from those used in other languages. These letter shapes are often used in upright fonts as well, especially for advertisements, road signs, inscriptions, posters and the like, less so in newspapers or books. The Cyrillic lowercase ‹б› has a slightly different design both in the roman and italic types, which is similar to the lowercase Greek letter [[Delta (letter)|Delta]], ‹δ›.

The following table shows the differences between the upright and italic Cyrillic letters as used in Russian. Italic forms significantly different from their roman analogues, or especially confusing to users of the Latin alphabet, are highlighted.

Note: in some fonts or styles lowercase italic Cyrillic ‹д›  (‹''д''›) may look like Latin ‹''g''› and lowercase italic Cyrillic ‹т› (‹''т''›) may look exactly like a capital italic ‹T› (‹''T''›), only small.

{{Main|Cyrillic alphabet variants|Languages using Cyrillic|List of Cyrillic letters|Cyrillic digraphs}}
Among others, Cyrillic is the standard alphabet for writing the following [[national language]]s:

'''Slavic languages''': [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]], [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Rusyn language|Rusyn]], [[Serbo-Croatian]] ([[Serbian language|Serbian]], [[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]] and, sometimes, [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]] standards), and [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]].&lt;br&gt;
'''Non-Slavic languages''': [[Abkhaz language|Abkhaz]], [[Bashkir language|Bashkir]], [[Erzya language|Erzya]], [[Kazakh language|Kazakh]], [[Kildin Sami language|Kildin Sami]], [[Komi language|Komi]], [[Kyrgyz language|Kyrgyz]], [[Mari language|Mari]], [[Moksha language|Moksha]], [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]], [[Ossetic language|Ossetic]], [[Romani orthography|Romani]] (some dialects), [[Tajik language|Tajik]], [[Tatar language|Tatar]], [[Tuvan language|Tuvan]], and [[Udmurt language|Udmurt]].

The Cyrillic alphabet has also been used in the past for languages of [[Eastern Europe]], the [[Caucasus]], [[Siberia]], and the [[Russian Far East]].

The first alphabet partly derived from Cyrillic is [[Abur]], applied to the [[Komi language]]. Other writing systems derived from Cyrillic were applied to Caucasian languages and the [[Molodtsov alphabet]] for [[Komi language]].

==Name==
Since the alphabet was conceived and popularised by the followers of [[Cyril and Methodius]], rather than by Cyril and Methodius themselves, its name does not denote authorship, but rather homage. The name &quot;Cyrillic&quot; often confuses people who are not familiar with the alphabet's history, because it does not identify a country of origin (contrast with &quot;Greek alphabet&quot;). Some call it &quot;Russian alphabet&quot; because Russia is the most populous and influential user of the alphabet. Some Bulgarian intellectuals, notably [[Stefan Tsanev]], have expressed concern over this, and have suggested that the Cyrillic alphabet be called &quot;Bulgarian alphabet&quot; instead, for the sake of historical accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;Tsanev, Stefan. ''Български хроники, том 4 (Bulgarian Chronicles, Volume 4)'', Sofia, 2009, p.165&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cyrillic alphabet is also known as ''azbuka'', derived from the old names of the first two letters of most variant Cyrillic alphabets.

==History==
[[Image:Azbuka 1574 by Ivan Fyodorov.png|left|thumb|A page from Azbuka, the first [[Russia]]n textbook, printed by [[Ivan Fyodorov (printer)|Ivan Fyodorov]] in 1574. This page features the Cyrillic alphabet.]]
{{Main|Early Cyrillic alphabet}}

The Cyrillic alphabet was created in the [[First Bulgarian Empire]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Paul Cubberley 1996&quot;&gt;Paul Cubberley (1996) &quot;The Slavic Alphabets&quot; and later finalized and spread by disciples Kliment and Naum in Ohrid and Preslav schools of Tsar Boris' Bulgaria. In Daniels and Bright, eds. ''The World's Writing Systems.'' Oxford University Press. ISBN 0-19-507993-0.&lt;/ref&gt; and is derived from the [[Greek alphabet|Greek uncial script]], augmented by [[Typographic ligature|ligature]]s and consonants from the older [[Glagolitic alphabet]] for sounds not found in Greek. Tradition holds that Cyrillic and Glagolitic were formalized either by the two [[Greeks|Greek]] brothers born in [[Thessaloniki]], [[Saints Cyril and Methodius]] who brought Christianity to the southern Slavs, or by their disciples.&lt;ref name=&quot;Columbia Encyclopedia 1972, p.846&quot;&gt;''Columbia Encyclopedia'', Sixth Edition. 2001-05, s.v. &quot;Cyril and Methodius, Saints&quot;; ''Encyclopedia Britannica'', Encyclopedia Britannica Incorporated, Warren E.

Cyrillic and [[Glagolitic]] were used for the [[Church Slavonic]] language, especially the [[Old Church Slavonic]] variant. (See [[Early Cyrillic alphabet]].) Hence expressions such as &quot;И is the tenth letter of the Cyrillic alphabet&quot; typically mean the order in Church Slavonic; not every Cyrillic-based language uses every letter of the alphabet.

{{Alphabet}}

The Cyrillic alphabet came to dominate over Glagolitic in the 12th century. The literature produced in the Old Bulgarian language soon began spreading north and became the [[lingua franca]] of Eastern Europe where it came to also be known as [[Old Church Slavonic]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;&quot;On the relationship of old Church Slavonic to the written language of early Rus'&quot; Horace G.

''Indo-European Language and Culture: An Introduction'', p. 374&lt;/ref&gt; The alphabet used for the modern [[Church Slavonic language]] in [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Eastern Catholic]] rites still resembles early Cyrillic. However, over the following ten centuries, the Cyrillic alphabet adapted to changes in spoken language, developed regional variations to suit the features of national languages, and was subjected to academic reforms and political decrees. Today, [[Languages using Cyrillic|dozens of languages]] in Eastern Europe and Asia are written in the Cyrillic alphabet.

==Relationship to other writing systems==
===Latin alphabet===
A number of languages written in the Cyrillic alphabet have also been written in the [[Latin alphabet]], such as [[Serbian language|Serbian]],[[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]], [[Uzbek language|Uzbek]] and [[Romanian Language|Romanian]] (Republic of Moldova only). After the disintegration of the Soviet Union in 1991, official status shifted in some of the former republics from Cyrillic to Latin. The transition is complete in most of Moldova (except [[Transnistria]], where [[Moldovan Cyrillic alphabet|Moldovan Cyrillic]] is official) and Azerbaijan, but Uzbekistan still uses both systems. The [[Russia]]n government has mandated that Cyrillic must be used for all public communications in all [[federal subjects of Russia]], to promote closer ties across the federation{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}. This act was controversial for speakers of many Slavic languages; for many, such as [[Chechen language|Chechen]] and [[Ingush language|Ingush]] speakers, the law had political ramifications. For example, the separatist Chechen government mandated a Latin script (which, in fact, is noted by many observers such as [[Johanna Nichols]] to be a much better representation of the language){{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}, and is still used by many Chechens. Those in the diaspora especially refuse to adopt the Cyrillic alphabet, which they associate with Russian imperialism.

Serbia uses both the Cyrillic and Latin alphabets, but by Article 10 of the Constitution of the Republic of Serbia, the Cyrillic alphabet was made official.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.srbija.gov.rs/cinjenice_o_srbiji/ustav_odredbe.php?id=217&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Zhuang language|Zhuang alphabet]], used between the 1950s and 1980s in portions of the [[People's Republic of China]], used a mixture of Latin, phonetic, numeral-based, and Cyrillic letters. The non-Latin letters, including Cyrillic, were removed from the alphabet in 1982 and replaced with Latin letters that closely resembled the letters they replaced.

===Romanization===
There are various systems for [[Romanization]] of Cyrillic text, including [[transliteration]] to convey Cyrillic spelling in [[Latin]] characters, and [[Transcription (linguistics)|transcription]] to convey [[pronunciation]].

Standard Cyrillic-to-Latin transliteration systems include:
*[[Scientific transliteration]], used in linguistics, is based on the Latin [[Czech alphabet]].
*The [http://www.eki.ee/wgrs/ Working Group on Romanization Systems] of the [[United Nations]] recommends different systems for specific languages. These are the most commonly used around the world.
*[[ISO 9]]:1995, from the International Organization for Standardization.
*American Library Association and Library of Congress Romanization tables for Slavic alphabets ([[ALA-LC Romanization]]), used in North American libraries.
*[[BGN/PCGN Romanization]] (1947), United States Board on Geographic Names &amp; Permanent Committee on Geographical Names for British Official Use).
*[[GOST 16876-71|GOST 16876]], a now defunct Soviet transliteration standard. Replaced by GOST 7.79, which is [[ISO 9]] equivalent.
*[[Volapuk encoding]], an informal rendering of Cyrillic text over Latin-alphabet ASCII.

See also [[Romanization of Belarusian]], [[romanization of Bulgarian|Bulgarian]], [[romanization of Kyrgyz|Kyrgyz]], [[romanization of Russian|Russian]], [[romanization of Macedonian|Macedonian]] and [[romanization of Ukrainian|Ukrainian]].

===Cyrillization===
Representing other writing systems with Cyrillic letters is called [[Cyrillization]].

==Computer encoding==
===Unicode===
{{Further|[[Cyrillic (Unicode block)]]}}

In [[Unicode]] 6.0, letters of the Cyrillic alphabet, including national and historical varieties, are represented by four blocks:

* Cyrillic [http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0400.pdf U+0400&amp;ndash;U+04FF]
* Cyrillic Supplement [http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0500.pdf U+0500&amp;ndash;U+052F]
* Cyrillic Extended-A [http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U2DE0.pdf U+2DE0&amp;ndash;U+2DFF]
* Cyrillic Extended-B [http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/UA640.pdf U+A640&amp;ndash;U+A69F]

The characters in the range U+0400 to U+045F are basically the characters from [[ISO 8859-5]] moved upward by 864 positions. The characters in the range U+0460 to U+0489 are historic letters, not used now. The characters in the range U+048A to U+052F are additional letters for various languages that are written with Cyrillic script.

Unicode as a general rule does not include accented Cyrillic letters. Few exceptions are:
* combinations that are considered as separate letters of respective alphabets, like [[Й]], [[Ў]], [[Ё]], [[Ї]], [[Ѓ]], [[Ќ]] (as well as many letters of non-slavic alphabets);
* two most frequent combinations orthographically required to distinguish [[homonym]]s in Bulgarian and Macedonian: [[Ѐ]], [[Ѝ]];
* few Old and New Church Slavonic combinations: [[Ѷ]], [[Ѿ]], [[Ѽ]].

To indicate stressed or long vowels, [[combining diacritical mark]]s can be used after respective letter (for example, {{unichar|0301|combining acute accent}}: {{unicode|ы́ э́ ю́ я́ }} etc.).

Some languages, including [[Church Slavonic language|Church Slavonic]], are still not fully supported.

Unicode 5.1, released on 4 April 2008, introduces major changes to the Cyrillic blocks. Revisions to the existing Cyrillic blocks, and the addition of Cyrillic Extended A (2DE0...2DFF) and Cyrillic Extended B (A640...A69F), significantly improve support for the [[early Cyrillic alphabet]], [[Abkhaz language|Abkhaz]], [[Aleut language|Aleut]], [[Chuvash language|Chuvash]], [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]], and [[Mordvin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://std.dkuug.dk/jtc1/sc2/wg2/docs/n3194.pdf n3194r-cyrillic&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other===
Punctuation for Cyrillic text is similar to that used in European Latin-alphabet languages.

Other [[character encoding]] systems for Cyrillic:
*[[CP866]] – 8-bit Cyrillic character encoding established by [[Microsoft]] for use in [[MS-DOS]] also known as GOST-alternative. Cyrillic characters go in their native order, with a &quot;window&quot; for pseudographic characters.
*[[ISO/IEC 8859-5]] – 8-bit Cyrillic character encoding established by [[International Organization for Standardization]]
*[[KOI8-R]] – 8-bit native Russian character encoding. Invented in the USSR for use on Soviet clones of American IBM and DEC computers. The Cyrillic characters go in the order of their Latin counterparts, which allowed the text to remain readable after transmission via a 7bit line which removed the senior bit from each byte - the result became a very rough, but readable, Latin transliteration of Cyrillic. Standard encoding of early 90s for UNIX systems and the first Russian Internet encoding.
*[[KOI8-U]] – KOI8-R with addition of Ukrainian letters
*[[MIK Code page|MIK]] – 8-bit native Bulgarian character encoding for use in [[DOS]]
*[[Windows-1251]] – 8-bit Cyrillic character encoding established by Microsoft for use in [[Microsoft Windows]]. The simplest 8bit Cyrillic encoding - 32 capital chars in native order at 0xc0-0xdf, 32 usual chars at 0xe0-0xff, with rarely used &quot;YO&quot; characters somewhere else. No pseudographics. Former standard encoding in some [[Linux]] distributions for Belarusian and Bulgarian, but currently displaced by [[UTF-8]].
*[[GOST-main]]
*[[GB 2312]] - Principally simplified Chinese encodings, but there are also basic 33 Russian Cyrillic letters (in upper- and lower-case).
*[[JIS encoding|JIS]] and [[Shift JIS]] - Principally Japanese encodings, but there are also basic 33 Russian Cyrillic letters (in upper- and lower-case).

===Keyboard layouts===
Each language has its own standard [[keyboard layout]], adopted from [[typewriter]]s. With the flexibility of computer input methods, there are also transliterating or phonetic/homophonic&lt;ref&gt;http://Phonetic.WinRus.com&lt;/ref&gt; keyboard layouts made for typists who are more familiar with other layouts, like the common English [[qwerty keyboard]]. When practical Cyrillic keyboard layouts or fonts are not available, computer users sometimes use transliteration or look-alike &quot;[[volapuk encoding|volapuk]]&quot; encoding to type languages which are normally written with the Cyrillic alphabet.

See [[Keyboard layout#Keyboard layouts for non-Roman alphabetic scripts|Keyboard layouts for non-Roman alphabetic scripts]].
