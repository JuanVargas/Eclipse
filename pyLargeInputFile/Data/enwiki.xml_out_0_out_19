&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lse.ac.uk/collections/VPP/VPPpdf_Wshop2/jflkvdscaen.pdf Approval Voting : An Experiment during the French 2002 Presidential Election], Jean-François Laslier and Karine Vander Straeten, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; showed that approval voting would not have chosen the same two winners
as plurality voting (Chirac and Le Pen) in [[French presidential election, 2002|France's presidential election of 2002]] (first round) - it instead would have chosen Chirac and Jospin as the top two to proceed to a runoff. Le Pen lost by a very high margin in the runoff, 82.2% to 17.8%, a sign that the true top two had not been found. Straight approval voting without a runoff, from the study, still would have selected Chirac, but with an approval percentage of only 36.7%, compared to Jospin at 32.9%. Le Pen, in that study, would have received 25.1%. In the real primary election, the top three were Chirac, 19.9%, Le Pen, 16.9%, and Jospin, 16.2%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rangevoting.org/FrenchStudy.html The French Approval Voting study], Rangevoting.org&lt;/ref&gt;

A generalized version of the [[Burr dilemma]] applies to approval voting when two candidates are appealing to the same subset of voters.  Although approval voting differs from the voting system used in the Burr dilemma, approval voting can still leave candidates and voters with the generalized dilemma of whether to compete or cooperate.&lt;ref&gt;Nagel, J. H. (2007) &quot;The Burr Dilemma in Approval Voting&quot; ''The Journal of Politics'' '''69'''(1): 43-58 [http://www.journalofpolitics.org/files/69_1/Nagel.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nagel, J.H. (2006) [http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/3-540-35605-3_10 &quot;A Strategic Problem in Approval Voting,&quot;] ''Mathematics and Democracy'' pp. 133-150. Studies in Choice and Welfare series (Springer)&lt;/ref&gt;

While in the modern era there have been relatively few competitive approval voting elections where tactical voting is more likely, Brams argues that approval voting usually elects [[Condorcet criterion|Condorcet winners]] in practice.&lt;ref&gt;Steven J. Brams, ''Mathematics and Democracy,'' Princeton University Press, 2008, p. 16, See also [http://www.nyu.edu/gsas/dept/politics/faculty/brams/theory_to_practice.pdf S. Brams and P. Fishburn, ''Going from Theory to Practice: The Mixed Success of Approval Voting''] ([[Portable Document Format|PDF]])&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of the use of approval voting in the alumni elections for the Dartmouth Board of Trustees in 2009 placed its ultimately successful repeal before alumni voters, arguing that the system has not been electing the most centrist candidates. ''The Dartmouth'' editorialized that &quot;When the alumni electorate fails to take advantage of the approval voting process, the three required Alumni Council candidates tend to split the majority vote, giving petition candidates an advantage. By reducing the number of Alumni Council candidates, and instituting a more traditional one-person, one-vote system, trustee elections will become more democratic and will more accurately reflect the desires of our alumni base.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thedartmouth.com/2009/04/03/opinion/verbum/ |title=VERBUM ULTIMUM: Making Amends |publisher=TheDartmouth.com |date=2009-04-03 |accessdate=2010-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Strategic voting ==
=== Sincere voting ===

Approval voting experts describe sincere votes as those &quot;... that directly reflect the true preferences of a voter, i.e. , that do not report preferences 'falsely.'&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;sinceredef&quot;&gt;Brams, Steven and Fishburn, Peter (1983). ''Approval Voting'', Boston: Birkhäuser, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;  They also give a specific definition of a sincere approval vote in terms of the voter's [[preference|ordinal preferences]] as being any vote that, if it votes for one candidate, it also votes for any more preferred candidate.  This definition allows a sincere vote to treat strictly preferred candidates the same, ensuring that every voter has at least one sincere vote. The definition also allows a sincere vote to treat equally preferred candidates differently.  When there are two or more candidates, every voter has at least three sincere approval votes to choose from.  Two of those sincere approval votes do not distinguish between any of the candidates: vote for none of the candidates and vote for all of the candidates.  When there are three or more candidates, every voter has more than one sincere approval vote that distinguishes between the candidates.

==== Examples ====

Based on the definition above, if there are four candidates, A, B, C, and D, and a voter has a strict preference order, preferring A to B to C to D, then the following are the voter's possible sincere approval votes:
:*vote for A, B, C, and D
:*vote for A, B, and C
:*vote for A and B
:*vote for A
:*vote for no candidates

If the voter instead equally prefers B and C, while A is still the most preferred candidate and D is the least preferred candidate, then all of the above votes are sincere and the following combination is also a sincere vote:
:*vote for A and C

The decision between the above ballots is equivalent to deciding an arbitrary &quot;approval cutoff.&quot; All candidates preferred to the cutoff are approved, all candidates less preferred are not approved, and any candidates equal to the cutoff may be approved or not arbitrarily.

=== Strategy with ordinal preferences ===

A sincere voter with multiple options for voting sincerely still has to choose which sincere vote to use. [[tactical voting|Voting strategy]] is a way to make that choice, in which case strategic approval voting includes sincere voting, rather than being an alternative to it.&lt;ref name=probstrat&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.2307/1955800 | author = Niemi, R.G. | year = 1984 | title = The Problem of Strategic Behavior under Approval Voting | journal = American Political Science Review | volume = 78 | issue = 4| pages = 952–958 | jstor = 1955800 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This differs from other voting systems that typically have a unique sincere vote for a voter.

When there are three or more candidates, the winner of an approval voting election can change, depending on which sincere votes are used. In some cases, approval voting can sincerely elect any one of the candidates, including a [[Condorcet winner]] and a [[Condorcet loser]], without the voter preferences changing.  To the extent that electing a Condorcet winner and not electing a Condorcet loser is considered desirable outcomes for a voting system, approval voting can be considered vulnerable to sincere, strategic voting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Yilmaz, M.R. | year = 1999 | title = Can we improve upon approval voting?, | doi = 10.1016/S0176-2680(98)00043-3 | journal = European Journal of Political Economy | volume = 15 | issue = 1| pages = 89–100 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In one sense, conditions where this can happen are robust and are not isolated cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1007/BF00054447 | author = Saari, D.G. and Van Newenhizen, J. | year = 2004 | title = The problem of indeterminancy in approval, multiple, and truncated voting systems | url = | journal = Public Choice | volume = 59 | issue = 2| pages = 101–120 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, the variety of possible outcomes has also been portrayed as a virtue of approval voting, representing the flexibility and responsiveness of approval voting, not just to voter ordinal preferences, but cardinal utilities as well.&lt;ref name=unmitigated&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1007/BF00054449 | author = Saari, D.G. and Van Newenhizen, J. | year = 2004 | title = Is approval voting an ‘unmitigated evil?’ A response to Brams, Fishburn, and Merrill | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/qnw1x486u887t2l5/ | journal = Public Choice | volume = 59 | issue = 2| pages = 133–147 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Dichotomous preferences ====

Approval voting avoids the issue of multiple sincere votes in special cases when voters have dichotomous preferences.  For a voter with dichotomous preferences, approval voting is [[strategy-proof]] (also known as strategy-free).&lt;ref&gt;Brams, Steven and Fishburn, Peter (1983). ''Approval Voting'', Boston: Birkhäuser, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;  When all voters have dichotomous preferences and vote the sincere, strategy-proof vote, approval voting is guaranteed to elect the Condorcet winner, if one exists.&lt;ref&gt;Brams, Steven and Fishburn, Peter (1983). ''Approval Voting'', Boston: Birkhäuser, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;  However, having dichotomous preferences when there are three or more candidates is not typical.  It is an unlikely situation for all voters to have dichotomous preferences when there are more than a few voters.&lt;ref name=probstrat/&gt;

Having dichotomous preferences means that a voter has bi-level preferences for the candidates.  All of the candidates are divided into two groups such that the voter is indifferent between any two candidates in the same group and any candidate in the top-level group is preferred to any candidate in the bottom-level group.&lt;ref&gt;Brams, Steven and Fishburn, Peter (1983). ''Approval Voting'', Boston: Birkhäuser, pp. 16-17&lt;/ref&gt;  A voter that has strict preferences between three candidates—prefers A to B and B to C—does not have dichotomous preferences.

Being strategy-proof for a voter means that there is a unique way for the voter to vote that is a strategically best way to vote, regardless of how others vote.    In approval voting, the strategy-proof vote, if it exists, is a sincere vote.&lt;ref name=&quot;sinceredef&quot;/&gt;

==== Approval threshold ====

Another way to deal with multiple sincere votes is to augment the ordinal preference model with an approval or acceptance threshold.  An approval threshold divides all of the candidates into two sets, those the voter approves of and those the voter does not approve of.  A voter can approve of more than one candidate and still prefer one approved candidate to another approved candidate.  Acceptance thresholds are similar.  With such a threshold, a voter simply votes for every candidate that meets or exceeds the threshold.&lt;ref name=probstrat/&gt;

With threshold voting, it is still possible to not elect the [[Condorcet winner]] and instead elect the [[Condorcet loser]] when they both exist.  However, according to Steven Brams, this represents a strength rather than a weakness of approval voting.  Without providing specifics, he argues that the pragmatic judgements of voters about which candidates are acceptable should take precedence over the [[Condorcet criterion]] and other social choice criteria.&lt;ref name=critstrats&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Brams, S.J. and Remzi Sanver, M. | year = 2005 | title = Critical strategies under approval voting: Who gets ruled in and ruled out, | doi = 10.1016/j.electstud.2005.05.007 | journal = Electoral Studies | volume = 25 | issue = 2| pages = 287–305 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Strategy with cardinal utilities ===

Voting strategy under approval is guided by two competing features of approval voting.  On the one hand, approval voting fails the [[later-no-harm criterion]], so voting for a candidate can cause that candidate to win instead of a more preferred candidate.  On the other hand, approval voting satisfies the [[monotonicity criterion]], so not voting for a candidate can never help that candidate win, but can cause that candidate to lose to a less preferred candidate.  Either way, the voter can risk getting a less preferred election winner.  A voter can balance the risk-benefit trade-offs by considering the voter's cardinal utilities, particularly via the [[von Neumann–Morgenstern utility theorem]], and the probabilities of how others will vote.

A [[Tactical voting#Myerson-Weber strategy|rational voter model]] described by [[Roger Myerson|Myerson]] and Weber specifies an approval voting strategy that votes for those candidates that have a positive prospective rating.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.2307/2938959 | author = Myerson, R. and Weber, R.J. | year = 1993 | title = A theory of Voting Equilibria | jstor = 2938959| journal = American Political Science Review | volume = 87 | issue = 1| pages = 102–114 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This strategy is optimal in the sense that it maximizes the voter's [[Utility#Expected utility|expected utility]], subject to the constraints of the model and provided the number of other voters is sufficiently large.

An optimal approval vote will always vote for the  most preferred candidate and not vote for the least preferred candidate.  However, an optimal vote can require voting for a candidate and not voting for a more preferred candidate if there 4 candidates or more.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Warren [http://www.math.temple.edu/~wds/homepage/newgibbsat.pdf Completion of Gibbard-Satterthwaite impossibility theorem; range voting and voter honesty]. Actually, there are no known examples of such situations for under 6 candidates, and definitely none for 3 candidates; the situation for 4 or 5 candidates is unknown.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other strategies are also available and will coincide with the optimal strategy in special situations.  For example:
* Vote for the candidates that have above average utility.  This strategy coincides with the optimal strategy if the voter thinks that all pairwise ties are equally likely&lt;ref&gt;Brams, Steven and Fishburn, Peter (1983). ''Approval Voting'', Boston: Birkhäuser, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;
* Vote for any candidate that is more preferred than the expected winner and also vote for the expected winner if the expected winner is more preferred than the expected runner-up.  This strategy coincides with the optimal strategy if there are three or fewer candidates or if the pivot probability for a tie between the expected winner and expected runner-up is sufficiently large compared to the other pivot probabilities.
*Vote for the most preferred candidate only.  This strategy coincides with the optimal strategy when there is only one candidate with a positive prospective rating.

Another strategy is to vote for the top half of the candidates, the candidates that have an above-median utility. When the voter thinks that the others will balance their votes randomly and evenly, the strategy will maximize the voter's power or efficacy, meaning that it will maximize the probability that the voter will make a difference in deciding which candidate wins.&lt;ref&gt;Brams, Steven and Fishburn, Peter (1983). ''Approval Voting'', Boston: Birkhäuser, p. 74, 81&lt;/ref&gt;

Optimal strategic approval voting fails to satisfy the [[Condorcet criterion]] and can elect a  [[Condorcet loser criterion|Condorcet loser]].  Strategic approval voting can guarantee electing the [[Condorcet winner]] in some special circumstances.  For example, if all voters are rational and cast a strategically optimal vote based on a common knowledge of how all the other voters vote except for small-probability, statistically independent errors in recording the votes, then the winner will be the Condorcet winner, if one exists.&lt;ref&gt;Laslier, J.-F. (2006) [http://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/docs/00/12/17/51/PDF/stratapproval4.pdf &quot;Strategic approval voting in a large electorate,&quot;] ''IDEP Working Papers'' No. 405 (Marseille, France: Institut D'Economie Publique)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Strategy examples ===

In the example election described [[Condorcet method#An example|here]], assume that the voters in each faction share the following von Neumann-Morgenstern utilities, fitted to the interval between 0 and 100.  The utilities are consistent with the rankings given earlier and reflect a strong preference each faction has for choosing its city, compared to weaker preferences for other factors such as the distance to the other cities.

Using these utilities, voters will choose their optimal strategic votes based on what they think the various pivot probabilities are for pairwise ties.  In each of the scenarios summarized below, all voters share a common set of pivot probabilities.

|}

In the first scenario, voters all choose their votes based on the assumption that all pairwise ties are equally likely.  As a result, they vote for any candidate with an above-average utility.  Most voters vote for only their first choice.  Only the Knoxville faction also votes for its second choice, Chattanooga.  As a result, the winner is Memphis, the Condorcet loser, with Chattanooga coming in second place.

In the second scenario, all of the voters expect that Memphis is the likely winner, that Chattanooga is the likely runner-up, and that the pivot probability for a Memphis-Chattanooga tie is much larger than the pivot probabilities of any other pair-wise ties.  As a result, each voter will vote for any candidate that is more preferred than the leading candidate and will also vote for the leading candidate if that candidate is more preferred than the expected runner-up. Each of the remaining scenarios follows a similar pattern of expectations and voting strategies.

In the second scenario, there is a three-way tie for first place.  This happens because the expected winner, Memphis, was the Condorcet loser and was also ranked last by any voter that did not rank it first.

Only in the last scenario does the actual winner and runner-up match the expected winner and runner-up.  As a result, this can be considered a stable strategic voting scenario. In the language of [[Game Theory]], this is an &quot;equilibrium.&quot;  In this scenario, the winner is also the Condorcet winner.

== Compliance with voting system criteria ==
Most of the mathematical criteria by which voting systems are compared were formulated for voters with ordinal preferences. In this case, approval voting requires voters to make an additional decision of where to put their approval cutoff (see examples above). Depending on how this decision is made, approval voting satisfies different sets of criteria.

There is no ultimate authority on which criteria should be considered, but the following are some criteria that are accepted and considered to be desirable by many voting theorists:
* [[Majority criterion]]—If there exists a majority that ranks (or rates) a single candidate higher than all other candidates, does that candidate always win?
* [[Monotonicity criterion]]—Is it impossible to cause a winning candidate to lose by ranking him higher, or to cause a losing candidate to win by ranking him lower?
* [[Consistency criterion]]—If the electorate is divided in two and a choice wins in both parts, does it always win overall?
* [[Participation criterion]]—Is voting honestly always better than not voting at all? (This is grouped with the distinct but similar Consistency Criterion in the table below.&lt;ref&gt;Consistency implies participation, but not vice versa. For example, range voting complies with participation and consistency, but median ratings satisfies participation and fails consistency.&lt;/ref&gt;)
* [[Condorcet criterion]]—If a candidate beats every other candidate in [[Condorcet method|pairwise comparison]], does that candidate always win? (This implies the majority criterion, above)
* [[Condorcet loser criterion]]—If a candidate loses to every other candidate in pairwise comparison, does that candidate always lose?
* [[Independence of irrelevant alternatives]]—Is the outcome the same after adding or removing non-winning candidates?
* [[Strategic nomination|Independence of clone candidates]]—Is the outcome the same if candidates identical to existing candidates are added?
* [[Reversal symmetry]]—If individual preferences of each voter are inverted, does the original winner never win?

== Other issues and comparisons ==

* Approval voting can allow voters to cast a compromise vote without abandoning their favorite candidate as long as voters accept the potential of that compromise vote resulting in the defeat of their favorite. Plurality voting can lead to voters abandoning their first choice in order to help a &quot;lesser of evils&quot; to win.
* Counting ballots in approval vote is faster than some other alternative voting methods, such as ordinal systems, and can be completed at the local level. Fraudulently adding votes to an approval voting ballot will not invalidate the ballot, however, thereby making secure &quot;chain of custody&quot; of ballots important.
* If voters are sincere, approval voting would elect centrists at least as often as moderates of each extreme. If backers of a relatively extreme candidate are insincere and &quot;bullet vote,&quot; they could help that candidate elect a candidate who would have been a more consensus choice.
* If voters are sincere, candidates trying to win an approval voting election might need to get as much as 100% approval to beat a strong competitor, and would have to find solutions that are fair to everyone in order to do so, whereas a candidate may win a [[plurality]] race by promising many perks to a simple majority or even a plurality of voters at the expense of the smaller voting groups.
* Approval voting fails the [[majority criterion]], because it is possible that the candidate most preferred by the majority of voters, for example, winning 60% in a plurality election, will lose, if 65% indicate another candidate is at least acceptable to them. If 40% strongly dislike candidate A but like candidate B, and 60% mildly prefer candidate A over candidate B, approval voting might elect candidate B, whereas [[plurality]] would elect candidate A in a two candidate race.
* Approval voting without write-ins is easily reversed as [[disapproval voting]] where a choice is disavowed, as is already required in other measures in politics (e.g. representative [[recall election|recall]]).
* Approval voting makes it much easier for voters to vote against an candidate by voting for several others instead of just one other, increasing the probability that some other candidate will win and thus that the first will not.
* In contentious elections with large groups of organized voters who prefer their favorite candidate vastly over all others, approval voting may revert to [[plurality voting]]. Some voters will support only their single favored candidate when they perceive the other candidates more as competitors to their preferred candidate than as compromise choices. [[Range voting]] allows these voters to give intermediate approval ratings, but at the cost of added ballot complexity and longer ballot counts.

== Multiple winners ==

Approval voting can be extended to multiple winner elections.  The naive way to do so is as ''block approval voting'', a simple variant on [[Plurality-at-large voting|block voting]] where each voter can select an unlimited number of candidates and the candidates with the most approval votes win.  This does not provide [[proportional representation]] and is subject to the [[Burr dilemma]], among other problems.

== Ballot types ==

Approval ballots can be of at least four semi-distinct forms. The simplest form is a blank ballot where the names of supported candidates are written in by hand. A more structured ballot will list all the candidates and allow a mark or word to be made by each supported candidate. A more explicit structured ballot can list the candidates and give two choices by each. (Candidate list ballots can include spaces for write-in candidates as well.)

| [[Image:Approvalballotword.png|160px]]
| [[Image:Approvalballotmark.png|160px]]
| [[Image:Approvalballotchoice.png|160px]]
|}

All four ballots are theoretically equivalent. The more structured ballots may aid voters in offering clear votes so they explicitly know all their choices. The Yes/No format can help to detect an &quot;undervote&quot; when a candidate is left unmarked and allow the voter a second chance to confirm the ballot markings are correct. The &quot;single bubble&quot; format is incapable of producing invalid ballots (which might otherwise be rejected in counting).

'''Arizona State University''' ('''ASU''' or '''Arizona State''') is a [[public university|public]] [[research university]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://classifications.carnegiefoundation.org/lookup_listings/view_institution.php?unit_id=104151&amp;start_page=institution.php&amp;clq={&quot;first_letter&quot;:&quot;A&quot;}] The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching. Retrieved August 13, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; located in the [[Phoenix Metropolitan Area]] of the [[Arizona|State of Arizona]].&lt;ref name=oneuniversity&gt;{{cite web |url=http://campus.asu.edu/ |title=ASU – One University in Many Places |publisher= Arizona State University |accessdate=2008-06-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the [[List of United States university campuses by enrollment|largest university in the United States by enrollment]].{{Cref|b}}

Founded in 1885 as the [[Normal School|Tempe Normal School]] for the [[Arizona Territory]], the school came under control of the [[Arizona Board of Regents]] in 1945 and was renamed ''Arizona State College.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asu.edu/about/history/more.html History of ASU] Arizona State University&lt;/ref&gt; A 1958 statewide ballot measure gave the university its present name. 

ASU offers programs in [[liberal arts]], [[engineering]], [[journalism]], [[management]], [[law]], [[nursing]], and [[public policy]]. The university is broadly organized into 14 divisions and is spread across four campuses: the original [[Arizona State University at the Tempe campus|Tempe campus]], the [[Arizona State University at the West campus|West campus]] in northwest [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], the [[Arizona State University at the Polytechnic campus|Polytechnic campus]] in eastern [[Mesa, Arizona|Mesa]], and the [[Arizona State University at the Downtown Phoenix campus|Downtown Phoenix campus]]. All four campuses are accredited as a single institution by the [[Higher Learning Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncahlc.org/index.php?option=com_directory&amp;Itemid=192&amp;Action=ShowBasic&amp;instid=1002 Accreditation status of Arizona State University] Higher Learning Commission&lt;/ref&gt;

ASU's athletic teams compete in [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] and are collectively known as the [[Arizona State Sun Devils]]. They are members of the [[Pacific-10 Conference]] and have won 23 national championships.

==History==
{{Main|History of Arizona State University}}
===1880-1929===
Originally named the ''Tempe Normal School'', the institution was founded on March 12, 1885, after John Samuel Armstrong first introduced House Bill 164, &quot;An Act to Establish a [[Normal school]] in the [[Territory of Arizona]] to the [[13th Arizona Territorial Legislature|13th Legislative Assembly]] of the [[Arizona Territory]]. Instruction was instituted on February 8, 1886 under the supervision of Principal Hiram Bradford Farmer. Land for the school was donated by [[Tempe, Arizona|Tempe]] residents George and Martha Wilson, allowing 33 students to meet in a single room.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asu.edu/about/history/more.html More ASU History]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:ASU mall.jpg|thumb|right|250px|ASU mall from Old Main, 2009]]
At the beginning of the 20th century, the school's name was changed from Tempe Normal School to the ''Normal School of Arizona''. Before becoming a college, the [[Normal School]] enrolled high school students with no other secondary education facilities. Under the 30 year tenure of president Arthur John Matthews the school was given all-college student status. The first dormitories built in the state were constructed under his supervision. Of the 18 buildings constructed while Matthews was president, six are still currently in use. Matthews envisioned an &quot;evergreen campus,&quot; with many shrubbery brought to the campus. He also implemented the planting of [[Palm Walk]], now one of the feature landmarks of the school. His legacy is being continued to this day with the main campus having the honor of being declared a nationally recognized arboretum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asu.edu/fm/arboretum.htm The Arboretum at Arizona State University]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Great Depression]], Ralph W. Swetman was hired as president for a three-year term.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asu.edu/lib/archives/preslist.htm Archives &amp; Special Collections, Principals and Presidents of Arizona State University]&lt;/ref&gt; Although enrollment increased by almost 100% during his tenure due to the depression, many faculty were terminated and faculty salaries were cut.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.asu.edu/lib/archives/asustory/pages/11lead.htm Eighth President Ralph Waldo Swetman 1930–1933]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; 

===1930-1989===
[[Image:FLW Gammage Auditorium ASU PHX AZ 20186.JPG|thumb|250px|left|ASU's [[Gammage Auditorium]], designed by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]]]
In 1933, [[Grady Gammage]], then president of Arizona State Teachers College at [[Flagstaff, Arizona|Flagstaff]], became president of ''Arizona State Teachers College at Tempe'', a tenure that would last for nearly 28 years. Like his predecessor, Gammage oversaw the construction of a number of buildings on the Tempe campus. Dr. Gammage oversaw the development of the university, graduate programs, and the renaming of the ''Arizona State College'' to Arizona State University in 1958.

During the 1960s, with the presidency of Dr. [[G. Homer Durham]], Arizona State University began to expand its academic curriculum by establishing several new colleges and beginning to award [[Doctor of Philosophy]] and other doctoral degrees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asu.edu/lib/archives/asustory/pages/16lead.htm ASU Libraries: The New ASU Story: Leadership]&lt;/ref&gt;

The next three presidents—Harry K. Newburn, 1969–71, John W. Schwada, 1971–81, and J. Russell Nelson, 1981–89—and Interim President Richard Peck, 1989, led the university to increased academic stature, creation of the [[Arizona State University at the West campus|West Campus]], and rising enrollment.

===1990-present===
Under the leadership of Dr. Lattie F. Coor, from 1990 to June 2002, ASU grew to serve the Valley of the Sun through the creation of the [[Arizona State University at the Polytechnic campus|Polytechnic campus]] and extended education sites. His commitment to diversity, quality in [[undergraduate education]], research, and economic development underscored the university's significant gains in each of these areas over his 12-year tenure. Part of Dr. Coor's legacy to the university was a successful fund-raising campaign. Through private donations, primarily from the local community, more than $500 million was invested in targeted areas that significantly impact the future of ASU. Among the campaign's achievements were the naming and endowing of the [[Barrett, The Honors College|Barrett Honors College]], the [[Herberger College of the Arts|Katherine K. Herberger College of Fine Arts]], and the Morrison School of Agribusiness and Resource Management at the Polytechnic campus; the creation of many new endowed faculty positions; and hundreds of new scholarships and fellowships.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asu.edu/lib/archives/asustory/pages/21lead.htm ASU Libraries: The New ASU Story: Leadership]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Asu campus 1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Overlooking campus from atop [[Hayden Butte]]]]
On July 1, 2002, [[Michael Crow]] became the university's 16th president. At his inauguration, President Crow outlined his vision for transforming ASU into a &quot;New American University&quot;—one that would be open and inclusive. As the only [[research university]] serving the metropolitan Phoenix area (and one of only two in Arizona), Crow stated that ASU is in a unique position to evolve together with the city into one of the great intellectual institutions in the world. Further, Crow initiated the idea of transforming ASU into &quot;One University in Many Places&quot; by merging ASU's several campuses into a single institution, sharing students, faculty, staff and accreditation.

Under Crow's leadership, and aided by hundreds of millions of dollars in donations, ASU embarked on an aggressive years-long research facility capital building effort, resulting in the completion of the [[Biodesign Institute]] and several large interdisciplinary research buildings. Along with the research facilities, the university faculty was expanded, including the addition of three [[Nobel Laureates]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://asunews.asu.edu/20091012_ostrom_nobel Nobel Prize Winners] ASU News&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, ASU's [[Arizona State University at the Downtown Phoenix campus|Downtown Phoenix]] campus was vastly expanded. Several of the University's colleges and schools were relocated to the downtown campus, and new programs, such as a biomedical collaboration with the [[University of Arizona]] were established in downtown Phoenix.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asu.edu/news/research/biomed_pressconf_082704.htm ASU, UA join forces on biomedical campus plan&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Late-2000s recession|economic downturn]] that began in 2008 took a particularly hard toll on Arizona, resulting in large cuts to ASU's budget.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azcentral.com/news/articles/2009/01/16/20090116capitol-budget0116.html Budget Cuts Proposal] Arizona Republic&lt;/ref&gt; In response to these cuts, ASU underwent several rounds of reorganizations,&lt;ref&gt;[http://asunews.asu.edu/20090121_reorg Academic Reorganization]&lt;/ref&gt; combining academic departments, consolidating colleges and schools, and reducing university staff and administrators.

==Campuses==
ASU describes itself as &quot;one university in many places&quot;, meaning that it is not a system with separate campuses, and not one main campus with branch campuses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://campus.asu.edu One University in Many Places] Arizona State University&lt;/ref&gt;}} ASU's colleges, schools, and departments are spread across four campuses, with each campus hosting a unique set of colleges and schools, and offering both [[undergraduate]] and [[graduate education|graduate]] programs.&lt;ref name = &quot;xvjbbz&quot;&gt;[http://www.asu.edu/provost/about/oneuniversity.html One University in Many Places] Explanation of the ASU campus organization&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the physical campuses, ASU includes a fifth &quot;virtual campus&quot; for [[online education|online]] and extended education.

===Tempe campus===
[[Image:Asuhayden.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The subterranean entrance to Hayden Library, Tempe campus]]
{{Main|Arizona State University at the Tempe campus}}
ASU's Tempe campus is located in downtown [[Tempe, Arizona]], about eight miles (13&amp;nbsp;km) east of downtown Phoenix. The campus is considered urban, and is approximately {{convert|642|acre|km2|1}} in size. The campus is arranged around broad pedestrian malls and is completely encompassed by an arboretum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asu.edu/asuwebrw/entrance/tempe/ ASU's Tempe campus]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azarboretum.org/ Arizona Arboretums And Botanical Gardens]&lt;/ref&gt; The Tempe campus is also the largest of ASU's campuses, with 58,371{{Cref|a}} students enrolled in its programs.&lt;ref name=enroll10&gt;[http://asunews.asu.edu/20100909_enrollment ASU Enrollment]. 2010. Retrieved Sep 10, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tempe campus is ASU's original campus, and [[Old Main (Arizona State University)|Old Main]], the first building constructed, still stands today. There are many notable landmarks on campus, including [[Grady Gammage Memorial Auditorium]], designed by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], Palm Walk, which is lined by 111 palm trees,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vpsa.asu.edu/UGA/360/campus.asp?campusid=1 Arizona State University: Virtual Tour]&lt;/ref&gt; Charles Trumbull Hayden Library, the University Club Building, and University Bridge. In addition, the campus has an extensive public art collection, considered one of the ten best among university public art collections in America according to ''Public Art Review''.&lt;ref name=&quot;PAR&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|date=Spring/Summer 2006|title=Big Ten|journal=Public Art Review|volume=17|issue=2|pages=24–5|issn=1040-211X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Against the northwest edge of campus is the Mill Avenue district (part of [[Tempe, Arizona|downtown Tempe]]) which has a college atmosphere that attracts many students to its restaurants and bars. The Tempe campus is also home to all of the university's athletic facilities.

===West campus===

Herrera]] [[U.S. Army Reserve]] Center and the [[Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport]].

===Downtown Phoenix campus===
[[Image:ASUDowntown1.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The Walter Cronkite School of Journalism, Downtown Phoenix campus]]
{{Main|Arizona State University at the Downtown Phoenix campus}}
The newest of ASU's four campuses, the Downtown Phoenix campus was established in 2006 on the north side of [[Downtown Phoenix]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asu.edu/downtownphoenix/academics/colleges-schools.html ASU]&lt;/ref&gt; The campus has an [[urban design]], with several large modern academic buildings intermingled with commercial and retail office buildings. In addition to the new buildings, the campus included the [[adaptive reuse]] of several existing structures, including a 1930's era Post Office that is on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].

Initially, the campus housed the colleges of Nursing and [[ASU College of Public Programs|Public Programs]]. In 2008 The [[Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication]] moved to the campus, followed by the Public Television station [[KAET]] in 2009. As of the fall 2010 semester, 13,567{{Cref|a}} students were enrolled in a course at this campus.&lt;ref name=enroll10/&gt; In fall of 2009 the School of Public Programs added the School of Criminology and Criminal Justice, the Department of Recreation and Tourism Management and the Department of Social Work, all formerly part of the College of Human Services.&lt;ref&gt;[http://copp.asu.edu/college-news/college-embraces-new-school-and-departments College embraces new school and departments — College of Public Programs&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colleges @ ASU===
In response to demands for lower-cost public higher education in Arizona, ASU is developing a number of small, undergraduate-only college campuses throughout Arizona. These campuses will be teaching-focused, and will provide a selection of popular undergraduate majors. The first two of these campuses are being planned for [[Payson, Arizona]] and [[Lake Havasu City, Arizona]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/local/articles/2010/09/27/20100927asu-payson-college-site.html Colleges @ ASU in Payson] [[Arizona Republic]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Online and Extended Education===
ASU offers 30 undergraduate and graduate degree programs through an entirely [[online education|online]] program, known as ASU Online. The degree programs delivered online hold the same accreditation as the university's traditional face-to-face programs, and students earn the same degree as those who attended courses in person. As of spring 2009, more than 2,000 students were enrolled at ASU Online. ASU Online is headquartered at ASU's [[Skysong, the ASU Scottsdale Innovation Center|Skysong]] campus in [[Scottsdale]], Arizona.

==Academics==
===Admissions===
To ensure college access to all Arizona residents, the three public Arizona universities have relatively liberal admission standards. In 2009–2010, ASU admitted 90% of its applicants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nces.ed.gov/collegenavigator/?s=AZ&amp;ct=1&amp;id=104151 Arizona State University] US Department of Education IPEDS&lt;/ref&gt; Admission is ensured to Arizona residents in the top 25% of their high-school class with at a weighted secondary GPA of 2.5 GPA, or anyone with 24 credits of community college work with a 2.0 GPA minimum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abor.asu.edu/3_for_students/admin_stds.html Tri-University Admission Standards] Arizona Board of Regents&lt;/ref&gt; As of Fall 2008, the average first time freshman SAT/ACT scores were 1082 and 23.5, respectively.

===Student media===
ASU Student Media- ''The [[State Press]]'' (student newspaper &amp; online publication) is a daily paper published on Monday through Friday during the fall and spring semesters, and weekly during the summer sessions. The online publication can be seen at www.statepress.com. The multimedia department works with the staff of the newspaper to create the online content. This content includes video and audio slideshows paired with the print articles to create a more dynamic, multi-faceted storytelling experience. This cutting-edge integration began in the Fall of 2010. Student editors and managers are solely responsible for the content of all Student Media products. They are overseen by an independent board and guided by a professional adviser employed by the University.

During the fall and spring semesters 13,500 copies of the State Press are printed each week day. 

The campus has two radio stations. [[KASC]] The Blaze 1330 AM, is a broadcast station and is not an official part of Student Media – it is owned and funded by the Cronkite School – but is completely student-run save for a faculty and professional adviser. The Blaze broadcasts local, alternative and independent music 24 hours a day, and also features news and sports updates at the top and bottom of every hour.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blazeradioonline.com/ kasc – the blaze 1330 am – asu's original alternative]&lt;/ref&gt; [[W7ASU]] is an [[amateur radio]] station that was first organized in 1935.

Members and officers of ASASU are elected annually by the student body.

The [[Residence Hall Association]] (RHA) of Arizona State University is the student government for every ASU student living on-campus. Each ASU campus has an RHA that operates independently of each other. The purpose of RHA is to enhance the quality of residence hall life and provide a cohesive voice for the residents by addressing the concerns of the on-campus populations to university administrators and other campus organizations; providing cultural, diversity, educational, and social programming; establishing and working with individual hall councils.

'''Astoria''' is a city in and the [[county seat]] of [[Clatsop County, Oregon|Clatsop County]], [[Oregon]], [[United States]].{{GR|6}} Situated near the mouth of the [[Columbia River]], the city was named after the American investor (and first millionaire) [[John Jacob Astor]]. His [[American Fur Company]] founded [[Fort Astoria]] at the site in 1811. Astoria was incorporated by the [[Oregon Legislative Assembly]] on October 20, 1876.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Leeds|first=W. H.|year=1899|title=Special Laws|journal=The State of Oregon General and Special Laws and Joint Resolutions and Memorials Enacted and Adopted by the Twentieth Regular Session of the Legislative Assembly|publisher=State Printer|location=Salem, Oregon|page=747|url=http://books.google.com/?id=gsCwAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=%22ocean%20grove%22%20seaside%20oregon&amp;pg=PA747}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Located on the south shore of the Columbia, the city is served by the Port of Astoria with a deep-water port. Transportation includes the [[Astoria Regional Airport]] with [[U.S. Route 30 in Oregon|U.S. Route 30]] and [[U.S. Route 101 in Oregon|U.S. Route 101]] as the main highways, and the 4.2 mile [[Astoria – Megler Bridge]] connecting to neighboring [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] across the river. The population was 9,813 at the [[2000 United States Census|2000 census]]. As of 2007, the state estimates that the city has 10,045 residents.&lt;ref name=&quot;psu&quot;&gt;[http://www.pdx.edu/media/p/r/prcCertifiedRelease_07_web_cities.pdf PSU:Population Research Center]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Early view of Astoria, Oregon.jpg|left|thumb|The Methodist Mission at Astoria in 1841]]
[[File:View of Astoria, Oregon.jpg|thumb|View of Astoria in 1868]]
[[File:Astoria bridge.jpg|thumb|[[Astoria – Megler Bridge]]]]
The [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]] spent the winter of 1805–1806 at [[Fort Clatsop]], a small log structure south and west of modern day Astoria. The expedition had hoped a ship would come by to take them back east, but instead endured a torturous winter of rain and cold, then returned east the way they came. Today the fort has been recreated and is now a [[U.S. National Monument|national monument]].

In 1810, John Jacob Astor's [[Pacific Fur Company]] sent the [[Astor Expedition]] that founded [[Fort Astoria]] as its primary fur-trading post in the Northwest, and in fact the first permanent U.S. settlement on the Pacific coast. It was an extremely important post for American exploration of the continent and was influential in establishing American claims to the land. Fort Astoria was constructed in 1811.

British explorer [[David Thompson (explorer)|David Thompson]] was the first European to navigate the entire length of the [[Columbia River]] in 1811. Thompson reached the partially constructed Fort Astoria at the mouth of the Columbia, arriving two months after the Pacific Fur Company's ship, the ''[[Tonquin]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Meinig |first= D.W. |authorlink= D.W. Meinig |title= The Great Columbia Plain |origyear= 1968 |edition= Weyerhaeuser Environmental Classic |year= 1995 |publisher= University of Washington Press |isbn= 0-295-97485-0 |pages= 37–38, 50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pacific Fur Company failed, however, and the fort and fur trade were sold to the British in 1813. The house was restored to the U.S. in 1818, though the fur trade would remain under British control until American pioneers following the [[Oregon Trail]] began filtering into the port town in the mid-1840s. The [[Treaty of 1818]] established joint U.S. – British occupancy of territory west of the [[continental divide]] to the Pacific Ocean. In 1846 the [[Oregon Treaty]] ended the [[Oregon Boundary Dispute]]; with Britain ceding all right to the mainland south of the [[49th parallel north]].

[[Washington Irving]], a prominent American writer with a European reputation, was approached by John Jacob Astor to mythologize the three-year reign of his Pacific Fur Company. ''Astoria'' (1835), written while Irving was Astor's guest, cemented the importance of the region in the American psyche.&lt;ref&gt;In his Introduction to the rambling work, Irving reports that Astor explicitly &quot;expressed a regret that the true nature and extent of his enterprize&lt;!--enterprize in original--&gt;and its national character and importance had never been understood.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; In Irving's words, the fur traders were &quot;Sinbads of the wilderness&quot;, and their venture was a staging point for the spread of American economic power into both the continental interior and into the Pacific.

As the [[Oregon Territory]] grew and became increasingly more settled, Astoria likewise grew as a [[port|port city]] at the mouth of the great river that provided the easiest access to the interior. The first U.S. Post Office west of the [[Rocky Mountains]] was established in Astoria in 1847. In 1876, the community was incorporated by the state.

Astoria attracted a host of immigrants beginning in the late-19th century: [[Nordic countries|Scandinavia]]n settlers, primarily Finns, and Chinese soon became significant parts of the population. The Finns mostly lived in Uniontown, near the present-day end of the Astoria-Megler Bridge, and took fishing jobs; the Chinese tended to do cannery work, and usually lived either downtown or in bunkhouses near the canneries. In 1883, and again in 1922, downtown Astoria was devastated by fire, partly because it was mostly wood and entirely raised off the marshy ground on pilings. Even after the first fire, the same format was used, and the second time around the flames spread quickly again, as collapsing streets took out the water system. Frantic citizens resorted to dynamite, blowing up entire buildings to stop the fire from going further.

Astoria has served as a port of entry for over a century and remains the trading center for the lower Columbia basin, although it has long since been eclipsed by [[Portland, Oregon]] and [[Seattle|Seattle, Washington]] as an economic hub on the coast of the [[Pacific Northwest]]. Astoria's economy centered on fishing, fish processing, and lumber. In 1945, about 30 canneries could be found along the Columbia; however, in 1974 [[Bumble Bee (brand)|Bumblebee Seafood]] moved its headquarters out of Astoria, and gradually reduced its presence until 1980 when the company closed its last Astoria cannery. The [[timber industry]] likewise declined; Astoria Plywood Mill, the city's largest employer, closed in 1989, and the [[Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway]] discontinued service in 1996.

From 1921 to 1966, a [[Astoria-Megler Ferry|ferry route across the Columbia River]] connected Astoria with [[Pacific County, Washington]].  In 1966 the [[Astoria-Megler Bridge]] was opened; it completed [[U.S. Route 101]] and linked Astoria with [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] on the opposite shore of the Columbia, and replaced the ferries.

Today, tourism, Astoria's growing art scene, and light manufacturing are the main economic activities of the city. It is a port of call for [[cruise ship]]s since 1982, after $10 million in pier improvements to accommodate cruise ships. To avoid Mexican ports of call during the [[2009 flu pandemic|Swine Flu outbreak of 2009]], many cruises were re-routed to include Astoria. The residential community [[The World (cruise ship)|''The World'']] visited Astoria in June 2009.

In addition to the replicated [[Fort Clatsop]], a popular point of interest is the [[Astoria Column]], a tower {{convert|125|ft|m}} high built atop the hill above the town, with an inner circular staircase allowing visitors to climb to see a panoramic view of the town, the surrounding lands, and the Columbia flowing into the Pacific. The column was built by the [[Astor family]] in 1926 to commemorate the region's early history.

Since 1998, artistically-inclined fishermen and women from Alaska and the Pacific Northwest have traveled to Astoria for the [[Fisher Poets Gathering]], where poets and singers tell their tales to honor the fishing industry and lifestyle.

Astoria is also the western terminus of the TransAmerica Trail, a [[bicycle touring]] route created by the [[American Cycling Association]].

==Geography and climate==
According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|10.6|sqmi|km2}}, of which {{convert|6.1|sqmi|km2|1}} is land and {{convert|4.5|sqmi|km2|1}} (42.18%) is water.

===Climate===
Astoria lies within the [[Marine west coast climate]] zone ([[Köppen climate classification|Koppen]] ''Cfb''), with very mild temperatures year-round, some of the most consistent in the [[continental United States]]; winters are mild for Astoria's [[latitude]], generally above freezing even at night, and wet. Summers are cool, although short heat waves can occur. Rainfall is most abundant in late fall and winter, and lightest in mid-late summer. Snowfall is relatively rare but can accumulate in small amounts in winter.

Annually, there is an average of only 0.5 day with maximum temperatures of {{convert|90|F|C}} or higher. There are an average of 34.3 days with minimum temperatures of {{convert|32|F|C}} or lower. The record high temperature was {{convert|101|F|C}} on July 1, 1942. The record low temperature was {{convert|6|F|C}} on December 8, 1972.

There are an average of 194 days with measurable precipitation. The wettest year was 1950 with {{convert|113.34|in|mm}} and the driest year was 1985 with {{convert|41.58|in|mm}}. The most rainfall in one month was {{convert|36.07|in|mm}} in December 1933. The most rainfall in 24 hours was {{convert|5.56|in|mm}} on November 25, 1998. The most snowfall in one month was {{convert|26.9|in|mm}} in January 1950.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/cgi-bin/cliMAIN.pl?or0324; http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/cgi-bin/cliMAIN.pl?or0328&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''''Alarums and Excursions''''' ('''''A&amp;E'''''), is an [[amateur press association]] started in June 1975 by [[Lee Gold]] (at the request of [[Bruce Pelz]], who felt that discussion of ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'' was taking up too much space in Apa-L, the APA of the [[Los Angeles Science Fantasy Society]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arielarchives.com/Brett/magazines/alarumsandexcursions.html Bretts RPG Magazine and Zine Index], entry on Alarums &amp; Excursions, retrieved September 2007&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first publication to focus solely on [[role-playing game]]s. 

Each issue is a collection of contributions from different authors, often featuring game design discussions, rules variants, write-ups of game sessions, reviews, and comments on others contributions. It was a four-time winner of the [[Charles Roberts Award|Charles Roberts]]/[[Origins Award]], winning &quot;Best Amateur Adventure Gaming Magazine&quot; in 1984,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.originsgamefair.com/awards/1984 The Charles Roberts Awards 1984], retrieved September 2007&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Best Amateur Game Magazine&quot; in 1999,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.originsgamefair.com/awards/1999 Origins Awards 1999], retrieved September 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;Best Amateur Game Periodical&quot; in 2000&lt;ref name = &quot;hbdhyg&quot;&gt;[http://www.originsgamefair.com/awards/2000 Origins Awards 2000], retrieved September 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and 2001.&lt;ref name = &quot;hbdhyg&quot;/&gt;

Although game reports and social reactions are common parts of many ''A&amp;E'' contributions, it has also, over the years, become a testing ground for new ideas on the development of the RPG as a genre and an art form. The idea that role-playing games ''are'' an art form took strong root in this zine, and left a lasting impression on many of the RPG professionals who contributed.

{{French literature (small)}}

'''Alfred Jarry''' (8 September 1873 &amp;ndash; 1 November 1907) was a [[France|French]] [[writer]] born in [[Laval, Mayenne|Laval]], [[Mayenne]], [[France]], not far from the border of [[Brittany]]; he was of [[Brittany|Breton]] descent on his mother's side. 

Best known for his [[Play (theatre)|play]] ''[[Ubu Roi]]'' (1896), which is often cited as a forerunner to the [[Surrealism|surrealist]] theatre of the 1920s and 1930s, Jarry  wrote in a variety of genres and styles. He wrote plays, novels, poetry, essays and speculative journalism. His texts present some pioneering work in the field of absurdist literature. Sometimes grotesque or misunderstood (e.g. the opening line in his play ''Ubu Roi'', &quot;Merdre!&quot;, has been translated into English as &quot;Pshit!&quot;, &quot;Shitteth!&quot;, &quot;Shittr!&quot;, &quot;Shikt!&quot;, &quot;Shrit!&quot;, &quot;Pschitt!&quot;, and &quot;Shitsky!&quot;), he invented a [[pseudoscience]] called ''[['Pataphysics]]''.

==Biography and works==
A precociously brilliant student, Jarry enthralled his classmates with a gift for pranks and troublemaking.

At the lycée in [[Rennes]] when he was 15, he led of a group of boys who devoted much time and energy to poking fun at their well-meaning, but obese and incompetent physics teacher, a man named Hébert. Jarry and classmate Henri Morin wrote a play they called ''Les Polonais'' and performed it with [[marionettes]] in the home of one of their friends. The main character, ''Père Heb'', was a blunderer with a huge belly; three teeth (one of stone, one of iron, and one of wood); a single, retractable ear; and a misshapen body. In Jarry's later work ''[[Ubu Roi]]'', Père Heb would develop into Ubu, one of the most monstrous and astonishing characters in French literature.

At 17 Jarry passed his [[baccalauréat]] and moved to [[Paris]] to prepare for admission to the École Normale Supérieure. Though he was not admitted, he soon gained attention for his original poems and prose-poems. A collection of his work, ''Les minutes de sable mémorial'', was published in 1893.

That same year, both his parents died, leaving him a small inheritance which he quickly spent.

Jarry had meantime discovered the pleasures of alcohol, which he called &quot;my sacred herb&quot; or, when referring to [[absinthe]], the &quot;green goddess&quot;. A story is told that he once painted his face green and rode through town on his bicycle in its honour (and possibly under its influence).

When he was drafted into the army in 1894, his gift for turning notions upside down defeated attempts to instill military discipline. The sight of the small man in a uniform much too large for his less than 5-foot frame&amp;mdash;the army did not issue uniforms small enough&amp;mdash;was so disruptively funny that he was excused from parades and marching drills. Eventually the army discharged him for medical reasons. His military experience eventually inspired the novel ''Days and Nights''.

Jarry returned to Paris and applied himself to drinking, writing, and the company of friends who appreciated his witty, sweet-tempered, and unpredictable conversation. This period is marked by his intense involvement with [[Remy de Gourmont]] in the publication of  ''[[L'Ymagier]]'', a luxuriously produced &quot;art&quot; magazine devoted to the symbolic analysis of medieval and popular prints. [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]] as an art movement was in full swing at this time and ''L'Ymagier'' provided a nexus for many of its key contributors. Jarry's  play ''Caesar Antichrist'' (1895) drew on this movement for material. This is a work that bridges the gap between serious symbolic meaning and the type of critical absurdity with which Jarry would soon become associated. Using the biblical [[Book of Revelation]] as a point of departure, ''Caesar Antichrist'' presents a parallel world of extreme formal symbolism in which [[Jesus|Christ]] is resurrected not as an agent of [[spirituality]] but as an agent of the [[Roman Empire]] that seeks to dominate spirituality. It is a unique [[narrative]] that effectively links the domination of the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] to contemporaneous advances in the field of [[Egyptology]] such as the 1894 excavation of the [[Narmer Palette]], an ancient artifact used for situating the [[rebus]] within [[hermeneutics]].

The spring of 1896 saw the publication, in Paul Fort's review ''Le Livre d'art'', of Jarry's 5-act play ''[[Ubu Roi]]''&amp;mdash;the rewritten and expanded ''Les Polonais'' of his school days. ''Ubu Roi'''s savage humor and monstrous absurdity, unlike anything thus far performed in French theater, seemed unlikely to ever actually be performed on stage. However, impetuous theater director [[Aurélien-Marie Lugné-Poe]] took the risk, producing the play at his Théâtre de l'Oeuvre.
[[File:Ubu-Jarry.png|thumb|left|Père Ubu (later:Ubu Roi), from a drawing of Alfred Jarry]]
On opening night (10 December 1896), with traditionalists and the [[avant-garde]] in the audience, King Ubu (played by [[Firmin Gémier]]) stepped forward and intoned the opening word, &quot;Merdre!&quot; (&quot;Shittr!&quot;). A quarter of an hour of pandemonium ensued: outraged cries, booing, and whistling by the offended parties, countered by cheers and applause by the more forward-thinking contingent. Such interruptions continued through the evening. At the time, only the dress rehearsal and opening night performance were held, and the play was not revived until 1907.

The play brought fame to the 23-year-old Jarry, and he immersed himself in the fiction he had created. Gémier had modeled his portrayal of Ubu on Jarry's own staccato, nasal vocal delivery, which emphasized each syllable (even the silent ones). From then on, Jarry would always speak in this style. He adopted Ubu's ridiculous and pedantic figures of speech; for example, he referred to himself using the [[royal we|royal ''we'']], and called the wind &quot;that which blows&quot; and the bicycle he rode everywhere &quot;that which rolls&quot;.

Jarry moved into a flat which the landlord had created through the unusual expedient of subdividing a larger flat by means of a horizontal rather than a vertical partition. The diminutive Jarry could just manage to stand up in the place, but guests had to bend or crouch. Jarry also took to carrying a loaded pistol. In response to a neighbor's complaint that his target shooting endangered her children, he replied, &quot;If that should ever happen, ma-da-me, we should ourselves be happy to get new ones with you&quot; (though he was not at all inclined to engage with females in the manner implied).

With [[Franc-Nohain]] and [[Claude Terrasse]], he co-founded the [[Théatre des Pantins]], which in 1898 was the site of marionette performances of ''Ubu Roi''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.schubertiademusic.com/details/multiple_catalogs:yes/desc:Bonnard,+Pierre.+(1867+-+1947)%3B+Terrasse,+Claude.+(1867+-+1923)%3B+Jarry,+Alfred.+(1873+-+1907) PADA]&lt;/ref&gt;

Living in worsening poverty, neglecting his health, and drinking excessively, Jarry went on to write what is often cited as the first [[cyborg]] sex novel, ''Le Surmâle'' (''[[Supermale (novel)|The Supermale]]''), which is partly a satire on the [[symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] ideal of self-transcendence.

Unpublished until after his death, his fiction ''[[Exploits and Opinions of Dr. Faustroll, pataphysician]]'' (''Gestes et opinions du docteur Faustroll, pataphysicien'') describes the exploits and teachings of a sort of antiphilosopher who, born at age 63, travels through a hallucinatory Paris in a sieve and subscribes to the tenets of ''[['pataphysics]]''. 'Pataphysics deals with &quot;the laws which govern exceptions and will explain the universe supplementary to this one&quot;. In 'pataphysics, every event in the universe is accepted as an extraordinary event.

Jarry once wrote, expressing some of the bizarre logic of 'pataphysics, &quot;If you let a coin fall and it falls, the next time it is just by an infinite coincidence that it will fall again the same way; hundreds of other coins on other hands will follow this pattern in an infinitely unimaginable fashion&quot;.

In his final years, he was a legendary and heroic figure to some of the young writers and artists in Paris. [[Guillaume Apollinaire]], [[André Salmon]], and [[Max Jacob]] sought him out in his truncated apartment. After his death, [[Pablo Picasso]], fascinated with Jarry, acquired his pistol and wore it on his nocturnal expeditions in Paris, and later bought many of his manuscripts as well as executing a fine drawing of him.

Jarry lived in his 'pataphysical world until his death in Paris on 1 November 1907 of [[tuberculosis]], aggravated by drug and alcohol use. It is recorded that his last request was for a toothpick. He was interred in the [[Cimetière de Bagneux]], near Paris.

'''Amalric I of Jerusalem''' (also '''Amaury''' or '''Aimery''') (1136 &amp;ndash; 11 July 1174) was [[Kingdom of Jerusalem|King of Jerusalem]] 1163&amp;ndash;1174, and [[Count of Jaffa and Ascalon]] before his accession. Amalric was the second son of [[Melisende of Jerusalem]] and [[Fulk of Jerusalem]]. He was the father of three rulers of Jerusalem, the eldest [[Sibylla of Jerusalem|Sibylla]], the second [[Baldwin IV of Jerusalem|Baldwin IV]] and then [[Isabella I of Jerusalem|Isabella I]], who ruled after the Siege. He was also the father of two other children. One, with his first wife [[Agnes of Courtenay|Agnes de Courtenay]], a child named Alix, who suffered an infant death, and the other with his second wife [[Maria Komnene, Queen of Jerusalem|Maria Comnena]], a stillborn.

==Youth==
After the death of Amalric's father, the throne passed jointly to his mother Melisende and his older brother [[Baldwin III of Jerusalem|Baldwin III]]. Melisende did not step down when Baldwin came of age, and by 1150 the two were becoming increasingly hostile towards each other. In 1152 Baldwin had himself crowned sole king, and civil war broke out, with Melisende retaining [[Jerusalem]] while Baldwin held territory further north. Amalric, who had been given the [[County of Jaffa]] as an [[apanage]] when he reached the age of majority in 1151, remained loyal to Melisende in Jerusalem, and when Baldwin invaded the south, Amalric was besieged in the [[Tower of David]] with his mother. Melisende was defeated in this struggle and Baldwin ruled alone thereafter. In 1153 Baldwin captured the [[Egypt]]ian fortress of [[Ashkelon|Ascalon]], which was then added to Amalric's fief of Jaffa (see [[Battle of Ascalon (1153)|Battle of Ascalon]]).

Amalric married [[Agnes of Courtenay]] in 1157. Agnes, daughter of [[Joscelin II of Edessa]], had lived in Jerusalem since the western regions of [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]] were lost in 1150. [[Patriarch Fulk of Jerusalem|Patriarch Fulcher]] objected to the marriage on grounds of [[consanguinity]], as the two shared a great-great-grandfather, [[Guy I of Montlhéry]], and it seems that they waited until Fulcher's death to marry. Agnes bore Amalric three children:  [[Sibylla of Jerusalem|Sibylla]], the future [[Baldwin IV of Jerusalem|Baldwin IV]] (both would come to rule the kingdom in their own right), and Alix, who died in childhood.

==Succession==
Baldwin III died on 10th February 1163 and the kingdom passed to Amalric, although there was some opposition among the nobility to Agnes; they were willing to accept the marriage in 1157 when Baldwin III was still capable of siring an heir, but now the ''[[Haute Cour of Jerusalem|Haute Cour]]'' refused to endorse Amalric as king unless his marriage to Agnes was annulled. The hostility to Agnes, it must be admitted, may be exaggerated by the chronicler [[William of Tyre]], whom she prevented from becoming [[Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem]] decades later, as well as from William's continuators like [[Ernoul]], who hints at a slight on her moral character: &quot;car telle n'est que roine doie iestre di si haute cite comme de Jherusalem&quot; (&quot;there should not be such a queen for so holy a city as Jerusalem&quot;). Nevertheless, consanguinity was enough for the opposition. Amalric agreed and ascended the throne without a wife, although Agnes continued to hold the title Countess of Jaffa and Ascalon and received a pension from that fief's income. Agnes soon thereafter married [[Hugh of Ibelin]], to whom she had been engaged before her marriage with Amalric. The church ruled that Amalric and Agnes' children were legitimate and preserved their place in the order of succession. Through her children Agnes would exert much influence in Jerusalem for almost 20 years.

== Conflicts with the Muslim states ==

As a [[Crusader state]] Jerusalem was constantly in a state of war. Since the failure to defeat the Zengids during the [[Second Crusade]] in 1147, the northern frontier was exposed to [[Nur ad-Din Zangi|Nur ad-Din]], whose own power continued to grow from his bases in [[Mosul]], [[Aleppo]], and later Damascus when that city fell under his control. Jerusalem lost influence to Byzantium in northern Syria when the Empire imposed its suzerainty over the [[Principality of Antioch]], although Byzantium was increasingly beset by its own conflicts, particularly with the [[Normans]] in [[Sicily]].

The main theatre of conflict of Amalric's reign was [[Fatimid]] [[Egypt]], which was suffering from a series of young [[caliph]]s and civil wars. The crusaders had wanted to conquer Egypt since the days of [[Baldwin I of Jerusalem|Baldwin I]], and even [[Godfrey of Bouillon]] had promised to cede Jerusalem to the [[Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem|Patriarch]] [[Dagobert of Pisa]] if he could capture [[Cairo]]. The capture of Ascalon by Baldwin III made the conquest of Egypt more feasible, and the [[Knights Hospitaller]] began preparing maps of the possible invasion routes.

===Invasions of Egypt===
{{main|Crusader invasion of Egypt}}
Amalric led his first expedition into Egypt in 1163, claiming that the Fatimids had not paid the yearly tribute that had begun during the reign of Baldwin III. The vizier, Dirgham, had recently overthrown the vizier [[Shawar]], and marched out to meet Amalric at [[Pelusium]], but was defeated and forced to retreat to [[Bilbeis]]. The Egyptians then opened up the [[Nile]] dams and let the river flood, hoping to prevent Amalric from invading any further. Amalric returned home but Shawar fled to the court of Nur ad-Din, who sent his general [[Shirkuh]] to settle the dispute in 1164. In response Dirgham sought help from Amalric, but Shirkuh and Shawar arrived before Amalric could intervene and Dirgham was killed. Shawar, however, feared that Shirkuh would seize power for himself, and he too looked to Amalric for assistance. Amalric returned to Egypt in 1164 and besieged Shirkuh in Bilbeis until Shirkuh retreated to Damascus.

Amalric could not follow up on his success in Egypt because Nur ad-Din was active in Syria, having taken [[Bohemund III of Antioch]] and [[Raymond III of Tripoli]] prisoner at the [[Battle of Harim]] during Amalric's absence. Amalric rushed to take up the regency of Antioch and Tripoli and secured Bohemund's ransom in 1165 (Raymond remained in prison until 1173). The year 1166 was relatively quiet, but Amalric sent envoys to the [[Byzantine Empire]] seeking an alliance and a Byzantine wife, and throughout the year had to deal with raids by Nur ad-Din, who captured [[Banias]].

In 1167, Nur ad-Din sent Shirkuh back to Egypt and Amalric once again followed him, establishing a camp near [[Cairo]]; Shawar again allied with Amalric as well and a treaty was signed with the caliph [[al-Adid]] himself. Shirkuh encamped on the opposite side of the [[Nile]]. After an indecisive battle, Amalric retreated to Cairo and Shirkuh took his troops to capture [[Alexandria]]; Amalric followed and besieged Shirkuh there, aided by a fleet from Jerusalem. Shirkuh negotiated for peace and Alexandria was handed over to Amalric. However Amalric could not remain there forever, and after exacting an enormous tribute, returned to Jerusalem.

===Byzantine alliance===

After his return in 1167 he married [[Maria Comnena, Queen consort of Jerusalem|Maria Comnena]], a great-grandniece of [[Byzantine emperor]] [[Manuel I Comnenus]]. The negotiations had taken two years, mostly because Amalric insisted that Manuel return [[Antioch]] to Jerusalem. Once Amalric gave up on this point he was able to marry Maria in [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]] on August 29, 1167. During this time the queen dowager, Baldwin III's widow [[Theodora Comnena|Theodora]], eloped with her cousin [[Andronicus I Comnenus|Andronicus]] to [[Damascus]], and [[Akko|Acre]] reverted back into the royal domain of Jerusalem. It was also around this time that [[William of Tyre]] was promoted to [[archdeacon]] of Tyre, and was recruited by Amalric to write a history of the kingdom.

In 1168 Amalric and Manuel negotiated an alliance against Egypt, and William of Tyre was among the ambassadors sent to [[Constantinople]] to finalize the treaty. Although Amalric still had a peace treaty with Shawar, Shawar was accused of attempting to ally with Nur ad-Din, and Amalric invaded. The [[Knights Hospitaller]] eagerly supported this invasion and may have even been responsible for convincing the king to do it, while the [[Knights Templar]] refused to have any part in it. In October, without waiting for any Byzantine assistance (and in fact without even waiting for the ambassadors to return), Amalric invaded and seized Bilbeis. The inhabitants were either massacred or enslaved. Amalric then marched to Cairo, where Shawar offered Amalric two million pieces of gold. Meanwhile Nur ad-Din sent Shirkuh back to Egypt as well, and upon his arrival Amalric retreated.

===Rise of Saladin===

In January of 1169 Shirkuh had Shawar assassinated. Shirkuh became vizier, although he himself died in March, and was succeeded by his nephew [[Saladin]]. Amalric became alarmed and sent [[Frederick de la Roche]], [[Archbishop of Tyre]], to seek help from the kings and nobles of Europe, but no assistance was forthcoming. Later that year however a Byzantine fleet arrived, and in October Amalric launched yet another invasion and besieged [[Damietta]] by sea and by land. The siege was long and famine broke out in the Christian camp; the Byzantines blamed the crusaders for the failure and vice versa, and a truce was signed with Saladin. Amalric returned home.

Now Jerusalem was surrounded by hostile enemies. In 1170 Saladin invaded Jerusalem and took the city of [[Eilat]], severing Jerusalem's connection with the Red Sea. Saladin, who was set up as Vizier of Egypt, was declared Sultan in 1171 with the death of the last of the Fatimid dynasty. Saladin's rise to Sultan was an unexpected reprieve for Jerusalem, as Nur ad-Din was now preoccupied with reining in his powerful vassal. Nevertheless, in 1171 Amalric visited Constantinople himself and envoys were sent to the kings of Europe for a second time, but again they were uninterested. Over the next few years the kingdom was threatened by not only Saladin and Nur ad-Din, but also the [[Hashshashin]]; in one episode, the Knights Templar murdered some Hashshashin envoys, leading to further disputes between Amalric and the Templars.

==Death==

Nur ad-Din died in 1174, upon which Amalric immediately besieged Banias. On the way back after giving up the siege he fell ill from [[dysentery]], which was ameliorated by doctors but turned into a fever in Jerusalem. William of Tyre explains that &quot;after suffering intolerably from the fever for several days, he ordered physicians of the Greek, Syrian, and other nations noted for skill in diseases to be called and insisted that they give him some purgative remedy.&quot; Neither they nor Latin doctors could help, and he died on July 11, 1174.

Maria Comnena had borne Amalric two daughters: [[Isabella of Jerusalem|Isabella]], who would eventually marry four husbands in turn and succeed as queen, was born in 1172; and a stillborn child some time later. On his deathbed Amalric bequeathed [[Nablus]] to Maria and Isabella, both of whom would retire there. The [[leprosy|leprous]] child [[Baldwin IV]] succeeded his father and brought his mother Agnes of Courtenay (now married to her fourth husband) back to court.

==Physical characteristics==

William was a good friend of Amalric and described him in great detail. &quot;He had a slight impediment in his speech, not serious enough to be considered as a defect but sufficient to render him incapable of ready eloquence. He was far better in counsel than in fluent or ornate speech.&quot; Like his brother Baldwin III, he was more of an academic than a warrior, who studied law and languages in his leisure time: &quot;He was well skilled in the customary law by which the kingdom was governed – in fact, he was second to no one in this respect.&quot; He was probably responsible for [[assise sur la ligece|an assize]] making all rear-vassals directly subject to the king and eligible to appear at the Haute Cour. Amalric had an enormous curiosity, and William was reportedly astonished to find Amalric questioning, during an illness, the [[Resurrection of the dead|resurrection]] of the body. He especially enjoyed reading and being read to, spending long hours listening to William read early drafts of his history. He did not enjoy games or spectacles, although he liked to hunt. He was trusting of his officials, perhaps too trusting, and it seems that there were many among the population who despised him, although he refused to take any action against those who insulted him publicly.

He was tall and fairly handsome; &quot;he had sparkling eyes of medium size; his nose, like that of his brother, was becomingly aquiline; his hair was blond and grew back somewhat from his forehead. A comely and very full beard covered his cheeks and chin. He had a way of laughing immoderately so that his entire body shook.&quot; He did not overeat or drink to excess, but his corpulence grew in his later years, decreasing his interest in military operations; according to William, he &quot;was excessively fat, with breasts like those of a woman hanging down to his waist.&quot;
Amalric was pious and attended mass every day, although he also &quot;is said to have absconded himself without restraint to the sins of the flesh and to have seduced married women…&quot; Despite his piety he taxed the clergy, which they naturally opposed.

As William says, &quot;he was a man of wisdom and discretion, fully competent to hold the reins of government in the kingdom.&quot; He is considered the last of the &quot;early&quot; [[kings of Jerusalem]], after whom there was no king able to save Jerusalem from its eventual collapse. Within a few years, Emperor Manuel died as well, and Saladin remained the only strong leader in the east.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Amalric II of Jerusalem''' or '''Amalric I of Cyprus''', born '''Amalric of Lusignan''' (1145 &amp;ndash;  1 April 1205), [[Kingdom of Jerusalem|King of Jerusalem]] 1197&amp;ndash;1205, was an older brother of [[Guy of Lusignan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;crusades-en&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last = Gerish | first = Deborah | title = Aimery of Lusignan | editor = Alan V. Murray | encyclopedia = The Crusades: An Encyclopedia | volume = 1 | pages = 24 | publisher = [[ABC-CLIO]] | location = [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]] | year = 2006 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=6cSXSgAACAAJ | oclc = 70122512}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Lusignan]] family was noted for its many Crusaders. Amalric and Guy were sons of [[Hugh VIII of Lusignan]], who had himself campaigned in the Holy Land in the 1160s. After being expelled from [[Poitou]] by their overlord, [[Richard I of England|Richard the Lion-hearted]], for the murder of [[Patrick of Salisbury, 1st Earl of Salisbury]], Amalric arrived in Palestine c. 1174, Guy possibly later. Amalric married Eschiva, daughter of [[Baldwin of Ibelin]]. He then took service with [[Agnes of Courtenay]], wife of [[Reginald of Sidon]] and mother of [[Baldwin IV of Jerusalem]]. The pro-Ibelin ''Chronicle of [[Ernoul]]'' later claimed that he was her lover, but it is likely that she and Baldwin IV were attempting to separate him from the political influence of his wife's family. He was appointed [[Officers of the Kingdom of Jerusalem|Constable of Jerusalem]] soon after April 22, 1179. Guy married the king's widowed older sister, [[Sibylla of Jerusalem]] in 1180, and so gained a claim to the kingdom of Jerusalem.

Amalric was among those captured with his brother after the disastrous [[Battle of Hattin]] in 1187. In 1194, on the death of Guy, he became [[Kingdom of Cyprus|King of Cyprus]] as Amalric I. By his first wife, Eschiva of Ibelin, he was the father of [[Hugh I of Cyprus]] and was crowned in [[Nicosia]] on September 22, 1197. After Eschiva's death in October 1197 he married [[Isabella of Jerusalem|Isabella]], the daughter of [[Amalric I of Jerusalem]] by his second marriage, and became [[Kings of Jerusalem|King of Jerusalem]] in right of his wife and crowned at [[Acre, Israel|Acre]] in January 1198.

In 1198 he was able to procure a five years' truce with the [[Muslim]]s, owing to the struggle between [[Saladin]]'s brothers and his sons for the inheritance of his territories. The truce was disturbed by raids on both sides, but in 1204 it was renewed for six years.

Amalric died of dysentery (allegedly brought on by &quot;a surfeit of white mullet&quot;) or even poisoned at [[Saint Jean d'Acre]] on 1 April 1205, just after his son Amalric and four days before his wife, and was buried at [[Selimiye Mosque (Nicosia)|Saint Sophia]], Nicosia.  The kingdom of Cyprus passed to [[Hugh I of Cyprus|Hugh]], his son by Eschiva, while the [[kingdom of Jerusalem]] passed to [[Maria of Montferrat|Maria]], the daughter of Isabella by her previous marriage with [[Conrad of Montferrat]].

==Wives and children==
His first wife, married before October 29, 1174, was [[Eschive d'Ibelin (1160-1196)|Eschiva of Ibelin]] (c. 1160 &amp;ndash; [[Cyprus]] in Winter 1196–1197), daughter of [[Baldwin of Ibelin]] and first wife Richilde de Bethsan or Bessan. They had six children:
# Bourgogne of Lusignan (1176–1180 or c. 1178 &amp;ndash; c. 1210), married as his third wife [[Raymond VI of Toulouse]] 1193, repudiated and divorced 1194 or 1196 without issue, married Gauthier I de Montfaucon aka Walter of Montbéliard (killed in action at the [[Battle of Satalia]], June 20, 1212) 1197 or bef. 1205, by whom she had issue.
# Guy of Lusignan, died young 1197-1205
# John of Lusignan, died young 1197-1205
# [[Hugh I of Cyprus|Hugh I of Lusignan]] (c. 1194–1218)
# Héloise/[[Helvis of Lusignan (1190-1218)|Helvis of Lusignan]] (c. 1190 &amp;ndash; 1216–1219, 1216/1219 or c. 1217), married firstly c. 1205 Eudes de Dampierre sur Salon, Lord of Chargey-le-Grey, div. 1210, married secondly before 1210 or in September 1210 [[Raymond-Roupen of Antioch]]
# Alix de Lusignan, died young 1197–1205

His second wife was Queen [[Isabella of Jerusalem]], married January 1198 in Acre. They had three children:
# [[Sybilla of Lusignan]] (October–November 1198 – c. 1230 or 1252), married King [[Leo II of Armenia]]
# [[Melisende of Lusignan]] (c. 1200 &amp;ndash; aft. 1249), married January 1, 1218 [[Bohemund IV of Antioch]]
# Amalric or Amaury of Lusignan (1201 &amp;ndash; February 2, 1205, Acre])

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{About||other people called &quot;Anthemius&quot;|Anthemius (disambiguation)}}
'''Anthemius of Tralles''' (c. 474 &amp;ndash; before 558; [[Greek language|Greek]]: {{Polytonic|Ἀνθέμιος ὁ Τραλλιανός}}) was a [[Greeks|Greek]] professor of [[Geometry]] in [[Constantinople]] (present-day [[Istanbul]] in Turkey) and [[architect]], who collaborated with [[Isidore of Miletus]] to build the church of [[Hagia Sophia]] by the order of [[Justinian I]]. Anthemius came from an educated family, one of five sons of Stephanus of [[Aydın|Tralles]], a physician. Of his brothers, Dioscorus followed his father's profession in Tralles; Alexander became at [[Rome]] one of the most celebrated medical men of his time; Olympius was deeply versed in [[Roman Law|Roman jurisprudence]]; and Metrodorus was a distinguished [[Philologist|grammarian]] in Constantinople.

As an architect he is best known for replacing the old church of [[Hagia Sophia]] at [[Constantinople]] in 532; his daring plans for the church strikingly displayed at once his knowledge and his ignorance. His skills seem also to have extended to engineering for he repaired the flood defences at [[Daras]].

Anthemius was also a capable mathematician. He described the string construction of the [[ellipse]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Boyer|authorlink=Carl Benjamin Boyer|title=|year=1991|chapter=Revival and Decline of Greek Mathematics|pages=193|quote=The commentary by Eutocius on the ''Conics'' of [[Apollonius]] was dedicated to Anthemius of Tralles (t534), an able mathematician and architect of St. Sophia of Constantinople, who described the string construction of the ellipse and wrote a work ''On Burning-mirrors'' in which the focal properties of the parabola are described.}} &lt;br /&gt;Although Anthemius died not 534 but before 558, cf. [[Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium]], p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; and he wrote a book on [[conic section]]s, which was excellent preparation for designing the elaborate vaulting of Hagia Sophia. He compiled a survey of mirror configurations in his work on remarkable mechanical devices which was known to [[Islamic mathematics|Arab mathematicians]] such as [[Ibn al-Haytham]].

A fragment of his treatise ''On burning-glasses'' was published as ''{{polytonic|Περί παραδόξων μηχανημάτων}}'' (&quot;Concerning wondrous machines&quot;) by L. Dupuy in 1777, and also appeared in 1786 in the forty-second volume of the ''Histoire de l'Academie des Instrumentistes''. A. Westermann gave a revised edition of it in his ''{{polytonic|Παραδοξογράφοι}}'' (''Scriptores rerum mirabilium Graeci'', &quot;Greek marvel-writers&quot;) in 1839. In the course of the constructions for surfaces to reflect to one and the same point
# all rays in whatever direction passing through another point,
# a set of parallel rays,
Anthemius assumes a property of an ellipse not found in Apollonius work, that the equality of the angles subtended at a focus by two [[tangents]] drawn from a point, and having given the focus and a double ordinate he goes on to use the focus and [[directrix]] to obtain any number of points on a [[parabola]]&amp;mdash;the first instance on record of the practical use of the directrix.

'''Absalon''' ({{circa|1128}} – 21 March 1201) was a [[Denmark|Danish]] [[archbishop]] and statesman, who was the [[Bishop of Roskilde]] from 1158 to 1192 and [[Archbishop of Lund]] from 1178 until his death. He was the foremost politician and churchfather of Denmark in the second half of the 12th century, and was the closest advisor of King [[Valdemar I of Denmark]]. He was a key figure in the Danish policies of territorial expansion in the [[Baltic Sea]], [[Europeanization]] in close relationship with the [[Holy See]], and reform in the relation between the Church and the public. He combined the ideals of [[Gregorian Reform]] ideals with loyal support of a strong [[Monarch]]ical power.

Absalon was born into the powerful ''[[Hvide]]'' clan, and owned great land possessions. He endowed several church institutions, most prominently his family's [[Sorø Abbey]]. He was granted lands by the crown, and built the first fortification of the city that evolved into modern-day [[Copenhagen]]. His titles were passed on to his nephews [[Anders Sunesen]] and [[Peder Sunesen]]. He died in 1201, and was interred at Sorø Abbey.

==Early life==
Absalon was born around 1128. Due to a name which is unusual in Denmark, it is speculated that he was christened on the Danish &quot;Absalon&quot; [[name day]], October 30.&lt;ref name=&quot;bricka&quot;/&gt; He was the son of [[Asser Rig]], a [[magnate]] of the ''[[Hvide]]'' clan from Fjenneslev on [[Zealand (Denmark)|Zealand]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot;&gt;[[Encyclopædia Britannica, Eleventh Edition]], 1911, [http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/200/pg200.html &quot;Absalon&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; He was also a kinsman of [[Eskil of Lund|Archbishop Eskil of Lund]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bricka&quot;&gt;[[Carl Frederik Bricka]] (ed.), ''Dansk Biografisk Lexikon'', vol. I [Aaberg - Beaumelle], 1887. A.D. Jørgensen, &quot;Absalon&quot; [http://runeberg.org/dbl/1/0088.html pp.70-81]&lt;/ref&gt; He grew up at the castle of his father, and was brought up alongside his older brother [[Esbern Snare]] and the young prince Valdemar, who later became King [[Valdemar I of Denmark]].&lt;ref name=&quot;gyldendal&quot;/&gt; During the civil war following the death of [[Eric III of Denmark]] in 1146, Absalon travelled abroad to study [[theology]] in [[Paris]], while Esbern fought for Valdemar's ascension to the throne. At Paris, he was influenced by the [[Gregorian Reform]] ideals of churchly independence from Monarchical rule.&lt;ref name=&quot;gad&quot;&gt;&quot;Gads Historieleksikon&quot;, 3rd edition, 2006. Paul Ulff-Møller, &quot;''Absalon''&quot;, p.10. ISBN 87-12-04259-5&lt;/ref&gt; He also befriended the canon [[William of Æbelholt]] at the [[Abbey of St Genevieve]], whom he later made abbott of [[Eskilsø Abbey]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bricka&quot;/&gt;

Absalon first appears in [[Saxo Grammaticus]]'s contemporary chronicle ''[[Gesta Danorum]]'' at the end of the civil war, at the brokering of the peace agreement between [[Sweyn III of Denmark|Sweyn III]] and Valdemar at [[St. Alban's Priory, Odense]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bricka&quot;/&gt; He was a guest at following [[Roskilde]] banquet given in 1157 by Sweyn to his rivals [[Canute V of Denmark|Canute V]] and Valdemar.  Both Absalon and Valdemar narrowly escaped assassination at the hands of Sweyn on this occasion, and escaped to [[Jutland]], whither Sweyn followed them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot;/&gt; Absalon probably did not take part in the following [[battle of Grathe Heath]] in 1157, in which Sweyn was defeated and slain and led to Valdemar ascending the Danish throne. On [[Good Friday]] 1158, bishop [[Asser of Roskilde]] died, and Absalon was eventually elected [[Roskilde (titular see)|bishop of Roskilde]] on Zealand with the help of Valdemar,&lt;ref name=&quot;bricka&quot;/&gt; as the king's reward for the ''Hvide'' family support.&lt;ref name=&quot;pajung&quot;&gt;Stefan Pajung, [http://www.danmarkshistorien.dk/leksikon-og-kilder/vis/materiale/absalon-ca-1128-1201/ Artikel: Absalon ca. 1128-1201], [[Aarhus University]], June 20, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bishop and advisor==
Absalon was a close counsellor of Valdemar, and chief promotor of the Danish [[crusade]]s against the [[Wends]].&lt;ref name=&quot;gyldendal&quot;/&gt; During the Danish civil war, Denmark had been open to coastal raids by the Wends.&lt;ref name=&quot;pajung&quot;/&gt; It was Absalon's intention to clear the [[Baltic Sea]] of the Wendish pirates who inhabited its southern [[littoral zone]] which was later called [[Pomerania]]. The pirates had raided the Danish coasts during the civil war of Sweyn III, Canute V, and Valdemar, to the point where at the accession of Valdemar one-third of Denmark lay wasted and depopulated.&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot;/&gt; Absalon formed a guardian fleet, built coastal defenses, and led several campaigns against the Wends.&lt;ref name=&quot;pajung&quot;/&gt; He even advocated forgiving the earlier enemies of Valdemar, which helped stabilize Denmark internally.&lt;ref name=&quot;bricka&quot;/&gt;

===Wendish campaigns===
[[Image:Bishop Absalon topples the god Svantevit at Arkona.PNG|266px|thumb|right|[[Laurits Tuxen]]: Bishop Absalon topples the god Svantevit at Arkona in 1169.]]
The first expedition against the [[Wends]] that was conducted by Absalon in person, set out in 1160.&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot;/&gt; These expeditions were successful, but brought no lasting victories.&lt;ref name=&quot;bricka&quot;/&gt; What started out as mere retribution, eventually evolved into full-fledged campaigns of expansion with religious crusader motives.&lt;ref name=&quot;pajung&quot;/&gt; In 1164 began twenty years of crusades against the Wends, sometimes with the help of German duke [[Henry the Lion]], sometimes in opposition to him.&lt;ref name=&quot;bricka&quot;/&gt;

In 1168 the chief Wendish fortress at [[Cape Arkona|Arkona]] in [[Rügen]], containing the sanctuary of their god [[Svetovid|Svantevit]], was conquered. The Wends agreed to accept Danish suzerainty and the [[Christian religion]] at the same time. From Arkona, Absalon proceeded by sea to [[Charenza]], in the midst of Rügen, the political capital of the Wends and an all but impregnable stronghold.  But the unexpected fall of Arkona had terrified the garrison, which surrendered unconditionally at the first appearance of the Danish ships.  Absalon, with only [[Sweyn of Aarhus|Bishop Sweyn of Aarhus]], and twelve &quot;[[housecarl]]s&quot; thereupon disembarked, passed between a double row of Wendish warriors, 6000 strong, along the narrow path winding among the morasses, to the gates of the fortress, and, proceeding to the temple of the seven-headed god [[Rugiewit|Rugievit]], caused the idol to be hewn down, dragged forth and burnt. The whole population of [[Garz/Rügen|Garz]] was then baptized, and Absalon laid the foundations of twelve churches in the isle of Rügen.&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot;/&gt; Rügen was then subjected to Absalon's Bishopric of Roskilde.&lt;ref name=&quot;pajung&quot;/&gt;

The destruction of this chief sally-port of the Wendish pirates enabled Absalon considerably to reduce the Danish fleet.  But he continued to keep a watchful eye over the Baltic, and in 1170 destroyed another pirate stronghold, farther eastward, at [[Dziwnów]] on the isle of [[Wolin]]. Absalon's last military exploit came in 1184, off [[Stralsund]] at [[Whitsun]], when he soundly defeated a Pomeranian fleet that had attacked Denmark's vassal, [[Jaromir of Rügen]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot;/&gt;

===Policies===
Absalon's main political goal was to free Denmark from entanglements with the [[Holy Roman Empire]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot;/&gt;  Absalon reformed the Danish church organisation to closer match [[Holy See]] praxis, and worked to keep Denmark a close ally of the Holy See.&lt;ref name=&quot;gyldendal&quot;/&gt; However, during the [[Schism (religion)|schism]] between [[Pope Alexander III]] and [[Antipope Victor IV (1159–1164)|Antipope Victor IV]], Absalon stayed loyal to Valdemar even as he joined the Holy Roman Emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barberossa]] in supporting Victor IV.&lt;ref name=&quot;pajung&quot;/&gt; This caused a split within the Danish church, as it possibly forced Eskil into exile around 1161,&lt;ref name=&quot;gyldendal&quot;/&gt; despite Abaslon's attempts to keep the Danish church united.&lt;ref name=&quot;bricka&quot;/&gt; It was contrary to Absalon's advice and warnings that Valdemar I rendered [[fealty]] to the emperor Frederick Barbarossa at [[Dole, Jura|Dole]] in 1162.&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot;/&gt; When Valdemar returned to Denmark, he was convinced into strengthening the [[Danevirke]] fortifications at the German border, with the support of Absalon.&lt;ref name=&quot;bricka&quot;/&gt;

Absalon built churches and monasteries, supporting international religious orders like the [[Cistercians]] and [[Augustinians]], founding schools and doing his utmost to promote civilization and enlightenment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot;/&gt; In 1162, Absalon transformed the [[Sorø Abbey]] of his family from [[Benedictine]] to Cistercian, granting it lands from his personal holdings. In 1167, Absalon was granted the land around the city of &quot;Havn&quot; ({{lang-en|Harbour}}), and built there a castle in the coastal defense against the Wends.&lt;ref name=&quot;gyldendal&quot;/&gt; Havn quickly expanded as one of [[Scandinavia]]'s most important centers of trade, and eventually evolved into modern-day [[Copenhagen]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bricka&quot;/&gt; It was also Absalon who held the first Danish [[Synod]] at [[Lund]] in 1167.&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot;/&gt; He was also interested in history and culture, and commissioned [[Saxo Grammaticus]] to write ''[[Gesta Danorum]]'', a comprehensive chronicle of the history of the Danes.&lt;ref name=&quot;pajung&quot;/&gt; In 1171, Absalon issued the &quot;Zealand church law&quot; ({{lang-da|Sjællandske Kirkelov}}), which reduced the number of [[Canonical Law]] offenses for which the church could fine the public, while instituting the [[tithe]] payment system. Eventual violation of the law was specified as subject to a secular legal process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Samfund%2c_jura_og_politik/Jura/Retshistorie/kirkelove Kirkelove] at Gyldendals Åbne Encyklopædi&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archbishop of Lund==
Archbishop Eskil returned from exile in 1167. Eskil agreed on [[canonization|canonizing]] Valdemar's father [[Knud Lavard]] in 1170, with Absalon assisting him at the feast. When Eskil stepped down as Archbishop of Lund in 1177, he chose Absalon as his successor.&lt;ref name=&quot;pajung&quot;/&gt; Absalon initially resisted the new position, as he did not want to loose his power position on Zealand, but complied with Papal orders to do so in 1178.&lt;ref name=&quot;bricka&quot;/&gt; By a unique Papal dispensation, Absalon was allowed to simultaneously maintain his post as Bishop of Roskilde.&lt;ref name=&quot;gyldendal&quot;/&gt; As the Archbishop of Lund, Absalon utilized [[ombudsman|ombudsmen]] from Zealand, demanded [[unfree labour]] from the [[peasantry]], and instituted tithes.&lt;ref name=&quot;pajung&quot;/&gt; He was a harsh and effective ruler, who cleared all [[Orthodox Christian]] [[Liturgy|liturgic]] remnants in favour of Papal standards.&lt;ref name=&quot;gyldendal&quot;/&gt; A rebellion in the [[Scania]]n peasantry forced him to flee to Zealand in 1180, from where he returned and subdued the Scanians with the help of Valdemar.&lt;ref name=&quot;pajung&quot;/&gt; 

When Valdemar died in 1182, his son succeeded him as [[Canute VI of Denmark|Canute VI]], and Absalon served as Canute VI's counsellor.&lt;ref name=&quot;pajung&quot;/&gt; Under Canute VI, Absalon was the chief policymaker in Danish politics.&lt;ref name=&quot;gad&quot;/&gt; Absalon kept his hostile attitude to the Holy Roman Empire. On the accession of Canute VI in 1182, an imperial ambassador arrived at Roskilde to the new king swear fealty to Frederick Barberossa, but Absalon resolutely withstood him.&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot;/&gt; This represented the final Danish rejection of German supremacy.&lt;ref name=&quot;bricka&quot;/&gt;

===Death===
[[Image:Absalons ligsten.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Absalon's gravestone in Sorø Abbey.]]
When Absalon retired from military service in 1184 at the age of fifty-seven, he resigned the command of fleets and armies to younger men, like Duke Valdemar, the later king [[Valdemar II of Denmark|Valdemar II]]. He instead confined himself to the administration of the Danish empire.&lt;ref name=&quot;bricka&quot;/&gt; In 1192, Absalon made his nephew [[Peder Sunesen]] his successor as Bishop of Roskilde, while his other nephew [[Anders Sunesen]] was named the [[chancellor]] of Canute VI.&lt;ref name=&quot;pajung&quot;/&gt; Absalon died at Sorø Abbey on March 21, 1201, 73 years old, with his last will granting his personal holdings to the Abbey, apart from Fjenneslev which went to Esbern Snarre. He had already given Copenhagen to the Bishopric of Roskilde.&lt;ref name=&quot;bricka&quot;/&gt; Absalon was interred at Sorø Abbey,&lt;ref name=&quot;pajung&quot;/&gt; and was succeeded as Archbishop of Lund by Anders Sunesen.&lt;ref name=&quot;gyldendal&quot;/&gt;

==Legacy==
Saxo Grammaticus' ''Gesta Danorum'' was not finished until after the death of Absalon,&lt;ref name=&quot;gyldendal&quot;/&gt; but Absalon was one of the chief heroic figures of the chronicle, which was to be the main source of knowledge about early Danish history.&lt;ref name=&quot;pajung&quot;/&gt; Absalon left a legacy as the foremost politician and churchfather of Denmark in the 12th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;gyldendal&quot;&gt;[http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Danmarks_geografi_og_historie/Danmarks_historie/Danmark_f%C3%B8r_Reformationen/Absalon Absalon] at Gyldendals Åbne Encyklopædi&lt;/ref&gt; Absalon was equally great as churchman, statesman and warrior. His policy of expansion was to give Denmark the dominion of the Baltic for three generations. That he enjoyed warfare there can be no doubt; yet he was not like the ordinary fighting bishops of the [[Middle Ages]], whose sole indication of their religious role was to avoid the ''shedding of blood'' by using a mace in battle instead of a sword.  Absalon never neglected his ecclesiastical duties, and even his wars were of the nature of crusades.&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot;/&gt;

In the 2000s, &quot;Absalon&quot; was adopted as the name for a class of [[Royal Danish Navy]] vessels, and the lead vessel of the class. [[HDMS Absalon (L16)]] and ''Esbern Snare'' (L17) were launched and commissioned by [[Denmark]] in 2004 and 2005.&lt;ref&gt;http://forsvaret.dk/2ESK/ENHEDER/FS/ABSL/Pages/default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naval-technology.com/projects/absalon/absalon2.html Absalon Class Combat / Flexible Support Ship, Denmark] naval-technology.com&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2008, ''HDMS Absalon'' was involved in the rescue of putative [[Somali pirates]] 90 miles off [[Yemen]] in the [[Gulf of Aden]]. The craft from [[Somalia]] was reported to hold rocket-propelled grenades and AK-47 assault rifles, and to have been adrift for several days. Also per the report, the ''Absalon'' took the sailors and weapons aboard, sunk the craft, and turned the sailors over to the Yemen coast guard. The ''Absalon'', according to ''The New York Times'' report, &quot;was deployed in the Gulf of Aden [in] September ['08] as part of an international effort to curb piracy,&quot; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/06/world/europe/06pirate.html?hp Danish Navy Rescues Suspected Pirates] by Alan Cowell, ''The New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt; part of [[Combined Task Force 150]].

[[Image:Adhemar of Le Puy.gif|thumb|right|200px|19th century painting on display at [[Versailles]] depicting Adhemar of Le Puy (in red to left of [[Raymond IV, Count of Toulouse]]).]] 
'''Adhemar''' (also known as '''Adémar''', '''Aimar''', or '''Aelarz''') '''de Monteil''' (died 1 August 1098), one of the principal figures of the [[First Crusade]], was [[bishop of Puy-en-Velay]] from before 1087. At the [[Council of Clermont]] in 1095, Adhemar showed great zeal for the crusade (there is evidence Urban II had conferred with Adhemar before the council) and having been named [[apostolic legate]] and appointed to lead the crusade by [[Pope Urban II]], he accompanied [[Raymond IV of Toulouse|Raymond IV]], [[Count of Toulouse]], to the east. Whilst Raymond and the other leaders often quarrelled with each other over the leadership of the crusade, Adhemar was always recognized as the spiritual leader of the crusade.

Adhemar negotiated with [[Alexius I Comnenus]] at [[Constantinople]], reestablished at [[İznik|Nicaea]] some discipline among the crusaders, fought a crucial role at the [[Battle of Dorylaeum (1097)|Battle of Dorylaeum]] and was largely responsible for sustaining morale during the [[siege of Antioch]] through various religious rites including fasting and special observances of holy days. After the capture of [[Antioch|the city]] in June, 1098, and the subsequent siege led by [[Kerbogha]], Adhemar organized a procession through the streets, and had the gates locked so that the Crusaders, many of whom had begun to panic, would be unable to desert the city. He was extremely skeptical of [[Peter Bartholomew]]'s discovery in Antioch of the [[Holy Lance]], especially because he knew such a relic already existed in Constantinople; however, he was willing to let the Crusader army believe it was real if it raised their morale. 

When Kerbogha was defeated, Adhemar organized a council in an attempt to settle the leadership disputes, but he died on 1 August 1098, probably of [[typhus]]. The disputes among the higher nobles went unsolved, and the march to [[Jerusalem]] was delayed for months. However, the lower-class foot soldiers continued to think of Adhemar as a leader; some of them claimed to have been visited by his ghost during the [[siege of Jerusalem (1099)|siege of Jerusalem]], and reported that Adhemar instructed them to hold another procession around the walls. This was done, and Jerusalem was taken by the Crusaders in 1099.

In this illustration he takes an oath before the consuls with his right hand on the town ordinances, while sitting on a pedestal. The consul administerin the oath is forced to go on his knees, symbolising Alphonse's lordship and the town's loyalty.]]

'''Alfonso''' or '''Alphonse''' (11 November 1220 – 21 August 1271) was the [[Count of Poitou]] from 1225 and [[Count of Toulouse]] (as '''Alfonso II''') from 1247. 

Born at [[Poissy]], Alphonse was a son of [[Louis VIII of France|Louis VIII]], [[King of France]] and [[Blanche of Castile]]. He was a younger brother of [[Louis IX of France]] and an older brother of [[Charles I of Sicily]]. The [[Treaty of Paris (1229)|Treaty of Paris]] stipulated that a brother of King Louis was to marry [[Joan of Toulouse]], daughter of [[Raymond VII of Toulouse]], and so in 1237 Alphonse married her.&lt;ref&gt;Fawtier 123&lt;/ref&gt; By the terms of his father's will he received an ''[[appanage]]'' of [[Poitou]] and [[Rulers of Auvergne|Auvergne]]. He won the [[battle of Taillebourg]] in the [[Saintonge War]] with his brother Louis IX, against a revolt allied with king Henry III of England.

Alphonse took part in two crusades with his brother, St Louis, in 1248 (the [[Seventh Crusade]]) and in 1270 (the [[Eighth Crusade]]). For the first of these, he raised a large sum and a substantial force, arriving in [[Damietta]] on 24 October 1249, after the town had already been captured.&lt;ref&gt;Strayer, 496-7&lt;/ref&gt; He sailed for home on 10 August 1250.&lt;ref&gt;Strayer 505&lt;/ref&gt; His father-in-law had died while he was away, and he went directly to Toulouse to take possession.&lt;ref&gt;Hallam 218&lt;/ref&gt; There was some resistance to his accession as count, which was suppressed with the help of his mother Blanche of Castile who was acting as regent in the absence of Louis IX.&lt;ref name = &quot;wptmus&quot;&gt;Hallam 258&lt;/ref&gt; The county of Toulouse, since them, was joined to the Alphonse's ''appanage''.

In 1252, on the death of his mother, Blanche of Castile, Alphonse was joint regent with [[Charles of Anjou]] until the return of Louis IX.  During that time he took a great part in the campaigns and negotiations which led to the [[Treaty of Paris (1259)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1259, under which King [[Henry III of England]] recognized his loss of continental territory to [[France]] (including [[Normandy]], [[Maine (province of France)|Maine]], [[Anjou]], and [[Poitou]]) in exchange for France withdrawing support from English rebels.

[[File:Armoiries Alphonse Poitiers.svg|thumb|upright|Alphonse's [[coat of arms]] was formed of those of France (left) and Castile (right), representing his father and mother repsectively: ''Per pale azure semé-de-lis or dimidiating gules semé of castles or'']]

Aside from the crusades, Alphonse stayed primarily in Paris, governing his estates by officials, inspectors who reviewed the officials work, and a constant stream of messages.&lt;ref&gt;Petit-Dutaillis 299-300&lt;/ref&gt; His main work was on his own estates. There he repaired the evils of the [[Albigensian Crusade|Albigensian war]] and made a first attempt at administrative centralization, thus preparing the way for union with the crown. The charter known as &quot;Alphonsine,&quot; granted to the town of [[Riom]], became the code of public law for [[Auvergne (province)|Auvergne]]. Honest and moderate, protecting the middle classes against exactions of the nobles, he exercised a happy influence upon the south, in spite of his naturally despotic character and his continual and pressing need of money.  He is noted for ordering the first recorded local expulsion of [[Jew]]s, when he did so in Poitou in 1249.

When Louis IX again engaged in a crusade (the [[Eighth Crusade]]), Alphonse again raised a large sum of money and accompanied his brother.&lt;ref&gt;Strayer 511&lt;/ref&gt; This time, however, he did not return to France, dying while on his way back, probably at [[Savona]] in Italy, on 21 August 1271. 

Alphonse's death without heirs raised some questions as to the succession to his lands. One possibility was that they should revert to the crown, another that they should be redistributed to his family. The latter was claimed by Charles of Anjou, but in 1283 [[Parlement]] decided that the County of Toulouse should revert to the crown, if there were no male heirs.&lt;ref name = &quot;wptmus&quot;/&gt; Alphonse's wife Joan (who died five days after Alphonse) had attempted to dispose of some of her inherited lands in her will. Joan was the only surviving child and heiress of [[Raymond VII]], Count of Toulouse, Duke of Narbonne, and Marquis of Provence, so under Provençal and French law, the lands should have gone to her nearest male relative. But, her will was invalidated by Parlement in 1274&lt;ref name = &quot;wptmus&quot;/&gt; One specific bequest in Alphonse's will, giving his wife's lands in the [[Comtat Venaissin]] to the [[Holy See]], was allowed, and it became a [[Papal States|Papal territory]], a status that it retained until 1791.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Alfonso Jordan''' ({{lang-fr|Alphonse Jourdain}}) (1103–1148) was the [[Count of Tripoli]] from 1105 until 1109 and thereafter [[Counts of Toulouse|Count of Toulouse]] (as Alfonso I) until his death. He was the son of [[Raymond IV of Toulouse]] by his third wife, [[Elvira of Castile]], was born in the castle of [[Mont-Pelerin]], [[Tripoli, Lebanon|Tripoli]], in today's [[Lebanon]]. He was born while his father was on crusade, attempting to create the [[County of Tripoli]] on the Palestinian coast. He was surnamed ''Jordan'' after being [[baptised]] in the [[Jordan River]]. 

His father died when he was two years old and he remained under the guardianship of his cousin, [[Guillaume Jourdain]], count of [[Cerdanya|Cerdagne]] (d. 1109), until he was five. He was then taken to [[Europe]] and his brother [[Bertrand of Toulouse|Bertrand]] gave him the county of [[Rouergue]]. In his tenth year, upon Bertrand's death (1112), he succeeded to the county of Toulouse and marquisate of [[Provence]], but Toulouse was taken from him by [[William IX of Aquitaine|William IX]], [[count of Poitiers]], in 1114, who claimed it by right of his wife Philippa of Toulouse, daughter of [[William IV of Toulouse]]. He recovered a part in 1119, but continued to fight for his possessions until about 1123. When at last successful, he was [[excommunication|excommunicated]] by [[Pope Callixtus II]] for having expelled the monks of [[Saint-Gilles]], who had aided his enemies. 

He next fought for the sovereignty of Provence against [[Ramon Berenguer III, Count of Barcelona|Raymond Berenger III]], and not till September 1125 did the war end in an amicable agreement. Under it Jourdain became absolute master of the regions lying between the [[Pyrenees]] and the [[Alps]], [[Auvergne (province)|Auvergne]] and the sea. His ascendancy was an unmixed good to the country, for during a period of fourteen years art and industry flourished. About 1134 he seized the [[Viscount of Narbonne|viscounty of Narbonne]], only restoring it to the Viscountess [[Ermengarde of Narbonne|Ermengarde]] (d. 1197) in 1143. The claim of the now deceased Philippa of Toulouse was pressed again when [[Louis VII of France|Louis VII]] besieged Toulouse in 1141, in right of his wife [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]], the granddaughter of Philippa, but without result.

Next year Jourdain again incurred the displeasure of the church by siding with the rebels of [[Montpellier]] against their lord. A second time he was excommunicated; but in 1146 he took the cross at the meeting of [[Vezelay]] called by Louis VII, and in August, 1147 embarked for the East in the [[Second Crusade]]. He lingered on the way in [[Italy]] and probably in [[Constantinople]]. Alphonse might have met [[Eastern Roman Emperor]] [[Manuel I Comnenus]] during his visit there.

But in 1148 Alphonse had finally arrived at [[Acre, Palestine|Acre]]. Among his companions he had made enemies and he was destined to take no share in the crusade he had joined.  He was poisoned at [[Caesarea]], either by [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]], the wife of Louis, or [[Melisende of Jerusalem|Melisende]], the mother of [[Baldwin III of Jerusalem|Baldwin III]], [[Kingdom of Jerusalem|king of Jerusalem]] suggesting the draught. 

Alfonso married in 1125 Faydiva d'Uzes and had the following issue:

# [[Raymond V of Toulouse]]
# Faydiva (d.1154), wife of [[Humbert III of Savoy]]
# Agnes (d.1187)
# Alphonso

He also had illegitimate issue, including:
# Laurentia, wife of [[Bernard III of Comminges]])

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{other uses}}
'''Ambroise''' (flourished c. 1190) was a [[Normans|Norman]] poet and chronicler of the [[Third Crusade]], author of a work called ''L'Estoire de la guerre sainte'', which describes in rhyming [[Old French language|Old French]] verse the adventures of [[Richard I of England|Richard Coeur de Lion]] as a [[crusade]]r.  The poem is known to us only through one [[Vatican Library|Vatican]] [[manuscript]], and long escaped the notice of historians.  

The credit for detecting its value belongs to [[Gaston Paris]], although his edition (1897) was partially anticipated by the editors of the ''[[Monumenta Germaniae Historica]]'', who published some selections in the twenty-seventh volume of their Scriptores (1885). Ambroise followed Richard I as a [[noncombatant]], and not improbably as a court-[[minstrel]]. He speaks as an eye-witness of the king's doings at [[Messina, Italy|Messina]], in [[Cyprus]],  at the [[siege of Acre (1189–1191)|siege of Acre]], and in the abortive campaign which followed the capture of that city.  

Ambroise is surprisingly accurate in his [[chronology]]; though he did not complete his work before 1195, it is evidently founded upon notes which he had taken in the course of his [[pilgrimage]].  He shows no greater political insight than we should expect from his position; but relates what he had seen and heard with a naïve vivacity which compels attention. He is by no means an impartial source: he is prejudiced against the [[Saracens]], against the French, and against all the rivals or enemies of his master, including the ''Polein'' party which supported [[Conrad of Montferrat]] against [[Guy of Lusignan]]. He is rather to be treated as a [[biographer]] than as a historian of the Crusade in its broader aspects. Nonetheless he is an interesting primary source for the events of the years 1190–1192 in the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]].

The ''[[Itinerarium Regis Ricardi]]'', a Latin prose narrative of the same events apparently compiled by Richard, a canon of Holy Trinity, London, is closely related to Ambroise's poem. It was formerly sometimes regarded as the first-hand narrative on which Ambroise based his work, but that can no longer be maintained.

'''Art Deco''' ‎ ({{IPA-en|ˈɑːt ˈdɛkoʊ}}, also '''Deco''') is an [[Eclecticism in art|eclectic]] artistic and design style that began in Paris in the 1920s&lt;ref name=&quot;Hillier1&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last=Hillier | first= Bevis | title=Art Deco: of the 20s and 30s | publisher=Studio Vista | year=1968 | page=12 |isbn= 9780289277881 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kanne-kruike.nl/Merkeninfo/Merk12E.html|title=Art Deco|publisher=Kanne and Kruike|accessdate=7 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and flourished internationally throughout the 1930s, into the World War II era.&lt;ref name=&quot;University Times&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|date=9 October 2003|title=How Art Deco came to be|journal=University Times|publisher=University of Pittsburgh|volume=36|issue=4|url=http://mac10.umc.pitt.edu/u/FMPro?-db=ustory&amp;-lay=a&amp;-format=d.html&amp;storyid=1754&amp;-Find|accessdate=07/11/2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The style influenced all areas of design, including architecture and interior design, [[industrial design]], fashion and jewelry, as well as the [[visual arts]] such as painting, [[graphic arts]] and film. The term &quot;art deco&quot; was first used widely in 1966, after an exhibition in Paris, 'Les Années 25' sub-titled Art Deco,&lt;ref&gt;Bayer, Patricia, ‘’’Art Deco Architecture: design, decoration and detail from the twenties and thirties’’, Thames &amp; Hudson, London 1992 p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; celebrating the 1925 [[Exposition Internationale des Arts Décoratifs et Industriels Modernes]] that was the culmination of style moderne in Paris.  At its best, Art Deco represented elegance, [[glamour (presentation)|glamour]], functionality and modernity. 

Art Deco's linear symmetry was a distinct departure from the flowing asymmetrical organic curves of its predecessor style [[Art Nouveau]]; it embraced influences from many different styles of the early 20th century, including [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]], [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]], [[Cubism]], [[Modernism]] and [[Futurism (art)|Futurism]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Essential Art Deco&quot; /&gt; and drew inspiration from ancient Egyptian and Aztec forms. Although many design movements have political or philosophical beginnings or intentions, Art Deco was purely decorative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/nal/guides/art_deco/index.html|title=Art Deco Study Guide|publisher=Victoria and Albert Museum|accessdate=1 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Art Deco experienced a decline in popularity during the late 1930s and early 1940s, but had a resurgence during the 1960s with the first book on the subject by [[Bevis Hillier]] in 1968 and later an exhibition organised by him in Minneapolis in 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hillier1&quot;/&gt; It continued with the popularization of [[graphic design]] during the 1980s. Art Deco had a profound influence on many later artistic styles, such as [[Memphis Group|Memphis]] and [[Pop art]].

Architectural examples survive in many different locations worldwide, in countries as diverse as China (Shanghai), the UK, Latvia, Spain, Cuba, Mexico, Indonesia, the Philippines, Argentina, Poland, Austria, Germany, Russia, Romania, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, India, Brazil, Colombia and the United States. In New York, the [[Empire State Building]], the [[Chrysler Building]] and [[Rockefeller Center]] are among the largest and best-known examples of the style. Riga, Latvia, has the largest collection of Art Deco buildings in Europe.

==History==

After the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|Universal Exposition of 1900]], various [[French art of the 20th century|French artists]] formed an informal collective known as ''La Société des artistes décorateurs'' (the society of the decorator artists).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/soci-t-des-artistes-d-corateurs |title=Société des Artistes Décorateurs: Definition from |publisher=Answers.com |date= |accessdate=8 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Founders included [[Hector Guimard]], [[Eugène Grasset]], [[Raoul Lachenal]], [[Paul Bellot]], [[Maurice Dufrêne]], and [[Emile Decoeur]]. These artists greatly influenced the principles of Art Deco as a whole.&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyclopedia of Art Deco&quot; /&gt; 

This society's purpose was to demonstrate internationally the evolution of the French decorative arts. They organized the 1925&lt;ref&gt;Scarlett and Townley, ''Arts Décoratifs 1925: A Personal Recollection of the Paris Exhibition'', Academy Editions, London, St. Martin's Press, New York, 1975&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Exposition Internationale des Arts Décoratifs et Industriels Modernes]]'' (International Exposition of Modern Industrial and Decorative Art) in Paris,&lt;ref name=&quot;Design Handbook&quot; /&gt; which would feature French art and business interests.&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyclopedia of Art Deco&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Paris 1925 Exhibition&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/vastatic/microsites/1157_art_deco/virtual/gallery1/paris1925.htm|title=The Paris 1925 Exhibition|publisher=V&amp;A Publishers|accessdate=30 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The terms ''style moderne'' and ''art deco'' both derive from the exposition's title,&lt;ref name=&quot;University Times&quot; /&gt; though the term ''art deco'' was not used much until popularized by art historian [[Bevis Hillier]]'s 1968 book ''Art Deco of the 20s and 30s''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hillier1&quot;/&gt;

During the summer of 1969, Hillier conceived organizing an exhibition named ''Art Deco'' at the [[Minneapolis Institute of Arts]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pheebay.com/?so-what-is-art-deco-design-472.html|title=So What Is Art Deco Design?|publisher=pheebay.com|year=2008|accessdate=30 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; which occurred from July to September 1971. After this event, interest in Art Deco increased with the publication of his 1971 book ''The World of Art Deco'', a record of the exhibition.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hillier2&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first=Bevis|last=Hillier|title=The World of Art Deco: An Exhibition Organized by The Minneapolis Institute of Arts, June- September 1971 |publisher=E.P. Dutton &amp; Company|year=1971 |isbn=9780525476801}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sources and influences==
The structure of Art Deco is based on mathematical [[Geometry|geometric]] shapes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Design: A Concise History&quot; /&gt; It was widely considered to be an eclectic form of elegant and stylish [[modernism]], being influenced by a variety of sources. The ability to travel and archaeological excavations during this time influenced artists and designers, integrating several elements from countries not their own. Among them were historical styles such as Greco-Roman [[Classicism]], as well as the art of [[Babylon]], [[Assyria]], [[Art of ancient Egypt|Ancient Egypt]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Design: A Concise History&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Art Deco Style&quot; /&gt; [[Aztec#Arts|Aztec Mexico]], and  [[African art|Africa]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Essential Art Deco&quot; /&gt; 

Much of this could be attributed to the popular interest in archaeology during the 1920s (e.g., the tomb of [[Tutankhamun]], [[Pompeii]], [[Troy]], etc.). Art Deco also used [[Machine Age]] and [[streamliner|streamline]] technologies&lt;ref name=&quot;Art Deco Study Guide&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/nal/guides/art_deco/index.html|title=Art Deco Study Guide|publisher=Victoria and Albert Museum|accessdate=7 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as modern [[aviation]], [[electric light]]ing, radio, [[ocean liner]]s and skyscrapers for inspiration.&lt;ref name=&quot;Essential Art Deco&quot; /&gt; [[Streamline Moderne]] was the final [[Interwar Period|interwar-period]] development, which most thoroughly manifests technology and has been rated by some commentators as a separate architectural style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.decopix.com/New%20Site/Pages/Directory%20Pages/Intro.html|title=Introduction to Art Deco|last=Juster|first=Randy|language=decopix.com|accessdate=7 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Art-deco design influences were expressed in the crystalline and faceted forms of decorative [[Cubism]] and [[Futurism (art)|Futurism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Art, Design and Visual Thinking&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Art, Design and Visual Thinking&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://char.txa.cornell.edu/art/decart/artdeco/artdeco.htm|title=Art, Design and Visual Thinking|last=Jirousek|first=Charlotte|year=1995|accessdate=7 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other popular themes of Art Deco were [[trapezoid]]al, zigzagged, geometric, and jumbled shapes,&lt;ref name=&quot;Art Deco Style&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Modern Style&quot; /&gt; which can be seen in many early works. Two great examples of these themes and styles are in Detroit, [[Michigan]]: the [[Fisher Building]] and the [[Guardian Building]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Savage|first=Rebecca|coauthors=Greg Kowalski|title=Art Deco in Detroit (Images of America)|publisher=Arcadia|year=2004|isbn=0738532282}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attributes==
Art Deco was an ornamental style, and its lavishness is attributed to reaction to the forced austerity imposed by World War I.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} It was suitable for modern contexts, including the [[Golden Gate Bridge]], interiors of cinema theaters (a prime example being the [[Paramount Theater (Oakland, California)|Paramount Theater]] in [[Oakland]], California) and [[ocean liner]]s such as the ''[[SS Île de France|Île de France]]'', ''[[RMS Queen Mary|Queen Mary]]'', and ''[[SS Normandie|Normandie]]''. Art Deco was used extensively in the United States for railway stations during the 1930s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agilitynut.com/train.html|title=Art Deco Train Stations|publisher=agilitynut.com|accessdate=7 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; designed to represent the modernity and efficiency of  railway trains. Around the world, a number of [[amusement parks]] were constructed with inter-war art-deco architecture, of which surviving examples include [[Playland (New York)]] and [[Luna Park Sydney]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sydneyarchitecture.com/NOR/NOR19.htm Luna Park] at Sydney Architecture Images&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Art Deco used many distinctive styles, but one of the most significant of its features was its dependence upon a range of ornaments and [[Motif (visual arts)|motif]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Essential Art Deco&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Wood|first=Ghislaine|title=Essential Art Deco|publisher=VA&amp;A Publications|location=London|page=21|chapter=Traditional Motifs |isbn=0821228331 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The style is said to have represented the cultural politics of its time, with [[eclecticism]] having been one of its defining features.&lt;ref name=&quot;Essential Art Deco&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Art Deco Style&quot; /&gt; In the words of [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]], the distinctive style of Art Deco was developed by 'all the nervous energy stored up and expended in the War'.&lt;ref name=&quot;Essential Art Deco&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Jazz Age&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Fitzgerald|first=F. Scott|title=The Jazz Age|location=New York|year=1996|page=3 |isbn=0760786305 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Art Deco has been influenced partly by styles such as [[Cubism]], Russian [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]] and Italian [[Futurism]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Art Deco Style&quot; /&gt; which are all evident in Art Deco decorative arts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyclopedia of Art Deco&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Duncan|first=Alastair|title=Encyclopedia of Art Deco|publisher=Headline Book Publishing |year= 1988 |isbn= 9780747200833 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Materials and design===
Art Deco is characterized by use of materials such as aluminium, [[stainless steel]], [[lacquer]], [[Bakelite]], Chrome and [[Inlay|inlaid]] wood.&lt;ref name=&quot;Design Handbook&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Design: A Concise History&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Art Deco Style&quot; /&gt; Exotic materials such as sharkskin ([[shagreen]]), and [[zebra]] skin were also evident.&lt;ref name=&quot;Design Handbook&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Art Deco Style&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Modern Style&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://artantiques.allinfo-about.com/weekly/features/artdeco.html|title= Art Deco - The Modern Style|last=Fisher|first=Carol|accessdate=30 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mschon.com/1920307.html|title=Art Deco: 1920 - 1930|last=Kapty|first=Patrick|year=1999|accessdate=30 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of stepped forms and geometric curves (unlike the sinuous, natural curves of [[Art Nouveau]]),&lt;ref name=&quot;Design: A Concise History&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Art Deco Jewelry&quot; /&gt; [[Chevron (insigne)|chevron]] patterns, ziggurat-shapes, fountains, and the [[Sunburst (design)|sunburst]] motif are typical of Art Deco. Some of these motifs were ubiquitous – for example, sunburst motifs were used in such varied contexts as women's shoes, [[Radiator (engine cooling)|radiator]] grilles, radio and clock faces, the auditorium of the [[Radio City Music Hall]], and the spire of the [[Chrysler Building]].

===Streamline Moderne===
{{main|Streamline Moderne}}
A related style named [[Streamline Moderne]], or simply Streamline, developed soon afterward.  Streamline was influenced by the modern aerodynamic designs,&lt;ref name=&quot;Design: A Concise History&quot; /&gt; including those developing from the advancing technologies of [[aviation]], [[ballistics]], and other applications requiring high velocity. The shapes resulting from scientifically applied [[Aerodynamics|aerodynamic]] principles were adopted for Art Deco, applying streamlining techniques to other useful objects of everyday life, such as cars.  The [[Chrysler Airflow]] design of 1933 was unsuccessful commercially,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Gartman | first = David | title = Auto opium | publisher = Routledge | year = 1994 | pages = 122–124 | isbn = 9780415105729}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the beauty of the design, being functional rather than simply added ornamentation, provided the precedent for more conservatively designed pseudo-streamlined vehicles.

Streamlining quickly influenced American and European [[Automotive design|automobile design]] and changed the appearance from the rectangular &quot;[[Brass Era car|horseless]] carriages&quot; into sleek vehicles with sweeping lines, [[symmetry]], and V-shapes that seemed to add to their suggestiveness of speed and efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.phxart.org/exhibition/exhibitioncurves.aspx |title=Curves of Steel: Streamlined Automobile Design |publisher=Phoenix Art Museum |year=2007 | accessdate=1 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nash Motors]] introduced the modern fully-unitized body ([[monocoque]]) design for the low-price market during 1941&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1941-1948-nash-ambassador.htm |title=1941-1948 Nash Ambassador |author=Auto Editors of ''Consumer Guide''| date=27 September 2007 | accessdate=1 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; that featured [[fastback]] “Slipstream” models with high prow-like [[Hood (vehicle)|hoods]], and art-deco &quot;speed lines&quot; for [[Chrome plating|chrome]] [[grille]]s and parallel bar trim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Armi | first = C. Edson |  title = The art of American car design | publisher = Pennsylvania State University Press | year = 1989 | page = 66 | isbn = 9780271004792}}&lt;/ref&gt; These aerodynamic-looking designs were applied by automakers and continued to be popular in the [[Supply and demand|sellers' market]] after World War 2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1941-1948-nash-ambassador4.htm |title=1947-1948 Nash |author= Auto Editors of ''Consumer Guide'' |date=27 September 2007 | accessdate=1 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; These &quot;streamlined&quot; forms began to be used for the design of mundane and static objects such as [[pencil sharpener]]s, [[refrigerator]]s,&lt;ref name=&quot;Design: A Concise History&quot; /&gt; and [[Fuel dispenser|gas pumps]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hinckley | first = James | title = The Big Book of Car Culture: The Armchair Guide to Automotive Americana | publisher = MotorBooks/MBI Publishing Company | year = 2005 | page = 239 | isbn =9780760319659}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Art Deco explicitly uses man-made materials (particularly glass, stainless steel and the new plastics),&lt;ref name=&quot;Design: A Concise History&quot; /&gt; symmetry,&lt;ref name=&quot;Art Deco Jewelry&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.studiosoft.it/AntJewelryDeco.htm|title=Art Deco Jewelry|year=2007|publisher=StudioSoft|accessdate=30 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and repetition, modified by some Asian influences such as the use of silks and Middle Eastern designs. It was adopted strongly in the United States during the [[Great Depression]] due to its practicality and simplicity, while still suggesting a reminder of better times.&lt;ref name=&quot;University Times&quot; /&gt;

Eliminating elements that cluttered a given building, painting, or chair was the emphasis of this new development of streamlining. This simplicity is realized by the use of symmetrical geometric forms.

===Consumer products===
[[File:Duofold Desk Set.jpg|thumb|left|upright|1930 [[Parker Pen Company|Parker]] [[Duofold]] desk set]]

Art deco was a popular style used for consumer products such as furniture, china, lamps, cars, jewelry, watches, ash trays, and more.

==Decline and resurgence==
Art Deco slowly lost patronage in the West after becoming mass-produced, when it began to be derided as gaudy and presenting a false image of luxury. Eventually, the style was ended by the austerities of World War II. Before destruction during World War II, [[Manila]] possessed many art-deco buildings, a legacy of the American colonial past. 

A resurgence of interest in Art Deco began during the 1960s,&lt;ref name=&quot;Design Handbook&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Art Deco Style&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Art Deco (1920s to 1930s)&quot; /&gt; and then again during the 1980s with the increasing interest in [[graphic design]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Design Handbook&quot; /&gt; Its association with &quot;[[film noir]]&quot; and 1930s [[glamour (presentation)|glamour]] resulted in its use for advertisements for jewelry and fashion and toiletries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.library.unsw.edu.au/~thesis/adt-NUN/uploads/approved/adt-NUN20060515.093519/public/02whole.pdf|title=''The Decorative in Twentieth Century Art: A Story of Decline and Resurgence''|author=Pamela Gaunt|date=August 2005|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Surviving examples==
===United States===
The US has some good examples of art-deco architecture.  New York, Chicago, and Detroit have a great many art deco buildings: The famous skyscrapers are the best-known, but notable art deco buildings can be found in various neighborhoods.  Detroit's many examples of art-deco architecture include the [[Fisher Building|Fisher]] and [[Guardian Building|Guardian]] Buildings both of which are now [[National Historic Landmark]]s.  Los Angeles, California, also has much art-deco architecture, in particular along [[Wilshire Boulevard]], a main thoroughfare that experienced a period of intense construction activity during the 1920s. Notable examples include the [[Bullocks Wilshire]] building and the [[Pellissier Building and Wiltern Theatre]], built during 1929 and 1931 respectively. Both buildings experienced recent restoration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bigorangelandmarks.blogspot.com/2007/08/no-56-bullocks-wilshire-building.html|title=Big Orange Landmarks No.56|last=Bariscale|first=Floyd|year=2007|accessdate=15 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bigorangelandmarks.blogspot.com/2008/02/no-118-pellissier-building.html|title=Big Orange Landmarks No.118|last=Bariscale|first=Floyd|year=2008|accessdate=15 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Miami Beach, Florida]], has a large collection of art-deco buildings, with some thirty blocks of hotels and apartment houses dating from the 1920s to the 1940s. During 1979, the [[Miami Beach Architectural District]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mdpl.org/ Miami Design Preservation League]&lt;/ref&gt; was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. Nearly all the buildings have been restored and painted in their original pastel colors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.miamibeach-usa.com/miami-beach-art-deco/|title=Miami Beach Art Deco|last=Brown|first=Joseph|year=2009|publisher=Miami Beach Magazine|accessdate=15 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fair Park]], located in Dallas, Texas, is a large collection of Art Deco structures. Much of the Art Deco heritage of [[Tulsa, Oklahoma|Tulsa]], Oklahoma remains from that city's [[History of Tulsa, Oklahoma#Second main era of oil production: 1915-1930|oil boom days]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tulsapreservationcommission.org/artdeco/|title=Tulsa’s Art Deco Heritage|year=2008|publisher=Tulsa Reservation Commission|accessdate=7 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Houston]], Texas has some buildings surviving, such as the [[Houston City Hall]], the [[JPMorgan Chase Building (Houston, Texas)|JPMorgan Chase Building]], [[Ezekiel W. Cullen Building]], and the [[1940 Air Terminal Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.houstondeco.org |title=Houston Deco |publisher=Houston Deco |date= |accessdate=8 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Beaumont, Texas|Beaumont]], the [[Jefferson County Courthouse (Texas)|Jefferson County Courthouse]], [[Kyle Building]] and the [[First National Bank Building (Beaumont, Texas)|First National Bank Building]] are some of the few Art Deco buildings still in the city.

[[Hoover Dam]] is a somewhat unusual example of Art Deco design. Many dam guides state that the design was to be [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]], including the installation of gargoyles with water shooting out of their mouths.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

[[Kansas City]] is home to the [[Kansas City Power and Light Building]], which was completed during 1931. This building is a good example of the [[Great Depression]] and its effect on Art Deco construction. Original plans were for a twin tower to be built next to it on its west side. However, it was never built due to financial constraints. As a result, the {{convert|476|ft|m|adj=on}} tower has a bare west side, with no windows. Other examples of Art Deco buildings in Kansas City include [[Municipal Auditorium (Kansas City)]], the [[Jackson County Courthouse (Kansas City, Missouri)]], [[Kansas City City Hall]]; and [[909 Walnut]].

[[Cincinnati, Ohio]] houses the [[Cincinnati Museum Center at Union Terminal|Cincinnati Union Terminal]], an Art Deco style passenger railroad station that began operation during 1933. After the decrease of railroad travel, most of the building was converted to other uses. It now serves as the Cincinnati Museum Center, which serves more than one million visitors per year and is the 17th most visited museum in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cincymuseum.org/explore_our_sites/union_terminal/history/ |title=Cincinnati Union Terminal - History |accessdate=3 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cincymuseum.org/information_center/press_room/press_releases/nationalmedal.asp |title=Cincinnati Museum Center Receives Nation’s Highest Award for Community Service |accessdate=3 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cincinnati is also home to the [[Carew Tower]], a 49-story Art Deco skyscraper built during 1931.

During 2005, the largest residential restoration project in the country and the largest collection of Art Deco buildings in [[New Jersey]] began at the {{convert|14|acre|m2|adj=on}} site of the former [[Beacon, Jersey City|Jersey City Medical Center]]. The conversion of the national historic site to a residential enclave had as of 2009 been completed on three of the several buildings on the site.


===Latin America===
[[File:Kavanagh.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Kavanagh Building]], [[Buenos Aires]]. 1934 design by Gregorio Sánchez, Ernesto Lagos, Luis María de la Torre]]
Some of the finest surviving examples of Art Deco art and architecture are found in Cuba, especially in [[Havana]]. The Bacardi Building is noted for its particular art deco style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.puertorico-herald.org/issues2/2005/vol09n18/Bacardi.html|title=Bacardi Building Sports Spirited Design|last=Fernandez|first=Enrique|year=2005|publisher=Miami Herald|accessdate=4 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The style is expressed by the architecture of residences, businesses, hotels, and many pieces of decorative art, furniture, and utensils in public buildings, as well as in private homes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hillier2&quot;/&gt;

Another country with many examples of Art Deco architecture is Brazil, especially in [[Porto Alegre]], [[Goiânia]] and cities like [[Cipó]] ([[Bahia]]), [[Iraí]] ([[Rio Grande do Sul]]) and [[Rio de Janeiro]], especially in [[Copacabana (Rio de Janeiro)|Copacabana]]. Also in the Brazilian Northeast – notably in countryside cities, such as [[Campina Grande]] in the state of [[Paraiba]] – there is a noticeable group of Art Deco buildings, which has been termed “Sertanejo Art Deco” because of its peculiar architectural features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://art-deco-sertanejo.com/english//|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20041207160622/http://art-deco-sertanejo.com/english//|archivedate=7 December 2004|title=Art Deco Sertanejo|last=Rossi|first=Lia|coauthors=José Marconi de Souza|year=2002|accessdate=7 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for the style being so widespread in Brazil is its coincidence with the fast growth and radical economic changes of the country during 1930-1940. 

In [[Santiago, Chile]], Hotel Carrera (no longer a hotel) is a very fine example of Art Deco architecture. Art deco buildings are also numerous in [[Montevideo]], Uruguay, including the [[Palacio Salvo]], which was South America's tallest building when it was built during the late 1920s. 

In Argentina, architect [[Alejandro Virasoro]] introducted Art Deco during 1926 and developed the use of reinforced concrete, with the Banco El Hogar Argentino and the Casa del Teatro (both in [[Buenos Aires]]) being his most important works. [[Edificio Kavanagh]] (1934), by Sánchez, Lagos and de la Torre, was the tallest reinforced concrete structure at its time, and a notable case of late Art Deco style. In the [[Buenos Aires Province]], architect [[Francisco Salamone]] left  cemetery portals, city halls and slaughterhouses commissioned by provincial government during 1930s, designed in a personal style which combined Art Deco with futurism. In [[Rosario, Santa Fe]], the [[Palacio Minetti]] is the most representative Art Deco piece.

[[File:Du Cane Court 184.jpg|thumb|Massive [[Du Cane Court]], 1937 Art Deco landmark in Balham, south-west London]]

In London, the former [[Arsenal Stadium]] has the famous East Stand facade.  It remains at the [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal football club]]'s old home at [[Highbury]], [[London Borough of Islington]], which was vacated during the summer of 2006. Opened during October 1936, the structure now has [[Listed building|Grade II listed status]] and has been converted into apartments. William Bennie, the organizer of the project, famously used the Art Deco style in the final design which was considered one of the most opulent and impressive stands of world football. The [[London Underground]] is also famous for many examples of Art Deco architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b00npm4g/Art_Deco_Icons_London_Transport |title=Four Programmes - Art Deco Icons |publisher=BBC |date=14 November 2009 |accessdate=8 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Du Cane Court, in Balham, south-west London, is a good example of the art deco style. It was reckoned to be possibly the largest block of privately-owned apartments under one roof in Britain at the time it was built, and the first to employ pre-stressed concrete. It has a grand reception area and is surrounded by Japanese-style gardens; and it has had many famous residents, especially from the performing arts. 
[[Valencia, Spain]] was built profusely in Art Deco style during the period of economic bounty between wars in which Spain remained neutral. Particularly remarkable are the famous bath house Las Arenas, the building hosting the Rectorship of the [[University of Valencia]] and the cinemas Rialto (currently the Filmoteca de la [[Generalitat Valenciana]]), Capitol (reconverted into an office building) and Metropol.

As a result of the inter-war period of rapid development, cities in Romania have numerous Art Deco buildings, including government buildings, hotels, and private houses. The best representative in this regard is the capital, [[Bucharest]], which, despite the widespread destruction of its architecture during [[Communism_in_Romania#Heavy_industrialisation|Communist times]], still has many Art Deco examples, both on its main boulevards and in the lesser known parts of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rezistenta.net/2010/08/perspective-21-art-deco-bucurestean.html |title=Bucharest Art Deco |date=5 August 2010 |accessdate=12 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bucharestunknown.blogspot.com/2010/05/arhitectura-interbelica-modernista-in.html |title=Inter-war modernist arhitecture |date=21 May 2010 |accessdate=12 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bucharestunknown.blogspot.com/2010/03/bijuterii-art-deco-in-bucuresti.html |title=Art Deco jewels in Bucharest  |date=8 May 2010 |accessdate=12 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ploieşti]] also has many Art Deco houses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.republicaploiesti.net/2010/08/art-deco-ploiestean-i.html |title=Art Deco in Ploiesti |date=7 August 2010 |accessdate=12 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the largest Art Deco buildings in Western Europe is the [[Basilica of the Sacred Heart, Brussels|Basilica of the Sacred Heart]] in Koekelberg, [[Brussels]]. During 1925, architect Albert van Huffel won the Grand Prize for Architecture with his scale model of the basilica at the ''Exposition Internationale des Arts Décoratifs et Industriels Modernes'' in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.basilicakoekelberg.be/documents/home.xml?lang=en Basilica of the Sacred Heart, Koekelberg]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Indonesia, the largest stock of [[Dutch East Indies]] era buildings are in the large cities of [[Java]]. [[Bandung]] is of particular note with one of the largest remaining collections of 1920s Art Deco buildings in the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Dawson| first = B. | last2 = Gillow | first2 = J. | title = The Traditional Architecture of Indonesia | publisher = Thames and Hudson Ltd | year = 1994  | location = London | isbn = 0-500-34132-X  | page = 25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with the notable work of several Dutch architects and planners, including [[Albert Aalbers]] that added the expressionist architecture style to the Art Deco by designing the DENIS bank (1936) and renovated the [[Savoy Homann Bidakara Hotel|Savoy Homann Hotel]] (1939), [[Thomas Karsten]], Henri Maclaine-Pont, J Gerber and [[Wolff Schoemaker|C.P.W. Schoemaker]]. The Sociëteit Concordia (now [[Merdeka Building]]) is a historic building in Bandung designed by Van Galen Last and C.P. Wolff Schoemaker, hosted [[Asian–African Conference]] during 1955. In Jakarta, the Nederlandsche Handel Maatschappij building (1929), now Museum Bank Mandiri, by J de Bryun, AP Smiths, and C Van de Linde, and right across it, the [[Jakarta Kota Station]] (1929) designed by Frans Johan Louwrens Ghijsels, and [[Metropole, Jakarta|Metropole]] cinema in Menteng area are the surviving Art Deco buildings in [[Jakarta]]. 

In China, at least sixty buildings designed by Hungarian architect [[Laszlo Hudec]] survive in downtown Shanghai of which many are Art Deco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historic-shanghai.com/?p=7|title=Year of Hudec|accessdate=18 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Japan, the 1933 [[Tokyo Metropolitan Teien Art Museum|residence]] of [[Prince Asaka Yasuhiko|Prince Asaka]] in Tokyo is an Art Deco house turned museum.  

The [[Manila Metropolitan Theater]] located along P.Burgos Street in [[Manila]] is one of the few existing art deco buildings in the Philippines Islands.

===Oceania===
====New Zealand====
The town of [[Napier, New Zealand|Napier]], New Zealand, was rebuilt in the Art Deco style after being largely razed by the [[1931 Hawke's Bay earthquake|Hawke's Bay earthquake]] of 3 February 1931 and is the world's most consistently art deco city. Although a few Art Deco buildings were replaced with contemporary structures during the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, most of the centre remained intact long enough to become recognized as architecturally unique, and from the 1990s onwards had been protected and restored. As of 2007, Napier has been nominated for UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]] status, the first cultural site in New Zealand to be nominated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artdeconapier.com/Earthquake_8.aspx |title=Napier Earthquake |publisher=Artdeconapier.com |date=3 February 1931 |accessdate=8 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artdeconapier.com/ |title=Home - Art Deco Trust |publisher=Artdeconapier.com |date= |accessdate=8 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the [[World Heritage Trust]], when Napier is compared to the other cites noted for their art deco architecture, such as Miami Beach, Santa Barbara, [[Bandung]] in Indonesia (planned originally as the future capital of Java), and Asmara in Eritrea (built by the Italians as a model colonial city), &quot;none... surpass Napier in style and coherence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5125/ |title=Napier Art Deco historic precinct - UNESCO World Heritage Centre |publisher=Whc.unesco.org |date= |accessdate=8 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:RussellStreetPoliceHQ.JPG|thumb|Former [[Russell Street Police Headquarters]], 1936, Melbourne, Australia]] 

[[Hastings, New Zealand|Hastings]] was also rebuilt in Art Deco style after the [[1931 Hawke's Bay earthquake]], and many fine art deco buildings survive.

[[Wellington, New Zealand|Wellington]] has retained a sizeable number of Art Deco buildings, in spite of constant post-[[World War II]] development. [http://www.wellington.govt.nz/services/heritage/pdfs/artdeco.pdf]

====Australia====
Australia also has many surviving examples of Art Deco architecture. Among the most notable are 'mini-skyscrapers' such as the [[Grace Building (Sydney)]] and the [[Manchester Unity Building]] (Melbourne) featuring purely decorative towers to circumvent the [[height restriction laws]] of the time. The Former [[Russell Street Police Headquarters]], also in Melbourne, was for many years the headquarters of the [[Victoria Police]] before they were relocated to [[William Street, Melbourne|William Street]] about 1990.  The main multi-storey brick building located on the west of the site was constructed 1940-1943 in the Art Deco style by architect [[Percy Edgar Everett]] and is reminiscent of the design of the Empire State Building.

===Africa===
Africa's most celebrated examples of Art Deco were built in Eritrea during [[Eritrea#Colonialism|Italian rule]]. Many buildings survive in [[Asmara]], the capital, and elsewhere. 
[[File:Asmara-cinema Impero.jpeg|thumb|right|260px|Cinema Impero, built in 1937, Asmara, Eritrea]]
Also there are many buildings in downtown [[Casablanca]], Morocco's economic capital. During [[Portugal|Portuguese]] colonial rule in [[Angola]] and [[Mozambique]], a large number of buildings were erected especially in the capital cities of [[Luanda]] and [[Maputo]]. Cities in South Africa also contain examples of art-deco design such as the City Hall, in [[Benoni, Gauteng]], constructed during 1937. There are a few art deco buildings in Egypt, one of the most famous being the former Cadillac dealership in downtown Cairo.

'''ASCII art''' is a [[graphic design]] technique that uses [[computer]]s for presentation and consists of pictures pieced together from the 95 printable (from a total of 128) [[character (computing)|characters]] defined by the [[ASCII]] Standard from 1963 and ASCII compliant character sets with proprietary extended characters (beyond the 128 characters of standard [[7-bit ASCII]]&lt;!-- leave it as 7-bit for accuracy --&gt;). The term is also loosely used to refer to [[#Other text-based art|text based art in general]]. ASCII art can be created with any [[text editor]], and is often used with [[free-form language]]s. Most examples of ASCII [[art]] require a [[typeface#Proportion|fixed-width font]] (non-proportional [[typeface|fonts]], as on a traditional [[typewriter]]) such as [[Courier (typeface)|Courier]] for presentation.

[[Image:Arambilet ASCII Art.jpg|thumb|[[Arambilet]]:''ARTE ASCII/ASCII ART'']]

Among the oldest known examples of ASCII art are the
creations by computer-art pioneer [[Kenneth Knowlton]] from around 1966, who was working for [[Bell Labs]] at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;cgihist&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Carlson|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Studies in Perception I&quot; by Ken Knowlton and Leon Harmon from 1966 shows some examples of their early ASCII art.&lt;ref name=sip1&gt;{{Harvnb|Carlson|2003}} &quot;1966 Studies in Perception I by Ken Knowlton and Leon Harmon (Bell Labs)&quot;, [http://design.osu.edu/carlson/history/tree/images/bell.jpg Image of Studies in Perception I]&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the main reasons ASCII art was born was because early printers often lacked graphics ability and thus characters were used in place of graphic marks. Also, to mark divisions between different print jobs from different users, bulk printers often used ASCII art to print large banners, making the division easier to spot so that the results could be more easily separated by a computer operator or clerk. ASCII art was also used in early e-mail when images could not be embedded.

==History==
===Typewriter art===
Since 1867 typewriters have been used for creating visual art. The oldest known preserved example of typewriter art is a picture of a butterfly made in 1898 by Flora Stacey.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stark|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Robert|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1954 short film ''[[Stamp Day for Superman]]'', typewriter art was a feature of the plot.

===TTY and RTTY===
TTY stands for &quot;TeleTYpe&quot; or &quot;TeleTYpewriter&quot; and is also known as [[Teleprinter]] or Teletype.
RTTY stands for [[Radioteletype]]. According to a chapter in the &quot;RTTY Handbook&quot;,&lt;ref name=rttyhb&gt;{{Harvnb|Green|1972}}&lt;/ref&gt; text images have been sent via teletypewriter as early as 1923. However, none of the &quot;old&quot; RTTY art has been discovered yet. What is known is that text images appeared frequently on radio teletype in the 1960s and the 1970s.&lt;ref name=&quot;joan&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Stark|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rtty.com/gallery/rttyeasy.htm RTTY Art Made Easy, RTTY Journal November 1970]&lt;/ref&gt;

===ASCII art===
[[Image:ASCII full.svg|frame|There are 95 printable ASCII characters, numbered 32 to 126.]]
The widespread usage of ASCII art can be traced to the computer [[bulletin board systems]] of the late 1970s and early 1980s. The limitations of computers of that time period necessitated the use of text characters to represent images. Along with ASCII's use in communication, however, it also began to appear in the underground online art groups of the period. An ASCII comic is a form of webcomic which uses ASCII text to create images. In place of images in a regular comic, ASCII art is used, with the text or dialog usually placed underneath.

During the 1990s, graphical browsing and [[variable-width]] [[Computer font|fonts]] became increasingly popular, leading to a decline in ASCII art.  Despite this, ASCII art continued to survive through online [[MUD]]s, an acronym for &quot;Multi-User Dungeon&quot;, (which are textual [[Multiplayer game|multiplayer]] [[role-playing video game]]s), [[Internet Relay Chat]], [[E-mail]], [[message boards]] and other forms of online communication which commonly employ the needed [[fixed-width]].

Over the years, [[warez]] groups began to get into the ASCII art scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Necromancer|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Warez groups usually release [[.nfo]] files with their software, [[Software cracking|cracks]] or general illegal software reverse-engineering releases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Defacto2|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ASCII art will usually include the warez group's name and maybe some ASCII borders on the outsides of the release notes, etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defacto2.net/documents.cfm NFO Files collection at Defacto2.net, with NFO files that date back to 1989], retrieved February 17, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
[[Image:ASCII Panzer unt Sattelzug.png|right|thumb|A self-propelled gun and truck made using ASCII art]]
ASCII art is used wherever text can be more readily printed or transmitted than graphics, or in some cases, where the transmission of pictures is not possible. This includes typewriters, [[teletype]]s, non-graphic [[computer terminal]]s, [[printer separator]]s, in early [[computer network]]ing (e.g., [[bulletin board system|BBSes]]), [[e-mail]], and [[Usenet]] news messages. ASCII art is also used within the [[source code]] of computer programs for representation of company or product logos, and flow control or other diagrams. In some cases, the entire source code of a program is a piece of ASCII art &amp;mdash; for instance, an entry to one of the earlier [[International Obfuscated C Code Contest]] is a program that adds numbers, but visually looks like a binary adder drawn in logic ports.

Examples of ASCII-style art predating the modern computer era can be found in the June 1939, July 1948 and October 1948 editions of Popular Mechanics.&lt;ref name=&quot;popscience&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Cumbrowski|2007b}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;0verkill&quot; is a 2D platform multiplayer shooter game designed entirely in colour ASCII art. [[MPlayer]] and [[VLC media player]] can display videos as ASCII art. ASCII art is used in the making of DOS-based [[ZZT]] games.

Many game walkthrough guides come as part of a basic .txt file; this file often contains the name of the game in ASCII art. Such as below, word art is created using backslashes and other ASCII values in order to create the illusion of 3D.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}&lt;!-- need source for illustration --&gt;  Below is the title [[Metal Gear Solid]] in the style of ASCII art.

== Types and styles ==
Different techniques could be used in ASCII art to obtain different artistic effects:

 .--.     /\
 '--'    /__\    (^..^)~

- Line art, for creating shapes

 .g@8g.  db
 'Y8@P' d88b
- Solid art, for creating filled shapes

 :$#$: &quot;4b. ':.
 :$#$:   &quot;4b. ':.

- Shading, using different symbol density and shading for creating gradients or contrasts

   |\_/|        ****************************
  / @ @ \       *  &quot;Purrrfectly pleasant&quot;  *
 ( &gt; º &lt; )      *       Poppy Prinz        *
  `»»x««´       *       (pprinz@...)       *
  /  O  \       ****************************

- combinations used as SIG (signature) at the end of an email

=== Emoticons and verticons ===
{{Main|Emoticon}}
The simplest forms of ASCII art are combinations of two or three characters for expressing emotion in text.  They are commonly referred to as '[[emoticon]]', 'smilie', or '[[smiley]]

There is another type of one-line ASCII art that does not require the mental rotation of pictures, which is widely known in Japan as [[Emoticon#East Asian style|kaomoji]] (literally &quot;face characters&quot;.) Traditionally, they are referred to as &quot;ASCII face &quot;.

More complex examples use several lines of text to draw large symbols or more complex figures.

====Popular smileys====
{{Main|List of common emoticons}}
The list only shows some popular examples for demonstration purposes. Hundreds of different text smileys were developed over time,&lt;ref name=smileys2&gt;{{Harvnb|textfiles|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; but only a few were generally accepted, used and understood.

===Styles of the computer underground text art scene===
====Atari 400/800 ATASCII====
The [[Atari 8-bit family|Atari 400/800]] did not follow the ASCII standard and had its own character set, called [[ATASCII]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Štěrba|2005}} (gif image)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Moeser|Fusik|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The emergence of ATASCII art coincided with the growing popularity of [[Bulletin board system|BBS Systems]] caused by availability of the [[acoustic coupler]]s that were compatible with the 8-bit home computers. ATASCII text animations are also referred to as &quot;break animations&quot; by the Atari sceners.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

====C-64 PETSCII====
The [[Commodore 64]], which was released in 1982, also did not follow the ASCII standard. The C-64 character set is called [[PETSCII]], an extended form of [[ASCII|ASCII-1963]]. As with the Atari's ATASCII art, C-64 fans developed a similar scene that used PETSCII for their creations.

====&quot;Block ASCII&quot; / &quot;High ASCII&quot; style ASCII art on the IBM PC====
[[Image:ASCII notepad acidview compare.png|right|200px|thumbnail|Block ASCII display via Notepad versus ACiDView for Windows]]
So-called &quot;block ASCII&quot; or &quot;high ASCII&quot; uses the extended characters of the 8-bit [[code page 437]], which is a proprietary standard introduced by [[IBM]] in 1979 (ANSI Standard x3.16) for the IBM PC and MS DOS operating system. &quot;Block ASCIIs&quot; were widely used on the PC during the 1990s until the Internet replaced BBSes as the main communication platform. Until then, &quot;block ASCIIs&quot; dominated the [[Computer art scene|PC Text Art Scene]].&lt;ref name=&quot;asciistyles&quot;&gt;[http://www.RoySAC.com/roy-sac_styles_of_underground_text_art.asp The three Styles of the Underground ASCII Art Scene], Article 01, 2006, Roy/[[Superior Art Creations|SAC]], [http://www.RoySAC.com RoySAC.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ddarthistory&quot;&gt;[http://cd.textfiles.com/darkdomain/www/html/history-art_scene.html An Abbreviated History of the Underground Computer Art Scene] by Napalm, 11/10/1998, The History of Art and Technology&lt;/ref&gt;

The first art scene group that focused on the extended character set of the PC in their art work was called &quot;Aces of ANSI Art,&quot; or &quot;AAA.&quot; Some members of left in 1990, and formed a group called [[ACiD Productions|ACiD]], &quot;ANSI Creators in Demand.&quot; In that same year the second major underground art scene group was founded, [[iCE Advertisements|ICE]], &quot;Insane Creators Enterprise&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;100years&quot;&gt;[http://www.cow.net/conned/notacon/artscene/notacon-100artscene-transcript.txt 100 YEARS OF THE COMPUTER ART SCENE], Presented by [[Jason Scott Sadofsky]] and [[RaD Man]] ([[ACiD Productions|ACiD]]), [[Notacon]] Conference - Cleveland, Ohio, USA, April 23-25th, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

There is some debate between ASCII and block ASCII artist, with &quot;Hardcore&quot; ASCII artists maintaining that block ASCII art is in fact [[ANSI art]], because it does not use the 128 characters of the original ASCII standard. On the other hand, block ASCII artists argue that if their art uses only characters of the computers character set, then it is to be called ASCII, regardless if the character set is proprietary or not.&lt;!--original sentence was entirely ungrammatical; I hope this one gets the proper meaning across--&gt;

Microsoft Windows does not support the [[American National Standards Institute|ANSI Standard]] x3.16. One can view block ASCIIs with a text editor using the font &quot;[[Terminal (font)|Terminal]]&quot;, but it will not look exactly as it was intended by the artist. With a special ASCII/ANSI viewer, such as ACiDView for Windows (see ASCII and ANSI art viewers), one can see block ASCII and ANSI files properly. An example that [[#.22Block.22 ASCII art|illustrates the difference]] in appearance is part of this article. Alternatively, one could look at the file using the Type command in the command prompt.

====&quot;Amiga&quot;/&quot;Oldskool&quot; style ASCII art====
[[Image:Paso-IceCream-AmigaVsPC.png|right|200px|thumbnail|Oldschool/Amiga ASCII look on Commodore Amiga Computer versus look on the IBM PC (notice the tight spacing)]]
In the art scene one popular ASCII style that used the 7-bit standard ASCII character set was the so called &quot;Oldskool&quot; Style. It is also called &quot;Amiga style&quot;, due to its origin and widespread use on the [[Amiga|Commodore Amiga]] Computers. The style uses primarily the characters: &lt;tt&gt;_/\-+=.()&lt;&gt;:&lt;/tt&gt;. The &quot;oldskool&quot; art looks more like the outlined drawings of shapes than real pictures.
This is an example of &quot;[[Amiga]] style&quot; (also referred to as &quot;old school&quot; or &quot;oldskool&quot; style) [[computer art scene|scene]] ASCII art.&lt;ref name=&quot;asciistyles&quot; /&gt;

The Amiga ASCII Scene surfaced in 1992, 7 years after the introduction of the Commodore [[Amiga 1000]]. The Commodore 64 PETSCII scene did not make the transition to the Commodore Amiga as the C64 demo and warez scenes did. Among the first Amiga ASCII art groups were ART, Epsilon Design, Upper Class, Unreal. This means that the text art scene on the Amiga was actually younger than the text art scene on the PC. The Amiga artists also did not call their ASCII art style &quot;Oldskool&quot;. That term was introduced on the PC. When and by whom is unknown and lost in history.

The Amiga style ASCII artwork was most often released in the form of a single text file, which included all the artwork (usually requested), with some design parts in between, as opposed to the PC art scene where the art work was released as a [[ZIP archive]] with separate text files for each piece. Furthermore, the releases were usually called &quot;ASCII collections&quot; and not &quot;art packs&quot; like on the IBM PC.

&lt;/pre&gt;
This kind of ASCII art is hand made in a text editor. Popular editors used to make this kind of ASCII art include [[CygnusEd]]itor aka CED ([[Amiga]]) and [[EditPlus|EditPlus2]] ([[Wintel|PC]]).

====Newskool style ASCII art====
[[Image:Roy-csnewskool.png|right|200px|thumbnail|Newskool ASCII Screenshot]]
&quot;Newskool&quot; is a popular form of ASCII art which capitalizes on character strings like  &quot;$#Xxo&quot;.  In spite of its name, the style is not &quot;new&quot;; on the contrary, it was very old but fell out of favor and was replaced by &quot;Oldskool&quot; and &quot;Block&quot; style ASCII art. It was dubbed &quot;Newskool&quot; upon its comeback and renewed popularity at the end of the 1990s.&lt;ref name=&quot;asciistyles&quot; /&gt;

Newskool changed significantly as the result of the introduction of [[Character encoding|extended proprietary characters]]. The classic 7-bit standard ASCII characters remain predominant, but the extended characters are often used for &quot;fine tuning&quot; and &quot;tweaking&quot;. The style developed further after the introduction and adaptation of [[Unicode]].

==Methods for generating ASCII art==
{{Main|List of text editors#ASCII and ANSI art}}

While some prefer to use a simple [[text editor]] to produce ASCII art, specialized programs have been developed that often simulate the features and tools in bitmap image editors. For Block ASCII art and ANSI art the artist almost always uses a special text editor, because the required characters are not available on a standard keyboard.

The special text editors have sets of special characters assigned to existing keys on the keyboard. Popular MS DOS based editors, such as TheDraw and ACiDDraw had multiple sets of different special characters mapped to the F-Keys to make the use of those characters easier for the artist who can switch between individual sets of characters via basic keyboard shortcuts. PabloDraw is one of the very few special ASCII/ANSI art editors that were developed for MS Windows XP.

===Image to text conversion===
{{Main|ASCII art converters}}

Other programs allow one to automatically convert an image to text characters, which is a special case of [[vector quantization]]. A method is to sample the image down to [[grayscale]] with less than [[integer (computer science)|8-bit]] precision, and then assign a character for each value.

Examples of converted images are given below.

This is one of the earliest forms of ASCII art, dating back to the early days of the 1960s [[minicomputer]]s and [[teletype]]s. During the 1970s it was popular in [[shopping mall|malls]] to get a [[t-shirt]] with a photograph printed in ASCII art on it from an automated kiosk manned by a computer. With the advent of the web and [[HTML]] and [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]], many ASCII conversion programs will now quantize to a full [[RGB]] colorspace, enabling colorized ASCII images.

Since the appearance of the first simple converter tools, individuals have converted images to ASCII art automatically and afterwards claimed that they generated the result themselves &quot;by hand&quot; via a text editor.

Images that were converted to text, where no touch up work was done after the conversion, can in almost every case be identified as such, at least by an experienced text artist. The detection of converted, software-generated text art becomes much more difficult if some time was spent by the editor to touch up the details that are typical indicators of auto-generation.  The inconsistencies in &quot;shading&quot; in just one art piece are often what gives the software-created status away.

|}
&lt;/center&gt;

Still images or movies can also be converted to ASCII on various Linux and UNIX computers using the [http://aa-project.sourceforge.net/aalib aalib (black and white)] or [http://sam.zoy.org/libcaca libcaca (colour)] graphics device driver, or the VLC media player; all of which render the screen using ASCII symbols instead of pixels.  See also [http://oreilly.com/pub/h/4441 O'Reilly article &quot;Watch Videos in ASCII art&quot;].

==Non fixed-width ASCII==
Most ASCII art is created using a [[monospace font]], where all characters are identical in width ([[Courier (typeface)|Courier]] is a popular monospace font). Early computers in use when ASCII art came into vogue had monospace fonts for screen and printer displays. Today most of the more commonly used fonts in word processors, web browsers and other programs are proportional fonts, such as [[Helvetica]] or [[Times Roman]], where different widths are used for different characters. ASCII art drawn for a fixed width font will usually appear distorted, or even unrecognizable when displayed in a proportional font.

Some ASCII artists have produced art for display in proportional fonts. These ASCIIs, rather than using a purely shade-based correspondence, use characters for slopes and borders and use block shading. These ASCIIs generally offer greater precision and attention to detail than fixed-width ASCIIs for a lower character count, although they are not as universally accessible since they are usually relatively font-specific.

==Animated ASCII art==
Animated ASCII art started in 1970  from so-called VT100 animations produced on [[vt100]] terminals. These animations were simply text with cursor movement instructions, deleting and erasing the characters necessary to appear animated. Usually, they represented a long hand-crafted process undertaken by a single person to tell a story.

Contemporary [[web browser]] revitalized animated ASCII art again. It became possible to display animated ASCII art via [[JavaScript]] or [[Java (Sun)|Java applets]]. Static ASCII art pictures are loaded and displayed one after another, creating the animation, very similar to how movie projectors  unreel film reel and project the individual pictures on the big screen at movie theaters. A new term was born: ''ASCIImation'' - another name of Animated ASCII Art. A seminal work in this arena is the Star Wars ASCIImation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

   |accessdate=2008-11-18
}}&lt;/ref&gt; More complicated routines in JavaScript generate more elaborate ASCIImations showing effects like [[Morphing]] effects, star field emulations, fading effects and calculated images, such as [[Mandelbrot set|mandelbrot fractal]] animations.&lt;ref name=&quot;asciimation1&quot;&gt;[http://www.roysac.com/skylined-Morph-ASCIIanimationFrame.asp ASCII Animation &quot;Morph&quot; by SkyLined (using JavaScript)] includes morph effects and mandelbrot fractal animation&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;asciimation2&quot;&gt;[http://www.roysac.com/skylined-Starfield-ASCIIanimationFrame.asp ASCII Animation Starfield by SkyLined (using JavaScript)] includes fading effect and horizontal scrolling star field emulation&lt;/ref&gt;

There are now many tools and programs that can transform raster images into text symbols; some of these tools can operate on streaming video. For example, the music video for pop singer [[Beck Hansen]]'s song &quot;Black Tambourine&quot;&lt;ref name=beckbt&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ncgg4eGYO0 Black Tambourine] ASCIImation Music Video by [[Beck Hansen]] at [[YouTube.com]]&lt;/ref&gt; is made up entirely of ASCII characters that approximate the original footage.

==Other text-based art==
There are a variety of other types of art using text symbols from character sets other than ASCII and/or some form of color coding. Despite not being pure ASCII, these are still often referred to as &quot;ASCII art&quot;. The character set portion designed specifically for drawing is known as the line drawing characters or [[pseudo-graphics]].

===ANSI art===
{{Main|ANSI art}}
The IBM PC graphics hardware in text mode uses 16 bits per character. It supports a variety of configurations, but in its default mode under DOS they are used to give 256 glyphs from one of the IBM PC code pages ([[Code page 437]] by default), 16 foreground colors, 8 background colors, and a flash option. Such art can be loaded into screen memory directly. ANSI.SYS, if loaded, also allows such art to be placed on screen by outputting escape sequences that indicate movements of the screen cursor and color/flash changes. If this method is used then the art becomes known as [[ANSI art]]. The IBM PC code pages also include characters intended for simple drawing which often made this art appear much cleaner than that made with more traditional character sets. Plain text files are also seen with these characters, though they have become far less common since Windows GUI text editors (using the [[Windows ANSI code page]]) have largely replaced DOS based ones.

===Shift_JIS===
[[File:Mona01.svg|thumb|{{nihongo|'''Monā'''|モナー|Monā}} Posted on {{nihongo|'''[[2ch]]'''|２ちゃんねる|Nichanneru}} in 2000]]
{{Main|Shift_JIS art}}
A large character selection and the availability of fixed-width characters allow Japanese users to use [[Shift JIS]] as a text-based art on Japanese websites.

===Unicode===
{{Main|Unicode}}
[[Unicode]] would seem to offer the ultimate flexibility in producing text based art with its huge variety of characters. However, finding a suitable fixed-width font is likely to be difficult if a significant subset of Unicode is desired. (Modern UNIX-style operating systems do provide complete fixed-width Unicode fonts, e.g. for [[xterm]]. Windows has the [[Courier New]] font which includes characters like ┌╥─╨┐♥☺♫Ƹ̵̡Ӝ̵̨̄Ʒ) Also, the common practice of rendering Unicode with a mixture of variable width fonts is likely to make predictable display hard if more than a tiny subset of Unicode is used.

===Overprinting (surprint)===
In the 1970s and early 1980s it was popular to produce a kind of text art that relied on overprinting &amp;mdash; the overall darkness of a particular character space dependent on how many characters, as well as the choice of character, printed in a particular place. Thanks to the increased granularity of tone, photographs were often converted to this type of printout. Even manual typewriters or [[daisy wheel printer]]s could be used. The technique has fallen from popularity since all cheap printers can easily print photographs, and a normal text file (or an e-mail message or Usenet posting) cannot represent overprinted text. However, something similar has emerged to replace it: shaded or colored ASCII art, using ANSI video terminal markup or color codes (such as those found in [[HTML]], [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]], and many internet [[message board]]s) to add a bit more tone variation. In this way, it is possible to create ASCII art where the characters only differ in color

{{American and British English differences|US flag first}}

'''American English''' (variously abbreviated '''AmE''', '''AE''', '''AmEng''', '''USEng''', '''en-US''',&lt;ref&gt;&lt;code&gt;en-US&lt;/code&gt; is the [[language code]] for ''U.S. American English'' , as defined by [[ISO standard]]s (see [[ISO 639-1]] and [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]]) and [[Internet standard]]s (see [[IETF language tag]]).&lt;/ref&gt; also known as '''United States English''', or '''U.S. English''') is a set of [[dialect]]s of the [[English language]] used mostly in the [[United States]]. Approximately two-thirds of [[first language|native speakers]] of English live in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Crystal|first=David|authorlink=David Crystal|year=1997|title=English as a Global Language|location=Cambridge|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-53032-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

English is the most common language in the United States. Though the U.S. [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] has no official language, English is the common language used by the federal government and is considered the [[de facto]] language of the United States because of its widespread use. English has been given official status by 28 of the 50 state governments.

The use of English in the United States was a result of [[British colonization of the Americas|British colonization]]. The first wave of English-speaking settlers arrived in North America in the 17th century. Since then, American English has been influenced by the languages of the [[Native American]] population, the languages of European and non-European colonists, immigrants and neighbors, and the languages of slaves from [[West Africa]].

==Phonology==
{{See also|North American English regional phonology}}
{{Ref improve section|date=June 2009}}
Compared to [[English language in England|English as spoken in England]]&lt;!--Do not change this to &quot;British English&quot;; they mean different things. &quot;English English&quot; is the correct term for English as spoken in England, while &quot;British English&quot; includes at least Scottish English and Welsh English too--&gt;, North American English&lt;ref&gt;''[[North American English]]'' (Trudgill, p. 2) is a collective term used for the varieties of the English language that are spoken in the United States and Canada.&lt;/ref&gt; is more homogeneous. Some distinctive accents can be found on the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] (for example, in eastern New England and New York City), partly because these areas were in close contact with England and imitated prestigious varieties of British English at a time when these were undergoing changes.&lt;ref&gt;Trudgill, pp. 46–47.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Request quotation|date=January 2010}} In addition, many speech communities on the East Coast have existed in their present locations for centuries, while the interior of the country was settled by people from all regions of the existing United States and developed a far more generic linguistic pattern.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

[[Image:Non rhotic-whites-usa.png|thumb|left|The red areas are those where non-rhotic pronunciations are found among some white people in the [[United States]]. [[African American Vernacular English|AAVE]]-influenced non-rhotic pronunciations may be found among [[black people]] throughout the country.&lt;ref&gt;Labov, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Most North American speech is [[Rhotic and non-rhotic accents|rhotic]], as English was in most places in the 17th century. Rhoticity was further supported by [[Hiberno-English]], [[West Country English]] and [[Scottish English]] as well as the fact most regions of England at this time also had rhotic accents.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jstor.org/pss/25484343&lt;/ref&gt; In most varieties of North American English, the sound corresponding to the letter ''r'' is a [[retroflex approximant|retroflex]] {{IPA|[ɻ]}} or [[alveolar approximant]] {{IPA|[ɹ]}} rather than a trill or a tap. The loss of syllable-final ''r'' in North America is confined mostly to the accents of [[Boston accent|eastern New England]], [[New York-New Jersey English|New York City]] and surrounding areas and the coastal portions of the [[Southern American English|South]], and [[African American Vernacular English]]. In rural [[tidewater Virginia]] and eastern [[New England]], 'r' is non-rhotic in accented (such as &quot;bird&quot;, &quot;work&quot;, &quot;first&quot;, &quot;birthday&quot;) as well as unaccented syllables, although this is declining among the younger generation of speakers.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Dropping of syllable-final ''r'' sometimes happens in natively rhotic dialects if ''r'' is located in unaccented syllables or words and the next syllable or word begins in a consonant. In England, the lost ''r'' was often changed into {{IPA|[ə]}} ([[schwa]]), giving rise to a new class of falling [[diphthong]]s. {{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}Furthermore, the ''er'' sound of ''f'''ur''''' or ''butt'''er''''', is realized in AmE as a [[monophthong]]al [[r-colored vowel]] (stressed {{IPA|[ɝ]}} or unstressed {{IPA|[ɚ]}} as represented in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]).{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} This does not happen in the non-rhotic varieties of North American speech.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

Some other English changes in which most North American dialects do not participate:
* The shift of {{IPA|/æ/}} to {{IPA|/ɑ/}} (the so-called &quot;[[broad A]]&quot;) before {{IPA|/f/, /s/, /θ/, /ð/, /z/, /v/}} alone or preceded by a [[homorganic]] nasal. This is the difference between the British [[Received Pronunciation]] and American pronunciation of ''bath'' and ''dance''.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} In the United States, only eastern New England speakers took up this modification, although even there it is becoming increasingly rare.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}
* The realization of intervocalic {{IPA|/t/}} as a glottal stop {{IPA|[ʔ]}} (as in {{IPA|[bɒʔəl]}} for ''bottle''). This change is not universal for British English and is not considered a feature of [[Received Pronunciation]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} This is not a property of most North American dialects. [[Newfoundland English]] is a notable exception.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

On the other hand, North American English has undergone some sound changes not found in other varieties of English speech:{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}
* The [[Phonological history of the low back vowels#Father-bother merger|merger of {{IPA|/ɑ/}} and {{IPA|/ɒ/}}]], making ''father'' and ''bother'' rhyme. {{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}This change is nearly universal in North American English, occurring almost everywhere except for parts of eastern New England, hence the [[Boston accent]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}
* The merger of {{IPA|/ɑ/}} and {{IPA|/ɔ/}}.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} This is the so-called [[cot–caught merger]], where ''cot'' and ''caught'' are [[homophone]]s. This change has occurred in eastern New England, in [[Pittsburgh English|Pittsburgh]] and surrounding areas, and from the [[Great Plains]] westward.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

* For speakers who do not merge ''caught'' and ''cot'': The replacement of the ''cot'' vowel with the ''caught'' vowel before [[voiceless fricative]]s (as in ''cloth, off'' [which is found in some old-fashioned varieties of RP]), as well as before {{IPA|/ŋ/}} (as in ''strong, long),'' usually in ''gone,'' often in ''on,'' and irregularly before {{IPA|/ɡ/}} ''(log, hog, dog, fog'' [which is not found in British English at all]).
* The replacement of the ''lot'' vowel with the ''strut'' vowel in most utterances of the words ''was, of, from, what'' and in many utterances of the words ''everybody, nobody, somebody, anybody;'' the word ''because'' has either {{IPA|/ʌ/}} or {{IPA|/ɔ/}};&lt;ref&gt;According to ''Merriam-Webster Collegiate Dictionary, Eleventh Edition''. For speakers who merge ''caught'' and ''cot'', {{IPA|/ɔ/}} is to be understood as the vowel they have in both ''caught'' and ''cot''.&lt;/ref&gt; ''want'' has normally {{IPA|/ɔ/}} or {{IPA|/ɑ/}}, sometimes {{IPA|/ʌ/}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infoplease.com/ipd/A0731165.html], [http://www.bartleby.com/61/55/W0025500.html], [http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/want]&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[English-language vowel changes before historic r|Vowel merger]] before intervocalic {{IPA|/ɹ/}}. Which vowels are affected varies between dialects, but the [[English-language_vowel_changes_before_historic_r#Mary-marry-merry_merger|Mary-marry-merry]], [[English-language_vowel_changes_before_historic_r#Mirror-nearer_merger|nearer-mirror]], and [[English-language_vowel_changes_before_historic_r#Hurry-furry_merger|hurry-furry]] mergers are all widespread. Another such change is the laxing of {{IPA|/e/}}, {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/u/}} to {{IPA|/ɛ/}}, {{IPA|/ɪ/}} and {{IPA|/ʊ/}} before {{IPA|/ɹ/}}, causing pronunciations like {{IPA|[pɛɹ]}}, {{IPA|[pɪɹ]}} and {{IPA|[pjʊɹ]}} for ''pair, peer'' and ''pure''. The resulting sound {{IPA|[ʊɹ]}} is often further reduced to {{IPA|[ɝ]}}, especially after [[palatal consonant|palatals]], so that ''cure, pure, mature'' and ''sure'' rhyme with ''fir.''
* [[English consonant cluster reductions#Yod-dropping|Dropping of {{IPA|/j/}}]] is more extensive than in RP. In most North American accents, {{IPA|/j/}} is dropped after all [[alveolar consonant|alveolar]] and interdental consonant, so that ''new, duke, Tuesday, resume'' are pronounced {{IPA|/nu/}}, {{IPA|/duk/}}, {{IPA|/tuzdeɪ/}}, {{IPA|/ɹɪzum/}}.
* [[Phonological history of English short A#æ-tensing|æ-tensing]] in environments that vary widely from accent to accent; for example, for many speakers, {{IPA|/æ/}} is approximately realized as {{IPA|[eə]}} before [[nasal consonant]]s. In some accents, particularly those from [[Baltimore]], [[Philadelphia]], and [[New York City]], {{IPA|[æ]}} and {{IPA|[eə]}} contrast sometimes, as in ''Yes, I '''can''''' {{IPA|[kæn]}} vs. ''tin '''can''''' {{IPA|[keən]}}.
* The [[flapping]] of intervocalic {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/d/}} to [[alveolar tap]] {{IPA|[ɾ]}} before unstressed vowels (as in ''bu'''tt'''er'', ''par'''t'''y'') and syllabic {{IPA|/l/}} (''bo'''tt'''le''), as well as at the end of a word or morpheme before any vowel (''wha'''t''' else'', ''wha'''t'''ever''). Thus, for most speakers, pairs such as ''ladder/latter, metal/medal,'' and ''coating/coding'' are pronounced the same. For many speakers, this merger is incomplete and does not occur after {{IPA|/aɪ/}}; these speakers tend to pronounce ''writer'' with {{IPA|[əɪ]}} and ''rider'' with {{IPA|[aɪ]}}. This is a form of [[Canadian raising]] but, unlike more extreme forms of that process, does not affect {{IPA|/aʊ/}}. In some areas and idiolects, a phonemic distinction between what elsewhere become homophones through this process is maintained by vowel lengthening in the vowel preceding the formerly voiced consonant, ''e.g.'', [læ:·ɾɹ̩] for &quot;ladder&quot; as opposed to [læ·ɾɹ̩] for &quot;latter&quot;.
*[[T-glottalization]] is common when /t/ is in the final position of a syllable or word (''get'', ''fretful'': [ɡɛʔ], [ˈfɹɛʔfəl]), though this is always superseded by the aforementioned rules of flapping
* Both intervocalic {{IPA|/nt/}} and {{IPA|/n/}} may be realized as {{IPA|[n]}} or {{IPA|[ɾ̃]}}, making ''winter'' and ''winner'' homophones. Most areas in which /nt/ is reduced to /n/, it is accompanied further by nasalization of simple post-vocalic /n/, so that V/nt/ and V/n/ remain phonemically distinct. In such cases, the preceding vowel becomes nasalized, and is followed in cases where the former /nt/ was present, by a distinct /n/. This stop-absorption by the preceding nasal /n/ does not occur when the second syllable is stressed, as in ''entail''.
* The [[Phonological history of the high front vowels#Pin-pen merger|pin-pen merger]], by which {{IPA|[ɛ]}} is raised to {{IPA|[ɪ]}} before nasal consonants, making pairs like ''pen/pin'' homophonous. This merger originated in [[Southern American English]] but is now also sometimes found in parts of the Midwest and West as well, especially in people with roots in the mountainous areas of the [[Southeastern United States]].

Some mergers found in most varieties of both American and British English include:{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}
* The [[English-language vowel changes before historic r#Horse-hoarse merger|merger]] of the vowels {{IPA|/ɔ/}} and {{IPA|/o/}} before 'r', making pairs like ''horse/hoarse, corps/core, for/four, morning/mourning,'' etc. [[homophones]].
* The [[wine–whine merger]] making pairs like ''wine/whine, wet/whet, Wales/whales, wear/where,'' etc. [[homophone]]s, in most cases eliminating {{IPA|/ʍ/}}, the [[voiceless labiovelar fricative]]. Many older varieties of southern and western American English still keep these distinct, but the merger appears to be spreading.

==Vocabulary==
North America has given the English [[lexicon]] many thousands of words, meanings, and phrases. Several thousand are now used in English as spoken internationally.

===Creation of an American lexicon===
{{Refimprove|subsection|date=June 2009}}
The process of coining new lexical items started as soon as the colonists began borrowing names for unfamiliar flora, fauna, and topography from the [[Native American languages]].&lt;ref&gt;http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=ltoDXfkzZGsC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=moose+etymology&amp;ots=sSxd8GVMPH&amp;sig=8iFiF5oNiF2E0U5LHoZUUF1dHHU#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=falseM&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of such names are ''[[opossum]], [[raccoon]], [[squash (fruit)|squash]]'' and ''[[moose]]'' (from [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]]).&lt;ref&gt;http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=ltoDXfkzZGsC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=moose+etymology&amp;ots=sSxd8GVMPH&amp;sig=8iFiF5oNiF2E0U5LHoZUUF1dHHU#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; Other Native American loanwords, such as ''[[wigwam]]'' or ''[[moccasin]]'', describe articles in common use among Native Americans. The languages of the other colonizing nations also added to the American vocabulary; for instance, ''[[cookie]], [[cruller]]'', [[Urban stoop|stoop]], and ''pit'' (of a fruit) from [[Dutch Language|Dutch]]; ''[[levee]], portage'' (&quot;carrying of boats or goods&quot;) and (probably) ''[[gopher (animal)|gopher]]'' from [[French language|French]]; ''[[barbecue]], [[stevedore]], and [[rodeo]]'' from [[Spanish language|Spanish]].&lt;ref&gt;http://repository.upenn.edu/dissertations/AAI9308630/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=ROmDu-bYMRYC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=rodeo+etymology&amp;ots=Q8MWUXWWeS&amp;sig=1mCnpypy9pF4E4WoGV_gSVXElGk#v=onepage&amp;q=rodeo&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=p1krAAAAYAAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA9&amp;dq=gaufre+gopher&amp;ots=00ds4J1VBe&amp;sig=DF3qa0vDjd2mxhMb0IW1Nmu_OB0#v=onepage&amp;q=gaufre%20&amp;f=false GOPHER&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=osQAtpUtDvkC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR7&amp;dq=dutch+words+american+english&amp;ots=sMZL8QrNdq&amp;sig=SM1AA9RcONfDv1AwJ1DXDqkmf8U#v=onepage&amp;q=stoop&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the earliest and most notable regular &quot;English&quot; additions to the American vocabulary, dating from the early days of colonization through the early 19th century, are terms describing the features of the North American landscape; for instance, ''run, branch, fork, [[snag]], [[hill|bluff]], [[gulch]], neck'' (of the woods), ''barrens, [[bottomland]], notch, knob, riffle, [[rapid]]s, watergap, cutoff, [[trail]], [[tree line|timberline]]'' and ''[[water divide|divide]]''{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}. Already existing words such as ''[[stream|creek]], [[swamp|slough]], [[Ice pellets|sleet]]'' and (in later use) ''[[Drainage basin|watershed]]'' received new meanings that were unknown in England.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

Other noteworthy American toponyms are found among loanwords; for example, ''[[prairie]], [[butte]]'' (French); ''[[bayou]]'' ([[Choctaw]] via Louisiana French); ''[[coulee]]'' (Canadian French, but used also in Louisiana with a different meaning); ''[[canyon]], [[mesa]], [[arroyo (creek)|arroyo]]'' (Spanish); ''vlei, [[kill (body of water)|kill]]'' (Dutch, [[Hudson Valley]]).

The word ''[[wikt:corn|corn]]'', used in England to refer to wheat (or any cereal), came to denote the plant ''[[Zea mays]]'', the most important crop in the U.S., originally named ''[[Indian corn]]'' by the earliest settlers; wheat, rye, barley, oats, etc. came to be collectively referred to as ''[[grain]]'' (or ''breadstuffs''). Other notable farm related vocabulary additions were the new meanings assumed by ''[[barn]]'' (not only a building for hay and grain storage, but also for housing livestock) and ''team'' (not just the horses, but also the vehicle along with them), as well as, in various periods, the terms ''[[rangeland|range]], [[corn crib|(corn) crib]], [[truck farm|truck]], [[grain elevator|elevator]], [[sharecropping]]'' and ''[[feedlot]].''{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

''[[Ranch]],'' later applied to a [[ranch house|house style]], derives from [[Mexican Spanish]]; most Spanish contributions came after the [[War of 1812]], with the opening of the West. Among these are, other than toponyms, ''[[chaps]]'' (from ''chaparreras), [[plaza]], [[lasso]], [[bronco]], [[Wikt:buckaroo|buckaroo]], [[rodeo]];'' examples of &quot;English&quot; additions from the [[cowboy]] era are ''bad man, maverick, chuck'' (&quot;food&quot;) and ''[[Boot Hill]];'' from the [[California Gold Rush]] came such idioms as ''hit pay dirt'' or ''strike it rich.'' The word ''blizzard'' probably originated in the West. A couple of notable late 18th century additions are the verb ''belittle'' and the noun ''bid,'' both first used in writing by [[Thomas Jefferson]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

With the new continent developed new forms of dwelling, and hence a large inventory of words designating real estate concepts ''(land office, [[Land lot|lot]], outlands, waterfront,'' the verbs ''locate'' and ''relocate, betterment, addition, subdivision),'' types of property ''([[log cabin]], [[adobe]])'' in the 18th century; ''[[frame house]], [[apartment]], tenement house, [[shack]], [[Wikt:shanty|shanty]]'' in the 19th century; ''project, [[condominium]], [[townhouse]], [[split-level home|split-level]], [[mobile home]], multi-family'' in the 20th century), and parts thereof ''([[driveway]], breezeway, [[backyard]], dooryard; [[Clapboard (architecture)|clapboard]], [[siding]], trim, [[baseboard]]; stoop'' (from Dutch), ''family room, den;'' and, in recent years, ''[[HVAC]], [[central air]], walkout basement).''{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

Ever since the [[American Revolution]], a great number of terms connected with the U.S. political institutions have entered the language; examples are ''run, gubernatorial, [[primary election]], [[carpetbagger]]'' (after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]), ''repeater, [[lame duck (politics)|lame duck]]'' and ''[[pork barrel]].'' Some of these are internationally used (for example, ''[[caucus]], [[gerrymander]], [[filibuster]], [[exit poll]]).''{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

The rise of capitalism, the development of industry and material innovations throughout the 19th and 20th centuries were the source of a massive stock of distinctive new words, phrases and idioms. Typical examples are the vocabulary of ''[[railroad]]ing'' (see further at [[rail terminology]]) and ''[[transport]]ation'' terminology, ranging from names of roads (from ''dirt roads'' and ''back roads'' to ''[[freeway]]s'' and ''[[parkway]]s)'' to road infrastructure ''([[parking lot]], [[overpass]], [[rest area]]),'' and from automotive terminology to ''[[public transit]]'' (for example, in the sentence &quot;''riding'' the ''subway downtown''&quot;); such American introductions as ''commuter'' (from ''commutation ticket), [[concourse]], to board'' (a vehicle), ''to park, double-park'' and ''parallel park'' (a car), ''[[Wikt:double decker|double decker]]'' or the noun ''terminal'' have long been used in all dialects of English.&lt;ref&gt;A few of these are now chiefly found, or have been more productive, outside of the U.S.; for example, ''jump,'' &quot;to drive past a traffic signal;&quot; ''block'' meaning &quot;building,&quot; and ''center,'' &quot;central point in a town&quot; or &quot;main area for a particular activity&quot; (cf. Oxford English Dictionary).&lt;/ref&gt; Trades of various kinds have endowed (American) English with household words describing jobs and occupations ''([[bartender]], longshoreman, patrolman, [[hobo]], [[bouncer (doorman)|bouncer]], bellhop, [[roustabout]], [[White-collar worker|white collar]], [[blue collar]], [[employee]], boss'' [from Dutch], ''[[intern]], [[busboy]], [[mortician]], [[senior citizen]]),'' businesses and workplaces ''([[department store]], [[supermarket]], [[thrift store]], [[gift shop]], [[Pharmacy|drugstore]], [[motel]], [[main street]], [[gas station]], [[hardware store]], [[savings and loan]], hock'' [also from Dutch]), as well as general concepts and innovations ''([[automated teller machine]], [[smart card]], [[cash register]], [[dishwasher]], reservation'' [as at hotels], ''pay envelope, [[movie]], mileage, [[shortage]], [[power outage|outage]], [[blood bank]]).''{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

Already existing English words&amp;nbsp;—such as ''[[General store|store]], [[Retailing|shop]], dry goods, [[haberdashery]], [[lumber]]''— underwent shifts in meaning; some&amp;nbsp;—such as ''[[wiktionary:Mason|mason]], student, [[clerk (position)|clerk]]'', the verbs ''can'' (as in &quot;canned goods&quot;), ''ship, fix, carry, enroll'' (as in school), ''run'' (as in &quot;run a business&quot;), ''release'' and ''haul''— were given new significations, while others (such as ''[[tradesman]])'' have retained meanings that disappeared in England.

A number of Americanisms describing material innovations remained largely confined to North America: ''[[elevator]], [[ground (electricity)|ground]], [[gasoline]];'' many automotive terms fall in this category, although many do not ''([[hatchback]], [[SUV]], [[station wagon]], [[tailgate]], [[motorhome]], [[truck]], [[pickup truck]], to exhaust).''{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

In addition to the above-mentioned loans from French, Spanish, Mexican Spanish, Dutch, and Native American languages, other accretions from foreign languages came with 19th and early 20th century immigration; notably, from [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] ''([[chutzpah]], schmooze, tush'' and [[German language|German]]&amp;nbsp;—''[[hamburger]]'' and culinary terms like ''frankfurter/franks, liverwurst, sauerkraut, [[Hot dog|wiener]], [[delicatessen|deli(catessen)]]; [[scram]], [[kindergarten]], [[gesundheit]];''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.randomhouse.com/wotd/index.pperl?date=19970923 The Maven's Word of the Day], [[Random House]].

Finally, a large number of English colloquialisms from various periods are American in origin; some have lost their American flavor (from ''[[Okay|OK]]'' and ''cool'' to ''[[nerd]]'' and ''[[24/7]]),'' while others have not ''([[have a nice day]], sure);''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oup.com/oald-bin/web_getald7index1a.pl?nav=on&amp;which_entry=009421%23x1%23x1%23day&amp;selected_word=day&amp;search_word=day], [http://www.oup.com/oald-bin/web_getald7index1a.pl?nav=on&amp;which_entry=036903%23x1%23x1%23sure&amp;selected_word=sure&amp;search_word=sure#sure_adv] Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary.

===Morphology===
American English has always shown a marked tendency [[functional shift|to use nouns as verbs]].&lt;ref name = &quot;iqiyyl&quot;&gt;Trudgill, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of verbed nouns are ''interview, advocate, vacuum, lobby, pressure, rear-end, transition, feature, profile, belly-ache, spearhead, skyrocket, showcase, service'' (as a car), ''corner, torch, exit'' (as in &quot;exit the lobby&quot;), ''factor'' (in mathematics), ''gun'' (&quot;shoot&quot;), ''author'' (which disappeared in English around 1630 and was revived in the U.S. three centuries later) and, out of American material, ''proposition, graft'' (bribery), ''bad-mouth, [[vacation]], major, [[backpack]], [[backtracking|backtrack]], intern, ticket'' (traffic violations), ''hassle, [[asphalt concrete|blacktop]], peer-review, dope'' and ''[[Drug overdose|OD]]'', and, of course ''verbed'' as used at the start of this sentence. The saying goes, 'In the US of A there is no such thing as a noun that can't be &quot;verbed&quot;'.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

[[Compound (linguistics)|Compound]]s coined in the U.S. are for instance ''[[foothill]], [[flatlands]], [[badlands]], [[landslide]]'' (in all senses), ''[[Summary|overview]]'' (the noun), ''[[Wikt:backdrop|backdrop]], [[teenager]], [[brainstorming|brainstorm]], [[Wikt:bandwagon|bandwagon]], [[hitchhike]], smalltime, [[Wikt:deadbeat|deadbeat]], [[frontman]], lowbrow'' and ''highbrow, hell-bent, foolproof, nitpick, about-face'' (later verbed), ''upfront'' (in all senses), ''fixer-upper, no-show;'' many of these are phrases used as adverbs or (often) hyphenated attributive adjectives: ''[[non-profit]], [[for-profit]], free-for-all, ready-to-wear, catchall, low-down, down-and-out, down and dirty, in-your-face, nip and tuck;'' many compound nouns and adjectives are open: ''[[happy hour]], [[fall guy]], [[capital gain]], [[road trip]], wheat pit, head start, [[plea bargain]];'' some of these are colorful ''([[empty nester]], [[loan shark]], [[Wikt:ambulance chaser|ambulance chaser]], [[buzz saw]], [[ghetto blaster]], dust bunny),'' others are euphemistic ''([[differently abled]], [[human resources]], physically challenged, [[affirmative action]], [[correctional facility]]).''

Many compound nouns have the form verb plus preposition: ''[[Wikt:add-on|add-on]], stopover, lineup, [[Wikt:shakedown|shakedown]], tryout, spin-off, [[rundown]]'' (&quot;summary&quot;), ''[[shootout]], [[holdup]], hideout, comeback, cookout, [[Bribery|kickback]], [[makeover]], [[takeover]], rollback'' (&quot;decrease&quot;), ''rip-off, come-on, shoo-in, fix-up, tie-in, tie-up'' (&quot;stoppage&quot;), ''stand-in.'' These essentially are nouned [[phrasal verb]]s; some prepositional and phrasal verbs are in fact of American origin ''(spell out, figure out, hold up, brace up, size up, rope in, back up/off/down/out, step down, miss out on, kick around, cash in, rain out, check in'' and ''check out'' (in all senses), ''fill in'' (&quot;inform&quot;), ''kick in'' (&quot;contribute&quot;), ''square off, sock in, sock away, factor in/out, come down with, give up on, lay off'' (from employment), ''run into'' and ''across'' (&quot;meet&quot;), ''stop by, pass up, put up'' (money), ''set up'' (&quot;frame&quot;), ''trade in, pick up on, pick up after, lose out.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50232893?] [http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50084582/50084582se12?single=1&amp;query_type=word&amp;queryword=figure+out&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10&amp;hilite=50084582se12] [http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50107109/50107109se53?query_type=word&amp;queryword=hold+up&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10&amp;sort_type=alpha&amp;result_place=1&amp;search_id=f2Cb-qlNYMH-4067&amp;hilite=50107109se53] [http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50225951/50225951se1?single=1&amp;query_type=word&amp;queryword=size+up&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10&amp;hilite=50225951se1] [http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50208750?] [http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50016263/50016263se19?query_type=word&amp;queryword=back+up&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10&amp;sort_type=alpha&amp;result_place=1&amp;search_id=f2Cb-8eN1ib-4115&amp;hilite=50016263se19] [http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50237099/50237099se24?query_type=word&amp;queryword=step+down&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10&amp;sort_type=alpha&amp;result_place=2&amp;search_id=f2Cb-GnUl9A-4127&amp;hilite=50237099se24] [http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/00311905?query_type=word&amp;queryword=miss&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10&amp;sort_type=alpha&amp;result_place=6&amp;search_id=f2Cb-GT1q2L-4137&amp;hilite=00311905] [http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50126465?] [http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50196574?query_type=word&amp;queryword=rain+out&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10&amp;single=1&amp;sort_type=alpha] [http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50034059/50034059se1?query_type=word&amp;queryword=cash+in&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10&amp;sort_type=alpha&amp;result_place=1&amp;search_id=f2Cb-smXBXz-4166&amp;hilite=50034059se1] [http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50081535?query_type=word&amp;queryword=factor&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10&amp;sort_type=alpha&amp;result_place=3&amp;search_id=f2Cb-KGfO1T-4176&amp;hilite=50081535] [http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50084734/50084734se18?query_type=word&amp;queryword=fill+in&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10&amp;sort_type=alpha&amp;result_place=2&amp;search_id=f2Cb-USt2E6-4186&amp;hilite=50084734se18]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;British author [[George Orwell]] (in ''English People'', 1947, cited in OED s.v. ''lose)'' criticized an alleged &quot;American tendency&quot; to &quot;burden every verb with a preposition that adds nothing to its meaning (''win out'', ''lose out'', ''face up to'', etc.)&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Noun endings such as ''-ee (retiree), -ery (bakery), -ster (gangster)'' and ''-cian (beautician)'' are also particularly productive.&lt;ref name = &quot;iqiyyl&quot;/&gt; Some verbs ending in ''-ize'' are of U.S. origin; for example, ''fetishize, prioritize, burglarize, accessorize, itemize, editorialize, customize, notarize, [[weatherization|weatherize]], winterize, [[Miranda v. Arizona|Mirandize]];'' and so are some [[back-formation]]s ''(locate, fine-tune, evolute, curate, donate, emote, upholster, peeve'' and ''enthuse).'' Among syntactical constructions that arose in the U.S. are ''as of'' (with dates and times), ''outside of, headed for, meet up with, back of, convince someone to..., not to be about to'' and ''lack for.''

Americanisms formed by alteration of existing words include notably ''pesky, phony, rambunctious, pry'' (as in &quot;pry open,&quot; from ''prize), putter'' (verb), ''buddy, [[sundae]], skeeter, sashay'' and ''kitty-corner.'' Adjectives that arose in the U.S. are for example, ''lengthy, bossy, [[cute]]'' and ''cutesy, grounded'' (of a child), ''punk'' (in all senses), ''sticky'' (of the weather), ''through'' (as in &quot;through train,&quot; or meaning &quot;finished&quot;), and many colloquial forms such as ''peppy'' or ''wacky''. American [[blend]]s include ''[[motel]], guesstimate, [[infomercial]]'' and ''[[televangelist]].''

===English words that survived in the United States and not Britain===
A number of words and meanings that originated in [[Middle English]] or [[Early Modern English]] and that always have been in everyday use in the United States dropped out in most varieties of British English; some of these have cognates in [[Scottish Lowlands|Lowland Scots]]. Terms such as ''[[autumn|fall]]'' (&quot;autumn&quot;), ''[[faucet]]'', ''[[diaper]]'', ''[[candy]]'', ''[[Frying pan|skillet]]'', ''[[eyeglasses]]'', and ''obligate,'' are often regarded as Americanisms. ''Fall'' for example came to denote the season in 16th century England, a contraction of Middle English expressions like &quot;fall of the leaf&quot; and &quot;fall of the year&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|fall}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 17th century, [[British colonization of the Americas|English immigration to the British colonies]] in North America was at its peak and the new settlers took the English language with them. While the term ''fall'' gradually became obsolete in Britain, it became the more common term in North America. ''Gotten'' ([[past participle]] of ''get'') is often considered to be an Americanism, although there are some areas of Britain, such as Lancashire and North-eastern England, that still continue to use it and sometimes also use ''putten'' as the past participle for ''put'' (which is not done by most speakers of American English).&lt;ref&gt;''A Handbook of Varieties of English'',Bernd Kortmann &amp; Edgar W. Schneider, Walter de Gruyter, 2004, page 115&lt;/ref&gt;

Other words and meanings, to various extents, were brought back to Britain, especially in the second half of the 20th century; these include ''hire'' (&quot;to employ&quot;), ''quit'' (&quot;to stop,&quot; which spawned ''quitter'' in the U.S.), ''I guess'' (famously criticized by [[H. W. Fowler]]), ''[[baggage]]'', ''hit'' (a place), and the adverbs ''overly'' and ''presently'' (&quot;currently&quot;). Some of these, for example ''[[monkey wrench]]'' and ''[[wastebasket]]'', originated in 19th-century Britain.

The mandative [[subjunctive mood|subjunctive]] (as in &quot;the City Attorney suggested that the case ''not be closed''&quot;) is livelier in American English than it is in British English. It appears in some areas as a spoken usage and is considered obligatory in contexts that are more formal. The adjectives ''mad'' meaning &quot;angry&quot;, ''smart'' meaning &quot;intelligent&quot;, and ''sick'' meaning &quot;ill&quot; are also more frequent in American (these meanings are also frequent in Hiberno-English) than British English.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary.

==Regional differences==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Huckleberry Hound]] --&gt;
{{Main|Regional vocabularies of American English|North American English regional phonology}}

While written AmE is standardized across the country, there are several recognizable variations in the spoken language, both in pronunciation and in vernacular vocabulary. ''[[General American]]'' is the name given to any American accent that is relatively free of noticeable regional influences.

After the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], the settlement of the western territories by migrants from the Eastern U.S. led to dialect mixing and leveling, so that regional dialects are most strongly differentiated along the [[East]]ern [[Coast|seaboard]]. The [[Connecticut River]] and [[Long Island Sound]] is usually regarded as the southern/western extent of New England speech, which has its roots in the speech of the Puritans from [[East Anglia]] who settled in the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]]. The [[Potomac River]] generally divides a group of Northern coastal dialects from the beginning of the Coastal Southern dialect area; in between these two rivers several local variations exist, chief among them the one that prevails in and around [[New York City]] and northern [[New Jersey]], which developed on a Dutch [[substratum]] after the English conquered New Amsterdam. The main features of Coastal Southern speech can be traced to the speech of the English from the [[West Country]] who settled in Virginia after leaving England at the time of the [[English Civil War]].

Although no longer region-specific,&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Trudgill, p.42.&lt;/ref&gt; [[African American Vernacular English]], which remains prevalent among [[African American]]s, has a close relationship to Southern varieties of AmE and has greatly influenced everyday speech of many Americans.

A distinctive speech pattern also appears near the border between [[Canada]] and the United States, centered on the [[Great Lakes]] region (but only on the American side). This is the [[Inland Northern American English|Inland North Dialect]]—the &quot;standard Midwestern&quot; speech that was the basis for General American in the mid-20th century (although it has been recently modified by the [[northern cities vowel shift]]). Those not from this area frequently confuse it with the North Midland dialect treated below, referring to both collectively as &quot;Midwestern&quot; in the mid-Atlantic region or &quot;Northern&quot; in the Southern US. The so-called '&quot;[[North Central American English|Minnesotan]]&quot; dialect is also prevalent in the cultural [[Upper Midwest]], and is characterized by influences from the German and Scandinavian settlers of the region (yah for yes/ja in German, pronounced the same way).

In the interior, the situation is very different. West of the [[Appalachian Mountains]] begins the broad zone of what is generally called &quot;[[Midland American English|Midland]]&quot; speech. This is divided into two discrete subdivisions, the North Midland that begins north of the [[Ohio River]] valley area, and the South Midland speech; sometimes the former is designated simply &quot;Midland&quot; and the latter is reckoned as &quot;Highland Southern&quot;. The North Midland speech continues to expand westward until it becomes the closely related Western dialect which contains [[Pacific Northwest English]] as well as the well-known [[California English]], although in the immediate [[San Francisco]] area some older speakers do not possess the [[cot–caught merger]] and thus retain the distinction between words such as cot and caught which reflects a historical Mid-Atlantic heritage.

The South Midland or Highland Southern dialect follows the [[Ohio River]] in a generally southwesterly direction, moves across [[Arkansas]] and [[Oklahoma]] west of the [[Mississippi river|Mississippi]], and peters out in [[West Texas]]. It is a version of the Midland speech that has assimilated some coastal Southern forms (outsiders often mistakenly believe South Midland speech and coastal South speech to be the same).

The island state of Hawaii has a distinctive [[Hawaiian Pidgin]].

Finally, dialect development in the United States has been notably influenced by the distinctive speech of such important cultural centers as [[Baltimore]], [[Boston]], [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]], [[Chicago]], [[Detroit]], [[New Orleans]], [[New York City]], [[Philadelphia]] and [[Pittsburgh]],   which imposed their marks on the surrounding areas.

==Differences between British English and American English==
{{Main|American and British English differences}}
American English and [[British English]] (BrE) differ at the levels of phonology, phonetics, vocabulary, and, to a lesser extent, grammar and orthography.
The first large American dictionary, ''[[Webster's dictionary|An American Dictionary of the English Language]]'', was written by [[Noah Webster]] in 1828; Webster intended to show that the United States, which was a relatively new country at the time, spoke a different dialect from that of Britain.

Differences in grammar are relatively minor, and normally do not affect mutual intelligibility; these include: different use of some [[verbal auxiliaries]]; formal (rather than notional) agreement with [[collective noun]]s; different preferences for the past forms of a few verbs (for example, AmE/BrE: ''learned''/''learnt'', ''burned''/''burnt'', and in ''sneak'', ''dive'', ''get''); different prepositions and adverbs in certain contexts (for example, AmE ''in school,'' BrE ''at school''&lt;!--when it means &quot;to be a student&quot;--&gt;); and whether or not a definite article is used, in very few cases (AmE ''to the hospital'', BrE ''to hospital''; contrast, however, AmE ''actress Elizabeth Taylor'', BrE ''the actress Elizabeth Taylor''). Often, these differences are a matter of relative preferences rather than absolute rules; and most are not stable, since the two varieties are constantly influencing each other.&lt;ref&gt;Algeo, John (2006). ''British or American English?''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. ISBN 0-521-37993-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Differences in [[orthography]] are also trivial. Some of the forms that now serve to distinguish American from British spelling (''color'' for ''colour'', ''center'' for ''centre'', ''traveler'' for ''traveller'', etc.) were introduced by Noah Webster himself; others are due to spelling tendencies in Britain from the 17th century until the present day (for example, ''-ise'' for ''-ize'', although the Oxford English Dictionary still prefers the ''-ize'' ending) and cases favored by the [[francophile]] tastes of 19th century [[Victorian England]], which had little effect on AmE (for example, ''programme'' for ''program'', ''manoeuvre'' for ''maneuver'', ''skilful'' for ''skillful'', ''cheque'' for ''check'', etc.).&lt;ref&gt;Peters, Pam (2004). ''The Cambridge Guide to English Usage''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. ISBN 0-521-62181-X, pp. 34 and 511.&lt;/ref&gt;

AmE sometimes favors words that are [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphologically]] more complex, whereas BrE uses clipped forms, such as AmE ''transportation'' and BrE ''transport'' or where the British form is a [[back-formation]], such as AmE ''burglarize'' and BrE ''burgle'' (from ''burglar''). It should however be noted that while individuals usually use one or the other, both forms will be widely understood and mostly used alongside each other within the two systems.

'''Albert Goodwill Spalding''' ([[Byron, Illinois|Byron]], [[Illinois]] September 2, 1850 – September 9, 1915 in [[Point Loma, California|Point Loma]], [[San Diego]], [[California]]) was a professional [[baseball]] player, manager and co-founder of [[Spalding (sports equipment)|A.G. Spalding]] sporting goods company.

==Biography==
Having played baseball throughout his youth, Spalding first played competitively with the [[Rockford, Illinois|Rockford]] Pioneers, a youth team, which he joined in 1865.  After pitching his team to a 26–2 victory over a local men's amateur team (the Mercantiles), he was approached by another, the Forest Citys, for whom he played for two years.  In the autumn of 1867 he accepted a $40 per week contract, nominally as a clerk, but really to play professionally for the [[Chicago]] Excelsiors, a not uncommon arrangement used to circumvent the rules of the time, which forbade the hiring of professional players.  Following the formation of baseball's first professional organization, the [[National Association of Professional Baseball Players]], which became known as the [[National Association of Professional Base Ball Players|National Association]], the Association, or NA, in 1871, Spalding joined the [[History of the Atlanta Braves#Boston years|Boston Red Stockings]] (precursor club to the modern [[Atlanta Braves]]) and was highly successful; winning 206 games (and losing only 53) as a pitcher and batting .323 as a hitter. 

[[William Hulbert]], principal owner of the [[Chicago Cubs|Chicago White Stockings]], did not like the loose organization of the National Association and the gambling element that influenced it, so he decided to create a new organization, which he dubbed the [[National League]] of Baseball Clubs. To aid him in this venture, Hulbert enlisted the help of Spalding. Playing to the pitcher's desire to return to his Midwestern roots and challenging Spalding's integrity, Hulbert convinced Spalding to sign a contract to play for the White Stockings (now known as the [[Chicago Cubs]]) in 1876. Spalding then coaxed teammates [[Deacon White]], [[Ross Barnes]] and [[Cal McVey]], as well as [[Philadelphia Athletics]] players [[Cap Anson]] and [[Bob Addy]], to sign with Chicago. This was all done under complete secrecy during the playing season because players were all free agents in those days and they did not want their current club and especially the fans to know they were leaving to play elsewhere the next year. News of the signings by the Boston and Philadelphia players leaked to the press before the season ended, and all of them suffered verbal abuse and physical threats from the kranks, as baseball fans were called at the time, in Beantown and the City of Brotherly Love.

In the following months, Hulbert and Spalding organized the National League by enlisting the four major teams in the East and the three other top teams in what was then considered to be the West. Joining Chicago initially were the leading teams from [[Cincinnati]], [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]], and [[Indianapolis]]. The owners of these western clubs accompanied Hulbert and Spalding to New York where they secretly met with owners from New York, Philadelphia, Hartford, and Boston. Each signed the league's constitution, and the National League was officially born.

Although the National Association held on for a few more seasons, it was no longer recognized as the premier organization for professional baseball. Gradually, it faded out of existence and was replaced by myriad minor leagues and associations around the country.

Meanwhile, Spalding and his brother began a sporting goods store in [[Chicago]].  In 1877, Spalding began to use a glove to protect his catching hand. People had used gloves previously, but never had a star like Spalding used one. Of course, Spalding had an ulterior motive for doing so. He and his brother sold baseball gloves, and wearing one himself was good for business.

In 1876, Spalding won 47 games as the prime pitchers for the Chicago White Stockings, who captured the National League's inaugural pennant by a wide margin.

Spalding published the first official rules guide for baseball. In it he stated that only Spalding balls could be used (previously, the quality of the balls used had been subpar). Spalding also founded the ''Baseball Guide'', which at the time was the most widely-read baseball publication.  Spalding retired from playing baseball in 1878, although he continued as a major force as owner of the White Stockings and major influence on the National League.  Spalding's .796 career winning percentage (from an era when teams played about once or twice a week) is the highest ever achieved by a baseball pitcher.

In 1888–1889, Spalding took a group of Major League players around the world to promote baseball and [[Spalding (sports equipment)|Spalding sporting goods]].  Playing across the western U.S., the tour made stops in Hawaii (although no game was played), New Zealand, Australia, [[Ceylon]], Egypt, Italy, France, and England.  The tour returned to grand receptions in New York, [[Philadelphia]], and Chicago.  The tour included future [[National Baseball Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]]rs [[Cap Anson|Adrian &quot;Cap&quot; Anson]] and [[John Montgomery Ward]].  While the players were on the tour, the National League instituted new rules regarding player pay that led to a revolt of players, led by Ward, who started the [[Players League|Players' League]] the following season (1890).  The league lasted one year, partially due to the anti-competitive tactics of Spalding to limit its success. 

Spalding's store grew rapidly over the next 25 years, with 14 stores by 1901, expanded from retail into manufacturing baseball equipment and is still a going concern.  In 1900 Spalding was appointed by [[William McKinley|President McKinley]] as the USA's Commissioner at that year's [[Summer Olympic Games]].  In 1905, after [[Henry Chadwick (writer)|Henry Chadwick]] wrote an article saying that baseball grew from the British sports of [[cricket]] and [[rounders]], Spalding called for a [[Abraham G. Mills#The Mills Commission|commission]] to find out the real source of baseball. The commission called for citizens who knew anything about the founding of baseball to send in letters. After three years of searching, on December 30, 1907, Spalding received a letter that (erroneously) declared baseball to be the invention of [[Abner Doubleday]]. The commission, though, was biased, as Spalding would appoint anyone to the commission if they believed the sport was somewhat related to the English sport of rounders. Just before the commission, in a letter to sportswriter Tim Murnane, Spalding noted, &quot;Our good old American game of baseball must have an American Dad.&quot; The project, later called the Mills Commission, concluded that &quot;Base Ball had its origins in the United States&quot; and &quot;the first scheme for playing baseball, according to the best evidence available to date, was devised by Abner Doubleday at Cooperstown, N.Y., in 1839.&quot;

Receiving the archives of Henry Chadwick in 1908, Spalding combined these records with his own memories (and biases) to write ''[[America's National Game]]'' (published 1911) which, despite its flaws, was probably the first scholarly account of the [[history of baseball]].

In 1900 he moved to [[San Diego]] and became a prominent member and supporter of the [[Theosophical Society Pasadena|Theosophical]] community [[Lomaland]], which was being developed on [[Point Loma, California|Point Loma]] by [[Katherine Tingley]]. He built an estate in the [[Sunset Cliffs, San Diego|Sunset Cliffs]] area of Point Loma where he lived for the rest of his life. He joined with [[George Marston]] and other civic-minded businessmen to purchase the site of the original [[Presidio of San Diego]], which they developed as a historic park and eventually donated to the city of San Diego.&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, Michael J., ''George White Marston: Baseball Player,'' [http://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:__E-nZ6gtaIJ:www.sandiegohistory.org/journal/v50-3/v50-3%264.pdf+spalding&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESgfgFAb4YxOA5h7qAiF_-8ZUs4NE7NDbA--zUwkBUcmoaYLOh7klkBeidtCxSKZp1f9GgR45-_to8jKXlgG7j48142iAKu5daO01ngcH3I7j8fZm24e-EFikqh7sBZPppONxk6s&amp;sig=AHIEtbQsrohA35wlt0INReUYTNdhetnhWg Journal of San Diego History, Volume 50, nos. 3-4, page 93]&lt;/ref&gt;

He died on September 9, 1915 in [[San Diego]], and was [[cremation|cremated]].&lt;ref name=&quot;retrospalding&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/S/Pspala101.htm|title=Al Spalding's career statistics|work=retrosheet.org|publisher=Retrosheet, Inc|accessdate=25 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;referspalding&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/s/spaldal01.shtml|title=Al Spalding's career statistics|work=baseball-reference.com|publisher=Sports Reference LLC|accessdate=25 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
He was elected to the [[Baseball Hall of Fame]] by the veterans Committee in [[Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1939|1939]]. His nephew, also named [[Albert Spalding (violinist)|Albert Spalding]], was a renowned [[violin]]ist.

The '''Africa Alphabet''' (also '''International African Alphabet''' or '''IAI alphabet''') was developed in 1928 under the lead of [[Diedrich Westermann]]. He developed it with a group of [[African studies|Africanists]] at the International Institute of African Languages and Cultures (later the [[International African Institute|IAI]]) in [[London]]. Its aim was to enable people to write all the [[African languages]] for practical and scientific purposes without [[diacritic]]s.

This alphabet has influenced development of orthographies of many African languages (serving &quot;as the basis for the transcription&quot; of about 60, by one count&lt;ref&gt;Sow, Alfa I., and Mohamed H. Abdulaziz, &quot;Language and Social Change,&quot; Ch. 18 in Ali A. Mazrui (ed.) Africa Since 1935 (UNESCO General History of Africa, Vol. 8). University of California Press, 1993. P. 527.&lt;/ref&gt;), but not all, and discussions of harmonization of systems of transcription that led to, among other things, adoption of the [[African reference alphabet]].

The game was originally published in 1962 by [[3M]] as a part of their [[3M bookshelf game series|bookshelf games series]].  In most versions, the theme of the game is investing in [[hotel]] chains. In the 1990s [[Hasbro]] edition, the hotel chains were replaced by generic corporations, though the actual gameplay was unchanged. The game is currently published by Hasbro under the [[Avalon Hill]] brand, and the companies are once again hotel chains. The game was short-listed for the first [[Spiel des Jahres]] board game awards in 1979.&lt;ref name=&quot;sjd&quot;&gt;Spiel des Jahres page for Acquire in German&lt;/ref&gt;

The object of the game is to earn the most money by developing and merging hotel chains. When a chain in which a player owns stock is acquired by a larger chain, players earn money based on the size of the acquired chain. At the end of the game, all players liquidate their stock in order to determine which player has the most money.

==Components==
The components of the game have varied over the years. In particular, the tiles have been made from wood, plastic, and cardboard in various editions of the game. In the current 2008 version, the tiles are cardboard. The following components are included in all versions:

* Game board with 108 spaces arranged in a 12 by 9 array
* 108 tiles corresponding to the squares in the array
* 7 markers, one for each of the hotel chains: American, Continental, Festival, Imperial, Luxor (or Sackson in the 2008 version), Tower, and Worldwide.
* 25 shares of stock for each of the seven hotel chains
* A supply of play money, in denominations of $100, $500, $1000, and $5000
* 6 charts listing the prices of shares of the chains

The array on the game board is arranged with lettered rows (A through I) and numbered columns (1 through 12). The 108 tiles correspond to each of the squares: 5E, 10B, and so forth.

==Rules==
''Acquire'' is a game for three to six players, though earlier editions included special rules for two players. Standard tournament games are played with four players.

===Setup===
At the beginning of the game, each player receives $6000 in cash. Each player draws a tile and places it on the board. The player whose tile is in the topmost row (closest to row A) goes first. If more than one player selects a tile in that row, then the player whose tile is in the leftmost column (closest to 1) goes first. All players place these tiles on the board. Then, starting with the first player, each player draws six tiles.

===Play of the game===
A turn consists of three steps:

# placing a tile
# buying stock
# drawing a replacement tile

Tile placement falls in one of four categories. The tile placed could be an orphan, adjacent to no other tile on the board. The tile could create a new chain of tiles, and the player who placed it on the board would have the opportunity to found a new chain. The tile could increase the length of an existing chain already on the board.  Or the tile could link two chains, causing a merger of two or more chains. Since there are only seven hotel chains in the game, placing a tile that would create an eighth chain is not permitted.

When a player founds a chain, he receives one free share of stock in that chain. If, however, there are no shares left when the chain is founded, then the founding player does not receive the free share.

Chains are deemed &quot;safe&quot; if they have 11 or more links; placing a tile that would cause such a chain to be acquired by a larger chain is also not permitted.

After a player places a tile, and the results of that placement have been handled, he may purchase up to three shares of stock. A player may only purchase shares of stock in chains that have already been founded. The price of a share depends on the size of the chain, according to a chart that lists prices according to size. A player may purchase shares in one, two, or three existing chains (assuming at least three chains are currently in play), in any combination up to a total of three shares.

Finally, the player replaces the tile he played, ensuring that he has six tiles at the end of his turn.

===Growing and merging chains===
A chain is a conglomeration of tiles that are linked to each other either horizontally or vertically but not diagonally. For example, adjacent to square 5F are squares 4F, 6F, 5E, and 5G, but not 6E or 4G. If there is a tile in 5F, then placing either tile 4F or 5G would result in founding a new hotel chain. A chain grows when a player increases the length of a chain. Suppose a chain consists of squares 8D, 8E, and 8F.  Playing tile 9F would add to the length of the chain.  Playing tile 9E would not.

Chains merge when a player places the tile that eliminates the empty space between them. Suppose there is a chain at 1A, 2A, 3A, and 4A, along with another chain at 6A and 7A. Placing tile 5A would cause these two chains to merge. When a merger occurs, the larger hotel chain always acquires the smaller hotel chain. That is, the hotel chain with more tiles will continue to exist and now grows to include the smaller hotel chain (after bonuses have been calculated according to the steps outlined below). If a tile is placed between two hotel chains of the same size, the individual player who places the tile decides which hotel chain remains on the board and which is acquired. In this situation, there are a number of strategic reasons why an individual player might select one hotel chain over another to be the one that remains on the board. However, often it is most advantageous for the player selecting to choose to let the more expensive chains remain on the board (and trade in their stock of the less expensive chain at the 2-to-1 ratio described below).

===Mergers===
The merger is the mechanism by which the players compete.  Mergers yield bonuses for the two shareholders who hold, respectively, the largest and second-largest interests in a chain. Mergers also give each player who holds any interest at all in a chain a chance to sell his stock or to trade it in for shares of the acquiring chain. A merger takes place in three steps:

# '''Bonuses for majority and minority shareholders.''' Each player counts his or her stock in the acquired chain. The player with the largest number of shares is the &quot;majority&quot; shareholder, and the player with the second-largest number of shares is the &quot;minority&quot; shareholder. If two players tie for majority, they will share both shareholder bonuses. If two players tie for minority, they will share the minority shareholder bonus.&lt;br&gt;Suppose Festival is the chain being acquired. Alex owns 10 shares, Betty owns 8, and Carla owns 6. Alex is the majority shareholder, and Betty is the minority shareholder.&lt;br&gt;Suppose now that Worldwide is the chain being acquired. Alex owns 8 shares, Betty owns 8 shares, and Carla owns 7. Alex and Betty would share the majority and minority bonuses, and Carla would get no bonus.  If instead Betty and Carla both owned 7 shares, then Alex would keep the majority bonus for herself, while Betty and Carla would split the minority bonus.
# '''Sell, trade, or hold shares.''' Starting with the player who caused the merger to happen, each player may either sell his shares in the acquired chain, trade in two shares of the acquired chain for one share of the acquiring chain, or hold on to his shares of the acquired chain. Shares are sold at the same price as the current cost of one share of stock in the acquired chain. A player may trade in as many shares as he owns, but may not trade in one share of the acquired chain for half a share of the acquiring chain.  If a player holds onto his stock, he runs the risk that the acquired chain may not reemerge before the game ends.  If that happens, then he will be holding worthless stock at the end of the game.
# '''Defunct chain.''' The acquired chain then becomes defunct. It is eligible to be founded again if another player founds a chain again in a later turn.

If placing a tile causes three or four chains to merge, then the merger steps are handled between the largest and second-largest chain, then with the third-largest chain, and finally with the smallest chain.

===Rules issues===
The rules allow any player to count the number of shares available in the bank. However, the rules do not specify whether a player should hold his shares of stock face up or face down. That is, the rules do not say whether one player may ask another how many shares of stock he or she owns in a particular chain. Whether this is public or private information should be agreed upon between players before the game begins.

The current rules do not provide for a two-player game. However, the stock market was used as a &quot;third shareholder&quot; in previous versions of the game. By this rule, a tile is drawn whenever a merger is declared. The number on the tile indicates how many shares the stock market owns in the company that is being acquired. The players must compete with the market as well as with each other in order to receive bonuses.

==Ending the game==
Any player may declare the game over at any time during his turn if either of two conditions is true: one chain has 41 or more tiles, or there is at least one chain on the board and every chain on the board has 11 or more tiles.  Upon declaring the game over, the player is allowed to complete his turn (including buying stock).  Ending the game is optional - if he believes it is to his advantage not to end the game, he may refrain from doing so.  Once the game ends, the minority and majority bonuses are paid to the minority and majority holders in each of the remaining chains; each player sells his or her shares of stock in each of the remaining chains; and the player with the most money wins.  Because ending the game is optional, and a player may not realize that he can end it, it is unethical to say &quot;good game&quot;, or in any other way indicate that the came could be ended, until after a player actually has ended the game.

==Corner Cases==
These conditions can be used to handle unusual situations.
# '''Replacing permanently unplayable tiles''' - Per 1999 rules, players can replace permanently unplayable tile (tiles that would merge safe corporations) at the end of their turn. You may continue to replace unplayable tiles (including new unplayable tiles that you draw) until you have six playable tiles or the tile stock is empty.
# '''No playable tiles''' - Per 2008 rules, a player that has no legal plays because all 6 tiles in his or her hand are unplayable may reveal his or her hand, set aside his or her unplayable tiles, and draw six new tiles at the beginning of his or her turn. Tiles set aside are discarded from the game.
# '''Bank doesn't have enough shares to allow everyone to trade in their shares''' -  first choice falls to person causing the merger, followed by other players in order around the table in the order of play.

'''Australian English''' ('''AusE''', '''AuE''', '''AusEng''', '''en-AU'''&lt;ref&gt;&lt;code&gt;en-AU&lt;/code&gt; is the [[language code]] for ''Australian English'' , as defined by [[ISO standard]]s (see [[ISO 639-1]] and [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]]) and [[Internet standard]]s (see [[IETF language tag]]).&lt;/ref&gt;) is the form of the [[English language]] as spoken in [[Australia]].

Australian English is a relatively new dialect of English being just over 200 years old. It began diverging from [[British English]] shortly after the foundation of the Australian penal colony of New South Wales in 1788. The dialect can be described as a new dialect that developed as a result of contact between people who spoke different, mutually intelligible, varieties of English.

==Origins==

Convicts sent to Australia came mostly from large English cities and included a significant proprtion of [[Cockneys]] from London&lt;ref&gt;Moore, B 2008, ''Speaking our language: the story of Australian English'', Oxford University Press, Melbourne, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;. They were joined by free settlers, military personnel and administrators, often with their families. 

The early form of Australian English would have been first spoken by the children of the colonists born into the early colony in Sydney. This very first generation of children created a new dialect that was to become the language of the nation.

The children in the new colony would have been exposed to a wide range of different dialects from all over England but mainly the south east, particularly from London. They would have created the new dialect from factors present in the speech they heard around them in response to their need to express peer solidarity. Even when new settlers arrived, this new dialect of the children would have been strong enough to deflect the influence of new children.

There is evidence from early written sources that a new and distinct dialect was present in the colony by the 1830s.&lt;ref&gt;http://clas.mq.edu.au/australian-voices/history-accent-change&lt;/ref&gt;

===Influences===

A large part of the convict body were also the [[Irish people|Irish]], with at least 25% directly from Ireland, and others indirectly via Britain. There were other populations of convicts from non-English speaking areas of Britain, such as the Welsh and Scots. In 1827 [[Peter Miller Cunningham|Peter Cunningham]], in his book ''Two Years in New South Wales'', reported that native-born white Australians of the time — known as &quot;[[Holey dollar#Australia|currency]] lads and lasses&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, Robert. ''The Fatal Shore''. London: Harvill (1986).&lt;/ref&gt; — spoke with a distinctive accent and vocabulary, different to any of their parents but with a strong Cockney influence. The distinctive accent continued to develop amongst the native born, even after transportation of convicts to Australia ended in 1868, as immigration of free settlers from Britain, Ireland and elsewhere continued.

The first of the [[Australian gold rushes]], in the 1850s, began a much larger wave of immigration which would significantly influence the language. During the 1850s, when the UK was under economic hardship, about two per cent of its population emigrated to the Colony of New South Wales and the Colony of Victoria.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Blainey, 1993, ''The Rush That Never Ended'' (4th ed.) Melbourne University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the changes brought by the gold rushes was &quot;[[Americanization|Americanisation]]&quot; of the language—the introduction of words, spellings, terms and usages from [[North American English]]. The words imported included some later considered to be typically Australian, such as ''dirt'' and ''digger''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bell&quot;&gt;Bell, R. ''Americanization and Australia''. UNSW Press (1998).&lt;/ref&gt; ''Bonzer'', which was once a common Australian slang word meaning &quot;great&quot;, &quot;superb&quot; or &quot;beautiful&quot;, is thought to have been a [[corruption (linguistics)|corruption]] of the American mining term bonanza,&lt;ref&gt;Robert J. Menner, &quot;The Australian Language&quot; ''American Speech'', Vol. 21, No. 2 (April 1946), pp. 120&lt;/ref&gt; which means a rich vein of gold or silver and is itself a loanword from Spanish. As the term was used interchangeably in the early twentieth century with the words boshter and bosker, the derivation from the Spanish 'bonanza' seems unlikely. The influx of American military personnel in World War II brought further American influence; though most words were short-lived;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bell&quot;/&gt; and only ''okay'', ''you guys'' and ''gee'' have persisted.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bell&quot;/&gt;

Since the 1950s the American influence on language in Australia has mostly come from pop culture, the mass media (books, magazines and television programs), computer software and the internet. Some words, such as ''freeway'' and ''truck'', have even been naturalised so completely that few Australians recognise their origin.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bell&quot;/&gt; Some American, British and Australian variants exist side-by-side; in many cases&amp;nbsp;– ''[[freeway]]'' and ''motorway'' (used in New South Wales) for instance&amp;nbsp;– regional, social and ethnic variation within Australia typically defines word usage.&lt;ref&gt;Oliver, Mackay and Rochecouste. 'The Acquisition of Colloquial Terms by Western Australian Primary School Children from Non-English Speaking Backgrounds' in ''Journal of Multilingual and Multicultural Development'' 24:5 (2003), 413–430.&lt;/ref&gt;

Words of Irish origin are used, some of which are also common elsewhere in the Irish diaspora, such as ''tucker'' for &quot;food&quot;, &quot;provisions&quot; (Irish ''tacar''),{{citation needed|date=April 2011}} as well as one or two native English words whose meaning have changed under Irish influence,{{citation needed|date=April 2011}} such as ''paddock'' for &quot;field&quot;, cf. Irish ''páirc'', which has exactly the same meaning as the Australian ''paddock''.

To outsiders, Australian English seems most similar to [[New Zealand English]]. Both use the expression ''different to'' (also encountered in British English, but not American) as well as ''different from'', though sometimes with a semantic difference (''different to'' highlights the &quot;closeness&quot; or &quot;neutrality&quot; of the difference, while ''different from'' highlights the difference).

===Media===

One of the first writers to attempt renditions of Australian accents and vernacular was the novelist [[Joseph Furphy]] (a.k.a. Tom Collins), who wrote a popular account of rural New South Wales and Victoria during the 1880s, ''[[Such is Life]]'' (1903). [[C. J. Dennis]] wrote poems about working class life in Melbourne, such as ''[[The Songs of a Sentimental Bloke]]'' (1915), which was extremely popular and was made into a popular silent film (''[[The Sentimental Bloke]]''; 1919). [[John O'Grady]]'s novel ''[[They're a Weird Mob]]'' has many examples of pseudo-phonetically written Australian speech in Sydney during the 1950s, such as ''&quot;owyergoinmateorright?&quot;'' (&quot;How are you going, mate? All right?&quot;). [[Thomas Keneally]]'s novels set in Australia, particularly ''[[The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith]]'', frequently use vernacular such as &quot;yair&quot; for &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;noth-think&quot; for &quot;nothing&quot;.

One of the most influential books of Australian English is the satirical &quot;Let Stalk Strine&quot; by [[Afferbeck Lauder]]&amp;nbsp;– where &quot;[[Strine]]&quot; is &quot;Australian&quot; and &quot;Afferbeck Lauder&quot; is &quot;alphabetical order&quot; &amp;nbsp;. The book reduces the Australian tendency to shorten and run words together into virtual gibberish. For instance, the term 'Aorta' translates as 'They ought to' as in 'Aorta builda nuvver arber bridge. An aorta stop halfese cars from cummern inner city - so a feller can get twirkon time.' (They ought to build another harbour bridge, and they ought to stop half these cars from coming into the city, so a fellow can get to work on time)

==Variation and changes== &lt;!-- &quot;South African English&quot; links here --&gt;
{{Main|Regional variation in Australian English}}
Three main varieties of Australian English are spoken according to linguists: ''broad'', ''general'' and ''cultivated''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ling.mq.edu.au/speech/phonetics/phonetics/ausenglish/impressionistic.html Robert Mannell, &quot;Impressionistic Studies of Australian English Phonetics&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; They are part of a continuum, reflecting variations in accent. They often, but not always, reflect the social class or educational background of the speaker.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.international.mq.edu.au/globe/default.aspx?id=244&amp;EditionID=162 Australia's unique and evolving sound] Edition 34, 2007 (23 August 2007) – The Macquarie Globe&lt;/ref&gt;

Broad Australian English is recognisable and familiar to English speakers around the world because it is used to identify Australian characters in non-Australian films and television programmes (often in the somewhat artificial &quot;stage&quot; Australian English version). Examples are film/television personalities [[Steve Irwin]] and [[Paul Hogan]]. Slang terms ''[[ocker]]'', for a speaker, and ''[[Strine]]'', a shortening of the word ''Australian'' for the dialect, are used in Australia.

The majority of Australians speak with the general Australian accent. This predominates among modern Australian films and television programmes and is used by, for example, [[Eric Bana]], [[Dannii Minogue]] and [[Hugh Jackman]].

Cultivated Australian English has some similarities to British [[Received Pronunciation]], and is often mistaken for it. Cultivated Australian English is spoken by some within Australian society, for example [[Kevin Rudd]], [[Cyril Ritchard]], [[Errol Flynn]], [[Geoffrey Rush]] and [[Judy Davis]].

===Regional variations and pronunciations===

There are no strong variations in accent and pronunciation across different states and territories. Regional differences in pronunciation and vocabulary are small in comparison to those of the British and American English, and Australian pronunciation is determined less by region than by social, cultural and educational influences. There is some subtle regional variation. In Tasmania and Queensland, words such as &quot;dance&quot; and &quot;grant&quot; are usually heard with the [[Phonological history of English short A#Trap-bath split|older pronunciation]] of these words, using {{IPA|[æː]}}. In South Australia {{IPA|[aː]}} is the norm. In other states both pronunciations can be heard. Some speakers in those areas where {{IPA|[æː]/[æ]}} is found prefer to use {{IPA|[aː]}} in such words as a sign of higher social class.&lt;ref&gt;Crystal, D. (1995). ''Cambridge Encyclopedia of the English Language''. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In words such as &quot;pass&quot;, &quot;can't&quot;, &quot;last&quot;, all regional variants use {{IPA|[aː]}}.

There are a few regionally-distributed phonetic features. Here are some examples: 

'''Centring diphthongs'''

Centring [[diphthongs]], which are the vowels that occur in words like ''ear'', ''beard'' and ''air'', ''sheer''. In [[Western Australia]] there is a trend for centring diphthongs like the vowels in the words &quot;ear&quot; and &quot;air&quot; to be pronounced as full diphthongs (i.e. vowels that require the tongue, jaw and lips to move during their production). Those in the eastern states will tend to pronounce &quot;fear&quot; and &quot;sheer&quot; like &quot;fee&quot; and &quot;she&quot; respectively, without any jaw movement, while the westerners would pronounce them like &quot;fia&quot; and &quot;shia&quot;, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;http://clas.mq.edu.au/australian-voices/regional-accents&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Salary vs. Celery'''

In Victoria, many speakers have interesting vowels in words like &quot;alps&quot; and &quot;Alan&quot; and also &quot;Ellen&quot; and &quot;elk&quot;. For many young speakers from Victoria, the first vowel in &quot;celery&quot; and &quot;salary&quot; are the same, so that both words sound like &quot;[[salary]]&quot;. The speaker from Victoria will also tend to say &quot;halicopter&quot; instead of &quot;helicopter&quot;. This feature is present in [[New Zealand English]] as well.

For some, mainly older, speakers from [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], the words &quot;celery&quot; and &quot;salary&quot; also sound the same but instead both sound like &quot;celery&quot;. Most older Victorians will tends to say &quot;elps&quot; compared to the speaker from NSW, that say &quot;alps&quot;. 

'''School'''

The vowel in words like &quot;pool&quot;, &quot;school&quot; and &quot;fool&quot; varies regionally. People who live in the [[South Australia]] will tend to say &quot;pool&quot; and &quot;school&quot; like &quot;pewl&quot; and &quot;skewl&quot;, respectively, while the rest of the Australian population pronounces them as they are spelt.

'''Hurled'''

The tendency for some ''/l/'' sounds to become vowels (''/l/'' [[vocalisation]]) is more common in South Australia than other states. &quot;Hurled&quot; in South Australia has a vocalised /l/ whereas the word as said from New South Wales does not. For the New South Wales speaker the /l/ is pronounced as a consonant.

'''France'''

In Australian English, words vary regionally according to the type of vowel that occurs before the sounds &quot;ns, nt, nch, mple&quot;, in words like &quot;chance, plant, branch, sample&quot; and in words containing the suffix &quot;-mand&quot;, e.g., &quot;demand&quot;. The typical pronunciation for this vowel is the short /æ/ vowel like the vowel in &quot;cat&quot; but there are many speakers who use the vowel in &quot;cart&quot; in these words, particularly in [[South Australia]]. The long vowel is also used in New Zealand. This is probably the result of later settlement.

South Australia had a different settlement chronology and type than other parts of the country and does appear to have a number of regionally-based features.

===Ethnocultural varieties of Australian English===

Whilst the standard Australian English is the main dialect of Australian-born citizens, it is also used by the majority of [[migrants]] who arrive during childhood or early adolescence when local companion influence is at its greatest. The children of immigrant families generally adopt the majority speech patterns of the adopted country rather than those of their parents due to children's need to conform to their peer group. 

Over the past 20 years, there has been extensive [[sociopolitical]] change in Australia. [[Multiculturalism]] as a governmental policy has led to substantial [[immigration]] from [[Asia]] and the [[Middle East]] and has contributed to a large increase in cultural diversity and the desire for individuals to freely express their cultural identity within the Australian context. This has resulted in an increase in the variety of dialects spoken by young people in Australia. Today there is a growing trend for Australian-born children of migrants from non-English speaking backgrounds to embrace their cultural heritage and express their niche identities by using new Australian Ethnocultural dialects.

Ethnocultural varieties of Australian English are minority dialects. They contain features of Standard Australian English combined with some non-English language features. Ethnocultural varieties are Australian English dialects and should not be considered foreign accented English. They may be spoken by Australian-born people who have English as their first language but many speakers of ethnocultural varieties also speak a language other than English. There are potentially many different varieties of Ethnocultural Australian English however few have been the subject of extensive research.

==Phonology==
{{Main|Australian English phonology}}
[[Image:Australian English vowel chart.svg|thumb|right|Australian monophthongs]]
[[Image:Australian English diphthong chart.svg|thumb|right|Australian diphthongs]]
Australian English is a [[Rhotic and non-rhotic accents|non-rhotic]] accent and it is similar to the other Southern Hemisphere accents ([[New Zealand English]] and [[South African English]]).&lt;ref&gt;Trudgill, Peter and Jean Hannah. (2002). ''International English: A Guide to the Varieties of Standard English'', 4th ed. London: Arnold. ISBN 0-340-80834-9, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Like most dialects of English it is distinguished primarily by its vowel [[phonology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Harrington, J., F. Cox, and Z. Evans |title=An acoustic phonetic study of broad, general, and cultivated Australian English vowels |journal=Australian Journal of Linguistics |year=1997 |volume=17 |pages=155–84 |doi=10.1080/07268609708599550 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The vowels of Australian English can be divided into two categories: long and short vowels. The short vowels, consisting only of [[monophthong]]s, mostly correspond to the lax vowels used in analyses of Received Pronunciation. The long vowels, consisting of both monophthongs and [[diphthong]]s, mostly correspond to its tense vowels and centring diphthongs. Unlike most varieties of English, it has a [[vowel length|phonemic length distinction]]: that compresses, shortens or removes these features.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

*Many speakers have also [[English consonant cluster reductions#Yod-coalescence|coalesced]] {{IPA|/dj/}}, {{IPA|/sj/}} and {{IPA|/tj/}} into {{IPA|/dʒ/}}, {{IPA|/ʃ/}} and {{IPA|/tʃ/}}, producing standard pronunciations such as {{IPA|[t͡ʃʰʉːn]}} for ''tune''.

*''t'', ''dd'' and ''s'' in the combinations ''tr'', ''dr'' and ''sr'' (this latter loan words only) also fall in with {{IPA|/dʒ/}}, {{IPA|/ʃ/}} and {{IPA|/tʃ/}} for many speakers, and for all speakers in the case of ''sr'' in loan words, thus ''tree'' {{IPA|/tʃɹiː/}}, ''draw'' {{IPA|/dʒɹɔː/}} and ''Sri Lanka'' {{IPA|/ʃɹiˈlæŋkə/}}.

* In colloquial speech intervocalic {{IPA|/t/}} undergoes voicing and [[flapping]] to the [[alveolar tap]] {{IPA|[ɾ]}} after the stressed syllable and before unstressed vowels (as in ''bu'''tt'''er'', ''par'''t'''y'') and syllabic {{IPA|/l/}}, though not before syllabic {{IPA|/n/}} (''bo'''tt'''le'' vs ''bu'''tt'''on'' {{IPA|[batn]}}), as well as at the end of a word or morpheme before any vowel (''wha'''t''' else'', ''wha'''t'''ever''). In formal speech {{IPA|/t/}} is retained. However, the alveolar flap is normally distinguishable by Australians from the intervocalic alveolar stop {{IPA|/d/}}, which is not flapped, thus ''ladder'' and ''latter'', ''metal'' and ''medal,'' and ''coating'' and ''coding'' remain distinct; further, when ''coating'' becomes ''coatin' '', the '''t''' remains voiceless, thus {{IPA|[kʌutn]}}. This is a quality that Australian English shares with some other varieties of English.

* Intervocalic {{IPA|/nt/}} in fast speech can be realised as {{IPA|[n]}}, another trait shared other varieties of English at the colloquial or dialect level, though in formal speech the full form {{IPA|/nt/}} is retained. This makes ''winter'' and ''winner'' homophones in fast speech. 1999 was a great year for EFL teachers in Australia to illustrate this : &quot;nineen-niny-nine&quot;.

===Characteristics===

'''''Linking /r/'''''

Australian English is [[non-rhotic]] accent, which means that it does not allow '''/r/'' sounds before pauses or before other consonants. So the words “car” and “card” will not contain the ''/r/'' sound. However, the ''/r/'' sound can occur when a word that has a final “r” in the spelling comes before another word that starts with a vowel. For example, in “car alarm” the sound ''/r/'' can occur in “car” because here it comes before another word beginning with a vowel. This is called a linking /r/. The words “far”, “far more” and “farm” do not contain an /r/ but “far out” will contain the linking /r/ sound because the next word starts with a vowel sound.

'''''Intrusive /r/'''''

Australian English speakers may also use intrusive or epenthetic ''/r/''. This is when an ''/r/'' may be inserted before a vowel in words that do not have “r” in the spelling. For example, &quot;drawing&quot; will sound like &quot;draw-ring&quot; and &quot;saw it&quot; like sound like &quot;sore it&quot;.

'''''Intonation - high rising tune'''''

Perhaps of the American influence, some Australian English speakers commonly use a form of upward inflection in their [[speech]] that is not associated with asking [[questions]]. In English, upward inflection (a rise in the [[pitch]] of the voice at the end of a [[sentence]]) typically signals a question. However, some speakers also use upward inflection as a way of including their conversational partner in the dialogue. As such, they are an important interactive tool. This is also common in [[Californian English]].&lt;ref&gt;http://clas.mq.edu.au/voices/audio-illustrations&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''/j/'''''

The sound /j/ occurs in Australian English at the beginning of words like &quot;yellow&quot; and &quot;yes&quot; and it also occurs in words like &quot;new&quot; and &quot;tube&quot;. Palatalisation also typically occurs now in young speakers where ''/tj/'', ''/dj/'', ''/sj/'' and ''/zj/'' become single [[affricate]] or fricative sounds: For example in &quot;tube&quot;, and &quot;tune&quot;, the /tj/ sound becomes the affricate &quot;ch&quot;. An affricate also occurs in &quot;dune&quot;, where it will be pronounced exactly like &quot;june&quot;.

'''''Bad-lad split'''''

A long ''/æ/'' sound is found in the adjectives “bad, mad, glad and sad”, before the sound ''/g/'' (for example, “hag, rag, bag”) and also in content words before /m/ and /n/ in the same syllable (for example, “ham, tan, plant”). The long vowel is retained when suffixes are added such as in madder. 

'''''Nasality - Vowels before 'N' 'M''''''

The [[nasal]] sounds create changes in preceding vowels because air can flow into the nose during the vowel. Nasal consonants can also affect the articulation of a vowel. For some speakers words like &quot;land&quot;, &quot;man&quot;, &quot;band&quot;, &quot;stand&quot;, &quot;can&quot; and &quot;hand&quot; will contain a [[vowel]] that sounds similar to a long ''/e/'' vowel, which is the vowel in &quot;head&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;http://clas.mq.edu.au/australian-voices/further-study&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vocabulary==&lt;!-- This section is linked from England --&gt;
{{Main|Australian English vocabulary}}
Australian English has many words that some consider unique to the language. One of the best known is ''[[outback]]'', meaning a remote, sparsely populated area. Another is ''[[The Bush]]'', meaning either a native forest or a country area in general. 'Bush' is a word of Dutch origin: 'Bosch'. However, both terms have been widely used in many English-speaking countries. Early settlers from England brought other similar words, phrases and usages to Australia. Many words used frequently by country Australians are, or were, also used in all or part of England, with variations in meaning. For example, ''creek'' in Australia, as in North America, means a stream or small river, whereas in the UK it means a small watercourse flowing into the sea; ''paddock'' in Australia means field, whereas in the UK it means a small enclosure for livestock; ''bush'' or ''scrub'' in Australia, as in North America, means a wooded area, whereas in England they are commonly used only in proper names (such as [[Shepherd's Bush]] and [[Wormwood Scrubs]]). Australian English and several British English dialects (for example, [[Cockney]], [[Scouse]], [[Glasgow patter|Glaswegian]] and [[Geordie]]) use the word ''[[Mate (colloquialism)|mate]]''.

The origins of other words are not as clear or are disputed. ''Dinkum'' (or &quot;fair dinkum&quot;) can mean &quot;true&quot;, &quot;is that true?&quot; or &quot;this is the truth!” among other things, depending on context and inflection. It is often claimed that dinkum dates back to the [[Australian goldrushes]] of the 1850s, and that it is derived from the [[Yue Chinese|Cantonese]] (or Hokkien) ''ding kam'', meaning, &quot;top gold&quot;. But scholars give greater credence to the conjecture that it originated from the extinct [[East Midlands]] dialect in England, where dinkum (or dincum) meant &quot;hard work&quot; or &quot;fair work&quot;, which was also the original meaning in Australian English.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anu.edu.au/andc/pubs/ozwords/November_98/index.html Frederick Ludowyk, 1998, &quot;Aussie Words: The Dinkum Oil On Dinkum; Where Does It Come From?&quot; (''0zWords'', Australian National Dictionary Centre)]. Access date: 5 November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The derivative ''dinky-di'' means 'true' or devoted: a 'dinky-di Aussie' is a 'true Australian'. However, this expression is limited to describing objects or actions that are characteristically Australian. The words ''dinkum'' or ''dinky-di'' and phrases like ''true blue'' are widely purported to be typical Australian sayings, even though they are more commonly used in jest or parody than as authentic slang.

Similarly, ''g'day'', a stereotypical Australian greeting, is no longer synonymous with &quot;good day&quot; in other varieties of English and is never used as an expression for &quot;farewell&quot;, as &quot;good day&quot; is in other countries. It is simply used as a greeting.

==Influence of Australian Aboriginal languages==

Some elements of [[Australian Aboriginal languages|Aboriginal languages]] and [[Torres Strait Island languages]] have been [[List of English words of Australian Aboriginal origin|adopted by Australian English]]&amp;nbsp;– mainly as names for places, flora and fauna (for example [[dingo]]) and local culture. Many such are localised, and do not form part of general Australian use, while others, such as ''kangaroo'', ''boomerang'', ''budgerigar'', ''wallaby'' and so on have become international. Beyond that, little has been adopted into the wider language, except for some localised terms and slang. Some examples are ''[[cooee]]'' and ''hard [[yakka]]''. The former is used as a high-pitched call, for attracting attention, (pronounced {{IPA|/kʉː.iː/}}) which travels long distances. ''Cooee'' is also a notional distance: ''if he's within cooee, we'll spot him''. ''Hard yakka'' means ''hard work'' and is derived from ''yakka'', from the {{noredlink|Yagara}}/{{noredlink|Jagara}} language once spoken in the Brisbane region. Also from there is the word ''bung'', from the Sydney [[pidgin]] English (and ultimately from the Sydney Aboriginal language), and originally meaning &quot;dead&quot;, and now meaning &quot;broken&quot; or &quot;caused to be less than perfect&quot;, such as &quot;a bung knee&quot;, which is a knee that does not work properly for whatever reason, such as stiffness, pain, arthritis, an accident, or something like that. A failed piece of equipment may be described as having ''bunged up'' or as &quot;on the bung&quot; or &quot;gone bung&quot;.

Although ''[[didgeridoo]]'', referring to a well-known wooden musical instrument, is often thought of as an Aboriginal word, it is now believed to be an [[onomatopoeia|onomatopoeic]] word invented by English speakers. It has also been suggested that it may have an Irish or Scottish Gaelic derivation because the word ''dúdaire'' means &quot;piper&quot; in Gaelic, and ''dúdaire dubh'' [du:dɪrʲɪ du:] means 'black pipe player'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anu.edu.au/andc/ozwords/Nov%202002/Didgeridoo.html Dymphna Lonergan, 2002, &quot;Aussie Words: Didgeridoo; An Irish Sound In Australia&quot; (''0zWords'', Australian National Dictionary Centre)]. Access date: 5 November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Many towns or suburbs of Australia have also been influenced or named after Aboriginal words. The most well known example is the capital, Canberra named after a local language word meaning &quot;meeting place&quot;.

==Spelling==&lt;!-- [[Australian spelling]] redirects here--&gt;
Australian spelling generally follows conventions of British English. As in British spelling, the 'u' is retained in words such as ''honour'' and ''favour'' and the -ise ending is used in words such as ''organise'' and ''realise'', although -ize may be tolerated, and occasionally appears in official contexts.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

As in most English speaking countries, there is no official governmental regulator or overseer of correct spelling and grammar. Dictionaries such as the ''[[Macquarie Dictionary]]'' and the ''[[Australian Oxford Dictionary]]'' have provided a compendium of words and spellings, but often include variants of spellings for certain words regardless of their commonality.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} This can lead to confusion about what is correct or acceptable spelling in Australian English.

There was a widely held belief in Australia that controversies over spelling resulted from the &quot;Americanisation&quot; of Australian English; the influence of American English in the late 20th century, but the debate over spelling is much older. For example, a pamphlet entitled ''The So-Called &quot;American Spelling&quot;'', published in Sydney some time before 1901, argued that &quot;there is no valid etymological reason for the preservation of the ''u'' in such words as ''honor'', ''labor'', etc.&quot;,&lt;ref name = &quot;ljnijo&quot;&gt;''The So Called &quot;American Spelling.&quot; Its Consistency Examined.'' pre-1901 pamphlet, Sydney, E. J. Forbes. Quoted by Annie Potts in [http://www.bikwil.com/Vintage19/Webster's-Dictionary.html this article]&lt;/ref&gt; alluding to older British spellings which also used the ''-or'' ending. The pamphlet also claimed that &quot;the tendency of people in Australasia is to excise the u, and one of the Sydney morning papers habitually does this, while the other generally follows the older form.&quot; Newspapers are not always a reliable guide to community preference and usage,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2002/03/26/1017089533671.html &quot;A bevan by any other name could be a bogan&quot;; Don Woolford; ''The Age''; 27 March 2002]:  &lt;blockquote&gt;Given a choice between &quot;colour&quot; and &quot;color&quot;, 95 per cent chose the former, surprising given that many newspapers drop the &quot;u&quot;.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; as they are often more concerned about saving space.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.designwrite.ca/g-tips.html designwrite.ca: ''The Serial Comma''.]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, ''circa'' 2007 Melbourne newspaper ''[[The Age]]'' finally changed its longstanding policy of omitting the u, in response to continuing complaints from its readers.&lt;ref&gt;Reported in the pages of ''[[The Age]]'' at the time.  Precise date T.B.C.  Compare also with [http://blogs.usyd.edu.au/elac/2008/01/webster_in_australia.html ''Webster in Australia'' by James McElvenny]: &quot;&lt;nowiki&gt;[...]&lt;/nowiki&gt; ''the'' Age newspaper used the reformed spellings up to the end of the 1990s.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|date=April 2011}} One of the two major political parties is the [[Australian Labor Party]], spelt without a 'u', with the atypical spelling dating back to 1912 as what was then an attempt to &quot;modernise&quot; the name. The main champion of the spelling change was [[King O'Malley]], a major figure in the party's early history, who publicly claimed to have been born in Canada but was most likely born in the US and spent (almost) all of the first 30 years of his life in the US. It should also be noted that in its early years, the ALP was significantly influenced by the US labour movement.

Words listed by the Macquarie Dictionary as currently often spelled differently to the received British spellings include &quot;program&quot; as opposed to &quot;programme&quot; and &quot;jail&quot; as opposed to &quot;gaol&quot; (although the traditional spellings may still be found in government documents or names such as [[Boggo Road Gaol]]).&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Macquarie Dictionary&quot;, Third Edition.  The Macquarie Library Pty Ltd, 1997, p. 1139 and pp. 1706-1707.&lt;/ref&gt;

For a short time during the late 20th Century, [[Harry Lindgren]]'s 1969 spelling reform proposal ([[SR1|''Spelling Reform 1'' or ''SR1'']]) was popular in Australia and was adopted by the [[Government of Australia|Australian government]]. SR1 calls for the short /e/ sound (as in ''bet'') to be spelt with E (for example ''friend→frend, head→hed''). In [[Geoffrey Sampson]]'s book ''Writing Systems'' (1985) he wrote that SR1 &quot;has been adopted widely by Australians. Many general interest paperbacks and the like are printed in SR1; under [[Gough Whitlam]]'s Labor Government the ''Australian Ministry of Helth'' was officially so spelled (though, when Whitlam was replaced by a liberal administration, it reintroduced orthographic conservatism)&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Sampson, Geoffrey. ''Writing Systems''. Stanford University Press, 1990. p.197.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;adv=yes;orderBy=date-eLast;page=0;query=(Dataset%3Ahansardr,hansardr80)%20Decade%3A%221970s%22%20Year%3A%221973%22%20HELTH%20everingham;rec=0;resCount=Default Second Reading (Budget Debate) APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 1) 1973-74 in Australian House of Representatives Hansard]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.englishspellingsociety.org/journals/j9/sr1.php&lt;/ref&gt;

==Colloquialisms==
[[Diminutive]]s are commonly used and are often used to indicate familiarity. Some common examples are ''arvo'' (afternoon), ''barbie'' (barbecue), ''[[smoko]]'' (originally a smoking break, now often used to refer to morning tea), ''Aussie'' (Australian) and ''pressie'' (present (gift)). The last two are pronounced {{IPA|/ˈɒzi/}} and {{IPA|/ˈprɛzi/}} respectively, never with a voiceless 's'.

This may also be done with people's names to create [[nickname]]s (other English speaking countries create [[Diminutive#English|similar diminutives]]). For example, &quot;[[Gazza]]&quot; from Gary.

Incomplete comparisons are sometimes used, such as &quot;sweet as&quot;.

&quot;Full&quot; or &quot;fully&quot; may precede a word to act as an intensifier. This is more common in regional Australia.

The suffix &quot;-ly&quot; is sometimes omitted in broader Australian English. For instance &quot;real good&quot; in lieu of &quot;really good.&quot;

South Australia's use of the expression &quot;heaps good&quot; is well known in Australia. The expression is used in some South Australian tourism advertisements. The augmentation &quot;heaps&quot; can be heard throughout Eastern Australia, along with &quot;way&quot; and &quot;far.&quot;

[[Litotes]], such as &quot;not bad&quot;, &quot;not much&quot; and &quot;you're not wrong&quot;, are sometimes used.

Many idiomatic phrases and words once common in Australian English are now stereotypes and caricatured exaggerations, and have disappeared from everyday use. Such outdated and parodied terms include ''strewth'', ''you beaut'' and ''crikey'', though these may still be heard in rural areas.

''[[Waltzing Matilda]]'' written by bush poet [[Banjo Paterson]] contains many obsolete Australian words and phrases that appeal to a rural ideal and are understood by Australians even though they are not in common usage outside the song. One example is the title, which means travelling, particularly with a [[Swag (bedroll)|swag]].

'''American Airlines Flight 77''' was [[American Airlines]]' morning, daily scheduled [[transcontinental flight]], from [[Washington Dulles International Airport]], in [[Dulles, Virginia]] to [[Los Angeles International Airport]] in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]]. On Tuesday, September 11, 2001, the aircraft flying this route—a [[Boeing 757|Boeing 757-223]]—was [[Aircraft hijacking|hijacked]] by five [[al-Qaeda]] terrorists and deliberately crashed into [[the Pentagon]], as part of the [[September 11 attacks]].

Less than 35&amp;nbsp;minutes into the flight, the hijackers stormed the cockpit and forced the passengers to the rear of the aircraft. [[Hani Hanjour]], one of the hijackers who was trained as a pilot, assumed control of the flight. Unknown to the hijackers, passengers aboard were able to make telephone calls to loved ones and relay information on the hijacking.

The aircraft crashed into the western side of the Pentagon at 09:37 [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]]. All 64 people on board the aircraft, including the hijackers, were killed, as were 125 people in the building. Dozens of people witnessed the crash and news sources began reporting on the incident within minutes. The impact severely damaged an area of the Pentagon and ignited a large fire. A portion of the Pentagon collapsed; firefighters spent days trying to fully extinguish the blaze. The damaged sections of the Pentagon were rebuilt in 2002, with occupants moving back into the completed areas on August 15, 2002.

The 184 victims of the attack are memorialized in the [[Pentagon Memorial]] adjacent to the Pentagon. The {{convert|1.93|acre|m2|sing=on}} park consists of 184 benches, one for each of the victims, arranged according to their year of birth, ranging from 1930 (aged 71) to 1998 (aged 3).

== Hijackers ==
The hijackers on American Airlines Flight&amp;nbsp;77 were led by [[Hani Hanjour]], who piloted the aircraft into the Pentagon.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimes1&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Chen |first=David W |title= A Nation Challenged: The Suspect; Man Traveled Across U.S. In His Quest to Be a Pilot |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F03EFDF153BF93BA2575AC0A9679C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=1 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=2001-09-18 |accessdate=2008-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hanjour first came to the United States in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Yardley |first=Jim |coauthors=Thomas, Jo |title= Traces of Terror: The F.B.I.; For Agent in Phoenix, the Cause of Many Frustrations Extended to His Own Office |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0DE0DD173FF93AA25755C0A9649C8B63 |date=2002-06-19 |work = The New York Times |accessdate=2008-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; He trained at the CRM Airline Training Center in [[Scottsdale, Arizona]], earning his [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]] [[Commercial Pilot License|commercial pilot's certificate]] in April&amp;nbsp;1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Four Planes, Four Coordinated Teams |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/nation/graphics/attack/hijackers.html |work=[[The Washington Post]] |year=2001 |accessdate=2001-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had wanted to be a commercial pilot for the [[Saudi Arabian Airlines|Saudi national airline]] but was rejected when he applied to the civil aviation school in [[Jeddah]] in 1999.

=== Suspected accomplices ===

According to U.S. State Department cable of February 2010, released by [[Wikileaks]] in 2011, the FBI has investigated another suspect, Mohammed al-Mansoori, who had associated with three Qatari citizens who had flown from Washington to London on the eve of the attacks, after allegedly surveying the World Trade Center and the White House. U.S. law enforcement officials said that the information about the four men was &quot;just one of many leads that were thoroughly investigated at the time and never led to terrorism charges&quot;. An official added, however, that the three Qatari citizens have never been questioned by the FBI. [[Eleanor Hill]], the former staff director for the congressional joint inquiry on the September 11 attacks, said the cable reinforces questions about the thoroughness of the FBI's investigation. She also said that the inquiry concluded that the hijackers had a support network that helped them in different ways. The three Qatari men were booked to fly from Los Angeles to Washington on Sept. 10, 2001, on the same plane that was hijacked and piloted into the Pentagon on the following day, but did instead fly from Los Angeles to Qatar, via London. While the cable states that Mansoori would be currently under investigation, U.S. law enforcement officials said that was no active investigation of him or of the Qatari citizens mentioned in the cable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Isikoff|first=Michael|publisher=MSNBC|title=WikiLeaks cable revives talk of 9/11 support network|date=February 2, 2011|url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/41400106/ns/us_news-security/|accessdate=February 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Boarding ===
On the morning of September 11, 2001, the five hijackers arrived at [[Dulles International Airport]], outside of [[Washington, D.C.]]  At 07:15, [[Khalid al-Mihdhar]] and [[Majed Moqed]] checked-in at the American Airlines ticket counter for Flight 77,&lt;ref name=&quot;911-ch1&quot;&gt;{{cite book |chapter='We Have Some Planes' |url=http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/911/report/911Report_Ch1.htm |year=2004 |title=9/11 Commission Report |publisher=National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States |accessdate=2008-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they arrived at the passenger security checkpoint a few minutes later at 07:18.&lt;ref name=&quot;staff3&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.9-11commission.gov/staff_statements/staff_statement_3.pdf |format=PDF|title=The Aviation Security System and the 9/11 Attacks - Staff Statement No. 3 |work=National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States |accessdate=2008-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Both men set off the metal detector and were put through secondary screening.

The screener at the checkpoint never resolved what set off the alarm.  As seen in security footage later released, Nawaf Hazmi appeared to have an unidentified item in his back pocket, but four-inch [[utility knife|utility knives]] were nonetheless permitted by the FAA as carry-on items.&lt;ref name=&quot;911-ch1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;dullesvideo&quot;/&gt;  The passenger security checkpoint at Dulles International Airport was operated by [[Argenbright Security]], under contract with [[United Airlines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Orecklin |first=Michele |coauthors=Land, Greg |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1001252,00.html |title=Why Argenbright Sets Off Alarms |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=2001-11-19 |accessdate=2008-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hijackers were also all selected for extra screening of their checked bags. Hani Hanjour, Khalid al-Mihdhar, and Majed Moqed were chosen by the [[Computer Assisted Passenger Prescreening System]] criteria, while Nawaf al-Hazmi and Salem al-Hazmi were selected because they did not provide adequate identification and were deemed suspicious by the airline check-in agent.

=== Hijacking ===
The [[9/11 Commission]] estimated that the flight was hijacked between 08:51 and 08:54, just minutes after [[American Airlines Flight 11|the first hijacked plane]] had struck the [[World Trade Center]] in [[Manhattan]] at 08:46. The last normal radio communications from the aircraft to [[air traffic control]] occurred at 08:50:51.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Gregor |first=Joseph A. |url=http://www.ntsb.gov/info/ATC_%20Report_AA77.pdf |format=PDF|title=ATC Report American Airlines Flight 77 |publisher=National Transportation Safety Board |date=2001-12-21 |accessdate=2008-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; At 08:54, American Airlines Flight&amp;nbsp;77 began to deviate from its normal, assigned flight path and turned south.&lt;ref name=&quot;911-ch1&quot;/&gt; The hijackers set the flight's [[autopilot]] heading for Washington, D.C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ntsb.gov/info/autopilot_AA77_UA93_study.pdf |format=PDF|title=Study of Autopilot, Navigation Equipment, and Fuel Consumption Activity Based on United Airlines Flight&amp;nbsp;93 and American Airlines Flight&amp;nbsp;77 Digital Flight Data Recorder Information |last=O'Callaghan |first=John |coauthors=Bower, Daniel |publisher=National Transportation Safety Board |date=2002-02-13 |accessdate=2008-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 08:56, the flight was turned around, and the [[transponder]] had been disabled. The [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]] was aware at this point that there was an emergency aboard the plane. By this time, [[American Airlines Flight 11]] had already crashed into the [[World Trade Center]], and [[United Airlines Flight 175]] was known to have been hijacked and within minutes of also striking the World Trade Center. After learning of this second hijacking involving American Airlines aircraft and the hijacking involving [[United Airlines]], American Airlines Executive Vice President Gerard Arpey ordered a nationwide ground stop for the airline.&lt;ref name=&quot;911-ch1&quot;/&gt; The Indianapolis Air Traffic Control Center, as well as American Airlines dispatchers, made several failed attempts to contact the aircraft. At the time the plane was hijacked, it was flying over an area of limited radar coverage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wash4&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Phillips |first=Don |title=Pentagon Crash Highlights a Radar Gap; Limited System in One Area Made Flight&amp;nbsp;77 Invisible to Controllers for Half-Hour |date=2001-11-03 |work = The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; With air controllers unable to contact the flight by radio, an Indianapolis official declared that the plane had possibly crashed at 09:09.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wash4&quot; /&gt;

Two people on American Airlines Flight&amp;nbsp;77 made phone calls to contacts on the ground. At 09:12, flight attendant Renee May called her mother, Nancy May, in Las Vegas.&lt;ref name=&quot;Summary&quot; /&gt; During the call, which lasted nearly two minutes, May said her flight was being hijacked by six individuals and they had been moved to the rear of the plane.&lt;ref name=&quot;911-ch1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Summary&quot; /&gt; May also asked her mother to contact American Airlines, which she and her husband promptly did.&lt;ref name=&quot;911-ch1&quot;/&gt; American Airlines was already aware of the hijacking.

Rescue efforts began immediately after the crash. Almost all the successful rescues of survivors occurred within half an hour of the impact.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pent51&quot;&gt;Goldberg et al., p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, rescue efforts were led by the military and civilian employees within the building.

As firefighters attempted to extinguish the fires, they watched the building in fear of a structural collapse. One firefighter remarked that they &quot;pretty much knew the building was going to collapse because it started making weird sounds and creaking&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pent80&quot; /&gt; Officials saw a cornice of the building move and ordered an evacuation. Minutes later, at 10:10, the upper floors of the damaged area of the Pentagon collapsed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pent80&quot; /&gt; The collapse area was about {{convert|95|ft|m|0}} at its widest point and {{convert|50|ft|m|0}} at its deepest.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pent80&quot; /&gt; This amount of time between impact and collapse allowed everyone on the fourth and fifth levels to evacuate safely before the structure collapsed.&lt;ref&gt;Goldberg et al., p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; After the collapse, the interior fires intensified, spreading through all five floors.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pent86&quot;&gt;Goldberg et al., pp. 86–90.&lt;/ref&gt; After 11:00, firefighters mounted a two-pronged attack against the fires. Officials estimated temperatures of up to {{convert|2000|°F|°C}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pent86&quot; /&gt; While progress was made against the interior fires by late afternoon, firefighters realized a flammable layer of wood under the Pentagon's slate roof had caught fire and begun to spread.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pent91&quot;&gt;Goldberg et al., pp. 91–95.&lt;/ref&gt; Typical firefighting tactics were rendered useless by the reinforced structure as firefighters were unable to reach the fire to extinguish it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pent91&quot; /&gt; Firefighters instead made [[firebreak]]s in the roof on September 12 to prevent any further spreading.

At around 3:40 a.m on September 14, a paramedic and a firefighter who were searching through the debris of the impact site found two dark boxes, about {{convert|1.5|ft|cm}} by {{convert|2|ft|cm}} long.

=== Continuity of operations ===
At the moment of impact, [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] [[Donald Rumsfeld]] was in his office on the other side of the Pentagon, away from the crash site. He ran to the site and assisted the injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Vobejda |first=Barbara |title='Extensive Casualties' in Wake of Pentagon Attack |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/metro/daily/sep01/attack.html |work=The Washington Post |date=2001-09-11 |accessdate=2008-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rumsfeld then returned to his office, and went to a conference room in the Executive Support Center where he joined a secure videoteleconference with Vice President [[Dick Cheney]] and other officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Creed, Patrick and Rick Newman |title=Firefight: Inside the Battle to Save the Pentagon on 9/11 |year=2008 |publisher=Presidio Press |isbn=0-89141-905-5 |pages=276–277}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On the day of the attacks, Department of Defense officials considered moving command operations to [[Site R]], a backup facility in [[Pennsylvania]].  Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld insisted he remain at the Pentagon, instead sending Deputy Secretary [[Paul Wolfowitz]] to Site R.

Early estimates on rebuilding the damaged section of the Pentagon were that it would take three years to complete.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wash-oct01&quot;/&gt;  However, the project moved forward at an accelerated pace and was completed by the one-year anniversary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://archives.cnn.com/2002/US/09/04/ar911.pentagon.reconstruction/ |title=Project Phoenix: Pentagon offices rise from rubble |publisher=CNN |date=2002-09-04 |accessdate=2008-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The rebuilt section of the Pentagon includes a small indoor memorial and chapel at the point of impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/09/AR2006090900576.html |title=Public Honors 9/11 Fallen at Pentagon |publisher=Washington Post |date=2006-09-09 |accessdate=2010-08-13 | first=Kevin | last=Freking}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An [[Pentagon Memorial|outdoor memorial]], designed by Julie Beckman and Keith Kaseman, was completed on schedule for its dedication on September 11, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Shaughnessy |first=Larry |url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/US/05/23/pentagon.memorial/ |title= Nearly complete Pentagon memorial tells story of 9/11 |publisher=CNN |date=2008-05-24 |accessdate=2008-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In keeping with standard airline procedure after disasters, the flight number was changed after the incident.  American's morning flight from Dulles to Los Angeles is now Flight 149, and uses a Boeing 737-800 instead of a 757-200. An American flag was placed on top of Gate D26 from which Flight 77 departed Dulles, even though gate D26 is now used by United Airlines. After the attacks, American Airlines decided to move its gates at Dulles from the D Concourse to the B concourse. This move was to occur weeks after the attacks, but did not end up happening until early 2006.{{citation needed|date=July 2010}}

=== Security camera video ===
[[File:Pentagon Security Camera 2.ogv|thumb|right|thumbtime=0:29|Second security camera video]]
On May 16, 2006, the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] released filmed footage that was recorded by a security camera of American Airlines Flight&amp;nbsp;77 crashing into the Pentagon, with a plane visible in one frame, as a &quot;thin white blur&quot; and an explosion following.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |agency=Associated Press |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/12818225/ |title=Video of 9/11 plane hitting Pentagon is released |publisher=MSNBC |date=2006-05-16 |accessdate=2008-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The images were made public in response to a December 2004 [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] request by [[Judicial Watch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Judicial Watch Obtains September 11 Pentagon Video |url=http://www.judicialwatch.org/5772.shtml |publisher=[[Judicial Watch]] |date=2006-05-16 |accessdate=2008-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some still images from the video had previously been released and publicly circulated, but this was the first official release of the full video of the crash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://archives.cnn.com/2002/US/03/07/gen.pentagon.pictures/ |title=Images show September 11 Pentagon crash |publisher=CNN |date=2002-03-08 |accessdate=2008-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A nearby [[Citgo]] service station also had security cameras installed, but a video released on September 15, 2006, did not show the crash because the camera was pointed away from the crash site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.judicialwatch.org/5965.shtml |title=CITGO Gas Station Cameras Near Pentagon Evidently Did Not Capture Attack |date=2006-09-15 |publisher=Judicial Watch |accessdate=2008-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Videotapes dispel conspiracy; Plane, not missile seen hitting Pentagon on 9/11 |work = The Washington Times |date=2006-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Doubletree]] Hotel, located nearby in [[Crystal City, Arlington, Virginia|Crystal City, Virginia]], also had a security camera video, and on December 4, 2006, the FBI released the video in response to a freedom of information lawsuit filed by Scott Bingham.  The footage is &quot;grainy and the focus is soft, but a rapidly growing tower of smoke is visible in the distance on the upper edge of the frame as the plane crashes into the building&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kwtx.com/home/headlines/4821121.html |title=FBI Releases New Footage of 9/11 Pentagon Attack |publisher=[[KWTX-TV]] |date=2006-12-04 |accessdate=2008-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Ambush-vc274vs11med.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Diagram of a [[Viet Cong]] ambush.]]
An '''ambush''' is a long-established [[military tactics|military tactic]], in which the aggressors (the ambushing force) use [[concealment]] to attack a passing enemy. Ambushers strike from concealed positions, such as among dense [[underbrush]] or behind [[hill]]tops. Ambushes have been used consistently throughout history, from [[ancient warfare|ancient]] to [[modern warfare]]. An [[ambush predator]] is an animal which uses similar tactics to capture prey, without the difficulty and wasted energy of a chase. Ambushes also afford a degree of security for the ambushers, making the concealed attack more desirable than an outright fight.

==History==
During ancient warfare, an ambush often might involve thousands of soldiers on a large scale, such as over a [[mountain pass]]. Ambushes appear many times in military history. One outstanding example from ancient times is the [[Battle of the Trebia]] river. Hannibal encamped within striking distance of the Romans with the Trebia River between them, and placed a strong force of cavalry and infantry in concealment, near the battle zone. He had noticed, says Polybius, a ''“place between the two camps, flat indeed and treeless, but well adapted for an ambuscade, as it was traversed by a water-course with steep banks, densely overgrown with brambles and other thorny plants, and here he proposed to lay a stratagem to surprise the enemy”''. When the Roman infantry became entangled in combat with his army, the hidden ambush force attacked the legionnaires in the rear. The result was slaughter and defeat for the Romans. Nevertheless the battle also displays the effects of good tactical discipline on the part of the ambushed force. Although most of the legions were lost, about 10,000 Romans cut their way through to safety, maintaining [[unit cohesion]]. This ability to maintain discipline and break out or maneuver away from a killing zone is a hallmark of good troops and training in any ambush situation. See Ranger reference below.

Another famous ambush was that sprung by Germanic warchief [[Arminius]] against the Romans at [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest]]. This particular ambush was to have an impact on the course of Western history. The Germanic forces demonstrated several principles needed for a successful ambush. They took cover in difficult forested terrain, allowing the warriors time and space to mass without detection. They had the element of surprise, and this was also aided by the defection of Arminius from Roman ranks prior to the battle. They sprung the attack when the Romans were most vulnerable- when they had left their fortified camp, and were on the march in a pounding rainstorm. They did not dawdle at the hour of decision but attacked quickly, using a massive series of short, rapid, vicious charges against the length of the whole Roman line, with charging units sometimes withdrawing to the forest to regroup while others took their place. The Germans also made use of blocking obstacles, erecting a trench and earthen wall to hinder Roman movement along the route of the killing zone. The result was mass slaughter of the Romans, and the destruction of 3 legions. The Germanic victory caused a limit on Roman expansion in the West. Ultimately, it established the Rhine as the boundary of the Roman Empire for the next four hundred years, until the decline of the Roman influence in the West. The Roman Empire made no further concerted attempts to conquer Germania beyond the Rhine.

The importance of such principles as the use of rugged terrain allowing cover and concealment, the element of surprise, and the quick assault/advance comes down to the present day, and is stressed in US Army Ranger doctrine concerning ambushes.

==Procedure==
In modern warfare, an ambush is most often employed by ground troops up to [[platoon]] size against enemy targets, which may be other ground troops, or possibly vehicles. However, in some situations, especially when deep behind enemy lines, the actual attack will be carried out by a platoon, a [[Company (military unit)|company]]-sized unit will be deployed to support the attack group, setting up and maintaining a forward patrol harbour from which the attacking force will deploy, and to which they will retire after the attack.

===Planning===
[[File:Ambush.gif|thumb|US Army idealised linear ambush plan]]
[[File:Ambush L shaped.gif|thumb|US Army idealised L-shaped ambush plan]]
Ambushes are complex, multi-phase operations, and are, therefore, usually planned in some detail. First, a suitable “'''killing zone'''” is identified.  This is the place where the ambush will be laid. It's generally a place where enemy units are expected to pass, and which gives reasonable cover for the deployment, execution, and extraction phases of the ambush patrol. A path along a wooded valley floor would be a typical example.

Ambush can be described geometrically as:
* '''Linear''', when a number of firing units are equally distant from the linear kill zone.
* '''L-shaped''', when a short leg of firing units are placed to [[enfilade]] the sides of the linear kill zone.
* '''V-shaped''', when the firing units are distant from the kill zone at the end where the enemy enters, so the firing units lay down bands of intersecting and interlocking fire. This ambush is normally triggered only when the enemy is well into the kill zone. The intersecting bands of fire prevent any attempt of moving out of the kill zone.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/policy/army/fm/7-85/ch6.htm FM 7-85 Chapter 6 Special Light Infantry Operations&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Preparation===
To be successful, an ambush patrol must deploy into the area covertly, ideally under the cover of darkness. The patrol will establish secure and covert positions overlooking the killing zone. Usually, two or more “cut-off” groups will be sent out a short distance from the main ambushing group, into similarly covert positions.  Their job is twofold; first, to give the ambush commander early warning of the approaching enemy, and second, when the ambush is initiated, to prevent any enemies from escaping. Another group will cover the front and rear of the ambush position (blocking force), and thus provide [[all round defence]].

Care must be taken by the ambush commander to ensure that fire from any weapon cannot inadvertently hit any other friendly unit (this is known as crossfire).

===Waiting===
Having set up the ambush, the next phase is to wait. This could be for a few hours, or a few days, depending on the tactical and supply situation. It is obviously much harder for an ambush patrol to remain covert and alert if sentry rosters, shelter, sleeping, sanitary arrangements, food and water, have to be considered; so this should be done in a patrol harbour, away from the site chosen for the ambush. Ambush patrols will almost always have to be self-sufficient, as re-supply would not be possible without compromising their position.

===Execution===
[[Image:Vcnvaattack2-med.jpg|thumb|right|Support elements needed for a successful large scale attack.]]

The arrival of an enemy in the area should be signalled by one of the cut-off units. This may be done by radio or by some other signal, but the enemy must not detect the signal. If [[radio silence]] is necessary, the pre-electronic expedient of a cord linking the groups, tugged once or twice as a signal, may be employed. The ambush commander will have given a clear instruction for initiating the ambush. An ambush is ideally initiated by the most effective casualty-producing device available to the attacking elements.  This might be a burst from an [[automatic weapon]], or the use of an antipersonnel explosive device (such as a [[M18A1 Claymore Antipersonnel Mine|Claymore mine]] or other directional weapon). Some military doctrines call for an ambush to be initiated by a signal from a whistle, though in US practice, whistles are not favored, since they do nothing to inflict damage on the enemy. The ambush commander may judge when the ambush will be most effective, and give the signal manually, or the ambush patrol may rely on tripwire or pressure-detonated mines in the kill zone to initiate firing.

Against vehicles, the lead and rear vehicles are the primary targets; this traps the remaining vehicles in the kill zone for as long as possible. Targets are prioritised to rapidly destroy the target's unit cohesion. It is vital to obtain fire superiority as rapidly as possible, to prevent enemy counter-ambush tactics from being executed. The order of priorities against an enemy infantry unit is the enemy radio operator (in the past identified by the whip aerial of the backpack radio unit such as the British Army's Clansman system), the enemy's unit commander (a more difficult task today when officers and NCOs are dressed and armed in an identical manner to the rest of the infantry squad), and the platoon or section machine-gunner. {{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

After the [[firefight]] has been won, the now compromised ambush patrol must leave the area as soon as it is practical to do so. In hit-and-run operations, especially against superior numbers and forces, the ambush force will begin disengaging even before the [[firefight]] has been won. {{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} In the past, accepted protocol was to check bodies for intelligence, take prisoners, and 'treat' any wounded enemy. Once this was accomplished, the ambush patrol would then exfiltrate the area by a pre-determined route.

If time has allowed for it, the ambush force will have prepared their exit; for example, placing [[land mine]]s to cover their retreat, with the members of the force making, and following, a safe route through the mines. If possible, a subsidiary ambush may be planned along the exit route to catch pursuing troops, and, if available, the egress may be covered by mortar or artillery fire.

===Surviving an ambush===
By definition, the ambush contains the element of total surprise; which means the victims of the ambush have no knowledge of how it has been constructed, or of what measures may have been employed to prevent escape. Therefore – and this has been proven by the experience of war – the only ''likely'' method of survival is withdrawal from the killing zone &quot;the way you came in&quot;. All other routes out of the killing zone may be blocked, and in a very well-planned and well-executed ambush, even the &quot;back door&quot; will have been closed by the time the ambush is sprung.  The published military doctrine is &quot;immediate, positive, and offensive action&quot;(ref: FM 55-30 USARMY, also PFN-T8M20024), but this is very likely to have been anticipated by the ones who set the ambush, and often plays into their hands. The value of withdrawal is the preservation of the force to &quot;live to fight another day&quot;, when not taken by surprise.

===Avoiding the ambush===
The best way to survive an ambush is not to encounter them. In order for this to happen, patrol movement mustn't be predictable in timing or route, and should avoid the most obvious routes. Rather than moving at a constant speed and direction, the patrol should vary these, with occasional stops to observe both the route ahead, and changes behind. Units should move in such a way that they are close enough together for mutual support, but far enough apart so that one burst of automatic fire wouldn't take out the entire unit. When on foot, if possible, the patrol should move in such a way as to maximise their firepower; for example, with the arrowhead and spearhead formation, they should not allow themselves to be skylined. Units on foot should have a point man some way ahead of the main body, and, if possible, a rearguard as well. Those travelling in vehicles follow the same procedures, with lead and trailing vehicles well ahead of, and well behind, the main body of vehicles.

===Countering an ambush===
In the modern day warfare, this is much easier than before, since a route can be sanitized beforehand by aerial assets, and any obvious ambush sites noted, and counter measures taken. During the [[Soviet war in Afghanistan]], [[Mi-24 Hind]]  gunships were used to locate concentrations of [[mujahideen]] guerrilla, and these would then be attacked by the Hinds themselves, or by artillery, using the aircraft as spotters.

      <text xml:space="preserve">An '''abzyme''' (from [[antibody]] and [[enzyme]]), also called ''catmab'' (from ''catalytic monoclonal antibody''), is a [[monoclonal antibody]] with [[catalytic activity]]. Molecules which are modified to gain new catalytic activity are called [[synzymes]]. Abzymes are usually artificial constructs, but are also found in normal humans (anti-vasoactive intestinal peptide autoantibodies) and in patients with [[autoimmune diseases]] such as systemic [[lupus erythematosus]], where they can bind to and hydrolyze [[DNA]]. Abzymes are potential tools in [[biotechnology]], e.g., to perform specific actions on DNA.

Enzymes function by lowering the activation energy of the transition state, thereby catalyzing the formation of an otherwise less-favorable molecular intermediate between reactants and products.   If an antibody is developed to a stable molecule that's similar to an unstable intermediate of another (potentially unrelated) reaction, the developed antibody will enzymatically bind to and stabilize the intermediate state, thus catalyzing the reaction. A new and unique type of enzyme is produced.

==HIV treatment==

In a June 2008 issue of the journal Autoimmunity Reviews,&lt;ref name=&quot;physorg&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.physorg.com/news135360794.html |title=UT pathologists believe they have pinpointed Achilles heel of HIV |format= |work=physorg.com |accessdate=2008-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; researchers S Planque, Sudhir Paul, Ph.D, and Yasuhiro Nishiyama, Ph.D of the University Of Texas Medical School at Houston announced that they have engineered an abzyme that degrades the superantigenic region of the [[gp120]] [[CD4]] binding site. This is the one part of the [[HIV]] [[virus]] outer coating that does not change, because it is the attachment point to [[T lymphocytes]], the key cell in cell-mediated immunity. Once infected by HIV, patients produce antibodies to the more changeable parts of the viral coat.  The antibodies are ineffective because of the virus' ability to change their coats rapidly. Because this protein gp120 is necessary for the HIV virus to attach, it does not change across different strains and is a point of vulnerability across the entire range of the HIV variant population. 

The abzyme does more than bind to the site, it actually destroys the site, rendering the HIV virus inert, and then can attach to other viruses. A single abzyme can destroy thousands of HIV viruses. Human clinical trials will be the next step in producing treatment and perhaps even preventative vaccines and [[microbicide]]

In [[evolutionary biology]], an '''adaptive radiation''' is the [[evolution]] of [[Ecology|ecological]] and [[phenotypic]] diversity within a rapidly multiplying [[Lineage (evolution)|lineage]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Schluter2000&quot;&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting with a recent single ancestor, this process results in the [[speciation]] and phenotypic adaptation of an array of species exhibiting different morphological and physiological traits with which they can exploit a range of divergent environments.
&lt;ref name=&quot;Schluter2000&quot; /&gt;

Adaptive radiation, a characteristic example of [[cladogenesis]], can be graphically illustrated as a &quot;bush&quot;, or [[clade]], of coexisting species (on the [[tree of life]]).

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Identification ==
Four features can be used to identify an adaptive radiation:&lt;ref name=&quot;Schluter2000&quot; /&gt;
# A common ancestry of component species: specifically a ''recent'' ancestry. Note that this is not the same as a [[monophyly]] in which ''all'' descendants of a common ancestor are included.
# A phenotype-environment correlation: a ''significant'' association between environments and the morphological and physiological traits used to exploit those environments.
# Trait utility: the performance or fitness advantages of trait values in their corresponding environments.
# Rapid speciation: presence of one or more ''bursts'' in the emergence of new species around the time that ecological and phenotypic divergence is underway.

== Causes ==
===Innovation===
The evolution of a novel feature may permit a clade to diversify by making new areas of morphospace accessible. A classic example is the evolution of a fourth cusp in the mammalian tooth. This trait permits a vast increase in the range of foodstuffs which can be fed on. Evolution of this character has thus increased the number of [[ecological niche]]s available to mammals. The trait arose a number of times in different groups during the [[Cenozoic]], and in each instance was immediately followed by an adaptive radiation.&lt;ref name=Jernvall1996&gt;{{cite |10.1126/science.274.5292.1489}}&lt;/ref&gt; Birds find other ways to provide for each other, i.e. the evolution of flight opened new avenues for evolution to explore, initiating an adaptive radiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | title = The Origin and Evolution of Birds
 | first = Alan | last = Feduccia | year = 1999
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Other examples include [[placental]] gestation (for [[eutheria]]n mammals), or [[Bipedalism|bipedal locomotion]] (in [[hominins]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Levin-21&quot; /&gt;

===Opportunity===
Adaptive radiations often occur as a result of an organism arising in an environment with unoccupied niches, such as a newly formed lake or isolated island chain. The colonizing population may diversify rapidly to take advantage of all possible niches.

In [[Lake Victoria]], an isolated lake which formed recently in the African rift valley, over 300 species of [[cichlid]] fish adaptively radiated from one parent species in just 15,000 years.

Adaptive radiations commonly follow [[mass extinction]]s: following an extinction, many niches are left vacant. A classic example of this is the replacement of the non-avian dinosaurs with mammals at the [[K-T extinction event|end of the Cretaceous]], and of [[brachiopod]]s by bivalves at the [[P-T extinction|Permo-Triassic boundary]].

'''Agarose [[gel electrophoresis]]''' is a method used in clinical chemistry to separate proteins by charge and or size (IEF agarose, essentially size independent) and in [[biochemistry]] and [[molecular biology]] to separate a mixed population of [[DNA]] and [[RNA]] fragments by length, to estimate the size of [[DNA]] and [[RNA]] fragments or to separate [[protein]]s by charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Kryndushkin DS, Alexandrov IM, Ter-Avanesyan MD, Kushnirov VV| title= Yeast [PSI+] prion aggregates are formed by small Sup35 polymers fragmented by Hsp104  |journal= Journal of Biological Chemistry |volume= 278 |issue= 49 |pages= 49636  |year=2003 |pmid= 14507919 |doi= 10.1074/jbc.M307996200}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nucleic acid molecules are separated by applying an [[electric field]] to move the negatively charged molecules through an [[agarose]] matrix. Shorter molecules move faster and migrate farther than longer ones because shorter molecules migrate more easily through the pores of the gel. This phenomenon is called sieving.&lt;ref&gt;Sambrook J, Russel DW (2001). Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press. Cold Spring Harbor, NY.&lt;/ref&gt; Proteins are separated by charge in agarose because the pores of the gel are too  large to sieve proteins.

==Applications==
*Estimation of the size of DNA molecules following restriction enzyme digestion, e.g. in [[restriction enzyme|restriction mapping]] of cloned DNA.
*Analysis of [[PCR]] products, e.g. in molecular [[Preimplantation genetic diagnosis|genetic diagnosis]] or [[genetic fingerprinting]]
*Separation of restricted genomic DNA prior to [[Southern blot|Southern transfer]], or of RNA prior to [[Northern Blot|Northern transfer]].

Agarose gels are easily cast and handled compared to other matrices and nucleic acids are not chemically altered during electrophoresis. Samples are also easily recovered. After the experiment is finished, the resulting gel can be stored in a plastic bag in a refrigerator.

There are limits to electrophoretic techniques. Since passing current through a gel causes heating, gels may melt during electrophoresis. Electrophoresis is performed in buffer solutions to reduce pH changes due to the electric field, which is important because the charge of DNA and RNA depends on pH, but running for too long can exhaust the buffering capacity of the solution. Further, different preparations of genetic material may not migrate consistently with each other, for morphological or other reasons.

==Factors affecting migration of nucleic acids== 
The most important factor is the length of the DNA molecule, smaller molecules travel faster, except in field inversion , where it is possible to have &quot;band inversion&quot; - large molecules travel faster then small molecules.. But [[Chemical structure|conformation]] of the DNA molecule, such as % single strand, supercoiling, etc, is also a factor. When analyzing molecules by size, it is most convenient to analyze only linear molecules to avoid this problem, eg DNA fragments from a [[restriction digest]], linear DNA [[PCR]] products, or RNAs. Agarose gel electrophoresis is widely used to resolve circular DNA with different supercoiling topology, and to resolve fragments that differ due to DNA synthesis (Fangman work).

DNA damage due to increased [[Cross-link|cross-linking]] will dose-dependently reduce electrophoretic DNA migration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1016/S0887-2333(00)00022-9 | author=Blasiak J, Trzeciak A, Malecka-Panas E, Drzewoski J, Wojewódzka M | title=In vitro genotoxicity of ethanol and acetaldehyde in human lymphocytes and the gastrointestinal tract mucosa cells | journal=Toxicology in Vitro | volume=14 | issue=4 | year=2000 | pages=287–295  | id= | pmid=10906435}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1093/mutage/gep008 | author=Lu Y, Morimoto K | title=Is habitual alcohol drinking associated with reduced electrophoretic DNA migration in peripheral blood leukocytes from ALDH2-deficient male Japanese? | journal=Mutagenesis  | volume=24 | issue=4 | year=2009 | pages=303–308  | url = http://mutage.oxfordjournals.org/content/24/4/303.long |id= | pmid=19286920}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Increasing the agarose concentration of a gel reduces the migration speed and enables separation of smaller DNA molecules. The higher the voltage, the faster the DNA moves. But voltage is limited by the fact that it heats the gel and ultimately causes it to melt. High voltages also decrease the resolution (above about 5 to 8 V/cm).

Conformations of a DNA [[plasmid]] that has not been cut with a [[restriction enzyme]] will move with different speeds (slowest to fastest: nicked or open circular, linear, or supercoiled plasmid).

==Visualization: ethidium bromide (EtBr) and dyes==
The most common dye used to make DNA or RNA bands visible for agarose gel electrophoresis is [[ethidium bromide]], usually abbreviated as EtBr. It fluoresces under UV light when intercalated into DNA (or RNA). By running DNA through an EtBr-treated gel and visualizing it with UV light, any band containing more than ~20&amp;nbsp;ng DNA becomes distinctly visible. EtBr is a known mutagen, and safer alternatives are available.

Even short exposure of nucleic acids to UV light causes significant damage to the sample.  UV damage to the sample will reduce the efficiency of subsequent manipulation of the sample, such as ligation and cloning.  If the DNA is to be used after separation on the agarose gel, it is best to avoid exposure to UV light by using a blue light excitation source such as the Xcitablue UV to blue light conversion screen from [[Bio-Rad]] or Dark Reader from Clare Chemicals.  A blue excitable stain is required, such as one of the SYBR Green or GelGreen stains. 

Blue light is also better for visualization since it is safer than UV (eye-protection is not such a critical requirement) and passes through transparent plastic and glass. This means that the staining will be brighter even if the excitation light goes through glass or plastic gel platforms. 

[[SYBR Green|SYBR Green I]] is another dsDNA stain, produced by [[Invitrogen]]. It is more expensive, but 25 times more sensitive, and possibly safer than EtBr, though there is no data addressing its mutagenicity or toxicity in humans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://probes.invitrogen.com/media/pis/mp07567.pdf SYBR Green I Nucleic Acid Gel Stain&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[SYBR Safe]] is a variant of SYBR Green that has been shown to have low enough levels of mutagenicity and toxicity to be deemed nonhazardous waste under U.S. Federal regulations.&lt;ref name=&quot;probes.invitrogen.com&quot;&gt;[http://probes.invitrogen.com/media/pis/mp33100.pdf SYBR Safe DNA Gel Stain&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; It has similar sensitivity levels to EtBr,&lt;ref name=&quot;probes.invitrogen.com&quot;/&gt; but, like SYBR Green, is significantly more expensive. In countries where safe disposal of hazardous waste is mandatory, the costs of EtBr disposal can easily outstrip the initial price difference, however.

Since EtBr stained DNA is not visible in natural light, scientists mix DNA with negatively charged '''loading buffers''' before adding the mixture to the gel. Loading buffers are useful because they are visible in natural light (as opposed to UV light for EtBr stained DNA), and they co-sediment with DNA (meaning they move at the same speed as DNA of a certain length). [[Xylene cyanol]] and [[Bromophenol blue]] are common dyes found in loading buffers; they run about the same speed as DNA fragments that are 5000 bp and 300 bp in length respectively, but the precise position varies with percentage of the gel. Other less frequently used progress markers are [[Cresol Red]] and [[Orange G]] which run at about 125 bp and 50 bp, respectively.

Visualization can also be achieved by transferring DNA to a nitrocellulose membrane followed by exposure to a [[hybridization probe]]. This process is termed [[Southern blot]]ting.

==Percent agarose and resolution limits==
Agarose gel electrophoresis can be used for the separation of DNA fragments ranging from 50 [[base pair]] to several megabases (millions of bases) using specialized apparatus. The distance between DNA bands of a given length is determined by the percent agarose in the gel. The disadvantage of higher concentrations is the long run times (sometimes days). Instead high percentage agarose gels should be run with a [[Pulsed field gel electrophoresis|pulsed field electrophoresis]] (PFE), or [[field inversion electrophoresis]]. 

Most agarose gels are made with between 0.7% (good separation or resolution of large 5–10kb DNA fragments) and 2% (good resolution for small 0.2–1kb fragments) agarose dissolved in electrophoresis buffer. Up to 3% can be used for separating very tiny fragments but a vertical [[polyacrylamide gel]] is more appropriate in this case. Low percentage gels are very weak and may break when you try to lift them. High percentage gels are often brittle and do not set evenly. 1% gels are common for many applications.

==Buffers==
There are a number of buffers used for agarose electrophoresis. The most common being, for nucleic acids [[TAE buffer|Tris/Acetate/EDTA]] (TAE), [[TBE buffer|Tris/Borate/EDTA]] (TBE). Many other buffers have been proposed eg,[[LB buffer|lithium borate]], which is almost never used, based on pubmed citatins (LB), iso electric histidine, pK matched goods buffers, etc; in most cases the purported rationale is lower current (less heat) and or matched ion mobilities, which leads to longer buffer life. Borate is problematic; Borate can polymerize, and/or interact with cis diols such as those found in RNA. TAE has the lowest buffering capacity but provides the best resolution for larger DNA. This means a lower voltage and more time, but a better product. LB is relatively new and is ineffective in resolving fragments larger than 5 kbp; However, with its low conductivity, a much higher voltage could be used (up to 35 V/cm), which means a shorter analysis time for routine electrophoresis. As low as one base pair size difference could be resolved in 3 % agarose gel with an extremely low conductivity medium (1 mM Lithium borate).&lt;ref&gt;Brody, J.R., Kern, S.E. (2004): History and principles of conductive media for standard DNA electrophoresis. ''Anal Biochem.'' 333(1):1-13. PMID 15351274 [http://www.cc.ahs.chula.ac.th/Molmed/DNA%20electro%27s%20conductive%20media.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis==
After electrophoresis the gel is illuminated with an [[ultraviolet]] lamp (usually by placing it on a light box, while using protective gear to limit exposure to ultraviolet radiation). The illuminator apparatus mostly also contains imaging apparatus that takes an image of the gel, after illumination with UV radiation. The [[ethidium bromide]] [[fluorescence|fluoresces]] reddish-orange in the presence of DNA, since it has intercalated with the DNA. The DNA band can also be cut out of the gel, and can then be dissolved to retrieve the purified DNA.
The gel can then be photographed usually with a digital or polaroid camera. Although the stained nucleic acid fluoresces reddish-orange, images are usually shown in black and white (see figures). 

Gel electrophoresis research often takes advantage of software-based image analysis tools, such as [[ImageJ]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{About|the forms of a gene|a non-technical introduction to the topic|Introduction to genetics|the alternative metal band|Allele (band)}}

An '''allele''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|uk|ˈ|æ|l|iː|l}} or {{IPAc-en|us|ə|ˈ|l|iː|l}}) is one of two or more forms of a  [[gene]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Collins&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Basic glossary on genetic epidemiology&quot;/&gt;  Sometimes, different alleles can result in different [[Phenotypic trait|traits]], such as color. Other times, different alleles will have the same result in the expression of a gene.

Most [[multicellular organism]]s have two sets of [[chromosome]]s, that is, they are [[diploid]].  These chromosomes are referred to as [[homologous chromosomes]]. Diploid organisms have one copy of each gene (and one allele) on each chromosome. If both alleles are the same, they are [[homozygote]]s. If the alleles are different, they are [[heterozygote]]s.

A [[population]] or [[species]] of organisms typically includes multiple alleles at each [[Locus (genetics)|locus]] among various individuals. Allelic variation at a locus is measurable as the number of alleles ([[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphism]]) present, or the proportion of heterozygotes in the population.

For example, at the gene locus for [[ABO]] [[blood type]] [[proteins]] in humans,&lt;ref name=&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;OnlineMendelianInheritanceinMan&quot;/&gt;    classical genetics recognizes three alleles, I&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt;, I&lt;sup&gt;B&lt;/sup&gt;, and I&lt;sup&gt;O&lt;/sup&gt;, that determines compatibility of [[blood transfusions]]. Any individual has one of six possible genotypes (AA, AO, BB, BO, AB, and OO) that produce one of four possible phenotypes: &quot;A&quot; (produced by AA homozygous and AO heterozygous genotypes), &quot;B&quot; (produced by BB homozygous and BO heterozygous genotypes), &quot;AB&quot; heterozygotes, and &quot;O&quot; homozygotes. It is now known that each of the A, B, and O alleles is actually a class of multiple alleles with different DNA sequences that produce proteins with identical properties: more than 70 alleles are known at the ABO locus.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sequence variation at the human ABO locus&quot;/&gt; An individual with &quot;Type A&quot; blood may be a AO heterozygote, an AA homozygote, or an A'A heterozygote with two different 'A' alleles.

The word &quot;allele&quot; is a short form of [[allelomorph]] ('other form'), which was used in the early days of [[genetics]] to describe variant forms of a [[gene]] detected as different [[phenotypes]]. It derives from the Greek word αλληλος, ''allelos'', meaning &quot;each other&quot;.

==Dominant and recessive alleles==
In many cases, genotypic interactions between the two alleles at a locus can be described as [[Dominance (genetics)|dominant]] or [[recessive]], according to which of the two homozygous genotypes the phenotype of the heterozygote most resembles. Where the heterozygote is indistinguishable from one of the homozygotes, the allele involved is said to be [[Dominance (genetics)|dominant]] to the other, which is said to be [[recessive]] to the former.&lt;ref name=&quot;Essential genetics: A genomics perspective&quot;/&gt; The degree and pattern of dominance varies among loci.  For a further discussion see [[Dominance (genetics)]].

The term &quot;[[wild type]]&quot; allele is sometimes used to describe an allele that is thought to contribute to the typical phenotypic character as seen in &quot;wild&quot; populations of organisms, such as fruit flies (''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]''). Such a &quot;wild type&quot; allele was historically regarded as dominant, common, and &quot;normal&quot;, in contrast to &quot;[[mutant]]&quot; alleles regarded as recessive, rare, and frequently deleterious. It was commonly thought that most individuals were homozygous for the &quot;wild type&quot; allele at most gene loci, and that any alternative 'mutant' allele was found in homozygous form in a small minority of &quot;affected&quot; individuals, often as [[genetic diseases]], and more frequently in heterozygous form in &quot;[[Genetic carrier|carriers]]&quot; for the mutant allele. It is now appreciated that most or all gene loci are highly polymorphic, with multiple alleles, whose frequencies vary from population to population, and that a great deal of genetic variation is hidden in the form of alleles that do not produce obvious phenotypic differences.

==Allele and genotype frequencies==
The frequency of alleles in a population can be used to predict the frequencies of the corresponding genotypes (see [[Hardy-Weinberg principle]]). For a simple model, with two alleles:

: &lt;math&gt;p + q=1 \, &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;p^2 + 2pq + q^2=1 \,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''p'' is the frequency of one allele and ''q'' is the frequency of the alternative allele, which necessarily sum to unity. Then, ''p''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is the fraction of the population homozygous for the first allele, 2''pq'' is the fraction of heterozygotes, and ''q''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is the fraction homozygous for the alternative allele. If the first allele is dominant to the second, then the fraction of the population that will show the dominant phenotype is ''p''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 2''pq'', and the fraction with the recessive phenotype is ''q''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

With three alleles:

: &lt;math&gt;p + q + r = 1 \, &lt;/math&gt; and

: &lt;math&gt;p^2 + 2pq + 2pr + q^2 + 2qr + r^2 = 1 \,&lt;/math&gt;

In the case of multiple alleles at a diploid locus, the number of possible genotypes (G) with a number of alleles (a) is given by the expression:

: &lt;math&gt;G= \frac{a(a+1)}{2} &lt;/math&gt;

==Allelic variation in genetic disorders==
A number of [[genetic disorders]] are caused when an individual inherits two recessive alleles for a single-gene trait. Recessive genetic disorders include [[Albinism]], [[Cystic Fibrosis]], [[Galactosemia]], [[Phenylketonuria]] (PKU), and [[Tay-Sachs Disease]]. Other disorders are also due to recessive alleles, but because the gene locus is located on the X chromosome, so that males have only one copy (that is, they are [[hemizygosity|hemizygous]]), they are more frequent in males than in females. Examples include red-green [[color blindness]] and [[Fragile X syndrome]].

Other disorders, such as [[Huntington disease]], occur when an individual inherits only one dominant allele.

'''Ampicillin''' is a [[beta-lactam antibiotic|beta-lactam]] [[antibiotic]] that has been used extensively to treat [[bacteria]]l [[infection]]s since 1961. Until the introduction of ampicillin by the British company [[Beecham (pharmaceutical company)|Beecham]], penicillin therapies had only been effective against [[Gram-positive]] organisms such as [[Staphylococcus|staphylococci]] and [[Streptococcus|streptococci]]. Ampicillin (originally branded as 'Penbritin') also demonstrated activity against [[Gram-negative]] organisms such as ''[[H. influenzae]]'', [[coliform]]s and ''[[Proteus]]'' spp. Ampicillin was the first of a number of so-called broad spectrum penicillins subsequently introduced by Beecham. Ampicillin is part of the [[aminopenicillin]] family and is roughly equivalent to its successor, [[amoxicillin]] in terms of spectrum and level of activity.&lt;ref name=AHFS&gt;{{ cite book | title= AHFS DRUG INFORMATION 2006 | publisher= American Society of Health-System Pharmacists | year= 2006 | edition= 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can sometimes result in reactions that range in severity from a [[rash]] (in the case of patients that may unwittingly have [[Infectious mononucleosis|mononucleosis]]) to potentially lethal [[allergic reaction]]s such as [[anaphylaxis]]. However, as with other penicillin drugs, it is relatively non-toxic and adverse effects of a serious nature are encountered only rarely.

==Mechanism of action==
Belonging to the [[penicillin]] group of beta-lactam antibiotics, ampicillin is able to penetrate [[Gram-positive]] and some [[Gram-negative]] bacteria. It differs from penicillin only by the presence of an [[amino]] group. That amino group helps the drug penetrate the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria.

Ampicillin acts as a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme [[DD-transpeptidase|transpeptidase]], which is needed by bacteria to make their [[cell wall]]s.&lt;ref name=AHFS/&gt; It inhibits the third and final stage of bacterial cell wall synthesis in [[binary fission]], which ultimately leads to cell [[lysis]]. Ampicillin has received FDA approval for its mechanism of action.

=== Effects on chloroplast division ===
Ampicillin, like other [[beta-lactam|β-lactam]] antibiotics, not only blocks the division of bacteria, but also the division of [[chloroplast]]s of the [[Glaucophyte]]s (called cyanelles) and chloroplasts of the moss ''[[Physcomitrella patens]]'', a [[bryophyte]]. In contrast, it has no effect on the [[plastid]]s of the higher developed [[vascular plant]] ''Lycopersicon esculentum L.'' ([[tomato]]).&lt;ref&gt;Britta Kasten und [[Ralf Reski]] (1997): [[beta-lactam|β-lactam]] antibiotics inhibit chloroplast division in a moss (Physcomitrella patens) but not in tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum). Journal of [[Plant Physiology]] 150, 137-140. [http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=2640663]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application==
Ampicillin is closely related to [[amoxicillin]], another type of penicillin, and both are used to treat [[urinary tract infections]], [[otitis media]], uncomplicated community-acquired [[pneumonia]], ''[[Haemophilus influenzae]]'', [[salmonellosis]] and ''[[Listeriosis|Listeria]]'' [[meningitis]]. It is used with [[flucloxacillin]] in the combination antibiotic [[co-fluampicil]] for [[Empirical|empiric]] treatment of [[cellulitis]]; providing cover against [[Group A streptococcal infection]] whilst the flucloxacillin acts against the ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' bacterium. Of concern is the number of bacteria that become [[antibiotic resistance|resistant]] to Ampicillin necessitating combination therapy or use of other [[antibiotics]].

All ''[[Pseudomonas]]'' and most strains of ''[[Klebsiella]]'' and ''[[Aerobacter]]'' are considered resistant.&lt;ref name=Mosby&gt;{{ cite book | title=Mosby's Drug Consult 2006 | publisher= Mosby, Inc. | year= 2006 | edition= 16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An ampicillin resistance gene (abbreviated ''bla'') is commonly used as a [[selectable marker]] in routine biotechnology. Due to concerns over [[horizontal gene transfer]] to pathogenic organisms in the wild, the [[European Food Safety Authority]] restricts use of this gene (among other resistance genes) in commercial genetically modified organisms. The enzyme responsible for degrading ampicillin is called [[beta-lactamase]], in reference to the beta-lactam structure of ampicillin and related drugs.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Antibiotic resistance''' is a type of [[drug resistance]] where a [[microorganism]] is able to survive exposure to an [[antibiotic]]. [[Gene]]s can be [[Horizontal gene transfer|transferred between bacteria in a horizontal]] fashion by [[bacterial conjugation|conjugation]], [[Transduction (genetics)|transduction]], or [[transformation (genetics)|transformation]]. Thus a gene for antibiotic resistance which had evolved via [[natural selection]] may be shared. Evolutionary stress such as exposure to antibiotics then selects for the antibiotic resistant trait. Many antibiotic resistance genes reside on [[plasmids]], facilitating their transfer. If a bacterium carries several resistance genes, it is called multiresistant or, informally, a '''superbug''' or '''super bacterium'''.

The primary cause of antibiotic resistance is genetic mutation in bacteria. The prevalence of antibiotic resistant bacteria is a result of antibiotic use both within medicine and veterinary medicine. The greater the duration of exposure the greater the risk of the development of resistance irrespective of the severity of the need for antibiotics. As resistance towards antibiotics becomes more common a greater need for alternative treatments arises. However despite a push for new antibiotic therapies there has been a continued decline in the number of newly approved drugs.&lt;ref&gt;The Journal of Antibiotics 63, 423-430 (August 2010) | doi:10.1038/ja.2010.62&lt;/ref&gt; Antibiotic resistance therefore poses a significant problem.

==Causes==
{{See also|Antibiotic misuse}}
The widespread use of antibiotics both inside and outside of medicine is playing a significant role in the emergence of resistant bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Goossens H, Ferech M, Vander Stichele R, Elseviers M |title=Outpatient antibiotic use in Europe and association with resistance: a cross-national database study |journal=Lancet |volume=365 |issue=9459 |pages=579–87 |year=2005 |pmid=15708101 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(05)17907-0 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Antibiotics are often used in rearing animals for food and this use among others leads to the creation of resistant strains of bacteria. In some countries antibiotics are sold over the counter without a prescription which also leads to the creation of resistant strains. In supposedly well-regulated human medicine the major problem of the emergence of resistant bacteria is due to misuse and overuse of antibiotics by doctors as well as patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs268/en/index.html |title=Use of antimicrobials outside human medicine and resultant antimicrobial resistance in humans |author=WHO |authorlink=World Health Organisation |publisher=World Health Organization |month=January |year=2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other practices contributing towards resistance include the addition of antibiotics to the feed of livestock.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.295.5552.27a | journal = Science | date = 4 January 2002 | volume = 295 | issue = 5552 | pages = 27–28 | author = Dan Ferber | pmid = 11778017 | title = Livestock Feed Ban Preserves Drugs' Power }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mathew&quot;/&gt; Household use of antibacterials in soaps and other products, although not clearly contributing to resistance, is also discouraged (as not being effective at infection control).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cdc.gov/getsmart/antibiotic-use/anitbiotic-resistance-faqs.html#j &quot;Are antibacterial-containing products (soaps, household cleaners, etc.) better for preventing the spread of infection? Does their use add to the problem of resistance?&quot;], ''Antibiotic Resistance Questions &amp; Answers'', Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia, USA. Retrieved November 17, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Also unsound practices in the pharmaceutical manufacturing industry can contribute towards the likelihood of creating antibiotic resistant strains.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Larsson | first1 = DG. | last2 = Fick | first2 = J. | title = Transparency throughout the production chain -- a way to reduce pollution from the manufacturing of pharmaceuticals? | journal = Regul Toxicol Pharmacol | month = Jan | year = 2009 | doi = 10.1016/j.yrtph.2009.01.008 | pmid = 19545507  | volume = 53  | page = 161  | issue = 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain antibiotic classes are highly associated with colonisation with superbugs compared to other antibiotic classes. The risk for colonisation increases if there is a lack of sensitivity (resistance) of the superbugs to the antibiotic used and high tissue penetration as well as broad spectrum activity against &quot;good bacteria&quot;. In the case of [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|MRSA]], increased rates of MRSA infections are seen with [[glycopeptides]], [[cephalosporin]]s and especially [[quinolones]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Tacconelli E, De Angelis G, Cataldo MA, Pozzi E, Cauda R |title=Does antibiotic exposure increase the risk of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolation?

===Role of other animals===
Drugs are used in animals that are used as human food, such as cows, pigs, chickens, fish, etc., and these drugs can affect the safety of the meat, milk, and eggs produced from those animals and can be the source of superbugs. For example, farm animals, particularly pigs, are believed to be able to infect people with MRSA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Drug Resistant Infections: Riding Piggyback |journal=The Economist |date= November 29, 2007 |url=http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=10205187&amp;amp;fsrc=RSS }}&lt;/ref&gt; The resistant bacteria in animals due to antibiotic exposure can be transmitted to humans via three pathways, those being through the consumption of meat, from close or direct contact with animals, or through the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= Schneider K, Garrett L |title= Non-therapeutic Use of Antibiotics in Animal Agriculture, Corresponding Resistance Rates, and What Can be Done About It |url= http://www.cgdev.org/content/article/detail/1422307/ |date= June 19, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The World Health Organization concluded that antibiotics as growth promoters in animal feeds should be prohibited (in the absence of risk assessments). In 1998, European Union health ministers voted to ban four antibiotics widely used to promote animal growth (despite their scientific panel's recommendations). Regulation banning the use of antibiotics in European feed, with the exception of two antibiotics in poultry feeds, became effective in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Castanon J.I. | year = 2007 | title = History of the use of antibiotic as growth promoters in European poultry feeds | journal = Poult.

In 2001, the Union of Concerned Scientists estimated that greater than 70% of the antibiotics used in the US are given to food animals (for example, chickens, pigs and cattle) in the absence of disease.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucsusa.org/food_and_environment/antibiotics_and_food/hogging-it-estimates-of-antimicrobial-abuse-in-livestock.html Executive summary from the UCS report &quot;Hogging It: Estimates of Antimicrobial Abuse in Livestock&quot;, January 2001]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000 the [[US Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) announced their intention to revoke approval of [[fluoroquinolone]] use in poultry production because of substantial evidence linking it to the emergence of fluoroquinolone resistant [[campylobacter]] infections in humans. The final decision to ban fluoroquinolones from use in poultry production was not made until five years later because of challenges from the food animal and pharmaceutical industries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nelson-2007&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Nelson | first1 = JM. | last2 = Chiller | first2 = TM. | last3 = Powers | first3 = JH. | last4 = Angulo | first4 = FJ. | title = Fluoroquinolone-resistant Campylobacter species and the withdrawal of fluoroquinolones from use in poultry: a public health success story. | journal = Clin Infect Dis | volume = 44 | issue = 7 | pages = 977–80 | month = Apr | year = 2007 | doi = 10.1086/512369 | pmid = 17342653 |url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/pdf/10.1086/512369 |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, there are two federal bills (S. 549&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=s110-549 US Senate Bill S. 549: Preservation of Antibiotics for Medical Treatment Act of 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; and H.R. 962&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h110-962 US House Bill H.R. 962: Preservation of Antibiotics for Medical Treatment Act of 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;) aimed at phasing out &quot;non-therapeutic&quot; antibiotics in US food animal production.

[[Image:mecA Resistance.svg|thumb|right|Diagram depicting antibiotic resistance through alteration of the antibiotic's target site, modeled after MRSA's resistance to penicillin. Beta-lactam antibiotics permanently inactivate [[Penicillin binding protein|PBP enzymes]], which are essential for bacterial life, by permanently binding to their active sites. [[MRSA]], however, expresses a PBP that will not allow the antibiotic into its active site.]]
Antibiotic resistance can be a result of [[horizontal gene transfer]],&lt;ref&gt;Ochiai, K., Yamanaka, T Kimura K and Sawada, O (1959) Inheritance of drug resistance (and its transfer) between Shigella strains and Between Shigella and E.coli strains. Hihon Iji Shimpor 1861: 34 (in Japanese) 
&lt;/ref&gt; and also of unlinked point mutations in the [[pathogen]] [[genome]] at a rate of about 1 in 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; per chromosomal replication. The antibiotic action against the pathogen can be seen as an environmental pressure; those bacteria which have a mutation allowing them to survive will live on to reproduce. They will then pass this trait to their offspring, which will result in a fully resistant colony.

The four main mechanisms by which microorganisms exhibit resistance to antimicrobials are: 
# Drug inactivation or modification: for example, enzymatic deactivation of [[Penicillin|''Penicillin'' G]] in some penicillin-resistant bacteria through the production of [[Beta-lactamases|β-lactamases]].
# Alteration of target site: for example, alteration of [[Penicillin binding protein|PBP]]—the binding target site of penicillins—in [[MRSA]] and other penicillin-resistant bacteria.
# Alteration of metabolic pathway: for example, some [[sulfa drugs|sulfonamide]]-resistant bacteria do not require [[para-aminobenzoic acid]] (PABA), an important precursor for the synthesis of [[folic acid]] and [[nucleic acids]] in bacteria inhibited by sulfonamides. Instead, like mammalian cells, they turn to utilizing preformed folic acid.
# Reduced drug accumulation: by decreasing drug [[Semipermeable membrane|permeability]] and/or increasing active [[efflux]] (pumping out) of the drugs across the cell surface.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid19678712&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author= Li, X, Nikadio H |title = Efflux-mediated drug resistance in bacteria: an update.| journal = Drug | volume = 69 | issue = 12 | pages = 1555–623| year = 2009 | pmid = 19678712 |  doi = 10.2165/11317030-000000000-00000| url = | issn = |pmc= 2847397 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three known mechanisms of [[fluoroquinolone]] resistance. Some types of [[Efflux (microbiology)|efflux]] pumps can act to decrease intracellular [[quinolone]] concentration.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid9661020&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Morita Y, Kodama K, Shiota S, Mine T, Kataoka A, Mizushima T, Tsuchiya T | title = NorM, a putative multidrug efflux protein, of Vibrio parahaemolyticus and its homolog in Escherichia coli | journal = Antimicrob.

Antibiotic resistance can also be introduced artificially into a microorganism through laboratory protocols, sometimes used as a [[selectable marker]] to examine the mechanisms of gene transfer or to identify individuals that absorbed a piece of DNA that included the resistance gene and another gene of interest.

==Resistant pathogens==
=== ''Staphylococcus aureus''===
{{Main|MRSA}}
''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' (colloquially known as &quot;Staph aureus&quot; or a ''Staph infection'') is one of the major resistant pathogens. Found on the [[mucous membranes]] and the [[human skin]] of around a third of the population, it is extremely adaptable to antibiotic pressure. It was one of the earlier bacteria in which [[penicillin]] resistance was found—in 1947, just four years after the drug started being mass-produced. [[Methicillin]] was then the antibiotic of choice, but has since been replaced by [[oxacillin]] due to significant kidney toxicity. MRSA ([[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'']]) was first detected in Britain in 1961 and is now &quot;quite common&quot; in hospitals. MRSA was responsible for 37% of fatal cases of [[sepsis]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] in 1999, up from 4% in 1991. Half of all ''S. aureus'' infections in the [[United States|US]] are resistant to penicillin, methicillin, [[tetracycline]] and [[erythromycin]].

This left [[vancomycin]] as the only effective agent available at the time. However, strains with intermediate (4-8&amp;nbsp;μg/ml) levels of resistance, termed GISA (glycopeptide intermediate ''Staphylococcus aureus'') or VISA (vancomycin intermediate ''Staphylococcus aureus''), began appearing in the late 1990s. The first identified case was in Japan in 1996, and strains have since been found in hospitals in England, France and the US. The first documented strain with complete (&gt;16&amp;nbsp;μg/ml) resistance to vancomycin, termed VRSA ([[Vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|Vancomycin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'']]) appeared in the United States in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite pmid|14563898}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''new'' class of antibiotics, [[Linezolid|oxazolidinones]], became available in the 1990s, and the first commercially available oxazolidinone, [[linezolid]], is comparable to vancomycin in effectiveness against MRSA. Linezolid-resistance in ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' was reported in 2003.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

CA-MRSA (Community-acquired MRSA) has now emerged as an epidemic that is responsible for rapidly progressive, fatal diseases including necrotizing pneumonia, severe [[sepsis]] and [[necrotizing fasciitis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17146447&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Boyle-Vavra S, Daum RS |title=Community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus: the role of Panton-Valentine leukocidin |journal=Lab.

The [[epidemiology]] of infections caused by MRSA is rapidly changing. In the past 10 years, infections caused by this organism have emerged in the community. The 2 MRSA clones in the United States most closely associated with community outbreaks, [[USA400]] (MW2 strain, ST1 lineage) and [[USA300]], often contain [[Panton-Valentine leukocidin]] (PVL) genes and, more frequently, have been associated with skin and soft tissue infections. Outbreaks of community-associated (CA)-MRSA infections have been reported in correctional facilities, among athletic teams, among military recruits, in newborn nurseries, and among [[men who have sex with men]]. CA-MRSA infections now appear to be endemic in many urban regions and cause most CA-S. aureus infections.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17479885&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Maree CL, Daum RS, Boyle-Vavra S, Matayoshi K, Miller LG |title=Community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolates causing healthcare-associated infections |journal=Emerging Infect.

===''Streptococcus'' and ''Enterococcus''===

''[[Streptococcus pyogenes]]'' (Group A Streptococcus: GAS) infections can usually be treated with many different antibiotics. Early treatment may reduce the risk of death from invasive group A streptococcal disease. However, even the best medical care does not prevent death in every case. For those with very severe illness, supportive care in an intensive care unit may be needed. For persons with necrotizing fasciitis, surgery often is needed to remove damaged tissue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Division of Bacterial and Mycotic Diseases |title=Group A Streptococcal (GAS) Disease (strep throat, necrotizing fasciitis, impetigo) -- Frequently Asked Questions |url=http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dbmd/diseaseinfo/groupastreptococcal_g.htm |date=2005-10-11 |publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |accessdate=2007-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Strains of ''S. pyogenes'' resistant to [[macrolide]] antibiotics have emerged, however all strains remain uniformly sensitive to [[penicillin]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15109426&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Albrich WC, Monnet DL, Harbarth S |title=Antibiotic selection pressure and resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes |journal=Emerging Infect.

Resistance of ''[[Streptococcus pneumoniae]]'' to penicillin and other beta-lactams is increasing worldwide. The major mechanism of resistance involves the introduction of mutations in genes encoding penicillin-binding proteins. Selective pressure is thought to play an important role, and use of beta-lactam antibiotics has been implicated as a risk factor for infection and colonization. Streptococcus pneumoniae is responsible for [[pneumonia]], [[bacteremia]], [[otitis media]], [[meningitis]], [[sinusitis]], [[peritonitis]] and [[arthritis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15109426&quot;/&gt;

Penicillin-resistant [[pneumonia]] caused by ''[[Streptococcus pneumoniae]]'' (commonly known as ''pneumococcus''), was first detected in 1967, as was penicillin-resistant [[gonorrhea]]. Resistance to penicillin substitutes is also known as beyond ''S. aureus''. By 1993 ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' was resistant to five [[quinolones|fluoroquinolone]] variants. ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]'' is commonly resistant to [[isoniazid]] and [[rifampin]] and sometimes universally resistant to the common treatments. Other pathogens showing some resistance include ''[[Salmonella]]'', ''[[Campylobacter]]'', and ''[[Streptococci]]''.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

===''Pseudomonas aeruginosa''===

''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'' is a highly prevalent [[opportunistic pathogen]]. One of the most worrisome characteristics of ''[[P. aeruginosa]]'' consists in its low [[antibiotic]] susceptibility. This low susceptibility is attributable to a concerted action of [[efflux (microbiology)|multidrug efflux pumps]] with chromosomally-encoded antibiotic resistance genes (for example, ''mexAB-oprM'', ''mexXY'' etc.) and the low permeability of the bacterial cellular envelopes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Poole2004&quot;&gt;{{Cite pmid|14706082}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides intrinsic resistance, ''P. aeruginosa'' easily develop acquired resistance either by [[mutation]] in chromosomally-encoded genes, or by the horizontal gene transfer of antibiotic resistance determinants. Development of [[multidrug resistance]] by ''P. aeruginosa'' isolates requires several different genetic events that include acquisition of different mutations and/or horizontal transfer of antibiotic resistance genes. Hypermutation favours the selection of mutation-driven antibiotic resistance in ''P. aeruginosa'' strains producing chronic infections, whereas the clustering of several different antibiotic resistance genes in [[integron]]s favours the concerted acquisition of antibiotic resistance determinants. Some recent studies have shown that phenotypic resistance associated to [[biofilm]] formation or to the emergence of small-colony-variants may be important in the response of ''P. aeruginosa'' populations to [[antibiotic]]s treatment.&lt;ref name=Cornelis&gt;{{cite book | author = Cornelis P (editor). | title = Pseudomonas: Genomics and Molecular Biology | edition = 1st | publisher = Caister Academic Press | year = 2008 | url=http://www.horizonpress.com/pseudo | isbn=978-1-904455-19-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Salmonella'' and ''E. coli''===
''[[Escherichia coli]]'' and ''[[Salmonella]]'' come directly from contaminated food.  Of the meat that is contaminated with ''E. coli'', eighty percent of the bacteria are resistant to one or more drugs made; it causes bladder infections that are resistant to antibiotics (“HSUS Fact Sheet”). ''Salmonella'' was first found in humans in the 1970s and in some cases is resistant to as many as nine different antibiotics (“HSUS Fact Sheet”). When both bacterium are spread, serious health conditions arise. Many people are hospitalized each year after becoming infected, and some die as a result.

[[Vaccine]]s do not suffer the problem of resistance because a vaccine enhances the body's natural defenses, while an antibiotic operates separately from the body's normal defenses. Nevertheless, new strains may [[Evolution|evolve]] that escape immunity induced by vaccines; for example an update [[Influenza vaccine]] is needed each year.

While theoretically promising, anti-staphylococcal vaccines have shown limited efficacy, because of immunological variation between ''Staphylococcus'' species, and the limited duration of effectiveness of the antibodies produced. Development and testing of more effective vaccines is under way.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

The Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization ([[CSIRO]]), realizing the need for the reduction of antibiotic use, has been working on two alternatives. One alternative is to prevent diseases by adding [[cytokine]]s instead of antibiotics to animal feed. {{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} These proteins are made in the animal body &quot;naturally&quot; after a disease and are not antibiotics so they do not contribute to the antibiotic resistance problem. Furthermore, studies on using cytokines have shown that they also enhance the growth of animals like the antibiotics now used, but without the drawbacks of non-therapeutic antibiotic use. Cytokines have the potential to achieve the animal growth rates traditionally sought by the use of antibiotics without the contribution of antibiotic resistance associated with the widespread non-therapeutic uses of antibiotics currently utilized in the food animal production industries. Additionally, CSIRO is working on vaccines for diseases.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

===Phage therapy===
[[Phage therapy]], an approach that has been extensively researched and utilized as a therapeutic agent for over 60 years, especially in the [[Soviet Union]], is an alternative that might help with the problem of resistance. Phage therapy was widely used in the United States until the discovery of antibiotics, in the early 1940s. Bacteriophages or &quot;phages&quot; are viruses that invade bacterial cells and, in the case of lytic phages, disrupt bacterial metabolism and cause the bacterium to [[lysis|lyse]]. Phage therapy is the therapeutic use of lytic [[bacteriophages]] to treat [[pathogenic]] bacterial infections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Bacteriophage therapy is an important alternative to antibiotics in the current era of multidrug resistant pathogens. A review of studies that dealt with the therapeutic use of phages from 1966–1996 and few latest ongoing phage therapy projects via internet showed: phages were used topically, orally or systemically in Polish and Soviet studies. The success rate found in these studies was 80–95% with few gastrointestinal or allergic side effects. British studies also demonstrated significant efficacy of phages against ''[[Escherichia coli]]'', ''[[Acinetobacter]]'' spp., ''[[Pseudomonas]]'' spp and ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]''. US studies dealt with improving the bioavailability of phage. Phage therapy may prove as an important alternative to antibiotics for treating multidrug resistant pathogens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title= Bacteriophage therapy: an alternative to conventional antibiotics | author=Mathur MD, Vidhani S, Mehndiratta PL.| journal=J Assoc Physicians India | year=2003 | volume=51 | pages=593–6 | doi= 10.1258/095646202760159701 | pmid= 12194741 | issue= 8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=McGrath&gt;{{cite book | author = Mc Grath S and van Sinderen D (editors). | title = Bacteriophage: Genetics and Molecular Biology  | edition = 1st | publisher = Caister Academic Press | year = 2007 | url=http://www.horizonpress.com/phage | id = [http://www.horizonpress.com/phage ISBN 978-1-904455-14-1 ]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
===New medications===
Until recently, [[research and development]] (R&amp;D) efforts have provided new drugs in time to treat bacteria that became resistant to older antibiotics. That is no longer the case.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} The potential crisis at hand is the result of a marked decrease in industry R&amp;D, and the increasing prevalence of resistant bacteria. Infectious disease physicians are alarmed by the prospect that effective antibiotics may not be available to treat seriously ill patients in the near future.

As bacterial antibiotic resistance continues to exhaust our supply of effective antibiotics, a global public health disaster appears likely. Poor financial investment in antibiotic research has exacerbated the situation. A call to arms raised by several prestigious scientific organisations a few years ago rallied the scientific community, and now the scope of antibacterial research has broadened considerably.&lt;ref name= MillerAAMillerPF&gt;{{cite book | author= Miller, AA; Miller, PF (editor) | year=2011 | title=Emerging Trends in Antibacterial Discovery: Answering the Call to Arms | publisher=[[Caister Academic Press]] | isbn= 978-1-904455-89-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pipeline of new antibiotics is drying up. {{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}Major [[list of pharmaceutical companies|pharmaceutical companies]] are losing interest in the antibiotics market because these drugs may not be as profitable as drugs that treat chronic (long-term) conditions and lifestyle issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bad Bugs, No Drugs Executive Summary |url=http://www.idsociety.org/PrintFriendly.aspx?id=5558 |date= |publisher=Infectious Diseases Society of America |accessdate=2007-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The resistance problem demands that a renewed effort be made to seek antibacterial agents effective against pathogenic bacteria resistant to current antibiotics. One of the possible strategies towards this objective is the rational localization of [[bioactive]] [[phytochemical]]s.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Plants have an almost limitless ability to synthesize [[aromatic]] substances, most of which are [[phenol]]s or their oxygen-substituted derivatives such as [[tannin]]s. Most are secondary [[metabolite]]s, of which at least 12,000 have been isolated, a number estimated to be less than 10% of the total{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}. In many cases, these substances serve as plant defense mechanisms against [[predation]] by [[microorganism]]s, [[insect]]s, and [[herbivore]]s. Many of the herbs and spices used by humans to season food yield useful medicinal compounds including those having antibacterial activity.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15831135&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wallace RJ |title=Antimicrobial properties of plant secondary metabolites |journal=Proc Nutr Soc |volume=63 |issue=4 |pages=621–9 |year=2004 |pmid=15831135 |doi=10.1079/PNS2004393}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12872531&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Thuille N, Fille M, Nagl M |title=Bactericidal activity of herbal extracts |journal=Int J Hyg Environ Health |volume=206 |issue=3 |pages=217–21 |year=2003 |pmid=12872531 |doi=10.1078/1438-4639-00217}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12410554&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Singh G, Kapoor IP, Pandey SK, Singh UK, Singh RK |title=Studies on essential oils: part 10; antibacterial activity of volatile oils of some spices |journal=Phytother Res |volume=16 |issue=7 |pages=680–2 |year=2002 |pmid=12410554 |doi=10.1002/ptr.951}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional healers have long used plants to prevent or cure infectious conditions. Many of these plants have been investigated scientifically for antimicrobial activity and a large number of plant products have been shown to inhibit growth of pathogenic bacteria. {{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}A number of these agents appear to have structures and modes of action that are distinct from those of the antibiotics in current use, suggesting that [[cross-resistance]] with agents already in use may be minimal. For example the combination of [[5'-methoxyhydnocarpine]] and [[berberine]] in herbs like [[Hydrastis canadensis]] and [[Berberis vulgaris]] can block the MDR-pumps that cause multidrug resistance. This has been shown for [[Staphylococcus aureus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid10677479&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Stermitz FR, Lorenz P, Tawara JN, Zenewicz LA, Lewis K |title=Synergy in a medicinal plant: antimicrobial action of berberine potentiated by 5'-methoxyhydnocarpin, a multidrug pump inhibitor |journal=Proc.

[[Archaeocin]]s is the name given to a new class of potentially useful antibiotics that are derived from the [[Archaea]] group of organisms. Eight archaeocins have been partially or fully characterized, but hundreds of archaeocins are believed to exist, especially within the [[Archaea|haloarchaea]]. The prevalence of archaeocins is unknown simply because no one has looked for them. The discovery of new archaeocins hinges on recovery and cultivation of archaeal organisms from the environment. For example, samples from a novel hypersaline field site, Wilson Hot Springs, recovered 350 halophilic organisms; preliminary analysis of 75 isolates showed that 48 were archaeal and 27 were bacterial.&lt;ref name=Shand&gt;{{cite book |chapterurl=http://www.horizonpress.com/arch|author= Shand RF; Leyva KJ |year=2008|chapter=Archaeal Antimicrobials: An Undiscovered Country|title=Archaea: New Models for Prokaryotic Biology|publisher=Caister Academic Press|id=[http://www.horizonpress.com/arch ISBN 978-1-904455-27-1]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In research published on October 17, 2008 in [[Cell (journal)|''Cell'']], a team of scientists pinpointed the place on bacteria where the antibiotic [[myxopyronin]] launches its attack, and why that attack is successful. The myxopyronin binds to and inhibits the crucial bacterial enzyme, [[RNA polymerase]]. The myxopyronin changes the structure of the switch-2 segment of the enzyme, inhibiting its function of reading and transmitting DNA code. This prevents RNA polymerase from delivering genetic information to the [[ribosomes]], causing the bacteria to die.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mukhopadhyay J, Das K, Ismail S, Koppstein D, Jang M, Hudson B, Sarafianos S, Tuske S, Patel J, Jansen R, Irschik H, Arnold E, Ebright RH.|title=The RNA polymerase “switch region” is a target for inhibitors. |doi=10.1016/j.cell.2008.09.033 |journal=Cell |date=2008-10-17 |volume=135 |pages=295–307 |pmid=18957204 |issue=2 |pmc=2580802}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the major causes of antibiotic resistance is the decrease of effective drug concentrations at their target place, due to the increased action of [[ABC transporters]]. Since ABC transporter blockers can be used in combination with current drugs to increase their effective intracellular concentration, the possible impact of ABC transporter inhibitors is of great clinical interest. ABC transporter blockers that may be useful to increase the efficacy of current drugs have entered clinical trials and are available to be used in therapeutic regimes.&lt;ref name= Ponte-SucreA&gt;{{cite book |author= Ponte-Sucre, A (editor)| year=2009 |title=ABC Transporters in Microorganisms | publisher=Caister Academic Press | isbn= 978-1-904455-49-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Applications===

Antibiotic resistance is an important tool for [[genetic engineering]]. By constructing a [[plasmid]] which contains an antibiotic resistance gene as well as the gene being engineered or expressed, a researcher can ensure that when bacteria replicate, only the copies which carry along the plasmid survive. This ensures that the gene being manipulated passes along when the bacteria replicates.

The most commonly used antibiotics in genetic engineering are generally &quot;older&quot; antibiotics which have largely fallen out of use in clinical practice. These include:

* [[ampicillin]]
* [[kanamycin]]
* [[tetracycline]]
* [[chloramphenicol]]

Industrially the use of antibiotic resistance is disfavored since maintaining bacterial cultures would require feeding them large quantities of antibiotics. Instead, the use of [[auxotrophic]] bacterial strains (and function-replacement plasmids) is preferred.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Antibody.svg|thumb|255px|Each antibody binds to a specific antigen; an interaction similar to a lock and key.]]
An '''antigen''' is a substance/molecule that, when introduced into the body, triggers the production of an [[antibody]] by the [[immune system]], which will then kill or neutralize the antigen that is recognized as a foreign and potentially harmful invader. These invaders can be molecules such as pollen or cells such as bacteria. The term originally came from '''anti'''body '''gen'''erator&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newton.dep.anl.gov/askasci/mole00/mole00381.htm Antibody generator term]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Guyton and Hall (2006). Textbook of Medical Physiology, 11th edition. Page 440.  Elsevier, Inc. Philadelphia, PA.&lt;/ref&gt; and was a molecule that binds specifically to an antibody, but the term now also refers to any molecule or molecular fragment that can be bound by a [[major histocompatibility complex]] (MHC) and presented to a T-cell receptor.&lt;ref&gt;Parham, Peter. (2009). The Immune System, 3rd Edition, pg. G:2, Garland Science, Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Self&quot; antigens are usually tolerated by the immune system; whereas &quot;Non-self&quot; antigens are identified as intruders and attacked by the immune system. [[Autoimmune]] disorders arise from the immune system reacting to its own antigens.

In similar manner, an '''immunogen''' is a specific type of antigen.  An immunogen is defined as a substance that is able to provoke an adaptive immune response if injected on its own.&lt;ref&gt;Parham, Peter. (2009). The Immune System, 3rd Edition, pg. G:11, Garland Science, Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.&lt;/ref&gt;  Stated another way, an immunogen is able to induce an immune response, whereas an antigen is able to combine with the products of an immune response once they are made.  The overlapping concepts of '''immunogenicity''' and '''antigenicity''' are, therefore, subtly different. According to a current text book:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Immunogenicity is the ability to induce a humoral and/or cell-mediated immune response&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Antigenicity is the ability to combine specifically with the final products of the [[immune response]] (i.e. secreted antibodies and/or surface receptors on T-cells). Although all molecules that have the property of immunogenicity also have the property of antigenicity, the reverse is not true.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Kuby Immunology&quot; 6th edition, Macmillan, 2006, pg. 77 ISBN 1429202114, 9781429202114&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At the molecular level, an antigen is characterized by its ability to be &quot;bound&quot; at the [[Antibody#CDRs.2C_Fv.2C_Fab_and_Fc_Regions|antigen-binding site]] of an antibody. Note also that antibodies tend to discriminate between the specific [[epitope|molecular structures]] presented on the surface of the antigen (as illustrated in the Figure). Antigens are usually [[protein]]s or [[polysaccharide]]s. This includes parts (coats, capsules, cell walls, flagella, fimbrae, and toxins) of [[bacteria]], [[virus]]es, and other [[microorganism]]s. [[Lipid]]s and [[nucleic acid]]s are antigenic only when combined with proteins and polysaccharides. Non-microbial exogenous (non-self) antigens can include pollen, egg white, and proteins from transplanted tissues and organs or on the surface of transfused blood cells. [[Vaccine]]s are examples of immunogenic antigens intentionally administered to induce [[adaptive immune system|acquired immunity]] in the recipient.

Cells present their immunogenic-antigens to the immune system via a [[histocompatibility molecule]]. Depending on the antigen presented and the type of the histocompatibility molecule, several types of [[immune cell]]s can become activated.

==Related concepts==
*'''[[Epitope]]''' - The distinct molecular surface features of an antigen capable of being bound by an antibody (a.k.a. ''antigenic determinant''). Antigenic molecules, normally being &quot;large&quot; biological polymers, usually present several surface features that can act as points of interaction for specific antibodies. Any such distinct molecular feature constitutes an epitope. Therefore, most antigens have the potential to be bound by several distinct antibodies, each of which is specific to a particular epitope. Using the &quot;lock and key&quot; metaphor, the antigen itself can be seen as a string of keys - any epitope being a &quot;key&quot; - each of which can match a different lock. Different antibody '''[[idiotypes]]''', each having distinctly formed [[complementarity determining region]]s, correspond to the various &quot;locks&quot; that can match &quot;the keys&quot; (epitopes) presented on the antigen molecule.

*'''[[Allergen]]''' - A substance capable of causing an [[allergic reaction]]. The (detrimental) reaction may result after exposure via ingestion, inhalation, injection, or contact with skin.
*'''[[Superantigen]]''' - A class of antigens that cause non-specific activation of T-cells, resulting in polyclonal T cell activation and massive cytokine release.
*'''[[Tolerogen]]''' - A substance that invokes a specific immune non-responsiveness due to its [[molecular form]]. If its molecular form is changed, a tolerogen can become an immunogen.
*'''[[Immunoglobulin]] binding protein''' - These proteins are capable of binding to antibodies at positions outside of the antigen-binding site. That is, whereas antigens are the &quot;target&quot; of antibodies, immunoglobulin-binding proteins &quot;attack&quot; antibodies. [[Protein A]], [[protein G]], and [[protein L]] are examples of proteins that strongly bind to various antibody [[Isotype (immunology)|isotypes]].

==Origin of the term antigen==
In 1899, [[László Detre (physician)|Ladislas Deutsch (Laszlo Detre)]] (1874–1939) named the hypothetical substances halfway between bacterial constituents and antibodies &quot;substances immunogenes ou antigenes&quot;. He originally believed those substances to be precursors of antibodies, just like [[zymogen]] is a precursor of an enzyme. But, by 1903, he understood that an antigen induces the production of immune bodies (antibodies) and wrote that the word antigen is a contraction of &quot;Antisomatogen = Immunkörperbildner&quot;. The Oxford English Dictionary indicates that the logical construction should be &quot;anti(body)-gen&quot;.&lt;ref name=Lindenmann&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lindenmann, Jean  |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/119531625/PDFSTART |title=Origin of the Terms 'Antibody' and 'Antigen' |journal=Scand.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin of antigens==
Antigens can be classified in order of their class.

===Exogenous antigens===
Exogenous antigens are antigens that have entered the body from the outside, for example by [[inhalation]], [[ingestion]], or [[Injection (medicine)|injection]]. The immune system's response to exogenous antigens is often subclinical. By [[endocytosis]] or [[phagocytosis]], exogenous antigens are taken into the [[antigen-presenting cell]]s (APCs) and processed into fragments. APCs then present the fragments to [[T helper cells]] ([[CD4]]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) by the use of [[MHC class II|class II histocompatibility]] molecules on their surface. Some T cells are specific for the peptide:MHC complex. They become activated and start to secrete [[cytokine]]s. Cytokines are substances that can activate [[cytotoxic T lymphocytes]] (CTL), antibody-secreting [[B cells]], [[macrophages]], and other particles.

Some antigens start out as exogenous antigens, and later become endogenous (for example, intracellular viruses). Intracellular antigens can be released back into circulation upon the destruction of the infected cell, again.

===Endogenous antigens===
Endogenous antigens are antigens that have been generated within previously-normal cells as a result of normal cell [[metabolism]], or because of viral or intracellular bacterial [[infection]]. The fragments are then presented on the cell surface in the complex with [[MHC class I]] molecules. If activated [[Cytotoxic T cell|cytotoxic CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells]] recognize them, the T cells begin to secrete various [[toxin]]s that cause the [[lysis]] or [[apoptosis]] of the infected cell. In order to keep the cytotoxic cells from killing cells just for presenting self-proteins, self-reactive T cells are deleted from the repertoire as a result of [[tolerance]] (also known as [[negative selection]]). Endogenous antigens include [[xenogenic]] (heterologous), [[autologous]] and [[idiotype|idiotypic]] or [[immunoglobulin allotype|allogenic]] (homologous) antigens.

===Autoantigens===
An [[autoantigen]] is usually a normal protein or complex of proteins (and sometimes DNA or RNA) that is recognized by the immune system of patients suffering from a specific [[autoimmune disease]]. These antigens should, under normal conditions, not be the target of the immune system, but, due to mainly genetic and environmental factors, the normal [[immunological tolerance]] for such an antigen has been lost in these patients.

==Tumor antigens==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Immune system]] --&gt;
''[[Tumor antigen]]s'' or ''neoantigens'' are{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} those antigens that are presented by  [[MHC I]] or [[MHC II]] molecules on the surface of [[tumor cell]]s. These antigens can sometimes be presented by tumor cells and never by the normal ones. In this case, they are called [[tumor-specific antigen]]s (TSAs) and, in general, result from a tumor-specific mutation. More common are antigens that are presented by tumor cells and normal cells, and they are called [[tumor-associated antigen]]s (TAAs). [[Cytotoxic T lymphocytes]] that recognize these antigens may be able to destroy the tumor cells before they proliferate or [[metastasize]].

Tumor antigens can also be on the surface of the tumor in the form of, for example, a mutated receptor, in which case they will be recognized by [[B cells]].

==Nativity==
A '''native antigen''' is an antigen that is not yet processed by an APC to smaller parts. [[T cells]] cannot bind native antigens, but require that they be processed by APCs, whereas [[B cells]] can be activated by native ones.

==Antigenic specificity==
'''Antigen(ic) specificity''' is the ability of the host cells to recognize an antigen specifically as a unique molecular entity and distinguish it from another with exquisite precision. Antigen specificity is due primarily to the side-chain conformations of the antigen. It is a measurement, although the degree of specificity may not be easy to measure, and need not be linear or of the nature of a rate-limited step or equation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.steadyhealth.com/encyclopedia/Antigen_specificity&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''autosome''' is a [[chromosome]] that is not a [[sex chromosome]], or [[allosome]]; that is to say, there is an equal number of copies of the chromosome in males and females.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last=Griffiths | first=Anthony J.

In addition to autosomes, there are sex chromosomes, to be specific: [[X chromosome|X]] and [[Y chromosome|Y]]. So, humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes.

To coordinate its overt and covert operations as Al-Qaeda's ambitions and resources increased, it developed a decentralized, regional structure. [...] As a global multinational, Al-Qaeda makes its constituent nationalities and ethnic groups, of which there are several dozen, responsible for a particular geographic region. Although its ''modus operandi'' is cellular, familial relationships play a key role.&quot;&lt;br/&gt; See also:

*{{Cite journal|last=Naím|first=Moisés|authorlink=Moisés Naím|title=The Five Wars of Globalization|journal=[[Foreign Policy (magazine)|Foreign Policy]]|issue=134|pages=28–37|date=January/February 2003|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a radical [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] [[Muslim]] movement calling for global [[Jihad]].

Al-Qaeda has attacked civilian and military targets in various countries, such as the [[September 11 attacks]], [[1998 United States embassy bombings|US embassy bombings]] and [[2002 Bali bombings|Bali bombings]]. The [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]] responded by launching the [[War on Terror]].  Al-Qaeda has continued to exist and grow through the decade from 2001 to 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/67467/leah-farrall/how-al-qaeda-works &quot;How al Qaeda works: What the organization's subsidiaries say about its strength&quot;, by Leah Farrall, [[Foreign Affairs]], March/April 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

Characteristic techniques include [[suicide attack]]s and simultaneous bombings of different targets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wright|2006|pp=107–108, 185, 270–271}}&lt;/ref&gt; Activities ascribed to it may involve members of the movement, who have taken a pledge of loyalty to [[Osama bin Laden]], or the much more numerous &quot;al-Qaeda-linked&quot; individuals who have undergone training in one of its camps in [[Afghanistan]], [[Pakistan]], [[Iraq]] or [[Sudan]], but not taken any pledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wright|2006|p=270}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-Qaeda ideologues envision a complete break from the foreign influences in [[Muslim world|Muslim countries]], and the creation of a new Islamic [[caliphate]]. Reported beliefs include that a [[Christian]]-[[Jewish]] alliance is conspiring to destroy Islam,&lt;ref&gt;Fu'ad Husayn `Al-Zarqawi ... &quot;The Second Generation of al-Qa’ida, Part Fourteen,&quot; ''Al-Quds al-Arabi'', July 13, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; which is largely embodied in the [[Israel&amp;nbsp;– United States relations|U.S.-Israel alliance]], and that the killing of bystanders and civilians is religiously justified in jihad.

Al-Qaeda is also responsible for instigating [[sectarian violence among Muslims]].&lt;ref&gt;Dragons and Tigers: A Geography of South, East, and Southeast Asia - (2011) - Barbara A. Weightman&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Qaeda is intolerant of non-Sunni branches of Islam and denounce them with [[excommunication]]s called &quot;[[takfir]]&quot;. Al-Qaeda leaders regard [[Liberal movements within Islam|liberal Muslims]], [[Shia]]s, [[Sufi]]s and other sects as heretics and sometimes issue attacks on their mosques and gatherings.&lt;ref&gt;Security strategy and transatlantic relations (2006) Roland Dannreuther&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of sectarian attacks include the [[2007 Yazidi communities bombings|Yazidi community bombings]], [[23 November 2006 Sadr City bombings|Sadr City bombings]], [[Ashoura Massacre]] and [[18 April 2007 Baghdad bombings|April 2007 Baghdad bombings]].&lt;ref&gt;Jihad and Just War in the War on Terror (2011) Alia Brahimi&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-Qaeda is also known as the '''International Islamic Front for Jihad Against the Crusaders and the Jews'''.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Washington Post]], May 2, 2011, page A6.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
Al-Qaeda's management philosophy has been described as &quot;centralization of decision and decentralization of execution.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;al-Hammadi, Khalid, `The Inside Story of al-Qa'ida,` part 4, ''Al-Quds al-Arabi'', March 22, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[War on Terror]], it is thought that al-Qaeda's leadership has &quot;become geographically isolated&quot;, leading to the &quot;emergence of decentralized leadership&quot; of regional groups using the al-Qaeda &quot;[[brand]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Aug 13, 2004 |url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/FH13Ak05.html |title=Evolution of the al-Qaeda brand name |publisher=Atimes.com |date=2004-08-13 |accessdate=2010-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sitemaker.umich.edu/satran/files/twq06spring_atran.pdf |title=The Moral Logic and Growth of Suicide Terrorism&amp;nbsp;– SPRING 2006 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many terrorism experts do not believe that the global [[jihad]]ist movement is driven at every level by bin Laden and his followers. Although bin Laden still had huge ideological sway over some Muslim [[extremist]]s, experts argue that al-Qaeda has fragmented over the years into a variety of disconnected regional movements that have little connection with each other. [[Marc Sageman]], a psychiatrist and former [[CIA]] officer, said that al-Qaeda would now just be a &quot;loose label for a movement that seems to target the West&quot;. &quot;There is no umbrella organisation. We like to create a mythical entity called [al-Qaeda] in our minds, but that is not the reality we are dealing with.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;FT Threat&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|last=Blitz|first=James|journal=Financial Times|title=A threat transformed|date=January 19, 2010|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/af31e344-0499-11df-8603-00144feabdc0.html|accessdate=January 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indeed this view mirrors the account given by Osama bin Laden in his October 2001 interview by [[Tayseer Allouni]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;...this matter isn't about any specific person and...is not about the al-Qai`dah Organization. We are the children of an Islamic Nation, with Prophet Muhammad as its leader, our Lord is one...and all the true believers [mu'mineen] are brothers.

So the situation isn't like the West portrays it, that there is an &quot;organization&quot; with a specific name (such as &quot;al-Qai`dah&quot;) and so on. That particular name is very old. It was born without any intention from us. Brother Abu Ubaida... created a military base to train the young men to fight against the vicious, arrogant, brutal, terrorizing Soviet empire... So this place was called &quot;The Base&quot; [&quot;Al-Qai`dah&quot;], as in a training base, so this name grew and became.

We aren't separated from this nation. We are the children of a nation, and we are an unseperable part of it, and from those public demonstrations which spread from the far east, from the Philippines, to Indonesia, to Malaysia, to India, to Pakistan, reaching Mauritania... and so we discuss the conscience of this nation.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;


Others, however, see al-Qaeda as an integrated network that is strongly led from the Pakistani tribal areas and has a powerful strategic purpose. [[Bruce Hoffman]], a terrorism expert at [[Georgetown University]], said &quot;It amazes me that people don't think there is a clear adversary out there, and that our adversary does not have a strategic approach.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;FT Threat&quot;/&gt;

===Leadership===
Information mostly acquired from [[Jamal al-Fadl]] provided American authorities with a rough picture of how the group was organized. While the veracity of the information provided by al-Fadl and the motivation for his cooperation are both disputed, American authorities base much of their current knowledge of al-Qaeda on his testimony.&lt;ref name=&quot;first informant&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|McGeary|2001}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Osama bin Laden]] was the [[emir]], or commander, and was the Senior Operations Chief of al-Qaeda. Bin Laden was killed on May 1, 2011 by US forces. It has been reported that [[Saif al-Adel]] has now succeeded Bin laden in this role. 

[[Ayman al-Zawahiri]] is al-Qaeda's Deputy Operations Chief

As of August 6, 2010, the chief of operations was considered to be [[Adnan Gulshair el Shukrijumah]], replacing [[Khalid Sheikh Mohammed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Anderson |first=Curt |url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2010-08-06-al-qaeda-leader_N.htm |title=&quot;New al-Qaeda leader lived in U.S. for years&quot;, by Curt Anderson, August 6, 2010, Associated Press |publisher=Usatoday.com |date=2010-08-06 |accessdate=2011-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bin Laden was advised by a [[Shura Council]], which consists of senior al-Qaeda members, estimated by Western officials at about 20–30 people. [[Abu Musab al-Zarqawi]] was the senior leader of al-Qaeda in Iraq, but his safehouse was hit by U.S. missiles in a [[targeted killing]], and [[Abu Ayyub al-Masri]] succeeded him who was also later killed by US and Iraqi forces on April 18, 2010.

Al-Qaeda's network was built from scratch as a conspiratorial network that draws on leaders of all its regional nodes &quot;as and when necessary to serve as an integral part of its high command.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gunaratna|2002|p=54}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

* The Military Committee is responsible for training operatives, acquiring weapons, and planning attacks.
* The Money/Business Committee funds the recruitment and training of operatives through the ''[[hawala]]'' banking system. U.S-led efforts to eradicate the sources of [[terrorist financing]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|White House|2003}}.&lt;/ref&gt; were most successful in the year immediately following September 11;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Basile|2004|p=177}}.&lt;/ref&gt; al-Qaeda continues to operate through unregulated banks, such as the 1,000 or so ''hawaladars'' in Pakistan, some of which can handle deals of up to $10 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wechsler|2001|p=135}}; cited in {{Harvnb|Gunaratna|2002|p=63}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It also provides air tickets and false passports, pays al-Qaeda members, and oversees profit-driven businesses.&lt;ref&gt;Businesses are run from below, with the council only being consulted on new proposals and collecting funds.&lt;br/&gt; See:

*{{Harvnb|Hoffman|2002}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[9/11 Commission Report]]'', it was estimated that al-Qaeda required $30 million-per-year to conduct its operations.
* The Law Committee reviews [[Sharia law]], and decides whether particular courses of action conform to the law.
* The Islamic Study/''[[Fatwā|Fatwah]]'' Committee issues religious edicts, such as an edict in 1998 telling Muslims to kill Americans.
* In the late 1990s there was a publicly known Media Committee, which ran the now-defunct newspaper ''Nashrat al Akhbar (Newscast)'' and handled [[public relations]].
* In 2005, al-Qaeda formed [[As-Sahab]], a media production house, to supply its video and audio materials.

===Command structure===
When asked about the possibility of al-Qaeda's connection to the [[7 July 2005 London bombings]] in 2005, [[Metropolitan Police Commissioner]] [[Sir Ian Blair]] said: &quot;Al-Qaeda is not an organization. Al-Qaeda is a way of working ... but this has the hallmark of that approach ... Al-Qaeda clearly has the ability to provide training ... to provide expertise ... and I think that is what has occurred here.&quot;&lt;ref name='foxnewsblair'&gt;{{Cite news| first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Cops: London Attacks Were Homicide Blasts | date= 2005-07-15| publisher= | url =http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,162476,00.html | work =[[Fox News]] | pages = | accessdate = 2008-06-15 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, on August 13, 2005, ''[[The Independent]]'' newspaper, quoting police and [[MI5]] investigations, reported that the 7 July bombers acted independently of an al-Qaeda terror mastermind someplace abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title= London bombings: the truth emerges | url=http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/crime/article305547.ece | first=Jason | last=Bennetto | coauthors=Ian Herbert | work=The Independent | date=2005-08-13 | accessdate=2006-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

What exactly al-Qaeda is, or was, remains in dispute. Author and journalist [[Adam Curtis]] contends that the idea of al-Qaeda as a formal organization is primarily an American invention. Curtis contends the name &quot;al-Qaeda&quot; was first brought to the attention of the public in the 2001 trial of bin Laden and the four men accused of the [[1998 U.S. embassy bombings]] in East Africa:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The reality was that bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri had become the focus of a loose association of disillusioned Islamist militants who were attracted by the new strategy. But there was no organization. These were militants who mostly planned their own operations and looked to bin Laden for funding and assistance. He was not their commander. There is also no evidence that bin Laden used the term &quot;al-Qaeda&quot; to refer to the name of a group until after September the 11th, when he realized that this was the term the Americans had given it.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Power of Nightmares&quot;&gt;[http://www.archive.org/details/ThePowerOfNightmares ''The Power of Nightmares''], BBC Documentary.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As a matter of law, the [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Department of Justice]] needed to show that bin Laden was the leader of a criminal organization in order to charge him ''[[in absentia]]'' under the [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act]], also known as the RICO statutes. The name of the organization and details of its structure were provided in the testimony of [[Jamal al-Fadl]], who said he was a founding member of the organization and a former employee of bin Laden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McCloud|first=Kimberly|title=WMD Terrorism and Usama bin Laden |url=http://cns.miis.edu/reports/binladen.htm|work=CNS Reports|publisher=James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies|accessdate=4 May 2011|coauthors=Osborne, Matthew|date=7 March 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Questions about the reliability of al-Fadl's testimony have been raised by a number of sources because of his history of dishonesty, and because he was delivering it as part of a [[plea bargain]] agreement after being convicted of conspiring to attack U.S. military establishments.&lt;ref name=&quot;first informant&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

|accessdate=2007-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sam Schmidt, one of his defense lawyers, said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;There were selective portions of al-Fadl's testimony that I believe was false, to help support the picture that he helped the Americans join together. I think he lied in a number of specific testimony about a unified image of what this organization was. It made al-Qaeda the new Mafia or the new Communists. It made them identifiable as a group and therefore made it easier to prosecute any person associated with al-Qaeda for any acts or statements made by bin Laden.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Power of Nightmares&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Field operatives===
The number of individuals in the organization who have undergone proper military training, and are capable of commanding insurgent forces, is largely unknown. In 2006, it was estimated that al-Qaeda had several thousand commanders embedded in 40 different countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cassidy&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Cassidy|2006|p=9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2009, it was believed that no more than 200–300 members were still active commanders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

According to the award-winning 2004 [[BBC]] documentary ''[[The Power of Nightmares]]'', al-Qaeda was so weakly linked together that it was hard to say it existed apart from bin Laden and a small clique of close associates. The lack of any significant numbers of convicted al-Qaeda members, despite a large number of arrests on terrorism charges, was cited by the documentary as a reason to doubt whether a widespread entity that met the description of al-Qaeda existed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

===Insurgent forces===
According to [[Robert Cassidy]], al-Qaeda controls two separate forces deployed alongside insurgents in Iraq and Pakistan. The first, numbering in the tens of thousands, was &quot;organized, trained, and equipped as insurgent combat forces&quot; in the Soviet-Afghan war.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cassidy&quot;/&gt; It was made up primarily of foreign ''[[mujahideen]]'' from Saudi Arabia and Yemen. Many went on to fight in Bosnia and Somalia for global ''jihad''. Another group, approximately 10,000 strong, live in Western states and have received rudimentary combat training.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cassidy&quot;/&gt;

Other analysts have described al-Qaeda's rank and file as changing from being &quot;predominantly Arab,&quot; in its first years of operation, to &quot;largely Pakistani,&quot; as of 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.meforum.org/article/1710 Jihad's New Leaders] by Daveed Gartenstein-Ross and Kyle Dabruzzi, ''Middle East Quarterly'', Summer 2007&lt;/ref&gt; It has been estimated that 62% of al-Qaeda members have university education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=July 3, 2007 |url=http://www.canada.com/nationalpost/news/story.html?id=c841b52c-b2e7-4e41-b27e-33d10245b935&amp;k=0 |title=Today's jihadists: educated, wealthy and bent on killing? |publisher=Canada.com |date=2007-07-03 |accessdate=2010-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Financing===
The majority of financing for al-Qeada in the 1990s and [[2000s (decade)|2000s]] came from the personal wealth of Osama bin Laden which was estimated at around $300 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forbes.com/2001/09/14/0914ladenmoney.html Cost of bin Laden] retrieved 5 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources of income include the [[heroin trade]] and donations from supporters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forbes.com/2001/09/14/0914whoisobl.html Who is Bin Laden?] retrieved 5 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strategy==
On March 11, 2005, ''[[Al-Quds Al-Arabi]]'' published extracts from [[Saif al-Adel]]'s document &quot;Al Quaeda's Strategy to the Year 2020&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ypICzykNXiAC&amp;pg=PA221&amp;lpg=PA221&amp;dq=makkawi+strategy+2020&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1iFik9U91G&amp;sig=vF2xfwHZ76rhNWD74T2nSmonrdc&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=GJo7TOLyJYH88AbAu4GPBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=makkawi%20strategy%202020&amp;f=false |title=Abdel Bari Atwan. &quot;The Secret History of Al Qaeda&quot;, p. 221.

# Provoke the United States into invading a Muslim country.
# Incite local resistance to occupying forces.
# Expand the conflict to neighboring countries, and engage the U.S. in a long war of attrition.
# Convert al-Qaeda into an ideology and set of operating principles that can be loosely franchised in other countries without requiring direct command and control, and via these franchises incite attacks against countries allied with the U.S. until they withdraw from the conflict, as happened with the [[2004 Madrid train bombings]], but which did not have the same effect with the [[7 July 2005 London bombings]].
# The U.S. economy will finally collapse under the strain of too many engagements in too many places, similarly to the [[Soviet war in Afghanistan]], Arab regimes supported by the U.S. will collapse, and a [[Wahhabi]] [[Caliphate]] will be installed across the region.

==Etymology==
In [[Arabic language|Arabic]], ''al-Qaeda'' has four syllables ({{IPA-ar|ælˈqɑːʕɪdɐ}}). However, since two of the Arabic consonants in the name (the [[voiceless uvular plosive]] {{IPA|[q]}} and the [[voiced pharyngeal fricative]] {{IPA|[ʕ]}}) are not [[phone (phonetics)|phones]] found in the [[English language]], the closest naturalized [[English phonology|English pronunciations]] include {{IPAc-en|æ|l|ˈ|k|aɪ|d|ə}}, {{IPAc-en|æ|l|ˈ|k|eɪ|d|ə}} and {{IPAc-en|ˌ|æ|l|k|ɑː|ˈ|iː|d|ə}}.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} al-Qaeda's name can also be [[transliteration|transliterated]] as al-Qaida, al-Qa'ida, el-Qaida, or al-Qaeda.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ibb7.ibb.gov/pronunciations/sounds/2930.ra Listen to the U.S. pronunciation] ([[RealPlayer]]).&lt;/ref&gt;

The name comes from the Arabic noun ''qā'idah'', which means ''foundation'' or ''basis'', and can also refer to a [[military base]]. The initial ''al-'' is the Arabic [[article (grammar)|definite article]] ''the'', hence ''the base''.&lt;ref&gt;Arabic Computer Dictionary: English-Arabic, Arabic-English By Ernest Kay, Multi-lingual International Publishers, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bin Laden explained the origin of the term in a videotaped interview with [[Aljazeera|Al Jazeera]] journalist [[Tayseer Alouni]] in October 2001:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The name 'al-Qaeda' was established a long time ago by mere chance. The late [[Abu Ubaidah al-Banshiri|Abu Ebeida El-Banashiri]] established the training camps for our ''[[mujahedeen]]'' against Russia's terrorism. We used to call the training camp al-Qaeda. The name stayed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/asiapcf/south/02/05/binladen.transcript/index.html |title=Transcript of Bin Laden's October interview |publisher=CNN |date=2002-02-05 |accessdate=2006-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It has been argued that two documents seized from the [[Sarajevo]] office of the [[Benevolence International Foundation]] prove that the name was not simply adopted by the ''mujahid'' movement and that a group called al-Qaeda was established in August 1988. Both of these documents contain minutes of meetings held to establish a new military group, and contain the term &quot;al-Qaeda&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bergen|2006|p=75}}. Wright indirectly quotes one of the documents, based on an exhibit from the &quot;Tareek Osama&quot; document presented in &lt;span class=&quot;plainlinks&quot;&gt;[http://fl1.findlaw.com/news.findlaw.com/hdocs/docs/bif/usarnaout10603prof.pdf ''United States v. Enaam M. Arnaout'']&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Former British [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] [[Robin Cook]] wrote that the word al-Qaeda should be translated as &quot;the database&quot;, and originally referred to the computer file of the thousands of ''mujahideen'' militants who were recruited and trained with CIA help to defeat the Russians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Robin Cook |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2005/jul/08/july7.development |title=Robin Cook: The struggle against terrorism cannot be won by military means |publisher=The Guardian |date= 2005-07-08|accessdate=2011-05-08 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2002, the group assumed the name ''Qa'idat al-Jihad'', which means &quot;the base of Jihad&quot;. According to [[Al-Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies|Diaa Rashwan]], this was &quot;apparently as a result of the merger of the overseas branch of Egypt's [[Egyptian Islamic Jihad|al-Jihad]] (Egyptian Islamist Jihad, or EIJ) group, led by [[Ayman El-Zawahiri]], with the groups Bin Laden brought under his control after his return to Afghanistan in the mid-1990s.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2003/619/op13.htm After Mombassa]&quot;, ''[[Al-Ahram Weekly|Al-Ahram Weekly Online]]'', January 2–8, 2003 (Issue No. 619). Retrieved September 3, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideology==
{{See also|Qutbism}}
{{Islamism sidebar}}
The radical [[Islamist]] movement in general and al-Qaeda in particular developed during the [[Islamic revival]] and [[Islamism|Islamist movement]] of the last three decades of the 20th century, along with less extreme movements.

Some have argued that &quot;without the writings&quot; of Islamic author and thinker [[Sayyid Qutb]], &quot;al-Qaeda would not have existed.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wright|2006|p=332}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Qutb preached that because of the lack of ''[[sharia]]'' law, the Muslim world was no longer Muslim, having reverted to pre-Islamic ignorance known as ''[[jahiliyyah]]''.

To restore Islam, he said a vanguard movement of righteous Muslims was needed to establish &quot;true [[Islamic state]]s&quot;, implement ''sharia'', and rid the Muslim world of any non-Muslim influences, such as concepts like [[socialism]] and [[nationalism]]. Enemies of Islam in Qutb's view included &quot;treacherous Orientalists&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Qutb|2003|pp=63, 69}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;world Jewry&quot;, who plotted &quot;conspiracies&quot; and &quot;wicked[ly]&quot; opposed Islam.

In the words of [[Mohammed Jamal Khalifa]], a close college friend of bin Laden: &lt;blockquote&gt;Islam is different from any other religion; it's a way of life. We [Khalifa and bin Laden] were trying to understand what Islam has to say about how we eat, who we marry, how we talk. We read Sayyid Qutb. He was the one who most affected our generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wright|2006|p=79}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Qutb had an even greater influence on bin Laden's mentor and another leading member of al-Qaeda,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gemsofislamism.tripod.com/qutb_milest_influence_obl.html |title=How Did Sayyid Qutb Influence Osama bin Laden? |publisher=Gemsofislamism.tripod.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ayman al-Zawahiri. Zawahiri's uncle and maternal family patriarch, Mafouz Azzam, was Qutb's student, then protégé, then personal lawyer, and finally executor of his estate—one of the last people to see Qutb before his execution. &quot;Young Ayman al-Zawahiri heard again and again from his beloved uncle Mahfouz about the purity of Qutb's character and the torment he had endured in prison.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Mafouz Azzam; cited in {{Harvnb|Wright|2006|p=36}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Zawahiri paid homage to Qutb in his work ''Knights under the Prophet's Banner.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gemsofislamism.tripod.com/milestones_qutb.html#footnote_24 |title=Sayyid Qutb's Milestones (footnote 24) |publisher=Gemsofislamism.tripod.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most powerful of Qutb's ideas was that many who said they were Muslims were not. Rather, they were [[apostate]]s. That not only gave jihadists &quot;a legal loophole around the prohibition of killing another Muslim,&quot; but made &quot;it a religious obligation to execute&quot; these self-professed Muslims. These alleged apostates included leaders of Muslim countries, since they failed to enforce ''sharia'' law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carlisle.army.mil/usawc/Parameters/07spring/eikmeier.htm Qutbism: An Ideology of Islamic-Fascism] DALE C. EIKMEIER From ''Parameters'', Spring 2007, pp. 85–98.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Fatwa on Terrorism|fatwa on terrorism]] is regarded as a direct assault on the ideology of al-Qaeda which dismantles it from the sources of ''[[Quran]]'' and ''[[sunnah]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sabel |first=Robbie |url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Article.aspx?id=169949 |title=UK Muslim leader to issue '&amp;#39;fatwa'&amp;#39; against Jihad |publisher=Jpost.com |date= |accessdate=2011-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious compatibility==
[[Abdel Bari Atwan]] writes that:
{{quote|While the leadership's own theological platform is essentially [[Salafi]], the organization's umbrella is sufficiently wide to encompass various schools of thought and political leanings.  Al-Qaeda counts among its members and supporters people associated with [[Wahhabism]], [[Shafi`i|Shafi'ism]], [[Malaki|Malikism]], and [[Hanafi]]sm.  There are even some whose beliefs and practices are directly at odds with Salafism, such as [[Yunis Khalis]], one of the leaders of the Afghan ''[[mujahedin]]''.  He is a mystic who visits tombs of saints and seeks their blessings—practices inimical to bin Laden's Wahhabi-Salafi school of thought.  The only exception to this pan-Islamic policy is [[Shi'ism]].  Al-Qaeda seems implacably opposed to it, as it holds Shi'ism to be heresy.  In Iraq it has openly declared war on the [[Badr Brigades]], who have fully cooperated with the US, and now considers even Shi'i civilians to be legitimate targets for acts of violence.&lt;ref name=AbdelBariAtwan&gt;Abdel Bari Atwan. &quot;The Secret History of Al Qaeda&quot;, p. 233.

At the same time, a growing number of Arab ''mujahideen'' joined the ''jihad'' against the [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan|Afghan Marxist regime]], facilitated by international Muslim organizations, particularly the [[Maktab al-Khidamat]],&lt;ref name=MAKTAB-AL-KHIDAMAT-GLOBALSECURITY&gt;{{cite web

[[Maktab al-Khidamat]] (MAK), or the &quot;Services Office&quot;, a Muslim organization founded in 1980 to raise and channel funds and recruit foreign ''mujahideen'' for the war against the Soviets in Afghanistan, was established by [[Abdullah Yusuf Azzam]], a Palestinian Islamic scholar and member of the [[Muslim Brotherhood]], and bin Laden in [[Peshawar]], [[Pakistan]], in 1984.

[[File:Omar Abdel-Rahman.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Omar Abdel-Rahman]]]]
From 1986, it began to set up a network of recruiting offices in the U.S., the hub of which was the [[Al Kifah Refugee Center]] at the Farouq Mosque in [[Brooklyn]]'s Atlantic Avenue. Among notable figures at the Brooklyn center were &quot;double agent&quot; [[Ali Mohamed]], whom FBI special agent Jack Cloonan called &quot;bin Laden's first trainer,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline//////torture/interviews/cloonan.html Cloonan ''Frontline'' interview], PBS, July 13, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;Blind Sheikh&quot; [[Omar Abdel-Rahman]], a leading recruiter of ''mujahideen'' for Afghanistan. Al-Qaeda evolved from the MAK.

MAK organized [[Al-Qaeda safe house|guest houses]] in Peshawar, near the Afghan border, and gathered supplies for the construction of paramilitary training camps to prepare foreign recruits for the Afghan war front. Azzam persuaded bin Laden to join MAK.{{When|date=September 2009}} Bin Laden became a &quot;major financier&quot; of the ''mujahideen'', spending his own money and using his connections with &quot;the Saudi royal family and the petro-billionaires of the Gulf&quot; in order to improve public opinion of the war and raise more funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gunaratna|2002|p=19}}. Quotes taken from {{Harvnb|Riedel|2008|p=42}} and {{Harvnb|Wright|2006|p=103}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 1987, Azzam and bin Laden started creating camps inside Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sageman|2004|p=35}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

U.S. government financial support for the Afghan Islamic militants was substantial. Aid to [[Gulbuddin Hekmatyar]], an Afghan ''mujahideen'' leader. and founder and leader of the [[Hezb-e Islami]] radical Islamic militant faction, alone amounted &quot;by the most conservative estimates&quot; to $600 million. Hekmatyar &quot;worked closely&quot; with bin Laden in the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Bergen, Peter L., ''Holy war, Inc.: Inside the Secret World of Osama bin Laden'', New York: Free Press, c2001., p.70-1&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to hundreds of millions of dollars of American aid, Hekmatyar also received the lion's share of aid from the Saudis.&lt;ref&gt;Bergen, Peter L., ''Holy war, Inc.: inside the secret world of Osama bin Laden'', New York: Free Press, c2001., p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence that the [[CIA drug trafficking|CIA supported]] Hekmatyar's [[illegal drug trade|drug trade activities]] by giving him immunity for his opium trafficking that financed operation of his militant faction.&lt;ref name=Rienzo&gt;Interview with Alfred McCoy, 9 November 1991 by [[Paul DeRienzo]][http://www.bearcave.com/bookrev/nugan_hand.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

The MAK and foreign ''mujahideen'' volunteers, or &quot;Afghan Arabs,&quot; did not play a major role in the war. While over 250,000 Afghan ''mujahideen'' fought the Soviets and the communist Afghan government, it is estimated that were never more than 2,000 foreign ''mujahideen'' in the field at any one time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wright|2006|p=137}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, foreign ''mujahideen'' volunteers came from 43 countries, and the total number that participated in the Afghan movement between 1982 and 1992 is reported to have been 35,000.&lt;ref name=THE-WAR-ON-TERROR-AND-THE-POLITICS-OF-VIOLENCE-IN-PAKISTAN&gt;{{cite web

''The Guardian''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Soviet Union finally withdrew from Afghanistan in 1989. To the surprise of many, [[Mohammad Najibullah]]'s communist Afghan government hung on for three more years, before being overrun by elements of the ''mujahideen''. With ''mujahideen'' leaders unable to agree on a structure for governance, chaos ensued, with constantly reorganizing alliances fighting for control of ill-defined territories, leaving the country devastated.

===Expanding operations===
{{Editorial|date=May 2011}}
{{rquote|right|the correlation between the words and deeds of bin Laden, his lieutenants, and their allies was close to perfect—if they said they were going to do something, they were much more than likely to try to do it. Their record in this regard puts Western leaders to shame.|[[Michael Scheuer]], CIA Station Chief&lt;ref name=&quot;schu&quot;&gt;Scehuer, Michael. &quot;Marching Towards Hell&quot;, 2008. p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Toward the end of the [[Red Army|Soviet military]] mission in Afghanistan, some ''mujahideen'' wanted to expand their operations to include Islamist struggles in other parts of the world, such as Israel and [[Kashmir]]. A number of overlapping and interrelated organizations were formed, to further those aspirations.

One of these was the organization that would eventually be called al-Qaeda, formed by bin Laden with an initial meeting held on August 11, 1988.&lt;ref name=THE-OSAMA-BIN-LADEN-I-KNOW&gt;{{cite web
|title=The Osama bin Laden I know

Notes of a meeting of bin Laden and others on August 20, 1988, indicate al-Qaeda was a formal group by that time: &quot;basically an organized Islamic faction, its goal is to lift the word of God, to make His religion victorious.&quot; A list of requirements for membership itemized the following: listening ability, good manners, obedience, and making a pledge (''[[Bay'at|bayat]]'') to follow one's superiors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wright|2006|pp=133–134}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Wright, the group's real name wasn't used in public pronouncements because &quot;its existence was still a closely held secret.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wright|2006|p=260}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His research suggests that al-Qaeda was formed at an August 11, 1988, meeting between &quot;several senior leaders&quot; of Egyptian Islamic Jihad, [[Abdullah Yusuf Azzam|Abdullah Azzam]], and bin Laden, where it was agreed to join bin Laden's money with the expertise of the Islamic Jihad organization and take up the jihadist cause elsewhere after the Soviets withdrew from Afghanistan.&lt;ref name=&quot;RebellionWright&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Wright|2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bin Laden wished to establish non-military operations in other parts of the world; Azzam, in contrast, wanted to remain focused on military campaigns. After Azzam was assassinated in 1989, the MAK split, with a significant number joining bin Laden's organization.

In November 1989, [[Ali Mohamed]], a former [[special forces]] Sergeant stationed at [[Fort Bragg (North Carolina)|Fort Bragg]], [[North Carolina]], left military service and moved to California. He traveled to Afghanistan and Pakistan and became &quot;deeply involved with bin Laden's plans.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wright|2006|p=181}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A year later, on November 8, 1990, the FBI raided the New Jersey home of Ali Mohammed's associate [[El Sayyid Nosair]], discovering a great deal of evidence of terrorist plots, including plans to blow up New York City skyscrapers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://classic-web.archive.org/web/20080302005340/http://www.tkb.org/CaseHome.jsp?caseid=332 |title=Legal case profiles - USA v.

In 1991, Ali Mohammed is said to have helped orchestrate bin Laden's relocation to Sudan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Gulf War and the start of U.S. enmity===
{{Main|Gulf War}}

Following the Soviet Union's withdrawal from Afghanistan in February 1989, bin Laden returned to Saudi Arabia. The [[Iraq]]i [[invasion of Kuwait]] in August 1990 had put the Kingdom and its ruling [[House of Saud]] at risk. The world's most valuable [[oil field]]s were within easy striking distance of Iraqi forces in Kuwait, and Saddam's call to pan-Arab/Islamism could potentially rally internal dissent.

In the face of a seemingly massive Iraqi military presence, Saudi Arabia's own forces were well armed but far outnumbered. Bin Laden offered the services of his ''mujahideen'' to [[Fahd of Saudi Arabia|King Fahd]] to protect Saudi Arabia from the Iraqi army. The Saudi monarch refused bin Laden's offer, opting instead to allow U.S. and allied forces to deploy troops into Saudi territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Jehl | first = Douglas | title = A Nation Challenged: Holy war lured Saudis as rulers looked away | work = The New York Times | date = 2001-12-27 | pages = A1, B4 | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/27/world/a-nation-challenged-saudi-arabia-holy-war-lured-saudis-as-rulers-looked-away.html | accessdate = 2009-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The deployment angered Bin Laden, as he believed the presence of foreign troops in the &quot;land of the two mosques&quot; ([[Mecca]] and [[Medina]]) profaned sacred soil. After speaking publicly against the Saudi government for harboring American troops, he was banished and forced to live in exile in Sudan.

===Sudan===
From around 1992 to 1996, al-Qaeda and bin Laden based themselves in [[Sudan]] at the invitation of Islamist theoretician [[Hassan al Turabi]]. The move followed an Islamist coup d'état in Sudan, led by Colonel [[Omar al-Bashir]], who professed a commitment to reordering Muslim political values. During this time, bin Laden assisted the Sudanese government, bought or set up various business enterprises, and established camps where insurgents trained.

A key turning point for bin Laden, further pitting him against the Sauds, occurred in 1993 when Saudi Arabia gave support for the [[Oslo Accords]], which set a path for peace between [[Israel]] and [[Palestinians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Riedel|2008|p=52}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Zawahiri and the EIJ, who served as the core of al-Qaeda but also engaged in separate operations against the Egyptian government, had bad luck in Sudan. In 1993, a young schoolgirl was killed in an unsuccessful EIJ attempt on the life of the Egyptian prime minister, [[Atef Sedki]]. Egyptian public opinion turned against Islamist bombings, and the police arrested 280 of al-Jihad's members and executed 6.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wright|2006|p=186}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to bin Laden's continuous verbal assault on King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, on 5 March 1994 Fahd sent an emissary to Sudan demanding bin Laden's passport; bin Laden's Saudi citizenship was also revoked. His family was persuaded to cut off his monthly stipend, $7 million (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|7000000|1994|r=-5}}}} in current dollar terms) a year, and his Saudi assets were frozen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wright|2006|p=195}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=OSAMA-BIN-LADEN-A-CHRONOLOGY-OF-HIS-POLITICAL-LIFE&gt;{{cite web

In June 1995 an even more ill-fated [[Egyptian Islamic Jihad#Mubarak assassination attempt|attempt to assassinate Egyptian president Mubarak]] led to the expulsion of EIJ, and in May 1996, of bin Laden, by the Sudanese government.

According to [[Pakistani-American]] businessman [[Mansoor Ijaz]], the Sudanese government offered the [[Clinton Administration]] numerous opportunities to arrest bin Laden. Those opportunities were met positively by Secretary of State [[Madeleine Albright]], but spurned when [[Susan Rice]] and counter-terrorism czar [[Richard A. Clarke|Richard Clarke]] persuaded National Security Advisor [[Sandy Berger]] to overrule Albright. Ijaz’s claims appeared in numerous [[Op-Ed]] pieces, including one in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''
&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/dec/05/opinion/oe-ijaz05 |title=Clinton Let Bin Laden Slip Away and Metastasize|publisher= Los Angeles Times  |date=2001-12-05 |accessdate=2010-03-22 | first=Mansoor | last=Ijaz}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' co-written with former Ambassador to Sudan [[Timothy M. Carney]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A64828-2002Jun29|title=Intelligence Failure?

Several sources dispute Ijaz's claim, including the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks on the U.S. (the 9–11 Commission), which concluded in part: &lt;blockquote&gt;Sudan's minister of defense, Fatih Erwa, has claimed that Sudan offered to hand Bin Ladin over to the U.S. The Commission has found no credible evidence that this was so. Ambassador Carney had instructions only to push the Sudanese to expel Bin Ladin. Ambassador Carney had no legal basis to ask for more from the Sudanese since, at the time, there was no indictment out-standing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/911/report/911Report_Ch4.htm |title=National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States |publisher=Govinfo.library.unt.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Refuge in Afghanistan===
{{Main|Taliban's rise to power|Afghan training camp}}

After the Soviet withdrawal, Afghanistan was effectively ungoverned for seven years and plagued by constant infighting between former allies and various ''mujahideen'' groups.

Throughout the 1990s, a new force began to emerge. The origins of the [[Taliban]] (literally &quot;students&quot;) lay in the children of Afghanistan, many of them orphaned by the war, and many of whom had been educated in the rapidly expanding network of Islamic schools ([[madrassa]]s) either in [[Kandahar]] or in the refugee camps on the Afghan-Pakistani border.

According to [[Ahmed Rashid]], five leaders of the Taliban were graduates of [[Darul Uloom Haqqania]], a madrassa in the small town of Akora Khattak.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harvnb|Rashid|2002&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Rashid|2002}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The town is situated near [[Peshawar]] in Pakistan, but largely attended by [[Afghan refugees]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Harvnb|Rashid|2002&quot;/&gt; This institution reflected [[Salafi]] beliefs in its teachings, and much of its funding came from private donations from wealthy Arabs. Bin Laden's contacts were still laundering most of these donations, using &quot;unscrupulous&quot; Islamic banks to transfer the money to an &quot;array&quot; of charities which serve as front groups for al-Qaeda, or transporting cash-filled suitcases straight into Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Napoleoni|2003|pp=121–123}}; {{Harvnb|Akacem|2005}} (&quot;[Napoleoni] does a decent job of covering al-Qaida and presents some numbers and estimates that are of value [to terrorism scholars].&quot;).&lt;/ref&gt; Another four of the Taliban's leaders attended a similarly funded and influenced madrassa in Kandahar.

Many of the ''mujahideen'' who later joined the Taliban fought alongside Afghan warlord [[Mohammad Nabi Mohammadi]]'s Harkat i Inqilabi group at the time of the Russian invasion. This group also enjoyed the loyalty of most Afghan Arab fighters.

The continuing internecine strife between various factions, and accompanying lawlessness following the Soviet withdrawal, enabled the growing and well-disciplined Taliban to expand their control over territory in Afghanistan, and it came to establish an enclave which it called the [[Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan]]. In 1994, it captured the regional center of Kandahar, and after making rapid territorial gains thereafter, conquered the capital city [[Kabul]] in September 1996.

After the Sudanese made it clear, in May 1996, that bin Laden would never be welcome to return,{{Clarify|date=September 2009}} Taliban-controlled Afghanistan—with previously established connections between the groups, administered with a shared militancy,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kronstadt|Katzman|2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and largely isolated from American political influence and military power—provided a perfect location for al-Qaeda to relocate its headquarters. Al-Qaeda enjoyed the Taliban's protection and a measure of legitimacy as part of their Ministry of Defense, although only Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and the [[United Arab Emirates]] recognized the Taliban as the legitimate government of Afghanistan.

While in Afghanistan, the Taliban government tasked al-Qaeda with the training of [[055 Brigade|Brigade 055]], an elite part of the Taliban's army from 1997-2001. The Brigade was made up of mostly foreign fighters, many veterans from the Soviet Invasion, and all under the same basic ideology of the [[mujahideen]]. In November 2001, as [[War in Afghanistan (2001-present)|Operation Enduring Freedom]] had toppled the Taliban government, many Brigade 055 fighters were captured or killed, and those that survived were thought to head into Pakistan along with bin Laden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1101011105-181591,00.html | work=Time | first=Daniel | last=Eisenberg | title=Secrets Of Brigade 055 | date=2001-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of 2008, some sources reported that the Taliban had severed any remaining ties with al-Qaeda,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Nic Robertson |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/10/06/afghan.saudi.talks/?iref=mpstoryview |title=CNN.com |publisher=CNN |date= |accessdate=2010-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others cast doubt on this.&lt;ref&gt;Roggio, Bill [http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2008/10/taliban_have_not_spl.php Taliban have not split from al Qaeda: sources] October 7, 2008 ''The Long War Journal''&lt;/ref&gt; According to senior U.S. military intelligence officials, there were fewer than 100 members of al-Qaeda remaining in Afghanistan in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Partlow, Joshua.

===Call for global jihad===
{{Expand section|date=September 2009}}
Around 1994, the Salafi groups waging ''[[Salafist jihadism|jihad]]'' in Bosnia entered into a seemingly irreversible decline. As they grew less and less aggressive, groups such as EIJ began to drift away from the Salafi cause in Europe. Al-Qaeda decided to step in and assumed control of around 80% of the terrorist cells in Bosnia in late 1995.

At the same time, al-Qaeda ideologues instructed the network's recruiters to look for ''[[Jihadi international]]'', Muslims who believed that ''jihad'' must be fought on a global level. The concept of a &quot;global Salafi ''jihad''&quot; had been around since at least the early 1980s. Several groups had formed for the explicit purpose of driving non-Muslims out of every Muslim land, at the same time, and with maximum carnage. This was, however, a fundamentally defensive strategy{{clarify|reason=contradictory sentences: minimum carnage would be fundamentally defensive, maximum carnage would'nt|date=May 2011}}.

Al-Qaeda sought to open the &quot;offensive phase&quot; of the global Salafi ''jihad''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sageman|2004|pp=48, 51}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Bosnian Islamists in 2006 called for &quot;solidarity with Islamic causes around the world&quot;, supporting the insurgents in Kashmir and Iraq as well as the groups fighting for a Palestinian state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Trofimov|2006|p=282}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fatwas===

In June 1996, the [[Khobar Towers bombing]] took place in [[Khobar, Saudi Arabia]], attributed by some to al-Qaeda, killing 19 Americans and one Saudi local, and wounding 372.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=Abdel Bari Atwan |title=The Secret History of Al Qaeda |pages=168–169 |publisher= University of California Press |year=2006 |isbn=0-520-24974-7 |ref=harv |postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

On February 23, 1998, bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri, a leader of Egyptian Islamic Jihad, along with three other Islamist leaders, co-signed and issued a ''fatwa'' calling on Muslims to kill Americans and their allies where they can, when they can.&lt;ref&gt;Summary taken from bin Laden's May 26, 1998 interview with American journalist [[John Miller (journalist)|John Miller]]. Most recently broadcast in the documentary ''Age of Terror'', part 4, with translations checked by Barry Purkis (archive researcher).&lt;/ref&gt; Under the banner of the [[World Islamic Front|World Islamic Front for Combat Against the Jews and Crusaders]], they declared:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[T]he ruling to kill the Americans and their allies—civilians and military—is an individual duty for every Muslim who can do it in any country in which it is possible to do it, in order to liberate the al-Aqsa Mosque [in Jerusalem] and the holy mosque [in Mecca] from their grip, and in order for their armies to move out of all the lands of Islam, defeated and unable to threaten any Muslim.

Neither bin Laden nor al-Zawahiri possessed the traditional Islamic scholarly qualifications to issue a ''fatwa''. However, they rejected the authority of the contemporary ''[[ulema]]'' (which they saw as the paid servants of ''[[jahiliyya]]'' rulers), and took it upon themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Benjamin|Simon|2002|p=117}}. &quot;By issuing fatwas, bin Laden and his followers are acting out a kind of self-appointment as alim: they are asserting their rights as interpreters of Islamic law.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify credibility|reason=questionable statement as at least one of the other signers of the fatwa may have indeed been able to issue such an edict&amp;nbsp;– bin Laden and al-Zawahiri were co-signers|date=May 2009}} Former Russian [[Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation|FSB]] agent [[Alexander Litvinenko]], who was later killed, said that the FSB trained al-Zawahiri in a camp in [[Dagestan]] eight months before the 1998 ''fatwa''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Nyquist| first = J.R. | title = Is Al Qaeda a Kremlin Proxy?| work = | publisher = jrnyquist.com| date = August 13, 2005| url = http://www.jrnyquist.com/nyquist_2005_0813.htm| accessdate = 2008-04-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = Obituary: Alexander Litvinenko | publisher = BBC News| date = November 24, 2006| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/6163502.stm| accessdate = 2008-04-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Iraq===
{{main|Al-Qaeda in Iraq}}
Al-Qaeda is [[Sunni]], and often attacked the Iraqi [[Shia]] majority in an attempt to incite [[sectarian violence]] and greater chaos in the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0320/p09s01-coop.html Al Qaeda's hand in tipping Iraq toward civil war], ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]''/''[[Al-Quds Al-Arabi]]'',  March 20, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Zarqawi purportedly declared an all-out war on Shiites&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/09/15/africa/web.0915iraq.php Another wave of bombings hit Iraq]&quot;, [[Associated Press]]/''[[International Herald Tribune]]'', 15 September 2005&lt;/ref&gt; while claiming responsibility for Shiite mosque bombings.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/09/16/news/iraq.php 20 die as insurgents in Iraq target Shiites]&quot;, ''[[International Herald Tribune]]''/''[[The New York Times]]'', 17 September 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The same month, a statement claiming to be by AQI rejected as &quot;fake&quot; a letter allegedly written by al-Zawahiri, in which he appears to question the insurgents' tactic of indiscriminately attacking Shiites in Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4339912.stm Al-Qaeda disowns 'fake letter']&quot;, [[CNN]], 13 October 2005&lt;/ref&gt; In a December 2007 video, al-Zawahiri defended the Islamic State in Iraq, but distanced himself from the attacks against civilians committed by &quot;hypocrites and traitors existing among the ranks&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adnkronos.com/AKI/English/Security/?id=1.0.1678520501 |title=British 'fleeing' claims al-Qaeda |publisher=Adnkronos.com |date=2003-04-07 |accessdate=2011-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

U.S. and Iraqi officials accused AQI of trying to slide Iraq into a full-scale civil war between Iraq's majority Shiites and minority Sunni Arabs, with an orchestrated campaign of civilian massacres and a number of provocative attacks against high-profile religious targets.&lt;ref name=&quot;Insurgents&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200705/s1911670.htm Al Qaeda leader in Iraq 'killed by insurgents']&quot;, [[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]], 1 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt; With attacks such as the 2003 [[Imam Ali Mosque]] bombing, the 2004 Day of Ashura and Karbala and Najaf bombings, the 2006 [[al-Askari Mosque bombing (2006)|first al-Askari Mosque bombing]] in [[Samarra]], the deadly single-day [[23 November 2006 Sadr City bombings|series of bombings in which at least 215 people were killed]] in Baghdad's Shiite district of [[Sadr City]], and the [[2007 al-Askari Mosque bombing|second al-Askari bombing]] in 2007, they provoked Shiite militias to unleash a wave of retaliatory attacks, resulting in [[death squad]]-style killings and spiraling further sectarian violence which escalated in 2006 and brought Iraq to the brink of violent [[anarchy]] in 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;Threat&quot;&gt;DeYoung, Karen/Pincus, Walter. &quot;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/17/AR2007031701373.html Al-Qaeda in Iraq May Not Be Threat Here]&quot;, ''[[The Washington Post]]'', 18 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, sectarian bombings blamed on al-Qaeda killed [[2008 Karbala bombing|at least 42 people]] at the [[Imam Husayn Shrine]] in Karbala in March, and [[17 June 2008 Baghdad bombing|at least 51 people]] at a bus stop in Baghdad in June.

===Somalia and Yemen===
The percentage of terrorist attacks in the West originating from the Afghanistan-Pakistan ([[AfPak]]) border declined considerably from almost 100% to 75% in 2007, and to 50% in 2010, as al-Qaeda shifted to Somalia and Yemen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/terrorism-in-the-uk/8009819/Anwar-al-Awlaki-the-new-Osama-bin-Laden.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Philip | last=Johnston | title=Anwar al Awlaki: the new Osama bin Laden? | date=2010-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; While al-Qaeda leaders are hiding in the tribal areas along the AfPak border, the middle-tier of the movement display heightened activity in Somalia and Yemen.
“We know that [[South Asia]] is no longer their primary base,” a U.S. defense agency source said. “They are looking for a hide-out in other parts of the world, and continue to expand their organization.“

In Somalia, al-Qaeda agents closely collaborate with the Shahab group, actively recruit children for suicide-bomber training, and export young people to participate in military actions against Americans at the AfPak border. In January 2009, al-Qaeda’s division in Saudi Arabia merged with its Yemeni wing to form [[Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8437724.stm |title=NEWS.BBC.co.uk |publisher=NEWS.BBC.co.uk |date=2010-01-03 |accessdate=2010-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Centered in Yemen, the group takes advantage of the country's poor economy, demography and domestic security. In August 2009, they made the first assassination attempt against a member of the Saudi royal dynasty in decades.
President Obama asked his Yemen counterpart [[Ali Abdullah Saleh]] to ensure closer cooperation with the U.S. in the struggle against the growing activity of al-Qaeda in Yemen, and promised to send additional aid.
Because of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the U.S. is unable to pay sufficient attention to Somalia and Yemen, which may cause the U.S. some serious problems in the near future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.pravda.ru/hotspots/terror/109278-0/|title=Al-Qaeda Slowly Makes Its Way to Somalia and Yemen |accessdate=2009-09-23|publisher=Pravda.ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula claimed responsibility for the 2009 bombing attack on [[Northwest Airlines Flight 253]] by [[Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Font size Print E-mail Share 1 Comment |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/12/28/cbsnews_investigates/main6031295.shtml |title=CBS News Dec. 28, 2009 Al Qaeda: We Planned Flight 253 Bombing Terrorist Group Says It Was In Retaliation for U.S. Operation in Yemen; Obama Orders Reviews of Watchlist and Air Safety |publisher=Cbsnews.com |date=2009-12-28 |accessdate=2010-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group released photos of Abdulmutallab smiling in a white shirt and white Islamic skullcap, with the Al-Qaeda in Arabian Peninsula banner in the background.

===American operations===
In December 1998, the [[Director of Central Intelligence]] Counterterrorist Center reported to the president that al-Qaeda was preparing for attacks in the USA, including the training of personnel to hijack aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[File:Anwar al-Awlaki sitting on couch, lightened.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Anwar al-Awlaki]]]]

U.S. officials called Awlaki an &quot;example of al-Qaeda reach into&quot; the U.S. in 2008 after probes into his ties to the September 11 hijackers. A former FBI agent identifies Awlaki as a known &quot;senior recruiter for al-Qaeda&quot;, and a spiritual motivator.&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/al-qaeda-recruiter-focus-fort-hood-killings-investigation/story?id=9045492 Chucmach, Megan, and Ross, Brian, &quot;Al Qaeda Recruiter New Focus in Fort Hood Killings Investigation Army Major Nidal Hasan Was In Contact With Imam Anwar Awlaki, Officials Say,&quot; ''[[ABC News]]'', November 10, 2009, accessed November 12, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; Awlaki's sermons in the U.S. were attended by three of the [[September 11 attacks|9/11]] hijackers, as well as accused [[Fort Hood shooting|Fort Hood shooter]] [[Nidal Malik Hasan]]. U.S. intelligence intercepted emails from Hasan to Awlaki between December 2008 and early 2009. On his website, Awlaki has praised Hasan's actions in the Fort Hood shooting.&lt;ref name=&quot;abcnews.go.com&quot;&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/fort-hood-shooter-contact-al-qaeda-terrorists-officials/story?id=9030873 Esposito, Richard, Cole, Matthew, and Ross, Brian, &quot;Officials: U.S. Army Told of Hasan's Contacts with al Qaeda; Army Major in Fort Hood Massacre Used 'Electronic Means' to Connect with Terrorists,&quot; ''[[ABC News]]'', November 9, 2009, accessed November 12, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

An unnamed official claimed there was good reason to believe Awlaki &quot;has been involved in very serious terrorist activities since leaving the U.S. [after 9/11], including plotting attacks against America and our allies.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/02/26/AR2008022603267_pf.html WashingtonPost.com]

Al-Qaeda has carried out a total of six major terrorist attacks, four of them in its jihad against America. In each case the leadership planned the attack years in advance, arranging for the shipment of weapons and explosives and using its privatized businesses to provide operatives with safehouses and false identities.

Al-Qaeda usually does not disburse funds for attacks, and very rarely makes wire transfers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Eichenwald | first = Kurt | authorlink = Kurt Eichenwald | title = A Nation Challenged: The Money; Terror Money Hard to Block, Officials Find | work = The New York Times | date = 10 December 2001 | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/10/world/a-nation-challenged-the-money-terror-money-hard-to-block-officials-find.html?scp=1&amp;sq=A+NATION+CHALLENGED%3A+THE+MONEY%3B+Terror+Money+Hard+to+Block%2C+Officials+Find&amp;st=cse&amp;pagewanted=all| accessdate = 4 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1992===
On December 29, 1992, al-Qaeda's first terrorist attack took place as two bombs were detonated in [[Aden]], [[Yemen]]. The first target was the Movenpick Hotel and the second was the parking lot of the Goldmohur Hotel.

The bombings were an attempt to eliminate American soldiers on their way to Somalia to take part in the international famine relief effort, [[Operation Restore Hope]]. Internally, al-Qaeda considered the bombing a victory that frightened the Americans away, but in the U.S. the attack was barely noticed.

No Americans were killed because the soldiers were staying in a different hotel altogether, and they went on to Somalia as scheduled. However little noticed, the attack was pivotal as it was the beginning of al-Qaeda's change in direction, from fighting armies to killing [[civilian]]s.&lt;ref name=wright174&gt;{{Harvnb|Wright|2006|p=174}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Two people were killed in the bombing, an Australian tourist and a Yemeni hotel worker. Seven others, mostly Yemenis, were severely injured.

Two fatwas are said to have been appointed by the most theologically knowledgeable of al-Qaeda's members, [[Mamdouh Mahmud Salim]], to justify the killings according to Islamic law. Salim referred to a famous fatwa appointed by [[Ibn Taymiyyah]], a 13th-century scholar much admired by Wahhabis, which sanctioned resistance by any means during the Mongol invasions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jansen|1997}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify credibility|date=September 2009}}

===1993 World Trade Center bombing===
[[File:Ramzi Yousef.gif|thumb|upright|[[Ramzi Yousef]]]]
{{Main|World Trade Center bombing}}

In 1993, [[Ramzi Yousef]] used a truck bomb to attack the [[World Trade Center]] in New York City. The attack was intended to break the foundation of Tower One knocking it into Tower Two, bringing the entire complex down.

Yousef hoped this would kill 250,000 people. The towers shook and swayed but the foundation held and he succeeded in killing only six people (although he injured 1,042 others and caused nearly $300 million in property damage).&lt;ref name=yousef&gt;{{Harvnb|Wright|2006|p=178}}; {{Harvnb|Reeve|1999}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=miis&gt;{{cite web

After the attack, Yousef fled to Pakistan and later moved to [[Manila]]. There he began developing the [[Bojinka Plot]] plans to implode a dozen American airliners simultaneously, to assassinate Pope [[John Paul II]] and President [[Bill Clinton]], and to crash a private plane into CIA headquarters. He was later captured in Pakistan.&lt;ref name=yousef/&gt;

None of the U.S. government's indictments against bin Laden have suggested that he had any connection with this bombing, but Ramzi Yousef is known to have attended a terrorist training camp in Afghanistan. After his capture, Yousef declared that his primary justification for the attack was to punish the U.S. for its support for the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories and made no mention of any religious motivations.&lt;ref name=miis/&gt;

In 1996, bin Laden personally engineered a plot to assassinate Clinton while the president was in [[Manila]] for the [[Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation]]. However, intelligence agents intercepted a message just minutes before the motorcade was to leave, and alerted the [[U.S. Secret Service]]. Agents later discovered a bomb planted under a bridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Osama bin Laden came within minutes of killing Bill Clinton  |author=Tom Leonard |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=2009-12-25 |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/philippines/6867331/Osama-bin-Laden-came-within-minutes-of-killing-Bill-Clinton.html |accessdate=2009-12-25 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[1998 U.S. embassy bombings]] in East Africa, resulting in upward of 300 deaths, mostly locals. A barrage of [[cruise missile]]s launched by the U.S. military in response devastated an al-Qaeda base in [[Khost]], Afghanistan, but the network's capacity was unharmed.

In October 2000, al-Qaeda militants in [[Yemen]] bombed the missile [[destroyer]] ''[[USS Cole bombing|U.S.S. Cole]]'' in a suicide attack, killing 17 U.S. servicemen and damaging the vessel while it lay offshore. Inspired by the success of such a brazen attack, al-Qaeda's command core began to prepare for an attack on the U.S. itself.

===September 11, 2001 attacks===
{{Main|September 11 attacks}}
{{See also|Responsibility for the September 11 attacks}}
[[Image:September 17 2001 Ground Zero 01.jpg|thumb|upright|Aftermath of the September 11 attacks]]
The September 11, 2001, attacks were the most devastating terrorist acts in American history, killing approximately 3,000 people. Two commercial airliners were deliberately flown into the [[World Trade Center]] towers, a third into [[The Pentagon]], and a fourth, originally intended to target the [[U.S. Capitol]], crashed in a field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.

The attacks were conducted by al-Qaeda, acting in accord with the [[Fatāwā of Osama bin Laden#1998 Fatwa|1998 ''fatwa'']] issued against the U.S. and its allies by military forces under the command of bin Laden, al-Zawahiri, and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fas.org/irp/world/para/docs/980223-fatwa.htm|title=Jihad Against Jews and Crusaders| accessdate=2010-06-16| date=February 23, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence points to suicide squads led by al-Qaeda military commander [[Mohamed Atta]] as the culprits of the attacks, with bin Laden, Ayman al-Zawahiri, [[Khalid Shaikh Mohammed]], and [[Hambali]] as the key planners and part of the political and military command.

Messages issued by bin Laden after September 11, 2001, praised the attacks, and explained their motivation while denying any involvement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2001/US/09/16/inv.binladen.denial/| title=Bin Laden says he wasn't behind attacks| publisher=CNN| accessdate=2006-07-06| date=September 17, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bin Laden legitimized the attacks by identifying grievances felt by both mainstream and Islamist Muslims, such as the general perception that the U.S. was actively oppressing Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Esposito|2002|p=22}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bin Laden asserted that America was massacring Muslims in '[[Palestinian National Authority|Palestine]], [[Chechnya]], [[Kashmir]] and [[Iraq]]' and that Muslims should retain the 'right to attack in reprisal'. He also claimed the 9/11 attacks were not targeted at women and children, but 'America's icons of military and economic power'.&lt;ref&gt;Hamid Miir 'Osama claims he has nukes: If U.S. uses N-arms it will get the same response' &quot;Dawn: the Internet Edition&quot; November 10, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence has since come to light that the original targets for the attack may have been nuclear power stations on the east coast of the U.S. The targets were later altered by al-Qaeda, as it was feared that such an attack &quot;might get out of hand&quot;.&lt;ref name=AL-QAIDA-LEADERS-SAY-NUCLEAR-POWER-STATIONS-WERE-ORIGINAL-TARGETS&gt;{{Cite news

==War on Terrorism==
{{Main|War on Terror}}
In the immediate aftermath of the attacks, the U.S. government [[Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists|decided to respond militarily]], and began to prepare its [[Military of the United States|armed forces]] to overthrow the Taliban regime it believed was harboring al-Qaeda. Before the U.S. attacked, it offered Taliban leader [[Mohammed Omar|Mullah Omar]] a chance to surrender bin Laden and his top associates. The first forces to be inserted into Afghanistan were Paramilitary Officers from the CIA's elite [[Special Activities Division]] (SAD).

The [[Taliban]] offered to turn over bin Laden to a [[neutral country]] for trial if the U.S. would provide evidence of bin Laden's complicity in the attacks. [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[George W. Bush]] responded by saying: &quot;We know he's guilty. Turn him over&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seacoastonline.com/2001news/10_15_w1.htm| title=U.S. Jets Pound Targets Around Kabul| work=[[The Portsmouth Herald]]| date=October 15, 2001|accessdate=2006-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and British Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] warned the Taliban regime: &quot;Surrender bin Laden, or surrender power&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2001/10/02/blair_war011002.html |title=Blair to Taliban: Surrender bin Laden or surrender power |publisher=Cbc.ca |date=2001-10-03 |accessdate=2010-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon thereafter the U.S. and its allies invaded Afghanistan, and together with the [[Northern Alliance|Afghan Northern Alliance]] removed the Taliban government in the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|war in Afghanistan]].

[[Image:Anaconda-helicopter.jpg|thumb|left|U.S. troops in Afghanistan]]
As a result of the U.S. using its [[special forces]] and providing [[close air support|air support]] for the [[Northern Alliance]] [[infantry|ground forces]], both [[Taliban]] and [[Derunta training camp|al-Qaeda training camps]] were destroyed, and much of the operating structure of al-Qaeda is believed to have been disrupted. After being driven from their key positions in the [[Tora Bora]] area of [[Afghanistan]], many al-Qaeda fighters tried to regroup in the rugged [[Gardez]] region of the nation.

Again, under the cover of intense [[aerial bombing of cities|aerial bombardment]], U.S. [[infantry]] and local Afghan forces attacked, shattering the al-Qaeda position and killing or capturing many of the militants. By early 2002, al-Qaeda had been dealt a serious blow to its operational capacity, and the Afghan invasion appeared an initial success. Nevertheless, a significant [[Taliban insurgency]] remains in [[Afghanistan]], and al-Qaeda's top two leaders, bin Laden and al-Zawahiri, evaded capture.

Debate raged about the exact nature of al-Qaeda's role in the 9/11 attacks, and after the U.S. invasion began, the [[United States State Department|U.S. State Department]] also released a [[Videos of Osama bin Laden#December 13, 2001|videotape]] showing bin Laden speaking with a small group of associates somewhere in Afghanistan shortly before the Taliban was removed from power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defenselink.mil/releases/2001/b12132001_bt630-01.html| title=U.S. Releases Videotape of Osama Bin Laden| accessdate=2006-07-04| date=December 13, 2001| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060625223529/http://www.defenselink.mil/releases/2001/b12132001_bt630-01.html| archivedate = June 25, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although its authenticity has been questioned by some,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/september11/story/0,11209,619188,00.html| author=Morris, Steven| title=US urged to detail origin of tape| publisher=The Guardian| accessdate=2006-07-11| date=December 15, 2001 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; the tape appears to implicate bin Laden and al-Qaeda in the September 11 attacks and was aired on many [[television channels]] all over the world, with an accompanying [http://archives.cnn.com/2001/US/12/13/tape.transcript/ English translation] provided by the [[U.S. Defense Department]].

In September 2004, the US government [[9/11 Commission]] investigating the September 11 attacks officially concluded that the attacks were conceived and implemented by al-Qaeda operatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.9-11commission.gov/| title=National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States| accessdate=2006-04-27| date=September 20, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2004, bin Laden appeared to claim responsibility for the attacks in a [[2004 Osama bin Laden video|videotape]] released through Al Jazeera, saying he was inspired by Israeli attacks on [[high-rise]]s in the 1982 [[1982 Lebanon War|invasion of Lebanon]]: &quot;As I looked at those demolished towers in [[Lebanon]], it entered my mind that we should punish the oppressor in kind and that we should destroy towers in America in order that they taste some of what we tasted and so that they be deterred from killing our women and children.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/79C6AF22-98FB-4A1C-B21F-2BC36E87F61F.htm| title=Full transcript of bin Ladin's speech| publisher=Al Jazeera| accessdate=2006-07-12| date=November 1, 2004}}{{dead link|date=May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of 2004, the U.S. government proclaimed that two-thirds of the most senior al-Qaeda figures from 2001 had been captured and interrogated by the CIA: [[Abu Zubaydah]], [[Ramzi bin al-Shibh]] and [[Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri]] in 2002;&lt;ref name=&quot;martinez interrogations&quot;&gt;{{Cite news| last = Shane | first = Scott | title = Inside the interrogation of a 9/11 mastermind | work = The New York Times | date = 2008-06-22 | pages = A1, A12–A13 | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/22/washington/22ksm.html | accessdate = 2009-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Khalid Sheikh Mohammed]] in 2003; and [[Saif al Islam el Masry]] in 2004.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} [[Mohammed Atef]] and several others were killed. &lt;!-- Despite this, the U.S. government continues to warn that the organization is not yet defeated and battles between U.S. forces and al-Qaeda-related groups continue.

[[Al-Qaeda involvement in Africa]] has included a number of bombing attacks in [[North Africa]], as well as supporting parties in civil wars in [[Eritrea]] and [[Somalia]]. From 1991 to 1996, bin Laden and other al-Qaeda leaders were based in [[Sudan]].

Some had previously met Bin Laden, and though they specifically declined to pledge allegiance to al-Qaeda they asked for its blessing and help.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=View all comments that have been posted about this article. |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/12/AR2007021201715_pf.html |title=Washington Post&amp;nbsp;– Al-Qaeda's Hand In Istanbul Plot |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=8:51 a.m. ET |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3735645/ |title=Msn News&amp;nbsp;– Bin Laden allegedly planned attack in Turkey&amp;nbsp;– Stymied by tight security at U.S. bases, militants switched targets |publisher=MSNBC |date=2003-12-17 |accessdate=2010-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, three Londoners, [[Tanvir Hussain]], [[Assad Sarwar]] and [[Ahmed Abdullah Ali]], were convicted of conspiring to detonate bombs disguised as soft drinks on seven airplanes bound for Canada and the U.S. The massively complex police and [[MI5]] investigation of the plot involved more than a year of surveillance work conducted by over two hundred officers.&lt;ref&gt;

In [[Iraq]], al-Qaeda forces loosely associated with the leadership were embedded in the [[Jama'at al-Tawhid wal-Jihad]] organization commanded by [[Abu Musab al-Zarqawi]].

Significantly, it was not until the late 1990s that al-Qaeda began training Palestinians. This is not to suggest that resistance fighters are underrepresented in the network as a number of Palestinians, mostly coming from Jordan, wanted to join and have risen to serve high-profile roles in Afghanistan.&lt;ref name=&quot;palestinian operatives&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Gunaratna|2002|p=150}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Rather, large groups such as [[Hamas]] and [[Palestinian Islamic Jihad]]—which cooperate with al-Qaeda in many respects—have had difficulties accepting a strategic alliance, fearing that al-Qaeda will co-opt their smaller cells. This may have changed recently, as Israeli security and intelligence services believe al-Qaeda has managed to infiltrate operatives from the Occupied Territories into Israel, and is waiting for the right time to mount an attack.&lt;ref name=&quot;palestinian operatives&quot;/&gt;

Bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri consider India to be a part of the ‘Crusader-Zionist-Hindu’ conspiracy against the Islamic world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brookings.edu/articles/2008/1130_india_terrorism_riedel.aspx Terrorism in India and the Global Jihad], [[Brookings Institution]], 2008-11-30&lt;/ref&gt; According to the 2005 report 'Al Qaeda: Profile and Threat Assessment' by [[Congressional Research Service]], bin Laden was involved in training militants for Jihad in Kashmir while living in Sudan in the early nineties.

Many of the militants active in Kashmir were trained in the same [[Madrasah]]s as [[Taliban]] and al-Qaeda.

Timothy L. Thomas claims that in the wake of its evacuation from Afghanistan, al-Qaeda and its successors have migrated online to escape detection in an atmosphere of increased international vigilance. As a result, the organization's use of the Internet has grown more sophisticated, encompassing financing, recruitment, networking, mobilization, publicity, as well as information dissemination, gathering and sharing.&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Thomas, [http://www.carlisle.army.mil/usawc/Parameters/03spring/thomas.pdf &quot;Al Qaeda and the Internet: The Danger of Cyberplanning&quot;].

[[Abu Ayyub al-Masri]]’s al-Qaeda movement in [[Iraq]] regularly releases short videos glorifying the activity of jihadist suicide bombers. In addition, both before and after the death of [[Abu Musab al-Zarqawi]] (the former leader of [[al-Qaeda in Iraq]]), the umbrella organization to which al-Qaeda in Iraq belongs, the [[Mujahideen Shura Council (Iraq)|Mujahideen Shura Council]], has a regular [[web presence|presence on the Web]].
The range of multimedia content includes guerrilla training clips, stills of victims about to be murdered, testimonials of suicide bombers, and videos that show participation in jihad through stylized portraits of mosques and musical scores. A website associated with al-Qaeda posted a video of captured American entrepreneur [[Nick Berg]] being decapitated in Iraq. Other decapitation videos and pictures, including those of [[Paul Johnson (hostage)|Paul Johnson]], [[Kim Sun-il]], and [[Daniel Pearl]], were first posted on jihadist websites.

In December 2004 an audio message claiming to be from Bin Laden was posted directly to a website, rather than sending a copy to [[Aljazeera|al Jazeera]] as he had done in the past.

Al-Qaeda turned to the Internet for release of its videos in order to be certain it would be available unedited, rather than risk the possibility of al Jazeera editors editing the videos and cutting out anything critical of the [[Saudi royal family]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jamestown.org/terrorism/news/article.php?articleid=2373884 |title=Bin Laden Identifies Saudi Arabia as the Enemy of Mujahideen Unity |author=Scheuer, Michael |month=January | year=2008 |work=Terrorism Focus |publisher=Jamestown Foundation}}{{dead link|date=May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bin Laden's December 2004 message was much more vehement than usual in this speech, lasting over an hour.

In the past, [[Alneda|Alneda.com]] and [[Jehad.net]] were perhaps the most significant al-Qaeda websites. Alneda was initially taken down by American [[Jon Messner]], but the operators resisted by shifting the site to various servers and strategically shifting content.

The U.S. is currently attempting to extradite a British information technology specialist, [[Babar Ahmad]], on charges of operating a network of English-language al-Qaeda websites, such as Azzam.com.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Whitlock | first = Craig | authorlink = Craig Whitlock | title = Briton Used Internet As His Bully Pulpit | work = The Washington Post | date = 2005-08-08 | page = A1 | url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/08/07/AR2005080700890.html | accessdate=2009-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Babar Ahmad Indicted on Terrorism Charges | publisher = United States Attorney's Office District of Connecticut | date = 2004-10-06 | url=http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/ct/Press2004/20041006.html|accessdate=2006-05-29| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060526115318/http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/ct/Press2004/20041006.html| archivedate = May 26, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ahmad's extradition is opposed by various British Muslim organizations, such as the [[Muslim Association of Britain]].

===Aviation network===
Al-Qaeda is believed to be operating a clandestine [[aviation]] network including “several [[Boeing 727]] aircraft”, [[turboprops]] and [[executive jet]]s, according to a [[Reuters]] story. Based on a U.S. [[Department of Homeland Security]] report, the story said that al-Qaeda is possibly using aircraft to transport drugs and weapons from South America to various unstable countries in [[West Africa]]. A Boeing 727 can carry up to 10 tons of cargo. The drugs eventually are smuggled to Europe for distribution and sale, and the weapons are used in conflicts in Africa and possibly elsewhere. Gunmen with links to al-Qaeda have been increasingly [[kidnapping]] some Europeans for ransom. The profits from the drug and weapon sales, and kidnappings can, in turn, fund more terrorism activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gaynor |first=Tim |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE60C3E820100113?type=politicsNews |title=Al Qaeda linked to rogue aviation network |publisher=Reuters |date= 2010-01-13|accessdate=2011-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alleged CIA involvement==
{{Main|Allegations of CIA assistance to Osama bin Laden}} Experts debate whether or not the al-Qaeda attacks were [[blowback (intelligence)|blowback]] from the American CIA's &quot;[[Operation Cyclone]]&quot; program to help the Afghan [[Islamic mujahid movement|mujahideen]]. [[Robin Cook]], British Foreign Secretary from 1997 to 2001, has written that al-Qaeda and Bin Laden were &quot;a product of a monumental miscalculation by western security agencies&quot;, and that &quot;Al-Qaida, literally &quot;the database&quot;, was originally the computer file of the thousands of mujahideen who were recruited and trained with help from the CIA to defeat the Russians.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/terrorism/story/0,12780,1523838,00.html|title=The struggle against terrorism cannot be won by military means|author=Cook, Robin|publisher=Guardian Unlimited|accessdate=2005-07-08 | location=London | date=2005-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Munir Akram]], [[Permanent Representative of Pakistan to the United Nations]] from 2002 to 2008, wrote in a letter published in the [[New York Times]] on January 19, 2008:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The strategy to support the Afghans against Soviet military intervention was evolved by several intelligence agencies, including the C.I.A. and Inter-Services Intelligence, or ISI. After the Soviet withdrawal, the Western powers walked away from the region, leaving behind 40,000 militants imported from several countries to wage the anti-Soviet jihad. Pakistan was left to face the blowback of extremism, drugs and guns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/19/opinion/lweb22pakistan.html?_r=1&amp;ref=opinion
|accessdate=2009-10-17

|section=Opinion

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A variety of sources—[[CNN]] journalist [[Peter Bergen]], [[Inter-Services Intelligence|Pakistani ISI]] Brigadier Mohammad Yousaf, and CIA operatives involved in the Afghan program, such as [[Vincent Cannistraro]]—deny that the CIA or other American officials had contact with the foreign mujahideen or Bin Laden, let alone armed, trained, coached or indoctrinated them.

This runs counter to the account of [[Milton Bearden]], the CIA Field Officer for Afghanistan from 1985 to 1989, who distinctly recalls the unease he used to feel when meeting the Jihadi fighters: &quot;The only times that I ran into any real trouble in Afghanistan was when I ran into 'these guys'&amp;nbsp;– You know there'd be kind of a 'moment' or two that would look a little bit like the bar scene in Star Wars, ya know. Each group kinda jockeying around and finally somebody has to {{sic|diffuse}} the situation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''The Power of Nightmares'', part 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

But Bergen and others argue that there was no need to recruit foreigners unfamiliar with the local language, customs or lay of the land since there were a quarter of a million local Afghans willing to fight;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Coll|2005|pp=145–146, 155–156}}.&lt;/ref&gt; that foreign mujahideen themselves had no need for American funds since they received several hundred million dollars a year from non-American, Muslim sources; that Americans could not have trained mujahideen because Pakistani officials would not allow more than a handful of them to operate in Pakistan and none in Afghanistan; and that the Afghan Arabs were almost invariably militant Islamists reflexively hostile to Westerners whether or not the Westerners were helping the Muslim Afghans.

According to [[Peter Bergen]], known for conducting the first television interview with bin Laden in 1997, the idea that &quot;the CIA funded bin Laden or trained bin Laden ...[is] a folk myth. There's no evidence of this. ... Bin Laden had his own money, he was anti-American and he was operating secretly and independently. ... The real story here is the CIA didn't really have a clue about who this guy was until 1996 when they set up a unit to really start tracking him.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/asiapcf/08/15/bergen.answers/index.html|title= Bergen: Bin Laden, CIA links hogwash|author=Bergen, Peter|publisher=CNN|accessdate=2006-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; But as Bergen himself admitted, in one &quot;strange incident&quot; the CIA ''did'' appear to give visa help to [[mujahideen]]-recruiter [[Omar Abdel-Rahman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bergen|2001|pp=72–73}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
According to a number of sources there has been a &quot;wave of revulsion&quot; against al-Qaeda and its affiliates by &quot;religious scholars, former fighters and militants&quot; alarmed by al-Qaeda's [[takfir]] and killing of Muslims in Muslim countries, especially Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bergen|Cruickshank|2008}}; {{Harvnb|Wright|2008}}. Quotes taken from {{Harvnb|Riedel|2008|pp=106–107}} and {{Harvnb|Bergen|Cruickshank|2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Noman Benotman]], a former Afghan Arab and militant of the [[Libyan Islamic Fighting Group]], went public with an open letter of criticism to Ayman al-Zawahiri in November 2007 after persuading imprisoned senior leadership of his former group to enter into peace negotiations with the Libyan regime. While Ayman al-Zawahiri announced the affiliation of the group with al-Qaeda in November 2007, the Libyan government released 90 members of the group from prison several months later after &quot;they were said to have renounced violence.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/AA64F530-BCA8-40B0-8226-22154CCD1032.htm |title=Libya releases scores of prisoners APRIL 9, 2008 |publisher=English.aljazeera.net |date=2008-04-09 |accessdate=2010-03-22}}{{dead link|date=May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, around the sixth anniversary of September 11 and a couple of months before ''Rationalizing Jihad'' first appeared in the newspapers,&lt;ref name=&quot;RebellionWright&quot;/&gt; the Saudi sheikh [[Salman al-Ouda]] delivered a personal rebuke to bin Laden. [[Salman al-Ouda|Al-Ouda]], a religious scholar and one of the fathers of the Sahwa, the fundamentalist awakening movement that swept through Saudi Arabia in the 1980s, is a widely respected critic of jihadism.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} Al-Ouda addressed al-Qaeda's leader on television asking him
&lt;blockquote&gt;My brother Osama, how much blood has been spilt? How many innocent people, children, elderly, and women have been killed ... in the name of al-Qaeda? Will you be happy to meet God Almighty carrying the burden of these hundreds of thousands or millions [of victims] on your back?&lt;ref name=theunraveling&gt;{{Harvnb|Bergen|Cruickshank|2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Pew polls, support for al-Qaeda has been dropping around the Muslim world in the years leading to 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2008/05/taking_stock_in_the_war_on_ter.html |title=Taking Stock of the War on Terror |publisher=Realclearpolitics.com |date=2008-05-22 |accessdate=2010-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The numbers supporting suicide bombings in Indonesia, Lebanon, and Bangladesh, for instance, have dropped by half or more in the last five years. In Saudi Arabia, only 10&amp;nbsp;percent now have a favorable view of al-Qaeda, according to a December poll by Terror Free Tomorrow, a Washington-based [[think tank]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/meast/12/17/saudi.poll/index.html |title=December 18, 2007 Poll: Most Saudis oppose al Qaeda |publisher=Cnn.com |date= 2007-12-18|accessdate=2010-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the imprisoned [[Sayyed Imam Al-Sharif]], an influential Afghan Arab, &quot;ideological godfather of al-Qaeda&quot;, and former supporter of takfir, sensationally withdrew his support from al-Qaeda with a book ''[[Sayyed Imam Al-Sharif#Rationalizing Jihad in Egypt and the World|Wathiqat Tarshid Al-'Aml Al-Jihadi fi Misr w'Al-'Alam]]'' (''Rationalizing Jihad in Egypt and the World'').

Although once associated with al-Qaeda, in September 2009 [[Libyan Islamic Fighting Group|LIFG]] completed a new &quot;code&quot; for jihad, a 417-page religious document entitled &quot;Corrective Studies&quot;. Given its credibility and the fact that several other prominent Jihadists in the Middle East have turned against al-Qaeda, the LIFG's about face may be an important step toward staunching al-Qaeda's recruitment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/africa/11/09/libya.jihadi.code/ New jihad code threatens al Qaeda], Nic Robertson and Paul Cruickshank, ''[[CNN]]'', November 10, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Count]] Alessandro Giuseppe Antonio Anastasio Volta''' ([[Como]] 18 February 1745 &amp;ndash; Como 5 March 1827) was an [[Italian people|Italian]]&lt;ref name = &quot;wmnqsy&quot;&gt;Giuliano Pancaldi, ''&quot;Volta: Science and culture in the age of enlightenment&quot;'', Princeton University Press, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;nxukip&quot;&gt;Alberto Gigli Berzolari, ''&quot;Volta's Teaching in Como and Pavia&quot;''- Nuova voltiana&lt;/ref&gt; [[Physics|physicist]] known especially for the invention of the [[Battery (electricity)|battery]] in 1800.

==Early life and works==
&lt;!-- Unsourced image

Volta was born in Como, Italy, and taught in the public schools there. In 1774 he became a physics professor at the Royal School in Como. A year later, he improved and popularized the [[electrophorus]], a device that produces a static electric charge. His promotion of it was so extensive that he is often credited with its invention, even though a machine operating in the same principle was described in 1762 by Swedish professor [[Johan Wilcke]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pancaldi|first=Giuliano|year= 2003|title=Volta, Science and Culture in the Age of Enlightenment|publisher=Princeton Univ. Press|url=http://books.google.com/?id=hGoYB1Twx4sC&amp;pg=PA73|isbn=978-0-691-12226-7}}, p.73&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1776-77 Volta studied the [[chemistry]] of [[gas]]es. He discovered [[methane]] by collecting the gas from marshes. He devised experiments such as the [[combustion|ignition]] of methane by an electric [[Electrostatic discharge|spark]] in a closed vessel. Volta also studied what we now call electrical [[capacitance]], developing separate means to study both electrical potential (''V'') and charge (''Q''), and discovering that for a given object they are proportional. This may be called Volta's Law of capacitance, and likely for this work the unit of electrical potential has been named the [[Volt]].

In 1779 he became professor of experimental physics at the [[University of Pavia]], a chair he occupied for almost 25 years. In 1794, Volta married Teresa Peregrini, with whom he raised three sons, Giovanni, Flaminio and Zanino.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Munro, John|title=Pioneers of Electricity; Or, Short Lives of the Great Electricians|year=1902|publisher=The Religious Tract Society| location = London|pages=89 – 102|url=http://www.archive.org/details/pioneerselectri00munrgoog}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Volta and Galvani==
The &quot;animal electricity&quot; noted by [[Luigi Galvani]] when two different metals were connected in series with the frog's leg and to one another. Volta realized that the frog's leg served as both a conductor of electricity (we would now call it an [[electrolyte]]) and as a detector of electricity. He replaced the frog's leg with brine-soaked paper, and detected the flow of electricity by other means familiar to him from his previous studies. In this way he discovered the [[electrochemical series]], and the law that the [[electromotive force]] (emf) of a [[galvanic cell]], consisting of a pair of metal [[electrode]]s separated by electrolyte, is the difference between their two electrode potentials (thus, two identical electrodes and a common electrolyte give zero net emf). This may be called Volta's Law of the electrochemical series.

In 1800, as the result of a professional disagreement over the galvanic response advocated by Galvani, he invented the [[voltaic pile]], an early [[Battery (electricity)|electric battery]], which produced a steady electric current.&lt;ref name=Routledge&gt;{{cite book|title=A popular history of science|author=Robert Routledge|url=http://books.google.com/?id=VO1HAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA553|page=553 |edition=2nd|year=1881|publisher=G. Routledge and Sons|isbn=0-415-38381-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Volta had determined that the most effective pair of dissimilar metals to produce electricity was [[zinc]] and [[silver]]. Initially he experimented with individual cells in series, each cell being a wine goblet filled with [[brine]] into which the two dissimilar electrodes were dipped. The voltaic pile replaced the goblets with cardboard soaked in brine.

==First battery==
In announcing his discovery of the pile, Volta paid tribute to the influences of [[William Nicholson (chemist)|William Nicholson]], [[Tiberius Cavallo]] and [[Abraham Bennet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Elliott, P.|title=Abraham Bennet F.R.S. (1749-1799): a provincial electrician in eighteenth-century England|journal=Notes and Records of the Royal Society of London| volume=53|issue=1|pages=59–78|year=1999|url=http://www.journals.royalsoc.ac.uk/content/klgdd0umcmvjqnpr/fulltext.pdf|format=PDF| doi=10.1098/rsnr.1999.0063}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An additional invention pioneered by Volta, was the remotely operated pistol. He made use of a [[Leyden jar]] to send an electric current from [[Como]] to [[Milan]] (~50&amp;nbsp;km or ~30 miles), which in turn, set off the pistol. The current was sent along a wire that was insulated from the ground by wooden boards. This invention was a significant forerunner of the idea of the telegraph which also makes use of a current to communicate.&lt;ref&gt;http://chem.ch.huji.ac.il/history/volta.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:VoltaBattery.JPG|thumb|right|Voltaic battery]]

The battery made by Volta is credited as the first electrochemical cell. It consists of two electrodes: one made of [[zinc]], the other of [[copper]]. The [[electrolyte]] is [[sulfuric acid]] or a brine mixture of salt and water. The electrolyte exists in the form 2H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt;. The zinc, which is higher than both copper and hydrogen in the electrochemical series, reacts with the negatively charged sulfate (SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt;). The positively charged hydrogen ions ([[proton]]s) capture [[electron]]s from the copper, forming bubbles of hydrogen gas, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. This makes the zinc rod the negative electrode and the copper rod the positive electrode.

We now have two terminals, and the current will flow if we connect them. The reactions in this cell are as follows:

:zinc
: Zn &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;→&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; + 2e&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;

:sulfuric acid
: 2H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + 2e&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;→&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

The copper does not react, functioning as an electrode for the chemical reaction.

However, this cell also has some disadvantages. It is unsafe to handle, as sulfuric acid, even if dilute, is dangerous. Also, the power of the cell diminishes over time because the hydrogen gas is not released, accumulating instead on the surface of the zinc electrode and forming a barrier between the metal and the electrolyte solution.

The primitive cell is widely used in schools to demonstrate the laws of electricity and is known as the [[lemon battery]].

==Last years and retirement==
In honor of his work, Volta was made a count by [[Napoleon]] in 1810. Furthermore, he was depicted upon the [[Italian lira|Italian 10,000 Lire]] (no longer in circulation) along with a sketch of his famous Voltaic Pile.

Volta retired in 1819 in his estate in Camnago, a [[frazione]] of Como now called Camnago Volta after him, where he died on March 5, 1827.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chem.ch.huji.ac.il/history/volta.htm#end|title=Volta|publisher=Institute of Chemistry - Jerusalem|accessdate=2009-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is buried in Camnago Volta.&lt;ref&gt;For a photograph of his gravesite, and other Volta locales, see {{cite web|title=Volta's localities|url=http://www.corrieredicomo.it/pg_interna.cfm?IndiceID=526&amp;MenuID=2|accessdate= 2009-06-20}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Volta's legacy is celebrated by a [[Tempio Voltiano|Temple]] located in the public gardens by the lake. It is also a  museum which has been built in his honor and exhibits some of the original equipment he used to conduct experiments; not far away stands the [[Villa Olmo]], which houses the Voltian Foundation, an organization promoting scientific activities. Volta carried out his experimental studies and made his first inventions in Como.

==Possible earlier batteries==
[[Image:Ironie pile Bagdad.jpg|thumb|right|Drawing of the baghdad battery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unexplained-mysteries.com/gallery/images/1854/baghdad-battery |title=Paranormal Image Gallery - Ancient Mysteries/Aztec carving of ancient astronaut |publisher=Unexplained Mysteries |date= |accessdate=2009-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Recently there is a growing dispute over the invention of the battery. It has been suggested that the [[Baghdad battery]] discovered by [[Wilhelm Konig]] in 1938 at Khujut Rabu near [[Baghdad]] has priority. The Baghdad battery may have been used by [[Persia|Persian]]s some 2000 years ago for electroplating and may be the first known chemical battery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unmuseum.org/bbattery.htm The Baghdad Battery, The Museum of UnNatural Mystery]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-mysteries.com/sar_11.htm World Mysteries.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Argo Navis''' (or simply '''Argo''') was a large [[constellation]] in the southern sky that has since been divided into three constellations. It represented the ''[[Argo]]'', the ship used by [[Jason]] and the [[Argonauts]] in [[Greek mythology]].  The abbreviation was &quot;Arg&quot; and the genitive was &quot;Argus Navis&quot;.

Argo Navis is the only one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd century astronomer [[Ptolemy]] that is no longer officially recognised as a constellation. It was unwieldy due to its enormous size: were it still considered a single constellation, it would be the largest of all. In 1752, the French astronomer [[Nicolas Louis de Lacaille]] subdivided it into [[Carina (constellation)|Carina]] (the [[keel]], or the hull, of the ship), [[Puppis]] (the [[poop deck]]), and [[Vela (constellation)|Vela]] (the [[sail]]s). When Argo Navis was split, its [[Bayer designation]]s were also split. Carina has the α, β and ε, Vela has γ and δ, Puppis has ζ, and so on.

The constellation [[Pyxis]] (the [[mariner's compass]]) occupies an area which in antiquity was considered part of Argo's mast (called [[Malus (constellation)|Malus]]). However, Pyxis is not now considered part of Argo Navis, and its Bayer designations are separate from those of Carina, Puppis and Vela.

'''Andromeda''' is a [[princess]] from [[Greek mythology]] who, as divine punishment for her mother's bragging, the ''Boast of Cassiopeia'', was chained to a rock as a sacrifice to a [[sea monster]]. She was saved from death by  [[Perseus]], her future husband. Her name is the [[Latin language|Latinized]] form of the Greek Ἀνδρομέδη (''Andromédē'').  The traditional [[etymology]] of the name is &quot;to think of a man,&quot; from [[wikt:ἀνήρ|ἀνήρ]], ἀνδρός (''anēr, andrós'') &quot;man&quot; combined with μήδομαι (''mēdomai'') &quot;to think, to be mindful of.&quot;

The subject has been popular in art since classical times.  In the Christian period the subject was converted into the legend of [[St George and the Dragon]], but from the [[Renaissance]] interest revived in the original story, typically as derived from [[Ovid]]'s account.

== Mythology ==
[[Image:Vasari, perseo e andromeda, studiolo.jpg|thumb|left|[[Giorgio Vasari]], ''Perseus and Andromeda'', 1570]]
In [[Greek mythology]], Andromeda was the daughter of [[Cepheus, King of Aethiopia|Cepheus]] and [[Cassiopeia (mythology)|Cassiopeia]], king and queen of the kingdom [[Ethiopia (mythology)|Ethiopia]].

Her mother Cassiopeia boasted that she was more beautiful than the [[Nereids]], the [[nymph]]-daughters of the sea god [[Nereus]] and often seen accompanying [[Poseidon]]. To punish the Queen for her arrogance, Poseidon, brother to [[Zeus]] and god of the sea, sent a sea monster named [[Cetus (mythology)|Cetus]] to ravage the coast of Ethiopia including the kingdom of the vain Queen. The desperate King consulted the [[Oracle]] of Apollo, who announced that no respite would be found until the king sacrificed his virgin daughter Andromeda to the monster. She was chained naked to a rock on the coast.

[[Perseus (mythology)|Perseus]] was returning from having slain the [[Gorgon]] [[Medusa]],  he found Andromeda and slew Cetus by approaching invisible with Hades's helm and slaying him. He set her free, and married her in spite of Andromeda having been previously promised to her uncle Phineus. At the wedding a quarrel took place between the rivals, and Phineus was turned to stone by the sight of the Gorgon's head ([[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses (poem)|Metamorphoses]]'' v. 1).

Andromeda followed her husband to [[Tiryns]] in [[Argos]], and together they became the ancestors of the family of the ''Perseidae'' through the line of their son Perses.  Perseus and Andromeda had seven sons: [[Perseides]], [[Perses (son of Andromeda and Perseus)|Perses]], [[Alcaeus (mythology)|Alcaeus]], [[Heleus]], [[Mestor]], [[Sthenelus (son of Andromeda and Perseus)|Sthenelus]], and [[Electryon]], and two daughters, [[Autochthoe]] and [[Gorgophone]].  Their descendants ruled Mycenae from [[Electryon]] down to [[Eurystheus]], after whom [[Atreus]] attained the kingdom, and would also include the great hero [[Heracles]]. According to this mythology, Perseus is the ancestor of the [[Persian people|Persians]].

After her death, Andromeda was placed by [[Athena]] amongst the [[constellation]]s in the northern sky, near Perseus and [[Cassiopeia (constellation)|Cassiopeia]]. The [[Andromeda (constellation)|constellation]] had been named after her.

==Constellations ==
[[File:Corinthian Vase depicting Perseus, Andromeda and Ketos.jpg|thumb|Vase from [[Ancient Corinth]].]]
Andromeda is represented in the northern sky by the [[constellation]] [[Andromeda (constellation)|Andromeda]] which contains the [[Andromeda Galaxy]].

Four constellations are associated with the myth. Viewing the fainter stars, visible to the naked eye, the constellations are rendered as:
*A large man wearing a [[Crown (headgear)|crown]], upside down with respect to the [[ecliptic]] (the constellation [[Cepheus (constellation)|Cepheus]]).
*A smaller figure, next to the man, sitting on a chair. As it is near the [[Polaris|pole star]], it can be seen by observers in the Northern Hemisphere through the whole year, although sometimes upside down (the constellation [[Cassiopeia (constellation)|Cassiopeia]]).
*A maiden, chained up, facing/turning away from the ecliptic (the constellation [[Andromeda (constellation)|Andromeda]]), next to [[Pegasus (constellation)|Pegasus]].
*A [[whale]] just under the ecliptic (the constellation [[Cetus]]).

Other constellations related to the story are:
*[[Perseus (constellation)|Perseus]]
*The constellation [[Pegasus (constellation)|Pegasus]], who was born from the stump of [[Medusa]]'s neck, after Perseus had decapitated her.
*The constellation [[Pisces (constellation)|Pisces]], which may have been treated as two fish caught by [[Dictys]] the [[fisherman]] who was brother of [[Polydectes]], king of [[Seriphos]], the place where Perseus and his mother [[Danaë]] were stranded.

==Portrayals of the myth==
[[Image:Museo Nazionale Napoli Perseus And Andromeda.jpg|left|thumb|A small Roman fresco from [[Pompeii]].]]
[[Sophocles]] and [[Euripides]] (and in more modern times [[Pierre Corneille|Corneille]]) made the story the subject of [[tragedies]], and its incidents were represented in numerous ancient works of art.  Jean-Baptiste Lully's opera [[Persée]] also dramatizes the myth.

Andromeda has been the subject of numerous ancient and modern works of art, including [[Andromeda Chained to the Rocks (Rembrandt)]], one of [[Titian]]'s ''poesies'' ([[Wallace Collection]]), and compositions by [[Joachim Wtewael]] ([[Louvre]]), [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]] (Rennes), [[Rubens]], [[Ingres]] and [[Gustave Moreau]].  From the Renaissance onwards the chained nude figure of Andromeda was typically the centre of interest, and often she was shown alone, fearfully awaiting the monster.

In 1973, a short animated film called &quot;Perseus&quot; was made in the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.animator.ru/db/?p=show_film&amp;fid=2626&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike in most depictions, Andromeda was shown with appearance more appropriate for an African person.

The 1981 film ''[[Clash of the Titans (1981 film)|Clash of the Titans]]'' retells the story of Perseus, Andromeda, and Cassiopeia, but makes a few changes (notably Cassiopeia boasts that her daughter is more beautiful than [[Thetis]] as opposed to the Nereids as a group). Thetis was a Nereid, but also the future mother of [[Achilles]]. Andromeda and Perseus meet and fall in love after he saves her soul from the enslavement of Thetis' hideous son, Calibos, whereas in the myth, they simply meet as Perseus returns home from having slain [[Medusa]]. In the film, the monster is called a [[Kraken]], although it is depicted as a lizardlike creature rather than a squid; and combining two elements of the myth, Perseus defeats the sea monster by showing it Medusa's face, turning the monster into stone. Andromeda is depicted as being strong-willed and independent, whereas in the stories she is only really mentioned as being the princess whom Perseus saves from the sea monster. Andromeda was portrayed by [[Judi Bowker]] in this film.

Andromeda is also featured in the 2010 film ''[[Clash of the Titans (2010 film)|Clash of the Titans]]'', a remake of the 1981 version. Several changes were made in regard to the myth, most notably that Perseus did not marry Andromeda after he rescued her from the sea monster. Andromeda was portrayed by [[Alexa Davalos]]. The character is set to appear in the sequel, the second of a planned trilogy, though the actress is being recast for unknown reasons.

At the port city of [[Jaffa]], [[Israel]], an outcropping of rocks near the harbour is reputed by local legend to have been the place from which Andromeda was rescued by Perseus.

'''Antlia''' (from [[Ancient Greek]] ''ἀντλία'') is a [[constellation]] in the southern sky. Its name means &quot;[[pump]]&quot; and it specifically represents an air pump. The stars comprising Antlia are faint, and the constellation was not created until the 18th century. Beginning at the north, Antlia is bordered by [[Hydra (constellation)|Hydra]] the sea snake, [[Pyxis]] the compass, [[Vela (constellation)|Vela]] the sails, and [[Centaurus]] the centaur.

==History==
Antlia was created by the French astronomer Abbé [[Nicolas Louis de Lacaille]], who created fourteen constellations for the southern sky to fill some faint regions. It was originally denominated ''Antlia pneumatica'' to commemorate the [[air pump]] invented by the French physicist [[Denis Papin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= Star Tales |title= Antlia |url=http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/antlia.htm |accessdate=2007-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Astronomical Union]] subsequently adopted it as one of the 88 modern constellations. There is no mythology attached to Antlia as Lacaille discontinued the tradition of giving names from mythology to constellations and instead chose names mostly from scientific instruments.

==Notable features==
{{See also|List of stars in Antlia}}
Antlia is devoid of bright stars. The brightest star is [[Alpha Antliae|α Antliae]], a [[apparent magnitude|magnitude]] 4.25&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt; orange [[giant star|giant]]. Antlia contains the following [[deep sky object]]s:
*[[NGC 2997]], a [[spiral galaxy]] of type [[Galaxy morphological classification|Sc]] which is inclined 45° to our line of sight.
*The [[Antlia Dwarf]], a 14.8&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt; [[dwarf spheroidal galaxy]] that belongs to our [[Local Group]] of galaxies. It was discovered only as recently as 1997.&lt;ref&gt;[http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap970423.html APOD: April 23, 1997 - Antlia: A New Galactic Neighbor&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ara''' is a southern [[constellation]] situated between [[Scorpius]] and [[Triangulum Australe]]. Its name is [[Latin]] for &quot;[[altar]]&quot;. Ara was one of the 48 Greek constellations described by the 2nd century astronomer [[Ptolemy]], and it remains one of the 88 modern constellations defined by the [[International Astronomical Union]].

==Notable features==
===Stars===
{{See also|List of stars in Ara}}
Ara's brightest star, [[Beta Arae|β Arae]], has an [[apparent magnitude]] of 2.9. [[Gamma Arae|γ Arae]] is a [[double star]] just south of β. [[Mu Arae|μ Arae]] is believed to have at least four planets orbiting it, one of which may be rocky in nature.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

The constellation's stars have no names in [[Western culture]], but the [[Culture of China|Chinese]] call [[Alpha Arae|α Arae]] &quot;Choo&quot; (&quot;club&quot; or &quot;staff&quot;), and [[Epsilon Arae|ε Arae]] &quot;Tso Kang&quot;, meaning 'left guard'.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

===Deep sky objects===
The northwest corner of Ara is crossed by the [[Milky Way]] and contains several [[open cluster]]s, notably [[NGC 6200]] and [[diffuse nebula]]e. The brightest of the [[globular cluster]]s, sixth magnitude [[NGC 6397]], at a distance of {{convert|8200|ly|km}} from our [[solar system]] might be the closest of all globular clusters in the sky.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

====Open clusters====
*NGC 6193
*[[NGC 6200]]
*NGC 6204
*NGC 6208
*NGC 6250
*NGC 6253
*IC 4651

====Globular clusters====
*NGC 6352
*NGC 6362
*[[NGC 6397]]

The [[Stingray Nebula]] (Hen 3-1357), the youngest known planetary nebula as of 2010, formed in Ara; the light from its formation was first observable around 1987.

==Illustrations==
[[File:Ara Bode.jpg|thumb|left|[[Johann Elert Bode]]'s illustration of Ara, from his ''Uranographia'' (1801)]]
In illustrations, Ara is usually depicted as an [[altar]] with its smoke 'rising' southward.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Ridpath, [http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/ara.htm ''Star Tales''.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mythology==
In ancient [[Greek mythology]], Ara was identified as the altar, made by the [[Cyclops]], where the gods first made offerings and formed an alliance when they were about to fight the [[Titans]].&lt;ref name=&quot;hyginus.astronomica.39&quot;&gt;[[Hyginus]], ''Astronomica'', 39, ''Altar''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Equivalents==
In [[Chinese astronomy]], the stars of the constellation Ara lie within ''[[Azure Dragon|The Azure Dragon of the East]]'' (東方青龍, ''Dōng Fāng Qīng Lóng'').&lt;ref&gt;{{zh icon}} [http://aeea.nmns.edu.tw/2006/0607/ap060701.html AEEA (Activities of Exhibition and Education in Astronomy) 天文教育資訊網 2006 年 7 月 1 日]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Namesakes==
[[USS Ara (AK-136)]] was a [[United States]] navy ship.

'''Arkansas''' ({{IPAc-en|en-us-Arkansas.ogg|ˈ|ɑr|k|ən|s|ɔː}} {{respell|AR|kən-saw}})&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Daniel. (1997) ''English Pronouncing Dictionary'', 15th ed. Cambridge University Press. ISBN 0-521-45272-4&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[U.S. state|state]] located in the [[Southern United States|southern region]] of the [[United States]]. Its name is an [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] name of the [[Quapaw]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Indians]]. Arkansas shares a border with six states (clockwise: N: Missouri; E: Tennessee, Mississippi; S: Louisiana; W: Texas, Oklahoma) with its eastern border largely defined by the [[Mississippi River]]. Its diverse geography ranges from the mountainous regions of the [[The Ozarks|Ozarks]] and the [[Ouachita Mountains]], which make up the [[U.S. Interior Highlands]], to the eastern lowlands along the Mississippi River. The capital and most populous city is [[Little Rock, Arkansas|Little Rock]], located in the central portion of the state.

==Toponym==
The name &quot;Arkansas&quot; derives from the same root as the name for the state of [[Kansas]]. The Kansas tribe of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] are closely associated with the [[Sioux]] tribes of the [[Great Plains]]. The word &quot;Arkansas&quot; itself is a [[French language|French]] pronunciation (&quot;Arcansas&quot;) of a [[Quapaw]] (a related &quot;Kaw&quot; tribe) word &quot;akakaze&quot; meaning &quot;land of downriver people&quot; or the [[Sioux language|Sioux]] word &quot;Akakaze&quot; meaning &quot;people of the south wind&quot;. The pronunciation of Arkansas was made official by an act of the state legislature in 1881, after a dispute between the two U.S. Senators from Arkansas. One wanted to pronounce the name {{IPAc-en|ɑr|ˈ|k|æ|n|z|ə|s}} {{respell|ar|KAN|zəs}} and the other wanted {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɑr|k|ən|s|ɔ|ː}} {{respell|AR|kən-saw}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Arkansas&quot;&gt;The name Arkansas has been pronounced and spelled in a variety of fashions. The region was organized as the [[Territory of Arkansaw]] on July 4, 1819, but the territory was admitted to the [[United States|Union]] as the [[State of Arkansas]] on June 15, 1836. The name was historically {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɑr|k|ən|s|ɔː|,|_|ær|ˈ|k|æ|n|z|ə|s}}, and several other variants. In 1881, the [[Arkansas General Assembly]] passed the following concurrent resolution, now Arkansas Code 1-4-105 ([http://www.arkleg.state.ar.us/assembly/ArkansasCode/0/1-4-105.htm official text]):
&lt;blockquote&gt;Whereas, confusion of practice has arisen in the pronunciation of the name of our state and it is deemed important that the true pronunciation sould be determined for use in oral official proceedings.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;And, whereas, the matter has been thoroughly investigated by the State Historical Society and the Eclectic Society of Little Rock, which have agreed upon the correct pronunciation as derived from history, and the early usage of the American immigrants.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Be it therefore resolved by both houses of the General Assembly, that the only true pronunciation of the name of the state, in the opinion of this body, is that received by the French from the native Indians and committed to writing in the French word representing the sound. It should be pronounced in three (3) syllables, with the final &quot;s&quot; silent, the &quot;a&quot; in each syllable with the Italian sound, and the accent on the first and last syllables. The pronunciation with the accent on the second syllable with the sound of &quot;a&quot; in &quot;man&quot; and the sounding of the terminal &quot;s&quot; is an innovation to be discouraged.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Citizens of the [[State of Kansas]] often pronounce the [[Arkansas River]] as {{IPAc-en|ær|ˈ|k|æ|n|z|ə|s|_|ˈ|r|ɪ|v|ə|r}}, in a manner similar to the common pronunciation of the name of their state.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the state legislature officially declared the possessive form of the state's name to be ''Arkansas's''.&lt;ref&gt;Gambrell, John. [http://www2.arkansasonline.com/news/2007/mar/13/senate-gives-support-possessive-form-arkansas/ &quot;Senate gives support to possessive form of Arkansas.&quot;] ''[[Arkansas Democrat Gazette]]'', March 13, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Mississippi River]] forms most of Arkansas's eastern border, except in [[Clay County, Arkansas|Clay]] and [[Greene County, Arkansas|Greene]] counties where the [[St. Francis River]] forms the western boundary of the [[Missouri Bootheel]], and in dozens of places where the current channel of the Mississippi has meandered from where it had last been legally specified.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=2546 Arkansas State Boundaries] from the [http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/ Encyclopedia of Arkansas]&lt;/ref&gt; Arkansas shares its southern border with [[Louisiana]], its northern border with [[Missouri]], its eastern border with [[Tennessee]] and [[Mississippi]], and its western border with [[Texas]] and [[Oklahoma]].

Arkansas is a land of lakes and rivers, thick forests and fertile soil. The [[Arkansas Delta]] is a flat landscape of [[River delta|rich alluvial soils formed by repeated flooding]] of the adjacent Mississippi. Farther away from the river, in the southeast portion of the state, the Grand Prairie consists of a more undulating landscape. Both are fertile agricultural areas.

The Delta region is bisected by an unusual geological formation known as [[Crowley's Ridge]]. A narrow band of rolling hills, Crowley's Ridge rises from 250 to {{convert|500|ft|m}} above the surrounding alluvial plain and underlies many of the major towns of eastern Arkansas.

Northwest Arkansas is part of the [[Ozark Plateau]] including the [[Ozark Mountains]], to the south are the [[Ouachita Mountains]] and these regions are divided by the [[Arkansas River]]; the southern and eastern parts of Arkansas are called the Lowlands. These mountain ranges are part of the [[U.S. Interior Highlands]] region, the only major mountainous region between the [[Rocky Mountains]] and the [[Appalachian Mountains]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.srs.fs.usda.gov/4106/about/HotSpringsOffice.htm |title=Managing Upland Forests of the Midsouth|publisher=United States Forestry Service |accessdate=2007-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tapestry.usgs.gov/physiogr/physio.html|title=A Tapestry of Time and Terrain: The Union of Two Maps – Geology and Topography|publisher=United States Geological Survey |accessdate=2007-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The highest point in the state is [[Mount Magazine]] in the [[Ozark Mountains]]; it rises to {{convert|2753|ft|m}} above sea level.

More than 43,000 Native American living, hunting and tool making sites, many of them Pre-Columbian burial mounds and rock shelters, have been catalogued by the State Archeologist. Arkansas is currently the only U.S. state in which [[diamond]]s are mined—although by members of the public with primitive digging tools for a small daily fee, not by commercial interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.craterofdiamondsstatepark.com/history/ |title=Crater of Diamonds: History of diamonds, diamond mining in Arkansas |publisher=Craterofdiamondsstatepark.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geology.com/gemstones/united-states-diamond-production.shtml |title=US Diamond Mines – Diamond Mining in the United States |publisher=Geology.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; (near [[Murfreesboro, Arkansas|Murfreesboro]]).

Arkansas is home to a dozen Wilderness Areas totaling around {{convert|150000|acre|km2}}. These areas are set aside for outdoor recreation and are open to hunting, fishing, hiking, and primitive camping. No mechanized vehicles are allowed in these areas, some of which are rarely visited and can provide a good experience of feeling as if you are the only person to have ever stepped foot there.

===Climate===
Arkansas generally has a [[humid subtropical climate]], which borders on [[humid continental climate|humid continental]] in some northern highland areas. While not bordering the [[Gulf of Mexico]], Arkansas is still close enough to this warm, large body of water for it to influence the weather in the state. Generally, Arkansas has hot, humid summers and cold, slightly drier winters. In [[Little Rock, Arkansas|Little Rock]], the daily high temperatures average around {{convert|90|°F|°C|abbr=on}} with lows around {{convert|70|°F|°C|abbr=on}} in the month of July. In January highs average around {{convert|49|°F|°C|abbr=on}} and lows around {{convert|30|°F|°C|abbr=on}}. In [[Siloam Springs, Arkansas|Siloam Springs]] in the northwest part of the state, the average high and low temperatures in July are {{convert|89|°F|°C|abbr=on}} and {{convert|67|°F|°C|abbr=on}} and in January the average high and lows are {{convert|44|°F|°C|abbr=on}} and {{convert|23|°F|°C|abbr=on}}. Annual precipitation throughout the state averages between about {{convert|40|and|60|in|mm|abbr=off}}; somewhat wetter in the south and drier in the northern part of the state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ocs.orst.edu/pub/maps/Precipitation/Total/States/AR/ar.gif Average Annual Precipitation – Arkansas]. Spatial Climate Analysis Service, [[Oregon State University]]. Published 2000. Last Retrieved 2007-10-26.&lt;/ref&gt; Snowfall is common, more so in the north half of the state, which usually gets several snowfalls each winter. This is not only due to its closer proximity to the plains states, but also to the higher elevations found throughout the Ozark and Ouachita mountains. The half of the state south of Little Rock gets less snow, and is more apt to see ice storms, however, sleet and freezing rain are expected throughout the state during the winter months, and can significantly impact travel and day to day life. Arkansas' all time record high is {{convert|120|F|C}} at [[Ozark, Arkansas|Ozark]] on August 10, 1936; the all time record low is {{convert|-29|F|C}} at [[Pond, Arkansas|Pond]] on February 13, 1905.

Arkansas is known for extreme weather. A typical year will see thunderstorms, tornadoes, hail, snow and ice storms. Between both the [[Great Plains]] and the [[Gulf Coast of the United States|Gulf States]], Arkansas receives around 60 days of thunderstorms. A few of the most destructive tornadoes in U.S. history have struck the state. While being sufficiently away from the coast to be safe from a direct hit from a hurricane, Arkansas can often get the remnants of a [[tropical cyclone|tropical system]] which dumps tremendous amounts of rain in a short time and often spawns smaller tornadoes.

In 2008, high [[water]] pouring down the [[White River (Arkansas)|White River]] caused historic flooding in cities along its path in eastern Arkansas.

{{Main|History of Arkansas}}
The first European to reach Arkansas was the [[Spain|Spanish]] explorer [[Hernando de Soto (explorer)|Hernando de Soto]], a veteran of Pizarro's conquest of Peru who died near Lake Village on the Mississippi River in 1542 after almost a year traversing the southern part of the state in search of gold and a passage to China. Arkansas is one of several [[U.S. states]] formed from the territory purchased from [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] in the [[Louisiana Purchase]]. The early Spanish or French explorers of the state gave it its name, which is probably a phonetic spelling of the [[Illinois language|Illinois]] tribe's name for the [[Quapaw]] people, who lived downriver from them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0302b&amp;L=ads-l&amp;P=7800 |title=Linguist list 14.4 |publisher=Listserv.linguistlist.org |date=2003-02-11 |accessdate=2010-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes who lived in Arkansas before moving west were the Cherokee, Quapaw, [[Caddo]], and [[Osage Nation|Osage]] nations. In their forced move westward (under U.S. [[Indian removal]] policies), the [[Five Civilized Tribes]] inhabited Arkansas during its territorial period.

The [[Territory of Arkansas]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Arkansas&quot;/&gt; was organized on July 4, 1819. On June 15, 1836, the State of Arkansas was admitted to the [[United States|Union]] as the 25th [[U.S. state|state]] and the 13th [[slave state]]. Planters settled in the Delta to cultivate cotton; this was the area of the state where most enslaved African Americans were held. Other areas had more subsistence farmers and mixed farming.

Arkansas played a key role in aiding Texas in its war for independence from Mexico; it sent troops and materials to Texas to help fight the war. The proximity of the city of [[Washington, Arkansas|Washington]] to the Texas border involved the town in the [[Texas Revolution]] of 1835–36. Some evidence suggests [[Sam Houston]] and his compatriots planned the revolt in a tavern at Washington in 1834.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arkansasmediaroom.com/news-releases/listings/display.asp?id=165 |title=Old Washington State Park Conserves Town's Heyday |first=Jim |last=Taylor}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the fighting began, a stream of volunteers from Arkansas and the southeastern states flowed through the town toward the Texas battle fields.

When the [[Mexican-American War]] began in 1846, Washington became a rendezvous for volunteer troops. Governor Thomas S. Drew issued a proclamation calling on the state to furnish one regiment of cavalry and one battalion of infantry to join the United States Army. Ten companies of men assembled here, where they were formed into the first Regiment of Arkansas Cavalry.

The state developed a cotton culture in the east in lands of the Mississippi Delta. This was where enslaved labor was used most extensively, as planters brought with them or imported slaves from the Upper South. On the eve of the Civil War in 1860, enslaved African Americans numbered 111,115 people, just over 25% of the state's population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fisher.lib.virginia.edu/collections/stats/histcensus/php/state.php Historical Census Browser, 1860 US Census, University of Virginia]. Retrieved March 21, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Arkansas refused to join the [[Confederate States of America]] until after [[United States President]] [[Abraham Lincoln]] called for troops to respond to the Confederate attack upon [[Battle of Fort Sumter|Fort Sumter]], [[South Carolina]]. The State of Arkansas declared its secession from the [[United States|Union]] on May 6, 1861. While not often cited in historical accounts, the state was the scene of numerous small-scale battles during the [[American Civil War]]. Arkansans of note who contributed to the Civil War included Confederate Major General [[Patrick Cleburne]]. Considered by many to be one of the most brilliant Confederate division commanders of the war, Cleburne was often referred to as &quot;The Stonewall of the West.&quot; Also of note was Major General [[Thomas C. Hindman]]. A former United States Representative, Hindman commanded Confederate forces at the [[Battle of Cane Hill]] and [[Battle of Prairie Grove]].

Under the [[Reconstruction era of the United States#Military reconstruction|Military Reconstruction Act]], Congress restored Arkansas to the Union in June 1868. The Reconstruction legislature established universal male suffrage while disenfranchising former Confederates (mostly Democrats), a public education system, and other general issues to improve the state and help more of the population. The state came under almost exclusive control of [[Radical Republicans]], (those who emigrated from the North being derided as &quot;[[carpetbaggers]]&quot; by ex-Confederates based on allegations of corruption), led by newly elected Governor [[Powell Clayton]], marking a time of great upheaval and racial violence in the state between state militia and the [[Ku Klux Klan]].

In 1874, the [[Brooks-Baxter War]], a political struggle between factions of the [[United States Republican Party|Republican Party]] shook Little Rock and the state governorship. It was settled only when President [[Ulysses S. Grant]] ordered [[Joseph Brooks]] to disperse his militant supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=2276 |title=Brooks-Baxter War – Encyclopedia of Arkansas |accessdate=2007-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the Brooks-Baxter War, a new state constitution was ratified re-enfranchising former Confederates.

In 1881, the Arkansas state legislature enacted a bill that adopted an official pronunciation of the state's name, to combat a controversy then simmering. (See Law and Government below.)

After Reconstruction, the state began to receive more immigrants and migrants. [[Chinese people|Chinese]], [[Italians|Italian]], and [[Syrian]] men were recruited for farm labor in the developing Delta region. None of these nationalities stayed long at farm labor; the Chinese especially quickly became small merchants in towns around the Delta. Some early 20th century immigration included people from eastern Europe. Together, these immigrants made the Delta more diverse than the rest of the state. In the same years, some black migrants moved into the area because of opportunities to develop the bottomlands and own their own property. Many Chinese became such successful merchants in small towns that they were able to educate their children at college.&lt;ref&gt;William D. Baker, ''Minority Settlement in the Mississippi River Counties of the Arkansas Delta, 1870–1930'', Arkansas Preservation Commission [http://www.arkansaspreservation.org/pdf/publications/Minority_Settlement.pdf], accessed 14 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Construction of railroads enabled more farmers to get their products to market. It also brought new development into different parts of the state, including the Ozarks, where some areas were developed as resorts. In a few years at the end of the 19th century, for instance, [[Eureka Springs]] in [[Carroll County, Arkansas|Carroll County]] grew to 10,000 people, rapidly becoming a tourist destination and the fourth largest city of the state. It featured newly constructed, elegant resort hotels and spas planned around its natural springs, considered to have healthful properties. The town's attractions included horse racing and other entertainment. It appealed to a wide variety of classes, becoming almost as popular as [[Hot Springs, Arkansas|Hot Springs]].

In the late 1880s, the worsening agricultural depression catalyzed Populist and third party movements, leading to interracial coalitions. Struggling to stay in power, in the 1890s the Democrats in Arkansas followed other Southern states in passing legislation and constitutional amendments that disfranchised blacks and poor whites. Democrats wanted to prevent their alliance. In 1891 state legislators passed a requirement for a [[literacy test]], knowing that many blacks and whites would be excluded, at a time when more than 25% of the population could neither read nor write. In 1892 they amended the state constitution to include a [[poll tax]] and more complex residency requirements, both of which adversely affected poor people and sharecroppers, and forced them from electoral rolls.

By 1900 the Democratic Party expanded use of the [[white primary]] in county and state elections, further denying blacks a part in the political process. Only in the primary was there any competition among candidates, as Democrats held all the power. The state was a Democratic one-party state for decades, until after the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] and [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]] were passed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oldstatehouse.com/educational_programs/classroom/arkansas_news/detail.asp?id=800&amp;issue_id=36&amp;page=3

Between 1905 and 1911, Arkansas began to receive a small migration of [[Germans|German]], [[Slovaks|Slovak]], and [[Irish people|Irish]] immigrants. The German and Slovak peoples settled in the eastern part of the state known as the [[Prairie]], and the Irish founded small communities in the southeast part of the state. The Germans were mostly Catholic and the Slovaks were Lutheran. The Irish were mostly [[Protestant]] from [[Ulster]].

After the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]]'s decision in [[Brown v. Board of Education|''Brown ''v.'' Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas'']] in 1954, the [[Little Rock Nine]] brought Arkansas to national attention when the Federal government intervened to protect African-American students trying to integrate a high school in the Arkansas capital. Governor [[Orval Faubus]] ordered the [[Arkansas National Guard]] to aid segregationists in preventing nine African-American students from enrolling at Little Rock's Central High School. After attempting three times to contact Faubus, President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] sent 1000 troops from the active-duty 101st Airborne Division to escort and protect the African-American students as they entered school on September 25, 1957. In defiance of federal court orders to integrate, the governor and city of Little Rock decided to close the high schools for the remainder of the school year. By the fall of 1959, the Little Rock high schools were completely integrated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?search=1&amp;entryID=723 |title=Little Rock Nine – Encyclopedia of Arkansas |accessdate=2007-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bill Clinton]], the 42nd [[President of the United States]], was born in [[Hope, Arkansas]]. Before his presidency, Clinton served as the 40th and 42nd [[Governor of Arkansas]], a total of nearly 12 years.

European Americans have a strong presence in the northwestern [[Ozarks]] and the central part of the state. African Americans live mainly in the southern and eastern parts of the state. Arkansans of Irish, English and German ancestry are mostly found in the far northwestern Ozarks near the Missouri border. Ancestors of the Irish in the Ozarks were chiefly [[Ulster Scots people|Scotch-Irish]], Protestants from [[Northern Ireland]], the [[Scotland|Scottish]] lowlands and northern England part of the largest group of immigrants from [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] and [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]] before the American Revolution. [[English American|English]] and [[Scotch-Irish American|Scotch-Irish]] immigrants settled throughout the backcountry of the South and in the more mountainous areas. Americans of [[English American|English]] stock are found throughout the state and make up roughly one tenth of all Arkansans.&lt;ref&gt;David Hackett Fischer, ''Albion's Seed: Four British Folkways in America'', New York: Oxford University Press, 1989, pp.633–639&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to the 2006–2008 American Community Survey, 93.8% of Arkansas' population (over the age of five) spoke only [[English language|English]] at home. About 4.5% of the state's population spoke [[Spanish language|Spanish]] at home. About 0.7% of the state's population spoke any other [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European language]]. About 0.8% of the state's population spoke an [[Languages of Asia|Asian language]], and 0.2% spoke other languages.

&lt;!--Deleted image removed: [[File:Littlerockskyline.jpg|thumb|right|[[Little Rock]] city center.]]--&gt;

The state's gross domestic product for 2005 was $87 billion. Its per capita household median income (in current dollars) for 2004 was $35,295, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.&lt;ref&gt;[http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/05000.html Arkansas QuickFacts] from the US Census Bureau&lt;/ref&gt; The state's agriculture outputs are poultry and eggs, soybeans, sorghum, cattle, cotton, rice, hogs, and milk. Its industrial outputs are food processing, electric equipment, fabricated metal products, machinery, paper products, bromine, and vanadium.

As of January 2010, the state's unemployment rate is 7.6%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bls.gov/lau/ Bls.gov]; Local Area Unemployment Statistics&lt;/ref&gt;

Several global companies are headquartered in the northwest corner of Arkansas, including [[Wal-Mart]] (the world's largest public corporation by revenue in 2007),&lt;ref name=&quot;2007-Fortune-Global-500&quot;&gt;Staff Writer. &quot;[http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/global500/2007/ Fortune Global 500].&quot; ''[[CNN]]/[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]].'' 2007. Retrieved on November 8, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; [[J.B. Hunt]] and [[Tyson Foods]]. This area of the state has experienced an economic boom since the 1970s as a result.

In recent years, [[automobile]] parts manufacturers have opened factories in eastern Arkansas to support auto plants in other states.

Tourism is also very important to the Arkansas economy; the official state nickname &quot;The Natural State&quot; was originally created (as &quot;Arkansas Is A Natural&quot;) for state tourism advertising in the 1970s, and is still regularly used to this day.

According to Forbes.com&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forbes.com/2007/07/10/washington-virginia-utah-biz-cz_kb_0711bizstates-table.html |title=Table: The Best States For Business |publisher=Forbes.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arkansas currently ranks 21st for The Best States for Business, 9th for Business Cost, 40th for Labor, 22nd for Regulatory Environment, 17th for Economic Climate, 9th for Growth Prospects, 34th in Gross Domestic Product, and positive economic change of 3.8% or ranked 22nd.

===Aquaculture===

The state also ranks third in terms of [[channel catfish]] [[aquaculture]], with about 19200 acres under catfish farming in 2010. The peak of catfish farming in the state was in the year 2002, when 38000 acres were under farming.  In 2007, the state’s catfish producers generated sales of $71.5 million – 16 percent of the total U.S. market.&lt;ref&gt;[http://usda.mannlib.cornell.edu/usda/nass/CatfProd//2000s/2002/CatfProd-02-07-2002.pdf] from USDA NASS&lt;/ref&gt; Arkansas was the first state to develop commercial catfish farms in the late 1950s. The number of catfish farms in the state grew through the 1990s as farmers entered the catfish business as a way to provide additional income during a time of low prices for cotton and soybeans. Banks loaned money to support what they saw as a stable source of revenue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arfb.com/news_information/ark_agri/2008v5i2/catfish.aspx] Arkansas Farm Bureau Federation&lt;/ref&gt;

===Taxation===
[[File:Map of Arkansas.png|215px|thumb|right|A map of Arkansas with county boundaries drawn]]
Arkansas imposes a [[state income tax]] with six brackets, ranging from 1.0% to 7.0%. The first $9,000 of military pay of enlisted personnel is exempt from Arkansas tax; officers do not have to pay state income tax on the first $6,000 of their military pay. Retirees pay no tax on [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]], or on the first $6,000 in gain on their pensions along with recovery of [[cost basis]]. Residents of [[Texarkana, Arkansas]] are exempt from Arkansas income tax; wages and business income earned there by residents of [[Texarkana, Texas]] are also exempt. Arkansas's gross receipts ([[sales tax|sales]]) tax and compensating ([[use tax|use]]) tax rate is currently 6%. The state has also mandated that various services be subject to sales tax collection. They include wrecker and towing services; dry cleaning and laundry; body piercing, tattooing and electrolysis; pest control; security and alarm monitoring; self-storage facilities; boat storage and docking; and pet grooming and kennel services.

Along with the state sales tax, there are more than 300 [[Tax|local taxes]] in Arkansas. Cities and counties have the authority to enact additional local sales and use taxes if they are passed by the voters in their area. These local taxes have a ceiling or cap; they cannot exceed $25 for each 1% of tax assessed. These additional taxes are collected by the state, which distributes the money back to the local jurisdictions monthly. Low-income taxpayers with a total annual household income of less than $12,000 are permitted a sales [[tax exemption]] for [[electricity]] usage.

Sales of [[alcoholic beverage]]s account for added taxes. A 10% supplemental mixed drink tax is imposed on the sale of alcoholic beverages (excluding [[beer]]) at [[restaurant]]s. A 4% tax is due on the sale of all [[mixed drink]]s (except beer and [[wine]]) sold for &quot;on-premises&quot; consumption. A 3% tax is due on beer sold for off-premises consumption.

[[Property tax]]es are assessed on real and personal property; only 20% of the value is used as the tax base.

|}

The Democratic Party holds [[majority]] status in the [[Arkansas General Assembly]]. A majority of local and statewide offices are also held by Democrats. This is rare in the modern [[Southern United States|South]], where a majority of statewide offices are held by Republicans. Arkansas had the distinction in 1992 of being the only state in the country to give the majority of its vote to a single candidate in the presidential election—native son [[Bill Clinton]]—while every other state's electoral votes were won by pluralities of the vote among the three candidates. Arkansas has become more reliably Republican in presidential elections in recent years. The state voted for [[John McCain]] in 2008 by a margin of 20 percentage points, making it one of the few states in the country to vote more Republican than it had in 2004. (The others were Louisiana, Tennessee, Oklahoma and West Virginia.)&lt;ref&gt;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/54/Election-state-04-08.png&lt;/ref&gt; Obama's relatively poor showing in Arkansas was likely due to a lack of enthusiasm from state Democrats following former Arkansas First Lady [[Hillary Clinton]]'s failure to win the nomination, and his relatively poor performance among rural white voters. However, the Democratic presence remains strong on the state level; in 2006, Democrats were elected to all statewide offices by the voters in a Democratic sweep that included the [[Democratic Party of Arkansas]] regaining the governorship, and in 2008, freshman Senator Mark Pryor was re-elected with nearly 80% of the vote against Green candidate [[Rebekah Kennedy]] with no Republican opposition.

Most Republican strength lies mainly in the northwestern part of the state, particularly [[Fort Smith, Arkansas|Fort Smith]] and [[Bentonville, Arkansas|Bentonville]], as well as North Central Arkansas around the [[Mountain Home, Arkansas|Mountain Home]] area. In the latter area, Republicans have been known to get 90 percent or more of the vote. The rest of the state is more Democratic. Arkansas has only elected two Republicans to the U.S. Senate since [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]], [[Tim Hutchinson]], who was defeated after one term by [[Mark Pryor]] and [[John Boozman]], who defeated incumbent [[Blanche Lincoln]]. The General Assembly has not been controlled by the Republican Party since Reconstruction and is the fourth most heavily Democratic Legislature in the country, after [[Massachusetts General Court|Massachusetts]], [[Hawaii State Legislature|Hawaii]], and [[Connecticut General Assembly|Connecticut]]. Arkansas was one of just three states among the states of the former [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] that sent two Democrats to the U.S. Senate (the others being [[Florida]] and [[Virginia]]) during the first decade of the 21st century.

Although Democrats have an overwhelming majority of registered voters, Arkansas Democrats tend to be slightly more conservative than their national counterparts, particularly outside Little Rock. Arkansas' Democratic congressman is a member of the [[Blue Dog Coalition]], which tends to be more pro-business, pro-military, and socially conservative than the center-left Democratic mainstream. Reflecting the state's large evangelical population, the state has a strong social conservative bent. Under the [[Arkansas Constitution]] Arkansas is a [[right to work state]], its voters passed a ban on [[same-sex marriage]] with 75% voting yes, and the state is one of a handful with legislation on its books banning [[abortion]] in the event ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' is ever overturned.

In Arkansas, the lieutenant governor is elected separately from the governor and thus can be from a different political party.

Each officer's term is four years long. Office holders are [[term-limited]] to two full terms plus any partial terms before the first full term. Arkansas governors served two-year terms until a referendum lengthened the term to four years, effective with the 1986 general election. Statewide elections are held two years after presidential elections.

Some of Arkansas's [[county (United States)|counties]] have two [[county seat]]s, as opposed to the usual one seat. The arrangement dates back to when travel was extremely difficult in the state. The seats are usually on opposite sides of the county. Though travel is no longer the difficulty it once was, there are few efforts to eliminate the two seat arrangement where it exists, since the county seat is a source of pride (and jobs) to the city involved.

Arkansas is the only state to specify the pronunciation of its name by law (AR-kan-saw).&lt;ref name=&quot;Arkansas&quot;/&gt;

Article 19 (Miscellaneous Provisions), Item 1 in the [[Arkansas Constitution]] is entitled &quot;Atheists disqualified from holding office or testifying as witness,&quot; and states that &quot;No person who denies the being of a God shall hold any office in the civil departments of this State, nor be competent to testify as a witness in any Court.&quot; However, in 1961, the [[United States Supreme Court]] in ''[[Torcaso v. Watkins]]'' (1961), held that a similar requirement in [[Maryland]] was unenforceable because violated the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First]] and [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth]] Amendments to the US Constitution. The latter amendment, per current precedent, makes the [[United States Bill of Rights|federal Bill of Rights]] binding on the states. As a result, this provision has not been known to have been enforced in modern times, and it is understood that it would be struck down if challenged in court.

'''Apus''' is a faint [[constellation]] in the southern sky, first defined in the late 16th century. Its name means &quot;no feet&quot; in [[Greek language|Greek]], and it represents a [[bird-of-paradise]] (which were once believed to lack feet). It is bordered by [[Triangulum Australe]], [[Circinus]], [[Musca]], [[Chamaeleon]], [[Octans]], [[Pavo (constellation)|Pavo]] and [[Ara (constellation)|Ara]]. Its [[genitive]] is &quot;Apodis&quot;.

==History==
Apus was one of twelve constellations created by [[Petrus Plancius]] from the observations of [[Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser]] and [[Frederick de Houtman]] and it first appeared on a 35&amp;nbsp;cm diameter celestial globe published in 1597 (or 1598) in Amsterdam by Plancius with [[Jodocus Hondius]]. Plancius called the constellation '''Paradysvogel Apis Indica'''; the first word is [[Dutch language|Dutch]] for 'bird of paradise', but the others are [[Latin]] for &quot;Indian Bee&quot;; &quot;apis&quot; (Latin for &quot;bee&quot;) is presumably an error for &quot;avis&quot; or &quot;bird&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/apus.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; This confusion seems to have prompted a rename of two constellations: &quot;Avis Indica&quot; to &quot;Apus&quot; and the constellation of the bee, Apis, to [[Musca]] the fly.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

After its introduction on Plancius's globe, the first known depiction of the constellation in a celestial atlas was in [[Johann Bayer]]'s ''[[Uranometria]]'' of 1603.

== Notable features ==
{{See also|List of stars in Apus}}

'''Abadan''' ({{Audio|En-Abadan Pronunciation.ogg|listen}} {{lang-fa|آبادان}}) is a city in the [[Khuzestan]] province in southwestern [[Iran]]. It lies on [[Abadan Island]] ({{convert|68|km|mi|abbr=on|disp=s}} long, 3–19&amp;nbsp;km or 2–12&amp;nbsp;miles wide, the island is bounded in the west by the [[Arvand]]/[[Shatt al-Arab]] waterway and to the east by the [[Bahmanshir]] outlet of the [[Karun River]]), {{convert|53|km|mi|}} from the [[Persian Gulf]],&lt;ref name=&quot;eb&quot;/&gt; near the Iraqi-Iran border. It is the capital of [[Abadan County]]. The civilian population of the city dropped to near zero during the eight-years [[Iran–Iraq War]]. In 1992, only 84,774 had returned to live in the city. By 2001, the population had jumped to 206,073, and it was 217,988 according to 2006 census. [[Abadan Refinery]] is one of the largest in the world.

==Etymology==
The earliest mention of the island of Abadan, if not the port itself is found in works of the geographer Marcian, who renders the name &quot;Apphadana&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Geographia Marciani Heracleotae'', ed. David Hoeschel, Augsburg 1600 p48&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier, the classical geographer, [[Ptolemy]] notes &quot;Apphana&quot; as an island off the mouth of the Tigris (which is, where the modern Island of Abadan is located). An etymology for this name is presented by 'B. Farahvashi'' to be derived from the [[Persian language|Persian]] word &quot;ab&quot; (water) and the root &quot;pā&quot; (guard, watch) thus &quot;coastguard station&quot;).

In the Islamic times, a pseudo-etymology was produced by the historian [[Ahmad ibn Yahya al-Baladhuri]] (d.892) quoting a folk story that the town was presumably founded by one &quot;''Abbad&lt;ref name=&quot;eb&quot;&gt;[http://search.eb.com/eb/article-9003216 &quot;Abadan.&quot;] ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''. 18 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt; bin Hosayn from the Arabian Tribe of [[Banu Tamim]]'', who established a garrison there during the governorship of ''Hajjaj'' in the [[Ummayad]] period.

In the subsequent centuries, the Persian version of the name had begun to come into general use before it was adopted by official decree in 1935.&lt;ref name=&quot;ei&quot;&gt;[http://www.iranica.com/articles/search/searchpdf.isc?ReqStrPDFPath=/home1/iranica/articles/v1_articles/abadan&amp;OptStrLogFile=/home/iranica/public_html/logs/pdfdownload.html Abadan], in [[Encyclopaedia Iranica]], pp.51-52&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Abadan is thought to have been further developed into a major port city under the [[Abbasid]]s' rule. In this time period, it was a commercial source of [[salt]] and woven [[mat]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;eb&quot;/&gt; The [[siltation]] of the river delta forced the town further away from water; In the 14th century, however, [[Ibn Battutah]] described Abadan just as a small port in a flat salty plain.&lt;ref name=&quot;eb&quot;/&gt; Politically, Abadan was often the subject of dispute between the nearby states; in 1847, Persia acquired it, in which state Abadan has remained since. From the 17th century onward, the island of Abadan was part of the lands of the [[Arab]] ''Ka'ab'' ([[Bani Kaab]]) tribe. One section of this tribe, ''Mohaysen'', had its headquarters at ''Mohammara''(present-day [[Khorramshahr]]), until the removal of Shaikh [[Khaz'al Khan]] in 1924.&lt;ref name=&quot;ei&quot; /&gt;
[[File:Iran eraq war.jpg|thumb|200px|Exploded tank, remains as symbol of Iran–Iraq War (1980-1988).]]

[[File:Abadan ruin.jpg|thumb|200px|Ruins of a building in Abadan. Abadan had suffered serious damages during Iran–Iraq War (1980-88), including Saddam's deadly chemical weapons.]]
It was not until the 20th century that rich oil fields were discovered in the area. In 1910, the population had been around 400. The [[Anglo-Persian Oil Company]] built their first pipeline terminus [[oil refinery]] in Abadan, starting in 1909 and completing it in 1913 (see [[Abadan Refinery]]). By 1938, it was the largest in the world. To this day it remains a vast facility for refining [[petroleum]]. The facilities necessitated an equally vast population: more than 220,000 people in 1956.&lt;ref name=&quot;eb&quot;/&gt;

Only 9% of managers (of the oil company) were from Khuzestan. The proportion of natives of [[Tehran]], the [[Caspians|Caspian]], [[Azarbaijan]] and [[Kurdistan Province, Iran|Kurdistan]] rose from 4% of [[blue collar]] workers to 22% of [[White-collar worker|white collar]] workers to 45% of managers. Thus while [[Arabic]] speakers were concentrated on the lower rungs of the work force, managers tended to be brought in from some distance.&lt;ref name=&quot;ei&quot; /&gt;

During [[World War II]], Abadan was a major logistics center for [[Lend-Lease]] aircraft being sent to the [[Soviet Union]] by the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://airforcehistoryindex.org/data/000/190/278.xml USAFHRA document 00190278]&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 19, 1978—the anniversary of the US backed pro-Shah coup d'état which overthrew the nationalists and popular Iranian prime minister, Dr. [[Mohammed Mossadegh]]—the Cinema Rex, a movie theatre in Abadan, Iran, was set ablaze by four Islamic Revolution sympathizers in an attempt to help the cause of Iran's Islamic Revolution. The local Abadan police had taken notice, and became suspicious of Hossein Takbali-zadeh and his accomplices, and had started following the arsonists as they were entering Cinema Rex. The police decided to continue their surveillance and track the group after they left the movie theater. This incident ended up led to the [[Cinema Rex Fire]], where over 350 people perished. At the trial, Hossein Takbali-zadeh stated that his three accomplices by the three names Faraj, Falah, and Yadollah had all burned in the fire. The reformist Sobhe Emrooz newspaper in one of its editorials revealed that the Cinema Rex was burned down by the radical Islamists. The newspaper was shut down immediately after.

In September 1980, Abadan was almost overrun during a surprise attack on Khuzestan by Iraq, marking the beginning of the [[Iran–Iraq War]]. For 18 months Abadan was besieged, but never captured, by Iraqi forces. Much of the city, including the oil refinery which was the world's largest refinery with capacity of 680,000 barrels per day, was badly damaged or destroyed by the siege and by bombing. Previous to the war, the city's civilian [[population]] was about 300,000, but before it was over, most of the populace had sought refuge elsewhere in Iran.

After the war, the biggest concern was the rebuilding of Abadan's oil refinery. In 1993, the refinery began limited operation &amp; and the port reopened. By 1997, the refinery reached the same rate of production it was at before the war. Recently, Abandan has been the site of major labor activity as workers at the oil refineries in the city have staged walkouts and strikes to protest non-payment of wages and the political situation in the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cpgb.org.uk/worker/794/workersorganise.php Workers organise against regime Weekly Worker 794]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recent events===
To honor the 100th anniversary of the refining of oil in Abadan, city officials are planning an &quot;oil [[museum]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;chn.ir&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Southern Iran Craves for an Oil Museum | url=http://www.chn.ir/en/news/?id=5870&amp;section=2 | accessdate= 20 October 2005 }} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Abadan oil refinery was featured on the reverse side of Iran's 100-rial banknotes printed in 1965 and from 1971 to 1973.

==Places of interest==
The [[Abadan Institute of Technology]] was established in Abadan in 1939. The school specialized in [[engineering]] and petroleum [[chemistry]], and was designed to train staff for the refinery in town. The school's name has since changed several times, but since 1989 has been considered a branch campus of the [[Petroleum University of Technology]], centered in [[Tehran]].

There is an international [[Abadan Airport|airport]] in Abadan. It is represented by the [[IATA airport code]] ABD.

==Climate==
The climate in Abadan is [[arid climate|arid]] and similar to [[Baghdad|Baghdad's]], but slightly hotter due to Abadan's lower latitude. Summers are dry and hot, with temperatures above 45 degrees almost daily with a mean of around 55 degrees, soaring temperatures may advance to over 65 degrees. Winters are mildly wet and spring-like, though subject to cold spells. Winter temperatures are around 16-20 degrees. The [[List of weather records#Heat|world's highest unconfirmed temperature]] was a temperature flare up during a [[heat burst]] in June 1967, with a temperature of {{convert|87|°C|°F}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Burt | first = Christopher C | title = Extreme Weather | origyear = 2004 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=NuP7ATq9nWgC&amp;pg=PA36&amp;lpg=PA36&amp;dq=heat+burst+158&amp;source=web&amp;ots=4J6H-elJde&amp;sig=7jyyBPPPguifgRFtkMMDDhYEo1Q#PPA36,M1 | accessdate = 2007-06-21 | publisher = W.

'''Sir Alexander Fleming''' (6 August 1881 – 11 March 1955) was a Scottish [[biologist]] and [[pharmacologist]]. He wrote many articles on bacteriology, immunology, and chemotherapy. His best-known discoveries are the discovery of the [[enzyme]] [[lysozyme]] in 1923 and the [[antibiotic]] substance [[penicillin]] from the mold ''[[Penicillium notatum]]'' in 1928, for which he shared the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 1945 with [[Howard Florey]] and [[Ernst Chain]].&lt;ref name=lesprixnobel&gt;{{cite web | author= Karl Grandin, ed. | title=Alexander Fleming Biography | url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1945/fleming.html | work=Les Prix Nobel | publisher=The Nobel Foundation | year=1945 | accessdate=2011-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time Magazine]]'' named Fleming one of the [[Time 100: The Most Important People of the Century|100 Most Important People of the 20th Century]] for his discovery&lt;ref name=&quot;attributed discovery&quot;&gt;Although Fleming is popularly given the credit for this discovery what he actually did in 1928 was rediscover, and give the name “[[penicillin]]” to, a derivative from [[Penicillium]] fungi. He neither discovered [[Penicillium]] nor was he the first to observe, nor even commence research into, its ability to inhibit or kill certain bacteria; see [[penicillin#History|the history of penicillin]] as well as [[History of penicillin|a table of earlier researches and known uses of penicillin and related substances]].&lt;/ref&gt; of [[penicillin]], and stated:

{{quote|It was a discovery that would change the course of history. The active ingredient in that mould, which Fleming named penicillin, turned out to be an infection-fighting agent of enormous potency. When it was finally recognised for what it was, the most efficacious life-saving drug in the world, penicillin would alter forever the treatment of bacterial infections. By the middle of the century, Fleming's discovery had spawned a huge [[pharmaceutical industry]], churning out synthetic penicillins that would conquer some of mankind's most ancient scourges, including [[syphilis]], [[gangrene]] and [[tuberculosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

By the middle of the century, Fleming's discovery had spawned a huge [[pharmaceutical industry]], churning out synthetic penicillins that would conquer some of mankind's most ancient scourges, including syphilis, gangrene and tuberculosis.}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Biography==
=== Early life ===
Fleming was born on 6 August 1881 at [[Lochfield]], a farm near [[Darvel]] in [[Ayrshire]], Scotland. He was the third of the four children of Hugh Fleming (1816–1888) from his second marriage to Grace Stirling Morton (1848–1928), the daughter of a neighbouring farmer. Hugh Fleming had four surviving children from his first marriage. He was 59 at the time of his second marriage, and died when Alexander (known as Alec) was seven.

Fleming went to Loudoun Moor School and Darvel School, and earned a two-year scholarship to [[Kilmarnock Academy]] before moving to London where he attended the [[University of Westminster|Royal Polytechnic Institution]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Notable Names Database&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Alexander Fleming Biography | url=http://www.nndb.com/people/696/000091423/ | accessdate=2010-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; After working in a shipping office for four years, the twenty-year-old Fleming inherited some money from an uncle, John Fleming. His elder brother, Tom, was already a physician and suggested to his younger sibling that he follow the same career, and so in 1903, the younger Alexander enrolled at [[St Mary's Hospital (London)|St Mary's Hospital]], [[Paddington]], London. He qualified for the school with distinction in 1906 and had the option of becoming a surgeon.

By chance, however, he had been a member of the rifle club (he had been an active member of the [[Volunteer Force (Great Britain)|Volunteer Force]] since 1900). The captain of the club, wishing to retain Fleming in the team suggested that he join the research department at St Mary's, where he became assistant bacteriologist to Sir [[Almroth Wright]], a pioneer in [[vaccine]] therapy and immunology. He gained an M.B. and then a B.Sc. with Gold Medal in 1908, and became a lecturer at St. Mary's until 1914. On 23 December 1915, Fleming married a trained nurse, Sarah Marion McElroy of [[Killala]], [[County Mayo]], Ireland.

Fleming served throughout [[World War I]] as a captain in the [[Royal Army Medical Corps]], and was [[Mentioned in Dispatches]]. He and many of his colleagues worked in battlefield hospitals at the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] in France. In 1918 he returned to St. Mary's Hospital, which was a [[teaching hospital]]. He was elected Professor of Bacteriology in 1928.

=== Research ===
====Work before penicillin====
After the war, Fleming actively searched for anti-bacterial agents, having witnessed the death of many soldiers from [[sepsis]] resulting from infected [[wounds]]. [[Antiseptics]] killed the patients' immunological defences more effectively than they killed the invading bacteria. In an article he submitted for the medical journal ''[[The Lancet]]'' during [[World War I]], Fleming described an ingenious experiment, which he was able to conduct as a result of his own glass blowing skills, in which he explained why antiseptics were killing more soldiers than infection itself during [[World War I]]. Antiseptics worked well on the surface, but deep wounds tended to shelter anaerobic bacteria from the antiseptic agent, and antiseptics seemed to remove beneficial agents produced that protected the patients in these cases at least as well as they removed bacteria, and did nothing to remove the bacteria that were out of reach. Sir [[Almroth Wright]] strongly supported Fleming's findings, but despite this, most army physicians over the course of the war continued to use antiseptics even in cases where this worsened the condition of the patients.

====Accidental discovery====
[[Image:PenicillinPSAedit.jpg|thumb|Miracle cure.]]
{{Main|Discovery of penicillin}}
&quot;When I woke up just after dawn on September 28, 1928, I certainly didn't plan to revolutionise all medicine by discovering the world's first antibiotic, or bacteria killer,&quot; Fleming would later say, &quot;But I suppose that was exactly what I did.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn1-56308-159-8&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Haven, Kendall F. |title=Marvels of Science : 50 Fascinating 5-Minute Reads |publisher=Libraries Unlimited |location=Littleton, Colo |year=1994 |page= 182|isbn=1-56308-159-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;attributed discovery&quot;/&gt;

By 1928, Fleming was investigating the properties of [[staphylococcus|staphylococci]]. He was already well-known from his earlier work, and had developed a reputation as a brilliant researcher, but his laboratory was often untidy. On 3 September 1928, Fleming returned to his laboratory having spent August on holiday with his family. Before leaving, he had stacked all his cultures of staphylococci on a bench in a corner of his laboratory. On returning, Fleming noticed that one culture was contaminated with a fungus, and that the colonies of staphylococci that had immediately surrounded it had been destroyed, whereas other colonies farther away were normal. Fleming showed the contaminated culture to his former assistant Merlin Price, who reminded him, ''&quot;That's how you discovered [[lysozyme]].&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;Hare, R. ''The Birth of Penicillin,'' Allen &amp; Unwin, London, 1970&lt;/ref&gt; Fleming grew the mould in a pure culture and found that it produced a substance that killed a number of disease-causing bacteria. He identified the mould as being from the ''[[Penicillium]]'' genus, and, after some months of calling it ''&quot;mould juice&quot;'' named the substance it released ''[[penicillin]]'' on 7 March 1929.&lt;ref&gt;Diggins, F. ''The true history of the discovery of penicillin by Alexander Fleming'' Biomedical Scientist, March 2003, Insititute of Biomedical Sciences, London. (Originally published in the Imperial College School of Medicine Gazette)&lt;/ref&gt; 

He investigated its positive anti-bacterial effect on many organisms, and noticed that it affected bacteria such as staphylococci and many other [[Gram-positive]] pathogens that cause [[scarlet fever]], [[pneumonia]], [[meningitis]] and [[diphtheria]], but not [[typhoid fever]] or [[paratyphoid fever]], which are caused by [[Gram-negative]] bacteria, for which he was seeking a cure at the time. It also affected ''[[Neisseria gonorrhoeae]],'' which causes [[gonorrhoea]] although this bacterium is Gram-negative.

Fleming published his discovery in 1929, in the British ''Journal of Experimental Pathology,''&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid6994200&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Fleming A |title=Classics in infectious diseases: on the antibacterial action of cultures of a penicillium, with special reference to their use in the isolation of B. influenzae by Alexander Fleming, Reprinted from the British ''Journal of Experimental Pathology'' 10:226-236, 1929 |journal=Rev. Infect. Dis. |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=129–39 |year=1980 |pmid=6994200 |doi= |url= |issn= |accessdate=2009-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; but little attention was paid to his article. Fleming continued his investigations, but found that cultivating penicillium was quite difficult, and that after having grown the mould, it was even more difficult to isolate the antibiotic agent. Fleming's impression was that because of the problem of producing it in quantity, and because its action appeared to be rather slow, penicillin would not be important in treating infection. Fleming also became convinced that penicillin would not last long enough in the human body (''in vivo'') to kill bacteria effectively. Many clinical tests were inconclusive, probably because it had been used as a surface antiseptic. In the 1930s, Fleming’s trials occasionally showed more promise,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/331/7516/579-c/DC1 Keith Bernard Ros], who worked with Fleming, was treated with penicillin during their research.&lt;/ref&gt; and he continued, until 1940, to try to interest a chemist skilled enough to further refine usable penicillin.

Fleming finally abandoned penicillin, and not long after he did, Florey and Chain at the Radcliffe Infirmary in Oxford took up researching and mass-producing it, with funds from the U.S. and British governments. They started mass production after the bombing of [[Pearl Harbor]]. When [[D-day|D-Day]] arrived, they had made enough penicillin to treat all the wounded Allied forces.

====Purification and stabilisation ====
[[Image:Penicillin-G 3D.png|thumb|left|3D-model of benzylpenicillin.]]

[[Ernst Boris Chain|Ernst Chain]] and [[Edward Abraham|Edward P Abraham]] worked out how to isolate and concentrate penicillin. Abraham was the first to propose the correct structure of penicillin.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;in October [1943] Abraham proposed a molecular structure which included a cyclic formation containing three carbon atoms and one nitrogen atom, the β-lactam ring, not then known in natural products. This structure was not immediately published due to the restrictions of wartime secrecy, and was initially strongly disputed, by Sir Robert Robinson among others, but it was finally confirmed in 1945 by Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin using X-ray analysis.&quot; Oxford Dictionary of National Biography; &quot;Abraham, Sir Edward Penley&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/obituary-sir-edward-abraham-1093226.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first=Gordon | last=Lowe | title=Obituary: Sir Edward Abraham | date=13 May 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after the team published its first results in 1940, Fleming telephoned [[Howard Florey, Baron Florey|Howard Florey]], Chain's head of department, to say that he would be visiting within the next few days. When Chain heard that he was coming, he remarked, ''&quot;Good God! I thought he was dead.&quot;''

[[Norman Heatley]] suggested transferring the active ingredient of penicillin back into water by changing its acidity. This produced enough of the drug to begin testing on animals. There were many more people involved in the Oxford team, and at one point the entire Dunn School was involved in its production.

After the team had developed a method of purifying penicillin to an effective first stable form in 1940, several clinical trials ensued, and their amazing success inspired the team to develop methods for mass production and mass distribution in 1945.

Fleming was modest about his part in the development of penicillin, describing his fame as the ''&quot;Fleming Myth&quot;'' and he praised Florey and Chain for transforming the laboratory curiosity into a practical drug. Fleming was the first to discover the properties of the active substance, giving him the privilege of naming it: penicillin. He also kept, grew and distributed the original mould for twelve years, and continued until 1940 to try to get help from any chemist who had enough skill to make penicillin. But Sir Henry Harris said in 1998: ''&quot;Without Fleming, no Chain; without Chain, no Florey; without Florey, no Heatley; without Heatley, no penicillin.&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;Henry Harris, ''Howard Florey and the development of penicillin'', a lecture given on Sept. 29, 1998, at the Florey Centenary, 1898–1998, Sir William Dunn School of Pathology, Oxford University (sound recording) [http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/1610017]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Antibiotics====
[[Image:Staphylococcus aureus (AB Test).jpg|right|thumb|Modern antibiotics are tested using a method similar to Fleming's discovery]]
Fleming's accidental discovery and isolation of penicillin in September 1928 marks the start of modern [[antibiotics]]. Fleming also discovered very early that [[bacteria]] developed [[antibiotic resistance]] whenever too little penicillin was used or when it was used for too short a period. [[Almroth Wright]] had predicted antibiotic resistance even before it was noticed during experiments. Fleming cautioned about the use of penicillin in his many speeches around the world. He cautioned not to use penicillin unless there was a properly diagnosed reason for it to be used, and that if it were used, never to use too little, or for too short a period, since these are the circumstances under which bacterial resistance to antibiotics develops.

=== Personal life===
The popular story&lt;ref&gt;eg, ''Philadelphia Enquirer'', 17 July 1945: Brown, ''Penicillin Man'', note 43 to Chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Lord Randolph Churchill|Winston Churchill's father]] paying for Fleming's education after Fleming's father saved young [[Winston Churchill|Winston]] from death is false. According to the biography, ''Penicillin Man: Alexander Fleming and the Antibiotic Revolution'' by [[Kevin Brown (historian of medicine)|Kevin Brown]], Alexander Fleming, in a letter&lt;ref&gt;14 November 1945; British Library Additional Manuscripts 56115:  Brown, ''Penicillin Man'', note 44 to Chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt; to his friend and colleague Andre Gratia,&lt;ref&gt;see Wikipedia [[Discovery of penicillin]] article entry for 1920&lt;/ref&gt; described this as ''&quot;A wondrous fable.&quot;'' Nor did he save Winston Churchill himself during [[World War II]]. Churchill was saved by [[Charles Wilson, 1st Baron Moran|Lord Moran]], using [[Sulfonamide (medicine)|sulphonamide]]s, since he had no experience with penicillin, when Churchill fell ill in [[Carthage]] in [[Tunisia]] in 1943. The ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' and the ''[[Morning Post]]'' on 21 December 1943 wrote that he had been saved by penicillin. He was saved by the new sulphonamide drug, [[sulfapyridine|Sulphapyridine]], known at the time under the research code M&amp;B 693, discovered and produced by [[May &amp; Baker|May &amp; Baker Ltd]], [[Dagenham]], [[Essex]] – a subsidiary of the French group [[Rhône-Poulenc]]. In a subsequent [[radio broadcast]], Churchill referred to the new drug as ''&quot;This admirable M&amp;B.&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;A History of May &amp; Baker 1834–1984, Alden Press 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; It is highly probable that the correct information about the [[sulphonamide]] did not reach the newspapers because, since the original sulphonamide antibacterial, [[Prontosil]], had been a discovery by the German laboratory Bayer and Britain was at war with [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] at the time, it was thought better to raise British morale by associating Churchill's cure with the British discovery, penicillin.

Fleming's first wife, Sarah, died in 1949. Their only child, Robert Fleming, became a [[General practitioner|general medical practitioner]]. After Sarah's death, Fleming married Dr. [[Amalia Fleming|Amalia Koutsouri-Vourekas]], a [[Greek people|Greek]] colleague at St. Mary's, on 9 April 1953; she died in 1986.

===Death===
In 1955, Fleming died at his home in London of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]]. He was cremated and his ashes interred in [[St Paul's Cathedral]] a week later.

The laboratory at [[St Mary's Hospital, London]] where Fleming discovered penicillin is home to the [[Fleming Museum]], a popular attraction to thousands of London visitors annually. There is also a school in the city [[Lomita]] in [[Los Angeles County]], [[California]] named Alexander Fleming Middle School.
The [[University of Westminster]] has named one of its student buildings located near Old Street in honour of Fleming and [[Imperial College]] also has a building named after him, the Sir Alexander Fleming Building. It is based in the [[South Kensington]] campus and is the site of much of the preclinical undergraduate medical teaching. The cafe named in his honour is very popular with medics and non-medics alike. It is commonly pronounced SAF CAF, and was opened by Her Majesty the Queen in 1998. 

* Fleming, Florey and Chain jointly received the [[Nobel Prize in Medicine]] in 1945. According to the rules of the Nobel committee a maximum of three people may share the prize. Fleming's Nobel Prize medal was acquired by the [[National Museums of Scotland]] in 1989, and will be on display when the Royal Museum re-opens in 2011.
* Fleming was awarded the Hunterian Professorship by the [[Royal College of Surgeons]] of England 
* Fleming and Florey were knighted, as Knights Bachelor, in 1944; twenty-one years later, in 1965, Florey was elevated to the life-peerage as Baron Florey of Adelaide in the State of South Australia and Commonwealth of Australia and of Marston in the County of Oxford.
* When 2000 was approaching, at least three large Swedish magazines ranked penicillin as the most important discovery of the millennium. Some of these magazines estimated that about 200 million lives have been saved by this discovery.{{citation needed|date=September 2010}}
* A statue of Alexander Fleming stands outside the main bullring in [[Madrid]], Plaza de Toros de [[Las Ventas]]. It was erected by subscription from grateful [[matador]]s, as penicillin greatly reduced the number of deaths in the bullring. 
* Flemingovo náměstí is a square named after Fleming in the university area of the [[Dejvice]] community in [[Prague]].
* In mid-2009, Fleming was commemorated on a new series of [[banknotes of the pound sterling|banknotes]] issued by the [[Clydesdale Bank]]; his image appears on the new issue of £5 notes.&lt;ref name=&quot;banknotes&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/7828554.stm|title= Banknote designs mark Homecoming|date=2008-01-14|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2009-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carnegie was born in [[Dunfermline]], Scotland, and migrated to the United States as a child with his parents. His first job in the United States was as a factory worker in a [[bobbin]] factory. Later on he became a bill logger for the owner of the company. Soon after he became a messenger boy. Eventually he progressed up the ranks of a telegraph company. He built Pittsburgh's [[Carnegie Steel Company]], which was later merged with [[Elbert H. Gary|Elbert H. Gary's]] Federal Steel Company and several smaller companies to create [[U.S. Steel]]. With the fortune he made from business among others he built [[Carnegie Hall]], later he turned to philanthropy and interests in education, founding the [[Carnegie Corporation of New York]], [[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace]], [[Carnegie Institution of Washington]], [[Carnegie Mellon University]] and the [[Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh]].

Carnegie donated most of his money to establish many [[Carnegie library|libraries]], schools, and universities in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada and other countries, as well as a pension fund for former employees. He is often regarded as the [[List of wealthiest historical figures|second-richest man in history]] after [[John D. Rockefeller]]. Carnegie started as a [[telegraph]]er and by the 1860s had investments in railroads, railroad sleeping cars, bridges and oil derricks. He built further wealth as a bond salesman raising money for American enterprise in Europe.

He earned most of his fortune in the [[steel|steel industry]]. In the 1870s, he founded the [[Carnegie Steel Company]], a step which cemented his name as one of the &quot;Captains of Industry&quot;. By the 1890s, the company was the largest and most profitable industrial enterprise in the world. Carnegie sold it in 1901 for $480 million to [[J.P. Morgan]], who created [[U.S. Steel]]. Carnegie devoted the remainder of his life to large-scale philanthropy, with special emphasis on local libraries, world peace, education and scientific research. His life has often been referred to as a true &quot;[[rags to riches]]&quot; story.

==Biography==
===Early life===
[[Image:Birthplace of Andrew Carnegie, Dunfermline.jpg|thumb|right|170px|Birthplace of Andrew Carnegie in [[Dunfermline]], Scotland]]

'''Andrew Carnegie''' was born in [[Dunfermline, Scotland]], in a typical weaver's cottage with only one main room consisting of half the ground floor which was shared with the neighbouring weaver's family.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacKay pp23-24&quot;&gt;MacKay ''Little Boss: A life of Andrew Carnegie'' pp.23–24.&lt;/ref&gt; The main room served as a living room, dining room and bedroom.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacKay pp23-24&quot; /&gt; He was named after his paternal [[grandfather]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MacKay pp23-24&quot; /&gt; In 1836, the family moved to a larger house in Edgar Street (opposite Reid's Park), following the demand for more heavy damask which his father, William Carnegie, benefited from.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacKay pp23-24&quot; /&gt; His uncle, George Lauder, whom he referred to as &quot;Dod&quot;, introduced him to the writings of [[Robert Burns]] and such historical Scottish heroes as [[Robert the Bruce]], [[William Wallace]], and [[Robert Roy MacGregor|Rob Roy]]. Falling on very hard times as a handloom weaver and with the country in starvation, William Carnegie decided to move with his family to [[Allegheny, Pennsylvania]] in the United States in 1848 for the prospect of a better life.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacKay pp37-38&quot;&gt;MacKay ''Little Boss:A life of Andrew Carnegie'' pp.37–38.&lt;/ref&gt; Andrew's family had to borrow money in order to migrate. Allegheny was a very poor area. His first job at age 13 in 1848 was as a [[bobbin boy]], changing spools of thread in a cotton mill 12 hours a day, 6 days a week. His starting wage was $1.20 per week.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=RekoAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=titlepage&amp;dq=Carnegie+knows+the+presid... Autobiography of Andrew Carnegie] p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; Andrew's father, William Carnegie, started off working in a cotton mill but then would earn money weaving and peddling linens. His mother, Margaret Morrison Carnegie, earned money by binding shoes.

In 1850, Carnegie became a telegraph messenger boy in the Pittsburgh Office of the [[Ohio Telegraph Company]], at $2.50 per week,&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=RekoAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=titlepage&amp;dq=Carnegie+knows+the+presid... Autobiography of Andrew Carnegie] p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; following the recommendation of his uncle. His new job gave him many benefits including free admission to the local theater. This made him appreciate Shakespeare's work.
He was a very hard worker and would memorize all of the locations of Pittsburgh's businesses and the faces of important men. He made many connections this way. He also paid close attention to the telegraph's instruments (he could translate the clicks of the telegraph before they appeared on the printed tape){{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} and within a year was promoted as an operator.

Carnegie's education and passion for reading was given a great boost by Colonel James Anderson, who opened his personal library of 400 volumes to working boys each Saturday night. Carnegie was a consistent borrower and a &quot;self-made man&quot; in both his economic development and his intellectual and cultural development. His capacity, willingness for hard work, his perseverance, and his alertness soon brought forth opportunities. At work, Carnegie quickly taught himself to distinguish the differing sounds the incoming telegraph signals produced and learned to transcribe signals by ear, without having to write them down.

Starting in 1853, [[Tom Scott (PRR)|Thomas A. Scott]] of the [[Pennsylvania Railroad Company]] employed Carnegie as a secretary/telegraph operator at a salary of $4.00 per week. At age 18, the youth began a rapid advancement through the company, becoming the superintendent of the Pittsburgh Division. His employment by the Pennsylvania Railroad Company would be vital to his later success. The railroads were the first big businesses in America, and the Pennsylvania was one of the largest of them all. Carnegie learned much about management and cost control during these years, and from Scott in particular.&lt;ref&gt;Nasaw, David, ''Andrew Carnegie'' (New York: The Penguin Press, 2006), pp. 54–59, 64–65.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scott also helped him with his first investments. Many of these were part of the corruption indulged in by Scott and the Pennsylvania's president, J. Edgar Thomson, which consisted of inside trading in companies that the railroad did business with, or payoffs made by contracting parties &quot;as part of a quid pro quo,&quot; as biographer David Nasaw writes.&lt;ref&gt;Nasaw, pp. 59–60.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1855, Scott made it possible for Carnegie to invest $500 in the [[Adams Express Company|Adams Express]], which contracted with the Pennsylvania to carry its messengers. The money was secured by the act of his mother placing a $500 mortgage on the family's $700 home, but the opportunity was only available because of Carnegie's close relationship with Scott.&lt;ref&gt;Nasaw, pp. 59–60; [http://books.google.com/books?id=RekoAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=titlepage&amp;dq=Carnegie+knows+the+presid... Autobiography of Andrew Carnegie] p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; A few years later, he received a few shares in T.T. Woodruff's sleeping car company, as a reward for holding shares that Woodruff had given to Scott and Thomson, as a payoff. Reinvesting his returns in such inside investments in railroad-related industries: ([[iron]], [[bridge]]s, and [[rails]]), Carnegie slowly accumulated capital, the basis for his later success. Throughout his later career, he made use of his close connection to Thomson and Scott as he established businesses that supplied rails and bridges to the railroad, offering the two men a stake in his enterprises.&lt;ref&gt;Nasaw, pp. 59–60, 85–88, 102–104, 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

====1860–1865: The Civil War====
Before the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], Carnegie arranged a merger between Woodruff's company and that of George M Pullman, the inventor of a [[sleeping car]] for [[first class travel]] which facilitated business travel at distances over {{convert|500|mi|km}}. The investment proved a great success and a source of profit for Woodruff and Carnegie. The young Carnegie continued to work for the Pennsylvania's Tom Scott, and introduced several improvements in the service.

In spring 1861, Carnegie was appointed by Scott, who was now Assistant Secretary of War in charge of [[military]] transportation, as Superintendent of the Military Railways and the Union Government's telegraph lines in the East. Carnegie helped open the rail lines into Washington D.C. that the rebels had cut; he rode the locomotive pulling the first brigade of Union troops to reach Washington D.C. Following the defeat of Union forces at [[First Battle of Bull Run|Bull Run]], he personally supervised the transportation of the defeated forces. Under his organization, the telegraph service rendered efficient service to the Union cause and significantly assisted in the eventual victory. Carnegie later joked that he was &quot;the first casualty of the war&quot; when he gained a scar on his cheek from freeing a trapped telegraph wire.

Defeat of the Confederacy required vast supplies of [[munition]]s, as well as railroads (and telegraph lines) to deliver the goods. The war demonstrated how integral the industries were to American success.

In 1864, Carnegie invested $40,000 in Story Farm on Oil Creek in [[Venango County, Pennsylvania]]. In one year, the farm yielded over $1,000,000 in cash dividends, and petroleum from oil wells on the property sold profitably. The demand for iron products, such as armor for gunboats, cannon, and shells, as well as a hundred other industrial products, made Pittsburgh a center of wartime production. Carnegie worked with others in establishing a steel [[rolling mill]] and steel production and control of industry became the source of his fortune. Carnegie had some investments in the iron industry before the war.

After the war, Carnegie left the railroads to devote all his energies to the ironworks trade. Carnegie worked to develop several iron works, eventually forming The Keystone Bridge Works and the Union Ironworks, in Pittsburgh. Although he had left the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, he remained closely connected to its management, namely Thomas A. Scott and J. Edgar Thomson. He used his connection to the two men to acquire contracts for his Keystone Bridge Company and the rails produced by his ironworks. He also gave stock to Scott and Thomson in his businesses, and the Pennsylvania was his best customer. When he built his first steel plant, he made a point of naming it after Thomson. As well as having good business sense, Carnegie possessed charm and literary knowledge. He was invited to many important social functions—functions that Carnegie exploited to his own advantage.&lt;ref&gt;Nasaw, pp. 105–107.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Andrew Carnegie circa 1878 - Project Gutenberg eText 17976.jpg|thumb|Carnegie, circa 1878]]

Carnegie believed in using his fortune for others and doing more than making money. He wrote: {{quote|I propose to take an income no greater than $50,000 per annum! Beyond this I need ever earn, make no effort to increase my fortune, but spend the surplus each year for benevolent purposes! Let us cast aside business forever, except for others. Let us settle in Oxford and I shall get a thorough education, making the acquaintance of literary men. I figure that this will take three years active work. I shall pay especial attention to speaking in public. We can settle in London and I can purchase a controlling interest in some newspaper or live review and give the general management of it attention, taking part in public matters, especially those connected with education and improvement of the poorer classes. Man must have an idol and the amassing of wealth is one of the worst species of [[idolatry]]! No idol is more debasing than the [[worship]] of money! Whatever I engage in I must push inordinately; therefore should I be careful to choose that life which will be the most elevating in its character. To continue much longer overwhelmed by business cares and with most of my thoughts wholly upon the way to make more money in the shortest time, must degrade me beyond hope of permanent recovery. I will resign business at thirty-five, but during these ensuing two years I wish to spend the afternoons in receiving instruction and in reading systematically!}}

====1880–1900: Scholar and activist====
Carnegie continued his business career; some of his literary intentions were fulfilled. He befriended English poet [[Matthew Arnold]] and English philosopher [[Herbert Spencer]] as well as being in correspondence and acquaintance with most of the [[President of the United States|U.S. Presidents]],&lt;ref&gt;John K. Winkler ''Incredible Carnegie'', p. 172, Read Books, 2006 ISBN 978-1406729467&lt;/ref&gt; statesmen, and notable writers.&lt;ref&gt;John K. Winkler ''Incredible Carnegie'', p. 13, Read Books, 2006 ISBN 978-1406729467&lt;/ref&gt;

Carnegie erected commodious swimming-baths for the people of his hometown in [[Dunfermline]] in 1879. In the following year, Carnegie gave $40,000 for the establishment of a free library in Dunfermline. In 1884, he gave $50,000 to [[Bellevue Hospital Medical College]] (now part of [[New York University Medical Center]]) to found a [[histology|histological]] laboratory, now called the [[Carnegie Laboratory]].

In 1881, Carnegie took his family, including his 70 year-old mother, on a trip to the United Kingdom. They toured Scotland by coach, and enjoyed several receptions en-route. The highlight for them all was a triumphal return to Dunfermline, where Carnegie's mother laid the foundation stone of a Carnegie Library for which he donated the money. Carnegie's criticism of British society did not mean dislike; on the contrary, one of Carnegie's ambitions was to act as a [[catalyst]] for a close association between the English-speaking peoples. To this end, in the early 1880s, he purchased numerous newspapers in England, all of which were to advocate the abolition of the monarchy and the establishment of &quot;the British Republic&quot;. Carnegie's charm aided by his great wealth meant that he had many British friends, including [[Prime Minister]] [[William Ewart Gladstone]].

In 1886, Andrew Carnegie's younger brother Thomas died at age 43. Success in the business continued, however. While owning steel works, Carnegie had purchased at low cost the most valuable of the [[iron ore]] fields around [[Lake Superior]]. The same year Carnegie became a figure of controversy. Following his tour of the UK, he wrote about his experiences in a book entitled ''[[An American Four-in-hand in Britain]]''. Although still actively involved in running his many businesses, Carnegie had become a regular contributor to numerous magazines, most notably the ''[[Nineteenth Century (periodical)|Nineteenth Century]]'', under the editorship of [[James Knowles (architect)|James Knowles]], and the influential ''North American Review'', led by editor [[Lloyd Bryce]].

In 1886, Carnegie wrote his most radical work to date, entitled ''Triumphant Democracy''. Liberal in its use of statistics to make its arguments, the book argued his view that the American [[republic]]an system of government was superior to the British [[monarchy|monarchical]] system. It gave a highly favorable and idealized view of American progress and criticized the British royal family. The cover depicted an upended royal [[Crown (headgear)|crown]] and a broken scepter. The book created considerable controversy in the UK. The book made many Americans appreciate their country's economic progress and sold over 40,000 copies, mostly in the U.S.

In 1889, Carnegie published [http://www.swarthmore.edu/SocSci/rbannis1/AIH19th/Carnegie.html &quot;Wealth&quot;] in the June issue of the ''North American Review''. After reading it, Gladstone requested its publication in England, where it appeared as &quot;The Gospel of Wealth&quot; in the ''[[Pall Mall Gazette]]''. The article was the subject of much discussion. Carnegie argued that the life of a wealthy industrialist should comprise two parts. The first part was the gathering and the accumulation of wealth. The second part was for the subsequent distribution of this wealth to benevolent causes. The philanthropy was key to making the life worthwhile.

Carnegie was also known to be a great journalist. This came about from his experience in constantly writing to newspapers and to their editors. His knowledge in reading newspapers stems from a habit from his childhood.&lt;ref&gt;Swetnam, George (1980) ''Andrew Carnegie''. Twayne Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; He also would go on to publish three books on travel. One of them entitled &quot;Round the world&quot; he began writing while traveling England and Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;Livesay, Harold (2000) &quot;Andrew Carnegie and the rise of big business&quot;. Addison-Wesley Educational Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1898, Carnegie tried to arrange for independence for the Philippines. As the end of the [[Spanish American War]] neared, the United States bought the Philippines from Spain for $20 million [[United States dollar|USD]]. To counter what he perceived as imperialism on the part of the United States, Carnegie personally offered $20 million USD to the Philippines so that the [[Filipino people]] could buy their independence from the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/carnegie/timeline/timeline2.html Andrew Carnegie timeline of events at PBS.org]&lt;/ref&gt; However, nothing came of this gesture and the [[Philippine-American War]] ensued.

Carnegie opposed the annexation of [[Cuba]] by the United States and in this, was successful with many other conservatives who founded an [[anti-imperialist league]] that included former presidents of the United States, [[Grover Cleveland]] and [[Benjamin Harrison]], and literary figures like [[Mark Twain]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert P. Porter ''Industrial Cuba'', p. 43, G. P. Putnam's Sons, 1899&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Katherine Hirschfeld ''Health, Politics and Revolution in Cuba'', p. 117, Transaction Publishers, 2008 ISBN 978-1412808637&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=t2goAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=andrew+carnegie+Cuba&amp;lr= Industrial Cuba]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Industrialist===
====1885–1900: Empire of Steel====
Carnegie made his fortune in the steel industry, controlling the most extensive integrated iron and steel operations ever owned by an individual in the United States. One of his two great innovations was in the cheap and efficient mass production of steel rails for railroad lines. The second was in his [[vertical integration]] of all suppliers of raw materials. In the late 1880s, Carnegie Steel was the largest manufacturer of [[pig iron]], steel rails, and [[coke (fuel)|coke]] in the world, with a capacity to produce approximately 2,000 tons of [[pig iron|pig metal]] per day. In 1888, Carnegie bought the rival [[Homestead Steel Works]], which included an extensive plant served by tributary [[coal]] and iron fields, a 425-mile (685&amp;nbsp;km) long railway, and a line of [[Great Lakes freighter|lake steamships]]. Carnegie combined his assets and those of his associates in 1892 with the launching of the [[Carnegie Steel Company]].

By 1889, the U.S. output of steel exceeded that of the UK, and Carnegie owned a large part of it. Carnegie's empire grew to include the [[Edgar Thomson Steel Works|J. Edgar Thomson Steel Works]], (named for [[John Edgar Thomson]], Carnegie's former boss and president of the Pennsylvania Railroad), Pittsburgh Bessemer Steel Works, the Lucy Furnaces, the Union Iron Mills, the Union Mill (Wilson, Walker &amp; County), the Keystone Bridge Works, the Hartman Steel Works, the Frick Coke Company, and the Scotia ore mines. Carnegie, through Keystone, supplied the steel for and owned shares in the landmark [[Eads Bridge]] project across the [[Mississippi River]] at [[St. Louis, Missouri]] (completed 1874). This project was an important proof-of-concept for steel technology, which marked the opening of a new steel market.

====1901: U.S. Steel====
In 1901, Carnegie was 66 years of age and considering retirement. He reformed his enterprises into conventional joint stock corporations as preparation to this end. [[John Pierpont Morgan]] was a banker and perhaps America's most important financial deal maker. He had observed how efficiently Carnegie produced profit. He envisioned an integrated steel industry that would cut costs, lower prices to consumers, produce in greater quantities and raise wages to workers. To this end, he needed to buy out Carnegie and several other major producers and integrate them into one company, thereby eliminating duplication and waste. He concluded negotiations on March 2, 1901, and formed the [[United States Steel Corporation]]. It was the first corporation in the world with a market capitalization over $1 billion.

The buyout, secretly negotiated by [[Charles M. Schwab]] (no relation to [[Charles R. Schwab]]), was the largest such industrial takeover in United States history to date. The holdings were incorporated in the United States Steel Corporation, a trust organized by Morgan, and Carnegie retired from business. His steel enterprises were bought out at a figure equivalent to 12 times their annual earnings—$480 million (approximately $10.3 billion in 2003 prices- according to Gale Virtual Reference Library)—which at the time was the largest ever personal commercial transaction.

Carnegie's share of this amounted to $225,639,000, which was paid to Carnegie in the form of 5%, 50-year gold bonds. The letter agreeing to sell his share was signed on February 26, 1901. On March 2, the circular formally filing the organization and capitalization (at $1,400,000,000—4% of U.S. national wealth at the time) of the United States Steel Corporation actually completed the contract. The bonds were to be delivered within two weeks to the Hudson Trust Company of [[Hoboken, New Jersey]], in trust to Robert A. Franks, Carnegie's business secretary. There, a special vault was built to house the physical bulk of nearly $230,000,000 worth of bonds. It was said that &quot;...Carnegie never wanted to see or touch these bonds that represented the fruition of his business career. It was as if he feared that if he looked upon them they might vanish like the gossamer gold of the leprechaun. Let them lie safe in a vault in New Jersey, safe from the New York tax assessors, until he was ready to dispose of them...&quot;

===Retirement===
====1901–1919: Philanthropist====

[[Image:Macomb Public Library.JPG|left|thumb| A Carnegie library, [[Macomb, Illinois]]]]

Carnegie spent his last years as a [[philanthropist]]. From 1901 forward, public attention was turned from the shrewd business acumen which had enabled Carnegie to accumulate such a fortune, to the public-spirited way in which he devoted himself to utilizing it on philanthropic projects. He had written about his views on social subjects and the responsibilities of great wealth in ''Triumphant Democracy'' (1886) and ''[[Gospel of Wealth]]'' (1889). Carnegie bought [[Skibo Castle]] in Scotland, and made his home partly there and partly in New York. He then devoted his life to providing the capital for purposes of public interest and social and educational advancement.

&lt;!--ref? In all his ideas, Carnegie intensely believed in the future and influence of the English-speaking people, in their democratic government and alliance for the purpose of peace and the abolition of war, and in the progress of education on non-sectarian lines.--&gt;
He was a powerful supporter of the movement for [[spelling reform]] as a means of promoting the spread of the [[English language]].

Among his many philanthropic efforts, the establishment of [[public library|public libraries]] throughout the United States, the United Kingdom, and other English-speaking countries was especially prominent. [[Carnegie library|Carnegie libraries]], as they were commonly called, were built in many places. The first was opened in 1883 in Dunfermline. His method was to build and equip, but only on condition that the local authority matched that by providing the land and a budget for operation and maintenance. To secure local interest, in 1885, he gave $500,000 to Pittsburgh for a public library, and in 1886, he gave $250,000 to Allegheny City for a music hall and library; and $250,000 to [[Edinburgh]] for a free library. In total Carnegie funded some 3,000 libraries, located in 47 US states, and also in Canada, the United Kingdom, what is now the [[Republic of Ireland]], Australia, New Zealand, the [[West Indies]], and [[Fiji]]. He also donated £50,000 to help set up the [[University of Birmingham]] in 1899.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ecommons.library.cornell.edu/bitstream/1813/3164/11/002_10.pdf The Carnegie Committee], ''Cornell Alumni News'', II(10), 29 November 1899, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Syracuse Carnegie Library.jpg|thumb|left| [[Syracuse University|Carnegie Library at Syracuse University]]]]

As VanSlyck (1991) showed, the last years of the 19th century saw acceptance of the idea that free libraries should be available to the American public. But the design of the idealized free library was the subject of prolonged and heated debate. On one hand, the library profession called for designs that supported efficiency in administration and operation; on the other, wealthy philanthropists favored buildings that reinforced the paternalistic metaphor and enhanced civic pride. Between 1886 and 1917, Carnegie reformed both library philanthropy and library design, encouraging a closer correspondence between the two.

The Broome County Public Library in New York opened in October 1904. Originally called the Binghamton Public Library, it was created with a gift of $75,000 from Andrew Carnegie. The building was designed to serve as both a public library and a community center.

He gave $2 million in 1901 to start the [[Carnegie Institute of Technology]] (CIT) at Pittsburgh and the same amount in 1902 to found the [[Carnegie Institution]] at Washington, D.C. He later contributed more to these and other schools. CIT is now part of [[Carnegie Mellon University]]. Carnegie served on the Board of [[Cornell University]].

[[Image:CMU Hamerschlag Hall.jpg|thumb|right| [[Carnegie Mellon University]]]]

In 1911, Andrew Carnegie became a sympathetic benefactor to [[George Ellery Hale]], who was trying to build the 100&amp;nbsp;inch (2.5&amp;nbsp;m) [[Mount_Wilson_Observatory#100_inch_.282.5_m.29_Hooker_telescope|Hooker telescope]] at [[Mount Wilson Observatory|Mount Wilson]], and donated an additional ten million dollars to the [[Carnegie Institution for Science|Carnegie Institution]] with the following suggestion to expedite the construction of the [[telescope]]: &quot;I hope the work at Mount Wilson will be vigorously pushed, because I am so anxious to hear the expected results from it. I should like to be satisfied before I depart, that we are going to repay to the old land some part of the debt we owe them by revealing more clearly than ever to them the new heavens.&quot; The telescope saw [[First light (astronomy)|first light]] on November 2, 1917, with Carnegie still alive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mtwilson.edu/his/art/g1a4.php History of Mount Wilson Observatory&amp;nbsp;– Building the 100-Inch Telescope]. Article was written by Mike Simmons in 1984 for the [[Mount Wilson Observatory Association]] (MWOA)&lt;/ref&gt;

In Scotland, he gave $10 million in 1901 to establish the [[Carnegie Trust for the Universities of Scotland]], It was created by a Deed which he signed on 7 June 1901, and it was incorporated by Royal Charter on August 21, 1902. The Trust was funded by a gift of $10 million (a then unprecedented sum: at the time, total government assistance to all four Scottish universities was about £50,000 a year) and its aim was to improve and extend the opportunities for scientific research in the Scottish universities and to enable the deserving and qualified youth of Scotland to attend a university,.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carnegie-trust.org/our_history.htm Carnegie Trust for the Universities of Scotland]&lt;/ref&gt; He was subsequently elected [[Lord Rector]] of [[University of St. Andrews]]. He also donated large sums of money to Dunfermline, the place of his birth. In addition to a library, Carnegie also bought the private estate which became [[Pittencrieff Park]] and opened it to all members of the public, establishing the Carnegie Dunfermline Trust&lt;ref&gt;{{Scottish charity|SC015710|Carnegie Dunfermline Trust}}&lt;/ref&gt; to benefit the people of Dunfermline. A statue of him stands there today. He gave a further $10 million in 1913 to endow the [[Carnegie United Kingdom Trust]], a grant-making foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Scottish charity|SC012799|Carnegie United Kingdom Trust}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carnegieuktrust.org.uk Carnegie United Kingdom Trust website]&lt;/ref&gt;

Carnegie also established large pension funds in 1901 for his former employees at Homestead and, in 1905, for American college professors. The latter fund evolved into [[TIAA-CREF]]. One critical requirement was that church-related schools had to sever their religious connections to get his money.

His interest in music led him to fund construction of 7,000 church organs. He built and owned [[Carnegie Hall]] in New York City.

Carnegie was a large benefactor of the [[Tuskegee Institute]] under [[Booker T. Washington]] for [[African-American]] education. He helped [[Booker T. Washington]] create the [[National Negro Business League]].

He founded the [[Carnegie Hero Fund]] for the United States and Canada in 1904 (a few years later also established in the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Norway, Sweden, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, and Germany) for the recognition of deeds of heroism. Carnegie contributed $1,500,000 in 1903 for the erection of the [[Peace Palace]] at [[The Hague]]; and he donated $150,000 for a [[Pan-American Palace]] in Washington as a home for the International Bureau of American Republics.

Carnegie was honored for his philanthropy and support of the arts by initiation as an honorary member of [[Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia]] Fraternity on October 14, 1917 at the [[New England Conservatory|New England Conservatory of Music]] in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]]. The fraternity's mission reflects Carnegie's values by developing young men to share their talents to create harmony in the world.

By the standards of 19th century tycoons, Carnegie was not a particularly ruthless man but a humanitarian with enough acquisitiveness to go in the ruthless pursuit of money;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Krause ''The Battle for Homestead 1880–1892'', p. 233, University of Pittsburgh Press, 1992 ISBN 978-0822954668&lt;/ref&gt; on the other hand, the contrast between his life and the lives of many of his own workers and of the poor, in general, was stark. &quot;Maybe with the giving away of his money,&quot; commented biographer [[Joseph Frazier Wall|Joseph Wall]], &quot;he would justify what he had done to get that money.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/carnegie/filmmore/description.html The American Experience | Andrew Carnegie | Program Description&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Andrew Carnegie represents to some what is the idea of the American dream. He was an immigrant from Scotland who came to America and became successful. He is not only known for his successes but his enormous amounts of philanthropist works, not only to charities but also to promote democracy and independence to colonized countries.&lt;ref&gt;Swetnam, George.

Carnegie was one of more than 50 members of the [[South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club]], which was blamed for the [[Johnstown Flood]] that killed 2,209 people in 1889.

At the suggestion of his friend Benjamin Ruff, Carnegie's partner [[Henry Clay Frick]] had formed the exclusive South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club high above Johnstown, Pennsylvania. The charter members of the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club were: Benjamin Ruff; T. H. Sweat; Charles J. Clarke; Thomas Clark; Walter F. Fundenberg; Howard Hartley; Henry C. Yeager; J. B. White; Henry Clay Frick; E. A. Myers; C. C. Hussey; D. R. Ewer; C. A. Carpenter; W. L. Dunn; W. L. McClintock; and A. V. Holmes.

The sixty-odd club members were the leading business tycoons of Western Pennsylvania and included among their number Frick's best friend, [[Andrew W. Mellon|Andrew Mellon]], his attorneys [[Philander Knox]] and James Hay Reed, as well as Frick's business partner Andrew Carnegie. High above the city, near the small town of South Fork, the [[South Fork Dam]] was originally built between 1838 and 1853 by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania as part of a canal system to be used as a reservoir for a canal basin in Johnstown. With the coming-of-age of railroads superseding canal barge transport, the lake was abandoned by the Commonwealth, sold to the Pennsylvania Railroad, and sold again to private interests and eventually came to be owned by the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club in 1881. Less than 20 miles downstream from the dam sat the city of Johnstown, and Carnegie Steel's chief competitor (from whom Carnegie had hired away steelmaking expert Bill Jones), the Cambria Iron and Steel Company, which boasted the world's largest annual steel production.

Poor maintenance, a reduction in height, and unusually high snowmelt and heavy spring rains combined to cause the dam to give way on May 31, 1889 resulting in twenty million tons of water to sweep down the valley causing the [[Johnstown Flood]]. When word of the dam's failure was telegraphed to Pittsburgh, Frick and other members of the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club gathered to form the Pittsburgh Relief Committee for assistance to the flood victims as well as determining never to speak publicly about the club or the flood. This strategy was a success, and Knox and Reed were able to fend off all lawsuits that would have placed blame upon the club's members.

Although Cambria Iron and Steel's facilities were heavily damaged by the flood, they returned to full production within a year and a half. By that time, Carnegie's steel production had outstripped Cambria's. After the flood, Carnegie built Johnstown a new library to replace the one built by Cambria's chief legal counsel Cyrus Elder, which was destroyed in the flood. The Carnegie-donated library is now owned by the Johnstown Area Heritage Association, and houses the Flood Museum.

===1892: Homestead Strike===
[[Image:Homesteadstrike.jpg|thumb|right|The Homestead Strike]]
The [[Homestead Strike]] was a bloody labor confrontation lasting 143 days in 1892, one of the most serious in U.S. history. The conflict was centered on Carnegie Steel's main plant in [[Homestead, Pennsylvania]], and grew out of a dispute between the National Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers of the United States and the Carnegie Steel Company.

Carnegie left on a trip to Scotland before the unrest peaked. In doing so, Carnegie left mediation of the dispute in the hands of his associate and partner [[Henry Clay Frick]]. Frick was well known in industrial circles for maintaining staunch anti-union sensibilities.

After a recent increase in profits by 60%, the company refused to raise worker's pay by more than 30%. When some of the workers demanded the full 60%, management locked the union out. Workers considered the stoppage a &quot;[[lockout (industry)|lockout]]&quot; by management and not a &quot;[[Strike action|strike]]&quot; by workers. As such, the workers would have been well within their rights to protest, and subsequent government action would have been a set of criminal procedures designed to crush what was seen as a pivotal demonstration of the growing labor rights movement, strongly opposed by management. Frick brought in thousands of strikebreakers to work the steel mills and [[Pinkerton National Detective Agency|Pinkerton]] agents to safeguard them.

On 6 July, the arrival of a force of 300 Pinkerton agents from New York City and Chicago resulted in a fight in which 10 men—seven strikers and three Pinkertons—were killed and hundreds were injured. Pennsylvania Governor [[Robert E. Pattison|Robert Pattison]] ordered two brigades of state militia to the strike site. Then, allegedly in response to the fight between the striking workers and the Pinkertons, [[Anarchism|anarchist]] [[Alexander Berkman]] shot at Frick in an attempted assassination, wounding Frick. While not directly connected to the strike, Berkman was tied in for the assassination attempt. According to Berkman, &quot;...with the elimination of Frick, responsibility for Homestead conditions would rest with Carnegie.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Berkman ''Prison Memoirs of an Anarchist'', p. 67, Mother Earth Publishing Association, 1912&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=FC4UAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=Alexander+Berkman&amp;lr= Prison Memoirs of an Anarchist by Alexander Berkman]&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, the company successfully resumed operations with non-union immigrant employees in place of the Homestead plant workers, and Carnegie returned to the United States. However, Carnegie's reputation was permanently damaged by the Homestead events.

===Andrew Carnegie Dictum===
In his final days, Andrew Carnegie suffered from bronchial pneumonia. Before his death on 11 August 1919, Mr. Carnegie had donated $350,695,654 for various causes. The 'Andrew Carnegie Dictum' illustrates Carnegie's generous nature:
*To spend the first third of one's life getting all the education one can.
*To spend the next third making all the money one can.
*To spend the last third giving it all away for worthwhile causes.
Andrew Carnegie was involved in philanthropist causes, but he kept himself away from religious circles. He wanted to be identified by the world as a 'positivist'. He was highly influenced in public life by John Bright.

As early as 1868, at age 33, he drafted a memo to himself. He wrote: &quot;...The amassing of wealth is one of the worse species of idolatry. No idol more debasing than the worship of money.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Maury Klein ''The Change Makers'', p. 57, Macmillan, 2004 ISBN 978-0805075182&lt;/ref&gt;
In order to avoid degrading himself, he wrote in the same memo he would retire at age 35 to pursue the practice of philanthropic giving for &quot;...the man who dies thus rich dies disgraced.&quot; However, he did not begin his philanthropic work in all earnest until 1881, with the gift of a library to his hometown of Dunfermline, Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;Dwight Burlingame ''Philanthropy in America'', p. 60, ABC-CLIO, 2004 ISBN 978-1576078600&lt;/ref&gt;

Carnegie wrote &quot;[[The Gospel of Wealth]]&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=RekoAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=titlepage&amp;dq=Carnegie+knows+the+presid... Autobiography of Andrew Carnegie] pp. 255–67&lt;/ref&gt; an article in which he stated his belief that the rich should use their wealth to help enrich society.

The following is taken from one of Carnegie's memos to himself: {{quote|Man does not live by bread alone. I have known millionaires starving for lack of the nutriment which alone can sustain all that is human in man, and I know workmen, and many so-called poor men, who revel in luxuries beyond the power of those millionaires to reach. It is the mind that makes the body rich. There is no class so pitiably wretched as that which possesses money and nothing else.  Money can only be the useful drudge of things immeasurably higher than itself. Exalted beyond this, as it sometimes is, it remains Caliban still and still plays the beast. My aspirations take a higher flight. Mine be it to have contributed to the enlightenment and the joys of the mind, to the things of the spirit, to all that tends to bring into the lives of the toilers of Pittsburgh sweetness and light. I hold this the noblest possible use of wealth.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}}}

In 1908, he commissioned (at no pay) [[Napoleon Hill]], then a journalist, to interview more than 500 wealthy achievers to find out the common threads of their success. Hill eventually became a Carnegie collaborator. Their work was published in 1928 after Carnegie's death in Hill's book ''[[The Law of Success]]'' (ISBN
